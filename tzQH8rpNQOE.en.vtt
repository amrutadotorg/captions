00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.560
By the Divine.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:09.370
For example, if I know only my head, that
is not sufficient.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.029
If I know only my neck, that is not sufficient.

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:16.820
If I know only my leg, that is not sufficient.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:31.020
But, the more I know about myself the more
dynamic I become: The more expansive I become.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:45.600
And all the great, that existed, or all the
people who were called as great, are great

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.210
because they lived in many human beings.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:04.220
I feel that warmth in the atmosphere, as you
are feeling because you know they are not

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.740
foreigners, they are your brothers and sisters.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.579
There are so many stories in Puranas like
this that...

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:28.510
I will not name it, but once two brothers
met in a jungle.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:37.149
But they thought that they were enemies and
they wanted to fight with each other, and

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.719
when they came too close they couldn't hit
each other.

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:48.979
Then they took out their arrows, the arrows
wouldn't work.

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:57.249
They were quite surprised at this and when
they asked each other, "Who is your mother?,"

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:01.999
they found out, mother was the same.

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:11.160
And then they realized that they were not
foreigners neither enemies but they were made

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.940
of the same fiber.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:30.450
What sweetness, what beauty that knowledge
has given them, and what security of understanding

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.960
that everywhere in the whole world we have
brothers and sisters who are on their inner

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:49.320
being, on their divine, and how we are bound
together with that love.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:56.360
When I talk of love, people think that I am
trying to make you weak people - because people

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.220
think those who love are weak.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.640
But the most dynamic power in this world is
that of love.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:17.850
Is the most aggressive power - is that of
love.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:25.950
Even when we suffer, in love, it is out of
our strength that we suffer and not out of

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.170
our weakness.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:47.600
For example, there was a teacher in China
who used to teach the cocks how to fight.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.209
And the king of that place took his cocks
to that teacher and told him that you please

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.580
teach them how to fight.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:05.690
After one month, when the king went to take
those cocks with him, he was surprised that

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.830
the cocks where just silent doing nothing.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.230
And he told the teacher that, "What have you
done to my cocks?

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.670
They are not at all aggressive.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.360
They are not doing anything.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.659
How are they going to fight it out?

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:20.789
There's going to be a race.

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:26.180
There's going to be an exhibition of their
strength and what are we going to do about

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.180
it?"

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.650
He said, "You just take them."

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:37.159
He took those two cocks with him, and put
them in the arena where there were other cocks

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.729
who had come to fight.

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.229
These two cocks were very nicely standing.

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.779
All the other cocks started coaxing and torturing.

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:54.860
They were just standing and looking at them.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:03.710
All the other cocks were surprised at their
behavior and thought that they were very powerful.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.199
And they all fled away.

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:21.210
The love that I am talking about - the divine
love - makes you not only strong but dynamic.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:31.169
It is the greatest luminous power that we
can think of.

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:43.789
Only when love is surrounded by gross, and
is lost in the gross, it looks as if it is

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.639
weak and under chains.

00:05:45.639 --> 00:06:00.259
The time it is released, the dynamic power
of love can transcend all the evil powers

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.909
of the world.

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:14.990
When people get their realization, automatically
the ego drops out - to a great extent I should

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.990
say.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:26.879
Because, you say that the vibrations are passing;
you don't say that you are giving them.

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:41.389
Because the dropping of the ego sometimes
it happens that you feel that whatever you

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.909
wanted to have you have got it, and you better
not talk about it.

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:55.810
When there is any opposition from anywhere,
you shun it and sit away from it.

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:03.849
You don't want to face the opposition of any
negative opposition - whether it is by speech

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:06.819
or by... even by evil methods.

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:10.090
We run away from that thinking, "Oh god!

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:15.400
How are we going to face it?"

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:19.800
On the contrary a person who is negative,
who has got hatred becomes tiresomely[word

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:27.529
not clear sounds like schizmoid] they call
it means a person who talks big.

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:30.520
Such a person talks...

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.759
starts talking big.

00:07:32.759 --> 00:07:40.710
He thinks he is above everybody else, he can
befool all the world; He takes a responsibility

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.710
on himself.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:49.689
He starts a big ashram or some big place where
he sits down with all his ignorance and starts

00:07:49.689 --> 00:07:56.300
spreading his knowledge - the so called - to
people.

00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:05.719
By his methods people get impressed and they
all go and fall at his feet.

00:08:05.719 --> 00:08:15.099
While the realized sits at home quietly wondering,
"What are these fools doing?"

00:08:15.099 --> 00:08:23.319
But, it is not now for the realized to sit
down and to wonder and laugh at the foolishness

00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:27.059
of the people who are not yet realized.

00:08:27.059 --> 00:08:36.280
Not even to take pity on them, but to come
out, come out with the sword of love to win

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.370
the whole world.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:38.820
It is very, very essential.

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:54.650
If the creation has to be saved, then you
are not to keep mum about it.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:09:03.280
All the wrong ideas about love, all the falsehood
about love, has to be given up.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.570
One must know that it is the dynamic power.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:16.050
And it won't allow you to sit comfortably
with yourself, enjoying the peace and the

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:26.160
bliss, when the rest of the world is not enjoying
that and is playing into the hands of the

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:42.750
evil geniuses who have come in this world
to destroy and to bring the satanic realm

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.750
on this earth.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.670
Now the days are gone when the people had
to suffer.

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:50.460
Christ suffered for us.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:57.620
Of course, Christ never suffered, because
He never suffered.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.000
He never wept.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.150
He was like those cocks, a very powerful personality.

00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:22.910
But today is the day to brighten up your understanding
about your own strength that is within you.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:34.050
Those who are gross should worry about their
insecurities and their problems and their

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:39.880
organizations - but not for the people who
are realized.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:45.160
I have told you many a times and today he
also remarked that you should know you are

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.130
never alone when you are realized.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:53.930
There have been many people who have been
realized, before even you were born, who exist,

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:59.790
who are anxious to help you at every moment.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:10.950
In our shastras [Hindi/Sanskrit meaning scriptures]
we call them Chiranjivas [Hindi/Sanskrit meaning

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:14.240
eternal beings], you know them.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:23.040
They are people who are Niranjanas, as he
said about Bhairava and Hanumana.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:34.450
All these people exist and they are waiting
just for a call from you.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:54.840
Once we went to the market 
and there was a problem about something, and

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:59.220
I had somebody with me - a disciple - who
was also with me.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:03.090
I just wanted to see what will be his reaction.

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:07.420
He tried to argue out with a person to tell
him about something.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.800
So he told Me, "Mataji let us go now."

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:14.190
When we came out the shop, I said, "What are
you going to about it?"

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:19.070
He said, "I have already told Hanuman to look
after that part."

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:20.470
And the work was done.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:25.730
It is gross, but it happens.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:33.180
When they fail, you can leave it to anyone
of them and they will have to jolly well do

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.180
it.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:37.660
Because, it is you who are on the stage and
not they.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.210
They are the background people.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:44.430
They are the play back.

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:50.360
But you must open your mouth otherwise if
they start thinking, what will people say?

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:58.650
They are going to help you in every way, but
how far are you standing on your security?

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:05.290
How far you are standing on your property,
on your understanding of yourself?

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:12.330
It's a great war going on.

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.430
You are not aware of it.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.430
Some of you are.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:31.630
Some of you are definitely aware of it because
they have had the experience of fighting 

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:32.630
it out.

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:34.110
It's a big war on.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:43.040
Now specially when ten rakshasas [meaning
demons] have taken their avataras [meaning

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.040
incarnations].

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:56.540
And for you to be so feeble - you are still
small children, no doubt, because you got

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.470
your realization only a few days back.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.540
But if you want, you can grow very fast.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.500
You can grow into big big giants.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.600
All of you can grow.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.490
Only thing, you have to decide that you have
to grow within.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:26.910
There are so many things, that you only have
discovered, by which a person grows.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:34.540
I can give you food, but you have to grow
yourself.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:44.320
Wherever you see the negativity, you have
to stand up and say, "This is negativity and

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.400
nothing else.

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.000
Whether you like it or not."

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.220
In that, you love that person, you don't hate.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.570
Only talking sweetly, is not the idea of love.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:59.940
No, a mother sometimes even scolds the child.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.480
Doesn't mean that she doesn't love.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.740
If it is necessary, you have to tell the person
that it is negativity.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:11.270
Of course, if there is a realized person he
won't mind any correction - because he wants

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.550
the correction, he knows that it has to be
corrected.

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:17.880
The instrument has to be corrected.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:23.880
But a person who doesn't understand, you have
to force your love on that person.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.750
You can force that love - you know that - sitting
down here.

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:35.960
Many people have tried putting love around
certain people who were trying to be mischievous

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:41.000
- and they have been able to achieve great
results.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.150
Those people have turned back and come back.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:49.990
Only by putting your hand and putting your
attention on that person and moving this hand

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:55.230
like this, the love encircles, then the person
comes back.

00:15:55.230 --> 00:16:04.370
There is no doubt that there is negativity
and positivity, nothing in between these,

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.370
you must remember.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:08.840
There is no compromise between the two.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:18.450
Either it is light and darkness, or it is
positive and negative - definitely there are

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:29.400
two things that are fighting.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.779
Only thing your will - that's the trouble
in [is?] the whole joke.

00:16:32.779 --> 00:16:35.320
That your will is respected, your will is
throughout respected.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:45.850
If you have the will to be a giant that loves,
you can be.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:51.940
The other day I met a psychiatrist, and he
was catching his superego very much.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.380
I said, "What's wrong with you?"

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.279
He said, "My childhood.

00:16:56.279 --> 00:16:57.870
My childhood I couldn't get much love."

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:58.870
I said, "Now I am there.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.080
You come in my lap.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.590
Take the love."

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.959
He said, "I want to flow my love, Mother.

00:17:04.959 --> 00:17:08.870
I want to open out myself, completely, without
any fear."

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:12.829
I said, "You just start it.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:19.439
Don't worry what people are going to misunderstand.

00:17:19.439 --> 00:17:20.770
What people are going to say.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:24.420
It's nothing important what people are going
to say or anything.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:28.910
For love, the satisfaction is only love, that
you love another person."

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:33.640
"You just flow your love," I said, "and you
will feel it will work out.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:40.310
Just decide that I am going to love people.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:47.100
And once you decide that, the whole heaven,
the whole power of the heaven will fall at

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.100
your feet.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.510
You believe me in this."

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:55.040
If you see otherwise, I am an ordinary housewife.

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.640
Some people always say, "Mataji, how can we
be like this?"

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.640
Why not?

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.450
I am just like you.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.200
I have the same problems as you have.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:12.260
But only thing I know, that I am nothing but
embodiment of that love that is divine, and

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.600
I can't exist without it.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:23.910
Every moment of My life let the love flow,
let the love flow.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:27.570
Every wave of My mind conveys the love.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:37.860
And 
that makes you completely powerful.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:39.370
If you read...

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:40.850
I was reading Devi Mahatmya.

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:50.680
In that they talk about a rakshasa who faced
primordial Mother, the divine Mother, and

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.559
he laughed at Her - "You woman!

00:18:53.559 --> 00:18:55.250
What can you do to me?

00:18:55.250 --> 00:19:01.790
You are a woman, what can you do to me?"

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:09.210
And She smiled at him and said, "All right,
come along, let us see."

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:11.540
And with one stroke, She cut his throat.

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:17.510
Very clearly that shows, that positivity can
cut the throat of negativity.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.850
There is no hinsa [Hindi word meaning violence]
in that.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.650
You must remember the difference between the
two.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:28.640
If negativity is cut and positive brought
out, that is the greatest ahinsa [nonviolence]

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.030
you can do to someone.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:34.990
You have seen what negativity does to people;
you have now known what is negativity.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:40.540
You have seen how people suffer with [these?]
spirits on them.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:46.990
And here, they are also anxious to be loved
your way, you will be surprised to know that,

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.920
if you really love them.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.500
They themselves come to me and say, "Give
me salvation Mother."

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.670
They come to me only for that, sometimes with
you, that I should give them salvation.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:59.170
And if I promise that they take the birth
again.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:03.100
But, there are rakshasas, there are rakshasas.

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:13.660
As I told you the other day, the Kaliyuga
has laid a beautiful stage and a very wonderful

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:26.640
drama is to be played - in which Ravana has
to love Sita, as a mother; the Kansa has to

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.750
fall at the feet of Radha.

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:38.940
Perhaps, you do not know that Krishna wanted
to kill Kansa.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.100
At that time, he was His uncle.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:47.360
So the feeling came in Him, of His mother
- that after all he is my brother.

00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:54.640
So He asked Radha, and Radha killed him - the
Radha who loved the whole world at that time.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:21:03.070
She is the embodiment of love and She killed
Kansa because it was to be.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:11.730
When you are playing in the hands of God then
if He wants to kill somebody, it has to be

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.420
played [not clear].

00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:23.080
But first of all you have to be in the hands
of God completely.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:36.130
It is his love only, which kills this body.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:51.159
And when the songs of their strength and victory
is sung, you have seen it, all my chakras

00:21:51.159 --> 00:21:58.440
- how they start working and vibrating because
the strength of those victorious days is still

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:05.510
lingering on and it is going to work through
you.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:18.390
But what about your core [poor?] instrument
which is moving little slowly.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:33.750
The time when love has to rule, the Satyayuga,
if it has to come it is going to be through

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.560
your efforts, now.

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:40.090
Before Sahaja Yoga, no efforts.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:46.450
But now, all your efforts are divine.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:50.169
Whatever you do, whatever sympathetic you
activate, you are getting it through parasympathetic

00:22:50.169 --> 00:22:56.060
- you don't do anything at all.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:11.059
But you can see yourself what sticks, and
watch.

00:23:11.059 --> 00:23:16.140
You are the chosen ones, otherwise why is
it that you are the only people who got this

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.460
realization and so much you have come forward?

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.600
Some of you got it only few days back and
have gone very far.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.600
Why?

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:34.300
You are the chosen ones and you have to take
it upon yourself to be the channels of that

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:46.690
divine love, that dynamic power, which is
going to transform the whole conception of

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:52.720
hatred on which all these nations and all
these differences are created.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.750
It looks sometimes - how?

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:02.790
How can it be?

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:05.940
But now the days are gone - of Gokul.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.370
I was thinking of it.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:16.850
Of the time when Krishna used to play His
flute and He tried His Sahaja Yoga on the

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.131
Gopis and the Gopas.

00:24:19.131 --> 00:24:20.131
Oh!

00:24:20.131 --> 00:24:22.660
We tried and tried and tried, in different
lives.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.760
Nothing worked.

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:35.410
And now it is going to click like a spark.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:37.940
The chain reaction will start.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:42.931
But we have to have strong machines to carry
that.

00:24:42.931 --> 00:24:44.390
Otherwise the fuse will be off.

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:51.530
Only the strength that is in you is to be
felt by your attention.

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:55.800
That's the only thing you have to do - is
to feel your attention and give up all that

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.920
is falsehood.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:01.250
All that is falsehood - you see within yourself
and you will know what is falsehood and you

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:02.830
just drop it [not clear].

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:11.860
Accept only the truth, and the truth will
give you that power to be the real instrument,

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:26.280
to carry this channel, that force of love.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:37.740
It should not mean that you have to be egoistic
- you cannot be even if you try to.

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.990
You cannot harm anyone even if you want to
trouble.

00:25:40.990 --> 00:25:45.750
So many of you have expressed that, "Mataji
you are giving it to every Dick, Tom and Harry."

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:50.170
I can't give it to Dick, Tom and Harry - it
has to be a man who has been searching, it

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:53.270
has to be a woman who has been searching in
their previous lives.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:57.820
You should know that whatever you have got
it, you have got it in your own right.

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:05.990
So, a person may look like a Dick, Tom and
Harry, but he is not.

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:08.340
He is a great saint.

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.620
They are all saints sitting here.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:16.640
It's a center and nucleus of saintliness where
the complete divine is flowing.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:26.430
Only thing is, let 
it flow out from you.

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:32.640
This power is that of God and it is not your
responsibility to worry as to whether it will

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.059
do good or bad.

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:40.890
Even if you think that it may do some bad
things according to the moral sciences of

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:45.640
this world, ultimately it is going to be all
right.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.960
Why that Jarasandha was to be killed?

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.230
Why that Kansa was to be killed?

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:52.370
Why Ravana was to be killed?

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:58.549
Of course, killing doesn't help much that
I have realized.

00:26:58.549 --> 00:27:09.299
Because, all those who were killed are back
again in their saddles . But still, you don't

00:27:09.299 --> 00:27:16.620
fight those horrible people.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:22.740
You just fight your self out.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:24.299
You just watch yourself.

00:27:24.299 --> 00:27:25.720
Where are you?

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.620
What are you doing?

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:35.370
Are you on the divine or on the gross?

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:43.630
Just think about it every moment, every moment
you are in meditation just think of the moment

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:46.690
and the dynamism of that moment.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:51.799
The complete power that is feeding [?] every
moment just to go inside you.

00:27:51.799 --> 00:27:58.380
It will flow through your Sahastrar inside
your being and completely revolve around your

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:06.720
whole being and transform the inside into
a complete Chaitanya Shakti, a complete divine

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.970
power.

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:12.870
Allow it to come in, accept it.

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:16.180
Accept it without any fear.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:22.660
Let it get in.

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:25.679
Every moment, every moment keep awake.

00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:31.290
It's a very precarious time that we are up
to.

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:36.410
I have only two hands you can see that very
clearly.

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:43.600
And though Mr. --------- says that I can do
everything, I can do everything but not to

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.870
make you do something.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:54.070
Your will, will be respected throughout.

00:28:54.070 --> 00:29:03.250
Every other thing can be looked after except
for one - that you should be a perfect machine,

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:17.140
a perfect channel, a perfect flute for my
lord to play that tune of love.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:29.540
It is for you to clear out all your seven
holes.

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:37.270
It is for you to clear out your hollowness
and to be complete within yourself and He

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:40.000
knows his job.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.720
He is the artist.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.540
But you are the instruments.

00:29:49.540 --> 00:30:01.100
And the harmonious music from so many souls
can fill the ears of these evil people and

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:08.390
can penetrate into their heart and put love
into them and may be that they themselves

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:18.370
will give up their evil ways and fall at the
feet of love.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:30.230
Krishna is to be born within you today.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:39.260
A five-year-old boy went to kill Kalia.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:44.220
That Krishna is to born within you.

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:54.150
Went and sat on the Kalia's Sahastrar and
was pressing with His feet and all the people

00:30:54.150 --> 00:31:04.179
were seeing this great drama of Krishna's
dancing on the Kalia's Sahastrara.

00:31:04.179 --> 00:31:15.809
Krishna is to be born within your being.

00:31:15.809 --> 00:31:27.020
When you are Krishna, you are not going to
see me.

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:55.419
Let us now go to the state, which is beyond
words, beyond thoughts, into the realm of

00:31:55.419 --> 00:32:03.290
thoughtless awareness where the divine is
pouring its blessings.

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:17.460
These people have decided today to have a
Puja, and you know what happens to Me when

00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.559
you do My Puja.

00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:34.420
So with all those problems that will be facing
later, I would like all of you to be attentive

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:39.960
about the Puja and to take full advantage
of that.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:45.560
With this Puja you get the Mother's protection,
to begin with.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:46.590
And My Chakras, when they start moving, they
give you special powers of love and bless

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:47.590
all your Chakras and fill them up completely.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:56.100
So I would like you, though some two people
are coming to do this, all of you to feel

00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:09.020
that you all are doing it - and you can feel
it that way with oneness.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:17.570
And the blessings of My being will flow to
you automatically.
