00:00:01.217 --> 00:00:10.716
Today, you all have decided to celebrate My seventy-eighth birthday.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.526
You have put beautiful balloons as you would put for a child

00:00:28.864 --> 00:00:36.754
on his birthday with such loving hands.

00:00:45.118 --> 00:00:54.389
Yesterday, as I told you, you have to find out about yourself.

00:00:55.536 --> 00:01:04.864
 Just try to find out also as you love Me, how much you can love others.

00:01:07.462 --> 00:01:19.764
 It will be much easier to find out through introspection

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:30.710
how much you love others and how much you care for others.

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:40.508
 If that happens, many problems of Sahaja Yoga will be solved in no time.

00:01:42.437 --> 00:01:50.472
Even in Sahaja Yoga what I am told that people still are hankering after money.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.170
They think it's a place where they can make some money.

00:01:54.863 --> 00:02:02.651
I am surprised. This is not the area where you can really work out that.

00:02:03.565 --> 00:02:06.202
You will be exposed in no time.

00:02:06.678 --> 00:02:15.909
 On the contrary, if you people are worried about your powers in Sahaja Yoga

00:02:16.564 --> 00:02:20.807
as leaders and deputy leaders, and I don't know what all,

00:02:21.225 --> 00:02:24.772
 then also you are sadly mistaken.

00:02:25.614 --> 00:02:27.370
That's not the place.

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:30.667
 For that you can join politics,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.404
 or else for making money you can go to race courses or some place.

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:43.654
If you are coming to Sahaja Yoga, what you have to get is a ocean of love

00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:50.511
 within your heart and to seek that in others also.

00:02:51.315 --> 00:03:01.522
It's a love which helps you to do everything so smoothly, so beautifully.

00:03:04.915 --> 00:03:10.453
 As I have always said that if you really love your country,

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:19.476
you can never be dishonest.
You will have no other interest but to get

00:03:19.794 --> 00:03:24.127
your freedom or whatever you want to do for your country.

00:03:25.511 --> 00:03:29.301
In this country, we have had great martyrs.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.486
Perhaps you may not be knowing, some of you.

00:03:34.926 --> 00:03:41.282
And the way they sustained the torturous life,

00:03:41.433 --> 00:03:45.647
it was only because they loved their country.

00:03:46.972 --> 00:03:50.212
Your country is spirituality.

00:03:51.737 --> 00:04:01.569
It is the country of complete enjoyment of yourself.

00:04:02.387 --> 00:04:07.402
It's the country where nothing but peace prevails.

00:04:07.642 --> 00:04:15.140
And, when you love that country, how can you have all these nonsensical ideas

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:22.855
 for money and for power and all that? I just can't understand.

00:04:25.725 --> 00:04:33.869
I, as it is you know very well, that I'm not bothered about these things at all in my life.

00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:40.998
Of course, we need money for work, for everything.

00:04:41.213 --> 00:04:47.511
But there's no need to run after it or hanker after it.

00:04:48.297 --> 00:04:52.233
I am surprised even after so many years of My hard work,

00:04:52.848 --> 00:04:59.692
 there are some people still working out some stupid stuffs

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:06.466
which I can't understand. And, they should know they'll be exposed in no time.

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:12.949
 This is the year of exposure I told last time. Absolutely!

00:05:13.163 --> 00:05:21.132
If you have no love for Sahaja Yoga,
if you have no love for your Mother,

00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:24.409
you will run after those nonsensical things

00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:29.873
and make some mess out of yourself.
If you want to destroy yourself,

00:05:30.085 --> 00:05:34.535
you can go to some other fields, but not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:34.654 --> 00:05:41.580
In Sahaja Yoga, you have to know you have to be really dedicated and honest.

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:46.660
 You should enjoy your honesty, you should enjoy your love,

00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:50.734
you should enjoy your generosity, everything.

00:05:52.488 --> 00:05:56.638
You will be exposed, no doubt. But then where will you go?

00:05:56.829 --> 00:05:58.828
What will be your position?

00:05:59.214 --> 00:06:06.609
 If you are doing all those things,
you have to go the way people have gone to hell, I should say.

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:10.450
 Because after coming to the paradise of love,

00:06:10.625 --> 00:06:14.077
 if you are still bothered about these nonsensical things,

00:06:14.348 --> 00:06:20.089
then you will jump very fast into the hell. I can see that clearly.

00:06:20.369 --> 00:06:25.970
I shouldn't say this on My birthday, but this is the year of exposure.

00:06:26.256 --> 00:06:28.639
And be very careful!

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.748
Nobody will be spared this year. What to do? Though it's My birthday,

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:39.386
I have to tell you, it won't keep quiet.

00:06:39.856 --> 00:06:42.966
You know there are certain powers which flow.

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:51.323
And different, different years I find a different type of powers start flowing,

00:06:51.752 --> 00:06:57.932
 and this is the time when power for exposure is going to be there.

00:06:58.807 --> 00:07:06.211
 Whether you are a leader or if you are not, if you are making anything dishonest,

00:07:06.552 --> 00:07:11.797
you will be exposed and you will be rightly punished.

00:07:12.464 --> 00:07:15.035
Sahaja Yoga may not punish you,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.803
but there are so many ways that this power works out.

00:07:21.548 --> 00:07:26.037
The first thing is what we call "alakshmi."

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:32.422
Alakshmi means at that time when you are punished,

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:38.349
you will be surprised, you will just become bankrupt. You will have no money.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.899
You will be exposed. You may be in jail.

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:48.717
So, though it's a very auspicious day, I must tell you not to be inauspicious.

00:07:49.527 --> 00:07:53.896
Yesterday's lecture I explained to you: know what your powers are -

00:07:54.254 --> 00:08:02.086
 what you can enjoy, what you can give, what can work out.

00:08:02.528 --> 00:08:07.482
But firstly, you must know are you capable of doing that

00:08:07.544 --> 00:08:12.350
 or you are just working it out in the other way around.

00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:22.315
 I was amazed to hear that after so many years also people have not given up this kind of a

00:08:23.474 --> 00:08:27.789
temptations that they have and they had.

00:08:30.554 --> 00:08:37.878
On Birthday, you must remember how many years you have spent doing Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:39.166 --> 00:08:44.109
You must understand all the nice time you had

00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:50.490
and how many every year you have spent in enjoying My Birthday -

00:08:50.649 --> 00:08:57.199
 also, in understanding how you have grown into it, how you changed it, and

00:08:57.358 --> 00:09:05.761
how you enjoyed and how you have imbibed all the qualities of Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:06.634 --> 00:09:16.249
First and foremost quality of a Sahaja Yogi, that he has to be absolutely honest.

00:09:17.081 --> 00:09:22.147
He has not come here to make money. Not money!

00:09:22.426 --> 00:09:26.088
He has not come here to make a power.

00:09:26.403 --> 00:09:34.682
But he has come to rise into the new beautiful world that we are creating.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:37.642
 We have to create this world for the

00:09:37.818 --> 00:09:45.193
whole world, for people who live all over, who are even in the jungles,

00:09:45.399 --> 00:09:52.987
who are lost into Himalayas, anywhere

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:58.897
we have to spread this beautiful sensation,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:06.853
 or beautiful existence of self-respect and dignity.

00:10:08.467 --> 00:10:14.680
Very important is to see if you are really the self.

00:10:14.913 --> 00:10:18.040
Are you respecting yourself?

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:22.165
Yesterday only you said "Know Thyself."

00:10:22.808 --> 00:10:26.919
If that is the case, do you respect yourself?

00:10:27.424 --> 00:10:31.333
Very important is first to respect yourself.

00:10:31.786 --> 00:10:34.217
If you don't know how to respect yourself

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:39.150
and you run after useless things, then what should we say?

00:10:40.404 --> 00:10:45.609
What is the quality that you have imbibed in Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:45.696 --> 00:10:50.513
 except that you have started a business or something like that?

00:10:51.304 --> 00:11:04.189
 It is very sad but there are people 
who are still ruined in the mud of all these things.

00:11:05.623 --> 00:11:08.462
You have overcome so many things I know,

00:11:08.621 --> 00:11:13.502
you have achieved so many things I know which is not possible.

00:11:13.803 --> 00:11:20.192
 Humanly impossible things you have done - you have got over all this nonsense.

00:11:20.309 --> 00:11:24.034
 But still there are some people among you

00:11:24.129 --> 00:11:30.216
who still are in the stinking mud of nonsense.

00:11:33.756 --> 00:11:41.413
It is nice that you are celebrating My Birthday 
with such enthusiasm and such happiness.

00:11:41.691 --> 00:11:44.276
So nice to see all this.

00:11:44.459 --> 00:11:49.059
And, I want you all to be My decorations.

00:11:49.305 --> 00:11:53.410
In the whole world they should see that you are My children,

00:11:53.624 --> 00:11:59.304
 and that you are of such great values and such great understanding.

00:12:01.094 --> 00:12:04.852
You are My children.

00:12:05.717 --> 00:12:14.311
I have really worked for you in the sense every minute, moment of My life.

00:12:14.676 --> 00:12:21.734
 I have thought of you. I wanted to work it out in such a beautiful manner

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:31.387
 that you become really good people, ideal people, special people with understanding.

00:12:32.145 --> 00:12:39.145
So, that is the day you should feel that your birthday is being celebrated.

00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:45.394
When you are completely cleared out, you have become Nirmal,

00:12:45.984 --> 00:12:54.418
absolutely pure personality of love, 
that's the day is your birthday and Mine too.

00:12:55.778 --> 00:12:57.871
I have to tell about these things

00:12:57.959 --> 00:13:01.578
because some things have come to My notice and I am really shocked

00:13:01.649 --> 00:13:09.085
 the way some people are still not understanding their value, 
not understanding their worth.

00:13:09.152 --> 00:13:17.275
 And, that's what other day I told you that you must know about yourself.

00:13:17.648 --> 00:13:21.495
First of all, the self is the spirit.

00:13:22.194 --> 00:13:25.602
 It's the spirit the reflection of God Almighty.

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.880
If you want to live like all other ordinary nonsensical people,

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.388
you should stay out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:40.716
But if you think that you have to really show your worth coming into Sahaja Yoga

00:13:40.818 --> 00:13:44.546
 and if you have to feel proud of yourself,

00:13:44.674 --> 00:13:51.718
then try to understand that in Sahaja Yoga
you don't have to have all these weaknesses.

00:13:52.575 --> 00:14:00.786
 When the Kundalini rises, she passes through 
the six chakras by enlightening them.

00:14:01.611 --> 00:14:08.212
 I may tolerate you up to a point but the Kundalini

00:14:09.077 --> 00:14:12.733
will punish you. She will do what is needed to correct you.

00:14:12.853 --> 00:14:15.368
 Up to a point, She will do.

00:14:15.454 --> 00:14:24.307
And, afterwards, when She finds it is not possible to correct you,

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.734
then I don't know what will happen and how it will work out.

00:14:30.029 --> 00:14:36.694
Sahaja Yoga is very easy to come in, to move in and to work it out.

00:14:36.863 --> 00:14:40.223
But you go against yourself.

00:14:40.533 --> 00:14:46.279
 If you try to behave like very ordinary, useless people

00:14:46.451 --> 00:14:51.631
then you cannot stay in Sahaja Yoga.  You'll be thrown out.

00:14:51.945 --> 00:14:56.313
 As soon as you are thrown out, where will you land,

00:14:56.406 --> 00:15:00.604
 what will happen that you know very well.

00:15:04.447 --> 00:15:10.572
On this auspicious day, I have to request you to be auspicious.

00:15:11.128 --> 00:15:14.898
Not to do anything that is inauspicious.

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:21.161
They call it protocol. But there are small, small things

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.843
which shows you are auspicious.

00:15:25.042 --> 00:15:29.871
Very, very minute subtle things that shows

00:15:29.943 --> 00:15:33.816
you're auspicious, which you don't have to learn.

00:15:34.291 --> 00:15:43.016
 Automatically, spontaneously it comes and you enjoy your auspiciousness

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:49.836
because you are holy, because you are Nirmal

00:15:50.066 --> 00:15:54.806
 and you enjoy that quality within you.

00:15:55.475 --> 00:15:59.725
And, when that happens, that is your birthday.

00:16:00.401 --> 00:16:05.131
You were reborn as you know. All of you were reborn.

00:16:05.282 --> 00:16:10.477
You were reborn but still you were children and now you have grown up.

00:16:10.866 --> 00:16:16.999
 That growth has to be shown in every way.

00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:25.034
When a person grows, then he goes all out to do various things,

00:16:25.119 --> 00:16:31.237
to express himself. In the same way, when you are grown up,

00:16:31.661 --> 00:16:37.291
 then you have to show that you are grown up in Sahaja Yoga,

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:43.130
 that you are very deep and you are very senior person.

00:16:43.358 --> 00:16:46.008
I have seen some little children also.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:52.068
They are so grown up and so sensible that sometimes I am amazed.

00:16:52.174 --> 00:16:54.773
 They are great saints reborn.

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:58.402
 They are great people who are reborn.

00:16:58.505 --> 00:17:03.176
But if you are still running after nonsensical things,

00:17:03.311 --> 00:17:07.539
 if you are still full of lust and greed,

00:17:08.047 --> 00:17:11.139
then better you leave Sahaja Yoga up to itself

00:17:11.249 --> 00:17:16.547
 and you can find some other area where you can do that.

00:17:17.617 --> 00:17:27.007
It is something surprising how people do not understand
 their position in Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:30.087 --> 00:17:35.400
Your growth has been on the whole very good.

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:40.334
I know there are many people who are wonderful Sahaja Yogis,

00:17:40.461 --> 00:17:47.164
 who are really great Sahaja Yogis and they have every right to call themselves

00:17:47.387 --> 00:17:50.306
Sahaja Yogis or Mahayogis.

00:17:51.251 --> 00:17:55.292
But that is only possible and perceptible

00:17:55.610 --> 00:18:03.440
if you really grow up inside

00:18:03.639 --> 00:18:12.246
and your spirit shines like crystal clear ocean of love.

00:18:20.067 --> 00:18:23.133
Now, the connection has been done.

00:18:23.674 --> 00:18:27.120
You have the knowledge of all the chakras.

00:18:27.472 --> 00:18:31.182
You know how to raise Kundalini.

00:18:31.596 --> 00:18:36.413
You know also how to cure people and how to treat people.

00:18:37.346 --> 00:18:45.466
With all that knowledge, with all that life you have got,

00:18:46.239 --> 00:18:54.323
it's like the milk you give to your energies

00:18:54.696 --> 00:18:59.043
and then you have to become energetic.

00:18:59.705 --> 00:19:02.890
You cannot be lethargic about it.

00:19:03.683 --> 00:19:08.584
When you are lethargic, then you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:19:09.279 --> 00:19:15.458
You have to be moving with this flame in your heart

00:19:15.677 --> 00:19:24.324
that you know what is self is and you know what you have to do for others.

00:19:24.777 --> 00:19:30.316
Must be, you must have been also great seekers in previous lives,

00:19:30.674 --> 00:19:37.067
 and that seeking that was there has brought you to Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:38.035 --> 00:19:43.850
 Now, with that seeking when you are here,
 still you are seeking all these useless things.

00:19:43.994 --> 00:19:46.842
They cannot grow, you cannot grow.

00:19:46.958 --> 00:19:51.339
And such people cannot make others also grow.

00:19:53.506 --> 00:19:56.984
So, the main thing one has to understand,

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.103
how you have grown in your love.

00:20:01.294 --> 00:20:08.654
You see, a person who is frightful, who is very strict,

00:20:09.192 --> 00:20:15.669
who talks very rudely, is not a Sahaja Yogi, no way.

00:20:16.037 --> 00:20:23.258
But the one who looks after, cares, loves

00:20:23.553 --> 00:20:28.963
and is very generous, is the real Sahaja Yogi.

00:20:29.439 --> 00:20:32.237
 You are people of special qualities

00:20:32.559 --> 00:20:37.469
 and those qualities must be shown in your life.

00:20:38.056 --> 00:20:44.196
I know you love Me very much. And you know what you have done to celebrate My birthday.

00:20:44.689 --> 00:20:49.168
As you have so many of these decorations,

00:20:49.399 --> 00:20:53.553
I have already told you that you are My decorations.

00:20:54.085 --> 00:20:56.924
And, your lives are My decorations,

00:20:57.345 --> 00:21:04.619
and the way you behave and the way you know yourself

00:21:05.026 --> 00:21:12.026
- things will be so much appreciated all over the world.

00:21:12.596 --> 00:21:19.715
It is not for any other purpose but only to remember

00:21:20.031 --> 00:21:23.534
 that you all have to grow.

00:21:23.947 --> 00:21:30.169
 You have to become very, very deep personalities.

00:21:30.423 --> 00:21:37.845
You have to grow within yourself celebrating your own birthday.

00:21:37.997 --> 00:21:43.717
Everyday try to see, what is your experience?

00:21:44.104 --> 00:21:49.517
What did you see? Whom did you meet? How did they talk?

00:21:49.679 --> 00:21:52.840
 I mean I know so many names.

00:21:53.031 --> 00:21:55.467
Practically, everybody's name I know.

00:21:55.651 --> 00:21:58.702
Practically, everybody's Kundalini I know.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:04.901
 I also know whose Kundalini is all right, whose is not. I know so many people.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:09.466
So many ask Me, "How do You know so many names and how do You remember that?"

00:22:09.641 --> 00:22:16.577
I say, "I don't know that part", but it is that whenever I see a person,

00:22:16.673 --> 00:22:23.019
I see his Kundalini and from that Kundalini I know who he is.

00:22:23.479 --> 00:22:27.119
 There can be thousands and thousands of Kundalinis,

00:22:27.209 --> 00:22:33.475
but I know who is who because I love them.

00:22:33.677 --> 00:22:38.053
If you love somebody, then you know what he is.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:42.415
It's not stupid love, as they call it romance and all that.

00:22:42.566 --> 00:22:45.363
 It's very deep feeling.

00:22:45.681 --> 00:22:50.637
When you enter like into the garden of your heart

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:55.540
and you feel the beautiful fragrance all around -

00:22:55.715 --> 00:23:02.197
when you think of such nice people as there have been as saints,

00:23:02.383 --> 00:23:07.067
 great saviors and now the Sahaja Yogis -

00:23:07.398 --> 00:23:19.700
you feel so much grateful that you have achieved 
that state of collective enjoyment.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.666
I have never put any restrictions on you. Do what you like,

00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:29.386
whatever way you want to do it, you can do it. I have never been bothering

00:23:29.499 --> 00:23:37.566
you about money or anything. But that is a testing ground.

00:23:38.153 --> 00:23:43.216
 That is the testing ground where you are standing.

00:23:43.622 --> 00:23:48.968
If you do not test yourself, how will you know how far you have come?

00:23:49.231 --> 00:23:55.804
So, you are the student, you are the examiner,

00:23:56.015 --> 00:24:00.364
 and you are the one who has to give yourself certificate.

00:24:00.642 --> 00:24:07.306
And, in that case what happens is that you start understanding,

00:24:07.588 --> 00:24:13.231
 understanding so many things which you have never understood.

00:24:14.797 --> 00:24:18.876
I mean, the knowledge, so called knowledge,

00:24:19.027 --> 00:24:23.720
 is no knowledge because it's all falsehood, it's all mental.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:30.463
But the real absolute knowledge dawns upon you about everyone,

00:24:30.765 --> 00:24:41.285
 about every aspect, about every surrounding 
that you have, so clearly you know.

00:24:41.934 --> 00:24:50.143
 And, that should happen that you should know very clearly -

00:24:50.444 --> 00:24:58.184
 very, very clearly - what is the situation with you,

00:24:58.477 --> 00:25:03.047
 where are you and what are you doing.

00:25:03.465 --> 00:25:09.746
Not that you have any less powers. You have all the powers,

00:25:09.929 --> 00:25:13.425
but for that you have to go deep down.

00:25:13.537 --> 00:25:18.406
Like there's a well, the well has water in it,

00:25:18.523 --> 00:25:25.523
but if your bucket doesn't go down, how can it bring the water?

00:25:26.001 --> 00:25:34.348
If your bucket is filled with stones, what's the use of that well to you?

00:25:34.662 --> 00:25:41.046
 In the same way, we have everything within us, as I told you yesterday,

00:25:41.428 --> 00:25:49.904
and Sahaja Yoga is the way you can go down and find about yourself

00:25:50.056 --> 00:25:56.839
which is so beautiful, clean - and that's the thing to be enjoyed.

00:25:57.006 --> 00:26:01.593
 Not other nonsensical things after which you are running,

00:26:01.728 --> 00:26:04.383
 which you think is important.

00:26:04.517 --> 00:26:10.486
I have already told you: it is "Shudh Ichchaa" is the Kundalini - Shudh Ichchaa,

00:26:10.697 --> 00:26:16.189
pure desire because other desires are never fulfilled.

00:26:16.499 --> 00:26:22.220
You try to buy one thing, then you don't enjoy.

00:26:22.351 --> 00:26:27.136
You want to buy another one, you don't enjoy. 
You want to buy another one, you don't enjoy.

00:26:27.231 --> 00:26:30.603
So, because it's not the real desire.

00:26:30.707 --> 00:26:35.603
This is the principle of economics that you are never satisfied.

00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:39.110
You go on buying, buying, buying, buying, buying, buying.

00:26:39.251 --> 00:26:42.345
And you buy so many things ultimately

00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:46.496
what happens is that all the industries collapse.

00:26:46.995 --> 00:26:50.040
That's what is happening in America.

00:26:50.271 --> 00:27:00.469
It has a quality that whatever you do repels back on you.

00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:06.160
Only the spiritual growth does not repel.

00:27:06.827 --> 00:27:11.619
 It flowers, it's fragrant, it's beautiful -

00:27:11.722 --> 00:27:15.972
such a beautiful experience to be with yourself,

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:22.748
as if you have entered into the beautiful garden of paradise.

00:27:24.438 --> 00:27:29.615
 If that feeling if you want to have, give up all nonsensical ideas.

00:27:29.853 --> 00:27:32.141
Give up all worldly nonsense.

00:27:32.424 --> 00:27:38.511
 Everything you give up, and then you will feel that you are now

00:27:38.662 --> 00:27:43.508
very much there where you should have been.

00:27:44.338 --> 00:27:49.302
 You will have no doubts. You will have no hankerings.

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:53.733
You will not feel at all in any way dissatisfied.

00:27:54.333 --> 00:28:03.647
 But some people are still at a very elementary stage, I know.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:10.809
I know I have not told them because 
I know this is the year they'll be all exposed. No doubt!

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:21.449
Then, what is the use of doing something  in which you will be exposed

00:28:21.774 --> 00:28:28.988
and that the whole world of Sahaja Yoga  will look at you as a criminal?

00:28:29.284 --> 00:28:34.766
 Or as person who doesn't need any respect whatsoever.

00:28:36.568 --> 00:28:45.575
Either you get out of it - and if you are here to gain lots of

00:28:48.743 --> 00:28:59.169
 ascending steps, you have to have your eyes upward and not downward.

00:28:59.387 --> 00:29:02.371
 You must see what steps there are.

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:08.148
You have to climb up those steps. With these steps where do you enter? I tell you,

00:29:08.263 --> 00:29:17.593
 in that beautiful garden - fragrant, garden of yourself,  which is so beautiful.

00:29:18.154 --> 00:29:21.694
Instead of that, you are lost in the maya

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:28.503
 of the world as so many are lost. So, why have you come to Sahaja Yoga?

00:29:29.849 --> 00:29:33.195
Give up those nonsensical ideas.

00:29:33.489 --> 00:29:39.042
Try to take to spirituality. Pure spirituality.

00:29:39.523 --> 00:29:45.419
"Purity" is the world. Purity you must have.

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:55.048
And, purity within is you can easily, easily establish with Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:55.834 --> 00:30:04.476
 Your witness state has to improve. 
Witness state has to be projected so much

00:30:04.801 --> 00:30:12.046
 that this conditioning and ego of reaction will finish up.

00:30:12.367 --> 00:30:16.776
You will have no more reactions, but you will just witness.

00:30:16.927 --> 00:30:24.115
And, the knowledge that is real comes always,  to always through witnessing.

00:30:24.931 --> 00:30:29.744
If you do not know howwitness, then whatever knowledge you have is nothing

00:30:29.847 --> 00:30:36.810
 but through your ego or through your, you can say, conditionings.

00:30:37.131 --> 00:30:39.296
 It's not absolute knowledge.

00:30:39.883 --> 00:30:43.790
So, to get the absolute knowledge about anything,

00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:48.761
what you have to do is to reach the point of absoluteness -

00:30:49.268 --> 00:30:59.145
 to reach the point where you are absolutely clean, pure, Nirmal.

00:31:00.445 --> 00:31:04.724
Now, don't condemn yourself if you have some defects.

00:31:05.161 --> 00:31:07.907
There has to be. You are all human beings.

00:31:08.061 --> 00:31:17.806
But all this defects with your power of spirituality you can absolutely overcome.

00:31:18.538 --> 00:31:21.287
For that, what have you to do?

00:31:21.484 --> 00:31:26.835
First is introspection. First is trying to find out.

00:31:27.113 --> 00:31:29.673
You separate yourself with yourself

00:31:29.833 --> 00:31:34.986
and say, "Hello Mister, how are you?" Start with that.

00:31:35.586 --> 00:31:38.806
"Hello, what are you up to?"

00:31:39.403 --> 00:31:43.417
And, you start seeing yourself outside

00:31:44.275 --> 00:31:51.682
and eradicating, removing all that is not yourself.

00:31:52.423 --> 00:31:59.423
That knowledge of self comes to you when you want the knowledge.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:05.301
 It should be pure desire to know about the self.

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:13.272
 You are special people, no doubt. 
You are all chosen to be very, very special, no doubt.

00:32:13.391 --> 00:32:18.456
 There must be something about you that you have come to this state

00:32:18.515 --> 00:32:24.810
where you are trying to become the self.

00:32:25.564 --> 00:32:29.725
Self is absolutely self-satisfied.

00:32:30.936 --> 00:32:34.076
It does not need anything to satisfy itself.

00:32:34.235 --> 00:32:37.774
Actually, it is satisfaction personified.

00:32:38.372 --> 00:32:47.538
 It just sees things, it just watches things, it just witnesses.

00:32:47.764 --> 00:32:55.073
 And while witnessing anything, it knows. It knows.

00:32:55.438 --> 00:32:59.546
 You don't have to tell: this is this or this is what.

00:32:59.689 --> 00:33:02.459
You don't have to express too much anything.

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:10.293
 It's just self expressive if, if you are a clean person,

00:33:10.934 --> 00:33:17.754
your desires are clean and that you just have pure desire to ascend.

00:33:18.311 --> 00:33:22.555
So, again I have to talk about Kundalini that you must have

00:33:22.683 --> 00:33:30.862
 a Kundalini completely establishing itself within you.

00:33:32.454 --> 00:33:36.605
 Completely expressing within you.

00:33:36.918 --> 00:33:41.950
Completely enlightening, enlightening your self.

00:33:42.327 --> 00:33:50.411
Such a Kundalini should be there, 
and only possible if you do not put hurdles in her growth.

00:33:51.379 --> 00:33:56.044
 If you allow it to grow, it grows and it works out.

00:33:57.297 --> 00:34:01.775
As you know, I have started this work only in 1970.

00:34:02.045 --> 00:34:05.566
Not because I could not start it earlier,

00:34:05.947 --> 00:34:10.919
not because there were all bad people in this world,

00:34:11.103 --> 00:34:22.256
but because I was waiting Myself to be deft in dealing with all kinds of Kundalinis.

00:34:22.916 --> 00:34:29.018
 I had to work out all the permutations and combinations that were there.

00:34:29.209 --> 00:34:37.143
And, then I just thought if I could get hold of a way by which

00:34:37.436 --> 00:34:42.886
 all these combinations can be worked out in one line,

00:34:43.495 --> 00:34:48.463
then only Kundalini will rise. And it worked, it happened

00:34:48.836 --> 00:34:55.011
 with a sincere desire! Because I felt very sad about people

00:34:55.530 --> 00:35:01.431
who are spending their lives in something very nonsensical.

00:35:01.551 --> 00:35:06.920
They cannot enjoy anything, they have no genuine feeling for anything,

00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:13.397
 they have no genuine love for anything, and they are not even loved.

00:35:13.675 --> 00:35:18.878
 They cannot love, they are not loved and they are in misery.

00:35:20.172 --> 00:35:27.791
So, it was very deliberate action on My part, I should say,

00:35:28.014 --> 00:35:30.844
 that I watched human beings very carefully.

00:35:31.874 --> 00:35:35.739
 Why they do it like this? Why they behave like this?

00:35:35.882 --> 00:35:39.768
Why are they not understanding? Why are they harsh?

00:35:40.064 --> 00:35:45.510
 Why they shout? Why they beat? Why they do all these things?

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.104
 Because of imbalances within.

00:35:50.136 --> 00:35:54.950
 But with introspection if you start seeing those imbalances,

00:35:55.070 --> 00:36:01.217
 you now know how to cure yourself and you can really work it out.

00:36:01.336 --> 00:36:04.565
You have to just work on your chakras.

00:36:04.955 --> 00:36:08.901
See which chakra is catching, where is the problem.

00:36:09.305 --> 00:36:18.575
 You have to respect yourself in such a way that 
you become your own doctor.

00:36:18.946 --> 00:36:22.199
And, you know everything about yourself.

00:36:22.316 --> 00:36:26.807
"Ah, this is wrong with me. Why am I catching? 
Why am I catching on that chakra?

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:32.050
 Why this is happening?" This is the education you have to give it to yourself,

00:36:32.098 --> 00:36:39.098
which will be only possible if you experience all those catches.

00:36:40.047 --> 00:36:45.447
It is for you to grow now. Grow into great people,

00:36:45.662 --> 00:36:55.439
 great personalities, very tremendous people 
who have made history, who are respected.

00:36:55.995 --> 00:37:03.749
 All those great saints and all that also were of great caliber

00:37:03.809 --> 00:37:09.170
 but they didn't know how to raise the kundalini, which you know.

00:37:09.491 --> 00:37:14.615
You have something special knowledge how to raise the Kundalini,

00:37:14.813 --> 00:37:24.028
how to judge the Kundalini, how to understand where is the problem.

00:37:24.598 --> 00:37:32.154
 And, also you know how to tell that person about

00:37:33.186 --> 00:37:37.723
his problems, very beautifully with love.

00:37:37.937 --> 00:37:45.985
So, the message of your spirit is that you should love each other.

00:37:47.793 --> 00:37:51.830
 If you do not love someone then what's the matter?

00:37:52.147 --> 00:37:58.868
 Why don't you love? 
What is the bad thing about a particular person?

00:37:59.426 --> 00:38:05.032
 If he is a Sahaja Yogi and a great Sahaja Yogi, is it out of jealousy?

00:38:05.287 --> 00:38:11.954
 Is it out of greed or is it out lust still you are like that?

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:24.738
Then the oneness in the whole world of brotherhood is something to be really enjoyed.

00:38:25.146 --> 00:38:28.595
 Enjoyed so beautifully.

00:38:29.043 --> 00:38:31.688
See all these things you have here.

00:38:31.879 --> 00:38:40.354
There is so much harmony among them. 
So much of harmony because it is done with love!

00:38:40.828 --> 00:38:45.018
 If you do anything with love, it's very harmonious.

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:49.230
 It creates such harmony among people.

00:38:49.546 --> 00:38:58.213
You see, the enjoyment of each other's company, the enjoyment of each other's achievements

00:38:58.867 --> 00:39:08.930
is so much joy giving that I cannot describe it in words. It's impossible.

00:39:09.088 --> 00:39:14.646
Words cannot communicate to you that feeling that you have.

00:39:14.786 --> 00:39:20.204
As I told you, you feel as if you are in the Garden of Eden.

00:39:21.807 --> 00:39:29.009
That sort of a feeling should come into you when you, your self, you know.

00:39:29.296 --> 00:39:36.144
 Because when you know your self, actually you know your own being

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:44.072
 and you are so happy that your self is so beautiful.

00:39:44.561 --> 00:39:52.873
 That you are so beautiful, that you are so joyous, that you have all these things -

00:39:53.487 --> 00:40:02.724
to know that within you is really, really very much fragrant with enjoyment.

00:40:03.448 --> 00:40:09.488
That state you must have. I see sometimes when you are overjoyed you dance and sing

00:40:09.828 --> 00:40:13.121
and do...that's something really very good.

00:40:13.249 --> 00:40:18.280
But all the time your spirit should dance at smallest things,

00:40:19.992 --> 00:40:26.441
 at the little thing that is made, say, something artistic you see,

00:40:26.736 --> 00:40:36.434
something you see a gesture of kindness, a gesture of gratitude.

00:40:36.845 --> 00:40:46.342
You feel that depth of that feeling.

00:40:47.199 --> 00:40:53.124
For example, today I saw the flag. Independence

00:40:53.455 --> 00:40:56.484
when we got, we made this flag.

00:40:56.677 --> 00:41:04.269
 I had seen this flag been brought down 
and put up when the other flag was brought down.

00:41:04.602 --> 00:41:09.076
 I cannot tell you what was the feeling that moment.

00:41:09.726 --> 00:41:17.290
Such a feeling that the truth has somehow or other overcome the untruth.

00:41:17.583 --> 00:41:22.573
 The justice has been shown over the injustice.

00:41:22.957 --> 00:41:28.002
That feeling is still so much, I can't even see the flag.

00:41:28.129 --> 00:41:31.497
 If I see it, I remember the whole history,

00:41:31.725 --> 00:41:37.193
the whole thing - how many people sacrificed, 
how many martyrs there were,

00:41:37.345 --> 00:41:42.975
and how much people have fought for it. That flag stands for that.

00:41:43.944 --> 00:41:50.944
And, you stand for all that. You stand for all those ideals.

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.132
You stand for all those sacrifices.

00:41:55.394 --> 00:42:03.489
 And, you stand for all that is to be achieved for bettering human beings.

00:42:03.863 --> 00:42:09.814
You have to achieve a great deal for others.

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:16.940
You have to work within yourself what you can do for others,

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:24.644
 what you can achieve for others, what is the best way to imbibe

00:42:24.816 --> 00:42:31.816
those qualities within you that you become a absolutely unique personality.

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:35.679
As I told you, there have been many great leaders

00:42:35.774 --> 00:42:41.766
and many great people who are remembered by many people.

00:42:42.329 --> 00:42:46.606
 Now, what you should see what made them so great?

00:42:47.294 --> 00:42:51.357
Why so many years people still remember?

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:55.446
 I have given you the statue of Shivaji Maharaj.

00:42:55.605 --> 00:43:03.721
Now, he was another soul, a great soul who had such principles,

00:43:04.052 --> 00:43:11.941
 and such beautifying life in his language, in his attitude and everything.

00:43:12.267 --> 00:43:15.441
 With all that, he was a very brave person.

00:43:16.156 --> 00:43:23.156
Once you have this, you will not deter from doing anything that is important.

00:43:23.784 --> 00:43:26.481
 You will have no fear of anything.

00:43:26.609 --> 00:43:34.009
You will not go round and round but you will know 
how to find the solution and how to work it out.

00:43:35.125 --> 00:43:41.645
 This will happen to you if you really know yourself,

00:43:41.926 --> 00:43:48.262
you will have such powers of courage.

00:43:48.769 --> 00:43:52.506
 You will not be dare devil, but with wisdom.

00:43:52.874 --> 00:43:56.111
 Courage with wisdom you will have.

00:43:56.994 --> 00:44:05.043
 And, that is what is your self 
which will give you lots of wisdom and lots of courage.

00:44:07.055 --> 00:44:13.727
 It's not a fighting spirit, it's not a violent nature, it's not rude nature,

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:19.592
but it's a very silent beautiful, courageous attitude.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:23.891
There is a story about one Chinese saint.

00:44:29.446 --> 00:44:36.728
That when this Chinese saint was asked by one king

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:45.180
 that he should teach how to fight to his cocks. 
They were having cock fights.

00:44:47.319 --> 00:44:54.319
The Chinese saint said, "All right, bring your cock here. 
I will teach you how to fight."

00:44:55.773 --> 00:45:04.606
And, the Chinese saint must have put some wisdom
 into the head of a cock. Can you imagine?

00:45:05.505 --> 00:45:14.283
And, when they took them for that fight,
 what they found that cock was just standing.

00:45:14.828 --> 00:45:20.299
 It would not attack, it would not retreat, it would just stand.

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:26.607
And, all the cocks ran away from the field

00:45:27.567 --> 00:45:36.378
because in that standing was the power of wisdom and power of courage.

00:45:37.049 --> 00:45:43.490
Courage is silently very powerful.

00:45:45.412 --> 00:45:49.313
You don't have to bomb anybody, don't have to kill anybody,

00:45:49.656 --> 00:45:52.779
but you have to stand up with courage.

00:45:52.882 --> 00:46:01.439
And, that is the another quality which will express,
which is very polite, very sweet.

00:46:02.249 --> 00:46:06.389
 You will be standing with that courage.

00:46:07.112 --> 00:46:10.175
I know so many of you are like that.

00:46:10.642 --> 00:46:17.825
 There's no struggle, there's no fight, just standing with courage

00:46:18.458 --> 00:46:21.453
and doing whatever is right.

00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:29.259
And, that is quite possible because you have 
now the connection with the Almighty.

00:46:29.742 --> 00:46:33.300
 You have the connection with the Paramachaitanya

00:46:33.388 --> 00:46:36.848
and that will work it out, everything.

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:47.125
I'll be very, very happy to say that today
 I'm seeing so many of you are such good Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:47.479 --> 00:46:54.801
 So many of them! And, if you find anyone who is not, please report it to Me.

00:46:55.542 --> 00:46:57.327
Please tell Me.

00:46:57.813 --> 00:47:03.606
 Please find out if there is anyone who is trying to be very oppressive

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:07.960
and who is trying to control everything, who is trying to make money,

00:47:08.037 --> 00:47:11.465
who is trying to have lust and greed being expressed.

00:47:11.762 --> 00:47:20.655
So, once you have really worked out you should know

00:47:20.949 --> 00:47:29.591
this is the area what we call is Dharmayudha.

00:47:31.044 --> 00:47:37.094
Dharmayudha means the war of religion,

00:47:37.444 --> 00:47:40.435
but not the way people are fighting it.

00:47:40.953 --> 00:47:46.096
Our dharmayudha is that we are standing on dharma,

00:47:46.247 --> 00:47:52.657
and dharma means not religion but it is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:47:53.437 --> 00:48:01.934
We are standing on our religion and there's a negativity, we can call it adharma,

00:48:02.837 --> 00:48:07.413
which is fighting so you stand on your dharma.

00:48:07.644 --> 00:48:17.624
Unless and until you are dharmic you cannot have any achievement in Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:19.179 --> 00:48:25.187
I have seen people who are say, abroad,

00:48:25.416 --> 00:48:28.854
 they have funny ideas and they will come and tell me,

00:48:28.977 --> 00:48:33.522
"Mother, see, I have a wife but I'm in love with another woman.

00:48:33.703 --> 00:48:35.199
So, what should I do?"

00:48:35.382 --> 00:48:40.080
I said, "You get out. That's all. Just get out."

00:48:40.492 --> 00:48:43.191
Or he may say, the wife might say

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:47.342
that, "Mother, see, I'm having relations with another man.

00:48:47.477 --> 00:48:49.298
And, what should I do?"

00:48:49.524 --> 00:48:54.303
I said, "You get out. That's all. You get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:54.602 --> 00:48:59.759
You are no good for Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja Yoga is no good for you."

00:49:00.339 --> 00:49:05.704
Is a complete outcast!

00:49:06.546 --> 00:49:11.215
They have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:12.758 --> 00:49:30.356
Also, in India we have problem of dishonesty.

00:49:31.706 --> 00:49:34.465
 They are dishonest people.

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:38.446
 This is our special temperament, I think.

00:49:38.517 --> 00:49:43.840
 We have very corrupt people. India has become so corrupt that

00:49:44.115 --> 00:49:48.716
 I can't believe it. I was here about thirty-five years back,

00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:51.864
we had never heard of corruption.

00:49:52.389 --> 00:49:55.964
Now, they have become so corrupt

00:49:56.282 --> 00:50:03.377
and that's what enters, that also enters into Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:04.219 --> 00:50:08.034
When that enters into Sahaja Yoga,

00:50:08.669 --> 00:50:12.823
they will be just found out

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:16.762
and will be punished not by Me,

00:50:16.816 --> 00:50:20.322
by you, but their own Kundalini.

00:50:25.392 --> 00:50:33.062
So, every country has its own specialty as far as doing something wrong.

00:50:33.468 --> 00:50:36.634
 We are not here to do anything wrong.

00:50:36.857 --> 00:50:42.033
 We are not going to express ourselves as wrong people.

00:50:42.216 --> 00:50:49.006
But we are here to prove that we are perfect, we are wonderful people.

00:50:49.372 --> 00:50:53.682
That is what is the self - that we are perfect.

00:50:54.161 --> 00:51:02.934
 We don't have to go according to what we were.

00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:10.144
It's a new realm we have reached, it's a new area we have reached,

00:51:10.374 --> 00:51:14.813
and let us enjoy that great area.

00:51:15.642 --> 00:51:18.733
I think all of you understand Me

00:51:18.821 --> 00:51:28.388
 that today I am little worried about people 
who are dragging Sahaja Yoga down.

00:51:29.848 --> 00:51:35.809
 And, they should understand that I understand everything.

00:51:36.157 --> 00:51:41.629
And, when they'll be harmed, they should not blame Me for that.

00:51:42.074 --> 00:51:48.474
It is obvious that they are nowhere near Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:49.439 --> 00:51:53.896
 Sahaja Yoga purifies you everyday.

00:51:54.413 --> 00:51:58.973
You see one experience, you see one person,

00:51:59.057 --> 00:52:05.383
you see some events and it purifies you.

00:52:06.816 --> 00:52:08.514
That's the sign.

00:52:08.692 --> 00:52:12.750
Supposing I see somebody - a dishonest man,

00:52:12.887 --> 00:52:20.328
 immediately I start finding "I hope I'm not doing any dishonesty Myself."

00:52:21.852 --> 00:52:28.570
Just imagine that you are the one who is the curator -

00:52:28.638 --> 00:52:32.098
 correcting influence on yourself.

00:52:32.567 --> 00:52:35.273
Where do you stand? Do you stand

00:52:35.455 --> 00:52:41.089
 on the correction point or in getting finished with it?

00:52:41.641 --> 00:52:44.889
Yesterdays lecture everybody liked very much

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.912
but this is the extension of that lecture, I'm telling you.

00:52:49.126 --> 00:52:53.467
That you are very great people. You can save the whole world.

00:52:53.908 --> 00:52:59.735
I must say I never expected all this to happen in My lifetime.

00:53:00.036 --> 00:53:06.145
And it has happened. And, I see you as very great, very great people.

00:53:06.619 --> 00:53:10.248
 Especially ladies have to work it out more

00:53:10.468 --> 00:53:19.382
because I am a woman, and women have a special capacity to love and to bear.

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:25.891
I expect all of you to become beautiful, beautiful Sahaja Yogis.

00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:29.687
And that nothing can convince the whole world

00:53:29.915 --> 00:53:40.561
 but your work, your abilities, and also your power to love.

00:53:43.377 --> 00:53:49.296
So many things I have seen, experienced about you people.

00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:54.143
 When I think about them I really feel very happy.

00:53:54.468 --> 00:53:59.127
I have seen people how they have managed and looked after

00:53:59.365 --> 00:54:04.238
so many things which were difficult, and have worked it out.

00:54:04.499 --> 00:54:07.843
So, now we are in for a new world

00:54:07.931 --> 00:54:14.288
and in that new world, a new race of Sahaja Yogis  have to show their presence.

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:20.471
 They have to show their powers and their courage and their understanding.

00:54:20.667 --> 00:54:28.677
It is not serious. It is not frivolous. But it is joyous.

00:54:29.162 --> 00:54:35.439
 It is just joy that you have to feel about yourself.

00:54:35.622 --> 00:54:41.708
 I am telling you all this 
because this is within you,  within your power.

00:54:41.814 --> 00:54:48.317
 It is all the time residing within you and that you have faced it also.

00:54:48.792 --> 00:54:53.293
So, I wish you all a very, very happy birthday

00:54:53.400 --> 00:55:03.841
 so that you people have a new birth 
and new understanding and a new personality.

00:55:04.268 --> 00:55:08.087
 Try to accept that personality, try to respect it.

00:55:08.313 --> 00:55:11.523
That's the personality is your self.

00:55:11.686 --> 00:55:14.499
May God bless you!
