00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.260
Welcome back

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.220
I guess Indian gurus have been involved over recent years in the West, when the Beatles introduced us to the Maharishi.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.390
The orange people blindly followed the bad one, but they have been others far more credible and far more respectful.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.020
My next guest is a Bombay lady

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.220
Who's following is growing around the world.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.920
She says that you have the power to deal positively with every problem from common to cancer.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.120
All you have to do is now have a tap... , tapping that power.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.520
Please welcome the lady acclaimed as India's greatest living Saint,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.560
the Mother of Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji.
Welcome.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.620
I know it's ...Welcome to Australia, I know it's very difficult for you, for anyone to sum up one's religion,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.520
but is it possible to say what is Sahaja Yoga?

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.320
Sahaja- "saha" means "with"," ja" is "born with you".

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.520
This is born with you. Within us is the power

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.020
which can give us the status of a Spirit.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.750
We are not yet the Spirit.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.520
We are at a human level .

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.520
And in the evolutionary process we have to now have the breakthrough to become the Spirit.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.610
That's very essential and is absolutely

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.520
eventually the all possible natural thing that has to happen.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.720
It should happen to all of us and the time has come for you to get to that position where you become the Spirit.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.720
All the religions have talked about it and told about it, but people have gone wrong in believing that

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.720
artificially if you say that you are baptized

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.020
or you have become a Brahmin or you have become a pire that you have become the Spirit.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.620
It's not that.
It's a happening that has to take place within ourselves

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.920
Which is a living process, absolutely a living process of living Divine force within ourselves.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.720
How does this.. we have heard of lots of yogas,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.730
How does this differ from other any yoga?

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.820
Other yoga's were practiced mostly after getting Realization.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.920
But as it has come from some half-baked people,

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.320
it is in a very funny way that people follow it as if they have to take all the medicines together.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.320
And they don't know any discrimination about it.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.520
Unless and until you make this force rise within you, you will not know

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.520
what type of attention is needed

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.820
and what type of physical exercise is needed.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.320
Indiscriminately people do physical exercises getting into trouble.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.320
Now you are speaking of the force. Is it possible to say where this force emanate from?

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.520
This force is a residual power in our triangular bone called as sacrum.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.970
Sacrum

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.320
Now the sacrum is a word that comes from Greece

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.900
and that means Greek people knew this was a sacred bone.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.090
It rises from there, passes through our six centers

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:30.720
piercing through our fontanel bone area and you get the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of your head.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.520
-That's what Christians refer to it?
- Yes. I mean, Holy Ghost.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.320
What is the Holy Ghost? Nobody can explain,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.320
but Holy Ghost is very simple to understand. This is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.320
Holy Ghost is the desire of God.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.520
God Himself watches the working of the desire.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.520
And the desire is that we all should become the Spirit.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.720
And this desire is reflected in our triangular bone, in three and a half coils. When it..

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.820
-Is this the central nervous system?
-No. It is in the triangular bone.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.820
It's this force. This is the forth force within us. You see,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.920
we have sympathetic nervous system, left and right

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.120
and we have got autonomous, that is an autonomous nervous system and parasympathetic

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.120
and we have also central nervous system.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.220
Now this is the system which is not yet working.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.520
It is still in the triangular bone.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.520
When it rises it gives you you a new dimension of the Spirit.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.920
Means the light of the Spirit comes in our attention.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.160
In that case what happens. It's very simple to understand that

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.620
at human level we are not in the absolute state,

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.520
not in the absolute state. That's why there is a chaos.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.820
Supposing I'm holding a snake in my hands, you see, and there's no light.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.020
Somebody tells me that there's a snake. I will not throw it away.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.020
I would not like to listen to anybody's advice about it.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.020
But if there's a light, I'll throw it away.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.620
In the same way when you become the Spirit, the light of the Spirit guides you.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.920
You become your own master, you become your own guru. You don't have to have any guru for that.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.020
This piercing of the fontanel bone by the Kundalini

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.320
gives you the power of the Spirit.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.220
But.. you will demonstrate us or at least will give you a chance to demonstrate

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.320
But you're talking about a physical power of the Spirit that comes out of the top of your head?

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.020
-No, it's an energy.
-An energy, alright.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.820
It's an energy, which comes out of your fontanel bone area, here,

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.120
area, touching the Spirit,
but the Spirit actually resides in the heart.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.820
But the main seat of the heart is here in the fontanel bone area.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.330
And it pierces through, when it pierces through

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.220
actually it should pierce, it is not just I say I baptize you, It's not like that.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.020
It has to pierce through that

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.020
and you have to feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost on top of your head.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.920
-Is it there now?
-Yes it is there.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.020
-Can I feel it?
- I don’t know if you’ll feel it or not,

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.020
because you have to have that sensitivity.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:07.020
Now, it is all around, also that All-pervading Power is there, which makes everything vibrate.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.220
But this energy can be felt only when you have got that Realization.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.220
Then what happens that all your centers on your fingertips become sensitive.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:23.660
And you can feel this is written in the Quran that your hands will speak when you get to your Resurrection.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.720
- Yes.
- This is a Resurrection.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.120
But Mataji, you must know, you must realize, I mentioned about Maharishi, about the bad ones,

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.120
you must live with the sceptics and the doubters because...

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.120
-Of course, of course, I’m living with them all the time.
-Because they come before you.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:44.020
Now firstly you see, the great mistake we commit, as far as going to gurus or to anything that is religious,

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.620
is that you cannot pay for God.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.520
You see it's a living process of a living God.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.600
Now supposing you want to sprout a seed.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.320
How much money do you pay to the Mother Earth?

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.020
It's a very simple thing, but people don't understand.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.120
They think that they can purchase everything.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.320
You cannot purchase God.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.620
A simple method if you apply to all of them they will all run away.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:14.020
Yes, now again. I read that the Spirit, this power you speak of, can deal with ...common

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.720
I'm into the content, but can deal with cancer, with AIDS,
-Yes, yes.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:23.260
I've had some Australians talk about their children being heroin addicts and and

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.920
Yes, of course, of course, it can, it does. Because see I'll show you now.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.320
This is the centre, you can say this is the medulla oblongata

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.210
or we can say this is through which the central canal is passing.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:39.920
Now, the centre is inside here.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:44.420
Now when we are in the imbalance, say we go too much towards the left side

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:48.920
means we become too emotional or do all kinds of wrong nonsensical conditionings,

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.420
then or if you go too much to the right in ego and all that, you see, then we break.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.520
Once we break this what happens that

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:03.020
the center becomes constricted and the energy becomes constricted.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:08.020
Slowly it breaks the relationship with the head, with the whole

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.520
and it becomes malignant. When it becomes malignant

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:16.520
it starts overpowering other cells and that's how cancer is settled.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.820
Now when the Kundalini rises what she does

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.870
she enlightens this centre here, first of all, she brings it back to normal

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:28.320
and then she goes up there, pierces through by which she does one great thing

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.320
is to make you in contact with the All-pervading Power.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.520
And once that power starts flowing through you, you don't have to worry.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.490
You become absolutely peaceful, all your troubles are over.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.120
Actually, most of the troubles can be over once you are the Spirit.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.650
All right. It's very difficult to understand and

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:50.520
Understand ..[...] as I'm doing now. You have offered to give a demonstration with our audience?

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.110
-Yes, I think I'll try but it's a very short time.
-Would you like?

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.920
And they are all in a hurry I think to catch the buses or something.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.320
No. no, they've got time to try.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.020
All right. Let's see.

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.020
Now, you just put your hands towards me, just like this.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:12.020
And put your right hand on your heart.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.420
and say with full faith in yourself that you are the Spirit.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.620
That's in your heart you have to say. "Mother, I am the Spirit".

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:26.320
You can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.040
"I am the Spirit". Please say three times

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.520
with full confidence in yourself.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:47.020
Now put the right hand towards me and see on top of your head

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:51.020
if you are getting a cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:56.720
Yes, yes, here. On top of ... some people get it that high.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.020
Watch me without thinking. Watch me without thinking.

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:05.100
Put your right hand towards me, right, right hand towards me,

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.620
right hand towards me and left hand on top of your head.

00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:14.220
Right hand I am saying, right hand towards me you are doing all wrong.

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.210
Now see. Is it all right?

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:22.020
-Are you getting the cool breeze in your head?
-Say yes, if you are.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:29.020
Yes, yes, yes. I can see your eyes are.. Eyes will start glistening, you see, there will be a light in your eyes.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:36.020
Now, are you thinking now? Just watch me without thinking. Let's see, can you do that?

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:41.720
Watch me without thinking. Can you do that?

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.840
You can.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.120
You cannot do that otherwise. You see, so you have gone beyond thought.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.520
Now just feel it. Are you feeling it in the hand also? Just let's see.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.420
Put your hands up if you've felt some way.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.820
Put up all your hands. All of those who have felt it.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.520
Put both the hands. I would like to see both the hands.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.520
Let me show them, Madame.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.660
Yes, so many of them who have got it.

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.120
-Now we have some of your followers here ...
-Yes, who else?

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.520
-up, up here we had.
-All right, let's see.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.300
Those who have felt in the head just put your hands up.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.500
Surprising, the audience seems to be..

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:34.980
Yesterday we had 1500 people out there and about 500 people upstairs.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.620
-And most of them got Realisation.
-Yes.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.020
Now, in fact, we should have said in the past when you've done it in Britain and

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.820
you've actually through radio and television you've told people

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:47.520
-at home to do the same.
-No, it’s Hong Kong. I did it in Hong Kong. Not in a..

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.090
In Hong Kong people are very sensitive. There are very sensitive people in Hong Kong.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:56.820
Perhaps they are in trouble now, because they have to go away and all that. May be that is it.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.020
People who are in need are more sensitive, are they?

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:03.020
I’d think so, because then they hanker after God.

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:08.320
You see, otherwise they think. “We are alright, what to care for God, you see, who is God after all?”

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.820
So it happens. But it should happen to so many.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.020
I'm surprised they haven't got.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:16.320
Let's see again how many have got it. Let's see.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.430
Put your hands up. Let's see. Just see.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.930
They're reluctant even to put the hand to see, you see?

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.320
Now just see it on your head.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.620
I've been distracted actually. I'm not a fair test for this because I've been watching things happening in this studio.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:31.150
Yes, that's it and they are...

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.520
Are you feeling it?

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.520
No? None of you?

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.690
I think there’s something wrong.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:41.620
I can feel the breezes coming from them, I can feel it.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.920
Some of them are do feeling it. You see those, who are really feeling it,

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.820
do not feel ashamed and just say "Yes, we are feeling it. That's the best.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:53.120
Can you raise your hands now, let's see?

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.520
These are all my disciples I think.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:02.520
-Surprising. Otherwise Australians are very good.
-Are they? We were receptive, were we?

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:07.520
They are the best people. They are very innocent  and they get their realization very fast.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.520
They stick on to it, and they have done wonders. They have done wonders.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:16.320
I should make the point that I saw one of your advertisements in one of the papers today and  I think your..

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:21.010
there is a meeting tonight at the State Theatre in Sydney, but there is no fee charge.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:22.020
Of course not.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.020
-You’re not charging?
-No, no, not at all,

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:26.520
-You are not rounding up money?
-No.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.420
No, I should make. Alright, we thank you for your time.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.320
You're staying another week or so in Australia?
-Yes.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:35.020
You’ve been to other states, and you are now doing in Sydney?
-Yes. I’ll be going to Melbourne.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.520
-Sydney, Melbourne and New Zealand.
-And to New Zealand also.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.020
Alright, we thank you. I'm sure if you'd like to see Mataji,
-Thank you very much.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.410
