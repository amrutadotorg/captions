00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:14.710
Today, we are going to do Puja for Navaratri.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.420
Yesterday you saw a beautiful description

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.494
of Navaratri, and how

00:00:33.843 --> 00:00:41.751
the Mother Goddess has created all kinds of powers within you.

00:00:43.622 --> 00:00:47.238
It's not that only She has the powers,

00:00:47.644 --> 00:00:50.328
but you all have the powers

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.536
and you can all work it out.

00:00:54.343 --> 00:01:00.278
You can all find out whether these powers are there or not.

00:01:03.518 --> 00:01:10.114
With us the Realization is very important,

00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:17.706
but there the Kundalini has given you this Realization.

00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:22.852
Of course Kundalini is a part,

00:01:23.181 --> 00:01:28.172
or we can say reflection, of Adi Shakti, and also

00:01:43.253 --> 00:01:48.419
the Jagadamba is also part of Adi Shakti.

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:18.357
She is placed in the center of two Hearts,

00:02:20.137 --> 00:02:22.745
which is a very important point.

00:02:24.555 --> 00:02:31.787
Now, all these powers are placed in that chakra.

00:02:33.058 --> 00:02:36.889
So, you imagine how many of these powers must be.

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:45.933
And Her powers are expressed through

00:02:46.126 --> 00:02:54.969
the center Heart in all the Ganas you have around your body.

00:02:57.212 --> 00:03:02.994
Now these Ganas are the ones who do give you the protection,

00:03:04.094 --> 00:03:11.861
give you the sleep, give you the energy, give you the blessings

00:03:12.778 --> 00:03:16.347
- all of them are at work all the time -

00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:27.277
and these bodies are extremely dedicated

00:03:28.128 --> 00:03:31.734
and connected all the time to the Mother

00:03:32.494 --> 00:03:35.521
Amba: we can call, Jagadamba.

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.596
Now She is the Mother of the universe;

00:03:42.525 --> 00:03:44.283
so, you can imagine it,

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.139
how busy She has to be to look after the whole universe.

00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:55.829
When this center becomes weak,

00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:04.708
that means Her connection with the Ganas is reduced.

00:04:05.393 --> 00:04:08.012
Ganas also are weak,

00:04:08.806 --> 00:04:15.903
and all the powers that could be exercised,

00:04:16.369 --> 00:04:21.122
cannot be done because of this weakness.

00:04:23.855 --> 00:04:28.095
It's a very subtle center

00:04:28.703 --> 00:04:31.693
because it is Mother's center;

00:04:32.056 --> 00:04:35.321
is impossible to understand the love of Mother.

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:39.913
It's absolutely impossible.

00:04:40.995 --> 00:04:45.108
When the girls get married, and they become mothers,

00:04:45.323 --> 00:04:47.214
then they start understanding

00:04:47.394 --> 00:04:51.770
how much their mother must have done for them to come up.

00:04:52.506 --> 00:05:01.007
In the same way, when Sahaja Yogis become good Sahaja Yogis,

00:05:02.673 --> 00:05:06.434
like Ganas, they realize how much

00:05:06.616 --> 00:05:11.440
the Ganas had to have patience, had to have love

00:05:11.634 --> 00:05:15.443
and intelligence, to fight the negativity.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.293
So, all the forces of the Jagadamba act towards

00:05:21.524 --> 00:05:24.401
hitting the negativity of all kinds.

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:29.282
That is Her first and foremost nature

00:05:29.511 --> 00:05:32.096
- is to destroy all the negativity

00:05:32.346 --> 00:05:39.897
that is in this world and is against Sahaj, against you.

00:05:43.942 --> 00:05:47.972
Her destruction takes place in so many ways.

00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:55.498
First of all, we have to know that if you sin against the Goddess,

00:05:56.679 --> 00:06:01.140
then all kinds of physical problems start

00:06:01.526 --> 00:06:05.460
- like psychosomatic diseases, all kinds:

00:06:08.193 --> 00:06:13.899
we can say cancer, AIDS, all of them.

00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:17.097
But some of the diseases

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:22.414
have got also the mixed up with the Ganapati.

00:06:23.095 --> 00:06:28.954
Now Ganapati is the Lord of all the Ganas.

00:06:29.453 --> 00:06:35.309
So, the Mother has Ganapati, and She controls all these Ganas

00:06:35.605 --> 00:06:41.621
through her son Ganapati. It is so connected.

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:46.789
So the sin against the Mother when we do

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.205
- means when we become immoral.

00:06:49.454 --> 00:06:55.837
Immoral means when we start indulging into things

00:06:57.584 --> 00:07:00.575
which are not permitted by dharma.

00:07:02.014 --> 00:07:05.495
By dharma whatever is permitted is the legal.

00:07:06.732 --> 00:07:09.329
Now you people understand Sahaj dharma

00:07:09.672 --> 00:07:12.402
innately, from within. I didn't have to tell you.

00:07:12.583 --> 00:07:16.372
Now you know this is wrong, is wrong, this is right, this is right.

00:07:16.807 --> 00:07:22.126
So any such things when you try to do,

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.501
because She is a Mother, She takes time to punish you.

00:07:28.632 --> 00:07:32.563
No doubt. But if you commit a sin against the Father,

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:36.989
like boastfulness, talking big, being cruel, harsh and all that

00:07:37.214 --> 00:07:40.933
- immediately the punishment comes in.

00:07:42.383 --> 00:07:47.637
But from Her, She being the Ocean of compassion,

00:07:47.975 --> 00:07:51.764
the punishment is more delayed,

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:59.522
and a full chance is given to the person to improve himself

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:04.661
and guide himself. But when the punishment starts,

00:08:04.962 --> 00:08:11.055
then you get into diseases which are of a very serious nature.

00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:18.597
So it comes from one thing, what we call as
fear.

00:08:19.371 --> 00:08:26.561
When somebody frightens you or aggresses you,

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.491
or becomes like a maskit as they say;

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:37.015
somebody who is oppressed by aggressive people

00:08:38.761 --> 00:08:44.237
or is threatened, intimidated,

00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:50.504
then a person starts losing faith in the powers of Mother.

00:08:51.219 --> 00:08:56.020
As a result, such a person -

00:08:57.054 --> 00:09:01.355
The child is talking too much. Can you take away the child from there?

00:09:01.355 --> 00:09:05.502
Where is he? Outside?

00:09:06.482 --> 00:09:10.684
Ask them to control the children. 

00:09:11.104 --> 00:09:13.398
You must control. This is negative child who is talking.

00:09:16.152 --> 00:09:20.166
Who is the child? Whose child it is?

00:09:21.566 --> 00:09:22.896
Who is that? 

00:09:26.863 --> 00:09:29.403
Please look after your child; it's not normal. 

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:37.277
Normally, children who are all right become very quiet during My speech.

00:09:45.725 --> 00:09:48.588
Now take him- take her out, ask her to take her out.

00:10:22.849 --> 00:10:27.586
So, this Center Heart is to be looked after.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:33.761
Out of fear, if somebody is thrown on to the left side,

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:37.172
away from the Mother,

00:10:38.682 --> 00:10:41.754
because She is the one who gives us confidence,

00:10:42.214 --> 00:10:46.063
who gives us courage and bravery.

00:10:46.936 --> 00:10:52.206
But if you are frightened, or if you are under fear,

00:10:53.061 --> 00:10:56.644
also you can be thrown to the left side;

00:10:56.894 --> 00:11:01.219
and you can get into all kind of diseases

00:11:01.358 --> 00:11:05.791
which are very serious, incurable as they call them.

00:11:07.225 --> 00:11:13.487
Another thing is if you are driven by your senses

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:21.423
into indulgences without any dharma,

00:11:22.324 --> 00:11:30.292
then also this central path throws away, you can say,

00:11:30.418 --> 00:11:34.298
you to the left side, because you are not worthy of being

00:11:34.495 --> 00:11:37.056
at the lotus feet of the Mother.

00:11:41.879 --> 00:11:48.534
Now, this center is the one which when we are afraid,

00:11:48.758 --> 00:11:50.832
the sternum bone starts

00:11:51.111 --> 00:11:53.695
moving like a remote control and informs

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.639
all the Ganas that the attack is coming.

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.929
But when you deliberately go to the left side,

00:12:03.187 --> 00:12:07.076
and get into indulgences, then they are not bothered.

00:12:08.111 --> 00:12:10.979
They said, "All right, go ahead, do what you like;

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.100
you can behave the way you want to behave".

00:12:14.315 --> 00:12:21.596
All these different types of movements towards the left,

00:12:21.808 --> 00:12:25.128
takes you away from your Mother.

00:12:27.885 --> 00:12:30.957
I'll tell you a story about somebody in America.

00:12:31.494 --> 00:12:34.180
He is a very old Sahaja Yogi, Indian.

00:12:34.504 --> 00:12:38.242
He came out of his shop, where he was working,

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.322
and got into his car - there was one man sitting with a dagger.

00:12:42.503 --> 00:12:45.892
And he hit him with the dagger on the center Heart.

00:12:46.078 --> 00:12:48.074
And this fellow started bleeding.

00:12:48.363 --> 00:12:50.891
He said, " I don't know what happened to me, Mother.

00:12:51.028 --> 00:12:52.628
I got such strength,

00:12:52.887 --> 00:12:55.495
I caught hold of him and I started fighting with him,

00:12:55.655 --> 00:12:58.138
and I took the dagger from him.

00:12:58.318 --> 00:13:02.132
He had the handle and the dagger came into my hand.

00:13:02.435 --> 00:13:04.453
And the fellow ran away.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:09.076
But still I was not worried about my bleeding.

00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:11.100
What I did

00:13:11.298 --> 00:13:14.392
- I called my colleague who was coming out of the car,

00:13:14.576 --> 00:13:16.205
I ran after him

00:13:16.344 --> 00:13:19.549
and he took me in his car for half-an-hour searching that fellow".

00:13:19.709 --> 00:13:21.913
They didn't go to the police.

00:13:22.146 --> 00:13:25.102
And then they went to the police. The police was surprised,

00:13:25.261 --> 00:13:28.897
the whole shirt was full of blood.

00:13:29.251 --> 00:13:32.044
He said, "Nobody would believe". Even the police was shocked.

00:13:32.546 --> 00:13:34.775
"For half an hour you were searching this fellow.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.633
Why didn't you come to the police?"

00:13:36.796 --> 00:13:39.252
He said, "It would have taken half-an-hour for you to come,

00:13:39.411 --> 00:13:42.078
so we thought, better do it ourselves".

00:13:42.308 --> 00:13:43.668
See the courage!

00:13:45.364 --> 00:13:48.372
Then, of course, he was taken to the hospital,

00:13:48.581 --> 00:13:50.224
and he was all right.

00:13:50.562 --> 00:13:53.986
Just they stitched him up. But he is all right.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.348
That is the sign of a person

00:13:57.667 --> 00:14:01.863
who can never get any one of these horrible diseases,

00:14:02.512 --> 00:14:07.637
because there is no fear in his mind, of any kind.

00:14:09.931 --> 00:14:11.134
And, he is an Indian,

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.493
he said: "I have never even slapped my own children.

00:14:13.673 --> 00:14:15.700
I have never fought with anyone.

00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:18.890
I am not a wrestler by any chance, nothing of the kind.

00:14:19.104 --> 00:14:20.464
But it happened".

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:23.538
He says, "I don't know how, from where I got this shakti;

00:14:23.737 --> 00:14:26.902
and how I did it, I just don't know".

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:29.327
There are many stories like

00:14:29.479 --> 00:14:32.048
this they can tell you about Sahaja Yogis,

00:14:32.269 --> 00:14:38.312
and about so many saints, how they were never afraid of

00:14:43.272 --> 00:14:46.899
attacking someone when somebody attacks them,

00:14:47.281 --> 00:14:49.383
or of protecting themselves

00:14:49.681 --> 00:14:52.930
from all kinds of horrible things with their courage.

00:14:53.412 --> 00:14:57.690
This is something one cannot believe sometimes,

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:00.037
but it is happening, every day,

00:15:00.235 --> 00:15:03.345
I get letters from people how they have been courageous.

00:15:04.336 --> 00:15:06.402
If you believe in the Goddess,

00:15:06.815 --> 00:15:10.030
then know that She is extremely powerful;

00:15:10.263 --> 00:15:12.450
She is very intelligent;

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.598
and if She has to protect you, She will protect you

00:15:15.764 --> 00:15:19.128
out and out, in such a way that

00:15:19.346 --> 00:15:22.175
you will not know how you have been protected.

00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:25.469
But  this faith has to be developed.

00:15:25.866 --> 00:15:28.810
Faith has to be developed by experience also,

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:31.154
how you have been protected always;

00:15:31.283 --> 00:15:33.243
how you have been helped always;

00:15:33.382 --> 00:15:35.449
how you came out of so many crises.

00:15:35.643 --> 00:15:39.647
But despite that if you get upset, worried,

00:15:39.886 --> 00:15:44.100
if some clouds appear in the sky of your life,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.140
then if you get upset, that means you are still weak.

00:15:48.363 --> 00:15:52.148
So first thing, if you are really worshipping the Goddess,

00:15:52.328 --> 00:15:55.766
then you should have no worry at all of any kind,

00:15:55.945 --> 00:16:00.897
and you should have no fear at all. Go ahead, fearlessly.

00:16:01.234 --> 00:16:04.030
Whatever you are doing, do it fearlessly.

00:16:05.341 --> 00:16:07.849
But at the same time I have to tell you the other side,

00:16:08.013 --> 00:16:13.537
that one should not go about like a zombie,

00:16:13.774 --> 00:16:15.454
it doesn't mean that;

00:16:15.718 --> 00:16:18.596
saying all kinds of nonsensical things of the right side.

00:16:18.815 --> 00:16:21.128
But if you have to do something,

00:16:21.334 --> 00:16:23.826
do it with clear-cut ideas,

00:16:24.089 --> 00:16:27.672
and also without any fear.

00:16:29.625 --> 00:16:32.910
So all Her powers, you start manifesting it.

00:16:33.166 --> 00:16:37.245
A man who is fearless has nothing to worry

00:16:37.443 --> 00:16:41.887
about his sleep, his well-being, nothing.

00:16:42.616 --> 00:16:44.359
He is fearless.

00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:48.113
Again I say, 'fearless' doesn't mean that

00:16:48.293 --> 00:16:51.606
you go on hitting everybody, saying all kinds of things, no.

00:16:51.758 --> 00:16:54.198
It means that you are fearless:

00:16:54.396 --> 00:16:57.412
anybody who attacks you, you can always protect yourself.

00:16:57.611 --> 00:16:59.677
I mean, this story I told you,

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:02.248
because this was not a protection

00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:04.297
which was from within, like

00:17:04.666 --> 00:17:06.538
Goddess protecting them,

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.777
but actually protected himself.

00:17:09.943 --> 00:17:12.908
So the power had started working through him.

00:17:13.548 --> 00:17:16.831
You should allow your mind, your body

00:17:17.704 --> 00:17:19.384
to project these powers.

00:17:20.108 --> 00:17:23.696
Otherwise we say here pujas, everything, all right;

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.474
and the power is there;

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:31.207
but your mind which tells you, "No, no, no, this is not so".

00:17:31.529 --> 00:17:34.481
There's so many stories,

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:39.263
so many miracles people have described about this.

00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:44.144
So, first of all, you should not have any fear about anything.

00:17:44.402 --> 00:17:46.628
If you have done nothing wrong,

00:17:48.078 --> 00:17:51.271
if you are on the right path, you will be always protected.

00:17:51.741 --> 00:17:55.856
Now remember this: you will be always protected.

00:17:56.585 --> 00:17:59.414
Remember this and believe in this,

00:17:59.931 --> 00:18:01.931
that, "I am always protected".

00:18:02.768 --> 00:18:05.042
This is something very difficult,

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:08.078
because perhaps our mind gives ideas,

00:18:08.184 --> 00:18:11.133
"Oh God, what will happen now; what is going to happen?

00:18:11.292 --> 00:18:12.972
This thing, that thing".

00:18:15.383 --> 00:18:19.065
So, first and foremost thing, as I said,

00:18:19.245 --> 00:18:25.514
is to be fearless - to make the Goddess express Herself.

00:18:26.832 --> 00:18:28.795
Supposing now, take it like this:

00:18:28.978 --> 00:18:31.217
now all Ganas are following you.

00:18:31.695 --> 00:18:38.975
Now if the leader of an army is a frightened personality,

00:18:39.353 --> 00:18:41.033
what will others do?

00:18:43.609 --> 00:18:50.707
Thus, you become dependent upon yourself.

00:18:52.487 --> 00:18:55.409
This faith also must be developed.

00:18:55.688 --> 00:18:58.584
I have seen people who are sick

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:01.194
- so they must come and see Me,

00:19:01.408 --> 00:19:04.541
because they do not depend upon themselves. They can

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.291
cure themselves. There is no need for them to come and see Me.

00:19:08.467 --> 00:19:12.288
There are many cases where people have cured themselves,

00:19:12.567 --> 00:19:15.344
cured others, just with prayer.

00:19:15.585 --> 00:19:20.762
But the faith, when it is not matured,

00:19:20.962 --> 00:19:23.533
then they think I, I should treat them.

00:19:23.712 --> 00:19:26.012
I should touch them, I should do this, I should do that.

00:19:26.158 --> 00:19:27.838
Now I have stopped it.

00:19:28.023 --> 00:19:29.790
I used to do once upon a time.

00:19:29.929 --> 00:19:32.559
Reason is, now you depend upon yourself.

00:19:32.937 --> 00:19:34.993
Not only that you can

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.284
help yourself, but you are going to help others.

00:19:37.424 --> 00:19:40.153
But if you do not have faith in yourself,

00:19:40.332 --> 00:19:44.589
that you can cure, you can look after yourself,

00:19:44.769 --> 00:19:47.566
you can protect yourself; so the whole

00:19:47.804 --> 00:19:49.978
thing becomes like a ...

00:19:50.158 --> 00:19:52.958
all the time the Mother has to do the job.

00:19:54.692 --> 00:19:58.216
Now you, first of all, you have to feed the little baby;

00:19:58.376 --> 00:19:59.376
all right?

00:19:59.527 --> 00:20:03.896
You can get him aid, look after him, do everything.

00:20:04.088 --> 00:20:05.622
But when he grows up,

00:20:05.781 --> 00:20:08.848
then he doesn't want his mother to feed him.

00:20:09.066 --> 00:20:11.347
In the same way, the Sahaja Yogis now,

00:20:11.507 --> 00:20:13.431
how many years I have been working.

00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:19.720
You have to grow up dignified and you should mature,

00:20:20.166 --> 00:20:24.880
so that you can yourself do things properly.

00:20:26.785 --> 00:20:32.074
This maturity is there because your Mother has blessed you.

00:20:32.829 --> 00:20:36.603
All Her powers She has given you - every.

00:20:38.231 --> 00:20:44.036
But one power, of patience, is difficult.

00:20:45.802 --> 00:20:48.536
You have to be patient like your Mother.

00:20:49.631 --> 00:20:52.959
You might think it's very difficult. But try to be.

00:20:53.326 --> 00:20:56.449
Must have patience, first of all, with yourself.

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.654
I have known many people

00:20:58.873 --> 00:21:00.725
who think they are spiritually nothing

00:21:00.883 --> 00:21:02.600
and they have not achieved anything.

00:21:04.247 --> 00:21:08.116
This is absolutely a sort of a escapicism,

00:21:08.671 --> 00:21:11.471
that you want to escape your personality.

00:21:11.648 --> 00:21:14.536
Just see. If you introspect, you will find out

00:21:14.715 --> 00:21:19.766
that you have developed into a real spiritual giant now.

00:21:20.005 --> 00:21:21.685
Nobody can touch you;

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:25.751
you can do everything; you can look after yourself;

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:27.570
you can support others.

00:21:28.231 --> 00:21:30.969
Whatever are the powers

00:21:31.187 --> 00:21:34.195
of all these that they were singing yesterday,

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:38.479
all these powers are manifesting in you.

00:21:38.818 --> 00:21:42.996
But still you leave it to chance and,

00:21:43.175 --> 00:21:46.695
I should say, you leave it to others, not to yourself.

00:21:49.718 --> 00:21:53.559
Now this is one point

00:21:53.738 --> 00:21:58.083
that no one, so far, has done this kind of a job

00:21:58.322 --> 00:22:03.460
- is to connect all the disciples to the Divine power.

00:22:06.674 --> 00:22:10.197
Because it is the Divine power of love,

00:22:10.337 --> 00:22:15.289
you must know how to love others. That's very important.

00:22:15.547 --> 00:22:18.098
But again, when it comes to love,

00:22:18.316 --> 00:22:20.489
they will love their child, love their wife;

00:22:20.648 --> 00:22:22.937
I mean it is very common in Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:23.136 --> 00:22:26.114
They are too attached to their children. Before this,

00:22:26.312 --> 00:22:29.400
they were known to be absolutely selfish,

00:22:29.657 --> 00:22:33.368
had no attachment for children or wife or anything.

00:22:33.665 --> 00:22:35.465
But now it is like a glue.

00:22:36.007 --> 00:22:39.331
Children are glued to them, wife is glued to them

00:22:39.491 --> 00:22:41.691
and the family - very important.

00:22:42.663 --> 00:22:47.340
This is another temptation from which you have to get out.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:50.815
I am not saying that you have to give up your family or your child.

00:22:50.975 --> 00:22:53.241
But, again I say, the detachment.

00:22:53.971 --> 00:22:57.145
The detachment is your power.

00:22:59.328 --> 00:23:01.998
Watch everything with detachment.

00:23:02.197 --> 00:23:03.617
Now don't think that,

00:23:03.737 --> 00:23:07.248
 "Oh, I came only a few days back in Sahaja Yoga". No.

00:23:07.487 --> 00:23:11.307
Don't think, "Somebody is higher than me; I am no good". No.

00:23:11.685 --> 00:23:17.815
You just introspect yourself and see for yourself

00:23:18.292 --> 00:23:22.637
how many powers you have already got.

00:23:23.649 --> 00:23:28.006
And the more you'll know, the more you'll become humble.

00:23:28.959 --> 00:23:33.085
It's very surprising. You'll become humble.

00:23:33.681 --> 00:23:35.875
No fear of any kind.

00:23:36.073 --> 00:23:39.537
You can have fear if you have some,

00:23:39.737 --> 00:23:41.603
say, lot of money with you.

00:23:41.842 --> 00:23:46.066
If you are very well educated, you might have fear of jealousies.

00:23:46.326 --> 00:23:50.583
If you have other wealth like ornaments and things, you will be

00:23:50.743 --> 00:23:53.210
afraid of big thieves coming around.

00:23:54.056 --> 00:23:57.657
If you are a politician, you might be afraid

00:23:57.955 --> 00:24:02.399
that somebody might take away your seat when you are away.

00:24:03.272 --> 00:24:09.136
But, when it comes really to Sahaja Yoga, it's the other way round.

00:24:10.292 --> 00:24:12.786
Who can steal your Self-realization?

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:21.615
Tell me! Who can steal your powers?

00:24:22.329 --> 00:24:27.202
Who can steal your vibrations? Think of it.

00:24:29.028 --> 00:24:32.817
And who can steal your love?

00:24:34.961 --> 00:24:37.948
Because it is coming from the Spirit,

00:24:38.306 --> 00:24:42.055
which is eternal, and the flow is all the time there.

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:44.937
Only when you go away from your Spirit,

00:24:46.896 --> 00:24:52.848
then only you feel all these things,

00:24:53.028 --> 00:24:55.161
which one feels in the darkness.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:06.284
Then another power of Mother is that She gives you

00:25:06.562 --> 00:25:10.768
a state in which you are a sakshi, you are a witness,

00:25:11.025 --> 00:25:12.769
watching everything.

00:25:14.059 --> 00:25:16.059
You have tremendous patience;

00:25:18.761 --> 00:25:20.388
tremendous patience.

00:25:21.081 --> 00:25:23.394
Whatever's happened, all right, let it be.

00:25:23.593 --> 00:25:26.430
This will be all right, that will be all right, this and that.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:30.431
So you get rid of a horrible thing called anger.

00:25:31.367 --> 00:25:38.489
And this gives you such a peaceful witness state,

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:41.748
that you start becoming younger and younger.

00:25:41.950 --> 00:25:44.129
I will tell you, some Sahaja Yogis

00:25:44.308 --> 00:25:46.688
whom I gave Realization, say, last year,

00:25:47.105 --> 00:25:49.607
this year I met them - I could not recognize.

00:25:49.766 --> 00:25:52.464
They have suddenly become ten years younger.

00:25:53.417 --> 00:25:58.270
It's very surprising. And I was Myself,

00:25:58.473 --> 00:26:01.495
had to confess that I really, I can't recognize

00:26:01.695 --> 00:26:05.855
that are you the same people, or are you the son of that fellow?

00:26:10.107 --> 00:26:13.511
So then, what happens to you

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:17.599
is that you become a peaceful personality. Why?

00:26:18.451 --> 00:26:21.143
Because your Mother is there always.

00:26:21.639 --> 00:26:25.627
This faith: She is always there, She is always with us,

00:26:25.765 --> 00:26:27.939
always protecting us:

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.789
but now we are grown up, so She has given us all the powers.

00:26:31.988 --> 00:26:34.559
All the property She has given us; so what,

00:26:35.215 --> 00:26:37.281
what is there to be afraid of?

00:26:38.905 --> 00:26:43.706
But this faith has to be not just a blind faith,

00:26:43.885 --> 00:26:45.821
but an enlightened faith.

00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:49.821
Now the difference is, in blind faith

00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:52.060
you have faith but no powers.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:56.228
In enlightened faith, you have faith and all the powers.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:05.059
When that happens to you, you start growing very much fast

00:27:05.397 --> 00:27:07.412
- first in your dharma.

00:27:07.988 --> 00:27:10.588
And you are not afraid of your virtues.

00:27:12.482 --> 00:27:19.237
You tell people, talk about Sahaja Yoga everywhere,

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.624
and it works, it clicks.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.803
Once you don't have any fear,

00:27:24.943 --> 00:27:27.609
the whole picture will be clear to you,

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.123
because you become a visionary:

00:27:30.855 --> 00:27:33.322
what we call in Sanskrit 'drishtas'.

00:27:33.554 --> 00:27:37.660
Like see how C. S. Lewis could see our procession.

00:27:38.129 --> 00:27:42.057
How could William Blake predict our future?

00:27:42.295 --> 00:27:43.627
How could

00:27:45.601 --> 00:27:48.067
Gyaneshwara, wrote about 'Pasayadan',

00:27:48.226 --> 00:27:50.666
which is a description of all the Sahaja Yogis?

00:27:50.811 --> 00:27:54.032
But all the time he is saying, "Now you get up and walk,

00:27:54.171 --> 00:27:57.088
and do this, you are that, now you've got it".

00:27:57.225 --> 00:28:00.125
He is trying to assure people all the time.

00:28:00.937 --> 00:28:05.758
How could Rabindranath Tagore see our going to Ganapatipule?

00:28:06.374 --> 00:28:07.974
How could it happen?

00:28:08.204 --> 00:28:11.589
It happens only when people are

00:28:11.886 --> 00:28:14.200
in enlightened faith.

00:28:18.308 --> 00:28:21.950
In enlightened faith your Mother

00:28:22.228 --> 00:28:26.763
gives you another very great power, is of discretion;

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.380
of discretion.

00:28:28.603 --> 00:28:31.537
Somebody came to me, "Mother, You see,

00:28:32.203 --> 00:28:34.734
this gentleman is very good, this, that;

00:28:34.873 --> 00:28:39.496
and You know nobody has looked after him, this, that.

00:28:39.675 --> 00:28:42.742
He is very well educated, very moneyed person, this, that".

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:45.202
I said, "All right, show Me the photograph".

00:28:45.797 --> 00:28:48.408
I saw the photograph. I said, "No

00:28:48.964 --> 00:28:51.564
- yes,better keep him out. Absolutely.

00:28:51.762 --> 00:28:54.341
Keep him out!" He was amazed.

00:28:54.679 --> 00:28:57.279
"How You say keep him out absolutely?"

00:28:57.615 --> 00:29:00.504
I saw the photograph, and in the photograph only

00:29:00.722 --> 00:29:04.186
how could Mother say that? I could feel the vibrations.

00:29:04.703 --> 00:29:08.166
Immediately I said, "It's wrong".

00:29:08.623 --> 00:29:12.651
One gentleman came here and told Me that some

00:29:12.889 --> 00:29:15.341
Nigerians have written letter to him,

00:29:15.492 --> 00:29:17.348
that, "You put thirty-five

00:29:19.214 --> 00:29:22.678
thousand pounds in the bank", or something like that,

00:29:23.034 --> 00:29:27.371
"and we'll put our money, quite a lot, in millions,

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:30.263
and then you can have one third of that".

00:29:31.578 --> 00:29:34.209
He came and told Me this story. I said, "Really?

00:29:34.506 --> 00:29:39.882
Keep out of it". So he said, "Why?" "It's a scam".

00:29:40.796 --> 00:29:44.200
When he went back to America, they found it was a scam.

00:29:45.312 --> 00:29:47.078
He said, "Mother, how did you know?"

00:29:47.376 --> 00:29:50.384
I said, "You can feel the vibrations, so hot!

00:29:51.403 --> 00:29:53.022
So, it is a scam".

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:58.768
You have got vibrations. You can feel your vibrations.

00:29:58.887 --> 00:30:02.510
Now if you don't want to use this new awareness,

00:30:02.689 --> 00:30:05.166
what is the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

00:30:05.385 --> 00:30:08.492
He was very upset when I told him, "Forget it".

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.070
He thought:

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:12.010
"Why Mother is saying so?"

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:14.508
I said, "Now what do you need money for? You need money?

00:30:14.607 --> 00:30:16.869
All right. We have. Don't take these things".

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:22.047
When I told him it's a scam, he got a shock.

00:30:22.532 --> 00:30:25.738
When he went back, he found out it was a scam. So

00:30:25.957 --> 00:30:32.357
at the airport only, he was on My feet prostrated.

00:30:32.481 --> 00:30:33.857
I said, "What happened?"

00:30:33.977 --> 00:30:36.853
"Mother, You are the limit. What You said is there".

00:30:36.973 --> 00:30:41.456
I said, "But it was the vibrations which told Me that he

00:30:41.695 --> 00:30:45.643
is a cheat. So, if he says so,

00:30:46.654 --> 00:30:48.996
that he is going to give you so much money,

00:30:49.255 --> 00:30:52.857
is not correct because his vibrations were so very bad".

00:30:54.465 --> 00:31:02.897
In this way, you can gradually experience.

00:31:03.552 --> 00:31:07.733
With the experience, try to put the experience in your heart

00:31:08.388 --> 00:31:11.899
and have faith in that experience.

00:31:13.586 --> 00:31:17.050
What were you? What have you become now?

00:31:17.388 --> 00:31:20.524
How many experiences of Sahaja Yoga you had?

00:31:20.742 --> 00:31:25.901
- of the Mother's attention on you.

00:31:27.012 --> 00:31:32.242
Now if you have that enlightened faith, enlightened faith in you,

00:31:32.561 --> 00:31:34.241
you become powerful...

00:31:35.575 --> 00:31:39.128
You are powerless, because your faith is like this.

00:31:41.846 --> 00:31:47.606
But if you become really a evolved, matured

00:31:48.703 --> 00:31:53.247
realized soul, then all your powers will work.

00:31:54.872 --> 00:31:57.143
There's a fisherman in India,

00:32:13.294 --> 00:32:14.972
who is

00:32:15.885 --> 00:32:19.249
- I mean, he is a graduate though he is a fisherman.

00:32:19.786 --> 00:32:23.932
So one day, he was going on a boat

00:32:24.329 --> 00:32:27.821
to another island to do Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:28.872 --> 00:32:31.701
And when he came out of his hut, he found

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.360
huge big clouds, black ones,

00:32:34.579 --> 00:32:37.046
hovering and the Vishnumaya playing.

00:32:37.773 --> 00:32:39.573
Just he stood on the shore

00:32:40.113 --> 00:32:41.910
and told Vishnumaya,

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:45.162
"Please tell these clouds to behave themselves.

00:32:45.384 --> 00:32:47.261
I am going for the work of Mother,

00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:50.729
and dare not trouble me on the way". Just told it.

00:32:51.431 --> 00:32:53.784
The people who were with him, told me that

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:56.563
this Harishchandra was talking like that.

00:32:56.762 --> 00:32:59.432
They got into the boat. They did the program,

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:04.710
came home. When he went into his boat, the rain started.

00:33:06.001 --> 00:33:11.992
So you control all five elements by your enlightened faith.

00:33:14.047 --> 00:33:17.213
For which you don't even have to say anything.

00:33:17.928 --> 00:33:20.528
The powers are so great that they act.

00:33:20.766 --> 00:33:24.686
See now: today when the Puja was to be done,

00:33:24.865 --> 00:33:27.731
suddenly it became pleasant. I didn't ask.

00:33:28.456 --> 00:33:33.158
Just it became pleasant, much better than yesterday:

00:33:33.535 --> 00:33:36.126
could have been very cold.

00:33:36.662 --> 00:33:43.658
But this should become again, a faith which is reality.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:48.082
If you remember last time, we had a horrible rain

00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:52.209
and the whole thing was jumping up and people had to

00:33:52.448 --> 00:33:55.753
pull all these pillars down.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:34:00.575
As soon as they started saying My 'Jai', it stopped.

00:34:01.508 --> 00:34:04.041
Now, this experience should make you;

00:34:04.423 --> 00:34:06.824
there was no need for you to pull the...

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:12.955
these pillars, but you had to just sing My 'Jai', that's all.

00:34:13.192 --> 00:34:15.147
Instead of that, you were busy with pulling

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.950
all of you that thing.

00:34:17.103 --> 00:34:19.356
I was just looking at you, I didn't know

00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:21.916
what to say anything; I said, "Let them try".

00:34:22.491 --> 00:34:27.363
So these ordeals also come to make you mature.

00:34:27.522 --> 00:34:30.410
These ordeals if they are not there,

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.838
these ordeals if they do not come,

00:34:35.982 --> 00:34:39.033
then you will not supersede them;

00:34:39.192 --> 00:34:41.513
and if you will not supersede them,

00:34:41.672 --> 00:34:44.206
you will not know what is your faith.

00:34:44.767 --> 00:34:48.060
A person who is standing on the shore

00:34:48.358 --> 00:34:50.520
will say, "I don't know how to swim".

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:53.727
But supposing you made him jump into the water

00:34:53.887 --> 00:34:57.993
and he swims, then he knows that he can swim.

00:35:00.176 --> 00:35:03.120
Because you do not know what you have become.

00:35:04.422 --> 00:35:06.756
You do not know that you can swim.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.009
You do not know that you can also save others.

00:35:10.101 --> 00:35:11.621
You are still busy

00:35:11.767 --> 00:35:14.327
with small, small, little, little things here and there.

00:35:15.383 --> 00:35:19.723
But if you just know what you have become,

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:28.489
then you are going to completely change.

00:35:29.284 --> 00:35:35.862
Your smallness, which looks like a little particle,

00:35:36.379 --> 00:35:38.112
will cover the whole sky.

00:35:39.613 --> 00:35:42.787
But this power that is within you,

00:35:43.236 --> 00:35:44.916
will not give you ego.

00:35:45.815 --> 00:35:48.715
One thing, the test is, it makes you humble.

00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:53.364
This is one of the things: that it makes you humble,

00:35:53.504 --> 00:35:56.171
and extremely loving and compassionate.

00:35:56.352 --> 00:36:00.640
You will not hurt other people with these powers; that's the sign:

00:36:00.896 --> 00:36:05.590
it is Mother's love, power of Mother's love.

00:36:06.027 --> 00:36:10.114
A person who has a mother, very loving and nice,

00:36:10.293 --> 00:36:12.093
it's a psychological fact,

00:36:12.475 --> 00:36:14.769
becomes a very nice person;

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.339
it's a psychological fact.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:23.947
So now if you realize what you are now,

00:36:24.367 --> 00:36:26.025
what you have become.

00:36:26.243 --> 00:36:29.112
Navaratri Puja is, that's why, is a very, very

00:36:29.271 --> 00:36:30.898
powerful Puja in a way:

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:37.965
because it manifests, opens out

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:42.700
the channels of your power, that's why it's very, very
important;

00:36:42.846 --> 00:36:47.699
and since morning I have been just

00:36:48.909 --> 00:36:52.433
flowing with vibrations, tremendous, it was like a

00:36:52.592 --> 00:36:55.865
waterfall of vibrations.

00:36:56.044 --> 00:36:59.238
And the whole time I am seeing light, light, light, light; I was

00:36:59.398 --> 00:37:03.306
thinking, "Now I don't know what am I going to speak or something"

00:37:03.485 --> 00:37:05.123
That's why I closed My eyes,

00:37:05.282 --> 00:37:07.762
because all the time there will be something else

00:37:07.921 --> 00:37:10.421
I will be seeing and not you people; so better, I thought,

00:37:10.501 --> 00:37:12.101
I'll close My eyes.

00:37:12.543 --> 00:37:18.175
But now you are the light. You are the light.

00:37:19.592 --> 00:37:23.533
Light is not afraid of darkness, is it?

00:37:25.101 --> 00:37:27.567
Because, it can remove the darkness.

00:37:28.295 --> 00:37:31.751
That's what you are, but you don't know what you are,

00:37:32.581 --> 00:37:36.707
and you live with very small, very small

00:37:37.001 --> 00:37:39.492
ideas about yourself.

00:37:40.325 --> 00:37:44.999
I am not saying that you should become like gurus

00:37:45.159 --> 00:37:49.782
that go round talking big, with two horns on their head, no.

00:37:50.358 --> 00:37:53.091
What is your decoration is your humility,

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:57.849
is your kindness, is your sweetness,

00:37:58.127 --> 00:38:00.194
and the way you handle people.

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:03.337
You will be amazed, I also tell people

00:38:03.497 --> 00:38:07.326
when I find there is something wrong with them. I also do it,

00:38:07.505 --> 00:38:10.103
no doubt; but in a way

00:38:10.385 --> 00:38:12.952
that the person understands it is for the

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:14.910
benevolence of that person.

00:38:15.362 --> 00:38:22.608
So the whole personality, the whole temperament,

00:38:23.754 --> 00:38:29.984
everything changes; the whole face changes;

00:38:31.492 --> 00:38:33.607
the whole movement changes.

00:38:33.786 --> 00:38:35.786
The style of talking changes,

00:38:36.544 --> 00:38:41.840
automatically as if you know the machinery has changed, within.

00:38:44.579 --> 00:38:50.829
So you develop the qualities of a real Mahayogi.

00:38:53.751 --> 00:39:00.106
This Mahayogi condition is achieved by many people also before,

00:39:06.793 --> 00:39:10.543
but they had to go through very circuitous life.

00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:16.308
They had to give up everything, not to show, but

00:39:16.468 --> 00:39:19.268
really from the heart they had to detach.

00:39:19.563 --> 00:39:23.452
They had to get out of it, go to some far-fetched places,

00:39:23.968 --> 00:39:25.972
and live on ordinary food.

00:39:26.408 --> 00:39:29.813
All kinds of even Buddha suffered so much.

00:39:30.566 --> 00:39:32.621
Christ suffered so much.

00:39:32.959 --> 00:39:35.935
They were Incarnations but still they had to suffer.

00:39:36.154 --> 00:39:40.590
Rama suffered so much; Shri Krishna suffered so much: imagine.

00:39:41.185 --> 00:39:43.719
Now you people didn't have to suffer.

00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:47.545
On the contrary you all came out of the suffering:

00:39:48.705 --> 00:39:51.879
enjoyment, music, everything.

00:39:56.046 --> 00:40:03.253
But to enjoy Sahaja Yoga, in Niranand

00:40:03.828 --> 00:40:08.279
- absolutely without anything else but joy -

00:40:09.271 --> 00:40:15.830
then one has to know that he should give up all the myths

00:40:16.145 --> 00:40:18.062
with which he is living.

00:40:18.265 --> 00:40:20.165
All kinds of myths there are.

00:40:20.304 --> 00:40:22.248
Some people have myths, "We are very poor".

00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:24.013
Some have myths, "We are very rich".

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:28.121
Some have this thing that, "We are very unhappy".

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:31.050
Some have that, "We are very happy".

00:40:31.229 --> 00:40:33.229
All kinds of myths these are.

00:40:33.907 --> 00:40:36.883
These are all myths.

00:40:37.677 --> 00:40:41.478
What is the thing is the complete emptiness;

00:40:42.034 --> 00:40:46.200
complete emptiness. That is joy.

00:40:47.312 --> 00:40:50.002
This emptiness is filled with joy.

00:40:50.439 --> 00:40:52.039
Complete emptiness.

00:40:52.284 --> 00:40:55.184
Then you don't expect anything from anyone.

00:40:55.407 --> 00:40:59.213
And this emptiness from within is actually,

00:40:59.392 --> 00:41:04.531
gives chance to compassion and love to enter into you.

00:41:04.888 --> 00:41:07.578
Supposing there is something in a pot already,

00:41:07.757 --> 00:41:09.557
what can you pour into it?

00:41:11.071 --> 00:41:12.871
What can you give into it?

00:41:13.571 --> 00:41:16.955
So if you are completely empty within,

00:41:17.253 --> 00:41:20.863
there's nothing of this nonsense of the past and the future:

00:41:21.003 --> 00:41:24.203
the aspirations, the ambitions, all those things,

00:41:25.042 --> 00:41:28.824
and falsehood. If you just become empty,

00:41:29.063 --> 00:41:32.864
it is filled in with nothing but joy,

00:41:33.063 --> 00:41:36.775
and joy of such a eternal nature. You never asked for it;

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:40.217
you do not look forward to it.

00:41:40.356 --> 00:41:43.188
It is there, all the time.

00:41:43.764 --> 00:41:48.625
And this is what I wish today you people can feel it.

00:41:49.082 --> 00:41:51.415
As you know, the Devi's things are

00:41:52.574 --> 00:41:55.430
so very deep and subtle:

00:41:56.343 --> 00:42:02.605
how She took the form of a Mother and how She looked after

00:42:02.943 --> 00:42:06.335
Her bhaktas with love;

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:09.589
how She fought demons

00:42:10.165 --> 00:42:11.845
and also negativity.

00:42:13.458 --> 00:42:17.219
But now the demons have entered into your hearts;

00:42:17.955 --> 00:42:21.091
these false gurus have entered into your brains.

00:42:21.724 --> 00:42:24.978
Through these horrible books so many things are coming,

00:42:25.116 --> 00:42:27.469
all the time attacking you.

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:31.469
Even if you kill those demons,

00:42:31.727 --> 00:42:34.782
still they'll be lingering in your heads.

00:42:35.069 --> 00:42:37.560
They should be actually killed when they,

00:42:37.739 --> 00:42:42.552
once they are reflected into your mind, have gone away.

00:42:43.168 --> 00:42:46.917
Then only it's possible to eliminate them.

00:42:47.096 --> 00:42:51.651
Otherwise they will go away but leave their bhoots into your heads.

00:42:52.148 --> 00:42:54.996
So these negativities, which come

00:42:55.293 --> 00:42:58.725
from wrong type of following you have had,

00:42:58.884 --> 00:43:00.869
from wrong books you have been reading,

00:43:01.014 --> 00:43:02.867
also in Sahaja Yoga when you come,

00:43:03.012 --> 00:43:06.212
you can be misled by some people - it's possible.

00:43:06.484 --> 00:43:10.087
In that case also, forgive that person.

00:43:10.385 --> 00:43:13.004
That person may improve, but you may continue

00:43:13.209 --> 00:43:17.241
with the same ideas and funny things and will suddenly come up.

00:43:21.041 --> 00:43:26.945
So the quality is of compassion and love,

00:43:27.698 --> 00:43:30.231
fearlessness and courage

00:43:32.890 --> 00:43:36.274
and the complete emptiness.

00:43:37.188 --> 00:43:41.366
In this emptiness, then, you are not worried about

00:43:41.664 --> 00:43:44.917
what you have to achieve, how many people

00:43:45.136 --> 00:43:46.933
you have to gather,

00:43:47.132 --> 00:43:50.802
how many must come to Sahaja Yoga - not bothered about that.

00:43:50.926 --> 00:43:54.881
Automatically it will work out, but you would not desire for it,

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.314
and you will not hanker, "Oh my God!"

00:43:57.470 --> 00:44:00.815
say, "There is not many people, what to do?" this, that.

00:44:00.965 --> 00:44:02.807
It is good for us in a way,

00:44:03.006 --> 00:44:07.038
because where is the place in heaven for so many stupid people?

00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:14.783
So we should not run after people who are negative and useless.

00:44:15.814 --> 00:44:20.159
But we must definitely take over the people

00:44:20.359 --> 00:44:23.672
who are genuinely good.

00:44:24.038 --> 00:44:26.351
One thing more I would like to tell you,

00:44:26.589 --> 00:44:30.410
that automatically such people are dropped out in Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:30.629 --> 00:44:34.140
In one shot they will go away.

00:44:34.478 --> 00:44:37.692
They don't stay, because they don't deserve to be there.

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:40.878
They don't deserve to have the Mother's powers.

00:44:41.058 --> 00:44:46.117
So this happens in a very beautiful, subtle manner.

00:44:46.315 --> 00:44:50.771
And I see, I go late always to any program,

00:44:51.228 --> 00:44:54.712
so those who are useless just disappear.

00:44:55.029 --> 00:44:58.176
And some of them disappear half-way through,

00:44:58.393 --> 00:45:00.902
because nothing goes into their head, really,

00:45:01.101 --> 00:45:04.237
they don't understand anything, so they go away.

00:45:04.731 --> 00:45:08.635
So now the ones which are left are the real seekers of truth

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:11.837
and they get, all of them, Realization.

00:45:12.056 --> 00:45:14.211
In Sanskrit, they call it 'shayen'
619
00:45:14,369 --&gt; 00:45:18,913
- means 'selection'. This is a natural selection that takes place,

00:45:19.111 --> 00:45:24.607
and how people go away and how they come back

00:45:24.984 --> 00:45:28.071
to Sahaja Yoga, it's very interesting.

00:45:29.877 --> 00:45:33.964
This is a common happening in Sahaja Yoga, you know.

00:45:34.143 --> 00:45:35.642
You should not get upset.

00:45:35.782 --> 00:45:38.918
Now if you get too many people, say from Russia,

00:45:39.194 --> 00:45:41.071
and not so much from Switzerland,

00:45:41.191 --> 00:45:45.071
maybe you might think that way; but now it's not that bad.

00:45:47.135 --> 00:45:52.869
Then we should not worry, because we are no more Russians or Swiss.

00:45:53.663 --> 00:45:59.139
We are superhuman beings, we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:59.501 --> 00:46:03.084
Whether they are Russians or whether they are Indians

00:46:03.225 --> 00:46:06.092
or from some African land, it's all right.

00:46:07.729 --> 00:46:11.185
As long as they are Sahaja Yogis, we should be happy.

00:46:12.231 --> 00:46:16.291
If the Swiss are coming to Sahaja Yoga, we should be happy.

00:46:16.462 --> 00:46:18.462
So this attachment, in a way,

00:46:18.601 --> 00:46:21.759
is good to begin with, that you want to bring more Swiss,

00:46:22.006 --> 00:46:23.744
because you want to have company.

00:46:23.903 --> 00:46:28.387
Now you can't live with one person in a jungle,

00:46:28.684 --> 00:46:31.672
with all the others non-Sahaja Yogis, you see

00:46:31.871 --> 00:46:33.966
- difficult. So you want to have company.

00:46:34.095 --> 00:46:36.635
So you want to have more and more and more.

00:46:36.755 --> 00:46:37.964
But doesn't matter.

00:46:38.144 --> 00:46:40.344
As many as there are sufficient,

00:46:40.624 --> 00:46:44.080
and we shouldn't worry about those things, the number.

00:46:44.633 --> 00:46:48.097
But when we want to share our love,

00:46:48.355 --> 00:46:52.184
then we do feel the dearth. Not because we are Swiss,

00:46:52.323 --> 00:46:54.557
but because we cannot share.

00:46:54.756 --> 00:46:58.636
That time a new personality rises,

00:46:58.994 --> 00:47:04.093
and this new personality is the one which works.

00:47:04.687 --> 00:47:07.238
I mean we are not giving you any money;

00:47:07.398 --> 00:47:09.332
there are no awards for you.

00:47:09.541 --> 00:47:12.407
There's no way there's much encouragement,

00:47:12.577 --> 00:47:15.684
like we have your sort of a picture hanging here,

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:17.390
nothing of the kind.

00:47:17.549 --> 00:47:20.466
Can you imagine in any organization

00:47:20.585 --> 00:47:23.958
anybody would work like this, the way you work? Nobody would.

00:47:24.137 --> 00:47:27.898
They give you awards, they give you bonuses,

00:47:28.811 --> 00:47:31.390
also they give you promotions;

00:47:31.569 --> 00:47:35.212
they do all kinds of things, you see, to keep you going.

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:38.041
But we don't do anything in Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:38.657 --> 00:47:41.665
So what makes you work so hard in Sahaja Yoga,

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:44.343
what makes you spread Sahaja Yoga?

00:47:45.105 --> 00:47:47.638
Only thing is that you want to share.

00:47:48.846 --> 00:47:50.273
You can't help it,

00:47:50.472 --> 00:47:52.472
it's like a drunkard you see.

00:47:52.636 --> 00:47:54.243
If he has a bottle,

00:47:54.362 --> 00:47:57.626
he must have at least one person to share with him,

00:47:58.093 --> 00:48:04.997
because he thinks that it would be sinful,

00:48:05.181 --> 00:48:08.247
"As it is I am doing sin, why not share with somebody else?"

00:48:08.347 --> 00:48:10.614
So it would be half-half divided.

00:48:20.209 --> 00:48:28.633
But in Sahaja Yoga you share it; you want to spread it.

00:48:29.189 --> 00:48:33.268
It is because you are collective;

00:48:33.725 --> 00:48:36.392
you have become collective, that's why.

00:48:37.217 --> 00:48:41.225
You want more to come in, more to join, to enjoy.

00:48:41.443 --> 00:48:44.251
You become a very noble person, you see?

00:48:44.431 --> 00:48:46.387
Like, of course drunkards do that,

00:48:46.569 --> 00:48:50.418
but supposing somebody has a lottery, or some,

00:48:50.597 --> 00:48:54.160
he gets a very big business, he won't like to share.

00:48:55.450 --> 00:49:00.112
But you think that, "Why not? If I am so much enjoying,

00:49:00.291 --> 00:49:01.571
why not others?

00:49:02.873 --> 00:49:07.032
Why not people have the same bliss as I have?"

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:11.349
So because you become extremely noble, so noble,

00:49:11.469 --> 00:49:16.032
you work so hard, so very hard to achieve it.

00:49:16.667 --> 00:49:20.130
I mean, no words can describe My joy

00:49:20.370 --> 00:49:24.615
when I see you people working it so spontaneously.

00:49:24.834 --> 00:49:28.734
Yesterday I saw the film, the whole drama,

00:49:28.893 --> 00:49:34.786
and I was really very much amazed and touched

00:49:35.183 --> 00:49:42.020
that this Marathi music has come to Cabella.

00:49:43.131 --> 00:49:47.694
Can you imagine any Italian thinking of it?

00:49:48.449 --> 00:49:51.746
Even hundred years to come he would not think.

00:49:52.025 --> 00:49:56.491
how it has come so spontaneously and is working out?

00:49:56.650 --> 00:50:00.261
Because there is a sense of collectivity.

00:50:01.749 --> 00:50:05.142
The 'New Age' people talk of is here, no doubt.

00:50:05.313 --> 00:50:10.047
This is the New Age, and new consciousness is also there.

00:50:10.345 --> 00:50:13.545
But what is the 'new' now is the new collectivity,

00:50:14.392 --> 00:50:18.301
and that collectivity acts, that you want to spread:

00:50:18.479 --> 00:50:24.233
it acts, like your hunger, it is another kind of hunger,

00:50:24.542 --> 00:50:27.351
that you want to create more Sahaja Yogis,

00:50:27.511 --> 00:50:30.022
you want to have more brothers and sisters,

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:34.010
and you want to help them so that they could come to the Pujas

00:50:34.149 --> 00:50:37.016
and all that and become good Sahaja Yogis.

00:50:37.165 --> 00:50:42.911
Now this kind of an ambition or a joy or whatever you may call it,

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:46.820
is the whole plan, shows that in your heart,

00:50:47.078 --> 00:50:50.006
the collectivity is prospering.

00:50:50.642 --> 00:50:54.471
And that's why you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga alone,

00:50:54.689 --> 00:50:56.689
sitting in the Himalayas -no.

00:50:56.950 --> 00:50:59.017
You want to have other people.

00:50:59.372 --> 00:51:04.741
This is now the sign of how the Mother's love has taken roots

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:10.157
in your hearts and how you are all going to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:11.765 --> 00:51:16.577
Of course I'm told that somebody in Australia making money

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:19.058
- Australia has been always a problem -

00:51:19.257 --> 00:51:21.590
they are making money out of this;

00:51:21.686 --> 00:51:23.765
so I just don't know what to say,

00:51:23.928 --> 00:51:26.590
because this is, I can't understand.

00:51:26.749 --> 00:51:30.868
How can they think of making money or doing all kinds of things,

00:51:31.007 --> 00:51:36.026
and doing all kinds of asahaj things?

00:51:38.904 --> 00:51:42.784
Some sort of a headache comes up, doesn't matter.

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.513
Leave it to Me. I'll manage it,

00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:50.840
whatever it is; but you just become great lights of your Mother.

00:51:51.197 --> 00:51:54.225
That's what I have to request you tonight.

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:59.185
You have all the power flowing in you,

00:51:59.344 --> 00:52:03.562
you have the light which is enlightened,

00:52:03.721 --> 00:52:05.903
but you must expand.

00:52:07.114 --> 00:52:09.665
Expand it more and more and more,

00:52:09.924 --> 00:52:13.078
and you will be surprised what Tukarama has said,

00:52:13.356 --> 00:52:16.927
that, "I am like a small little particle of dust,

00:52:17.205 --> 00:52:20.126
and also I am the whole sky".

00:52:23.221 --> 00:52:27.904
This is what is your personality.

00:52:28.221 --> 00:52:30.700
May God bless you all.
