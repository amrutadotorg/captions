00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.960
[Starts&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:59.840
at 6:42]

00:05:49.880 --> 00:06:47.147
Shri Mataji: What about breakfast,&nbsp;
you never had anything or you had?

00:06:47.147 --> 00:06:49.022
Sahaja Yogi: Did you have something?

00:06:49.022 --> 00:06:51.920
Gregoire: Mother, we’ll have&nbsp;
lunch in about one hour.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.586
There are some new people who have just come.

00:06:54.586 --> 00:06:55.718
Maybe you can work on them.

00:06:55.718 --> 00:06:55.741
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:06:55.741 --> 00:06:57.720
Sahaja Yogi: Would you like some tea,&nbsp;
Mother? Or something, the brunch is ready.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:04.560
Shri Mataji: I’ll have some tea. Did you&nbsp;
have something to eat in the morning?

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.120
Did have.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.137
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:07:07.137 --> 00:07:08.788
Shri Mataji: Those who did not, have to have.

00:07:08.788 --> 00:07:55.001
You want to have something?&nbsp;
All right. What do you want?

00:07:55.001 --> 00:07:55.036
[Unclear conversations in the back]

00:07:55.036 --> 00:07:59.280
You are the new people who have come?

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.952
Yes, we taught Kundalini. Hum?&nbsp;
This one is an old one of mine.

00:08:00.952 --> 00:08:01.161
[Cut in the audio]

00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:01.178
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:08:01.178 --> 00:08:30.886
Seeker: [Unclear] you are in your heart.

00:08:30.886 --> 00:08:35.192
Shri Mataji: No, no, no,&nbsp;
no. You are so many things.

00:08:35.192 --> 00:08:37.000
You are not only your heart.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:44.400
There are so many things, you&nbsp;
see? You are much more than that.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:50.160
Everything, of course, surrounds heart.&nbsp;
But heart is a very big thing, you know.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:56.583
What we think of heart is a very&nbsp;
limited stuff. It is a very big thing.

00:08:56.583 --> 00:09:00.091
Seeker: Yes. Now everything seems to come&nbsp;
back to the heart since I was in [unclear]

00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:00.672
Shri Mataji: Yes, it’s true.

00:09:00.672 --> 00:09:02.747
Seeker: It seems to come back to the heart.

00:09:02.747 --> 00:09:06.240
Shri Mataji: No doubt. Sincerity&nbsp;
is in the heart, no doubt.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.800
But it has to throw lights&nbsp;
on something else, isn’t it?

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.880
You must express your sincerity in your life.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.640
I mean, if it is just there,&nbsp;
hanging in air, then what’s the use?

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:25.240
It has to work on something.&nbsp;
It has to reflect on something.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.760
It has to show its results.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:33.180
So, you must have a reflector of that type.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.827
Seeker: In action.

00:09:35.827 --> 00:09:54.880
Shri Mataji: Yes, in action&nbsp;
in behaviour and everything.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.320
Take it from the book if&nbsp;
you want to. All right. Yes,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.120
yes.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:15:28.960
Frank [unsure]&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.520
is very happy, I tell you.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.600
Some music amongst the Sahaja Yogis, you see.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:57.000
That’s one side where we, in&nbsp;
London, is our music party.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.960
We don’t sing and we don’t have&nbsp;
– music is very important because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.680
that carries the vibrations much better, you see.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:15.500
And I think we should somehow, compose&nbsp;
some poems and put them into tunes and –

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:23.620
Patricia can compose it and you can&nbsp;
really have some nice music played.

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.720
And music is very good, you see.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:40.160
I would say sounds. Sound is one&nbsp;
of the carriers of vibrations.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:47.880
Our music is organised sound,&nbsp;
organised for evolution.

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:55.080
And the confusion about organised&nbsp;
and disorganised is so complete

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.840
that we don’t understand&nbsp;
the thing that is organised,

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:07.520
works out for our creation&nbsp;
and for our construction,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:12.440
can be disorganised and can&nbsp;
work out the other way round.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:19.560
Because of this confusion, people don’t&nbsp;
understand different things, you see.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.040
Like the other day, as I was&nbsp;
telling you, that somebody asked me,

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.120
“What is the difference between&nbsp;
a prostitute and a housewife?”

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.880
I said, “Very nice”. I&nbsp;
mean, something like asking,

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.800
“What is the difference between the&nbsp;
fire that burns the house and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.440
fire that is lit in the hearth where you cook?”

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.600
So, it is so confused, you see,&nbsp;
this is the time of confusion.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:48.800
Modernization means confusion, I think,&nbsp;
because we are confused about everything.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.240
All of our values are confused.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.040
All of our fundamental things are confused.

00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:57.920
And simple things we do not understand, you&nbsp;
see. It has become really a confused stuff.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:04.560
But to overcome confusion, first of&nbsp;
all, we must see the different things.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.680
Then they integrate them properly.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:13.240
That’s the only way we can bring forth&nbsp;
the chaotic conditions under control,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:15.920
and can have some integrated things.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:20.720
So there is a difference between&nbsp;
integration and confusion.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:25.000
People confuse integration with confusion.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:34.040
So you have to integrate all these seven&nbsp;
chakras and their seven qualities within you.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:37.360
But not to confuse.

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.840
And this confusion can be only&nbsp;
overcome through vibrations.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.280
Otherwise, you cannot overcome it.

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:49.920
Because first of all, you have to have&nbsp;
something absolute to take out your confusion.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.640
If you do not have something&nbsp;
absolute, then you are confused.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:58.640
Somebody said, “What, what is there&nbsp;
to have children and not to beat them?

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.000
” No, what it’s, there’s a confusion.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.960
“What’s wrong in this? ”&nbsp;
and “What’s wrong in that? “

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:07.160
It’s all out of confusion you ask such questions.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:13.760
If you can feel the vibrations, if you&nbsp;
can have a rapport with the Absolute,

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.120
then you can understand that this&nbsp;
is absolute and this is a relative.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.760
And relative is not to be confused with absolute.

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.920
That’s how confusion can be over.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:30.600
And it is inevitable, confusion is inevitable&nbsp;
when there is at random growth, you see,

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.560
this side more and that side less,&nbsp;
and this side more and that side less.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.320
So, confusion is the only&nbsp;
outcome of such a growth,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:44.320
you see, which is at random without&nbsp;
any idea of the Whole, you see.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:50.000
It is malignant. It grows on itself&nbsp;
and then it is killing others.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:58.600
And that’s how the confusion starts.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.880
So the complete integration has to come in.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:07.400
All these powers, say sound power now,&nbsp;
as I said, there is power of light.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.800
And there is power of water.

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.720
And there is power of this earth.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.520
And there is power of air, firmament.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:24.600
All these powers are to be&nbsp;
brought into integration together.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.840
How do you get it? How do you do it?

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.600
By holding their reins into your hands.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.200
Now how do you hold their reins?

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.360
The reins are the things that go&nbsp;
absolutely in the centre of it, you see,

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:43.120
like a rib inside or you can&nbsp;
say like the spinal cord inside.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.000
So, you catch all of those reins in your hands,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.800
and that’s how you remove the confusion.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.400
And this is the best way you can&nbsp;
do it. How do you hold the reins?

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.240
Again, the question comes in, how do you hold?

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:01.440
By Realisation, all the reins&nbsp;
come into your hands. Absolutely.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.800
You get them into your hands and&nbsp;
you can use them if you want.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:10.040
Try it. It’s very easy to try sometimes.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:16.160
How you can control sound and&nbsp;
how you can control elements?

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:17.840
It’s very easy to control them.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:24.160
Now see this, fire, you&nbsp;
can control this fire also.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.720
It also acts all the time. It’s there.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:31.480
Just it is acting all the time when I’m&nbsp;
talking to you. And it’s working out.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.200
And it catches hold of all&nbsp;
the spirits that are around,

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:40.200
and just attracts them towards&nbsp;
itself and then burns them out.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.200
It’s happening. You don’t&nbsp;
know, but it’s happening there.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:49.440
It works out this way. Without&nbsp;
your knowledge, it is being done.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.120
So because the reins are in one&nbsp;
hand, so they are working it out.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.400
I don’t have to do anything. They know their jobs.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.880
Once they are with me, they get enlightened.

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:02.880
They go on to their reins and they start working,&nbsp;
because I’m controlling supposing the rain

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.600
and they get in touch with their&nbsp;
reins. So it starts working like that.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:14.560
It’s that simple, but it is so&nbsp;
fantastic, that one cannot believe it.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.960
But as you have seen Kundalini rising,&nbsp;
you have seen vibrations coming.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.480
You have seen people emitting vibrations.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:25.200
You have seen diseases being cured. Some&nbsp;
of you have seen cancer being cured.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.760
So, gradually, you must know that all&nbsp;
these things can happen to you, all of you.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.440
It can happen to you, and you can work it out.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.520
So, the powers are tremendous, no doubt,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.440
but actually the so-called&nbsp;
power of yours becomes zero.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:42.240
Because the powers of God start flowing&nbsp;
through you, then what is your power?

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:49.040
This simple little ‘ego’ power? It goes away.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:54.160
Not only, but it troubles you if it&nbsp;
is there, it gives you a headache.

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.860
So, it’s better not to have.

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.280
[Laughter]

00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:58.440
Yes.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:09.880
So, what other music are you going to? Hum?

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:18.360
Who else sings? You sing? Does she? No, yes. Sure.

00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:25.263
I think, a little bit this way.&nbsp;
Who else is going to sing to Me?

00:24:25.263 --> 00:24:25.342
Sahaja Yogini: I don’t sing&nbsp;
Christmas choirs, Mother.

00:24:25.342 --> 00:24:28.681
Shri Mataji: Well if you might. I would&nbsp;
love to hear that. It’s beautiful.

00:24:28.681 --> 00:24:29.154
Sahaja Yogini: [Unclear].

00:24:29.154 --> 00:24:35.752
Shri Mataji: Ah. All of you know? Which one?

00:24:35.752 --> 00:24:35.777
Sahaja Yogini: [Unclear].

00:24:35.777 --> 00:24:35.787
[Laughter]

00:24:35.787 --> 00:24:41.570
Shri Mataji: I mean, commonly&nbsp;
one. Hark the angels?

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:41.587
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:24:41.587 --> 00:24:43.840
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:49.360
‘Hark! The Herald Angels&nbsp;
Sing’. Let’s have that one.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:57.847
Patricia, can you play that?

00:24:57.847 --> 00:24:57.867
Patricia: [Unclear].

00:24:57.867 --> 00:25:00.420
Shri Mataji: Just try. Try.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:00.667
Patricia: I can give it a try.

00:25:00.667 --> 00:25:03.520
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, you can, you try&nbsp;
everything, it will work out. I can tell you.

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.280
[Laughter]

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.240
You played very well, Patricia. I can’t&nbsp;
believe that you have forgotten playing.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:12.040
It’s beautiful what you have&nbsp;
done; very clear, very clear.

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:15.440
Every note was very clear, beautiful it was.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.240
And you kept the rhythm all&nbsp;
right, and it’s beautiful.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.760
May God bless you. I’m so happy.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.840
And now you are going to&nbsp;
increase your ability to do that.

00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:27.280
She is a very great genius, you&nbsp;
know. She knew this very well.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.720
She lost it, but she’s got back again,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:37.920
I think. So thank you very much&nbsp;
and let’s have it now, come along.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.809
Patricia: Some carols?

00:25:38.809 --> 00:25:54.200
Shri Mataji: Yes, some carols, let’s play. This&nbsp;
is the time, you know, it’s the Christmas time.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:58.240
What is that? Is that?

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:04.376
[Piano concert and Silent night carol]

00:26:04.376 --> 00:26:06.960
Silent night, o&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:29.640
holy night.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:27:31.960
All is calm, all is bright.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:59.756
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child .

00:27:59.755 --> 00:28:01.445
Holy Infant so tender and mild.

00:28:01.445 --> 00:28:02.753
Sleep in heavenly peace.

00:28:02.754 --> 00:28:04.171
Sleep in heavenly peace…

00:28:04.171 --> 00:28:04.880
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:09.000
Jesus is to be reborn here,&nbsp;
in the Agnya, for all of you.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:17.640
And that’s what we have to do, is to&nbsp;
make a proper place for him to be reborn.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:24.200
He had no proper place where he was born.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:34.480
But He does not care for what&nbsp;
kind of material place it was.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:43.400
But he does care for spiritual&nbsp;
atmosphere within yourself.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:49.360
And He can be reborn within all of us.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:29:00.320
And that is very important, because he is&nbsp;
the support of Sahaja Yoga, of this universe.

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:15.160
And without him, nothing is possible.

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.040
People have just done no justice to him.

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:28.040
I mean, they have really re-crucified&nbsp;
him every time they started a new cult.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:35.080
Now,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:42.840
let’s have the other one. Hum.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:58.040
Any other one?

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:03.240
Shri Mataji: Hum,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.764
who is that?

00:30:05.764 --> 00:30:05.787
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear].

00:30:05.787 --> 00:30:11.005
Shri Mataji: Which one? Which one?

00:30:11.005 --> 00:30:14.667
Gregoire: It is just a suggestion. After&nbsp;
that, we can sing the ‘Hail Mary’ in French.

00:30:14.667 --> 00:30:22.207
Shri Mataji: All right. So, which one is this one?

00:30:22.207 --> 00:30:22.227
Patricia: [Unclear].

00:30:22.227 --> 00:30:27.960
Shri Mataji: No, you, you just start. Tell&nbsp;
her, you tell her. She’ll accompany you.

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:55.960
[Piano concert&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:07.920
and carol]

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:54.760
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.840
Loudly.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:40.492
Oh, thank you.

00:32:40.492 --> 00:32:40.520
[Someone seems to be crying]

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:57.840
What’s that, Peggy? It’s all right.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:23.667
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]

00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:27.000
Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.960
Gregoire, you and she, sing that.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.661
Does she know how to play?

00:33:34.661 --> 00:33:34.680
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.280
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:44.640
You come along here, Gregoire.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:50.360
It will be all right, Peggy, you needed it.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.939
Lots of bottling up is there,&nbsp;
has to come out, harsh.

00:33:52.939 --> 00:33:52.980
“Je vous salue Marie, pleine de grâce.

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:53.006
Le Seigneur est avec vous.

00:33:53.006 --> 00:33:53.047
Vous êtes bénie entre toutes les femmes

00:33:53.047 --> 00:33:53.096
Et Jésus, le fruit de vos entrailles, est béni.

00:33:53.096 --> 00:33:53.124
Sainte Marie, Mère de Dieu,

00:33:53.124 --> 00:33:53.158
Priez pour nous pauvres pécheurs,

00:33:53.158 --> 00:33:53.199
Maintenant et à l’heure de notre mort.

00:33:53.199 --> 00:33:53.207
Amen “

00:33:53.207 --> 00:34:20.720
[Translation: “Hail Mary, full of grace.&nbsp;
The Lord is with thee. Blessed art&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:50.920
thou among women And blessed is the fruit of&nbsp;
thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, Pray&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:50.920 --> 00:35:04.636
for us sinners, Now and at&nbsp;
the hour of our death. Amen”]

00:35:04.636 --> 00:35:06.320
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:22.107
Beautiful. Nice.

00:35:22.107 --> 00:35:22.117
[Applause]

00:35:22.117 --> 00:35:22.137
Very beautiful. Hum.

00:35:22.137 --> 00:35:22.157
Patricia: [Unclear].

00:35:22.157 --> 00:35:22.184
Shri Mataji: What’s this?

00:35:22.184 --> 00:35:26.280
Gregoire: After this, we could all sing&nbsp;
Mother. It is a ‘Jai Jagadambe, Jai Jagadambe’.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.773
Then everybody can take, it fast.

00:35:27.773 --> 00:35:30.440
Shri Mataji: Yes. Let’s&nbsp;
see. Let’s have it that way.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.220
Can you?

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.990
Gregoire: You know the tune. You&nbsp;
want to play the tune on the piano?

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:52.982
Patricia: [Unclear].

00:35:52.982 --> 00:35:55.200
Shri Mataji: Hum. Which one is this?

00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:01.160
Gregoire: We have some deep&nbsp;
ones at the ashram. I mean,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:10.097
it’s the one that Modi was trying to&nbsp;
teach us in the train from Hyderabad.

00:36:10.097 --> 00:36:10.107
[Laughter]

00:36:10.107 --> 00:36:10.137
Sahaja Yogi: No, that’s not.

00:36:10.137 --> 00:36:27.918
Shri Mataji: Hum. Then call the Indians with you&nbsp;
in this. Yes [Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi].

00:36:27.918 --> 00:36:29.747
Shri Mataji: Hum. We have it written down?

00:36:29.747 --> 00:36:36.560
Sahaja Yogi: No, no, no, no.&nbsp;
I mean, I have to make it up.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:42.427
Gregoire: The tune is very simple. I&nbsp;
mean, I sing it once. So, we can sing-

00:36:42.427 --> 00:36:45.520
Shri Mataji: You can tell first&nbsp;
of all, Patricia, so that.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:57.520
Sahaja Yogi: Very important thing is that&nbsp;
we sing together. So, it goes like that.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:01.520
Jai Jagadmabe, jai Jagadambe,&nbsp;
Jai Ganeshaji ki Ma Ambe.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.047
[Sahaja Yogis repeat]

00:37:03.047 --> 00:37:05.229
Jai Lakshakari Adi Shakti Ambe

00:37:05.229 --> 00:37:07.265
Jai Nirmala Nishkalanka Ambe

00:37:07.265 --> 00:37:11.265
Jai Jagadmabe, jai Jagadambe,&nbsp;
Jai Ganeshaji ki Ma Ambe.

00:37:11.265 --> 00:37:12.792
[Sahaja Yogis repeat]

00:37:12.792 --> 00:37:14.828
Jai Gurupriya Gurumurti Ambe

00:37:14.829 --> 00:37:16.793
Jai Parashakti Bhavani Ambe

00:37:16.792 --> 00:37:18.319
[Sahaja Yogis repeat]

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:22.320
Jai Jagadmabe, jai Jagadambe,&nbsp;
Jai Ganeshaji ki Ma Ambe.

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:27.520
Shri&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.440
Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.880
I’ll tell her how to play the tune.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:57.440
I think I might be able to tell her.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:23.320
Patricia: Yes, how&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:27.360
nice!

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:40.927
[It seems that Shri Mataji goes to sit&nbsp;
at the piano to look for the notes]

00:39:40.927 --> 00:39:50.277
Shri Mataji: I can try just&nbsp;
on harmonium [unclear].

00:39:50.277 --> 00:39:51.560
It’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:39:51.560 --> 00:40:27.320
all right Gregoire,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:58.240
what I did?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:22.880
Hum?

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:27.142
Gregoire: I don’t know,&nbsp;
vibrations wise, certainly.

00:42:27.142 --> 00:42:27.164
[Laughter]

00:42:27.163 --> 00:42:32.543
Shri Mataji: You should tell me&nbsp;
otherwise. Tune wise, was that all right?

00:42:32.543 --> 00:42:32.747
Let’s see now. She notes it.

00:42:32.747 --> 00:42:32.775
[Sahaja Yogis sing together]

00:42:32.775 --> 00:42:57.120
Shri Mataji: Let’s see now.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:19.760
His technique is al right,&nbsp;
be careful with the notes.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:27.628
This is Modi. Modi is a teacher, you&nbsp;
see, then you’ll know how to say it.

00:43:27.628 --> 00:43:29.320
[Laughter]

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:54.439
Now let’s sing. I’ll tell you where you go&nbsp;
wrong. Then, let her take the note, you see.

00:43:54.439 --> 00:43:54.446
Logana?

00:43:54.446 --> 00:43:54.480
[Shri Mataji sings along at 43:46]

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.280
It is not so slow, you see, it&nbsp;
has to be in the same rhythm.

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:16.861
So, the second part becomes slower. That’s why.

00:44:16.861 --> 00:44:16.880
[Shri Mataji sings]

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:27.040
All right?

00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:28.874
[Unclear] Play it on.

00:44:28.874 --> 00:44:31.320
[Sahaja Yogis sing together]

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:44.200
Ah, now it’s better.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:47.200
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi].

00:44:47.200 --> 00:45:28.479
[Sahaja Yogis sing together]

00:45:28.479 --> 00:45:33.880
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi].

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:41.701
Play the higher tunes now.

00:45:41.701 --> 00:45:41.720
[Shri Mataji sings]

00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:45.499
What is it? I don’t know. What are you singing?

00:45:45.499 --> 00:45:45.538
Sahaja Yogi: I cannot sing Shri Mataji.

00:45:45.538 --> 00:45:45.548
[Laughter]

00:45:45.548 --> 00:45:48.680
Shri Mataji What are you, which&nbsp;
one are you singing now? Which one?

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:54.180
Ah, clearly. Now, I have to sing&nbsp;
to myself. That is too much.

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.920
[Laughter]

00:45:55.920 --> 00:46:16.590
It’s a big joke. Let her have the&nbsp;
book. You see, they can do it.

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:16.616
[Conversation in Marathi].

00:46:16.616 --> 00:46:28.093
Sahaja Yogi: Want us is to&nbsp;
pick up the names, Mother.

00:46:28.093 --> 00:46:32.451
[Conversation in Marathi].
