WEBVTT

00:00.610 --> 00:32.070
Shri Mataji: And he is buying – he is just
buying Rolls Royce’s and he has got three

00:32.070 --> 00:35.350
airplanes; I think, I don’t know.

00:35.350 --> 00:48.489
I mean such a fraud and such a horrible gangster
he was!

00:48.489 --> 00:50.720
And he talked through his hat.

00:50.720 --> 00:54.600
I don’t know what he talked.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.670
Nonsense!

00:57.670 --> 01:03.620
I just wanted to test him and I saw him and
I wanted to know what is he up to and I found

01:03.620 --> 01:07.760
out that he was a dirty man.

01:07.760 --> 01:22.740
He was doing all dirty tricks with there – he
was like a homosexual.

01:22.740 --> 01:40.500
Most of his disciples get Aids also because
he spoils their private parts and things like

01:40.500 --> 01:43.730
that.

01:43.730 --> 01:56.101
And in
my presence, I’m surprised about you, but

01:56.101 --> 02:08.340
normally they faint and they just become like
stones in my presence, the disciples.

02:08.340 --> 02:15.040
They can’t stand Me at all.

02:15.040 --> 02:18.470
Once Yogi Mahajan told Me he wants to bring
three of them for my program.

02:18.470 --> 02:20.319
I told him, “Don’t bring them”.

02:20.319 --> 02:21.319
He won’t listen.

02:21.319 --> 02:22.319
He brought them.

02:22.319 --> 02:26.650
And I was sitting like this [in an armchair]
and at least two hundred feet away, in a big

02:26.650 --> 02:28.590
Delhi program, you see, thousands coming.

02:28.590 --> 02:30.290
He brought them, three of them.

02:30.290 --> 02:34.849
And as soon as they looked at Me, they fainted
and they had become just like stones.

02:34.849 --> 02:36.849
And nobody could lift them.

02:36.849 --> 02:37.900
We didn’t know what to do.

02:37.900 --> 02:43.080
And the program started very late because
they were actually, like, you see, you take

02:43.080 --> 02:48.000
a stick with that, you see, they were thrown
out like that.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.349
Otherwise, we did three sticks had to be pushed
on them, they seemed to be taken out like

02:54.349 --> 02:58.450
a- you see, as you jack up the stone like
that.

02:58.450 --> 03:09.380
And they were kept outside just like stones
outside and then they came to consciousness

03:09.380 --> 03:16.480
later on and went away.

03:16.480 --> 03:33.360
[Shri Mataji laughs]
How to say?

03:33.360 --> 03:44.610
Jacked up like that!

03:44.610 --> 03:47.430
Yes!

03:47.430 --> 04:02.190
And

04:02.190 --> 04:17.239
in his ashram, Yogi Mahajan wrote: “no Rajneesh
disciples allowed”.

04:17.239 --> 04:20.139
So they got very angry.

04:20.139 --> 04:28.150
And so, he said, “All right, come in, see,
look at this photograph”.

04:28.150 --> 04:33.830
And they just fainted.

04:33.830 --> 04:44.639
[Laughter]
And then, you see, they forget also what had

04:44.639 --> 04:45.639
happened to them.

04:45.639 --> 04:48.770
They just remember they saw the photograph
and they faint and they don’t know after

04:48.770 --> 04:49.770
that anything.

04:49.770 --> 04:53.180
And then they are thrown on the streets.

04:53.180 --> 04:54.979
They just find them on the street.

04:54.979 --> 04:57.080
What to do?

04:57.080 --> 05:07.039
I mean, we just can’t do anything about
them.

05:07.039 --> 05:18.689
Last September when I went there, they were
all going to Oregon, you see, so somewhere

05:18.689 --> 05:26.169
– I mean – leftovers were there, all miserable
looking: on the wheelchair, all in a bad condition

05:26.169 --> 05:40.639
were carried by people, by planes.

05:40.639 --> 06:07.639
But now it is practically becoming absolutely
sort of localized, dying race there, all of

06:07.639 --> 06:13.719
them are there, just this.

06:13.719 --> 06:25.909
You see, in America we have all kinds of horrible
bhoots gone there.

06:25.909 --> 06:28.569
And that’s why this new disease – what
you call that one?

06:28.569 --> 06:30.219
Sahaja Yogini: Alzheimer disease.

06:30.219 --> 06:31.460
Shri Mataji: Al?

06:31.460 --> 06:32.710
Sahaja Yogini: Alzheimer.

06:32.710 --> 06:34.360
Shri Mataji: Alzheimer disease.

06:34.360 --> 06:46.300
It’s a new disease where people get insane
before the age of 40 years.

06:46.300 --> 06:59.899
[Marie translates with difficulty the name]
That’s the discoverer.

06:59.899 --> 07:06.689
So, after Aids, now this is coming in.

07:06.689 --> 07:19.889
So, Americans are not going to be destroyed
by Russians but by diseases.

07:19.889 --> 07:28.809
And Russians will be destroyed by- what you
call- parapsychology.

07:28.809 --> 07:35.400
They’ll have no chance to use missiles.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.279
That’s what it is.

07:37.279 --> 07:40.370
They should take to Sahaja Yoga.

07:40.370 --> 07:49.289
You don’t know what an important thing you
have got in your hand.

07:49.289 --> 07:51.969
How great it is.

07:51.969 --> 07:57.559
Why should you think of these dirty people,
useless, anti-God, anti-Christ?

07:57.559 --> 08:04.860
Try
to save yourself.

08:04.860 --> 08:15.399
A very few who are saved out of Rajnesh, I
must tell you, so be careful.

08:15.399 --> 08:21.409
Beat yourself with shoes and him and yourself.

08:21.409 --> 08:34.219
It’s a dying race now.

08:34.219 --> 08:48.470
Most of the gurus are finished now practically,
about, nearly, thanks to Sahaja Yoga.

08:48.470 --> 08:50.829
But how many are going to be saved out of
them?

08:50.829 --> 09:04.170
I don’t know, because they’re so much
mesmerized.

09:04.170 --> 09:13.000
So, we have to talk vehemently about them,
denouncing them that, “What had happened

09:13.000 --> 09:14.410
to me when I was with him.

09:14.410 --> 09:15.930
This has happened, that has happened”.

09:15.930 --> 09:31.190
You must write it down and give a full account
of what he did to you, how

09:31.190 --> 09:39.500
you were exhausted.

09:39.500 --> 09:42.690
And how Sahaja Yoga has saved you, you see,
write letters.

09:42.690 --> 09:49.610
It will come very handy, you see, it will
come very handy.

09:49.610 --> 09:53.959
All those who have been to some groups like
that should write a letter how Sahaja Yoga

09:53.959 --> 09:57.579
has saved them.

09:57.579 --> 10:10.340
The sooner the better.

10:10.340 --> 10:11.340
All right.

10:11.340 --> 10:16.639
Now I’ll take your leave and again tomorrow
we have a program and a conference.

10:16.639 --> 10:24.310
I hope everything goes well with it.

10:24.310 --> 10:32.800
So, will you keep that material here with
you in this place?

10:32.800 --> 10:36.079
Alexandre: This material that you bought today?

10:36.079 --> 10:37.550
Well, we can keep it here, yes.

10:37.550 --> 10:40.839
But they’re leaving by plane so we’ll
drive them to the airport.

10:40.839 --> 10:50.121
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, you see, what I’m
saying that some material I have to take to

10:50.121 --> 10:52.370
India, I’ll leave it with you, we don’t
want it just now.

10:52.370 --> 10:53.370
Alexandre: All right, as you like Mother.

10:53.370 --> 10:54.370
Shri Mataji: All right?

10:54.370 --> 10:55.370
Alexandre: All right, no problem, we’ll
take care of it.

10:55.370 --> 10:58.519
Shri Mataji: All right.

10:58.519 --> 11:01.740
Give it to them, somebody be responsible
Alexandre: [In French: Martine, can you give

11:01.740 --> 11:02.740
me the fabric]
Shri Mataji: Martine.

11:02.740 --> 11:03.850
Alexandre: [In French: What Shri Mataji has
chosen, we’ll keep it today.]

11:03.850 --> 11:04.850
Martine: Which one?

11:04.850 --> 11:05.850
Sorry.

11:05.850 --> 11:06.850
Marie: [In French: The cotton one, the heaviest
roll.]

11:06.850 --> 11:07.850
Shri Mataji, aside: Only the- [Name] you know,
you go with her.

11:07.850 --> 11:08.850
The nine-ten yards’ one.

11:08.850 --> 11:09.850
The one that [inaudible] that one.

11:09.850 --> 11:10.850
And the two black ones.

11:10.850 --> 11:11.850
One is four yards and another is three yards.

11:11.850 --> 11:13.750
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, maybe we can give
to some journalists a little bit later, the

11:13.750 --> 11:33.990
French edition of the Advent?

11:33.990 --> 11:40.079
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon?

11:40.079 --> 11:49.110
Michel C.: Perhaps, we don’t know, perhaps
it is possible to have the French issue of

11:49.110 --> 11:50.110
the Advent.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.110
Perhaps tomorrow in the morning.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.129
Should we give it to the journalists if we
can have those issues?

11:52.129 --> 11:55.370
Shri Mataji: Not so soon.

11:55.370 --> 11:57.939
Sahaja Yogi: Not so soon.

11:57.939 --> 12:03.509
Shri Mataji: You should have an official release
of it and we should call Ambav for that release.

12:03.509 --> 12:04.550
Sahaja Yogi: All right.

12:04.550 --> 12:07.769
Shri Mataji: You see, next time when I come
here [in June].

12:07.769 --> 12:12.540
They should be invited; people should be invited
for the release of the book.

12:12.540 --> 12:14.970
We should invite all the dignitaries and all
that and Mr.

12:14.970 --> 12:16.370
Ambav to preside it.

12:16.370 --> 12:19.519
Make it a big issue out of this.

12:19.519 --> 12:21.430
And also call the Doodoo D.N for that.

12:21.430 --> 12:22.430
Sahaja Yogi: Also?

12:22.430 --> 12:23.930
Shri Mataji: Also, Doodoo D.N from America.

12:23.930 --> 12:24.930
Sahaja Yogi: Ah.

12:24.930 --> 12:27.510
Shri Mataji: I will tell him also.

12:27.510 --> 12:31.180
So, fix a date, say Friday, Saturday.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.279
Sunday we’ll have puja in the morning.

12:33.279 --> 12:38.020
Sunday night we can have this program here
in Paris.

12:38.020 --> 12:39.860
Michel C.: The 13th.

12:39.860 --> 12:47.999
Shri Mataji: That could be.

12:47.999 --> 12:56.029
Or we could have it earlier one day.

12:56.029 --> 12:58.129
Like we are having Thursday-Friday program.

12:58.129 --> 13:04.540
So, we can have it on – say – Tuesday.

13:04.540 --> 13:05.890
Tuesday I won’t be here?

13:05.890 --> 13:09.040
Michel C.: Tuesday, no, Shri Mataji.

13:09.040 --> 13:12.080
Wednesday and Thursday
Shri Mataji: No, no.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.670
Thursday and Friday.

13:13.670 --> 13:14.740
No, no.

13:14.740 --> 13:16.699
Wednesday and Thursday.

13:16.699 --> 13:19.089
Wednesday and Thursday, we’ll have programs.

13:19.089 --> 13:23.199
So, we can have on Tuesday this opening.

13:23.199 --> 13:26.319
Tuesday is a good day.

13:26.319 --> 13:27.649
This opening we can have earlier.

13:27.649 --> 13:32.810
So, we can ask them, all these people can
to our program later on.

13:32.810 --> 13:35.850
Make it a big show out of it, you see.

13:35.850 --> 13:44.660
For this book Advent we should have a big
program we should call Ambav to be there.

13:44.660 --> 13:52.480
And you can also give him the tape of Dr Navin
Singh from India, for him to listen to it,

13:52.480 --> 13:53.759
you see, to listen to it.

13:53.759 --> 13:55.430
And then we should get Doodoo D.N.

13:55.430 --> 13:59.949
Ambav [name unsure] for these things and he
should invite other people, you see, for the

13:59.949 --> 14:01.160
book to be released.

14:01.160 --> 14:09.540
Because English book was released by the Ambassador
of – no, by High Commissioner Mr Singh,

14:09.540 --> 14:11.740
from I.P.

14:11.740 --> 14:13.309
Singh, I.P.

14:13.309 --> 14:14.649
Singh from England.

14:14.649 --> 14:17.010
He released the book.

14:17.010 --> 14:21.550
So, this second, this French should be released
by Ambav.

14:21.550 --> 14:22.759
I think that’s a good idea.

14:22.759 --> 14:26.059
So, first, you’ll build up with him all
these things and then he can be called to

14:26.059 --> 14:29.850
release the book.

14:29.850 --> 14:33.579
And then you get all the dignitaries that
day, invite them.

14:33.579 --> 14:40.180
So, what will happen, that next day when we
have the program, Wednesday and Thursday,

14:40.180 --> 14:41.180
we can have them there.

14:41.180 --> 14:42.180
So, I can come on Tuesday [in June].

14:42.180 --> 14:43.500
What will be the date on Tuesday?

14:43.500 --> 15:05.779
Alexandre: On Tuesday it will be the- [In
French: Let’s see, Friday is 28, Thursday

15:05.779 --> 15:09.420
is 27.]

15:09.420 --> 15:16.699
Martine: [In French: 25.]

15:16.699 --> 15:20.339
Michel: Twenty-five.

15:20.339 --> 15:22.160
25th.

15:22.160 --> 15:31.259
[Shri Mataji checks her schedule.]

15:31.259 --> 15:40.720
Shri Mataji: You see, we’ll have to cancel
Spain then.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.930
The 25th you said, isn’t it?

15:42.930 --> 15:44.889
It was Spain and France.

15:44.889 --> 15:50.319
Or then we’ll have to do Spain earlier.

15:50.319 --> 15:56.519
Can I have a pen?

15:56.519 --> 16:12.720
We can do Spain earlier, so, we could have
it on the 22d and 23d, 24th, you see.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.430
And this is 25th?

16:14.430 --> 16:17.399
All right, we can have it 21rst.

16:17.399 --> 16:23.319
We can start 21rst, let us say, because I’ll
want these days either here.

16:23.319 --> 16:29.549
So, this is from the 25th onwards, starting
from the 25th..

16:29.549 --> 16:31.610
– 21rst, 22d, 23d; yes, three.

16:31.610 --> 16:38.709
And 25th to ?
Michel C.: 30th because it is the Sunday of

16:38.709 --> 16:40.569
the puja.

16:40.569 --> 16:43.369
Shri Mataji: 30th.

16:43.369 --> 16:45.240
All right?

16:45.240 --> 16:51.269
So, you fix up 25th as the day for the opening
of the –

16:51.269 --> 16:59.380
Michel C.: On the Tuesday so, the first day
of Your [in June]…

16:59.380 --> 17:03.699
Shri Mataji: Opening, yes.

17:03.699 --> 17:06.140
The opening of Grégoire’s book we can say.

17:06.140 --> 17:07.140
All right.

17:07.140 --> 17:08.140
That’s it.

17:08.140 --> 17:09.140
Sahaja Yogi: The presence of Grégoire will
be necessary?

17:09.140 --> 17:13.579
Sahaja Yogi: The presence of Grégoire will
be necessary?

17:13.579 --> 17:17.419
Shri Mataji: He will be there.

17:17.419 --> 17:18.419
Then Holland is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

17:18.419 --> 17:19.419
All right?

17:19.419 --> 17:29.110
Then I’ll go to India [unsure]
Alexandre: Mother the book is supposed to

17:29.110 --> 17:32.159
be distributed from the 15th of May.

17:32.159 --> 17:35.720
Michel C.: Shri Mataji, the book is supposed
to-

17:35.720 --> 17:36.820
Shri Mataji: What is it?

17:36.820 --> 17:39.570
Michel C.: Be printed in two weeks and …
Shri Mataji: Now, what is it?

17:39.570 --> 17:46.570
Michel C.: In the books shop son the fifteen
of May.

17:46.570 --> 17:51.750
Shri Mataji: No, you can’t do that.

17:51.750 --> 17:52.750
What is the hurry?

17:52.750 --> 17:57.809
Michel C.: Because as soon as the book is
printed, they give it to the bookshops.

17:57.809 --> 18:01.990
Shri Mataji: No, you tell him that, we want
to do this, it will help you.

18:01.990 --> 18:02.990
You see, there is no harm.

18:02.990 --> 18:04.640
You tell them that it’s all right.

18:04.640 --> 18:09.440
You just tell them that, “If you wait, you
see, then it will work out “.

18:09.440 --> 18:10.710
Michel C.: All right.

18:10.710 --> 18:12.630
Shri Mataji: Try to tell them.

18:12.630 --> 18:15.760
[To the two Sahaja Yogis] Now, what I will
say, now one thing, that all of you being

18:15.760 --> 18:17.030
right-sided, you’ll always think of problems.

18:17.030 --> 18:20.990
Now don’t think of problems, that’s a
very bad habit.

18:20.990 --> 18:25.390
And the all-alternate problems you will think
of, is another very, very bad habit, “This

18:25.390 --> 18:26.580
will happen, that will”.

18:26.580 --> 18:27.620
Nothing will happen!

18:27.620 --> 18:31.840
You just see that how you do it.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.059
All right?

18:34.059 --> 18:35.169
Spontaneously.

18:35.169 --> 18:39.559
Nobody should think of problems otherwise
your Agnya will go off, so badly off, that

18:39.559 --> 18:41.340
you won’t know what you are doing.

18:41.340 --> 18:44.390
Just don’t think of any problems, anything
at all.

18:44.390 --> 18:48.460
When the problem’s coming you just give
it a bandhan, that’s all.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.760
And they’ll be neutralized.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.460
Let them come before you.

18:51.460 --> 18:56.750
Before they come, if you think they’ll become
solid because they are coming from a Yogi’s

18:56.750 --> 18:58.070
mind.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.399
Alright?

18:59.399 --> 19:04.450
If they do not come from your mind, nobody’s
mind is stronger than yours.

19:04.450 --> 19:06.450
You must understand this.

19:06.450 --> 19:08.980
So, don’t have any problem, no problem.

19:08.980 --> 19:12.450
Now you said it, all right, I’ll do it I
said.

19:12.450 --> 19:16.309
I never said, “This is the problem, this
is that, this could be, I may be” Nothing,

19:16.309 --> 19:21.440
I just changed over.

19:21.440 --> 19:31.780
And you must be prepared to change accordingly.

19:31.780 --> 19:36.930
Now, see, I’ll tell you.

19:36.930 --> 19:48.360
First time, we decided to have our program
in Switzerland.

19:48.360 --> 19:52.039
9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th.

19:52.039 --> 19:57.029
Now, what happened, they said in Switzerland
to have a program in November would be better,

19:57.029 --> 19:58.640
after September.

19:58.640 --> 20:02.210
Because according to Grégoire, he said, “I’ll
be there settled down, we’ll do it well”.

20:02.210 --> 20:03.510
So, I said, “All right”.

20:03.510 --> 20:04.950
So now we changed it over.

20:04.950 --> 20:07.220
So, I said, “When do we have Switzerland
then?”

20:07.220 --> 20:08.220
“Later on”.

20:08.220 --> 20:10.669
So, just now no problem.

20:10.669 --> 20:15.399
Then we saw – they told Me that they would
like Me to go to Tunisia.

20:15.399 --> 20:20.799
And in Tunisia, then they told Me – facing
the problem as it comes too – there is Ramadan.

20:20.799 --> 20:25.320
So, I said, “Change it over, make it Italy
during that time”.

20:25.320 --> 20:29.910
And this Italy thinks that we go to Tunisia.

20:29.910 --> 20:36.799
So, I told- what’s his name?

20:36.799 --> 20:38.260
– Antonio- now he is an Italian.

20:38.260 --> 20:41.950
I told him that, “See Italy is like this,
have they booked halls there?”

20:41.950 --> 20:43.410
He said, “Yes, they have.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.899
But no problem, no problem”.

20:45.899 --> 20:51.460
Italians will always say, “No problem”,
always, I’ve seen, “No problem, we can

20:51.460 --> 21:09.529
have

21:09.529 --> 21:11.370
it there”.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.200
Finished.

21:13.200 --> 21:44.309
Warren used to do that and then he got very
sick, you see.

21:44.309 --> 21:59.659
And
he said.

21:59.659 --> 22:15.581
No, he said, “This cannot be done because
there is a problem on this day, I’ll be

22:15.581 --> 22:16.940
there, this, that”.

22:16.940 --> 22:24.261
And that day he was
in the hospital.

22:24.261 --> 22:31.049
[Laughter]
And

22:31.049 --> 22:38.350
we managed the show without him.

22:38.350 --> 22:43.110
Then, then he never said it.

22:43.110 --> 22:47.650
This problem is a modern word.

22:47.650 --> 22:49.159
Modern word.

22:49.159 --> 22:51.429
It didn’t exist.

22:51.429 --> 22:56.870
If you read Maupassant you won’t find this
word, problem.

22:56.870 --> 22:59.529
This is all very modern problem.

22:59.529 --> 23:06.690
Because, you see, this has become- [showing
Her Agnya] all the time seeking for problems,

23:06.690 --> 23:09.399
mind has become like that.

23:09.399 --> 23:11.429
Immediately we think of a problem.

23:11.429 --> 23:13.950
I’ll tell you one point I’ve seen.

23:13.950 --> 23:14.950
I’ve studied it.

23:14.950 --> 23:18.980
With Warren, I studied it very well because
I tell him something immediately, he comes

23:18.980 --> 23:20.540
out: “This is the problem”.

23:20.540 --> 23:23.820
No, never he said: “All right”.

23:23.820 --> 23:28.230
Always, “But with this, this is the problem”.

23:28.230 --> 23:29.280
That’s spontaneous.

23:29.280 --> 23:34.100
I don’t blame anyone, it’s a spontaneous
thing with your minds, you are always.

23:34.100 --> 23:37.770
You may do the same, anybody may do the same.

23:37.770 --> 23:40.890
Marie: Definitely.

23:40.890 --> 23:50.250
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: Yes, it’s true.

23:50.250 --> 24:09.340
I am the only person who is giving solutions
while others are all the time giving Me problems.

24:09.340 --> 24:19.440
But not in India.

24:19.440 --> 24:36.840
Like, I’ll tell you a very good example.

24:36.840 --> 24:48.049
One day, you see, my husband takes one particular
type of tea called Prestige.

24:48.049 --> 25:05.460
[Laughter]
And that’s the only addiction he has, so

25:05.460 --> 25:06.799
I don’t mind, it’s not much.

25:06.799 --> 25:16.440
So, I told him that you will get some tea
for yourself and he forgot and it was a Saturday.

25:16.440 --> 25:25.269
And
then Sunday I told him, “Now we have no

25:25.269 --> 25:26.529
tea because, how about?

25:26.529 --> 25:27.950
You won’t take any other tea.

25:27.950 --> 25:39.190
So, what to do?”

25:39.190 --> 25:40.980
But we have to go to the reception.

25:40.980 --> 25:49.840
On our way back, we’ll go to the shop and
get the tea.

25:49.840 --> 26:00.260
So, he said, “What nonsense, it’s a Sunday,
how can you go to the shop and that too about

26:00.260 --> 26:05.539
eight o’clock in the night?

26:05.539 --> 26:12.460
How will you get the tea?

26:12.460 --> 26:14.750
What nonsense!”

26:14.750 --> 26:27.769
But this problem was correct, I mean, this
was so, that was the fact for all practical

26:27.769 --> 26:29.000
purposes.

26:29.000 --> 26:36.380
[Aside, Little open it, I think.

26:36.380 --> 26:37.610
Yes.]

26:37.610 --> 26:41.279
But not for Adi Shakti.

26:41.279 --> 26:54.120
So, we went to the reception and I told the
driver that we have to

26:54.120 --> 27:07.260
go to this “Tea center” on our way back.

27:07.260 --> 27:13.690
So, my husband said, “You are crazy!”

27:13.690 --> 27:14.690
[Laughter]

27:14.690 --> 27:24.900
But my driver has faith in Me, I think, he
took us there without giving any problem,

27:24.900 --> 27:27.130
without saying anything, he just took Me down.

27:27.130 --> 27:40.150
And to our amazement the shop was open and
lights were on.

27:40.150 --> 27:45.480
To my amazement!

27:45.480 --> 27:52.120
[Laughter]
Marie: You are very faithful to your husband.

27:52.120 --> 27:56.519
Shri Mataji: Yes, so,
And so, we went in.

27:56.519 --> 28:02.600
And they were all, were saying, “Oh, we
have been waiting for you.

28:02.600 --> 28:05.720
We were thinking you’ve forgotten about
our invitation.

28:05.720 --> 28:07.399
Why didn’t you come?

28:07.399 --> 28:08.509
What’s the problem?”

28:08.509 --> 28:09.509
C.P.

28:09.509 --> 28:12.299
started looking this side.

28:12.299 --> 28:16.950
[Laughter]
Actually, he was invited to an opening ceremony

28:16.950 --> 28:26.530
there, something.

28:26.530 --> 28:39.159
There was going to be a ceremony, something
for him.

28:39.159 --> 28:53.830
And that invitation card he had forgotten
in the office and he had forgotten about the

28:53.830 --> 28:56.530
invitation also.

28:56.530 --> 29:01.460
So, they gave us two tins each as presents
of Prestige Tea.

29:01.460 --> 29:17.870
[Laughter]
My husband said, “Really, I can’t believe

29:17.870 --> 29:21.020
it!”

29:21.020 --> 29:24.169
[Laughter]

29:24.169 --> 29:25.169
It is like that.

29:25.169 --> 29:26.169
All right?

29:26.169 --> 29:27.169
So, have faith.

29:27.169 --> 29:28.169
Have faith.

29:28.169 --> 29:37.570
All the Gods, all the angels, all the deities,
Ritambhara PrAgnya, all are working out Sahaja

29:37.570 --> 29:39.669
Yoga.

29:39.669 --> 29:48.809
We are not working it out.

29:48.809 --> 29:51.730
We are just instruments.

29:51.730 --> 29:54.010
But they watch you very clearly.

29:54.010 --> 29:59.750
So, just go ahead straightforward, everything
will work out.

29:59.750 --> 30:05.500
[Shri Mataji takes a flower]
“Tout droit” [straightforward], that’s

30:05.500 --> 30:06.500
it.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.690
Al right, “Tout droit”.

30:08.690 --> 30:15.049
Oh, I got four hundred pounds with that word
“tout droit”.

30:15.049 --> 30:17.470
I’ll tell you what.

30:17.470 --> 30:18.470
[Laughter]

30:18.470 --> 30:21.150
I had learned one word, “tout droit”,
you see.

30:21.150 --> 30:24.590
“Tout droit” I had learned the word here.

30:24.590 --> 30:36.309
My husband is supposed to have learned French,
for the last, I think, forty years he is learning

30:36.309 --> 30:40.410
French, so-called.

30:40.410 --> 30:48.590
“Tout droit, tout droit”.

30:48.590 --> 30:58.350
So, he says- we came here, both of us and
– [to Marie] you remember my husband and

30:58.350 --> 31:00.789
myself were left alone in that hotel?

31:00.789 --> 31:03.769
Because he came here for a day.

31:03.769 --> 31:15.220
So, we said, “We will stay together for
one day there in the hotel”.

31:15.220 --> 31:21.779
It was a Sunday.

31:21.779 --> 31:28.920
And that was a Sunday and the dinner was not
served in the hotel.

31:28.920 --> 31:32.440
So, we had to go out and we- he didn’t know
anything of Paris and I also didn’t know

31:32.440 --> 31:33.440
much.

31:33.440 --> 31:45.659
And the

31:45.659 --> 31:51.100
taxi fellow came in, because they had [called
a taxi ?] went in the taxi and the taxi fellow

31:51.100 --> 32:01.029
dropped us at some place, you see, very funny,
you see, Wimpy [fast-food] sort of a bad place

32:01.029 --> 32:02.289
for dinner.

32:02.289 --> 32:04.179
Sahaja Yogi: V.I.P.

32:04.179 --> 32:06.700
Shri Mataji: Yes, something.

32:06.700 --> 32:08.330
And then we got in another taxi.

32:08.330 --> 32:13.850
You see, this fellow understood that we don’t
understand French and we don’t know Paris.

32:13.850 --> 32:25.340
So, my husband was telling him, “Left, right”
and all that?

32:25.340 --> 32:30.590
So, I said: “You should say for ‘straight
through’, you have to say ‘tout droit’”.

32:30.590 --> 32:33.559
[while Marie translates] To right…

32:33.559 --> 32:38.899
No, no, for the right you say “à droite”.

32:38.899 --> 32:42.539
[Laughter]
So, I said: “No, ‘tout droit’ means

32:42.539 --> 32:43.879
straight drive through”.

32:43.879 --> 32:47.009
So, he said: “No, it’s not so”.

32:47.009 --> 32:49.820
I said: “I tell you it is so”.

32:49.820 --> 32:51.190
He said, “All right.

32:51.190 --> 32:54.789
Four hundred pounds, it’s not so”."

32:54.789 --> 33:06.049
[Laughter]
It’s like the fellow understood ‘tout

33:06.049 --> 33:09.940
droit’ is like ‘straight drive through’
to them.

33:09.940 --> 33:12.429
And then he found out that it was correct.

33:12.429 --> 33:13.429
He has not yet paid Me.

33:13.429 --> 33:14.429
[Laughter]

33:14.429 --> 33:21.289
Then another thing I said: “There is no
word for ‘awareness in French”.

33:21.289 --> 33:22.980
He said: “No, there is”.

33:22.980 --> 33:24.210
I said, “What?

33:24.210 --> 33:25.210
” He said: “Conscience”.

33:25.210 --> 33:27.399
I said: “‘Conscience’ is not, it’s
conscious.

33:27.399 --> 33:29.720
But there’s nothing for awareness in French”.

33:29.720 --> 33:31.370
So, he said, “There is.

33:31.370 --> 33:32.370
There must be”.

33:32.370 --> 33:33.679
I said, “There isn’t”.

33:33.679 --> 33:37.260
So, then he asked his – you see, he has
many French people with him.

33:37.260 --> 33:39.080
They said, “There is no word in French,
you see”.

33:39.080 --> 33:42.789
So, he lost again four hundred pounds which
he has not given Me.

33:42.789 --> 33:44.010
[Laughter]
All right!

33:44.010 --> 33:46.450
French Yogi: You are very ‘adroite’.

33:46.450 --> 33:50.929
[‘adroite’ means deft, skillful but ‘à
droite’ means ‘to the right.

33:50.929 --> 33:53.250
]
Shri Mataji: You see, he knew two words.

33:53.250 --> 33:56.190
He knew ‘droite’ and he knew also the
other one ‘gauche’, you see.

33:56.190 --> 33:58.909
But he didn’t know what I was telling him.

33:58.909 --> 34:04.179
So, you see, ‘right through’, in that
also there is ‘right’, ‘right through’,

34:04.179 --> 34:05.179
you see.

34:05.179 --> 34:08.330
So, he said, “No, I’m saying ‘right’”.

34:08.330 --> 34:16.180
Sahaja Yogi: But we have a third sense, you
have ‘adroite’.

34:16.180 --> 34:20.470
[In French: how to say it?]

34:20.470 --> 34:26.890
‘Clever’ means also – in one word it
means ‘adroite’.

34:26.890 --> 34:29.040
Marie: Deft, deftness.

34:29.040 --> 34:31.640
To be deft is ‘adroite’, ‘être adroite’.

34:31.640 --> 34:32.920
In one word.

34:32.920 --> 34:34.200
Shri Mataji: Adroite!

34:34.200 --> 34:39.360
Marie: And inversely to be ‘gauche’ in
French means ‘not to be deft’ with your

34:39.360 --> 34:40.360
hands.

34:40.360 --> 34:43.040
Shri Mataji: Like left-sided and right-sided.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.420
It means that.

34:44.420 --> 34:50.360
That means you knew about it.

34:50.360 --> 34:54.510
Right sided are over-efficient and the left-sided
are over-emotional.

34:54.510 --> 35:01.790
All right.

35:01.790 --> 35:16.350
May God bless you.

35:16.350 --> 35:18.430
May God bless you all.

35:18.430 --> 35:23.560
Judie are you comfortable here?

35:23.560 --> 35:24.800
Sahaja Yogini: Very much Mother.

35:24.800 --> 35:25.940
Shri Mataji: And Anya [?] is she comfortable?

35:25.940 --> 35:26.940
Other Sahaja Yogini: I’m here Mother.

35:26.940 --> 35:27.950
Shri Mataji: Yes, and the baby, yes?

35:27.950 --> 35:28.950
Other Sahaja Yogini: Very good, Mother.

35:28.950 --> 35:29.950
Shri Mataji: All right.

35:29.950 --> 35:30.950
Enjoy yourself.

35:30.950 --> 35:33.500
Tomorrow they are going to – today they
arranged something for you to go out?

35:33.500 --> 35:34.500
Judie: We did today.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.300
Shri Mataji: You did it.

35:36.300 --> 35:39.020
Tomorrow also, if you want, you can do it,
if you want to go somewhere.

35:39.020 --> 35:40.020
All right?

35:40.020 --> 35:41.950
May God bless you.

35:41.950 --> 35:43.690
How are you Aïcha?

35:43.690 --> 35:49.140
Are you all right?

35:49.140 --> 35:50.940
Good.

35:50.940 --> 35:54.520
Let’s go.

35:54.520 --> 35:59.380
How is Françoise, your mother-in-law?

35:59.380 --> 36:02.220
She’s all right?

36:02.220 --> 36:09.150
All right, she’s now married and very happy.

36:09.150 --> 36:13.080
A very good husband.

36:13.080 --> 36:18.180
A very nice house he has.

36:18.180 --> 36:45.710
He’s got

36:45.710 --> 36:59.940
a big job now.

36:59.940 --> 37:28.380
Bye, bye, for the time being.
