WEBVTT

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.473
As I said yesterday, today we are going to start

00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:16.451
from the very beginning, since when this Sahaja Yoga started.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.064
When I talk to you, I’ve to again request

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:38.142
that as a scientist you must keep your mind absolutely open

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.677
and do not hang on to any point which comes up in your mind.

00:00:46.702 --> 00:00:49.583
But try to understand

00:00:49.608 --> 00:00:56.177
that whatever I am telling you is today may be a hypothesis for you

00:00:56.202 --> 00:01:08.114
but tomorrow it will become a complete scientific thing,

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:16.676
for you have to understand the science of God’s love.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.739
Perhaps people cannot understand

00:01:20.764 --> 00:01:30.173
that all the sciences have come from God Almighty Himself.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.164
To understand God’s love and divinity

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.226
one has to open oneself

00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:51.000
to that absolute position from where all relativity disappears.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.970
You are living in the atmosphere of relativity.

00:01:58.783 --> 00:02:02.582
We have to find out our absolute.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.192
Unless and until we find out our absolute

00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:14.198
we are always in confusion and we think that

00:02:14.223 --> 00:02:17.253
this may be all right or that may be all right,

00:02:17.278 --> 00:02:20.778
if this is all right that could be all right.

00:02:20.803 --> 00:02:26.146
But we try to decide everything through our rationality.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.995
As the Lord has already told you, rationality is a limited means

00:02:33.513 --> 00:02:36.345
and I am talking of the unlimited.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.764
So if you have to go to unlimited

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:42.547
it has to be beyond the rationality.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.410
So with the open mind, I hope you will listen to Me,

00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:57.630
after realization when the power starts flowing through you,

00:02:57.655 --> 00:03:01.435
then you will be able to know how to maneuver it,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.315
how to understand it and how to keep it moving.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.977
Like one would explain about electricity first,

00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:13.816
then give you an experiment with the electricity flowing

00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:16.575
and explain to you how to use it.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.528
By using the electricity you will be convinced

00:03:21.553 --> 00:03:25.033
that it is a scientific tool.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.412
I could have started the lecture from creation

00:03:32.437 --> 00:03:35.625
but that would be too much to begin with.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.967
I would start it from your own being.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.817
When you are a human being

00:03:41.842 --> 00:03:45.500
you are not aware as to what are you inside.

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:48.615
As far as your physical body is concerned,

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.863
doctors only see the outside of your being.

00:03:51.888 --> 00:03:57.950
The inner subtle forces which are creating you,

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.826
which are looking after you

00:04:01.851 --> 00:04:08.098
and which are making you exist, you are absolutely unaware of.

00:04:08.575 --> 00:04:14.427
In our being there is first of all is the power

00:04:14.452 --> 00:04:18.110
which enters into our being from right hand side

00:04:18.135 --> 00:04:23.031
and goes to the left hand side which we call as Mahakali Shakti,

00:04:23.056 --> 00:04:26.196
is the power of Mahakali.

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:34.935
This Mahakali Shakti manifests within us

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:40.510
a power which runs through the Ida Nadi.

00:04:40.545 --> 00:04:46.286
Now this Nadi or this subtle channel is inside the brain

00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:48.899
and inside the spinal cord.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.866
This being the energy you cannot see it when it is dissected.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.017
For example if you dissect this you won't find electricity.

00:04:58.556 --> 00:05:03.920
This Ida Nadi on the left hand side gives us our existence

00:05:03.945 --> 00:05:10.543
and at the height in the gross manifests our left sympathetic nervous system.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.813
We exist because of this Ida Nadi.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.212
This is also manifesting all our emotional side of life

00:05:22.237 --> 00:05:24.383
which comes from our past.

00:05:24.408 --> 00:05:28.258
So it has all the past that is within us.

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:35.998
So Ida Nadi manifests, or we can say accumulates, all that is our past – ateet.

00:05:36.892 --> 00:05:39.059
This is our existence,

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.995
we take it for granted that we exist

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.619
we do whatever we please in our Ahamkara  in our own understanding.

00:05:46.644 --> 00:05:50.302
We try to do our level best to destroy ourselves

00:05:50.327 --> 00:05:57.918
and we reach a point where we have to give up.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:05.358
This is all decided for you how long you have to exist.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.720
It is all predestined.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.784
If you have to die at a point you will die.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.295
There is no one who is going to stop that.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.597
So some people who come and tell Me, “Mother,

00:06:15.622 --> 00:06:19.675
somebody is dying or dead. Can you make him live?”

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.175
If he has to live, he`ll definitely live.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.275
Only (faith) in the miracle of God makes you believe in Him;

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:34.760
but your time of birth and death are absolutely destined, which must be accepted.

00:06:35.575 --> 00:06:43.185
It is not the way it is described in your Kundalis, or in your horoscopes.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:49.725
In the horoscope, for example, a gentleman was to die about 5-6 years back

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.413
and he came to Me. He got his realization

00:06:52.438 --> 00:06:55.966
and he lived much longer after that; he’s still living.

00:06:55.993 --> 00:06:59.404
So he went to his pundit and he asked him,

00:06:59.429 --> 00:07:04.372
“How is it, you had predicted that I am going to die this year and still I am living?”

00:07:04.397 --> 00:07:08.673
Then he saw into the horoscope and he said, “By the way, did you meet

00:07:08.698 --> 00:07:10.375
any great spiritual personality?”

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.055
He said, “I did meet someone.”

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.395
He said, “That’s the reason.

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.224
I should have told you that, that if you had met,

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:20.156
if you meet this lady then this will be avoided.”

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:23.055
And it was to be avoided, and he met Me.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:25.775
So in a way there is a sanyoga always.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.420
Because you are here, you should not think

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.720
that you have deliberately come here

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.746
but it was to be that you should be here.

00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:38.643
Now if you do not take the advantage of this sanyoga,

00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:41.132
that freedom is with you.

00:07:41.157 --> 00:07:43.835
But sanyogas are created by God.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.934
He organizes and arranges that you meet the right person

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:49.255
that you get the right thing.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.724
But it is left to your freedom to choose the right or the wrong.

00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:58.140
Mostly we go according to our own whims and understanding.

00:07:58.682 --> 00:08:01.941
Even then if supposing our understanding

00:08:01.966 --> 00:08:05.360
was a pure understanding, and a simple understanding,

00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:08.715
we would know, we would be very sensitive to know

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.135
who is the real person, who is not.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.102
But normally when we live we play with our existence,

00:08:15.127 --> 00:08:19.727
we try to minimize our sensitivity.

00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:25.392
This left side can be described also as a destructive side

00:08:25.417 --> 00:08:30.938
because if it does not exist, it is destructive,

00:08:30.963 --> 00:08:32.571
it destroys you.

00:08:32.596 --> 00:08:36.808
That’s why it is called also a destroying power.

00:08:36.833 --> 00:08:40.095
That by this power you can be destroyed.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.801
If you are not to be existing any more,

00:08:45.826 --> 00:08:48.188
the same power can destroy you.

00:08:48.213 --> 00:08:57.275
Now, this left side power is very important and is very, very vital for our country,

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.510
specially, where we have traditions within us.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:07.121
Left sided people, those who are indulging into left side too much,

00:09:07.146 --> 00:09:10.615
are very emotional and they take to bhakti.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:15.920
If they take to bhakti they`ll go on calling God and working on that

00:09:15.945 --> 00:09:20.592
and doing all kinds of emotional expressions to get to God.

00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:25.464
This bhakti cult developed into our country, God knows how many years back,

00:09:25.489 --> 00:09:28.479
but has been working and there have been many people

00:09:28.504 --> 00:09:31.455
who have been getting into this bhakti cult.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.790
But when you cross a certain limit of this left side,

00:09:34.815 --> 00:09:38.216
you enter into collective sub-conscious area.

00:09:38.241 --> 00:09:41.735
If this is the sub-conscious then you go beyond that.

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:48.733
If you go into collective sub-conscious, then you might find yourself attacked by people

00:09:48.758 --> 00:09:51.295
whom you do not know, or maybe you know,

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.396
and that’s how we get people who get possessed.

00:09:54.421 --> 00:09:58.621
All your emotional problems, all your mental problem

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.400
which are called as a lunacy and all that,

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:11.777
are coming because of the defective behavior in this area.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.606
If you go into the left side area, as I told you,

00:10:16.631 --> 00:10:23.780
by any means like supposing some people are very fond of going through the cemeteries.

00:10:23.805 --> 00:10:26.930
I don’t know why, but they have… there are some funny people like that.

00:10:26.955 --> 00:10:29.375
We had a doctor in London,

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.675
he is a Russian doctor but now he is in Australia.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:37.799
He came to Me and he had a problem on this left hand side, Ida Nadi.

00:10:38.115 --> 00:10:41.705
And I was amazed. I said how can this doctor from Russia

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:46.020
and living in Australia and now in London can have such a problem like that.

00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:47.515
I asked him several questions,

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.990
“Do you live near a cemetery,

00:10:51.015 --> 00:10:52.995
or do you have somebody dead in your family?

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:55.680
Have you wept for someone, somebody has shocked you

00:10:55.705 --> 00:11:00.601
or what has happened that this left side is so weak in you?

00:11:00.626 --> 00:11:06.159
Or have you indulged into too much of drug-taking or something like that?”

00:11:06.184 --> 00:11:09.125
He said, “None. Shri Mother, I have not done anything like that

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.895
neither have I been this way.”

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.735
Then I said, “You try to remember.”

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:17.545
Then he remembered that his grandmother was very fond of going to the cemetery

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:21.107
and in his childhood she used to take him in the pram.

00:11:21.132 --> 00:11:24.000
Then she… when he was walking also she used to take him.

00:11:24.025 --> 00:11:28.495
Until he was quite old, she always used to take him to that cemetery.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.955
Just imagine.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:33.568
It’s such a funny thing that we do not know in our past

00:11:33.593 --> 00:11:38.101
how we have indulged into this left hand side activity.

00:11:38.484 --> 00:11:41.866
Now, in our country whatever traditions we have had

00:11:41.891 --> 00:11:46.891
all of them mostly come from the great saints, who have meditated.

00:11:46.916 --> 00:11:51.963
Not most of them, but I would say quite a lot of them.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:58.071
But we cannot say (that) there is not a single tradition which is wrong in India.

00:11:58.096 --> 00:12:00.947
But the traditions can get perverted later on;

00:12:00.972 --> 00:12:04.597
but basically if you see, our traditions are very sensible.

00:12:04.622 --> 00:12:06.612
Like, when a person dies

00:12:06.619 --> 00:12:11.745
whatever rituals we have is a very, very sensible ritual.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:16.066
We Indians are not aware of it, the rituals that we do.

00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:20.495
Of course in that when the Brahmins start taking money, that’s the perversion.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.488
Nobody should take money if somebody is dying.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.356
It`s very sinful to do that

00:12:28.381 --> 00:12:31.576
because he`ll be affected by the left hand side attacks.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:37.698
Those people who do all this kind of work and earned money out of the deaths of others

00:12:37.723 --> 00:12:39.667
are very dangerously placed.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:45.100
Moreover. when you also find that somebody is dead in your family…

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.155
so many people when they come to Me,

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.115
I find left hand side is a problem in India.

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.115
The reason is this – if somebody is dead,

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.036
say the father has died early or a mother has died early,

00:12:56.406 --> 00:12:59.570
then people start worrying about that person.

00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:03.444
If father has died at a very early age,

00:13:03.469 --> 00:13:06.956
supposing in the case of a girl, she feels very insecure.

00:13:06.981 --> 00:13:09.607
All the time she is thinking about him.

00:13:09.632 --> 00:13:13.780
Then that kind of a mind can create a problem on the left hand side

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.035
and we have to clear it out.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.781
It is that’s why very important what we do in [UNCLEAR]

00:13:19.806 --> 00:13:24.215
we start playing the band and all that, so that our idea is get out of it.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.149
Those people have died, have gone to another world.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.875
They have to go.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.855
They are not to hang around here

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.675
and we are not to keep them back and keep them under our bondage of our emotions.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.071
This we should understand.

00:13:38.096 --> 00:13:44.095
You see, in modern times, we just give up everything that was old. It`s a very wrong thing.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:48.793
Because, whatever they have discovered is of eternal.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:54.071
I`ve seen people, even if you tell them that you forget, forget about it,

00:13:54.096 --> 00:13:55.745
now don’t worry about it,

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:56.775
they won’t listen.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:01.814
And then you find them getting into serious diseases like epilepsy,

00:14:01.839 --> 00:14:06.155
into lunacy and other mental troubles.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.380
Specially among women we find hysteria develops

00:14:09.405 --> 00:14:13.120
if this kind of a problem is there.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:23.175
Now it is not easy to believe into a thing that there is something like dead bodies hanging around.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:28.195
It’s very, very difficult for any educated man to believe into such a nonsense,

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.749
but they do.

00:14:30.219 --> 00:14:32.849
You have to know that they do exist.

00:14:32.874 --> 00:14:35.620
Now that doesn’t means that you believe in their powers

00:14:35.794 --> 00:14:42.115
but that you must know that they exist and that’s why you have to keep in your maryadas.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:47.396
You have to keep in the center and don’t go too much on one side.

00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:48.860
In bhakti also

00:14:48.885 --> 00:14:50.888
when people overdo it

00:14:50.913 --> 00:14:55.555
like if they start weeping and crying

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:59.070
and saying that “Oh Lord, You must come and

00:14:59.095 --> 00:15:02.655
give us some darshan” or something like that

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.724
morning till evening they fast and

00:15:05.749 --> 00:15:10.175
they say that “Unless and until You appear before us, we are going to die.”

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:20.802
All these things when you try, is emotional style of working it out. You cannot achieve it

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.210
because this is your Manasa, this is your mind.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:26.950
Through your mind you cannot achieve God.

00:15:26.975 --> 00:15:30.015
By crying and weeping, you`ll go into tantrums.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:34.336
You`ll do all kinds of nonsensical things that people may think you are madcap.

00:15:34.361 --> 00:15:37.675
They might think you are just acting or they… I don’t know what they will think,

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.662
but you do not achieve anything by this kind of crying.

00:15:40.687 --> 00:15:45.019
For example now we have in India

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:49.120
I mean it started here I think, this Hare Rama Hare Krishna cult.

00:15:49.145 --> 00:15:55.122
These people are so funny that in Oxford Street if you go in London

00:15:55.147 --> 00:15:59.148
you`ll find them wearing those dhotis and   sarees.

00:15:59.173 --> 00:16:01.855
They don’t know how to wear and how to carry on with that

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.779
and taking a dhoti in the hand and with great gusto they are going on

00:16:05.804 --> 00:16:07.735
“Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Hare Rama Hare Krishna”

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.437
And the saree  falls off and the dhoti falls off

00:16:10.462 --> 00:16:13.488
and they also wears those bodhis you see which are attached to the

00:16:13.513 --> 00:16:18.082
thing with a little clamp, I think or gum or something.

00:16:18.107 --> 00:16:20.611
Because they don’t have so they have to buy it in the market.

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.995
They have made a market out of it.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.040
They are selling all these things in the market.

00:16:25.065 --> 00:16:27.035
They are selling the dhotis, they are selling this,

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:28.295
they don’t know how to wear dhotis

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.175
and there`s somebody who will make you wear.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.200
They shave off their hair, they do all these things.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:36.821
Mother (speaks in Hindi): Baith jaiye, uthiye nahin bicch mein. Logon ka attention bahut sensitive hota hai.

00:16:36.845 --> 00:16:38.754
Koi khara ho gaya toh aap zaroor use dekhenge.

00:16:38.778 --> 00:16:40.269
Seeker (speaks in Hindi): Dekhiye, itna critical hona thik nahi hai.

00:16:40.293 --> 00:16:43.077
Aacha aap, aapko, aap bahar jaaiye

00:16:43.101 --> 00:16:45.925
kyonki aap ke samajh mein aane nahi wala kyon critical hain. Aap bahar jaaiye.

00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:46.600
Seeker (continues in Hindi): Nahin, nahin

00:16:46.624 --> 00:16:49.020
Hame jo kehna hai, kehne dijiye. Dekhiye,

00:16:49.044 --> 00:16:52.036
Hame jo kehna hai kehne dijiye. Aap se kya matlab hai.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.420
Jahan critical hai, wahan critical hona hai.

00:16:54.444 --> 00:16:58.204
Woh toh aapko patha nahi ki Christ ne toh hunter leke mara tha in logon ko.

00:16:58.228 --> 00:17:00.281
Ham toh kam se kam shabon se hi bol rahe hain.

00:17:00.305 --> 00:17:03.240
Jo baat jhoot hai woh jhoot hai aur jo saach

00:17:03.264 --> 00:17:06.726
hai who saach hai aur woh kahne mein hamaari himmat hai uski aap dath dein.

00:17:08.267 --> 00:17:11.266
Aapko, aapko abhi uska andaaza hua nahi hai na.

00:17:11.291 --> 00:17:14.475
Aage ki sun lijiye ek minute. Accha, usse…

00:17:14.499 --> 00:17:17.629
What has happened with that? Why I`m criticizing?

00:17:17.653 --> 00:17:23.605
Or with all this when they come to me, they have the cancer of the throat, now will you cure that.

00:17:23.629 --> 00:17:24.967
Will you clear that?

00:17:24.992 --> 00:17:26.794
It is very easy for you to shout here,

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:29.035
this is not a political meeting that you come and talk.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.515
No. But you should understand what I am talking.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.477
They are suffering from cancer of the throat.

00:17:36.451 --> 00:17:39.455
Dekhiye, aapko accha nahi lagta hai toh aap bahar chale jayiye.

00:17:39.465 --> 00:17:41.495
Jo mujhe kahna hai woh main kahoongi aapko sunna hai, sunein

00:17:41.515 --> 00:17:44.915
Seeker: It is better she is critical. By critical mind… being critical-minded, you can understand better.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.052
After all, I am not going to say that you go and do the same thing.

00:17:48.077 --> 00:17:53.613
You know, these boys when they come to me they are suffering from cancer of the throat.

00:17:53.638 --> 00:17:55.707
Now, is this gentleman going to cure?

00:17:55.732 --> 00:17:58.528
I have cured them and I have to go through it.

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:00.900
What has he done so far that he is talking?

00:18:00.925 --> 00:18:02.176
He should keep quiet

00:18:02.201 --> 00:18:05.109
because he doesn’t know anything, he has no authority just now.

00:18:05.767 --> 00:18:09.535
And please understand that this is not the way to listen to Me.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.187
I`ll say what I have to say,

00:18:11.212 --> 00:18:13.424
I am not afraid of anyone.

00:18:13.449 --> 00:18:18.236
And if anything is wrong, I am going to say it even if you crucify Me.

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:25.980
Now this, this is what I was going to that if you do such a thing,

00:18:26.831 --> 00:18:30.153
extraordinary thing, you develop cancer.

00:18:30.566 --> 00:18:32.227
Yesterday only I had said.

00:18:32.252 --> 00:18:35.015
How do you get into sympathetic  attitude?

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:40.419
I am just telling you this is how you get into left hand sympathetic attitude.

00:18:40.444 --> 00:18:43.980
And do you know cancer is caused

00:18:44.005 --> 00:18:48.601
by left hand problem not by the right hand which is physical?

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.477
Just have some patience about it.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.745
This kind of nonsense if you start doing in the house,

00:18:57.392 --> 00:18:59.315
and if you get tomorrow the cancer…

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:02.110
Now I`ll tell you exactly the name of the person

00:19:02.135 --> 00:19:04.332
and everything, I`m not afraid of anything

00:19:04.365 --> 00:19:06.458
because I have cured.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:10.055
I`ve got the proof of it and I can show you that.

00:19:10.254 --> 00:19:14.407
That was Dr. Mulay, you can contact him. I don’t know if he has come today.

00:19:14.432 --> 00:19:16.728
He sent one boy to me,

00:19:16.737 --> 00:19:19.932
only twelve year old boy suffering from leukemia,

00:19:19.957 --> 00:19:22.529
twelve year old boy.

00:19:23.988 --> 00:19:27.316
And he came to me, he was suffering from leukemia

00:19:27.341 --> 00:19:30.373
and when I went into his history and all that

00:19:30.398 --> 00:19:32.999
I couldn’t find any trace of his father

00:19:33.024 --> 00:19:36.074
going into any guru or any wrong type of a person.

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:41.792
But when I asked him about his grandfather

00:19:41.817 --> 00:19:45.402
with whom this little boy was living, he had a guru

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:49.177
and I also know the name of the guru,

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.051
and this boy was suffering from leukemia.

00:19:53.166 --> 00:19:57.795
Now Mohammad Sahab has told us the methods how to get rid of these horrible gurus.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:01.089
You have to write the name of the guru and beat him with shoes.

00:20:01.114 --> 00:20:03.354
That’s the only way you can cure.

00:20:03.379 --> 00:20:06.584
Now, at that time nobody would say that you don’t criticize,

00:20:06.609 --> 00:20:08.685
because the child is twelve-year old,

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:12.712
suffering from leukemia, will die within one month’s time.

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:18.243
In all compassion, think of it.

00:20:18.274 --> 00:20:21.120
How dangerous it is. And I should not warn?

00:20:21.145 --> 00:20:22.855
I am your Mother.

00:20:22.875 --> 00:20:27.455
I am not here for any political leadership or any sort of an election.

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:31.779
In all compassion I am telling you that don’t indulge into such things.

00:20:31.804 --> 00:20:37.629
Now this fellow, when he got leukemia

00:20:37.654 --> 00:20:39.502
and his father told Me,

00:20:39.527 --> 00:20:42.715
I told him that you beat him with shoes.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.275
He called his father, his father also had to beat that guru.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.953
You can ask Dr. Mulay

00:20:47.978 --> 00:20:52.077
there was no trace of leukemia, within three days he cured.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.731
But we had to work hard.

00:20:54.756 --> 00:20:56.604
I am not here to cure people.

00:20:56.629 --> 00:20:58.652
Why not I take precautionary measures?

00:20:58.677 --> 00:21:00.765
Supposing there is something wrong with the penicillin,

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.411
wont you say that there is something wrong with the penicillin?

00:21:03.436 --> 00:21:05.153
Is it criticism?

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.455
Why should I criticize? What do I gain by that?

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.975
I`m not earning any money out of you people.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.410
I`m not living on your any support.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.577
Why should I not criticize something that is to be criticized?

00:21:18.602 --> 00:21:21.469
Whatever is to be said, has to be said by somebody.

00:21:22.291 --> 00:21:24.690
Somebody must have that much guts,

00:21:24.715 --> 00:21:29.432
to say whatever is right is right and whatever is wrong.

00:21:32.172 --> 00:21:36.267
So we come to this left side problem

00:21:36.292 --> 00:21:38.274
which I must tell you and warn you

00:21:38.299 --> 00:21:41.041
that if you go too much on the left hand side

00:21:43.532 --> 00:21:48.755
a kind of very funny situation develops

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.579
to such an extent, you`ll be surprised. We have another boy .

00:21:52.604 --> 00:21:56.255
his name is Ronny, in London.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:59.100
He is a very well educated boy, everything,

00:21:59.139 --> 00:22:01.995
and all the time what he does? He is crying.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.395
He`s doing no work, sleeping in the bed.

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:07.177
His name is Ronny… I said this in Hindi is Roni

00:22:08.155 --> 00:22:09.495
We call it roni-surat,

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:12.535
that’s was he was, and his mother is fed up of him.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.088
Thrice I sent him to his mother then she said,

00:22:14.113 --> 00:22:16.443
that’s was he was, and his mother is fed up of him

00:22:16.457 --> 00:22:18.435
he is just doing nothing, crying.”

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.260
I said, “What did you do?”

00:22:20.844 --> 00:22:24.115
You won’t believe if I tell you what he did, that how these things happen.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:27.522
He read Lord Byron, by heart.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.629
By reading such things, it works on your mind

00:22:31.654 --> 00:22:35.341
all these ideas of separation, ideas…

00:22:35.366 --> 00:22:38.155
I mean, he is not in separation at all,

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.155
nothing wrong with him, but you start identifying.

00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.615
Human beings have a habit to identify.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.217
When you start identifying with such things,

00:22:47.242 --> 00:22:51.096
you do get into troubles, and when you get into troubles

00:22:51.121 --> 00:22:54.586
you get direct to the lunatic asylum

00:22:54.611 --> 00:22:57.147
without even knowing that you are getting mad.

00:22:57.893 --> 00:23:00.021
Madness, lunacy…

00:23:00.035 --> 00:23:02.658
Yesterday only there was a boy here who said,

00:23:02.683 --> 00:23:05.095
“Mother, I have become mad now.

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.255
They are going to put me to the lunatic asylum.”

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.256
Among you he was sitting

00:23:09.892 --> 00:23:11.860
Among you he was sitting

00:23:12.588 --> 00:23:16.170
Now if I discover what sort of a thing he had,

00:23:16.195 --> 00:23:19.513
should I not tell you that this is the reason why people become mad

00:23:19.538 --> 00:23:21.715
and you just don’t do it?

00:23:23.612 --> 00:23:28.512
We must understand that we always overdo things. Ati.

00:23:28.986 --> 00:23:30.515
Ati sadaa varjet.

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.575
That’s why it is written that it should be given up.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.774
We should keep to our maryadas:

00:23:35.799 --> 00:23:38.575
don’t go too much emotional also,

00:23:38.933 --> 00:23:41.575
nor too much intellectual,

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.681
nor too much physical,

00:23:43.706 --> 00:23:47.627
but keep a middle path of everything.

00:23:48.225 --> 00:23:51.853
I am telling you this because this is one extreme I am describing,

00:23:51.878 --> 00:23:53.783
to which we go.

00:23:53.808 --> 00:23:59.091
We Indians are specially gifted by emotional beauty,

00:23:59.116 --> 00:24:00.438
that’s no doubt,

00:24:00.463 --> 00:24:03.295
but sometimes the way we are attached

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.376
to things can take us to very wrong things.

00:24:06.401 --> 00:24:09.215
Like, we may be attached to our family.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.599
It`s a very good thing,

00:24:10.624 --> 00:24:13.355
you must do for your family, you must do for your children.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:17.075
In Sahaja Yoga there is no place for any sanyasi.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.875
There is no place at all for any sanyasi

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:26.601
but that does not mean that you sell your country in the name of love.

00:24:26.626 --> 00:24:29.595
There are people, you know, who can sell their country.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:37.309
Now this is a country where persons like Shri Rama have been able to send

00:24:37.334 --> 00:24:40.928
the wife, the One who was the power behind Him,

00:24:40.953 --> 00:24:47.269
in the jungle just to have a proper public opinion.

00:24:47.294 --> 00:24:50.693
While we have people in this country you know that for definite.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.867
So many of them are there that just to look after their children,

00:24:53.892 --> 00:24:58.435
they do not mind doing anything wrong to their own countrymen.

00:24:58.767 --> 00:25:01.631
Is a very common disease with us

00:25:01.656 --> 00:25:04.822
and we must know that we should not overdo it.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.822
If we do it, if we overdo it,

00:25:08.847 --> 00:25:15.241
the relapse comes to it in the form of so many diseases; physically

00:25:15.266 --> 00:25:17.355
and mentally we get diseased.

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:21.815
Such people can become mentally absolutely obsessed.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:25.253
They might become blind;

00:25:25.278 --> 00:25:31.959
they might become very, what you call, dislocated people.

00:25:31.984 --> 00:25:33.809
Their old age would be very difficult.

00:25:33.834 --> 00:25:35.736
They might develop gangrene

00:25:35.761 --> 00:25:41.235
and they may develop even terrible heart troubles, heart attacks,

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:42.766
all these things that follow

00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:47.015
because if you are overdoing such a thing it can work out.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.877
But surprisingly, it is a very great surprise,

00:25:50.902 --> 00:25:55.163
that when you indulge too much into your emotions,

00:25:55.824 --> 00:25:58.355
we feel the person is getting a heart attack

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:02.374
because such a person will cry and weep and say all those things.

00:26:02.399 --> 00:26:06.584
But actually, if you show to the doctor he`ll say there is no heart attack.

00:26:08.325 --> 00:26:12.477
Actually what happens that when you indulge too much into the left hand side,

00:26:12.502 --> 00:26:13.920
your brain goes out.

00:26:13.945 --> 00:26:17.180
See how the nature has balanced it.

00:26:18.488 --> 00:26:21.510
In any lunatic asylum, you go and find out,

00:26:21.535 --> 00:26:23.860
there won’t be one heart attack case.

00:26:23.885 --> 00:26:25.680
They will look like that

00:26:25.705 --> 00:26:28.237
but actually if you see,

00:26:28.262 --> 00:26:32.635
you will not find even one person dying of heart attack,

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:36.695
because the brain is affected.

00:26:36.926 --> 00:26:38.629
We are working with our heart

00:26:38.653 --> 00:26:42.285
and the brain goes out – see the balance the nature has got.

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.741
So going to the extremes are controlled by the brain.

00:26:47.017 --> 00:26:51.552
On the left hand side, one has to be careful as to how far you go.

00:26:51.684 --> 00:26:53.426
Seeker: What is meant by going left side?

00:26:53.451 --> 00:26:58.599
Now, that is what I am trying to say is to be very emotional,  very emotional.

00:26:58.624 --> 00:27:02.561
You see, here I`ll say ghazal baaz log, there are many here,

00:27:02.586 --> 00:27:04.859
I know that they`re very fond of ghazals.

00:27:04.884 --> 00:27:06.410
Now, these ghazals are…

00:27:06.435 --> 00:27:08.910
some of them are sung in the name of God,

00:27:08.935 --> 00:27:12.204
in Milan [Ed- Union], in meeting with God.

00:27:12.229 --> 00:27:15.701
In meeting whatever is sung, is beautiful.

00:27:15.726 --> 00:27:20.557
But all the time singing of separation is the beginning of the end.

00:27:20.582 --> 00:27:23.526
Then you start feeling you are so miserable.

00:27:23.551 --> 00:27:26.547
You will have thousands of things around,

00:27:26.572 --> 00:27:28.086
but still you will be miserable.

00:27:28.111 --> 00:27:30.726
You think, “Oh what a miserable life I have,

00:27:30.751 --> 00:27:34.086
I am good for nothing. I have done this thing wrong.”

00:27:34.111 --> 00:27:37.986
You will be torturing your wife and sulking about it.

00:27:38.011 --> 00:27:39.536
You won’t talk to her.

00:27:39.561 --> 00:27:41.795
She will say that “Why are you not talking to me,”

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.706
and you will say, “I am so moody.”
This is the beginning.

00:27:43.731 --> 00:27:45.326
It starts like that.

00:27:45.351 --> 00:27:47.092
Then you start reading things

00:27:47.117 --> 00:27:50.532
how people have been tortured, what has happened to them,

00:27:50.557 --> 00:27:54.137
then with that you start also going… you see,

00:27:54.162 --> 00:27:56.981
the attention starts moving on the left hand side.

00:27:57.151 --> 00:27:59.686
Then you`ll start attention on the dead.

00:27:59.711 --> 00:28:01.888
I met the other day a very young girl,

00:28:01.913 --> 00:28:05.806
very young you won’t believe, hardly twenty-one, just engaged,

00:28:05.831 --> 00:28:09.162
very good girl, she had… left side was all finished.

00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:11.609
I said, “What books are you reading?”

00:28:11.886 --> 00:28:14.546
because I could not think of anything else in her case.

00:28:14.571 --> 00:28:16.812
And she gave me this Third Eye Fellow,

00:28:16.837 --> 00:28:18.738
and then… what is that another one?

00:28:18.763 --> 00:28:20.286
I don’t know, so many names she gave.

00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:23.882
They are discussing all about the dead and the devil.

00:28:24.165 --> 00:28:26.986
Why do you want, I asked her, to read about a devil?

00:28:27.011 --> 00:28:28.461
Are you going to become a devil?

00:28:28.848 --> 00:28:31.891
I mean the thing is, the knowledge which you are not going to use,

00:28:31.916 --> 00:28:33.802
why do you want to get into?

00:28:34.243 --> 00:28:37.363
why do you want to get into?

00:28:37.388 --> 00:28:40.903
Then, further, you can go to some guru

00:28:40.928 --> 00:28:44.943
who is an expert on preta-vidya, smashana-vidya, bhoota-vidya.

00:28:45.591 --> 00:28:48.593
This subject is so stunning, you can`t imagine

00:28:48.618 --> 00:28:50.018
how they mesmerized.

00:28:51.784 --> 00:28:55.988
They mesmerize you and create confidence in you.

00:28:56.013 --> 00:28:57.670
You`ll be amazed that in Sahaja Yoga

00:28:57.695 --> 00:29:00.541
now though we have been working for so many years,

00:29:00.566 --> 00:29:02.994
of course I am little shy of publicity

00:29:03.019 --> 00:29:05.856
because I sometimes I think if you publicize too much

00:29:05.881 --> 00:29:07.646
we`ll get all kinds of wrong people,

00:29:07.671 --> 00:29:10.440
but still whatever publicity we have been making,

00:29:10.465 --> 00:29:13.079
we have not been able to attract so many people

00:29:13.104 --> 00:29:14.826
as these fake gurus have.

00:29:14.851 --> 00:29:16.759
Though they take lots of money,

00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:19.669
people pay them money, do all kinds of things.

00:29:19.694 --> 00:29:23.686
Despite that people have been going to them.

00:29:23.711 --> 00:29:26.090
The reason is they have mesmerizing power.

00:29:26.291 --> 00:29:28.221
They just mesmerize you.

00:29:28.246 --> 00:29:30.199
Now how the mesmerism starts?

00:29:30.224 --> 00:29:34.467
See, even from – when we are religious people, mesmerism can start.

00:29:34.492 --> 00:29:36.185
Like, you go to the temple.

00:29:36.951 --> 00:29:41.218
The gentleman who`s sitting there will sell you some sort of a thread.

00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:45.176
You will be amazed – that thread itself may mesmerize.

00:29:45.571 --> 00:29:48.681
Then you`ll go to the same temple, every time you must go.

00:29:48.706 --> 00:29:51.209
If you do not go, you feel very funny, all that.

00:29:51.234 --> 00:29:53.466
You will give money, money, money to this man

00:29:53.491 --> 00:29:56.326
till you discover that something is gone wrong with you.

00:29:56.351 --> 00:29:57.972
Your memory has gone off.

00:29:57.997 --> 00:30:01.346
You can’t think; something is going wrong in your brain.

00:30:01.371 --> 00:30:04.491
The brain starts degenerating, when you get into these things.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:15.077
Too much of outburst of your emotions should be controlled

00:30:15.102 --> 00:30:17.116
and you should keep in the center.

00:30:17.141 --> 00:30:19.982
But that does not mean that you should be unemotional.

00:30:20.141 --> 00:30:23.417
We are at one extreme in India; that`s why I am stressing it too much

00:30:23.442 --> 00:30:26.487
that we are too much attached to things,

00:30:26.512 --> 00:30:30.633
should not be, to our family, we should

00:30:30.658 --> 00:30:33.013
We should not be attached to that extent

00:30:33.038 --> 00:30:35.883
that we do not even care for our self realization.

00:30:35.908 --> 00:30:38.537
I`ve seen people who come with their children here

00:30:38.562 --> 00:30:41.042
and they’ll say, “Mother first cure our child.”

00:30:41.481 --> 00:30:42.605
But what’s the use?

00:30:42.747 --> 00:30:44.149
You see, I cure the child,

00:30:44.174 --> 00:30:47.210
but what about you getting the realization which is the important thing?

00:30:47.235 --> 00:30:48.763
For them there may be more…

00:30:48.788 --> 00:30:51.785
most I can do for them is to cure their children,

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:55.060
that they don’t care even for their self realization.

00:30:55.201 --> 00:30:58.679
Now this left side problem, as I must tell you,

00:30:58.883 --> 00:31:00.316
is accentuated by…
[FV: tape 2-4 ends here]

00:31:00.341 --> 00:31:01.874
[FV: tape 3-4 starts here]
in a very subtle way

00:31:01.874 --> 00:31:03.888
like as if they are Gods.

00:31:04.079 --> 00:31:06.298
For example, I don’t know in Delhi

00:31:06.323 --> 00:31:08.990
but in Bombay there are many women who get

00:31:09.015 --> 00:31:12.068
Devi into them like they are maid servants

00:31:12.093 --> 00:31:15.477
or somebody who washes the clothes or something like that,

00:31:15.502 --> 00:31:16.816
she gets the Devi in her.

00:31:16.841 --> 00:31:19.313
Then she goes on, “Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo… like that,

00:31:19.317 --> 00:31:21.196
and people fall at her feet.

00:31:21.221 --> 00:31:24.157
Now, this is nothing but a possession.

00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:25.429
It’s a possession.

00:31:25.454 --> 00:31:27.326
It’s a regular possession.

00:31:27.351 --> 00:31:31.244
Devi… how can you bear the Devi like that

00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:34.438
when you do not know even how to bear your life?

00:31:34.463 --> 00:31:36.930
Devi doesn’t enter into such wretched women

00:31:36.955 --> 00:31:40.186
who are good for nothing; they have no holiness in them.

00:31:40.215 --> 00:31:41.929
How can Devi enter into them?

00:31:41.954 --> 00:31:44.439
But people think there is the Devi has come in them,

00:31:44.464 --> 00:31:46.741
it’s very great, and they fall at her feet.

00:31:47.558 --> 00:31:51.389
The I.G., D.I.G. in Bombay has told me

00:31:51.414 --> 00:31:54.304
that in the villages this left side working

00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:56.383
is getting stronger and stronger

00:31:56.408 --> 00:31:59.127
and there are many people who are still like that.

00:31:59.143 --> 00:32:02.840
There was regular cases going on; there were lots of them

00:32:02.865 --> 00:32:05.485
but one of them was brought to my notice

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:08.574
and then, with Sahaja Yoga, we could find out the culprit.

00:32:10.491 --> 00:32:12.655
These forces work out on people

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.507
who have weak minds in the sense that who are very,

00:32:15.532 --> 00:32:18.697
sort of very emotional, on the left hand side.

00:32:18.722 --> 00:32:21.936
Also right hand side there are problems but left hand side I am saying.

00:32:21.961 --> 00:32:27.199
So one should not be hard

00:32:27.224 --> 00:32:32.408
like a hard boiled egg, but one should not be in such a way

00:32:32.433 --> 00:32:37.854
that you can be influenced by these negative forces on the left hand side.

00:32:37.879 --> 00:32:40.543
Now we can see in the West,

00:32:40.568 --> 00:32:45.227
in the beginning they were very hard headed people, had no attachment.

00:32:45.252 --> 00:32:49.034
Even today, you won’t believe that in England

00:32:49.059 --> 00:32:53.175
everyday two children are killed by their parents.

00:32:53.505 --> 00:32:54.741
Can you believe it?

00:32:55.561 --> 00:32:58.037
Regular children, there`s nothing wrong with them,

00:32:58.061 --> 00:33:03.392
are killed by parents, everyday two children, in England.

00:33:04.638 --> 00:33:07.473
This is the statistics of England.

00:33:07.498 --> 00:33:10.496
So you can imagine what must be of America?

00:33:10.734 --> 00:33:12.578
So they, they think they are detached;

00:33:12.603 --> 00:33:15.906
they don’t mind even killing their parents or killing their children.

00:33:15.941 --> 00:33:18.774
This is going to the other extreme of the thing is,

00:33:18.799 --> 00:33:22.082
and that is the right hand side which I`ll tell you later on.

00:33:23.221 --> 00:33:28.380
So, first of all understand that emotions are

00:33:28.405 --> 00:33:30.620
to be guided by your wisdom.

00:33:30.645 --> 00:33:33.565
Any emotion that has no wisdom is useless.

00:33:34.041 --> 00:33:37.640
Actually emotions are nothing but expression of your love

00:33:37.665 --> 00:33:42.006
and if the love is not collective it has no meaning.

00:33:42.031 --> 00:33:46.976
For example, love is like a sap which rises in the tree.

00:33:47.721 --> 00:33:51.821
It goes to the flower, it goes to the leaves, it goes everywhere

00:33:52.309 --> 00:33:54.888
and when it reaches a point

00:33:54.912 --> 00:33:58.665
where it is just stagnated, say example, in one flower,

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:01.991
In the same way, when we get ourselves

00:34:02.025 --> 00:34:04.924
In the same way when we get ourselves

00:34:05.452 --> 00:34:08.505
completely involved into our family,

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:11.591
into our only children and think of nobody else,

00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:13.556
we do the same thing to our love.

00:34:13.581 --> 00:34:14.713
We get stagnated;

00:34:14.738 --> 00:34:18.657
our children may exploit it and may become very bad children.

00:34:18.761 --> 00:34:20.739
They may take it for granted.

00:34:20.764 --> 00:34:24.645
They may become so horrid to that they would… might be criminals.

00:34:24.652 --> 00:34:28.800
They can be very spoiled children, good for nothing

00:34:28.825 --> 00:34:31.244
and they may not be able to do anything in life.

00:34:31.269 --> 00:34:34.990
We have seen many children of very fond parents

00:34:35.015 --> 00:34:38.102
are spoiled like that and they are sometimes,

00:34:38.127 --> 00:34:41.738
all their lives are dependent and are parasites.

00:34:42.813 --> 00:34:45.970
Left handed people are mostly parasitic by nature.

00:34:46.063 --> 00:34:47.245
They are very parasitic,

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:54.247
we start the parasitic by, say, we, we ask somebody to look after.

00:34:54.421 --> 00:34:58.650
Especially in India I think is a very common thing, we depend on servants.

00:34:58.675 --> 00:35:02.003
We have to depend only on our parents for love for affection

00:35:02.028 --> 00:35:03.909
and also for support and money,

00:35:03.934 --> 00:35:06.421
and the parents go out of their way to help the children

00:35:06.446 --> 00:35:07.856
because their parents have done.

00:35:07.881 --> 00:35:09.156
That we have to do.

00:35:09.181 --> 00:35:11.982
But that doesn’t mean we should exploit them.

00:35:12.098 --> 00:35:16.718
Exploitation of such things can cause left hand problem .

00:35:16.743 --> 00:35:20.676
because gradually what will happen that your own

00:35:20.701 --> 00:35:23.567
right hand side will be absolutely underdeveloped,

00:35:23.592 --> 00:35:26.221
which is the will power, will be absolutely underdeveloped

00:35:26.245 --> 00:35:27.988
and you will be good for nothing.

00:35:28.007 --> 00:35:29.326
So we have to understand

00:35:29.351 --> 00:35:33.238
that left handed side has one beginning,

00:35:33.263 --> 00:35:35.227
ends up into many things

00:35:35.252 --> 00:35:39.797
and the worst of all is what you call

00:35:40.624 --> 00:35:44.131
the epilepsy part, or you can say the lunacy part

00:35:44.156 --> 00:35:46.938
or when we say a person has gone gaga.

00:35:48.304 --> 00:35:49.993
These things can come in.

00:35:50.018 --> 00:35:54.105
So be careful about it and don’t go into

00:35:54.134 --> 00:35:55.697
too many indulgences of anything.

00:35:55.722 --> 00:35:57.338
But specially with gurus.

00:35:57.362 --> 00:36:00.149
You may not like it but I have to tell you

00:36:00.887 --> 00:36:03.108
that most of these gurus

00:36:03.133 --> 00:36:07.606
who are selling religion, who are selling their methods

00:36:07.631 --> 00:36:10.496
are attacking, most of them, left hand side.

00:36:10.833 --> 00:36:13.101
There are some who are attacking also right hand side.

00:36:13.641 --> 00:36:15.616
What they do is to give you a mantra.

00:36:15.641 --> 00:36:22.392
For example somebody gives you a mantra of, say, with Shiva.

00:36:23.576 --> 00:36:27.866
Now, one does not know whether the mantra

00:36:27.891 --> 00:36:31.170
is to be said or not, where it is to be said,

00:36:31.195 --> 00:36:33.137
why Shiva’s mantra has to be given

00:36:33.162 --> 00:36:36.818
and on what Chakra it is there, for what it is to be used.

00:36:36.843 --> 00:36:38.903
They just give you: “Call the name of Shiva.”

00:36:39.243 --> 00:36:43.363
Now Shiva is the highest state, you know that.

00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:46.756
And you cannot take the name of God just like that.

00:36:46.781 --> 00:36:49.152
Supposing you have to go and see somebody here,

00:36:49.177 --> 00:36:50.905
somebody, an ordinary person.

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:54.050
Even if you have to see somebody like a minister

00:36:54.075 --> 00:36:56.138
or someone – which is nothing compared to God

00:36:56.163 --> 00:36:58.532
or even a Prime Minister is nothing compared to God –

00:36:58.557 --> 00:37:00.575
you have to take help from so many people.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.683
There is a protocol, you have to take permission then you go there

00:37:03.708 --> 00:37:05.838
But for God everybody is there.

00:37:05.863 --> 00:37:07.606
Just calling, “Shiva, Shiva, Shiva.”

00:37:07.631 --> 00:37:08.728
Is He your servant,

00:37:08.761 --> 00:37:10.115
the way you order Him about?

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.042
You look after my job; You look after this; You do this;

00:37:13.067 --> 00:37:16.129
every time you will take His name and say do this and do that.

00:37:16.721 --> 00:37:18.605
This way when you start working,

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:20.592
your left side starts getting off.

00:37:20.836 --> 00:37:25.312
Now, this is so common to give a name;

00:37:25.337 --> 00:37:27.540
even people come and ask me, “Mother give us a name”.

00:37:27.565 --> 00:37:28.722
What name?

00:37:29.021 --> 00:37:35.101
You see, the Kundalini rises according to its own condition.

00:37:35.126 --> 00:37:38.360
Supposing your Kundalini has stopped at the Nabhi Chakra

00:37:38.385 --> 00:37:42.316
then we have to take the name at the Nabhi Chakra, isn’t it?

00:37:42.341 --> 00:37:44.661
But supposing the Kundalini (is) stopping at Nabhi Chakra

00:37:44.686 --> 00:37:48.827
and you are taking the name at Agnya Chakra,

00:37:48.852 --> 00:37:50.056
what`s the use?

00:37:50.081 --> 00:37:53.001
Because your Agnya Chakra has nothing to do.

00:37:53.026 --> 00:37:57.259
Moreover, the person who is raising the Kundalini has to be authorized.

00:37:57.284 --> 00:38:02.898
He should be able to raise the Kundalini with enlightened mantra.

00:38:02.923 --> 00:38:04.316
The mantra is not enlightened –

00:38:04.341 --> 00:38:07.357
any Dick, Tom and Harry is taking God’s name.

00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:11.419
You have to enlighten your mantra. And how do you enlighten it?

00:38:11.444 --> 00:38:16.136
By becoming yourself, by becoming your Atma.

00:38:16.161 --> 00:38:19.121
When the Atma light falls in you or

00:38:19.146 --> 00:38:21.038
you emit Atma’s light,

00:38:21.055 --> 00:38:22.888
when this vibration start flowing through you,

00:38:22.913 --> 00:38:25.941
 when you get your Atmasakshatkar,

00:38:25.966 --> 00:38:30.976
then, then alone you can raise the Kundalini

00:38:31.001 --> 00:38:34.035
because then alone your mantras are enlightened.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.256
Anybody who thinks that his mantras are alright,

00:38:37.281 --> 00:38:39.341
he`s taking this mantra and that mantra,

00:38:40.009 --> 00:38:43.280
he should know that he is spoiling that particular Chakra.

00:38:43.921 --> 00:38:46.154
Supposing you are taking Shiva’s mantra,

00:38:46.179 --> 00:38:49.798
you`ll be amazed (that) you`ll be catching at the heart very easily.

00:38:50.009 --> 00:38:52.711
If you are taking Krishna’s Mantra, you`ll be amazed,

00:38:52.736 --> 00:38:56.136
you`ll be spoiling your Krishna’s place.

00:38:56.161 --> 00:38:59.236
It is such a dangerous thing to do.

00:38:59.261 --> 00:39:00.941
For example, I would say, now this is

00:39:00.941 --> 00:39:02.856
an instrument I don`t know how to handle.

00:39:02.881 --> 00:39:04.415
Now I tell you

00:39:04.421 --> 00:39:07.354
I do not know whether I have to speak from here or from there,

00:39:07.379 --> 00:39:09.216
I don’t know even if it is for speaking or not.

00:39:09.241 --> 00:39:13.216
Supposing I use this for hammering, what will happen to this thing?

00:39:13.241 --> 00:39:14.981
I have to know everything, isn’t it?

00:39:15.001 --> 00:39:16.391
I have to know the whole science.

00:39:16.416 --> 00:39:18.876
I have to know where the Kundalini is, how it is rising.

00:39:18.901 --> 00:39:21.441
The difference between other yogis and Sahaja Yogis

00:39:21.441 --> 00:39:24.341
is this that Sahaja Yogis know how to handle the situation.

00:39:24.581 --> 00:39:26.496
They know how to raise the Kundalini;

00:39:26.521 --> 00:39:28.241
they know how to put it up

00:39:28.266 --> 00:39:30.836
and they know what is the problem of others is.

00:39:30.861 --> 00:39:35.724
This is the only difference between ordinary yogis and Sahaja Yogis

00:39:35.749 --> 00:39:40.851
because the yogis that are in this world actually are very few.

00:39:40.876 --> 00:39:45.371
Those are of very great heights also do not want to come on stage.

00:39:45.396 --> 00:39:47.693
They say, “Let us remain somewhere hidden.

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:49.849
We do not want to talk to people

00:39:49.874 --> 00:39:52.242
because they will not understand us, they will crucify us.”

00:39:52.267 --> 00:39:54.267
 I have known many of them like that.

00:39:54.292 --> 00:39:55.916
They just don’t want to come.

00:39:55.941 --> 00:39:58.397
The real people are not willing to come down

00:39:58.422 --> 00:40:01.636
because they have to tell the truth and you are not going to listen to truth.

00:40:01.661 --> 00:40:04.610
You have crucified people, those who told you the truth.

00:40:04.635 --> 00:40:08.017
You like people who will pamper your ego: “Oh, you are a very nice man.”

00:40:08.541 --> 00:40:11.961
But a person who says the truth, nobody has liked so far.

00:40:12.047 --> 00:40:14.572
How have you treated other people, you know that.

00:40:14.597 --> 00:40:17.898
I need not tell you. But you dare not treat Me that way

00:40:17.923 --> 00:40:19.956
 because I know how to handle the situation.

00:40:19.981 --> 00:40:21.996
It’s a very different situation today.

00:40:22.021 --> 00:40:25.356
Even Christ could have finished the whole world,

00:40:25.381 --> 00:40:27.203
could had finished the whole world

00:40:27.228 --> 00:40:30.481
but why he did not because that drama was to be played.

00:40:30.481 --> 00:40:32.381
He just played the drama.

00:40:32.406 --> 00:40:36.270
Nobody can touch a person who is above everything,

00:40:36.541 --> 00:40:39.194
but you try to do that (and) you will be harmed

00:40:39.219 --> 00:40:43.054
and you will know that the harming will come to you in a way

00:40:43.079 --> 00:40:48.156
that your Kundalini won’t rise; nothing is going to happen to Kundalini.

00:40:48.181 --> 00:40:51.306
So, with this thing we should come to the point

00:40:51.331 --> 00:40:54.591
that the left side persons are mostly people

00:40:54.616 --> 00:40:56.930
who live in artificialities

00:40:56.955 --> 00:41:00.255
in the sense that they live with artificial thoughts.

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.933
They will be thinking in their head about the Aga Khan`s palace.

00:41:03.958 --> 00:41:07.015
Living in a hut, they will be thinking about Aga Khan`s palace

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.547
 that “Oh I am sitting in Aga Khan`s palace,

00:41:09.572 --> 00:41:12.316
this happened, that happened,” sort of thing.

00:41:12.341 --> 00:41:14.551
Not of the future that I have to live,

00:41:14.576 --> 00:41:17.277
but just “I am living there. It’s a very nice place.

00:41:17.302 --> 00:41:19.596
I am just there…” sort of thing.

00:41:19.621 --> 00:41:23.074
This is what is the problem with us

00:41:23.099 --> 00:41:25.041
that we do not want to face reality.

00:41:25.621 --> 00:41:27.887
To face reality one has to know

00:41:27.912 --> 00:41:30.032
 that it is the most beautiful thing.

00:41:30.181 --> 00:41:32.908
It is the thing that we are seeking in life.

00:41:32.933 --> 00:41:34.716
Once you have the reality,

00:41:34.741 --> 00:41:37.118
you will be so amazed at yourself,

00:41:37.143 --> 00:41:41.469
that “All this beauty and all this wealth is within me”

00:41:41.494 --> 00:41:43.593
and “Oh, no , I wasn`t aware.”

00:41:43.618 --> 00:41:46.061
Is the source of complete joy

00:41:46.061 --> 00:41:48.216
which you have to achieve, which you have to receive.

00:41:48.241 --> 00:41:49.556
That’s all within you,

00:41:49.581 --> 00:41:52.096
you don’t have to run here and run there.

00:41:52.121 --> 00:41:54.313
You don’t have to do anything of this kind

00:41:54.338 --> 00:41:57.201
which is like, as I told you,

00:41:57.201 --> 00:41:59.428
going to the collective subconscious.

00:41:59.681 --> 00:42:02.285
Now in this one, you know that in our country,

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:04.844
we have many people who try tantrikas

00:42:04.871 --> 00:42:07.396
and who go to other people like that.

00:42:07.421 --> 00:42:11.874
These are all, as I have told you, are all nothing

00:42:11.899 --> 00:42:16.368
 but smashana-vidya, preta-vidya or bhoota-vidya.

00:42:16.741 --> 00:42:20.171
But in that also what do we seek is that

00:42:20.196 --> 00:42:24.755
“What about my father, what about my mother, what about my job?” and all that.

00:42:25.365 --> 00:42:28.185
Now, these people, they may tell you something.

00:42:29.532 --> 00:42:34.569
Because these people are, have empowered some of the spirits.

00:42:34.594 --> 00:42:37.898
I am giving you all the details so that you should know all about it.

00:42:37.923 --> 00:42:39.776
They’ve empowered some spirits,

00:42:39.801 --> 00:42:43.312
they have some spirits in their hands by which they know many things.

00:42:43.337 --> 00:42:46.324
For example they will also tell you what was your father’s name.

00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:49.181
Maybe they might also tell you why you have come there,

00:42:49.206 --> 00:42:51.356
with whom you have come, your name.

00:42:51.381 --> 00:42:53.312
They will do lots of things like that.

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:56.757
But don’t run after those things, which is not important.

00:42:56.782 --> 00:43:01.147
Why should God tell you what was your father’s name or what was your name?

00:43:01.561 --> 00:43:02.714
This is a simple thing;

00:43:02.739 --> 00:43:04.551
I mean God is not going to tell you these things.

00:43:04.576 --> 00:43:08.625
What God is going to give you is the Parama, is the eternal.

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:10.552
He is not going to tell you all these things.

00:43:10.577 --> 00:43:13.610
Then also they can even tell you the name of the horse

00:43:13.635 --> 00:43:16.276
which is going to come in the races.

00:43:16.301 --> 00:43:17.916
They might tell you what is the number

00:43:17.941 --> 00:43:19.982
or other things that you do, I don’t know,

00:43:20.007 --> 00:43:23.331
some sort of what you call matkas and all that.

00:43:23.687 --> 00:43:26.836
All this nonsense is God going to do for you?

00:43:26.861 --> 00:43:30.057
What are you going to reduce God into, this nonsense?

00:43:30.082 --> 00:43:34.256
But many people, you know, indulge – that’s the sign of superficiality,

00:43:34.281 --> 00:43:35.295
they have no depth.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.059
They have no depth and they indulge into

00:43:37.084 --> 00:43:40.548
such horrible things and go and ask people such questions

00:43:40.573 --> 00:43:42.121
 that “What is going to happen?”

00:43:42.121 --> 00:43:43.923
You know, to Me also they ask.

00:43:43.948 --> 00:43:47.120
They have asked Me horse’s number, they have asked me all sorts of things.

00:43:47.145 --> 00:43:50.719
It’s most amazing, you know, and

00:43:50.744 --> 00:43:55.391
to such an extent that countries like America and Russia are indulging it.

00:43:55.416 --> 00:43:57.105
You`ll be amazed they are indulging into it.

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:59.339
And if I tell them they won’t listen, but it’s a fact.

00:43:59.364 --> 00:44:02.917
They are all indulging into you under the name of E.S.P.

00:44:02.942 --> 00:44:05.440
Once they came to me , I should say actually three of them.

00:44:05.465 --> 00:44:08.052
They are scientists or something, I don’t remember their names.

00:44:08.077 --> 00:44:11.463
But there was one Patanjali Shastri or Patanjali

00:44:11.488 --> 00:44:15.157
who was the editor in one of the magazines

00:44:15.182 --> 00:44:17.496
and he also was in ’Times of India’, I don’t know.

00:44:17.521 --> 00:44:19.095
He is the one  [unclear].

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:21.961
He brought them. But he didn’t come himself

00:44:21.986 --> 00:44:23.586
because he knew I won`t like it.

00:44:23.611 --> 00:44:25.216
And they came to me and they said, “Mother

00:44:25.241 --> 00:44:26.561
we want to fly in the air.

00:44:26.561 --> 00:44:29.236
We want to leave our body and become astral”.

00:44:29.261 --> 00:44:30.939
I said, “Why? You are all going to the moon?

00:44:30.964 --> 00:44:32.096
Now why do you want to do it?”

00:44:32.131 --> 00:44:34.756
They said,  “No Mother we must do, we must have this astral body.

00:44:34.781 --> 00:44:36.335
We want to go through the astral body

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:40.096
somehow or other help us to get this astral body thing.”

00:44:40.121 --> 00:44:42.664
I said,  “And why do you want?

00:44:42.701 --> 00:44:47.716
It is a work of a dead spirit.

00:44:47.741 --> 00:44:49.733
A dead spirit will come into you

00:44:49.758 --> 00:44:52.316
and give you this astral body formation.

00:44:52.341 --> 00:44:55.805
Now do you want some dead body to overpower you?

00:44:55.841 --> 00:44:57.016
Do you want that?

00:44:57.041 --> 00:44:59.290
You`ll be losing your freedom which you,

00:44:59.315 --> 00:45:02.416
you think is the highest thing and you will be losing that freedom?”

00:45:02.441 --> 00:45:03.956
“Yes still we will have it.”

00:45:03.981 --> 00:45:05.036
I said, “Why?”

00:45:05.061 --> 00:45:06.521
He said, “Because Russians are doing it.”

00:45:06.546 --> 00:45:09.156
I said, “Really? I didn’t know that Russians are doing it.”

00:45:09.181 --> 00:45:11.616
They said, “No, we, we must outwit them.”

00:45:11.641 --> 00:45:13.621
I said “If they are doing wrong don’t go into it.”

00:45:13.646 --> 00:45:15.816
I told them very frankly. But I don’t know.

00:45:15.841 --> 00:45:18.776
they don’t want to listen to me. This is it.

00:45:18.801 --> 00:45:20.657
We must know that when the body…

00:45:20.682 --> 00:45:23.816
You see many people have this experience of leaving the body.

00:45:23.841 --> 00:45:26.536
That is the experience of a spirit coming into you.

00:45:26.561 --> 00:45:28.161
That’s not a very good experience.

00:45:28.186 --> 00:45:31.451
But what amazed me the most in this [unclear] work

00:45:31.476 --> 00:45:35.207
this Patanjali himself was to do this – to leave his body.

00:45:35.232 --> 00:45:37.554
His wife was very much worried and this and that,

00:45:37.579 --> 00:45:39.356
and she came to me and she said that “Mother

00:45:39.381 --> 00:45:43.296
somehow save this husband of mine, I`m worried about him and this is happening.”

00:45:43.321 --> 00:45:45.044
Because she knew it was wrong

00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:47.036
and through Me she wants to cure that man.

00:45:47.061 --> 00:45:51.169
That fellow should send these people to get bhoots into them?

00:45:51.641 --> 00:45:57.192
And when they give you initiation, they initiate a bhoot into you,  them in deep.

00:45:58.088 --> 00:46:02.539
All this absurd things are done by such developed countries

00:46:02.564 --> 00:46:04.549
like India and Russia and all.

00:46:04.574 --> 00:46:05.782
Then what’s going to happen to them?

00:46:05.807 --> 00:46:09.816
They will be in the cult of satans.

00:46:09.841 --> 00:46:12.607
They will be empowered by satanic forces.

00:46:12.632 --> 00:46:16.184
How I am to tell them that don’t indulge into all these things

00:46:16.209 --> 00:46:19.376
and we are the great generators of this horrible Cult?

00:46:19.401 --> 00:46:21.136
We are exporting them.

00:46:21.161 --> 00:46:22.492
We are sending them abroad

00:46:22.517 --> 00:46:27.021
 and here also I find everywhere in every corner such tantrikas are sitting.

00:46:27.161 --> 00:46:28.667
Now we have here some people

00:46:28.692 --> 00:46:32.356
who came to me after they had such experiences of tantrikas.

00:46:32.381 --> 00:46:34.664
Their families are ruined, they are absolutely finished,

00:46:34.689 --> 00:46:37.639
they are good for nothing and they have lost their jobs

00:46:37.664 --> 00:46:41.056
and everything is finished, and tantrika is still flowering.

00:46:41.081 --> 00:46:43.856
Because for them, those who come they will exploit,

00:46:43.881 --> 00:46:45.996
again they`ll have another person, another person.

00:46:46.021 --> 00:46:48.852
That’s why I want to warn you not to indulge

00:46:48.877 --> 00:46:52.916
into such things which are wrong, which are left sided.

00:46:52.941 --> 00:46:56.030
Now the worst thing what we do very easily

00:46:56.055 --> 00:47:02.496
is, to get into left hand side, is to drink, is to drink.

00:47:02.521 --> 00:47:04.245
Now I don’t say you don’t drink

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:06.314
just now because half of you may leave.

00:47:06.339 --> 00:47:12.205
But you get your realization and then you cannot drink, even if you want to.

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:16.588
Drinking, drugging, all those things take you to the left.

00:47:17.241 --> 00:47:18.796
What happened in England?

00:47:18.821 --> 00:47:20.136
Why people started drinking?

00:47:20.161 --> 00:47:22.547
 It is not because of alcohol so much I would say.

00:47:22.572 --> 00:47:24.036
But why today?

00:47:24.061 --> 00:47:25.261
If you go in England you will be surprised

00:47:25.261 --> 00:47:28.646
half of the people are drunk in the pubs.

00:47:29.736 --> 00:47:32.471
Why it has happen there is this because

00:47:32.496 --> 00:47:35.191
they had ego oriented life, right handed.

00:47:35.216 --> 00:47:36.676
Too much ego they developed,

00:47:36.701 --> 00:47:40.656
developed such a lot of ego that they wanted to run away from their ego.

00:47:40.681 --> 00:47:41.861
So they didn`t know what to do,

00:47:41.886 --> 00:47:44.916
so their children ran away from the houses, they took to drugs.

00:47:44.941 --> 00:47:47.816
So that they run away from reality that is ego for them,

00:47:47.841 --> 00:47:51.796
they see the ego the horrid they are. The way they are oppressing others.

00:47:51.821 --> 00:47:54.601
So they want to get out of it and that’s why they are taking drugs.

00:47:55.774 --> 00:48:00.436
Now in India our young people, you see, they want to be westernized, sophisticated.

00:48:00.461 --> 00:48:01.949
Not understanding why they are drinking.

00:48:01.974 --> 00:48:04.265
They are just drinking because others are drinking,

00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:07.256
they are just taking drugs because others are taking.

00:48:07.281 --> 00:48:08.961
Because they are hippies, they think that

00:48:08.961 --> 00:48:11.637
”we should be hippies so that we will be very sophisticated.”

00:48:11.821 --> 00:48:12.821
This is a wrong idea.

00:48:12.846 --> 00:48:16.116
They are doing it out of search with intensity,

00:48:16.141 --> 00:48:19.096
they are really searching people, very deeply searching,

00:48:19.121 --> 00:48:22.544
and they give up drinks and drugs just like that.

00:48:22.569 --> 00:48:25.080
And thousands of people, in England itself,

00:48:25.105 --> 00:48:28.208
who have given up everything just like that. Overnight,

00:48:28.233 --> 00:48:30.576
overnight they have given up everything,

00:48:30.601 --> 00:48:32.945
but Indians are difficult.

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:36.414
Though they get realization very fast and they are very good at realization

00:48:36.439 --> 00:48:38.798
they lose it also very fast.

00:48:39.856 --> 00:48:43.497
The reason is because you do not know your value as Indians.

00:48:43.522 --> 00:48:46.095
I`ve being telling since yesterday that you are Indians,

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:48.173
you are greats souls to be born in India.

00:48:48.198 --> 00:48:56.396
Gregoire himself said so that you are the people who are highest in spirituality.

00:48:56.421 --> 00:49:00.076
But what’s the use of telling you when you don’t want to believe Me?

00:49:00.101 --> 00:49:05.185
It is like sometimes a beggar is told that “you are the king.”

00:49:05.856 --> 00:49:07.296
So he can’t believe it.

00:49:07.321 --> 00:49:10.843
Even if you put him on the throne, he`ll be getting up every time.

00:49:10.868 --> 00:49:13.087
He won’t believe because he`s used to begging.

00:49:13.721 --> 00:49:15.699
Even if you glue him down there,

00:49:15.724 --> 00:49:19.052
he – if anybody is passing by – will say, “Give me five rupees”.

00:49:21.961 --> 00:49:24.070
This is the way we are.

00:49:24.101 --> 00:49:25.616
We are great, no doubt;

00:49:25.641 --> 00:49:30.016
there`s nothing to be confused about it,

00:49:30.041 --> 00:49:33.416
you are great people. But we are so habituated;

00:49:33.441 --> 00:49:37.661
we have been so much put down because of three hundred years of our slavery.

00:49:37.686 --> 00:49:40.670
Then, you see, we thought we have lost faith in ourselves.

00:49:40.695 --> 00:49:42.246
We think we are poor people.

00:49:42.271 --> 00:49:44.328
I mean, what is poverty after all?

00:49:44.621 --> 00:49:47.390
What is their afluence? Is nothing but plastic.

00:49:47.464 --> 00:49:51.635
Now after all this thing, you will know who is poor and who is rich.

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:55.373
Are they… now how they are going to exist morning till evening,

00:49:55.401 --> 00:49:56.556
what are they going to do?

00:49:56.581 --> 00:49:58.651
You see, even they cannot calculate two plus two.

00:49:58.676 --> 00:50:00.878
For that also they have to use a calculator.

00:50:01.696 --> 00:50:03.116
How are they going to exist?

00:50:03.141 --> 00:50:05.596
Their brains are out, their bodies are out,

00:50:05.621 --> 00:50:10.176
they can`t walk for ten, ten minutes. They get exhausted.

00:50:10.349 --> 00:50:14.569
Thank God that we are not that rich. Thank God.

00:50:15.241 --> 00:50:19.028
That kind of an affluence has ruined them completely.

00:50:19.053 --> 00:50:21.989
Of course I don’t say that we should be beggars.

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:28.259
But think that God has saved us from many problems

00:50:28.284 --> 00:50:31.146
because we have got limited resources,

00:50:31.171 --> 00:50:32.996
we have lived with maryadas.

00:50:33.021 --> 00:50:36.414
If we did not have maryadas we would have been drinking,

00:50:36.439 --> 00:50:38.616
we would have been drinking like them,

00:50:38.641 --> 00:50:40.776
drugging, smoking, spoiling our children.

00:50:40.801 --> 00:50:42.484
The children would have been running away,

00:50:42.509 --> 00:50:45.116
wives would be running away, husbands would be running away.

00:50:45.869 --> 00:50:48.046
There would have been no society.

00:50:48.261 --> 00:50:53.231
Thank God that this limited amount that we get has delimited us

00:50:54.452 --> 00:50:58.216
and we have not crossed those things that they have crossed, those barriers.

00:50:58.241 --> 00:51:02.469
They are so foolish and so stupid and so idiotic.

00:51:03.718 --> 00:51:06.211
You may call Me that I am criticizing them

00:51:06.236 --> 00:51:09.269
but if you go and see for yourself nothing but laughing

00:51:09.294 --> 00:51:11.102
that’s the way you can live there.

00:51:11.127 --> 00:51:13.258
There are funny, funny things which I don’t know

00:51:13.283 --> 00:51:15.596
how to tell but there’s more[unclear] of people also,

00:51:15.621 --> 00:51:19.903
but when you go there you`ll be amazed how the people are there.

00:51:19.928 --> 00:51:22.043
You are much more wise.

00:51:22.068 --> 00:51:26.271
But in one thing you are lacking behind

00:51:26.295 --> 00:51:29.476
that is their young people are really seekers.

00:51:29.501 --> 00:51:33.062
They are not fashionable about it. We are fashionable about seeking.

00:51:33.087 --> 00:51:35.962
That’s not so. I would say, especially in England,

00:51:35.987 --> 00:51:39.503
I feel the young people of England are really wonderful beings.

00:51:39.528 --> 00:51:41.871
They are the best young people you can think of,

00:51:41.896 --> 00:51:46.103
I mean in England. If you see the quantity of them is much more.

00:51:46.128 --> 00:51:48.788
Of course we have very good seekers in other way also.

00:51:48.821 --> 00:51:53.516
The quantity of very deep seekers are in English people

00:51:53.541 --> 00:51:56.472
and young people they are very different from the English people

00:51:56.497 --> 00:51:58.557
we knew, just the opposite of them

00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:01.829
and this is something such a remarkable thing that

00:52:01.853 --> 00:52:05.346
tomorrow they might come here to teach you who is Adi Shakti,

00:52:05.346 --> 00:52:06.639
what is Adi Shakti.

00:52:08.174 --> 00:52:10.723
This is where we are today.

00:52:10.747 --> 00:52:16.374
We have no depth of any kind left in us because all of us have problems.

00:52:16.399 --> 00:52:18.585
We have no significance in life.

00:52:18.605 --> 00:52:21.725
We think we are useless; we are so confused about it.

00:52:21.742 --> 00:52:23.848
So, again I would request you

00:52:23.881 --> 00:52:27.966
to seek your [not clear] that you do not unnecessarily put yourself down

00:52:27.991 --> 00:52:32.203
and think that you, you are looking [not clear] you are apart, all these things.

00:52:32.228 --> 00:52:35.468
You are very much [unclear]. Some of you do not get realization.

00:52:35.493 --> 00:52:37.868
First there are something wrong with your chakras,

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:39.943
 [unclear] somewhere which are very good tomorrow.

00:52:39.968 --> 00:52:41.983
Very clearly I will be talking about it.

00:52:41.991 --> 00:52:45.402
Any gentleman who doesn’t want to face the truth leave that hall.

00:52:45.427 --> 00:52:47.490
But you can not [unclear] Me from talking.

00:52:47.517 --> 00:52:50.882
That’s one thing for definite those who want to face the truth

00:52:50.907 --> 00:52:53.797
without feeling bad about it sit down here.

00:52:53.822 --> 00:52:57.234
I would also request you if possible we have a book

00:52:57.259 --> 00:52:59.115
very well written by Gregoire

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:02.720
which is what I`ve told them, just due charges we have put on that.

00:53:02.745 --> 00:53:04.828
That is because it’s a very big book.

00:53:04.837 --> 00:53:07.552
It costs you about fifty rupees or something like that.

00:53:07.577 --> 00:53:10.189
Just the printing because I said no profit is to be made,

00:53:10.214 --> 00:53:12.740
I am very particular on that point, extremely particular.

00:53:12.741 --> 00:53:15.074
That’s how it’s just the printing charges

00:53:15.099 --> 00:53:18.046
that you should take after this program

00:53:18.071 --> 00:53:19.456
or before this program

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.961
and go through it and see for yourself

00:53:21.967 --> 00:53:24.008
how the seeking works out.

00:53:24.403 --> 00:53:28.852
Now we have here today this program and tomorrow again

00:53:28.877 --> 00:53:31.493
I`m going to speak to you about (the) other two channels

00:53:31.499 --> 00:53:33.837
but you know that these things take time.

00:53:33.837 --> 00:53:37.324
First of all tomorrow I`ll be speaking about Ganesha center

00:53:37.349 --> 00:53:40.213
and I will speak about the right hand side channel

00:53:40.238 --> 00:53:41.722
which you [unclear] clean.

00:53:41.745 --> 00:53:45.461
With this channel you develop the balloon of psyche

00:53:45.472 --> 00:53:47.180
which is called as a mana.

00:53:47.203 --> 00:53:49.968
So when we say that ‘mere man ne yeh kaha’

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:53.494
you should know that it may be somebody else coming in.

00:53:54.065 --> 00:53:56.831
So in our country you see that`s a regular thing

00:53:56.843 --> 00:53:59.206
 [not clear – hindi sounds like ‘jab udhar man chahta nahin toh tuh door baith jaa’].

00:54:00.026 --> 00:54:03.330
We want to guard ourselves against the mana’s dictation.

00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:06.450
We do not allow ourselves to drift into that mana’s state

00:54:06.481 --> 00:54:08.213
but if you start drifting into mana…

00:54:08.238 --> 00:54:09.865
Now he`s bringing tea,

00:54:09.877 --> 00:54:11.822
this is what I wanted to see… we are so frivolous.

00:54:11.823 --> 00:54:14.804
If somebody is bringing the tea, a little child is coming in, we must see.

00:54:14.817 --> 00:54:16.393
Everything we must record.

00:54:16.405 --> 00:54:19.279
Are we here sitting like Sarva Lokiteshvara

00:54:19.299 --> 00:54:21.671
that sitting, everything must be watched, anything.

00:54:21.683 --> 00:54:24.604
You see, on the way when people go, I`ve seen in India especially,

00:54:24.629 --> 00:54:26.476
all the advertisements must be there.

00:54:26.501 --> 00:54:29.115
If one is missing they`ll stop the car and read it.

00:54:30.756 --> 00:54:33.182
unclear

00:54:33.207 --> 00:54:35.343
So, I am saying it’s a very serious thing.

00:54:35.379 --> 00:54:38.845
It’s a very serious thing and it's valued.

00:54:39.136 --> 00:54:43.083
I`m speaking before you [UNCLEAR]

00:54:43.095 --> 00:54:44.625
I know you are,

00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:47.987
but if your attention is in the dust

00:54:48.025 --> 00:54:49.116
what am I to do?

00:54:49.141 --> 00:54:51.796
Your attention has to be there,... that’s all.

00:54:51.821 --> 00:54:52.904
Then I’ll manage it.

00:54:52.929 --> 00:54:54.763
be surprised that how much powers are there

00:54:54.771 --> 00:54:57.719
that how much powers are there, behind you.

00:54:57.744 --> 00:55:01.233
That all that is you I am going to tell you each and everything

00:55:01.258 --> 00:55:03.092
 ‘guptatara guptatam’

00:55:03.117 --> 00:55:06.181
everything that is not so far revealed to you

00:55:06.206 --> 00:55:10.503
only thing is keep yourself in the center.

00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:13.645
Today please go and buy some photographs,

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:16.165
I don’t know if they are selling the photographs. They are simple things,

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:21.481
just buy them and meditate this evening.

00:55:21.506 --> 00:55:24.711
Again tomorrow you come and we are going to again

00:55:24.736 --> 00:55:26.717
have a meditation thing.

00:55:26.742 --> 00:55:29.408
The more you expose to it, the better it will be.

00:55:29.433 --> 00:55:31.528
Go deeper into it, deeper into it.

00:55:31.553 --> 00:55:34.618
And then you will know what all these great saints

00:55:34.643 --> 00:55:35.947
and prophets have said.

00:55:35.972 --> 00:55:42.641
All the scriptures that have described that “to know yourself” is the aim of everything.

00:55:43.241 --> 00:55:44.630
May God bless you.

00:55:45.721 --> 00:55:49.175
Seeker: But we have seen you, we have seen you face to face.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.929
By using you, purchasing your photo…

00:55:51.954 --> 00:55:54.536
So in what way your photo is going to help us?

00:55:54.561 --> 00:55:57.486
Now, photo is a very authentic thing.

00:55:57.511 --> 00:56:01.436
You see, so far all the murtis and everything are not so authentic.

00:56:01.461 --> 00:56:03.670
Because there is vibrations passing through Me…

00:56:03.695 --> 00:56:05.446
I`ve discovered to My great amazement

00:56:05.471 --> 00:56:08.116
and joy that My photo has the same vibrations.

00:56:08.141 --> 00:56:10.916
So if you use the photograph you can work it out.

00:56:10.941 --> 00:56:12.286
If you don’t want to use the photograph

00:56:12.311 --> 00:56:13.976
it doesn’t work out to begin with.

00:56:14.001 --> 00:56:16.640
To begin with there is an aalamban of my photograph.

00:56:16.665 --> 00:56:19.100
But what is, why should you have objection to my photograph?

00:56:19.125 --> 00:56:21.701
If you could have Me there, why can`t you have My photograph?

00:56:21.726 --> 00:56:23.879
Supposing you have anybody`s photograph.

00:56:23.904 --> 00:56:27.211
See, you will have even Indira Gandhi’s photograph.

00:56:27.236 --> 00:56:29.511
You have everybody`s photograph. Why not Mine?

00:56:29.536 --> 00:56:31.726
What’s such an objection about Me? About it?

00:56:31.751 --> 00:56:33.150
I don’t understand.

00:56:33.175 --> 00:56:34.868
You’ll be amazed it emits cool vibrations.

00:56:34.893 --> 00:56:36.461
You see, this is the trouble.

00:56:36.486 --> 00:56:38.603
You`ll have everybody’s photograph.

00:56:38.627 --> 00:56:40.815
All kinds of nonsensical people you`ll have photograph.

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:43.046
Seeker: We got your vibration right now?

00:56:43.057 --> 00:56:46.500
Right now, but when you will work on the photograph you will feel deeply.

00:56:46.511 --> 00:56:48.561
You see, because photograph will remain with you,

00:56:48.586 --> 00:56:50.305
you just try what I`m telling you.

00:56:50.316 --> 00:56:52.839
You just try what I`m telling you, you see

00:56:52.855 --> 00:56:55.772
by that I am not going to get anything, again.

00:56:55.781 --> 00:56:59.227
You see, you are used to a shopping spirit.

00:56:59.538 --> 00:57:02.201
You always do something as if you are shopping.

00:57:02.226 --> 00:57:04.226
Here you are not shopping.

00:57:04.251 --> 00:57:07.462
You are taking it. I`m giving.

00:57:07.582 --> 00:57:10.199
You are not giving Me anything, you cannot give.

00:57:10.224 --> 00:57:12.422
I am at a point where you cannot give Me.

00:57:12.447 --> 00:57:15.465
So you take it and how to take is very embarrassing

00:57:15.479 --> 00:57:17.048
but I have to tell you how to take it.

00:57:17.073 --> 00:57:19.896
I`ll have to also tell you how to sit before Me.

00:57:19.921 --> 00:57:22.625
What to do? You are such small children, you do not know.

00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:27.504
Maybe by doing certain things you may spoil your vibrations.

00:57:27.517 --> 00:57:30.108
You must know how to respect your Mother.

00:57:30.278 --> 00:57:32.315
If you do not know, all of them are within Me,

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:34.871
all these great saints are sitting with Me.

00:57:34.896 --> 00:57:36.658
They will not like it, you see.

00:57:36.683 --> 00:57:38.029
So I have to tell you even that.

00:57:38.034 --> 00:57:40.494
Today only I was telling, its very embarrassing that

00:57:40.519 --> 00:57:43.519
I have to tell everything to them. Somebody I went to,

00:57:43.519 --> 00:57:46.144
they, they wanted to give me water.

00:57:46.169 --> 00:57:48.967
You see, they gave me in a plastic glass.

00:57:49.325 --> 00:57:50.812
I said it’s alright

00:57:50.837 --> 00:57:52.556
if they give Me in plastic glass.

00:57:52.581 --> 00:57:54.290
But it’s not all right otherwise.

00:57:54.315 --> 00:57:55.357
You must understand.

00:57:55.382 --> 00:57:57.900
This is not the way to give water to your Mother

00:57:57.907 --> 00:57:59.152
who is a Divine person.

00:57:59.177 --> 00:58:01.927
But you didn’t know, I am not saying anything, but respect.

00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:04.087
You just get some dirty glass and give it to Mother,

00:58:04.112 --> 00:58:05.690
is not the way it is to be done.

00:58:05.715 --> 00:58:07.431
You see, you must understand after all you

00:58:07.456 --> 00:58:09.806
come from a country which has samskaras,

00:58:09.828 --> 00:58:12.596
which knows what is a puja, what is a holy person

00:58:12.621 --> 00:58:13.940
is and everything is.

00:58:13.953 --> 00:58:17.267
And then when you know that, you should understand

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.217
that this is very important for that

00:58:19.221 --> 00:58:20.846
whatever is needed has to be done.

00:58:20.853 --> 00:58:23.115
If you have a photograph of a wrong person

00:58:24.148 --> 00:58:25.906
your, house will be ruined.

00:58:26.359 --> 00:58:28.440
Even [unclear sounds like ‘diamond’] you have seen it happens.

00:58:28.446 --> 00:58:31.012
If you have the photograph of a holy person,

00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:32.828
everything will be alright.

00:58:32.852 --> 00:58:35.696
It is for your good. I am not going to gain anything out of it.

00:58:35.696 --> 00:58:37.685
And photograph is not that expensive

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:40.012
that you should think about. First we start, just have.

00:58:40.037 --> 00:58:42.375
It`s the minimum price, I think one Rupee.

00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:45.217
If you can afford it I`ll be happy. Thank you.
