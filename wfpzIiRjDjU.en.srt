00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,486
Easter Puja, Hounslow, UK - 1985-0408

2
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:09,751
Happy Easter to you all.

3
00:02:11,251 --> 00:02:16,761
So we celebrate Easter

4
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:22,675
to show how Christ resurrected, resurrected Himself.

5
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:30,189
The spirit that is Christ has to resurrect

6
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:43,387
out of the material manifestation of the divine itself.

7
00:02:43,588 --> 00:02:51,521
The matter is manifested,

8
00:02:51,721 --> 00:03:01,395
because we ourselves have created it.

9
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:10,367
Not that we are born out of matter, our body,

10
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:16,887
but we are attached to it, we want it, we want to have it.

11
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:26,762
Whatever you want, that sustains itself by your desire,

12
00:03:26,962 --> 00:03:31,272
because now you are on the stage.

13
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:35,358
If you want to sustain the matter,

14
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:41,408
if you want to keep the matter as the first priority,

15
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:45,827
it will remain.

16
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:49,833
It cannot disappear.

17
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:54,012
It has to go out of your mind,

18
00:03:54,212 --> 00:03:58,754
that matter cannot hold you any further.

19
00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:05,429
Christ rose out of the matter, came out
of the tomb which symbolises the matter

20
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:10,632
which has enclosed us within,

21
00:04:10,832 --> 00:04:15,979
which has to be opened out with our spiritual power.

22
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:20,507
Throw away, throw away the stone that is covering this grave.

23
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:30,299
Get out of that and stand outside it.

24
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:35,749
This is the message of Christ’s resurrection.

25
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:42,719
The tomb that we have created, we have created ourselves,

26
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:51,338
because we have allowed people to dominate us.

27
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:59,977
We have allowed them to make these graves for us,

28
00:05:00,177 --> 00:05:08,425
we have allowed them to bury Christ within ourselves,

29
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:13,664
because we were afraid.

30
00:05:17,238 --> 00:05:22,918
But Christ has to rise.

31
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:28,236
So we create our own matter through our conditionings,

32
00:05:28,436 --> 00:05:34,221
through our fears, through our absolute wrong ideas

33
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:40,205
about goodness and kindness and compassion.

34
00:05:41,212 --> 00:05:45,341
In the light of the Spirit, you can see what we think as compassion

35
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:55,676
is nothing but a kind of sympathy which leads you nowhere.

36
00:05:59,445 --> 00:06:03,284
But one should learn to see everything in the light of the Spirit.

37
00:06:03,484 --> 00:06:09,124
But do we use all the time the light of the Spirit? We do not.

38
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:16,167
For Christ, it was not difficult, because He was the Spirit.

39
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:20,244
But He has shown you the way.

40
00:06:20,444 --> 00:06:25,884
He crucified Himself to show you the way.

41
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:32,692
All the ideas about sophistication,

42
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:39,625
about our standing in the society,

43
00:06:39,825 --> 00:06:46,722
how we relate ourselves to other dignitaries or to our country,

44
00:06:46,922 --> 00:06:54,276
to our politics, to our economics and the world at large,

45
00:06:54,476 --> 00:07:00,362
all of them can tie us down to that tomb.

46
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:05,342
You belong to another category, I’ve told you a hundred times.

47
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:10,282
And a category which is the Spirit,

48
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:17,910
which can rise above all the tombs, can throw away everything.

49
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,433
This way you are conditioned.

50
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:24,683
All absurd ideas have been accepted,

51
00:07:24,883 --> 00:07:31,355
which you cannot explain why you were conditioned like this.

52
00:07:33,735 --> 00:07:38,280
Why I talk more of conditioning? Because of England.

53
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,110
English are very much conditioned people.

54
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,610
The others are Americans who are abandoned.

55
00:07:43,845 --> 00:07:45,948
I mean, you cannot talk to them about anything

56
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:50,025
because they cannot be rooted into anything.

57
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:52,611
But the English are too much conditioned people,

58
00:07:52,811 --> 00:07:59,205
and when they are too much conditioned, they build their own tombs.

59
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,677
All these ideas are to be seen

60
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:09,903
with a new dimension of awareness that you have.

61
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:14,915
You are the Spirit.

62
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,373
Why should you worry about anything else

63
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:24,527
but your vibrations?

64
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:26,724
Because you are saints.

65
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:32,047
You should just worry about the comfort of your Spirit.

66
00:08:32,247 --> 00:08:37,101
Whatever is congenial to your Spirit, just go on doing that,

67
00:08:37,301 --> 00:08:42,237
observing that, accumulating that and sucking within yourself.

68
00:08:42,437 --> 00:08:44,468
All conditionings will run away.

69
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:46,669
Because these conditionings you accept,

70
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:52,911
because they look comfortable, they look comfortable, but they are not.

71
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:01,282
Christ is a great example and if He is the one whom you follow,

72
00:09:01,482 --> 00:09:05,188
if He is the one you have understood and recognised

73
00:09:05,388 --> 00:09:07,774
in the light of your Spirit,

74
00:09:07,974 --> 00:09:12,183
then you must know why did He go into the grave first of all.

75
00:09:12,383 --> 00:09:14,714
The Man who was so powerful,

76
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:21,499
Who when He will come He’ll reduce all of them into ashes,

77
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:25,077
such a great personality like Him of Ekadasha Rudra.

78
00:09:25,277 --> 00:09:29,382
Why did Christ

79
00:09:29,582 --> 00:09:34,361
allow Himself to be crucified and to be buried into that?

80
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:41,330
Because He wanted to stoop down to the level of other people,

81
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,419
to come down to that level so that people should see that

82
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:50,903
through His life, they are shown that you can be resurrected.

83
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:54,274
Now the Resurrection has taken place.

84
00:09:54,474 --> 00:10:00,998
Sahaja Yogis are resurrected no doubt, but still one foot is in the grave.

85
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:07,488
And the second one I do not know whether it will be out or in,

86
00:10:07,688 --> 00:10:12,117
it is just halfway through.

87
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:20,122
One foot is of course outside, no doubt,
but still is not yet touching the ground,

88
00:10:20,322 --> 00:10:23,466
and the other cannot be lifted unless you push the ground,

89
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:29,676
this matter, again, to push it up.

90
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,319
If you live with your Spirit, you should have no fears,

91
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,839
you should have no worry.

92
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:43,404
See now, I will tell you how God is showing His ways, here.

93
00:10:43,604 --> 00:10:50,646
Like in Durham, the fellow is now under complete fire,

94
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:55,220
he does not know what to do and he himself is so stupid,

95
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:59,720
as Sanskrit saying in is that "Vinash Kale Viprita
Buddhi." "When your destruction time comes,

96
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,976
you think of all perverted things", vipareet Buddhi.

97
00:11:04,176 --> 00:11:10,258
So his tongue if you, I mean see to
the way he speaks, I mean, blasphemous.

98
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:13,987
And he is under fire; he himself lit the fire

99
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:17,706
and is now sitting on top of it. And now when he gets the heat,

100
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:22,706
the heated words come out of his mouth.

101
00:11:22,906 --> 00:11:25,857
We don’t have to do anything; it is all done, already.

102
00:11:26,057 --> 00:11:31,979
They are baked and cooked in their own...

103
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:41,533
So why should we have fear?

104
00:11:41,733 --> 00:11:47,150
But we should know what is right and what is wrong.

105
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:51,263
That is only possible because you are with the Absolute

106
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:54,844
that is the Spirit. And related to the Absolute,

107
00:11:55,044 --> 00:11:58,383
if you do everything related to it, you are doing the right thing.

108
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,914
If you are related to Christ, how can you do wrong?

109
00:12:02,114 --> 00:12:06,565
That is one of the proofs that they are not Christians of any kind,

110
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:11,245
because none of the Christian organisations have done anything good,

111
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:19,136
whatsoever, except for creating fire for themselves.

112
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:23,749
So you can see clearly how this conditioning

113
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:29,386
has worked within us, because
we have been so-called Christians,

114
00:12:29,586 --> 00:12:33,541
we have been going to churches, we have been worshipping Christ as they told us,

115
00:12:33,742 --> 00:12:41,376
the way they told us we worshipped
Him, everything regimented.

116
00:12:45,168 --> 00:12:51,062
The One who came to resurrect us from the bondage of the grave,

117
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:56,585
we used Him to build our graves.

118
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:07,464
Now you are out of it, thank God, but take out the other foot, fast.

119
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:14,392
This is one advantage you have because you have Christ before you,

120
00:13:14,592 --> 00:13:20,343
but also there is a disadvantage because Christ has been used

121
00:13:20,544 --> 00:13:24,215
to set you down in the grave.

122
00:13:24,416 --> 00:13:27,022
So change your concept about Christ,

123
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:31,934
know Him through your vibrations, what He was.

124
00:13:32,134 --> 00:13:36,543
I mean, as a child I knew what was going wrong with Christians

125
00:13:36,743 --> 00:13:39,230
and left and right, little girl like Me about seven years,

126
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,793
I used to give big lectures.

127
00:13:42,993 --> 00:13:46,027
Even when I was baptised, I was horrified.

128
00:13:46,227 --> 00:13:51,774
The way I was baptised by some stupid fellow.

129
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:56,551
I did not know what was he up to.

130
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,554
And then he put a bhoot on my head, I think,

131
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:03,613
or something which hovered round and we met with a very big accident,

132
00:14:03,814 --> 00:14:06,328
I fell down.

133
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:11,094
This bhoot must have put it in the horse, I feel, or somewhere,

134
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:13,305
another bhoot.

135
00:14:13,505 --> 00:14:17,516
This priest, the stupid fellow, he belonged to the Lutheran Church.

136
00:14:17,716 --> 00:14:20,146
I don’t know what you call that. Lutheran, imagine,

137
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:23,761
Martin Luther’s Church.

138
00:14:23,961 --> 00:14:26,675
And that is how they baptised me.

139
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:34,494
I knew all about it, but I did not know what
to do. I must have kicked him quite a lot.

140
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:42,835
But whatever it is, so-called, he baptised me.

141
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:46,696
I had to accept all foolish stupid things in this life,

142
00:14:46,896 --> 00:14:49,524
because I had to show I was quite normal.

143
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:56,672
I mean, being accepting stupid is normal these days.

144
00:14:56,872 --> 00:15:00,645
And to tolerate an idiot is even more normal.

145
00:15:00,846 --> 00:15:05,680
So I had to show that. I knew very well what sort of a thing it was,

146
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:16,707
this fellow was up to, and I accepted the nonsense he did

147
00:15:16,907 --> 00:15:24,514
and many other things I accepted just
to show that I am nothing special.

148
00:15:24,714 --> 00:15:29,487
But I knew all about it.

149
00:15:29,687 --> 00:15:33,929
When I saw the way Christ was described, I was aghast.

150
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:36,898
I said "what are they doing to Christ?".

151
00:15:37,098 --> 00:15:43,945
I mean, nicely second crucifixion going on.

152
00:15:44,968 --> 00:15:49,789
You also know about it.

153
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:54,396
Thank God there are so many to whom I can talk

154
00:15:54,596 --> 00:16:00,166
and they understand my language.

155
00:16:00,747 --> 00:16:03,532
But the Resurrection will not be complete unless and until

156
00:16:03,732 --> 00:16:08,360
you pull out many out of their graves.

157
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,777
I don’t know how you will go about it.

158
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:14,355
Look at this fellow Durham gets such a publicity

159
00:16:14,555 --> 00:16:16,562
when he is doing all blasphemous things.

160
00:16:16,763 --> 00:16:21,267
He is getting all the credit and kudos from people. What about us?

161
00:16:21,468 --> 00:16:26,344
What are we doing?

162
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:31,090
Why not we write to the newspapers? Why not we talk to them?

163
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,328
"Observer" has given us a clue, I think. There is one gentleman,

164
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:36,699
Mr. Wilson, who wrote quite nice things.

165
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,636
Why not write to him some letters?

166
00:16:39,836 --> 00:16:43,946
Get to it.

167
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:59,692
Because, you see, what I am a little concerned about this matter is,

168
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:02,897
as it is they are half-hearted creatures.

169
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:05,161
Now, if this Durham fellow speaks like that,

170
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:08,010
who is now the big authority on Christianity, Christ,

171
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:12,668
His Mother and every body else, Mr. Durham.

172
00:17:12,868 --> 00:17:15,278
And now this fellow if he goes on like this,

173
00:17:15,478 --> 00:17:20,364
those who are half-baked will fall off to Communism,

174
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:24,952
and the rest of them who may remain also,

175
00:17:25,152 --> 00:17:29,199
they may accept him.

176
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:38,023
So the Anglicans, the Anglo-Saxon brain, I am saying,

177
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:42,586
is going to accept Mr. Durham very well, I can see that.

178
00:17:42,786 --> 00:17:46,373
Or else will just leave and become communists.

179
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:53,248
Have nothing to do with this God who has so many problems.

180
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:59,087
So in the Seminar of yours in Birmingham when you have,

181
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,352
I would like you to think over this new thing

182
00:18:02,552 --> 00:18:07,165
that has come up in the heart of the Universe.

183
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:09,664
Everyone knows about Durham fellow,

184
00:18:09,864 --> 00:18:12,500
they know he is blight, everything.

185
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,297
But what about us? We are so many, let us try to find out

186
00:18:16,497 --> 00:18:20,590
how we can talk to these people sensibly,

187
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:24,933
talk to these Anglicans, find out about them,

188
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:29,412
and communicate to them what you have found out.

189
00:18:29,612 --> 00:18:32,357
You need not say in the beginning only that I am the Adi Shakti

190
00:18:32,557 --> 00:18:39,044
or I am the Redeemer and the Comforter, that Christ has said.

191
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:43,506
But we can start talking about it. Find out these people,

192
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:47,980
these Anglicans, church people, churchgoers who believe in God,

193
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:52,797
who believe in Christ.

194
00:18:55,383 --> 00:18:58,608
I mean they are voting. Can you imagine?

195
00:18:58,808 --> 00:19:05,417
They are voting whether Christ was true or not. Can you vote like that?

196
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:12,884
You feel you are in a lunatic asylum or what? It is terrible!

197
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:19,846
They are taking votes, can you imagine such a thing like that?

198
00:19:22,282 --> 00:19:24,895
At this moment we have an advantage,

199
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:27,506
because they are so much confused, to give them a concrete idea

200
00:19:27,706 --> 00:19:33,585
as to what is God, what is Christ, what is religion.

201
00:19:33,785 --> 00:19:37,413
One side I feel very hurt and unhappy, I think,

202
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:42,291
these three days l have gone through real Resurrection myself.

203
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:47,579
The way things have been about Christ,

204
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:53,389
just I can’t bear it, I mean, it is too much.

205
00:19:54,382 --> 00:19:59,604
You all should be stirred also, should be concerned.

206
00:19:59,804 --> 00:20:05,786
And you must go through it and see what you can do and tell them:

207
00:20:05,986 --> 00:20:11,539
"Are you all mad or what? Why don’t you listen to sanity?"

208
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:16,120
As you know, when I went to Australia,

209
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,414
it is a different country altogether.

210
00:20:18,615 --> 00:20:23,551
They are much more sensible people than you are.

211
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:25,770
I think the way they were exiled,

212
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,309
they learnt a lesson and they are better.

213
00:20:28,509 --> 00:20:33,106
So I feel the English have to go into exile

214
00:20:33,306 --> 00:20:39,473
or jail for a while to understand, deserve it.

215
00:20:39,673 --> 00:20:42,664
They are very sensible, extremely sensible people.

216
00:20:42,864 --> 00:20:46,999
You can talk to them, sense. Everyone.

217
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,289
The media is sensible, the people are sensible.

218
00:20:50,489 --> 00:20:53,433
Thousands of them came. They repeated.

219
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:59,081
First programme we had once, it was 1 600, 2000.

220
00:20:59,281 --> 00:21:05,752
Can you imagine such people? And out of them repeats were 600.

221
00:21:05,952 --> 00:21:09,264
Now for the last how many years, we are having the same 600 people

222
00:21:09,465 --> 00:21:12,224
again and again? What Seminars are we going to do?

223
00:21:12,424 --> 00:21:18,169
All of us sitting and cooking some chicken, that’s all.

224
00:21:21,164 --> 00:21:27,589
Or making some cake for Mother which She doesn’t eat.

225
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:35,557
Let us take out our satisfactions from these
little, little things into some thing bigger.

226
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:42,549
Let us talk about it, without fear.

227
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:46,871
We have to go and talk and tell people about it.

228
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:52,020
Take it a big way.

229
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,621
There should be no hindrance on this part.

230
00:21:55,822 --> 00:21:58,066
We are a very big group and we can assert

231
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:03,551
and we can talk and meet people.

232
00:22:08,343 --> 00:22:12,276
The situation has improved a lot,

233
00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:19,740
because now I have to go to India as you know,

234
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:27,094
and in India, for me, the situation is much better.

235
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:29,782
It is not at all difficult.

236
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:37,597
As you know, I went to the hills at the foothill of Himalayas.

237
00:22:37,797 --> 00:22:40,019
About 3000 people came from all over,

238
00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:44,793
the little, little villages that they had.

239
00:22:44,993 --> 00:22:47,295
They didn’t take even a second to recognise me,

240
00:22:47,495 --> 00:22:52,145
they were singing the praise of the Goddess of the Hills,

241
00:22:52,345 --> 00:22:56,336
Goddess of the Tigers, Goddess of the Lions.

242
00:22:56,536 --> 00:23:00,219
They just started singing my praise.

243
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:03,563
Without any lecture or anything. They were all joyous

244
00:23:03,763 --> 00:23:07,077
that I have been there and they knew and they accepted Me and finished.

245
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:12,039
And I just had to put my foot
down there and I have done.

246
00:23:12,239 --> 00:23:19,810
Jaipur, they said, "Mother you just put your foot here", really!

247
00:23:20,804 --> 00:23:23,902
So for me the situation is very good in India.

248
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:27,010
Now let’s see what you people are going to do

249
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,389
with these big big Seminars and lectures.

250
00:23:31,589 --> 00:23:35,842
Why not get some outsiders to listen to you?

251
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:39,490
Invite them.

252
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:45,709
Invite these intellectuals.

253
00:23:47,185 --> 00:23:52,636
Try to talk to them, tell them what is it.

254
00:23:52,836 --> 00:23:57,379
What do you call them, those who know about Bible?

255
00:23:57,579 --> 00:24:01,219
Theologics.

256
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:07,564
Theologics, theo - what logians? Without logics!

257
00:24:07,764 --> 00:24:09,462
Theologics.

258
00:24:09,662 --> 00:24:14,469
Call these Theologians, challenge them.

259
00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:19,942
Why not put a challenge?

260
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:26,812
You are not alone, you are so many.

261
00:24:28,226 --> 00:24:34,818
And don’t tell them that you wear saris when you come for my Puja.

262
00:24:35,018 --> 00:24:40,592
They won’t understand it, they are not that deep.

263
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:45,642
You can wear your jeans.

264
00:24:45,843 --> 00:24:51,721
Or to convince them more, you can be punks.

265
00:24:52,989 --> 00:24:58,309
That would appeal to them better. You go with your punky conditions,

266
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:05,008
they will jolly well have to listen to you, otherwise they are in for trouble.

267
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:10,725
If they are that stupid, why not handle them?

268
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:15,259
It is very easy to handle a stupid person than to handle a person

269
00:25:15,459 --> 00:25:19,275
who is not stupid, or who is clever.

270
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:26,618
Stupid can be stupefied very easily.

271
00:25:29,447 --> 00:25:31,826
So I think we have to change our course, we have to take it

272
00:25:32,026 --> 00:25:35,762
in a big way, the whole thing, what we are going to do.

273
00:25:35,962 --> 00:25:38,371
All of you should give some concrete ideas

274
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:43,074
as to what you would like to do.

275
00:25:43,274 --> 00:25:47,130
And that would be really the way it will work out.

276
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:50,248
So now in the Seminar you must discuss more

277
00:25:50,448 --> 00:25:56,079
how to talk to these people,

278
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:01,009
how to create a platform for Sahaja Yoga.

279
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:08,983
Find out how do they create a platform out of nothing, like these punks.

280
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,191
And once you do all these things,

281
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:21,490
you will be surprised that they will have to listen.

282
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,358
They will have to listen to you.

283
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:29,186
Now go full ahead. I am giving you all freedom, do what you want.

284
00:26:29,386 --> 00:26:32,221
Except for telling them I am Adi Shakti,

285
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:34,436
that they will not be able to digest,

286
00:26:34,637 --> 00:26:37,783
that an Indian has now become the Adi Shakti.

287
00:26:37,983 --> 00:26:43,770
They think now Adi Shakti has to be an English lady.

288
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:48,854
At least, French.

289
00:26:57,637 --> 00:27:00,898
So don’t mention me. If you want you can,

290
00:27:01,098 --> 00:27:04,062
but don’t mention me as Guru or anything, but you should say:

291
00:27:04,262 --> 00:27:07,404
"She is the lady who has shown us the way" or something like that,

292
00:27:07,604 --> 00:27:11,537
not referring much to me, but to them.

293
00:27:11,737 --> 00:27:14,381
I think you should go ahead with it and work it out,

294
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:16,813
because we have now had a lot of patience,

295
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:20,209
now all nonsense going around us, better tell them.

296
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:25,641
Or are we going to allow all of them to go to hell direct?

297
00:27:25,841 --> 00:27:31,038
Message of Easter. East, comes from East.

298
00:27:31,238 --> 00:27:34,251
I don’t know why they call it Easter.

299
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:37,995
Have you ever thought of it?

300
00:27:38,195 --> 00:27:42,003
Why do they call it a Worcester Sauce, I don’t know.

301
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:44,268
I don’t know why they call anything anything.

302
00:27:44,468 --> 00:27:50,787
But Easter,

303
00:27:50,987 --> 00:27:53,599
you can’t explain, you know.

304
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:57,443
Like "curved screen", you don't know.

305
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:03,820
So I don't know, but Easter, it is coming from the East.

306
00:28:04,484 --> 00:28:10,362
The wisdom has to come from the East, the
Resurrection has to come from the East,

307
00:28:10,562 --> 00:28:14,713
whether they like it or not.

308
00:28:16,252 --> 00:28:19,443
And that is the message of Easter today:

309
00:28:19,643 --> 00:28:24,368
that let us give them the chance of resurrection

310
00:28:24,568 --> 00:28:27,829
by talking to them, all of you.

311
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:30,026
Should make it a point, go and talk to people

312
00:28:30,227 --> 00:28:33,792
who are in charge of theology, churches, Bibles.

313
00:28:33,992 --> 00:28:37,492
Go and talk to them, tell them:"What are you doing? Are you mad?

314
00:28:37,693 --> 00:28:40,940
Why you want to die? Why do you want to be sleep people.

315
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:46,239
You don’t know anything."

316
00:28:47,574 --> 00:28:51,164
Another thing I would suggest that we should have regular classes,

317
00:28:51,364 --> 00:28:53,867
to understand Sahaja Yoga properly.

318
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:57,012
I have seen some people who are Sahaja Yogis for years

319
00:28:57,212 --> 00:29:03,754
don’t know anything about Sahaja Yoga.

320
00:29:03,954 --> 00:29:06,348
Even in Bombay, people told that:

321
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:10,539
"Some of the ladies are absolutely zero as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

322
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:12,754
They don’t understand what is Sahaja Yoga is,

323
00:29:12,955 --> 00:29:17,466
they don’t understand what is - what are the chakras are.

324
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:20,115
They listen to your lecture, everything, and then like a bubble,

325
00:29:20,315 --> 00:29:22,584
the whole thing disappears from their minds."

326
00:29:22,784 --> 00:29:25,716
I don’t know who gave them these ideas, but they were quite shocked.

327
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:29,060
So let us have a class-like thing for Sahaja Yogis

328
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,758
to different topics and subjects, let us work it out.

329
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:38,352
Recently you must be knowing, there is a book going to be published by

330
00:29:38,552 --> 00:29:42,426
Yogi Mahajan called ‘Gita Enlightened’ which is a very good book.

331
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:46,682
Of course, I mean, most of it, I have helped him, he has been with me and all that,

332
00:29:46,883 --> 00:29:50,463
but doesn’t matter, but he has understood
the subject. The other day they published

333
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:54,047
a very beautiful book in Marathi.

334
00:29:54,247 --> 00:29:57,726
One Suravkar, such a learned book he wrote

335
00:29:57,926 --> 00:30:02,570
that in the light of Gyaneshwara, what is Sahaja Yoga.

336
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:08,048
And he has written it so well that anybody who is a theologian

337
00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:12,549
or anything, like in India, will be impressed by it.

338
00:30:12,749 --> 00:30:15,385
I wish I could translate that book for you.

339
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:21,266
But it is all the stanzas from Gyaneshwara,

340
00:30:21,466 --> 00:30:26,005
which is in Marathi language. He
wrote such a nice book on Sahaja Yoga

341
00:30:26,205 --> 00:30:29,445
and that is what he gave on my birthday this time,

342
00:30:29,645 --> 00:30:34,734
something so substantial, I felt.

343
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:38,315
And once it reaches into the hands of any one of these people,

344
00:30:38,515 --> 00:30:43,961
I mean, it will in any case.

345
00:30:44,906 --> 00:30:48,342
And he published himself, he brought some copies, gave it to me.

346
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:51,178
And all the copies were sold out in that programme,

347
00:30:51,378 --> 00:30:56,432
every copy was sold out for Rs. 2 each.

348
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,298
So this is what we have to do now, is to write,

349
00:31:01,498 --> 00:31:03,938
write to different magazines, meet people,

350
00:31:04,138 --> 00:31:06,212
tell them we want to come and talk to you.

351
00:31:06,412 --> 00:31:08,821
First of all you must know about Sahaja Yoga.

352
00:31:09,021 --> 00:31:11,021
You should be well equipped.

353
00:31:11,222 --> 00:31:15,110
It’s not that you can show my photograph with a light here.

354
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:20,941
That is not sufficient. What is the light here, also you have to show.

355
00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:23,375
Only a few people know what is Sahaja Yoga,

356
00:31:23,576 --> 00:31:26,839
the rest of you don't know anything.

357
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,240
Let us see what questions we have in our minds.

358
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:35,756
Let us sit down and find out: "What are the questions?"

359
00:31:35,956 --> 00:31:38,029
"What questions are we lacking in?"

360
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,204
"What we have to understand in Sahaja Yoga? What part we don’t know?"

361
00:31:41,404 --> 00:31:45,161
Let’s find out all those things, all the details. Let us write it down.

362
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:50,207
Everyone of you. Whether it’s a woman, man, child, everyone can do it.

363
00:31:50,407 --> 00:31:53,121
Find out: "What are the questions

364
00:31:53,321 --> 00:31:56,313
which are not yet answered in Sahaja Yoga?"

365
00:31:56,513 --> 00:32:00,883
"How can we answer particular questions?"

366
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:03,641
Alright? All these things can be found out.

367
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:07,680
If you put your attention to it, you can easily find out what you need.

368
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,352
Everyone has to do it. You must all be equipped.

369
00:32:11,553 --> 00:32:13,720
If anybody asks you a question on Sahaja Yoga

370
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:17,775
and you cannot answer, I mean, how can you convince people?

371
00:32:17,975 --> 00:32:22,228
You take one ordinary so-called layman from Christianity,

372
00:32:22,428 --> 00:32:24,428
so-called Christianity again,

373
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:28,700
the man is layman and the Christianity is also lay.

374
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:33,523
He will give you a big lecture on Christ.

375
00:32:33,723 --> 00:32:36,304
Every verse in the Bible, he will tell you:

376
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:42,328
"Chapters, Matthew 2, Verse 2, this is what Christ has said.

377
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:45,994
That "you will be calling me Christ, Christ and I will not recognise you",

378
00:32:46,194 --> 00:32:51,796
telling about himself only.

379
00:32:54,916 --> 00:32:58,599
So you have to be absolutely equipped for it.

380
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,185
Now you have to also know what you will confront

381
00:33:01,385 --> 00:33:03,943
in a particular country. For example, when I come to England,

382
00:33:04,143 --> 00:33:08,668
I know I have to confront these theologians and the Christ and everything.

383
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:11,377
If I go to India, what I have to confront I know.

384
00:33:11,578 --> 00:33:17,921
I have to face it on different lines and different fronts.

385
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:20,275
You don’t have to do that.

386
00:33:20,476 --> 00:33:22,883
Just think about your own country. For French, you have to think

387
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:27,820
about France, you people have to think about this country.

388
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,020
And then go ahead with it.

389
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:34,174
You can chalk out a good programme and work it out properly.

390
00:33:34,374 --> 00:33:36,586
I am sure, by God’s grace, everything will work out.

391
00:33:36,786 --> 00:33:39,662
Because when I am going to do it now?

392
00:33:39,862 --> 00:33:42,201
I’m going away, as I told you, to India,

393
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:45,279
and I don’t know when will I be back. You wanted to arrange

394
00:33:45,479 --> 00:33:49,961
my programme in England, but I think I cannot do it,

395
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,782
because I have to go round to all the places, Europe and all that,

396
00:33:52,982 --> 00:33:57,024
finish that. You’d better do that touring.

397
00:33:57,224 --> 00:34:04,066
When I was not here, what touring did you do?

398
00:34:06,141 --> 00:34:09,250
Nothing.

399
00:34:10,925 --> 00:34:15,740
You could have toured. Now at least, these three months,

400
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,983
when we are having a nice summer time,

401
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:21,642
I’ll be travelling all over Europe, everywhere.

402
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:24,892
You please see that you go round England.

403
00:34:25,092 --> 00:34:28,095
Visit different places, arrange programmes, talk to people,

404
00:34:28,295 --> 00:34:31,012
find out who are the big Johnnies there.

405
00:34:31,212 --> 00:34:37,754
The mayors, this, that, go and talk to them, tell them about this.

406
00:34:37,954 --> 00:34:41,266
That is how new programming should be done and a new dimension

407
00:34:41,466 --> 00:34:45,014
should be given to our Sahaja Yoga propaganda.

408
00:34:45,214 --> 00:34:49,302
You have done no propaganda in the right sense, in the sense that

409
00:34:49,503 --> 00:34:52,755
we were not so much sure about it, that we’ll work out.

410
00:34:52,956 --> 00:34:55,987
But now we will, because people are writing,

411
00:34:56,187 --> 00:35:00,906
there is an atmosphere against Christ, so we have to fight.

412
00:35:01,106 --> 00:35:07,195
And that is how we should become the people who are fighting for Christ.

413
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:11,307
Now there could be areas where you can talk of integration,

414
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:15,526
of talking about how we do not know much about Christ.

415
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:18,698
That we have to go to other books to find out who He was.

416
00:35:18,898 --> 00:35:21,849
Why did He come on this earth? We have to go much deeper.

417
00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:24,036
We have to prove that there is Divine power.

418
00:35:24,236 --> 00:35:27,090
And you have seen how Divine power works, what wonders there are.

419
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,025
You take my photographs. Show them: "These are the photographs,

420
00:35:30,226 --> 00:35:33,999
can you explain these things? That in the hand you see the sun?

421
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:41,719
Show us in Mrs. Thatcher’s hand, even a star won’t twinkle."

422
00:35:43,828 --> 00:35:48,128
These things are to be seen in the right perspective

423
00:35:48,328 --> 00:35:52,865
and at the right time. We must do whatever is right at that point.

424
00:35:53,065 --> 00:35:55,072
That is the way Sahaja Yoga is.

425
00:35:55,273 --> 00:35:59,854
Hit the point when it is to be hitten.

426
00:36:00,584 --> 00:36:03,186
If you cannot do that way, you cannot achieve it.

427
00:36:03,386 --> 00:36:06,214
So this is the right time for you, there are now

428
00:36:06,415 --> 00:36:09,866
3 months ahead of you, I would like you to see what you can do,

429
00:36:10,066 --> 00:36:14,852
because now the sun will be coming out,

430
00:36:15,052 --> 00:36:17,258
you will have a nice summer.

431
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:20,914
Go ahead. But now just do not fix all your holidays

432
00:36:21,114 --> 00:36:25,409
during these three months going to some beach somewhere.

433
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:29,933
Sahaja Yogis have no time. They are busy people.

434
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:33,804
They have no time to waste.

435
00:36:34,004 --> 00:36:42,759
We are on a warpath, we have no time
to quarrel among ourselves, fight.

436
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:47,189
We have to fight very great enemies.

437
00:36:47,389 --> 00:36:50,786
We have no time to waste on our families and our children

438
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:54,926
and our relations and father, mother, sister, brother.

439
00:36:55,126 --> 00:36:58,848
We are on a warpath, very important it is.

440
00:36:59,048 --> 00:37:04,618
So let us now prepare ourselves.
As Christ stood out of that grave,

441
00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:11,826
let us get out of this grave of lethargy, of compromising, of comfort,

442
00:37:12,026 --> 00:37:18,539
of our past ideas about life’s pleasures.

443
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:24,851
This is the new era that has to show,

444
00:37:25,052 --> 00:37:29,780
it’s manifestation in this country.

445
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,452
It is very important, and you all can do it.

446
00:37:32,652 --> 00:37:36,463
You have to be very brave, you have to be sensible, wise,

447
00:37:36,663 --> 00:37:39,946
kind and also forthright.

448
00:37:40,147 --> 00:37:44,041
But you have to say what you have to say, because it has to be said.

449
00:37:44,241 --> 00:37:48,244
And this is the only thing to be said, nothing else is important.

450
00:37:48,444 --> 00:37:51,354
Whatever these people talk about has no meaning.

451
00:37:51,554 --> 00:37:55,487
They are not mantras.

452
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:59,119
Some of them are anti-God, some may not be,

453
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:03,612
but they are useless, wasteful, garbages I should say.

454
00:38:03,812 --> 00:38:08,889
Why they are given so much importance and not the real thing that is there?

455
00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:17,759
You understand that this is the reality that has come into you people.

456
00:38:17,959 --> 00:38:21,595
Actually you have felt the reality.

457
00:38:21,795 --> 00:38:25,403
Actually you know the reality,

458
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:31,368
you are in the reality, then why not talk about it?

459
00:38:33,173 --> 00:38:35,093
Why should we not?

460
00:38:35,293 --> 00:38:40,734
Is it not the most important thing that we have to do?

461
00:38:40,934 --> 00:38:43,687
If you realise it, I am sure it will work out.

462
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:47,721
With all my blessings, with all my love,

463
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:50,924
I really command you to do that now.

464
00:38:51,124 --> 00:38:55,865
May God bless you.

465
00:38:59,633 --> 00:39:02,316
Today, on this day you all should vow,

466
00:39:02,516 --> 00:39:06,066
vow that "we are on the warpath and we are going to find out

467
00:39:06,266 --> 00:39:08,331
ways and methods of doing these things,

468
00:39:08,532 --> 00:39:13,592
for these three months, we are going to work it out". Just vow.

469
00:39:13,792 --> 00:39:20,865
Just ask for wisdoms and the spiritual power, that’s all.

470
00:39:24,475 --> 00:39:32,907
And promise it to Christ that "as You did, we are going to do".

471
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:49,376
May God bless you.
