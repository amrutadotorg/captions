1
00:00:05,473 --> 00:00:08,610
But what is the nature of innocence?

2
00:00:08,713 --> 00:00:14,153
That we can understand from Shri Ganesha's innocence.

3
00:00:14,513 --> 00:00:22,433
First of all He's endowed with wisdom,

4
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:29,273
and He puts wisdom into us.

5
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:37,313
It's a nice thing now in modern times we have discovered genetics,

6
00:00:38,313 --> 00:00:44,793
and genetics determine our behavior and our races.

7
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:51,913
It is He who puts genetics in us.

8
00:00:53,873 --> 00:00:59,873
He selects and puts it within us, our genetics,

9
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:08,833
and when He puts wisdom in us, then we are wise.

10
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:15,393
There is definitely a genetic of wisdom

11
00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:20,472
which is lacking, as we can see very clearly, in many races.

12
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:22,352
They have no wisdom.

13
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:25,952
They do things without wisdom.

14
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:31,592
They do things just for their destruction, destroying their society.

15
00:01:31,673 --> 00:01:35,072
They may call themselves the highest society, highest races,

16
00:01:35,153 --> 00:01:37,632
whatever it is - you may brand yourself with anything;

17
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:40,152
but you can see from their behavior they're,

18
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:43,913
that they have no wisdom at all.

19
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:51,113
So He's the one who puts that wisdom in us.

20
00:01:51,953 --> 00:01:54,232
In some people who are not yet evolved,

21
00:01:54,313 --> 00:01:57,472
certain races are not yet evolved to that extent,

22
00:01:57,553 --> 00:02:00,793
this wisdom is lacking.

23
00:02:01,593 --> 00:02:10,553
Apart from that, this wisdom gives us the sense of freedom.

24
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:19,404
So we keep aloof from all kinds of intoxicant,

25
00:02:19,913 --> 00:02:23,523
all kinds of bad habits.

26
00:02:23,673 --> 00:02:28,115
We don't like to look at nudity.

27
00:02:28,393 --> 00:02:35,077
It can never become lifestyle of people who have wisdom - never.

28
00:02:35,913 --> 00:02:41,945
We don't indulge into extramarital nonsense.

29
00:02:42,273 --> 00:02:49,460
Whatever is absolutely in the center, which is dharmic, we accept.

30
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:55,536
So we can see that the seed of wisdom put into us

31
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,759
makes us dharmic people when we grow, automatically.

32
00:03:00,845 --> 00:03:04,846
We are automatically dharmic.

33
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:08,518
So this wisdom is innate,

34
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:13,037
just happens that when the kundalini is rising

35
00:03:13,118 --> 00:03:17,757
He becomes, manifesting in us -

36
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:23,037
I mean, I should say, He makes us like a child.

37
00:03:23,118 --> 00:03:27,294
And that's what Christ has said, that you have to be like children

38
00:03:27,398 --> 00:03:31,717
if you have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

39
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:34,517
You become the child,

40
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:37,397
at that time you become a child.

41
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:43,717
And with the kundalini rising,
that wisdom then comes into your brain,

42
00:03:43,798 --> 00:03:46,614
because He's sitting on the kundalini itself.

43
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:49,997
He's the power in the kundalini.

44
00:03:50,078 --> 00:03:52,837
He gives wisdom in the brain.

45
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:58,437
Once you get that wisdom, you drop out all bad habits,

46
00:03:58,518 --> 00:04:02,797
all your attachments which are wrong,

47
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:09,437
all adharmic things that you do, everything drops out.

48
00:04:09,518 --> 00:04:12,317
He changes, your genetics are changed.

49
00:04:12,398 --> 00:04:16,197
The genetics of Sahaja Yogis are, all of them will be the same,

50
00:04:16,278 --> 00:04:18,877
about the same I would say,

51
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:25,437
and the genetics of other people would be different.

52
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:28,477
Maybe Indians might have closer to it,

53
00:04:28,558 --> 00:04:31,661
because Indians normally are very wise people.

54
00:04:31,742 --> 00:04:34,310
They won't -- I mean, I would say, if you see

55
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:39,357
the superiority of races from wisdom 
point of view, Indians are very wise.

56
00:04:39,438 --> 00:04:43,251
They won't just do some nonsensical things at all, no question.

57
00:04:44,298 --> 00:04:49,041
I've tried to give you some points about Shri Ganesh.

58
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,427
I think even if you give Me hundred lectures I cannot finish it,

59
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:56,041
it's so great, it's like an ocean to Me.

60
00:04:56,122 --> 00:04:59,867
So I hope you will understand the essential,

61
00:04:59,948 --> 00:05:03,561
the fundamental principles of Shri Ganesha,

62
00:05:03,642 --> 00:05:08,482
and what is innocence is. The first is wisdom.

63
00:05:13,002 --> 00:05:15,668
May God bless you all.
