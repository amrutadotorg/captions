00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.241
Without the left side right
side is very dangerous.

00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:17.991
If you don’t have right side of course

00:00:18.783 --> 00:00:23.866
it’s a big dangerous thing
also. But first you must have

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:27.991
development of your left side.

00:00:30.158 --> 00:00:34.287
That is what, to begin
with, we had in Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:42.158
Left side is compassion,
is love, universal feeling,

00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:48.908
or we can say it’s the blessings of the Devi

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.953
which are described you
know it, in the Devi Mahatmyam,

00:00:55.033 --> 00:01:00.558
that the Goddess resides
within you as so many things.

00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:05.068
She resides within you as shraddha.

00:01:05.908 --> 00:01:10.033
as, She resides in you as sleep,

00:01:11.658 --> 00:01:15.287
She resides in you as illusion, bhranti.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:19.287
All kinds of things are
there on the left-hand side,

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:22.283
which are already described.

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:28.036
And when I told you about Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:28.116 --> 00:01:31.949
I wanted to make your left side very strong.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.900
So Kundalini, when it is arisen,

00:01:38.983 --> 00:01:42.941
the best thing is to go to the left side,

00:01:44.816 --> 00:01:50.112
not criticising others, not talking ill of others,

00:01:50.192 --> 00:01:53.108
but seeing within you, what’s wrong.

00:01:55.358 --> 00:02:00.484
Find out what is the matter with you.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.250
First it starts with self-importance,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.736
that “I am a very important person,”

00:02:08.816 --> 00:02:12.320
and with this self-importance you go on

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.820
troubling everyone and
torturing everyone, and all that.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.736
But because of your right-side movement,

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:23.986
you can become very successful.

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:26.941
Hitler was the climax of that.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.900
And that’s how people start
taking to very, very cruel things.

00:02:36.858 --> 00:02:41.941
Nowadays, I think that some people are

00:02:44.775 --> 00:02:50.816
ruling everywhere with their right side.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.992
We do not have people
who are using their left side.

00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:07.145
And whenever they use their
left side they are called as saints.

00:03:07.885 --> 00:03:12.195
Now you all have the powers of the left side.

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:17.897
Some of you do have little bit
right side also, doesn’t matter.

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:25.438
Now I would say that you have achieved

00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:27.976
your left side mastery:

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.584
Kundalini awakening is there,
you are one with the Divine.

00:03:33.664 --> 00:03:39.456
Now you can come to the right
side and know about right side,

00:03:40.816 --> 00:03:44.816
and try to express your right side.

00:03:46.317 --> 00:03:51.511
You can express it not by dominating
others but dominating yourself.

00:03:51.591 --> 00:03:54.195
By self-examination.

00:03:54.275 --> 00:03:59.820
By understanding what’s wrong
with you. Why do you behave like that?

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.265
Why do you trouble others?
Why do you overpower others?

00:04:06.345 --> 00:04:10.093
Such people will always, I have seen, organise

00:04:10.173 --> 00:04:14.112
and arrange, and do this and do that.

00:04:14.192 --> 00:04:18.820
Instead of organising
themselves they’ll organise others.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.233
These things complicate.

00:04:23.816 --> 00:04:28.861
But if you have love and if you have bhakti,

00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:31.941
you can very, very easily

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:41.025
dominate others in a very different manner.

00:04:43.317 --> 00:04:50.233
It is not that you dominate by cruelty,

00:04:52.108 --> 00:04:58.066
by oppression, but you dominate with your love.

00:04:59.941 --> 00:05:02.861
And you don’t want to dominate,

00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:06.861
but easily people get very much succumbed

00:05:06.941 --> 00:05:12.941
to love and to magnanimity, to generosity.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.903
So all these qualities you
must first develop within yourself:

00:05:18.983 --> 00:05:24.986
is the left-side problem, that –
you should be very peaceful,

00:05:25.066 --> 00:05:29.820
you should give love to
others, you should be generous,

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.941
you should be kind, and see how much it means.

00:05:36.484 --> 00:05:41.358
I’ve seen some people who are extremely rude,

00:05:43.358 --> 00:05:47.820
they can be rude to anyone, that’s their nature,

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.695
which they should overcome with the left side.

00:05:51.775 --> 00:05:55.903
Rudeness is not the sign of a saint.

00:05:55.983 --> 00:05:59.028
A saint is extremely peaceful,

00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:02.275
and never gets rude with others.

00:06:03.025 --> 00:06:06.695
So the introspection should work first of all,

00:06:06.775 --> 00:06:11.112
“Where are we wrong?
What wrong things we are doing?

00:06:11.192 --> 00:06:13.066
What is our style?”

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.404
Once you discover that
your style is already left-side,

00:06:18.484 --> 00:06:21.467
then you should take to right side

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:24.380
and possess the power of right side.
