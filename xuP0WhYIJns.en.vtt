00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.230
If you've come here to disrupt the making then I have a right to have you removed

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.019
If you've come here to listen and then to ask questions when the question time comes up fine

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.739
But let's not let's not peddle our own bicycles because you have a particular problem

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.680
Now I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.610
Am standing and walking around here four years ago. I walked with a brace I

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.180
Had a belt

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.699
And my leg was in a caliper

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.850
Because I had had a prolapsed disc in my spine

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.649
Which caused my sciatic nerve to flatten and I lost the use of my right leg. I

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.469
Am not claiming that sahaja yoga was totally responsible

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.669
For my present condition because I know there would be regeneration

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.719
But the best medical advice you can get will tell you that that regeneration does not continue

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.420
Much beyond 18 months

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.939
It is still continuing. I

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.539
Have a daughter I'm speaking in the first person because I don't see any point in talking about other people

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.019
I have a daughter who was a heroin addict

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.909
She gave up heroin in two weeks

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.358
After she got what she mother calls her self-realization

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.739
She is now married she has one child and another one expecting and she has totally changed

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:02.749
That came about

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.229
Not through some mumbo-jumbo not through some

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.969
curious form of standing on your head and doing strayed yogic practices, but simply by getting her self-realization and

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.030
concentrating on the perfection of herself

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.840
That is what sahaja Yoga is about

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.329
We are all human beings. So in sahaja yoga from time to time, of course

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.480
We have clashes. We have people who don't agree. We have people who for various reasons

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:44.120
Are asked to leave as I say you cannot join. Sahaja. Yoga. You can only practice it. Please come

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.529
If you are living in a house madam and

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.700
You are not

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.349
conforming to the way other people in that house wish

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.410
to live together

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.740
Calm form not perform form if you are living in a house with other people and they consider that you are

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.600
Addressing them and be careful Jenny because I have someone in the audience that you aggressed

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.200
Fact she's just coming in now

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.140
There is a question time, there is a question time after

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.539
We expected this as you can see this is why the gentlemen of the press are here I

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.979
Am sorry for those of you who came to hear about sahaja yoga

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.170
It is one of those things

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:06.070
We have no control over because this is a public meeting and if people choose to come here and disturb it

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.000
Until they make themselves until they make it quite clear that they intend to disturb and disrupt the meeting

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
We cannot ask them to leave so

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.530
If you will bear with them

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.010
We will try and continue to tell you something about sahaja yoga I

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.070
Am living proof that things can happen

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.780
physically to you

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.780
That wouldn't otherwise be

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:41.439
Expected my daughter is similarly some someone who has overcome a problem

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.260
that is threatening large sections of

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.239
Our young community and it was done through self-realization

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.880
What is this self-realization?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.089
basically, if you look at this character here behind me, you will see at the base of the spine a

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.749
Triangular bone it was called the sacrum

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.489
Interesting word because it means sacred

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.469
Within that sacrum bone

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.130
There resides a residual power

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.639
Which has been lying rather like a seed that lies until it is put in the earth

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.189
until such a time as the time we live in

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.550
when

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.479
Through a mechanism, which I don't tend to understand

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.950
through the agency of someone like Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:38.979
this mechanism

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.800
is activated

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.610
When this mechanism is activated

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.690
The the force if you like the force be with you the force

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.880
Passes up the

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.800
central nervous system

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.030
and

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:04.000
Believe it or not and many of you. I hope will experience it tonight if we don't have too many interruptions

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.260
You actually feel a

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.179
Sensation in your hands and on the top of your head in the form of a coolness

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.760
Now that sounds wild

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.540
Highly unlikely, but in fact it happens

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.859
When this hat that is a signal to you on your central nervous system

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.889
That something unusual has taken place

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.950
in terms of

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.310
yoga

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.310
in terms of what Yoga means

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.120
That is a union or a connection

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.150
if you like

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:46.989
That television camera over there is a remarkable piece of modern-day technology

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:55.360
But until they plug it into their battery power the package doctor, I don't know whether that's what it is or into the

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:03.279
Into the PowerPoint on the skirting board over there. It really is a useless pile of junk now

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.440
We're not a useless pile of junk

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.870
But we are

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.149
At a point in our evolution where unless something happens and there's something changes

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.200
We're not going to survive

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.470
Because we live in a world that is

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.370
distrustful

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.370
We live in a world that is

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.749
Unable to tell the difference between truth and falsehood

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:31.400
and

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.600
so

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.600
We are on a merry-go-round

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.730
We don't seem to be able to get out of the of the the

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.780
Continuing cycle of

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.390
kill or be killed

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.640
Put down will be put down

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:56.340
Sell or die, you know, we we have to change the world is getting fuller and full of people. Oh

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.509
For goodness sake will you please keep quiet I

00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:05.009
Am speaking for myself I

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.860
Don't know what's got into you I

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.879
Noticed you're wired for sound

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:30.299
This lady is wired for sound you will be pleased to know she has a microphone on her lapel

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:33.778
Which is so that everybody can hear what she has to say

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.979
You can tell from that you can tell from that that she has come

00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:43.648
Deliberately to disrupt this meeting. I want you to know that now

00:08:45.519 --> 00:08:48.448
So whatever she says or does you can expect

00:08:55.570 --> 00:09:00.209
These seven colored balls there represent

00:09:02.529 --> 00:09:09.599
The subtle plexuses in the body they are wherever there is a nerve plexus there is the subtle plexus alongside it

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.249
They reflect our attitudes and our behavior

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.610
The heart is the center of security

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:27.060
And it is isn't it if you get a fright you go and you can feel your heart race

00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:32.639
There are several medical practitioners

00:09:34.089 --> 00:09:40.318
In sahaja, yoga mainly in the United Kingdom and they're doing research into this for instance

00:09:40.319 --> 00:09:45.689
They have discovered please you will have your time to ask questions afterwards. Let's be fair

00:09:47.589 --> 00:09:49.589
They have discovered

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:57.949
That a high proportion of women who have breast cancer have husband trouble

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.850
And now this obvious, isn't it

00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:07.939
It's affecting their security. I mean, there are people down here who don't believe that but that's immaterial

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:11.059
They'd office Lee don't believe a lot of other things

00:10:12.029 --> 00:10:16.249
If your security if your security is yes similar

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.980
Coming to that

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:25.279
If your security is threatened this Center, which is the

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.240
Got the name of it the

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:32.779
The plexus I'm speaking of the physical plexus

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.149
It affects your lungs. It affects the heart rate it affects your

00:10:39.149 --> 00:10:46.249
Well-being in the sense that if your security is sufficiently threatened you start to exhibit a disease

00:10:47.579 --> 00:10:53.359
It has thrown your whole system out of balance and what sahaja yoga is talking about is balance

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:56.389
If you can keep in balance

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:03.829
Then you will have a fairly healthy life. There are still accidents you can still

00:11:06.089 --> 00:11:08.359
Unfortunately get in the way of

00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:14.328
Disease but generally speaking. You'll find you're much more resistant

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:16.740
We're not saying that sahaja

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:21.829
Yoga is the cure or all of all things you still we still have a long way to go, but it is

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.939
in essence the next step that we must take

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:30.050
If we are going to progress in our evolution

00:11:30.839 --> 00:11:32.790
Some of us will not

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:34.790
some of us will choose not to

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:38.989
But nonetheless others will like to and we'll try

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:43.249
one of the things that Shri Mataji is is

00:11:44.459 --> 00:11:46.459
very often says

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:50.539
Is that you must look at this thing like a scientist

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.479
You don't have to believe what I say

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.889
You don't have to believe what shri mataji says, but it is fair to listen

00:11:58.259 --> 00:12:03.049
And it is fair to look at it and see whether there is any truth in it

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:06.139
To see whether it works

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.740
And if it works

00:12:09.259 --> 00:12:14.859
Well, then why not give it a try you're not gonna lose anything she doesn't require money for it I

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:18.490
Beg your pardon

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.610
Yes, indeed

00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:26.319
There's no particular brand of in spiritual

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:32.289
Spiritual enlightenment is spiritual enlightenment. Are you trying to divide up the I

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.050
Didn't say it was a religion

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.279
It is a way to improving yourself it is a way to

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.249
developing yourself in your evolution

00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:56.829
It is a connection with the all-pervading power that obviously makes the world tick

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.209
If you have experienced it you would understand

00:13:04.209 --> 00:13:10.719
It's very difficult to explain to people what I'm talking about in this if you have never understood if you have never had this experience

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:12.879
it is almost impossible to

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.699
Expect you to understand if I wanted

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.860
You have the opportunity you

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.550
Have the opportunity

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.659
Whether or not you succeed of course is up to you entirely I

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:39.880
Can't explain to you what fish tastes like if you've never eaten fish. I

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:42.909
Can tell you roughly speaking what it is

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:49.540
But you have to experience it and what we're basically talking about now is a physical manifestation of something

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:52.390
That occurs

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.930
These people are sitting there with notes you can see how well-prepared they're oh

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:05.620
Thank you posterity the

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:13.180
Questions will come later. There is always a time. Would you please keep quiet there is always a time

00:14:21.769 --> 00:14:26.439
We really did come here to talk to people about sahaja yoga and what

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:32.500
Spiritual enlightenment is all about we didn't really come here to talk to armored cars in drag

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.680
Now I

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:10.869
Don't understand why you people don't get a hall and invite people to come to explain what your problems I

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:13.570
haven't any money

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:16.510
No, it's not I have no money

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:25.329
There's no organization, there are a lot of people in the organization who put up money to hire this hall is that wrong

00:16:38.189 --> 00:16:42.409
- what Shri Mataji has to say there will be a question time after

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:49.219
If you insist on interrupting, then I will ask the security people to remove you

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.100
We're entitled to do that

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.230
you've had a fair go - now I

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.909
Think you would all agree with me that they've had a fair go

00:17:06.779 --> 00:17:10.819
Shri Mataji Nirmala, Devi is here to explain to you

00:17:13.559 --> 00:17:15.559
What is the truth

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:18.829
Truth is felt on your nervous central nervous system

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:26.179
It's not something you have to believe it's not something that somebody else has told you

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.630
It is something that happens

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:36.830
And no amount of talking or shouting from the auditorium will make any difference truth is truth

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.850
And because we are such a

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.200
Skeptical people

00:17:45.779 --> 00:17:52.129
But it's not and I mean people in the in the human race. I'm not talking about Australians or anybody else. It's not surprising that

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.939
Pilate said to Christ what it's truth

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.110
It's not at all surprising

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:05.929
Because there are always people shouting you down when you speak the truth

00:18:09.059 --> 00:18:11.059
Tonight you will hear the truth

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:20.809
Tonight Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi will tell you the truth. She will give you the truth

00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.109
I hope you listen

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.920
Was that I

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.659
I Bow to all the seekers of truth

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.300
Now we have

00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:26.820
The knowledge with us through science and through other enterprises

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:36.450
About the Tree of Life, which is outside, but when it comes

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:41.010
To the roots of the tree

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.399
We have to understand it has to be a settler knowledge

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.760
And found here

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:53.820
something wrong

00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:06.019
Nice

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.480
The part

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.460
Some mischief has been done

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:22.330
That's and elate always I thought really something back in Adelaide

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.650
Special place I was

00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:48.699
I bow to all the seekers of truth

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.469
We know the truth about the Tree of Life

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:04.990
Through our search in science and other enterprises we have taken -

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:10.840
But still we have to find out our roots

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.900
Unless and until we find out our roots we

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:21.039
Cannot nourish this tree of life

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.849
This trail of life has grown

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:28.930
Beyond the

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:35.589
Supply of energy that can come from the roots

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.250
But as the tree grows

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.460
Also the roots grow

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:47.379
Downward and in that search

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:54.100
I've been lucky enough to find out a method to give an R mass

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.750
That subtle thing called as the spirit

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.080
The spirit is your own

00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:11.230
Is the God Almighty reflected in your heart he resides in your heart all the time

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.860
He watches you

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:21.669
But he doesn't come into action he doesn't come into

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:25.570
Your attention

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:36.360
The power of God is the Holy Ghost is the desire of God

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:46.409
To take you into his kingdom that is reflected in this triangular bone

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.240
Called as sacrum

00:24:52.899 --> 00:24:54.899
Surprisingly this bone

00:24:55.570 --> 00:25:01.169
Was known to the Greeks that's why they called it sacrum meaning sacred

00:25:03.549 --> 00:25:09.268
Greeks came quite close to the search of research of truth

00:25:10.749 --> 00:25:12.899
But suddenly, I don't know what happened to them

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.600
That they also started

00:25:16.179 --> 00:25:17.470
going

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.709
outward became extroverts

00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:23.759
I've been to Greece and I have seen

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:28.379
Attends itself means primordial mother Athena

00:25:29.799 --> 00:25:33.089
In Sanskrit language, it's called other means primordial

00:25:36.999 --> 00:25:38.999
In the same way

00:25:39.970 --> 00:25:41.679
So many great

00:25:41.679 --> 00:25:43.679
prophets incarnations came

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.210
on this earth to

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:49.740
Tell you that you have to become the spirit

00:25:53.529 --> 00:25:56.189
Even in Quran in the very beginning of it

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.720
It is written that you have to be connected to God

00:26:02.139 --> 00:26:05.878
Without connection to the God or his power

00:26:07.539 --> 00:26:09.539
You cannot

00:26:09.879 --> 00:26:11.879
Talk about God

00:26:12.519 --> 00:26:19.679
You cannot understand God and if you try to do anything you become aggressive

00:26:21.009 --> 00:26:23.639
dominating and ultimately throughout

00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:34.049
But just think of please let me finish madam just a minute just a minute have patience

00:26:35.169 --> 00:26:41.249
There's no need to be so disturbed. This is a place. We are trying about our self-realization

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:47.059
You two have got it within you you two have got that spirit within you be patient

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:53.540
Better know your own property slowly be patient. I am not taking away anything from you. Just be patient

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.040
All right. No use being aggressive, please please, please

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:06.950
Please please please no, this is I can't hear you. What's the use now? Let us be you see this is the trouble

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:10.430
You need really?

00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:13.939
In marathi tea said tell Appa. He did za TT

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.240
To get to realization

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.680
You have to have people of quality and a calibre

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.219
Superficial cheap people cannot get realization

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:28.790
In the olden times in India

00:27:30.090 --> 00:27:34.550
They gave self-realization to one or two persons one or two persons

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.469
At the time of Rama there was one fellow called Nachiketa

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:46.490
who came to nanika two who came to Janaka the father-in-law of Rama who was a great Saint and

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.280
Asked me asked him sir

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:53.089
Will you give me realization? He said ask me the whole world?

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:56.450
That I can give you but not realization

00:27:57.540 --> 00:27:59.810
He had to go through severe tests

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.589
Then self-realization was granted

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:13.940
But and when I was born I found the world is in a complete chaos

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:17.570
People have no time and

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:21.679
There are so many useless people in this world

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:26.539
that they are the murmuring souls as described by Christ and

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:32.479
They will spoil all the rest of them and there won't be any chance for them to

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:41.420
Take to a lengthy process of self-realization that one by one I clear the chakras

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.969
So very assiduously, I studied the problems of human beings I

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.109
Was amazed that modern human beings

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.800
Are very complicated?

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.980
Much more complicated than what people wear

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:06.649
I was telling I was told that some very good Christians came in Adelaide to

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.399
Settle down here, but they are no more

00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:18.620
They are no more and such people who have their own projections

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.900
Of doing this and doing that and doing that trying every sort of thing

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.869
Just to have some new things

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:39.470
Spoil themselves completely within it was a very difficult task to begin with I

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.759
Had first only one lady and

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:48.739
After two years, I could give realization 212 people

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:54.590
In London, I had to work for sit for four years on seven

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.700
People for four years to give them realization

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:05.509
There's one thing about English they're hard nuts, but once they are there they are there

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.090
So

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:12.409
In the West I never thought I would ever work

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.590
because I was not sure that

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.380
I'll be able to do that

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:26.629
but unfortunately or fortunately my husband got addicted to this post four times that we anonymously

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.360
And that's how I am in England

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.280
Whatever it is

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.280
One has to realize that

00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:35.910
whatever

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:37.910
these prophets have said

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:46.129
These incarnations have said since long they have talked about the roots and not about the tree

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.720
But when

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:53.180
Such a thing starts

00:30:54.150 --> 00:31:01.489
Also, there are people who are seekers of Ages are born they are seekers they are serious seekers

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:07.489
There are many serious seekers in the West half are very very serious people

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:13.889
They have read so much about religion every religion. They are not conditioned people

00:31:14.919 --> 00:31:17.459
very sensible people and

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:23.219
They started coming to India and fell into traps of many cults and many people

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:30.809
From the year 1970 in a bigger hole than this had announced that you cannot charge any money

00:31:31.690 --> 00:31:33.960
for God's work you

00:31:34.929 --> 00:31:36.640
cannot live

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.380
on the earnings

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:40.380
of

00:31:41.559 --> 00:31:43.559
God's love

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:50.880
That time I took the name of the people who would go all around and try

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:56.639
To entice people and take money from them and live on that

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:05.699
Of course the surprisingly nobody has yet prosecuted that

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.400
Was the first beginning of sahaja yoga

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:19.530
that we started thinking in the terms of mass realisation, but

00:32:20.919 --> 00:32:22.979
I had to study quite a lot

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:29.760
because an Indian mind is very different from the Western mind and

00:32:30.610 --> 00:32:33.750
India knows that the aim of his life is self-realization

00:32:34.929 --> 00:32:38.249
Of course, we have learned so much from you about science

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.969
about economics about banking

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:44.910
insurances

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:51.720
But we have some knowledge about the roots and there is no harm in learning something

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:57.419
From India also in case we know it is worth something

00:32:59.230 --> 00:33:04.650
The knowledge of the Kundalini was known to Indians thousands of years back and

00:33:05.679 --> 00:33:06.940
also

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.860
there are

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:10.120
many

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.380
examples

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.559
of people getting realization

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:17.490
But they were very very few people

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:22.739
so when I started studying people I said there is a

00:33:23.409 --> 00:33:26.999
problem on the chakras on the centre's

00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:35.189
If you have to become a subtler being to enter into your roots, I have to see that your subtler

00:33:35.919 --> 00:33:41.879
Me is completely manifesting for that your chakras have to be clear

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.529
These chakras can be cleaned by various ways

00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.679
And we started using various methods

00:33:50.649 --> 00:33:54.989
to clean, of course all these methods

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:57.929
That we used to cleanse them

00:33:58.899 --> 00:34:00.250
where

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.959
according to the prescriptions we had from our

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:10.380
Other people like putting the hands like this comes from Mohammed Saheb

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.940
Because Mohammed Saheb has said at the time of resurrection your hands will speak

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.000
We do not deny any religion whatsoever

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:24.689
Because according to us all religions have truth hidden

00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:32.250
In a very subtle form and if you have that subtle understanding you can approach that

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:34.780
now

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.979
He has said at the time of resurrection your hands will speak

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:42.689
And is a fact your hands can speak no doubt

00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:47.700
But you have to get your realization. Otherwise, it doesn't work out

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.830
What we call is baptism is the same as realization

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:55.560
It is that

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.060
the

00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:59.950
Centers are cleared out

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:06.629
Then the Kundalini rises. That is the Holy Ghost rises and blesses you with your self-realization

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.800
And opens out your fontanel, bone area

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:17.609
Will be surprised in new zealand's a place like New Zealand the whole hall was all full

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:20.130
We didn't advertise much

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:23.460
but I don't know why people were so sensitive and

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:27.330
They came and they told me mother like a booze. It came out of her head

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.949
But I must say New Zealand people must be very deep people

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:37.560
There must be a very deep seeking in them and they are not affected by

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:39.520
other

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.520
conditionings

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.740
So surprising it was

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:47.340
Why in Melbourne also I had a very good experience. I

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:50.550
Would say that it is

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:54.959
The quality of the person that matters in sahaja yoga very much

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.600
Because it is the becoming

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:00.359
Like an egg becomes a bird

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.320
Like we can say a

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:10.590
Seed becomes a plant

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:18.300
now it is a becoming very important and so we have to see if a person is willing to

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.000
adapt that becoming

00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.719
We have our ways and methods of telling how to do

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.559
Nanak sabha said sahaja samadhi Lama

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:31.590
He said only through sahaja

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:37.100
By spontaneous happening by living process you get some other he said it

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:44.180
He said also that there are Ida and Pingala to noddy's within us

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:47.140
Kabirdasa has clearly said it

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:48.910
so

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:53.849
Into any cult when you go you will find they do not talk of any religion as such

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:59.789
They do not give you any ideas as to what the essence of the religion is

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:05.140
They do not prove it to you and they do not show you where it exists for

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:07.800
for example will say that

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:14.700
Christ is within us now. Where is Christ who was Christ how he came on this earth?

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:22.580
How he was conceived first in the heavens. What was the thing? He did? We don't know if he just read Bible

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.780
You won't know you have to read for that Devi mahatmya

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:30.120
you have to understand through that that Christ was the

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:33.280
Aumkara means what you call the

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:39.300
Divine sound he came out of that and that's why he could walk on the water

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:44.540
There are so many things written about Christ in other books and so many great things written

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.220
in those books that we do not want to

00:37:48.869 --> 00:37:53.098
going to them and how are we going to understand him, but first of all,

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:57.149
realization is very important to expand your

00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:59.440
attention

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.440
with an enlightened way I

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.540
Was happy to know that people in Adelaide are traditional

00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.240
All good traditions are to be accepted

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.920
They are not to be given up

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:18.149
There are family people. That's all also another good thing that they're family people

00:38:19.059 --> 00:38:20.079
but

00:38:20.079 --> 00:38:24.449
The problem is that they are placed into such a chaotic condition

00:38:24.999 --> 00:38:27.929
That they cannot decide what is right and what is wrong?

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:37.200
Now these traditions which are good should be taken and all these traditions we should build up something

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:44.490
That is wider and greater as soon as you get realization

00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.680
You get

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:51.700
Your

00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:57.689
New awareness called collective consciousness about which you has written very cleared

00:38:58.329 --> 00:39:03.298
You have to become collectively conscious but those who are superficial people

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.349
Don't get it

00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:09.748
Those people who have problems on this centre. Do not get it. They do not feel it

00:39:10.359 --> 00:39:16.348
Those people who are not serious minded don't get it if they don't get it then they start

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:25.109
Blaming others then blaming themselves. There are so many who have got realization and so many are doing well

00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:27.109
This is what is needed today

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:29.670
Unless and until you get to a transformation

00:39:30.099 --> 00:39:32.099
Unless and until you become your spirit

00:39:32.319 --> 00:39:37.199
Unless and until you get collective consciousness the problems of this world cannot be solved

00:39:39.279 --> 00:39:41.279
That's a fact but

00:39:41.859 --> 00:39:43.859
Everybody doesn't get it

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:46.170
everybody cannot get it and

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.390
We cannot guarantee that

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:52.980
Those who can get it have to be the people who should seriously

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:55.650
understand the importance of self-realization

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:58.470
For example in India. No problem

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:02.279
We have say the president of the world

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:09.500
high court, (unclear) , he got his realization just like this

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:13.109
In two minutes

00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:18.949
And he was so amazed at it. He asked his wife all the way. We knew them very well

00:40:18.949 --> 00:40:21.260
Otherwise also to fly out

00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.760
from  Udaipur

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:29.060
To see me and to get  her realization.  to them It is an important thing very important

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.060
The most important thing is to become the spirit

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.180
Because he is now the High Court judge

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:43.820
Hail high court, the highest position that you could reach it does not matter

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.900
It's nothing great

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:50.240
If he has not got his self-realization, what's the use of living in this world?

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.069
but the

00:40:53.069 --> 00:40:54.660
attention of

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:59.510
The people has to move that side and it has moved in the West quite a lot

00:40:59.510 --> 00:41:02.810
There are definitely lots of seekers in the West

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:08.780
But the problem of the West I must tell you is something very different

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:15.199
the problem of the West is like this that within us is there are two

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:18.290
systems which were autonomous nervous system

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.200
One is the left. Another is the right

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:27.360
The left one is called as the Ida Nadi or you call the moon

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:31.820
Channel or the one which is which looks after

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.839
I've been lecturing every night for hours

00:41:42.610 --> 00:41:44.610
The moon Channel

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:48.660
now the moon channel is the one that

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:55.890
works out our desires we get our desires through this left-side moon channel and

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.830
the right-side one if you see clearly

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.240
It starts little

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:06.360
from the second center is the one we call it as I

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:14.009
Mean no use telling English in English. There is no English name. So it is called as Pingala

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:18.059
Now this is the channel that works out our action

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:25.049
First one gives us desire and the second one gives us action

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:30.329
Now a person who goes to extreme on any one of them

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:40.120
Tries to go away from the center. For example. Now we have in the West lots of ideas say about

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.640
Action

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:46.349
Now this is the right side. This is the left side. Now, we have the right and left and the center in between

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:52.820
Alright now if you are too much in the action on the right side going to imbalance it breaks

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:01.800
The connection with the main if it breaks the connection with the main then what happens you start working on your own this side

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:08.200
The connection the control goes away. Once the control of the central nervous system is gone

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:13.680
You can become malignant. You can develop any diseases of that kind which are psychosomatic

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:20.969
Also with the physical exertions and all that you can develop some other diseases which are more physical

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:24.300
now going to extremes for example for

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:29.279
Ladies I have always told who are married ladies

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:33.780
I have already stole about them that they really work very hard in the West in the sense

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:40.079
They have their standards are so high. Everything should be spic-and-span and all the time a cleaning. They have no time to rest

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:44.759
They have no time to rest at all. They must take out some time to rest and

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:47.489
Look after themselves as well

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:52.260
They should involve the whole family in the work and see that there is a little balance

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:57.719
It should not be that the only the woman should go on working all the time for the house

00:43:58.060 --> 00:44:05.580
Of course homemaking is her love and her liking but that doesn't mean that she should completely sort of

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:08.620
get

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:13.440
Ruined with that she has to use a balance. She should use

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:18.860
Some balances which are useful to keep her up her

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:27.000
Self in the center. So what we say that everything should be done in a moderate form, please please madam

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:34.040
It's you please please well. Everything should be you are not the only person listening. There are many see. Listen. I'll tell you madam

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:35.340
See now one thing

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:36.070
I must tell you

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:40.860
There are so many who have come here all the way and I have come all the way from London. All right

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:47.000
Understand that you are not the only person who has come to listen, but why do you don't you allow others to listen?

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:53.600
This is uncivil. You are not civil. You should allow others to listen. They have come to listen to me not to you

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.240
Keep quiet I listen to you later on. All right

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:00.130
There should be

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:03.140
Sensible thing this is no sense. What's the use?

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.280
If I am

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:11.400
but I mean whatever your ideas are groping inside you keep to yourself. Why do you want to force it on me?

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.900
All right, let me make . then you hold a meeting and make it

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.620
Can you get even one person to listen to you madam? I

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.440
Would like to know no, no, no, please just

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:29.700
See they have not come to listen to you at all. They have come to listen to me

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:34.380
All right. None of them are here to listen to you. It's a simple thing like that

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:41.039
Why are you talking if you want to talk? Let us you can have a meeting of a bigger quality talk to them?

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.440
Tell them whatever you want to tell it's alright

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:46.290
And I won't disturb you

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:53.400
And let me tell them alright now keep it to yourself nobody has come -

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:55.240
alright

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:56.590
now

00:45:56.590 --> 00:46:00.900
This is the I was telling you about the extreme go

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:03.840
behavior of anything is not

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:06.840
We have to keep in balance

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:09.300
When we come in the balance

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:16.889
In the moderate way, if we live then what happens that we keep this contact all the time with the whole

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:22.020
Now the Kundalini that is down below in three-and-a-half

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:25.860
Coils has to rise through all this

00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:30.120
When she Rises through all this she pierces through your fontanel

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:35.220
Bone area and you actually feel the cool breeze coming out of your head

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:40.829
If you do not feel it and if you say I am feeling it you are a hypocrite. I

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:44.759
Am NOT going to say you are feeling it it is you worse to say

00:46:45.579 --> 00:46:51.149
There are many people who come to sahaja yoga like that. I'm feeling it. It's about is that unnecessarily?

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.520
Why should they try to deceive themselves?

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:59.460
You are not to deceive yourself. You see yourself that you feel the cool breeze coming out of here

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:09.260
Are you genie are you genie, huh? What's it I can't hear you. Sorry

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.000
I can't hear you madam. I'm sorry

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:22.460
No, I'm not I can't hear

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:28.280
No, I am NOT. I am NOT. You shouldn't say like that. No, I am NOT a liar

00:47:28.289 --> 00:47:30.778
I'm not hearing you at all and I'll give you a chance to talk

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:37.080
All right, despite everything I will give you a chance to talk. There's a letter against you here. Are you Jeanie?

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.080
Are you Jeannie?

00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:43.520
Jenny you thinned down very much. I must say

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.880
You are much fatter person were you

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:54.540
Yes, I know now there's a letter about you here, which I don’t want to read it out.

00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:57.180
It's not good, but you better read it yourself

00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:05.579
No, no. No, I I'm not like you, I am not like you. Alright now keep the dignity of the whole thing. No sense

00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:10.049
Be sensible. There's nothing it is so

00:48:11.259 --> 00:48:13.259
But it's not the time

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.440
they have not come here for me -

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:24.860
Yes,  Just see, why should we take their time they have not come here to listen

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:31.440
When I did no I didn't even knew you much

00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:38.100
See this is you are she herself? We see now. This lady says that she was driven out

00:48:38.799 --> 00:48:44.488
Means she was taking on she herself never went away. Why did she go away? She didn't like it

00:48:45.849 --> 00:48:49.379
That's a simple thing. She should have gone away. Why was she is taking on?

00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.600
What did she say oh

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:09.140
Oh. I see. There is a letter about that, your brainwashing. Nirmala, you know Nirmala? Now, read it out now. Better have it.

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:18.640
Alright let it be what she has to say about you if you can say something she can also say something. All right

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:23.419
She also has a right to say no little bit let it out

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:27.049
Stephens do you mind reading it out once for all?

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:31.040
Listen to this what she has to say about you

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:36.770
She sent a telegram

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:52.109
Take this. That’s wasting of time. It’s Adelaide speciality

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:56.540
We should I don't know what's the matter

00:49:57.060 --> 00:49:59.820
But last time we have gone again, they came to hit me.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.240
Before that, there was some other. All the time you have a group like that All the time

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:08.700
and I am surprised. You see if some people can’t do Sahaj yoga, alright give it up.

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.640
Why should they be thrown out?

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:20.849
That's all and you can go to the courts you see not here why doesn't she go to the courts to see that sensible

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:31.919
Why is she so angry and now listen now another another angry person you listen to her what she has done to her

00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:44.160
Just waste of time

00:50:45.339 --> 00:50:47.339
All right, but this is not the place

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:52.079
My child, this is not see if she's hurt. She would have written to me

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:56.490
She would have come and see me. She would have talked to me. This is don't rest there

00:50:56.490 --> 00:51:01.260
You see you. See nobody has come to listen to her if somebody's hurt. This is civil

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:05.699
You tell me others have come here to listen to me. All right?

00:51:06.579 --> 00:51:10.619
But why do you expose here why to demonstrate here? She can come and see me tomorrow

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:14.250
I will give her time 1 hour 2 hour, whatever she wants

00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:18.959
All right, but why disturb everyone they have come for their realization let them have

00:51:20.049 --> 00:51:22.049
Why do want to be dog in the manger?

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:26.900
But it is justifiable

00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:51.040
All right, all right, just listen to this letter now you have one complaint

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:55.900
She has another complaint about you this she told me on the phone that it is about you really has written

00:51:55.900 --> 00:52:00.060
But this is what she has sent now. There's a complaint about her you see in any group

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:07.700
There can be complaints about people we have driven out so many men also from Sahaja Yoga so many but you see

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.180
Driven out we had to ask them to get out

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:16.210
They never went out if she had gone out then I would have understood her that she had grudges

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:22.390
But when she was asked to get out then she has grudges means that we should have grudge about her. I

00:52:25.310 --> 00:52:27.310
Can't just hear I don't know what's happened

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:33.370
All right. Let me let them Jenny. There's no need to be that aggressive. There's no need

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.920
All right, no need come along

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:00.200
You were in Sahaja Yoga ?

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:07.560
I tell you this Adelaide business

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:28.680
You are not allowing me to speak at all, but this is not the way if one person is hurt

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.300
This is not the way

00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:37.330
Now if she's hurt she could have come and told me she would have which is welcome for that

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:41.230
She would have told me this is what has happened anything you see there are ways

00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:45.250
It is quite simple my child

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:51.420
She looks quite alright, you don't know what she has done if you read the letter. Why don't you read the letter?

00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:25.000
What is it? Bevakoofon ki kami nahin hai Galib.(meaning ‘there is no dearth of fools’ as said by Galib the great poet)

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:32.220
What is this

00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:45.750
We

00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:59.829
Yes, this is not proper it's not being kind to your people in Adelaide

00:55:00.590 --> 00:55:07.720
This is dog is the manga this is no no no, no. No. No Jenny. That's not problem. No, no, he's not proper

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:11.859
This is not proper. There's no propriety. I must say there's no propriety

00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:15.940
This is not the way to behave you could come and see me. I am here only for one day

00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:20.290
There are so many people wanted to hear me now your jump you want me to hear you?

00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:25.389
It's selfish is it you should of course, you're very selfish. You should come and see me

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:27.410
I told you you can come and see I

00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:32.280
Can talk to you I can talk to all of them and tell them whatever is wrong. We try to correct it

00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:37.860
That's a simple way But this is being very selfish. Just to correct it, attract the attention of everyone.

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.960
If you call a meeting, will you have these people? There's no

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:50.200
All right, six years is finished eight years is finished I have been working for 16 years, and I've had people like this

00:55:50.420 --> 00:55:52.780
So what am I to do? I bet huh?

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.360
how much what?

00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:04.440
I have paid from my own bank quite a lot, for your information. You know for definite. That’s there. You should not lie.

00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:12.440
That is Janie now you don’t lie there. You know I have paid out of my pockets. You know that very very well.

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.100
Now don't tell lies there

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:18.010
You know that you can't say this this

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:21.190
What jewelry?

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:27.600
With jewelry, nothing I all you see actually will be surprised

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:34.040
What jewellery? What jewellery? No jewellery? What jewellery you gave me?

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:38.520
What did she give me

00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:44.149
You know, I mean just imagine see now I

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:49.700
I'll tell you one thing. She's she's really she's really talking through her hat

00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:59.600
If you ask my husband

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:21.160
These feminist are. What are you doing? Why are you, why are you behaving like this? You see, this is not proper. It’s not being proper.

00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:26.080
No. No. Jenny. It’s not proper. You are making allegations which are absolutely false.

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:33.520
You know that. You know that I have spent lots of money out of my pockets. And I have been giving lots of presents

00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:41.000
Myself and not a single thing that you have given me I've used it. No, no, no, no, no, no no, no, no

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000
No, it's not correct

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.120
What see why do you what

00:57:58.740 --> 00:58:06.100
No. No. No. I’ll tell you about. I’ll tell you about. Is she here? Melissa is she here? Is Paul here? Is he here? Is he here? Call him?

00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:08.700
I'll tell him he will know why why what happened? He let him be here while topic

00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:14.640
Why are you talking? No. You don’t talk for him. Why didn't he come? Why didn't he come? No, I know

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:22.240
I know everything I know everything that happens everything. All right, sit down sit down. Why not?

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:31.860
All right, now this one is a story see we had thousand people in that place throughout I

00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:39.449
Didn't take I never touch money, you know that very well. No, no, I who

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:42.860
Whose brother?

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:50.680
Who? Who gave me? Who? Who is this brother?

00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:57.240
Ten thousand dollars.

00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:01.420
I have absolutely no knowledge. Is an absolute lie. This is a lie.

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.840
I can put you on the court on this no nothing of the kind

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:05.880
Nothing of the kind

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:10.400
If he had given me I would have known and if he had put that money I give it for Sahaj Yoga work

00:59:10.409 --> 00:59:14.480
But I do not need your money. You must know that I am sufficiently

00:59:15.370 --> 00:59:20.579
Enough with myself and I give away my money. You know that very well Jenny and don't tell lies

00:59:23.530 --> 00:59:27.989
Well, I don't know I don't know where is it you find out I am first time I am hearing

00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:31.080
See, I'll tell you first time

00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:38.000
I am hearing this from you that the person who died because I had cured him of AIDS. You know that and then he died.

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:42.360
Is he the one? No. Which one? Which one is William? Which one is this William?

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:47.660
Which one is this William from Adelaide? When where who is this William?

00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:58.340
Oh

00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.170
Oh

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:04.760
I never say that we never used those words. I never use I

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:08.380
Did I say to you all

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:16.440
All lies. I mean A to Z is a lie.

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:21.940
See now

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:28.960
there are there are so many people in our movement and if somebody says that if I find it if I know it I

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:33.560
I verify it and I throw him out. And she did the same, that’s why she was thrown out.

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:40.000
Why not read the letter, why we threw her out. Just read the letter, why we threw her out.

01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:57.900
This is the way why do you want to get insulted?

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:06.080
Why do you want to get insulted for nothing at all is all a lie. I must say it's all a lie. I

01:01:07.350 --> 01:01:09.350
Don't need

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.380
Let them go it is not correct. It's absolutely a lie

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:27.700
What’s the name of the gentleman who gave the money? Just ask her also. What’s the name of the gentleman? You should find out.

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:31.180
Hello. Mrs. Jenny, please tell us who is the gentleman

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:38.600
No. No. We want to know. Hello. I want to know the name of the gentleman who left the money. Will you please tell?

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:42.760
Please tell me I want to find out I will find out huh?

01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:47.390
Who was he and

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.190
Now who is the gentleman give us the address?

01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:54.500
I must find out and if it is not so, I’ll sue you. I will sue you.. Alright. Bring it.

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:57.080
Where is the thing? Where is the ten thousand?

01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:00.700
Alright, let’s find out.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:06.180
No, no to be exact. Let us know who is the gentleman

01:02:07.020 --> 01:02:09.020
nobody gave

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.040
just imagine

01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:22.900
These are lies I tell you

01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:31.280
Even this time, coming to Australia, I have purchased my own ticket.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:35.260
Now this lady they should tell me the name of the man who gave money

01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:37.780
supposing

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:42.140
You better get her removed. You better go. You are very troublesome.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:50.300
You see they are the people who form sort of unions. And they did the same in the Ashrams.

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.760
That's not allowed in Sahaja Yoga

01:02:53.360 --> 01:03:00.680
You are not supposed to form any unions like that. And these were saying, we are feminist and we must dominate men.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.700
then

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:04.700
Shit. That’s letter

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.040
What words , imagine

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.500
You can't abuse me

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:25.500
Please, will you ask this lady and this one also to go?

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.600
No. No. This one. This one with

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:33.360
orange dress. Ask her to go. Please. You see, I don’t want to insult you, Madam

01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:37.980
But this is wrong to insult me like this. You can't say all these words to me for nothing at all

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:44.060
I have done no wrong to anyone. I have always tried to help everyone spending. My husband's money is a fact you know that

01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:48.060
Beg your Pardon

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.520
What's he saying

01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:54.820
What is he saying?

01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:02.899
Quite a lot. I must say quite a lot you see now he has paid for my coming here

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.979
Alright, but sometimes they also feel ashamed that I should pay for their salvation

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.550
So they tried to pay to the travelers

01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:16.399
Not to me. I don't need any money. Thank God, you know if Christ was living

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.400
I don't know what you would have done to him

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:22.459
By God's grace I come from a rich family and my husband is quite well-off

01:04:23.010 --> 01:04:26.659
Otherwise you would have finished off Christ who was just a carpenter's son

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:31.100
After all if I have to travel it's better that you pay for your salvation

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:34.100
but still that is also paid by my husband and

01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:40.189
Sometimes he jokes also that all the Guru's are making big money and here is one guru who is giving her own money to others?

01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:45.469
You see this is a not affect, but somebody supposing give something to me

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:50.329
Say precious the other day one lady gave me a diamond. I don't take it

01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:56.299
I said sell it and whatever is the money all this money should be donated for the work of sahaja yoga

01:04:56.630 --> 01:05:00.439
Now the work of sahaja yoga is that we have to buy ashrams

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:04.550
For people to live. We have got a very nice school in Melbourne

01:05:05.070 --> 01:05:07.729
Actually in Adelaide we have done nothing here

01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:10.969
The people have been not so constructive but in Melbourne

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:18.620
we have got a beautiful school where the government has certified that the school is so beautiful and the children are

01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:21.170
What they are claiming

01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:29.179
So beautiful and such a private school is doesn't exist in Australia. That's how they have certified the school

01:05:29.310 --> 01:05:33.019
It's a primary school run by sahaja. Yogi's the sahaja

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:35.719
Yogi's also have to sacrifice a little bit because you know

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:39.500
the private school fees is quite a lot and everybody cannot afford to pay and

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:44.300
They were amazed at the children that there now if you want to make false

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:48.620
Allegations what can anybody do but I can prove it that this my money

01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:55.300
She's saying somebody I took ten thousand you see it is very difficult to give me anything very difficult You try

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.520
Even my husband finds it difficult to give me anything

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.410
That's not my nature to take

01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:02.340
All right

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:05.840
You see this is the main thing a person who takes money will not

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:10.399
Shout at the top of her voice all the time that you cannot pay for work Oh

01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:12.210
isn't

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:14.750
this is the first time we have people here like this and

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.459
This lady I must tell you has the problem in a very funny problem

01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:23.359
Which I don't want to talk to you and because of that problem we had to ask her to go

01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:30.230
Come here I tell you I come here. I'll tell you if you come here. I'll tell you

01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:39.379
Why do you want to know her problem, I'll tell her not you who are you to ask me I am NOT going to tell

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:43.600
Let her come and see me. I'll tell her I am NOT going to tell

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.740
Otherwise, why did we throw?

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:56.480
Now there's one person I'll tell you as he said it this gentleman has said it correctly that there may be somebody who did it

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:59.720
You see there was one person. I don't know if he did the same

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:06.500
He was the same here, but somebody who was who was a man who was not a woman and very very dominating

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:10.699
We threw him out. He is in Australia which threw out three men and

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:16.339
Few women we had to because we are not supposed to dominate you see in a place

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:19.490
Where we have to think of God and of peace

01:07:20.300 --> 01:07:25.480
We cannot have people who believe in dominate. We cannot have people who try to

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:27.540
Assert on anyone

01:07:27.540 --> 01:07:32.640
Now the question of her husband being sick. You see this Melissa

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:36.400
They haven't come both of them haven't come because I know the mistake was this

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:43.360
They I had told them not to sit in the sun too much and not to drink too much of orange juice

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:49.640
But the orange juice is such an attractive thing say I did think they could not control and he developed this diarrhea

01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:57.540
We have three doctors always on the two always we have three doctors on the two who look after them. They are they're free

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.180
They look after them now

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:02.359
We were in a very far off village when this fellow got this

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:06.060
Still he was brought they said we'll take her to the hospital. She wouldn't agree

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.430
She wouldn't agree

01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:15.340
She is such a neglecting wife such a neglecting wife that Indian women were surprised. How could she she neglect her husband like this?

01:08:15.350 --> 01:08:20.300
It's all right, he'll be all right, she was postponing and it was our doctors who took him there

01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:27.649
I mean the day they were admitted because of us because in India a foreigner cannot be admitted unless until you have a doctor certificate

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:33.540
No in India, they are very particular about foreigners admitted and that's how they admitted

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.980
Now there's another thing I'll tell you how the bonafide is can be established of Sahaja Yoga

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:46.140
Sahaja yoga also in India very much respected. Any foreigner who goes to India has to have a clean chit from a doctor

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.800
except for Sahaja Yogi's

01:08:49.199 --> 01:08:56.118
In Delhi, I say this is the trouble in Bombay in Delhi. We are doing so much but here it's so difficult

01:08:56.759 --> 01:08:59.988
and also I say Rome is very good, Austria is good

01:09:00.599 --> 01:09:03.679
And Australia poetry is very good for partly quite funny

01:09:04.199 --> 01:09:07.578
Now I tell you one thing in Delhi. They are having a

01:09:08.969 --> 01:09:10.969
proper investigation made

01:09:11.849 --> 01:09:14.209
for cancer for liver and

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.319
For asthma how Sahaja Yoga can cure

01:09:19.139 --> 01:09:26.359
They have already made the Dean of Faculty of physiology can write to him. Mr. Rai of Delhi University has

01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:33.379
Already submitted a paper about sahaja yoga saying that sahaja yogi has a much better resistance than other people

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:36.119
Has proved it

01:09:36.119 --> 01:09:39.109
And it is being accepted and published by

01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:44.900
The government you can write to him and find out you see this is the trouble here

01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:48.280
Here no officers come. Such people come in who are good for nothing.

01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:53.980
They trouble us do they is true that all kinds of things such problems you get fed up with them

01:09:53.989 --> 01:10:00.589
You see you are here to get your realization to get well to be alright to be good to healthy people to enjoy

01:10:00.809 --> 01:10:04.309
Yourself to have a good married life and to have sweet children

01:10:04.309 --> 01:10:07.909
That's why we are in sahaja yoga not to fight and claim things

01:10:07.909 --> 01:10:11.560
I mean, this is a falsehood complete falsehood that somebody gave me ten thousand rupees

01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:17.840
Say for complete falsehood. Why didn't she tell me the name and address of the person? it's impossible?

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.840
I cannot take a single - why should I?

01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:22.820
What is the need for me to do?

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.820
If you get Melissa’s husband Paul, he’ll tell you.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:33.760
He knows he never came here. Why didn't he come the one who was sick?

01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:43.260
He never came Melissa never came, these people are just putting up something some people are never in the Sahaja

01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:44.960
Yoga only this lady was

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.300
And she was troublesome. She gave us trouble

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:52.140
And we are, are we not free to ask somebody to go out of Sahaja Yoga, if she gives us trouble

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.360
still we should stick on to them and

01:10:57.100 --> 01:10:59.780
Jewelry and other what jewelry you can give I have so much jewelry

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:06.040
You see sometimes these people give me some sort of a jewelry, which is optional sometimes and given money to Sahaja Yoga

01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:09.720
I don't take anything. Why should I take I have so much already. I don't know what to do with it

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:14.060
Actually, I am giving away all most of my jewelry silver to these people

01:11:14.780 --> 01:11:16.780
all nonsense

01:11:21.139 --> 01:11:23.139
So

01:11:23.449 --> 01:11:25.449
My brother is here

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:31.750
Who is the judge of High Court Bombay High Court is sitting here and watching you people

01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:40.870
Is this the way to behave

01:11:41.449 --> 01:11:43.219
very childish

01:11:43.219 --> 01:11:47.589
Very childish despite that you get your realization. I

01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:54.999
Must say you people must be great in your last lines how many mistakes people have committed here?

01:11:55.070 --> 01:12:00.549
How much we have tried to sort of harm ourselves, but you get your realization

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:07.719
That's the beauty of the whole thing. There must be something about you that you get your realization

01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:15.609
But those who don't get start fighting now, how can we give it there's no force

01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:22.390
We cannot say all right now supposing this one seed which doesn't sprout say. All right, then she says no, why must stop?

01:12:22.390 --> 01:12:24.390
Why don't I sprout?

01:12:24.469 --> 01:12:27.099
Can you do that? It's a living process, isn't it?

01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:31.100
And we don't tell

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:34.840
Problems of one person to another there are problems serious problems

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:40.100
Very very serious problems. People have we don’t tell because it’s not proper.

01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:46.220
We know because we know their centres and that's how we know what problems they're I

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:53.500
Mean we are definitely cured people no doubt about it, and you all can be cured and you can enjoy your health

01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:58.460
We have with us one psychiatrist here, who is first class first who is a first class first of

01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:06.100
of Cambridge and first class first, We have a psychiatrist. You see these are very mediocre people.

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:10.240
We have people here who are very highly qualified

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.640
Who are travelling with me?

01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:17.830
Absolutely mediocre people nothing to do living on doles and behaving like this

01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:23.199
This dole business should vanish from this country. I tell you half of your problems will be solved

01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:26.169
Let them get to some work let them know their value

01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:33.790
That's the problem because of this dole business. You see this no self-respect. They don't understand that they must get their self-realization

01:13:37.909 --> 01:13:39.909
It is very surprising

01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:45.940
That all the television and all that came here just to follow the people to shout out and then they are not

01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:48.909
Interested. Is this the way to encourage these people?

01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:55.680
Nothing good about them. What is so special what good has she done what is her importance?

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:03.100
She's still talking now, please stop madam

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:20.100
What’s she saying? What’s she saying?

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:35.540
What to do? you are not in balance. I have to stoop down to your level

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:45.640
See this is this is the same person who tried I am quite in balance

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.819
But I have to stoop down to your levels to pull you out. I am quite in balance. All right

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:57.780
Now listen don't tell me stories will you please stop that?

01:15:04.540 --> 01:15:08.900
You are not interested. no you are not you are not the one

01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:22.040
I would like to say that Shri Mataji had given me so much in my life. So much peace and happiness.

01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:24.720
But I would just like you all to ask these

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:29.420
Four these two people here those two people there and maybe these two if you can't keep quiet

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:30.300
I don't know

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:36.560
But could you please just go now and let’s have the meeting, to give other people a chance to get what I had.

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.480
Oh

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:56.560
no. Will you please ask her to go now? Will you please? Now, this is a. Will you please? Can you please ask the?

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:05.860
So much time she has taken I can't help it I was just in time for you

01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:15.360
Stephens leave us a policeman to take her out. She's talking too much.I mean, she doesn’t understand anything.

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:24.520
All right, so those who are interested in Sahaja Yoga should stay the rest can go away

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.790
You see it doesn't matter how many people get it?

01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:32.439
The thing is as I have told you only those who deserve it will get it

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:39.339
Everybody doesn't get it doesn't matter whatever has happened. I'm sure you all will get your realization. I'm sure of it

01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:44.139
It doesn't matter because it's the quality that matters. This is the quality

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:51.300
There are people who are anxious to get realization

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:15.960
Don't hurt her.  don't hurt her

01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:33.420
What a relief

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:39.780
Alright, but don't hurt her just let it be.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:47.880
Only thing you can't crucify me

01:17:52.730 --> 01:17:57.490
All right, it does matter take it easy that's life

01:18:17.679 --> 01:18:24.719
Now as I was telling you now if you go to any extremes you break your connection with the whole

01:18:25.239 --> 01:18:29.729
And as you break your connection with the whole all these centers which are supplying

01:18:30.579 --> 01:18:32.579
horizontally to our

01:18:32.679 --> 01:18:37.109
physical mental emotional and spiritual being get cut or get

01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:41.250
Exhausted or augmented as they call it in medical terminology

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:48.239
So the central part is the parasympathetic nervous system, which doctors have not reached?

01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:54.440
Now through this Kundalini, which is there, which is three and a half point many try this

01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:57.260
It pierces through six centers

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:03.980
pierces through your fontanel bone area and when it pierces through your fontanel area you get your

01:19:05.290 --> 01:19:07.709
self-realization as simple as that

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:11.120
this

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:18.660
This is your mother Individual mother, because she gives you birth a

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:22.980
Second birth, and she doesn't trouble you

01:19:23.619 --> 01:19:25.409
She doesn't give you any problems

01:19:25.409 --> 01:19:32.578
She takes up all problems upon herself she tries but I have seen in some people the Kundalini is very badly hurt

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.090
wounded

01:19:34.090 --> 01:19:35.260
just

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:37.409
All the time like a bleeding

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:44.460
Serpent you can say it's just moving up and down helplessly trying to rise

01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:47.399
It rises and falls down in some people

01:19:47.980 --> 01:19:51.419
And it is such a sad thing that it works out in

01:19:52.719 --> 01:19:54.250
days together

01:19:54.250 --> 01:19:57.750
When the person cooperates to keep the Kundalini up there

01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:04.920
But most of the people get it and with little practice about a year or so at the most they become masters

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:11.680
But within one month they know everything about Sahaja Yoga and they know how to do in fact you become your own master

01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:17.900
You don't have to have any guru. You don't have to have any master. for this You don't have to pay a single pie

01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:20.540
You don't have to do anything of the kind

01:20:20.849 --> 01:20:27.899
It just works out automatically and you can give realizations to others once you get it when you become the master

01:20:28.210 --> 01:20:31.049
But that is a quality which one has to achieve

01:20:31.810 --> 01:20:34.859
If you achieve that quality then only you can do it

01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:41.099
Otherwise, you cannot do it by talking about spirit by talking about God you do not achieve it

01:20:41.410 --> 01:20:46.079
It is a living process of evolution as we have become human beings

01:20:46.090 --> 01:20:51.210
We become that higher being this is the seeking today and that's what people are seeking

01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:55.499
They are not seeking something which has been said or done

01:20:55.500 --> 01:21:03.140
But they want that beyond this one and beyond this is the spirit. But as I told you the people who are

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.560
Not of that quality do not get it

01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:14.480
But for that you cannot blame anyone you cannot blame yourself and you should not feel guilty about it either

01:21:15.190 --> 01:21:19.440
But you must know that everybody if he tries can achieve it

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:25.589
Some people might get it today. Some people might get tomorrow doesn't matter if you work it out

01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:30.479
It is very easy to get your self-realization in modern times

01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:34.229
Now as in our country we had searched

01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:37.260
in the

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:39.960
Subtler side of our life towards the roots

01:21:40.630 --> 01:21:42.630
We have definitely

01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:46.700
Found out so many things so many points so many Saints have written

01:21:47.220 --> 01:21:50.760
Say in the sixteenth century. There was a great poet called ToKurama

01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:56.860
He has described it very clearly and then there in the sixth century. We had Adi Shankaracharya who has described it

01:21:56.880 --> 01:22:00.690
but later on I would say it was Guru Nanaka and

01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:04.470
Kabira who has described Kundalini in their scriptures

01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:09.240
The main point is that in India. Also people got diverted

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:15.380
They were told that we should not read this the sixth chapter of the Ganesha Rock

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:19.900
Because it talked about Kundalini because they did not want to do it

01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:26.760
They did not know it. They had no authority like a priest class. They were in the same way in every religion, I think

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:33.899
Nobody tried to find out how to get self-realization that was the problem and because of that people have suffered

01:22:34.630 --> 01:22:39.930
there have been many great people who have been self-realized even we can say like

01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:44.300
Michelangelo was a realized soul. Now if I say that

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:47.220
How can you say Mother you can ask me a question?

01:22:47.220 --> 01:22:47.820
Mother

01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:52.259
how can I say that Michelangelo was or Mozart was he was because

01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:57.629
When you put your attention to him and put hands like this you start getting cool vibrations in your hands

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:02.249
That's how you can find out who was a realized soul who was not a realized

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:08.840
So the truth, you know through your hands not through your rationality through your understanding, but you know

01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:12.660
What is right and what is wrong through your hands now?

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:17.280
These are five centers as shown there clearly you can see on the hands

01:23:17.410 --> 01:23:22.139
Yeah, find is not shown I think in this one. All right, these are this is these are the five centers

01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:27.629
It's just six and this is the seventh this is on the left hand side is the emotional side and right hand side

01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:29.780
the physical and the

01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:36.520
intelligence, so these one two, three four five six and seven

01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:41.680
These are the seventh Center now somebody has a problem on any Center

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:45.990
you start feeling either a numbness or

01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:48.810
a coolness or

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.980
a kind of a burning

01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:54.240
Sometimes even a little blisters come out of the thing.

01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:57.620
Then you should know that person has a problem of the center

01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:00.479
now if you know the decoding of this finger

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:06.660
What does it mean and how this is caused you can correct it if you can correct it that person feels

01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:07.890
All right, you feel all right

01:24:07.890 --> 01:24:13.619
And you have all the powers to cure that person here or yourself and we want with the divine force

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:18.239
It is the all-pervading power of God everywhere this call it

01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:22.919
But we have never felt it. We have never felt the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:27.180
Now this is the first time we feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:31.709
first time we feel we become sensitive to it and we start feeling

01:24:32.170 --> 01:24:34.000
but those people who are

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:40.020
Conditioned who are running after other thing who are members of these and members of that and members all their lives

01:24:40.020 --> 01:24:42.020
They finish as members of this and members of that

01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:45.179
They do not get anything out of it, and they do not know

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:49.260
What is their meaning first time we discover your meaning when you become the spirit?

01:24:50.260 --> 01:24:52.409
Unless and until you become the spirit

01:24:52.410 --> 01:24:58.649
you will not know your meaning as I told today today radio lady that it's like a

01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:01.720
an instrument

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:03.720
Unless and until it is connected to the mains

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:09.629
It is useless in the same way unless and until we are connected to the mains. We are know

01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:12.389
We are not happy. We are not satisfied

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:15.260
now this

01:25:15.420 --> 01:25:18.820
(in Hindi) ‘trikonakar asthi’ what we call as The Sacrum Bone

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:23.600
Has that power which is the pure desire within us

01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:26.140
the pure desire

01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:31.079
The pure desire is only one the rest of the desires are impure

01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:34.859
the pure desire is to rise and

01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:38.730
Get to the divine power

01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:40.530
Once you get that

01:25:40.530 --> 01:25:48.450
It's like a light coming into a lamp then what is the lamp do is to give realization to us it?

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:52.780
Starts giving lots of realization to others and starts

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:59.560
Giving all the ...they are only interested in the quarrel.

01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.320
They would not come it's such an important thing

01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:16.410
Such an important thing, but they are only interested in the quarrel if somebody they're going to quarrel they'll all line up with stuff

01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:21.270
It's not a very good thing, you know, this must understand the importance of the time

01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:24.810
is the most important time this is the

01:26:25.390 --> 01:26:29.939
Judgement time here. You are going to get the power to judge yourself and judge others

01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:34.200
And if you do not develop that within you you are lost

01:26:34.900 --> 01:26:38.670
So it is important for all of you to feel your spirit

01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:42.779
Now I can go on talking like this for a long time

01:26:43.300 --> 01:26:47.430
But I would like you to get your realization and by God's grace

01:26:47.430 --> 01:26:48.790
I am sure it will work out

01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:54.569
Now those who want to have their realisation should stay those who do not want please go away

01:26:55.060 --> 01:27:01.560
You cannot force on anyone you have to ask for it. I cannot force on anyone. You see something one should understand

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:03.560
It's a living process

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.880
You become absolutely normal

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.320
first of all

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:14.970
Normalcy means that you do not feel guilty about anything

01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:19.680
You be pleasant to yourself. You should be pleasantly placed towards yourself

01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:27.810
You should be in a happy mood and should not think that you have done this mistake that mistake and committed this crime that crime

01:27:29.290 --> 01:27:34.859
It is you who is going to judge yourself? It's not me. It's you who is going to judge

01:27:35.590 --> 01:27:40.290
Afterwards when you have got realization, it's like this if supposing I have a snake in my hand

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:43.920
all right, and somebody tells me there's a snake in your hand and

01:27:44.460 --> 01:27:51.920
There's darkness in my ego. I might say no I don't believe I'm going to hold on to it, but then somebody says

01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:58.620
That put on the light and the lights are on you see the snake you just drop it

01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:01.750
It's like that

01:28:01.750 --> 01:28:02.860
so

01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:10.470
The knowledge is the truth and truth is the knowledge and everything is the love of God and compassion

01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:13.859
There is no place for hatred and anger

01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:16.620
in Sahaja Yoga

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.600
Now I think we have had too much of

01:28:21.850 --> 01:28:27.059
Question-and-answer he let us have our realization. Some people can come forward would be better idea

01:28:27.210 --> 01:28:29.730
You can move forward if some people want to come forward

01:28:45.250 --> 01:28:47.250
No, no, yeah, yeah

01:28:57.230 --> 01:29:02.049
Now the peaceful with yourself first of all forgive yourself forgive yourself

01:29:03.079 --> 01:29:05.079
that's very important and

01:29:05.329 --> 01:29:08.529
be confident that you are all capable of

01:29:09.199 --> 01:29:11.199
Getting realization

01:29:12.289 --> 01:29:14.949
Do not blame yourself for anything

01:29:16.099 --> 01:29:18.788
Whatever you have done is forgiven

01:29:19.699 --> 01:29:26.979
Absolutely, so do not blame yourself. You have to have a complete faith in yourself. That's very important

01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:31.080
All right

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:42.920
No

01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:02.520
As I said the left hand is a desire so you please put your left hand on your lap

01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:03.640
It would be nice

01:30:03.640 --> 01:30:07.320
if you can take out our shoes also to get the help from the Mother earth because

01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:10.580
She sucks in most of our problems very easily

01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:22.300
It takes only five to seven minutes but only thing is one should intensely ask for it and wanted

01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:25.900
Please put your left hand towards me

01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:42.690
Now with the right hand we do the action now, I'll tell you how you will have to raise your own Kundalini

01:30:42.730 --> 01:30:49.410
All right, you will know how to raise your own Kundalini and that's how you can practice at home also

01:30:50.140 --> 01:30:54.449
Now this left hand is towards me. That is that you want your realization?

01:30:55.360 --> 01:31:00.449
Now right hand is first put on the heart where resides the spirit

01:31:06.010 --> 01:31:11.370
Now this right hand is taken down again on the center here

01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:16.589
which is the center as we call it the swadhishthana, which is the center which does all the

01:31:17.949 --> 01:31:25.919
I'm sorry. This is on the upper part of it. There is the center of the principle of mastery

01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:30.660
Or guidance

01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:36.420
Below that in the on the stomach on the lower side of the abdomen

01:31:37.179 --> 01:31:40.979
You have in the lower side of the abdominal the left-hand side

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.780
you have a

01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:49.500
center which is very very important which is of swadishtana, which works out all the

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.800
Processes of

01:31:53.800 --> 01:31:57.340
Divine Love or all the techniques of Divine Love

01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:03.780
So then you go back again on the upper part of your stomach on the left hand side again

01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:08.699
The whole thing is working on left hand side then put your right hand on

01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:11.300
the heart

01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:17.600
Then please put your right hand  on the neck and

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:23.480
Turn your head like this between the corner of the neck and the shoulder

01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:31.140
Now take your right hand on top of your head and

01:32:33.070 --> 01:32:35.070
Press it hard on both the sides

01:32:41.340 --> 01:32:46.069
Now take your hand on the backside and put your head on

01:32:46.650 --> 01:32:50.810
The backside and press it hard on the backside

01:32:52.710 --> 01:32:53.910
Now

01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:57.950
The same hand now has to go on top of your head

01:32:58.980 --> 01:33:04.339
And has to be stretched like this on top of your head and press it hard

01:33:05.130 --> 01:33:07.130

That's all you have to do now you have to close your eyes, so here we go

01:33:18.120 --> 01:33:19.890
start our

01:33:19.890 --> 01:33:26.539
process of Kundalini awakening but to begin with I have to tell you again that

01:33:26.850 --> 01:33:33.469
You have to be in a very pleasant mood and you have to forgive yourself and you are not to feel guilty at all

01:33:34.050 --> 01:33:36.050

01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:41.719
Anything you have taken drugs. All right finished. If you are an alcoholic fit doesn't matter anything you have done

01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:46.069

01:33:47.610 --> 01:33:54.110
At this time it does not matter just forgive yourself now close your eyes put both the legs

01:33:56.580 --> 01:33:58.580
Parallel to each other

01:34:00.900 --> 01:34:04.879
Now take the right hand to your heart

01:34:05.670 --> 01:34:07.670
on the heart

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:14.760
Put this hand properly and here resides the spirit. So please ask me a question in your heart

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:21.580
Very intensely very important question. You can call me Shri Mataji, or you can call me Mother

01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:05.500
So the second question comes in as you are the spirit you are your master too

01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:11.200

01:35:42.929 --> 01:35:44.929

Press it hard here is the center which is always blocked when we feel guilty

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:21.600
God is

The ocean of love and

01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:28.980
Grace, but he is above all

01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:31.820
He is the ocean of forgiveness

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:36.180
So, please say sixteen times here mother. I am not guilty

01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:42.380
Please say sixteen times and if you still feel you can say it 108 times to punish yourself

01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:53.060
Mother I forgive everyone

01:40:55.110 --> 01:40:57.110
Now some of you

01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:00.560
All the time say

01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:02.640
That

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:05.149
It's very difficult Mother to forgive

01:41:06.030 --> 01:41:08.030
but whether you forgive or

01:41:08.130 --> 01:41:10.790
Do not forgive. It's a myth you

01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:14.149
Do not do anything in both the cases

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:20.360
but when you say I forgive you do not play into wrong hands, so

01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:23.020
Just say Mother, I forgive everyone

01:41:52.900 --> 01:41:54.900
Put back your hand

01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:00.120
You have to say it from your heart

01:42:02.170 --> 01:42:06.359
Now put back your hand on the backside of your head and

01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:09.920
Allow your head to rest on it

01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:14.720
Here just for your satisfaction. You can say Oh, Divine

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:21.520
If I have done any mistakes, please forgive me just for your satisfaction. Don't start counting your mistakes, please

01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:32.729
Push back your head from your heart how many times is not the point?

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:36.240
Push back your head back

01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:39.120
Keep your eyes shut

01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:43.760
Terrible heat

Now

01:42:49.929 --> 01:42:52.169
Take your hand on top of your head

01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:57.360
Open it out fully

01:42:58.820 --> 01:43:01.800
Press only your fontanelle

Put your right hand towards me

Like this

01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:12.400
Like this title like this

Right like this and with the left hand you see on top of your head

01:44:17.790 --> 01:44:22.379
you can bend your head a little and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your

01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:24.820
head

01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:27.940
Bend it. Bend. Bend your head. And it could be

Of the Holy Ghost. Is this the Brahma Chaitanya?

01:45:17.250 --> 01:45:22.080
Is this the love of God that we are feeling as cool breeze?

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:26.970
Ask any question three times in your heart put your head up towards

01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:29.760

01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:56.160
Hmm

01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:59.620
You were supporting a wrong person

01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:09.040
I knew this would don’t matter. Later on.  So Divine is very you see judges you very much.

01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:15.200

01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:22.229
Now those who are getting cool in their hands or on top of their heads

See how many have got it

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.040
See how many have got it

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:57.400
Alright, put them down. Despite all the trouble . Sardarji. Aap ko nahin hua Kya?

01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:00.760

Arey Bhai paar utar Gaye sant Jana Rey? Kyon bhai aap ko kyon nahin hua? Chalo. Haath karo meri taraf

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:08.650

Aaya nahin dhandak haath mein sar mein?

01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:13.400
Aa gayi na? They have got it.

01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:17.940
Arey Sardarji. Logon ka hi toh kaam Kar rahey Hain.

01:47:19.140 --> 01:47:23.720
Nanak Saheb ka hi toh kaam Kar rahey Hain. Unhone hi toh kaha hai.

01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:27.420
Hain na baat?

01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:32.280
They know this they know this very well, ah May God bless you

01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:36.900
Now what is to be done how to maintain it

01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:44.440
and How to keep it up and how to master it is the point you must master it

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.440
Some people haven't felt it. I know some people haven't felt. doesn't matter

01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:54.120
You were opening your eyes closing your eyes. You see that's not the way little intensity you should do

01:47:55.180 --> 01:48:00.930
All right, doesn't matter those who haven't got it should not worry those who have got it are very good

01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:04.320
They should all of them can come to a program

01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:12.330
They are having what they call a workshop where individually, they'll attend to you. You don't have to pay any money whatsoever

01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:15.420
That's a fact

01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:17.880
You don't have to pay any money whatsoever

01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:23.900
And there could be one or two persons as  As Christ has said, Beware of the murmuring souls

01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:28.320
But here people are over conscious of them I think.

01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:33.020
So it has done good to so many and will do good to so many of you

01:48:34.090 --> 01:48:37.709
What it does to you first of all that you feel extremely peaceful

01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:46.400
Extremely peaceful and then you develop this thoughtless awareness. You didn't feel sir. You didn't feel

01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:53.660
No? Surprising. I thought you will get it because you are so much there.  What about you?

01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:58.580
You too didn’t feel? You did feel it. he is absolutely gone into that

01:48:59.980 --> 01:49:05.980
It's good. It's very enjoyable you sleep very well tonight, and then you come and see for yourself

01:49:06.060 --> 01:49:12.330
What powers you have. what glory you have. What peace you are we talk of peace. Peace. Peace. Peace

01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:15.120
It's not outside peace has to be within

01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:19.520
when the people will have peace will then then there will be peaceful and

01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:28.160
There can be a cease some people who take time. It's not done that little time but one should work it out

01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:31.080
assiduously and with humility

01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:35.380
One should not aggress for that. by aggressing you Don't get it, isn't it?

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:39.640
it has to work out is the point there might be something wrong with you or

01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:42.209
Which can be corrected very easily

01:49:43.090 --> 01:49:45.569
So May God bless you despite the whole thing

01:49:45.569 --> 01:49:53.060
I am thankful that you all came and you got your realization and how I hope next time we won't have this problem in Adelaide

01:49:56.860 --> 01:50:01.580
Ek in ko realization den. this gentleman. I think he should get it in no time

01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:04.600
This gentleman here. Can you see that?

01:50:05.230 --> 01:50:10.350
Now see he can give realization these Sahaja Yogi's can give you know, you can get out

01:50:10.350 --> 01:50:13.950
I mean some people who haven't got it can get out and they can give realization now

01:50:13.950 --> 01:50:16.650
They have got the light they can give realization. You can give realization

01:50:17.320 --> 01:50:21.090
All right, please if you don't mind if you can just go there

01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:35.140
Anybody else who wants realization hasn't got it should come on this side and they'll work it out for him

01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:40.029
Anybody was not fighting. There's nothing to feel funny about it. Some people might not have got it

01:50:48.659 --> 01:50:51.618
Is she all right, she's got it this lady you

01:50:52.830 --> 01:50:58.969
Got the realization. I'm happy this one this lady here. Did you feel the realization?

01:50:59.639 --> 01:51:01.789
How good very good what?

01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:05.480
About you no, no

01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:11.760
No, just see her. She's not sure. Can you tell what their, In ko Jara dekhiye dono ko

01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:15.740
These two persons are here. Let's see them

01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:26.920
In any case I would like to shake hands with you, yes, sir. Forget it

01:51:29.680 --> 01:51:36.060
Last time they were these ‘Born Again’. they brought Bible to hit me.  Can you believe it?

01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:48.640
You see I'm against feminist movement that's why they are angry

01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:54.560
Has she got it? Has she got it? Eh?

01:51:56.180 --> 01:51:58.700
Just try on her.

01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:03.920
We worked on her. She wasn’t sure.

01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:06.120
No. no. no. no. There isn’t anything.

01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:10.840
Shouldn’t doubt it.  she's got it very well.

01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:15.700
You should bring your children. should have brought them children are the best they get it very fast

01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:25.080
Now this gentleman. Hello. What's your name? Give him realization. Just come along must give him he was supporting a wrong case. That's why

01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:33.880
Just laugh it up. It's now joy enjoy enjoy

01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:43.060
So, Adelaide has some great seekers also, I must say. Some very great seekers.

01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:55.540
These three are here from Rajyoga. They were hoping to have a word with you

01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:01.520
They are right-sided. Very right-sided you see. They are like nuns.

01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:08.480
They were wondering if they could speak to you.

01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:15.100
They can’t. They are on the right side. Rajyoga doesn’t work out.

01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:23.940
There is also television people still hanging outside. They might want to speak to you.

01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:25.960
Do you want to speak to them?

01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:31.360
I am really surprised at the television. Wasting their time with this nonsense.

01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:39.420
Why don’t they see these things and televise it and let people get it? You see, on the television, people can get realization.

01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:44.480
Yes

01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:56.480
Hello, ah, thank you, ah, beautiful

01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:08.460
So I should go and and talk to them

01:54:33.920 --> 01:54:37.480
Adelaide has a minimum number of people but very serious people.

01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:44.200
There is something great about Adelaide. Very nice people you see. And I think in the foundation you need some serious people also.

01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:46.640
Then later on it will grow

01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:50.380
I’ll go and see which way to go out.

01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:11.800
Haan. What were you doing? You are Rajyogis?

01:55:11.900 --> 01:55:13.900
Oh. God

01:55:21.740 --> 01:55:25.320
So, what is it want to get your realization or not?

01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:26.300
We have got realization.

01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:33.820
No. You haven’t. You haven’t got it I tell you. You have to feel a cool breeze in the hand.

01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:36.940
We feel love in the heart.

01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:40.420
Who is?

01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:42.980
Pyar

01:55:43.420 --> 01:55:51.080
Pyaar Kya? Pyaar (Pyar is Hindi words for love) is in the heart. Is in the heart. Everybody says that. Saying is not the point.

01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:52.760
It has to work. Love must work.

01:55:53.120 --> 01:56:00.700
Must act. Act. Act, you see. Unless and until you are not connected with that Divine love, you cannot act. It acts.

01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:10.380
Sitting down here you can act with that. See this is the thing is just believing that we have love doesn’t work out. Must act.

01:56:11.300 --> 01:56:19.020
We must experience that's the point I was saying see and that's what it is now we don't have any

01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:29.080
And the experience is

01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:32.480
as described by Adi Shankaracharya.

01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:37.360
Adi Shankaracharya has described it as (words in the Sanskrit language) Saleelam Saleelam, is the cool breeze in hands

01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:42.500
It’s all described in our Puranas and all that. But in the Brahmakumaris,

01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:50.960
I don't think they tell you all about it. Have you heard (unclear) Yes I have heard. I have heard. But I

01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:53.760
See I know but then work out I think

01:56:54.510 --> 01:56:57.560
You have to have simple self realization first

01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:00.280
That's very important. It's very right-sided

01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:08.500
Brahmakumaris  is right-sided according to us. Do you think so what is there? Let's say more on the right side is intellect

01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:14.080
It's more intellect and things like that and it has to come to the center

01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:17.980
Has to come to the center.I have met many people who are from Brahmakumaris.

01:57:18.260 --> 01:57:27.100
But somehow I feel that they should try to understand  also that’s it’s all, for one thing, is to become self-realized.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.120
But that is not what you think

01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:39.920
It's not that it's the thing that you get and all your central nervous. You must know must get it on your central nervous system

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:45.040
See now your faces are very red. this Vishuddhis are not alright. This centre is not alright.

01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:46.900
This centre is not alright.

01:57:46.900 --> 01:57:50.320
Faces are very red for normal. You have to be very normal people.

01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:56.660
Extremely normal. in normal life you have to   live like Christ lived like everybody lives.

01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:00.900
There is no abnormality needed at all. To be absolutely normal life.

01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:03.040
What do you mean by normal life? Worldly people?

01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:03.540
ah

01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:10.920
Worldly people. You should live like worldly people. Actually, we have no place for sanyasa in Sahaja Yoga.

01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:18.200
We don’t believe in sanyas.
Brahmakumaris is in the family path.

01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:24.920
Yes. But the difference is that we believe in the experience of the realization

01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:28.400
and the manifestation of it. That we should be able to raise the Kundalini

01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:34.140
If you can raise the Kundalini, can give realization and you are master of that, then you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:58:34.920 --> 01:58:36.920
That's the point is

01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:45.840
Think it over. Give it a thought. Alright. Think it over. Think it over. May God bless you. Thank you. Thank you.

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:53.720
This ABC lady is quite sensible about these crazy people

01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:57.480
and she would like to come back to the house and in a very quiet atmosphere, to talk with you.

01:58:57.480 --> 01:58:59.420
ABC? Who’s that?

01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:03.260
They are from 7.30 reporters.

01:59:03.300 --> 01:59:05.860
Yes. the Others rest of them have got?

01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:11.420
There are some waiting in front talking to people who are going out. We have arranged for them to meet you

01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:17.200
First send the Sahaj Yogis to tell them we have got realization. Pretending. First send the Sahaja Yogis.

01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:27.740
Ho Gaya tum. Tum ko thanda aaya key nahin? Aaa Gaya. Achha. Kya naam hai tumahara? Khush Raho. Khush Raho.

02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:17.660
I am Robert’s mother. Nirmala’s mother

02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:20.500
I know. You know what has happened.

02:00:20.560 --> 02:00:25.500
It’s a serious thing with Nirmala I don’t know with this woman. You could blame her for this.

02:00:25.720 --> 02:00:29.880
She is the one who has just brain-washed Nirmala

02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:32.840
I have got a letter for her. I have got a thing from her.

02:00:33.040 --> 02:00:40.540
They brain-washed her and brain-washing made Nirmala so dominating, so dominating that Robert got into trouble.

02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:43.860
He has very bad pneumonia. When he came in the ashram

02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:49.760
I had such a bad right heart. I was quite worried and I said, Who’s that? He said, Robert. Robert.

02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:52.020
How did he get such a horrible thing?

02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:55.660
Then I realized, He had this pneumonia.

02:00:57.700 --> 02:01:04.960
I think Nirmal has to send him to Rome to get alright. I said what’s this? Why did you learn this dominating stuff? Why were you dominating?

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:10.020
It’s very wrong. I think she could have ruined his life and that’s the letter she had given.

02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:14.620
How do you do Madam? How do you?

02:01:19.180 --> 02:01:21.180
How are you

02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:31.360
Ah. Good. Thank you. Look at these one or two persons here and there. They are just trying to trouble me. Doesn’t matter. It’s alright. But people got realization

02:01:32.720 --> 02:01:36.620
it’s all right. It’s alright. After all, a ءother has to face all this.

02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:41.840
I come all the way from Iceland.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.800
Really imagine from Iceland. Oh my God

02:01:48.140 --> 02:01:50.560
All the way from Iceland I have to go to

02:01:51.080 --> 02:01:57.489
Iceland also some time. We have some friends in Iceland. There are only 2000 families that have forgotten their names

02:02:07.380 --> 02:02:09.380
Nice all right

02:02:13.829 --> 02:02:15.110
Yes, I know

02:02:15.110 --> 02:02:21.229
I think you better come and tell these people here outside this television people should understand they give so much importance to them

02:02:21.239 --> 02:02:23.130
That's why they talk

02:02:23.130 --> 02:02:25.130
See they are not

02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:36.820
it’s a very sad thing.

02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:42.280
To give importance to the wrong type of people. And she told all lies. It was all lies. I mean, I never take money.

02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:44.280
What's the question of taking money at all?

02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:51.320
Somebody might give some jewellery or something. I auction it out. I never touch anything.

02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:54.380
What is the need and  I mean I am the one who is telling everyone not to take any money.

02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:07.220
I don’t know. Why don’t they seek themselves? What happened to you, my child?

02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:13.180
Why you didn't get it, sorry. You didn’t get your realization?

02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:21.220
I tell you what exactly, you didn’t forgive. You should forgive everyone.

02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:28.660
You couldn’t forgive them?

02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:31.760
Alright. Forgive. Forgive everyone.

02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:37.700
I mean even my Arab doing things wrong, I mean I was something.

02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:43.520
No. No. Just forgive yourself and I’ll work it out. You just forgive.Don’t say all that.

02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:46.760
Don't say anything to yourself just to forgive yourself. That's for me

02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:50.740
What Christ has told you. On the cross he said, Forgive.

02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:57.120
He forgave and we have to forgive. Alright. Started?

02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:03.600
It’s working? Can you feel it? Is it going now? Can you feel the cool breeze?

02:04:03.600 --> 02:04:04.800
Do it again. Do it again.

02:04:07.520 --> 02:04:12.700
Alright. Let’s see. Now. Is it. Now see. You got your realization.

02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:17.280
Forgive forgive from your heart forgive yourself first of all

02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:19.950
forgive forgive forgive

02:04:20.350 --> 02:04:22.350
now forgive everyone

02:04:22.540 --> 02:04:24.370
forgive everyone

02:04:24.370 --> 02:04:26.360
forgive now

02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:29.620
got it?

02:04:29.620 --> 02:04:31.980
Yes. I can. God bless you. Thanks.

02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:44.820
She was struck by lightning, Shri Mataji.

02:04:53.140 --> 02:04:59.460
Tell me that they feel very high and very very strong vibration, but I can't feel it on the hand. So

02:05:25.740 --> 02:05:28.300
Now, let's see

02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:33.380
Feeling it? Not yet?

02:05:43.300 --> 02:05:45.300
Little bit

02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:53.000
You have to work on the photograph. Alright.

02:05:58.500 --> 02:06:00.500
Must forgive.

02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:02.560
forgive

02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:09.980
Hello. You have got it. I can see that. Good. May God bless you.

02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:13.860
Nice nice I came for you people

You come from where from Fiji? Sri Lanka? Achha.Got all of you. Got your realization.

02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:39.300
What is their surname?

02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:42.420
Ah

02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:46.140
She is your sister? It was nice meeting you really.

02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:56.760
I know. I know. He is a Veena player. I know, I know, I know him very well.  Oh. She wrote to me. Is very good. He had got his realization and is really enjoying.

02:06:58.120 --> 02:07:00.300
Just started now started yeah

02:07:01.420 --> 02:07:03.600
That’s the mantra you have to say, of Vishnumaya mantra you have to say.

02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:07.220
Right start it. Now. How are you?

02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:12.880
Got it.  I don’t know if I have got it. You have. You have. You have I know.

02:07:12.880 --> 02:07:13.760
Sit down.

02:07:21.260 --> 02:07:26.160
Don’t doubt. It’s there. There.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:34.140
I don't know that I try too hard. You should not try. Just leave it.

02:07:34.520 --> 02:07:36.860
Just don’t try. You cannot try. Just leave it.

02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:40.960
Ha now now just say

02:07:41.900 --> 02:07:44.880
alright. that's it

02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:48.740
Shouldn't try it's just it's a spontaneous thing. You cannot try All Right

02:07:49.580 --> 02:07:51.580
You have got it.

02:07:51.620 --> 02:07:59.140
Really got it. She is got it in a big way.

02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:03.320
Thank you . found out

02:08:05.960 --> 02:08:10.380
now laugh. Laugh. And laugh.  It’s so simple.

02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:16.460
Now, enjoy yourself. Enjoy is the point.

02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:23.240
After all the whole thing is all finished. Now, you all got it.

02:08:30.380 --> 02:08:35.400
So good so beautiful you want to take photograph. All right

02:08:37.900 --> 02:08:42.720
So now what's the matter I was reading about you and you arrived in Adelaide

02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:45.460
Just reading about you. Yes

02:08:49.600 --> 02:08:51.720
It just works spontaneously, isn’t it.

02:08:51.880 --> 02:08:56.880
Of course. I think my Kundalini was partly raised and it is going to drive me a bit mad.

02:08:57.620 --> 02:08:59.620
(unclear) my husband.

02:09:00.220 --> 02:09:02.760
Who did that؟
Patrick (unclear)

02:09:03.020 --> 02:09:11.860
Oh. Baba. They shouldn’t do like that. (unclear) They ruined you completely.

02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:15.080
They can’t do it. Must have an authority to do it.

02:09:17.080 --> 02:09:21.040
Who's this Patrik?
He is a spiritual leader.

02:09:23.100 --> 02:09:27.640
it’s not good. Very bad.

02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:41.480
Don't go to these people horrible they take money for that.

02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:54.040
So we got very nice people later on and so many of them got realization the lady has gone now she was making all false

02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:56.640
allegations. This is, I mean I have never heard about these.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:04.360
some fake leader has done it.

02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:09.680
All right good

02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:19.540
Shri Mataji they came to the ashram nearly one year ago and got their realization.

02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:25.880
Now it’s confirmed. Alright. God bless you.

02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:34.040
Welcome to Adelaide. It’s nice meeting you.
it’s alright. It’s a joke.

02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:40.160
And anyway all falsehood the main thing is all falsehood so I didn't know whether to laugh or to say something

02:10:40.929 --> 02:10:42.929
but it's a fact you see when

02:10:44.469 --> 02:10:45.849
Somebody

02:10:45.849 --> 02:10:51.569
Something goes wrong or something frustrated. They try to behave like that. What's the wrong thing? See?

02:10:51.609 --> 02:10:57.629
you should try to be more peaceful and see for yourself and not to just

02:10:59.019 --> 02:11:01.019
Get you to problems

02:11:01.239 --> 02:11:05.578
Because she could not say anything to us. I mean what was wrong with us? I mean nothing

02:11:06.579 --> 02:11:12.628
Maybe somebody might have dominated that I can't say that but that doesn't mean that the whole of sahaja. Yoga is like that

02:11:14.640 --> 02:11:16.640
Some people can dominate you. It’s alright.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:28.160
Nice to meet you and a smile  is the most beautiful thing that I want to see

02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:36.900
So. You got it. Despite all the problems.

02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:40.700
Don't you worry?

02:11:41.820 --> 02:11:45.260
Expect your teachings, your philosophy, more than other countries.

02:11:45.540 --> 02:11:51.660
Yes. That’s true. For example, Austria.

02:11:51.700 --> 02:11:56.900
Austria is very good, England. And

02:11:57.440 --> 02:12:01.180
I would say, the best is Italy.

02:12:02.620 --> 02:12:03.820
the

02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:09.280
And then the second best could be Australia I would say. I don’t know how to compare,

02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:11.340
But in India, of course, they know what it is

02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:13.860
So I have thousands and thousands of people who got realization.

02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:19.920
In India there are so many people who are in need of some sort of a hope,

02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:23.500
That you would have a big influence on them

02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:29.700
Is that the way you see it, that you have a very very large population, a lot of people looking for hope.  yes

02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:32.100
Apart from you see.

02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:36.240
Once you get realization you see this problem of population is solved

02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:43.180
you see this problem of population is solved. You see, a person becomes very dynamic. They become very creative. They start doing dynamic work

02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:49.860
They improve financially also. All of them have improved financially, everyone. So, it’s a thing of

02:12:50.380 --> 02:12:56.200
Energy that is within us which we have not yet used which comes into use and we become dynamic.

02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:00.400
You are very happy soul

02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:04.240
Yes I am. That’s what. Sometimes they don’t like

02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:10.720
To see me very happy because they think I'm ignorant but why I am happy, I'll tell you and I have great hopes

02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:15.900
I am sure this world is going to be a beautiful place. That’s why I am so happy.

02:13:15.940 --> 02:13:19.020
I am happy because I know now

02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:23.840
the world is going to be a very very happy place for all of us to live very happily.

02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:29.100
But you do say there are a lot of useless people in the world. What do you do with those useless people?

02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:33.400
I don’t know what to do with them because you see there is no room even in the hell.

02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:35.240
You see, I don’t know where will they go.

02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:38.760
They might hang in the limbo or something like that

02:13:38.940 --> 02:13:45.320
But why don’t they see, what is their use? Why they have come on this Earth?

02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:49.660
They might you see some people some people

02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:56.920
take after the multitudes. So, may be if there are many people who are realized souls, they can.

02:13:58.700 --> 02:14:03.460
You want to copy that letter? Give me a copy of that. It was a very short Interview.

02:14:10.860 --> 02:14:12.860
I can hold it if you like.

02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:21.700
How do you feel about tonight’s meeting? To your satisfaction?

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.700
You see this doesn't stop me from giving realization

02:14:25.719 --> 02:14:27.719
most of them got realization that

02:14:27.889 --> 02:14:33.519
But you see this shows that people can can go very low sometimes you know doors of sahaja

02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:40.620
Yoga are open to everyone even to a convict to a criminal all kinds of people coming and we don't also find out what sort

02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:44.380
Of life they have had in the past we say
Forget the past. Forget the past.

02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:47.220
But sometimes you know, they come from complicated

02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:51.040
lives and then they show that

02:14:52.489 --> 02:14:55.448
It's all right doesn't matter. It's not so important, but

02:14:56.030 --> 02:14:57.830
One has to have certain

02:14:57.830 --> 02:15:00.249
Civil ideas that when you are in a meeting

02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:04.140
Allow me to speak I would have asked us the question stated on even have full chance

02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:09.900
But she went along with him to speak and she made all false absolutely false allegations, which has no meaning

02:15:09.909 --> 02:15:12.940
I think the first thing she says that somebody gave me

02:15:14.060 --> 02:15:17.679
$10,000. What do I care for ten thousand dollars. It has no meaning to be drawn

02:15:17.679 --> 02:15:20.829
I mean I doesn't have to be ten thousand dollars

02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:24.320
I must have said spend much more than that much much more

02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:28.920
for Sahaja Yoga because I think it’s very important. For me, that’s the most important thing.

02:15:29.020 --> 02:15:33.120
Why should I take many ways we use what is what is the use of money to me?

02:15:33.680 --> 02:15:37.520
And I'm the one talking from the tops of the mountains that you should have

02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:44.040
Maybe some people might have given some jewellery as she says so-called see they are all of that we auction

02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:45.590
We auction it

02:15:45.590 --> 02:15:48.409
I don't know everything belongs to me, whatever I have

02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:53.340
So it is a wrong idea talk like this when others are sitting

02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:57.300
Anxiously waiting for a very important thing in their lives, which is Self Realization

02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:03.380
(unclear) the friend of her’s who died (unclear)

02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:11.480
No, it’s wrong. She should tell us the name of the person first of all. Nobody said they are evil people, nobody.

02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:14.560
Evil word we don’t use in Sahaja Yoga.

02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:17.700
That's not the way we are . We don’t tell them like that

02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:22.240
but maybe see somebody like her might have said to her.

02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:24.830
I don't know must be in the group someone like her

02:16:24.830 --> 02:16:30.649
Maybe there might have said it but this word we don't we are not supposed to use at all such words to anyone now

02:16:30.650 --> 02:16:31.369
She says he died

02:16:31.369 --> 02:16:33.829
I tasked the name she would tell the name of the person who died

02:16:34.019 --> 02:16:39.108
And then she said somebody has given me ten thousand dollars. Who is that person? She didn't tell me the name of that person

02:16:39.108 --> 02:16:42.100
So this is very ambiguous things to say

02:16:45.700 --> 02:16:47.320
About

02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:48.200
I

02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:54.560
she said she gave you everything she had. She was cleaning floors, she was doing all things like that.

02:16:55.220 --> 02:16:58.320
But that you doing anything.  Men also do in Sahaja Yoga.

02:16:58.340 --> 02:16:58.650
yoga

02:16:58.650 --> 02:17:03.240
You see, there is nothing like() Men also clean daily in their own ashrams and they have to do it.

02:17:03.260 --> 02:17:09.640
Actually, she was staying with a person where a lady was leader herself. And there all ladies were doing like this.

02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:14.460
But she has ruined somebody’s life by telling her that you must dominate your husbands.

02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:19.420
Must dominate. And by domination, this fellow got a horrible type of pneumonia. And he was going to die.

02:17:19.420 --> 02:17:22.840
But I didn't want to say all the season after all if she has no graces

02:17:22.849 --> 02:17:24.660
It's all right, but I shouldn't say these things

02:17:24.660 --> 02:17:26.740
there's a letter about that that she

02:17:27.180 --> 02:17:32.280
she did all these things and that’s why they said (unclear) But she was teaching people that you must dominate.

02:17:33.060 --> 02:17:36.980
Teaching this leader also you must dominate. This is our right to dominate.

02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:42.560
Why did they dominate us? She is sort of a feminist woman an extreme type of a feminist.

02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:48.880
And we don't have feminists or all these things what we have is normal people who love each other

02:17:50.300 --> 02:17:56.800
See when you marry you should live like a wife and a husband not like quarreling all the time for your rights and duties

02:17:56.920 --> 02:17:58.920
of this

02:17:58.980 --> 02:18:01.880
How do you see the role of the wife?

02:18:02.060 --> 02:18:05.740
Well, I just say that there are two wheels on a chariot.

02:18:05.740 --> 02:18:10.420
all right, one on the left on the right now thing is the right and the left are

02:18:11.090 --> 02:18:12.819
Equal, but they are not similar

02:18:12.819 --> 02:18:17.019
that's the point they are equal but not similar and if a

02:18:17.389 --> 02:18:21.039
Woman tries to be a man is a wrong thing or a woman tries to me

02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:24.580
A man tries to be a woman is a wrong now

02:18:24.580 --> 02:18:28.800
Now, the thing is woman loves to have a home and homemaking is her own personal

02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:35.380
Qualities and all that. She should look after the home. There's nothing wrong in it. It's a very good thing. It's very satisfying

02:18:36.040 --> 02:18:43.140
I am myself a very home-loving person. I have got grandchildren. I have got my daughter married.

02:18:43.140 --> 02:18:45.939
I'm very big social life as you know

02:18:45.940 --> 02:18:52.480
my husband is the Big Boss there, so I have to attend many parties and all that. Everything I do but I do also Sahaja Yoga.

02:18:52.900 --> 02:19:00.460
But I don’t think in any way in doing my household duties,  on the contrary, I enjoy.

02:19:07.420 --> 02:19:10.260
Just put on the lights, please.

02:19:31.540 --> 02:19:33.190
What about the

02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:37.300
future of your sect? Where do you see the group’s future lie?

02:19:37.300 --> 02:19:38.360
This is not a sect.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:41.540
We don’t call it a sect. It’s a movement

02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:44.280
within yourself. It’s an

02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:50.640
Evolutionary process as a fish came out of the water and became a reptile in the same way

02:19:50.700 --> 02:19:56.120
Human beings have to become something more. It's a movement within and that is something so natural and

02:19:56.980 --> 02:20:03.120
Absolutely a living process. It has nothing to do with any sect or we don't have any memberships. We don't have any

02:20:03.140 --> 02:20:04.860
payments for that. nothing of that kind

02:20:04.940 --> 02:20:09.880
Anybody who wants to try should try. And as long as they want they can stay or go away.

02:20:09.980 --> 02:20:12.440
But if somebody tried to trouble us, then we have to say you go away.

02:20:12.860 --> 02:20:17.360
Because we asked her to go away that proves at least that we wanted her to go away

02:20:17.520 --> 02:20:19.680
She didn’t go away. If she didn’t like it, why didn’t she go?

02:20:20.400 --> 02:20:24.020
But what about the future of the movement?
Where do you see that?

02:20:25.100 --> 02:20:27.100
I am very hopeful.
I am very happy about it.

02:20:27.100 --> 02:20:33.660
I think a day will come when many people will be realized souls and the kingdom of God is about to come.

02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:37.140
But So many movements come and go. I mean.

02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:41.280
That’s it. I have told about them openly. I have told about them. From 1970

02:20:41.320 --> 02:20:41.900
I 've  been shouting.

02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:44.520
I had also told them in America on the

02:20:44.600 --> 02:20:48.720
Television  that AIDS is going to come. The way you are behaving. Give up these ideas

02:20:48.740 --> 02:20:53.660
This is not proper, but they wouldn't like me and they were very angry with me especially in San Francisco

02:20:53.660 --> 02:20:57.300
they got so angry. What are you talking? We don’t want to advertise for you

02:20:57.440 --> 02:21:02.620
You see this is the trouble is. They didn’t like it at that time when I told them because as a Mother I have to tell the truth.

02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:06.460
isn’t it? They didn’t like it when I told them you shouldn’t do these wrong things.

02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:09.780
But it happened that way.

02:21:10.100 --> 02:21:12.400
Hmm. Thank you very much for (unclear)

02:21:12.460 --> 02:21:14.540
May God bless you.

02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:17.040
What is he doing now? From that side? Alright. Alright.

02:21:17.940 --> 02:21:20.740
Just to see. Where are you going from here?

02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:25.540
Here I am going to …for a day because I am having a very hectic time.

02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:33.100
And then I’ll be going via Hong Kong to Bombay. I am also building a house for my husband in Poona.

02:21:33.620 --> 02:21:38.120
So, in between, I am seeing the house then coming out doing my work.

02:21:38.460 --> 02:21:44.060
Lots of things are to be done but in Sahaja Yoga, you don’t feel tired. And you become really dynamic.

02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:50.580
Really don’t feel tired. You feel so dynamic and so happy that you don’t feel that. You can do so many things together.

02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:54.240
Now, I am sixty-five years of age, you can imagine.

02:21:54.480 --> 02:21:57.400
I can. Thank you very much.

02:21:57.400 --> 02:21:59.000
Thank you. May God bless you.

02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:02.240
So which one is going to come?

02:22:02.820 --> 02:22:04.820
We have CBIBC

02:22:07.120 --> 02:22:09.660
Alright. They are still waiting here. May God bless you.

02:22:09.660 --> 02:22:12.800
We have been really concerned about you tonight, Shri Mataji.

02:22:12.980 --> 02:22:15.220
They are real ones, they are the good ones.

02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:25.160
That’s what Adelaide is. You see, there are very good people here and some stupid also
