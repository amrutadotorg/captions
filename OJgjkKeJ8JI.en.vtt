00:00:04.808 --> 00:00:11.410
“The thought process can start
by your conditioning or by your ego”

00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:20.806
In the West we have become very speedy,
no doubt,

00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:29.278
and to bring down this speed we have to use

00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:44.254
meditative process that we feel our peace
within ourselves.

00:00:48.562 --> 00:00:54.671
Also the thoughts are bombarding our minds

00:00:56.373 --> 00:01:03.147
and we react very fast

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:11.903
to others and to these thoughts.

00:01:14.253 --> 00:01:18.437
So one has to be aware,

00:01:20.339 --> 00:01:27.441
one has to be knowing what is happening
within yourself,

00:01:30.604 --> 00:01:35.576
that the thoughts are bombarding you,

00:01:36.026 --> 00:01:40.718
you are trying to ascend

00:01:42.355 --> 00:01:50.347
and you find it very difficult to get rid
of the thoughts.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.171
The thought process can start

00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:05.410
by your conditioning or by your ego –
only two problems.

00:02:12.573 --> 00:02:18.143
And you are the one who is under
the challenge.

00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:27.746
So you have got these simple people
in the village

00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:38.585
who start watching everything but they
do not react.

00:02:39.205 --> 00:02:46.379
If you do not react then your thoughts
will give up.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:58.335
So the first thing should be to watch
yourself that you are not reacting,

00:03:00.698 --> 00:03:08.108
but you are experiencing and enjoying
the silence,

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.608
the subtleties, the beauty, the glory

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:22.345
of your being as well as whatever
is around you.

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:29.885
You don’t have to force yourself to break
this habit,

00:03:32.793 --> 00:03:37.218
but just to be on the watch-out.

00:03:39.858 --> 00:03:46.017
It’s not necessary to talk too much
about it also,

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.343
nor it is necessary

00:03:57.801 --> 00:04:02.329
to think about anything.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.868
Because supposing you see a tree –
so it’s a tree only.

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.639
What are we going to think about it?

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.273
And whatever we may think about it,
it’s going to be the tree!

00:04:21.013 --> 00:04:26.684
So there’s no harm in appearing little bit
stupid – doesn’t matter.

00:04:26.885 --> 00:04:33.620
But this is the basic thing, is, that when
we start analyzing,

00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:39.027
we are breaking our own nerves,

00:04:39.424 --> 00:04:47.463
and poisoning our own mind and brain.

00:04:50.126 --> 00:04:59.197
So to watch something without analysis,
without thinking about it, is reality.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.670
If you can achieve that point where you
watch everything

00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:11.605
without reacting, you are in reality,

00:05:16.707 --> 00:05:22.967
and then only the penetration

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:27.840
into the subtleties of your surroundings,

00:05:28.044 --> 00:05:32.759
of your relationships, your friendships,

00:05:35.622 --> 00:05:41.994
the whole universe, dawns upon you.

00:05:44.936 --> 00:05:48.924
So to judge others, to think of others,

00:05:49.125 --> 00:05:55.042
what they are doing, what’s wrong
with them,

00:05:56.605 --> 00:06:06.650
about anything whatsoever you may think is
wrong – is not going to be corrected.

00:06:07.782 --> 00:06:12.824
Like I know some people who are specially
bureaucrats,

00:06:13.025 --> 00:06:19.431
they are travelling, supposing, by the car.

00:06:19.632 --> 00:06:24.931
Then they will say, “I think, you see,
this road should have gone this way”,

00:06:25.197 --> 00:06:30.118
or “I think it would have been nice
if this house was facing the other way” –

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:37.582
but it’s not, you see? It is not going
to face [that way].

00:06:37.995 --> 00:06:45.493
It is going to be the way it is, so what is
the use of wasting your brain,

00:06:45.693 --> 00:06:50.983
your mind, your thought, in suggesting
something

00:06:51.184 --> 00:06:58.646
which doesn’t work out, and never going
to work out either.

00:07:00.084 --> 00:07:04.193
So when we start like, “I think

00:07:04.944 --> 00:07:11.037
these trees should have been little
taller” – but they are not!

00:07:13.514 --> 00:07:16.045
“I think

00:07:20.737 --> 00:07:28.597
that the crows should stop their noise” –
they will not.

00:07:30.897 --> 00:07:37.485
So just accept it. Acceptance is the way

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:44.730
we are going to enjoy. But acceptance
doesn’t mean tolerance,

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:51.137
because tolerance means you have to work
very hard

00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:55.292
to accept that the trees are of the same
height –

00:07:55.493 --> 00:07:58.518
they can’t grow – it’s too much for you.

00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:04.899
When you say, “I have to tolerate it, you
see, because my mind doesn’t accept.”

00:08:10.946 --> 00:08:17.484
So acceptance as it is whatever you see,
acceptance.

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:21.813
And that is how people grow I have seen,
those who start accepting.

00:08:22.014 --> 00:08:29.424
That’s the sign. That’s the sign of their
strength and their depth.

00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:36.710
Like the propensity of this Mother Earth,
She is what She is.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:46.110
And She bears whatever is there.

00:08:49.449 --> 00:08:52.856
If you put a heavy thing on Her,

00:08:53.057 --> 00:08:57.750
She’ll put equal and opposite force
and bear it.

00:08:57.951 --> 00:09:03.926
She doesn’t say, “I’m tolerating it, I am
exerting any pressure”.

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:07.461
But She is just accepting.

00:09:10.769 --> 00:09:16.915
So the witnessing and awareness develops

00:09:17.116 --> 00:09:22.510
when we start just accepting things
as they are.

00:09:23.511 --> 00:09:27.594
“I think” doesn’t work out.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:36.317
“I think it would have been better like
this” doesn’t work out.

00:09:39.492 --> 00:09:43.739
Then second problem is “I like”.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:53.090
Now, “I like to eat a cake” - but there is
no cake, what to do?

00:09:55.445 --> 00:10:00.375
Now, whatever is there, enjoy it as a cake.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:09.335
But if you go on thinking like that –
“I like whatever is not here” –

00:10:09.536 --> 00:10:14.157
you can never be happy, as simple as that.

00:10:14.358 --> 00:10:22.031
You have to say, “I like whatever is there.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:29.220
I enjoy whatever is there”. Then that’s
the reality.

00:10:29.421 --> 00:10:37.129
Whatever doesn’t exist, if you like it,

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:43.302
so what can anybody do about it?

00:10:46.993 --> 00:10:53.516
It works out in so many ways, in so many
facets in life,

00:10:53.717 --> 00:11:02.221
that advantage is taken by people because
we become so vulnerable

00:11:02.422 --> 00:11:07.822
to our likes and dislikes that
the entrepreneurs take over

00:11:08.023 --> 00:11:14.663
and they create likes and dislikes in our
heads, and put ideas every day.

00:11:14.864 --> 00:11:17.951
I’ve seen it now, how they do it,

00:11:18.152 --> 00:11:22.262
through television, through newspapers,
through this, that.

00:11:22.463 --> 00:11:26.692
So then you say, “Now, I like this”.

00:11:27.948 --> 00:11:33.382
But from where this liking has come
is the conditioning

00:11:33.583 --> 00:11:37.167
which is put into your head.

00:11:40.651 --> 00:11:46.380
So you are a slave of that conditioning.

00:11:49.692 --> 00:11:58.880
“I only like roses and I don’t like
any other flower”.

00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:06.901
But why? Why you don’t like
any other flower?

00:12:11.656 --> 00:12:20.134
And for such things whatever we have
we miss the joy.

00:12:23.234 --> 00:12:31.312
So the second part should be that,
“Enjoy everything.”

00:12:34.903 --> 00:12:38.143
“Why am I here?

00:12:42.068 --> 00:12:47.549
It’s not a very comfortable place
by any chance,

00:12:49.142 --> 00:12:51.931
so why am I here?”

00:12:55.602 --> 00:12:59.823
To enjoy each other.

00:13:02.512 --> 00:13:06.152
To enjoy your own being.

00:13:06.353 --> 00:13:14.349
The more divergence you have outside,
appealing to your ego and conditioning,

00:13:14.992 --> 00:13:19.675
the more your mind is busy with that,

00:13:22.788 --> 00:13:29.957
then you cannot enjoy anything.
