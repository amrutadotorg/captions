00:40.375 --> 00:46.500
In India they were all waiting for the monsoons

00:48.250 --> 00:50.709
and they are so worried

00:52.041 --> 00:54.333
because the rain did not come.

00:55.500 --> 01:00.375
So, I was giving bandhan to the rain and it came here

01:13.500 --> 01:17.208
And now also they have  told,

01:17.667 --> 01:21.333
on the television, that it is going to rain in India.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.458
But first in Italy!

01:30.667 --> 01:34.667
I was told that in Italy you needed rain very much

01:35.542 --> 01:38.500
and the first rain you had,

01:41.417 --> 01:46.375
few days back, and now this the second one.

01:47.709 --> 01:56.250
Because all the understanding

01:57.667 --> 02:06.125
of the problems of our farmers is there.

02:09.041 --> 02:12.125
And the rain, you see, is so kind

02:13.667 --> 02:20.375
that it works at the right time.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.667
I am surprised

02:25.041 --> 02:32.000
at the quick behaviour and obedience of the rain.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.542
Today is a great day, for all of us,  because

02:41.208 --> 02:45.458
we are celebrating the Guru Puja

02:46.333 --> 02:49.291
and remembering all the great Gurus

02:50.583 --> 02:56.542
who came on this earth to teach the world about the truth.

02:58.417 --> 03:01.375
So many of them were [there].

03:02.458 --> 03:04.583
And they tried their level best

03:05.667 --> 03:09.542
to explain to humanity what is spirituality.

03:11.041 --> 03:17.041
But it’s such a disparity that people never understood

03:17.583 --> 03:22.000
that spirituality is the most important thing we need.

03:23.125 --> 03:26.291
That we have to be one with the Divine Power.

03:27.083 --> 03:31.041
All their endeavours have been in the wrong direction.

03:33.333 --> 03:40.333
First of course they were very intelligent, more than animals,

03:41.041 --> 03:47.375
and started seeking, not the truth,

03:48.500 --> 03:51.375
but some sort of a self

03:52.208 --> 03:55.417
-emancipation I should say, I don’t know  what to say, call it –

03:56.333 --> 03:58.417
self-progress.

03:59.542 --> 04:04.333
And in that they lost that they have to first seek spirituality,

04:05.291 --> 04:07.500
which is the most important thing.

04:10.000 --> 04:18.208
But, we had two types of journeys:

04:20.041 --> 04:28.083
one is through the left side or another through the right side.

04:30.208 --> 04:33.125
In India, I don’t know why,

04:33.542 --> 04:39.542
we had lots of people who went into the jungles and became saints

04:40.667 --> 04:44.458
but they were doing right side tapasya.

04:46.333 --> 04:51.417
That is, going into the five elements

04:52.667 --> 04:57.417
one after another; and mastering the five elements.

04:58.458 --> 05:03.333
Of course there is truth in it, no doubt.

05:04.417 --> 05:07.542
You have seen how a candle

05:13.625 --> 05:19.625
how a candle tells you as to what is your position inside:

05:21.000 --> 05:24.125
if you are possessed or if you are not,

05:24.417 --> 05:27.291
a candle can tell you – can you imagine?

05:28.166 --> 05:33.291
Candle is so much knowledgable.

05:34.542 --> 05:41.583
Supposing you have a heart, heart trouble –

05:42.208 --> 05:44.208
the candle will show.

05:45.709 --> 05:52.709
And if you treat yourself with a candle, you can cure yourself.

05:54.291 --> 05:59.291
So, it is so sensitive

05:59.709 --> 06:03.667
not that it can cure, but also so competent,

06:04.500 --> 06:08.417
not that it shows you that you are sick and you have problems

06:08.583 --> 06:11.375
but that it is competent to cure you.

06:13.333 --> 06:20.250
Thats why, in India, Agni was worshipped,

06:21.125 --> 06:27.166
this  light was worshipped,

06:27.500 --> 06:31.250
the fire was worshipped, that was worshipped first.

06:33.208 --> 06:39.166
They must have discovered that the fire knows everything,

06:42.041 --> 06:48.291
so the inner, inner awareness of all these elements,

06:49.625 --> 06:55.500
they knew about it and thats why they worshipped those elements.

06:56.709 --> 07:04.375
So before the Puja they used to call all the Deities who belonged

07:05.166 --> 07:10.583
to those elements to witness their Puja.

07:12.625 --> 07:15.625
But that turned out to be right sided movement.

07:19.542 --> 07:24.583
Without the left side right side is very dangerous.

07:27.667 --> 07:32.333
If you don’t have right side of course

07:33.125 --> 07:38.208
it’s a big dangerous thing also. But first you must have

07:39.333 --> 07:42.333
development of your left side.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.583
That is what, to begin with, we had in Sahaja Yoga.

07:48.709 --> 07:56.500
Left side is compassion, is love, universal feeling,

07:58.333 --> 08:03.250
or we can say it’s the blessings of the Devi

08:04.041 --> 08:08.375
which are described you know it, in the Devi Mahatmyam,

08:09.375 --> 08:14.250
that the Goddess resides within you as so many things.

08:16.291 --> 08:19.417
She resides within you as shraddha.

08:20.250 --> 08:24.375
as, She resides in you as sleep,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.542
She resides in you as illusion, bhranti.

08:29.709 --> 08:33.375
All kinds of things are there on the left-hand side,

08:33.709 --> 08:36.625
which are already described.

08:37.458 --> 08:42.041
And when I told you about Sahaja Yoga,

08:42.458 --> 08:46.291
I wanted to make your left side very strong.

08:47.625 --> 08:51.333
Those who, people who, took to right side

08:51.667 --> 08:56.542
became very aggressive people, and they had mastered

08:57.083 --> 09:01.250
the essence of these five elements, that’s alright. But

09:02.417 --> 09:05.375
they were extremely hot-tempered,

09:06.333 --> 09:11.458
so much so that they used to curse people, curse them.

09:12.333 --> 09:17.291
They used to say things which were not kind;

09:18.208 --> 09:21.125
and they didn’t believe in the universality.

09:22.542 --> 09:27.583
It was such a dangerous thing that they took.

09:29.125 --> 09:33.291
In Indian shastras you can see many incidents

09:34.041 --> 09:38.709
where people gave a curse, sharp, very common.

09:39.542 --> 09:43.291
All these gurus used to curse a person,

09:45.333 --> 09:50.500
because they had no compassion, no love, nothing but they had powers

09:50.709 --> 09:55.250
of the right side. But we have seen now

09:56.000 --> 09:58.250
that those people who have right side,

09:58.542 --> 10:01.583
who go only on the right side without the bhakti,

10:02.458 --> 10:08.083
without the blessings of the Divine,

10:10.250 --> 10:12.417
can become rakshasas actually,

10:14.625 --> 10:19.625
can become a great danger for humanity.

10:27.333 --> 10:31.709
This is a very serious thing:

10:33.375 --> 10:38.250
through your intelligence, through your thinking power,

10:38.417 --> 10:41.458
your ego can go to any limit

10:42.375 --> 10:45.333
and create problems within you.

10:46.208 --> 10:49.208
Now the ultimate of this problem is,

10:50.125 --> 10:53.125
we have seen is, are many diseases,

10:53.417 --> 10:56.333
which are absolutely incurable.

10:59.542 --> 11:03.291
Even some people, right-sided, some people,

11:03.667 --> 11:08.417
can get a kind of a cancer called blood cancer.

11:09.667 --> 11:12.625
And this blood cancer, now we have cured it,

11:13.417 --> 11:16.709
but even if it is cured you can go back

11:17.166 --> 11:19.458
to that kind of aggressiveness

11:19.709 --> 11:22.250
thinking that you are very right.

11:23.041 --> 11:26.166
Such people always try to find faults with others,

11:27.542 --> 11:35.000
that such and such person is not good, he’s doing harm,

11:35.291 --> 11:39.208
or any way they can find faults with others, not with themselves.

11:40.041 --> 11:43.375
Their attention is outside, not on themselves.

11:43.667 --> 11:46.208
They never see what’s wrong with them,

11:46.375 --> 11:49.458
but they always see what’s wrong with others.

11:50.041 --> 11:53.250
By doing that, you see, they are climbing the ladder

11:54.041 --> 11:59.458
of a horrible right side, which can give you horrible diseases.

12:00.458 --> 12:03.125
As I’ve told you, first is the blood cancer.

12:04.583 --> 12:09.375
If you get rid of the blood cancer then

12:10.125 --> 12:15.500
you can get into another problems. Nowadays there’s a very famous

12:16.000 --> 12:18.458
disease called Alzheimers.

12:19.709 --> 12:22.458
This is also the side of the right side;

12:23.333 --> 12:27.166
because if you don’t have that bhakti, that humility,

12:28.125 --> 12:32.208
that blessings of the Goddess,

12:33.125 --> 12:37.125
you can develop all such horrible diseases

12:37.542 --> 12:40.166
which are not only fatal,

12:41.041 --> 12:44.041
but also very injurious to others.

12:44.625 --> 12:51.083
So by being right-sided you do not progress.

12:51.709 --> 12:56.083
You can become a big ascetic, they call it,

12:57.166 --> 13:00.583
who can curse others,

13:01.542 --> 13:06.208
who can put them into troubles,

13:08.166 --> 13:11.250
think that that is a great power – it is not!

13:12.709 --> 13:14.709
It is not at all.

13:15.625 --> 13:21.500
Because, though you are not suppressed

13:22.458 --> 13:25.542
by other powers, negative powers,

13:26.709 --> 13:32.125
but your own power takes your life.

13:35.625 --> 13:39.125
So Kundalini, when it is arisen,

13:40.208 --> 13:44.166
the best thing is to go to the left side,

13:46.041 --> 13:51.000
not criticising others, not talking ill of others,

13:51.417 --> 13:54.333
but seeing within you, what’s wrong.

13:56.583 --> 14:01.709
Find out what is the matter with you.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.625
First it starts with self-importance,

14:06.542 --> 14:09.041
that “I am a very important person,”

14:10.041 --> 14:13.166
and with this self-importance you go on

14:13.625 --> 14:17.500
troubling everyone and torturing everyone, and all that.

14:18.125 --> 14:21.041
But because of your right-side movement,

14:22.041 --> 14:24.458
you can become very successful.

14:25.291 --> 14:28.166
Hitler was the climax of that.

14:29.625 --> 14:36.125
And that’s how people start taking to very, very cruel things.

14:38.083 --> 14:43.166
Nowadays, I think that some people are

14:46.000 --> 14:52.041
ruling  everywhere with their right side.

14:54.083 --> 15:01.125
We do not have people who are using their left side.

15:02.458 --> 15:07.375
And whenever they use their left side they are called as saints.

15:09.125 --> 15:12.375
Now you all have the powers of the left side.

15:13.500 --> 15:18.166
Some of you do have little bit right side also, doesn’t matter.

15:22.458 --> 15:26.291
Now I would say that you have achieved

15:26.583 --> 15:29.041
your left side mastery:

15:30.458 --> 15:34.333
Kundalini awakening is there, you are one with the Divine.

15:34.667 --> 15:39.583
Now you can come to the right side and know about right side,

15:42.041 --> 15:46.041
and try to express your right side.

15:47.542 --> 15:52.083
You can express it not by dominating others but dominating yourself.

15:52.583 --> 15:54.542
By self-examination.

15:55.500 --> 16:00.333
By understanding what’s wrong with you. Why do you behave like that?

16:01.125 --> 16:07.333
Why do you trouble others? Why do you overpower others?

16:08.083 --> 16:11.083
Such people will always, I have seen, organise

16:11.291 --> 16:13.542
and arrange, and do this and do that.

16:15.417 --> 16:18.500
Instead of organising themselves they’ll organise others.

16:20.125 --> 16:22.458
These things complicate.

16:25.041 --> 16:29.667
But if you have love and if you have bhakti,

16:30.166 --> 16:33.166
you can very, very easily

16:36.333 --> 16:42.250
dominate  others in a very different manner.

16:44.542 --> 16:51.458
It is not that you dominate by cruelty,

16:53.333 --> 16:59.291
by oppression, but you dominate with your love.

17:01.166 --> 17:03.417
And you don’t want to dominate,

17:04.166 --> 17:07.250
but easily people get very much succumbed

17:08.166 --> 17:14.166
to love and to magnanimity, to generosity.

17:15.375 --> 17:19.333
So all these qualities you must first develop within yourself:

17:20.208 --> 17:25.125
is the left-side problem, that – you should be very peaceful,

17:26.291 --> 17:30.291
you should give love to others, you should be generous,

17:31.125 --> 17:36.166
you should be kind, and see how much it pays.

17:37.709 --> 17:42.583
I’ve seen some people who are extremely rude,

17:44.583 --> 17:48.375
they can be rude to anyone, that’s their nature,

17:49.125 --> 17:52.041
which they should overcome with the left side.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.583
Rudeness is not the sign of a saint.

17:57.208 --> 17:59.500
A saint is extremely peaceful,

18:00.333 --> 18:03.500
and never gets rude with others.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.333
So the introspection should work first of all,

18:08.000 --> 18:11.458
“Where are we wrong? What wrong things we are doing?

18:12.417 --> 18:14.291
What is our style?”

18:15.291 --> 18:19.291
Once you discover that your style is already left-side,

18:19.709 --> 18:22.333
then you should take to right side

18:22.625 --> 18:25.458
and possess the power of right side.

18:33.125 --> 18:36.041
What are the powers of right side now

18:37.291 --> 18:43.125
which are achieved through the left-side perfection?

18:44.417 --> 18:48.375
We have some very great Gurus on this line.

18:49.458 --> 18:53.375
One of them was Raja Janaka.

18:55.542 --> 18:58.041
He was a ruler of a country,

18:58.375 --> 19:04.500
and a very well-known ruler and everything; but still, still,

19:05.500 --> 19:09.166
though He was so generous and good and everything,

19:10.417 --> 19:16.208
but at the same time He was a great monarch,

19:16.458 --> 19:20.542
great king of those days,

19:22.542 --> 19:29.375
very much known for His impartiality,  for His statesmanship

19:30.166 --> 19:35.583
and all kinds of beautiful things He did for His

19:39.625 --> 19:45.041
subjects. That is there, is Raja Janaka.

19:45.208 --> 19:47.583
He could not get disturbed with anything.

19:49.417 --> 19:52.166
And people never understood

19:52.333 --> 19:56.291
why the greatest of greatest saints used to bow to Him.

19:57.208 --> 20:02.458
What was so great? Though He was a king, He was living so lavishly

20:03.291 --> 20:07.041
and He had so many of ornaments and

20:07.375 --> 20:10.250
also conveyances and all that;

20:11.250 --> 20:14.458
because nothing was above Him,

20:15.375 --> 20:17.458
He was so detached with everything.

20:18.291 --> 20:22.125
He had everything, but He was so detached.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.291
That’s a very good example of a person

20:25.625 --> 20:31.041
who had mastered His left, and now who was the king,

20:31.250 --> 20:33.166
Raja Janaka, was there.

20:33.625 --> 20:37.333
Like that we had many people later on also,

20:38.208 --> 20:44.291
one after another, who were extremely, extremely rich,

20:45.125 --> 20:50.625
extremely, I should say, powerful as kings,

20:51.250 --> 20:55.208
but inside they were

20:55.542 --> 21:01.125
absolutely like divine personality.

21:02.709 --> 21:08.125
Nothing disturbed them, nothing made them feel greater or happier.

21:08.500 --> 21:14.250
No position, no power was to them great.

21:15.583 --> 21:22.583
This is a complete emancipation of human beings,

21:23.333 --> 21:27.208
that you are realised soul.

21:28.125 --> 21:34.166
You should be fully equipped with compassion love and understanding.

21:35.083 --> 21:40.333
But at the same time, it should be expressed in the right way.

21:41.458 --> 21:46.166
For example, we can say Christ, He’s another example.

21:47.291 --> 21:51.083
Though He was an Incarnation, still

21:52.041 --> 21:59.417
the amount of forgiveness and love He has for people is tremendous.

22:00.291 --> 22:02.166
But at the same time,

22:02.333 --> 22:07.166
He used to go on the mountains and preach about spirituality.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.166
Those were not very safe times,

22:11.375 --> 22:15.417
because people didn’t like anybody talking like that.

22:16.125 --> 22:19.375
They hated Him because He talked about God.

22:20.417 --> 22:23.291
And what they did to Him you know very well.

22:24.375 --> 22:26.041
Doesn’t matter.

22:26.250 --> 22:29.417
Though they crucified Him, still

22:30.291 --> 22:34.500
we all respect Him as a great personality.

22:35.542 --> 22:41.041
Reason is, He was, He was no doubt an Incarnation,

22:42.542 --> 22:48.125
but still He went all out to give His achievements or

22:48.291 --> 22:51.500
I can say, whatever powers He had, to others.

22:52.500 --> 22:57.041
He went all over the places, He had no facilities,

22:57.291 --> 23:01.125
but still He went out to many people

23:01.250 --> 23:04.333
and tried to save them.

23:05.208 --> 23:07.458
This was the right-side movement.

23:09.041 --> 23:15.166
That means Sahaja Yogis can also become right-sided,but like Christ.

23:16.083 --> 23:18.166
Otherwise if they are right-sided

23:18.458 --> 23:21.333
they’ll organise, they’ll do all kinds of things,

23:21.417 --> 23:23.291
and have problems of the right side.

23:24.125 --> 23:26.458
That’s why I want you to avoid the right side.

23:27.166 --> 23:32.417
But once you are fully a left-sided master of Sahaja Yoga,

23:33.291 --> 23:37.291
then it’s very, very much needed

23:37.500 --> 23:41.041
to be a complete personality of spirituality,

23:41.458 --> 23:44.333
that you should take to right-side movement.

23:44.667 --> 23:48.417
And what is the right-side movement is the collectivity.

23:49.625 --> 23:53.041
Should not be satisfied with what you have got.

23:53.709 --> 23:55.125
It’s very easy

23:55.333 --> 23:59.083
to feel, “Oh, now we have got realisation, now what is there?

23:59.458 --> 24:03.542
We are on top of the world!” That’s not so.

24:04.458 --> 24:08.417
You have to go out, talk to people.

24:09.041 --> 24:11.208
They will insult you, they’ll trouble you,

24:11.417 --> 24:13.125
they’ll do all kinds of things.

24:13.333 --> 24:18.041
But you are already a person, already a realised soul.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.667
You can listen to them, what they are saying;

24:21.291 --> 24:28.000
you will not ask for anything, but you’d like to do good to them.

24:28.583 --> 24:30.709
This is also a compassion,

24:31.417 --> 24:34.417
that you don’t want to keep your realisation to yourself,

24:34.709 --> 24:36.625
but you want to do it

24:37.083 --> 24:40.458
for others also so that they also get realisation,

24:40.709 --> 24:45.208
it’s very important. If you do not feel that way,

24:45.375 --> 24:48.208
the pity for people who haven’t got realisation,

24:48.625 --> 24:51.667
think of the times you were not realised.

24:53.417 --> 24:58.125
These people are also not realised and they are having a bad time,

24:58.333 --> 25:00.583
they can be in for any trouble.

25:01.583 --> 25:05.000
So now, it’s not that if you have got realisation

25:05.166 --> 25:07.667
you settle down with it – no, that’s not the way;

25:08.458 --> 25:11.291
but you should go all out to see

25:12.041 --> 25:15.417
that you give realisation to others, and save them.

25:16.375 --> 25:22.333
You all have got realisation not for your sake,

25:22.709 --> 25:27.375
it’s not limited for you, but it is meant for others,

25:28.583 --> 25:30.583
that you have to give it to others.

25:31.583 --> 25:35.208
And as soon as you’ll start giving it to others you’ll be amazed,

25:36.000 --> 25:40.041
so many qualities in you will come up;

25:43.125 --> 25:48.250
because when you see others, you find

25:49.417 --> 25:51.583
that what is lacking in them,

25:52.375 --> 25:56.458
what do they need, what you have to give,  how you have to give.

25:57.667 --> 26:00.166
You can become anything, you can become a poet,

26:00.333 --> 26:04.583
you can become a writer, you can, anything can you become,

26:05.125 --> 26:07.709
in case you face others.

26:08.583 --> 26:13.041
Then it comes as a reaction within you, all these qualities develop,

26:13.375 --> 26:20.125
and you become a very good, I should say, artist.

26:21.500 --> 26:25.583
This is only possible if you meet other people

26:26.166 --> 26:29.500
and talk to them about Sahaja Yoga,

26:30.250 --> 26:32.709
and tell them about your Self-realisation.

26:33.709 --> 26:37.291
I know there will be problems, I know. That is true.

26:37.583 --> 26:40.333
There will be people who will oppose you, say

26:41.125 --> 26:43.000
all kinds of things against you,

26:43.208 --> 26:46.333
and they’ll try to stop your activities and do

26:46.625 --> 26:49.041
all kinds of harm, doesn’t matter.

26:50.125 --> 26:52.250
But that’s the thing you should achieve,

26:52.542 --> 26:55.291
is to meet people, talk to them

26:55.542 --> 26:59.083
and start telling them about Self-realisation you have to save them.

27:00.333 --> 27:01.709
That’s important.

27:02.125 --> 27:05.667
But first of all you should know that you should have no right-sided

27:06.208 --> 27:10.000
complications, otherwise they’ll all run away.

27:10.333 --> 27:13.166
A person who is spiritual is supposed

27:13.375 --> 27:16.709
or accepted to be a very humble person.

27:17.458 --> 27:21.500
Of course because he is humble, people will take advantage of him,

27:21.625 --> 27:25.208
say all kinds of things, it’s alright, is a part of the game.

27:25.417 --> 27:29.125
But, he doesn’t mind, he doesn’t mind anything.

27:29.417 --> 27:31.709
Anything that comes his way, he doesn’t mind.

27:32.125 --> 27:37.542
But what is the main thing is that he has compassion.

27:38.291 --> 27:44.500
His compassion that he had before from the left side is now expanded

27:45.041 --> 27:47.333
and he wants to save the people.

27:48.166 --> 27:52.291
People don’t have food, is alright, it’s a big complication;

27:52.542 --> 27:55.083
if people are starving is another;

27:55.458 --> 27:59.375
but if they do not get spirituality,

28:00.709 --> 28:02.625
what’s the use of their human life,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.667
why did they evolve to this state?

28:06.417 --> 28:09.000
They are evolved from animal state,

28:10.041 --> 28:14.250
from the worst possible to a human state.

28:14.667 --> 28:17.709
And now if they do not get their realisation,

28:18.291 --> 28:21.500
that means this is worse than starving,

28:22.166 --> 28:24.500
worse than all kinds of poverty,

28:24.709 --> 28:28.250
worse than all kinds of diseases and troubles.

28:29.125 --> 28:35.041
So why not try to give them realisation?

28:36.083 --> 28:39.291
Why not see that you give them realisation?

28:39.625 --> 28:42.333
But first and foremost thing, as I said,

28:42.542 --> 28:45.375
that in the left you should be very strong.

28:46.291 --> 28:49.417
You shouldn’t start doing it because you have got your realisation,

28:49.709 --> 28:51.375
you can give realisation.

28:51.500 --> 28:54.083
So you should not start doing it

28:55.083 --> 28:59.125
unless and until you have strengthened your left side.

29:01.125 --> 29:03.709
Such a person is extremely humble,

29:04.417 --> 29:08.583
extremely straight, doesn’t grudge about anything,

29:09.125 --> 29:11.208
doesn’t grumble about anything,

29:11.458 --> 29:15.125
and can adjust itself into any circumstance.

29:15.709 --> 29:18.083
It is not attached to anything.

29:19.166 --> 29:22.125
It’s an automatic detachment, it doesn’t have to detach.

29:22.625 --> 29:25.208
You may do anything for that person,

29:25.375 --> 29:29.417
you may try to get anything for that person, it’s alright.

29:30.625 --> 29:33.250
That person will accept, no doubt,

29:33.583 --> 29:36.208
but without any attachment to anything.

29:36.667 --> 29:41.709
Such a detached person is the one who can work it out,

29:42.417 --> 29:45.166
all kinds of propagation of Sahaja Yoga.

29:46.083 --> 29:48.625
Today that is the greatest need of the world,

29:49.333 --> 29:52.125
that we have to have more Sahaja Yogis.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.667
Now, people are so shy to do that,

29:56.417 --> 29:58.125
it’s very surprising.

29:58.291 --> 30:01.166
But I have seen people who don’t have any truth,

30:01.583 --> 30:04.083
who have all kinds of bad gurus,

30:05.125 --> 30:11.375
get after others, try to spread their false ideas.

30:11.709 --> 30:14.000
But Sahaja Yogis, why should they feel,

30:14.166 --> 30:17.041
why should they feel shy, I don’t understand.

30:17.417 --> 30:23.041
So, talk about this to everyone, bring them to Sahaja Yoga.

30:23.500 --> 30:28.083
Is a very important day, because as a Guru puja,

30:28.458 --> 30:33.709
they say that a guru cannot give anything to you.

30:35.166 --> 30:37.458
But I can give you the advice,

30:38.166 --> 30:41.083
and the advice that you enlarge your heart,

30:41.667 --> 30:49.542
you become humble, and try to spread Sahaja Yoga

30:50.375 --> 30:53.709
with humility, not with aggressiveness.

30:54.125 --> 30:56.417
That is extremely important.

30:57.500 --> 31:01.542
If you can do that, then you’ll do full justice

31:03.250 --> 31:06.667
to this life,  which is a spiritual life.

31:07.709 --> 31:11.250
Without that you cannot achieve, you cannot achieve,

31:11.625 --> 31:14.125
the strength of spirituality.

31:15.375 --> 31:20.375
For that you haveto understand that it’s very, very important

31:21.250 --> 31:29.208
that you should give Sahaja Yoga a full chance,through your wisdom.

31:30.417 --> 31:32.709
What I receive [is] mostly the letters are

31:33.208 --> 31:36.709
that this person is troublesome, that person is troublesome,

31:37.208 --> 31:40.375
that person is doing like that. Forget it!

31:41.709 --> 31:45.500
All such persons are not important for Sahaja Yoga.

31:47.250 --> 31:51.125
But if you start on proper lines you will be amazed,

31:51.417 --> 31:56.083
you’ll meet so many people who want peace of mind,

31:56.333 --> 32:03.333
peace of heart and a complete oneness with the Divine.

32:04.375 --> 32:06.625
They may not accept, they may not say,

32:07.208 --> 32:10.458
they might have gone to the wrong people also, possibly.

32:11.542 --> 32:13.667
But despite everything,

32:14.125 --> 32:19.667
they would like to have a real spiritual peace within themselves.

32:20.583 --> 32:24.542
Is a very common desire nowadays among people,

32:25.542 --> 32:28.458
but to approach that and to reach that,

32:29.125 --> 32:33.417
you have to take to a life of a very simple personality.

32:35.709 --> 32:40.458
You see, if you are so much interested in money,

32:42.041 --> 32:47.000
or if you are so much interested in your so-called powers

32:47.417 --> 32:53.667
or in your ambitions, then Sahaja Yoga cannot do anything.

32:54.417 --> 32:57.166
But if you are interested in your compassion

32:57.625 --> 33:01.667
and understanding about today’s world,

33:02.041 --> 33:05.375
how it is in a turmoil: why?

33:05.583 --> 33:09.500
Because of the human beings being in the wrong.

33:10.542 --> 33:16.166
What we have to do is to pass them the knowledge of the Divine.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.500
That should be your desire,

33:19.083 --> 33:23.417
and that is what you’ll feel very much comfortable with.

33:25.667 --> 33:30.000
All other desires, all other wants are,

33:30.625 --> 33:33.125
as you say, it’s very transitory.

33:34.500 --> 33:38.500
One desire is to spread Sahaja Yoga,

33:39.041 --> 33:43.166
is so beautiful that you go on working on it,

33:43.375 --> 33:46.000
and every time you do that,

33:46.250 --> 33:48.667
you will be so joyous and happy,

33:49.542 --> 33:52.041
you’ll have no problems of any kind.

33:52.542 --> 33:56.458
That’s the sign of greatness of Sahaja Yoga,

33:57.166 --> 34:00.333
and I want you all to become like that.

34:01.375 --> 34:04.458
As today’s day is great, because

34:04.667 --> 34:09.500
we are thinking of all the great saints who came on this earth

34:10.166 --> 34:12.542
and who tried to lead us.  What they did,

34:12.709 --> 34:16.709
all of them tried to spread the truth all over the world.

34:17.625 --> 34:22.125
They suffered a lot, they had problems, so many problems,

34:22.542 --> 34:29.166
but they worked very hard in every way to spread Sahaja Yoga

34:29.417 --> 34:32.500
and talk about God anddivinity.

34:33.333 --> 34:36.667
All that is what today you have to give Me,

34:37.208 --> 34:41.709
a promise, that whenever you get any other human being,

34:42.291 --> 34:44.333
you can tell them about Sahaja Yoga.

34:47.500 --> 34:52.417
Not that it’s important but it’s absolutely

34:53.083 --> 34:55.417
immediate need of the world.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.500
If you understand this point,

34:58.709 --> 35:02.667
that at this time, why are you in this world

35:03.291 --> 35:05.458
and what is the need of the world,

35:05.709 --> 35:09.291
you will immediately start feeling the responsibility.

35:10.166 --> 35:13.166
Whether you are a man or a woman is not important.

35:13.583 --> 35:17.583
Go all out to preach, think,

35:18.625 --> 35:22.166
make people understand about Sahaja  Yoga

35:22.542 --> 35:24.583
in every way that is possible,

35:25.291 --> 35:28.709
and I think, then, you will become complete as gurus.

35:29.583 --> 35:33.250
If Sahaja Yoga is just with you, you cannot be a guru.

35:33.709 --> 35:37.041
‘Guru’ also doesn’t mean that you go on preaching about Sahaja Yoga

35:37.208 --> 35:40.625
talking about Sahaja Yoga, giving lectures about Sahaja Yoga, no!

35:41.458 --> 35:45.667
It means the one who gives realisations to others.

35:47.709 --> 35:53.125
How many people you give realisation is the thing,

35:53.250 --> 35:57.667
not to be counted,  but to be felt within like the ripples,

35:58.625 --> 36:02.709
waves of the Ocean of Love in your heart.

36:03.542 --> 36:08.667
So beautiful it is to see that people get realisation

36:09.250 --> 36:13.333
and are immersed in the joy of spirituality.

36:14.500 --> 36:19.583
That’s what I want you to do. That’s why I am on this earth.

36:20.166 --> 36:23.291
I had to suffer also quite a lot, doesn’t matter:

36:23.458 --> 36:26.542
so-called sufferings, I was watching it just like a drama.

36:27.333 --> 36:28.709
So it’s ok.

36:30.041 --> 36:32.166
As long as you do not pay much attention

36:32.291 --> 36:34.625
to all these sufferings, what is so great?

36:35.417 --> 36:42.041
Now you have seen yesterday a beautiful drama about Mohammad Sahib.

36:42.709 --> 36:47.542
I always used to think,  and it was such pain, about Him,  that

36:47.709 --> 36:51.583
how people have misunderstood and have gone astray:

36:52.333 --> 36:55.125
why they are doing all wrong things? Now,

36:55.709 --> 37:00.375
I feel happy that at least you people have realised His greatness,

37:00.667 --> 37:04.417
and have understood and made such a beautiful drama out of it.

37:05.250 --> 37:08.709
I don’t know how far we can propagate this,

37:09.166 --> 37:13.417
but it’s a fact that Mohammad Sahib Himself

37:15.500 --> 37:23.458
was finished, then also His daughter, grand-children were finished,

37:25.166 --> 37:27.083
His son-in-law was finished.

37:28.333 --> 37:30.291
And after that, by finishing them,

37:30.458 --> 37:34.375
they started another horrible thing called Sunnis.

37:35.333 --> 37:40.125
Now, the Sunnah religion is not near the truth at all,

37:40.333 --> 37:46.208
it’s some sort of a very aggressive and a very cruel religion,

37:47.333 --> 37:50.166
and that started spreading everywhere.

37:51.166 --> 37:56.375
In the real Islam religion of Mohammed Sahib was not there.

37:57.583 --> 38:01.500
Those people who killed Him started becoming ‘Islamic’.

38:04.291 --> 38:07.625
So this is also a very wrong thing,

38:08.041 --> 38:13.542
that a man who was so great and so much of spirituality

38:14.500 --> 38:16.625
was not just accepted,

38:17.250 --> 38:20.458
and somebody who killed Him is now accepted.

38:21.417 --> 38:23.417
It can happen in anything.

38:23.709 --> 38:26.667
But the worst it has happened in is Islamic world,

38:27.166 --> 38:31.500
which is very dangerous, and that’s we see

38:31.709 --> 38:35.166
that, in the name of God, how many bad things they are doing.

38:39.125 --> 38:41.667
So, try to understand

38:42.333 --> 38:47.709
that it is not the fate of Mohammad Sahib it has happened,

38:48.625 --> 38:51.667
it’s not the fate of reality it has happened,

38:52.375 --> 38:55.625
but it’s an eye-opener for all of us to see

38:56.333 --> 39:03.333
that the Truth is always challenged by untruth.

39:04.375 --> 39:07.500
And we should stand by the Truth, whatever may happen.

39:09.041 --> 39:12.125
And a day will come when people will realise

39:12.333 --> 39:15.041
that this was a wrong thing they were being,

39:15.500 --> 39:17.417
all the time been following,

39:18.208 --> 39:21.625
and have been doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

39:22.458 --> 39:27.125
All this will work out I am sure, very soon,

39:28.667 --> 39:33.291
if My desire is that powerful, I’m sure

39:33.542 --> 39:38.667
that they will realise that to be kind to be nice to be compassionate

39:39.583 --> 39:45.083
is the best way to feel happy, nothing more than that.

39:46.083 --> 39:49.041
May God bless you.
