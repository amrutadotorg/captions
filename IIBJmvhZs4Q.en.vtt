00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:46.500
In India they were all waiting for the monsoons

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.709
and they are so worried

00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:54.333
because the rain did not come.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.375
So, I was giving bandhan to the rain and it came here

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.208
And now also they have  told,

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:21.333
on the television, that it is going to rain in India.

00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:24.458
But first in Italy!

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:34.667
I was told that in Italy you needed rain very much

00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:38.500
and the first rain you had,

00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:46.375
few days back, and now this the second one.

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:56.250
Because all the understanding

00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:06.125
of the problems of our farmers is there.

00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:12.125
And the rain, you see, is so kind

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:20.375
that it works at the right time.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.667
I am surprised

00:02:25.041 --> 00:02:32.000
at the quick behaviour and obedience of the rain.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.542
Today is a great day, for all of us,  because

00:02:41.208 --> 00:02:45.458
we are celebrating the Guru Puja

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:49.291
and remembering all the great Gurus

00:02:50.583 --> 00:02:56.542
who came on this earth to teach the world about the truth.

00:02:58.417 --> 00:03:01.375
So many of them were [there].

00:03:02.458 --> 00:03:04.583
And they tried their level best

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:09.542
to explain to humanity what is spirituality.

00:03:11.041 --> 00:03:17.041
But it’s such a disparity that people never understood

00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:22.000
that spirituality is the most important thing we need.

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:26.291
That we have to be one with the Divine Power.

00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:31.041
All their endeavours have been in the wrong direction.

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:40.333
First of course they were very intelligent, more than animals,

00:03:41.041 --> 00:03:47.375
and started seeking, not the truth,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.375
but some sort of a self

00:03:52.208 --> 00:03:55.417
-emancipation I should say, I don’t know  what to say, call it –

00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:58.417
self-progress.

00:03:59.542 --> 00:04:04.333
And in that they lost that they have to first seek spirituality,

00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:07.500
which is the most important thing.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.208
But, we had two types of journeys:

00:04:20.041 --> 00:04:28.083
one is through the left side or another through the right side.

00:04:30.208 --> 00:04:33.125
In India, I don’t know why,

00:04:33.542 --> 00:04:39.542
we had lots of people who went into the jungles and became saints

00:04:40.667 --> 00:04:44.458
but they were doing right side tapasya.

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:51.417
That is, going into the five elements

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:57.417
one after another; and mastering the five elements.

00:04:58.458 --> 00:05:03.333
Of course there is truth in it, no doubt.

00:05:04.417 --> 00:05:07.542
You have seen how a candle

00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:19.625
how a candle tells you as to what is your position inside:

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.125
if you are possessed or if you are not,

00:05:24.417 --> 00:05:27.291
a candle can tell you – can you imagine?

00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:33.291
Candle is so much knowledgable.

00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:41.583
Supposing you have a heart, heart trouble –

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:44.208
the candle will show.

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:52.709
And if you treat yourself with a candle, you can cure yourself.

00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:59.291
So, it is so sensitive

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:03.667
not that it can cure, but also so competent,

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.417
not that it shows you that you are sick and you have problems

00:06:08.583 --> 00:06:11.375
but that it is competent to cure you.

00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:20.250
Thats why, in India, Agni was worshipped,

00:06:21.125 --> 00:06:27.166
this  light was worshipped,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.250
the fire was worshipped, that was worshipped first.

00:06:33.208 --> 00:06:39.166
They must have discovered that the fire knows everything,

00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:48.291
so the inner, inner awareness of all these elements,

00:06:49.625 --> 00:06:55.500
they knew about it and thats why they worshipped those elements.

00:06:56.709 --> 00:07:04.375
So before the Puja they used to call all the Deities who belonged

00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:10.583
to those elements to witness their Puja.

00:07:12.625 --> 00:07:15.625
But that turned out to be right sided movement.

00:07:19.542 --> 00:07:24.583
Without the left side right side is very dangerous.

00:07:27.667 --> 00:07:32.333
If you don’t have right side of course

00:07:33.125 --> 00:07:38.208
it’s a big dangerous thing also. But first you must have

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:42.333
development of your left side.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.583
That is what, to begin with, we had in Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:56.500
Left side is compassion, is love, universal feeling,

00:07:58.333 --> 00:08:03.250
or we can say it’s the blessings of the Devi

00:08:04.041 --> 00:08:08.375
which are described you know it, in the Devi Mahatmyam,

00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:14.250
that the Goddess resides within you as so many things.

00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:19.417
She resides within you as shraddha.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:24.375
as, She resides in you as sleep,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.542
She resides in you as illusion, bhranti.

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:33.375
All kinds of things are there on the left-hand side,

00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:36.625
which are already described.

00:08:37.458 --> 00:08:42.041
And when I told you about Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:42.458 --> 00:08:46.291
I wanted to make your left side very strong.

00:08:47.625 --> 00:08:51.333
Those who, people who, took to right side

00:08:51.667 --> 00:08:56.542
became very aggressive people, and they had mastered

00:08:57.083 --> 00:09:01.250
the essence of these five elements, that’s alright. But

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:05.375
they were extremely hot-tempered,

00:09:06.333 --> 00:09:11.458
so much so that they used to curse people, curse them.

00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:17.291
They used to say things which were not kind;

00:09:18.208 --> 00:09:21.125
and they didn’t believe in the universality.

00:09:22.542 --> 00:09:27.583
It was such a dangerous thing that they took.

00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:33.291
In Indian shastras you can see many incidents

00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:38.709
where people gave a curse, sharp, very common.

00:09:39.542 --> 00:09:43.291
All these gurus used to curse a person,

00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:50.500
because they had no compassion, no love, nothing but they had powers

00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:55.250
of the right side. But we have seen now

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.250
that those people who have right side,

00:09:58.542 --> 00:10:01.583
who go only on the right side without the bhakti,

00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:08.083
without the blessings of the Divine,

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.417
can become rakshasas actually,

00:10:14.625 --> 00:10:19.625
can become a great danger for humanity.

00:10:27.333 --> 00:10:31.709
This is a very serious thing:

00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:38.250
through your intelligence, through your thinking power,

00:10:38.417 --> 00:10:41.458
your ego can go to any limit

00:10:42.375 --> 00:10:45.333
and create problems within you.

00:10:46.208 --> 00:10:49.208
Now the ultimate of this problem is,

00:10:50.125 --> 00:10:53.125
we have seen is, are many diseases,

00:10:53.417 --> 00:10:56.333
which are absolutely incurable.

00:10:59.542 --> 00:11:03.291
Even some people, right-sided, some people,

00:11:03.667 --> 00:11:08.417
can get a kind of a cancer called blood cancer.

00:11:09.667 --> 00:11:12.625
And this blood cancer, now we have cured it,

00:11:13.417 --> 00:11:16.709
but even if it is cured you can go back

00:11:17.166 --> 00:11:19.458
to that kind of aggressiveness

00:11:19.709 --> 00:11:22.250
thinking that you are very right.

00:11:23.041 --> 00:11:26.166
Such people always try to find faults with others,

00:11:27.542 --> 00:11:35.000
that such and such person is not good, he’s doing harm,

00:11:35.291 --> 00:11:39.208
or any way they can find faults with others, not with themselves.

00:11:40.041 --> 00:11:43.375
Their attention is outside, not on themselves.

00:11:43.667 --> 00:11:46.208
They never see what’s wrong with them,

00:11:46.375 --> 00:11:49.458
but they always see what’s wrong with others.

00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:53.250
By doing that, you see, they are climbing the ladder

00:11:54.041 --> 00:11:59.458
of a horrible right side, which can give you horrible diseases.

00:12:00.458 --> 00:12:03.125
As I’ve told you, first is the blood cancer.

00:12:04.583 --> 00:12:09.375
If you get rid of the blood cancer then

00:12:10.125 --> 00:12:15.500
you can get into another problems. Nowadays there’s a very famous

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.458
disease called Alzheimers.

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:22.458
This is also the side of the right side;

00:12:23.333 --> 00:12:27.166
because if you don’t have that bhakti, that humility,

00:12:28.125 --> 00:12:32.208
that blessings of the Goddess,

00:12:33.125 --> 00:12:37.125
you can develop all such horrible diseases

00:12:37.542 --> 00:12:40.166
which are not only fatal,

00:12:41.041 --> 00:12:44.041
but also very injurious to others.

00:12:44.625 --> 00:12:51.083
So by being right-sided you do not progress.

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:56.083
You can become a big ascetic, they call it,

00:12:57.166 --> 00:13:00.583
who can curse others,

00:13:01.542 --> 00:13:06.208
who can put them into troubles,

00:13:08.166 --> 00:13:11.250
think that that is a great power – it is not!

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:14.709
It is not at all.

00:13:15.625 --> 00:13:21.500
Because, though you are not suppressed

00:13:22.458 --> 00:13:25.542
by other powers, negative powers,

00:13:26.709 --> 00:13:32.125
but your own power takes your life.

00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:39.125
So Kundalini, when it is arisen,

00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:44.166
the best thing is to go to the left side,

00:13:46.041 --> 00:13:51.000
not criticising others, not talking ill of others,

00:13:51.417 --> 00:13:54.333
but seeing within you, what’s wrong.

00:13:56.583 --> 00:14:01.709
Find out what is the matter with you.

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:05.625
First it starts with self-importance,

00:14:06.542 --> 00:14:09.041
that “I am a very important person,”

00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:13.166
and with this self-importance you go on

00:14:13.625 --> 00:14:17.500
troubling everyone and torturing everyone, and all that.

00:14:18.125 --> 00:14:21.041
But because of your right-side movement,

00:14:22.041 --> 00:14:24.458
you can become very successful.

00:14:25.291 --> 00:14:28.166
Hitler was the climax of that.

00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:36.125
And that’s how people start taking to very, very cruel things.

00:14:38.083 --> 00:14:43.166
Nowadays, I think that some people are

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.041
ruling  everywhere with their right side.

00:14:54.083 --> 00:15:01.125
We do not have people who are using their left side.

00:15:02.458 --> 00:15:07.375
And whenever they use their left side they are called as saints.

00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:12.375
Now you all have the powers of the left side.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:18.166
Some of you do have little bit right side also, doesn’t matter.

00:15:22.458 --> 00:15:26.291
Now I would say that you have achieved

00:15:26.583 --> 00:15:29.041
your left side mastery:

00:15:30.458 --> 00:15:34.333
Kundalini awakening is there, you are one with the Divine.

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:39.583
Now you can come to the right side and know about right side,

00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:46.041
and try to express your right side.

00:15:47.542 --> 00:15:52.083
You can express it not by dominating others but dominating yourself.

00:15:52.583 --> 00:15:54.542
By self-examination.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:00.333
By understanding what’s wrong with you. Why do you behave like that?

00:16:01.125 --> 00:16:07.333
Why do you trouble others? Why do you overpower others?

00:16:08.083 --> 00:16:11.083
Such people will always, I have seen, organise

00:16:11.291 --> 00:16:13.542
and arrange, and do this and do that.

00:16:15.417 --> 00:16:18.500
Instead of organising themselves they’ll organise others.

00:16:20.125 --> 00:16:22.458
These things complicate.

00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:29.667
But if you have love and if you have bhakti,

00:16:30.166 --> 00:16:33.166
you can very, very easily

00:16:36.333 --> 00:16:42.250
dominate  others in a very different manner.

00:16:44.542 --> 00:16:51.458
It is not that you dominate by cruelty,

00:16:53.333 --> 00:16:59.291
by oppression, but you dominate with your love.

00:17:01.166 --> 00:17:03.417
And you don’t want to dominate,

00:17:04.166 --> 00:17:07.250
but easily people get very much succumbed

00:17:08.166 --> 00:17:14.166
to love and to magnanimity, to generosity.

00:17:15.375 --> 00:17:19.333
So all these qualities you must first develop within yourself:

00:17:20.208 --> 00:17:25.125
is the left-side problem, that – you should be very peaceful,

00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:30.291
you should give love to others, you should be generous,

00:17:31.125 --> 00:17:36.166
you should be kind, and see how much it pays.

00:17:37.709 --> 00:17:42.583
I’ve seen some people who are extremely rude,

00:17:44.583 --> 00:17:48.375
they can be rude to anyone, that’s their nature,

00:17:49.125 --> 00:17:52.041
which they should overcome with the left side.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.583
Rudeness is not the sign of a saint.

00:17:57.208 --> 00:17:59.500
A saint is extremely peaceful,

00:18:00.333 --> 00:18:03.500
and never gets rude with others.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.333
So the introspection should work first of all,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.458
“Where are we wrong? What wrong things we are doing?

00:18:12.417 --> 00:18:14.291
What is our style?”

00:18:15.291 --> 00:18:19.291
Once you discover that your style is already left-side,

00:18:19.709 --> 00:18:22.333
then you should take to right side

00:18:22.625 --> 00:18:25.458
and possess the power of right side.

00:18:33.125 --> 00:18:36.041
What are the powers of right side now

00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:43.125
which are achieved through the left-side perfection?

00:18:44.417 --> 00:18:48.375
We have some very great Gurus on this line.

00:18:49.458 --> 00:18:53.375
One of them was Raja Janaka.

00:18:55.542 --> 00:18:58.041
He was a ruler of a country,

00:18:58.375 --> 00:19:04.500
and a very well-known ruler and everything; but still, still,

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:09.166
though He was so generous and good and everything,

00:19:10.417 --> 00:19:16.208
but at the same time He was a great monarch,

00:19:16.458 --> 00:19:20.542
great king of those days,

00:19:22.542 --> 00:19:29.375
very much known for His impartiality,  for His statesmanship

00:19:30.166 --> 00:19:35.583
and all kinds of beautiful things He did for His

00:19:39.625 --> 00:19:45.041
subjects. That is there, is Raja Janaka.

00:19:45.208 --> 00:19:47.583
He could not get disturbed with anything.

00:19:49.417 --> 00:19:52.166
And people never understood

00:19:52.333 --> 00:19:56.291
why the greatest of greatest saints used to bow to Him.

00:19:57.208 --> 00:20:02.458
What was so great? Though He was a king, He was living so lavishly

00:20:03.291 --> 00:20:07.041
and He had so many of ornaments and

00:20:07.375 --> 00:20:10.250
also conveyances and all that;

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:14.458
because nothing was above Him,

00:20:15.375 --> 00:20:17.458
He was so detached with everything.

00:20:18.291 --> 00:20:22.125
He had everything, but He was so detached.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.291
That’s a very good example of a person

00:20:25.625 --> 00:20:31.041
who had mastered His left, and now who was the king,

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:33.166
Raja Janaka, was there.

00:20:33.625 --> 00:20:37.333
Like that we had many people later on also,

00:20:38.208 --> 00:20:44.291
one after another, who were extremely, extremely rich,

00:20:45.125 --> 00:20:50.625
extremely, I should say, powerful as kings,

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.208
but inside they were

00:20:55.542 --> 00:21:01.125
absolutely like divine personality.

00:21:02.709 --> 00:21:08.125
Nothing disturbed them, nothing made them feel greater or happier.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:14.250
No position, no power was to them great.

00:21:15.583 --> 00:21:22.583
This is a complete emancipation of human beings,

00:21:23.333 --> 00:21:27.208
that you are realised soul.

00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:34.166
You should be fully equipped with compassion love and understanding.

00:21:35.083 --> 00:21:40.333
But at the same time, it should be expressed in the right way.

00:21:41.458 --> 00:21:46.166
For example, we can say Christ, He’s another example.

00:21:47.291 --> 00:21:51.083
Though He was an Incarnation, still

00:21:52.041 --> 00:21:59.417
the amount of forgiveness and love He has for people is tremendous.

00:22:00.291 --> 00:22:02.166
But at the same time,

00:22:02.333 --> 00:22:07.166
He used to go on the mountains and preach about spirituality.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.166
Those were not very safe times,

00:22:11.375 --> 00:22:15.417
because people didn’t like anybody talking like that.

00:22:16.125 --> 00:22:19.375
They hated Him because He talked about God.

00:22:20.417 --> 00:22:23.291
And what they did to Him you know very well.

00:22:24.375 --> 00:22:26.041
Doesn’t matter.

00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:29.417
Though they crucified Him, still

00:22:30.291 --> 00:22:34.500
we all respect Him as a great personality.

00:22:35.542 --> 00:22:41.041
Reason is, He was, He was no doubt an Incarnation,

00:22:42.542 --> 00:22:48.125
but still He went all out to give His achievements or

00:22:48.291 --> 00:22:51.500
I can say, whatever powers He had, to others.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.041
He went all over the places, He had no facilities,

00:22:57.291 --> 00:23:01.125
but still He went out to many people

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:04.333
and tried to save them.

00:23:05.208 --> 00:23:07.458
This was the right-side movement.

00:23:09.041 --> 00:23:15.166
That means Sahaja Yogis can also become right-sided,but like Christ.

00:23:16.083 --> 00:23:18.166
Otherwise if they are right-sided

00:23:18.458 --> 00:23:21.333
they’ll organise, they’ll do all kinds of things,

00:23:21.417 --> 00:23:23.291
and have problems of the right side.

00:23:24.125 --> 00:23:26.458
That’s why I want you to avoid the right side.

00:23:27.166 --> 00:23:32.417
But once you are fully a left-sided master of Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:33.291 --> 00:23:37.291
then it’s very, very much needed

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:41.041
to be a complete personality of spirituality,

00:23:41.458 --> 00:23:44.333
that you should take to right-side movement.

00:23:44.667 --> 00:23:48.417
And what is the right-side movement is the collectivity.

00:23:49.625 --> 00:23:53.041
Should not be satisfied with what you have got.

00:23:53.709 --> 00:23:55.125
It’s very easy

00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:59.083
to feel, “Oh, now we have got realisation, now what is there?

00:23:59.458 --> 00:24:03.542
We are on top of the world!” That’s not so.

00:24:04.458 --> 00:24:08.417
You have to go out, talk to people.

00:24:09.041 --> 00:24:11.208
They will insult you, they’ll trouble you,

00:24:11.417 --> 00:24:13.125
they’ll do all kinds of things.

00:24:13.333 --> 00:24:18.041
But you are already a person, already a realised soul.

00:24:18.458 --> 00:24:20.667
You can listen to them, what they are saying;

00:24:21.291 --> 00:24:28.000
you will not ask for anything, but you’d like to do good to them.

00:24:28.583 --> 00:24:30.709
This is also a compassion,

00:24:31.417 --> 00:24:34.417
that you don’t want to keep your realisation to yourself,

00:24:34.709 --> 00:24:36.625
but you want to do it

00:24:37.083 --> 00:24:40.458
for others also so that they also get realisation,

00:24:40.709 --> 00:24:45.208
it’s very important. If you do not feel that way,

00:24:45.375 --> 00:24:48.208
the pity for people who haven’t got realisation,

00:24:48.625 --> 00:24:51.667
think of the times you were not realised.

00:24:53.417 --> 00:24:58.125
These people are also not realised and they are having a bad time,

00:24:58.333 --> 00:25:00.583
they can be in for any trouble.

00:25:01.583 --> 00:25:05.000
So now, it’s not that if you have got realisation

00:25:05.166 --> 00:25:07.667
you settle down with it – no, that’s not the way;

00:25:08.458 --> 00:25:11.291
but you should go all out to see

00:25:12.041 --> 00:25:15.417
that you give realisation to others, and save them.

00:25:16.375 --> 00:25:22.333
You all have got realisation not for your sake,

00:25:22.709 --> 00:25:27.375
it’s not limited for you, but it is meant for others,

00:25:28.583 --> 00:25:30.583
that you have to give it to others.

00:25:31.583 --> 00:25:35.208
And as soon as you’ll start giving it to others you’ll be amazed,

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.041
so many qualities in you will come up;

00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:48.250
because when you see others, you find

00:25:49.417 --> 00:25:51.583
that what is lacking in them,

00:25:52.375 --> 00:25:56.458
what do they need, what you have to give,  how you have to give.

00:25:57.667 --> 00:26:00.166
You can become anything, you can become a poet,

00:26:00.333 --> 00:26:04.583
you can become a writer, you can, anything can you become,

00:26:05.125 --> 00:26:07.709
in case you face others.

00:26:08.583 --> 00:26:13.041
Then it comes as a reaction within you, all these qualities develop,

00:26:13.375 --> 00:26:20.125
and you become a very good, I should say, artist.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.583
This is only possible if you meet other people

00:26:26.166 --> 00:26:29.500
and talk to them about Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:32.709
and tell them about your Self-realisation.

00:26:33.709 --> 00:26:37.291
I know there will be problems, I know. That is true.

00:26:37.583 --> 00:26:40.333
There will be people who will oppose you, say

00:26:41.125 --> 00:26:43.000
all kinds of things against you,

00:26:43.208 --> 00:26:46.333
and they’ll try to stop your activities and do

00:26:46.625 --> 00:26:49.041
all kinds of harm, doesn’t matter.

00:26:50.125 --> 00:26:52.250
But that’s the thing you should achieve,

00:26:52.542 --> 00:26:55.291
is to meet people, talk to them

00:26:55.542 --> 00:26:59.083
and start telling them about Self-realisation you have to save them.

00:27:00.333 --> 00:27:01.709
That’s important.

00:27:02.125 --> 00:27:05.667
But first of all you should know that you should have no right-sided

00:27:06.208 --> 00:27:10.000
complications, otherwise they’ll all run away.

00:27:10.333 --> 00:27:13.166
A person who is spiritual is supposed

00:27:13.375 --> 00:27:16.709
or accepted to be a very humble person.

00:27:17.458 --> 00:27:21.500
Of course because he is humble, people will take advantage of him,

00:27:21.625 --> 00:27:25.208
say all kinds of things, it’s alright, is a part of the game.

00:27:25.417 --> 00:27:29.125
But, he doesn’t mind, he doesn’t mind anything.

00:27:29.417 --> 00:27:31.709
Anything that comes his way, he doesn’t mind.

00:27:32.125 --> 00:27:37.542
But what is the main thing is that he has compassion.

00:27:38.291 --> 00:27:44.500
His compassion that he had before from the left side is now expanded

00:27:45.041 --> 00:27:47.333
and he wants to save the people.

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:52.291
People don’t have food, is alright, it’s a big complication;

00:27:52.542 --> 00:27:55.083
if people are starving is another;

00:27:55.458 --> 00:27:59.375
but if they do not get spirituality,

00:28:00.709 --> 00:28:02.625
what’s the use of their human life,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.667
why did they evolve to this state?

00:28:06.417 --> 00:28:09.000
They are evolved from animal state,

00:28:10.041 --> 00:28:14.250
from the worst possible to a human state.

00:28:14.667 --> 00:28:17.709
And now if they do not get their realisation,

00:28:18.291 --> 00:28:21.500
that means this is worse than starving,

00:28:22.166 --> 00:28:24.500
worse than all kinds of poverty,

00:28:24.709 --> 00:28:28.250
worse than all kinds of diseases and troubles.

00:28:29.125 --> 00:28:35.041
So why not try to give them realisation?

00:28:36.083 --> 00:28:39.291
Why not see that you give them realisation?

00:28:39.625 --> 00:28:42.333
But first and foremost thing, as I said,

00:28:42.542 --> 00:28:45.375
that in the left you should be very strong.

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:49.417
You shouldn’t start doing it because you have got your realisation,

00:28:49.709 --> 00:28:51.375
you can give realisation.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.083
So you should not start doing it

00:28:55.083 --> 00:28:59.125
unless and until you have strengthened your left side.

00:29:01.125 --> 00:29:03.709
Such a person is extremely humble,

00:29:04.417 --> 00:29:08.583
extremely straight, doesn’t grudge about anything,

00:29:09.125 --> 00:29:11.208
doesn’t grumble about anything,

00:29:11.458 --> 00:29:15.125
and can adjust itself into any circumstance.

00:29:15.709 --> 00:29:18.083
It is not attached to anything.

00:29:19.166 --> 00:29:22.125
It’s an automatic detachment, it doesn’t have to detach.

00:29:22.625 --> 00:29:25.208
You may do anything for that person,

00:29:25.375 --> 00:29:29.417
you may try to get anything for that person, it’s alright.

00:29:30.625 --> 00:29:33.250
That person will accept, no doubt,

00:29:33.583 --> 00:29:36.208
but without any attachment to anything.

00:29:36.667 --> 00:29:41.709
Such a detached person is the one who can work it out,

00:29:42.417 --> 00:29:45.166
all kinds of propagation of Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:46.083 --> 00:29:48.625
Today that is the greatest need of the world,

00:29:49.333 --> 00:29:52.125
that we have to have more Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:55.667
Now, people are so shy to do that,

00:29:56.417 --> 00:29:58.125
it’s very surprising.

00:29:58.291 --> 00:30:01.166
But I have seen people who don’t have any truth,

00:30:01.583 --> 00:30:04.083
who have all kinds of bad gurus,

00:30:05.125 --> 00:30:11.375
get after others, try to spread their false ideas.

00:30:11.709 --> 00:30:14.000
But Sahaja Yogis, why should they feel,

00:30:14.166 --> 00:30:17.041
why should they feel shy, I don’t understand.

00:30:17.417 --> 00:30:23.041
So, talk about this to everyone, bring them to Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:28.083
Is a very important day, because as a Guru puja,

00:30:28.458 --> 00:30:33.709
they say that a guru cannot give anything to you.

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:37.458
But I can give you the advice,

00:30:38.166 --> 00:30:41.083
and the advice that you enlarge your heart,

00:30:41.667 --> 00:30:49.542
you become humble, and try to spread Sahaja Yoga

00:30:50.375 --> 00:30:53.709
with humility, not with aggressiveness.

00:30:54.125 --> 00:30:56.417
That is extremely important.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:01.542
If you can do that, then you’ll do full justice

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:06.667
to this life,  which is a spiritual life.

00:31:07.709 --> 00:31:11.250
Without that you cannot achieve, you cannot achieve,

00:31:11.625 --> 00:31:14.125
the strength of spirituality.

00:31:15.375 --> 00:31:20.375
For that you haveto understand that it’s very, very important

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:29.208
that you should give Sahaja Yoga a full chance,through your wisdom.

00:31:30.417 --> 00:31:32.709
What I receive [is] mostly the letters are

00:31:33.208 --> 00:31:36.709
that this person is troublesome, that person is troublesome,

00:31:37.208 --> 00:31:40.375
that person is doing like that. Forget it!

00:31:41.709 --> 00:31:45.500
All such persons are not important for Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:51.125
But if you start on proper lines you will be amazed,

00:31:51.417 --> 00:31:56.083
you’ll meet so many people who want peace of mind,

00:31:56.333 --> 00:32:03.333
peace of heart and a complete oneness with the Divine.

00:32:04.375 --> 00:32:06.625
They may not accept, they may not say,

00:32:07.208 --> 00:32:10.458
they might have gone to the wrong people also, possibly.

00:32:11.542 --> 00:32:13.667
But despite everything,

00:32:14.125 --> 00:32:19.667
they would like to have a real spiritual peace within themselves.

00:32:20.583 --> 00:32:24.542
Is a very common desire nowadays among people,

00:32:25.542 --> 00:32:28.458
but to approach that and to reach that,

00:32:29.125 --> 00:32:33.417
you have to take to a life of a very simple personality.

00:32:35.709 --> 00:32:40.458
You see, if you are so much interested in money,

00:32:42.041 --> 00:32:47.000
or if you are so much interested in your so-called powers

00:32:47.417 --> 00:32:53.667
or in your ambitions, then Sahaja Yoga cannot do anything.

00:32:54.417 --> 00:32:57.166
But if you are interested in your compassion

00:32:57.625 --> 00:33:01.667
and understanding about today’s world,

00:33:02.041 --> 00:33:05.375
how it is in a turmoil: why?

00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:09.500
Because of the human beings being in the wrong.

00:33:10.542 --> 00:33:16.166
What we have to do is to pass them the knowledge of the Divine.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.500
That should be your desire,

00:33:19.083 --> 00:33:23.417
and that is what you’ll feel very much comfortable with.

00:33:25.667 --> 00:33:30.000
All other desires, all other wants are,

00:33:30.625 --> 00:33:33.125
as you say, it’s very transitory.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:38.500
One desire is to spread Sahaja Yoga,

00:33:39.041 --> 00:33:43.166
is so beautiful that you go on working on it,

00:33:43.375 --> 00:33:46.000
and every time you do that,

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:48.667
you will be so joyous and happy,

00:33:49.542 --> 00:33:52.041
you’ll have no problems of any kind.

00:33:52.542 --> 00:33:56.458
That’s the sign of greatness of Sahaja Yoga,

00:33:57.166 --> 00:34:00.333
and I want you all to become like that.

00:34:01.375 --> 00:34:04.458
As today’s day is great, because

00:34:04.667 --> 00:34:09.500
we are thinking of all the great saints who came on this earth

00:34:10.166 --> 00:34:12.542
and who tried to lead us.  What they did,

00:34:12.709 --> 00:34:16.709
all of them tried to spread the truth all over the world.

00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:22.125
They suffered a lot, they had problems, so many problems,

00:34:22.542 --> 00:34:29.166
but they worked very hard in every way to spread Sahaja Yoga

00:34:29.417 --> 00:34:32.500
and talk about God anddivinity.

00:34:33.333 --> 00:34:36.667
All that is what today you have to give Me,

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:41.709
a promise, that whenever you get any other human being,

00:34:42.291 --> 00:34:44.333
you can tell them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:52.417
Not that it’s important but it’s absolutely

00:34:53.083 --> 00:34:55.417
immediate need of the world.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.500
If you understand this point,

00:34:58.709 --> 00:35:02.667
that at this time, why are you in this world

00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:05.458
and what is the need of the world,

00:35:05.709 --> 00:35:09.291
you will immediately start feeling the responsibility.

00:35:10.166 --> 00:35:13.166
Whether you are a man or a woman is not important.

00:35:13.583 --> 00:35:17.583
Go all out to preach, think,

00:35:18.625 --> 00:35:22.166
make people understand about Sahaja  Yoga

00:35:22.542 --> 00:35:24.583
in every way that is possible,

00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:28.709
and I think, then, you will become complete as gurus.

00:35:29.583 --> 00:35:33.250
If Sahaja Yoga is just with you, you cannot be a guru.

00:35:33.709 --> 00:35:37.041
‘Guru’ also doesn’t mean that you go on preaching about Sahaja Yoga

00:35:37.208 --> 00:35:40.625
talking about Sahaja Yoga, giving lectures about Sahaja Yoga, no!

00:35:41.458 --> 00:35:45.667
It means the one who gives realisations to others.

00:35:47.709 --> 00:35:53.125
How many people you give realisation is the thing,

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:57.667
not to be counted,  but to be felt within like the ripples,

00:35:58.625 --> 00:36:02.709
waves of the Ocean of Love in your heart.

00:36:03.542 --> 00:36:08.667
So beautiful it is to see that people get realisation

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:13.333
and are immersed in the joy of spirituality.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:19.583
That’s what I want you to do. That’s why I am on this earth.

00:36:20.166 --> 00:36:23.291
I had to suffer also quite a lot, doesn’t matter:

00:36:23.458 --> 00:36:26.542
so-called sufferings, I was watching it just like a drama.

00:36:27.333 --> 00:36:28.709
So it’s ok.

00:36:30.041 --> 00:36:32.166
As long as you do not pay much attention

00:36:32.291 --> 00:36:34.625
to all these sufferings, what is so great?

00:36:35.417 --> 00:36:42.041
Now you have seen yesterday a beautiful drama about Mohammad Sahib.

00:36:42.709 --> 00:36:47.542
I always used to think,  and it was such pain, about Him,  that

00:36:47.709 --> 00:36:51.583
how people have misunderstood and have gone astray:

00:36:52.333 --> 00:36:55.125
why they are doing all wrong things? Now,

00:36:55.709 --> 00:37:00.375
I feel happy that at least you people have realised His greatness,

00:37:00.667 --> 00:37:04.417
and have understood and made such a beautiful drama out of it.

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:08.709
I don’t know how far we can propagate this,

00:37:09.166 --> 00:37:13.417
but it’s a fact that Mohammad Sahib Himself

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:23.458
was finished, then also His daughter, grand-children were finished,

00:37:25.166 --> 00:37:27.083
His son-in-law was finished.

00:37:28.333 --> 00:37:30.291
And after that, by finishing them,

00:37:30.458 --> 00:37:34.375
they started another horrible thing called Sunnis.

00:37:35.333 --> 00:37:40.125
Now, the Sunnah religion is not near the truth at all,

00:37:40.333 --> 00:37:46.208
it’s some sort of a very aggressive and a very cruel religion,

00:37:47.333 --> 00:37:50.166
and that started spreading everywhere.

00:37:51.166 --> 00:37:56.375
In the real Islam religion of Mohammed Sahib was not there.

00:37:57.583 --> 00:38:01.500
Those people who killed Him started becoming ‘Islamic’.

00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:07.625
So this is also a very wrong thing,

00:38:08.041 --> 00:38:13.542
that a man who was so great and so much of spirituality

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:16.625
was not just accepted,

00:38:17.250 --> 00:38:20.458
and somebody who killed Him is now accepted.

00:38:21.417 --> 00:38:23.417
It can happen in anything.

00:38:23.709 --> 00:38:26.667
But the worst it has happened in is Islamic world,

00:38:27.166 --> 00:38:31.500
which is very dangerous, and that’s we see

00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:35.166
that, in the name of God, how many bad things they are doing.

00:38:39.125 --> 00:38:41.667
So, try to understand

00:38:42.333 --> 00:38:47.709
that it is not the fate of Mohammad Sahib it has happened,

00:38:48.625 --> 00:38:51.667
it’s not the fate of reality it has happened,

00:38:52.375 --> 00:38:55.625
but it’s an eye-opener for all of us to see

00:38:56.333 --> 00:39:03.333
that the Truth is always challenged by untruth.

00:39:04.375 --> 00:39:07.500
And we should stand by the Truth, whatever may happen.

00:39:09.041 --> 00:39:12.125
And a day will come when people will realise

00:39:12.333 --> 00:39:15.041
that this was a wrong thing they were being,

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:17.417
all the time been following,

00:39:18.208 --> 00:39:21.625
and have been doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:39:22.458 --> 00:39:27.125
All this will work out I am sure, very soon,

00:39:28.667 --> 00:39:33.291
if My desire is that powerful, I’m sure

00:39:33.542 --> 00:39:38.667
that they will realise that to be kind to be nice to be compassionate

00:39:39.583 --> 00:39:45.083
is the best way to feel happy, nothing more than that.

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:49.041
May God bless you.
