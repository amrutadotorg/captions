00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.280
Now the first Chakra is the one, which manifests
outside, the Pelvic plexus, which doctors know of.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.280
And this plexus looks after 
the excretory system of human beings.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.960
Even the sex is looked after by this particular center.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:34.440
Now, one must understand that Kundalini
does not pierce through the first chakra.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.400
So the sex does not play any part, 
in the ascending Kundalini.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.760
Those people who preach that through sex
you can reach God, are doing anti-God activities.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:56.240
One must know that if you indulge too much
into sex, and perverted sex,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.360
you develop deseases.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.320
Those people who are also austere type, 
who lead an unnatural life,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:14.640
also become very dry, and impossible to be understood
by anyone, as they have no emotion being left in them.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.240
So one has to be in the center of their innocence.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.960
Once you have maintained that innocence,
it is very easy to raise the Kundalini.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.200
There is a big force of the Kundalini raising in a person,
who has lead an innocent married life.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.520
But unfortunately, in the west especially,
many writers like Freud,

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.440
we should say philosophers
have done such harm to people.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.080
That the result of that today we are seeing
 in the deseases of such nature like AIDS.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:02.160
In Sahaja Yoga, automatically, once the Kundalini raises,
you start becoming a very balanced personality.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.720
That you lead a very sane sexual life.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.720
As a result of this nonsensical theory,
today we find, so many marriages broken,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.000
so many divorces, so many children stranded,
so many people hurt in their heart.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.080
Due to this satanic attack on human innocence,

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:32.120
human beings have accepted such absurd ideas,
that they think they have to now become a sex point.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:41.080
Instead of becoming a human being
which is an epitome of a complete creation,

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.760
the one who is the rightful owner of God’s kingdom,

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.960
the one who has to lead an eternal life,

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.800
the one who has to enjoy
the blissful benediction of his father.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:05.000
Today in this society, we find people 
who are wasting their life,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.000
ruining their families,

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.480
ruining their children.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.320
Women fighting with men, men fighting with women,
 it’s horrible.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.640
So one has to understand that
once the Kundalini gets awakened, a person

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:30.560
automatically starts gearing up
to the natural forces of the divinity.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.800
If both the partners are realized souls,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.840
the relationship is so deep,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.760
that even if they may not, soft of,
show off the relationship,

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.680
inside they had the security of oneness.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.560
The absolute enjoyment of romance manifests.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.960
Nowadays, Romeo and Juliette are changing
according to the hair style one has.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:10.040
You see, people going on an escalator for a divorce,
and showing off their love by kissing each other

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.400
and if you ask them “where are you going?”
they are going to the divorce case.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.680
Is this any development,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.120
where everyone is insecure?

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.560
Where every child faces the catastrophe
 which fall upon him one day?

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:32.840
Without realization, it is impossible now,
at this stage where the society is

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:40.280
at its disastrous point,
to understand the value of the companionship.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.880
So the first thing that happens
to a person is that he develops

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.040
a sane attitude towards sex and towards his partner.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:58.200
Of course, you don’t have to run away from sex,
but also not to be so much dominated by sex life,

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.000
that there is nothing else left in your life.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:15.040
Such strengthening boundaries are created
that you enjoy all that strength within yourself.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.480
You never hurt another person.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:23.960
You always make the other person really joyous.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.800
You see the good points of another person

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.920
and you have such tremendous capacity of wisdom

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.560
and poise,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.800
that the whole system changes.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.200
And the married life becomes a beautiful dream.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:48.200
There is a
very great writer in England called Barbara Cartland,

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.520
and they took her interview.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.520
She is a very religious woman,
a very nice person, a realized soul.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:02.280
And she is the most popular, her books
sell like hot cakes all over the world.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.000
And they ask her, how is it you manage that.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.520
So she said, every man and woman,

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:17.840
in their hearts of hearts,
want to lead a very happy, joyous, romantic life.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:27.040
But the key to that is
complete fidelity and loyalty and enjoyment of married life.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:36.400
And she goes further to say that
if you can produce such ideal romantic couples,

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.400
people like to see their imagination reflected.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.320
But that can be seen when you really get your realization,

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.040
automatically, you don’t have to read her.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.920
Secondly your innocence is awakened within you,

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.960
which grows gradually.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.360
And you enjoy your innocence.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.640
You enjoy your virtues.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.320
Sometimes we are very cunning, we are deceiving ourselves.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.920
Specially, the intelligence as a capacity to cheat itself.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:12.760
But you develop that pure intelligence which is called
as wisdom.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.320
But the manifestation of that is very great.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.840
A society of such people is so pure.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.960
The relationship
of husband wife are only private relationships,

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.840
but with others they are pure, absolutely pure relations.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.350
There are no complications.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.723
The life is so simple.

00:07:35.843 --> 00:07:38.459
There are no emotional problems.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:40.560
There are no sex problems.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.597
There are no problems about children.

00:07:43.717 --> 00:07:48.378
You get very beautiful realized souls as your children.

00:07:48.498 --> 00:07:49.898
Very healthy,

00:07:50.018 --> 00:07:51.338
very wise,

00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:53.458
and extremely joy giving.

00:07:53.578 --> 00:07:57.738
They don’t cry too much,
they don’t trouble you too much,

00:07:57.858 --> 00:08:04.218
but they are all the time thinking how to
respect their parents and how to give them joy.

00:08:04.338 --> 00:08:11.178
There are thousands and thousands in this
country I know, who are born realized children.

00:08:11.298 --> 00:08:16.178
I see them in the market,
I see them on the road, I see them in the restaurants.

00:08:16.298 --> 00:08:18.978
But the parents don’t understand them at all.

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:21.938
Because they are born at a higher level than their parents.

00:08:22.058 --> 00:08:24.578
They are special people taken birth.

00:08:24.698 --> 00:08:26.818
To do the great work of God.

00:08:26.938 --> 00:08:31.338
And unless and until, the parents are realized souls,

00:08:31.458 --> 00:08:35.483
they will be always the hindrance
to the children’s growth.
