00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.330
May 31, 1990

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:50.150
I bow to all the seekers of truth.
As you are seekers of truth, whatever one

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:17.189
may tell you, you should not accept it, to
begin with. People can claim anything but

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.090
that doesn’t mean that you must believe
into it, but one must know that truth is what

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:44.969
it is. We cannot organize it, we cannot maneuver
it, and we cannot create it. It is and it

00:01:53.459 --> 00:02:00.459
was and it will be, and I told you yesterday
what is the truth, and the truth is that you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.590
are the Spirit.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.810
You are not this body, you are not these conditionings,
your ego, your emotions, you are the Spirit.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.980
This is one thing, and then there is a subtle
power, living power, power of God’s love

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.610
that does all the living work, all the evolutionally
work, all the creation and all the comforting

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.489
and joyous things, which we do not feel, about
which people have talked in every scripture.

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:20.439
Like in the Bible, we say, is the “all-pervading
power of God”, or in Koran they call it

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:27.439
[sounds like MUDRAN], in Sanskrit language
it is called as Paramchaitanya. In every religion,

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:39.939
in every scripture which is sensible it’s
written about it. So the first thing one has

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.400
to do is to feel that power, unless and until
you can feel that power you cannot understand

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:02.090
any religion nor the people who came as incarnations
or as prophets, or as saints, and that is

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:14.319
the reason why all the saints had to suffer,
all the incarnations had to suffer, because

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:21.609
the people in general never knew there is
a subtle power of God’s love. As we say

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.220
there is God the Father, God the Son, there
has to be God the Mother. In every religion

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.920
except for Christianity, they have openly
talked about this Primordial Mother. Even

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:54.590
the Greeks knew about it, the Babylonians
knew about it, I was surprised that even in

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:02.450
South America there was a big, very big awakening
about it and they used to worship the Mother

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:16.810
God, but somehow in Christianity, I think
it was Paul, who was a Roman to begin with

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:35.770
and a tyrannical officer who even killed a
disciple of Christ, Stephan, he is the one

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:50.520
who changed the complete picture of Christianity.
He never knew Christ, he was epileptic and

00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:00.080
a very hot tempered man, and even he fought
with Mathew because he could not accept the

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:09.280
immaculate conception of Christ. A person
who is not even realized, who has led such

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:16.280
a tyrannical life, why did he come to Christianity?

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:25.300
He came to Christianity because he thought
it was a very good platform for him to jump

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:32.300
onto. I face that in Sahaja Yoga also. There
are people in Sahaja Yoga who come and they

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:40.760
just sometimes think that there’s such a
big cruelly affair they can handle, so they

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:51.330
try to rule and they try to take to power.
They do not even feel the vibrations, they

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:03.750
don’t even feel the all-pervading power,
but they think it’s a good platform to occupy.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:13.190
And this Mr. Paul was again born, was again
born as Augustine and he did even much worse

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:21.970
for Christianity.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:28.240
My father was a very learned man, I asked
him. I said, ”Who is this Paul and how is

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:35.240
it there?” So he told Me, “I don’t understand,
he is a stranger.” and then I asked why

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:46.180
Martin Luther, of all the things, did not
describe the Mother? He said it was true that

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:55.300
Martin Luther was a realized soul and he wanted
to deviate from Catholicism, but he thought,

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:02.560
at that time, to talk about the Mother would
not appeal to many people who where Islamic.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:11.460
So to convert them to Christianity would be
difficult. It was a little [EXPERIENCE OR

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:18.460
EXPERIMENT OR EXPERIMENCY, SOMETHING ALIKE],
I think, they did not refer to the Mother,

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:28.390
so they called it the “Holy Ghost”. It
was a funny thing to call, I tell you, really,

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:36.190
and then to call it a “dove”. That’s
also, I can’t understand, a symbol, all

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:45.400
the time you find a dove everywhere, but in
so many paintings I have seen people putting

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:53.970
their hands like this, who are the disciples
of Christ, and I see the light coming out

00:08:54.430 --> 00:09:01.430
of their heads. We have photographs, many
miraculous photographs, but of Sahaja Yogis,

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:09.760
all of them are sitting like you, and on their
head there is light, but all these things

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:22.070
took such a form, such an organization.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:29.560
Even a person like Khalil Gibran has talked
in complete chapter about Paul, denouncing

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:37.340
him completely. Nobody took heat of it, he
was an organizer and a power-oriented gentleman

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.430
wanted to have a big power and his place in
the Bible. How did he come in the Bible? I

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:51.430
mean, he has nothing to do with the Bible.
And even in the churches they read what he

00:09:53.240 --> 00:10:00.240
has said, an epileptic fellow. You will find
out in Sahaja Yoga that epilepsy is caused

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:10.460
by possession and if the possession is removed,
you can cure epilepsy. In Russia, we have

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:17.500
been able to cure epilepsy of so many people.
Of course, medicine doesn’t have this cure.

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:27.740
I Myself studied medicine and I know the limitations
of medicine, it deals just with the outdoor

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:35.550
systems of human beings. Is like a tree, which
is sick, so you try to look after the leaves

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:44.160
and give medicines to the leaves, how can
you cure the tree? You have to go to the roots,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.840
and to go to the roots you have to become
a subtler personality. If you can reach the

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:56.840
roots, then the whole tree can be nourished.
Now this is the knowledge of the roots, while

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:05.570
what we see outside is the knowledge of the
tree. If the tree grows much more into proportion

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:15.230
to the root, then you know what can happen,
and that’s what today we are afraid of,

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:22.029
that we might be completely destroyed. We
are on the brink of some sort of a horrible

00:11:22.029 --> 00:11:27.380
shock that’s going to come to us. It seems
there is a tremendous fear in the minds of

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:34.380
people there. Apart from the simple nature
of Americans they are also very much frightened

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:48.080
and whatever comes in their way they grow,
they try to get hold of it. This is another

00:11:53.810 --> 00:12:00.810
problem you are facing, there is nothing to
be afraid of; this world is not going to be

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:08.150
destroyed. The Creator, who has created you,
is the Father of all the Fathers and kindest

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:18.760
of all the kindest. He cannot allow His creation
to be destroyed, so don’t believe these

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:26.900
moneymakers who are telling you that this
world is going to be destroyed. That problem

00:12:28.589 --> 00:12:35.589
of war is over now, thanks to Gorbachev. The
other ecological problems also can be solved

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:43.760
if you people get your Realization, it’s
a very simple thing to solve the problem.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:52.400
But if you start getting at everything without
thinking, without discrimination, then definitely,

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:06.350
definitely, America could be destroyed and
if there is any country that will be destroyed,

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:12.250
first will be America, not from without, from
within. That’s why I am so concerned, so

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:19.250
concerned, that you should take some heat,
must pay some attention to this aspect what

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:27.610
is missing in us? Think of your children and
think of the progeny, and think of your country!

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:37.650
Where are we going? And then you’ll realize
you have failed in one point, that you have

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:46.120
not turned to your roots, not tried to find
out what your roots are. It’s useless to

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.589
say that this country is only two hundred
year old. Country may be two hundred year

00:13:50.589 --> 00:13:57.589
old, but you are not. You are antics, I would
say, you are born so many times before, in

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:04.440
so many countries and you have been seekers,
you are seekers and seekers, in ages you have

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:11.080
been growing in that seeking, and today you
are here to seek, but only thing what you

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:17.480
have lost in this seeking is the discrimination
and that’s why I say whatever one may say,

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:23.190
even if I say something, you need not believe,
please don’t! Blind faith is not going to

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:30.190
help you to get your Realization, neither
you’re denying it. You have to have an open

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:37.750
mind; as I told you, like a scientist, you
must see this hypothesis, if it [SOUNDS LIKE:

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:45.860
is there], if it works, then, please, as honest
people you must accept it. There is no secret

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:54.190
in Sahaja Yoga, no secret. My life is not
a secret; nothing is a secret, everybody knows

00:14:54.649 --> 00:15:00.630
what’s happening in Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:07.630
So, first of all, I have to tell you that
you keep your minds open when I have to tell

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:16.890
you about this machinery that is within us
created because of our evolution. As you see

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:26.660
there, there are seven centers, which are
placed in the central line, and there are

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:34.160
two lines on both the sides, left and right.
Out of these, the first center is below the

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:47.920
Kundalini, which is in the triangular bone
known as “sacrum”. “Sacrum” means

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:55.370
“secret” and Greek people, Greek museum
people told Me that Greeks considered this

00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:03.100
bone as a sacred bone. So in this resides
this power, which we call as “Kundalini”

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:16.420
in Sanskrit language. Now, this Kundalini
is coiled and the coil is called as “kundal”,

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:30.180
that’s why is called as “Kundalini”.
Now, it’s a female, is the power which is

00:16:31.709 --> 00:16:38.709
female and is the reflection of the Primordial
Mother in you, in Sanskrit called as “Adi

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:46.690
Shakti”. Of course, Indian knew about it
thousands of years back, no doubt, no doubt.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:53.350
Fourteen thousand years back, they say. I
don’t know if the English would accept that

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:58.240
we were that old, [SOUNDS LIKE - or not],
but it is said so, people have written about

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.250
it.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:07.250
This power rises, six centers it penetrates,
and the seventh one is at the base of it.

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:21.589
Now, the seventh one looks after your excretion
or if you are doctors you will understand

00:17:25.439 --> 00:17:32.439
it also looks after the pelvic plexus. So,
also the sex is looked after by this. So it

00:17:33.889 --> 00:17:40.889
is clear-cut that in your ascent sex plays
no part. That’s why Christ has said that

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:49.960
you have to be like small children to ascent.
Actually, when Kundalini rises, your attention

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:57.330
is no more on sex, all you excretionary functions
stop completely. So now, here, Mr. Freud,

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:11.340
or later on you can say Rasputin; or then
Rajneesh, all those who talked of sex being

00:18:14.649 --> 00:18:21.649
the power of Kundalini, are absolutely wrong.
And then how is it [then OR that?] Christ

00:18:23.619 --> 00:18:30.619
has said, he corrected the Ten Commandments,
out of that he said, “Thou shall not have

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:40.830
adulterous eyes!” Eyes, such a subtle point
is it. Why he said that? In America now, when

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:52.360
I come here, I mean, I see everybody has eyes
like this all the time, I mean, they don’t

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:59.360
have steady eyes at all. They are Christians,
followers of Christ, and sometimes surprises;

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:08.369
in the beginning, you see, one gets a cultural
shock to see what is this, [SOUNDS LIKE: what

00:19:08.369 --> 00:19:14.690
are you looking at], what are they looking
at? It’s a joyless pursuit, everyone knows,

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:21.690
but the eyes have become like that because
they have lost their innocence. But for your

00:19:22.989 --> 00:19:29.269
information, innocence is never lost, never
lost, only [SOUNDS LIKE: it gets conditioned]

00:19:29.269 --> 00:19:36.210
or clouded, that’s all, but it is never
lost. I have seen now in My work that everyone,

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:43.210
whether they were English, or they were Greeks,
or they were Americans, anybody who gets their

00:19:43.489 --> 00:19:50.489
awakening gets a steady eye and a innocent
eye. And these eyes could be so powerful that

00:19:52.259 --> 00:19:59.259
even attention of these eyes or even a glance
of these eyes can transform, can comfort,

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:10.440
can redeem and that’s why Christ has said
it, but actually the Deity of innocence resides

00:20:14.899 --> 00:20:21.899
there at the seventh center, he incarnates
as Christ at the sixth center here between

00:20:24.989 --> 00:20:31.989
the optic chiasm, which is giving energy to
our eyes. The essence of Bible can only be

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:49.730
understood if you are a realized soul and
you can read between the lines. Though I must

00:20:51.609 --> 00:20:56.710
say that this Mr. Paul has tried to destroy
a lot of it. Whatever he might have tried,

00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:03.710
there is so many truths still there in the
Bible and we can see them so clearly, we can

00:21:08.739 --> 00:21:14.929
feel them, we can understand them. I mean,
for example, once you are a realized soul,

00:21:14.929 --> 00:21:20.879
a Hindu might say, because I was born in a
Christian family, he would say, “Why did

00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:26.460
you take your birth in Christian family? You
believe in Christ?” I said, “Of course!”

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:32.869
So, I’ll just say, “Alright, you asked
a question like this, put hand towards Me

00:21:32.869 --> 00:21:39.869
and ask a question, call Me Mother. Mother,
is, was Christ the Son of God?” And he gets

00:21:42.169 --> 00:21:49.169
cool breeze on his hand, tremendous cool breeze
and he is surprised.

00:21:55.039 --> 00:22:01.919
Then we have the first center, which is, I
told you, is of sex and sex has nothing to

00:22:01.919 --> 00:22:08.919
do with your ascent. Only the human beings
can get their Realization, not animals. They

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:16.119
too have sex, but that does not mean that
sex, there is something wrong, it’s one

00:22:20.009 --> 00:22:25.989
of the functions of the body, is an important
function, but it has nothing to do with Divine

00:22:25.989 --> 00:22:32.989
work. As you go to bathroom, you have sex,
that’s all. So much accent of sex is given,

00:22:40.409 --> 00:22:47.409
I am surprised, despite that you have minus
population, while in India we never talk of

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:55.249
sex. I mean, this word “sex”, I could
not pronounce when I came to London first

00:22:55.249 --> 00:23:02.249
because we don’t say this word, is regarded
it spoils your tongue. To say “sex” also

00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:11.149
with your tongue was something impure. But
then I practiced a little bit [LAUGHTER],

00:23:15.659 --> 00:23:22.659
but I was very bashful while saying that.
So this is, it is not necessary to put such

00:23:26.889 --> 00:23:33.889
an accent and to have a mental thinking about
it because if you do it mentally too much,

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:40.330
then you are definitely, either you go to
one extreme become rapist and thinks like

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:44.869
that, and on the other side you might become
impotent, one of the two things will happen.

00:23:44.869 --> 00:23:49.809
[SOUNDS LIKE – I mean OR while?] in India,
we have seldom heard stories of rape and all

00:23:49.809 --> 00:23:56.809
that, seldom, and we never think of, I mean,
I am telling not about the westernized Indians

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:04.109
but about villagers, where an eighty year
old woman, grandmother, writing love letters

00:24:04.109 --> 00:24:09.200
to an eighteen year old grandson. I mean,
if you tell somebody, they’ll tell, they’ll

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:16.200
think I am befooling them, it’s impossible!
So whatever were natural barriers are finished

00:24:19.259 --> 00:24:25.929
by our so-called freedom, which is actually
a abandonment, but after Sahaja Yoga I don’t

00:24:25.929 --> 00:24:32.649
have to tell you anything. You just become
righteous, you just become righteous, I don’t

00:24:32.649 --> 00:24:39.649
have to tell you. Like people who take, took
drugs came to Sahaja Yoga and I must say,

00:24:40.119 --> 00:24:46.799
English are that way, something deep about
them also. Overnight they gave up their drugs,

00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:53.669
overnight! I didn’t tell them, I never told
them, I never even talked about the drugs,

00:24:53.669 --> 00:25:00.369
alcoholism. There is one doctor who was such
an alcoholic, he was out of job, he was [SOUNDS

00:25:00.369 --> 00:25:07.369
LIKE: undole OR undone], today he is running
seven hospitals in London, overnight. What

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:15.580
has happened actually? That, supposing you
are holding on to a snake and it’s darkness,

00:25:17.979 --> 00:25:23.249
and if I say, “There’s a snake in your
hand”, they say, “No, it’s not, it’s

00:25:23.249 --> 00:25:30.249
a rope.” How can you argue with a person,
till the snake bites? So you put on the light,

00:25:30.359 --> 00:25:35.249
with the light you throw it away yourself,
don’t have to tell anything, don’t have

00:25:35.249 --> 00:25:42.249
to argue. So the Spirit is enlightened, your
attention is enlightened with the light of

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:49.450
the Spirit, and you see what’s wrong, what’s
wrong with you. What are you holding onto,

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:55.769
and you just give it up and you become so
powerful to give up any habit, it’s so easy,

00:25:55.769 --> 00:25:59.759
so easy for you to give up.

00:25:59.759 --> 00:26:06.710
Overnight, I have seen people have given up
all their bad habits, which are really destructive,

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:13.710
these are all destructive habits. Whether
you like it or not, but they are destructive,

00:26:14.619 --> 00:26:21.619
let us face it, but you lose your will power
using in those habits. As a result, you cannot

00:26:25.059 --> 00:26:31.169
give it up, it’s a helpless condition, no
use forcing, no use giving lecturing, no use

00:26:31.169 --> 00:26:38.169
making a martyrdom out of it, nothing. Just
get your Self, get to your Self and your light

00:26:39.999 --> 00:26:46.999
of your Self will show you how powerful you
are, how great you are, what is your Glory,

00:26:47.309 --> 00:26:54.309
what is your identity. And then you are surprised
because you are connected with that Divine

00:26:54.340 --> 00:27:01.340
power and the power starts flowing through
you, and you are surprised how your life [is

00:27:02.289 --> 00:27:07.600
OR has?] changed and how you have become a
medium for God.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:14.600
Once, as of course coming to America, I was
coming by ship and our captain told Me that

00:27:18.109 --> 00:27:24.279
we are sending a SOS for a person who has
got pneumonia. I said, “I’ll go and cure

00:27:24.279 --> 00:27:29.700
that person.” But you see, I was the wife
of the owner, so they wouldn’t allow Me

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:36.220
to go down. I said, “Alright, you have got
Realization, you’ll just go and touch that

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:43.039
man, that’s all.” He went down and put
his hand on his lungs. I told him that, “Ask

00:27:43.039 --> 00:27:50.039
him to stop his bleeding [twice OR thrice?]”,
his pneumonia was cured, he was so amazed.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:57.200
He came up, he said, “How could I do it?”
I said, ”Because it’s flowing through

00:27:58.419 --> 00:28:05.229
you.” Even, supposing, an ordinary man gets
the kingdom and is asked to sit on the throne,

00:28:05.229 --> 00:28:11.309
he looks this side, that side, whether I should
sit or not, in the same way, though you achieve

00:28:11.309 --> 00:28:18.309
a position, such a high status, you are a
little frightened to occupy and to accept

00:28:19.479 --> 00:28:26.479
this position. But I have seen people who
are not realized souls, who do not know anything

00:28:27.099 --> 00:28:34.099
about Divinity, their lives are full of falsehood,
also they are very bad character people, they

00:28:37.149 --> 00:28:42.609
become big Gurus, shamelessly, they claim
such big, big things, they have no fear of

00:28:42.609 --> 00:28:47.919
God, they have no fear of anything. “So
what, if I have to go tomorrow to jail, doesn’t

00:28:47.919 --> 00:28:54.919
matter, I’ll have so much money with me!”
But a Sahaja Yogi is very humble, he keeps

00:28:56.570 --> 00:29:01.460
to himself, he is very contented and he doesn’t
change his outward dress or he doesn’t put

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:08.460
on some sort of a funny dress, but he is normal
just like as you are. He doesn’t do anything

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:16.580
abnormal. I think, the Sahaja Yogis become
the most normal people, but you'll be surprised,

00:29:18.179 --> 00:29:22.139
those who have seen them say that, “These
are angels! These are not human beings, these

00:29:22.139 --> 00:29:26.429
are angels.”

00:29:26.429 --> 00:29:33.429
So this transformation takes place as this
Kundalini rises on in our centers, so the

00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:40.479
first center according to real, where the
Kundalini enters, is the second one, which

00:29:40.479 --> 00:29:47.479
you see as the yellow one. Now, this is the
center, which is responsible for our creativity.

00:29:49.109 --> 00:29:55.340
I have seen many artists in India who are
extremely anxious to play before Me, and once

00:29:55.340 --> 00:30:01.820
they have played before Me or twice, they
become world’s famous artists, so many of

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:06.639
them will tell you about Me. Now they want
to take My photograph and put it there to

00:30:06.639 --> 00:30:10.739
show to people that I am their Guru. I said
not to do it, “I am not your Guru I am not

00:30:10.739 --> 00:30:15.419
talking about music, the only thing is, your
Kundalini has risen, I have nothing to do

00:30:15.419 --> 00:30:20.840
with it. You had your technique with you,
only thing, because your Kundalini has risen,

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:27.840
you have become so dynamic and you are expressing
yourself without any fear, without any inhibition.”

00:30:27.879 --> 00:30:34.879
Simple thing as that, but this center be used
too much, specially in the West, when we think

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:44.330
too much. And when we think too much, we use
the energy of this center because this center

00:30:47.169 --> 00:30:54.109
is responsible for converting fat cells into
gray cells for the use of the brain. So, when

00:30:54.109 --> 00:31:01.109
you think too much, then it gets entangled
or it gets busy with this only one function,

00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:09.210
while it has to do many other functions. Like
it has to look after your liver, it has to

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:16.210
look after your pancreas, it has to look after
your spleen, it has to look after your intestines,

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:25.080
and also your kidneys. So a person who thinks
too much, plans too much, who is futuristic,

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:33.549
such a person gets a bad liver and when you
get a bad liver, means an overactive liver,

00:31:33.549 --> 00:31:39.719
the function of liver is to absorb the heat,
which is a poison within us, and to release

00:31:39.719 --> 00:31:46.719
it to, into the blood stream, becomes impossible.
So, the heat starts rising, your lungs collapse

00:31:50.729 --> 00:31:57.729
with the heat, you get asthma. If it rises
higher, you might get a massive heart attack,

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:06.450
it goes lower down, then you get constipation,
it can coagulate your kidneys, you get your

00:32:08.129 --> 00:32:13.259
kidneys troubled, you cannot pass urine. Only
one liver can bring all these problems to

00:32:13.259 --> 00:32:20.259
you. Now the second thing that is affected
by over-thinking is your pancreas, by which

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:27.450
you get diabetes. Now in India, in the village
if you go, even in Nepal, they take sugar

00:32:29.729 --> 00:32:35.499
as much that the spoon must stand at right
angle, so much sugar they must take. They

00:32:35.499 --> 00:32:42.499
never get diabetes, never, never, they don’t
know what diabetes is, because they work the

00:32:43.039 --> 00:32:48.519
whole day, and in the night they sleep [on
OR off?], again next day they get up, work

00:32:48.519 --> 00:32:55.519
the whole day, they don’t think. Same with
their wives, they also don’t think because

00:32:56.179 --> 00:33:01.479
same way they work in the daytime and sleep
in the night. But too much [SOUNDS LIKE prayer

00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:05.749
OR freer OR payer?] time when we have, we
start thinking, they do not future plan so

00:33:05.749 --> 00:33:12.379
much, whatever comes their way, they’ll
arrange it, organize it and live with it.

00:33:12.379 --> 00:33:18.899
So this diabetes is a special disease of the
people who are planners, who are futuristic,

00:33:18.899 --> 00:33:25.899
who think too much and who worry too much,
and it’s a vicious circle. Once you get

00:33:28.109 --> 00:33:33.940
diabetes, you worry too much, so you get more
diabetes.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:39.809
Then comes the third disease, which is much
more dangerous and very common in America,

00:33:39.809 --> 00:33:45.179
comes from the spleen. Spleen also is to be
looked after by the same center, which we

00:33:45.179 --> 00:33:52.179
call as Swadisthan. Now the spleen part, the
role of spleen in our body is very important

00:33:56.899 --> 00:34:03.899
because it keeps our rhythm, it’s for the
rhythm of the body, rhythm with the nature.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:13.840
Now our life is so hectic. Now, it has to
produce red blood corpuscles according to

00:34:14.539 --> 00:34:21.539
certain rhythm, but we have no rhythm. Any
emergency that comes in, it has to produce

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:28.440
red blood corpuscles, but since early in the
morning we read the newspaper, this is the

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:34.460
worst curse, I think, for spleen, so you get
a shock, so many killed, I mean, they will

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:40.359
never give a good news, never, out of question
because they have to give sensations to you,

00:34:40.359 --> 00:34:47.359
see, shocks, so they’ll give horrible news
by which your spleen will start pulsating,

00:34:48.529 --> 00:34:53.889
giving you more [SOUNDS LIKE arbises OR abases
OR diseases?], then you get in your car without

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:58.210
taking your breakfast, the breakfast is in
your hand, you are eating something driving

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:05.210
because you are getting late, we are time-bound.
On the way we find all the road jammed, then

00:35:05.359 --> 00:35:11.270
we get again upset, how are we to reach? Then
we go to the office, we are slightly late,

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:16.849
then the boss is shouting at you and you are
in a mess. All these things build up a tension,

00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:21.390
as we call it, but is nothing but ordinary
[SOUNDS LIKE unrhythmic OR unarrhythmic?]

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:24.630
hectic life of our [SOUNDS LIKE tied cuses
????].

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:29.890
Actually, the life should be such that you
start your office at eleven o’clock, better

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:36.890
is [LAUGHTER], and you sit down with your
wife, have your food in a rhythmic way, and

00:35:38.829 --> 00:35:44.460
in the daytime you must have siesta. If Americans
have their siesta in the daytime, all their

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:50.849
tensions will disappear, because in the daytime
all the Deities sleep, all the Deities who

00:35:50.849 --> 00:35:57.020
are on these centers they sleep. So if you
can have a siesta even for half an hour, I

00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:02.680
tell you, your tensions will disappear. On
the contrary, the pressure amounts on with

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:07.650
the work, this is to be done, that is to be
done, rush, I mean, the Americans never used

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:12.400
to speak so fast, I tell you. Nowadays you
can’t follow any news, you can’t follow

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:17.529
what they speak, I mean, it’s impossible
because the words go like telescope [SOUNDS

00:36:17.529 --> 00:36:24.200
LIKE: into one each other OR go run each other?].
And the whole life is so made that you feel

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:31.130
that they are all under some sort of a earthquake
shock or something. Everybody is running helter-skelter,

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:37.130
this, that, you go to a shop, you go, really,
if you see, everybody is having a rat race,

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:43.700
on the road, anywhere, this is the curse of
the modern times, but also the blessing of

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:50.700
modern times is Sahaja Yoga. That’s why
there is because all these problems have come

00:36:51.359 --> 00:36:58.359
up, that is why now we have this blessing
of Sahaja Yoga also. So what happens that

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:06.920
when we, poor spleen becomes arrhythmic and
crazy, then any shock from the left side can

00:37:15.289 --> 00:37:22.289
manifest a very serious disease called as
blood cancer. Now, this blood cancer has been

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:31.450
definitely cured by your Kundalini awakening.
I don’t cure because if I say that, all

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:38.450
the government will arrest Me, so I would
say, “Your Kundalini cures this blood cancer,

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:48.170
and there are many who have been cured of
blood cancer.”

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:55.240
Then the third problem is of high blood pressure,
comes from the kidney. The kidney also coagulates,

00:37:55.430 --> 00:38:00.599
to begin with it is in such a small dimension
that you don’t feel it, but because of that

00:38:00.599 --> 00:38:07.599
the pressure rises, then it stops functioning
because it coagulates. This also is absolutely

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:18.680
curable through the awakening of your Kundalini.
Then the last is the constipation. I mean,

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:28.910
I have seen in Switzerland people eat something
that we give it to buffalos in India, I mean,

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:37.460
we cannot think of eating that. I was shocked,
I said, “How can you eat these cotton seeds?”

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:42.250
He said, “That’s very good for roughage”,
but I said, “What this roughage? Tomorrow

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:48.109
you’ll start eating wood or what? Why do
you need so much roughage?” “Because of

00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:55.010
this problem.”
So nothing seems to be normal for people who

00:38:55.010 --> 00:39:01.930
think too much, and the other side is where
they don’t think at all, absolutely lethargic

00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:06.990
organs also. So there a two types of human
beings, one on the right side, one on the

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:12.270
left side. Those who are sitting and crying
and weeping about their past, “I had a very

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:17.200
nice time and now it’s horrid; I had very
good parents and now a horrid husband!”,

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:23.099
sort of things goes on and on and on. At that
time, they become left sided. So we have two

00:39:23.099 --> 00:39:28.990
types of people, one who are thinking of the
future and those who are thinking of the past.

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:35.990
Both the sides are nourished or looked after
by what we call the left and right sympathetic

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:43.240
nervous system. The left looks after the left
side and the right looks after the right side.

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:50.240
But if we somehow or other get into the center,
then we do not suffer from anyone of these

00:39:56.289 --> 00:40:02.210
troubles. Our attention is, say, like a sari,
I’ll show you, like this it moves up and

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:07.220
it pulls all our attention in the center through
the Kundalini, till it pierces through the

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:14.220
seventh center, and then we are in the center.
Once we come in the center, we are absolutely

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:22.710
there, we are in moderation. We know how far
to go with everything and we lead a very peaceful,

00:40:25.099 --> 00:40:32.099
nice life. We accept the life with great joy
as it is. We don’t hanker, we have no greed

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:41.910
left, there is no lust left, but we enjoy
the sex life we have, in the same way we enjoy

00:40:44.329 --> 00:40:50.119
all the [SOUNDS LIKE: material?] things in
the best way possible. For example, now see,

00:40:50.119 --> 00:40:57.119
this is the carpet laying down here. When
I watch this, it’s so beautiful. But when

00:40:57.660 --> 00:41:01.250
I watch this and start thinking about it,
“Now, how much it must have cost?” Of

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:05.319
course, if it belongs to Me, then it’s a
headache because already I will start seeing

00:41:05.319 --> 00:41:12.319
if there are any spots, whether it is insured
or not, and if somebody has spoiled it? But

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:16.809
supposing it doesn’t belong to Me, thank
God if that’s so, then also I’ll think,

00:41:16.809 --> 00:41:20.430
“How much it must have cost?”, I might
feel jealous, so “I should have one like

00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:25.750
this, I don't have. From what shop the lady
must have bought it? I must go there and get

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:26.019
it.”

00:41:26.019 --> 00:41:31.289
All these thoughts will be coming into My
head, not the beauty of the carpet, but when

00:41:31.289 --> 00:41:38.289
this Kundalini rises and crosses over this
center of Christ, then your thoughts become

00:41:39.029 --> 00:41:46.029
quiet, you become a personality, which we
call as in the stage of “thoughtless awareness”,

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:55.670
where you are aware, but no thought. Because
we think of the future, we think of the past,

00:41:56.809 --> 00:42:03.809
but we cannot be in the present, but in thoughtless
awareness we are in present, there is no thought.

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:10.930
And then the whole thing, that is, the beauty
that was created by the Creator, the joy that

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:18.170
was putting to it, starts pouring on to you,
and you start enjoying, just enjoying, not

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:25.170
thinking about it. Just seeing, not saying
anything, no reaction, just watching, and

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:34.150
the whole of it just pours down. So this is
the state when it comes to your thinking,

00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:43.829
becomes limited and then your Swadisthana
Chakra gets settled down, it gets also nourished

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:52.869
by Kundalini and that is how most of your
problems are solved because every center,

00:42:52.869 --> 00:42:59.869
when it goes out of order, it creates the
so-called human problems, but Kundalini-rising

00:43:00.769 --> 00:43:07.769
means it integrates all of them. Once you
are a realized soul, your mind won’t argue

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:17.720
with your heart, with your liver, your brain,
but in a very integrated manner you will enjoy

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:28.740
everything. You become a witness to a drama.
Like there’s drama going on, you watch the

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:35.500
drama and you are involved into it, but once
the drama is over, then you say, “Oh, I

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:40.369
am here, I am just a spectator, I am not in
the drama.” In the same way, the whole thing

00:43:40.369 --> 00:43:47.369
becomes like a drama and you are away from
it. Your problems are like waves, they rise

00:43:48.029 --> 00:43:54.230
and fall, but once you are in the boat, you
can see them clearly and you can solve them,

00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:59.529
but in case you know how to swim, you can
jump in and safe others from drowning.

00:43:59.529 --> 00:44:04.519
This is the third stage where you have to
rise, in that stage we call it as the “doubtless

00:44:04.519 --> 00:44:10.440
awareness”, is called as “Nirvikalpa Samadhi”.
They talk of Yoga, this thing, Hatha Yoga

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:14.010
and all that. What is Hatha Yoga? [SANSKRIT
WORD: Asthanga? YOGA], as there are eight

00:44:14.010 --> 00:44:18.980
[UNAUDIBLE, SOUNDS LIKE: fold?] things out
of which, these exercises, is just a wee wee

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:24.130
wee wee wee weet ..and that, too, is to be
applied only when the Kundalini rises, when

00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:29.539
there is a problem, but here the way we take
this Hatha Yoga is something like a medicine

00:44:29.539 --> 00:44:36.539
box. The whole of that without paying any
attention to our Spirit, is for the spiritual

00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:44.349
growth, not for physical, because if you see
the book of Patanjali, which is so big as

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:49.539
that, there he has discussed only what I am
telling you today, and not these things that

00:44:49.539 --> 00:44:56.539
you stand on your head or you walk like this
or you jog like that. These things come up

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:02.869
as a [SOUNDS LIKE: craves?] and we are very
vulnerable to all these things, but if you

00:45:02.869 --> 00:45:08.049
just look back, you will see, this is all
entrepreneurs staff, they are just trying

00:45:08.049 --> 00:45:15.049
to befool us. Not only the Gurus, but also
the entrepreneurs, they are trying to befool

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:20.230
us, they tell us, “Now, you must jog because
then you must have jogging suits, you must

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:25.500
have jogging shoes, you must have jogging
this and jogging that, and you pay for it.”

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:31.359
All the time they are suggesting, “This
is the fashion now!” Start a fashion with

00:45:31.359 --> 00:45:37.200
the tight pants, now, then they develop very
[SOUNDS LIKE: close] pants, now then, loose

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:44.200
pants. It’s just a way of befooling simple
good people, taking advantage of them, and

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:52.869
we are slaves. But all these things finish
off once you get your Realization, you understand

00:45:52.869 --> 00:45:57.880
these things very well, and you know all these
crooks, and you don’t play into their hands.

00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:04.880
There is no need, there is no need to go on
wasting your energy in changing your form,

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:13.069
dresses, changing everything morning till
evening, making a heap of plastic, which cannot

00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:19.510
be burned, which cannot be done. You become
really sensible, wise, righteous, beautiful,

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:26.510
dynamic, compassionate people in the real
sense of the word and your priorities becomes

00:46:30.529 --> 00:46:37.529
so sensible that you are amazed of yourself,
“How have I become like this?”

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:46.880
Then we have artists, we have painters, we
have all kinds of people in Sahaja Yoga who

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:55.710
have really prospered in their own profession,
doctors have prospered in their own profession,

00:46:56.430 --> 00:47:03.430
but they are extremely humble, compassionate,
sensible, and they are spirit-oriented, not

00:47:04.529 --> 00:47:09.440
money-oriented. And then the money flows,
you don’t have to worry about money. Once

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:14.900
you are spirit-oriented, money is at your
feet, knowledge is at your feet, everything

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:21.900
at your feet, because you are blessed. We
have lost the faith in the blessings of God

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:30.710
because we are away from Him, but in His Kingdom,
you’ll be surprised how it works, it’s

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:40.940
miraculous, is miraculous, every small little
need is looked after and at every small point,

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:50.990
you see, the hand of the Devine trying to
help you. That you see yourself. I told them

00:47:55.710 --> 00:48:02.359
that they better write about the miracles
of Sahaja Yoga. When they wrote it, it’s

00:48:02.359 --> 00:48:09.359
so big as that, a pile. I said, “Forget
it, how are we going to publish this?” And

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:17.740
that is what just going to happen, that’s
what you deserve. After all, you are human

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:26.190
beings. Those people who tell you, “You
are sinners!” and all that, please know

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:33.190
that they must be the greatest sinners ever
born, don’t believe all that, you are human

00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:40.630
beings after all. Only human beings can make
mistakes, you are not Gods. So if you have

00:48:42.759 --> 00:48:48.529
made some mistakes, why do they want you to
feel guilty? If you feel guilty, you spoil

00:48:48.529 --> 00:48:55.210
this center here, and you get horrible problems
of angina or you might get also spondylitis,

00:48:55.210 --> 00:49:00.720
so many troubles with this guilt business.

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:07.720
So, please remember that you are a human being
and you have every right to be united with

00:49:08.529 --> 00:49:13.109
the Divine power, and that’s what Sahaja
Yoga is. “Saha” means “with”, “ja”

00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:18.980
is “born with you”, is the right to this
“Yoga”, means the “union with the Devine”.

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:24.599
Yoga doesn’t mean standing on your heads,
it doesn’t mean anything. If any person

00:49:24.599 --> 00:49:31.599
who talks of Yoga and doesn’t give you Realization,
don’t go near that person! Yesterday I told

00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:38.750
you, first thing, nobody can take money from
you. Of course, for this hall they have paid,

00:49:39.559 --> 00:49:46.559
the Sahaja Yogis have paid, I must say, but
we were just thinking that last four years

00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:50.890
they have started paying, otherwise I used
to pay, My husband used to pay for everything.

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:54.180
But then they said, “You should not pay
for our salvation, Mother, that’s too much.”

00:49:54.180 --> 00:50:01.009
Now they have started paying for it, but not
for your Realization, not to Me, but to this

00:50:01.009 --> 00:50:08.009
hall, alright, doesn’t matter. And everything,
the accounts and everything, should be clear-cut,

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:16.559
you should see where your money goes, what
it happens, what it works on, who is handling

00:50:16.559 --> 00:50:23.559
the money? Then you have to see if they give
you Realization or not? Realization means,

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:31.349
you must feel the cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost. Realization means that you should have

00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:38.259
powers to raise the Kundalini of others. Realization
means that you feel the actualization of the

00:50:38.259 --> 00:50:42.960
baptism, the cool breeze coming out of your
head, not any priest putting water on your

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:49.960
head and say that, “You are now a Christian.”
Unless and until these things happen to you,

00:50:53.960 --> 00:51:00.960
don’t accept anyone, even Me. This is what
one has to understand, you have to become

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:09.619
something, and the time is there, is being
announced, this time has to come, and the

00:51:09.619 --> 00:51:16.619
time has come and where are the people? That
I should find those people in Russia, I was

00:51:17.359 --> 00:51:21.890
really surprised, who never had heard about
God, they never had heard about anything about

00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:28.890
Spirit, they were not supposed to talk about
it, and there you have thousands, how is it,

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:37.900
thousands! This hall, we had a hall like this,
ten times bigger than this, was all completely

00:51:38.359 --> 00:51:45.359
full and the same amount of people was sitting
outside. They had never known Me, they had

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:50.240
never seen My face, nothing, only with the
photographs, they were so sensitive. Also

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:57.240
Italians, I must say, Italians have that sensibility,
and Greeks. Why not the Americans? You must

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:08.220
research it out, you have such a capacity
to do research, for everything you do research,

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:12.529
for your car even you do research, for your
sofa set you do research, and for even shoes,

00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:19.200
they said, they have researched it and made
it comfortable. [LAUGHTER] Then why not research

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:26.200
and find out? At least have that scientific
attitude and try to solve the problems that

00:52:30.769 --> 00:52:37.049
you have. You all can do it; I know it’s
very capable to do it. Those who become Sahaja

00:52:37.049 --> 00:52:44.049
Yogis, Americans, are great people, but first
of all is impossible to make them stick to

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:51.740
one thing. As they change their cars, change
their houses, change their motorcars, they

00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:57.619
are going on changing their Gurus also, you
see, is like a Guru shopping going on. Actually,

00:52:57.619 --> 00:53:04.619
you see, I also belong to another kind of
a society, so-called elite society, and I

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:09.890
just keep quiet, I never say a word there
because I am absolutely useless. And what

00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:13.630
they talk, like this, “Oh, have you been
to this Guru, this saintly, you know? There’s

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:19.779
a lady, she comes with a van and she has those
laser beams and things like that, she is very

00:53:19.779 --> 00:53:24.819
expensive, but very good. Very expensive,
but she can give you a little bargain, if

00:53:24.819 --> 00:53:31.819
you bargain with her she might, or somebody
is for sale.” Can you imagine? God does

00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:44.630
not know money, does He? We sold Christ; did
we pay anything to Christ? At least the Christians

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:56.650
should not pay! Now, of course, Hindus never
paid anything to Rama, Krishna, nothing, of

00:53:57.859 --> 00:54:04.859
course [SOUNDS LIKE: that’s OR it’s just?]
there. But this one test you must put, and

00:54:09.930 --> 00:54:16.930
then the second one that you have to get something
yourself. You must get something and that

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:22.769
is your Self Realization, not craziness that
on the street say “Hare Rama, Hare Krishna,

00:54:22.769 --> 00:54:28.470
Hare Hare Rama.” What is this? Anybody can
do it, in India everybody does that. Wearing

00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:35.470
such dresses, what is so difficult? Also in
the supermarket you get that thing, just put

00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:42.740
it on your head, it’s ridiculous! If you
ask any sensible man in India to do that,

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:49.940
he’d say, “Am I mad, why will I do it?”
Also cut your hair this way or to wear some

00:54:52.009 --> 00:54:57.559
nonsensical dress, what is so great about,
what is so great? Anybody can do it. Or some

00:54:57.559 --> 00:55:03.289
people start jumping and saying all kinds
of things, and they said that, “Now we have

00:55:03.289 --> 00:55:10.289
got the language, we are speaking some other
language.” Mad people! I mean, if you are

00:55:10.289 --> 00:55:17.289
near God, you have to become a much more sensible,
wise, saint people, isn’t it? You have seen

00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:23.819
the saints, you have seen Zen people, you
have seen all of them, how sensible they were.

00:55:23.819 --> 00:55:30.819
Were they mad? All kinds of craziness is associated
with God, I can’t understand that. Now,

00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:40.140
be wise and discriminating and try to understand,
it is through you people only is going to

00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:50.400
work out.

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:57.400
I had asked you to ask Me some questions.
In these one or two days, I am sorry, I can’t

00:55:57.579 --> 00:56:03.900
tell you everything about Sahaja Yoga, but
they will give you books and everything, you

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:07.160
can read them and you’ll understand about
everything, about chakras, and they are quite

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:13.309
experts and they all tell you about it. Now
say, there are so many lights here. When you

00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:18.920
come in, I’ll have to just say, “Alright,
put on that switch!” and all of them will

00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:24.059
come up. But if I have to tell you all about
the history and everything about electricity,

00:56:24.059 --> 00:56:28.730
and then where it is stored and how it has
come, you’ll be bored stiff. Best thing

00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:35.599
is you have the light first and then we’ll
talk about it. So if you are hungry, I have

00:56:35.599 --> 00:56:42.029
done the cooking, I would say, better have
it, and then we’ll discuss it and talk about

00:56:42.029 --> 00:56:47.890
it, and there are thousands and thousands
of My lectures, which you can listen to, and

00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:51.630
you can know a lot, you can become all experts,
you can all become big Gurus, no doubt about

00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:58.630
it. [LAUGHTER] You’ll become your own Gurus,
I promise, you will become your own Gurus

00:57:01.599 --> 00:57:08.599
because you are meant to be that, you don’t
need any Guru, your Spirit is your Guru and

00:57:12.869 --> 00:57:19.869
that will guide you. It’s like if you take
a, say, television from America and show it

00:57:20.869 --> 00:57:26.690
to the Indians in the village and say that,
“In this box you can see the films coming

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:31.109
from all over the world”, they will say,
“What? Telling lies? How can this box give

00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:37.809
us this?”, but you put to the mains. In
the same way, you are put to the mains and

00:57:37.809 --> 00:57:44.809
then you see how fantastic you are, all your
fears, all your problems will just dissolve.

00:57:47.099 --> 00:57:54.099
But you must penetrate into it, deeper and
deeper. Like we had three or four people whom

00:57:54.269 --> 00:57:58.849
I gave Realization, and next day they went
to do all kinds of nonsensical things, and

00:57:58.849 --> 00:58:05.849
now they have got Aids. What can I do? Four,
five years back I gave them Realization nicely,

00:58:08.999 --> 00:58:13.049
they never settled down, they went to some
other Gurus and some places and all that,

00:58:13.049 --> 00:58:20.049
and they got Aids now there and now suffering
from Aids. Of course they can be cured, but

00:58:20.269 --> 00:58:27.269
not in America, how can I cure them? I’ll
be again arrested. This is a problem. So you

00:58:31.019 --> 00:58:36.710
have to get into it deeply and to understand
it, and to become masters. You don’t have

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:39.490
to pay for it, again and again I am saying
[SOUNDS LIKE: so OR it OR it so??], only thing

00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:44.779
you have to give some time. And we have so
much time otherwise. These watches are with

00:58:44.779 --> 00:58:51.779
us because we should save time, but we save
time for wasting. We have to save time for

00:58:55.249 --> 00:59:02.249
our ascent, not much, five minutes in the
morning, ten minutes in the evening is sufficient,

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:11.140
and every week, once a week, you have to come
to the center, then you will not give up.

00:59:11.799 --> 00:59:16.160
After some time, the greatest punishment for
[a???] Sahaja Yogi is that you have to go

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:22.319
out of Sahaja Yoga, is the greatest punishment.
There is no compulsion in Sahaja Yoga. If

00:59:22.319 --> 00:59:27.130
you want to go away, you can go away. But
sometimes we have to ask them to get out,

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:32.420
some of them have to get out and they feel
very sad about it, but then they correct themselves,

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:39.420
purify themselves and again come back. But
the movement in America is the least, much

00:59:40.589 --> 00:59:47.569
less than even South America, much, much less.
So I have to request you now in San Diego,

00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:54.569
last time also, first time I came to San Diego,
so again I request you all that you, because

00:59:55.130 --> 01:00:02.130
you belong to the city of Gods, so you have
to take up the responsibility and…

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:10.380
Part 2
Now, of course, I would like to have some

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:22.440
questions and if they are written down, it’s
better. Yes, please, give it to him. And after

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:30.700
this we’ll have the session of Realization,
it will take only ten minutes.

01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:39.690
QUESTION: [INAUDIBLE] Shri Mataji, when did
you realize your mission? [SOUNDS LIKE: With

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:53.650
which?] masters did you gain your inside,
or was it always there?

01:00:59.539 --> 01:01:06.519
SHRI MATAJI: Always there, I was born with
it.

01:01:06.519 --> 01:01:13.519
QUESTION: [INAUDIBLE, SOUNDS LIKE: to reach
an environment?] spending a lot of money,

01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:32.069
but nothing seems to work. What is the difference
between Sahaja Yoga and these other practices

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.480
[INAUDIBLE – MAYBE Rajneesh??], TM and Hatha
Yoga, among other things?

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:44.480
SHRI MATAJI: TM is the worst, worst of all!
You see, in TM, I must tell you, I didn’t

01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:54.940
know well what they were doing in TM, but
the head of the “flying foundation” in

01:01:55.259 --> 01:02:02.259
Scotland, in [SOUNDS LIKE: Ranac?], this fellow
was Peter Pears and his wife, she is the granddaughter

01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:11.789
[SOUNDS LIKE: is one?] duke, her name is Linda.
And somebody came to tell Me about them, that

01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:21.569
they are suffering from epilepsy and they
are in a very bad shape, so I said, “Alright,

01:02:23.329 --> 01:02:28.210
I would like to see them.” I didn’t know
they were doing TM or anything, so they came

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:35.210
to Me and I asked them, “Who is your Guru?”
So they said, “We went to TM, and I am teaching

01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:46.730
TM, I was.” And he told Me such horrible
things about it. He is writing a book now

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:55.980
about it, that first of all, he told Me, there
are three mantras they used to give, and you

01:02:56.809 --> 01:03:03.809
were told not to tell anybody, see? And these
mantras were so funny that if you had told

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:12.849
it to any Indian he would have really laughed,
because they were not even Sanskrit. The first

01:03:12.849 --> 01:03:19.849
one was “Inga”. “Inga” means the “bite
of a scorpion”, not in Sanskrit language.

01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:26.450
Then the second one is a “Binga”, and
a “Binga” means “when a person gets

01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:33.089
possessed and goes round and round”, he’s
a “Binga”. And the third one is a “Tinga”,

01:03:33.089 --> 01:03:37.460
which one is that when you show like this
somebody the tongue, you don’t know what

01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:44.460
to say, “Tinga”, to show like this. And
everybody was asked to pay three hundred pounds

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:54.220
for this so-called Mantra and this fellow,
or the Guru, used to sit on the seventh heaven

01:03:56.470 --> 01:04:02.349
somewhere, and the person had to come through
six, seven rooms, and [SOUNDS LIKE: untört?]

01:04:02.349 --> 01:04:06.999
the great Guru, [[SOUNDS LIKE: he’s?] only
four feet five inches with the squinty eyes

01:04:06.999 --> 01:04:13.999
sitting there, and the Guru would tell this
Mantra in the ears, taking three hundred pounds

01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:16.710
at the first door.

01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:21.150
Then there was another six thousand pounds.
They said, “Nothing works out, we are going

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:27.289
mad with it, so alright, no no no.” So the
second course. The second course they started,

01:04:27.289 --> 01:04:33.940
he told Me, was to go to [SOUNDS LIKE: Sitacus?]
or something like that. In that, they had

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:39.269
to go to Switzerland, pay six thousand pounds
each, and in a big hall like this they were

01:04:39.269 --> 01:04:46.269
all supposed to sit down and jump on cushions
and jump on some sort of a [SOUNDS LIKE: fo

01:04:47.979 --> 01:04:54.979
?]. And they were given for six days the water
that boiled some potatoes, six days, and the

01:04:58.269 --> 01:05:05.269
seventh day they were given the rind to eat,
and the eighth day they gave them to eat the

01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:12.940
potatoes because they were supposed to become
very light. And they all broke their bottoms

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:19.749
because they had to jump very high on that,
but for what? Because he said, “Then you

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:23.130
can fly in the air.“ But I said, “Why
do you want to fly like this, already we have

01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:30.130
problems of, you see, cars and things, and
if you start flying with them, what will happen?

01:05:31.259 --> 01:05:36.059
What is the need? You can fly by aero plane,
why do you want to fly like this?” Such

01:05:36.059 --> 01:05:43.059
funny ideas! But then I found they had become
recluses, all these people had become recluses,

01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:50.390
and had become epileptic. Then I called him,
his wife and his deputy director, thank God,

01:05:53.140 --> 01:06:00.140
My husband had gone out on some work for about
a month, so they stayed in My house, I cured

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:08.710
them. But he became completely bankrupt, his
wife was completely ruined. They got cured,

01:06:08.839 --> 01:06:15.450
no doubt, then he went to South Africa, now
he is there, he is writing this book. And

01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:22.299
when they wanted to fight the case, the TM
managed, because it was in Scotland, managed

01:06:22.299 --> 01:06:27.910
the magistrate, because they have lots of
money. Here also, I feel, they have told the

01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:32.190
newspapers not to publish anything about us.

01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:37.849
Everywhere I go they are there just to stop
My work because, you see, after all, it’s

01:06:37.849 --> 01:06:44.109
their earnings are killed by that. But the
last thing now they have started, is Ayurveda.

01:06:44.109 --> 01:06:49.890
Ayurveda, you don’t need TM for that, anybody
can do Ayurveda, what is the need, what is

01:06:49.890 --> 01:06:56.130
the need to have an agency of these people?
But it’s a fact, and they know that I know

01:06:56.130 --> 01:07:00.970
all their secrets, so they are very much against
Me, doesn’t matter, all of them are against

01:07:00.970 --> 01:07:05.549
Me, naturally, but they are not against each
other. Like Christ has said that “the house

01:07:05.549 --> 01:07:12.549
of Satan will not speak against itself”,
so this is TM. I am sorry that you’ve been

01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:22.470
to TM. Of course, despite that, now we know
how to manage even TM, most of it we can manage.

01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:26.079
What else, you’ve been to Rajneesh also?
[SOMEBODY FROM THE AUDIENCE ANSWERS, SOUNDS

01:07:26.079 --> 01:07:31.890
LIKE: I wouldn’t say that, Shri Mataji.]
But one thing is definite that you are all

01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:38.890
seekers, otherwise you could not go to these
people. So is My duty that you should get

01:07:40.009 --> 01:07:47.009
your Realization, I am duty bound, it’s
My privilege because you are seekers. I have

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:53.309
to give you Realization. Whatever you might
have done, forget it and forgive them! What

01:07:53.309 --> 01:07:53.559
else?

01:07:53.509 --> 01:07:56.009
QUESTION: Shri Mataji, this [SOUNDS LIKE:
person OR question says OR said?], “[UNAUDIBLE]

01:07:56.009 --> 01:07:58.519
incurable diseases [SOUNDS LIKE: are unquestionably?]
everywhere. [SOUNDS LIKE: How this come about,

01:07:58.519 --> 01:08:05.519
and how is Sahaja Yoga against such problems?]

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:14.960
SHRI MATAJI: I must say, Aids patients have
been cured with Sahaja Yoga. I must say, it’s

01:08:16.770 --> 01:08:23.690
a fact, no doubt. What we can do in this country,
I don’t know, I have no idea, because I

01:08:23.690 --> 01:08:30.690
don’t want to get arrested. But in England
“alternate medicines” are allowed and

01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:38.300
if people could reach England, we might be
able to help them.

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:45.300
QUESTION: This [SOUNDS LIKE: person OR question?]
asks: How does one overcome a lifetime of

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:54.090
bad habits and how [SOUNDS LIKE: can it be
renewed on a daily basis of our seeking?]

01:08:54.090 --> 01:08:58.730
SHRI MATAJI: I have already told you that
when the light comes in, you just become so

01:08:58.730 --> 01:09:05.730
powerful, so confident of yourself that all
bad habits stop on. Of course, just after

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:10.280
Realization, say, you get your Realization,
that doesn’t mean you become a great saint.

01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:17.280
You have to fix yourself properly, in American
language, “you have to fix your Yoga.”

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:22.970
Unless and until that is done, still you are
vulnerable, you must fix it up.

01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:29.630
QUESTION: This [SOUNDS LIKE: person OR question?]
says: Creative energy has a great power. How

01:09:29.630 --> 01:09:35.090
can we utilize [SOUNDS LIKE: their channels
OR and channalize this power,] Shri Mataji,

01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:35.850
creative energy?

01:09:35.850 --> 01:09:37.370
SHRI MATAJI: What’s it?

01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:43.070
QUESTION: Creative energy. How can we use
this power, how can we [SOUNDS LIKE: channelize

01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.460
it?]?

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:49.770
SHRI MATAJI: You get the state, you become
that. I told you, the Swadisthana, the Swadisthana

01:09:49.770 --> 01:09:55.480
gets nourished, and you don’t know from
where you get your ideas. Now, here it is

01:09:55.480 --> 01:10:02.480
an architect, he should tell his own experience,
what he is doing now, and what he was doing

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:09.680
before. The ideas start pouring into you because
they come from this Swadisthana chakra, and

01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:12.440
the Swadisthana chakra gets nourishment.

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:19.440
QUESTION: This [SOUNDS LIKE: person OR question?]
asks: How can this process be used to address

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:25.040
the problems of the [SOUNDS LIKE: hopeless
OR homeless, racial prejudices, joblessness,

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.810
and hopeless problem], Shri Mataji?

01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:32.520
SHRI MATAJI: Hopeless? [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]
You see, racialism comes from ignorance, complete

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:38.710
ignorance. We do not know that God has created
all of us just the same, we smile the same

01:10:38.710 --> 01:10:43.540
way, laugh the same way, cry the same way.
Nobody tells that the Americans should laugh

01:10:43.540 --> 01:10:50.540
like this and the Indian should laugh like
that, we yawn the same way, we sleep the same

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:57.210
way, wake up the same way. Now, we are differently
made, God has made us to create beauty, you

01:10:57.210 --> 01:11:00.660
see, if there is [SANSKRIT WORD, SOUNDS LIKE:
VAICHITRA] as they say in Sanskrit, if there

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:07.170
is variety, then there is beauty. So variety
is created. God created only one world, He

01:11:07.170 --> 01:11:12.750
didn’t know that we’ll make so many out
of it, we have done it, but once this ignorance

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:19.750
goes away, because Spirit is a universal being,
then you become a universal being. Like yesterday

01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:28.850
only, I told you that when I went to Russia,
twenty-five Germans rushed to Russia to give

01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:33.270
Realization to Russians. And the way they
[SOUNDS LIKE: impressed] and the way they

01:11:33.270 --> 01:11:40.270
loved them, I really, I tell you, I felt so
happy and tears started rolling My eyes, such

01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:50.760
a joy! Imagine, the Russians, and we have
these Germans who are so gentle, they are

01:11:53.210 --> 01:11:59.530
the gentlest people, you won’t call them
“Germans” anymore. That's what happens

01:11:59.530 --> 01:12:06.530
because basically you are that, and you become
a universal being, and you follow the religion,

01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:13.160
which is innate within you, which makes you
an universal being. You don't become any Christian,

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:18.660
Hindu, Muslim, nothing, you are a human being,
and you become a universal human being, and

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:25.660
you respect all of them, not one. What is
the next problem here? Joblessness. The joblessness

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:39.100
also, I must tell you, that in London, it’s
so many jobless people there are, but is difficult

01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:46.890
to find a Sahaja Yogi who is a jobless there,
difficult, they just get jobs, and because

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.640
they are doing the job of God also.

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:54.590
QUESTION: [UNAUDIBLE] hopelessness, Shri Mataji.

01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:59.900
SHRI MATAJI: Hopeless, that is not, it’s
very hopeful.

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:06.900
QUESTION: This [SOUNDS LIKE: person OR question?]
asks, Shri Mataji: What has the potential

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:14.580
to make [UNAUDIBLE]? Would you still recommend
to give up material wealth to get to reality,

01:13:15.170 --> 01:13:21.280
or is it better to make the money and give
it to charity, [SOUNDS LIKE: do OR is??] that

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:22.270
helping people?

01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:26.480
SHRI MATAJI: You see, if you are making lots
of money or [SOUNDS LIKE: others OR either?]

01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:33.480
making no money, whatsoever. In Sahaja Yoga
you make money, alright, but there you do

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:39.190
not cling to it, you do not hanker after it.
Now, there was a lady here in San Francisco.

01:13:39.190 --> 01:13:45.120
She was running a store, and when she got
Realization, she said that, “I used to meticulously

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:49.990
remember this thing I have got, that I have
got, this is bought, this is sold and all

01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:56.990
those things, I’ve forgotten all that, but
now I am making a big profit.” I said, “Then

01:13:57.370 --> 01:14:04.370
it is alright”. Money also is one of the
blessings of God. As Shri Krishna said, “Yoga

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:11.040
[Sanskrit WORD, SOUNDS LIKE: KSHEMA MAHAMYAM?]”,
[SOUNDS LIKE: “Kshema”] means “benevolence

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:17.510
in every way”. So, once you get your Yoga,
then you get that, not before. [SOUNDS LIKE:

01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:23.020
Yoga Kshema?], first Yoga, and then the [Kshema?],
[Kshema?] is the benevolence, so all kinds

01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:28.910
of benevolence come,you’re your mad race
about money finishes off. But you get money,

01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:33.400
alright, and there is a complete satisfaction
out of it.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:40.400
QUESTION: The second part of this question
[SOUNDS LIKE: You have just answered, but

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:49.380
the first part is: How are you and Sahaja
Yoga supported if nobody is accepted for the

01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:49.630
practice?]

01:14:49.530 --> 01:14:50.480
SHRI MATAJI:: Supported? In what way?

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:51.540
QUESTION: Means, if nobody is taking…

01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:52.730
SHRI MATAJI: Financially?

01:14:52.730 --> 01:14:53.520
QUESTION: Yes.

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:57.380
SHRI MATAJI: I mean, I told you, now, that
in the beginning, of course, I used to pay

01:14:57.380 --> 01:15:03.170
for everything, no doubt. Even now in so many
places, for Russia, I have to pay Myself.

01:15:03.170 --> 01:15:06.210
For the
time being, is alright, My husband is very

01:15:06.210 --> 01:15:10.860
generous, and he is an Indian, so he thinks
he is doing some God’s work, you see, [SOUNDS

01:15:10.860 --> 01:15:15.750
LIKE: by OR buy?] that and he will get some
good blessings, so he’s a sensible man.

01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:22.750
[LAUGHTER] He doesn't mind if I am [UNAUDIBLE
– LIKE: these bank], he doesn’t mind.

01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:29.640
And also now, you see, all these things like
hall and all that, these people get it, and

01:15:29.640 --> 01:15:36.520
everything is arranged by them nowadays. But
as I told you, that for Realization you cannot

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:42.060
pay, you cannot pay Me, you cannot purchase
Me, you cannot, and you cannot purchase your

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:49.060
Self Realization, your ascent. But it’s
not much, you see, for this hall, how much

01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:57.350
you need? Don't need much money, that's all.
Either you will pay thousands and thousands

01:16:03.060 --> 01:16:09.020
of rupees and pounds without asking, and if
somebody has to pay even for the hall, they

01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:12.270
will say, “How do you get this money?”
I mean, of course, for the hall you have to

01:16:12.270 --> 01:16:16.900
pay, you don't expect Me to pay for it, but
I did. I am saying, I did pay, but now they

01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:22.690
feel ashamed that I should pay for the hall,
they paid because they are also concerned

01:16:22.690 --> 01:16:28.220
and you will also pay, I am sure. You would
not like Me to pay for these halls, as well

01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:35.220
as for everything, for your food, or for everything,
do you expect Me to do that? Not at all. So

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:43.520
for your salvation you need not pay, but for
your hall you have to pay, there is no harm,

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:48.100
but I don't keep accounts. I don't know how
they paid what they, I have no idea, I don't

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:52.580
understand accounts at all, so they do it,
everything, and they have to explain to you.

01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:56.280
I have nothing to do with [SOUNDS LIKE: them
OR that?]. It's a fact, I am telling you,

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.500
if it is wrong they should tell Me.

01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:04.500
QUESTION: Shri Mataji, this person asks: How
is Self Realization and God Realization [INAUDIBLE]?

01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:14.350
SHRI MATAJI: It’s again a futuristic question.
First, let us have the Self, as Buddha has

01:17:17.370 --> 01:17:23.060
said, and also as Mahavira has said, because
they thought if you talk of God Realization,

01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:29.940
people just start thinking they are God. The
difference between the two things is one,

01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:36.940
that first you get your Self Realization established,
means you understand your powers as Self,

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:43.500
then you try to understand God. And God Realization
is a situation in which you control so many

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:50.500
things automatically, automatically you control.
You don't have to bother and just control,

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:58.750
and you are amazed how even the elements are
controlled through your presence. But the

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:05.800
first is to know your Self, establish your
Self, know it well, master it and then think

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.960
of another thing.

01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:13.880
Part 3

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:19.160
QUESTION: The second question is: What are
the vibrations really and how do I read them

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.570
precisely, [SOUNDS LIKE: … without deception?]?

01:18:21.570 --> 01:18:27.690
SHRI MATAJI: Alright. First, as again I say,
first your Self Realization must be established

01:18:27.690 --> 01:18:33.290
and your Kundalini must be fixed properly.
And then, [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS TO SOME PEOPLE

01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:37.630
IN THE HALL: You can sit here, there are seats,
come along!] and then you start feeling the

01:18:37.630 --> 01:18:43.510
vibrations on your fingertips, first of all.
That you will feel now even. Then, they have

01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:50.510
marked them to show the centers, see one,
two, three, four, five, on your fingertips,

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:57.580
so you will know, which is the center that
is catching. If you know how to correct the

01:18:57.580 --> 01:19:01.920
center, then you can correct your center.
In the same way you can feel the centers of

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:08.250
others. Once you start feeling them properly,
you have to just know how to correct these

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:14.440
centers, finished. Then you’re alright and
it hardly takes one month, hardly takes one

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:16.040
month.

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:23.040
QUESTION: Shri Mataji, the next five questions
are all about different Gurus, [UNAUDIBLE]

01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:28.430
all about different ones.

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:29.870
SHRI MATAJI: Which ones?

01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:34.900
QUESTION: One is about [SOUNDS LIKE: Swami
Ram]. Do you believe in his teachings?

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:40.360
SHRI MATAJI: What is the use of teachings?
You have had many, you have had Christ, he

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:47.360
has given you the Bible, there is so many
we have had. Now, no more teachings, actualization,

01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:49.750
ask for actualization! What else?

01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:54.940
QUESTION: [UNAUDIBLE, SOUNDS LIKE: … Yogananda
and his teachings about Krija Yoga, which

01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:57.700
he said is the quickest technique for Self
Realization.]

01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:58.770
SHRI MATAJI: I said?

01:19:58.770 --> 01:19:59.560
QUESTION: No, Yogananda.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:06.560
SHRI MATAJI: Oh, he might have said it, but
nobody has got it so far. [LAUGHTER] Now,

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:13.260
what is Kriya Yoga? Sahaja Yoga is Akriya,
“Kriya” means [SHRI MATAJI ASKS ASIDE:

01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:20.260
What you call “Kriya”, in English? – ANSWER:
Action.] “action”, “Kriya” is “action”,

01:20:20.290 --> 01:20:26.290
and Sahaja Yoga “Akriya”, “no action”.
Now, Kriya Yoga is like this. Yesterday, I

01:20:26.290 --> 01:20:33.290
explained to some people who asked Me that
when your car starts, I mean, when it is ignited,

01:20:35.410 --> 01:20:41.030
then automatically all the machinery starts
working, automatically. You don't have to

01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:47.460
move anything, it’s all built in, but Kriya
Yoga is this that you don't start the car,

01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:53.270
you don't start the Kundalini, but you start
moving the wheels. First time when I came,

01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:56.650
I was very shocked. Now they have stopped
all that nonsense because they think there

01:20:56.650 --> 01:21:01.730
was some sort of a [SOUNDS LIKE: … stitcher?]
on that. They used to cut the tongue, this

01:21:01.730 --> 01:21:06.850
thread of the tongue, and I saw some Indian
doctors with their tongues wagging like that.

01:21:06.850 --> 01:21:13.070
I said, “What has happened?” They couldn't
speak. So they told Me that, “We have cut

01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:20.070
our threads because we have to push back our
tongue and get to the [SOUNDS LIKE: catchery?]

01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:26.270
condition.” Now, [SOUNDS LIKE: catchery?]
is a simple thing, which is described, of

01:21:26.270 --> 01:21:32.410
course, is a part of Sahaja Yoga only, that
when the Kundalini rises, the centers, first

01:21:32.410 --> 01:21:39.410
of all, allow the Kundalini to rise and then
they augment. Then again they relax, the higher

01:21:42.850 --> 01:21:47.660
ones, and then they augment because they have
to stop the Kundalini from falling down. [SOUNDS

01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:52.120
LIKE: Is OR It’s?] simple thing like that.
In the same way, when it reaches Vishuddhi

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:59.120
chakra, here also, what happens when Kundalini
rises higher, there is a big augmentation

01:21:59.450 --> 01:22:03.330
that takes place and the tongue is pulled
inside, which you don't feel normally, you

01:22:03.330 --> 01:22:08.840
won't feel because the Kundalini rises like
a jet these days. So, what they did [SOUNDS

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:13.790
LIKE: was/which/with?] to cut the tongue and
put it there. But the Kundalini is sitting

01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:20.790
in the sacrum bone only, what’s the use?
So, the whole Kriya Yoga is like moving your

01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:28.930
wheels, while the car has not started. Is
very easy to talk of these things because

01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:38.080
in India these books are available, you can
read them. I know of people, there was an

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:42.440
actress who came to My program when I came
in 1971. There were so many people who came

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:46.890
to My program and also Dr. [SOUNDS LIKE: JODRY?]
told Me that, “You better get it copyright.”

01:22:46.890 --> 01:22:52.790
I said, “There is no copyright needed for
this kind of a thing, it’s alright.” And

01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:57.180
they are using My words, they are using the
word Kundalini, there is Maha Yoga, they are

01:22:57.180 --> 01:23:03.490
using the words like [SOUNDS LIKE: Self Realization
OR self realizing?], everything, I’m doing

01:23:03.490 --> 01:23:10.490
nothing about it, just making money. Sorry,
what can I do about it? It is for you to decide.

01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:19.350
It is the actualization, which you should
ask, and this is what is this Kriya Yoga.

01:23:20.670 --> 01:23:25.380
I don't know why people are so impressed by
his book. What has he written there? He went

01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:31.010
to Himalayas, he met one Guru, so what? Anybody
can do that, what is so great? What has he

01:23:31.010 --> 01:23:38.010
[SOUNDS LIKE: written?]? Why should it impress
people? What has he done? Nothing. They have,

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:43.520
of course, got a big place where they live
and all that, that's all. But I don't think

01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:49.410
anybody has got Realization from them, they
cannot! First, the Kundalini has to be awakened.

01:23:49.410 --> 01:23:56.410
QUESTION: Shri Mataji, this question asks:
What is your relation to Babaji?

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:03.900
SHRI MATAJI: Who is this? Nothing, I am absolutely
against him, that's all. It’s another hooks.

01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:10.900
These are all hooks, believe Me, they are
all hooks! Ramana Maharshi was the realized

01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:20.210
soul, no doubt. Shirdi Sai Nath was a realized
soul. Those who were realized, I’ll say

01:24:20.210 --> 01:24:26.210
yes, those who are not, I will definitely
say, “They are not.” I have to say that.

01:24:26.210 --> 01:24:33.210
This Babaji’s [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] experiences
of these funny people, it’s a long story.

01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:50.660
This Lahiri Baba, Lahiri, Lahiri Baba, the
Guru of this Yogananda, is his grandson, he

01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:55.990
came to Me and he said that, “I joined this
Kriya Yoga, I did all kinds of things, and

01:24:55.990 --> 01:25:02.120
I never got any Realization or anything, so
I was so fed up. Then I went to this Krishnamurti.

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:07.740
I was with him, but then I started speaking
like Krishnamurti, just like his voice and

01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:12.310
everything, I started speaking, doing all
the drama of Krishnamurti and everything.

01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:16.870
And then I got a fright, one day I saw myself
in the mirror. I said, ‘Oh God, I am becoming

01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:21.200
Krishnamurti, and I am just giving lectures,
that’s all.’ So, Mother, I’ve come to

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:23.920
you, [SOUNDS LIKE: so OR now?] please now
give me Realization!” You will be surprised,

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:28.680
till today, I’ve not been able to do that!
This one person I have not been able to do

01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:33.050
that. I don't know what all he has done. I
told him, “What all you have done, you tell

01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:37.470
Me!” And he was telling Me so many things
about this Lahiri Baba and his Babaji. I said,

01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:44.470
“Whow, please, all these things they do
to you? Horrible!” So much they have harmed

01:25:49.870 --> 01:25:53.210
him, this man, he is the grandson of Lahiri
Baba.

01:25:53.210 --> 01:26:00.210
QUESTION: Shri Mataji, this question asks:
What do you think of Guru Nanak [SOUNDS LIKE:

01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:03.010
… and Guru…?]?

01:26:03.010 --> 01:26:10.010
SHRI MATAJI: Guru Nanak, of course. I mean,
Guru Nanak was the incarnation of the Primordial

01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:18.180
Master, no doubt about it, no doubt. He talked
of unity, he was the incarnation of the Primordial

01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:25.420
Master who has incarnated many a times as
Moses, as Abraham, and also he has been Mohammed

01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:32.920
Sahib, and then Guru Nanak, no doubt about
it.

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:37.610
QUESTION: This question asks: Is it possible
that the Russians are open to Self Realization

01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:42.160
because of the influence of the Matreya there?

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:45.520
SHRI MATAJI: Of the?

01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:46.740
QUESTION: Matreya.

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:52.400
SHRI MATAJI: Maitreya! I don't know about
they know about Maitreya or not, is all a

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:57.160
Buddhist idea of Maitreya. How will you recognize
the Maitreya also, how will you recognize

01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:04.160
the Holy Ghost? If you are still waiting for
Maitreya, then, I think, you are sadly mistaken.

01:27:07.330 --> 01:27:13.250
QUESTION: This questions asks: Can a person
achieve out-of-body experience through Sahaja

01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:13.740
Yoga?

01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:15.460
SHRI MATAJI: What experience?

01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:16.560
QUESTION: Out-of-body.

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:23.560
SHRI MATAJI: No, not at all, that's horrible!
Why do you want to go out of your body? [LAUGHTER]

01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:34.030
Going out of body is achieved through possession!
You know, there are children killed in the

01:27:35.170 --> 01:27:40.340
beds, have you heard of such a thing here?
I don't know, but in Switzerland. Children

01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:46.460
are sleeping in their beds because their parents
don't keep the children with them, and the

01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:52.790
children, they die. That is what is happening
because of this body business. The spirits,

01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:59.790
they come out, and if they go out of the body,
then these spirits can take away another spirit

01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:07.820
also, and never return them. Is the worst
thing, is to become possessed like this. I

01:28:11.190 --> 01:28:15.610
[SOUNDS LIKE: met OR had?] three American
journalists long time back, they came to see

01:28:15.610 --> 01:28:22.610
Me. And they told Me that, “Mother, we want
to have a special capacity to know what is

01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:30.860
happening everywhere and without being there,
how can we do it?” I said, “Who told you

01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:36.550
that I can do that?” So they told Me a name
of a journalist, another one. I said, “He

01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:42.740
told you this? I was the one who cured him
of this disease, and he told you these things

01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:49.740
that I will make you like that?” That fellow
would disappear from his body and would go

01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:55.360
somewhere else, and hear something else and
used to publish in the newspaper, which was

01:28:55.360 --> 01:29:00.750
true, but his wife was so shocked by that,
she brought him, and he said, “Mother, please

01:29:00.750 --> 01:29:05.380
make me one person, I don't want to have this
nonsensical thing!” She said, “One day,

01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:12.280
he will be dead.”. I said, ”He will be,
one day, he will be lost.” And these three

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:19.150
people wanted to be like him, whom I cured,
to get this disease. It’s a horrible state,

01:29:19.150 --> 01:29:24.840
one should never, never, think of that! Why
do they want to run away from the present?

01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:31.840
Present is the most beautiful thing, is the
most beautiful thing! Present is the reality,

01:29:36.610 --> 01:29:42.940
the past is finished and future doesn’t
exist, but if you can be in the present, nothing

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:44.940
like it!

01:29:44.940 --> 01:29:51.810
QUESTION: Shri Mataji, this question asks:
What about vegetarianism.

01:29:51.810 --> 01:29:58.810
SHRI MATAJI: There are no isms in Sahaja Yoga,
no isms at all. Is in the Bible, is written,

01:29:59.730 --> 01:30:06.260
all beings are created for you, for your use,
and smaller animals than you. Those people

01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:12.770
who need protein should eat. Now, for example,
in Greenland, people cannot have any vegetables

01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:19.770
at all, so are they sinners? But, I would
say, Americans should take more vegetarianism,

01:30:22.780 --> 01:30:29.780
is good because they have eaten too much of
meats, so give a balance. But there is no

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:34.620
at hard and fast food about it except that
you should not eat any animal which is bigger

01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:41.620
than you, because they have a bigger musculature
cell, and those cells can harm your teethes,

01:30:42.430 --> 01:30:49.430
can harm your intestines. But smaller animals
are to be, if it is needed, must be eaten.

01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:57.110
If it is not for Indians must eat meat, otherwise
already they are such useless people, they

01:30:57.110 --> 01:31:04.110
are good for nothing, they can’t even hold
a gun, leave alone a revolver. If you people

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:11.240
go there with one revolver, the whole village
will jump into the well, such cowards! So

01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:20.460
for them it is necessary to eat meat, but
they are vegetarians. But not in India, everybody

01:31:20.650 --> 01:31:27.650
is not, now, it is better, but what I am saying,
it is a very logical thing and is to be understood,

01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:36.240
what sort of a person you are? If you are
a left-sided person, then you must take proteins,

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:42.520
but if you are a right-sided person then you
must take to vegetables and to carbohydrates.

01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:49.200
Is question of proteins, carbohydrates, and
fats, is not a question of animals and that.

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:56.200
Do you mean by saving chickens I can give
them Realization? [LAUGHTER] And this nonsense

01:31:57.480 --> 01:32:04.390
of vegetarianism has gone so far, so far now.
Among Chinese, I don't if you know, there

01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:10.070
are many here, because they are moneymakers.
Chinese, these Chinese have started a funny

01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:16.130
type of vegetarianism, I think long time back.
First of all there was one [SOUNDS LIKE: Nemi]

01:32:16.130 --> 01:32:23.130
Nath who was one of their [SOUNDS LIKE: Hankaras?],
who was a cousin of Shri Krishna, who saw

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:30.400
many dead things in his marriage. So he felt
that, I mean, he felt, sometimes you do feel

01:32:32.260 --> 01:32:36.190
that so many animals had died and all that,
we call it [SOUNDS LIKE: Tubarati?]. So he

01:32:36.190 --> 01:32:43.190
started vegetarianism. But now the Jains do
not allow any insects to die, even the bugs,

01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:52.010
the mosquitoes, viruses, anything should not
be dead, but they’ll kill human beings,

01:32:52.010 --> 01:32:56.620
alright, not animals [LAUGHTER], so ridiculous
it is.

01:32:56.620 --> 01:33:03.620
QUESTION: Shri Mataji, this person says that
they have skin cancer and wants to know how

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:14.400
they will be cured? This person has skin cancer
and they want to know how they can get rid

01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:15.570
of it?

01:33:15.570 --> 01:33:20.590
SHRI MATAJI: Cancer, skin cancer, it comes
from liver. If your liver is cured, you can

01:33:20.590 --> 01:33:27.590
be, very easily. We have a liver diet, which
you have to take. You have to get your liver

01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:32.820
cured, which can be easily cured. Work it
out, have faith! You see, because you don't

01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:37.740
have to pay, that's why people don't do it.
I have seen it, they don't do it seriously.

01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:44.740
It’s like this, if you pay for something,
then you get bound, that’s mentality. Like

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:50.510
yesterday, as I was telling you that if you
have paid for a play, and the play may the

01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:55.350
worst possible, [INAUDIBLE] we have paid for
it, so go through it. But you don't have to

01:33:55.350 --> 01:34:02.350
pay in Sahaja Yoga, so people don't take it
seriously. Asthmas have been cured, livers

01:34:02.410 --> 01:34:07.790
have been cured, cancer, this skin cancer
is no problem at all. But whatever they tell

01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:11.580
you, you have to listen to them and work it
out. Within one month, you will be find out

01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:18.580
everything will be cured. There has to be
commitment about it, you must be committed

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:25.230
to yourself that “I am going to get alright!”
You decide on that point and it will work

01:34:25.230 --> 01:34:32.230
out. “I am going to be a Yogi.” You will
be, but there should be some commitment.

01:34:33.530 --> 01:34:40.530
QUESTION: Shri Mataji, the last question was:
How we know if we are in our Spirit and following

01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:56.050
our inner guidance?

01:34:56.050 --> 01:35:03.050
SHRI MATAJI: Now his question is: How we are
to know that we are the Spirit? Now, we become

01:35:05.180 --> 01:35:12.180
the Spirit. First of all, when we become the
Spirit, we start feeling the cool breeze all

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:19.980
around us. First thing. Secondly, then we
start feeling our centers on our fingertips.

01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:25.690
Like, supposing, I get American money and
I have never known what American money is,

01:35:25.690 --> 01:35:30.540
supposing, then I have to go to the market
to find out what it means. In the same way,

01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:36.700
you start using your hands, as I told you,
the captain of the ship, and you will feel

01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:43.650
the vibrations of another person. You ask
that person, now, supposing, you feel here

01:35:43.650 --> 01:35:49.700
some heat or some sort of burning, you ask
him, “Is something wrong with your throat?”

01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:56.700
“How do you know?”, he will say. You can
feel the cancer, you can feel everything on

01:35:57.990 --> 01:36:04.990
your fingertips, you can diagnose. So, you
have to use your hands, that’s how you will

01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:12.420
know. But then you start curing yourself,
and you start getting feeling better. Then,

01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:21.120
when you become the master of this art, you
start curing others. Not only physically,

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:28.120
mentally, emotionally, every way, you feel
such a balance, such a joy, and such peace

01:36:28.690 --> 01:36:34.550
within yourself. There is not talking about
peace because I know, because I’ve been

01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:40.320
with such people who have “Foundation of
Peace”, and some people have got Nobel Prize

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:46.320
in peace and so hot tempered that you can’t
sit near them for five minutes, they emit

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:53.320
horrible heat like a heater! I really tell
you, horrible, and they have got Nobel prizes

01:36:53.460 --> 01:36:58.360
in peace. I mean, I don't know how people
have given them for peace? At least they could

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:05.360
have given them for violence, but not for
peace, but there is. So, you really feel peaceful

01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:11.030
within yourself. Now, you won’t believe,
I am sixty-seven years of age, and if you

01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:15.280
see My itinerary, you will [SOUNDS LIKE: fait
OR faint OR faith?] the way I travel, all

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:19.130
the year around I’m practically traveling,
[SOUNDS LIKE: but I am quite in peace OR I

01:37:19.130 --> 01:37:22.060
am fine?] with Myself. They say, “How do
you manage”? I said, “Why? I am there,

01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:28.910
when I am traveling, I know I am there. So,
what is there to be thinking about, just I

01:37:28.910 --> 01:37:32.440
am there, that's all.” “So, but you think
you are traveling?” I say, “I don’t

01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:38.070
that way. I am just sitting there, I am not
traveling, it’s the aero plane that’s

01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:43.730
traveling.” And that’s how, you just,
you are at peace with yourself, you are with

01:37:43.730 --> 01:37:50.730
peace with everybody else and, I mean, it’s
another personality that evolves out of you.

01:37:54.600 --> 01:38:01.600
So, that’s how you know you are that. I
mean, first of all, people don't even believe

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:09.320
that the cool breeze is coming to your fingertips,
is really, they think, there must be the window,

01:38:09.650 --> 01:38:14.560
there must be an air conditioner. Some people
go home, close all the doors and start seeing.

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:21.560
It’s true, but then they realize.
So you have to spend it and experiment with

01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:27.460
it, and then you definitely start believing
in it that you are the Spirit, and then you

01:38:27.460 --> 01:38:34.460
understand your powers. Alright, you can raise
the Kundalini of a person, you can, and you

01:38:38.440 --> 01:38:43.960
will be amazed that how you can do it! In
the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, we had about

01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:49.000
twelve people and they would not put their
hands. They said, “No, how can we do, we

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.530
don't have anything, they were very diffident
about it?” So, one day, there was a lecture

01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:59.540
arranged in a place where I had to go in [SOUNDS
LIKE: Nashik?] and I had to go by car. And

01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:03.990
luckily, the car failed and in India, if your
car fails, you are stranded, there is nothing

01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:09.620
else that you can do. And these people thought
that one hour has passed, Mother has not come

01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:13.730
and all these people are now going to beat
us. So they started giving them Realization,

01:39:13.730 --> 01:39:20.730
and they were amazed, they had the power.
They had the power, and that’s how they

01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:27.940
discovered. So you have to be bold about it.
You are that, I assure you! Only thing, you

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:32.410
must claim what you are.

01:39:32.410 --> 01:39:37.760
I think, we are finished with the things now,
let’s have our Realization!

01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.910
Part 4
That will take about ten minutes and will

01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:48.910
be a good idea to know your self. If you want
to be out for about five minutes, you can

01:39:57.780 --> 01:40:02.080
go out. Then we can start it, if you think
that we can give five minutes to you, just

01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:09.080
to move out a little bit – and then come
back.

01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:30.300
Part 5
Before we start, at the outset, I would like

01:41:53.530 --> 01:42:00.530
to tell you that there are two conditions
we have to fulfill. The first condition is,

01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:10.240
you have not to feel guilty at all, at all!
That means, you have to completely forget

01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:22.420
the past and forgive yourself. These are only
mental conceptions, why do you judge yourself?

01:42:26.550 --> 01:42:33.550
Your Kundalini will judge you, so please,
just say that, “I’m not guilty at all.”

01:42:42.570 --> 01:42:47.630
Don't try to remember each and everything
that has made you feel guilty, but just in

01:42:47.630 --> 01:42:54.630
general, “I am not guilty at all. I have
not done anything wrong, whatsoever, I am

01:42:57.850 --> 01:43:04.850
a human being and I have a right to become
a Yogi, I have every right.” Alright.

01:43:08.570 --> 01:43:15.570
And the second one is that you have to forgive
everyone, in general again. Some will say,

01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:26.840
“It’s difficult to forgive”, but whether
you forgive or you don't forgive, what do

01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:33.780
we do? Logically we don't do anything, but
when we don't forgive, then you play into

01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:40.530
wrong hands. The people who have tortured
you, have troubled you or made you unhappy,

01:43:40.530 --> 01:43:47.530
when you do not forgive them, they are very
happy, but you become miserable. So, in general,

01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:56.780
you forgive everyone, in general. Again, you
don't have to think, but who are the people

01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:04.440
who have troubled you, but in general you
forgive everyone. This is a very important

01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:12.180
part of Sahaja Yoga because the center which
is the optic chiasm, as I said, the gate,

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:21.160
is very constricted, and unless and [MISSING:
until??] you forgive everyone, I tell you,

01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:30.680
this center won’t open out. And you don't
want to miss out your Self-Realization for

01:44:31.170 --> 01:44:36.220
these nonsensical people, those who have tortured
you all your life, and now also they are standing

01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:43.220
in the way. So, just forgive them, all of
them, together, these are the two conditions

01:44:48.450 --> 01:44:55.450
we have to fulfill. First, is not to feel
guilty at all, and second is to forgive everyone

01:44:56.530 --> 01:45:03.530
in general. Just to say, I forgive everyone,
finished, nothing to do, just finished. Now,

01:45:11.410 --> 01:45:18.410
we have to use the Mother Earth and we have
to use our left hand and right hand, the left

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:28.800
hand is the one, which is the power of desire,
while Kundalini is the power of pure desire.

01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:37.940
The left hand is the power of desire, and
the right hand is the power of action. Now,

01:45:38.010 --> 01:45:43.240
here we don't do much action, but we can nourish
our centers, and also by this you will know

01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:50.240
how to later on raise your Kundalini again
and again. So, in this program, we can combine

01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:58.280
both things together in a very simple manner,
[SOUNDS LIKE: it’s OR is??] extremely simple.

01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:04.490
So first of all, we’ll have to take out
our shoes to take help from the Mother Earth,

01:46:04.490 --> 01:46:11.490
you can keep your socks, but shoes should
better [SOUNDS LIKE: get out??].

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Now, to put your left-hand towards Me, can
put it on your lap, if you want to. This is

01:46:30.850 --> 01:46:37.850
symbolic that you have the desire, just symbolic
that you have a desire to get your Self-Realization.

01:46:40.530 --> 01:46:47.530
So please, put your left-hand on your lap
all the time, constantly, and now we have

01:46:49.410 --> 01:46:56.410
to use the right hand to nourish our centers.
So first, I’ll show you [SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS

01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:05.760
TO A YOGI: Dave?, will you come up, please!],
he will show you how to put your hands, this

01:47:07.490 --> 01:47:14.490
is all to been seen first of all, and later
on you have to close your eyes, and then we’ll

01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:21.870
work it out. First, you have to put your hand
on your heart, on your heart because in the

01:47:22.220 --> 01:47:29.220
heart resides the Spirit. Now, if you are
the Spirit, you are also your Master, and

01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:41.010
this power of Mastery is within you, and the
center of Master is on the left-hand side

01:47:41.890 --> 01:47:48.890
of your stomach in the upper part or you can
call the abdomen. We are only working on the

01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:55.600
left-hand side with the right hand, so we
put our hand on the upper portion of our abdomen

01:47:55.600 --> 01:48:02.600
on the left-hand side, please. Now, this is
the center of our Mastery. Then we put our

01:48:07.090 --> 01:48:12.950
hand in the lower position of the abdomen,
in the lower position of the abdomen on the

01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:19.440
left-hand side, now this is the center of
pure knowledge. Pure knowledge means the one

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:26.440
that manifests on your central nervous system.
Is not the knowledge of your reading or your

01:48:28.590 --> 01:48:34.640
intellect, but is the knowledge that manifests
on your central nervous system, is the pure

01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:41.640
knowledge. Then your raise your hand again
on the upper portion of the abdomen on the

01:48:42.010 --> 01:48:49.010
left-hand side, and then on your heart, then
in the corner of your neck and your head [SOUNDS

01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:58.770
LIKE: turn it OR took him OR it??] backwards
as much as possible, and then turn your head

01:48:58.770 --> 01:49:05.770
to your right. This is the center that’s
get caught up when you feel guilt and gives

01:49:12.270 --> 01:49:18.990
you lots of problems. This is the worst center
and I see, today also, you all are catching

01:49:18.990 --> 01:49:24.840
it, so at the very outset, just know that
you are not guilty at all, please believe

01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:29.530
Me, you [SOUNDS LIKE: are not guilty OR have
not guilt], it’s your own mental idea. You

01:49:29.530 --> 01:49:36.530
are not at all guilty, you have nothing done
wrong! Alright. Then you’ll take your right

01:49:36.850 --> 01:49:43.850
hand on top of your forehead across like this,
and put down your head, and press it on both

01:49:45.570 --> 01:49:52.570
the sides. Now, this is the center where you
have to forgive everyone. Now, take back your

01:49:58.220 --> 01:50:04.210
hand on the backside of your head, and push
back your head as much as possible, resting

01:50:04.210 --> 01:50:11.210
on the hand and here, for your own satisfaction,
you have to ask forgiveness from this Divine

01:50:14.490 --> 01:50:21.490
power, just for your satisfaction, so that
you don’t feel guilty at all. Now, you have

01:50:21.890 --> 01:50:28.890
to stretch your palm fully, fully, stretch,
and the center of your palm you have to put

01:50:30.370 --> 01:50:37.370
on top of the fontanel bone area, which was
a soft area when you were a child. Here, now,

01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:45.570
put on your head and press back your fingers
as far as possible and move your hand, move

01:50:50.610 --> 01:50:57.610
your hand in the clockwise manner. Put down
your head and move your hand in clockwise

01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:05.940
manner, very slowly, so that you move the
scalp with a pressure, with a pressure, push

01:51:07.150 --> 01:51:14.150
back your fingers, so you put a proper pressure
on, seven times, clockwise. That’s all we

01:51:21.460 --> 01:51:28.460
have to do, that’s all. Now, please put
your feet on both the, little away from each

01:51:31.300 --> 01:51:37.860
other because these are two powers, as I told
you. Now, put the left hand towards Me. You

01:51:37.860 --> 01:51:44.030
may to take out your spectacles because when
you close your eyes, you shouldn’t open

01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:51.030
them till I tell you, and it’s better to
take out your spectacles. Now, please, close

01:51:54.490 --> 01:52:01.280
your eyes. You should be very pleasantly [SOUNDS
LIKE: placed towards?] yourself because you

01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:06.830
are going to enter into to the kingdom of
God.

01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:13.830
Now, put your right hand on your heart, please.
Here, you have to ask Me a very fundamental

01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:22.610
question, three times. You may call Me “Shri
Mataji” or you can call Me “Mother”,

01:52:22.610 --> 01:52:29.610
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask in your
heart, not loudly, three times. “Mother,

01:52:36.300 --> 01:52:43.300
am I the Spirit?” If you are the Spirit,
you are your Master. So now, please take your

01:52:52.270 --> 01:52:59.270
right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen,
press it hard, and here ask a question, with

01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:10.520
deliberation you must ask, another question.
“Mother, am I my own Master?”, or “Mother,

01:53:11.620 --> 01:53:18.620
am I my own Guru?” Ask this question, three
times.

01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:35.480
Now, I must tell you that I respect your freedom,
and the pure knowledge cannot be forced on

01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:47.400
you, so you have to ask for it. Now, please,
put your right hand in the lower portion of

01:53:49.890 --> 01:53:56.890
your abdomen on the left-hand side and press
it hard. And here you have to say six times

01:53:58.670 --> 01:54:05.670
because this center has got six petals, “Mother,
please give me pure knowledge.” You have

01:54:06.930 --> 01:54:11.840
to ask for it, I cannot force on you, and
don't’ feel guilty. I feel, you people are

01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:18.840
feeling guilty for everything. There is no
need to feel guilty at all. With full confidence

01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:25.940
you ask for pure knowledge, “Mother, please
give me pure knowledge.” You have to have

01:54:28.130 --> 01:54:33.670
full confidence in yourself. This is what
I have told you at the very outset that you

01:54:33.670 --> 01:54:40.670
all are capable of getting your Self-Realization.
So now, we have to nourish our upper centers

01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:47.990
with self-confidence because when you ask
for pure knowledge, the Kundalini has started

01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:56.500
its movement upward. Now raise your right
hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

01:54:56.500 --> 01:55:03.500
and press it hard on the left-hand side. Now,
here, with full confidence, you say ten times,

01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:12.480
“Mother, I am my own Master”, or say “Mother,
I am my own Guru.” Say ten times, with full

01:55:13.330 --> 01:55:20.330
confidence, which you are. I have told you
that the truth is that you are the pure Spirit.

01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:39.800
You are not this body, you are not this mind,
you are not this intellect, you are not these

01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:46.800
emotions, but you are pure Spirit. So now,
please raise your hand and place it on your

01:55:54.400 --> 01:56:01.400
heart, and here again you say with full confidence,
“Mother, I am the Spirit”, “Mother,

01:56:07.490 --> 01:56:14.490
I am the pure Spirit”, please say it.
The Divine power is the ocean of knowledge

01:56:30.150 --> 01:56:37.150
and of love, it is the ocean of compassion
and blessings, but above all, it is the ocean

01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:50.030
of forgiveness. So, whatever mistakes you
might have committed, this ocean is so powerful

01:56:55.090 --> 01:57:02.090
that it dissolves all such mistakes into nothing.
So, please, believe that you are not guilty

01:57:08.490 --> 01:57:15.490
at all of anything, please! Now, raise your
hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:27.580
and turn your head to [SOUNDS LIKE: a OR the??]
right, and here you have to say with full

01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:36.990
confidence, please say it with full confidence,
sixteen times, “Mother, I am not guilty

01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:47.350
at all.” Please say it sixteen times, this
is the center you are catching very badly,

01:57:47.350 --> 01:57:54.350
please say it sixteen times with full confidence,
I assure you that you are not guilty of any

01:57:56.850 --> 01:58:03.850
mistakes, please, believe Me! Now, sixteen
times you have to say. Now, you have to forgive

01:58:32.670 --> 01:58:39.640
everyone, as I explained you beforehand that
whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:46.640
you don't do anything, but you play into wrong
hands. So please, please, forgive everyone,

01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:56.900
just forgive everyone without thinking about
them, without counting them, just forgive

01:58:57.400 --> 01:59:04.400
everyone in general. Please do that, it will
help you and help Me a lot to open this center.

01:59:06.010 --> 01:59:13.010
Now raise your right hand on your forehead
across and put down your head and press on

01:59:15.550 --> 01:59:22.550
both the sides. At this center, you have to
say with full confidence, “Mother, I forgive

01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:38.550
everyone.” Now, not how many times, but
from your heart, believing in it, please say,

01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:51.940
“Mother, I forgive everyone.” Now, for
your own satisfaction, I have warned you not

02:00:07.190 --> 02:00:14.190
to feel guilty at all, you put your right
hand on the backside of your head and push

02:00:14.300 --> 02:00:21.300
back your head, as far as possible upward.
Here, you have to say, for your own satisfaction,

02:00:26.500 --> 02:00:33.500
not counting your mistakes or feeling guilty,
“Oh Devine Power, if I have done any mistakes,

02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:42.170
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me.”
This also you have to say from your heart,

02:00:42.170 --> 02:00:49.170
not how many times. “Oh Devine Power, if
I have done any mistakes, knowingly or unknowingly,

02:00:53.250 --> 02:01:00.250
please forgive me”.
Now, stretch your hand, your palm, in such

02:01:05.770 --> 02:01:12.770
a way that your fingers are pushed back. Put
the center of your palm exactly on the place

02:01:15.770 --> 02:01:22.770
known as the fontanel bone area where you
had a soft bone in your childhood. Now press

02:01:23.470 --> 02:01:29.380
it hard, push back your finger, very important
to push back your fingers. Now, put down your

02:01:29.380 --> 02:01:36.380
head as far as you can, and carefully you
have to move your scalp, but before that I

02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:47.320
have to tell you that I cannot force Self-Realization
on you. I respect your freedom, you have to

02:01:47.360 --> 02:01:54.360
ask for it, so you move your right hand with
big pressure on your scalp, seven times, slowly,

02:01:56.990 --> 02:02:02.420
clockwise, saying, “Mother, please give
me my Self-Realization.”

02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:09.420
[MOTHER GIVES THE SELF-REALIZATION]
Now, please, take down your hands and slowly

02:02:57.760 --> 02:03:04.760
open your eyes. Now, put your right hand towards
Me like this, little higher, and put down

02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:18.340
your head and see for yourself, you have to
be certify if there is a cool or hot breeze

02:03:18.590 --> 02:03:23.590
coming out of your head. Some people will
get hot because the heat has to come out,

02:03:23.590 --> 02:03:29.510
put down your head and see for yourself. Don’t
touch your head, little away, some people

02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:36.510
get it very much further down, but still,
you can see it here. Now, don't touch, don't

02:03:45.190 --> 02:03:50.920
touch your head, don't touch, take it further,
it’s not to touch, alright. Now, put your

02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:57.920
left hand towards Me, please put your left
hand like this, like this, like this, left

02:03:57.990 --> 02:04:04.670
hand, now put down your head and see for yourself,
but not touching it, further away. There should

02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:10.630
be a distance between your head and you hand,
please see now. Is there a cool breeze or

02:04:10.630 --> 02:04:17.630
a hot breeze coming out of your head? Now,
again the right hand, and put down your head

02:04:27.950 --> 02:04:34.950
again and see with the left hand. Now, put
your both the hands, put up your, both the

02:04:46.130 --> 02:04:51.930
hands like this, push back your head and ask
a question, “Mother, is this the cool breeze

02:04:51.930 --> 02:04:58.930
of the Holy Ghost?” “Mother, is this the
All-Pervading Power of God?”, or “Mother,

02:04:59.150 --> 02:05:06.030
is this the Paramchaitanya?” Ask anyone
of these questions three times, put back your

02:05:06.030 --> 02:05:13.030
head and ask.
Now, put down your hands, please. Now you

02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:30.400
watch Me without thinking, you can do it,
without thinking. Now, those who have felt

02:05:32.090 --> 02:05:39.090
the cool or the hot breeze out of their heads
or on their hands or fingertips, please raise

02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:46.680
both your hands, both your hands, both.
Just imagine, the whole of San Diego, may

02:05:48.900 --> 02:05:55.900
God bless you all! You felt it? So, this is
the city of Devas, the city of Gods, and now

02:05:59.540 --> 02:06:06.540
you are the Saints, but you must look after
your ascent and your fixing up the ascent,

02:06:07.970 --> 02:06:12.450
that's all you have to do. Little steadily,
those who haven’t got Realization also,

02:06:12.450 --> 02:06:17.190
[SOUNDS LIKE: with all of them get OR all
of them will get??], you can go and see the

02:06:17.190 --> 02:06:22.460
people who are here, they have been working
here for so many days, but what they say that,

02:06:22.460 --> 02:06:27.100
“People come here and then go somewhere
else, and then go somewhere else”, this

02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:32.570
is not the way it is going to work out. You
must pay full attention and you must work

02:06:32.570 --> 02:06:39.570
it out throughout and master it, absolutely
master it. You can do it, I know, you can

02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:46.940
do it, it’s very easy.
So, may God bless you all, and next year I’ll

02:06:46.940 --> 02:06:53.940
be again back here and see you all, may God
bless you! Now, use your hands, use your hands

02:06:54.340 --> 02:06:59.690
and see that how you can help people, how
you can help yourself. They’ll teach you

02:06:59.690 --> 02:07:05.190
everything, how to raise your Kundalini, the
whole technique. I told you that in the Veda

02:07:05.190 --> 02:07:10.420
there is written that you must Mantra, Yantra
and Tantra, three things after Realization,

02:07:10.420 --> 02:07:17.420
that is the “Mantra” is the chanting,
what is to be used for Raising the Kundalini,

02:07:17.590 --> 02:07:24.590
and “Tantra” is the one which is the technique,
and “Yantra” is the mechanism. Everything

02:07:25.090 --> 02:07:31.300
you will know, in no time, only thing you
should assiduously work it out and respect

02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:37.180
your Self-Realization, respect your Self-Realization.
You are very important, I think, San Diego

02:07:37.180 --> 02:07:43.360
people are the most important people for the
whole of America. Please, I hope, you’ll

02:07:43.360 --> 02:07:50.360
not let me down.
May God bless you!
