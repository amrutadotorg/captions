WEBVTT

00:00:03.701 --> 00:00:10.234
Yesterday was such a nice time we had together, and we really enjoyed Diwali, I think.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:21.601
I’ve never seen such a joyous ocean, absolutely going in a tempest.

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:29.234
We have achieved the purpose of Diwali Puja, I think, only yesterday:

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.567
it’s to feel the joy of God’s love.

00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:49.167
But “diwali” word is from “deepa wali” means the “rows of lights”.

00:00:49.234 --> 00:01:00.701
It was celebrated firstly because thousands of years back,

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:08.267
Shri Rama was crowned on this day.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:19.334
That means the benevolence of human beings was crowned, was accepted.

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:33.400
And in Shri Rama’s life, you see an ideal personality being shown to be a king,

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:43.234
to be the benevolent king as described by Socrates.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:51.601
So this was a great joyous thing that a benevolent king was crowned.

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:59.067
That means we have to have a king who is benevolent.

00:02:00.634 --> 00:02:17.167
That’s only possible if the people who choose the king

00:02:17.234 --> 00:02:29.601
have no other consideration but that of benevolence of all the people.

00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:39.567
So one has to come to the conclusion that they have to be Sahaja Yogis,

00:02:39.634 --> 00:02:47.434
because other think that: “How much money we’ll get out of this power that we’ll have."

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:52.400
Some think: “How much power-oriented we could be?”

00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:59.701
Some think: “How many countries I can win?”

00:02:59.767 --> 00:03:03.033
or any other domination.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.434
So we’ve got two types of theories: as we see, is one is communism and another is democracy,

00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:13.767
where one is power-oriented, the another is money-oriented,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.167
and in both the cases we say that it’s all failed.

00:03:19.234 --> 00:03:23.200
And it’s a good news for all of you to know that Russia,

00:03:23.267 --> 00:03:31.634
which was a country known to be run in complete fear,

00:03:31.701 --> 00:03:36.167
has turned out to be the best for Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:36.234 --> 00:03:40.334
It is one of the super powers.

00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:54.567
When the government is like that, I think the people are better.

00:03:54.634 --> 00:04:02.200
They do not have these false notions of individual freedom.

00:04:02.267 --> 00:04:06.000
They do not think that: “Ah, what’s wrong?”

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:10.334
I told them: “You must put oil on in your head because you’ll become bald."

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.033
Next day all of them were done with the oil, nothing doing.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:27.601
So the kind of obedience they had, from very beginning of their country,

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:34.033
that sense of obedience is so great, you tell them anything, immediately they do it.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.300
Not one, thousands.

00:04:38.367 --> 00:04:43.267
One thousand were sitting in the hall; two thousand were outside waiting for Me,

00:04:43.334 --> 00:04:46.534
on a follow-on.

00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:49.334
Imagine how wise and deep they are?

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.067
While in the West we are lost in our so-called freedom idea

00:04:53.133 --> 00:04:56.100
of so-called freedom: “What’s wrong?”

00:04:56.167 --> 00:05:00.133
But actually we are slaves, if you see.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.300
Any fashion that starts, everybody starts doing it.

00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:06.801
But why?

00:05:07.033 --> 00:05:11.100
Why do we follow those fashions? We must see how we are slaves.

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:14.400
Because others will laugh at us if we don’t do like that.

00:05:14.467 --> 00:05:16.701
They’ll make fun of us.

00:05:16.767 --> 00:05:18.701
Because they will criticize us.

00:05:18.767 --> 00:05:23.133
So because they have got a freedom to criticize,

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.534
we are frightened of such people who can criticize.

00:05:26.601 --> 00:05:31.167
And now the criticizing people are criticizing them.

00:05:31.234 --> 00:05:33.634
Critics have critics, their critics are there,

00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:37.100
there are other critics, and there are critics after critics.

00:05:37.167 --> 00:05:40.100
So only the critics are produced. Where is the benevolence?

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:42.701
There’s no question of benevolence at all.

00:05:42.767 --> 00:05:49.133
So in the freedom loving people who are supposed to be free,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:55.100
the idea of benevolence is finished.

00:05:55.167 --> 00:05:59.534
Because whatever good for you, whatever is benevolent for you,

00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:04.100
can be only understood if you have wisdom, if you have depth.

00:06:04.167 --> 00:06:08.467
But if you have this kind of freedom is to go amuck, do what you like:

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:13.133
“Because everybody’s doing it, I must do it.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.701
Everybody is singing like this; so I must do it."

00:06:17.767 --> 00:06:23.167
But from where does this idea come in?

00:06:23.234 --> 00:06:27.400
From where these ideas come in are the entrepreneurs

00:06:27.467 --> 00:06:31.734
who want to befool you, make slaves out of you,

00:06:31.801 --> 00:06:35.267
and this slavery is so-called freedom for you.

00:06:35.334 --> 00:06:40.801
But actually, I think it’s complete slavery because you do what they tell you,

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:45.434
behave in the same manner as whatever they say.

00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:51.200
There are no fashions in that country,

00:06:51.267 --> 00:06:55.367
very few, very few women indulge into fashions.

00:06:55.434 --> 00:06:56.434
Nothing.

00:06:56.501 --> 00:07:01.100
And men are also very simple. They have no fashionable things.

00:07:01.167 --> 00:07:04.734
They have only things which are convenient, good for their climate.

00:07:04.801 --> 00:07:09.267
That’s what they wear, whether you laugh or don’t laugh.

00:07:09.334 --> 00:07:11.734
It’s everybody laughs here.

00:07:11.801 --> 00:07:13.801
If anybody laughs at them they’ll say:

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:19.801
“This is stupid, you see, I’ll have pity for him, that’s all."

00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:27.734
So one has to understand that it was the king, Rama, who was made the,

00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:33.100
actually accepted by the public, like a crown was put on his head

00:07:33.167 --> 00:07:38.634
to say that benevolence is the highest thing.

00:07:38.701 --> 00:07:46.033
And whatever is benevolent for us should be accepted in our freedom,

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.267
if we are really a free country.

00:07:49.334 --> 00:07:56.467
But if we are not free inside, we are bound by what people will say; they’ll criticize us.

00:07:56.534 --> 00:08:01.133
Do you know as a result of that, there is no art in this country [Italy]?

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.334
But I saw lot of art growing in Russia.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:12.567
Because any art you produce is criticized, so people have to be careful:

00:08:12.634 --> 00:08:15.767
“This should not be so much, little this, little that."

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.300
Nobody can produce any art there.

00:08:19.367 --> 00:08:23.501
Any musician is there is criticized in these countries.

00:08:23.567 --> 00:08:27.767
There if you go, the musicians are tremendous musicians.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.501
They have of a very high quality musicians there, very high quality of dramatist,

00:08:36.567 --> 00:08:41.334
not at all boring as they are here.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:45.334
If you go any play in England, it’s so boring

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:49.801
that you feel like running away from there, extremely boring.

00:08:50.033 --> 00:08:51.701
There was a play, we went to see,

00:08:51.767 --> 00:08:55.501
it was called as “Star Express” or “Express Star” or something.

00:08:55.567 --> 00:08:57.767
There was nothing, except on the wheels

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.300
they were moving round as ghar-ghar, ghar-ghar. Nothing there !

00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:05.300
So anybody would go mad with it, I tell you.

00:09:05.367 --> 00:09:08.701
We were there hardly for fifteen minutes, came out with a headache.

00:09:08.767 --> 00:09:11.434
We didn’t know where to go.

00:09:11.501 --> 00:09:15.167
So with this kind of criticism that we have, it’s only freedom we have

00:09:15.234 --> 00:09:19.267
is to criticize other, make fun of others, react to others.

00:09:19.334 --> 00:09:21.701
How can you enjoy?

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:32.601
To enjoy others first of all you must accept the goodness of other people,

00:09:32.667 --> 00:09:36.033
not mentally, from your heart.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:41.000
And that will bring the benevolence

00:09:41.067 --> 00:09:48.701
on this country of ours which we call the Kingdom of God.

00:09:48.767 --> 00:09:58.667
Then there is, the second day is where Narakasura was killed.

00:09:58.734 --> 00:10:07.100
Now Narakasura was the one who was the devil from the Hell, they say:

00:10:07.167 --> 00:10:16.167
very cunning, very clever, and he was killed by the Goddess.

00:10:16.234 --> 00:10:24.501
Actually he was killed by a, another Incarnation, Kartikeya,

00:10:24.567 --> 00:10:29.000
but Goddess gave Him the power to kill.

00:10:29.067 --> 00:10:35.133
So when he was killed it was celebrated because the evil was killed,

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:43.133
but we don’t find that, these days the evil people are getting peace awards.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.434
So what is the reason for this kind of a perverted brain?

00:10:48.501 --> 00:10:53.133
How is it they are using perversion?

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.033
Just the opposite of it.

00:10:58.067 --> 00:11:05.300
What has worked out these things, so again we find the same so-called freedom

00:11:05.367 --> 00:11:10.367
to become also evil.

00:11:10.434 --> 00:11:13.601
So we have freedom to become evil.

00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:17.467
First of all, we have freedom not to be benevolent,

00:11:17.534 --> 00:11:21.767
and secondly to become evil we have freedom.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.501
So the Narakasura within us must be killed,

00:11:24.567 --> 00:11:30.367
the one which teaches us evil, to do evil to others.

00:11:30.434 --> 00:11:35.634
If you are busy doing evil to others, you can never enjoy.

00:11:35.701 --> 00:11:40.634
Because you enjoy doing evil to others.

00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:47.434
So that has to be faced within ourselves, not in other people.

00:11:47.501 --> 00:11:54.567
It’s very easy to say that this Sahaja Yogi is caught up, that Sahaja Yogi is like that,

00:11:54.634 --> 00:11:57.167
but very difficult to say: “Mother, I am caught up.

00:11:57.234 --> 00:12:02.100
I have got this problem within myself."

00:12:02.167 --> 00:12:06.334
So when you start seeing yourself your heart opens out.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:12.367
Unless and until you learn how to open out your heart how can you enjoy?

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:15.400
Open your heart.

00:12:15.467 --> 00:12:18.767
Many people live on very superficial level.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.667
All right, some of them might say that:

00:12:20.734 --> 00:12:25.634
“I am possessed, Mother. I’ve got this possession." Why?

00:12:25.701 --> 00:12:29.167
“I’ve got this conditioning, that conditioning." But why?

00:12:29.234 --> 00:12:32.067
You don’t want to enjoy.

00:12:34.234 --> 00:12:36.767
So watch yourself, see for yourself.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.601
This is my conditioning, “All right, I’ll put you right."

00:12:39.667 --> 00:12:41.367
See in the mirror. Tell yourself:

00:12:41.434 --> 00:12:45.534
“This kind of a useless conditioning I’ve got it from where?

00:12:45.601 --> 00:12:50.000
Because I’m Indian, because I’m French, because of English."

00:12:50.067 --> 00:12:53.300
Open the heart.

00:12:53.367 --> 00:12:58.567
And opening the heart is only possible if Narakasura sitting on your heart

00:12:58.634 --> 00:13:02.000
is killed, finished, once for all.

00:13:06.267 --> 00:13:10.033
In small, small things there is joy.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.634
In very little things also there’s a ripple of joy.

00:13:14.701 --> 00:13:17.567
If you are sensitive you can catch it.

00:13:17.634 --> 00:13:20.601
And why not enjoy?

00:13:20.667 --> 00:13:27.734
Why to have these stupid conditioning on our heads for nothing at all that we can’t enjoy?

00:13:27.801 --> 00:13:34.667
Enjoyment is only possible if you take out this one sitting on your heart.

00:13:34.734 --> 00:13:43.767
So, that is the second part of the Diwali that you have to open your heart.

00:13:46.434 --> 00:13:50.434
Forget your nationality, forget your race, forget everything.

00:13:50.501 --> 00:13:53.033
It’s a funny kind of things Sahaja Yogis have.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:59.367
They must be respected, they must be treated like this, or maybe that

00:13:59.434 --> 00:14:02.467
we are something great and they are no good.

00:14:02.534 --> 00:14:08.334
If you cannot mix up with the collective, something’s wrong with you.

00:14:08.801 --> 00:14:12.200
Nothing wrong with others.

00:14:12.267 --> 00:14:15.200
Easy to find faults with others.

00:14:15.267 --> 00:14:16.400
But what’s the use?

00:14:16.467 --> 00:14:21.300
If you start finding faults with others you do not become clean.

00:14:21.367 --> 00:14:24.434
Supposing I find that your clothes are not clean.

00:14:24.501 --> 00:14:29.801
My clothes are not going to get clean by that, are they?

00:14:30.033 --> 00:14:35.400
It’s so practical and simple it is that we should see ourselves, what’s wrong with us,

00:14:35.467 --> 00:14:43.334
and improve ourselves, so that we can really, really, from our heart, enjoy.

00:14:45.634 --> 00:14:48.434
Third one is a very beautiful thing is the Lakshmi Puja,

00:14:48.501 --> 00:14:50.467
means the day they worship Lakshmi.

00:14:50.534 --> 00:14:54.801
I’ve told you many a times, the symbol of Lakshmi was created really beautifully.

00:14:55.033 --> 00:15:01.267
And it was so that She came out of the water.

00:15:05.367 --> 00:15:10.467
Through the water, She came out so clean.

00:15:11.334 --> 00:15:21.167
And She has no pride.

00:15:21.234 --> 00:15:23.033
She doesn’t assert Herself.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:27.434
She doesn’t put Her pressure on others.

00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:31.501
But human beings are just opposite if they have money,

00:15:31.567 --> 00:15:35.033
they ride on a horse all the time, they cannot come down.

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:39.067
It’s impossible to talk to them.

00:15:39.133 --> 00:15:46.367
So a person who has money is not the one who is worshipping Lakshmi,

00:15:46.434 --> 00:15:50.367
who is not a “Lakshmi pati” as called him, the owner of the Lakshmi.

00:15:50.434 --> 00:15:52.367
Because She stands only on a lotus.

00:15:52.434 --> 00:15:56.133
Can you imagine how light She must be to stand on a lotus?

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:00.334
She has a big body, everything is there, but She stands on a lotus.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:05.601
That She takes all Her weight within Herself, She just sucks in Her weight

00:16:05.667 --> 00:16:08.100
as Shri Krishna has described.

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:14.033
That like a tortoise sucks in his legs inside his body, in the same way,

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.467
we have to suck in all the weight of money,

00:16:18.534 --> 00:16:25.801
weight of your positions, weight of your so-called education,

00:16:26.534 --> 00:16:32.534
weight of some aristocratic family you are born of.

00:16:32.601 --> 00:16:41.300
This is all nonsense which makes you a heavy person, to go down very fast.

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:50.267
So She stands, or floats in a way, on the lotus.

00:16:50.334 --> 00:16:54.334
And what a thing is beautiful, this lotus,

00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:00.501
that She doesn’t disturb any petals of the lotus, nothing.

00:17:00.567 --> 00:17:05.033
She just stands peacefully in a balance.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:09.267
Unless and until you have balance you cannot stand on a lotus.

00:17:09.334 --> 00:17:11.334
So She is so balanced.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:19.000
Her center of gravity is so balanced that She cannot topple down.

00:17:19.067 --> 00:17:24.267
Now in Sahaja Yoga, some people, you ask them: “How are you?”

00:17:25.367 --> 00:17:31.701
Ten years have passed, sometimes like this also.

00:17:34.434 --> 00:17:35.734
Why?

00:17:35.801 --> 00:17:45.167
Because you must be grounded in the Mother Earth, into the practical side of it.

00:17:45.234 --> 00:17:49.634
It’s nothing- something, we are hanging in the air,

00:17:49.701 --> 00:17:54.067
but we are grounded in the Mother Earth.

00:17:54.133 --> 00:18:02.200
And the slightest thing happens to us, again we come back to our balance.

00:18:02.267 --> 00:18:06.601
So this is Her position when She stands up in a lotus.

00:18:06.667 --> 00:18:12.367
Now She has a hand, one hand like this [which gives], one hand like this [which protects],

00:18:12.434 --> 00:18:16.167
and there are two hands which have got again the lotuses, the pink ones.

00:18:16.234 --> 00:18:22.434
Yesterday, you saw the pink, pink is Her fragrance I think is spread on the sky.

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:31.367
And She is pink, pink because that shows that Her house,

00:18:31.434 --> 00:18:38.267
Her nature is pink, pink is inviting, is loving.

00:18:38.334 --> 00:18:43.634
She is a very fond hostess,

00:18:43.701 --> 00:18:49.734
that She wants everybody to come in, in Her house.

00:18:49.801 --> 00:18:53.701
But if you see a rich man, he’ll have ten dogs outside

00:18:53.767 --> 00:18:56.467
and nobody can come inside the house.

00:18:56.534 --> 00:18:59.767
Only the dogs and he lives.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.701
He can’t live with human beings.

00:19:04.567 --> 00:19:08.000
So the house is closed, the doors are closed, everything’s closed,

00:19:08.067 --> 00:19:13.367
money is closed permanently.

00:19:14.033 --> 00:19:20.367
So, such a person cannot be called as Lakshmi pati, he’s not a Lakshmi pati.

00:19:20.434 --> 00:19:28.200
Because he must have a cozy, beautiful – cozy, again I say, cozy house.

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:33.501
“Cozy” doesn’t mean like a hospital, anything drops,

00:19:33.567 --> 00:19:35.734
you feel frightened: “Oh, my God."

00:19:35.801 --> 00:19:37.801
Then you’ll pick it up.

00:19:38.033 --> 00:19:43.133
“Cozy” means where you are comfortable. It’s all right.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.033
In the house, in the home, if somebody comes and stays.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.067
Then it’s little bit this here and there, doesn’t matter, then you put it right,

00:19:51.133 --> 00:19:54.667
but that doesn’t mean the lousy house also.

00:19:54.734 --> 00:20:00.033
It should not be taken as a lousy house, but a house which is inviting.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:06.534
When people come in, you give them a place to sit down and make them enjoy.

00:20:06.601 --> 00:20:08.567
It’s not done, in India at least.

00:20:08.634 --> 00:20:11.667
I don’t know, so far we are now quite getting westernized,

00:20:11.734 --> 00:20:14.167
that anybody drops something on the carpet

00:20:14.234 --> 00:20:19.000
we’ll never clean it in their presence because it’s very bad manners.

00:20:20.033 --> 00:20:24.667
Carpet is not important than the guest, is it?

00:20:24.734 --> 00:20:27.734
Or if we break something, say, a glass,

00:20:27.801 --> 00:20:33.000
then we say: “Very good, it’s something has gone out, some bad thing has gone out."

00:20:33.067 --> 00:20:38.234
Or a thermometer is broken we say the same thing.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:45.734
All these things happen,

00:20:45.801 --> 00:20:51.767
in a way, just to see how far we are open-hearted

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.033
or to suggest to you that something is going wrong.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:02.701
If something falls off just see what’s going on in your brain.

00:21:02.767 --> 00:21:05.067
What are you thinking?

00:21:05.133 --> 00:21:08.801
Is there something funny you are thinking about somebody

00:21:09.033 --> 00:21:13.434
or something wrong you are thinking? Then it’s up to you.

00:21:13.501 --> 00:21:17.801
Otherwise everything it’s nice and smooth.

00:21:18.033 --> 00:21:22.801
So, another conditioning we have, which is a very, very funny conditioning,

00:21:23.033 --> 00:21:26.534
either we’ll have the lousiest of lousiest houses

00:21:26.601 --> 00:21:31.033
or we’ll have houses which will just look like hospitals,

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:35.367
even a rat would not enter there, leave alone human beings.

00:21:35.434 --> 00:21:40.434
They’ll polish all the brass, they’ll polish everything.

00:21:40.501 --> 00:21:43.033
Husband, wife will fight on that.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:46.267
They’ll have divorces for it.

00:21:46.334 --> 00:21:49.067
But not even a rat will enter that house.

00:21:49.133 --> 00:21:51.501
I have seen many houses like that.

00:21:51.567 --> 00:21:56.100
And I’ve seen the other way round also: those that are lousiest, where there’s no garden,

00:21:56.167 --> 00:22:00.667
there are no flowers, nothing beautiful.

00:22:01.567 --> 00:22:06.434
So, we have to be not to this extreme or that extreme,

00:22:06.501 --> 00:22:13.601
but something that will give joy to others, to visitors,

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:18.133
to people who come to your house, we’ll soothe the sick.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.067
People should feel happy to come to your house.

00:22:22.133 --> 00:22:25.601
So there’s no showing off.

00:22:27.634 --> 00:22:34.767
Not to show off but to make them comfortable and very happy.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.667
You can do lots of things, very interesting things, if you have the Lakshmi principle in you.

00:22:41.734 --> 00:22:44.567
I’ve met once a Chinese gentleman.

00:22:44.634 --> 00:22:49.534
He had a very beautiful house, everything, and he was so interesting.

00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:53.501
He had made the house very interestingly, very nice, very beautiful.

00:22:53.567 --> 00:22:59.267
And you didn’t feel any aggression at all in that house.

00:22:59.334 --> 00:23:10.200
So, I saw his dining room done with very good, beautiful, green marble and white lights.

00:23:10.267 --> 00:23:12.334
I said: “Must be quite expensive."

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.467
“No, that’s the beauty. It’s very cheap. You know how I did it cheaply."

00:23:16.534 --> 00:23:20.033
All the time he was telling Me how he did things cheaply,

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.067
means he has never shown off it’s expensive.

00:23:23.133 --> 00:23:25.400
But a person who’s aggressive will say:

00:23:25.467 --> 00:23:30.033
“Oh, you know, this one I got it for so much, so much, so much."

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:34.234
But a person who wants to give you joy will say: “No, I tell you it’s so cheap,

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.701
you won’t believe what a sum."

00:23:36.767 --> 00:23:42.801
That’s the sign of a person who wants to give joy to his guests.

00:23:43.033 --> 00:23:47.701
He’ll never try to say that: “It’s very expensive, I spent so much money,

00:23:47.767 --> 00:23:49.467
this is so, this that."

00:23:49.534 --> 00:23:51.567
This is showing off.

00:23:51.634 --> 00:23:54.701
And then ultimately you’d say: “It’s very good,” three times.

00:23:54.767 --> 00:23:57.067
“Then it’s yours. Have it."

00:23:57.133 --> 00:24:03.367
Of course he can’t give you the floor, the rest of it you can take.

00:24:03.434 --> 00:24:09.367
That’s, that’s what it is a personality which is joy-giving.

00:24:09.434 --> 00:24:15.033
Like a lotus, as I have told you before also, a beetle comes,

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:18.501
a black beetle with horrible thorny legs,

00:24:18.567 --> 00:24:25.267
and enters into this lotus for a sleeping in the night, you see.

00:24:25.334 --> 00:24:33.033
And the lotus closes down its cosiness on it and sleeps very comfortably.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:38.133
And then next day it opens out, so it flies out.

00:24:39.667 --> 00:24:45.400
That’s how your homes, your ashrams, your hearts should be.

00:24:45.467 --> 00:24:54.334
Beautiful, so that anybody can feel that soothing and that comforting feeling,

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.667
when they are in your company.

00:24:56.734 --> 00:24:59.067
But not a person who was reactionary.

00:24:59.133 --> 00:25:03.267
Like you go to somebody’s house and immediately say: “I don’t like this carpet."

00:25:03.334 --> 00:25:08.033
See, it’s bad manners, absolute bad manners to say like that,

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:13.467
to say that: “I don’t like it,” it’s bad manners for Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:13.534 --> 00:25:18.601
Any music you hear, supposing there is a musician who could be of a very high level,

00:25:18.667 --> 00:25:24.601
could be of a very ordinary level, you should be able to enjoy everything;

00:25:24.667 --> 00:25:26.801
otherwise you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:25:27.033 --> 00:25:29.567
If you are going to criticize a musician

00:25:29.634 --> 00:25:33.634
that: “Oh, God, what a musician. He’s no good this, that”

00:25:33.701 --> 00:25:35.534
then he’s not going to improve.

00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:40.734
But if you encourage the musician: “Oh, you are very good, you are very great,”

00:25:40.801 --> 00:25:44.000
he’ll play much better next time; you’ll see that.

00:25:44.067 --> 00:25:47.634
There’s no falsehood about it.

00:25:47.701 --> 00:25:51.767
Some people think it’s not honest.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:01.100
But this kind of useless, absolutely fatal kind of honesty is not wanted in Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:01.167 --> 00:26:02.634
You be honest to yourself.

00:26:02.701 --> 00:26:09.067
And there’s no need to tell anybody your opinion very honestly.

00:26:09.133 --> 00:26:14.300
Keep it to yourself, all these honest opinions, and direct towards yourself.

00:26:14.367 --> 00:26:16.267
Like you see somebody.

00:26:16.334 --> 00:26:21.133
Now, honestly you want to tell him that he is wearing a funny dress, honestly.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:24.167
You better look at yourself.

00:26:27.067 --> 00:26:29.167
What sort of a dress you are wearing.

00:26:29.234 --> 00:26:32.367
And what business you have got to tell him that he’s wearing funny?

00:26:32.434 --> 00:26:35.234
On the contrary, you say: “This is very nice. I like it.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:38.167
It’s very nice. It’s good, good. Nice one."

00:26:38.234 --> 00:26:41.334
They’ll say: “No”. He’ll say that: “No, not so good. Yours is nice."

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.334
“Oh, you can get this very cheaply, you see, very cheaply.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:49.634
I’ll tell you from where. And you can have it if you like. I can take yours. You take mine."

00:26:49.701 --> 00:26:58.601
So the basic, subtle point is that, that with your love, you are encouraging everyone,

00:26:58.667 --> 00:27:08.767
you are helping everyone, you are creating a confidence in him, [in] his personality

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.801
and a kind of a rapport which is very subtle.

00:27:17.801 --> 00:27:25.334
So, a lotus is born in the pond, which is so dirty, filthy, full of worms, everything,

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.501
like as we see the world is today.

00:27:29.567 --> 00:27:36.267
But the lotus covers with his fragrance the whole of that pond and covers it up completely

00:27:36.334 --> 00:27:38.501
and you forget the thing what is behind.

00:27:38.567 --> 00:27:44.033
It has very big, big leaves, very big leaves, you see, like the ears of the elephant

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.100
and that covers the whole thing.

00:27:47.167 --> 00:27:52.501
So you don’t see any filth or dirt, what you see is beautiful, clean, big leaves.

00:27:52.567 --> 00:27:59.067
Sometimes they are like a “tali” [plate], like a big tali that we use for eating.

00:27:59.133 --> 00:28:05.367
And then all these things are covered with you.

00:28:06.167 --> 00:28:08.634
There’s no honesty about it.

00:28:08.701 --> 00:28:11.300
They could say: “Why should we be honest,

00:28:11.367 --> 00:28:15.767
let such say all the worms and the filth growing about?”

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:27.601
But the honesty lies in honestly understanding what is your job as Sahaja Yogi is.

00:28:27.667 --> 00:28:30.300
You are not there to point out the bad points

00:28:30.367 --> 00:28:33.667
but you are there to cover all the bad points,

00:28:33.734 --> 00:28:36.234
all the loopholes, with your love.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:42.601
That’s your job, and there you have to be honest.

00:28:42.667 --> 00:28:46.534
Sense of honesty, the way it is accepted these days,

00:28:46.601 --> 00:28:54.534
it has created only cheats and thugs and thieves.

00:28:54.601 --> 00:28:57.100
Even a thief can be won over.

00:28:59.067 --> 00:29:02.267
You can. I’ll give you an example.

00:29:02.334 --> 00:29:04.734
I met one boy in Delhi market.

00:29:04.801 --> 00:29:09.534
Poor thing, he was all wounded, he was suffering so I brought him in the car home.

00:29:09.601 --> 00:29:12.767
So in the family, My brother and My husband both got very worried.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.033
He said: “Who is this brother-in-law you have brought in?”

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.367
I said: “He is My nephew. All right, let it be.

00:29:18.434 --> 00:29:20.634
Doesn’t matter, whatever you say, I’ll keep him."

00:29:20.701 --> 00:29:24.601
So I looked after him. I treated him. He got all right.

00:29:24.667 --> 00:29:26.534
These two persons got after him:

00:29:26.601 --> 00:29:29.667
“We could send him to the police, send him to the police, this".

00:29:29.734 --> 00:29:33.367
I said: “Let’s try now, let us see, he’s a good man, he’ll be all right."

00:29:33.434 --> 00:29:35.534
“No, send him to the police."

00:29:35.601 --> 00:29:38.734
Might have been, I don’t know, might have been.

00:29:38.801 --> 00:29:43.634
And they were after his life; till ten days he was all right, I soothed him down.

00:29:43.701 --> 00:29:48.601
After tenth day, he was so fed up with these two persons, he ran away.

00:29:48.667 --> 00:29:52.501
And he ran away, and he ran away with what, do you know?

00:29:52.567 --> 00:29:58.534
He ran away with all the things that belonged to My brother and My husband.

00:29:58.601 --> 00:30:05.300
And he left My necklaces, My watches, everything nicely.

00:30:05.367 --> 00:30:10.534
He didn’t touch that; he didn’t touch that.

00:30:10.601 --> 00:30:13.300
Shri Mataji to someone: Hello, see when I am talking, don’t talk to each other.

00:30:13.367 --> 00:30:16.234
This is a new Sahaja Yogi? Tell him not to talk.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:21.167
When I’m talking don’t talk. That’s not the way.

00:30:21.234 --> 00:30:23.734
So he just ran away.

00:30:23.801 --> 00:30:28.133
And imagine, he left – I had a necklace, a very nice, beautiful, expensive necklace,

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.601
I should say, given by My mother – he didn’t touch it.

00:30:32.267 --> 00:30:35.434
He didn’t touch anything and he took away

00:30:35.501 --> 00:30:39.033
whatever was possible from their purse, from their things,

00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:43.734
whatever were left, everything he took away.

00:30:43.801 --> 00:30:48.133
“Now,” I said, “now go to the police."

00:30:51.267 --> 00:30:59.467
So, this is how one has to know that the honesty is for yourself, not for others.

00:30:59.534 --> 00:31:02.133
Don’t try to be honest with others.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.434
Be honest to yourself.

00:31:04.501 --> 00:31:08.400
Keep that honesty to yourself because maybe it’s rational

00:31:08.467 --> 00:31:14.033
and maybe that it is just a matter of habit that you are trying to hurt others.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:16.534
So first check on your mind and find out

00:31:16.601 --> 00:31:19.801
if you are trying to hurt others or you are trying to please others.

00:31:20.033 --> 00:31:22.767
Otherwise don’t talk; just keep quiet.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.400
If you are going to say something to please others, talk; otherwise just don’t talk.

00:31:28.467 --> 00:31:37.033
And you’ll be surprised, when you say nice things to others, how niceness comes to you.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:41.300
Like supposing somebody comes and tells Me that: “Mother, he is very bad.

00:31:41.367 --> 00:31:45.267
He has troubled me so much, this thing, that thing.

00:31:45.334 --> 00:31:49.033
I don’t like him,” so I tell him: “No, no, he was praising you a lot."

00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:51.701
It’s, it’s not honest, but I tell him:

00:31:51.767 --> 00:31:55.434
“He was praising you. He was so much in love with you. He’s so kind to you.

00:31:55.501 --> 00:31:57.734
He was telling Me he loves you very much."

00:31:57.801 --> 00:32:00.434
He said: “Really?” “Yeah, he did say."

00:32:00.501 --> 00:32:04.567
Next day you find them going together.

00:32:08.067 --> 00:32:12.434
So in Sahaja Yoga, once you come in there’s very little, is left out,

00:32:12.501 --> 00:32:14.033
very little here and there.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.000
And some of them are really very superficial

00:32:17.067 --> 00:32:21.100
but most of you have very little things left here and there.

00:32:21.167 --> 00:32:25.000
And only if you can watch that part you can throw it away

00:32:25.067 --> 00:32:30.367
and you can really become very joyous people.

00:32:38.267 --> 00:32:42.667
Now there are some people who never smile, who never laugh.

00:32:42.734 --> 00:32:46.434
So then you are allowed to tickle them.

00:32:49.534 --> 00:32:51.634
It’s absurd.

00:32:51.701 --> 00:32:57.701
It’s said that you have to be like children; you have to be like children.

00:32:57.767 --> 00:33:01.501
You play with something, finished; then you play with another, finished.

00:33:01.567 --> 00:33:06.634
You don’t get involved into anything. You don’t get attached to anything.

00:33:06.701 --> 00:33:10.634
Unless and until you’ve that child-like heart you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:10.701 --> 00:33:12.033
It’s useless.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.567
You will be here for years together; you will be useless, absolutely.

00:33:16.634 --> 00:33:20.234
Specially if you are coming from false gurus, it’s very difficult.

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.267
Because what I have known of false gurus, they never laugh,

00:33:23.334 --> 00:33:25.033
never smile, they are very serious.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:29.000
Only take your money, keep on the backside.

00:33:31.767 --> 00:33:38.501
So it is important that we should be in a very joyous mood, alert,

00:33:38.567 --> 00:33:43.133
aware, enjoying every bit of it.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.200
That’s one of the Lakshmi’s principles is.

00:33:47.267 --> 00:33:50.467
Now another thing is that,

00:33:50.534 --> 00:33:55.000
the suggestion is of the left hand is like this, means She is giving.

00:33:55.067 --> 00:33:58.033
A person who has money must give.

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:04.767
Not to the Pope, I never mean that, but must give to somebody who needs it.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.133
But so secretly that this hand should not know, is so far away, this one.

00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:13.501
This [left] hand should give, just secretly.

00:34:13.567 --> 00:34:16.167
Sometimes it’s difficult to give money to anyone.

00:34:16.234 --> 00:34:21.300
I find it difficult, because I find it that people will not like it.

00:34:21.367 --> 00:34:23.801
So there is a way of giving.

00:34:24.033 --> 00:34:26.334
There are so sweet ways of giving.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:30.667
Just try to notice what that person likes.

00:34:30.734 --> 00:34:35.567
Sometimes even children understand.

00:34:35.634 --> 00:34:38.467
Like I know, of My granddaughter.

00:34:38.534 --> 00:34:44.267
She said: “This boy, Nani, doesn’t even have any good chappels.

00:34:44.334 --> 00:34:46.467
I feel so bad about it. But how to give him?

00:34:46.534 --> 00:34:49.167
He will not take money from me."

00:34:49.234 --> 00:34:50.501
So I said: “You do one thing.

00:34:50.567 --> 00:34:53.701
You go and do something to his chappel."

00:34:53.767 --> 00:34:57.767
So she went and little bit spoilt his chappels more, you see.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.767
When they were walking together it broke.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.701
So she said: “Ah, see now, the chappels are broken."

00:35:02.767 --> 00:35:05.434
She took him to a chappel shop and bought him a chappel.

00:35:05.501 --> 00:35:09.334
He said: “But I have no money." “No, just take it. Just take it. It’s all right.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:14.534
Just, I’ll be very happy if you take." That’s how!

00:35:14.601 --> 00:35:21.133
It’s so sweet to hear and to do it, how beautiful it must be!

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:26.767
We like to hear everything, we want to see in a film everything good,

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.801
in a television, but when it comes to us we are different.

00:35:34.033 --> 00:35:37.234
When we see a mother-in-law torturing her daughter-in-law,

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.701
we always say: “Oh, look at her, how cruel she is."

00:35:39.767 --> 00:35:43.734
But we don’t want to see we are the same.

00:35:43.801 --> 00:35:47.000
So cruelty is out of question in Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:47.067 --> 00:35:50.067
Out of question!

00:35:50.133 --> 00:35:55.434
Nobody has to be cruel to anyone, nobody has right to be cruel,

00:35:55.501 --> 00:35:59.200
whether they are leaders or non-leaders or anything they are,

00:35:59.267 --> 00:36:06.467
you have no business anyway to be cruel to anyone, hurting anyone.

00:36:06.534 --> 00:36:11.100
We are not daggers, we are lotuses.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:17.267
Ha, if you have to hit somebody, hit with a lotus.

00:36:17.334 --> 00:36:21.033
It’s such a delicate thing.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:25.067
But it can be only understood if you go deep into it, into Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:25.133 --> 00:36:28.133
otherwise it cannot be understood.

00:36:30.701 --> 00:36:36.334
Now, a saint is a saint. He cannot become cruel, he cannot.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.634
There’s no need. What is the need to be cruel?

00:36:44.467 --> 00:36:49.267
So then with one hand there should be “daana” [donation], means “giving”.

00:36:49.334 --> 00:36:52.000
Giving in a way that is secret.

00:36:52.067 --> 00:36:55.767
There’s no need to give Me anything. I’ve been telling you: “Don’t give Me anything."

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.334
I don’t want to take anything.

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:01.167
If you give Me anything, gold and silver, I’ll leave it here. I cannot take it.

00:37:01.234 --> 00:37:07.801
The reason is not that, I mean, I don’t appreciate that you are loving Me, this thing,

00:37:08.067 --> 00:37:11.467
but a flower is sufficient for Me.

00:37:12.667 --> 00:37:16.767
But a person who needs something you must give.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.467
I’m so self-contained, you know that very well,

00:37:20.534 --> 00:37:23.033
that I can live anywhere, I can live on the street,

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.801
I can live anywhere, I have no problem,

00:37:25.033 --> 00:37:27.734
I can do without food, no problem.

00:37:27.801 --> 00:37:31.200
All right, in adoration you want to give Me something,

00:37:31.267 --> 00:37:33.434
but I’ve been telling that: “Don’t give Me.

00:37:33.501 --> 00:37:38.334
If you give Me anything expensive, I’ll leave it here. I will not take it."

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:45.801
And we have now passed a law or regulation, everything, but I hope you’ll listen to Me.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.601
So what is needed is the thing that we should know what is the dearth of another person,

00:37:55.667 --> 00:37:56.801
what will he need?

00:37:57.033 --> 00:38:02.334
You need silver for Puja, all right, I’ll give you silver, all right.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:08.801
But in such a sweet manner that you don’t feel that Mother is giving us it.

00:38:10.501 --> 00:38:15.267
So there should be a feeling of giving

00:38:15.334 --> 00:38:21.734
at the right time, at the best opportune moment, to give something.

00:38:21.801 --> 00:38:26.033
That is also one thing, just like a cameraman knows when to click,

00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:30.734
in the same way you must know when to click when giving is concerned.

00:38:30.801 --> 00:38:38.067
When odd times if you give, it can be a very hurting thing.

00:38:40.567 --> 00:38:49.300
The person can feel very hurt, if you give at the odd time to someone something.

00:38:49.367 --> 00:38:53.267
You have so many stories of that kind, like Sudama’s is that thing,

00:38:53.334 --> 00:38:55.300
when he went to see Shri Krishna.

00:38:55.367 --> 00:38:58.000
And Shri Krishna took out his procession,

00:38:58.067 --> 00:39:02.734
in the procession there were just taking out his bad eye with some pearls.

00:39:02.801 --> 00:39:07.000
So, Sudama said: “Let one pearl fall in to my lap also."

00:39:07.067 --> 00:39:09.367
He was very poor.

00:39:10.067 --> 00:39:16.067
But when he went back, he saw his house was made of gold by Shri Krishna.

00:39:16.133 --> 00:39:19.133
It was such a surprise!

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:22.701
So that elevates the heart.

00:39:22.767 --> 00:39:25.701
So it should be elevating.

00:39:25.767 --> 00:39:31.367
It should not be sensational, but it should be elevating,

00:39:31.434 --> 00:39:37.200
and that helps the person because, whatever you give for spiritual growth,

00:39:37.267 --> 00:39:48.133
is the one that is the best thing that you can give to anyone, even in material things.

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:54.767
Even in material things, you give something in for spiritual growth.

00:39:56.434 --> 00:40:01.300
There are so many ways, if you want to think about it, of giving someone something

00:40:01.367 --> 00:40:08.200
that spiritually, he feels comforted, he feels happy and joyous.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.234
Then another hand [right] is like this.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:20.501
This hand is showing that you have to protect, you have to protect.

00:40:20.567 --> 00:40:24.701
I’ve seen Sahaja Yogis, well some of them who are very superficial

00:40:24.767 --> 00:40:27.501
join hands with non Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:27.567 --> 00:40:30.601
Immediately, you can make out the fraternity.

00:40:30.667 --> 00:40:33.634
If I see one woman going with another woman

00:40:33.701 --> 00:40:37.300
whom I know is a bhootish one, I know that another must be.

00:40:37.367 --> 00:40:41.000
That’s how the combination always works.

00:40:41.067 --> 00:40:49.067
There’s a fraternity of good Sahaja Yogis and a fraternity of bad Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:49.133 --> 00:40:55.067
So when you see this [right] hand is a protection to all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:55.133 --> 00:40:59.167
We all have to protect each other, nobody should touch you.

00:40:59.234 --> 00:41:02.667
Of course, I’m all the time worried about your protection.

00:41:02.734 --> 00:41:07.100
If anybody comes and criticizes a Sahaja Yogi, any one,

00:41:07.167 --> 00:41:12.200
he may be the Prime minister and things, I’ll stand by the Sahaja Yogis.

00:41:12.267 --> 00:41:16.167
I’ll go up to any court or anywhere and I‘ll stand by that Sahaja Yogi.

00:41:16.234 --> 00:41:19.367
Even, he may be wrong, still I’ll I‘ll stand by the Sahaja Yogi

00:41:19.434 --> 00:41:21.601
because his Spirit is there.

00:41:21.667 --> 00:41:25.133
So we have to protect.

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:29.100
We have to protect our children, we have to protect our wives,

00:41:29.167 --> 00:41:36.367
we have to protect our husbands, we have to protect anaraksha [?] as they call it.

00:41:36.434 --> 00:41:42.701
Protect all the artists, protect all the people who need protection in this world.

00:41:42.767 --> 00:41:46.567
So many people need protection from Sahaja Yogis.

00:41:46.634 --> 00:41:52.300
Now see, the classical art is dying out, there are having funny sort of modern art.

00:41:52.367 --> 00:41:56.167
I don’t mind if it is really modern in the sense that they are evolved people

00:41:56.234 --> 00:41:59.167
and they are producing something of a spiritual value.

00:41:59.234 --> 00:42:03.534
But one line like that and one line like that makes a drawing or a painting.

00:42:03.601 --> 00:42:05.701
Don’t support such nonsense.

00:42:05.767 --> 00:42:09.467
Then poetry, which is wrong, should not be supported.

00:42:09.534 --> 00:42:13.300
Or literature which is talking of filthy things, ugly things,

00:42:13.367 --> 00:42:16.601
dirty things should never be protected.

00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:22.400
But whatever is good, whatever is beautiful produced, created by any one,

00:42:22.467 --> 00:42:26.467
even by a child, must be protected.

00:42:28.467 --> 00:42:32.601
Like a politician who is a honest politician is a good politician who is benevolent,

00:42:32.667 --> 00:42:35.567
he may not be a Sahaja Yogi, but he should be protected.

00:42:35.634 --> 00:42:39.501
In your heart of hearts you should think: “Mother, please protect this man."

00:42:39.567 --> 00:42:42.501
You must have feelings for them.

00:42:42.567 --> 00:42:47.767
So what we have to protect here is the goodness, is the peace.

00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:55.667
That’s our duty, we have to protect. We should not say: “All right, why should we care?

00:42:55.734 --> 00:42:59.133
He is not a Sahaja Yogi." No, but he is a good man.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:03.501
Whether he is a Sahaja Yogi or not doesn’t matter, but he is a good man so we protect him

00:43:03.567 --> 00:43:11.234
because of his virtues. You must protect a person who is virtuous, it’s very important.

00:43:12.601 --> 00:43:16.300
For his virtuous sake, you must protect him.

00:43:16.367 --> 00:43:20.367
And you should not be only limited among yourselves, Sahaja Yogis,

00:43:20.434 --> 00:43:23.767
you are the protectors of the world!

00:43:25.667 --> 00:43:28.367
You are the kings of the world, think like that.

00:43:28.434 --> 00:43:33.033
You have to worry about everything, what’s happening here and what’s happening there.

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:36.767
You must know every thing.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.801
So, some people say: “Mother says: don’t see television."

00:43:40.033 --> 00:43:43.667
I do not say like that, absolutely.

00:43:43.734 --> 00:43:47.534
What I was saying, you must see what is happening in the world.

00:43:47.601 --> 00:43:51.100
But all the time glued to the television, your eyes will be spoiled,

00:43:51.167 --> 00:43:54.067
and see all dirty, filthy nonsense, there’s no need.

00:43:54.133 --> 00:43:58.000
Why should I tell you? You yourself will know.

00:43:58.067 --> 00:44:00.267
But you must see things.

00:44:00.334 --> 00:44:05.033
You must be informed, well informed, specially the ladies must be very well informed.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:08.501
It’s very important, because what I found, ladies in Sahaja Yoga, they come,

00:44:08.567 --> 00:44:11.501
they just jump in the sea, finish there, that’s not the way.

00:44:11.567 --> 00:44:17.767
You must learn how to swim, you must know how to make others also to swim, protect them,

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.601
You must know every thing that’s going on in this world where you are born.

00:44:21.667 --> 00:44:25.000
You’re not to be just excluded from there, you must know everything.

00:44:25.067 --> 00:44:29.701
You ask Me, I’m a woman, I know everything about every country, I know the problem.

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:33.234
That’s how I can solve.

00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:39.300
In Colombia I went there, you know what has happened now in Colombia.

00:44:39.734 --> 00:44:43.567
In Russia, everywhere, you have to put your attention to all these things.

00:44:43.634 --> 00:44:47.267
Specially, the women must know they are shaktis

00:44:47.334 --> 00:44:51.200
and they’re shaktis of love, of attention.

00:44:51.267 --> 00:45:00.567
So this protective speciality has to be with us and we must know we are in charge.

00:45:00.634 --> 00:45:02.701
We are in charge of this world.

00:45:02.767 --> 00:45:06.601
We are in charge of the whole humanity; we have to look after them.

00:45:06.667 --> 00:45:09.400
We are not limited Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:09.467 --> 00:45:13.167
We are unlimited. We are eternal beings.

00:45:13.234 --> 00:45:18.467
And take up that personality within yourself, then only the Diwali is completed.

00:45:18.534 --> 00:45:21.701
You can’t have Diwali with something that is short lived,

00:45:21.767 --> 00:45:27.167
you have to have something that’s burning for ever.

00:45:27.234 --> 00:45:34.801
So this is the beauty of Sahaja Yoga is that you become really a great personality.

00:45:35.033 --> 00:45:39.000
But, it’s not the end of it.

00:45:39.067 --> 00:45:42.434
This is only the Lakshmi principle I told you.

00:45:42.501 --> 00:45:47.801
But once this Lakshmi principle covers you up, then the Mahlakshmi principle starts,

00:45:48.033 --> 00:45:54.501
is that you think of the world as a great challenge to you,

00:45:54.567 --> 00:46:01.067
that you have to give them Mahlakshmi principle, that you have to give them Realization.

00:46:01.133 --> 00:46:03.033
You have to raise them up.

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.400
And this principle, once starts working in the Mahalaksmi principle,

00:46:06.467 --> 00:46:12.400
then all the problems are your own.

00:46:12.467 --> 00:46:16.000
You have to start working it out.

00:46:16.634 --> 00:46:24.734
Change he attitude, is the best way I can say towards all other things

00:46:24.801 --> 00:46:28.767
that we have to solve the problem, we are here to solve the problem.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.367
Like, I’ve seen, it’s a very commun thing,

00:46:31.434 --> 00:46:34.234
somebody comes out with problem, I tell them: “Do this."

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:36.300
They’ll say: “But, in this this."

00:46:36.367 --> 00:46:38.501
“Then do that." “But in this, that."

00:46:38.567 --> 00:46:41.501
Like that they go on all the loops, false loops,

00:46:41.567 --> 00:46:44.033
until I’ll say: “Now this is your problem, not Mine.

00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:49.300
I’m giving you hundred solutions and none of them suits you."

00:46:49.367 --> 00:46:54.367
But here you should know you are the one who has to solve the problem. It is your problem.

00:46:54.434 --> 00:46:57.567
The world is your problem. Why were you born at this time?

00:46:57.634 --> 00:47:01.567
Why did you get your Realization and why are you Sahaja yogis?

00:47:01.634 --> 00:47:04.167
Just for name’s sake?

00:47:04.801 --> 00:47:11.100
So in every field you have to take a responsibility to see what you can do.

00:47:11.167 --> 00:47:15.234
Supposing you are an architect, all right, have designs made!

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:20.234
Create designs, just try. I’ll help you.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:26.334
You are a musician? Then take up ways and methods of spreading good music.

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:30.133
If you are writer then write something interesting, not boring,

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:34.367
something interesting, something which will elevate people.

00:47:34.434 --> 00:47:37.467
If you are a government servant, all right, try to show

00:47:37.534 --> 00:47:43.234
that you are acting for the government that is of a much higher level.

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:47.367
And such a person will be respected, very much respected.

00:47:47.434 --> 00:47:51.200
Everybody’s personality will grow, not that you run away from somewhere

00:47:51.267 --> 00:47:56.167
because most of the people say that: “Mother, we get caught up, this, that, you know."

00:47:56.234 --> 00:47:58.767
It depends on.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Now I told you that I have to sometimes shake hands

00:48:02.067 --> 00:48:06.200
with six hundred people who are sometimes absolutely drunk.

00:48:06.267 --> 00:48:10.234
So it’s all right; that’s My job.

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.367
So we are not going to run away.

00:48:13.434 --> 00:48:18.501
We are covered with the protection of the spirituality.

00:48:18.567 --> 00:48:25.667
If you can keep to the central path of Sushumna nobody can touch you.

00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:35.067
So out of the Lakshmi principle I hope you get all the tatwas,

00:48:35.133 --> 00:48:39.234
all the principles, satisfied in you, fully,

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:44.000
and also the Mahalakshmi principle flows through your being.

00:48:44.067 --> 00:48:48.734
You have to be very satisfied and comfortable people.

00:48:48.801 --> 00:48:50.467
Not to find faults.

00:48:50.534 --> 00:48:58.067
If you are finding faults, then know that you are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:48:58.133 --> 00:49:02.300
If you are trying to control others, then know that you are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:07.534
Even the leaders, I would say, should never try to control.

00:49:07.601 --> 00:49:10.667
They must know how the principle is working in the silence;

00:49:10.734 --> 00:49:13.801
see for themselves how it is working.

00:49:15.334 --> 00:49:18.601
It’s a trick you must learn.

00:49:19.334 --> 00:49:22.634
Of course, little correction is needed, that time you correct the person.

00:49:22.701 --> 00:49:24.801
At that time, doesn’t matter.

00:49:25.033 --> 00:49:30.534
But you must know how the whole principle of benevolence is working itself.

00:49:30.601 --> 00:49:35.601
The whole Paramachaitanya is doing the benevolence part; you must know that.

00:49:37.667 --> 00:49:41.200
As I’ve told you before also, you have to be like the sea

00:49:41.267 --> 00:49:47.234
which receives all the rivers into it.

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:51.801
If you are on top of the hill you cannot receive anything.

00:49:52.033 --> 00:49:59.133
So you have to be like a sea to receive everything and you have to be at the height.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:05.267
As I told you the other day, the same way, that very close to the sea,

00:50:05.334 --> 00:50:08.701
there should be a personality which is above everything else.

00:50:08.767 --> 00:50:11.067
Such a beautiful personality you should have,

00:50:11.133 --> 00:50:15.734
is the depth of the sea and the height of the Kailasha.

00:50:15.801 --> 00:50:18.067
May God bless you all.
