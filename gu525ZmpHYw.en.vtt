00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:11.300
Today, we are going to worship the Mahalakshmi

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.333
which I think is very much worshipped in this country

00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:21.366
where they worship Her as Maria

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:27.533
and also there’s a swayambhu of Maria, you must have seen.

00:00:27.613 --> 00:00:34.200
And also there was an apparition of
Her. First I never believed that it could be,

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.567
but then after feeling the vibrations, now I know it was true,

00:00:40.647 --> 00:00:44.366
that She did appear here in an apparition.

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:50.113
She appeared before Me, also,
you must have seen, in a photograph.

00:00:55.146 --> 00:01:04.066
This is the principle by which you have risen to this state.

00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:10.567
The central path of your ascent
is created by Mahalakshmi power

00:01:10.647 --> 00:01:14.533
for the Kundalini to rise.

00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:18.266
In the temple of Mahalakshmi in Kolhapur

00:01:18.346 --> 00:01:22.233
they always sing the song of “Ude, Ude, Ambe.”

00:01:22.313 --> 00:01:31.033
So I asked the people there, “Why do you
sing Ambe’s song in Mahalakshmi’s temple?”

00:01:31.113 --> 00:01:38.166
So they said that, “We don’t
know why we do it, but is it wrong?”

00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:46.400
I said, “No, because only in the Mahalakshmi channel

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.300
Kundalini can rise and Kundalini is the Amba.”

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.600
That’s how, you see, they
understood and they were really amazed

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.667
that I explained it very well ‘cause from ancient times

00:02:00.747 --> 00:02:07.813
this song has been sung there and
they never knew why this song is sung.

00:02:09.747 --> 00:02:18.200
Coming to the point of Mahalakshmi,
we have to understand what does it do,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.333
what it’s help is that this Mahalakshmi
channel or the Mahalakshmi’s powers

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:38.667
have created within us a proper
balance, a proper route for Kundalini to rise.

00:02:38.747 --> 00:02:44.500
Left and right has been balanced
and She is the one who creates

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:54.066
and makes a wider path for Kundalini to rise.

00:02:54.146 --> 00:03:01.567
This is the path of compassion and love.

00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:06.266
Through that compassion and love She creates this path

00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:14.333
because She knows that if the path is
not wide enough the Kundalini cannot rise.

00:03:14.413 --> 00:03:21.033
Ultimately, one reaches a state where you start seeking

00:03:21.113 --> 00:03:26.533
and when you start seeking, your
Mahalakshmi principle has been awakened.

00:03:26.613 --> 00:03:31.400
That is awakened and sometimes it is very strong.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.999
Then you start seeking in a mad way.

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.166
I am sorry to say that many are already lost in seeking,

00:03:39.246 --> 00:03:48.400
but there are so many who have now
come to the right path and to the right ascent.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.300
The another thing this
Mahalakshmi principle does is to allow

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.066
the Kundalini’s power to go to different chakras also,

00:03:59.146 --> 00:04:04.133
to make a way to different
chakras and corrects all the chakras.

00:04:04.213 --> 00:04:08.066
She is a very flexible force, I should say,

00:04:08.146 --> 00:04:12.467
which guides the Kundalini into different chakras

00:04:12.547 --> 00:04:17.667
and She understands which chakra
needs the help of the Kundalini.

00:04:17.747 --> 00:04:22.600
So you must have seen that when
the Kundalini rises how She pulsates,

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:30.166
where She goes, where She
shows the need is of your awakening.

00:04:30.246 --> 00:04:37.433
All this works out because She is full of compassion

00:04:37.513 --> 00:04:44.266
and love that you should get your absolute truth.

00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:47.999
We have many problems as it is, you know,

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:51.300
in Sahaja Yoga because when people are ascending

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:59.467
they carry on with them some of
their past stones and they cannot climb.

00:04:59.547 --> 00:05:05.467
They try then they fall, they try then
they fall, then they go up again, they fall.

00:05:05.547 --> 00:05:13.747
But today I’m going to tell you about
what is the state one has to achieve.

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:19.733
As Shri Krishna has said it in the “Gita,”

00:05:19.813 --> 00:05:23.500
describes Stitha Pragya, the second chapter,

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.133
but it’s very difficult to understand Him,
He is not so clear cut as your Mother is.

00:05:28.213 --> 00:05:33.280
So people don’t understand what He is
saying. (Aside: “Can you close the...?”)

00:05:39.513 --> 00:05:45.500
And they ask the question, “How, how
do you reach that state of Stitha Pragya?

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.633
How do you get to that stage?”

00:05:49.713 --> 00:05:52.733
But Gyaneshwara, when he wrote his “Gyaneshwari,”

00:05:52.813 --> 00:06:00.313
he called it as the Sahaja Stithi, means the state of Sahaj.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.400
He didn’t call Stitha Pragya. He called it as Sahaja Stithi,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:14.133
meaning the state of Sahaj.

00:06:14.213 --> 00:06:20.133
So he describes the Sahaj in a
very beautiful manner and very subtle.

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:25.213
Of course, Gyaneshwara also,
very few people understand, I think.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:34.400
A person who reaches that state is like a mirror

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:41.366
and so many faces pass over that
mirror, so many look into that mirror,

00:06:41.446 --> 00:06:50.966
so many decorate in front of the
mirror, but mirror is the same as it is.

00:06:51.046 --> 00:06:56.667
So the person who is a Stitha
Pragya or the person who is Sahaja

00:06:56.747 --> 00:07:05.767
is not bothered about what is facing
him, who is facing whom, where he is.

00:07:05.847 --> 00:07:13.066
He stays within himself. He contains within himself.

00:07:13.146 --> 00:07:21.767
Like the sun. If the sun plays with his different rays,

00:07:21.847 --> 00:07:26.600
he is not lost. All the rays again return to him.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:37.066
In the same way, all the senses that we have, all the senses

00:07:37.146 --> 00:07:45.166
that are there do play around, but
for a person who is in a Sahaja state

00:07:45.246 --> 00:07:49.767
it doesn’t matter, it makes no difference.
He’s not involved. He just plays around.

00:07:49.847 --> 00:07:57.066
Again, all of them come back to him.
This is a state you all have to achieve.

00:07:57.146 --> 00:08:01.567
Then you are really Sahaja
Yogis. But I still find people lost,

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:07.500
getting money out of Sahaja Yoga,
some people lost getting out of leaderships,

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:13.366
some are lost in getting jealousies and envies and all that.

00:08:13.446 --> 00:08:18.467
So that means a lot of work has to be done, still, within.

00:08:18.547 --> 00:08:24.166
There is no need to work as such if you leave everything.

00:08:24.246 --> 00:08:27.767
That’s why I always say meditate, because when you meditate,

00:08:27.847 --> 00:08:35.999
what happens, that all these things
that are pulling you down are finished.

00:08:36.079 --> 00:08:41.133
Gradually they disappear because you become your Self.

00:08:41.213 --> 00:08:45.333
You get contained by yourself and you are never bored.

00:08:45.413 --> 00:08:48.700
I am never bored. I don’t know
what boring word means, you see.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:54.400
When it is with you or alone, I never
get bored. What is there to get bored?

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.200
If you are not involved into anything you never get bored.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.567
Another thing is you rise
above all these things, like greed.

00:09:04.647 --> 00:09:08.767
Now people who are greedy are
still involved making money here,

00:09:08.847 --> 00:09:13.700
making money there, all that thing.
Those people who are still full of lust

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:19.433
are still making, organizing, some things like that.

00:09:19.513 --> 00:09:25.567
But in a Sahaj Stithi you just
watch. You are just a witness.

00:09:25.647 --> 00:09:32.133
You are not lost into anything that is pulling you down.

00:09:32.213 --> 00:09:36.500
This state is not difficult to achieve for you, at all,

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.533
because you have crossed over your mind.

00:09:39.613 --> 00:09:43.600
Now all these things come to you through your mind.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.266
I’ve already said that mind is
a myth, which you must accept.

00:09:49.346 --> 00:09:53.433
Myth is that this mind gives you ideas.

00:09:53.513 --> 00:09:57.166
Some people think, “Yes Mother, but - yes Mother, but - .”

00:09:57.246 --> 00:10:02.600
This “but” is coming from your brain, from your mind.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:08.433
The brain is reality, but not the mind. The mind says “but”

00:10:08.513 --> 00:10:13.033
and then you start feeling very
depressed sometimes, unhappy,

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:17.099
because some people feel even bad
because they are very good people,

00:10:17.179 --> 00:10:21.647
that there are so few Sahaja Yogis. Doesn’t matter.

00:10:22.647 --> 00:10:29.733
Just watch and this watching state,
this witness state is the Sahaja Stithi.

00:10:29.813 --> 00:10:34.300
In that you become so subtle, you become your Self,

00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:40.667
meaning so subtle that nothing can
disturb you, nothing can change you.

00:10:40.747 --> 00:10:47.600
Now see the nature as it is. You
know there are ninety-two elements

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.300
and ninety-two elements, none of them can be...

00:10:51.380 --> 00:11:00.733
say for example, you cannot
make silver into gold. Gold into silver.

00:11:00.813 --> 00:11:06.600
The atoms are so arranged that they have certain valencies

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:11.033
and apart from atom, even molecules are so arranged

00:11:11.113 --> 00:11:15.433
that they have their own structure. You cannot change.

00:11:15.513 --> 00:11:18.300
If you try to change then you will create bombs,

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:23.133
atomic bomb, this bomb. It’s absolutely destructive.

00:11:23.213 --> 00:11:27.333
It’s only human beings who can change, who can transform.

00:11:27.413 --> 00:11:33.567
Now look at the blessings that you are a
human being and you can be transformed

00:11:33.647 --> 00:11:40.200
and you can be made into a new element that is the Self.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.099
This is the specialty of human beings.

00:11:43.179 --> 00:11:46.066
But if somebody there is a false guru or somebody,

00:11:46.146 --> 00:11:49.266
he tries to do something, you’ll explode.

00:11:49.346 --> 00:11:54.033
I have seen people who have
been to false gurus, they still faint,

00:11:54.113 --> 00:11:58.099
they still have problems, they still get troubled

00:11:58.179 --> 00:12:03.300
more than people who have been without them.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.366
They are also all right now, much of them are improved;

00:12:06.446 --> 00:12:13.099
but this is one thing one should understand, that in one way

00:12:13.179 --> 00:12:17.433
when you are analyzing and when you are breaking an atom

00:12:17.513 --> 00:12:22.700
or you are breaking a molecule and trying to transform,

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:27.999
it explodes. It doesn’t work out.

00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:33.166
The other way round is that when you try to synthesize,

00:12:33.246 --> 00:12:36.366
then you can form anything in the nature.

00:12:36.446 --> 00:12:40.333
Like, this has now been brought out by synthesizing,

00:12:40.413 --> 00:12:44.633
this plastic is created by synthesizing.

00:12:44.713 --> 00:12:49.767
Matter can be synthesized and can be brought together

00:12:49.847 --> 00:12:55.767
and human beings have to get synthesized also.

00:12:55.847 --> 00:13:04.733
They can be synthesized better than
matter because they change, they transform.

00:13:04.813 --> 00:13:14.066
Now say example, there is gold. You
make gold into ornaments, make into anything.

00:13:14.146 --> 00:13:22.366
It remains all the time, all the
time gold. Gold is gold. It is there.

00:13:22.446 --> 00:13:26.966
It is not that by changing them into ornaments it changes.

00:13:27.046 --> 00:13:29.633
Its element is there. Gold is there.

00:13:29.713 --> 00:13:34.467
But for human beings they get
transformed when they are synthesized.

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:44.066
This is a very big difference between the
matter and the nature and human beings.

00:13:44.146 --> 00:13:50.433
Matter, nature are different absolutely from human beings.

00:13:50.513 --> 00:13:57.999
Human beings, once they are
transformed, it’s like a living process.

00:13:58.079 --> 00:14:05.066
They become like flowers but still
it is not that you see in the nature.

00:14:05.146 --> 00:14:11.500
It’s not the same as you see in the
nature because nature doesn’t have a mind.

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:18.467
It doesn’t have a mind. It just is under the control

00:14:18.547 --> 00:14:23.266
of the Divine or nature that it’s working out that way.

00:14:23.346 --> 00:14:28.480
But here you are under your own control.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.533
Here you can control yourself.

00:14:33.613 --> 00:14:39.200
In this synthesis which is growing inside you what you find,

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:43.600
that you are completely in control of yourself.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.767
You know what is happening to you.

00:14:46.847 --> 00:14:52.200
Now you start seeing yourself
separating from all these things.

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:58.033
Some people come and tell Me, “Mother,
see, my ego is very bad, you just take it out.”

00:14:58.113 --> 00:15:02.500
He sees his ego, he sees what is the problem is.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:06.999
Somebody says, “Mother, my Nabhi is
very bad,I’m still busy with the money.”

00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:13.700
He sees it. First starts the knowledge about yourself,

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:20.767
we call as self-knowledge. But one
has to even go beyond self-knowledge.

00:15:20.847 --> 00:15:25.213
By that knowledge, what do you do, we have to see.

00:15:27.547 --> 00:15:33.400
When you have the knowledge,
first we say there’s no knowledge,

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.767
people have no knowledge, they
are ignorant, there’s darkness, all that.

00:15:36.847 --> 00:15:43.433
Now the light has come, you can see.
You can know what’s wrong with you.

00:15:43.513 --> 00:15:50.133
Now you start separating yourself from all
those things that you see as wrong with you.

00:15:50.213 --> 00:15:55.600
You see them getting out. So
many nonsensical things there are.

00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.533
Like, we have jealousies, envy, greed and lust.

00:16:00.613 --> 00:16:04.999
I mean, it’s horrible things to
say on a Diwali function, see.

00:16:05.079 --> 00:16:11.999
So the Diwali is that one by one
so many lights are enlightened

00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:15.033
and you start seeing it first.

00:16:15.113 --> 00:16:19.033
First you start seeing what is wrong within you,

00:16:19.113 --> 00:16:22.667
and then as you see it, you don’t want it.

00:16:22.747 --> 00:16:30.366
Then you work out to get rid of it, to become clean.

00:16:30.446 --> 00:16:35.200
Now this also knowledge disappears.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:42.166
You don’t have to have any
knowledge. You are there. You are there.

00:16:42.246 --> 00:16:47.166
There is no need to know about
your chakras, you are just there.

00:16:47.246 --> 00:16:51.300
At that stage nothing matters.

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:55.999
You become just like a stone, I can say.

00:16:56.079 --> 00:17:02.633
Stone with a brain intact and
a heart intact and a liver intact.

00:17:02.713 --> 00:17:07.767
You just don’t mind anything, don’t get upset with anything.

00:17:07.847 --> 00:17:16.667
You just enjoy the love and compassion that’s flowing.

00:17:16.747 --> 00:17:21.600
And the ripples that come back to
you, even that is lost after some time

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.813
and you are just nothing but Sahaj.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:32.066
That is the state people achieved.
In those days they achieved this state.

00:17:32.146 --> 00:17:35.333
But with that, what lacking happened, that they’d get lost.

00:17:35.413 --> 00:17:39.266
They all got lost. They couldn’t do anything to others.

00:17:39.346 --> 00:17:45.033
One person getting it, becoming great,
finished. Or two persons at the most.

00:17:45.113 --> 00:17:48.999
So now Sahaja Yoga stands, first of all,

00:17:49.079 --> 00:17:53.333
at the knowledge state, where you have the knowledge.

00:17:53.413 --> 00:17:58.233
First, you should first of all have
full knowledge about yourself.

00:17:58.313 --> 00:18:01.700
The self-knowledge should be complete.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:06.300
Then in the third stage we should
say that when the knowledge is full

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:11.533
you should get rid of all those
things that you know about yourself,

00:18:11.613 --> 00:18:16.233
which are useless, which are hampering
your progress, which you know is wrong.

00:18:16.313 --> 00:18:22.033
Like, I see some dirt falling on
my sari, I’ll just clean it out like that.

00:18:22.113 --> 00:18:27.667
Then you start separating yourself into that Sahaja state.

00:18:27.747 --> 00:18:34.033
But still in Sahaja Yoga you develop another dimension

00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:41.099
which is collective consciousness.
That is the modern Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:41.179 --> 00:18:47.033
In the olden days they didn’t
have this, so they just all got lost.

00:18:47.113 --> 00:18:52.400
Now you have collective consciousness
and in that collective consciousness

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:57.966
you start feeling others, feeling
for others, compassion for others

00:18:58.046 --> 00:19:04.500
and you start working out for others.
In that also, sometimes, you know,

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.733
when you are working around, you
think, "How much money I can make?

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:10.775
What I can achieve as a leader?"

00:19:10.815 --> 00:19:14.567
or some sort of thing is still there.

00:19:14.647 --> 00:19:18.600
But this collective consciousness starts growing.

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:22.166
When it starts growing, then you become as I said,

00:19:22.246 --> 00:19:27.280
drop in the ocean, means complete ocean, you become.

00:19:28.413 --> 00:19:35.733
You become complete ocean. So the
ocean has its own mariadas. It doesn’t bother.

00:19:35.813 --> 00:19:39.467
It has to live with its mariadas,
it lives with its mariadas.

00:19:39.547 --> 00:19:42.433
It doesn’t want to cross any boundaries, all right.

00:19:42.513 --> 00:19:46.433
Accept it. It will not cross its boundaries.

00:19:46.513 --> 00:19:51.333
In the same way it happens that you are very self-contained.

00:19:51.413 --> 00:19:56.567
You are not selfish, but you become very self-contained.

00:19:56.647 --> 00:20:00.533
You are contained within yourself.

00:20:00.613 --> 00:20:05.366
I know many Sahaja Yogis are angry that
I have not punished many horrible people

00:20:05.446 --> 00:20:09.600
who have been troubling Sahaja Yoga. I don’t have to bother.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.767
There’s Paramchaitanya which is doing a lot of work.

00:20:12.847 --> 00:20:17.600
Let it look after it. Why should I bother about anyone?

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:22.780
You see, after all, things are
working out so why to interfere?

00:20:23.713 --> 00:20:32.600
My job is just to watch, just to see. That’s sufficient.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:39.300
There’s no need for Me to kill
anybody in this lifetime or to destroy.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:43.667
They are destroyed by themselves. I have told you that

00:20:43.747 --> 00:20:48.300
I need not expose people, but whichever country I go,

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:52.200
I find people get exposed. I run
away from there, really, sometimes,

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.099
thinking, "God knows what more is going to come."

00:20:56.179 --> 00:21:02.099
Even little attention on any country, it just works out.

00:21:02.179 --> 00:21:07.700
Even without My knowledge, “Oh
My God,” I said, “When did I do that?”

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:16.533
So one has to become, of course, he
becomes the power of Divine love, no doubt.

00:21:16.613 --> 00:21:22.266
He becomes the power of Divine
love, but he doesn’t handle it.

00:21:22.346 --> 00:21:25.400
Left to this Divine power which is working,

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:31.500
which is also separated from
Me, you’ll be surprised. I am alone.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:36.966
Absolutely alone. Even this power is separated from Me,

00:21:37.046 --> 00:21:41.066
but this power knows what is good for human beings,

00:21:41.146 --> 00:21:45.099
what is good for Sahaja Yoga. It works on its own.

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:50.066
I don’t interfere. It’s a reflex
action, believe Me, it’s a reflex action.

00:21:50.146 --> 00:21:54.600
Maybe you might say, “Mother, you
have made it.” All right, whatever it is,

00:21:54.680 --> 00:22:00.233
but I don’t interfere with it. I
don’t have to tell anything to it.

00:22:00.313 --> 00:22:03.433
It just works and it’s working so well.

00:22:03.513 --> 00:22:07.233
I’ll give you an example. Once in England long time back,

00:22:07.313 --> 00:22:09.333
they said, “Mother, we want to have a very long summer.”

00:22:09.413 --> 00:22:11.433
I said, “Why do you want to ask such things?”

00:22:11.513 --> 00:22:15.567
“No, no, Mother, we must have a long
summer, a very long summer, very - “

00:22:15.647 --> 00:22:23.333
Three or four times they said it and it
was a very long, horrible summer in London.

00:22:23.413 --> 00:22:27.266
And it’s not like India where
we have air conditioning, fans,

00:22:27.346 --> 00:22:31.667
something we have, at least
hand fans. There was nothing there.

00:22:31.747 --> 00:22:35.467
So we didn’t know. We had a
little gallery, we used to sleep in that.

00:22:35.547 --> 00:22:43.667
So we went to the shop in England
and we asked in London City, for a fan.

00:22:43.747 --> 00:22:47.733
So they said, “All right, after three months. You order us.”

00:22:47.813 --> 00:22:52.166
After three months when it will be
very cold they will give us the fan.

00:22:52.246 --> 00:22:57.500
We said, “We don’t want any fans.”
So My daughter sent two fans by plane.

00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.999
And that’s how we managed.
You see, Indians, we feel very hot

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:03.733
because we have had a lot of sun in our country,

00:23:03.813 --> 00:23:07.333
we feel much hotter than any one
of you. The way you sit in the sun,

00:23:07.413 --> 00:23:11.366
you know, we can’t understand.
You know, in India they used to say,

00:23:11.446 --> 00:23:16.166
"An Englishman and a mad dog can only go in the sun."

00:23:16.246 --> 00:23:19.600
So our situation is like that,

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.700
that we cannot go in the sun because we have had too much.

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:28.033
And this summer, you see, was so tremendous, so tremendous

00:23:28.113 --> 00:23:34.966
that after that one thing good happened.
That ochre color appeared on the leaves

00:23:35.046 --> 00:23:39.233
and then gradually the red and all that of the autumn season

00:23:39.313 --> 00:23:43.733
was best at that time and then one Sahaja Yogi dreamt that,

00:23:43.813 --> 00:23:47.633
“Mother asked me to drive in Her back yard.”

00:23:47.713 --> 00:23:54.266
So he told everybody that, “Mother has
been asking me to drive in the back yard.”

00:23:54.346 --> 00:23:57.999
So I telephoned to him, I didn’t
know he had dreamt like that,

00:23:58.079 --> 00:24:02.500
that, “Can you come along for a
while, I want to go and see this autumn

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:07.633
all over England.” So he came
and we were driving, miles together

00:24:07.713 --> 00:24:12.533
and then they told Me, “Mother, it was
so, he told us that that was My back yard.”

00:24:12.613 --> 00:24:17.066
Can you imagine that he was
driving for miles together, beautiful,

00:24:17.146 --> 00:24:23.166
just like Canada, the whole England
was filled with the beauty of autumn.

00:24:23.246 --> 00:24:28.500
So even if there’s something like
that happens, it is compensated.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:34.400
It is compensated and so beautiful it
was, all the people were out in the autumn

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:39.400
to see the beautiful colors of
the nature, of different greenery,

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.999
yellow, ochre, all kinds of colors were there.

00:24:44.079 --> 00:24:47.633
Surprisingly, in that country you never see all that.

00:24:47.713 --> 00:24:53.467
And because of the sun shining
so bright, it was compensated.

00:24:53.547 --> 00:25:01.266
It was compensated by this Paramchaitanya.
So the Paramchaitanya is looking after this.

00:25:01.346 --> 00:25:08.133
All these things are managed by
Paramchaitanya. I am doing nothing.

00:25:08.213 --> 00:25:11.767
I am Nishkriya. I’m just sitting down and watching.

00:25:11.847 --> 00:25:16.733
To Me nothing matters. You see,
it’s working out slowly and steadily.

00:25:16.813 --> 00:25:19.600
Ha, if you tell Me something supposing, they said,

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:22.567
“Mother, we prayed to You and
it happened.” All right, maybe,

00:25:22.647 --> 00:25:27.966
these people must have heard, around Me. Not me, you see,

00:25:28.046 --> 00:25:34.500
and they must have done the job and
for that I’m not responsible, in no way.

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:39.999
Like one lady in Mexico had a son,
was very sick and was about to die.

00:25:40.079 --> 00:25:43.233
She wrote a letter to Me, three letters she wrote

00:25:43.313 --> 00:25:48.233
that, “My son is going to die, he’s a
young fellow, studying in Harvard.”

00:25:48.313 --> 00:25:51.233
I didn’t do anything. I never wrote to her.

00:25:51.313 --> 00:25:54.767
Fourth letter came that he’s
completely cured. Now I didn’t do that

00:25:54.847 --> 00:25:59.266
because I was just sitting in one
place and how is it, it has worked out?

00:25:59.346 --> 00:26:04.433
So everything, you see, you think I do is not done by Me.

00:26:04.513 --> 00:26:09.567
Is done by this Paramchaitanya. Because
I’m also separated from you, completely,

00:26:09.647 --> 00:26:14.233
absolutely separated. So they
say, “You pray, now.” You can pray.

00:26:14.313 --> 00:26:17.300
If you pray, you pray to these deities that are around,

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:21.266
you pray to all these ganas and all that, not to Me.

00:26:21.346 --> 00:26:24.066
Because I have nothing to do with it.

00:26:24.146 --> 00:26:27.633
You see, they don’t tell Me that I
have to do this or I have to do that.

00:26:27.713 --> 00:26:31.567
So why should I tell them do
this or do that? It is like that.

00:26:31.647 --> 00:26:36.033
And in that state only we can say you are in a Sahaja state,

00:26:36.113 --> 00:26:39.266
where you don’t desire anything, you don’t want anything.

00:26:39.346 --> 00:26:44.366
I do everything. All kinds of things,
I am doing. Like the sun is doing,

00:26:44.446 --> 00:26:52.366
I am also doing in the sense that I’m
looking after things, flowers, this that.

00:26:52.446 --> 00:26:57.633
I am also receiving presents
from you, I’m receiving this from you

00:26:57.713 --> 00:27:02.033
and then see, I don’t receive anything.

00:27:02.113 --> 00:27:06.300
I don’t have anything. I have no interest in it.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:09.200
But you want to give for your joy, all right, have it.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.767
You want to put flowers, all right, you can have flowers.

00:27:11.847 --> 00:27:17.333
Even if there’s flowers or not makes no
difference to Me as a person, I’m saying.

00:27:17.413 --> 00:27:23.633
But as Your Mother I love you. All of you I love.

00:27:23.713 --> 00:27:26.767
But I don’t do anything as such
to love you. And everybody says,

00:27:26.847 --> 00:27:31.733
“Mother, You love us so much.” When?
When did I love you? I never even kissed you.

00:27:31.813 --> 00:27:35.700
But you always say I love you very much. So what is this?

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:41.600
Who is working it out, this? Is
something which is not Me, beyond Me.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:46.467
This is the state in which, once
we rise, we call it as Sahaja Stithi.

00:27:46.547 --> 00:27:52.099
In the Sahaja Stithi you think you are
doing nothing. Everything is working out.

00:27:52.179 --> 00:27:56.200
But at this stage if I tell you, you
say, “Oh, we are not doing anything.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.166
Why should we spread Sahaja Yoga? It’s not our job.”

00:28:00.246 --> 00:28:04.767
Just now, that’s not your stithi, that’s why.

00:28:04.847 --> 00:28:08.066
So you have to rise up to that state.

00:28:08.146 --> 00:28:13.999
That’s only possible when you are in the knowledge state,

00:28:14.079 --> 00:28:17.300
where you have self-knowledge,
the knowledge of the whole world.

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:21.099
But if you go beyond knowledge
then you must have seen many a times,

00:28:21.179 --> 00:28:26.667
I just say something. I just say something and it is there.

00:28:26.747 --> 00:28:30.133
I never feel vibrations of anyone or anything.

00:28:30.213 --> 00:28:33.567
I don’t feel My Kundalini, either nor any chakras, nothing,

00:28:33.647 --> 00:28:37.300
but I know, know automatically like a computer.

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:42.667
But that computer also I am not. Just
it’s trouble, it’s difficult to explain to you

00:28:42.747 --> 00:28:46.366
what is this stithi is because you have to achieve it.

00:28:46.446 --> 00:28:51.099
Once you achieve it then you are in a very subtle state

00:28:51.179 --> 00:29:00.166
and that subtle state is nothing but
bliss. But that bliss also you cannot enjoy.

00:29:00.246 --> 00:29:07.667
I don’t know how to enjoy everything.
Supposing now you say, “Jai Mataji.”

00:29:07.747 --> 00:29:13.966
I forget even you are calling Me.
I also say, “Jai Mataji,” finished.

00:29:14.046 --> 00:29:18.667
See it is such a simple thing one has to understand

00:29:18.747 --> 00:29:22.366
that the state in which one has to rise

00:29:22.446 --> 00:29:26.667
is a state where without doing
anything, everything works out.

00:29:26.747 --> 00:29:30.233
If that is your state, all right. But it’s not so.

00:29:30.313 --> 00:29:35.200
So you have to rise up to that
state by doing. First you have to do it.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:42.099
First you have to know and then knowledge
has no need, you don’t have to know,

00:29:42.179 --> 00:29:46.567
but first that has to be worked
out and brought to that level.

00:29:46.647 --> 00:29:51.633
Now Diwali has the significance
that on Diwali day, what we do,

00:29:51.713 --> 00:29:59.733
we put lights all over. So that
we put Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

00:29:59.813 --> 00:30:04.480
But does the light know about itself?

00:30:07.647 --> 00:30:16.280
Does the candle knows about itself? She
enlightens everything but she doesn’t know.

00:30:19.113 --> 00:30:26.099
Like the moon, which is giving
moonlight, does it know itself?

00:30:26.179 --> 00:30:30.713
Does he enjoy? Nothing.

00:30:32.213 --> 00:30:36.366
In the same way it happens that on a Diwali day you are,

00:30:36.446 --> 00:30:40.200
what you are doing is enlightening
people, you are enlightening them,

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:45.467
you are doing all this for them,
it’s a good idea. You must do it.

00:30:45.547 --> 00:30:52.046
But also know that you have to become the
lamp yourself which doesn’t know yourself.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:58.667
So there are two messages. The first
one is that we have to enlighten the world,

00:30:58.747 --> 00:31:01.733
we have to enlighten others. This is the first one.

00:31:01.813 --> 00:31:09.966
Then we have to become that which is
the light itself and light itself doesn’t know.

00:31:10.046 --> 00:31:13.400
Yesterday you were singing,
“You are the light,” you are this thing.

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:21.033
All right, so what? I was just saying,
‘Yes, I am the light, I don’t know Myself.”

00:31:21.113 --> 00:31:24.966
That’s the state where you don’t know you are the light.

00:31:25.046 --> 00:31:28.166
You just don’t know that. It doesn’t come into your head.

00:31:28.246 --> 00:31:32.366
Even so many times you have sung, you
have said thousand names there are, everything,

00:31:32.446 --> 00:31:38.700
but it doesn’t come into My head
that this is Me you are talking about.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:42.966
Now when I say this I don’t know how you will react.

00:31:43.046 --> 00:31:47.500
Because human beings are queer
birds, you see. You tell them something.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:54.467
Maybe that your ego might come up and
you say, “Yes, yes, I am also just the same.”

00:31:54.547 --> 00:31:58.266
There are many, many who came
like that, that, “I am higher than Mataji.”

00:31:58.346 --> 00:32:05.467
Ba, ba maybe, I don’t know. There
are many who said that, “I am Kalki.”

00:32:05.547 --> 00:32:09.966
Nowadays there’s one fellow going round
saying, “I am Kalki, I am this, I am that.”

00:32:10.046 --> 00:32:15.413
All right, doesn’t matter. You be that, very good idea.

00:32:25.847 --> 00:32:34.467
But if I say I am Adi Shakti that
means I don’t know what I am, really.

00:32:34.547 --> 00:32:37.433
I had to say because people
said, “Mother, you have to declare.”

00:32:37.513 --> 00:32:41.767
Declare what? Whatever I am, that I am.

00:32:41.847 --> 00:32:46.366
Now I find by declaration you people started

00:32:46.446 --> 00:32:50.200
growing more, so all right, have it that way.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:55.999
But there is no need for anyone to
declare anything or to say anything.

00:32:56.079 --> 00:33:03.467
That is the state one has to achieve.
But to get to that state you have to work.

00:33:03.547 --> 00:33:09.733
And work is to spread Sahaja Yoga.
You have to enlighten many lights.

00:33:09.813 --> 00:33:15.066
That means you will realize that you
are the light which is enlightening all that,

00:33:15.146 --> 00:33:20.999
and then in a subtle way you
will realize that, “I am the light.”

00:33:21.079 --> 00:33:25.500
Many Sahaja Yogis are doing
a lot of work and working it out,

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:30.433
spreading Sahaja Yoga. It’s a
very great thing that has happened.

00:33:30.513 --> 00:33:33.500
In so many countries, the way it has spread,

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:39.033
it has removed the darkness of religion which was outside.

00:33:39.113 --> 00:33:47.533
It was darkness of so many - racialism,
thisism, thatism, all it has removed.

00:33:47.613 --> 00:33:55.133
So this has worked out, the cleansing.
For you to have the clean water to swim.

00:33:55.213 --> 00:34:02.033
Once you start doing that then you realize gradually

00:34:02.113 --> 00:34:09.166
that now the sea is clean, we just
watch, we just see how it is working.

00:34:09.246 --> 00:34:13.200
I hope in your lifetime only, you achieve this state

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:21.533
where you achieve your complete
work of self-realization to others.

00:34:21.613 --> 00:34:25.733
Those who do not give self-realization
to others, who just come for the pujas,

00:34:25.813 --> 00:34:30.366
this thing, are mediocres. They cannot rise very high.

00:34:30.446 --> 00:34:33.999
This coming to puja is what, like,
you just rise higher with the puja

00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:38.066
then again you go down. But those who steadily grow

00:34:38.146 --> 00:34:42.200
will grow into this state, I am sure, in My lifetime

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:46.767
I should be able to see such people
who are such that if they stand here

00:34:46.847 --> 00:34:52.233
they emit peace, they emit light, they
emit everything. Because they are the light.

00:34:52.313 --> 00:34:55.600
They don’t have to enlighten, but they are the light.

00:34:55.680 --> 00:35:01.366
Such a stage has to be developed
and to be worked out within yourself.

00:35:01.446 --> 00:35:05.066
And this state has been described by so many poets,

00:35:05.146 --> 00:35:09.366
so many saints and everything, but they were at that stage

00:35:09.446 --> 00:35:12.533
and people thought, what is this they
are talking? They thought they were mad.

00:35:12.613 --> 00:35:15.233
Even for Christ, they thought He is to be crucified,

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:19.467
because they couldn’t understand
it. Now you are gradually growing

00:35:19.547 --> 00:35:24.266
one by one, step by step, step by
step, so now you understand this.

00:35:24.346 --> 00:35:27.066
You understand Christ, you understand all these people

00:35:27.146 --> 00:35:31.099
and at this stage you have still to work.

00:35:31.179 --> 00:35:34.600
Those who do not work for Sahaja Yoga cannot rise higher.

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:39.467
You have to work for Sahaja
Yoga, you have to spread it more,

00:35:39.547 --> 00:35:44.633
you have to work it out, enjoy each
other, this brotherhood, everything.

00:35:44.713 --> 00:35:52.733
All the qualities of a beautiful
personality should be there.

00:35:52.813 --> 00:36:00.533
Unless and until you achieve that state,
then you can only rise higher to that stage

00:36:00.613 --> 00:36:05.600
which I am describing is a Sahaja
Stithi. In that state you will be perfect.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:13.233
But you must get rid of all these things
and today is a day, also of Mahalakshmi.

00:36:13.313 --> 00:36:17.733
The first thing is, I think, this madness about money.

00:36:17.813 --> 00:36:21.667
This should be understood that it’s real madness.

00:36:21.747 --> 00:36:24.700
Those who are rich have no
money. You ask a rich man, he’ll say,

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:29.966
“Oh, I have no money.” Why?
What is this all this? This is no money.

00:36:30.046 --> 00:36:34.033
You ask the poor man, he has no
money. A rich man has no money.

00:36:34.113 --> 00:36:41.400
So it’s a kind of a greed which is
never satisfied, which never helps you.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:46.467
All these little, little things have to first drop out.

00:36:46.547 --> 00:36:49.433
Then your work should cleanse
you. In your work you will know

00:36:49.513 --> 00:36:52.300
whether you are cleansing or not. In the work you will know

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:58.700
how you are doing your work. Once
that is done, then I think I am sure

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:04.333
some of you will achieve that
state in My lifetime, in your lifetime.

00:37:04.413 --> 00:37:07.999
That’s what I want today to tell you, on a Diwali day,

00:37:08.079 --> 00:37:12.733
that we have to become subtler and subtler and subtler.

00:37:12.813 --> 00:37:17.233
We should not be influenced by outside things.

00:37:17.313 --> 00:37:24.133
Like, the outside thing is that,
some sort of a fashion starts.

00:37:24.213 --> 00:37:30.533
People who follow fashions are
stupid. They are like blind mices.

00:37:30.613 --> 00:37:35.233
Anybody can lead them into anything,
now do this, they do it. That, they do it.

00:37:35.313 --> 00:37:40.300
So if you try to follow any kind of a thought

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:43.467
which is given to us by somebody else,

00:37:43.547 --> 00:37:47.667
in that thought you’ll completely
lose yourself and you'll become,

00:37:47.747 --> 00:37:55.300
"I am this, I am Christian, I am Hindu, I
am Muslim, I am Muss leman." Stupidity.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:04.066
You are your Self. You are the
Spirit. And when you become the Spirit

00:38:04.146 --> 00:38:09.500
then you start knowing so much
and that knowledge is very important.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:15.366
This is the gap between a saint and a normal human being,

00:38:15.446 --> 00:38:18.966
which you have crossed gradually
so you know what are the problems

00:38:19.046 --> 00:38:22.433
of the human beings are and dealing with human beings,

00:38:22.513 --> 00:38:26.066
you know how to deal with them.

00:38:26.146 --> 00:38:30.999
In Sahaja Yoga only the collective
consciousness, in modern times, has come.

00:38:31.079 --> 00:38:37.400
This collective consciousness, also
the saints had, but they would not say.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.966
They would not say anything. They would not bother.

00:38:42.046 --> 00:38:46.667
All right, this fellow has this chakra,
let him go to hell. Doesn’t care.

00:38:46.747 --> 00:38:49.999
It’s not a question of not caring, but not bothered.

00:38:50.079 --> 00:38:54.999
They were sitting in a state
which was just recording, all right.

00:38:55.079 --> 00:38:58.333
An ugly man goes before the mirror, all right,

00:38:58.413 --> 00:39:02.433
if a beautiful person goes before the mirror is all right.

00:39:02.513 --> 00:39:09.700
In the same way these people
start allowing people to pass through

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.733
but we have to understand, still we have to grow.

00:39:12.813 --> 00:39:16.500
We have to still grow by working it out.

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:22.667
Those people who are working
it out and spreading it all over

00:39:22.747 --> 00:39:28.266
are the ones which are really very much there

00:39:28.346 --> 00:39:38.133
and to them, I must say, the
Paramchaitanya is just their servant.

00:39:38.213 --> 00:39:44.200
I have seen people who desire something, it works out.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.400
They ask for something, it works out.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.233
For that, now, what should we have, is the point.

00:39:51.313 --> 00:39:56.500
After getting realization, after getting
everything, what should we have

00:39:56.580 --> 00:40:02.533
that we develop is the faith. Faith in yourself.

00:40:02.613 --> 00:40:09.200
Faith in that you are the Spirit,

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:15.113
that you have the light and you have to enlighten others.

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:21.633
This faith when it grows deeper and deeper then you think,

00:40:21.713 --> 00:40:27.433
"Oh, what I am? I am the Spirit."

00:40:27.513 --> 00:40:33.033
If you are the Spirit then this whole nature is with you.

00:40:33.113 --> 00:40:39.700
I know of some Sahaja Yogis. One of them was a fisherman.

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:44.200
He was doing Sahaja Yoga work. He has tremendous faith in Me

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:50.433
and somehow he was going to
another village to do Sahaja Yoga work.

00:40:50.513 --> 00:40:58.667
When he came out of his little hut he
found it’s all full of clouds, black clouds.

00:40:58.747 --> 00:41:01.767
So he raised his hand and said,
“See now, I’m going for Mother’s work.

00:41:01.847 --> 00:41:07.099
And you dare not start raining.
You keep as you are, hanging there

00:41:07.179 --> 00:41:11.567
till I finish my work,” you see.
Because he was going by boat.

00:41:11.647 --> 00:41:15.233
And other Sahaja Yogis thought, “What is he talking about?”

00:41:15.313 --> 00:41:18.633
They all got into the boat, they reached the other village.

00:41:18.713 --> 00:41:22.433
They gave realization to others,
he finished his lecturing, everything,

00:41:22.513 --> 00:41:25.667
he came back on the shore and he entered his house.

00:41:25.747 --> 00:41:31.667
When he was closing the door, “All right,
so go ahead,” he said. And he managed.

00:41:31.747 --> 00:41:37.300
So the complete faith that this
Paramchaitanya is like your servant,

00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:43.433
is all the time waiting there to serve
you. Whatever you say will happen.

00:41:43.513 --> 00:41:49.700
But first you must have complete faith
in yourself that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:53.200
Even now I find, you see, people have some lust,

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:57.500
some sort of a horrible things in them.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:03.600
So first you must be established in Dharma.
Dharma, is, as you know, is righteousness.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.200
If you are in the righteousness, there’s no question.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.667
There’s no question that this Paramchaitanya won’t obey you.

00:42:10.747 --> 00:42:16.266
But supposing you want today
something and it doesn’t work out,

00:42:16.346 --> 00:42:20.667
then even to get disappointed
itself is not a very good thing.

00:42:20.747 --> 00:42:29.700
Disappointment also is a sign of your immaturity.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:33.179
What is there to be disappointed?

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:40.266
Maybe that that was good for you. Supposing I lose My way.

00:42:40.346 --> 00:42:45.066
I’m going this way and I lose
My way, I don’t know where to go.

00:42:45.146 --> 00:42:49.600
So I get lost, it’s all right. What is
there? Wherever I am, I am there.

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:53.099
How can I be lost to Myself? And then what I find,

00:42:53.179 --> 00:42:57.467
that I had to go that way because I was to meet somebody,

00:42:57.547 --> 00:43:01.500
I’ve been wanting to meet
somebody and meet that person there.

00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:05.633
Can you imagine? Such things happen with Me,

00:43:05.713 --> 00:43:09.433
and even if I don’t meet, so what? I was to go that side.

00:43:09.513 --> 00:43:12.767
I have to leave some vibrations, perhaps. It’s like that.

00:43:12.847 --> 00:43:20.533
So once you know that whatever you
are doing in command, full command,

00:43:20.613 --> 00:43:27.667
full faith, actually the whole authority
comes to you through your faith

00:43:27.747 --> 00:43:32.600
which word is satta in Sanskrit, meaning the truth.

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:36.667
The truth gives you the authority.
If you have the truth with you,

00:43:36.747 --> 00:43:40.099
you have the absolute truth with
you then you have the authority

00:43:40.179 --> 00:43:47.467
and the authority is such that that
authorizes you, not others, but to you.

00:43:47.547 --> 00:43:51.966
This authority that you have works and works.

00:43:52.046 --> 00:43:56.166
I've seen with simple Sahaja
Yogis, very simple uneducated also,

00:43:56.246 --> 00:44:01.433
are very powerful Sahaja Yogis,
are very powerful Sahaja Yogis.

00:44:01.513 --> 00:44:06.033
But they have one thing, is faith, complete faith.

00:44:06.113 --> 00:44:11.966
Then another word in Sanskrit is titiksha, means patience,

00:44:12.046 --> 00:44:17.567
saburi - patience. You must have patience.

00:44:17.647 --> 00:44:20.567
If you don't have patience, you want
immediately something to be done.

00:44:20.647 --> 00:44:23.366
How will you see the whole thing working out?

00:44:23.446 --> 00:44:31.200
Many people are extremely jittery and very fast-running.

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:37.300
This world is running so fast and
you are the ones who have stood out

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.999
and watching this rat race. You are not one of them.

00:44:41.079 --> 00:44:45.333
So must have titiksha, means you must have patience.

00:44:45.413 --> 00:44:49.999
So you must have faith in yourself fully and also patience,

00:44:50.079 --> 00:44:56.166
how Sahaja Yoga is working out or
how this Paramchaitanya is working out.

00:44:56.246 --> 00:45:00.433
If it works this way, all right, that
way, all right. It is some meaning.

00:45:00.513 --> 00:45:07.133
If it works this way, there's some
meaning. If it is that way it has some meaning.

00:45:07.213 --> 00:45:16.433
Now the another thing which is
important is the faith in your guru.

00:45:16.513 --> 00:45:23.366
If you have faith in your guru,
Paramchaitanya is kind to you.

00:45:23.446 --> 00:45:29.099
It’s very helpful. But if you doubt,
then Paramchaitanya also doubts you

00:45:29.179 --> 00:45:32.567
because Paramchaitanya knows you through your guru,

00:45:32.647 --> 00:45:37.667
whether it is Me or any other real guru, it’s the same.

00:45:37.747 --> 00:45:41.767
But with Me, of course, because,
you know, I’m very forgiving

00:45:41.847 --> 00:45:48.033
so people start taking liberties. With
another guru, you see, he will beat them.

00:45:48.113 --> 00:45:52.567
He’ll do all kinds of horrible
things to you if you are not there.

00:45:52.647 --> 00:45:55.633
So I’ve told you many stories
about the gurus, how they treat -

00:45:55.713 --> 00:45:59.433
good gurus - their disciples. But I forgive.

00:45:59.513 --> 00:46:02.500
I don’t say anything. Let it be, it doesn’t matter.

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:05.700
Because I think by leaving them alone only they will rise

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:08.133
and they will come up to this stage.

00:46:08.213 --> 00:46:12.433
But it happens sometimes that
it may work the other way round,

00:46:12.513 --> 00:46:21.366
that if they are forgiven, then
they take it for granted. It's all right.

00:46:21.446 --> 00:46:24.767
There is freedom, you can take it
for granted, you can do what you like.

00:46:24.847 --> 00:46:29.767
You can get lost, you can... I have nothing to say.

00:46:29.847 --> 00:46:34.667
So the faith in yourself is with patience you watch

00:46:34.747 --> 00:46:38.999
and do not get disappointed with anything whatsoever.

00:46:39.079 --> 00:46:42.500
Now, just imagine so many people have got realization,

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:45.500
so many saints in this world, have you seen?

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:50.233
Yesterday I was surprised the
way the French were singing so well.

00:46:50.313 --> 00:46:53.033
You know, first time I had to take a harmonium

00:46:53.113 --> 00:46:59.446
to teach them how to sing one
line. Half an hour I tried, I couldn’t do.

00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:06.133
The same French have reached that state of creativity.

00:47:06.213 --> 00:47:11.467
You see, all your potential
will rise. It will express itself,

00:47:11.547 --> 00:47:15.533
but be careful not to get into ego about it.

00:47:15.613 --> 00:47:20.333
Gradually it will flower and others who are surrounding you

00:47:20.413 --> 00:47:24.166
will get the fragrance of it and
they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:24.246 --> 00:47:29.467
That is the blessing at that time,
the blessing of the real Divine will be

00:47:29.547 --> 00:47:36.600
that you’ll be raised to the state which
we call as a perfect, ‘purnatva’, complete.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:41.200
That completeness will come. But you judge yourself.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:48.733
Are you absolutely one with Sahaj?
Are you absolutely dedicated to Sahaj?

00:47:48.813 --> 00:47:55.480
Or other things are more important to
you than Sahaja Yoga? Then, go ahead.

00:47:58.446 --> 00:48:02.600
There is something to be understood very clearly

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.300
that there’s no competition in Sahaja Yoga. Cannot be.

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:13.433
There’s no competition. There’s no
envy, there is no back biting, nothing.

00:48:13.513 --> 00:48:16.999
It is, you are different people. You are saints.

00:48:17.079 --> 00:48:23.366
Your style is different. You are
absolutely above all these things.

00:48:23.446 --> 00:48:28.066
You cannot be dishonest, you
cannot cheat people, you cannot do this.

00:48:28.146 --> 00:48:32.366
And if you are doing that, even
now, then please try to understand

00:48:32.446 --> 00:48:36.966
that you have still to grow into it.

00:48:37.046 --> 00:48:41.533
Some big people think they are very high up in Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:41.613 --> 00:48:46.033
It’s not so, it’s not so.

00:48:46.113 --> 00:48:53.079
If by thinking what you are, then you are lost.

00:48:53.713 --> 00:48:58.166
What you have to do is to understand “What have I done?

00:48:58.246 --> 00:49:03.200
How many people have I given realization,
to how many people have talked about it?”

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.166
People are shy, even, to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:06.246 --> 00:49:09.533
I have seen one lady was traveling
with Me. Very hot. I said, “Ba, ba

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:13.333
who is she, this one? I don’t know.”
So she told Me the name of her guru.

00:49:13.413 --> 00:49:16.733
She said, “My guru is like this, guru like that, like that.”

00:49:16.813 --> 00:49:21.166
I said, “My God, this heat coming out of
this woman and she’s talking so much.”

00:49:21.246 --> 00:49:25.567
But a Sahaja Yogi will not tell anybody what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:25.647 --> 00:49:30.133
They feel shy. They’ll have a hundred
friends, they’ll meet a hundred friends

00:49:30.213 --> 00:49:34.400
but they will never tell them what
Sahaja Yoga is. They’ll be shy to tell them.

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.433
Ah, they wouldn’t mind going to
parties, you see, if the others are drinking,

00:49:38.513 --> 00:49:42.366
they’ll say, “All right, I don’t drink.”
But they’ll not say, “I’m a Sahaja Yogi,

00:49:42.446 --> 00:49:48.333
I cannot drink, by nature I cannot
drink.” They will not say that.

00:49:48.413 --> 00:49:53.999
So this is the third point, one
has to know the announcement.

00:49:54.079 --> 00:49:57.700
You must have faith in yourself and you must announce.

00:49:57.780 --> 00:50:00.999
All the saints announced. They were killed for that,

00:50:01.079 --> 00:50:05.733
you saw how Socrates was given poison. Doesn’t matter.

00:50:05.813 --> 00:50:08.567
Nobody’s going to kill you now, in these modern times,

00:50:08.647 --> 00:50:10.667
there’s fundamental rights to exist.

00:50:10.747 --> 00:50:14.200
So nobody can kill you, take it
from Me, but you must announce.

00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.133
And the announcement should be with full faith

00:50:17.213 --> 00:50:23.233
and understanding about Sahaja Yoga, how important it is.

00:50:23.313 --> 00:50:29.233
The purpose is to transform the whole world.

00:50:29.313 --> 00:50:32.733
With your transformation the whole world transforms.

00:50:32.813 --> 00:50:39.400
It’s a very complicated thing, otherwise,
Sahaja Yoga is extremely complicated

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:46.300
because how it works. The other day, you
remember, the mike had failed completely

00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:51.066
and I was giving the lecture and still I was talking.

00:50:51.146 --> 00:50:57.033
The mike had failed but everybody
was listening to Me. What had happened?

00:50:57.113 --> 00:51:01.099
Did I enter into the ether? What happened? I don’t know.

00:51:01.179 --> 00:51:05.467
I didn’t even know that mike had
failed. I was thinking there is mike,

00:51:05.547 --> 00:51:08.966
that the way people were listening to Me,

00:51:09.046 --> 00:51:12.966
but then they told that half lecture was without the mike.

00:51:13.046 --> 00:51:19.033
And everybody was absolutely listening to Me.

00:51:19.113 --> 00:51:30.433
You see, it is something that
one has to wonder and appreciate

00:51:30.513 --> 00:51:33.966
what things are happening now, where are we going.

00:51:34.046 --> 00:51:37.133
We are going into the Kingdom of God

00:51:37.213 --> 00:51:41.533
and all the blessings, all the bliss will be on you.

00:51:41.613 --> 00:51:49.233
Then this bliss, knowledge, everything
becomes one, nothing but bliss

00:51:49.313 --> 00:51:56.633
and you are in that state of bliss which
you don’t even know, we are just there.

00:51:56.713 --> 00:52:02.767
The greatest bliss is that you don’t
know even anything, you’re just there.

00:52:02.847 --> 00:52:08.099
I hope all of you achieve that state
with this Diwali being done in Portugal,

00:52:08.179 --> 00:52:11.633
which is a special place, I think, of Mahalakshmi

00:52:11.713 --> 00:52:16.733
because She appeared here as they
say and also this swayambhu that we have,

00:52:16.813 --> 00:52:22.233
also is that of Mahalakshmi face, so
I’m sure it will work out for all of you.

00:52:22.313 --> 00:52:29.400
It’s a little subtle state I’m talking
about but it is, I have to tell you,

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.600
that one has to rise up to that state

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:37.567
and that state is very, very easy to achieve for you.

00:52:37.647 --> 00:52:41.400
It slowly, gradually it - then
you don’t have to do anything,

00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:45.266
you go into a village and everything
would be there. See, now, what happened.

00:52:45.346 --> 00:52:50.633
I went to Cairo. Everybody was saluting Me. I
was wondering, what has happened to them?

00:52:50.713 --> 00:52:54.066
I went to Leningrad, thousands came to My program.

00:52:54.146 --> 00:52:56.567
I asked them, “How did you come to My program?” They said,

00:52:56.647 --> 00:53:00.233
“It’s obvious from Your face, it’s obvious.”

00:53:00.313 --> 00:53:03.366
They just saw a small, little
advertisement in the newspaper,

00:53:03.446 --> 00:53:08.233
“It’s obvious that You are Divine.” That should happen.

00:53:08.313 --> 00:53:13.633
And then you can announce that Sahaja
Yoga is the only way, then you can announce.

00:53:13.713 --> 00:53:19.133
There’s no harm. People feel very shy to
say something to their friends and things.

00:53:19.213 --> 00:53:23.166
And you must know that all of
those who you love, who you know,

00:53:23.246 --> 00:53:27.300
will go to hell or where -
they’ll hang in the limbo or what?

00:53:27.380 --> 00:53:30.333
If you have achieved it you should pull them out also.

00:53:30.413 --> 00:53:34.266
They may not. They may not be seekers, doesn’t matter now.

00:53:34.346 --> 00:53:37.266
I think we are finished with the seekers now, must be -

00:53:37.346 --> 00:53:43.166
we must have people who are
not so seeking, it looks like that.

00:53:43.246 --> 00:53:46.713
So, may God bless you all.
