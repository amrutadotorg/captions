WEBVTT

00:02.420 --> 00:11.226
Today, we are going to worship
the Mahalakshmi

00:11.427 --> 00:17.285
which I think is very much worshipped
in this country

00:17.486 --> 00:21.325
where they worship Her as Maria

00:21.526 --> 00:27.513
and also there’s a swayambhu of Maria,
you must have seen.

00:27.714 --> 00:34.132
And also there was an apparition of Her.
First I never believed that it could be,

00:34.333 --> 00:40.545
but then after feeling the vibrations,
now I know it was true,

00:40.746 --> 00:44.301
that She did appear here in an apparition.

00:44.502 --> 00:50.127
She appeared before Me, also, you must
have seen, in a photograph.

00:55.150 --> 01:03.974
This is the principle by which you have
risen to this state.

01:04.175 --> 01:10.562
The central path of your ascent is created
by Mahalakshmi power

01:10.763 --> 01:14.530
for the Kundalini to rise.

01:14.731 --> 01:18.203
In the temple of Mahalakshmi in Kolhapur

01:18.404 --> 01:22.166
they always sing the song of “Ude, Ude,
Ambe.”

01:22.367 --> 01:30.905
So I asked the people there, “Why do you
sing Ambe’s song in Mahalakshmi’s temple?”

01:31.106 --> 01:38.066
So they said that, “We don’t know why
we do it, but is it wrong?”

01:38.267 --> 01:46.362
I said, “No, because only in the
Mahalakshmi channel

01:46.563 --> 01:52.242
Kundalini can rise and Kundalini is
the Amba.”

01:52.443 --> 01:56.583
That’s how, you see, they understood
and they were really amazed

01:56.784 --> 02:00.669
that I explained it very well ‘cause
from ancient times

02:00.870 --> 02:07.968
this song has been sung there and they
never knew why this song is sung.

02:09.877 --> 02:18.123
Coming to the point of Mahalakshmi, we have
to understand what does it do,

02:18.324 --> 02:26.297
what it’s help is that this Mahalakshmi
channel or the Mahalakshmi’s powers

02:26.498 --> 02:38.667
have created within us a proper balance,
a proper route for Kundalini to rise.

02:38.868 --> 02:44.490
Left and right has been balanced and She
is the one who creates

02:44.691 --> 02:53.948
and makes a wider path for Kundalini
to rise.

02:54.154 --> 03:01.551
This is the path of compassion and love.

03:01.752 --> 03:06.210
Through that compassion and love
She creates this path

03:06.411 --> 03:14.275
because She knows that if the path is not
wide enough the Kundalini cannot rise.

03:14.476 --> 03:20.910
Ultimately, one reaches a state where you
start seeking

03:21.111 --> 03:26.534
and when you start seeking, your
Mahalakshmi principle has been awakened.

03:26.735 --> 03:31.377
That is awakened and sometimes it is
very strong.

03:31.578 --> 03:34.884
Then you start seeking in a mad way.

03:35.085 --> 03:39.085
I am sorry to say that many are already
lost in seeking,

03:39.286 --> 03:48.375
but there are so many who have now come
to the right path and to the right ascent.

03:48.576 --> 03:53.225
The another thing this Mahalakshmi
principle does is to allow

03:53.426 --> 03:58.955
the Kundalini’s power to go to different
chakras also,

03:59.156 --> 04:04.043
to make a way to different chakras and
corrects all the chakras.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.939
She is a very flexible force, I should say,

04:08.140 --> 04:12.422
which guides the Kundalini into different
chakras

04:12.623 --> 04:17.692
and She understands which chakra needs
the help of the Kundalini.

04:17.893 --> 04:22.618
So you must have seen that when
the Kundalini rises how She pulsates,

04:22.819 --> 04:29.896
where She goes, where She shows the need
is of your awakening.

04:30.284 --> 04:37.406
All this works out because She is full
of compassion

04:37.607 --> 04:44.184
and love that you should get your absolute
truth.

04:44.385 --> 04:47.875
We have many problems as it is, you know,

04:48.076 --> 04:51.234
in Sahaja Yoga because when people
are ascending

04:51.435 --> 04:59.427
they carry on with them some of their
past stones and they cannot climb.

04:59.628 --> 05:05.455
They try then they fall, they try then they
fall, then they go up again, they fall.

05:05.656 --> 05:13.895
But today I’m going to tell you about what
is the state one has to achieve.

05:15.086 --> 05:19.778
As Shri Krishna has said it in the “Gita,”

05:19.979 --> 05:23.491
describes Stitha Pragya, the second
chapter,

05:23.692 --> 05:28.037
but it’s very difficult to understand Him,
He is not so clear cut as your Mother is.

05:28.238 --> 05:33.331
So people don’t understand what He is
saying. (Aside: “Can you close the...?”)

05:39.599 --> 05:45.464
And they ask the question, “How, how do you
reach that state of Stitha Pragya?

05:45.665 --> 05:49.657
How do you get to that stage?”

05:49.858 --> 05:52.768
But Gyaneshwara, when he wrote
his “Gyaneshwari,”

05:52.969 --> 06:00.341
he called it as the Sahaja Stithi, means
the state of Sahaj.

06:01.333 --> 06:07.358
He didn’t call Stitha Pragya. He called it
as Sahaja Stithi,

06:07.559 --> 06:14.027
meaning the state of Sahaj.

06:14.228 --> 06:20.025
So he describes the Sahaj in a very
beautiful manner and very subtle.

06:20.225 --> 06:25.249
Of course, Gyaneshwara also, very few
people understand, I think.

06:26.669 --> 06:34.275
A person who reaches that state is like
a mirror

06:34.561 --> 06:41.321
and so many faces pass over that mirror,
so many look into that mirror,

06:41.522 --> 06:50.845
so many decorate in front of the mirror,
but mirror is the same as it is.

06:51.046 --> 06:56.661
So the person who is a Stitha Pragya
or the person who is Sahaja

06:56.862 --> 07:05.806
is not bothered about what is facing him,
who is facing whom, where he is.

07:06.007 --> 07:12.956
He stays within himself. He contains
within himself.

07:13.157 --> 07:21.816
Like the sun. If the sun plays with
his different rays,

07:22.017 --> 07:26.617
he is not lost. All the rays again return
to him.

07:26.818 --> 07:36.940
In the same way, all the senses that we
have, all the senses

07:37.141 --> 07:45.061
that are there do play around, but for
a person who is in a Sahaja state

07:45.262 --> 07:49.813
it doesn’t matter, it makes no difference.
He’s not involved. He just plays around.

07:50.014 --> 07:56.956
Again, all of them come back to him.
This is a state you all have to achieve.

07:57.157 --> 08:01.540
Then you are really Sahaja Yogis.
But I still find people lost,

08:01.741 --> 08:07.463
getting money out of Sahaja Yoga, some
people lost getting out of leaderships,

08:07.664 --> 08:13.318
some are lost in getting jealousies
and envies and all that.

08:13.519 --> 08:18.438
So that means a lot of work has to be done,
still, within.

08:18.639 --> 08:24.078
There is no need to work as such if you
leave everything.

08:24.279 --> 08:27.781
That’s why I always say meditate, because
when you meditate,

08:27.982 --> 08:35.876
what happens, that all these things that
are pulling you down are finished.

08:36.077 --> 08:41.050
Gradually they disappear because you
become your Self.

08:41.251 --> 08:45.275
You get contained by yourself and you are
never bored.

08:45.475 --> 08:48.701
I am never bored. I don’t know what
boring word means, you see.

08:48.902 --> 08:54.342
When it is with you or alone, I never get
bored. What is there to get bored?

08:54.543 --> 08:59.132
If you are not involved into anything
you never get bored.

08:59.333 --> 09:04.567
Another thing is you rise above all these
things, like greed.

09:04.768 --> 09:08.802
Now people who are greedy are still
involved making money here,

09:09.003 --> 09:13.728
making money there, all that thing.
Those people who are still full of lust

09:13.929 --> 09:19.392
are still making, organizing, some things
like that.

09:19.593 --> 09:25.541
But in a Sahaj Stithi you just watch.
You are just a witness.

09:25.742 --> 09:32.033
You are not lost into anything that is
pulling you down.

09:32.234 --> 09:36.467
This state is not difficult to achieve
for you, at all,

09:36.668 --> 09:39.524
because you have crossed over your mind.

09:39.725 --> 09:43.600
Now all these things come to you through
your mind.

09:43.801 --> 09:49.209
I’ve already said that mind is a myth,
which you must accept.

09:49.410 --> 09:53.384
Myth is that this mind gives you ideas.

09:53.585 --> 09:57.098
Some people think, “Yes Mother, but -
yes Mother, but - .”

09:57.299 --> 10:02.597
This “but” is coming from your brain,
from your mind.

10:02.798 --> 10:08.389
The brain is reality, but not the mind.
The mind says “but”

10:08.590 --> 10:12.916
and then you start feeling very depressed
sometimes, unhappy,

10:13.117 --> 10:16.983
because some people feel even bad because
they are very good people,

10:17.184 --> 10:21.778
that there are so few Sahaja Yogis.
Doesn’t matter.

10:22.756 --> 10:29.752
Just watch and this watching state, this
witness state is the Sahaja Stithi.

10:29.953 --> 10:34.233
In that you become so subtle, you become
your Self,

10:34.433 --> 10:40.660
meaning so subtle that nothing can disturb
you, nothing can change you.

10:40.861 --> 10:47.596
Now see the nature as it is. You know
there are ninety-two elements

10:47.797 --> 10:51.228
and ninety-two elements, none of them
can be...

10:51.429 --> 11:00.760
say for example, you cannot make silver
into gold. Gold into silver.

11:00.961 --> 11:06.609
The atoms are so arranged that they have
certain valencies

11:06.810 --> 11:10.936
and apart from atom, even molecules
are so arranged

11:11.137 --> 11:15.402
that they have their own structure.
You cannot change.

11:15.603 --> 11:18.218
If you try to change then you will create
bombs,

11:18.426 --> 11:23.047
atomic bomb, this bomb. It’s absolutely
destructive.

11:23.248 --> 11:27.276
It’s only human beings who can change,
who can transform.

11:27.477 --> 11:33.542
Now look at the blessings that you are
a human being and you can be transformed

11:33.743 --> 11:40.136
and you can be made into a new element
that is the Self.

11:40.337 --> 11:42.995
This is the specialty of human beings.

11:43.196 --> 11:45.976
But if somebody there is a false guru
or somebody,

11:46.177 --> 11:49.185
he tries to do something, you’ll explode.

11:49.386 --> 11:53.922
I have seen people who have been to false
gurus, they still faint,

11:54.123 --> 11:57.992
they still have problems, they still get
troubled

11:58.193 --> 12:03.238
more than people who have been without
them.

12:03.439 --> 12:06.307
They are also all right now, much of them
are improved;

12:06.508 --> 12:13.000
but this is one thing one should
understand, that in one way

12:13.201 --> 12:17.388
when you are analyzing and when you are
breaking an atom

12:17.589 --> 12:22.723
or you are breaking a molecule and trying
to transform,

12:22.924 --> 12:27.887
it explodes. It doesn’t work out.

12:28.088 --> 12:33.080
The other way round is that when you
try to synthesize,

12:33.281 --> 12:36.299
then you can form anything in the nature.

12:36.500 --> 12:40.291
Like, this has now been brought out
by synthesizing,

12:40.492 --> 12:44.625
this plastic is created by synthesizing.

12:44.826 --> 12:49.781
Matter can be synthesized and can be
brought together

12:49.982 --> 12:55.812
and human beings have to get synthesized
also.

12:56.013 --> 13:04.772
They can be synthesized better than matter
because they change, they transform.

13:04.973 --> 13:13.939
Now say example, there is gold. You make
gold into ornaments, make into anything.

13:14.140 --> 13:22.331
It remains all the time, all the time gold.
Gold is gold. It is there.

13:22.532 --> 13:26.840
It is not that by changing them into
ornaments it changes.

13:27.041 --> 13:29.632
Its element is there. Gold is there.

13:29.833 --> 13:34.441
But for human beings they get transformed
when they are synthesized.

13:34.642 --> 13:43.939
This is a very big difference between the
matter and the nature and human beings.

13:44.140 --> 13:50.405
Matter, nature are different absolutely
from human beings.

13:50.606 --> 13:57.865
Human beings, once they are transformed,
it’s like a living process.

13:58.066 --> 14:04.976
They become like flowers but still it is
not that you see in the nature.

14:05.177 --> 14:11.478
It’s not the same as you see in the nature
because nature doesn’t have a mind.

14:11.679 --> 14:18.432
It doesn’t have a mind. It just is under
the control

14:18.633 --> 14:23.215
of the Divine or nature that it’s working
out that way.

14:23.416 --> 14:28.572
But here you are under your own control.

14:29.683 --> 14:33.534
Here you can control yourself.

14:33.735 --> 14:39.113
In this synthesis which is growing inside
you what you find,

14:39.314 --> 14:43.616
that you are completely in control
of yourself.

14:43.817 --> 14:46.793
You know what is happening to you.

14:46.994 --> 14:52.135
Now you start seeing yourself separating
from all these things.

14:52.336 --> 14:57.930
Some people come and tell Me, “Mother, see,
my ego is very bad, you just take it out.”

14:58.130 --> 15:02.476
He sees his ego, he sees what is
the problem is.

15:02.677 --> 15:06.898
Somebody says, “Mother, my Nabhi is
very bad,I’m still busy with the money.”

15:07.099 --> 15:13.715
He sees it. First starts the knowledge
about yourself,

15:13.916 --> 15:20.804
we call as self-knowledge. But one has
to even go beyond self-knowledge.

15:21.005 --> 15:25.245
By that knowledge, what do you do,
we have to see.

15:27.633 --> 15:33.374
When you have the knowledge, first we say
there’s no knowledge,

15:33.575 --> 15:36.823
people have no knowledge, they are
ignorant, there’s darkness, all that.

15:37.000 --> 15:43.380
Now the light has come, you can see.
You can know what’s wrong with you.

15:43.581 --> 15:50.026
Now you start separating yourself from all
those things that you see as wrong with you.

15:50.227 --> 15:55.616
You see them getting out. So many
nonsensical things there are.

15:55.817 --> 16:00.514
Like, we have jealousies, envy, greed
and lust.

16:00.715 --> 16:04.867
I mean, it’s horrible things to say
on a Diwali function, see.

16:05.068 --> 16:11.877
So the Diwali is that one by one so many
lights are enlightened

16:12.077 --> 16:14.914
and you start seeing it first.

16:15.115 --> 16:18.925
First you start seeing what is wrong
within you,

16:19.127 --> 16:22.684
and then as you see it, you don’t want it.

16:22.885 --> 16:30.308
Then you work out to get rid of it,
to become clean.

16:30.509 --> 16:35.122
Now this also knowledge disappears.

16:35.323 --> 16:42.067
You don’t have to have any knowledge.
You are there. You are there.

16:42.268 --> 16:47.096
There is no need to know about your
chakras, you are just there.

16:47.297 --> 16:51.248
At that stage nothing matters.

16:51.449 --> 16:55.892
You become just like a stone, I can say.

16:56.093 --> 17:02.637
Stone with a brain intact and a heart
intact and a liver intact.

17:02.838 --> 17:07.816
You just don’t mind anything, don’t get
upset with anything.

17:08.017 --> 17:16.660
You just enjoy the love and compassion
that’s flowing.

17:16.861 --> 17:21.616
And the ripples that come back to you,
even that is lost after some time

17:21.817 --> 17:25.966
and you are just nothing but Sahaj.

17:26.815 --> 17:31.960
That is the state people achieved. In those
days they achieved this state.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.268
But with that, what lacking happened,
that they’d get lost.

17:35.469 --> 17:39.210
They all got lost. They couldn’t do
anything to others.

17:39.410 --> 17:44.917
One person getting it, becoming great,
finished. Or two persons at the most.

17:45.118 --> 17:48.897
So now Sahaja Yoga stands, first of all,

17:49.098 --> 17:53.296
at the knowledge state, where you have
the knowledge.

17:53.497 --> 17:58.178
First, you should first of all have full
knowledge about yourself.

17:58.379 --> 18:01.700
The self-knowledge should be complete.

18:01.901 --> 18:06.245
Then in the third stage we should say
that when the knowledge is full

18:06.446 --> 18:11.501
you should get rid of all those things
that you know about yourself,

18:11.702 --> 18:16.172
which are useless, which are hampering
your progress, which you know is wrong.

18:16.373 --> 18:21.920
Like, I see some dirt falling on my sari,
I’ll just clean it out like that.

18:22.121 --> 18:27.682
Then you start separating yourself
into that Sahaja state.

18:27.883 --> 18:33.868
But still in Sahaja Yoga you develop
another dimension

18:34.106 --> 18:40.989
which is collective consciousness. That is
the modern Sahaja Yoga.

18:41.190 --> 18:46.923
In the olden days they didn’t have this,
so they just all got lost.

18:47.124 --> 18:52.354
Now you have collective consciousness
and in that collective consciousness

18:52.555 --> 18:57.832
you start feeling others, feeling
for others, compassion for others

18:58.033 --> 19:04.481
and you start working out for others.
In that also, sometimes, you know,

19:04.682 --> 19:07.761
when you are working around, you think,
"How much money I can make?

19:07.962 --> 19:14.563
What I can achieve as a leader?" -
or some sort of thing is still there.

19:14.764 --> 19:18.591
But this collective consciousness starts
growing.

19:18.792 --> 19:22.060
When it starts growing, then you become
as I said,

19:22.261 --> 19:27.333
drop in the ocean, means complete ocean,
you become.

19:28.479 --> 19:35.761
You become complete ocean. So the ocean
has its own mariadas. It doesn’t bother.

19:35.962 --> 19:39.459
It has to live with its mariadas, it lives
with its mariadas.

19:39.659 --> 19:42.406
It doesn’t want to cross any boundaries,
all right.

19:42.607 --> 19:46.399
Accept it. It will not cross its
boundaries.

19:46.600 --> 19:51.273
In the same way it happens that you are
very self-contained.

19:51.474 --> 19:56.556
You are not selfish, but you become
very self-contained.

19:56.757 --> 20:00.501
You are contained within yourself.

20:00.702 --> 20:05.309
I know many Sahaja Yogis are angry that
I have not punished many horrible people

20:05.510 --> 20:09.582
who have been troubling Sahaja Yoga.
I don’t have to bother.

20:09.783 --> 20:12.787
There’s Paramchaitanya which is doing
a lot of work.

20:12.988 --> 20:17.581
Let it look after it. Why should I bother
about anyone?

20:17.782 --> 20:22.929
You see, after all, things are working out
so why to interfere?

20:23.826 --> 20:32.606
My job is just to watch, just to see.
That’s sufficient.

20:32.807 --> 20:39.249
There’s no need for Me to kill anybody
in this lifetime or to destroy.

20:39.450 --> 20:43.682
They are destroyed by themselves.
I have told you that

20:43.883 --> 20:48.251
I need not expose people, but whichever
country I go,

20:48.452 --> 20:52.111
I find people get exposed. I run away
from there, really, sometimes,

20:52.312 --> 20:56.012
thinking, "God knows what more is going
to come."

20:56.213 --> 21:01.992
Even little attention on any country,
it just works out.

21:02.193 --> 21:07.700
Even without My knowledge, “Oh My God,”
I said, “When did I do that?”

21:07.901 --> 21:16.504
So one has to become, of course, he becomes
the power of Divine love, no doubt.

21:16.705 --> 21:22.209
He becomes the power of Divine love,
but he doesn’t handle it.

21:22.410 --> 21:25.341
Left to this Divine power which is working,

21:25.542 --> 21:31.472
which is also separated from Me, you’ll be
surprised. I am alone.

21:31.673 --> 21:36.846
Absolutely alone. Even this power is
separated from Me,

21:37.047 --> 21:40.944
but this power knows what is good for
human beings,

21:41.145 --> 21:44.982
what is good for Sahaja Yoga. It works
on its own.

21:45.183 --> 21:49.942
I don’t interfere. It’s a reflex action,
believe Me, it’s a reflex action.

21:50.143 --> 21:54.589
Maybe you might say, “Mother, you have
made it.” All right, whatever it is,

21:54.790 --> 22:00.168
but I don’t interfere with it. I don’t have
to tell anything to it.

22:00.369 --> 22:03.396
It just works and it’s working so well.

22:03.597 --> 22:07.162
I’ll give you an example. Once in England
long time back,

22:07.363 --> 22:09.292
they said, “Mother, we want to have
a very long summer.”

22:09.493 --> 22:11.389
I said, “Why do you want to ask such
things?”

22:11.590 --> 22:15.561
“No, no, Mother, we must have a long
summer, a very long summer, very - “

22:15.762 --> 22:23.271
Three or four times they said it and it was
a very long, horrible summer in London.

22:23.472 --> 22:27.193
And it’s not like India where we have
air conditioning, fans,

22:27.394 --> 22:31.688
something we have, at least hand fans.
There was nothing there.

22:31.889 --> 22:35.455
So we didn’t know. We had a little gallery,
we used to sleep in that.

22:35.656 --> 22:43.702
So we went to the shop in England and
we asked in London City, for a fan.

22:43.871 --> 22:47.751
So they said, “All right, after three
months. You order us.”

22:47.952 --> 22:52.076
After three months when it will be very
cold they will give us the fan.

22:52.277 --> 22:57.494
We said, “We don’t want any fans.”
So My daughter sent two fans by plane.

22:57.695 --> 23:00.892
And that’s how we managed. You see,
Indians, we feel very hot

23:01.093 --> 23:03.777
because we have had a lot of sun
in our country,

23:03.978 --> 23:07.294
we feel much hotter than any one of you.
The way you sit in the sun,

23:07.495 --> 23:11.338
you know, we can’t understand.
You know, in India they used to say,

23:11.539 --> 23:16.074
"An Englishman and a mad dog can only
go in the sun."

23:16.275 --> 23:19.581
So our situation is like that,

23:19.782 --> 23:22.696
that we cannot go in the sun because we
have had too much.

23:22.934 --> 23:27.917
And this summer, you see, was so
tremendous, so tremendous

23:28.118 --> 23:34.840
that after that one thing good happened.
That ochre color appeared on the leaves

23:35.041 --> 23:39.145
and then gradually the red and all that
of the autumn season

23:39.346 --> 23:43.745
was best at that time and then one Sahaja
Yogi dreamt that,

23:43.946 --> 23:47.650
“Mother asked me to drive in Her
back yard.”

23:47.851 --> 23:54.210
So he told everybody that, “Mother has been
asking me to drive in the back yard.”

23:54.410 --> 23:57.844
So I telephoned to him, I didn’t know
he had dreamt like that,

23:58.082 --> 24:02.476
that, “Can you come along for a while,
I want to go and see this autumn

24:02.677 --> 24:07.623
all over England.” So he came and we were
driving, miles together

24:07.824 --> 24:12.516
and then they told Me, “Mother, it was so,
he told us that that was My back yard.”

24:12.717 --> 24:16.927
Can you imagine that he was driving
for miles together, beautiful,

24:17.141 --> 24:23.082
just like Canada, the whole England
was filled with the beauty of autumn.

24:23.283 --> 24:28.501
So even if there’s something like that
happens, it is compensated.

24:28.663 --> 24:34.341
It is compensated and so beautiful it was,
all the people were out in the autumn

24:34.542 --> 24:39.344
to see the beautiful colors of the nature,
of different greenery,

24:39.545 --> 24:43.874
yellow, ochre, all kinds of colors were
there.

24:44.075 --> 24:47.647
Surprisingly, in that country you never
see all that.

24:47.848 --> 24:53.447
And because of the sun shining so bright,
it was compensated.

24:53.648 --> 25:01.216
It was compensated by this Paramchaitanya.
So the Paramchaitanya is looking after this.

25:01.417 --> 25:08.029
All these things are managed by
Paramchaitanya. I am doing nothing.

25:08.230 --> 25:11.800
I am Nishkriya. I’m just sitting down
and watching.

25:12.001 --> 25:16.752
To Me nothing matters. You see,
it’s working out slowly and steadily.

25:16.953 --> 25:19.581
Ha, if you tell Me something supposing,
they said,

25:19.782 --> 25:22.542
“Mother, we prayed to You and it happened.”
All right, maybe,

25:22.743 --> 25:27.835
these people must have heard, around Me.
Not me, you see,

25:28.036 --> 25:34.485
and they must have done the job and for
that I’m not responsible, in no way.

25:34.686 --> 25:39.885
Like one lady in Mexico had a son, was
very sick and was about to die.

25:40.086 --> 25:43.167
She wrote a letter to Me, three letters
she wrote

25:43.368 --> 25:48.178
that, “My son is going to die, he’s a young
fellow, studying in Harvard.”

25:48.379 --> 25:51.160
I didn’t do anything. I never wrote to her.

25:51.361 --> 25:54.790
Fourth letter came that he’s completely
cured. Now I didn’t do that

25:54.991 --> 25:59.202
because I was just sitting in one place
and how is it, it has worked out?

25:59.403 --> 26:04.396
So everything, you see, you think I do
is not done by Me.

26:04.597 --> 26:09.541
Is done by this Paramchaitanya. Because
I’m also separated from you, completely,

26:09.742 --> 26:14.173
absolutely separated. So they say,
“You pray, now.” You can pray.

26:14.374 --> 26:17.257
If you pray, you pray to these deities
that are around,

26:17.458 --> 26:21.182
you pray to all these ganas and all that,
not to Me.

26:21.383 --> 26:23.959
Because I have nothing to do with it.

26:24.160 --> 26:27.626
You see, they don’t tell Me that I have
to do this or I have to do that.

26:27.827 --> 26:31.551
So why should I tell them do this
or do that? It is like that.

26:31.752 --> 26:35.928
And in that state only we can say you are
in a Sahaja state,

26:36.129 --> 26:39.202
where you don’t desire anything, you don’t
want anything.

26:39.403 --> 26:44.305
I do everything. All kinds of things,
I am doing. Like the sun is doing,

26:44.506 --> 26:52.335
I am also doing in the sense that I’m
looking after things, flowers, this that.

26:52.535 --> 26:57.622
I am also receiving presents from you,
I’m receiving this from you

26:57.823 --> 27:01.931
and then see, I don’t receive anything.

27:02.132 --> 27:06.245
I don’t have anything. I have no
interest in it.

27:06.446 --> 27:09.099
But you want to give for your joy,
all right, have it.

27:09.300 --> 27:11.799
You want to put flowers, all right, you can
have flowers.

27:12.000 --> 27:17.293
Even if there’s flowers or not makes no
difference to Me as a person, I’m saying.

27:17.494 --> 27:23.570
But as Your Mother I love you.
All of you I love.

27:23.824 --> 27:26.816
But I don’t do anything as such to love
you. And everybody says,

27:27.017 --> 27:31.750
“Mother, You love us so much.” When? When
did I love you? I never even kissed you.

27:31.951 --> 27:35.734
But you always say I love you very much.
So what is this?

27:35.935 --> 27:41.597
Who is working it out, this? Is something
which is not Me, beyond Me.

27:41.798 --> 27:46.432
This is the state in which, once we rise,
we call it as Sahaja Stithi.

27:46.633 --> 27:51.985
In the Sahaja Stithi you think you are
doing nothing. Everything is working out.

27:52.186 --> 27:56.111
But at this stage if I tell you, you say,
“Oh, we are not doing anything.

27:56.333 --> 28:00.065
Why should we spread Sahaja Yoga?
It’s not our job.”

28:00.266 --> 28:04.787
Just now, that’s not your stithi,
that’s why.

28:04.988 --> 28:07.977
So you have to rise up to that state.

28:08.178 --> 28:13.878
That’s only possible when you are
in the knowledge state,

28:14.079 --> 28:17.219
where you have self-knowledge, the knowledge
of the whole world.

28:17.446 --> 28:21.008
But if you go beyond knowledge then you
must have seen many a times,

28:21.209 --> 28:26.686
I just say something. I just say something
and it is there.

28:26.887 --> 28:30.035
I never feel vibrations of anyone
or anything.

28:30.236 --> 28:33.541
I don’t feel My Kundalini, either nor
any chakras, nothing,

28:33.742 --> 28:37.243
but I know, know automatically like
a computer.

28:37.444 --> 28:42.673
But that computer also I am not. Just it’s
trouble, it’s difficult to explain to you

28:42.874 --> 28:46.310
what is this stithi is because you have
to achieve it.

28:46.511 --> 28:50.996
Once you achieve it then you are
in a very subtle state

28:51.197 --> 29:00.042
and that subtle state is nothing but bliss.
But that bliss also you cannot enjoy.

29:00.272 --> 29:07.683
I don’t know how to enjoy everything.
Supposing now you say, “Jai Mataji.”

29:07.884 --> 29:13.825
I forget even you are calling Me.
I also say, “Jai Mataji,” finished.

29:14.026 --> 29:18.668
See it is such a simple thing one has
to understand

29:18.868 --> 29:22.338
that the state in which one has to rise

29:22.539 --> 29:26.659
is a state where without doing anything,
everything works out.

29:26.860 --> 29:30.156
If that is your state, all right. But it’s
not so.

29:30.357 --> 29:35.133
So you have to rise up to that state
by doing. First you have to do it.

29:35.334 --> 29:42.007
First you have to know and then knowledge
has no need, you don’t have to know,

29:42.208 --> 29:46.535
but first that has to be worked out
and brought to that level.

29:46.750 --> 29:51.629
Now Diwali has the significance that
on Diwali day, what we do,

29:51.830 --> 29:59.747
we put lights all over. So that we put
Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

29:59.948 --> 30:04.556
But does the light know about itself?

30:07.746 --> 30:16.322
Does the candle knows about itself? She
enlightens everything but she doesn’t know.

30:19.116 --> 30:25.980
Like the moon, which is giving moonlight,
does it know itself?

30:26.181 --> 30:30.852
Does he enjoy? Nothing.

30:32.256 --> 30:36.310
In the same way it happens that
on a Diwali day you are,

30:36.511 --> 30:40.115
what you are doing is enlightening people,
you are enlightening them,

30:40.316 --> 30:45.438
you are doing all this for them,
it’s a good idea. You must do it.

30:45.639 --> 30:52.057
But also know that you have to become the
lamp yourself which doesn’t know yourself.

30:53.311 --> 30:58.673
So there are two messages. The first one is
that we have to enlighten the world,

30:58.874 --> 31:01.740
we have to enlighten others. This is
the first one.

31:01.941 --> 31:09.853
Then we have to become that which is the
light itself and light itself doesn’t know.

31:10.054 --> 31:13.359
Yesterday you were singing, “You are
the light,” you are this thing.

31:13.560 --> 31:20.910
All right, so what? I was just saying,
‘Yes, I am the light, I don’t know Myself.”

31:21.111 --> 31:24.830
That’s the state where you don’t know
you are the light.

31:25.031 --> 31:28.064
You just don’t know that. It doesn’t come
into your head.

31:28.265 --> 31:32.332
Even so many times you have sung, you have
said thousand names there are, everything,

31:32.533 --> 31:38.559
but it doesn’t come into My head that
this is Me you are talking about.

31:38.916 --> 31:42.850
Now when I say this I don’t know how
you will react.

31:43.051 --> 31:47.479
Because human beings are queer birds,
you see. You tell them something.

31:47.680 --> 31:54.438
Maybe that your ego might come up and you
say, “Yes, yes, I am also just the same.”

31:54.639 --> 31:58.216
There are many, many who came like
that, that, “I am higher than Mataji.”

31:58.417 --> 32:05.442
Ba, ba maybe, I don’t know. There are
many who said that, “I am Kalki.”

32:05.643 --> 32:09.855
Nowadays there’s one fellow going round
saying, “I am Kalki, I am this, I am that.”

32:10.056 --> 32:15.479
All right, doesn’t matter. You be that,
very good idea.

32:25.996 --> 32:34.424
But if I say I am Adi Shakti that means
I don’t know what I am, really.

32:34.625 --> 32:37.386
I had to say because people said,
“Mother, you have to declare.”

32:37.587 --> 32:41.799
Declare what? Whatever I am, that I am.

32:42.000 --> 32:46.338
Now I find by declaration you people
started

32:46.539 --> 32:50.110
growing more, so all right, have it
that way.

32:50.311 --> 32:55.863
But there is no need for anyone to declare
anything or to say anything.

32:56.064 --> 33:03.449
That is the state one has to achieve.
But to get to that state you have to work.

33:03.650 --> 33:09.763
And work is to spread Sahaja Yoga.
You have to enlighten many lights.

33:09.964 --> 33:14.978
That means you will realize that you are
the light which is enlightening all that,

33:15.179 --> 33:20.864
and then in a subtle way you will realize
that, “I am the light.”

33:21.065 --> 33:25.473
Many Sahaja Yogis are doing a lot of work
and working it out,

33:25.674 --> 33:30.404
spreading Sahaja Yoga. It’s a very great
thing that has happened.

33:30.605 --> 33:33.465
In so many countries, the way it has
spread,

33:33.666 --> 33:38.934
it has removed the darkness of religion
which was outside.

33:39.135 --> 33:47.527
It was darkness of so many - racialism,
thisism, thatism, all it has removed.

33:47.728 --> 33:55.028
So this has worked out, the cleansing.
For you to have the clean water to swim.

33:55.229 --> 34:01.933
Once you start doing that then you realize
gradually

34:02.134 --> 34:09.072
that now the sea is clean, we just watch,
we just see how it is working.

34:09.273 --> 34:13.129
I hope in your lifetime only, you achieve
this state

34:13.330 --> 34:21.524
where you achieve your complete work
of self-realization to others.

34:21.725 --> 34:25.743
Those who do not give self-realization
to others, who just come for the pujas,

34:25.944 --> 34:30.322
this thing, are mediocres. They cannot
rise very high.

34:30.523 --> 34:33.888
This coming to puja is what, like, you just
rise higher with the puja

34:34.089 --> 34:37.955
then again you go down. But those
who steadily grow

34:38.156 --> 34:42.101
will grow into this state, I am sure,
in My lifetime

34:42.302 --> 34:46.799
I should be able to see such people
who are such that if they stand here

34:47.000 --> 34:52.141
they emit peace, they emit light, they emit
everything. Because they are the light.

34:52.342 --> 34:55.615
They don’t have to enlighten, but they
are the light.

34:55.816 --> 35:01.336
Such a stage has to be developed
and to be worked out within yourself.

35:01.537 --> 35:04.946
And this state has been described
by so many poets,

35:05.147 --> 35:09.319
so many saints and everything, but they
were at that stage

35:09.520 --> 35:12.523
and people thought, what is this they
are talking? They thought they were mad.

35:12.724 --> 35:15.165
Even for Christ, they thought He is to be
crucified,

35:15.366 --> 35:19.425
because they couldn’t understand it.
Now you are gradually growing

35:19.626 --> 35:24.183
one by one, step by step, step by step,
so now you understand this.

35:24.384 --> 35:26.942
You understand Christ, you understand
all these people

35:27.143 --> 35:31.001
and at this stage you have still to work.

35:31.202 --> 35:34.586
Those who do not work for Sahaja Yoga
cannot rise higher.

35:34.787 --> 35:39.451
You have to work for Sahaja Yoga, you have
to spread it more,

35:39.652 --> 35:44.648
you have to work it out, enjoy each other,
this brotherhood, everything.

35:44.854 --> 35:52.771
All the qualities of a beautiful
personality should be there.

35:52.972 --> 36:00.510
Unless and until you achieve that state,
then you can only rise higher to that stage

36:00.711 --> 36:05.589
which I am describing is a Sahaja Stithi.
In that state you will be perfect.

36:05.790 --> 36:13.104
But you must get rid of all these things
and today is a day, also of Mahalakshmi.

36:13.342 --> 36:17.739
The first thing is, I think, this madness
about money.

36:17.940 --> 36:21.673
This should be understood that it’s
real madness.

36:21.874 --> 36:24.713
Those who are rich have no money.
You ask a rich man, he’ll say,

36:24.914 --> 36:29.834
“Oh, I have no money.” Why? What is this
all this? This is no money.

36:30.035 --> 36:33.902
You ask the poor man, he has no money.
A rich man has no money.

36:34.103 --> 36:41.354
So it’s a kind of a greed which is never
satisfied, which never helps you.

36:41.555 --> 36:46.454
All these little, little things have
to first drop out.

36:46.655 --> 36:49.411
Then your work should cleanse you.
In your work you will know

36:49.612 --> 36:52.249
whether you are cleansing or not.
In the work you will know

36:52.450 --> 36:58.705
how you are doing your work. Once that
is done, then I think I am sure

36:58.906 --> 37:04.273
some of you will achieve that state
in My lifetime, in your lifetime.

37:04.474 --> 37:07.867
That’s what I want today to tell you,
on a Diwali day,

37:08.068 --> 37:12.768
that we have to become subtler and subtler
and subtler.

37:12.969 --> 37:16.932
We should not be influenced by outside
things.

37:17.369 --> 37:24.049
Like, the outside thing is that, some sort
of a fashion starts.

37:24.250 --> 37:30.502
People who follow fashions are stupid.
They are like blind mices.

37:30.703 --> 37:35.141
Anybody can lead them into anything,
now do this, they do it. That, they do it.

37:35.342 --> 37:40.238
So if you try to follow any kind
of a thought

37:40.439 --> 37:43.451
which is given to us by somebody else,

37:43.652 --> 37:47.664
in that thought you’ll completely lose
yourself and you'll become,

37:47.865 --> 37:55.161
"I am this, I am Christian, I am Hindu,
I am Muslim, I am Muss leman." Stupidity.

37:55.430 --> 38:03.971
You are your Self. You are the Spirit.
And when you become the Spirit

38:04.172 --> 38:09.485
then you start knowing so much and that
knowledge is very important.

38:09.686 --> 38:15.327
This is the gap between a saint and
a normal human being,

38:15.528 --> 38:18.837
which you have crossed gradually so you
know what are the problems

38:19.038 --> 38:22.384
of the human beings are and dealing
with human beings,

38:22.585 --> 38:25.903
you know how to deal with them.

38:26.141 --> 38:30.861
In Sahaja Yoga only the collective
consciousness, in modern times, has come.

38:31.062 --> 38:37.356
This collective consciousness, also
the saints had, but they would not say.

38:37.557 --> 38:41.823
They would not say anything. They would
not bother.

38:42.024 --> 38:46.669
All right, this fellow has this chakra,
let him go to hell. Doesn’t care.

38:46.870 --> 38:49.896
It’s not a question of not caring, but
not bothered.

38:50.097 --> 38:54.864
They were sitting in a state which
was just recording, all right.

38:55.065 --> 38:58.280
An ugly man goes before the mirror,
all right,

38:58.481 --> 39:02.385
if a beautiful person goes before
the mirror is all right.

39:02.586 --> 39:09.711
In the same way these people start
allowing people to pass through

39:09.912 --> 39:12.777
but we have to understand, still we
have to grow.

39:12.978 --> 39:16.473
We have to still grow by working it out.

39:16.674 --> 39:22.660
Those people who are working it out
and spreading it all over

39:22.861 --> 39:28.209
are the ones which are really very
much there

39:28.410 --> 39:38.049
and to them, I must say, the Paramchaitanya
is just their servant.

39:38.250 --> 39:44.127
I have seen people who desire something,
it works out.

39:44.328 --> 39:47.371
They ask for something, it works out.

39:47.541 --> 39:51.173
For that, now, what should we have,
is the point.

39:51.374 --> 39:56.488
After getting realization, after getting
everything, what should we have

39:56.689 --> 40:02.518
that we develop is the faith.
Faith in yourself.

40:02.719 --> 40:09.118
Faith in that you are the Spirit,

40:09.319 --> 40:15.117
that you have the light and you have
to enlighten others.

40:17.331 --> 40:21.626
This faith when it grows deeper and
deeper then you think,

40:21.826 --> 40:27.415
"Oh, what I am? I am the Spirit."

40:27.616 --> 40:32.927
If you are the Spirit then this whole
nature is with you.

40:33.128 --> 40:39.736
I know of some Sahaja Yogis. One of them
was a fisherman.

40:39.937 --> 40:44.130
He was doing Sahaja Yoga work. He has
tremendous faith in Me

40:44.331 --> 40:50.383
and somehow he was going to another
village to do Sahaja Yoga work.

40:50.584 --> 40:58.670
When he came out of his little hut he found
it’s all full of clouds, black clouds.

40:58.871 --> 41:01.807
So he raised his hand and said, “See now,
I’m going for Mother’s work.

41:01.993 --> 41:07.002
And you dare not start raining. You keep
as you are, hanging there

41:07.203 --> 41:11.558
till I finish my work,” you see. Because
he was going by boat.

41:11.759 --> 41:15.171
And other Sahaja Yogis thought,
“What is he talking about?”

41:15.372 --> 41:18.651
They all got into the boat, they reached
the other village.

41:18.852 --> 41:22.413
They gave realization to others,
he finished his lecturing, everything,

41:22.614 --> 41:25.678
he came back on the shore and he entered
his house.

41:25.879 --> 41:31.672
When he was closing the door, “All right,
so go ahead,” he said. And he managed.

41:31.873 --> 41:37.234
So the complete faith that this
Paramchaitanya is like your servant,

41:37.435 --> 41:43.399
is all the time waiting there to serve you.
Whatever you say will happen.

41:43.600 --> 41:49.707
But first you must have complete faith
in yourself that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

41:49.908 --> 41:53.131
Even now I find, you see, people have
some lust,

41:53.332 --> 41:57.477
some sort of a horrible things in them.

41:57.678 --> 42:03.582
So first you must be established in Dharma.
Dharma, is, as you know, is righteousness.

42:03.783 --> 42:07.130
If you are in the righteousness, there’s
no question.

42:07.331 --> 42:10.689
There’s no question that this
Paramchaitanya won’t obey you.

42:10.890 --> 42:16.195
But supposing you want today something
and it doesn’t work out,

42:16.396 --> 42:20.678
then even to get disappointed itself
is not a very good thing.

42:20.879 --> 42:29.718
Disappointment also is a sign of your
immaturity.

42:29.919 --> 42:33.205
What is there to be disappointed?

42:34.931 --> 42:40.212
Maybe that that was good for you. Supposing
I lose My way.

42:40.413 --> 42:44.970
I’m going this way and I lose My way,
I don’t know where to go.

42:45.171 --> 42:49.617
So I get lost, it’s all right. What is
there? Wherever I am, I am there.

42:49.818 --> 42:52.998
How can I be lost to Myself? And then
what I find,

42:53.199 --> 42:57.419
that I had to go that way because I was
to meet somebody,

42:57.620 --> 43:01.470
I’ve been wanting to meet somebody and
meet that person there.

43:01.671 --> 43:05.651
Can you imagine? Such things happen
with Me,

43:05.852 --> 43:09.416
and even if I don’t meet, so what? I was
to go that side.

43:09.617 --> 43:12.786
I have to leave some vibrations, perhaps.
It’s like that.

43:12.987 --> 43:20.508
So once you know that whatever you are
doing in command, full command,

43:20.709 --> 43:27.697
full faith, actually the whole authority
comes to you through your faith

43:27.898 --> 43:32.585
which word is satta in Sanskrit, meaning
the truth.

43:32.786 --> 43:36.692
The truth gives you the authority. If you
have the truth with you,

43:36.893 --> 43:40.006
you have the absolute truth with you
then you have the authority

43:40.207 --> 43:47.436
and the authority is such that that
authorizes you, not others, but to you.

43:47.637 --> 43:51.854
This authority that you have works
and works.

43:52.055 --> 43:56.086
I've seen with simple Sahaja Yogis,
very simple uneducated also,

43:56.287 --> 44:01.387
are very powerful Sahaja Yogis, are very
powerful Sahaja Yogis.

44:01.588 --> 44:05.916
But they have one thing, is faith,
complete faith.

44:06.117 --> 44:11.831
Then another word in Sanskrit is titiksha,
means patience,

44:12.032 --> 44:17.577
saburi - patience. You must have patience.

44:17.778 --> 44:20.569
If you don't have patience, you want
immediately something to be done.

44:20.770 --> 44:23.327
How will you see the whole thing
working out?

44:23.536 --> 44:31.119
Many people are extremely jittery and
very fast-running.

44:31.320 --> 44:37.250
This world is running so fast and you are
the ones who have stood out

44:37.451 --> 44:40.873
and watching this rat race. You are not
one of them.

44:41.074 --> 44:45.292
So must have titiksha, means you must
have patience.

44:45.493 --> 44:49.895
So you must have faith in yourself fully
and also patience,

44:50.096 --> 44:56.074
how Sahaja Yoga is working out or how
this Paramchaitanya is working out.

44:56.275 --> 45:00.417
If it works this way, all right, that way,
all right. It is some meaning.

45:00.618 --> 45:07.012
If it works this way, there's some meaning.
If it is that way it has some meaning.

45:07.222 --> 45:16.403
Now the another thing which is important
is the faith in your guru.

45:16.604 --> 45:23.309
If you have faith in your guru,
Paramchaitanya is kind to you.

45:23.510 --> 45:28.990
It’s very helpful. But if you doubt, then
Paramchaitanya also doubts you

45:29.191 --> 45:32.542
because Paramchaitanya knows you through
your guru,

45:32.743 --> 45:37.679
whether it is Me or any other real guru,
it’s the same.

45:37.880 --> 45:41.789
But with Me, of course, because, you know,
I’m very forgiving

45:41.990 --> 45:47.903
so people start taking liberties. With
another guru, you see, he will beat them.

45:48.104 --> 45:52.547
He’ll do all kinds of horrible things
to you if you are not there.

45:52.748 --> 45:55.638
So I’ve told you many stories about
the gurus, how they treat -

45:55.839 --> 45:59.401
good gurus - their disciples.
But I forgive.

45:59.602 --> 46:02.467
I don’t say anything. Let it be,
it doesn’t matter.

46:02.668 --> 46:05.702
Because I think by leaving them alone only
they will rise

46:05.903 --> 46:08.038
and they will come up to this stage.

46:08.239 --> 46:12.411
But it happens sometimes that it may work
the other way round,

46:12.612 --> 46:21.320
that if they are forgiven, then they take
it for granted. It's all right.

46:21.521 --> 46:24.817
There is freedom, you can take it for
granted, you can do what you like.

46:25.018 --> 46:29.449
You can get lost, you can... I have nothing
to say.

46:29.999 --> 46:34.674
So the faith in yourself is with patience
you watch

46:34.883 --> 46:38.890
and do not get disappointed with anything
whatsoever.

46:39.091 --> 46:42.470
Now, just imagine so many people have got
realization,

46:42.671 --> 46:45.469
so many saints in this world, have you
seen?

46:45.670 --> 46:50.148
Yesterday I was surprised the way
the French were singing so well.

46:50.348 --> 46:52.932
You know, first time I had to take
a harmonium

46:53.133 --> 46:59.524
to teach them how to sing one line.
Half an hour I tried, I couldn’t do.

47:01.311 --> 47:06.047
The same French have reached that state
of creativity.

47:06.248 --> 47:11.457
You see, all your potential will rise.
It will express itself,

47:11.658 --> 47:15.525
but be careful not to get into ego
about it.

47:15.726 --> 47:20.288
Gradually it will flower and others
who are surrounding you

47:20.489 --> 47:24.081
will get the fragrance of it and they’ll
come to Sahaja Yoga.

47:24.282 --> 47:29.429
That is the blessing at that time,
the blessing of the real Divine will be

47:29.630 --> 47:36.592
that you’ll be raised to the state which we
call as a perfect, ‘purnatva’, complete.

47:36.793 --> 47:41.115
That completeness will come. But you
judge yourself.

47:41.316 --> 47:48.754
Are you absolutely one with Sahaj? Are you
absolutely dedicated to Sahaj?

47:48.968 --> 47:55.545
Or other things are more important to you
than Sahaja Yoga? Then, go ahead.

47:58.526 --> 48:02.607
There is something to be understood
very clearly

48:02.808 --> 48:06.248
that there’s no competition in Sahaja Yoga.
Cannot be.

48:06.449 --> 48:13.391
There’s no competition. There’s no envy,
there is no back biting, nothing.

48:13.592 --> 48:16.876
It is, you are different people. You are
saints.

48:17.077 --> 48:23.335
Your style is different. You are absolutely
above all these things.

48:23.536 --> 48:27.950
You cannot be dishonest, you cannot cheat
people, you cannot do this.

48:28.151 --> 48:32.334
And if you are doing that, even now,
then please try to understand

48:32.535 --> 48:36.824
that you have still to grow into it.

48:37.025 --> 48:41.502
Some big people think they are very
high up in Sahaja Yoga.

48:41.703 --> 48:45.914
It’s not so, it’s not so.

48:46.115 --> 48:53.065
If by thinking what you are, then
you are lost.

48:53.835 --> 48:58.092
What you have to do is to understand
“What have I done?

48:58.293 --> 49:03.129
How many people have I given realization,
to how many people have talked about it?”

49:03.330 --> 49:06.086
People are shy, even, to talk about
Sahaja Yoga.

49:06.287 --> 49:09.509
I have seen one lady was traveling
with Me. Very hot. I said, “Ba, ba

49:09.710 --> 49:13.294
who is she, this one? I don’t know.”
So she told Me the name of her guru.

49:13.495 --> 49:16.742
She said, “My guru is like this, guru
like that, like that.”

49:16.943 --> 49:21.063
I said, “My God, this heat coming out
of this woman and she’s talking so much.”

49:21.264 --> 49:25.546
But a Sahaja Yogi will not tell anybody
what is Sahaja Yoga.

49:25.747 --> 49:30.027
They feel shy. They’ll have a hundred
friends, they’ll meet a hundred friends

49:30.228 --> 49:34.358
but they will never tell them what Sahaja
Yoga is. They’ll be shy to tell them.

49:34.559 --> 49:38.392
Ah, they wouldn’t mind going to parties,
you see, if the others are drinking,

49:38.593 --> 49:42.323
they’ll say, “All right, I don’t drink.”
But they’ll not say, “I’m a Sahaja Yogi,

49:42.524 --> 49:48.288
I cannot drink, by nature I cannot drink.”
They will not say that.

49:48.489 --> 49:53.866
So this is the third point, one has to know
the announcement.

49:54.067 --> 49:57.736
You must have faith in yourself and you
must announce.

49:57.937 --> 50:00.893
All the saints announced. They were
killed for that,

50:01.094 --> 50:05.752
you saw how Socrates was given poison.
Doesn’t matter.

50:05.953 --> 50:08.573
Nobody’s going to kill you now, in these
modern times,

50:08.774 --> 50:10.672
there’s fundamental rights to exist.

50:10.873 --> 50:14.116
So nobody can kill you, take it from Me,
but you must announce.

50:14.317 --> 50:17.046
And the announcement should be
with full faith

50:17.247 --> 50:23.159
and understanding about Sahaja Yoga,
how important it is.

50:23.360 --> 50:29.159
The purpose is to transform the whole
world.

50:29.360 --> 50:32.764
With your transformation the whole world
transforms.

50:32.965 --> 50:39.343
It’s a very complicated thing, otherwise,
Sahaja Yoga is extremely complicated

50:39.544 --> 50:46.257
because how it works. The other day, you
remember, the mike had failed completely

50:46.458 --> 50:50.942
and I was giving the lecture and still
I was talking.

50:51.143 --> 50:56.925
The mike had failed but everybody was
listening to Me. What had happened?

50:57.126 --> 51:01.017
Did I enter into the ether? What happened?
I don’t know.

51:01.218 --> 51:05.435
I didn’t even know that mike had failed.
I was thinking there is mike,

51:05.636 --> 51:08.822
that the way people were listening to Me,

51:09.037 --> 51:12.840
but then they told that half lecture was
without the mike.

51:13.041 --> 51:18.924
And everybody was absolutely listening
to Me.

51:19.125 --> 51:30.380
You see, it is something that one has
to wonder and appreciate

51:30.581 --> 51:33.831
what things are happening now, where are
we going.

51:34.032 --> 51:37.038
We are going into the Kingdom of God

51:37.239 --> 51:41.504
and all the blessings, all the bliss
will be on you.

51:41.705 --> 51:49.147
Then this bliss, knowledge, everything
becomes one, nothing but bliss

51:49.348 --> 51:56.654
and you are in that state of bliss which
you don’t even know, we are just there.

51:56.855 --> 52:02.812
The greatest bliss is that you don’t know
even anything, you’re just there.

52:03.013 --> 52:07.981
I hope all of you achieve that state with
this Diwali being done in Portugal,

52:08.181 --> 52:11.579
which is a special place, I think,
of Mahalakshmi

52:11.825 --> 52:16.764
because She appeared here as they say
and also this swayambhu that we have,

52:16.965 --> 52:22.190
also is that of Mahalakshmi face, so I’m
sure it will work out for all of you.

52:22.353 --> 52:29.377
It’s a little subtle state I’m talking
about but it is, I have to tell you,

52:29.578 --> 52:32.581
that one has to rise up to that state

52:32.782 --> 52:37.571
and that state is very, very easy
to achieve for you.

52:37.772 --> 52:41.357
It slowly, gradually it - then you don’t
have to do anything,

52:41.557 --> 52:45.190
you go into a village and everything would
be there. See, now, what happened.

52:45.391 --> 52:50.631
I went to Cairo. Everybody was saluting Me.
I was wondering, what has happened to them?

52:50.832 --> 52:53.973
I went to Leningrad, thousands came
to My program.

52:54.174 --> 52:56.576
I asked them, “How did you come
to My program?” They said,

52:56.777 --> 53:00.210
“It’s obvious from Your face, it’s
obvious.”

53:00.379 --> 53:03.337
They just saw a small, little advertisement
in the newspaper,

53:03.538 --> 53:08.173
“It’s obvious that You are Divine.”
That should happen.

53:08.374 --> 53:13.650
And then you can announce that Sahaja Yoga
is the only way, then you can announce.

53:13.851 --> 53:19.037
There’s no harm. People feel very shy to say
something to their friends and things.

53:19.238 --> 53:23.064
And you must know that all of those
who you love, who you know,

53:23.265 --> 53:27.243
will go to hell or where - they’ll hang
in the limbo or what?

53:27.444 --> 53:30.262
If you have achieved it you should pull
them out also.

53:30.463 --> 53:34.194
They may not. They may not be seekers,
doesn’t matter now.

53:34.395 --> 53:37.214
I think we are finished with the seekers
now, must be -

53:37.415 --> 53:43.060
we must have people who are not so seeking,
it looks like that.

53:43.261 --> 53:46.852
So, may God bless you all.
