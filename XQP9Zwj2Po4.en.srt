1
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:20,230
I’m sorry what has happened yesterday, but I think the war has begun between the evil and good

2
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:25,780
and after all the good prevails.

3
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:39,512
In these modern times, evil used to prevail on good but now in this Krita Yuga,

4
00:00:39,512 --> 00:00:51,543
the evil will be completely conquered by good, and not only that, but good will spread all over.

5
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:18,121
The evil has the capacity to go to extremes and then to fall out of the evolutionary process completely.

6
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:31,745
Because they are blind they cannot see the good that’s why they are evil.

7
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:41,357
If they could see the good they would give up their evil.

8
00:01:41,357 --> 00:01:50,134
In our country which is a country of yoga, especially Maharastra which is the country of the saints,

9
00:01:50,134 --> 00:01:56,300
I was amazed to hear what people are up to.

10
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:05,041
One of the real source of this nonsense seems to be Rajneesh, the horrible fellow, because

11
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:13,600
he has made an exhibition here absolutely denouncing all the deities and saying all

12
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:20,240
kinds of dirty things, and I think the chief
minister of this place is also hand in glove

13
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:28,031
with him and they are all trying to prove that there is no God, there is no spirituality.

14
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:38,070
They want to establish that science is everything.

15
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:46,761
We have no heritage of science in India, we have the heritage of spirituality.

16
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:55,971
I mean nobody is known as such a great scientist
in this country.

17
00:02:55,981 --> 00:03:05,641
Nobody has made any special inventions and the way people are organising it in the name

18
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:11,451
of science, there is hardly anyone who has done anything of science.

19
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:18,750
So it’s the evil which has taken this new form of talking about science and denouncing God

20
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,807
Of course in the West also the same thing has happened to a great extent but not to that extent.

21
00:03:24,807 --> 00:03:30,295
They have not discarded everything that was spiritual.

22
00:03:30,624 --> 00:03:37,062
But here they have gone headlong, those few people who are there, very, very few, but they are there.

23
00:03:37,062 --> 00:03:45,202
So it’s a very bad growth in this country, it won’t survive I know, it cannot survive

24
00:03:45,202 --> 00:03:48,940
because this country is so full of spirituality.

25
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:56,473
In the West, because people took to science, they have lost all culture of society.

26
00:03:56,473 --> 00:04:00,450
There is no culture of society.

27
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:06,950
The etiquettes are limited to fork and spoon or how you wish each other.

28
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,832
There is no other culture.

29
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,672
It’s so outside, there is nothing deep really.

30
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:20,284
Because they have taken absolutely to the modern, or we can say that

31
00:04:20,284 --> 00:04:34,985
it's the industrial evolution of the people, they have taken to all that and have lost contact with reality.

32
00:04:35,532 --> 00:04:45,044
The culture of any country can only survive on spirituality.

33
00:04:45,044 --> 00:04:58,691
Science cannot talk of this and it has so many limitations that it cannot even answer simple few questions that are facing them.

34
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:13,754
Above all they have no idea what is love, they have no idea what is the all pervading Power.

35
00:05:13,754 --> 00:05:20,335
Now you all have felt it, and you know what it is, and you know how to use it.

36
00:05:20,335 --> 00:05:23,483
So, under these circumstances I find

37
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:34,941
that those people who are mediocres in Sahaja Yoga cannot help much  for establishing goodness.

38
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:40,701
You have to be very clean within yourself, you have to be very powerful within yourself

39
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:44,036
and you have to be extremely sensitive.

40
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:51,676
So, we are not to waste our energy, our attention onto superficial and nonsensical things.

41
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:57,488
We have to get out of it and we have to become
people who are detached,

42
00:05:57,488 --> 00:06:00,487
detached from any things which create problems.

43
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:11,005
If you take a detached view of everything you will have a kind of

44
00:06:11,005 --> 00:06:21,145
a life that will nourish your society which is now sick, is a sick society, is a decadent society.

45
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:27,529
And for that decadent society you need people who are very morally strong,

46
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:34,253
who are tremendously pure and who know everything about Sahaja Yoga.

47
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:40,763
The mediocrity in Sahaja Yoga is very common in the West, very common.

48
00:06:40,763 --> 00:06:45,661
And so much involved into their personal problems that

49
00:06:45,661 --> 00:06:55,935
I cannot understand how will they rise above this nonsensical, personal viewpoint of view.

50
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,230
So, one has to realise that the whole tree that has grown outside so much

51
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:08,807
due to industrial revolution has to seek its own nourishment

52
00:07:08,807 --> 00:07:13,133
from spirituality which is in India. No doubt.

53
00:07:13,545 --> 00:07:19,982
Spirituality without development has no meaning.

54
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:25,919
Spirituality has to have development outside otherwise it is lost in the Mother Earth.

55
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,835
It has to sprout and it has to show results, which we are showing no doubt.

56
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:36,121
In so many ways Indian Sahaja Yogis are trying to show that,

57
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:39,496
though they are rather slow about that point.

58
00:07:39,496 --> 00:07:44,752
So, it’s something funny that in the West people are rather slow,

59
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:49,651
Sahaja Yogis are rather slow about their spirituality,

60
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:58,149
and in India people are rather slow about their manifestation outside.

61
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:05,411
Unless and until we really do some dedicated effort

62
00:08:05,411 --> 00:08:09,039
it’s not going to work out.

63
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:15,885
So I hope as we have circulated letters that we have come here

64
00:08:15,885 --> 00:08:24,481
not for fun but for dedication and for our ascent and it’s a pilgrimage.

65
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:34,553
Talking loose, talking about small things, quarrelling with each other

66
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:40,909
 is out of question of course. But domination, terrible domination

67
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:45,799
of falsehood, just to think that you are leaders,

68
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:53,039
or, "Why is he leader?" you know, shows that we are not yet worthy.

69
00:08:53,039 --> 00:09:00,499
So, the worthiness of a ship is very important if it has to fight the turbulence of the sea.

70
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:07,363
If it cannot fight the turbulence of the sea then it is definitely not seaworthy

71
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:12,540
and it is absolutely useless because it cannot go across.

72
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,444
In the same way, if you have to be something,

73
00:09:15,444 --> 00:09:19,717
you have to work it out in such a manner that you really become worthy

74
00:09:19,717 --> 00:09:26,357
of crossing this ocean of illusion and that many could cross with you.

75
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:34,594
As in India they have started at every place,
at every home, at every family, a center.

76
00:09:35,362 --> 00:09:38,661
If they invite people, they talk about nothing
but Sahaja Yoga.

77
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:44,586
Now you can go all out to talk about it, I give you permission to tell them that I have come

78
00:09:44,586 --> 00:09:47,291
there’s nothing to hide.

79
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:55,963
And you have to go and open the doors

80
00:09:55,963 --> 00:10:05,024
of many churches and many temples and many organisations and tell them that I am there.

81
00:10:05,024 --> 00:10:08,924
Now the time has come, you can see it so clearly, it’s so obvious.

82
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:14,345
First, I used to say, "I would not go to the newspapers, this not good that’s not good,

83
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:16,281
let us work it out."

84
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:19,779
But it has come now so much, that I have to say things and I am going to say them,

85
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:23,735
very openly, I am going to say them.

86
00:10:23,735 --> 00:10:26,752
But I want all of you to be such

87
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:37,655
that nobody should point out a finger at you to say, "Oh, this is a Sahaja Yogi.

88
00:10:37,655 --> 00:10:41,786
And how this Sahaja Yogi is behaving."

89
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:49,938
If somebody is stupid and not working it out, it's better to get rid of such a person.

90
00:10:49,938 --> 00:10:54,722
Or else help that person and tell him that, "You have to come up.

91
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:58,384
You can’t be here, we don’t want mediocre people here.

92
00:10:58,384 --> 00:11:05,212
We want some very extraordinarily, pure people.“

93
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:08,250
The purity is the main point which we have to have.

94
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,851
Once you are pure you don’t have to worry, then I look after you.

95
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:19,827
But the purity of mind, purity of heart and the purity of your attention, these three things are very important.

96
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:25,581
When it works out, you’ll be surprised collectivity will grow in no time.

97
00:11:25,581 --> 00:11:32,477
Is a tendency among Sahaja Yogis also, still, to go back to the same materialism

98
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:38,622
and to try to have your own house, your family, your
children- sort of a nonsense.

99
00:11:38,622 --> 00:11:43,330
We have to be in the ashrams and we have to work it out,

100
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:48,042
we have to work it out very beautifully that we all live very happily in the ashram.

101
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:55,051
But I find still people cannot work it out that way.

102
00:11:56,191 --> 00:11:59,904
They are more concerned about their jobs, concerned about their things.

103
00:11:59,904 --> 00:12:03,704
Once you live in the ashram I’ll see that you get everything.

104
00:12:03,938 --> 00:12:12,348
But if you do not want to have the blessings
of God, how can anybody help you?

105
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:14,938
So, tremendous sacrifice is needed.

106
00:12:14,938 --> 00:12:18,684
Of course, as you know in Sahaja Yoga I don’t need any money from you at all,

107
00:12:18,826 --> 00:12:26,219
but sacrifice is very important, and sacrifice of nonsensical ideas that you have.

108
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,300
In every way we have to show that we are Sahaja
Yogis.

109
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,119
The way you dress up, the way you live, the way you think, the way you behave,

110
00:12:34,119 --> 00:12:36,375
the way you have relationships with each other

111
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:39,053
and the way you lead your married life

112
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:44,025
and the way you look at your children.

113
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:51,392
Unless and until you have purity the light of love will not shine,

114
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:54,572
the light of love will not shine.

115
00:12:54,572 --> 00:12:59,931
You have to absorb the light of love within yourself.

116
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:04,052
But you cannot unless and until you are a pure personality.

117
00:13:04,052 --> 00:13:11,889
And that pure personality has to develop by your meditation, by working hard, it’s a question of few years.

118
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:15,729
In ten years we can change the whole world,
in ten years!

119
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:18,441
But you have to be really very dedicated.

120
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:28,995
It is you who has to change, not Me.

121
00:13:28,995 --> 00:13:32,875
You have to work it out, not Me.

122
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:39,127
I have done my level best but within ten years it should be possible that every Sahaja Yogi

123
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:42,706
should become a tremendous force of Sahaja Yoga.

124
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:46,216
So, please try to avoid all those who are mediocres.

125
00:13:46,216 --> 00:13:52,368
If you find mediocrity, the leaders must go all out to correct them,

126
00:13:52,368 --> 00:13:55,132
all out to tell them off. Don’t tolerate.

127
00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:59,611
You don’t have to be very mild on this point.

128
00:13:59,611 --> 00:14:06,342
You have to tell them frankly that, "See now, you are an extremely mediocre person for Sahaja Yoga.

129
00:14:06,342 --> 00:14:09,626
It's not meant for mediocres.

130
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:13,655
It's not meant for foolish people, it's not meant for stupid people,

131
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:21,115
it’s meant for something who are ready to sacrifice anything for the sake of truth.“

132
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:25,664
These people are saying that, "Why don’t you go the way of science?"

133
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:30,372
I say, "Why don’t you go the way of truth?"

134
00:14:30,372 --> 00:14:32,572
Take to truth.

135
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:37,294
Science is not truth. Today it might appear, tomorrow it disappears.

136
00:14:37,891 --> 00:14:41,793
Today you may think it is correct but every hypothesis is challenged,

137
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:46,557
every law is challenged, that’s no law.

138
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:50,673
You have to use Sahaja Yoga in every practical life, everywhere.

139
00:14:50,673 --> 00:14:53,293
But in no way you have to be fanatic about it.

140
00:14:53,415 --> 00:14:58,617
Like I have seen some people start giving vibrations

141
00:14:58,617 --> 00:15:04,791
or they start moving their hands for bandhans,

142
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,600
even if I am sitting, they are doing like that.

143
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:15,400
There is no stupidity about it, it has to be very dignified, decent and decorous.

144
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:22,676
But for that we need really people of quality.

145
00:15:22,676 --> 00:15:27,143
And a complete obedience is needed I must say.

146
00:15:27,704 --> 00:15:33,727
I have told Indian people that time that they must have a proper case done for them.

147
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:36,927
They just didn’t listen to Me that time, they said, "Mother, why do you want,

148
00:15:36,927 --> 00:15:39,335
you know, you'll be in trouble and all that".

149
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:44,098
If they had listened to Me there would have been no trouble today.

150
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:50,427
But you must listen to Me what I say, don’t give Me explanations, don’t give Me logic,

151
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:53,207
but I know everything you know that.

152
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:57,640
I know everything.

153
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:02,057
Now we have something good for you is the list of the marriages.

154
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:06,717
But marriage is not such an important thing that you think about.

155
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:13,181
It’s not such an important thing for you that you dedicate all your attention to that.

156
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:17,325
It’s just by the way, because you have to have a marriage, that’s why.

157
00:16:17,325 --> 00:16:20,185
There’s no need even to have sometimes.

158
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:28,437
But you have to have it, and then letters after letters about your marriages, about your children, I just don’t want to read that.

159
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:32,624
Nothing about Sahaja Yoga.

160
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:38,922
If you are detached, whatever may be the quality of your wife, you will not fall,

161
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:41,815
whatever may be the quality of your husband, you will not fall.

162
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:51,231
So one has to be little concerned that: what are we doing?

163
00:16:51,231 --> 00:16:53,752
What have we achieved?

164
00:16:54,121 --> 00:16:59,880
What are we going to give to the world?

165
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:10,141
For Me, you are my instruments. I don’t have to ask anybody else.

166
00:17:10,141 --> 00:17:13,733
You are my instruments and you have to work it out.

167
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:19,224
You are not for Me useless people, I worked very hard with you, very hard.

168
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:22,756
So please don’t waste my energies also

169
00:17:22,756 --> 00:17:29,275
and try to become very good Sahaja Yogis in every way that is possible,

170
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:35,640
in every way you should be dedicated, in every way try to be something

171
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,610
of very great qualities.

172
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:42,171
Now you have seen how people have becoming violent and there is a violence on.

173
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:47,610
Of course, this may not continue but it’s one of the signs that we have to be prepared

174
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:53,543
to be very strong people, very strong,

175
00:17:53,543 --> 00:17:55,313
and that will work out I’m sure.

176
00:17:55,313 --> 00:18:01,211
They threw about 400 stones at least, maybe more according to the police report

177
00:18:01,211 --> 00:18:03,818
and very few people were hurt.

178
00:18:04,221 --> 00:18:06,121
What does that mean?

179
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:11,290
That there is somebody who is avoiding all these troubles.

180
00:18:15,282 --> 00:18:20,060
Regarding our tour further, now I have decided we will not go to Atith

181
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:24,683
because there are- the commissioner, the ESP told Me that it is better not to go,

182
00:18:24,683 --> 00:18:28,099
it's very- these people are very bad and they are criminals.

183
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:31,989
So, now until the election comes in, they will be behaving like this manner.

184
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,424
After the election of course they will be put down.

185
00:18:35,424 --> 00:18:41,930
So you should go by the understanding of the time and

186
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,860
directly to Sangli, so we’ll go to Sangli, we will have a puja there, you can do shopping whatever you like

187
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:53,060
and then from there will be going to Ganapatipule.

188
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,446
But it’s not fun, it’s not fun.

189
00:18:57,446 --> 00:19:01,721
It is our development.

190
00:19:01,721 --> 00:19:06,836
Otherwise you will be coming to India, going back the same, empty handed.

191
00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:13,159
I want you, everyone, to be extremely active in your own sphere of life,

192
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:14,149
talk about Sahaja Yoga.

193
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:19,658
You must wear my badges, you must wear my rings, you must wear my necklaces

194
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:26,030
so that people ask you “Who is this?” Then you should say, “She is the Holy Ghost”.

195
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,385
You can say, "We think she is the Holy Ghost".

196
00:19:29,385 --> 00:19:31,691
Let us see what happens.

197
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:39,808
So, it’s a serious thing that I felt that I have to talk to you

198
00:19:39,808 --> 00:19:46,211
and that we have to be very, very careful about how we look at ourselves.

199
00:19:46,211 --> 00:19:50,510
We have to be aware, we have to be aware about ourselves and what is happening.

200
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:54,354
I’ve been telling you this many a times, we have to be aware as to what we are

201
00:19:54,354 --> 00:19:55,489
and what is happening.

202
00:19:55,489 --> 00:20:01,908
But if your jobs are important, everything else is important how are you going to work out Sahaja Yoga?

203
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:07,923
So, there has to be awareness and with your awareness the light will spread.

204
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:11,293
But it’s not silent, you have to talk about it.

205
00:20:13,352 --> 00:20:19,067
Eloquence is needed, it has to be eloquent, all your light has to talk,

206
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:25,537
the light has to say, the light has to express and has to
be very confidently done.

207
00:20:26,081 --> 00:20:33,466
Let us see now after going from this tour how far people establish new things.

208
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:40,111
So far, what my own opinion is,  that there are 50% of Sahaja Yogis

209
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:43,822
in the West are still quite mediocre

210
00:20:43,822 --> 00:20:47,945
and 25% of them are just there to take advantage.

211
00:20:47,945 --> 00:20:51,382
If they can get something free, they would like to do it.

212
00:20:51,721 --> 00:20:53,793
25% people are like that.

213
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:57,175
It’s very sad but it is so.

214
00:20:57,175 --> 00:21:02,448
But I must say Indians are poor people but
they will not do anything,

215
00:21:02,448 --> 00:21:06,201
they will never take anything free from Me, nothing.

216
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:09,076
They will not, they are very self-respecting.

217
00:21:09,076 --> 00:21:11,507
And that is what we have to develop, that self-respect.

218
00:21:12,331 --> 00:21:17,042
Like I have seen I had a house in Hounslow, everybody went there and stayed there free.

219
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:20,615
Now we have a house there in Shuddy Camp where
everybody goes,

220
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:24,610
who has no job goes and stays there. It’s such a nonsensical thing.

221
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,757
So, I’m even afraid to start any ashram in London because same thing will start.

222
00:21:29,757 --> 00:21:32,913
If they can take advantage they would like to be there.

223
00:21:32,913 --> 00:21:35,624
Even a spoon they would like to carry like that.

224
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:39,378
It’s a shameless thing for a Sahaja Yogi to behave like that I think.

225
00:21:39,528 --> 00:21:48,338
We have to have full self-respect and we must understand that we have to sacrifice, to do something about it.

226
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:54,476
Because this is the last leg, I would say, when I will be talking to you about all these things

227
00:21:54,476 --> 00:22:03,447
and in the beautiful atmosphere here on the bank of Krishna river.

228
00:22:04,214 --> 00:22:10,866
We have to understand that the river flows, it makes a sound,

229
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:14,971
it makes a sound to show that she- it exists.

230
00:22:15,889 --> 00:22:23,209
But we are not only rivers, we are all the mountains, rivers, everything of the universe we are.

231
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:31,581
And our manifestation is like a big zero as if the Mother Earth has been emptied out.

232
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:39,754
It is time that we should watch ourselves and see ourselves, what’s wrong with us.

233
00:22:39,754 --> 00:22:41,157
Very important.

234
00:22:41,157 --> 00:22:47,365
I had to say this once again and again,

235
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:51,203
but I don’t like to say these things because I love you so much

236
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:55,084
and I care for you so much and you people also love Me.

237
00:22:55,084 --> 00:22:59,184
But loving Me is not sufficient, you have to love yourself and respect yourself.

238
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:01,865
Only your Self is going to work out.

239
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,699
As Shivaji Maharaj said, "Swa-dharma rajya"

240
00:23:05,699 --> 00:23:10,954
"You must develop the religion of your Spirit".

241
00:23:11,245 --> 00:23:16,147
That’s what we have to do, is to develop the religion of our Spirit.

242
00:23:16,147 --> 00:23:25,522
And once it happens, we can get the whole world completely emancipated.

243
00:23:25,522 --> 00:23:32,224
This is our work and if we fail then it is the responsibility of Sahaja Yogis and nobody else

244
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:39,154
So, for everyone I have to tell you that I don’t have to please you, you have to please me.

245
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:48,121
For a small thing people react, for a small thing they feel bad.

246
00:23:48,121 --> 00:23:51,930
If I don’t smile at somebody they feel bad.

247
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,617
In little, little things they feel bad and they react.

248
00:23:55,617 --> 00:23:58,093
If I say anything, they react.

249
00:23:58,093 --> 00:24:00,323
So how can anything go into you?

250
00:24:00,446 --> 00:24:04,666
If it is such a convexity, how will you absorb it?

251
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:11,194
It is important that we should try to absorb
with humility, with understanding.

252
00:24:11,194 --> 00:24:14,508
Now you are Sahaja Yogis, you know I am Adi Shakti,

253
00:24:14,508 --> 00:24:17,433
you have had photographs, you have known that I am Adi Shakti.

254
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:19,581
But how much are we absorbing?

255
00:24:19,581 --> 00:24:21,579
How much we are taking within ourselves?

256
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:26,331
This work is much more than any one of the incarnations had to do.

257
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:31,198
It's much more than Christ, is much more than Rama, much more than Shri Krishna’s.

258
00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:35,614
So create such great people among you.

259
00:24:35,614 --> 00:24:41,638
Because I have the power, only thing, you have to have the absorption power,

260
00:24:41,638 --> 00:24:43,314
the acceptability.

261
00:24:43,314 --> 00:24:49,145
But if you run after something very cheapish and something very frivolous, it’s impossible.

262
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:58,675
You have to ask for your depth and you have to take in, whatever is emitting from my being.

263
00:24:58,675 --> 00:25:02,110
I hope now you all will take it up seriously.

264
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:05,400
Do your meditation every morning whatever maybe the time.

265
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:11,961
Every morning we have to do the meditation and we have to see that we finish our work in the night

266
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:15,309
and then we do little meditation and then sleep off.

267
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:22,062
Without meditation you cannot grow and that’s why everything doing you have to know that you have to get up in the morning,

268
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:26,022
do your meditation and then you can take to your work.

269
00:25:26,022 --> 00:25:28,741
Daytime if you want, you can rest for a while.

270
00:25:28,741 --> 00:25:32,849
Now we are in such a place that we have time to rest for a while,

271
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:35,976
but morning time you have to get up whatever time you sleep.

272
00:25:35,976 --> 00:25:40,343
You have to conquer your sleep a little bit, it gives you lot of lethargy.

273
00:25:40,343 --> 00:25:45,293
Last night I don’t think I slept before 3 o’clock or something like that

274
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:49,272
and then the whole day I’ve been busy writing reports, this, that.

275
00:25:49,445 --> 00:25:55,025
If I can manage at this age, at your age you should be able to manage something like that.

276
00:25:55,176 --> 00:26:00,227
We have no time to sleep, we have no time to discuss, argue or to eat our food.

277
00:26:00,489 --> 00:26:05,363
We have only time to meditate, that’s all.

278
00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:12,399
I wish all of you absorb my saying and understand it without reacting to it.

279
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:13,782
Please do not react.

280
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:16,610
Don’t think, "Mother is trying to chastise you". No.

281
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:21,871
I’m trying to help you to grow, this is the way you grow sometimes very fast.

282
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:25,555
So it’s just your growth I am worried about and nothing else.

283
00:26:25,555 --> 00:26:26,974
May God bless you all.

284
00:26:26,974 --> 00:26:32,073
I was very happy the way you were singing all the songs and the way you expressed yourselves.
