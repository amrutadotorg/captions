1
00:00:03,213 --> 00:00:07,240
But first of all, people do not understand that
you have to work it

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,003
through your heart and not\hthrough your brain.

3
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:14,350
When we have to work out
things through our brain, we try to develop\h\hour brain,

4
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:16,057
isn’t it?

5
00:00:16,137 --> 00:00:19,558
By memorizing, by practising\hsomething,

6
00:00:19,638 --> 00:00:23,573
teaching our brain how to think, how to go this way that way.

7
00:00:23,953 --> 00:00:25,978
We try to train our brain.

8
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:29,377
Now, we have to train our heart in Sahaja Yoga.

9
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:33,345
And to train our heart in Sahaja Yoga,

10
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:36,054
one has to\hknow, first of all,

11
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:41,793
that it is enveloped either by ego or by superego.

12
00:00:42,212 --> 00:00:45,602
The limbic
area actually represents the heart.

13
00:00:47,082 --> 00:00:53,612
And if there is ego, heart will always be
so-called,

14
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:57,806
it will not be the real heart that\hwill be working, but it’s only mental,

15
00:00:57,886 --> 00:00:59,280
mental\hprojection.

16
00:00:59,514 --> 00:01:02,333
And you will feel that, “I’m doing\h\hit from my heart.”

17
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:03,975
But it’s not true.

18
00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:08,574
Now then,\hsupposing,
 what should we do if we have ego?

19
00:01:09,674 --> 00:01:14,611
You might say, you should try to sort of tell yourself
that, "That’s not good and this and that

20
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:18,825
and all\hkinds of mental suggestions"

21
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,961
or autosuggestions\hor this –

22
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:24,661
the way psychiatrists know that give you suggestions.

23
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:27,888
That’s again mental.

24
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:30,949
So,\hthat’s not the way it is going to work out.

25
00:01:32,013 --> 00:01:35,309
We must understand that for that what we have to
do is to

26
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:37,800
raise the left side and put it to the right side.

27
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:39,587
There’s no other way out.

28
00:01:39,674 --> 00:01:43,549
You have to just work it out with your hands, your hands are working it out

29
00:01:43,629 --> 00:01:48,040
and not your brain.\hSo use your hands

30
00:01:48,214 --> 00:01:50,256
and the methods of Sahaja Yoga.

31
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:57,777
Now, everyone must have a regular sitting
in the water

32
00:01:57,857 --> 00:02:00,025
every day, that’s important.

33
00:02:00,393 --> 00:02:04,123
Every morning you must do your meditation.

34
00:02:04,203 --> 00:02:10,100
You have to know that Sahaja Yoga is to
be worked out, it‘s not to be thought out.

35
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:17,135
You just cannot think about it. Whatever
you may try to do through your thought,

36
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:22,135
you cannot achieve any results in Sahaja Yoga. You\hhave to use your hands, you have to use your feet,

37
00:02:22,413 --> 00:02:26,793
\h\hyou have to soak your feet in the water because
water is the ocean.

38
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:32,149
All these five chakras – or,\h\hsay, six chakras

39
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,272
which are — I say five
because the…

40
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:41,041
one is the Mooladhara Chakra, which is the seven

41
00:02:41,121 --> 00:02:44,929
and the topmost is the brain.

42
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:49,180
So, in between five chakras which
are there —

43
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,880
are to be handled fully

44
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:58,028
with the\hidea that they are basically made of matter.

45
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:03,925
And these five elements constitute

46
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:08,663
the body of these chakras.

47
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:13,816
Now, these chakras, if\hthey are to be corrected,

48
00:03:13,896 --> 00:03:19,525
we have to correct them by taking out all the problems of these chakras

49
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:24,153
into the elements from which they’re coming.

50
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:29,657
For example, a person who is
a very right-sided person,

51
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,729
so, he has to give a balance by the left-side.

52
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:40,690
Of course, raising with the hand is
all right. But what about the element?

53
00:03:41,025 --> 00:03:45,973
Right-sided person has all the elements\hwhich give heat:

54
00:03:46,198 --> 00:03:48,135
we can say, the light,

55
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,889
we can say, the fire.

56
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:54,282
So, for people who are\hright-sided,

57
00:03:54,493 --> 00:03:57,722
the light is not going to help much.

58
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:04,370
Like, if you put the light before the photograph,
and those who are ego-oriented people

59
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,875
— if you just use the light, it’s not going to work out.

60
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:11,874
So, what is going to work out is the Mother Earth

61
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:17,861
and the water element, which is cooling.

62
00:04:18,256 --> 00:04:24,268
Even ice\his very helpful to people who are right-sided.

63
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:37,091
So, all cooling effects should be used
for correcting your right-sidedness,

64
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:39,638
so that you cool it down.

65
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,521
Same about food.

66
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:47,870
In food, those who are right-sided people should
take to foods

67
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:53,127
which are left-sided, that is carbohydrates, means they should become partly\hvegetarians,

68
00:04:53,207 --> 00:04:55,958
or quite a lot of vegetarians.

69
00:04:57,029 --> 00:05:01,544
And should eat things at the most like chicken,

70
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:07,135
but\hnot fishes, not seafoods because they are all hot.

71
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,059
That’s how you treat your material side of your
chakras.

72
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:17,488
Now, the left-sided people should use, again,

73
00:05:17,587 --> 00:05:20,743
the "deepam" is the light or the fire

74
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:25,081
to\hcorrect their left-side.

75
00:05:25,447 --> 00:05:31,944
Also, in food such people should take more to nitrogenous, means protein

76
00:05:32,242 --> 00:05:37,246
and\hfoods like that. They should take more proteins.

77
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,523
Now, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

78
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:46,681
the basic\hthing is Kundalini.

79
00:05:46,836 --> 00:05:52,914
And the Kundalini, as I have told you, is the pure desire.

80
00:05:53,118 --> 00:05:57,718
Again, listen\hto it carefully: pure desire.

81
00:05:57,943 --> 00:06:01,343
That means all other desires are impure.

82
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:03,393
There’s only one pure\hdesire.

83
00:06:03,473 --> 00:06:06,655
And that is to be one with the Divine,

84
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:12,274
one with the Brahma, one with God — that’s the
only pure desire.

85
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:16,181
All other desires are impure.
