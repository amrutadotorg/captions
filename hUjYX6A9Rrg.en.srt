1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:21,000
Today we are celebrating Sahastrara day. Perhaps
we have not realised what a day it must have

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:37,040
been. Without opening the Sahastrara, God
Itself was a myth, religion itself was a myth,

3
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:49,050
and all talk about Divinity was a myth. People
believed in it but it was just a belief. And

4
00:00:49,050 --> 00:01:10,259
the science, as it was put forward, was about
to obliterate all the value system, all the

5
00:01:10,259 --> 00:01:21,240
proof of God Almighty.
If you see in the history, one after another,

6
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:31,079
when science established itself, the people
who are so-called in charge of the helm of

7
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:40,340
affairs in religion, in different religions
tried to cope with the findings of science.

8
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:49,289
They tried to show that: “All right, if
it is said this much – is in the Bible,

9
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:59,990
and if it is wrong we should correct it.”
Especially Augustine did that. And it started

10
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:11,340
looking as if it’s all a stupidity this,
these scriptures were just mythical. At least

11
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:27,040
the Koran itself, though, had lots of things
which were describing the biology of today.

12
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:36,670
They could not believe that human beings were
specially created by God. They thought it

13
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:45,030
was a matter of chance that one after another
the animals acquired a situation by which

14
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:58,790
they became human beings. Thus all the time
Divinity was challenged and there was no way

15
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:10,680
of giving a proof of whatever is said in the
Bible or in the Koran or in the Gita or in

16
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:24,400
the Upanishadas or in the Torah. Any one of
these things could not be proved because it

17
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,370
was still just a faith.
Very, very few people got their Realisation

18
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,580
and when they talked, people did not believe
them and thought that they are just trying

19
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:42,870
to say something which they are using to propound
their own theories.

20
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:56,470
So the whole thing became a kind of dead science.
There was no science of religion. People started

21
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:02,540
thinking that: what’s the use of following
these ten commandments or these strict rules

22
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:11,900
of life, because by following that you gain
nothing. You lose all the fun of the life.

23
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:21,489
And why think of gaining some punyas also.
And that is how all the time there was a big

24
00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:31,830
derailment of human value system.
Also these organised religions, this monolithic

25
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:41,039
organised religions started taking to [a]
course of gaining power, or gaining money,

26
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:46,090
because they thought that’s the only way
you can control people and can go on. They

27
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:53,520
were least bothered as to deliver the goods,
whatever have been described in the Bible.

28
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,961
Bible of course was tampered [with] very much
and has been lot of changes in that. And a

29
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:12,389
person like Paul, and Peter, who joined together,
tried to spoil most of the Truth. Though Koran

30
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:20,160
was not so much touched but still is dealt
with more the right side, with the reproductive

31
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,860
system and all those things. And so many things
are still ambiguous.

32
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,730
Now simultaneously two things have happened,
I don’t know if you are aware of it or not.

33
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:42,229
First thing that has happened is that now
we have a new science of microbiology in which

34
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:54,229
we have discovered that every cell has got
a DNA tape. Every cell has got a program in

35
00:05:54,229 --> 00:06:05,819
it. As we have in a computer a chip, every
cell has got a tape in it, in a way, that

36
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:11,909
it is programmed. And according to that program
a development takes place. Now imagine the

37
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:14,499
intricacy of the whole thing!

38
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:28,069
So many computers are already programmed and
all these cells have these in them. So a very

39
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:33,650
mysterious sort of a thing has come up before
the scientists and they cannot explain it.

40
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:39,389
They cannot explain many things but one of
them is this.

41
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:47,490
Now what Sahaja Yoga has done is that it has
proved that it is the Will of God, it is the

42
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:59,029
desire of God, the Will of God, which is doing
all the work. And it has been proved.

43
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:07,020
All these Chaitanya, Adi Shakti, is nothing
but the Will of God. And Will of God is the

44
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:14,099
One is working out everything very harmoniously.
I don’t know if some of you must have read

45
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:22,050
my book, first book, where I have described
how this Earth was created. There was a bang,

46
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:33,639
but it was very harmonious, and how it developed
is through the Will of God. So everything

47
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:41,099
was done in a way that God’s will was working
it out.

48
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:48,169
Now the Will of God you are feeling it, on
your finger tips. After Realisation, now,

49
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:56,680
you have discovered the the absolute science,
which is the Will of God, which is an absolute

50
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:02,189
science. You people know that we have cured
people through Sahaja Yoga. You also know

51
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:08,159
giving bandhan, and all that, things work
out. So many things work out automatically

52
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:11,949
after Realisation that people don’t want
to believe.

53
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,649
In the beginning people would not believe
when the scientists told them something, but

54
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:22,899
now it is, you can see, the science is always
in the flux, all the time changing. One theory

55
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:29,809
is again challenged. Another theory’s again
challenged. But Sahaja Yoga has exposed you

56
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:38,650
to that Great Truth of science which cannot
be challenged, which is all there.

57
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:49,650
So anybody who comes out with any new proposal
about defaming God, or saying that there is

58
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:55,330
no God, we can prove, not [only] that there
is God, but that everything, the creation

59
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:02,400
of this Earth, the creation of human beings
and everything was done harmoniously by the

60
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:09,390
Will of God.
If Will of God has done everything, the human

61
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:14,961
beings should not take any credit for discovering
some things which were created by God. Supposing

62
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:20,320
this carpet is made by somebody and we start
discovering all the colours, what is so great?

63
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:27,200
It is all there. You cannot create.
So it is not the creation part of it [which

64
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,320
is] so much important but the fashioning of
this world, whole thing was done by the Will

65
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:45,070
of God. Now if the Will of God is so important,
it has to be proved. And now through Sahaja

66
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:52,760
Yoga, after the breaking of the Sahastrara,
you have now, for the first time, felt the

67
00:09:52,760 --> 00:10:00,240
Will of God, which is such an important thing,
but for us it is come to us so Sahaj that

68
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:08,850
we don’t understand. We just give the bandhan
and the things work out and we feel that the

69
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:20,100
things have worked out, so it is bandhan which
has worked out, and we have managed everything.

70
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:27,940
It’s not so. It’s much more than that.
We have now become part and parcel of that

71
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:39,240
Big Computer of that Will of God. We have
become the medium, or we can say the channels,

72
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:49,320
of that Will of God. We are connected with
that Will of God which created all this Universe.

73
00:10:49,320 --> 00:11:00,000
So everything we can manage because we have
got the Absolute Science in our hand. TheAbsolute

74
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,340
Science which will work out the betterment
of the whole world. We can prove it to the

75
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:16,630
scientist that there is a Will of God which
has done all this creation. Even evolutionary

76
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:25,260
process is the Will of God. Without His Will
nothing could have happened.

77
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:32,310
So many people used to say that – not even
a blade of grass moves without the Will of

78
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:39,930
God. Which is a very true thing. And you have
seen now that – the Will of God we have

79
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:50,940
got as our own power. We can use it. So how
important it is to be a sahaja yogi. Perhaps

80
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,260
we don’t realise how important it is to
be a sahaja yogi.

81
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:03,450
Sahaja Yoga is not only for saying “Mother,
I am full of joy, I am enjoying myself. I

82
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:10,530
got purified. Everything is fine“. But for
what? Why did you get all these blessings?

83
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:16,370
Why you have been cleansed? So that this knowledge
of the Will of God should be apparent in you.

84
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:20,260
Not only that – should be a part and parcel
of you.

85
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:26,630
So we have to raise our level, we have to
come up. For mediocre and ordinary people

86
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:32,120
it is really useless to give them Sahaja Yoga
because they are good for nothing. They are

87
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:39,600
not going to help us in any way because what
is needed is now, today that, we should have

88
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:46,240
people who can really manifest and reflect
the Will of God. And for that, you can understand,

89
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,440
we have to have very strong people because
this Will has created the whole Universe,

90
00:12:52,440 --> 00:13:01,940
the Cosmos, this Mother Earth. Everything
is created by this Will of God.

91
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:12,530
So now we are exposed to a new dimension and
that dimension is that we are the ones who

92
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:24,320
are channels of that Will of God. So then
what is our duty and what should we do about

93
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,910
it?
As a result of Sahastrara being opened out,

94
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:39,550
one thing: the illusions have vanished. What
you call [in] Sanskrit is bhranti. Illusions

95
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:54,930
have vanished. You should have no illusion
as to the existence of God Almighty, the power

96
00:13:54,930 --> 00:14:07,510
of his Will and the truth about Sahaja Yoga.
You should have no doubts at all, minimum

97
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:15,060
of minimum should be like that. But while
using this Power you should be aware that

98
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:26,620
this Power is given to you because you are
capable of handling it.

99
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:33,990
This is the Highest Power you could think
of. Take any governor, take any minister,

100
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:43,500
anyone, they can be removed tomorrow. They
can become corrupt. They can become absolutely

101
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:50,810
devoid of any knowledge of their own powers.
There are many people who just get elected

102
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:55,800
without knowing what they have to do.
So this is not just a conversion of people,

103
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:04,280
it’s not only even transformation, but it
is a new fashioning of a new human being which

104
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:14,320
has come forward and which is capable of carrying
the Will of God further.

105
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:34,860
So as a result of your Realisation, what you
have got? The first thing that has happened

106
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:43,350
is that your illusions have gone. You should
have no illusions about God Almighty, His

107
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:58,029
Will and that He is omnipotent, omnipresent
and omniscient. All His omnipotence has done

108
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:06,610
this work, and as a collective consciousness
you should also know that you are also omnipotent,

109
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:13,850
omnipresent and omniscient.
Omniscient is the thing, that He sees everything,

110
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:24,210
knows everything. Part of it, that Power,
is also within you. So to prove His omnipresence

111
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:33,000
you have to all the time be aware that you
are sahaja yogis. When I find, even now, sahaja

112
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,160
yogis struggling about their wives, their
children, their house, their jobs, I start

113
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:45,529
wondering what is their level now? Where are
they? When are they going to take up the role

114
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:55,720
of what they have got?
So the Omnipotent God who is everywhere, who

115
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:04,220
has done all this, the Will of God that has
worked it out, has to work through you people

116
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:13,300
and you have to be very strong, very sensible,
very wise, also very effective people.

117
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:20,800
The more effective you become the more energy
you will get. But still I feel that the sahaja

118
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:28,550
yogis are more, not taking the responsibility
of understanding that they have to represent

119
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:40,920
this God Almighty who is omnipresent, omniscient,
who knows everything, who sees everything

120
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:51,970
and who is potent, means Almighty.
If you understand that this is what has happened

121
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:58,850
after opening the Sahastrara, that you have
now got the power which has these three qualities

122
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:09,270
in it. Say now this big thing has to be supported
by a strong pillars, but supposing if they

123
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:14,820
are not strong, it will fall down. In the
same way such a Great Power which has come

124
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:20,390
to you. For that we don’t need very successful
people, we don’t need people who have a

125
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:25,791
big name or those who have lots of money,
what we need [is] people of character, people

126
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:33,020
of understanding, of wisdom and of strength,
that “Whatever may come I will stand by

127
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:53,420
it, I will take to it, I’ll cope with it,
I’ll change myself and improve myself“.

128
00:18:53,420 --> 00:19:01,650
So now illusion has been dispelled. I hope
you all have got rid of your illusions. Also

129
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:07,980
you should have no illusions about yourself.
If you have any illusions you should leave

130
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:15,180
Sahaja Yoga. But know that you are chosen
for this purpose by God’s Will, that’s

131
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:21,809
why you are here and you have to take it up,
the responsibility of understanding of this

132
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:31,610
science which is absolute. And working it
out yourself, for yourself as well as for

133
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:37,060
others.
You have felt My love, but your love must

134
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:45,180
also be felt, because God is love. So your
love must be felt by others. Other must feel

135
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:53,930
that you are compassionate, loving, understanding.
That’s all the time this Will of God is

136
00:19:53,930 --> 00:20:00,220
flowing through you. And you have to work
it out in such a manner that people should

137
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:06,820
know that you are a saint, that this power
is flowing through you.

138
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:13,250
Then the second thing that has happened to
you is that, not the illusion about God and

139
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:20,630
about yourself, second thing that has happened
– that you have understood the integration,

140
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:25,920
that in the world there is complete integration
which is existing.

141
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:36,960
Normally if you see the children, they have
their own natural, innate understanding. They

142
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,790
know. If you see, normally, a good child would
always like to share his things, would like

143
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:49,040
to love another child, if there’s another
little child is there, would like to protect

144
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:57,260
that child – naturally! It won’t think
whether it has black hair or red hair or blue

145
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:04,840
hair. Naturally, innately a child feels that
way.

146
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:15,940
Also if you take another child, supposing,
who is a little baby, they know that one should

147
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:22,510
be careful about the privacy of the body.
Children don’t want to be made nude before

148
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:31,320
others. No child likes it. Innately they know.
So all these innate qualities are within you.

149
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,570
Children don’t like to steal anything. They
don’t know what is stealing is. They have

150
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:42,400
no idea of stealing. I’ve also seen also
children that, if they go to a place which

151
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:50,490
is very beautiful, in somebody’s house,
they will always try to keep the beauty of

152
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:57,660
that place. But if it is already shabby they
don’t mind.

153
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:02,610
So innately all these qualities are there.
I think the countries which are supposed to

154
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:10,500
be underdeveloped have so many of these qualities
within them, which are innately built within

155
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:18,400
us. Innocence is innately built. So the Will
of God built up, first and foremost thing,

156
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:25,720
was innocence, the auspiciousness. The first
thing He did was to create Shri Ganesha, or

157
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:32,400
I would say, She, because the Will of God
is Adi Shakti. And all this was created first

158
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:40,610
of all to make the whole world very beautiful.
All these innate qualities were also placed

159
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:49,090
within you. All those Deities were placed
within you. [They] were specially made, human

160
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:57,460
beings, that they should become saintly people,
that they should have their saintly, innate

161
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,340
sense.
But it happened in the countries which developed,

162
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:08,700
that our brain was bombarded by all kinds
of television, all kind of things, and we

163
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:22,060
became very, we can say, we became very vulnerable.
We started getting into the ideas of others.

164
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:28,200
Anybody who is dominating could dominate us.
It’s not only Hitler who dominated people.

165
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:35,800
We also see today how much we are dominated,
if you really detach yourself from this world.

166
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:43,660
For example fashions. Certain things that
come up, people cannot give up at any cost.

167
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,680
They cannot take to something that is sensible
because it’s a fashion.

168
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:55,800
For example nowadays there’s a fashion,
say to have such a small skirt. You can’t

169
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:02,860
get a long skirt anywhere. Everybody has to
wear that kind of a skirt otherwise you are

170
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:12,070
not ‘in’, you are not in the madhouse!
Now this kind of thing is bombarded on us

171
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:19,551
morning till evening so, first of all, we
become slaves of these entrepreneurs. Whatever

172
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:23,800
they give us now, I was told that in Belgium
you cannot get anything fresh. You have to

173
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,900
take everything from the supermarket, which
is all tinned.

174
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:35,880
Gradually what is happening to us – we are
getting absolutely artificial. The food is

175
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:42,360
artificial, the dress is artificial, our whole
attitude becomes artificial because we are

176
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:49,500
so much bombarded by advertisement, by all
kinds of outside influences that we just get

177
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:56,850
lost and we forget what is our innate sense
which is being dominated by all these modern

178
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:03,280
things.
So adding up to the science also there is

179
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:12,910
a a big progress in another direction, that
we can call, the money became very important.

180
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:19,830
Once money becomes important, then all your
entrepreneurs become important, because they

181
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,050
know how to make money and befool you all
the time. Today you have this thing, tomorrow

182
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:28,820
you have that thing. Today you change this
and have this thing.

183
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:35,000
But those people who are innately built, they
do not change! They have their dresses of

184
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,970
the same type, they do not change. On the
contrary they find it very difficult to get

185
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:47,620
out of their traditional achievements and
they don’t want to change themselves. So

186
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:53,929
for sahaja yogis it is important to see and
watch if they are getting this slavery from

187
00:25:53,929 --> 00:26:02,750
the entrepreneurs in modern times.
Then, the thoughts. So many books we read,

188
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:11,620
which gives you thoughts, which are some mad
rambling, I would say, of some madman, like

189
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:21,060
Freud. How could Freud influence the West?
Because you have lost your innate sense and

190
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:32,170
you accepted. You accepted that and that’s
how Freud became your, sort of a, Jesus Christ.

191
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:37,890
He became the most important thing. Sex became
the most important thing. I mean it’s so

192
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:57,910
simple. With little common sense you can understand
that, at every moment, we are put into this

193
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:09,290
kind of a domination by these few domineering
people who have certain ideas, and they put

194
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:13,200
[these ideas] forward.
Anybody puts any idea. For example, Sade (the

195
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,300
Marquis de Sade) or Sartre or anyone. That
idea starts becoming “Oh he said it“.

196
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:24,340
Who is he? What is his life? Just see for
yourself what sort of a man he is. With little

197
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:29,890
common sense. But with your will that you
have now, Will of God, which has fashioned

198
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:33,140
the whole world, which has fashioned you.

199
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:39,150
Every cell within you has been fashioned by
God Almighty and what you are doing is to

200
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:47,250
play into the hands of these entrepreneurs.
They have realised that these vulnerable people

201
00:27:47,250 --> 00:28:01,100
are very good for having as their disciples,
I should say, to make money, to befool them.

202
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:10,520
Now on this side, you have such a Great Power,
you are chosen for a, such a great thing,

203
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:19,880
and on the other side you have this kind of
slavery.

204
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:27,070
So try to understand that your innate qualities
were lost. But luckily, by the Kundalini awakening

205
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:35,679
and by the breaking of the Sahastrara, all
these innate qualities which looked like lost:

206
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:44,250
like your innocence, like your creativity,
like your religion within, like your compassion

207
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:57,570
and love for the humanity, like your power
of judgment, wisdom. All these great qualities

208
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:05,260
which we thought were lost were nothing but
they were in a dormant state. They all got

209
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:09,620
awakened one by one.
I don’t have to tell you “Don’t drink

210
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:18,070
this! Don’t eat this! Don’t do that!”.
You yourself realise that this is wrong. You

211
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:25,220
yourself know what is good for you. And still
if you want to do wrong you can go ahead.

212
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:30,929
But already there is a light within you to
see for yourself what is good and what is

213
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:37,080
bad. It has come because of this Sahastrara
being opened out to this – a new dimension

214
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,820
of new knowledge. And this is not new, it
is all innately built within you. Now all

215
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:50,600
those innate qualities are manifesting and
you are enjoying them.

216
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,780
So now you have to get out of your petty ideas
and petty things. People are reporting to

217
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,830
Me something very funny – I can’t believe
sahaja yogis can do like that – that they

218
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:05,791
run away with the plates that I have bought,
or they run away with the cups, they throw

219
00:30:05,791 --> 00:30:10,980
things here and there, all over the places
they are throwing things. How can you behave

220
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:19,460
like this? I mean this is so stupid and so
insipid. If you do not have a proper discipline

221
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:26,340
of life yourself, you cannot carry the Will
of God, you cannot. But I’m not going to

222
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:36,730
tell you “Do this or do that!” I respect
your freedom and I just want that your own

223
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:43,210
Kundalini should awaken that wisdom in you,
that greatness in you, that glory in you and

224
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:47,280
you start understanding what is our innate
quality.

225
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:54,390
So it will purify you. Once you are purified
completely, like you see, if you have some

226
00:30:54,390 --> 00:31:02,500
gold which is not pure you put it in the fire,
the gold is separated. In the same way, the

227
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:09,880
fire of Kundalini cleanses you completely,
makes you absolutely clean, and you start

228
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:18,400
seeing your own glory, your own nature, your
own greatness. So the integration part comes

229
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:29,710
to you easily. You start integrating.
First of all, we used to have sahaja yogis,

230
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:36,980
say from, some from England, some from Spain,
some from here. They would always have different

231
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:41,640
groups, they would never sit together. You
could make out this is English sitting here,

232
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:47,190
they are sitting here, they are sitting here,
and they would form a group. But now it’s

233
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:59,590
not so. Now I find they all are becoming integrated.
The integration of human beings is the most

234
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:08,809
important thing for Sahaja Yoga. That comes
by understanding, not by your intelligence,

235
00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:17,080
but by innate understanding that – all human
beings are made by God, by His will, and we

236
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:23,820
have no right to despise anyone.
The second integration that has come within

237
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:37,310
you is that all religions, all religions,
are born on the same tree of spiritual life.

238
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:48,840
That all religions are to be worshipped, all
incarnations, all prophets, all scriptures

239
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:55,770
are to be worshipped. There are defects, there
are problems with those scriptures which can

240
00:32:55,770 --> 00:33:00,420
be corrected.
So gradually you start entering into the subtler

241
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:08,080
side of Divinity, to understand that all these
people have worked hard to create, today,

242
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:14,590
the atmosphere for Sahaja Yoga, and no religion
is to be despised, and no religion is to be

243
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:26,850
attacked, which is a very, very, absolutely
a unreal thing and you are working out a very

244
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:32,990
unreal theory which doesn’t exist in the
Divine plan.

245
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:39,350
So this is how we finish all fundamentalism.
Fundamentalists are the ones who believed

246
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:44,610
that this is written in this book, this is
written in this book, and that we, because

247
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:51,220
we read this book, we are something better.
Anybody can read any book, what is so great?

248
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:57,460
Same, I would say, in Sahaja Yoga people should
not become fundamentalist. Be very careful!

249
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:01,590
Because that’s what you are – born like
that, I mean, I don’t know, it’s not your

250
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:06,919
innate quality but the way you are made that
way, you have fashioned yourself that way,

251
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:13,470
that you start also making Sahaja Yoga sometimes
a fundamental. “Mother said so.”

252
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:21,620
Do not use Me anywhere! “Mother said so!”
Is a way you want to dominate others. You

253
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:27,040
yourself say because now you have a right,
you have an individuality in Sahaja Yoga.

254
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:33,429
You can say what you have to say yourself,
but don’t say that “Mother has said it!”

255
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:41,590
Because anybody can start it, like that: “Christ
said it!”. A clergyman or, a say, pope can

256
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:51,800
stand up on his own platform and say that
Christ has said it. They can just arbitrarily

257
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,500
use all these things.

258
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:59,950
So nobody has business to use Me arbitrarily.
Whatever you have to say you say yourself.

259
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:05,220
But don’t ever quote Me as that: “Mother
has said it,” or, “In this book such and

260
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:10,670
such is written, so this is the line, that
is important.” You are not bound by any

261
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:16,731
line, by whatever I say. It is you who has
to stand up and see for yourself what you

262
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:25,420
have to say, because you have to use now your
will and for that you have to develop yourself

263
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:32,320
to have Pure Will, the Pure Desire of God
Almighty.

264
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:40,691
The integration not only outward, but inward.
Like first of all, whatever we did, our mind

265
00:35:40,691 --> 00:35:47,480
used to say one thing, our heart used to say
another thing, our brain used to say another

266
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:56,800
thing. Now what has happened that all these
3 things have become one. So, whatever your

267
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:04,950
brain says is absolutely acceptable to your
heart, absolutely acceptable to your attention.

268
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:10,480
So you yourself, you have become now integrated.
Many people write “Mother I want to do it,

269
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,630
but I can’t do it,” “Mother it was my
desire to do it, but I can’t do it.” Not

270
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:23,760
now. Now you are completely integrated and
you can easily do the whole thing very well.

271
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:32,330
If you want to examine yourself, you should
try to find out “Am I integrated or not?

272
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:37,800
Whatever I’m doing, am I doing with my full
heart or not, with my full attention or not?”

273
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:45,180
I’ve seen that you do with full heart and
full intelligence but full attention is not

274
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:51,599
there. Still the attention, which is the first
thing that was enlightened, is not fully used.

275
00:36:51,599 --> 00:37:03,510
So the whole attention should be absolutely
there, that, “I have to do this thing with

276
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:10,080
full attention.” Otherwise, the integration
is not complete, integration is partial. So

277
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:26,460
these three things have to be completely integrated.
So the integration of all the chakras comes

278
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:37,370
in. Like whatever you do, has to be auspicious.
Whatever you do has to be with full attention.

279
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:47,040
Whatever you do has to be absolutely religious.
So like that, all these centres are being

280
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:55,430
absolutely, one integrated power that you
have. So the whole life should be integrated.

281
00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:00,620
Now, say somebody’s husband is not that
level or somebody’s wife is not of that

282
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:06,790
level, you shouldn’t bother. You should
just bother about yourself. Don’t expect

283
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:13,770
anything from anybody else. It is your duty
which is important. You have to fulfill your

284
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:23,790
duty and you have to work it out yourself.
Unless and until you understand that it is

285
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:27,109
your individual being which has achieved it,
and it’s the individual being which has

286
00:38:27,109 --> 00:38:32,500
to realise it, is the individual being that
has to become one, integrated with the rest

287
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:37,070
of them.
If you start putting things, like many a times

288
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:42,140
I’ve seen [that] if I say something people
start thinking that I am saying for somebody

289
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:50,330
else, they never take it for themselves. So,
not we have to see what is my gain: “I’ve

290
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:56,369
got financial gain,” say, “I’ve got
physical gains, I’ve got mental gains, I’ve

291
00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:06,400
got joy, happiness,” that’s not the only
thing. That should not be the only criteria.

292
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:16,619
But what you should have is the understanding
of your own personality which is being specially

293
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:26,390
fashioned [through] many, many lives for you
to come in this life to get your Realisation,

294
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:38,370
to do the further work of Will of God.
Every moment when you see a miracle taking

295
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:44,400
place, you do realise that it’s all done
by Paramchaitanya. But what is Paramchaitanya

296
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:52,631
– is the will of Adi Shakti. And what is
Adi Shakti – is the Will of God. So, is

297
00:39:52,631 --> 00:40:02,300
all, whatever is done, is all ‘fixed entities’,
we can call them, or these vibrations are

298
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:13,620
like, we can say, DNA tapes. They all know
how they have to fashion you.

299
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:21,349
See, today it’s very sunny. Everybody is
surprised how can they have. So many things

300
00:40:21,349 --> 00:40:26,910
happen like this. The other day, we had havan,
it was absolutely sunny. So the whole Cosmos

301
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:33,460
is working for you. You are on the stage now
and you have to see to it, but if you don’t

302
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:44,450
have faith in yourself, if you are not confident
as to what you are, how can you help? How

303
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:52,240
can you work out yourself and work out all
the problems of the world, which are created

304
00:40:52,240 --> 00:41:00,080
only by human beings?
So we have to absolutely overthrow all these

305
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:06,430
dominations on us. First from science. We
can prove everything that Sahaja Yoga, whatever

306
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:14,380
it has said about science, has been proved.
So, we can throw science which is just always,

307
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:18,330
all the time, in the flux, it’s changing
all the time.

308
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:24,730
Then the so-called religions that we have.
So-called religions because people who have

309
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:30,030
been Catholics, who have been Protestants,
who have been Hindus or Muslims, or this and

310
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:37,450
that, they all have got that thing on their
heads. And this has to be thrown away. We

311
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:44,180
have to become a new personality. After Realisation,
as I said, you become like a lotuses is from

312
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:49,510
the mud.
So now you have become lotuses and the lotuses

313
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:56,870
have to throw away all this dead mud, otherwise
fragrance won’t be there. That, one has

314
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:10,940
to achieve: is to throw away all these shackles
which are, which are killing you, which are

315
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:22,810
of no use, but a burden. And beautiful lotuses
as you are you have to understand that the

316
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:34,740
whole fashioning has been done so carefully,
with such sweetness, with such delicacy.

317
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:43,970
So first of all we must have respect for ourselves,
we must have affection and love for others

318
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:53,320
and we must have respect, means we must have
discipline. We have to have the discipline

319
00:42:53,320 --> 00:43:00,890
because if you respect yourself you’ll definitely
discipline yourself and you’ll make it available.

320
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:10,580
Now as you can realise, that from My life
itself, that I work very hard, travel a lot,

321
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:20,700
much more than any one of you can do. Because
I have the will that – I have to bring this

322
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:30,010
world to that state of enjoyment, to that
state of happiness, to that state of Divinity,

323
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:38,369
where they realise what is their glory, what
is the glory of their Father.

324
00:43:38,369 --> 00:43:45,020
So I work very hard and I never even think
that something will go wrong with Me, or “This

325
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:50,160
will happen”, “What will happen?” I
never have bothered you about My family life,

326
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,220
about My children, about anyone. Whatever
problems I had, I am dealing with them Myself.

327
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:01,410
But here I get such big, big letters from
sahaja yogis, writing about their daughter,

328
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:08,010
their son, this thing, that thing.
Another thing is attachment to family is the

329
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:12,540
biggest burden on your heads and all the time
you are worried about your children, you are

330
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:13,540
worried about this, you are worried about
that. That’s not your responsibility. Please

331
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:20,010
try to understand. That’s the responsibility
of God Almighty. You can’t do better than

332
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:28,480
Him can you? But when you try to take the
responsibility He says “All right, look

333
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:32,859
after!” and the problems start.
‘Detachment’ is the word one should understand

334
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:38,230
in a proper sense. When I ask people why do
you throw things here and there, say “We

335
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:41,490
are detached!”- wonderful way! And what
about your children? You cling on to them.

336
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:44,300
What about your own things? You cling on to
them. For a small little thing, they’ll

337
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:48,670
bother My head. And, when it belongs to Me
or to Sahaja Yoga, then they’ll have a very

338
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:57,660
nice time with it – and throw it away, wherever
they feel like. I mean this kind of irresponsibility!

339
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:05,070
How can you call them divine? How can they
be saintly people? Saintly people not only

340
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:12,540
are responsible for themselves, but for everyone.
Very slowly, smoothly, sweetly, with great

341
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:19,839
affection, I have brought you to this level.
I didn’t ask you to go to Himalayas or stand

342
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,785
on your heads or to donate all your properties
to Me. Nothing of the kind. We have managed

343
00:45:23,785 --> 00:45:27,880
it in a very, very beautiful manner. Now further,
when you have to go further, then you have

344
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:35,810
to understand that your duties are to be fulfilled
by you and by nobody else. But these duties

345
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:42,230
are done by you, are towards your family,
towards your house, towards this, towards

346
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:49,089
that. No duties towards Sahaja Yoga.
So when you were, before Sahaja Yoga, you

347
00:45:49,089 --> 00:45:58,370
were not attached to anyone, in the sense
– you were only attached to yourself, self-centered.

348
00:45:58,370 --> 00:46:04,490
Now you have widened yourself a little more,
that now you are attached to your wife, to

349
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:09,280
your children. But that’s just the same.
That is also selfish, because they are your

350
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:17,560
children, you think. They are not your children,
they are the children of God.

351
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,701
I hope all of you are intelligent enough to
understand your responsibility and work it

352
00:46:19,701 --> 00:46:20,701
out.
This is a very important thing that has happened

353
00:46:20,701 --> 00:46:21,701
to you that Sahastrara has opened. Now you
can prove the existence of God, His Will,

354
00:46:21,701 --> 00:46:22,701
everything, to the whole world. Nobody can
challenge Sahaja Yoga. Those scientist who

355
00:46:22,701 --> 00:46:23,701
will challenge can be told. Anybody, whether
you’re a scientist, economist, politician,

356
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:24,701
anything, everything can be explained in the
light of Sahaja Yoga and can be proved that

357
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:25,701
there’s only one politics – that is of
God, one economics – that is of God, and

358
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:26,701
there is only one religion – that is of
God, is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. It can be proved,

359
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:27,701
there’s nothing to be afraid of or to worry
about.

360
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:28,701
This all can be proved to the scientist and
to the other intellectuals and to some few

361
00:46:28,701 --> 00:46:29,701
people if they want to listen to us. If they
don’t want to listen to us, forget it. Because

362
00:46:29,701 --> 00:46:30,701
we are so powerful, why should you worry about
them? But, if they are willing to listen to

363
00:46:30,701 --> 00:46:31,701
us, then is better that we tell them “Now
we have discovered this Great Power”, and

364
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:32,701
if it works out, if this Great Power works
out then only we can really fashion the whole

365
00:46:32,701 --> 00:46:33,701
world in a new way.
I have great hopes from you people, but the

366
00:46:33,701 --> 00:46:34,701
seriousness with which you should take Sahaja
Yoga, for example even meditation, people

367
00:46:34,701 --> 00:46:35,701
don’t do. Simple thing like meditation,
you people don’t do, I can’t understand.

368
00:46:35,701 --> 00:46:36,701
How will you grow without meditation?
Unless and until you become thoughtlessly

369
00:46:36,701 --> 00:46:37,701
aware you cannot grow. So you have to, you
have to at least meditate morning, evening.

370
00:46:37,701 --> 00:46:38,701
There are many people who are not even collective
by temperament. If they are staying in an

371
00:46:38,701 --> 00:46:39,701
ashram they just think that ashram life is
no good. Such people should really get out

372
00:46:39,701 --> 00:46:40,701
of Sahaja Yoga, because they have not yet
understood what this Sahaja Yoga is. Without

373
00:46:40,701 --> 00:46:41,701
collectivity how will you grow? How will you
assemble your power? You see? You know very

374
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:42,701
well that in a sangha, in a group, in combining
together only, you can be strong. Is a fact

375
00:46:42,701 --> 00:46:43,701
that if you have one stick you can break it,
but if you put many sticks together you cannot

376
00:46:43,701 --> 00:46:44,701
break it.
But there are still people I know who are

377
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:45,701
still not so much in collectivity. Shows how
poor they are in their understanding of their

378
00:46:45,701 --> 00:46:46,701
own Self, and they are telling Me that “Mother,
we don’t want to stay in the Ashram now

379
00:46:46,701 --> 00:46:47,701
anywhere more.” So they should get out of
Sahaja Yoga.

380
00:46:47,701 --> 00:46:48,701
Without the collectivity, you cannot grow.
Without the discipline of Sahaja Yoga, you

381
00:46:48,701 --> 00:46:49,701
cannot grow. It’s better to have ten people
of good quality than to have thousand useless

382
00:46:49,701 --> 00:46:50,701
people. That’s what is the Will of God.
So now, as you are today here, so many people,

383
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:54,359
I am really enamoured to see so many people
are there. And we have done so much of our

384
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:59,680
growth and grown out of all those nonsensical
things that we were following.

385
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:08,760
But today we have to take a vow that – “I’ll
now fashion my life according to the Will

386
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:18,580
of God. Absolutely. And dedicate myself to
that.” No family, no other considerations.

387
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:25,800
Just forget it! Nothing so important. Everything
can be looked after by Will of God. So if

388
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:31,990
you just try to follow the Will of God, your
children will be looked after, everything

389
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:38,900
will be looked after, you don’t have to
worry for anything. And that works. Just try

390
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:43,640
to understand that you have problems because
you don’t want to give those problems to

391
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,970
God, you want to keep it to themselves, that’s
why you have problems. If you decide that

392
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:56,450
“No, I just want to give these problems
to the God’s will,” Finished!

393
00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:02,130
Also there are some who want to say that “We
are not so capable Mother, we can’t do it.”

394
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:13,310
Saying like this also is stupid. You test
yourself, you see for yourself. So first of

395
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:20,609
all, one has to understand why do we say such
a thing? Maybe that we are very money-oriented,

396
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:25,820
that we want to have money to ourselves, or
something like that. Or some people are there

397
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:32,940
who talk of business also in Sahaja Yoga.
There must be something like a money orientation,

398
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:38,410
or some sort of a material attachment that
they say that ‘We are not capable, we cannot

399
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:43,230
change.”
The second could be this mamatwa as they call

400
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:50,930
it. The attachment to your family, children,
this, that. Or, ‘This is mine, this is mine,

401
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:57,130
this is mine.” This could be the second
reason that you think that you are not bold

402
00:48:57,130 --> 00:49:02,990
enough or you are not strong enough to do
Sahaja Yoga.

403
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:11,460
Thirdly could be that you are still playing
with your old habits and that you are enjoying

404
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:19,310
your life without virtues. There can be some
reason like that. So just try to locate, “Why

405
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:31,560
am I behaving like this? Why am I not getting
into the same beautiful path of my ascent

406
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:37,510
as everybody has got it.” If we introspect,
you’ll find out that “There’s something

407
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:45,410
wrong with me that I think I am not capable
of doing.” You are capable of doing everything!

408
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:53,410
You just try this and enjoy it.
So, most important thing now [that] remains

409
00:49:53,410 --> 00:50:05,920
is that you should become a proper, strong,
compassionate vehicle of God’s Will. So.

410
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,590
Then, what is most important of course, I
agree, that you do My puja, because that helps

411
00:50:11,590 --> 00:50:20,400
you a lot, no doubt. But other things are
not important. So many other things you people

412
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:29,880
tell Me is not of importance. Main thing is
that you should all ascend higher and higher

413
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,330
and compete with each other in getting into
higher situation.

414
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:43,030
As it is, I think in such a short time we
have achieved a lot, no doubt, but still we

415
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:50,470
have to speed up and work it out. I am sure
that this new science, or we can say, the,

416
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:57,740
which is the absolute science will one day
outshadow the other science, and tell people

417
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:03,320
that: this is what it is. It is in your hands,
you work it out.

418
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:14,599
So today is the day we are celebrate by which
we have opened absolutely a new dimension,

419
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:26,630
absolutely a venue of great Divinity, of the
proofs of Divine. And this is something so

420
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:39,710
great that we can really finish all the illusions
they have about themselves, about their ego.

421
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:47,310
We can manage them. That power you all have.
May God Bless You.
