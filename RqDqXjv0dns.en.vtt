00:00:08.343 --> 00:00:13.927
So, now we are today going to tell you about collectivity.

00:00:14.007 --> 00:00:21.838
You must hear the first part of this – is very
interesting -but I am doing the second part now.

00:00:21.918 --> 00:00:28.918
Now, collectivity is a thing, is to be understood in
a much deeper way than we have thought, you see.

00:00:28.998 --> 00:00:36.067
First of all, in collectivity, when we
say this body is a collective instrument

00:00:36.147 --> 00:00:38.445
made out of many cells, all right?

00:00:38.525 --> 00:00:42.336
Then what do we
understand? That first thing is, in

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:46.746
collectivity we must realize
that there is interdependence.

00:00:46.826 --> 00:00:48.514
We have to depend on others.

00:00:48.594 --> 00:00:54.819
Like he has to depend on her
and she is dependent upon him.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.484
But when it comes to ego not only
that it separates you from each other

00:01:00.564 --> 00:01:08.316
– that’s not the only thing it does – but it
teaches you not to be dependent on anyone.

00:01:08.396 --> 00:01:10.739
You have to depend on others.

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:15.317
You are not to exploit others
but you have to depend on others

00:01:15.397 --> 00:01:20.655
and others have to depend upon you first thing very much.

00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:23.565
On this subject I’ll tell you a little more.

00:01:24.348 --> 00:01:30.830
So, you first of all ascertain yourself
how far you are, without feeling bad about it,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.636
because collectivity is the place where you belong to.

00:01:35.716 --> 00:01:39.910
You do not really belong to
this individual being that you are.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.280
You belong to collectivity and that’s
why you have to be there, and to be there,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.496
you have to face your, all the time yourself and
find out how far you are away from that collectivity,

00:01:52.576 --> 00:01:57.200
how far you are deciding things for
yourself and not for the collectivity.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.227
You have to be very much on the alert and
this is the discipline you have to pick out yourself.

00:02:03.307 --> 00:02:10.565
if I tell you you have to be alert all the time,
within yourself to see that are you in collectivity,

00:02:10.645 --> 00:02:16.170
are you doing something in collectivity,
or you are doing something for yourself?

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.018
Do not deceive yourself at this point

00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:22.737
because deceiving yourself means
you are deceiving your collectivity.

00:02:22.817 --> 00:02:30.490
Your chances of being there which
is beyond, which you have achieved.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.639
So try to do something which is
congenial, helpful to collectivity.

00:02:38.298 --> 00:02:47.776
The moment you start becoming unaware of your
collectivity, immediately cancer starts going in My body.

00:02:47.856 --> 00:02:53.239
I get physical troubles because of that.

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.267
So the collectivity is not what you
think of yourself, to be something great.

00:02:59.347 --> 00:03:03.529
It’s not that you are above everything
and you are this and you are that.

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:11.051
How much you have done to enhance
the collectivity of understanding, of love.

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:16.667
Just thinking about yourself, then
you are not thinking of collectivity.

00:03:18.473 --> 00:03:23.256
But a person who is collective
is the most interesting person.

00:03:25.696 --> 00:03:32.623
The one who is not that way, he may think
himself to be something great, so let him think,

00:03:32.703 --> 00:03:37.539
but he’s not interesting, extremely boring
and people run away from such a person.

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:41.776
The reason is he’s not collective. He’s not auspicious.

00:03:43.362 --> 00:03:48.537
So, to become collective you have
to watch yourself like a [unclear].

00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:55.299
Now I would say for that, collective
meditation is very important,

00:04:00.254 --> 00:04:03.067
So once you start getting out of the collectivity

00:04:03.147 --> 00:04:11.254
it is the Mahakali Herself, picks
you out and starts throwing you out,

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:15.287
slowly slowly to the subconscious area

00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:18.933
and where you just disappear.

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:22.900
And all kinds of problems start,

00:04:24.267 --> 00:04:27.520
I have seen this happening in every country,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.220
that people who do not attend the collective meditation.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.920
For France I have the same report

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.634
and I think the people who do not grow will be thrown out.

00:04:44.714 --> 00:04:47.754
So once you are thrown out into the left side

00:04:47.834 --> 00:04:50.054
then you can imagine, you can develop any kind

00:04:50.134 --> 00:04:52.154
of left-side diseases to begin with,

00:04:52.234 --> 00:04:55.307
Mooladhara diseases are the worst,

00:04:55.387 --> 00:04:59.410
So at any cost that must be avoided.

00:05:01.153 --> 00:05:05.307
But if you are not in the collective, if
you do not understand the collective,

00:05:05.387 --> 00:05:08.773
and if you are out of the collective

00:05:08.853 --> 00:05:13.307
you'll be surprised that
negative forces will join together

00:05:13.387 --> 00:05:16.240
and they'll pull you out.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.620
So this is one of the things that happens,

00:05:21.153 --> 00:05:27.986
so be very careful that don't
avoid the collective programmes.

00:05:28.066 --> 00:05:31.149
In the collectivity supposing you have one problem,

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.062
another one has some problem. It just works out, balances.

00:05:39.263 --> 00:05:45.249
As one finger is cut out, it is useless

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:52.583
or a nail which is taken out is useless. It dies.

00:05:52.663 --> 00:05:56.049
So that is how we are organizing

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:59.953
our spiritual death and ultimately I don't know what else.

00:06:00.033 --> 00:06:03.567
I am thinking of the collectivity of the whole world,

00:06:03.647 --> 00:06:09.087
that's my vision, and if Sahaja Yogis cannot be collective

00:06:09.167 --> 00:06:13.053
who is going to be collective?

00:06:13.133 --> 00:06:16.633
Who is going to fulfill my vision?

00:06:21.403 --> 00:06:25.790
So all of you, those who call themselves Sahaja Yogis,

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.958
must attend the programme.

00:06:28.038 --> 00:06:35.090
So this collectivity comes only by understanding one thing

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.257
what a great work we are doing today,

00:06:38.337 --> 00:06:41.758
people are not conscious of
that, they take it just by the way.

00:06:45.508 --> 00:06:54.328
You have to understand that how
a collective phenomenon works out.

00:06:54.408 --> 00:07:00.008
If there is a realized soul

00:07:03.504 --> 00:07:16.961
then he is surrounded by at
least 2 or 3 divine beings, at least.

00:07:17.041 --> 00:07:26.761
But in certain cases when there is a
realized soul and he is not yet, say that good,

00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:31.079
say for example if he smokes, take an example.

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:34.842
And let’s say there is only one
[Divine being] following such a man.

00:07:34.922 --> 00:07:38.719
If all his chakras are bad and despite he smokes also

00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:41.083
and he also drinks and things like that,

00:07:41.163 --> 00:07:46.095
then maybe there is only one, maybe
with him or may not be even one sometimes.

00:07:46.175 --> 00:07:51.462
But mostly there’s at least
one, minimum one you can put it.

00:07:51.542 --> 00:07:57.275
So every realized soul has got some people with them.

00:07:59.342 --> 00:08:04.028
And if somebody does some sinful
act for a short time say for example,

00:08:04.108 --> 00:08:07.061
he does something bad, actually very bad,

00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:14.462
then all of them might depart for the
time being but they again come back to him.

00:08:14.542 --> 00:08:24.495
Now when such a man is
struggling to have a, an experience,

00:08:24.575 --> 00:08:31.395
if there is another positive person,
a very positive person comes in,

00:08:31.475 --> 00:08:38.761
he may be having more people with him,

00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:46.075
so he may be able to spare some
of his people to prop up this man.

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:56.861
So it acts like a, just like the valencies of the atoms.

00:08:56.941 --> 00:09:02.028
But the only difference is between the two is

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:09.961
that human beings can accumulate as much as they want,

00:09:10.041 --> 00:09:20.141
they can change, but the atoms cannot change.

00:09:24.161 --> 00:09:29.607
When the Sahaja Yogis are
collectively there, they really enjoy.

00:09:29.687 --> 00:09:34.241
Because for the first time you start
enjoying human beings, first time.

00:09:34.321 --> 00:09:36.081
Before this you never enjoyed them.

00:09:36.161 --> 00:09:39.825
You enjoyed flowers, you enjoyed
everything else, but not human beings.

00:09:39.905 --> 00:09:45.338
Pure enjoyment of human beings starts
coming when you become fully realized.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:50.505
That’s why collectivity is the only
way I can work out Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:50.585 --> 00:09:57.471
I can’t think I can work out through
the people who are separated, divided.

00:09:57.551 --> 00:10:03.938
It is said, Christ has said also that…
They said, “What have we to do?”

00:10:04.018 --> 00:10:09.385
He said, “When you love each other
you have done the greatest justice to Me”.

00:10:09.465 --> 00:10:10.561
It’s true.

00:10:15.845 --> 00:10:23.294
And the cleansing is the simplest
thing in Sahaja Yoga: is to be collective.

00:10:23.374 --> 00:10:29.792
If you are not collective then
know that something wrong with you.

00:10:29.872 --> 00:10:36.108
If you are collective then as if you
are taking your bath in the river Ganges.

00:10:36.188 --> 00:10:40.130
You don't have to go to Himalayas, you
don't have to do individual sadhana much,

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.445
you don't have to... just be
collective. If you are collective,

00:10:43.525 --> 00:10:49.853
if you are enjoying the collective,
then you should know that you are clean.

00:10:49.933 --> 00:10:54.325
No blemishes there, you are absolutely all right.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:02.930
So now, let us see how do we

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.570
miss out on collectivity.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:16.490
There's a very practical down-to-earth understanding.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:22.250
First we must know without collectivity we cannot exist.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:29.530
As the body has to be in connection with the brain,

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.130
in the same way without collectivity

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.730
Sahaja Yoga cannot exist.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:40.570
Once you understand that,

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.330
then you have to work it out that collectivity

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:49.050
is absolutely established within and without.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:55.021
It is more within that you
have to establish, than without.

00:11:55.855 --> 00:12:00.335
Whatever you have within is manifested outside.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:06.170
Now how do we establish it within ourselves?

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.010
First of all,

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:17.690
we have to understand

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:22.969
that now we are the relations of each other.

00:12:23.049 --> 00:12:30.088
So the first thing is that within ourselves

00:12:30.168 --> 00:12:34.728
we have to see introspection, with introspection,

00:12:34.808 --> 00:12:39.688
what are we doing against collectivity in our mind,

00:12:40.194 --> 00:12:42.797
how our mind is working.

00:12:42.877 --> 00:12:46.477
and we are one big family together.

00:12:49.104 --> 00:12:51.897
We are part and parcel of one body.

00:12:51.977 --> 00:12:56.286
Do not try to see the defects of another person,

00:12:56.853 --> 00:13:00.453
but goodness of another person.

00:13:04.067 --> 00:13:06.873
That is really going to help you the most.

00:13:06.953 --> 00:13:12.313
Now the worst enemy of collectivity is aggressiveness.

00:13:12.393 --> 00:13:15.033
Some people are basically aggressive;

00:13:15.113 --> 00:13:18.313
their style of talking is extremely aggressive.

00:13:18.393 --> 00:13:21.392
The way they say things is aggressive,

00:13:21.472 --> 00:13:26.114
So what you have to practice here is humility:

00:13:26.194 --> 00:13:27.906
try to be humble.

00:13:27.986 --> 00:13:33.506
Meditating together is the
best way to feel the collectivity.

00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:38.059
You can meditate at home, of course,
you also cleanse it for your depth,

00:13:38.139 --> 00:13:40.298
but also you must meditate together

00:13:40.378 --> 00:13:42.140
and when you meditate together

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.138
then the strength that you have

00:13:46.218 --> 00:13:47.778
strengthens others,

00:13:47.858 --> 00:13:52.258
and the strength of the whole
collectivity improves so much.

00:13:52.338 --> 00:13:55.858
You are meditating together is a very big thing.

00:13:55.938 --> 00:13:59.858
Everyone has to understand that whenever you get time

00:13:59.938 --> 00:14:02.258
you find out in the morning times, for example,

00:14:02.338 --> 00:14:05.058
we'll go to the ashram and meditate.

00:14:05.138 --> 00:14:08.578
Say, Sunday morning, we'll just
go and meditate in the ashram.

00:14:08.658 --> 00:14:10.538
Just for meditation you have to come.

00:14:10.618 --> 00:14:12.338
Meditate and go away

00:14:12.418 --> 00:14:15.018
because I reside in this ashram,

00:14:15.098 --> 00:14:17.658
I am here, so leave your homes,

00:14:17.738 --> 00:14:20.098
come here and meditate.

00:14:20.178 --> 00:14:22.378
Meditation will help you a lot.

00:14:22.458 --> 00:14:25.978
Wherever you are together, I am with you

00:14:26.058 --> 00:14:30.898
but when you are away from each other, I am not with you.

00:14:31.498 --> 00:14:35.298
Only in difficulties, when you are pushed into some places

00:14:35.378 --> 00:14:40.178
where I am not there, where you
think I am not there, I am there.

00:14:40.258 --> 00:14:41.738
But

00:14:41.818 --> 00:14:45.218
if you deliberately are keeping out of collectivity,

00:14:45.298 --> 00:14:46.738
I am not with you,

00:14:46.818 --> 00:14:48.778
so try to grow your collectivity

00:14:48.858 --> 00:14:54.098
otherwise you cannot go deep into your own depths,

00:14:54.178 --> 00:14:56.018
you cannot become a great Sahaja Yogi,

00:14:56.098 --> 00:15:00.378
you cannot really be called a Sahaja Yogi.

00:15:00.458 --> 00:15:04.482
Those who have a sense of
collectivity can only become that.

00:15:08.362 --> 00:15:13.376
The joy we were feeling, it was
because our Kundalini was dancing.

00:15:14.089 --> 00:15:19.381
She was so happy because what were you asking there?

00:15:21.091 --> 00:15:27.301
Nothing but the enjoyment of collectivity.

00:15:29.234 --> 00:15:34.286
Collectivity doesn't mean that we all
should be stuck together with some glue

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:39.306
or something or we all become like Gibraltar,

00:15:40.231 --> 00:15:43.808
Rock of Gibraltar. No, it doesn’t mean that.

00:15:43.888 --> 00:15:47.652
It means wherever you are, you are connected.

00:15:48.636 --> 00:15:50.551
That is collectivity.

00:15:50.631 --> 00:15:53.454
As soon as there’s a problem somewhere,

00:15:53.534 --> 00:15:58.159
into any part, any part of the world,

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:05.080
you are connected and you’re effective, you can manage.

00:16:07.203 --> 00:16:11.213
But if you are not connected
and you are just glued together,

00:16:11.293 --> 00:16:17.009
it’s very inconvenient to live under such circumstances.

00:16:17.574 --> 00:16:23.042
I think people don’t even
understand the meaning of collectivity

00:16:23.122 --> 00:16:25.403
where there’s not the other,

00:16:25.483 --> 00:16:30.138
ananya, where there’s not the other,

00:16:30.218 --> 00:16:32.530
there’s no other personality.

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.582
This oneness with the whole

00:16:37.846 --> 00:16:42.609
gives you all the security that you want,

00:16:42.689 --> 00:16:46.001
all the joy you want

00:16:47.606 --> 00:16:53.821
and that's why Kundalini Awakening means collectivity.

00:16:55.412 --> 00:17:02.412
Unless and until you want pure collectivity in your being,

00:17:03.101 --> 00:17:05.394
Kundalini won't rise.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.996
Last but not the least,

00:17:12.076 --> 00:17:16.757
one must understand that as all these seven chakras

00:17:16.837 --> 00:17:21.630
I am working on are in a collective way held

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:23.990
by Me in My Virata.

00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:26.950
The quality of Viratangana is that,

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:32.110
that She creates this universal awareness within us,

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:34.750
the collectivity.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:42.270
And, if you do not realize that in modern times

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:49.230
we are in a spiritual path in a collective way only.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.870
This is what it is.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:58.910
Because we have reached to the state of Sahasrara

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:05.910
and here we have to have a collective working only,

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.030
there's no other way out!

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:15.830
This is what is to be absolutely realized.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:22.950
Anybody who tries to harm
the collectivity by bad behaviour,

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.270
or by anything,

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:27.630
will be thrown out, no doubt,

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:32.830
but also will fall into wrong hands.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:37.670
So collectivity is the work of Adi Shakti.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.750
Because at the Sahasrara,

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.430
at the Sahasrara,

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.830
at the Sahasrara is the rule of Virata.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.470
And the Power of Virata is the Viratangana.

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.470
Is the One Who does collectivity.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:56.310
This is the most important point we must know

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:01.950
if we cannot be collective - because of anything,

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.430
jealousy maybe, inferiority complex maybe, any,

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:07.630
anything which is coming from behind

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.190
like a worm crawling up -then,

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.630
know that something wrong with you,

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.750
nothing wrong with the collectivity.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:18.750
Don't criticize the collectivity,

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:22.950
till I Myself find it out, and I'll put it right.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:26.390
Keep to the collectivity, wisely

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:32.430
and earnestly and try to keep the collectivity together.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:40.590
Try to help to keep the people
collective to enjoy together.

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.190
Don't criticize each other;

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:48.830
only criticize yourself if you
are in the habit of criticism,

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.910
better criticize yourself.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:54.228
It's better, because these are habits also.

00:19:54.308 --> 00:19:56.173
May God bless you.
