00:00.001 --> 00:02.761
Navaratri Puja, Cabella Ligure, Italy
27th September, 1992

00:03.024 --> 00:08.149
Today is the first day of Navaratri.

00:10.024 --> 00:14.524
And when I found that the rain was there

00:14.857 --> 00:18.524
and all kinds of problems,

00:18.940 --> 00:21.399
and Vishnumaya was suggesting some things,

00:22.441 --> 00:25.524
I just consulted the calendar,

00:26.316 --> 00:30.316
and you will be amazed to know that in the calendar

00:30.691 --> 00:35.566
it is written that till five forty-five it’s not auspicious –

00:35.982 --> 00:37.566
it’s inauspicious.

00:38.149 --> 00:40.357
After five forty-five only

00:45.024 --> 00:47.483
the right thing starts,

00:47.940 --> 00:53.649
so just imagine, by calculation how it was correct

00:54.191 --> 01:01.065
that five forty-five we had to have this puja,

01:01.399 --> 01:03.524
after five forty-five.

01:03.774 --> 01:07.691
That is, the first day of Navaratri starts in Italy

01:07.691 --> 01:11.691
or in Europe after five forty-five.

01:12.107 --> 01:14.566
So it is something one must understand that

01:15.107 --> 01:18.733
the Chaitanya is working out everything,

01:19.024 --> 01:20.774
and it is giving all the suggestions;

01:21.357 --> 01:23.899
because I had not at all seen the, what you call the

01:23.899 --> 01:25.608
tithi (auspicious time),

01:25.608 --> 01:27.566
but I just felt that, I said that we’ll have it

01:27.774 --> 01:29.024
in the evening.

01:29.357 --> 01:31.024
And when I said it, I said “Let’s see this,”

01:31.024 --> 01:33.065
and there it was.

01:33.733 --> 01:36.191
There’s so many things we have to see,

01:37.773 --> 01:43.982
that whatever has been revealed to you, you can verify it.

01:44.773 --> 01:47.773
For example, I had said long time back

01:48.566 --> 01:53.232
that Mooladhara Chakra is made out of carbon,

01:53.566 --> 01:55.191
carbon atom,

01:55.857 --> 02:03.441
and if you see it from left to the right – right to the left,

02:03.982 --> 02:10.024
left side you see nothing but a swastika.

02:11.024 --> 02:14.773
So, now you see from left to the right,

02:15.316 --> 02:18.149
then you see Omkara;

02:18.524 --> 02:21.441
and once you see from down below upward,

02:22.399 --> 02:26.940
you see the alpha and omega.

02:27.566 --> 02:29.774
Now see, Christ has said that

02:30.191 --> 02:34.982
“I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

02:35.316 --> 02:38.857
So this swastika becomes Omkara,

02:39.232 --> 02:44.024
also becomes Christ.

02:45.691 --> 02:46.899
You can see it very clearly.

02:47.149 --> 02:51.649
Now we have got a beautiful picture of that,

02:52.274 --> 02:55.149
we have a tape, and I wanted to see you all that,

02:55.483 --> 02:57.733
but I don’t know how we can manage here.

02:57.733 --> 03:01.191
But I wish you all could see it, it’s so clear-cut.

03:01.441 --> 03:07.528
So alpha and omega, also these mathematical things

03:07.940 --> 03:11.892
have come to us from

03:13.774 --> 03:17.024
inside, from the Divine.

03:17.441 --> 03:19.357
This is not we have created.

03:19.774 --> 03:25.815
This was found out by some mathematicians

03:26.232 --> 03:28.232
who were realized souls,

03:28.691 --> 03:32.274
and they used this alpha and omega.

03:32.774 --> 03:36.608
It’s surprising how it shows so clearly that

03:36.940 --> 03:38.982
swastika becoming Omkar,

03:39.274 --> 03:43.982
and Omkar then becoming alpha and omega.

03:44.399 --> 03:50.232
So everything in Sahaja Yoga is tangible and

03:50.566 --> 03:53.107
can be verified.

03:53.774 --> 04:00.274
Now you are worshipping today the Durga,

04:00.774 --> 04:04.940
or all the nine forms of the Goddess.

04:05.815 --> 04:11.353
She came nine times on this Earth, according to this, that

04:11.774 --> 04:16.399
She fought all the people who were destroying

04:17.024 --> 04:19.399
the seekers,

04:19.435 --> 04:25.232
who were trying to make a mess of their lives.

04:26.065 --> 04:31.932
And these tortured saints,

04:32.024 --> 04:35.748
when they prayed to the Goddess – because none of the

04:35.773 --> 04:43.629
gods could do anything, and Sadashiva is never interfering

04:43.691 --> 04:46.232
with what the Goddess is doing –

04:46.608 --> 04:49.649
so they worshipped the Bhagawati,

04:50.191 --> 04:54.501
and then the incarnation of Hers came nine times,

04:54.649 --> 04:58.733
according to the need of the time.

04:59.982 --> 05:03.164
So every time you find Her confronting people who are

05:03.189 --> 05:07.166
extremely arrogant, self-opinionated,

05:07.191 --> 05:10.566
thinking no end of themselves;

05:11.024 --> 05:16.511
and the bhaktas are tortured by these self-opinionated

05:16.691 --> 05:19.982
horrible rakshasas.

05:20.274 --> 05:23.608
Now, in India when we cast the horoscope of a person,

05:23.608 --> 05:25.774
we have three categories of people:

05:26.065 --> 05:28.815
one are the devas, they’re called dev;

05:30.274 --> 05:34.744
the second ones are the ones which are manavas,

05:34.857 --> 05:36.815
means human beings;

05:37.065 --> 05:38.982
and the third ones are rakshasas.

05:40.107 --> 05:45.524
So I think I have got all of you from the dev categories,

05:45.773 --> 05:48.082
because you could not have taken to Sahaja Yoga

05:48.107 --> 05:50.774
that seriously unless and until you were there.

05:51.107 --> 05:54.149
After all, why should you believe Me also that

05:54.296 --> 05:57.107
when I say that there was the Durga, and there was

05:57.132 --> 06:01.483
this thing, and She did this and did that?

06:01.899 --> 06:05.899
It’s not that from one faith you have come out and now

06:05.991 --> 06:08.899
you are jumping onto another faith; it’s not like that.

06:09.149 --> 06:14.733
It is actually been proved – you can feel.

06:14.982 --> 06:18.124
For example, when you are raising the Kundalini

06:18.149 --> 06:20.566
on the center Heart,

06:21.107 --> 06:23.940
you can feel

06:24.316 --> 06:27.441
that on the center Heart if there is a catch,

06:27.773 --> 06:31.107
you have to take name of the Jagadamba.

06:31.899 --> 06:35.441
Unless and until you take Her name it won’t open out.

06:35.691 --> 06:39.048
Also when I am clearing out your center Heart,

06:39.107 --> 06:44.733
I have to also say, “Now I am in reality Jagadamba,”

06:45.024 --> 06:49.649
and then the Jagadamba within you awakens.

06:49.899 --> 06:52.624
So now you have verified it much more

06:52.649 --> 06:54.733
than the scientists have done.

06:54.733 --> 06:57.982
The scientists are going from outside,

06:58.399 --> 07:00.374
and they are not conclusive at all.

07:00.399 --> 07:02.940
Now if you have one problem, they will work it out;

07:03.399 --> 07:05.316
another problem – they work out problems,

07:05.649 --> 07:08.441
but they don’t know the basics,

07:08.773 --> 07:12.899
what the problems are, and where lies the solution.

07:13.316 --> 07:20.608
While you can see that once the Amba, this Kundalini

07:21.232 --> 07:25.065
who is the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

07:25.483 --> 07:28.149
of the Adi Shakti within you,

07:28.298 --> 07:33.441
when She rises through these different chakras,

07:33.982 --> 07:37.065
She gives them power because She’s the Power,

07:37.441 --> 07:39.065
She’s the Shakti.

07:39.231 --> 07:44.191
She is the desire power of Sadashiva.

07:45.773 --> 07:49.441
She is the complete power of Sadashiva.

07:49.982 --> 07:53.859
And so She gives the power totally to every chakra,

07:53.982 --> 07:57.357
by which all these chakras are enlightened

07:57.733 --> 08:00.024
and all the deities are awakened.

08:00.483 --> 08:04.149
Supposing we have no power of life,

08:04.483 --> 08:06.773
we’ll be like dead people.

08:07.608 --> 08:11.249
So these centers when they receive this power,

08:11.274 --> 08:14.065
this Shakti, then they are awakened.

08:14.316 --> 08:17.274
Now you have seen it, you can do it yourself.

08:17.566 --> 08:19.399
It’s all tangible,

08:19.815 --> 08:22.857
you can verify it.

08:23.269 --> 08:29.566
I have told you that She resides on the Heart center.

08:29.857 --> 08:32.483
Now see how Heart center is placed –

08:32.483 --> 08:34.483
also very interesting to see.

08:35.232 --> 08:41.249
While She is Jagadamba; but the Amba, means the pure

08:41.274 --> 08:47.733
form of power, resides in the triangular bone,

08:48.024 --> 08:49.707
like Kundalini.

08:49.858 --> 08:53.957
But Her form which is Jagadamba,

08:53.982 --> 08:58.316
where She is the Mother of the Universe,

08:58.691 --> 09:02.691
She resides on the Heart center.

09:03.316 --> 09:07.316
Now this Heart center is very important.

09:08.191 --> 09:12.874
When – I have already told you this, that when a child

09:12.899 --> 09:17.399
is about, till the twelve years of age,

09:17.815 --> 09:23.274
this center produces the ganas.

09:24.149 --> 09:29.649
Ganas are the workers on the left-hand side.

09:30.024 --> 09:35.191
They are like, we can say St. Michael is their leader,

09:35.733 --> 09:45.057
but their king is Ganapati, Ganesha.

09:46.691 --> 09:51.274
So first She has done is the ghatasthapana.

09:51.566 --> 09:54.608
“Ghatasthapana” means – you have done here now,

09:54.815 --> 09:58.107
this is the ghatasthapana (pot with coconut)

09:58.107 --> 10:00.149
This is the kumbha.

10:00.214 --> 10:03.107
Now this kumbha She has established first:

10:03.357 --> 10:04.982
that is the triangular bone.

10:04.982 --> 10:09.667
Now this is Her first work, that to establish this,

10:09.733 --> 10:11.733
your Mooladhara.

10:11.822 --> 10:16.024
So She established within you is innocence.

10:16.357 --> 10:19.733
She established innocence within you to begin with.

10:20.024 --> 10:25.149
So She has put this ghata in which She is staying

10:25.441 --> 10:27.191
as Kundalini now.

10:27.290 --> 10:32.875
So the first is that to establish the Kundalini

10:33.024 --> 10:37.773
in the triangular bone, and then to establish Shri Ganesha.

10:38.024 --> 10:43.316
This is the first work, by which whatever She is going

10:43.341 --> 10:47.103
to create now –

10:47.404 --> 10:52.649
all the Universes, the Earth, everything –

10:53.065 --> 10:57.207
whatever She is going to create has to be filled with

10:57.232 --> 10:59.774
innocence.

11:00.024 --> 11:04.566
Now if you see the stones,

11:04.899 --> 11:07.357
they’re innocent.

11:08.232 --> 11:10.207
If you hit the stone you’ll get the hit,

11:10.232 --> 11:13.024
otherwise it doesn’t come up and hit you.

11:13.399 --> 11:15.483
They’re innocent.

11:16.357 --> 11:23.191
If you see the rivers, they’re innocent.

11:24.815 --> 11:29.524
Everything that has been created as matter is innocent.

11:30.107 --> 11:34.874
It is not cunning, it is not manipulating,

11:34.899 --> 11:37.774
it is not aggressive – nothing of the kind.

11:38.232 --> 11:39.316
They’re innocent,

11:39.691 --> 11:44.232
means they’re under the complete order of God Almighty.

11:44.483 --> 11:48.298
They do not have their own free will to do what they like.

11:49.815 --> 11:55.999
Whatever is done is with the absolutely under complete

11:56.024 --> 11:59.024
command of God Almighty,

11:59.357 --> 12:03.274
and so they are, we can say they’re innocent,

12:03.733 --> 12:08.857
because they have no free will to do what they like.

12:09.274 --> 12:14.065
So then if you see the animals also,

12:14.399 --> 12:19.107
they also are innocent, except for very few.

12:19.441 --> 12:22.691
Most of them are innocent, innocent in the sense that

12:23.107 --> 12:27.249
they are called as “pashu”– means they are completely

12:27.274 --> 12:30.691
under the control, pasha, of God Almighty.

12:30.940 --> 12:34.826
A tiger will behave like a tiger,

12:34.940 --> 12:37.357
and a snake will behave like a snake.

12:37.733 --> 12:41.832
But in human beings somebody will behave like a tiger,

12:41.857 --> 12:45.815
tomorrow like a snake and third day like a worm.

12:46.191 --> 12:48.191
There’s no steadiness.

12:48.566 --> 12:51.524
For this you cannot say that this gentleman is today tiger,

12:51.774 --> 12:53.940
so tomorrow he will not be a snake.

12:54.316 --> 12:59.899
They have no free will to change their individuality.

13:00.691 --> 13:02.733
They are left alone.

13:03.149 --> 13:06.483
So that is not the job of the Shakti to bother.

13:06.774 --> 13:09.393
That’s already been created, they are there,

13:09.483 --> 13:12.357
and they are existing.

13:13.024 --> 13:16.065
They have a purpose, that’s why they are there;

13:16.483 --> 13:20.483
and the purpose is only one, is to support human beings,

13:20.815 --> 13:23.773
because you are at the epitome of evolution.

13:24.191 --> 13:29.778
So She has created all these things just for you

13:29.815 --> 13:36.232
to be created, and ultimately to get your Self-realization;

13:36.566 --> 13:38.441
to have meaning for your life,

13:38.466 --> 13:40.566
to get connected to this all-pervading Power,

13:40.982 --> 13:44.024
to enter into the Kingdom of God.

13:44.441 --> 13:46.024
All is Her work.

13:46.380 --> 13:50.608
So we can say nine times She came, and the tenth time

13:50.899 --> 13:54.733
She is supposed to give Realization to all of you.

13:55.524 --> 13:59.899
But at the tenth time, all these three powers are

13:59.924 --> 14:02.899
joined together – that’s why it’s called Trigunatmika.

14:02.978 --> 14:05.316
That’s why Buddha has said “Matreya”–

14:05.340 --> 14:09.483
means three Mothers put together.

14:10.024 --> 14:15.666
So this Power when it starts acting, it has the complete

14:15.691 --> 14:22.773
control over all your three channels and seven centers –

14:23.149 --> 14:25.191
complete control,

14:25.815 --> 14:31.541
as if without the permission or without the taking

14:31.566 --> 14:37.773
the name of this Power, you cannot achieve anything.

14:39.483 --> 14:41.191
Is a fact,

14:41.566 --> 14:44.441
and that is where human beings fail,

14:44.691 --> 14:46.608
because they have a free will,

14:46.899 --> 14:50.541
and they don’t know why to obey anyone or why to listen

14:50.566 --> 14:53.899
to anyone, and why to accept anyone.

14:54.483 --> 14:59.733
That’s why, though you have to be given Self-realization,

15:00.024 --> 15:02.149
the task is very difficult;

15:03.065 --> 15:06.773
because you are not used to

15:07.316 --> 15:10.773
a way where you don’t have to use your free will.

15:11.733 --> 15:13.915
Specially in the Western countries,

15:13.940 --> 15:18.274
people have choices even for their cereals.

15:18.524 --> 15:24.691
I was told that in America there are 126 types of cereals.

15:25.524 --> 15:28.232
This kind of nonsense if you are doing,

15:28.483 --> 15:33.748
your ego definitely bloats out, and you think

15:33.773 --> 15:39.232
that “We have a right to decide for ourself.”

15:39.608 --> 15:43.040
And you cannot accept somebody who can tell you that

15:43.065 --> 15:45.815
this is not right, and this is not right.

15:46.232 --> 15:54.316
So the same Power has now been awakened in

15:54.488 --> 15:56.555
the Paramachaitanya.

15:56.758 --> 16:00.541
Now, this awakening into the Paramachaitanya is doing

16:00.566 --> 16:04.566
marvellous work, which you can see clearly.

16:04.842 --> 16:08.649
Firstly, you have seen My photographs.

16:09.232 --> 16:11.458
You see My photographs, you are stunned,

16:11.483 --> 16:14.316
you are surprised. I mean,

16:14.341 --> 16:17.868
I Myself don’t know what is this Paramachaitanya

16:17.899 --> 16:19.566
is busy with.

16:19.649 --> 16:24.124
It is so activated that all the time it is working out

16:24.149 --> 16:30.149
to convince you people about the truth.

16:30.483 --> 16:34.024
If it was so active at the time of Christ,

16:34.274 --> 16:36.316
would have been much better.

16:36.316 --> 16:39.291
But it had to be this way, because human beings are

16:39.316 --> 16:43.357
the most difficult things to manage.

16:43.691 --> 16:47.458
They have been given freedom; that too,

16:47.483 --> 16:48.773
you’d be amazed,

16:49.107 --> 16:52.899
that the freedom was given to Adam and Eve,

16:53.149 --> 16:54.483
but how it was achieved,

16:54.483 --> 16:56.107
we should understand this.

16:56.356 --> 16:59.082
In the Gnostics Bible it has come out what I’ve been

16:59.107 --> 17:06.494
saying, that Adam and Eve, both of them

17:06.899 --> 17:12.274
were like pashus, under the complete control of God –

17:12.608 --> 17:13.982
no free will.

17:14.316 --> 17:20.773
They would have lived in the nude in the garden of Eden,

17:21.065 --> 17:26.082
would not have even thought of knowing anything

17:26.107 --> 17:30.107
more than that, but to eat, live like animals.

17:30.357 --> 17:32.857
They were just like animals.

17:33.149 --> 17:38.399
Then it is the Shakti itself took the form of a snake,

17:38.774 --> 17:40.331
and went and told them that

17:40.357 --> 17:43.399
“You must have the fruit of Knowledge.”

17:43.774 --> 17:46.065
She wanted to evolve.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.483
That was not the idea of God Almighty,

17:49.774 --> 17:51.483
because it’s quite a headache, you know,

17:51.733 --> 17:54.274
to do such a thing.

17:54.274 --> 17:56.541
He thought, “What is the need to have

17:56.566 --> 17:59.065
such headaches around Me?”

17:59.566 --> 18:02.649
But Shakti knew Her own style.

18:02.857 --> 18:08.225
She knew that She is capable of lots of miracles,

18:08.316 --> 18:12.294
and She can make these human beings understand

18:12.357 --> 18:15.749
the Knowledge, and She can really make them

18:15.774 --> 18:18.608
knowledgeable.

18:18.803 --> 18:21.149
So She said, “You must eat this fruit,

18:21.317 --> 18:28.649
and you must try to know the Knowledge.”

18:29.773 --> 18:35.982
So a new type of human race started,

18:36.649 --> 18:41.441
which wanted to know what is the Knowledge.

18:41.691 --> 18:45.082
You have seen that we had all kinds

18:45.107 --> 18:47.691
of primitive people before.

18:48.024 --> 18:51.107
Then they started evolving, evolving.

18:51.483 --> 18:55.742
Now, I have to say that

18:55.774 --> 19:02.567
the first creation which took place before that,

19:03.191 --> 19:06.857
there were other higher creations

19:07.400 --> 19:16.608
which were planned by Adi Shakti

19:16.652 --> 19:20.857
to plan out the whole thing.

19:21.019 --> 19:23.857
So She created Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha,

19:24.191 --> 19:30.749
and She created their lokas, their atmospheres or you can

19:30.774 --> 19:33.715
say their areas.

19:33.795 --> 19:36.107
In that all the planning was done,

19:36.235 --> 19:41.098
how we can achieve this to make these animals realized

19:41.149 --> 19:44.107
souls, from animal to human beings,

19:44.279 --> 19:47.774
and from human beings to realized souls.

19:48.149 --> 19:50.774
It was a very big problem.

19:51.065 --> 19:55.040
That’s how they created, you see – as you know that

19:55.065 --> 19:56.649
Vishnu had His own loka,

19:56.857 --> 19:58.399
Mahesha had His own loka,

19:58.649 --> 20:01.274
and Brahmadeva had His own loka.

20:01.524 --> 20:05.566
And they decided among themselves how best we can do it.

20:05.566 --> 20:09.065
Because these three channels were created in human

20:09.316 --> 20:11.232
beings later on.

20:11.232 --> 20:15.748
Out of the three channels came out these three Shaktis:

20:15.773 --> 20:17.733
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

20:18.024 --> 20:21.416
They produced two children,

20:21.441 --> 20:23.913
one shakti and one the brother,

20:23.982 --> 20:26.540
and then intermarriage and all that took place,

20:26.565 --> 20:30.399
in a way – marriage not in the human way,

20:30.555 --> 20:33.733
not in the human way we should say, but they were,

20:34.071 --> 20:39.441
the energy was given to the potential man.

20:39.815 --> 20:43.499
So the woman, who was the energy representing,

20:43.524 --> 20:45.982
was given to a man.

20:47.899 --> 20:49.774
All these things happened,

20:50.233 --> 20:56.608
and they chose to work it out in human beings.

20:57.065 --> 21:00.982
It happened like this, that the first working

21:01.399 --> 21:05.691
somehow or other was very effective in India.

21:06.107 --> 21:08.857
Or maybe they chose India because Indian climate

21:09.316 --> 21:10.357
is so good.

21:10.406 --> 21:12.608
I mean, you know definitely there are six seasons.

21:12.608 --> 21:14.291
It’s not like this anytime,

21:14.316 --> 21:18.440
like this irrational rain comes in, like London

21:18.566 --> 21:19.773
you have to play football also with

21:19.773 --> 21:22.357
an umbrella on your head!

21:23.710 --> 21:27.733
So there are exactly six seasons in India,

21:28.024 --> 21:30.107
and they are so well balanced.

21:30.483 --> 21:36.733
That’s why this Paramachaitanya is also called as

21:36.733 --> 21:40.663
“Ritambhara pragya” in India – not here,

21:40.688 --> 21:41.966
we cannot say.

21:41.991 --> 21:44.593
“Ritambhara pragya” means the one

21:44.691 --> 21:47.899
which is the Knowledge, pragya,

21:48.274 --> 21:52.524
means the one enlightened Knowledge,

21:52.617 --> 21:56.274
of the one which makes seasons.

21:56.899 --> 22:01.441
Because here ritambhara pragya is in a doldrum.

22:01.774 --> 22:03.857
It’s not at all understanding,

22:04.316 --> 22:06.608
because of the human beings as they are.

22:07.024 --> 22:11.199
They are so much scatterbrain, I should say,

22:11.399 --> 22:14.691
that even the nature has become scatterbrain here,

22:15.024 --> 22:17.708
and cannot understand how to deal with such human

22:17.733 --> 22:19.524
beings – is a fact.

22:19.551 --> 22:22.649
But in India it is the six seasons are there,

22:23.024 --> 22:26.773
and these six seasons are absolutely known.

22:28.524 --> 22:33.232
One has not studied the astrology of India,

22:33.566 --> 22:35.825
but they have their own astrology –

22:35.850 --> 22:37.899
of course, I don’t believe in it.

22:38.316 --> 22:42.857
But the, at the level of a human level

22:43.191 --> 22:45.441
you can see how they depict

22:45.857 --> 22:49.542
and how they can exactly say when it will rain,

22:49.621 --> 22:53.024
when it will not rain; what will happen, that will happen.

22:53.566 --> 22:56.441
Even about the stars, that such a star will be coming.

22:56.441 --> 22:59.341
Now this has been done in thousands of years back.

22:59.399 --> 23:00.608
They will exactly say

23:00.608 --> 23:02.999
what time which star will be coming nearer,

23:03.024 --> 23:05.220
what star are today governing,

23:05.323 --> 23:07.107
tomorrow what will be the star there.

23:07.554 --> 23:11.940
In those olden days they had studied all these things.

23:12.441 --> 23:15.666
When I see here, I don’t know what was the situation

23:15.691 --> 23:18.441
at that time in these Western countries,

23:18.899 --> 23:21.864
whether there were human beings or not I don’t know;

23:21.919 --> 23:28.399
but historically I think it was not such a developed place.

23:29.608 --> 23:35.149
So then all this arrangement was made,

23:35.149 --> 23:40.291
and human beings were made to understand

23:40.316 --> 23:43.857
that there is God.

23:45.232 --> 23:49.441
The saints were respected – I’m telling you in India –

23:49.774 --> 23:51.608
real saints were respected,

23:51.850 --> 23:56.566
and they made different observations.

23:56.899 --> 24:00.566
Now when I read say, Adi Shankaracharya,

24:00.940 --> 24:04.691
I am amazed how he knows so many things about Me.

24:05.065 --> 24:08.166
He knows how My knee looks like,

24:08.191 --> 24:11.746
he knows how many lines I have on My back,

24:11.815 --> 24:14.991
how many – I mean, it is very amazing how this man

24:15.016 --> 24:17.893
knows everything about Me.

24:18.124 --> 24:21.239
That means through his meditative power he could

24:21.264 --> 24:23.566
envisage Me – he never saw Me.

24:23.982 --> 24:27.357
The description and everything is so clear-cut.

24:27.773 --> 24:31.316
Now if you say the thousand names of the Goddess,

24:31.773 --> 24:36.357
thousand names of the Goddess are so precise.

24:36.691 --> 24:40.024
I mean, you can verify them in Me, I am just like that.

24:40.141 --> 24:43.524
Whatever it is, good or bad, whatever is said about Me

24:43.627 --> 24:46.357
is there, is a fact.

24:46.742 --> 24:50.290
And it is the Knowledge of these people

24:50.315 --> 24:54.166
is most remarkable: how did they know that

24:54.191 --> 24:56.773
a Goddess is like that?

24:56.798 --> 25:00.107
Certain of My things which I also don’t know,

25:00.107 --> 25:04.815
but they are there, and they have described.

25:05.483 --> 25:06.940
It’s very surprising.

25:07.399 --> 25:09.940
So their meditative power in India was great.

25:10.316 --> 25:15.274
The reason was, our seasons were disciplined,

25:15.733 --> 25:18.065
people are disciplined.

25:18.524 --> 25:20.997
In India most of the people get up early in the morning,

25:21.022 --> 25:23.399
do their pujas, everything, take their baths,

25:23.857 --> 25:28.624
and they go for work, come home, be with the family, have

25:28.649 --> 25:33.145
their food, and then sing some songs and bhajans,

25:33.316 --> 25:36.982
and then sleep off – normally.

25:37.608 --> 25:39.357
Very disciplined.

25:39.691 --> 25:41.773
They don’t go on holidays,

25:42.107 --> 25:44.691
they don’t get into drinking and things like that.

25:44.982 --> 25:48.431
Normally in the family, no question, if somebody drinks

25:48.456 --> 25:50.545
he’s thrown out of the house.

25:50.728 --> 25:54.107
He’s condemned as a leper.

25:54.483 --> 25:58.399
He’s called as a daruda, means he is a drunkard.

25:59.399 --> 26:02.274
And even nowadays some people are drinking,

26:02.625 --> 26:07.688
but they too, they hide their drinking.

26:07.815 --> 26:10.274
Nobody drinks in the presence of others.

26:10.773 --> 26:14.082
I mean, I don’t know, their influence might increase

26:14.107 --> 26:16.441
and people will start openly drinking,

26:16.774 --> 26:19.773
but normally they don’t.

26:20.691 --> 26:24.166
So because of these six seasons being absolutely in

26:24.191 --> 26:30.149
discipline, we knew what to do when, and how to do it.

26:30.566 --> 26:35.232
Now, people could live in the jungles.

26:35.608 --> 26:38.232
Like in England, if you have to go out it takes fifteen,

26:38.483 --> 26:41.833
twenty minutes: you have to wear your shoes, socks,

26:41.858 --> 26:44.773
your coat, your under- this thing, that thing;

26:44.804 --> 26:47.815
otherwise you can’t get out.

26:47.885 --> 26:50.541
And you start from one place; reaching another place

26:50.566 --> 26:53.499
you’ll find it is raining heavily, you have nothing,

26:53.524 --> 26:55.649
you get drenched.

26:56.232 --> 26:59.107
But this is not so in India.

26:59.132 --> 27:02.458
It’s so balanced that when you come, all of you come

27:02.483 --> 27:04.608
in winter-time, you have seen it.

27:04.647 --> 27:07.857
It doesn’t rain suddenly, it doesn’t happen like that

27:08.149 --> 27:09.774
at a wrong time.

27:09.820 --> 27:12.899
You can stay outside as long as you want.

27:13.191 --> 27:16.065
So these people could live in the jungles,

27:16.357 --> 27:20.815
in the sense we didn’t have so much idea of comfort at all.

27:20.815 --> 27:24.191
In a simple little hut they could live:

27:24.566 --> 27:26.232
a little protection from the sun,

27:26.649 --> 27:30.566
and protection from the rain for rainy season,

27:30.857 --> 27:32.149
that’s all.

27:33.353 --> 27:36.857
And they had very little needs of life.

27:37.524 --> 27:39.332
And we didn’t use plastics – I mean,

27:39.357 --> 27:41.566
there were no plastics that time, or even now

27:41.774 --> 27:44.544
we don’t use plastics.

27:44.608 --> 27:49.082
And we used to have few thalis and things.

27:49.107 --> 27:52.274
In a small family also they’ll have just thalis,

27:52.608 --> 27:56.940
which were just permanently with the family.

27:57.357 --> 28:00.733
Now I find that such a difference there is.

28:00.733 --> 28:04.309
You see, in simple living what happens,

28:04.441 --> 28:09.691
that you do not take out

28:09.982 --> 28:12.232
all the wealth from the Mother Earth.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.733
There’s no ecological problem there.

28:15.099 --> 28:19.499
But by having as you are saying so many glasses for this,

28:19.524 --> 28:22.458
so many glasses for that, all this kind of thing that you

28:22.483 --> 28:28.524
produce has no aesthetic value, and has no durability.

28:28.857 --> 28:32.124
So then you have mountains and mountains of these huge

28:32.149 --> 28:35.541
big plastics which cannot be burnt, which cannot be

28:35.566 --> 28:39.940
thrown away, if you throw away in the sea it floats,

28:40.316 --> 28:42.982
and such problems are there.

28:43.135 --> 28:47.456
So this Shakti that was working in those days

28:47.483 --> 28:52.815
was in them to make them seekers;

28:53.441 --> 28:56.232
because they didn’t have to do anything else, you know.

28:56.232 --> 28:58.748
It’s all right, you have food to eat,

28:58.773 --> 29:00.024
you have place to sleep,

29:00.024 --> 29:03.649
finished – not much to be done,

29:03.940 --> 29:06.274
living so happily.

29:06.649 --> 29:09.877
With all these

29:10.441 --> 29:15.357
comforts in the way that so little a demand on your time,

29:15.773 --> 29:18.330
they had time, lot of time.

29:18.425 --> 29:22.899
And with that time, what did they do?

29:23.014 --> 29:27.988
They didn’t go, say, for that, for a swimming or

29:28.107 --> 29:31.357
ballroom dancing, or nothing of the kind.

29:31.579 --> 29:34.733
With that time they meditated.

29:35.065 --> 29:37.773
And when that time meditation started,

29:37.974 --> 29:43.524
then they started realizing what is the divine Power,

29:43.647 --> 29:46.982
what is Divinity, what is God.

29:47.524 --> 29:50.316
For example I’ll tell you, here people discuss even

29:50.439 --> 29:54.355
the private life of Christ, and say all kinds of things;

29:54.483 --> 29:57.566
I mean, it’s impossible in India, nobody does that.

29:57.899 --> 30:00.899
It never comes to their head that

30:01.316 --> 30:03.608
how Krishna had sixteen thousand wives –

30:03.815 --> 30:06.583
must be some reason, He is God after all. God is God,

30:06.608 --> 30:10.372
youare a human being – how can you know about God,

30:10.399 --> 30:12.232
because you have come through Him?

30:12.318 --> 30:14.608
They don’t discuss such nonsensical things,

30:14.815 --> 30:15.649
must be that.

30:15.725 --> 30:18.316
And now when I told them these are His powers,

30:18.341 --> 30:20.049
sixteen thousand, they said, “Yes.”

30:20.274 --> 30:23.399
Then, the five wives were the five elements – “Yes.”

30:23.733 --> 30:25.940
They are God.

30:26.191 --> 30:27.773
Nobody discusses these things.

30:27.773 --> 30:30.441
God is – how can you understand God?

30:30.691 --> 30:33.107
Can you understand Me? You can’t.

30:33.357 --> 30:36.691
Try – you can’t understand Me.

30:36.691 --> 30:38.773
Very difficult.

30:38.845 --> 30:41.441
So you can’t understand,

30:41.857 --> 30:43.274
you can’t understand God.

30:43.733 --> 30:45.232
Please understand one thing,

30:45.315 --> 30:48.691
that for to understand God is an impossibility.

30:48.799 --> 30:50.733
But you can be in connection with God,

30:51.274 --> 30:52.815
you can be in the company of God,

30:52.939 --> 30:54.773
you can be blessed by God,

30:55.274 --> 30:56.975
you can be looked after by God,

30:57.000 --> 30:59.940
you can know lots of things about God;

31:00.045 --> 31:04.316
but you cannot understand.

31:05.566 --> 31:09.499
This is another thing one has to know,

31:09.524 --> 31:13.458
that you cannot understand why God does these things,

31:13.483 --> 31:15.982
why He does this, why He does that.

31:16.316 --> 31:19.024
You cannot understand, you cannot explain it.

31:19.232 --> 31:21.107
I mean, somebody can even say here,

31:21.107 --> 31:23.107
“Why did He make swastika?”

31:23.250 --> 31:25.024
Then, “Why did He make Omkara?”

31:25.185 --> 31:28.124
I mean here the people are so arrogant that they can even

31:28.149 --> 31:32.149
ask God, “Why did You exist?”

31:32.312 --> 31:34.024
They can go to that limit, you know,

31:34.340 --> 31:37.940
there’s nothing surprising.

31:38.316 --> 31:41.940
So this arrogance, this ego has blinded us from God.

31:42.125 --> 31:44.499
We think no end of ourselves,

31:44.524 --> 31:46.232
we are very self-opinionated,

31:46.257 --> 31:49.232
and we do not know much about it.

31:49.556 --> 31:54.832
So this Power, this Shakti is the one which has given you

31:54.857 --> 31:57.514
Self-realization, will also give you God-realization;

31:57.554 --> 31:59.733
but still you will not understand God.

31:59.782 --> 32:03.691
You have to go above God to understand Him.

32:05.024 --> 32:06.733
How will you understand?

32:06.733 --> 32:08.441
Supposing there’s something below you,

32:08.441 --> 32:09.774
you can understand;

32:10.065 --> 32:12.040
but something above you, how will you understand?

32:12.065 --> 32:15.173
Supposing somebody is down below in Cabella

32:15.232 --> 32:17.332
and wants to understand about My house,

32:17.357 --> 32:19.854
will he understand?

32:19.879 --> 32:25.815
He has to go above the Cabella to see My house.

32:26.524 --> 32:29.351
So the Source from which we have come,

32:29.483 --> 32:31.733
we cannot understand that.

32:32.065 --> 32:34.624
We cannot judge, we cannot say why;

32:34.649 --> 32:40.957
that is God’s wish, God’s desire, whatever He does.

32:40.982 --> 32:42.857
So what we have to say: whatever His wish,

32:43.274 --> 32:46.065
we’ll be happy with that.

32:46.450 --> 32:49.691
And the power that is within you is Amba,

32:49.989 --> 32:52.649
is the desire power of God itself.

32:52.882 --> 32:55.166
So whatever your wish is, means that

32:55.191 --> 32:59.982
His wish is that you should enter into His Kingdom.

33:00.245 --> 33:03.149
Now you enter into the Kingdom of God.

33:03.462 --> 33:05.940
Then the Shakti makes you

33:06.147 --> 33:11.357
sit on different beautiful positions,

33:12.899 --> 33:15.790
and some are sitting in the Heart of God,

33:15.815 --> 33:18.773
some are sitting in the Sahasrara of God,

33:18.798 --> 33:21.857
in the Kingdom of God.

33:22.112 --> 33:25.191
Now you should assume your power.

33:25.392 --> 33:28.624
On Navaratri now, you should understand that it has now

33:28.649 --> 33:33.483
crossed the limit and now we are on the tenth position,

33:33.773 --> 33:35.024
where you must assume.

33:35.049 --> 33:37.316
I have told you many a times, now believe that

33:37.316 --> 33:39.566
you are Sahaja yogis.

33:39.566 --> 33:42.733
Believe that you are,

33:42.982 --> 33:45.691
you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.608
You cannot judge God, you cannot say why She does that,

33:48.608 --> 33:51.040
why She does that, why He does that.

33:51.065 --> 33:53.773
You cannot say that – that’s different.

33:54.065 --> 33:58.399
But when you sit there, then it is not an assembly,

33:58.733 --> 34:02.195
it is not like a politician fighting, no;

34:02.346 --> 34:05.925
it is that you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

34:06.065 --> 34:10.441
blessed by God, looked after, protected, nourished,

34:10.572 --> 34:14.316
and made knowledgeable.

34:14.691 --> 34:17.899
But still this arrogance has to go down,

34:18.149 --> 34:21.899
that we can understand why it happens.

34:22.265 --> 34:25.989
That humility is very important for us;

34:26.037 --> 34:29.940
otherwise this power cannot take you beyond.

34:30.295 --> 34:33.065
Now as it is, it has crossed the Sahasrara,

34:33.249 --> 34:36.733
now this power has to go higher and higher.

34:36.982 --> 34:41.773
For that, first you should be humble.

34:42.191 --> 34:44.832
“Humble” doesn’t mean that it should be something

34:44.857 --> 34:49.524
artificial humility of a businessman, or a politician.

34:49.899 --> 34:53.483
It is a humbleness is within your heart,

34:53.982 --> 34:57.999
that “Oh God, we don’t want to understand You,

34:58.024 --> 35:00.232
You are too great.

35:00.608 --> 35:05.608
But let us know ourselves.”

35:05.908 --> 35:08.649
And then you’ll be amazed that He has made you

35:08.856 --> 35:11.399
like His own image.

35:11.451 --> 35:14.940
That means He has given you all the powers.

35:15.204 --> 35:16.608
He has made you.

35:16.982 --> 35:21.441
When He has made you, you cannot make Him.

35:21.466 --> 35:24.566
He is the Source, you cannot make Him.

35:25.064 --> 35:28.107
He has made you in His own image.

35:28.483 --> 35:34.608
Now, what you can do is to make others in His image.

35:35.024 --> 35:37.149
These powers are with you.

35:37.193 --> 35:39.158
But the first thing you have to have,

35:39.357 --> 35:41.191
the discipline within yourself,

35:41.396 --> 35:43.107
that is missing.

35:43.566 --> 35:45.458
People cannot discipline themselves – means

35:45.483 --> 35:47.232
if they cannot control themselves,

35:47.566 --> 35:50.899
how can they control anyone?

35:52.940 --> 35:56.483
No discipline means you cannot control yourself.

35:56.940 --> 35:58.649
So the discipline should be that first

35:59.065 --> 36:01.773
you must see that you control yourself,

36:02.191 --> 36:06.316
because now you are in the Kingdom of God.

36:06.773 --> 36:09.857
Have you seen a film called “Mr. Bean”

36:10.191 --> 36:13.566
where they show a stupid man, you see?

36:14.147 --> 36:18.649
So what happens that when you are now come to the court

36:19.107 --> 36:20.510
of the Goddess,

36:20.574 --> 36:23.195
when you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

36:23.441 --> 36:26.857
you are made to sit on your throne in a dignified way.

36:27.274 --> 36:31.107
But you start behaving like Mr. Bean, you see.

36:31.180 --> 36:34.109
You don’t know how to sit on your seat,

36:34.134 --> 36:36.524
you want to sit on the sides,

36:36.659 --> 36:40.483
you want to sit on the wall or do all kinds of things.

36:40.733 --> 36:42.399
There’s no discipline.

36:42.616 --> 36:44.524
You have to have the discipline.

36:44.647 --> 36:45.941
Where are you sitting?

36:45.996 --> 36:48.857
You are sitting in the Kingdom of God.

36:49.196 --> 36:50.859
So you should have that dignity,

36:51.002 --> 36:52.773
you should have that affection,

36:52.956 --> 36:54.773
you should have that compassion,

36:54.798 --> 36:59.441
you must have that love, and the dedication.

36:59.510 --> 37:02.316
But if it is not there, then this power is useless,

37:02.691 --> 37:05.857
because you are the vehicle of that power.

37:06.062 --> 37:10.138
Supposing I have to take water, I have to have glass

37:10.483 --> 37:12.940
which is emptied inside.

37:13.004 --> 37:14.733
If it is already full with ego,

37:15.149 --> 37:17.336
what can you put inside that?

37:17.361 --> 37:20.191
Or if it is a stone, you can’t drink water out of that,

37:20.608 --> 37:28.274
you’ll have to dig in the space for putting the water.

37:28.649 --> 37:31.404
So if you are already filled with your own ideas,

37:31.524 --> 37:37.975
with your own conveniences, with your own progress

37:38.024 --> 37:41.691
or whatever it is, only that,

37:41.982 --> 37:45.024
then you cannot rise very high.

37:45.483 --> 37:48.332
You have to surrender fully there, to say that

37:48.357 --> 37:51.940
“Mother, whatever is Your desire,

37:52.483 --> 37:58.316
that we do not want to have any our individual desire.”

37:58.815 --> 38:00.857
Then the desire of God will work.

38:01.096 --> 38:04.249
You want Kundalini to work for you which is the desire

38:04.274 --> 38:05.524
of God,

38:05.549 --> 38:09.399
not your desire, which is independent of your desire,

38:09.741 --> 38:14.982
but is the one which will fulfill your

38:15.316 --> 38:17.316
complete so-called desires,

38:17.756 --> 38:19.982
without even your Knowledge.

38:20.113 --> 38:23.574
Miracles after miracles will happen, so many miracles

38:23.608 --> 38:26.451
that now we do not know how to compile the book

38:26.476 --> 38:27.899
even on miracles.

38:27.924 --> 38:30.666
But these miracles are coming to you because you are

38:30.691 --> 38:32.065
realized souls.

38:32.815 --> 38:36.150
Your attention should be all right, you must see and

38:36.253 --> 38:40.142
introspect yourself. “I am sitting in the Kingdom of God,

38:40.245 --> 38:41.940
now what is my situation?

38:42.399 --> 38:45.748
Is it worth it, am I worth it, am I behaving in the same

38:45.773 --> 38:50.940
manner, or still I don’t believe?”

38:51.524 --> 38:53.524
If you don’t believe, how can you rise?

38:53.899 --> 38:56.624
“Believe” means that you have seen something,

38:56.649 --> 38:58.483
you have known something which is tangible,

38:58.544 --> 39:00.982
you have got the experience of it.

39:01.357 --> 39:05.733
Still you are not surrendered.

39:05.939 --> 39:08.274
If you surrender to the will of God,

39:08.608 --> 39:11.024
then everything is taken charge.

39:11.399 --> 39:13.940
It will never let you down, no question;

39:14.067 --> 39:16.940
and everything, all things which look like

39:17.165 --> 39:21.104
mountains of difficulties and obstructions

39:21.274 --> 39:25.329
you will surpass, just like an aeroplane goes over it.

39:25.424 --> 39:28.857
You won’t have any problem whatsoever.

39:29.001 --> 39:32.666
So one thing today, I am very happy that this puja is done

39:32.691 --> 39:39.502
by the people from a country which is discipline

39:39.527 --> 39:44.149
is very important – that is, Switzerland.

39:44.174 --> 39:50.899
But their discipline is for bad things, not for good.

39:54.274 --> 39:57.483
For example, they have a military:

39:57.815 --> 40:00.798
who is going to go to that far-fetched place, you see,

40:00.823 --> 40:02.020
to attack?

40:02.553 --> 40:03.678
No one.

40:03.703 --> 40:05.079
Why do they have military?

40:05.490 --> 40:07.760
And compulsory military, do you know that?

40:08.206 --> 40:10.748
Because they have looted other people’s money and

40:10.773 --> 40:13.507
kept them there, like thugs.

40:13.634 --> 40:16.082
So all that money is in their banks, and they are worried

40:16.107 --> 40:19.401
that any time, you see, any person can come up and

40:19.441 --> 40:26.589
demand the money, and may start using the power

40:26.614 --> 40:29.113
of destruction on us.

40:29.706 --> 40:32.661
So, because they are doing wrong, that’s why they

40:32.815 --> 40:37.029
have a military – out of fear, just out of fear.

40:37.084 --> 40:39.608
There is no need to have any military there.

40:39.608 --> 40:41.982
But everybody has to go to military

40:42.007 --> 40:44.649
and join the military,

40:44.982 --> 40:51.691
because they are thieves of the worst type.

40:52.566 --> 40:56.232
Then secondly, they have also very much slavery

40:56.257 --> 40:58.623
of the watch, which human beings have made,

40:58.648 --> 41:01.024
God has not made.

41:01.119 --> 41:04.233
So the watch is important, because they are

41:04.274 --> 41:06.815
making watches.

41:06.908 --> 41:10.149
If they are making watches and if they do not slave

41:10.399 --> 41:15.357
under the watches, who will buy their watches?

41:15.532 --> 41:18.030
They will say, “What’s the use of you all have watches,

41:18.133 --> 41:19.608
and the way you are?”

41:19.633 --> 41:21.649
So they are very disciplined.

41:21.779 --> 41:25.499
Not only, they also are, I mean extremely

41:25.524 --> 41:27.524
as they’ve shown yesterday, they’re really

41:27.857 --> 41:32.773
too much of cleanliness in them.

41:34.024 --> 41:36.689
Some of the girls who were married – I must say

41:36.714 --> 41:39.483
I’m sorry to say this, but it is a fact –

41:39.700 --> 41:41.815
were married from Switzerland,

41:41.900 --> 41:43.749
and the reports have come that

41:43.774 --> 41:45.483
“Mother, they must have been maid-servants

41:45.651 --> 41:47.399
or bar-maids.”

41:47.628 --> 41:49.191
So I said, “Why?”

41:49.319 --> 41:51.374
“If something falls down somewhere, immediately

41:51.399 --> 41:53.065
they’ll pick it up and keep there.

41:53.117 --> 41:56.291
If something even – it’s just like, like in the guests,

41:56.316 --> 41:58.144
you see the guests are sitting

41:58.169 --> 41:59.922
and they have no time to talk.

41:59.947 --> 42:02.261
There’s no question of talking to each other,

42:02.286 --> 42:03.134
there’s nothing;

42:03.159 --> 42:04.899
all the time they are worried about

42:04.924 --> 42:06.408
this thing, this is getting dirty,

42:06.433 --> 42:09.183
that is getting dirty, like maid-servants.”

42:09.805 --> 42:11.065
Can you imagine?

42:11.152 --> 42:14.566
This has also come from the same horrible disciplining

42:14.591 --> 42:15.940
that they have.

42:16.000 --> 42:20.815
This disciplining is not divine disciplining.

42:21.274 --> 42:22.940
Nature is not like that.

42:23.316 --> 42:26.040
If you see the nature, see how the nature is beautiful,

42:26.065 --> 42:29.524
the – you’ll never find any smell there.

42:29.815 --> 42:32.166
Ha, but if human beings go and live there,

42:32.191 --> 42:36.173
then all smells start. But there is no smell.

42:36.269 --> 42:39.691
Nature looks after itself, it cleanses itself, it does everything.

42:40.191 --> 42:43.107
So for everything there’s a time, it must be done with

42:43.483 --> 42:44.773
a little leisure.

42:44.832 --> 42:47.124
I mean, once if you have to clean the house,

42:47.149 --> 42:48.832
so clean the house.

42:48.857 --> 42:50.249
But all the time if your attention is cleaning this,

42:50.274 --> 42:52.940
cleaning this, make this clean, put this right –

42:52.987 --> 42:59.399
you are good for nothing, you are like a Hoover machine!

43:00.399 --> 43:02.464
And who can love such a woman

43:02.649 --> 43:08.524
who’s just a Hoover machine all the time?

43:14.441 --> 43:18.899
But again as the, you know the Devi has the,

43:18.924 --> 43:22.304
all the extremes, so this is one extreme.

43:22.483 --> 43:27.024
And the another extreme is that absolutely lousiest people,

43:27.483 --> 43:29.483
that in England –

43:30.107 --> 43:32.733
absolutely lousy, very lousy.

43:33.232 --> 43:35.817
They can live with all kinds of lousiness,

43:35.842 --> 43:40.024
and that is going too far.

43:40.100 --> 43:44.024
So this is in between one has to be.

43:44.483 --> 43:48.773
Cleanliness is for us, we are not for cleanliness.

43:48.798 --> 43:52.691
You are not paid for that, you are not maid-servants.

43:52.837 --> 43:54.940
So cleanliness has to be there.

43:54.965 --> 43:56.688
We like it so we’ll make it clean,

43:56.733 --> 43:58.124
but it should not be that

43:58.149 --> 44:01.024
everybody should be panicked about it;

44:01.524 --> 44:05.957
to be in a situation that you have no time to talk to

44:05.982 --> 44:09.534
anyone, to be nice to anyone, also no time even

44:09.559 --> 44:11.815
to meditate.

44:11.815 --> 44:14.374
Even meditating they will be seeing round

44:14.399 --> 44:16.524
if something is falling here, “Oh my God!”

44:16.940 --> 44:18.773
and they will go and pick up.

44:18.798 --> 44:21.244
I wouldn’t be surprised that even in the church they

44:21.269 --> 44:22.186
start doing that!

44:22.973 --> 44:27.140
There’s no discipline of meditation,

44:28.733 --> 44:32.773
discipline of meditation, of divine work,

44:32.773 --> 44:38.733
discipline of following the will of God –

44:39.065 --> 44:41.191
that’s not there.

44:41.773 --> 44:44.065
Unless and that discipline comes many,

44:44.441 --> 44:48.191
what you are doing is something so mundane and stupid,

44:48.649 --> 44:54.773
useless wastage of your life, have no dignity for yourself.

44:55.107 --> 44:59.691
So now as Sahaja yogis we have to have that discipline

45:00.149 --> 45:02.608
of meditation.

45:03.024 --> 45:08.374
Then the Power, this Amba, She knows you so well:

45:08.399 --> 45:09.608
She knows your past,

45:09.864 --> 45:12.649
and She knows what sort of a person you are.

45:12.649 --> 45:16.207
Once you start introspecting

45:16.232 --> 45:18.149
and seeing it within yourself,

45:18.524 --> 45:21.274
“what is wrong with me?”

45:21.773 --> 45:25.583
and to reach that state of complete equilibrium,

45:25.608 --> 45:26.982
“what have I to do?” –

45:27.096 --> 45:31.316
is to first of all, you have to meditate.

45:31.982 --> 45:36.783
There is no way out, I must tell you, there is no way.

45:36.808 --> 45:38.691
Somebody said, “Mother, I have given up eating this,

45:38.716 --> 45:41.857
I have given up eating that” – nothing.

45:42.357 --> 45:46.274
“Mother, I do this and I stand on my head” – nothing.

45:46.899 --> 45:50.087
You must meditate, and the meditation

45:50.149 --> 45:52.357
should be little bit in the morning

45:52.691 --> 45:54.524
and little bit in the evening.

45:54.804 --> 45:58.430
And don’t see your watch when you are meditating.

46:02.774 --> 46:06.441
The time has to be kept for meditation, whatever it is.

46:06.546 --> 46:08.441
It takes hardly any time.

46:08.441 --> 46:10.374
I mean, even I have seen women take so much time

46:10.399 --> 46:14.082
to get ready that even one tenth of that time

46:14.107 --> 46:17.316
if you can give for your meditation,

46:17.452 --> 46:20.202
you will be, you’ll not need much make-up.

46:20.765 --> 46:24.317
Your skin will improve, your hair will improve, your face

46:24.342 --> 46:26.773
will improve, everything will work out.

46:26.982 --> 46:29.999
You don’t have to use anything, don’t have to use any

46:30.024 --> 46:33.207
perfumes or anything whatsoever,

46:33.232 --> 46:36.274
your body itself will be full of perfume.

46:36.733 --> 46:38.274
Everything will be supplied.

46:38.691 --> 46:42.608
So what we have to do is to first of all see

46:42.815 --> 46:46.065
a surrender to the will of the God.

46:46.399 --> 46:49.524
For Sahaja yogis it’s very important.

46:49.773 --> 46:52.733
Once you surrender, all your problems will be solved.

46:52.940 --> 46:55.107
You surrender your problems also.

46:55.399 --> 46:57.815
“I leave it to You. God, You solve the problem.

46:58.191 --> 47:01.774
You do this.”

47:02.232 --> 47:06.332
It is such a precise, such an effective,

47:06.357 --> 47:12.107
such an efficient Power.

47:13.149 --> 47:19.483
And above all it loves you, cares for you, it forgives you.

47:19.815 --> 47:21.531
Even if you make mistakes it forgives,

47:21.556 --> 47:23.024
“All right, it will be all right.”

47:23.049 --> 47:26.249
It is wanting you all to be properly seated

47:26.274 --> 47:31.024
in your thrones, enjoying your power.

47:31.524 --> 47:35.773
So whatever is needed is done with great care.

47:36.316 --> 47:40.232
So Navaratri is now the tenth day of Navaratri,

47:40.575 --> 47:43.191
which is the most important for all of you,

47:43.644 --> 47:50.566
is where this Paramchaitanya has become active.

47:51.024 --> 47:54.249
And by its activity you should know it is become

47:54.274 --> 47:55.791
very powerful,

47:55.910 --> 48:02.129
and that now anybody who tries to be nasty with you,

48:02.399 --> 48:06.149
tries to trouble you – “I don’t have to worry at all.”

48:06.733 --> 48:09.024
It will take care of it.

48:09.306 --> 48:12.608
All wrong things you have done,

48:12.868 --> 48:15.065
all bad karmas you have done,

48:15.379 --> 48:19.691
you will be rewarded for that, no doubt.

48:20.107 --> 48:22.357
But if you are a realized soul, finished;

48:22.774 --> 48:24.483
you are not on that level.

48:24.483 --> 48:27.416
Like we can say that ordinary people

48:27.441 --> 48:29.691
can be charged with criminality,

48:30.065 --> 48:34.316
but supposing you rise to a higher status of kinghood,

48:34.691 --> 48:36.857
then nobody can charge you.

48:37.357 --> 48:39.191
You are above the law.

48:39.267 --> 48:42.441
In the same way, it has happened with you that nobody

48:42.774 --> 48:46.583
can touch you, nobody can destroy you, and

48:46.608 --> 48:49.899
nobody can hamper your progress.

48:50.274 --> 48:54.024
Only it is you who can do it.

48:54.524 --> 48:56.399
And nobody can harm Me,

48:56.733 --> 48:59.624
no rakshasa can harm Me and has never done so.

48:59.649 --> 49:03.815
But it is you who can harm Me;

49:04.178 --> 49:08.733
because in this life I have taken you into My body,

49:08.873 --> 49:12.857
and I am working it out in My body,

49:12.882 --> 49:16.368
everything, your cleansing, everything,

49:16.440 --> 49:18.899
which is a difficult task.

49:18.924 --> 49:20.857
But in the beginning only,

49:21.149 --> 49:24.416
this Power went to Adam and Eve and told them that

49:24.441 --> 49:26.441
“you must have the Knowledge.”

49:26.441 --> 49:30.367
So that promise has to be fulfilled

49:30.441 --> 49:31.765
and that has to be done,

49:31.790 --> 49:33.839
though it’s a very hazardous task.

49:34.024 --> 49:36.944
Specially in the West I find it is very hazardous

49:37.107 --> 49:40.608
to make people understand

49:41.044 --> 49:45.357
that they are the part and parcel of the whole;

49:45.618 --> 49:47.774
it’s a very difficult task.

49:48.191 --> 49:49.608
They talk of big, big things.

49:50.065 --> 49:51.999
I have seen people write articles nowadays

49:52.024 --> 49:53.773
that nothing is substantial,

49:53.798 --> 49:59.790
this science is so limited, it has not solved our problem.

49:59.815 --> 50:02.649
All these big, big books they are writing.

50:02.913 --> 50:05.499
But if you write to them now that we have found out

50:05.524 --> 50:07.845
something, they don’t want to see you.

50:07.870 --> 50:09.524
They don’t want to meet you.

50:09.991 --> 50:11.595
They have nothing to do with it.

50:11.766 --> 50:14.039
So I don’t know what sort of seekers they are,

50:14.087 --> 50:18.222
with such a big ego balloon in front, and they are seekers.

50:18.566 --> 50:20.532
What are they seeking?

50:20.557 --> 50:23.499
The ego, the balloon – supposing you have a big balloon

50:23.524 --> 50:25.583
and you drop in the water, what will happen,

50:25.608 --> 50:28.274
the balloon will take here and there and there and here,

50:28.299 --> 50:30.899
you have no destination.

50:31.050 --> 50:34.624
In the same way they are without any destination,

50:34.649 --> 50:36.708
saying that “we are seeking, we are doing this,

50:36.733 --> 50:41.940
we are doing that” – without any destination,

50:42.049 --> 50:43.207
without any understanding,

50:43.232 --> 50:44.874
without any meaning to their life,

50:44.899 --> 50:46.773
absolutely useless people.

50:47.191 --> 50:48.691
They are worth nothing.

50:49.024 --> 50:51.124
We have to try as much as possible

50:51.149 --> 50:52.566
how many we can save;

50:52.654 --> 50:54.399
but those who do not want to come,

50:54.549 --> 50:57.483
there’s no need,

50:57.608 --> 50:59.191
there's no need for us.

50:59.524 --> 51:02.790
They have to ask for it, they have to humble down and

51:02.815 --> 51:05.583
they have to say that “We want to come to you” –

51:05.608 --> 51:06.982
then only we’ll have.

51:07.343 --> 51:09.416
I never write any letter to anyone,

51:09.441 --> 51:11.065
“Please come to My program.”

51:11.524 --> 51:13.832
All these gurus used to write to all the actors and

51:13.857 --> 51:17.649
musicians and all that; I never write.

51:17.982 --> 51:20.082
It’s just I am advertising Myself,

51:20.107 --> 51:22.316
if you want to come you can come.

51:22.649 --> 51:26.107
This advertisement also I was not willing.

51:27.899 --> 51:31.691
So you can imagine that

51:32.274 --> 51:38.274
we have now brought to the fruitfulness of the promise

51:38.691 --> 51:43.274
given long time back, that you will have the Knowledge.

51:43.773 --> 51:46.149
And you have the Knowledge.

51:46.453 --> 51:49.249
But with this Knowledge you should be identified,

51:49.274 --> 51:51.940
and you should know that you have this Knowledge,

51:51.974 --> 51:54.773
and that this Knowledge can be given to others.

51:55.053 --> 51:59.666
And we can transform this world into a beautiful world,

51:59.691 --> 52:03.774
and fulfill the vision of Adi Shakti.

52:04.566 --> 52:07.773
She created you for this purpose,

52:08.232 --> 52:11.207
brought you out from human level to the superhuman

52:11.232 --> 52:13.733
level for this purpose,

52:13.758 --> 52:16.357
and that is what you have to do it.

52:16.357 --> 52:22.790
And if you are today worshipping Me as the Jagadamba,

52:22.815 --> 52:24.065
then know that

52:24.090 --> 52:30.483
the Jagadamba itself is nothing else but Adi Shakti.

52:30.982 --> 52:36.357
And unless and until you people rise to that level

52:36.662 --> 52:39.608
of disciplining yourself in divine way –

52:39.633 --> 52:42.232
like some people are still smoking,

52:42.257 --> 52:45.583
“Oh, it’s all right, you know, we are ordinary people,

52:45.608 --> 52:47.608
we can’t do it.” All right, get out.

52:47.815 --> 52:51.773
Don’t worry about such people. They’ll be left behind,

52:52.149 --> 52:54.649
useless people, where will they go?

52:54.720 --> 52:57.399
They’ll be, I think, hanging in the limbo,

52:57.551 --> 53:01.691
because there isn’t much place now left even in the hell,

53:01.791 --> 53:04.107
so what is going to happen to them?

53:04.132 --> 53:05.832
But all this is available to you;

53:05.857 --> 53:07.166
only thing you must know

53:07.191 --> 53:10.857
how to control yourself, control your senses.

53:11.232 --> 53:14.774
In small, small things also we cannot control ourselves.

53:14.799 --> 53:17.601
If we cannot control our own horses,

53:17.626 --> 53:23.691
how can we reach that stage where we have to reach?

53:23.771 --> 53:27.024
So in all these small things don’t waste your energies.

53:27.170 --> 53:31.532
Just think, you have to meditate, you have to rise,

53:31.604 --> 53:34.649
and you have to give it to others.

53:34.845 --> 53:39.691
This is very much possible if you really love yourself.

53:40.107 --> 53:42.566
If you love yourself, then you have to understand that

53:42.901 --> 53:48.748
“See my body, see my mind, everything is given to me by

53:48.773 --> 53:51.483
God. How beautiful it is.

53:51.508 --> 53:55.207
And now it’s such a beautiful one, and it will be used by

53:55.232 --> 54:00.107
God for such a great purpose.”

54:00.483 --> 54:02.774
You are molded, you are made like that

54:03.232 --> 54:06.483
up to this point; but now it is your free will,

54:06.571 --> 54:10.773
and with this free will you have to rise.

54:11.065 --> 54:13.394
With this free will you have to understand

54:13.457 --> 54:19.399
what is to be done, and how to achieve that state.

54:20.566 --> 54:30.441
It is nature’s reaction to things.

54:30.673 --> 54:33.733
Always nature reacts to human beings.

54:33.941 --> 54:38.250
Nature has no free will but God reacts,

54:38.357 --> 54:40.899
and when the reaction of the God comes in

54:41.051 --> 54:44.399
then we find all these things happening.

54:44.424 --> 54:47.773
And I wish you could listen to My tape on Vishnumaya,

54:48.191 --> 54:52.708
which is very, very well explaining why all these

54:52.733 --> 54:57.815
calamities come, why people die of these calamities.

54:58.079 --> 55:01.470
It was a very good lecture, I hope you all will listen to it,

55:01.558 --> 55:04.191
and listen to it again and again.

55:04.287 --> 55:07.982
My lectures should not be just for nice one evening,

55:08.007 --> 55:10.608
but should be something you should try to understand.

55:10.633 --> 55:13.815
Now whatever I am saying is the truth,

55:13.840 --> 55:16.874
is the absolute truth and is a subtle thing,

55:16.899 --> 55:19.524
which none of them have said so far.

55:19.924 --> 55:21.998
Because you have got your realization,

55:22.157 --> 55:27.274
because you are Sahaja yogi, I can say this to you.

55:27.649 --> 55:36.399
May God bless you.
