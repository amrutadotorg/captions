1982-0712 Bhoomi Devi Puja Talk, Birmingham, UK

00:04.492 --> 00:07.904
Today I was telling Rustom

00:07.944 --> 00:11.696
that we should do of course the Puja of the Bhumi,

00:11.721 --> 00:16.472
because She’s angry actually,

00:16.579 --> 00:21.283
because She has produced such beautiful scenic beauty

00:21.347 --> 00:27.315
in this part of the country, and while the people who lived here

00:27.720 --> 00:31.008
have not understood the beauty that She has given them,

00:31.025 --> 00:33.679
and have tried to take to ugly

00:33.704 --> 00:38.735
and very sinful methods  of invoking

00:38.794 --> 00:41.810
the satanic and negative forces.

00:42.067 --> 00:44.618
And this has made Her very angry,

00:44.650 --> 00:47.871
I felt it the other day when we went out.

00:47.896 --> 00:56.371
And it is done through the ignorance of the people, no doubt,

00:56.784 --> 01:01.181
but still, some of them, even knowingly, are

01:01.349 --> 01:03.416
indulging into things like these.

01:04.019 --> 01:06.180
Is a very serious thing,

01:06.205 --> 01:08.969
because you are inviting,

01:08.994 --> 01:15.807
inviting the satanic forces to work out your destruction.

01:17.191 --> 01:20.157
These forces are never your friends, they’re destructive,

01:20.182 --> 01:22.173
they can never be your friends,

01:22.198 --> 01:25.293
because you came out of the construction of God,

01:25.320 --> 01:29.637
and they are the destructions, and they can never be your friends.

01:29.802 --> 01:34.431
So the nature has to be annoyed about it ,

01:34.559 --> 01:40.239
and they think that this country doesn’t deserve a puja.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.626
It is their own decision about it,

01:44.689 --> 01:48.297
that they are suggesting that this country doesn’t deserve…

01:48.352 --> 01:51.288
But I am thinking I don’t know what this country has done,

01:51.313 --> 01:57.649
this part of the country and that what I should do about them.

01:57.813 --> 02:01.721
To punish someone is very easy,

02:02.764 --> 02:06.576
and to get angry is even easier.

02:06.976 --> 02:15.165
But to have poise, and understanding, and compassion, is difficult.

02:17.073 --> 02:24.592
The patience of a mother they cannot have,

02:25.946 --> 02:28.489
it’s alright, I can understand them –

02:28.545 --> 02:31.187
but they have to obey.

02:31.349 --> 02:35.249
Something has to be done, has to be done.

02:35.457 --> 02:36.960
We have to work out.

02:37.040 --> 02:41.321
Even if I go to hell, I’ll have to work it out.

02:41.647 --> 02:43.295
That’s my job.

02:43.405 --> 02:50.047
That’s what all of them and you, all put together,
have to help me.

02:51.213 --> 02:56.994
Because all this anger, everything, will pass away.

02:57.314 --> 03:01.547
What will remain is the achievement,

03:01.754 --> 03:05.813
the achievement that we have

03:06.641 --> 03:12.247
accomplished by our perseverance and our patience.

03:13.449 --> 03:20.272
So once we realise the achievement

03:20.383 --> 03:23.037
and the importance of the achievement,

03:23.110 --> 03:26.339
we do not give way to these temporary moods

03:26.386 --> 03:33.491
we have to be absolutely tranquil and understanding about it.

03:37.111 --> 03:42.780
Also in this way we play into the hands of the negative forces,

03:43.085 --> 03:46.064
because they want to be disturbing,

03:46.116 --> 03:48.330
and we play into their hands in the anger.

03:48.361 --> 03:50.778
So actually, when we are angry, actually

03:50.818 --> 03:52.935
we are going against ourselves.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.589
You are playing into the hands of the negative.

03:55.974 --> 03:59.843
So what’s the use of getting angry and showing temper?

03:59.898 --> 04:06.411
It is addressed to these angry natural things that.

04:06.577 --> 04:12.608
Alright. Now, we should start our puja

04:12.805 --> 04:18.427
because I think we should start it
and it will settle down then with the puja.

04:20.745 --> 04:24.261
As it is, when I first came to England I said there is a big

04:24.431 --> 04:27.196
curse of the Goddess on this country.

04:27.251 --> 04:30.952
Really. That time the climate was just like this.

04:31.120 --> 04:35.963
And you could not even step out of your door.

04:36.387 --> 04:38.861
We were staying in Alwich, I remember.

04:38.956 --> 04:44.649
And the car was hardly about, say, ten feet,

04:44.745 --> 04:48.454
and we didn’t know how to reach the car, it was so windy.

04:48.502 --> 04:52.878
And we were wearing coats and everything, but everything was

04:53.016 --> 04:57.233
absolutely in a windy state.

04:57.291 --> 05:03.301
And then I said that this country is really
under the curse of the Goddess.

05:06.625 --> 05:13.406
But the one who curses also can take back the curse, isn’t it?

05:15.413 --> 05:20.562
But this is Vishnumaya, always very angry.
Actually she’s very, very angry person.

05:20.666 --> 05:28.591
When she gets angry, she tries to show her anger.

05:28.745 --> 05:32.381
So as it is, you know, it is part and parcel of me,

05:32.488 --> 05:35.847
but my own part and parcel suggests –

05:36.006 --> 05:39.474
like, supposing there’s something burning,

05:39.867 --> 05:42.456
and I put my foot on that.

05:42.657 --> 05:45.521
It suggests, my foot suggests me that this is hot,

05:45.577 --> 05:49.045
better not put your foot. It’s like that.

05:49.459 --> 05:53.062
So let us see how the puja works out today.

05:53.184 --> 05:55.392
It’s a great challenge to all of us.

05:55.443 --> 05:58.721
Let us do it with shraddha, don’t have ashraddha,

05:58.746 --> 06:01.434
then it will work out, I’m sure it will work out.

06:01.509 --> 06:05.614
You are my better children

06:05.805 --> 06:08.246
May God bless you.
