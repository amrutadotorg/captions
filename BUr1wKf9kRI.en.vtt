00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.904
1982-0712 Bhoomi Devi Puja Talk, Birmingham, UK

00:00:04.492 --> 00:00:07.904
Today I was telling Rustom

00:00:07.944 --> 00:00:11.696
that we should do of course the Puja of the Bhumi,

00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:16.472
because She’s angry actually,

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:21.283
because She has produced such beautiful scenic beauty

00:00:21.347 --> 00:00:27.315
in this part of the country, and while the people who lived here

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.008
have not understood the beauty that She has given them,

00:00:31.025 --> 00:00:33.679
and have tried to take to ugly

00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:38.735
and very sinful methods  of invoking

00:00:38.794 --> 00:00:41.810
the satanic and negative forces.

00:00:42.067 --> 00:00:44.618
And this has made Her very angry,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.871
I felt it the other day when we went out.

00:00:47.896 --> 00:00:56.371
And it is done through the ignorance of the people, no doubt,

00:00:56.784 --> 00:01:01.181
but still, some of them, even knowingly, are

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:03.416
indulging into things like these.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.180
Is a very serious thing,

00:01:06.205 --> 00:01:08.969
because you are inviting,

00:01:08.994 --> 00:01:15.807
inviting the satanic forces to work out your destruction.

00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:20.157
These forces are never your friends, they’re destructive,

00:01:20.182 --> 00:01:22.173
they can never be your friends,

00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:25.293
because you came out of the construction of God,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.637
and they are the destructions, and they can never be your friends.

00:01:29.802 --> 00:01:34.431
So the nature has to be annoyed about it ,

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:40.239
and they think that this country doesn’t deserve a puja.

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:44.626
It is their own decision about it,

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.297
that they are suggesting that this country doesn’t deserve…

00:01:48.352 --> 00:01:51.288
But I am thinking I don’t know what this country has done,

00:01:51.313 --> 00:01:57.649
this part of the country and that what I should do about them.

00:01:57.813 --> 00:02:01.721
To punish someone is very easy,

00:02:02.764 --> 00:02:06.576
and to get angry is even easier.

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:15.165
But to have poise, and understanding, and compassion, is difficult.

00:02:17.073 --> 00:02:24.592
The patience of a mother they cannot have,

00:02:25.946 --> 00:02:28.489
it’s alright, I can understand them –

00:02:28.545 --> 00:02:31.187
but they have to obey.

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.249
Something has to be done, has to be done.

00:02:35.457 --> 00:02:36.960
We have to work out.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.321
Even if I go to hell, I’ll have to work it out.

00:02:41.647 --> 00:02:43.295
That’s my job.

00:02:43.405 --> 00:02:50.047
That’s what all of them and you, all put together,
have to help me.

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:56.994
Because all this anger, everything, will pass away.

00:02:57.314 --> 00:03:01.547
What will remain is the achievement,

00:03:01.754 --> 00:03:05.813
the achievement that we have

00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:12.247
accomplished by our perseverance and our patience.

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:20.272
So once we realise the achievement

00:03:20.383 --> 00:03:23.037
and the importance of the achievement,

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.339
we do not give way to these temporary moods

00:03:26.386 --> 00:03:33.491
we have to be absolutely tranquil and understanding about it.

00:03:37.111 --> 00:03:42.780
Also in this way we play into the hands of the negative forces,

00:03:43.085 --> 00:03:46.064
because they want to be disturbing,

00:03:46.116 --> 00:03:48.330
and we play into their hands in the anger.

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:50.778
So actually, when we are angry, actually

00:03:50.818 --> 00:03:52.935
we are going against ourselves.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.589
You are playing into the hands of the negative.

00:03:55.974 --> 00:03:59.843
So what’s the use of getting angry and showing temper?

00:03:59.898 --> 00:04:06.411
It is addressed to these angry natural things that.

00:04:06.577 --> 00:04:12.608
Alright. Now, we should start our puja

00:04:12.805 --> 00:04:18.427
because I think we should start it
and it will settle down then with the puja.

00:04:20.745 --> 00:04:24.261
As it is, when I first came to England I said there is a big

00:04:24.431 --> 00:04:27.196
curse of the Goddess on this country.

00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:30.952
Really. That time the climate was just like this.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.963
And you could not even step out of your door.

00:04:36.387 --> 00:04:38.861
We were staying in Alwich, I remember.

00:04:38.956 --> 00:04:44.649
And the car was hardly about, say, ten feet,

00:04:44.745 --> 00:04:48.454
and we didn’t know how to reach the car, it was so windy.

00:04:48.502 --> 00:04:52.878
And we were wearing coats and everything, but everything was

00:04:53.016 --> 00:04:57.233
absolutely in a windy state.

00:04:57.291 --> 00:05:03.301
And then I said that this country is really
under the curse of the Goddess.

00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:13.406
But the one who curses also can take back the curse, isn’t it?

00:05:15.413 --> 00:05:20.562
But this is Vishnumaya, always very angry.
Actually she’s very, very angry person.

00:05:20.666 --> 00:05:28.591
When she gets angry, she tries to show her anger.

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:32.381
So as it is, you know, it is part and parcel of me,

00:05:32.488 --> 00:05:35.847
but my own part and parcel suggests –

00:05:36.006 --> 00:05:39.474
like, supposing there’s something burning,

00:05:39.867 --> 00:05:42.456
and I put my foot on that.

00:05:42.657 --> 00:05:45.521
It suggests, my foot suggests me that this is hot,

00:05:45.577 --> 00:05:49.045
better not put your foot. It’s like that.

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:53.062
So let us see how the puja works out today.

00:05:53.184 --> 00:05:55.392
It’s a great challenge to all of us.

00:05:55.443 --> 00:05:58.721
Let us do it with shraddha, don’t have ashraddha,

00:05:58.746 --> 00:06:01.434
then it will work out, I’m sure it will work out.

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:05.614
You are my better children

00:06:05.805 --> 00:06:08.246
May God bless you.
