57:42.174 --> 57:47.963
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

57:47.963 --> 58:05.974
At the very outset we have to know that the
truth cannot be manipulated, cannot be created,

58:05.974 --> 58:15.324
cannot be conceptualized by your mind or by
your imagination.

58:15.324 --> 58:24.464
It is what it is and has been and will be.

58:24.464 --> 58:32.573
So the truth is very simple.

58:32.573 --> 58:35.804
Very simple thing it is.

58:35.804 --> 58:58.673
But you have to have very scientific outlook
to keep your minds open because this the knowledge

58:58.673 --> 59:01.103
of the roots.

59:01.103 --> 59:08.054
What you see outside and what you know about
it is the knowledge about the tree.

59:08.054 --> 59:18.853
And should accept whatever I am saying as
a hypothesis and if it is proved then as honest

59:18.853 --> 59:23.034
people you have to accept it.

59:23.034 --> 59:38.104
The truth is very simple that all this universe,
this cosmos is looked after, is nourished,

59:38.104 --> 59:51.854
is guided by all pervading divine power which
is in Sanskrit language you can call it as

59:51.854 --> 01:00:00.914
paramachaitanya and in quran its called as
rooh.

01:00:00.914 --> 01:00:13.704
In every great scriptures it is described
as a formless energy that looks after guides

01:00:13.704 --> 01:00:32.304
everything that is living works out every
balance of this universe , of this earth.

01:00:32.304 --> 01:00:45.954
Only at the level of human awareness we have
freedom to choose because we have to rise

01:00:45.954 --> 01:00:54.704
to higher awareness of complete freedom.

01:00:54.704 --> 01:00:57.614
That is why we commit mistakes.

01:00:57.614 --> 01:00:59.344
Doesn’t matter.

01:00:59.344 --> 01:01:06.134
After all we are human being we are not Gods.

01:01:06.134 --> 01:01:13.984
So if we commit mistakes it makes it makes
no difference whatsoever for your ascent to

01:01:13.984 --> 01:01:16.214
that higher level.

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:29.414
And the higher level is the second truth that
you are not this body not this mind, not your

01:01:29.414 --> 01:01:35.524
ego nor your conditionings but you are pure
spirit.

01:01:35.524 --> 01:01:39.094
That is what you have to be.

01:01:39.094 --> 01:01:48.963
This can only work out through the living
process of evolutionary ascent .

01:01:48.963 --> 01:01:55.944
you have become a human being and now you
have to become a higher human being.

01:01:55.944 --> 01:02:04.444
As a human being you a develop a new kind
of awareness.

01:02:04.444 --> 01:02:11.893
On your central nervous system whatever we
have achieved in our evolution we feel it

01:02:11.893 --> 01:02:16.804
on our nervous system.

01:02:16.804 --> 01:02:22.913
Like if you take dog or a horse through a
place which is very filthy, dirty smelling

01:02:22.913 --> 01:02:28.244
it can pass through.

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:30.464
But human being cannot.

01:02:30.464 --> 01:02:35.004
human beings have the sense of the colour
of beauty of so many things they have achieved

01:02:35.004 --> 01:02:36.294
through their evolutionary process.

01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:45.494
But still the ascent is necessary because
we do not know the absolute.

01:02:45.494 --> 01:02:54.684
Whatever we know partially based on our experiences
and our mistakes.

01:02:54.684 --> 01:03:04.324
But sometimes we are so self opinionated that
we don’t want to say that we have done mistakes

01:03:04.324 --> 01:03:07.904
or not do we want to see that we want to seek
higher.

01:03:07.904 --> 01:03:14.284
But there are a category of people so many
of them which William Blakes has beautifully

01:03:14.284 --> 01:03:17.344
described as men seeking God.

01:03:17.344 --> 01:03:20.164
Its very simple.

01:03:20.164 --> 01:03:32.574
The people who are seeking the truth and these
are a special category who become sages.

01:03:32.574 --> 01:03:38.923
And these sages he says will have power to
make others the sages.

01:03:38.923 --> 01:03:45.744
?? Louis has described, all over the world
people have described about these great things

01:03:45.744 --> 01:03:50.693
going t happen in this modern times.

01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:56.794
Specially in India there was a pioneer or
this is the one who originated of astrology

01:03:56.794 --> 01:04:00.353
Bhrigumuni has written a book called nadi-granth.

01:04:00.353 --> 01:04:04.863
In which he has described sahaja yoga, very
clearly.

01:04:04.863 --> 01:04:13.723
And he has said that such a time will come
when people will get their realization sahaja.

01:04:13.723 --> 01:04:24.904
Saha mean with , ja means born; born with
you is the right united “yoga” with the

01:04:24.904 --> 01:04:25.904
divine.

01:04:25.904 --> 01:04:30.603
In modern yoga that we have got is a v bit
of a v bit.

01:04:30.603 --> 01:04:31.943
It has nothing to do with reality.

01:04:31.943 --> 01:04:39.804
To know the reality, to feel the all pervading
power is a right of every human being.

01:04:39.804 --> 01:04:41.823
That’s all is called yoga.

01:04:41.823 --> 01:04:47.684
And the another word another meaning of the
yoga is yukti meaning the depthness.

01:04:47.684 --> 01:05:07.784
The depthness to know to how to work out this
power and also to know the principles of divine

01:05:07.784 --> 01:05:09.694
powers.

01:05:09.694 --> 01:05:19.363
But that is not mentally is no t mentally,
it is on your nervous system.

01:05:19.363 --> 01:05:28.814
In the Buddhist philosophies is described
as bodha.

01:05:28.814 --> 01:05:36.753
Bodh doesn’t mean you feel it as a kind
of a think??.

01:05:36.753 --> 01:05:42.913
But, you feel it on your central nervous system.

01:05:42.913 --> 01:05:49.643
Its not a some sort of a sensationalisaton
but it is actulisation.

01:05:49.643 --> 01:05:51.283
That is bodha.

01:05:51.283 --> 01:05:53.733
Even the word vedas come from vida.

01:05:53.733 --> 01:05:57.094
Vida also means on the central nervous system.

01:05:57.094 --> 01:06:02.974
The reality is to be felt on our central nervous
system.

01:06:02.974 --> 01:06:13.424
Now we have here with us this mechanism built
in.

01:06:13.424 --> 01:06:15.674
in the bible its known as the tree of life.

01:06:15.674 --> 01:06:20.304
Kirshna has also described it as a tree of
life which is upside down.

01:06:20.304 --> 01:06:26.034
The roots of which are in the head.

01:06:26.034 --> 01:06:34.684
This is the tree of life described in most
of the scriptures in different names.

01:06:34.684 --> 01:06:40.664
Like in Tao, it refers to yangtze river as
tao.

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:49.354
That tao is nothing but this kundalini which
is the power which enlightens this tree of

01:06:49.354 --> 01:06:50.354
life.

01:06:50.354 --> 01:06:58.724
This kundalini is a power resides in the triangular
bone known as sacrum.

01:06:58.724 --> 01:07:02.114
Sacrum in latin language means sacred.

01:07:02.114 --> 01:07:07.864
That means the Greeks knew in ancient times
that this is a sacred bone which has something

01:07:07.864 --> 01:07:09.684
sacred in it.

01:07:09.684 --> 01:07:14.734
We all have this residual power within us
known as kundalini.

01:07:14.734 --> 01:07:22.344
Ofcourse in the modern times people have created
all kinds of myths about the kundalini saying

01:07:22.344 --> 01:07:23.344
it is very dangerous.

01:07:23.344 --> 01:07:24.344
One should not do this and all.

01:07:24.344 --> 01:07:25.344
Its all modern.

01:07:25.344 --> 01:07:34.274
But in the ancient books even upto the time
of Kabira they have all described it very

01:07:34.274 --> 01:07:36.824
clearly, no body has said it is dangerous.

01:07:36.824 --> 01:07:44.164
So may be some of the fake ones wanted to
create a fear because they didn’t want people

01:07:44.164 --> 01:07:45.164
to know the reality.

01:07:45.164 --> 01:07:51.224
The must have created this kind of a myth
saying that it is dangerous to awaken the

01:07:51.224 --> 01:07:52.224
kundalini.

01:07:52.224 --> 01:07:59.785
But this is the mother, your mother, your
individual mother who is going to give you

01:07:59.785 --> 01:08:01.694
your self-realization.

01:08:01.694 --> 01:08:08.104
As your mother has taken all the troubles,
labour problem upon herself; she takes all

01:08:08.104 --> 01:08:13.804
the problems you have and you get a very smooth
?? as self-realised souls.

01:08:13.804 --> 01:08:16.464
This has to happen.

01:08:16.464 --> 01:08:22.844
Because it is the vital, it is so vital that
it has to be easy.

01:08:22.844 --> 01:08:23.844
For eg.

01:08:23.844 --> 01:08:28.414
Our breathing if you had to go to the library
and read books and do all kinds of things,

01:08:28.414 --> 01:08:30.214
we would not have existed.

01:08:30.214 --> 01:08:35.804
In the same way it is such a vital thing that
this kundalini has to rise.

01:08:35.804 --> 01:08:43.414
Ofcourse, in the beginning of life this tree
of life had very few flowers.

01:08:43.414 --> 01:08:47.994
But gradually now I feel it’s a blossom
time.

01:08:47.994 --> 01:08:53.614
There are so many seekers who are seeking
the truth and it is working wonders.

01:08:53.614 --> 01:09:01.394
In a one day lecture, in a program like this
its very hard to explain everything about

01:09:01.394 --> 01:09:02.394
kundalini.

01:09:02.394 --> 01:09:12.084
As it is I must have spoken thousands of times
and then must be atleast 4000 tapes in English

01:09:12.084 --> 01:09:13.084
language alone.

01:09:13.084 --> 01:09:15.284
I have been working for 20 years to establish
sahaja yoga all over the world.

01:09:15.284 --> 01:09:22.564
And now there are 40 nations who have come
to sahaja yoga.

01:09:22.564 --> 01:09:30.434
And I must pay full respect to Russians whom
I found to be the best people for spirituality.

01:09:30.434 --> 01:09:33.354
The best people for spirituality.

01:09:33.354 --> 01:09:39.574
Whatever they might have been under, whatever
might have happened to them, one thing they

01:09:39.574 --> 01:09:41.704
didn’t waste the time much.

01:09:41.704 --> 01:09:48.374
They were all very well educated, very solid
sensible wise people.

01:09:48.374 --> 01:09:52.174
And the way they took to sahaja yoga I was
myself surprised.

01:09:52.174 --> 01:09:56.724
We just arrived there and there were thousands.

01:09:56.724 --> 01:10:03.054
And how did they managed to get their realization
so fast and establish it is really, even the

01:10:03.054 --> 01:10:06.374
Indians should feel ashamed of themselves.

01:10:06.374 --> 01:10:09.014
Because this is the heritage of India.

01:10:09.014 --> 01:10:11.654
This is the heritage of India.

01:10:11.654 --> 01:10:17.234
But we had 300 years the Britishers ruling
us perhaps so we have all become very westernized,

01:10:17.234 --> 01:10:18.234
perhaps.

01:10:18.234 --> 01:10:24.334
But I just don’t understand that how these
people who have never talked of God, religion;

01:10:24.334 --> 01:10:26.934
thank God for that also sometimes.

01:10:26.934 --> 01:10:31.244
Because religion is also now a days man made;
has conditioned people too much.

01:10:31.244 --> 01:10:35.364
And they had no such fake gurus there roaming
about.

01:10:35.364 --> 01:10:41.344
And they just jumped into it.

01:10:41.344 --> 01:10:47.514
Such a remarkable thing to see a country so
far away, kept away from all the theologies

01:10:47.514 --> 01:10:50.754
jumping into spirituality so fast.

01:10:50.754 --> 01:10:55.354
Even ofcourse in India we have lots of people
who are sahaja yogis all over I must admit

01:10:55.354 --> 01:10:57.894
because after all this is their heritage.

01:10:57.894 --> 01:11:06.616
And also in India we should say there are
3 doctors who have done MD in sahaja yoga,

01:11:06.616 --> 01:11:11.504
they have tried to prove that with sahaja
yoga means the kundalini awakening; you can

01:11:11.504 --> 01:11:14.034
get rid of psychosomatic diseases.

01:11:14.034 --> 01:11:16.454
You get better health.

01:11:16.454 --> 01:11:20.924
Also you can get epilepsy and all such mental
diseases cured.

01:11:20.924 --> 01:11:24.044
They have got MD for that.

01:11:24.044 --> 01:11:30.054
There are 7 doctors in London who are trying
to collect all the data about it and they

01:11:30.054 --> 01:11:32.304
also want to do their MDs.

01:11:32.304 --> 01:11:40.974
Also this in Cambridge university this gentleman
who is already a professor of philosophy is

01:11:40.974 --> 01:11:45.014
doing research on sahaja yoga.

01:11:45.014 --> 01:11:51.334
So, it is coming to the level of the intellectuals
and the scientists.

01:11:51.334 --> 01:11:57.794
But, scientists have to go little deeper if
they have to have to see any structure in

01:11:57.794 --> 01:11:59.714
a microscope.

01:11:59.714 --> 01:12:04.814
In the same way if we have to know about these
things, we have to have our self-realisation.

01:12:04.814 --> 01:12:09.004
Without our self realization we cannot understand
anyone.

01:12:09.004 --> 01:12:15.034
That’s what Kabira said, “what should
I do the whole world is blind, what should

01:12:15.034 --> 01:12:23.385
I tell them the whole world is deaf”; meaning
is that the level of understanding has not

01:12:23.385 --> 01:12:25.914
reached that subtle side.

01:12:25.914 --> 01:12:34.904
And that subtle side has to be ?? and that
is very simple now a days I have seen that

01:12:34.904 --> 01:12:37.584
people get realization without any difficulties.

01:12:37.584 --> 01:12:44.574
In Sydney, in Perth, in Brisbane, of all the
places in cairns I so surprised.

01:12:44.574 --> 01:12:49.974
Another surprise came from cairns which was
something just like Russia.

01:12:49.974 --> 01:12:52.744
Something out of the blue it exploded.

01:12:52.744 --> 01:12:58.434
Such beautiful people live there; So human,
so natural.

01:12:58.434 --> 01:13:08.544
I couldn’t understand how certain places
people are simple, not complicated, not conditioned

01:13:08.544 --> 01:13:10.204
and not arrogant.

01:13:10.204 --> 01:13:16.064
They have such a simplicity of understanding
and they just take to it so easily.

01:13:16.064 --> 01:13:21.734
Now, in Australia also we have lots of sahaja
yogis who are working it out.

01:13:21.734 --> 01:13:29.304
But in the earlier, early times we didn’t
have very good leaders who were I should say

01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:34.264
very well motivated towards sahaja yoga.

01:13:34.264 --> 01:13:36.244
And so it was going up and down.

01:13:36.244 --> 01:13:39.194
But now I hope it will be again re-established
here.

01:13:39.194 --> 01:13:44.494
But, one thing we should be very honest with
ourselves that if we have to have our benevolence,

01:13:44.494 --> 01:13:46.764
we have to honest ourselves.

01:13:46.764 --> 01:13:51.854
If you are enamored by somebody who claims
too much, talks too much and gives you big

01:13:51.854 --> 01:13:57.074
lectures and just says alright, take this
mantra or do this and do that, all kinds of

01:13:57.074 --> 01:14:03.864
nonsensical things; you first must go and
see the person who has been to him.

01:14:03.864 --> 01:14:07.504
What is he doing, what has he got.

01:14:07.504 --> 01:14:10.694
Has he got any spiritual power or not.

01:14:10.694 --> 01:14:17.444
Or just because he is going to that place
you must also go.

01:14:17.444 --> 01:14:24.094
Another problem in the west I find I must
say is the funny that they think that if something

01:14:24.094 --> 01:14:28.414
is free then it is nonsensical.

01:14:28.414 --> 01:14:30.304
This is very funny surprisingly.

01:14:30.304 --> 01:14:34.594
I went to Boston and they asked me how many
rolls royces you have.

01:14:34.594 --> 01:14:36.943
So people told she don’t take any money
how can she have rolls Royce.

01:14:36.943 --> 01:14:37.943
We are not interested.

01:14:37.943 --> 01:14:38.943
Its no business.

01:14:38.943 --> 01:14:40.544
I mean, God is not a business.

01:14:40.544 --> 01:14:44.064
And divinity is not a business.

01:14:44.064 --> 01:14:47.013
This we must understand that we can’t pay
for it.

01:14:47.013 --> 01:14:50.824
How much do we pay to the mother earth when
she produces all the beautiful things for

01:14:50.824 --> 01:14:51.824
us.

01:14:51.824 --> 01:14:55.353
In the same way how much are we going to pay
for our spirituality.

01:14:55.353 --> 01:14:56.353
Live alone anything.

01:14:56.353 --> 01:14:58.073
How much do you pay to Christ.

01:14:58.073 --> 01:15:03.524
On the contrary you sold him out.

01:15:03.524 --> 01:15:07.914
So this is simple thing of course Indians
understand better.

01:15:07.914 --> 01:15:13.284
But others also should understand that you
can’t pay for him.

01:15:13.284 --> 01:15:18.733
Anybody who asks money for this, you must
know is something very serious with it.

01:15:18.733 --> 01:15:26.274
If we I want you to take some money from you,
you wouldn’t because you are self respecting.

01:15:26.274 --> 01:15:30.134
The ones who takes money from you has no self
respect.

01:15:30.134 --> 01:15:34.603
You have retained him some sort of you are
retainers something like that.

01:15:34.603 --> 01:15:40.044
And one must understand this is a very important
very point for all western people to understand

01:15:40.044 --> 01:15:41.863
that you can’t pay for it.

01:15:41.863 --> 01:15:44.884
But sometimes I think it satisfies your ego
that you can purchase your guru.

01:15:44.884 --> 01:15:47.243
You can’t.

01:15:47.243 --> 01:15:51.444
if you can purchase your guru he can be your
servant, not your guru.

01:15:51.444 --> 01:15:57.243
This I want to make very clear to you because
this is not understood in the west because

01:15:57.243 --> 01:16:04.084
they are used to the systems where people
sell out or give money for everything.

01:16:04.084 --> 01:16:15.164
Now we have here, this systems which is very
interesting and is absolutely nicely put into

01:16:15.164 --> 01:16:17.554
our being.

01:16:17.554 --> 01:16:29.434
Below the kundalini, that is the triangular
bone; is the centre called as mooladhara chakra

01:16:29.434 --> 01:16:31.483
means the centre of mooladhara.

01:16:31.483 --> 01:16:35.724
Now mooladhara means the support of the roots.

01:16:35.724 --> 01:16:38.164
And the roots are the kundalini.

01:16:38.164 --> 01:16:45.914
The kundalini is in the 3 ½ coil that’s
why it is called as kundalini because coil

01:16:45.914 --> 01:16:47.084
means kundal.

01:16:47.084 --> 01:16:54.454
Now these, other centres are 6 above it.

01:16:54.454 --> 01:17:00.843
so one thing is sure that the last centre
does not come into play when the kundalini

01:17:00.843 --> 01:17:01.843
rises.

01:17:01.843 --> 01:17:08.323
So one should understand that all the functions
of the first centre which caters to our excretions

01:17:08.323 --> 01:17:13.564
inclusive of sex has nothing to with our ascent.

01:17:13.564 --> 01:17:18.233
So when kundalini starts rising these functions
just stop.

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:20.353
All these functions stop.

01:17:20.353 --> 01:17:26.573
First centre ?? into the yellow centre which
we call as swadhishthana.

01:17:26.573 --> 01:17:33.154
In a place like Canberra I think I better
talk about this centre.

01:17:33.154 --> 01:17:39.373
Because last year when I came swadhishthana
was here so caught up that my foot became

01:17:39.373 --> 01:17:41.503
paralysed with it.

01:17:41.503 --> 01:17:47.934
Now the swadhishthana centre you can see that
as got a ?? in it, yellow one.

01:17:47.934 --> 01:17:59.534
When we use it we work out the right side
channel which is the channel of the sun, which

01:17:59.534 --> 01:18:01.634
is for our future.

01:18:01.634 --> 01:18:10.354
And also it is for our mental and our physical
work.

01:18:10.354 --> 01:18:19.983
So when we think too much and we plan too
much for the future, which is of course the

01:18:19.983 --> 01:18:24.594
thing going on here, so this centre goes out
of ??.

01:18:24.594 --> 01:18:32.983
Like I would say there is another side to
it, is another one, which is we call as the

01:18:32.983 --> 01:18:43.054
channel for our emotion, for our desire and
the channel that looks after all our past.

01:18:43.054 --> 01:18:53.113
This is the centre what we call as the, this
is the channel as we call it as the channel

01:18:53.113 --> 01:19:00.914
of ida or is the channel of moon.

01:19:00.914 --> 01:19:06.213
So the right side looks after the right sympathetic
nervous system and the left side looks after

01:19:06.213 --> 01:19:08.233
the left sympathetic nervous system.

01:19:08.233 --> 01:19:15.344
And the central path is for our ascent which
also caters to our parasympathetic nervous

01:19:15.344 --> 01:19:16.344
system.

01:19:16.344 --> 01:19:22.234
That is we can understand it this way that
if we run fast our heart beat increases.

01:19:22.234 --> 01:19:24.154
So it means the emergency.

01:19:24.154 --> 01:19:31.194
For all emergencies the sympathetic nervous
system goes into action and when it goes into

01:19:31.194 --> 01:19:39.294
action then only the para sympathetic, central
path reduces, brings it to normal.

01:19:39.294 --> 01:19:40.424
That we can’t do.

01:19:40.424 --> 01:19:44.794
We can only play about with the left or the
right sympathetic system.

01:19:44.794 --> 01:19:48.054
That means we can only go to the left side
or to the right side.

01:19:48.054 --> 01:19:53.144
That means we can only go to our past or to
our future.

01:19:53.144 --> 01:19:59.434
But we cannot be in the present.

01:19:59.434 --> 01:20:04.833
we cannot be in the present.

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:12.664
And absolute can only be known in the present
because that’s reality.

01:20:12.664 --> 01:20:16.304
The past is finished, the future doesn’t
exists.

01:20:16.304 --> 01:20:20.103
Reality is when you are the present.

01:20:20.103 --> 01:20:21.603
But how to be in the present.

01:20:21.603 --> 01:20:22.603
That’s the problem.

01:20:22.603 --> 01:20:26.943
For a thought rises and falls, another thought
rises and falls.

01:20:26.943 --> 01:20:31.284
We are jumping on the cusp of the thoughts.

01:20:31.284 --> 01:20:37.623
But we cannot achieve that state where we
are in the present and that’s why we go

01:20:37.623 --> 01:20:39.583
into tensions, we go into problems.

01:20:39.583 --> 01:20:44.654
I will show you here like this is the centre;
and on the left and the right side there’s

01:20:44.654 --> 01:20:45.654
the energy moving.

01:20:45.654 --> 01:20:51.274
Supposing you go too much on the right or
too much on the left, there’s a movement

01:20:51.274 --> 01:20:58.794
going on and there’s a constriction, in
the constriction, in the centre, in the ?? centre.

01:20:58.794 --> 01:21:04.184
But apart from this constriction the energy
is exhausted.

01:21:04.184 --> 01:21:09.623
If the energy is too much exhausted and say
its moving on the right and there is something

01:21:09.623 --> 01:21:14.113
happens on the left side, something emotional,
something some accident or some shock; immediately

01:21:14.113 --> 01:21:23.514
it looses this balance and as a result you
develop a disease which we call as psychosomatic

01:21:23.514 --> 01:21:30.394
that includes all your ?? diseases where the
degeneration of muscles takes place.

01:21:30.394 --> 01:21:37.233
Also it includes your cancer, blood cancer
all sort of these psychosomatic diseases which

01:21:37.233 --> 01:21:39.054
are incurable.

01:21:39.054 --> 01:21:46.034
So when the kundalini rises she passes through
this and this and sort of as if a thread is

01:21:46.034 --> 01:21:56.853
pass through and it all gets absolutely in
connection with the whole.

01:21:56.853 --> 01:22:00.884
So there cannot be any malignancy because
the connection is established.

01:22:00.884 --> 01:22:04.554
And also also she nourishes that centre.

01:22:04.554 --> 01:22:10.473
As that nourishment takes place, the person
gets alright and he feels perfect.

01:22:10.473 --> 01:22:12.733
This is how sahaja yoga works.

01:22:12.733 --> 01:22:18.563
So it is your own energy within you, it is
your own property within you; when it rises

01:22:18.563 --> 01:22:22.304
it gives you that power that you get cured.

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:26.664
But when it is connected with the mains with
all pervading power.

01:22:26.664 --> 01:22:30.203
Its all the time flowing through you.

01:22:30.203 --> 01:22:36.473
So even if there is any imbalance, it brings
you to balance.

01:22:36.473 --> 01:22:41.843
Suddenly you also feel all this in, all pervading
power on your finger tips.

01:22:41.843 --> 01:22:47.774
In the Quran there is one beautiful sura called
“sajda yoga”.

01:22:47.774 --> 01:22:54.873
In that they have described all about it that
your hands will speak and the time of resurrection

01:22:54.873 --> 01:22:57.894
and they will give witness against you.

01:22:57.894 --> 01:23:03.714
So now we will today discuss one centre which
is very important for all of you I think because

01:23:03.714 --> 01:23:08.613
you are all working in the government and
I know what government services.

01:23:08.613 --> 01:23:15.394
Because my husband has been all his life the
government service and later on he was with

01:23:15.394 --> 01:23:16.394
the UN.

01:23:16.394 --> 01:23:19.814
So I know what it means and what happens to
them .

01:23:19.814 --> 01:23:28.373
now this centre swadhishthana, as I told you,
caters for physical and mental activities,

01:23:28.373 --> 01:23:29.373
functions.

01:23:29.373 --> 01:23:39.934
Now the physical activity may be less, but
the most important function of this centre

01:23:39.934 --> 01:23:44.483
is to convert the fat cells for the use of
the brain.

01:23:44.483 --> 01:23:51.044
When we think too much then our grey cells
are used and they are to be replaced.

01:23:51.044 --> 01:23:57.634
So this replacement takes place through the
function of this centre which transforms ordinary

01:23:57.634 --> 01:24:02.514
fat cells for the use of the brain.

01:24:02.514 --> 01:24:12.024
But it has some other functions also to be
done, which are subsidiary but are very important.

01:24:12.024 --> 01:24:20.223
So it looks after your liver, it looks after
your pancreas, it looks after your spleen,

01:24:20.223 --> 01:24:26.024
it looks after your kidney and part of your
intestines.

01:24:26.024 --> 01:24:37.264
Now, if we make this centre work so hard it
neglects other important functions.

01:24:37.264 --> 01:24:40.753
So first it neglects is the liver.

01:24:40.753 --> 01:24:48.223
And the function of the liver is to absorb
the poison of the body as heat into itself

01:24:48.223 --> 01:24:52.323
and release it into the blood stream.

01:24:52.323 --> 01:25:02.044
But once this centre neglects and doesn’t
give energy to liver, the heat in the body

01:25:02.044 --> 01:25:05.753
remains as it is and it starts rising on the
right side.

01:25:05.753 --> 01:25:11.443
when it starts rising on the right side it
gives you diseases like asthama because you

01:25:11.443 --> 01:25:15.363
have another centre called right heart.

01:25:15.363 --> 01:25:17.813
It can also give you a massive heart attack.

01:25:17.813 --> 01:25:22.223
People don’t know its all due to liver trouble.

01:25:22.223 --> 01:25:31.764
But some how if this liver is clicked by movement
of the left side then one can get all kinds

01:25:31.764 --> 01:25:35.314
of allergies and all kinds of problems which
are skin troubles.

01:25:35.314 --> 01:25:44.134
So when we sit in the sun, it is not the sun
that spoils our skins but it is the liver

01:25:44.134 --> 01:25:52.634
which gets heated up and can’t bear anymore
of that and that’s how you get your skin

01:25:52.634 --> 01:25:54.834
diseases like skin cancer.

01:25:54.834 --> 01:26:00.853
Then the second very important it has to look
after is your pancreas.

01:26:00.853 --> 01:26:11.373
Function of the pancreas is to dissolve the
sugar for use of the body and give to the

01:26:11.373 --> 01:26:18.073
other organs; supply the energy for it because
it has the carbohydrates in it.

01:26:18.073 --> 01:26:24.973
But when this centre is so much looking after
one side of transforming ordinary fat cells

01:26:24.973 --> 01:26:32.544
into grey cells, again they neglect, creates
a problem and you develop a horrible disease

01:26:32.544 --> 01:26:33.804
called diabetes.

01:26:33.804 --> 01:26:46.654
Now if you go the villages of India you will
be surprised when they make tea, the cup contain

01:26:46.654 --> 01:26:51.203
so much of sugar that a spoon has to stand
at right angle.

01:26:51.203 --> 01:26:52.583
Thats the measure.

01:26:52.583 --> 01:26:56.154
Otherwise its not tea, its not good.

01:26:56.154 --> 01:26:59.884
And they take such a lot of sugar they never
get diabetes.

01:26:59.884 --> 01:27:03.274
They never get diabetes because they don’t
think.

01:27:03.274 --> 01:27:10.154
They just live nicely, earn for the day, sleep
off, we will see tomorrow.

01:27:10.154 --> 01:27:15.603
But those people who are sedentary, who are
working hard, thinking too much, futuristic

01:27:15.603 --> 01:27:20.193
planning; make their centre work only for
that purpose, really go against themselves

01:27:20.193 --> 01:27:22.873
and get this horrible disease called diabetes.

01:27:22.873 --> 01:27:31.304
Which is ofcourse curable if the kundalini
is there to help you.

01:27:31.304 --> 01:27:38.463
Then the third is even a worst one which is
coming from your spleen.

01:27:38.463 --> 01:27:44.593
Now spleen is your speedometer or we say it
is the one that keeps the rhythm of life.

01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:50.603
But in this modern times you have lost the
rhythm of life and all the time we are under

01:27:50.603 --> 01:27:53.024
shock, something is happening.

01:27:53.024 --> 01:28:01.394
So much so without sensationalisation we do
not feel any, any existence of our own.

01:28:01.394 --> 01:28:09.213
Like early in the morning you will get up,
first you will read the news paper.

01:28:09.213 --> 01:28:12.253
News paper means what; its a shock.

01:28:12.253 --> 01:28:15.843
Somebody died, somebody killed, some mishaps
n now its a hail storm, this and that something

01:28:15.843 --> 01:28:16.843
is there.

01:28:16.843 --> 01:28:19.063
With shocks you get worried.

01:28:19.063 --> 01:28:22.233
May be some of your relations are killed;
what has happened.

01:28:22.233 --> 01:28:29.103
So the first thing the spleen goes into the
jeopardy because the spleen has to supply

01:28:29.103 --> 01:28:31.884
red blood carpuscles at the emergency of like
this.

01:28:31.884 --> 01:28:34.723
And the second shock is may be jam on the
way.

01:28:34.723 --> 01:28:36.243
We are time bound.

01:28:36.243 --> 01:28:40.873
If the time is there we must reach in time,
and if you don’t reach in time as if you

01:28:40.873 --> 01:28:45.884
are going to be hanged or there is a already
and order coming from death coming to our

01:28:45.884 --> 01:28:47.824
?? ; that shaking conditions we live.

01:28:47.824 --> 01:28:55.173
All the time under tense conditions that we
must keep to time, we must keep to these norms,

01:28:55.173 --> 01:29:00.014
must do this; and the modern life has made
our life so artificial so artificial, that,

01:29:00.014 --> 01:29:03.233
supposing you are eating your food.

01:29:03.233 --> 01:29:06.644
Now you must keep your spoon and fork in a
way.

01:29:06.644 --> 01:29:08.603
I mean God has not told you that.

01:29:08.603 --> 01:29:15.804
But its something sort of a norm that we must
have a fork and spoon like that.

01:29:15.804 --> 01:29:18.384
Now, if you have not kept it then everybody
laugh at you.

01:29:18.384 --> 01:29:21.743
So by chance if you have not kept it you are
in trouble.

01:29:21.743 --> 01:29:26.634
Small small things absolutely good for nothing,
have covered our being as good as behaviour

01:29:26.634 --> 01:29:34.164
as something very posh as something very…
I don’t what they will say.

01:29:34.164 --> 01:29:39.123
But french will say something, english will
say something and everybody has a different

01:29:39.123 --> 01:29:40.123
style.

01:29:40.123 --> 01:29:45.223
And if you do not cope with it then you are
absolutely a rustic person, you have no manners,

01:29:45.223 --> 01:29:46.223
nothing.

01:29:46.223 --> 01:29:49.924
You can pass dirty jokes, you can say all
dirty things, doesn’t matter that doesn’t

01:29:49.924 --> 01:29:51.603
matter… thats all right.

01:29:51.603 --> 01:29:58.093
You can drink as much as u like , you can
fall on the table doesn’t matter after all

01:29:58.093 --> 01:29:59.853
he was drunk so excused.

01:29:59.853 --> 01:30:00.853
See.

01:30:00.853 --> 01:30:05.464
But if you all do nonsensical things you are
a gone case.

01:30:05.464 --> 01:30:07.514
All these things way upon us.

01:30:07.514 --> 01:30:11.703
Now we have to dress up like this, we have
to be like that, if you don’t dress up like

01:30:11.703 --> 01:30:13.313
that its out fashion .

01:30:13.313 --> 01:30:18.353
We do not know in subtle ways that we are
playing into the hands of these entrepreneurs,

01:30:18.353 --> 01:30:20.034
just befooling us all the time.

01:30:20.034 --> 01:30:26.003
And thats how this tension, what to dress
what not to dress, you have to be formal or

01:30:26.003 --> 01:30:29.183
informal, what to do what to eat, how to call.

01:30:29.183 --> 01:30:34.524
Even to have rapport with someone is not,
u see, you cannot talk to someone at the same

01:30:34.524 --> 01:30:36.683
level as human being.

01:30:36.683 --> 01:30:38.943
On the contrary we think twice what should
I say.

01:30:38.943 --> 01:30:46.713
We will rehearse it at home and then we face
the person and we go completely in mess because

01:30:46.713 --> 01:30:48.973
we think no I can’t say that.

01:30:48.973 --> 01:30:50.593
We start on something else.

01:30:50.593 --> 01:30:56.563
There is no relaxed personality and we always
say I am not relaxed, I am tensed.

01:30:56.563 --> 01:30:57.563
But why.

01:30:57.563 --> 01:30:58.563
Animals are not tensed.

01:30:58.563 --> 01:30:59.634
They live in the same city.

01:30:59.634 --> 01:31:00.803
Nobody seems to be tensed.

01:31:00.803 --> 01:31:02.593
Trees are not tensed.

01:31:02.593 --> 01:31:04.233
Why are human beings tensed.

01:31:04.233 --> 01:31:10.813
Because they themselves have made these kind
of funny cages for themselves and they think

01:31:10.813 --> 01:31:13.853
that this is important to me like that.

01:31:13.853 --> 01:31:22.134
So all this leads to lots of shocks for our
speedometer which is a poor instrument for

01:31:22.134 --> 01:31:27.613
such a person which can’t understand and
becomes crazy.

01:31:27.613 --> 01:31:32.664
And when it is crazy it becomes vulnerable
and then you get a very serious disease called

01:31:32.664 --> 01:31:33.664
as blood cancer.

01:31:33.664 --> 01:31:44.654
You will be surprised that sahaja yoga has
cured blood cancer of many people.

01:31:44.654 --> 01:31:50.063
Not only that but those who are certified
thats all doctors do in blood cancer, to die

01:31:50.063 --> 01:31:56.384
within 10 days or 1 month are still there
after 5-6 years and doing very well.

01:31:56.384 --> 01:32:02.924
The reason is this spleen becomes good shock
absorber.

01:32:02.924 --> 01:32:05.733
Why that I will tell you later on.

01:32:05.733 --> 01:32:08.214
Now also you get your blood pressure.

01:32:08.214 --> 01:32:13.373
because of this your kidneys are affected,
your intestine goes out, so you will ?? to

01:32:13.373 --> 01:32:14.464
constipation the thing.

01:32:14.464 --> 01:32:23.004
So all these troubles come out of one that
we think too much.

01:32:23.004 --> 01:32:25.793
Now thinking cannot be stopped.

01:32:25.793 --> 01:32:27.394
Thats troubles.

01:32:27.394 --> 01:32:29.894
Thinking is coming all the time invading us.

01:32:29.894 --> 01:32:32.854
You can’t stop thinking.

01:32:32.854 --> 01:32:35.364
What should we do to stop thinking.

01:32:35.364 --> 01:32:42.974
For that if the kundalini rises you reach
a state, state of mind where you are thoughtlessly

01:32:42.974 --> 01:32:43.974
aware.

01:32:43.974 --> 01:32:44.974
There is not thought.

01:32:44.974 --> 01:32:48.313
You are aware absolutely aware but no thought.

01:32:48.313 --> 01:32:52.874
If you want to think you will think otherwise
you wouldn’t think just you wouldn’t think.

01:32:52.874 --> 01:32:54.974
And you are in that state.

01:32:54.974 --> 01:33:01.594
That state in sanskrit is called as nirvichar
samadhi which instantly takes place and the

01:33:01.594 --> 01:33:05.874
second stage you see we call is nirvikalpa
samadhi is doubtless awareness.

01:33:05.874 --> 01:33:07.914
Where you become absolutely detached.

01:33:07.914 --> 01:33:14.513
Like you are in the water you are afraid of
water.

01:33:14.513 --> 01:33:20.624
But suppose you get into the boat you can
watch the water alrigh, quiet relaxed.

01:33:20.624 --> 01:33:24.994
But supposing you know how to swim you can
jump in the water and save people who are

01:33:24.994 --> 01:33:26.144
getting drowned.

01:33:26.144 --> 01:33:30.856
In the same way when that state comes in where
you can jump and save other people and help

01:33:30.856 --> 01:33:38.474
other people then that state is called as
a state of doubtless awareness.

01:33:38.474 --> 01:33:46.043
With this a person becomes extremely extremely
powerful, dynamic.

01:33:46.043 --> 01:33:53.944
At the same time such a person becomes extremely
compassionate extremely compassionate.

01:33:53.944 --> 01:34:03.553
He bcomes a person who sees everything witness
everything as a drama.

01:34:03.553 --> 01:34:06.664
He gets out of it and sees everything as a
drama.

01:34:06.664 --> 01:34:12.954
He doesn’t get involved into problems but
he can see his problems clearly by which he

01:34:12.954 --> 01:34:15.374
can solve them better.

01:34:15.374 --> 01:34:22.394
And such a person then becomes a very good
human being because he becomes righteous.

01:34:22.394 --> 01:34:28.063
The are you see above that is the green area
is the area where our valencies are.

01:34:28.063 --> 01:34:29.644
Which are 10 valencies.

01:34:29.644 --> 01:34:35.224
Carbon has 4 we have 10 valencies and they
get enlightened.

01:34:35.224 --> 01:34:40.334
They get enlightened and that is what is innate
within us.

01:34:40.334 --> 01:34:45.964
Like carbon has 4 religions, in the same way
within us aer the 10 religions which are called

01:34:45.964 --> 01:34:51.644
in sanskrit as dharma, dharma eti sa dharma
the one we sustain within us is the dharma.

01:34:51.644 --> 01:34:56.694
Not that we practice say something and practice
something is not dharma is not dharma not

01:34:56.694 --> 01:34:57.694
religion.

01:34:57.694 --> 01:35:02.584
The one we sustain within us and this sustenance
takes place when the kundalini rises she enlightens

01:35:02.584 --> 01:35:06.124
that p?? and such a person becomes righteous
absolutely righteous.

01:35:06.124 --> 01:35:10.803
He is not bothered as to what others are doing.

01:35:10.803 --> 01:35:18.134
He lives with his own righteousness, enjoys
it, he enjoys his virtues and he sees the

01:35:18.134 --> 01:35:19.664
good point in others.

01:35:19.664 --> 01:35:26.983
Somehow or the other by his temperament and
nature and his magnetic personality he attracts

01:35:26.983 --> 01:35:32.184
others and tries to transform them only by
his existence.

01:35:32.184 --> 01:35:39.094
Now christ was a very subtle deity I should
say ?? subtle incarnation because he has said

01:35:39.094 --> 01:35:42.724
though shall not have adulterous eyes.

01:35:42.724 --> 01:35:45.964
though shall not have adulterous eyes.

01:35:45.964 --> 01:35:52.384
Now I would like to know in what christian
nation I should find such a people.

01:35:52.384 --> 01:35:59.273
Even the eyes because when you become realised
then you will be surprised your innocence

01:35:59.273 --> 01:36:00.273
comes back.

01:36:00.273 --> 01:36:02.544
Eyes become absolutely still.

01:36:02.544 --> 01:36:11.114
And such person when he develops further,
his even a glance of such a person can do

01:36:11.114 --> 01:36:14.184
wonders because there is no lust, no greed.

01:36:14.184 --> 01:36:15.824
You just watch.

01:36:15.824 --> 01:36:18.553
And watching something is the biggest boon.

01:36:18.553 --> 01:36:24.384
Suppose I see something beautiful and then
I react as a human being I am to react.

01:36:24.384 --> 01:36:30.694
So it is in my mind “oh God it will get
dirty and it is not insured or something sort

01:36:30.694 --> 01:36:31.734
of a nonsensical.

01:36:31.734 --> 01:36:37.993
Supposing it belongs to somebody then I start
thinking how much she must have paid and where

01:36:37.993 --> 01:36:39.664
should I get it.

01:36:39.664 --> 01:36:42.174
All this thoughts come to us.

01:36:42.174 --> 01:36:49.404
But supposing I am just watching it then what
happens like a lake which has no ripples in

01:36:49.404 --> 01:36:53.224
it; the whole creation reflects into it.

01:36:53.224 --> 01:37:01.144
In the same way the joy of creation starts
pouring on you and you feel relax and happy.

01:37:01.144 --> 01:37:03.324
You never feel your age.

01:37:03.324 --> 01:37:05.474
You never feel you are travelling.

01:37:05.474 --> 01:37:08.364
You are with yourself wherever you are.

01:37:08.364 --> 01:37:13.954
So all these problems we have in modern times,
speediness vanishes.

01:37:13.954 --> 01:37:19.303
Not only that but your family life will improves.

01:37:19.303 --> 01:37:20.344
Your society improves.

01:37:20.344 --> 01:37:21.344
Your country improves.

01:37:21.344 --> 01:37:23.424
Its a benevolence of the whole humanity you
can achieve.

01:37:23.424 --> 01:37:25.694
This transformation is very essential.

01:37:25.694 --> 01:37:35.204
I am very happy that the Russian in all western
world have taken such a strong step forward.

01:37:35.204 --> 01:37:45.434
I know all others will also now little bit
think about it that why, why not we? Why not

01:37:45.434 --> 01:37:47.054
we seek our benevolence.

01:37:47.054 --> 01:37:48.424
Why not we have this.

01:37:48.424 --> 01:37:51.684
When it is our own power why shouldn’t we
get it.

01:37:51.684 --> 01:37:54.723
Supposing I say there is a diamond available
here, free.

01:37:54.723 --> 01:38:01.043
Then not only from America but even from Greenland
people will come here.

01:38:01.043 --> 01:38:07.174
And I say there is a diamond within you, spirit,
why not have it and for nothing at all you

01:38:07.174 --> 01:38:08.364
just get it free.

01:38:08.364 --> 01:38:10.324
So why not have.

01:38:10.324 --> 01:38:16.053
This is what should be the attitude of all
the people.

01:38:16.053 --> 01:38:20.783
All over the world, but I think there are
certain conditionings which do not help people

01:38:20.783 --> 01:38:23.223
to get to that point.

01:38:23.223 --> 01:38:28.344
So we must know we have not achieved it so
far so why not achieve it further.

01:38:28.344 --> 01:38:32.954
If we haven’t got it why not we do it.

01:38:32.954 --> 01:38:37.324
Its a times, special time.

01:38:37.324 --> 01:38:42.614
And you should not missed out.

01:38:42.614 --> 01:38:51.104
Not only, not only the people in Russia but
even the government has helped us a lot.

01:38:51.104 --> 01:38:56.144
I am quiet amazed at the wisdom of these people.

01:38:56.144 --> 01:39:01.033
I do not know what I should give the credit.

01:39:01.033 --> 01:39:03.444
They are remarkable people I must say.

01:39:03.444 --> 01:39:08.944
And a day may come it might become the most
powerful, the most powerful country in the

01:39:08.944 --> 01:39:11.144
world.

01:39:11.144 --> 01:39:15.594
I am really amazed way they have developed
within themselves the depth.

01:39:15.594 --> 01:39:23.364
There was one fellow who gave me a book which
he has written about the mathematical calculation

01:39:23.364 --> 01:39:24.364
of Shree Chakra.

01:39:24.364 --> 01:39:29.714
In India there are very few must be knowing
what Shree Chakra is.

01:39:29.714 --> 01:39:32.904
Its very surprising.

01:39:32.904 --> 01:39:41.924
And this is what I am telling you here in
Australia which you must take note no doubt.

01:39:41.924 --> 01:39:50.194
Ofcourse now your government has done one
thing is to send some people to tape, video

01:39:50.194 --> 01:39:56.774
tape me and find out, go to Russia to find
out how Russians have got it , why we haven’t

01:39:56.774 --> 01:39:57.774
got it.

01:39:57.774 --> 01:40:02.144
So in this competition may be might start
working here everywhere else.

01:40:02.144 --> 01:40:04.914
But this wisdom, wisdom is needed.

01:40:04.914 --> 01:40:05.914
What are we doing about our life.

01:40:05.914 --> 01:40:08.154
What are we doing about it we should find
out.

01:40:08.154 --> 01:40:11.493
Where are we spending our time.

01:40:11.493 --> 01:40:13.904
Why are we going to miss it.

01:40:13.904 --> 01:40:15.714
Once you get into some terrible disease then
you will come to me.

01:40:15.714 --> 01:40:16.714
Whats the use.

01:40:16.714 --> 01:40:25.144
You will be happy to know we have cured one
gentleman here of aids no doubt.

01:40:25.144 --> 01:40:26.303
He ?? mr.

01:40:26.303 --> 01:40:27.303
??.

01:40:27.303 --> 01:40:28.303
but he had no will power.

01:40:28.303 --> 01:40:35.043
He went back to the same nonsensical habit
next day and then now he is dead.

01:40:35.043 --> 01:40:38.124
But the other day in Perth two people a husband
and wife got cured of aids.

01:40:38.124 --> 01:40:40.043
So I have hope about that also.

01:40:40.043 --> 01:40:46.543
We should have will power to do little bit
of practice of sahaja yoga and keep to it,

01:40:46.543 --> 01:40:47.543
develop it.

01:40:47.543 --> 01:40:52.184
I am sure they will live much longer than
that is expected.

01:40:52.184 --> 01:40:53.303
So may God bless you.

01:40:53.303 --> 01:40:57.664
In this short time whatever is possible I
have tried to put before you.

01:40:57.664 --> 01:41:03.803
I would ofcourse like you to ask me some questions
for few minutes and then we should have this

01:41:03.803 --> 01:41:05.714
experience of self realisation.

01:41:05.714 --> 01:41:08.983
That is very important than any of our questions.

01:41:08.983 --> 01:41:12.194
Because even, I am good at answering questions.

01:41:12.194 --> 01:41:15.904
And even if I answer all your questions has
no meaning because it doesn’t guarantee

01:41:15.904 --> 01:41:17.644
your ascent.

01:41:17.644 --> 01:41:23.094
What guarantees your ascent is the happening,
is the becoming.

01:41:23.094 --> 01:41:27.154
Unless and until that happens everything else
is useless.

01:41:27.154 --> 01:41:35.973
So its not a mental feel, its more a natural
growth within you of that new awareness which

01:41:35.973 --> 01:41:39.793
we call as collective consciousness.

01:41:39.793 --> 01:41:42.684
collective consciousness.

01:41:42.684 --> 01:41:48.824
That becomes part and parcel of you that you
can on your fingertips you can feel the five,

01:41:48.824 --> 01:41:53.803
six and seven centres on your left and five,
six and seven centres on the right.

01:41:53.803 --> 01:41:57.043
Your own and that of others.

01:41:57.043 --> 01:42:02.364
So there is self realisation and also you
have the power of collective consciousness.

01:42:02.364 --> 01:42:05.983
Now even if you know within one months time
you will find out.

01:42:05.983 --> 01:42:10.144
With in one months time , that what things
are decoding.

01:42:10.144 --> 01:42:15.313
If you know what things are decoding, you
can diagnose a person, you can help the person,

01:42:15.313 --> 01:42:16.804
you can raise the kundalini.

01:42:16.804 --> 01:42:18.303
You don’t need me.

01:42:18.303 --> 01:42:21.914
Its like one enlightened light can enlighten
another light.

01:42:21.914 --> 01:42:26.374
Like that we can have so many people who can
get realisation.

01:42:26.374 --> 01:42:48.374
So may God bless you and may God give you
self realisation.

01:42:48.374 --> 01:43:11.053
I like to have questions from you if possible.

01:43:11.053 --> 01:43:13.894
Q: ??

01:43:13.894 --> 01:43:27.574
Residual power meaning you see it a little
complicated thing but I will say that the

01:43:27.574 --> 01:43:28.574
whole being is created, alright, by three
powers within us.

01:43:28.574 --> 01:43:40.914
One is the power on the left hand side which
is the power of desire, another side is the

01:43:40.914 --> 01:43:43.204
power of action.

01:43:43.204 --> 01:43:48.003
And the third is the power of ascent which
is in the centre.

01:43:48.003 --> 01:43:50.303
Now all this has happened.

01:43:50.303 --> 01:43:58.053
But still one energy is not being used and
that is the energy of kundalini which is power

01:43:58.053 --> 01:44:02.974
of pure desire.

01:44:02.974 --> 01:44:06.954
Because according to economics wants are not
sachetable in general.

01:44:06.954 --> 01:44:09.864
Today we want to have a chair, tomorrow we
want to have a table, then we want to have

01:44:09.864 --> 01:44:14.233
a house, then we want to have something else
and like that goes on.

01:44:14.233 --> 01:44:17.063
we are never satisfied.

01:44:17.063 --> 01:44:21.824
So the pure desire the power of pure desire
is the kundalini.

01:44:21.824 --> 01:44:22.993
What is the pure desire.

01:44:22.993 --> 01:44:26.024
Whether you are aware of it or not, subconsciously
or unconsciously whatever you call it; the

01:44:26.024 --> 01:44:32.174
pure desire of kundalini is “to be one with
the divine”.

01:44:32.174 --> 01:44:36.924
This is the pure desire.

01:44:36.924 --> 01:44:42.424
Until you have fulfilled that you will never
be satisfied with yourself.

01:44:42.424 --> 01:44:46.924
Because thats how you know the absolute truth.

01:44:46.924 --> 01:44:52.624
Thats how you become absolutely above all
these weaknesses that you have.

01:44:52.624 --> 01:45:05.454
You become the master of yourself and also
then you jump in the ocean of joy and peace.

01:45:05.454 --> 01:45:13.884
No questions.

01:45:13.884 --> 01:45:18.104
Good ??.

01:45:18.104 --> 01:45:27.974
as I have told you that there are 4000 tapes
and they are available to you.

01:45:27.974 --> 01:45:30.074
You can always listen to them.

01:45:30.074 --> 01:45:36.194
Only thing that I have not told you, one thing
which is important to know is this yellow

01:45:36.194 --> 01:45:42.334
balloon that we have in our head is the balloon
of ego and another one is of the blue is the

01:45:42.334 --> 01:45:43.334
balloon of conditionings in us.

01:45:43.334 --> 01:45:47.894
The conditionings we have had.

01:45:47.894 --> 01:45:55.293
So the kundalini rises she passes through
this crossing point and she sucks in these

01:45:55.293 --> 01:45:56.293
two things.

01:45:56.293 --> 01:46:00.944
Thats how our karma, our conditionings are
sucked in.

01:46:00.944 --> 01:46:07.574
but in childhood when we grow, upto the age
of twelve years these two grow like that and

01:46:07.574 --> 01:46:14.194
cover each other and the fontanelle bone area
which is the soft bone in your childhood is

01:46:14.194 --> 01:46:17.473
completely closed.

01:46:17.473 --> 01:46:22.543
So when the kundalini just sucks in it opens
out.

01:46:22.543 --> 01:46:29.644
And when it opens out then the kundalini passes
through your fontanelle bone area and you

01:46:29.644 --> 01:46:32.803
can feel cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:46:32.803 --> 01:46:35.934
We say its the cool breeze of the holy ghost.

01:46:35.934 --> 01:46:45.144
What is the holy ghost also, you have got
almighty and you have got a son; what about

01:46:45.144 --> 01:46:52.914
the mother ? She is the holy ghost, she is
the primordial mother who we call , in our

01:46:52.914 --> 01:46:55.033
Indian language adishakti.

01:46:55.033 --> 01:46:59.533
In all ancient scriptures like Greece – Athena.

01:46:59.533 --> 01:47:03.634
Athena , atha in Sanskrit means primordial.

01:47:03.634 --> 01:47:09.914
Even here those people who came they call
this river by paramata, is the same.

01:47:09.914 --> 01:47:19.503
So this kundalini is the reflection of the
holy ghost, while spirit is the reflection

01:47:19.503 --> 01:47:22.194
of the God almighty.

01:47:22.194 --> 01:47:28.533
They have to meet and thats how they get realisation.

01:47:28.533 --> 01:47:37.033
The fontanelle bone area is opened out and
you can feel the actualisation of baptism.

01:47:37.033 --> 01:47:38.233
Its not artificial.

01:47:38.233 --> 01:47:41.844
Its actualisation you can feel it, the cool
breeze.

01:47:41.844 --> 01:47:45.384
Ofcourse in the Pentecostal you must have
read that you can feel the cool breeze of

01:47:45.384 --> 01:47:46.664
the holy ghost.

01:47:46.664 --> 01:47:49.313
Thats what you feel on top of your head.

01:47:49.313 --> 01:47:54.924
We got photograph where sahaja yogis are sitting
and in the photograph you see the light on

01:47:54.924 --> 01:47:55.924
their heads.

01:47:55.924 --> 01:48:00.404
And in some of the paintings you must have
seen having light in their head.

01:48:00.404 --> 01:48:05.553
In olden times when there was christianity
at the level of gnostics where they, “gna”

01:48:05.553 --> 01:48:10.934
also the word comes from the same as gyana
which Shri Krishna has described as gyan marg

01:48:10.934 --> 01:48:12.293
(path of knowledge) .

01:48:12.293 --> 01:48:20.513
Gyan doesn’t mean through your brain, but
means, again the same bodha which I told you

01:48:20.513 --> 01:48:21.513
“gna”.

01:48:21.513 --> 01:48:30.644
Same gna is used by Thomas when he described
christianity in his treaties on his way to

01:48:30.644 --> 01:48:34.604
India when he wrote all this an put them in
Egypt and which are found out and now you

01:48:34.604 --> 01:48:36.634
can get that book as “gnosticis??.

01:48:36.634 --> 01:48:42.214
”; important to read because he has ?? all
the ideas of suffering and things .

01:48:42.214 --> 01:48:45.463
Is written everything about sahaja yoga.

01:48:45.463 --> 01:48:48.454
He said its an experience of the self you
must have.

01:48:48.454 --> 01:48:54.694
Like christ has said you have to be born again,
so we certify ourselves.

01:48:54.694 --> 01:48:56.813
How can that be.

01:48:56.813 --> 01:49:00.334
In sanskrit language a born again person is
called dwijaha mean born again.

01:49:00.334 --> 01:49:06.004
And a bird is also called dwija means its
an egg and then it becomes a bird.

01:49:06.004 --> 01:49:10.293
In the same way first we are human beings
and then we become saints.

01:49:10.293 --> 01:49:13.146
This is the second birth we should have.

01:49:13.146 --> 01:49:14.146
But we have to become !.

01:49:14.146 --> 01:49:16.124
It’s not just certificate.

01:49:16.124 --> 01:49:18.034
So every body things ?? of themeselves.

01:49:18.034 --> 01:49:22.733
The other somebody asked me question “Mother,
why there are quarrels among religions?”

01:49:22.733 --> 01:49:27.033
Because they are not following what their
originators have told.

01:49:27.033 --> 01:49:30.364
They are just following some sort of man made
religion.

01:49:30.364 --> 01:49:31.934
That’s why there is problem.

01:49:31.934 --> 01:49:36.194
Because all religions are just the same.

01:49:36.194 --> 01:49:44.023
Born on tree of life at different times and
these flowers were plucked by people saying

01:49:44.023 --> 01:49:47.854
this is mine, this is mine and that’s why
they are fighting.

01:49:47.854 --> 01:49:49.473
These are dead flowers.

01:49:49.473 --> 01:49:50.994
These are not living flowers.

01:49:50.994 --> 01:49:54.783
They come from the same source of spirituality.

01:49:54.783 --> 01:49:58.493
Christ has said those who are not against
me are with me.

01:49:58.493 --> 01:50:01.414
Who are those ? In four years what could he
do christ.

01:50:01.414 --> 01:50:02.414
Its an impossible situation.

01:50:02.414 --> 01:50:04.273
How people were cruel to him.

01:50:04.273 --> 01:50:13.273
I was struggling with 7 hippies; very well
educated hippies in England for 4 years.

01:50:13.273 --> 01:50:14.464
So you can imagine.

01:50:14.464 --> 01:50:23.204
I must give full credit to Christ atleast
he could say so many things about reality.

01:50:23.204 --> 01:50:39.984
Should we have our realisaton.

01:50:39.984 --> 01:50:43.344
(52.

01:50:43.344 --> 01:51:06.844
57)
There is some gentelman, another gentleman.

01:51:06.844 --> 01:51:33.694
??
I think you are little confused about it.

01:51:33.694 --> 01:51:35.734
You haven’t yet seen it what happens.

01:51:35.734 --> 01:51:36.734
Alright .

01:51:36.734 --> 01:51:40.493
After the experience you talk to me about
it then you will be alright.

01:51:40.493 --> 01:51:42.384
A little confused.

01:51:42.384 --> 01:51:48.783
You see, to say that, you see I have told
you one light can enlighten another light.

01:51:48.783 --> 01:51:49.783
Alright.

01:51:49.783 --> 01:51:56.144
In a general way I must say that today’s
sahaja yoga is something very tremendous.

01:51:56.144 --> 01:51:58.993
Because it works amass.

01:51:58.993 --> 01:52:04.704
Just works out, amass, in thousands of people.

01:52:04.704 --> 01:52:11.203
So must be you are also special I must say
or also these are special times and also that

01:52:11.203 --> 01:52:14.914
the divine is angcious to give you realisation.

01:52:14.914 --> 01:52:18.154
All these three things put together.

01:52:18.154 --> 01:52:27.233
But of course, I will tell you how to raise
your kundalini as well as your kundalini will

01:52:27.233 --> 01:52:28.233
rise.

01:52:28.233 --> 01:52:30.394
It will take hardly ten minutes for the whole
thing.

01:52:30.394 --> 01:52:34.504
But one thing is sure, I cannot force on you.

01:52:34.504 --> 01:52:36.424
I respect your freedom.

01:52:36.424 --> 01:52:38.354
Because you have to get your ultimate freedom.

01:52:38.354 --> 01:52:40.483
So I cannot force on you.

01:52:40.483 --> 01:52:53.074
You have to ask for it in your own free will.

01:52:53.074 --> 01:52:57.553
That’s very important.

01:52:57.553 --> 01:53:01.674
It cannot be forced.

01:53:01.674 --> 01:53:03.044
Q: ??

01:53:03.044 --> 01:53:05.884
That’s what we are going to do.

01:53:05.884 --> 01:53:09.174
That’s a very good question.

01:53:09.174 --> 01:53:14.283
That’s the best question.

01:53:14.283 --> 01:53:16.243
Alright.

01:53:16.243 --> 01:53:27.043
So if you are ready then I have to tell you
that there are two conditions.

01:53:27.043 --> 01:53:35.844
The first one is that you have to forget the
past in this hall.

01:53:35.844 --> 01:53:43.874
Forget that you have done any mistakes or
so called sins.

01:53:43.874 --> 01:53:50.053
And, you have to say in your heart that you
are not at all guilty of anything.

01:53:50.053 --> 01:53:53.154
If you were guilty of something you have been
in jail.

01:53:53.154 --> 01:53:54.944
So you are not guilty.

01:53:54.944 --> 01:54:01.694
Afterall you are human beings as I told you
and you are capable of mistakes.

01:54:01.694 --> 01:54:10.874
But the divine has great power of forgiveness
and any mistake can be forgiven.

01:54:10.874 --> 01:54:19.763
So first thing, first condition is that you
have to respect yourself and forgive yourself

01:54:19.763 --> 01:54:23.394
and not to believe at all that you are guilty.

01:54:23.394 --> 01:54:28.114
Its very important for self confidence.

01:54:28.114 --> 01:54:29.463
Everyone can get realisation.

01:54:29.463 --> 01:54:31.984
But firstly one should not feel guilty.

01:54:31.984 --> 01:54:32.984
57.

01:54:32.984 --> 01:54:33.984
03

01:54:33.984 --> 01:54:35.213
Its a myth.

01:54:35.213 --> 01:54:37.713
Alright.

01:54:37.713 --> 01:54:44.864
Second myth is that we cannot forgive some
other people.

01:54:44.864 --> 01:54:49.524
Some people say its very difficult to forgive
others.

01:54:49.524 --> 01:54:53.813
But whether we forgive or don’t forgive,
we don’t do anything.

01:54:53.813 --> 01:55:02.743
What do we do? But if we don’t forgive then
it starts working in our minds, working in

01:55:02.743 --> 01:55:07.084
our temperament and we play into wrong hands
unnecessarily.

01:55:07.084 --> 01:55:13.904
While the person who wants to punish us is
perfectly alright, in good health.

01:55:13.904 --> 01:55:16.523
So this is a myth and we are playing into
wrong hands.

01:55:16.523 --> 01:55:19.493
So we have to say I forgive everyone.

01:55:19.493 --> 01:55:24.523
Now you don’t have to think whom you have
to forgive, what wrong he has done, how far

01:55:24.523 --> 01:55:25.834
you have to go, nothing.

01:55:25.834 --> 01:55:29.884
You just in general you have to say “I forgive
everyone”.

01:55:29.884 --> 01:55:35.503
Is more important in place like Canberra.

01:55:35.503 --> 01:55:44.003
Because I know in a place like this, this
centre [pointing at agya] works very hard;

01:55:44.003 --> 01:55:46.864
thinks thinks thinks too much, this centre.

01:55:46.864 --> 01:55:53.213
And is important to stop thinking, you have
to say “Alright I forgive.

01:55:53.213 --> 01:55:54.213
I forgive.

01:55:54.213 --> 01:55:56.074
Just go on forgiving.

01:55:56.074 --> 01:55:58.463
And you get to it”.

01:55:58.463 --> 01:56:02.713
Say I, I am quiet used people who are bureaucrats.

01:56:02.713 --> 01:56:05.553
I know there situation very well.

01:56:05.553 --> 01:56:11.783
I know them better than any body else I should
say.

01:56:11.783 --> 01:56:16.354
So I have to tell you really very frankly.

01:56:16.354 --> 01:56:20.144
Forgive everyone and also you know that you
are not guilty.

01:56:20.144 --> 01:56:26.074
Because they have always told you have done
this mistake that mistake, and also out of

01:56:26.074 --> 01:56:29.053
jealousy or whatever it is people trouble
them.

01:56:29.053 --> 01:56:31.184
Then they cannot forgive.

01:56:31.184 --> 01:56:33.513
So better forgive everyone.

01:56:33.513 --> 01:56:40.813
Forget everything and be here absolutely free
from all those nonsensical worries.

01:56:40.813 --> 01:56:43.704
Will be a good idea.

01:56:43.704 --> 01:56:50.023
Only by doing these things you will be completely
free I tell you to receive your realisation.

01:56:50.023 --> 01:56:53.523
We have to take help from the mother earth.

01:56:53.523 --> 01:56:58.074
For that we have to take out our shoes, will
help us a lot.

01:56:58.074 --> 01:57:05.724
Just take out your shoes.

01:57:05.724 --> 01:57:14.793
Some people who want to come further can come
further also.

01:57:14.793 --> 01:57:18.684
Its very far away.

01:57:18.684 --> 01:57:20.634
Its alright.

01:57:20.634 --> 01:57:26.463
Makes no difference wherever you are.

01:57:26.463 --> 01:57:34.194
And if I said something that makes you feel
guilty, forget my lecture also.

01:57:34.194 --> 01:57:36.084
Is important.

01:57:36.084 --> 01:57:42.444
So that means in short that we have to be
very pleasantly placed towards ourselves.

01:57:42.444 --> 01:57:45.584
“Prasannachitta, in Sanskrit its said “Prasannachitta”.

01:57:45.584 --> 01:57:48.733
Must be pleasantly placed towards ourselves.

01:57:48.733 --> 01:57:56.703
You have to put both your feet little away
from each other because they represents two

01:57:56.703 --> 01:57:57.703
energies.

01:57:57.703 --> 01:58:00.313
So put them on two sides.

01:58:00.313 --> 01:58:03.983
Children will get realisation without doing
anything.

01:58:03.983 --> 01:58:06.074
They are very good.

01:58:06.074 --> 01:58:08.174
They are not complicated.

01:58:08.174 --> 01:58:09.174
Alright.

01:58:09.174 --> 01:58:12.793
He will show you what is to be done.

01:58:12.793 --> 01:58:19.273
You can see that and after that we will take
out our spectacles and close our eyes and

01:58:19.273 --> 01:58:23.813
then the real awakening will take place.

01:58:23.813 --> 01:58:27.303
Please put your left hand towards me.

01:58:27.303 --> 01:58:28.303
Like this.

01:58:28.303 --> 01:58:36.134
This represent, putting the left hand represents
nothing but the desire to get self realisation.

01:58:36.134 --> 01:58:42.884
And the right hand you have to use for action
and we have to place it at different points

01:58:42.884 --> 01:58:47.293
on the left hand side on our centres.

01:58:47.293 --> 01:58:49.553
So first we put it on our heart.

01:58:49.553 --> 01:58:53.674
Thats very important because in the heart
resides spirit.

01:58:53.674 --> 01:58:58.703
Again I will say in the place like Canberra
is important.

01:58:58.703 --> 01:59:03.374
Because they work so hard, think so hard that
the heart becomes weak.

01:59:03.374 --> 01:59:06.914
Its better to press your hand on your heart.

01:59:06.914 --> 01:59:13.614
You should put under your coat will be a better
idea.

01:59:13.614 --> 01:59:14.614
And.

01:59:14.614 --> 01:59:22.813
Now take down your hand into the upper portion
of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:59:22.813 --> 01:59:26.154
This is the centre of your mastery.

01:59:26.154 --> 01:59:34.174
This is made by many great teachers, masters,
sadgurus.

01:59:34.174 --> 01:59:39.973
And we have to awaken it so that we become
masters of that.

01:59:39.973 --> 01:59:44.313
Then you take down your hand in the lower
portion of your abdomen.

01:59:44.313 --> 01:59:46.964
Lower portion of your abdomen.

01:59:46.964 --> 01:59:49.084
And press it hard.

01:59:49.084 --> 02:00:00.063
Now this is a special centre for pure knowledge
which has to manifest on your central nervous

02:00:00.063 --> 02:00:01.063
system.

02:00:01.063 --> 02:00:05.223
Then we take back our hand in the upper portion
of our abdomen.

02:00:05.223 --> 02:00:11.243
Then take it on our heart.

02:00:11.243 --> 02:00:17.074
Now this important is that put your right
hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder.

02:00:17.074 --> 02:00:18.074
From the front.

02:00:18.074 --> 02:00:19.074
Not from the back side.

02:00:19.074 --> 02:00:25.023
Now this centre is very important because
this is the centre which catches or get spoilt

02:00:25.023 --> 02:00:26.703
when we feel guilty.

02:00:26.703 --> 02:00:29.223
Turn your head to your right.

02:00:29.223 --> 02:00:30.483
Its very important.

02:00:30.483 --> 02:00:37.533
And this centre when is spoilt you get diseases
like spondylitis, angina, all kinds of funny

02:00:37.533 --> 02:00:43.463
diseases, with the lethargic lung and lethargic
heart.

02:00:43.463 --> 02:00:49.684
Now you take your right hand put it across
your forehead.

02:00:49.684 --> 02:00:51.803
Like this.

02:00:51.803 --> 02:00:55.614
And put down your head as much as you can.

02:00:55.614 --> 02:00:57.733
And press it hard.

02:00:57.733 --> 02:01:00.803
On both the sides.

02:01:00.803 --> 02:01:07.973
This is the centre for forgiving others.

02:01:07.973 --> 02:01:16.934
Now take back your hand say way back side
of your head and push back your head, as much

02:01:16.934 --> 02:01:18.303
as possible.

02:01:18.303 --> 02:01:27.154
This is the centre for asking the divine to
forgive you.

02:01:27.154 --> 02:01:29.674
Now here you don’t have to feel guilty.

02:01:29.674 --> 02:01:32.884
You don’t have to count the mistakes you
have committed.

02:01:32.884 --> 02:01:34.684
For your own satisfaction.

02:01:34.684 --> 02:01:37.654
You to ask the divine to forgive you.

02:01:37.654 --> 02:01:43.104
Then you have to stretch your hand, right
hand like this.

02:01:43.104 --> 02:01:49.283
The palm is stretched properly and the centre
o f the palm is put on the fontanelle bone

02:01:49.283 --> 02:01:54.523
area which was a soft bone on top of your
head.

02:01:54.523 --> 02:01:57.704
And now its to be pressed.

02:01:57.704 --> 02:01:59.824
Put down your head.

02:01:59.824 --> 02:02:05.884
This is important now that you push back your
fingers and thumb fully.

02:02:05.884 --> 02:02:06.884
Please.

02:02:06.884 --> 02:02:14.134
Push them back properly so that there is a
good pressure on your scalp.

02:02:14.134 --> 02:02:19.364
And now move your scalp slowly seven times.

02:02:19.364 --> 02:02:36.783
Move your scalp slowly seven times clockwise.

02:02:36.783 --> 02:02:39.723
Clockwise slowly with the pressure.

02:02:39.723 --> 02:02:42.203
Thats all we have to do.

02:02:42.203 --> 02:02:43.203
Thats all.

02:02:43.203 --> 02:02:45.803
Nothing else needed to be done.

02:02:45.803 --> 02:02:46.803
Thats all.

02:02:46.803 --> 02:02:49.194
Take out your glasses if you want.

02:02:49.194 --> 02:02:52.523
If there is anything tight near your neck,
little bit loosen it.

02:02:52.523 --> 02:02:59.063
If there is anything tight on your waist,
you can loosen it a little bit.

02:02:59.063 --> 02:03:00.894
And you have to be relaxed.

02:03:00.894 --> 02:03:04.043
You don’t have to bend forward or backwards
too much.

02:03:04.043 --> 02:03:06.644
Sit in a proper straight manner.

02:03:06.644 --> 02:03:07.644
Thats all.

02:03:07.644 --> 02:03:11.214
Now remember to put your feet on both the
sides.

02:03:11.214 --> 02:03:18.443
And put your left hand towards me please and
the right hand now is to go on the heart.

02:03:18.443 --> 02:03:24.634
Now please close your eyes and don’t open
them till I tell you.

02:03:24.634 --> 02:03:25.834
That’s all.

02:03:25.834 --> 02:03:32.934
Now here when you put your hand on your heart
where resides the spirit you have to ask me

02:03:32.934 --> 02:03:34.973
a very important question.

02:03:34.973 --> 02:03:42.543
You may call me “Shree Mataji or Mother”
which ever suits you and this question is

02:03:42.543 --> 02:03:45.793
like as if you are asking a computer.

02:03:45.793 --> 02:03:53.254
So now ask the question in your heart not
openly, not loudly, but in your hear; “Mother

02:03:53.254 --> 02:03:55.134
Am I the Spirit?”.

02:03:55.134 --> 02:03:56.994
Ask this question three times.

02:03:56.994 --> 02:04:00.084
“Mother Am I the Spirit?”.

02:04:00.084 --> 02:04:07.604
Ask this question three times.

02:04:07.604 --> 02:04:25.253
Now take down your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

02:04:25.253 --> 02:04:30.854
One must know that if you are the spirit you
become your own guide.

02:04:30.854 --> 02:04:34.793
In the light of the spirit you know the absolute
truth.

02:04:34.793 --> 02:04:37.574
So you become your own master.

02:04:37.574 --> 02:04:42.384
So now ask a second question “Mother Am
I my own Master?”.

02:04:42.384 --> 02:04:44.523
Ask this question three times.

02:04:44.523 --> 02:04:59.164
“Mother Am I the Spirit?”.

02:04:59.164 --> 02:05:05.813
As I told you I respect your freedom and I
cannot cross over it.

02:05:05.813 --> 02:05:12.634
And I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

02:05:12.634 --> 02:05:15.263
You have to ask for it.

02:05:15.263 --> 02:05:21.334
Now put right hand in the lower portion of
your abdomen on the left hand side and ask

02:05:21.334 --> 02:05:32.944
me “Mother please give me pure knowledge”,
“Mother please give me pure knowledge”;

02:05:32.944 --> 02:05:35.943
please ask this six times.

02:05:35.943 --> 02:05:40.144
Six times because this centre has got six
petals.

02:05:40.144 --> 02:05:46.594
“please Mother give me pure knowledge”.

02:05:46.594 --> 02:05:55.004
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the
kundalini starts ascending.

02:05:55.004 --> 02:06:02.734
So we have to now nourish our upper centres
with with our self confidence.

02:06:02.734 --> 02:06:09.734
So now raise your right hand in the upper
portion of your abdomen on your left hand

02:06:09.734 --> 02:06:10.734
side.

02:06:10.734 --> 02:06:15.074
And here press it hard.

02:06:15.074 --> 02:06:23.063
And say with full confidence ten times, because
this centre has got ten petals.

02:06:23.063 --> 02:06:29.493
Ten times “Mother I am my own master”.

02:06:29.493 --> 02:06:31.694
Say it with full confidence.

02:06:31.694 --> 02:06:46.344
“Mother I am my own master”.

02:06:46.344 --> 02:07:02.723
Now we have to know that the divine is the
ocean of knowledge and love.

02:07:02.723 --> 02:07:05.544
Pure love.

02:07:05.544 --> 02:07:10.803
It is the ocean of peace and bliss.

02:07:10.803 --> 02:07:19.493
But above all it is a very powerful open ocean
of forgiveness.

02:07:19.493 --> 02:07:30.614
So we cannot do any mistake which cannot be
dissolved by this powerful ocean of forgiveness.

02:07:30.614 --> 02:07:37.494
So please raise your right hand in the corner
of your neck and your shoulder.

02:07:37.494 --> 02:07:41.174
Push it back as much as you can towards the
spinal cord.

02:07:41.174 --> 02:07:42.924
And now put your head towards right.

02:07:42.924 --> 02:07:47.014
Now here with full confidence you have to
say, sixteen times “Mother I am not guilty

02:07:47.014 --> 02:07:48.014
at all” .

02:07:48.014 --> 02:07:49.663
Please say sixteen times.

02:07:49.663 --> 02:07:53.304
“Mother I am not guilty at all” .

02:07:53.304 --> 02:07:54.873
Please say sixteen times.

02:07:54.873 --> 02:08:05.304
Again I will tell you it is a myth when you
say “I cannot forgive people”.

02:08:05.304 --> 02:08:15.244
Whether you forgive or you don’t forgive,
you don’t do anything.

02:08:15.244 --> 02:08:26.984
But if you don’t forgive you really torture
yourself for nothing at all.

02:08:26.984 --> 02:08:34.484
So please remember that it is all a myth and
you are not going to carry on with it anymore.

02:08:34.484 --> 02:08:36.484
This is very important.

02:08:36.484 --> 02:08:45.674
Because this centre is very constricted one
and you have to help your kundalini to rise

02:08:45.674 --> 02:08:50.804
through it by really, heartily forgiving everyone.

02:08:50.804 --> 02:09:00.264
So now please raise your forehead across and
please put your hand in such a manner that

02:09:00.264 --> 02:09:02.754
you can press it on both the sides.

02:09:02.754 --> 02:09:12.804
And now put down your head fully and here
please say “Mother I forgive everyone”.

02:09:12.804 --> 02:09:16.054
Now its not necessary how many times.

02:09:16.054 --> 02:09:18.764
You to have really say from your heart.

02:09:18.764 --> 02:09:21.663
If you don’t say it from your heart, this
centre wouldn’t open otherwise.

02:09:21.663 --> 02:09:29.524
So please I request you again and again to
say “Mother I really forgive everyone”.

02:09:29.524 --> 02:09:35.584
Now don’t think whom you have to forgive,
what mistakes they have committed.

02:09:35.584 --> 02:09:49.574
Just say it out of your understanding that
your realisation is higher than anything else.

02:09:49.574 --> 02:09:59.244
Now take back your hand on the backside of
your head and push back your head as far as

02:09:59.244 --> 02:10:00.244
possible.

02:10:00.244 --> 02:10:08.924
Now this is the centre for you to ask for
forgiveness for your own satisfaction.

02:10:08.924 --> 02:10:15.734
Without feeling guilty, without counting your
mistakes you just have to say “Oh Divine,

02:10:15.734 --> 02:10:24.124
if I have done any mistakes, please forgive
me”.

02:10:24.124 --> 02:10:28.134
For your satisfaction.

02:10:28.134 --> 02:10:33.474
Don’t count your mistakes.

02:10:33.474 --> 02:10:55.333
Now stretch your hand and put the centre of
your palm on the soft bone which is called

02:10:55.333 --> 02:11:01.663
as the fontanelle bone area.

02:11:01.663 --> 02:11:13.664
Press it hard and move it seven times.

02:11:13.664 --> 02:11:17.674
Here again I cannot cross your freedom.

02:11:17.674 --> 02:12:19.913
So please say seven times while moving your
hand “Mother please give me my self realisation”.

02:12:19.913 --> 02:12:35.884
Now please open your eyes and put your hands
like this.

02:12:35.884 --> 02:12:45.114
Now put the right hand towards me , like this
and bend your head and see for your self if

02:12:45.114 --> 02:12:52.734
there is a cool breeze coming out of the fontanelle
bone area or the soft bone that you had in

02:12:52.734 --> 02:12:53.824
your child hood.

02:12:53.824 --> 02:12:55.474
In sanskrit it is called as brahmarandra.

02:12:55.474 --> 02:13:02.854
Brahma means the all pervading power, and
randra means the whole in ?? it.

02:13:02.854 --> 02:13:04.764
Now see for yourself.

02:13:04.764 --> 02:13:11.994
The hand should be little away from the head,
above it not on it.

02:13:11.994 --> 02:13:15.744
Some people get it very far also.

02:13:15.744 --> 02:13:19.024
Now the left hand to be used now.

02:13:19.024 --> 02:13:21.974
Put the left hand towards me, higher like
this.

02:13:21.974 --> 02:13:23.374
Bend your head.

02:13:23.374 --> 02:13:34.554
And see for your self if there is a cool breeze
coming out of your head.

02:13:34.554 --> 02:13:37.054
Now again the right hand.

02:13:37.054 --> 02:13:38.433
Now see for yourself.

02:13:38.433 --> 02:13:43.853
If there is a cool breeze coming out of your
head once for all.

02:13:43.853 --> 02:13:45.524
Will be higher.

02:13:45.524 --> 02:13:46.524
Now.

02:13:46.524 --> 02:13:53.704
Raise your both the hands and push back your
head and ask a question “Mother is this

02:13:53.704 --> 02:13:56.224
the cool breeze of the holy ghost.

02:13:56.224 --> 02:14:04.364
Mother is this the power of all pervading
divine or Mother is this the paramachaitanya”?

02:14:04.364 --> 02:14:09.853
Ask any one of these question, any one of
these three times in your heart.

02:14:09.853 --> 02:14:10.853
Please ask.

02:14:10.853 --> 02:14:14.984
Push back your head, Push back your head and
the question three times.

02:14:14.984 --> 02:14:18.794
Now raise your hands fully.

02:14:18.794 --> 02:14:19.794
Fully.

02:14:19.794 --> 02:14:22.603
Push back your head.

02:14:22.603 --> 02:14:25.654
Push back your head.

02:14:25.654 --> 02:14:28.704
Don’t miss the point.

02:14:28.704 --> 02:14:30.234
Please don’t.

02:14:30.234 --> 02:14:31.744
Push back your head.

02:14:31.744 --> 02:14:34.174
Push back your head.

02:14:34.174 --> 02:14:37.833
Now please bring down your hands.

02:14:37.833 --> 02:14:45.194
Just put the hands towards me and see if you
can be without thoughts.

02:14:45.194 --> 02:14:48.413
If there’s no thought.

02:14:48.413 --> 02:14:57.004
Now those whole felt cool breeze coming out
of the fontanelle bone area, sometimes can

02:14:57.004 --> 02:15:00.084
be hot, some heat comes out; doesn’t matter.

02:15:00.084 --> 02:15:01.594
But feel the breeze.

02:15:01.594 --> 02:15:04.094
Or on your fingertips.

02:15:04.094 --> 02:15:10.555
On their hands please raise both your hands.

02:15:07.415 --> 02:15:19.725
Those who have felt it please raise your hands
both like this, so I will know, like this.

02:15:20.185 --> 02:15:22.517
There are wonderful people here.

02:15:22.507 --> 02:15:25.087
See, such a lot of you have got realisation.

02:15:25.057 --> 02:15:26.407
May God bless you.

02:15:26.487 --> 02:15:30.257
But now this is the beginning.

02:15:30.330 --> 02:15:35.377
You have to come to our centres where of course
you don’t have

02:15:35.443 --> 02:15:36.857
to pay anything.

02:15:36.887 --> 02:15:40.197
But little bit time you have to give and master
it.

02:15:40.237 --> 02:15:42.268
You all can become masters.

02:15:42.297 --> 02:15:47.017
And there wouldn’t be any more problem of
ill health or any problem.

02:15:47.056 --> 02:15:56.426
And I would like to meet you all if you want
to meet me just now.

02:15:56.475 --> 02:15:59.235
Because I am going away tomorrow.

02:15:59.275 --> 02:16:05.025
This is the last day of my working Australia.

02:16:05.085 --> 02:16:09.155
And next year I will be again back here.

02:16:09.225 --> 02:16:11.815
But you are all welcome to India.

02:16:11.865 --> 02:16:17.765
We have a nice tour program and also a seminar
at the end of it.

02:16:17.857 --> 02:16:23.197
So if it suits you, you are welcome to come along.

02:16:23.512 --> 02:16:27.022
You all can come and see me if you like.

02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:30.060
I am sorry I am here only for one day.

02:16:30.110 --> 02:16:33.310
But next time I will be here for quiet some time.

02:16:33.360 --> 02:16:39.150
And I hope I will be able to see you grown
up like a trees now.

02:16:39.209 --> 02:16:45.269
Like a see now you have sprouted now and this
seed has to become a big tree.

02:16:45.359 --> 02:16:48.608
May God bless you.
