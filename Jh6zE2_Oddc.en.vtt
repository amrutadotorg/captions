00:01.686 --> 00:10.293
Today we are celebrating the great event

00:10.492 --> 00:15.563
of the resurrection of Christ.

00:17.938 --> 00:24.359
On the same pattern is your resurrection;

00:24.748 --> 00:34.945
that you have risen to the new life of Divine love.

00:49.272 --> 01:02.000
You were all in the knowledge that
there’s something higher has to happen to you;

01:03.065 --> 01:13.367
that you are to be born again, but nobody knew how it works.

01:14.297 --> 01:24.426
The subtle side of your being was never told to you.

01:25.640 --> 01:30.071
The saints only talked as to how you should behave.

01:30.198 --> 01:40.582
They only said how you should try to keep a very pure life,

01:41.063 --> 01:50.630
sincere life, but they didn't tell you how it will work out.

01:51.174 --> 01:59.542
Of course people knew in India about it,

01:59.741 --> 02:05.764
very few of them, very, very few of them,

02:06.604 --> 02:15.321
but now it's a worldwide knowledge through you people.

02:18.643 --> 02:29.929
Now while your Kundalini rises,
She is your Mother, She is your individual Mother,

02:30.214 --> 02:35.387
and She gives you the second birth.

02:36.128 --> 02:50.098
That's how you get connected to the Divine paradise.

02:51.833 --> 02:57.229
All this, if it is told without realization has no meaning,

02:57.381 --> 03:04.060
but people are given great ideas about it

03:04.179 --> 03:16.632
and also were promised that one day your resurrection will come.

03:17.500 --> 03:21.090
It is the greatest happening for you,

03:23.821 --> 03:27.249
is the greatest event of your life,

03:27.823 --> 03:36.413
and one must consider it’s very fortunate
that you have been able to achieve it.

03:37.444 --> 03:44.754
All this because also because you desired for it.

03:44.818 --> 03:59.833
In many of your lives
you have been desiring for the heavenly paradise.

04:00.846 --> 04:11.814
People have been going round in the
hills and dales seeking; doing all kinds of things.

04:12.432 --> 04:16.442
That's already done by you.

04:16.632 --> 04:23.534
You don't have to give up anything, no need to give up anything.

04:23.962 --> 04:29.712
This wrong idea; I should say an untimely idea.

04:31.239 --> 04:40.183
This is the time when you have to get your
Sahaja resurrection, spontaneous resurrection.

04:41.475 --> 04:48.216
You don't have to do anything about it,

04:48.366 --> 04:54.972
it's just so simple as that; has worked out so well.

04:55.567 --> 05:04.441
I was really very much overjoyed to see that so many people,

05:04.577 --> 05:10.049
specially Muslims, about whom I have been so much worried

05:10.264 --> 05:13.665
that how can you save these people?

05:14.181 --> 05:21.450
They are so much lost in the mess of wrong thinking.

05:24.820 --> 05:33.099
One has to understand that this Koran was written

05:33.500 --> 05:38.646
forty years after the death of Mohammed Sahib.

05:39.559 --> 05:43.923
So maybe that there might be some words which are being,

05:44.001 --> 05:55.995
just being shifted maybe,
and the meaning might be little bit ambiguous.

05:57.154 --> 06:08.020
Also there was another book called Sunna came out about the same time

06:08.803 --> 06:15.766
and was managed by a person who was not such a great

06:15.926 --> 06:21.584
soul I should say, because he was not a realized soul.

06:22.183 --> 06:30.111
I can't understand how can you religiously understand a poet same

06:30.376 --> 06:37.299
and in the poetry whatever is written,
how can you interpret it correctly?

06:37.545 --> 06:43.908
This is the reason why I, I am a poet also;

06:44.059 --> 06:48.882
I could have written a poetry about it but I said no.

06:49.025 --> 06:57.092
Poetry can twist, can be twisted and also people can misuse it.

06:57.568 --> 07:00.287
That’s the problem with the poetry is.

07:00.638 --> 07:03.344
In India we had the same problem.

07:03.981 --> 07:08.256
For example, Kabira wrote such beautiful poetry

07:08.526 --> 07:12.113
and the way they interpreted was so nonsensical

07:12.183 --> 07:19.100
and so much different from the spirit of Kabira's songs.

07:19.346 --> 07:25.047
About everything they can twist the words

07:25.129 --> 07:34.070
according to their own need,
I found out if I wrote poetry about Divinity.

07:35.725 --> 07:39.035
This exactly what has happened.

07:39.154 --> 07:46.861
In all the religions I’ve seen,
when it comes to poetry people can twist it.

07:47.440 --> 08:01.129
Also, like in Bible, it was so much accepted

08:01.308 --> 08:12.039
that Paul is the one who is going to organize
the publication about Christ,

08:13.785 --> 08:18.386
and he didn't want to write also about resurrection;

08:18.581 --> 08:22.961
he didn't want to write about the Immaculate Conception.

08:23.175 --> 08:26.985
All these things were in his mind

08:27.175 --> 08:33.596
and so Thomas had to run away to India
and John refused to write anything.

08:35.141 --> 08:38.345
Because all such people take charge.

08:38.575 --> 08:40.450
They become in charge.

08:40.633 --> 08:47.768
They think they are responsible for it,
while they are not at all capable.

08:47.893 --> 08:51.683
They don't have the right to do it.

08:53.214 --> 08:58.073
As a result of that, Christianity took a very

08:58.162 --> 09:04.192
wrong attitude towards the inner growth of human being.

09:06.271 --> 09:15.326
It’s, you see the result of that - today when you see what's happening

09:15.859 --> 09:19.074
with the Catholic Church, you are amazed.

09:19.189 --> 09:24.730
How can such an organization be a religious organization,

09:24.857 --> 09:29.253
where all kinds of nonsensical things are going on?

09:29.920 --> 09:36.671
I was also born in a Christian family and
I was shocked the way they interpreted

09:37.282 --> 09:42.527
Christ's life and the way talked about it with great authority.

09:43.575 --> 09:45.525
Books and books were written.

09:46.026 --> 09:48.335
They give big, big sermons.

09:48.486 --> 09:52.348
I thought there's no truth in it what they are talking;

09:52.724 --> 09:55.414
even My father felt the same way.

09:56.541 --> 10:02.525
Because all these books came much after,

10:02.938 --> 10:05.806
the authors of these books.

10:06.329 --> 10:12.594
Secondly, those who tried to write it were not authorized to do that.

10:12.787 --> 10:15.067
They were not spiritual people.

10:15.467 --> 10:22.172
They all wanted to have power; they wanted to have power in religion.

10:24.126 --> 10:31.078
The power in religion is inside, and that should be awakened.

10:31.658 --> 10:38.159
I must say thanks to the Sufis of this country and other countries

10:38.265 --> 10:46.685
that people still think that there is something
beyond all these words and talks and books.

10:48.566 --> 10:56.946
This is something, such a blessing that we have
that in every country we had someone

10:57.127 --> 11:00.779
who talked about reality, about the truth;

11:00.914 --> 11:08.157
though they were condemned, they were tortured,
and so many of them were killed.

11:09.245 --> 11:21.551
This is happening even today; I find that
people don't want to listen to reality, to the truth.

11:22.321 --> 11:25.749
But I was so happy yesterday, really overjoyed,

11:25.884 --> 11:33.845
to see that even the people who were Muslims, were Islamic,

11:33.988 --> 11:46.292
have now coming together, understanding that
they have a higher life than these rituals of everyday.

11:46.906 --> 11:55.745
All these ritualistic life that they have led,
the way they have worked so hard,

11:56.509 --> 12:05.996
They these forty days starvation, going for Hajj -

12:06.258 --> 12:11.856
doing all kinds of things - but there was no unity among themselves.

12:11.990 --> 12:15.472
Even among themselves there was no unity,

12:15.533 --> 12:23.226
and some places I was surprised that they were killing each other.

12:25.236 --> 12:27.278
How can that be?

12:27.467 --> 12:34.282
Because these so called practices did not make them collective.

12:34.463 --> 12:36.715
They were not collective.

12:36.795 --> 12:41.621
They were all separate identities, separate sects,

12:41.868 --> 12:49.132
guided by absolutely ignorant people.

12:50.335 --> 12:57.980
So we have to really celebrate the unity of these people,

12:58.036 --> 13:04.654
the collective nature of these people, who were lost to the truth.

13:05.146 --> 13:10.823
They had no idea as to what truth is,

13:11.109 --> 13:19.156
but still a seeker can never find consolation

13:19.243 --> 13:22.338
with whatever exists.

13:22.806 --> 13:29.907
He’s seeking; he’s seeking and seeking till he finds the truth.

13:30.135 --> 13:34.446
But also there are many seekers who lose their way.

13:35.363 --> 13:38.079
In seeking they get lost.

13:38.208 --> 13:44.769
It's very difficult to convince them that you have lost your way.

13:45.031 --> 13:48.991
But they should see from their own lives.

13:49.110 --> 13:56.248
They should see from their own attainment.

13:56.683 --> 14:00.238
What have they achieved?

14:00.720 --> 14:04.028
Have they got any experience?

14:05.044 --> 14:14.242
To be convinced of what you have got, you must try to verify it.

14:15.133 --> 14:22.816
You can verify on people; you can verify on yourself.

14:23.403 --> 14:30.935
Whatever you are, you know on your fingertips as they say.

14:31.408 --> 14:35.286
Now it’s said in the Koran,

14:35.541 --> 14:39.257
that at the time of your Kiyama – means resurrection time –

14:39.319 --> 14:43.808
they’re two things Kiyamat and Kiyama – two things –

14:44.062 --> 14:46.766
also many people don’t understand the difference.

14:46.986 --> 14:51.166
One is when the resurrection time comes,

14:51.250 --> 14:56.388
and the another is when your destruction comes in.

14:56.831 --> 15:02.788
For the resurrection of human being is the Kiyama,

15:02.939 --> 15:08.139
in which it’s said that your hands will speak;

15:08.425 --> 15:14.951
that you should feel the vibrations on your fingertips.

15:15.097 --> 15:27.757
I would say those who are really Muslims,
who are surrendered, and those who have been

15:27.876 --> 15:42.472
selected to be higher people belonging to
the God's realm must have hands that can speak;

15:42.982 --> 15:45.522
otherwise they are not Muslims.

15:45.761 --> 15:47.935
I would not call them Muslims.

15:48.109 --> 15:52.597
They may be human beings, but not Muslims.

15:53.352 --> 15:58.043
So it's compulsory that for every Muslim,

15:58.147 --> 16:04.192
he thinks he’s a Muslim, he should have vibrations in his hands.

16:04.486 --> 16:06.931
He should feel the vibration.

16:07.036 --> 16:21.618
His hands must speak at the time of resurrection,
which is the Kiyama, Kiyama - not Kiyamat.

16:21.957 --> 16:26.967
These two words are confused in the minds of the people.

16:27.087 --> 16:36.670
So those people who can verify about
their achievements themselves

16:36.791 --> 16:40.468
through their vibrations on their hands,

16:40.588 --> 16:46.912
and also about others through their fingertips are the Muslims;

16:47.185 --> 16:53.364
according to Koran, but nobody has told them this.

16:53.820 --> 16:55.245
They don't know.

16:55.473 --> 16:58.675
To them it’s all right if you go to Mecca

16:58.794 --> 17:02.726
and come back from there; you become a Hajji, finished.

17:03.194 --> 17:07.810
There’s another question one should ask which is very important -

17:07.862 --> 17:15.144
that why Mohammed Sahib was so much against stone worshipping,

17:15.216 --> 17:20.047
clearly, why did He ask people to go round

17:20.126 --> 17:24.195
that black square stone?

17:25.350 --> 17:27.630
What was the purpose of that?

17:27.856 --> 17:33.664
Why was that stone so important?

17:34.336 --> 17:42.221
If you ask this question to any so called Muslim
he’ll say that was the order,

17:42.512 --> 17:47.092
but you can ask the question after all why?

17:47.123 --> 17:49.329
That's also just a stone.

17:49.354 --> 17:58.936
So why did, why did Mohammed Sahib ask
that you should go round that stone?

18:00.225 --> 18:06.041
So many statues were there made of stone

18:06.407 --> 18:13.248
and people started worshipping all kinds of statues
as they do in India also.

18:13.655 --> 18:17.532
But this stone was a Swayambhu,

18:17.626 --> 18:23.820
and is mentioned in the Indian scriptures
that there is Macceshwarshiv.

18:24.255 --> 18:30.976
We have Shivas everywhere in India; there are twelve Jyotirlingas.

18:31.173 --> 18:36.893
Now if I tell you, you need not believe Me,
but you can go and verify on your vibrations

18:36.918 --> 18:41.958
if it is a Shiva or not; same with this black stone.

18:42.251 --> 18:47.544
So Mohammed Sahib found out that this is a Macceshwarshiv

18:47.606 --> 18:59.109
and so the people have to go round to achieve Shiva's blessings,
but it became a ritual.

18:59.210 --> 19:07.816
The whole thing became like a ritual
and nobody could go further from that ritual.

19:08.333 --> 19:10.893
Same thing with the Christianity.

19:12.648 --> 19:18.069
Why today is a day they are talking so big
about repentance

19:18.234 --> 19:25.981
and about feeling guilty about what
they have done, but why did they do it?

19:26.527 --> 19:37.033
They are supposed to be in charge of goodness,
of virtues - so why did they do it?

19:37.254 --> 19:43.950
Why did they do wrong things and now asking forgiveness from God?

19:44.103 --> 19:48.679
Because they were not realized souls.

19:49.301 --> 19:51.721
They’re not Sahaja Yogis.

19:51.824 --> 19:56.910
If the Sahaja Yogis try to do something wrong

19:57.326 --> 20:01.002
then they know that they are doing wrong on their fingertips,

20:01.082 --> 20:05.387
or we can ask them to get out of Sahaja Yoga,

20:05.809 --> 20:09.693
but that seems to be the worst punishment for Sahaja Yogis.

20:10.284 --> 20:14.397
If I tell them to get out of Sahaja Yoga, they don't like it.

20:15.067 --> 20:16.565
Why?

20:16.590 --> 20:25.003
Because they feel we are separated from reality.

20:25.313 --> 20:32.544
All the blessings of the reality are lost to them;
they think that way.

20:36.748 --> 20:44.088
The punishment is nothing,
because we just ask you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

20:44.406 --> 20:50.474
To look at it’s nothing, but Sahaja Yoga is complete freedom.

20:51.037 --> 20:54.844
Sahaja Yoga is complete blessing.

20:55.511 --> 20:59.817
Sahaja Yoga is complete peace and joy.

21:00.674 --> 21:07.009
Surprisingly, if you read Koran you’ll be amazed that Mohammed Sahib

21:07.105 --> 21:13.595
wanted to bring peace, but it's not so.

21:15.564 --> 21:19.270
I met one man from Kashmir.

21:19.417 --> 21:22.955
He said that, “Where is the peace?

21:24.042 --> 21:27.411
They are all fighting, fighting; we want peace.”

21:27.736 --> 21:32.741
But surprisingly, he said, “In India we find there’s peace.

21:33.047 --> 21:38.169
But this Kashmir is a mad place
where everybody is all the time challenged

21:38.286 --> 21:43.108
and everything attacked - under the name of Islam itself.”

21:45.015 --> 21:47.393
So I said, it's not Islam.

21:47.515 --> 21:50.418
Islam means surrender.

21:50.505 --> 21:54.056
And he said, “If you surrender they‘ll kill you.

21:54.294 --> 21:58.141
We have no protection.”

21:58.801 --> 22:02.599
It's very surprising, very, very surprising,

22:02.854 --> 22:06.782
how now the Muslims themselves are realizing

22:06.936 --> 22:12.626
that this cannot be Divine life.
This cannot be Divine life,

22:13.015 --> 22:20.626
because in Divine life people are just the same with each other.

22:20.834 --> 22:24.283
You see we had Sufis all over the world.

22:24.636 --> 22:26.392
I have read them.

22:26.417 --> 22:36.444
I have read the Sufis of Turkey and also other places.

22:36.824 --> 22:42.337
Even in India we had Sufis, though
they don't call themselves Sufis so much.

22:42.940 --> 22:50.848
Sufi means, I don't know what ever you may think it,
but according to Indian understanding

22:50.966 --> 22:56.123
Sufi means 'saaf' and 'saaf' means clean, means pure.

22:56.183 --> 22:59.503
Those who are pure people are Sufis.

22:59.765 --> 23:10.152
In the purity they see nothing
but Divine grace, Divine love, Divine peace.

23:10.294 --> 23:15.077
They talked of peace only; they could not talk of war.

23:15.325 --> 23:25.125
Anybody who talks of war cannot be a person who
has got any right to do that.

23:27.434 --> 23:32.528
War is absolutely like madness.

23:32.771 --> 23:35.650
Even animals won't fight like that.

23:35.777 --> 23:42.006
We are even worse than animals when
we think of war and killing each other.

23:43.287 --> 23:49.274
This should not be done and it has to be stopped completely.

23:49.470 --> 23:59.665
Nobody has right to kill anybody unless and until he is attacked.

24:01.160 --> 24:10.415
So what we hear about our resurrection
is this - that we are above so many things.

24:10.721 --> 24:16.572
We have lost all those destructive qualities.

24:16.713 --> 24:26.288
As in Sanskrit they call it we have six enemies –
kama, kroda, mada, mathsarya, loba moha.

24:26.978 --> 24:30.108
Kama means sexual perversion.

24:30.311 --> 24:32.684
Kroda means anger.

24:33.292 --> 24:36.206
Moha means attraction.

24:36.452 --> 24:39.066
Mada means the pride.

24:39.415 --> 24:44.047
Mathsarya means jealously.

24:44.726 --> 24:55.740
All these six things, sixth one is the greed,

24:56.055 --> 25:05.216
all these six things that we had in our mind - out of
our ignorance, out of our upbringing,

25:05.457 --> 25:09.652
out of our reading, whatever it is,

25:09.771 --> 25:15.596
whatever we had developed, we were having - just drops out.

25:16.718 --> 25:23.217
When the Kundalini rises and you become one with the Divine,

25:23.321 --> 25:27.257
then you are on sound grounds.

25:27.616 --> 25:31.572
You realize that you have found the truth

25:31.778 --> 25:37.479
and you no more can enjoy all these destructive habits.

25:37.741 --> 25:40.045
They just drop out.

25:40.443 --> 25:49.353
So you go into a new realm of Divine construction within you.

25:49.766 --> 25:54.045
This is the real resurrection of human beings.

25:54.982 --> 26:03.103
Now, you know that certain subtle things
still remain despite the fact

26:03.206 --> 26:10.079
that people try to destroy the books, to spoil the meaning of things.

26:10.230 --> 26:14.870
Despite that, subtle things remain there.

26:15.427 --> 26:23.962
For example we offer eggs during Easter.

26:24.676 --> 26:28.848
What's the meaning of offering eggs?

26:29.089 --> 26:31.650
Why should we offer an egg?

26:31.978 --> 26:40.523
First of all we offer egg because
the egg can go into a transformation.

26:40.990 --> 26:44.848
It can become a small chick;

26:45.082 --> 26:50.924
it can be born again.
It’s the egg has the capacity to be born again.

26:51.116 --> 27:00.938
So when you get this egg as a symbol of Easter it means -

27:01.002 --> 27:08.453
you can become a different person, a reformed person

27:08.540 --> 27:14.235
and a great spiritual person.
You can become; it means that.

27:14.290 --> 27:16.555
Why do we give eggs?

27:16.608 --> 27:18.618
People don't know.

27:18.769 --> 27:20.789
I asked so many people.

27:20.836 --> 27:25.763
I asked even some priests who think
they are great authorities of Christianity.

27:26.010 --> 27:30.095
They didn't know why they give eggs.

27:30.705 --> 27:42.320
Secondly, if you read the story about
the birth of Shri Ganesh

27:42.484 --> 27:50.251
and then you proceed on, you’ll be surprised is written down
that it was called as Brahmand -

27:50.530 --> 27:58.576
means the egg of the Brahma that came into existence,

27:58.942 --> 28:06.857
and half of it became the Mahavishnu means the Christ,

28:06.960 --> 28:13.380
and half of it remained as Shri Ganesh.

28:13.721 --> 28:23.540
And then it is said that then when Mahavishnu
came out, He started crying for His Father.

28:23.962 --> 28:29.073
Just think of it, He was asking for His Father.

28:29.279 --> 28:36.022
Now if you see Christ, He always uses these two fingers.

28:36.296 --> 28:40.253
No other Incarnation has used these two fingers.

28:40.516 --> 28:48.636
This means you know this is the Vishuddhi and this is the Nabhi.

28:49.546 --> 28:59.670
That means He’s talking of His Father who was Nabhi King.

28:59.695 --> 29:03.183
Who's that? You know that very well is the Vishnu,

29:03.286 --> 29:09.161
and His incarnation as Shri Krishna.

29:09.331 --> 29:15.328
So what He’s indicating is this, that - they are My Father.

29:15.519 --> 29:17.738
How clearly He does that.

29:17.826 --> 29:24.176
Why not have some other mudras,
other style of holding the fingers?

29:24.294 --> 29:28.967
But He hold always these two fingers, meaning -

29:29.047 --> 29:35.013
My Father the one who was Vishnu and who was Shri Krishna.

29:36.632 --> 29:48.995
And then in the lives of Shri Krishna
they say, “Mahavishnu will be Your Son.”

29:49.199 --> 29:55.166
All these things are not put together as
I am telling you; separately,

29:55.248 --> 30:03.640
but if you have proper understanding
you can understand the connection between the two -

30:03.759 --> 30:14.952
that Christ was the son of Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna

30:15.412 --> 30:24.522
and that was blessed that
“You will be the support of the whole universe.”

30:24.677 --> 30:28.526
The support, the adhar of the whole universe, He said it clearly.

30:28.596 --> 30:38.777
It is said so that “You will be supporting the whole universe.”

30:39.275 --> 30:46.163
Now the one half is Shri Ganesh who, is the support in a way;

30:46.258 --> 30:51.428
it supports the Kundalini, it looks after the Kundalini,

30:51.547 --> 30:59.117
it looks after the chastity of the Mother -

30:59.348 --> 31:08.281
and the another one which is expressed is Jesus Christ,

31:08.757 --> 31:14.265
who is the support of the whole universe.

31:14.819 --> 31:21.800
So naturally it has to be the moral basis

31:22.023 --> 31:28.771
as He is a part and parcel of Shri Ganesha,

31:28.985 --> 31:32.467
it's the moral basis of human beings.

31:32.557 --> 31:38.527
On the moral basis only you will be supported;

31:39.196 --> 31:41.889
not all other nonsense that they have,

31:42.064 --> 31:50.746
but a moral basis, and which is missing
in the lives of Christianity.

31:50.970 --> 31:56.698
Everything is allowed, very surprising.

31:57.032 --> 32:05.446
You can do whatever you like as long as
you don't take a divorce in the Catholic Church.

32:05.922 --> 32:15.430
And also in the other Church which you can call
non-Catholic Churches, there are many,

32:15.751 --> 32:26.632
even if you are married, you can do whatever you like.

32:26.990 --> 32:32.705
Even the Vatican I was told has all these problems.

32:33.452 --> 32:40.342
How can that be if you are the people who think you are baptized?

32:40.817 --> 32:45.727
I mean there's a big celebration of baptism by these priests.

32:46.033 --> 32:50.790
Then where is the Sahasrara and where is the Kundalini

32:50.836 --> 32:53.911
and how do you have your second birth?

32:54.379 --> 32:59.264
There's no second birth, just some priest puts his hand on your head.

32:59.449 --> 33:04.241
Actually it makes a problem for realized souls,

33:04.424 --> 33:09.054
to put hand of the priest who are not realized souls,

33:09.427 --> 33:12.761
and that creates a problem for children.

33:12.786 --> 33:16.712
I have seen many children they start crying loudly

33:16.824 --> 33:20.922
when they are being blessed by these priests,

33:21.731 --> 33:25.689
because they are realized souls and the priests are not.

33:25.796 --> 33:28.216
It's very interesting.

33:28.303 --> 33:32.570
But they say, “After all you see it's the priests that are bad,

33:32.614 --> 33:37.331
but not Christ.” But how are they related to each other?

33:37.568 --> 33:42.043
Christ stood for morality.

33:43.812 --> 33:51.763
And about Him also in these modern times
they are saying all kinds of filthy things.

33:52.004 --> 34:01.648
They cannot understand a character
which is moral; to this extent we have gone.

34:03.446 --> 34:07.337
Morality is out of question.

34:07.949 --> 34:14.573
You do whatever you like; as long as
you go to church and confess, you’re all right.

34:15.335 --> 34:21.074
These are the absurdities of modern religions.

34:21.277 --> 34:29.552
Every religion has problems and the worst  I feel,
when you have

34:29.876 --> 34:33.759
the support of the world as your leader -

34:33.879 --> 34:41.505
how can you allow people to have such a immoral life?

34:44.003 --> 34:53.472
Immorality how can you tolerate when you follow the example of Christ?

34:53.931 --> 34:57.478
Out of question!

34:57.829 --> 35:02.710
He is the embodiment of morality.

35:02.854 --> 35:10.899
He is Shri Ganesh and how can you allow people

35:11.368 --> 35:15.876
to come to churches, to the temples,

35:16.300 --> 35:21.800
and allow them to have immoral life?

35:22.221 --> 35:26.890
What is the atonement for such people?

35:27.937 --> 35:39.045
The basis of Christ's life, the whole being
of Christ is morality; to establish purity.

35:41.595 --> 35:48.394
Now, it was Shri Ganesha who was created first

35:48.584 --> 35:56.683
by the Adishakti, because She wanted purity around.

35:58.516 --> 36:05.085
She wanted human beings to enjoy their purity

36:05.164 --> 36:14.745
and their personality which was emitting light to others.

36:15.276 --> 36:21.616
If there is impurity say for example on a glass

36:21.882 --> 36:28.923
and if you use that glass on top of the light,
how can the light pass out?

36:29.581 --> 36:37.546
The impure life cannot, cannot give light to others,

36:37.601 --> 36:41.501
and cannot show your inner light also.

36:41.565 --> 36:49.881
Both things are absolutely true about impurities.

36:50.495 --> 36:54.732
But people say that we have to accept

36:54.844 --> 36:59.875
because if you have to have more people for your religion

36:59.949 --> 37:06.351
you should accept many things, and one of them is impurity.

37:08.949 --> 37:11.287
And just think of it.

37:11.418 --> 37:16.185
Now at the Agnya where Christ resides,

37:16.455 --> 37:22.296
if your eyes are impure, full of lust and greed,

37:23.067 --> 37:31.158
then you are against Christ; you are an antichrist.

37:32.576 --> 37:40.175
If your eyes are clean and pure,

37:40.499 --> 37:49.801
then only you can enjoy love of God, otherwise you cannot.

37:50.844 --> 37:58.266
And also the love of another Sahaja Yogi or Yogini you can only enjoy

37:58.349 --> 38:03.142
in completeness if your eyes are clean.

38:03.229 --> 38:05.645
Just imagine.

38:06.255 --> 38:15.946
But if you have roving eyes and all sorts of things, I don't know

38:16.304 --> 38:20.933
how can you call yourself Christians? You cannot.

38:21.888 --> 38:26.169
Whatever certificate you may carry, but you are not,

38:26.338 --> 38:33.707
because those who are following Christ
have to have absolutely a moral life.

38:34.231 --> 38:42.237
That's a compulsion of the inner being on you -

38:42.437 --> 38:48.274
that you enjoy your morality

38:48.783 --> 38:56.016
and you enjoy above all your clean eyes.

38:57.359 --> 39:07.992
This is what I have come to know about the Western life
that the eyes are not clean.

39:08.127 --> 39:13.031
They’ll go to the church and their eyes will be moving here and there.

39:13.183 --> 39:15.453
How can that be?

39:15.485 --> 39:17.894
How can you do that?

39:17.919 --> 39:24.900
If you think Christ is the one who was resurrected
and you are to be resurrected,

39:24.976 --> 39:31.284
first of all see that you have pure love in your eyes.

39:31.667 --> 39:39.728
Now pure love is not relative, cannot be contaminated,

39:40.061 --> 39:45.267
cannot have lust and greed in them.

39:46.842 --> 39:52.443
These two things have to drop out from your mind completely.

39:53.023 --> 40:02.499
These are the days of people having greed, lots of greed they have.

40:04.974 --> 40:08.677
I just don't know what sort of things they have because

40:08.765 --> 40:13.023
I haven't studied so much the immorality of human being.

40:13.885 --> 40:18.431
Whatever I see are beautiful people like you.

40:18.810 --> 40:26.591
But when I try to understand the so-called Western culture

40:26.750 --> 40:32.350
I am surprised that even if they want to make a life for someone -

40:32.612 --> 40:38.001
like “The Life of Shakespeare” I saw,
who was according to Me

40:38.200 --> 40:46.366
was Avadhoota; means a person who has gone beyond all human

40:46.657 --> 40:54.624
destructive habits, Avadhoot is a very high quality yogi -

40:54.838 --> 41:01.369
and they show him as a stupid man running after a woman.

41:01.711 --> 41:13.531
They cannot conceive of human beings
who could be morally perfect, who will have moral sense.

41:13.602 --> 41:22.270
They cannot conceive, because those
who do this kind of thing are not realized soul.

41:22.499 --> 41:24.860
They are not Sahaja Yogis.

41:24.963 --> 41:30.660
So the conception about morality doesn't come into their head.

41:30.819 --> 41:33.837
They think as we are like that, the others are.

41:33.890 --> 41:38.521
Actually mostly they do it to justify themselves.

41:38.688 --> 41:50.208
So ugly and so horrifying is the depiction
of the character of such great people

41:50.335 --> 41:59.066
who talk such great things, shows that human beings
are really degraded in their value system.

41:59.199 --> 42:07.187
They cannot conceive of somebody who is an ideal personality.

42:07.546 --> 42:16.126
They think by saying so they are talking of something beyond reality.

42:16.181 --> 42:19.146
They don't know reality.

42:20.653 --> 42:24.574
Yesterday’s Sufi thing, I was very impressed

42:24.599 --> 42:27.918
when they said about the four stages that you have.

42:29.076 --> 42:33.785
And out of that the Haakikat - means the reality,

42:34.087 --> 42:38.642
you have to get into the reality.

42:39.493 --> 42:41.695
Reality is what?

42:42.107 --> 42:45.188
It’s not a perception.

42:45.371 --> 42:50.917
It's not seeing something, but it’s being something.

42:53.458 --> 43:00.509
If you start seeing, you might see something
white, red, yellow but you are not that.

43:00.722 --> 43:09.766
When you are, you are the reality,
then you emit reality,

43:10.083 --> 43:15.951
you see reality, you enjoy reality, you live in reality.

43:16.126 --> 43:21.237
This is real life and you don't indulge into

43:21.301 --> 43:28.582
something which is unreal, imaginary or below dignity.

43:28.607 --> 43:30.153
No you don't do it.

43:30.256 --> 43:35.361
You are the reality, is the Haakikat, as they say.

43:35.437 --> 43:41.894
You are the reality and you are emitting reality

43:41.950 --> 43:49.360
in your behavior, in your talks, in your lives, in everything.

43:51.939 --> 44:01.629
All this brings forth the greatest force of spirituality.

44:04.508 --> 44:12.933
Whatever is falsehood, whatever is wrong, whatever is destructive,

44:13.465 --> 44:19.709
will run away from a man who stands in reality; is automatic.

44:22.027 --> 44:26.928
It is absolutely part and parcel

44:27.134 --> 44:32.440
of the same personality who is supposed to be a realized soul.

44:32.985 --> 44:38.604
So the resurrection has taken place no doubt - all right.

44:38.857 --> 44:41.427
Your hands are speaking - all right.

44:41.586 --> 44:53.331
I don't want to give you any command or
any kind of a fixed road that you have to follow.

44:53.652 --> 44:57.902
Now you are free, because you have the light.

44:58.004 --> 45:00.987
When you have the light why should I tell you which way to go?

45:01.012 --> 45:10.002
You know yourself that you have the light,
so you follow yourself in a way

45:10.097 --> 45:15.450
that is an enlightened path, with your own light.

45:15.577 --> 45:19.607
Don’t somebody has to tell you
hat don't do this, don't do, nothing of the kind.

45:19.790 --> 45:25.056
You want just do it, if something wrong
you will not do; if you are doing it

45:25.090 --> 45:31.125
then know that you have to still rise above all this thing.

45:31.728 --> 45:37.719
You are the Nabhis that are described in the Koran.

45:37.959 --> 45:43.290
You are the ones who are going to resurrect the whole world.

45:43.449 --> 45:50.782
You are the ones who are going to help the downtrodden people

45:50.918 --> 45:56.428
into the filth of immorality. Your life should show.

45:56.555 --> 46:05.639
Look at these few of these people who were Sufis,

46:05.830 --> 46:13.058
who were very clean people, how have they been able to channelize

46:13.415 --> 46:16.616
the other people into a better life?

46:17.411 --> 46:19.826
That is what you are.

46:19.989 --> 46:25.484
You have to channelize their lives; that's your job.

46:25.606 --> 46:33.366
Don't think about what is happening,
how the people are stupid, immoral, forget it.

46:33.621 --> 46:36.431
What you have to know what you are.

46:36.519 --> 46:44.040
You have to be aware of yourself
and of your responsibility as being the purest of pure.

46:44.415 --> 46:49.066
As my name is indicates, you are My children,

46:49.165 --> 46:54.982
and that indicates the children of Nirmal, means purity.

46:55.217 --> 47:00.977
Purity is the basis of your existence.

47:01.833 --> 47:07.966
You should try to see where, what you were, in which part.

47:08.238 --> 47:13.867
There’s no mistake in appreciating the art,

47:14.026 --> 47:20.446
appreciating all that is beautiful, appreciating all

47:21.216 --> 47:25.653
that is created out of beautiful minds,

47:25.756 --> 47:30.554
but there should be no lust and greed in that appreciation.

47:30.849 --> 47:36.364
Pure appreciation, purity is the message,

47:36.418 --> 47:41.946
and once you have the purity within yourself you will love yourself.

47:42.221 --> 47:45.570
As I love you, you will love you also.

47:45.618 --> 47:52.472
And then you will understand this word love
which comes out of the purity.

47:52.759 --> 48:01.907
The blossoming of your purity,
the fragrance of your purity, you enjoy all the time

48:02.048 --> 48:08.050
and the love that you have flows,

48:08.161 --> 48:14.811
flows towards all those who are to be loved,
who have to be looked after.

48:15.128 --> 48:21.417
Don’t worry about the people who are destructive.

48:21.586 --> 48:26.612
That's the only word I can use,
because there are so many things one can say about.

48:26.811 --> 48:32.001
Let them be destructive because they are destroying themselves.

48:32.102 --> 48:34.683
Why should we worry about them?

48:34.754 --> 48:37.196
They think they are destroying others but they are not,

48:37.331 --> 48:42.011
they are destroying themselves.
So forget about it, just forget.

48:42.164 --> 48:51.866
You think yourself to be responsible for the construction
of the whole world,

48:51.933 --> 48:54.653
it's not only a few people.

48:54.971 --> 48:59.694
You are very intelligent, knowledgeable and understanding.

48:59.789 --> 49:04.405
You are not like the Disciples of Christ who were not educated,

49:04.432 --> 49:12.327
who didn't understand so much and
who did get realization but were not of your level.

49:12.981 --> 49:21.152
Whatever they could do reached to a point
where this kind of a mess of a Christianity has come,

49:21.556 --> 49:24.488
but you can't create that kind.

49:24.572 --> 49:34.595
You will create a new vibrant religion which is global.

49:34.816 --> 49:41.108
I was very happy to see that now
we have people from all over the world.

49:41.354 --> 49:43.980
It’s a global movement all over.

49:44.520 --> 49:51.559
It has nothing to do with the limited ideas of so called religions.

49:51.845 --> 49:54.956
They have ruined every religion.

49:54.995 --> 50:03.220
Islam is ruined, Christianity ruined,
and Hinduism ruined, and Buddhism the worst.

50:03.733 --> 50:06.763
In Buddhism you give up everything -

50:06.938 --> 50:14.216
all your belongings, all your property, give to the guru, imagine!

50:14.645 --> 50:22.133
And the guru is so greedy horrible fellow.

50:22.972 --> 50:29.528
How can he give resurrection?
Himself is a greedy fellow,

50:29.743 --> 50:35.606
misleading others just taking away everything.

50:36.633 --> 50:40.194
Then same thing about Christianity

50:40.297 --> 50:43.300
that you all become Nuns,
you become Fathers, you become

50:43.325 --> 50:47.078
Brothers and I don’t know, all nonsense.

50:47.335 --> 50:50.855
But there's no change within.

50:52.156 --> 50:58.265
Somebody came to Me and I said, “Why did you become a priest?”

50:58.354 --> 51:01.064
He said, “Because I was jobless.

51:02.421 --> 51:04.166
I had no job.”

51:04.166 --> 51:05.166
Baba?

51:05.166 --> 51:07.608
“So I took up the job of a priest.”

51:07.687 --> 51:09.147
Can you imagine?

51:09.785 --> 51:16.712
He could not fit into any job, so the minimum of minimum
he took is this job.

51:17.039 --> 51:19.269
Then what did you do?

51:19.443 --> 51:25.913
“They told me what I have to preach and first I had to practice

51:26.331 --> 51:30.823
and remember it by heart, and then I don't know,

51:30.947 --> 51:37.859
I started talking this, talking that.”
I said he must be a big possessed man.

51:38.026 --> 51:43.495
He had no mind of his own; he didn't know what he was talking.

51:43.630 --> 51:50.296
He would take out one sentence from Bible
and go on talking, boring everybody.

51:50.477 --> 51:57.708
And I was surprised that within fifteen minutes
people wanted to get out of the church.

51:58.074 --> 52:05.581
As soon as the sermon was over they would run out
and breathe, “Thank God.”

52:06.335 --> 52:10.318
Is that what religion gives you?

52:10.533 --> 52:13.186
Is that what should happen to you?

52:13.305 --> 52:16.189
No, it's not that.

52:16.333 --> 52:22.496
What happens to you that
you enjoy yourself, you enjoy the collectivity,

52:22.521 --> 52:24.795
you enjoy the goodness, the morality.

52:24.795 --> 52:30.878
The whole thing is like the nectar of life.

52:32.057 --> 52:36.616
So that changes the whole picture.

52:37.163 --> 52:43.916
The ritualism is so much; in the Hindu religion
there is too much of ritualism.

52:44.173 --> 52:51.670
You sit on the right or you sit on the left;
you do this at this time I mean, lots of it.

52:51.834 --> 52:56.668
That when your sister dies how many days you should starve yourself;

52:56.693 --> 53:00.085
if your husband dies then how many days?

53:01.019 --> 53:06.407
Dies is died, finished; the body’s finished now.

53:06.778 --> 53:11.129
So you fast for so many days - is very wrong,

53:11.154 --> 53:14.840
because you’re fasting the bhoot might come in to you.

53:17.846 --> 53:23.589
But still, what I would say all these ritualisms and all that,

53:23.729 --> 53:32.181
are created by human beings
who were claiming to be something great.

53:32.369 --> 53:39.493
They are not; by no means they are the people in charge of morality,

53:39.540 --> 53:44.483
in charge of higher life.

53:45.054 --> 53:50.597
They lead such a mundane useless life.

53:52.682 --> 53:55.876
I went to a temple of Shri Ganesha,

53:55.960 --> 54:02.000
which is supposed to be Swayambhu,
one of the eight temples; it is one of them.

54:05.270 --> 54:06.977
And I was surprised.

54:07.002 --> 54:16.225
The man who was worshipping was supposed to be the priest,
he was suffering from paralysis,

54:16.799 --> 54:24.319
and his brother died of paralysis, now his son was also paralyzed.

54:24.605 --> 54:27.733
He said, “What is this Ganesha doing to us Mother?”

54:27.758 --> 54:31.268
I said, “What are you doing to Ganesha?

54:31.530 --> 54:35.540
How much money you earn out of it?”

54:35.643 --> 54:38.252
He said, “Quite a lot.”

54:38.514 --> 54:40.769
“And then what do you do with this money?

54:40.794 --> 54:43.638
Do you do anything for the society?

54:43.663 --> 54:46.188
Do you try to improve their lives?

54:46.213 --> 54:52.750
Have you any attention on the society
or you are just ooking after yourself?”

54:52.905 --> 54:59.377
As a result, he’s got paralysis,
his brother got paralysis, son got paralysis.

54:59.776 --> 55:03.422
And he was blaming Ganesha for that.

55:03.922 --> 55:08.664
He said, “Is it a real Ganesha?”
“Yes it is, but you are not.

55:08.974 --> 55:12.050
You don't deserve.”
I told him off on his face.

55:12.193 --> 55:15.624
He said, “All right you may say whatever you like but You cure me.”

55:15.743 --> 55:21.011
I said, “First promise that whatever money you get out of this temple

55:21.036 --> 55:25.855
you will spend it for the betterment of people.”

55:26.814 --> 55:29.845
But how can they?

55:31.289 --> 55:33.669
They are not realized souls.

55:33.772 --> 55:39.042
Such a lot of priests I see walking about with all this funny dresses.

55:39.082 --> 55:40.082
What?

55:40.273 --> 55:47.402
These are like dead bodies,
walking around with all kinds bad vibrations.

55:48.228 --> 55:50.423
I can't understand.

55:50.691 --> 55:56.651
And the other people are very simple,
they say, "Oh my goodness, see now he’s a priest."

55:56.850 --> 55:58.723
So they must respect.

55:58.748 --> 56:02.460
But, they don't see it; they do not ascertain

56:02.485 --> 56:10.085
what is the spiritual value of that person
who calls himself as the priest.

56:11.499 --> 56:13.629
That is your job.

56:13.732 --> 56:15.351
You don't have to fight with them.

56:15.376 --> 56:17.225
You don't have to denounce them.

56:17.225 --> 56:20.346
You don't have to describe them.

56:20.346 --> 56:24.186
No need, but understand that you are different.

56:24.186 --> 56:28.061
You have the right. You are the authority

56:28.275 --> 56:31.430
and so with that authority and confidence

56:31.455 --> 56:34.525
you have to go about and save people.

56:34.525 --> 56:37.974
You are realized souls.

56:38.127 --> 56:40.828
You got your resurrection.

56:40.860 --> 56:46.890
You are yogis; I agree, but what is your job?

56:47.176 --> 56:49.567
Why, why this has happened?

56:49.654 --> 56:56.447
Why this light has come in to you is to take the blind

56:57.106 --> 57:02.387
in your hands and take them towards the light.

57:02.625 --> 57:06.502
This is what is your resurrection for.

57:06.677 --> 57:16.012
It's not only for your seeking but also is the grace of the Divine,

57:16.126 --> 57:21.194
for you to make the whole world Divine, as far as possible.

57:21.279 --> 57:24.218
How many people have you given realization?

57:24.298 --> 57:26.332
How many people you have talked to them?

57:26.357 --> 57:29.759
I tell you I was surprised; once I was traveling by plane

57:29.879 --> 57:33.403
and there was some lady traveling with Me

57:33.428 --> 57:38.351
and she started talking to Me about her cult, about her nonsense.

57:38.376 --> 57:42.008
So look at it, shamelessly she was talking.

57:42.285 --> 57:47.833
Listening to her I said, Sahaja Yogis won't,
they won't talk about Sahaja Yoga.

57:48.060 --> 57:53.824
Every person who is a Sahaja Yogi has to talk about Sahaja Yoga,

57:54.014 --> 57:58.342
may not be with the wrong type but with the right type of people.

57:58.854 --> 58:03.236
That's a thing you have to do. That's why you are enlightened.

58:03.603 --> 58:08.389
You are not enlightened to be put somewhere in the forest

58:08.897 --> 58:11.832
or to be lost to the whole world.

58:11.857 --> 58:17.706
You are enlightened; you are resurrected to enlighten other people.

58:17.816 --> 58:21.145
That's what you are there for

58:21.709 --> 58:24.299
and you can do it. Many have done it.

58:24.340 --> 58:26.661
So many of you have done it,

58:26.716 --> 58:33.310
and I would say that all of you, whether
you are a man or a woman, you have to do it.

58:34.993 --> 58:45.456
And that's the request of your Mother - t
hat make use of your realization.

58:46.094 --> 58:52.559
And the attention should be only on realization.

58:52.944 --> 58:58.097
How many people you are going to give realization to?

58:58.334 --> 59:02.221
How many people you are going to save?

59:03.102 --> 59:06.166
Is a very simple job for you.

59:06.223 --> 59:08.204
You have to just raise the Kundalini.

59:08.302 --> 59:09.352
You can.

59:09.495 --> 59:14.011
You should see how just with your hand
you can raise the Kundalini of others

59:14.036 --> 59:16.716
and give them their resurrection.

59:17.118 --> 59:19.364
You don't have to do anything.

59:19.389 --> 59:22.633
The life is not that difficult for you.

59:22.672 --> 59:26.831
Your job is the easiest thing; it’s just to raise your hand.

59:26.856 --> 59:29.307
In hand, in your hand you have the power,

59:29.382 --> 59:38.185
just to raise your hand and give them realization,
instead of feeling diffident.

59:39.582 --> 59:44.100
That's why I would say you are all resurrected,

59:44.188 --> 59:47.041
you are all realized souls,

59:47.209 --> 59:51.278
and you have to create the Divine paradise on this earth.
