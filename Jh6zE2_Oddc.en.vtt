00:00:01.686 --> 00:00:10.293
Today we are celebrating the great event

00:00:10.492 --> 00:00:15.563
of the resurrection of Christ.

00:00:17.938 --> 00:00:24.359
On the same pattern is your resurrection;

00:00:24.748 --> 00:00:34.945
that you have risen to the new life of Divine love.

00:00:49.272 --> 00:01:02.000
You were all in the knowledge that
there’s something higher has to happen to you;

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:13.367
that you are to be born again, but nobody knew how it works.

00:01:14.297 --> 00:01:24.426
The subtle side of your being was never told to you.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.071
The saints only talked as to how you should behave.

00:01:30.198 --> 00:01:40.582
They only said how you should try to keep a very pure life,

00:01:41.063 --> 00:01:50.630
sincere life, but they didn't tell you how it will work out.

00:01:51.174 --> 00:01:59.542
Of course people knew in India about it,

00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:05.764
very few of them, very, very few of them,

00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:15.321
but now it's a worldwide knowledge through you people.

00:02:18.643 --> 00:02:29.929
Now while your Kundalini rises,
She is your Mother, She is your individual Mother,

00:02:30.214 --> 00:02:35.387
and She gives you the second birth.

00:02:36.128 --> 00:02:50.098
That's how you get connected to the Divine paradise.

00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:57.229
All this, if it is told without realization has no meaning,

00:02:57.381 --> 00:03:04.060
but people are given great ideas about it

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:16.632
and also were promised that one day your resurrection will come.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.090
It is the greatest happening for you,

00:03:23.821 --> 00:03:27.249
is the greatest event of your life,

00:03:27.823 --> 00:03:36.413
and one must consider it’s very fortunate
that you have been able to achieve it.

00:03:37.444 --> 00:03:44.754
All this because also because you desired for it.

00:03:44.818 --> 00:03:59.833
In many of your lives
you have been desiring for the heavenly paradise.

00:04:00.846 --> 00:04:11.814
People have been going round in the
hills and dales seeking; doing all kinds of things.

00:04:12.432 --> 00:04:16.442
That's already done by you.

00:04:16.632 --> 00:04:23.534
You don't have to give up anything, no need to give up anything.

00:04:23.962 --> 00:04:29.712
This wrong idea; I should say an untimely idea.

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:40.183
This is the time when you have to get your
Sahaja resurrection, spontaneous resurrection.

00:04:41.475 --> 00:04:48.216
You don't have to do anything about it,

00:04:48.366 --> 00:04:54.972
it's just so simple as that; has worked out so well.

00:04:55.567 --> 00:05:04.441
I was really very much overjoyed to see that so many people,

00:05:04.577 --> 00:05:10.049
specially Muslims, about whom I have been so much worried

00:05:10.264 --> 00:05:13.665
that how can you save these people?

00:05:14.181 --> 00:05:21.450
They are so much lost in the mess of wrong thinking.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:33.099
One has to understand that this Koran was written

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.646
forty years after the death of Mohammed Sahib.

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:43.923
So maybe that there might be some words which are being,

00:05:44.001 --> 00:05:55.995
just being shifted maybe,
and the meaning might be little bit ambiguous.

00:05:57.154 --> 00:06:08.020
Also there was another book called Sunna came out about the same time

00:06:08.803 --> 00:06:15.766
and was managed by a person who was not such a great

00:06:15.926 --> 00:06:21.584
soul I should say, because he was not a realized soul.

00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:30.111
I can't understand how can you religiously understand a poet same

00:06:30.376 --> 00:06:37.299
and in the poetry whatever is written,
how can you interpret it correctly?

00:06:37.545 --> 00:06:43.908
This is the reason why I, I am a poet also;

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:48.882
I could have written a poetry about it but I said no.

00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:57.092
Poetry can twist, can be twisted and also people can misuse it.

00:06:57.568 --> 00:07:00.287
That’s the problem with the poetry is.

00:07:00.638 --> 00:07:03.344
In India we had the same problem.

00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:08.256
For example, Kabira wrote such beautiful poetry

00:07:08.526 --> 00:07:12.113
and the way they interpreted was so nonsensical

00:07:12.183 --> 00:07:19.100
and so much different from the spirit of Kabira's songs.

00:07:19.346 --> 00:07:25.047
About everything they can twist the words

00:07:25.129 --> 00:07:34.070
according to their own need,
I found out if I wrote poetry about Divinity.

00:07:35.725 --> 00:07:39.035
This exactly what has happened.

00:07:39.154 --> 00:07:46.861
In all the religions I’ve seen,
when it comes to poetry people can twist it.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:08:01.129
Also, like in Bible, it was so much accepted

00:08:01.308 --> 00:08:12.039
that Paul is the one who is going to organize
the publication about Christ,

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:18.386
and he didn't want to write also about resurrection;

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:22.961
he didn't want to write about the Immaculate Conception.

00:08:23.175 --> 00:08:26.985
All these things were in his mind

00:08:27.175 --> 00:08:33.596
and so Thomas had to run away to India
and John refused to write anything.

00:08:35.141 --> 00:08:38.345
Because all such people take charge.

00:08:38.575 --> 00:08:40.450
They become in charge.

00:08:40.633 --> 00:08:47.768
They think they are responsible for it,
while they are not at all capable.

00:08:47.893 --> 00:08:51.683
They don't have the right to do it.

00:08:53.214 --> 00:08:58.073
As a result of that, Christianity took a very

00:08:58.162 --> 00:09:04.192
wrong attitude towards the inner growth of human being.

00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:15.326
It’s, you see the result of that - today when you see what's happening

00:09:15.859 --> 00:09:19.074
with the Catholic Church, you are amazed.

00:09:19.189 --> 00:09:24.730
How can such an organization be a religious organization,

00:09:24.857 --> 00:09:29.253
where all kinds of nonsensical things are going on?

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:36.671
I was also born in a Christian family and
I was shocked the way they interpreted

00:09:37.282 --> 00:09:42.527
Christ's life and the way talked about it with great authority.

00:09:43.575 --> 00:09:45.525
Books and books were written.

00:09:46.026 --> 00:09:48.335
They give big, big sermons.

00:09:48.486 --> 00:09:52.348
I thought there's no truth in it what they are talking;

00:09:52.724 --> 00:09:55.414
even My father felt the same way.

00:09:56.541 --> 00:10:02.525
Because all these books came much after,

00:10:02.938 --> 00:10:05.806
the authors of these books.

00:10:06.329 --> 00:10:12.594
Secondly, those who tried to write it were not authorized to do that.

00:10:12.787 --> 00:10:15.067
They were not spiritual people.

00:10:15.467 --> 00:10:22.172
They all wanted to have power; they wanted to have power in religion.

00:10:24.126 --> 00:10:31.078
The power in religion is inside, and that should be awakened.

00:10:31.658 --> 00:10:38.159
I must say thanks to the Sufis of this country and other countries

00:10:38.265 --> 00:10:46.685
that people still think that there is something
beyond all these words and talks and books.

00:10:48.566 --> 00:10:56.946
This is something, such a blessing that we have
that in every country we had someone

00:10:57.127 --> 00:11:00.779
who talked about reality, about the truth;

00:11:00.914 --> 00:11:08.157
though they were condemned, they were tortured,
and so many of them were killed.

00:11:09.245 --> 00:11:21.551
This is happening even today; I find that
people don't want to listen to reality, to the truth.

00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:25.749
But I was so happy yesterday, really overjoyed,

00:11:25.884 --> 00:11:33.845
to see that even the people who were Muslims, were Islamic,

00:11:33.988 --> 00:11:46.292
have now coming together, understanding that
they have a higher life than these rituals of everyday.

00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:55.745
All these ritualistic life that they have led,
the way they have worked so hard,

00:11:56.509 --> 00:12:05.996
They these forty days starvation, going for Hajj -

00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:11.856
doing all kinds of things - but there was no unity among themselves.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.472
Even among themselves there was no unity,

00:12:15.533 --> 00:12:23.226
and some places I was surprised that they were killing each other.

00:12:25.236 --> 00:12:27.278
How can that be?

00:12:27.467 --> 00:12:34.282
Because these so called practices did not make them collective.

00:12:34.463 --> 00:12:36.715
They were not collective.

00:12:36.795 --> 00:12:41.621
They were all separate identities, separate sects,

00:12:41.868 --> 00:12:49.132
guided by absolutely ignorant people.

00:12:50.335 --> 00:12:57.980
So we have to really celebrate the unity of these people,

00:12:58.036 --> 00:13:04.654
the collective nature of these people, who were lost to the truth.

00:13:05.146 --> 00:13:10.823
They had no idea as to what truth is,

00:13:11.109 --> 00:13:19.156
but still a seeker can never find consolation

00:13:19.243 --> 00:13:22.338
with whatever exists.

00:13:22.806 --> 00:13:29.907
He’s seeking; he’s seeking and seeking till he finds the truth.

00:13:30.135 --> 00:13:34.446
But also there are many seekers who lose their way.

00:13:35.363 --> 00:13:38.079
In seeking they get lost.

00:13:38.208 --> 00:13:44.769
It's very difficult to convince them that you have lost your way.

00:13:45.031 --> 00:13:48.991
But they should see from their own lives.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:56.248
They should see from their own attainment.

00:13:56.683 --> 00:14:00.238
What have they achieved?

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.028
Have they got any experience?

00:14:05.044 --> 00:14:14.242
To be convinced of what you have got, you must try to verify it.

00:14:15.133 --> 00:14:22.816
You can verify on people; you can verify on yourself.

00:14:23.403 --> 00:14:30.935
Whatever you are, you know on your fingertips as they say.

00:14:31.408 --> 00:14:35.286
Now it’s said in the Koran,

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:39.257
that at the time of your Kiyama – means resurrection time –

00:14:39.319 --> 00:14:43.808
they’re two things Kiyamat and Kiyama – two things –

00:14:44.062 --> 00:14:46.766
also many people don’t understand the difference.

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:51.166
One is when the resurrection time comes,

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:56.388
and the another is when your destruction comes in.

00:14:56.831 --> 00:15:02.788
For the resurrection of human being is the Kiyama,

00:15:02.939 --> 00:15:08.139
in which it’s said that your hands will speak;

00:15:08.425 --> 00:15:14.951
that you should feel the vibrations on your fingertips.

00:15:15.097 --> 00:15:27.757
I would say those who are really Muslims,
who are surrendered, and those who have been

00:15:27.876 --> 00:15:42.472
selected to be higher people belonging to
the God's realm must have hands that can speak;

00:15:42.982 --> 00:15:45.522
otherwise they are not Muslims.

00:15:45.761 --> 00:15:47.935
I would not call them Muslims.

00:15:48.109 --> 00:15:52.597
They may be human beings, but not Muslims.

00:15:53.352 --> 00:15:58.043
So it's compulsory that for every Muslim,

00:15:58.147 --> 00:16:04.192
he thinks he’s a Muslim, he should have vibrations in his hands.

00:16:04.486 --> 00:16:06.931
He should feel the vibration.

00:16:07.036 --> 00:16:21.618
His hands must speak at the time of resurrection,
which is the Kiyama, Kiyama - not Kiyamat.

00:16:21.957 --> 00:16:26.967
These two words are confused in the minds of the people.

00:16:27.087 --> 00:16:36.670
So those people who can verify about
their achievements themselves

00:16:36.791 --> 00:16:40.468
through their vibrations on their hands,

00:16:40.588 --> 00:16:46.912
and also about others through their fingertips are the Muslims;

00:16:47.185 --> 00:16:53.364
according to Koran, but nobody has told them this.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.245
They don't know.

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:58.675
To them it’s all right if you go to Mecca

00:16:58.794 --> 00:17:02.726
and come back from there; you become a Hajji, finished.

00:17:03.194 --> 00:17:07.810
There’s another question one should ask which is very important -

00:17:07.862 --> 00:17:15.144
that why Mohammed Sahib was so much against stone worshipping,

00:17:15.216 --> 00:17:20.047
clearly, why did He ask people to go round

00:17:20.126 --> 00:17:24.195
that black square stone?

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:27.630
What was the purpose of that?

00:17:27.856 --> 00:17:33.664
Why was that stone so important?

00:17:34.336 --> 00:17:42.221
If you ask this question to any so called Muslim
he’ll say that was the order,

00:17:42.512 --> 00:17:47.092
but you can ask the question after all why?

00:17:47.123 --> 00:17:49.329
That's also just a stone.

00:17:49.354 --> 00:17:58.936
So why did, why did Mohammed Sahib ask
that you should go round that stone?

00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:06.041
So many statues were there made of stone

00:18:06.407 --> 00:18:13.248
and people started worshipping all kinds of statues
as they do in India also.

00:18:13.655 --> 00:18:17.532
But this stone was a Swayambhu,

00:18:17.626 --> 00:18:23.820
and is mentioned in the Indian scriptures
that there is Macceshwarshiv.

00:18:24.255 --> 00:18:30.976
We have Shivas everywhere in India; there are twelve Jyotirlingas.

00:18:31.173 --> 00:18:36.893
Now if I tell you, you need not believe Me,
but you can go and verify on your vibrations

00:18:36.918 --> 00:18:41.958
if it is a Shiva or not; same with this black stone.

00:18:42.251 --> 00:18:47.544
So Mohammed Sahib found out that this is a Macceshwarshiv

00:18:47.606 --> 00:18:59.109
and so the people have to go round to achieve Shiva's blessings,
but it became a ritual.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:07.816
The whole thing became like a ritual
and nobody could go further from that ritual.

00:19:08.333 --> 00:19:10.893
Same thing with the Christianity.

00:19:12.648 --> 00:19:18.069
Why today is a day they are talking so big
about repentance

00:19:18.234 --> 00:19:25.981
and about feeling guilty about what
they have done, but why did they do it?

00:19:26.527 --> 00:19:37.033
They are supposed to be in charge of goodness,
of virtues - so why did they do it?

00:19:37.254 --> 00:19:43.950
Why did they do wrong things and now asking forgiveness from God?

00:19:44.103 --> 00:19:48.679
Because they were not realized souls.

00:19:49.301 --> 00:19:51.721
They’re not Sahaja Yogis.

00:19:51.824 --> 00:19:56.910
If the Sahaja Yogis try to do something wrong

00:19:57.326 --> 00:20:01.002
then they know that they are doing wrong on their fingertips,

00:20:01.082 --> 00:20:05.387
or we can ask them to get out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:05.809 --> 00:20:09.693
but that seems to be the worst punishment for Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:10.284 --> 00:20:14.397
If I tell them to get out of Sahaja Yoga, they don't like it.

00:20:15.067 --> 00:20:16.565
Why?

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:25.003
Because they feel we are separated from reality.

00:20:25.313 --> 00:20:32.544
All the blessings of the reality are lost to them;
they think that way.

00:20:36.748 --> 00:20:44.088
The punishment is nothing,
because we just ask you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:44.406 --> 00:20:50.474
To look at it’s nothing, but Sahaja Yoga is complete freedom.

00:20:51.037 --> 00:20:54.844
Sahaja Yoga is complete blessing.

00:20:55.511 --> 00:20:59.817
Sahaja Yoga is complete peace and joy.

00:21:00.674 --> 00:21:07.009
Surprisingly, if you read Koran you’ll be amazed that Mohammed Sahib

00:21:07.105 --> 00:21:13.595
wanted to bring peace, but it's not so.

00:21:15.564 --> 00:21:19.270
I met one man from Kashmir.

00:21:19.417 --> 00:21:22.955
He said that, “Where is the peace?

00:21:24.042 --> 00:21:27.411
They are all fighting, fighting; we want peace.”

00:21:27.736 --> 00:21:32.741
But surprisingly, he said, “In India we find there’s peace.

00:21:33.047 --> 00:21:38.169
But this Kashmir is a mad place
where everybody is all the time challenged

00:21:38.286 --> 00:21:43.108
and everything attacked - under the name of Islam itself.”

00:21:45.015 --> 00:21:47.393
So I said, it's not Islam.

00:21:47.515 --> 00:21:50.418
Islam means surrender.

00:21:50.505 --> 00:21:54.056
And he said, “If you surrender they‘ll kill you.

00:21:54.294 --> 00:21:58.141
We have no protection.”

00:21:58.801 --> 00:22:02.599
It's very surprising, very, very surprising,

00:22:02.854 --> 00:22:06.782
how now the Muslims themselves are realizing

00:22:06.936 --> 00:22:12.626
that this cannot be Divine life.
This cannot be Divine life,

00:22:13.015 --> 00:22:20.626
because in Divine life people are just the same with each other.

00:22:20.834 --> 00:22:24.283
You see we had Sufis all over the world.

00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:26.392
I have read them.

00:22:26.417 --> 00:22:36.444
I have read the Sufis of Turkey and also other places.

00:22:36.824 --> 00:22:42.337
Even in India we had Sufis, though
they don't call themselves Sufis so much.

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:50.848
Sufi means, I don't know what ever you may think it,
but according to Indian understanding

00:22:50.966 --> 00:22:56.123
Sufi means 'saaf' and 'saaf' means clean, means pure.

00:22:56.183 --> 00:22:59.503
Those who are pure people are Sufis.

00:22:59.765 --> 00:23:10.152
In the purity they see nothing
but Divine grace, Divine love, Divine peace.

00:23:10.294 --> 00:23:15.077
They talked of peace only; they could not talk of war.

00:23:15.325 --> 00:23:25.125
Anybody who talks of war cannot be a person who
has got any right to do that.

00:23:27.434 --> 00:23:32.528
War is absolutely like madness.

00:23:32.771 --> 00:23:35.650
Even animals won't fight like that.

00:23:35.777 --> 00:23:42.006
We are even worse than animals when
we think of war and killing each other.

00:23:43.287 --> 00:23:49.274
This should not be done and it has to be stopped completely.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:59.665
Nobody has right to kill anybody unless and until he is attacked.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:10.415
So what we hear about our resurrection
is this - that we are above so many things.

00:24:10.721 --> 00:24:16.572
We have lost all those destructive qualities.

00:24:16.713 --> 00:24:26.288
As in Sanskrit they call it we have six enemies –
kama, kroda, mada, mathsarya, loba moha.

00:24:26.978 --> 00:24:30.108
Kama means sexual perversion.

00:24:30.311 --> 00:24:32.684
Kroda means anger.

00:24:33.292 --> 00:24:36.206
Moha means attraction.

00:24:36.452 --> 00:24:39.066
Mada means the pride.

00:24:39.415 --> 00:24:44.047
Mathsarya means jealously.

00:24:44.726 --> 00:24:55.740
All these six things, sixth one is the greed,

00:24:56.055 --> 00:25:05.216
all these six things that we had in our mind - out of
our ignorance, out of our upbringing,

00:25:05.457 --> 00:25:09.652
out of our reading, whatever it is,

00:25:09.771 --> 00:25:15.596
whatever we had developed, we were having - just drops out.

00:25:16.718 --> 00:25:23.217
When the Kundalini rises and you become one with the Divine,

00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:27.257
then you are on sound grounds.

00:25:27.616 --> 00:25:31.572
You realize that you have found the truth

00:25:31.778 --> 00:25:37.479
and you no more can enjoy all these destructive habits.

00:25:37.741 --> 00:25:40.045
They just drop out.

00:25:40.443 --> 00:25:49.353
So you go into a new realm of Divine construction within you.

00:25:49.766 --> 00:25:54.045
This is the real resurrection of human beings.

00:25:54.982 --> 00:26:03.103
Now, you know that certain subtle things
still remain despite the fact

00:26:03.206 --> 00:26:10.079
that people try to destroy the books, to spoil the meaning of things.

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:14.870
Despite that, subtle things remain there.

00:26:15.427 --> 00:26:23.962
For example we offer eggs during Easter.

00:26:24.676 --> 00:26:28.848
What's the meaning of offering eggs?

00:26:29.089 --> 00:26:31.650
Why should we offer an egg?

00:26:31.978 --> 00:26:40.523
First of all we offer egg because
the egg can go into a transformation.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:44.848
It can become a small chick;

00:26:45.082 --> 00:26:50.924
it can be born again.
It’s the egg has the capacity to be born again.

00:26:51.116 --> 00:27:00.938
So when you get this egg as a symbol of Easter it means -

00:27:01.002 --> 00:27:08.453
you can become a different person, a reformed person

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:14.235
and a great spiritual person.
You can become; it means that.

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:16.555
Why do we give eggs?

00:27:16.608 --> 00:27:18.618
People don't know.

00:27:18.769 --> 00:27:20.789
I asked so many people.

00:27:20.836 --> 00:27:25.763
I asked even some priests who think
they are great authorities of Christianity.

00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:30.095
They didn't know why they give eggs.

00:27:30.705 --> 00:27:42.320
Secondly, if you read the story about
the birth of Shri Ganesh

00:27:42.484 --> 00:27:50.251
and then you proceed on, you’ll be surprised is written down
that it was called as Brahmand -

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:58.576
means the egg of the Brahma that came into existence,

00:27:58.942 --> 00:28:06.857
and half of it became the Mahavishnu means the Christ,

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:13.380
and half of it remained as Shri Ganesh.

00:28:13.721 --> 00:28:23.540
And then it is said that then when Mahavishnu
came out, He started crying for His Father.

00:28:23.962 --> 00:28:29.073
Just think of it, He was asking for His Father.

00:28:29.279 --> 00:28:36.022
Now if you see Christ, He always uses these two fingers.

00:28:36.296 --> 00:28:40.253
No other Incarnation has used these two fingers.

00:28:40.516 --> 00:28:48.636
This means you know this is the Vishuddhi and this is the Nabhi.

00:28:49.546 --> 00:28:59.670
That means He’s talking of His Father who was Nabhi King.

00:28:59.695 --> 00:29:03.183
Who's that? You know that very well is the Vishnu,

00:29:03.286 --> 00:29:09.161
and His incarnation as Shri Krishna.

00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:15.328
So what He’s indicating is this, that - they are My Father.

00:29:15.519 --> 00:29:17.738
How clearly He does that.

00:29:17.826 --> 00:29:24.176
Why not have some other mudras,
other style of holding the fingers?

00:29:24.294 --> 00:29:28.967
But He hold always these two fingers, meaning -

00:29:29.047 --> 00:29:35.013
My Father the one who was Vishnu and who was Shri Krishna.

00:29:36.632 --> 00:29:48.995
And then in the lives of Shri Krishna
they say, “Mahavishnu will be Your Son.”

00:29:49.199 --> 00:29:55.166
All these things are not put together as
I am telling you; separately,

00:29:55.248 --> 00:30:03.640
but if you have proper understanding
you can understand the connection between the two -

00:30:03.759 --> 00:30:14.952
that Christ was the son of Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna

00:30:15.412 --> 00:30:24.522
and that was blessed that
“You will be the support of the whole universe.”

00:30:24.677 --> 00:30:28.526
The support, the adhar of the whole universe, He said it clearly.

00:30:28.596 --> 00:30:38.777
It is said so that “You will be supporting the whole universe.”

00:30:39.275 --> 00:30:46.163
Now the one half is Shri Ganesh who, is the support in a way;

00:30:46.258 --> 00:30:51.428
it supports the Kundalini, it looks after the Kundalini,

00:30:51.547 --> 00:30:59.117
it looks after the chastity of the Mother -

00:30:59.348 --> 00:31:08.281
and the another one which is expressed is Jesus Christ,

00:31:08.757 --> 00:31:14.265
who is the support of the whole universe.

00:31:14.819 --> 00:31:21.800
So naturally it has to be the moral basis

00:31:22.023 --> 00:31:28.771
as He is a part and parcel of Shri Ganesha,

00:31:28.985 --> 00:31:32.467
it's the moral basis of human beings.

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:38.527
On the moral basis only you will be supported;

00:31:39.196 --> 00:31:41.889
not all other nonsense that they have,

00:31:42.064 --> 00:31:50.746
but a moral basis, and which is missing
in the lives of Christianity.

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:56.698
Everything is allowed, very surprising.

00:31:57.032 --> 00:32:05.446
You can do whatever you like as long as
you don't take a divorce in the Catholic Church.

00:32:05.922 --> 00:32:15.430
And also in the other Church which you can call
non-Catholic Churches, there are many,

00:32:15.751 --> 00:32:26.632
even if you are married, you can do whatever you like.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:32.705
Even the Vatican I was told has all these problems.

00:32:33.452 --> 00:32:40.342
How can that be if you are the people who think you are baptized?

00:32:40.817 --> 00:32:45.727
I mean there's a big celebration of baptism by these priests.

00:32:46.033 --> 00:32:50.790
Then where is the Sahasrara and where is the Kundalini

00:32:50.836 --> 00:32:53.911
and how do you have your second birth?

00:32:54.379 --> 00:32:59.264
There's no second birth, just some priest puts his hand on your head.

00:32:59.449 --> 00:33:04.241
Actually it makes a problem for realized souls,

00:33:04.424 --> 00:33:09.054
to put hand of the priest who are not realized souls,

00:33:09.427 --> 00:33:12.761
and that creates a problem for children.

00:33:12.786 --> 00:33:16.712
I have seen many children they start crying loudly

00:33:16.824 --> 00:33:20.922
when they are being blessed by these priests,

00:33:21.731 --> 00:33:25.689
because they are realized souls and the priests are not.

00:33:25.796 --> 00:33:28.216
It's very interesting.

00:33:28.303 --> 00:33:32.570
But they say, “After all you see it's the priests that are bad,

00:33:32.614 --> 00:33:37.331
but not Christ.” But how are they related to each other?

00:33:37.568 --> 00:33:42.043
Christ stood for morality.

00:33:43.812 --> 00:33:51.763
And about Him also in these modern times
they are saying all kinds of filthy things.

00:33:52.004 --> 00:34:01.648
They cannot understand a character
which is moral; to this extent we have gone.

00:34:03.446 --> 00:34:07.337
Morality is out of question.

00:34:07.949 --> 00:34:14.573
You do whatever you like; as long as
you go to church and confess, you’re all right.

00:34:15.335 --> 00:34:21.074
These are the absurdities of modern religions.

00:34:21.277 --> 00:34:29.552
Every religion has problems and the worst  I feel,
when you have

00:34:29.876 --> 00:34:33.759
the support of the world as your leader -

00:34:33.879 --> 00:34:41.505
how can you allow people to have such a immoral life?

00:34:44.003 --> 00:34:53.472
Immorality how can you tolerate when you follow the example of Christ?

00:34:53.931 --> 00:34:57.478
Out of question!

00:34:57.829 --> 00:35:02.710
He is the embodiment of morality.

00:35:02.854 --> 00:35:10.899
He is Shri Ganesh and how can you allow people

00:35:11.368 --> 00:35:15.876
to come to churches, to the temples,

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:21.800
and allow them to have immoral life?

00:35:22.221 --> 00:35:26.890
What is the atonement for such people?

00:35:27.937 --> 00:35:39.045
The basis of Christ's life, the whole being
of Christ is morality; to establish purity.

00:35:41.595 --> 00:35:48.394
Now, it was Shri Ganesha who was created first

00:35:48.584 --> 00:35:56.683
by the Adishakti, because She wanted purity around.

00:35:58.516 --> 00:36:05.085
She wanted human beings to enjoy their purity

00:36:05.164 --> 00:36:14.745
and their personality which was emitting light to others.

00:36:15.276 --> 00:36:21.616
If there is impurity say for example on a glass

00:36:21.882 --> 00:36:28.923
and if you use that glass on top of the light,
how can the light pass out?

00:36:29.581 --> 00:36:37.546
The impure life cannot, cannot give light to others,

00:36:37.601 --> 00:36:41.501
and cannot show your inner light also.

00:36:41.565 --> 00:36:49.881
Both things are absolutely true about impurities.

00:36:50.495 --> 00:36:54.732
But people say that we have to accept

00:36:54.844 --> 00:36:59.875
because if you have to have more people for your religion

00:36:59.949 --> 00:37:06.351
you should accept many things, and one of them is impurity.

00:37:08.949 --> 00:37:11.287
And just think of it.

00:37:11.418 --> 00:37:16.185
Now at the Agnya where Christ resides,

00:37:16.455 --> 00:37:22.296
if your eyes are impure, full of lust and greed,

00:37:23.067 --> 00:37:31.158
then you are against Christ; you are an antichrist.

00:37:32.576 --> 00:37:40.175
If your eyes are clean and pure,

00:37:40.499 --> 00:37:49.801
then only you can enjoy love of God, otherwise you cannot.

00:37:50.844 --> 00:37:58.266
And also the love of another Sahaja Yogi or Yogini you can only enjoy

00:37:58.349 --> 00:38:03.142
in completeness if your eyes are clean.

00:38:03.229 --> 00:38:05.645
Just imagine.

00:38:06.255 --> 00:38:15.946
But if you have roving eyes and all sorts of things, I don't know

00:38:16.304 --> 00:38:20.933
how can you call yourself Christians? You cannot.

00:38:21.888 --> 00:38:26.169
Whatever certificate you may carry, but you are not,

00:38:26.338 --> 00:38:33.707
because those who are following Christ
have to have absolutely a moral life.

00:38:34.231 --> 00:38:42.237
That's a compulsion of the inner being on you -

00:38:42.437 --> 00:38:48.274
that you enjoy your morality

00:38:48.783 --> 00:38:56.016
and you enjoy above all your clean eyes.

00:38:57.359 --> 00:39:07.992
This is what I have come to know about the Western life
that the eyes are not clean.

00:39:08.127 --> 00:39:13.031
They’ll go to the church and their eyes will be moving here and there.

00:39:13.183 --> 00:39:15.453
How can that be?

00:39:15.485 --> 00:39:17.894
How can you do that?

00:39:17.919 --> 00:39:24.900
If you think Christ is the one who was resurrected
and you are to be resurrected,

00:39:24.976 --> 00:39:31.284
first of all see that you have pure love in your eyes.

00:39:31.667 --> 00:39:39.728
Now pure love is not relative, cannot be contaminated,

00:39:40.061 --> 00:39:45.267
cannot have lust and greed in them.

00:39:46.842 --> 00:39:52.443
These two things have to drop out from your mind completely.

00:39:53.023 --> 00:40:02.499
These are the days of people having greed, lots of greed they have.

00:40:04.974 --> 00:40:08.677
I just don't know what sort of things they have because

00:40:08.765 --> 00:40:13.023
I haven't studied so much the immorality of human being.

00:40:13.885 --> 00:40:18.431
Whatever I see are beautiful people like you.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:26.591
But when I try to understand the so-called Western culture

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:32.350
I am surprised that even if they want to make a life for someone -

00:40:32.612 --> 00:40:38.001
like “The Life of Shakespeare” I saw,
who was according to Me

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:46.366
was Avadhoota; means a person who has gone beyond all human

00:40:46.657 --> 00:40:54.624
destructive habits, Avadhoot is a very high quality yogi -

00:40:54.838 --> 00:41:01.369
and they show him as a stupid man running after a woman.

00:41:01.711 --> 00:41:13.531
They cannot conceive of human beings
who could be morally perfect, who will have moral sense.

00:41:13.602 --> 00:41:22.270
They cannot conceive, because those
who do this kind of thing are not realized soul.

00:41:22.499 --> 00:41:24.860
They are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:41:24.963 --> 00:41:30.660
So the conception about morality doesn't come into their head.

00:41:30.819 --> 00:41:33.837
They think as we are like that, the others are.

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:38.521
Actually mostly they do it to justify themselves.

00:41:38.688 --> 00:41:50.208
So ugly and so horrifying is the depiction
of the character of such great people

00:41:50.335 --> 00:41:59.066
who talk such great things, shows that human beings
are really degraded in their value system.

00:41:59.199 --> 00:42:07.187
They cannot conceive of somebody who is an ideal personality.

00:42:07.546 --> 00:42:16.126
They think by saying so they are talking of something beyond reality.

00:42:16.181 --> 00:42:19.146
They don't know reality.

00:42:20.653 --> 00:42:24.574
Yesterday’s Sufi thing, I was very impressed

00:42:24.599 --> 00:42:27.918
when they said about the four stages that you have.

00:42:29.076 --> 00:42:33.785
And out of that the Haakikat - means the reality,

00:42:34.087 --> 00:42:38.642
you have to get into the reality.

00:42:39.493 --> 00:42:41.695
Reality is what?

00:42:42.107 --> 00:42:45.188
It’s not a perception.

00:42:45.371 --> 00:42:50.917
It's not seeing something, but it’s being something.

00:42:53.458 --> 00:43:00.509
If you start seeing, you might see something
white, red, yellow but you are not that.

00:43:00.722 --> 00:43:09.766
When you are, you are the reality,
then you emit reality,

00:43:10.083 --> 00:43:15.951
you see reality, you enjoy reality, you live in reality.

00:43:16.126 --> 00:43:21.237
This is real life and you don't indulge into

00:43:21.301 --> 00:43:28.582
something which is unreal, imaginary or below dignity.

00:43:28.607 --> 00:43:30.153
No you don't do it.

00:43:30.256 --> 00:43:35.361
You are the reality, is the Haakikat, as they say.

00:43:35.437 --> 00:43:41.894
You are the reality and you are emitting reality

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:49.360
in your behavior, in your talks, in your lives, in everything.

00:43:51.939 --> 00:44:01.629
All this brings forth the greatest force of spirituality.

00:44:04.508 --> 00:44:12.933
Whatever is falsehood, whatever is wrong, whatever is destructive,

00:44:13.465 --> 00:44:19.709
will run away from a man who stands in reality; is automatic.

00:44:22.027 --> 00:44:26.928
It is absolutely part and parcel

00:44:27.134 --> 00:44:32.440
of the same personality who is supposed to be a realized soul.

00:44:32.985 --> 00:44:38.604
So the resurrection has taken place no doubt - all right.

00:44:38.857 --> 00:44:41.427
Your hands are speaking - all right.

00:44:41.586 --> 00:44:53.331
I don't want to give you any command or
any kind of a fixed road that you have to follow.

00:44:53.652 --> 00:44:57.902
Now you are free, because you have the light.

00:44:58.004 --> 00:45:00.987
When you have the light why should I tell you which way to go?

00:45:01.012 --> 00:45:10.002
You know yourself that you have the light,
so you follow yourself in a way

00:45:10.097 --> 00:45:15.450
that is an enlightened path, with your own light.

00:45:15.577 --> 00:45:19.607
Don’t somebody has to tell you
hat don't do this, don't do, nothing of the kind.

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:25.056
You want just do it, if something wrong
you will not do; if you are doing it

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:31.125
then know that you have to still rise above all this thing.

00:45:31.728 --> 00:45:37.719
You are the Nabhis that are described in the Koran.

00:45:37.959 --> 00:45:43.290
You are the ones who are going to resurrect the whole world.

00:45:43.449 --> 00:45:50.782
You are the ones who are going to help the downtrodden people

00:45:50.918 --> 00:45:56.428
into the filth of immorality. Your life should show.

00:45:56.555 --> 00:46:05.639
Look at these few of these people who were Sufis,

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:13.058
who were very clean people, how have they been able to channelize

00:46:13.415 --> 00:46:16.616
the other people into a better life?

00:46:17.411 --> 00:46:19.826
That is what you are.

00:46:19.989 --> 00:46:25.484
You have to channelize their lives; that's your job.

00:46:25.606 --> 00:46:33.366
Don't think about what is happening,
how the people are stupid, immoral, forget it.

00:46:33.621 --> 00:46:36.431
What you have to know what you are.

00:46:36.519 --> 00:46:44.040
You have to be aware of yourself
and of your responsibility as being the purest of pure.

00:46:44.415 --> 00:46:49.066
As my name is indicates, you are My children,

00:46:49.165 --> 00:46:54.982
and that indicates the children of Nirmal, means purity.

00:46:55.217 --> 00:47:00.977
Purity is the basis of your existence.

00:47:01.833 --> 00:47:07.966
You should try to see where, what you were, in which part.

00:47:08.238 --> 00:47:13.867
There’s no mistake in appreciating the art,

00:47:14.026 --> 00:47:20.446
appreciating all that is beautiful, appreciating all

00:47:21.216 --> 00:47:25.653
that is created out of beautiful minds,

00:47:25.756 --> 00:47:30.554
but there should be no lust and greed in that appreciation.

00:47:30.849 --> 00:47:36.364
Pure appreciation, purity is the message,

00:47:36.418 --> 00:47:41.946
and once you have the purity within yourself you will love yourself.

00:47:42.221 --> 00:47:45.570
As I love you, you will love you also.

00:47:45.618 --> 00:47:52.472
And then you will understand this word love
which comes out of the purity.

00:47:52.759 --> 00:48:01.907
The blossoming of your purity,
the fragrance of your purity, you enjoy all the time

00:48:02.048 --> 00:48:08.050
and the love that you have flows,

00:48:08.161 --> 00:48:14.811
flows towards all those who are to be loved,
who have to be looked after.

00:48:15.128 --> 00:48:21.417
Don’t worry about the people who are destructive.

00:48:21.586 --> 00:48:26.612
That's the only word I can use,
because there are so many things one can say about.

00:48:26.811 --> 00:48:32.001
Let them be destructive because they are destroying themselves.

00:48:32.102 --> 00:48:34.683
Why should we worry about them?

00:48:34.754 --> 00:48:37.196
They think they are destroying others but they are not,

00:48:37.331 --> 00:48:42.011
they are destroying themselves.
So forget about it, just forget.

00:48:42.164 --> 00:48:51.866
You think yourself to be responsible for the construction
of the whole world,

00:48:51.933 --> 00:48:54.653
it's not only a few people.

00:48:54.971 --> 00:48:59.694
You are very intelligent, knowledgeable and understanding.

00:48:59.789 --> 00:49:04.405
You are not like the Disciples of Christ who were not educated,

00:49:04.432 --> 00:49:12.327
who didn't understand so much and
who did get realization but were not of your level.

00:49:12.981 --> 00:49:21.152
Whatever they could do reached to a point
where this kind of a mess of a Christianity has come,

00:49:21.556 --> 00:49:24.488
but you can't create that kind.

00:49:24.572 --> 00:49:34.595
You will create a new vibrant religion which is global.

00:49:34.816 --> 00:49:41.108
I was very happy to see that now
we have people from all over the world.

00:49:41.354 --> 00:49:43.980
It’s a global movement all over.

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:51.559
It has nothing to do with the limited ideas of so called religions.

00:49:51.845 --> 00:49:54.956
They have ruined every religion.

00:49:54.995 --> 00:50:03.220
Islam is ruined, Christianity ruined,
and Hinduism ruined, and Buddhism the worst.

00:50:03.733 --> 00:50:06.763
In Buddhism you give up everything -

00:50:06.938 --> 00:50:14.216
all your belongings, all your property, give to the guru, imagine!

00:50:14.645 --> 00:50:22.133
And the guru is so greedy horrible fellow.

00:50:22.972 --> 00:50:29.528
How can he give resurrection?
Himself is a greedy fellow,

00:50:29.743 --> 00:50:35.606
misleading others just taking away everything.

00:50:36.633 --> 00:50:40.194
Then same thing about Christianity

00:50:40.297 --> 00:50:43.300
that you all become Nuns,
you become Fathers, you become

00:50:43.325 --> 00:50:47.078
Brothers and I don’t know, all nonsense.

00:50:47.335 --> 00:50:50.855
But there's no change within.

00:50:52.156 --> 00:50:58.265
Somebody came to Me and I said, “Why did you become a priest?”

00:50:58.354 --> 00:51:01.064
He said, “Because I was jobless.

00:51:02.421 --> 00:51:04.166
I had no job.”

00:51:04.166 --> 00:51:05.166
Baba?

00:51:05.166 --> 00:51:07.608
“So I took up the job of a priest.”

00:51:07.687 --> 00:51:09.147
Can you imagine?

00:51:09.785 --> 00:51:16.712
He could not fit into any job, so the minimum of minimum
he took is this job.

00:51:17.039 --> 00:51:19.269
Then what did you do?

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:25.913
“They told me what I have to preach and first I had to practice

00:51:26.331 --> 00:51:30.823
and remember it by heart, and then I don't know,

00:51:30.947 --> 00:51:37.859
I started talking this, talking that.”
I said he must be a big possessed man.

00:51:38.026 --> 00:51:43.495
He had no mind of his own; he didn't know what he was talking.

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:50.296
He would take out one sentence from Bible
and go on talking, boring everybody.

00:51:50.477 --> 00:51:57.708
And I was surprised that within fifteen minutes
people wanted to get out of the church.

00:51:58.074 --> 00:52:05.581
As soon as the sermon was over they would run out
and breathe, “Thank God.”

00:52:06.335 --> 00:52:10.318
Is that what religion gives you?

00:52:10.533 --> 00:52:13.186
Is that what should happen to you?

00:52:13.305 --> 00:52:16.189
No, it's not that.

00:52:16.333 --> 00:52:22.496
What happens to you that
you enjoy yourself, you enjoy the collectivity,

00:52:22.521 --> 00:52:24.795
you enjoy the goodness, the morality.

00:52:24.795 --> 00:52:30.878
The whole thing is like the nectar of life.

00:52:32.057 --> 00:52:36.616
So that changes the whole picture.

00:52:37.163 --> 00:52:43.916
The ritualism is so much; in the Hindu religion
there is too much of ritualism.

00:52:44.173 --> 00:52:51.670
You sit on the right or you sit on the left;
you do this at this time I mean, lots of it.

00:52:51.834 --> 00:52:56.668
That when your sister dies how many days you should starve yourself;

00:52:56.693 --> 00:53:00.085
if your husband dies then how many days?

00:53:01.019 --> 00:53:06.407
Dies is died, finished; the body’s finished now.

00:53:06.778 --> 00:53:11.129
So you fast for so many days - is very wrong,

00:53:11.154 --> 00:53:14.840
because you’re fasting the bhoot might come in to you.

00:53:17.846 --> 00:53:23.589
But still, what I would say all these ritualisms and all that,

00:53:23.729 --> 00:53:32.181
are created by human beings
who were claiming to be something great.

00:53:32.369 --> 00:53:39.493
They are not; by no means they are the people in charge of morality,

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:44.483
in charge of higher life.

00:53:45.054 --> 00:53:50.597
They lead such a mundane useless life.

00:53:52.682 --> 00:53:55.876
I went to a temple of Shri Ganesha,

00:53:55.960 --> 00:54:02.000
which is supposed to be Swayambhu,
one of the eight temples; it is one of them.

00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:06.977
And I was surprised.

00:54:07.002 --> 00:54:16.225
The man who was worshipping was supposed to be the priest,
he was suffering from paralysis,

00:54:16.799 --> 00:54:24.319
and his brother died of paralysis, now his son was also paralyzed.

00:54:24.605 --> 00:54:27.733
He said, “What is this Ganesha doing to us Mother?”

00:54:27.758 --> 00:54:31.268
I said, “What are you doing to Ganesha?

00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:35.540
How much money you earn out of it?”

00:54:35.643 --> 00:54:38.252
He said, “Quite a lot.”

00:54:38.514 --> 00:54:40.769
“And then what do you do with this money?

00:54:40.794 --> 00:54:43.638
Do you do anything for the society?

00:54:43.663 --> 00:54:46.188
Do you try to improve their lives?

00:54:46.213 --> 00:54:52.750
Have you any attention on the society
or you are just ooking after yourself?”

00:54:52.905 --> 00:54:59.377
As a result, he’s got paralysis,
his brother got paralysis, son got paralysis.

00:54:59.776 --> 00:55:03.422
And he was blaming Ganesha for that.

00:55:03.922 --> 00:55:08.664
He said, “Is it a real Ganesha?”
“Yes it is, but you are not.

00:55:08.974 --> 00:55:12.050
You don't deserve.”
I told him off on his face.

00:55:12.193 --> 00:55:15.624
He said, “All right you may say whatever you like but You cure me.”

00:55:15.743 --> 00:55:21.011
I said, “First promise that whatever money you get out of this temple

00:55:21.036 --> 00:55:25.855
you will spend it for the betterment of people.”

00:55:26.814 --> 00:55:29.845
But how can they?

00:55:31.289 --> 00:55:33.669
They are not realized souls.

00:55:33.772 --> 00:55:39.042
Such a lot of priests I see walking about with all this funny dresses.

00:55:39.082 --> 00:55:40.082
What?

00:55:40.273 --> 00:55:47.402
These are like dead bodies,
walking around with all kinds bad vibrations.

00:55:48.228 --> 00:55:50.423
I can't understand.

00:55:50.691 --> 00:55:56.651
And the other people are very simple,
they say, "Oh my goodness, see now he’s a priest."

00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:58.723
So they must respect.

00:55:58.748 --> 00:56:02.460
But, they don't see it; they do not ascertain

00:56:02.485 --> 00:56:10.085
what is the spiritual value of that person
who calls himself as the priest.

00:56:11.499 --> 00:56:13.629
That is your job.

00:56:13.732 --> 00:56:15.351
You don't have to fight with them.

00:56:15.376 --> 00:56:17.225
You don't have to denounce them.

00:56:17.225 --> 00:56:20.346
You don't have to describe them.

00:56:20.346 --> 00:56:24.186
No need, but understand that you are different.

00:56:24.186 --> 00:56:28.061
You have the right. You are the authority

00:56:28.275 --> 00:56:31.430
and so with that authority and confidence

00:56:31.455 --> 00:56:34.525
you have to go about and save people.

00:56:34.525 --> 00:56:37.974
You are realized souls.

00:56:38.127 --> 00:56:40.828
You got your resurrection.

00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:46.890
You are yogis; I agree, but what is your job?

00:56:47.176 --> 00:56:49.567
Why, why this has happened?

00:56:49.654 --> 00:56:56.447
Why this light has come in to you is to take the blind

00:56:57.106 --> 00:57:02.387
in your hands and take them towards the light.

00:57:02.625 --> 00:57:06.502
This is what is your resurrection for.

00:57:06.677 --> 00:57:16.012
It's not only for your seeking but also is the grace of the Divine,

00:57:16.126 --> 00:57:21.194
for you to make the whole world Divine, as far as possible.

00:57:21.279 --> 00:57:24.218
How many people have you given realization?

00:57:24.298 --> 00:57:26.332
How many people you have talked to them?

00:57:26.357 --> 00:57:29.759
I tell you I was surprised; once I was traveling by plane

00:57:29.879 --> 00:57:33.403
and there was some lady traveling with Me

00:57:33.428 --> 00:57:38.351
and she started talking to Me about her cult, about her nonsense.

00:57:38.376 --> 00:57:42.008
So look at it, shamelessly she was talking.

00:57:42.285 --> 00:57:47.833
Listening to her I said, Sahaja Yogis won't,
they won't talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:48.060 --> 00:57:53.824
Every person who is a Sahaja Yogi has to talk about Sahaja Yoga,

00:57:54.014 --> 00:57:58.342
may not be with the wrong type but with the right type of people.

00:57:58.854 --> 00:58:03.236
That's a thing you have to do. That's why you are enlightened.

00:58:03.603 --> 00:58:08.389
You are not enlightened to be put somewhere in the forest

00:58:08.897 --> 00:58:11.832
or to be lost to the whole world.

00:58:11.857 --> 00:58:17.706
You are enlightened; you are resurrected to enlighten other people.

00:58:17.816 --> 00:58:21.145
That's what you are there for

00:58:21.709 --> 00:58:24.299
and you can do it. Many have done it.

00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:26.661
So many of you have done it,

00:58:26.716 --> 00:58:33.310
and I would say that all of you, whether
you are a man or a woman, you have to do it.

00:58:34.993 --> 00:58:45.456
And that's the request of your Mother - t
hat make use of your realization.

00:58:46.094 --> 00:58:52.559
And the attention should be only on realization.

00:58:52.944 --> 00:58:58.097
How many people you are going to give realization to?

00:58:58.334 --> 00:59:02.221
How many people you are going to save?

00:59:03.102 --> 00:59:06.166
Is a very simple job for you.

00:59:06.223 --> 00:59:08.204
You have to just raise the Kundalini.

00:59:08.302 --> 00:59:09.352
You can.

00:59:09.495 --> 00:59:14.011
You should see how just with your hand
you can raise the Kundalini of others

00:59:14.036 --> 00:59:16.716
and give them their resurrection.

00:59:17.118 --> 00:59:19.364
You don't have to do anything.

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:22.633
The life is not that difficult for you.

00:59:22.672 --> 00:59:26.831
Your job is the easiest thing; it’s just to raise your hand.

00:59:26.856 --> 00:59:29.307
In hand, in your hand you have the power,

00:59:29.382 --> 00:59:38.185
just to raise your hand and give them realization,
instead of feeling diffident.

00:59:39.582 --> 00:59:44.100
That's why I would say you are all resurrected,

00:59:44.188 --> 00:59:47.041
you are all realized souls,

00:59:47.209 --> 00:59:51.278
and you have to create the Divine paradise on this earth.
