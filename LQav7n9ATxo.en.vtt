Shri Mahavira Jayanti Puja 28 mei 1991, Gidgegannup, Perth, Australië

00:00:02.254 --> 00:00:07.894
Today we are going to celebrate the

00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:12.453
birthday of Mahavira.

00:00:16.213 --> 00:00:22.613
Mahavira is the incarnation of Bhairavanath,

00:00:23.293 --> 00:00:27.653
or you call Him as Saint Michael.

00:00:28.293 --> 00:00:31.493
Now these two saints as you know

00:00:31.613 --> 00:00:34.133
one as the Gabriel, Hanumana,

00:00:34.693 --> 00:00:39.493
and another is Saint Michael.

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:44.373
One is placed on the Pingala Nadi

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:49.293
and another one, Saint Michael, on the Ida Nadi.

00:00:52.693 --> 00:00:54.373
So,

00:00:56.493 --> 00:00:59.893
Mahavira

00:01:01.693 --> 00:01:04.733
had to go through

00:01:05.053 --> 00:01:09.973
lots of search.

00:01:10.773 --> 00:01:15.253
Of course He was a

00:01:17.653 --> 00:01:21.053
angel, but came as human being

00:01:21.773 --> 00:01:26.093
and He had to find out

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:33.853
the thing of the left side,

00:01:35.973 --> 00:01:38.893
and how the left side acts.

00:01:39.853 --> 00:01:45.693
It's a very complicated thing, left side,

00:01:45.893 --> 00:01:49.733
is much more complicated than right side.

00:01:50.213 --> 00:01:56.253
On the left side we have also seven nadis,

00:01:56.693 --> 00:02:05.453
and these seven nadis are placed one after another.

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:10.093
They are described in books and given different names to them.

00:02:10.613 --> 00:02:15.733
Now these seven nadis that are on the left side,

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:19.933
as you know, they cater to our past.

00:02:20.053 --> 00:02:24.813
Say for example, every moment becomes a past.

00:02:25.813 --> 00:02:29.453
Every present becomes a past.

00:02:30.453 --> 00:02:34.373
Then we have past of this lifetime,

00:02:35.053 --> 00:02:38.773
and also we have past of our previous lives.

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:42.493
Then all the past is built in within us

00:02:42.613 --> 00:02:44.893
since our creation.

00:02:45.613 --> 00:02:48.453
So all the psychosomatic diseases, as you know,

00:02:48.573 --> 00:02:52.293
are only triggered by

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.733
the entities that appear

00:02:55.853 --> 00:02:57.813
from the left side.

00:02:58.413 --> 00:03:03.213
For a person, supposing he is suffering, say, from liver trouble

00:03:04.573 --> 00:03:07.893
and suddenly he's attacked from the left side,

00:03:08.893 --> 00:03:10.693
specially Mooladhara,

00:03:12.373 --> 00:03:15.773
or any left side, left Nabhi,

00:03:17.093 --> 00:03:20.973
because Mooladhara is the only one that is connected

00:03:21.213 --> 00:03:24.173
with the left side, Ida Nadi,

00:03:24.453 --> 00:03:29.453
and the right side PingalaNadi is connected with Swadisthana.

00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:36.333
So the problems of Mooladhara

00:03:38.013 --> 00:03:42.653
are really beyond the reach of human beings,

00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:45.053
and when it is attacked,

00:03:45.173 --> 00:03:48.693
any one of these chakras on the left-hand side,

00:03:50.493 --> 00:03:53.573
then psychosomatic diseases

00:03:54.493 --> 00:03:57.053
occur into human beings.

00:03:57.173 --> 00:03:59.733
As I have told you many-a-times, now this is the center,

00:03:59.853 --> 00:04:04.173
this is the another center, left and
right, they are on top of each other.

00:04:04.293 --> 00:04:06.573
And using the right side too much,

00:04:06.693 --> 00:04:09.053
goes up to a point and suddenly something happens

00:04:09.173 --> 00:04:11.253
on the left, triggers.

00:04:11.373 --> 00:04:16.853
So all diseases, say even diabetes,

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:21.053
is due to the psychosomatic efect.

00:04:21.853 --> 00:04:24.493
A person who is very hard-working, thinks too much,

00:04:24.613 --> 00:04:25.933
very right-sided,

00:04:26.053 --> 00:04:27.773
suddenly something happens,

00:04:27.893 --> 00:04:30.773
maybe also he might inherit that diabetes

00:04:30.973 --> 00:04:33.493
because of the past, and it triggers

00:04:33.613 --> 00:04:36.573
and you get this psychosomatic problem.

00:04:37.493 --> 00:04:40.373
Now this psychosomatic problem

00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:47.093
is only cured if you know what's the problem of the left side is.

00:04:49.693 --> 00:04:54.213
So Mahavira went quite deep on to the left side.

00:04:54.733 --> 00:04:58.333
Why I said it's difficult the left side is, because

00:04:58.453 --> 00:05:01.253
when you start moving on the left side

00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:04.893
the movement becomes linear of course,

00:05:05.013 --> 00:05:07.813
but it moves downward,

00:05:08.373 --> 00:05:12.533
while the movement on the right side moves upward.

00:05:12.693 --> 00:05:17.133
So the movement goes down like that,

00:05:18.013 --> 00:05:22.973
and then it coils up,

00:05:23.853 --> 00:05:26.653
forms coils,

00:05:26.813 --> 00:05:28.853
and you go on moving with it

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:32.413
so you are lost in the coil.

00:05:32.853 --> 00:05:36.293
But the other one moves upward

00:05:36.413 --> 00:05:38.973
and the coils are not so many,

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:43.173
and because it is upward it's easy to get out of it.

00:05:45.613 --> 00:05:48.533
So those people who go to the left,

00:05:48.653 --> 00:05:52.573
by any chance, by thinking too much about their past,

00:05:52.693 --> 00:05:56.933
crying about themselves and always complaining,

00:05:57.693 --> 00:06:01.773
are more difficult than the people on the right side.

00:06:02.773 --> 00:06:05.693
But the right side people are troublesome to others,

00:06:05.813 --> 00:06:09.333
while the left side people are troublesome to themselves.

00:06:09.813 --> 00:06:12.253
That's how this left side

00:06:12.373 --> 00:06:16.413
was to be found out properly, was done by Mahavira.

00:06:16.973 --> 00:06:19.973
Of course He knew also, I think, all about it.

00:06:20.293 --> 00:06:26.013
So He has mentioned practically,

00:06:26.173 --> 00:06:29.773
in details, lots of things that can happen to a person

00:06:29.893 --> 00:06:32.013
who goes to the left side.

00:06:32.133 --> 00:06:35.133
He gave the idea of hell.

00:06:36.053 --> 00:06:39.973
He also described seven types of hell.

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:43.533
I mean it's so horrible that I don't want to tell you

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.813
what is hell is,

00:06:45.933 --> 00:06:47.973
horrifyingly cruel,

00:06:48.573 --> 00:06:50.853
horrifyingly joyless

00:06:50.973 --> 00:06:57.813
and horrifyingly so repulsive that

00:06:57.933 --> 00:07:00.453
you hate yourself when you understand

00:07:00.573 --> 00:07:02.493
you have committed this mistake,

00:07:02.613 --> 00:07:06.213
you have committed this pap,  this

00:07:08.573 --> 00:07:09.573
sin;

00:07:09.693 --> 00:07:13.373
and then what is the result,

00:07:13.493 --> 00:07:15.533
what you get - the punishment part.

00:07:16.213 --> 00:07:18.453
Mahavira worked it out everything,

00:07:18.573 --> 00:07:22.773
He has given in all details what sort of punishment

00:07:22.893 --> 00:07:27.293
is due to a human being who tries to be left-sided.

00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:32.413
Also He has given about the person who is right-sided,

00:07:32.653 --> 00:07:34.293
but not to that extent

00:07:34.413 --> 00:07:36.853
because He had to deal with the combination,

00:07:36.973 --> 00:07:39.373
but mostly with the left side.

00:07:39.773 --> 00:07:44.573
As I have told many people before and here also I perhaps maybe,

00:07:45.133 --> 00:07:49.733
that there is a soul that is

00:07:49.853 --> 00:07:53.693
made out of the causal bodies

00:07:54.413 --> 00:07:58.333
of all the five elements.

00:07:58.453 --> 00:08:03.533
The causal, say for example, of the earth is fragrance.

00:08:03.813 --> 00:08:05.693
So this

00:08:08.453 --> 00:08:12.053
soul which is made of the five causal bodies

00:08:12.173 --> 00:08:14.373
and your centers,

00:08:14.493 --> 00:08:20.053
plus we can say, also

00:08:22.213 --> 00:08:28.093
it has got the control over the parasympathetic,

00:08:30.133 --> 00:08:37.053
it sits on the spinal cord from outside

00:08:37.213 --> 00:08:41.773
and activates the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:08:42.653 --> 00:08:46.773
So it has a connection with every center.

00:08:49.053 --> 00:08:51.933
Now this is the soul when we die,

00:08:52.293 --> 00:09:01.333
with the Kundalini and our Spirit goes into the sky

00:09:01.533 --> 00:09:05.253
and it is the soul that guides now

00:09:05.413 --> 00:09:09.853
the movement of our being, whatever is left now

00:09:09.973 --> 00:09:13.333
into a new being and that's how it works out.

00:09:13.453 --> 00:09:16.373
So everything that we have done so far

00:09:16.493 --> 00:09:19.213
is recorded in that soul.

00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:23.053
When you were asking Me, "Mother, we see some sort of

00:09:23.173 --> 00:09:26.573
round, round things, you see, lying together.

00:09:26.693 --> 00:09:28.013
What is that?"

00:09:28.133 --> 00:09:31.933
I told you this is our, this is a dead soul.

00:09:32.173 --> 00:09:37.733
And now they have found out what I have told them.

00:09:37.853 --> 00:09:42.733
Because, you see, when a person dies

00:09:43.053 --> 00:09:47.733
his soul shows you - like even now you can see,

00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:49.973
round, round things:

00:09:50.093 --> 00:09:55.733
there could be many, there could be one, a string -

00:09:56.813 --> 00:10:01.373
and they saw it under a microscope when I told them,

00:10:01.653 --> 00:10:09.773
that the soul within us is reflected on the cell,

00:10:09.933 --> 00:10:14.693
which is the reflector of every cell.

00:10:14.813 --> 00:10:18.853
So the part of the cell which is the reflector,

00:10:19.093 --> 00:10:27.613
which is placed on one side of the cell

00:10:28.213 --> 00:10:35.173
also has this soul reflected,

00:10:35.493 --> 00:10:40.173
and the main soul which is on the back

00:10:40.293 --> 00:10:43.853
controls that

00:10:47.133 --> 00:10:52.013
reflected soul which looks after every cell.

00:10:52.413 --> 00:10:57.293
Now they have found out that there is in that reflector

00:10:57.413 --> 00:11:01.053
this kind of seven loops,

00:11:01.253 --> 00:11:05.453
seven loops because it sits on the eight –

00:11:05.573 --> 00:11:10.013
seven chakras and the Mooladhara.

00:11:10.933 --> 00:11:15.413
Now what He found out that, when people die

00:11:15.613 --> 00:11:18.293
then some of the souls

00:11:20.453 --> 00:11:27.733
are born again just after few days,

00:11:27.893 --> 00:11:31.853
and these people are just very ordinary type of people,

00:11:32.013 --> 00:11:36.253
that's how He brought in a kind of category.

00:11:36.693 --> 00:11:40.173
So they are - the people who have died -

00:11:40.293 --> 00:11:44.173
they are of a category, one category,

00:11:44.333 --> 00:11:51.093
where they exist for a very short time

00:11:51.213 --> 00:11:53.733
in the collective subconscious

00:11:53.853 --> 00:12:02.133
and then they take their rebirth.

00:12:02.693 --> 00:12:04.613
They are very ordinary people,

00:12:04.733 --> 00:12:08.293
aimless, useless people.

00:12:08.533 --> 00:12:11.013
But there are some souls when they die,

00:12:11.133 --> 00:12:13.413
they just hang in the air

00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:16.533
and they are just waiting to find out somebody

00:12:16.653 --> 00:12:20.293
who will fulfill their desires

00:12:20.413 --> 00:12:24.013
which are not yet fulfilled.

00:12:24.893 --> 00:12:27.693
Like there's a drunkard and a drunkard,

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:32.733
can join another human being who's living,

00:12:32.853 --> 00:12:34.693
who would like to drink.

00:12:34.813 --> 00:12:38.293
So once he starts getting this...

00:13:01.613 --> 00:13:04.253
So once it starts

00:13:14.173 --> 00:13:21.733
getting into the habit of drinking,

00:13:22.493 --> 00:13:25.893
some of these souls can just jump on that person,

00:13:26.053 --> 00:13:28.813
and when they jump on that person

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:32.853
they can make him a real drunkard.

00:13:33.413 --> 00:13:36.693
I remember of a lady who was a very short, petite person,

00:13:36.813 --> 00:13:38.173
came from Cuba,

00:13:38.293 --> 00:13:40.693
in America when I went first,

00:13:40.813 --> 00:13:44.533
and she told Me that she's very sick of herself.

00:13:44.653 --> 00:13:46.973
And her husband told Me that she can take

00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:52.613
one whisky bottle, full, neat sometimes.

00:13:52.813 --> 00:13:56.813
Looked at her, such a little thing. I said "How can she do it?"

00:13:57.133 --> 00:14:04.733
So, I put a bandhan on her and I saw a huge big Negro

00:14:04.853 --> 00:14:06.693
standing behind her.

00:14:06.813 --> 00:14:08.693
So I said, "Do you know some Negro?"

00:14:08.813 --> 00:14:10.733
Immediately she jumped on Me. She said,

00:14:10.853 --> 00:14:12.613
"Mother, You see that one?

00:14:12.733 --> 00:14:15.813
You see that one, that's the one drinks, not me."

00:14:16.813 --> 00:14:19.173
Of course I cured her

00:14:19.293 --> 00:14:22.253
and after that she gave up drinking completely.

00:14:22.573 --> 00:14:29.653
So whenever you start getting into a habit in a bad way,

00:14:30.093 --> 00:14:33.333
you lose complete control of yourself

00:14:33.453 --> 00:14:38.933
and a spirit sits on you, and it controls you.

00:14:40.133 --> 00:14:42.893
And when it controls you,

00:14:43.013 --> 00:14:46.773
you do not know how to get rid of any habit.

00:14:46.893 --> 00:14:49.453
That's why it's difficult to get rid of habits.

00:14:49.573 --> 00:14:53.333
Now in Sahaja Yoga when the Kundalini rises what happens

00:14:54.013 --> 00:14:57.813
that these spirits, these dead spirits

00:14:57.933 --> 00:15:01.053
leave you and you become all right and you give up.

00:15:01.173 --> 00:15:04.493
That's how it works.

00:15:07.293 --> 00:15:10.733
I would say that all this Mahavira did not tell,

00:15:10.853 --> 00:15:13.693
nor did He find out all these things,

00:15:13.813 --> 00:15:16.933
because He was not a scientist, I think, or I don't know why.

00:15:17.053 --> 00:15:20.173
But what He has talked about is the hell.

00:15:20.293 --> 00:15:24.973
And He has said that if you do this kind of thing

00:15:25.093 --> 00:15:29.053
in your lifetime, then what kind of a hell you'll get,

00:15:29.853 --> 00:15:34.373
and He has described the hell in a very,

00:15:36.653 --> 00:15:40.813
I should say, openly and in a very detailed manner.

00:15:40.933 --> 00:15:43.733
And it's really horrible to know

00:15:43.853 --> 00:15:46.653
that a human being who thinks no end of himself

00:15:46.773 --> 00:15:49.413
ultimately will get to that kind of a hell

00:15:49.533 --> 00:15:53.173
and some are permanently doomed to be there.

00:15:54.413 --> 00:15:56.493
But as incarnations take birth,

00:15:56.613 --> 00:15:58.413
also these devils, some of them

00:15:58.533 --> 00:16:02.293
who are completely doomed to live in hell,

00:16:02.493 --> 00:16:05.093
also take their birth.

00:16:05.213 --> 00:16:09.813
And when they take their birth, they try to trouble us,

00:16:09.933 --> 00:16:13.133
and they can take birth as, as you know, as our gurus

00:16:13.253 --> 00:16:15.893
and things. And everything is happening now,

00:16:16.013 --> 00:16:19.893
you find it how these people are taking their birth

00:16:20.013 --> 00:16:22.373
and how they are misleading us.

00:16:22.493 --> 00:16:25.973
How they are using the left Swadisthana

00:16:26.093 --> 00:16:29.533
or we can call it the left side

00:16:29.653 --> 00:16:34.533
just to immobilize us completely.

00:16:35.013 --> 00:16:38.293
So when a person is possessed, as you must have seen,

00:16:38.413 --> 00:16:42.253
a person gets possessed he cannot feel vibrations -

00:16:42.373 --> 00:16:46.413
there are all kinds of symptoms about such a person.

00:16:46.533 --> 00:16:49.213
But in Sahaja Yoga what do we do

00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:51.013
is to take the name of Mahavira,

00:16:51.133 --> 00:16:56.333
because Mahavira runs all the way, all the way on the Ida Nadi

00:16:56.453 --> 00:17:01.493
and comes and stays here onto the -

00:17:02.133 --> 00:17:07.493
we can say the point which is for our superego.

00:17:07.813 --> 00:17:11.373
And it sees, controls, works out, cleanses

00:17:11.533 --> 00:17:13.533
and does all that is required

00:17:13.653 --> 00:17:16.773
to put a person right after Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:16.893 --> 00:17:19.973
So we have to be really very thankful to Him

00:17:20.093 --> 00:17:24.893
for doing this kind of work which is very filthy and dirty;

00:17:25.013 --> 00:17:27.653
because these people don't mind even

00:17:27.773 --> 00:17:30.773
sitting in the bathroom, like that you can say,

00:17:30.933 --> 00:17:33.653
or sitting with everything and meditating.

00:17:33.773 --> 00:17:36.293
They can do anything, they are very dirty people,

00:17:36.413 --> 00:17:37.693
absolutely dirty.

00:17:37.813 --> 00:17:41.373
When they become tantrikas they try all kinds of dirty things,

00:17:41.493 --> 00:17:45.053
and with that they actually create a problem

00:17:45.173 --> 00:17:48.533
between themselves and the God.

00:17:49.373 --> 00:17:52.173
Say they'll go to a temple of a Goddess

00:17:52.293 --> 00:17:54.733
and start misbehaving with a woman there,

00:17:54.853 --> 00:17:56.893
so the Goddess will disappear;

00:17:57.013 --> 00:17:59.373
and once the Goddess disappears in that area,

00:17:59.493 --> 00:18:02.853
they call all these bhoots from the left side.

00:18:02.973 --> 00:18:07.173
So now we have all these souls which are lying, hanging in the air,

00:18:07.293 --> 00:18:10.053
trying to come back

00:18:10.173 --> 00:18:16.573
to a conscious thing and to possess someone.

00:18:16.693 --> 00:18:20.573
Plus these, we have these masters of the left side

00:18:20.693 --> 00:18:23.933
who know how to catch hold of these people

00:18:24.053 --> 00:18:26.253
and put them on somebody,

00:18:26.373 --> 00:18:30.253
or to remove from them someone and to put somebody else.

00:18:30.373 --> 00:18:32.293
So it's a continuous process,

00:18:32.413 --> 00:18:37.493
and this makes a person absolutely mad and good for nothing.

00:18:38.453 --> 00:18:40.853
Now when we know all this,

00:18:40.973 --> 00:18:43.853
still we get caught up on the left side.

00:18:43.973 --> 00:18:46.373
Sahaja Yogis do get caught up.

00:18:46.693 --> 00:18:49.813
That's why I think this Mahavira Jayanti

00:18:49.933 --> 00:18:54.053
is a very, very great day for us to observe.

00:18:54.173 --> 00:18:56.653
Now why was He called Mahavira?

00:18:56.773 --> 00:19:02.733
Because only a person like Him - Vir means a person who is brave,

00:19:02.853 --> 00:19:07.093
who is chivalrous - because only He could do this.

00:19:07.213 --> 00:19:11.413
So only He could enter into the being fully

00:19:11.533 --> 00:19:17.173
and could kill or you can say destroy

00:19:17.293 --> 00:19:20.333
those horrible rakshasas, devils,

00:19:20.453 --> 00:19:23.853
all these negative things that come to us.

00:19:24.253 --> 00:19:26.733
Now as you know we use left side very much

00:19:26.853 --> 00:19:30.133
for so many negativity that is torturing us;

00:19:30.253 --> 00:19:33.013
but if there is no help,

00:19:33.133 --> 00:19:35.973
say, from Mahavira we cannot do it.

00:19:36.093 --> 00:19:38.093
We  call the name of Mahavira -

00:19:38.213 --> 00:19:41.133
you could call Him Saint Michael, you can call Him by any name,

00:19:41.253 --> 00:19:44.533
but Mahavira because He was a human being.

00:19:44.653 --> 00:19:47.893
All this works out because of Him

00:19:48.013 --> 00:19:50.173
and He is such a great identity.

00:19:50.293 --> 00:19:53.133
He, Himself took a birth as a human being.

00:19:53.253 --> 00:19:57.173
Difficult for saints to take birth as human being.

00:19:57.293 --> 00:20:01.293
Moreover, you see, the

00:20:01.493 --> 00:20:06.893
whole concept

00:20:07.653 --> 00:20:11.133
of hell and all that is described

00:20:11.253 --> 00:20:15.613
in any scripture is a fact: it exists.

00:20:16.373 --> 00:20:19.093
And if you try to go in there, you see,

00:20:19.213 --> 00:20:22.053
when I try to go there and to find out,

00:20:22.173 --> 00:20:25.893
I just go off to sleep sort of thing. In My sleep I find out

00:20:26.013 --> 00:20:28.373
all the things that are happening about a person,

00:20:28.493 --> 00:20:30.773
how much he's caught up, what he's done.

00:20:30.893 --> 00:20:34.893
It's a - not a easy thing to do with the conscious mind.

00:20:35.013 --> 00:20:37.213
You have to take to the subconscious

00:20:37.333 --> 00:20:40.093
and you have to go into sushupti, in a deeper sleep

00:20:40.213 --> 00:20:42.573
to see what's happening in the left side.

00:20:42.693 --> 00:20:46.933
It's a very funny situation, I think,

00:20:47.053 --> 00:20:51.013
and for Sahaja Yogis also to enter in it, I would not advise it.

00:20:51.133 --> 00:20:54.173
But one should get rid of the problems of the left side

00:20:54.293 --> 00:20:56.333
with the help of Mahavira.

00:20:56.453 --> 00:21:00.053
When this chakra is caught up what you find is a big

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:05.333
lump of bone coming out on the right side.

00:21:05.893 --> 00:21:08.653
So you have to take the name of Mahavira

00:21:08.773 --> 00:21:12.773
just to remove that pressure from the left side.

00:21:12.893 --> 00:21:15.773
Now many people do not even know why they suffer:

00:21:15.893 --> 00:21:18.613
Why should they suffer when they have done nothing wrong?

00:21:18.733 --> 00:21:21.773
Because they are possessed.

00:21:22.133 --> 00:21:24.973
Now even the viruses and all these things

00:21:25.093 --> 00:21:29.333
like psychosomatic troubles, like cancer -

00:21:29.453 --> 00:21:32.613
all, I would say the incurable diseases

00:21:32.733 --> 00:21:37.573
are there because we are triggered into the left side,

00:21:37.773 --> 00:21:41.053
and that's why we are suffering from these diseases

00:21:41.173 --> 00:21:43.773
which are not curable.

00:21:43.893 --> 00:21:46.893
So we have to thank really very much Mahavira

00:21:47.013 --> 00:21:49.413
who has given us this power

00:21:49.573 --> 00:21:52.253
to remove our left-sided problems,

00:21:52.373 --> 00:21:58.333
who has given us this light in our hand,

00:21:58.453 --> 00:22:01.613
which He Himself vibrates

00:22:01.733 --> 00:22:06.213
and He, Himself tries to throw some light

00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:10.773
on the obscure things - about Me also.

00:22:10.973 --> 00:22:14.933
Because of Him only

00:22:15.173 --> 00:22:19.013
we can get cured

00:22:19.213 --> 00:22:23.933
of so many physical and mental troubles.

00:22:24.053 --> 00:22:27.213
You know that the left side can be easily cured

00:22:27.333 --> 00:22:30.493
if you use three-candle treatment.

00:22:30.613 --> 00:22:34.333
That shows Mahavira is only fond of light,

00:22:34.453 --> 00:22:36.253
He doesn't like darkness.

00:22:36.373 --> 00:22:41.293
And His idea is, I think that way,

00:22:41.413 --> 00:22:46.373
is to now fully go all the way

00:22:46.493 --> 00:22:50.333
to clear the left side as far as possible,

00:22:50.453 --> 00:22:53.533
to help Sahaja Yoga to be established

00:22:53.653 --> 00:22:59.613
in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there,

00:23:00.133 --> 00:23:01.413
lot of it.

00:23:01.533 --> 00:23:03.893
So He is working it out, everywhere,

00:23:04.013 --> 00:23:07.053
and the psychosomatic diseases and all these diseases

00:23:07.173 --> 00:23:10.413
also we can work it out with candle light and all that,

00:23:10.533 --> 00:23:13.573
with three-candle we can do this treatment.

00:23:13.733 --> 00:23:17.773
So we have to be very thankful to Him

00:23:17.893 --> 00:23:21.493
that He has achieved this kind of entry

00:23:21.613 --> 00:23:24.653
into the left side and has found out for us

00:23:24.773 --> 00:23:30.013
what sort of problems exist on the left side.

00:23:32.813 --> 00:23:35.773
It's such a nice thing that we have got today the chance

00:23:35.893 --> 00:23:39.173
to celebrate His birthday here

00:23:39.293 --> 00:23:43.493
in a place which is really very much loved by Him.

00:23:43.613 --> 00:23:46.493
Now we may say that Mahavira is sometimes seen

00:23:46.613 --> 00:23:49.493
as a person who is naked.

00:23:49.613 --> 00:23:53.493
So it happened that He had gone in a jungle to meditate

00:23:53.613 --> 00:23:56.613
and to find out about the left side

00:23:56.733 --> 00:23:58.893
and when He got up, you see,

00:23:59.013 --> 00:24:03.373
He got caught up in one of the bushes

00:24:03.533 --> 00:24:11.453
and He had to torn off half part of that.

00:24:11.693 --> 00:24:16.213
When that half part was torn off,

00:24:16.333 --> 00:24:21.493
then He came out of those bushes and He was all right,

00:24:21.613 --> 00:24:25.173
but at the same time Shri Krishna appeared there on the scene

00:24:25.293 --> 00:24:27.853
as a little boy from a village

00:24:27.973 --> 00:24:30.973
and He said that "I'm a poor man,"

00:24:31.093 --> 00:24:34.373
this little boy said, "I am a poor person, I have nothing with Me.

00:24:34.493 --> 00:24:37.293
You are a king. You can always get your clothes.

00:24:37.413 --> 00:24:43.733
Why don't you give Me Your, this half cloth that You have?"

00:24:43.853 --> 00:24:50.653
And, they say so that it was given to this boy

00:24:50.773 --> 00:24:52.053
and who ran away.

00:24:52.173 --> 00:24:54.853
He was nobody else but Shri Vishnu.

00:24:56.653 --> 00:25:02.173
And this, you see, Vishnu took away that cloth

00:25:02.293 --> 00:25:05.773
and of hardly for about two seconds or three seconds

00:25:05.893 --> 00:25:07.733
because He was a king you see,

00:25:07.853 --> 00:25:09.653
and He hid Himself with leaves

00:25:09.773 --> 00:25:12.973
and He went to His palace and got dressed.

00:25:13.093 --> 00:25:15.693
But imagine, the people, how negative they are.

00:25:15.813 --> 00:25:19.693
They just walk without clothes - Jainies.

00:25:19.933 --> 00:25:24.093
They have, you see, all kinds of taboos

00:25:24.213 --> 00:25:27.813
against all the worms, everything.

00:25:28.173 --> 00:25:30.893
It's said, these people have started,

00:25:31.013 --> 00:25:33.973
that if you do not respect these little, little animals,

00:25:34.093 --> 00:25:39.693
like you can a, even serpent

00:25:39.813 --> 00:25:45.173
or any animal which is troublesome and bad,

00:25:45.293 --> 00:25:52.253
but is a living thing, so it's to be preserved.

00:25:52.453 --> 00:25:54.173
Now these Jains are mad.

00:25:54.293 --> 00:25:58.013
I told you that they have gone to such a limit of vegetarianism

00:25:58.133 --> 00:26:00.413
that they try to save even the bugs,

00:26:00.533 --> 00:26:02.693
put the bugs in a hut,

00:26:02.813 --> 00:26:07.133
and the hut has got a brahmin there.

00:26:07.253 --> 00:26:11.413
Now these bugs suck the blood of this brahmin

00:26:11.533 --> 00:26:15.173
and once the brahmin is

00:26:15.293 --> 00:26:17.533
completely, I mean I should say, sucked in

00:26:17.653 --> 00:26:20.613
by these bugs, they fall on the ground.

00:26:20.733 --> 00:26:23.453
Then they allow the brahmin to come out

00:26:23.573 --> 00:26:25.773
and they give him a lot of dakshina, means

00:26:25.893 --> 00:26:28.013
they give him money as a reward

00:26:28.133 --> 00:26:31.933
for helping the bugs to suck his blood.

00:26:32.053 --> 00:26:34.253
This kind of vegetarianism is there.

00:26:34.373 --> 00:26:37.973
Beware of vegetarians. You see even Hitler was a vegetarian

00:26:38.093 --> 00:26:41.013
so you can imagine what sort of a vegetarianism it is.

00:26:41.133 --> 00:26:44.013
All these fads of vegetarianism and all that

00:26:44.133 --> 00:26:46.253
are not at all required,

00:26:46.413 --> 00:26:51.293
and that's what Mahavira showed in His life,

00:26:51.413 --> 00:26:56.333
that it is not at all important to bother about food,

00:26:56.453 --> 00:26:59.333
what they should eat.

00:26:59.453 --> 00:27:04.173
See, the whole theory of this vegetarianism has gone

00:27:04.293 --> 00:27:09.693
to such a nonsensical limits that I have told people

00:27:09.813 --> 00:27:13.493
that we should give up vegetarianism, completely.

00:27:13.613 --> 00:27:18.613
Now also see the juxtaposition of what He wanted to do.

00:27:18.853 --> 00:27:23.173
If you do not eat proteins you cannot fight bhoots.

00:27:23.293 --> 00:27:26.373
A person who has bhoots in him must eat a lot of proteins,

00:27:26.493 --> 00:27:29.413
not carbohydrates but proteins, so that

00:27:29.533 --> 00:27:33.613
it can fight those left-sided enemies.

00:27:33.733 --> 00:27:36.933
But here it is they have to be vegetarians.

00:27:37.053 --> 00:27:40.373
Now imagine they have left-sided enemies within them

00:27:40.493 --> 00:27:42.213
and they want to be vegetarians.

00:27:42.333 --> 00:27:45.693
Finished. How will they fight it?

00:27:45.813 --> 00:27:49.253
So all this is all we should say is pre-planned

00:27:49.373 --> 00:27:54.173
by the person who tries to, sort of say is -

00:27:54.293 --> 00:27:57.253
we can say like that, you see, a person

00:27:57.373 --> 00:28:01.733
who tries to remove the -

00:28:04.493 --> 00:28:10.373
or we can say that the person who tries to make the,

00:28:10.493 --> 00:28:14.013
these lower animals live,

00:28:14.133 --> 00:28:16.773
rather than human beings, you see they're oppressors.

00:28:16.893 --> 00:28:18.693
This is the stupid thing they do.

00:28:18.813 --> 00:28:23.573
Must know that I cannot give Realization to these worms

00:28:23.693 --> 00:28:29.653
and to these fishes, or even to chickens.

00:28:30.053 --> 00:28:32.933
We require human beings.

00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:40.893
So all this has happened because of human beings

00:28:41.013 --> 00:28:44.933
going in juxtaposition of whatever is said.

00:28:45.053 --> 00:28:49.573
Like Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,"

00:28:49.733 --> 00:28:52.893
and I've yet to come across a Christian

00:28:53.013 --> 00:28:56.453
who is not a Sahaja Yogi, without adulterous eyes,

00:28:56.573 --> 00:28:59.493
whether it's a woman or a man.

00:29:00.813 --> 00:29:05.253
So we go just the opposite of what we have been taught.

00:29:05.373 --> 00:29:09.493
In the case of same thing happened that Mahavira,

00:29:09.613 --> 00:29:13.813
what He tried to do was absolutely killed

00:29:13.933 --> 00:29:17.773
by these people who are trying

00:29:17.893 --> 00:29:22.773
to make this vegetarianism as a big religion.

00:29:23.453 --> 00:29:27.533
Also another thing was that this vegetarianism

00:29:27.653 --> 00:29:32.053
came into Jainism through one fellow called Neminath

00:29:32.173 --> 00:29:37.613
who was a tirthankar at the time of Shri Krishna.

00:29:37.773 --> 00:29:40.453
He was to be married. In those days they were married,

00:29:40.573 --> 00:29:43.773
not only but they were eating all kinds of meats

00:29:43.893 --> 00:29:48.733
and so many lambs and goats came for the wedding of this man

00:29:48.853 --> 00:29:52.933
so he felt that - uparati we call it, this:

00:29:53.053 --> 00:29:56.573
he didn't like it, he was disgusted, he was frustrated with that.

00:29:56.693 --> 00:30:00.173
With that frustration what did he do?

00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:02.973
He said, "I will not eat meat."

00:30:03.093 --> 00:30:07.173
And that's how vegetarianism started among Jainies.

00:30:07.293 --> 00:30:09.613
And that's how it's still going on,

00:30:09.733 --> 00:30:14.733
and these Jainies I find are the
joyless people, absolutely joyless.

00:30:14.853 --> 00:30:18.533
They're so much fond of money, they run after the money

00:30:18.653 --> 00:30:22.093
and they go on behaving in such a peculiar way

00:30:22.213 --> 00:30:24.253
that you can't understand, I mean they are

00:30:24.373 --> 00:30:26.853
human beings but the way they behave you can't

00:30:26.973 --> 00:30:29.533
understand them, they're not normal people.

00:30:30.853 --> 00:30:35.253
So we realize that despite all that Mahavira worked out,

00:30:35.373 --> 00:30:42.893
still the people are supposed to be His disciples,

00:30:43.053 --> 00:30:46.053
they are Jains, and they are like this.

00:30:46.653 --> 00:30:49.653
So what we have to do now is to understand

00:30:49.773 --> 00:30:53.293
that in Sahaja Yoga we'd better not do something of that kind.

00:30:53.893 --> 00:30:57.738
Whatever you are told, you have to understand why it is so,

00:30:57.859 --> 00:30:59.468
you know the modus operandi,

00:30:59.589 --> 00:31:01.773
you know each and everything about Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:03.573
You know the whole subject

00:31:03.693 --> 00:31:07.333
so it's not proper for you to in any way,

00:31:07.453 --> 00:31:09.853
to succumb to any such arguments

00:31:09.973 --> 00:31:12.733
or any such big, big talks or big, big

00:31:12.853 --> 00:31:17.173
advertisement and take to something that is wrong.

00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:19.413
It's very important.

00:31:20.493 --> 00:31:24.293
We are Sahaja Yogis and we understand the balance.

00:31:24.453 --> 00:31:27.933
Of course I always say that Westerners for example,

00:31:28.093 --> 00:31:29.773
maybe Australians also,

00:31:29.893 --> 00:31:33.653
should take more to carbohydrates because they eat a lot of meat.

00:31:33.773 --> 00:31:35.693
So they can take to carbohydrates,

00:31:35.813 --> 00:31:38.373
but that doesn't mean vegetarianism by any chance.

00:31:38.493 --> 00:31:40.413
I mean, to compensate.

00:31:40.533 --> 00:31:44.133
And in India I always say they must take to more meats,

00:31:44.253 --> 00:31:46.053
as will do, do them good.

00:31:46.173 --> 00:31:50.733
But then by no means I say that you just eat meat and nothing else.

00:31:50.893 --> 00:31:53.213
But a balance has to be found out,

00:31:53.333 --> 00:31:55.013
and once you strike it

00:31:55.133 --> 00:32:00.053
then you'll be surprised that you'll feel so relaxed, so much better,

00:32:00.173 --> 00:32:02.493
so much enlightened

00:32:02.613 --> 00:32:06.253
and the vibrations will flow much better than normally.

00:32:06.413 --> 00:32:08.893
So for food, you have to be careful.

00:32:09.013 --> 00:32:10.813
Same about with clothes

00:32:10.933 --> 00:32:14.493
that you shouldn't go mad after a suit all the time

00:32:14.613 --> 00:32:17.853
whether it's hot or cold or indifferent.

00:32:17.973 --> 00:32:21.533
What you have to do is to wear something that will suit you.

00:32:21.653 --> 00:32:23.693
Now for example, in a climate like this

00:32:23.813 --> 00:32:27.413
you may require a suit or something to cover yourself,

00:32:27.533 --> 00:32:29.893
but supposing you are in Ganapatipule

00:32:30.013 --> 00:32:33.573
or some place like that where it's not so cold

00:32:33.693 --> 00:32:36.453
or so hot, maybe it's dry.

00:32:36.573 --> 00:32:39.813
So what sort of a dress you should wear which is comfortable,

00:32:39.933 --> 00:32:42.893
that should be found out. And whatever you find out

00:32:43.013 --> 00:32:45.293
that this is such a comfortable dress for us,

00:32:45.413 --> 00:32:47.213
you'd better do it.

00:32:47.333 --> 00:32:52.813
Because what I have seen in many - you see, it's a thing that

00:32:52.933 --> 00:32:54.853
whenever I tell you something,

00:32:54.973 --> 00:32:57.133
don't take it to the extremes

00:32:57.253 --> 00:32:59.053
and don't take a little bit of it.

00:32:59.173 --> 00:33:02.653
But when I tell you this thing, you must understand

00:33:02.813 --> 00:33:05.933
that whatever is good for you,

00:33:06.053 --> 00:33:10.773
whatever is your temperament, whatever is aptitude,

00:33:10.893 --> 00:33:14.413
you have to take something that will nourish that,

00:33:14.533 --> 00:33:17.533
that will improve you and give you a balance.

00:33:17.653 --> 00:33:20.973
So to balance yourself, if you think of Mahavira

00:33:21.093 --> 00:33:24.733
you must think also of Shri Hanumana,

00:33:24.853 --> 00:33:27.813
both these things are important.

00:33:27.933 --> 00:33:31.733
It's not easy to tell all about Mahavira in this short lecture,

00:33:31.853 --> 00:33:36.093
but I think I have quite connected Him now with Sahaj,

00:33:36.213 --> 00:33:39.693
and you must have seen to it that how important He is

00:33:39.813 --> 00:33:42.133
and what an important role He plays.

00:33:42.693 --> 00:33:45.493
So May God bless you.

00:33:45.853 --> 00:33:49.053
Just start thinking about Mahavira I just,

00:33:49.373 --> 00:33:52.453
it's impossible to keep into the conscious mind,

00:33:52.573 --> 00:33:54.733
it's just going into the left all the time.

00:33:54.853 --> 00:33:58.173
Because I just in the car thought I'd better think about Mahavira

00:33:58.293 --> 00:34:01.893
and since then it's all going towards the left, it's so difficult.

00:34:02.013 --> 00:34:05.453
But it will work out.

00:34:24.573 --> 00:34:26.413
May God bless you!
