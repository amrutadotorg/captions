00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:20.067
Pranavasya, Parabrahmarishi, Paramatma, Devata Devi, Gayatri Chanda, Pranayame, Vineyoga

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:24.834
This is action, you see, so it’s right side, Pranayama

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:31.067
Just to put it

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:35.467
How you do it? Just tell them

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:37.734
What you do is you take your hand like this

00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:41.367
place these fingers on the left nostril

00:00:41.434 --> 00:00:46.501
breathe in through the right nostril

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:49.300
Hold it, for a short while

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:52.234
then put your thumb on your other nostril

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:59.267
and breathe out through the left nostril

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:04.534
Then breathe in through the left nostril

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:07.334
Hold it

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.400
and then breathe out through the right nostril

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:15.534
It should be done gently. You shouldn’t force it

00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:19.167
Once or twice is- Thrice, Thrice

00:01:19.234 --> 00:01:23.334
Let’s put right hand on the [nostril]

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.334
First put the right hand on the-.....No. Right [thumb].

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.734
Right thumb on the right nostril

00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:44.701
breathe in through the left. Follow Shri Mataji as She is

00:01:44.767 --> 00:01:56.400
And also, when you breathe out, keep it out for a while

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.133
Cleared out

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.334
It’s to clear out your sinuses and problems, you see, with your Vishuddhi. that Helps

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.167
It’s better now?

00:03:06.234 --> 00:03:10.801
Also Ida and Pingala get cleared out

00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:13.801
OM.

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:16.033
This is the great Gayatri Mantra, which-

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.767
This is right side. Right sided.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.267
And we refer to the seven main layers in the cosmos

00:03:22.334 --> 00:03:24.501
These are the seven names we take first

00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:26.000
Om Bhuh,

00:03:26.067 --> 00:03:27.367
Om Bhuvah,

00:03:27.434 --> 00:03:28.801
Om Swaha,

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:30.434
Om Mahah,

00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:31.767
Om Janah,

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:33.300
Om Tapah,

00:03:33.367 --> 00:03:34.667
Om Satyam,

00:03:34.734 --> 00:03:37.334
Om Tat savitur Vareṇyaṃ Bhargo-

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.834
Again, can I explain this?

00:03:39.067 --> 00:03:39.834
Yes, very much

00:03:40.067 --> 00:03:40.767
Bhu.

00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:42.400
First is Bhu.

00:03:42.467 --> 00:03:46.601
Bhu is the Earth, Mother Earth.

00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:49.434
Mooladhara

00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:50.667
What is the Second one?

00:03:50.734 --> 00:03:51.701
Bhuva.

00:03:51.767 --> 00:03:56.567
Bhuva is Antariksha, is whatever is created, whatever is created

00:03:56.634 --> 00:03:58.267
It is Swadishtan.

00:03:58.334 --> 00:03:59.634
Then?

00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:00.467
Swaha.

00:04:00.534 --> 00:04:03.267
Swaha is Nabhi because it consumes; consumers.

00:04:03.334 --> 00:04:06.400
Swaha is consumer, it consumes.

00:04:06.467 --> 00:04:07.667
Swaha.

00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:08.567
Mah.

00:04:08.634 --> 00:04:13.200
Maha is the Mother

00:04:13.267 --> 00:04:13.801
Janah

00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:14.767
Vishuddhi

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.567
The people.

00:04:15.634 --> 00:04:17.033
Janah.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.634
All the people.

00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:19.801
Collectivity.

00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:22.300
Tapah.

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:23.033
Means burning

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.534
This is the Penance

00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:31.601
Christ’s life was a tapah

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:35.767
And also, the Surya has got the light

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.501
The Surya also has got the fire

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:42.167
The heat is tapah.

00:04:42.234 --> 00:04:43.734
So, this is tapah.

00:04:43.801 --> 00:04:44.767
Then Satyam.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.501
At the Sahasrara, you know the truth.

00:04:48.567 --> 00:04:51.834
All right? These are the seven.

00:04:52.067 --> 00:04:53.200
Say it again ?

00:04:53.267 --> 00:05:02.434
Om Bhu, Om Bhuvah, Om Swaha, Om Mahah, Om Janah, Om Tapah, Om Satyam,

00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:09.534
Om Tat savitur Vareṇyaṃ Bhargo Devasya dhimahi dhiyo yonah prachodayat

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:16.200
Aum apo jyotiras’omrutam, Om Brahma Bhur Bhuvah Swarom
