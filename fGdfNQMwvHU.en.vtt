00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:14.297
Some other languages apart from,  in my country I know three, four.  

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:22.096
How many languages should I know? You tell me.  They do not say, or course, isn't it?

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:30.000
In Russia, from Japan, all over you see so many languages.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.445
But this Philip told me in Japan, the one who is the leader,

00:00:39.445 --> 00:00:42.709
 that they are not against us at all.

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:46.978
They are against this 'OM cult' which was there.

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:52.048
But as he said, "You are a family, you are not a cult".

00:00:52.893 --> 00:00:56.621
They are not against us in Japan. They are very anxious.

00:00:56.797 --> 00:01:01.089
 And also, they were&nbsp;
saying, "You should build a temple here of Mother". 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:02.745
I was surprised.

00:01:02.886 --> 00:01:09.550
They want to make a temple. I am still living and they want to make a temple already.

00:01:12.962 --> 00:01:17.878
You see, everybody is fed up of all this nonsense.

00:01:19.742 --> 00:01:27.764
When I went to Japan first, 'baba'
the whole was nothing but Geishas' houses. Geishas.

00:01:29.171 --> 00:01:34.069
So, the people were there, from my&nbsp;
husband's office people,

00:01:34.342 --> 00:01:39.523
they said, "Where to take you? There are only Geishas' houses". So, I said, "Take me to Geishas' houses". 

00:01:39.804 --> 00:01:43.145
"So, how can you go to Geishas ?", they burst out. 

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:46.493
"If you can go, I can also. What's wrong?"

00:01:46.985 --> 00:01:53.868
So, we went there; of course, they told us about them 
how they laugh and this, that.

00:01:54.262 --> 00:01:58.046
So, the Geisha - I had lots of bangles on me.

00:01:58.046 --> 00:02:04.775
So, she looked at them, she said, "It makes a very beautiful sound" I said, "Yes. You want it?" 

00:02:04.775 --> 00:02:08.882
She said, "Yes". They said, "NO!" All of them.

00:02:08.882 --> 00:02:16.824
"No, how can you give her them?" I said, "Why?" "They are not auspicious people". 

00:02:17.176 --> 00:02:23.676
I was surprised: they knew that doing this Geishas' work is not auspicious. 

00:02:24.098 --> 00:02:29.277
You see, so there's already 'dharma' within you, 
the religion is within you. 

00:02:29.277 --> 00:02:36.557
They wouldn't allow me and&nbsp;they told, 
"Don't touch them, you are pure ladies, you don't touch them".

00:02:37.613 --> 00:02:45.822
They are very normal women, you know. They came&nbsp;
and give us food and very properly dressed&nbsp;also.

00:02:46.455 --> 00:02:56.866
But I was surprised at the Japanese, how they understood the importance of pure life.

00:03:13.277 --> 00:03:17.122
Where are you all staying? 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.330
All here, Shri Mataji, in this hotel, all of us, the same hotel Shri Mataji.

00:03:21.506 --> 00:03:24.670
-Where? 
-All of us in the same hotel here.

00:03:24.916 --> 00:03:27.931
-Same hotel? 
-Yes, we have differnt rooms.

00:03:27.931 --> 00:03:32.290
He is in another, he didn't know.

00:03:33.241 --> 00:03:37.761
Me and Heliopolis

00:04:07.076 --> 00:04:14.684
Ah! They gave this award to that man and he's&nbsp;
exposed in every newspaper! 

00:04:14.965 --> 00:04:22.082
Horrible things&nbsp;coming out of that! Even yesterday, there was some in the CNN,

00:04:22.082 --> 00:04:29.256
and&nbsp;the CNN people said that it was a very big mistake
 on part of these. 

00:04:29.256 --> 00:04:33.986
 And they said, "How could they give it to this man who was a criminal?"

00:04:33.986 --> 00:04:38.200
And all the Eastern countries, you see- do you all saw that? &nbsp;

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.399
No, I didn't see. I just hear now. 

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:45.073
-Right from Japan-
-I'm&nbsp;very happy hear. 
- To Australia have banned.&nbsp; 

00:04:45.073 --> 00:04:46.913
I'm very happy to hear that.

00:04:46.913 --> 00:04:53.199
It's very&nbsp;unusual, the whole thing is happening&nbsp;in such a way, you can't believe it. 

00:04:53.415 --> 00:05:01.368
Actually, you see, they don't believe in God.
They don't believe&nbsp;in spirituality. They can't understand&nbsp;

00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:10.000
Because when CP went there and gave me the&nbsp;book, there are 12 mayors of very different&nbsp;countries 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.313
who have said about it. 12 Mayors.
And also&nbsp;2 Prime Ministers of Canada.

00:05:18.594 --> 00:05:22.876
But still, they&nbsp;give it to this man.

00:05:23.123 --> 00:05:30.977
And one of them is a what you call, a self-exiled man. 

00:05:31.153 --> 00:05:38.861
He lives in Australia and the&nbsp;Australians told us
 that he's begging everywhere,&nbsp;asking for money, this thing.

00:05:39.084 --> 00:05:45.825
And also, their people were, one third,&nbsp;at the most,
were Christians. 

00:05:46.142 --> 00:05:54.517
So, the Catholic people&nbsp;is, they have converted, most 
of them, very few are&nbsp;left now, who are not converted.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:00.706
And so now they want a separate state for the Catholics.

00:06:00.881 --> 00:06:08.029
It's a, all a Catholic Church, sort of a, you can call the mafia - Catholic church. &nbsp;

00:06:08.346 --> 00:06:12.065
And just to oppose the Muslims.

00:06:12.065 --> 00:06:17.404
You&nbsp;see, if they go like this,
 the rift will be much more.

00:06:18.283 --> 00:06:28.513
This is not what the people of this award
 they should not have&nbsp;done

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:31.894
They're just playing into the hands of&nbsp;the church.

00:06:31.894 --> 00:06:35.836
No, but two of them are Prime Minister.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.017
Retired Prime Ministers, two&nbsp;of them.
 One of them is from the Lutheran Church.

00:06:42.326 --> 00:06:50.805
 He's not a Catholic. But no, I don't think any Bishop
 should become a juge. They are not.

00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:56.373
And two of them are Prime Ministers, retired.
&nbsp;

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:08.380
But the Swedish&nbsp;Prime Minister took a lot of money for&nbsp;
this BO force of this Rajiv Gandhi that&nbsp;we have.

00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:13.124
I don't know what sort of Prime Minister
 they have there, in Norway.

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:24.528
They are very highly placed people to do such&nbsp;
a stupid thing that all over the world they are criticized.

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:34.345
 Nobody even knew where&nbsp;their Timor was.
their was nobody they had to give a

00:07:34.345 --> 00:07:36.209
 Nobody and it matters.

00:07:36.209 --> 00:07:38.671
You see, they had to give a map.

00:07:41.591 --> 00:07:49.204
Shri Mataji, when we heard it in the&nbsp;news, that from 
East Timor, really, nobody knew where it was.

00:07:49.472 --> 00:07:54.734
 And that too&nbsp;East in such a small little spot,
 in the corner of something.

00:07:56.712 --> 00:08:04.591
But when CP went there, you see, the man&nbsp;
who saw all that and he said, "Oh, ‘baba’ this is definite 100%". 

00:08:04.591 --> 00:08:11.131
But of course the committee&nbsp;
will have to decide but if you ask me it's complete.

00:08:11.694 --> 00:08:12.883
 What is it?

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.494
It's the telephone.

00:08:20.594 --> 00:08:24.581
I have, Shri Mataji, I have read some very&nbsp;sharp criticism.

00:08:24.581 --> 00:08:30.189
Come here. I can't hear you. My ears have gone off in the plane.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:40.545
I have read some very sharp criticism&nbsp;
of this Nobel Peace Prize being given&nbsp;to this man.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:49.826
I read very sharp criticism of the&nbsp;
fact that the Peace Prize was given the way&nbsp;it was given. 

00:08:50.154 --> 00:08:57.920
The main idea was that the&nbsp;Nobel committee
  has become so political&nbsp;that they no more judge.

00:09:00.877 --> 00:09:06.288
Of course, it&nbsp;was just to fight the
 Indonesian people.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:14.926
First not only political, but also they very fundamentalist&nbsp;
because they wanted to give it to these two&nbsp;Catholics. 

00:09:15.521 --> 00:09:21.437
This is obviously why should you support&nbsp;them?
They should give it to these people in&nbsp;Ireland

00:09:22.106 --> 00:09:26.748
Why not give to them?

00:09:26.748 --> 00:09:33.096
If by Revolution&nbsp;if you are going to bring peace, 
I've never seen it happen.

00:09:33.096 --> 00:09:39.024
It's the evolution but they don't want to accept.

00:09:39.024 --> 00:09:47.073
Maybe, I&nbsp;think, you see, they might have heard 
from these French, they call us cult and all that.

00:09:47.073 --> 00:09:52.850
 But there is&nbsp;a proof of it, you see. They have
 made a beautiful&nbsp;brochure, no doubt of it.

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:58.192
CP is hoping against hope still. He felt very sad. 

00:09:58.192 --> 00:10:02.613
I was- it's all right, what does it matter?

00:10:02.804 --> 00:10:13.082
But imagine in this light, whatever it is, how these&nbsp;
people are exposed to such an extent horrible criticism?

00:10:13.504 --> 00:10:19.029
 How can you imagine so&nbsp;
many countries banning this man?

00:10:21.337 --> 00:10:30.220
I think this was the best way for the Noble&nbsp;
committee, whether it's for peace or for anything else,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:38.038
to make a bad reputation for themselves because&nbsp;
the critics are so sharp especially for this Peace&nbsp;Prize

00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:44.482
 that I think next time they probably&nbsp;
will think 10 times before they decide who&nbsp;to give it to.

00:10:44.945 --> 00:10:52.725
 I think next time, probably, the&nbsp;Committee will have to think 
very hard before&nbsp;they decide whom to give it to

00:10:52.725 --> 00:10:55.679
because they are&nbsp;being very badly criticized now.

00:10:55.855 --> 00:11:00.764
They are shameless, I think.

00:11:02.483 --> 00:11:06.329
You see, this man, we have got record about him.

00:11:06.646 --> 00:11:15.241
It came from&nbsp;Australia
 that he murdered people his own wife has said it.

00:11:16.719 --> 00:11:23.824
I mean, if they want to give to a murderer, how can they give me, I'm not a murderer. 

00:11:27.468 --> 00:11:31.701
If that is the qualification!

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.607
It's going to be very difficult for all of you.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.293
I am on the opposite line.

00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:51.442
But there is another thing that's happening&nbsp;is,
there is a peace conference in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:52.945 --> 00:12:03.216
All sponsored and helped and, I mean, originated by a&nbsp;
nephew of Nobel who lives in America. 

00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:10.993
And he wants to start a very big university called Peace&nbsp;University

00:12:11.274 --> 00:12:21.333
in Alandi which is the place 
where Shri Dnyaneshwara took his samadhi.

00:12:21.614 --> 00:12:27.779
He was only 23 years of age, Dnyaneshwara, 
and he took his samadhi.

00:12:28.025 --> 00:12:32.473
This fellow went to Alandi and then he felt something about it.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.794
And he just decided to have a Peace University.

00:12:37.086 --> 00:12:41.209
But the&nbsp;man who is arranging is a man, [unclear]
his name is.

00:12:41.209 --> 00:12:45.531
He is a man who has done a lot for this Alandi place and all.

00:12:45.674 --> 00:12:50.575
But he not that honest also. It doesn't matter.&nbsp;

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:58.057
He has written to me with all protocol, everything, to Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi and all that.

00:12:58.057 --> 00:13:05.280
3 letters he has written, "Please come and attend this&nbsp;
conference and bless us and enlighten us" and all that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:06.324 --> 00:13:09.507
And also he has invited CP.

00:13:09.507 --> 00:13:19.797
And he sent words&nbsp;with Yogis that, 
"If CP can take over, it will&nbsp;be a nice idea for this University".

00:13:20.008 --> 00:13:30.000
 I said, "CP will take them to task,
they should know&nbsp;he is an extremely honest man".

00:13:30.244 --> 00:13:36.179
 They don't know&nbsp;about him, I think.
 He wouldn't like a Hanky Panky.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:44.200
So, there will be a problem. But they have&nbsp;
invited him. And they have invited also few people,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.417
all those who can come.

00:13:46.417 --> 00:13:49.236
So, those who are&nbsp;coming now for the Tour,

00:13:49.236 --> 00:13:54.648
I thought if they could come a little earlier, 
they could attend this&nbsp;conference.

00:13:55.176 --> 00:14:02.980
Also ask Philip also to come,
because they want to know about Kundalini.

00:14:03.262 --> 00:14:07.750
 Dnyaneshwara, imagine of all&nbsp;the - after so many years,
 

00:14:07.961 --> 00:14:18.521
they have seen the&nbsp;samadhi of Dnyaneshwara. And he wants us to talk&nbsp;on Dnyaneshwara, his philosophy 

00:14:18.732 --> 00:14:24.910
And to start this university. 
Now Dnyaneshwara has talked about Kundalini&nbsp;very clearly,

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:26.713
on the sixth chapter.

00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:33.126
Not that&nbsp;full knowledge, but at least he said that,&nbsp;
"That's one which does the job".

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.213
Sixth chapter in his Dnyaneshwari. 

00:14:37.494 --> 00:14:44.033
So, now how just see how&nbsp;
spontaneously it works and this mister

00:14:45.232 --> 00:14:50.561
What's his name, is it Nobel? But something, I forgot the&nbsp;
first name. He and his wife, 

00:14:50.737 --> 00:14:59.173
both are very&nbsp;anxious to start this. And they want to give a lot&nbsp;
of money but also they want money to be collected.

00:15:02.154 --> 00:15:08.201
So, there was the man who is the director of this university.

00:15:10.418 --> 00:15:17.334
His name is Ravi, South India, lives in USA.

00:15:17.828 --> 00:15:26.434
It is that I&nbsp;can't understand why
 Sahaja Yoga doesn't spread in America.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:35.277
They are money oriented people.They are not Spirit&nbsp;
oriented.

00:15:35.734 --> 00:15:40.636
"Ah". Then he said, "If you charge money, they will come to if you.

00:15:41.128 --> 00:15:47.623
 If you ask for money, they&nbsp;will come".
 "So, what should I, how should I ask?"&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:47.799 --> 00:15:53.048
He said, "At least, when they are coming for&nbsp;
the program, you must charge them". 

00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:59.289
More heavily&nbsp;you charge, the better it will be.  All that, [unclear]
&nbsp;

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.624
I said, "I'm sorry to say, but such people are&nbsp;useless for me, absolutely. 

00:16:05.624 --> 00:16:10.377
Those who are going&nbsp;to come here
 because they paying money I don't&nbsp;want them".

00:16:11.159 --> 00:16:15.761
 But you know, I was playing with him, a little bit
maya. 

00:16:15.902 --> 00:16:20.646
I said, "All right, tell us how much we should charge".

00:16:20.646 --> 00:16:25.931
The poor fellow! In the meanwhile, I raised his Kundalini. 

00:16:25.931 --> 00:16:29.800
So, he went away&nbsp;home. He said, "I don't know
 what is  happening to me.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:34.320
My life is changing, this thing, that thing".

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.893
I&nbsp;said, "Now tell me how much money you gave me".

00:16:40.366 --> 00:16:48.672
It's a silly idea. I said, "I don't want such stupid Americans&nbsp;
who want to come because I'm charging them now money.

00:16:48.672 --> 00:16:55.502
Such stupid people are not wanted in Sahaja Yoga".

00:16:56.557 --> 00:17:02.853
You see, they say, there is no credibility if it is free, according to their ideas. 

00:17:02.853 --> 00:17:07.587
I said, "If they think they can pay for&nbsp;Divinity,

00:17:07.833 --> 00:17:11.716
they should understand that&nbsp;it is not possible".

00:17:11.716 --> 00:17:16.898
I think, basically they&nbsp;don't understand what is Divinity. 

00:17:16.898 --> 00:17:19.291
I think, basically.

00:17:22.293 --> 00:17:27.171
Now so many seekers are there.
Like mad, they are seekers. 

00:17:27.171 --> 00:17:31.006
But all of them have lost their head.

00:17:31.322 --> 00:17:34.567
They don't know why they&nbsp;are seeking.

00:17:34.567 --> 00:17:38.030
The other day I read one book called Peaceful Warrior

00:17:38.296 --> 00:17:43.437
of one young boy&nbsp;getting that seeking within.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.209
And then, he, somehow, meets a Zen guru.

00:17:48.393 --> 00:17:56.856
And that Zen guru really tortures him, makes him run 
for miles together, do this do&nbsp;that.

00:17:56.856 --> 00:18:01.239
Ultimately, he achieves, he says so.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:10.259
My granddaughter was reading that&nbsp;book.
She said, "I'm so angry with guru, I would blast him.

00:18:11.232 --> 00:18:17.902
What sort of a guru he was, the way he was torturing this boy?"

00:18:18.871 --> 00:18:21.843
I said, "Zen system is not that bad.

00:18:21.843 --> 00:18:27.274
But I don't&nbsp;know what they used to do. 
If this is the&nbsp;case, it's better not to do Zen".

00:18:27.678 --> 00:18:34.397
But I've seen those&nbsp;who follow Zen,
 it's difficult to give them Realization.

00:18:39.387 --> 00:18:46.600
They are seekers, you see. What I'm saying,&nbsp;
even if they go to Zen, it's a seeking.

00:18:46.952 --> 00:18:52.437
And all the seekers are to be blessed. And definitely they are seekers.

00:18:52.613 --> 00:19:00.379
There were people from Rajneesh. Now they have come out. Some other people like ? and all that.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:05.894
Already&nbsp;there are all, poor things, have been ruined.

00:19:06.105 --> 00:19:16.823
I told this Ravi, "They have no money to pay now. 
It has all being taken away by these gurus".

00:19:24.527 --> 00:19:31.451
He said, "If you charge more, the more&nbsp;
will come". There's this Dalai Lama,

00:19:31.767 --> 00:19:36.447
he is a big beggar you know all around the world,&nbsp;
he is a famous beggar going around.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:36.658 --> 00:19:43.000
And all the actresses and actors called him&nbsp;
for a conference and gave him lots of money.

00:19:48.237 --> 00:19:53.845
And this lady, Mother Teresa, very hot tempered. 

00:19:54.161 --> 00:20:03.178
And Rajesh copies her.They said, "You must call&nbsp;her,
we must meet her, this thing". All the Western people.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:03.353 --> 00:20:07.432
So, for this conference he called her. So, she said, &nbsp;
"You know,

00:20:07.432 --> 00:20:11.282
when you eat your food", all the time,&nbsp;she is shaking like this and

00:20:11.493 --> 00:20:20.000
"When you eat your food,&nbsp;think of the poor. 
And when you are going out to&nbsp;enjoy life,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.708
think of the poor". Means, you should be&nbsp;
miserable actually, minimum.

00:20:24.708 --> 00:20:31.784
And after some time they found all the people who were there,

00:20:31.784 --> 00:20:38.637
 they&nbsp;started crying. I said, "Crocodile tears, will they give us some money?"

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:58.120
So, we have to look forward to those days,&nbsp;
when we'll have a nice place on the bank of river Ganges.

00:21:02.217 --> 00:21:07.410
Already, in Delhi, they have started a big project, 
you know about that? 

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:08.855
We didn't know.

00:21:08.855 --> 00:21:15.443
Ah, in Delhi, they&nbsp;have started a very big project and they&nbsp;
have got flats 

00:21:15.443 --> 00:21:20.552
they are offering for I don't&nbsp;know how many lacks of a piece.
 It's not much because

00:21:20.552 --> 00:21:25.562
what&nbsp;they are offering in 6 lakhs you can't get 46 for [unclear]

00:21:25.562 --> 00:21:35.528
Out of which they said, "Mother, we will be getting
 money more and then we'll build a big, huge [unclear]

00:21:35.727 --> 00:21:40.000
place for meditation.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.997
"Go ahead". So, they&nbsp;are selling it out and-
but to foreigners also, they would like to sell.

00:21:46.997 --> 00:21:52.307
But I&nbsp;said, "They would prefer to be in the Himalayas.

00:21:52.307 --> 00:21:55.747
Because Delhi, Delhi is a very hot place, you know". 

00:21:55.747 --> 00:22:00.003
So, they said, "Mother, then what to do?" 
I said, "You are getting all the Indians".

00:22:04.546 --> 00:22:11.444
I said, "I can buy two flats for my daughter's contribution".

00:22:13.449 --> 00:22:18.715
But it was such a venture and they&nbsp;got it for a song 

00:22:19.278 --> 00:22:23.923
And they&nbsp;got the permission from the government. 

00:22:24.557 --> 00:22:30.423
[Unclear]

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.948
Sahaja Yoga works in beautiful ways, you know. 

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:44.496
Especially these East Tamul people, like this, 

00:22:44.496 --> 00:22:50.900
they have achieved such fame that's not easy for anybody.

00:23:02.674 --> 00:23:09.577
There have been revolutions and revolutions.&nbsp;
Say, in France, there was such a big revolution so what?

00:23:11.337 --> 00:23:20.000
They are worse than now the kings of those days, drinking.

00:23:20.171 --> 00:23:26.389
 I tell you why&nbsp;they are angry with us,
 French&nbsp;are mostly, because we say we should&nbsp;not drink.

00:23:26.987 --> 00:23:31.264
Because all their wine will be wasted.

00:23:32.178 --> 00:23:35.829
All that business will go off.

00:23:40.745 --> 00:23:50.482
It's a good way. So, if you can&nbsp;put some
 vibrated water, it won't ferment.

00:23:54.437 --> 00:24:05.796
Once, I went to Switzerland, you see, and&nbsp;
I looked at all these fields of this growth of grapes

00:24:05.796 --> 00:24:13.384
 That year they said, "It did not&nbsp;ferment at all".  
They didn't know what had happened.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:31.701
French are like that. In my book, I have written&nbsp;
about them. Little bit, not much but have you seen my book?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:24:32.032 --> 00:24:34.134
- I read the first edition.
- Hum?

00:24:34.134 --> 00:24:38.571
I read the first one Shri Mataji, not&nbsp;the revised one.
I don't have the revised one.

00:24:38.958 --> 00:24:41.691
The revision is still on and on and on.

00:24:41.691 --> 00:24:49.470
But now,&nbsp;I think, the revision will be coming very soon. 

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.854
They make so many mistakes, so many&nbsp;mistakes!
Spelling mistakes these stupid Indians, you&nbsp;know.

00:24:56.998 --> 00:25:02.400
They don't know how to keep it all&nbsp;right 
and they know English very well.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:07.680
They gave it for editing to somebody&nbsp;
who knows English very well, you see.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.694
I don't know what happened. Then lastly&nbsp;
I asked my daughter 

00:25:12.694 --> 00:25:17.028
She is a MA, first class, to see all that.

00:25:17.028 --> 00:25:23.826
She said, "I can't understand all these mistakes, how they have come". Then she corrected all that.

00:25:25.495 --> 00:25:31.516
Then she said, "Mother, certain things you have written which Indians won’t understand. I said, "What? "

00:25:31.657 --> 00:25:37.400
"Like Greek tragedy, they won’t understand what it means". 

00:25:38.998 --> 00:25:43.340
Because we don't have that pattern, there.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:50.554
All right. I said so many things of the&nbsp;
West, you can't describe. So horrible!

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:58.815
Like what happened in Belgium, how can you&nbsp;
describe in that book. Shocking, absolutely&nbsp;shocking!

00:25:59.311 --> 00:26:06.028
 I mean, the way they do&nbsp;things in the West,  is too much!

00:26:06.239 --> 00:26:10.000
Unbelievable!

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.822
It's impossible. You know what happens to them?

00:26:18.613 --> 00:26:27.522
Reading another book, American, that&nbsp;man
 was describing how to get rid of&nbsp;this fear that you have 

00:26:27.522 --> 00:26:32.410
that you may abuse your child. Really.

00:26:32.726 --> 00:26:40.290
It's very difficult. "I was suggesting&nbsp;myself that  
you should slowly touch him&nbsp;and see what happens".

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:46.215
 Poor man, he was feeling&nbsp;
so nervous and miserable for nothing at all!

00:26:49.209 --> 00:26:58.266
First, all in the - even Italians, whenever they played football
and&nbsp;anybody made a goal,

00:26:58.266 --> 00:27:03.560
 means, you see, they have achieved that heaven, they used to&nbsp;
just hug, go on hugging each other. Now they don't.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:10.271
They just touch like this, you see. But they are so excited 
that they run out of the field.

00:27:13.508 --> 00:27:19.401
It's so unnatural If they are happy they can't even hug!

00:27:19.401 --> 00:27:24.319
It's the English disease, Mother.

00:27:34.548 --> 00:27:38.514
They lost this time I think, Italians.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:48.285
I didn't know that they had lost.

00:27:48.285 --> 00:27:53.321
But I was watching the news and in that, they showed the Italians feeling very shy.

00:27:53.321 --> 00:27:56.922
- So, I said, "What's the matter?" 
- Big tragedy!

00:27:58.399 --> 00:28:01.250
Big tragedy!

00:28:05.373 --> 00:28:14.882
That's why I prefer, you see, Cricket. A&nbsp;
very quiet nice game. There is no problem in that.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:15.128 --> 00:28:21.570
We, in India, wan against the Australia, 

00:28:21.851 --> 00:28:30.000
but lost against South Africa. So, C P said,
 "It is the best team. South Africa is the best team.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.982
I mean,  you&nbsp;become really sporty with that. You understand the sport.

00:28:38.495 --> 00:28:47.360
Because if you cannot enjoy&nbsp;in the game
 another person, another group&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:54.188
and you just identified with your group, then it's not a sport. Isn't it?

00:28:54.574 --> 00:28:59.264
You should be able to&nbsp;enjoy another person also.

00:28:59.643 --> 00:29:04.403
But Italians don't know who is a good&nbsp;
player in other countries, they don't know. No.

00:29:10.313 --> 00:29:15.879
You know, this gun is at me all the time, is it?

00:29:23.303 --> 00:29:28.727
But it might get only light&nbsp;and light and nothing else. Then what will happen?

00:29:29.255 --> 00:29:31.492
You can’t have pity [unsure].

00:29:31.663 --> 00:29:33.385
OK. 

00:29:34.968 --> 00:29:38.457
You got some miraculous photographs, I'm told.

00:29:38.457 --> 00:29:40.708
 Yes, Shri Mataji. We have.

00:29:47.083 --> 00:29:52.802
They might say that we&nbsp;have done it through computer projection.

00:29:53.436 --> 00:29:55.790
Yes, what's the news?

00:29:55.790 --> 00:30:00.000
- They ask if everything&nbsp;is OK.
- Hum?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.527
 They are asking Mother's name and if everything is OK.

00:30:03.527 --> 00:30:05.998
Mother is good.

00:30:05.998 --> 00:30:08.574
- They ask if
- Loudly now.

00:30:08.574 --> 00:30:11.264
Yes, yes. They ask if you need anything.

00:30:11.264 --> 00:30:14.716
Now, what do I need now, you see? 

00:30:15.015 --> 00:30:17.275
Everything is OK.

00:30:17.275 --> 00:30:28.049
What is that? Absolutely first. You see, I&nbsp;
a person who can live anywhere,

00:30:28.592 --> 00:30:33.826
sleep anywhere, eat anything. I don't have all the sense  

00:30:36.851 --> 00:30:43.222
Of course, I appreciate beautiful&nbsp;things.
 But I don't want to have them, I appreciate.

00:30:47.635 --> 00:30:49.937
What is that?

00:30:49.937 --> 00:30:51.509
- Diner. 
- Eating? 

00:30:51.509 --> 00:30:53.598
- Yes. 
- All right.
