1
00:00:17,812 --> 00:00:23,207
I am so very filled with joy

2
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:32,943
 and My heart is so full of gratitude for

3
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:38,657
all the Sahaja Yogis who have been able

4
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,836
to create this beautiful place.

5
00:00:44,513 --> 00:00:52,190
 I cannot imagine how much they must have worked hard

6
00:00:52,574 --> 00:01:01,364
 in such a place to create such  a beautiful

7
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:09,350
 area, such a blissful place.

8
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:25,018
How in Sahaja Yoga people work together

9
00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:31,208
 with tremendous respect and love for each other,

10
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:37,397
and produce something that is unbelievable.

11
00:01:40,432 --> 00:01:42,955
This was just a wilderness,

12
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,308
and you have brought so much of

13
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:52,815
life and light in this place.

14
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:05,323
 You wanted to celebrate My birthday.

15
00:02:07,613 --> 00:02:12,751
 I don't know what is such a significant about it.

16
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:19,569
 But the way you have really

17
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:23,945
 shown your understanding and respect,

18
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:29,576
I am just enamored.  I can't  understand

19
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:32,497
 what have I done for you, that

20
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:35,894
you should do so much for Sahaja Yoga.

21
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:44,953
 As it is, today is also a very auspicious day

22
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:48,418
 which we call as the Holi.

23
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:55,201
They play Holion this day and show their love

24
00:02:56,058 --> 00:02:59,564
 and oneness among themselves.

25
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:03,776
This is the time when we have to

26
00:03:04,705 --> 00:03:09,022
really understand the value of love,

27
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:14,318
of respect of others,

28
00:03:15,215 --> 00:03:21,594
 because so far we have based all our theories and

29
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:27,958
 all our ideas on the principle that human beings

30
00:03:28,312 --> 00:03:35,568
cannot love each other: they are always trying to overpower others

31
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:40,256
 or to hate others, or to grab things from others.

32
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:44,877
Such a wrong idea we had all these days,

33
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,131
 and that's why all the organizations that were created

34
00:03:49,304 --> 00:03:52,901
to obstruct it also got contaminated with it.

35
00:03:57,813 --> 00:04:03,336
The only way one can really understand

36
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:08,154
what we are is by knowing yourself.

37
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:13,142
When you know yourself you are surprised that

38
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:18,751
what is the greatest thing for you is to love and to be loved.

39
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:23,399
 You enjoy that collective love so much

40
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:29,636
 when you are absolutely overcome

41
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:36,856
 your baser self. In Sahaja Yoga it is so simple.

42
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:39,544
It works in a very simple manner.

43
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:47,733
 It's very Sahaja, but to grow into it is very important,

44
00:04:48,484 --> 00:04:52,105
and I am so very happy to see so many of you

45
00:04:52,322 --> 00:04:57,736
 from all over the world, from Delhi and also from all over India,

46
00:04:58,728 --> 00:05:01,624
 enjoying that love among yourselves

47
00:05:01,776 --> 00:05:05,148
and understanding among yourselves.

48
00:05:07,502 --> 00:05:10,996
I never expected that in My lifetime

49
00:05:11,283 --> 00:05:14,018
I'll be able to see all this beautiful

50
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:18,669
world of love, trust and peace.

51
00:05:19,138 --> 00:05:23,336
 But today really I must say it shows

52
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:27,634
 what we are capable of doing.

53
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:36,314
 We human beings, so-called, are very selfish, self-centered

54
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:40,361
and only worried about ourselves:

55
00:05:40,846 --> 00:05:45,470
that is what is said; but it's surprising

56
00:05:45,644 --> 00:05:50,142
 that with Self-Realization, with self-knowledge,

57
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:55,621
 with knowing yourself, you understand how rich you are within,

58
00:05:56,002 --> 00:06:00,460
 how great you are within and how capable you are.

59
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:03,703
 This understanding comes to you,

60
00:06:03,949 --> 00:06:08,700
 and then that is expressed in such a beautiful manner.

61
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:15,310
Sahaja Yoga took time to grow, slowly and slowly,

62
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:22,539
 and that you all have slowly and slowly grown also.

63
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:29,046
 But today I must say that it has reached such a height

64
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:35,086
that it's difficult for people to get out of it.

65
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:40,670
 When you know yourself, when you know what is reality

66
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:43,310
and what is absolute truth,

67
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:47,779
you just get dissolved into that knowledge.

68
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:55,428
 Of course you are not knowledgeable in the way people are;

69
00:06:56,174 --> 00:07:00,164
you are knowledgeable in the real sense of the word,

70
00:07:00,555 --> 00:07:07,555
because you realize what is within you is a big power of love.

71
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:11,507
There's a big power of understanding.

72
00:07:14,554 --> 00:07:17,251
 There's a big power of understanding,

73
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:22,108
 a big power of oneness, of collective.

74
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:25,973
This collectivity works wonders

75
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:30,052
and gives such joy that we are all one,

76
00:07:30,397 --> 00:07:35,535
 we have no enemies, we have no problems.

77
00:07:35,876 --> 00:07:39,748
 We are all one together.

78
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:14,314
 This joy that was expressed by you

79
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:23,245
 is like the waves that go to the shores,

80
00:08:24,015 --> 00:08:28,720
touch the shores and come back, creating beautiful patterns.

81
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,571
And I see that happening now,

82
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:37,490
that these beautiful patterns are showing in your own life,

83
00:08:37,713 --> 00:08:40,873
 in your lifestyle, in your behavior.

84
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:47,136
There is a very special type of human race is sitting before Me.

85
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:57,216
 I am so much thankful to you, absolutely,

86
00:08:57,906 --> 00:09:06,482
that you should take to this simple knowledge of yourself

87
00:09:07,224 --> 00:09:10,056
and enjoy it with others.

88
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,150
 It's something remarkable that you know about yourself,

89
00:09:16,738 --> 00:09:19,626
that's only human beings can do.

90
00:09:19,897 --> 00:09:23,103
 There can be a diamond, very expensive,

91
00:09:23,357 --> 00:09:25,608
 but it doesn't know its value.

92
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:30,260
There could be some dog or some animal

93
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:33,622
which must be something par excellence,

94
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:36,543
but he doesn't know what he is.

95
00:09:36,832 --> 00:09:40,427
Same thing happens with the human beings

96
00:09:40,906 --> 00:09:43,355
till they get their Self-Realization,

97
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:50,622
 and after Realization they suddenly become aware of what they are.

98
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:57,493
 And then suddenly they become very humble, they become very loving.

99
00:09:58,013 --> 00:10:01,520
Now supposing if somebody knows that he is a king,

100
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:07,586
 or he discovers that he is a some great musician or a

101
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:13,798
 prime minister or something: he feels very aloof

102
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:17,452
and he thinks no end of himself.

103
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:21,380
 But by this knowledge that you have,

104
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:26,740
 you become one with the rest of Sahaja Yogis and enjoy it.

105
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:30,681
 It's very remarkable how it works out

106
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,343
 that you enjoy each other so much,

107
00:10:34,671 --> 00:10:39,357
and to do something for this collective work,

108
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:43,495
you can dedicate yourself to it.

109
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:50,312
Now My experience of seventy-seven years, as you can say,

110
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:54,842
 has been really checkered with all kinds of incidents,

111
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:59,550
all kinds of people, all kinds of incidents.

112
00:11:00,215 --> 00:11:05,068
And it's a good vision to see

113
00:11:05,544 --> 00:11:08,962
 before your eyes that despite all that,

114
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:12,494
so many beautiful lotuses have come out,

115
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:18,487
 and they are so fragrant, so beautiful,

116
00:11:18,647 --> 00:11:21,702
 so colorful, so attractive.

117
00:11:22,784 --> 00:11:30,292
 All this is because we have a innate  value system,

118
00:11:32,217 --> 00:11:35,898
 because we have inborn within us a great

119
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:43,610
 sense of love and compassion.

120
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:49,283
 This compassion has to be really

121
00:11:50,513 --> 00:11:56,717
understood and enjoyed, and jump in the ocean of compassion.

122
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,977
So beautiful, and you'll be amazed to see

123
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:04,151
 that automatically you'll swim,

124
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:09,445
automatically you'll meet other people also in the same ocean,

125
00:12:09,798 --> 00:12:13,610
 and without any problems, without any troubles,

126
00:12:13,785 --> 00:12:20,669
 all enjoying the bliss of this love,
 this compassion, this Divine love.

127
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:27,730
 I must really congratulate

128
00:12:27,976 --> 00:12:33,182
 the Delhi people for coming up so well

129
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:40,048
with this beautiful arrangement  and this beautiful pendal,

130
00:12:40,621 --> 00:12:45,993
and all the beautiful arrangements
they have made outside for your stay.

131
00:12:46,192 --> 00:12:48,890
 I mean really it's something,

132
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:54,194
 I have done nothing for it, nothing, I should say.

133
00:12:54,757 --> 00:12:58,035
How these people have worked together:

134
00:12:58,186 --> 00:13:01,424
 there have been no quarrels, fighting,

135
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:05,513
 backbiting, nothing of the kind. It's very surprising

136
00:13:05,894 --> 00:13:09,601
 that such a beautiful thing has been created by them:

137
00:13:09,927 --> 00:13:13,766
 shows their maturity in Sahaja Yoga.

138
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,590
 I must congratulate them again and again

139
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:20,391
for doing this great work

140
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:23,430
in such a short time.

 
1
00:13:24,385 --> 00:13:26,976
First I talked in English because

2
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:29,700
here many people have come from foreign countries

3
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,161
and you don't have any objection

4
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,955
that I talk in English for a little while.

5
00:13:35,124 --> 00:13:39,696
Although it is a great thing of Dehlites

6
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:45,251
and along with them the people of Uttarpradesh also joined.

7
00:13:45,787 --> 00:13:52,933
People of Rajasthan also joined and the people from Haryana also helped.

8
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,051
All of them have collectively made with love this

9
00:13:57,076 --> 00:14:00,539
very beautiful pandal like a temple.

10
00:14:00,937 --> 00:14:06,338
On seeing it I was Myself surprised

11
00:14:07,032 --> 00:14:10,623
that here are such talented artists.

12
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:12,581
I didn't know.

13
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:15,246
Wherefrom this art came?

14
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:21,045
How did they make it and decorate all this, I can't understand.

15
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:27,529
I didn't know that there are artists of such caliber in our country

16
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:30,247
and that too caliber of love.

17
00:14:30,272 --> 00:14:34,686
The power of 'love' and the art of 'love'

18
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:38,446
the art of loving everybody

19
00:14:38,471 --> 00:14:43,418
whosoever will get it, he only can do such an artistic composition.

20
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:46,430
One should learn this art

21
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:54,285
how can we with the help of our speech, mind and wisdom

22
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:59,096
become artists, artists of 'love'

23
00:14:59,121 --> 00:15:03,824
and how can we give comfort to others

24
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:06,687
and joy to others.

25
00:15:06,712 --> 00:15:11,477
Which lovable talk is such that we can do.

26
00:15:11,502 --> 00:15:13,777
One it is with the help of speech

27
00:15:14,017 --> 00:15:18,390
then with wisdom how can we think?

28
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:22,997
How can we shower our love among people?

29
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:30,137
How can we open our heart in front of others

30
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,803
and establish them in our heart?

31
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:41,129
And we should think that the heart which doesn't have love

32
00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:45,307
he is not an authority of anything in the world.

33
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:52,010
Because whatever he gets, he cannot be contented in any way with that

34
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,435
he cannot get contentment.

35
00:15:54,554 --> 00:16:00,716
But when there is an ocean of contentment within you

36
00:16:00,928 --> 00:16:05,685
what is it that cannot content you?

37
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:12,900
When it happens within you and you get the solution

38
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:21,064
then, nobody can understand the boundries of that solution

39
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:24,108
that nobody can understand this business.

40
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:29,866
Such melodious and such beautiful all that happens

41
00:16:29,891 --> 00:16:32,067
you cannot overlook it.

42
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:37,796
Can't understand what i am doing and what others are doing

43
00:16:37,821 --> 00:16:40,646
what they are saying and what i am saying.

44
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:46,365
And how are they covering me with their love

45
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:54,135
and how shall we shower them with our love.

46
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,746
Day and night the same worry goes on

47
00:16:56,913 --> 00:16:59,379
that today whom I have to meet

48
00:16:59,404 --> 00:17:03,325
and what loving things should I tell them.

49
00:17:03,744 --> 00:17:07,208
What useful things should be talked about.

50
00:17:07,233 --> 00:17:12,275
Because the practice of talking about useless things

51
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:13,871
leads only to loss.

52
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:15,771
It has never been useful

53
00:17:16,081 --> 00:17:21,061
and more than that the anger that is there in a human being

54
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:24,223
leads to all the more complications.

55
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:29,865
There was no need to teach you not to do violence

56
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,067
don't treat anyone badly

57
00:17:34,092 --> 00:17:36,620
don't destroy anyone

58
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:38,489
don't grab somebody's money.

59
00:17:38,514 --> 00:17:40,398
There is no need to teach all this.

60
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:44,127
You became so dignified on your own.

61
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:48,431
I said now you too have become lotuses

62
00:17:48,456 --> 00:17:51,781
that you know to give only your fragrance

63
00:17:52,211 --> 00:17:53,822
and don't know anything else.

64
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:57,528
And the joy of giving to others

65
00:17:57,553 --> 00:18:04,005
and to feel its joy is a strange experience.

66
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:08,144
Only people of unique character can do it.

67
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:12,344
Now you are the masters of it

68
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:18,082
and the heritage that we had kept with you

69
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:21,324
you have utilized fully.

70
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:23,744
Now that thing is open to everyone

71
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,935
it didn't harm anyone.

72
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,479
Now it is a matter of enjoyment.

73
00:18:28,382 --> 00:18:32,859
Many people in the world are of different types

74
00:18:32,884 --> 00:18:35,560
but they cannot touch you

75
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,376
cannot bother you.

76
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:43,702
Even if there can be something, that too may be absorbed by you.

77
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:45,302
let them join you.

78
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:47,871
Watching your lifestyle

79
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:54,086
let them have atleast the inclination to change their life.

80
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,030
Let us also change.

81
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:57,475
I don't say that

82
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,760
I have signed the contract of changing this whole world

83
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:05,556
but you can sign this contract.

84
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:08,232
If you will change this world

85
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:14,182
If you invite moral, kind and gentle people

86
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:20,384
there is no need to do anything more.

87
00:19:20,553 --> 00:19:24,009
then you go on looking at it.

88
00:19:24,034 --> 00:19:29,584
The only important thing is that you get attatched to it

89
00:19:29,944 --> 00:19:35,013
Get engaged into it and find out how many people can we transform?

90
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,827
I agree that an ordinary man has got a number of flaws.

91
00:19:39,852 --> 00:19:44,819
A man full of flaws you can

92
00:19:44,844 --> 00:19:52,830
very beautifully give knowledge of a good and unknown self

93
00:19:52,855 --> 00:19:54,909
the self within us.

94
00:19:54,934 --> 00:20:01,093
When you come into contact with the spirit inside us

95
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,374
you come to know that others too must do so.

96
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:07,748
know yourself all the more.

97
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,269
They are lost.

98
00:20:09,294 --> 00:20:14,243
They don't know how much prime wealth they have inside them.

99
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:16,710
So, they must be given it

100
00:20:16,735 --> 00:20:19,607
and they must get it.

101
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:23,116
When such conversations will start taking place

102
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:26,154
you will take its responsibility on your ownself

103
00:20:26,503 --> 00:20:30,999
that we too should give others this prime wealth.

104
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:33,758
Their keys are with you

105
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:41,097
and if you somehow give this great contribution

106
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:45,433
just watch how they will recognize you

107
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:49,546
and how they will be greatful to you.

108
00:20:50,038 --> 00:20:52,788
The greatest work for you now is that

109
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:57,354
you bring as many people as you can to Sahaja state

110
00:20:58,047 --> 00:20:59,662
and give them this wealth

111
00:20:59,687 --> 00:21:04,279
and when this will happen

112
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,965
you will yourself get busy and be happy

113
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:14,337
and a type of joy which cannot be described

114
00:21:14,521 --> 00:21:15,521
you will get.

115
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:17,834
This has to be done.

116
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:21,339
Today you have celebrated My Birthday.

117
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:26,771
I should say a lot of thanks for that

118
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:29,795
and you have done all this joyfully

119
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:36,940
but for Me it is so that every year Sahajyoga has been spreading

120
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:42,105
and even I too cannot understand its boundries.

121
00:21:42,328 --> 00:21:46,292
But today you too must take a decision

122
00:21:46,317 --> 00:21:54,714
that on the birthday of Mother we will try to transform others.

123
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:58,543
Our transformation has already been done but must do of others as well.

124
00:21:59,091 --> 00:22:04,783
This only  will give you complete contentment of this joy.

125
00:22:04,808 --> 00:22:07,408
Till now the joy you have is limited

126
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:09,882
when you will distribute it among others

127
00:22:09,907 --> 00:22:12,611
and when it will be echoed in others

128
00:22:12,747 --> 00:22:19,893
when you will come to know about it, understand it

129
00:22:20,854 --> 00:22:28,469
a great new joy will awaken within yourself.

130
00:22:28,494 --> 00:22:37,737
I was watching your young boys, children dancing joyfully.

131
00:22:38,488 --> 00:22:43,912
Krishna got celebrated Holi so that everybody get joy.

132
00:22:43,937 --> 00:22:49,828
Shri Ram's style made a human being very serious type.

133
00:22:49,852 --> 00:22:52,293
His life became serious.

134
00:22:52,318 --> 00:22:55,468
He (Shri Krishna) devised a method so that a human being

135
00:22:55,493 --> 00:22:58,477
 cound open up himself and play mirthfully.

136
00:22:58,802 --> 00:23:02,865
Now that thing only Sahajyogis can do practically

137
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:07,702
can play Holi with love amongst themselves.

138
00:23:07,727 --> 00:23:11,146
Not to trouble others

139
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:17,561
but to express their own joy and to make feel others joyous as well.

140
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:20,759
Eternal blessings to everyone.
