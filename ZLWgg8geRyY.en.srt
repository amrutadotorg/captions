1
00:00:08,711 --> 00:00:11,845
So now there has to be a method

2
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:17,847
that automatically gives you a balance 
as well as a good ascent

3
00:00:17,927 --> 00:00:24,143
and a happy landings into the Kingdom of God.

4
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:28,108
That has to happen.

5
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:33,685
Now, you are all built-in that way, this is
what it is,

6
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:38,012
but again you don’t have that faith in Me, 
neither in what we are saying.

7
00:00:38,093 --> 00:00:42,357
Because again: “I believe in Mataji,”
there are many who finish with that.

8
00:00:43,576 --> 00:00:50,215
You have to have faith in your Self, 
in your Spirit, by experiencing it.

9
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:57,688
It’s a something, a dynamic thing that has
to happen within you – a tremendous thing.

10
00:00:57,769 --> 00:01:01,482
It’s nothing something, just your mental
belief that,

11
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:06,194
“Today we are communist, tomorrow we 
are capitalist,” and third day something else.

12
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:14,066
It’s something that has to become, 
again I say "become," and again "become".

13
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:21,695
And that becoming is now.

14
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:24,078
The time has come.

15
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:32,557
This is the resurrection time; this is the
Last Judgment, believe it or not.

16
00:01:32,638 --> 00:01:37,326
There is not going to be 
another time for that.

17
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:47,786
This is the way we are going to be judged:
our maturity, our balance, our capacity.

18
00:01:47,952 --> 00:01:58,629
Many people come to our meetings, few get
their realization, or many get their realization

19
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:04,995
– makes no difference to Me, to anyone or
to Sahaja Yog or to you.

20
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:10,379
Because if there are seeds which are 
just sprouted and are wasted;

21
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:14,471
they are wasted as if they are not sprouted.

22
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,411
They do not grow.

23
00:02:19,877 --> 00:02:33,268
They are just like any other seeds 
which have not been touched by the Divine.

24
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:40,348
Even if you get realization, which is
now quite easy for people to get to,

25
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:44,619
they are for it, because the Divine is anxious,

26
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:50,584
because your Creator is anxious,
 to manifest itself,

27
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:59,581
but to settle down as a realized soul 
is difficult.

28
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:04,374
I have to tell you at the very outset

29
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:12,500
that if you have to mature into it 
you have to understand yourself.

30
00:03:12,637 --> 00:03:15,375
You must have your self-esteem.

31
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:18,684
If you just are here for a shopping,

32
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:24,216
“Oh, all right, let’s hear Mother also,” 
that’s not the way it is going to work out.

33
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:30,932
If you are people of that caliber, 
   then only you can ascend.

34
00:03:31,513 --> 00:03:33,389
There’s nothing else needed of you.

35
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:40,112
You may be a prime minister or you may be
a queen or you may be just a parlor maid,

36
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:43,629
makes no difference to the Divine.

37
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:48,085
You may be a socialist, communist or a capitalist,
makes no difference.

38
00:03:48,177 --> 00:03:52,719
You may be this color, that color, makes no
difference.

39
00:03:53,152 --> 00:03:59,016
But you have to have the caliber of a true
seeker,

40
00:03:59,096 --> 00:04:02,510
who is intelligent enough to see

41
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:10,219
that he has not come on this earth 
just to be wasted.

42
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:15,920
If you make many instruments 
and if they are just wasted,

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,616
they are not put to the mains,
 they are good for nothing,

44
00:04:19,696 --> 00:04:21,886
they have very loose connections,

45
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:28,768
He’ll just say, “Cancel all these. Stop this factory.

46
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:32,857
There’s no use having any more creations.”

47
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:40,841
Only those who are matured enough, 
who have self-esteem

48
00:04:40,921 --> 00:04:43,673
– even age, you’ll be surprised, does not matter –

49
00:04:43,753 --> 00:04:48,633
I have seen people who are eighty 
years of age could be very stupid,

50
00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:56,037
and people who are very young, very small
children also, could be great.

51
00:04:56,117 --> 00:05:05,619
So it is the inner quality of a person, his
maturity, that matters in Sahaj Yoga.

52
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:11,736
I know it is rather difficult to understand

53
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:17,980
that why, if it is Sahaja, if the Kundalini
 rises so easily in us,

54
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,339
why is it we take time to establish ourselves?

55
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:28,261
The reason is very simple.

56
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:34,376
We are not simple people, we are not, 
we are very complicated,

57
00:05:34,456 --> 00:05:39,749
we have complicated our lives 
with so many problems.
