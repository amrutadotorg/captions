00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:15.796
So now when we have pure love for someone,
we see the whole thing in a different manner,

00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:23.521
we see a person in a different
manner and it becomes very sweet.

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:34.423
Otherwise truth can be very bitter, can be very painful,

00:00:34.503 --> 00:00:43.236
but truth which is adorned with love
is just like a flower without the thorns.

00:00:43.316 --> 00:00:55.481
It’s very interesting how a person who is
pouring with love and is standing on truth

00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:58.594
- that’s the personality you have to become.

00:00:59.946 --> 00:01:08.131
Now in the expression of love we
can take an example to understand.

00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:18.471
Supposing I meet somebody and he is telling
all kinds of horrible things about another person.

00:01:18.898 --> 00:01:26.567
So I feel tremendous love for him as well as
for the person whom he is telling all these things.

00:01:26.647 --> 00:01:37.631
So now I take to lie, a complete
lie, which is a truth, also in a way.

00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:41.811
I tell that person, see what are you talking.

00:01:42.346 --> 00:01:45.510
The person about whom you are saying all this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.239
had been just praising you all the
time, and here you are talking like this.

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:59.321
Now this is not the truth actually,
but you take the help of the lie,

00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:06.812
the other side of the truth, to bring out
a friendship between the two persons.

00:02:06.892 --> 00:02:16.224
So this is what is the work of love, that it
tries to bring people closer to each other:

00:02:16.304 --> 00:02:26.374
to say things by which they become one, united.

00:02:26.454 --> 00:02:34.116
So all the divisive methods that we have used
so far just disappear and we try to understand

00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:45.143
what is the method by which we can join people’s heart.

00:02:45.223 --> 00:02:51.322
As it is you are in collective consciousness,
but this collective consciousness,

00:02:51.402 --> 00:02:58.556
if it is supericial you can achieve
great results like as you have done it

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:07.543
- maybe you can build beautiful
ashrams, you can do all this.

00:03:08.494 --> 00:03:15.469
But when it is filled with love, collective consciousness,

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:22.414
then the joy is complete of collective consciousness.

00:03:22.494 --> 00:03:25.744
Now people talk of peace.

00:03:25.824 --> 00:03:31.717
You cannot have peace without this new
awareness we call it collective consciousness,

00:03:31.797 --> 00:03:45.608
but in that also there has to be
the main tattwa, principle of love.

00:03:45.688 --> 00:03:55.320
For example now, Sahaja Yogis say from Germany
and Austria are going to Israel - it is very fulfilling.

00:03:56.114 --> 00:04:05.108
I was happy that they have chosen
for this Puja people from Israel,

00:04:05.188 --> 00:04:15.014
and then I found Israelies coming to Egypt
forgetting all that Muslims had done to them.

00:04:15.094 --> 00:04:24.135
It’s really remarkable how people get
attracted towards expression of their love,

00:04:24.215 --> 00:04:28.189
to their fellow men, to other Sahaja Yogis,

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:36.654
and once it starts growing you will be
surprised how we can change this world.

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:47.742
Most of the problems, human problems,
are due to hatred and is very commonly used:

00:04:47.822 --> 00:04:54.921
I hate, I hate, it’s absurdity, it’s a sin to hate someone.

00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:57.404
Why do you hate someone.

00:04:57.484 --> 00:05:05.584
You can hate the sin, you can hate the evil, but
you should not hate people just for hating sake.

00:05:05.664 --> 00:05:12.759
This hatred that we have is responsible
for all the problems we have had so far.

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:21.704
Because one person becomes very powerful,
by dividing people he becomes very powerful,

00:05:21.784 --> 00:05:27.382
and these divisive things have
really crushed so many countries.

00:05:27.462 --> 00:05:33.392
You have no business to condemn anyone, you
have come from such a condemned condition yourself,

00:05:33.472 --> 00:05:36.077
so why are you condemning others.

00:05:36.157 --> 00:05:43.287
Only thing is if you are capable, if you are
equipped, if you are matured enough in Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:43.367 --> 00:05:51.432
then you will just take it up as a great
challenge of love and you will do it.

00:05:51.512 --> 00:05:55.499
But you won’t go on condemning that
person, finding faults with that person,

00:05:55.579 --> 00:06:00.010
it’s a very good excuse if you don’t want to do it.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:07.252
Supposing somebody is sick and the doctor
doesn’t know how to cure, so what does he do?

00:06:07.332 --> 00:06:13.243
He says you see you are sick because
this happened, because you went in the cold.

00:06:13.323 --> 00:06:18.943
Because this. Haribaba yes, but now I
am sick so now what about curing me.

00:06:19.023 --> 00:06:24.130
No, because you did this, because you
did that, you should not have done this.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.865
All about the past mistakes, he’ll go on.

00:06:26.945 --> 00:06:33.074
In the same way we go on: that
you did like this, you were like this,

00:06:33.154 --> 00:06:39.126
you went to the falara guru, you did this
kind of a mistake, that’s why you are like this.

00:06:39.206 --> 00:06:45.071
No, don’t tell him anything, just work it out and it works.

00:06:45.151 --> 00:06:51.145
Of course, you can ask if he has been to
some guru, but don’t condemn, don’t criticise,

00:06:51.225 --> 00:06:56.352
there is no need to condemn anybody
for what mistakes they have committed.

00:06:56.432 --> 00:07:03.062
This is all coming from the consciousness that you
are better equipped, that you have all the knowledge.

00:07:03.142 --> 00:07:09.552
You have, you are very knowledge
people, I must say very knowledgable.

00:07:09.632 --> 00:07:19.045
You are the gnostics, all that I accept, but
as long as you are aware of it you are not.

00:07:19.125 --> 00:07:27.772
Once you are not aware of it then
you are that what is called Sahaja Yogi.

00:07:27.852 --> 00:07:34.341
So I would expect all of you to have
this new development in their Sahasrara,

00:07:34.421 --> 00:07:37.752
in your Sahasrara, in everybody’s Sahasrara.

00:07:37.832 --> 00:07:44.391
We have to think of the whole world. We cannot
just think of Sahaja Yogis and also about the seekers.

00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:48.005
Seekers are there, alright, but what about the rest.

00:07:48.085 --> 00:07:52.326
There are so many problems there
and so many things are to be done.

00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:57.802
For example, now we have a problem in India of poverty.

00:07:57.882 --> 00:08:00.592
So I am trying to do something for them.

00:08:00.672 --> 00:08:04.029
You have problems in your countries.

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.489
You should find out what problems there are.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:13.396
You can start some sort of a movement
for them, try to help them as far as possible.

00:08:13.476 --> 00:08:19.647
It’s not missionary like, that you convert
somebody for some sort of a reward

00:08:19.727 --> 00:08:22.099
or for some name you have to do.

00:08:22.179 --> 00:08:26.806
You just do it for your pleasure,
because it’s your pleasure to do it.

00:08:26.886 --> 00:08:32.161
That’s how you'll go to the society and
you won’t be afraid that you'll be caught up.

00:08:32.241 --> 00:08:37.837
I know of one couple, when I asked
them, why don’t you start working it out.

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:41.371
So they said ‘Mother we are afraid our ego will come back’.

00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:45.944
They are afraid of themselves
only - their ego will come back.

00:08:46.024 --> 00:08:51.873
So all these problems should be
dropped out and you should reach that state

00:08:51.953 --> 00:08:58.784
where you don’t have all these fears, all
these non-sensical ideas about yourself.

00:08:58.864 --> 00:09:02.904
You are powerful. You have powers.

00:09:02.984 --> 00:09:07.520
Not only that, but you have been
specially bestowed with those powers.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.069
But if you don’t want use it then what are you?

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:18.014
If the lamp is not enlightened what
is this lamp for - just for decoration?

00:09:18.094 --> 00:09:25.896
So this has to be used, and this has to be
used without feeling that awareness within you

00:09:25.976 --> 00:09:30.652
that you are something great,
better than others, something selected,

00:09:30.732 --> 00:09:34.278
or also they say that we are chosen.

00:09:34.358 --> 00:09:42.416
All these things have to go away in a big
way when you become as I said, the ocean.

00:09:42.496 --> 00:09:49.754
Then you are not bothered what shore you
go, where you travel, you are not bothered,

00:09:49.834 --> 00:09:53.716
you are only with the ocean moving up and down.

00:09:53.796 --> 00:09:58.436
That is how it’s a living ocean of love,

00:09:58.516 --> 00:10:08.354
and that’s what we have to develop it-
without dominating others, without showing off.

00:10:11.805 --> 00:10:19.701
It should be, the whole thing
should be contented within ourself.

00:10:20.916 --> 00:10:25.790
In Hindi it is said better: Apneme ...(hindi...ndt).

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:34.740
Should be all within yourself
and that’s the most enjoyable thing.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:44.919
Because see what we want, supposing I want
something for myself, you see, so I’ll strive and get it.

00:10:44.999 --> 00:10:54.670
But this is something if you have within
yourself, you fully filled within yourself.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:11:01.621
So what is most important, what is so much needed? Nothing!

00:11:01.701 --> 00:11:14.880
You are completely filled with yourself,
contented with yourself, and then you want to share.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:20.212
This is the ideal way of dealing with Sahasrara, I think,

00:11:20.292 --> 00:11:31.203
and I am sure the day will come this whole
world’s Sahasrara has to be opened out.

00:11:31.283 --> 00:11:38.850
This is what we have to do it, and we are not
going to disappear into some exclusive places

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:45.780
that is just for meditation - you can
go there, but not for escaping the world.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.340
That is not the idea.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:55.430
Idea is for meditation, for your growth
- it would be a nice place to go to.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:12.130
It is very important to understand how valuable
you are, how remarkably important you are.

00:12:13.978 --> 00:12:21.100
Born at this time, got your realisation for what?

00:12:22.106 --> 00:12:27.874
To emancipate this world, to transform human beings,

00:12:27.954 --> 00:12:34.179
to take whole of this world into the realm of God.

00:12:34.259 --> 00:12:37.234
That is what you are here for.

00:12:37.314 --> 00:12:39.140
May God bless you.
