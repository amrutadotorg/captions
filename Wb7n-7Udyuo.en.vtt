00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:21.742
So now, when we understand

00:00:21.943 --> 00:00:26.292
that Shiva is the first thing that is
established in the matter,

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:31.340
then in us also first the Shiva is
established.

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:37.059
When the foetus takes its form,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.278
the throb in the heart is the establishment
of Shiva.

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:47.582
That is the sign that Shiva has been
established.

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:57.241
In case of people

00:00:58.788 --> 00:01:04.281
who are born with bad heart or with
troubles,

00:01:05.018 --> 00:01:08.699
one has to say that Shiva is not fully
established.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.468
Not that they are bad people, but they are
not supposed to live for long,

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:17.329
and have to have another heart later on
maybe,

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.220
or that there might be some sort of
a problem in their previous lives,

00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:28.915
and if they pay attention to Shiva tattwa,
their heart can be cured.

00:01:30.862 --> 00:01:34.957
So the most important organ in the body
is the heart.

00:01:35.167 --> 00:01:39.120
If the heart fails, you cannot remain
on this earth.

00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:42.212
So the most important thing is to look
after

00:01:42.413 --> 00:01:48.725
your Shiva principle which is the Atma.

00:01:48.926 --> 00:01:53.774
We are worried about every sort of mundane
thing.

00:01:54.297 --> 00:01:58.248
Worried about this, worried about that,

00:01:58.449 --> 00:02:05.030
but we are not worried about our Spirit.

00:02:06.115 --> 00:02:08.731
This is the biggest problem with us.

00:02:08.948 --> 00:02:14.175
If you worry about your Spirit, if you pay
attention to your Spirit,

00:02:14.376 --> 00:02:21.277
the whole universe then vibrates with
Parabrahma, which is nothing but joy.

00:02:21.478 --> 00:02:30.179
So without, without any attention
to Spirit,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.306
if we think we can enjoy life, you cannot.

00:02:33.507 --> 00:02:37.488
You cannot enjoy your life if you pay
attention

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:45.167
to other nonsensical things and you do not
pay attention to your Spirit.

00:02:45.368 --> 00:02:51.318
The complete silence comes into us only
through Spirit.

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.898
If the Spirit is awakened within us, this
silence starts working

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:03.956
and you feel extremely relaxed and
absolutely one with your Self.

00:03:04.157 --> 00:03:10.786
There is no problem, you don’t seek other
things that normally people seek -

00:03:10.987 --> 00:03:17.503
you seek your own company and you want
to be some time with yourself.

00:03:17.704 --> 00:03:22.182
Only thing that you seek after finding
your Spirit

00:03:22.383 --> 00:03:28.387
is the company of other Sahaja Yogis who
also have found the Spirit,

00:03:28.588 --> 00:03:34.115
so there is a rapport established between
Spirits, that is in the heart.

00:03:34.316 --> 00:03:39.371
And this Spirit is the universal being
within us, about which I have told you

00:03:39.572 --> 00:03:41.990
that once you become one with the Spirit,

00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:45.970
you automatically become universally
conscious.

00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:50.495
There are so many qualities of the Shiva,
Shiva tattwa,

00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:55.978
of the principle of Shiva, that I need not
tell you, but today I will tell you

00:03:56.179 --> 00:04:01.110
another dimension, which I have not touched
so far, about Shiva tattwa.

00:04:03.173 --> 00:04:06.635
The physical aspect of Shiva tattwa is

00:04:06.836 --> 00:04:14.163
that such a person is a more a cold type
of a person.

00:04:14.364 --> 00:04:24.939
In the sense, that such a person is not
a person who gives hot vibrations,

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:32.853
but who has too much of it (cold)
sometimes, not in balance, overdoes it,

00:04:33.054 --> 00:04:40.638
develops a kind of a temperament which
can be extremely cold.

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:45.788
Could be low blood pressure with it,
could be diarrhea also,

00:04:45.988 --> 00:04:51.429
diarrhea also one can get with too much
of spiritual strength.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:57.729
And also could be on the love side because
of the left side.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:05.439
Because left side is the kapha as you call
it, is kapha is the phlegm that is more.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.787
Because the left side is more, such
a person is always apt to catch colds

00:05:10.988 --> 00:05:16.948
and has problems of the colds.

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:19.751
So such a person has to protect oneself

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:23.064
from getting into colds and things
like that,

00:05:23.265 --> 00:05:27.957
and the methods to be employed are to be
learnt through Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:28.158 --> 00:05:37.388
But to give it a balance, the Spirit itself
is beyond health problems.

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:43.901
But the left-sided person who always thinks
of the Spirit, also can become one-sided.

00:05:44.102 --> 00:05:48.031
When he has to live on this earth, he has
to be a balanced person.

00:05:48.232 --> 00:05:52.991
So he has to take to another side and
that side is the activity

00:05:53.192 --> 00:05:59.915
of the spiritual growth within himself.
A person who is very spiritually developed

00:06:00.116 --> 00:06:04.210
cannot exist as a Shiva tattwa on this
earth.

00:06:04.411 --> 00:06:08.101
He has to exist as a balanced personality.

00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:12.271
And when he starts developing that
balancing within himself,

00:06:12.472 --> 00:06:19.043
the Spirit from his heart starts rising
and goes on top of his head.

00:06:19.244 --> 00:06:23.138
So this is the second stage where
one has to go.

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:25.568
Here is the whole collectivity.

00:06:25.769 --> 00:06:34.290
So when you start taking your love
and affection

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:42.614
into your central nervous system, you can
say, and put it on top of your head,

00:06:42.815 --> 00:06:45.804
that means, as soon as you put it
in your Virat,

00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:49.950
when it starts spreading through your
Virata shakti,

00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:55.762
through your collective being, then only
you are a complete personality.

00:06:55.963 --> 00:06:59.539
Otherwise, you are Shiva tattwa –
Shiva tattwa exists

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.900
whether this universe exists or not.

00:07:05.186 --> 00:07:09.239
It exists even when the whole universe
is existing;

00:07:09.513 --> 00:07:16.879
even, even it vanishes, it all goes into
that magnet, into that Shiva tattwa.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.262
So a person who has a spiritual hankering
must know

00:07:22.463 --> 00:07:28.700
that to raise your Shiva above the heart
level,

00:07:28.901 --> 00:07:37.210
he has to raise it gradually onto a very
detached method

00:07:37.411 --> 00:07:42.421
of existing on top of the Sahasrara,

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:47.005
where there is a complete balance,
complete balance.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:54.664
We all can change and inform each other
and improve and educate ourselves.

00:07:54.865 --> 00:07:58.736
All this education can come to us, if we
really love ourselves,

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:01.044
and care for our evolution.

00:08:01.245 --> 00:08:05.359
We don’t have to bother about it much,
if we really care for it.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:11.848
Gradually, all these things will work out
and the balance can be established.

00:08:12.049 --> 00:08:17.181
Those people who talk too much, should not
talk so much.

00:08:17.382 --> 00:08:21.240
What I feel that when you talk too much,
when you stop, you just stop.

00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:25.034
It is in between: when it is necessary
you must talk,

00:08:25.235 --> 00:08:28.916
when it is not necessary you should
not talk.

00:08:29.117 --> 00:08:34.361
So that kind of personality gradually
you can develop with Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:34.562 --> 00:08:41.802
that you will develop that wisdom how far
to go, how far not to go.

00:08:42.003 --> 00:08:45.067
Not to go is the quality of Shiva.

00:08:45.268 --> 00:08:51.169
He doesn’t do anything, He is just sitting
down there and watching the whole joke.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:58.350
He doesn’t do anything, but still, He’s
the one who has to watch:

00:08:58.551 --> 00:09:03.992
if He doesn’t watch, then the whole show
is over.

00:09:05.087 --> 00:09:11.800
If you understand that in not doing
anything, how much He’s doing!

00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:15.210
See the contrast: He’s doing nothing
as such.

00:09:15.411 --> 00:09:19.439
But He’s making everybody dance,
to please Him.

00:09:20.312 --> 00:09:24.247
In the same way, in one shot you have
both the natures:

00:09:24.448 --> 00:09:30.277
as Sahaja Yogis you can achieve that kind
of a balanced personality.

00:09:30.506 --> 00:09:37.297
It is for your good, for your evolution,
for your development.

00:09:37.507 --> 00:09:41.612
So today, all of you have a great chance
of evolving

00:09:41.813 --> 00:09:45.261
individually within yourself with Shiva
tattwa,

00:09:45.462 --> 00:09:52.339
which ultimately permeates into the whole.

00:09:53.228 --> 00:09:58.218
Kabira has said it in a beautiful couplet,
I don’t know if you people have understood,

00:09:58.419 --> 00:10:02.865
which is: (Hindi) “Man mamta ko
Thir kar launga”.

00:10:03.066 --> 00:10:09.509
"The compassion of my heart I will vibrate,
I will bring it out;

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:16.225
the compassion of my heart I will vibrate,
I’ll bring it out;

00:10:16.426 --> 00:10:21.947
“Aur paancho tattwa milaunga”,
and put it into the five elements."

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:24.651
See Kabira, do you follow him how great
he is?

00:10:24.861 --> 00:10:26.840
People talk of Kabir Das, see, he says
that,

00:10:27.041 --> 00:10:32.304
“Take it out of the heart and put it into
all the five elements.”

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.325
This is what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:35.526 --> 00:10:40.370
If you understand that, then you don’t have
to understand anything else.

00:10:40.571 --> 00:10:44.370
You have got it in your heart, become
the capitalist in your heart,

00:10:44.571 --> 00:10:47.404
and become a communist outside.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.648
If you can achieve this balance properly,
you have done it.

00:10:52.849 --> 00:10:59.047
And we can do it, we all of us put together
we will do it, we can achieve it;

00:10:59.248 --> 00:11:02.799
and we can show to the world that
everyone can achieve it.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.080
All ordinary human beings so-called will,
can become extraordinary.

00:11:09.281 --> 00:11:13.783
So today, we have to decide about ourselves
that we are going to do it,

00:11:13.984 --> 00:11:19.817
 we are going to be educated about it,
in a spiritual way, in a Sahaja way.

00:11:20.018 --> 00:11:23.211
And every moment if you watch yourself,
you can do it.

00:11:23.412 --> 00:11:26.894
And not to explain yourself, or to say,
“Oh, this happened to me,

00:11:27.095 --> 00:11:29.032
that happened to me”; that’s not the point.

00:11:29.233 --> 00:11:32.121
Many people tell Me like that, that’s
absurd.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:34.374
You challenge yourself: How can it
happen to you?

00:11:34.575 --> 00:11:37.391
Why don’t you do it? You should do it.
Why can’t you do it?

00:11:37.592 --> 00:11:41.195
Like that you take yourself to task and you
can work it out, I’m sure,

00:11:41.396 --> 00:11:44.764
because you have got the power with you.

00:11:45.917 --> 00:11:52.803
I bless you all for your spiritual
development

00:11:53.019 --> 00:12:02.529
and for your collectivity. Both things
must be looked after.

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:07.161
If you have spiritual development and
no collectivity, it is useless.

00:12:07.392 --> 00:12:13.310
If you have collectivity and spiritual
development none, it is useless.

00:12:13.511 --> 00:12:15.606
Combine it properly.

00:12:15.807 --> 00:12:23.837
So we have to take Shiva and establish Him
into the Virat.

00:12:24.038 --> 00:12:28.412
This is what we have to do, and if you
understand this point,

00:12:28.613 --> 00:12:31.402
your relationships with others also will be
good,

00:12:31.603 --> 00:12:35.158
permanent, of a very substantial nature.

00:12:35.359 --> 00:12:41.890
And the quality of Sahaja Yogis’ life will
be something very, very great.

00:12:42.091 --> 00:12:45.091
May God bless you all.
