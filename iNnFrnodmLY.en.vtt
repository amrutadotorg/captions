00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:13.729
Now, even there are Sahaja Yogis who asked me,

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.916
"Mother, how can we have love and compassion?"

00:00:16.997 --> 00:00:22.246
I mean, this is a question which many have asked me.

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:28.788
Now, the simple thing is that 
if you develop your thoughtless awareness

00:00:28.997 --> 00:00:32.997
in your meditation, in thoughtless awareness,

00:00:33.162 --> 00:00:37.329
you watch anything in thoughtless awareness, 
any relationship you see it

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:41.454
in thoughtless awareness, then you’ll be amazed

00:00:41.663 --> 00:00:46.121
how the gates of this compassion will open out.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.997
Thoughtless awareness opens your heart,

00:00:50.204 --> 00:00:54.454
but it doesn't go to one person or to another person,

00:00:54.686 --> 00:00:59.836
but it is throwing lights on all the sides of your being.

00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:09.169
Everybody is benefited, everybody has 
a divine feeling for you.

00:01:09.377 --> 00:01:18.669
Because this compassion is not linear, 
nor is it aggressive, but it just flows

00:01:18.836 --> 00:01:22.294
and smoothes and soothes everything

00:01:22.502 --> 00:01:27.825
that is chaotic, that is troublesome and that is painful.

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:36.019
“How to do meditation?”, many people ask Me.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.471
Don’t do anything

00:01:38.638 --> 00:01:42.346
to just go into thoughtless awareness.

00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:45.263
Try to go to the thoughtless awareness.

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:51.304
If you can get into that condition of thoughtless awareness,

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.721
you’ve done your job.

00:01:53.888 --> 00:01:56.346
Because that’s the point where

00:01:56.471 --> 00:02:01.012
you are with the truth, with the reality,

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:02.555
with the joy,

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:06.886
with everything that is so fundamental.

00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:11.821
And when you are meditating like that,

00:02:11.988 --> 00:02:14.863
thoughtless awareness,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.488
then you’ll be amazed how you are helped

00:02:19.654 --> 00:02:23.779
from within and without.

00:02:23.946 --> 00:02:26.905
It’s a terrible power that works,

00:02:27.071 --> 00:02:29.613
this thoughtless awareness.

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:34.071
So those who do not meditate

00:02:34.238 --> 00:02:36.821
cannot go very much far

00:02:36.988 --> 00:02:40.529
with the advantage of Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:40.696 --> 00:02:43.821
One should try to meditate

00:02:43.988 --> 00:02:48.571
and go up to the point of thoughtless awareness.

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:52.571
So, what happens to you?

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:55.905
If you are in thoughtless awareness,

00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:58.613
what happens to you?

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:06.613
Is that you get the confidence,

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.747
complete confidence of Divinity,

00:03:13.347 --> 00:03:17.138
Your depth is in thoughtless awareness.

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:22.263
Is a very important point which you should reach.

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:28.180
Looking at anything, if you are thoughtlessly aware,

00:03:28.305 --> 00:03:31.851
then you really become reflective about it,

00:03:32.237 --> 00:03:35.320
Main thing is: your connection with the Divine

00:03:35.522 --> 00:03:39.480
is only possible when you meditate

00:03:39.647 --> 00:03:43.022
and become thoughtlessly aware.

00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:49.313
That’s the point where Divine works.

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:51.564
It helps you.

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:57.022
It comes to your help in such a way

00:03:57.188 --> 00:04:02.188
that you don’t know how you have achieved it.

00:04:02.313 --> 00:04:06.605
So thoughtless awareness is the first point

00:04:06.772 --> 00:04:09.564
all of you should achieve.

00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:11.938
Very important.

00:04:12.105 --> 00:04:17.063
After that you can achieve something else,

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.147
but the first step is thoughtless awareness.

00:04:21.313 --> 00:04:27.514
Is very important to become thoughtlessly aware,

00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:34.677
I think is a reflecting mind.

00:04:34.844 --> 00:04:38.219
When you look at something,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.595
you will become thoughtlessly aware.

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:49.344
And then this mind reflects

00:04:49.802 --> 00:04:55.219
to the depth of what you see.

00:04:55.386 --> 00:04:58.386
That’s how you all will become really

00:04:58.553 --> 00:05:01.636
very creative Sahaja Yogis.

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:10.469
What I find, that this state of thoughtless awareness

00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:14.709
is not established by many, which is not good.

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:21.545
In case you meditate in the real sense of the word,

00:05:21.685 --> 00:05:25.226
then you will get into that thoughtless awareness.

00:05:25.351 --> 00:05:28.166
Which is a very important point

00:05:32.174 --> 00:05:35.049
You know about these three nadis we have:

00:05:35.322 --> 00:05:37.113
Ida, Pingala, Sushumna;

00:05:38.072 --> 00:05:41.197
but in the heart there are four nadis.

00:05:45.155 --> 00:05:49.489
And the one nadi goes to Mooladhara,

00:05:52.704 --> 00:05:56.745
and if you cross the limits of Mooladhara it goes to hell.

00:05:57.079 --> 00:06:01.412
That's why they say that Shiva is a destroyer.

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.579
Actually you ask for your destruction.

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:12.456
And when you ask for your destruction, you have it.

00:06:13.136 --> 00:06:17.594
One of the qualities of Shiva is that He's innocence.

00:06:18.273 --> 00:06:21.557
He's extremely innocent. He's innocent like a child.

00:06:21.885 --> 00:06:24.969
He is innocence personified.

00:06:27.814 --> 00:06:30.980
So

00:06:32.731 --> 00:06:39.314
we have to put our carnal desires,

00:06:40.397 --> 00:06:43.272
dissolve them,

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.814
dissolve them into the innocence,

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:53.439
the ocean of innocence.

00:06:56.147 --> 00:07:00.731
You have to dissolve it in the ocean of innocence.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:08.731
Innocence is something to be appreciated,

00:07:08.894 --> 00:07:13.272
to be understood, to be enjoyed.

00:07:13.689 --> 00:07:17.397
Like you see animals, they're innocent;

00:07:18.397 --> 00:07:23.147
you see children, they're innocent;

00:07:23.938 --> 00:07:26.147
flowers, they're innocent.

00:07:27.522 --> 00:07:31.439
Divert your attention

00:07:33.522 --> 00:07:36.244
to all these things.

00:07:39.844 --> 00:07:44.844
The second nadi, the second channel

00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:48.719
that can take you to destruction is desire.

00:07:48.997 --> 00:07:53.331
Desires can be of any kind, not only material.

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:58.914
The desires could be also

00:07:59.251 --> 00:08:01.459
quite mental,

00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:06.334
"I must possess this woman,

00:08:06.792 --> 00:08:09.668
I must possess this child."

00:08:10.334 --> 00:08:15.001
All kinds of possessions that work into you as desires.

00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:19.792
But I wouldn't say it is because of attachment.

00:08:21.792 --> 00:08:26.251
It's not attachment, but it is just to have more.

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:30.231
All these desires

00:08:31.356 --> 00:08:35.107
lead you ultimately to a destruction,

00:08:37.314 --> 00:08:39.523
because there's no joy,

00:08:39.981 --> 00:08:41.997
there's no happiness.

00:08:44.628 --> 00:08:47.628
Now the third nadi:

00:08:53.337 --> 00:08:56.337
third nadi

00:08:56.879 --> 00:09:00.795
is the nadi by which we feel attached,

00:09:02.795 --> 00:09:04.795
attached to someone.

00:09:05.129 --> 00:09:09.463
Like this is my child, this is my husband,

00:09:10.045 --> 00:09:12.171
this is my family,

00:09:12.463 --> 00:09:14.712
this is my wife,

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:18.810
this is my father, this is my mother.

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:22.642
Fourth one is the most important

00:09:23.183 --> 00:09:25.433
for all of us is to know

00:09:25.766 --> 00:09:29.642
that there's a nadi which passes through left Vishuddhi

00:09:31.016 --> 00:09:32.849
into the heart.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.433
Starts from the heart, goes up,

00:09:37.225 --> 00:09:39.308
passes through Agnya.

00:09:39.642 --> 00:09:43.350
It has four petals, and opens up.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.433
This is the one which gives

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:55.045
you the state which is called as turya.

00:09:55.138 --> 00:09:57.013
But the fourth state is called as turya.

00:09:57.094 --> 00:09:58.807
There are two more states.

00:09:58.888 --> 00:10:01.015
You are in the turya state, it's the fourth,

00:10:01.096 --> 00:10:02.805
"turya" means fourth.

00:10:03.221 --> 00:10:06.888
Fourth state is where that you are

00:10:07.263 --> 00:10:10.346
in a thoughtless awareness state.

00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:16.805
When there is no thought - just think of it

00:10:17.805 --> 00:10:21.888
- when there is no thought, you have to be innocent.

00:10:22.764 --> 00:10:27.263
When there is no thought, you have to have vibrations.

00:10:28.221 --> 00:10:32.138
When there is no thought, you cannot be attached to anyone.

00:10:33.138 --> 00:10:35.555
So into that thoughtless state you have come now,

00:10:35.805 --> 00:10:37.472
is the "turya sthiti."

00:10:37.764 --> 00:10:41.472
And in this state when you are,

00:10:43.263 --> 00:10:47.555
these four petals which are within you

00:10:48.096 --> 00:10:51.888
have to open out in your brain.

00:10:53.597 --> 00:10:57.096
They come from your heart to your brain.

00:11:00.346 --> 00:11:05.263
And that is when

00:11:07.764 --> 00:11:13.472
you absolutely understand what is God,

00:11:18.555 --> 00:11:23.388
absolutely you know what is God is.

00:11:25.472 --> 00:11:29.846
That is the time when

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.344
one receives the real knowledge.

00:11:39.895 --> 00:11:45.103
Now the first step is to become thoughtlessly aware,

00:11:45.312 --> 00:11:51.103
where you cross your mind. You go above your mind.

00:11:51.312 --> 00:11:53.112
Mind cannot affect you.

00:11:53.192 --> 00:11:57.145
This is the first stage as we call is thoughtless awareness.

00:11:57.354 --> 00:12:03.770
Second one is where, you see, start seeing 
the working of this Paramachaitanya,

00:12:03.978 --> 00:12:09.062
of this all-pervading Power and you start becoming aware

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:16.978
that there is lot of truth in what Mataji says.

00:12:17.187 --> 00:12:22.228
That there is this power, which works out many things.

00:12:22.395 --> 00:12:26.062
It works miraculously so many things for you.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:33.603
It gives you blessings, it guides you, it helps you, 
in so many ways it helps you.

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:40.395
It gives you good health, good wealth 
and also a very good society

00:12:40.603 --> 00:12:44.895
of very beautiful people in the collective.

00:12:45.103 --> 00:12:49.145
All that you can see clearly is happening here.

00:12:51.561 --> 00:12:57.561
Now this happening of

00:13:03.478 --> 00:13:11.354
achieving thoughtless awareness is very simple and easy,

00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:15.313
but to maintain at that point is difficult.

00:13:15.393 --> 00:13:20.020
We still react and we think.

00:13:20.228 --> 00:13:22.908
Anything you see you react.

00:13:22.988 --> 00:13:27.686
To get to that point in thoughtless awareness

00:13:27.895 --> 00:13:34.354
is first, to change your attention.

00:13:34.561 --> 00:13:38.334
Now for example, once we were climbing

00:13:38.415 --> 00:13:43.020
a very high mountain to see one temple

00:13:43.228 --> 00:13:48.228
called Palitana. Myself, My son-in-law and My daughter.

00:13:48.442 --> 00:13:53.068
And we were really tired because we had to climb 
- I don't know how many steps

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:56.519
and when we went up we were tired 
and there was a little canopy

00:13:56.686 --> 00:14:02.728
made of beautiful marble carving, 
so we just laid down ourselves.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:08.395
They were very tired and they said, 
"What is this kind of a temple," they were grudging.

00:14:08.603 --> 00:14:16.686
While I looked up and I saw lots of beautiful 
elephants were carved.

00:14:16.895 --> 00:14:20.312
So I told My son-in-law, "Look at these elephants,

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:23.811
they all have tails of different types."

00:14:23.978 --> 00:14:30.270
He said, "Mommy, we are all dying, 
how can You see the tails of elephants?"

00:14:30.478 --> 00:14:37.187
But is just to divert their attention 
from that tiredness, I told them that,

00:14:37.354 --> 00:14:42.145
why not see these tails of the elephant, 
which is very different.

00:14:42.354 --> 00:14:49.145
So what happens that when you are putting your attention

00:14:49.354 --> 00:14:53.062
so much to outside all the time,

00:14:53.686 --> 00:14:58.519
then you must first of all also divert your attention.

00:14:58.686 --> 00:15:02.978
For example, you see these beautifully made things here.

00:15:03.187 --> 00:15:07.895
Your attention is something else, just try 
to enjoy the beauty of that.

00:15:08.103 --> 00:15:13.811
See there are beautiful carpets here, 
just look at them without thinking,

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:16.406
because they don't belong to you so no headache,

00:15:16.487 --> 00:15:18.799
they belong to somebody else is very good.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.578
Otherwise if it belongs to you, you'll will start thinking,

00:15:21.659 --> 00:15:25.270
"Oh my God, I've spreading them here 
what will happen, they have to be insured”

00:15:25.436 --> 00:15:30.603
or some sort of thing like that. 
That's common human reaction

00:15:30.811 --> 00:15:34.270
but if it doesn't belong to you, you can watch it nicely.

00:15:34.478 --> 00:15:38.561
Now you watch it and don't think, you'll be amazed

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:42.478
when you see the beauty that is put inside this.

00:15:42.686 --> 00:15:47.354
You'll see the artist who has put his joy, 
his exuberance into it

00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:53.395
and you'll be amazed after realization that this exuberance

00:15:53.603 --> 00:16:00.312
will fill into you and a cool kind 
of a relaxation will come into you

00:16:00.519 --> 00:16:07.228
and this Kundalini will rise and you’ll become 
steady in your thoughtless awareness.

00:16:07.436 --> 00:16:15.561
So whenever you look at anything, 
look at any beautiful thing,

00:16:15.728 --> 00:16:21.603
even say today's election, just watch 
the man who is elected [John Howard].

00:16:21.811 --> 00:16:26.686
Watching him itself gives him blessings, 
gives him better ideas.

00:16:26.895 --> 00:16:34.145
You get also ideas which are 
coming from reality, which are there,

00:16:34.354 --> 00:16:42.811
how to make this man a successful person
 or this country a successful democracy.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:48.187
All these things happen when your attention is diverted

00:16:48.395 --> 00:16:54.895
from criticising, from reacting,

00:16:55.103 --> 00:16:59.978
just you watch, become the witness, 
try to witness everything.

00:17:00.145 --> 00:17:04.103
It's not so very yet practiced,

00:17:04.312 --> 00:17:10.686
so far I've seen, that whenever 
even we get our, achieve our realization

00:17:10.895 --> 00:17:15.603
we don't realize that we have to witness everything.

00:17:15.811 --> 00:17:20.228
When you start witnessing through 
your spirit, then you don't see

00:17:20.436 --> 00:17:24.811
the bad points of another, but you see the good points.

00:17:24.978 --> 00:17:30.645
We just pick up a person with very good points.

00:17:30.853 --> 00:17:38.020
So once you see that the witness state enlarges

00:17:38.228 --> 00:17:43.936
and you start enjoying another person, 
you start enjoying everything that is there.

00:17:44.145 --> 00:17:51.895
Even a small blade of grass you can enjoy
 if you have that capacity.

00:17:52.936 --> 00:17:58.395
In Japan Zen system started on these lines.

00:17:58.603 --> 00:18:04.561
And he made - Viditama was the person who started it.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:14.020
He made a garden out of moss, 
different moss, very small, small.

00:18:14.228 --> 00:18:20.686
There were little, little flowers also. 
And hardly about five feet of the garden,

00:18:20.895 --> 00:18:26.561
which looks like the shape of a question mark, you can say.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:32.020
You have to go on a lift and you reach that platform

00:18:32.228 --> 00:18:36.603
on top of a hill or a mountain where you see this.

00:18:36.811 --> 00:18:39.728
All little, little mosses are there

00:18:39.936 --> 00:18:44.645
and you see differently arranged a beautiful garden.

00:18:44.936 --> 00:18:49.312
When you start seeing it your thought stops.

00:18:49.478 --> 00:18:53.312
Because such a marvelous thing, 
when you put attention to it,

00:18:53.478 --> 00:18:57.603
to its creation, your thoughts stop. So you must practice

00:18:57.811 --> 00:19:04.978
as to find out what stops your thoughts. 
What makes you the witness?

00:19:05.187 --> 00:19:10.395
Once you develop this habit you will station yourself nicely

00:19:10.603 --> 00:19:15.228
in the thoughtless awareness. Then you start watching

00:19:15.436 --> 00:19:22.145
how Sahaja Yoga has helped you. How it has been blissful.

00:19:22.312 --> 00:19:25.895
What you have achieved through Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:26.103 --> 00:19:29.857
You will be amazed if you just start watching it

00:19:29.963 --> 00:19:36.365
everywhere you'll be amazed how this Paramachaitanya acts.
