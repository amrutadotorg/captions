00:10.371 --> 00:13.729
Now, even there are Sahaja Yogis who asked me,

00:13.810 --> 00:16.916
"Mother, how can we have love and compassion?"

00:16.997 --> 00:22.246
I mean, this is a question which many have asked me.

00:22.454 --> 00:28.788
Now, the simple thing is that
if you develop your thoughtless awareness

00:28.997 --> 00:32.997
in your meditation, in thoughtless awareness,

00:33.162 --> 00:37.329
you watch anything in thoughtless awareness,
any relationship you see it

00:37.538 --> 00:41.454
in thoughtless awareness, then you’ll be amazed

00:41.663 --> 00:46.121
how the gates of this compassion will open out.

00:46.329 --> 00:49.997
Thoughtless awareness opens your heart,

00:50.204 --> 00:54.454
but it doesn't go to one person or to another person,

00:54.686 --> 00:59.836
but it is throwing lights on all the sides of your being.

01:00.045 --> 01:09.169
Everybody is benefited, everybody has
a divine feeling for you.

01:09.377 --> 01:18.669
Because this compassion is not linear,
nor is it aggressive, but it just flows

01:18.836 --> 01:22.294
and smoothes and soothes everything

01:22.502 --> 01:27.825
that is chaotic, that is troublesome and that is painful.

01:31.879 --> 01:36.019
“How to do meditation?”, many people ask Me.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.471
Don’t do anything

01:38.638 --> 01:42.346
to just go into thoughtless awareness.

01:42.471 --> 01:45.263
Try to go to the thoughtless awareness.

01:45.429 --> 01:51.304
If you can get into that condition of thoughtless awareness,

01:51.429 --> 01:53.721
you’ve done your job.

01:53.888 --> 01:56.346
Because that’s the point where

01:56.471 --> 02:01.012
you are with the truth, with the reality,

02:01.179 --> 02:02.555
with the joy,

02:02.721 --> 02:06.886
with everything that is so fundamental.

02:07.834 --> 02:11.821
And when you are meditating like that,

02:11.988 --> 02:14.863
thoughtless awareness,

02:15.030 --> 02:19.488
then you’ll be amazed how you are helped

02:19.654 --> 02:23.779
from within and without.

02:23.946 --> 02:26.905
It’s a terrible power that works,

02:27.071 --> 02:29.613
this thoughtless awareness.

02:29.779 --> 02:34.071
So those who do not meditate

02:34.238 --> 02:36.821
cannot go very much far

02:36.988 --> 02:40.529
with the advantage of Sahaja Yoga.

02:40.696 --> 02:43.821
One should try to meditate

02:43.988 --> 02:48.571
and go up to the point of thoughtless awareness.

02:49.279 --> 02:52.571
So, what happens to you?

02:52.738 --> 02:55.905
If you are in thoughtless awareness,

02:56.071 --> 02:58.613
what happens to you?

02:58.779 --> 03:06.613
Is that you get the confidence,

03:06.760 --> 03:11.747
complete confidence of Divinity,

03:13.347 --> 03:17.138
Your depth is in thoughtless awareness.

03:17.263 --> 03:22.263
Is a very important point which you should reach.

03:22.389 --> 03:28.180
Looking at anything, if you are thoughtlessly aware,

03:28.305 --> 03:31.851
then you really become reflective about it,

03:32.237 --> 03:35.320
Main thing is: your connection with the Divine

03:35.522 --> 03:39.480
is only possible when you meditate

03:39.647 --> 03:43.022
and become thoughtlessly aware.

03:43.188 --> 03:49.313
That’s the point where Divine works.

03:49.439 --> 03:51.564
It helps you.

03:51.731 --> 03:57.022
It comes to your help in such a way

03:57.188 --> 04:02.188
that you don’t know how you have achieved it.

04:02.313 --> 04:06.605
So thoughtless awareness is the first point

04:06.772 --> 04:09.564
all of you should achieve.

04:09.731 --> 04:11.938
Very important.

04:12.105 --> 04:17.063
After that you can achieve something else,

04:17.230 --> 04:21.147
but the first step is thoughtless awareness.

04:21.313 --> 04:27.514
Is very important to become thoughtlessly aware,

04:28.261 --> 04:34.677
I think is a reflecting mind.

04:34.844 --> 04:38.219
When you look at something,

04:39.760 --> 04:43.595
you will become thoughtlessly aware.

04:44.219 --> 04:49.344
And then this mind reflects

04:49.802 --> 04:55.219
to the depth of what you see.

04:55.386 --> 04:58.386
That’s how you all will become really

04:58.553 --> 05:01.636
very creative Sahaja Yogis.

05:01.802 --> 05:10.469
What I find, that this state of thoughtless awareness

05:10.642 --> 05:14.709
is not established by many, which is not good.

05:15.269 --> 05:21.545
In case you meditate in the real sense of the word,

05:21.685 --> 05:25.226
then you will get into that thoughtless awareness.

05:25.351 --> 05:28.166
Which is a very important point

05:32.174 --> 05:35.049
You know about these three nadis we have:

05:35.322 --> 05:37.113
Ida, Pingala, Sushumna;

05:38.072 --> 05:41.197
but in the heart there are four nadis.

05:45.155 --> 05:49.489
And the one nadi goes to Mooladhara,

05:52.704 --> 05:56.745
and if you cross the limits of Mooladhara it goes to hell.

05:57.079 --> 06:01.412
That's why they say that Shiva is a destroyer.

06:01.870 --> 06:05.579
Actually you ask for your destruction.

06:07.579 --> 06:12.456
And when you ask for your destruction, you have it.

06:13.136 --> 06:17.594
One of the qualities of Shiva is that He's innocence.

06:18.273 --> 06:21.557
He's extremely innocent. He's innocent like a child.

06:21.885 --> 06:24.969
He is innocence personified.

06:27.814 --> 06:30.980
So

06:32.731 --> 06:39.314
we have to put our carnal desires,

06:40.397 --> 06:43.272
dissolve them,

06:44.980 --> 06:49.814
dissolve them into the innocence,

06:50.189 --> 06:53.439
the ocean of innocence.

06:56.147 --> 07:00.731
You have to dissolve it in the ocean of innocence.

07:02.980 --> 07:08.731
Innocence is something to be appreciated,

07:08.894 --> 07:13.272
to be understood, to be enjoyed.

07:13.689 --> 07:17.397
Like you see animals, they're innocent;

07:18.397 --> 07:23.147
you see children, they're innocent;

07:23.938 --> 07:26.147
flowers, they're innocent.

07:27.522 --> 07:31.439
Divert your attention

07:33.522 --> 07:36.244
to all these things.

07:39.844 --> 07:44.844
The second nadi, the second channel

07:45.261 --> 07:48.719
that can take you to destruction is desire.

07:48.997 --> 07:53.331
Desires can be of any kind, not only material.

07:53.790 --> 07:58.914
The desires could be also

07:59.251 --> 08:01.459
quite mental,

08:03.501 --> 08:06.334
"I must possess this woman,

08:06.792 --> 08:09.668
I must possess this child."

08:10.334 --> 08:15.001
All kinds of possessions that work into you as desires.

08:16.251 --> 08:19.792
But I wouldn't say it is because of attachment.

08:21.792 --> 08:26.251
It's not attachment, but it is just to have more.

08:28.107 --> 08:30.231
All these desires

08:31.356 --> 08:35.107
lead you ultimately to a destruction,

08:37.314 --> 08:39.523
because there's no joy,

08:39.981 --> 08:41.997
there's no happiness.

08:44.628 --> 08:47.628
Now the third nadi:

08:53.337 --> 08:56.337
third nadi

08:56.879 --> 09:00.795
is the nadi by which we feel attached,

09:02.795 --> 09:04.795
attached to someone.

09:05.129 --> 09:09.463
Like this is my child, this is my husband,

09:10.045 --> 09:12.171
this is my family,

09:12.463 --> 09:14.712
this is my wife,

09:15.421 --> 09:18.810
this is my father, this is my mother.

09:19.350 --> 09:22.642
Fourth one is the most important

09:23.183 --> 09:25.433
for all of us is to know

09:25.766 --> 09:29.642
that there's a nadi which passes through left Vishuddhi

09:31.016 --> 09:32.849
into the heart.

09:33.100 --> 09:36.433
Starts from the heart, goes up,

09:37.225 --> 09:39.308
passes through Agnya.

09:39.642 --> 09:43.350
It has four petals, and opens up.

09:48.350 --> 09:51.433
This is the one which gives

09:52.058 --> 09:55.045
you the state which is called as turya.

09:55.138 --> 09:57.013
But the fourth state is called as turya.

09:57.094 --> 09:58.807
There are two more states.

09:58.888 --> 10:01.015
You are in the turya state, it's the fourth,

10:01.096 --> 10:02.805
"turya" means fourth.

10:03.221 --> 10:06.888
Fourth state is where that you are

10:07.263 --> 10:10.346
in a thoughtless awareness state.

10:11.971 --> 10:16.805
When there is no thought - just think of it

10:17.805 --> 10:21.888
- when there is no thought, you have to be innocent.

10:22.764 --> 10:27.263
When there is no thought, you have to have vibrations.

10:28.221 --> 10:32.138
When there is no thought, you cannot be attached to anyone.

10:33.138 --> 10:35.555
So into that thoughtless state you have come now,

10:35.805 --> 10:37.472
is the "turya sthiti."

10:37.764 --> 10:41.472
And in this state when you are,

10:43.263 --> 10:47.555
these four petals which are within you

10:48.096 --> 10:51.888
have to open out in your brain.

10:53.597 --> 10:57.096
They come from your heart to your brain.

11:00.346 --> 11:05.263
And that is when

11:07.764 --> 11:13.472
you absolutely understand what is God,

11:18.555 --> 11:23.388
absolutely you know what is God is.

11:25.472 --> 11:29.846
That is the time when

11:32.680 --> 11:36.344
one receives the real knowledge.

11:39.895 --> 11:45.103
Now the first step is to become thoughtlessly aware,

11:45.312 --> 11:51.103
where you cross your mind. You go above your mind.

11:51.312 --> 11:53.112
Mind cannot affect you.

11:53.192 --> 11:57.145
This is the first stage as we call is thoughtless awareness.

11:57.354 --> 12:03.770
Second one is where, you see, start seeing
the working of this Paramachaitanya,

12:03.978 --> 12:09.062
of this all-pervading Power and you start becoming aware

12:09.228 --> 12:16.978
that there is lot of truth in what Mataji says.

12:17.187 --> 12:22.228
That there is this power, which works out many things.

12:22.395 --> 12:26.062
It works miraculously so many things for you.

12:26.270 --> 12:33.603
It gives you blessings, it guides you, it helps you,
in so many ways it helps you.

12:33.770 --> 12:40.395
It gives you good health, good wealth
and also a very good society

12:40.603 --> 12:44.895
of very beautiful people in the collective.

12:45.103 --> 12:49.145
All that you can see clearly is happening here.

12:51.561 --> 12:57.561
Now this happening of

13:03.478 --> 13:11.354
achieving thoughtless awareness is very simple and easy,

13:11.561 --> 13:15.313
but to maintain at that point is difficult.

13:15.393 --> 13:20.020
We still react and we think.

13:20.228 --> 13:22.908
Anything you see you react.

13:22.988 --> 13:27.686
To get to that point in thoughtless awareness

13:27.895 --> 13:34.354
is first, to change your attention.

13:34.561 --> 13:38.334
Now for example, once we were climbing

13:38.415 --> 13:43.020
a very high mountain to see one temple

13:43.228 --> 13:48.228
called Palitana. Myself, My son-in-law and My daughter.

13:48.442 --> 13:53.068
And we were really tired because we had to climb
- I don't know how many steps

13:53.270 --> 13:56.519
and when we went up we were tired
and there was a little canopy

13:56.686 --> 14:02.728
made of beautiful marble carving,
so we just laid down ourselves.

14:03.020 --> 14:08.395
They were very tired and they said,
"What is this kind of a temple," they were grudging.

14:08.603 --> 14:16.686
While I looked up and I saw lots of beautiful
elephants were carved.

14:16.895 --> 14:20.312
So I told My son-in-law, "Look at these elephants,

14:20.519 --> 14:23.811
they all have tails of different types."

14:23.978 --> 14:30.270
He said, "Mommy, we are all dying,
how can You see the tails of elephants?"

14:30.478 --> 14:37.187
But is just to divert their attention
from that tiredness, I told them that,

14:37.354 --> 14:42.145
why not see these tails of the elephant,
which is very different.

14:42.354 --> 14:49.145
So what happens that when you are putting your attention

14:49.354 --> 14:53.062
so much to outside all the time,

14:53.686 --> 14:58.519
then you must first of all also divert your attention.

14:58.686 --> 15:02.978
For example, you see these beautifully made things here.

15:03.187 --> 15:07.895
Your attention is something else, just try
to enjoy the beauty of that.

15:08.103 --> 15:13.811
See there are beautiful carpets here,
just look at them without thinking,

15:14.020 --> 15:16.406
because they don't belong to you so no headache,

15:16.487 --> 15:18.799
they belong to somebody else is very good.

15:18.880 --> 15:21.578
Otherwise if it belongs to you, you'll will start thinking,

15:21.659 --> 15:25.270
"Oh my God, I've spreading them here
what will happen, they have to be insured”

15:25.436 --> 15:30.603
or some sort of thing like that.
That's common human reaction

15:30.811 --> 15:34.270
but if it doesn't belong to you, you can watch it nicely.

15:34.478 --> 15:38.561
Now you watch it and don't think, you'll be amazed

15:38.770 --> 15:42.478
when you see the beauty that is put inside this.

15:42.686 --> 15:47.354
You'll see the artist who has put his joy,
his exuberance into it

15:47.519 --> 15:53.395
and you'll be amazed after realization that this exuberance

15:53.603 --> 16:00.312
will fill into you and a cool kind
of a relaxation will come into you

16:00.519 --> 16:07.228
and this Kundalini will rise and you’ll become
steady in your thoughtless awareness.

16:07.436 --> 16:15.561
So whenever you look at anything,
look at any beautiful thing,

16:15.728 --> 16:21.603
even say today's election, just watch
the man who is elected [John Howard].

16:21.811 --> 16:26.686
Watching him itself gives him blessings,
gives him better ideas.

16:26.895 --> 16:34.145
You get also ideas which are
coming from reality, which are there,

16:34.354 --> 16:42.811
how to make this man a successful person
or this country a successful democracy.

16:43.020 --> 16:48.187
All these things happen when your attention is diverted

16:48.395 --> 16:54.895
from criticising, from reacting,

16:55.103 --> 16:59.978
just you watch, become the witness,
try to witness everything.

17:00.145 --> 17:04.103
It's not so very yet practiced,

17:04.312 --> 17:10.686
so far I've seen, that whenever
even we get our, achieve our realization

17:10.895 --> 17:15.603
we don't realize that we have to witness everything.

17:15.811 --> 17:20.228
When you start witnessing through
your spirit, then you don't see

17:20.436 --> 17:24.811
the bad points of another, but you see the good points.

17:24.978 --> 17:30.645
We just pick up a person with very good points.

17:30.853 --> 17:38.020
So once you see that the witness state enlarges

17:38.228 --> 17:43.936
and you start enjoying another person,
you start enjoying everything that is there.

17:44.145 --> 17:51.895
Even a small blade of grass you can enjoy
if you have that capacity.

17:52.936 --> 17:58.395
In Japan Zen system started on these lines.

17:58.603 --> 18:04.561
And he made - Viditama was the person who started it.

18:04.770 --> 18:14.020
He made a garden out of moss,
different moss, very small, small.

18:14.228 --> 18:20.686
There were little, little flowers also.
And hardly about five feet of the garden,

18:20.895 --> 18:26.561
which looks like the shape of a question mark, you can say.

18:26.770 --> 18:32.020
You have to go on a lift and you reach that platform

18:32.228 --> 18:36.603
on top of a hill or a mountain where you see this.

18:36.811 --> 18:39.728
All little, little mosses are there

18:39.936 --> 18:44.645
and you see differently arranged a beautiful garden.

18:44.936 --> 18:49.312
When you start seeing it your thought stops.

18:49.478 --> 18:53.312
Because such a marvelous thing,
when you put attention to it,

18:53.478 --> 18:57.603
to its creation, your thoughts stop. So you must practice

18:57.811 --> 19:04.978
as to find out what stops your thoughts.
What makes you the witness?

19:05.187 --> 19:10.395
Once you develop this habit you will station yourself nicely

19:10.603 --> 19:15.228
in the thoughtless awareness. Then you start watching

19:15.436 --> 19:22.145
how Sahaja Yoga has helped you. How it has been blissful.

19:22.312 --> 19:25.895
What you have achieved through Sahaja Yoga.

19:26.103 --> 19:29.857
You will be amazed if you just start watching it

19:29.963 --> 19:36.365
everywhere you'll be amazed how this Paramachaitanya acts.
