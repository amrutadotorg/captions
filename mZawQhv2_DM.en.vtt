WEBVTT

00:05.309 --> 00:09.190
This is the first time we are having a puja in Brisbane,

00:10.150 --> 00:13.150
and I'm happy so many have come here

00:13.230 --> 00:15.470
from various places.

00:19.230 --> 00:21.070
You know that by puja you,

00:21.190 --> 00:25.070
you excite the Chakras within Me

00:26.350 --> 00:30.230
and you get lots of vibrations,

00:32.230 --> 00:34.310
and you achieve,

00:34.630 --> 00:37.950
suddenly, a height in your awareness.

00:41.110 --> 00:43.110
You do achieve that, but

00:44.470 --> 00:46.990
after some time they say that:

00:47.110 --> 00:49.550
Mother, again we come down.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.630
Also, they were saying that:

00:52.950 --> 00:55.830
"When we go to India we are all right,

00:55.910 --> 00:58.910
and when we come back, again we come down."

01:01.310 --> 01:03.150
Luckily, now we have an Ashram,

01:03.230 --> 01:04.830
which is a very good thing.

01:04.910 --> 01:08.030
To have an ashram itself is a, I must say,

01:08.110 --> 01:09.750
is a very, very

01:11.630 --> 01:13.150
positive thing because

01:13.230 --> 01:15.950
that is how Ganesha is established here.

01:22.190 --> 01:25.070
So Ashram is here for a collective living,

01:27.910 --> 01:31.950
but a collective living of spirituality.

01:32.870 --> 01:36.790
It's not just living here, but it is of spirituality.

01:37.950 --> 01:42.790
And we have to know certain things about

01:43.270 --> 01:45.230
the discipline that we have to keep,

01:45.310 --> 01:47.750
which is very important.

01:47.910 --> 01:50.070
It's not just a house where are, some people

01:50.230 --> 01:52.590
have gathered together to live together,

01:52.670 --> 01:56.630
but it has to have a discipline.

01:59.870 --> 02:02.230
Then only you'll be helped

02:02.310 --> 02:04.750
because if you do not come

02:04.830 --> 02:07.230
to the Ashram with this idea

02:07.310 --> 02:10.390
that you are going there to ascend yourself,

02:12.390 --> 02:14.030
it will make no difference

02:14.110 --> 02:15.150
whether you stay in the house

02:15.230 --> 02:17.230
or you go in the Ashram.

02:22.950 --> 02:26.110
So there are two types of meditation,

02:27.310 --> 02:28.830
two types,

02:29.390 --> 02:32.830
where one is the meditation where -

02:33.790 --> 02:36.030
we can call it the antarmana -

02:36.110 --> 02:38.630
that we meditate inside ourselves,

02:40.110 --> 02:43.390
to see for ourselves what's wrong with us,

02:44.230 --> 02:46.030
and how we have to correct,

02:46.110 --> 02:47.710
what we have to do about it.

02:48.470 --> 02:51.270
And another is bahir mana,

02:51.710 --> 02:53.710
which is outside,

02:54.030 --> 02:57.030
how we have to live outside.

02:57.110 --> 02:59.390
You have to have a discipline,

02:59.470 --> 03:02.110
which is not imposed on you

03:02.430 --> 03:04.710
but, very happily,

03:04.870 --> 03:06.670
which you have

03:09.230 --> 03:10.990
accepted

03:11.630 --> 03:13.670
and have imbibed.

03:16.470 --> 03:20.870
For any art, say in India, I don't know here, but

03:21.110 --> 03:26.990
you have to put yourself into a rigorous training

03:27.070 --> 03:30.070
to achieve any height.

03:31.630 --> 03:34.510
You cannot haphazardly move about it.

03:35.550 --> 03:39.030
You cannot take just easily everything.

03:39.750 --> 03:42.070
In Sahaja Yoga there is no tapascharya,

03:42.150 --> 03:44.710
there is no penance for you.

03:44.870 --> 03:46.510
It's all blessings.

03:46.910 --> 03:50.190
But one should not get lost with those blessings,

03:50.510 --> 03:53.590
if you have to really get into yourself

03:53.870 --> 03:56.190
in its full depth.

03:58.750 --> 04:04.150
So, for the antarmana it is important

04:04.230 --> 04:07.110
that you all should meditate,

04:07.190 --> 04:10.670
morning and evening, every day.

04:10.910 --> 04:14.830
Is all right even if you do not brush your teeth,

04:16.310 --> 04:20.070
but you must meditate is an important thing.

04:21.110 --> 04:24.030
That is the reason I find that in the West

04:24.150 --> 04:26.030
people go on catching,

04:26.110 --> 04:28.070
again cleaning, again catching.

04:28.150 --> 04:31.750
Every time I come... [I] find somebody is suffering

04:31.830 --> 04:34.230
from either... for some sort of a conditioning,

04:34.310 --> 04:36.670
or say, some sort of a baddha,

04:36.750 --> 04:40.190
or sometimes it's ego or something.

04:40.310 --> 04:42.150
It comes and goes.

04:42.230 --> 04:48.590
It is not something that is detached permanently.

04:51.110 --> 04:53.310
As we have to take our bath every day,

04:53.390 --> 04:56.350
we have to wash ourselves every day,

04:56.430 --> 05:00.070
in the same way we have to wash ourselves within.

05:00.150 --> 05:04.110
So meditation is the antarmana

05:05.550 --> 05:07.590
tapaha, as you can call it.

05:07.670 --> 05:09.830
But it's not such a Tapaha even.

05:09.910 --> 05:13.030
You don't have to go to Himalayas and sit there.

05:13.350 --> 05:16.670
You have to just do this meditation

05:18.270 --> 05:20.350
early in the morning.

05:20.750 --> 05:24.350
In the Sahaja Yoga system,

05:25.310 --> 05:28.830
I would say the best that is working out

05:28.910 --> 05:32.110
is in Germany and in Austria, these two;

05:33.630 --> 05:35.910
and also England, but not to that extent.

05:35.990 --> 05:39.350
I would say these two are working out the best;

05:39.430 --> 05:42.910
and thirdly, in Rome.

05:43.790 --> 05:47.070
They too have ashrams of the same kind,

05:48.590 --> 05:53.150
but for them it is very important to achieve

05:53.470 --> 05:55.550
the heights of Sahaja Yoga.

05:55.630 --> 05:58.870
Absolutely. Nothing is more important.

05:59.110 --> 06:01.070
Invariably, in all these ashrams

06:01.150 --> 06:02.910
I've seen people get up at four o'clock.

06:02.990 --> 06:05.310
I also get up every day at four.

06:05.390 --> 06:07.150
Then I may sleep later on,

06:07.230 --> 06:09.470
but at four o'clock I am up.

06:09.550 --> 06:11.590
They take their baths,

06:11.750 --> 06:14.310
get ready for the pujas,

06:15.310 --> 06:17.230
and then sit down and do about

06:17.390 --> 06:20.950
five, ten minutes puja of the photograph,

06:21.870 --> 06:23.790
and then meditate.

06:25.390 --> 06:28.430
Then they go and have some breakfast or something.

06:31.350 --> 06:36.870
Then when they come home from work,

06:38.390 --> 06:42.430
also they sit down together to meditate,

06:42.510 --> 06:44.910
that's the collective part of it,

06:45.150 --> 06:47.150
or discuss whatever is to be done, what,

06:47.230 --> 06:49.910
how are we to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

06:49.990 --> 06:52.710
They just talk about Sahaja Yoga,

06:53.230 --> 06:55.270
or they decide what should be done,

06:55.350 --> 06:57.110
what is the best way

06:57.190 --> 07:00.110
to solve the problems of Sahaja Yoga.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.230
And then in the night, before sleeping,

07:05.310 --> 07:08.230
invariably all of them,  all of them,

07:08.310 --> 07:10.910
one and all, even children before sleeping,

07:11.590 --> 07:14.470
soak their feet in the water,

07:14.550 --> 07:17.110
sit for meditation, and sleep.

07:18.030 --> 07:22.430
That's why I find Austria has come up so well,

07:23.310 --> 07:25.870
and Germans.

07:25.950 --> 07:28.110
You know, Germans are like that.

07:28.310 --> 07:30.830
If something gets into their heads,

07:31.110 --> 07:34.030
for them that's the most important thing;

07:34.110 --> 07:36.070
then they do not sort of fickle out.

07:36.150 --> 07:37.150
There's no...

07:37.230 --> 07:40.110
they don't have any compromises on those points.

07:40.230 --> 07:42.830
And they make their body work hard.

07:42.990 --> 07:45.830
Now, what is the Tapa in this thing here

07:46.310 --> 07:47.670
- the penance?

07:47.750 --> 07:52.110
That our body is used to some sort of a life.

07:52.190 --> 07:54.150
India also, we are all like that in India

07:54.230 --> 07:56.390
- everybody will get up in the morning,

07:56.470 --> 07:58.350
and they will sit for puja,

07:58.430 --> 08:00.030
or they will sit for meditation.

08:00.110 --> 08:01.310
I mean, that goes without saying,

08:01.390 --> 08:03.470
you don't have to tell them.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.990
Because that's the traditional thing to do in India:

08:07.070 --> 08:09.390
always when they get up, have their bath,

08:09.470 --> 08:11.830
they always do some puja,

08:12.550 --> 08:13.950
all of them.

08:14.790 --> 08:18.030
If they're Christians, also, they'll sit down and pray.

08:19.470 --> 08:21.510
Muslims, they'll do namaaz.

08:21.590 --> 08:24.230
That's a kind of a practice,

08:24.470 --> 08:27.790
and the breeding of the family.

08:28.910 --> 08:30.550
Here I find that the parents

08:30.630 --> 08:32.230
do not take the responsibility

08:32.310 --> 08:35.630
to pass on any information to children

08:35.710 --> 08:37.710
about disciplining themselves,

08:37.790 --> 08:40.350
because children are also extremely aggressive.

08:42.790 --> 08:45.310
They don't want to know about it.

08:46.670 --> 08:49.030
So the parents also dare not tell them

08:49.110 --> 08:51.270
that: "It is good for you, please do it this way;

08:51.350 --> 08:53.910
it is better that you meditate."

08:56.590 --> 08:58.870
They're afraid that they may lose their children

08:58.950 --> 09:00.430
if they tell them like this.

09:00.510 --> 09:03.150
Or, "You pray", or "You get up at this time".

09:03.230 --> 09:06.150
You dare not tell them that you get up at this time.

09:06.230 --> 09:08.870
This is the greatest crime in the West

09:08.950 --> 09:10.030
if you tell them that:

09:10.110 --> 09:12.790
"You have to get up at four o'clock" - amah!

09:12.870 --> 09:15.710
It's like the worst punishment.

09:18.830 --> 09:21.630
But once you start getting up in the morning,

09:21.710 --> 09:25.070
you'll get the habit, and then you'll sleep early.

09:30.230 --> 09:32.030
Then you can sleep early.

09:32.110 --> 09:34.030
Getting up in the morning, really,

09:34.110 --> 09:36.350
will help you for the whole day.

09:36.430 --> 09:39.910
So start this kind of a practice.

09:40.390 --> 09:42.910
You must meditate every day,

09:42.990 --> 09:45.910
and this is the reason why I find people,

09:46.390 --> 09:48.510
whenever I come, they're again caught up,

09:48.590 --> 09:49.590
something gone wrong.

09:49.670 --> 09:51.190
This is wrong, that is wrong;

09:51.270 --> 09:54.630
they're caught up here and there. Why should you?

09:54.990 --> 09:57.710
Day by day, you must rise.

09:57.830 --> 10:01.630
Day by day, you should be at a much higher state,

10:02.150 --> 10:06.070
and this new breeding has to come within us,

10:06.150 --> 10:08.230
that we are Sahaja Yogis.

10:09.510 --> 10:11.550
And we are not here only,

10:11.630 --> 10:17.910
just to have good food and to have a nice time

10:18.030 --> 10:21.830
or nice meetings, but we are here

10:21.950 --> 10:27.990
to become those unique personalities,

10:28.070 --> 10:31.910
which are required to raise the humanity

10:31.990 --> 10:34.110
to a higher state.

10:35.270 --> 10:39.070
So you have to be, now, responsible for yourself.

10:39.910 --> 10:42.510
You have to look after yourself

10:42.630 --> 10:44.550
and you have to tell yourself:

10:44.710 --> 10:46.870
"Mr. So-and-so, Mrs. So-and-so,

10:46.950 --> 10:48.950
please now behave yourself."

10:50.310 --> 10:52.990
Otherwise, Sahaja Yoga is lost to you.

10:53.390 --> 10:55.710
It's not going to help you much.

10:57.230 --> 11:02.150
We might increase in quantity,

11:02.230 --> 11:04.950
but quality-wise we'll be missing;

11:05.470 --> 11:09.150
and one attack of negativity can finish

11:09.230 --> 11:12.310
such a quantity that we think is too much

11:12.390 --> 11:14.670
- it has happened once.

11:16.950 --> 11:19.950
So now, all of you must develop

11:20.550 --> 11:25.390
that dedication to yourself,

11:27.470 --> 11:31.150
to find out what's your problem,

11:32.030 --> 11:34.870
and how you have to correct it.

11:36.390 --> 11:40.030
If it is done every day, I can assure you,

11:40.110 --> 11:43.230
you will have no problem of any kind.

11:43.830 --> 11:46.310
Your thoughts will stop,

11:47.790 --> 11:50.510
your problems will be solved,

11:52.630 --> 11:55.150
and you'll have no catches at all,

11:55.230 --> 11:57.070
because you have washed them off.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.390
But if you leave them on your being,

11:59.470 --> 12:03.070
then they grow, and they become big.

12:04.790 --> 12:07.110
So there should be no lethargy,

12:07.190 --> 12:09.870
as far as meditation is concerned,

12:09.950 --> 12:13.750
but joyfully you'll start doing, after some time.

12:13.910 --> 12:16.950
You won't be happy if you have not done it.

12:17.030 --> 12:19.510
But in the beginning you'll have to goad yourself,

12:19.590 --> 12:21.350
and tell yourself

12:21.430 --> 12:26.830
that this body has to be cleaned;

12:26.910 --> 12:29.470
but more than that body,

12:29.670 --> 12:32.750
this mind and intellect, both of them,

12:32.870 --> 12:35.350
are to be corrected.

12:36.150 --> 12:38.910
To be an instrument of God,

12:38.990 --> 12:41.030
you have to be perfect,

12:41.310 --> 12:43.310
perfect personality,

12:43.390 --> 12:46.070
otherwise we may not be able to communicate

12:46.150 --> 12:49.870
the message of Sahaja Yoga in the proper way.

12:51.430 --> 12:53.030
Many people say that:

12:53.110 --> 12:55.830
"We are surrendered to Mother,

12:56.110 --> 12:58.070
and we are surrendered to Her,

12:58.150 --> 13:01.230
and as surrendering we'll get everything."

13:02.550 --> 13:04.990
But what are you surrendering?

13:05.070 --> 13:07.430
Is that a clean heart,

13:07.510 --> 13:12.070
or a heart full of all kinds of wrong things?

13:16.310 --> 13:18.470
Or is that the intelligence,

13:18.550 --> 13:22.270
which is a very superior type of clean intelligence?

13:22.350 --> 13:26.110
Or else, are you coming out

13:26.190 --> 13:28.990
with all your arrogance?

13:32.590 --> 13:37.070
So though there is the Ganges of Sahaja Yoga flowing,

13:38.470 --> 13:43.230
still you have to have the depth of a pitcher.

13:43.430 --> 13:47.110
A stone cannot fetch any water.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.310
Same with children.

13:51.470 --> 13:53.470
Of course, as they'll be going to India,

13:53.550 --> 13:56.190
I am sure they'll form proper routines,

13:56.350 --> 14:01.070
and they'll form proper meditation methods.

14:04.590 --> 14:07.790
It is obvious that we have never had

14:07.870 --> 14:11.830
the sense of Divinity in the West.

14:11.910 --> 14:14.470
Whatever we had, whatever we got

14:14.550 --> 14:17.150
from the church or from any

14:17.750 --> 14:20.270
synagogue or something like that,

14:20.550 --> 14:23.110
which was only Sunday to Sunday, Sunday to Sunday;

14:23.310 --> 14:26.350
for a Muslim it is Friday to Friday, Friday to Friday,

14:27.390 --> 14:29.150
finished.

14:30.390 --> 14:33.070
But that has led them nowhere.

14:33.510 --> 14:36.310
So we have to do something about it.

14:37.350 --> 14:40.430
Problems will be solved in no time.

14:40.830 --> 14:43.350
You don't have to sit down and contemplate

14:43.430 --> 14:45.390
and worry: how will you solve your problem?

14:45.470 --> 14:47.390
It will be solved.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.230
But what cannot be solved

14:49.310 --> 14:52.390
is the habits you have developed,

14:52.470 --> 14:55.710
habits of lethargy.

14:56.870 --> 14:58.990
I can understand in London

14:59.110 --> 15:01.750
if the people are lethargic, but they are not.

15:02.230 --> 15:04.150
They have become extremely,

15:04.230 --> 15:08.110
extremely hardworking,

15:08.750 --> 15:10.430
active,

15:10.510 --> 15:12.790
and also dedicated.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.590
How they have achieved it?

15:17.150 --> 15:21.870
Only by knowing that this dedication brings forth

15:22.550 --> 15:25.230
all the cleansing, and all the powers.

15:25.310 --> 15:28.430
Now, supposing this instrument is not clean.

15:28.550 --> 15:31.550
You won't be able to even hear Me,

15:31.630 --> 15:33.430
it is useless.

15:34.150 --> 15:38.990
So our instrument has to be perfect

15:40.110 --> 15:44.030
to manifest Sahaja Yoga.

15:44.110 --> 15:48.550
If it is not, all the defects can have double effects;

15:48.630 --> 15:52.230
like, first it will affect you,

15:52.830 --> 15:58.350
you can never feel the full advantage of Sahaja Yoga,

15:58.470 --> 16:01.750
and secondly it will affect the people who will meet you,

16:01.830 --> 16:03.510
and gradually they'll find out

16:03.590 --> 16:06.310
there's something wrong with you.

16:07.110 --> 16:10.070
"Some sort of a subdued madness",

16:10.150 --> 16:12.510
they'll say, "this Sahaja Yoga is,

16:12.590 --> 16:16.030
because I don't find anything great about this man.

16:16.190 --> 16:19.270
He's halfway here and halfway there."

16:22.710 --> 16:26.870
Once you start getting deeper into your being,

16:26.950 --> 16:30.470
you'll be amazed that you can develop

16:30.550 --> 16:32.910
such capacities

16:34.150 --> 16:39.030
that you will be amazed at yourself.

16:41.150 --> 16:44.390
Of course, there are blessings, there are miracles,

16:44.470 --> 16:47.710
but think of your own capacities.

16:52.550 --> 16:55.430
What are your capacities?

16:56.550 --> 17:00.310
How far are you able to do

17:00.470 --> 17:04.350
something about curing people?

17:06.550 --> 17:08.870
We have few people in Bombay,

17:08.950 --> 17:11.550
and very few people in Pune also.

17:12.030 --> 17:15.030
But they are available for curing.

17:15.390 --> 17:19.950
Some of them are going to villages.

17:20.110 --> 17:24.510
Now they have asked Me to give them a jeep,

17:24.790 --> 17:28.230
so they could take a music party to the villages

17:28.390 --> 17:30.870
and sing there,

17:33.030 --> 17:35.350
and achieve

17:36.510 --> 17:39.590
a greater number of Sahaja Yogis.

17:39.750 --> 17:42.790
But when they come back, immediately,

17:42.870 --> 17:45.670
whether they come in the daytime or in the night,

17:45.750 --> 17:48.150
immediately they wash their feet

17:48.230 --> 17:50.230
before the photograph.

17:51.830 --> 17:54.310
Also to protect yourself,

17:54.390 --> 17:57.030
you have to give yourself a bandhan,

17:57.110 --> 17:58.030
all the time.

17:58.110 --> 18:00.150
It is not you should say: "Now, I'm all right."

18:00.230 --> 18:02.230
You should not say that: "I am perfect."

18:02.310 --> 18:04.230
You should not say: "Now I'm a Sahaja Yogi."

18:04.310 --> 18:06.030
Never, never think like that.

18:06.110 --> 18:08.230
The moment you start thinking you are perfect,

18:08.310 --> 18:10.230
you are finished.

18:12.710 --> 18:16.510
So before going out, you must give a proper bandhan.

18:16.910 --> 18:19.910
Also before sleeping you must give a proper bandhan.

18:20.190 --> 18:24.110
Put your attention to your Sahasrara and then sleep.

18:26.950 --> 18:30.070
It's very amazing how things work out.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.230
Immediately you will know a person

18:33.310 --> 18:37.030
is meditating or not, immediately.

18:37.790 --> 18:40.270
It's like he is a person who

18:40.430 --> 18:43.430
has given a bath to the child.

18:46.470 --> 18:49.150
Though he has given a bath to the child,

18:49.230 --> 18:50.590
still he has not taken a bath.

18:50.670 --> 18:53.310
You can make it out, the difference between the two.

18:55.110 --> 18:58.150
In the same way, those who have been meditating

18:58.230 --> 19:00.470
every day, morning and evening,

19:00.550 --> 19:02.070
not much time needed.

19:02.150 --> 19:03.630
You see, we waste all our time

19:03.710 --> 19:05.390
in something nonsensical.

19:08.710 --> 19:14.710
When there is complete understanding of yourself,

19:14.910 --> 19:18.790
and complete understanding of these vibrations,

19:20.310 --> 19:25.990
then only you can handle them properly.

19:26.190 --> 19:28.870
All this knowledge is for you.

19:29.510 --> 19:32.030
Is absolutely free as you know,

19:32.110 --> 19:35.310
and all this mastery can be yours.

19:35.390 --> 19:37.150
So do not just get satisfied:

19:37.230 --> 19:40.710
"All right, today's Sunday, we'll go to the church,

19:42.390 --> 19:46.030
take the hymn book, let us sing this hymn number

19:46.110 --> 19:49.110
such-and-such, again sit down, get up, sit down."

19:50.950 --> 19:53.910
Come back home just the same.

19:55.670 --> 20:01.390
So today I have really thought of telling all of you

20:01.470 --> 20:05.790
that you have to develop the depth within yourself.

20:09.030 --> 20:12.590
And if you cannot develop that depth,

20:12.670 --> 20:16.070
then you are still a mediocre.

20:17.950 --> 20:23.510
Actually all these great secrets about the Goddess

20:23.590 --> 20:27.790
or Her powers, were not told to anyone like that.

20:28.110 --> 20:29.390
Never.

20:30.470 --> 20:36.390
Only when they had completed their oneness

20:37.750 --> 20:42.670
- I would say the full idea, full understanding

20:43.110 --> 20:46.030
between the oneness of God

20:46.110 --> 20:49.150
and your relationship with that,

20:50.110 --> 20:52.470
absolutely –

20:53.590 --> 20:57.710
nobody would do anything before that.

21:00.030 --> 21:03.670
Now the days are, of Sahaja Yoga, are so simple

21:03.830 --> 21:06.150
that as soon as you get Realization,

21:06.230 --> 21:09.110
you can start giving Realization to others.

21:09.550 --> 21:11.270
Immediately.

21:11.830 --> 21:13.230
Just under your hand you will see

21:13.310 --> 21:14.870
the Kundalini will move.

21:14.950 --> 21:16.430
You put your hand on somebody's head,

21:16.510 --> 21:19.390
and you'll find that person gets realization.

21:21.990 --> 21:23.430
It's a fact.

21:23.510 --> 21:25.830
It just works that way.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.870
But that means, for many:

21:28.950 --> 21:30.830
"Oh, there's nothing to be done.

21:30.910 --> 21:32.270
After all, is all done by Mother,

21:32.350 --> 21:34.670
we have just achieved something."

21:37.110 --> 21:40.310
You can always understand that

21:40.390 --> 21:44.030
Mother can only work out a very good instrument,

21:45.150 --> 21:47.630
and not a weak instrument.

21:47.910 --> 21:54.870
So now, we have some very great Sahaja Yogis

21:55.150 --> 21:57.990
who have gone very deep into it.

21:58.110 --> 22:00.990
Invariably, whenever I asked,

22:01.070 --> 22:03.150
they say: "Mother, every day we worship.

22:03.230 --> 22:06.790
We worship morning and evening, every way, day.

22:06.870 --> 22:09.150
We either wash our feet

22:09.230 --> 22:11.030
and sit down before Your photograph

22:11.110 --> 22:12.950
and worship Your photograph,

22:13.030 --> 22:15.550
or else in the morning time also

22:15.630 --> 22:18.230
we do something like that."

22:18.310 --> 22:22.590
And amazingly, you can make them out immediately.

22:24.350 --> 22:28.310
There may be six hundred people at the airport,

22:30.830 --> 22:32.750
but immediately I know

22:32.830 --> 22:36.190
who has been meditating every day.

22:41.070 --> 22:44.470
Now, it is for us.

22:44.550 --> 22:47.550
We have been doing Sahaja Yoga for the last,

22:47.630 --> 22:50.070
now, more than twenty years,

22:50.550 --> 22:53.070
and now we are entering into twenty-first year,

22:53.150 --> 22:56.150
we can say; but I'm ready, you see, it is like that,

22:56.230 --> 23:01.110
because now it was 1970, and now it is 1990,

23:01.630 --> 23:05.670
so it is all this thing, plus ninety-one.

23:08.910 --> 23:11.030
So much time we have had.

23:11.110 --> 23:12.270
Of course, I would say,

23:12.350 --> 23:15.190
you didn't get your Realization at that time;

23:15.270 --> 23:19.390
but whatever time you got the Realization,

23:20.910 --> 23:24.230
I did not judge how far you were in it.

23:24.310 --> 23:27.150
I said: "First let them have their Realization."

23:27.230 --> 23:29.790
They got their Realization.

23:30.110 --> 23:32.870
So once they got their Realization, you see,

23:33.310 --> 23:36.790
people who have really

23:39.390 --> 23:42.230
felt the responsibility,

23:42.310 --> 23:44.470
from the very first day they got to it,

23:44.550 --> 23:45.790
from the very first day.

23:45.870 --> 23:48.310
I didn't have to tell them.

23:48.390 --> 23:52.550
I'm not talking about Indians, I'm talking about others.

23:54.550 --> 23:56.750
And they have done, they have shown

23:56.830 --> 23:59.870
tremendous improvement, tremendous.

24:01.550 --> 24:04.230
We have been sending you Indian boys from there,

24:04.310 --> 24:06.030
Indian girls from there,

24:06.110 --> 24:08.750
just for you to know that

24:08.830 --> 24:12.990
they can also help you in Sahaja Yoga.

24:13.630 --> 24:15.790
Definitely can help you.

24:15.870 --> 24:18.670
You have to have a proper type of a person,

24:18.950 --> 24:22.790
and you'll be amazed at the way they are,

24:22.870 --> 24:25.990
that they can impart everything,

24:26.310 --> 24:30.910
and they are least bothered about their ego.

24:31.030 --> 24:32.870
There's no ego at all.

24:36.670 --> 24:41.030
So you are not achieving all this for your ego.

24:41.110 --> 24:43.910
You are achieving it because

24:45.630 --> 24:47.990
you are a seeker,

24:48.070 --> 24:50.710
and now you have become a Sahaja Yogi.

24:50.950 --> 24:53.510
So it is to be understood that it's not

24:53.590 --> 24:56.950
something like a advantage in money wise,

24:57.030 --> 24:59.030
or something that I have to have a power,

24:59.110 --> 25:00.150
this, that;

25:00.230 --> 25:02.230
because if you do not meditate,

25:02.310 --> 25:05.070
your attention will go to such things.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.510
Immediately you'll start thinking:

25:07.590 --> 25:09.910
Can I become the leader?

25:09.990 --> 25:14.150
All right, if not: "Should I debase the leader?

25:14.230 --> 25:16.150
How can I insult him?

25:16.230 --> 25:19.510
How can I fight for that? How can I do that?

25:19.590 --> 25:21.630
How can I work it out this way?"

25:21.710 --> 25:23.630
You try to insult also.

25:23.710 --> 25:27.510
If not possible, you might use violence sometimes,

25:27.590 --> 25:29.430
anger,

25:31.110 --> 25:33.870
because you are not yet, I should say,

25:33.950 --> 25:35.950
that much evolve, evolved,

25:36.030 --> 25:39.030
so much mature, so much wiser.

25:39.110 --> 25:41.310
So now, what you have to do

25:41.390 --> 25:44.310
is to... at the very

25:44.390 --> 25:47.030
first shot when you get up in the morning,

25:47.110 --> 25:49.150
you first say that: "Let me see,

25:49.230 --> 25:52.190
what is my responsibility as a Sahaja Yogi?"

25:55.110 --> 25:58.230
After some time you will start enjoying it,

25:58.310 --> 26:02.470
because it will give you such tremendous powers,

26:02.550 --> 26:05.790
such tremendous experience.

26:07.630 --> 26:12.830
Now then, you just sit down with very humble mind,

26:12.910 --> 26:16.150
and first of all say: "Mother, if I have any ego, please take away.

26:16.230 --> 26:18.030
Mother, if I have any conditioning,

26:18.110 --> 26:19.230
please take away; because

26:19.310 --> 26:20.790
I'm a seeker out and out,

26:20.870 --> 26:22.150
I don't want all these things."

26:22.230 --> 26:24.070
But if you do not meditate,

26:24.150 --> 26:28.070
then this Mr. Ego will secretly crawl upon you,

26:28.150 --> 26:30.230
and you may try to become the leader,

26:30.310 --> 26:32.870
or some sort of an assertion you'll do,

26:32.950 --> 26:38.510
some sort of a stupid ego actions,

26:38.590 --> 26:40.870
which we have many in Sahaja Yoga.

26:40.950 --> 26:42.470
If you write them down,

26:42.550 --> 26:46.270
you will not know how to stop laughing.

26:48.750 --> 26:53.190
So to warn yourself, I would say that

26:53.270 --> 26:57.310
the only way to protect yourself is to do

26:57.390 --> 26:59.790
the meditation in the morning and evening,

26:59.870 --> 27:04.270
and also to keep yourself in complete bandhan.

27:09.870 --> 27:13.990
Yours is a very important role

27:14.070 --> 27:17.590
and a very important time,

27:17.670 --> 27:20.950
extremely important.

27:21.030 --> 27:23.270
You have no idea,

27:23.350 --> 27:27.270
that in the history of spirituality

27:27.350 --> 27:32.110
no one could do so much as you can do.

27:33.750 --> 27:37.790
So, if you really

27:39.710 --> 27:42.950
do the Antarmana,

27:43.030 --> 27:46.670
if you really see inside yourself,

27:46.750 --> 27:50.830
while meditating you see yourself, your chakras and all that,

27:50.910 --> 27:53.870
and then you find out this introspection:

27:53.950 --> 27:55.830
Why am I like this?

27:55.910 --> 27:58.190
Just separate from yourself, see for yourself:

27:58.310 --> 28:01.950
"Why am I like this? Why I did like this?

28:02.030 --> 28:06.110
Why do I think like this? Who am I?"

28:08.310 --> 28:11.070
These questions when answered,

28:11.150 --> 28:15.070
you will know all your worth, your value.

28:20.710 --> 28:24.390
I do not know how much I should stress,

28:24.470 --> 28:27.150
how much more is needed to stress

28:27.230 --> 28:31.350
the importance of meditation, every day.

28:32.670 --> 28:34.070
Like these advertisements you see,

28:34.110 --> 28:37.150
every day they just go on bombarding

28:37.230 --> 28:39.230
on your head, and:

28:39.310 --> 28:43.910
Buy this, buy that, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy.

28:44.150 --> 28:45.950
It acts.

28:47.230 --> 28:50.030
In the same way, you have to every day

28:50.110 --> 28:52.310
bombard yourself: "Now, meditation.

28:52.390 --> 28:55.030
Get to meditation. Get to meditation."

28:55.110 --> 28:57.990
Then you'll be surprised

28:58.110 --> 29:01.350
that when you'll go out, you'll see something beautiful;

29:01.430 --> 29:03.990
immediately you'll get into thoughtless awareness.

29:04.070 --> 29:06.230
Don't have to do.

29:06.790 --> 29:10.110
As soon as you'll meet a Sahaja Yogi, immediately into thoughtless;

29:10.190 --> 29:13.430
the other person, you both will go.

29:14.310 --> 29:18.310
Everything you start enjoying in a very different manner.

29:18.470 --> 29:21.230
And such beautiful feelings come in,

29:21.310 --> 29:25.630
such beautiful security is built up

29:27.990 --> 29:30.710
that you are surprised:

29:30.790 --> 29:33.070
"How I could be like that?

29:33.110 --> 29:37.510
How I could feel these securities just expressing

29:37.590 --> 29:41.110
themselves in such a beautiful manner?"

29:41.630 --> 29:47.470
Because if you are, say, washed and clean

29:47.550 --> 29:49.790
- simple thing, everyday life –

29:51.150 --> 29:54.070
then before touching any, everything you are careful

29:54.150 --> 29:56.950
that you don't again spoil them.

29:58.070 --> 30:02.630
If there's a sari, which is dirty, absolutely dirty,

30:02.710 --> 30:06.070
then if there are two spots or hundred spots,

30:06.150 --> 30:07.870
makes no difference.

30:08.390 --> 30:10.310
But when it is absolutely clean, then

30:10.390 --> 30:13.470
even the slightest spot you can get worried,

30:13.550 --> 30:15.910
because everybody will see that.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.110
In the same way,

30:20.190 --> 30:22.750
unless and until you cleanse yourself every day,

30:22.830 --> 30:25.790
you will not know what's wrong with you.

30:30.230 --> 30:34.990
I hope you'll pay full attention to what I've said here today,

30:35.070 --> 30:38.150
with full attention

30:39.670 --> 30:43.590
on your inner being

30:44.270 --> 30:46.710
projecting out,

30:48.430 --> 30:51.150
like a witness to yourself.

30:52.350 --> 30:55.150
Just see how you talk to others:

30:55.470 --> 30:57.550
"Why should I talk like that?

30:57.630 --> 31:00.150
What is the need to talk?"

31:00.630 --> 31:02.910
And then you'll start understanding

31:02.990 --> 31:04.830
that behind all this

31:04.910 --> 31:09.110
is some sort of a funny thing going on in my brain,

31:13.590 --> 31:16.670
and this brain has to be corrected

31:16.750 --> 31:18.550
- Very important.

31:18.790 --> 31:25.230
Now, at the end of the day we should find out:

31:25.310 --> 31:29.390
What good things I have done for Sahaja Yoga?

31:32.310 --> 31:37.190
Also, we can find out, "How I have been

31:37.270 --> 31:41.350
not up to the point in Sahaja Yoga?"

31:45.030 --> 31:47.710
If it could be done,

31:50.110 --> 31:53.870
you find out: "How far I have gone

31:55.310 --> 32:00.030
with these powers to spread Sahaja Yoga?

32:00.550 --> 32:03.590
How far I can go?"

32:03.710 --> 32:06.390
It's really remarkable because,

32:06.470 --> 32:11.710
as I told you, in Austria we have some boys

32:12.030 --> 32:16.030
who are all the time researching about Sahaja Yoga.

32:17.230 --> 32:20.030
They have read the book of Adi Shankaracharya,

32:20.110 --> 32:22.910
which I have not yet read.

32:23.910 --> 32:25.830
They have read all kinds of things,

32:25.950 --> 32:28.910
just to find out how far they are,

32:28.990 --> 32:30.510
and as a result

32:30.590 --> 32:34.670
they themselves went on developing

32:34.790 --> 32:38.590
very, very deep into their beings;

32:38.750 --> 32:41.710
but the way, you see,

32:41.790 --> 32:46.310
you go on developing deep, deep, deep, deep, deep,

32:46.390 --> 32:49.950
and you'll be amazed the deeper you go,

32:50.030 --> 32:53.790
you won't show off, you won't show off.

32:53.870 --> 32:56.030
You'll just emit.

32:56.110 --> 32:59.990
Like, one gentleman once came to My house

33:01.870 --> 33:06.230
and they said, "Mother, some cooler has come inside.

33:06.390 --> 33:09.990
It looks some cooler has come inside. Ya, ya, there's a cooler coming."

33:10.070 --> 33:13.710
He didn't say anything, didn't do anything.

33:14.390 --> 33:16.070
Just walking inside the house:

33:16.150 --> 33:19.070
Some cooler has come.

33:20.310 --> 33:22.150
You just felt, you know;

33:22.230 --> 33:24.870
like in the forest if you go,

33:24.950 --> 33:29.590
and you find complete silence, even the birds are not twittering,

33:29.670 --> 33:32.310
then know there's a tiger sitting there.

33:32.390 --> 33:36.830
Tiger doesn't do anything; it's just sleeping maybe, poor thing.

33:36.910 --> 33:40.550
But the whole place is awed by his presence, you see.

33:40.670 --> 33:44.470
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi, anywhere, will stand out.

33:44.550 --> 33:46.230
Look at these saints, they didn't know

33:46.310 --> 33:48.230
how to raise even the Kundalini,

33:48.310 --> 33:51.190
but they were very pure people.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.070
They never raised anybody's Kundalini.

33:54.150 --> 33:56.030
They never gave Realization to anyone.

33:56.110 --> 33:58.030
They were extremely pure people.

33:58.110 --> 34:01.550
There was no impurity left in them.

34:01.630 --> 34:04.910
And so, how much they could produce:

34:04.990 --> 34:07.910
what poetry, what work,

34:07.990 --> 34:13.150
what spiritual, spiritual ideas,

34:13.230 --> 34:16.830
what sayings; I mean, tremendous –

34:16.910 --> 34:20.670
such depth in whatever they did,

34:20.950 --> 34:23.270
such effectiveness.

34:23.430 --> 34:26.230
Now, we are here to gain our spirituality,

34:26.310 --> 34:28.070
not to gain money,

34:28.110 --> 34:32.590
not to gain positions,

34:32.670 --> 34:36.750
powers - nothing. We are here to gain our spirituality,

34:36.830 --> 34:40.870
and in that spirituality, it's all there.

34:44.310 --> 34:46.870
All the satisfaction,

34:47.470 --> 34:49.110
everything is there.

34:49.230 --> 34:52.670
It will have an effect on the children.

34:55.070 --> 34:59.070
It will have an effect on the surroundings,

34:59.150 --> 35:03.390
in every way, and the personality.

35:06.310 --> 35:09.670
So it's not a question also individuals doing that,

35:09.750 --> 35:13.230
but collectively doing it.

35:15.270 --> 35:18.710
The collective should look a beautiful thing.

35:18.790 --> 35:22.710
So you should have, I would say, in an ashram,

35:22.830 --> 35:25.790
a collective meditation.

35:27.630 --> 35:30.230
In Austria they do it early in the morning,

35:30.310 --> 35:33.430
four o'clock, collectively.

35:33.790 --> 35:35.230
So they know how many are there,

35:35.310 --> 35:37.950
and how many are missing, this, that.

35:38.030 --> 35:41.030
But I said: "Don't point out. Let's see."

35:41.110 --> 35:43.510
When those who have been doing meditation like that

35:43.590 --> 35:47.030
rise so high, others start following them.

35:48.510 --> 35:51.550
So don't think about others: what time he got up.

35:51.630 --> 35:53.870
It's I; I have to look after myself.

35:53.950 --> 35:58.270
It's very selfish: Swarth.

35:58.350 --> 36:00.710
You have to know the meaning of Swa

36:00.790 --> 36:02.430
- that is selfishness –

36:02.510 --> 36:06.030
and when you know that meaning, then you are not bothered

36:06.110 --> 36:10.030
whatsoever anybody might say, whatsoever anyone may try to do.

36:10.110 --> 36:12.070
Supposing your husband is funny:

36:12.150 --> 36:14.670
Oh, doesn't matter. He'll come round.

36:14.750 --> 36:18.230
Supposing your wife is funny: Doesn't matter, she'll come round.

36:18.310 --> 36:22.150
Is nothing important. To you, this is the most important thing to do,

36:22.230 --> 36:24.230
and all those who have thought like this

36:24.310 --> 36:26.270
and have acted like this,

36:26.350 --> 36:29.190
were above everything.

36:29.310 --> 36:32.390
Nothing can put them down.

36:32.550 --> 36:35.550
So, today is the first day of Brisbane.

36:35.630 --> 36:39.310
I bless you all, that you should have

36:39.390 --> 36:42.630
this full idea about yourself,

36:42.750 --> 36:44.750
why you are on this earth,

36:44.830 --> 36:48.310
and what great work you are supposed to do.

36:48.390 --> 36:50.550
Each one of you is capable.

36:50.630 --> 36:52.550
Each one of you can do it,

36:52.630 --> 36:54.830
but you... I would request you

36:54.910 --> 36:58.950
that you imbibe these qualities within you,

36:59.030 --> 37:00.550
which are already there.

37:00.630 --> 37:03.550
I mean, I wouldn't say "imbibe", but you manifest them,

37:03.630 --> 37:05.710
and once you start manifesting,

37:05.790 --> 37:08.790
see your temperament how it is.

37:08.910 --> 37:11.710
We'll look after your children; don't worry.

37:11.790 --> 37:13.790
May God bless you.
