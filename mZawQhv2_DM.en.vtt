00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:09.190
This is the first time we are having a puja in Brisbane,

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.150
and I'm happy so many have come here

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.470
from various places.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.070
You know that by puja you,

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.070
you excite the Chakras within Me

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.230
and you get lots of vibrations,

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.310
and you achieve,

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.950
suddenly, a height in your awareness.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.110
You do achieve that, but

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.990
after some time they say that:

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.550
Mother, again we come down.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.630
Also, they were saying that:

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.830
"When we go to India we are all right,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.910
and when we come back, again we come down."

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.150
Luckily, now we have an Ashram,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.830
which is a very good thing.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.030
To have an ashram itself is a, I must say,

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.750
is a very, very

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.150
positive thing because

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.950
that is how Ganesha is established here.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.070
So Ashram is here for a collective living,

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.950
but a collective living of spirituality.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.790
It's not just living here, but it is of spirituality.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.790
And we have to know certain things about

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.230
the discipline that we have to keep,

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.750
which is very important.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.070
It's not just a house where are, some people

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.590
have gathered together to live together,

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.630
but it has to have a discipline.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.230
Then only you'll be helped

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.750
because if you do not come

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.230
to the Ashram with this idea

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.390
that you are going there to ascend yourself,

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.030
it will make no difference

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.150
whether you stay in the house

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.230
or you go in the Ashram.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.110
So there are two types of meditation,

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.830
two types,

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.830
where one is the meditation where -

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.030
we can call it the antarmana -

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.630
that we meditate inside ourselves,

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.390
to see for ourselves what's wrong with us,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.030
and how we have to correct,

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.710
what we have to do about it.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.270
And another is bahir mana,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.710
which is outside,

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.030
how we have to live outside.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.390
You have to have a discipline,

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.110
which is not imposed on you

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.710
but, very happily,

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.670
which you have

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.990
accepted

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.670
and have imbibed.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.870
For any art, say in India, I don't know here, but

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:26.990
you have to put yourself into a rigorous training

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.070
to achieve any height.

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.510
You cannot haphazardly move about it.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.030
You cannot take just easily everything.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.070
In Sahaja Yoga there is no tapascharya,

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.710
there is no penance for you.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.510
It's all blessings.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.190
But one should not get lost with those blessings,

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.590
if you have to really get into yourself

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.190
in its full depth.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.150
So, for the antarmana it is important

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.110
that you all should meditate,

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.670
morning and evening, every day.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.830
Is all right even if you do not brush your teeth,

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.070
but you must meditate is an important thing.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.030
That is the reason I find that in the West

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.030
people go on catching,

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.070
again cleaning, again catching.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.750
Every time I come... [I] find somebody is suffering

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.230
from either... for some sort of a conditioning,

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.670
or say, some sort of a baddha,

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.190
or sometimes it's ego or something.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.150
It comes and goes.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:48.590
It is not something that is detached permanently.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.310
As we have to take our bath every day,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.350
we have to wash ourselves every day,

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.070
in the same way we have to wash ourselves within.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.110
So meditation is the antarmana

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.590
tapaha, as you can call it.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.830
But it's not such a Tapaha even.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.030
You don't have to go to Himalayas and sit there.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.670
You have to just do this meditation

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.350
early in the morning.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.350
In the Sahaja Yoga system,

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.830
I would say the best that is working out

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.110
is in Germany and in Austria, these two;

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.910
and also England, but not to that extent.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.350
I would say these two are working out the best;

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.910
and thirdly, in Rome.

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.070
They too have ashrams of the same kind,

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.150
but for them it is very important to achieve

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.550
the heights of Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.870
Absolutely. Nothing is more important.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.070
Invariably, in all these ashrams

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.910
I've seen people get up at four o'clock.

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.310
I also get up every day at four.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.150
Then I may sleep later on,

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:09.470
but at four o'clock I am up.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.590
They take their baths,

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.310
get ready for the pujas,

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.230
and then sit down and do about

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.950
five, ten minutes puja of the photograph,

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.790
and then meditate.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.430
Then they go and have some breakfast or something.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.870
Then when they come home from work,

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.430
also they sit down together to meditate,

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.910
that's the collective part of it,

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.150
or discuss whatever is to be done, what,

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.910
how are we to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.710
They just talk about Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.270
or they decide what should be done,

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.110
what is the best way

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.110
to solve the problems of Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.230
And then in the night, before sleeping,

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.230
invariably all of them,  all of them,

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.910
one and all, even children before sleeping,

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:14.470
soak their feet in the water,

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.110
sit for meditation, and sleep.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.430
That's why I find Austria has come up so well,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:25.870
and Germans.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.110
You know, Germans are like that.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.830
If something gets into their heads,

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.030
for them that's the most important thing;

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:36.070
then they do not sort of fickle out.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:37.150
There's no...

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.110
they don't have any compromises on those points.

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.830
And they make their body work hard.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.830
Now, what is the Tapa in this thing here

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.670
- the penance?

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.110
That our body is used to some sort of a life.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.150
India also, we are all like that in India

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.390
- everybody will get up in the morning,

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.350
and they will sit for puja,

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.030
or they will sit for meditation.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.310
I mean, that goes without saying,

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.470
you don't have to tell them.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.990
Because that's the traditional thing to do in India:

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.390
always when they get up, have their bath,

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.830
they always do some puja,

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.950
all of them.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.030
If they're Christians, also, they'll sit down and pray.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:21.510
Muslims, they'll do Namaz.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.230
That's a kind of a practice,

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.790
and the breeding of the family.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.550
Here I find that the parents

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.230
do not take the responsibility

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:35.630
to pass on any information to children

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.710
about disciplining themselves,

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:40.350
because children are also extremely aggressive.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.310
They don't want to know about it.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:49.030
So the parents also dare not tell them

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.270
that: "It is good for you, please do it this way;

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.910
it is better that you meditate."

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.870
They're afraid that they may lose their children

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.430
if they tell them like this.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.150
Or, "You pray", or "You get up at this time".

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.150
You dare not tell them that you get up at this time.

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.870
This is the greatest crime in the West

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:10.030
if you tell them that:

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.790
"You have to get up at four o'clock" - amah!

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.710
It's like the worst punishment.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.630
But once you start getting up in the morning,

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:25.070
you'll get the habit, and then you'll sleep early.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.030
Then you can sleep early.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:34.030
Getting up in the morning, really,

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.350
will help you for the whole day.

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:39.910
So start this kind of a practice.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.910
You must meditate every day,

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.910
and this is the reason why I find people,

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.510
whenever I come, they're again caught up,

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:49.590
something gone wrong.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.190
This is wrong, that is wrong;

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:54.630
they're caught up here and there. Why should you?

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.710
Day by day, you must rise.

00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:01.630
Day by day, you should be at a much higher state,

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:06.070
and this new breeding has to come within us,

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:08.230
that we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.550
And we are not here only,

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:17.910
just to have good food and to have a nice time

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:21.830
or nice meetings, but we are here

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:27.990
to become those unique personalities,

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:31.910
which are required to raise the humanity

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.110
to a higher state.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:39.070
So you have to be, now, responsible for yourself.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.510
You have to look after yourself

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.550
and you have to tell yourself:

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.870
"Mr. So-and-so, Mrs. So-and-so,

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:48.950
please now behave yourself."

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.990
Otherwise, Sahaja Yoga is lost to you.

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.710
It's not going to help you much.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:02.150
We might increase in quantity,

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:04.950
but quality-wise we'll be missing;

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.150
and one attack of negativity can finish

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.310
such a quantity that we think is too much

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.670
- it has happened once.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.950
So now, all of you must develop

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:25.390
that dedication to yourself,

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:31.150
to find out what's your problem,

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.870
and how you have to correct it.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:40.030
If it is done every day, I can assure you,

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.230
you will have no problem of any kind.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.310
Your thoughts will stop,

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.510
your problems will be solved,

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.150
and you'll have no catches at all,

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.070
because you have washed them off.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.390
But if you leave them on your being,

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:03.070
then they grow, and they become big.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.110
So there should be no lethargy,

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.870
as far as meditation is concerned,

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:13.750
but joyfully you'll start doing, after some time.

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:16.950
You won't be happy if you have not done it.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:19.510
But in the beginning you'll have to goad yourself,

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:21.350
and tell yourself

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:26.830
that this body has to be cleaned;

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:29.470
but more than that body,

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.750
this mind and intellect, both of them,

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.350
are to be corrected.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:38.910
To be an instrument of God,

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.030
you have to be perfect,

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.310
perfect personality,

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:46.070
otherwise we may not be able to communicate

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.870
the message of Sahaja Yoga in the proper way.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:53.030
Many people say that:

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.830
"We are surrendered to Mother,

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.070
and we are surrendered to Her,

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.230
and as surrendering we'll get everything."

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.990
But what are you surrendering?

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.430
Is that a clean heart,

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:12.070
or a heart full of all kinds of wrong things?

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.470
Or is that the intelligence,

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:22.270
which is a very superior type of clean intelligence?

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:26.110
Or else, are you coming out

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.990
with all your arrogance?

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:37.070
So though there is the Ganges of Sahaja Yoga flowing,

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:43.230
still you have to have the depth of a pitcher.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:47.110
A stone cannot fetch any water.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.310
Same with children.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.470
Of course, as they'll be going to India,

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:56.190
I am sure they'll form proper routines,

00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:01.070
and they'll form proper meditation methods.

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:07.790
It is obvious that we have never had

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:11.830
the sense of Divinity in the West.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.470
Whatever we had, whatever we got

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.150
from the church or from any

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.270
synagogue or something like that,

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.110
which was only Sunday to Sunday, Sunday to Sunday;

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.350
for a Muslim it is Friday to Friday, Friday to Friday,

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.150
finished.

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:33.070
But that has led them nowhere.

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:36.310
So we have to do something about it.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.430
Problems will be solved in no time.

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:43.350
You don't have to sit down and contemplate

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.390
and worry: how will you solve your problem?

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.390
It will be solved.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.230
But what cannot be solved

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.390
is the habits you have developed,

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.710
habits of lethargy.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.990
I can understand in London

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.750
if the people are lethargic, but they are not.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.150
They have become extremely,

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:08.110
extremely hardworking,

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:10.430
active,

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.790
and also dedicated.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.590
How they have achieved it?

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:21.870
Only by knowing that this dedication brings forth

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.230
all the cleansing, and all the powers.

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:28.430
Now, supposing this instrument is not clean.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:31.550
You won't be able to even hear Me,

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:33.430
it is useless.

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:38.990
So our instrument has to be perfect

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:44.030
to manifest Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:48.550
If it is not, all the defects can have double effects;

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.230
like, first it will affect you,

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:58.350
you can never feel the full advantage of Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:01.750
and secondly it will affect the people who will meet you,

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.510
and gradually they'll find out

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:06.310
there's something wrong with you.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:10.070
"Some sort of a subdued madness",

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:12.510
they'll say, "this Sahaja Yoga is,

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:16.030
because I don't find anything great about this man.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:19.270
He's halfway here and halfway there."

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:26.870
Once you start getting deeper into your being,

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:30.470
you'll be amazed that you can develop

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.910
such capacities

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:39.030
that you will be amazed at yourself.

00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:44.390
Of course, there are blessings, there are miracles,

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.710
but think of your own capacities.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:55.430
What are your capacities?

00:16:56.550 --> 00:17:00.310
How far are you able to do

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:04.350
something about curing people?

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.870
We have few people in Bombay,

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:11.550
and very few people in Pune also.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:15.030
But they are available for curing.

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:19.950
Some of them are going to villages.

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:24.510
Now they have asked Me to give them a jeep,

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.230
so they could take a music party to the villages

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.870
and sing there,

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.350
and achieve

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.590
a greater number of Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.790
But when they come back, immediately,

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:45.670
whether they come in the daytime or in the night,

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.150
immediately they wash their feet

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:50.230
before the photograph.

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:54.310
Also to protect yourself,

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.030
you have to give yourself a bandhan,

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.030
all the time.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.150
It is not you should say: "Now, I'm all right."

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.230
You should not say that: "I am perfect."

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.230
You should not say: "Now I'm a Sahaja Yogi."

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:06.030
Never, never think like that.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:08.230
The moment you start thinking you are perfect,

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.230
you are finished.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:16.510
So before going out, you must give a proper bandhan.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:19.910
Also before sleeping you must give a proper bandhan.

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:24.110
Put your attention to your Sahasrara and then sleep.

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.070
It's very amazing how things work out.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.230
Immediately you will know a person

00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:37.030
is meditating or not, immediately.

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:40.270
It's like he is a person who

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:43.430
has given a bath to the child.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.150
Though he has given a bath to the child,

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.590
still he has not taken a bath.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.310
You can make it out, the difference between the two.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.150
In the same way, those who have been meditating

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:00.470
every day, morning and evening,

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:02.070
not much time needed.

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.630
You see, we waste all our time

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.390
in something nonsensical.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:14.710
When there is complete understanding of yourself,

00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:18.790
and complete understanding of these vibrations,

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:25.990
then only you can handle them properly.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.870
All this knowledge is for you.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.030
Is absolutely free as you know,

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.310
and all this mastery can be yours.

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:37.150
So do not just get satisfied:

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.710
"All right, today's Sunday, we'll go to the church,

00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:46.030
take the hymn book, let us sing this hymn number

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.110
such-and-such, again sit down, get up, sit down."

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:53.910
Come back home just the same.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:20:01.390
So today I have really thought of telling all of you

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:05.790
that you have to develop the depth within yourself.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:12.590
And if you cannot develop that depth,

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:16.070
then you are still a mediocre.

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:23.510
Actually all these great secrets about the Goddess

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:27.790
or Her powers, were not told to anyone like that.

00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:29.390
Never.

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:36.390
Only when they had completed their oneness

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:42.670
- I would say the full idea, full understanding

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:46.030
between the oneness of God

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:49.150
and your relationship with that,

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.470
absolutely –

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:57.710
nobody would do anything before that.

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:03.670
Now the days are, of Sahaja Yoga, are so simple

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.150
that as soon as you get Realization,

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:09.110
you can start giving Realization to others.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.270
Immediately.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.230
Just under your hand you will see

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:14.870
the Kundalini will move.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:16.430
You put your hand on somebody's head,

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:19.390
and you'll find that person gets realization.

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:23.430
It's a fact.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.830
It just works that way.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:28.870
But that means, for many:

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:30.830
"Oh, there's nothing to be done.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.270
After all, is all done by Mother,

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.670
we have just achieved something."

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:40.310
You can always understand that

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:44.030
Mother can only work out a very good instrument,

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.630
and not a weak instrument.

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:54.870
So now, we have some very great Sahaja Yogis

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:57.990
who have gone very deep into it.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.990
Invariably, whenever I asked,

00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:03.150
they say: "Mother, every day we worship.

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.790
We worship morning and evening, every way, day.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.150
We either wash our feet

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.030
and sit down before Your photograph

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.950
and worship Your photograph,

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.550
or else in the morning time also

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:18.230
we do something like that."

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:22.590
And amazingly, you can make them out immediately.

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:28.310
There may be six hundred people at the airport,

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.750
but immediately I know

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:36.190
who has been meditating every day.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:44.470
Now, it is for us.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:47.550
We have been doing Sahaja Yoga for the last,

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.070
now, more than twenty years,

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:53.070
and now we are entering into twenty-first year,

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:56.150
we can say; but I'm ready, you see, it is like that,

00:22:56.230 --> 00:23:01.110
because now it was 1970, and now it is 1990,

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:05.670
so it is all this thing, plus ninety-one.

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.030
So much time we have had.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.270
Of course, I would say,

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:15.190
you didn't get your Realization at that time;

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:19.390
but whatever time you got the Realization,

00:23:20.910 --> 00:23:24.230
I did not judge how far you were in it.

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:27.150
I said: "First let them have their Realization."

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.790
They got their Realization.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:32.870
So once they got their Realization, you see,

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.790
people who have really

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:42.230
felt the responsibility,

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.470
from the very first day they got to it,

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:45.790
from the very first day.

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:48.310
I didn't have to tell them.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:52.550
I'm not talking about Indians, I'm talking about others.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.750
And they have done, they have shown

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:59.870
tremendous improvement, tremendous.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:04.230
We have been sending you Indian boys from there,

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.030
Indian girls from there,

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:08.750
just for you to know that

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:12.990
they can also help you in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.790
Definitely can help you.

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.670
You have to have a proper type of a person,

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:22.790
and you'll be amazed at the way they are,

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:25.990
that they can impart everything,

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:30.910
and they are least bothered about their ego.

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.870
There's no ego at all.

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:41.030
So you are not achieving all this for your ego.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.910
You are achieving it because

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:47.990
you are a seeker,

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.710
and now you have become a Sahaja Yogi.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:53.510
So it is to be understood that it's not

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.950
something like a advantage in money wise,

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:59.030
or something that I have to have a power,

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.150
this, that;

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.230
because if you do not meditate,

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:05.070
your attention will go to such things.

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.510
Immediately you'll start thinking:

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.910
Can I become the leader?

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:14.150
All right, if not: "Should I debase the leader?

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.150
How can I insult him?

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:19.510
How can I fight for that? How can I do that?

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:21.630
How can I work it out this way?"

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:23.630
You try to insult also.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.510
If not possible, you might use violence sometimes,

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:29.430
anger,

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:33.870
because you are not yet, I should say,

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:35.950
that much evolve, evolved,

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:39.030
so much mature, so much wiser.

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:41.310
So now, what you have to do

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.310
is to... at the very

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:47.030
first shot when you get up in the morning,

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.150
you first say that: "Let me see,

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.190
what is my responsibility as a Sahaja Yogi?"

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:58.230
After some time you will start enjoying it,

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:02.470
because it will give you such tremendous powers,

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:05.790
such tremendous experience.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:12.830
Now then, you just sit down with very humble mind,

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:16.150
and first of all say: "Mother, if I have any ego, please take away.

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:18.030
Mother, if I have any conditioning,

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.230
please take away; because

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:20.790
I'm a seeker out and out,

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:22.150
I don't want all these things."

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:24.070
But if you do not meditate,

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:28.070
then this Mr. Ego will secretly crawl upon you,

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:30.230
and you may try to become the leader,

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:32.870
or some sort of an assertion you'll do,

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:38.510
some sort of a stupid ego actions,

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.870
which we have many in Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:42.470
If you write them down,

00:26:42.550 --> 00:26:46.270
you will not know how to stop laughing.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:53.190
So to warn yourself, I would say that

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:57.310
the only way to protect yourself is to do

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:59.790
the meditation in the morning and evening,

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:04.270
and also to keep yourself in complete bandhan.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.990
Yours is a very important role

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:17.590
and a very important time,

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.950
extremely important.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:23.270
You have no idea,

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:27.270
that in the history of spirituality

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:32.110
no one could do so much as you can do.

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:37.790
So, if you really

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.950
do the Antarmana,

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:46.670
if you really see inside yourself,

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:50.830
while meditating you see yourself, your chakras and all that,

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:53.870
and then you find out this introspection:

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:55.830
Why am I like this?

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:58.190
Just separate from yourself, see for yourself:

00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:01.950
"Why am I like this? Why I did like this?

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:06.110
Why do I think like this? Who am I?"

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:11.070
These questions when answered,

00:28:11.150 --> 00:28:15.070
you will know all your worth, your value.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:24.390
I do not know how much I should stress,

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:27.150
how much more is needed to stress

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:31.350
the importance of meditation, every day.

00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.070
Like these advertisements you see,

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.150
every day they just go on bombarding

00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.230
on your head, and:

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:43.910
Buy this, buy that, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:45.950
It acts.

00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:50.030
In the same way, you have to every day

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:52.310
bombard yourself: "Now, meditation.

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:55.030
Get to meditation. Get to meditation."

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:57.990
Then you'll be surprised

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:01.350
that when you'll go out, you'll see something beautiful;

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:03.990
immediately you'll get into thoughtless awareness.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:06.230
Don't have to do.

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:10.110
As soon as you'll meet a Sahaja Yogi, immediately into thoughtless;

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:13.430
the other person, you both will go.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:18.310
Everything you start enjoying in a very different manner.

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:21.230
And such beautiful feelings come in,

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:25.630
such beautiful security is built up

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:30.710
that you are surprised:

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:33.070
"How I could be like that?

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:37.510
How I could feel these securities just expressing

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:41.110
themselves in such a beautiful manner?"

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:47.470
Because if you are, say, washed and clean

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:49.790
- simple thing, everyday life –

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:54.070
then before touching any, everything you are careful

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:56.950
that you don't again spoil them.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:02.630
If there's a sari, which is dirty, absolutely dirty,

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:06.070
then if there are two spots or hundred spots,

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:07.870
makes no difference.

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.310
But when it is absolutely clean, then

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:13.470
even the slightest spot you can get worried,

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:15.910
because everybody will see that.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.110
In the same way,

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:22.750
unless and until you cleanse yourself every day,

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:25.790
you will not know what's wrong with you.

00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:34.990
I hope you'll pay full attention to what I've said here today,

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:38.150
with full attention

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:43.590
on your inner being

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:46.710
projecting out,

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.150
like a witness to yourself.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:55.150
Just see how you talk to others:

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:57.550
"Why should I talk like that?

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.150
What is the need to talk?"

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:02.910
And then you'll start understanding

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:04.830
that behind all this

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:09.110
is some sort of a funny thing going on in my brain,

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:16.670
and this brain has to be corrected

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.550
- Very important.

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:25.230
Now, at the end of the day we should find out:

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:29.390
What good things I have done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:37.190
Also, we can find out, "How I have been

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:41.350
not up to the point in Sahaja Yoga?"

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.710
If it could be done,

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:53.870
you find out: "How far I have gone

00:31:55.310 --> 00:32:00.030
with these powers to spread Sahaja Yoga?

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:03.590
How far I can go?"

00:32:03.710 --> 00:32:06.390
It's really remarkable because,

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:11.710
as I told you, in Austria we have some boys

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:16.030
who are all the time researching about Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:20.030
They have read the book of Adi Shankaracharya,

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.910
which I have not yet read.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:25.830
They have read all kinds of things,

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:28.910
just to find out how far they are,

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:30.510
and as a result

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:34.670
they themselves went on developing

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:38.590
very, very deep into their beings;

00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:41.710
but the way, you see,

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:46.310
you go on developing deep, deep, deep, deep, deep,

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:49.950
and you'll be amazed the deeper you go,

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:53.790
you won't show off, you won't show off.

00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:56.030
You'll just emit.

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:59.990
Like, one gentleman once came to My house

00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:06.230
and they said, "Mother, some cooler has come inside.

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:09.990
It looks some cooler has come inside. Ya, ya, there's a cooler coming."

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:13.710
He didn't say anything, didn't do anything.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:16.070
Just walking inside the house:

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:19.070
Some cooler has come.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:22.150
You just felt, you know;

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:24.870
like in the forest if you go,

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:29.590
and you find complete silence, even the birds are not twittering,

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:32.310
then know there's a tiger sitting there.

00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:36.830
Tiger doesn't do anything; it's just sleeping maybe, poor thing.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:40.550
But the whole place is awed by his presence, you see.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:44.470
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi, anywhere, will stand out.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:46.230
Look at these saints, they didn't know

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:48.230
how to raise even the Kundalini,

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:51.190
but they were very pure people.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.070
They never raised anybody's Kundalini.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:56.030
They never gave Realization to anyone.

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:58.030
They were extremely pure people.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:01.550
There was no impurity left in them.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:04.910
And so, how much they could produce:

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:07.910
what poetry, what work,

00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:13.150
what spiritual, spiritual ideas,

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:16.830
what sayings; I mean, tremendous –

00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:20.670
such depth in whatever they did,

00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:23.270
such effectiveness.

00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:26.230
Now, we are here to gain our spirituality,

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:28.070
not to gain money,

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:32.590
not to gain positions,

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:36.750
powers - nothing. We are here to gain our spirituality,

00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:40.870
and in that spirituality, it's all there.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:46.870
All the satisfaction,

00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:49.110
everything is there.

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:52.670
It will have an effect on the children.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:59.070
It will have an effect on the surroundings,

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:03.390
in every way, and the personality.

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:09.670
So it's not a question also individuals doing that,

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:13.230
but collectively doing it.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:18.710
The collective should look a beautiful thing.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:22.710
So you should have, I would say, in an ashram,

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:25.790
a collective meditation.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:30.230
In Austria they do it early in the morning,

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:33.430
four o'clock, collectively.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:35.230
So they know how many are there,

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:37.950
and how many are missing, this, that.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:41.030
But I said: "Don't point out. Let's see."

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:43.510
When those who have been doing meditation like that

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:47.030
rise so high, others start following them.

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:51.550
So don't think about others: what time he got up.

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:53.870
It's I; I have to look after myself.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:58.270
It's very selfish: Swarth.

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.710
You have to know the meaning of Swa

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:02.430
- that is selfishness –

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:06.030
and when you know that meaning, then you are not bothered

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:10.030
whatsoever anybody might say, whatsoever anyone may try to do.

00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:12.070
Supposing your husband is funny:

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:14.670
Oh, doesn't matter. He'll come round.

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:18.230
Supposing your wife is funny: Doesn't matter, she'll come round.

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:22.150
Is nothing important. To you, this is the most important thing to do,

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.230
and all those who have thought like this

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.270
and have acted like this,

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.190
were above everything.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.390
Nothing can put them down.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:35.550
So, today is the first day of Brisbane.

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:39.310
I bless you all, that you should have

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:42.630
this full idea about yourself,

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:44.750
why you are on this earth,

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:48.310
and what great work you are supposed to do.

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:50.550
Each one of you is capable.

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:52.550
Each one of you can do it,

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:54.830
but you... I would request you

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:58.950
that you imbibe these qualities within you,

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:00.550
which are already there.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:03.550
I mean, I wouldn't say "imbibe", but you manifest them,

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:05.710
and once you start manifesting,

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:08.790
see your temperament how it is.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:11.710
We'll look after your children; don't worry.

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:13.790
May God bless you.
