00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.640
Mahashivaratri Puja, Pune (India), 15 February 2004.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.280
(Translated from Hindi)

00:01:43.024 --> 00:01:52.304
Today we are here to do the Guru's puja

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:05.810
The Guru is praised more than the Deities and the Gods

00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:14.176
Who is this Guru?

00:02:15.523 --> 00:02:23.061
In this, which is the most important shakti?

00:02:29.427 --> 00:02:36.296
The Guru tattwa is the Shiva.

00:02:36.873 --> 00:02:55.073
The form of the Shiva's power we should consider as the Guru's power.

00:02:55.983 --> 00:03:03.674
Because when we take the powers from the Guru's shakti,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:12.492
and when the shaktis come within us then we ourselves become the Guru

00:03:13.186 --> 00:03:21.589
And with this, we are blessed for the whole life (Kalyan).

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:26.532
The one who gets these powers,

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:32.096
it seems he has got all the blessings (kalyan).

00:03:32.331 --> 00:03:38.567
"Kalyan" is a word which is very hard to explain in a few words.

00:03:39.537 --> 00:03:47.482
"Kalyan" means to get blessed from all the sides.

00:03:47.683 --> 00:03:52.256
the obtain joy from all the sides.

00:03:54.215 --> 00:03:58.215
When someone says that in the blessings you have got the Kalyan,

00:03:58.416 --> 00:04:00.896
what does it mean?

00:04:01.096 --> 00:04:03.533
What is Kalyan?

00:04:03.734 --> 00:04:12.734
Kalyan means Atma Sakshatkar, the Self-Realisation.

00:04:13.946 --> 00:04:19.336
Without the Self-Realisation, you cannot have the Kalyan.

00:04:19.537 --> 00:04:26.988
Nobody can understand without having it.

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:32.503
All these things are in the Kalyan.

00:04:32.704 --> 00:04:42.554
Because of this a person gets all the joy, and he becomes radiant.

00:04:43.435 --> 00:04:52.546
To have this Kalyan, whatever you have to do you have done it all,

00:04:52.747 --> 00:04:56.327
whatever efforts you have to make it has all been made,

00:04:56.528 --> 00:05:00.098
the faith which you have to take, you have already taken it.

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:03.744
But when you are all in the "Kalyanmarg" (Path of Kalyan),

00:05:03.945 --> 00:05:06.590
when he has given the mantra to have the Kalyan,

00:05:06.791 --> 00:05:09.294
what does it mean?

00:05:09.495 --> 00:05:14.775
It means that the most important thing

00:05:14.976 --> 00:05:18.720
inside you is samadhan (satisfaction).

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.169
Afterwards you all don't have to search for anything,

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.691
you have all become the Gurus.

00:05:27.892 --> 00:05:32.915
You don't have to take some great things in this moment,

00:05:33.116 --> 00:05:35.735
but the blessings of this samadhana

00:05:35.936 --> 00:05:38.722
you all can feel inside yourselves,

00:05:38.923 --> 00:05:41.552
you all can know inside yourselves

00:05:41.753 --> 00:05:47.536
you all can enjoy within yourselves.

00:05:47.737 --> 00:05:52.699
First of all you all can see that the physical diseases,

00:05:52.900 --> 00:06:03.770
the physical problems can be removed by this Kalyanmarg,

00:06:03.971 --> 00:06:08.442
all the problems which are coming within you

00:06:08.643 --> 00:06:14.736
that prevent you from blossoming,

00:06:16.226 --> 00:06:26.932
can be removed by this Kalyanmarg.

00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:40.106
When you all take to this, you get the Kalyan

00:06:40.307 --> 00:06:50.135
and you have the Self-Realisation.

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:57.323
In this Shri Mahadeva is helping you.

00:06:57.524 --> 00:07:03.349
When the kundalini opens the sahasrara,

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.507
Shri Mahadeva is sitting over there.

00:07:07.708 --> 00:07:10.934
And because of this, we call Him Mahadeva.

00:07:11.135 --> 00:07:15.135
It means the God of all the Gods, Mahadeva.

00:07:15.336 --> 00:07:21.049
in this Kalyan there are many important aspects.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:26.510
The first thing is shanti (peace).

00:07:26.711 --> 00:07:38.218
Mental peace, physical peace and the peace in the family life.

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:43.579
In the family life there are many problems, many obstacles,

00:07:44.736 --> 00:07:50.676
and all these can be solved by the Kalyanmarg.

00:07:50.877 --> 00:08:00.975
Afterwards we cannot even feel the presence of the obstacles.

00:08:01.176 --> 00:08:03.894
In this way we could see many people in the whole world

00:08:04.095 --> 00:08:11.325
getting blessings from this Kalyanmarg and meditating upon it

00:08:11.526 --> 00:08:15.326
and enjoying for the whole life.

00:08:17.584 --> 00:08:20.461
This is the Kalyan by which mankind

00:08:20.662 --> 00:08:24.095
can get the balances within themselves.

00:08:24.296 --> 00:08:28.158
And to obtain this balance,

00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:32.215
you have to go under the protection of the Guru.

00:08:32.416 --> 00:08:40.581
When you become the devotee of a Guru,

00:08:40.782 --> 00:08:46.196
you get the balance and you get everything.

00:08:46.397 --> 00:08:49.036
After this you do not need anything.

00:08:49.236 --> 00:08:54.605
In this way we get the balance

00:08:54.806 --> 00:08:59.988
and we obtain the power of love within ourselves.

00:09:00.189 --> 00:09:09.044
When mankind obtains this, this whole body rejoices.

00:09:09.245 --> 00:09:16.732
When you obtain this state,

00:09:16.933 --> 00:09:25.013
the shaktis (powers) destroy all the problems,

00:09:25.229 --> 00:09:35.949
the disturbances in the body and the physical state,

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:46.207
and so many people try very hard to obtain this shakti.

00:09:46.408 --> 00:09:52.269
He can get the shakti only form a person that is self-realised.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:10:00.093
and then he himself becomes in the God's form.

00:10:00.294 --> 00:10:01.927
Talk in English

00:10:02.128 --> 00:10:11.489
This is a subject which you can only explain in Hindi language,

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:20.453
which says that this Guru Padh you get from somebody else.

00:10:20.654 --> 00:10:26.734
But that somebody else is itself, is endowed with, the power

00:10:26.935 --> 00:10:32.339
the power of peace of mind, to begin with,

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:45.785
and also the power to overcome all kinds of of earthly problems,

00:10:45.986 --> 00:10:50.618
mental problems, physical problems.

00:10:50.819 --> 00:10:55.797
All these problems you can solve through your mental balance

00:10:55.998 --> 00:11:03.044
and mental blessings from your Guru.

00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:05.085
When you become the Guru,

00:11:05.286 --> 00:11:11.037
you yourself have the power, to bless others.

00:11:11.246 --> 00:11:21.240
With your blessing power you can create a guru out of many.

00:11:21.782 --> 00:11:31.084
And once the Guru is created and there is a Guru,

00:11:31.285 --> 00:11:36.977
who has this power, it's very satisfying and is very [UNCLEAR: enabling?].

00:11:37.178 --> 00:11:44.418
The satisfaction is so much that you don't want anything.

00:11:44.619 --> 00:11:47.862
This is the power of Shiva.

00:11:48.063 --> 00:11:52.143
You have seen Shiva, doesn't have much clothes,

00:11:52.344 --> 00:11:54.784
He doesn't decorate Himself,

00:11:54.985 --> 00:11:59.210
He is just sitting in meditative mood, all the time.

00:11:59.411 --> 00:12:01.528
He doesn't want anything.

00:12:01.636 --> 00:12:07.115
He's so satisfied with Himself that He doesn't want anything.

00:12:07.316 --> 00:12:13.382
And that is the power you get after the Self-realization,

00:12:13.583 --> 00:12:20.587
if you have a Guru, and Guru of that level and caliber.

00:12:20.788 --> 00:12:23.739
One should not try to become a Guru.

00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:27.573
That's very, impractical.

00:12:27.774 --> 00:12:30.461
If you try to become, you'll never.

00:12:30.596 --> 00:12:33.806
It has to come to you automatically,

00:12:34.007 --> 00:12:38.540
without any asking, without any effort.

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:43.757
So the only way you can get to it is through Dhyana.

00:12:43.958 --> 00:12:46.268
Dhyana is meditation.

00:12:46.326 --> 00:12:48.716
When you meditate,

00:12:48.779 --> 00:12:55.720
just meditate, and meditate, do not ask for anything.

00:12:55.921 --> 00:12:58.716
Meditation itself gives you

00:12:58.917 --> 00:13:07.550
that instrument which can bear this great power of the Guru.

00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:12.636
And then you automatically, you give this power to others;

00:13:12.933 --> 00:13:15.360
you don't have to work it out.

00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:17.685
Just in your presence,

00:13:17.807 --> 00:13:20.494
people can get this power .

00:13:20.596 --> 00:13:24.631
of complete satisfaction

00:13:24.832 --> 00:13:31.556
And there is salvation, for you and for others.

00:13:31.716 --> 00:13:38.546
So all the problems which are faced

00:13:38.601 --> 00:13:41.600
for the journey of ascent are finished

00:13:41.801 --> 00:13:50.559
and you [are or now] drenched in the bliss of heavenly

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.525
peace and joy.

00:13:55.726 --> 00:13:58.665
That's why it is called as Kaivalya,

00:13:58.866 --> 00:14:03.517
means only, only the blessings.

00:14:03.718 --> 00:14:07.366
See that means there is no other word to translate it.

00:14:07.567 --> 00:14:10.763
There's no other way of explaining it.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:15.022
It's a state. It's a Stithi.

00:14:15.087 --> 00:14:17.461
It's a state, in that state you have to rise

00:14:17.662 --> 00:14:20.351
and you know that you are in that state.

00:14:20.552 --> 00:14:23.115
It's a very remarkable thing,

00:14:23.316 --> 00:14:28.529
that once you reach that state you don't have to ask for anything.

00:14:28.599 --> 00:14:32.453
It's all there, and you are so satisfied.

00:14:32.654 --> 00:14:37.157
I can go on talking about this special power

00:14:37.362 --> 00:14:42.703
but I think whatever I have said please meditate on that.

00:14:42.904 --> 00:14:46.670
And you are all capable of reaching that state.

00:14:46.871 --> 00:14:50.237
That state of complete peace and joy.

00:14:50.438 --> 00:14:53.617
May God bless you.
