1
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:40,701
I am sorry, I had to speak in Marathi
language

2
00:45:40,726 --> 00:45:47,201
because I had to tell them something
which I don't want you to know.

3
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:01,884
Today is a great day, I should say
in a way,

4
00:46:02,368 --> 00:46:09,277
because I am going to tell you
one thing great.

5
00:46:09,302 --> 00:46:17,015
That is Shri Gyaneshwara - in Marathi
they call it 'Dnyaneshwara' -

6
00:46:18,384 --> 00:46:25,514
He was the incarnation of Kartikeya.

7
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:40,261
And Saraswati, who was a virgin,
she looked after Him like Her own son.

8
00:46:40,286 --> 00:46:48,103
He was the brother of Shri Ganapati
but She looked after Him.

9
00:46:48,128 --> 00:46:52,331
And then also there’s description how
He was born and all those (things),

10
00:46:52,356 --> 00:46:55,499
 is very interesting.

11
00:46:55,524 --> 00:47:05,783
But here in this place, in this Maharashtra,
He took His incarnation.

12
00:47:05,808 --> 00:47:11,563
And also there were many great, great,
very great saints

13
00:47:11,588 --> 00:47:20,936
in so many numbers took place,
took their birth in this Maharashtra.

14
00:47:22,274 --> 00:47:29,484
But such horrible people, they tortured
their lives.

15
00:47:29,509 --> 00:47:32,495
Worse than Christian Inquisition I tell you;

16
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,758
worse than any inquisition anywhere.

17
00:47:36,783 --> 00:47:40,285
Individually they attacked.

18
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:45,811
And that same people are born again

19
00:47:47,353 --> 00:47:52,971
in this great country of Maharashtra.

20
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:56,476
They are very talented people; they write
very well.

21
00:47:56,501 --> 00:48:00,846
Their language is so rich.

22
00:48:00,871 --> 00:48:07,835
You can see that, what description

23
00:48:09,397 --> 00:48:20,364
of a realized soul, given by Gyaneshwara,
is so beautiful.

24
00:48:21,663 --> 00:48:29,187
He says that, "The moon doesn’t run
after moonlight,

25
00:48:29,212 --> 00:48:34,481
the sun doesn’t run after sunlight.

26
00:48:34,506 --> 00:48:43,164
In that way a realized soul doesn’t bother
about his own glory.

27
00:48:45,987 --> 00:48:52,784
The sun shines till it shines, then it
takes back all his rays.

28
00:48:52,809 --> 00:48:59,843
Whatever work the rays have to do
they do it. And the sun is just watching,

29
00:49:00,111 --> 00:49:03,883
watching all the work, then he takes
them back.

30
00:49:03,908 --> 00:49:11,566
And he gets completely contained within
himself”.

31
00:49:11,591 --> 00:49:18,217
Samavun ghene, completely contained
within himself.

32
00:49:18,242 --> 00:49:24,209
The description He has given of realized
souls

33
00:49:24,234 --> 00:49:30,746
is so beautiful, if you could just
experience it.

34
00:49:30,771 --> 00:49:35,259
Namadeva, who was born much later,
said that

35
00:49:35,284 --> 00:49:44,715
even one line of Gyanesha [Gyaneshwara]
if you could experience,

36
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,309
you had that.

37
00:49:47,334 --> 00:49:51,458
I wish you all could read Amrutanubhava
in English,

38
00:49:51,483 --> 00:49:57,484
understanding how He describes
a realized soul,

39
00:49:57,509 --> 00:50:01,638
and you'll find that within yourself
it has happened.

40
00:50:01,683 --> 00:50:05,255
You are different from others very much.

41
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:15,397
You'll be amazed how you have got
such beautiful description of your Self.

42
00:50:15,422 --> 00:50:22,473
I was talking about Maharashtrians;
they are extremely talented people.

43
00:50:22,498 --> 00:50:28,710
See their music. In music no-one can
beat them.

44
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:33,894
See their drama. In drama no-one can
beat them.

45
00:50:34,771 --> 00:50:39,839
You can see from films. In Maharashtra
only

46
00:50:39,864 --> 00:50:43,634
great films were created.

47
00:50:43,659 --> 00:50:50,049
The another one is Bengal, which is,

48
00:50:50,074 --> 00:50:56,420
I would say, different but of the same
level.

49
00:50:56,445 --> 00:51:00,918
It's such a talented people here,

50
00:51:00,943 --> 00:51:06,647
it shows that God has a special blessing
for these two,

51
00:51:06,672 --> 00:51:12,704
and, should be, Maharashtrians should rise
very high.

52
00:51:12,729 --> 00:51:18,022
But all the time complaining about others,
talking ill of others,

53
00:51:18,047 --> 00:51:21,662
and something very low they do.
I'm surprised that,

54
00:51:21,697 --> 00:51:28,062
I hope you don't pick up anything from them.

55
00:51:28,087 --> 00:51:36,665
And also the fussiness that is of the North
Indians;

56
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:40,529
that's also not a very good thing.

57
00:51:40,554 --> 00:51:46,593
It's surprising how you people have adjusted
yourself to this country,

58
00:51:46,618 --> 00:51:51,459
which has all kinds of parasites.

59
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:58,936
Because you live with vibrations, you feel
the vibrations.

60
00:51:58,961 --> 00:52:03,584
It's something so great to see you all here,

61
00:52:03,609 --> 00:52:10,632
and I'm telling them that they should try
to understand you people.

62
00:52:10,657 --> 00:52:17,193
Really I’m very proud of you all who have
come all the way here.

63
00:52:17,218 --> 00:52:27,099
In this puja I am thinking of so many great
saints who were born,

64
00:52:27,124 --> 00:52:33,848
who were great gurus, mahagurus. Of course
Gyanesha,

65
00:52:33,873 --> 00:52:44,459
I must say, is the king of all those high,
highly evolved souls, no doubt.

66
00:52:44,484 --> 00:52:52,428
So we are now having a puja on the twenty
-fourth of December

67
00:52:52,462 --> 00:52:58,003
because it's a Datta Jayanti, Dattatreya's
birth.

68
00:52:58,028 --> 00:53:01,793
And so we'll be having on the twenty-fourth
night.

69
00:53:01,818 --> 00:53:07,899
In any case it's a Christmas Eve. We could
all start with that.

70
00:53:07,924 --> 00:53:14,274
And also Dattatreya, who took His form
in Maharashtra.

71
00:53:14,299 --> 00:53:18,881
Maharashtrians understand Dattatreya.

72
00:53:18,906 --> 00:53:24,645
They understand the Nath Panthis.
These Nathas went all over.

73
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:33,650
They went to Kiev. You'll be amazed,
they went even up to Bolivia,

74
00:53:33,675 --> 00:53:42,068
those who are from Maharashtra, from Rahuri.
Can you imagine?

75
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:46,508
Such great people they were,

76
00:53:46,533 --> 00:53:52,021
and that is what I expect to happen
in this Maharashtra.

77
00:53:52,046 --> 00:53:59,882
And I'm sure one day I'll be very much
happy with all of them; not few.

78
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:03,951
There are some very great Maharashtrians,
no doubt,

79
00:54:03,977 --> 00:54:10,926
but all of them have to join together
because I talk of synthesis,

80
00:54:10,951 --> 00:54:14,195
not of divisive method.

81
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:20,494
I hope they understand the inner feeling
that I have,

82
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:29,718
otherwise all the good diamonds will be
selected

83
00:54:29,743 --> 00:54:34,986
and the ones which are defective will be
thrown away.

84
00:54:36,479 --> 00:54:43,468
What's the use? But all of them are capable
of achieving any height.

85
00:54:43,493 --> 00:54:47,027
They may belong to any caste, community,
doesn't matter;

86
00:54:47,052 --> 00:54:51,055
but they are born in Maharashtra,

87
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:55,415
which is such a great country.

88
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,610
So today they wanted to do Mahalakshmi,

89
00:54:58,635 --> 00:55:02,425
this thing, we already have Mahalakshmi
temple.

90
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:07,494
And they have a great blessing of Mahalakshmi
also, in a way,

91
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:13,022
but they lack: one is the wisdom,

92
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:18,882
and the second the spirit of Kartikeya.

93
00:55:19,729 --> 00:55:27,563
The spirit of Kartikeya - that

94
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:38,396
pure, absolute dynamism

95
00:55:39,195 --> 00:55:46,750
which doesn't indulge into nonsensical things
and useless things;

96
00:55:46,775 --> 00:55:52,804
which shows results.
May God bless you all!
