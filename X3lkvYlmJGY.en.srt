1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:18,720
Is very difficult to speak, even for Me

2
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:34,200
to see so many Sahaja yogis

3
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:44,600
sitting here with such shining faces

4
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,120
from all over the world,

5
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:57,760
as if My vision has taken its form today.

6
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:13,480
I see in you the saviors of tomorrow

7
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,640
who are going to save this world

8
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,880
from all the Kali Yuga calamities

9
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,480
that are surrounding us.

10
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,200
Is coming from all sides,

11
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:39,600
while you people have really taken your second birth

12
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,080
from this pond of Kali Yuga

13
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,760
and have really become beautiful lotuses of different colors,

14
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,560
hues, fragrance and beauty.

15
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,760
Instead of you celebrating My birthday,

16
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,800
is better I celebrate your birthdays.

17
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,600
As I told you the other day that

18
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:22,440
it is you who are such great seekers, seekers of truth, of love,

19
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,240
that it could work out,

20
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,880
otherwise it would have been impossible.

21
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,360
To even transform one person is very difficult,

22
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,880
but you were so sensitive

23
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:45,240
and so deep that this subtle knowledge,

24
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:51,000
I don’t know how it penetrated your being.

25
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,560
It’s unbelievable.

26
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,440
I can’t believe Myself

27
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:05,480
what great people have taken birth in this Kali Yuga.

28
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,600
No one can believe that there are so many

29
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,120
saints are sitting before Me, so many Walis;

30
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,840
so many Nalis are sitting before Me.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,440
In the history of spirituality it has never happened.

32
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,400
Even in the heavens there are few devatas

33
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,720
and devas, not so many.

34
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,680
One better than the other

35
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:43,160
such beautiful heart,

36
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,160
such brilliant brains

37
00:03:49,480 --> 00:04:02,000
and such active attention, is really

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,720
I thank you all that this seventieth birthday I could see

39
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,320
so many people, which I never expected.

40
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,160
You know, Sahaja Yoga was started with one person

41
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,320
and then those who came also,

42
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,160
out of them, some were power-oriented, money-oriented,

43
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,560
all kinds of people created problems for us.

44
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,120
One after another, so many problems came

45
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,440
and also there were many who were

46
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,000
of a very low-level seekers.

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,360
But I find today they have all come up beautifully.

48
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,280
I cannot distinguish one from another,

49
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,000
the way it has happened.

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,480
And the commitment you have to Sahaja Yoga

51
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,720
is the greatest blessings for this world.

52
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,360
I could not do it alone. You know that.

53
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,600
If I could do it, I would not have needed you.

54
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,560
You are the channels

55
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,120
and you have to work it out further and further.

56
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,560
It is really remarkable the way

57
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,880
Delhi people have organized everything.

58
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,520
First of all, everybody was very much

59
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,360
keyed onto the seventieth birthday.

60
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,680
I don’t know what was the reason, but whatever it is,

61
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,040
and then Delhi people said,

62
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,040
“This time we are going to celebrate,

63
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,000
Mother, Your birthday in Delhi.”

64
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,120
I said, “Everybody's … on it, so be careful,

65
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,160
it's not going to be easy. It’s a big headache.

66
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,480
So many will be coming down.”

67
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,080
But they didn’t expect so much, I’m sure

68
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,280
… people are coming. Hundred are coming from there,

69
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,480
hundred from there. I said, “Are you worried?”

70
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,800
They said, “No we are very happy about it.”

71
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,320
I saw their enthusiasm, their organization,

72
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,000
the way they have done it.

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,920
The best part of it,

74
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,280
Delhi, which is a place where all kinds of politicians live,

75
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,480
have groups and politics and all that,

76
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,760
but in Sahaja Yoga in Delhi there is no politics.

77
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,600
There is no quarrelling.

78
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,520
There is no pulling each other’s legs.

79
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,360
Is very remarkable thing

80
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,480
it to happen in a place like Delhi,

81
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,600
where every day what you hear

82
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,920
that even in our parliament they are beating each other.

83
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,760
Perhaps, in this hell only,

84
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,640
this goodness was to be born and

85
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,720
to be manifested by Sahaja yogis.

86
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,440
The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

87
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,560
as you know, is extremely, extremely subtle

88
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,200
and it’s not easy

89
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,720
to penetrate into the so-called

90
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,200
people who call themselves intellectuals

91
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:15,320
or who are absolutely bowed down to their conditionings.

92
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,400
So, on one side, we have the masses who are ignorant,

93
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,200
another side the classes who live in the frame

94
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,840
that they have made out of their brains.

95
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,840
Both ways, I think, they are extremely gross.

96
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,240
But the way they have absorbed

97
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:50,440
this subtle nectar of Divinity is something unbelievable.

98
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,200
Nobody can comprehend even

99
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:09,840
that there were so many born after My birth,

100
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,320
on this Earth,

101
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,280
or some maybe before also, very few.

102
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,080
Just after My birth they were born here

103
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,440
in this world, to get to Sahaja Yoga.

104
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,840
But when I saw the world I was shocked,

105
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,400
more shocked than Kabira, himself.

106
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,200
I said, “How will I talk to anyone about it?”

107
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,360
My family members,

108
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,840
I didn't know how will I open the subject to them.

109
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:57,080
Was impossible, so much was darkness of ignorance.

110
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,680
How will they believe that there is really Divinity,

111
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,800
there is totality waiting for them?

112
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,920
They all believed into some sort of a religion,

113
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,240
which had no connection with reality.

114
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,160
And it was impossible even to envisage

115
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,280
the method by which I could talk to them.

116
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,400
I remember the first incident

117
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:38,800
when we went to Nargol, where I had opened the Sahasrara.

118
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,120
The first person who got realization was a Gujarati and a jeweler.

119
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,920
Immediately, all the other,

120
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,440
there were hardly about thirty-five people

121
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,000
they started saying that

122
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,800
“Of course, he's a rich man, he's a jeweler,

123
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,600
so Mother has given him realization.”

124
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,640
I think that’s the first time and last time I really got angry.

125
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,560
I started shouting at them,

126
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,560
“You are good for nothing, useless people,

127
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,440
you can never take to Divinity,”

128
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,200
and I had really thought that “Stop it now.”

129
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,720
One has to take another life,

130
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,440
another time where people will understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

131
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,480
But after that, suddenly,

132
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,760
people started feeling the cool breeze in their hands,

133
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,640
immediately, after My shouting. Imagine.

134
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:43,160
And they said, “Mother, You know, it's working.

135
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,040
It's working in us. It's working out of us.”

136
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,760
Thus, we got twelve people

137
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:57,920
and one lady whom I had given before also,

138
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,080
she was the fourteenth.

139
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,960
Thus, first we had only these fourteen Sahaja yogis,

140
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:16,840
for whom it was something out of the blue.

141
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,440
They were all flabbergasted.

142
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,200
They didn't know what it was.

143
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,640
And then, surprisingly, in one of our programs,

144
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:38,160
a lady who was possessed by some Brahmin came

145
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:43,880
and started saying, “Jagadamba, Jagadamba.”

146
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,320
They couldn't understand. I never told them what I was, never.

147
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,600
I've never told otherwise also.

148
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,920
So then, she recited a poem

149
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,800
from Saundarya Lahari in Sanskrit language

150
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,200
and she was just a maidservant.

151
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,440
And in a man's voice.

152
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,440
So everybody was shocked

153
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,200
that the bhoots should say all these things.

154
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,760
And then she went away.

155
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,040
After that, these people started probing into it.

156
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,200
And they wanted to have My Puja, first time,

157
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,360
in My house itself.

158
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:36,880
Still people were not very sure they were doing the right thing.

159
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,760
Even the Brahmins they called, they said,

160
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,120
"This Saptasadi is a very difficult Puja

161
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,760
and something will happen to us."

162
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,360
But after the Puja they said,

163
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,440
“Nothing happened, we are so much better.”

164
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,920
They all felt the cool breeze

165
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,720
and the entire atmosphere changed.

166
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,920
They started understanding that

167
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,600
Sahaja Yoga is the Yuga Dharma, is the one

168
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:16,800
of this yuga, this Kali Yuga,

169
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:24,680
so the Sahaj Dharma became the dharma of this yuga.

170
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,760
This yuga is very difficult, no doubt.

171
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:38,000
But in difficulties only we become intense seekers

172
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,920
and that's what happened with all of you,

173
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,760
that you found out that everywhere

174
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,040
people were following whatever they’re following,

175
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,880
they were not reaching any point.

176
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,760
Like a cocoon,

177
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,600
they're hitting their head here and there.

178
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,880
They got their realizations

179
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,160
so quickly and when they told Me

180
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,480
how they were seeking, what was happening to them,

181
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,560
I was amazed.

182
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,920
How this seeking was working within them

183
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,880
and pushed them towards Sahaja Yoga.

184
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,080
Also, in the meanwhile, I must say,

185
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:40,720
so many got lost into the clutches of false gurus.

186
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:46,920
Despite that, today we have so many Sahaja yogis.

187
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,720
You are just representing your country,

188
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,640
but there are many more in your countries.

189
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,360
Even in India we have many more.

190
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,040
You are just here, come to represent them.

191
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,120
So, multiple of this number,

192
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,600
I do not know how many would be there.

193
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,120
So many asked "Me how many Sahaja yogis there are". I said,

194
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,000
“I don't know.”

195
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,120
Say, “You don't know?”

196
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,880
I said, “No. We have never kept any record.”

197
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,360
So they can't understand. I said,

198
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:26,520
“We have no office, no record. I have no secretary.

199
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,520
I don't know how to type.

200
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,240
I don't know how to write even My check.”

201
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,200
They can't understand

202
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,320
person like Me existing in these modern times.

203
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,440
But everything gets done, somehow.

204
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,400
Despite all My modern ignorance,

205
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,880
everything gets absolutely

206
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,600
done in the most perfect manner

207
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,720
like a remote control.

208
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,800
Now this whole thing,

209
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,440
I never said a word about it, I must tell you, nothing.

210
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:17,240
Never I gave any idea as to how it should be.

211
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,920
I didn't even tell them how many we are expecting.

212
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,080
But see how spontaneously everything has worked out

213
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,000
because you all have commitment

214
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,640
and that commitment gives you

215
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,040
all these organizing capacities.

216
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:49,120
So many things you have seen get organized

217
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,000
because also this Paramchaitanya

218
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,320
has come into Krita Yuga

219
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:01,560
where it is working it out. It’s acting.

220
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:07,200
And this activity, also, is absolutely supportive to you.

221
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,080
For example, the police people told us

222
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,360
that there are Muslims living here

223
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,040
and you might have some danger from them.

224
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,520
They might do some harm to you.

225
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,680
I said, “Which Muslims are they?”

226
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,320
So they said, “Nizamuddin Aulia’s people are here.”

227
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,200
I said, “They’ll never harm us.”

228
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,320
I said, “Why? Because he was a Sufi

229
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,080
and he was a great realized soul

230
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,360
and the people who are along there, must be, most of them are,

231
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,760
at least, believers of Sufism.

232
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,920
How can they harm us?”

233
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,080
So I said, “Tomorrow, early in the morning,

234
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:59,480
you go and put a chador, as they call it, all of you,”

235
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,880
and they were so impressed

236
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,000
that you saw in the evening they came here all the way,

237
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,680
morning time, and they were so respectful.

238
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,840
Then they called Me, they gave Me another chador,

239
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,280
this, that and they said that we are Yours and this and that,

240
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,080
all kinds of things.

241
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,120
And his disciple was Amir Khusrau,

242
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,680
was another very, very great Sufi gentleman

243
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,400
and I always have admired his poetry

244
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:33,840
and also the way Nizamuddin led his life of dignity

245
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,040
and divinity.

246
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,760
All these Muslims who were there put hands towards Me like this

247
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,840
and they said, “We are feeling the cool breeze,”

248
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,080
I said, “This is Ruh.”

249
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,840
“Ah, this is Ruh.”

250
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,840
Once these people start getting Ruh,

251
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,360
they will all become Sahaja yogis very soon

252
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,840
and you may have to have …

253
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,000
There are so many Sufis all over the world

254
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,080
and we are going to take their addresses

255
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,520
and we are going to meet them;

256
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,240
then you might have to have another big pendal,

257
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,040
double pendal I think, maybe triple.

258
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:38,200
If Delhi people are not quite frightened about the sizes,

259
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:42,640
I think again we'll have to have it in Delhi only.

260
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,800
Also contemporarily,

261
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,080
Delhi is in a state of turmoil

262
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,880
and we should be here to pacify it, to quieten it,

263
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,200
to give wisdom to those people

264
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,000
who are supposed to be at the helm of affairs.

265
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,480
It will work. Definitely, it will work.

266
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,880
With all these Sahaja yogis

267
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,240
emitting such beautiful, vibrations.

268
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,720
See, on top of your head

269
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,360
this cloth is moving up and down all the time,

270
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,320
though there is no breeze outside,

271
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,480
the leaves are just steady,

272
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,960
but from your head, you see, you are moving all this.

273
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,920
So I'm sure these vibrations

274
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,680
will cool down and will bring peace

275
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,440
to our politicians and to the people

276
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,840
who are at the helm of affairs.

277
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:06,120
At this juncture, when in the whole world

278
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,600
there are so many things going on

279
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,560
of uncertainties,

280
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,040
say in Russia, there are uncertainties,

281
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,200
Bosnia there is uncertainties,

282
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,200
in England there’s recession,

283
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,360
America there is recession,

284
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,440
Spain there is recession,

285
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,240
everybody is suffering from the pangs

286
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:36,280
of some sort of a extreme behavior they went into.

287
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,360
So, I'm sure this polarity

288
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,560
that they see now will correct

289
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,760
their behavior towards materialism

290
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,440
and I'm sure that a balance will be struck.

291
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,360
With your good wishes, with your prayers,

292
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:03,440
this world will be so beautiful,

293
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:12,400
so enchanting that in the history,

294
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,720
people will describe

295
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,360
that the world itself became a lotus

296
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:23,720
full of fragrance of Divinity.

297
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,480
You are the petals,

298
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,200
you are the corona,

299
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,200
you are the color,

300
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,760
you are the beauty,

301
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,240
you are the pollen

302
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,920
of that beautiful lotus

303
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,640
which is My vision of this world.

304
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,480
I hope today

305
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:11,000
you all will decide to work for Sahaja Yoga,

306
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,440
to spread Sahaja Yoga

307
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:16,240
and work for yourself also.

308
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,400
The only danger is

309
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,440
that one should not allow ego to sit on your heads.

310
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,480
That's the only horse.

311
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,280
If you could ride yourself and don't allow the horse to ride you,

312
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,560
you'll progress very fast,

313
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,760
beautifully.

314
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:49,800
Thus, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread.

315
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:58,360
Every birthday we have to take a vow.

316
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,800
I don't know what vow I should take.

317
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,600
People have told Me that I should not work so hard,

318
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,480
I'm working very hard,

319
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,840
but I have taken a vow that I'll work double hard.

320
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,840
In the same way, you also,

321
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,720
all of you, have to take a vow today

322
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,560
that we'll go all out in the commitment

323
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,800
of working of Sahaja Yoga.

324
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,680
We'll think about it.

325
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,520
There are scientists who should produce books,

326
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,200
there are doctors who should produce books,

327
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,680
writings,

328
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,000
go round,

329
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,920
talk to their colleagues,

330
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,880
organize meetings,

331
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,400
seminars with your colleagues.

332
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,680
There are architects

333
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,200
and other professionals

334
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:14,120
who could call their colleagues and give them realization.

335
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,840
Even the people who are dealing with finances

336
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,360
should take to Sahaja Yoga.

337
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,960
Is very important because

338
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,200
financial problems can only be

339
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,080
solved by the Divine Power.

340
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,640
Nobody else can solve it.

341
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,800
So everyone in this world,

342
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:43,240
whether it is law or any other field,

343
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,480
all of you should take to Sahaja Yoga

344
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,000
and also to creative work.

345
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,320
Then also, you have to take Sahaja Yoga

346
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,800
to your surroundings,

347
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:08,320
to villages, to cities,

348
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,360
wherever it is possible,

349
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,760
wherever you can organize,

350
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,640
you have to spread Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

351
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,360
As far as curing is concerned,

352
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,720
I would advise, you don't have to touch anyone.

353
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,520
Please use only My photograph.

354
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,360
That's how you'll get more Sahaja yogis

355
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,800
and less sick people.

356
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,320
Also, people will be cured

357
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,080
and all of them will become Sahaja yogis.

358
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,680
We have also agricultural field

359
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,120
on which we have done something,

360
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:51,520
but much can be done about agriculture.

361
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,200
One should see the government and tell them

362
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,600
what agriculture can do.

363
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,680
You can form a committee and go and see them

364
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,800
and talk to them that

365
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,720
how agriculture can be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

366
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,360
We have to help our children.

367
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,720
We have to look after them

368
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:23,920
because you know what sort of future is surrounding them,

369
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,120
what sort of atmosphere is crawling,

370
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,560
even in India.

371
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,360
So we have to see that our children

372
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,600
properly grow in Sahaj culture.

373
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
Is very important

374
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,720
because they are tomorrow's Sahaja yogis.

375
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,560
So many of them are born realized,

376
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,240
so we have to discipline them properly

377
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,880
and we have to make them aala, “aala darza”

378
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,440
Sahaja yogi, as described in the qawali.

379
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:11,880
It is also our family life which is very important.

380
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,920
Is shocking that

381
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,480
family life is nowadays becoming

382
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,400
a kind of a stupid thing.

383
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,600
No one understands the importance of it.

384
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,160
In Sahaja Yoga we have to understand.

385
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:32,880
Small quarrels, fights, should be given up.

386
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,240
Harshness must be given up, cruelty must be given up

387
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:44,120
and there should be a proper rapport

388
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:51,680
between husband and wife to begin with,

389
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:55,320
so that there is a companionship

390
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,640
and the children also see that companionship

391
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,560
and enjoy it.

392
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,160
In our dress, in our life,

393
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:12,040
we have to be dignified and decent, respecting our body.

394
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,520
Is very important.

395
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,000
We should wear whatever suits us

396
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,760
in whatever country we are.

397
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,800
I mean, imagine in summer climate

398
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:25,560
if somebody wants to wear a three-piece suit,

399
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,000
what will happen to him?

400
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,280
Whatever suits us,

401
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:34,600
whatever fits our culture,

402
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,160
one should try to wear decent dresses,

403
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,880
traditional dresses.

404
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,680
Specially for women, it is very important

405
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,520
to wear dresses that will make them look more dignified.

406
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,800
Also, another point I would like to say,

407
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:04,680
that ladies, specially, must take to reading,

408
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,200
at least newspapers.

409
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,360
If your attention is on the problems

410
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,960
that are in this world, it's very effective

411
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,800
because you know your attention is active, it works.

412
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,120
So use your attention.

413
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,600
You see the newspapers,

414
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,240
you watch – I know it's horrifying sometimes

415
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,040
you can give a bandhan,

416
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,400
but you must see what's happening where,

417
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,200
is very important.

418
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,120
Also men should not just read something sensational,

419
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,280
but read something that's happening

420
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,680
and also think, what are the solutions.

421
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,080
How can you people, as Sahaja yogis, help it,

422
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,360
in a collective way or in an individual way.

423
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:03,160
We have to solve many problems of this modern world.

424
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,240
Also one has to read good books,

425
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,280
good films one has to see,

426
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,000
and have your reflection on them.

427
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,960
Keep your mind alert.

428
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,200
There are many beautiful poems I've read recently

429
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,680
coming out of

430
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,600
some people where I never expected they will write poems,

431
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,160
beautiful, very high class.

432
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,640
So this poetry also, we are going to collect.

433
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,760
We are going to collect all the miraculous photographs

434
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,280
from everywhere.

435
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,680
They are trying to systematize now.

436
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,640
And now, in this system,

437
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,280
if you can all help spontaneously,

438
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,720
it will be a great achievement

439
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,240
because, so far, we have not been able to collect

440
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,440
all these datas and keep them with us.

441
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,480
Now the best is that you all must meditate.

442
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,200
All have to meditate.

443
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,960
Only in meditation you are in present

444
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,760
and you grow in your spirituality.

445
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,760
I've said it many a times, but people just don't do it.

446
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,320
About ten minutes, if you can meditate

447
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,920
before sleeping, it's of a very great help to you,

448
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,800
no doubt.

449
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,880
We really grow very fast.

450
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,680
Immediately I know this man is meditating,

451
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,840
the way he has changed.

452
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,640
And then, once you get used to it,

453
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,360
you'll never give it up.

454
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,320
Is very simple meditation.

455
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,080
You have foot soaking or something like that

456
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,200
and in the morning you should beat your ego,

457
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,880
that's all.

458
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,920
Is not that you have to do

459
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,360
one lakh jappas or something.

460
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,840
Nothing of the kind.

461
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,560
Is very simple.

462
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,760
But this, you have to do for yourself,

463
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:00,080
to respect your Self-realization and your growth in divinity.

464
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:09,320
We have lots of advantages over others.

465
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,600
But one thing I have to tell you,

466
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,800
those people who are not prone to seeking,

467
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,360
please don't talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

468
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,360
Don't waste your energy on such people,

469
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,360
discussing and arguing,

470
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,120
because it cannot be discussed much.

471
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,800
You just forget them and leave them alone.

472
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,400
I’ll look after them.

473
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,200
You just take to simple people, good people,

474
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,280
who are seeking the truth.

475
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,840
I don't want you to break your necks with those people

476
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,600
who are just believing in discussion,

477
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:49,960
arguments and shabda jaal.

478
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,280
Today the Sahaja Yoga culture is so much manifesting

479
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,400
that people, once they see you, they immediately know

480
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,920
there’s something special

481
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,960
and that they have something very unique

482
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,760
qualities among them which you seldom find with normal people.

483
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,320
All these things, you should understand,

484
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,440
have come to you spontaneously from within,

485
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,000
but you must preserve them and you should never feel shy of them.

486
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,480
Should never be shy of your virtues.

487
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,640
And whatever people may try

488
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,040
to tell you that “You better do this and better do that”

489
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,000
if it is wrong you should never do it.

490
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,600
Should just say, “I don't want to do it.”

491
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,840
Because, now, you are very powerful

492
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,040
and that you have to lead the people

493
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,720
and people don't have to lead you.

494
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,680
Fashions don't have to lead you,

495
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,160
but you have to create fashions.

496
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,880
You have to create a path for them.

497
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,760
It's not that you have to

498
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,720
trod on the path that they have made.

499
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,160
Try to understand

500
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,520
that your own personality

501
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:09,720
is of a level where you can see so many subtle things

502
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,360
and you are so powerful, that others don't see,

503
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,600
then you have to automatically take up their leadership.

504
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,680
Don't get ideas from them

505
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,320
and don't get frightened

506
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,800
when they try to tell you something

507
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,720
against yourself or against Sahaja Yoga.

508
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,840
Be sure. Be confident. That is how it is going to work out.

509
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,760
Now, I'm just a woman and a housewife,

510
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,160
but I was so sure about Sahaja Yoga

511
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,160
that it worked out.

512
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,520
I didn't have to,

513
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,720
sort of, think whether I should do it or not.

514
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,360
I just started it.

515
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,520
Though in the family it was not so much respected,

516
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,440
not so much agreed to, doesn’t matter.

517
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,480
I started the whole thing on My own,

518
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,320
worked it out on My own,

519
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,640
because I had complete confidence in the truth,

520
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,960
that if I am standing on the truth it will help Me

521
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,040
and it will help all those who will come to Me.

522
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,120
It has happened.

523
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:21,080
So for you, it should not be difficult at all.

524
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,880
All of you should, first of all,

525
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,200
see that you are not a conditioned person

526
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,480
and you do not have an ego

527
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,360
and then you should go ahead with it

528
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,720
and you'll be amazed how things will work out.

529
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,480
Today's puja is very short puja.

530
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,960
That's why I gave you a long lecture.

531
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,600
There are so many things which I cannot,

532
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,360
at this time, which is short, tell you

533
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,320
but if you sit down, you can easily make

534
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,440
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight yourself.

535
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,800
So, now put your mind to it

536
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,320
in a way that you are the organizer.

537
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,080
Then what should you do? What can you do?

538
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,360
What are you going to achieve?

539
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:15,000
Please try and it will work out.

540
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,480
All of you can do it.

541
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,520
I think best is to make a diary for yourself

542
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,560
and write it down in that: what you have done,

543
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,640
how many people you have given realization,

544
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,280
how many got cured, what do you think about them.

545
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,840
But now, if there’s no diary,

546
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,160
Sahaja yogis can say among,

547
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,240
“Mother, we have no diary, so we'll start it tomorrow.” No,

548
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,280
you start it today.

549
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,640
Only trouble with Sahaja yogis

550
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,560
is that they take things little lightly.

551
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,960
Of course, that is their character.

552
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,520
But not Sahaja Yoga.

553
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,800
Other things you can take lightly.

554
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,560
If somebody shouts at you,

555
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,040
somebody gets angry with you,

556
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,600
somebody even slaps you, take it lightly.

557
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,560
Doesn't matter, makes no difference to you,

558
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,520
because you are the spirit.

559
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,120
Nothing can destroy the spirit.

560
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:17,000
Nainam Chidanti Shastrani.

561
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,360
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga,

562
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,640
your attitude should be different.

563
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,840
If you are relaxing on one side,

564
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,200
another side you have to be dynamic

565
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,080
and that side is where you have to put forward

566
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,640
the theories of Sahaja Yoga,

567
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,400
when you have to talk to people,

568
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,680
you have to organize a press conference

569
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,800
or whatever sort of thing you want to do.

570
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
At whatever level you want to work it out,

571
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,240
please make a proper plan about it

572
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,360
and just do it.

573
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,720
It will all work out. I'm sure it will work out.

574
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,400
With all these ideas that I have,

575
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,520
you have many more

576
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:04,480
and I hope by next year,

577
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,200
we’ll see manifestation of those.

578
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,360
I hope many people will write books

579
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,680
like U.C. Rai has written.

580
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,600
I'm sure books can be written by every doctor.

581
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,440
Doctor U.C. Rai has worked single-handed.

582
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,160
Everything he has done single-handed.

583
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,880
So beautifully he has worked it out.

584
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:31,360
So, everybody can publish a book with their experiences,

585
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,640
with their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

586
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,600
which will help Sahaja yogis also.

587
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,720
But it should be honest, very honest book.

588
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,120
I'm sure such a book will be very much appreciated

589
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:50,720
in Sahaja Yoga and we would like to publish such books also.

590
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,920
All those who have such ideas

591
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:58,520
should make an effort to create some new books,

592
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,760
some new ideas, some new creation.

593
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,800
Is very important

594
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,840
because in these modern times

595
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:11,120
people want to do something new,

596
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,040
something novel.

597
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,840
Under these circumstances,

598
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,640
I’m sure you all will work out.

599
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,720
So, all the time we have to think about Sahaja Yoga

600
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:28,840
and jot it down whatever ideas are coming into your mind

601
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,680
and then these can be properly put together,

602
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,640
making a beautiful book of Sahaja Yoga.

603
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:39,640
Ladies also have lots of chances of doing

604
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,920
so many things for Sahaja Yoga.

605
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,560
This is a very opportune time.

606
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:59,640
I think Satya Yuga is starting from tomorrow. No doubt.

607
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,680
And what will be the symptom

608
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:26,600
that now the satya will be victorious, vijaya.

609
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,640
Whatever people may try,

610
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,560
ultimately satya will be vijaya.

611
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,040
Satyame vijayate.

612
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,960
That's going to happen and you are responsible.

613
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,800
For this I congratulate you again and again.

614
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,480
And I hope you will have the commitment to do that.

615
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,040
May God bless you all.
