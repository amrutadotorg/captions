00:00.000 --> 00:06.023
Gudi Padwa Puja, Palam Vihar, Gurgaon (India), 13 April 2002.

00:10.102 --> 00:17.022
The festival of Gudi Padwa  that we are celebrating today,

00:17.843 --> 00:23.707
is also celebrated in other parts of India, even in the South.

00:26.961 --> 00:32.082
Everywhere this festival is celebrated.

00:32.953 --> 00:38.962
The ‘Samvat’ calendar year that was started  and the calendar year started by Shalivahanas,

00:39.307 --> 00:41.488
both start on the same day.

00:41.756 --> 00:44.321
That day is today.

00:46.318 --> 00:49.330
All over the country this day (New Year) is celebrated.

00:49.711 --> 00:53.364
All the important dates in the year are fixed on

00:53.880 --> 00:57.609
that basis especially the festivals.

00:57.861 --> 01:06.027
We people (Indians) follow the lunar calendar

01:06.506 --> 01:11.854
whereas the westerners follow the sun calendar.

01:12.609 --> 01:17.441
That’s why their festival dates do not change.

01:19.949 --> 01:29.329
Here (in India ) every festival is based on the position of the moon.

01:30.202 --> 01:33.867
And that’s why the dates keep changing

01:34.146 --> 01:38.679
and the same festival falls on different dates, in different years.

01:46.337 --> 01:54.024
The reason why we give importance to the moon

01:56.153 --> 02:00.322
and keep all our dates according to its position,

02:00.640 --> 02:08.125
is that the moon has an influence on human beings.

02:08.879 --> 02:11.505
The sun does not.

02:11.704 --> 02:18.767
Along with the moon, other planets also have influence on us.

02:19.629 --> 02:24.628
That is why we follow the lunar calendar

02:24.761 --> 02:30.513
and fix our festivals accordingly.

02:35.443 --> 02:38.286
There is one festival however,

02:38.459 --> 02:42.902
where the date is as per position of the sun.

02:43.101 --> 02:45.403
When the sun starts

02:45.536 --> 02:54.509
its movement from southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere,

02:55.618 --> 03:01.014
that date is celebrated as a festival (Sankranti).

03:01.623 --> 03:06.676
In our country the science of astrology is
also based on the positions of the moon.

03:06.762 --> 03:12.727
In astrology also the positions of the moon
are taken into consideration.

03:12.860 --> 03:16.720
The first calendar that was made here

03:17.439 --> 03:23.619
which is called as Shalivahana Shaka is based
on the movements of the moon.

03:23.910 --> 03:29.965
That is why all the festivals are based on the position of the moon.

03:30.518 --> 03:34.060
Those people who are not aware of our (Indian) system

03:34.537 --> 03:40.280
of dates will not be able to understand

03:40.505 --> 03:45.259
why our festivals fall on different dates, in different years.

03:45.551 --> 03:49.691
Whatever it is, we must think as to

03:49.784 --> 03:53.241
why we give so much importance to the moon.

03:53.466 --> 03:57.703
The reason is that we should remain vigilant

03:57.968 --> 04:03.543
about the effects that the moon has on us.

04:04.533 --> 04:07.882
The biggest effect that the moon has on us is

04:08.081 --> 04:11.509
because our left side is based on it.

04:11.972 --> 04:15.331
Very few people know about it.

04:15.768 --> 04:20.203
This left side of the body which is recognised

04:20.309 --> 04:28.399
and accepted so much in our country,
has psychological effects on us.

04:29.165 --> 04:34.064
Effects on the left side are psychological

04:34.389 --> 04:38.709
and not intellectual, and we cannot control it.

04:39.297 --> 04:45.183
Whatever psychological problems we have,
cannot be controlled.

04:45.530 --> 04:50.670
We cannot control the effect of the moon on us.

04:51.219 --> 04:56.391
That’s why the position of the moon is seen
and lunar dates are observed.

04:56.566 --> 05:00.952
For example if it is a no-moon night (Amavasya) or

05:01.057 --> 05:05.888
a full moon night (Poornima) then the problem of a person,

05:06.586 --> 05:13.879
having epilepsy or any other psychological problem,
will aggravate further.

05:14.359 --> 05:17.840
One can immediately see very clearly

05:17.930 --> 05:23.996
that such a person has been affected by the full moon or no-moon.

05:24.178 --> 05:29.916
That’s why we are very much sensitive

05:30.406 --> 05:34.731
towards the position of moon and date of lunar month.

05:34.885 --> 05:39.095
In our country detailed calculations are done on this,

05:39.205 --> 05:42.806
to know about the exact timings

05:42.933 --> 05:46.265
and position of the eclipse and when it will end.

05:46.527 --> 05:53.854
All this shows that in our country a lot of care is taken

05:54.028 --> 06:03.553
about the positions of the moon  on the of lunar calendar

06:03.751 --> 06:10.007
and so much has been discussed  and written about it.

06:11.335 --> 06:14.972
Now we live in these modern times,  where the dates

06:15.176 --> 06:18.838
and festivals are based on
the position of the sun.

06:19.262 --> 06:20.968
But this is not correct.

06:21.352 --> 06:24.556
We must see the position of the moon-

06:24.675 --> 06:27.889
what is its position today, what will it be tomorrow,

06:28.115 --> 06:30.646
how it will affect us today.

06:30.844 --> 06:34.983
This is a very deep subject about which we all must know

06:35.275 --> 06:38.488
and it should be discussed in our country.

06:38.991 --> 06:46.490
So this day is celebrated because it’s a new year day

06:47.044 --> 06:56.839
and also because the new moon appears on this day.

06:57.221 --> 07:03.292
Its is called Gudi Padwa.

07:03.847 --> 07:18.545
On this day they put up a small pitcher on a stick with a small flag.

07:19.135 --> 07:24.981
The pitcher represents the Kundalini.

07:25.851 --> 07:34.297
Shalivahana Kings were worshippers of the Goddess

07:34.536 --> 07:39.794
and it is said that they used to present a Shawl to the Goddess.

07:40.257 --> 07:44.283
They were also called as Satvahanas in the beginning,

07:44.442 --> 07:50.798
because they recognised the seven chakras
(Satvahana means seven chakras).

07:51.031 --> 08:00.477
That’s why they were earlier called as Satvahana but later it changed to Shalivahana.

08:00.971 --> 08:06.201
But the symbol of Shalivahana used to be Gudi,

08:06.305 --> 08:08.674
means a flag,

08:09.441 --> 08:21.172
and above that a pitcher of a particular shape,

08:21.562 --> 08:26.575
which represented the Kundalini.

08:26.972 --> 08:30.792
They were worshippers of Kundalini.
They recognised and worshipped Kundalini.

08:30.885 --> 08:35.884
That is the reason that they have made it like this, and all those, who accepted it,

08:35.957 --> 08:40.231
also put up a ‘Gudi’ in their houses.

08:40.363 --> 08:43.954
You can say they put up a flag.

08:44.133 --> 08:50.363
They (Shalivahans) wanted to welcome Kundalini on this day

08:50.388 --> 08:58.498
and that is why Kundalini (in the form of pitcher)
was exhibited specially on that day.

08:59.037 --> 09:02.375
But people do not know why it is done like that.

09:02.522 --> 09:04.219
They just go on doing things like that.

09:04.244 --> 09:07.672
At least they should ask, why it is done like this?

09:07.697 --> 09:10.012
What is this thing?

09:10.444 --> 09:14.064
Because they were Satvahana and accepted the seven chakras,

09:14.237 --> 09:18.463
they used to worship and protect the Kundalini,

09:18.860 --> 09:23.747
so they started their new year like this.

09:23.946 --> 09:27.229
They celebrated their new year

09:27.613 --> 09:32.948
in which there was a small pitcher

09:33.544 --> 09:35.209
and below that a flag ,

09:35.263 --> 09:39.429
called Gudi, was attached.

09:41.337 --> 09:45.937
Here (in Delhi/North India) people do not know about it.

09:46.030 --> 09:52.288
But Samvat Year and Vikram year,
both started from this day.

09:52.447 --> 09:57.591
It may be that the year in which they started was different,

09:57.829 --> 10:04.968
but the date that both started was the same, i.e. today’s date.

10:04.993 --> 10:09.423
Both recognised the same no-moon night.

10:09.897 --> 10:15.354
In this way this Gudi Padwa is observed by both.

10:15.425 --> 10:17.857
Not on no-moon night,

10:17.882 --> 10:21.932
but  on the first day of the new fortnight (Prathama).

10:21.957 --> 10:26.797
This is why there is no moon in the sky tonight,

10:26.971 --> 10:29.694
and it is completely dark.

10:29.767 --> 10:37.187
But we must know why it is celebrated in our country

10:37.291 --> 10:40.362
and what is its importance.

10:40.480 --> 10:45.260
Unless and until we know about our country,

10:45.319 --> 10:49.823
we will not be able to have respect and love for it.

10:49.849 --> 10:52.363
There are a lot of very deep

10:52.417 --> 10:56.116
and important things about our country

10:56.401 --> 11:00.597
but we do not know about them.

11:00.622 --> 11:02.235
We just say it is Kaliyuga.

11:02.501 --> 11:07.764
We just hear a few things and start talking about it.

11:08.029 --> 11:10.918
There is a big story about this Kaliyuga which took place

11:10.992 --> 11:13.246
in the times of King Parikshit.

11:13.416 --> 11:16.058
Nobody knows about it and no one reads about it.

11:16.151 --> 11:17.854
We keep reading useless things.

11:18.008 --> 11:20.285
At the most we sometimes read Ramayana.

11:20.465 --> 11:23.527
But what is the message behind it?

11:23.591 --> 11:27.920
What are the scriptures , nobody knows.

11:28.486 --> 11:31.231
Sahaja yogis must know how our civilisation has evolved

11:31.366 --> 11:34.632
and how we have arrived to this present state.

11:34.775 --> 11:39.478
Without knowing all this we develop an understanding like the western World

11:45.162 --> 11:48.050
,which has no depth, and only gives us ego.

11:48.371 --> 11:52.173
It is better to understand from where

11:52.404 --> 11:56.791
we have acquired all these things within us and what is their importance.

11:57.021 --> 11:58.562
Why we celebrate all these festivals.

11:58.611 --> 12:02.095
Just because everybody else is doing this so we also do the same.

12:02.179 --> 12:04.186
This kind of attitude is not all right.

12:04.276 --> 12:07.339
We must understand what we are doing.

12:07.423 --> 12:10.440
I want that all Sahaja Yogis should understand

12:10.655 --> 12:12.655
the significance of all these.

12:12.744 --> 12:19.795
If I had the time, I would have written all this for you.
But I do not have time.

12:20.053 --> 12:22.339
You can read and know all about it.

12:22.395 --> 12:25.305
There are so many books about it in Hindi language in India.

12:25.437 --> 12:27.646
Nobody reads them.

12:27.898 --> 12:30.311
They are all available here in Delhi.

12:30.398 --> 12:32.832
I bought them in Delhi only.

12:32.998 --> 12:36.590
So we must know all about it.

12:36.801 --> 12:40.610
In the mythology, a lot of useful things are mentioned which once understood,

12:40.697 --> 12:46.673
Why we Indians are considered the most superior human beings.

12:46.845 --> 12:50.914
will tell us what is the foundation of India.

12:51.626 --> 12:55.009
Not from the social point of view

12:55.034 --> 12:59.188
but culturally we people are considered supreme.

12:59.235 --> 13:02.409
Secondly we also must know

13:02.550 --> 13:07.058
how we should be established in our religion,

13:07.133 --> 13:08.859
what is religion?

13:09.236 --> 13:13.180
All these things are mentioned in depth in all these books.

13:13.223 --> 13:18.052
I want that all of you should study this
and it will give you a new direction.

13:18.357 --> 13:27.073
The foreign languages
or foreign knowledge are all very superficial.

13:27.603 --> 13:35.076
I purchased a lot of books from Satya Sahitya
(name of bookshop)

13:35.459 --> 13:40.766
It is a good shop and I bought a lot of books from there.

13:41.155 --> 13:46.102
It does not cost much. It is very cheap.

13:46.288 --> 13:49.648
But you need time to read all that.

13:49.845 --> 13:54.924
We keep reading useless things,
watch useless movies,

13:55.004 --> 13:57.578
read useless news items.

13:57.630 --> 14:09.679
Our study should be in depth and in subjects
which we have been having since ages.

14:09.774 --> 14:12.527
Today it is a very auspicious day.

14:12.686 --> 14:18.509
I was not feeling well but I thought on this auspicious occasion

14:18.630 --> 14:20.600
I must have the Puja.

14:20.878 --> 14:22.955
Eternal Blessings to all of you.
