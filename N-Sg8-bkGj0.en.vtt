00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:46.574
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:18:58.213 --> 00:18:59.875
You are here

00:19:00.445 --> 00:19:02.607
to feel the truth.

00:19:06.873 --> 00:19:08.704
And not to

00:19:08.905 --> 00:19:12.013
just conceptualise it mentally.

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:23.091
Now, there’s a question yesterday, people asked

00:19:23.291 --> 00:19:25.583
that what is the difference

00:19:25.783 --> 00:19:29.513
between Sahaja Yoga and other yogas.

00:19:39.462 --> 00:19:41.548
All these yogas

00:19:41.829 --> 00:19:43.942
have been written down by

00:19:44.143 --> 00:19:47.510
a saint called Patanjali, long time back.

00:19:56.745 --> 00:19:59.639
And he called it Ashtanga Yoga,

00:20:00.237 --> 00:20:03.838
Ashtanga, with eight facets.

00:20:09.594 --> 00:20:12.247
He existed thousands of years back,

00:20:12.447 --> 00:20:15.208
and that time we had a system in which

00:20:15.409 --> 00:20:18.307
the students went into the university

00:20:18.507 --> 00:20:22.190
to study under some enlightened soul,

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:24.793
a guru, satguru.

00:20:45.482 --> 00:20:48.657
So, there are eight facets

00:20:48.857 --> 00:20:52.445
of the Yoga, mean union with the divine.

00:20:58.896 --> 00:21:01.037
So, he has got,

00:21:01.427 --> 00:21:03.004
the first one as yama.

00:21:03.204 --> 00:21:07.083
Yama Niyama. Yama is the first one

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:09.211
in which he has written

00:21:09.411 --> 00:21:11.458
what we have to do

00:21:11.659 --> 00:21:14.763
to make our breathing all right

00:21:14.964 --> 00:21:18.964
or to control our misbehaviour.

00:21:37.709 --> 00:21:39.743
So, one-third of that

00:21:39.943 --> 00:21:41.252
is the asanas

00:21:41.452 --> 00:21:44.589
where you do physical exercises for a particular

00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:46.677
type of problem.

00:22:01.412 --> 00:22:03.086
But that is not

00:22:03.373 --> 00:22:05.314
Hatha Yoga. Hatha Yoga

00:22:05.514 --> 00:22:08.866
is a complete Patajali Yoga Shastra,

00:22:09.066 --> 00:22:13.066
Yoga – that is complete Patanjali Yoga scripture.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.230
Asanas or these

00:22:27.653 --> 00:22:30.328
practices of physical exercises

00:22:30.528 --> 00:22:33.666
is a very wee bit, is one one-twenty fourth

00:22:33.866 --> 00:22:35.451
of one of them.

00:22:48.611 --> 00:22:50.411
‘Ha’ and ‘Tha’,

00:22:50.611 --> 00:22:52.458
Ha means the sun

00:22:52.658 --> 00:22:54.395
and Tha means the moon.

00:22:54.595 --> 00:22:56.523
So both are

00:22:56.724 --> 00:22:59.380
considered in Hatha Yoga.

00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:16.294
Because we are not only physical beings.

00:23:20.924 --> 00:23:22.900
We are physical being,

00:23:23.234 --> 00:23:24.739
we are mental being,

00:23:24.939 --> 00:23:28.213
we are emotional being, we are spiritual being.

00:23:35.098 --> 00:23:37.782
So only to keep your physical being

00:23:37.982 --> 00:23:39.793
is not so important.

00:23:47.586 --> 00:23:48.953
One has to

00:23:49.154 --> 00:23:51.542
understand that

00:23:52.308 --> 00:23:55.615
all these things were done by a realised soul

00:23:55.815 --> 00:23:57.508
who knew what

00:23:57.708 --> 00:24:00.499
asanas are to be used, what physical exercises are

00:24:00.699 --> 00:24:03.385
to be used for a particular person.

00:24:20.306 --> 00:24:24.059
But some of the people who went to the

00:24:24.259 --> 00:24:26.363
gurus in Himalayas,

00:24:26.563 --> 00:24:30.560
and they were very greedy people, not good

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.258
for any kind of yoga.

00:24:45.967 --> 00:24:48.527
So, the gurus told them

00:24:48.727 --> 00:24:52.014
that you’d better do physical exercises,

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.328
just to get rid of them.

00:25:03.485 --> 00:25:04.831
So they came down

00:25:05.031 --> 00:25:08.421
and they started teaching all these acrobats.

00:25:15.113 --> 00:25:17.905
But such a craze now that

00:25:18.105 --> 00:25:19.786
people don’t know what are the

00:25:19.986 --> 00:25:22.321
side effects of this kind of

00:25:22.521 --> 00:25:24.950
imbalanced behaviour.

00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:41.021
The right side if you use too much,

00:25:41.221 --> 00:25:44.398
the left side is completely neglected.

00:25:51.661 --> 00:25:54.171
So such people become very dry

00:25:54.371 --> 00:25:58.115
by nature, there is no love, no compassion.

00:26:09.737 --> 00:26:12.300
They become very hot-tempered

00:26:12.885 --> 00:26:15.289
and they try

00:26:15.489 --> 00:26:19.187
to get angry at the slightest pretext.

00:26:27.774 --> 00:26:30.654
Sometimes are so hot-tempered that

00:26:30.854 --> 00:26:34.854
you have to go near them with a barge pole in between, you see.

00:26:42.752 --> 00:26:46.356
They become horrid fathers or mothers,

00:26:46.556 --> 00:26:49.115
and always fight with each other

00:26:49.315 --> 00:26:51.977
and mostly end up with divorces.

00:27:00.444 --> 00:27:03.145
And the women who do too much of this Hatha yoga

00:27:03.345 --> 00:27:05.749
cannot even produce children.

00:27:16.151 --> 00:27:19.226
They become so dominating that

00:27:19.426 --> 00:27:21.442
it is difficult to make out whether they are a

00:27:21.642 --> 00:27:24.142
man, or a woman, or a tiger.

00:27:35.202 --> 00:27:36.602
So –

00:27:38.356 --> 00:27:41.213
but in the Patanjali Yoga Shastra,

00:27:41.413 --> 00:27:42.999
it is described

00:27:44.186 --> 00:27:48.048
those physical exercises required for physical correction

00:27:48.248 --> 00:27:51.005
of your spinal cord.

00:28:02.808 --> 00:28:05.802
So, when the Kundalini rises,

00:28:06.003 --> 00:28:09.452
you see the problem on what centre it is,

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:13.021
and you try to

00:28:13.839 --> 00:28:15.858
try to improve

00:28:16.058 --> 00:28:18.816
that particular chakras.

00:28:34.152 --> 00:28:38.117
For example, if your this centre is catching, Agnya,

00:28:38.558 --> 00:28:41.580
then you have to say ‘I forgive everyone’,

00:28:41.781 --> 00:28:44.749
otherwise it won’t open at any cost.

00:28:59.047 --> 00:29:01.113
So, unless and until

00:29:01.313 --> 00:29:03.136
the Kundalini moves,

00:29:03.336 --> 00:29:06.152
how will you know what’s the blockade?

00:29:13.816 --> 00:29:16.251
And then, how will you know

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:20.011
what Asana is to be done or not to be done.

00:29:26.155 --> 00:29:29.658
So, it is like taking all the medicines from the medicine box

00:29:29.859 --> 00:29:31.859
thinking you are very sick.

00:29:43.557 --> 00:29:46.326
So, it is so indiscriminate.

00:29:50.446 --> 00:29:52.604
Now, the second one is Raja Yoga

00:29:52.805 --> 00:29:56.140
where it is said that you have to

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.244
know that when the Kundalini rises

00:30:00.445 --> 00:30:04.285
there are certain places like valves on the centres.

00:30:04.485 --> 00:30:07.309
They stop the Kundalini from

00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:09.009
falling down.

00:30:23.187 --> 00:30:25.369
Now, when the

00:30:25.569 --> 00:30:27.590
Kundalini rises just like the

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:29.985
car starts, gets ignited,

00:30:30.185 --> 00:30:33.622
all the machinery starts working automatically.

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:47.592
Also, the tongue is a little bit

00:30:47.792 --> 00:30:51.809
pulled inside which you don’t feel, but it is pulled inside a little bit.

00:30:52.009 --> 00:30:55.342
Because the Kundalini should not fall down

00:30:55.542 --> 00:30:57.149
from this centre.

00:31:07.519 --> 00:31:09.019
But today’s

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:11.768
horrible this Raja yoga is

00:31:11.968 --> 00:31:13.511
that they cut the thread of the

00:31:13.711 --> 00:31:17.052
tongue and the tongue wags like a dog’s tongue,

00:31:17.252 --> 00:31:19.535
you can’t talk, you can’t eat.

00:31:30.821 --> 00:31:33.244
This is to put the tongue back.

00:31:33.577 --> 00:31:37.577
For what are you putting, there is no Kundalini, what are you stopping there?

00:31:47.347 --> 00:31:50.600
That automatic action is called as Khechari

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.205
and these people are artificially doing it.

00:32:04.329 --> 00:32:07.661
I have seen many people in Los Angeles, old people

00:32:07.861 --> 00:32:11.612
whom I knew also, having that kind of a tongue.

00:32:20.495 --> 00:32:22.020
So they teach

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:25.660
they teach you to hold your stomach, to hold here,

00:32:26.658 --> 00:32:29.693
but there is no Kundalini, what are you holding?

00:32:39.933 --> 00:32:43.742
When the car has not started what is the use of putting the choke

00:32:43.942 --> 00:32:47.020
or taking out a wheel and moving it?

00:32:55.198 --> 00:32:57.491
It is so artificial.

00:33:00.252 --> 00:33:01.897
Then somebody has asked me

00:33:02.097 --> 00:33:04.008
– this is they call as akriya,

00:33:04.208 --> 00:33:05.732
Kriya yoga.

00:33:05.932 --> 00:33:09.315
But Sahaja Yoga is a-kriya. Kriya means action,

00:33:09.515 --> 00:33:12.908
what action can you do to raise the Kundalini?

00:33:23.521 --> 00:33:26.967
If you have to sprout the seed,

00:33:27.577 --> 00:33:29.343
what action do you take?

00:33:29.543 --> 00:33:32.618
You just put the seed in the mother earth. Finished.

00:33:40.782 --> 00:33:44.101
Now you open the seed, take out the primule

00:33:44.301 --> 00:33:47.292
and push it back, do you think,

00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:50.092
do you think it will sprout?

00:33:58.835 --> 00:34:00.607
This is how so many

00:34:00.807 --> 00:34:03.490
beautiful seekers are harmed.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.796
There are so many like that.

00:34:13.187 --> 00:34:14.984
Funny, funny things.

00:34:18.232 --> 00:34:22.167
Like they just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.631
Big lectures, big, big books,

00:34:28.831 --> 00:34:31.562
talking of big, big, things.

00:34:39.968 --> 00:34:43.380
Because you people have not heard of these words,

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.533
they go on writing all kinds

00:34:45.733 --> 00:34:48.055
of nonsense and you have to digest it.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.060
There are all types of people

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:08.589
who are telling you, “Take the name of somebody,

00:35:09.099 --> 00:35:10.850
go on chanting something”.

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:13.551
Or they say that you read this book,

00:35:13.751 --> 00:35:15.524
read that book.

00:35:27.803 --> 00:35:31.068
How many books did Christ read?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.005
Think of it, this kind of stupidity they

00:35:39.205 --> 00:35:41.214
are spreading all over.

00:35:41.414 --> 00:35:44.414
And you have to use your brains.

00:35:53.962 --> 00:35:56.029
The other day I met a person

00:35:56.229 --> 00:36:00.229
who had made a little book of Gita in gold and put it here.

00:36:13.818 --> 00:36:16.245
And he said his guru is selling this

00:36:16.445 --> 00:36:18.487
and that now he is in the heavens,

00:36:18.687 --> 00:36:20.747
just imaginary.

00:36:31.149 --> 00:36:33.645
But it is said about all this falsehood,

00:36:33.845 --> 00:36:37.116
has been written down by so many saints.

00:36:44.649 --> 00:36:46.919
Guru Nanaka has said that,

00:36:47.119 --> 00:36:48.660
“The one who meets you, God,

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:52.069
is the only Satguru, is the only guru”.

00:37:03.533 --> 00:37:05.939
So, all these funny ideas

00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:09.483
that are written down or have been told to you,

00:37:09.683 --> 00:37:11.081
given lectures,

00:37:11.281 --> 00:37:14.458
are all to be understood in one way,

00:37:24.529 --> 00:37:28.529
that: “What have you got out of it?”.

00:37:34.902 --> 00:37:38.356
Like somebody said he has got a diamond.

00:37:42.212 --> 00:37:45.135
But diamond you can get in the market!

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.298
All right.

00:37:49.499 --> 00:37:52.393
And he himself is a heart patient.

00:37:59.552 --> 00:38:02.560
And he came to me for curing himself.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:06.920
So, I told him, first of all, give up this

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.853
diamond to some poor man, then come to me.

00:38:15.976 --> 00:38:19.904
Then there are other types also, who mesmerise you.

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:29.696
But they have no knowledge, nothing.

00:38:33.341 --> 00:38:34.843
Just they get mesmerized

00:38:35.043 --> 00:38:37.654
and they said we had an experience.

00:38:44.433 --> 00:38:47.384
But they have no knowledge as to what has happened,

00:38:47.584 --> 00:38:48.980
what is within you,

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:51.553
how to work it out, nothing.

00:39:00.347 --> 00:39:03.409
Only what they feel

00:39:03.693 --> 00:39:06.471
that, “Oh, something has happened to us”.

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:12.845
Also, don’t know what has happened to them.

00:39:15.961 --> 00:39:18.185
So with this kind of

00:39:18.385 --> 00:39:19.780
your understanding,

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:23.101
you are definitely going to get lost.

00:39:29.792 --> 00:39:32.130
You have to know that

00:39:32.331 --> 00:39:35.404
anybody who takes money from you,

00:39:35.604 --> 00:39:38.523
for giving you realisation or anything,

00:39:38.723 --> 00:39:40.800
is a false person.

00:39:51.418 --> 00:39:54.009
It’s all right, they can pay for the hall,

00:39:54.209 --> 00:39:56.088
or they can pay for the aeroplane,

00:39:56.288 --> 00:39:59.103
but you cannot pay for Self-realisation.

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.637
Then third thing you must see

00:40:09.837 --> 00:40:13.039
what is happening to the disciples.

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:23.079
Now disciples have become like mad people,

00:40:23.279 --> 00:40:25.379
some are in the lunatic asylum,

00:40:25.579 --> 00:40:27.144
some are begging,

00:40:27.344 --> 00:40:28.844
some are

00:40:29.371 --> 00:40:32.351
aggressive, violent people.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:46.756
Such people, how can they be spiritual?

00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:55.812
There is no knowledge, there is no love, there is no compassion.

00:41:00.195 --> 00:41:02.888
So, what’s the use of wasting your energy

00:41:03.089 --> 00:41:05.189
with something so nonsensical, because

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:07.626
you have never known it before?

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:20.060
Anything new should not be accepted

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:21.864
blindfolded.

00:41:27.242 --> 00:41:29.911
But we should, first of all,

00:41:30.111 --> 00:41:31.750
understand it

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:35.695
in our full awareness

00:41:41.768 --> 00:41:44.800
and then we should accept.

00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.907
Of course,

00:41:51.257 --> 00:41:52.751
the mesmerism is very

00:41:52.951 --> 00:41:56.541
easy because you can mesmerise thousands of people.

00:42:05.991 --> 00:42:07.300
But to create

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.502
really knowledgeable, dynamic,

00:42:09.702 --> 00:42:12.377
compassionate, effective

00:42:12.577 --> 00:42:15.603
and powerful people is very difficult.

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:27.103
After Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:27.303 --> 00:42:31.028
you will see that you become extremely powerful.

00:42:37.334 --> 00:42:39.647
And you’ll know what power you have.

00:42:42.868 --> 00:42:45.163
And you’ll know that this is the power

00:42:45.363 --> 00:42:46.790
of love.

00:42:50.351 --> 00:42:53.775
You all the time feel the bliss of God.

00:42:58.448 --> 00:43:00.718
And every time you can find out

00:43:00.918 --> 00:43:03.776
whether it is truth or not.

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:13.073
So when you get your realisation,

00:43:13.273 --> 00:43:15.651
then first you feel the cool breeze

00:43:15.851 --> 00:43:18.432
of the Holy Ghost for the first time,

00:43:18.632 --> 00:43:21.582
and on your fingertips you can feel

00:43:21.782 --> 00:43:25.622
the centres that are yours and the centres of others.

00:43:41.489 --> 00:43:44.147
Also, you know how to use it.

00:43:48.519 --> 00:43:51.149
You can see here there are some English,

00:43:51.349 --> 00:43:53.434
some Italians,

00:43:54.019 --> 00:43:56.523
from all over the world, people are singing

00:43:56.724 --> 00:43:58.997
Sanskrit songs.

00:44:08.894 --> 00:44:11.299
Sanskrit is the most difficult language,

00:44:11.499 --> 00:44:13.589
worse than even Latin.

00:44:19.084 --> 00:44:20.493
And even to speak

00:44:20.693 --> 00:44:23.483
Hindi by these people is a difficult thing.

00:44:29.002 --> 00:44:31.061
And the speed with which they sing,

00:44:31.261 --> 00:44:33.507
even an Indian can’t do it.

00:44:41.478 --> 00:44:45.478
Even the Swiss are doing that, Swiss! Who were so...

00:44:49.656 --> 00:44:51.734
And the English!

00:44:53.749 --> 00:44:55.437
Which is a miracle!

00:45:01.883 --> 00:45:03.956
And you can’t make them out

00:45:04.156 --> 00:45:07.234
who is English and who is a German.

00:45:15.408 --> 00:45:18.556
We have many Jews who worship Christ.

00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:28.060
And we have many Muslims who worship Rama.

00:45:32.031 --> 00:45:35.747
The other day I saw one Irani and Iraqi

00:45:35.947 --> 00:45:38.825
just hugging each other and

00:45:39.101 --> 00:45:42.853
being very friendly. Iraqi and Irani.

00:45:55.284 --> 00:45:57.878
What a brotherhood they enjoy.

00:46:01.138 --> 00:46:04.599
Because they have become collectively conscious.

00:46:08.383 --> 00:46:11.612
All this is described in Patanjali.

00:46:16.107 --> 00:46:17.672
First, he says,

00:46:18.062 --> 00:46:21.839
is here is thoughtless awareness which he calls

00:46:22.054 --> 00:46:26.079
in Sanskrit language as Nirvichara Samadhi.

00:46:34.792 --> 00:46:37.023
And then here he calls it

00:46:37.223 --> 00:46:39.243
as doubtless awareness,

00:46:39.443 --> 00:46:42.770
which we call as Nirvikalpa Samadhi.

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:52.562
And this all-pervading power

00:46:52.762 --> 00:46:54.552
he calls as Ruthambara Pragnya.

00:46:54.752 --> 00:46:56.553
Ruthambara Pragnya.

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:03.532
See, that’s Italian.

00:47:07.142 --> 00:47:08.542
So,

00:47:13.458 --> 00:47:14.980
it’s a force within you,

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:18.508
it’s a force already within you, it’s your own.

00:47:23.345 --> 00:47:27.245
And is your own individual mother, this Kundalini is.

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.033
And you can feel it with a stethoscope,

00:47:35.904 --> 00:47:38.431
in some people when it moves slowly,

00:47:47.459 --> 00:47:50.393
till it reaches here on top of your head,

00:47:50.593 --> 00:47:52.966
you can feel the throbbing,

00:47:58.701 --> 00:48:00.303
till it breaks.

00:48:04.272 --> 00:48:08.272
And then you feel the cool breeze from your own head coming out.

00:48:14.836 --> 00:48:17.577
You feel very relaxed and peaceful.

00:48:20.344 --> 00:48:23.753
You feel the cool breeze all on your fingertips.

00:48:28.213 --> 00:48:31.018
Within a month’s time, you become a master.

00:48:33.964 --> 00:48:36.846
You can give realisation to others.

00:48:39.217 --> 00:48:41.186
You can cure others.

00:48:42.538 --> 00:48:46.226
And you become a very dynamic

00:48:46.426 --> 00:48:48.475
peaceful personality.

00:48:53.983 --> 00:48:56.422
Your face starts glowing.

00:48:56.622 --> 00:49:00.506
Your age drops ten years at least.

00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:12.287
There’s a glint in your eye.

00:49:12.613 --> 00:49:14.574
And you are a saint!

00:49:20.054 --> 00:49:23.171
You become a very sane innocent person.

00:49:27.537 --> 00:49:30.841
And the whole life becomes a real fun.

00:49:35.836 --> 00:49:39.200
You are so relaxed that every day it’s a holiday.

00:49:44.875 --> 00:49:48.543
With all the dynamism, you are extremely relaxed.

00:49:54.250 --> 00:49:58.250
They told me that the whole of Italy is on holiday.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.558
They have all gone to Spain

00:50:03.758 --> 00:50:06.492
and all the Spanish have come here.

00:50:10.678 --> 00:50:14.633
So I said “All right, I will give realisation to Spanish in Italy”.

00:50:20.813 --> 00:50:23.404
And then, after the holiday they are exhausted,

00:50:23.604 --> 00:50:26.967
so they need another holiday to get over the exhaustion.

00:50:33.934 --> 00:50:37.762
So, you just start enjoying everything,

00:50:37.962 --> 00:50:41.962
every bit of your life, every moment.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:51.346
Because your Spirit is the source of joy.

00:50:55.483 --> 00:50:57.195
It is the source

00:50:57.396 --> 00:50:59.802
which gives you the truth.

00:51:03.123 --> 00:51:06.189
Ask any question, and

00:51:07.225 --> 00:51:09.580
if it is yes, you get cool breeze.

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:12.053
If it is no, you get heat.

00:51:25.308 --> 00:51:28.726
And you get answer to everything.

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:38.309
It’s so remarkable, it’s so great, that I cannot tell you

00:51:38.509 --> 00:51:41.552
how many miracles take place in your life.

00:51:51.487 --> 00:51:54.453
It is for you to enter into the Kingdom of God

00:51:54.653 --> 00:51:58.264
and see for yourself how beautiful it is to be there.

00:52:06.948 --> 00:52:08.750
So now we will have the

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:10.901
Realisation process.

00:52:11.315 --> 00:52:13.500
There were some questions,

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:15.720
which I have answered.

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.868
Now, he says that

00:52:20.068 --> 00:52:23.095
once he felt on the right hand

00:52:24.012 --> 00:52:26.200
the heat, and in the right…

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.762
No. On the left hand he felt the heat,

00:52:28.962 --> 00:52:31.528
and on the head he felt the cool. No,

00:52:31.728 --> 00:52:33.598
just the other way round. What did you feel.

00:52:33.798 --> 00:52:36.475
“In the right hand on the fontanel area

00:52:36.675 --> 00:52:39.645
I feel some heat, and cool on the right”.

00:52:39.845 --> 00:52:41.231
Right what, right hand?

00:52:41.431 --> 00:52:43.260
Yogi: Right hand.
Shri Mataji: All right, right hand.

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:46.258
Now. He says, on the right hand he feels cool

00:52:46.458 --> 00:52:50.060
and on the head he feels the hot. All right. What is the reason?

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:52.627
That in the head there is still heat.

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:56.845
Up to this point is cooled down, but the head is to be cleared out.

00:52:57.045 --> 00:52:59.839
For that you just have to ask the Mother Kundalini:

00:53:00.039 --> 00:53:03.984
“Mother Kundalini, come in my head”. That’s all.

00:53:45.531 --> 00:53:46.702
And

00:53:46.902 --> 00:53:50.690
another question is also very sweet. That:

00:53:51.037 --> 00:53:53.356
“I believe you are my Mother,

00:53:53.556 --> 00:53:56.179
but do you believe I’m your son?”.

00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:07.845
And very lovingly he says that,

00:54:08.045 --> 00:54:10.051
“When You go away to India,

00:54:10.251 --> 00:54:12.256
then what will I do here?”.

00:54:19.666 --> 00:54:22.139
Of course, you are my son

00:54:22.339 --> 00:54:25.878
and I’ll be always with you, whether in India or here.

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:40.236
Now let us have our

00:54:40.806 --> 00:54:42.080
realisation.

00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:43.988
Is the best way to do it.

00:54:44.188 --> 00:54:46.878
If you could – those people who are sitting down,

00:54:47.078 --> 00:54:50.003
can sit now on the chairs, some people have left.

00:54:58.897 --> 00:55:00.430
All the Indians have left,

00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:03.755
because they have come here to make money, that’s all.

00:55:05.633 --> 00:55:07.133
Thank God.

00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:16.354
Ask the Indians to sit at the back, always.

00:55:29.532 --> 00:55:32.232
I say Hindustani. That’s what Indians are.

00:55:32.432 --> 00:55:35.004
So ask Indians to sit at the back, always.

00:55:35.204 --> 00:55:37.063
Useless people.

00:55:38.698 --> 00:55:40.347
Those who are abroad.

00:55:43.503 --> 00:55:46.117
In India there are thousands, twelve thousand

00:55:46.317 --> 00:55:49.987
people coming to my programme, not one person moves!

00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:53.803
The Indians here are…

00:55:54.004 --> 00:55:56.153
I don’t know how they are here.

00:56:01.442 --> 00:56:03.091
Then should go back.

00:56:05.770 --> 00:56:08.721
- useless. But what I think they disturb us,

00:56:08.921 --> 00:56:12.285
they sit in the first seat and they go away.

00:56:30.616 --> 00:56:32.509
There are some seats here.

00:56:32.709 --> 00:56:35.593
There are some seats if you want, you can come here.

00:56:41.350 --> 00:56:43.894
Come along here; if you want there are some seats here also,

00:56:44.094 --> 00:56:45.696
in the front row.

00:56:47.191 --> 00:56:48.998
Those who want to sit can come.

00:57:03.514 --> 00:57:06.214
Yes, yes, if you want to sit please sit down.

00:57:06.415 --> 00:57:07.991
Be comfortable.

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:12.101
Come, come, sit.

00:57:27.541 --> 00:57:31.524
Now, it’s a very simple method.

00:57:32.182 --> 00:57:34.417
Sahaja means simple,

00:57:35.088 --> 00:57:38.512
and we’ll work it out in no time.

00:57:54.060 --> 00:57:55.925
It will hardly take about ten minutes,

00:57:56.125 --> 00:57:58.360
just ten minutes it will take.

00:58:18.749 --> 00:58:21.025
First I will show you

00:58:21.225 --> 00:58:24.505
how to nourish our centres

00:58:24.842 --> 00:58:28.696
and then you’ll have to close your eyes.

00:58:39.825 --> 00:58:42.252
So I have to request you to take out your shoes

00:58:42.452 --> 00:58:45.499
because this Mother Earth also helps us a lot.

00:58:51.912 --> 00:58:55.643
There’s a seat here. If you want you can sit here, there’s a seat

00:58:55.844 --> 00:58:56.960
for you.

00:58:57.756 --> 00:58:59.710
Here. There’s a seat here.

00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:03.087
And a seat there too, behind. Come along.

00:59:03.341 --> 00:59:05.779
All right, better you sit. Good.

00:59:10.484 --> 00:59:11.660
So,

00:59:13.806 --> 00:59:15.047
now,

00:59:15.248 --> 00:59:17.946
both the feet are to be kept apart from each other

00:59:18.146 --> 00:59:21.477
because there are two energies, left and right.

00:59:36.846 --> 00:59:38.500
You have to put the left hand

00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:40.254
like this,

00:59:45.456 --> 00:59:49.281
symbolising your desire, because this is the power of desire,

00:59:49.481 --> 00:59:52.401
desire to get Self-realisation.

01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:04.185
Now, right hand is to be used on the left-hand side

01:00:04.385 --> 01:00:06.568
of your body

01:00:06.768 --> 01:00:10.679
to nourish the centres, because it’s the power of action.

01:00:21.202 --> 01:00:23.762
As we had – yesterday I told you

01:00:23.962 --> 01:00:26.460
that there are two conditions.

01:00:31.930 --> 01:00:34.880
One condition is

01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:39.250
that you have to forgive yourself, forget the past.

01:00:45.992 --> 01:00:48.055
Just forget the past.

01:00:49.926 --> 01:00:53.365
You have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:01:00.379 --> 01:01:01.740
Forgive yourself.

01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:03.773
Don’t feel guilty.

01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:08.775
Not to feel guilty at all.

01:01:11.713 --> 01:01:13.437
The second one is that

01:01:13.638 --> 01:01:16.197
you have to forgive everyone.

01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:24.541
If you do not forgive everyone,

01:01:24.741 --> 01:01:26.966
then there will be a problem on this centre

01:01:27.166 --> 01:01:29.584
and the Kundalini won’t rise.

01:01:36.746 --> 01:01:39.450
So please forgive everyone

01:01:41.535 --> 01:01:43.192
from your heart,

01:01:44.348 --> 01:01:46.743
because if you forgive or don’t forgive,

01:01:46.943 --> 01:01:49.814
you don’t do anything, it’s a myth.

01:01:56.461 --> 01:01:57.997
But if you don’t forgive,

01:01:58.197 --> 01:02:00.357
then you are playing into wrong hands.

01:02:04.961 --> 01:02:06.374
Now, please

01:02:06.574 --> 01:02:09.164
put your left hand towards Me like this.

01:02:09.365 --> 01:02:11.200
All of you have to do it.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.967
Those who don’t want to do it should go away,

01:02:14.167 --> 01:02:16.162
they should not watch other people,

01:02:16.362 --> 01:02:17.914
it’s not civil.

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:35.148
All right. So, now, please put your left hand towards Me,

01:02:35.348 --> 01:02:37.981
and right hand on your heart.

01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:46.577
Here, now,

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.380
resides

01:02:50.237 --> 01:02:52.132
you should know

01:02:52.506 --> 01:02:54.426
the Spirit.

01:03:01.446 --> 01:03:03.551
So if you are the Spirit

01:03:03.751 --> 01:03:06.243
you are your guide.

01:03:12.422 --> 01:03:13.908
So now

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.295
you have to put your hand

01:03:16.495 --> 01:03:19.308
in the upper portion of your abdomen,

01:03:19.548 --> 01:03:21.163
on the left-hand side.

01:03:28.152 --> 01:03:30.849
Here is the centre

01:03:31.049 --> 01:03:32.957
of your mastery.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.212
So if you are the Spirit

01:03:40.413 --> 01:03:42.609
you become the Master.

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.843
Then take down your hand

01:03:49.044 --> 01:03:51.539
in the lower portion of your abdomen,

01:03:55.919 --> 01:03:57.458
on the left-hand side.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.119
This is the centre of pure knowledge.

01:04:06.448 --> 01:04:08.373
This pure knowledge

01:04:08.956 --> 01:04:12.109
manifests through your central nervous system.

01:04:19.301 --> 01:04:21.126
It is not a mental knowledge

01:04:21.326 --> 01:04:23.295
but a divine knowledge,

01:04:28.186 --> 01:04:30.530
by which you know

01:04:32.209 --> 01:04:34.621
what is the truth.

01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:44.513
You also know the divine laws:

01:04:49.006 --> 01:04:52.066
a new science I would say,

01:04:52.266 --> 01:04:53.967
of Divinity.

01:05:02.054 --> 01:05:04.729
Now you have to raise your hand

01:05:05.025 --> 01:05:08.071
in the upper portion of your abdomen again.

01:05:16.215 --> 01:05:18.496
Then on your heart,

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:29.013
and then in the corner of your neck

01:05:31.157 --> 01:05:33.557
and your shoulder.

01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:37.904
And turn your head to your right as much as you can.

01:05:41.318 --> 01:05:42.940
This is the centre

01:05:43.140 --> 01:05:45.260
which is blocked when you feel guilty,

01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:47.333
which is a very dangerous thing;

01:05:52.499 --> 01:05:53.958
you get spondylitis,

01:05:54.158 --> 01:05:57.157
angina, many diseases because of this.

01:06:06.493 --> 01:06:08.748
Now we put our hand

01:06:08.948 --> 01:06:10.620
on our forehead across

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.834
and bend our head,

01:06:13.034 --> 01:06:15.501
make it rest on your hand,

01:06:24.025 --> 01:06:27.243
and press it hard on both the sides.

01:06:33.711 --> 01:06:37.110
This is the centre where you forgive others.

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:43.264
Now you take back your hand

01:06:43.464 --> 01:06:45.212
on the backside of your head

01:06:45.412 --> 01:06:47.851
and push back your head on it,

01:06:52.932 --> 01:06:54.752
as much as you can.

01:06:58.002 --> 01:07:01.132
This is the centre where you have to ask for forgiveness

01:07:01.332 --> 01:07:04.093
from the Divine without feeling guilty,

01:07:04.293 --> 01:07:06.737
without counting your mistakes.

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:17.606
Now stretch your hand,

01:07:19.559 --> 01:07:22.180
stretch it nicely, and put the centre

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:26.204
of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area,

01:07:26.404 --> 01:07:29.242
which was the soft bone in your childhood.

01:07:36.209 --> 01:07:38.202
Push back your fingers,

01:07:41.967 --> 01:07:45.180
push back your fingers, put a nice pressure

01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:47.899
on the fontanel bone

01:07:49.709 --> 01:07:51.353
and move your scalp

01:07:51.553 --> 01:07:53.992
seven times clockwise,

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.679
very slowly.

01:08:04.728 --> 01:08:06.634
That’s all you have to do.

01:08:24.956 --> 01:08:27.644
All right, take down your hands now.

01:08:30.746 --> 01:08:33.416
Now you have to close your eyes

01:08:33.616 --> 01:08:36.004
and not to open them,

01:08:39.931 --> 01:08:41.431
till I tell you.

01:08:43.673 --> 01:08:46.139
Please put the left hand towards me,

01:08:49.193 --> 01:08:51.775
and both feet apart from each other.

01:08:56.231 --> 01:08:58.228
Put the right hand on your heart

01:08:58.428 --> 01:09:00.465
and close your eyes.

01:09:08.022 --> 01:09:11.048
Here, you have to ask me

01:09:12.376 --> 01:09:14.173
a question three times,

01:09:14.373 --> 01:09:16.566
which is very important

01:09:16.766 --> 01:09:19.014
– you can call me Shri Mataji

01:09:19.214 --> 01:09:21.811
or Mother, whatever suits you –

01:09:22.107 --> 01:09:24.540
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:26.777
Ask this three times.

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.825
Now, if you are the Spirit,

01:09:48.441 --> 01:09:52.087
then you are your own master,

01:09:58.746 --> 01:10:01.340
so please take your right hand

01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:02.733
in the lower part

01:10:02.934 --> 01:10:06.928
in the upper part of your abdomen and press it hard.

01:10:15.185 --> 01:10:17.511
Here you ask me a question,

01:10:17.711 --> 01:10:19.597
again three times:

01:10:19.797 --> 01:10:23.012
“Mother, am I my own Master?”

01:10:40.309 --> 01:10:41.861
Three times.

01:10:44.362 --> 01:10:45.940
I have already told you

01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:49.003
that I respect your freedom

01:10:54.354 --> 01:10:56.497
and I cannot

01:10:57.545 --> 01:11:01.127
force pure knowledge on you.

01:11:08.007 --> 01:11:10.125
You have to ask for it.

01:11:14.915 --> 01:11:16.649
So now, you put

01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:20.478
your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen.

01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:28.751
Press it hard

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:31.204
and six times please say:

01:11:31.404 --> 01:11:32.740
“Mother,

01:11:33.230 --> 01:11:35.573
please give me pure knowledge”,

01:11:35.773 --> 01:11:37.208
because this

01:11:37.409 --> 01:11:40.991
chakra, this centre, has got six petals.

01:12:10.475 --> 01:12:11.975
Now,

01:12:15.057 --> 01:12:16.675
as soon as you say

01:12:16.875 --> 01:12:20.804
you want pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising.

01:12:31.553 --> 01:12:33.041
So we have to clear

01:12:33.241 --> 01:12:36.744
the upper centres by nourishing it with our

01:12:36.944 --> 01:12:38.657
self-confidence.

01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:51.757
So now raise your hand

01:12:51.957 --> 01:12:54.250
onto the upper portion of your abdomen

01:12:54.450 --> 01:12:56.910
on the left-hand side and press it hard.

01:13:03.409 --> 01:13:06.010
This is the centre of your mastery.

01:13:09.748 --> 01:13:11.620
So to open the centre

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.994
you please say with full confidence, ten times:

01:13:15.194 --> 01:13:18.852
“Mother, I am my own Master”.

01:13:32.932 --> 01:13:36.932
Now, we have to know that

01:13:37.647 --> 01:13:41.285
we are not this body, we are not this mind,

01:13:41.485 --> 01:13:43.344
we are not these emotions,

01:13:43.544 --> 01:13:46.598
and we are not this intellect.

01:13:56.885 --> 01:14:00.188
We are not our conditionings, we are not our ego,

01:14:00.388 --> 01:14:03.411
but we are pure Spirit.

01:14:11.024 --> 01:14:14.189
So raise your right hand on your heart,

01:14:17.839 --> 01:14:21.017
and say with full confidence, twelve times:

01:14:21.217 --> 01:14:23.386
“Mother, I am the Spirit”,

01:14:23.586 --> 01:14:26.619
which is the greatest truth about yourself.

01:14:38.917 --> 01:14:42.656
Now, we have to know that

01:14:45.064 --> 01:14:48.986
the all-pervading power

01:14:51.038 --> 01:14:53.369
of Divine Love

01:14:53.569 --> 01:14:56.951
is the ocean of compassion

01:14:57.373 --> 01:14:59.142
and love.

01:15:09.284 --> 01:15:11.644
It is the ocean of

01:15:11.845 --> 01:15:14.065
bliss and joy.

01:15:19.413 --> 01:15:20.854
Above all,

01:15:21.054 --> 01:15:24.085
it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:30.975
So whatever mistakes you commit

01:15:31.175 --> 01:15:34.558
can be easily dissolved by this ocean.

01:15:45.085 --> 01:15:46.726
So now,

01:15:49.145 --> 01:15:52.892
please be happy with yourself, forgive yourself,

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:01.980
and put your right hand

01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:05.190
on your - in your corner

01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:08.610
of shoulder and your head, quite

01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:13.024
at the back, pushing it on the backside,

01:16:13.225 --> 01:16:15.997
and turn your head to your right.

01:16:31.439 --> 01:16:33.143
Here you have to say

01:16:33.343 --> 01:16:36.210
with full confidence in yourself,

01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:38.132
sixteen times:

01:16:38.343 --> 01:16:41.599
“Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

01:16:52.448 --> 01:16:56.448
I have already told you that

01:16:57.784 --> 01:17:00.020
to forgive or not to forgive,

01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:02.302
you don’t do anything,

01:17:12.769 --> 01:17:14.278
it is a myth.

01:17:16.162 --> 01:17:20.128
But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:17:27.139 --> 01:17:28.565
So now

01:17:28.926 --> 01:17:31.135
you raise your right hand

01:17:31.335 --> 01:17:33.182
on your forehead

01:17:33.382 --> 01:17:36.100
and put your head down on it

01:17:36.301 --> 01:17:38.299
as far as you can,

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:40.946
and press it on both the sides,

01:17:41.146 --> 01:17:44.215
and here you have to say:

01:17:45.591 --> 01:17:48.821
“Mother, I forgive everyone.”

01:17:49.021 --> 01:17:51.287
Say it from your heart.

01:18:20.655 --> 01:18:22.659
Now take back your hand,

01:18:22.860 --> 01:18:24.059
and push it

01:18:24.259 --> 01:18:26.260
onto the backside of your head

01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:29.784
and put back your head slowly.

01:18:36.637 --> 01:18:38.045
Here now,

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:40.361
without counting your mistakes,

01:18:40.561 --> 01:18:42.236
without feeling guilty,

01:18:42.436 --> 01:18:44.140
for your own satisfaction

01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:46.381
you have to say:

01:18:46.584 --> 01:18:49.380
“Oh Divine, if I have done any mistakes,

01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:51.541
please forgive me.”

01:19:11.946 --> 01:19:15.334
Now stretch your hand fully

01:19:15.608 --> 01:19:18.046
and put your

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:20.607
centre of your palm

01:19:20.807 --> 01:19:23.980
on top of your head, on the fontanel bone area,

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:28.029
which is a soft bone, and put down your head.

01:19:40.217 --> 01:19:43.780
And now you have to move

01:19:45.935 --> 01:19:47.860
your scalp seven times

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:50.580
very slowly, clockwise.

01:20:01.109 --> 01:20:02.871
Put down your head.

01:20:05.699 --> 01:20:09.302
But here again, I cannot force

01:20:09.784 --> 01:20:12.626
on you Self-realisation,

01:20:12.827 --> 01:20:14.871
you have to ask.

01:20:15.652 --> 01:20:18.441
So you have to say while moving your hand:

01:20:18.641 --> 01:20:20.914
“Shri Mataji, please

01:20:21.114 --> 01:20:23.075
give me my Self-realisation.”

01:20:23.275 --> 01:20:24.812
Seven times.

01:20:47.001 --> 01:20:51.001
[Shri Mataji blows through the microphone]

01:21:25.361 --> 01:21:27.630
Take down your hands please.

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:31.651
And open your hands.

01:21:34.498 --> 01:21:38.099
Please put your hands like this. Watch Me without thinking.

01:21:44.831 --> 01:21:46.887
Now bend your head

01:21:47.698 --> 01:21:49.792
and put your left hand

01:21:50.292 --> 01:21:52.385
on top of your head

01:21:52.768 --> 01:21:54.911
on the fontanel bone area,

01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:56.821
and see for yourself if there is a

01:21:57.021 --> 01:21:59.038
cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:21:59.238 --> 01:22:01.583
Or may be some heat, doesn’t matter.

01:22:23.941 --> 01:22:27.698
Now, put the left hand towards me, and put the head down

01:22:27.898 --> 01:22:30.820
and see for yourself if there’s a cool breeze coming

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:33.190
out of your fontanel bone area.

01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:37.022
It may be further on, it could be nearer, it depends on.

01:23:00.145 --> 01:23:04.034
Now put your right hand towards me

01:23:05.006 --> 01:23:07.580
and bend your head again properly,

01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:10.668
and see for yourself if there’s a cool breeze

01:23:10.868 --> 01:23:14.310
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:23:26.008 --> 01:23:28.209
Now, push back your hands

01:23:28.409 --> 01:23:30.957
on top of your head like this,

01:23:31.157 --> 01:23:33.353
and ask a question,

01:23:33.681 --> 01:23:36.251
any one of these three questions:

01:23:37.618 --> 01:23:41.223
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

01:23:41.423 --> 01:23:43.660
“Mother, is this the all-pervading

01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:45.853
power of God’s love?’

01:23:46.053 --> 01:23:48.110
“Mother, is it Paramachaitanya?”

01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:51.263
Ask this question, any one of these, three times.

01:24:12.587 --> 01:24:14.860
Now take down your hands please.

01:24:18.878 --> 01:24:21.917
All those who have felt

01:24:22.175 --> 01:24:24.296
cool breeze in their hands

01:24:24.496 --> 01:24:26.070
or out of their heads

01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:28.630
please raise both your hands.

01:24:41.671 --> 01:24:43.367
Oh, My God.

01:24:43.903 --> 01:24:45.491
May God bless you.

01:24:45.691 --> 01:24:47.164
May God bless you.

01:24:47.987 --> 01:24:50.980
Now know that you have touched

01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:53.671
this all-pervading power.

01:25:00.147 --> 01:25:01.943
Some have not.

01:25:04.185 --> 01:25:05.667
Maybe

01:25:06.073 --> 01:25:08.753
they were doubting themselves.

01:25:11.954 --> 01:25:14.088
Maybe they were not

01:25:14.337 --> 01:25:16.197
physically all right

01:25:16.470 --> 01:25:19.126
or mentally all right.

01:25:24.385 --> 01:25:27.893
Maybe just because they have come only today.

01:25:33.079 --> 01:25:36.241
But all of you can get Realisation.

01:25:39.784 --> 01:25:42.009
It is your right to get it.

01:25:44.441 --> 01:25:47.708
It is the breakthrough of the evolutionary process

01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:54.872
to reach this absolute stage.

01:25:58.215 --> 01:26:00.244
So now I would request you,

01:26:00.444 --> 01:26:01.862
all of you, to come

01:26:02.062 --> 01:26:03.673
to the follow-on programme

01:26:03.873 --> 01:26:05.541
and to the courses

01:26:05.741 --> 01:26:09.134
where you get the knowledge and the love, both,

01:26:09.334 --> 01:26:11.498
to understand yourself.

01:26:28.954 --> 01:26:31.569
In any case, I would like to meet people

01:26:31.769 --> 01:26:34.306
who have got their realisation today.

01:26:40.659 --> 01:26:43.053
And those who haven’t got can come here

01:26:43.253 --> 01:26:45.150
and it can be worked out.

01:27:01.210 --> 01:27:03.983
Just enjoying! Enjoying.
