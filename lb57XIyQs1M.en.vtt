00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:37.368
Today, you all have decided to celebrate My seventy-eighth birthday.

00:02:46.982 --> 00:02:54.178
You have put beautiful balloons as you would put for a child

00:02:55.516 --> 00:03:03.406
on his birthday with such loving hands.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:21.041
Yesterday, as I told you, you have to find out about yourself.

00:03:22.188 --> 00:03:31.516
 Just try to find out also as you love Me, how much you can love others.

00:03:34.114 --> 00:03:46.416
 It will be much easier to find out through introspection

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:57.362
how much you love others and how much you care for others.

00:03:58.744 --> 00:04:07.160
 If that happens, many problems of Sahaja Yoga will be solved in no time.

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:17.124
Even in Sahaja Yoga what I am told that people still are hankering after money.

00:04:17.602 --> 00:04:20.822
They think it's a place where they can make some money.

00:04:21.515 --> 00:04:29.303
I am surprised. This is not the area where you can really work out that.

00:04:30.217 --> 00:04:32.854
You will be exposed in no time.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:42.561
 On the contrary, if you people are worried about your powers in Sahaja Yoga

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:47.459
as leaders and deputy leaders, and I don't know what all,

00:04:47.877 --> 00:04:51.424
 then also you are sadly mistaken.

00:04:52.266 --> 00:04:54.022
That's not the place.

00:04:54.174 --> 00:04:57.319
 For that you can join politics,

00:04:57.672 --> 00:05:02.056
 or else for making money you can go to race courses or some place.

00:05:02.691 --> 00:05:10.306
If you are coming to Sahaja Yoga, what you have to get is a ocean of love

00:05:10.783 --> 00:05:17.163
 within your heart and to seek that in others also.

00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:28.174
It's a love which helps you to do everything so smoothly, so beautifully.

00:05:31.567 --> 00:05:37.105
 As I have always said that if you really love your country,

00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:46.128
you can never be dishonest.
You will have no other interest but to get

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:50.779
your freedom or whatever you want to do for your country.

00:05:52.163 --> 00:05:55.953
In this country, we have had great martyrs.

00:05:56.652 --> 00:06:01.138
Perhaps you may not be knowing, some of you.

00:06:01.578 --> 00:06:07.934
And the way they sustained the torturous life,

00:06:08.085 --> 00:06:12.299
it was only because they loved their country.

00:06:13.624 --> 00:06:16.864
Your country is spirituality.

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:28.221
It is the country of complete enjoyment of yourself.

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.054
It's the country where nothing but peace prevails.

00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:41.792
And, when you love that country, how can you have all these nonsensical ideas

00:06:41.982 --> 00:06:49.507
 for money and for power and all that? I just can't understand.

00:06:52.377 --> 00:07:00.521
I, as it is you know very well, that I'm not bothered about these things at all in my life.

00:07:00.843 --> 00:07:07.650
Of course, we need money for work, for everything.

00:07:07.865 --> 00:07:14.163
But there's no need to run after it or hanker after it.

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:18.885
I am surprised even after so many years of My hard work,

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:26.344
 there are some people still working out some stupid stuffs

00:07:26.891 --> 00:07:33.118
which I can't understand. And, they should know they'll be exposed in no time.

00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:39.601
 This is the year of exposure I told last time. Absolutely!

00:07:39.815 --> 00:07:47.784
If you have no love for Sahaja Yoga,
if you have no love for your Mother,

00:07:47.951 --> 00:07:51.061
you will run after those nonsensical things

00:07:51.133 --> 00:07:56.525
and make some mess out of yourself.
If you want to destroy yourself,

00:07:56.737 --> 00:08:01.187
you can go to some other fields, but not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:01.306 --> 00:08:08.232
In Sahaja Yoga, you have to know you have to be really dedicated and honest.

00:08:08.841 --> 00:08:13.312
 You should enjoy your honesty, you should enjoy your love,

00:08:13.391 --> 00:08:17.386
you should enjoy your generosity, everything.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.290
You will be exposed, no doubt. But then where will you go?

00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:25.480
What will be your position?

00:08:25.866 --> 00:08:33.261
 If you are doing all those things,
you have to go the way people have gone to hell, I should say.

00:08:33.618 --> 00:08:37.102
 Because after coming to the paradise of love,

00:08:37.277 --> 00:08:40.729
 if you are still bothered about these nonsensical things,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.741
then you will jump very fast into the hell. I can see that clearly.

00:08:47.021 --> 00:08:52.622
I shouldn't say this on My birthday, but this is the year of exposure.

00:08:52.908 --> 00:08:55.291
And be very careful!

00:08:55.712 --> 00:09:00.400
Nobody will be spared this year. What to do? Though it's My birthday,

00:09:00.531 --> 00:09:06.038
I have to tell you, it won't keep quiet.

00:09:06.508 --> 00:09:09.618
You know there are certain powers which flow.

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:17.975
And different, different years I find a different type of powers start flowing,

00:09:18.404 --> 00:09:24.584
 and this is the time when power for exposure is going to be there.

00:09:25.459 --> 00:09:32.863
 Whether you are a leader or if you are not, if you are making anything dishonest,

00:09:33.204 --> 00:09:38.449
you will be exposed and you will be rightly punished.

00:09:39.116 --> 00:09:41.687
Sahaja Yoga may not punish you,

00:09:42.012 --> 00:09:47.455
but there are so many ways that this power works out.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:52.689
The first thing is what we call "alakshmi."

00:09:52.871 --> 00:09:59.074
Alakshmi means at that time when you are punished,

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:05.001
you will be surprised, you will just become bankrupt. You will have no money.

00:10:05.252 --> 00:10:08.551
You will be exposed. You may be in jail.

00:10:08.671 --> 00:10:15.369
So, though it's a very auspicious day, I must tell you not to be inauspicious.

00:10:16.179 --> 00:10:20.548
Yesterday's lecture I explained to you: know what your powers are -

00:10:20.906 --> 00:10:28.738
 what you can enjoy, what you can give, what can work out.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:34.134
But firstly, you must know are you capable of doing that

00:10:34.196 --> 00:10:39.002
 or you are just working it out in the other way around.

00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:48.967
 I was amazed to hear that after so many years also people have not given up this kind of a

00:10:50.126 --> 00:10:54.441
temptations that they have and they had.

00:10:57.206 --> 00:11:04.530
On Birthday, you must remember how many years you have spent doing Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:05.818 --> 00:11:10.761
You must understand all the nice time you had

00:11:10.833 --> 00:11:17.142
and how many every year you have spent in enjoying My Birthday -

00:11:17.301 --> 00:11:23.851
 also, in understanding how you have grown into it, how you changed it, and

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:32.413
how you enjoyed and how you have imbibed all the qualities of Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:33.286 --> 00:11:42.901
First and foremost quality of a Sahaja Yogi, that he has to be absolutely honest.

00:11:43.733 --> 00:11:48.799
He has not come here to make money. Not money!

00:11:49.078 --> 00:11:52.740
He has not come here to make a power.

00:11:53.055 --> 00:12:01.334
But he has come to rise into the new beautiful world that we are creating.

00:12:01.682 --> 00:12:04.294
 We have to create this world for the

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:11.845
whole world, for people who live all over, who are even in the jungles,

00:12:12.051 --> 00:12:19.639
who are lost into Himalayas, anywhere

00:12:19.952 --> 00:12:25.549
we have to spread this beautiful sensation,

00:12:25.652 --> 00:12:33.505
 or beautiful existence of self-respect and dignity.

00:12:35.119 --> 00:12:41.332
Very important is to see if you are really the self.

00:12:41.565 --> 00:12:44.692
Are you respecting yourself?

00:12:44.902 --> 00:12:48.817
Yesterday only you said "Know Thyself."

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:53.571
If that is the case, do you respect yourself?

00:12:54.076 --> 00:12:57.985
Very important is first to respect yourself.

00:12:58.438 --> 00:13:00.869
If you don't know how to respect yourself

00:13:01.012 --> 00:13:05.802
and you run after useless things, then what should we say?

00:13:07.056 --> 00:13:12.261
What is the quality that you have imbibed in Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:12.348 --> 00:13:17.165
 except that you have started a business or something like that?

00:13:17.956 --> 00:13:30.841
 It is very sad but there are people
who are still ruined in the mud of all these things.

00:13:32.275 --> 00:13:35.114
You have overcome so many things I know,

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:40.154
you have achieved so many things I know which is not possible.

00:13:40.455 --> 00:13:46.844
 Humanly impossible things you have done - you have got over all this nonsense.

00:13:46.961 --> 00:13:50.686
 But still there are some people among you

00:13:50.781 --> 00:13:56.868
who still are in the stinking mud of nonsense.

00:14:00.408 --> 00:14:08.065
It is nice that you are celebrating My Birthday
with such enthusiasm and such happiness.

00:14:08.343 --> 00:14:10.928
So nice to see all this.

00:14:11.111 --> 00:14:15.711
And, I want you all to be My decorations.

00:14:15.957 --> 00:14:20.062
In the whole world they should see that you are My children,

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:25.956
 and that you are of such great values and such great understanding.

00:14:27.746 --> 00:14:31.504
You are My children.

00:14:32.369 --> 00:14:40.963
I have really worked for you in the sense every minute, moment of My life.

00:14:41.328 --> 00:14:48.386
 I have thought of you. I wanted to work it out in such a beautiful manner

00:14:48.552 --> 00:14:58.039
 that you become really good people, ideal people, special people with understanding.

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:05.797
So, that is the day you should feel that your birthday is being celebrated.

00:15:06.743 --> 00:15:12.046
When you are completely cleared out, you have become Nirmal,

00:15:12.636 --> 00:15:21.070
absolutely pure personality of love,
that's the day is your birthday and Mine too.

00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:24.523
I have to tell about these things

00:15:24.611 --> 00:15:28.230
because some things have come to My notice and I am really shocked

00:15:28.301 --> 00:15:35.737
 the way some people are still not understanding their value,
not understanding their worth.

00:15:35.804 --> 00:15:43.927
 And, that's what other day I told you that you must know about yourself.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:48.147
First of all, the self is the spirit.

00:15:48.846 --> 00:15:52.254
 It's the spirit the reflection of God Almighty.

00:15:52.292 --> 00:15:56.532
If you want to live like all other ordinary nonsensical people,

00:15:56.612 --> 00:15:59.040
you should stay out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:59.714 --> 00:16:07.368
But if you think that you have to really show your worth coming into Sahaja Yoga

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.198
 and if you have to feel proud of yourself,

00:16:11.326 --> 00:16:18.370
then try to understand that in Sahaja Yoga
you don't have to have all these weaknesses.

00:16:19.227 --> 00:16:27.438
 When the Kundalini rises, she passes through
the six chakras by enlightening them.

00:16:28.263 --> 00:16:34.864
 I may tolerate you up to a point but the Kundalini

00:16:35.729 --> 00:16:39.385
will punish you. She will do what is needed to correct you.

00:16:39.505 --> 00:16:42.020
 Up to a point, She will do.

00:16:42.106 --> 00:16:50.959
And, afterwards, when She finds it is not possible to correct you,

00:16:51.332 --> 00:16:56.386
then I don't know what will happen and how it will work out.

00:16:56.681 --> 00:17:03.346
Sahaja Yoga is very easy to come in, to move in and to work it out.

00:17:03.515 --> 00:17:06.875
But you go against yourself.

00:17:07.185 --> 00:17:12.931
 If you try to behave like very ordinary, useless people

00:17:13.103 --> 00:17:18.283
then you cannot stay in Sahaja Yoga.  You'll be thrown out.

00:17:18.597 --> 00:17:22.965
 As soon as you are thrown out, where will you land,

00:17:23.058 --> 00:17:27.256
 what will happen that you know very well.

00:17:31.099 --> 00:17:37.224
On this auspicious day, I have to request you to be auspicious.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.550
Not to do anything that is inauspicious.

00:17:42.133 --> 00:17:47.813
They call it protocol. But there are small, small things

00:17:48.202 --> 00:17:51.495
which shows you are auspicious.

00:17:51.694 --> 00:17:56.523
Very, very minute subtle things that shows

00:17:56.595 --> 00:18:00.468
you're auspicious, which you don't have to learn.

00:18:00.943 --> 00:18:09.668
 Automatically, spontaneously it comes and you enjoy your auspiciousness

00:18:10.392 --> 00:18:16.488
because you are holy, because you are Nirmal

00:18:16.718 --> 00:18:21.458
 and you enjoy that quality within you.

00:18:22.127 --> 00:18:26.377
And, when that happens, that is your birthday.

00:18:27.053 --> 00:18:31.783
You were reborn as you know. All of you were reborn.

00:18:31.934 --> 00:18:37.129
You were reborn but still you were children and now you have grown up.

00:18:37.518 --> 00:18:43.651
 That growth has to be shown in every way.

00:18:43.795 --> 00:18:51.686
When a person grows, then he goes all out to do various things,

00:18:51.771 --> 00:18:57.889
to express himself. In the same way, when you are grown up,

00:18:58.313 --> 00:19:03.943
 then you have to show that you are grown up in Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:04.062 --> 00:19:09.782
 that you are very deep and you are very senior person.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.660
I have seen some little children also.

00:19:12.812 --> 00:19:18.720
They are so grown up and so sensible that sometimes I am amazed.

00:19:18.826 --> 00:19:21.425
 They are great saints reborn.

00:19:22.082 --> 00:19:25.054
 They are great people who are reborn.

00:19:25.157 --> 00:19:29.828
But if you are still running after nonsensical things,

00:19:29.963 --> 00:19:34.191
 if you are still full of lust and greed,

00:19:34.699 --> 00:19:37.791
then better you leave Sahaja Yoga up to itself

00:19:37.901 --> 00:19:43.199
 and you can find some other area where you can do that.

00:19:44.269 --> 00:19:53.659
It is something surprising how people do not understand
 their position in Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:56.739 --> 00:20:02.052
Your growth has been on the whole very good.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.986
I know there are many people who are wonderful Sahaja Yogis,

00:20:07.113 --> 00:20:13.816
 who are really great Sahaja Yogis and they have every right to call themselves

00:20:14.039 --> 00:20:16.958
Sahaja Yogis or Mahayogis.

00:20:17.903 --> 00:20:21.944
But that is only possible and perceptible

00:20:22.262 --> 00:20:30.092
if you really grow up inside

00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:38.898
and your spirit shines like crystal clear ocean of love.

00:20:46.719 --> 00:20:49.785
Now, the connection has been done.

00:20:50.326 --> 00:20:53.772
You have the knowledge of all the chakras.

00:20:54.124 --> 00:20:57.834
You know how to raise Kundalini.

00:20:58.248 --> 00:21:03.065
You know also how to cure people and how to treat people.

00:21:03.998 --> 00:21:12.118
With all that knowledge, with all that life you have got,

00:21:12.891 --> 00:21:20.975
it's like the milk you give to your energies

00:21:21.348 --> 00:21:25.695
and then you have to become energetic.

00:21:26.357 --> 00:21:29.542
You cannot be lethargic about it.

00:21:30.335 --> 00:21:35.236
When you are lethargic, then you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:21:35.931 --> 00:21:42.110
You have to be moving with this flame in your heart

00:21:42.329 --> 00:21:50.976
that you know what is self is and you know what you have to do for others.

00:21:51.429 --> 00:21:56.968
Must be, you must have been also great seekers in previous lives,

00:21:57.326 --> 00:22:03.719
 and that seeking that was there has brought you to Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:04.687 --> 00:22:10.502
 Now, with that seeking when you are here,
 still you are seeking all these useless things.

00:22:10.646 --> 00:22:13.494
They cannot grow, you cannot grow.

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:17.991
And such people cannot make others also grow.

00:22:20.158 --> 00:22:23.636
So, the main thing one has to understand,

00:22:23.892 --> 00:22:27.755
how you have grown in your love.

00:22:27.946 --> 00:22:35.306
You see, a person who is frightful, who is very strict,

00:22:35.844 --> 00:22:42.321
who talks very rudely, is not a Sahaja Yogi, no way.

00:22:42.689 --> 00:22:49.910
But the one who looks after, cares, loves

00:22:50.205 --> 00:22:55.615
and is very generous, is the real Sahaja Yogi.

00:22:56.091 --> 00:22:58.889
 You are people of special qualities

00:22:59.211 --> 00:23:04.121
 and those qualities must be shown in your life.

00:23:04.708 --> 00:23:10.848
I know you love Me very much. And you know what you have done to celebrate My birthday.

00:23:11.341 --> 00:23:15.820
As you have so many of these decorations,

00:23:16.051 --> 00:23:20.205
I have already told you that you are My decorations.

00:23:20.737 --> 00:23:23.576
And, your lives are My decorations,

00:23:23.997 --> 00:23:31.271
and the way you behave and the way you know yourself

00:23:31.678 --> 00:23:38.678
- things will be so much appreciated all over the world.

00:23:39.248 --> 00:23:46.367
It is not for any other purpose but only to remember

00:23:46.683 --> 00:23:50.186
 that you all have to grow.

00:23:50.599 --> 00:23:56.821
 You have to become very, very deep personalities.

00:23:57.075 --> 00:24:04.497
You have to grow within yourself celebrating your own birthday.

00:24:04.649 --> 00:24:10.369
Everyday try to see, what is your experience?

00:24:10.756 --> 00:24:16.169
What did you see? Whom did you meet? How did they talk?

00:24:16.331 --> 00:24:19.492
 I mean I know so many names.

00:24:19.683 --> 00:24:22.119
Practically, everybody's name I know.

00:24:22.303 --> 00:24:25.354
Practically, everybody's Kundalini I know.

00:24:25.512 --> 00:24:31.553
 I also know whose Kundalini is all right, whose is not. I know so many people.

00:24:31.722 --> 00:24:36.118
So many ask Me, "How do You know so many names and how do You remember that?"

00:24:36.293 --> 00:24:43.229
I say, "I don't know that part", but it is that whenever I see a person,

00:24:43.325 --> 00:24:49.671
I see his Kundalini and from that Kundalini I know who he is.

00:24:50.131 --> 00:24:53.771
 There can be thousands and thousands of Kundalinis,

00:24:53.861 --> 00:25:00.127
but I know who is who because I love them.

00:25:00.329 --> 00:25:04.705
If you love somebody, then you know what he is.

00:25:04.832 --> 00:25:09.067
It's not stupid love, as they call it romance and all that.

00:25:09.218 --> 00:25:12.015
 It's very deep feeling.

00:25:12.333 --> 00:25:17.289
When you enter like into the garden of your heart

00:25:17.622 --> 00:25:22.192
and you feel the beautiful fragrance all around -

00:25:22.367 --> 00:25:28.849
when you think of such nice people as there have been as saints,

00:25:29.035 --> 00:25:33.719
 great saviors and now the Sahaja Yogis -

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:46.352
you feel so much grateful that you have achieved
that state of collective enjoyment.

00:25:47.352 --> 00:25:52.318
I have never put any restrictions on you. Do what you like,

00:25:52.441 --> 00:25:56.038
whatever way you want to do it, you can do it. I have never been bothering

00:25:56.151 --> 00:26:04.218
you about money or anything. But that is a testing ground.

00:26:04.805 --> 00:26:09.868
 That is the testing ground where you are standing.

00:26:10.274 --> 00:26:15.620
If you do not test yourself, how will you know how far you have come?

00:26:15.883 --> 00:26:22.456
So, you are the student, you are the examiner,

00:26:22.667 --> 00:26:27.016
 and you are the one who has to give yourself certificate.

00:26:27.294 --> 00:26:33.958
And, in that case what happens is that you start understanding,

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:39.883
 understanding so many things which you have never understood.

00:26:41.449 --> 00:26:45.528
I mean, the knowledge, so called knowledge,

00:26:45.679 --> 00:26:50.372
 is no knowledge because it's all falsehood, it's all mental.

00:26:50.602 --> 00:26:57.115
But the real absolute knowledge dawns upon you about everyone,

00:26:57.417 --> 00:27:07.937
 about every aspect, about every surrounding
that you have, so clearly you know.

00:27:08.586 --> 00:27:16.795
 And, that should happen that you should know very clearly -

00:27:17.096 --> 00:27:24.836
 very, very clearly - what is the situation with you,

00:27:25.129 --> 00:27:29.699
 where are you and what are you doing.

00:27:30.117 --> 00:27:36.398
Not that you have any less powers. You have all the powers,

00:27:36.581 --> 00:27:40.077
but for that you have to go deep down.

00:27:40.189 --> 00:27:45.058
Like there's a well, the well has water in it,

00:27:45.175 --> 00:27:52.175
but if your bucket doesn't go down, how can it bring the water?

00:27:52.653 --> 00:28:01.000
If your bucket is filled with stones, what's the use of that well to you?

00:28:01.314 --> 00:28:07.698
 In the same way, we have everything within us, as I told you yesterday,

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:16.556
and Sahaja Yoga is the way you can go down and find about yourself

00:28:16.708 --> 00:28:23.491
which is so beautiful, clean - and that's the thing to be enjoyed.

00:28:23.658 --> 00:28:28.245
 Not other nonsensical things after which you are running,

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.035
 which you think is important.

00:28:31.169 --> 00:28:37.138
I have already told you: it is "Shudh Ichchaa" is the Kundalini - Shudh Ichchaa,

00:28:37.349 --> 00:28:42.841
pure desire because other desires are never fulfilled.

00:28:43.151 --> 00:28:48.872
You try to buy one thing, then you don't enjoy.

00:28:49.003 --> 00:28:53.788
You want to buy another one, you don't enjoy.
You want to buy another one, you don't enjoy.

00:28:53.883 --> 00:28:57.255
So, because it's not the real desire.

00:28:57.359 --> 00:29:02.255
This is the principle of economics that you are never satisfied.

00:29:02.422 --> 00:29:05.762
You go on buying, buying, buying, buying, buying, buying.

00:29:05.903 --> 00:29:08.997
And you buy so many things ultimately

00:29:09.061 --> 00:29:13.148
what happens is that all the industries collapse.

00:29:13.647 --> 00:29:16.692
That's what is happening in America.

00:29:16.923 --> 00:29:27.121
It has a quality that whatever you do repels back on you.

00:29:28.441 --> 00:29:32.812
Only the spiritual growth does not repel.

00:29:33.479 --> 00:29:38.271
 It flowers, it's fragrant, it's beautiful -

00:29:38.374 --> 00:29:42.624
such a beautiful experience to be with yourself,

00:29:42.862 --> 00:29:49.400
as if you have entered into the beautiful garden of paradise.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:56.267
 If that feeling if you want to have, give up all nonsensical ideas.

00:29:56.505 --> 00:29:58.793
Give up all worldly nonsense.

00:29:59.076 --> 00:30:05.163
 Everything you give up, and then you will feel that you are now

00:30:05.314 --> 00:30:10.160
very much there where you should have been.

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:15.954
 You will have no doubts. You will have no hankerings.

00:30:16.272 --> 00:30:20.385
You will not feel at all in any way dissatisfied.

00:30:20.985 --> 00:30:30.299
 But some people are still at a very elementary stage, I know.

00:30:31.032 --> 00:30:37.461
I know I have not told them because
I know this is the year they'll be all exposed. No doubt!

00:30:39.342 --> 00:30:48.101
Then, what is the use of doing something  in which you will be exposed

00:30:48.426 --> 00:30:55.640
and that the whole world of Sahaja Yoga  will look at you as a criminal?

00:30:55.936 --> 00:31:01.418
 Or as person who doesn't need any respect whatsoever.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:12.227
Either you get out of it - and if you are here to gain lots of

00:31:15.395 --> 00:31:25.821
 ascending steps, you have to have your eyes upward and not downward.

00:31:26.039 --> 00:31:29.023
 You must see what steps there are.

00:31:29.262 --> 00:31:34.800
You have to climb up those steps. With these steps where do you enter? I tell you,

00:31:34.915 --> 00:31:44.245
 in that beautiful garden - fragrant, garden of yourself,  which is so beautiful.

00:31:44.806 --> 00:31:48.346
Instead of that, you are lost in the maya

00:31:48.562 --> 00:31:55.155
 of the world as so many are lost. So, why have you come to Sahaja Yoga?

00:31:56.501 --> 00:31:59.847
Give up those nonsensical ideas.

00:32:00.141 --> 00:32:05.694
Try to take to spirituality. Pure spirituality.

00:32:06.175 --> 00:32:12.071
"Purity" is the world. Purity you must have.

00:32:12.302 --> 00:32:21.700
And, purity within is you can easily, easily establish with Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:22.486 --> 00:32:31.128
 Your witness state has to improve.
Witness state has to be projected so much

00:32:31.453 --> 00:32:38.698
 that this conditioning and ego of reaction will finish up.

00:32:39.019 --> 00:32:43.428
You will have no more reactions, but you will just witness.

00:32:43.579 --> 00:32:50.767
And, the knowledge that is real comes always,  to always through witnessing.

00:32:51.583 --> 00:32:56.396
If you do not know howwitness, then whatever knowledge you have is nothing

00:32:56.499 --> 00:33:03.462
 but through your ego or through your, you can say, conditionings.

00:33:03.783 --> 00:33:05.948
 It's not absolute knowledge.

00:33:06.535 --> 00:33:10.442
So, to get the absolute knowledge about anything,

00:33:10.553 --> 00:33:15.413
what you have to do is to reach the point of absoluteness -

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:25.797
 to reach the point where you are absolutely clean, pure, Nirmal.

00:33:27.097 --> 00:33:31.376
Now, don't condemn yourself if you have some defects.

00:33:31.813 --> 00:33:34.559
There has to be. You are all human beings.

00:33:34.713 --> 00:33:44.458
But all this defects with your power of spirituality you can absolutely overcome.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.939
For that, what have you to do?

00:33:48.136 --> 00:33:53.487
First is introspection. First is trying to find out.

00:33:53.765 --> 00:33:56.325
You separate yourself with yourself

00:33:56.485 --> 00:34:01.638
and say, "Hello Mister, how are you?" Start with that.

00:34:02.238 --> 00:34:05.458
"Hello, what are you up to?"

00:34:06.055 --> 00:34:10.069
And, you start seeing yourself outside

00:34:10.927 --> 00:34:18.334
and eradicating, removing all that is not yourself.

00:34:19.075 --> 00:34:26.075
That knowledge of self comes to you when you want the knowledge.

00:34:27.282 --> 00:34:31.953
 It should be pure desire to know about the self.

00:34:33.102 --> 00:34:39.924
 You are special people, no doubt.
You are all chosen to be very, very special, no doubt.

00:34:40.043 --> 00:34:45.108
 There must be something about you that you have come to this state

00:34:45.167 --> 00:34:51.462
where you are trying to become the self.

00:34:52.216 --> 00:34:56.377
Self is absolutely self-satisfied.

00:34:57.588 --> 00:35:00.728
It does not need anything to satisfy itself.

00:35:00.887 --> 00:35:04.426
Actually, it is satisfaction personified.

00:35:05.024 --> 00:35:14.190
 It just sees things, it just watches things, it just witnesses.

00:35:14.416 --> 00:35:21.725
 And while witnessing anything, it knows. It knows.

00:35:22.090 --> 00:35:26.198
 You don't have to tell: this is this or this is what.

00:35:26.341 --> 00:35:29.111
You don't have to express too much anything.

00:35:29.252 --> 00:35:36.945
 It's just self expressive if, if you are a clean person,

00:35:37.586 --> 00:35:44.406
your desires are clean and that you just have pure desire to ascend.

00:35:44.963 --> 00:35:49.207
So, again I have to talk about Kundalini that you must have

00:35:49.335 --> 00:35:57.514
 a Kundalini completely establishing itself within you.

00:35:59.106 --> 00:36:03.257
 Completely expressing within you.

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:08.602
Completely enlightening, enlightening your self.

00:36:08.979 --> 00:36:17.063
Such a Kundalini should be there,
and only possible if you do not put hurdles in her growth.

00:36:18.031 --> 00:36:22.696
 If you allow it to grow, it grows and it works out.

00:36:23.949 --> 00:36:28.427
As you know, I have started this work only in 1970.

00:36:28.697 --> 00:36:32.218
Not because I could not start it earlier,

00:36:32.599 --> 00:36:37.571
not because there were all bad people in this world,

00:36:37.755 --> 00:36:48.908
but because I was waiting Myself to be deft in dealing with all kinds of Kundalinis.

00:36:49.568 --> 00:36:55.670
 I had to work out all the permutations and combinations that were there.

00:36:55.861 --> 00:37:03.795
And, then I just thought if I could get hold of a way by which

00:37:04.088 --> 00:37:09.538
 all these combinations can be worked out in one line,

00:37:10.147 --> 00:37:15.115
then only Kundalini will rise. And it worked, it happened

00:37:15.488 --> 00:37:21.663
 with a sincere desire! Because I felt very sad about people

00:37:22.182 --> 00:37:28.083
who are spending their lives in something very nonsensical.

00:37:28.203 --> 00:37:33.572
They cannot enjoy anything, they have no genuine feeling for anything,

00:37:33.723 --> 00:37:40.049
 they have no genuine love for anything, and they are not even loved.

00:37:40.327 --> 00:37:45.530
 They cannot love, they are not loved and they are in misery.

00:37:46.824 --> 00:37:54.443
So, it was very deliberate action on My part, I should say,

00:37:54.666 --> 00:37:57.496
 that I watched human beings very carefully.

00:37:58.526 --> 00:38:02.391
 Why they do it like this? Why they behave like this?

00:38:02.534 --> 00:38:06.420
Why are they not understanding? Why are they harsh?

00:38:06.716 --> 00:38:12.162
 Why they shout? Why they beat? Why they do all these things?

00:38:13.092 --> 00:38:15.756
 Because of imbalances within.

00:38:16.788 --> 00:38:21.602
 But with introspection if you start seeing those imbalances,

00:38:21.722 --> 00:38:27.869
 you now know how to cure yourself and you can really work it out.

00:38:27.988 --> 00:38:31.217
You have to just work on your chakras.

00:38:31.607 --> 00:38:35.553
See which chakra is catching, where is the problem.

00:38:35.957 --> 00:38:45.227
 You have to respect yourself in such a way that
you become your own doctor.

00:38:45.598 --> 00:38:48.851
And, you know everything about yourself.

00:38:48.968 --> 00:38:53.459
"Ah, this is wrong with me. Why am I catching?
Why am I catching on that chakra?

00:38:53.642 --> 00:38:58.702
 Why this is happening?" This is the education you have to give it to yourself,

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:05.750
which will be only possible if you experience all those catches.

00:39:06.699 --> 00:39:12.099
It is for you to grow now. Grow into great people,

00:39:12.314 --> 00:39:22.091
 great personalities, very tremendous people
who have made history, who are respected.

00:39:22.647 --> 00:39:30.401
 All those great saints and all that also were of great caliber

00:39:30.461 --> 00:39:35.822
 but they didn't know how to raise the kundalini, which you know.

00:39:36.143 --> 00:39:41.267
You have something special knowledge how to raise the Kundalini,

00:39:41.465 --> 00:39:50.680
how to judge the Kundalini, how to understand where is the problem.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:58.806
 And, also you know how to tell that person about

00:39:59.838 --> 00:40:04.375
his problems, very beautifully with love.

00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:12.637
So, the message of your spirit is that you should love each other.

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:18.482
 If you do not love someone then what's the matter?

00:40:18.799 --> 00:40:25.520
 Why don't you love?
What is the bad thing about a particular person?

00:40:26.078 --> 00:40:31.684
 If he is a Sahaja Yogi and a great Sahaja Yogi, is it out of jealousy?

00:40:31.939 --> 00:40:38.606
 Is it out of greed or is it out lust still you are like that?

00:40:38.932 --> 00:40:51.390
Then the oneness in the whole world of brotherhood is something to be really enjoyed.

00:40:51.798 --> 00:40:55.247
 Enjoyed so beautifully.

00:40:55.695 --> 00:40:58.340
See all these things you have here.

00:40:58.531 --> 00:41:07.006
There is so much harmony among them.
So much of harmony because it is done with love!

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:11.670
 If you do anything with love, it's very harmonious.

00:41:12.242 --> 00:41:15.882
 It creates such harmony among people.

00:41:16.198 --> 00:41:24.865
You see, the enjoyment of each other's company, the enjoyment of each other's achievements

00:41:25.519 --> 00:41:35.582
is so much joy giving that I cannot describe it in words. It's impossible.

00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:41.298
Words cannot communicate to you that feeling that you have.

00:41:41.438 --> 00:41:46.856
As I told you, you feel as if you are in the Garden of Eden.

00:41:48.459 --> 00:41:55.661
That sort of a feeling should come into you when you, your self, you know.

00:41:55.948 --> 00:42:02.796
 Because when you know your self, actually you know your own being

00:42:02.892 --> 00:42:10.724
 and you are so happy that your self is so beautiful.

00:42:11.213 --> 00:42:19.525
 That you are so beautiful, that you are so joyous, that you have all these things -

00:42:20.139 --> 00:42:29.376
to know that within you is really, really very much fragrant with enjoyment.

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:36.140
That state you must have. I see sometimes when you are overjoyed you dance and sing

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.773
and do...that's something really very good.

00:42:39.901 --> 00:42:44.932
But all the time your spirit should dance at smallest things,

00:42:46.644 --> 00:42:53.093
 at the little thing that is made, say, something artistic you see,

00:42:53.388 --> 00:43:03.086
something you see a gesture of kindness, a gesture of gratitude.

00:43:03.497 --> 00:43:12.994
You feel that depth of that feeling.

00:43:13.851 --> 00:43:19.776
For example, today I saw the flag. Independence

00:43:20.107 --> 00:43:23.136
when we got, we made this flag.

00:43:23.329 --> 00:43:30.921
 I had seen this flag been brought down
and put up when the other flag was brought down.

00:43:31.254 --> 00:43:35.728
 I cannot tell you what was the feeling that moment.

00:43:36.378 --> 00:43:43.942
Such a feeling that the truth has somehow or other overcome the untruth.

00:43:44.235 --> 00:43:49.225
 The justice has been shown over the injustice.

00:43:49.609 --> 00:43:54.654
That feeling is still so much, I can't even see the flag.

00:43:54.781 --> 00:43:58.149
 If I see it, I remember the whole history,

00:43:58.377 --> 00:44:03.845
the whole thing - how many people sacrificed,
how many martyrs there were,

00:44:03.997 --> 00:44:09.627
and how much people have fought for it. That flag stands for that.

00:44:10.596 --> 00:44:17.596
And, you stand for all that. You stand for all those ideals.

00:44:18.472 --> 00:44:21.784
You stand for all those sacrifices.

00:44:22.046 --> 00:44:30.141
 And, you stand for all that is to be achieved for bettering human beings.

00:44:30.515 --> 00:44:36.466
You have to achieve a great deal for others.

00:44:36.792 --> 00:44:43.592
You have to work within yourself what you can do for others,

00:44:44.132 --> 00:44:51.296
 what you can achieve for others, what is the best way to imbibe

00:44:51.468 --> 00:44:58.468
those qualities within you that you become a absolutely unique personality.

00:44:59.168 --> 00:45:02.331
As I told you, there have been many great leaders

00:45:02.426 --> 00:45:08.418
and many great people who are remembered by many people.

00:45:08.981 --> 00:45:13.258
 Now, what you should see what made them so great?

00:45:13.946 --> 00:45:18.009
Why so many years people still remember?

00:45:18.492 --> 00:45:22.098
 I have given you the statue of Shivaji Maharaj.

00:45:22.257 --> 00:45:30.373
Now, he was another soul, a great soul who had such principles,

00:45:30.704 --> 00:45:38.593
 and such beautifying life in his language, in his attitude and everything.

00:45:38.919 --> 00:45:42.093
 With all that, he was a very brave person.

00:45:42.808 --> 00:45:49.808
Once you have this, you will not deter from doing anything that is important.

00:45:50.436 --> 00:45:53.133
 You will have no fear of anything.

00:45:53.261 --> 00:46:00.661
You will not go round and round but you will know
how to find the solution and how to work it out.

00:46:01.777 --> 00:46:08.297
 This will happen to you if you really know yourself,

00:46:08.578 --> 00:46:14.914
you will have such powers of courage.

00:46:15.421 --> 00:46:19.158
 You will not be dare devil, but with wisdom.

00:46:19.526 --> 00:46:22.763
 Courage with wisdom you will have.

00:46:23.646 --> 00:46:31.695
 And, that is what is your self
which will give you lots of wisdom and lots of courage.

00:46:33.707 --> 00:46:40.379
 It's not a fighting spirit, it's not a violent nature, it's not rude nature,

00:46:40.512 --> 00:46:46.244
but it's a very silent beautiful, courageous attitude.

00:46:46.572 --> 00:46:50.543
There is a story about one Chinese saint.

00:46:56.098 --> 00:47:03.380
That when this Chinese saint was asked by one king

00:47:04.562 --> 00:47:11.832
 that he should teach how to fight to his cocks.
They were having cock fights.

00:47:13.971 --> 00:47:20.971
The Chinese saint said, "All right, bring your cock here.
I will teach you how to fight."

00:47:22.425 --> 00:47:31.258
And, the Chinese saint must have put some wisdom
 into the head of a cock. Can you imagine?

00:47:32.157 --> 00:47:40.935
And, when they took them for that fight,
 what they found that cock was just standing.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:46.951
 It would not attack, it would not retreat, it would just stand.

00:47:47.332 --> 00:47:53.259
And, all the cocks ran away from the field

00:47:54.219 --> 00:48:03.030
because in that standing was the power of wisdom and power of courage.

00:48:03.701 --> 00:48:10.142
Courage is silently very powerful.

00:48:12.064 --> 00:48:15.965
You don't have to bomb anybody, don't have to kill anybody,

00:48:16.308 --> 00:48:19.431
but you have to stand up with courage.

00:48:19.534 --> 00:48:28.091
And, that is the another quality which will express,
which is very polite, very sweet.

00:48:28.901 --> 00:48:33.041
 You will be standing with that courage.

00:48:33.764 --> 00:48:36.827
I know so many of you are like that.

00:48:37.294 --> 00:48:44.477
 There's no struggle, there's no fight, just standing with courage

00:48:45.110 --> 00:48:48.105
and doing whatever is right.

00:48:48.312 --> 00:48:55.911
And, that is quite possible because you have
now the connection with the Almighty.

00:48:56.394 --> 00:48:59.952
 You have the connection with the Paramachaitanya

00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:03.500
and that will work it out, everything.

00:49:03.692 --> 00:49:13.777
I'll be very, very happy to say that today
 I'm seeing so many of you are such good Sahaja Yogis.

00:49:14.131 --> 00:49:21.453
 So many of them! And, if you find anyone who is not, please report it to Me.

00:49:22.194 --> 00:49:23.979
Please tell Me.

00:49:24.465 --> 00:49:30.258
 Please find out if there is anyone who is trying to be very oppressive

00:49:30.412 --> 00:49:34.612
and who is trying to control everything, who is trying to make money,

00:49:34.689 --> 00:49:38.117
who is trying to have lust and greed being expressed.

00:49:38.414 --> 00:49:47.307
So, once you have really worked out you should know

00:49:47.601 --> 00:49:56.243
this is the area what we call is Dharmayudha.

00:49:57.696 --> 00:50:03.746
Dharmayudha means the war of religion,

00:50:04.096 --> 00:50:07.087
but not the way people are fighting it.

00:50:07.605 --> 00:50:12.748
Our dharmayudha is that we are standing on dharma,

00:50:12.899 --> 00:50:19.309
and dharma means not religion but it is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:50:20.089 --> 00:50:28.586
We are standing on our religion and there's a negativity, we can call it adharma,

00:50:29.489 --> 00:50:34.065
which is fighting so you stand on your dharma.

00:50:34.296 --> 00:50:44.276
Unless and until you are dharmic you cannot have any achievement in Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:45.831 --> 00:50:51.839
I have seen people who are say, abroad,

00:50:52.068 --> 00:50:55.506
 they have funny ideas and they will come and tell me,

00:50:55.629 --> 00:51:00.174
"Mother, see, I have a wife but I'm in love with another woman.

00:51:00.355 --> 00:51:01.851
So, what should I do?"

00:51:02.034 --> 00:51:06.732
I said, "You get out. That's all. Just get out."

00:51:07.144 --> 00:51:09.843
Or he may say, the wife might say

00:51:09.922 --> 00:51:13.994
that, "Mother, see, I'm having relations with another man.

00:51:14.129 --> 00:51:15.950
And, what should I do?"

00:51:16.176 --> 00:51:20.955
I said, "You get out. That's all. You get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:21.254 --> 00:51:26.411
You are no good for Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja Yoga is no good for you."

00:51:26.991 --> 00:51:32.356
Is a complete outcast!

00:51:33.198 --> 00:51:37.867
They have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:57.008
Also, in India we have problem of dishonesty.

00:51:58.358 --> 00:52:01.117
 They are dishonest people.

00:52:01.212 --> 00:52:05.098
 This is our special temperament, I think.

00:52:05.169 --> 00:52:10.492
 We have very corrupt people. India has become so corrupt that

00:52:10.767 --> 00:52:15.368
 I can't believe it. I was here about thirty-five years back,

00:52:15.471 --> 00:52:18.516
we had never heard of corruption.

00:52:19.041 --> 00:52:22.616
Now, they have become so corrupt

00:52:22.934 --> 00:52:30.029
and that's what enters, that also enters into Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:30.871 --> 00:52:34.686
When that enters into Sahaja Yoga,

00:52:35.321 --> 00:52:39.475
they will be just found out

00:52:39.772 --> 00:52:43.414
and will be punished not by Me,

00:52:43.468 --> 00:52:46.974
by you, but their own Kundalini.

00:52:52.044 --> 00:52:59.714
So, every country has its own specialty as far as doing something wrong.

00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:03.286
 We are not here to do anything wrong.

00:53:03.509 --> 00:53:08.685
 We are not going to express ourselves as wrong people.

00:53:08.868 --> 00:53:15.658
But we are here to prove that we are perfect, we are wonderful people.

00:53:16.024 --> 00:53:20.334
That is what is the self - that we are perfect.

00:53:20.813 --> 00:53:29.586
 We don't have to go according to what we were.

00:53:30.272 --> 00:53:36.796
It's a new realm we have reached, it's a new area we have reached,

00:53:37.026 --> 00:53:41.465
and let us enjoy that great area.

00:53:42.294 --> 00:53:45.385
I think all of you understand Me

00:53:45.473 --> 00:53:55.040
 that today I am little worried about people
who are dragging Sahaja Yoga down.

00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:02.461
 And, they should understand that I understand everything.

00:54:02.809 --> 00:54:08.281
And, when they'll be harmed, they should not blame Me for that.

00:54:08.726 --> 00:54:15.126
It is obvious that they are nowhere near Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:16.091 --> 00:54:20.548
 Sahaja Yoga purifies you everyday.

00:54:21.065 --> 00:54:25.625
You see one experience, you see one person,

00:54:25.709 --> 00:54:32.035
you see some events and it purifies you.

00:54:33.468 --> 00:54:35.166
That's the sign.

00:54:35.344 --> 00:54:39.402
Supposing I see somebody - a dishonest man,

00:54:39.539 --> 00:54:46.980
 immediately I start finding "I hope I'm not doing any dishonesty Myself."

00:54:48.504 --> 00:54:55.222
Just imagine that you are the one who is the curator -

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:58.750
 correcting influence on yourself.

00:54:59.219 --> 00:55:01.925
Where do you stand? Do you stand

00:55:02.107 --> 00:55:07.741
 on the correction point or in getting finished with it?

00:55:08.293 --> 00:55:11.541
Yesterdays lecture everybody liked very much

00:55:11.652 --> 00:55:15.564
but this is the extension of that lecture, I'm telling you.

00:55:15.778 --> 00:55:20.119
That you are very great people. You can save the whole world.

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:26.387
I must say I never expected all this to happen in My lifetime.

00:55:26.688 --> 00:55:32.797
And it has happened. And, I see you as very great, very great people.

00:55:33.271 --> 00:55:36.900
 Especially ladies have to work it out more

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:46.034
because I am a woman, and women have a special capacity to love and to bear.

00:55:47.582 --> 00:55:52.543
I expect all of you to become beautiful, beautiful Sahaja Yogis.

00:55:52.702 --> 00:55:56.339
And that nothing can convince the whole world

00:55:56.567 --> 00:56:07.213
 but your work, your abilities, and also your power to love.

00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:15.948
So many things I have seen, experienced about you people.

00:56:16.222 --> 00:56:20.795
 When I think about them I really feel very happy.

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:25.779
I have seen people how they have managed and looked after

00:56:26.017 --> 00:56:30.890
so many things which were difficult, and have worked it out.

00:56:31.151 --> 00:56:34.495
So, now we are in for a new world

00:56:34.583 --> 00:56:40.940
and in that new world, a new race of Sahaja Yogis  have to show their presence.

00:56:41.122 --> 00:56:47.123
 They have to show their powers and their courage and their understanding.

00:56:47.319 --> 00:56:55.329
It is not serious. It is not frivolous. But it is joyous.

00:56:55.814 --> 00:57:02.091
 It is just joy that you have to feel about yourself.

00:57:02.274 --> 00:57:08.360
 I am telling you all this
because this is within you,  within your power.

00:57:08.466 --> 00:57:14.969
 It is all the time residing within you and that you have faced it also.

00:57:15.444 --> 00:57:19.945
So, I wish you all a very, very happy birthday

00:57:20.052 --> 00:57:30.493
 so that you people have a new birth
and new understanding and a new personality.

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:34.739
 Try to accept that personality, try to respect it.

00:57:34.965 --> 00:57:38.175
That's the personality is your self.

00:57:38.338 --> 00:57:41.151
May God bless you!
