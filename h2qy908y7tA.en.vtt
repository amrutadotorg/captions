00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:15.730
[Music]

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:20.270
[Applause]

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:26.619
this pure spirit within us is the

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.619
reflection of God Almighty Sadashiva

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:46.429
it's like the Sun that falls in the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:52.309
water and gives a clear reflection or

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:57.140
else it falls on the stone it doesn't

00:00:52.309 --> 00:01:01.850
give any reflection at all if you have

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:09.560
say the mirror the Sun will not only

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:15.230
fall on the mirror but will reflect back

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:22.220
its light in the same way in the human

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:28.899
beings the reflection of God Almighty is

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:33.110
expressed in a way your personality is

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:38.060
if your personality is clean and clear

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:41.079
innocent then that reflection could be

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.079
like a mirror

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:52.939
thus the saintly people they reflect God

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:57.170
Almighty in the proper manner in the

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:02.509
sense that their own identification with

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:07.880
wrong things is no more when there is no

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:13.700
such identification and when a person is

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:19.000
absolutely the pure spirit then the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:24.099
reflection of God reflects into us

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.140
luckily you all have got your

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:31.099
self-realization that means the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:35.030
reflection of God my Almighty is already

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:43.579
working into your attention the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:53.150
attention is enlightened by the power of

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:59.810
the Spirit so when you are in sahaja

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:03.919
yoga you have cleansed out yourself your

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:09.010
Kundalini has also cleansed and now you

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:14.049
have pure personalities that's why this

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:18.799
reflection is clearer and clearer and

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:22.699
people see it see it on your face see it

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:28.419
in your body they see it in your work in

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:33.079
your behavior in everywhere it is

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:37.069
difficult for people to really believe

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:40.729
in themselves that they could be the

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:45.169
reflection of God Almighty they have

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:47.959
some sort of a complexes about

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:52.099
themselves I think that they cannot

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:57.579
understand how they have suddenly become

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.579
the reflection of God Almighty

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:10.880
but they have a capacity and they can

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:13.890
become the reflection of God Almighty

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:17.459
for which they have to have faith in

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:21.320
themselves faith in their ascent to

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:24.920
believe that we have become that you

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:28.170
must have confidence in sahaja yoga and

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.260
confidence in yourself that you are on

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:35.550
the right path and that you are now

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.740
saved and nobody can attack you because

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.870
you have the complete protection of the

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:48.030
divine with the proper understanding

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:51.000
that you are the pure spirit if you

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:55.260
believe in that then you will be

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.160
surprised that you will be very

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.460
confident about what you are doing we

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:06.920
have now sahaja Yogi's all over but what

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:10.850
I find among sahaja Yogi's is this that

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:15.800
some of the sahaja Yogi's grow very fast

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:19.440
steadily strongly they achieve their

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:22.740
principle of Shiva that the first

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:28.320
achievement shows that from inside they

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:31.380
start getting detached now detachment is

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:35.370
not mental it's not mental it is not

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:38.820
that we have to take to some sort of a

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.430
sannyasa or you have to go to Himalayas

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:45.960
give up our families and all that but

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:50.250
the detachment is within oneself when

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:55.560
that detachment starts working the first

00:05:50.250 --> 00:06:01.080
sign is that we become Joy's we become

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:01.700
happy now if you ask anyone why are you

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.240
unhappy

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:11.490
he'll talk about this why maybe his

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:16.250
house maybe his children maybe

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:22.680
his country maybe society whatever it is

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:25.380
so he gets absolutely upset or maybe

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:31.490
very unhappy to see things happening

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:36.230
around him now he is a realized soul

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:40.800
this unhappiness is not going to help

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:45.900
what is needed is now to know that you

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:49.680
can correct all these eats of the

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:54.570
society of the family of the whole

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:58.080
country by transforming others not by

00:06:54.570 --> 00:07:00.270
feeling bad but while doing that the

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.130
main thing that you should have is a

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:08.180
complete detachment now how to achieve

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:12.750
detachment is the point to understand

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:16.860
yourself you should introspect try to

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:20.610
find out - what thing am i attached why

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:23.280
am i miserable for whom am I worried why

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:26.190
should I worry you should discover about

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:29.280
yourself what's wrong with you which

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:32.280
side is catching is it right or left

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.950
side it's meditation you can find out

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.770
are you attached to money are you

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:41.010
attached to business are you attached to

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:48.660
your family are you attached to your

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:51.930
country in a way which is not such or to

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:57.030
your culture which is not such then try

00:07:51.930 --> 00:08:00.570
to get rid of this attachment by

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:03.930
meditation this attachment will show on

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:07.050
your fingertips and you have to see for

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:11.160
yourself what centers you are catching

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:16.080
in which way are you in problem and then

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:19.230
you can clarify it very simply by taking

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:23.670
a very simple search treatment

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:27.030
I think here we fail that once we get

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:29.190
attached to something we don't even

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:31.350
think we are getting in time you think

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:34.770
we're doing very great thing because now

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:39.060
we love this person love that person she

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:41.430
was qualities the compassion part that

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:44.370
is no compassion of any kind to be

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:47.310
attached to any such things is no

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:53.780
compassion in you cannot have compassion

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:58.680
of Shiva because that compassion is very

00:08:53.780 --> 00:09:00.780
few it is like as I have told you many

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:05.820
times it's like the SAP in the tree

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:08.670
which rises and goes to various parts of

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:11.280
this tree and then either it's

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:14.700
evaporates or goes down into mother

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:18.090
earth it's not attached if it gets

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:23.730
attached to one flower or to one leaf or

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:26.880
to one fruit then the whole tree will

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:30.420
suffer and also the flower will

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.650
discipline in meditating on your heart

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.980
on the Shiva tattva

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:37.800
the principle of Shiva you can

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:42.570
definitely detach and then the joy will

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:44.850
be the maximum you can have interest you

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:47.610
should have interest but in that

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:51.540
interest there should be enlightenment

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:54.750
that you cannot get attached what you

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:57.540
know is much higher much greater and

00:09:54.750 --> 00:10:00.390
much more joy giving now these

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:03.660
attachments people think that is very

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:07.230
joy-giving it's a very wrong idea the

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:10.170
joy comes from your own source of your

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:13.080
spirit whether your husband is good

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:16.860
whether your children are good or bad

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:20.130
whatever they are they cannot give you

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:24.720
John it's only you can enjoy yourself

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:27.000
and this is why one becomes very

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.820
forgiving

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.090
when nobody can harm you then whom are

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:37.030
you going to be angry with that is

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:39.940
another great quality of Sadashiva is

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:40.810
that is extremely forgiving he goes up

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:43.720
to a point

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:47.470
till he destroys the whole work of

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:51.730
auditioning but otherwise he's very very

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:56.820
forgiving and he also is very balanced

00:10:51.730 --> 00:11:02.760
about it what I find that in the whole

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:11.590
atmosphere of today in the modern times

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:14.760
there's a big struggle going on which is

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:21.010
not she was culture

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:25.810
she was culture is they I should say the

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:33.480
Sahaj culture if you are sahaja Yogi's

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:39.700
if you have compassionate understanding

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:43.510
of others feelings and also you should

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:47.680
have readiness to look after not only

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:50.460
sahaja Yogi's also non sahaja yoga then

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.930
your compassion will become effective

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:56.830
you should have also collective

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:59.940
meditation in your ashrams

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:03.160
will be a good idea if you can try

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.240
collective meditation will be nice but

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:08.110
you don't have to give vibrations

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:10.030
training you don't have to look after

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:12.790
the chakras of others you just bother

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:16.270
yourself what's wrong with you and now

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:20.910
whatever is the solution for your ascent

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:24.700
if you put because the responsibility of

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:27.840
the whole world rests on sahaja Yogi's

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:31.510
this you know that there's no way out

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:36.220
without sahaja yoga to save humanity

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:38.360
from all kinds of problems sahaja yoga

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:40.639
has come on this earth

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:45.230
so it is your responsibility to keep

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:47.660
yourself in proper shape as far as

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:51.639
sahaja Yoga is concerned get rid of your

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:55.910
left and get rid of your right and then

00:12:51.639 --> 00:12:58.429
to spread sahaja yoga not by bombastic

00:12:55.910 --> 00:13:02.420
words or aggressiveness but with love

00:12:58.429 --> 00:13:05.059
and compassion I am sure we have done a

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:08.629
lot we have achieved a lot but there are

00:13:05.059 --> 00:13:11.569
still some points here and there which

00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:14.749
is a very unpleasant task for me to

00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:19.309
correct them or whatever it is I have to

00:13:14.749 --> 00:13:22.970
say that is working and everybody should

00:13:19.309 --> 00:13:25.519
look at themselves and feel happy from

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:29.529
where they have come here and how far we

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:29.529
have to may God bless you

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.430
Oh
