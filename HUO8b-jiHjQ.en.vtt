00:02.010 --> 00:05.010
Shri Mataji, what is Sahaja Yoga?

00:05.950 --> 00:07.260
Sahaja.

00:07.300 --> 00:09.040
Sahaja. Saha means ‘with’

00:09.120 --> 00:11.886
Ja means ‘born’.

00:11.926 --> 00:15.446
So it is born with you.’ The right’

00:15.466 --> 00:20.882
to become ‘united,’ which is the yoga with the Divine.

00:20.882 --> 00:25.367
And this Sahaja Yoga is something that everybody can have, is it?

00:25.382 --> 00:27.837
Is it something, everybody can practice?

00:27.832 --> 00:29.547
Of course.

00:29.552 --> 00:36.460
And how does this connection with the Divine take place?

00:36.510 --> 00:40.645
We have within ourselves this power in the triangular bone

00:40.668 --> 00:44.135
which is called a ‘Sacrum’ meaning sacred,

00:44.148 --> 00:48.724
which when awakened sprouts like a plumule in a seed

00:48.738 --> 00:52.814
and rises through six subtle centres,

00:52.823 --> 00:56.963
opens out in the last centre

00:57.013 --> 01:01.133
and gets connected with the Divine,

01:01.173 --> 01:04.900
which is subtle energy, all around us,

01:04.950 --> 01:07.370
which organises us,

01:07.380 --> 01:10.460
which nourishes us, does all the living work.

01:10.520 --> 01:13.800
Above all it loves us.

01:13.809 --> 01:19.259
Does this mean Shri Mataji, that people who have not

01:19.289 --> 01:23.884
had the ability to practice Sahaja Yoga are not connected with the Divine?

01:23.913 --> 01:25.993
Most of them are not.

01:25.983 --> 01:29.825
And if some of them are, they don’t know all about it.

01:29.853 --> 01:31.844
So this is what,

01:31.861 --> 01:37.081
an extra force that is available to human beings to develop themselves in this world?

01:37.091 --> 01:38.046
Of course

01:38.051 --> 01:41.366
This is the last breakthrough of our evolution,

01:41.376 --> 01:44.265
where you have to get connected with the Divine.

01:44.276 --> 01:47.270
You have to feel it on your central nervous system

01:47.286 --> 01:50.359
and that’s how you get Self-realization.

01:52.329 --> 01:57.718
Do I perceive here that this is a way of balancing oneself?

01:57.768 --> 02:03.464
Of keeping in such a way of living one’s life,

02:03.554 --> 02:08.094
that one is not unbalanced in one’s view of what is going on around us?

02:08.154 --> 02:12.702
Yes. We have two sides in our system of the autonomous nervous system,

02:12.782 --> 02:13.988
left and right,

02:14.032 --> 02:17.457
which we call as left and right sympathetic nervous system.

02:17.482 --> 02:23.938
Left side caters for our emotions,

02:24.011 --> 02:27.001
for our past, our desires.

02:27.041 --> 02:31.468
The right side caters for our action,

02:31.514 --> 02:33.727
physical and mental.

02:33.744 --> 02:37.604
If you indulge in one too much and go too far with it,

02:37.664 --> 02:41.582
you develop an imbalance within yourself.

02:41.602 --> 02:46.966
In the centre lies the third power which we call as parasympathetic nervous system.

02:46.986 --> 02:50.696
This is the channel which is the central path of ascent.

02:50.736 --> 02:52.940
When the kundalini rises through it,

02:52.976 --> 02:55.610
it brings you in the balance

02:55.648 --> 03:00.358
because it rises in the centre of the system.

03:00.388 --> 03:04.947
So this is the minimum that happens, that you develop your balance.

03:04.977 --> 03:09.937
So how does one actually achieve this balance?

03:09.986 --> 03:13.786
It just happens spontaneously.

03:13.836 --> 03:17.815
In other words, there is no physical requirement on an individual?

03:17.825 --> 03:20.515
Not at all. Not at all.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.365
It’s an evolutionary step. As I told you

03:23.425 --> 03:28.295
in our evolution, we have developed a balance, we can stand on our two legs.

03:28.315 --> 03:29.955
Animals cannot.

03:29.961 --> 03:38.001
In the same way, you develop this special balance between your emotions and your actions

03:38.061 --> 03:41.171
in a very proper way.

03:41.201 --> 03:45.461
You speak as though this is some sort of evolutionary step.

03:45.491 --> 03:46.531
Yes it is.

03:46.581 --> 03:48.694
It is the last breakthrough,

03:48.711 --> 03:51.044
that you have to become the Spirit now

03:51.051 --> 03:53.911
and this has to be achieved,

03:53.921 --> 03:56.864
which can be achieved only through a living process

03:56.872 --> 04:00.631
because we have become human beings through a living process

04:00.651 --> 04:04.452
and that living process has to act within us.

04:04.497 --> 04:10.067
This sounds as though it is rather a significant time than in the history of humanity?

04:10.127 --> 04:10.967
Very much.

04:10.977 --> 04:12.485
In the history of humanity,

04:12.547 --> 04:14.437
in the history of evolution,

04:14.517 --> 04:16.620
in the history of spirituality,

04:16.664 --> 04:18.670
it is the most important time

04:18.740 --> 04:24.819
because here, where you will get whatever has been promised to you so far.

04:24.870 --> 04:30.836
So it is no accident then that Sahaja Yoga has appeared in the world at this time?

04:30.871 --> 04:33.036
No, not at all, not at all.

04:33.071 --> 04:35.816
It is all predicted thousands of years back in India

04:35.851 --> 04:37.681
and later on by many Saints.

04:37.761 --> 04:41.121
Even William Blake has predicted it.

04:41.121 --> 04:48.830
Shri Mataji you went to Russia last year and I believe the reception you got was most surprising?

04:48.860 --> 04:49.540
Yes.

04:52.560 --> 04:53.950
I was myself surprised

04:54.000 --> 04:56.253
because thousands of people came

04:56.313 --> 05:00.990
and very sensible well-educated people came

05:00.998 --> 05:03.618
and they all settled down. Thousands.

05:03.598 --> 05:08.598
I did not know how to cope with that number because there were so many,

05:08.608 --> 05:15.197
and even the members of the supreme council, the government, they came.

05:15.277 --> 05:23.545
but I could only say that in the so-called free societies

05:23.577 --> 05:27.538
we waste too much time experimenting with our freedom

05:27.535 --> 05:32.588
and indulge too much into politics which is a waste thing, I think,

05:32.609 --> 05:35.389
then the economics, all these things.

05:35.439 --> 05:38.729
While the people there did not have any such chances.

05:38.779 --> 05:43.691
So they put their energies to something that was higher than that.

05:43.781 --> 05:46.349
They diverted and they were very knowledgeable,

05:46.361 --> 05:48.849
they knew a lot about seeking.

05:48.871 --> 05:54.119
They knew a lot about Kundalini and as if they were just waiting for me.

05:54.119 --> 05:56.779
It was very remarkable.

05:56.839 --> 06:01.990
Mr Gorbachev has said the Russians require a mental revolution.

06:02.020 --> 06:06.139
Do you see the acceptance of Sahaja yoga as part of this revolution?

06:06.219 --> 06:09.046
Of course. He himself is a saint

06:09.049 --> 06:11.946
and what he is meaning by ‘mental’, that

06:11.965 --> 06:17.176
they should now understand that they have to develop that balance

06:17.176 --> 06:20.691
between communism and democracy.

06:20.701 --> 06:23.011
Our democracies are imbalanced.

06:23.011 --> 06:24.361
They are one-sided.

06:24.381 --> 06:27.458
They have no.. not the other side of collectivity

06:27.481 --> 06:29.868
but communism has collectivity.

06:29.878 --> 06:31.906
It is power-oriented.

06:31.908 --> 06:37.890
Our democracies are money-oriented.

06:37.886 --> 06:43.062
What he is meaning is the maturity of our wisdom

06:43.086 --> 06:47.091
So referring back to what we were talking about earlier,

06:47.302 --> 06:49.115
is it...?

06:55.017 --> 06:58.543
As we were talking about earlier, about bringing the human body into balance?

06:58.603 --> 07:04.547
Could we say then that Mr Gorbachev is bringing the whole eastern Bloc into balance?

07:04.547 --> 07:06.317
Yes.

07:06.327 --> 07:15.317
Yes, they had gone too much on one side and he is trying to bring them in the centre.

07:17.993 --> 07:23.790
You mentioned that you went to an eastern bloc conference last year

07:23.793 --> 07:29.690
and I believe you gave many influential people, Realisation?

07:29.710 --> 07:35.300
Is it true that you believe that this was instrumental in helping the overthrow of oppressive communism?

07:35.320 --> 07:38.410
It was a yoga, yoga seminar

07:38.430 --> 07:41.687
and I expected all of them to be there

07:41.730 --> 07:46.082
and surprisingly I talked to them hardly for 30 to 35 minutes

07:46.152 --> 07:49.582
and then I gave them realisation and all of them got it.

07:49.602 --> 07:54.122
They were representatives from all these Eastern Bloc Countries.

07:54.172 --> 07:57.376
When they got it they were so surprised at it,

07:57.446 --> 08:00.646
then they walked out with me out of the hall

08:00.666 --> 08:03.946
and nobody was left in the hall to listen to other people.

08:04.016 --> 08:08.483
They gave me their addresses and they said we want ‘this only’, in our country

08:08.485 --> 08:13.155
and they wanted to start centres and I am told they have already started centres.

08:15.995 --> 08:21.247
The all-pervading power requires a medium, to trigger something

08:21.277 --> 08:24.850
and when these people were created as Realised souls,

08:24.920 --> 08:28.800
as they got connected with this ‘ all-pervading power’,

08:28.802 --> 08:30.220
I think they had triggered it.

08:30.242 --> 08:33.070
They had that confidence within them,

08:33.082 --> 08:35.400
that courage in them

08:35.432 --> 08:38.568
because once we are realised, you become very courageous

08:38.564 --> 08:42.334
and you want to establish truth at any cost.

08:43.364 --> 08:46.954
Shri Mataji the West, shall we call it the Western Nations

08:47.024 --> 08:52.494
have had Sahaja Yoga available to them to investigate

08:52.521 --> 08:57.771
to see for themselves how it worked for 20 years

08:57.841 --> 08:59.942
and yet it has been very slow to grow.

08:59.971 --> 09:02.784
Why has it happened this way, do you think?

09:05.172 --> 09:09.998
Here people have so many diverse ideas about things.

09:09.992 --> 09:15.458
They're very self-opinionated also about things

09:15.470 --> 09:19.410
and the so called man made religions all over

09:19.420 --> 09:21.990
have also conditioned them too much.

09:22.060 --> 09:25.650
They've other conditioning of different norms that they have

09:25.740 --> 09:30.125
as far as the social life is concerned

09:30.205 --> 09:37.314
and the physical appearances rather on a very superficial level.

09:37.315 --> 09:40.499
So the people have not grown, I think so, much deeper.

09:40.509 --> 09:44.109
Of course, I must say there are so many seekers in the west,

09:44.119 --> 09:46.166
So many seekers

09:46.199 --> 09:55.768
and they were lost because as soon as people knew that there’s a market for them,

09:55.768 --> 09:57.967
the false gurus jumped out

09:57.994 --> 10:01.154
and they started preaching about false things

10:01.174 --> 10:03.067
just to earn money.

10:03.097 --> 10:05.234
They were all money-oriented people,

10:05.294 --> 10:08.584
Now there’s another psychology with the western mind

10:08.598 --> 10:11.188
that you must buy everything.

10:11.238 --> 10:14.718
If something is not for sale, then it is useless

10:14.788 --> 10:20.357
and this psychology has really deterred them to come to Sahaja Yoga very much

10:20.367 --> 10:23.527
because this is a living process and you cannot pay for it

10:23.538 --> 10:24.968
and they could not bear it.

10:24.997 --> 10:26.514
I mean, actually, I must say,

10:26.547 --> 10:31.974
one of the very important television gentlemen told me off

10:31.951 --> 10:37.591
that Anglo Saxon brain cannot accept anything which cannot be sold.

10:39.291 --> 10:41.301
I did not know what to tell him.

10:41.351 --> 10:43.988
I just said,’ Who has made this brain?

10:43.980 --> 10:47.368
This God has made. Then why is it so?’

10:47.370 --> 10:53.500
So You have an expectation really that this thing called Sahaja Yoga will change the world?

10:53.550 --> 10:54.923
Of course.

10:54.910 --> 10:58.660
It changes human beings and they manifest a change outside.

10:58.660 --> 11:00.306
And we create a new race.

11:00.290 --> 11:02.220
That is what they are talking about.

11:02.270 --> 11:05.420
If you want they talk of a new age, of a new race

11:05.540 --> 11:08.245
but I don’t know what is their imagination about it.

11:08.305 --> 11:10.125
They talk about all this thing, ‘Aquarius.’

11:10.185 --> 11:11.765
And Aquarius is the kundalini.

11:12.915 --> 11:17.095
She is placed in the Aquarius, and they talk about the Aquarius age.

11:17.165 --> 11:20.894
All kinds of things they are talking, writing, thinking about it,

11:21.014 --> 11:24.444
but when it comes to actualisation.

11:24.444 --> 11:27.454
I think they think I am very too simple for them.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.344
Not complicated.

11:29.354 --> 11:31.921
And Sahaja yoga is too simple.

11:32.001 --> 11:34.391
It should be very complicated.

11:34.391 --> 11:38.661
And all their own ideas about seeking, that they must suffer,

11:38.741 --> 11:40.351
they must go to the Himalayas,

11:40.401 --> 11:42.531
they must starve themselves

11:42.631 --> 11:45.003
and then only they can get realisation

11:47.483 --> 11:53.693
Shri Mataji, is the evolution of the planet closely related to the evolution of humanity?

11:53.803 --> 11:57.401
Of course. It is very much related,

11:57.411 --> 12:01.882
and the planet, our planet is moving in a spiral way.

12:01.911 --> 12:05.122
All the planets are moving in a spiral way

12:05.131 --> 12:10.800
and they are creating all possible things for the use of human beings

12:10.820 --> 12:13.968
so that they can save time.

12:14.018 --> 12:19.559
Save time for getting their ascent and for meditative growth,

12:19.558 --> 12:23.458
but people don’t understand that part.

12:23.458 --> 12:26.528
There are theories around now,

12:26.528 --> 12:30.677
the suggestion so we say, that the planet could be a living organism,

12:30.668 --> 12:32.518
a complete entity?

12:32.538 --> 12:34.278
Of course it is.

12:34.348 --> 12:37.198
One of the examples of this one, I can give you,

12:37.258 --> 12:44.316
is that if you sleep under a coconut tree,

12:44.324 --> 12:47.754
a coconut never falls on anything that is living,

12:47.814 --> 12:50.420
whether it is a human being or a snake.

12:50.424 --> 12:51.764
Never falls.

12:54.514 --> 13:00.489
That is so? Is it all around the world, coconuts never fall on living creatures?

13:00.539 --> 13:02.989
So they understand.

13:03.049 --> 13:10.497
We call it as Shri Pala because we think that it is like a brain which understands.

13:11.377 --> 13:14.650
Well, if this world is a living organism,

13:14.652 --> 13:16.960
what is the brain? What drives this being,

13:16.971 --> 13:21.630
this organism? What has made it evolve the way it has?

13:21.642 --> 13:27.265
There is this subtle power which is all-pervading of God’s love

13:27.255 --> 13:32.705
which manifests all the things like living work,

13:32.725 --> 13:36.161
all nourishment, all balancing.

13:36.175 --> 13:42.481
It’s so balanced if the Pacific was slightly deeper than this,

13:42.515 --> 13:45.039
there would have been problems.

13:46.285 --> 13:54.161
If Himalaya was say one and a half times than what it is,

13:54.178 --> 13:56.308
there would have been problems.

13:56.358 --> 13:59.512
So everything is so balanced in nature,

13:59.518 --> 14:03.422
and the Almighty has created only one world.

14:03.418 --> 14:06.352
Only we human beings have divided

14:06.354 --> 14:10.152
and moved like criminals with our passports in our hands.

14:11.474 --> 14:14.744
Shri Mataji, What we have been talking about,

14:14.794 --> 14:19.004
many people would regard as a belief or a theory.

14:19.023 --> 14:24.183
How does one know the difference between truth and a belief?

14:24.253 --> 14:28.763
First of all anything for which you have to pay money is not the truth.

14:28.775 --> 14:30.210
You can’t pay for the truth.

14:30.235 --> 14:38.326
If you cancel out that, I think 99.9% of all the falsehood will drop out.

14:38.335 --> 14:42.194
But truth to be really actualised

14:42.194 --> 14:45.834
you have to have Self Realisation.

14:45.844 --> 14:49.814
Then you feel on your fingertips vibratory awareness.

14:49.844 --> 14:52.729
A new awareness, a new dimension awareness..

14:52.764 --> 14:56.889
by which you can make out what is true and what is false.

14:56.874 --> 15:01.264
That's an absolute truth that you realise at that stage.

15:02.974 --> 15:06.821
So one must have one’s realisation really to be able, to tell the truth?

15:06.841 --> 15:11.128
Even to follow anyone, one must have Realisation.

15:12.158 --> 15:13.881
Shri Mataji thank you very much.

15:13.893 --> 15:15.272
Thank you.

15:18.522 --> 15:20.962
Russians are doing wonderfully too.

15:22.292 --> 15:23.632
Russians are doing wonderfully.

15:23.762 --> 15:26.176
Shri Mother, I was reading an article just now

15:26.176 --> 15:29.626
where you were talking about inner peace and outer peace?

15:29.626 --> 15:36.476
This seems to be something that attracts the attention of people in a stressful age.

15:38.093 --> 15:39.860
By realisation

15:42.053 --> 15:44.479
what happens, as a result

15:44.489 --> 15:47.314
you become a person

15:47.324 --> 15:50.864
endowed with thoughtless awareness.

15:50.882 --> 15:54.365
That means you see everything.

15:54.374 --> 15:56.674
You witness everything

15:56.704 --> 15:59.195
and whenever you want to

15:59.208 --> 16:03.544
say or to think you can see about it

16:03.565 --> 16:08.289
but you don’t react. There is no reaction.

16:08.298 --> 16:10.111
So you are

16:13.441 --> 16:21.752
empowered to see it in such a manner

16:21.764 --> 16:25.674
that there need not be any thought,

16:25.744 --> 16:30.064
just the whole creation acts on you.

16:30.154 --> 16:32.644
It’s a very subtle thing.

16:32.739 --> 16:34.634
It is to be experienced

16:34.714 --> 16:41.264
and that is the point where we realize that we are the source of peace,

16:41.324 --> 16:44.951
and that is how our inner peace is established.

16:44.962 --> 16:47.172
Now people have many foundations of peace,

16:47.232 --> 16:50.750
I have known all of them. They have no peace within themselves.

16:50.762 --> 16:53.618
Some people have got peace awards

16:53.638 --> 16:56.618
and they're horribly hot-tempered people,

16:56.698 --> 17:00.088
but they have got peace awards, Noble prizes.

17:01.178 --> 17:06.943
The peace has to be first of all found inside and then it manifests outside.

17:09.503 --> 17:13.264
Shri Mataji, another question we wanted to ask you

17:13.260 --> 17:18.249
is because of this rather useful way,

17:18.240 --> 17:23.950
You use your hands to describe the movements of the chakras when they part

17:23.970 --> 17:26.546
I wonder if you could just explain why,

17:26.595 --> 17:32.266
when illness occurs it occurs because of the movement away of one centre from another?

17:32.286 --> 17:33.346
All right.

17:33.365 --> 17:37.636
What I try to show them is that this is the left side, this is the right side.

17:37.623 --> 17:40.123
This is the left sympathetic nervous system say

17:40.183 --> 17:42.753
and this is the right sympathetic nervous system

17:42.813 --> 17:45.853
and really the spinal cord looks like this,

17:45.903 --> 17:48.253
and inside here is the spinal cord

17:49.381 --> 17:50.671
which has the centres in it.

17:50.741 --> 17:51.791
The subtle centres.

17:53.391 --> 17:56.971
Now when you start using the energy of these centres,

17:56.981 --> 17:59.861
say too much on the right

17:59.881 --> 18:03.462
and it starts moving more towards the right

18:03.481 --> 18:05.552
and there is a constriction

18:05.581 --> 18:09.462
and the power becomes less because you are exhausted,

18:09.483 --> 18:11.433
going more towards the right side.

18:11.483 --> 18:15.775
Suddenly something happens and from the left, if there is a jerk,

18:15.773 --> 18:19.355
then the connection is completely broken.

18:19.405 --> 18:23.044
This is on its own. It starts working on its own.

18:23.051 --> 18:27.184
That is what you say that this has become malignant.

18:27.201 --> 18:31.929
It has no relationship with the whole to have proportionate growth

18:31.989 --> 18:35.804
So if the nose starts developing it can cover your eyes

18:35.829 --> 18:37.905
and cover your mouth. Everything!

18:37.939 --> 18:41.359
This is how a cancer is set in or any other disease.

18:41.409 --> 18:43.724
So many psychosomatic diseases

18:43.724 --> 18:47.884
are nothing but somatic is from the right side

18:47.994 --> 18:49.834
and when the psyche gives in,

18:49.884 --> 18:52.564
then it becomes a psychosomatic disease.

18:52.564 --> 18:56.524
There are so many diseases which are more psychosomatic

18:56.554 --> 19:01.374
than physical and these we call them as incurable,

19:01.444 --> 19:05.345
can be easily cured by kundalini awakening

19:05.404 --> 19:07.985
because when kundalini passes through this,

19:08.101 --> 19:09.679
she just integrates them.

19:09.689 --> 19:11.919
For example, she’s going like this

19:11.939 --> 19:16.069
then she goes into this integrates them.

19:16.079 --> 19:20.089
Just like she strings them like pearls

19:20.104 --> 19:25.230
and so they have brought around and also she nourishes that centre.

19:25.234 --> 19:27.495
That's how people get cured,

19:27.545 --> 19:30.710
automatically by themselves, by their own power.

19:33.617 --> 19:41.001
Shri Mataji do you want to speak to the ABC in Adelaide this afternoon

19:41.071 --> 19:45.368
or would you rather that I rang them and said you're too busy?

19:53.729 --> 19:58.127
Yes, abrupt also a very flippant type of thing that is not going to help

19:58.217 --> 20:01.237
They said they wanted to talk to you about false gurus and more.

20:09.093 --> 20:10.543
They have been having little trouble this morning.

20:10.593 --> 20:15.245
You know we have banners to put up announcing your program tonight

20:15.267 --> 20:19.568
and we had them on various bridges and they kept chasing them away

20:19.580 --> 20:22.720
we finally found a place where they've allowed them to stay?

20:28.310 --> 20:33.896
They must be busy with the election. They want to reserve places for election

20:34.026 --> 20:38.145
If it was for the election then they would be able to go anywhere.

20:38.225 --> 20:42.145
If it's anything else they are not so happy.

20:42.265 --> 20:45.445
That shows their attention.
