00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.029
I must thank Kingsley for giving such a nice
introduction.

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:25.990
When I went to Australia, people asked me,
are your disciples all scholars?

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.390
I said, they come from all walks of life,
there are very few who could really be called

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:43.809
scholars but I think after getting realisation,
you being the complete knowledge, new venues

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:53.680
open within you. You start knowing so many
things, like when you enter in this room and

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.430
it is absolutely dark, you can’t see anything.
You don’t know much about it, you don’t

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.359
know how to walk, where to walk, you may just
stumble down, but if there is light, you know

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:13.979
so many things suddenly and you are amazed
at yourself that you have come to know so

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.359
many things.

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:31.259
Now this knowledge that you have, is not the
knowledge that we read in the books. If I

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:40.329
put my finger to this flame here, it will
burn. Anybody who puts the finger to the flame,

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:54.200
it will burn. Now this knowledge that the
finger has to burn has come to us through

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:04.579
our experience and is built within us. Everybody
gets it without paying for it, without making

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.399
any effort for it, it is built in within us.

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:17.340
In the same way, we are so organised within
ourselves, we are made within ourselves so

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:26.030
well that if this happening which he told
you about, the awakening of the kundalini,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.280
if it takes place, it is just like this instrument
being connected to the mains and it starts

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.719
working. I mean you are wonderfully made,
no doubt about it and thousands of years,

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:49.159
thousands and thousands and thousands of years
have passed till you become a human being.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:03:01.319
This human being, the body, the mind is all
made this way, organised this way for one

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:08.219
purpose, and the one purpose is to become
one with your spirit.

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:19.140
Now, why? why should we become one with our
spirit? Because the spirit is the universal

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:27.980
being within us, is the reflection of God
Almighty, is God reflected within us, in our

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:37.719
heart. That spirit is eternal, it is not destructible,
it is unattached and it is the witness of

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:46.459
our lives. It witnesses what we are doing,
it knows all the fields in which we move but

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:54.139
it is not in our conscious mind. We cannot
feel it, we cannot manoeuvre it, we cannot

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.420
understand it’s powers.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:09.760
So the whole being is created, through a power
of desire. The desire which is very strong,

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.819
that you have to become the spirit is still
unmanifested. It is residual and resides in

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:27.039
the triangular bone called sacrum. Sacrum
means sacred. Today on the radio, they asked

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:35.699
me a question, that here the people are so
complicated, do you find it easy to convince

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:45.669
people about God? About Kundalini? They are
very sceptical, is it easy for you to do that?

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:57.069
It’s a very nice question because she could
see my problem. Now I have to tell you one

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:10.090
thing, that this power that resides within
us has been there and many people have talked

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:20.770
about it. It has been there, no doubt about
it, but in modern times we want to know whether

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:30.460
it is there or not. Now there are many people
here who have seen the pulsation of this power

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:36.789
in the triangular bone. They have seen it
and you can also see it, for your conviction,

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:50.360
to see for yourself. But I would suggest that
there is no shop, nothing is selling here.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.770
This kind of sceptical attitude is alright
for people who are going to buy something.

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:05.169
That they want to know whether it is right
or not. Suppose you are entering into a university

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:12.270
and you are there to discover some scientific
knowledge, then do you go with a sceptical

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:25.050
mind? You go with an open mind. You need not
be sceptical and you need not be closed. You

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.319
need not be also following anything blindly
that I say. There is no need to have blind

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:36.129
faith in Sahaja Yoga, no need at all. It is
for you to see for yourself if it works out

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:45.729
or not. One should not come with an attitude
that if it does not work out then there is

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:51.439
something wrong about it, maybe there is something
wrong with you, because there is nothing selling

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:57.710
here, it is a gift. It’s a gift of God,
it’s the grace of God because he is anxious

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:03.569
to save this creation. That’s why he is
giving it to you, to masses, it has never

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:04.970
happened before.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:10.750
This is something so unique that is happening,
I myself am surprised at the way it is working

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:16.189
out. So when all this is happening, why not
benefit by that? It is you who is going to

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:24.849
benefit not me, not at all. When you understand
this, your attitude will be much more positive

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:28.840
towards taking realisation here.

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.460
Now human beings are not going to be happy
without their self being discovered, whatever

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:40.580
you may try. You give them money, they become
affluent then they will become hippies as

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:46.270
they become fed up of it. You give them power,
they will fight among themselves or they give

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:51.360
up politics. They will never be satisfied
with all these things because they know it

00:07:51.360 --> 00:08:00.490
is not satisfying, why? Because satisfaction
can only be enjoyed by the spirit. Only the

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:07.349
spirit can enjoy. Rest of the enjoyments are
temporary, transitory and they vanish into

00:08:07.349 --> 00:08:10.080
thin air.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:16.479
All complexities of life, all problems of
life that faces you, is because without knowing

00:08:16.479 --> 00:08:24.599
the absolute you have gone into relative dimensions.
If you do not know where Brighton is and you

00:08:24.599 --> 00:08:31.189
have to go to Brighton, you move about all
over the places and never reach the point.

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:32.790
You will be complicated, no doubt.

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:39.540
First of all you must discover that absolute,
and that has to be, if you don’t do it,

00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:50.510
you are going to fail, in life, in satisfaction,
in happiness. But, it’s not only that, it’s

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:58.330
much more because the spirit has all the dynamism
of God’s Divine power which is all pervading,

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:03.170
which is everywhere, you cannot feel it, it
is everywhere. I’ll say it is everywhere,

00:09:03.170 --> 00:09:10.780
there is music, drama, you won’t believe
me until I put a television down here. In

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:17.340
the same way unless and until you become one
with yourself, you are not going to feel that

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:26.290
all pervading power, that blissful power of
God because you are not yet there.

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:32.080
You have to enter into the kingdom of God.
Now there is another objection that always

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:38.880
comes in because people are very much Christian
minded and they want to ask me one question

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:45.520
which I have been wanting to answer many a
time. They said that we can only reach God

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:53.220
through Christ. Yes, that’s true but how?
Where is Christ? Where is he? Do they know

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.580
where does he exist? Are we going to pierce
through his body? Where is his body? Where

00:09:57.580 --> 00:09:59.380
do you find him?

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:03.670
He was crucified a long time back, he is no
more. He is not in the churches, of this be

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.940
assured and he is not with the priests at
all, then where is he?

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:14.470
He is within us, now where is he within us?
No one knows about it, he exists within us.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:21.760
I say he exists where? You see this red mark?
Behind that is a centre called agnya chakra,

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:28.070
he resides there. You have to enter through
that door of Christ, you have to awaken them.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.190
Unless and until you awaken Christ, you cannot
enter the kingdom of God.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:39.040
(Mother asks a yogi if they have the chart
so she could have shown the exact location

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.440
of the kingdom of God)

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:47.590
The kingdom of God is the limbic area and
to enter into it, you have to pass through

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:53.310
this very subtle centre which is placed in
the centre of the optic chiasma, the centre

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.420
governs the pituitary and the pineal body.

00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:02.970
You have to cross through that. What is it
to cross? What are you? You are your attention.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:09.650
Your attention has to pass through that and
awaken that centre. When you awaken that centre,

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:16.260
Christ is awakened within you and your ego
and superego, your karmas, so called, your

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.600
sins, so called, all are sucked.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:26.380
You come into that area called the limbic
area, your attention goes there by which you

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:33.310
become collectively conscious, or you can
say first you become just thoughtlessly aware.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:40.020
You are aware and you are thoughtlessly aware.
There is no thought because both the ego and

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.310
superego are sucked in.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:47.550
When the kundalini pierces through this area,
the fontanelle bone area, I mean it’s a

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:54.690
happening. It’s actualisation, it is not
just talking, giving your brain a washing,

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:58.080
that you are all born realised and carry a
banner on your head

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:03.780
‘born again, born again’ as you see many
people. I’m quite amazed at them, the way

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:08.710
they talk. It’s surprising they go around
saying, oh we are already realised souls.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:14.860
I said how? How do you know? The kundalini
is frozen down there, you can see it so clearly.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.160
They say we are born again…self certified..

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:22.300
You cannot get this certificate in any of
these colleges, you cannot have a course in

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.250
this. It’s like sprouting of the seed, now
what course does sprouting of the seed have

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.590
to do, poor thing. You just put it in the
Mother Earth and it sprouts, Mother Earth

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:35.140
knows how to do it.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:43.100
Now this has to happen within us. Another
hurdle in all these western countries I’ve

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.470
seen is this..why me? It’s a very common
question they ask, why you Mother, I say why

00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:50.820
not you? Better have it (Mother’s sweet
laughter)

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:56.360
Better do it yourself, it would be a good
idea, you see I would like to retire, it’s

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:02.160
a very good idea that you do it for me, and
you take my seat. As it is, I’m working

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:07.060
very hard and sometimes my husband also gets
very upset with it. He said it’s too much

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:11.920
you have to work very hard and one day he
put a question to some of the Sahaj Yogis,

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:16.160
he said, now I don’t understand that when
She has given you realisation, why are you

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:23.090
troubling her again and again? What’s the
matter with you? He is a man who has to deal

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:30.260
with shipping and this girl said, Sir if there
are second hand ships you have to repair them

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.350
again and again, but we are fifth hand ships,
so what to do?

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:39.410
So, what I said was that this kind of foolish
attitude and stupid attitude is not going

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:48.200
to help us. For example, this flame is burning,
do we ask the flame why do you burn and not

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:53.670
these flowers? I mean, it’s somebody’s
quality, somebody’s nature, somebody’s

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:58.700
gift or somebody’s speciality you can call
it.

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:02.770
You could be doing this, I would be very happy
if you were doing this, really I tell you,

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:07.000
I would have been very happy, but it is not
so. Now you know so many things, for example,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.390
you know driving. I don’t know, I don’t
even know how to sign a cheque, I’m so hopelessly

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:17.240
bad in banks. I don’t know how to manage
money, I’m hopelessly bad in so many things,

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.010
but I don’t feel bad about it in any way
because supposing I don’t know that, I know

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:30.320
this. I can’t open the switch of an ordinary
tape recorder, but I can open the kundalini,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.230
it’s alright. It’s a different thing altogether
so why should you feel hurt? You cannot do

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:39.080
each and every thing in the world can you?

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:45.720
This kind of an attitude will make you unnecessarily
put a barrier for yourself, because this is

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:52.360
your own, this is within you. I’m a gardener,
I’m doing nothing. I’m just like any enlightened

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.390
light which is going to enlighten you so you
should quieten on this point. Please tell

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.450
your mind to keep quiet on this point.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:11.890
(some communication from the hall re false
prophets)

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:19.630
Nobody talks about them, I’m the only one
talking about them. Beware of them. False

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:23.980
prophets are there but false prophets can
be known, can be understood but people don’t

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:30.180
you see people go head long towards false
prophets. For example if somebody says that

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:37.760
you are going to fly in the air and pay £3000
for that. Are you going to become birds? You

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:44.120
use no brains and you just go straight forward
into it. There are people sitting here who

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:52.910
have become insolvent because they tried to
fly with this guru, but the guru never flew.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:59.790
Now, how to make out a false prophet? The
thing is, you cannot pay for God I’m a happily

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:07.400
married woman, quite well off, I mean I’m
really very happily married, but if I’m

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.870
doing this work, I’m not taking any money
from you, nothing, you can’t pay for it.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.680
It’s something heavenly, this is the second
point.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:26.230
Thirdly…the third sign of a false prophet
is, what has he given you? Have you got your

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:34.320
own powers? Can you feel your own powers?
That’s one of the greatest tests. If somebody

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:42.120
says that oh my guru is great, he’s really
halfway to the lunatic asylum. A recluse and

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.870
abnormal person. My guru has given me this
lunacy and I’ve paid so much money for that.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:51.500
So you ask a question to him, what has he
given you really? Can you feel the kundalini

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:57.000
of this lady or this gentleman? Can you give
them realisation? Can you cure them? Can you

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.890
understand where the problem is? Do you understand
where the problem is within you? Minimum of

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:04.390
minimum!

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:09.339
Supposing somebody says I’ve got my eyes
and he bumps into everything, will you call

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:13.159
that person a person with eyes? You will definitely
say that he doesn’t want to believe that

00:17:13.159 --> 00:17:21.659
he is blind. It is exactly like this, you
must know that if it’s a true person, he

00:17:21.659 --> 00:17:26.149
will give you your own powers.

00:17:26.149 --> 00:17:38.970
(somebody speaking from the public) Mother’s
response:

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:54.149
I wish you could meet somebody
who is here from Scotland, Peter..is he here?
You must meet him and you will know, it’s

00:17:54.149 --> 00:18:01.809
not only money, it’s much worse. I mean,
you have to decide. The other day, I had from

00:18:01.809 --> 00:18:05.539
Norwich, three prople who came to see me,
and they could not put their hands towards

00:18:05.539 --> 00:18:10.100
me, they kept going like this and like that
(possibly shaking). I was amazed and asked

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:16.110
them, where have you been? They said we are
coming from a lunatic asylum. I said really?

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:20.950
We are certified mad people, and where have
they been? To your great Mahashri!

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:25.419
There is a lady in London (Mother asks yogis
if she has come…she was not there so Mother

00:18:25.419 --> 00:18:32.360
mentions all can meet. There is further sound
from the public to which Mother said ‘do

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:39.460
not put me into controversy, better not discuss
these horrible people, that’s all I will

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.490
say, forget them) Further comments from public..

00:18:42.490 --> 00:19:09.610
There are people who are suffering from epilepsy
and they

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:16.230
come to me. They are falling, they have lost
all their wealth, their children are on the

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:22.690
street, they come to me and they want to be
saved. I wish before talking about this, you

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:26.919
better talk to those people who have come
to me and I have saved them. Not only saved

00:19:26.919 --> 00:19:36.320
them, but made something out of them. On the
contrary, this man has made them horrible.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:42.809
Many people who have been there have become
mad. This Mr Ben is suffering from a mysterious

00:19:42.809 --> 00:19:46.429
disease, from where did he get it? There is
one Dr Frenwick, you better go and meet him,

00:19:46.429 --> 00:19:51.580
he is finding out about this fellow, the way
he is giving epilepsy to many and I’ve cured

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:56.909
the epilepsy of so many patients that he is
coming to me to know how I’ve cured them.

00:19:56.909 --> 00:20:04.549
Do you know what dangers you stand with these
people? You have no idea, you are so naïve.

00:20:04.549 --> 00:20:09.090
Did you ask him any questions? Please listen,
you have not come here to give lectures, please

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:14.519
sit down, listen now. You have not come here
to ask questions, you are here to listen to

00:20:14.519 --> 00:20:19.850
me. Nobody asks questions to this dirty man,
never, they just pay him straight forward.

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:26.149
Did they ask any questions to him? Ask this
gentleman or anyone. You just pray in silence,

00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:31.700
you are not even supposed to see this horrible
fellow, he is sitting in a dias somewhere.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:36.220
The way he has led his life, how dare you
compare me with him? You better go and stay

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:40.679
with him. No! I’m just saying you have no
business to take advantage. You see, this

00:20:40.679 --> 00:20:45.870
is not proper, this is taking advantage of
my goodness, you dare not do these things.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:50.830
I don’t like it. It’s alright once in
a while, but not all the time. I have to talk

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:54.720
something, you have come here to listen to
something, alright? Be sensible. (more noise

00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:00.610
from public) No, no you are not everything,
you are just thinking about yourself not others.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.909
You are not the only person sitting down here,
if you want to see me, come and see me privately

00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:08.409
alright? You have to be fair to others isn’t
it? They have come all the way to see me,

00:21:08.409 --> 00:21:13.940
some people have come from Torquay, you should
be more just and fair, I think you have not

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:18.659
been fair to them. It’s alright once in
a while one question I answer but you are

00:21:18.659 --> 00:21:22.909
on and on and on, you must forget it. Listen
to me, it’s not you who is talking, I know

00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:26.389
who is talking behind it, it’s alright.

00:21:26.389 --> 00:21:34.240
Now the people do not say there are false
prophets, they never say and when Christ was

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:42.370
asked, why do you criticise them? He said,
Satan is not going to speak against itself.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:50.120
They are not going to tell, they help each
other. They are the people who help each other,

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:55.279
and you are so mesmerised by them that you
cannot see what wrong they are doing to you,

00:21:55.279 --> 00:21:59.509
until you reach that point where it’s all
finished.

00:21:59.509 --> 00:22:04.279
Now we have here (he has not come but will
be coming, you should meet him) a gentleman

00:22:04.279 --> 00:22:13.330
who has been with this man for the last sixteen
years. He has lost all his money, he has nothing,

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:20.570
he was a diamond merchant his wife is a granddaughter
of a Duke, they are on the street. The wife

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:26.720
used to get such horrible epilepsy, I cured
her. The child was screaming, you were not

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:35.539
there, it’s easy to take a stand for somebody
who is satanic, at least don’t do that.

00:22:35.539 --> 00:22:41.360
You don’t know how people are harmed, everyday
I’m facing it, everyday I’m curing people.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.399
There are three people I know of who got cancer
out of this and tomorrow if anybody gets out

00:22:46.399 --> 00:22:52.730
of you, I’ll have to cure. He has taken
all the money, that’s all. I have every

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:58.779
right to criticise them and say they are wrong,
because I’m the one who’s curing people,

00:22:58.779 --> 00:23:04.090
who are harmed by them, tortured by them.
I’m not saying just for fun sake, people

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:08.789
have no courage to say also. How many have
courage to say that they are wrong and they

00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:13.610
have harmed? Very few people, they are cowards,
I would like to know how many people can say

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:16.299
that openly that they are wrong, they have
harmed?

00:23:16.299 --> 00:23:20.340
There are some people sitting here, who have
been harmed who came to me and I have cured

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:27.649
them. You need a lot of courage and understanding,
not only that but I am really angry with them

00:23:27.649 --> 00:23:33.340
because these are seekers of truth. These
are people seeking the truth and these people

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:39.639
are not to be harmed by anyone. They are to
be given their realisation, they have to enter

00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:41.070
into the kingdom of God.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:47.580
God is anxiously waiting to give them what
they deserve. They are such great people,

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.570
while these people (false gurus) wanted to
make money! They could have smuggled, they

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:56.190
could have done other things, money is not
the only point but the way they have ruined

00:23:56.190 --> 00:24:01.419
the possibilities of their realisation! I
know of three others who are still in the

00:24:01.419 --> 00:24:06.350
lunatic asylum and I cannot save them. They
are all lost and the government doesn’t

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:09.600
want to know anything about it. They went
and saw the police and the police said, what

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:13.149
are we to do if you are fool and stupid people
who go ahead and spend your money and get

00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:16.619
these devils upon yourself?

00:24:16.619 --> 00:24:20.909
You must open your eyes and see for yourself
and see what is happening to your brothers

00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:28.220
and sisters. Where are they going? I’m sorry
I have to use strong words but I really strongly

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:32.460
feel about all these things. Actually I had
no idea that they have really done all these

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:37.499
things to you. The more I see, the more I’m
surprised. One by one, they are all getting

00:24:37.499 --> 00:24:43.799
exposed. They are all getting exposed because
whatever is false will come to the light,

00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:48.490
no doubt, I’m sure of it, it will have to
come to light but one more thing is there

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:55.659
which makes me unhappy, sad and sometimes
really restless that these are good innocent

00:24:55.659 --> 00:25:06.759
people that are harmed so much, beyond repair.
I cannot repair them, they are finished, lost

00:25:06.759 --> 00:25:08.779
and gone.

00:25:08.779 --> 00:25:15.669
You are not in this business, I am and I know
what it is, how bad it is, how dangerous it

00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:22.419
is and so unfair to human beings who have
been created so beautifully from the amoeba

00:25:22.419 --> 00:25:27.190
stage to this stage, and these people should
come and hit them because they are seekers?!

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:33.600
Because they are simple? All ego oriented.
Most of these organisations are ego oriented.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.279
They pamper your ego, like having a world
organisation. They believe in it! Can you

00:25:37.279 --> 00:25:40.950
imagine, they believe in it.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:47.210
A person is asked to wear special clothes
and are given chairs gilded with gold and

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:53.119
they feel they have become ministers and prime
ministers. If you want to go on believing

00:25:53.119 --> 00:25:54.909
myths, go ahead.

00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:59.299
I’m here to tell you the truth, whether
you like it or not, I have to tell you the

00:25:59.299 --> 00:26:05.690
truth, and the truth is the thing. Why should
I criticise anyone? That’s not my job, but

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:13.139
I see the way people are being harmed and
tortured, you want me to garland them and

00:26:13.139 --> 00:26:18.720
say they are very nice people? Should I? Would
you do the same if you were in my place? If

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:24.059
you were a Mother who feels for her children,
would you do that? Any Mother who says that

00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:28.990
she can do it, I would like to know such a
person.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:33.830
I know how to be charitable and how to be
generous, but not to those who deliberately

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:41.909
try to hamper your progress in life. They
do not criticise anybody, naturally, why will

00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:47.639
they? No thief will criticise another thief,
do they? They are all in one line and work

00:26:47.639 --> 00:26:51.440
it out.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:58.230
One has to understand, that a true prophet
or a true person, will give you the truth

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:05.820
and nothing else. And the truth is that you
are the spirit. You have to become that, nothing

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:11.220
else. You have to become the spirit. Unless
and until you become the spirit, all these

00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:19.220
other ideas of giving you relaxation or giving
you some sort of a patchy thing is not going

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.629
to happen.

00:27:20.629 --> 00:27:25.539
Now the trouble is, in the west, people are
extremely naïve, absolutely naïve. They

00:27:25.539 --> 00:27:30.249
have no knowledge of the internal life, they
know about science as we are naïve about

00:27:30.249 --> 00:27:36.320
science you can say. We are naïve about the
lights and things in the banks maybe, but

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.610
for the internal life you are absolutely naïve
and you do not know how many stratas there

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:46.649
are within you. The first thing you must know
is that you live in the past and the future,

00:27:46.649 --> 00:27:49.830
not in the present.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:56.950
The past is the subconscious and the future
is the supraconscious. These two areas exist

00:27:56.950 --> 00:28:02.269
within us, within our body, one on the left
hand side and the other on the right hand

00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:08.529
side. When somebody contracts a disease like
say cancer, the attacks are from these areas.

00:28:08.529 --> 00:28:16.559
These areas are built within us from our creation.
They are within us since we were created.

00:28:16.559 --> 00:28:22.320
These attacks come to us, for example even
a virus infection, even a possession that

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:30.739
comes upon us, cancer, all these attacks come
to us, not because of our present, but because

00:28:30.739 --> 00:28:36.720
of our past. From somewhere, it attacks us.

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:42.909
If you have to understand yourself, then you
must understand yourself in full perspective,

00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:46.350
not that somebody gives you a mantra and you
take the mantra for £300 and the meaning

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:53.039
of the mantra is ‘I’m coming’ or some
sort of nonsense, which is not even Sanskrit.

00:28:53.039 --> 00:29:00.580
You don’t know any Sanskrit. So these things
are put through in your subconscious and they

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:07.289
work on you, and you feel a little bit relieved,
like with alcohol you may feel relieved for

00:29:07.289 --> 00:29:12.249
the time being. For the time being, you may
feel very elated and your ego will come up

00:29:12.249 --> 00:29:17.809
and you become a great person demanding this.
Like a man who was walking on the street,

00:29:17.809 --> 00:29:24.259
was drunk and the king was going on a horse.
He asked the king, I want to but this horse

00:29:24.259 --> 00:29:30.940
now get down from there. So the king said,
now you really want it? Alright, tomorrow.

00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:36.059
He went away. The king was a wise man. The
next day he called the fellow and said now

00:29:36.059 --> 00:29:40.340
do you want to buy the horse? He said ‘sir,
the one who was going to buy, is finished,

00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:43.779
he’s no more’. It’s like that.

00:29:43.779 --> 00:29:51.919
Suddenly, you see these subconscious spirits
or things that they possess you with, give

00:29:51.919 --> 00:29:59.340
you a very heightened ego, and the whole thing
fizzles out, but you do not know from where

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:06.580
they come and where they go, you cannot understand
them and you cannot manoeuvre them. When you

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:11.970
become yourself, you know each and every thing.
For example, this gentleman who was asking

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:16.899
me questions, he does not know anything about
himself, neither about others. You ask any

00:30:16.899 --> 00:30:21.559
Sahaja yogi who is here, even a little child
will say what chakras are catching in him

00:30:21.559 --> 00:30:30.059
and what chakras are catching in you. It has
to be your own knowledge, in your own awareness,

00:30:30.059 --> 00:30:34.489
understand you are intelligent people, you
are not fools. I’m not talking to fools,

00:30:34.489 --> 00:30:40.629
I’m talking to intelligent people, who understand
things. If something has to happen to you,

00:30:40.629 --> 00:30:46.059
it has to happen in your awareness, like a
dog has a different awareness and you have

00:30:46.059 --> 00:30:52.200
a different awareness. You take any dog, even
if it is a pedigree dog, through any dirt

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.629
or filth, it doesn’t smell, it doesn’t
feel bad, it doesn’t understand beauty,

00:30:55.629 --> 00:30:56.619
while you do.

00:30:56.619 --> 00:31:02.549
In the same way, something has to happen in
your awareness and that’s how you have to

00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:10.899
make it out. Unless and until that happens,
what’s the use? What’s the use of coming

00:31:10.899 --> 00:31:17.239
here? Just arguing with me, no use, you have
to get it. You have to get that within yourself.

00:31:17.239 --> 00:31:23.489
If that can happen within you, then only you
will be entitled as a self realised person,

00:31:23.489 --> 00:31:24.960
otherwise you will not.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:30.190
There is no organisation for them outside
because you are already organised by God.

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:36.419
It’s all in there. Once it works out, you
start feeling it within you.

00:31:36.419 --> 00:31:41.779
Now, why people are false gurus? Let’s see
that point, then you will understand. First

00:31:41.779 --> 00:31:49.230
you must see the background of these people.
For example, the gentleman about whom he is

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:55.119
saying, he was a clerk, railway clerk. There
are many other things about him which Indians

00:31:55.119 --> 00:32:04.639
know. They don’t mind because he brings
lots of foreign exchange. Then there could

00:32:04.639 --> 00:32:11.239
be any thug or anybody in jail in India, who
comes out of the jail and has no place in

00:32:11.239 --> 00:32:18.450
society and comes to London and sits down
with funny dresses, with little horns around

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:24.299
and all the British will be at his feet. Very
good idea!

00:32:24.299 --> 00:32:28.950
There should be no pretensions, if you are
true, there should be no pretensions about

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:38.399
anything whatsoever. You should be straightforward
and normal, because you don’t want anything

00:32:38.399 --> 00:32:46.090
from anyone. I would say if I asked you to
stay with me without paying any amount or

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:52.869
any money, you would not accept such a situation.
You would feel hurt. But these people are

00:32:52.869 --> 00:32:58.090
parasites, of the worst type. They live on
your money.

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:03.480
Christ was the son of a carpenter, he didn’t
ask for money from anyone, did he? He did

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:11.470
the carpenters job. You can’t understand
it because it’s the ego, it’s a very subtle

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:22.940
ego that you have purchased your guru. You
cannot purchase Me. You cannot purchase your

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:29.080
realisation, God doesn’t understand money,
he doesn’t understand banks, that’s your

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:33.879
headache. So to understand a real Guru, one
should know what you have to expect yourself.

00:33:33.879 --> 00:33:40.749
Now we have got so many people like you, I
mean you are so well read, I see all of you

00:33:40.749 --> 00:33:46.159
reading all the time, even in the bathrooms
when you go, you read. On the trains, you

00:33:46.159 --> 00:33:51.460
are reading, all the time you are reading
and I think nothing is registered there. Otherwise,

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:57.869
it is written very clearly, by a very great
scientist like (unclear) that there is a collective

00:33:57.869 --> 00:34:08.530
consciousness within us. That there is some
sort of power within us which gives us symbols

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:19.700
which are universal in our dreams. He has
proved it. If so, then that collective unconscious

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:23.730
within us has to become conscious within us.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:30.500
This is what any true Prophet will tell you.
He will not give you a thing that you have

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:36.100
to jump all the time or that you have to take
out your clothes or stand on your head, because

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:41.510
it is very simple to understand that by doing
any effort you are not going to go to God.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:46.140
By doing anything you are not going to do.
What did you do to become human beings? If

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:55.510
it is evolutionary, what did you do? Did you
cut your tails as monkeys? You got it without

00:34:55.510 --> 00:35:00.420
doing anything. In the same way, if evolution
has to take place, it will be done without

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:06.350
any effort, because it is so vital, it is
so important. You do not understand the importance

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:13.500
of that, you want to play about with all nonsensical
things. The most vital thing today is to evolve

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:21.370
and this evolution must take place, and this
takes place within us because a system has

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:26.830
been built within us already, it exists within
us and you can see with your naked eyes the

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:32.480
rising of the kundalini, the breaking of the
Sahasrara, the breaking of the fontanelle

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:41.780
bone area which is the real actual Baptism.
It’s not artificially done, you can feel

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:55.700
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out
of you and the Holy Ghost is
the power of God which is reflected within

00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:05.660
us as Kundalini. She rises and She gives you
this realisation, though the heart has the

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:09.600
spirit in itself, the seat of the spirit,
she is here (Shri Mataji must be pointing

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.840
at the area) and that’s how first the Kundalini
rises and you get enlightenment in your brain.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:22.100
First the enlightenment comes to your brain
in England. In India it comes to the heart.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:30.870
Here we analyse, we think too much, we try
to analyse everything, what can you analyse?

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:37.110
This flower becomes a fruit tomorrow, can
you analyse it? Can you do it? Thousands and

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:44.180
thousands, billions and billions are being
transformed, how can you analyse your transformation?

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:51.620
You cannot. With this little brain of yours,
with this little rationality, you try to analyse,

00:36:51.620 --> 00:37:01.760
you cannot. It has to be logical, and if it
is not logical then it has no meaning, but

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:09.160
it will become logical when it happens, let
it happen to you. If it does not happen to

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.340
you, it’s not going to work out.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:17.710
These are typical type of people that come
and disturb always my programmes, I’ve seen

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:23.830
it, for nothing at all, but these are the
people who pay lots of money without asking

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:28.840
any questions, do not get anything, get horrible
diseases into themselves and then they come

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:35.580
to me for realisation. I can’t understand
what’s happening to you, I don’t know

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:43.710
how to make you understand that you have no
value of your own, you have no esteem of your

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:50.150
own. How can you appreciate such people who
are openly befooling you? Who are stupefying

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:54.670
you? They do not criticise others according
to you, they are very nice people, you mean

00:37:54.670 --> 00:38:02.470
to say I should not even criticise Hitler?
This is not the best way of looking at things.

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:09.430
You have to face things as they are, you should
know bad is bad and good is good.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:14.730
Tomorrow you will say, don’t even criticise
if people get cancers, don’t even look after

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:21.890
it, let them die…praise cancer should I?
praise epilepsy should I?

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:30.040
We must understand, God has given us discrimination.
We must have our discrimination and understand,

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:36.930
what are we doing? What is our life for? Why
have we come on this earth? Because I open

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:44.770
your eyes to these things, you have to know
that I am not false. That’s one thing, I

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:49.270
want you to face the truth. I do not want
you to live with myths. I could have said

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:56.270
that I’ll make you fly, I’ll make something
out of this, why should I? That’s not my

00:38:56.270 --> 00:39:03.100
job, that’s not the way I am. I’m a different
type, absolutely different and this is the

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:12.030
type always has been denied, not today, always.
Why Christ was denied? For what? All of them

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:23.080
were denied and all the false were accepted.
They even forgave a robber and crucified Christ.

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:28.720
Same type of people are again on this earth
I find, they do not want to accept the truth.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:37.440
Now, the society is such, no one can crucify
me. They could not have crucified Christ if

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:42.520
he did not want to be crucified, he was such
a powerful man. He is going to come back with

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:48.960
his powers again and he is going to neutralise
all these horrible powers in them to cut them

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:55.280
out. No doubt about it, but before that time,
you have to be counselled, you have to be

00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:00.410
told how to enter into the kingdom of God.
You have to become what you are because the

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:05.610
last judgement has started, this is the last
judgement. How God is going to judge you?

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:09.110
Just think of it, is He going to judge you
the way you are educated? The way you are

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:16.180
dressed? No. Through your inner happening,
through your inner understanding and light

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:22.220
that is within you. That’s how he is going
to judge you. I’m here to give you light

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:28.460
that is your own, just an enlightened light
enlightens you. I don’t want to pamper your

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:34.210
ego or to run you down but I want to tell
you that you should become yourself. I see

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:38.800
the beauty within you, I see that diamond
within you, that’s why I’m doing all this

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.010
work. You do not see it, I just want you to
feel it and have it, it’s a very simple

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:48.800
thing. What is there to be so much worried
about? To talk about other people who have

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:54.170
done nothing, there are 90,000 people doing
TM and what are they? They are recluses, you

00:40:54.170 --> 00:41:02.100
show them garlic and they will faint. There
was a gentleman, I don’t know if he has

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:10.410
come, who just on the phone he talked to a
Sahaj Yogi, Douglas, who is sitting here and

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:19.360
he was shaking. He said ‘I am shaking, what’s
the matter with me?’ Douglas told him that

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:24.270
you are very hot? He said yes I’m perspiring,
I don’t know what’s happening to me. He

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:33.830
knew what was happening, he accepted it. Then
Douglas asked him, are you doing some meditation?

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:39.580
He said yes how do you know? Douglas said,
we know, we know all that. He is saved today

00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:44.560
and he is a big man in Brighton. He is working
as Managing Director, otherwise he would have

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:50.080
ended up in a lunatic asylum and this is what
it is. People do not question such people,

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:55.470
they have got their circuses, they have got
big (unclear) all things to announce themselves

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:59.470
and people think they must be great people.

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:05.030
Christ was a simple man, wasn’t he? He was
so simple. He didn’t have any advertisement

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:09.810
and all that. He didn’t have all these things
to impress you. What should impress you is

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:15.870
your own transformation and nothing else.
That should impress you. You should ask for

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:20.710
your own transformation, for your own happiness,
for what you are going to gain. If you even

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:27.240
go to a shop, don’t you see how much you
get out of it? In the same way, in spirit

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:32.290
also you should not see what you give but
what you get. It’s not material that you

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:38.830
get, you get something so substantial that
it transcends all material and all sorts of

00:42:38.830 --> 00:42:39.460
problems.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:45.090
We have one gentleman sitting here who you
can talk to later, who came last time. He

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:51.940
was a drunkard, an alcoholic, he couldn’t
talk to me and he was horrid, he behaved about

00:42:51.940 --> 00:43:42.730
the same way as this gentleman has behaved,
because he was so drunk. I forgave him, alright.

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:57.770
He went away. He was so lost to life, there
was no hope for him. About a month back, again

00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:02.700
he came to know about my coming, so he came
to the centre. These people worked on him.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:08.640
He is a first class man now, he has joined
a college, studying there. I couldn’t recognise

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:14.790
him, he was so changed, he was looking so
much younger, so much better. You must know

00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:24.840
that the task is so great, the task of saving
this humanity. It’s not a simple task and

00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:35.250
you all should get it for your good, for your
meditation, it’s your own. I have not seen

00:44:35.250 --> 00:44:44.440
anyone, any animal, if you do good to him
he barks at you, he does not, but only among

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:53.010
human beings who try to deprive you, who try
to deceive you, you are happy with them because

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:59.410
they have a camouflage. They say things which
are very sweet and nice, don’t depend on

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:04.730
them, you have to face the fact as it is.
These are horrid people, not only horrid,

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:10.710
they are satanic, they are extremely evil
and they are doing all kinds of evil and I’m

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:11.670
not afraid of them.

00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:17.700
I’ve said it openly in 1970, against them,
each one of them by taking their names. They

00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:22.510
have not taken me to courts because they know
I know about them. They have never taken me

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:28.120
to anything, why don’t they file a suit
against me? Because, they are cowards, they

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:32.120
know what wrong they are doing to you. I can
prove it to them.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:37.930
One should understand that there is somebody
who is talking so bravely, that’s a lady

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:43.410
also. There must be something about me that
I’m concerned, that my concern is so deep

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:48.790
that I’m not worried about them, I’m not
afraid of them. When I first spoke in 1970,

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:54.630
so many people were my disciples, well placed
in life, they came and told me, don’t do

00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:58.430
these things, don’t talk against them, they
may come and murder you. I said, let me see

00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:02.680
who’s going to murder me, none of them.
On the contrary, I was amazed the other day,

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:10.860
a girl told me that one of them was saying
I was his sister. I was amazed. Imagine and

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:16.340
another was saying that I was his disciple,
this was another news to me. I said, really?

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:25.710
I’ve been criticising him right from 1970
and he is saying that I’m his sister.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:31.330
You will know all about them, first of all
get your realisation. Get your eyes, get your

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:39.580
spirit get yourself into that which is the
glorious, the beauty and the knowledge. Then

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:44.480
you will know what I’m talking about. You
will yourself know about it. I don’t have

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.940
to tell you, I don’t really start such a
topic except when somebody stands up, he must

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:51.210
have come to represent this man, no doubt,
but he doesn’t know that he’s representing

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:56.620
a satan. He is innocent, simple and naïve,
one has to forgive, you all should forgive

00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:58.310
him.

00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:00.350
May God bless you all.

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:05.280
I would like you to ask me questions but sensible
questions not pleading someone because if

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:10.590
you want I can say that also. I’m not afraid,
I can say but why? Why discuss these horrible

00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:18.400
people here? I’ve already headaches from
them, lots of them, really. For example, these

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:25.660
TM people in India, I could never give realisation.
We never wanted them near, I could never give

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:31.450
them realisation, only after coming to London
I started doing it. Amazingly. I could not

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:37.960
give them realisation, the Sahaj Yogis never
wanted them, they said that whenever anybody

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:41.670
came from TM they used to ask, are you from
TM? There is no programme. They used to turn

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:49.800
them away. They were so difficult, so heavy,
impossible. It’s a fact. I mean, we don’t

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:57.230
like people to come and trouble us, but what
to do? The door is open, anybody can come,

00:47:57.230 --> 00:48:02.380
you don’t have to pay any money, just walk
in. Do what you like. It’s alright, but

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:08.050
still, I must say Sahaja Yoga has done tremendous
work even in England, where I found it was

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:12.910
very difficult. In the beginning, I was working
only with six people for four years, you won’t

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:18.560
believe it. My husband has been elected to
this job and we have been here for seven years,

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:23.170
and four years I was struggling with six of
them, can you imagine. Only last three years

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:28.010
we have been able to do something. I’ve
seen it’s rather difficult to break people

00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:34.510
here, but once they understand, they go very
deep down, they are very scholarly and wonderful

00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:38.020
people, no doubt, and it has worked out.

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:43.400
You can ask me some questions if you want
to, but ask sensible questions and not unnecessarily

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:48.370
wasting everybody’s time and it’s not
only you who is listening to me, others are

00:48:48.370 --> 00:49:08.490
also listening, so you should not take all
my time, isn’t it?

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:19.760
There are many children who are born realised,
many children in this country who are born

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:25.590
realised and there are very young people I
met about three of them today, who are realised

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:30.880
souls. Great people, but you would never understand
them and they would never understand you,

00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.920
there would be a conflict. I don’t know
what’s going to happen if you don’t listen

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:44.710
to me. You have to be realised to understand
them, because even after realisation there

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:51.180
are problems and you start seeing your problems
and you have to cure them. You have to get

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:54.930
well.

00:49:54.930 --> 00:49:57.280
Ask some questions now.

00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:13.750
(Question from public…Mother’s joyous
laughter while saying that’s the best question)

00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:50.740
They have asked for realisation and Shri Mataji
proceeds to ask everybody to take off their

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:56.530
shoes and sit with hands on laps facing up.

00:50:56.530 --> 00:51:29.680
Close your eyes, just close your eyes.

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:35.370
Now what do you feel actually, you see first
you feel thoughtlessly aware, means there

00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:36.080
is no thought within your mind.

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:45.140
If you
see your mind, there is no thought, you feel
like that, first thing that should happen

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:49.660
to you. It’s your own, you shouldn’t believe
me, you shouldn’t believe anybody else but

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:55.230
see for yourself if there is no thought, but
don’t deny anything. If it not so, it goes

00:51:55.230 --> 00:52:01.210
further. When the kundalini rises about agnya,
it shoots off, in many people it shoots off.

00:52:01.210 --> 00:52:06.490
First experiences have been very great with
many people and then when it passes through

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:12.130
the last centre or pierces through this fontanelle
area then you start feeling the cool breeze

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:16.390
in your hands. Some people who smoke too much
do not feel it in the hands so much as they

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:24.170
feel it in their heads because this centre
is spoilt.

00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:28.130
Now close your eyes, you have to close your
eyes because when the kundalini rises, if

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:35.030
your eyes are not closed, it won’t rise
above agnya. It’s just the opposite of mesmerism.

00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:44.060
Close your eyes…place both your hands straight
like this because these are the centres of

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:55.890
the sympathetic within us, these are seven
centres…five, six and seven (Shri Mataji

00:52:55.890 --> 00:53:33.990
must be referring to a chart). Just close
your eyes. Let it go, don’t force your attention

00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:42.710
to be fixed anywhere, just let it go. Now
the first problem I feel that is collectively

00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:47.560
within you is that you have to forgive others.
You better forgive, forgive everyone, just

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:52.540
say I forgive, that’s very important, it
will unload your mind. Say it thrice, Mother

00:53:52.540 --> 00:54:45.530
I forgive, it’s very good for you to say
that I forgive. Please forgive.

00:54:45.530 --> 00:55:14.560
Now after saying that, you have to also say
that if I’ve not paid full attention to

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:23.280
my spirit or if I’ve been negligent about
it, forgive me. But don’t build guilt at

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:29.160
all, just say forgive me and it is finished.
Don’t build guilt because this is another

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:34.690
fashion to feel guilty for nothing at all.
There’s nothing to feel guilty.

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:45.920
Say thrice please forgive me if I’ve not
paid attention to my spirit. Immediately I

00:55:45.920 --> 00:56:02.840
think you should say I’m not guilty, thrice,
because this may build a kind of guilt.

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:08.090
Immediately after saying please forgive me,
say that I’m not guilty, thrice, please

00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:09.010
say.

00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:20.010
Now you can ask a question, Mother am I the
spirit? Thrice. Put your right hand on your

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:27.230
heart and ask the question, with all sincerity
and truthfulness, because Sahaja Yoga judges

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:37.540
your truthfulness. Just ask Mother am I the
spirit?

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:46.590
Just ask a simple question and you will get
vibrations in your hands as proof of it. Ask

00:56:46.590 --> 00:57:04.060
it, most of you will get it, cool breeze in
the hand, cool breeze of the holy ghost. Don’t

00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:09.250
think about it, it’s a happening. If you
think about it, it will never work out. It

00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:21.120
is beyond thinking. It will just work out.
If you start thinking about it, it’s going

00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:28.840
to be another useless wandering that’s all.
You will be wasting your time as you have

00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:36.980
wasted so far, you will be wasting more. Don’t
think about it.

00:57:36.980 --> 00:58:03.780
Now if you’re feeling on the left hand then
put your right hand towards me, both hands.

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:09.590
If it is not working on the right hand, then
put left hand on your stomach, maybe something

00:58:09.590 --> 00:58:19.570
wrong with your stomach. If it’s not working
on the right hand, put it on the stomach asking

00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:32.430
a question, Mother am I my own guru? Am I
my own teacher? Ask a question to me.

00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:41.280
If you are getting in both hands, don’t
think about it, it’s there. You got it.

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:49.480
Ask the question, if it works then you will
find a cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:53.640
It’s a mass happening, it’s happening
to thousands, so it should happen just see

00:58:53.640 --> 00:59:03.210
if it is coming out of your head.

00:59:03.210 --> 00:59:39.480
Now put both your hands towards me and close
your eyes and don’t think, just don’t

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:52.920
think, please close your eyes. Don’t watch
others, just close your eyes.

00:59:52.920 --> 01:00:12.910
Shri Mataji Blows…..

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:26.680
Those who are feeling the cool breeze, please
raise your hands. Those who are not feeling

01:00:26.680 --> 01:00:33.350
the cool breeze raise your hands because we
will have to just work it out, alright. I’ll

01:00:33.350 --> 01:00:37.370
have to ask some of the sahaj yogis to come
and see what’s the problem, you shouldn’t

01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:44.040
mind because tomorrow when you get it, you
will be able to do it yourself. I will also

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:50.410
come and see, because it means there is some
sort of obstruction and we have to remove

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:57.150
it. Now it’s flowing from the hands of these
sahaj yogis and they are giving thing to their

01:00:57.150 --> 01:01:01.110
aura because they don’t want to be caught
up with your auras, but then when they raise

01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:05.350
your kundalini, you will see yourself how
they work it out. They are just like you people,

01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:10.690
they have learnt and you are going to learn
from them, then you are going to do the same, alright.
