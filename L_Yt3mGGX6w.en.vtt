00:00.041 --> 00:01.550
Diwali Puja, Los Angeles, USA November 18, 2001

07:10.415 --> 07:13.415
It’s a very, very great day today, I should say,

07:15.295 --> 07:21.505
where the evil has been suppressed.

07:53.375 --> 08:01.335
The evil that spreads its power all over

08:02.295 --> 08:06.585
is only because of two factors.

08:08.295 --> 08:14.415
One is that you are not knowledgeable,

08:16.415 --> 08:19.335
you are still blind,

08:20.505 --> 08:24.625
and you follow things

08:25.455 --> 08:28.375
which are not right but you think are powerful.

08:31.255 --> 08:38.295
This illusion creates not only problems,

08:39.415 --> 08:43.625
but absolute destruction.

08:46.665 --> 08:50.545
So we faced a very big challenge, no doubt

08:53.295 --> 08:59.415
and it was easily solved.

09:04.295 --> 09:07.375
It was based on all wrong basis,

09:08.505 --> 09:11.415
just to create a problem.

09:14.295 --> 09:19.585
Problem was created with a purpose,

09:25.585 --> 09:28.455
and nobody could imagine

09:30.295 --> 09:34.665
that it would be solved so easily and so quickly.

09:36.665 --> 09:42.625
My desire was to get over it before Diwali that has happened.

10:02.295 --> 10:08.295
Due to ignorance also, people do lots of things.

10:09.415 --> 10:13.415
Anybody who follows some religion or some sort of a thing,

10:14.375 --> 10:19.415
it’s only because they’re not aware of the truth,

10:20.335 --> 10:24.415
they’re ignorant about achieving the truth,

10:25.505 --> 10:29.415
and they cling on to the fact

10:30.375 --> 10:33.295
that they know everything.

10:33.665 --> 10:36.505
With all this happening,

10:37.415 --> 10:40.255
there have been so many fractions,

10:40.505 --> 10:42.625
so many stupid people

10:44.375 --> 10:51.295
who are getting completely ruined by ignorance.

10:53.665 --> 10:56.415
Now that we’re coming to Sahaja Yoga,

10:57.505 --> 11:03.295
you know all the knowledge – very subtle knowledge,

11:04.295 --> 11:08.585
very subtle. It’s not superficial knowledge,

11:09.455 --> 11:11.455
it is very subtle.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.665
And because they don’t know this subtle knowledge,

11:16.375 --> 11:20.585
they fall into the wrong path of,

11:21.455 --> 11:26.415
I should say, ignorance and then they try to oppose

11:27.295 --> 11:29.255
the people who are doing good.

11:32.255 --> 11:35.295
But above all is the power of God.

11:36.665 --> 11:42.335
All this drama is played to prove the existence

11:42.545 --> 11:44.505
of that great Power.

11:45.665 --> 11:48.545
It has all worked out so well,

11:49.375 --> 11:51.625
and for all of you Sahaja yogis

11:52.505 --> 11:57.255
it’s a very great achievement that you can see the play.

11:58.545 --> 12:01.585
Many people who have achieved

12:02.295 --> 12:04.585
so-called success cannot see that point,

12:05.625 --> 12:10.295
but you can see it because you are spectators.

12:11.415 --> 12:17.255
Though all the world is a part and parcel of that drama,

12:17.665 --> 12:20.585
you are outside and you can see it so clearly.

12:21.375 --> 12:25.705
Whatever has happened, nobody could have believed

12:26.545 --> 12:28.705
that would finish before Diwali.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.375
So it goes like this, the stupidity

12:34.375 --> 12:36.455
which is being created;

12:37.295 --> 12:40.755
and we also sometimes think that this kind of stupid thing

12:41.375 --> 12:45.665
will impress others. Impression is not the point.

12:47.505 --> 12:52.295
If you see among all these people who have lost,

12:53.455 --> 12:56.415
what impression have they created?

12:57.295 --> 13:00.455
They were there to create a great impression on everyone,

13:01.585 --> 13:06.335
to show as if they were great warriors and fighters.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.755
But what impression they have created?

13:11.505 --> 13:14.455
Whether you are a realized soul or not,

13:16.295 --> 13:20.335
they can see that it’s a miracle,

13:21.415 --> 13:24.585
it’s a miracle how things have worked out.

13:31.375 --> 13:35.415
Now the new phase has started.

13:38.375 --> 13:44.415
You all have a very, very open challenge

13:45.585 --> 13:48.625
to get people into enlightenment.

13:51.295 --> 13:53.705
People are not so ignorant now,

13:54.415 --> 13:56.585
they are not so much blasted.

13:57.585 --> 14:01.415
Moreover, I find them very much changed.

14:01.795 --> 14:08.295
Their attitude towards truth has changed,

14:08.705 --> 14:10.585
and they understand

14:11.295 --> 14:14.585
there is truth beyond all this that they have known.

14:15.665 --> 14:17.455
It’s very important,

14:18.295 --> 14:24.295
because if a human being starts thinking

14:24.545 --> 14:27.505
“this is the truth,” he just gets stuck up.

14:28.585 --> 14:31.375
At any cost, whatever may happen,

14:32.295 --> 14:34.705
he’ll go on sticking to that.

14:36.455 --> 14:41.335
He won’t be able even to verify whether it is the truth or not.

14:42.415 --> 14:47.665
Animals can. How? Because they have got innate capacity

14:48.545 --> 14:53.665
to smell the evil – innate.

14:55.455 --> 14:57.705
We cannot, human beings cannot.

14:58.625 --> 15:01.755
If there’s a evil man, a dog will bark at him.

15:03.545 --> 15:09.415
Otherwise he’ll go and throw him down.

15:10.755 --> 15:14.505
He’ll do everything which is not normally done.

15:15.705 --> 15:21.705
How is it he has developed this capacity to find out

15:22.585 --> 15:25.415
who is a thief and who is not?

15:27.335 --> 15:29.705
We have a higher awareness.

15:30.585 --> 15:35.295
We think about many things which animals cannot think.

15:36.585 --> 15:41.625
We understand many things which animals cannot understand.

15:43.255 --> 15:45.545
We cook our food – they don’t.

15:46.585 --> 15:51.415
But also I sometimes, I think we cook our brains,

15:53.545 --> 15:57.335
because the way people behave

15:58.625 --> 16:04.255
and try to avoid the truth with their ego is surprising.

16:05.795 --> 16:07.665
All this happening

16:08.505 --> 16:11.585
is a drama, as I told you, but you better study it  properly

16:12.625 --> 16:14.795
and apply it to yourself, and see

16:15.375 --> 16:18.625
if you are also a part and parcel of that drama.

16:20.415 --> 16:23.705
For that, you have to rise higher.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.415
You have to rise higher

16:28.585 --> 16:34.335
– higher above your ego and your superego, your conditioning,

16:36.505 --> 16:39.665
and from there to watch yourself and see yourself:

16:41.375 --> 16:45.295
“What is this? Why am I doing such a thing?

16:46.255 --> 16:48.415
Why my attention is like that?

16:48.705 --> 16:51.335
What is the main reason

16:52.665 --> 16:57.335
for my own

16:59.295 --> 17:02.455
possession, I should say, or my own

17:03.415 --> 17:08.665
misunderstandings? Why do I accept wrong things?”

17:11.505 --> 17:13.505
Once you’ll start seeing that,

17:13.705 --> 17:16.705
and if you find even a wee bit of such

17:17.415 --> 17:20.255
nonsensical understanding within you,

17:20.665 --> 17:23.335
then you can forgive also people

17:23.585 --> 17:27.375
who have been absolutely brainwashed,

17:28.625 --> 17:30.795
absolutely brainwashed,

17:31.545 --> 17:35.665
and they did everything under that influence.

17:39.505 --> 17:42.585
As it is now you have risen much higher

17:43.625 --> 17:46.295
than all these people,

17:47.705 --> 17:53.375
and much more aware than all of them.

17:54.755 --> 17:59.295
So you have to just understand this point,

17:59.665 --> 18:04.295
and then you can forgive all the mistakes they have committed.

18:07.455 --> 18:13.415
And for the people who are actually bad,

18:14.705 --> 18:16.705
you don’t have to worry.

18:17.705 --> 18:22.505
That’s the work of the divine Power to destroy them.

18:25.295 --> 18:28.505
But watch yourself and see for yourself

18:29.455 --> 18:35.705
if you have any of such ideas, any lingering idea.

18:39.255 --> 18:42.625
You should try to cleanse the mirror

18:43.295 --> 18:48.545
so you see your complete image

18:50.255 --> 18:55.375
and try, you can then try to cleanse it.

18:58.295 --> 19:03.455
It’s very important that you should cleanse yourself.

19:09.705 --> 19:15.585
There are people who have done lots of wrong things.

19:16.665 --> 19:19.255
I simply pity them.

19:20.295 --> 19:24.795
If they have done wrong things, it is their responsibility

19:25.415 --> 19:27.415
to see what they have been doing.

19:27.755 --> 19:29.585
Why have they been doing like that?

19:31.545 --> 19:33.625
What is the need to do that?

19:37.455 --> 19:42.795
All this introspection will work out so well.

19:44.295 --> 19:46.545
Then your real powers will come out

19:47.755 --> 19:54.505
– your powers of giving realization,

19:56.415 --> 20:03.415
your powers to understand the problems of your country,

20:05.505 --> 20:08.585
of the whole world.

20:09.415 --> 20:14.795
And once you feel that you are the soldier to fight it out,

20:15.625 --> 20:18.455
you have the responsibility to fight it out,

20:19.505 --> 20:21.625
then things will work out.

20:22.255 --> 20:27.585
We cannot leave everything to the divine Power.

20:29.295 --> 20:34.835
You have to use the divine Power, and you have to work it out

20:35.335 --> 20:39.295
because you are the soldiers of divine Power.

20:41.335 --> 20:48.665
Of course, with that beautiful idea

20:49.795 --> 20:56.415
we start cleansing ourselves. You need not know everything

20:57.585 --> 21:00.915
as to what things are happening and how they are happening,

21:01.375 --> 21:04.915
how they are working out. That’s not your work.

21:05.955 --> 21:10.415
You are a soldier so you have to just fight,

21:10.955 --> 21:15.375
fight the ignorance – your own and of others.

21:16.625 --> 21:21.375
Because mostly soldiers fail when they have their egos.

21:23.295 --> 21:29.955
When they fail, they have other obstacles in their minds.

21:30.705 --> 21:36.795
There should be no obstacle, but you should just  push forward

21:38.455 --> 21:41.295
and know there’s no obstacle at all.

21:42.295 --> 21:45.875
It’s just a myth that there are some obstacles

21:46.455 --> 21:48.415
and that you cannot do it.

21:51.955 --> 21:56.585
It’s not easy to raise the awareness of people,

21:57.585 --> 22:02.505
because looks there’s a very little distance

22:02.875 --> 22:08.415
of crossing over, but it’s not so – it’s not.

22:08.665 --> 22:11.835
It is a very difficult task sometimes

22:12.585 --> 22:20.455
for some people to get out of the bandhans of Agnya.

22:21.955 --> 22:25.915
At that point I find some of you fail.

22:27.585 --> 22:31.455
And for that, best thing is to introspect.

22:32.835 --> 22:36.335
When you think you are always correct and you are all right,

22:36.795 --> 22:40.585
it’s best is to introspect,

22:41.955 --> 22:44.955
“Am I doing everything right?

22:46.455 --> 22:51.795
How am I working for my betterment?”

22:53.415 --> 22:55.545
The illusion is such

22:56.295 --> 22:58.505
that sometimes you think you are doing very well.

22:58.795 --> 23:02.625
Say, in our Sahaja Yoga some people are very forward type;

23:02.795 --> 23:05.375
they’ll come forward, they’ll do this, do that.

23:06.625 --> 23:12.375
But inside, what is the purpose?  The purpose is that

23:12.625 --> 23:15.455
people should see that you are doing this work, that work.

23:18.585 --> 23:19.755
The purpose should be

23:19.915 --> 23:22.665
that you should be able to see yourself within.

23:23.835 --> 23:28.415
You must see what is the problem inside,

23:31.665 --> 23:34.955
and you can very well understand

23:36.415 --> 23:42.255
that you have been of great help to yourself and to others.

23:43.955 --> 23:50.295
For example, there’s a very big building,

23:52.755 --> 23:57.335
and all the buildings in the nearby area

23:57.665 --> 24:02.625
may fall down due to earthquake, but this one building

24:03.585 --> 24:09.585
which will be standing erect. The reason is that that building

24:10.335 --> 24:13.915
is constructed on very solid grounds.

24:15.255 --> 24:16.455
In the same way

24:16.625 --> 24:19.835
if Sahaja Yoga is constructed on a very sound wall,

24:20.795 --> 24:25.705
nobody can destroy it, nobody can distort it;

24:26.625 --> 24:29.665
and every person has to do that.

24:30.875 --> 24:32.875
For example, some people told Me,

24:33.255 --> 24:35.665
“Your Sahaja yogis, you know, are like this, and that

24:35.955 --> 24:38.415
they are big show-offs and that.”

24:39.585 --> 24:43.705
I said, “Really? I can’t believe it

24:44.835 --> 24:47.915
that they could be like that.

24:48.835 --> 24:52.585
” I said, “I would like to meet them, whosoever they are.”

25:01.505 --> 25:05.915
So they said, “No, You can find them out Yourself

25:06.585 --> 25:10.955
who are those people and why they behave like that.”

25:12.375 --> 25:15.835
I said, “Myself I know everything,

25:17.625 --> 25:20.415
but I want you to know everything.”

25:21.955 --> 25:26.955
Finding faults with others is a very nice thing, very easy also

25:27.705 --> 25:30.665
– but find out faults within yourself.

25:32.505 --> 25:35.335
What are these things that are strangling us?

25:39.755 --> 25:45.955
This is the best way of improving your awareness.

25:46.955 --> 25:54.415
Like you are going in the car and you have to know the road,

25:56.335 --> 25:59.375
you have to know how you are driving,

25:59.835 --> 26:02.545
you have to see what are the problems.

26:03.665 --> 26:06.705
But instead of you think, oh, no end of yourself

26:07.795 --> 26:09.795
– it won’t work out.

26:11.415 --> 26:16.625
Today is a day of very great happening, I should say.

26:16.955 --> 26:21.585
Celebrating the Diwali is a very, very

26:24.755 --> 26:26.835
joyous thing.

26:28.835 --> 26:35.415
But this joy is not for ourselves;

26:35.705 --> 26:38.375
this joy is for the whole world.

26:39.295 --> 26:41.955
We have to work for the whole world.

26:42.665 --> 26:47.915
We work for ourselves, for our jobs, for our money, whatever it is,

26:48.835 --> 26:53.295
but what are you doing for others?

26:54.545 --> 26:57.375
That you should see for yourself,

26:57.915 --> 27:04.705
that’s very important. Only such people are useful in Sahaja Yoga

27:06.455 --> 27:10.795
because they have concern, they have care,

27:11.295 --> 27:13.755
and they are doing something for others.

27:15.455 --> 27:20.255
It’s a great enjoyment with that, when the lights are burning,

27:22.295 --> 27:26.625
it’s to give you happiness; they are burning their bodies

27:27.335 --> 27:32.375
to give you happiness. They are the ones who should teach us

27:32.665 --> 27:35.585
that we have to do something ourselves

27:36.505 --> 27:40.755
to enjoy our own higher awareness.

27:43.295 --> 27:49.875
All this will work out, I am sure. I am also trying My best

27:51.705 --> 27:57.665
to make this light unshaky

27:59.705 --> 28:04.255
and full of enthusiasm.

28:05.705 --> 28:11.415
It’s there. It is you who are

28:12.375 --> 28:16.835
anxious to fill your pitchers.

28:17.875 --> 28:20.505
You can do it.

28:22.375 --> 28:26.625
It’s not My anxiety that’s going to help you.

28:27.875 --> 28:31.665
So you’ll start, and even if you want to have

28:34.705 --> 28:37.415
complete picture about yourself,

28:38.835 --> 28:45.295
you have to first give up identification with yourself;

28:47.335 --> 28:50.955
otherwise you’ll never know what’s wrong with you.

28:51.755 --> 28:55.755
If you are too much identified with you, you cannot come up.

28:57.625 --> 29:01.915
Now as it is, what is the aim after all,

29:02.795 --> 29:05.915
what is the aim of our lives?

29:08.375 --> 29:14.915
We have to change the whole world into a peaceful theme.

29:18.705 --> 29:21.755
Changing yourself, of course, is great thing, no doubt;

29:22.505 --> 29:28.875
but changing others also will stop all the problems of the world.

29:29.625 --> 29:33.665
If all the people of this world become good people, Sahaja yogis,

29:34.665 --> 29:37.255
then can you imagine what will happen?

29:37.665 --> 29:39.795
Think of that dream I have,

29:40.585 --> 29:47.415
that we have to change each and every person that we can change,

29:48.415 --> 29:52.455
and we have to transform them into good people.

29:53.875 --> 29:55.415
If they are not transformed

29:55.545 --> 29:57.955
they are like a candle without any flame in it.

29:58.705 --> 30:03.505
And if they are capable of getting transformed,

30:04.255 --> 30:10.955
we should try all methods, all the tricks to do that.

30:12.665 --> 30:16.625
I’m sure very soon such a day will come when you will say,

30:17.415 --> 30:19.795
“Mother, now we are very safe.”

30:23.625 --> 30:27.255
Don’t think of the past and the problems of the past

30:27.755 --> 30:30.255
– you have now overcome it.

30:30.795 --> 30:35.335
Just enjoy yourself and have faith in yourself,

30:35.625 --> 30:42.255
and work it out. I am sure very soon it will happen,

30:42.665 --> 30:49.255
very quickly it will happen. It is your desire, also

30:52.955 --> 30:55.415
your method of working it out,

30:55.795 --> 30:57.955
your anxiety to work it out.

30:58.505 --> 31:02.665
Main anxiety should be, “How can I transform this person?”

31:05.915 --> 31:07.755
You can transform anyone.

31:08.795 --> 31:11.665
You know, you tell one person, another person follows it.

31:12.545 --> 31:14.625
Like when we came in the plane,

31:15.625 --> 31:18.505
I found at the airport so many people

31:18.755 --> 31:21.335
had put up their hands towards Me like this.

31:21.665 --> 31:25.415
I said, “Who are these people?” They were not Sahaja yogis.

31:26.415 --> 31:31.295
They had seen somebody, or what had happened I couldn’t ask them,

31:32.295 --> 31:35.295
but all of them said, “We are feeling the cool breeze in the hand.

31:35.915 --> 31:37.835
” They didn’t know anything about it,

31:38.255 --> 31:40.455
they didn’t know about kundalini, nothing.

31:40.625 --> 31:42.625
Then what is this cool coming?

31:43.585 --> 31:48.415
That basically they are there to get their realization,

31:49.375 --> 31:52.335
only we have to extend our ideals,

31:52.585 --> 31:55.835
we have to extend our love to them.

31:57.835 --> 32:00.835
Instead of getting annoyed with them,

32:01.665 --> 32:04.455
better is to give them a chance

32:05.545 --> 32:11.625
and you’ll be amazed that they are very anxious to get transformed.

32:12.415 --> 32:16.955
They’re all fed up with all the artificial things they’re having.

32:18.295 --> 32:21.705
It’s over now. You will be amazed

32:21.915 --> 32:26.705
how many are waiting there for you to give them Self-realization

32:27.375 --> 32:32.665
and let them celebrate their Diwali with you, enjoy the Diwali.

32:36.795 --> 32:40.295
Diwali you cannot celebrate with one candle.

32:41.665 --> 32:44.665
You have to have more and more of candles,

32:45.415 --> 32:47.545
and that’s what is your job.

32:48.295 --> 32:51.795
Only by your own candle you are going to do it; it’s your own,

32:53.755 --> 32:58.795
and it can enlighten anyone. Then why not use it,

33:00.665 --> 33:02.875
at any cost, at any place?

33:05.915 --> 33:09.625
I have met some Sahaja yogis.

33:11.625 --> 33:15.295
I asked them, “What did you do?”

33:15.915 --> 33:17.625
They said, “No, nothing.”

33:18.505 --> 33:20.295
“Nothing? You did nothing?”

33:21.375 --> 33:22.505
“No, nothing.”

33:23.755 --> 33:26.955
Then what’s the use of getting realization?

33:28.295 --> 33:29.875
If you have done nothing,

33:30.705 --> 33:33.455
you don’t want to give realization to anyone,

33:33.795 --> 33:37.915
don’t want to talk to anyone, you feel so shy about it?

33:39.505 --> 33:43.335
Then I met some who said, “Just now, Mother,

33:44.415 --> 33:48.625
we are coming from a program.”

33:50.335 --> 33:51.835
“How are you so late?”

33:52.915 --> 33:56.545
“Because they told us there’s a bomb scare.”

33:56.955 --> 33:59.375
“So you were waiting outside?”

33:59.505 --> 34:00.705
“Yes.” “How many?”

34:00.875 --> 34:04.415
“All of us.  Thousands were waiting.

34:04.755 --> 34:07.545
There was no bomb, they said there’s no bomb.

34:07.835 --> 34:10.505
So we went inside and we all got realization.”

34:10.875 --> 34:12.875
“But you were realized souls?”

34:13.505 --> 34:15.665
“No, we had our realization,

34:15.955 --> 34:18.705
that sometimes we have to wait too.

34:19.955 --> 34:23.375
And now we are convinced that nobody can harm us,

34:23.915 --> 34:27.455
nobody can trouble us, overpower us.

34:27.665 --> 34:29.795
Only we do it to ourselves.”

34:30.415 --> 34:33.255
So again I will say introspection

34:33.665 --> 34:36.665
is very, very important in Sahaja Yoga.

34:37.375 --> 34:41.705
When the light inside is there, you have to look after it.

34:44.255 --> 34:49.705
I was extremely happy to hear from many people

34:50.835 --> 34:56.625
that they felt the blessings of Diwali.

34:58.505 --> 35:02.755
But you see, yesterday you had these showers

35:03.455 --> 35:07.255
– how timely they were! It never happened,

35:07.875 --> 35:11.545
in the history of this world it never happened;

35:11.705 --> 35:16.705
why yesterday these showers came in and tried to

35:17.665 --> 35:21.455
give a new experience of the showers?

35:22.455 --> 35:25.665
All this is a time, we should say,

35:26.415 --> 35:33.255
that even the nature knows and we should also know,

35:33.955 --> 35:37.705
that this is the time for a special thing.

35:39.625 --> 35:41.755
Normally I get letters

35:42.625 --> 35:47.335
about people who are sick and their parents are sick or their ...

35:47.665 --> 35:49.625
this is sick, all kinds of things.

35:50.375 --> 35:52.705
Then somebody’s marriage is broken;

35:53.335 --> 35:56.755
then somebody has children, they are sick –

35:57.375 --> 36:01.795
??? all kinds of nonsensical problems, they do it.

36:03.625 --> 36:04.755
The reason is they

36:04.915 --> 36:07.375
themselves, those who write are not realized souls,

36:07.795 --> 36:10.625
or maybe they are halfway,

36:11.455 --> 36:13.415
because they could themself say

36:13.625 --> 36:15.505
that “Why should we write to Mother?

36:16.335 --> 36:18.665
We can get it done ourselves.”

36:20.415 --> 36:23.335
Instead of that, one has to write

36:23.835 --> 36:27.295
what they have achieved, how they have achieved very much,

36:27.625 --> 36:31.415
how they have got love from others,

36:32.335 --> 36:36.705
how they have worked out Sahaja Yoga in small villages.

36:37.705 --> 36:39.835
All this is much better to write,

36:40.415 --> 36:43.705
than to write, “My mother is sick, my father is sick.”

36:44.335 --> 36:49.625
All these relationships, they go on killing you.

36:50.665 --> 36:53.705
So no more is your brother, nobody is your sister;

36:55.415 --> 36:58.585
only Sahaja yogis are your brothers and sisters.

36:59.625 --> 37:03.415
Now you have some cousin and it’s cousin’s cousin and....

37:03.705 --> 37:07.705
So let it be. That’s not your job,

37:08.705 --> 37:10.705
you don’t have to work it out.

37:11.295 --> 37:14.705
Even before coming I got letters like that:

37:15.665 --> 37:18.545
somebody cousin’s cousin’s ... this thing.

37:19.375 --> 37:22.455
So I asked this lady, I said,

37:22.835 --> 37:25.545
“Why do you write all these things

37:25.955 --> 37:29.255
all the time about this cousin and that cousin?”

37:29.585 --> 37:32.335
She says, “Mother, I am trying to spread Sahaja Yoga.”

37:32.505 --> 37:33.705
“How?”

37:33.915 --> 37:37.955
“Because if they’ll be cured, then they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga.”

37:38.795 --> 37:41.875
This is not the way we want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

37:42.795 --> 37:46.335
This looks like advertising or something,

37:46.585 --> 37:49.955
speciality that you should cure somebody,

37:50.415 --> 37:52.795
then some people will come to Sahaja Yoga.

37:53.455 --> 37:55.955
We just don’t want such people to come.

37:57.585 --> 38:01.755
I don’t want to hurt, but I want to give you courage

38:02.295 --> 38:05.415
and understanding, and the wisdom.

38:06.375 --> 38:08.665
What, why are we Sahaja yogis here

38:08.875 --> 38:12.835
– just to cure all the relations of ours?

38:14.295 --> 38:17.755
They may be sick because of some mistakes they have committed.

38:18.955 --> 38:22.335
Instead of paying attention to all these such people,

38:23.295 --> 38:28.835
you should pay attention to yourself and to your ascent.

38:29.415 --> 38:30.875
You have to respect yourself.

38:31.915 --> 38:35.295
If you are their relation, it’s none of your business.

38:36.755 --> 38:40.545
Like understanding,

38:41.505 --> 38:47.955
wisdom that we have come here for a

38:48.455 --> 38:52.955
very,  very special work of very high quality:

38:54.585 --> 38:59.505
that is not there. Then all such people write to Me.

39:00.415 --> 39:03.335
Now one lady got married in Sahaja Yoga

39:04.835 --> 39:08.705
and she wrote to Me that “I was divorced

39:09.835 --> 39:12.755
about eight months back or nine months back, whatever it is.

39:13.875 --> 39:16.625
And all my relations are now saying,

39:16.875 --> 39:19.705
‘Why did you marry in Sahaja Yoga?’

39:19.955 --> 39:23.505
And everybody is criticizing me and Sahaja Yoga.”

39:25.295 --> 39:29.705
I said, “Who asked her to marry?” I never asked her.

39:30.915 --> 39:34.255
So now the marriage has become the main point for her,

39:34.705 --> 39:37.625
that “all my family people are saying ...

39:37.755 --> 39:39.915
” What did they do for Sahaja Yoga?

39:42.335 --> 39:44.585
If this marriage doesn’t become

39:44.875 --> 39:46.665
all right, then they will say there’s

39:46.835 --> 39:48.835
something wrong with Sahaja Yoga. Let them say.

39:51.875 --> 39:55.455
We have not committed that way.

39:57.915 --> 40:01.455
Every time I have told you that don’t write to Me for your mother,

40:01.625 --> 40:02.665
father, this, that.

40:04.455 --> 40:07.295
If you don’t know how to cure them, better give up Sahaja Yoga.

40:09.415 --> 40:11.705
You yourself can cure them

40:13.335 --> 40:15.585
you can work it out yourself.

40:16.505 --> 40:20.585
But you should see it, so many letters every day for Me.

40:23.755 --> 40:26.415
I ask them, “Is your father in Sahaja Yoga?”

40:26.625 --> 40:27.625
“Mother?" " No.”

40:27.915 --> 40:30.255
“Brother?” “No, nobody.”

40:30.955 --> 40:36.255
So why are you asking Me?

40:36.915 --> 40:39.415
What relationship I have with them?

40:40.255 --> 40:43.705
They’re not Sahaja yogis. I am only responsible for Sahaja yogis.

40:44.755 --> 40:48.665
They are not Sahaja yogis, so why do you want to trouble Me?

40:50.585 --> 40:53.295
It is impossible to understand.

40:54.955 --> 40:58.875
In Sahaja Yoga you are supposed to get Self-realization, all right.

40:59.955 --> 41:05.255
Then those who want to have Self-realization,

41:05.705 --> 41:09.375
you can give them and fix them properly.

41:09.915 --> 41:13.875
But instead of that somebody who is hanging in the air

41:14.545 --> 41:18.335
and who is falling from the airport to some other place,

41:18.505 --> 41:19.875
all kinds of things

41:20.585 --> 41:25.455
– all this is really maddening, and is sickening.

41:26.455 --> 41:30.455
I’m not concerned; you should not be concerned also.

41:30.875 --> 41:33.335
What you should do is to see

41:34.505 --> 41:37.835
that these people who're talking about it should come to Sahaja Yoga

41:39.625 --> 41:40.755
And you must tell them,

41:40.915 --> 41:44.335
“Because you are not doing Sahaja Yoga, that’s why it is like that”

41:46.295 --> 41:48.295
or “That person is not doing Sahaja Yoga,

41:48.415 --> 41:51.415
that’s why this is the problem is. We are all right, we are happy"

41:53.755 --> 41:56.505
Because Sahaja Yoga is an open thing,

41:57.835 --> 41:59.955
so everybody comes there.

42:01.375 --> 42:03.795
I would request you on a Diwali day

42:04.295 --> 42:08.755
to promise to yourself, “I will not waste my energy

42:09.295 --> 42:11.545
on people who are not Sahaja yogis.

42:15.415 --> 42:16.915
” It’s very important,

42:17.875 --> 42:20.955
because all the time the attention is on wrong things

42:23.915 --> 42:25.795
and on wrong basis.

42:26.955 --> 42:29.335
If you have some intelligence

42:29.665 --> 42:32.755
you must know that now you belong

42:33.705 --> 42:40.625
to a very high-quality spiritual people,

42:42.415 --> 42:46.835
which are very few. In this world

42:48.375 --> 42:53.705
they are very few, and you must make a concentrated effort

42:54.915 --> 43:00.875
to see that this quality

43:02.755 --> 43:04.955
must be in so many people,

43:05.545 --> 43:08.955
and there must be lots of aspiration about it.

43:09.625 --> 43:12.835
Find out such people, tell them

43:13.455 --> 43:15.795
you have found it – “you can also get it.”

43:17.585 --> 43:20.835
But don’t worry about things

43:21.295 --> 43:23.915
which are of no value to us.

43:24.955 --> 43:27.335
You must know you are a special race.

43:28.585 --> 43:30.625
You are special soldiers

43:31.625 --> 43:36.705
who have been trained

43:38.415 --> 43:40.455
for doing Sahaj work only.

43:42.755 --> 43:45.665
So wasting energy on your relations

43:45.795 --> 43:49.835
and brothers and sisters is no good for you.

43:53.545 --> 43:55.665
It is to be understood now

43:57.335 --> 44:01.875
that you have your own energy reserved

44:03.545 --> 44:07.585
– for what? For Sahaja yogis only.

44:10.255 --> 44:15.295
You should help everyone

44:15.665 --> 44:18.455
who is a Sahaja yogi

44:18.625 --> 44:20.955
or who wants to become a Sahaja yogi.

44:22.795 --> 44:25.455
Who are established Sahaja yogis,

44:25.955 --> 44:29.915
you must help them; because we are one Personality

44:31.625 --> 44:34.625
and these are all the different hands

44:35.955 --> 44:39.415
of one Personality, one God.

44:41.585 --> 44:45.505
So this oneness must be established

44:46.455 --> 44:52.875
within yourself, and also others should see that oneness in you.

44:55.755 --> 44:58.415
There are some people who are very active.

44:59.455 --> 45:04.375
There are some people who are very active in criticizing.

45:09.665 --> 45:12.335
All that will work out, I’m sure,

45:12.625 --> 45:18.545
because this is the year of great achievements and great success;

45:19.545 --> 45:23.665
but with that if you start doing something nonsensical,

45:24.455 --> 45:26.545
nothing will work out.

45:30.955 --> 45:34.625
Of course, I don’t say that we haven’t got such Sahaja yogis

45:34.795 --> 45:39.545
with us – we have. We have all the soldiers with us, no doubt.

45:40.295 --> 45:43.915
All the armament they have, everything they have;

45:44.665 --> 45:46.505
but we need more.

45:47.915 --> 45:51.915
And for that we have to work out collectively,

45:52.915 --> 45:55.585
must plan what should we do.

45:57.585 --> 46:00.755
Recently there has been a big

46:02.545 --> 46:06.545
argument about the Islamic behavior of people.

46:07.665 --> 46:11.375
We are neither Christians nor Islamic nor anything.

46:12.915 --> 46:20.415
We are not; because you cannot put yourself into a small

46:21.375 --> 46:24.955
arena, saying, “I am a Sahaja yogi, but I am a Christian.”

46:25.835 --> 46:29.915
You cannot.  You haveto give up that margin.

46:30.705 --> 46:33.375
You are a Sahaja yogi out and out,

46:33.915 --> 46:37.955
and all the other nonsensical things are not belonging to you.

46:40.625 --> 46:43.665
I have seen many Muslims also come to Sahaja Yoga,

46:45.255 --> 46:48.505
but out of them very few are real Sahaja yogis.

46:49.625 --> 46:52.705
But they’ll come, listen to My lecture, this, that.

46:53.455 --> 46:59.795
But very few are really Sahaja yogis in the real sense of the word.

47:01.455 --> 47:05.875
Then you will start seeing the defects of your community

47:06.625 --> 47:11.875
of so-called religion you belong to, whatever it is you will see.

47:12.545 --> 47:17.875
And you will definitely try to correct it,

47:18.415 --> 47:19.915
if you love them

47:21.335 --> 47:23.505
– or you give up.

47:24.955 --> 47:28.915
These are special people, specially selected

47:29.755 --> 47:31.755
for a very special cause,

47:32.255 --> 47:36.375
and you cannot waste your energy on small, nonsensical things.

47:36.955 --> 47:39.545
That is one thing you should know.

47:40.505 --> 47:42.795
On this Diwali day you have to know

47:43.545 --> 47:46.455
that you have to burn yourself

47:47.335 --> 47:53.795
for the light of the Divine to absolutely spread all over.

47:56.625 --> 47:58.915
But don’t do it too much.

47:59.375 --> 48:01.585
Like some people came and told Me,

48:01.915 --> 48:04.545
“Mother, we have given up our parents,

48:04.665 --> 48:06.875
we have given up this,  we have given up that.

48:07.545 --> 48:09.545
Still we are not good.”

48:09.955 --> 48:12.625
So I said, “Why should you give up?

48:13.415 --> 48:16.625
You are catching onto something, then you are giving up?

48:17.335 --> 48:20.295
Or automatically it’s just finished?”

48:20.705 --> 48:25.755
“Ah, we were, you see, very much attached to our family, parents,

48:26.505 --> 48:31.625
country, this, that, and now we have given up some – but some.”

48:33.295 --> 48:36.255
Such half-baked people are no good,

48:37.625 --> 48:40.375
and don’t pay too much attention to them.

48:41.415 --> 48:43.625
They don’t deserve any attention.

48:44.955 --> 48:49.455
That is very much to be understood,

48:50.335 --> 48:52.455
that you should not be also like that,

48:52.955 --> 48:55.665
nor you should have friends like that,.

48:55.835 --> 48:58.875
nor you should make them Sahaja yogis

48:59.705 --> 49:03.375
Sahaja yogi is a special character

49:03.585 --> 49:07.335
of a soldier who fights for the truth.

49:09.835 --> 49:15.835
That kind of a personality when you will have,

49:17.755 --> 49:20.505
there will be lights all over.

49:23.755 --> 49:28.505
This Diwali day I bless you all from My heart,

49:30.375 --> 49:33.375
and I want you to respect yourself

49:34.415 --> 49:38.375
and understand what is the position of

49:38.755 --> 49:41.295
your being in this

49:44.755 --> 49:49.795
organization,  we can call, or in this movement of Sahaja Yoga.

49:51.955 --> 49:54.705
And how are we working it out?

49:55.455 --> 49:57.505
The attention should move from

49:57.795 --> 50:01.705
all this nonsensical, mundane things to yourself.

50:03.505 --> 50:07.335
It should be a very dynamic force that should work out.

50:09.955 --> 50:13.455
And I’m sure next year it would be very different.

50:14.665 --> 50:20.505
We’ll have all the beautiful blessings of the Divine.

50:22.455 --> 50:25.415
We must do it collectively, understandingly.

50:25.955 --> 50:27.585
May God bless you.
