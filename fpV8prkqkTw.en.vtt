00:00:08.572 --> 00:00:15.233
We have to understand that we have risen above our human awareness

00:00:15.612 --> 00:00:23.626
and at that level we were different and at 
this new awareness we are different people

00:00:23.746 --> 00:00:26.872
and all our priorities must change.

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:31.913
Our value system has to change, and if it has not changed automatically

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:35.184
we have to little bit deliberately work it out.

00:00:35.304 --> 00:00:40.151
Or else we have to see that we become really the Spirit

00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:47.040
and no more of all the falsehood of human awareness should be attached to us

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.594
or we should be bothered about it.

00:00:49.714 --> 00:00:56.069
The, if you see, the principle of everything, 
as I see, the principle of everything,

00:00:56.189 --> 00:01:04.496
rather human endeavor, whatever it is, it is based on gathering property.

00:01:04.616 --> 00:01:11.858
Whether it is communism, or it is democracy or socialism or anything,

00:01:11.978 --> 00:01:17.410
it’s all going round and round to the point of property.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.784
Property, that may be land, that may be money, that may be anything.

00:01:21.904 --> 00:01:27.473
All economic activity surrounds that one point, is property.

00:01:27.593 --> 00:01:34.530
So the democracy, though it’s a political organization or political theory,

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.545
actually is based on something very economic, economical thing called property.

00:01:40.665 --> 00:01:45.421
Then, same about communism, we can say; it’s the same thing,

00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:50.264
to, how to distribute the property, how to have the property equally,

00:01:50.384 --> 00:01:56.418
how to make everybody self-sufficient.

00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:01.418
But as soon as you become a realized soul,

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:07.730
you have to know that your properties and your priorities are very different.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.516
Your property is your Spirit and your priorities are

00:02:13.636 --> 00:02:19.276
where you can manifest your Spirit and can feel the Spirit of others.

00:02:19.396 --> 00:02:25.130
So the whole concept that was so far obstructing you

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.255
and limiting your understanding

00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:35.483
changes into an unlimited area where you start thinking of the Spirit.

00:02:35.603 --> 00:02:43.792
Now in that concept of the Spirit, the property of the Spirit is twofold.

00:02:43.912 --> 00:02:49.839
One in its nature, the nature of the Spirit is, as we call it, sat chit ananada,

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.802
means it is the joy.

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.658
Then it’s the truth. It tells you the truth all the times.

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:01.868
It gives you discretion, divine discretion,

00:03:01.988 --> 00:03:10.653
and chit, the attention that acts, that 
works, that gives you all the information.

00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:17.976
So you have got the nature of the Spirit thus felt within yourself.

00:03:18.096 --> 00:03:23.967
But on the other side, what does it want or what are its duties

00:03:24.087 --> 00:03:28.736
or why to be the Spirit is?

00:03:29.216 --> 00:03:37.094
Such questions arise later on when we 
are about to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:03:37.214 --> 00:03:39.698
Why to enter into the Kingdom of God?

00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:46.393
So in outside and, we can say, all the manifestations of the Spirit is,

00:03:46.513 --> 00:03:53.209
that it is benevolent. It is hita cari.

00:03:53.702 --> 00:03:57.829
It gives benevolence to others.

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:01.833
It gives you benevolence and it gives benevolence to others, also.

00:04:01.953 --> 00:04:05.900
The only joy in that is benevolence.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:12.798
And you think of all these material things, which are so important otherwise,

00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:19.088
as if they are for giving it to someone just to express your love.

00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:23.366
So the benevolence that comes through love,

00:04:23.486 --> 00:04:30.560
benevolence doesn’t come through oppression or suppression or by intimidation

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.194
but it comes only through love,

00:04:33.314 --> 00:04:36.827
and if you have faith in your love you can work it out.

00:04:36.947 --> 00:04:45.960
Everybody has his own role to play, everybody has his own style to work out,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.514
but it has to be for the benevolence of the whole and not of an individual.

00:04:52.634 --> 00:04:56.589
Once you realize that, such a person becomes extremely humble,

00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:00.852
extremely conducive and he can articulate

00:05:00.972 --> 00:05:03.206
in a very beautiful manner with other people

00:05:03.326 --> 00:05:09.498
and you never feel that he is your boss but you feel he is your father.

00:05:09.618 --> 00:05:12.673
He’s looking after you with love and affection,

00:05:12.793 --> 00:05:17.976
but in that love there’s no expectation at all, except that of giving.

00:05:18.096 --> 00:05:23.511
And this giving is the most beautiful thing Sahaja yogis can do.
