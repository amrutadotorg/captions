WEBVTT

00:08.572 --> 00:15.233
We have to understand that we have risen above our human awareness

00:15.612 --> 00:23.626
and at that level we were different and at
this new awareness we are different people

00:23.746 --> 00:26.872
and all our priorities must change.

00:26.992 --> 00:31.913
Our value system has to change, and if it has not changed automatically

00:32.033 --> 00:35.184
we have to little bit deliberately work it out.

00:35.304 --> 00:40.151
Or else we have to see that we become really the Spirit

00:40.271 --> 00:47.040
and no more of all the falsehood of human awareness should be attached to us

00:47.160 --> 00:49.594
or we should be bothered about it.

00:49.714 --> 00:56.069
The, if you see, the principle of everything,
as I see, the principle of everything,

00:56.189 --> 01:04.496
rather human endeavor, whatever it is, it is based on gathering property.

01:04.616 --> 01:11.858
Whether it is communism, or it is democracy or socialism or anything,

01:11.978 --> 01:17.410
it’s all going round and round to the point of property.

01:17.530 --> 01:21.784
Property, that may be land, that may be money, that may be anything.

01:21.904 --> 01:27.473
All economic activity surrounds that one point, is property.

01:27.593 --> 01:34.530
So the democracy, though it’s a political organization or political theory,

01:34.650 --> 01:40.545
actually is based on something very economic, economical thing called property.

01:40.665 --> 01:45.421
Then, same about communism, we can say; it’s the same thing,

01:45.541 --> 01:50.264
to, how to distribute the property, how to have the property equally,

01:50.384 --> 01:56.418
how to make everybody self-sufficient.

01:57.951 --> 02:01.418
But as soon as you become a realized soul,

02:01.538 --> 02:07.730
you have to know that your properties and your priorities are very different.

02:07.850 --> 02:13.516
Your property is your Spirit and your priorities are

02:13.636 --> 02:19.276
where you can manifest your Spirit and can feel the Spirit of others.

02:19.396 --> 02:25.130
So the whole concept that was so far obstructing you

02:25.250 --> 02:29.255
and limiting your understanding

02:29.375 --> 02:35.483
changes into an unlimited area where you start thinking of the Spirit.

02:35.603 --> 02:43.792
Now in that concept of the Spirit, the property of the Spirit is twofold.

02:43.912 --> 02:49.839
One in its nature, the nature of the Spirit is, as we call it, sat chit ananada,

02:49.959 --> 02:52.802
means it is the joy.

02:53.769 --> 02:58.658
Then it’s the truth. It tells you the truth all the times.

02:58.778 --> 03:01.868
It gives you discretion, divine discretion,

03:01.988 --> 03:10.653
and chit, the attention that acts, that
works, that gives you all the information.

03:10.773 --> 03:17.976
So you have got the nature of the Spirit thus felt within yourself.

03:18.096 --> 03:23.967
But on the other side, what does it want or what are its duties

03:24.087 --> 03:28.736
or why to be the Spirit is?

03:29.216 --> 03:37.094
Such questions arise later on when we
are about to enter into the Kingdom of God.

03:37.214 --> 03:39.698
Why to enter into the Kingdom of God?

03:39.818 --> 03:46.393
So in outside and, we can say, all the manifestations of the Spirit is,

03:46.513 --> 03:53.209
that it is benevolent. It is hita cari.

03:53.702 --> 03:57.829
It gives benevolence to others.

03:57.949 --> 04:01.833
It gives you benevolence and it gives benevolence to others, also.

04:01.953 --> 04:05.900
The only joy in that is benevolence.

04:06.020 --> 04:12.798
And you think of all these material things, which are so important otherwise,

04:12.918 --> 04:19.088
as if they are for giving it to someone just to express your love.

04:19.208 --> 04:23.366
So the benevolence that comes through love,

04:23.486 --> 04:30.560
benevolence doesn’t come through oppression or suppression or by intimidation

04:30.680 --> 04:33.194
but it comes only through love,

04:33.314 --> 04:36.827
and if you have faith in your love you can work it out.

04:36.947 --> 04:45.960
Everybody has his own role to play, everybody has his own style to work out,

04:46.080 --> 04:52.514
but it has to be for the benevolence of the whole and not of an individual.

04:52.634 --> 04:56.589
Once you realize that, such a person becomes extremely humble,

04:56.709 --> 05:00.852
extremely conducive and he can articulate

05:00.972 --> 05:03.206
in a very beautiful manner with other people

05:03.326 --> 05:09.498
and you never feel that he is your boss but you feel he is your father.

05:09.618 --> 05:12.673
He’s looking after you with love and affection,

05:12.793 --> 05:17.976
but in that love there’s no expectation at all, except that of giving.

05:18.096 --> 05:23.511
And this giving is the most beautiful thing Sahaja yogis can do.
