1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.160
So, I walked in this room and everything is blue.

2
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.880
The floor is blue, the carpets are blue.

3
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:31.880
And when I was once in my garden in Kathmandu with Shri Mataji,

4
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.240
I was looking at Shri Mataji,

5
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:47.000
and then the shape of the garden started shivering around her.

6
00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:00.360
And then I saw someone sitting and I saw a face there where she was.

7
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:08.000
And it's very, very hard to describe.

8
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.960
Because it was so beautiful.

9
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.440
And there was such a purity.

10
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:28.040
The purity was the beauty.

11
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.160
And it was an unbearable beauty.

12
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.880
After some time I could not look because I said I was not pure enough to look.

13
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:53.560
Because if we are in front of someone who is absolutely pure,

14
00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:05.520
then our own impurity comes out.

15
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.440
Because of the light and the force of the purity.

16
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:19.200
So, and this face was actually was blue.

17
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.040
It was lavender blue.

18
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.640
So, I looked at the ground because I could not look anymore.

19
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.920
Then I looked up again.

20
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.560
And then Shri Mataji was sitting there in my garden.

21
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.320
And then I told Shri Mataji what happened.

22
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:54.040
And she said it was probably Shri Krishna.

23
00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.160
So, it was blue.

24
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:08.760
And Shri Brahmadeva gave him a yellow dot.

25
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.920
Because yellow is the color of creativity.

26
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.840
So, blue and yellow.

27
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:33.720
Now, Vlodya is going to scold me because he is going to say that I am doing politics here.

28
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.200
Blue and yellow.

29
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:59.880
So, today we are in this blue and let us pray that we will be engulfed by the Puja, Pushve Krishna.

30
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.200
Because he is really the one we need to pray for the sort of situation in which we are.

31
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.920
So, we need to pray that we will be able to do something in this way.

32
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.720
That is Shri Krishna.

33
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:26.000
Yeah. So...

34
00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.720
We need to understand what is important for us and what it is that we can do and what it is that we cannot do.

35
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:46.880
And what is our responsibility?

36
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:57.720
We have heard Shri Mataji this morning and it is of course difficult to speak after she spoke.

37
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:05.960
But thank God there is the lunch in between.

38
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:21.440
So, I just want to give you an idea of the pilgrimage on which we are.

39
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:34.480
Shri Mataji, you know, in the Bible it is written that Christ is the Alpha and the Omega.

40
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.000
And Shri Mataji said it is true.

41
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.800
So, the Alpha of Christ is Shri Ganesha.

42
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.000
The Omega of Christ is Shri Kalki.

43
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:17.960
And the turning point, the strategic turning point of this entire great game is the Agnya Chakra.

44
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:34.920
So, if I would be the devil, now contrary to what you may have heard, I am not the devil.

45
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:45.320
But if I would be the devil, I would attack when it is strategic.

46
00:06:45.320 --> 00:07:03.800
So, there are two things that the devil is going to attack to prevent the Omega of history.

47
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:17.080
One thing that is going to attack very logically is our unity.

48
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:33.640
Because when I wrote the advent, I wrote something and then I asked Shri Mataji, is it true?

49
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:43.160
Do you know Shri Kalki as a horse and as a parrot?

50
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:52.360
So, I asked her about the horse and I asked her about the parrot.

51
00:07:52.360 --> 00:08:01.640
So, I asked Shri Mataji, is it so that the collective consciousness of the yogis is the horse of Shri Kalki?

52
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:17.640
And she said yes, this is so.

53
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:24.520
So, please note, we are not Shri Kalki.

54
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:33.640
Some time ago, mad people thought they were Napoleon.

55
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:41.240
Now mad people in Sahaja Yoga think they are Kalki.

56
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:48.680
So, no, but the collective consciousness is the vahana.

57
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:57.880
So, the support of collective consciousness is the unity between the yogis.

58
00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:09.880
So, obviously, the devil needs to attack our unity.

59
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:21.560
And as I told you, in the 80s, in the 70s it was the discovery.

60
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:28.520
In the 80s it was the expansion.

61
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:38.120
In the 90s we got attacked by outside power, like the power of the state, the Fegul rules, we got attacked from the outside.

62
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:59.080
And the first decade of the third millennium we got attacked from the inside, because for the first time we really became divided.

63
00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:06.760
And this had to happen because we were tested.

64
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:21.000
And now in this decade in which we are now, it is time to emerge from the divisions.

65
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:29.560
Now when I speak about divisions, maybe you think about Russia and Ukraine.

66
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:45.640
But it is not just that. Maybe collectivities have been divided in the last 15 years or in the last 10 years.

67
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:55.800
Because here there is a lot of activity going on.

68
00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:02.440
Because it is the last gate.

69
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:08.840
So the last gate has to be the most difficult, isn't it?

70
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:18.040
Sri Mataji said that the Shakti of Shrikalki is Mahamaya.

71
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:24.440
It's the power of illusion and confusion.

72
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:36.520
And this power is also of course on us, on me, on you, on the yogis.

73
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.920
Because she is going to test the matter.

74
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.360
Why is she testing the matter?

75
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.800
Please understand this is just logic.

76
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:56.840
She tests the matter because as we said in a seminar in Sopran,

77
00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:07.800
the previous protocol of Kundalini awakening, that was the protocol given by Adi Shakti, was...

78
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:27.560
...was that the Kundalini is rising only when all the chakras are pure.

79
00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.840
And the cheetah is pure.

80
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:41.160
And with us in Nargol in 1973, Mataji saw that if she would maintain this protocol, we would be lost.

81
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.200
Because we could not fit the criteria.

82
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.320
And she decided to change the protocol of the yogis.

83
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.600
She said that the second protocol is not true.

84
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:55.400
So she changed the protocol of the yogis.

85
00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:02.760
So she changed her own protocol which was the binding, the deities and the Maharishis and the gurus and everybody.

86
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.960
She changed the protocol because in her incarnation as Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

87
00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:16.440
she decided to give realization to people who were not ready, who were not prepared.

88
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:36.440
So when Gregoire gets his realization, he gets the certificate.

89
00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:48.440
But Gregoire has not yet passed the exams.

90
00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:55.880
Before you pass the exam and then you have the certificate.

91
00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.240
Now we have the certificate but we need to pass the exam.

92
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:11.240
That's why after your realization there is a period of test.

93
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:21.000
Because only in this period of test we are obliged to introspect.

94
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.160
We are obliged to witness.

95
00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:30.840
We are obliged to forgive.

96
00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:37.960
And we are obliged to transform.

97
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:50.840
Because I am not a Sahaja Yogi if I say Shri Mataji instead of saying good morning.

98
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:59.880
I am not a Sahaja Yogi if I sing bhajan or if I go to bhujaz.

99
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:05.880
I am a Sahaja Yogi if I transform.

100
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:13.480
And this is the path between the Alpha and the Omega.

101
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.800
And we have to know which letter of the Greek alphabet.

102
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.800
Beta, Gamma, Kappa, Lambda, Epsilon.

103
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.240
Which letter are we?

104
00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.160
That is our job to know.

105
00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.280
It's our job to decline this alphabet.

106
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:55.160
Now some of you are sitting here and maybe not now because you had a good meditation

107
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.160
but otherwise you would be angry.

108
00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:13.080
Because you don't understand what's happening to your country.

109
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:26.600
And you say, you know, why do you talk of love when I am under immigration?

110
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.440
Some of you feel that way.

111
00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:40.520
And some of you wonder what can you do to help your country.

112
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:48.200
But your responsibility is first to help yourself.

113
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:54.680
If you want to help your country with political means you are an insignificant force.

114
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.200
Insignificant.

115
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:14.280
If you want to help yourself first and your country with your spiritual powers you can

116
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.680
be in Ukraine here a significant force.

117
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:41.880
But for this we need to understand how it works.

118
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.000
How do we access our spiritual powers.

119
00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:55.880
So I apologize for those who have seen it already but I am going to draw again my little

120
00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.640
magical triangle.

121
00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:14.200
This is just to explain you something.

122
00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:30.120
So let's say here is Mr. A.

123
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:44.200
And Mr. A has a problem B. And that can be for instance that someone

124
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:56.120
in Maidan will find or feel that everybody in Kharkov are terrorists or it may mean that

125
00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:03.080
someone in Luang feel that everybody in Luang are fascists.

126
00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.840
Okay so they have a problem.

127
00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.640
Right?

128
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.120
Now they have a problem and they want to solve the problem.

129
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.120
So they apply themselves to solve the problem.

130
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:40.120
Or maybe if you think this is too political let's say you have a problem and you have

131
00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.320
a bad dentist.

132
00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:41.960
Alright?

133
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.000
So you can relax.

134
00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.160
Or you have a bad boss in the office.

135
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.680
Okay it's easier.

136
00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:06.920
So if I try to solve here between A and B I go into action reaction.

137
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:22.440
So I give Bandhan to my boss.

138
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.640
I should beat my boss.

139
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:33.080
Or I should beat the people in Kharkov or in Luang.

140
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:41.560
And I throw them in the haven.

141
00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.520
Because I think this is using the sahaj power.

142
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:44.840
Right?

143
00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:49.720
But it is not.

144
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:56.280
Because I am in the mood of reactivity which is below the aghia chakra.

145
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.600
So now what is the...

146
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:07.160
Try to understand because it's for you it's not for me.

147
00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:11.960
It's really important you understand that because you suffer in this country.

148
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.920
And as yogi you need to emerge from suffering.

149
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:33.720
So now the alternative is that I have my problem with my boss A.B.

150
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.480
But I turn to C.

151
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.520
And C you can call C.

152
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.640
Of course C is thoughtlessness.

153
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:49.960
C is turning to the divine power.

154
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.280
Connecting to Shri Mataji.

155
00:21:54.360 --> 00:22:03.720
Abandoning our problem to the great most powerful computer in the universe.

156
00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:21.320
Shri Mataji explained this morning how to do that.

157
00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:29.000
That if I do that and this is where you start shifting.

158
00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.080
I start shifting my attention.

159
00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:37.080
Because instead of coming back home with pain in the stomach because my boss is a media

160
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.560
and I am upset.

161
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.000
As I am upset I go down in my yoga.

162
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.120
I am angry I go down in my yoga.

163
00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.560
I hate him I go down in my yoga.

164
00:22:49.560 --> 00:23:12.520
So...

165
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:20.760
The first advantage is that by doing that as a yogi, because this is exerting my spiritual power,

166
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:25.800
not in reactivity, but this, because Agnya is here.

167
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:42.920
So there is a big thing which is happening, big thing which is happening for me,

168
00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.640
is that I start to detach.

169
00:23:45.640 --> 00:24:09.800
I'm not telling you not to be patriotic, but you don't tell if you suffer.

170
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:16.200
You don't tell if you lose your spiritual powers.

171
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:28.040
So when you go into that mode of detachment, many things happen.

172
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:43.240
The first win which happen is that you get your freedom from.

173
00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:48.440
You get your freedom from the problem.

174
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.120
The problem is still there.

175
00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:58.680
They are still killing each other in the east of your country.

176
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:03.640
You still have corruption in your government.

177
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.600
There are still spies in your army.

178
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:16.200
But that problem is not your problem.

179
00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:25.240
Because you have risen in your consciousness, like you rise from the valley on the top of the mountain,

180
00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:40.680
and you see things, and when you see things, things are away from you.

181
00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.200
Now why is this important?

182
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:56.040
Because if you remain stuck here with your little Agnya completely blocked,

183
00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.480
you are an user.

184
00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.520
And you want to be a winner.

185
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:08.200
And to be a winner on the spiritual battlefield, you need to climb up here.

186
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:16.200
And don't stay here.

187
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:20.440
Now comes the magic.

188
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.960
Because magic exists.

189
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.480
So that's the first win.

190
00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:31.240
Now the magic is the second win.

191
00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:38.600
And the magic is that if I have reached that level,

192
00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:50.920
which has to be seen on an empirical level, sometimes we do, sometimes we don't.

193
00:26:50.920 --> 00:27:05.000
But if I have reached this level, then that power appears, starts working on the problem.

194
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:13.480
So for instance, in my example where I have a bad boss,

195
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:20.600
suddenly my boss is promoted somewhere else.

196
00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:30.520
And I have no boss who should meet anymore, the next one is very nice.

197
00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.040
You have not done anything.

198
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.720
You have gone to your mother.

199
00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:41.000
And something happened.

200
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.720
Now for this to happen to your kind friend,

201
00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.640
you need one thing.

202
00:27:51.640 --> 00:28:04.840
You need many things.

203
00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:09.640
First of all,

204
00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:15.320
don't be upset with Vlodia.

205
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:20.520
If you think it's too sweet,

206
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:34.520
if you think there should be more pepper and more piment and more anger,

207
00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:43.080
because Vlodia wants to keep all of you together.

208
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:53.160
Not only that, but he understands that your collectivity is part of Elagia's collectivity.

209
00:28:53.160 --> 00:29:10.840
He also understands that Shri Mataji did love her children in Russia and her children in Ukraine.

210
00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:21.640
Now you have forces of negativity which are creating this split between brothers, between sisters.

211
00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:33.240
And as yogi, we need in our being to desire to help the legacy of unity in our Sangha,

212
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:37.640
so that we are an effective collective instrument.

213
00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:46.120
Because if you in Ukraine are united as Sangha, then you start having spiritual powers.

214
00:29:46.120 --> 00:30:05.480
And then perhaps the second wind might happen.

215
00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:11.640
Now you notice I'm not yet talking about politics.

216
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:22.920
Now there is another Ukrainian word that I understood in the presentation of Vlodia.

217
00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.040
And it's the word politics.

218
00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:33.800
And I'm sure he said we don't want to do politics here.

219
00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:44.520
I just want to tell you, you know who has invented politics?

220
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:57.240
Who has invented politics?

221
00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.360
No, not the TV. No, no, no, no.

222
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.400
You see, those who have brought...

223
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.640
Someone said Shri Krishna, yes, you would say.

224
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:12.600
But, you know, those who have taught politics to mankind,

225
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:18.920
there are two adigurus which have influenced tremendously the evolution of the world.

226
00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:24.760
You have Confucius in China.

227
00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:44.120
And a lot of Confucius is about the science of governance.

228
00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:51.320
And the other one who is our guru is Socrates.

229
00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:57.880
He is the one who has invented democracy.

230
00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:04.040
So yesterday I was with one of our friends, I don't know whether he is here,

231
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:07.400
he was saying that he is fully Ukrainian and his friend was saying,

232
00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.560
no, no, you are fully Russian.

233
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:24.840
And he was saying democracy is demonocracy.

234
00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:30.280
Now we can talk about this another time.

235
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:42.360
But what I'm trying to say is that politics also brings solutions.

236
00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:51.560
When enlightened people do politics.

237
00:32:51.560 --> 00:33:00.680
Because politics in Greek means a city.

238
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:09.000
And politics is the art of keeping the city together.

239
00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Now again, I cannot solve the problem, Ukraine-Russia, okay?

240
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.640
I am ignorant, I am an idiot, I am a little baby in the world of my mother, I cannot.

241
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.720
But I'm just going to give you some ideas of a direction.

242
00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:43.400
So let us move to the next step.

243
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:47.720
What is the place of Ukraine in this drama?

244
00:33:49.640 --> 00:34:07.880
So you have not very good, I didn't see very well, my rounds are not so round.

245
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:16.600
So you have left and right.

246
00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:25.800
Now you have China.

247
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:30.600
Isn't it interesting that for the two panels of the idea you have two superpowers?

248
00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:46.360
Okay, now you know, I told you this already, the two panels,

249
00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:51.640
you know, Shri Mahaliram on the left, Shri Buddha on the right.

250
00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:54.360
And now we open the two panels of the idea.

251
00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:12.920
So, you know, I have gone to the two last national seminars in China.

252
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:19.640
And I told them that, and this is also the inheritance of Confucius,

253
00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:23.960
who speaks about the superior man, who is basically the realized soul.

254
00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:51.160
I told them that faith is terribly important.

255
00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:59.160
Now it is not the faith of the fanatics below the ajna chakra,

256
00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:04.440
it's not the faith of the fundamentalists,

257
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:11.160
it's the faith based on the living experience of feeling the Atman.

258
00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:23.160
Feeling the vibrations, feeling satchitananda, knowing that God is with us.

259
00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:35.160
So I told our Chinese brothers and sisters that in the past the emperor of China was the son of heaven.

260
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:48.120
But now you all are the sons and the daughters of Adi Shakti,

261
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:53.160
so you all are sakshat, the sons and the daughters of heaven.

262
00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:59.640
And if you have faith in this, then you are going to be so powerful spiritually.

263
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:16.200
So, and China is not doing badly by the way compared to Russia.

264
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.200
So here is faith.

265
00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:33.720
I could take a little bit more time to explain but it takes too much time with the translation.

266
00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:43.800
Because all these things work above the ajna.

267
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:50.600
Under the ajna, then the Tsar of Russia, seeing that he is an autocrat by the grace of God.

268
00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:04.120
Or the king of France, seeing that he is a divine right king, why he is very licentious?

269
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:12.760
This faith below the ajna is destructive.

270
00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.560
Because it is falsehood.

271
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:24.440
And that's why faith is so destructive.

272
00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.440
With a Muslim fundamentalist for instance.

273
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:38.040
But faith above the ajna is not falsehood, it is reality.

274
00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.160
So it is constructive.

275
00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.320
Now what about Russia?

276
00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:56.680
And then what about Ukraine, right?

277
00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.680
Now I'm not telling you to believe me.

278
00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.200
I'm not telling you this is what Shri Mataji taught me.

279
00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.280
I propose you a vision.

280
00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.000
An auspicious vision.

281
00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:27.080
You know auspicious vision is called sudarshan.

282
00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:37.080
And sudarshan is the discus of Shri Krishna.

283
00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:47.080
And so today we are having the puja where we worship that's a faith.

284
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:51.160
Where we worship Sakshat Shri Krishna in Shri Mataji.

285
00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.160
So back to Russia, surrender.

286
00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:05.160
Now what does surrender mean?

287
00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.160
Surrender is the most important thing.

288
00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.160
Now what does surrender mean for Russia?

289
00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:19.160
Well it means Russia needs to relax.

290
00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.160
Russia needs to relax.

291
00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.160
It is not so much a belief that Russia needs to relax.

292
00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.160
Russia needs to relax.

293
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:39.160
It is not true that the entire West hates Russia.

294
00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.160
It is not true.

295
00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:51.160
It is not true that Western sahaja yogi don't love Russian sahaja yogi.

296
00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.160
It is not true that you have to keep everything under control all the time.

297
00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:09.160
Surrender is an act of freedom.

298
00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:21.160
Because, understand that if there are Russians.

299
00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:27.160
Because you trust enough to surrender.

300
00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.160
Trust.

301
00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.160
Trust.

302
00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:53.160
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is completely negative.

303
00:41:53.160 --> 00:42:07.160
And as yogi in our heart of hearts we need to wish and pray that this absurdity, this plot of satan be brought to an end.

304
00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:13.160
This plot of satan be brought to an end.

305
00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:27.160
So, now we are in Krita yoga.

306
00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.160
Do you know what is Krita yoga?

307
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:43.160
You have Krita yoga, the age of darkness and you have satya yoga at a new age.

308
00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:49.160
In between there is a tunnel.

309
00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:53.160
And in the tunnel is called Krita yoga.

310
00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:57.160
And in the tunnel everything gets exposed.

311
00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:05.160
So everything which doesn't work in the world comes out.

312
00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:13.160
So this is why you get depressed by watching the news.

313
00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:21.160
Because it is a mad house all over the place.

314
00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:39.160
The Europeans they are dealing with 1.7 million refugees from the middle east.

315
00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:43.160
While the population, the civil population are being bombed.

316
00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:47.160
They are unable until now to handle that.

317
00:43:47.160 --> 00:44:03.160
So also you should not count on Europe to be the savior of the situation here.

318
00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:07.160
Because Europe is up to here in its own problems.

319
00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:25.160
So Krita yoga exposes things and Krita yoga moves things, shakes up things.

320
00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:33.160
So it exerts pressure on the agar.

321
00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:51.160
So again I wish I could do a little nice.

322
00:44:51.160 --> 00:45:01.160
Yeah good, you get the idea.

323
00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:11.160
So now in this vision Ukraine is the left side of the right agar.

324
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:25.160
And so with the pressure from Krita yoga on the right and the left agar.

325
00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:33.160
You have a new space which is created.

326
00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:39.160
And this is Ukraine.

327
00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:50.160
Why not a battle with Belorussia, why not invade Kazakhstan or Uzbekistan, why Ukraine?

328
00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:04.160
Because we need to open the agar chakra.

329
00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:13.160
And if it is true that Ukraine is the place of the mother.

330
00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:27.160
And if it is true that you worship the mother before the Christian era and you knew about Kundalini.

331
00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:31.160
Then you have a heritage which is special.

332
00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:34.160
So what should you do?

333
00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:50.160
If you arise in your spiritual power and you activate the power of faith.

334
00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:54.160
It has to be faith in yourself.

335
00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:09.160
Faith in yourself means that you don't just look at what all the others are doing wrong out there.

336
00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.160
You look at yourself.

337
00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:17.160
You look at yourself as a spiritual being and you focus on going up here.

338
00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:22.160
Because this is where you find the reason to have faith in yourself.

339
00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:39.160
Because with faith you have trust.

340
00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:46.160
With faith you have connection with the Divine.

341
00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:51.160
And with faith you don't need to react.

342
00:47:54.160 --> 00:48:00.160
And if you can achieve this at the spiritual level.

343
00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:07.160
Then you can have an impact at the central level of Russia.

344
00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:21.160
Now if you listen to me mentally you will say this is a tale for little children.

345
00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:28.160
It is irrelevant in the present condition.

346
00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:37.160
This guy should go and see how many people died in the border with Luang and Karkov and those places.

347
00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:49.160
But remember I have invited you not to look at it from that perspective.

348
00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:52.160
Because from that perspective you cannot do anything.

349
00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:06.160
I invite you to become that we become master of ourselves.

350
00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:09.160
Because we cannot master the situation.

351
00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:25.160
And so I have faith in yourself as people, I have faith in yourself as a nation.

352
00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:29.160
But without aggressivity. Because aggressivity is a reaction.

353
00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:36.160
And we have to say that you are a leader, a leader in the nation and a leader in the world.

354
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.160
And you have to be aggressive.

355
00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:53.160
I would like to ask you a question.

356
00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.160
What is the question?

357
00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:08.160
If somebody who come in my house to kill me, should I love this person?

358
00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:11.160
What would you do? Would you love this person?

359
00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:31.160
My answer would be if somebody come in my house to kill me, what I would try to do is to kill that person first.

360
00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:46.160
But without hate. We cannot afford to hate.

361
00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:53.160
If we hate we lose our spiritual powers and then the devil has won his blood.

362
00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:21.160
I was with Sri Mataji at a program for generals and colonels at the army chief of staff of the south and command in India in Pune.

363
00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:30.160
I was with Sri Mataji at a program for generals and colonels at the army chief of staff of the south and command in Pune.

364
00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:46.160
And I was with Sri Mataji at a program for generals and colonels at the army chief of staff of the south and command in Pune.

365
00:51:51.160 --> 00:52:00.160
Which means a quick liberation from the difficulties of existence.

366
00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:14.160
So this is a nice attitude, isn't it? There is no hate.

367
00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:27.160
So aggression is wrong. Accepting aggression is wrong.

368
00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:47.160
But don't ever think that Russians are a people who are your enemies. Because then you follow exactly where the devil wants you to follow.

369
00:52:57.160 --> 00:53:17.160
If you would know how much Sri Mataji loved both Ukrainian and Russian you would not let hate in your heart.

370
00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:32.160
Because what we need to do is fight negativity. Not fight with the ABC or these people or that people.

371
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:44.160
It's quite a difficult subject. Did I manage to make myself understood?

372
00:53:47.160 --> 00:54:10.160
So if you have faith in yourself, you are strong enough to love. But you don't accept aggression.

373
00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:26.160
And from that then respect will come. There are political solutions to the problem.

374
00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:33.160
But I can't allow you to speak about politics.

375
00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:53.160
You know, my job in the United Nations was to put countries together, not people.

376
00:54:53.160 --> 00:55:00.160
So there is always a way.

377
00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:15.160
But the other vlogger who is sitting here, he likes to have secrets. So I will not tell you what is the political situation.

378
00:55:15.160 --> 00:55:21.160
Or the political solution.

379
00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:37.160
So...

380
00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:56.160
But you know, do you have...

381
00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:37.160
You are so important. Try to rise.

382
00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:59.160
One day in Italy Sri Mataji said, 50% of Sahaja Yogis are mediocre. 25% are idiots.

383
00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:05.160
And the rest I don't know.

384
00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:17.160
I, at that time, I hoped to be in the I don't know category.

385
00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:26.160
But on reflection I was probably in the mediocre one.

386
00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:37.160
Why? If we look at ourselves, what is the state of our attention?

387
00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:46.160
Are we thinking all the time? Or do we have the shakti of chitta nirod?

388
00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:54.160
That we can take back our attention within ourselves.

389
00:57:54.160 --> 00:58:11.160
Because this is the way we can go up on the side of the triangle.

390
00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:31.160
You see, detachment is very important because detachment is what allows us to go into nirvikalva.

391
00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:37.160
Complete detachment in the attention.

392
00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:41.160
Complete freedom of the attention.

393
00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:44.160
Complete silence.

394
00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:49.160
And then this is the toria state.

395
00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:57.160
And then with that we can bring the shishiva in the vivata.

396
00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:01.160
Because the brain is the vivata.

397
00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:16.160
So today when we have the puja, let us pray for our poor, poor brains.

398
00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:28.160
Sri Krishna is the right, is the deity of the brain.

399
00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:39.160
See, the heart is the organ of the left side, the liver the organ of the right side, but the brain is the organ of evolution.

400
00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:57.160
And the Mahalakshmi force on the central channel, she pushes us into pure freedom.

401
00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:09.160
And this is Hegel who inspired Marx, Engels and Lenin. Poor things.

402
01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:21.160
Hegel said that the purpose of history is the world spirit actualizing its complete freedom.

403
01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:27.160
Freedom from ignorance. Freedom from the enemies of the soul in the human consciousness.

404
01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:33.160
This is our journey. This is our battlefield. Not gluonsk.

405
01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:39.160
And Hegel, who is the one who inspired Marx, Engels, and Lenin,

406
01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:44.160
said that the power of the shishiva is the power of the mind.

407
01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:48.160
The power of the mind is the power of the mind.

408
01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.160
The power of the mind is the power of the mind.

409
01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:55.160
Okay. Any questions?

410
01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:07.160
Thank you.

411
01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:57.160
The question is that this intersection of two circles that you draw,

412
01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:07.160
is it like your vision of that, the mission of Ukraine is to expand this area of what is like from a technical perspective,

413
01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.160
what is your feeling about it?

414
01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:24.160
I wish I could say that I am the teacher in the class.

415
01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:40.160
And the teacher is a problem to the students and it is up to the students to solve the problem.

416
01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:47.160
But I cannot say that because I am not your teacher, I am your brother.

417
01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:59.160
So, you see, if you are an ancient spiritual land, and Shri Mataji said that you are an ancient spiritual land,

418
01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:17.160
and if you are Sahaja Yogis, you need to have a spiritual vision, not a political one.

419
01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:39.160
So, to see yourself separated is not in the logic of collective consciousness.

420
01:03:39.160 --> 01:04:08.160
If you activate your spiritual potential, what we must pray is that somehow from here, not from here,

421
01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:15.160
the divide will impact on the situation.

422
01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:24.160
And one condition for a solution is mutual respect.

423
01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:35.160
One needs to return to mutual respect.

424
01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:38.160
And you are Russian and Ukrainian?

425
01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:45.160
I am Russian and Ukrainian, but I am not a citizen of the United States.

426
01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:50.160
You know, in South America you have the Reconciliation and Truth Commission.

427
01:04:50.160 --> 01:05:19.160
In South Africa, there was a time of Mandela. Of course, we don't have Mandela.

428
01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:27.160
But what happened is that the people were the security force of apartheid, and the Africans that they tortured,

429
01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:36.160
they met together around the table, and they said what they had on their heart on both sides, and then they agreed to reconcile.

430
01:05:36.160 --> 01:06:01.160
So, you know, if there is a change of heart, these processes can help.

431
01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:25.160
Also, if you have a diversity in your country, you can have a state structure which reflects the diversity.

432
01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:31.160
For instance, in Germany, what is the name of Germany? Germany is not called Germany.

433
01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:36.160
Germany is called Wundesrepublikdeutschland, the Federal Republic of Germany.

434
01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:46.160
What it means is that you have a federal state, but then you have land with autonomous fiscal responsibilities,

435
01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:52.160
autonomous rights in several fields, including security, including education.

436
01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:55.160
It works in Germany. It works in the United States.

437
01:06:55.160 --> 01:07:02.160
And in my country, we have four official languages, and nobody cares about it.

438
01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:39.160
So you need to get out of down here and be reactive to a situation, take some altitude and look,

439
01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:43.160
or your elites should look at intelligent solutions.

440
01:07:53.160 --> 01:08:01.160
But I'm not saying that I give you a solution, because I don't know what the solution is.

441
01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:10.160
What I'm saying is you guys, you ladies, you will have to find what is the solution.

442
01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:16.160
But before you can find a solution, you need to be at the level where you can impact the parent's identity.

443
01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:33.160
So it is very tough. I know it is a very tough place to be.

444
01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:41.160
But the world is going to be a very tough place in many, many, many areas of the world.

445
01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:52.160
In a hundred years or so, Bangladesh is probably going to be under the waters.

446
01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:59.160
And can you see how much migrants that will send to India?

447
01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:05.160
So we need to shape up.

448
01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:16.160
Because this movement here, this pressure obliges to shape up.

449
01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:25.160
And evolution is the survival of the fetus.

450
01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:32.160
But now it's going to be the survival of the spiritually fetus.

451
01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:46.160
So we need to relax.

452
01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:57.160
Because someone else is running the show.

453
01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.160
Any other question?

454
01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:01.160
Any other question?

455
01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.160
Any other question?

456
01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.160
Any other question?

457
01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:26.160
There is an incident, we have one more question.

458
01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:30.160
This is from Tanya, from Slovakia.

459
01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.160
She is from Czech.

460
01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:36.160
What is his name?

461
01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.160
I don't know.

462
01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.160
Young? Young. Young.

463
01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.160
Young.

464
01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.160
I have a question.

465
01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.160
You have a big smile.

466
01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.160
Yes, you have a smile.

467
01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.160
I can't read it.

468
01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.160
I have a lot of thoughts.

469
01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.160
I want to ask you a question.

470
01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:02.160
What is your most important thing?

471
01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.160
What is your most important thing?

472
01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:06.160
What is your most important thing?

473
01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.160
What is your most important thing?

474
01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.160
What is important?

475
01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.160
I don't know what I'm going to say.

476
01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.160
But important is saying both.

477
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.160
Important is saying both.

478
01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:18.160
You speak of respect.

479
01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:22.160
And you said that without respect we can't approach each other.

480
01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.160
But respect is love, in fact.

481
01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:26.160
Yes, that's right.

482
01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.160
And you said that without respect we can't approach each other.

483
01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.160
But respect is love, in fact.

484
01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.160
Yes, that's right.

485
01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.160
But respect is love, in fact.

486
01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:14.160
If we have no respect, then there is no love.

487
01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:22.160
If there are any misunderstandings, any language questions, any language misunderstandings, then there is no respect, there is no love.

488
01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.160
And Shri Mataji says,

489
01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:32.160
If there are any misunderstandings, any language questions, any language misunderstandings, then there is no respect, there is no love.

490
01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:36.160
And Shri Mataji said, and Haddad, in our mantra book.

491
01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.160
What is asking, what is the question?

492
01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.160
Just a couple of things.

493
01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.160
I would like to ask you,

494
01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:48.160
I would like to ask you,

495
01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:57.160
how do you feel about our relationship with our society?

496
01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:08.160
What do you think about the relationship between our society and our society?

497
01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:18.160
The question is, how can we love our mother so much that we see our mother in the faces of our sisters and brothers?

498
01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:24.160
That we imagine our mother in the place of our sisters and brothers?

499
01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:35.160
If you want to meet someone, you need to go to this place where that person lives.

500
01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:48.160
Okay, if you want to meet me, you have to come into my house.

501
01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:56.160
If you want to meet your mother, you have to go into her house.

502
01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:20.160
Okay, if you want to meet her, you have to come into her house.

503
01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:32.160
You know, on the side of love, you have many, many, many expressions of feelings.

504
01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:38.160
On the side of hate, you have many expressions of feelings.

505
01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:58.160
So, introspection helps us doing the selection.

506
01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:13.160
So, introspection is, you know, the toolbox.

507
01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:25.160
Okay, I'm just wondering whether you allow me to go on holiday now?

508
01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:38.160
I just wanted to talk about this, not so many other things.

509
01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:42.160
I would like to talk about the relationship between our sisters and brothers.

510
01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:53.160
In Prakash, when it was a problem, you talked about the notion of hope.

511
01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:57.160
And actually that was the question of the brother.

512
01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:04.160
Maybe if you could elaborate on that, if you feel so.

513
01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:14.160
But you see, if you wanted me to elaborate on these things, you should not have put this video this morning.

514
01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:41.160
Because Jan asked a very good question, but I felt that mother spoke about this during the speech this morning.

515
01:16:54.160 --> 01:17:05.160
Also, you know, I feel if we have a pudra tonight, then now we can relax a little bit and, you know, talk a bit.

516
01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:17.160
And the Semina can continue tomorrow.

517
01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:33.160
So, Engelbert, you lead this short meditation of Wolfgang.

518
01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:57.160
Thank you.
