00:00:05.853 --> 00:00:13.960
So science cannot answer many questions
and one of them is that “Why are we on this Earth?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.965
What is the purpose of our life? What is
the goal of our life? What is our identity?

00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:28.654
This question is not asked and,
if asked, they cannot answer.

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:34.624
They cannot answer this simple
question, “Why are we on this Earth?”

00:00:35.256 --> 00:00:42.415
But one has to know that we are
on this Earth to become the Spirit,

00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:45.082
to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:00:45.162 --> 00:00:48.754
This is our purpose. That’s why we are here,

00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:57.016
and then to be the instruments of that
Divine Power, which is all-pervading.

00:00:57.096 --> 00:01:01.543
This Divine Power has been described in many ways.

00:01:01.623 --> 00:01:05.127
Patanjali has called has called it as Ritambarapragya.

00:01:05.207 --> 00:01:09.350
In the Bible it is called as the
Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.031
Also it is called as the All Pervading Power of Divine Love.

00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:18.458
In the Koran it is called as Ruh.

00:01:18.538 --> 00:01:23.946
In the Indian scriptures it is called as Paramchaitanya.

00:01:24.026 --> 00:01:28.928
The civilization in the West has grown very big.

00:01:29.008 --> 00:01:32.916
It’s like a big tree outgrown its size,

00:01:32.996 --> 00:01:36.657
but we must find out our roots.

00:01:36.737 --> 00:01:41.291
I do not make difference between East and West.

00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:47.229
So we must find out our roots,
whether it comes from East or from West.

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:53.200
The knowledge today I’m going to tell
you about is the knowledge of our roots.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.334
We have been already told about the centers

00:01:56.414 --> 00:02:01.290
and about this power that is called as Kundalini.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.334
This power is placed in the triangular
bone which is called as sacrum,

00:02:07.414 --> 00:02:11.773
which means Greeks knew about this centre.

00:02:11.853 --> 00:02:17.395
They very well knew about it, that’s
why they called it sacred, sacrum.

00:02:17.475 --> 00:02:31.062
In many countries there has been a manifestation
that they know about this particular power.

00:02:31.142 --> 00:02:43.966
I happened to go to Colombia where I collected
an authentic antique copy of the antique necklace.

00:02:44.046 --> 00:02:49.181
The necklace had at its bottom a Kundalini

00:02:49.261 --> 00:03:03.982
and even the earrings had the Kundalini, but,
surprisingly, it was from the Indians of America,

00:03:04.062 --> 00:03:10.038
found here with the Indians of America,

00:03:10.118 --> 00:03:14.654
though it is now kept in the museum in Colombia.

00:03:14.734 --> 00:03:19.524
It was in America that people
knew about Kundalini, definitely,

00:03:19.604 --> 00:03:26.042
absolutely in three and a half coil
they had done this pattern very well.

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:33.686
Is very surprising that it was done
even before Columbus came here.

00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:37.923
So this knowledge was known to
people, I think, all over the world,

00:03:38.003 --> 00:03:42.251
but then gradually it subsided.

00:03:42.331 --> 00:03:50.052
Especially in India, till the twelfth
century, it was kept as a tradition

00:03:50.132 --> 00:03:56.275
just to give realization to one person,
one guru and one realization.

00:03:56.355 --> 00:04:00.302
There was not a sort of a mass realization, or anything,

00:04:00.382 --> 00:04:03.413
and they didn’t even talk about it. They kept a secret.

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:09.423
But in the twelfth century one
great poet called Ganyeshwara,

00:04:09.503 --> 00:04:16.462
he wrote in his book, “Ganyeshwari,”
sixth chapter about Kundalini.

00:04:16.542 --> 00:04:19.572
He took the permission of his guru and he wrote it,

00:04:19.652 --> 00:04:26.024
but still they denounced it and they
said that this is something not to be read

00:04:26.104 --> 00:04:30.185
because they didn’t know how to do it.
They didn’t know how to raise the Kundalini.

00:04:30.265 --> 00:04:32.358
They didn’t know how to give realization.

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:40.345
So the people who were at the helm of affairs
said, they denounced it, “Don’t read this chapter.”

00:04:40.425 --> 00:04:47.065
Then in the sixteenth century we had
many poets in India who have written about it,

00:04:47.145 --> 00:04:54.753
Guru Nanaka, Kabira, Ramadasa, so many of
them have written about this Kundalini awakening.
