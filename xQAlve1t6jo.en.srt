1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:10,100
I bow to all the seekers of absolute truth.

2
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:24,460
At the very outset, I have to say that truth is truth.

3
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,340
This absolute truth cannot be changed because it is absolute.

4
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,380
It cannot be transformed.

5
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,980
It cannot be explained

6
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:47,300
because it cannot be described: truth has to be experienced.

7
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,540
It’s an experience.

8
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,940
In Sanskrit language, we have a word called Veda.

9
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:05,780
It comes from the word ‘vida’. ‘Vida’ means to know on your central nervous system.

10
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,940
Like, I can feel this [armchair].

11
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,420
In the same way, you must know the truth on your fingertips.

12
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:23,220
‘Bodh” also, from where the word Buddha has come, is that enlightenment;

13
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,740
you have to feel it on your central nervous system.

14
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:44,740
So, this absolute truth is what it was and is and will be.

15
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,420
But I would request you not to believe me

16
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,300
because this blind faith has caused so much trouble to us.

17
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,100
All the people are fighting all over the world with this blind faith.

18
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,420
They believe in this and they believe in that, believe in that.

19
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,380
This kind of faith is not going to help us.

20
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,060
We have to feel it ourselves and experience it.

21
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,020
Unless and until you experience,

22
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,140
please don’t have faith in me or in Sahaja Yoga.

23
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:33,820
Very important it is to understand that this absolute truth is beyond your mind.

24
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,620
We think no end of our mind.

25
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,660
And all those who came from my country as well as from your own country,

26
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:55,020
to deceive you and make money out of you, have used their mind very well.

27
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:03,060
And your mind could not detect it. Even today, they are there.

28
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:13,180
So, for you to see what is the truth, you must know that you cannot purchase it with money.

29
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,380
This is very difficult to digest it.

30
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:26,980
Many people told me in America, “Mother you can never be successful you cannot get people

31
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:33,700
because they just believe that the person who doesn’t take money has no validity.”

32
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,980
My experience was so horrible!

33
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,460
In Boston, they asked me, in the television,

34
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,820
“How many Roll Royces you have?” [

35
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:46,380
“I have none”.

36
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,620
I said, “My husband has only one car”. “So, you are not in the business?”

37
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,100
“No”.

38
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:59,940
Then they said, “We cannot, we are sorry, you have to be in the business”.

39
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:09,220
So, all these mental acrobats that have been going on in this country …

40
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,620
I’ve been hoping to come to Berkeley

41
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:22,900
that everybody told me that Berkeley is a place where there are people who are truly seeking the truth

42
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,180
and they are revolutionary.

43
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,380
They do not accept anything that is just established.

44
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,900
Imagine after so many years, 27 years,

45
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,940
I am coming to Berkeley, where I was really very anxious to come.

46
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:54,660
So, now the time has come that we have to know the truth.

47
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,300
We have to know the absolute truth.

48
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,060
I call it as a blossom time,

49
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:07,780
because I find there are so many seekers of truth all over the world.

50
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:16,580
And this time has come for these flowers to become the fruit.

51
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:27,900
Very simple thing to understand that this is done by a Power within you as explained to you.

52
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,620
Whether you believe it or not, it is there.

53
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:38,580
This power has to be awakened, that’s all.

54
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,340
A very simple thing, a journey of three to four feet that’s all.

55
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,020
But such a simple thing, people don’t want to accept.

56
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,700
If you say, “Eat this way”, they’ll say, “No, why not this and this way?”

57
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,900
Because of this mind!

58
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,900
This mind is the one which has created real problems for us.

59
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,660
I am told some gentleman is making big money by telling

60
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,780
that how to project this mind here, and project mind there.

61
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,980
It’s like a cocoon.

62
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,340
In a cocoon, you dash here and dash there.

63
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,180
When they said, “You are to be born again”. Clearly,

64
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:34,700
that doesn’t mean that you put a sign board here:

65
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,700
‘born again’. No.

66
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,700
Born again means something has to happen to your consciousness,

67
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,700
to your awareness. You have to be truthful about it.

68
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,180
How can you be satisfied with something which is not the truth?

69
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,940
So, what is the truth?

70
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:06,540
Truth, if you understand, is not this body, this mind, these emotions, these thoughts, and this ego.

71
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:13,340
But it is that you are the pure Spirit.

72
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,980
You are the pure Spirit.

73
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:21,820
You have to become the pure Spirit, that’s all.

74
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,180
This is what is the second birth.

75
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,820
In the Bible, Christ has said, “You have to be born again”.

76
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,060
In every religion, it is said that you are to be born again.
