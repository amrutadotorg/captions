WEBVTT

00:38.000 --> 00:45.124
Today is the first day we are having this puja

00:46.208 --> 00:48.541
in this country of Austria.

00:53.541 --> 00:56.208
This country is

00:59.917 --> 01:05.792
an historical country with different upheavals

01:05.792 --> 01:08.042
it has gone through

01:12.124 --> 01:14.792
to learn so many lessons in life.

01:19.124 --> 01:22.416
But human beings are such that

01:22.666 --> 01:27.083
they do not relate the calamities with their mistakes.

01:29.042 --> 01:30.416
That's how they go on repeating

01:30.416 --> 01:32.875
the same mistakes again and again.

01:35.750 --> 01:40.042
The visit to Vienna was overdue

01:42.750 --> 01:45.291
and I came on a day when we had

01:45.291 --> 01:48.875
to celebrate the birthday of Machindranath.

01:49.792 --> 01:59.875
It's very auspicious for all of you that he should

02:00.124 --> 02:06.458
be today complete his one year of life.

02:15.750 --> 02:19.875
I bless him with all the flowers,

02:19.875 --> 02:23.291
the choicest flowers, of beauty

02:23.291 --> 02:27.166
and bliss on him, and his family,

02:27.792 --> 02:30.124
all his relations and his family.

02:38.500 --> 02:43.166
There are so many things which have been done for the first time.

02:43.166 --> 02:48.500
I should say, for the first time I've come to Vienna,

02:48.750 --> 02:50.500
to Austria,

02:51.583 --> 02:59.249
and first time I've come to the birthday of a child,

02:59.500 --> 03:02.082
on his first birthday.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.124
And on an Ashtami, that is today,

03:08.124 --> 03:10.625
is the eighth day of the moon,

03:11.166 --> 03:16.958
"of the moon which is increasing, shuklapakshi"

03:18.082 --> 03:23.875
that first time all the weapons of the Goddess

03:24.541 --> 03:26.541
are to be worshipped.

03:30.875 --> 03:35.166
This was a great idea because these weapons

03:35.166 --> 03:39.416
who work all the time,

03:42.416 --> 03:45.416
not only to kill the evil

03:45.416 --> 03:47.750
but to protect the good,

03:49.750 --> 03:52.291
"were never worshipped before

03:52.666 --> 03:54.750
and that today,"

03:55.082 --> 03:57.374
if human beings realize

03:57.625 --> 04:00.249
their importance and significance,

04:04.374 --> 04:08.082
then lots of problems of atomic bombs

04:08.082 --> 04:11.249
and all these things that have been created

04:12.625 --> 04:14.500
could be solved by diverting them

04:14.500 --> 04:16.374
to the right direction,

04:17.042 --> 04:20.333
using them for the destructions

04:20.792 --> 04:27.124
"of the evil forces and not the good;"

04:33.583 --> 04:36.708
also for protecting human life,

04:36.708 --> 04:38.917
nourishing human life.

04:44.374 --> 04:47.917
The same weapons can be used in a wrong direction,

04:48.625 --> 04:50.374
but, rightly used,

04:52.708 --> 05:00.500
they can be dedicated for the use of God's work.

05:03.249 --> 05:06.042
All that is created by human beings,

05:10.458 --> 05:13.042
which looks apparently

05:14.917 --> 05:20.458
an instrument of destruction,

05:21.666 --> 05:25.792
but if human beings use their wisdom

05:27.583 --> 05:29.708
they will find out

05:30.249 --> 05:35.500
that all these inventions that have come to them

05:36.708 --> 05:42.625
from the prompting of the Unconscious,

05:43.374 --> 05:46.666
are for the work of God.

05:47.708 --> 05:49.792
All scientific research,

05:50.082 --> 05:52.249
everything that has been done,

05:52.833 --> 05:55.708
all these instruments that you have produced,

05:56.374 --> 05:59.249
are for the use of God.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.124
In a way we can say

06:02.124 --> 06:06.000
that human beings have worked

06:07.750 --> 06:13.249
to create methods as instruments,

06:16.374 --> 06:22.166
as social, economic, political institutions

06:26.750 --> 06:32.082
to advance the mechanism of God's work.

06:33.666 --> 06:36.666
The Unconscious has worked through human beings.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.333
All these institutions,

06:41.666 --> 06:43.917
if they are put to the right side

06:46.249 --> 06:52.291
of their activity and not to the hellish activity,

06:55.208 --> 06:58.666
they all can join together

07:01.708 --> 07:05.708
to complete the work of the Divine.

07:08.291 --> 07:15.083
Like, in the East people believe

07:15.792 --> 07:20.500
that God has created this beautiful body of human beings

07:21.000 --> 07:23.666
and it is for human beings

07:24.666 --> 07:33.208
to create beautiful artistic clothes to enhance the beauty

07:33.666 --> 07:35.708
of what God has created,

07:35.708 --> 07:39.249
to glorify the beauty of what God has created,

07:41.541 --> 07:45.416
to respect the beauty that God has created.

07:49.333 --> 07:52.416
And that's what has happened

07:53.416 --> 07:56.792
in many spheres of life, of human activities,

07:56.792 --> 08:00.000
and should have happened in all of them

08:00.416 --> 08:02.792
if they had used their wisdom.

08:09.666 --> 08:13.792
The question of knowledge

08:15.750 --> 08:17.917
that I discussed before

08:18.166 --> 08:20.875
is very important to understand.

08:23.333 --> 08:26.416
The knowledge that was forbidden

08:26.416 --> 08:29.500
once upon a time, as Adam and Eve,

08:30.166 --> 08:33.625
has been a big problem for human beings to understand.

08:35.291 --> 08:38.583
It was the case when

08:38.583 --> 08:42.458
God created human beings first time,

08:44.124 --> 08:47.458
apart from the celestial beings, who were perfect,

08:50.249 --> 08:51.583
that He wanted to see

08:51.583 --> 08:54.124
if these human beings could grow

08:54.625 --> 08:59.458
in their population and in their awareness,

08:59.958 --> 09:01.917
in their innocence,

09:05.042 --> 09:09.917
they would become Self Realized.

09:12.917 --> 09:16.042
But it was an experiment,

09:16.917 --> 09:20.124
and the human beings failed God at that time,

09:21.042 --> 09:25.124
because they listened to baser promotions

09:25.374 --> 09:26.291
or baser prompting.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.917
That's how they failed

09:38.166 --> 09:40.166
and they lost their innocence.

09:40.249 --> 09:47.833
And loss of innocence is the sin

09:48.917 --> 09:51.124
which was first committed,

09:51.500 --> 09:56.042
and that sin took a different turn

09:58.249 --> 10:00.042
for human beings.

10:00.583 --> 10:04.124
Now, that knowledge, what I've said,

10:04.124 --> 10:06.750
is not this real knowledge.

10:06.750 --> 10:10.583
That was the avidya, the artificial knowledge,

10:10.583 --> 10:13.374
the knowledge that "I am something,"

10:13.958 --> 10:19.833
that "I am the doer", the ego."

10:21.792 --> 10:25.374
Till the animal stage there was no ego,

10:25.625 --> 10:28.833
and then the ego started growing.

10:28.833 --> 10:31.583
We can say that's the beginning

10:31.583 --> 10:33.249
of the original sin:

10:33.249 --> 10:35.374
that "I am something.

10:35.374 --> 10:37.374
I am doing something."

10:37.374 --> 10:40.249
"It's I who can do it". All right?"

10:40.249 --> 10:41.416
So God said,

10:41.416 --> 10:44.917
"Let's see. Let's see their little courage,

10:46.124 --> 10:48.083
and let them decide."

10:49.042 --> 10:51.042
So the plans were changed,

10:51.875 --> 10:55.416
one had to think now that we should

10:55.666 --> 10:58.291
get incarnations on this earth

10:58.792 --> 11:01.416
to help these people, to guide them,

11:01.416 --> 11:03.917
to put them into balance,

11:04.708 --> 11:08.416
to put them into proper understanding of dharma,

11:09.541 --> 11:15.208
so they keep to that balance.

11:15.625 --> 11:20.833
But every time this "I" refused to accept the balance.

11:22.208 --> 11:28.249
And this "I" goes very far from reality.

11:29.625 --> 11:34.374
Today also, when we come to Sahaja Yoga,

11:35.124 --> 11:36.833
I see people,

11:37.374 --> 11:39.625
they don't grow very fast.

11:39.625 --> 11:43.249
Because of this "I" they have questions,

11:44.124 --> 11:48.082
they have doubts, they have problems.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.708
Because of this original sin

11:51.958 --> 11:55.708
people cannot grow very fast.

11:57.042 --> 12:00.374
That, "I am the one, I am free.

12:00.875 --> 12:03.833
Why that? Why this?"

12:04.416 --> 12:06.958
Who are you to ask questions?

12:07.166 --> 12:08.750
Who has made you?

12:08.750 --> 12:11.124
Have you made yourself?

12:11.124 --> 12:13.958
What did you do to become a human being?

12:13.958 --> 12:18.291
Why this kind of egoistical behavior towards God?

12:18.750 --> 12:21.124
"Why God has made us? Why this thing?"

12:21.124 --> 12:23.833
Who are you to ask any question?

12:24.958 --> 12:27.708
But it is so, the questioning goes on,

12:27.708 --> 12:29.708
and such people are very dangerous

12:30.249 --> 12:31.833
for Sahaja Yoga.

12:32.917 --> 12:38.374
If they have to come for puja, I'm worried,

12:38.833 --> 12:41.374
not because anything will happen to puja,

12:41.374 --> 12:44.333
but we may lose them completely.

12:44.333 --> 12:47.917
Such egoistical stupid people get lost.

12:47.917 --> 12:52.208
As a mother I have simple compassion and love for them,

12:53.208 --> 12:58.000
and I feel sad that they could have been saved.

12:58.249 --> 13:00.666
But this questioning mind of theirs

13:00.666 --> 13:02.541
can drown them.

13:02.917 --> 13:04.666
This is the basic original sin

13:04.666 --> 13:07.333
that human beings have created.

13:07.833 --> 13:09.458
Apart from that,

13:09.708 --> 13:12.666
we had problem that we have come

13:12.917 --> 13:15.333
from animal stage to this stage.

13:15.666 --> 13:22.541
So there are animal brutal conditionings within you.

13:23.833 --> 13:27.333
Then we have gone through other conditionings,

13:27.666 --> 13:32.708
which were created in the history

13:33.000 --> 13:35.208
by the same mister "I"

13:35.792 --> 13:37.708
who has started institutions,

13:38.833 --> 13:41.333
who started organizing religions.

13:41.583 --> 13:44.000
For example, take Christianity.

13:44.917 --> 13:47.583
Christ came here to break your ego.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.541
On the contrary, people built a big ego out of it.

13:51.833 --> 13:54.500
Now, there are some Sahaja Yogis

13:54.750 --> 13:56.500
who believe that

13:56.875 --> 13:59.166
Sahaja Yoga is a Christian Sahaja Yoga

13:59.166 --> 14:01.124
or a Hindu Sahaja Yoga.

14:01.416 --> 14:05.416
Still that lingers on, that lingers on,

14:05.958 --> 14:08.291
that it is a Christian Sahaja Yoga.

14:08.291 --> 14:11.124
"For Christians it has to be Christian Sahaja Yoga"

14:11.750 --> 14:14.625
for Hindus it should be a Hindu Sahaja Yoga.

14:15.750 --> 14:18.166
"For Muslims it is a Muslim Sahaja Yoga;

14:18.416 --> 14:19.750
it must relate to Islam,"

14:19.750 --> 14:22.000
because they can't get out of their own conditioning,

14:22.249 --> 14:23.625
so it must relate to that,

14:23.875 --> 14:25.833
it must explain everything that is there.

14:25.833 --> 14:28.000
They can't get out, you see?

14:28.249 --> 14:30.500
It could be also a Catholic Sahaja Yoga

14:30.500 --> 14:32.500
or a Protestant Sahaja Yoga.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.124
Could be even deeper than that.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.124
Like that, you see, it goes on.

14:37.124 --> 14:39.042
So, you pull Sahaja Yoga

14:39.042 --> 14:40.583
into your own categories,

14:40.583 --> 14:43.166
into your own small little cups.

14:43.750 --> 14:46.000
But it's just the other way round.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.249
Sahaja Yoga is the ocean, is a universal thing,

14:50.249 --> 14:51.833
it is a MahaYoga.

14:52.082 --> 14:54.416
"It is not meant for Christians, Hindus, Muslims"

14:54.416 --> 14:59.042
it is meant for human beings as they were.

15:00.124 --> 15:02.750
Have you got animals who are Christians,

15:02.750 --> 15:04.708
Hindus or Muslims?

15:04.958 --> 15:07.708
This all comes because of the original sin only,

15:07.958 --> 15:10.124
that we are something, we are Christians,

15:10.124 --> 15:12.416
we are Hindus, we are Muslims.

15:12.416 --> 15:15.166
In Sahaja Yoga, one has to understand

15:15.166 --> 15:18.583
that all the rivers, whether it is the River Ganges

15:19.124 --> 15:20.875
or the River Yamuna

15:21.249 --> 15:23.042
or it is the River Thames

15:23.249 --> 15:25.124
or River Danube, any river,

15:25.374 --> 15:29.082
that all of them flow into the same ocean and become the ocean.

15:29.708 --> 15:31.541
They say that when all the rivers

15:31.541 --> 15:33.291
flow in the River Ganges,

15:33.541 --> 15:37.374
they are all called as Surasari, means "the River of the Gods."

15:37.374 --> 15:40.083
No more people call them by the different names

15:40.083 --> 15:43.541
of the tributaries that are there.

15:43.541 --> 15:46.416
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is the ocean.

15:46.708 --> 15:47.875
You cannot name it.

15:48.166 --> 15:52.500
Do not try to find its identity with other things.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.750
If you start doing that, then your mind

15:55.082 --> 15:59.750
will start becoming that small little cup.

16:00.249 --> 16:04.042
And moreover, if you are coming from some organized religions,

16:04.042 --> 16:06.958
its very important to understand that organized religions

16:07.208 --> 16:09.917
make your cup even stronger, it doesn't dissolve.

16:10.208 --> 16:11.541
If it is a disorganized religion,

16:11.541 --> 16:14.708
then it is a cup of earthenware,

16:14.958 --> 16:16.541
which can dissolve into this ocean.

16:16.792 --> 16:19.249
But if it is a solid, nice porcelain,

16:20.666 --> 16:23.958
Meissen, there is no possibility.

16:24.249 --> 16:27.124
Then you are adhering to all that conditioning,

16:27.792 --> 16:31.374
all that solidness, and then it's very difficult.

16:31.666 --> 16:33.958
All the time you have to bring in Christ

16:34.249 --> 16:36.208
or you have to bring in Mohammad

16:36.458 --> 16:38.083
or you have to bring in Zoroaster,

16:38.374 --> 16:42.208
or someone like that who should be there to guide you.

16:42.917 --> 16:45.249
Now your guidance is your Spirit,

16:45.249 --> 16:46.833
which is unlimited,

16:46.833 --> 16:49.042
so you don't have to bring any one of Them.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.458
They are all within you.

16:50.708 --> 16:52.500
They are all part and parcel of you.

16:52.750 --> 16:55.625
But to stick on to one person is again

16:55.625 --> 16:58.625
a sign that you are not expanding.

16:59.082 --> 17:01.458
You know that you are all.

17:01.458 --> 17:03.833
You have got Shri Krishna within you, who is awakened,

17:04.083 --> 17:05.541
you have got Christ within you,

17:05.917 --> 17:08.249
you have got Ganesha within you,

17:08.583 --> 17:10.458
you have got Brahmadeva within you,

17:10.792 --> 17:12.792
and you have got Mohammad within you.

17:13.083 --> 17:14.416
"And you have got all of Them:

17:14.708 --> 17:16.541
Moses, everyone, within you"

17:16.833 --> 17:19.583
so how can you be identified with one person?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.458
The reason is, you are still conditioned,

17:22.792 --> 17:26.416
and you want to drag it into your own conditioning.

17:27.792 --> 17:34.000
So try to bring it at a position where there is no conditioning.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.833
We can see our conditioning worse works so much

17:37.583 --> 17:40.042
with our style because,

17:40.374 --> 17:50.291
as human beings, we have a habit of forming a closed sect,

17:50.625 --> 17:51.875
"whether it is ourselves,

17:52.166 --> 17:56.166
first we close ourselves as "I." "I am XYZ."

17:56.500 --> 17:59.291
Then we can club together as,

17:59.708 --> 18:05.291
say, "We are, say, people who use fork and knives".

18:05.291 --> 18:07.833
There could be people who just use

18:07.833 --> 18:10.208
the fork and knives this way can be clubbed together,

18:10.208 --> 18:13.374
the others who use this way can be another way.

18:13.666 --> 18:15.082
See, it goes on like that,

18:15.333 --> 18:16.917
all kinds of stupidity

18:17.124 --> 18:18.833
that human beings have to club together.

18:18.833 --> 18:21.416
All right, use the way you like, makes no difference.

18:21.666 --> 18:25.208
You eat the same food, it digests the same way, it works the same.

18:25.458 --> 18:27.583
But as far as the outside is concerned,

18:27.833 --> 18:29.458
when it comes to human activity,

18:29.458 --> 18:31.500
they will use the fork and spoon in a different way,

18:31.500 --> 18:33.708
somebody will use their hands, fingers,

18:33.958 --> 18:36.917
and somebody will, I don't know, may use daggers.

18:36.917 --> 18:40.042
I don't know how they can manage to go to what limit.

18:40.458 --> 18:41.708
So, this is what it is.

18:41.708 --> 18:46.750
In doing something, in doing any activity,

18:47.082 --> 18:51.124
then only human beings make it a closed circuit,

18:51.416 --> 18:53.958
that "This is how we do it. This is how they do it,"

18:54.249 --> 19:00.583
how it is, the method of another party or people.

19:00.833 --> 19:03.249
This groupism is the worst of all,

19:03.583 --> 19:07.082
and is against the laws of nature.

19:07.082 --> 19:12.208
You can be individual, as far as your appearance is concerned,

19:12.458 --> 19:20.083
as far as your hair color is concerned,

19:20.333 --> 19:22.124
or your eye color is concerned

19:22.416 --> 19:24.458
that's that God has created you that way.

19:24.458 --> 19:29.083
But all other things that you have created are dead.

19:29.083 --> 19:33.083
All other clubbing methods you have created

19:33.083 --> 19:36.750
are absolutely of no value.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.458
They are just mythical.

19:38.792 --> 19:40.792
There's nothing truth in it,

19:40.792 --> 19:43.291
nothing that should be worthy considering.

19:43.541 --> 19:45.333
It is just a myth!

19:45.750 --> 19:49.583
So one has to understand that there is nothing

19:49.917 --> 19:52.666
like a Sahaja Yoga which is a Christian Sahaja Yoga,

19:53.000 --> 19:55.666
Sahaja Yoga which is a Protestant Sahaja Yoga

19:56.000 --> 19:57.583
or a Catholic Sahaja Yoga.

19:57.875 --> 20:01.291
I find this at a very subtle point,

20:01.541 --> 20:03.792
where people talk of collectivity,

20:04.082 --> 20:06.958
that they don't understand that we are not collective,

20:07.166 --> 20:09.750
because we have so many tags,

20:10.082 --> 20:11.625
you see, attached to us,

20:11.875 --> 20:18.082
like the conditionings of our own doings.

20:18.291 --> 20:20.083
It could be in Switzerland,

20:20.333 --> 20:21.750
it could be in Austria,

20:21.750 --> 20:25.792
it could be in Rome, or it could be in India, anywhere.

20:26.082 --> 20:28.082
These conditionings, we have to get rid of.

20:28.082 --> 20:30.958
We should know we are human beings, created by God,

20:31.249 --> 20:36.792
and whatever is within us that is real, created by Him,

20:37.208 --> 20:41.249
is the only thing that we have to be

20:41.500 --> 20:43.208
and all the rest of conditionings

20:43.458 --> 20:45.082
we should try to get rid.

20:45.917 --> 20:48.042
Everything is complementary.

20:48.249 --> 20:50.374
From this place you have to learn something,

20:50.708 --> 20:52.458
from that place you have to learn something.

20:53.708 --> 20:56.333
Every place has something to learn

20:56.792 --> 20:58.500
and to understand.

20:58.958 --> 21:03.166
And there is nothing that can be retained

21:03.625 --> 21:07.000
by some people as something higher or lower.

21:07.249 --> 21:10.583
But of course, where this ego has developed more,

21:11.082 --> 21:13.500
this original sin has developed more,

21:14.082 --> 21:15.833
there is a possibility

21:15.833 --> 21:22.166
that such human beings must have created more conditioning.

21:23.166 --> 21:25.792
Naturally the conditioning is much more.

21:25.792 --> 21:29.208
Or where they have been not at all moving

21:30.083 --> 21:31.249
about religion,

21:31.249 --> 21:34.333
about God, and have been sticking on,

21:34.625 --> 21:37.082
like, you can say, in Africa and all these places,

21:37.416 --> 21:40.333
could be that the conditioning

21:40.792 --> 21:43.792
could have been by the other forces,

21:44.082 --> 21:47.082
called as Adibhautik,

21:47.291 --> 21:50.666
means the ones which are created

21:51.083 --> 21:53.666
out of what God has created.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.541
Like, if they see the moon,

21:55.792 --> 21:57.541
they are afraid of the moon,

21:57.875 --> 21:58.875
if they see the trees,

21:59.083 --> 22:00.875
they are afraid of the trees.

22:01.166 --> 22:05.792
Sort of a mythical ideas about the nature itself.

22:06.208 --> 22:08.666
See, so there are two styles,

22:08.958 --> 22:10.208
as you always know.

22:10.500 --> 22:14.917
One is where they create mythical ideas

22:15.166 --> 22:16.541
about the nature,

22:16.792 --> 22:18.917
the mythical side of nature,

22:19.208 --> 22:21.166
that is Adibhautik

22:21.458 --> 22:24.000
and Adidaivik are the mythical ideas

22:24.208 --> 22:26.083
about what you can produce,

22:26.083 --> 22:32.166
you are God, you are the devas,

22:32.416 --> 22:33.792
and you want to create this.

22:33.792 --> 22:35.416
"I'm this, I'm that."

22:35.416 --> 22:39.166
So there are two types of conditionings which work out,

22:39.708 --> 22:42.500
and in modern times it is such a confused thing

22:42.833 --> 22:44.583
that both these sides,

22:44.583 --> 22:46.625
I don't know where they act.

22:46.917 --> 22:49.166
For example, the other day I was coming

22:50.042 --> 22:55.458
near the cemetery in Vienna,

22:55.750 --> 22:58.082
and I was amazed that it was a cemetery

22:58.333 --> 23:01.249
but it was catching on right Swadisthana.

23:01.249 --> 23:03.917
So I said, "All the bhoots must be acting now,

23:03.917 --> 23:06.374
because I can't understand how can

23:06.917 --> 23:10.666
a cemetery have a right Swadisthana?"

23:11.458 --> 23:13.208
This is how it can be explained,

23:13.541 --> 23:15.374
that all the bhoots are now active,

23:15.708 --> 23:17.708
or maybe they are again born, you see.

23:17.958 --> 23:19.792
They must have been dead hundreds of times,

23:20.042 --> 23:21.666
they must have created graves after graves

23:21.666 --> 23:24.833
and only there are empty graves, and they are active now.

23:24.833 --> 23:27.124
Or maybe that the bhutas themselves are active,

23:27.124 --> 23:28.166
they are no more there,

23:28.166 --> 23:30.833
they have all disappeared from there. It could be that.

23:31.124 --> 23:33.374
So we have to judge now on vibrations

23:33.374 --> 23:35.082
and not on our understanding

23:35.374 --> 23:39.124
or what we think or what we understand

23:39.124 --> 23:40.374
through this brain.

23:40.625 --> 23:44.500
By asking questions and by talking too much about it,

23:44.500 --> 23:46.374
you cannot understand Sahaja Yoga.

23:46.625 --> 23:48.082
For Sahaja Yoga you have to have

23:48.291 --> 23:49.875
that super state of mind,

23:50.166 --> 23:51.875
where you can receive vibrations,

23:52.124 --> 23:54.500
can feel vibrations and have to be

23:54.750 --> 23:57.374
absolutely compromised on them.

23:57.374 --> 24:02.458
If there is still the tag of that ego so much

24:02.458 --> 24:04.416
that you still question Sahaja Yoga

24:04.792 --> 24:06.541
and think no end of yourself,

24:06.541 --> 24:08.124
it is better that such a person

24:08.124 --> 24:10.042
should not attend the pujas,

24:10.291 --> 24:12.875
not attend the pujas. It is kind to himself.

24:13.083 --> 24:14.917
It is being nice to himself that

24:14.917 --> 24:17.917
such a person who has doubts should not attend a puja,

24:18.208 --> 24:20.000
because puja is only meant for people

24:20.208 --> 24:22.708
who have achieved, received that state of mind

24:22.708 --> 24:24.917
which is called as Nirvikalpa,

24:24.917 --> 24:27.750
where there is no vikalpa, where there is no doubt in your mind.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.625
If there are still doubts in your mind,

24:29.958 --> 24:32.666
your mind is still very powerful,

24:32.666 --> 24:34.625
and it is going to put you down.

24:34.958 --> 24:37.833
So either before puja you tell your mind to keep quiet.

24:37.833 --> 24:40.124
"Tell him not to talk now,

24:40.416 --> 24:43.708
Better keep quiet, now I have to ascend"

24:44.333 --> 24:46.792
and I have to receive the blessings of the Divine.

24:47.042 --> 24:50.124
"So just keep quiet, and if you cannot keep quiet

24:51.042 --> 24:53.374
then I cannot ascend."

24:53.708 --> 24:56.458
I have told you many a times it is like a donkey,

24:56.833 --> 24:59.208
mind is just like a donkey.

24:59.750 --> 25:02.458
If you go behind the donkey, it kicks you,

25:03.000 --> 25:04.083
it will tell you,

25:04.333 --> 25:07.083
"that you are the bad man, you are the worst man"

25:07.333 --> 25:09.083
all the self-pity will come into you.

25:09.333 --> 25:11.875
If you go ahead with the donkey,

25:12.083 --> 25:15.583
then he'll put his ears to you, you can hold him like an ego, you see.

25:15.583 --> 25:18.541
You can go wherever you want, do what you like, "What's wrong?"

25:18.875 --> 25:20.416
It will not control you.

25:20.416 --> 25:22.500
If you sit on top of the donkey

25:22.750 --> 25:26.500
it will still play about with you, to see how you work out.

25:27.333 --> 25:31.333
So if you allow the mind to go here and there,

25:31.792 --> 25:34.792
through your eyes or through your attention, or anywhere,

25:35.124 --> 25:38.208
or through your tongue or your senses, it will say, "All right."

25:38.208 --> 25:40.458
It will eat the grass on the sides, it won't move.

25:40.458 --> 25:42.875
It will move this side, eat some grass, that side.

25:43.124 --> 25:44.792
Gregoire: At this stage, as You speak about it,

25:45.042 --> 25:46.833
should I quickly translate for the French

25:46.833 --> 25:48.166
who don't understand English?

25:48.166 --> 25:49.625
Oh, you want to translate the whole thing?

25:49.625 --> 25:51.124
Gregoire: I can in two minutes.

25:51.124 --> 25:53.333
I think later on, Gregoire, would be better,

25:53.583 --> 25:57.792
if you could translate, because the flow is better now all right?

25:59.625 --> 26:06.249
So this donkey, the donkey wants to eat the grass.

26:06.249 --> 26:08.917
He knows that you don't mind him eating the grass.

26:08.917 --> 26:10.708
All right, it goes round, eats grass,

26:10.958 --> 26:13.042
all sorts of dirt, filth, whatever it is.

26:13.042 --> 26:15.833
Whatever you allow he eats, goes on eating,

26:15.833 --> 26:17.708
all filthy things, all filthy thoughts,

26:17.958 --> 26:19.875
all dirty thoughts and every sort of thing,

26:19.875 --> 26:21.500
without questioning, you see?

26:21.500 --> 26:23.625
Only in Sahaja Yoga they come here and question,

26:23.625 --> 26:26.374
but not when they have to eat filth and dirt and all kinds

26:26.625 --> 26:31.042
of unholy things and sinful things, they never question.

26:31.625 --> 26:33.249
Then they'll say, "What's wrong?"

26:33.249 --> 26:36.166
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga they will question.

26:36.708 --> 26:38.458
Which is the holiest of holy?

26:39.458 --> 26:41.166
Which is the greatest of greatest?

26:41.500 --> 26:43.166
Only these gates are open to you.

26:43.166 --> 26:46.249
That's how you get it otherwise it is not,

26:46.500 --> 26:49.750
it's prohibited to all the people to achieve this.

26:52.875 --> 26:59.042
The water that washes My feet is the ambrosia,

27:00.291 --> 27:02.249
is the tirtha,

27:02.583 --> 27:06.082
which was even prohibited to doctors in olden days.

27:06.082 --> 27:09.291
Vaidyas were not allowed, and they had to fight for.

27:09.583 --> 27:11.625
Only the Gods were allowed to drink it.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.291
Only the Gods were allowed to drink it.

27:14.583 --> 27:16.708
Today you are placed at the position of Gods.

27:16.708 --> 27:19.166
But are you capable of that?

27:19.500 --> 27:22.124
Are you deserving that?

27:22.458 --> 27:23.833
Or you are still questioning,

27:24.082 --> 27:26.249
you have still problems?

27:26.625 --> 27:29.166
Then it is better you are prohibited.

27:29.458 --> 27:33.708
It's a rare thing that you should take that ambrosia.

27:34.792 --> 27:36.541
It's in the Devi Purana Bhagavatam,

27:36.541 --> 27:39.666
if you read, that they were prohibited to take it.

27:40.000 --> 27:41.042
So this is what it is,

27:41.291 --> 27:44.166
that the mind goes like a donkey.

27:44.416 --> 27:49.583
But if the donkey knows the one who is the rider,

27:50.917 --> 27:52.333
knows his ways,

27:53.166 --> 27:55.291
and he knows how to control the mind

27:55.291 --> 27:57.958
and he knows where it has to work,

27:57.958 --> 28:01.042
the same donkey, the same instruments,

28:01.042 --> 28:02.249
the same institutions,

28:02.249 --> 28:05.124
the same things you have got around you,

28:05.708 --> 28:09.166
will take you there with a faster speed,

28:10.249 --> 28:12.500
with a very comfortable thing.

28:12.500 --> 28:15.249
So tell your mind today,

28:15.583 --> 28:18.249
that we have had enough of it,

28:18.500 --> 28:19.583
playing with the mind.

28:19.833 --> 28:25.042
Now we want to be there in the realm of God.

28:58.500 --> 29:00.458
Tell your mind, fully, tell your mind.

29:00.458 --> 29:01.583
It is important.

29:01.583 --> 29:04.124
This is the mind which has taken you to all kinds of things

29:04.458 --> 29:07.042
it has given you all the filth and dirt and all that.

29:07.333 --> 29:09.666
So just tell your mind.

29:29.458 --> 29:31.249
May God bless you!

29:32.208 --> 29:34.000
So for today's theme,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.583
we should say that we have to achieve

29:36.833 --> 29:39.792
our innocence within ourselves,

29:40.249 --> 29:43.249
and feel the innocence of the Virata.

29:43.666 --> 29:47.208
The question of Ganesha Virata,

29:47.208 --> 29:49.083
we can say, or Virata Ganesha,

29:49.333 --> 29:53.208
where, in the Virata, the innocence we have to feel,

29:53.458 --> 29:58.124
so that we become innocent, our sins are washed out,

29:59.042 --> 30:04.208
that we are cleansed by that innocence,

30:05.208 --> 30:08.583
"so that this "I-ness" is lost from you,"

30:08.833 --> 30:13.124
this original sin is washed away from us,

30:13.416 --> 30:17.833
and we become that beautiful being

30:18.666 --> 30:23.583
who is the proud child of God,

30:25.124 --> 30:31.249
and who is the prize of this creation.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.249
May God bless you!

30:36.249 --> 30:37.833
Now you can translate, Gregoire.

30:38.124 --> 30:39.666
It's all right. You can translate.

30:39.666 --> 30:41.583
I know it is long, but sometimes

30:41.833 --> 30:43.583
I find that if the flow is not kept...

30:43.583 --> 30:46.208
Gregoire: I'm sorry, Mother, I should not have interrupted.

30:46.458 --> 30:48.208
No, it's all right, it's all right.

30:55.708 --> 30:57.917
You can replay, and in that background

30:57.917 --> 31:00.124
you will be able to, keep it low,

31:00.416 --> 31:02.333
so that you can spontaneously

31:02.583 --> 31:04.416
go on saying something.

31:04.416 --> 31:07.917
Will it be all right? To replay?

31:10.666 --> 31:14.000
That will give you a proper...

31:14.000 --> 31:15.958
Gregoire: I was just thinking three minutes for the French,

31:15.958 --> 31:17.249
and three minutes for the Italian,

31:17.500 --> 31:18.541
in a very condensed manner.

31:18.833 --> 31:19.500
You can?

31:19.500 --> 31:20.500
Gregoire: I can, yes.

31:20.500 --> 31:21.875
All right.

37:10.124 --> 37:13.666
Many people ask Me, before also, that,

37:13.917 --> 37:16.249
"Mother, why we became like this?"

37:16.583 --> 37:20.208
Why didn't God just made us aware of ourselves,

37:20.541 --> 37:22.708
without committing all these mistakes?

37:22.708 --> 37:28.083
"And why we had to go through this all vicious circle?"

37:29.124 --> 37:31.333
At that time, I didn't want to say that

37:31.792 --> 37:33.708
you have committed the original sin,

37:34.083 --> 37:35.458
that you have disobeyed God.

37:35.708 --> 37:38.000
Otherwise things would have worked out in a different way,

37:38.208 --> 37:39.458
not have been so lengthy.

37:40.083 --> 37:42.333
Because if you tell them that, then there is another thing

37:42.333 --> 37:45.583
that happens to them is that they become left-sided

37:45.583 --> 37:47.374
that they start feeling guilty about the original sin, you see.

37:48.792 --> 37:52.042
So we have to jump from ego to the original sin part of it.

37:52.374 --> 37:57.042
But that part of you avoid, only one can say, in the beginning,

37:57.249 --> 38:00.708
that evolution could not take place

38:00.708 --> 38:03.249
without this freedom being given to you, you see,

38:03.249 --> 38:05.249
because freedom was first tested,

38:05.249 --> 38:06.792
that you were given a freedom.

38:07.042 --> 38:08.458
You had a nice place to live in,

38:08.708 --> 38:12.792
you lived in the complete protection of God,

38:12.792 --> 38:15.208
in the garden of Eden, you can say,

38:15.208 --> 38:17.500
in the beautiful... everything was wonderful.

38:17.792 --> 38:19.374
Nothing was missing there.

38:19.374 --> 38:21.583
But, despite that, human beings, you see,

38:21.583 --> 38:22.958
when they had the freedom,

38:22.958 --> 38:26.333
just the freedom was going to be tested,

38:26.583 --> 38:30.124
immediately they took to these baser things, you see.

38:30.374 --> 38:32.958
And that is the way God had

38:32.958 --> 38:34.958
to then change the whole plans,

38:35.208 --> 38:39.333
because the baser things of life were attractive,

38:39.583 --> 38:43.042
even with all the blessings that they had.

38:43.333 --> 38:46.583
All the animosity and the, we can say,

38:46.583 --> 38:48.958
all the animal feelings, we can say,

38:49.374 --> 38:51.333
were still attractive to human beings,

38:51.333 --> 38:54.958
and that's what was most surprising.

38:54.958 --> 38:56.958
And when these things happened,

38:57.208 --> 38:59.042
naturally the freedom itself

38:59.042 --> 39:01.792
had to go through the test of improvement.

39:02.083 --> 39:07.833
And that test was all this whole creation of human beings

39:07.833 --> 39:09.083
that took place.

39:09.083 --> 39:11.000
But to tell them all that

39:11.000 --> 39:13.666
"That it is only the original sin which has created a problem."

39:13.958 --> 39:14.750
Then they feel then,

39:14.750 --> 39:17.416
"Oh, God, why did You create the original sin?"

39:17.666 --> 39:20.083
So it is better to tell them that it is inevitable,

39:20.500 --> 39:23.208
for your evolutionary process,

39:23.500 --> 39:25.208
that your freedom must be tested,

39:25.541 --> 39:27.792
because if you have to enter

39:28.208 --> 39:30.000
into the supreme freedom,

39:30.208 --> 39:31.333
you must first know

39:31.625 --> 39:33.083
whether you can bear it or not.

39:33.416 --> 39:34.792
And in seeing that ...

39:37.541 --> 39:39.166
So, it took so many years

39:39.500 --> 39:42.333
for human beings to grow into it, to understand that

39:42.625 --> 39:44.792
the man cannot bear anything. He cannot bear freedom,

39:45.083 --> 39:47.291
he cannot bear money, he cannot bear position,

39:47.541 --> 39:49.958
he cannot bear comfort, he cannot bear anything.

39:50.291 --> 39:52.333
And that's what now we are seeing in Sahaja Yoga also:

39:52.625 --> 39:55.082
when they get comfort, they they are just sitting down again.

39:56.082 --> 39:58.625
When they get any blessings of material wealth,

39:59.000 --> 40:01.666
it will happen which it was, again the same,

40:02.000 --> 40:04.541
that Garden of Eden is coming back to you,

40:04.792 --> 40:06.416
and when it starts coming back to you,

40:06.875 --> 40:09.416
again you go back to the same stage. It's not good.

40:09.750 --> 40:13.291
Now you must understand that you have to be supreme,

40:13.625 --> 40:14.958
so you must master all this.

40:15.166 --> 40:16.625
Nothing is important, nothing is important,

40:16.958 --> 40:18.416
only the Spirit is important.

40:18.666 --> 40:19.958
Then only you can get out of ...

40:19.958 --> 40:23.166
This is also can act as a temptation for you, you see.

40:23.750 --> 40:26.833
All the blessings that are coming to you are temptations.

40:27.082 --> 40:28.042
So you should be prepared.

40:28.042 --> 40:32.082
Nothing is more important than the Spirit, you see.

40:32.082 --> 40:35.833
We are prepared for any kind of thing to achieve the Spirit.

40:36.249 --> 40:39.166
We are not bothered as to what blessings we get or anything.

40:39.458 --> 40:41.708
But what we want is the freedom of Spirit

40:41.958 --> 40:43.958
which is not hankering after anything,

40:44.374 --> 40:46.333
hankering after material things,

40:46.708 --> 40:49.458
so that you will be like a lamp

40:49.917 --> 40:51.750
which is giving light,

40:52.042 --> 40:54.082
without getting involved into the lamp itself.

40:54.333 --> 40:56.625
Whether it is of gold or silver or anything,

40:57.833 --> 41:01.833
it can burn, the light, even if it is made of mud.

41:01.833 --> 41:04.166
That's what is to be achieved by Sahaja Yogis,

41:04.416 --> 41:07.792
to be understood because this is a very precarious stage where,

41:08.082 --> 41:10.750
I find, people are again drifting down.

45:22.124 --> 45:24.917
So now we have to humble down ourselves,

45:25.583 --> 45:28.833
to say, "I have not known anything, Mother, so far, I have to know."

45:29.083 --> 45:31.249
Because, this is the knowledge of the root,

45:31.583 --> 45:32.583
which you do not know.

45:32.917 --> 45:34.042
This is a new knowledge for you. What can you question about?

45:35.083 --> 45:36.458
You don't know anything.

45:36.708 --> 45:39.083
You have to know about the knowledge of the root.

45:39.333 --> 45:40.583
So humble down yourself,

45:41.000 --> 45:44.541
and then only, you will receive the blessings of this new growth.

45:44.875 --> 45:50.291
That is the growth that is inward, inside, the Antar Yoga.

45:50.583 --> 45:53.541
Unless and until you humble down, it won't work out.

45:53.792 --> 45:54.792
You have to humble down,

45:55.042 --> 45:57.792
because as soon as you start asking questions,

45:57.792 --> 45:59.792
it's your ego that is asking questions.

46:00.042 --> 46:02.333
So humble down and to grow into it,

46:02.666 --> 46:07.917
and to go further with the knowledge of the roots.

46:09.416 --> 46:14.416
It is surprising that in India only this knowledge

46:14.750 --> 46:16.541
has been really sought after,

46:16.792 --> 46:18.708
and people have gone very deep down.

46:19.042 --> 46:21.750
That's why every one of them had to come to India.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.416
Even Christ came to India to know about

46:24.750 --> 46:29.666
how people are searching it out, to support them, to help them.

46:29.917 --> 46:35.541
So it is important that the knowledge of the root has to be done

46:35.792 --> 46:39.583
in the area where it is more possible.

46:40.083 --> 46:42.750
"It is easier to do where the roots are not disturbed"

46:43.000 --> 46:45.208
and that's what was the country, India,

46:45.458 --> 46:47.000
where people searched it out.

46:47.208 --> 46:49.000
"But when they started growing out again,

46:49.208 --> 46:50.708
they became stupid and foolish"

46:50.708 --> 46:53.333
and when we see them, we see them, they're outside.

46:53.750 --> 46:57.416
But we don't see what tremendous work

46:57.792 --> 47:00.541
the seers have put in India, tremendous.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.416
I mean, you take one of them and it is sufficient

47:03.416 --> 47:05.124
to give you a full idea of Sahaja Yoga.

47:05.416 --> 47:09.666
You take a simple person, a very simple person like,

47:10.042 --> 47:15.416
say, Sai Nath, who was, to look at, very simple,

47:15.666 --> 47:18.000
but what tremendous ocean of knowledge he had.

47:18.416 --> 47:20.458
Who was not educated or anything.

47:20.750 --> 47:22.875
Nobody knows where He was born, what happened,

47:22.875 --> 47:25.541
from where He came and where He lived,

47:25.792 --> 47:27.666
and how He came up to that age.

47:27.666 --> 47:31.458
No one knows about His background.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.666
Or you take Adi Sankaracharya,

47:34.917 --> 47:38.416
or you can take Kabira, or anyone.

47:38.750 --> 47:40.792
For example, you take Machindranath.

47:41.124 --> 47:44.416
If you read about Machindranath, you won't know,

47:44.708 --> 47:49.042
you'll think it's some sort of a mysterious knowledge he's giving.

47:50.000 --> 47:51.583
It's a tremendous work they did!

47:51.875 --> 47:55.000
They went into all the left and the right, and everything they did,

47:56.208 --> 47:58.042
all kinds of experimentations.

47:58.291 --> 48:01.042
If you see the books they have written about the Nav Naths,

48:01.042 --> 48:03.541
the Nine Nathas, and about Machindra's life.

48:03.875 --> 48:08.541
Machindranath went into such depth, and he found out so much

48:09.042 --> 48:11.208
about the places where women were rulers.

48:11.458 --> 48:15.042
I think it must be the Belgian place he must have been,

48:15.875 --> 48:17.124
"where women were the rulers and

48:17.416 --> 48:19.000
husbands were just like cabbages"

48:19.000 --> 48:22.249
and this and that and all kinds of things He discovered and then,

48:22.541 --> 48:24.792
what happened and how he tried to cure that.

48:25.208 --> 48:27.208
It's the movement in another direction, you see,

48:27.458 --> 48:29.042
in the root direction, that how

48:29.249 --> 48:31.792
these roots have gone and given rise

48:31.792 --> 48:36.124
to such horrible trees here and there and that's how he worked out.

48:36.124 --> 48:41.249
And it's such a symbolic thing that you to understand their work,

48:41.583 --> 48:43.833
you have to be really very deep

48:44.082 --> 48:48.249
and very penetrating for which

48:49.082 --> 48:53.208
the human mind so far is not able to see

48:53.458 --> 48:55.042
the amount of work they have done.

48:55.249 --> 48:56.792
It's not possible to see.

48:57.082 --> 49:00.249
Like, if you see Adi Shankaracharya's descriptions

49:00.500 --> 49:02.917
or that even Markandeya's description about your Mother,

49:03.875 --> 49:08.000
it's remarkable how little-little things He could see.

49:08.000 --> 49:09.708
From where, from what angles.

49:10.082 --> 49:15.082
And every little bit of Mother he could see,

49:15.082 --> 49:16.833
as a child would see,

49:17.082 --> 49:19.249
you see, absolutely close to the Mother.

49:19.500 --> 49:23.374
That means the innocence was complete and perfected.

49:23.750 --> 49:26.124
Otherwise you can't see these points that they have seen,

49:26.500 --> 49:28.875
all the little things like the three folds of the Mother.

49:29.166 --> 49:30.291
How can anyone see,

49:30.541 --> 49:33.750
but child can see that three folds of the mothers are there,

49:34.082 --> 49:36.083
that she has three folds in her body.

49:36.374 --> 49:38.166
Only a child can see.

49:38.541 --> 49:40.249
It's tremendous, I tell you,

49:40.249 --> 49:42.374
it's tremendous that innocence

49:42.374 --> 49:45.625
their penetration and their courage.

49:45.875 --> 49:49.082
Need real courage to grow into that penetration.

49:49.374 --> 49:53.500
So innocence is the thing which one has to achieve first of all,

49:53.958 --> 49:57.541
but it should not be like this through Christ or through Ganesha,

49:57.875 --> 49:59.958
it should be you who should have it.

50:00.166 --> 50:03.166
Means you are, you are the innocence.

50:03.416 --> 50:05.000
You don't have to say that,

50:05.291 --> 50:07.291
you don't have to come through someone.

50:07.541 --> 50:12.875
You are that, you just directly can have.

50:13.416 --> 50:16.958
That business is meant for people who are not realized,

50:17.166 --> 50:18.833
meant for people who are stupid,

50:19.124 --> 50:21.750
meant for people who can not directly attain.

50:22.000 --> 50:23.708
You all can directly attain it.

50:23.708 --> 50:25.833
That is your blessing, that's the greatest thing

50:26.082 --> 50:28.374
that you can directly achieve all that.

50:28.708 --> 50:31.750
But you have to get to that position of innocence

50:31.750 --> 50:34.875
by which you become so subtle, so sukshma,

50:35.124 --> 50:38.166
because innocence is the subtlest thing that you enter into

50:38.166 --> 50:42.750
all the areas to know the knowledge of the roots,

50:43.291 --> 50:46.374
knowledge of the Tree of Life.

50:46.708 --> 50:50.625
And it's not meant for the stupid egoistical nonsensical people.

50:50.625 --> 50:53.000
They become rakshasas I tell you, they are rakshasas.

50:53.416 --> 50:55.166
So we are not going to go their way,

50:55.541 --> 50:57.082
we have to go the other way round.

50:57.082 --> 50:59.500
So we have to humble down within ourselves

50:59.875 --> 51:02.374
and try to awaken your innocence,

51:02.958 --> 51:05.625
once that is the holy innocence,

51:06.000 --> 51:07.666
that pavitra innocence within you.

51:15.500 --> 51:20.708
In Sanskrit language there's no word for innocence, to the surprise.

51:21.416 --> 51:24.875
Because for them whatever is the holy, auspicious, everything,

51:25.124 --> 51:28.291
there's no word, separated from innocence,

51:28.291 --> 51:33.082
because they can't think that there can be innocence

51:33.291 --> 51:35.000
existing in the air like that.

51:35.249 --> 51:38.124
It has to be inside something, you see,

51:38.374 --> 51:43.124
it is always sort of a cup can only contain the water like that.

51:43.374 --> 51:44.500
So they can not think,

51:44.750 --> 51:48.249
they can not think of water hanging in the air like that, you see.

51:48.500 --> 51:50.082
It has to have some cup.

51:50.416 --> 51:52.124
"So they will say "auspicious time,"

51:52.625 --> 51:55.625
"auspicious person" or

51:55.958 --> 51:59.833
"auspicious thing", "auspicious night",

52:00.124 --> 52:01.374
"auspicious day."

52:01.625 --> 52:06.541
Everything is contained,

52:06.833 --> 52:08.541
container, like a container.

52:08.958 --> 52:11.500
The container that can have innocence, you see.

52:11.833 --> 52:15.750
So the auspiciosness. Again, auspicious. It's an adjective.

52:17.374 --> 52:22.750
There is nothing like saying that this is

52:22.750 --> 52:24.958
a solid innocence, the shubbha.

52:25.166 --> 52:27.166
Shubbha itself is an adjective,

52:27.416 --> 52:30.416
there's no noun for innocence.

52:30.416 --> 52:33.416
Innocent it can be, but innocence itself

52:34.625 --> 52:36.000
doesn't exist for them

52:36.000 --> 52:39.166
Because it exists everywhere that is innocent.

52:40.541 --> 52:41.708
It's such a wider idea,

52:42.000 --> 52:45.875
it's a wider idea of the Virat Ganesha.

52:46.249 --> 52:50.082
When He is in the whole of Virata,

52:50.541 --> 52:53.416
how can you put Him down as вЂ˜innocence'?

52:55.374 --> 52:57.833
Is so much subtle,

52:58.082 --> 53:01.958
too subtle to be made into a noun.

53:03.374 --> 53:05.249
too subtle a thing,

53:05.625 --> 53:07.958
and we have to become that subtle.

53:10.625 --> 53:12.500
May God bless you all!

53:41.875 --> 53:44.750
You can start washing My Feet.

53:45.750 --> 53:48.458
First, what we can do,

53:48.750 --> 53:51.625
that those who have not washed My Feet

53:51.875 --> 54:03.792
please raise your hands вЂ“ so far. вЂ¦He has not washed?

54:06.291 --> 54:08.750
All right, come.

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:26.750
These are the twenty-one names,

01:15:27.374 --> 01:15:29.333
these are the Twenty-One Names

01:15:29.666 --> 01:15:35.500
of Shri Vishnu which is the aspect of your evolution,

01:15:36.083 --> 01:15:37.416
of your dharma.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.625
First the sustenance and then evolution.

01:15:41.666 --> 01:15:46.000
That's the Father within you.

01:15:46.416 --> 01:15:51.625
And so first because you are all seeking your evolution

01:15:52.792 --> 01:15:57.000
we invoke the twenty-one powers,

01:15:57.208 --> 01:16:04.291
twenty-one powers of this Father aspect of God.

01:16:04.291 --> 01:16:06.083
Twenty-one powers.

01:16:07.208 --> 01:16:11.666
These are the twenty-one names which represent

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.374
the twenty-one powers of evolution within us.

01:16:17.875 --> 01:16:20.625
Sushumna Channel has got

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.291
twenty-one powers.

01:16:26.625 --> 01:16:30.082
You can translate, in French it's better.

01:16:33.666 --> 01:16:36.917
Vishnu, Vishnu, it's the Vishnu power or,

01:16:37.124 --> 01:16:39.083
we can say, the Narayana.

01:16:39.083 --> 01:16:40.958
Vishnu is the Father.

01:22:09.333 --> 01:22:11.249
Krita Yuga. This is the Krita Yuga.

01:22:11.249 --> 01:22:14.500
Krita means when where it will be effective,

01:22:15.958 --> 01:22:17.792
when where it is going to be effective.

01:22:18.042 --> 01:22:19.958
The work will be done. This is the Yuga,

01:22:19.958 --> 01:22:21.500
the times where it will be done.

01:22:21.792 --> 01:22:23.082
Krita Yuga.

01:22:23.333 --> 01:22:25.708
This is the special time which is in between

01:22:25.708 --> 01:22:27.124
Kali Yuga and Satya Yuga,

01:22:27.374 --> 01:22:30.082
is the Krita Yuga where things will be done,

01:22:30.333 --> 01:22:32.042
work will be done.

01:22:32.333 --> 01:22:33.333
Resurrection time

01:22:33.333 --> 01:22:34.583
where your hands will speak.

01:22:34.833 --> 01:22:38.458
This is the thing. You see. Translate it.

01:22:39.458 --> 01:22:42.249
"Krita Yuga. "Kri" means "to do."

01:34:54.541 --> 01:34:57.917
See, svatojayte, means the principle,

01:34:58.166 --> 01:35:01.917
you awaken the principle of the whole universe,

01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:06.000
the principle of the universe and Pratye

01:35:06.208 --> 01:35:11.458
means you give also the experience of that,

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.875
so that he is the one who generates the principle

01:35:16.291 --> 01:35:18.875
and also he gives you the experience.

01:35:31.291 --> 01:35:34.625
pratye, pratye is the experience that proves,

01:35:37.708 --> 01:35:40.875
that proves your existence, you see.

01:35:41.124 --> 01:35:44.416
You give your own pratye, means you give your experience

01:35:44.833 --> 01:35:47.291
by which it proves that you exist.

01:46:14.291 --> 01:46:17.124
It should be "You are God in man", it would be better.

01:46:17.708 --> 01:46:19.708
God in man.

01:46:23.500 --> 01:46:25.708
He is not man, by any chance,

01:46:26.374 --> 01:46:28.374
how can you call Him?
