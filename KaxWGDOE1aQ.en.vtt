00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:23.927
It was such a surprise to see you all in that procession.

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:28.551
Actually I was waiting and waiting, and I thought,

00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:32.969
“Why these people are not coming to call Me for Puja?”

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:38.425
It was a beautiful surprise, it’s very joy giving.

00:00:57.208 --> 00:01:08.295
The joy was dancing in your eyes.

00:01:08.415 --> 00:01:12.277
I could see the lights in your eyes

00:01:14.212 --> 00:01:17.128
and this is the real Diwali.

00:01:17.248 --> 00:01:23.390
Diwali word comes from two words: ‘dipa’ and ‘awali’.

00:01:23.723 --> 00:01:29.013
Dipa means, you know, lights, and awali means rows,

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.948
rows and rows of lights.

00:01:32.068 --> 00:01:35.777
Seems it’s a very, very ancient idea

00:01:35.897 --> 00:01:37.640
and all over in the world, you see,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.461
whenever they have to celebrate something

00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:48.164
then they put lights. And lights because light gives joy,

00:01:48.284 --> 00:01:50.380
gives happiness.

00:01:52.443 --> 00:01:56.597
So to overcome the darkness of ignorance

00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:01.906
also we have to enlighten ourselves.

00:02:03.953 --> 00:02:07.440
And that is why is important that everybody

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.838
should get Self-realization

00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:13.730
to feel the light within themselves.

00:02:15.782 --> 00:02:19.414
And you must have noticed that after realization

00:02:19.534 --> 00:02:21.891
the eyes also sparkle.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.991
There’s light in the eyes of every Sahaja yogi.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:36.083
Today is the day when we worship the Lakshmi,

00:02:37.273 --> 00:02:42.566
Lakshmi principle, which is in our Nabhi.

00:02:44.582 --> 00:02:47.279
Lakshmi principle that is understood,

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:51.402
I’ve told you many a time, described Lakshmi to you

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.351
that She stands on a lotus

00:02:56.255 --> 00:02:59.624
and She has two lotuses in Her hands.

00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:09.631
That means She’s so benevolent, so kind

00:03:10.345 --> 00:03:13.273
that She doesn’t pressurize anyone.

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:16.288
But normally you don’t find that.

00:03:16.408 --> 00:03:21.502
Anybody who has money, he’ll just try to pressurize

00:03:21.622 --> 00:03:23.432
or try to push down.

00:03:23.552 --> 00:03:26.477
Even in Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen people like that.

00:03:26.597 --> 00:03:30.385
If they are little better off, they try to push people,

00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:33.961
organize them, to control them

00:03:35.071 --> 00:03:37.496
as if they think this is a power they have got

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:39.865
out of the money that they have.

00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:43.545
But She Herself stands on a lotus

00:03:45.227 --> 00:03:51.349
– that means on the beauty. The beauty of Her being

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:56.593
is shown that She doesn’t trouble anyone,

00:03:56.713 --> 00:03:59.884
She can stand on a flower.

00:04:01.693 --> 00:04:05.834
So the first thing, those who have to worship Lakshmi

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:08.073
have to remember one thing

00:04:08.193 --> 00:04:12.365
that they are not to pressurize anyone,

00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:19.813
to push anyone, to control anyone or destroy.

00:04:19.933 --> 00:04:25.060
But She with Her feet on the lotuses nourishes the lotus.

00:04:25.774 --> 00:04:29.995
In Her two hands She has got lotuses.

00:04:30.115 --> 00:04:36.042
Lotus is a sign of beauty and they being pink, is love.

00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:42.696
So what does it symbolize?

00:04:42.953 --> 00:04:47.397
That a person who has Lakshmi, who has money, who has wealth

00:04:47.517 --> 00:04:54.345
should be extremely generous, like a lotus which allows

00:04:54.465 --> 00:05:07.930
a horrible gnat-like, black, porky, poking type, little beetle

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.856
also to come into it and to sleep.

00:05:11.976 --> 00:05:19.911
And She provides in the lotus a beautiful bed of comfort

00:05:20.031 --> 00:05:25.641
to such a person. He is black, he’s got thorns in it,

00:05:25.761 --> 00:05:29.844
but he’s coming to rest, surrendered.

00:05:29.964 --> 00:05:34.006
And then She covers it with Her petals

00:05:34.126 --> 00:05:39.266
and makes it comfortable and protected.

00:05:39.386 --> 00:05:46.806
So for a person who has money that should be the temperament,

00:05:46.926 --> 00:05:50.377
otherwise he loses his money very fast.

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.419
Or he’s always insecured about his money.

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.366
He doesn’t know what to do. He wants to put money here,

00:05:56.486 --> 00:05:58.862
hide there, hide there, hide there.

00:06:00.378 --> 00:06:03.581
And there’s no grace about such a person.

00:06:04.247 --> 00:06:08.203
And the house is such that you never feel comfortable

00:06:08.323 --> 00:06:11.202
because all the time they’re worried the carpet will be spoiled,

00:06:11.323 --> 00:06:14.209
this will be spoiled, that will be spoiled, that should not be so.

00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:17.700
What’s the use of having such a house which gives you a headache?

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.761
I mean [it’s] common sense!

00:06:21.236 --> 00:06:23.842
A house should be such where you can live freely,

00:06:23.962 --> 00:06:26.055
at least a house should be like that.

00:06:26.175 --> 00:06:29.346
But the soon we become materialistic

00:06:29.466 --> 00:06:32.310
we get out of our Lakshmi principle.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.688
All the beauty of our wealth is finished.

00:06:37.808 --> 00:06:41.960
I’ve seen people that even a rat doesn’t enter their house,

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.130
leave alone human beings.

00:06:44.329 --> 00:06:49.351
They polish their silver, they polish their brass,

00:06:49.471 --> 00:06:52.549
they polish their furniture,

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:59.255
their beautiful house is done with beautiful paper,

00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:03.652
expensive things. But a rat also doesn’t enter.

00:07:05.651 --> 00:07:10.805
And this is what is the Western materialism is:

00:07:10.925 --> 00:07:14.902
that we get so much worried about everything.

00:07:15.022 --> 00:07:17.548
I asked them, “Why are you so much worried?”

00:07:17.668 --> 00:07:20.209
They said, “Because it’s an investment

00:07:20.329 --> 00:07:22.490
and we have to sell the house.”

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.974
Everything is an investment,

00:07:24.094 --> 00:07:26.331
they themselves are investments, I think.

00:07:26.451 --> 00:07:28.282
How will they enjoy?

00:07:29.107 --> 00:07:30.553
They cannot enjoy their wealth

00:07:30.673 --> 00:07:33.846
because everything seems to be an investment.

00:07:33.966 --> 00:07:36.488
Their head is an investment, their hair investment,

00:07:36.608 --> 00:07:40.679
nose investment, ears investment, everything is an investment!

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.883
What’s the use of becoming human beings?

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:45.948
You are just nothing but investments!

00:07:46.068 --> 00:07:48.638
Doesn’t matter if the house is little bit sold,

00:07:48.758 --> 00:07:52.289
you get little less price. What does it matter?

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:55.104
After all you have lived in that house.

00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:58.281
But I’ve seen that it’s very common

00:07:58.401 --> 00:08:01.936
that if a guest is sitting and the child spills something,

00:08:02.056 --> 00:08:05.795
immediately before the guest we’ll start cleaning it.

00:08:05.915 --> 00:08:08.486
It’s very bad manners.

00:08:09.422 --> 00:08:13.008
What is this carpet worth than a human being?

00:08:13.128 --> 00:08:17.173
So the Lakshmi principle is to understand

00:08:17.293 --> 00:08:23.483
that matter is for expression of your love.

00:08:25.094 --> 00:08:27.688
How much you do for others,

00:08:27.808 --> 00:08:30.751
how much comfort you can give to others.

00:08:30.871 --> 00:08:34.385
I’ve seen some people, I’ve been to some people

00:08:34.505 --> 00:08:39.019
that the Gruha Lakshmi, the woman who is in the house,

00:08:39.139 --> 00:08:41.875
won’t even look after the tea of the people, nothing!!!

00:08:41.995 --> 00:08:47.080
She’s just enjoying herself and bothering about the carpets

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:50.581
or I don’t know, about the soap, about this.

00:08:50.701 --> 00:08:52.032
I mean so low level it is,

00:08:52.152 --> 00:08:56.794
not even, it’s not even a humanistic thing!!!

00:08:58.674 --> 00:09:02.507
So, Lakshmi principle means love.

00:09:02.627 --> 00:09:04.832
This very few people understand.

00:09:04.952 --> 00:09:11.038
To them Lakshmi means money in the bank. No, doesn’t mean that.

00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:18.298
It means money or anything like that to express your love.

00:09:22.758 --> 00:09:28.343
The another symbolic thing about Her is She’s a mother.

00:09:29.326 --> 00:09:32.601
And mother just gives – nirvajya.

00:09:32.721 --> 00:09:37.094
She doesn’t charge any interest for what she gives. She just gives.

00:09:39.411 --> 00:09:42.201
Her enjoyment is giving.

00:09:43.573 --> 00:09:46.413
I mean I always think what should I cook for you?

00:09:46.533 --> 00:09:50.175
If I can do this, I can buy this, I can buy this present for you.

00:09:50.295 --> 00:09:52.353
I mean Diwali is a good day for Me

00:09:52.473 --> 00:09:56.403
that I can give you so many things that I want to give you.

00:09:56.523 --> 00:10:02.035
And I love it! Nothing like the joy of giving.

00:10:02.155 --> 00:10:05.465
If you have more things it’s a headache.

00:10:06.916 --> 00:10:09.824
It’s a headache. But you think that

00:10:09.944 --> 00:10:13.286
“I have to buy this thing now. What should I buy for…

00:10:13.406 --> 00:10:16.761
oh I have to give it to this one, this will fit that person alright.”

00:10:16.881 --> 00:10:21.290
So it relates to the collective feeling,

00:10:21.614 --> 00:10:23.811
a very beautiful feeling.

00:10:27.834 --> 00:10:29.758
So the Western people have to understand

00:10:29.878 --> 00:10:33.449
that materialism has gone too far into their heads.

00:10:36.092 --> 00:10:41.223
Everything to be insured, for what?

00:10:44.532 --> 00:10:46.439
But in India if we have such people,

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:49.685
I know one or two people are like that, in a,

00:10:49.805 --> 00:10:52.046
say, in a city, small city.

00:10:52.166 --> 00:10:54.345
Then if they see in the morning these people

00:10:54.465 --> 00:10:56.603
they’ll go and have a bath!

00:10:58.547 --> 00:11:01.250
Or if they are seeing somebody coming from that side,

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.439
of that kind, they’ll just go in the other way round.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.155
I asked, “Why is it Baba when that one who is coming…?”

00:11:07.275 --> 00:11:10.525
“Is a horrible materialistic fellow! Better go this way!”

00:11:10.645 --> 00:11:13.081
But here in the West what should you do?

00:11:13.201 --> 00:11:17.919
Everybody is like that! Where should you hide yourself?

00:11:22.077 --> 00:11:26.237
So we have to realize, in all introspection we have to realize,

00:11:26.357 --> 00:11:29.615
that we have gone too much into materialism.

00:11:32.042 --> 00:11:36.144
That doesn’t mean that you should not make money!

00:11:36.264 --> 00:11:38.109
That doesn’t mean you should not work,

00:11:38.229 --> 00:11:41.785
you should be lethargic, that you should say that

00:11:41.905 --> 00:11:45.352
“Oh, Mother has said. Now, let us be lotus eaters.'”

00:11:45.472 --> 00:11:47.944
Not that. Try to understand!

00:11:48.753 --> 00:11:52.764
If you are making money it is just to give.

00:11:56.129 --> 00:11:58.055
Then otherwise your situation will be bad,

00:11:58.175 --> 00:12:00.472
you’ll be always insecured about money.

00:12:00.592 --> 00:12:03.467
And those who have money instead of feeling secured

00:12:03.587 --> 00:12:07.034
they are the all day shaking like this, I have seen.

00:12:08.112 --> 00:12:09.650
So what is the use of having?

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:12.468
Is better not to have anything like that that shakes you.

00:12:12.589 --> 00:12:14.917
Better to settle down with a little hut somewhere

00:12:15.037 --> 00:12:17.271
and enjoy Sahaja Yoga!

00:12:21.795 --> 00:12:24.798
So Lakshmi tattwa is not money-oriented.

00:12:26.147 --> 00:12:30.764
Supposing you take a dog or take a donkey

00:12:31.176 --> 00:12:37.380
and put lots of notes on that, will you call him a lakshmipati?

00:12:41.078 --> 00:12:46.527
Or take another human being who has got ten cars to show off,

00:12:46.647 --> 00:12:48.898
who has got a swanky car,

00:12:49.754 --> 00:12:51.509
and who is nervous, twitchy.

00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:53.808
Will you call him a lakshmipati?

00:12:56.744 --> 00:13:04.973
There is no grace in this kind of money that people have.

00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:08.392
They are crazy, they have no traditions,

00:13:08.512 --> 00:13:12.237
they have no sweetness, nothing in them.

00:13:12.357 --> 00:13:17.068
They are dry, as if the whole juice has been

00:13:17.188 --> 00:13:20.810
taken out of the sugar cane, they are like that.

00:13:21.405 --> 00:13:24.107
And nobody wants to go to such houses.

00:13:24.227 --> 00:13:29.756
But to be very frank in such houses if I eat, I get vomiting.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.059
My Lakshmi doesn’t like it.

00:13:36.758 --> 00:13:39.553
So you should feel obliged that you can give to others.

00:13:39.673 --> 00:13:42.421
You should feel obliged that you can do for others.

00:13:42.541 --> 00:13:45.416
This is the first sign of a Sahaja yogi.

00:13:49.903 --> 00:13:52.759
I shouldn’t say but, what I’ve heard from many people

00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:56.389
that people don’t like to spend any money for Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:58.476
They’ll spend for anything else.

00:13:58.596 --> 00:14:01.623
They’ll take some, what you call, the face,

00:14:01.743 --> 00:14:04.341
what you call them? Cosmetics.

00:14:04.896 --> 00:14:08.257
Or men may buy something expensive, watches, some things.

00:14:08.377 --> 00:14:10.839
But for Sahaja Yoga they don’t want to spend.

00:14:10.959 --> 00:14:14.803
Now you have to know that Sahaja Yoga is

00:14:14.923 --> 00:14:18.220
for the emancipation of the whole world.

00:14:22.425 --> 00:14:26.537
What is this cosmetic going to do for the whole world?

00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:29.614
Or your watch, what is it going to do?

00:14:33.337 --> 00:14:38.233
Or the way you dress up or the way you try to show off,

00:14:38.621 --> 00:14:40.251
is it going to help the world?

00:14:40.371 --> 00:14:45.621
You are here to help the world and not to decorate yourself

00:14:46.534 --> 00:14:50.697
and just to make advantage of Sahaja Yoga!

00:14:51.704 --> 00:14:56.038
So it’s very blissful. Sahaja Yoga is extremely blissful.

00:14:56.158 --> 00:14:59.010
It gives you first the glimpse of Lakshmi

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:03.376
that it gives you money. You are blessed.

00:15:04.788 --> 00:15:09.973
And then that is the first temptation

00:15:14.957 --> 00:15:18.802
and you fall a prey, and you go down.

00:15:23.841 --> 00:15:30.104
So this Lakshmi principle is to be understood in its proper way.

00:15:30.224 --> 00:15:32.115
For Sahaja yogis is very important

00:15:32.235 --> 00:15:35.631
because it is not so superficial as we think.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:42.437
It is much deeper within us and when we touch our depth,

00:15:42.557 --> 00:15:44.472
it shows.

00:15:48.672 --> 00:15:53.043
Then there are two other symbols we see.

00:15:53.163 --> 00:15:57.123
With left hand She gives.

00:16:00.272 --> 00:16:03.744
I’ve given this simile many a times that, if you open one door

00:16:03.864 --> 00:16:04.974
the air won’t come in.

00:16:05.094 --> 00:16:07.364
You have to open the other one so it circulates.

00:16:07.484 --> 00:16:09.079
She must give.

00:16:10.848 --> 00:16:16.249
So all those who have Lakshmi tattwa developed in them,

00:16:16.369 --> 00:16:18.626
they think what to give.

00:16:19.895 --> 00:16:23.225
But they don’t give the worst thing that they have.

00:16:23.345 --> 00:16:26.197
Just like a waste paper basket is a friend,

00:16:26.317 --> 00:16:28.475
“Ah! This is useless. I better,

00:16:28.595 --> 00:16:31.464
instead of throwing, I can give it to that friend.”

00:16:31.584 --> 00:16:33.355
And then friend says, “All right.

00:16:33.475 --> 00:16:36.548
It’s very nice. I’ll give it to another friend.”

00:16:37.636 --> 00:16:41.236
And all friends are used as waste paper baskets.

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.256
Whatever is the worst is given.

00:16:47.382 --> 00:16:49.768
How can you touch your depth?

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.154
Whatever is the best if you can give,

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.928
if you are free to give, you should give the best.

00:17:05.467 --> 00:17:08.334
So, one of the snags is that

00:17:08.454 --> 00:17:11.537
we have never learnt the art of giving.

00:17:12.029 --> 00:17:16.623
If we learn the art of giving then it’s so joyous, so beautiful.

00:17:21.337 --> 00:17:24.288
Because we are very ego-oriented,

00:17:25.288 --> 00:17:27.285
we understand what gives us joy

00:17:27.405 --> 00:17:30.161
but we don’t understand what will give joy to others.

00:17:30.281 --> 00:17:34.301
And when we understand what will give joy to others,

00:17:34.421 --> 00:17:39.939
then that joy reflects on us much more, thousand times.

00:17:45.003 --> 00:17:47.918
But there is then, as I said,

00:17:48.038 --> 00:17:50.572
that on the periphery both things work out.

00:17:50.692 --> 00:17:53.177
From one side are the miserly,

00:17:53.297 --> 00:17:56.736
from the other side are the exploiters.

00:17:58.387 --> 00:18:02.682
So if you become generous, the exploiters are there.

00:18:04.975 --> 00:18:09.885
So then an antithesis, another type of people become,

00:18:10.005 --> 00:18:13.842
who get nervous, who don’t know what to do, where to go.

00:18:15.373 --> 00:18:21.927
In Sahaja Yoga you do trust people, all the time.

00:18:22.047 --> 00:18:26.806
You give. Of course sometimes you are exploited.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.437
So doesn’t matter, that’s not your look out.

00:18:29.558 --> 00:18:31.096
You have not committed any sin.

00:18:31.272 --> 00:18:33.999
The one who has exploited you, he has committed the sin

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.639
and he is going to suffer, so why should you worry?

00:18:40.473 --> 00:18:44.019
But with the help of this divine power,

00:18:44.979 --> 00:18:48.094
the one who exploits will suffer.

00:18:49.887 --> 00:18:54.305
And you will get ten times more than what you have lost.

00:18:54.425 --> 00:18:57.562
This is what it is to be understood by Sahaja yogis.

00:18:57.682 --> 00:19:02.060
That we are now blessed by this divine power.

00:19:02.409 --> 00:19:07.310
We are not alone. All the time it is blessing us.

00:19:12.691 --> 00:19:16.329
So giving means nothing is mine.

00:19:16.449 --> 00:19:19.238
“My, my, my, my,” has to be given up.

00:19:21.349 --> 00:19:24.511
Even in Sahaja Yoga I was surprised

00:19:24.631 --> 00:19:27.612
that people in the West who were not attached to their children

00:19:27.732 --> 00:19:30.486
get very much attached to their children.

00:19:30.708 --> 00:19:34.824
And they just think about their children and nothing else.

00:19:35.531 --> 00:19:41.931
This is another kind of selfishness.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:47.720
If you just think of your own children only and nobody else,

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.580
then the same children will become devils

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.171
and teach you a lesson.

00:19:54.291 --> 00:19:58.056
And you’ll say, “Next time, oh God, don’t give me any children,

00:19:58.176 --> 00:20:04.991
had enough!” But if you make the child collective

00:20:05.879 --> 00:20:09.782
and teach child to give others and to enjoy that,

00:20:09.902 --> 00:20:12.572
then from the very childhood the child becomes

00:20:12.692 --> 00:20:15.997
extremely generous.

00:20:19.496 --> 00:20:22.998
I mean generosity is the quality,

00:20:24.021 --> 00:20:27.795
is of an incarnation – aishwarya.

00:20:28.008 --> 00:20:32.337
Aishwarya doesn’t mean only the money, the wealth,

00:20:32.457 --> 00:20:41.106
but generosity excels the money.

00:20:41.578 --> 00:20:44.405
That is aishwarya, and that is the sign

00:20:44.525 --> 00:20:48.157
of an incarnation and sign of a Sahaja yogi.

00:20:53.649 --> 00:20:56.491
The another hand is like this.

00:20:57.644 --> 00:21:01.464
That means She gives you protection.

00:21:03.702 --> 00:21:06.802
If you don’t feel protected with money, throw it away.

00:21:06.922 --> 00:21:09.967
Just run away from it. Headache.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.314
But also She gives protection to others.

00:21:15.434 --> 00:21:18.786
A person who has Lakshmi, he has family,

00:21:18.906 --> 00:21:23.132
he has children, he has everyone.

00:21:25.123 --> 00:21:27.381
The worst thing I’ve seen [is]

00:21:27.501 --> 00:21:28.523
that in the West

00:21:28.643 --> 00:21:32.632
the parents don’t give any money to their children

00:21:32.752 --> 00:21:36.413
when they grow up. Then don’t look after them

00:21:36.533 --> 00:21:38.779
but they are so possessive!

00:21:40.048 --> 00:21:42.841
On the contrary, in India

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:47.407
we give all our lives to our children and we are least possessive.

00:21:47.527 --> 00:21:50.498
And they are even possessive of the grandchildren.

00:21:50.618 --> 00:21:53.709
That’s why the families are like this here.

00:21:53.867 --> 00:21:59.482
So the whole system has gone in a funny way, chaotic.

00:21:59.602 --> 00:22:02.874
So it is important for Sahaja yogis to understand

00:22:02.994 --> 00:22:08.920
that they will first of all look after their children,

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.177
give them whatever they need, nourish them,

00:22:11.297 --> 00:22:14.594
give them guidance, don’t spoil them.

00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:21.274
And, secondly, once they are married and have children

00:22:21.394 --> 00:22:23.198
they will not try to possess them

00:22:23.318 --> 00:22:27.020
and possess their children, their wives.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.147
And this protection that is given

00:22:33.267 --> 00:22:35.973
is the protection of a mother.

00:22:37.124 --> 00:22:39.413
Say you are working in an office,

00:22:39.533 --> 00:22:42.139
you’re working in a hospital,

00:22:42.259 --> 00:22:45.817
you’re working in a factory, anywhere you are working,

00:22:45.937 --> 00:22:48.641
all other people who are working under you

00:22:48.761 --> 00:22:51.618
are your children, are to be treated like that

00:22:51.738 --> 00:22:53.502
and they are to feel like that.

00:22:53.622 --> 00:22:57.108
They have to feel it’s a family. Try this!

00:22:58.069 --> 00:23:00.754
My husband, I told him that,

00:23:00.874 --> 00:23:04.123
“You treat your office as your family.”

00:23:04.677 --> 00:23:07.332
So early in the morning they used to arrive from Calcutta,

00:23:07.452 --> 00:23:10.979
about say five o’clock, by plane.

00:23:11.099 --> 00:23:15.006
And I would Myself cook their breakfast and give it to them.

00:23:15.126 --> 00:23:18.086
They were just ordinary clerks.

00:23:20.458 --> 00:23:24.201
Because this is how through the protection,

00:23:24.321 --> 00:23:27.268
through the care, through the love

00:23:27.998 --> 00:23:31.208
you can make them so dynamic

00:23:31.328 --> 00:23:33.774
and that is how the Lakshmi tattwa will increase.

00:23:33.894 --> 00:23:36.856
Otherwise there will be strikes, there will be fights.

00:23:36.976 --> 00:23:39.448
This is the enlightenment!

00:23:43.591 --> 00:23:46.139
That’s why a person who thinks he is capitalistic

00:23:46.259 --> 00:23:50.044
must understand that the capital is worth nothing

00:23:50.164 --> 00:23:53.685
if you don’t know how to use your Lakshmi principle.

00:23:54.264 --> 00:23:57.195
That’s why they end up in jail, they end up in lunatic asylums

00:23:57.315 --> 00:24:01.016
or they become smugglers or something happens to them.

00:24:01.136 --> 00:24:06.148
They just go off. They are never respectable.

00:24:06.268 --> 00:24:09.564
And I haven’t seen any statue of a man

00:24:09.684 --> 00:24:13.340
who has been garlanded for being rich!

00:24:18.344 --> 00:24:22.810
So if you are rich, nobody is going to respect you.

00:24:23.636 --> 00:24:30.800
But for generosity, something substantial, what you have done.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:37.569
Something substantial – for others, for the society,

00:24:38.886 --> 00:24:41.380
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:43.338 --> 00:24:45.975
We are working out now ashrams

00:24:46.095 --> 00:24:49.392
and projects and things and all that

00:24:49.741 --> 00:24:51.960
but when it comes to money, Sahaja yogis think,

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.090
“Oh no, that’s not my job. Only I can send my child there.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:57.887
Mother must look after all the children,

00:24:58.007 --> 00:25:00.531
Mother must do this, Mother must find out this,

00:25:00.651 --> 00:25:03.843
She must provide for this.” Everything She should do

00:25:03.963 --> 00:25:05.304
and what about me?

00:25:05.424 --> 00:25:11.018
I’ll just put money in the banks, Swiss banks specially.”

00:25:14.434 --> 00:25:20.003
So one has to decide, “How much of my money I am giving

00:25:20.123 --> 00:25:23.333
for the work of Sahaja Yoga?” I don’t want your money.

00:25:23.453 --> 00:25:25.811
No money is to be given for Sahaja Yoga, in the sense,

00:25:25.931 --> 00:25:29.124
for your realization. But if you have to have a hall,

00:25:29.244 --> 00:25:30.722
if you have to have a program,

00:25:30.842 --> 00:25:32.208
if you have to have an ashram,

00:25:32.328 --> 00:25:34.115
anything is to be done, you need money.

00:25:34.235 --> 00:25:37.030
And for that anybody asks, “All right give one pound each”

00:25:37.150 --> 00:25:40.613
They won’t give. “No, why should I give one pound?”

00:25:45.177 --> 00:25:49.471
And there’s a national competition in that,

00:25:49.591 --> 00:25:51.554
national competition.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.826
It shows that still you have not touched your depth.

00:25:58.946 --> 00:26:02.424
If you touch your depth, you’ll give

00:26:02.544 --> 00:26:06.792
and you’ll enjoy your giving. You must touch your depths.

00:26:06.912 --> 00:26:10.771
So the enlightenment is yet not complete.

00:26:10.891 --> 00:26:13.941
Now, I’m saying it to you all individually,

00:26:14.061 --> 00:26:17.834
you introspect yourself and see for yourself.

00:26:21.234 --> 00:26:23.270
Let us see, count how much money

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:27.773
have I given for Sahaja Yoga work,

00:26:27.893 --> 00:26:32.427
all of us, individually.

00:26:34.332 --> 00:26:36.287
Now, you will give Me present,

00:26:36.407 --> 00:26:38.644
because you think that gives you blessings.

00:26:38.764 --> 00:26:40.789
That’s not the point. Point is –

00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:46.531
“How much money I have kept for Sahaja Yoga out of my income?”

00:26:51.277 --> 00:26:55.051
This is the first question of Lakshmi principle.

00:26:57.646 --> 00:27:00.268
Now, how the Mahalakshmi tattwa comes in?

00:27:00.388 --> 00:27:05.693
First the Lakshmi. Lakshmi is born out of the sea.

00:27:06.359 --> 00:27:10.151
Now, why She was born out of the sea?

00:27:15.425 --> 00:27:19.504
She was born out of the sea because Her father

00:27:19.624 --> 00:27:25.174
is a generous personality. Look at the sea.

00:27:26.119 --> 00:27:29.879
It spreads its wings all over,

00:27:29.999 --> 00:27:36.354
gets itself heated up completely so that clouds are made.

00:27:37.282 --> 00:27:45.789
And these clouds go and bang at those high mountains

00:27:46.225 --> 00:27:47.969
where it rains.

00:27:48.089 --> 00:27:53.028
They form the rivers and then they come back to the sea.

00:27:53.148 --> 00:27:55.421
But all this, while the sea contains

00:27:55.541 --> 00:28:01.547
all the salt within itself, all the salt is within itself.

00:28:02.102 --> 00:28:08.046
And then it gives salt. Christ has said, “You are the salt.”

00:28:08.166 --> 00:28:14.091
What is the salt? Salt, which gives the taste to food,

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.244
is your Guru principle.

00:28:18.364 --> 00:28:21.935
You cannot become a Guru, you cannot become a leader,

00:28:22.055 --> 00:28:23.978
if you are a miserly person. You cannot.

00:28:24.098 --> 00:28:27.004
How horrible even it looks, just imagine!

00:28:30.036 --> 00:28:33.464
So She is born out of the Guru principle.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:41.303
And this Guru principle starts working in you,

00:28:41.423 --> 00:28:45.912
when you have this Lakshmi principle awakened.

00:28:46.032 --> 00:28:50.543
Not money, I’m not saying money. Is the Lakshmi principle

00:28:51.312 --> 00:28:52.910
when you start thinking,

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:57.581
“What sweet thing I should give to another?”

00:29:01.619 --> 00:29:05.768
When you start thinking, “What should I do for others?”

00:29:08.062 --> 00:29:17.667
You have to be extremely sweet, soft, not dry, not dry people.

00:29:21.072 --> 00:29:24.763
“How to express my love?”

00:29:26.533 --> 00:29:30.673
So first thing is, as the sea spreads its wings

00:29:30.793 --> 00:29:35.977
and says, “All right, let the sun take away my water,

00:29:36.097 --> 00:29:42.292
let me boil, let it become the clouds.”

00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:49.550
In the same way you people have to understand

00:29:50.764 --> 00:29:57.626
that unless and until I allow the Sun, that’s the Spirit,

00:29:58.851 --> 00:30:03.900
to evaporate this water from me, means to give to others,

00:30:06.193 --> 00:30:10.157
how will I develop this guru principle within myself?

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:13.469
You cannot have salt in the seawater

00:30:13.589 --> 00:30:16.044
unless and until you evaporate it.

00:30:17.901 --> 00:30:21.432
So you cannot become a guru unless and until you allow

00:30:21.552 --> 00:30:24.834
the evaporation of this water,

00:30:24.954 --> 00:30:27.603
of this wealth, the money that you have.

00:30:34.292 --> 00:30:42.664
But if you are not matured enough, like the sea,

00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:50.194
then you will remain at a level that, like mad,

00:30:53.527 --> 00:30:56.616
collecting all the muck of the world

00:30:56.736 --> 00:31:00.692
and ultimately end up in some lunatic asylum.

00:31:02.564 --> 00:31:05.928
Because all maryadas are lost, all dharma is lost.

00:31:06.048 --> 00:31:09.352
Without guru principle, how you can have dharma?

00:31:10.248 --> 00:31:11.956
You do not think of anybody else,

00:31:12.076 --> 00:31:14.667
you do not even think of your father, mother or anyone,

00:31:14.787 --> 00:31:16.784
you don’t think of your collective work,

00:31:16.905 --> 00:31:20.226
you don’t think of the world. That’s too much.

00:31:21.385 --> 00:31:25.026
So you become small, small, small, small, small.

00:31:28.557 --> 00:31:31.796
But when this Lakshmi tattwa starts,

00:31:31.916 --> 00:31:38.408
that’s the first inkling of love, love for others.

00:31:40.278 --> 00:31:42.880
I know you all love Me very much.

00:31:43.944 --> 00:31:47.656
But it’s not complete reflection of your Mother.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:51.540
You have to love each other

00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:56.980
and share everything with each other, with love.

00:32:02.011 --> 00:32:09.104
Then this first light of love, Lakshmi, starts showing in you.

00:32:10.341 --> 00:32:18.431
In that light when you move, you become very deeply generous,

00:32:19.439 --> 00:32:21.660
enjoy your generosity.

00:32:23.993 --> 00:32:25.727
But I’ve seen

00:32:26.273 --> 00:32:28.888
before Sahaja Yoga people don’t care for their children,

00:32:29.008 --> 00:32:32.619
don’t care for their wives, don’t care for anything.

00:32:32.739 --> 00:32:36.827
Either they go to the pubs or they have other women kept

00:32:36.947 --> 00:32:41.818
or something like that. But after Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:41.938 --> 00:32:45.425
like a pendulum, they move to the other extreme.

00:32:46.535 --> 00:32:49.668
Then their wife is the most important.

00:32:49.788 --> 00:32:52.948
Even if she’s a bhoot, anything, she’s the most important thing.

00:32:53.068 --> 00:33:00.532
Then the children. Like hawks, they grab their children,

00:33:00.652 --> 00:33:04.959
their wife, their house, their things.

00:33:05.079 --> 00:33:07.148
To them then becomes, “This is the main duty.

00:33:07.268 --> 00:33:10.382
Mother has said we should have good families.”

00:33:10.644 --> 00:33:14.830
But I didn’t say that you become slaves of your families.

00:33:15.973 --> 00:33:18.913
I don’t say you break your families,

00:33:19.033 --> 00:33:23.871
but don’t crush them with your narrowness.

00:33:23.991 --> 00:33:28.645
Let them grow, let them open out.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.504
So from one extreme to another extreme you move.

00:33:36.694 --> 00:33:38.951
You have to come in the center.

00:33:41.149 --> 00:33:45.774
So this love has to start showing itself,

00:33:45.894 --> 00:33:49.348
manifesting itself in all humility.

00:33:49.468 --> 00:33:53.227
You are doing it for yourself, you are not doing it for others.

00:33:53.347 --> 00:33:56.319
If I’m trying to help somebody with money,

00:33:56.439 --> 00:33:58.432
I’m trying to help Myself

00:33:58.552 --> 00:34:01.952
because I can’t bear that person in trouble,

00:34:02.832 --> 00:34:04.582
so, no obligation.

00:34:08.391 --> 00:34:10.260
And I do it secretly.

00:34:11.022 --> 00:34:12.854
I don’t want to talk about it

00:34:12.974 --> 00:34:17.673
because I’m enjoying it secretly, I’m enjoying Myself.

00:34:17.793 --> 00:34:23.640
I’m not enjoying the idea that I’m doing this for others

00:34:27.544 --> 00:34:29.176
but just for Myself.

00:34:36.517 --> 00:34:40.939
So the ego part that is within us,

00:34:42.121 --> 00:34:46.465
which is more bloated with money.

00:34:48.663 --> 00:34:51.549
I mean, you can take out a man who has money.

00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:58.905
They’ll stand off from others. They’re different, you know.

00:34:59.595 --> 00:35:02.348
Then you think, “Is he coming from lunatic asylum?”

00:35:02.468 --> 00:35:05.082
“No, no, no, no, he is very rich.”

00:35:05.605 --> 00:35:07.980
They look as if they are from lunatic asylum,

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:11.874
but they are “No, no, no! They are rich, rich people, very rich!”

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.947
They stand in a wing, angular way,

00:35:15.067 --> 00:35:20.350
look at others in an angular way, very stupid people.

00:35:24.698 --> 00:35:27.145
So this is what we have to understand,

00:35:27.265 --> 00:35:29.546
that we have come out of one kind of nonsense,

00:35:29.666 --> 00:35:32.079
we should not jump into another.

00:35:35.348 --> 00:35:39.769
And we should see that we are here for Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:39.889 --> 00:35:42.470
We are specially chosen for Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:45.197
We have to work out Sahaja Yoga and nothing else.

00:35:45.317 --> 00:35:47.637
All our family, all our household,

00:35:47.757 --> 00:35:51.354
everything, everything is nothing but Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:51.474 --> 00:35:56.905
because we are dedicated, that we are deeply into it.

00:35:59.174 --> 00:36:02.095
So all these questions I find – women dominating men,

00:36:02.215 --> 00:36:05.265
men dominating women – will all disappear

00:36:05.385 --> 00:36:06.833
the moment you decide

00:36:06.953 --> 00:36:10.157
that we have to awaken Mahalakshmi principle within us.

00:36:10.277 --> 00:36:13.368
And the Mahalakshmi principle is the principle

00:36:13.488 --> 00:36:17.597
where you start seeking the truth and nothing else.

00:36:18.437 --> 00:36:25.587
But how can you seek the truth without any light in your hand?

00:36:29.364 --> 00:36:35.318
It’s not some sort of an abstract thing or just a drama.

00:36:35.438 --> 00:36:39.744
“Oh, I’m seeking the truth with my eyes closed

00:36:40.822 --> 00:36:44.671
and with darkness in my hand, I’m seeking the truth!”

00:36:46.479 --> 00:36:49.805
How can you take to Mahalakshmi principle

00:36:49.925 --> 00:36:53.450
unless and until the Lakshmi principle is embedded in you?

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:57.033
Unless and until you feel that love for each other,

00:36:57.153 --> 00:36:59.743
you have felt that love, you have expressed that love,

00:36:59.863 --> 00:37:01.553
you have been generous,

00:37:01.673 --> 00:37:04.995
you have been enjoying the generosity of your own.

00:37:05.115 --> 00:37:09.602
Then only you can rise up to that principle of Mahalakshmi

00:37:11.213 --> 00:37:13.734
which is the spiritual principle.

00:37:18.892 --> 00:37:23.362
And this spiritual principle has been established within us

00:37:23.482 --> 00:37:29.162
by penances of all the deities, if you see.

00:37:31.161 --> 00:37:33.014
See, look at Sita.

00:37:34.386 --> 00:37:38.885
She was born a daughter of a great king,

00:37:39.005 --> 00:37:43.620
married in a family who was so rich.

00:37:44.604 --> 00:37:50.055
And She had to go in the jungles without even shoes

00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:54.275
and She had to starve Herself for our sake.

00:37:57.069 --> 00:38:01.150
And then with all these She suffered,

00:38:03.166 --> 00:38:06.203
without any comfort She lived

00:38:06.323 --> 00:38:10.548
and then was attacked by this horrible Ravana.

00:38:11.503 --> 00:38:16.366
She lived with him and kept Her chastity and purity

00:38:16.801 --> 00:38:20.316
and then She came out of that ordeal

00:38:20.436 --> 00:38:24.794
and She created this Mahalakshmi principle to begin with.

00:38:26.937 --> 00:38:28.761
Why did She do it?

00:38:32.054 --> 00:38:35.131
She should have succumbed to this Ravana and should have enjoyed.

00:38:35.251 --> 00:38:37.941
I mean, normally people would do that.

00:38:38.814 --> 00:38:41.643
Why did She suffer so much?

00:38:42.222 --> 00:38:49.556
Because She had a nobler life to lead to, for our sake.

00:38:50.175 --> 00:38:53.894
She had to do that ordeal for our sake.

00:38:56.250 --> 00:38:57.949
And She did it.

00:39:00.369 --> 00:39:03.608
So She was the first incarnation,

00:39:03.728 --> 00:39:06.884
we can say, of Mahalakshmi principle.

00:39:08.606 --> 00:39:15.510
You see Her background and from where to what She went.

00:39:18.493 --> 00:39:23.703
Sakshat Mahalakshmi had to go through all these things

00:39:23.823 --> 00:39:27.254
to show us that if you want

00:39:27.374 --> 00:39:30.217
to have the Mahalakshmi principle within you

00:39:30.337 --> 00:39:33.336
then what sort of a woman you should be.

00:39:36.566 --> 00:39:40.349
That’s the first we have seen Her in anything.

00:39:40.469 --> 00:39:45.845
Then who came afterwards than Her, is Radha.

00:39:47.901 --> 00:39:50.399
Radha came, Ra-dha. ‘Ra’ is energy,

00:39:50.519 --> 00:39:53.808
‘dha’ is the one who has sustained, is Radha.

00:39:57.292 --> 00:39:59.456
If you see Her life,

00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:07.479
all Her life She worked out our Kundalini – Raasa.

00:40:11.407 --> 00:40:20.811
Full of sweetness, full of beautiful generosity,

00:40:21.814 --> 00:40:25.125
She danced and danced and danced.

00:40:25.529 --> 00:40:32.420
Her feet used to pain when Shri Krishna used to rub them.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.328
And She didn’t go with Shri Krishna.

00:40:36.448 --> 00:40:40.517
When He became the king She said, “You go, that’s all right.

00:40:40.637 --> 00:40:42.112
I’m not [going].

00:40:42.232 --> 00:40:45.714
I have to still work out Mahalakshmi principle

00:40:45.834 --> 00:40:48.131
among the gopas and gopis.”

00:40:48.693 --> 00:40:52.017
She stayed back in a small place.

00:40:53.024 --> 00:40:57.157
But how much surrendered She was to Shri Krishna,

00:41:00.059 --> 00:41:04.770
how much surrendered She was to the work of Virata.

00:41:06.001 --> 00:41:09.973
That She knew, “I have to work out the Virata’s work.”

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:13.090
And She stayed back.

00:41:13.210 --> 00:41:17.039
There are so many beautiful stories about Her.

00:41:18.729 --> 00:41:27.374
So this second penance of the Mahalakshmi we know in Radha.

00:41:31.142 --> 00:41:35.781
Then the third one came as the Mother of Christ.

00:41:37.367 --> 00:41:41.967
She gave Her child to be crucified.

00:41:43.586 --> 00:41:48.537
Will we just introspect ourselves!

00:41:48.657 --> 00:41:52.625
How much we are attached like hawks on our children.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:59.194
If anybody says anything to the children, people don’t like it.

00:42:00.233 --> 00:42:03.292
I’ve got reports from Switzerland

00:42:03.412 --> 00:42:05.408
that if anybody says anything to the children,

00:42:05.528 --> 00:42:08.790
the parents don’t like it. No.

00:42:14.163 --> 00:42:17.747
Nobody should say anything to their children.

00:42:20.845 --> 00:42:23.925
Here She gives Her child

00:42:24.045 --> 00:42:30.066
to be crucified for the emancipation of humanity.

00:42:32.653 --> 00:42:35.731
I can’t even look at the cross.

00:42:40.715 --> 00:42:44.568
While we are so much attached to our children,

00:42:45.346 --> 00:42:51.320
what are we teaching them? Are we teaching them any sacrifices?

00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:54.070
Are we teaching them any sharing?

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:57.415
Are we teaching them any tolerance?

00:42:57.535 --> 00:43:01.158
Are we teaching them forgiveness?

00:43:03.451 --> 00:43:06.377
On the contrary, if anybody says anything to the child

00:43:06.497 --> 00:43:10.745
we don’t like it, leave alone crucifixion,

00:43:10.865 --> 00:43:13.661
leave alone even little punishment.

00:43:13.781 --> 00:43:18.858
The child has now become the biggest ordeal for Sahaja yogis.

00:43:18.978 --> 00:43:22.164
I can tell you, I can see it so clearly.

00:43:22.417 --> 00:43:26.587
The attachment to children is so great in the West

00:43:26.707 --> 00:43:29.377
that I am surprised.

00:43:30.194 --> 00:43:34.261
Everybody gets children, what’s so great about it?

00:43:34.381 --> 00:43:36.999
The greatness is what kind of children you are.

00:43:37.119 --> 00:43:38.739
Tomorrow these children ……

00:43:38.859 --> 00:43:42.149
Please move the child that side. Don’t do that. Get out!

00:43:42.269 --> 00:43:44.623
Please get out and don’t do that in the lectures.

00:43:44.743 --> 00:43:48.119
I don’t like women standing here and moving their carts

00:43:48.239 --> 00:43:52.377
and this… Show some respect! Can you do that in a church?

00:43:55.527 --> 00:43:58.740
You see sometimes I do not understand

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:02.249
that a certain protocol also women don’t understand.

00:44:02.369 --> 00:44:03.461
Please take child out

00:44:03.581 --> 00:44:08.147
and don’t keep the thing here, go out! Please tell her.

00:44:12.281 --> 00:44:15.950
You don’t take your perambulators in the churches do you,

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:19.089
where there is no Adi Shakti sitting?

00:44:22.172 --> 00:44:26.777
Because the principle is mainly your own child,

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:30.726
it’s grabbing you, I tell you, it’s grabbing you.

00:44:30.846 --> 00:44:34.627
Your children are grabbing you and you are grabbing them.

00:44:34.747 --> 00:44:37.385
So we must understand.

00:44:37.505 --> 00:44:41.358
Are we allowing our children to grow big?

00:44:41.659 --> 00:44:46.308
Are they generous? Are they saints?

00:44:48.284 --> 00:44:50.494
Are they beautiful?

00:44:52.052 --> 00:44:55.562
How do they talk to others? Are they confident?

00:44:55.682 --> 00:44:59.759
Tomorrow they are going to be the leaders of Sahaja yogis.

00:45:02.878 --> 00:45:05.845
Like Shivaji’s mother, like Jijamata,

00:45:06.956 --> 00:45:09.935
how she made the son great!

00:45:10.055 --> 00:45:13.343
It’s the mother who makes the children great,

00:45:13.463 --> 00:45:20.318
and if she wants all the time to sort of a, grab the child

00:45:20.438 --> 00:45:25.302
and the child to grab the mother, then it is suicidal,

00:45:25.422 --> 00:45:29.123
suicidal for you and suicidal for the children.

00:45:31.933 --> 00:45:35.230
What have we done about our children?

00:45:38.316 --> 00:45:42.837
Is duty of every Sahaja yogi to see that their children grow,

00:45:42.957 --> 00:45:48.105
grow as great people, greater than you.

00:45:49.053 --> 00:45:51.883
They have to look after the world.

00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:58.327
If you spend time with your children, see that

00:45:58.447 --> 00:46:00.761
you mould them, you nourish them with love

00:46:00.881 --> 00:46:04.361
and tell them that they should give love to others.

00:46:05.019 --> 00:46:07.935
That they should behave in such a manner

00:46:08.055 --> 00:46:12.099
that everybody should feel that love through them.

00:46:12.804 --> 00:46:20.794
Otherwise they will become devils like Ravana.

00:46:20.914 --> 00:46:23.872
Ravana was a realized soul and spoilt by his mother,

00:46:23.992 --> 00:46:25.994
became a devil.

00:46:29.668 --> 00:46:31.897
If you don’t want your children to be devils,

00:46:32.017 --> 00:46:34.516
first of all understand that they are not your children,

00:46:34.636 --> 00:46:38.529
they are My children, under your trust.

00:46:38.869 --> 00:46:43.746
And you are not to make your children dwarfish and smalls.

00:46:46.936 --> 00:46:51.020
This is a new temptation I find in Sahaja Yoga

00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:54.474
people are developing, so be careful.

00:46:54.594 --> 00:46:56.645
I wanted to warn you

00:46:56.765 --> 00:46:59.623
because we have to make our children like lights.

00:46:59.743 --> 00:47:04.271
Light burns for others, not for itself.

00:47:05.842 --> 00:47:08.798
We talk of lights, Diwali, all right, but

00:47:08.918 --> 00:47:13.153
these lights are burning for others every moment.

00:47:13.273 --> 00:47:17.190
Do we learn from them? Are we burning for others?

00:47:17.310 --> 00:47:20.432
Are our children going to burn for the others?

00:47:20.552 --> 00:47:23.920
You are making them so selfish.

00:47:26.871 --> 00:47:30.282
So thousands and thousands of children are going to come.

00:47:30.402 --> 00:47:35.074
And even when they are born realized, I’ve seen you spoil them.

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:39.220
I mean, if you take a diamond and put it in a gutter

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:42.342
it will be lost. It’s like that.

00:47:42.937 --> 00:47:45.473
Even if you have the best children, you can ruin them

00:47:45.593 --> 00:47:47.619
by this kind of stupid idea that,

00:47:47.739 --> 00:47:51.247
“That’s my child, this is mine.”

00:47:53.079 --> 00:47:56.442
Expose your children to good things.

00:47:56.562 --> 00:48:00.632
Tell them what is good. Tell them how to be good to others,

00:48:00.752 --> 00:48:02.053
tell them to look after them,

00:48:02.173 --> 00:48:04.564
tell them how to press the feet of others,

00:48:04.684 --> 00:48:08.568
how to comb the hair, how to give food to others.

00:48:08.688 --> 00:48:15.461
Teach them! Let them carry little trays and feed others,

00:48:15.581 --> 00:48:20.837
to the birds, let them give water to the flowers.

00:48:22.201 --> 00:48:26.301
Don’t make them small.

00:48:26.421 --> 00:48:28.926
Some of the children are really dynamic,

00:48:29.046 --> 00:48:32.263
great saints born to you, but you are ruining them

00:48:32.383 --> 00:48:34.192
and I have to warn you about it that,

00:48:34.312 --> 00:48:37.505
in Mahalakshmi tattwa, if you have to now give it to them,

00:48:37.625 --> 00:48:42.526
please remember that all these great incarnations of Mahalakshmi

00:48:42.646 --> 00:48:44.378
had to go through such ordeal.

00:48:44.498 --> 00:48:47.159
So what is the incarnation of Mary teaches us?

00:48:47.279 --> 00:48:49.431
Many people say, “Oh what was Mary? After all,

00:48:49.551 --> 00:48:53.039
She was just nothing.” Look at the incarnation of Mary.

00:48:53.159 --> 00:49:02.845
What does She teach us? You are supposed to be Christians.

00:49:02.965 --> 00:49:06.894
You are supposed to be Hindus. Supposed.

00:49:07.014 --> 00:49:11.373
But what do they teach us these Mahalakshmi principles?

00:49:11.992 --> 00:49:18.117
The last Mahalakshmi principle came as Fatima.

00:49:19.632 --> 00:49:24.305
Fatima, the Gruha Lakshmi, She stayed at home.

00:49:24.425 --> 00:49:29.017
She didn’t show off. She was not the one who went out.

00:49:29.137 --> 00:49:31.566
She stayed at home, looked after household,

00:49:31.686 --> 00:49:35.818
looked after their children and made them two great warriors.

00:49:35.938 --> 00:49:39.164
Her children and Her husband, they fought for the right,

00:49:39.284 --> 00:49:41.858
they fought for the truth.

00:49:47.255 --> 00:49:49.081
She was a Gruha Lakshmi.

00:49:49.201 --> 00:49:53.639
I’ve seen, I’m sometimes very much amazed also,

00:49:53.759 --> 00:49:58.295
that if you see the television, [when] a child is lost

00:49:58.415 --> 00:50:01.045
is the mother who speaks, the father does not.

00:50:01.165 --> 00:50:04.104
He seems more shocked than the mother.

00:50:05.015 --> 00:50:06.851
Mother is trying to show off

00:50:06.971 --> 00:50:09.414
because she thinks in the television she will be seen.

00:50:09.534 --> 00:50:11.826
She’s forgotten her pain, she’s forgotten everything.

00:50:11.946 --> 00:50:14.774
She is the one who is speaking, the father is quiet.

00:50:14.894 --> 00:50:16.712
He’s much more shocked than the mother.

00:50:16.832 --> 00:50:22.589
Is a common thing you see. Normally a mother should be shocked.

00:50:26.605 --> 00:50:30.140
So what is the principle of Mahalakshmi?

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:34.445
Is that first is of sacrifice.

00:50:36.286 --> 00:50:45.828
Sacrifice their own children on the altar of truth.

00:50:46.573 --> 00:50:49.958
Of course that is not needed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:50.078 --> 00:50:51.287
You are all blessed people,

00:50:51.407 --> 00:50:54.790
you don’t have to sacrifice anything whatsoever.

00:50:54.910 --> 00:51:03.622
But if you do not develop your children into proper ways,

00:51:03.742 --> 00:51:07.184
they will hold you responsible

00:51:10.373 --> 00:51:17.127
and they will say, “Why did you not give us a full scope to develop?”

00:51:21.182 --> 00:51:25.025
If you find your child is obstinate,

00:51:25.145 --> 00:51:30.131
if you find your child is miserly,

00:51:30.251 --> 00:51:34.605
if you find your child he doesn’t know how to share love with others

00:51:34.725 --> 00:51:38.824
or dominating, try to curb it down immediately.

00:51:38.944 --> 00:51:42.526
Children are very clever, extremely clever.

00:51:42.646 --> 00:51:46.015
The moment they realize that they will lose your love,

00:51:46.135 --> 00:51:48.332
they behave themselves.

00:51:52.514 --> 00:51:56.512
So this Mahalakshmi principle has to grow among men,

00:51:56.632 --> 00:52:00.212
as well as in women. We have families now

00:52:00.332 --> 00:52:02.524
and this has to work out, that,

00:52:02.644 --> 00:52:06.965
do the whole family people sit down and meditate?

00:52:09.204 --> 00:52:15.317
Do we teach our children the proper protocol of Shri Mataji?

00:52:16.467 --> 00:52:20.035
Like a lady bringing a perambulator in the hall – is absurd!

00:52:20.155 --> 00:52:26.152
I mean, can you bring a perambulator in the church?

00:52:31.247 --> 00:52:32.857
This is more than a church.

00:52:32.977 --> 00:52:36.488
Do you realize whom are you facing?

00:52:41.345 --> 00:52:44.191
And this is what you have to tell your children

00:52:44.311 --> 00:52:48.024
because this is the greatest time.

00:52:48.144 --> 00:52:50.852
This is the greatest time when you are here,

00:52:50.972 --> 00:52:53.030
the greatest time of spirituality,

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:58.194
of the complete manifestation of the powers of the Goddess,

00:52:58.314 --> 00:53:03.938
where your children have to be the real flowers of beauty.

00:53:04.058 --> 00:53:13.319
Please don’t try to cover them up with their souls dying out there

00:53:13.439 --> 00:53:16.691
under the cover of so-called love for them.

00:53:18.334 --> 00:53:22.237
So we have now three principles of Mahalakshmi that we have seen.

00:53:22.357 --> 00:53:24.682
And the fourth one is Myself.

00:53:30.482 --> 00:53:35.765
Mine is a much deeper work,

00:53:37.336 --> 00:53:42.885
much wider and tremendous patience is needed.

00:53:44.392 --> 00:53:49.104
It won’t work out if I sacrifice anyone.

00:53:49.224 --> 00:53:52.706
I have to sacrifice Myself.

00:53:53.665 --> 00:53:57.877
I have to sacrifice My family, so-called.

00:53:57.997 --> 00:54:00.983
I have to sacrifice My sleep,

00:54:01.103 --> 00:54:06.574
sacrifice comforts, everything possible under the sun.

00:54:06.694 --> 00:54:09.350
I have to sacrifice for one reason

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:13.457
that, your Mahalakshmi tattwa should be manifested.

00:54:13.577 --> 00:54:16.239
It should have its fruits.

00:54:17.326 --> 00:54:21.648
So you came to Sahaja Yoga as the seekers of truth,

00:54:21.768 --> 00:54:25.367
blessed by Mahalakshmi principle already

00:54:26.025 --> 00:54:31.989
and if that is so, let us feel it.

00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:34.368
We love our Mother. Why? Why do we love?

00:54:34.488 --> 00:54:38.205
Why do we love Her? Because She loves us.

00:54:38.325 --> 00:54:44.821
But love doesn’t mean without any effort,

00:54:47.612 --> 00:54:52.416
without any work, without any sacrifice.

00:54:52.536 --> 00:54:55.253
I don’t feel the sacrifice.

00:54:55.373 --> 00:55:00.340
I don’t feel at all anything like that.

00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:04.219
Outwardly many people say, “Mother, how much You are traveling!

00:55:04.339 --> 00:55:07.945
Mother, how much You are doing this!” I don’t feel that

00:55:08.555 --> 00:55:10.817
because I enjoy it.

00:55:13.237 --> 00:55:16.044
And that is what it is important.

00:55:16.164 --> 00:55:21.664
If we have to develop our full personality,

00:55:21.784 --> 00:55:28.513
we have to know that our love should not be only a lip service.

00:55:30.171 --> 00:55:31.753
We have to work.

00:55:33.999 --> 00:55:38.519
I’ve seen people when it comes to working for Sahaja Yoga,

00:55:38.639 --> 00:55:41.109
they just run away. Where are they?

00:55:41.229 --> 00:55:43.168
Nobody is available, all are out.

00:55:43.288 --> 00:55:47.520
Only five, six people are working. And where the rest are?

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:51.326
“Oh, they’ll only come Mother when You will come.”

00:55:56.435 --> 00:56:01.232
What work have you put in? What effort we have put in?

00:56:02.193 --> 00:56:05.945
We, just we are enjoying ourselves, all right.

00:56:06.588 --> 00:56:09.450
But enjoyment without any effort,

00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:16.789
enjoyment without any sacrifice cannot be complete.

00:56:18.543 --> 00:56:21.200
If you are attached to your comfort, to your laziness,

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:23.346
to your selfishness and all that,

00:56:23.466 --> 00:56:27.922
of course that will be there, but you cannot enjoy.

00:56:28.517 --> 00:56:30.452
You cannot enjoy.

00:56:30.572 --> 00:56:33.943
You’ll only enjoy when you just care for enjoyment

00:56:34.063 --> 00:56:37.019
and the rest of it is finished.

00:56:38.257 --> 00:56:41.395
Now before you is your Mother.

00:56:44.451 --> 00:56:46.837
I’ve seen yesterday people were sleepy.

00:56:46.957 --> 00:56:50.206
Today also there are many who are sleepy, sitting here,

00:56:50.326 --> 00:56:52.789
can’t open their eyes.

00:56:55.353 --> 00:57:00.882
Why? Because they’re not yet in it.

00:57:04.688 --> 00:57:07.287
But for Me, I can keep awake for three nights,

00:57:07.407 --> 00:57:10.338
ten nights, twelve nights,

00:57:10.458 --> 00:57:16.311
and I can sleep for one hour or for one year, if I want.

00:57:17.112 --> 00:57:22.223
Because everything is under command. Why is it in command?

00:57:22.343 --> 00:57:27.757
Because I love. This is the power of love.

00:57:27.877 --> 00:57:32.653
The power of love gives you complete command over everything,

00:57:33.407 --> 00:57:39.406
over your body, your mind, over your ego, over everything.

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:44.086
Complete command, power of love.

00:57:44.832 --> 00:57:50.303
Now I went to Greece

00:57:50.423 --> 00:57:52.705
and you know what things I brought from there.

00:57:52.825 --> 00:57:55.621
And then we went into this shop to buy some things

00:57:55.741 --> 00:57:59.286
for your Diwali Puja. But they were so expensive!

00:57:59.406 --> 00:58:03.296
I said, “No, no, no, no, it’s too much, too much.”

00:58:03.827 --> 00:58:06.291
But they’ll buy something.

00:58:06.862 --> 00:58:12.766
We found out that, that was sold in here in Italy.

00:58:12.886 --> 00:58:16.566
But can you believe that is sold in Padova?

00:58:16.686 --> 00:58:20.895
When you are having your puja here,

00:58:21.015 --> 00:58:26.113
the presents are sold here at a very cheap price, ten times less!

00:58:26.851 --> 00:58:32.841
Now who has arranged all this? This power of love.

00:58:32.961 --> 00:58:40.048
If you love someone without any expectations,

00:58:40.168 --> 00:58:46.506
then this power of love just floods you with things,

00:58:46.626 --> 00:58:49.661
with ideas, with everything.

00:58:50.336 --> 00:58:56.106
But just try to understand. It should be pure love,

00:58:56.645 --> 00:59:00.473
without thinking, pure love,

00:59:01.187 --> 00:59:10.906
just a feeling that I’m enjoying it, anything.

00:59:12.498 --> 00:59:16.891
The whole day I went there and Hamir was quite upset

00:59:17.011 --> 00:59:19.886
that Mother, poor thing, had to be without food, had to do.

00:59:20.006 --> 00:59:22.668
But I was just enjoying.

00:59:24.121 --> 00:59:26.092
He was feeling that I’m working so hard.

00:59:26.212 --> 00:59:29.484
I didn’t feel that way, just enjoying.

00:59:31.595 --> 00:59:34.830
But this enjoyment is not possible for a person

00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:39.526
who has not become the pure love. Is that the trouble is.

00:59:39.646 --> 00:59:45.355
The source of enjoyment is this power of love

00:59:46.257 --> 00:59:51.604
and it won’t fill the heart which does not have love.

00:59:54.794 --> 00:59:56.584
As simple as that.

00:59:56.704 --> 01:00:04.213
So when we are celebrating here today, these lights are what?

01:00:05.416 --> 01:00:13.657
They love. They are burning just to give you the joy.

01:00:14.474 --> 01:00:19.655
Even flowers, even fruits, the whole nature.

01:00:19.775 --> 01:00:23.875
What can the Fruits do, we eat them, we enjoy them.

01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:27.934
They like it. What do the flowers? They come out

01:00:28.054 --> 01:00:31.384
for a short time, they live, we bring them here,

01:00:31.504 --> 01:00:35.555
we spread them, we enjoy them. They are happy about it.

01:00:36.109 --> 01:00:39.120
They’re happy that they’re touching Mother’s feet.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.382
But what they’re going to disappear tomorrow.

01:00:41.502 --> 01:00:45.830
They’re going to die tomorrow. They’re not going to live long.

01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:49.152
But this is the greatest moment for them.

01:00:51.977 --> 01:00:55.143
They ask a flower, “What do you want?”

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:59.067
Said, “I don’t want any kingdom, I don’t want anything

01:00:59.187 --> 01:01:01.743
but the road on which Adi Shakti is going to walk,

01:01:01.863 --> 01:01:05.824
please throw me there. That’s all. That’s all I want.”

01:01:05.944 --> 01:01:11.199
What is such enjoyment in that,

01:01:11.319 --> 01:01:14.851
that we don’t want any kingdom, we don’t want anything, nothing?

01:01:14.971 --> 01:01:20.445
What is that in there? Is the pouring of this love into you.

01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:23.255
Completely filling you up.

01:01:23.375 --> 01:01:29.548
That it is so evident you can see it,

01:01:29.668 --> 01:01:35.300
living example before you. That’s how I’ve lived all My life.

01:01:36.014 --> 01:01:38.032
I don’t feel sleepy.

01:01:38.152 --> 01:01:42.362
You’ve never seen Me sleeping in any program, have I?

01:01:42.482 --> 01:01:44.476
But I can see many even now sleeping.

01:01:44.596 --> 01:01:50.690
I mean you have to wake them up. I can’t understand.

01:01:51.023 --> 01:01:55.170
Because their hearts are not open.

01:01:57.099 --> 01:02:00.262
If they open their heart, they can’t sleep,

01:02:00.382 --> 01:02:06.243
even if they want to. They’re sitting before Me,

01:02:06.363 --> 01:02:09.812
why should they close their eyes after all?

01:02:10.519 --> 01:02:12.656
Is the most surprising thing

01:02:12.776 --> 01:02:15.397
that they’ll go and touch the feet of My photograph

01:02:15.517 --> 01:02:18.205
and before Me they will sleep.

01:02:21.714 --> 01:02:23.962
It’s absurd!

01:02:24.082 --> 01:02:28.769
So you must know, all of you have got that depth.

01:02:28.889 --> 01:02:30.670
All have that beauty within you

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:34.229
but you should be intelligent enough to see this point

01:02:34.697 --> 01:02:41.441
that, have we touched that point? Are we lost in that point?

01:02:41.561 --> 01:02:42.626
Now you introspect.

01:02:42.746 --> 01:02:45.426
What I’m saying don’t think of others, think of yourself.

01:02:45.546 --> 01:02:47.908
Have we got that?

01:02:49.251 --> 01:02:53.209
On this day of Diwali looking at these beautiful lights

01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:55.527
which will disappear,

01:02:56.448 --> 01:03:01.159
even a moment of that think that they are, they’re so happy.

01:03:01.279 --> 01:03:06.230
So have we touched our, that beautiful thing

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:10.231
which is eternal within us? Have we touched it?

01:03:11.655 --> 01:03:14.679
You ask anyone, “Do you meditate?”

01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:18.823
You eat your food, all right.

01:03:18.943 --> 01:03:24.017
I asked you about meditation, why is it so?

01:03:27.831 --> 01:03:30.287
Do you look after yourself?

01:03:33.370 --> 01:03:38.157
What are you looking at, wasting our lives?

01:03:38.277 --> 01:03:43.118
Every moment is so precious, every day is so precious,

01:03:43.238 --> 01:03:45.469
every year so precious.

01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:51.379
Sahaja Yoga is progressing very fast and you people have to decide

01:03:51.499 --> 01:03:57.657
that now your Mahalakshmi tattwa has to give its fruits.

01:03:57.777 --> 01:04:02.503
Let’s see. I was happy to see you so happy, joyous.

01:04:03.813 --> 01:04:06.717
I wish you could give this joy to each other.

01:04:06.837 --> 01:04:09.729
That gives Me the greatest pleasure.

01:04:11.039 --> 01:04:14.636
Of course now there aren’t much fights and nothing’s going on but

01:04:14.756 --> 01:04:17.512
there are small, small things where I find

01:04:17.632 --> 01:04:21.749
people have funny feelings about each other.

01:04:24.209 --> 01:04:26.375
So forget about it. You are Sahaja yogis.

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:29.768
After all, what is going to happen?

01:04:29.888 --> 01:04:32.803
Everybody has to die in any case.

01:04:32.923 --> 01:04:39.846
But at least you led a life of spirituality, of eternity.

01:04:39.966 --> 01:04:42.749
See, look at them. They all know they have to die but,

01:04:42.869 --> 01:04:46.520
“Let’s burn as much as we can.”

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:53.350
We have the light. Everybody doesn’t have the light. “Let’s burn.”

01:04:56.834 --> 01:05:00.799
This is to be understood and then you’ll enjoy.

01:05:00.919 --> 01:05:05.188
Even the shortest life which is like a shooting star

01:05:05.308 --> 01:05:13.637
is worth something than a boring life of a dead person.

01:05:20.859 --> 01:05:24.324
The child is crying tell her to take away the child.

01:05:30.872 --> 01:05:38.770
So for this, the protocol has to be understood.

01:05:40.587 --> 01:05:43.450
It’s very important to understand protocol

01:05:43.799 --> 01:05:50.253
and the protocol is this, that you are not to question Me.

01:05:51.771 --> 01:05:56.054
You are not to question Me, you are not to doubt Me.

01:05:56.174 --> 01:06:00.769
This is very important if you have to keep your Sahastrara open.

01:06:02.007 --> 01:06:07.568
If you have any doubts, then know that you are not yet there.

01:06:07.688 --> 01:06:10.833
Please keep your Sahastrara open.

01:06:10.953 --> 01:06:16.191
Without your Sahastrara being open you cannot do anything.

01:06:16.311 --> 01:06:20.696
Surrender means nothing but keep your Sahastrara open.

01:06:20.816 --> 01:06:24.016
This is the way you are going to grow.

01:06:24.136 --> 01:06:27.139
What are you going to surrender to Me?

01:06:27.259 --> 01:06:31.508
I can create the whole world like I create worlds after worlds.

01:06:31.628 --> 01:06:37.298
What are you going to give Me? But just surrender.

01:06:39.076 --> 01:06:41.494
You have to give nothing to Mother,

01:06:41.614 --> 01:06:44.108
you have to be one with Her,

01:06:44.228 --> 01:06:46.270
you have to be lost in Her,

01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:50.218
is to enjoy Her, to know Her.

01:06:51.798 --> 01:06:53.435
That is the day

01:06:53.555 --> 01:06:56.337
when there will be a perfect Diwali in this whole world.

01:06:56.457 --> 01:07:01.396
I’ll see My children becoming great lights

01:07:01.516 --> 01:07:06.465
of knowledge, truth, peace and joy.

01:07:06.965 --> 01:07:10.161
That is the day I’m going to feel

01:07:10.281 --> 01:07:13.315
that we have done the job alright.

01:07:15.649 --> 01:07:19.167
And let’s have that real Diwali.

01:07:19.287 --> 01:07:22.753
And I’m sure it’s going to be very soon.

01:07:22.873 --> 01:07:27.487
Why not compete with other countries in this like Russia,

01:07:27.607 --> 01:07:34.865
like Bulgaria instead of competing in nonsense.

01:07:34.985 --> 01:07:39.301
Let’s compete. How many Sahaja Yogis we have got?

01:07:40.818 --> 01:07:45.062
What have we got to be given for Sahaja Yoga?

01:07:48.771 --> 01:07:55.437
All this will create such a beautiful personality of self respect

01:07:55.557 --> 01:07:57.989
because unless and until you have Self-knowledge

01:07:58.109 --> 01:08:00.928
you cannot have respect for it. But now you have Self-knowledge

01:08:01.048 --> 01:08:04.057
so the whole thing is going to change.

01:08:04.177 --> 01:08:06.371
Today I wanted to speak to you more than the puja.

01:08:06.491 --> 01:08:09.840
Is a short puja, is not a very big puja for Lakshmi

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.272
because is already within you.

01:08:12.392 --> 01:08:16.554
But in this short puja I wanted to speak to you

01:08:16.674 --> 01:08:21.144
that now you must respect the Mahalakshmi tattwa.

01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:23.428
Now Mahalakshmi tattwa has got four sides.

01:08:23.548 --> 01:08:27.543
Is the first is the Lakshmi tattwa which I told you is the love,

01:08:27.663 --> 01:08:31.538
to express your Lakshmi principle, to be generous.

01:08:31.658 --> 01:08:35.066
Then we have got the Raja Lakshmi.

01:08:35.186 --> 01:08:40.087
Raja Lakshmi principle is that you are like a king

01:08:40.207 --> 01:08:46.141
“I am the realized soul, so what! I’m like a king!”

01:08:46.261 --> 01:08:48.963
The kings don’t beg, do they?

01:08:49.083 --> 01:08:52.061
I mean if they beg then they are beggars, they are not kings.

01:08:52.181 --> 01:08:56.059
Of course these days I don’t know what the kings are doing.

01:08:56.695 --> 01:09:04.335
But, we are kings, we are royal. We walk like royal people.

01:09:05.597 --> 01:09:08.643
I mean I see people sometimes

01:09:09.087 --> 01:09:12.486
walking in a manner that doesn’t behove a Sahaja yogi,

01:09:12.606 --> 01:09:16.269
living in a manner that doesn’t behove a Sahaja yogi.

01:09:17.809 --> 01:09:22.553
We have to walk with the dignity of a king.

01:09:23.252 --> 01:09:26.289
And the king is the one who gives, who doesn’t take anything.

01:09:26.409 --> 01:09:29.204
Is the Raja Lakshmi principle in you, has to come,

01:09:29.324 --> 01:09:31.537
in all the ladies.

01:09:32.036 --> 01:09:37.846
You see so, also ladies should not give way to fashions.

01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:39.682
If you start changing your fashions

01:09:39.802 --> 01:09:43.208
that means you are not at all from the royal family.

01:09:43.328 --> 01:09:45.791
I went to Japan. You’ll be surprised,

01:09:45.911 --> 01:09:48.534
they were very respectful to us, extremely respectful.

01:09:48.654 --> 01:09:51.487
I couldn’t understand, you know, Me and My daughters.

01:09:51.607 --> 01:09:53.308
So we asked the interpreter. I said,

01:09:53.428 --> 01:09:55.058
“Why are they so respectful to us?

01:09:55.178 --> 01:09:58.661
Everywhere we went they gave us the present and bowed to us?”

01:09:58.781 --> 01:10:01.498
He said, “Because they think You are from royal family.”

01:10:01.618 --> 01:10:04.509
I said, “Why, why do they think we are from royal family?”

01:10:04.629 --> 01:10:06.948
“Because You comb Your hair so well

01:10:07.068 --> 01:10:11.562
and that You don’t go to any hairdresser.

01:10:11.682 --> 01:10:15.427
Royal family people never go to any hairdresser get their heads to.

01:10:15.547 --> 01:10:17.469
Because Your hair are so well done.

01:10:17.589 --> 01:10:21.011
That’s why they think You must be from the royal family.”

01:10:21.131 --> 01:10:23.696
Can you imagine? While we are like bhoots,

01:10:23.816 --> 01:10:26.843
how can we be Sahaja yogis?

01:10:27.264 --> 01:10:30.427
Tomorrow you have to wear the crowns.

01:10:30.547 --> 01:10:32.549
We should not have dresses like beggars.

01:10:32.669 --> 01:10:37.218
Do you think so that’s the sign of a royal family person?

01:10:37.338 --> 01:10:43.709
You must dress up well, neat, clean, not like a sanyasi,

01:10:43.829 --> 01:10:50.565
colorful, beautiful but with dignity.

01:10:52.484 --> 01:10:54.801
It should not be a fashion.

01:10:54.921 --> 01:11:01.135
Fashion is taken by ordinary people, by vulgar [people].

01:11:01.469 --> 01:11:05.110
King doesn’t take the fashion, does he?

01:11:06.149 --> 01:11:11.107
He creates the fashion. He doesn’t take fashions.

01:11:11.227 --> 01:11:14.144
So you play into the hands of the fashions, this…

01:11:14.264 --> 01:11:16.241
Recently I heard the fashion is

01:11:16.361 --> 01:11:18.506
for women is to have their hair here.

01:11:18.626 --> 01:11:23.660
Why? Closing the Agnya like that?

01:11:27.499 --> 01:11:31.814
If you are playing into the hands of these modern entrepreneurs

01:11:31.934 --> 01:11:33.832
and modern ideas and all those things,

01:11:33.952 --> 01:11:36.723
then know that you have no a personality of a Sahaja yogi.

01:11:36.843 --> 01:11:40.195
A Sahaja yogi has his own personality.

01:11:40.315 --> 01:11:43.005
He doesn’t change according to somebody says, “All right,

01:11:43.125 --> 01:11:46.486
everybody is like this, so you should be like that.”

01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:52.254
He has his own style and he has own ways of dressing up.

01:11:52.374 --> 01:11:57.021
In everyday life also a royal person is such,

01:11:57.141 --> 01:12:00.175
the whole dignity of a royal person.

01:12:00.295 --> 01:12:01.917
You don’t take money from others.

01:12:02.037 --> 01:12:04.467
You don’t borrow money from others.

01:12:04.587 --> 01:12:07.105
Do you think the king, the day he starts borrowing money,

01:12:07.225 --> 01:12:09.884
he’ll no more be a king.

01:12:13.102 --> 01:12:17.297
Then a royal person always talks with a dignity

01:12:17.417 --> 01:12:20.549
as well as respect of the dignity of others.

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:34.005
He doesn’t use cheap words, slangs. Royal language he uses.

01:12:36.333 --> 01:12:41.631
Now these slangs I do not know,

01:12:41.751 --> 01:12:44.324
I do not know much about them

01:12:44.444 --> 01:12:51.577
but is very much in the fashion that you go on in a slangy way.

01:12:51.697 --> 01:12:58.114
You ask somebody some questions “eaah! eaah!”

01:12:58.234 --> 01:13:01.765
Is this the way a king would speak?

01:13:05.919 --> 01:13:09.342
I tell you in every behavior,

01:13:09.462 --> 01:13:12.794
if you know that you are the king and you are the queen,

01:13:12.914 --> 01:13:17.385
the whole personality will change.

01:13:17.505 --> 01:13:21.046
But a beggar, if you bring the beggar and put him on the chair of a king,

01:13:21.166 --> 01:13:25.584
still he is, anybody coming, “Please give me something.”

01:13:27.053 --> 01:13:30.908
Wearing the crown he says “Oh, Please get me..”

01:13:33.321 --> 01:13:38.525
Now you are sitting on the thrones.

01:13:38.645 --> 01:13:45.564
In Sanskrit word is, in Hindi they say, virargj, virargji.

01:13:45.684 --> 01:13:49.631
Let this kingdom show through your behavior.

01:13:49.751 --> 01:13:56.164
The kingdom of God, show in your behavior.

01:13:56.284 --> 01:14:00.606
If you are a miserable creature, a TB patient,

01:14:00.726 --> 01:14:05.316
how can you be of the royal family?

01:14:07.086 --> 01:14:12.675
If you are a lanky-panky person how can you wear your swords?

01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:16.505
The other day they gave Me one sword to hold.

01:14:16.625 --> 01:14:20.507
I tell you many of you cannot hold it, it’s so heavy.

01:14:20.627 --> 01:14:23.686
But in My Royal Spirit, I can.

01:14:26.273 --> 01:14:27.855
Same with the ladies

01:14:27.975 --> 01:14:32.313
if they have to wear the dresses of a royal family.

01:14:32.433 --> 01:14:39.256
Even to wear the crown you have to have a head that is capable.

01:14:41.201 --> 01:14:44.346
So that royal nature has to come in your own behavior,

01:14:44.466 --> 01:14:48.000
when you talk to others and anyone.

01:14:49.873 --> 01:14:54.042
Like royal people never ask questions, never.

01:14:54.162 --> 01:14:57.324
“Hmm,” they will say. “Hmm.”

01:14:59.593 --> 01:15:01.433
But a beggar will ask a question.

01:15:01.553 --> 01:15:06.397
We call him a sawali, the one who ask a question all the time.

01:15:08.373 --> 01:15:10.833
But why should a king ask when he knows all the answers.

01:15:10.953 --> 01:15:14.128
Why should he ask for any questions?

01:15:16.183 --> 01:15:18.799
I know some people who are such headaches.

01:15:18.919 --> 01:15:24.575
Now say I’m in the road. “Will You take white water or blue water?”

01:15:24.695 --> 01:15:29.109
“Baba, I take water whether blue, white anything and that’s all.”

01:15:29.229 --> 01:15:31.799
Then they’ll say, “Will You take a white comb or a red comb?”

01:15:31.919 --> 01:15:34.522
“Arey bhai, give anything.”

01:15:35.236 --> 01:15:38.330
By their asking only you get fed up that “I don’t want anything.

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:40.895
Now get out of the road, please.”

01:15:42.514 --> 01:15:47.536
Then another style is, “I have a problema, a problema.”

01:15:47.656 --> 01:15:52.341
Nothing problem, problema. “What is the problema?”

01:15:52.461 --> 01:15:56.216
“I don’t know how to carry on with my job.”

01:15:56.779 --> 01:16:01.043
Problema. Because you are a problem, that must be this problema.

01:16:01.163 --> 01:16:03.145
But Mother doesn’t say, it’s all right.

01:16:03.266 --> 01:16:06.843
She will suggest one thing. “But in this, this”,

01:16:06.963 --> 01:16:10.044
then She suggests another solution. “But in this, this”,

01:16:10.164 --> 01:16:11.722
then suggests three solutions.

01:16:11.842 --> 01:16:14.510
She will go on suggesting ten solutions.

01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:17.068
Still you will forget it’s your problem,

01:16:17.188 --> 01:16:20.684
you think it’s Mother’s problem you are discussing.

01:16:22.104 --> 01:16:25.315
This is not the way the king is. The king gives solutions,

01:16:25.435 --> 01:16:28.675
he doesn’t ask for solutions.

01:16:28.795 --> 01:16:31.830
Otherwise should he be king?

01:16:34.941 --> 01:16:39.069
And once you decide, “I am the king and I am going to solve my problems,”

01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:41.976
the problems should be solved like this.

01:16:42.096 --> 01:16:44.511
Do I tell you My problems any time?

01:16:44.631 --> 01:16:48.870
I never use this word also – problem. This is a modern word.

01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:51.438
‘Problem’ we used to only use in mathematics,

01:16:51.558 --> 01:16:56.830
I think in geometry so far, really!

01:16:58.314 --> 01:17:02.454
We didn’t know that it was used in general life.

01:17:02.574 --> 01:17:05.994
So if you are the king you solve your problem.

01:17:06.115 --> 01:17:08.442
If you solve your problem, then you are a king.

01:17:08.562 --> 01:17:12.866
If you cannot solve your problem then you are a beggar.

01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:18.743
Then cheap things.

01:17:19.648 --> 01:17:23.533
To use cheap material, cheap things, cheap language,

01:17:23.653 --> 01:17:29.683
everything cheapish, is not a sign of a king.

01:17:33.381 --> 01:17:38.175
I would buy one sari in the whole year but a good quality sari.

01:17:38.295 --> 01:17:41.261
And I’ve got saris since My marriage, even before My marriage.

01:17:41.381 --> 01:17:45.041
All those saris are with Me because I would buy only one sari

01:17:45.161 --> 01:17:50.282
of a good quality once a year, finished!

01:17:50.402 --> 01:17:55.101
And traditional, not cheapish. But people will have twenty saris

01:17:55.221 --> 01:17:57.111
and they didn’t know what to wear.

01:17:57.231 --> 01:17:58.911
They’ll still walk out saying,

01:17:59.031 --> 01:18:01.612
“I have a problema, I have no sari.”

01:18:01.732 --> 01:18:05.396
Because all saris are very cheapish you have bought.

01:18:05.516 --> 01:18:09.798
Same with men. Same with men. They try to save money,

01:18:09.918 --> 01:18:12.007
penny-wise pound foolishness.

01:18:12.127 --> 01:18:16.376
And if you ask them. “Mother, You know what happened,

01:18:16.496 --> 01:18:17.610
I have no clothes.”

01:18:17.730 --> 01:18:20.255
“All right you come without clothes, then what to do?”

01:18:20.375 --> 01:18:21.803
“No but there is this.”

01:18:21.923 --> 01:18:24.813
“All right, then do one thing.”

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:31.185
It is impossible to tell them that this is stupid.

01:18:35.221 --> 01:18:40.678
You are the king, the way you talk to each other.

01:18:40.798 --> 01:18:44.834
A king doesn’t talk too much, doesn’t.

01:18:44.954 --> 01:18:48.871
If you are too talkative then remember you are not a king.

01:18:48.991 --> 01:18:54.867
The king doesn’t talk too much, very little, ‘yes’ or ‘no’.

01:18:54.987 --> 01:18:58.590
Or whenever he has to talk, he talks sense.

01:18:58.710 --> 01:19:06.214
Also he is not glum. Another extreme are glum people.

01:19:06.334 --> 01:19:09.561
You don’t know how you stand with them.

01:19:10.188 --> 01:19:15.439
So one has to know that you are in charge of yourself as a king

01:19:15.559 --> 01:19:19.658
or a queen and you carry yourself with that dignity.

01:19:19.778 --> 01:19:24.092
You do not shout. You do not say things slowly,

01:19:24.212 --> 01:19:27.325
as if you neck is chocked.

01:19:27.445 --> 01:19:30.194
Some Sahaja yogis talk like that.

01:19:30.314 --> 01:19:34.015
They think it’s very, they are kind to Me.

01:19:34.642 --> 01:19:46.144
No, in freedom, but not shouting at Me and in a dignified manner.

01:19:49.267 --> 01:19:53.374
Dignity is something cannot be taught.

01:19:53.494 --> 01:19:56.410
It has to be inside yourself.

01:19:58.799 --> 01:20:05.952
A person is not self conscious but is conscious of his dignity.

01:20:08.812 --> 01:20:11.453
He doesn’t do cheap things, never.

01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:13.989
Never the cheap things, you know.

01:20:15.068 --> 01:20:17.626
Once a gentleman met My husband.

01:20:17.746 --> 01:20:19.605
He said, “Why don’t you come and dance?”

01:20:19.725 --> 01:20:22.345
He said, “No, I don’t dance because My wife doesn’t dance.”

01:20:22.465 --> 01:20:24.751
He said, “Bring Her to England, She will start dancing.”

01:20:24.871 --> 01:20:27.516
He said, “You take Her to Moon also She won’t do.”

01:20:27.636 --> 01:20:28.908
That’s what My husband told.

01:20:29.028 --> 01:20:32.935
“She’s not going to dance with this kind of a ball room dancing.

01:20:33.055 --> 01:20:35.947
That She will not dance.”

01:20:40.105 --> 01:20:43.971
It’s for the men and women to understand,

01:20:44.883 --> 01:20:46.719
that is not dignified.

01:20:46.839 --> 01:20:49.150
On this point you should decide,

01:20:49.270 --> 01:20:51.860
“If this is not dignified we are not going to do it.

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:56.134
We are from the royal family of Shalivahanas

01:20:58.101 --> 01:21:01.808
and we are not going to do anything that is undignified.”

01:21:05.316 --> 01:21:10.889
All the ladies, all the men, all the Sahaja yoginis

01:21:11.009 --> 01:21:14.784
and the Sahaja yogis are very different from all others.

01:21:14.904 --> 01:21:17.950
And this is what we have to understand,

01:21:18.608 --> 01:21:23.303
that how dignified we are for a Raja Lakshmi.

01:21:23.423 --> 01:21:27.171
Then the Gruha Lakshmi I’ve already told you.

01:21:27.291 --> 01:21:29.971
And the Lakshmi tattwa I’ve already told you.

01:21:30.091 --> 01:21:34.847
But there is another principle which is called alakshmi

01:21:34.967 --> 01:21:41.648
and that alakshmi principle is where you may have everything,

01:21:41.768 --> 01:21:46.018
but you are a beggar, alakshmi.

01:21:51.422 --> 01:21:54.759
And that is what is to be avoided.

01:21:56.219 --> 01:22:00.582
Alakshmi, without any Lakshmi principle.

01:22:01.549 --> 01:22:04.774
Then there is kulakshmi.

01:22:04.894 --> 01:22:08.394
Kulakshmi is when you use your money for wrong things.

01:22:08.965 --> 01:22:15.217
You use your money for drugs, for this, that, for bad business.

01:22:16.185 --> 01:22:19.135
Whatever business you do you should know what you are doing,

01:22:19.255 --> 01:22:24.019
is for what. Kulakshmi.

01:22:25.939 --> 01:22:28.772
Grabbing the money of Sahaja yogis or Sahaja Yoga

01:22:28.892 --> 01:22:33.752
is the worst type of a Lakshmi, it’s very, very serious.

01:22:35.895 --> 01:22:39.324
So that’s how you come down.

01:22:39.444 --> 01:22:44.152
And, now when you see the whole world is, how it is,

01:22:44.272 --> 01:22:47.417
when you have to pull it out, you have to have more strength,

01:22:47.537 --> 01:22:51.866
more strength to pull them out, strength of love.

01:22:51.986 --> 01:22:57.094
Again we come to the same point: strength of love.

01:22:59.943 --> 01:23:02.565
That’s the strength keeps Me laughing all the time,

01:23:02.685 --> 01:23:05.200
enjoying Myself.

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:17.200
Even a least [part] of this joy I cannot give up.

01:23:19.913 --> 01:23:22.192
In the same way I bless you

01:23:22.312 --> 01:23:25.330
with all the Lakshmi principle and Mahalakshmi principle

01:23:25.450 --> 01:23:28.761
but above all the principle of love,

01:23:28.881 --> 01:23:33.473
the pure love without any expectations, nirvajya.

01:23:33.593 --> 01:23:36.708
I bless you all on this auspicious day.

01:23:36.828 --> 01:23:39.900
May God bless you!Have wisdom

01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:42.682
and understand that Mother has said it out of Her heart,

01:23:42.802 --> 01:23:47.436
out of Her love, out of Her feelings for us.

01:23:47.556 --> 01:23:48.756
May God bless you!
