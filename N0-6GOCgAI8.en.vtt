00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:10.681
(Some Sahajis) don't understand what is God is.

00:00:12.472 --> 00:00:14.514
But it's not the understanding

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.681
- in a way you understand this one little point,

00:00:17.098 --> 00:00:20.890
that it comes from your heart into your brain,

00:00:21.432 --> 00:00:24.848
not from brain to your heart.

00:00:27.223 --> 00:00:30.140
It comes

00:00:30.514 --> 00:00:33.764
as if the ambrosia of

00:00:34.056 --> 00:00:38.307
your bhakti covers your brain, absolutely.

00:00:40.931 --> 00:00:42.056
Say for example,

00:00:42.307 --> 00:00:45.390
Shankaracharya wrote a beautiful treatise

00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:47.015
called as "Viveka Chudamani"

00:00:47.307 --> 00:00:49.931
where he described what is God, this, that;

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:52.681
and "viveka" means the conscience,

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:56.806
and consciousness and all that he described quite a lot.

00:00:58.182 --> 00:01:00.390
But there was one horrible fellow called Sarma

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:03.848
who started arguing with him and he got fed up,

00:01:04.182 --> 00:01:05.598
Shankaracharya.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.182
He said, "No use talking to them."

00:01:08.432 --> 00:01:11.307
So he just wrote "Saundarya Lahari."

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:14.472
"Saundarya Lahari" is nothing but all the mantras

00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:15.514
praising the Mother.

00:01:15.848 --> 00:01:18.140
He said, "Why, I know Mother, now let me praise Her.

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:22.015
Nothing doing - what's the use of talking to these people?

00:01:22.472 --> 00:01:24.556
Stupid things, how will they understand?"

00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:29.472
He realized that "These people haven't got that capacity,

00:01:29.764 --> 00:01:34.348
that sensitivity to understand what I know."

00:01:34.764 --> 00:01:40.098
That's the real knowledge, is to know what is God.

00:01:40.514 --> 00:01:42.973
And if that is God,

00:01:43.307 --> 00:01:46.514
then how can you suspect anything,

00:01:46.848 --> 00:01:49.848
how can you

00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:52.806
try to analyze anything?

00:01:53.098 --> 00:01:56.806
It's God. It's God Almighty,

00:01:57.265 --> 00:01:59.514
which knows everything,

00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:01.931
which does everything,

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.098
which enjoys everything.

00:02:05.681 --> 00:02:09.473
That is the one you should say is the gyana,

00:02:09.806 --> 00:02:11.514
is the knowledge, is the true knowledge,

00:02:11.806 --> 00:02:12.931
the pure knowledge.

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:15.473
It's not the knowledge of chakras,

00:02:15.848 --> 00:02:17.848
not the knowledge of vibrations,

00:02:18.307 --> 00:02:20.098
not the knowledge of kundalini,

00:02:20.432 --> 00:02:24.848
but the knowledge of God Almighty.

00:02:25.348 --> 00:02:28.931
And the knowledge of God Almighty is not mental.

00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:30.472
Again I tell you,

00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:35.223
it starts from your heart and goes to your brain,

00:02:36.015 --> 00:02:42.681
something that comes out of your experience of joy

00:02:43.098 --> 00:02:44.390
and covers your brain.

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.265
So your brain cannot deny it any more.

00:02:47.556 --> 00:02:50.473
Like the - sometimes when you have your mother,

00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:53.931
little mother, you know the love of your mother.

00:02:54.265 --> 00:02:57.472
But you cannot explain, it comes from your heart

00:02:57.806 --> 00:02:59.223
and you say, "No, that's my mother,

00:02:59.472 --> 00:03:02.348
she won't do like that. I know my mother very well."

00:03:02.764 --> 00:03:04.472
The knowledge about your mother,

00:03:04.806 --> 00:03:07.223
the one who has given you birth;

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.098
may not be, mother may not be very good or whatever it is.

00:03:11.472 --> 00:03:13.806
But knowledge about God,

00:03:14.223 --> 00:03:16.390
that He's love, that He's truth,

00:03:16.764 --> 00:03:18.514
that He knows everything,

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.015
that just become part and parcel of your being, absolutely,

00:03:24.348 --> 00:03:28.973
and that's the time we say is the nirvana.

00:03:30.973 --> 00:03:32.764
So it's important,

00:03:33.098 --> 00:03:36.015
specially for the people of the West,

00:03:36.348 --> 00:03:38.472
now open your hearts,

00:03:38.764 --> 00:03:42.890
because it starts from the heart, not from your brain.

00:03:47.265 --> 00:03:49.764
Do not judge people on vibrations.

00:03:50.098 --> 00:03:53.639
Judge yourself, all the time.

00:03:54.098 --> 00:03:59.098
I had told that Shiva Puja means more explanation,

00:03:59.348 --> 00:04:01.390
more understanding, more this thing;

00:04:01.681 --> 00:04:07.556
because in other pujas we do all these mantras, this, that,

00:04:09.223 --> 00:04:14.473
but in this puja is to know the knowledge,

00:04:14.931 --> 00:04:17.764
it's God.

00:04:18.223 --> 00:04:22.223
And to know that you know God itself is so great.

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:28.056
Whatever it is - She may be Mahamaya,

00:04:28.307 --> 00:04:31.723
She may be anything, but I know Her.

00:04:32.223 --> 00:04:33.848
It cannot be described in one book,

00:04:34.098 --> 00:04:36.764
it cannot be described in hundred books.

00:04:37.223 --> 00:04:40.182
It cannot be described in words,

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:45.098
but to know that's God - after all, that's God,

00:04:45.598 --> 00:04:48.390
God Almighty.

00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:53.472
And that gives you

00:04:53.764 --> 00:04:57.348
that beautiful surrender,

00:04:57.764 --> 00:05:01.556
where you just feel absolutely secured

00:05:04.015 --> 00:05:07.015
in that ocean of love.

00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:10.473
I wish you all to achieve that state.

00:05:11.473 --> 00:05:14.931
May God bless you.
