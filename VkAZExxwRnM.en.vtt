00:00:07.513 --> 00:00:21.721
So in such an auspicious day when we
all have come here to do this special puja,

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:27.257
and I would say this should be
called as a Mahalakshmi Puja because

00:00:27.337 --> 00:00:34.227
it’s something to do with the industry
of this country, and of the whole world.

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:44.303
Unless and until all those human ventures are connected with God

00:00:44.383 --> 00:00:49.868
they cannot get their perfect stage and their status.

00:00:49.948 --> 00:00:55.725
That’s why we have problems now in the West.
Supposed to be very clever people, very smart,

00:00:55.805 --> 00:01:01.395
very well equipped, well educated. We are having recessions
and things

00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:08.888
because they have no balance.
They don’t know that there is God’s power which works everything,

00:01:09.176 --> 00:01:15.377
and when you neglect that, this is what happens to you.

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:25.363
Now for any venture that we do of this kind,

00:01:25.443 --> 00:01:30.775
first of all we have to use a lot of material from the Mother Earth,

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:38.003
but if it is taken for a proper purpose, for constructive things

00:01:38.084 --> 00:01:43.195
and for helping others, with a balance,

00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:49.013
then Mother Earth can think, She can produce,

00:01:49.093 --> 00:01:52.716
more and more,
all this She has produced before.

00:01:52.796 --> 00:01:58.399
She can produce for people who are sensible,

00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:06.434
who are in tune with God, not just making money for themselves,

00:02:06.515 --> 00:02:17.560
or for their own purpose, but are thinking in totality,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.482
thinking as to what we can achieve by doing this.

00:02:25.903 --> 00:02:29.126
And that is how an industry can grow.

00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:32.534
Now we see in Japan so much industry has grown,

00:02:32.615 --> 00:02:35.202
but no spirituality.

00:02:35.282 --> 00:02:38.586
They are not at all happy people,

00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:44.204
their children are suffering, families are suffering.

00:02:44.285 --> 00:02:53.580
Money cannot get the total well being of a human being.

00:02:53.661 --> 00:02:57.287
So a balance has to be drawn.

00:02:57.368 --> 00:03:03.549
Especially in our country, thank God, we didn’t have
such a fast industrialization,

00:03:04.081 --> 00:03:09.040
and that’s why we are saved of lots of problems that the Western people are suffering,

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:12.164
about which the Indians are not aware.

00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:19.673
They think you are all living in a very comfortable life there.

00:03:20.817 --> 00:03:26.247
Industry has to go hand-in-hand with the handicrafts,

00:03:26.781 --> 00:03:32.600
and the industrialists have to also look after the artists,

00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:36.486
because otherwise who will look after them? How will they bring forth

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:40.695
the balance between the art and the industry?

00:03:40.775 --> 00:03:45.915
And art is such a soothing thing for these hard-working people.
They work the whole day,

00:03:45.995 --> 00:03:54.351
then there is some sort of a music, art, to console them,

00:03:54.431 --> 00:04:03.555
to give them peace, to relax them, and a balance.

00:04:03.635 --> 00:04:11.023
So I would say that all industries
must take to some artistic ventures also,

00:04:11.103 --> 00:04:13.604
or they should also produce things.

00:04:13.756 --> 00:04:17.560
After I was telling Rajesh many a times that you should try to produce

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.497
something artistic out of the steel scrap that is left over, will be a good idea.

00:04:22.578 --> 00:04:25.731
They have tried something like that.

00:04:29.838 --> 00:04:32.351
But industry should not be looked down upon

00:04:32.431 --> 00:04:34.694
as it is looked down upon in our country.

00:04:34.775 --> 00:04:40.954
I mean, as if industrialists are the greatest thieves
and all the politicians are saints in this country.

00:04:41.034 --> 00:04:44.996
It’s the other way around I think.
It should be treated with respect,

00:04:45.077 --> 00:04:49.402
and should be understood that it’s very important.

00:04:49.503 --> 00:04:54.086
And the industrialists, if they become also enlightened,

00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:59.440
they can do a lot, not only to their own country,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.198
but also to the people whom they are looking after.

00:05:03.278 --> 00:05:06.156
So in the Mahalakshmi principle,

00:05:06.236 --> 00:05:11.041
Mahalakshmi has various mudras.

00:05:11.122 --> 00:05:18.170
One of the mudra is that She puts Her right hand like this.

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:23.080
Now this right hand is to give protection to people

00:05:23.161 --> 00:05:28.130
who are under the protection, or under the service,

00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:33.069
of some rich man, or the industrialist we can call it.

00:05:33.213 --> 00:05:38.155
In India if you call somebody a rich man it’s like abusing him. Nobody likes it,

00:05:38.236 --> 00:05:41.226
because the rich are always shown

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:43.406
to be the worst people, which is not so.

00:05:43.486 --> 00:05:47.376
In My own experience it’s not so. If there’s a poor man also he could be terrible.

00:05:47.457 --> 00:05:50.296
We have had very bad experiences now, in Ganapatipule,

00:05:50.377 --> 00:05:56.902
of very poor people how they behaved
in a very funny manner - supposed to be poor.

00:05:58.535 --> 00:06:07.000
So it should be a proper balance, it should be brought to a proper balance,

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.490
between the understanding of the poor and the rich, and the rich and the poor.

00:06:13.571 --> 00:06:21.160
After some time you will find that people will not consider poverty

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:29.379
or riches as so important, but the richness of the spirit
will become very important.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.451
That is what is going to be the Sahaj nations

00:06:33.532 --> 00:06:38.353
where the richness of the heart, the spirituality,

00:06:38.433 --> 00:06:43.854
oneness with the Divine, will become the greatest boon
for everyone.
