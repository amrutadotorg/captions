00:05:55.145 --> 00:05:58.960
Today, again, is a New Year's day.

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:10.844
Every new year comes, because
we have to take to something that is new.

00:06:11.495 --> 00:06:18.638
It has been so arranged that the sun has to
move for 365 days

00:06:18.638 --> 00:06:23.070
and again a New Year has to come.

00:06:23.347 --> 00:06:29.181
Actually, the whole Solar System
is moving in a spiral way.

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:39.639
So, there is definitely a higher,
higher state of this Solar System.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.453
Every year, it is rising higher in a spiral way.

00:06:44.706 --> 00:06:50.665
So, it is not only that it is because 365 days have passed,

00:06:50.882 --> 00:06:58.608
but because it has moved a step forward higher
than what it was.

00:06:59.925 --> 00:07:05.940
Now, we can see that, in awareness,
human beings have definitely risen

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:10.962
much higher than what they were,
say, about 2000 years back.

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:23.833
But, the first system that started the whole universe
was the first model, we can say, was created.

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:28.717
And that model has to be perfect. And that
was a perfect model,

00:07:29.006 --> 00:07:33.388
which then started perfecting the rest of it.

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:42.261
So, that is the perfect model which is
in the principle of this ascent.

00:07:42.817 --> 00:07:46.485
And that is working
out this ascent.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:58.176
Now, the perfection of the rest of the universe
takes place in various directions.

00:07:58.356 --> 00:08:03.174
But today, we have to consider
the Mahalakshmi principle.

00:08:03.428 --> 00:08:10.444
Now Mahalakshmi, as I told you, is a perfect principle.

00:08:10.444 --> 00:08:16.547
It's a perfect principle. It's perfected.
It is born as perfect, will remain as perfect.

00:08:16.764 --> 00:08:22.320
It will be always eternally perfect,
so that it is not necessary to be corrected.

00:08:22.791 --> 00:08:26.685
Now this Mahalakshmi's thing, I am discussing here,

00:08:26.902 --> 00:08:31.469
because you may be able to go today to
see the temple of Mahalakshmi.

00:08:37.292 --> 00:08:42.148
Now the temple of Mahalakshmi when you go there,

00:08:42.438 --> 00:08:46.398
you have to know that this deity
has come out of the Mother Earth

00:08:46.398 --> 00:08:48.932
in this particular place.

00:08:48.932 --> 00:08:54.844
That means this place has got a capacity

00:08:54.895 --> 00:09:01.462
to give you a force, we can say, an additional force,

00:09:01.462 --> 00:09:07.445
or an intensive feeling of evolution.

00:09:07.445 --> 00:09:12.204
If you are sensitive enough you can see that, you
can feel it and you can do it.

00:09:12.204 --> 00:09:15.229
But, if you are not so sensitive, you are still so conditioned

00:09:15.229 --> 00:09:20.054
and still outside, that may not work out.

00:09:20.456 --> 00:09:26.659
I mean, all kinds of things can be done, but
if somebody wants to remain a stone,

00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:29.583
you can't do anything about it.

00:09:29.764 --> 00:09:34.799
So, this Mahalakshmi principle
is working out in this place, Kolhapur.

00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:40.162
Normally, this place
should be very, very warm because of its position.

00:09:40.187 --> 00:09:43.861
But even in summer, this place keeps very cool

00:09:43.861 --> 00:09:50.534
because of the vibrations from the temple that is emitted.

00:09:53.019 --> 00:09:57.272
The people in this place
may not be so aware either.

00:09:57.272 --> 00:10:01.919
We cannot say if they are aware because, as negativity has
to come forward,

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:08.009
there are lots of sugar factories
and lots of alcoholism going on here.

00:10:08.479 --> 00:10:15.136
But we have to take the best advantage

00:10:15.136 --> 00:10:19.306
of every place which is created specially for
a particular purpose.

00:10:19.306 --> 00:10:29.076
So, it is a pilgrimage, in a way, that we are here. That we have to
look after our Mahalakshmi principle of our ascent.

00:10:33.076 --> 00:10:38.787
As you know, this ascent starts at the Nabhi

00:10:38.787 --> 00:10:42.655
and is surrounded by the Guru principle.

00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:49.008
Now the Guru principle within us, if it is
absurd, if it is a juxtaposition,

00:10:49.008 --> 00:10:55.363
placed in a juxtaposition where, if it is not properly
embedded within us,

00:10:55.363 --> 00:11:00.379
if it is not emitting through our character and behaviour,

00:11:00.379 --> 00:11:02.827
Mahalakshmi tattva cannot be strengthened.

00:11:02.827 --> 00:11:06.942
Mahalakshmi tattva is strengthened through Guru principle.

00:11:06.942 --> 00:11:11.690
Now we are lucky today because

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:19.322
there was the birthday of Datta, Dattatreya,
just the other day, when we had the puja,

00:11:19.391 --> 00:11:24.514
and today is this Mahalakshmi puja. So two
things together we have got together.

00:11:24.514 --> 00:11:29.789
First was the Datta Puja and today is this puja
of Mahalakshmi.

00:11:29.789 --> 00:11:34.751
So, to have the Guru principle all right,
we must make our dharmas correct.

00:11:34.751 --> 00:11:38.992
Now these dharmas, as I have told you many times, are 10.

00:11:38.992 --> 00:11:44.585
And we should look after these
10 dharmas in a very careful manner.

00:11:44.585 --> 00:11:49.405
These are expressed outside, but whatever is inside
comes out.

00:11:50.221 --> 00:11:56.737
Now I find, when you people talk, and you
say things, I know that this person is negative,

00:11:56.737 --> 00:11:59.393
that person is definitely positive.

00:11:59.393 --> 00:12:03.205
There are so many ways of expression of positivity.

00:12:03.205 --> 00:12:08.023
But how I know, that I cannot tell you, because
I just don't know how to tell you that.

00:12:08.023 --> 00:12:13.955
But I just know that such a person is definitely
positive and such a person is negative.

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:19.031
The positivity lies in understanding why are we here.

00:12:19.031 --> 00:12:23.131
First of all, why are we on this earth?

00:12:23.131 --> 00:12:30.200
Why are we human beings in understanding?

00:12:30.453 --> 00:12:38.077
What are we doing about it? Why are we Sahaja Yogis?

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:44.752
What a Sahaja Yogi has to do? What
is his responsibility as a Sahaja Yogi.

00:12:44.915 --> 00:12:48.959
Then he moves forward to understand,

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:52.503
"Why Mother is so kind to me?

00:12:52.756 --> 00:12:55.141
Why have I got vibrations?

00:12:55.141 --> 00:13:01.067
Why am I among very few who have got these
special blessings,

00:13:01.067 --> 00:13:05.660
the special knowledge of vibratory awareness?"

00:13:08.222 --> 00:13:13.351
And then to ask yourself,
"What am I doing about it?

00:13:13.351 --> 00:13:19.567
Am I still very much embedded in my
cheapishness or in my childishness,

00:13:19.567 --> 00:13:25.065
in my stupidity, in my harshness, in my aggressiveness?"

00:13:25.065 --> 00:13:29.506
We always see these things in other people, not in ourselves -- so we are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:13:29.506 --> 00:13:34.384
We should understand, at that point, when we start seeing these things in other people,

00:13:34.384 --> 00:13:40.077
then we are not Sahaja Yogis.
We should see in ourselves and emit

00:13:40.294 --> 00:13:44.890
pure compassion to others.

00:13:45.072 --> 00:13:49.449
But always people see that it is in another person this exists.

00:13:49.449 --> 00:13:52.614
Whatever I may try to say, they always see in other person.

00:13:52.892 --> 00:13:57.040
Now supposing there's a negative person among us,

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.409
you need not be compassionate to that person.

00:13:59.409 --> 00:14:04.965
On the contrary, better be away. Get rid of that person,
as far as possible don't have anything to do.

00:14:04.965 --> 00:14:10.619
It's a definite sign of great
compassion to yourself, if not to others.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:15.809
Better not have anything to do with the person
who is negative, if you have to come up.

00:14:15.809 --> 00:14:23.583
He may be your brother, sister, anyone. But try
to be away from a person who is not positive.

00:14:23.583 --> 00:14:27.090
It causes lots of problems.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:32.134
I have been telling you this, and I have been requesting you, but the conditioning is such

00:14:32.134 --> 00:14:37.287
that, still though you have become a Guru tattva,
you don't understand that you have to be detached.

00:14:37.287 --> 00:14:43.143
For a Guru, there's no brother, sister or any other
relationship except for the relationship of the Mother.

00:14:43.143 --> 00:14:45.876
There is no other relationship.

00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:52.731
One of these principles are to be understood.
Very important, I think, is for all of us,

00:14:52.756 --> 00:14:59.496
that our relationship is only to Mother and
to Sahaja Yogis and not to any relationship

00:14:59.521 --> 00:15:07.084
which has come to us, whether through Sahaja
Yoga or whether through anything else.

00:15:07.084 --> 00:15:13.164
Now this I have been explaining because our Mahalakshmi
tattva is not all right.

00:15:13.164 --> 00:15:18.078
That's why we get, sort of,

00:15:18.078 --> 00:15:23.031
say, frittered away, lost, into  these things.

00:15:23.031 --> 00:15:29.194
And the Mahalakshmi tattva has to be like
an ascending force all put together.

00:15:29.447 --> 00:15:37.775
Like, my father used to give an example. That supposing you have collected lot of wheat

00:15:37.775 --> 00:15:41.920
and you spread it on the ground, it will be all lost.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.473
It will be spread out like this,
this side, that side, it will be all lost.

00:15:45.473 --> 00:15:51.653
But if you put it in a bag, it will rise in
height, naturally. It will have those maryadas.

00:15:51.653 --> 00:15:54.461
It will rise and it will go higher and higher.

00:15:54.461 --> 00:16:00.745
In the same way, this principle of Mahalakshmi
can spread just across like that,

00:16:00.745 --> 00:16:06.816
and can just destroy
all that Mother has given us

00:16:06.943 --> 00:16:12.730
and all that we have had all these years,
only by spreading it outwardly.

00:16:12.787 --> 00:16:18.847
Now to collect it inside, is to pay attention
to yourself. First of all, try to clarify

00:16:18.847 --> 00:16:26.388
your ideas and your
understanding in brain, it's important.

00:16:26.388 --> 00:16:30.042
Because Mahalakshmi tattva ultimately works in the brain.

00:16:30.042 --> 00:16:36.528
It's the enlightenment of the brain, is done by Mahalakshmi
tattva. It gives you the 'sattva', the truth, you see.

00:16:36.528 --> 00:16:45.982
So, in the brain, you must clarify, reach logically.
Logically you must reach the conclusion that,

00:16:45.982 --> 00:16:53.306
"I don't have to do these things,
I have to do these things.

00:16:53.306 --> 00:17:00.404
I have to ascend. This is why I am here.
Why I am here? What am I supposed to do?"

00:17:00.404 --> 00:17:06.309
Now logically you convince your brain,
first of all. It's very important now after Realisation.

00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:13.082
Because if logically your
brain doesn't understand, it will always be cheapish, childish,

00:17:13.082 --> 00:17:20.602
indignified or could be harsh,
horribly oppressive. It could be one of these.

00:17:20.602 --> 00:17:25.517
So, in Guru tattva, there are 10 elements.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:35.345
Five of them deal with the weight. The weight.
Guru is the weight, you see, weight of a person.

00:17:35.892 --> 00:17:40.724
How much weight you have got? The gravity,
as we call it. A person has a gravity.

00:17:40.724 --> 00:17:47.256
When he talks, how much balance he has got. You see
in Indian Music, we call it Vazan, means the weight.

00:17:47.256 --> 00:17:52.094
The weight of the person, means when
he is dealing with himself or with others,

00:17:52.119 --> 00:17:57.929
how much weight he carried. In English also, they
use this word: how much weight he carries with others.

00:17:57.929 --> 00:18:03.903
Means, how much he can
really impress others? If you impress too much  all right,

00:18:03.903 --> 00:18:09.116
then the person will say,
"Oh, it's too much". That is the very big quality

00:18:09.116 --> 00:18:15.889
with Western people is, "Oh, that
is too much!" That, they have an idea, you see.

00:18:15.889 --> 00:18:20.532
This is all ego oriented, "That
is too much". If you tell them too much, "Oh!

00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:23.868
that is too much. She is too much". I do it
slowly, slowly. "It is too much for me!"

00:18:23.868 --> 00:18:30.117
It's very common, it's very common reaction. So, how
much weight you have.

00:18:30.532 --> 00:18:37.078
And the second one is the quality of magnetism.
Two things. Magnetism.

00:18:37.078 --> 00:18:43.390
First is the quality of weight.  That's how much dignified you are,

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:49.864
how you talk. How your language is. How your behaviour is.

00:18:49.864 --> 00:18:57.215
You should be humorous. But sometimes,
even with me, I find people talk in a very funny manner.

00:18:57.215 --> 00:19:02.481
I just don't understand,
how is it that always they say the wrong things?

00:19:02.506 --> 00:19:07.323
I mean, even if they have to say one sentence,
they'll say a wrong thing. It's absolutely with them.

00:19:07.323 --> 00:19:10.630
It is also Vishuddhi, which is also
Nabhi, comes from Nabhi, because you must

00:19:10.655 --> 00:19:15.294
know that Vishuddhi Chakra is the ascent of
the Nabhi Chakra.

00:19:15.319 --> 00:19:21.934
So, what happens, that a person whatever he
is, is expressed through his language,

00:19:21.934 --> 00:19:27.045
through his behaviour, through his face, through his
nose, his eyes, everything, through the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:19:27.045 --> 00:19:31.832
So, the ascent of the Nabhi is expressed,
shown, through the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:19:31.832 --> 00:19:34.825
Now whatever you have in the Nabhi is shown here.

00:19:34.825 --> 00:19:40.511
Supposing now, a person
who has the Mahalakshmi tattva properly developed,

00:19:40.511 --> 00:19:45.426
such a person will have a way of dealing
with another person,

00:19:45.426 --> 00:19:54.260
where he will have the weight as well as the understanding:
how far to go with the person.

00:19:54.430 --> 00:20:02.642
How far to carry on with the person. How far to talk
to a person. How far to think about it.

00:20:02.642 --> 00:20:07.055
How much importance to be given. That's one point,
is very important.

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:13.515
And the another point is that, how much
magnetism you have. So, you reverse back to yourself.

00:20:13.684 --> 00:20:19.345
The magnetism is a magic, is a magic
of a person.

00:20:19.345 --> 00:20:26.746
A person is magnetic because he has certain magic. Now this magic is, comes,
from your own personality.

00:20:26.746 --> 00:20:29.544
From your own personality.

00:20:29.646 --> 00:20:37.283
So, the basis of magnetism, on the left hand side,
is, starts. And that basis is Shri Ganesha.

00:20:37.775 --> 00:20:40.297
Shri Ganesha is the basis of that magnetism.

00:20:40.297 --> 00:20:45.117
So, your innocence. Innocence is the best way
to have that magnetism.

00:20:45.117 --> 00:20:50.480
Magnetism you cannot
express in material way. It's not a material stuff.

00:20:50.505 --> 00:20:58.558
But it is something abstract, comes
from your quality of Ganesha, Shri Ganesha.

00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:05.235
Such a person is magnetic. Magnetic means
that such a person attracts another person

00:21:05.235 --> 00:21:13.092
because of the weight of the person, because of the
quality of the person such a person attracts.

00:21:13.092 --> 00:21:18.479
But does not attract for lust, greed and nonsensical
things.

00:21:18.479 --> 00:21:24.093
But attracts another person because of the fragrance of love in the [unclear].

00:21:24.093 --> 00:21:29.240
Now it is always confused. Confused!. Because it's such an abstract thing.

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:34.482
So, one must understand it in a very subtle way,
what is this magnetism that one should have.

00:21:34.482 --> 00:21:39.328
You see, there are some gestures
people use artificially, which normally they have been using

00:21:39.328 --> 00:21:43.117
just to attract other people,
the way they walk, the way they dress,

00:21:43.117 --> 00:21:46.851
the way they live. All these things
are of no use.

00:21:46.851 --> 00:21:51.569
It is something so inner, that fragrance is so inner which must be developed.

00:21:51.569 --> 00:21:56.267
But in Sahaja Yoga, I have seen people just don't bother about it, just don't bother.

00:21:56.267 --> 00:21:59.778
They think the way they have been living, the way they have been this

00:21:59.778 --> 00:22:03.334
- say, if they are English, they are English.
If they are French, they are French.

00:22:03.334 --> 00:22:08.003
If they are Indians, they are Indians.
If they are from Kolhapur, they'll be from Kolhapur.

00:22:08.245 --> 00:22:13.156
These ideas first must be curbed down,

00:22:13.329 --> 00:22:17.693
because the fragrance spreads everywhere,
whether you are English or anything.

00:22:17.793 --> 00:22:23.519
So, the fragrance of a person develops through,
first of all, the Ganesha principle within you.

00:22:23.993 --> 00:22:27.775
Ganesha principle is to be, first of all, seen to.

00:22:27.775 --> 00:22:34.027
Now a Ganesha person is not a person who is absolutely

00:22:34.027 --> 00:22:40.147
a remorse type or a person
who is such a gone case that

00:22:40.147 --> 00:22:48.275
even if you beat him up and make him into a complete minced
thing, he will bear it.

00:22:48.275 --> 00:22:57.775
It's not that. It's not that. On the contrary, the quality
of magnetism is such that it attracts you to a point

00:22:57.775 --> 00:23:00.895
where you are not disturbed.

00:23:01.256 --> 00:23:03.897
Now this is a very important point
we should know.

00:23:03.897 --> 00:23:09.729
You see, if you have other love like
carnal love and all other love you have,

00:23:09.729 --> 00:23:14.454
then that love, you may attract the person. That
person can destroy you.

00:23:14.454 --> 00:23:17.413
And it destroys you, always.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:22.949
But this attraction does not destroy,
does not destroy anything.

00:23:23.202 --> 00:23:29.728
The attraction is up to that point that you are not destroyed,  because you being much higher,

00:23:29.728 --> 00:23:35.962
much deeper and much weightier,  you cannot be destroyed by a thing that you are attracted.

00:23:35.962 --> 00:23:40.383
Always the greater magnet attracts the smaller magnet.

00:23:40.383 --> 00:23:49.750
And that is what one should understand: this magic
and this charisma this charismatic temperament of a person

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:54.777
comes by, first of all, the Ganesh tattva, innocence.

00:23:55.175 --> 00:24:01.016
And secondly, by complete
dedication and devotion.

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:10.945
Those who are completely dedicated and devoted
to Mother, not to anything else - Ganesha tattva again!

00:24:10.945 --> 00:24:18.870
Not to your wife, not to your husband, not to your sister,
not to your country, not to anyone but to Mother.

00:24:19.189 --> 00:24:29.299
Complete dedication gives you that charisma,
or that attraction.

00:24:29.603 --> 00:24:35.931
In Sahaja Yoga, such a person becomes really
attractive and such a person has it in him.

00:24:35.970 --> 00:24:41.634
Now some people think that if you are [Hindi] -

00:24:47.359 --> 00:24:57.507
Some people think that if you are a very passive
person and if anybody says anything to you

00:24:57.507 --> 00:25:04.596
and you don't mind, sort of a person, you are
charismatic. It is not.

00:25:04.596 --> 00:25:08.286
People like you because they can dominate you.

00:25:08.756 --> 00:25:12.341
They like you because
they can dominate you.

00:25:12.656 --> 00:25:19.119
Now if you think that by your aggressiveness and by
your shouting and by your screaming at these people,

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:25.336
you will achieve that charismatic temperament,
you cannot.

00:25:25.336 --> 00:25:29.330
You cannot achieve that height.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:34.868
So, how do you achieve it?
By becoming more innocent.

00:25:35.121 --> 00:25:40.345
Now how innocence develops in a person? It's
by not thinking about it.

00:25:40.345 --> 00:25:45.593
Like, you see, somebody asked me,
"How do you manage your Income Tax?"

00:25:45.777 --> 00:25:49.341
I said, "By having no income at all".

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:54.485
Then they asked me, "How do you solve your car
problem?" "By not having any car at all of mine".

00:25:54.485 --> 00:25:57.775
They said, "What about your house problem?"
"By having no house of my own."

00:25:57.775 --> 00:26:01.590
"Nihi, Nihi." Everything 'nihi' for me.

00:26:01.778 --> 00:26:05.321
They say, "How do you solve this problem?" "By not having it".

00:26:05.321 --> 00:26:09.483
Just have. "No, not have it!"
Don't take up headaches upon yourself.

00:26:10.221 --> 00:26:15.741
You see, when you take up headaches upon yourself
then only the innocence is reduced.

00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:23.428
That headaches like this, that, "This is my shawl, this is
my sari, this is my thing, this is this, this is this, this is this".

00:26:23.428 --> 00:26:30.891
But only one thing is that, "This is my Mother
and I have to proclaim Her", that's all.

00:26:33.983 --> 00:26:42.542
If that is the way it is, then innocence
starts rising like Shri Ganesha.

00:26:42.542 --> 00:26:48.522
And by having no other headaches,
"This is mine, that is mine."

00:26:48.547 --> 00:26:53.700
This 'mine' business causes the problem, I
think. Personally, I think this must be the reason.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.775
That this 'mine' business. 'This is
mine.' Because whatever is 'mine'.

00:26:57.991 --> 00:27:05.153
See, somebody told me, this is very good argument he gave me,
"Whatever is mine is not I", means that is not sahaj.

00:27:05.153 --> 00:27:10.830
My body, my head, my everything, 'my'. But 'I' He gave me this idea: 'I'.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:18.300
What is 'I'? Then 'I' is separated. Whatever
is not mine is 'I'. So what remains is your Spirit".

00:27:19.237 --> 00:27:22.974
Somebody gave me this argument. I
said, "It's a very good argument to work it out".

00:27:22.974 --> 00:27:32.654
Then whatever remains is the 'I'.  And that
'I' is the one we have to seek. So, you go on

00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:38.725
reducing all these 'mines', 'mines', 'mines'.
So the pure spirit of innocence will rise.

00:27:39.256 --> 00:27:45.207
So the idea about Spirit also, people think
that if you become spiritual --

00:27:45.485 --> 00:27:49.726
I mean, I don't know what people think about spiritual
people.

00:27:49.726 --> 00:27:56.262
But the idea about spiritual people is that you have to
be something terrific like a bull or I don't know.

00:27:56.529 --> 00:28:06.945
You have to be sharp like a fox or you have to be
intellectual like Freud or something.

00:28:07.115 --> 00:28:15.925
All sorts of ideas people have. No, it is not! Spiritual person
is just innocent, just innocent.

00:28:16.312 --> 00:28:21.386
There is no intelligence, nothing. Just innocent. The
whole thing is innocence.

00:28:21.603 --> 00:28:26.903
See, whatever he talks or says, comes through innocence. It
doesn't have intellect as such,

00:28:27.554 --> 00:28:33.278
which you people have through reading and through understanding
and by analysing.

00:28:33.423 --> 00:28:37.717
Nothing of the kind. It just has pure and simple innocence.

00:28:38.028 --> 00:28:42.450
And it all works out very well.
It is so clean.

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:50.933
It just says what it knows and what it knows
is the highest.

00:28:52.269 --> 00:28:57.449
So, this deconditioning has to be brought within
us.

00:28:57.449 --> 00:29:01.250
But you should not discuss it among yourselves also.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:09.425
Once you start discussing then you also,
you see, it becomes sort of a theological argumentation.

00:29:09.425 --> 00:29:13.667
There is no theology about it.
It's very simple. It's the simplest thing

00:29:13.721 --> 00:29:21.620
He is to be innocent. But the innocence is lost.
Why? Because our attention is in different ways.

00:29:21.645 --> 00:29:27.437
We are attentive to other things. We are looking
at other things, you see. It's so simple you know.

00:29:27.775 --> 00:29:32.747
Today, I was thinking I have to buy 3 nine-yard saris.
It's a simple question I tell you.

00:29:32.747 --> 00:29:37.475
Because there were three ladies who
wear nine-yard saris, and I had to give them

00:29:37.475 --> 00:29:42.042
3 nine yard saris. That is all. I just thought of it,
"All right". I came here, I saw very nice saris being put here.

00:29:42.042 --> 00:29:45.133
So, I asked her, "Where do you get these?" She said, "You get here". I said, "All right.

00:29:45.133 --> 00:29:50.050
So you go and buy those three saris". Finished!
No analysis, nothing of the kind.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:53.455
It just came into my mind that
I have to buy three saris. Finished! The answer is here.

00:29:53.621 --> 00:29:59.503
So, even the atmosphere is so innocent,
the whole situation is so innocent

00:29:59.503 --> 00:30:05.247
that the solution is presented by innocence to innocence.
Innocence works out in everything, you see,

00:30:05.247 --> 00:30:09.026
because everybody has little bit of innocence
in every one, isn't it?

00:30:09.243 --> 00:30:15.202
So you can- it's like a fifth column, you see.

00:30:15.202 --> 00:30:20.746
The innocence is a fifth column within you.
So if any person is innocent, you see,

00:30:20.746 --> 00:30:24.839
he'll work on your fifth column
and will make you all right.

00:30:24.839 --> 00:30:30.836
When you give bandhan to others, what happens, you
actually bind him by your innocence.

00:30:30.836 --> 00:30:37.811
And the poor fellow doesn't know. He has his innocence
within him, you capture that innocence, that's how you are there.

00:30:38.078 --> 00:30:42.316
That's how you manage.
It's very simple to work out things.

00:30:42.316 --> 00:30:52.480
Only principle, the tattva, the whole thing rests
on what? Tattva is nothing but innocence.

00:30:53.183 --> 00:30:58.643
So, try to develop this by all these things,
"Ya neti, neti wachane nigamor awachus".

00:30:58.643 --> 00:31:03.763
By saying, "Not this, not this, not this, not
this, not this," to all your thoughts.

00:31:03.763 --> 00:31:08.313
"Not this not this, not this, not this". You reach
there.

00:31:08.313 --> 00:31:13.078
"Not mine, not mine, not mine, not mine". You reach there.

00:31:14.393 --> 00:31:22.836
And that is how it is. And you see the whole
material world is now attacking the innocence,

00:31:22.836 --> 00:31:26.436
because they are frightened.

00:31:26.436 --> 00:31:30.697
You cannot attack, innocence cannot be destroyed. It cannot be destroyed.

00:31:30.697 --> 00:31:36.895
Innocence is something, is all pervading and it cannot be destroyed.

00:31:36.895 --> 00:31:41.213
So, whatever people may try,
it cannot be destroyed. But it can be covered,

00:31:41.213 --> 00:31:48.142
it can recede, but it cannot be
destroyed. It will act its own way.

00:31:48.384 --> 00:31:54.023
So, try to develop that innocence which is the basis
of Mahalakshmi tattva,

00:31:54.349 --> 00:31:58.747
we should say, or that is essence of Mahalakshmi tattva.

00:31:58.747 --> 00:32:04.408
So, the outward thing is the weightage, the weight, the dignity, the behaviour everything.

00:32:04.408 --> 00:32:11.641
It is outward thing. And the inside thing, the tattva,
the principle, on which it is based is innocence.

00:32:11.814 --> 00:32:19.581
Now if it is this, if we understand Mahalakshmi
tattva within us, how it has to work out,

00:32:19.606 --> 00:32:25.868
It's not intellectual! Again I would say that I don't want you
to project your intellect into it and to find out.

00:32:25.868 --> 00:32:33.562
But just remain where you are  and you will find
the answers just coming to you automatically.

00:32:34.032 --> 00:32:39.426
Just don't project your minds into it. Just you'll get
answers to every question, just like that.

00:32:39.426 --> 00:32:43.778
Because innocence in everyone is the simple answer

00:32:43.778 --> 00:32:48.948
when all the complications
drop out, the innocence is there.

00:32:48.948 --> 00:32:54.267
And that is what is the love of God, is the love of
God.

00:32:54.407 --> 00:33:03.184
So, don't confuse this with love, with all your nonsensical love,
ideas you have about people and misidentification.

00:33:03.184 --> 00:33:08.803
This is pure love within us, the purity,
the innocence which is love,

00:33:08.803 --> 00:33:16.813
and which is life itself, we should say.
It is a part of that, it's the Pranashakti

00:33:16.813 --> 00:33:19.877
But Pranashakti is not Mahalakshmi.

00:33:19.877 --> 00:33:25.763
So, Mahalakshmi is the essence and essence
of everything.

00:33:26.482 --> 00:33:34.320
Because if creation has to take place, also, if desire of God is
there, and if there is no Mahalakshmi tattva,

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:39.855
then what is the use of having the desire? It's fiished.
Supposing, even if you have creation,

00:33:39.855 --> 00:33:45.676
and you do not have the Mahalakshmi tattva, how
will you work it out? You cannot work it out.

00:33:45.676 --> 00:33:49.263
You have to have Mahalakshmi tattva. Because
they do not have any meaning.

00:33:49.263 --> 00:33:56.391
So, outwardly it is Mahalakshmi tattva, but
inside is, inside is - we can say, there are 3 cores.

00:33:56.391 --> 00:34:01.429
The first core is Mahalakshmi tattva,
outside to look at, you see the growth, all right.

00:34:01.454 --> 00:34:09.071
Then inside is the creation, that is
all the elements being created and all that.

00:34:09.133 --> 00:34:16.371
But inside that is the desire and inside the
desire is the half one (egg),

00:34:16.371 --> 00:34:22.259
you can say, is the Ganesha. (Before our era)

00:34:22.259 --> 00:34:28.883
So this Ganesha tattwa ultimately overpowers
in everything and permeates through everything.

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:38.680
And this is, I would say that, don't think
about it. Just allow your innocence to grow,

00:34:38.774 --> 00:34:42.992
Simple innocence and your dignity.

00:34:42.992 --> 00:34:48.550
That's very important to have your dignity.
Like some people think if they wear torn clothes,

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:53.662
and walk about on the street, and all they are big sanyasis. It's wrong.

00:34:53.662 --> 00:35:00.288
Why? You are not being dignified and God has given
you so much,  why should you try to show

00:35:00.288 --> 00:35:04.523
that you haven't got anything? Just to show off that you haven't got anything

00:35:04.523 --> 00:35:09.460
God has given. This is just a sort of thanks-giving to God

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:13.494
that, "God you have given me so much."
You have to wear the best.

00:35:13.494 --> 00:35:20.480
Like in puja, if you see, the ladies here wear all their nose
rings and all their ornaments

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.910
and everything, in the temple if they have to go,
everything they wear.

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:28.277
And in the same way, men also wear their very clean
dresses, very clean things, whatever they have.

00:35:28.277 --> 00:35:33.541
They wear simple, clean dresses, whatever they have. But no ostentation.

00:35:33.541 --> 00:35:41.594
It is just a thing by which you express. The God has given you this, "O God, I thank you".

00:35:42.354 --> 00:35:50.228
It is such a great day today to be the New Year, on the New Year day to be here,

00:35:50.228 --> 00:35:54.953
on Mahalakshmi's place of Kolhapur.

00:35:54.953 --> 00:36:02.779
And this is also called Kolhapur because Kolhasura
was killed here.

00:36:03.177 --> 00:36:09.045
Kolhasura was a horrible fellow like a fox and he was
born again. Now he is again dead. Thank God!

00:36:09.045 --> 00:36:12.838
He was here and now he is dead. Kolhasura died.

00:36:12.838 --> 00:36:16.488
You don't think about it, again your mind goes out. Don't think about it,

00:36:16.488 --> 00:36:19.257
I will tell you about it.
I have deliberately avoided the name.

00:36:19.257 --> 00:36:21.929
He was born again and was finished now.

00:36:21.929 --> 00:36:25.740
So, this is the place where Kolhasura was killed,

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:30.207
where this was established, so
Mahalakshmi's incarnation came in.

00:36:30.423 --> 00:36:36.830
And that is how this place has a special value, that we
have come here for a pilgrimage

00:36:37.047 --> 00:36:41.841
and let us be in a humble way, think about it.

00:36:42.656 --> 00:36:48.586
Actually, these things could not take place in the West because
even if they had come out of the Mother Earth,

00:36:48.586 --> 00:36:52.600
who would have recognised them? Who would have known about them?

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:58.251
Who would have respected them?
Who would have worshipped them?

00:36:58.251 --> 00:37:05.431
That is why it did not happen in the West too much.
But it is there, little bit is there, no doubt.

00:37:05.456 --> 00:37:13.282
But here now we have
these, all these, temples

00:37:13.282 --> 00:37:23.132
and the attack on the innocence has come from tantrikas. And
so the tantrikas entered all these temples,

00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:29.160
and they tried to establish themselves. But
gradually, they are being neutralised and cleaned out.

00:37:29.305 --> 00:37:36.589
These tantrikas have gone into every temple of all  the
Goddesses. And they will be gradually all out, straight out.

00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:41.873
So, this is the attack that came through and that's how these brahmins, you see,

00:37:41.873 --> 00:37:45.893
came down and settled
in these places - so-called brahmins.

00:37:45.893 --> 00:37:52.658
And tried to preach about all tantrik methods and things
here, in the temple,

00:37:52.658 --> 00:37:57.507
and they really spoiled the atmosphere here.

00:37:58.194 --> 00:38:00.858
So, may God bless you all.

00:38:01.753 --> 00:38:18.643
I want you people to develop concentration
of mind so that you rise above all other misidentifications

00:38:18.643 --> 00:38:27.981
and get identified with the Pure Spirit, through
your Mahalakshmi principle.

00:38:27.981 --> 00:38:30.255
May God bless you.
