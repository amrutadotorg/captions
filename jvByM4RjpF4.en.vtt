00:00:05.075 --> 00:00:11.487
The mind about which we speak and depend upon is a

00:00:11.707 --> 00:00:20.596
myth. There’s nothing like mind. Brain is
reality, not the mind. Mind is created by

00:00:20.717 --> 00:00:31.144
us reacting to outside, either we react to
conditionings or ego. Thus this mind is created

00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:39.377
like bubbles in the ocean of reality, but
that’s not reality.

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:53.315
This mind, whatever we decide, we know, is
very limited, illusive and sometimes shocking.

00:00:53.647 --> 00:01:00.647
The mind always move in a linear direction,
and because there’s no reality in it, it

00:01:00.732 --> 00:01:13.676
recoils, and boomerangs. Thus all the enterprises,
all the projections so far we have done, it

00:01:13.797 --> 00:01:20.797
seems, come back to us. Whatever they discover,
comes back to us as a big destructive power

00:01:24.347 --> 00:01:28.477
or a very big shock.

00:01:28.477 --> 00:01:35.477
So one has to decide what to do, how to be
out of this trap of our mind. Kundalini is

00:01:40.107 --> 00:01:47.107
the solution. When She’s awakened, She takes
you, with that awakening, She takes you beyond

00:01:47.677 --> 00:01:54.677
your mind. The first thing is to go beyond
your mind. With mind, you’ll do many things,

00:01:55.737 --> 00:02:01.967
but it will not be satisfying, it will be
not a solution, it will not help you. And

00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:07.897
when we start depending too much on our mind
we develop all kinds of physical, mental,

00:02:07.897 --> 00:02:14.897
emotional problem. Now the latest is the stress,
and this stress has no solution they say,

00:02:15.087 --> 00:02:22.087
but in Sahaja Yoga, we find the solution,
by crossing over this mind. It’s like a

00:02:26.706 --> 00:02:31.727
barrier for our advancement.

00:02:31.727 --> 00:02:38.727
So when you get your realisation, you must
understand that your Kundalini has taken your

00:02:39.907 --> 00:02:46.907
attention beyond the mind. Now, this reaction
to outside has come because we human beings

00:02:49.027 --> 00:02:56.027
have a prism-like brain, or we can say a prism-like
skull, and when the energy passes into it,

00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:04.837
I’ve explained it in My books, it goes into
bifurcations, or you can say refractions,

00:03:04.837 --> 00:03:09.326
by which our attention goes out, and we react.

00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:16.326
If we react too much, then these bubbles create
a very horrible mind which can lead to any

00:03:18.487 --> 00:03:25.487
kind of thing. It justifies itself, it pampers
your ego. The ego and the conditioning that

00:03:29.837 --> 00:03:36.837
creates this mind start using this mind for
the purpose of their fulfilment, of their,

00:03:42.266 --> 00:03:49.266
all the accumulation of ideas and thoughts
which has no backing, which has no reality

00:03:54.607 --> 00:03:56.597
with it.

00:03:56.597 --> 00:04:03.597
It’s like we make the computer [and] ultimately
we become slaves of the computer, we make

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:11.407
the watches ourselves, and then we become
slaves of the watches. That’s how it dominates

00:04:11.407 --> 00:04:18.407
human beings. And when a person who has a
very strong mind decides to destroy, like

00:04:21.717 --> 00:04:28.717
Hitler did, with some idea, he can go on destroying
which has a very far fetched effect on our

00:04:30.506 --> 00:04:33.407
culture, on our spirituality.

00:04:33.407 --> 00:04:40.407
Now the first step is to become thoughtlessly
aware – where you cross your mind, you go

00:04:43.386 --> 00:04:50.386
above your mind, mind cannot affect you. This
is the first stage as we call, is thoughtless

00:04:50.427 --> 00:04:51.157
awareness.

00:04:51.157 --> 00:04:58.157
Second one is where you start seeing the working
of this Paramchaitanya, of this All-pervading

00:04:58.917 --> 00:05:05.917
Power. And you start becoming aware that there
is lot of truth in what Mataji says. That

00:05:11.547 --> 00:05:18.547
there is this Power that works out many things.
It works miraculously so many things for you.

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:26.766
It gives you blessings, It guides you, It
helps you in so many ways It helps you. It

00:05:27.886 --> 00:05:34.886
gives you good health, good wealth, and also
a very good society of very beautiful people

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:43.436
in the collective. All that you can see clearly
is happening here.

00:05:43.706 --> 00:05:50.706
Now this happening of achieving thoughtless
awareness is very simple and easy, but to

00:06:05.807 --> 00:06:12.807
maintain at that point is difficult. We still
react and we think. Anything you see, you

00:06:15.566 --> 00:06:22.566
react. To get to that point in thoughtless
awareness is first to change your attention.

00:06:26.657 --> 00:06:33.657
Now, for example, once we were climbing a
very high mountain to see one temple called

00:06:36.057 --> 00:06:43.057
Palitana – Myself, My son-in-law and My
daughter. And we were really tired because

00:06:43.837 --> 00:06:49.087
we had to climb, I don’t know how many steps
and when we went up we were tired and there

00:06:49.087 --> 00:06:55.977
was a little canopy made of beautiful marble
carving, so we just lay down there ourselves.

00:06:55.977 --> 00:07:01.467
They were very tired and they said : “What
is this kind of a temple!” They were grudging.

00:07:01.467 --> 00:07:08.467
While I looked up and I saw lots of beautiful
elephants were carved. So I told My son-in-law,

00:07:11.147 --> 00:07:18.147
“Look at these elephants, they all have
tails of different types.” He said “Mummy,

00:07:18.506 --> 00:07:25.506
we are all dying, how can you see the tails
of elephants?” But is just to divert their

00:07:27.066 --> 00:07:33.446
attention from that tiredness [that] I told
them that – why not see the tails of the

00:07:33.446 --> 00:07:35.696
elephant, which is very different.

00:07:35.696 --> 00:07:42.696
So what happens [is] that, when you are putting
your attention so much to outside all the

00:07:44.897 --> 00:07:51.897
time, then you must first of all also divert
your attention. For example, you see these

00:07:54.717 --> 00:08:00.177
beautifully made things here. Your attention
is something else – just try to enjoy the

00:08:00.177 --> 00:08:05.987
beauty of that. You see. there are beautiful
carpets here – just look at them without

00:08:05.987 --> 00:08:12.066
thinking, because they don’t belong to you,
so no headache, they belong to somebody else,

00:08:12.066 --> 00:08:16.897
is very good! Otherwise, if it belongs to
you you start thinking ; “Oh, My God, I

00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:21.746
have spread them here, what will happen, they
have to be insured!” Or some sort of a thing

00:08:21.746 --> 00:08:26.457
like that. That’s common human reaction.
But if it doesn’t belong to you, you can

00:08:26.457 --> 00:08:33.457
watch it nicely. Now you watch it and don’t
think. You’ll be amazed, when you see the

00:08:33.826 --> 00:08:40.586
beauty that is put inside this, you’ll see
the artist who has put his joy, his exuberance

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:47.586
into it, and you’ll be amazed, after realisation,
that, this exuberance will fill into you and

00:08:49.967 --> 00:08:56.967
a cool kind of a relaxation will come into
you, and this Kundalini will rise, and you’ll

00:08:59.047 --> 00:09:04.787
become steady in your thoughtless awareness.
So whenever you look at anything, look at

00:09:04.787 --> 00:09:11.787
any beautiful thing, even say, today’s election,
just watch the man that is elected. Watching

00:09:16.566 --> 00:09:23.566
him, itself, gives him blessings, gives him
better ideas. You get also ideas, which are

00:09:25.177 --> 00:09:32.177
coming from reality, which are there – how
to make this man a successful person, or this

00:09:33.846 --> 00:09:37.066
country a successful democracy.

00:09:37.066 --> 00:09:44.066
All these things happen when your attention
is diverted from criticising, from reacting

00:09:48.017 --> 00:09:55.017
– just you watch, become the witness, try
to witness everything. It’s not so very

00:09:57.177 --> 00:10:04.177
yet practised, so far, I’ve seen, that,
whenever even we get our, achieve our, realisation,

00:10:04.467 --> 00:10:11.326
we don’t realise that we have to witness
everything. When you start witnessing through

00:10:11.326 --> 00:10:18.326
your Spirit, then you don’t see the bad
points of another, but you see the good points.

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:25.576
You just pick up the person with very good
points.

00:10:25.777 --> 00:10:32.777
So once you see that, the witness state enlarges,
and you start enjoying another person. You

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:42.377
start enjoying every thing that is there,
even a small blade of grass you can enjoy,

00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:45.407
if you have that capacity.
