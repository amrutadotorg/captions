00:00:07.182 --> 00:00:13.202
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:27.722
At the very outset, I have to say we should
know what is the truth.

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:31.462
Everybody is seeking the truth,

00:00:31.542 --> 00:00:37.602
but they have no idea as to what they should find.

00:00:38.542 --> 00:00:42.802
There is an urge within us

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:46.702
because these times are special,

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:49.702
and we are seeking.

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:53.702
But still, we don't have a clear cut idea

00:00:53.782 --> 00:01:03.763
as to what we should seek and 
what we should achieve after our seeking.

00:01:04.782 --> 00:01:18.682
Now I would like to refer to all the
great books on religion, about truth.

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:26.162
They all have said that, 
"You have to know yourself".

00:01:26.322 --> 00:01:34.322
- knowing yourself is the point - and that you
have to become the Spirit.

00:01:35.522 --> 00:01:41.588
It's said in all these religions but though we can find,

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:47.689
that these religions are not really doing that.

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:55.502
 They are not yet able to give you the truth.

00:01:55.942 --> 00:02:00.002
And that is why there is so much of conflict,

00:02:00.082 --> 00:02:02.442
so much of fights going on.

00:02:02.662 --> 00:02:05.242
There are all real religions, no doubt.

00:02:05.322 --> 00:02:08.802
And the essence of every religion is the same.

00:02:08.882 --> 00:02:13.961
Despite all that, they're fighting in the name
of religion.

00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:17.115
How can that be?

00:02:17.582 --> 00:02:30.502
It can be explained very well, that if you have
lost our way, we can go into opposite directions.

00:02:31.382 --> 00:02:35.645
So, when we know we have to know ourselves,

00:02:35.725 --> 00:02:47.600
and that is our goal of life, that is how
we are going to improve on our life as such.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.942
That has been not so clearly explained.

00:02:53.202 --> 00:03:04.262
But, where there is an arrangement within us
or not, is been told by most of them,

00:03:04.342 --> 00:03:08.435
and that arrangement must have been told to you,

00:03:08.515 --> 00:03:18.564
lies in the triangular bone, 3 and a
half coils of energy which is divine,

00:03:18.644 --> 00:03:27.622
which can connect us to the All-pervading Power 
of truth, which is a very subtle energy.

00:03:28.922 --> 00:03:34.682
And when that happens, you get connected with that Power.

00:03:35.242 --> 00:03:39.002
And that Power starts flowing through you.

00:03:39.082 --> 00:03:44.762
And you can feel it on your fingertips that Power flowing.

00:03:45.502 --> 00:03:52.122
This is a fact. We have to first verify before denying it.

00:03:52.202 --> 00:03:56.022
If it could happen to you all,

00:03:56.102 --> 00:04:03.222
that you can feel this All-pervading Power on your fingertips,

00:04:03.302 --> 00:04:07.226
then it's an experience.

00:04:07.458 --> 00:04:11.636
It's, not just by giving you a big lecture

00:04:11.716 --> 00:04:16.822
or telling you about something fantastic, 
but it is actualization.

00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:27.542
Most important thing is the actualization, 
is the becoming of you being the Spirit.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.677
Now, one thing is that you have to

00:04:34.757 --> 00:04:39.340
just take out your shoes or chapals, 
whatever it is,

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.600
because this Mother Earth is of a great help.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.680
She sucks in all of our problems.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.800
Put both the feet apart from each other.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.080
You will know everything about Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.680
why I said, to put your feet apart from each other,

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.560
everything you will know very clearly, 
but they should touch the Mother Earth.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.820
You have to just be comfortable.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.460
And all of you should be seated.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.657
Before I start, I have to request

00:05:29.737 --> 00:05:33.440
that those who want their Realization only 
I can give them.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:41.820
It cannot be forced because Kundalini 
is the pure desire, is the pure desire.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.438
Not impure desire as we have, 
whatever desire we have.

00:05:47.518 --> 00:05:52.840
 We have today one, then we want to have 
something else. That's the principle of economics.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:06:00.160
But this is pure desire and for this pure 
desire you should be determined to get it.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.440
It's your own character, your own 
understanding only will work it out.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:17.164
Now, I would request you all to sit comfortably
with both feet like this, very comfortably.

00:06:17.244 --> 00:06:23.000
And put both your hands, towards me, like this.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:51.820
Now what I find, that some of you feel guilty.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.960
It's a nonsense.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.817
If you feel guilty, then this center
here catches on the left-hand side

00:07:01.897 --> 00:07:04.020
and the Kundalini doesn't move.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.380
So, if you have done anything wrong, I agree.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.000
So, it's finished. That's the past.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.377
You don't have to worry about that.

00:07:16.457 --> 00:07:27.145
At this moment, please, you have to know 
that you are not guilty at all for anything!

00:07:27.225 --> 00:07:30.320
So, please forgive yourself.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.960
Please forgive yourself.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:39.660
Now the second thing is that 
we have to forgive also others.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:46.180
Now, some people say, "It's difficult to forgive, 
Mother". I mean, what do you do?

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:52.540
Whether you forgive or you don't forgive, 
you don't do anything! What do you do?

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:58.260
Nothing. But by not forgiving, you torture
yourself.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.000
So, best thing is to forgive all of them.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:04.193
Forgive everybody who was harmed you,

00:08:04.273 --> 00:08:09.220
who has troubled you, who has made you unhappy, has hurt.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:14.320
Forgive! Don't also think about them. It's also useless.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.640
By forgiving, you don't know what will happen.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.120
Absolutely, you will feel peaceful with yourself.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.613
Just forgive everyone.

00:08:24.693 --> 00:08:31.500
This nobleness you should accept today,
that you forgive everyone. Just forgive.

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:37.900
Now, please put your hands towards me. Like this.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.740
Comfortably, comfortably.

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:52.188
Now you can put your right hand towards me,

00:08:52.268 --> 00:09:00.013
and feel with the left hand on top of 
your fontanelle bone area, little higher,

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:10.720
if there is any cool or a hot breeze, like vibrations, 
are coming out of your own head.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:17.720
On your, say, palm, you can feel it.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:24.493
You move your hand up and down 
and see for yourself if you are feeling.

00:09:24.573 --> 00:09:29.001
Please remove your caps if you have, please. It's better to  remove.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.080
Now, please see.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.600
You must have respect for yourself,

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:42.460
should not denounce yourself and you should 
also forgive everyone. That's, very important.

00:09:42.579 --> 00:09:45.460
Now put the left hand towards me,

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:50.659
and put the right hand on top of your fontanelle bone area,

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.028
and bend your head, just bend your head.

00:09:55.108 --> 00:10:07.420
And see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot
breeze coming out of your own fontanelle bone area.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.740
This is the actualization of the baptism, you may call it.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:21.940
Once more, put your right hand towards me.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.100
And see with your left hand

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:35.267
if there is a cool or a hot breeze
coming out of your fontanelle bone area,

00:10:35.347 --> 00:10:39.800
please keep your head bending.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.320
Now.

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:58.220
If it is hot, means you have not forgiven yourself, 
or you have not forgiven others.

00:10:58.301 --> 00:11:03.602
So again, please forgive. Please
forgive yourself and forgive others.

00:11:03.682 --> 00:11:09.861
That's a very great asset and help.

00:11:18.729 --> 00:11:23.350
Now see for yourself if there's a cool

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:32.205
or a hot breeze coming on your fingertips or on your palms.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:54.140
Please forgive, forgive, forgive yourself and forgive others.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:12:02.140
Very important, because this center here, 
when the crossing of the optic chiasma,

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:07.253
it get obstructed if you have not forgiven, so please forgive.

00:12:07.333 --> 00:12:10.160
Because its a myth not to forgive.

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.500
So, please forgive.

00:12:13.723 --> 00:12:16.085
Hmm.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:30.660
I would say all those who have felt the cool breeze 
in their hands or hot breeze

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:40.320
on their fingertips or on their palm 
or out of their fontanelle bone area,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.460
hot or cool breeze,

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.460
please raise your hands.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:59.524
Mostly all of you have got it.
Mostly.

00:12:59.604 --> 00:13:04.573
May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you all.

00:13:04.653 --> 00:13:06.653
In such a short time, you have got it.

00:13:07.558 --> 00:13:14.560
That means really, we have got very 
wonderful people this time from Los Angeles.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.920
Those who are truly seeker, or real seekers.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.420
May God bless you for that.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:26.660
Now you must respect your Realization, 
and I hope you'll grow into it.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.553
You'll try to grow and become masters.

00:13:29.633 --> 00:13:36.600
Hardly it will take even one month maybe 
to become the masters.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.420
Why not do it?

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.060
All right?

00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.650
May God bless you.
