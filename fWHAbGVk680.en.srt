1
00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:13,476
It has been such a great treat for us,
not only entertainment,

2
00:00:15,066 --> 00:00:23,725
but the way for our future – how to move
and what to do.

3
00:00:23,926 --> 00:00:33,007
It’s very surprising that this Swiss bank
business

4
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:39,742
has been attracting My attention
all the time.

5
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:46,703
I don’t know much, how they can digest
everything so well.

6
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:56,490
In these modern times, when people are
talking of democracy,

7
00:00:56,691 --> 00:01:00,121
talking of very big ideal things and
all that,

8
00:01:00,322 --> 00:01:09,709
at the same time how can such a illegal
system exist openly?

9
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:15,029
And for that I have a plan.

10
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:22,032
As Arneau has said I have to expose, I have
a plan to do something about it.

11
00:01:22,233 --> 00:01:28,182
As far as the materialism is concerned,
it’s working out.

12
00:01:28,383 --> 00:01:35,189
All these countries who were supposed to
be very advanced, developed are suffering;

13
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,146
first from recession – and a terrible
recession.

14
00:01:40,347 --> 00:01:44,146
That recession is going to give them
a lesson

15
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:52,535
about overproduction of nonsensical goods.

16
00:01:52,822 --> 00:02:00,632
Materialism comes because people have
gone mad with their greed.

17
00:02:01,274 --> 00:02:10,171
I was searching a house in England – went
round to see houses, and I was surprised

18
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:15,763
that all kinds of plastic things and mixed
things and all that,

19
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:19,907
were piled up in mountains in every house,
mountains!

20
00:02:20,108 --> 00:02:28,062
And you pass through a door you will find
two legs of a pant falling on you.

21
00:02:28,263 --> 00:02:31,877
But not only in England, same in Paris:

22
00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:37,089
I’ve seen people accumulating so much
of nonsense

23
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,666
that they don’t know where to put it and
what to do.

24
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:46,495
This madness is on and on and on.

25
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:53,176
Now, I have found out a solution for Sahaja
Yogis, what they should do.

26
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:58,032
They should try to encourage handicrafts.

27
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:03,570
Every country I went to, I bought
handicrafts,

28
00:03:03,771 --> 00:03:11,593
whether it was Czechoslovakia or England
or anywhere.

29
00:03:11,794 --> 00:03:18,166
I cannot understand – how can you go
and buy this rubbish of plastic,

30
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:20,867
of these useless things?

31
00:03:21,043 --> 00:03:24,469
And these handicrafts, when I bought,
I was surprised –

32
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:31,734
I must tell you about Czechoslovakia that
there were small, small, very small shops

33
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:36,144
and they all came, one by one, “Mother,
buy something from us also,

34
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:41,285
Mother buy something from us”. You know,
I was surprised, such beautiful things.

35
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:48,953
They said, “We cannot sell them.” But all
nonsensical things people are buying.

36
00:03:49,154 --> 00:03:51,762
So for Sahaja Yogis, they must take a vow

37
00:03:51,963 --> 00:03:55,679
that “we’ll only take things which are
handmade”.

38
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:03,853
You need not have many things, you can
have few, but something handmade.

39
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:10,441
Now, supposing you get a dress, there
should be some handmade embroidery

40
00:04:10,642 --> 00:04:16,854
or something put it on that, so some labor
is put in into that.

41
00:04:18,929 --> 00:04:27,420
It is very difficult to see how people
go in for things

42
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:35,562
which are very cheap and extremely
troublesome.

43
00:04:35,763 --> 00:04:39,003
I must tell you one thing, I can’t wear
nylon,

44
00:04:39,204 --> 00:04:43,324
I can’t wear anything artificial, really,
I can’t.

45
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:48,838
For a while, if I even wear socks also,
My whole body starts paining.

46
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,775
So, it is against you.

47
00:04:51,976 --> 00:05:01,150
Handmade things are few, I agree, but use
as far as possible handmade things.

48
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:06,944
From the Mother Earth they make very nice,
say, terracotta.

49
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:10,805
So, I’m a socialist by temperament,
I think.

50
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:21,542
So, I felt a great urge that I should
really export nothing but terracotta.

51
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:25,837
And terracotta is such a beautiful thing.

52
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:30,778
It’s so soothing, it’s so good – it smells
so well.

53
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:35,129
But people think, “No, we should buy
something that is made

54
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:43,182
from America in some machinery thing.”
They go on buying like that.

55
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:50,013
In America also I was surprised that
beautiful things are selling

56
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:54,924
in shops which they call them as outlets,
very good,

57
00:05:55,202 --> 00:06:04,670
mostly of silk, or of cotton, and leather –
pure leather.

58
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:08,342
But people will go to big, big markets
and buy all nonsense

59
00:06:08,543 --> 00:06:13,705
at a very high price and not from there –
means they have no wisdom.

60
00:06:13,884 --> 00:06:19,708
And this is what happens, that the wisdom,
if it is lacking in your sense,

61
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:25,504
then this wisdom corrodes the society.

62
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:30,837
Because wisdom itself shows

63
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:37,102
how dangerous it is to go on buying all
these nonsensical things.

64
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:42,636
Also now you are seeing that people
are taking now more

65
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:46,813
to Ayurveda and to homeopathy.

66
00:06:47,014 --> 00:06:52,927
They don’t want to use these horrible
medicines produced by your great country.

67
00:06:53,128 --> 00:07:02,161
You know what they do, Swiss? They send
very big offers

68
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:06,212
to doctors from India to come to work
for them.

69
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:10,977
And supposing they have produced one “A”
sample as you’ve shown,

70
00:07:11,178 --> 00:07:15,118
then the same one they change a little bit
(and) say “It’s better”.

71
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,907
And you know these medicines, most of them
are very dangerous and troublesome.

72
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:25,131
By mistake, My family gave Me these
antibiotics.

73
00:07:25,332 --> 00:07:31,082
Since then My legs are very weak and
troublesome – I’ve improved, no doubt.

74
00:07:31,283 --> 00:07:34,912
So, you see, why we are now taking
to this -

75
00:07:35,113 --> 00:07:40,500
because pollution is there another thing,
which is created by this machinery.

76
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:45,398
Gandhiji was saying: “There is no need
to use so much machinery.”

77
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,699
Now, motor cars – we can walk, we can
use trains,

78
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,987
but people want to go anywhere by motor
car, even if it is about, say,

79
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:03,724
ten meters, they don’t want to walk.
That’s how our health has gone down.

80
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:09,683
I must tell you when I was studying in the
school, My school was about five miles.

81
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:17,428
And we had a car, and we had also horses,
and what we call is a buggy in our house.

82
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:22,862
But it was compulsory for us to walk
five miles in the morning.

83
00:08:23,063 --> 00:08:25,648
Evening time the car used to come,

84
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:32,233
but morning time we all had to walk
five miles to go to our school.

85
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:38,291
And in between there was a small, little
mountain which we had to climb.

86
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:45,584
That is how we learnt about nature. If you
don’t walk, from the car what do you know?

87
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:49,815
At the most you can see some lamppost.

88
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:55,797
What do you see from the car? Nothing,
you cannot see the nature.

89
00:08:55,997 --> 00:09:02,861
And this walking system is very much out
of date now for people. People don’t walk.

90
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:10,681
I’m not saying that today we are very
changed, and we are very advanced people.

91
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:15,943
In a way we have gone down because
we cannot walk.

92
00:09:16,144 --> 00:09:20,213
God has given these legs to walk, but
we cannot walk.

93
00:09:20,414 --> 00:09:26,726
We avoid walking. Now, because of that
so many cars.

94
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:33,264
I know that in some families they have
five cars because 5 family members.

95
00:09:33,465 --> 00:09:37,931
Especially in Spain, I was surprised,
so many cars, so many cars

96
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:42,933
and every car has only one person in it
sitting.

97
00:09:43,778 --> 00:09:48,411
Now, problem has started with the pollution
and all these things,

98
00:09:48,612 --> 00:09:55,058
because we have lost the habits
of depending upon ourselves.

99
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:04,359
Now see what has happened in, say,

100
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,856
this Kuala Lumpur and all these places
suffering from what you call, the smoke.

101
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:15,848
Now I have not done it, if you think that
way. And they are praying to Allah,

102
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,102
“Give us water”. Why should God give
them water

103
00:10:19,303 --> 00:10:24,160
when they are doing all kinds of
nonsensical things?

104
00:10:24,882 --> 00:10:29,643
Now, there is smoke going on, why? Because
they have cut the trees.

105
00:10:29,844 --> 00:10:38,118
So, why do they want to cut the trees?
Because they want to make money, that’s all.

106
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:44,123
Their wood is coming to India, because in
India also they have cut the trees.

107
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:48,529
If you go on like this – mad, you will have
pollution, means what?

108
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:54,400
Is that, destructive forces will act
and stop it.

109
00:10:56,197 --> 00:11:00,169
For that you don’t have to pray to
the Goddess, it will work out.

110
00:11:00,346 --> 00:11:03,081
And it’s all working out everywhere.

111
00:11:03,282 --> 00:11:08,590
So, whatever you have to have, try to have
something which is handmade.

112
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:15,858
Even your clothes - need not be many,
try to have it which are handmade -

113
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,600
is one of the things Sahaja Yogis can do.

114
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:26,489
There need not be to send money to this
Swiss Bank also.

115
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,241
This Swiss Bank will be very badly exposed
now,

116
00:11:29,418 --> 00:11:33,196
I’m angry with them for one more thing,
that they had promised that they’ll give

117
00:11:33,397 --> 00:11:37,923
the money to the Jews and now they are
going like this, they don’t want to give.

118
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:42,824
When they will die are they going
to take it with them?

119
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:51,037
All these sins will be punished and that is
why I’m very happy

120
00:11:51,238 --> 00:11:54,088
this he has brought in, because I’ve been
talking about it –

121
00:11:54,289 --> 00:12:00,103
even in that conference I went to in China,
I talked openly about this Swiss Bank.

122
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:06,712
I have talked to many magistrates and
to many, what you call them,

123
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:11,432
the head of the law ministry and all that,
and I’ve told them,

124
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:18,492
“Why not we have a conference and say
that this banking is nonsense”.

125
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:28,815
Now, all types of bad people are taking
advantage of this system

126
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:34,527
and are trying to make money, look very
nice or so, I don’t know.

127
00:12:34,728 --> 00:12:37,074
So many have lost their money there,

128
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:39,806
I don’t know what was the need to put
all this money there.

129
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:44,227
That when they die, their children do not
get anything.

130
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:53,272
But the problem is this greed, is some sort
of a inner defect in a human being.

131
00:12:54,169 --> 00:13:05,181
He becomes greedy, greedy because he has
deviated from dharma.

132
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:12,609
He thinks he can get pleasure out
of things, he cannot.

133
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:18,232
And he goes on accumulating and buying
and this and that.

134
00:13:18,433 --> 00:13:25,495
I would say your Mother also does that.
I buy, but I buy things which are handmade.

135
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:31,715
So that tomorrow, if I have to give it
presents, or if I have to sell off things,

136
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:37,001
even the ornaments you have given Me,
I didn’t know what to do, I’m selling them.

137
00:13:37,202 --> 00:13:46,587
What will I do with the ornaments – I have
to buy so many ashrams, this, that.

138
00:13:46,788 --> 00:13:49,738
My family ornaments also I’m selling,

139
00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:54,332
because I spent money on My family things
also.

140
00:13:54,533 --> 00:14:01,544
Just think of it, what is all this for,
what pleasure does it give us?

141
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,629
I can understand, if you want to give
somebody a present,

142
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:12,463
or somebody you want to give some
happiness, joy – you should do it,

143
00:14:12,664 --> 00:14:19,782
but just for yourself go on, go on, how
much can you digest it? You cannot.

144
00:14:19,983 --> 00:14:23,610
Joy is much more in giving to others.

145
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:32,099
It’s not, it’s not a thing that gives you
any understanding of the fundamentals,

146
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:38,015
and the fundamentals is that you are
dharma.

147
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:45,983
Within you is that, that is your valency,
and this materialism absolutely against it,

148
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:58,631
because it creates all kinds of people:
mafias, this Swiss bank, cheats -

149
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:03,654
we have communities after communities
who are known to be cheats,

150
00:15:03,855 --> 00:15:08,063
who are very materialistic, they have
no spiritual sense.

151
00:15:08,264 --> 00:15:12,847
So for Sahaja Yogis, I would say -
of course you have said all the mantras

152
00:15:13,048 --> 00:15:16,953
so I’m supposed to do all that.
But what you have to do

153
00:15:17,154 --> 00:15:22,509
is not to buy any more anything which is
not handmade. Try it.

154
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,110
At least, there should be some embroidery,

155
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:29,715
at least, there should be some work
done on it.

156
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:34,313
I’m surprised that these things are
not very good for us,

157
00:15:34,514 --> 00:15:37,274
they are injurious to our health.

158
00:15:37,475 --> 00:15:42,614
So Sahaja Yogis must learn that they
have to walk.

159
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:47,622
They must walk and they must see
the nature, what is in the nature.

160
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:53,368
Many of you don’t know what - say, I ask
the name of this flower,

161
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:56,752
how many of you know?

162
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:09,655
It’s a very sweet name, “Kiss Me Quick”,
apart from its botanical name.

163
00:16:09,856 --> 00:16:13,945
But it is, you see, what I’m saying,
everything you should know -

164
00:16:14,146 --> 00:16:21,025
you should know about small, small things,
from where do this embroidery comes?

165
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:24,309
From where does this sari comes?

166
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:30,291
Our Indian men are the worst, I would say,
they don’t know anything whatsoever.

167
00:16:30,492 --> 00:16:34,558
But even western men also have the same
problem.

168
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,817
You must take interest in things in which
you have not taken interest.

169
00:16:39,013 --> 00:16:43,294
For example, Indians don’t know how
to cook, they don’t know!

170
00:16:43,495 --> 00:16:46,741
Once My husband told Me that he knows
how to cook.

171
00:16:46,942 --> 00:16:51,116
I said, “What? He said, “I’ll make
chapatis, rotis.”

172
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:57,512
And what he made was nothing –
Australia, America, this, that.

173
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:05,261
But he said, “I give up because I was doing
shipping, but shipping means shipping.”

174
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:14,448
But minute things you can see, what we
call is a subtle vision, subtle eyesight.

175
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:20,571
If you walk, look at the nature, love
the trees, love the animals.

176
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:24,497
You’ll be amazed, there are so many
things to be known

177
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:28,428
than reading newspaper, what is there
to read in the newspaper?

178
00:17:28,629 --> 00:17:33,884
For hours together you go on reading
newspaper, next day you forget it.

179
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:41,352
You’ll be amazed that they say that
for Goddess it is said that

180
00:17:41,553 --> 00:17:48,263
“Kataksha Kataksha Nirikshana” – every
glance, She knows everything.

181
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:55,331
Any glance She puts on any man, woman
or anything, She knows where it is.

182
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,603
And if you are My children you should
also try that,

183
00:17:58,764 --> 00:18:02,615
because I always used to run out
into jungles, in the forest,

184
00:18:02,816 --> 00:18:09,333
I used to go to all such places and really
enjoy the beautiful Mother,

185
00:18:09,534 --> 00:18:14,561
this Mother Earth who has created such
a beautiful thing.

186
00:18:14,762 --> 00:18:19,905
Have you noticed just now that the colors
of the background

187
00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:26,939
which were made by the Russians and
the colors of this facing thing

188
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:33,421
are just the same, they have used the same
colors. It’s true collectivity.

189
00:18:33,622 --> 00:18:38,929
Now, you notice in the nature it’s so
matching, you know.

190
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,808
Nothing gross, nothing loud – it’s
so beautiful,

191
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:46,071
this is red but it has green to match it.

192
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:49,770
This Mother Earth knows everything,
She understands everything,

193
00:18:49,971 --> 00:18:55,001
She does everything, but what do we do
for Mother Earth? –

194
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:59,589
Is to run after artificial things,
machinery, this thing –

195
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,576
and now a new thing has come, is computer.

196
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,287
It’s all right if you want to write letters
to someone,

197
00:19:07,488 --> 00:19:10,501
but otherwise it’s quite maddening,
you know.

198
00:19:10,702 --> 00:19:14,620
And this computer will make our brain
absolutely zero.

199
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:18,931
We’ll be paralyzed, we won’t be able
to think 2 + 2.

200
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:24,292
So, anything that you want to use also,
should have its maryadas,

201
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:28,111
don’t go beyond it. If you take
to swimming,

202
00:19:28,312 --> 00:19:31,588
you’ll go on swimming till you get sick.

203
00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:37,152
If you are horse-riding, you’ll go on
horse-riding till you fall down.

204
00:19:37,353 --> 00:19:44,015
You see, this is also a kind of a life
which has no maryadas –

205
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:51,149
like greed has no maryadas, that’s how
also this kind of nonsense,

206
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:54,753
“I am only fond of this, I am only
fond of this.”

207
00:19:54,954 --> 00:19:58,370
You are a human being, you should never
say like that.

208
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:02,639
On the contrary you should say, “I must
learn this, I must know this,

209
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,021
what is this all about?”. It is very
important,

210
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:12,340
otherwise your personality will be a dwarf
personality –

211
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:17,764
and ultimately people end up in money.
I don’t understand.

212
00:20:17,965 --> 00:20:22,010
I can’t even count 200 notes, can’t even.

213
00:20:22,211 --> 00:20:25,969
I don’t know about money, I should say.
But I’m good at mathematics -

214
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,983
but I don’t know, whatever money you are
giving goes direct to them

215
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:32,962
and they do it what they like. Now,
if somebody says,

216
00:20:33,163 --> 00:20:36,038
“How much You got for this?”
“I don’t know”.

217
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:42,383
“How much for royalties?” “I don’t know”,
because I’m not interested.

218
00:20:42,584 --> 00:20:47,064
I’m not interested. What is there to be
so much interested in money?

219
00:20:47,265 --> 00:20:53,182
But I get money, all right, no problem,
never a problem.

220
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:56,200
I sold one of My ornaments

221
00:20:56,401 --> 00:21:01,096
and I got at least 100 times more
than what I have spent.

222
00:21:01,296 --> 00:21:05,605
Maybe you might say it’s vibrations,
whatever you may say.

223
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:16,550
So to get after money means you get
very much in the clutches of money.

224
00:21:17,177 --> 00:21:22,660
So what is the solution, to get rid
of this greed?

225
00:21:22,874 --> 00:21:28,316
Is to try and give it to others and see
the joy.

226
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:37,739
Give something to others, share and see
the joy you feel by giving something.

227
00:21:40,046 --> 00:21:43,260
I must tell you, Gregoire is not her
 but I am missing him

228
00:21:43,461 --> 00:21:48,765
because once I went to a sari shop
and wanted to buy one sari

229
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:51,445
but I thought “It’s rather expensive,

230
00:21:51,646 --> 00:21:57,269
why should I buy such an expensive sari”,
came away.

231
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:03,447
And you’ll be amazed, he gave Me the same
sari on My birthday

232
00:22:03,648 --> 00:22:08,159
and I was so filled with joy, because
he bought it next day,

233
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:14,611
went and bought it from that shop, kept it
with him and on My birthday he gave Me.

234
00:22:17,012 --> 00:22:20,684
These small, small things can give you
great joy

235
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:26,765
in giving people, other people,
not yourself.

236
00:22:26,966 --> 00:22:31,548
I don’t know if I have bought anything
much for Myself in My lifetime, never.

237
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:34,030
Even if I go out shopping, even if
I am thirsty,

238
00:22:34,231 --> 00:22:38,348
I won’t even buy one Coca-Cola for Myself.

239
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:42,691
People know that I don’t buy anything
for Myself,

240
00:22:42,892 --> 00:22:46,166
practically nothing, but you all give Me
so much, what to do.

241
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:53,550
Now, I have decided that after these
75 years of age,

242
00:22:53,751 --> 00:22:57,480
I shouldn’t take anything from you
whatsoever.

243
00:22:57,681 --> 00:23:00,384
But to please you maybe, they are asking
that,

244
00:23:00,585 --> 00:23:05,256
“Only take a national, international”,
all right. But no more,

245
00:23:05,457 --> 00:23:10,186
every country shouldn’t bring. What
after all this national, international –

246
00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:15,739
you are all international people, what is
the need to bring any present for Me?

247
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,101
I don’t even have time to see them.

248
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:27,657
I’m so very busy with other things, because
there are so many problems in this world.

249
00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:31,584
So, I would suggest that, to get over
all these things

250
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:35,766
we should see ourselves, what we are
doing about it.

251
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:40,352
I’m sure none of you have money
in the Swiss Bank, thank God.

252
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:46,654
But never earn more than what you can –
you have, there’s no need.

253
00:23:46,855 --> 00:23:51,528
Whatever comes your way is all right.
Of course if you are doing some work

254
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:58,927
of creativity, of creating some designs,
creating something is all right.

255
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:03,575
But don’t buy things, go on buying things
for yourself

256
00:24:03,776 --> 00:24:11,719
or putting then money here, hiding, hiding
there, there’s no need.

257
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:17,622
You see, you’ll feel so satisfied and
so happy being honest,

258
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:25,487
being absolutely beyond any problem.

259
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:31,373
Now this mafia business is there, I agree
with you. Now this mafia can be controlled

260
00:24:31,574 --> 00:24:37,380
only by the government because they give
such a big tax.

261
00:24:37,581 --> 00:24:41,288
Now I mean, for example, an artisan
in this poor country -

262
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:46,210
I will say poor because most of the people
are suffering from tax –

263
00:24:46,411 --> 00:24:52,666
you see, he has to pay 265 types of taxes.

264
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:58,611
Italians are known for their art, they make
beautiful things,

265
00:24:58,812 --> 00:25:03,014
but they cannot because they have to pay
so much taxation.

266
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:06,353
Only the designers they make the money.

267
00:25:06,553 --> 00:25:11,417
Designers make the money befooling
everybody.

268
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:20,840
They befool people so much. Once My husband
went to Cairo and bought one scarf for Me.

269
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:24,694
So, he said, “This is designer’s.”

270
00:25:24,895 --> 00:25:29,988
I said, “This looks Indian to me, this is
an Indian thing.”

271
00:25:30,189 --> 00:25:35,419
And surprisingly in the corner it was
written “Made in India”.

272
00:25:36,499 --> 00:25:43,515
He paid £25 for that, in India you can
get it for £2.

273
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:48,973
So, this is another thing is to run a race
of eliteness.

274
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:53,165
You see this one was bought by
My son-in-law.

275
00:25:53,366 --> 00:25:58,356
I said: “What is so special?”
He said, “It’s very great, you know.”

276
00:25:58,564 --> 00:26:02,326
I didn’t know what was so special about
those spectacles.

277
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:08,751
So, I went to one shop in America

278
00:26:08,952 --> 00:26:11,936
and they all started saying, “Madam,
Madam, Madam …”.

279
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:16,714
I said, “What is so Madam about Me?.
Why are they calling Me ‘Madam’?”

280
00:26:16,915 --> 00:26:23,451
“Oh, You don’t know?” - they said - “This
is Cartier.” I said, “Who is this Cartier?”

281
00:26:23,652 --> 00:26:28,165
So I’m going to put Kartikeya against him!

282
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:38,322
All such stupid ideas, you see, and then
they bought Me a…

283
00:26:38,523 --> 00:26:47,031
[Aside: “What you call that? The watch was…
what was that watch? Ah, Patek Philippe!] -

284
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:51,889
Patek Philippe, that watch they brought
for Me

285
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:56,719
and it would not run in time. I said,
“What is this?

286
00:26:57,354 --> 00:27:01,774
Never keeps the time, it’s always
out of time.

287
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,506
My vibrations must be trying some tricks”.

288
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:09,472
So I gave it to one of them, I said, “Baba,
show this to the Patek Phillips.”

289
00:27:09,758 --> 00:27:13,753
Ah, that day Mathias was here. “This
will hit their ego, Mother, very much”.

290
00:27:13,954 --> 00:27:17,899
I said, “Why?” “Because they think
they are the best.”

291
00:27:18,566 --> 00:27:22,728
I said, “Whatever it is, tell them you
change it, it doesn’t keep to time.”

292
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:26,449
Then I asked My daughter to have it,
I said, “Baba, I can’t make …

293
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:31,015
I don’t know why, maybe I will have
something simple, it’s better.”

294
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:37,379
That too again turned out to be a,
what you call? ‘Designers’.

295
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:42,250
They are now all - most of these designers
are in jail.

296
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:47,523
And some of them met Me when I was
coming from Russia.

297
00:27:47,724 --> 00:27:52,211
They are absolutely useless people,
you know.

298
00:27:52,412 --> 00:27:55,132
They take out some idea and sell it
for a high price

299
00:27:55,341 --> 00:28:03,995
and if you are a fool you go and buy that.
Did you notice that this is Cartier?

300
00:28:06,428 --> 00:28:12,226
For Sahaja Yogis are simple people. Now
this is the thing is that there are,

301
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,684
these are also mafias, I tell you, these
are also mafias.

302
00:28:15,885 --> 00:28:19,830
And these mafias are exploiting you,
I’ve written it in My book also,

303
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:24,444
if you read it, how these entrepreneurs
are trying to befool you.

304
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:31,483
You wear simple dress, simple from
handmade – will be much better

305
00:28:31,684 --> 00:28:37,913
than to wear something that makes you
look like something out of the blue.

306
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:44,084
And there is no need because it is just
satisfying your ego.

307
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:53,839
Some people have a habit – as soon as –
say, I have, supposing some dinner set,

308
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:58,605
may not be good or… - they’ll come and see
the back of the dinner plate.

309
00:28:58,806 --> 00:29:03,519
“Ah, from where did You get it?” –
“I don’t know.” “You don’t know?”

310
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,691
“No, no, this was, I think, I think somebody
gave Me, I don’t know, I don’t know.”

311
00:29:07,905 --> 00:29:10,648
“No, no, You better find out, because
very nice.”

312
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:13,937
Next day they’ll go round the whole place
to find out

313
00:29:14,138 --> 00:29:17,918
if they can get the same dinner set.

314
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:22,541
And Sahaja Yoga is just the opposite.
I tell you, you depend on Sahaja Yoga.

315
00:29:22,742 --> 00:29:32,303
Once My husband liked one tea set. So
you know London has huge, big stores.

316
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:36,355
Some of them are really horrid.
I went there –

317
00:29:36,556 --> 00:29:40,591
baarpre baap - we walked and walked
and walked through so many.

318
00:29:40,792 --> 00:29:44,577
They said, “All right, we promise after
6 months.” Another said, “7 months”,

319
00:29:44,778 --> 00:29:52,173
another said, “8 months, you give us
the order.” So I gave up the idea.

320
00:29:52,461 --> 00:29:55,162
Then C.P. said, “What has happened
to their factories?”

321
00:29:55,392 --> 00:29:58,195
I said, “They don’t have anything, they
are exporting.”

322
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:05,359
Then I went to Australia, you’ll be amazed
- and there for a special price,

323
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:11,481
just for propagating, they had put
these tea sets there.

324
00:30:12,203 --> 00:30:17,749
Imagine, in Australia, and I got it
for the half price.

325
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:24,470
So, if you don’t have greed you get
what you want just there.

326
00:30:26,797 --> 00:30:30,158
Just there you get it.

327
00:30:31,112 --> 00:30:36,592
But if you have greed, then God makes
you dance. All right?

328
00:30:36,802 --> 00:30:41,274
That is what is so simple as that -
whatever you want you can get it,

329
00:30:41,475 --> 00:30:44,991
if you don’t have greed about it.

330
00:30:45,198 --> 00:30:50,980
That’s such an enslaving thing within us,
that we have greed.

331
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:57,686
I mean I can give you 1,001 examples
of that, 1,001.

332
00:30:57,887 --> 00:31:03,844
That if you don’t ask for anything, if you
don’t desire for anything,

333
00:31:04,045 --> 00:31:10,138
you get what you need, whatever you need
you get.

334
00:31:10,797 --> 00:31:18,052
But if you go on desiring, then go mad
after it. Go there, get this and get lost.

335
00:31:18,424 --> 00:31:21,893
And then the thing also gets lost.

336
00:31:22,094 --> 00:31:29,341
That’s why it is said, better try
to develop a detachment.

337
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,704
It’s all right, if it is there well and
good, if it is not there, doesn’t matter.

338
00:31:35,957 --> 00:31:39,668
Then you’ll be surprised your attention
will be so subtle.

339
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:45,841
Now none of you I think have seen these
beautiful flowers, what are there.

340
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:51,641
The beautiful embroidery that is there.
The way they have done this.

341
00:31:51,842 --> 00:31:56,941
Now can you tell Me how many there are,
hands in this work –

342
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:08,788
14, 28. This side 14, this side 14.

343
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:20,513
I mean, inclusive of all these other
things.

344
00:32:21,978 --> 00:32:27,830
So you don’t notice anything and your
attention becomes…

345
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:32,651
“Mahamaya” - they say has been - “it has
been the Mahamaya”. This is no explanation.

346
00:32:32,852 --> 00:32:39,654
Your attention if it is clear, is simple,
you can see the thing clearly.

347
00:32:41,296 --> 00:32:46,621
And with that attention only, that
attention yourself

348
00:32:47,505 --> 00:32:50,094
takes you to the right place where you
have to go,

349
00:32:50,295 --> 00:32:54,193
you get the right thing what you want
to buy.

350
00:32:57,499 --> 00:33:01,994
Can you tell Me you see these carpets
are from where?

351
00:33:08,174 --> 00:33:11,520
They are mostly from Russia.

352
00:33:13,232 --> 00:33:21,973
I went to Russia and I saw this carpet
factory. They have no sense of export also.

353
00:33:22,174 --> 00:33:27,218
So I told them that, “How much will
a carpet cost?” - Doctor knows -

354
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:32,842
They said, “Only $20.” I said, “Baba,
$20 for a carpet?”

355
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:36,926
So, I told Doctor, “Now what to do,
we have to buy many”.

356
00:33:37,127 --> 00:33:42,275
I said, “How much for export?” “$200.”

357
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:46,981
I said, “In India the other way round.
If you have to export something,

358
00:33:47,182 --> 00:33:52,497
then the price is less.” I said,
“All right,

359
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:56,632
so I guess we must think of the solution
because I need it.”

360
00:33:56,833 --> 00:34:01,070
So I asked about 20 Sahaja Yogis to go
and buy each one.

361
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:06,513
To Russians they give for $20.
I said, “All right, you bring these.”

362
00:34:07,689 --> 00:34:13,841
So, you should go in for solutions and not
for problems.

363
00:34:14,042 --> 00:34:19,075
Greed is a problem, greed is a problem.

364
00:34:19,276 --> 00:34:22,172
How to get rid of the greed is the point.

365
00:34:22,373 --> 00:34:26,022
And to get rid of the greed is that
if I buy something –

366
00:34:26,223 --> 00:34:31,532
for whom should I buy this one, for whom
should I buy?

367
00:34:31,733 --> 00:34:37,343
Ah, this will be all right for another
friend of mine, like that.

368
00:34:37,544 --> 00:34:44,349
If you train your mind on these lines,
not for yourself, but for others,

369
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:50,554
then you’ll be amazed this greed will run
away and you’ll have joy.

370
00:34:51,348 --> 00:34:55,941
As you want to give Me things, I understand
that, I also want to give you.

371
00:34:56,142 --> 00:35:01,955
In the same way, think of all others,
they are all brothers and sisters.

372
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:07,207
From other countries, make friends
with other countries.

373
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:11,378
If giving is there, then this greed goes
away (indistinct)

374
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:17,232
and you get what you want. It’s a very
simple mantra.

375
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:28,808
It’s surprising, so far, with all
the miracles,

376
00:35:29,009 --> 00:35:33,894
we don’t understand that whatever
we need also be provided for.

377
00:35:34,095 --> 00:35:41,193
But you must need it, not for stupid
collection of things.

378
00:35:42,524 --> 00:35:47,851
This was a very, very good thing, acted
very well, I enjoyed it thoroughly,

379
00:35:48,052 --> 00:35:54,082
this Swiss Bank laundering. I know
My country suffers from it.

380
00:35:54,724 --> 00:35:59,774
Now, the another drama, which was done
by the English,

381
00:35:59,975 --> 00:36:05,980
shows – it’s a – “Pilgrim’s Progress” is
an old, quite an old drama,

382
00:36:06,181 --> 00:36:11,317
which I have read long time back. But this
is the real pilgrims they have shown,

383
00:36:11,518 --> 00:36:16,206
how a seeker goes into wrong ways, methods,

384
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:20,844
and throughout they have very nicely
brought in how even a Sahaja Yogi,

385
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:26,825
while rising, falls into different pits.
So it’s a very good thing for you to know

386
00:36:27,026 --> 00:36:32,439
that if you are Sahaja Yogis, you should be
very careful, and you should see that

387
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:39,677
you don’t fall into these pits and
ultimately the ego and superego.

388
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:48,168
In the west the problem is more of ego,
not of superego. And for ego,

389
00:36:52,986 --> 00:37:00,541
to accept that you have ego is the only
way; and then it will drop out.

390
00:37:00,742 --> 00:37:05,076
If you know there is ego, ego will
drop out.

391
00:37:06,021 --> 00:37:11,160
The simple thing is to know that you have
ego. Ego of something.

392
00:37:11,361 --> 00:37:14,609
People have ego of any nonsense, you know.

393
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:17,989
There was one lady very proud
and egoistical.

394
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:24,294
So I asked about her, “What is the matter
with her?”

395
00:37:24,495 --> 00:37:27,615
“Because she knows how to make dolls” –
Why?

396
00:37:27,816 --> 00:37:31,448
That should give you ego or what?
I didn’t understand that part.

397
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:35,395
But this is what it is, even for small
things people have ego,

398
00:37:35,596 --> 00:37:43,644
and all this designing and all that
is based on your stupid ego

399
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:48,252
which makes you buy all these things
to show off your ego.

400
00:37:48,453 --> 00:37:55,914
So try to be humble – humble and try
to understand

401
00:37:56,115 --> 00:38:01,071
that all these worldly things we are not
going to take them with us.

402
00:38:01,272 --> 00:38:03,958
They are going to lie down here. I am not
saying you renounce.

403
00:38:04,172 --> 00:38:08,104
I’m not saying you take sanyasa, but you
should know that

404
00:38:08,305 --> 00:38:12,112
the value of these things is nothing
compared to you.

405
00:38:12,313 --> 00:38:14,778
When ego comes, this idiocity comes in.

406
00:38:14,979 --> 00:38:21,463
You think by wearing something great
you are very much influencing others.

407
00:38:21,664 --> 00:38:28,797
You may, but those who are influenced
are another set of fools, I must say.

408
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:36,000
Once I was wearing a ring and I went
to shopping in one of the places

409
00:38:36,201 --> 00:38:39,626
and they were so respectful to Me.
I said, “Suddenly the shopkeepers,

410
00:38:39,827 --> 00:38:44,617
they never respect Me because I’m
an Indian – what has happened?”

411
00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:48,867
So I had gone to a shop where the lady
was known to Me.

412
00:38:49,068 --> 00:38:54,896
She said, “May I ask You, is this real?”
I said, “What do you mean, real?”

413
00:38:55,097 --> 00:39:00,552
“Is it a real emerald?” “Yes, yes, very old
from My family.”

414
00:39:00,777 --> 00:39:04,481
“Ah, so Your family very rich?”

415
00:39:04,682 --> 00:39:10,816
“No, no, it was from My forefathers,
I’m just wearing that.”

416
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:16,072
“Oh my God, if it is real, what will be
the price?” I said, “How will I know,

417
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:20,562
it was bought long time back, I don’t know
the price.” “No, can you get me one?”

418
00:39:20,763 --> 00:39:25,007
I said, “Why do you want to have it,
you can have this one if you like.”

419
00:39:25,208 --> 00:39:32,666
Like that, you know, a small thing makes
them so…, that you are so great. It’s not.

420
00:39:32,867 --> 00:39:36,637
What is the greatest thing in us is
our Spirit,

421
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:41,551
is the Spirit that we have and we should
know that we should be proud of it,

422
00:39:41,752 --> 00:39:44,495
that we have got the Spirit within us.

423
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:50,226
And if you become proud, then you will not
do nonsensical things.

424
00:39:50,427 --> 00:39:53,917
You are people who are all realized souls.

425
00:39:54,118 --> 00:39:58,987
And already, you have crossed over this
pilgrims stage, you are much above that.

426
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:03,559
Now the greatest thing is to know that
we are spiritual people

427
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:11,376
and as spiritual people – you even
dominate Me, in a way.

428
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:15,483
If you all desire for something, I can’t
get over it.

429
00:40:15,683 --> 00:40:22,674
I have to accept. I have to keep you
pleased.

430
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:27,538
Many things I’m doing just because
you want it;

431
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:32,822
doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter to Me
because nothing comes over My head.

432
00:40:33,023 --> 00:40:36,227
So it’s all right, whatever children want,
let them do.

433
00:40:36,428 --> 00:40:43,465
But the one point is this ego has to be
really under control.

434
00:40:44,471 --> 00:40:48,076
There’s one little more point I want
to tell you,

435
00:40:48,277 --> 00:40:50,317
because tomorrow I may not be able to say,

436
00:40:50,518 --> 00:40:55,008
in Navaratri, you see, I am bound by other
things, is this –

437
00:40:55,209 --> 00:41:01,356
I wanted to talk to people who are married
in Sahaja Yoga, especially to the ladies.

438
00:41:01,557 --> 00:41:08,566
I think some of them are extremely
dominating and stupid.

439
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:15,078
What is marriage? Marriage is honeymoon
as they call it.

440
00:41:15,279 --> 00:41:20,274
Honey is the essence and moon is the peace.

441
00:41:20,475 --> 00:41:26,607
Now if the women are quarrelsome,
fighting, sarcastic,

442
00:41:26,808 --> 00:41:31,237
it is absolutely a hell for man.

443
00:41:32,563 --> 00:41:38,484
Instead of that, if woman knows
the essence, the honey,

444
00:41:38,685 --> 00:41:44,674
she should know how to please the husband,
to bring peace in the family.

445
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:49,746
Now some of the husbands are drunkards
or anything – not in Sahaja Yoga.

446
00:41:49,891 --> 00:41:53,232
What pleases the husband?

447
00:41:54,744 --> 00:41:58,131
You see, in a way, it’s a trick.

448
00:41:58,332 --> 00:42:04,026
It’s a trick of a realized soul, how
to please others.

449
00:42:04,227 --> 00:42:09,090
What do we do to our husbands?
Do we try to please?

450
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:12,951
First of all find out what he likes.

451
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,646
My husband, I would say - he’s gone away,
thank God -

452
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:20,712
he used to say, “You shouldn’t wear
any flower in your head.”

453
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:25,455
But in Maharashtra all the married women
are supposed to wear flowers.

454
00:42:25,656 --> 00:42:31,151
Since that day I have never worn any flower
in My head.

455
00:42:31,352 --> 00:42:37,023
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, he didn’t
know what I was,

456
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:40,579
so he said, “Don’t wear any flowers,
I don’t like.” Then he said,

457
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:44,208
“You must wear bangles” because he comes
from a very traditional family.

458
00:42:44,409 --> 00:42:51,291
All My life I have worn bangles. It pleases
him, what’s the matter?

459
00:42:51,492 --> 00:42:54,981
Little, little things you do just to please
him,

460
00:42:55,158 --> 00:42:59,269
then he also starts thinking, “See, what
should I do for My wife?”.

461
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:04,044
But first it must start from woman,
not from man,

462
00:43:04,245 --> 00:43:07,677
because women are responsible
for the society.

463
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:14,156
In the western culture they had not told
what is their job is.

464
00:43:14,357 --> 00:43:18,972
Man’s job is economics, politics,
money earning.

465
00:43:19,173 --> 00:43:24,648
They have made a mess out of it, I agree
with you. It’s quite a big mess.

466
00:43:24,849 --> 00:43:29,268
But your job is to make the society.

467
00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:34,028
And to make the society, first you must
know how to keep children pleased,

468
00:43:34,229 --> 00:43:38,612
how to keep your husband pleased, how
to help and be close to them (Unclear).

469
00:43:38,813 --> 00:43:44,245
On the contrary, if you try all the time
to dominate,

470
00:43:44,446 --> 00:43:47,049
that’s not your job to dominate at all.

471
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:56,109
Your job is to make neutralize his
domination by simple, simple things.

472
00:43:56,966 --> 00:44:02,662
I’ll give you an example. Thank God
he is not here!

473
00:44:04,372 --> 00:44:10,771
He knows, he knows I’m very, I am very
clever in certain things.

474
00:44:10,972 --> 00:44:16,559
In his office he had a gentleman. I never
used to interfere with his office.

475
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,735
But there was one gentleman, good one,

476
00:44:19,936 --> 00:44:23,906
who gave up his organization and joined
another one

477
00:44:24,107 --> 00:44:27,957
because it was a private one, he was
getting more money, so he joined that.

478
00:44:28,158 --> 00:44:35,053
But there he found it was horrible, so he
wanted to come back to Shipping Corporation.

479
00:44:35,827 --> 00:44:38,790
But My husband is very particular about
rules and regulations.

480
00:44:38,991 --> 00:44:41,815
He said, “No, no, no, now I won’t have you,
I don’t want to see your face, get out”,

481
00:44:42,016 --> 00:44:48,843
this thing, that (thing). So he came to Me.
Normally, I never interfere.

482
00:44:49,044 --> 00:44:53,241
He came to Me and he said, “If You tell
him he might listen.”

483
00:44:53,442 --> 00:44:58,815
I said, “No, if I tell him he will never
listen. But I know how to do it.”

484
00:44:59,016 --> 00:45:03,522
So I told him that this gentleman came
to see Me.

485
00:45:03,723 --> 00:45:08,321
“Ha, so he’s come to the right person, now
are you going to trouble me about it?”

486
00:45:08,522 --> 00:45:13,275
I said, “No, no, no, not Me, but just think
why he came to Me.”

487
00:45:13,476 --> 00:45:17,401
He said, “Why?” “Because he thinks I’m more
generous than you are.”

488
00:45:17,602 --> 00:45:21,467
Immediately this competition.

489
00:45:26,902 --> 00:45:30,003
And that fellow got the job, he was
a great friend of his,

490
00:45:30,204 --> 00:45:33,169
even in London he was helping him a lot.

491
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:39,321
So, when we think that we have to control
our husband,

492
00:45:39,522 --> 00:45:44,023
it’s better to do it in a very simple way.

493
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:49,726
Only on fundamentals you can put down
your foot.

494
00:45:49,927 --> 00:45:53,407
Otherwise for small, small things,

495
00:45:53,608 --> 00:45:58,191
if you go on dominating your husband
I tell you, you will miss the point.

496
00:45:58,392 --> 00:46:04,824
You have married for stupidity or
for honeymoon?

497
00:46:06,269 --> 00:46:11,046
And in the West, especially in Italy, we
have had very bad experiences of women.

498
00:46:11,247 --> 00:46:15,988
English also, I must say. English girls
also have given Me lot of trouble.

499
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:21,729
I mean, they are banned now, because
I can’t help it.

500
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:27,565
One girl from Sri Lanka she was married
to somebody in…

501
00:46:27,766 --> 00:46:30,137
 [Aside, maybe to a child: “Sit down,
sit down”] -

502
00:46:30,338 --> 00:46:34,913
she was married to somebody in USA.

503
00:46:35,114 --> 00:46:42,468
Imagine from that horrible Sri Lanka where
there’s everyday at least 30 murders,

504
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:46,146
she got such a good chance to go to USA.

505
00:46:46,347 --> 00:46:53,412
Of course, USA’s also not a very great
place - but she started behaving

506
00:46:53,613 --> 00:46:59,944
as if she is a childish person and talking
to him in such a manner.

507
00:47:00,145 --> 00:47:05,584
He told Me “Mother, she is a sadist.
Whenever I telephone to her she talks to me

508
00:47:05,785 --> 00:47:11,170
in such a sarcastic manner and this
and that, that I’m surprised.”

509
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:15,082
I said, “A lady from Sri Lanka? I can’t
believe it!”

510
00:47:15,283 --> 00:47:20,357
Then he told Me what she talked to him and
how she talked to him. I was amazed.

511
00:47:20,558 --> 00:47:24,124
I mean, no man would be happy to hear
all these things.

512
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:30,842
But she thought she was very friendly, and
she was joking or something like that.

513
00:47:31,043 --> 00:47:34,982
This doesn’t work out in marriage.

514
00:47:35,915 --> 00:47:45,548
Man doesn’t want a wife to be on the horse
and beating with a whip.

515
00:47:45,749 --> 00:47:48,677
Why has he married?

516
00:47:48,878 --> 00:47:55,863
For the happiness, for the joy, for
the sweetness of a woman.

517
00:47:59,462 --> 00:48:01,854
 It’s a very important thing I wanted
to talk

518
00:48:02,055 --> 00:48:07,023
because so many of women are thinking
that they are something great.

519
00:48:07,224 --> 00:48:10,474
Some of them have some money, some of them
have some jobs,

520
00:48:10,675 --> 00:48:15,586
but first job is to keep the society
very happy

521
00:48:15,787 --> 00:48:20,078
and to keep your husband happy –
is the first job.

522
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:26,104
If a woman cannot keep the husband happy,
she is no good for us.

523
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:31,342
She is no good Sahaja Yogini. This is
a place, like a man

524
00:48:31,543 --> 00:48:34,687
who is working in the office, he has
to keep his boss pleased.

525
00:48:34,888 --> 00:48:38,821
If he doesn’t please his boss, he is
useless, he’s thrown out of.

526
00:48:39,022 --> 00:48:45,408
In the same way a woman has to think about
the husband, in a very kindly manner,

527
00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:51,032
because this is her job, this is why
she is marrying.

528
00:48:51,233 --> 00:48:55,528
Otherwise she should not marry, she can do
what she likes.

529
00:48:56,689 --> 00:49:02,037
It’s a difficult thing to convince anyone

530
00:49:02,214 --> 00:49:06,197
because, you see, men are right-sided,
they are hot-tempered.

531
00:49:06,398 --> 00:49:13,731
But I have told you just now how to capture
their anger.

532
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:19,860
I’ve seen also in the films, you see
all romantic scenes going on –

533
00:49:20,061 --> 00:49:22,733
it never happens, there’s nobody is
like that,

534
00:49:22,934 --> 00:49:25,751
you see, it’s all absurd things you see,

535
00:49:25,952 --> 00:49:31,288
so you expect them to be Clark Gable
or somebody, it’s not so.

536
00:49:33,467 --> 00:49:39,456
You have to love, you have to take
your husband into your heart first.

537
00:49:39,657 --> 00:49:44,517
This is your duty, otherwise what else
are you doing?

538
00:49:48,728 --> 00:49:51,866
I was shocked, a girl from Sri Lanka -
and this boy has said,

539
00:49:52,067 --> 00:49:55,814
“Mother, you can kill me, but I will not
have that girl here,

540
00:49:56,015 --> 00:50:00,311
because she is not joy-giving.”
It’s a fact.

541
00:50:00,512 --> 00:50:05,745
So if your wife is like that supposing -
now I am telling men.

542
00:50:07,383 --> 00:50:10,776
The trick of the trade is, if your wife
is like that,

543
00:50:10,977 --> 00:50:14,458
try to understand why she does it.

544
00:50:14,659 --> 00:50:19,463
What is her problem, why is she
dominating you?

545
00:50:19,664 --> 00:50:25,251
Or you think she is dominating you. Most
of the times, most of the men who talk,

546
00:50:25,452 --> 00:50:30,364
“Oh, wives are like this, wives”… they are
very dominating.

547
00:50:30,565 --> 00:50:36,045
Why is she dominating you, what’s wrong
with you, that she is dominating?

548
00:50:36,246 --> 00:50:42,225
If you introspect, you’ll find that you
give very little time to her.

549
00:50:42,426 --> 00:50:46,678
Now, the other part is, there was one lady,
she wanted to have a divorce.

550
00:50:46,879 --> 00:50:50,837
I said, “Why?” “Because he goes to work
all the time

551
00:50:51,038 --> 00:50:55,492
and he is not there and this and that.”

552
00:50:55,808 --> 00:50:59,149
But I said, “If you divorce, then you will
never be with him.

553
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:04,755
So why do you want to have a divorce?
At least, at least he gives you some time,

554
00:51:04,956 --> 00:51:08,984
but if you divorce, then he’ll never be
with you, so why do you ask for divorce?”

555
00:51:09,185 --> 00:51:11,975
I can’t understand the logic.

556
00:51:12,176 --> 00:51:16,673
I mean women should not be brainless,
isn’t it - to say such a thing.

557
00:51:16,874 --> 00:51:22,385
If you want to divorce your husband
for this – it’s absurd.

558
00:51:23,051 --> 00:51:31,655
Now, for men it is important that they
should give some time,

559
00:51:31,856 --> 00:51:38,005
pay some attention and get some things
that they like.

560
00:51:39,612 --> 00:51:42,198
Now, I’ll give you again My own example.

561
00:51:42,399 --> 00:51:47,214
My husband never brought any flowers
for Me, you all bring flowers for Me,

562
00:51:47,415 --> 00:51:52,763
but he never brought any flowers for Me,
whether it was birthday or anything.

563
00:51:52,964 --> 00:51:57,508
Then I realized that this man has no sense
of flowers.

564
00:51:57,709 --> 00:52:02,973
He doesn’t know what is a rose or what is
any other flower.

565
00:52:03,174 --> 00:52:07,337
And he might bring something which is
horrible, you know.

566
00:52:07,538 --> 00:52:10,793
Maybe (a) cactus he might bring.

567
00:52:11,444 --> 00:52:17,447
It’s better he doesn’t bring anything,
because that would be insulting, isn’t it?

568
00:52:17,648 --> 00:52:21,278
And then one day he admitted, “I don’t know
anything about flowers,

569
00:52:21,479 --> 00:52:26,548
now will you tell me – except for roses,
I don’t know anything.”

570
00:52:26,733 --> 00:52:30,517
And you’ll be amazed, even roses, he misses
out (for that? Indistinct).

571
00:52:30,718 --> 00:52:33,325
So, with such an ignorance of things,

572
00:52:33,526 --> 00:52:38,441
if your husband doesn’t do, it shows
consideration.

573
00:52:39,961 --> 00:52:47,298
But men should try to know what a woman
likes, what she wants.

574
00:52:47,499 --> 00:52:52,079
Moreover, men have their own style
of thinking.

575
00:52:52,287 --> 00:53:00,515
Now, to give My own example again,
better (it) is.

576
00:53:00,778 --> 00:53:03,627
He buys always very expensive things.

577
00:53:03,828 --> 00:53:08,063
So, I’ve told him, “Don’t buy anything
for Me.” So, “You don’t like?”

578
00:53:08,264 --> 00:53:13,315
“No, no, I like it, but too much of these
too expensive things, why should you buy?”

579
00:53:13,516 --> 00:53:18,898
So, he is very fond of buying these kind
of sweaters from that Scotch House,

580
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:24,041
very expensive they are, £250 each,
you know.

581
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:29,346
I don’t know how many I have, how many
in black, how many, you see.

582
00:53:29,547 --> 00:53:35,310
I told him, “I’ll get it from Switzerland,
they are much cheaper there” and all that.

583
00:53:35,511 --> 00:53:39,661
Then another is he wants to buy a cashmere
coat for Me, always.

584
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:43,480
I must be having at least 10 of them
hanging,

585
00:53:43,681 --> 00:53:47,403
but he likes to give that only – all right.

586
00:53:47,604 --> 00:53:52,259
So, I’m passing out them to My daughters,
granddaughters and all that.

587
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:56,413
Then what to do now? You see, men –
he doesn’t mean anything bad,

588
00:53:56,614 --> 00:54:02,234
but because he doesn’t know, doesn’t know.

589
00:54:02,435 --> 00:54:07,267
First thing he did was to, when in India,
before going to the Puja,

590
00:54:07,468 --> 00:54:14,135
he went to buy a sari for Me. The one
of My nephews went with him.

591
00:54:14,336 --> 00:54:20,873
So he says, “Give me the most expensive
sari that you have.”

592
00:54:21,074 --> 00:54:24,007
So these people thought there’s somebody
has come now.

593
00:54:24,208 --> 00:54:28,877
The shopkeepers could understand this
gentleman doesn’t know anything of it.

594
00:54:29,078 --> 00:54:32,652
So they brought out a sari, said,
“This is the most expensive,

595
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:36,762
the price is 45,000 rupees” – in those
days this was.

596
00:54:36,963 --> 00:54:40,014
“All right, all right, you give me. I have
a card, will you take the card?”

597
00:54:40,215 --> 00:54:43,586
“Yes, yes, we’ll take the card.” He bought
the sari for Me.

598
00:54:43,787 --> 00:54:49,568
It is so heavy, it is so heavy that it was
something…

599
00:54:49,769 --> 00:54:54,940
[Hindi aside]

600
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:58,380
That… what do you call that, arm.. – you
wear… Some yogis: Armor.

601
00:54:58,594 --> 00:55:02,516
Shri Mataji: Eh? Some yogis: Armor.
Shri Mataji: Very heavy, you know.

602
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:06,608
I said, “Now what?”
He said, “You must wear for the Puja."

603
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:11,130
I was walking like a giant, you know.

604
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,682
There’s a description of your Mother is
“Ati saumya Ati raudra” –

605
00:55:21,883 --> 00:55:25,918
She is extremely soft and extremely
terrible.

606
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:29,195
But, I don’t know with that sari,
how I sat!

607
00:55:29,396 --> 00:55:33,627
I sat in one place glued down into that.

608
00:55:33,828 --> 00:55:39,087
Now to get up I didn’t know how to get up
with that weight on My body. You see?

609
00:55:39,288 --> 00:55:44,799
And then I brought it and put it properly
in a box and this and that.

610
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,387
So he said, “When are you wearing that
next?” “Now,” I said, “Please,

611
00:55:48,588 --> 00:55:52,521
I’ve kept it nicely for one wedding,
I’ll wear sometime.”

612
00:55:52,722 --> 00:55:58,617
I promised him and kept it there, because
he doesn’t understand about saris.

613
00:55:59,371 --> 00:56:01,895
I know he doesn’t understand about saris.

614
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:06,941
So if he doesn’t understand, whatever
he buys, I say “All right”.

615
00:56:07,142 --> 00:56:09,825
And he spends so much money on those
things, you know,

616
00:56:10,026 --> 00:56:16,354
45,000 rupees for such a sari...
[Hindi words]

617
00:56:16,578 --> 00:56:23,107
So he doesn’t understand what is real,
what is unreal, nothing – doesn’t matter.

618
00:56:23,308 --> 00:56:28,181
You have to just see his heart, how he
is giving you,

619
00:56:28,382 --> 00:56:31,621
with what love he is giving you. He doesn’t
understand.

620
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:34,919
So what can you do, poor man, you know.

621
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:40,611
I always buy suit lengths for him or suits
for him, I always – Myself.

622
00:56:40,812 --> 00:56:43,757
Once he said, “All right, I’m going to buy
this time.” I said, “Better buy.”

623
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:47,445
He bought such a horrible one and he went
to the office

624
00:56:47,646 --> 00:56:52,602
and everybody said, “Sir, this is not
your taste.”

625
00:56:55,598 --> 00:56:57,790
So he threw it away, he said, “I will never
buy now,

626
00:56:57,991 --> 00:57:00,735
can you, better go and buy for myself.”

627
00:57:00,936 --> 00:57:06,051
See, it’s - but the trouble is if women
take interest and know

628
00:57:06,252 --> 00:57:08,951
what sort of color he will like and this
and that.

629
00:57:09,152 --> 00:57:15,103
And also public opinion is very important
for men, for example what the public says.

630
00:57:15,304 --> 00:57:19,989
Like once I painted My drawing room
with a very nice color,

631
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:25,827
pink and black film mixed – very nice.
Because it’s a sign of warmth.

632
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:27,625
He said, “What is this color you have
put it?

633
00:57:27,826 --> 00:57:30,915
You should have done this and that”,
he started shouting.

634
00:57:31,116 --> 00:57:34,886
I said, “All right, tomorrow we are having
a party, after that I’ll change it.”

635
00:57:35,087 --> 00:57:39,293
Next day the people came in, they said,
“Oh, what a color, what a color,

636
00:57:39,494 --> 00:57:44,071
how have you made this color, how did…?”
He started looking at Me.

637
00:57:44,272 --> 00:57:49,202
I said, “Should I remove it?”
“No, no, no, no, no, it’s very nice.”

638
00:57:51,356 --> 00:57:55,631
Men care for public opinion very much
and you should see

639
00:57:55,816 --> 00:58:01,764
that you create a good public opinion
in his presence,

640
00:58:01,965 --> 00:58:05,900
so that he’ll appreciate you. All these
are tricks, you see?

641
00:58:06,101 --> 00:58:12,088
I tell you, men are very simple, but you
have to understand them.

642
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:14,674
Sometimes they get angry, doesn’t matter.

643
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:19,555
Actually, if they are angry with somebody
else, they will come and put it on you.

644
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:23,920
It’s better, because if they do anything
to others, they’ll beat them.

645
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:27,025
You are not going to beat (them).

646
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:33,342
If you understand few things about men,
it can work out.

647
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:36,470
Of course, some are very miserable
husbands, I know,

648
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:40,444
and some miserable wives – for them we have
divorce allowed

649
00:58:40,645 --> 00:58:44,454
in our Sahaja Yoga, we have divorce
for them.

650
00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:48,313
So that is the thing I wanted to tell you,

651
00:58:48,514 --> 00:58:53,237
that you should make a very good housewife,
a very good Gruha Lakshmi.

652
00:58:53,438 --> 00:59:00,455
Now, why I am telling you this, that I am
suffering from Gruha Lakshmi’s chakra,

653
00:59:00,656 --> 00:59:05,130
and all the doctors have told Me it is
because in the collective

654
00:59:05,338 --> 00:59:13,580
Gruha Lakshmis are not all right, because
they are not good housewives.

655
00:59:13,781 --> 00:59:19,161
Like I’ll tell you now we have Swiss women.
They are very good, agreed about that,

656
00:59:19,362 --> 00:59:25,784
but very fond of cleanliness. Swiss are
mad after cleanliness, women, women.

657
00:59:25,991 --> 00:59:29,474
You can’t talk to them even for five
minutes. If you are sitting there

658
00:59:29,675 --> 00:59:32,241
they are picking up this, picking up that,
picking up that, picking all the…,

659
00:59:32,442 --> 00:59:37,515
cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. It’s very
difficult, Swiss women.

660
00:59:37,716 --> 00:59:40,259
Now, I was… - Eritrea,

661
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:45,664
Alga told Me that the women of Eritrea
are known to be Swiss women.

662
00:59:45,865 --> 00:59:52,475
So, doesn’t matter if the house is little
untidy, if there’s something fallen off.

663
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:55,497
In India no woman will do that.

664
00:59:55,698 --> 01:00:00,057
Now, the guests are sitting and she’s
with the Hoover.

665
01:00:05,707 --> 01:00:11,685
Like another thing is, like anything
breaks, say,

666
01:00:11,886 --> 01:00:15,118
supposing the thermometer breaks –
in India they’ll say, “Very good,

667
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:19,508
now there will be no temperature,
thermometer’s broken.”

668
01:00:19,709 --> 01:00:22,607
But I’ve seen in the West, it’s very
surprising,

669
01:00:22,808 --> 01:00:29,093
supposing some coffee spills, I’m a guest,
immediately they’ll bring the Hoover,

670
01:00:29,294 --> 01:00:32,685
bring something to clean it –
in the presence of the person.

671
01:00:32,886 --> 01:00:35,706
Now, if a glass breaks, finished.

672
01:00:35,907 --> 01:00:39,767
It’s not important. This is a very subtle
type of materialism, I think,

673
01:00:39,968 --> 01:00:43,778
that the person is sitting there, who is
a guest,

674
01:00:43,979 --> 01:00:51,124
and why are you trying to do all these
things in her presence or in his presence?

675
01:00:51,325 --> 01:00:55,378
But this Western women never understand.

676
01:00:55,579 --> 01:01:01,593
Another thing is, now, you go to an Indian
house. Their color scheme is different.

677
01:01:01,793 --> 01:01:07,244
If you go to south Indians theirs is
different. Everybody has their own taste.

678
01:01:07,445 --> 01:01:10,956
As soon as they will enter –
Western women –

679
01:01:11,157 --> 01:01:15,268
“What a color scheme! What a thing you
have bought! Oh my God, this is horrible.”

680
01:01:15,469 --> 01:01:20,123
Immediately they will criticize
on the face.

681
01:01:20,324 --> 01:01:25,524
So another point is that you must always
consider the feelings of others.

682
01:01:25,725 --> 01:01:34,105
Woman is there to give proper understanding
of feelings of others, what they think.

683
01:01:34,306 --> 01:01:41,739
Or they go to an Indian house which
will be smelling of their food, “Huh”.

684
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:45,153
They’ll eat the same food, they’ll enjoy
the food,

685
01:01:45,354 --> 01:01:51,161
but they’ll try to show, to show that it is
something lower.

686
01:01:51,362 --> 01:01:54,015
This is very Western, I must say.

687
01:01:54,216 --> 01:02:01,055
If somebody is wearing a dress, immediately
they’ll pass a remark.

688
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:06,952
Very Western idea. You will not find
good Indians doing that,

689
01:02:07,153 --> 01:02:10,924
I don’t know about the modern Indians
what sort of things they are.

690
01:02:11,125 --> 01:02:15,204
But immediately they’ll say things which
will hurt.

691
01:02:15,405 --> 01:02:18,937
This is not the way a woman should look.

692
01:02:19,138 --> 01:02:23,848
On the contrary, always praise -
what’s the harm?

693
01:02:24,049 --> 01:02:30,275
By praising something you are not losing
your business.

694
01:02:30,476 --> 01:02:37,989
By saying, “What a nice thing, what a nice
sari, what nice clothes” – what’s the harm?

695
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:42,819
You’ll enjoy your sweetness, you know?
Really enjoy your sweetness.

696
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:47,140
It’s not telling lies, not to be that
honest also necessary.

697
01:02:47,341 --> 01:02:50,385
Because you don’t like something you must
say, “I don’t like it.”

698
01:02:50,586 --> 01:03:00,789
This word has to go from Sahaja Yoga.
“I like this and I don’t like that."

699
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:08,595
If I, say, saying that, how many will
remain in Sahaja Yoga?

700
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:18,201
So it’s very important to drop this
“I like it, I don’t like it.”

701
01:03:18,386 --> 01:03:20,813
Who are you to like or not like?

702
01:03:21,014 --> 01:03:25,951
What about your Spirit? What about
your heart?

703
01:03:26,152 --> 01:03:32,342
So again the same thing comes to,
that women have to have a heart,

704
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:40,346
very large heart, beautiful heart.
And your Guru is a Mother,

705
01:03:40,547 --> 01:03:45,132
so you have to be wonderful mothers
and wonderful wives

706
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:49,842
and should have very, very large hearts.

707
01:03:53,442 --> 01:04:02,053
So that all this selfishness, even this
bank will collapse if you do that.

708
01:04:02,254 --> 01:04:05,458
It is existing because we have small
hearts.

709
01:04:05,659 --> 01:04:11,473
If you have large hearts this will
collapse – isn’t it?

710
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:19,171
I have said it, especially because I’ve had
many complaints about the women

711
01:04:19,372 --> 01:04:26,385
who are married here, some Indian women
also. That’s why I’m telling you.

712
01:04:26,586 --> 01:04:31,442
Best reports are about Russian women
I must say,

713
01:04:31,643 --> 01:04:34,749
very, very good reports about them.

714
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:39,853
They are very satisfied souls, they want
very little, they are not greedy.

715
01:04:40,054 --> 01:04:43,213
It’s surprising, communism has done
so much good to them.

716
01:04:43,414 --> 01:04:49,385
It’s not communism, but the extremities
of communism has thrown them

717
01:04:49,586 --> 01:04:57,184
into that area where they don’t have any
sense of possession, they don’t have.

718
01:04:57,385 --> 01:05:00,236
Their government said, “All right, you can
have your flats and look after them.”

719
01:05:00,437 --> 01:05:04,002
Said, “We don’t want to have, you have it.”

720
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:07,285
Government servants were told that
“you can have your cars”.

721
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:11,172
Said, “No, no, we don’t want, you’d
better have.”

722
01:05:11,373 --> 01:05:16,164
Because just to own the car is such
a headache – they know.

723
01:05:16,365 --> 01:05:20,112
Let the government have the headache.
They are not, you know,

724
01:05:20,313 --> 01:05:24,582
sort of people who are even conscious
of possessiveness.

725
01:05:24,783 --> 01:05:28,013
Of course, now, they had some funny people.

726
01:05:28,214 --> 01:05:32,614
I’m forgetting his name, who was finance
minister you had,

727
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:39,127
and he was in Geneva, where he learned
all the tricks of the trade

728
01:05:39,297 --> 01:05:42,441
and he brought forth lots of reforms,
so-called.

729
01:05:42,642 --> 01:05:48,147
So now Leningrad and Moscow have become
very expensive places –

730
01:05:48,348 --> 01:05:50,868
thanks to Swiss influence.

731
01:05:51,069 --> 01:05:56,043
So this has happened there also, but still
the people are very good,

732
01:05:56,250 --> 01:06:01,727
and the ladies who come from there, even
Romanian girls are very much respected,

733
01:06:01,928 --> 01:06:06,510
now everybody wants Romanian or Russians,

734
01:06:11,748 --> 01:06:15,763
or from Kiev. But this time they didn’t
come,

735
01:06:15,964 --> 01:06:21,289
we are sorry they are not here, I’m missing
them all.

736
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:28,391
Lastly, I have to tell you that there’s
a very good book, Arun Apte has written.

737
01:06:29,707 --> 01:06:32,869
This is the book. You all should buy it.

738
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:36,484
I don’t know, what is the price you have
put it?

739
01:06:36,685 --> 01:06:40,003
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi about
the book and its price]

740
01:07:02,423 --> 01:07:05,689
Alright. So, those who want to have
this book should apply.

741
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:09,470
There are only five, are here,
very good book.

742
01:07:09,671 --> 01:07:14,520
So, you will understand about Indian music.

743
01:07:14,721 --> 01:07:20,919
It is said that this music has come
from Omkara.

744
01:07:21,353 --> 01:07:28,234
And it is very sort of – sensible music.

745
01:07:28,435 --> 01:07:34,686
Now, I think all those musicians who sang
before Me,

746
01:07:34,887 --> 01:07:39,623
who were singing western song, was alright.

747
01:07:39,824 --> 01:07:44,958
But what is missing in that: melody.
It’s not melodious.

748
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:48,401
You see, is like little bit you sing,
then you sing this,

749
01:07:48,602 --> 01:07:52,199
then you shout, then you bring it down,
then do like this.

750
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,468
And they think that they have to sing
through their heart.

751
01:07:56,669 --> 01:08:00,116
They have to express the feeling
of their heart.

752
01:08:00,317 --> 01:08:04,557
Now, supposing somebody is dejected,
so he sings the song of dejection.

753
01:08:04,758 --> 01:08:08,867
Then another one who is talking about love,
he starts to sing a song.

754
01:08:09,044 --> 01:08:14,565
He may not be, but artificially they want
to produce that effect.

755
01:08:14,766 --> 01:08:22,628
There is no need; to sing in parts,
like one word, then one word,

756
01:08:22,829 --> 01:08:26,465
there’s no melody in it, there’s no flow
in it.

757
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:33,065
And, while, Russian songs, though they
were folk songs, were very melodious.

758
01:08:33,266 --> 01:08:37,435
But don’t worry, Americans are invading
that part also.

759
01:08:37,636 --> 01:08:40,194
They are having all this horrible music
there.

760
01:08:40,395 --> 01:08:45,815
Now, the music means, it should please you.
It should give you more entertainment;

761
01:08:46,016 --> 01:08:50,201
not to make you unhappy, not to make
you sad.

762
01:08:50,382 --> 01:08:57,524
If you have all these feelings within you,
then you should try to say like this:

763
01:08:57,692 --> 01:09:02,031
“Yes, there is problem, but I’ll get
over it.”

764
01:09:02,232 --> 01:09:06,131
Because you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
to show the victory;

765
01:09:06,332 --> 01:09:08,962
the victorious nature of yours,
in your music.

766
01:09:09,163 --> 01:09:14,120
I’m not talking about others; they go on
crying, weeping and singing.

767
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:19,101
But there is no melody first of all, it is
just part, part, part, part.

768
01:09:19,326 --> 01:09:22,761
Even the orchestra, which I was surprised:
it all goes like this

769
01:09:22,962 --> 01:09:27,456
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”, then it goes
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”.

770
01:09:27,657 --> 01:09:37,333
But Indian orchestra, you will see,
is melodious. It flows like a river.

771
01:09:37,534 --> 01:09:43,978
So, this difference is very bad. So, I would
request all the musicians who are singing,

772
01:09:44,179 --> 01:09:55,007
the singing doesn’t mean that you use words
which nobody can understand.

773
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:59,754
Words must be clear-cut and the melody
must be there.

774
01:09:59,955 --> 01:10:05,941
Now, in Indian ragas, there is melody
but words are not important.

775
01:10:06,141 --> 01:10:08,082
So, you enjoy the tune and everything,

776
01:10:08,283 --> 01:10:12,192
whether you know the language or not,
doesn’t matter.

777
01:10:12,393 --> 01:10:16,566
So, when you can combine melody
with western music,

778
01:10:16,767 --> 01:10:20,211
you will see how different it will be.

779
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:25,932
And this book will teach you. This is
a very good book,

780
01:10:26,133 --> 01:10:28,777
which you should have, and which you should
understand

781
01:10:28,978 --> 01:10:38,213
that how the music can cure you,
music can give you joy,

782
01:10:38,414 --> 01:10:44,711
what is the basic, the essence of music.
And then you can flower it out.

783
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:50,149
I am sure, if Indian musicians take
to western music,

784
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:56,353
will be much better than to western music
as it is.

785
01:10:57,802 --> 01:11:01,431
I can’t understand, these people are
so famous

786
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:05,614
and people think they are very well-earning
and all that.

787
01:11:05,815 --> 01:11:11,209
In America, anybody can earn like that,
but to make it a proper music,

788
01:11:11,410 --> 01:11:14,158
I think you must have the basis
of Indian music.

789
01:11:14,359 --> 01:11:18,051
Then you can expand it as you like.

790
01:11:18,252 --> 01:11:24,376
Now, please try to buy this book,
to understand Indian music.

791
01:11:24,577 --> 01:11:28,841
There’s no price yet given, but it won’t be
much more than normal,

792
01:11:29,042 --> 01:11:35,320
so next time, I think for Diwali Puja, they
might bring more. Eh? Ganapatipule.

793
01:11:35,608 --> 01:11:42,172
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi to know
when the book will be available]

794
01:11:42,704 --> 01:11:45,043
Accha.

795
01:11:45,244 --> 01:11:50,011
I will try to get more of these, but this
you must really read,

796
01:11:50,212 --> 01:11:56,585
because you will know what is the essence
of music, alright?

797
01:11:56,786 --> 01:12:06,507
And, lastly, today is the 4th day
of Navaratri

798
01:12:06,934 --> 01:12:15,070
and they have given Me - some of them
are names which are really horrid,

799
01:12:19,108 --> 01:12:24,011
but they must be people who have suffered
so much

800
01:12:24,212 --> 01:12:31,301
and they asked Mother to kill those
horrible rakshasas.

801
01:12:31,502 --> 01:12:39,751
Now in a way, it all will kill in its
natural course, I know that.

802
01:12:39,952 --> 01:12:46,688
If you people take to sense, because you
are the ones who can do it.

803
01:12:46,889 --> 01:12:55,209
If you do not try to acquire things which
you don’t want, unnecessary things.

804
01:12:55,410 --> 01:13:03,476
If you try to reduce all these things
and take to something natural

805
01:13:03,677 --> 01:13:08,584
and love the Mother Earth, I am sure
it will work out.

806
01:13:08,759 --> 01:13:12,875
The Mother Earth herself will work it out.

807
01:13:13,076 --> 01:13:19,700
You know this earthquake. Now nobody
is going in the church.

808
01:13:19,901 --> 01:13:25,257
But I didn’t do anything. It’s the Mother
Earth.

809
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:32,429
Now nobody goes in the church. What -
I didn’t do anything, I would not.

810
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:40,206
I was sorry for the art-pieces gone, but
see now how the nature is working out.

811
01:13:40,407 --> 01:13:46,912
Now Islamic people, these Islamic people
from Indonesia onward,

812
01:13:47,113 --> 01:13:52,902
all these people are suffering from
the smoke – I didn’t do that.

813
01:13:53,103 --> 01:13:56,409
Because when you try to do something wrong

814
01:13:56,610 --> 01:14:00,706
it comes back to you. Action has
a reaction.

815
01:14:03,388 --> 01:14:07,675
So, your faces should be Sahaj. You should
be Sahaj.

816
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:13,760
You shouldn’t look like strained people.
I can’t understand.

817
01:14:13,961 --> 01:14:19,825
You are Sahaj and be in that Sahaj mood.
I’m sorry I’ve taken so much time,

818
01:14:20,026 --> 01:14:23,682
but tomorrow I won’t be able to speak
all these things to you.

819
01:14:23,883 --> 01:14:28,744
And you should try to think about it,
that “Our Mother loves me,

820
01:14:28,945 --> 01:14:33,129
She wants us to have a good family, She
wants us to look after our children.”

821
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:38,268
So, I have advised all the men, as well
as the women.

822
01:14:38,469 --> 01:14:41,909
It’s better to be hen-pecked, there’s
no harm.

823
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:45,597
But hen-pecked doesn’t mean they are
hen-pecked.

824
01:14:45,798 --> 01:14:51,363
See, they are – just to please your wife,
what’s the harm?

825
01:14:53,137 --> 01:14:59,211
But that doesn’t mean if she dominates you.
That’s not the thing.

826
01:14:59,412 --> 01:15:03,756
Like, “Come to my father’s house, I must
go to my mother’s house”.

827
01:15:03,956 --> 01:15:07,663
All these kind of things you should not
permit.

828
01:15:07,864 --> 01:15:12,947
But women should also understand,
her family is more important

829
01:15:13,148 --> 01:15:17,731
than father, mother, even Mataji.

830
01:15:19,032 --> 01:15:23,961
Because I’ll be only happy to see a happy
family.

831
01:15:24,901 --> 01:15:27,174
So, thank you very much.
