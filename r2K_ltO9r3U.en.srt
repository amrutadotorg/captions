1
00:00:05,624 --> 00:00:11,685
I bow to all those who have found the truth

2
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:17,891
and those who are still trying to find.

3
00:00:20,748 --> 00:00:25,360
The greatest problem of human beings is,

4
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:30,010
surprising, that they don’t know themselves.

5
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:33,438
They don’t know what powers they have.

6
00:00:33,716 --> 00:00:37,124
They don’t know what properties they have.

7
00:00:37,298 --> 00:00:40,550
They don’t know to what height they can rise.

8
00:00:41,224 --> 00:00:46,522
This is the main problem of ignorance about yourself.

9
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:51,293
If you could just peep in your heart

10
00:00:51,444 --> 00:00:56,459
and start thinking about the spiritual life

11
00:00:56,613 --> 00:01:02,417
that you could have, you would know you are a treasure,

12
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:07,330
 treasure of powers of love,

13
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:13,480
powers of justice and powers of wisdom.

14
00:01:14,028 --> 00:01:20,958
The problem is we have no idea as to what we are

15
00:01:21,943 --> 00:01:25,519
and Sahaja Yogis also, they are so humble

16
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,547
 that they do not realize what powers they have,

17
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:34,655
 and sometimes I find they are little shy
 to talk about Sahaja Yoga

18
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:41,206
 or to tell about others because they think 
it might be their ego that is bigger.

19
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:48,656
Now, I have to tell you one thing that ego will always deflate,

20
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:54,005
it will always deflate when you will face the society.

21
00:01:55,077 --> 00:01:57,331
Unless and until you face others

22
00:01:57,458 --> 00:02:01,167
your ego cannot come down. Now, how?

23
00:02:01,437 --> 00:02:08,907
The ego is there because when you think 
that others are better than you,

24
00:02:09,622 --> 00:02:15,040
when you are afraid to say that they have to transform,

25
00:02:15,706 --> 00:02:22,271
and when you are worried that you are being very aggressive.

26
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:29,031
If you are a Sahaja Yogi and if you are meditating everyday,

27
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,876
 you are cleansing yourself.

28
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:39,829
You have a power within yourself 
which will show its results.

29
00:02:39,963 --> 00:02:46,400
It will show its powers and manifestation in such a big way

30
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:54,572
that you start surprising at yourself – “Is it what I am?”

31
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:58,974
With the Kundalini awakening what happens

32
00:02:59,197 --> 00:03:05,052
 that all this petty things as we call in Sanskrit “Shadripus”,

33
00:03:06,073 --> 00:03:08,868
 they all drop out.

34
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:12,188
But we must face ourselves.

35
00:03:13,011 --> 00:03:15,882
Some people in Sahaja Yoga thinks

36
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:20,173
that we can become a very great people

37
00:03:20,222 --> 00:03:23,938
or we’d achieve some great positions and all that.

38
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:27,222
That’s not the point. It’s not outside.

39
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:30,116
It’s not the outside ambition,

40
00:03:30,267 --> 00:03:35,774
but the inner light which has to shine through you.

41
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:40,540
All of you are quite intelligent

42
00:03:40,715 --> 00:03:44,532
and are experts, I should say,

43
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:48,260
as far as the chakra knowledge is concerned.

44
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:51,939
But what about the knowledge of yourself?

45
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:55,077
Do you know about yourself

46
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,085
what you can do, what you are capable of?

47
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:02,420
That’s the point where we are missing.

48
00:04:02,507 --> 00:04:05,389
All right, it is the urge within

49
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:08,715
 because you have got your self-realization.

50
00:04:09,133 --> 00:04:16,108
But you still lack in one thing is a complete confidence in yourself,

51
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:18,955
that you know the truth.

52
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:24,937
And, as the people who know the truth what you have to do

53
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:28,821
is to spread the truth to make

54
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:34,904
this darkness of ignorance pass away.

55
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:38,711
But in Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people when they come

56
00:04:38,901 --> 00:04:44,039
 they start getting ideas about themselves and trying to organize things.

57
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:46,621
They do all kinds of things.
I know that.

58
00:04:47,372 --> 00:04:52,949
Instead of that, if you get full picture about yourself –

59
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:57,745
what you are capable of and what you can achieve

60
00:04:57,975 --> 00:05:01,427
 by giving realizations to others,

61
00:05:01,586 --> 00:05:05,340
by making them understand what are

62
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:09,777
their powers are, not yours, their powers are.

63
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:11,982
What they can achieve.

64
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:17,217
I tell you, we can go very fast with the spreading of Sahaja Yoga.

65
00:05:17,854 --> 00:05:21,979
But this fear that we may develop ego,

66
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:25,779
there are many who have this kind of a nonsensical idea.

67
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:28,156
You cannot.

68
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,037
Because the more you will meditate,
 the more you will face yourself,

69
00:05:33,248 --> 00:05:39,181
you will know that you have so many great things within you

70
00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:45,291
 just like a storehouse of jewels.

71
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:49,047
You must respect yourself

72
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:53,500
and you must know within yourself what you have got.

73
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:56,537
Not what you want to achieve outside.

74
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,383
Like, there are some who trying to be, say, leaders, this, that …

75
00:06:01,516 --> 00:06:06,196
That’s all nonsense. That’s of no worth.

76
00:06:06,385 --> 00:06:11,952
The best thing is to know that you are a treasure

77
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,484
of great value system within you

78
00:06:15,658 --> 00:06:18,867
and you can awaken that. You have powers.

79
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:23,383
You can do that very easily without hurting anyone,

80
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:28,313
without troubling anybody, 
without taking any money, all kinds of things.

81
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:33,041
But as it is I find,

82
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:36,487
 the people are either money oriented

83
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:40,550
or power oriented outside.

84
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:42,586
Not inside.

85
00:06:42,738 --> 00:06:47,212
Inside is the wealth; inside is the power;

86
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:51,665
 inside everything that you can think of.

87
00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:56,980
There are people I know who never used to 
come on the stage to speak even.

88
00:06:57,766 --> 00:07:00,636
Now, they have become great speakers.

89
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:05,292
And, I am amazed to see how they have been transformed.

90
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:11,181
The greatest transformation is that you know yourself fully well

91
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,946
and that with that knowledge you change others.

92
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:18,528
Don’t keep yourself limited to yourself.

93
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:21,355
You have to spread out.

94
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,068
This power has been given to you

95
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:27,917
to know yourself fully, and to be confident

96
00:07:28,212 --> 00:07:30,670
and to be kind and gentle

97
00:07:30,877 --> 00:07:34,188
and talk to people in that way that they know

98
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:37,521
that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

99
00:07:39,645 --> 00:07:45,192
It is not given to you just to say that you are Sahaja Yogis

100
00:07:45,303 --> 00:07:48,168
 but to know yourself fully,

101
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:53,516
to peep into your own treasures, into your understanding.

102
00:07:53,793 --> 00:07:58,354
Now, I must say, there are so many people in this world,
 millions and millions.

103
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:01,542
Why you people have come to Sahaja Yoga?

104
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:04,630
I didn’t choose you. You chose Me.

105
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:09,130
And, when you have chosen Me, you must know within yourself

106
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:12,138
that “there must be something in me

107
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:15,168
 that has made me come to Sahaja Yoga

108
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:17,843
and to understand the subtle system."

109
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:19,840
It’s a very subtle system

110
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,634
and it can be known only to very subtle people

111
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:26,005
 and not to gross people.

112
00:08:26,294 --> 00:08:31,932
But if you yourself discover yourself

113
00:08:32,162 --> 00:08:36,376
 and then you go ahead, there cannot be any ego

114
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:38,430
because you are not ego.

115
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:41,522
Those who have ego, as I told you,

116
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,175
they even make money out of Sahaja Yoga, they even try

117
00:08:45,344 --> 00:08:51,347
to organize things something to promote them.

118
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:54,241
They are on a very different level.

119
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:59,386
But if you are not that kind then you should not become just stationary.

120
00:08:59,489 --> 00:09:03,169
You should do what it is to find out – What am I?

121
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:05,376
What am I?

122
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:07,881
Christ has said, “Know Thyself."

123
00:09:08,032 --> 00:09:10,630
Mohammed Sahib has said, “Know Thyself."

124
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:14,039
All of them have said, “Know Thyself."

125
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,100
That means you are something great.

126
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:22,444
You have a hidden properties within you which you do not know.

127
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:26,322
Once you know yourself you will have self respect,

128
00:09:26,449 --> 00:09:30,371
you will not do wrong things, you will have no anger.

129
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,097
But you will be an ocean of love.

130
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:35,681
That’s what it has to be.

131
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,707
That is what Sahaja Yoga is.

132
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,122
I understand that these are the worst days,

133
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:44,523
 it’s the “Aghor Kaliyuga” as people say. All right.

134
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:48,845
But why are you here during this time?

135
00:09:49,328 --> 00:09:51,744
To enlighten people.

136
00:09:51,955 --> 00:09:54,511
To give them the right ideas.

137
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:58,561
But how unless and until you do not know yourself fully

138
00:09:58,696 --> 00:10:01,916
 that you are capable of this and you are capable of that.

139
00:10:02,142 --> 00:10:07,722
You see, the life of all great men, I would say, people like Abraham Lincoln.

140
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:14,492
He realized in very young age that he has to

141
00:10:15,191 --> 00:10:19,130
assert on others his own value system

142
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:22,085
 by showing his own example.

143
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:27,889
Though it was very hard for people to understand him,

144
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:32,400
still he has shown such results.

145
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:35,516
I have read many lives of this kind.

146
00:10:35,793 --> 00:10:38,502
Like, in Turkey, we had Ataturk.

147
00:10:38,627 --> 00:10:41,007
We had everywhere one person like that.

148
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:44,136
In India, we had Lal Bahadur Shastri

149
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,663
who was such a great man and who knew about Sahaja Yoga,

150
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:51,029
 who used to respect Me so much.

151
00:10:51,142 --> 00:10:53,814
People would wonder why should he respect Me

152
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:56,663
more than he would respect My husband or anyone,

153
00:10:56,915 --> 00:10:59,712
 because he realized what I was.

154
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:03,275
But he was not, he didn’t get the chance.

155
00:11:03,434 --> 00:11:05,332
Now, you people have a chance.

156
00:11:05,517 --> 00:11:08,477
All right, I am quite old now.

157
00:11:08,658 --> 00:11:12,070
It’s correct. But still I am not going to give up.

158
00:11:12,387 --> 00:11:15,561
Till I live I’ll work very hard

159
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:19,291
to convince you about your own,

160
00:11:20,124 --> 00:11:24,829
your own personality, your own self.

161
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,560
That’s what I am living for.

162
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,628
Till you are completely convinced.

163
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,363
You will be amazed that people who come to Sahaja Yoga

164
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:38,270
also do all kinds of nonsensical things.
I know they do.

165
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,805
But they are not Sahaja Yogis in a way.

166
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:44,373
Because unless and until you go deep into yourself,

167
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:50,185
 unless and until you find out what is your personality

168
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:52,717
 in the real sense of the word,

169
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:59,829
whatever you may try, whatever you may do, it is not Sahaja.

170
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:02,399
Sahaja means spontaneous.

171
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:05,047
It comes spontaneously to you.

172
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:09,624
As it is we know, in Sahaja Yoga you get connected

173
00:12:09,751 --> 00:12:13,774
to that area which Einstein has called as torsion area.

174
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:18,384
But that torsion area is there behind you,

175
00:12:18,463 --> 00:12:21,948
Paramachaitnya is there to support you, to help you.

176
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:25,362
All of you have got this, but despite that

177
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:29,815
you don’t believe it, believe into it, believe in yourself.

178
00:12:29,997 --> 00:12:32,993
You have that power within you.

179
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:36,662
I know of one fellow who was in Bombay.

180
00:12:36,904 --> 00:12:40,653
He was a fisherman and a great Sahaja Yogi.

181
00:12:40,685 --> 00:12:42,980
I should we have lost him.

182
00:12:43,576 --> 00:12:48,583
So, one day he was going to another island

183
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:53,289
for spreading Sahaja Yoga among fishermen.

184
00:12:53,841 --> 00:13:00,616
And, he found in the sky such black clouds threatening.

185
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,060
So he came out and he threatened them,

186
00:13:04,203 --> 00:13:07,705
 “I am going for my Mother’s work.

187
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:11,645
How dare you bring the rain?

188
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:15,952
You should not rain, bring the rain till I come back."

189
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:18,175
And, it was surprising.

190
00:13:18,312 --> 00:13:23,370
He went down, did all his jobs everything,
 came back after five hours.

191
00:13:23,521 --> 00:13:26,851
And, when he went to bed it started thundering.

192
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:32,876
The nature will be with you, because nature is our representative.

193
00:13:33,265 --> 00:13:34,632
It helps us.

194
00:13:34,812 --> 00:13:39,112
If you are of that quality, nature will stand by you.

195
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:43,395
You have seen that many a times, nature has helped Me.

196
00:13:43,728 --> 00:13:47,963
It is not because I have any control over them, I tell them anything,

197
00:13:48,087 --> 00:13:55,079
 but only thing they realize that I am here for such an such work.

198
00:13:55,322 --> 00:13:58,129
And that I am to be supported.

199
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:03,145
In the same way, if you can establish it the nature will know

200
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:07,769
that you are the people who are here to

201
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:12,400
redeem the whole universe. You can do it.

202
00:14:12,427 --> 00:14:16,673
I may think that the whole world should be redeemed and all that.

203
00:14:16,776 --> 00:14:18,060
But, how can I do it?

204
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,659
If I could have done it, I would not have anything.

205
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:22,286
I have to have channels.

206
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:25,529
And, these channels who know their job,

207
00:14:25,585 --> 00:14:30,599
 they know themselves, those who are quite capable of doing it.

208
00:14:31,313 --> 00:14:33,394
You are special people no doubt.

209
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:35,726
Otherwise why are you here?

210
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:45,271
But that specialty is this 
that you are a good conductor of this Divine energy.

211
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:47,630
You are a wonderful conductor.

212
00:14:47,825 --> 00:14:49,426
You are an expert on that.

213
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,269
It just works.

214
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:58,370
It works automatically 
but your connection with the Divine should be absolute.

215
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:02,393
Now, talking about absolute values is correct.

216
00:15:02,555 --> 00:15:07,229
But these absolute values, do they exist within us or not?

217
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:12,069
If they do, then why not we make others imbibe them?

218
00:15:12,204 --> 00:15:15,262
It’s not difficult.
It’s not at all difficult I tell you.

219
00:15:15,473 --> 00:15:18,009
I am just an ordinary housewife.

220
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:21,769
What? It’s just My love.

221
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:26,109
Just My, I should say, My nature itself

222
00:15:26,815 --> 00:15:31,139
 that it has worked. I was sure about Myself.

223
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:35,291
Though outside I may look a very humble housewife.

224
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:38,706
People used to think I don’t speak much because I don’t know English.

225
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:42,530
This was the situation. But that’s not the point.

226
00:15:42,627 --> 00:15:46,391
The point is, I knew what I was.

227
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:51,083
I knew what I am, and I knew what I have to be.

228
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:53,618
That’s all. That’s the only difference.

229
00:15:53,831 --> 00:16:00,451
If you people develop that knowledge within yourself, 
you can be dynamic.

230
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:05,101
You will not have ambitions, you will not have some desires,

231
00:16:05,228 --> 00:16:09,986
 you will not have anger, you will not have greed.

232
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:12,777
All these drop out like that.

233
00:16:13,116 --> 00:16:17,996
First of all, we have to know what is our basis.

234
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:25,017
And the most important basis is that we are born in a particular country.

235
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:29,231
And we should get concerned about that.

236
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,829
They say that I was a revolutionary and all that I did.

237
00:16:32,862 --> 00:16:35,158
I went to jail, everything I did.

238
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:41,195
But that was just to get My country, country’s independence.

239
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,753
That was different.

240
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:46,099
But after that independence what should have happened

241
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:50,657
is to make people realize what they are.

242
00:16:51,434 --> 00:16:55,426
Not only India, it’s in every country one has to understand

243
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:58,450
what is the need of that country.

244
00:16:58,632 --> 00:17:06,983
What they have to do to improve, to help, to rise, to transform.

245
00:17:07,323 --> 00:17:12,139
You should not, I never asked you that you change your names

246
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:16,129
or anything though you ask for Indian names. All right.

247
00:17:16,264 --> 00:17:22,150
But what is My main concern is that you should have concern for your countrymen.

248
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:24,682
You are so empowered.

249
00:17:24,968 --> 00:17:29,960
Your kundalini has reached that state where you can do a lot.

250
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:34,259
I know some of you have done a lot and have worked out.

251
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:37,793
But still all of you have to do it.

252
00:17:37,985 --> 00:17:42,943
I would just say, the seven…seventy-eighth birthday, I forget also,

253
00:17:43,031 --> 00:17:47,376
seventy-eighth birthday. I am just the same.

254
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,954
I have not changed much because within Myself

255
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:56,271
 I feel that I have to tell people what they are.

256
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,746
I have to tell them what they can achieve.

257
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:05,811
And, I have to move in such a manner that they see it,

258
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:13,037
 that nothing is important than to know what you are.

259
00:18:13,236 --> 00:18:16,208
You are rich, poor – doesn’t matter.

260
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:18,042
Nothing matters.

261
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,089
What is important is to know yourself.

262
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,235
I’m surprised very little has been written

263
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,735
so far, but I find Tao by Lao Tse.

264
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,472
I don’t know if you have read the book of Lao Tse,

265
00:18:31,703 --> 00:18:36,518
 about Tao and meaning that what you are.

266
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,245
Tao means what you are, and he describes

267
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:45,896
very nicely that when you are that what happens.

268
00:18:46,102 --> 00:18:49,499
Now, the gap was how to achieve that state,

269
00:18:49,603 --> 00:18:53,295
 how to reach that state was not given. He only described

270
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,746
 people who were Tao, who were realized souls,

271
00:18:57,849 --> 00:19:00,912
who were of what level [UNCLEAR] and

272
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,682
I was surprised that he never said about kundalini,

273
00:19:04,912 --> 00:19:07,525
but he talked about the river, Yangtse.

274
00:19:07,641 --> 00:19:11,910
That it is Yangtse river, you see in a symbolic way, he was more poetic.

275
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,715
But ultimately reaching the ocean, that river becomes the ocean

276
00:19:17,343 --> 00:19:20,299
and then what are the qualities of the ocean

277
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:22,519
 he described so beautifully.

278
00:19:23,018 --> 00:19:27,387
Now, I would say you all have become supposing the ocean.

279
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:30,130
So, are you behaving like the ocean?

280
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:35,230
Are you understanding your capacity to be an ocean?

281
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:38,750
What is an ocean is: look at the ocean,

282
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,380
 it has its own boundaries, maryadas, it doesn’t cross.

283
00:19:43,491 --> 00:19:47,018
If you try to push it one side, it will come outside.

284
00:19:47,222 --> 00:19:51,167
So you are, you have to be in your marayadas.

285
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:54,183
We can call it also in your balance. That’s very important

286
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,830
 that you should be in your balance.

287
00:19:56,983 --> 00:20:00,375
Now many people say who have given up smoking

288
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:05,426
have again started smoking, 
who have given up drinking again have started drinking.

289
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,087
That means you have lost your maryadas.

290
00:20:08,237 --> 00:20:12,477
So those maryadas must be watched, watched yourself.

291
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,826
If you go on watching yourself you will know what you are.

292
00:20:16,251 --> 00:20:18,112
You must watch yourself.

293
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:20,060
You call him, “Hello Mister.

294
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,000
So now, what are you up to?”

295
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:25,295
Then you will see how your mind is working.

296
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:29,343
With that thing what happens that this ocean,

297
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:34,139
which is the love of Divinity, just starts flowing.

298
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:37,781
Now this ocean, perhaps you don’t know,

299
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,178
that ocean is the lowest thing.

300
00:20:41,534 --> 00:20:45,566
We measure all the heights from the ocean.

301
00:20:45,732 --> 00:20:49,139
If the ocean is at a zero point, what is the height of Himalaya?

302
00:20:49,521 --> 00:20:52,310
So, it keeps at the lowest.

303
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,616
Because being the lowest it receives all the waters,

304
00:20:56,735 --> 00:21:01,233
all the things that are coming from the rivers or from the rain.

305
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:06,212
Then, it burns its body in the sun – it’s open.

306
00:21:06,792 --> 00:21:09,946
And, when it burns it creates those clouds.

307
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:16,179
And, the whole circle is created that 
these clouds can go and shower rain on people

308
00:21:16,446 --> 00:21:20,117
and again they become rivers and they come back to the sea.

309
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:24,120
Everything has to go to the sea because it is the lowest.

310
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,380
So, you stand at the lowest point with your confidence.

311
00:21:30,525 --> 00:21:32,114
At the lowest point.

312
00:21:32,313 --> 00:21:36,214
Don’t compare yourself with another person who is

313
00:21:36,302 --> 00:21:39,242
who is doing very well in life or may be something.

314
00:21:39,306 --> 00:21:41,856
But see that you are the lowest.

315
00:21:41,943 --> 00:21:47,091
At the lowest point you stand and you will be amazed

316
00:21:47,226 --> 00:21:50,227
that everything will come to you.

317
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:54,606
Everything you will see that it flows into you.

318
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:59,477
Main thing is knowing thyself itself it means

319
00:21:59,588 --> 00:22:02,663
that you know that you are the highest.

320
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:09,773
Now, all that is done just because I cannot contain Myself.

321
00:22:10,048 --> 00:22:13,476
All this kind of miseries and troubles they have.

322
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:16,039
Like Orissa, I prayed so much.

323
00:22:16,508 --> 00:22:19,078
Because it’s a country very much troubled.

324
00:22:19,242 --> 00:22:22,049
We should find out why it is so much troubled.

325
00:22:22,275 --> 00:22:23,902
What is the problem there?

326
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:27,963
And, I tell you, it is a very great country, Orissa is.

327
00:22:28,011 --> 00:22:36,538
I visited it also and main thing missing
there is that still have no confidence.

328
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:43,210
If they develop Sahaja Yoga within themselves,

329
00:22:43,694 --> 00:22:49,667
no flex can come, no problems can come to that country.

330
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:55,749
Same in our country, same in your country and everybody’s country.

331
00:22:55,971 --> 00:23:00,799
First of all, we must have much more Sahaja Yogis,

332
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:05,286
and we must have Sahaja Yogis who know they are Sahaja Yogis.

333
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:12,622
To be very much confident of the fact that after all you are Sahaja Yogis.

334
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,138
And why not?

335
00:23:14,263 --> 00:23:17,244
Whatever I can do, you all can do it also. Why not?

336
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:20,113
You are My children. You can do it.

337
00:23:20,262 --> 00:23:24,142
But the confidence should be there that as

338
00:23:24,365 --> 00:23:29,821
Mother is we could be the same without any ego coming in,

339
00:23:29,964 --> 00:23:33,660
 because mostly I have seen people very afraid of their ego.

340
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:37,554
There is no ego in it because you are like the ocean, I said,

341
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:40,467
which stands at the lowest point.

342
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:43,169
In the same way, it works out.

343
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,966
It’s so beautiful to love the whole world.

344
00:23:46,094 --> 00:23:51,248
It’s so beautiful to enjoy your compassion, to enjoy your generosity.

345
00:23:51,573 --> 00:23:54,612
I enjoy My generosity much more than anything else.

346
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:59,511
But in that generosity, I know that I am not doing anything.

347
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:04,318
It’s just expression of My sense of joy.

348
00:24:04,564 --> 00:24:07,416
You see, I see flowers, I am very happy.

349
00:24:07,582 --> 00:24:12,397
In the same way, I give something to someone, I feel very joyous.

350
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:16,110
It’s a joy, joy giving quality.

351
00:24:16,393 --> 00:24:19,646
And, all joy giving qualities are within you

352
00:24:19,821 --> 00:24:24,783
which you should discover. 
You have got also peace giving qualities.

353
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,963
Such a lot of peace is within you which you can transmit

354
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:32,611
to the atmosphere, to the people, to everyone

355
00:24:32,699 --> 00:24:35,468
 in case your peace is established.

356
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:42,373
If there is anger, temper, this, that, it won’t work out.

357
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:48,950
So, you should watch yourself, you should see yourself, you should meditate

358
00:24:49,094 --> 00:24:53,184
and findout what is lacking.

359
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:59,659
It is such a tremendous force I think sitting before Me.

360
00:25:01,728 --> 00:25:05,883
They can explode all the myths of the world.

361
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:07,494
I know that.

362
00:25:07,863 --> 00:25:13,065
But I don’t know how to ignite, what to do, how to tell them.

363
00:25:13,271 --> 00:25:16,665
So, now I would again and again tell you one thing,

364
00:25:16,816 --> 00:25:21,319
that on this birthday if you really want to give Me something

365
00:25:21,509 --> 00:25:26,125
 then give Me this, that you show your confidence

366
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,734
 and you work it out wherever you are.

367
00:25:28,922 --> 00:25:30,663
You don’t have to change atmosphere.

368
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:32,384
You don’t have to change anything.

369
00:25:32,528 --> 00:25:36,844
Wherever you are with honesty, with sincerity

370
00:25:36,924 --> 00:25:42,824
and with humble nature you can really do a lot.

371
00:25:43,657 --> 00:25:48,043
In every country you can do it, and in the whole world you can do it.

372
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:53,313
This is My greatest desire and I hope,

373
00:25:53,456 --> 00:25:57,802
I am a person who is desireless, you will fulfill this

374
00:25:57,913 --> 00:26:02,648
 subtle desire I have that we should transform the world.

375
00:26:02,915 --> 00:26:04,635
May God Bless you.
