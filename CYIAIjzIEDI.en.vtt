00:21.421 --> 00:28.492
Christ’s work was very unique. The whole
thing was a very unique thing,

00:29.521 --> 00:36.695
was planned in such a manner. Because
He was to be born

00:36.896 --> 00:43.422
in a place, it was very humble, very humble
place.

00:43.623 --> 00:49.484
Because He came to teach us humility.

00:49.685 --> 00:57.547
The word ‘teaching’ in English language
means telling about it, talking about it.

00:59.201 --> 01:09.326
But when I say ‘teach’ I mean create,
you activate within us humility.

01:09.527 --> 01:16.493
Actually He came on this earth first
of all,

01:18.235 --> 01:24.889
to create a space within us, at the Agnya
chakra,

01:25.725 --> 01:33.545
by removing the hurdles of the ego, hurdles
of the ego.

01:35.629 --> 01:39.459
He had to talk of humility that time,

01:39.964 --> 01:48.186
because Romans were ruling and they were
very arrogant, very crude,

01:48.662 --> 01:54.029
uncouth, underdeveloped, we should say,
not at all evolved.

01:56.252 --> 02:03.475
So, this ego of Romans affected everyone
whom they ruled

02:03.676 --> 02:09.216
because when you have somebody as an ideal
before you

02:09.442 --> 02:17.201
and always people see who dominates them
and then such person becomes their ideal.

02:17.402 --> 02:23.100
So you start imbibing that kind
of a character within yourself.

02:27.076 --> 02:32.404
In those circumstances, Christ was born.
But He was not only born

02:32.604 --> 02:37.147
just for Romans or for anyone, but He was
born for the whole world.

02:37.348 --> 02:42.451
Because ego had started growing in human
beings at that time

02:42.652 --> 02:48.167
and had developed quite a lot as far
as the Romans were concerned.

02:48.605 --> 02:54.506
And that demarcated the way human beings
were going on.

02:54.707 --> 03:01.170
So they had to be controlled, first of all,

03:01.371 --> 03:10.756
and Christ had to come at a time where
a balance was to be established.

03:14.519 --> 03:17.948
So the first thing that was said about
Christ throughout in all these music

03:18.149 --> 03:23.615
and songs you have heard now is that
‘Peace on Earth.’

03:26.636 --> 03:30.873
He came to create peace on earth.

03:32.807 --> 03:38.764
That’s only possible when you are
in balance, first of all,

03:38.965 --> 03:44.709
secondly, when you are realized. Both
things should be there.

03:44.910 --> 03:52.162
If only you get your realization and there
is no balance in you, there cannot be peace.

03:52.363 --> 04:00.607
But peace never means in any way is
a personality that recedes back,

04:00.808 --> 04:05.217
runs away from situations, escapists,

04:05.418 --> 04:10.868
which does not want to face the reality,
never means that.

04:11.194 --> 04:18.053
Christ is pictured very differently from
what He was.

04:19.069 --> 04:25.157
He was the strongest personality...,
and the healthiest man...

04:27.108 --> 04:33.134
and He would not stand any nonsense, nobody
could take liberties with Him.

04:33.335 --> 04:37.798
But He would not Himself take liberties
with others, of course no question.

04:37.999 --> 04:44.509
Extremely compassionate, extremely kind
but very powerful.

04:44.725 --> 04:47.868
This is the balance.

04:51.655 --> 04:55.806
So He came on this earth to create peace
within our minds.

04:56.007 --> 04:59.853
On this earth there is no peace, why?
What’s wrong?

05:00.054 --> 05:02.782
It’s only the human beings are not
peaceful.

05:02.983 --> 05:09.876
When is this peace going to be settled
within yourself? Who is violent?

05:10.343 --> 05:14.290
Human beings are violent to each other.

05:15.937 --> 05:20.540
Ego developed subtler ways and subtler
ways,

05:20.741 --> 05:27.901
then provocative ways started coming up
also from the superego.

05:28.174 --> 05:33.675
Sly methods from the superego. The conflict
started.

05:36.054 --> 05:46.416
And at that time, to overcome that
conflict, the best thing was

05:46.862 --> 05:53.174
to create a space in Agnya, in the center,
in thoughtless awareness.

05:54.484 --> 05:58.393
That’s how Christ had to come on this
earth.

05:59.110 --> 06:04.776
The birth is very, very symbolic.

06:06.375 --> 06:15.041
Because He’s nothing but Chaitanya, He’s
nothing but the Word as you call it,

06:15.242 --> 06:20.432
Logos, I don’t know what all words you
have got in language.

06:20.633 --> 06:25.104
The Shabda as they call it, the Omkara.

06:25.305 --> 06:31.901
He was to be born in this way because
He had no body.

06:37.265 --> 06:40.854
And the subtlest of subtle He had to be.

06:41.359 --> 06:49.627
Because the work was very subtle, Sukshma,
that’s why He was born like that.

06:49.946 --> 06:56.073
It’s very poetic to see Him lying down
in a manger for people, just look at this.

06:58.187 --> 07:04.667
Now see, a little child put in the manger,
no comfort,

07:04.868 --> 07:10.309
can there be a comfort in a manger? Think
like that.

07:10.510 --> 07:15.231
All the Christian nations are after their
comforts.

07:17.728 --> 07:20.458
Aren’t we?

07:20.988 --> 07:26.278
What we think is not comfortable, should be
comfortable.

07:26.479 --> 07:30.568
Christians should never seek comfort, that
is one of the messages

07:30.769 --> 07:34.300
of Christ’s birth.

07:37.018 --> 07:40.525
If they seek comfort then they are away
from Christ.

07:40.726 --> 07:44.295
Because He was born in a manger.

07:45.045 --> 07:49.118
No comfort was provided for Him.

07:52.077 --> 07:57.248
But that doesn’t mean that you should
assume some sort of a funny habitation,

07:57.449 --> 08:01.701
it doesn’t mean that also, I mean I have
to tell the other side of it, you see.

08:01.902 --> 08:08.162
Copying Him is not the way. Is not the way
by copying Him that you will become Christ

08:08.363 --> 08:11.465
but by imbibing His qualities within you.

08:12.720 --> 08:16.871
It’s a very, very concrete thing I wanted
to tell you today.

08:17.072 --> 08:21.340
It’s nice to talk of Christ’s birth, be
happy about it, sing songs,

08:21.541 --> 08:24.762
go into a mood like that, but really I tell
you

08:24.963 --> 08:28.777
it’s a very symbolic thing for all of us

08:28.994 --> 08:34.644
to know that He slept, in a manger.

08:36.270 --> 08:40.417
What about Christ within us?

08:41.552 --> 08:46.208
You’re not going to be happy with yourself,

08:47.138 --> 08:50.108
with your being, with your Spirit,

08:50.309 --> 08:57.005
unless and until you create a manger
of very soft thistles.

09:01.456 --> 09:05.021
You yourself you’re not going to enjoy.

09:07.002 --> 09:11.677
We are creating a beautiful manger
for Christ,

09:12.941 --> 09:19.349
to create the peace on earth. We have to be
peaceful,

09:20.479 --> 09:27.937
to be peaceful one has to be humble,
this is the message of Christ, humble.

09:29.543 --> 09:33.888
If you become humble peace will come.

09:34.370 --> 09:39.145
Humble is a good word, I don’t know if
it explains what it means.

09:40.643 --> 09:46.966
Humble means not asking for your own
comfort but comfort of others.

09:47.753 --> 09:54.052
And Christ came on this Earth to expand
your present.

09:54.253 --> 10:05.721
So Christ who is the present Christ, today,
who is born in you, is to be looked after,

10:06.597 --> 10:11.616
is not the Christ of the Bible, but
a Christ of your heart,

10:11.817 --> 10:16.111
which is born within you is to be looked
after.

10:19.615 --> 10:25.389
Bible is so symbolic that it will take
years and years

10:25.590 --> 10:30.133
for people to understand it, it’s too
symbolic for you,

10:30.338 --> 10:38.422
but, at least you can understand it, but
other human beings cannot understand it,

10:39.806 --> 10:43.130
so one has to only understand through your
own Spirit,

10:43.338 --> 10:48.416
that is the Christ born within you, which
must be looked after.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.000
May God bless you.
