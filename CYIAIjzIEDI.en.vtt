00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:28.492
Christ’s work was very unique. The whole
thing was a very unique thing,

00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:36.695
was planned in such a manner. Because
He was to be born

00:00:36.896 --> 00:00:43.422
in a place, it was very humble, very humble
place.

00:00:43.623 --> 00:00:49.484
Because He came to teach us humility.

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:57.547
The word ‘teaching’ in English language
means telling about it, talking about it.

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:09.326
But when I say ‘teach’ I mean create,
you activate within us humility.

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:16.493
Actually He came on this earth first
of all,

00:01:18.235 --> 00:01:24.889
to create a space within us, at the Agnya
chakra,

00:01:25.725 --> 00:01:33.545
by removing the hurdles of the ego, hurdles
of the ego.

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:39.459
He had to talk of humility that time,

00:01:39.964 --> 00:01:48.186
because Romans were ruling and they were
very arrogant, very crude,

00:01:48.662 --> 00:01:54.029
uncouth, underdeveloped, we should say,
not at all evolved.

00:01:56.252 --> 00:02:03.475
So, this ego of Romans affected everyone
whom they ruled

00:02:03.676 --> 00:02:09.216
because when you have somebody as an ideal
before you

00:02:09.442 --> 00:02:17.201
and always people see who dominates them
and then such person becomes their ideal.

00:02:17.402 --> 00:02:23.100
So you start imbibing that kind
of a character within yourself.

00:02:27.076 --> 00:02:32.404
In those circumstances, Christ was born.
But He was not only born

00:02:32.604 --> 00:02:37.147
just for Romans or for anyone, but He was
born for the whole world.

00:02:37.348 --> 00:02:42.451
Because ego had started growing in human
beings at that time

00:02:42.652 --> 00:02:48.167
and had developed quite a lot as far
as the Romans were concerned.

00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:54.506
And that demarcated the way human beings
were going on.

00:02:54.707 --> 00:03:01.170
So they had to be controlled, first of all,

00:03:01.371 --> 00:03:10.756
and Christ had to come at a time where
a balance was to be established.

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.948
So the first thing that was said about
Christ throughout in all these music

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:23.615
and songs you have heard now is that
‘Peace on Earth.’

00:03:26.636 --> 00:03:30.873
He came to create peace on earth.

00:03:32.807 --> 00:03:38.764
That’s only possible when you are
in balance, first of all,

00:03:38.965 --> 00:03:44.709
secondly, when you are realized. Both
things should be there.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:52.162
If only you get your realization and there
is no balance in you, there cannot be peace.

00:03:52.363 --> 00:04:00.607
But peace never means in any way is
a personality that recedes back,

00:04:00.808 --> 00:04:05.217
runs away from situations, escapists,

00:04:05.418 --> 00:04:10.868
which does not want to face the reality,
never means that.

00:04:11.194 --> 00:04:18.053
Christ is pictured very differently from
what He was.

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:25.157
He was the strongest personality...,
and the healthiest man...

00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:33.134
and He would not stand any nonsense, nobody
could take liberties with Him.

00:04:33.335 --> 00:04:37.798
But He would not Himself take liberties
with others, of course no question.

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:44.509
Extremely compassionate, extremely kind 
but very powerful.

00:04:44.725 --> 00:04:47.868
This is the balance.

00:04:51.655 --> 00:04:55.806
So He came on this earth to create peace
within our minds.

00:04:56.007 --> 00:04:59.853
On this earth there is no peace, why?
What’s wrong?

00:05:00.054 --> 00:05:02.782
It’s only the human beings are not
peaceful.

00:05:02.983 --> 00:05:09.876
When is this peace going to be settled
within yourself? Who is violent?

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:14.290
Human beings are violent to each other.

00:05:15.937 --> 00:05:20.540
Ego developed subtler ways and subtler
ways,

00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:27.901
then provocative ways started coming up
also from the superego.

00:05:28.174 --> 00:05:33.675
Sly methods from the superego. The conflict
started.

00:05:36.054 --> 00:05:46.416
And at that time, to overcome that
conflict, the best thing was

00:05:46.862 --> 00:05:53.174
to create a space in Agnya, in the center,
in thoughtless awareness.

00:05:54.484 --> 00:05:58.393
That’s how Christ had to come on this
earth.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.776
The birth is very, very symbolic.

00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:15.041
Because He’s nothing but Chaitanya, He’s
nothing but the Word as you call it,

00:06:15.242 --> 00:06:20.432
Logos, I don’t know what all words you
have got in language.

00:06:20.633 --> 00:06:25.104
The Shabda as they call it, the Omkara.

00:06:25.305 --> 00:06:31.901
He was to be born in this way because
He had no body.

00:06:37.265 --> 00:06:40.854
And the subtlest of subtle He had to be.

00:06:41.359 --> 00:06:49.627
Because the work was very subtle, Sukshma,
that’s why He was born like that.

00:06:49.946 --> 00:06:56.073
It’s very poetic to see Him lying down
in a manger for people, just look at this.

00:06:58.187 --> 00:07:04.667
Now see, a little child put in the manger,
no comfort,

00:07:04.868 --> 00:07:10.309
can there be a comfort in a manger? Think
like that.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:15.231
All the Christian nations are after their
comforts.

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:20.458
Aren’t we?

00:07:20.988 --> 00:07:26.278
What we think is not comfortable, should be
comfortable.

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:30.568
Christians should never seek comfort, that
is one of the messages

00:07:30.769 --> 00:07:34.300
of Christ’s birth.

00:07:37.018 --> 00:07:40.525
If they seek comfort then they are away
from Christ.

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:44.295
Because He was born in a manger.

00:07:45.045 --> 00:07:49.118
No comfort was provided for Him.

00:07:52.077 --> 00:07:57.248
But that doesn’t mean that you should
assume some sort of a funny habitation,

00:07:57.449 --> 00:08:01.701
it doesn’t mean that also, I mean I have
to tell the other side of it, you see.

00:08:01.902 --> 00:08:08.162
Copying Him is not the way. Is not the way
by copying Him that you will become Christ

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:11.465
but by imbibing His qualities within you.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.871
It’s a very, very concrete thing I wanted
to tell you today.

00:08:17.072 --> 00:08:21.340
It’s nice to talk of Christ’s birth, be
happy about it, sing songs,

00:08:21.541 --> 00:08:24.762
go into a mood like that, but really I tell
you

00:08:24.963 --> 00:08:28.777
it’s a very symbolic thing for all of us

00:08:28.994 --> 00:08:34.644
to know that He slept, in a manger.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.417
What about Christ within us?

00:08:41.552 --> 00:08:46.208
You’re not going to be happy with yourself,

00:08:47.138 --> 00:08:50.108
with your being, with your Spirit,

00:08:50.309 --> 00:08:57.005
unless and until you create a manger
of very soft thistles.

00:09:01.456 --> 00:09:05.021
You yourself you’re not going to enjoy.

00:09:07.002 --> 00:09:11.677
We are creating a beautiful manger
for Christ,

00:09:12.941 --> 00:09:19.349
to create the peace on earth. We have to be
peaceful,

00:09:20.479 --> 00:09:27.937
to be peaceful one has to be humble,
this is the message of Christ, humble.

00:09:29.543 --> 00:09:33.888
If you become humble peace will come.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:39.145
Humble is a good word, I don’t know if
it explains what it means.

00:09:40.643 --> 00:09:46.966
Humble means not asking for your own
comfort but comfort of others.

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:54.052
And Christ came on this Earth to expand
your present.

00:09:54.253 --> 00:10:05.721
So Christ who is the present Christ, today,
who is born in you, is to be looked after,

00:10:06.597 --> 00:10:11.616
is not the Christ of the Bible, but
a Christ of your heart,

00:10:11.817 --> 00:10:16.111
which is born within you is to be looked
after.

00:10:19.615 --> 00:10:25.389
Bible is so symbolic that it will take
years and years

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:30.133
for people to understand it, it’s too
symbolic for you,

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:38.422
but, at least you can understand it, but
other human beings cannot understand it,

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:43.130
so one has to only understand through your
own Spirit,

00:10:43.338 --> 00:10:48.416
that is the Christ born within you, which
must be looked after.

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.000
May God bless you.
