00:00:06.407 --> 00:00:10.962
Today is the day of embarrassment as it is.

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:15.628
Because the Virgin is in embarrassed condition always,

00:00:15.708 --> 00:00:20.228
She is a bashful personality.
She has to be bashful, you see.

00:00:20.308 --> 00:00:27.462
She is embarrassed to say things
which She does not want to say.

00:00:27.542 --> 00:00:30.295
Of course, that's a very sweet thing,

00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:35.462
even there She is bashful, to
say harsh thing is a horrible stuff.

00:00:35.542 --> 00:00:45.508
So let us worship our virginity within
ourselves. Let us rise up to that point

00:00:46.775 --> 00:00:56.942
to mount that diamond of brilliance of our virginity,

00:00:58.075 --> 00:01:03.308
in the setting of our humility.

00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:14.261
You can be angry with others,
not with Sahaja Yogis, not with Me.

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:20.075
Even with others, when it is absolutely required.

00:01:21.975 --> 00:01:26.309
But if you fight among yourselves,
and tell people about Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:29.323
nobody is going to believe you.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.495
And that is why today is the day

00:01:35.575 --> 00:01:45.995
when the Virgin Gauri sat down to worship Shiva.

00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:52.962
She made a Shiva Linga and was
sitting and putting Her sindur on that,

00:01:53.042 --> 00:01:59.228
"That you look after this, which
is the mark of My union with You.

00:01:59.308 --> 00:02:05.395
I leave it to You to look after,
to Shiva. You look after this.

00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:11.562
I surrender to You." For this, thatâ€™s how the Gauri,

00:02:11.642 --> 00:02:16.995
your Kundalini, surrenders to the
Spirit. "Now you look after this connection.

00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:22.295
I forget everything else. I leave
it into Your hands. Lift me up.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:28.029
You raise me up. I forget all that was me before.

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:32.029
Everything I have dropped out. No other desire.

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:37.395
But just lift me higher and higher. Make me Yourself.

00:02:37.475 --> 00:02:42.462
The rest of it is not important. All other
manifestations of these desires are over.

00:02:42.542 --> 00:02:46.628
Now, I am absolutely surrendered to You, my Spirit.

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:51.895
Lift me higher and higher. Higher and higher,

00:02:51.975 --> 00:02:59.475
away from all the things that were not the Spirit.

00:03:00.942 --> 00:03:07.295
Make me complete Spirit, full Spirit."

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:11.762
Forget all that was there.

00:03:11.842 --> 00:03:20.762
That elevation, that ascent

00:03:20.842 --> 00:03:32.495
becomes a fast, quick trip, a very fast ascent.

00:03:32.575 --> 00:03:39.261
Just you can do it if you try at
this moment and every moment

00:03:39.341 --> 00:03:45.562
to give up all that was not the Spirit.

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:49.695
Anything that goes against the Spirit must be given up.

00:03:49.775 --> 00:03:53.995
And that is what is the pure desire,

00:03:54.075 --> 00:03:58.261
that's what it is the Kundalini, is the Virgin.

00:03:58.341 --> 00:04:02.462
Is to be absolutely one with the Spirit.

00:04:02.542 --> 00:04:12.542
All the rest has no meaning, has no value.

00:04:15.475 --> 00:04:20.462
This ascent - whatever may be your position,

00:04:20.542 --> 00:04:24.295
to whomsoever you may be
married, wherever you are working,

00:04:24.375 --> 00:04:28.228
whatever is your situation, whatever may be your country,

00:04:28.308 --> 00:04:35.695
you are the Spirit. And if you are raised aloft,

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:47.829
you will dwell in the beautiful kingdom
of God, where all ugliness drops out.

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:56.295
Like when the lotus opens out,
all the mud drops out, completely.

00:04:56.375 --> 00:05:01.795
In the same way, let My children become the fragrant,

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:06.380
beautiful offerings of Sadashiva.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.758
May God bless you.
