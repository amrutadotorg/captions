Ganapatipule India

3
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:23,580
Merry Christmas to you all!

4
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,380
According to Sahaja Yoga,

5
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:35,580
Christ is settled on your Agnya chakra.

6
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:49,860
His whole life is depicting

7
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,940
the qualities of a person

8
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,100
who is a realized soul

9
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,500
and what He has suggested

10
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,740
in His own life is

11
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:23,620
that you should not have any greed or lust.

12
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,140
The way these days people have greedy

13
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:36,060
all over the world is really shocking.

14
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,900
Right from the childhood,

15
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,940
our children also learned

16
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:51,020
to ask for this or ask for that.

17
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,780
Only complete satisfaction in life

18
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,100
can give you that equanimity, that

19
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:11,980
balance by which you do not hanker after things.

20
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:20,300
These days even India has become

21
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,620
very much westernised in the sense

22
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:33,260
they are also very much wanting to have this and that.

23
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:45,180
Actually, now in America, suddenly with this happening,

24
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,740
people are getting to spirituality.

25
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,900
They come to spirituality

26
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:02,820
because they think they have not found any satisfaction anywhere.

27
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,020
But we have to see from His life,

28
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,300
the great life of Christ.

29
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:16,740
First He was born in a small little hut,

30
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,420
as you saw many of them when you come round,

31
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,300
very much satisfied

32
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,060
and He was put in a cradle,

33
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:41,140
which was all covered with dry, very dry grass.

34
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,380
Can you imagine?

35
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:51,260
And then He sacrificed His life on the cross.

36
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:57,500
Whole thing is a story of a sacrifice

37
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,500
because He had a power,

38
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:08,060
power of spirit that He could sacrifice anything.

39
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,540
He even sacrificed His own life.

40
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:19,300
So you can understand the greatness of Christ

41
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:28,740
was coming from His great personality of spirituality.

42
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,860
But the same Christ is worshipped

43
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:46,460
all over the world, specially in the western countries

44
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:53,420
and you'll be amazed to know how they're running after things.

45
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,340
All their industries are running

46
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:01,860
with big stories about what they make

47
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,340
and how people boast of their wealth.

48
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,460
They will have a cross

49
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,660
in their necks to show that they are Christians.

50
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,060
First of all one should never wear that cross

51
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,820
on which Christ was crucified.

52
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,860
But they do make up by this hypocrisy,

53
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:36,220
and they are the another extreme of Christ.

54
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,820
Not only they, but even their wives and their children

55
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,380
are all very greedy people.

56
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,500
They should have this, they should have that.

57
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:57,900
But now India is very much in the same run.

58
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,700
And what do they ask for?

59
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,700
They think by getting all these things around them,

60
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,540
they'll be very comfortable. It's not so.

61
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,980
They're all the time hankering

62
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:22,140
and they cannot even enjoy whatever they have achieved.

63
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,780
It is something very surprising

64
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,620
that in a country like America,

65
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,820
where there was no corruption,

66
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:42,140
but there were people who were making big, big, big money,

67
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:47,260
they are supposed to be disciples of Christ.

68
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,460
It's beyond Me.

69
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,020
India was once upon a time a real

70
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,540
saintly country where saints were respected,

71
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:12,900
but nowadays India has fallen down

72
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:22,020
to such a low level of greed

73
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,540
that impossible to understand these people.

74
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:36,940
We can say they had not such a great following of Christ.

75
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,060
And those who followed Christ, also the Christians here,

76
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,780
they are the worst.

77
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:52,180
They are the ones who have taken to all kinds of western life,

78
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:57,820
of greed, and they call themselves Christians.

79
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:08,860
But Christ has shown that you don't need anything in this world.

80
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:16,500
He's such a great personality, such a great incarnation,

81
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:21,180
respected all everywhere by,

82
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:29,180
because His power of sacrificing was the highest,

83
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:38,260
not because He was owning a big car or any big house, nothing,

84
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,420
only because He was such a humble man.

85
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,180
His life is remarkable.

86
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,940
And that today He governs the hearts of so many,

87
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:03,380
despite the fact He was born a very, very poor man

88
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:09,300
and was crucified also as a very poor man.

89
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:15,260
So those people who are running after

90
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,780
money are no way Christians,

91
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,580
are nowhere near Christ.

92
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,980
And so happy and joyous He was.

93
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,380
And He helped the poor,

94
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,460
He helped the needy

95
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,900
because He understood their problems,

96
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,460
because He could feel them.

97
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:47,340
He tried to help all kinds of diseased people,

98
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,820
underprivileged, while today's

99
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,740
world has come to such a nonsense that they

100
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:00,060
help countries to fight.

101
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,820
They create Christianity to fight.

102
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,620
What is Christianity doing in this country?

103
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:18,260
It's just to create a big power

104
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,060
of creating lots of Christians.

105
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:30,260
I've heard from many places

106
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,300
how they are converting people to Christianity.

107
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,020
Christ never converted even a single soul.

108
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,780
He wanted to give transformation,

109
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,940
as you all have got it,

110
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,260
but not changing the religion

111
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:59,700
or changing your birthmarks, no.

112
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:06,580
And what did He achieve is this kind of a useless

113
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:14,060
third rate people who are running after lust and greed.

114
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,340
I get worried sometimes about Myself,

115
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:25,620
that I hope My disciples and My children

116
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,700
won't do things which are against Sahaj,

117
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,580
which are against the principle of Sahaj.

118
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,420
And one of the principle of Sahaj is

119
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:47,220
that you have to help people, those who are downtrodden,

120
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,980
those who are not yet realized.

121
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,060
You have to give them Realization.

122
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,820
It is not the way world is going on,

123
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:10,380
that we give help to people who are ruining this world.

124
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,780
If we have to save this country,

125
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,900
if you have to save the whole world,

126
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,300
then we have to become like Christ.

127
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,820
Develop your sacrificing temperament.

128
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,980
It should be very, very powerful thing

129
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,460
because you are all realized souls.

130
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:41,060
Try to develop that,

131
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,940
a temperament of helping others.

132
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,380
I've known some very great people in My life

133
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:56,820
who were always willing to give

134
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,900
to people who haven't got it

135
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:06,220
and they have been of such a great

136
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:11,740
temperament they were never sort of

137
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,020
given any big award or anything,

138
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:23,260
but very happy if they could help others.

139
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,700
It's very, very sad today in this country

140
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,060
where so many people have sacrificed their lives to

141
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,780
achieve independence and freedom.

142
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,180
And what is happening is now today,

143
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:50,900
same people or may be their children may be, not the same,

144
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,060
are supposed to be governing,

145
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:59,540
supposed to be in charge, are making money.

146
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,540
Why this situation has come?

147
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,340
In this country also we had

148
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,860
many people who were extremely sacrificing.

149
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,460
They were the leaders.

150
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:20,180
But how many of you are like that?

151
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,780
How many of you would like

152
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,740
to give away something of yours to others?

153
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,020
What would you do to help others?

154
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:41,220
It's very sad that the Christian nations

155
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:48,500
have never followed Christ and we also are becoming the same.

156
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:54,460
I don't say that we should not do business

157
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,540
or we should not make money.

158
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:04,500
You can, but with all that you must remember

159
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,940
for whom are you doing it.

160
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,620
What are you going to do with it?

161
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,900
With this money, what are you going to do?

162
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:23,940
Actually, we should find out at least in one year

163
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:29,020
have we given up one of our things to others.

164
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,340
Not that I say you crucify yourself, no, that's bit too much,

165
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:40,580
but can you at least sacrifice a little bit

166
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,820
of your comfort for the people?

167
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:53,260
Sahaja yogis have to be extremely kind,

168
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,340
extremely kind and loving people.

169
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:01,860
If you are not that, you are not Sahaja yogis.

170
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,540
First thing, you should be kind and loving

171
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:10,940
and understanding the problems around

172
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:16,220
and try to help as many people as you can.

173
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,820
But that is not so.

174
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:26,620
Even Sahaja yogis do not understand

175
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:30,340
what is the value of their life.

176
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:34,020
They are on the same path as Christ was.

177
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,740
They're realized souls.

178
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,660
They must have that feeling.

179
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:46,260
They must have that oneness with the rest of the people

180
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:53,980
and they should feel the sacrifice of Christ within themself.

181
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:00,820
How He sacrificed His life is to improve our Agnya,

182
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:06,340
to remove our ego, to fight our ego.

183
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,780
But we are so egoistical.

184
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:17,980
Whatever He has done is a waste, is something people don't

185
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,340
understand and they do not imbibe

186
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:28,820
His character and His life. It's very bad.

187
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:35,860
For us, He's a very great message

188
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,940
for all the people who are realized souls.

189
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,860
He's a very great example.

190
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:47,860
There are so many things to be done.

191
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:57,860
We have, as you know, My mind is always with the needy

192
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:03,020
and I've started many such organization.

193
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,180
You know them very well.

194
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:11,300
Recently I started something for the destitute women

195
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,220
and the orphans in Delhi.

196
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,220
I paid most of the money

197
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:22,780
but, at just the finishing,

198
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,740
I said "Why not ask Sahaja yogis

199
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,260
to pay that little money to finish?"

200
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,940
and they did, they did pay.

201
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,900
In Delhi, I must congratulate them for showing the way

202
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,460
to other Sahaja yogis.

203
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:46,900
I was amazed how they could raise so much money

204
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:52,180
for this big organization.

205
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,180
It is something we never see,

206
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,940
how the women are suffering in our country,

207
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,940
how the destitute women are suffering.

208
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:15,140
They're left out by their husbands for no fault of theirs, no.

209
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,340
Just like that, for some whim,

210
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,900
they are left on the street with the children.

211
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,620
More in the Muslims it's worse.

212
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:32,540
And I felt very much that I should try to do something,

213
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,140
at least bring the attention of the people

214
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:42,980
to their lot and to their problem so that

215
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:50,140
they come up into life and earn their living.

216
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:57,180
I think it's a duty of all the Sahaja yogis

217
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,300
to go and see around who need your help.

218
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,900
Just don't live for yourself, earning for yourself,

219
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:12,620
making money for yourself, but try to help.

220
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:18,020
Help those people who can really be helped

221
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:23,500
and they should say "Is the Sahaja Yogis who have done for them." 

222
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:29,180
So many ideas I have of helping people

223
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:36,500
and I'm going to try them with whatever money I have,

224
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:45,700
but I wish you could decide to do something for them.

225
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:53,820
Specially this country is divided  into at least two parts,

226
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:58,980
one is the rich, another is the very poor people.

227
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:05,180
These very poor people just make My heart wrench,

228
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:11,060
wrench with pain. I don't know how to help them.

229
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:15,660
It's such a vast community.

230
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,420
But if you people decide, you can go around.

231
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:35,220
You can go around and you can find out

232
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:40,820
ways and method of helping the people

233
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:45,020
who are extremely poor.

234
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:50,060
They need your help by all means

235
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,940
and you are capable.

236
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:59,700
With the Mahalakshmi's blessings, you are well equipped.

237
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,660
And try to help the poor.

238
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:07,660
Try to help the people who are in great trouble.

239
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,340
I know they are not Sahaja yogis,

240
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,540
don't expect them to be Sahaja yogis, they cannot be.

241
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:19,340
At the time of Christ how many there were

242
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,140
who were Sahaja yogis?

243
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:27,020
How many people were there who could understand

244
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:33,020
the depth of human problems.

245
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:40,220
But Christ did and He sacrificed His life

246
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,740
for the sins of the people. Can you imagine?

247
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,740
It's a day to celebrate His birthday with very great joy.

248
00:31:51,940 --> 00:32:00,260
But what a birth and what a life that He had to go through.

249
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:06,660
Nobody would like to have that kind of a life.

250
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:12,220
But the essence of it we must understand.

251
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,700
Running after greed is madness.

252
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,700
There's no end to greed.

253
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,980
Those who are greedy are greedy all the time.

254
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:28,100
They are asking for money, asking for this, asking for that.

255
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,540
Why not see to others, what do they want?

256
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,740
Because we are in collective consciousness

257
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,380
we should understand what do these people want

258
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,180
what can we do for the people.

259
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,100
I know it's very difficult

260
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:59,100
in those modern times with all the advertisements going on,

261
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:06,020
but we are Sahaja yogis. We have to be normal people.

262
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:12,980
We have to face it, in a way that a saint has to face it,

263
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:21,540
and try to eradicate all these ills by your special powers.

264
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,620
Today is a day of great joy to Me and to all of you.

265
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:34,340
Also at the same time, when I see that the life of Christ,

266
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:39,100
such a short life, how miserable it was.

267
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:44,100
Not because of poverty, no,

268
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:50,300
but because of hatred and because of tortures

269
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,020
He had to go through.  He didn't mind poverty,

270
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,060
He didn't write anything about it.

271
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,860
What He felt bad was really

272
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:06,380
the way things are wrong

273
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:13,020
and the way they were oppressed

274
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:20,300
and He took up all that agony onto Himself

275
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:26,180
to solve the problem. He created the Christians

276
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:32,180
and what they are doing is nonsense, just a nonsense.

277
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:37,860
It has no meaning. It has no meaning to Christ's life

278
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:45,180
and it has no meaning to the richness of His great work.

279
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,980
So when we are celebrating His birthday

280
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:56,660
we should also celebrate His sacrificing capacity,

281
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:01,340
His power of loving.

282
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,740
Now Sahaja yogis have become very good people,

283
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:10,060
very loving people, no doubt about it,

284
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,180
but still I think the greed lingers on.

285
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,900
There's no end to greed. I must tell you,

286
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:22,380
I've seen people who are so mad.

287
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:26,940
Like in America, they found out those people

288
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:32,260
at the top of every organization, corporators,

289
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:40,380
who were so rich, but they had twenty-five aeroplanes

290
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,700
and about fifty, over fifty cars.

291
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,340
Are they going to travel

292
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,620
by these fifty cars? How are they going to travel?

293
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:56,700
One foot in one car and another foot in another car?

294
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,700
But they had it, all this kind of madness

295
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:06,540
and they said that - now they have nothing to say,

296
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,380
as such, but now that's all confiscated.

297
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:16,780
What will you do with all this kind of a temperament people?

298
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,100
Isn't it madness to have twenty-five aeroplanes

299
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,060
and about fifty motor cars?

300
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,340
And they thought no end of themselves,

301
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,180
stupid as they were.

302
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:35,940
When they will die, all this will finish.

303
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,540
They're fighting about something in America, such a funny place.

304
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:47,620
There you do understand where are we going with our greed?

305
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:53,260
There's one incident where a very young girl

306
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:58,300
married a very, very old man, very old.

307
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,540
And when this old man died,

308
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:07,700
he left all his money to this young lady.

309
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,140
So the son came over and he made a case

310
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,340
that, "I have been his son for so many years

311
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,700
and how can this lady get all the money?" 

312
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,860
She got billions and billions,

313
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,820
but still she wanted to have the whole,

314
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,260
so she gave excuses

315
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,940
saying, "I have done so much for him.

316
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,980
With this old man,

317
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,220
I have sacrificed so many things,"  and this and that.

318
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,780
It's a shameless thing the way people are

319
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,540
and they're not ashamed

320
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:50,940
that they're asking for money, money, money

321
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,060
for comfort, comfort, comfort.

322
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:59,620
It's very, very difficult to understand human beings.

323
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,300
Once they have gone in a strange way,

324
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,180
they can go to any extent.

325
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:10,900
They don't know how to sacrifice.

326
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:17,380
When I have seen  when Gandhiji asked people to sacrifice,

327
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:22,060
all the women gave away their ornaments.

328
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,460
They gave away their lives.

329
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,380
They went to jail,

330
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:33,420
did all kinds of things to achieve independence.

331
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,180
And what is the independence they got?

332
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:43,420
Immediately all the thugs of the world became in charge.

333
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:47,860
All the thieves of the world became in charge.

334
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:55,340
What do you say to such a country where

335
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:02,460
everything that is great and noble goes into waste?

336
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,660
Have you been a noble person?

337
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:12,460
Ask yourself, have you been noble?

338
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,500
Have you tried to help others?

339
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:22,980
From the life of Christ, we have to know

340
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,820
that He lived in poverty.

341
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:33,180
He was king of kings, but He lived in poverty, with grace,

342
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:44,380
and He did everything for people who were sinful,

343
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:52,500
who were in trouble, such a lot, one person.

344
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:57,860
Now you are so many, so many of you.

345
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,980
You all have to do something.

346
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:08,140
Don't live like these corporators,

347
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:14,580
but try to know that you have to sacrifice

348
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:21,780
something of your earnings, something of your luxuries

349
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,460
for the sake of your country because you are Sahaja yogis.

350
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:33,860
You are not ordinary people.  You have got your Realization.

351
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,900
So what are you doing?

352
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:44,740
Are you demanding money from everyone

353
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,820
or you are giving love to everyone?

354
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:53,820
Let Me hear the stories of Sahaja yogis

355
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:58,820
who are giving love and compassion.

356
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,980
I'm sorry today on the day of His birthday,

357
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:07,100
I have to tell about His life

358
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,860
which was very, very painful otherwise.

359
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:17,820
For us to understand that such a glorious personality,

360
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,300
such a great Sahaja Yogi,

361
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:27,940
He had to go through so many problems in His life

362
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:35,100
and His own people troubled Him.

363
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,900
His own people tried to take advantage.

364
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:45,460
I too have this experience from Sahaja yogis

365
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:50,980
who got well out of Sahaja Yoga and they tried to trouble Me.

366
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,140
They tried to make money out of Me.

367
00:41:54,340 --> 00:42:01,740
Everyone knows they have such a bad value system

368
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,620
that how can you say they are realized souls?

369
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:14,220
So, we have to think where we can help others,

370
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:17,580
what we can do for others.

371
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:25,980
This is one of the things one has to learn from life of Christ.

372
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,620
I was actually born in a Christian family

373
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:35,260
and what I found out among the Christians,

374
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,820
that extremely they were mean, dirty people.

375
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:46,780
They were planning against each other and very money-oriented.

376
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:52,860
When My father went to jail, they threw us out of church.

377
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:58,940
To love your country is a sin, is it? They did it.

378
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,820
And when he came back and he became the mayor of Bombay,

379
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:08,420
of Nagpur, they were his greatest admirers.

380
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,020
They take out a procession, you see.

381
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,580
So My father just smiled at it

382
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,820
and he said,  "See these stupid people." 

383
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:26,420
This is complete stupidity and this kind of greed

384
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:35,020
and this kind of stupidity must be stopped.

385
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,460
They run after money, they run after positions,

386
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:46,180
they run after also very bad things, some of them.

387
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,700
Not the Sahaja yogis, but they do.

388
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,820
But even amongst Sahaja yogis I have found people

389
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:58,220
who are very money-oriented,

390
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,660
and they have made money out of Sahaja Yoga.

391
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:07,860
I am such a useless person, I don't understand money,

392
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:12,900
so they could befool Me. All right, doesn't matter.

393
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:17,460
And for years together, they were befooling Me, it's all right.

394
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:21,500
Now what to do? What do I need money for?

395
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:27,740
That is the trouble. The trouble is if you are not careful,

396
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:30,620
if you are not very money-oriented,

397
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:36,020
others can rob you. I say let them rob.

398
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,340
Let them do what they like,

399
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,740
but I cannot develop a temperament

400
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:47,940
by which I can get after people for money, I cannot.

401
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,100
I accept whatever account you give Me.

402
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,740
I accept whatever you say.

403
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:57,860
I know it is sinful. It is wrong.

404
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:01,980
If they're not aware of it, I can't help it.

405
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,740
They all will be ruined, all such people. I know that.

406
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,500
But what to do, if they don't realize it themselves?

407
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,340
Making money out of Sahaja Yoga, can you imagine?

408
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:22,820
Such a stupid thing to do. It's very common, very bad.

409
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:36,660
I want you all to be above money,

410
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:43,580
to above all these worldly things and you will never starve.

411
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:47,140
You will never have problem.

412
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:56,540
But do not get mixed up with this kind of nonsensical things.

413
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:03,220
This is God's work and you shouldn't make money out of it,

414
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,980
in no way.

415
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:10,060
So we have to learn a lot

416
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,660
from the great life of Christ, who

417
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:18,780
was born as a very humble man

418
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,540
and He did such great things.

419
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:27,700
He tried to improve our Agnyas

420
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:33,900
and even now if you think of Him your Agnya will be all right.

421
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,780
It will be finished

422
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:39,740
I know among Sahaja yogis also there are people

423
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:45,420
who are very pushing, who are all the time pushing themselves.

424
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:50,500
For what? What do you want?

425
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:56,260
All the time they are pushing around

426
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,060
just like all other stupid people.

427
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:06,100
So to feel the satisfaction within yourself,

428
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,500
just like Christ,

429
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,900
you have to meditate

430
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:15,660
and introspect and find out,

431
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,020
"Are you satisfied people?"

432
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:23,260
You have to be very much satisfied in life,

433
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:27,860
otherwise no use having Sahaja Yoga,

434
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:33,020
no use getting your Self-realization.

435
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:36,140
I bless you from My heart

436
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:40,860
that you take the character of Christ

437
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:47,140
as a model for you and to understand

438
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:52,060
the problems of the world, from the whole world,

439
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,900
as your own problems.

440
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:58,100
May God bless you!
