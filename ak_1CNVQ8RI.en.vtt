00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:09.838
I am happy to know so many of you have come
here and I feel this is a very important puja,

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:15.717
not only for Australia but for the whole world,
because it has the greatest message which

00:02:15.717 --> 00:02:19.728
we have actualized now in Sahaja yoga.

00:02:19.728 --> 00:02:25.468
We have to understand the message of Christ.

00:02:25.468 --> 00:02:30.788
There are many people in this world who try
to show off that they are very great rationalists

00:02:30.788 --> 00:02:38.388
and that they have a right to pass any remark
they like about Christ.

00:02:38.388 --> 00:02:42.188
I was reading the newspapers today.

00:02:42.188 --> 00:02:52.848
I was surprised where they are all saying
one by one that, "I reject this part of Christ

00:02:52.848 --> 00:02:55.488
that He was born with Immaculate Conception.

00:02:55.488 --> 00:02:58.128
I reject that He was resurrected.

00:02:58.128 --> 00:03:00.997
I reject this and I reject that."

00:03:00.997 --> 00:03:02.677
Who are you?

00:03:02.677 --> 00:03:13.538
Because you can write, because you have a
flair, how can you say such things?

00:03:13.538 --> 00:03:15.408
Just without finding out.

00:03:15.408 --> 00:03:20.668
You are a scholar, maybe you are very well
read, maybe that you think you are capable

00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:29.598
of saying whatever you like about any subject,
but subject of spirituality cannot be dealt

00:03:29.598 --> 00:03:34.498
by people who are not even self-realized.

00:03:34.498 --> 00:03:41.018
Because it's a very divine life, it's a very
different life.

00:03:41.018 --> 00:03:47.757
It's a area where your mind cannot enter.

00:03:47.757 --> 00:03:52.938
It is beyond the mind.

00:03:52.938 --> 00:04:01.578
And so the poets or artists, all of them who
have worked on Christ's life and have tried

00:04:01.578 --> 00:04:09.018
to say things about Him, mostly were realized
souls and if they were not, they could not

00:04:09.018 --> 00:04:11.978
do any justice to His life.

00:04:11.978 --> 00:04:20.447
It's very surprising that I should be celebrating
this resurrection in Australia.

00:04:20.447 --> 00:04:34.048
You know this is the country of mooladhara,
and mooladhara itself then expresses itself

00:04:34.048 --> 00:04:38.508
or manifests in the agnya.

00:04:38.508 --> 00:04:53.928
So, such a great connection you have that
first of all is the country where mooladhara

00:04:53.928 --> 00:05:00.828
is established, was established I should say,
and later on that it was manifested in the

00:05:00.828 --> 00:05:06.358
life of Christ on the agnya center.

00:05:06.358 --> 00:05:16.508
I must say that you have really created some
very great people signifying this beautiful

00:05:16.508 --> 00:05:25.837
manifestation because, as you have Dr. Bogdan
who is an Australian, in the sense that he

00:05:25.837 --> 00:05:35.478
lived here and then he went back to Russia
which is the right agnya, where he worked.

00:05:35.478 --> 00:05:44.388
In the same way, as Sahaja yoga has prospered
here to begin with, among all the European

00:05:44.388 --> 00:06:03.128
countries, or we can say, among all the countries
which were not Indian, maximum growth took

00:06:03.128 --> 00:06:12.718
place in Australia and the maximum growth
now first took place in the Eastern Bloc,

00:06:12.718 --> 00:06:13.718
in Russia.

00:06:13.718 --> 00:06:20.778
Now the other part of the agnya is China.

00:06:20.778 --> 00:06:30.248
And it is you people only... out of you only
some people have to look after that.

00:06:30.248 --> 00:06:41.447
And as it is you're all looking after Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Thailand.

00:06:41.447 --> 00:06:49.737
All these are Chinese races.

00:06:49.737 --> 00:06:52.857
Apart from that, they worship Buddha.

00:06:52.857 --> 00:06:54.737
It's very interesting.

00:06:54.737 --> 00:07:04.607
Buddha, as you know, is on the left side of
your medha, as they call it, this is the medha

00:07:04.607 --> 00:07:08.368
plate, is the lower plate of the brain.

00:07:08.368 --> 00:07:16.577
So the Christ is in the center and we've got
Buddha on the left side.

00:07:16.577 --> 00:07:24.107
Or, you also are looking after the countries
which are influenced by Buddha.

00:07:24.107 --> 00:07:29.047
It's all working out like a plan.

00:07:29.047 --> 00:07:39.088
Perhaps you're not aware of it, that we are
all people belonging to one Virata and that

00:07:39.088 --> 00:07:49.157
our needs or our work, all of them have great
significance and connection.

00:07:49.157 --> 00:08:03.368
About Australia, there's a myth in India that
there was a big saint and he was very good,

00:08:03.368 --> 00:08:10.248
but somehow he made some mistakes... or maybe
lots of mistakes.

00:08:10.248 --> 00:08:14.717
So God cursed him and said you better go away
from India.

00:08:14.717 --> 00:08:19.097
It was connecting India and Africa.

00:08:19.097 --> 00:08:22.058
So the land was brought down to this point.

00:08:22.058 --> 00:08:29.338
He gave him the land - God - and He said,
"Now you resurrect this land and make something

00:08:29.338 --> 00:08:31.998
out of it."

00:08:31.998 --> 00:08:38.618
And this star is called as this Trishanku
[MEANS As per Indian Mythology, a saint king

00:08:38.618 --> 00:08:40.708
who wished to go to heaven alive, but was
stopped &amp; kept hanging in between by Gods,

00:08:40.708 --> 00:08:42.928
as he was being sent by Sage Vishwamitra,
and then became a star], which is your Southern

00:08:42.928 --> 00:08:43.928
Cross.

00:08:43.928 --> 00:08:48.097
This Southern Cross is called as Trishanku,
as in... mentioned in our Puranas [MEANS One

00:08:48.097 --> 00:08:58.817
type of Indian scriptures] as this saint who
became like that and God made him into a star

00:08:58.817 --> 00:08:59.817
which is hanging.

00:08:59.817 --> 00:09:10.928
Trishanku is hanging on top of this land and
is working out the building up of this country.

00:09:10.928 --> 00:09:18.258
He was told that you go there and make a heaven
for the human beings.

00:09:18.258 --> 00:09:30.187
This has so many mythological and historical
backgrounds.

00:09:30.187 --> 00:09:35.237
And there are some very good points also I
have seen about Australia, which are very

00:09:35.237 --> 00:09:41.947
surprising because they believe in the multi-racial
society and they preserve it.

00:09:41.947 --> 00:09:51.958
They try to help the people through justice
if some people are troubled and tortured.

00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:59.657
It's a very bold attitude towards progress
that we should have multicultural society

00:09:59.657 --> 00:10:10.267
and this comes, again I would say, after resurrection
of political thought.

00:10:10.267 --> 00:10:23.418
America is multicultural society, full of
it, and as a result of that, as a result of

00:10:23.418 --> 00:10:28.878
that they have progressed very much financially.

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:37.917
But they didn't learn anything from the multicultural
society.

00:10:37.917 --> 00:10:41.358
For example, Spanish went there.

00:10:41.358 --> 00:10:44.088
Spanish, as you know, are bullfighters.

00:10:44.088 --> 00:10:53.188
They went and destroyed all the cultures of
the ancient times and the new people who have

00:10:53.188 --> 00:10:56.518
gone, they don't have any rapport with them.

00:10:56.518 --> 00:11:04.238
Like Indians have a separate identity, then
we have other cultures like Islamic and all

00:11:04.238 --> 00:11:08.218
that, so they don't keep any connection with
them.

00:11:08.218 --> 00:11:16.318
The original aboriginals are also kept out
as something very low-level.

00:11:16.318 --> 00:11:24.927
But here I find people have a curiosity and
also knowledge about the other cultures which

00:11:24.927 --> 00:11:27.098
are around them.

00:11:27.098 --> 00:11:39.468
That shows the sense of collectivity is within
your genes, we can say, that it is working

00:11:39.468 --> 00:11:49.117
out in such a way that this country believes
still in the multicultural society.

00:11:49.117 --> 00:11:54.508
All these are manifestation of Shri Ganesha's
quality.

00:11:54.508 --> 00:12:05.287
See if you have, say, a group of even ten
people with husband and wife and they don't

00:12:05.287 --> 00:12:15.247
have the purity of Shri Ganesha, they cannot
exist because there will be always a very

00:12:15.247 --> 00:12:18.478
great conflict between husband and wife.

00:12:18.478 --> 00:12:26.917
Also, not only the conflict part, but people
will become extremely superficial.

00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:37.417
Like, in America a woman would marry a man
because he wears such and such dress; or a

00:12:37.417 --> 00:12:42.778
woman is appreciated because she has a particular
type of hairstyle.

00:12:42.778 --> 00:12:47.598
If the hairstyle changes, the man can ask
for a divorce.

00:12:47.598 --> 00:12:50.747
So superficial they are.

00:12:50.747 --> 00:12:55.698
The fight is with the husband that you didn't
buy a particular coat which I liked, so there's

00:12:55.698 --> 00:12:57.218
a divorce.

00:12:57.218 --> 00:12:59.508
It's so superficial.

00:12:59.508 --> 00:13:07.968
So the relationship between husband and wife
is established by Shri Ganesh and He gives

00:13:07.968 --> 00:13:14.838
you the pure idea about how to enjoy your
married life.

00:13:14.838 --> 00:13:19.868
Why people like Freud become so important?

00:13:19.868 --> 00:13:30.638
They start replacing Christ and people become
enamored by that.

00:13:30.638 --> 00:13:39.778
Because human beings, if they know that in
potential state they are all divine, they

00:13:39.778 --> 00:13:48.357
all have to become divine and not to go down
to the level of animals, even worse than that.

00:13:48.357 --> 00:13:57.588
If they realize it that their main object
of life is resurrection, that they have to

00:13:57.588 --> 00:14:05.568
rise above all these so-called temptations
of life.

00:14:05.568 --> 00:14:22.727
If they know this potential, then they have
to believe in it also, so that they do not

00:14:22.727 --> 00:14:29.198
have these absurd ideas about life.

00:14:29.198 --> 00:14:32.918
As a human being, Christ came.

00:14:32.918 --> 00:14:36.848
He came as a human being, but He was not a
human being.

00:14:36.848 --> 00:14:38.028
He was divine.

00:14:38.028 --> 00:14:40.687
Absolutely He was nothing but Aumkara.

00:14:40.687 --> 00:14:45.208
That's why He could walk on the water.

00:14:45.208 --> 00:14:50.068
There was nothing materialistic in Him, you
can say, no matter in Him.

00:14:50.068 --> 00:14:56.937
If there was any matter, He could not have
walked on the water.

00:14:56.937 --> 00:15:03.968
But if people start discarding all these facts,
about His birth, about His walking on the

00:15:03.968 --> 00:15:12.807
water and all that, then what is left of Christ,
I can't understand.

00:15:12.807 --> 00:15:19.048
Now this message of His resurrection is very
important, but what you find that, as you

00:15:19.048 --> 00:15:22.518
get three days holidays, people are just doing
what one should not do.

00:15:22.518 --> 00:15:31.408
They have gone to some places, maybe with
their wives, may not be with their wives,

00:15:31.408 --> 00:15:40.787
with anybody, into some sort of a rubbish
and they enjoy things which cannot be enjoyed

00:15:40.787 --> 00:15:44.097
by anybody who is a realized soul.

00:15:44.097 --> 00:15:49.258
So we have to know ourself that now we have
got our realization.

00:15:49.258 --> 00:15:50.287
We got it.

00:15:50.287 --> 00:15:55.437
Not that it is in a potential state, but it
is in a kinetic state.

00:15:55.437 --> 00:16:04.028
So, for us Christ should be a model, what
kind of life we should lead.

00:16:04.028 --> 00:16:11.377
In those days of Christ, there were no aeroplanes,
there were no cars, nothing, but He went from

00:16:11.377 --> 00:16:16.377
places to places and talked to them about
spiritual life.

00:16:16.377 --> 00:16:20.727
The people were not yet evolved.

00:16:20.727 --> 00:16:24.357
They were not matured enough.

00:16:24.357 --> 00:16:32.238
So He could not give them realization, but
He talked about dharmic life.

00:16:32.238 --> 00:16:46.528
He went to the extreme of the ten commandments
that He said not only that you should not

00:16:46.528 --> 00:16:50.987
do adultery, but you should not even have
adulterous eyes.

00:16:50.987 --> 00:16:53.198
Pure eyes.

00:16:53.198 --> 00:16:57.228
Now how is it possible?

00:16:57.228 --> 00:17:05.107
When you see Christians and Christian nations,
they suffer from this disease of not having

00:17:05.107 --> 00:17:08.417
at all clean eyes.

00:17:08.417 --> 00:17:16.218
There's a kind of a lust and greed in the
eye and they're not ashamed of it.

00:17:16.218 --> 00:17:25.167
Thank God, Sahaja Yogis all over the world
have changed so much, transformed so much.

00:17:25.167 --> 00:17:29.157
They've become so beautiful that this problem
we don't have.

00:17:29.157 --> 00:17:36.088
And if somebody has it, we want that person
to get out of Sahaja yoga till they cure themselves

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:40.117
and come to normal.

00:17:40.117 --> 00:17:47.497
The main problem of the Christian nation is
that they have become too much mental.

00:17:47.497 --> 00:17:53.698
Even sex they do mentally, in the sense [that]
they flirt.

00:17:53.698 --> 00:18:02.667
The eyes are so much all the time looking
at something and reacting to it.

00:18:02.667 --> 00:18:05.018
They cannot witness anything.

00:18:05.018 --> 00:18:14.247
Anything they'll see they start thinking about
it, react to it.

00:18:14.247 --> 00:18:24.487
Then the reaction, because they are not evolved,
can take them to any level of bestiality - Worse

00:18:24.487 --> 00:18:26.168
than beasts.

00:18:26.168 --> 00:18:38.978
For example, an innocent person sees something,
he goes into thoughtless awareness and he

00:18:38.978 --> 00:18:46.148
just enjoys the beauty of that; but a person
who is full of lust and greed can never enjoy

00:18:46.148 --> 00:18:47.148
anything.

00:18:47.148 --> 00:18:56.968
On the contrary, he would like to possess
that thing or would go beyond limits of his

00:18:56.968 --> 00:19:03.778
authority and enjoy somebody else's wife,
somebody else's husband.

00:19:03.778 --> 00:19:11.138
It's a very subtle thing, which we should
understand when we make friendship with others.

00:19:11.138 --> 00:19:14.838
What do we enjoy in the friendship?

00:19:14.838 --> 00:19:18.918
What do we see in that friendship?

00:19:18.918 --> 00:19:23.257
As realized soul, how your friendship should
be?

00:19:23.257 --> 00:19:26.748
The friendship should be pure - nirvajya.

00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:37.988
That is, you're friendly with somebody because
just you enjoy the pure friendship, where

00:19:37.988 --> 00:19:50.068
there's no sense of possession or also the
sense of destruction.

00:19:50.068 --> 00:19:58.147
Such a friendship is a Sahaj friendship.

00:19:58.147 --> 00:20:05.368
I have seen people all over the world, when
they come to Ganapatipule, the way they laugh,

00:20:05.368 --> 00:20:15.318
the way they enjoy and I feel so happy there's
this new world of such innocent people has

00:20:15.318 --> 00:20:18.468
been created on this Earth in My lifetime.

00:20:18.468 --> 00:20:27.818
You should also realize that you belong now
to a very higher type of people, very higher

00:20:27.818 --> 00:20:28.818
type.

00:20:28.818 --> 00:20:40.838
There's no justification for any Sahaja Yogi
to indulge into such dirty stuff, because

00:20:40.838 --> 00:20:42.108
he is beyond it.

00:20:42.108 --> 00:20:49.257
He has developed a new sense of beauty and
cleanliness.

00:20:49.257 --> 00:20:59.318
He cannot bear anything, which makes him look
like a person who goes towards all kinds of

00:20:59.318 --> 00:21:00.497
filthy things.

00:21:00.497 --> 00:21:08.488
This is a specialty, which you have got it,
which was potentially within you and despite

00:21:08.488 --> 00:21:14.508
the atmosphere in which you lived and you
saw, you just got out of it and became like

00:21:14.508 --> 00:21:19.578
beautiful lotuses in the pond of filth.

00:21:19.578 --> 00:21:30.027
And these lotuses themselves can give such
beautiful fragrance to others that they can

00:21:30.027 --> 00:21:33.338
make the whole pond fragrant and beautiful.

00:21:33.338 --> 00:21:41.878
So the responsibility on you is much more
than, I would say, on Christ because Christ

00:21:41.878 --> 00:21:43.008
was divine.

00:21:43.008 --> 00:21:47.308
I was asking them to get Devi Mahatmyam, if
possible.

00:21:47.308 --> 00:21:57.418
In that He's described as the son of Lord
Krishna and Radhaji and that He has been given

00:21:57.418 --> 00:22:03.867
a special power and is called as a Support
of the Universe.

00:22:03.867 --> 00:22:05.588
Just imagine.

00:22:05.588 --> 00:22:06.588
Mooladhar.

00:22:06.588 --> 00:22:09.157
He is the Support of the Universe.

00:22:09.157 --> 00:22:22.518
And the birth is described in a beautiful
way that first He was created like an egg.

00:22:22.518 --> 00:22:25.918
This purity, this auspiciousness was made
into an egg.

00:22:25.918 --> 00:22:31.048
That's why during Easter you people give eggs
to friends.

00:22:31.048 --> 00:22:43.277
Now this egg was nicely also kept for ages
and then it was broken into two.

00:22:43.277 --> 00:22:52.497
The first one became Shri Ganesha and the
second one, which evolved fully... like an

00:22:52.497 --> 00:23:01.798
egg when it is evolved and is fully mature,
the second one was Christ.

00:23:01.798 --> 00:23:09.628
You may say that, "How is it one egg has two
forms?"

00:23:09.628 --> 00:23:13.418
I must say these are divine happenings.

00:23:13.418 --> 00:23:20.018
They have very different from what we see
in the mundane world.

00:23:20.018 --> 00:23:28.678
Now, this egg, the second part of it, became
a child and He was crying for His Father.

00:23:28.678 --> 00:23:37.708
All His life, Christ talked for His Father
and when He knew He] will be crucified, He

00:23:37.708 --> 00:23:49.588
prayed to His Father saying that "Oh Father,
save Me from this cup of crucifixion," He

00:23:49.588 --> 00:23:50.588
prayed.

00:23:50.588 --> 00:23:58.428
And if you see His two fingers, these two
fingers are always out - expression of His

00:23:58.428 --> 00:23:59.428
blessing.

00:23:59.428 --> 00:24:05.387
This is the one, which stands, as you know
very well, for Shri Krishna, and this one

00:24:05.387 --> 00:24:06.407
for Vishnu.

00:24:06.407 --> 00:24:10.468
So always He showed these two fingers.

00:24:10.468 --> 00:24:20.767
There are so many things by which we can,
as Sahaja Yogis, find out how Christ has been

00:24:20.767 --> 00:24:22.088
ruling throughout.

00:24:22.088 --> 00:24:25.848
He is not dead.

00:24:25.848 --> 00:24:38.367
His body might have been perished in Kashmir,
as they say, but He was the spirit and the

00:24:38.367 --> 00:24:52.918
spirit that was in Him was a living, eternally
living, great personality.

00:24:52.918 --> 00:25:04.367
We may say that He might have had little bit
of, we can say, the human aspect to camouflage

00:25:04.367 --> 00:25:13.527
Himself, after all spirit just cannot come
in, and that might have been dead, that part,

00:25:13.527 --> 00:25:16.928
that camouflage that He was using.

00:25:16.928 --> 00:25:35.308
In divinity, as Ganesha is pure, He is absolutely
beyond any kind of contamination.

00:25:35.308 --> 00:25:40.877
Other incarnations who came on this Earth,
they had to do many things.

00:25:40.877 --> 00:25:48.428
Like Shri Krishna had to go in the war of
Mahabharata.

00:25:48.428 --> 00:25:53.488
Rama had to go in the jungle to deal with
people.

00:25:53.488 --> 00:26:03.838
Same with Christ, we can say, that He did
go to all these places, but He never behaved

00:26:03.838 --> 00:26:04.838
like a human being.

00:26:04.838 --> 00:26:05.838
Others did.

00:26:05.838 --> 00:26:13.058
Shri Rama cried a lot, wept a lot for His
wife.

00:26:13.058 --> 00:26:24.458
Then Shri Krishna married so many times - because
they were His powers so He married them.

00:26:24.458 --> 00:26:29.478
So, though they were incarnations, they had
to very much do the things which human beings

00:26:29.478 --> 00:26:30.478
do.

00:26:30.478 --> 00:26:31.928
Christ was never married.

00:26:31.928 --> 00:26:39.387
He never wept, as far as we know, except when
He was praying to His Father.

00:26:39.387 --> 00:26:48.928
He just asked that "If You could remove this
cup from My mouth I'll be very happy."

00:26:48.928 --> 00:26:53.948
So it's shown in His character that He came
on this Earth as a divine personality, lived

00:26:53.948 --> 00:27:00.507
as a divine personality and died as a divine
personality.

00:27:00.507 --> 00:27:09.938
I think that way it is much easier to be because
you are a divine person, you come, give some

00:27:09.938 --> 00:27:13.808
sermons, lectures, this, that and just go
away.

00:27:13.808 --> 00:27:19.808
He didn't take the responsibility of giving
realization to people, which is the greatest

00:27:19.808 --> 00:27:23.017
headache, I think, to give realizations to
people.

00:27:23.017 --> 00:27:31.178
Because, if you give them the resurrection,
if they get their realization...

00:27:31.178 --> 00:27:36.598
Christ accepted His resurrection as a natural
thing because He knew all about it, and that

00:27:36.598 --> 00:27:37.828
He didn't have to change.

00:27:37.828 --> 00:27:39.098
He didn't have to transform Himself.

00:27:39.098 --> 00:27:45.448
He was the same as He was because He did not
need any resurrection.

00:27:45.448 --> 00:27:52.928
He just tried to show in His life that we
human beings can have our realization and

00:27:52.928 --> 00:27:53.958
we can be resurrected.

00:27:53.958 --> 00:28:02.818
His message is not the cross but the resurrection
and this resurrection if you understand, then

00:28:02.818 --> 00:28:11.558
one can understand also one more thing - that
we are now resurrected from ordinary human

00:28:11.558 --> 00:28:14.517
beings to the divine level.

00:28:14.517 --> 00:28:22.497
It was easier for Christ because He didn't
have to face any problems, while you are coming

00:28:22.497 --> 00:28:30.168
out of that human life to a such a higher
life.

00:28:30.168 --> 00:28:32.848
Suddenly, it is too much.

00:28:32.848 --> 00:28:34.038
I agree.

00:28:34.038 --> 00:28:38.348
It is too much to accept.

00:28:38.348 --> 00:28:51.468
But because you go beyond your mind, it's
not difficult - because your mind stops thinking.

00:28:51.468 --> 00:28:57.858
Otherwise, normally people would have been
thinking, "Now, I am resurrected.

00:28:57.858 --> 00:28:58.858
All right.

00:28:58.858 --> 00:29:01.147
So what should I do?

00:29:01.147 --> 00:29:03.497
What should I drop out?

00:29:03.497 --> 00:29:05.288
What things should go away?

00:29:05.288 --> 00:29:07.998
What is the goal?"

00:29:07.998 --> 00:29:12.308
All these ideas of human beings would have
followed you slowly.

00:29:12.308 --> 00:29:17.887
But no, you just felt, "We are there.

00:29:17.887 --> 00:29:20.928
Now what to do?

00:29:20.928 --> 00:29:23.208
We are there."

00:29:23.208 --> 00:29:30.708
You became conscious of your qualities, of
your virtues, of your greatness and those

00:29:30.708 --> 00:29:38.838
who were conscious became very confident that
we have these values already existing within

00:29:38.838 --> 00:29:47.548
us; we have these powers, which are manifesting
and these powers are flowing through us.

00:29:47.548 --> 00:29:48.887
Nobody doubted it.

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:51.257
Some did, but very few.

00:29:51.257 --> 00:29:57.497
As you grew up, immediately you knew that
the Divine is acting through you.

00:29:57.497 --> 00:29:59.098
Is there.

00:29:59.098 --> 00:30:00.098
Everything is tangible.

00:30:00.098 --> 00:30:02.998
You know everything about your inner being.

00:30:02.998 --> 00:30:11.298
Gradually, you start spreading out your self,
spreading out your personality.

00:30:11.298 --> 00:30:16.378
And then you don't have the weaknesses as
human beings have.

00:30:16.378 --> 00:30:18.897
We had some funny people, no doubt.

00:30:18.897 --> 00:30:23.407
I know that people start thinking about how
to make money out of Sahaja Yoga, - and that's

00:30:23.407 --> 00:30:31.978
still a human nonsense going on - or how to
show your powers, how to show how your powers

00:30:31.978 --> 00:30:43.188
can assert, how to sort of use your ego to
put down people.

00:30:43.188 --> 00:30:55.828
All these are human style of lives and it
existed for some time, but now I find you

00:30:55.828 --> 00:31:01.647
all are washed as if through this kundalini
has just washed you completely.

00:31:01.647 --> 00:31:02.979
You all have become very beautiful people,
extremely beautiful, and even people... they

00:31:02.979 --> 00:31:08.798
see you at the airport and they think that
these are some unique people.

00:31:08.798 --> 00:31:15.398
Even in this area when we came, they were
telling Me that... the gentleman who is the

00:31:15.398 --> 00:31:24.188
caretaker was saying that he has never seen
such a group - "They don't fight; they don't

00:31:24.188 --> 00:31:29.117
argue; they don't make money; the children
are so sweet.

00:31:29.117 --> 00:31:38.267
It's remarkable, such a society in these modern
times never existed anywhere and how is it,

00:31:38.267 --> 00:31:39.558
it is existing here?"

00:31:39.558 --> 00:31:46.188
They were quite surprised as, also you should
be, that you have achieved this without any

00:31:46.188 --> 00:31:52.448
much effort or any penance or going to Himalayas.

00:31:52.448 --> 00:31:56.228
You got it because it was all there.

00:31:56.228 --> 00:31:58.907
It was all there and you found it.

00:31:58.907 --> 00:32:00.918
Our marriages are, ninety percent are successful.

00:32:00.918 --> 00:32:09.358
We have problems from the parents sometimes,
from the society, but it's too little to be

00:32:09.358 --> 00:32:20.777
mentioned and it makes one sense to Me - that
we can really change this world.

00:32:20.777 --> 00:32:23.548
No doubt about it.

00:32:23.548 --> 00:32:30.198
If you remember that the message of Christ
is resurrection, that has already happened.

00:32:30.198 --> 00:32:33.718
Now, after resurrection what?

00:32:33.718 --> 00:32:36.647
Your attention should be there.

00:32:36.647 --> 00:32:41.257
If it is still on your job, on your money,
on your car, your house, this, that, then

00:32:41.257 --> 00:32:44.608
you are still a human being.

00:32:44.608 --> 00:32:49.358
You have not yet lost that attachment.

00:32:49.358 --> 00:32:54.157
Or on your children and your spouses and all.

00:32:54.157 --> 00:32:58.818
That is all being still absolutely human.

00:32:58.818 --> 00:33:05.318
But a person who is divine has all the relations
but doesn't get attached and involved into.

00:33:05.318 --> 00:33:11.527
I've given many a time a very good] example
of the trees.

00:33:11.527 --> 00:33:19.387
See in the tree the sap rises, goes to various
parts of the tree, either it is evaporated

00:33:19.387 --> 00:33:21.487
or it goes back to Mother Earth.

00:33:21.487 --> 00:33:23.377
It never gets attached to anything.

00:33:23.377 --> 00:33:30.588
As long you are attached to your children,
attached to this, attached to that, then try

00:33:30.588 --> 00:33:34.607
to understand that divinity has not fully
manifested.

00:33:34.607 --> 00:33:40.477
That detachment is not neglect, never.

00:33:40.477 --> 00:33:54.987
On the contrary, it is the most pure detachment,
which really nourishes every area of your

00:33:54.987 --> 00:33:55.987
life.

00:33:55.987 --> 00:33:58.668
Wherever you go, it nourishes.

00:33:58.668 --> 00:34:02.017
So you have to test yourself.

00:34:02.017 --> 00:34:03.857
Nobody else has to do it.

00:34:03.857 --> 00:34:07.147
"How far I have been kind to others?

00:34:07.147 --> 00:34:09.767
How far I have been helpful to others?

00:34:09.767 --> 00:34:15.068
How far I have been collective?"

00:34:15.068 --> 00:34:20.157
I have seen glimpses of this many a times
and it has given Me great joy.

00:34:20.157 --> 00:34:29.098
Like, once we had a program of Sahaja yogis
and the gentleman had invited Me alone for

00:34:29.098 --> 00:34:30.098
dinner.

00:34:30.098 --> 00:34:37.538
So the program was there and I just thought
that how can all these people eat in his house,

00:34:37.538 --> 00:34:38.828
you see?

00:34:38.828 --> 00:34:45.017
So I waited till they disappeared, all the
Sahaja Yogis disappeared.

00:34:45.017 --> 00:34:46.058
This gentleman came to say, "Mother why did
you ask them to go?

00:34:46.058 --> 00:34:48.897
I had cooked for all of them."

00:34:48.897 --> 00:34:50.638
See this made Me so happy.

00:34:50.638 --> 00:34:52.138
He had a small house.

00:34:52.138 --> 00:34:56.198
I don't know how he cooked for all of them.

00:34:56.198 --> 00:35:00.818
And so much food he had cooked already and
he was waiting - all of them to have some

00:35:00.818 --> 00:35:07.018
food, and I just thought that it is too much
for him to feed so many people.

00:35:07.018 --> 00:35:16.018
In the same way, we have to have this feeling
that we are all collective and we have to

00:35:16.018 --> 00:35:17.018
help each other.

00:35:17.018 --> 00:35:21.897
It is, say in the body, if I have any problem
in any finger, any hand, anywhere, the whole

00:35:21.897 --> 00:35:31.298
body runs for it, the whole body suffers for
it, whole body knows about it.

00:35:31.298 --> 00:35:38.478
In the same way, in Sahaja Yoga there should
be a common feeling all over the world.

00:35:38.478 --> 00:35:47.107
If something happens here, one person is affected,
the whole world should know.

00:35:47.107 --> 00:35:50.747
Not only that know, but they should make efforts.

00:35:50.747 --> 00:35:56.878
If one person is suffering, the whole world
will suffer for that and this is what is the

00:35:56.878 --> 00:35:58.368
culmination of our collectivity.

00:35:58.368 --> 00:36:06.388
Those who try to keep out of it, you see,
in the collectivity, cannot grow also.

00:36:06.388 --> 00:36:14.548
About many things I have to say, but specially
I would say that when we see somebody in difficulties,

00:36:14.548 --> 00:36:20.668
say financial difficulty, at that time we
should try to suggest or try to help that

00:36:20.668 --> 00:36:25.068
person as just a part and parcel of the whole.

00:36:25.068 --> 00:36:29.858
Then that person will realize that I have
so many people here.

00:36:29.858 --> 00:36:31.398
I am not alone.

00:36:31.398 --> 00:36:37.218
Somebody might get more, somebody might get
less, makes no difference.

00:36:37.218 --> 00:36:44.628
But the activity of the collective should
be such that you should feel that oneness,

00:36:44.628 --> 00:36:51.308
that innate feeling for another person, innate.

00:36:51.308 --> 00:36:59.608
You not have to think about it, but is innately
you should feel attached to that person and

00:36:59.608 --> 00:37:03.068
you should feel that you have to do something
about it.

00:37:03.068 --> 00:37:09.488
"After all, why should he not have the same
joy as I have?"

00:37:09.488 --> 00:37:15.668
So the first thing that you will do, of such
people, is normally... is to help him in his

00:37:15.668 --> 00:37:17.818
chakras, help him in his endeavors.

00:37:17.818 --> 00:37:24.108
It is very easy now to do Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:24.108 --> 00:37:29.098
In the olden times, it was very difficult.

00:37:29.098 --> 00:37:32.798
If you had tried Sahaja Yoga say, in the early
time of Christ, you all might have been crucified.

00:37:32.798 --> 00:37:34.008
Could be.

00:37:34.008 --> 00:37:35.808
What did Christ do after all?

00:37:35.808 --> 00:37:36.808
Why was He crucified?

00:37:36.808 --> 00:37:38.768
But nowadays that's not so.

00:37:38.768 --> 00:37:41.308
Then you...

00:37:41.308 --> 00:37:49.438
like other saints, any people in India, "Thousands
of years," they said, "we have been meditating.

00:37:49.438 --> 00:38:00.008
We started our meditation when we were nothing
and now years after years, our different births

00:38:00.008 --> 00:38:07.028
after births, we have worked hard to get to
this situation, that now we have got realization."

00:38:07.028 --> 00:38:08.908
You don't have that problem.

00:38:08.908 --> 00:38:12.458
There's no problem at all.

00:38:12.458 --> 00:38:21.488
Except for one, that you have to have full
assessment of yourself, that you are the pure

00:38:21.488 --> 00:38:25.668
Spirit and that you are in the kingdom of
God.

00:38:25.668 --> 00:38:29.378
Just like Christ - it did not matter to Him.

00:38:29.378 --> 00:38:32.998
He had to oppose something that was wrong,
He did it.

00:38:32.998 --> 00:38:37.548
When He had to support something was destroyed
and saved, He did it.

00:38:37.548 --> 00:38:44.098
He had nothing to do with Mary Magdalene,
but when people started stoning her, He went

00:38:44.098 --> 00:38:50.958
and stood before her and He said, "Those who
have not committed any sin, can throw stone

00:38:50.958 --> 00:38:51.958
at her."

00:38:51.958 --> 00:38:58.329
See this courage, this confidence was in Him
because He was a divine personality, because

00:38:58.329 --> 00:38:59.358
of divinity.

00:38:59.358 --> 00:39:01.268
But you have become divine.

00:39:01.268 --> 00:39:08.608
In a way, you know better about life than
He knew because He never touched all these

00:39:08.608 --> 00:39:12.668
points that you have touched from what problems
you have come out.

00:39:12.668 --> 00:39:18.058
So, you should have much more understanding
for people who are not in Sahaja Yoga or who

00:39:18.058 --> 00:39:19.058
want to come to Sahaj Yoga.

00:39:19.058 --> 00:39:24.008
Like, as soon as they come to any program,
you should not start saying, "You are a bhoot,

00:39:24.008 --> 00:39:25.568
you are that."

00:39:25.568 --> 00:39:29.218
You were a bhoot before you came here.

00:39:29.218 --> 00:39:35.728
Quite a big bhoot, if you ask Me, I can tell
you.

00:39:35.728 --> 00:39:46.968
But when you realize what is your importance
- now you have become qualified.

00:39:46.968 --> 00:39:50.038
You know everything about it.

00:39:50.038 --> 00:39:57.718
When you know that this has happened, then
try just to follow few rules about Sahaja

00:39:57.718 --> 00:39:58.718
Yoga.

00:39:58.718 --> 00:40:02.968
It's very easy for you to follow because you
are divine.

00:40:02.968 --> 00:40:03.968
No problem.

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:04.968
No problem.

00:40:04.968 --> 00:40:11.518
You can follow it very well, but don't yield
to human pressures that still linger in you

00:40:11.518 --> 00:40:13.788
or may be in the society.

00:40:13.788 --> 00:40:20.878
You keep to your own style, to your own behavior
and you'll be amazed that the rest of the

00:40:20.878 --> 00:40:24.878
world will worship you - not hang you, but
worship you.

00:40:24.878 --> 00:40:27.238
In your lifetime, it's going to happen.

00:40:27.238 --> 00:40:36.058
But try to understand that you are being resurrected
for a purpose, and that purpose is to transform

00:40:36.058 --> 00:40:41.218
this world into a beautiful place for which
all of you should, with full attention, with

00:40:41.218 --> 00:40:45.938
full understanding about yourself, about your
responsibilities, should jump into it.

00:40:45.938 --> 00:40:49.738
Australia has a special responsibility.

00:40:49.738 --> 00:40:59.278
As I told you, some are so over-responsible
and some are not at all.

00:40:59.278 --> 00:41:07.558
I can't understand why it is so, why it (is)
happening like that.

00:41:07.558 --> 00:41:14.808
I see people who are so attentive and some
whose attention is still not all right - moving

00:41:14.808 --> 00:41:17.668
like this, moving like that.

00:41:17.668 --> 00:41:22.678
So, you should try to follow people who have
reached a certain height.

00:41:22.678 --> 00:41:28.678
Try to follow their life, their lifestyle
and then you will be amazed that you can do

00:41:28.678 --> 00:41:30.348
it very easily because you are mature.

00:41:30.348 --> 00:41:36.698
It's like, I have said that we are like an
egg and it has to be hatched once you are

00:41:36.698 --> 00:41:38.368
mature, but some chicks come out and just
start walking nicely, with little, little

00:41:38.368 --> 00:41:43.928
legs you see them very nicely walking towards
the mother.

00:41:43.928 --> 00:41:54.478
And the others are still there covered with
all kinds of filth on them and not able to

00:41:54.478 --> 00:42:01.258
walk and then these ones who can walk just
bring them, you see, they poke them with their

00:42:01.258 --> 00:42:06.218
beaks and say, "Come along, come along, come
along" and they bring it to the mother.

00:42:06.218 --> 00:42:07.218
It's very interesting.

00:42:07.218 --> 00:42:08.218
You must watch them.

00:42:08.218 --> 00:42:16.698
This Easter has a great meaning that we are
now newly born chicks and we have to now follow

00:42:16.698 --> 00:42:18.628
a new path.

00:42:18.628 --> 00:42:23.318
It's a very simple path, but still we are
conditioned so we are afraid, maybe, or we

00:42:23.318 --> 00:42:25.168
have an ego, whatever it is.

00:42:25.168 --> 00:42:27.008
So drop out all these things.

00:42:27.008 --> 00:42:33.878
Just humble down and just start walking on
this path of Sahaj and one day Australia should

00:42:33.878 --> 00:42:36.298
be able to cover the whole world.

00:42:36.298 --> 00:42:38.448
I can't see why not?

00:42:38.448 --> 00:42:49.498
After all you are the mooladhara and the mooladhara
must play its own role as the wisest people.

00:42:49.498 --> 00:42:55.868
Wisdom is the power that you get from Shri
Ganesh.

00:42:55.868 --> 00:43:04.448
So you have to be wise, absolutely wise and
know that you have been seekers.

00:43:04.448 --> 00:43:07.328
You didn't get it because I asked you or we
paid you or anything, but you were seekers

00:43:07.328 --> 00:43:15.308
struggling to know the truth and that's how
you got it and once you have got it, you should

00:43:15.308 --> 00:43:20.069
establish it fully in your life and also in
the lives of others.

00:43:20.094 --> 00:43:24.687
Let others also feel this gentleman is very
unique or this lady is very unique.

00:43:25.012 --> 00:43:31.424
She's very different, she's not selfish, she's
not cunning, she doesn't manipulate, but somehow

00:43:31.453 --> 00:43:40.565
by her character, by her nature she is trying
to create light for us and enlighten our path,

00:43:40.594 --> 00:43:43.026
enlighten the path of others.

00:43:43.051 --> 00:43:44.708
May God bless you all.

00:43:57.317 --> 00:44:05.651
Of course, today we must have Shri Ganesha's
puja for doubly reasons because of Australia

00:44:08.079 --> 00:44:10.920
and because of Christ.

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:17.149
It's very important that our Ganesha must
be beautifully fixed.

00:44:17.925 --> 00:44:29.747
And that His light should really emit in our
day to day lifestyle and also it shows on

00:44:29.772 --> 00:44:35.714
our face, in our eyes because you know the
eyes are governed by Christ himself.

00:44:36.476 --> 00:44:41.967
And where the light comes in, you see, when
you get your realization, the tingling in

00:44:41.992 --> 00:44:46.506
the eye comes because of His awakening within
us.

00:44:46.531 --> 00:44:54.173
So, we have to today really pray that we should
have that magnificent character of Christ

00:44:54.209 --> 00:45:00.768
which was expressing Ganesha's or manifesting
Ganesha's qualities.

00:45:05.688 --> 00:45:08.107
[ASIDE: Attharvasheesh karna chahiye.

00:45:08.132 --> 00:45:09.775
To per dhulva do (MEANS Let's do Ganesha Attharvasheesha.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.138
So get the feet washed)]

00:45:11.163 --> 00:45:17.799
Now children have to come up here: I think,
say 5 to 10, the children can come up.
