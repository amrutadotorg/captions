00:13.754 --> 00:19.812
But the principle of Ganesha is extremely
subtle,

00:20.013 --> 00:25.338
is the subtlest of subtle. And it exists
in everything,

00:25.539 --> 00:30.788
that it exists in the matter in the form
of vibrations.

00:30.989 --> 00:35.692
There is no matter which is without
vibrations.

00:35.893 --> 00:44.782
It has vibrations which are seen even
in the atoms

00:44.983 --> 00:51.560
and also in the molecules of all matter
that is existing.

00:51.761 --> 00:58.154
So Shri Ganesha is the first one who was
established in the matter, as well.

00:58.355 --> 01:01.864
As a result we can see, He exists
in the sun,

01:02.065 --> 01:06.503
He exists in the moon, He exists in
the whole universe, in the whole creation,

01:06.704 --> 01:10.763
and He continues to exist in human beings
also.

01:10.964 --> 01:19.476
And what makes you - the feeling that we
are now a means, a means, we can say,

01:19.677 --> 01:25.509
an instrument, a media, by which we express
the Ganesha Tattwa all over,

01:25.710 --> 01:30.881
that is vibrations. So the vibrations
itself about which you are asking,

01:31.082 --> 01:35.113
these vibrations themselves are nothing
but the Principle of Shri Ganesha.

01:35.314 --> 01:37.166
He’s Omkara.

01:37.367 --> 01:42.484
And when it is, then what is it, that
feeling as I told you, the vatsalya,

01:42.685 --> 01:47.345
the feeling of love between a child and
a mother?

01:47.546 --> 01:52.880
That feeling, it is the one that is
vibrations

01:53.081 --> 01:55.266
between the child and the mother.

01:55.467 --> 02:02.725
The distance between the two is vibrations
and that’s what one has to feel –

02:02.926 --> 02:11.414
that he’s a child still and there is the
mother and mother is bringing the child,

02:11.615 --> 02:16.175
giving all the powers to the child,
bringing up, loving the child,

02:16.376 --> 02:21.268
understanding the limitations of the child,
looking after, all that.

02:21.469 --> 02:28.199
All the sweetness, all the wisdom
of the child to be appreciated.

02:28.400 --> 02:32.351
That is vibrations. And if you see
the subtle side of this,

02:32.552 --> 02:38.272
it’s not my child. Should not – this is
not only a limited thing

02:38.473 --> 02:43.999
because it is eternal, it’s everywhere,
so you cannot have it limited.

02:44.200 --> 02:51.556
In everything you do I have seen people,
the way they handle things in the West –

02:51.757 --> 02:56.426
we Indians have to learn also from them.

02:58.552 --> 03:01.239
(Aside: What’s happening?)

03:02.567 --> 03:11.640
So we have to accept for them what is
the way to handle also beautiful things,

03:11.841 --> 03:18.035
how to look after beautiful things, how
to manage beautiful relationships.

03:18.236 --> 03:21.387
See, you shouldn’t be harsh, you shouldn’t
be unkind,

03:21.588 --> 03:25.963
you shouldn’t say things which are
insulting to others

03:26.164 --> 03:28.525
so that the relationships are broken.

03:28.726 --> 03:32.731
So all the relationships that are between
human beings and God

03:32.932 --> 03:38.326
are through the Ganesha Principle. So
when it becomes the relationship

03:38.527 --> 03:42.977
between you and God, then there are
vibrations

03:43.178 --> 03:48.603
and then that same relationship should
extend to everything that you do.

03:48.804 --> 03:54.337
You should see what things are good,
whatever has got vibrations.

03:54.538 --> 03:57.937
Now today I want to tell you something
very important

03:58.138 --> 04:01.436
about this all-pervading power we heard
about.

04:01.637 --> 04:06.995
These are nothing but vibrations.
Paramchaitanya is nothing but vibrations,

04:07.196 --> 04:09.768
where all identities are lost –

04:09.969 --> 04:12.863
where the mother is lost, father is lost,
we can say –

04:13.064 --> 04:17.066
nothing remains when it is just this
vibrations,

04:17.267 --> 04:24.348
this subtle vatsalya exists. That’s all.

04:24.549 --> 04:32.510
And this is the only thing out of which
everything comes and remains in itself.

04:32.711 --> 04:35.636
Like we can say that the suns rays come out

04:35.837 --> 04:40.953
and then they try to create chlorophyll.

04:41.154 --> 04:44.906
So it’s not that we cannot compare sun
with that.

04:45.107 --> 04:50.694
Or we can say, from the ocean the clouds
come out

04:50.895 --> 04:55.729
and they try to nourish the Mother Earth.

04:55.930 --> 05:00.278
That’s also – cannot be compared.
Everything is inside.

05:00.479 --> 05:04.189
This Paramachaitanya has got everything
inside this.

05:04.390 --> 05:09.246
So we can say that everything is nothing
but knowledge,

05:09.447 --> 05:12.767
is nothing but truth, is nothing but light.

05:12.968 --> 05:22.854
But when the folds of these come out, then
we get into the folds of that Chaitanya

05:23.055 --> 05:26.791
and then we become ignorant, but there
is nothing like ignorance.

05:26.992 --> 05:30.066
It doesn’t exist, it doesn’t exist.

05:30.267 --> 05:33.661
Like there is darkness because there is
no light.

05:33.862 --> 05:37.702
Once light comes, it doesn’t exist,
doesn’t exist.

05:37.903 --> 05:40.101
So ignorance doesn’t exist.

05:40.302 --> 05:49.633
But what happens that the folds of this
ocean, into that people go and it is lost.

05:49.834 --> 05:52.501
Thus we understand one thing very clearly:

05:52.702 --> 05:57.290
that we are in Paramachaitanya. We are
made by Paramachaitanya,

05:57.491 --> 05:59.616
all the time we are surrounded by it.

05:59.817 --> 06:04.304
Only thing is, we are sometimes lost
in the folds.

06:04.505 --> 06:19.298
And why? Why we are lost in the folds is
because of our own – our own unawareness.

06:19.499 --> 06:26.097
This awareness has to come: that we are
part and parcel of that Paramachaitanya.

06:26.298 --> 06:35.055
The whole thing is called as chitvilasa,
is the vilas,

06:35.256 --> 06:42.344
is the playful enjoyment of God’s
Attention.

06:42.545 --> 06:45.654
Now you will say, “How can that be?”
For example,

06:45.858 --> 06:50.774
we see the sun – and just to give a simile
closer to it, we see the sun

06:50.975 --> 06:55.248
and then we see the water. We see
the water in the lake, right?

06:55.449 --> 06:59.378
There is water – because of the sun,
we can see the water there.

06:59.579 --> 07:02.993
Then supposing we see the mirage.

07:03.194 --> 07:07.587
We see the mirage and then we think
this is water,

07:07.788 --> 07:13.516
we run after the water. But the whole
thing is a play of the sun,

07:13.717 --> 07:19.787
whether it’s a mirage, whether it’s
a water, whether it’s the sun.

07:20.327 --> 07:26.418
In the same way, this Paramachaitanya
acts and what we get lost

07:26.619 --> 07:29.803
is in our awareness that we are
Paramachaitanya.

07:30.004 --> 07:33.036
That’s why the play starts, the play starts

07:33.237 --> 07:39.091
like yesterday’s – day before yesterday’s
Puja, what did we do?

07:39.292 --> 07:42.866
We were sitting there and it started
raining.

07:43.067 --> 07:50.070
So to prove, to prove that I can control
rain.

07:50.271 --> 07:53.629
So it rained. Some people were covering up
something, this thing.

07:53.830 --> 07:57.915
I gave a bandhan. After some time, the rain
moved out

07:58.116 --> 08:03.417
from the Puja to the back side. It was not
raining where you were sitting.

08:03.639 --> 08:08.040
And after that, it became the sun and it
was so clouded.

08:08.241 --> 08:10.482
Sun came, it became sunny,

08:10.683 --> 08:16.571
so that’s how you have to become aware
of the powers of Chaitanya.

08:16.772 --> 08:21.666
Now when you give bandhan, what you do
is to put the Chaitanya into action,

08:21.867 --> 08:25.152
“Now act here, now act there, act here.”

08:25.353 --> 08:31.754
Though you are, supposing, in the ocean,
but the ocean acts on you all the time.

08:31.955 --> 08:34.934
You cannot act on the ocean, you cannot
ask water

08:35.135 --> 08:38.619
to do this and do that. But as realised
souls, you are empowered,

08:38.820 --> 08:44.665
now you can ask water, “Alright, you
dissolve this, you do this, you do that.”

08:44.866 --> 08:47.404
But for that, it is important to be
the masters.

08:47.605 --> 08:51.991
And to become the masters, you see, like
a matter becomes a human being,

08:52.192 --> 08:55.590
and from human being you have to become
the masters of the matter

08:55.752 --> 08:57.374
and you handle the matter.

08:57.575 --> 09:00.909
So we come back to the same. Like
agriculture, we can handle,

09:01.110 --> 09:03.688
just vibrate it. We can handle water,

09:03.889 --> 09:07.496
we can handle the sun, we can handle moon -
because there’s a rapport.

09:07.697 --> 09:11.314
Now we are aware a rapport has been
established,

09:11.515 --> 09:15.680
so all this play is extremely beautiful
to Me. I see it.

09:15.881 --> 09:19.029
But now you all have to know

09:19.230 --> 09:25.242
that you all have become realised souls
and you have those powers.

09:25.443 --> 09:29.196
So all other nonsensical things that you
learn,

09:29.397 --> 09:35.008
all nonsensical things you indulge into you
better give up. There’s no sense in it.

09:35.209 --> 09:37.569
Whatever is sensible you should do

09:37.770 --> 09:41.246
because there’s Shri Ganesha within you
who is absolutely sensible.

09:41.447 --> 09:44.479
He is nothing but sense. He is the giver
of sense,

09:44.680 --> 09:48.040
so He is the killer of the demons, as they
say.

09:48.241 --> 09:53.815
He is the one who removes all the ordeals.
By how? By improving our awareness.

09:54.016 --> 09:58.995
Though ordeals do not remain, because
you give a bandhan, it works out.

09:59.196 --> 10:03.730
Now I asked somebody – Phil – I asked him
to write down about the miracles,

10:03.931 --> 10:08.000
and he says now it has become like
a voluminous book.

10:08.201 --> 10:11.975
It will be, because before Realisation

10:12.176 --> 10:16.485
whatever looked like miracle is no more
a miracle. Miracle has lost its meaning,

10:16.686 --> 10:19.048
because now you are empowered, and you
can do it.

10:19.249 --> 10:23.655
It works in everything: in your talent,
in your understanding,

10:23.856 --> 10:27.178
in your education, in everywhere.
Like there are some boys who said,

10:27.379 --> 10:30.813
“Mother, You see, we couldn’t solve
one problem so we gave a bandhan.

10:31.014 --> 10:35.212
Immediately the whole thing came onto us
and we wrote it down”, and they stood first.

10:35.413 --> 10:40.409
It has happened with many. So in every
action, in every thing,

10:40.610 --> 10:45.486
whatever you do, you should know it is
the Paramachaitanya that acts.

10:45.687 --> 10:49.618
Only thing you have to be aware
of yourself, and aware of it, it acts

10:49.819 --> 10:56.758
and you just jump into that awareness
and it works, and that you have seen.

10:56.959 --> 11:01.094
But still so many people do not know.

11:01.295 --> 11:04.985
So many people still, though they know
through their brains,

11:05.186 --> 11:07.535
do not know in their hearts. And so many
people,

11:07.736 --> 11:11.314
even if they know in their hearts, they do
not act in their attention.

11:11.515 --> 11:15.373
So only these three things you have
to improve: is one is your head,

11:15.574 --> 11:18.417
another is your heart and third is your
liver.

11:18.618 --> 11:22.626
If you can improve these three organs,
this Paramachaitanya will act.

11:22.827 --> 11:26.547
But then, all this attention about money.
So many people,

11:26.748 --> 11:30.487
money this, that. There’s nothing to worry.

11:30.688 --> 11:33.579
Paramachaitanya will create everything
for you, whatever you want.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.045
It may not create money because it
doesn’t have a mint,

11:36.246 --> 11:44.399
but it will create possibilities –
possibilities

11:44.600 --> 11:48.853
and this is something to be understood
very well, and it’s so blissful

11:49.054 --> 11:51.968
to know that now you are aware
of the Paramachaitanya

11:52.169 --> 11:56.429
and you can master It. Master It
in the sense not that you dominate It,

11:56.631 --> 11:58.709
but you ask Him like a djinn. You know,
you can say,

11:58.910 --> 12:03.655
“All right, do this, do that”, with
respect. With respect it works.

12:03.876 --> 12:07.224
All these things are to be understood,
now that we have entered

12:07.425 --> 12:11.633
into the Kingdom of God, means
Paramachaitanya,

12:11.834 --> 12:16.274
and that we are very important citizens
of that.

12:16.475 --> 12:22.445
If one can understand this, then I think
Sahaja Yoga can be very successful.

12:22.646 --> 12:26.453
Everything will work out. Miraculously,
everything will work out.

12:26.654 --> 12:33.070
And all those who are not aware about the
possibilities as to what they can reach,

12:33.271 --> 12:35.865
they are thrown out, in the sense,
in the fold,

12:36.066 --> 12:39.726
in the ignorance, so called into
the darkness.

12:39.927 --> 12:43.594
Again they can come back to light
when they have sense.

12:43.795 --> 12:45.451
So be forgiving about them.

12:45.652 --> 12:49.305
It can happen to you also if you
understand that way.

12:49.506 --> 12:54.146
I hope today’s lecture you have been able
to assimilate within yourself.

12:54.347 --> 12:59.156
That’s very important to assimilate, to
know that you are in the Paramachaitanya

12:59.357 --> 13:05.208
and that’s how you will become very sweet,
you will become very considerate,

13:05.409 --> 13:10.779
and very loving, affectionate and wise.

13:10.980 --> 13:14.386
That’s very important.

13:14.587 --> 13:18.304
May God bless you.
