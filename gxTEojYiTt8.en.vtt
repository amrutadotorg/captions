Public Program The Nabhi Chakra

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.360
New Delhi – India January 31, 1983

00:15:50.868 --> 00:15:56.999
The music was very fine and elevating to all of you.

00:16:00.514 --> 00:16:03.837
The effect of music in Sahaja Yoga is tremendous,

00:16:04.803 --> 00:16:07.225
and if a Sahaja Yogi sings the song

00:16:09.029 --> 00:16:15.327
it's so great that it acts like a mantra upon My being.

00:16:16.216 --> 00:16:20.705
So I'm very thankful to Mrs. Venogopalan

00:16:21.926 --> 00:16:25.860
for singing such a beautiful song today. It stirred Me completely.

00:16:27.316 --> 00:16:33.594
Then Gavin Brown was very sweet. He's an Englishman, very gentle

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.928
and a very steady Sahaja Yogi.

00:16:37.282 --> 00:16:40.938
He's one of the first Western Sahaja Yogis

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:42.938
I met.

00:16:46.556 --> 00:16:52.116
Today I will tell you about the Nabhi Chakra which deals

00:16:52.365 --> 00:16:55.046
with this honesty of seeking.

00:16:58.156 --> 00:17:03.006
Nabhi Chakra is the center which controls

00:17:03.961 --> 00:17:07.747
or manifests outside in the gross as

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:17.695
Solar Plexus. Nabhi Chakra has two sides: one is the left,

00:17:17.955 --> 00:17:21.750
another the right, and one in the center.

00:17:24.437 --> 00:17:27.521
So on the left hand side is the Gruha Lakshmi,

00:17:28.447 --> 00:17:30.557
on the right hand side is the Raja Lakshmi

00:17:30.602 --> 00:17:35.294
or Gaja Lakshmi and in the center is the Lakshmi

00:17:35.473 --> 00:17:37.709
which ascends into Mahalakshmi.

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:55.923
When the seeking starts, a human being

00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:00.247
first starts seeking food.

00:18:02.605 --> 00:18:08.352
Food is very important for all the animals. If they have no food

00:18:12.959 --> 00:18:19.771
then they cannot exist. So the seeking starts

00:18:20.602 --> 00:18:27.972
with food, and when the shelter is sought, they try to find the water.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.114
So this center is made of water

00:18:43.439 --> 00:18:52.677
and in this center resides the Deity of Shri Vishnu or Narayana;

00:18:58.023 --> 00:19:05.428
and His power, as I told you, is Lakshmi and then Mahalakshmi.

00:19:07.705 --> 00:19:09.705
You will find out in Sahaja Yoga

00:19:10.944 --> 00:19:17.944
that gradually you start developing one power and then the other.

00:19:19.765 --> 00:19:23.817
Everyone who comes to Sahaja Yoga, if they are truthful

00:19:24.891 --> 00:19:29.007
and not involved with any wrong things,

00:19:30.847 --> 00:19:34.657
then definitely they are helped in Lakshmi Tattwa,

00:19:34.997 --> 00:19:37.958
means their well-being is looked after.

00:19:38.177 --> 00:19:41.465
As Krishna has said, "yogakshema vahaamya."

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.670
So He looks after the kshema part of it.

00:19:46.268 --> 00:19:49.162
Everyone who has been to Sahaja Yoga

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.380
has been helped miraculously

00:19:51.631 --> 00:19:54.937
also in the Lakshmi Tattwa, that means materially.

00:19:56.348 --> 00:19:58.308
In so many ways they are helped,

00:19:58.489 --> 00:20:00.489
that one has to just see for themselves

00:20:00.953 --> 00:20:03.573
how these miracles take place.

00:20:04.485 --> 00:20:13.433
An example is of a villager who had a small little holding of land

00:20:14.655 --> 00:20:20.486
and he was living hand to mouth every day.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.645
When he came to Me, after some time I found

00:20:25.768 --> 00:20:27.711
he would bring one garland,

00:20:27.763 --> 00:20:30.155
big garland, for Me every evening.

00:20:30.599 --> 00:20:33.812
And he was away in the village every day he would attend My program.

00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:40.227
I was quite surprised that how could he afford it, and I asked him,

00:20:40.673 --> 00:20:44.431
"How can you afford a garland for Me every day?

00:20:44.512 --> 00:20:46.186
You shouldn't bring it, it's not proper."

00:20:48.269 --> 00:20:49.975
So he said, "Mother, You know everything."

00:20:50.332 --> 00:20:51.819
I said, "Why, what happened?"

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:57.893
He said, "I have a plot of land next to mine

00:20:57.952 --> 00:21:01.448
which we never used because it was absolutely a barren land -

00:21:01.576 --> 00:21:06.483
little bit, not much big land, but a small land, piece of land.

00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:11.194
And after Realization I used to always go

00:21:11.618 --> 00:21:14.909
walk over it bare feet to plough this little

00:21:15.203 --> 00:21:16.945
piece of land that I had.

00:21:18.542 --> 00:21:22.387
After some time when I was coming here after that,

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:25.957
one gentleman came to see me and he said that

00:21:26.551 --> 00:21:28.936
“This piece of land that you have is very precious.“

00:21:29.915 --> 00:21:32.996
He said, “What's the problem?” He said that

00:21:33.134 --> 00:21:41.240
“I have a kiln of bricks, and I have seen that even

00:21:41.771 --> 00:21:49.920
by chance – Sahaja - we mixed a little clay from this soil,

00:21:50.003 --> 00:21:54.793
from this part of the land that you have,

00:21:55.146 --> 00:21:59.808
and we found that our bricks have become so good and so strong

00:22:00.408 --> 00:22:01.999
that we would like to purchase

00:22:02.195 --> 00:22:06.664
this clay from you at the price of seers."

00:22:08.314 --> 00:22:10.929
And that's how he started getting money sufficient

00:22:10.986 --> 00:22:17.061
for him and he became much better off.

00:22:17.848 --> 00:22:21.736
But in Sahaja Yoga one has to remember you don't go to extremes,

00:22:22.126 --> 00:22:23.685
in any principle.

00:22:23.831 --> 00:22:27.297
That is one thing people should know, that you don't go to extremes.

00:22:28.873 --> 00:22:31.188
You don't become extremely rich.

00:22:32.617 --> 00:22:35.645
I've seen those people who are extremely rich,

00:22:35.675 --> 00:22:37.789
when they come to Sahaja Yoga, they are a big headache,

00:22:38.324 --> 00:22:41.465
very big headache. If they are sick,

00:22:41.667 --> 00:22:44.235
if you cure them of their heart trouble,

00:22:45.773 --> 00:22:47.601
then they try to possess you.

00:22:48.355 --> 00:22:50.722
They will get all the heart patients, they will get

00:22:50.764 --> 00:22:52.375
all kinds of patients to you,

00:22:52.632 --> 00:22:55.373
you go on tolerating it, they try to possess you.

00:22:55.651 --> 00:22:57.899
They immediately start talking about their cures

00:22:57.932 --> 00:23:00.448
to everyone, they publish in papers, this thing, that thing,

00:23:00.844 --> 00:23:04.593
it's impossible. And they just try to overpower you.

00:23:04.698 --> 00:23:05.788
Without any appointment

00:23:05.806 --> 00:23:08.766
they'll arrive and they would expect you to attend to them immediately,

00:23:08.786 --> 00:23:09.793
it's terrible.

00:23:13.606 --> 00:23:16.433
And then they’ll send all their relations for cure

00:23:17.891 --> 00:23:19.635
and you have to show all patience,

00:23:19.773 --> 00:23:21.896
all their friends, they become like agents.

00:23:23.401 --> 00:23:28.723
All their patients, all their relations, all their friends,

00:23:29.527 --> 00:23:32.981
they want to oblige them and spare

00:23:33.272 --> 00:23:36.210
no love, no affection, nothing further.

00:23:38.797 --> 00:23:41.974
The Sahaja Yogis, if they try

00:23:42.224 --> 00:23:44.665
to say that “No, you shouldn't do like that and all that,"

00:23:45.104 --> 00:23:46.182
they feel insulted.

00:23:48.322 --> 00:23:50.859
And they all try curing much faster

00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:54.252
than anybody else does.

00:23:54.456 --> 00:23:55.517
They themselves are weak,

00:23:55.596 --> 00:23:57.031
they are sick people themselves,

00:23:57.518 --> 00:23:59.228
heart patient, this patient, that,

00:23:59.372 --> 00:24:01.436
but if you tell them, “Don't cure,” they'll feel bad.

00:24:02.281 --> 00:24:03.194
If you don't tell them,

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:04.973
they'll get sick and you'll have another problem.

00:24:05.977 --> 00:24:08.772
They never try to understand Sahaja Yoga in it's big way.

00:24:09.329 --> 00:24:16.602
They just want to see it according to their own way of ego

00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:20.078
that they have accumulated with their money,

00:24:21.222 --> 00:24:24.310
and they never know how they go on hurting

00:24:24.762 --> 00:24:30.713
everyone by overpowering Me all the time.

00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:35.208
It's very amazing, whenever I cure a rich man,

00:24:35.367 --> 00:24:38.403
I've been wanting to run away from that person.

00:24:38.515 --> 00:24:41.812
I would never go to their house, I would not like to eat in their house.

00:24:41.975 --> 00:24:43.703
It's a very bad thing.

00:24:46.343 --> 00:24:50.978
So too much of riches is also not okay

00:24:51.386 --> 00:24:54.402
because it gives you a tremendous

00:24:54.774 --> 00:24:56.536
ego that you don't see yourself,

00:24:56.539 --> 00:24:59.212
and anybody tries to say anything protect oneself,

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:02.993
then such a person feels insulted or humiliated.

00:25:03.742 --> 00:25:08.463
Not only that, but they try to hold Me and hold the whole thing

00:25:08.544 --> 00:25:13.082
according to their business ways which is impossible.

00:25:13.451 --> 00:25:14.927
See, they have to gain money,

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.441
they have another attitude because they are miserly.

00:25:18.556 --> 00:25:20.534
I don't have to earn money or anything.

00:25:20.856 --> 00:25:22.924
If I am doing anything, I’m, really,

00:25:23.043 --> 00:25:25.043
in a way, I'm obliging. Isn't it?

00:25:26.184 --> 00:25:29.603
But they will force on Me all their rules and regulations, everything,

00:25:29.633 --> 00:25:31.353
without having their own discipline.

00:25:32.104 --> 00:25:34.907
So very rich people in Sahaja Yoga

00:25:35.178 --> 00:25:39.469
so far have been extremely troublesome,

00:25:39.525 --> 00:25:42.892
I should say, to Me and to the whole organization.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:44.990
They are very narrow-minded.

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:50.149
They cannot see the big vision that I have before Me.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.280
Whatever little ideas they have about themselves and about their

00:25:55.446 --> 00:25:59.184
own thinking, reading, they will try to push onto Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:02.730
It's not My experience once, but many a times.

00:26:02.917 --> 00:26:06.842
Then somehow or other it so happens that they drop out.

00:26:08.236 --> 00:26:12.186
So, too much richness gives you a tremendous ego, worse than

00:26:12.585 --> 00:26:15.198
even, I would say, a bulldog.

00:26:16.416 --> 00:26:19.676
It’s impossible for a rich man to see

00:26:19.897 --> 00:26:24.377
that all these riches are outside him. They are not inside him.

00:26:25.306 --> 00:26:30.052
He has to be rich in heart to understand compassion.

00:26:30.161 --> 00:26:33.513
Compassion doesn't mean that you give alms to others,

00:26:33.698 --> 00:26:36.454
or if you give money to others, it's not that.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.299
On the contrary, you just have beggars by doing that.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.230
Compassion is that works,

00:26:46.435 --> 00:26:48.687
compassion is that flows,

00:26:50.112 --> 00:26:52.535
compassion is that manifests.

00:26:53.085 --> 00:26:56.817
It is not in compassion where you can make it materialize it,

00:26:56.846 --> 00:26:58.731
“All right, come along I'll give you a hundred rupees.”

00:27:00.357 --> 00:27:03.750
On the contrary, giving somebody a hundred rupees is the worst thing.

00:27:05.212 --> 00:27:08.121
I have tried this with some Sahaja Yogis who were with Me.

00:27:08.813 --> 00:27:12.288
I tried to give them some money some time as they were very poor.

00:27:12.489 --> 00:27:14.365
They became horrid.

00:27:17.024 --> 00:27:20.462
Some of them started drinking,

00:27:20.574 --> 00:27:22.943
some of them took to some other ways and they became

00:27:22.956 --> 00:27:25.542
sort of addicted to money. It was impossible.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:28.592
And they tried to spoil as many Sahaj Yogis as they could.

00:27:31.941 --> 00:27:36.029
So such people if they come, it's impossible to manage them.

00:27:37.703 --> 00:27:40.542
They are not Sahaja Yogis because they are asahaja.

00:27:40.699 --> 00:27:44.249
They are still sticking to the idea that they have so much money,

00:27:44.296 --> 00:27:48.816
that they are so rich and they can overpower everyone with money.

00:27:48.926 --> 00:27:50.926
Not Me, I'm sorry.

00:27:54.594 --> 00:28:01.998
But only thing I feel sorry for them that they cannot get to God.

00:28:02.722 --> 00:28:08.592
There is no honesty of seeking in them, there is no honesty of seeking.

00:28:09.493 --> 00:28:12.621
The elite people whom I have addressed

00:28:12.637 --> 00:28:14.869
so many places like this, because

00:28:15.219 --> 00:28:19.346
some people whom I have cured wanted Me to address the elite,

00:28:19.366 --> 00:28:23.919
so-called. I think they are elated, to Me what they are.

00:28:24.018 --> 00:28:27.061
They don't want to be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:27.194 --> 00:28:29.543
They are already eliminated, I sometimes feel.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:33.569
Thousands of them I've addressed, I've wasted My time with them.

00:28:33.726 --> 00:28:37.618
They are good for nothing, absolutely empty people.

00:28:41.185 --> 00:28:43.603
They are very happy because they have a few cars,

00:28:43.615 --> 00:28:45.615
or some houses or something like that.

00:28:46.526 --> 00:28:51.363
I too have all these things, I would say so-called riches.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.691
I have always seen from My father's side

00:28:54.879 --> 00:28:56.686
and from My husband's side.

00:28:56.996 --> 00:29:00.818
I don't understand what is there to be proud of this emptiness.

00:29:01.046 --> 00:29:06.806
But human beings are such, a empty vessel makes a big sound,

00:29:07.449 --> 00:29:12.026
in the same way, an empty rich man makes a very big sound.

00:29:16.918 --> 00:29:21.126
Not that the very poor are also good,

00:29:21.774 --> 00:29:23.774
because those who are extremely poor

00:29:24.916 --> 00:29:27.316
are busy with their food problems.

00:29:27.546 --> 00:29:30.752
They have little, little problems and their values are still have to

00:29:30.776 --> 00:29:32.097
come up to a point.

00:29:32.472 --> 00:29:35.876
It's only in the middle you can work out Sahaja Yoga better.

00:29:37.108 --> 00:29:39.556
Those who are extremely rich and proud

00:29:39.739 --> 00:29:42.581
cannot come to Sahaja Yoga easily.

00:29:42.758 --> 00:29:45.651
Those who are very poor also cannot come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:46.182 --> 00:29:52.489
But when this middle part of the river is enriched

00:29:52.676 --> 00:29:55.318
and starts flowing well, then it spreads on the sides

00:29:55.367 --> 00:29:56.933
and then it can engulf.

00:29:57.134 --> 00:29:59.877
But you cannot  start it the other way round. I have tried.

00:30:00.187 --> 00:30:01.426
I have tried both ways

00:30:01.736 --> 00:30:03.088
and I have told you what happened.

00:30:03.214 --> 00:30:04.459
Whom I gave money,

00:30:05.065 --> 00:30:07.065
whom I tried to help through giving money

00:30:07.738 --> 00:30:10.993
became wayward, useless, frivolous people,

00:30:11.543 --> 00:30:17.009
got lost to Sahaja Yoga. And those whom I thought

00:30:17.027 --> 00:30:19.081
were moneyed and satisfied people

00:30:19.425 --> 00:30:23.551
had another role to play is to possess Me all the time,

00:30:23.781 --> 00:30:26.184
to use Me all the time whenever they wanted,

00:30:26.602 --> 00:30:30.124
for whatever purpose they wanted to use Me.

00:30:33.156 --> 00:30:37.261
And they must know, you cannot possess Me, you cannot possess Me,

00:30:38.798 --> 00:30:40.510
but this kind of an ignorance

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.847
still in their minds is that they can possess God,

00:30:42.857 --> 00:30:44.017
they can possess everyone.

00:30:46.154 --> 00:30:52.269
For such people there are no reasons

00:30:53.331 --> 00:30:55.331
to come to Sahaja Yoga, to be very frank.

00:30:56.088 --> 00:30:58.112
And even if they come to Sahaja Yog

00:30:59.082 --> 00:31:03.390
they have to know that for Mother richness of heart,

00:31:03.949 --> 00:31:05.949
understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:06.546 --> 00:31:10.702
humility, non-possessiveness are very important.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:24.882
In this ascent of yours, money is not important at all.

00:31:25.994 --> 00:31:28.958
Even if you are poor or rich, you get your Realization.

00:31:29.371 --> 00:31:34.532
For example, I went to Maharashtra, most of them are,

00:31:35.766 --> 00:31:38.663
I would say, very poor people

00:31:38.842 --> 00:31:40.082
in the sense that

00:31:40.336 --> 00:31:43.343
they are not middle class at all. They are not educated,

00:31:44.006 --> 00:31:47.284
they are sometimes factory workers

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:52.606
or they have small holdings. Not very rich.

00:31:53.813 --> 00:31:56.987
But they are very good Sahaja Yogis, excellent Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:57.679 --> 00:32:00.524
They have such beautiful eyes

00:32:00.833 --> 00:32:04.544
and such beautiful feeling and such compassion

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:12.158
that Lakshmi Tattwa is absolutely balanced in them.

00:32:13.598 --> 00:32:17.327
You know that Lakshmi is shown to be a lady,

00:32:18.231 --> 00:32:21.547
and lady who is a mother.

00:32:22.416 --> 00:32:25.500
Mother doesn't care whether you are rich or poor.

00:32:26.286 --> 00:32:29.557
If her one son is rich and another is poor,

00:32:29.831 --> 00:32:33.440
she'll pay more attention to the poor and ask the rich

00:32:33.563 --> 00:32:35.917
to give his money to the poor also.

00:32:36.581 --> 00:32:39.983
She is not bothered. If somebody is in need,

00:32:40.173 --> 00:32:42.638
she will be the first to help the person who needs.

00:32:43.616 --> 00:32:47.302
Now this is a spiritual thing in the spiritual life.

00:32:48.292 --> 00:32:50.292
The person who is a real seeker,

00:32:50.396 --> 00:32:54.354
who is a truthful seeker, the Mother will go out of the way

00:32:56.791 --> 00:33:00.679
to be with that person. And those who are not honest about it,

00:33:01.328 --> 00:33:03.882
Mother will try somehow or other cut them short.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:14.842
The problem that lies with human beings is

00:33:15.399 --> 00:33:17.899
that they do not know what they want.

00:33:19.542 --> 00:33:21.859
They think they want first of all money.

00:33:22.885 --> 00:33:24.432
But those who have money,

00:33:24.702 --> 00:33:26.127
they think they must have power.

00:33:26.363 --> 00:33:28.902
If they have too much money, they think that they must go into politics

00:33:29.328 --> 00:33:31.030
because they have had no power.

00:33:31.626 --> 00:33:35.117
Then they fail in politics, or say they become too much in politics,

00:33:35.166 --> 00:33:39.963
whatever it is, then they want love from their children

00:33:40.159 --> 00:33:43.476
which they can't get, because they are too busy or something like that.

00:33:45.666 --> 00:33:47.072
So they don't know what they want.

00:33:49.532 --> 00:33:52.991
Those who believe that by having money will be better off,

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:56.123
should listen to all these people who have come from affluent countries

00:33:56.152 --> 00:33:57.151
and they will tell you

00:33:57.414 --> 00:33:59.180
how things have gone wrong there,

00:33:59.251 --> 00:34:01.701
how people are ruined, what's going wrong with them,

00:34:01.805 --> 00:34:04.365
absolutely they are in a bad shape.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.762
You cannot call them human beings

00:34:09.167 --> 00:34:12.311
because they are so cruel, they kill even their own children,

00:34:12.619 --> 00:34:14.702
and that society tolerates such people.

00:34:15.519 --> 00:34:17.456
In India if you hear somebody

00:34:17.697 --> 00:34:18.358
killing a child,

00:34:18.388 --> 00:34:21.352
I have never heard so far in the sixty years of My life,

00:34:21.734 --> 00:34:25.833
but supposing you hear someone has killed his daughter or son,

00:34:26.013 --> 00:34:28.401
nobody will ever look at that person.

00:34:28.417 --> 00:34:31.435
He will not be allowed in the society, nobody will even

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:36.423
give any girl in the marriage to

00:34:36.968 --> 00:34:40.740
his daughter or a son. He'll be absolutely barred from the society.

00:34:41.791 --> 00:34:45.847
No one can think of such a relationship between children and parents.

00:34:46.946 --> 00:34:49.152
And then there are funny relationships also,

00:34:49.472 --> 00:34:50.944
it's something so absurd,

00:34:51.184 --> 00:34:54.487
on both the sides on cruelty and on morality,

00:34:54.575 --> 00:34:57.913
they are so absurd, it's impossible to understand.

00:34:58.669 --> 00:35:02.391
So money has given this ego and they say, “What's wrong?

00:35:03.952 --> 00:35:07.267
What’s wrong?” It's absolutely malignant attitude.

00:35:07.719 --> 00:35:09.382
When you say, “What's wrong?” that means

00:35:09.756 --> 00:35:12.422
you do not want to keep your relationship with the whole.

00:35:14.435 --> 00:35:16.699
You do not want to keep your relationship

00:35:17.112 --> 00:35:24.678
with the Primordial One, the One who has you,

00:35:25.226 --> 00:35:29.304
everyone within Himself. You are part and parcel of the whole,

00:35:29.452 --> 00:35:31.126
and how can you say, “What's wrong?

00:35:31.235 --> 00:35:34.998
I do what I like.” You just become like a malignant cell.

00:35:37.518 --> 00:35:40.671
So at the Nabhi Chakra one has to know

00:35:41.135 --> 00:35:44.839
that one should not hanker after money too much.

00:35:46.135 --> 00:35:48.724
Now those who hanker too much after money,

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:56.855
may develop their right side better, they may have money, no doubt.

00:35:57.821 --> 00:36:02.210
But they miss their left side. Left side is Gruha Lakshmi,

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:05.416
they have no Gruha Lakshmi in their house.

00:36:05.721 --> 00:36:08.639
They are very hectic people, they run about,

00:36:08.726 --> 00:36:11.524
they run the rat race, they get heart attacks,

00:36:11.825 --> 00:36:15.109
if not heart attacks, they will get leukemia,

00:36:15.485 --> 00:36:19.775
they'll get diabetes, liver, all such things,

00:36:22.702 --> 00:36:26.410
because their attention is on money and not on God.

00:36:26.982 --> 00:36:29.596
So either you are on the right or on the left.

00:36:33.452 --> 00:36:35.452
Those who are very emotional people,

00:36:35.661 --> 00:36:39.419
extremely emotional, more worried about their family;

00:36:39.487 --> 00:36:41.446
for them family is everything,

00:36:41.541 --> 00:36:44.262
the relations are everything, they are like that,

00:36:44.357 --> 00:36:46.801
they may not have so much of Lakshmi because they distribute

00:36:46.878 --> 00:36:52.715
all the Lakshmi. But still they are better people. But sometimes

00:36:53.205 --> 00:36:54.588
such people who sacrifice

00:36:54.636 --> 00:36:56.121
so much for others,

00:36:56.599 --> 00:36:59.698
give up everything that they have, can become crazy

00:37:00.046 --> 00:37:03.524
because they’ll find people do not reciprocate,

00:37:03.946 --> 00:37:05.677
they do not return their love,

00:37:05.949 --> 00:37:07.965
they do not understand what they have done.

00:37:08.146 --> 00:37:11.563
So going to the extreme of helping others can cause

00:37:11.607 --> 00:37:15.380
trouble to the person who does this job, and also trouble to people

00:37:15.544 --> 00:37:17.276
who have taken free money from him,

00:37:17.376 --> 00:37:20.602
because if you distribute free money to people what will happen?

00:37:20.979 --> 00:37:24.648
I'll give you a simple example of America helping India.

00:37:26.885 --> 00:37:29.104
When Americans helped India,

00:37:29.252 --> 00:37:31.702
they thought they were doing a great favor to Indians,

00:37:31.929 --> 00:37:34.584
which was a wrong thing. Because whatever they did

00:37:34.639 --> 00:37:37.933
whatever they did was lost in the wilderness.

00:37:38.361 --> 00:37:40.584
Nobody tried to maintain it, it was free.

00:37:43.084 --> 00:37:45.432
But by giving that they showed the contempt,

00:37:47.734 --> 00:37:51.398
and when they gave some wheat and rice to India

00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.837
there was no grace about it, because

00:37:54.084 --> 00:37:56.747
then put some sort of a seed in it

00:37:56.859 --> 00:37:59.913
which creted two horrible things in the villages.

00:38:00.321 --> 00:38:02.727
One was called as congress grass

00:38:03.282 --> 00:38:04.961
because it came from America.

00:38:05.604 --> 00:38:10.643
And another was called as a mad acacia.

00:38:11.465 --> 00:38:15.629
Babool, as we call it, mad babool. These trees

00:38:15.886 --> 00:38:17.957
have gown so much in the villages

00:38:17.979 --> 00:38:19.784
that they don't know what to do with them.

00:38:20.024 --> 00:38:23.422
They have such big, big thorns that anyone who is stung by them

00:38:23.838 --> 00:38:26.324
can even die. They are very poisonous

00:38:26.894 --> 00:38:28.407
and if the children get it,

00:38:28.459 --> 00:38:33.051
they get such poisonous problems that they cannot be cured.

00:38:33.332 --> 00:38:36.224
This is how American government has helped us.

00:38:36.289 --> 00:38:39.992
Now who's going to tell them what you have done so ungraciously?

00:38:40.233 --> 00:38:43.619
It was better to starve than to get any help from anyone.

00:38:45.042 --> 00:38:49.099
Long time back I had said that it is better to starve in this country

00:38:49.847 --> 00:38:52.922
than to get any help from these wretched, horrible

00:38:53.332 --> 00:38:56.429
Western countries who think no end of themselves.

00:38:57.407 --> 00:38:59.718
You just pamper their ego for nothing at all.

00:39:00.149 --> 00:39:03.130
What have they got? They have just plastic affluence.

00:39:03.769 --> 00:39:07.123
But this ego out of money makes them so stupid

00:39:08.168 --> 00:39:11.221
that they don't know what's happening in their own country.

00:39:11.612 --> 00:39:14.067
How their country’s going down in every way.

00:39:14.641 --> 00:39:17.203
How their people are going down. Either they are in

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.068
fear or they are abandoned.

00:39:20.022 --> 00:39:22.022
Otherwise they are communist

00:39:22.221 --> 00:39:25.398
or they are so-called capitalist

00:39:25.512 --> 00:39:27.061
where they are just abandoned.

00:39:27.808 --> 00:39:29.507
If you go and see that country,

00:39:29.996 --> 00:39:33.392
I mean you can't sit like this anywhere and talk in the outside,

00:39:33.444 --> 00:39:36.484
somebody might come and murder somebody.

00:39:36.699 --> 00:39:38.887
If you walk in the dark you can be murdered.

00:39:38.983 --> 00:39:42.904
In America, so called advanced country of America, in New York City.

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:49.487
So this kind of riches we are trying to aspire, especially

00:39:49.767 --> 00:39:52.975
people in Delhi are very anxious to aspire lot of money.

00:39:54.833 --> 00:39:57.770
I don't know why Punjabis, Gujaratis

00:39:58.366 --> 00:40:00.289
and Maarwadis have taken to this.

00:40:00.436 --> 00:40:01.758
Maarwadis are another style.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:07.389
How the Punjabis and the Gujaratis

00:40:08.209 --> 00:40:10.309
are trying to acquire the money.

00:40:11.757 --> 00:40:14.123
And when I see them abroad I

00:40:14.236 --> 00:40:17.043
just don't know if they are anywhere near India.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:24.037
Horrid people they. They have no culture left in them that is Indian.

00:40:24.462 --> 00:40:26.160
They are absolutely outward.

00:40:27.715 --> 00:40:29.153
They think no end of themselves,

00:40:29.201 --> 00:40:31.712
they think they have reached the heavens.

00:40:33.027 --> 00:40:35.260
Then if you see their Nabhi Chakra,

00:40:35.364 --> 00:40:38.614
you'll be amazed, all of them suffer from horrible livers,

00:40:38.917 --> 00:40:43.242
high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attacks

00:40:43.684 --> 00:40:47.061
and they drink like fish, especially Sardargis.

00:40:47.197 --> 00:40:51.867
I was surprised who are supposed to be in the name of God,

00:40:52.488 --> 00:40:54.563
they drink like fish.

00:40:56.226 --> 00:40:59.073
They are very particular about wearing a Puggadi and a Dhari,

00:40:59.108 --> 00:41:00.703
but while drinking they don't mind.

00:41:01.248 --> 00:41:04.798
Every Sardargi you go to has a big bar in his house,

00:41:05.031 --> 00:41:06.192
where even a lord

00:41:06.213 --> 00:41:08.586
does not have because it is regarded as very vulgar in England.

00:41:09.631 --> 00:41:12.607
Without learning any aesthetics of that country,

00:41:13.587 --> 00:41:17.644
they have become just like a agriculture there is no culture

00:41:22.268 --> 00:41:23.469
is the fact,

00:41:24.363 --> 00:41:26.660
this is what money has done to them, they have

00:41:26.793 --> 00:41:28.290
no respect for themselves.

00:41:29.429 --> 00:41:33.452
So this Lakshmi Tattwa is to be balanced. Same about these

00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:35.515
Gujaratis who have gone.

00:41:35.757 --> 00:41:37.858
Another kind lives here, the Maarwadis.

00:41:37.931 --> 00:41:40.384
Less said the better about these horrible Maarwadis.

00:41:41.366 --> 00:41:44.152
I don't think anyone of them will ever get Realization

00:41:44.325 --> 00:41:46.325
or a place in the Kingdom of God.

00:41:49.366 --> 00:41:50.829
They are blood suckers.

00:41:53.738 --> 00:41:56.786
They are not human beings. For money's sake, they'll

00:41:56.939 --> 00:42:01.611
suck the blood like juice, suck the blood, and now they had a nice time.

00:42:05.844 --> 00:42:10.625
This is not a world for you to seek money.

00:42:11.064 --> 00:42:13.211
You have come on this earth as a human being

00:42:13.256 --> 00:42:17.505
to seek God, to seek your Spirit, to be one with your Self,

00:42:17.816 --> 00:42:19.816
to be in that peaceful place

00:42:20.818 --> 00:42:25.221
which is the Kingdom of God, which is the Kingdom of Heaven,

00:42:25.772 --> 00:42:28.694
and not to jump into a mire

00:42:28.874 --> 00:42:30.304
which looks very beautiful

00:42:32.067 --> 00:42:39.325
but is not really beautiful. It's agonizing, it's terrorizing.

00:42:39.441 --> 00:42:42.177
People can't sleep if they have too much money,

00:42:42.678 --> 00:42:44.578
because they don't know what to do with that.

00:42:44.608 --> 00:42:46.858
Here also all those who have got money,

00:42:47.267 --> 00:42:49.697
they don't know when the income tax will come on them.

00:42:51.146 --> 00:42:54.627
I have solved My income tax problem by having no income at all.

00:42:58.115 --> 00:42:59.812
I have no income, no income tax,

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:03.185
so I'm not worried about the Income Tax Commissioner.

00:43:03.776 --> 00:43:05.407
He cannot control Me.

00:43:07.689 --> 00:43:10.162
Best is not to have more income

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.487
that is to be taxed, otherwise you’ll have

00:43:12.507 --> 00:43:13.924
to have another income tax

00:43:16.732 --> 00:43:18.847
lawyer that My brother is.

00:43:19.152 --> 00:43:23.182
I told him, “I don't need you at all, all My life, thank you very much.”

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:30.813
You get so absolutely free, on top of the world if you have no income.

00:43:33.653 --> 00:43:40.653
Like if you want to solve your car problem, never learn driving.

00:43:41.211 --> 00:43:46.953
Somebody drives you down or nothing, you can walk with your feet.

00:43:48.233 --> 00:43:50.922
The accumulation of all these nonsensical things

00:43:51.315 --> 00:43:54.147
have caused us all this tension, so-called:

00:43:56.396 --> 00:43:59.768
“How much we have to pay, what is the income tax,

00:44:00.091 --> 00:44:02.991
tomorrow the police is going to come in my house?”

00:44:03.520 --> 00:44:05.289
If they come to Me I'll say, “All right,

00:44:05.483 --> 00:44:08.059
have everything that you can. Nothing there,

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:14.530
certain bills which I have not paid, that's all.” Just let them pay.

00:44:17.438 --> 00:44:20.213
One has to live with complete freedom in this world.

00:44:20.882 --> 00:44:24.653
And to achieve that freedom, one has to know that

00:44:24.752 --> 00:44:28.442
the priorities should be all right. If money is your priority,

00:44:28.618 --> 00:44:34.740
you have it. No, not Me. If you want to give Me money,

00:44:34.934 --> 00:44:37.974
“No Sir,” I won't at any cost.

00:44:38.216 --> 00:44:42.495
You can give Me flowers, this, that, all right, but no money at all.

00:44:44.354 --> 00:44:48.820
I don't want to know about money at all, it's a headache.

00:44:51.733 --> 00:44:59.940
In the same way, we do not realize that having relationships -

00:45:00.823 --> 00:45:05.553
brother, sister or son, this and that - is another big headache.

00:45:08.088 --> 00:45:10.222
That doesn't mean that you should start beating them,

00:45:11.025 --> 00:45:15.461
but people can sell their country for the sake of their children.

00:45:18.435 --> 00:45:22.085
It’s a very dangerous thing, horrible,

00:45:22.804 --> 00:45:25.254
that kind of an attachment, the mamatva (ownership).

00:45:25.399 --> 00:45:27.399
This is my son, finished.

00:45:27.885 --> 00:45:30.696
If he's your son then you can murder anyone you feel like,

00:45:30.727 --> 00:45:33.362
you can do what you like because he is your son.

00:45:33.408 --> 00:45:36.284
He is not somebody's son whom you are murdering?

00:45:38.514 --> 00:45:41.088
This mamatva that comes - “My husband.”

00:45:41.118 --> 00:45:42.362
Specially our Indian women.

00:45:43.636 --> 00:45:47.632
“My husband” immediately starts problem.

00:45:51.616 --> 00:45:58.616
All this comes out of ignorance. Of course, love has to be there.

00:45:59.462 --> 00:46:01.462
But love never gives you attachment,

00:46:02.691 --> 00:46:10.729
because it is wise, it is wisdom. Supposing in a tree the sap of the tree

00:46:10.846 --> 00:46:15.745
goes and gets fixed in one fruit because it loves. “It's mine.”

00:46:16.179 --> 00:46:19.076
Then what happens to the rest of the tree? It dies

00:46:19.477 --> 00:46:21.002
and that fruit also dies.

00:46:25.255 --> 00:46:27.332
So this mamatva has to go out.

00:46:28.098 --> 00:46:29.993
But by telling it will not go,

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:34.234
by just advising it will not go.

00:46:34.306 --> 00:46:37.344
Even if you suffer, I have seen so many people coming to Me,

00:46:37.734 --> 00:46:41.043
“My own father deceived me.

00:46:41.624 --> 00:46:45.353
My own son deceived me.” I said, “Which one is your own?

00:46:45.953 --> 00:46:48.927
The one who deceived you is not your own.”

00:46:51.386 --> 00:46:52.841
“My husband.”

00:46:53.278 --> 00:46:56.416
There are some ladies who eat My head out of their husbands.

00:46:58.053 --> 00:47:02.795
“My husband did this, my husband did this, my husband did this.”

00:47:03.315 --> 00:47:06.073
Baba, why don't you hit him hard and finish with it?

00:47:09.347 --> 00:47:18.359
But it's so much accepted, this mamatva, this attachment.

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:25.359
Attachment to money, attachment to people, attachment to this

00:47:26.119 --> 00:47:33.930
is nothing but a hook which hooks you to baser levels.

00:47:34.872 --> 00:47:44.045
You have to rise above, and then you really enjoy the beauty of richness.

00:47:44.958 --> 00:47:48.889
As I told you the other day, I see all beautiful things.

00:47:48.921 --> 00:47:52.627
It's nice I don't possess them. See now these carpets are spread here.

00:47:53.410 --> 00:47:56.466
If they were Mine, I should worry, “Oh God, now

00:47:56.852 --> 00:47:58.852
I hope they are not going to be spoilt.

00:47:59.567 --> 00:48:01.602
I hope nobody sits on them.

00:48:02.713 --> 00:48:07.427
I hope they are insured, so nobody runs away with that.”

00:48:07.685 --> 00:48:10.525
But when they don't belong to Me, I'm enjoying them better.

00:48:12.295 --> 00:48:14.734
Other people's things is a better idea.

00:48:16.389 --> 00:48:22.338
This myth carries us to such an extent of stupidity

00:48:24.219 --> 00:48:28.663
that sometimes I feel whether these human beings are human beings,

00:48:28.746 --> 00:48:33.495
or they are their possessions. Their Spirit is lost,

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:39.092
everything is lost, they're not bothered.

00:48:40.077 --> 00:48:44.629
But if their little position is lost, they weep and wail,

00:48:44.852 --> 00:48:48.845
as if they are dead, their forefathers are dead hundred times.

00:48:53.208 --> 00:48:57.246
But people like Me are just batchas, emperors.

00:48:57.739 --> 00:49:04.462
They are not bothered. To them comfort cannot capture,

00:49:05.369 --> 00:49:09.326
they don’t need any comfort. If you have comfort

00:49:09.904 --> 00:49:12.988
it crawls upon you, it makes you a slave, too.

00:49:13.384 --> 00:49:17.750
If you seek comfort you are in for enslavement,

00:49:18.276 --> 00:49:21.247
take it from Me. Any kind of comfort.

00:49:25.039 --> 00:49:28.108
It's only human beings who can become really so crazy.

00:49:28.411 --> 00:49:32.507
No animal can become. There is another type of a comfort,

00:49:33.163 --> 00:49:38.550
is that a mental idea

00:49:38.759 --> 00:49:41.010
that everybody must appreciate,

00:49:41.261 --> 00:49:44.723
and that you should be able to overpower others.

00:49:44.977 --> 00:49:47.598
This also comes I think from Nabhi Chakra.

00:49:49.114 --> 00:49:50.754
Is a kind of a feeling

00:49:50.894 --> 00:49:53.473
that you should be able to overpower many people,

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:54.384
they should look at you.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:58.200
These days in London there are women who are suffering from

00:49:58.309 --> 00:50:00.941
a funny disease called anorexia, where they just don't eat.

00:50:02.707 --> 00:50:06.408
Women just don't eat because they should be thin and skinny.

00:50:06.434 --> 00:50:09.107
For what? For what you should be thin and skinny?

00:50:10.436 --> 00:50:12.837
Because you look attractive, but for what?

00:50:15.843 --> 00:50:18.690
I don't think skinny people look attractive by any chance.

00:50:19.547 --> 00:50:22.572
Horrible they are. They create only pity

00:50:22.659 --> 00:50:26.418
and you feel you know repulsive about the whole stuff.

00:50:27.754 --> 00:50:32.817
Once a beauty queen came to see Me. I thought she was a T.B. patient.

00:50:36.332 --> 00:50:40.912
And I said, “You look all right but it seems you are a T.B. patient.”

00:50:40.987 --> 00:50:44.227
She said, “No Mother, I've got a beauty prize.” “Yes?

00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:48.007
Who were the people? Doctors must have given it

00:50:48.254 --> 00:50:49.863
because they want some patients there.”

00:50:51.609 --> 00:50:52.640
This is the trouble,

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:56.124
we go out of the way to trouble our Nabhi,

00:50:57.272 --> 00:50:59.562
not to eat your food, fasting.

00:51:00.472 --> 00:51:05.099
If you want to fast this life, next life you will not have any food.

00:51:05.465 --> 00:51:08.970
Thank you very much. No food.

00:51:09.597 --> 00:51:13.416
Fasting? All right, you’ll have a permanent fasting. What do you say?

00:51:14.006 --> 00:51:17.788
You don't have to do any fasting. Why do you want to fast?

00:51:18.361 --> 00:51:20.107
And even if you want to fast

00:51:20.406 --> 00:51:25.051
because you want to change the timing or maybe

00:51:25.345 --> 00:51:26.875
for your health's sake, it's all right.

00:51:27.123 --> 00:51:30.717
But why in the name of God you want to malign Me?

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:33.540
You have got everything to eat and you don’t want to eat.

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:36.448
Those who have got food to eat, they don’t want to eat.

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:40.967
Next life they become poor and then they blame the rich.

00:51:41.914 --> 00:51:44.439
But in last life you'd been wanted to fast,

00:51:46.252 --> 00:51:50.178
so this life you are not given any food, because you asked for it.

00:51:52.922 --> 00:51:56.159
And that is how also the Nabhi Chakra gets you twisted,

00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:57.794
when you fast like mad.

00:51:58.651 --> 00:52:01.526
There is no need to fast in the name of God.

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:05.515
God has given you all the wealth, all the beauty,

00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:11.021
all the love. Actually in Sahaja Yoga

00:52:11.092 --> 00:52:15.374
if you fast in My name, I think it's horrible

00:52:15.624 --> 00:52:18.926
because if you want to trouble your Mother

00:52:18.987 --> 00:52:20.836
or to make Her uneasy,

00:52:21.183 --> 00:52:22.699
or to take a revenge on Her,

00:52:23.124 --> 00:52:25.087
then you say, “Mother, I'm not going to eat my food.”

00:52:25.226 --> 00:52:27.965
Then Mother is finished. That's the best way to conquer Her.

00:52:28.367 --> 00:52:30.566
To say, “Mother I'm not going to eat my food.”

00:52:31.298 --> 00:52:34.497
So this kind of a mad fasting

00:52:34.602 --> 00:52:38.649
is also very bad for your Nabhi and when you do that

00:52:38.744 --> 00:52:41.500
then you have a problem because you are invaded

00:52:41.737 --> 00:52:45.497
by your left-sided, what you call, beyond

00:52:48.608 --> 00:52:53.059
the Ida Nadi, you have the collective subconscious;

00:52:53.734 --> 00:52:55.734
and you are invaded by them.

00:52:57.384 --> 00:53:02.784
And you are in for trouble, physically, mentally, emotionally.

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:07.119
And mostly those people who fast are very hot tempered.

00:53:08.501 --> 00:53:11.340
The day they are fasting day is there, never go near them.

00:53:12.693 --> 00:53:15.039
Because they are already planning what they are going to eat.

00:53:19.631 --> 00:53:22.991
And in the morning they plan and they don't get it,

00:53:23.332 --> 00:53:25.557
so they are very angry for that part.

00:53:27.693 --> 00:53:30.779
All these asahaja things are not going to help you.

00:53:31.057 --> 00:53:32.561
You have to be normal people.

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:36.956
You don't have to put up into tension yourself for Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

00:53:37.166 --> 00:53:42.201
Be normal. Be nice people. Don't torture yourself.

00:53:42.427 --> 00:53:45.060
That is one point on the Nabhi on the left hand side

00:53:45.442 --> 00:53:48.329
and on the right hand side: don't get into indulgences.

00:53:50.047 --> 00:53:51.366
Don't pamper yourself.

00:53:52.051 --> 00:53:54.353
Both things are the same for Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:54.536 --> 00:53:57.985
Whether you starve or you overeat, is the same.

00:53:59.109 --> 00:54:02.635
There is no difference between the two, because

00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:04.500
if you are not on the seat,

00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:05.745
whether you are on the left

00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:07.770
falling on the right, does it make any difference?

00:54:10.342 --> 00:54:13.298
So to be on the seat is to be

00:54:13.849 --> 00:54:16.276
in the blessings of Shri Lakshmi.

00:54:16.407 --> 00:54:20.185
And I have described to you how Shri Lakshmi is a lady

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:26.537
and in Her left hand She has got two lotuses and the right,

00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:32.081
one lotus, and right hand another lotus on top, which shows a person

00:54:33.416 --> 00:54:37.076
who is balancing. She’s balancing on a lotus.

00:54:37.654 --> 00:54:40.978
Imagine. She’s standing on a lotus. That means She is balancing.

00:54:43.697 --> 00:54:45.697
And She’s balancing, She’s standing there

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:53.208
and She is holding two lotuses in Her hand showing

00:54:53.898 --> 00:54:56.747
that She’s like a lotus.

00:54:58.521 --> 00:55:02.641
A person who is a rich man, Lakshmi Pati,

00:55:03.314 --> 00:55:07.655
has to be like a lotus, warm, pink, warm.

00:55:08.368 --> 00:55:11.625
And even a horrible thing, like

00:55:18.912 --> 00:55:20.619
wasp-like thing.

00:55:20.841 --> 00:55:23.551
I don’t know what you call it in English, you don’t have that black thing.

00:55:24.053 --> 00:55:26.719
We have a very black wasp, you see,

00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:32.074
which is hard, hard like nut and has angular thorny legs.

00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:36.303
That black thing comes in

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:41.571
and is good for nothing, but it comes in

00:55:43.439 --> 00:55:46.545
for the residence, for the ashraya,

00:55:47.095 --> 00:55:50.110
the lotus keeps it

00:55:50.631 --> 00:55:55.269
on top of it’s corolla, which is a very, very soft thing, with all love.

00:55:55.566 --> 00:55:58.507
And in the night it closes down so that

00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:01.556
the poor insect who is just like a nut

00:56:01.991 --> 00:56:05.987
should not get any trouble from the outside weather.

00:56:07.003 --> 00:56:11.349
Like a mother who takes the child in the armchair,

00:56:12.726 --> 00:56:16.349
that love should be there for a Lakshmi Pati.

00:56:17.011 --> 00:56:19.723
How many are Lakshmi Pati’s like that? Have you seen any?

00:56:21.272 --> 00:56:25.690
If they see somebody who is coming with money propositions,

00:56:26.098 --> 00:56:27.728
then they may open their doors.

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:31.346
Otherwise, they have no love for anybody.

00:56:31.881 --> 00:56:37.038
For those who come for their ashrayas, for their help,

00:56:37.637 --> 00:56:41.699
they are not there. On the other side

00:56:42.003 --> 00:56:54.238
are the people who are so repulsive. They are not like lotus.

00:56:54.496 --> 00:56:58.510
There is no fragrance. They are such miserly people

00:56:59.682 --> 00:57:05.590
that they stink of miserliness. While the lotus

00:57:06.655 --> 00:57:12.761
gives its fragrance through that mud, to that horrible thing

00:57:13.446 --> 00:57:18.389
that even the little worms which crawl upon

00:57:19.908 --> 00:57:26.599
those lotus petals smell of this beautiful fragrance.

00:57:28.331 --> 00:57:31.536
This is what it has to be. It has to give.

00:57:32.303 --> 00:57:35.117
It has to be beautiful. It has to be cozy.

00:57:35.494 --> 00:57:36.971
It has to be welcoming.

00:57:38.843 --> 00:57:42.177
Then another hand is giving.

00:57:43.297 --> 00:57:45.954
The Lakshmi is always giving. She doesn’t receive;

00:57:46.209 --> 00:57:47.404
She just gives.

00:57:48.115 --> 00:57:49.987
If you are really a Lakshmi Pati

00:57:50.059 --> 00:57:52.005
you don’t want to have anything from anyone.

00:57:52.202 --> 00:57:57.477
You don’t receive. If you are really rich, who can enrich you more?

00:57:59.769 --> 00:58:03.734
What can you give to a person who is fully rich? There is no

00:58:04.194 --> 00:58:06.812
way of entering into it now it’s all up to the brim.

00:58:07.473 --> 00:58:09.689
He’s rich up to the brim. Then what do you give?

00:58:11.084 --> 00:58:12.058
You cannot give anything.

00:58:12.998 --> 00:58:15.632
But where you have to give means that he’s a beggar –

00:58:16.748 --> 00:58:17.636
he’s still a beggar.

00:58:20.045 --> 00:58:21.994
All of these so-called rich people

00:58:22.214 --> 00:58:23.810
who still are hankering money

00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:25.707
are still beggars, they are not rich.

00:58:26.177 --> 00:58:29.164
They may think themselves. Empty vessels, but they are not rich

00:58:29.698 --> 00:58:31.802
because they are still expecting money.

00:58:37.459 --> 00:58:44.459
So, it is important that we should understand,

00:58:46.418 --> 00:58:48.099
the money is not the way.

00:58:48.377 --> 00:58:50.562
Money takes us away from dharma.

00:58:50.751 --> 00:58:52.488
It takes us away from God.

00:58:52.521 --> 00:58:55.639
It takes us away from reality. It covers our eyes.

00:58:56.379 --> 00:58:57.363
We don’t think

00:58:58.056 --> 00:59:02.699
that we have to follow a path of righteousness and of virtue

00:59:03.436 --> 00:59:06.129
because we think we are rich, God is going to be afraid of us.

00:59:06.359 --> 00:59:08.710
We can even purchase Him and can

00:59:08.831 --> 00:59:10.483
manage Him by giving some bribes.

00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:13.552
That’s not so.

00:59:15.209 --> 00:59:18.723
You must face yourself. You have to face yourself.

00:59:19.557 --> 00:59:24.187
That it’s not the money that’s going to give you that elation,

00:59:25.198 --> 00:59:33.974
that higher life, but it is the love of God,

00:59:34.306 --> 00:59:38.307
the honesty of seeking, honesty.

00:59:39.568 --> 00:59:44.306
That is the quality of this chakra is the Satya,

00:59:45.441 --> 00:59:47.950
Vishnu, is the Satya.

00:59:48.576 --> 00:59:51.292
He’s the Narayana. Narayana means Satya.

00:59:52.533 --> 00:59:54.863
So there cannot be Satya Narayan, isn’t it?

00:59:55.554 --> 00:59:58.307
Narayan is Satya, then how can there be Satya Narayan?

00:59:58.850 --> 01:00:00.850
But we have many Satya Narayana Pujas.

01:00:02.164 --> 01:00:05.819
For all these Satya Narayanas, Sahaja Yogis are not supposed to go.

01:00:06.931 --> 01:00:09.188
They can only go to Narayana Puja

01:00:09.845 --> 01:00:13.660
because Satya Narayana is that path which is added to it

01:00:14.693 --> 01:00:17.359
for camouflaging, is meant for these

01:00:17.436 --> 01:00:21.618
horrible Brahmins who make you pay. For what?

01:00:25.003 --> 01:00:29.126
Sahaja Yogis are not allowed to go to Satya Narayana Puja.

01:00:29.434 --> 01:00:34.506
They can have Narayana Puja. And what is Narayana ultimately becomes?

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:43.167
In the Nabhi Chakra Narayana existed since He was created by the Devi.

01:00:45.082 --> 01:00:46.557
And It looks after

01:00:48.595 --> 01:00:52.138
the seeking, the nourishing of the seeking like a father,

01:00:53.117 --> 01:00:57.764
and then It incarnates again and then It incarnates again

01:00:57.836 --> 01:01:01.762
to help our seeking to a higher position and a higher position

01:01:02.533 --> 01:01:10.287
till it reaches a point where you start seeking God Almighty.

01:01:11.107 --> 01:01:16.067
Then you jump into the Shakti of Mahalakshmi.

01:01:16.505 --> 01:01:20.743
Then you are in the hands of Mahalakshmi Shakti.

01:01:21.241 --> 01:01:25.481
Means Lakshmi evolves into Mahalakshmi principle.

01:01:29.365 --> 01:01:36.365
Now this Mahalakshmi principle resides in the central path of Sushumna.

01:01:37.826 --> 01:01:47.131
And this central path of Sushumna is to be established fully

01:01:47.550 --> 01:01:50.191
and awakened when the Kundalini rises.

01:01:50.972 --> 01:01:52.972
When the Kundalini does not rise,

01:01:53.225 --> 01:01:56.413
this path is kept absolutely black.

01:01:58.787 --> 01:02:04.509
It is absolutely black, there is nothing in it except for the deities

01:02:05.442 --> 01:02:08.574
who are lying without any light.

01:02:10.433 --> 01:02:15.068
When the Kundalini rises, then only these deities get awakened

01:02:15.958 --> 01:02:19.327
and when they get awakened this Sushumna path,

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:25.573
this central path of Mahalakshmi starts acting

01:02:27.281 --> 01:02:32.069
as the balancing power, to begin with at the Nabhi chakra.

01:02:33.336 --> 01:02:38.853
So Nabhi Chakra is surrounded by ten Gurus, the Prophets

01:02:39.310 --> 01:02:41.139
who give you the balance,

01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:45.310
who come on this earth again and again to give you balance in life.

01:02:46.183 --> 01:02:49.001
They tell you, “don’t do this, don’t do that.”

01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:53.451
But we don’t listen, we don’t accept it. We may say

01:02:53.585 --> 01:02:56.130
that we follow such guru, such guru. Like,

01:02:56.241 --> 01:02:59.576
you know Muslims are. They say, “We follow Mohammed Sahib.”

01:03:00.143 --> 01:03:01.876
Now if Mohammed Sahib has said

01:03:02.121 --> 01:03:05.744
anything it is that don’t drink, is the thing he said.

01:03:06.226 --> 01:03:09.006
But I’ve yet to come across a Muslim who doesn’t drink.

01:03:09.495 --> 01:03:12.186
They may not drink in Riyad because they’ll be killed there.

01:03:12.983 --> 01:03:14.889
But if they come to London, they drink.

01:03:14.911 --> 01:03:16.209
Actually, when My husband

01:03:16.728 --> 01:03:18.477
went to Saudi Arabia they said,

01:03:18.519 --> 01:03:20.494
“You are the only Muslim we have ever come across.”

01:03:21.808 --> 01:03:27.181
It’s true. Whatever is said to them, they do just the opposite of that.

01:03:27.812 --> 01:03:30.639
At that time there were no cigarettes, no tobaccos,

01:03:30.755 --> 01:03:31.943
so He didn’t say about that

01:03:32.037 --> 01:03:33.191
so they have found a loophole.

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:37.011
Muslims smoke, doesn’t matter, because Mohammed Sahib never said.

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.276
Mohammed Sahib had to take another birth

01:03:40.302 --> 01:03:42.698
to come as Guru Nanaka to tell them, “Oh, God.

01:03:43.706 --> 01:03:48.778
Now you are smoking this horrible thing has come, now you don’t smoke.”

01:03:50.196 --> 01:03:55.189
But who will accept that Nanaka and Mohammed Sahib were the same people?

01:03:55.750 --> 01:04:02.750
No difference. Same thing it was. We can prove it in Sahaja Yoga.

01:04:04.498 --> 01:04:09.201
We can prove it, how important it is that we should know

01:04:09.574 --> 01:04:11.115
that they were all the same,

01:04:11.829 --> 01:04:13.913
and that they stood for the same thing,

01:04:14.277 --> 01:04:15.657
but at a period.

01:04:15.738 --> 01:04:18.251
Now today you have got ganja,

01:04:18.377 --> 01:04:20.955
I don’t know the names also of all these things what you

01:04:21.104 --> 01:04:21.798
drink and smoke,

01:04:21.847 --> 01:04:22.752
God knows what.

01:04:23.441 --> 01:04:25.132
Human beings are really clever

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:27.915
to get everything that can destroy you. It's like,

01:04:28.111 --> 01:04:30.717
call a bull, “come and hit me.” It's like that. If there’s

01:04:30.726 --> 01:04:33.164
not a bull then you’ll like ask a buffalo, “come and hit me.”

01:04:33.223 --> 01:04:35.181
Now there's no buffalo, all right,

01:04:35.306 --> 01:04:38.685
you ask an elephant, “come and stampede me.” It's like that.

01:04:38.906 --> 01:04:40.318
Human beings are so stupid.

01:04:40.891 --> 01:04:42.335
So now supposing, I say

01:04:42.356 --> 01:04:43.896
if I write down a list of

01:04:43.919 --> 01:04:46.582
all the thing you drink and smoke, I don't know how many things

01:04:46.608 --> 01:04:47.700
there are in this world,

01:04:48.035 --> 01:04:50.624
then you'll find out the third thing when I die,

01:04:50.715 --> 01:04:54.337
that “Mataji didn't say this one.” So we should do it.

01:04:55.452 --> 01:05:00.591
Very intelligent. All the time destroying your central path,

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:04.561
and nicely managing through that.

01:05:05.005 --> 01:05:07.877
Is this the way are you going to go to God by any chance?

01:05:09.334 --> 01:05:11.170
Is this the way are you following

01:05:11.443 --> 01:05:14.016
the great incarnations who came on this earth?

01:05:17.347 --> 01:05:20.882
So the balancing comes through Nabhi

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:28.474
and Nabhi looks after you and teaches you how to behave.

01:05:29.049 --> 01:05:33.282
For example, now your left Nabhi is Gruha Lakshmi.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.065
Gruha Lakshmi is the Deity of the household.

01:05:38.333 --> 01:05:40.333
But if you have too much outward type,

01:05:40.739 --> 01:05:41.896
you're running a madness.

01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:45.499
So early in the morning you get up, read the newspapers.

01:05:45.687 --> 01:05:47.082
Is against Sahaja Yoga again.

01:05:47.574 --> 01:05:50.021
Not to read newspapers in the morning time.

01:05:50.161 --> 01:05:51.690
You can read it in the night,

01:05:53.325 --> 01:05:56.131
but not in the morning. Because if you read it in the morning,

01:05:56.846 --> 01:05:57.793
you'll get upset.

01:05:58.968 --> 01:06:00.679
And poor this spleen has to

01:06:00.706 --> 01:06:03.550
pour in more red blood corpuscles

01:06:03.794 --> 01:06:05.587
and it becomes mad and fails you.

01:06:07.036 --> 01:06:09.357
On the contrary, in the morning talk to your wife,

01:06:09.613 --> 01:06:10.705
talk to your children,

01:06:10.803 --> 01:06:12.690
look after your Gruha Lakshmi Tattwa.

01:06:12.748 --> 01:06:14.931
The wife also has to be a Gruha Lakshmi as I told you.

01:06:16.704 --> 01:06:19.545
Then you have your food properly.

01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:23.549
Sit down and eat properly. But no,

01:06:24.022 --> 01:06:26.609
just after that, upsetting that Nabhi,

01:06:26.788 --> 01:06:28.219
you jump into your car,

01:06:28.596 --> 01:06:31.296
taking your breakfast in your hand, eating on the way,

01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:34.482
honking at people, getting angry with them,

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:38.674
the wife is calling, “Come along you have your breakfast!”

01:06:38.701 --> 01:06:42.590
Nothing doing. You are on your way on a special work,

01:06:43.021 --> 01:06:46.999
you end up with leukemia at least, minimum of minimum,

01:06:47.113 --> 01:06:48.838
if not with heart attack.

01:06:50.991 --> 01:06:55.217
Leukemia comes from left Nabhi, when your Gruha Lakshmi is ruined.

01:06:59.217 --> 01:07:01.898
The Deity of Gruha Lakshmi is Fatimabai,

01:07:02.011 --> 01:07:03.462
the daughter of Mohammed Sahib,

01:07:06.884 --> 01:07:13.884
while the daughter of the sister

01:07:14.876 --> 01:07:21.840
of Nanak Sahib is on the left Vishuddhi. You'll see that.

01:07:23.212 --> 01:07:29.882
Nanaki. Now this aspect of life we never think about.

01:07:30.049 --> 01:07:33.342
When you get leukemia, then you'll come to Mother, “please cure me.”

01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:34.408
And if you are rich,

01:07:34.496 --> 01:07:37.001
you will see to it that I cure that person.

01:07:37.027 --> 01:07:38.990
If I don't cure you will sit on My head.

01:07:39.877 --> 01:07:43.550
You'll be in ten times on My head unless and until I cure your leukemia.

01:07:43.605 --> 01:07:46.962
But if I tell you, “My son, you take it easy,

01:07:47.354 --> 01:07:50.480
life is not for getting wretchedness out of you.

01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:53.860
What have you gained out of all this running about?

01:07:54.179 --> 01:07:54.819
Nothing.

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.978
But this horrible left Nabhi

01:07:57.087 --> 01:08:00.286
by which you are suffering, your family people are suffering.

01:08:00.339 --> 01:08:01.714
Only person who has gained

01:08:01.962 --> 01:08:05.316
is the doctor or the doctors or the hospitals.”

01:08:07.687 --> 01:08:08.815
They won't listen.

01:08:10.765 --> 01:08:14.927
And you know leukemia is such a fast developing disease of cancer

01:08:15.158 --> 01:08:18.508
that one can pass out within one month,

01:08:19.375 --> 01:08:20.382
doctors will tell you,

01:08:20.562 --> 01:08:22.688
at the most you'll live for one month, that's all. They'll

01:08:22.815 --> 01:08:25.205
take all the money to give this certificate, very nicely.

01:08:26.591 --> 01:08:28.179
But why have that?

01:08:28.447 --> 01:08:30.447
Be patient with yourself.

01:08:30.681 --> 01:08:34.130
Be kind to your Nabhi, look after your Gruha Lakshmi.

01:08:36.171 --> 01:08:38.563
All kinds of diseases of the stomach

01:08:38.730 --> 01:08:42.498
come from this imbalance this way or that way.

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:45.811
All these great gurus came on this earth

01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:48.873
to give us balance, to teach us balance and tell us,

01:08:49.282 --> 01:08:53.453
“Don't do this and don't do that.” All the Ten Commandments.

01:08:54.305 --> 01:08:59.579
But to us these Ten Commandment have no meaning.

01:09:01.786 --> 01:09:05.006
Now I’ll touch a point which is very important today

01:09:05.613 --> 01:09:07.470
for you people to understand

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:11.132
about non-vegetarianism and vegetarianism.

01:09:11.281 --> 01:09:13.530
Because this subject I wanted to handle,

01:09:13.886 --> 01:09:15.513
because if they are vegetarians they

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:16.812
can’t bear to see

01:09:16.916 --> 01:09:19.500
that Mother says it doesn't matter if you are a non-vegetarian,

01:09:20.747 --> 01:09:24.682
because it doesn’t go against your awareness. It does not.

01:09:24.756 --> 01:09:29.162
But drinking does. Drinking does go against your awareness.

01:09:29.848 --> 01:09:36.134
But not eating meat or not eating meat. But one has to understand.

01:09:37.089 --> 01:09:41.793
Now somebody told Me that in Gita it is written that those who eat meat

01:09:43.224 --> 01:09:50.150
are Tamo Gunis. I am surprised at Gita itself.

01:09:50.247 --> 01:09:54.136
Because Shri Krishna Himself in the very beginning,

01:09:54.755 --> 01:10:00.185
has told Arjuna that you should go all out to kill all these people,

01:10:00.611 --> 01:10:04.777
even your relations, kill, actually kill human beings.

01:10:05.122 --> 01:10:08.344
Your relations and your guru also is to be killed,

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:10.743
because I have already killed.

01:10:11.376 --> 01:10:15.151
Nothing is going to be killed by you because they are already killed.

01:10:17.302 --> 01:10:20.795
And He gives so many explanations that it should not be done,

01:10:21.487 --> 01:10:24.924
but He said, “No, I tell you, you have to go and kill.

01:10:25.124 --> 01:10:27.092
Surrender yourself to Me and I'll take care of them.”

01:10:27.479 --> 01:10:30.937
So how did He preach this, I just don’t understand, in Gita.

01:10:31.417 --> 01:10:33.486
Now this seems to be a new introduction

01:10:33.609 --> 01:10:36.927
that the people who eat (meat) are Tamo Gunis. They are not,

01:10:37.844 --> 01:10:39.987
they are never. They are Rajo Gunis.

01:10:41.045 --> 01:10:44.089
If you eat meat you become Rajo Gunis not Tamo Gunis.

01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:48.566
Tamo Gunis are the people who eat carbohydrates, we have seen it

01:10:48.649 --> 01:10:51.361
in Sahaja Yoga. We have two types of diseases,

01:10:51.404 --> 01:10:56.143
one is lethargic organs and one is active organs.

01:10:57.742 --> 01:11:04.739
So those who are lethargic having too much carbohydrates

01:11:05.743 --> 01:11:09.575
and those who are overactive are having too much proteins in them.

01:11:11.261 --> 01:11:15.270
I mean if you take proteins, in the science, scientifically,

01:11:15.359 --> 01:11:19.363
will you become lethargic? I mean ask any doctor.

01:11:20.586 --> 01:11:21.866
And then the doctor says Gita

01:11:21.879 --> 01:11:24.037
is all humbug because it doesn't understand

01:11:24.182 --> 01:11:25.184
what it is saying.

01:11:25.822 --> 01:11:28.497
And while you say like this that “We must follow Gita.”

01:11:29.672 --> 01:11:31.805
I think somebody has gone wrong there

01:11:31.834 --> 01:11:33.468
and has written something wrong in Gita

01:11:33.476 --> 01:11:36.344
as they have written in Bible, they have written in every book.

01:11:36.861 --> 01:11:38.395
I'll tell you what they have written wrong in

01:11:38.414 --> 01:11:40.414
Bible later on when it comes to Christ.

01:11:41.486 --> 01:11:45.835
I think just some people have put it there for oppose.

01:11:46.029 --> 01:11:48.029
If you eat too much meat you get Raj Gunis

01:11:48.666 --> 01:11:51.575
and Raj Gunis become as I have told you right-sided people,

01:11:51.586 --> 01:11:52.773
become very aggressive

01:11:53.326 --> 01:11:56.047
and they become ahamkaris and they can harm.

01:11:57.272 --> 01:12:00.480
But the people who just eat grass can become

01:12:00.547 --> 01:12:03.409
lethargic, absolutely lethargic.

01:12:03.814 --> 01:12:06.262
They will have lethargic heart if not active one,

01:12:06.293 --> 01:12:07.575
they will also get heart attack.

01:12:08.479 --> 01:12:12.114
They will have lethargic intestines by which they will get

01:12:12.156 --> 01:12:14.650
tremendous all the time passing out of the stools,

01:12:14.685 --> 01:12:16.590
they'll never be able to digest any food,

01:12:16.838 --> 01:12:17.906
they'll be very weak people.

01:12:19.026 --> 01:12:22.812
So those people who have a lethargic heart or a lethargic

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:33.617
liver or lethargic intestines should take to proteins.

01:12:34.501 --> 01:12:36.301
I'm not saying meats, but proteins.

01:12:36.801 --> 01:12:39.167
But a vegetarian doesn't take so much proteins.

01:12:39.201 --> 01:12:41.879
It's easier to take meat, there's no harm.

01:12:42.316 --> 01:12:46.775
But those who are active people should take

01:12:46.855 --> 01:12:49.389
more to vegetables. It’s sensible.

01:12:50.848 --> 01:12:54.646
Guru Nanaka ate all the meats, was he a bad man?

01:12:55.148 --> 01:13:00.719
These Maarwadis who are supposed to be absolutely abstaining

01:13:00.769 --> 01:13:03.651
from even from lahasoon (garlic) and pyaj (onion).

01:13:04.244 --> 01:13:07.835
Was He worse than them by any chance?

01:13:08.581 --> 01:13:10.581
What about Buddha, Himself? He ate meat

01:13:10.789 --> 01:13:14.000
because He died of eating raw meat, Himself.

01:13:15.069 --> 01:13:17.166
Only thing you should not eat the meat

01:13:17.514 --> 01:13:19.498
of animals which are bigger than you,

01:13:19.526 --> 01:13:21.842
and not of a cow which is an Indian cow.

01:13:22.703 --> 01:13:23.728
Specially Indian cow.

01:13:24.177 --> 01:13:26.058
Also bigger cows are not good

01:13:26.081 --> 01:13:28.081
because they give you a problem on the teeth.

01:13:32.978 --> 01:13:37.747
But smaller animals, even with Jainism

01:13:37.813 --> 01:13:46.526
they said that you must save the bullocks, the cows,

01:13:47.077 --> 01:13:50.965
and you must save other animals,

01:13:51.386 --> 01:13:53.975
but they never said you must save goats

01:13:53.989 --> 01:13:55.497
and you must save chickens.

01:13:56.122 --> 01:13:59.759
Because Mahavira knew we cannot give Realization to chickens.

01:14:01.029 --> 01:14:04.022
What is the use of saving chickens and mosquitoes

01:14:04.712 --> 01:14:07.045
and also bugs?

01:14:08.834 --> 01:14:10.834
Of course they are doing like that.

01:14:11.214 --> 01:14:13.582
Some Jain people save bugs and

01:14:13.638 --> 01:14:19.234
put it on a human being, and they take the blood of those

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:21.880
human beings and they are paid for it.

01:14:22.854 --> 01:14:24.428
It's absurd but they do it.

01:14:24.644 --> 01:14:26.874
For them bugs are more important than human beings.

01:14:27.871 --> 01:14:31.112
Billions and billions of bugs cannot make a human being.

01:14:33.671 --> 01:14:36.478
All these absurd ideas we have in this country.

01:14:37.295 --> 01:14:41.442
So when I say you are not to be a vegetarian

01:14:41.487 --> 01:14:44.465
or non-vegetarian, you have to see what you need and eat that.

01:14:44.843 --> 01:14:48.643
But all the time your attention is in food itself is wrong.

01:14:51.102 --> 01:14:55.017
So there is no good in you people

01:14:55.890 --> 01:14:59.487
getting into these problems of vegetarianism and non-vegetarianism.

01:14:59.847 --> 01:15:02.581
Of course in the Western countries people should take

01:15:03.025 --> 01:15:08.524
to vegetarian food, not absolutely, but more than what they have,

01:15:08.764 --> 01:15:12.098
while the people who are in India who are vegetarians

01:15:12.138 --> 01:15:14.240
will have to later on take to meat. Otherwise

01:15:14.282 --> 01:15:15.986
they will have lethargic heart.

01:15:16.195 --> 01:15:18.599
I’ll cure them once again they will have problem,

01:15:18.703 --> 01:15:22.350
then they will have to go for a by-pass. Save money there?

01:15:23.244 --> 01:15:27.074
You cannot. You will have lethargic intestines,

01:15:28.244 --> 01:15:33.508
then you will have lethargic liver. You will have all kinds of

01:15:35.518 --> 01:15:38.879
cirrhosis, or maybe on the hand you might get

01:15:38.998 --> 01:15:44.010
all kinds of rashes and things like that, allergies,

01:15:45.288 --> 01:15:50.549
all these problems will come. And then ultimately such people

01:15:50.763 --> 01:15:54.434
look so peaceful because you see, they are like cabbages.

01:15:54.996 --> 01:15:59.519
Yes. If somebody is like a cabbage

01:16:00.443 --> 01:16:02.272
then how do you give him Realization?

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:05.294
You can't give Realization to cabbages can you?

01:16:06.966 --> 01:16:09.829
We have to have here chivalrous people,

01:16:09.976 --> 01:16:11.746
brave people, warriors.

01:16:12.418 --> 01:16:16.357
You have to fight the evil forces, and what can

01:16:16.571 --> 01:16:22.256
these people who are cabbages going to do for it?

01:16:27.501 --> 01:16:31.880
One has to understand yatharth, the reality

01:16:31.933 --> 01:16:36.631
and not put your conception. Because you are born in a Jain family

01:16:37.528 --> 01:16:46.311
and that's why you want everybody to eat grass, is wrong , is wrong.

01:16:46.554 --> 01:16:50.826
The one who has to eat protein must eat protein.

01:16:52.053 --> 01:16:54.510
Now what is the food for Sattvic people?

01:16:57.029 --> 01:17:02.365
That one should eat. You can’t live with it. So what I eat? Channa.

01:17:02.985 --> 01:17:10.017
Can you live with channa? Is protein. Channa, or you can eat meat.

01:17:10.485 --> 01:17:14.637
But not very heavy meats, lean meats and ghee,

01:17:23.372 --> 01:17:27.688
and what I eat the most is honey.

01:17:31.679 --> 01:17:35.757
That's My food. Honey I eat, you know that, honey I drink.

01:17:37.866 --> 01:17:41.591
That's. But you can't live with that can you?

01:17:42.685 --> 01:17:45.412
So you have to eat little carbohydrates. Doesn't matter,

01:17:45.992 --> 01:17:48.810
but you balance yourself in Nabhi Chakra

01:17:51.993 --> 01:17:55.568
But there should be no attention on food at all.

01:17:56.554 --> 01:17:58.140
Actually if you ask Me what I ate

01:17:58.154 --> 01:17:59.798
in the morning, I won't be able to tell you.

01:17:59.834 --> 01:18:03.204
Really I'm very bad at it because I have no attention on it.

01:18:03.706 --> 01:18:06.590
Whatever one gets, eat it, and you don't feel like eating, don't eat.

01:18:07.208 --> 01:18:13.329
What's so important is to enjoy every moment of your life.

01:18:14.563 --> 01:18:17.366
If a person is finicky about food, specially Indians are,

01:18:17.787 --> 01:18:19.591
is very dangerous for Nabhi Chakra.

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:23.744
Because those who are mad after food

01:18:24.158 --> 01:18:25.723
and about Nabhi Chakra

01:18:28.085 --> 01:18:30.462
are extremely hot-tempered, I think and...

01:18:30.938 --> 01:18:33.181
I don’t know what the word in English is but in

01:18:33.194 --> 01:18:34.949
Hindi we call it chichode,

01:18:39.243 --> 01:18:43.710
irritable, irritable, and these chichode

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.649
will make their wives’ lives miserable.

01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:50.702
They will come and tell, “In that house I ate very good curry nuts.”

01:18:51.921 --> 01:18:54.635
So that poor lady is running after the curry nuts.

01:18:54.673 --> 01:18:57.138
We Indians are so much food-minded.

01:18:58.090 --> 01:19:00.633
You can't imagine, they won't believe we are supposed to be

01:19:00.656 --> 01:19:01.446
starving people.

01:19:02.319 --> 01:19:04.319
But we are so food-minded

01:19:04.946 --> 01:19:07.278
that once there was for these Bengalis,

01:19:07.317 --> 01:19:09.913
supposed to be Mukha Bengalis, I must tell you about them.

01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:12.975
They had raw fish, raw fish which they get it

01:19:12.982 --> 01:19:14.155
from the Central India

01:19:14.587 --> 01:19:17.084
and people couldn't get fish so they were starving.

01:19:17.777 --> 01:19:19.732
So Bombay people very graciously sent

01:19:19.931 --> 01:19:22.635
one shipload, because I know that, I was part of it,

01:19:23.494 --> 01:19:28.014
to them as a gracious act that let the Bengalis eat the fish.

01:19:28.145 --> 01:19:31.058
They said, “What? We are not going to eat sea fish,

01:19:31.597 --> 01:19:33.111
we are Bangladeshis.”

01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:36.745
Threw all the fishes in the sea.

01:19:36.784 --> 01:19:39.587
It all become sardana (rotten) and it was thrown into the sea.

01:19:39.947 --> 01:19:42.557
Can you imagine? Nobody will believe in the West,

01:19:42.571 --> 01:19:44.834
this is how we are fasting and

01:19:44.878 --> 01:19:47.634
that is how we are poor people.

01:19:47.734 --> 01:19:52.316
Can poor people afford to throw away one shipload of fish

01:19:52.616 --> 01:19:55.716
in the sea because they want raw fish?

01:19:57.807 --> 01:20:04.035
We are so food-minded that our Nabhis are always like this.

01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:06.930
And our women are to be blamed because

01:20:06.942 --> 01:20:09.933
they know to control their husbands, they are spoilt them.

01:20:15.197 --> 01:20:17.596
The job of a woman is to be a Gruha Lakshmi.

01:20:18.216 --> 01:20:21.429
To have ideals before the family,

01:20:21.974 --> 01:20:24.200
ideals before a husband,

01:20:24.277 --> 01:20:26.277
ideals before the children.

01:20:26.778 --> 01:20:28.522
The house should be ideal,

01:20:28.583 --> 01:20:31.942
should be a warm house where everybody's welcome.

01:20:32.506 --> 01:20:35.814
The wife’s job is to keep her Nabhi all right,

01:20:35.916 --> 01:20:39.213
the Nabhi of the children all right and the Nabhi of the husband

01:20:39.272 --> 01:20:41.597
and Nabhi of all the people who come to her house.

01:20:43.254 --> 01:20:45.612
She has to lead a life of auspiciousness,

01:20:46.244 --> 01:20:52.608
of kindliness, of religious nature. She has to be a soft-natured woman.

01:20:55.596 --> 01:20:59.334
But this is all missing, only thing she is worried with,

01:20:59.483 --> 01:21:04.495
how to please the husbands. Because that's one of the big jobs for her.

01:21:06.386 --> 01:21:08.458
So to keep our Nabhi all right

01:21:08.603 --> 01:21:10.603
we have to understand as Sahaja Yogis

01:21:11.457 --> 01:21:15.327
that we have not to pay so much attention to food.

01:21:17.521 --> 01:21:20.253
That doesn't mean you eat all dirty food.

01:21:21.183 --> 01:21:24.254
But it definitely means that when you eat your food,

01:21:24.394 --> 01:21:26.394
you must see the vibrations of the food.

01:21:27.447 --> 01:21:29.666
You must always give vibrations to the food.

01:21:30.147 --> 01:21:32.147
Eat the food which is vibrated.

01:21:33.126 --> 01:21:35.294
Certain foods, now supposing if

01:21:35.315 --> 01:21:39.578
I have to go and eat in any one of these big five star hotels,

01:21:40.190 --> 01:21:41.422
next moment I vomit,

01:21:41.589 --> 01:21:44.669
I always vomit. If somebody invites Me in a hotel,

01:21:45.478 --> 01:21:47.998
I start thinking, ‘Baba, now what an ordeal.’

01:21:48.810 --> 01:21:50.842
Because it is not cooked with love.

01:21:53.061 --> 01:21:55.608
That's what it says [Marathi],

01:21:57.611 --> 01:22:00.781
“He likes the little berries of Shabari.”

01:22:02.024 --> 01:22:08.074
[ Marathi]

01:22:12.713 --> 01:22:16.753
Was does that mean?  That means the love

01:22:17.387 --> 01:22:21.415
that is expressed in that food

01:22:22.387 --> 01:22:24.387
is what we should care for,

01:22:29.521 --> 01:22:34.315
and not for the lavishness, not for the show of it

01:22:34.456 --> 01:22:37.637
and not at all for your own taste,

01:22:38.051 --> 01:22:40.201
but the taste of food should be

01:22:40.398 --> 01:22:44.634
that it should carry love. Let your tongue feel the love.

01:22:49.541 --> 01:22:51.053
That is the best taste,

01:22:51.393 --> 01:22:54.695
and whatever is cooked with love always tastes very well.

01:22:59.275 --> 01:23:00.697
So when you cook,

01:23:01.562 --> 01:23:05.421
cook with love. When you eat, eat with love.

01:23:06.391 --> 01:23:10.363
With kind words to the person who has cooked with love

01:23:11.882 --> 01:23:18.361
and above all, count your blessings, count your blessings,

01:23:20.503 --> 01:23:25.003
and think of others who may not have had food today.

01:23:26.466 --> 01:23:28.225
This is the Lakshmi Tattwa, is

01:23:28.595 --> 01:23:30.885
where the hand is like this, where it gives

01:23:31.251 --> 01:23:37.006
and there's a hand where it gives protection to people who need money.

01:23:37.481 --> 01:23:39.109
But not in a way we do it,

01:23:40.043 --> 01:23:42.768
the way Americans do or Russians do it. We do the way

01:23:43.424 --> 01:23:44.609
Lakshmi does,

01:23:45.054 --> 01:23:48.107
that this protection does not get out of hand.

01:23:48.257 --> 01:23:50.596
You give it without telling anyone.

01:23:50.617 --> 01:23:52.435
Just because you have to give you give,

01:23:53.144 --> 01:23:54.592
and actually you do that.

01:23:55.073 --> 01:23:58.638
If you have given, as My father said, one rupee to someone,

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.638
run away from that person as soon as possible

01:24:03.230 --> 01:24:05.230
with the speed of one mile, he said.

01:24:05.454 --> 01:24:06.855
But if you have given

01:24:07.488 --> 01:24:11.365
five rupees, run away from him at the speed of 500 miles.

01:24:13.586 --> 01:24:14.750
It's very practical.

01:24:16.426 --> 01:24:17.935
That is how we have to give.

01:24:18.306 --> 01:24:20.018
This is the Lakshmi Tattwa,

01:24:20.561 --> 01:24:23.323
is the Nabhi Chakra about which I have told you.

01:24:24.021 --> 01:24:27.086
It's a very important Chakra,

01:24:27.711 --> 01:24:33.802
because today you are here because in your Chakra,

01:24:33.889 --> 01:24:36.327
Mahalakshmi Tattwa was awakened

01:24:36.845 --> 01:24:42.215
because you wanted to seek God. Because you wanted to come to God.

01:24:42.841 --> 01:24:45.421
You have not come here for money.

01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:50.916
You have not come here for anything else but God.

01:24:51.054 --> 01:24:53.054
Your seeking is in God.

01:24:53.381 --> 01:24:55.662
You want to know the truth about God

01:24:55.918 --> 01:24:57.918
and you want to have God.

01:24:58.299 --> 01:25:00.938
You don't want to put your ideas on to this,

01:25:01.024 --> 01:25:04.741
but you want to see how Mother wants

01:25:04.931 --> 01:25:07.147
us to receive the blessings of God.

01:25:07.988 --> 01:25:14.487
So become that as we seek the love of God, the grace of God.

01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:21.573
The Lakshmi has to be gracious and the Mahalakshmi

01:25:21.817 --> 01:25:27.674
is the One who is the gracious lady, is the graciousness in you.

01:25:28.145 --> 01:25:32.654
The grace that must come evolved into your personality.

01:25:33.138 --> 01:25:36.123
Within that grace he feels the hankering of the Father.

01:25:36.997 --> 01:25:42.129
The Father, the Narayana. He wants to have His blessings,

01:25:42.552 --> 01:25:44.922
and that is how the first, the truth,

01:25:45.242 --> 01:25:47.561
the seeking of the truth rises in you,

01:25:48.226 --> 01:25:51.832
and that is how the honesty of seeking is blessed

01:25:52.721 --> 01:25:54.246
when the Kundalini rises.

01:25:54.359 --> 01:25:57.998
She first gives you - first thing that you get

01:25:58.442 --> 01:26:03.052
is the truth, by enlightening your brain.

01:26:03.551 --> 01:26:05.551
When I will tell you about Sahasrara

01:26:06.284 --> 01:26:13.284
and about Agnya, I will tell you how this brain becomes

01:26:14.872 --> 01:26:17.642
a receptor of the ultimate truth,

01:26:18.777 --> 01:26:22.304
how truth is spread, you start

01:26:22.503 --> 01:26:25.974
receiving the knowledge of absolute truth.

01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:28.765
How this brain when enlightened

01:26:29.258 --> 01:26:37.637
gives you the power to know what is truth and what is not truth,

01:26:38.219 --> 01:26:41.395
and there are no alternatives.

01:26:43.447 --> 01:26:45.101
This I'll tell you later on

01:26:45.319 --> 01:26:48.656
when the Kundalini I'll describe at the brain level.

01:26:49.109 --> 01:26:53.672
But for today I think Nabhi Chakra is very important.

01:26:54.252 --> 01:26:56.906
For all of us, for India specially,

01:26:56.932 --> 01:26:58.783
our Nabhi Chakra is very important,

01:27:00.405 --> 01:27:03.331
that we should know that God Almighty,

01:27:03.943 --> 01:27:07.464
the Narayana, the Vishnu,

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:12.715
is the One who gives the kshema after Yoga.

01:27:12.761 --> 01:27:15.888
He says, “Yoga Kshema Mahatmyam,” He gives the kshema.

01:27:17.074 --> 01:27:19.684
And we are sinning against the God

01:27:20.970 --> 01:27:24.240
when we don't believe that honest and

01:27:24.255 --> 01:27:27.976
righteous and virtuous life will give us the kshema

01:27:28.095 --> 01:27:30.095
as promised by God Almighty.

01:27:30.514 --> 01:27:34.553
You are sinning against our Father, while in the West

01:27:34.804 --> 01:27:37.038
they are sinning against the Mother

01:27:37.534 --> 01:27:39.098
on the left hand side,

01:27:39.214 --> 01:27:43.581
because they have forgotten that immoral life

01:27:43.833 --> 01:27:46.811
is an insult to the Mother Power of God.

01:27:48.184 --> 01:27:50.326
So both things are important,

01:27:50.737 --> 01:27:54.031
whether in the West or East, is important

01:27:54.605 --> 01:27:59.064
that we should not sin against the Father and sin against the Mother.

01:28:00.923 --> 01:28:03.906
I hope I've tried to tell you everything

01:28:04.187 --> 01:28:06.432
in such a way that you do not feel hurt.

01:28:06.786 --> 01:28:09.365
Because all of you come from different, different

01:28:09.965 --> 01:28:12.744
types of lives; different, different conceptions;

01:28:13.173 --> 01:28:17.539
different, different gurus, and you can get confused about it.

01:28:18.033 --> 01:28:20.857
So, in Sahaja Yoga you should

01:28:20.890 --> 01:28:23.282
allow this to work out.

01:28:23.662 --> 01:28:27.457
Allow the light to come in and don't get confused, don't get upset.

01:28:27.957 --> 01:28:30.065
Here you are to seek God

01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:33.281
and not to sit on what you have known so far,

01:28:33.349 --> 01:28:36.546
or which you have heard so far, or whatever you have followed.

01:28:36.753 --> 01:28:40.895
Because that has not given you anything whatsoever.

01:28:41.434 --> 01:28:46.324
Like one of My disciples who's a big officer

01:28:47.602 --> 01:28:49.766
and one day he told Me, “Mother,

01:28:49.842 --> 01:28:51.762
I don't know about Gita,

01:28:51.751 --> 01:28:54.527
I don't know about Ramana, Krishna, anyone.

01:28:55.054 --> 01:28:59.469
I know You, because You are the One who has given me Realization.”

01:29:02.115 --> 01:29:05.599
Of course after knowing Me you will know all of them.

01:29:06.002 --> 01:29:08.002
But it is better you know Me now, because

01:29:08.277 --> 01:29:11.059
Those are no more here. It is I Who is sitting here,

01:29:11.367 --> 01:29:12.946
so better know Me first,

01:29:13.384 --> 01:29:15.384
and then you will know Them better

01:29:15.574 --> 01:29:17.924
than what you have known Them before.

01:29:18.250 --> 01:29:20.803
So let us compromise in this point:

01:29:21.003 --> 01:29:24.274
that try to understand it through Sahaja Yoga.

01:29:24.334 --> 01:29:27.793
Everything can be proved. Whatever I have said is absolute truth,

01:29:28.947 --> 01:29:30.045
nothing but the truth.

01:29:30.852 --> 01:29:35.667
But you allow yourself not to be bound by any

01:29:35.761 --> 01:29:38.239
previous ideas and previous conceptions.

01:29:38.395 --> 01:29:41.636
But let it be open mind to see what I've said,

01:29:41.729 --> 01:29:45.089
it's just a hypothesis, let it become a law.

01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:48.752
When you see it yourself, when it becomes in your heart,

01:29:48.846 --> 01:29:52.040
on the vibrations, when you see and judge what I've said,

01:29:52.145 --> 01:29:59.872
you'll be amazed that Nabhi Chakra which you feel on these fingers,

01:30:00.312 --> 01:30:02.312
even the children can tell you.

01:30:03.496 --> 01:30:06.884
May God bless you all. Thank you very much.

01:30:09.298 --> 01:30:13.613
Tomorrow I'll tell you about other chakra called

01:30:13.743 --> 01:30:17.784
the Chakra of the Devi, Herself .

01:30:23.178 --> 01:30:26.329
If there are any questions, I've told you, you better write it down.

01:30:26.398 --> 01:30:28.040
It's always worked out very well.

01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:32.477
I think now we should go in for meditation and try

01:30:32.940 --> 01:30:34.940
to get your Realization.

01:31:03.691 --> 01:31:06.443
Will you please put your hands towards Me,

01:31:08.514 --> 01:31:11.198
like this, just in humble way.

01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:16.034
Because you have not known so far, and you will know it

01:31:16.746 --> 01:31:21.136
when you will know it: So you put your hands towards Me like this

01:31:22.153 --> 01:31:23.661
and as I've told you these are

01:31:23.702 --> 01:31:26.369
five chakras, sixth and seventh chakra is here is on our hands.

01:31:26.913 --> 01:31:28.414
Five chakras, sixth and seventh.

01:31:31.804 --> 01:31:33.075
I must tell you today I met

01:31:33.157 --> 01:31:35.157
some Kashmiri Muslims, that's a good idea.

01:31:35.863 --> 01:31:39.101
Suddenly they did feel for Me something. I don't know how.

01:31:39.812 --> 01:31:41.812
And they said, “Are You the Mother?”

01:31:41.970 --> 01:31:44.461
I said, “Yes, I am.” They came to Me

01:31:45.296 --> 01:31:48.471
and then said that “You must tell us about Ruh, about Ruh,

01:31:49.353 --> 01:31:51.295
about spiritual life, about Spirit.”

01:31:52.574 --> 01:31:53.534
They came to Me. I said,

01:31:53.556 --> 01:31:55.162
“All right, you put your hands towards Me like this.”

01:31:55.726 --> 01:31:58.902
They put their hands towards Me and they felt the cool breeze.

01:31:59.442 --> 01:32:02.077
And they said, “This is what it is. Mohammed has said

01:32:02.343 --> 01:32:05.705
that your hands will speak. This is it. That's the truth.”

01:32:07.149 --> 01:32:08.758
I said, “Yes,

01:32:11.731 --> 01:32:13.731
when you have your second birth,

01:32:13.952 --> 01:32:16.450
you’ll be rid of all the nonsense of

01:32:16.796 --> 01:32:20.275
these so-called religions which are separating you.

01:32:21.235 --> 01:32:23.421
They were never meant to be separated,

01:32:23.695 --> 01:32:27.192
they were meant to integrate you. But you have done it, doesn't matter.

01:32:27.736 --> 01:32:32.274
Now by God's grace Sahaja Yoga has come, you'll have second birth.

01:32:32.833 --> 01:32:35.220
So all the things that are attached to your birth

01:32:35.696 --> 01:32:41.690
will be finished and you’ll be a new person having a new life in which

01:32:42.045 --> 01:32:46.332
you forget all that is attacking you,

01:32:46.507 --> 01:32:49.649
is attached to you, which is dragging you,

01:32:49.813 --> 01:32:54.608
which is making you think, think, think but not ascend.”

01:32:56.370 --> 01:33:00.673
I'm very happy, these simple Muslims who met Me, they were in a shop

01:33:00.992 --> 01:33:04.670
selling something, and they were so sweet and so beautiful.

01:33:08.028 --> 01:33:10.457
They didn't say that “You are not Mohammed.” Nothing of the kind.

01:33:10.513 --> 01:33:12.365
They said, “This is what Mohammed has said,

01:33:12.634 --> 01:33:15.001
that “At the time of the Resurrection, your hands will speak,”

01:33:16.461 --> 01:33:19.951
and what are these people fighting for?”

01:33:22.640 --> 01:33:26.982
You see. This is what it is.

01:33:28.766 --> 01:33:30.589
May God bless you all!

01:33:35.650 --> 01:33:39.884
Let us have now both the hands towards Me and close your eyes

01:33:40.038 --> 01:33:42.038
just close your eyes.

01:33:42.784 --> 01:33:44.339
[Shri Mataji gives Realization.]
