00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.375
Shri Ganesha Puja, Cabella Ligure,
22 September 2001

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.870
Today we have assembled here

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.210
to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.250
Shri Ganesha who is the Lord of Innocence.

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:33.000
He is the ocean of innocence.

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.040
And though' he is

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:44.370
such a young, little boy,

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.960
he can fight the whole world,

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.120
he can destroy all the negativity.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.370
That's the sign of innocence.

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.330
There have been stories

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.370
that children who have fallen from a very great height

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.370
were completely saved, nothing happened to them.

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:33.210
Their innocence is such a powerful thing

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.210
that it doesn't harm anyone

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.830
who is not to be harmed.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.670
It has all the wisdom of the world,

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.250
all the understanding of the world;

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.870
and anybody who tries to harm the innocence,

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.750
the world, the whole world –

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:13.750
which may not have cared so much for innocence,

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.870
might not have worshiped innocence so much –

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:22.210
but they all stand, stand up against

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.870
anybody who tries to harm the innocence.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.080
You can see in your own lives

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.080
around you,  anybody tries to trouble children –

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.000
all of the them, whatever they are,

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:50.870
whatever they are coming from,

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.080
whatever maybe their nationality,

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.000
they all jump, all jump to control

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.210
and to safeguard that child.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.750
What is it?

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:12.330
What is it within us that makes us so very conscious

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.920
to protect the innocence?

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.830
It's really a shame,

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.750
a great shame for us,

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:33.830
when we find in this world that innocence is under attack.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.330
Anything else can be tolerated.

00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:46.370
Innocent people who have done nothing wrong,

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:53.080
those who have no malice,

00:08:54.870 --> 00:09:01.790
who are living like little children, I should say,

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.080
if they are attacked by anyone –

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.370
not that the whole world reacts to that –

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:23.960
but everyone of them cannot bear

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:31.170
any innocent person or 'innocent being' being harmed.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.370
We don't realise that within us

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:45.080
there is the ocean of love

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.960
and ocean of understanding for children.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.170
Why? Why should it be?

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:00.790
Why should we feel like that, especially for children?

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.370
Especially for innocence?

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:11.870
There are people who are always attacking innocent people,

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:15.330
innocent children, there are.

00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:21.040
But no-one wants to support them.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:29.040
No-one thinks that it's proper to ill-treat children.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:35.210
And those who have done this have to suffer.

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:38.790
They all suffer as a reaction.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.120
What is it within us

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.960
that creates that reaction, that tremendous reaction,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.250
against innocence?

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.920
For example if there is a regular war,

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.920
and if there are people fighting;

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:02.790
in a regular war, they don't have much sympathy.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.040
In the world also, they say “Alright,

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:11.370
they are of that understanding, they are of that kind of a thing”.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.080
The greatest sympathy comes when innocence is being challenged.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:22.370
That's what human beings have.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:29.040
Within themselves they have the power, power of Shri Ganesha,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:35.040
which gives you that feeling,

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:41.710
that capacity, that understanding

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.370
that you have to protect innocent,

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:53.000
innocent children, innocent people.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:58.790
And the whole world can rise against all such people

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.120
who are trying to kill the innocent.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:08.750
There cannot be any doubt.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:15.080
If they cannot oppose such an attack,

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.920
or criticise such a thing,

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.120
then they are not yet human beings, I would say.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:32.370
The highest personality can sacrifice anything

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.830
and can give up anything,

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.790
but they cannot give up the feeling

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:44.670
they have for innocence.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:50.000
It's very remarkable. We don't realise

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:56.750
how much there is this ocean of protection and love

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:59.250
for the innocent.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.170
What attracts the greatest strength is when we see

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:14.250
an innocent person, innocent children, are under attack.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.330
That's the beauty of human beings.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:24.330
Of course there are many human beings who can be cruel,

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:28.790
who are, I would say, call them devils – maybe, maybe.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.330
But when it comes to children,

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.210
and to innocent people,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:42.830
everyone feels his responsibility.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:50.210
It's difficult for normal human beings to be innocent

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:59.330
because they have a kind of an understanding

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.250
that they are something great,

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:11.170
that they understand everything, that they can analyse everything,

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:15.750
and they could be crooks, they could be aggressive,

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:20.330
they could be troublesome, they could be anything –

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.750
and they can give explanation for that, doesn't matter –

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:31.250
but still, on the whole, they can never be respected

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:36.040
and they can never be honoured

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.250
for the thing they are doing.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.870
For us, the Sahaja Yogis,

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:47.040
the Sahaj culture is to respect your innocence.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.040
You might feel a little bit cheated,

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.960
you might feel a little bit dominated,

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.870
you might feel a little bit disgraced,

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.290
but Sahaja Yogi have to be innocent.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.290
Because with them lies the power of Shri Ganesha.

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.250
They should not feel dejected

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:14.830
if they are being used, insulted,

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:19.120
tortured, dominated, it's alright.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.040
They should not try to destroy

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:29.080
the innocence of other people, of anyone.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:34.830
Automatically it will work. You will be amazed

00:15:35.290 --> 00:15:40.210
that when innocence is challenged,

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:47.040
all the goodness of the world comes to the rescue of that.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:55.370
An example of this is the recent war, so-called war, of America.

00:15:56.210 --> 00:16:00.830
Where innocent people – they had done nothing wrong

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:06.250
– have been tortured,have been killed.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:12.290
At that time, all over the world,

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.210
it's a big support for them.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:24.790
Every country, whether it believes in those people or not,

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:30.250
is anxious to look after

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:35.120
those who have done this crime.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.080
They may not be belonging to the same religion,

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.170
they may not be belonging to the same country,

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.330
they may not be belonging to the same crimes,

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:53.080
but at this moment, who does not take the side of the innocence

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:59.210
will be singled out and will be destroyed – no doubt about it.

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:03.870
Once and for all they will learn a lesson

00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.710
that 'you cannot attack innocent people'.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:11.670
I have told you, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:16.790
we should not ever be annoyed with out children.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.750
We should not, in no way punish them.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:28.330
Our main achievement

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.120
should be that loving attention for children.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:39.170
All over the world, whether he belongs

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:43.000
to your family or to some other family,

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.750
or has some sort of

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:54.710
detached attention with you,

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:00.290
still because he's a child, he's innocent,

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:07.250
the innocence within itself, your own innocence,

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.370
will try to protect.

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:18.370
It's very surprising how people take to sacrificing their lives

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:26.250
when it comes to the attack of innocence.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:30.080
Children should never be attacked.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.000
They have their own power to protect, no doubt.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.790
But you shouldn't waste your energy on something

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:45.080
that is extremely inauspicious,

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:52.170
extremely cruel and extremely ugly.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.870
If you cannot love children, you cannot love anything.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:05.330
I have not come across anyone so far who says

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:08.080
that they don't love children – luckily!

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:14.370
But maybe some might say “We love flowers”. Why?

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.080
Why do you love flowers? Because they are innocent.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:24.000
Because that beauty of innocence is within them.

00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:26.250
You love nature – why?

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:28.960
Because it is innocent.

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:35.170
But the greatest innocence is seen among human beings

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:39.250
who are Sahaja Yogis.

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:47.330
It is easy to be cunning, very easy to be cunning.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.920
It's very easy to be clever.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.750
But to be wise, one should understand

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:00.960
the beauty of being innocent.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.250
Possibly one may say “Mother,

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:07.290
one can get exploited if you are innocent”.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:12.040
No-one can exploit an innocent person.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.830
They may believe that they have done this,

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.750
they have been very aggressive and all that, but they cannot.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:23.330
It is like a rock.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:30.170
It is like a rock that is not prevailed by

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:35.120
any ocean of anger

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:41.250
or any kind of revenge.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:48.080
It's the rock that is being looked after

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.210
and nourished by Shri Ganesha.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.210
I've told you before also,

00:20:56.710 --> 00:21:01.080
that the innocence within us never gets destroyed.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.170
Very surprising. You may be a sinner,

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:10.370
you may be a very cruel person, you might be anything:

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:15.290
but it does not get,

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.120
it cannot get it.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.870
After innocence.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:32.120
It is a very, very secret thing that is put in us by the Divine.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:39.210
We play with our innocence very much.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:44.920
We think that by behaving any way we like,

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:50.290
“It's alright, after all it's my own desire, my wish”.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:57.000
And we'll go on, we go on all the time

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:02.080
reducing our power, or we can say the hiding,

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:07.040
or covering our power of innocence.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.790
And we think that we have done a great job,

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:18.960
that we have befooled all the people by our tricky nature.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:25.040
This tricky nature cannot give you any satisfaction.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.210
It is not self-sufficient.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:34.670
When you try to trick someone, this trick works on you,

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:44.040
it is repelled on you, and destroys your faith in innocence –

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.290
which is the greatest faith,

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:51.080
the greatest help

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:55.750
or [UNCLEAR} the greatest power on this earth.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.870
Those people who do not respect their innocence

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:04.330
because they think it makes you weak,

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:09.750
have not seen the power of innocence –

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:13.000
how it works, how it acts.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:19.290
From all over the world, it reacts.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:28.170
But, so far, I think the human beings are not conscious of the power

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.000
power of innocence.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.920
But it is the highest thing to be innocent.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:39.170
And it acts

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:46.290
as if the whole understanding,

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:54.750
whole working-out of the be-ing

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:59.000
is so beautifully achieved.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.210
Now you see in this world

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:09.920
what says ,what people remember, what is respected.

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:17.000
It is respected the high ideals.

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:26.000
But if you see to the subtle side of these high ideals of people

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:33.920
have led a very, very beautiful life of very good character,

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.790
of very good nature'

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:43.170
– all these people may have been harmed

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.870
may have been killed –

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:50.000
but because of their innocence they shine,

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.920
and shine through ages.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:59.670
You can see the life of all great men like that;

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:05.830
they are all very simple,

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:13.040
they are not deliberating anything –

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:21.080
spontaneous they are in their behaviour, spontaneously they live.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:28.330
Nations after nations can be destroyed,

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:32.750
but the power of innocence cannot be destroyed.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.750
Have faith in that.

00:25:35.290 --> 00:25:38.120
You have to have complete faith in yourself,

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:42.290
and that 'yourself' is nothing but innocence.

00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:47.750
You may say that 'innocent people get cheated'.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.960
Nobody can cheat innocence,

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:56.040
because that is something of very eternal value.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.870
They might cheat you in money, might cheat you in something,

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:04.830
but the thing that is the most eternal is your innocence.

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:08.790
And you will be the most successful person

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.960
in life when you are absolutely innocent

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.960
and your are looking after your innocence.

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:22.790
As I have told you, that innocence never gets destroyed.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.750
It can be covered by your ill thoughts,

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.870
by ill-doing, it might be covered for the time being.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.120
But if you can take out the clouds

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:39.080
away from the sky of innocence,

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:42.830
the whole thing becomes so obvious

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.960
that you have won the whole world.

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:50.790
We can take the case of Christ. He was crucified,

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:54.710
he was insulted, he was tortured.

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.870
Those who did this, where are they?

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.960
Who knows them? Nobody even knows the name.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.790
Nobody is even bothered about them.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:10.000
A single one person was so much used

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:12.120
and was so much tortured.

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:17.790
But despite that, what has happened?

00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:21.870
He has got the respect from the whole world.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.210
The whole world respects.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:31.710
Nobody says that ‘Look at that, how he was crucified,

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.330
what has he done …' Nothing of the kind.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:40.960
They just respect. And what do they respect? The essence,

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:46.870
the essence of complete innocence.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:56.750
They say in Sahaja Yoga that he was the incarnation of innocence.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:03.790
He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha – which can be verified.

00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:12.710
So, when we think that in our own ventures we can do what we like,

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.870
and we don't want to even remember that, we don't want to even

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:20.080
consider that it's a wrong thing to do,

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:26.120
we do not know what is ahead of us.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:28.750
What happened to Hitler also?

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:32.870
He thought he can destroy the whole world,

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:36.670
he can manage to kill so many people

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:41.750
and still he will remain a very great personality.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.250
They are stupid not to understand

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:47.250
who are the people really respected.

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.290
Through ages, through history, no-one like Hitler.

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.710
He didn't understand if you wanted to have

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:59.330
really the power over the world,

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:03.790
and he wanted to have the reputation of a great man,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.370
he should have followed the great people.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.920
And the great people are those who are innocent.

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:16.960
Their main power is innocence; take any one of them.

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:23.170
I don't know how to say that this power acts,

00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:25.920
because it acts in so many ways.

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:32.290
You can pass through historical events, so many of them,

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:37.750
and what will you find? A person who is so innocent,

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:42.330
simple and wise

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.750
is remembered all your life.

00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:54.330
I was a child, very small, when I was in school

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.080
I used to go to the library

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:04.120
and read about the lives of great men

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:10.210
who have created some great things for us.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:12.750
So many of them.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:15.790
And I was so impressed

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:23.120
how some of them were so simple, so child-like.

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:28.040
For example Abraham Lincoln

00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:33.250
for whom I have tremendous, tremendous respect,

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.210
was a man tortured by his wife also.

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:40.830
She said “You don't know, you are very clumsy,

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:46.670
you don't know how to dress up, you don't know how to behave”.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:56.370
And she actually was very harsh on him, all the time torturing him.

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:00.960
Ultimately he was also killed.

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:06.370
So one can say, “You see, what's the use of being Abraham Lincoln?

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:14.250
Because he was killed, he was not successful.”

00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:18.960
Until today, all over the world,

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:22.920
people know who was Abraham Lincoln.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:27.000
They don't know his wife – maybe.

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:36.670
But they knew who was Abraham Lincoln, everybody.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:42.330
Clumsy man, according to her,

00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:47.830
and all sorts of degradation for him.

00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:54.670
But nobody respects her, nobody thinks anything about her.

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:59.040
Who is respected today is Abraham Lincoln.

00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:06.790
Why? 'Actually he was murdered, he was killed,

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:11.040
that shows that he had no strength to survive' –

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:15.370
but he survived through ages!

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:22.290
So many years have passed, still he's surviving.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.870
Take the case of all the great people

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:30.670
who have been innocent;

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.710
and that's why they had ideals.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:37.960
To them their ideals were more important than anything else,

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:42.000
even their lives. Everything was nothing.

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:46.170
Now the sense of ideals and idealism

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:48.790
comes only from your innocence.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:54.000
That's the one which teaches you what is your ideal;

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.170
how you should exist;

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.370
what kind of a life you should lead.

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:08.960
It is not important that you have big authorities,

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:15.920
or you have a very big positions as ministers and all that.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:19.170
There have been so many who came and died.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:23.750
They had so many people with ambitions

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:29.710
and so many people who were oppressive, but where are they?

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:33.750
Nobody's bothered about them, nobody wants to look at them.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.830
If their photograph appears people close their eyes

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.830
'No, no, we don't want to see this man'.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.750
But if there's a little boy, innocent child,

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.290
who is talking in a very innocent manner,

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.790
the whole world admires that child.

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:58.210
And these great men are, really,

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:02.210
they are the symbols of that innocence.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:08.750
Their main quality was innocence, from where the wisdom has come.

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:13.170
Ganesha's main quality is his wisdom.

00:34:15.370 --> 00:34:19.210
He knew what was success, through his,

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:24.120
I should say, innocent qualities.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.670
Sometimes the innocent people are not even aware of their

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.080
quality of innocence.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:38.370
It's very surprising how the quality of innocence

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:42.870
shines through human beings who may be very ordinary,

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:45.920
who may be very

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:58.370
who may be very simple, who may not look so intelligent and sharp,

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:02.370
who may not become good diplomats, what ever it is –

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:09.330
they are innocent! That's were ends all the glory of human beings.

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:11.960
To be innocent –

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:15.000
What's the matter?

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:24.870
– so to be innocent, what do you do?

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:30.920
People will say, “Mother, what do we do to be innocent?”

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:39.920
Firstly, you can see for yourself

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.870
how your mind works.

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:50.790
What does it do? How it reacts.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.750
This is what one has to watch,

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.330
which I call as 'introspection'.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:05.830
What sort of plans your mind takes to?

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:12.330
What does it think is the best?

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:16.040
In that thinking, thought process,

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:24.670
what is the most important way to look at yourself?

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:31.790
The first and the foremost is that

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:35.710
you should know how you react to someone.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:43.750
Is it an innocent reaction? Or it is a vindictive reaction.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.370
It is very easy to see yourself,

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.040
because now you are all Sahaja Yogi.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.250
You can see for yourself how is your reaction

00:36:57.370 --> 00:37:04.080
to any aggression on you, or any kind of a

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:10.290
trouble coming on you. How do you react to that?

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:13.830
What is your behaviour?

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:20.290
If you are a very powerful person, then your behaviour is –

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:25.830
for that you are not bothered. You see for yourself its

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:28.670
just a stupid thing people are doing to you.

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.120
Absolutely stupid.

00:37:31.830 --> 00:37:33.920
And when they are doing stupid things,

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.960
why should we bother about them?

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:40.080
Why should we waste our energy about them?

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:48.000
It comes to a point where their stupidity is found out,

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:54.670
in such a manner that all their lives and afterwards

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.710
they are treated with contempt.

00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:00.370
People don't even want to take their names,

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:04.000
they don't want to have their photographs,

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.120
they don't want to have anything to do with them.

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:12.960
At this time, at such a juncture,

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:18.080
what happens is the people who are crooks,

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:25.870
who are not innocent, who are against innocence,

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.290
they start following them because it suits them better.

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:36.290
It suits them to be aggressive, to be cunning

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:40.040
and that's how a new group is formed –

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:43.290
which we can call 'a satanic group'.

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:48.370
And this satanic group also cannot do anything,

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.710
anything whatsoever, to an innocent personality.

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:55.370
There is a Sanskrit sloka like that –

00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:00.790
Nainam chidanti sashtrani – for the Spirit,

00:39:01.330 --> 00:39:04.710
'It cannot be killed by any weapon'.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:10.830
Nainam dahanti pavaka – 'No fire can burn it'.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:15.960
Sayanam cleydayantaposh naso sathe maratha –

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:21.870
Marutha is the air, or we can call it wind,

00:39:22.290 --> 00:39:24.710
'Wind cannot also suck it',

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:29.960
it is above all the nature, which is trying to destroy.

00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:35.830
But you will be amazed that nature understands.

00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:38.250
I told you, nature is innocent.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.960
It understands and it acts

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:49.750
at the right moment, against the person who is aggressive,

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:57.330
who is trying to malign

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.710
or trouble an innocent person.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:09.000
In this way we should know that we have to worship our innocence.

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:12.040
I know sometimes one feels

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:14.710
that you are dominated because of that.

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:21.250
Sometimes one feels sad that  'Why you are put to this kind

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:23.790
of a treatment by others'.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.750
All kinds of things come to your mind.

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:29.920
But if you worship your innocence,

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:34.210
then you will be always a happy person,

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.710
always a kind person, always be humble person.

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:43.250
So, one has to be careful.

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:45.370
You are your own destroyer!

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.210
You are the one who kills, you see

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:50.370
What do you say to it?

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:53.370
Hitler destroyed himself; who has destroyed him?

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:57.120
I mean in any way, everybody has to die so he would have been dead.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:01.120
But who has destroyed it forever is himself.

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:04.710
So, you kill yourself –

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:08.790
through this you can save yourself

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:13.790
and become very glorified if you are innocent.

00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.000
Have faith in the power of innocence.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.790
What is important is, how you show in your own life

00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:29.370
the power of innocence, how you behave towards each other,

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:33.370
and that is what is what, is what I call 'the love'.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.830
You cannot be compassionate unless and until

00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:40.960
you have this attitude towards yourself.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.960
You cannot be kind. Temporarily you might feel this,

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:49.120
but a permanently compassionate temperament comes

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:54.080
only through the permanent flowing of innocence

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:55.830
through your character.

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:59.330
It's such a transparent thing in a human being

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:05.330
and that it sustains, it overpowers all other things,

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:12.790
leave alone the time – thousands of years people will not forget

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:18.250
you the Sahaja Yogi, if you show your valour

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:23.670
and your strength of your innocence.

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:28.370
I'm sorry for today's programme being so late,

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:32.040
but you know I was ready to come

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:39.210
but the marriages are becoming the main function now.

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.830
Because it came so late,

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:46.790
that till the last minute we were deciding about marriages.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:51.750
But I am telling you this is the last time. Next time we'll stop it.

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:57.960
You must send your applications

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:04.670
at least eight days before, and for Ganapatipule it is two weeks.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:11.870
Otherwise – there are only twenty-four hours in a day,

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.250
and you cannot increase those!

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:19.830
Now there is one humble request I have to make,

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:24.710
that if you want to settle your marriage,

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:31.370
then please do it in a way that I can have time to see.

00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:35.000
Otherwise I'll leave it to others to decide.

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:37.330
If you like, it can be done.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:41.830
So a simple thing is this to understand,

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.670
that marriage is a very important thing.

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:48.330
You can create innocent children if you are married.

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:53.370
But if you behave in this manner, little, little responsible –

00:43:55.170 --> 00:44:00.370
so I have to request you to understand the value of time.

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:06.670
Because from next time I can assure you we cannot have marriages

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:11.170
if you send your applications so late.

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:14.250
It should be within one week's time,

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:18.040
I hope you'll understand that.

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:19.670
Thank you very much.
