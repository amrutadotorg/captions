00:00.000 --> 00:00.375
Shri Ganesha Puja, Cabella Ligure,
22 September 2001

05:00.210 --> 05:03.870
Today we have assembled here

05:06.080 --> 05:09.210
to worship Shri Ganesha.

05:13.790 --> 05:19.250
Shri Ganesha who is the Lord of Innocence.

05:26.170 --> 05:33.000
He is the ocean of innocence.

05:34.870 --> 05:37.040
And though' he is

05:38.290 --> 05:44.370
such a young, little boy,

05:47.370 --> 05:51.960
he can fight the whole world,

05:55.120 --> 06:01.120
he can destroy all the negativity.

06:03.120 --> 06:07.370
That's the sign of innocence.

06:12.670 --> 06:14.330
There have been stories

06:15.120 --> 06:18.370
that children who have fallen from a very great height

06:20.170 --> 06:23.370
were completely saved, nothing happened to them.

06:26.790 --> 06:33.210
Their innocence is such a powerful thing

06:36.080 --> 06:39.210
that it doesn't harm anyone

06:41.040 --> 06:43.830
who is not to be harmed.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.670
It has all the wisdom of the world,

06:50.870 --> 06:53.250
all the understanding of the world;

06:54.960 --> 07:01.870
and anybody who tries to harm the innocence,

07:03.080 --> 07:06.750
the world, the whole world –

07:07.870 --> 07:13.750
which may not have cared so much for innocence,

07:14.210 --> 07:16.870
might not have worshiped innocence so much –

07:17.370 --> 07:22.210
but they all stand, stand up against

07:22.920 --> 07:28.870
anybody who tries to harm the innocence.

07:32.750 --> 07:37.080
You can see in your own lives

07:38.040 --> 07:43.080
around you,  anybody tries to trouble children –

07:44.330 --> 07:48.000
all of the them, whatever they are,

07:48.830 --> 07:50.870
whatever they are coming from,

07:51.370 --> 07:54.080
whatever maybe their nationality,

07:54.750 --> 07:59.000
they all jump, all jump to control

08:00.040 --> 08:02.210
and to safeguard that child.

08:04.210 --> 08:05.750
What is it?

08:07.120 --> 08:12.330
What is it within us that makes us so very conscious

08:14.250 --> 08:17.920
to protect the innocence?

08:20.290 --> 08:24.830
It's really a shame,

08:25.370 --> 08:27.750
a great shame for us,

08:28.670 --> 08:33.830
when we find in this world that innocence is under attack.

08:36.040 --> 08:41.330
Anything else can be tolerated.

08:42.210 --> 08:46.370
Innocent people who have done nothing wrong,

08:47.370 --> 08:53.080
those who have no malice,

08:54.870 --> 09:01.790
who are living like little children, I should say,

09:03.710 --> 09:06.080
if they are attacked by anyone –

09:10.040 --> 09:14.370
not that the whole world reacts to that –

09:17.080 --> 09:23.960
but everyone of them cannot bear

09:25.790 --> 09:31.170
any innocent person or 'innocent being' being harmed.

09:33.670 --> 09:37.370
We don't realise that within us

09:40.370 --> 09:45.080
there is the ocean of love

09:46.920 --> 09:51.960
and ocean of understanding for children.

09:53.170 --> 09:55.170
Why? Why should it be?

09:56.330 --> 10:00.790
Why should we feel like that, especially for children?

10:03.170 --> 10:05.370
Especially for innocence?

10:06.330 --> 10:11.870
There are people who are always attacking innocent people,

10:13.080 --> 10:15.330
innocent children, there are.

10:16.290 --> 10:21.040
But no-one wants to support them.

10:23.120 --> 10:29.040
No-one thinks that it's proper to ill-treat children.

10:30.830 --> 10:35.210
And those who have done this have to suffer.

10:35.710 --> 10:38.790
They all suffer as a reaction.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.120
What is it within us

10:42.370 --> 10:45.960
that creates that reaction, that tremendous reaction,

10:47.000 --> 10:50.250
against innocence?

10:51.080 --> 10:53.920
For example if there is a regular war,

10:54.870 --> 10:56.920
and if there are people fighting;

10:57.710 --> 11:02.790
in a regular war, they don't have much sympathy.

11:04.370 --> 11:07.040
In the world also, they say “Alright,

11:07.710 --> 11:11.370
they are of that understanding, they are of that kind of a thing”.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.080
The greatest sympathy comes when innocence is being challenged.

11:20.210 --> 11:22.370
That's what human beings have.

11:23.120 --> 11:29.040
Within themselves they have the power, power of Shri Ganesha,

11:30.960 --> 11:35.040
which gives you that feeling,

11:36.750 --> 11:41.710
that capacity, that understanding

11:43.000 --> 11:47.370
that you have to protect innocent,

11:48.370 --> 11:53.000
innocent children, innocent people.

11:53.830 --> 11:58.790
And the whole world can rise against all such people

11:59.040 --> 12:02.120
who are trying to kill the innocent.

12:03.330 --> 12:08.750
There cannot be any doubt.

12:09.870 --> 12:15.080
If they cannot oppose such an attack,

12:15.750 --> 12:17.920
or criticise such a thing,

12:18.330 --> 12:22.120
then they are not yet human beings, I would say.

12:24.870 --> 12:32.370
The highest personality can sacrifice anything

12:34.830 --> 12:36.830
and can give up anything,

12:38.040 --> 12:41.790
but they cannot give up the feeling

12:42.370 --> 12:44.670
they have for innocence.

12:46.210 --> 12:50.000
It's very remarkable. We don't realise

12:50.750 --> 12:56.750
how much there is this ocean of protection and love

12:57.290 --> 12:59.250
for the innocent.

13:03.120 --> 13:07.170
What attracts the greatest strength is when we see

13:08.120 --> 13:14.250
an innocent person, innocent children, are under attack.

13:16.370 --> 13:19.330
That's the beauty of human beings.

13:20.210 --> 13:24.330
Of course there are many human beings who can be cruel,

13:24.870 --> 13:28.790
who are, I would say, call them devils – maybe, maybe.

13:29.330 --> 13:32.330
But when it comes to children,

13:34.080 --> 13:36.210
and to innocent people,

13:37.330 --> 13:42.830
everyone feels his responsibility.

13:46.330 --> 13:50.210
It's difficult for normal human beings to be innocent

13:51.670 --> 13:59.330
because they have a kind of an understanding

14:01.960 --> 14:05.250
that they are something great,

14:06.170 --> 14:11.170
that they understand everything, that they can analyse everything,

14:11.920 --> 14:15.750
and they could be crooks, they could be aggressive,

14:16.120 --> 14:20.330
they could be troublesome, they could be anything –

14:21.750 --> 14:24.750
and they can give explanation for that, doesn't matter –

14:25.170 --> 14:31.250
but still, on the whole, they can never be respected

14:32.170 --> 14:36.040
and they can never be honoured

14:36.790 --> 14:38.250
for the thing they are doing.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.870
For us, the Sahaja Yogis,

14:42.210 --> 14:47.040
the Sahaj culture is to respect your innocence.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.040
You might feel a little bit cheated,

14:50.330 --> 14:52.960
you might feel a little bit dominated,

14:54.250 --> 14:56.870
you might feel a little bit disgraced,

14:57.120 --> 15:01.290
but Sahaja Yogi have to be innocent.

15:02.120 --> 15:05.290
Because with them lies the power of Shri Ganesha.

15:06.960 --> 15:09.250
They should not feel dejected

15:10.250 --> 15:14.830
if they are being used, insulted,

15:15.210 --> 15:19.120
tortured, dominated, it's alright.

15:21.250 --> 15:24.040
They should not try to destroy

15:24.290 --> 15:29.080
the innocence of other people, of anyone.

15:30.710 --> 15:34.830
Automatically it will work. You will be amazed

15:35.290 --> 15:40.210
that when innocence is challenged,

15:41.920 --> 15:47.040
all the goodness of the world comes to the rescue of that.

15:48.750 --> 15:55.370
An example of this is the recent war, so-called war, of America.

15:56.210 --> 16:00.830
Where innocent people – they had done nothing wrong

16:01.670 --> 16:06.250
– have been tortured,have been killed.

16:07.250 --> 16:12.290
At that time, all over the world,

16:13.750 --> 16:17.210
it's a big support for them.

16:18.710 --> 16:24.790
Every country, whether it believes in those people or not,

16:25.710 --> 16:30.250
is anxious to look after

16:31.290 --> 16:35.120
those who have done this crime.

16:36.040 --> 16:39.080
They may not be belonging to the same religion,

16:39.370 --> 16:42.170
they may not be belonging to the same country,

16:42.920 --> 16:46.330
they may not be belonging to the same crimes,

16:47.120 --> 16:53.080
but at this moment, who does not take the side of the innocence

16:53.920 --> 16:59.210
will be singled out and will be destroyed – no doubt about it.

17:00.710 --> 17:03.870
Once and for all they will learn a lesson

17:04.080 --> 17:07.710
that 'you cannot attack innocent people'.

17:09.290 --> 17:11.670
I have told you, in Sahaja Yoga,

17:12.080 --> 17:16.790
we should not ever be annoyed with out children.

17:18.120 --> 17:21.750
We should not, in no way punish them.

17:23.670 --> 17:28.330
Our main achievement

17:29.120 --> 17:34.120
should be that loving attention for children.

17:34.870 --> 17:39.170
All over the world, whether he belongs

17:39.370 --> 17:43.000
to your family or to some other family,

17:43.290 --> 17:45.750
or has some sort of

17:50.370 --> 17:54.710
detached attention with you,

17:55.750 --> 18:00.290
still because he's a child, he's innocent,

18:01.330 --> 18:07.250
the innocence within itself, your own innocence,

18:07.830 --> 18:09.370
will try to protect.

18:11.710 --> 18:18.370
It's very surprising how people take to sacrificing their lives

18:19.170 --> 18:26.250
when it comes to the attack of innocence.

18:27.330 --> 18:30.080
Children should never be attacked.

18:32.040 --> 18:35.000
They have their own power to protect, no doubt.

18:35.870 --> 18:39.790
But you shouldn't waste your energy on something

18:39.960 --> 18:45.080
that is extremely inauspicious,

18:45.920 --> 18:52.170
extremely cruel and extremely ugly.

18:55.120 --> 18:59.870
If you cannot love children, you cannot love anything.

19:00.920 --> 19:05.330
I have not come across anyone so far who says

19:05.830 --> 19:08.080
that they don't love children – luckily!

19:08.920 --> 19:14.370
But maybe some might say “We love flowers”. Why?

19:15.040 --> 19:19.080
Why do you love flowers? Because they are innocent.

19:20.250 --> 19:24.000
Because that beauty of innocence is within them.

19:24.370 --> 19:26.250
You love nature – why?

19:26.710 --> 19:28.960
Because it is innocent.

19:29.370 --> 19:35.170
But the greatest innocence is seen among human beings

19:35.790 --> 19:39.250
who are Sahaja Yogis.

19:43.870 --> 19:47.330
It is easy to be cunning, very easy to be cunning.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.920
It's very easy to be clever.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.750
But to be wise, one should understand

19:58.290 --> 20:00.960
the beauty of being innocent.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.250
Possibly one may say “Mother,

20:04.370 --> 20:07.290
one can get exploited if you are innocent”.

20:08.290 --> 20:12.040
No-one can exploit an innocent person.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.830
They may believe that they have done this,

20:14.960 --> 20:18.750
they have been very aggressive and all that, but they cannot.

20:20.120 --> 20:23.330
It is like a rock.

20:24.710 --> 20:30.170
It is like a rock that is not prevailed by

20:30.370 --> 20:35.120
any ocean of anger

20:36.080 --> 20:41.250
or any kind of revenge.

20:43.210 --> 20:48.080
It's the rock that is being looked after

20:48.920 --> 20:52.210
and nourished by Shri Ganesha.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.210
I've told you before also,

20:56.710 --> 21:01.080
that the innocence within us never gets destroyed.

21:01.960 --> 21:05.170
Very surprising. You may be a sinner,

21:06.790 --> 21:10.370
you may be a very cruel person, you might be anything:

21:11.710 --> 21:15.290
but it does not get,

21:16.040 --> 21:18.120
it cannot get it.

21:21.920 --> 21:24.870
After innocence.

21:26.040 --> 21:32.120
It is a very, very secret thing that is put in us by the Divine.

21:34.670 --> 21:39.210
We play with our innocence very much.

21:40.210 --> 21:44.920
We think that by behaving any way we like,

21:45.750 --> 21:50.290
“It's alright, after all it's my own desire, my wish”.

21:51.330 --> 21:57.000
And we'll go on, we go on all the time

21:58.080 --> 22:02.080
reducing our power, or we can say the hiding,

22:02.710 --> 22:07.040
or covering our power of innocence.

22:07.920 --> 22:11.790
And we think that we have done a great job,

22:12.710 --> 22:18.960
that we have befooled all the people by our tricky nature.

22:20.790 --> 22:25.040
This tricky nature cannot give you any satisfaction.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.210
It is not self-sufficient.

22:29.170 --> 22:34.670
When you try to trick someone, this trick works on you,

22:36.210 --> 22:44.040
it is repelled on you, and destroys your faith in innocence –

22:45.000 --> 22:47.290
which is the greatest faith,

22:48.290 --> 22:51.080
the greatest help

22:51.370 --> 22:55.750
or [UNCLEAR} the greatest power on this earth.

22:56.120 --> 23:00.870
Those people who do not respect their innocence

23:01.370 --> 23:04.330
because they think it makes you weak,

23:06.710 --> 23:09.750
have not seen the power of innocence –

23:10.330 --> 23:13.000
how it works, how it acts.

23:13.670 --> 23:19.290
From all over the world, it reacts.

23:21.170 --> 23:28.170
But, so far, I think the human beings are not conscious of the power

23:28.960 --> 23:31.000
power of innocence.

23:31.330 --> 23:34.920
But it is the highest thing to be innocent.

23:36.250 --> 23:39.170
And it acts

23:41.370 --> 23:46.290
as if the whole understanding,

23:48.960 --> 23:54.750
whole working-out of the be-ing

23:56.170 --> 23:59.000
is so beautifully achieved.

23:59.920 --> 24:02.210
Now you see in this world

24:03.920 --> 24:09.920
what says ,what people remember, what is respected.

24:12.170 --> 24:17.000
It is respected the high ideals.

24:18.370 --> 24:26.000
But if you see to the subtle side of these high ideals of people

24:26.290 --> 24:33.920
have led a very, very beautiful life of very good character,

24:34.370 --> 24:36.790
of very good nature'

24:37.750 --> 24:43.170
– all these people may have been harmed

24:43.790 --> 24:45.870
may have been killed –

24:46.120 --> 24:50.000
but because of their innocence they shine,

24:50.250 --> 24:52.920
and shine through ages.

24:54.120 --> 24:59.670
You can see the life of all great men like that;

25:00.210 --> 25:05.830
they are all very simple,

25:07.710 --> 25:13.040
they are not deliberating anything –

25:14.170 --> 25:21.080
spontaneous they are in their behaviour, spontaneously they live.

25:23.210 --> 25:28.330
Nations after nations can be destroyed,

25:28.960 --> 25:32.750
but the power of innocence cannot be destroyed.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.750
Have faith in that.

25:35.290 --> 25:38.120
You have to have complete faith in yourself,

25:38.790 --> 25:42.290
and that 'yourself' is nothing but innocence.

25:43.790 --> 25:47.750
You may say that 'innocent people get cheated'.

25:49.830 --> 25:51.960
Nobody can cheat innocence,

25:52.170 --> 25:56.040
because that is something of very eternal value.

25:56.920 --> 25:59.870
They might cheat you in money, might cheat you in something,

26:00.210 --> 26:04.830
but the thing that is the most eternal is your innocence.

26:05.790 --> 26:08.790
And you will be the most successful person

26:10.040 --> 26:14.960
in life when you are absolutely innocent

26:15.210 --> 26:17.960
and your are looking after your innocence.

26:18.750 --> 26:22.790
As I have told you, that innocence never gets destroyed.

26:23.040 --> 26:26.750
It can be covered by your ill thoughts,

26:26.960 --> 26:30.870
by ill-doing, it might be covered for the time being.

26:31.120 --> 26:34.120
But if you can take out the clouds

26:34.790 --> 26:39.080
away from the sky of innocence,

26:39.370 --> 26:42.830
the whole thing becomes so obvious

26:43.040 --> 26:45.960
that you have won the whole world.

26:46.830 --> 26:50.790
We can take the case of Christ. He was crucified,

26:51.170 --> 26:54.710
he was insulted, he was tortured.

26:55.330 --> 26:57.870
Those who did this, where are they?

26:59.040 --> 27:02.960
Who knows them? Nobody even knows the name.

27:03.920 --> 27:05.790
Nobody is even bothered about them.

27:06.120 --> 27:10.000
A single one person was so much used

27:10.290 --> 27:12.120
and was so much tortured.

27:12.370 --> 27:17.790
But despite that, what has happened?

27:18.330 --> 27:21.870
He has got the respect from the whole world.

27:22.330 --> 27:25.210
The whole world respects.

27:27.290 --> 27:31.710
Nobody says that ‘Look at that, how he was crucified,

27:32.080 --> 27:34.330
what has he done …' Nothing of the kind.

27:35.920 --> 27:40.960
They just respect. And what do they respect? The essence,

27:41.210 --> 27:46.870
the essence of complete innocence.

27:48.790 --> 27:56.750
They say in Sahaja Yoga that he was the incarnation of innocence.

27:57.920 --> 28:03.790
He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha – which can be verified.

28:05.370 --> 28:12.710
So, when we think that in our own ventures we can do what we like,

28:13.790 --> 28:16.870
and we don't want to even remember that, we don't want to even

28:17.250 --> 28:20.080
consider that it's a wrong thing to do,

28:21.790 --> 28:26.120
we do not know what is ahead of us.

28:26.870 --> 28:28.750
What happened to Hitler also?

28:29.750 --> 28:32.870
He thought he can destroy the whole world,

28:33.080 --> 28:36.670
he can manage to kill so many people

28:36.870 --> 28:41.750
and still he will remain a very great personality.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.250
They are stupid not to understand

28:44.870 --> 28:47.250
who are the people really respected.

28:48.080 --> 28:53.290
Through ages, through history, no-one like Hitler.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.710
He didn't understand if you wanted to have

28:56.920 --> 28:59.330
really the power over the world,

28:59.870 --> 29:03.790
and he wanted to have the reputation of a great man,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.370
he should have followed the great people.

29:07.120 --> 29:10.920
And the great people are those who are innocent.

29:12.040 --> 29:16.960
Their main power is innocence; take any one of them.

29:18.370 --> 29:23.170
I don't know how to say that this power acts,

29:23.790 --> 29:25.920
because it acts in so many ways.

29:26.710 --> 29:32.290
You can pass through historical events, so many of them,

29:32.920 --> 29:37.750
and what will you find? A person who is so innocent,

29:37.960 --> 29:42.330
simple and wise

29:45.000 --> 29:49.750
is remembered all your life.

29:50.370 --> 29:54.330
I was a child, very small, when I was in school

29:55.920 --> 29:58.080
I used to go to the library

29:59.330 --> 30:04.120
and read about the lives of great men

30:04.920 --> 30:10.210
who have created some great things for us.

30:10.870 --> 30:12.750
So many of them.

30:13.370 --> 30:15.790
And I was so impressed

30:16.750 --> 30:23.120
how some of them were so simple, so child-like.

30:24.710 --> 30:28.040
For example Abraham Lincoln

30:29.330 --> 30:33.250
for whom I have tremendous, tremendous respect,

30:34.710 --> 30:37.210
was a man tortured by his wife also.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.830
She said “You don't know, you are very clumsy,

30:41.040 --> 30:46.670
you don't know how to dress up, you don't know how to behave”.

30:49.080 --> 30:56.370
And she actually was very harsh on him, all the time torturing him.

30:57.870 --> 31:00.960
Ultimately he was also killed.

31:01.830 --> 31:06.370
So one can say, “You see, what's the use of being Abraham Lincoln?

31:09.040 --> 31:14.250
Because he was killed, he was not successful.”

31:16.210 --> 31:18.960
Until today, all over the world,

31:19.210 --> 31:22.920
people know who was Abraham Lincoln.

31:24.710 --> 31:27.000
They don't know his wife – maybe.

31:32.830 --> 31:36.670
But they knew who was Abraham Lincoln, everybody.

31:37.960 --> 31:42.330
Clumsy man, according to her,

31:44.290 --> 31:47.830
and all sorts of degradation for him.

31:49.040 --> 31:54.670
But nobody respects her, nobody thinks anything about her.

31:55.750 --> 31:59.040
Who is respected today is Abraham Lincoln.

32:01.830 --> 32:06.790
Why? 'Actually he was murdered, he was killed,

32:06.960 --> 32:11.040
that shows that he had no strength to survive' –

32:12.250 --> 32:15.370
but he survived through ages!

32:17.830 --> 32:22.290
So many years have passed, still he's surviving.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.870
Take the case of all the great people

32:28.170 --> 32:30.670
who have been innocent;

32:31.250 --> 32:33.710
and that's why they had ideals.

32:34.670 --> 32:37.960
To them their ideals were more important than anything else,

32:38.290 --> 32:42.000
even their lives. Everything was nothing.

32:42.870 --> 32:46.170
Now the sense of ideals and idealism

32:46.330 --> 32:48.790
comes only from your innocence.

32:49.080 --> 32:54.000
That's the one which teaches you what is your ideal;

32:55.120 --> 32:57.170
how you should exist;

32:58.120 --> 33:01.370
what kind of a life you should lead.

33:02.290 --> 33:08.960
It is not important that you have big authorities,

33:09.170 --> 33:15.920
or you have a very big positions as ministers and all that.

33:16.670 --> 33:19.170
There have been so many who came and died.

33:20.750 --> 33:23.750
They had so many people with ambitions

33:24.710 --> 33:29.710
and so many people who were oppressive, but where are they?

33:30.250 --> 33:33.750
Nobody's bothered about them, nobody wants to look at them.

33:36.040 --> 33:39.830
If their photograph appears people close their eyes

33:40.000 --> 33:41.830
'No, no, we don't want to see this man'.

33:42.920 --> 33:46.750
But if there's a little boy, innocent child,

33:47.040 --> 33:50.290
who is talking in a very innocent manner,

33:51.290 --> 33:53.790
the whole world admires that child.

33:54.250 --> 33:58.210
And these great men are, really,

33:58.750 --> 34:02.210
they are the symbols of that innocence.

34:03.120 --> 34:08.750
Their main quality was innocence, from where the wisdom has come.

34:09.710 --> 34:13.170
Ganesha's main quality is his wisdom.

34:15.370 --> 34:19.210
He knew what was success, through his,

34:21.290 --> 34:24.120
I should say, innocent qualities.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.670
Sometimes the innocent people are not even aware of their

34:29.000 --> 34:31.080
quality of innocence.

34:32.170 --> 34:38.370
It's very surprising how the quality of innocence

34:38.830 --> 34:42.870
shines through human beings who may be very ordinary,

34:43.370 --> 34:45.920
who may be very

34:52.290 --> 34:58.370
who may be very simple, who may not look so intelligent and sharp,

34:59.710 --> 35:02.370
who may not become good diplomats, what ever it is –

35:02.960 --> 35:09.330
they are innocent! That's were ends all the glory of human beings.

35:10.210 --> 35:11.960
To be innocent –

35:13.870 --> 35:15.000
What's the matter?

35:20.750 --> 35:24.870
– so to be innocent, what do you do?

35:25.210 --> 35:30.920
People will say, “Mother, what do we do to be innocent?”

35:32.040 --> 35:39.920
Firstly, you can see for yourself

35:41.040 --> 35:42.870
how your mind works.

35:46.750 --> 35:50.790
What does it do? How it reacts.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.750
This is what one has to watch,

35:56.080 --> 35:58.330
which I call as 'introspection'.

36:00.290 --> 36:05.830
What sort of plans your mind takes to?

36:06.710 --> 36:12.330
What does it think is the best?

36:13.250 --> 36:16.040
In that thinking, thought process,

36:17.170 --> 36:24.670
what is the most important way to look at yourself?

36:27.370 --> 36:31.790
The first and the foremost is that

36:32.870 --> 36:35.710
you should know how you react to someone.

36:37.920 --> 36:43.750
Is it an innocent reaction? Or it is a vindictive reaction.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.370
It is very easy to see yourself,

36:48.920 --> 36:51.040
because now you are all Sahaja Yogi.

36:52.000 --> 36:56.250
You can see for yourself how is your reaction

36:57.370 --> 37:04.080
to any aggression on you, or any kind of a

37:06.120 --> 37:10.290
trouble coming on you. How do you react to that?

37:11.830 --> 37:13.830
What is your behaviour?

37:15.210 --> 37:20.290
If you are a very powerful person, then your behaviour is –

37:21.080 --> 37:25.830
for that you are not bothered. You see for yourself its

37:26.080 --> 37:28.670
just a stupid thing people are doing to you.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.120
Absolutely stupid.

37:31.830 --> 37:33.920
And when they are doing stupid things,

37:35.040 --> 37:36.960
why should we bother about them?

37:37.290 --> 37:40.080
Why should we waste our energy about them?

37:41.170 --> 37:48.000
It comes to a point where their stupidity is found out,

37:49.040 --> 37:54.670
in such a manner that all their lives and afterwards

37:55.120 --> 37:57.710
they are treated with contempt.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.370
People don't even want to take their names,

38:01.330 --> 38:04.000
they don't want to have their photographs,

38:04.920 --> 38:08.120
they don't want to have anything to do with them.

38:09.710 --> 38:12.960
At this time, at such a juncture,

38:14.040 --> 38:18.080
what happens is the people who are crooks,

38:18.870 --> 38:25.870
who are not innocent, who are against innocence,

38:26.960 --> 38:31.290
they start following them because it suits them better.

38:31.790 --> 38:36.290
It suits them to be aggressive, to be cunning

38:37.290 --> 38:40.040
and that's how a new group is formed –

38:40.370 --> 38:43.290
which we can call 'a satanic group'.

38:44.330 --> 38:48.370
And this satanic group also cannot do anything,

38:48.790 --> 38:52.710
anything whatsoever, to an innocent personality.

38:53.750 --> 38:55.370
There is a Sanskrit sloka like that –

38:56.960 --> 39:00.790
Nainam chidanti sashtrani – for the Spirit,

39:01.330 --> 39:04.710
'It cannot be killed by any weapon'.

39:05.790 --> 39:10.830
Nainam dahanti pavaka – 'No fire can burn it'.

39:11.710 --> 39:15.960
Sayanam cleydayantaposh naso sathe maratha –

39:16.330 --> 39:21.870
Marutha is the air, or we can call it wind,

39:22.290 --> 39:24.710
'Wind cannot also suck it',

39:25.080 --> 39:29.960
it is above all the nature, which is trying to destroy.

39:31.750 --> 39:35.830
But you will be amazed that nature understands.

39:36.290 --> 39:38.250
I told you, nature is innocent.

39:39.120 --> 39:42.960
It understands and it acts

39:43.750 --> 39:49.750
at the right moment, against the person who is aggressive,

39:50.290 --> 39:57.330
who is trying to malign

39:57.920 --> 40:00.710
or trouble an innocent person.

40:03.290 --> 40:09.000
In this way we should know that we have to worship our innocence.

40:09.830 --> 40:12.040
I know sometimes one feels

40:12.290 --> 40:14.710
that you are dominated because of that.

40:15.750 --> 40:21.250
Sometimes one feels sad that  'Why you are put to this kind

40:21.750 --> 40:23.790
of a treatment by others'.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.750
All kinds of things come to your mind.

40:27.210 --> 40:29.920
But if you worship your innocence,

40:30.170 --> 40:34.210
then you will be always a happy person,

40:35.040 --> 40:39.710
always a kind person, always be humble person.

40:40.670 --> 40:43.250
So, one has to be careful.

40:43.750 --> 40:45.370
You are your own destroyer!

40:46.040 --> 40:48.210
You are the one who kills, you see

40:48.790 --> 40:50.370
What do you say to it?

40:50.830 --> 40:53.370
Hitler destroyed himself; who has destroyed him?

40:53.790 --> 40:57.120
I mean in any way, everybody has to die so he would have been dead.

40:57.670 --> 41:01.120
But who has destroyed it forever is himself.

41:01.830 --> 41:04.710
So, you kill yourself –

41:05.250 --> 41:08.790
through this you can save yourself

41:09.210 --> 41:13.790
and become very glorified if you are innocent.

41:14.120 --> 41:17.000
Have faith in the power of innocence.

41:18.000 --> 41:23.790
What is important is, how you show in your own life

41:24.370 --> 41:29.370
the power of innocence, how you behave towards each other,

41:29.870 --> 41:33.370
and that is what is what, is what I call 'the love'.

41:34.920 --> 41:37.830
You cannot be compassionate unless and until

41:38.710 --> 41:40.960
you have this attitude towards yourself.

41:41.960 --> 41:44.960
You cannot be kind. Temporarily you might feel this,

41:45.170 --> 41:49.120
but a permanently compassionate temperament comes

41:49.330 --> 41:54.080
only through the permanent flowing of innocence

41:54.290 --> 41:55.830
through your character.

41:56.790 --> 41:59.330
It's such a transparent thing in a human being

42:00.370 --> 42:05.330
and that it sustains, it overpowers all other things,

42:05.830 --> 42:12.790
leave alone the time – thousands of years people will not forget

42:13.040 --> 42:18.250
you the Sahaja Yogi, if you show your valour

42:19.120 --> 42:23.670
and your strength of your innocence.

42:24.120 --> 42:28.370
I'm sorry for today's programme being so late,

42:29.290 --> 42:32.040
but you know I was ready to come

42:33.670 --> 42:39.210
but the marriages are becoming the main function now.

42:40.790 --> 42:42.830
Because it came so late,

42:43.330 --> 42:46.790
that till the last minute we were deciding about marriages.

42:47.290 --> 42:51.750
But I am telling you this is the last time. Next time we'll stop it.

42:52.710 --> 42:57.960
You must send your applications

42:59.290 --> 43:04.670
at least eight days before, and for Ganapatipule it is two weeks.

43:04.960 --> 43:11.870
Otherwise – there are only twenty-four hours in a day,

43:12.960 --> 43:15.250
and you cannot increase those!

43:16.370 --> 43:19.830
Now there is one humble request I have to make,

43:20.120 --> 43:24.710
that if you want to settle your marriage,

43:25.250 --> 43:31.370
then please do it in a way that I can have time to see.

43:32.210 --> 43:35.000
Otherwise I'll leave it to others to decide.

43:35.330 --> 43:37.330
If you like, it can be done.

43:38.960 --> 43:41.830
So a simple thing is this to understand,

43:42.120 --> 43:44.670
that marriage is a very important thing.

43:45.710 --> 43:48.330
You can create innocent children if you are married.

43:49.370 --> 43:53.370
But if you behave in this manner, little, little responsible –

43:55.170 --> 44:00.370
so I have to request you to understand the value of time.

44:01.080 --> 44:06.670
Because from next time I can assure you we cannot have marriages

44:07.120 --> 44:11.170
if you send your applications so late.

44:11.830 --> 44:14.250
It should be within one week's time,

44:15.920 --> 44:18.040
I hope you'll understand that.

44:18.290 --> 44:19.670
Thank you very much.
