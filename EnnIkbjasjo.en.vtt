00:00.060 --> 00:03.060
Shri Guru Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 04 July 1993.

00:03.373 --> 00:08.293
Today we are going to have Guru Puja.

00:10.528 --> 00:14.139
I’m supposed to be your guru,

00:16.813 --> 00:24.650
but I feel sometimes that the idea of a guru

00:25.039 --> 00:29.180
is very different from Mine.

00:31.862 --> 00:37.382
Normally, a guru is a very, very strict person

00:37.946 --> 00:41.655
and has no patience of any kind.

00:43.457 --> 00:51.284
Even, say music, there are gurus who teach music in India,

00:53.681 --> 01:01.866
so all the disciplines have to be absolutely followed.

01:03.429 --> 01:08.447
I know about this great musician, Ravi Shankar.

01:10.106 --> 01:13.633
We had been to Maihar where he came

01:15.625 --> 01:20.868
and my father was very much respected by his guru, Allahudin Khan.

01:21.069 --> 01:23.327
So he asked him, “Why don’t you play something.”

01:23.527 --> 01:25.506
So he didn’t tell him anything that time.

01:25.706 --> 01:31.333
Then he showed a big bump here. He said, “Sir, do you see this?”

01:31.533 --> 01:35.233
He said, “What?” “My own tanpura,

01:35.433 --> 01:43.512
he broke on my head because I was little bit out of tune.”

01:45.227 --> 01:47.696
Otherwise, he was a very nice man, I must say.

01:47.897 --> 01:53.088
I knew Allahudin Khan sahab, but when it came to teaching,

01:56.262 --> 01:58.982
it’s a tradition I think

02:00.213 --> 02:07.807
that you have to put all kinds of disciplines on the students,

02:11.264 --> 02:13.546
but still the students stick on to the guru.

02:13.746 --> 02:17.947
They look after all the time. They’re bothered with the guru.

02:18.148 --> 02:22.609
He wants this thing, they’ll run. If he wants this, they’ll do.

02:23.927 --> 02:31.948
A guru goes on taking different types of tests of the disciple.

02:32.924 --> 02:35.799
Like Shivaji’s guru asked him that

02:35.999 --> 02:41.583
“I would like drink the milk of a tigress.”

02:43.338 --> 02:45.038
So he said, “All right.”

02:45.238 --> 02:48.755
If my guru has said it, it is his lookout.

02:49.074 --> 02:55.264
So went to the forest and he saw a tigress sitting there.

02:55.757 --> 03:00.086
She had already finished giving milk to her cubs,

03:00.286 --> 03:04.488
so he bowed before the tigress and he said,

03:05.028 --> 03:07.872
“See, my guru wants your milk.

03:08.325 --> 03:11.504
Will you please give some milk for my guru?”

03:11.704 --> 03:13.634
And the tigress understood it.

03:13.834 --> 03:19.750
She stood up and he took out the milk of the tigress for the guru.

03:20.091 --> 03:25.291
So, in this, one can see in the obedience of the guru,

03:25.696 --> 03:30.643
one achieves even the impossible things.

03:33.079 --> 03:39.818
Another time his guru said that he has got a big boil on his leg

03:40.397 --> 03:46.183
and that it is all right and anybody who will suck it,

03:48.390 --> 03:50.649
so has to be my disciple

03:50.849 --> 03:54.207
and my disciple, when he sucks it, I will be all right.

03:54.407 --> 03:59.260
Everybody was so averse to a thing like that.

03:59.980 --> 04:03.391
Shivaji maharaj said, “Of course I will suck it.”

04:03.591 --> 04:06.181
He bend down. And he started sucking it

04:06.381 --> 04:12.520
from the bandage that was there and it was a mango.

04:14.813 --> 04:22.236
So there are two, three types of tests are all the time taken

04:23.942 --> 04:31.380
of the disciple. Firstly, how much they obey you.

04:35.407 --> 04:43.981
But, as you all have got Realization and you are your own gurus,

04:45.394 --> 04:50.252
I don’t put that condition on you.

04:52.538 --> 04:58.557
I leave it to your freedom. I tell you earnestly,

05:00.302 --> 05:05.767
in all the way possible, what I think good for you,

05:07.570 --> 05:17.128
but I don’t compel like these gurus used to do.

05:17.328 --> 05:24.437
I mean, they used to beat. They used to hang them on the well.

05:27.123 --> 05:30.188
They were so very strict

05:30.388 --> 05:34.616
with their disciples and I’ve had an experience of this.

05:36.148 --> 05:40.980
They never used to smile. No question of laughing.

05:43.274 --> 05:49.463
And would never show any kind of weakness

05:49.663 --> 05:52.827
of kindness for the disciples.

05:54.185 --> 05:57.427
This is about the spiritual gurus I am telling you,

05:57.627 --> 06:04.186
but those who wanted their ascent, wanted their Realization

06:05.369 --> 06:10.306
would go on passing through all kinds of tortures

06:10.527 --> 06:12.790
that they put on them.

06:14.544 --> 06:17.551
Some of the gurus who didn’t like some disciples,

06:18.297 --> 06:20.002
they would tell them, “All right,

06:20.202 --> 06:23.529
you now stand on your one leg all the time.”

06:24.523 --> 06:28.936
So they’re standing on one leg like a crane.

06:30.753 --> 06:37.293
Another one, they would say that “you stand on your head.”

06:41.901 --> 06:50.115
The way they used to treat their disciples

06:52.052 --> 06:58.021
was rather difficult for Me. I can’t do it.

07:02.838 --> 07:09.343
All the time the compassion becomes the tears in My eyes.

07:09.544 --> 07:16.412
I find it impossible. I may just say it in a way,

07:16.768 --> 07:24.885
sometimes also, say it in a way that looks like little scolding,

07:25.925 --> 07:30.439
but to be a Mother and to be a guru is the most difficult thing.

07:36.002 --> 07:42.751
I do not know what comes first, but, of course, every mother wants

07:42.952 --> 07:49.274
her child to be good and the Holy Mother wants

07:49.475 --> 07:52.366
Her child to be a holy person.

07:54.421 --> 07:57.715
The first thing is the holiness.

07:58.358 --> 08:04.092
Now for that, how can you compel someone?

08:08.660 --> 08:16.572
Only thing that makes you understand is this

08:18.659 --> 08:26.910
that if you don’t become holy, how will you get your ascent?

08:30.068 --> 08:32.116
We have to be holy.

08:34.228 --> 08:38.964
What discipline one can put for making a person holy?

08:41.361 --> 08:46.567
What can you force? What can you get angry for?

08:51.531 --> 08:55.274
Only method I use normally is to forgive.

08:58.202 --> 09:03.338
Maybe the forgiveness is the highest quality, I think,

09:03.539 --> 09:05.314
for teaching people.

09:08.898 --> 09:12.866
When they know that they have done wrong and they confess it,

09:13.067 --> 09:15.584
then you have to forgive.

09:17.552 --> 09:22.183
Like in the life of Buddha, there was a man

09:23.897 --> 09:32.707
who was abusing him

09:35.019 --> 09:37.692
without understanding

09:37.892 --> 09:44.800
and when he finished with his abuses and Buddha had left,

09:45.000 --> 09:48.044
people told him, “Do you know whom you were abusing?”

09:48.245 --> 09:53.206
It was Lord Buddha. Got a fright of his life.

09:54.214 --> 09:58.293
He said, “Where is he gone?” “He has gone to another village.”

09:58.580 --> 10:01.735
So he went to another village and he said, “Sir,

10:01.936 --> 10:06.057
I am sorry for what I said. Please forgive me. It’s all wrong

10:11.010 --> 10:15.846
and I should not have done it. You can punish me the way you like.”

10:17.021 --> 10:19.573
Lord Buddha said, “When did you do that?”

10:19.774 --> 10:23.473
He said, “Yesterday.” He said, “I don’t know yesterday.

10:23.673 --> 10:25.490
I know only today.”

10:29.109 --> 10:31.553
You see, even you tell these things,

10:31.754 --> 10:34.101
how great one feels, isn’t it?

10:34.887 --> 10:39.323
So your greatness, your nobility

10:41.421 --> 10:45.180
will definitely influence people.

10:45.919 --> 10:49.854
It’s not by fighting, by quarrelling,

10:50.054 --> 10:55.419
by saying harsh things it is going to work out.

10:58.030 --> 11:04.219
Also the gurus used to control the children very much,

11:04.482 --> 11:09.398
the disciples very much, absolutely control.

11:10.240 --> 11:14.280
You have to get up at four o’clock, sit down for meditation.

11:14.481 --> 11:17.839
If you have not got up, they would beat.

11:20.799 --> 11:23.314
I can’t understand. Sahaja

11:26.435 --> 11:29.251
Yoga is very different

11:31.640 --> 11:40.335
from all other gurus that we believe in the power of love.

11:45.826 --> 11:50.934
Power of love teaches you how to be forgiving.

11:53.612 --> 11:55.878
It makes you noble.

11:58.735 --> 12:04.036
It makes you very balanced.

12:06.699 --> 12:11.276
So the gurus who were there for bhavasagara

12:12.720 --> 12:19.177
to establish dharma in the human beings,

12:23.118 --> 12:26.514
first thing, they had to balance themselves

12:28.863 --> 12:35.913
against all practical things, as they call it.

12:37.493 --> 12:39.897
They think it is not practical,

12:41.547 --> 12:51.627
but they said, “No, for us, this is higher, nobler and important.”

12:53.727 --> 12:56.238
So they would balance people

12:56.439 --> 13:01.453
because they had this power of love within themselves.

13:02.977 --> 13:06.890
All these Adi Gurus and their incarnations, if you see them,

13:07.117 --> 13:15.830
they always had balance and always praised the love of God.

13:22.124 --> 13:32.267
When we talk about Realization, one has to know, first of all,

13:32.467 --> 13:36.155
that we have to have patience with ourselves.

13:38.108 --> 13:42.750
I know some people don’t feel so good,

13:43.932 --> 13:46.888
some people still have sicknesses.

13:47.373 --> 13:51.460
Some people don’t even feel vibrations sometimes.

13:53.408 --> 13:56.358
Have patience with yourself.

13:56.559 --> 13:59.186
When you become your own guru, first thing,

13:59.387 --> 14:05.436
as the guru has patience with his or her disciple,

14:05.637 --> 14:08.784
you must have patience with yourself.

14:13.439 --> 14:22.121
In that patience, you will learn that you can tolerate

14:23.800 --> 14:26.797
so many things without any trouble.

14:29.122 --> 14:31.919
They say one person who goes on grudging,

14:32.120 --> 14:35.229
“Oh, this is not good. That is not good”

14:40.689 --> 14:44.577
because they have no patience with themselves.

14:45.720 --> 14:52.041
If you have patience with yourself, everything you’ll accept.

14:54.771 --> 14:57.128
Wherever you are, you are with yourself

14:57.328 --> 14:59.592
because you’re realized souls.

14:59.792 --> 15:05.518
So you won’t frustrate, you’ll not get angry

15:10.475 --> 15:14.721
and also you’ll not go on grumbling and grudging

15:15.412 --> 15:18.225
because you’re enjoying yourself.

15:19.646 --> 15:23.679
Even if there’s a mattress, all right.

15:23.880 --> 15:26.016
If there isn’t, you can sleep on the grass.

15:26.217 --> 15:28.724
If there’s no grass, you can sleep on the stone.

15:28.924 --> 15:32.470
And also you need not sleep like last night,

15:34.795 --> 15:37.578
makes no difference whatsoever.

15:40.444 --> 15:42.234
The first thing I find with people,

15:42.472 --> 15:45.686
they have no patience with themselves.

15:47.344 --> 15:51.803
Firstly, maybe, because they’re conditioned.

15:52.003 --> 15:54.632
Say, if you have a left Vishuddhi,

15:54.832 --> 15:59.184
by any chance you have been a Catholic or T.M. or something,

16:00.882 --> 16:03.510
then all the time you start pitying yourself,

16:03.710 --> 16:06.550
thinking no end of your miseries and troubles

16:06.750 --> 16:10.004
and always try to condemn yourself.

16:10.204 --> 16:12.287
You are a realized soul

16:12.748 --> 16:17.275
and you have no business to condemn yourself, no business.

16:23.124 --> 16:26.651
Like a person who’s getting drowned, has been saved,

16:26.851 --> 16:30.577
has come to the shore, now is doing nicely,

16:32.474 --> 16:35.049
has got his second life

16:35.517 --> 16:41.196
and there he’s still trying to express his agony,

16:41.396 --> 16:44.031
as if he’s getting drowned.

16:45.892 --> 16:50.301
So you have to awaken yourself. “No, no, no more I am there.

16:50.501 --> 16:55.869
I’m finished. It’s gone now. I am different.

16:56.488 --> 17:01.276
That was somebody else. I am not the same person.”

17:02.268 --> 17:06.977
This is how you have to tell yourself very clearly

17:07.177 --> 17:10.451
that “I am not going to condemn myself.”

17:15.197 --> 17:19.859
It was your right to get Self Realization. You got it.

17:23.136 --> 17:27.263
And then you cannot enjoy it because you have these conditionings,

17:27.463 --> 17:32.300
especially in the West to be miserable, it is very fashionable.

17:35.133 --> 17:39.648
There are miseries of people who have no miseries.

17:52.215 --> 18:01.057
So, for such people who have imaginary miseries of the past,

18:01.257 --> 18:03.641
which do not exist in reality,

18:03.841 --> 18:08.099
they cannot have the joy of reality. They cannot.

18:10.821 --> 18:18.593
So, for a Sahaja Yogi, it’s important that he should have joy

18:25.887 --> 18:30.952
within his heart. It’s like an ocean.

18:32.118 --> 18:40.657
It’s like an ocean which is there all the time

18:44.566 --> 18:50.200
to give you such thrills.

18:53.599 --> 18:59.568
Even little drops of this ocean,

19:00.949 --> 19:07.400
when they trickle down in your being, it is so soothing.

19:08.694 --> 19:12.729
The experience can be only experienced.

19:16.015 --> 19:20.043
It’s all waiting within yourself.

19:28.304 --> 19:32.898
And such a person also makes others joyous.

19:35.382 --> 19:39.844
He cannot see another person unhappy, in trouble.

19:41.272 --> 19:49.308
Himself is full of joy and spreads joy all around.

19:50.494 --> 19:53.874
You can get joy from small, small things

19:54.716 --> 19:57.216
because you have the ocean

19:58.287 --> 20:00.477
and a little thing that drops into the ocean

20:00.677 --> 20:05.188
creates such beautiful ripples. They touch the shores,

20:07.283 --> 20:11.202
not only of your own being, but of others.

20:12.622 --> 20:19.175
Very, very small things make you so very happy

20:20.699 --> 20:22.950
and that all the time

20:23.150 --> 20:26.843
you are just like a surfing, as they call it these days,

20:27.043 --> 20:32.142
on this beautiful lake or a beautiful ocean of love.

20:34.554 --> 20:39.460
Love is joy-giving. It’s not carnal love.

20:40.920 --> 20:44.014
It is Divine Love.

20:44.569 --> 20:51.147
So, as Sahaja Yogis and as gurus, we have to love ourselves

20:51.877 --> 20:54.165
and understand our own value.

20:54.365 --> 20:59.823
I think Sahaja Yogis have not yet understood their value.

21:00.024 --> 21:04.175
How many people in this world can give Realization?

21:07.918 --> 21:11.473
How many know about kundalini?

21:12.949 --> 21:20.061
How many have seen people being resurrected all the time?

21:24.576 --> 21:29.655
You are made so powerful

21:33.779 --> 21:37.767
that even looking at people, you can give Realization.

21:46.381 --> 21:50.486
In ordinary love, in carnal love people have fear.

21:52.351 --> 21:58.394
They’re afraid that their beloved might depart

21:58.595 --> 22:02.076
or might get sick, might happen this

22:05.044 --> 22:13.323
and they might all the time be under fear, resist enjoying.

22:16.141 --> 22:24.398
But, for you, you are with yourself and you are always protected.

22:30.087 --> 22:38.038
If your attention is bad for a second even,

22:38.238 --> 22:41.585
immediately you know you are going wrong.

22:41.785 --> 22:44.828
You protect yourself from yourself.

22:49.359 --> 22:54.153
As soon as you get some physical problem, you can feel it.

22:54.353 --> 22:57.006
You know how to cure yourself.

22:58.665 --> 23:02.092
But again, one has to have balance.

23:03.021 --> 23:06.072
If you’re off the balance,

23:06.707 --> 23:09.742
then you don’t even feel vibrations,

23:10.075 --> 23:14.040
you don’t even feel what’s wrong with you.

23:14.240 --> 23:17.591
You don’t know which direction you are moving,

23:17.791 --> 23:20.604
whether you are getting destroyed.

23:21.659 --> 23:27.442
And this balance has to be established by all the Sahaja Yogis.

23:38.226 --> 23:45.531
These imbalances come to us because we still think about our past

23:45.731 --> 23:47.996
or maybe about our future.

23:49.719 --> 23:52.064
We worry about these things.

23:54.492 --> 23:59.011
What is there to worry when all the angels and all the ganas

23:59.211 --> 24:01.102
are working for you?

24:02.896 --> 24:05.945
You just have to order, that’s all.

24:08.278 --> 24:12.799
But it’s like sometimes a person is made a king

24:12.999 --> 24:19.587
and is put on a throne, but before that he was a beggar,

24:19.787 --> 24:23.161
so anybody who comes to bow before him, he says,

24:23.361 --> 24:27.428
“All right. Give me one pound.”

24:31.273 --> 24:34.576
You have to know that you are all realized souls

24:34.776 --> 24:38.699
and that you have all the powers within you.

24:40.128 --> 24:44.307
Only thing which is very important is the balance.

24:45.585 --> 24:50.863
In Sahaja Yoga also people get into imbalances.

24:54.889 --> 25:03.794
How? Like I have seen people

25:06.036 --> 25:10.913
who are, say, afraid of these worldly laws.

25:14.926 --> 25:24.396
They don’t know there is such a powerful energy all around you.

25:28.749 --> 25:34.988
Nothing can stop you. Nothing can arrest you.

25:35.188 --> 25:37.568
Nothing can find faults.

25:37.768 --> 25:42.353
But when you start doubting, like yesterday’s doubting,

25:42.553 --> 25:45.517
when you say, “But, but.”

25:46.873 --> 25:52.799
When you start thinking about the man-made laws,

25:52.999 --> 25:55.574
then the God’s laws fail.

26:00.493 --> 26:03.511
Otherwise, nobody can punish you, nobody can arrest you,

26:03.711 --> 26:08.984
nobody can do anything to you. You are absolutely protected.

26:14.085 --> 26:22.012
So the main difference between the old style of guru

26:22.212 --> 26:26.058
and the modern style of guru is this

26:26.931 --> 26:31.801
that the old gurus used to you must suffer. All right,

26:32.002 --> 26:34.023
you have to be arrested is very good.

26:34.224 --> 26:37.219
If they give you poison, take the poison.

26:37.419 --> 26:40.318
If they want to slap you, take slaps.

26:40.518 --> 26:42.944
Whatever they want to do, you should accept

26:43.144 --> 26:45.422
because is your suffering.

26:45.622 --> 26:49.601
Not in Sahaja Yoga because your Mother is sitting here.

26:50.220 --> 26:52.736
How dare anybody touch you.

26:57.893 --> 27:02.773
No one can harm you. You have to believe Me when I say that.

27:03.456 --> 27:08.698
No one can harm you, but you must have that faith within yourself.

27:10.952 --> 27:14.875
Nobody had Adi Shakti as the Guru.

27:17.645 --> 27:21.617
Adi Shakti, the one who has all the powers of the world.

27:21.817 --> 27:27.535
So who can harm you? Who can torture you?

27:28.083 --> 27:30.083
Who can trouble you except for yourself?

27:30.283 --> 27:34.204
If you want to torture yourself, nobody can harm you.

27:37.092 --> 27:41.939
So the greatest difference between this disciple of other gurus

27:42.139 --> 27:46.158
and yourself is you don’t have to suffer.

27:49.106 --> 27:55.994
You are not to suffer and even, you see,

27:56.478 --> 27:59.316
if there’s somebody who has some negativity, that person,

27:59.517 --> 28:02.881
some Sahaja Yogis still carry on poor things they cannot help it

28:03.082 --> 28:06.074
they have been to wrong gurus or something.

28:06.384 --> 28:10.828
So they’ll meet with an accident,

28:11.408 --> 28:15.943
maybe they might face something terrible,

28:16.808 --> 28:20.221
but suddenly they’ll find they will get out of it.

28:20.421 --> 28:22.510
Maybe the negativity of somebody else,

28:22.710 --> 28:27.665
some relations, some brothers, sisters or maybe of the nation.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.177
But you’ll get out of it.

28:38.169 --> 28:42.338
It is a very remarkable thing in Sahaja Yoga

28:42.538 --> 28:46.558
that there are people who catching.

28:47.327 --> 28:51.610
“Mother, my heart is catching. My this is catching. That is catching.”

28:51.810 --> 28:56.512
But once they want to give Realization, just moves, kundalini moves.

28:57.496 --> 29:02.297
Whatever you may be, whatever may be your problems,

29:02.646 --> 29:05.848
but you raise your hand and kundalini moves.

29:06.713 --> 29:08.668
I mean, any instrument which is spoiled,

29:08.868 --> 29:11.470
say, supposing this fan is spoiled, it won’t work.

29:11.670 --> 29:15.790
But not Sahaja Yogis.

29:15.991 --> 29:22.951
They work out, of course,

29:23.151 --> 29:27.541
if they don’t practice Sahaja Yoga

29:27.741 --> 29:30.818
or if they don’t give Realizations to others,

29:31.018 --> 29:35.172
then, of course, it can be a junk then.

29:36.774 --> 29:39.670
Supposing you don’t use your car, may be very good

29:39.870 --> 29:43.013
and you don’t use it, it becomes a junk.

29:44.656 --> 29:49.243
So you have to give. You have to give Realization.

29:49.443 --> 29:52.522
All of you, whether it’s women or men.

29:53.792 --> 29:58.338
Whatever country you may belong, you have to give Realization,

29:58.538 --> 30:05.890
you have to allow this energy to go and work,

30:06.555 --> 30:12.884
otherwise it will suffocate.

30:14.233 --> 30:18.526
I’ve seen many Sahaja Yogis who have not done anything like that.

30:18.726 --> 30:22.347
They are very nice to you. Mother, we worship you at home.

30:22.547 --> 30:25.896
They suffer also from arthritis

30:28.781 --> 30:32.692
or other kinds of things,

30:33.723 --> 30:37.798
spondylitis’ sometimes they will have or

30:38.442 --> 30:42.370
they may have cellulitis or all kinds of things they can have.

30:42.973 --> 30:50.861
So you have to use your energy for giving Realizations to others.

30:54.186 --> 30:58.181
It’s all right, in protocol, if you don’t understand,

30:58.381 --> 31:00.086
you are forgiven.

31:00.792 --> 31:06.006
Anything you might do out of innocence or ignorance is forgiven.

31:07.625 --> 31:11.505
But knowingly, if you want to do something,

31:14.450 --> 31:17.311
then I don’t know repercussions

31:19.827 --> 31:24.694
because the area where you are is safe,

31:25.598 --> 31:29.419
but if you want to get out of that area,

31:31.769 --> 31:37.745
then all sides there are horrible negative forces working

31:37.945 --> 31:40.821
and you are captured into that.

31:41.782 --> 31:46.881
That’s not a mistake of Sahaja Yoga.

31:49.722 --> 31:55.430
To find faults with Sahaja Yogis or with Sahaja Yoga

31:55.883 --> 31:59.365
is another mistake we commit sometime.

32:00.967 --> 32:08.047
Say there are ten disciples with a guru, very good excellent guru,

32:08.840 --> 32:13.921
if they complain about any one of them,

32:17.267 --> 32:21.991
immediately the guru will say, “You get out.”

32:28.543 --> 32:33.312
They have no business to complain about each other.

32:35.066 --> 32:38.502
On the contrary, like this hand is paining,

32:38.703 --> 32:41.324
then this hand doesn’t complain to the brain,

32:41.525 --> 32:43.657
but tries to soothe it.

32:48.468 --> 32:57.922
So Sahaja Yogis are gurus who belong to the collective.

32:59.834 --> 33:03.980
They move in a group, as described by Gnyaneshwara,

33:04.710 --> 33:10.176
that you move now like the enlightened forest,

33:12.676 --> 33:18.917
which gives whatever people like, want to have, kalpatarus.

33:22.250 --> 33:30.727
And he said you move like oceans and talk about God.

33:31.264 --> 33:34.210
It’s not one single man standing and saying something.

33:34.411 --> 33:38.920
We saw yesterday in drama how a single man had to suffer.

33:41.286 --> 33:43.602
But you are in a group

33:45.721 --> 33:50.900
and all of you move in a group, together,

33:53.261 --> 33:55.519
with one understanding.

33:56.773 --> 33:59.666
Such a powerful group it is.

34:02.968 --> 34:08.669
They bring ambrosia to the people, according to Gnyaneshwara.

34:10.970 --> 34:17.254
But this power of collectivity that one feels

34:17.921 --> 34:20.964
is the first judgement of a person.

34:22.821 --> 34:30.878
Those who cannot be collective are not yet Sahaja Yogis.

34:34.624 --> 34:39.264
Some people think that they have served Me,

34:39.464 --> 34:44.281
they have looked after Me, they do My Puja or something,

34:44.968 --> 34:50.497
so that they have a right to scold others, to get angry with others,

34:50.697 --> 34:54.709
shout at them, tell them work, do all kinds of thing.

34:57.122 --> 34:58.799
It’s not so.

35:00.514 --> 35:04.305
You are a Sahaja Yogi when you are absolutely collective.

35:04.505 --> 35:09.454
Otherwise you are not a Sahaja Yogi when you are not collective.

35:11.469 --> 35:16.408
It’s so simple.

35:16.616 --> 35:22.386
That ego, the conditionings of ego

35:23.251 --> 35:30.932
or conditionings of the past may keep you away from others

35:31.210 --> 35:35.193
and there is no connection to the Divine any more left.

35:35.393 --> 35:37.426
Those who are not collective people

35:37.626 --> 35:40.547
have no relationship with the Divine.

35:45.721 --> 35:50.504
You have understood now what is collectivity is.

35:50.705 --> 35:56.597
Most surprising thing is for Me that by giving Realizations to you,

35:56.797 --> 36:03.909
I find it very easy to talk about subtlest of subtle things to you.

36:06.114 --> 36:10.566
All these things I don’t think any guru could have talked.

36:11.367 --> 36:15.705
Not possible. It would not go into their heads.

36:16.490 --> 36:21.195
Very subtle, it is. You have become subtle

36:22.052 --> 36:27.888
and the subtleties have their own beauty in expression,

36:28.103 --> 36:32.581
in expression, in talking,

36:32.782 --> 36:37.417
in behaving with others, in understanding.

36:37.617 --> 36:40.899
It’s so sweet and so beautiful.

36:43.693 --> 36:53.434
The collective feeling is something like

36:53.634 --> 37:01.721
a little particle of clay thinks it is a mountain,

37:04.153 --> 37:07.181
like a drop becoming the ocean.

37:09.102 --> 37:12.551
But if there’s one drop who says, “No, no, no. I can’t be collective.

37:12.752 --> 37:15.114
I stay on the shore.” All right,

37:15.322 --> 37:17.847
the sunshine will evaporate.

37:20.395 --> 37:25.656
“But, Mother, I worship you. I do this. I do that.”

37:26.625 --> 37:29.099
With all that, if you do not develop collectivity,

37:29.299 --> 37:31.196
better not worship Me.

37:34.252 --> 37:40.739
For that, how a guru should act with the collective?

37:44.325 --> 37:47.956
In Sahaja Yoga nobody should feel

37:48.786 --> 37:53.353
that you are some hierarchy or a higher personality.

37:54.052 --> 37:57.467
If you start feeling like that, then at that point,

37:57.667 --> 38:01.126
you must know that there is some possession on you.

38:07.866 --> 38:09.805
What is the highest in the water? Nothing.

38:10.005 --> 38:13.332
Everything is just the same. It’s the way it is there.

38:13.532 --> 38:18.703
It has to be used for its own purposes.

38:22.390 --> 38:29.167
And the cruelties sometimes people indulge into is unimaginable.

38:35.617 --> 38:41.246
How can this kind of satisfaction

38:41.447 --> 38:47.025
be there if you are Sahaja Yogis?

38:48.235 --> 38:51.526
I don’t know. They say so, that gurus used to beat

38:51.726 --> 38:57.151
and they used to do all kinds of things. There must be bhoots. No.

38:58.882 --> 39:04.046
A very angry gurus. You cannot afford to be angry.

39:04.247 --> 39:08.931
Cannot afford. Anger means imbalance.

39:10.629 --> 39:14.004
You get attached to, say, your family,

39:14.700 --> 39:18.438
start talking like that and no more.

39:22.657 --> 39:27.770
Attachment to anything shows you have no balance.

39:31.143 --> 39:35.915
Those who are balanced have to be detached.

39:39.399 --> 39:42.579
Otherwise you get attached to somebody.

39:42.779 --> 39:47.627
This is my daughter. This is my son. This is this.

39:47.827 --> 39:50.881
Then you don’t see the truth.

39:53.246 --> 39:55.888
So any kind of attachment,

39:59.738 --> 40:04.598
if you feel then know that you are not in balance.

40:07.288 --> 40:12.882
Also I’ve seen people get into a kind of a pride,

40:19.141 --> 40:22.010
pride that we are Sahaja Yogis.

40:25.752 --> 40:29.123
We have become Sahaja Yogis to save the whole world.

40:29.323 --> 40:32.420
It’s like I see so many government servants who think

40:32.620 --> 40:36.922
no end of themselves. They’re servants of the people.

40:39.637 --> 40:44.240
They may be called officers, but officers to serve.

40:45.732 --> 40:49.388
In the same way, we are in this world to serve God

40:49.588 --> 40:53.807
and the purpose of your service is to save the world,

40:54.933 --> 40:56.791
save the people.

40:57.680 --> 41:05.546
But if you have pride, false pride, how can you do that?

41:06.963 --> 41:12.141
The way you’ll talk, the way you’ll behave, nobody will come near.

41:18.925 --> 41:23.787
You cannot be jealous of another person, cannot be

41:29.574 --> 41:39.309
because jealousy means

41:39.510 --> 41:44.836
that you are trying to harm yourself really.

41:45.036 --> 41:49.088
I don’t know what jealousy is so much.

41:49.493 --> 41:52.145
I see people getting jealous,

41:52.345 --> 41:56.633
but I don’t know what it is really, jealousy.

41:56.833 --> 41:59.504
The funny stuff, isn’t it?

42:03.329 --> 42:08.998
It must be coming from animal kingdom maybe, I don’t know,

42:10.474 --> 42:15.598
because what is there to be jealous. I mean, you are realized souls.

42:22.010 --> 42:26.425
How can you be jealous of anyone?

42:26.625 --> 42:34.353
Say, supposing you are a diamond and another one is a diamond.

42:34.553 --> 42:39.703
Very good. Both put together will become even more brilliant.

42:41.894 --> 42:47.737
Now, supposing somebody is no good and you are very good,

42:49.880 --> 42:54.299
then there is nothing to feel jealous of the man who is no good.

42:54.499 --> 43:01.217
Or also somebody who is good, to feel jealous, what is your gain?

43:02.082 --> 43:05.231
If you think that gentleman is good or that lady’s good,

43:05.431 --> 43:10.463
better try to follow what she is doing, how is she good,

43:10.663 --> 43:13.636
how she has got this goodness.

43:17.636 --> 43:19.858
It’s better to study.

43:21.898 --> 43:26.492
I really enjoy the most when Sahaja Yogis start

43:27.619 --> 43:31.531
expressing their feelings about other Sahaja Yogis.

43:34.642 --> 43:38.400
“Mother, he’s like that. Mother, he’s like that.”

43:40.416 --> 43:43.707
So, they see the goodness of others.

43:43.907 --> 43:48.084
They see the greatness of others, the nobility of others

43:48.284 --> 43:51.966
and when you start seeing that, you start becoming.

43:57.266 --> 44:02.083
If you feel jealous, I mean,

44:02.392 --> 44:05.609
I don’t know what sort of a thing it is, as I told you.

44:05.809 --> 44:09.379
But you are condemning yourself permanently.

44:09.579 --> 44:13.185
Today you are jealous of somebody because he has black hair.

44:13.385 --> 44:16.404
You are jealous of somebody because he has grey hair.

44:16.604 --> 44:20.050
You’re jealous of somebody because he has got a long nose,

44:20.250 --> 44:24.070
jealous of somebody because he has got a short nose.

44:25.594 --> 44:28.344
[Shri Mataji speaks to a Sahaja Yogi:] What is happening?

44:28.545 --> 44:31.689
What happened? Ha?

44:36.971 --> 44:39.624
Are you a Sahaja Yogi?

44:39.824 --> 44:43.906
You are a Sahaja Yogi. Then you know the protocol. Let Me speak.

44:44.106 --> 44:46.434
All right? You can ask Me later on.

44:46.634 --> 44:50.501
This is not the way. This is not a parliament here.

44:50.701 --> 44:54.706
I know. I know that I don’t force any discipline,

44:54.907 --> 44:57.324
but this should be self discipline.

44:57.524 --> 45:00.449
You should be self-disciplined.

45:01.853 --> 45:04.387
I’m speaking just now. Listen to Me.

45:04.587 --> 45:08.797
Maybe I might answer you in My speech.

45:17.244 --> 45:26.458
So the relationship among yourselves

45:26.831 --> 45:33.117
cannot have anything to do with jealousy. Cannot.

45:34.990 --> 45:37.941
Because it kills your joy.

45:46.640 --> 45:53.711
Now, as I told you, that you get rid of your fear.

45:54.116 --> 45:56.952
You get rid of your jealousies.

45:57.190 --> 46:05.708
You get rid of your pride,

46:05.909 --> 46:08.304
false one.

46:08.505 --> 46:14.065
And also you get rid of your impatience.

46:17.291 --> 46:19.992
You must have patience.

46:20.192 --> 46:28.428
This is another style of guru

46:29.475 --> 46:33.501
who has patience, tremendous patience.

46:35.804 --> 46:40.055
Nothing to get angry, nothing to get upset.

46:41.071 --> 46:43.193
And gradually, you will see,

46:43.393 --> 46:47.167
without telling people, they will discipline themselves.

46:48.706 --> 46:52.402
It is you have to discipline yourself.

46:54.879 --> 46:59.911
In the system of Sahaja Yoga,

47:00.112 --> 47:04.889
we never had so many disciples.

47:05.803 --> 47:11.762
Imagine till Shri Gnyaneshwara, there was only one disciple

47:11.963 --> 47:14.284
and some of them never had any disciple,

47:14.484 --> 47:17.884
like William Blake, I don’t think had any disciple.

47:19.324 --> 47:21.091
Perhaps, they must have thought

47:21.292 --> 47:23.904
that nobody can come up to this level or understand.

47:24.104 --> 47:28.163
So many of them had no disciple.

47:28.364 --> 47:30.987
Sai Nath had no disciple.

47:31.187 --> 47:34.251
They came on this Earth or maybe they might be thinking

47:34.451 --> 47:38.348
useless people, what’s the use of having disciples?

47:42.260 --> 47:48.199
But, for you, it’s so great that we are so many of us together now,

47:48.399 --> 47:52.982
so many. We understand each other. We know each other.

47:53.950 --> 48:01.524
We know all about kundalini

48:01.725 --> 48:05.246
and  we are so aware about everything.

48:05.961 --> 48:08.108
We know what’s happening in this world.

48:08.308 --> 48:11.714
We are not just sitting in a cave in Himalayas

48:11.915 --> 48:15.574
and just we are doing, taking the name of God. No.

48:15.774 --> 48:21.794
We are in the world. We are not running away from the world.

48:21.994 --> 48:24.489
We are in this world.

48:26.029 --> 48:34.131
We are facing every day,

48:35.403 --> 48:38.694
every problem that is there.

48:38.894 --> 48:44.741
But we are in reality and they are in ignorance.

48:45.802 --> 48:51.610
That’s why we know, we know the solution,

48:53.523 --> 48:58.213
we know the problem and we can solve it.

48:59.808 --> 49:03.471
Now, you have to just experiment with your powers,

49:03.671 --> 49:08.523
of course with humility that I have to warn some people.

49:08.723 --> 49:13.055
See, they just sit on the horse, immediately I say that.

49:13.722 --> 49:17.734
First of all, you must know that you are a store of knowledge,

49:17.935 --> 49:20.099
complete store of knowledge

49:22.805 --> 49:29.237
about everything, except for bank, I would say.

49:30.642 --> 49:33.839
That’s the problem for Me.

49:40.281 --> 49:48.269
So you should have projection

49:50.883 --> 49:54.567
towards that source of knowledge.

49:56.695 --> 50:02.400
For example, everything can be interpreted in the Sahaj language.

50:03.392 --> 50:08.031
Everything. You see this pandal.

50:08.340 --> 50:11.424
It’s standing there because supported by this

50:11.624 --> 50:17.543
– just like Sahaja Yoga. We are supported by our dharma.

50:17.744 --> 50:19.235
Very simple thing like that.

50:19.435 --> 50:21.965
Everywhere you’ll find

50:22.165 --> 50:27.652
the comparison of Sahaja Yoga with everything else that you see.

50:30.954 --> 50:37.118
This is very important. That will give a double joy.

50:43.656 --> 50:47.273
The other day I was coming back

50:48.233 --> 50:57.077
and in the airport, it was I was perspiring,

50:57.278 --> 51:00.405
perspiring absolutely.

51:00.635 --> 51:03.383
And the Sahaja Yogi who was with Me, he said, “Mother,

51:03.583 --> 51:08.060
You are sucking all the heat of this place, the negativity.”

51:08.260 --> 51:11.271
It was a fact. But only a Sahaja Yogi can see.

51:11.472 --> 51:15.251
Everybody was sitting nicely. I was the one fanning Myself.

51:15.451 --> 51:18.169
Everybody was so comfortable, feeling the cool from Me

51:18.370 --> 51:20.902
and I was fanning Myself.

51:24.163 --> 51:27.604
One day it happened, I was going to a shop,

51:27.805 --> 51:29.820
all the Australian Sahaja Yogi following Me,

51:30.020 --> 51:34.150
in a Chinese shop. I don’t know what these Chinese do.

51:34.484 --> 51:38.066
Climbing up was feeling so hot and exhausted.

51:38.266 --> 51:43.296
I was just trying to soothe Myself.

51:43.497 --> 51:46.280
And they’re saying, “Mother, such cool coming from you.”

51:46.481 --> 51:48.595
I said, “Very nice.”

51:53.346 --> 51:58.400
I’m the one consuming all the heat and giving you all the cool.

52:02.325 --> 52:06.845
But that is what My job is,

52:07.091 --> 52:10.514
to take all the heat from everyone

52:10.714 --> 52:16.753
and transform it into something cooling and soothing.

52:18.086 --> 52:22.959
When people shout, scream, this, that.

52:23.160 --> 52:27.612
Peaceful, be peaceful and listen to them

52:28.652 --> 52:34.402
and then you can pour water on them completely

52:34.602 --> 52:37.177
and the whole heat can go away.

52:37.377 --> 52:40.815
So this absorption is very important.

52:41.015 --> 52:43.621
Not to be afraid of absorption.

52:43.821 --> 52:48.585
But, for that, I would say one should take care

52:48.785 --> 52:51.831
and the care, as you know, is a very simple thing, this Kavacha,

52:52.031 --> 52:58.071
is this bandhan that you have to take.

52:59.754 --> 53:05.159
For all this, whatever I have said, there’s one guru mantra,

53:06.127 --> 53:10.777
to remember that we are Sahaja Yogis.

53:11.904 --> 53:17.735
Just remember this. We are Sahaja Yogis.

53:20.329 --> 53:28.333
And once you know you are Sahaja Yogis, this projection will start.

53:29.793 --> 53:33.087
What happened to William Blake? If you see,

53:33.287 --> 53:36.250
he started projecting his imagination

53:36.450 --> 53:40.850
and he reached the point of knowledge.

53:43.652 --> 53:48.491
So anything that you see, anything you do or others are doing,

53:48.691 --> 53:53.187
try to relate it with Sahaja Yoga and project.

53:55.051 --> 53:58.834
Then you will also reach the Ocean of Love.

53:59.034 --> 54:02.480
Once you have that, then what?

54:02.680 --> 54:05.294
Who can disturb you? Who can trouble you?

54:05.494 --> 54:08.138
Who can make anything that is difficult for you?

54:08.338 --> 54:11.313
Because you are sitting in the ocean, the fellow

54:11.513 --> 54:13.019
is sitting outside somewhere,

54:13.219 --> 54:16.286
how can it come into the ocean to trouble you?

54:18.382 --> 54:23.365
So this is what is to remember that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

54:23.928 --> 54:29.861
Take a bandhan morning and evening. It’s so simple.

54:30.061 --> 54:35.055
Even to say on the “my,” it seems stupid to Me.

54:35.255 --> 54:38.592
But, I have to say because people forget.

54:38.792 --> 54:41.240
You forget that you are realized souls.

54:41.440 --> 54:47.277
Use your vibratory awareness for at least protecting yourself

54:51.244 --> 54:54.516
because there is negativity sitting next to you.

54:54.716 --> 54:58.149
So be very careful about this, to remember that

54:58.349 --> 54:59.943
“I am a Sahaja Yogi.”

55:00.143 --> 55:02.954
Once you say that, you will know how you have to behave,

55:03.154 --> 55:04.589
what is the protocol,

55:04.789 --> 55:07.601
you will know what is the discipline you have to follow,

55:07.801 --> 55:11.741
you’ll know how to love others, everything.

55:14.463 --> 55:16.626
This is the essence.

55:19.475 --> 55:22.781
How many have been Sahaja Yogis before?

55:23.062 --> 55:25.479
Poor things, all these gurus suffered so much.

55:25.679 --> 55:27.686
You are not to suffer,

55:27.886 --> 55:34.060
not to go into any kind of a misery anymore, no more.

55:34.261 --> 55:38.204
But don’t forget you are Sahaja Yogis, that’s why.

55:38.616 --> 55:41.759
That will give you complete confidence in yourself and

55:41.959 --> 55:45.237
you’ll be absolutely secured.

55:46.609 --> 55:51.578
Try to establish the state that you are Sahaja Yogis.

55:51.778 --> 55:57.964
Thus, you become gurus of yourself and of others.

55:58.837 --> 56:00.667
May God bless you.
