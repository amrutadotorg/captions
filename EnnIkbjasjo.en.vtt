00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.060
Shri Guru Puja. Cabella Ligure (Italy), 04 July 1993.

00:00:03.373 --> 00:00:08.293
Today we are going to have Guru Puja.

00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:14.139
I’m supposed to be your guru,

00:00:16.813 --> 00:00:24.650
but I feel sometimes that the idea of a guru

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.180
is very different from Mine.

00:00:31.862 --> 00:00:37.382
Normally, a guru is a very, very strict person

00:00:37.946 --> 00:00:41.655
and has no patience of any kind.

00:00:43.457 --> 00:00:51.284
Even, say music, there are gurus who teach music in India,

00:00:53.681 --> 00:01:01.866
so all the disciplines have to be absolutely followed.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:08.447
I know about this great musician, Ravi Shankar.

00:01:10.106 --> 00:01:13.633
We had been to Maihar where he came

00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:20.868
and my father was very much respected by his guru, Allahudin Khan.

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:23.327
So he asked him, “Why don’t you play something.”

00:01:23.527 --> 00:01:25.506
So he didn’t tell him anything that time.

00:01:25.706 --> 00:01:31.333
Then he showed a big bump here. He said, “Sir, do you see this?”

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:35.233
He said, “What?” “My own tanpura,

00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:43.512
he broke on my head because I was little bit out of tune.”

00:01:45.227 --> 00:01:47.696
Otherwise, he was a very nice man, I must say.

00:01:47.897 --> 00:01:53.088
I knew Allahudin Khan sahab, but when it came to teaching,

00:01:56.262 --> 00:01:58.982
it’s a tradition I think

00:02:00.213 --> 00:02:07.807
that you have to put all kinds of disciplines on the students,

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:13.546
but still the students stick on to the guru.

00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:17.947
They look after all the time. They’re bothered with the guru.

00:02:18.148 --> 00:02:22.609
He wants this thing, they’ll run. If he wants this, they’ll do.

00:02:23.927 --> 00:02:31.948
A guru goes on taking different types of tests of the disciple.

00:02:32.924 --> 00:02:35.799
Like Shivaji’s guru asked him that

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:41.583
“I would like drink the milk of a tigress.”

00:02:43.338 --> 00:02:45.038
So he said, “All right.”

00:02:45.238 --> 00:02:48.755
If my guru has said it, it is his lookout.

00:02:49.074 --> 00:02:55.264
So went to the forest and he saw a tigress sitting there.

00:02:55.757 --> 00:03:00.086
She had already finished giving milk to her cubs,

00:03:00.286 --> 00:03:04.488
so he bowed before the tigress and he said,

00:03:05.028 --> 00:03:07.872
“See, my guru wants your milk.

00:03:08.325 --> 00:03:11.504
Will you please give some milk for my guru?”

00:03:11.704 --> 00:03:13.634
And the tigress understood it.

00:03:13.834 --> 00:03:19.750
She stood up and he took out the milk of the tigress for the guru.

00:03:20.091 --> 00:03:25.291
So, in this, one can see in the obedience of the guru,

00:03:25.696 --> 00:03:30.643
one achieves even the impossible things.

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:39.818
Another time his guru said that he has got a big boil on his leg

00:03:40.397 --> 00:03:46.183
and that it is all right and anybody who will suck it,

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.649
so has to be my disciple

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.207
and my disciple, when he sucks it, I will be all right.

00:03:54.407 --> 00:03:59.260
Everybody was so averse to a thing like that.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.391
Shivaji maharaj said, “Of course I will suck it.”

00:04:03.591 --> 00:04:06.181
He bend down. And he started sucking it

00:04:06.381 --> 00:04:12.520
from the bandage that was there and it was a mango.

00:04:14.813 --> 00:04:22.236
So there are two, three types of tests are all the time taken

00:04:23.942 --> 00:04:31.380
of the disciple. Firstly, how much they obey you.

00:04:35.407 --> 00:04:43.981
But, as you all have got Realization and you are your own gurus,

00:04:45.394 --> 00:04:50.252
I don’t put that condition on you.

00:04:52.538 --> 00:04:58.557
I leave it to your freedom. I tell you earnestly,

00:05:00.302 --> 00:05:05.767
in all the way possible, what I think good for you,

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:17.128
but I don’t compel like these gurus used to do.

00:05:17.328 --> 00:05:24.437
I mean, they used to beat. They used to hang them on the well.

00:05:27.123 --> 00:05:30.188
They were so very strict

00:05:30.388 --> 00:05:34.616
with their disciples and I’ve had an experience of this.

00:05:36.148 --> 00:05:40.980
They never used to smile. No question of laughing.

00:05:43.274 --> 00:05:49.463
And would never show any kind of weakness

00:05:49.663 --> 00:05:52.827
of kindness for the disciples.

00:05:54.185 --> 00:05:57.427
This is about the spiritual gurus I am telling you,

00:05:57.627 --> 00:06:04.186
but those who wanted their ascent, wanted their Realization

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:10.306
would go on passing through all kinds of tortures

00:06:10.527 --> 00:06:12.790
that they put on them.

00:06:14.544 --> 00:06:17.551
Some of the gurus who didn’t like some disciples,

00:06:18.297 --> 00:06:20.002
they would tell them, “All right,

00:06:20.202 --> 00:06:23.529
you now stand on your one leg all the time.”

00:06:24.523 --> 00:06:28.936
So they’re standing on one leg like a crane.

00:06:30.753 --> 00:06:37.293
Another one, they would say that “you stand on your head.”

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:50.115
The way they used to treat their disciples

00:06:52.052 --> 00:06:58.021
was rather difficult for Me. I can’t do it.

00:07:02.838 --> 00:07:09.343
All the time the compassion becomes the tears in My eyes.

00:07:09.544 --> 00:07:16.412
I find it impossible. I may just say it in a way,

00:07:16.768 --> 00:07:24.885
sometimes also, say it in a way that looks like little scolding,

00:07:25.925 --> 00:07:30.439
but to be a Mother and to be a guru is the most difficult thing.

00:07:36.002 --> 00:07:42.751
I do not know what comes first, but, of course, every mother wants

00:07:42.952 --> 00:07:49.274
her child to be good and the Holy Mother wants

00:07:49.475 --> 00:07:52.366
Her child to be a holy person.

00:07:54.421 --> 00:07:57.715
The first thing is the holiness.

00:07:58.358 --> 00:08:04.092
Now for that, how can you compel someone?

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:16.572
Only thing that makes you understand is this

00:08:18.659 --> 00:08:26.910
that if you don’t become holy, how will you get your ascent?

00:08:30.068 --> 00:08:32.116
We have to be holy.

00:08:34.228 --> 00:08:38.964
What discipline one can put for making a person holy?

00:08:41.361 --> 00:08:46.567
What can you force? What can you get angry for?

00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:55.274
Only method I use normally is to forgive.

00:08:58.202 --> 00:09:03.338
Maybe the forgiveness is the highest quality, I think,

00:09:03.539 --> 00:09:05.314
for teaching people.

00:09:08.898 --> 00:09:12.866
When they know that they have done wrong and they confess it,

00:09:13.067 --> 00:09:15.584
then you have to forgive.

00:09:17.552 --> 00:09:22.183
Like in the life of Buddha, there was a man

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:32.707
who was abusing him

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:37.692
without understanding

00:09:37.892 --> 00:09:44.800
and when he finished with his abuses and Buddha had left,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.044
people told him, “Do you know whom you were abusing?”

00:09:48.245 --> 00:09:53.206
It was Lord Buddha. Got a fright of his life.

00:09:54.214 --> 00:09:58.293
He said, “Where is he gone?” “He has gone to another village.”

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.735
So he went to another village and he said, “Sir,

00:10:01.936 --> 00:10:06.057
I am sorry for what I said. Please forgive me. It’s all wrong

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.846
and I should not have done it. You can punish me the way you like.”

00:10:17.021 --> 00:10:19.573
Lord Buddha said, “When did you do that?”

00:10:19.774 --> 00:10:23.473
He said, “Yesterday.” He said, “I don’t know yesterday.

00:10:23.673 --> 00:10:25.490
I know only today.”

00:10:29.109 --> 00:10:31.553
You see, even you tell these things,

00:10:31.754 --> 00:10:34.101
how great one feels, isn’t it?

00:10:34.887 --> 00:10:39.323
So your greatness, your nobility

00:10:41.421 --> 00:10:45.180
will definitely influence people.

00:10:45.919 --> 00:10:49.854
It’s not by fighting, by quarrelling,

00:10:50.054 --> 00:10:55.419
by saying harsh things it is going to work out.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:04.219
Also the gurus used to control the children very much,

00:11:04.482 --> 00:11:09.398
the disciples very much, absolutely control.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.280
You have to get up at four o’clock, sit down for meditation.

00:11:14.481 --> 00:11:17.839
If you have not got up, they would beat.

00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:23.314
I can’t understand. Sahaja

00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:29.251
Yoga is very different

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:40.335
from all other gurus that we believe in the power of love.

00:11:45.826 --> 00:11:50.934
Power of love teaches you how to be forgiving.

00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:55.878
It makes you noble.

00:11:58.735 --> 00:12:04.036
It makes you very balanced.

00:12:06.699 --> 00:12:11.276
So the gurus who were there for bhavasagara

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:19.177
to establish dharma in the human beings,

00:12:23.118 --> 00:12:26.514
first thing, they had to balance themselves

00:12:28.863 --> 00:12:35.913
against all practical things, as they call it.

00:12:37.493 --> 00:12:39.897
They think it is not practical,

00:12:41.547 --> 00:12:51.627
but they said, “No, for us, this is higher, nobler and important.”

00:12:53.727 --> 00:12:56.238
So they would balance people

00:12:56.439 --> 00:13:01.453
because they had this power of love within themselves.

00:13:02.977 --> 00:13:06.890
All these Adi Gurus and their incarnations, if you see them,

00:13:07.117 --> 00:13:15.830
they always had balance and always praised the love of God.

00:13:22.124 --> 00:13:32.267
When we talk about Realization, one has to know, first of all,

00:13:32.467 --> 00:13:36.155
that we have to have patience with ourselves.

00:13:38.108 --> 00:13:42.750
I know some people don’t feel so good,

00:13:43.932 --> 00:13:46.888
some people still have sicknesses.

00:13:47.373 --> 00:13:51.460
Some people don’t even feel vibrations sometimes.

00:13:53.408 --> 00:13:56.358
Have patience with yourself.

00:13:56.559 --> 00:13:59.186
When you become your own guru, first thing,

00:13:59.387 --> 00:14:05.436
as the guru has patience with his or her disciple,

00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:08.784
you must have patience with yourself.

00:14:13.439 --> 00:14:22.121
In that patience, you will learn that you can tolerate

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:26.797
so many things without any trouble.

00:14:29.122 --> 00:14:31.919
They say one person who goes on grudging,

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.229
“Oh, this is not good. That is not good”

00:14:40.689 --> 00:14:44.577
because they have no patience with themselves.

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:52.041
If you have patience with yourself, everything you’ll accept.

00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:57.128
Wherever you are, you are with yourself

00:14:57.328 --> 00:14:59.592
because you’re realized souls.

00:14:59.792 --> 00:15:05.518
So you won’t frustrate, you’ll not get angry

00:15:10.475 --> 00:15:14.721
and also you’ll not go on grumbling and grudging

00:15:15.412 --> 00:15:18.225
because you’re enjoying yourself.

00:15:19.646 --> 00:15:23.679
Even if there’s a mattress, all right.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.016
If there isn’t, you can sleep on the grass.

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.724
If there’s no grass, you can sleep on the stone.

00:15:28.924 --> 00:15:32.470
And also you need not sleep like last night,

00:15:34.795 --> 00:15:37.578
makes no difference whatsoever.

00:15:40.444 --> 00:15:42.234
The first thing I find with people,

00:15:42.472 --> 00:15:45.686
they have no patience with themselves.

00:15:47.344 --> 00:15:51.803
Firstly, maybe, because they’re conditioned.

00:15:52.003 --> 00:15:54.632
Say, if you have a left Vishuddhi,

00:15:54.832 --> 00:15:59.184
by any chance you have been a Catholic or T.M. or something,

00:16:00.882 --> 00:16:03.510
then all the time you start pitying yourself,

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:06.550
thinking no end of your miseries and troubles

00:16:06.750 --> 00:16:10.004
and always try to condemn yourself.

00:16:10.204 --> 00:16:12.287
You are a realized soul

00:16:12.748 --> 00:16:17.275
and you have no business to condemn yourself, no business.

00:16:23.124 --> 00:16:26.651
Like a person who’s getting drowned, has been saved,

00:16:26.851 --> 00:16:30.577
has come to the shore, now is doing nicely,

00:16:32.474 --> 00:16:35.049
has got his second life

00:16:35.517 --> 00:16:41.196
and there he’s still trying to express his agony,

00:16:41.396 --> 00:16:44.031
as if he’s getting drowned.

00:16:45.892 --> 00:16:50.301
So you have to awaken yourself. “No, no, no more I am there.

00:16:50.501 --> 00:16:55.869
I’m finished. It’s gone now. I am different.

00:16:56.488 --> 00:17:01.276
That was somebody else. I am not the same person.”

00:17:02.268 --> 00:17:06.977
This is how you have to tell yourself very clearly

00:17:07.177 --> 00:17:10.451
that “I am not going to condemn myself.”

00:17:15.197 --> 00:17:19.859
It was your right to get Self Realization. You got it.

00:17:23.136 --> 00:17:27.263
And then you cannot enjoy it because you have these conditionings,

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:32.300
especially in the West to be miserable, it is very fashionable.

00:17:35.133 --> 00:17:39.648
There are miseries of people who have no miseries.

00:17:52.215 --> 00:18:01.057
So, for such people who have imaginary miseries of the past,

00:18:01.257 --> 00:18:03.641
which do not exist in reality,

00:18:03.841 --> 00:18:08.099
they cannot have the joy of reality. They cannot.

00:18:10.821 --> 00:18:18.593
So, for a Sahaja Yogi, it’s important that he should have joy

00:18:25.887 --> 00:18:30.952
within his heart. It’s like an ocean.

00:18:32.118 --> 00:18:40.657
It’s like an ocean which is there all the time

00:18:44.566 --> 00:18:50.200
to give you such thrills.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:59.568
Even little drops of this ocean,

00:19:00.949 --> 00:19:07.400
when they trickle down in your being, it is so soothing.

00:19:08.694 --> 00:19:12.729
The experience can be only experienced.

00:19:16.015 --> 00:19:20.043
It’s all waiting within yourself.

00:19:28.304 --> 00:19:32.898
And such a person also makes others joyous.

00:19:35.382 --> 00:19:39.844
He cannot see another person unhappy, in trouble.

00:19:41.272 --> 00:19:49.308
Himself is full of joy and spreads joy all around.

00:19:50.494 --> 00:19:53.874
You can get joy from small, small things

00:19:54.716 --> 00:19:57.216
because you have the ocean

00:19:58.287 --> 00:20:00.477
and a little thing that drops into the ocean

00:20:00.677 --> 00:20:05.188
creates such beautiful ripples. They touch the shores,

00:20:07.283 --> 00:20:11.202
not only of your own being, but of others.

00:20:12.622 --> 00:20:19.175
Very, very small things make you so very happy

00:20:20.699 --> 00:20:22.950
and that all the time

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.843
you are just like a surfing, as they call it these days,

00:20:27.043 --> 00:20:32.142
on this beautiful lake or a beautiful ocean of love.

00:20:34.554 --> 00:20:39.460
Love is joy-giving. It’s not carnal love.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.014
It is Divine Love.

00:20:44.569 --> 00:20:51.147
So, as Sahaja Yogis and as gurus, we have to love ourselves

00:20:51.877 --> 00:20:54.165
and understand our own value.

00:20:54.365 --> 00:20:59.823
I think Sahaja Yogis have not yet understood their value.

00:21:00.024 --> 00:21:04.175
How many people in this world can give Realization?

00:21:07.918 --> 00:21:11.473
How many know about kundalini?

00:21:12.949 --> 00:21:20.061
How many have seen people being resurrected all the time?

00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:29.655
You are made so powerful

00:21:33.779 --> 00:21:37.767
that even looking at people, you can give Realization.

00:21:46.381 --> 00:21:50.486
In ordinary love, in carnal love people have fear.

00:21:52.351 --> 00:21:58.394
They’re afraid that their beloved might depart

00:21:58.595 --> 00:22:02.076
or might get sick, might happen this

00:22:05.044 --> 00:22:13.323
and they might all the time be under fear, resist enjoying.

00:22:16.141 --> 00:22:24.398
But, for you, you are with yourself and you are always protected.

00:22:30.087 --> 00:22:38.038
If your attention is bad for a second even,

00:22:38.238 --> 00:22:41.585
immediately you know you are going wrong.

00:22:41.785 --> 00:22:44.828
You protect yourself from yourself.

00:22:49.359 --> 00:22:54.153
As soon as you get some physical problem, you can feel it.

00:22:54.353 --> 00:22:57.006
You know how to cure yourself.

00:22:58.665 --> 00:23:02.092
But again, one has to have balance.

00:23:03.021 --> 00:23:06.072
If you’re off the balance,

00:23:06.707 --> 00:23:09.742
then you don’t even feel vibrations,

00:23:10.075 --> 00:23:14.040
you don’t even feel what’s wrong with you.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.591
You don’t know which direction you are moving,

00:23:17.791 --> 00:23:20.604
whether you are getting destroyed.

00:23:21.659 --> 00:23:27.442
And this balance has to be established by all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:38.226 --> 00:23:45.531
These imbalances come to us because we still think about our past

00:23:45.731 --> 00:23:47.996
or maybe about our future.

00:23:49.719 --> 00:23:52.064
We worry about these things.

00:23:54.492 --> 00:23:59.011
What is there to worry when all the angels and all the ganas

00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:01.102
are working for you?

00:24:02.896 --> 00:24:05.945
You just have to order, that’s all.

00:24:08.278 --> 00:24:12.799
But it’s like sometimes a person is made a king

00:24:12.999 --> 00:24:19.587
and is put on a throne, but before that he was a beggar,

00:24:19.787 --> 00:24:23.161
so anybody who comes to bow before him, he says,

00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:27.428
“All right. Give me one pound.”

00:24:31.273 --> 00:24:34.576
You have to know that you are all realized souls

00:24:34.776 --> 00:24:38.699
and that you have all the powers within you.

00:24:40.128 --> 00:24:44.307
Only thing which is very important is the balance.

00:24:45.585 --> 00:24:50.863
In Sahaja Yoga also people get into imbalances.

00:24:54.889 --> 00:25:03.794
How? Like I have seen people

00:25:06.036 --> 00:25:10.913
who are, say, afraid of these worldly laws.

00:25:14.926 --> 00:25:24.396
They don’t know there is such a powerful energy all around you.

00:25:28.749 --> 00:25:34.988
Nothing can stop you. Nothing can arrest you.

00:25:35.188 --> 00:25:37.568
Nothing can find faults.

00:25:37.768 --> 00:25:42.353
But when you start doubting, like yesterday’s doubting,

00:25:42.553 --> 00:25:45.517
when you say, “But, but.”

00:25:46.873 --> 00:25:52.799
When you start thinking about the man-made laws,

00:25:52.999 --> 00:25:55.574
then the God’s laws fail.

00:26:00.493 --> 00:26:03.511
Otherwise, nobody can punish you, nobody can arrest you,

00:26:03.711 --> 00:26:08.984
nobody can do anything to you. You are absolutely protected.

00:26:14.085 --> 00:26:22.012
So the main difference between the old style of guru

00:26:22.212 --> 00:26:26.058
and the modern style of guru is this

00:26:26.931 --> 00:26:31.801
that the old gurus used to you must suffer. All right,

00:26:32.002 --> 00:26:34.023
you have to be arrested is very good.

00:26:34.224 --> 00:26:37.219
If they give you poison, take the poison.

00:26:37.419 --> 00:26:40.318
If they want to slap you, take slaps.

00:26:40.518 --> 00:26:42.944
Whatever they want to do, you should accept

00:26:43.144 --> 00:26:45.422
because is your suffering.

00:26:45.622 --> 00:26:49.601
Not in Sahaja Yoga because your Mother is sitting here.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.736
How dare anybody touch you.

00:26:57.893 --> 00:27:02.773
No one can harm you. You have to believe Me when I say that.

00:27:03.456 --> 00:27:08.698
No one can harm you, but you must have that faith within yourself.

00:27:10.952 --> 00:27:14.875
Nobody had Adi Shakti as the Guru.

00:27:17.645 --> 00:27:21.617
Adi Shakti, the one who has all the powers of the world.

00:27:21.817 --> 00:27:27.535
So who can harm you? Who can torture you?

00:27:28.083 --> 00:27:30.083
Who can trouble you except for yourself?

00:27:30.283 --> 00:27:34.204
If you want to torture yourself, nobody can harm you.

00:27:37.092 --> 00:27:41.939
So the greatest difference between this disciple of other gurus

00:27:42.139 --> 00:27:46.158
and yourself is you don’t have to suffer.

00:27:49.106 --> 00:27:55.994
You are not to suffer and even, you see,

00:27:56.478 --> 00:27:59.316
if there’s somebody who has some negativity, that person,

00:27:59.517 --> 00:28:02.881
some Sahaja Yogis still carry on poor things they cannot help it

00:28:03.082 --> 00:28:06.074
they have been to wrong gurus or something.

00:28:06.384 --> 00:28:10.828
So they’ll meet with an accident,

00:28:11.408 --> 00:28:15.943
maybe they might face something terrible,

00:28:16.808 --> 00:28:20.221
but suddenly they’ll find they will get out of it.

00:28:20.421 --> 00:28:22.510
Maybe the negativity of somebody else,

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:27.665
some relations, some brothers, sisters or maybe of the nation.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.177
But you’ll get out of it.

00:28:38.169 --> 00:28:42.338
It is a very remarkable thing in Sahaja Yoga

00:28:42.538 --> 00:28:46.558
that there are people who catching.

00:28:47.327 --> 00:28:51.610
“Mother, my heart is catching. My this is catching. That is catching.”

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:56.512
But once they want to give Realization, just moves, kundalini moves.

00:28:57.496 --> 00:29:02.297
Whatever you may be, whatever may be your problems,

00:29:02.646 --> 00:29:05.848
but you raise your hand and kundalini moves.

00:29:06.713 --> 00:29:08.668
I mean, any instrument which is spoiled,

00:29:08.868 --> 00:29:11.470
say, supposing this fan is spoiled, it won’t work.

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:15.790
But not Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:15.991 --> 00:29:22.951
They work out, of course,

00:29:23.151 --> 00:29:27.541
if they don’t practice Sahaja Yoga

00:29:27.741 --> 00:29:30.818
or if they don’t give Realizations to others,

00:29:31.018 --> 00:29:35.172
then, of course, it can be a junk then.

00:29:36.774 --> 00:29:39.670
Supposing you don’t use your car, may be very good

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:43.013
and you don’t use it, it becomes a junk.

00:29:44.656 --> 00:29:49.243
So you have to give. You have to give Realization.

00:29:49.443 --> 00:29:52.522
All of you, whether it’s women or men.

00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:58.338
Whatever country you may belong, you have to give Realization,

00:29:58.538 --> 00:30:05.890
you have to allow this energy to go and work,

00:30:06.555 --> 00:30:12.884
otherwise it will suffocate.

00:30:14.233 --> 00:30:18.526
I’ve seen many Sahaja Yogis who have not done anything like that.

00:30:18.726 --> 00:30:22.347
They are very nice to you. Mother, we worship you at home.

00:30:22.547 --> 00:30:25.896
They suffer also from arthritis

00:30:28.781 --> 00:30:32.692
or other kinds of things,

00:30:33.723 --> 00:30:37.798
spondylitis’ sometimes they will have or

00:30:38.442 --> 00:30:42.370
they may have cellulitis or all kinds of things they can have.

00:30:42.973 --> 00:30:50.861
So you have to use your energy for giving Realizations to others.

00:30:54.186 --> 00:30:58.181
It’s all right, in protocol, if you don’t understand,

00:30:58.381 --> 00:31:00.086
you are forgiven.

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:06.006
Anything you might do out of innocence or ignorance is forgiven.

00:31:07.625 --> 00:31:11.505
But knowingly, if you want to do something,

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.311
then I don’t know repercussions

00:31:19.827 --> 00:31:24.694
because the area where you are is safe,

00:31:25.598 --> 00:31:29.419
but if you want to get out of that area,

00:31:31.769 --> 00:31:37.745
then all sides there are horrible negative forces working

00:31:37.945 --> 00:31:40.821
and you are captured into that.

00:31:41.782 --> 00:31:46.881
That’s not a mistake of Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:49.722 --> 00:31:55.430
To find faults with Sahaja Yogis or with Sahaja Yoga

00:31:55.883 --> 00:31:59.365
is another mistake we commit sometime.

00:32:00.967 --> 00:32:08.047
Say there are ten disciples with a guru, very good excellent guru,

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:13.921
if they complain about any one of them,

00:32:17.267 --> 00:32:21.991
immediately the guru will say, “You get out.”

00:32:28.543 --> 00:32:33.312
They have no business to complain about each other.

00:32:35.066 --> 00:32:38.502
On the contrary, like this hand is paining,

00:32:38.703 --> 00:32:41.324
then this hand doesn’t complain to the brain,

00:32:41.525 --> 00:32:43.657
but tries to soothe it.

00:32:48.468 --> 00:32:57.922
So Sahaja Yogis are gurus who belong to the collective.

00:32:59.834 --> 00:33:03.980
They move in a group, as described by Gnyaneshwara,

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:10.176
that you move now like the enlightened forest,

00:33:12.676 --> 00:33:18.917
which gives whatever people like, want to have, kalpatarus.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:30.727
And he said you move like oceans and talk about God.

00:33:31.264 --> 00:33:34.210
It’s not one single man standing and saying something.

00:33:34.411 --> 00:33:38.920
We saw yesterday in drama how a single man had to suffer.

00:33:41.286 --> 00:33:43.602
But you are in a group

00:33:45.721 --> 00:33:50.900
and all of you move in a group, together,

00:33:53.261 --> 00:33:55.519
with one understanding.

00:33:56.773 --> 00:33:59.666
Such a powerful group it is.

00:34:02.968 --> 00:34:08.669
They bring ambrosia to the people, according to Gnyaneshwara.

00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:17.254
But this power of collectivity that one feels

00:34:17.921 --> 00:34:20.964
is the first judgement of a person.

00:34:22.821 --> 00:34:30.878
Those who cannot be collective are not yet Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:34.624 --> 00:34:39.264
Some people think that they have served Me,

00:34:39.464 --> 00:34:44.281
they have looked after Me, they do My Puja or something,

00:34:44.968 --> 00:34:50.497
so that they have a right to scold others, to get angry with others,

00:34:50.697 --> 00:34:54.709
shout at them, tell them work, do all kinds of thing.

00:34:57.122 --> 00:34:58.799
It’s not so.

00:35:00.514 --> 00:35:04.305
You are a Sahaja Yogi when you are absolutely collective.

00:35:04.505 --> 00:35:09.454
Otherwise you are not a Sahaja Yogi when you are not collective.

00:35:11.469 --> 00:35:16.408
It’s so simple.

00:35:16.616 --> 00:35:22.386
That ego, the conditionings of ego

00:35:23.251 --> 00:35:30.932
or conditionings of the past may keep you away from others

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:35.193
and there is no connection to the Divine any more left.

00:35:35.393 --> 00:35:37.426
Those who are not collective people

00:35:37.626 --> 00:35:40.547
have no relationship with the Divine.

00:35:45.721 --> 00:35:50.504
You have understood now what is collectivity is.

00:35:50.705 --> 00:35:56.597
Most surprising thing is for Me that by giving Realizations to you,

00:35:56.797 --> 00:36:03.909
I find it very easy to talk about subtlest of subtle things to you.

00:36:06.114 --> 00:36:10.566
All these things I don’t think any guru could have talked.

00:36:11.367 --> 00:36:15.705
Not possible. It would not go into their heads.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:21.195
Very subtle, it is. You have become subtle

00:36:22.052 --> 00:36:27.888
and the subtleties have their own beauty in expression,

00:36:28.103 --> 00:36:32.581
in expression, in talking,

00:36:32.782 --> 00:36:37.417
in behaving with others, in understanding.

00:36:37.617 --> 00:36:40.899
It’s so sweet and so beautiful.

00:36:43.693 --> 00:36:53.434
The collective feeling is something like

00:36:53.634 --> 00:37:01.721
a little particle of clay thinks it is a mountain,

00:37:04.153 --> 00:37:07.181
like a drop becoming the ocean.

00:37:09.102 --> 00:37:12.551
But if there’s one drop who says, “No, no, no. I can’t be collective.

00:37:12.752 --> 00:37:15.114
I stay on the shore.” All right,

00:37:15.322 --> 00:37:17.847
the sunshine will evaporate.

00:37:20.395 --> 00:37:25.656
“But, Mother, I worship you. I do this. I do that.”

00:37:26.625 --> 00:37:29.099
With all that, if you do not develop collectivity,

00:37:29.299 --> 00:37:31.196
better not worship Me.

00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:40.739
For that, how a guru should act with the collective?

00:37:44.325 --> 00:37:47.956
In Sahaja Yoga nobody should feel

00:37:48.786 --> 00:37:53.353
that you are some hierarchy or a higher personality.

00:37:54.052 --> 00:37:57.467
If you start feeling like that, then at that point,

00:37:57.667 --> 00:38:01.126
you must know that there is some possession on you.

00:38:07.866 --> 00:38:09.805
What is the highest in the water? Nothing.

00:38:10.005 --> 00:38:13.332
Everything is just the same. It’s the way it is there.

00:38:13.532 --> 00:38:18.703
It has to be used for its own purposes.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:29.167
And the cruelties sometimes people indulge into is unimaginable.

00:38:35.617 --> 00:38:41.246
How can this kind of satisfaction

00:38:41.447 --> 00:38:47.025
be there if you are Sahaja Yogis?

00:38:48.235 --> 00:38:51.526
I don’t know. They say so, that gurus used to beat

00:38:51.726 --> 00:38:57.151
and they used to do all kinds of things. There must be bhoots. No.

00:38:58.882 --> 00:39:04.046
A very angry gurus. You cannot afford to be angry.

00:39:04.247 --> 00:39:08.931
Cannot afford. Anger means imbalance.

00:39:10.629 --> 00:39:14.004
You get attached to, say, your family,

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.438
start talking like that and no more.

00:39:22.657 --> 00:39:27.770
Attachment to anything shows you have no balance.

00:39:31.143 --> 00:39:35.915
Those who are balanced have to be detached.

00:39:39.399 --> 00:39:42.579
Otherwise you get attached to somebody.

00:39:42.779 --> 00:39:47.627
This is my daughter. This is my son. This is this.

00:39:47.827 --> 00:39:50.881
Then you don’t see the truth.

00:39:53.246 --> 00:39:55.888
So any kind of attachment,

00:39:59.738 --> 00:40:04.598
if you feel then know that you are not in balance.

00:40:07.288 --> 00:40:12.882
Also I’ve seen people get into a kind of a pride,

00:40:19.141 --> 00:40:22.010
pride that we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:25.752 --> 00:40:29.123
We have become Sahaja Yogis to save the whole world.

00:40:29.323 --> 00:40:32.420
It’s like I see so many government servants who think

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:36.922
no end of themselves. They’re servants of the people.

00:40:39.637 --> 00:40:44.240
They may be called officers, but officers to serve.

00:40:45.732 --> 00:40:49.388
In the same way, we are in this world to serve God

00:40:49.588 --> 00:40:53.807
and the purpose of your service is to save the world,

00:40:54.933 --> 00:40:56.791
save the people.

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:05.546
But if you have pride, false pride, how can you do that?

00:41:06.963 --> 00:41:12.141
The way you’ll talk, the way you’ll behave, nobody will come near.

00:41:18.925 --> 00:41:23.787
You cannot be jealous of another person, cannot be

00:41:29.574 --> 00:41:39.309
because jealousy means

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:44.836
that you are trying to harm yourself really.

00:41:45.036 --> 00:41:49.088
I don’t know what jealousy is so much.

00:41:49.493 --> 00:41:52.145
I see people getting jealous,

00:41:52.345 --> 00:41:56.633
but I don’t know what it is really, jealousy.

00:41:56.833 --> 00:41:59.504
The funny stuff, isn’t it?

00:42:03.329 --> 00:42:08.998
It must be coming from animal kingdom maybe, I don’t know,

00:42:10.474 --> 00:42:15.598
because what is there to be jealous. I mean, you are realized souls.

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:26.425
How can you be jealous of anyone?

00:42:26.625 --> 00:42:34.353
Say, supposing you are a diamond and another one is a diamond.

00:42:34.553 --> 00:42:39.703
Very good. Both put together will become even more brilliant.

00:42:41.894 --> 00:42:47.737
Now, supposing somebody is no good and you are very good,

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:54.299
then there is nothing to feel jealous of the man who is no good.

00:42:54.499 --> 00:43:01.217
Or also somebody who is good, to feel jealous, what is your gain?

00:43:02.082 --> 00:43:05.231
If you think that gentleman is good or that lady’s good,

00:43:05.431 --> 00:43:10.463
better try to follow what she is doing, how is she good,

00:43:10.663 --> 00:43:13.636
how she has got this goodness.

00:43:17.636 --> 00:43:19.858
It’s better to study.

00:43:21.898 --> 00:43:26.492
I really enjoy the most when Sahaja Yogis start

00:43:27.619 --> 00:43:31.531
expressing their feelings about other Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:34.642 --> 00:43:38.400
“Mother, he’s like that. Mother, he’s like that.”

00:43:40.416 --> 00:43:43.707
So, they see the goodness of others.

00:43:43.907 --> 00:43:48.084
They see the greatness of others, the nobility of others

00:43:48.284 --> 00:43:51.966
and when you start seeing that, you start becoming.

00:43:57.266 --> 00:44:02.083
If you feel jealous, I mean,

00:44:02.392 --> 00:44:05.609
I don’t know what sort of a thing it is, as I told you.

00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:09.379
But you are condemning yourself permanently.

00:44:09.579 --> 00:44:13.185
Today you are jealous of somebody because he has black hair.

00:44:13.385 --> 00:44:16.404
You are jealous of somebody because he has grey hair.

00:44:16.604 --> 00:44:20.050
You’re jealous of somebody because he has got a long nose,

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:24.070
jealous of somebody because he has got a short nose.

00:44:25.594 --> 00:44:28.344
[Shri Mataji speaks to a Sahaja Yogi:] What is happening?

00:44:28.545 --> 00:44:31.689
What happened? Ha?

00:44:36.971 --> 00:44:39.624
Are you a Sahaja Yogi?

00:44:39.824 --> 00:44:43.906
You are a Sahaja Yogi. Then you know the protocol. Let Me speak.

00:44:44.106 --> 00:44:46.434
All right? You can ask Me later on.

00:44:46.634 --> 00:44:50.501
This is not the way. This is not a parliament here.

00:44:50.701 --> 00:44:54.706
I know. I know that I don’t force any discipline,

00:44:54.907 --> 00:44:57.324
but this should be self discipline.

00:44:57.524 --> 00:45:00.449
You should be self-disciplined.

00:45:01.853 --> 00:45:04.387
I’m speaking just now. Listen to Me.

00:45:04.587 --> 00:45:08.797
Maybe I might answer you in My speech.

00:45:17.244 --> 00:45:26.458
So the relationship among yourselves

00:45:26.831 --> 00:45:33.117
cannot have anything to do with jealousy. Cannot.

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:37.941
Because it kills your joy.

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:53.711
Now, as I told you, that you get rid of your fear.

00:45:54.116 --> 00:45:56.952
You get rid of your jealousies.

00:45:57.190 --> 00:46:05.708
You get rid of your pride,

00:46:05.909 --> 00:46:08.304
false one.

00:46:08.505 --> 00:46:14.065
And also you get rid of your impatience.

00:46:17.291 --> 00:46:19.992
You must have patience.

00:46:20.192 --> 00:46:28.428
This is another style of guru

00:46:29.475 --> 00:46:33.501
who has patience, tremendous patience.

00:46:35.804 --> 00:46:40.055
Nothing to get angry, nothing to get upset.

00:46:41.071 --> 00:46:43.193
And gradually, you will see,

00:46:43.393 --> 00:46:47.167
without telling people, they will discipline themselves.

00:46:48.706 --> 00:46:52.402
It is you have to discipline yourself.

00:46:54.879 --> 00:46:59.911
In the system of Sahaja Yoga,

00:47:00.112 --> 00:47:04.889
we never had so many disciples.

00:47:05.803 --> 00:47:11.762
Imagine till Shri Gnyaneshwara, there was only one disciple

00:47:11.963 --> 00:47:14.284
and some of them never had any disciple,

00:47:14.484 --> 00:47:17.884
like William Blake, I don’t think had any disciple.

00:47:19.324 --> 00:47:21.091
Perhaps, they must have thought

00:47:21.292 --> 00:47:23.904
that nobody can come up to this level or understand.

00:47:24.104 --> 00:47:28.163
So many of them had no disciple.

00:47:28.364 --> 00:47:30.987
Sai Nath had no disciple.

00:47:31.187 --> 00:47:34.251
They came on this Earth or maybe they might be thinking

00:47:34.451 --> 00:47:38.348
useless people, what’s the use of having disciples?

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:48.199
But, for you, it’s so great that we are so many of us together now,

00:47:48.399 --> 00:47:52.982
so many. We understand each other. We know each other.

00:47:53.950 --> 00:48:01.524
We know all about kundalini

00:48:01.725 --> 00:48:05.246
and  we are so aware about everything.

00:48:05.961 --> 00:48:08.108
We know what’s happening in this world.

00:48:08.308 --> 00:48:11.714
We are not just sitting in a cave in Himalayas

00:48:11.915 --> 00:48:15.574
and just we are doing, taking the name of God. No.

00:48:15.774 --> 00:48:21.794
We are in the world. We are not running away from the world.

00:48:21.994 --> 00:48:24.489
We are in this world.

00:48:26.029 --> 00:48:34.131
We are facing every day,

00:48:35.403 --> 00:48:38.694
every problem that is there.

00:48:38.894 --> 00:48:44.741
But we are in reality and they are in ignorance.

00:48:45.802 --> 00:48:51.610
That’s why we know, we know the solution,

00:48:53.523 --> 00:48:58.213
we know the problem and we can solve it.

00:48:59.808 --> 00:49:03.471
Now, you have to just experiment with your powers,

00:49:03.671 --> 00:49:08.523
of course with humility that I have to warn some people.

00:49:08.723 --> 00:49:13.055
See, they just sit on the horse, immediately I say that.

00:49:13.722 --> 00:49:17.734
First of all, you must know that you are a store of knowledge,

00:49:17.935 --> 00:49:20.099
complete store of knowledge

00:49:22.805 --> 00:49:29.237
about everything, except for bank, I would say.

00:49:30.642 --> 00:49:33.839
That’s the problem for Me.

00:49:40.281 --> 00:49:48.269
So you should have projection

00:49:50.883 --> 00:49:54.567
towards that source of knowledge.

00:49:56.695 --> 00:50:02.400
For example, everything can be interpreted in the Sahaj language.

00:50:03.392 --> 00:50:08.031
Everything. You see this pandal.

00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:11.424
It’s standing there because supported by this

00:50:11.624 --> 00:50:17.543
– just like Sahaja Yoga. We are supported by our dharma.

00:50:17.744 --> 00:50:19.235
Very simple thing like that.

00:50:19.435 --> 00:50:21.965
Everywhere you’ll find

00:50:22.165 --> 00:50:27.652
the comparison of Sahaja Yoga with everything else that you see.

00:50:30.954 --> 00:50:37.118
This is very important. That will give a double joy.

00:50:43.656 --> 00:50:47.273
The other day I was coming back

00:50:48.233 --> 00:50:57.077
and in the airport, it was I was perspiring,

00:50:57.278 --> 00:51:00.405
perspiring absolutely.

00:51:00.635 --> 00:51:03.383
And the Sahaja Yogi who was with Me, he said, “Mother,

00:51:03.583 --> 00:51:08.060
You are sucking all the heat of this place, the negativity.”

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:11.271
It was a fact. But only a Sahaja Yogi can see.

00:51:11.472 --> 00:51:15.251
Everybody was sitting nicely. I was the one fanning Myself.

00:51:15.451 --> 00:51:18.169
Everybody was so comfortable, feeling the cool from Me

00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:20.902
and I was fanning Myself.

00:51:24.163 --> 00:51:27.604
One day it happened, I was going to a shop,

00:51:27.805 --> 00:51:29.820
all the Australian Sahaja Yogi following Me,

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:34.150
in a Chinese shop. I don’t know what these Chinese do.

00:51:34.484 --> 00:51:38.066
Climbing up was feeling so hot and exhausted.

00:51:38.266 --> 00:51:43.296
I was just trying to soothe Myself.

00:51:43.497 --> 00:51:46.280
And they’re saying, “Mother, such cool coming from you.”

00:51:46.481 --> 00:51:48.595
I said, “Very nice.”

00:51:53.346 --> 00:51:58.400
I’m the one consuming all the heat and giving you all the cool.

00:52:02.325 --> 00:52:06.845
But that is what My job is,

00:52:07.091 --> 00:52:10.514
to take all the heat from everyone

00:52:10.714 --> 00:52:16.753
and transform it into something cooling and soothing.

00:52:18.086 --> 00:52:22.959
When people shout, scream, this, that.

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:27.612
Peaceful, be peaceful and listen to them

00:52:28.652 --> 00:52:34.402
and then you can pour water on them completely

00:52:34.602 --> 00:52:37.177
and the whole heat can go away.

00:52:37.377 --> 00:52:40.815
So this absorption is very important.

00:52:41.015 --> 00:52:43.621
Not to be afraid of absorption.

00:52:43.821 --> 00:52:48.585
But, for that, I would say one should take care

00:52:48.785 --> 00:52:51.831
and the care, as you know, is a very simple thing, this Kavacha,

00:52:52.031 --> 00:52:58.071
is this bandhan that you have to take.

00:52:59.754 --> 00:53:05.159
For all this, whatever I have said, there’s one guru mantra,

00:53:06.127 --> 00:53:10.777
to remember that we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:53:11.904 --> 00:53:17.735
Just remember this. We are Sahaja Yogis.

00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:28.333
And once you know you are Sahaja Yogis, this projection will start.

00:53:29.793 --> 00:53:33.087
What happened to William Blake? If you see,

00:53:33.287 --> 00:53:36.250
he started projecting his imagination

00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:40.850
and he reached the point of knowledge.

00:53:43.652 --> 00:53:48.491
So anything that you see, anything you do or others are doing,

00:53:48.691 --> 00:53:53.187
try to relate it with Sahaja Yoga and project.

00:53:55.051 --> 00:53:58.834
Then you will also reach the Ocean of Love.

00:53:59.034 --> 00:54:02.480
Once you have that, then what?

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:05.294
Who can disturb you? Who can trouble you?

00:54:05.494 --> 00:54:08.138
Who can make anything that is difficult for you?

00:54:08.338 --> 00:54:11.313
Because you are sitting in the ocean, the fellow

00:54:11.513 --> 00:54:13.019
is sitting outside somewhere,

00:54:13.219 --> 00:54:16.286
how can it come into the ocean to trouble you?

00:54:18.382 --> 00:54:23.365
So this is what is to remember that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:54:23.928 --> 00:54:29.861
Take a bandhan morning and evening. It’s so simple.

00:54:30.061 --> 00:54:35.055
Even to say on the “my,” it seems stupid to Me.

00:54:35.255 --> 00:54:38.592
But, I have to say because people forget.

00:54:38.792 --> 00:54:41.240
You forget that you are realized souls.

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:47.277
Use your vibratory awareness for at least protecting yourself

00:54:51.244 --> 00:54:54.516
because there is negativity sitting next to you.

00:54:54.716 --> 00:54:58.149
So be very careful about this, to remember that

00:54:58.349 --> 00:54:59.943
“I am a Sahaja Yogi.”

00:55:00.143 --> 00:55:02.954
Once you say that, you will know how you have to behave,

00:55:03.154 --> 00:55:04.589
what is the protocol,

00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:07.601
you will know what is the discipline you have to follow,

00:55:07.801 --> 00:55:11.741
you’ll know how to love others, everything.

00:55:14.463 --> 00:55:16.626
This is the essence.

00:55:19.475 --> 00:55:22.781
How many have been Sahaja Yogis before?

00:55:23.062 --> 00:55:25.479
Poor things, all these gurus suffered so much.

00:55:25.679 --> 00:55:27.686
You are not to suffer,

00:55:27.886 --> 00:55:34.060
not to go into any kind of a misery anymore, no more.

00:55:34.261 --> 00:55:38.204
But don’t forget you are Sahaja Yogis, that’s why.

00:55:38.616 --> 00:55:41.759
That will give you complete confidence in yourself and

00:55:41.959 --> 00:55:45.237
you’ll be absolutely secured.

00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:51.578
Try to establish the state that you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:55:51.778 --> 00:55:57.964
Thus, you become gurus of yourself and of others.

00:55:58.837 --> 00:56:00.667
May God bless you.
