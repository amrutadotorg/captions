00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Mother, if you would like to say just a few words to take in.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Just give it.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Again, I'm back here in Moscow.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Where the people are great seekers of Truth.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And absolutely ready to achieve their self-realization.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Which is the goal of our human life.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
As Christ has said that we are to be born again,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
it happens.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.800
Yoga is no religion.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.810
It is the union with All-pervading Divine Love.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.488
That is the right of every person.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.798
Every human being.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Here now we have people from Finland, from England, from Germany,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
from Austria who have come to help my work in Russia.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.748
They are all your brothers and sisters.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Hope to see you this evening, all of you, for the program.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
All right.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Thank you.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Thank you very much.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Thank you, my love.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Thank you very much.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Thank you.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Thank you, Mother.
