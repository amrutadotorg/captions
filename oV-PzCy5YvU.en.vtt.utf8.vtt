00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.920
Will You sit down Mother or stand up?

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.060
- Have you finished or not?
- Yes, Mother.
- Please continue.
-  No, no they're very anxiously waiting for You, Mother.
- Oh, I see. Huh

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.640
They all see and I'll get up and talk.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.360
I'll stand up.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.820
Please be seated.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.640
[UNCLEAR - ARE THEY ALRIGHT?]

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.320
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.080
We came on this earth without knowing why are we here

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.220
and when we grew up we felt, we are here for various things

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:24.760
to enjoy our physical being, our mental being, our material side,

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.440
our powers, our possessions, our friendships

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.760
and our limited love. We worked very hard with it

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.760
to achieve some sort of a joy out of all that.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.320
But the other day I was watching one film very funny and a very - [UNCLEAR - SHE'D] a grotesque type of a film it was

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.040
lot of hard truths were there - showing a man trying to

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:08.060
achieve some goal of marrying a particular lady, for that trying to get some money.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.220
The picture was presented in a very, I should say, in a very, very

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.820
violent way which was really repulsive to My mind but

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.180
it proved that all these pursuits are good for nothing.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.620
They lead you nowhere, you're left high and dry as you were - much worse than what you,

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:42.900
you were born. Your innocence is lost, your sense of love is lost,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.600
your value system is lost and you are absolutely

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.860
in a , in a position that you see that life has been worth nothing.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.800
Some people, of course, take help from limited understanding,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.660
"Oh, I have four children, I have insurance for them, I have to look after them,"

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.440
or some people think that they have written few books and these books will be good for others

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.360
or they have done some painting so it will help others and it will be a nice thing.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:29.380
But as Shakespeare has very beautifully and delicately always suggested that the life is futile.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.320
All such people who show that, we call them avadhuta, is the kind of a prophet

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.800
who shows that the whole thing is futile - that is very important.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.600
Unless and until it is shown that all such pursuits are futile, people don't take to something higher - they're not aware of it.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.800
Is better to tell them beforehand that all such pursuits are futile. [ASIDE - PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR]

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.440
Now the trouble is that we reach partly

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:10.980
to that conclusion many a times in our life, we reach that conclusion sometimes totally also - so what?

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:20.080
We start thinking - then why am I here, why God has created me from amoeba stage to this stage?

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.900
What was the need for Him to bother so much, if He existed?

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.980
To create me into a human-being and then make my life miserable and then I die -

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:39.620
many people must be asking this question to God who Himself is an imagination for many.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.640
So we come to a proper, logical end, logical understanding, conclusion

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.700
that there must be some purpose to this life,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:02.660
there must be some meaning to this life and that's what exactly you have to know

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.700
that you have a very, very great purpose. The greatest purpose is that

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.180
God Almighty who has created you - you may believe in him or you may not believe in Him but He exists.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:24.620
He exists and He loves you and He loves you very much - has created this universe only for you to come on the stage.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.660
He has created this beautiful world that you people as human-beings seeking Him,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:38.840
will come up to this point that ultimately you are at the threshold of His Kingdom.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:46.260
And then something little has to happen to you so that you jump into that new awareness

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:54.440
which is the awareness of the Kingdom of God. It is not at all difficult

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:01.840
if you understand one point, that so far we have become human-beings

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:09.740
without going into any turmoil or without going into any effort. So if you have to achieve a higher state,

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:17.300
what effort can we put in? I had a big discussion with a television gentleman the other day,

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:24.260
who was saying all the time that, "Mother, how can it be instant?" I said, "Then tell Me how many hours it should take,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:32.880
how many minutes it should take?" Because if it has to happen beyond the time there cannot be any time limit to it as Nature is.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:39.060
In the nature you find that a flower

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:47.180
becomes a fruit - no one sees is becoming. It is so minutely working out nobody sees.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:54.820
it just works out automatically, spontaneously and how much time, you cannot say.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:01.380
You cannot definitely say that at this time this flower is going to get transformed,

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:08.480
nor can you say that it will be a complete fruit by this time because all living things are done beyond time.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:15.280
They have no relationship with time but they have relationship with the moods

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:22.880
but not with the time. For example, the Mother Earth is in good mood, She's very happy -

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:30.140
I mean, when human-beings are nice, She has to be happy - and when She produces beautiful

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:38.860
seasons, everything works out smoothly. But She's angry, annoyed

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:45.540
and She creates earthquakes, all kinds of problems, then

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:53.640
no seasons - it's her mood. If She creates anything great,

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:58.760
She creates or else it is Her mood, She can create a big, vast

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:08.360
ocean or a huge, big sandstorm

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.920
or could be anything that you can call as

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.580
a mountain or a river or whatever way She whatever way she wants to do.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.900
It's Her, it's her whim. Can you ask the Mother Earth, "Why did you put Himalayas there?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.120
Why was this river Ganges is flowing in India?"

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.740
We never ask Her. "How much time did You take to make it?

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:42.540
What was the time limit for You to create it?" You cannot put all these things to Her, She does it the way She wants to do it.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.560
If she wants, She can create deserts after deserts, so

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:56.200
we, the ones who have these watches in our hands, must know that She doesn't go by our watch.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:05.240
We have to set our watch according to Her watch which is a very difficult thing and that's why we are in trouble

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.720
because we cannot set our programs with the programs of the Divine. She works according

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:19.660
to the Divine nature of Her being and that's how we find that when we try to excavate too much out of Earth,

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:24.900
use Her too much, make Her completely barren, then She reacts

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:32.300
and Her reactions come in, in so many ways that the atmosphere is spoilt, you can't exist in such a place

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.520
you have to leave that place because of pollution - it's such a nice

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:42.760
integration with other elements also that people have to leave that place and they cannot do more excavations.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:51.240
All this happens, not only with Mother Earth, with all the elements. It is their mood

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:57.400
that works out everything and when their moods are spoilt

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:05.120
they can do any havoc they want to - people cannot explain why a particular time

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.660
lightning hit some place, what was the purpose of lightning?

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:16.040
Why it rained so heavily at such a particular point? Because we are not tuned

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:24.280
with the Kingdom of God, His laws, His methods, which are tuned with the Divine beings of all the

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:30.760
elements. Now it is hard to believe what I'm saying because people might think how does Mother know?

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:39.100
That's another question, you see, as everybody has a right to ask Me but I would say that it is better that you also know as I know,

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:47.260
which is very easy, and also that to know something is not by your brain.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:54.520
For this, your brain is not sufficient to answer these questions, for this you have to become something more than the brain,

00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:02.160
more than this limited time, more than this limited brain, more than this logic

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:09.760
that you think you can find out everything through your logic - you cannot. And this is what has to happen to us.

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:15.120
First of all we must understand that we are very limited as human-beings.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:21.200
In our ego we might think, "Oh, we have done this, we have done that, we have built this nice building, see how beautiful it is!"

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:28.180
But what have you done? Something was dead, you converted into another dead.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.480
The One who transforms the flowers into fruits

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:41.360
could, does all kinds of living things, according to One's mood.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:51.780
How can you understand Him with this dead, limited brain - how can you understand Him?

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:57.320
So there's something has to happen to us that we should go beyond time and

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:04.460
beyond this limited brain to achieve it. Now one may say that, "For this what should we do?"

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:12.520
We have to do nothing, as we have done nothing. From animals to this stage we have come without doing anything.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:18.200
There is nothing to feel bad that you can do something without doing anything.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:22.800
Actually we are doing so many things without doing anything - we're breathing

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:32.660
we are, our heart is beating - everything is happening automatically

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:37.700
and we're existing like that without doing anything.

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.140
So when we are doing something without doing anything

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:49.000
- the evolution that has taken place has taken place without doing anything and if you have to go higher,

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:56.040
we must accept with all humility, that it will be done because we are built-in that way.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:00.320
Like a little seed has all the future trees

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.880
embedded in it, in the same way, all our future is embedded within us.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:14.780
That's how we have come today to this state in a special way, as you see here, what we have been

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:21.760
from Carbon we rose, supposing - Carbon is at this red spot and then gradually we started moving upward.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.040
At the yellow stage the

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.660
ether was created or Antriksha was created and all the stars -

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:38.680
- Can you bring it further here for everybody to see?
- Would You like to stand here?
- Alright
- No, I would say that one
- Yes.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.900
If you could bring it there, everybody can see it better

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:49.380
and I hide it. With the second one

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:58.600
all the Nature, all that you see in matter was created.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:06.000
By the third one, which we call as the Nabhi chakra,

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:14.480
everything was sorted out at a very gross level.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:21.340
As you know in Chemistry, that all the elements are put into a proper periodic law

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:28.540
and in that periodic law, this period is for, say,  Carbon, this is for Hydrogen - like that there are

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:36.860
eight classifications, at a very gross level so, they were given different valencies.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:42.760
Ultimately at human level also, you were given ten valencies.

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:50.240
As you know, in the matter there are only eight valencies and in the

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:59.320
animals there are nine valencies but in the man, human-beings only, there are ten valencies which are

00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:06.040
told to us in a very gross manner - because, I think, that time human-beings were extremely gross - as ten commandments.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.840
But people listened and obeyed those days without questioning but when they questioned

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:18.280
in these modern times, better to tell them in a very subtler way, that these are eight valencies within us

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:26.180
which actually make us as human-beings and when we disobey those valencies, then we go

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.640
either to the left or to the right and we become either sub-normal or abnormal.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.600
To be normal we have to have those eight valencies within us.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:44.180
But why these valencies were created, is another question which I will tell you later.

00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:47.320
Then the another center was created -

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:53.160
the center, this one, came at the time when people started feeling the fear -

00:16:54.420 --> 00:17:00.040
fear of animals, fear of nature, fear of something unknown -

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:06.840
a protection was to be built-in and for that protection a deity

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:15.240
is created and this deity is the deity of our protection and that's how this center was created.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:21.860
In human-beings it acts first at twelve years of age in the sternum bone when

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:31.600
the anti-bodies are created and these anti-bodies start getting distributed completely to the whole body

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:37.060
but is the sternum bone which gives the message to the anti-bodies when they have to fight.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:43.140
So, an army was created within us to fight all that is invading us.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:51.220
Then we have the higher center than that, is the center what we call of the center of Vishuddhi - is the center where

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:57.940
human-beings raise their head up from animal stage to this stage

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:07.080
when they raise their head, then this center became a perfect center in the sense it developed sixteen petals.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:14.520
We take our face for granted, we take everything like our eyes, nose, ears, everything for granted.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:22.080
All this was created in a very special way because we raised our head up and we became human-beings.

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:30.360
But as soon as we raised our head, a complication started building-up within ourselves and that complication was when,

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:39.400
I would say, Adam and Eve raised their head and wanted to find out what is this knowledge.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:47.020
That is the time when we first made a big mistake - if we had not made mistakes at that time,

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:54.720
I think, the realization would have been achieved thousands of years back. What ever it is, the mistake is made so

00:18:55.180 --> 00:19:00.660
God has forgiven us and He thought that He should try to help you to come out of it,

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.860
out of the mistake and achieve your realization.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:12.240
Because of this center you build, started building up two institutions within yourself, called the ego and super-ego.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.880
Somebody said to you something, you get conditioned and you get your super-ego and somebody uh...

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:27.360
says, challenges your ego and you develop

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:33.720
your ego or when you talk to others in an aggressive way also you develop your ego.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:42.280
Also these two, two other channels that you see left and right, are the channels which are

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:50.280
within us working on the left-hand side, the power of desire and on the right-hand side the power of action.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.640
As a result of that, we develop from the left side, the power

00:19:54.860 --> 00:20:02.840
of super-ego you can call it or we can say the myth of super-ego and on the right-hand side the, the temper of ego.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:10.060
That's how both of these things join and we develop a personality which has it's I-ness

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:15.580
like I become so and so, you become so and so, another person becomes so and so.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:21.360
This I-ness develops, gradually we start identifying ourselves because of this I-ness with

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:29.460
other things like, "I am British, I am Indian, uh.. I am this caste, this community, this race,

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:36.580
this country, " all those identifications starts coming in our head and we start building up our personality

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:41.960
much more strongly separated, alienated from the rest of it.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:51.060
So our collectivity, the oneness with the whole,

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:56.000
is lost - we become a separate entity.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:04.240
By this center we become a human-being, I should say, and then another center is built-up here.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:09.340
On this center a deity, which we know as Lord Jesus Christ, came on this earth.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:17.080
Because He thought that these two, two institutions are very heavy in human-beings - the ego and superego -

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:23.120
and unless and until these two institutions are, somehow or the other, sucked in

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:31.600
there is no possibility of an ascent and so this great deity came on this earth to suffer for us and

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:40.220
to create a position there. Now if this deity can be awakened, then it sucks in

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:47.760
those problems of ego and superego and that's how we get opened to the Kingdom of God.

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:53.620
Ultimately, we pierce through this Kingdom of God from here and we become the Self,

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.880
[UNCLEAR - LIZE IF OR AS IF?] we enter into the

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:03.380
chamber of God Almighty, you can say or into his court where

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:11.200
after the kingdom you enter into His court by piercing through this and you get the powers that a citizen has to get

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:17.180
from His Kingdom. Now what should be done

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:23.900
to again enlighten those deities which are within you.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:32.160
Something had to be do, done and that is what is within us the triangular bone, in the triangular bone

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:38.440
you find the Kundalini. This Kundalini is nothing else but the reflection of the Holy Ghost.

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:44.180
In the Bible there isn't much written about Holy Ghost and people really don't know because I asked a priest

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:51.080
and he says, "I'm a agnostic, I don't know." If he's agnostic, why, what is he doing there? He says, "I'm doing my job."

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:59.820
So I mean, what job can you do when you don't know about the thing like a professor in Cambridge university doesn't know what is Physics and what is he doing his job, how can he do it?

00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:07.280
You have to know about your uh..what you're professing. So they don't know anything about Holy ghost and this Holy Ghost

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:13.940
is reflected within us as the Kundalini and this Kundalini has to rise,

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:21.060
pass through these centers, awaken all these deities, awaken Christ by which to suck in these

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:27.640
two problems within us, open out the gate and then we enter into the Kingdom

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:33.200
of God and then ultimately we enter into the court of

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:41.060
God Almighty. This is how the whole story was built-up and that's how we have to get our realization.

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:46.540
But it takes hardly any time. It is called in Sanskrit 'tatshand'

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:51.420
means the same moment - there's not a split of a second also in between - tatshand,

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.240
immediately it does. Like if you put the seed in a,

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:05.580
in the Mother Earth's uh.. care, in Her warmth, immediately it starts sprouting -

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:11.700
you can't say when it started. If it is wet, immediately it starts

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:19.100
sprouting so, if there is somebody like that which we call the 'Sandrakarudna',  the one who has got

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.820
that moisture and that compassion of the Mother Earth

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:32.680
that person can instantly raise the Kundalini, is all described in the, in the Scriptures in India and many others

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.460
but the problem is that Bible being a very microscopic book

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:46.520
cannot contain everything that is knowledge nor can it contain a person like Christ.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:52.800
You have to go to other books to find out what Christ was, how He came on Earth, what was His background -

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:01.180
you cannot just say that, "I believe in Christ and I go to church so I have the selected one - Christ will catch my hand and will take me to Heaven."

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:09.820
Is a wrong idea people have and if you live with that idea, I'm sure, a day will come when you will have to repent.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:18.160
Christ Himself has said that, "You are to be born again, " and when Nichadamas asked Him, "What do You mean, have I to enter into the womb of my mother?"

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:26.040
He clearly said that, "No, whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh, " but I'm saying, you're to be born of the Holy Ghost and this is the Holy Ghost

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:33.780
that is to give you your re-birth, this is the Holy Ghost which is your mother - everybody has an individual mother -

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:40.300
and She's just waiting for this moment to give you Self-realization and that's how you get your Self-realization.

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:47.500
What we call is baptism, is the same as Self-realization but it has to be a true thing. As in India also many people

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:53.980
uh... at the age of eight or ten years of the boy, uh.. they say, "He's become a Brahmin now," they give him a thread and all that

00:25:54.240 --> 00:26:00.960
but it's just a ritual just like baptism - is artificial. Actually, to call yourself a Brahmin, you have to be a realized soul.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:07.980
Brahmin is the one who knows Brahm, the one who can feel All-Pervading power and that's what should happen to all of us

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:15.980
when we get our realization. Now, many people say, "Oh I'm a Self-realized person, I'm twice born," - this is self certificate.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:22.740
When you get Self-realized first of all, your life is a transformed life - you become virtuous,

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:30.480
you become righteous - nobody has to tell you, just automatically. You just become that. You become a powerful, compassionate personality.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:36.220
And you become like a witness - you start watching the whole world without feeling the pressures or anything.

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:41.120
This atleast minimum should happen to a person who says is a Self-realized person.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:47.600
But I've seen the other day, those people who call themselves twice born, came with a Bible to hit Me and I was just laughing I couldn't

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:55.300
I mean, the joke was so big that for Me, I just never felt angry or anything - I just started laughing that they should come and hit Me with a Bible.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:02.440
So this is what it is. One must know that when you're transformed, the whole life pattern changes - we become innocent.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:09.020
As Christ has said, "Thou shalt have adulterous, thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.200
How many Christians there are who have no adulterous eyes?

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:18.200
Is there innocence by going to church, does even the priests, I don't know,  if they have uh.. got clean eyes?

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:23.500
So when do you become that is to be seen, to be

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:30.140
understood, to be experienced, to be truthful, to be honest to yourself - you must know that, "No thus innocence has not come to me."

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:36.740
And this innocence comes when the Kundalini passes through your Agnya chakra here, then She cleanses your eyes,

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:41.940
cleansing takes place and you become innocent so much so that you put your eyes on somebody

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:48.920
or you just look at somebody, in Sanskrit there is 'Kataksh, kataksh nirikshand' - if you look at somebody, that person feels nice.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:57.180
If you just put attention to somebody, that person feels nice and this should happen to all of you. If it cannot happen, then what,

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:04.420
what is the use of saying that, "I've got Self-realization," and appointing yourself as gurus and making money out of that?

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:13.700
Another thing which was surprising, the gentleman argued with Me that I'm not making any money. I said, "How much will you pay Me, first of all?"

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:19.420
The second question is, "How much did you pay to Christ?" - Did you?

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:28.200
You have such a great personality before you, like Christ. I mean, He is the essence of all the personalities and what are we doing about it?

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:34.200
'Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes' - that's missing and we're paying money for our

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:40.400
gurus, we're paying money for our seeking - how much did we pay Christ?

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:47.780
and he didn't see, shut up, he didn't answer anything. And this is a fact that you cannot pay for it,

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:53.760
you just cannot pay for it. He said, "This Anglo-Saxon brain won't understand unless and until You make them pay."

00:28:54.080 --> 00:29:01.080
I said, "It is too invaluable and if the Anglo-Saxon brain doesn't understand, I do not want to convince them

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:09.540
by taking money from them." It is devaluation of the whole thing, is something so nonsensical

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:14.260
that it is absolutely absurd and such a nonsense I will not tolerate

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.280
whether it is Anglo-Saxon or Saxon-Anglo - makes no difference to Me.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.920
So these brains have to come round and understand that Divine cannot be purchased at any cost.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:34.600
You may think too much of your money but you cannot purchase your Divinity in the market - it is not for sale in the market.

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:42.700
And please understand this. I know there are some people who have come here, have been to other gurus and some of them are identified also with those gurus

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:48.660
and sometimes they come and fight with Me but why do you want to fight with Me, why not fight with those who have cheated you,

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:55.520
who have taken money from  you, build their empires, uh.. bought Rolls Royces, why don't you go and fight with them

00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:01.700
where you headlong you went down and did it. Only good point is that you're free before Me

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:09.920
you have your own ideas - that's a very good substantial thing that encourages Me no doubt but try to understand

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:17.840
that you are fighting in a wrong place. Where you had to fight, where you had to judge, where you had to know, you made mistakes

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:23.400
and where you cannot judge, where there is nothing to be judged,

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.740
you are putting your noses too much into it.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:34.500
And this is the problem with the brain is, that it doesn't know what is right and what is wrong; For that you must get your realization.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:42.540
So, in sahaja yoga what I have thought of is this way that let them have their light first, let be they awakened - all of them should be awakened.

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:50.360
Let them have their light because they're all light, they're all Spirit, they're all glory. Let them feel that glory, that peace, that bliss within themselves,

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:55.220
then gradually in that light they will see what sort of a lamp I have got.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:02.220
and then they become their own gurus and correct themselves - I don't have to tell them. It is they who look after themselves by understanding

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:09.160
and this is the best method has worked out because I can tell you this much, never in this world on

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:18.380
any time there were so many realized souls. Today in this Cambridge to see so many realized souls sitting

00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:25.900
I feel very heartened. I remember the first time I had come ah.. some missionaries, you see, they arranged a program for Me

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:31.780
with some very old people who could not hear Me nor could see Me. I was amazed at their greatness, you see,

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:38.840
what am I to do with them and they said, "You just heal them," I said, "For what?" What's the use of

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:45.100
healing people who are not going to give light? Any, any light which is out of uh.. order

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:52.820
and which never will be in order, you don't want to give the light but still out of compassion I did it for them whatever was possible.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:58.520
But they are useless because they are themselves on the way - one foot in the grave, one foot outside, you see,

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:03.880
I may save them for a while but they are going to die and what are they going to help? It's you people

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:12.180
who are on this earth, now responsible for this, have to come up and see that it is your duty

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:18.580
that at this great moment, at this resurrection time, at this judgment time, you are born with a purpose

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:25.140
otherwise you could have born at the time uh.. when the people were busy fighting Napoleon -

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:32.100
no, you are born at this time when you have to fight the ignorance of the people, at such a special time of resurrection,

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:37.420
about which Mohammad sahab has said that, "Your hands will speak."

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:43.640
He's talked of resurrection much, much more than he has talked of doomsday but

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:49.460
Muslims don't want to talk of resurrection, they want to talk of doomsday because they can frighten people to get some money out of them.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:56.180
Same with Christianity - Christ has said that this will happen that, you will get

00:32:57.540 --> 00:33:04.040
your realization that Christ will be born within you and all these things have been already revealed to you.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:09.820
Even a great poet like William Blake has said that, "Those days when

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:17.500
there will be resurrection time, men of God will become prophets

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:24.880
and they will have powers to make others prophets." All those scriptures are to be proved today, everything has to be proved today

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:32.380
and that is only possible if you become the light yourself otherwise in the darkness what's the use of proving

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:38.160
that this is red or this is black? Makes no difference to a person who has not seen the light.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:45.380
And that is why, I have to make a very humble request to you, that you first get your realization - that is the best way

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:49.980
you can understand yourself and others. May God bless you!

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:55.960
I would like to have questions, if possible, but make them precise and helpful type.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:03.260
Just to waste money or to take a floor, one should not ask questions. Thank you.

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:14.720
I'll have some water, please.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:33.160
- Mostly there are sahaja yogies sitting here.
- Any questions?

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:50.780
- I think they all want their realization.
- Hmm, also they have become thoughtless.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:59.480
As a first result of Kundalini awakening, there's no thought - even if you want to think of questions you cannot, is there's no thought at all.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:07.980
The first thing that happens that the Kundalini rises and goes between the two thoughts and creates a position where there is no thought

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:13.460
and then you go beyond so, I think, some of you, I find, have already become thoughtless

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:17.660
but if there is any question, you can think about, you can ask.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:29.640
- Yes.
- Mother, what is the source of evil and where does it come from?

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:37.240
- Kundalini?
- What is the source of the evil, where does it come from?
- Evil comes from your choices.

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:44.020
You see, you have got the freedom, you asked for the freedom - alright?. Now, freedom is given to you.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:50.440
Then what happens that in your freedom you, you, you seek uh... things

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:58.340
uh... which are not good for you, in ignorance, in darkness and when you are in darkness uh.. you start accepting

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:04.700
all those bad things and you feel comfortable with them, gradually, because your ego is there

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:11.620
whatever satisfies your ego, you try to do that or some conditionings that have come to you, you try to uh..

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:18.240
act according to your conditionings.So it's a long story sometimes like for ages together, supposing in a family,

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:26.640
people have been all their lives been evil - the mother, the grandfather, the great-grandfather - all of them have been doing evil things

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.920
then what happens in that family even the dead who are

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:38.420
forefathers and all that - even the dead - they hover on these people and teach them bad things and tell them how to do it

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:46.180
and they become geniuses in this. There are many people in our country and in your country and everywhere, who, who learn this craft

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:53.500
and create the evil. Now in this world, I don't know how many, at least I know sixteen horrible uh..

00:36:53.760 --> 00:37:01.480
devils have taken birth. Out of them three are lead women of the worst type but there are many devils who have taken birth

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:07.520
and they are trying to create evil in the world. So as, as there is God,

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:15.180
there are also these evil forces which we have created. They have become from uh..good people uh..

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:23.020
some of them became angels and then fallen angels and then devils - in your freedom one chooses evil.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:35.980
But it is a myth, in a way because if there is light, there's no darkness -

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.880
darkness can, cannot enter into light, it runs away.

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:03.980
Alright, now better we have our realization, is a better thing to do.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.900
I'll get up to tell them.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:24.060
You all have to take out your shoes. I'm happy you all have already done it. Is very good because, as I told you, the elements have to help us

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:30.160
so the Mother Earth helps us a lot. Especially, this Kundalini is placed in the triangular bone

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:36.280
which we call as the Mooladhara, is the, is the support, support of the root

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:43.000
and the center below that is the Mooladhara chakra, is the, is the center of the support of the root

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:50.940
and is made from the same element, the earth element and that's why the Mother Earth helps us a lot

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:55.700
when we put our feet on Her with respect, with respect.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:39:02.580
Now put your feet on the Mother Earth, parallel ways, because we are made of two types of

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:10.280
personalities, one is the left, another is the right. So what we have to do, is to keep them parallel, whichever way is the problem

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:16.000
passes out to the Mother Earth and then you have to put both the hands towards Me just like this.

00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:24.480
After that you have to close your eyes, just close your eyes.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:32.140
And to remember that your right hand is for action and left hand is for desire.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:40.020
So you put your left hand all the time towards Me like this on your lap - you have to be comfortable so that you are not disturbed.

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:45.700
Put the left hand and now right hand you put it on your heart

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:57.820
and close your eyes. Whatever we have to do, we will do with our right hand on the left hand side

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.880
and that's very simple which I will tell you one after another. Keep your eyes shut.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:09.880
Please don't open your eyes. If you open your eyes, the Kundalini will go back so please keep your eyes completely shut.

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:23.320
[SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS TO SOME YOGI ASIDE - UNCLEAR]

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:32.460
Now, you put your right hand on your heart where resides

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.460
your Spirit - Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:44.500
and the Holy Ghost is the reflection of the Primordial Mother, His power.

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:50.460
So now what you have to do, is to bring forth the yoga of this - the union of these two.

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:56.740
You have to say, assert in your heart or ask Me a question, a simple question three times,

00:40:57.140 --> 00:41:02.980
"Mother, am I the Spirit, Mother, am I the Spirit,

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.500
Mother, am I the Spirit?"

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:26.940
Hmmm, now on the left-hand side again. You must know that as,

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:34.180
you can ask this question about the Spirit, you have to know also that you are

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:42.940
your own master because if you are the Spirit, you are your own master - you don't need anybody to tell you

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:50.740
so you have to ask second question by putting right-hand on the upper part of the stomach, on the upper part of the stomach.

00:41:53.080 --> 00:42:00.600
You have to ask the question by putting your right-hand on the upper part of the stomach and say, "Mother,

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:09.560
am I my own guru?" Please ask this question three times.

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:15.280
"Mother, am I my own guru, Mother, am I my own guru?"

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:36.020
Now, three times asking this question, you put down your right hand down below on the stomach,

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:42.540
on the left-hand side. Please don't open your eyes, put it on the left-hand side. Here -

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:51.960
on the left-hand side - now here you have to ask a question

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:04.340
"Mother, can I be initiated?"

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:09.060
Ask a question within yourself, three times.

00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:14.820
"Mother, can I be initiated?" without feeling guilty, three times.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:26.120
Now I say, "Yes," so to initiate yourself

00:43:27.400 --> 00:43:32.360
you ask, you say, "Mother, please teach me,

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:38.560
please give me the knowledge of the Divine.

00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:46.800
Please give me the true knowledge, please give me the pure knowledge." That's what you have to ask because I cannot force it upon you,

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:50.460
you have to ask for it. Please put the hand.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:12.320
Now, six times because there are six petals. Hmm

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:37.360
Now raise this hand higher

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:45.440
again on to the same stomach point where I told you is the center of the Primordial master.

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:52.640
Press it hard here now on the stomach on the left hand side in the upper part of the abdomen.

00:44:53.680 --> 00:45:00.060
Here you ask Me a question, "Mother,"

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:12.120
as you have asked Me already, "Am I my own guru?" You can say without asking a question, with full

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:17.640
asserting, with full right, with full confidence,

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:27.360
"Mother, I am my own master. " Please say it ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.620
Hmmm

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:10.220
Just now we can have it, just now we should have it [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:15.700
Now, raise your right hand on your heart.

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:23.280
Here resides your Spirit and here you have to say with full assertion

00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:34.960
"Mother, I am the Spirit," you have to say twelve times because there are twelve petals to this beautiful center of heart.

00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:40.320
"Mother, I am the Spirit," please say it ten times.

00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:47.680
Hmm. Please don't feel guilty,

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:52.640
please don't feel guilty, please don't feel guilty.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:59.780
You must know that God Almighty is the ocean of love,

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:09.520
is the ocean of compassion and last of all He is the ocean, ocean of forgiveness

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:16.780
so don't feel guilty, don't judge yourself - you have to achieve your glory by understanding that you're glorious

00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:22.100
so don't have any diffidence, just say with full confidence,

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:26.160
"Mother, I am the Spirit."

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:43.240
Now, again don't feel guilty, please don't feel guilty - is the biggest catch

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:47.540
and don't feel guilty, is wrong to feel guilty,

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:55.680
is harmful, is self destructive - don't feel guilty for anything.

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:03.660
Now raise your hand on to the base of the neck,

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:13.500
on the left-hand side, take it backwards a little bit, press it hard and here you have to say -

00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:22.280
press it hard at the back, take it at the back little bit, yes furthermore, furthermore, yeah.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:31.660
Press it hard, hold it hard. Here is the center when you feel guilty, it gets caught up.

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:40.160
So now, sixteen times you have to say, "Mother I'm not guilty, I'm not guilty, I'm not guilty,"

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:44.880
and if you are indulging too much into this kind of a thing and still you believe

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:51.140
that you are guilty then say it 108 times as a punishment.

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:59.320
Hmmm, sixteen times,

00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:10.020
sixteen times.

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:34.420
Hmmm, now take this hand on your forehead

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:41.540
across - this hand, right hand, left hand towards Me - on your forehead across, forehead -

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:50.100
forehead is where My red mark is - across, left hand towards Me.

00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:59.620
Now, here is the center of Lord Jesus Christ so you have to say, "Mother, please

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:06.260
I want to forgive everyone,

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:14.060
I want to forgive everyone, I forgive everyone, " say it from your heart. It's a myth

00:50:14.300 --> 00:50:19.680
not to forgive, it's a myth because when you don't forgive, what are you doing

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:27.880
and when you forgive also what are you doing? It's a myth, get over it. Just say, "I forgive everyone,"

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:32.000
you can say, "Shri Mataji, I forgive everyone."

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:40.180
Now, say it from your heart, don't feel guilty, please don't feel guilty.

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:44.360
If you're feeling guilty, then is will not work out.

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:51.240
You may put your hand at the back of your head,

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:57.340
back of your head, without feeling guilty, you have to say

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:04.680
"O Lord, if I've done any mistakes, please forgive me," but not to feel guilty, again I say.

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:10.400
"If I have done any mistakes knowingly, unknowingly, please forgive me."

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:20.360
Again feeling guilty

00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:31.100
Just say, "Please forgive me," He is the ocean of forgiveness - don't have to bother much about it. Now -

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:39.720
left Vishuddhi is there - please don't feel guilty, still catching on that center.

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:48.880
Alright, now put your right hand on top of your head at the fontanel bone area. Place your

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:58.540
palm hard on the center of the head and try to move your head in a way

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:06.080
it is clockwise. Try to move your scalp pressing hard with your palm.

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:10.180
At this point again I cannot cross your freedom

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:17.260
so you have to say, "Mother, I want my realization, please give me my realization."

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:22.660
Please say this seven times because there are seven seats of all the centers.

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:38.100
Hmmm. [SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:22.100
Now put down your hand, don't open your eyes please.

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:29.760
Put left hand on top of your head and see if there's a cool breeze coming in.

00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:35.420
Just put  your left hand on top of your head. See if there's a cool breeze coming in.

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:49.820
Just feel it, little bit raise higher, raise higher,

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:54.240
move it forward, backward - see now if there's a cool breeze coming in.

00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:09.500
Move on this side, I think. Take it on this side.

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:20.960
Is it coming, cool breeze? Say those it is coming.

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:27.340
Yes coming, alright, good idea.

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:38.900
- Is it coming? Say loudly.
- Yes, Mother.
- It's good!

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:45.780
Now ask the question by putting left hand towards Me and right hand on top of your head

00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:51.920
Ask a question, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:03.140
You'll get it more - three times.

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:13.060
Put your hands up all those who are feeling it also. Put up your hands, now open your eyes,

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:17.160
watch Me without thinking. Put up your hands like this and ask a question,

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:25.100
ask a question in your heart, "Is this the breeze of the Holy Ghost, is this the Chaitanya?

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:30.320
Is this the Brahm, is this the All-Pervading power of God, is this?

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:40.660
- Do you feel more when you ask questions? Yes, say it loudly.
- Yes.

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:50.360
Haan, good! Now in your hands you see yourself.

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.460
Better now, in the hands?

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:09.040
Those who are feeling the cool breeze, raise your hands all of you - both your hands. All those who are feeling the cool breeze, raise your hands

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:17.380
Just... It's great! Is great.

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:24.560
Keep it this side also, keep your hands up, I would like to see who are getting the cool breeze - higher.

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:31.140
Good! You didn't feel it? You will, very soon.

00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:38.360
