00:49.020 --> 01:04.000
[Music]

00:50.450 --> 01:07.790
I wonder how many give me that Vista is

01:04.000 --> 01:13.020
the center of gravity

01:07.790 --> 01:16.680
which uses the welcome all which will

01:13.020 --> 01:26.360
rotate by which we realize that we are

01:16.680 --> 01:29.360
inclined left or just other night this

01:26.360 --> 01:29.360
twelve

01:29.900 --> 01:36.700
we have to be aware of

01:33.770 --> 01:36.700
because otherwise

01:46.550 --> 01:49.599
[Music]

01:53.580 --> 02:02.070
because if you Center it healthy and are

01:59.530 --> 02:02.070
succeeding

02:04.220 --> 02:11.990
completely so this to me is specific

02:12.290 --> 02:21.530
between you understanding

02:17.270 --> 02:21.530
I'm the understanding

02:25.470 --> 02:30.810
waste it has to be helped

02:31.310 --> 02:34.310
it

02:34.590 --> 02:39.540
the newborn during his nine five

02:37.060 --> 02:39.540
children

02:40.880 --> 02:44.210

02:46.510 --> 02:56.930
it works Edom you are testing instrument

02:51.640 --> 03:00.370
so if you try to do something of your

02:56.930 --> 03:00.370
own something too much

03:03.440 --> 03:08.259
[Music]

03:26.670 --> 03:44.640
for example if Emily says that whatever

03:38.050 --> 03:44.640
is there a ninja but not before

03:51.200 --> 04:11.139
[Music]

03:52.900 --> 04:11.139
because our genes

04:20.870 --> 04:24.950
in nature to see

04:26.620 --> 04:43.830
wonderful what she doesn't she doesn't

04:30.220 --> 04:43.830
she made itself up damages a lot to me

04:48.240 --> 04:56.840
I got the wisdom it's the one

05:10.800 --> 05:23.559
[Music]

05:14.030 --> 05:26.559
outside the gyroscope

05:23.559 --> 05:26.559
evidently

05:30.479 --> 05:37.080
only the personality which is a phenom

05:38.029 --> 06:10.560
if you're frustrated it's if you're

05:43.279 --> 06:27.810
unhappy so count your blessings

06:10.560 --> 06:31.530
[Music]

06:27.810 --> 06:31.530
extreme predictions

06:42.340 --> 06:47.340
but in one spirit

06:49.240 --> 07:01.270
[Music]

06:51.600 --> 07:05.910
I think positions try to stabilize mr.

07:01.270 --> 07:05.910
logically what do we

07:11.870 --> 07:16.850
this one in happy camper

07:20.400 --> 07:27.130
except for you will you study

07:23.040 --> 07:36.280

07:36.280 --> 07:38.490
life

07:42.210 --> 08:32.700
[Music]

07:47.910 --> 08:34.860
when you in this position so we see the

08:32.700 --> 08:37.640
quality the best and that is whether

08:34.860 --> 08:37.640
religion

08:38.610 --> 08:45.610
so how wisdom is important that you even

08:42.190 --> 08:51.040
become a star chief your wisdom you know

08:45.610 --> 08:55.530
how it is only when you have done focal

08:51.040 --> 08:55.530
points and just leave your Center

08:58.700 --> 09:01.210
that's

09:02.810 --> 09:17.170
when people tell me about someone as if

09:12.460 --> 09:17.170
it was the another ball

09:20.060 --> 09:27.160

09:34.129 --> 09:37.089
is reflecting the other

09:41.290 --> 09:47.130
there's no entry is determined for this

09:50.670 --> 09:54.810
how do you end up

09:55.199 --> 10:06.579
you live by your wisdom by understanding

10:00.279 --> 10:10.060
itself in you may think is the mirror on

10:06.579 --> 10:14.970
which is reflected it's just an illusion

10:10.060 --> 10:18.309
that is appearing and we are very about

10:14.970 --> 10:19.509
holy you gave me profound as soon as you

10:18.309 --> 10:23.730

10:32.680 --> 10:44.360
there is a relative quality are all the

10:37.670 --> 10:48.190
refrigerants arguments that's how with

10:44.360 --> 10:48.190
