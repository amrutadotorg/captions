1
00:00:06,642 --> 00:00:13,482
In this country we had a struggle of
freedom. I was a part and parcel of that.

2
00:00:14,128 --> 00:00:18,868
My parents were part and parcel of that.
They were rich people, quite rich, I should say,

3
00:00:18,915 --> 00:00:25,995
from every standard. You'll be amazed,
My father burnt all his suits. They were

4
00:00:25,995 --> 00:00:32,938
stitched in England. My mother burnt all
her saris. They used to spin their own

5
00:00:32,938 --> 00:00:40,456
clothes and wear them. I had only one coat
throughout My education, when I was in Lahore,

6
00:00:40,456 --> 00:00:48,487
which is terribly cold, sometimes can be
like London. But we never grudged and

7
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:52,118
never grumbled and never said that, "Our
father should have looked after us and done

8
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:56,708
something. Why did he just sacrifice everything
for the country?" Never, never, never.

9
00:00:58,552 --> 00:01:09,462
That quality was created, I should say, by
Mahatma Gandhi. He made everybody so

10
00:01:09,462 --> 00:01:18,325
transformed into a new personality. All the
money that we had, everything that we had,

11
00:01:18,325 --> 00:01:25,578
all conveniences, all housing, everything
was given up, not only by My father but

12
00:01:25,578 --> 00:01:35,644
so many of them otherwise we could not
have got our freedom. To get our freedom

13
00:01:36,216 --> 00:01:44,366
this country has sacrificed so much.
I must say, Gandhiji had a special charm.

14
00:01:45,197 --> 00:01:53,017
I don't know how he managed. He was like
'Touch of Midas', touched anybody, he
became transformed, you see.

15
00:01:57,387 --> 00:02:03,767
And he was an extremely strict man - very
kind to Me, to children - but he was an

16
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:10,025
extremely, extremely strict man. He
would not tolerate any nonsense at all.

17
00:02:12,414 --> 00:02:20,484
Throughout, if you study the way all these
people were brought up, not only for freedom

18
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:29,761
of or independence but even before that for
spiritual life, anywhere, there's one thing

19
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:35,416
very common, is sacrifice and the
consciousness that you are doing

20
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:41,026
something great, consciouness that you
are part and parcel of the Whole.

21
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:48,372
People: [Long live Mahatma Gandhi, Long live
Mahatma Gandhi, Long live Mahatma Gandhi]

22
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:59,679
[People shouting slogans]

23
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:06,624
I've seen it with My own eyes such people
in this country, whom you may call legendary

24
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:13,897
but I've seen it. Thousands of people were
killed and butchered. Children died -

25
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:24,822
nobody shed tears, nobody shed tears. Now,
after that we are here to get our freedom,

26
00:03:26,192 --> 00:03:36,562
to get the freedom for our Spirit, to 
make our Spirit free from our greed, lust,

27
00:03:37,058 --> 00:03:43,448
from your anger, from our conditionings,
from our terrible ego.
