00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.321
we felt, we are here for various things

00:00:08.764 --> 00:00:16.184
to enjoy our physical being, our mental being, our material side,

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:23.864
our powers, our possessions, our friendships

00:00:24.244 --> 00:00:29.184
and our limited love. We worked very hard with it

00:00:30.804 --> 00:00:35.184
to achieve some sort of a joy out of all that.

00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:44.744
But the other day I was watching one film very funny and a very - [UNCLEAR - SHE'D] a grotesque type of a film it was

00:00:45.544 --> 00:00:50.464
lot of hard truths were there - showing a man trying to

00:00:51.564 --> 00:00:59.484
achieve some goal of marrying a particular lady, for that trying to get some money.

00:01:00.284 --> 00:01:04.644
The picture was presented in a very, I should say, in a very, very

00:01:07.184 --> 00:01:13.244
violent way which was really repulsive to My mind but

00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:18.604
it proved that all these pursuits are good for nothing.

00:01:19.964 --> 00:01:27.044
They lead you nowhere, you're left high and dry as you were - much worse than what you,

00:01:27.344 --> 00:01:34.324
you were born. Your innocence is lost, your sense of love is lost,

00:01:35.024 --> 00:01:41.024
your value system is lost and you are absolutely

00:01:41.424 --> 00:01:47.284
in a , in a position that you see that life has been worth nothing.

00:01:48.284 --> 00:01:55.224
Some people, of course, take help from limited understanding,

00:01:55.484 --> 00:02:02.084
"Oh, I have four children, I have insurance for them, I have to look after them,"

00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:08.864
or some people think that they have written few books and these books will be good for others

00:02:09.064 --> 00:02:13.784
or they have done some painting so it will help others and it will be a nice thing.

00:02:14.144 --> 00:02:20.804
But as Shakespeare has very beautifully and delicately always suggested that the life is futile.

00:02:21.864 --> 00:02:27.744
All such people who show that, we call them avadhuta, is the kind of a prophet

00:02:28.044 --> 00:02:32.224
who shows that the whole thing is futile - that is very important.

00:02:32.524 --> 00:02:40.024
Unless and until it is shown that all such pursuits are futile, people don't take to something higher - they're not aware of it.

00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:46.224
Is better to tell them beforehand that all such pursuits are futile. [ASIDE - PLEASE OPEN THE DOOR]

00:02:47.384 --> 00:02:53.864
Now the trouble is that we reach partly

00:02:54.824 --> 00:03:02.404
to that conclusion many a times in our life, we reach that conclusion sometimes totally also - so what?

00:03:04.644 --> 00:03:11.504
We start thinking - then why am I here, why God has created me from amoeba stage to this stage?

00:03:12.184 --> 00:03:16.324
What was the need for Him to bother so much, if He existed?

00:03:17.224 --> 00:03:23.404
To create me into a human-being and then make my life miserable and then I die -

00:03:23.844 --> 00:03:31.044
many people must be asking this question to God who Himself is an imagination for many.

00:03:33.044 --> 00:03:40.064
So we come to a proper, logical end, logical understanding, conclusion

00:03:40.724 --> 00:03:44.124
that there must be some purpose to this life,

00:03:46.584 --> 00:03:54.084
there must be some meaning to this life and that's what exactly you have to know

00:03:54.544 --> 00:04:00.124
that you have a very, very great purpose. The greatest purpose is that

00:04:00.624 --> 00:04:06.604
God Almighty who has created you - you may believe in him or you may not believe in Him but He exists.

00:04:08.104 --> 00:04:16.044
He exists and He loves you and He loves you very much - has created this universe only for you to come on the stage.

00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:23.084
He has created this beautiful world that you people as human-beings seeking Him,

00:04:23.544 --> 00:04:30.264
will come up to this point that ultimately you are at the threshold of His Kingdom.

00:04:31.084 --> 00:04:37.684
And then something little has to happen to you so that you jump into that new awareness

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:45.864
which is the awareness of the Kingdom of God. It is not at all difficult

00:04:46.744 --> 00:04:53.264
if you understand one point, that so far we have become human-beings

00:04:53.624 --> 00:05:01.164
without going into any turmoil or without going into any effort. So if you have to achieve a higher state,

00:05:01.524 --> 00:05:08.724
what effort can we put in? I had a big discussion with a television gentleman the other day,

00:05:09.264 --> 00:05:15.684
who was saying all the time that, "Mother, how can it be instant?" I said, "Then tell Me how many hours it should take,

00:05:16.284 --> 00:05:24.304
how many minutes it should take?" Because if it has to happen beyond the time there cannot be any time limit to it as Nature is.

00:05:24.544 --> 00:05:30.484
In the nature you find that a flower

00:05:31.524 --> 00:05:38.604
becomes a fruit - no one sees is becoming. It is so minutely working out nobody sees.

00:05:39.064 --> 00:05:46.244
it just works out automatically, spontaneously and how much time, you cannot say.

00:05:46.764 --> 00:05:52.804
You cannot definitely say that at this time this flower is going to get transformed,

00:05:53.044 --> 00:05:59.904
nor can you say that it will be a complete fruit by this time because all living things are done beyond time.

00:06:00.564 --> 00:06:06.704
They have no relationship with time but they have relationship with the moods

00:06:07.124 --> 00:06:14.304
but not with the time. For example, the Mother Earth is in good mood, She's very happy -

00:06:14.924 --> 00:06:21.564
I mean, when human-beings are nice, She has to be happy - and when She produces beautiful

00:06:23.344 --> 00:06:30.284
seasons, everything works out smoothly. But She's angry, annoyed

00:06:30.704 --> 00:06:36.964
and She creates earthquakes, all kinds of problems, then

00:06:38.884 --> 00:06:45.064
no seasons - it's her mood. If She creates anything great,

00:06:45.544 --> 00:06:50.184
She creates or else it is Her mood, She can create a big, vast

00:06:52.184 --> 00:06:59.784
ocean or a huge, big sandstorm

00:07:00.524 --> 00:07:05.344
or could be anything that you can call as

00:07:05.604 --> 00:07:09.004
a mountain or a river or whatever way She whatever way she wants to do.

00:07:09.244 --> 00:07:14.324
It's Her, it's her whim. Can you ask the Mother Earth, "Why did you put Himalayas there?

00:07:16.424 --> 00:07:19.544
Why was this river Ganges is flowing in India?"

00:07:21.824 --> 00:07:25.164
We never ask Her. "How much time did You take to make it?

00:07:26.624 --> 00:07:33.964
What was the time limit for You to create it?" You cannot put all these things to Her, She does it the way She wants to do it.

00:07:35.084 --> 00:07:39.984
If she wants, She can create deserts after deserts, so

00:07:40.744 --> 00:07:47.624
we, the ones who have these watches in our hands, must know that She doesn't go by our watch.

00:07:48.704 --> 00:07:56.664
We have to set our watch according to Her watch which is a very difficult thing and that's why we are in trouble

00:07:56.944 --> 00:08:03.144
because we cannot set our programs with the programs of the Divine. She works according

00:08:03.384 --> 00:08:11.084
to the Divine nature of Her being and that's how we find that when we try to excavate too much out of Earth,

00:08:11.364 --> 00:08:16.324
use Her too much, make Her completely barren, then She reacts

00:08:17.544 --> 00:08:23.724
and Her reactions come in, in so many ways that the atmosphere is spoilt, you can't exist in such a place

00:08:23.924 --> 00:08:27.944
you have to leave that place because of pollution - it's such a nice

00:08:28.284 --> 00:08:34.184
integration with other elements also that people have to leave that place and they cannot do more excavations.

00:08:36.804 --> 00:08:42.664
All this happens, not only with Mother Earth, with all the elements. It is their mood

00:08:43.524 --> 00:08:48.824
that works out everything and when their moods are spoilt

00:08:48.884 --> 00:08:56.544
they can do any havoc they want to - people cannot explain why a particular time

00:08:58.324 --> 00:09:03.084
lightning hit some place, what was the purpose of lightning?

00:09:03.584 --> 00:09:07.464
Why it rained so heavily at such a particular point? Because we are not tuned

00:09:08.064 --> 00:09:15.704
with the Kingdom of God, His laws, His methods, which are tuned with the Divine beings of all the

00:09:16.084 --> 00:09:22.184
elements. Now it is hard to believe what I'm saying because people might think how does Mother know?

00:09:22.704 --> 00:09:30.524
That's another question, you see, as everybody has a right to ask Me but I would say that it is better that you also know as I know,

00:09:31.204 --> 00:09:38.684
which is very easy, and also that to know something is not by your brain.

00:09:39.404 --> 00:09:45.944
For this, your brain is not sufficient to answer these questions, for this you have to become something more than the brain,

00:09:46.964 --> 00:09:53.584
more than this limited time, more than this limited brain, more than this logic

00:09:53.864 --> 00:10:01.184
that you think you can find out everything through your logic - you cannot. And this is what has to happen to us.

00:10:01.564 --> 00:10:06.544
First of all we must understand that we are very limited as human-beings.

00:10:06.864 --> 00:10:12.624
In our ego we might think, "Oh, we have done this, we have done that, we have built this nice building, see how beautiful it is!"

00:10:14.324 --> 00:10:19.604
But what have you done? Something was dead, you converted into another dead.

00:10:21.384 --> 00:10:25.904
The One who transforms the flowers into fruits

00:10:26.524 --> 00:10:32.784
could, does all kinds of living things, according to One's mood.

00:10:36.004 --> 00:10:43.204
How can you understand Him with this dead, limited brain - how can you understand Him?

00:10:43.324 --> 00:10:48.744
So there's something has to happen to us that we should go beyond time and

00:10:49.344 --> 00:10:55.884
beyond this limited brain to achieve it. Now one may say that, "For this what should we do?"

00:10:56.404 --> 00:11:03.944
We have to do nothing, as we have done nothing. From animals to this stage we have come without doing anything.

00:11:04.184 --> 00:11:09.624
There is nothing to feel bad that you can do something without doing anything.

00:11:10.144 --> 00:11:14.224
Actually we are doing so many things without doing anything - we're breathing

00:11:16.784 --> 00:11:24.084
we are, our heart is beating - everything is happening automatically

00:11:24.604 --> 00:11:29.124
and we're existing like that without doing anything.

00:11:30.284 --> 00:11:33.564
So when we are doing something without doing anything

00:11:34.784 --> 00:11:40.424
- the evolution that has taken place has taken place without doing anything and if you have to go higher,

00:11:40.764 --> 00:11:47.464
we must accept with all humility, that it will be done because we are built-in that way.

00:11:47.984 --> 00:11:51.744
Like a little seed has all the future trees

00:11:53.424 --> 00:11:59.304
embedded in it, in the same way, all our future is embedded within us.

00:11:59.804 --> 00:12:06.204
That's how we have come today to this state in a special way, as you see here, what we have been

00:12:06.464 --> 00:12:13.184
from Carbon we rose, supposing - Carbon is at this red spot and then gradually we started moving upward.

00:12:13.424 --> 00:12:16.464
At the yellow stage the

00:12:17.284 --> 00:12:22.084
ether was created or Antriksha was created and all the stars -

00:12:22.404 --> 00:12:30.104
- Can you bring it further here for everybody to see?
- Would You like to stand here?
- Alright
- No, I would say that one
- Yes.

00:12:30.364 --> 00:12:33.324
If you could bring it there, everybody can see it better

00:12:35.344 --> 00:12:40.804
and I hide it. With the second one

00:12:43.584 --> 00:12:50.024
all the Nature, all that you see in matter was created.

00:12:52.184 --> 00:12:57.424
By the third one, which we call as the Nabhi chakra,

00:13:00.964 --> 00:13:05.904
everything was sorted out at a very gross level.

00:13:06.244 --> 00:13:12.764
As you know in Chemistry, that all the elements are put into a proper periodic law

00:13:13.284 --> 00:13:19.964
and in that periodic law, this period is for, say,  Carbon, this is for Hydrogen - like that there are

00:13:20.224 --> 00:13:28.284
eight classifications, at a very gross level so, they were given different valencies.

00:13:29.404 --> 00:13:34.184
Ultimately at human level also, you were given ten valencies.

00:13:34.444 --> 00:13:41.664
As you know, in the matter there are only eight valencies and in the

00:13:43.184 --> 00:13:50.744
animals there are nine valencies but in the man, human-beings only, there are ten valencies which are

00:13:51.044 --> 00:13:57.464
told to us in a very gross manner - because, I think, that time human-beings were extremely gross - as ten commandments.

00:13:58.164 --> 00:14:03.264
But people listened and obeyed those days without questioning but when they questioned

00:14:03.564 --> 00:14:09.704
in these modern times, better to tell them in a very subtler way, that these are eight valencies within us

00:14:10.184 --> 00:14:17.604
which actually make us as human-beings and when we disobey those valencies, then we go

00:14:17.864 --> 00:14:23.064
either to the left or to the right and we become either sub-normal or abnormal.

00:14:23.424 --> 00:14:28.024
To be normal we have to have those eight valencies within us.

00:14:29.404 --> 00:14:35.604
But why these valencies were created, is another question which I will tell you later.

00:14:35.804 --> 00:14:38.744
Then the another center was created -

00:14:38.924 --> 00:14:44.584
the center, this one, came at the time when people started feeling the fear -

00:14:45.844 --> 00:14:51.464
fear of animals, fear of nature, fear of something unknown -

00:14:52.704 --> 00:14:58.264
a protection was to be built-in and for that protection a deity

00:14:59.104 --> 00:15:06.664
is created and this deity is the deity of our protection and that's how this center was created.

00:15:06.904 --> 00:15:13.284
In human-beings it acts first at twelve years of age in the sternum bone when

00:15:15.804 --> 00:15:23.024
the anti-bodies are created and these anti-bodies start getting distributed completely to the whole body

00:15:23.224 --> 00:15:28.484
but is the sternum bone which gives the message to the anti-bodies when they have to fight.

00:15:28.784 --> 00:15:34.564
So, an army was created within us to fight all that is invading us.

00:15:35.004 --> 00:15:42.644
Then we have the higher center than that, is the center what we call of the center of Vishuddhi - is the center where

00:15:42.984 --> 00:15:49.364
human-beings raise their head up from animal stage to this stage

00:15:50.824 --> 00:15:58.504
when they raise their head, then this center became a perfect center in the sense it developed sixteen petals.

00:15:59.604 --> 00:16:05.944
We take our face for granted, we take everything like our eyes, nose, ears, everything for granted.

00:16:06.264 --> 00:16:13.504
All this was created in a very special way because we raised our head up and we became human-beings.

00:16:13.724 --> 00:16:21.784
But as soon as we raised our head, a complication started building-up within ourselves and that complication was when,

00:16:23.404 --> 00:16:30.824
I would say, Adam and Eve raised their head and wanted to find out what is this knowledge.

00:16:31.444 --> 00:16:38.444
That is the time when we first made a big mistake - if we had not made mistakes at that time,

00:16:39.144 --> 00:16:46.144
I think, the realization would have been achieved thousands of years back. What ever it is, the mistake is made so

00:16:46.604 --> 00:16:52.084
God has forgiven us and He thought that He should try to help you to come out of it,

00:16:52.264 --> 00:16:55.284
out of the mistake and achieve your realization.

00:16:56.324 --> 00:17:03.664
Because of this center you build, started building up two institutions within yourself, called the ego and super-ego.

00:17:05.424 --> 00:17:12.304
Somebody said to you something, you get conditioned and you get your super-ego and somebody uh...

00:17:13.944 --> 00:17:18.784
says, challenges your ego and you develop

00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:25.144
your ego or when you talk to others in an aggressive way also you develop your ego.

00:17:26.384 --> 00:17:33.704
Also these two, two other channels that you see left and right, are the channels which are

00:17:34.264 --> 00:17:41.704
within us working on the left-hand side, the power of desire and on the right-hand side the power of action.

00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:46.064
As a result of that, we develop from the left side, the power

00:17:46.284 --> 00:17:54.264
of super-ego you can call it or we can say the myth of super-ego and on the right-hand side the, the temper of ego.

00:17:54.584 --> 00:18:01.484
That's how both of these things join and we develop a personality which has it's I-ness

00:18:01.724 --> 00:18:07.004
like I become so and so, you become so and so, another person becomes so and so.

00:18:07.224 --> 00:18:12.784
This I-ness develops, gradually we start identifying ourselves because of this I-ness with

00:18:13.004 --> 00:18:20.884
other things like, "I am British, I am Indian, uh.. I am this caste, this community, this race,

00:18:21.004 --> 00:18:28.004
this country, " all those identifications starts coming in our head and we start building up our personality

00:18:28.204 --> 00:18:33.384
much more strongly separated, alienated from the rest of it.

00:18:35.304 --> 00:18:42.484
So our collectivity, the oneness with the whole,

00:18:42.704 --> 00:18:47.424
is lost - we become a separate entity.

00:18:48.664 --> 00:18:55.664
By this center we become a human-being, I should say, and then another center is built-up here.

00:18:55.924 --> 00:19:00.764
On this center a deity, which we know as Lord Jesus Christ, came on this earth.

00:19:01.324 --> 00:19:08.504
Because He thought that these two, two institutions are very heavy in human-beings - the ego and superego -

00:19:08.744 --> 00:19:14.544
and unless and until these two institutions are, somehow or the other, sucked in

00:19:15.024 --> 00:19:23.024
there is no possibility of an ascent and so this great deity came on this earth to suffer for us and

00:19:24.324 --> 00:19:31.644
to create a position there. Now if this deity can be awakened, then it sucks in

00:19:32.464 --> 00:19:39.184
those problems of ego and superego and that's how we get opened to the Kingdom of God.

00:19:39.484 --> 00:19:45.044
Ultimately, we pierce through this Kingdom of God from here and we become the Self,

00:19:45.284 --> 00:19:48.304
[UNCLEAR - LIZE IF OR AS IF?] we enter into the

00:19:48.804 --> 00:19:54.804
chamber of God Almighty, you can say or into his court where

00:19:55.044 --> 00:20:02.624
after the kingdom you enter into His court by piercing through this and you get the powers that a citizen has to get

00:20:02.964 --> 00:20:08.604
from His Kingdom. Now what should be done

00:20:09.144 --> 00:20:15.324
to again enlighten those deities which are within you.

00:20:15.944 --> 00:20:23.584
Something had to be do, done and that is what is within us the triangular bone, in the triangular bone

00:20:23.804 --> 00:20:29.864
you find the Kundalini. This Kundalini is nothing else but the reflection of the Holy Ghost.

00:20:30.064 --> 00:20:35.604
In the Bible there isn't much written about Holy Ghost and people really don't know because I asked a priest

00:20:35.844 --> 00:20:42.504
and he says, "I'm a agnostic, I don't know." If he's agnostic, why, what is he doing there? He says, "I'm doing my job."

00:20:42.904 --> 00:20:51.244
So I mean, what job can you do when you don't know about the thing like a professor in Cambridge university doesn't know what is Physics and what is he doing his job, how can he do it?

00:20:51.444 --> 00:20:58.704
You have to know about your uh..what you're professing. So they don't know anything about Holy ghost and this Holy Ghost

00:20:58.944 --> 00:21:05.364
is reflected within us as the Kundalini and this Kundalini has to rise,

00:21:05.604 --> 00:21:12.484
pass through these centers, awaken all these deities, awaken Christ by which to suck in these

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:19.064
two problems within us, open out the gate and then we enter into the Kingdom

00:21:19.304 --> 00:21:24.624
of God and then ultimately we enter into the court of

00:21:25.444 --> 00:21:32.484
God Almighty. This is how the whole story was built-up and that's how we have to get our realization.

00:21:33.044 --> 00:21:37.964
But it takes hardly any time. It is called in Sanskrit 'tatshand'

00:21:38.184 --> 00:21:42.844
means the same moment - there's not a split of a second also in between - tatshand,

00:21:43.224 --> 00:21:47.664
immediately it does. Like if you put the seed in a,

00:21:49.584 --> 00:21:57.004
in the Mother Earth's uh.. care, in Her warmth, immediately it starts sprouting -

00:21:57.384 --> 00:22:03.124
you can't say when it started. If it is wet, immediately it starts

00:22:03.624 --> 00:22:10.524
sprouting so, if there is somebody like that which we call the 'Sandrakarudna',  the one who has got

00:22:10.784 --> 00:22:15.244
that moisture and that compassion of the Mother Earth

00:22:16.064 --> 00:22:24.104
that person can instantly raise the Kundalini, is all described in the, in the Scriptures in India and many others

00:22:24.384 --> 00:22:28.884
but the problem is that Bible being a very microscopic book

00:22:30.804 --> 00:22:37.944
cannot contain everything that is knowledge nor can it contain a person like Christ.

00:22:38.144 --> 00:22:44.224
You have to go to other books to find out what Christ was, how He came on Earth, what was His background -

00:22:44.424 --> 00:22:52.604
you cannot just say that, "I believe in Christ and I go to church so I have the selected one - Christ will catch my hand and will take me to Heaven."

00:22:53.704 --> 00:23:01.244
Is a wrong idea people have and if you live with that idea, I'm sure, a day will come when you will have to repent.

00:23:01.544 --> 00:23:09.584
Christ Himself has said that, "You are to be born again, " and when Nichadamas asked Him, "What do You mean, have I to enter into the womb of my mother?"

00:23:09.824 --> 00:23:17.464
He clearly said that, "No, whatever is born of the flesh is the flesh, " but I'm saying, you're to be born of the Holy Ghost and this is the Holy Ghost

00:23:17.664 --> 00:23:25.204
that is to give you your re-birth, this is the Holy Ghost which is your mother - everybody has an individual mother -

00:23:25.424 --> 00:23:31.724
and She's just waiting for this moment to give you Self-realization and that's how you get your Self-realization.

00:23:31.984 --> 00:23:38.924
What we call is baptism, is the same as Self-realization but it has to be a true thing. As in India also many people

00:23:39.184 --> 00:23:45.404
uh... at the age of eight or ten years of the boy, uh.. they say, "He's become a Brahmin now," they give him a thread and all that

00:23:45.664 --> 00:23:52.384
but it's just a ritual just like baptism - is artificial. Actually, to call yourself a Brahmin, you have to be a realized soul.

00:23:52.664 --> 00:23:59.404
Brahmin is the one who knows Brahm, the one who can feel All-Pervading power and that's what should happen to all of us

00:23:59.624 --> 00:24:07.404
when we get our realization. Now, many people say, "Oh I'm a Self-realized person, I'm twice born," - this is self certificate.

00:24:08.044 --> 00:24:14.164
When you get Self-realized first of all, your life is a transformed life - you become virtuous,

00:24:14.364 --> 00:24:21.904
you become righteous - nobody has to tell you, just automatically. You just become that. You become a powerful, compassionate personality.

00:24:22.124 --> 00:24:27.644
And you become like a witness - you start watching the whole world without feeling the pressures or anything.

00:24:28.044 --> 00:24:32.544
This atleast minimum should happen to a person who says is a Self-realized person.

00:24:32.784 --> 00:24:39.024
But I've seen the other day, those people who call themselves twice born, came with a Bible to hit Me and I was just laughing I couldn't

00:24:39.304 --> 00:24:46.724
I mean, the joke was so big that for Me, I just never felt angry or anything - I just started laughing that they should come and hit Me with a Bible.

00:24:47.144 --> 00:24:53.864
So this is what it is. One must know that when you're transformed, the whole life pattern changes - we become innocent.

00:24:54.664 --> 00:25:00.444
As Christ has said, "Thou shalt have adulterous, thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:25:00.684 --> 00:25:03.624
How many Christians there are who have no adulterous eyes?

00:25:03.984 --> 00:25:09.624
Is there innocence by going to church, does even the priests, I don't know,  if they have uh.. got clean eyes?

00:25:09.864 --> 00:25:14.924
So when do you become that is to be seen, to be

00:25:15.144 --> 00:25:21.564
understood, to be experienced, to be truthful, to be honest to yourself - you must know that, "No thus innocence has not come to me."

00:25:21.824 --> 00:25:28.164
And this innocence comes when the Kundalini passes through your Agnya chakra here, then She cleanses your eyes,

00:25:28.564 --> 00:25:33.364
cleansing takes place and you become innocent so much so that you put your eyes on somebody

00:25:33.604 --> 00:25:40.344
or you just look at somebody, in Sanskrit there is 'Kataksh, kataksh nirikshand' - if you look at somebody, that person feels nice.

00:25:40.804 --> 00:25:48.604
If you just put attention to somebody, that person feels nice and this should happen to all of you. If it cannot happen, then what,

00:25:48.864 --> 00:25:55.844
what is the use of saying that, "I've got Self-realization," and appointing yourself as gurus and making money out of that?

00:25:57.484 --> 00:26:05.124
Another thing which was surprising, the gentleman argued with Me that I'm not making any money. I said, "How much will you pay Me, first of all?"

00:26:06.444 --> 00:26:10.844
The second question is, "How much did you pay to Christ?" - Did you?

00:26:11.884 --> 00:26:19.624
You have such a great personality before you, like Christ. I mean, He is the essence of all the personalities and what are we doing about it?

00:26:20.124 --> 00:26:25.624
'Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes' - that's missing and we're paying money for our

00:26:26.964 --> 00:26:31.824
gurus, we're paying money for our seeking - how much did we pay Christ?

00:26:32.444 --> 00:26:39.204
and he didn't see, shut up, he didn't answer anything. And this is a fact that you cannot pay for it,

00:26:39.584 --> 00:26:45.184
you just cannot pay for it. He said, "This Anglo-Saxon brain won't understand unless and until You make them pay."

00:26:45.504 --> 00:26:52.504
I said, "It is too invaluable and if the Anglo-Saxon brain doesn't understand, I do not want to convince them

00:26:53.604 --> 00:27:00.964
by taking money from them." It is devaluation of the whole thing, is something so nonsensical

00:27:01.244 --> 00:27:05.684
that it is absolutely absurd and such a nonsense I will not tolerate

00:27:06.024 --> 00:27:09.704
whether it is Anglo-Saxon or Saxon-Anglo - makes no difference to Me.

00:27:11.424 --> 00:27:18.344
So these brains have to come round and understand that Divine cannot be purchased at any cost.

00:27:18.624 --> 00:27:26.024
You may think too much of your money but you cannot purchase your Divinity in the market - it is not for sale in the market.

00:27:26.384 --> 00:27:34.124
And please understand this. I know there are some people who have come here, have been to other gurus and some of them are identified also with those gurus

00:27:34.324 --> 00:27:40.084
and sometimes they come and fight with Me but why do you want to fight with Me, why not fight with those who have cheated you,

00:27:40.444 --> 00:27:46.944
who have taken money from  you, build their empires, uh.. bought Rolls Royces, why don't you go and fight with them

00:27:47.264 --> 00:27:53.124
where you headlong you went down and did it. Only good point is that you're free before Me

00:27:53.424 --> 00:28:01.344
you have your own ideas - that's a very good substantial thing that encourages Me no doubt but try to understand

00:28:01.664 --> 00:28:09.264
that you are fighting in a wrong place. Where you had to fight, where you had to judge, where you had to know, you made mistakes

00:28:09.764 --> 00:28:14.824
and where you cannot judge, where there is nothing to be judged,

00:28:15.124 --> 00:28:18.164
you are putting your noses too much into it.

00:28:18.424 --> 00:28:25.924
And this is the problem with the brain is, that it doesn't know what is right and what is wrong; For that you must get your realization.

00:28:26.304 --> 00:28:33.964
So, in sahaja yoga what I have thought of is this way that let them have their light first, let be they awakened - all of them should be awakened.

00:28:34.244 --> 00:28:41.784
Let them have their light because they're all light, they're all Spirit, they're all glory. Let them feel that glory, that peace, that bliss within themselves,

00:28:41.924 --> 00:28:46.644
then gradually in that light they will see what sort of a lamp I have got.

00:28:47.064 --> 00:28:53.644
and then they become their own gurus and correct themselves - I don't have to tell them. It is they who look after themselves by understanding

00:28:53.964 --> 00:29:00.584
and this is the best method has worked out because I can tell you this much, never in this world on

00:29:02.204 --> 00:29:09.804
any time there were so many realized souls. Today in this Cambridge to see so many realized souls sitting

00:29:10.044 --> 00:29:17.324
I feel very heartened. I remember the first time I had come ah.. some missionaries, you see, they arranged a program for Me

00:29:17.604 --> 00:29:23.204
with some very old people who could not hear Me nor could see Me. I was amazed at their greatness, you see,

00:29:23.564 --> 00:29:30.264
what am I to do with them and they said, "You just heal them," I said, "For what?" What's the use of

00:29:30.864 --> 00:29:36.524
healing people who are not going to give light? Any, any light which is out of uh.. order

00:29:36.884 --> 00:29:44.244
and which never will be in order, you don't want to give the light but still out of compassion I did it for them whatever was possible.

00:29:44.564 --> 00:29:49.944
But they are useless because they are themselves on the way - one foot in the grave, one foot outside, you see,

00:29:50.144 --> 00:29:55.304
I may save them for a while but they are going to die and what are they going to help? It's you people

00:29:56.204 --> 00:30:03.604
who are on this earth, now responsible for this, have to come up and see that it is your duty

00:30:03.904 --> 00:30:10.004
that at this great moment, at this resurrection time, at this judgment time, you are born with a purpose

00:30:10.264 --> 00:30:16.564
otherwise you could have born at the time uh.. when the people were busy fighting Napoleon -

00:30:16.804 --> 00:30:23.524
no, you are born at this time when you have to fight the ignorance of the people, at such a special time of resurrection,

00:30:23.804 --> 00:30:28.844
about which Mohammad sahab has said that, "Your hands will speak."

00:30:29.484 --> 00:30:35.064
He's talked of resurrection much, much more than he has talked of doomsday but

00:30:35.284 --> 00:30:40.884
Muslims don't want to talk of resurrection, they want to talk of doomsday because they can frighten people to get some money out of them.

00:30:41.284 --> 00:30:47.604
Same with Christianity - Christ has said that this will happen that, you will get

00:30:48.964 --> 00:30:55.464
your realization that Christ will be born within you and all these things have been already revealed to you.

00:30:55.744 --> 00:31:01.244
Even a great poet like William Blake has said that, "Those days when

00:31:01.984 --> 00:31:08.924
there will be resurrection time, men of God will become prophets

00:31:09.264 --> 00:31:16.304
and they will have powers to make others prophets." All those scriptures are to be proved today, everything has to be proved today

00:31:16.564 --> 00:31:23.804
and that is only possible if you become the light yourself otherwise in the darkness what's the use of proving

00:31:24.064 --> 00:31:29.584
that this is red or this is black? Makes no difference to a person who has not seen the light.

00:31:29.904 --> 00:31:36.804
And that is why, I have to make a very humble request to you, that you first get your realization - that is the best way

00:31:37.024 --> 00:31:41.404
you can understand yourself and others. May God bless you!

00:31:41.624 --> 00:31:47.384
I would like to have questions, if possible, but make them precise and helpful type.

00:31:47.664 --> 00:31:54.684
Just to waste money or to take a floor, one should not ask questions. Thank you.

00:32:02.404 --> 00:32:06.144
I'll have some water, please.

00:32:17.184 --> 00:32:24.584
- Mostly there are sahaja yogies sitting here.
- Any questions?

00:32:37.564 --> 00:32:42.204
- I think they all want their realization.
- Hmm, also they have become thoughtless.

00:32:43.504 --> 00:32:50.904
As a first result of Kundalini awakening, there's no thought - even if you want to think of questions you cannot, is there's no thought at all.

00:32:51.324 --> 00:32:59.404
The first thing that happens that the Kundalini rises and goes between the two thoughts and creates a position where there is no thought

00:32:59.884 --> 00:33:04.884
and then you go beyond so, I think, some of you, I find, have already become thoughtless

00:33:05.344 --> 00:33:09.084
but if there is any question, you can think about, you can ask.

00:33:15.724 --> 00:33:21.064
- Yes.
- Mother, what is the source of evil and where does it come from?

00:33:21.424 --> 00:33:28.664
- Kundalini?
- What is the source of the evil, where does it come from?
- Evil comes from your choices.

00:33:29.704 --> 00:33:35.444
You see, you have got the freedom, you asked for the freedom - alright?. Now, freedom is given to you.

00:33:35.944 --> 00:33:41.864
Then what happens that in your freedom you, you, you seek uh... things

00:33:42.184 --> 00:33:49.764
uh... which are not good for you, in ignorance, in darkness and when you are in darkness uh.. you start accepting

00:33:50.044 --> 00:33:56.124
all those bad things and you feel comfortable with them, gradually, because your ego is there

00:33:56.384 --> 00:34:03.044
whatever satisfies your ego, you try to do that or some conditionings that have come to you, you try to uh..

00:34:03.304 --> 00:34:09.664
act according to your conditionings.So it's a long story sometimes like for ages together, supposing in a family,

00:34:10.044 --> 00:34:18.064
people have been all their lives been evil - the mother, the grandfather, the great-grandfather - all of them have been doing evil things

00:34:18.304 --> 00:34:22.344
then what happens in that family even the dead who are

00:34:23.364 --> 00:34:29.844
forefathers and all that - even the dead - they hover on these people and teach them bad things and tell them how to do it

00:34:30.084 --> 00:34:37.604
and they become geniuses in this. There are many people in our country and in your country and everywhere, who, who learn this craft

00:34:37.884 --> 00:34:44.924
and create the evil. Now in this world, I don't know how many, at least I know sixteen horrible uh..

00:34:45.184 --> 00:34:52.904
devils have taken birth. Out of them three are lead women of the worst type but there are many devils who have taken birth

00:34:53.164 --> 00:34:58.944
and they are trying to create evil in the world. So as, as there is God,

00:34:59.224 --> 00:35:06.604
there are also these evil forces which we have created. They have become from uh..good people uh..

00:35:07.324 --> 00:35:14.444
some of them became angels and then fallen angels and then devils - in your freedom one chooses evil.

00:35:22.864 --> 00:35:27.404
But it is a myth, in a way because if there is light, there's no darkness -

00:35:28.784 --> 00:35:33.304
darkness can, cannot enter into light, it runs away.

00:35:49.364 --> 00:35:55.404
Alright, now better we have our realization, is a better thing to do.

00:36:03.224 --> 00:36:06.324
I'll get up to tell them.

00:36:08.204 --> 00:36:15.484
You all have to take out your shoes. I'm happy you all have already done it. Is very good because, as I told you, the elements have to help us

00:36:15.724 --> 00:36:21.584
so the Mother Earth helps us a lot. Especially, this Kundalini is placed in the triangular bone

00:36:21.844 --> 00:36:27.704
which we call as the Mooladhara, is the, is the support, support of the root

00:36:28.064 --> 00:36:34.424
and the center below that is the Mooladhara chakra, is the, is the center of the support of the root

00:36:35.204 --> 00:36:42.364
and is made from the same element, the earth element and that's why the Mother Earth helps us a lot

00:36:42.664 --> 00:36:47.124
when we put our feet on Her with respect, with respect.

00:36:47.364 --> 00:36:54.004
Now put your feet on the Mother Earth, parallel ways, because we are made of two types of

00:36:54.264 --> 00:37:01.704
personalities, one is the left, another is the right. So what we have to do, is to keep them parallel, whichever way is the problem

00:37:01.944 --> 00:37:07.424
passes out to the Mother Earth and then you have to put both the hands towards Me just like this.

00:37:10.644 --> 00:37:15.904
After that you have to close your eyes, just close your eyes.

00:37:16.124 --> 00:37:23.564
And to remember that your right hand is for action and left hand is for desire.

00:37:23.864 --> 00:37:31.444
So you put your left hand all the time towards Me like this on your lap - you have to be comfortable so that you are not disturbed.

00:37:32.004 --> 00:37:37.124
Put the left hand and now right hand you put it on your heart

00:37:43.044 --> 00:37:49.244
and close your eyes. Whatever we have to do, we will do with our right hand on the left hand side

00:37:49.624 --> 00:37:54.304
and that's very simple which I will tell you one after another. Keep your eyes shut.

00:37:54.504 --> 00:38:01.304
Please don't open your eyes. If you open your eyes, the Kundalini will go back so please keep your eyes completely shut.

00:38:06.724 --> 00:38:14.744
[SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS TO SOME YOGI ASIDE - UNCLEAR]

00:38:19.104 --> 00:38:23.884
Now, you put your right hand on your heart where resides

00:38:24.724 --> 00:38:28.884
your Spirit - Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty

00:38:29.404 --> 00:38:35.924
and the Holy Ghost is the reflection of the Primordial Mother, His power.

00:38:36.404 --> 00:38:41.884
So now what you have to do, is to bring forth the yoga of this - the union of these two.

00:38:42.144 --> 00:38:48.164
You have to say, assert in your heart or ask Me a question, a simple question three times,

00:38:48.564 --> 00:38:54.404
"Mother, am I the Spirit, Mother, am I the Spirit,

00:38:54.964 --> 00:38:57.924
Mother, am I the Spirit?"

00:39:10.804 --> 00:39:18.364
Hmmm, now on the left-hand side again. You must know that as,

00:39:18.904 --> 00:39:25.604
you can ask this question about the Spirit, you have to know also that you are

00:39:26.584 --> 00:39:34.364
your own master because if you are the Spirit, you are your own master - you don't need anybody to tell you

00:39:34.724 --> 00:39:42.164
so you have to ask second question by putting right-hand on the upper part of the stomach, on the upper part of the stomach.

00:39:44.504 --> 00:39:52.024
You have to ask the question by putting your right-hand on the upper part of the stomach and say, "Mother,

00:39:56.164 --> 00:40:00.984
am I my own guru?" Please ask this question three times.

00:40:01.364 --> 00:40:06.704
"Mother, am I my own guru, Mother, am I my own guru?"

00:40:19.784 --> 00:40:27.444
Now, three times asking this question, you put down your right hand down below on the stomach,

00:40:27.684 --> 00:40:33.964
on the left-hand side. Please don't open your eyes, put it on the left-hand side. Here -

00:40:39.404 --> 00:40:43.384
on the left-hand side - now here you have to ask a question

00:40:51.484 --> 00:40:55.764
"Mother, can I be initiated?"

00:40:57.484 --> 00:41:00.484
Ask a question within yourself, three times.

00:41:01.224 --> 00:41:06.244
"Mother, can I be initiated?" without feeling guilty, three times.

00:41:11.504 --> 00:41:17.544
Now I say, "Yes," so to initiate yourself

00:41:18.824 --> 00:41:23.784
you ask, you say, "Mother, please teach me,

00:41:24.724 --> 00:41:29.984
please give me the knowledge of the Divine.

00:41:30.564 --> 00:41:38.224
Please give me the true knowledge, please give me the pure knowledge." That's what you have to ask because I cannot force it upon you,

00:41:38.524 --> 00:41:41.884
you have to ask for it. Please put the hand.

00:41:56.384 --> 00:42:03.744
Now, six times because there are six petals. Hmm

00:42:25.784 --> 00:42:28.784
Now raise this hand higher

00:42:29.844 --> 00:42:36.864
again on to the same stomach point where I told you is the center of the Primordial master.

00:42:37.824 --> 00:42:44.064
Press it hard here now on the stomach on the left hand side in the upper part of the abdomen.

00:42:45.104 --> 00:42:51.484
Here you ask Me a question, "Mother,"

00:42:55.544 --> 00:43:03.544
as you have asked Me already, "Am I my own guru?" You can say without asking a question, with full

00:43:04.064 --> 00:43:09.064
asserting, with full right, with full confidence,

00:43:10.724 --> 00:43:18.784
"Mother, I am my own master. " Please say it ten times, "Mother, I am my own master."

00:43:45.104 --> 00:43:48.044
Hmmm

00:43:55.524 --> 00:44:01.644
Just now we can have it, just now we should have it [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:03.964 --> 00:44:07.124
Now, raise your right hand on your heart.

00:44:09.024 --> 00:44:14.704
Here resides your Spirit and here you have to say with full assertion

00:44:19.024 --> 00:44:26.384
"Mother, I am the Spirit," you have to say twelve times because there are twelve petals to this beautiful center of heart.

00:44:26.904 --> 00:44:31.744
"Mother, I am the Spirit," please say it ten times.

00:44:34.544 --> 00:44:39.104
Hmm. Please don't feel guilty,

00:44:39.744 --> 00:44:44.064
please don't feel guilty, please don't feel guilty.

00:44:45.584 --> 00:44:51.204
You must know that God Almighty is the ocean of love,

00:44:52.944 --> 00:45:00.944
is the ocean of compassion and last of all He is the ocean, ocean of forgiveness

00:45:01.564 --> 00:45:08.204
so don't feel guilty, don't judge yourself - you have to achieve your glory by understanding that you're glorious

00:45:08.704 --> 00:45:13.524
so don't have any diffidence, just say with full confidence,

00:45:13.884 --> 00:45:17.584
"Mother, I am the Spirit."

00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:34.664
Now, again don't feel guilty, please don't feel guilty - is the biggest catch

00:45:34.944 --> 00:45:38.964
and don't feel guilty, is wrong to feel guilty,

00:45:42.464 --> 00:45:47.104
is harmful, is self destructive - don't feel guilty for anything.

00:45:49.724 --> 00:45:55.084
Now raise your hand on to the base of the neck,

00:45:57.204 --> 00:46:04.924
on the left-hand side, take it backwards a little bit, press it hard and here you have to say -

00:46:06.124 --> 00:46:13.704
press it hard at the back, take it at the back little bit, yes furthermore, furthermore, yeah.

00:46:15.404 --> 00:46:23.084
Press it hard, hold it hard. Here is the center when you feel guilty, it gets caught up.

00:46:24.604 --> 00:46:31.584
So now, sixteen times you have to say, "Mother I'm not guilty, I'm not guilty, I'm not guilty,"

00:46:31.824 --> 00:46:36.304
and if you are indulging too much into this kind of a thing and still you believe

00:46:36.704 --> 00:46:42.564
that you are guilty then say it 108 times as a punishment.

00:46:47.564 --> 00:46:50.744
Hmmm, sixteen times,

00:46:58.404 --> 00:47:01.444
sixteen times.

00:47:18.544 --> 00:47:25.844
Hmmm, now take this hand on your forehead

00:47:26.864 --> 00:47:32.964
across - this hand, right hand, left hand towards Me - on your forehead across, forehead -

00:47:33.984 --> 00:47:41.524
forehead is where My red mark is - across, left hand towards Me.

00:47:43.084 --> 00:47:51.044
Now, here is the center of Lord Jesus Christ so you have to say, "Mother, please

00:47:54.484 --> 00:47:57.684
I want to forgive everyone,

00:47:59.024 --> 00:48:05.484
I want to forgive everyone, I forgive everyone, " say it from your heart. It's a myth

00:48:05.724 --> 00:48:11.104
not to forgive, it's a myth because when you don't forgive, what are you doing

00:48:13.004 --> 00:48:19.304
and when you forgive also what are you doing? It's a myth, get over it. Just say, "I forgive everyone,"

00:48:19.924 --> 00:48:23.424
you can say, "Shri Mataji, I forgive everyone."

00:48:25.744 --> 00:48:31.604
Now, say it from your heart, don't feel guilty, please don't feel guilty.

00:48:32.204 --> 00:48:35.784
If you're feeling guilty, then is will not work out.

00:48:39.224 --> 00:48:42.664
You may put your hand at the back of your head,

00:48:43.604 --> 00:48:48.764
back of your head, without feeling guilty, you have to say

00:48:50.484 --> 00:48:56.104
"O Lord, if I've done any mistakes, please forgive me," but not to feel guilty, again I say.

00:48:56.564 --> 00:49:01.824
"If I have done any mistakes knowingly, unknowingly, please forgive me."

00:49:08.724 --> 00:49:11.784
Again feeling guilty

00:49:14.484 --> 00:49:22.524
Just say, "Please forgive me," He is the ocean of forgiveness - don't have to bother much about it. Now -

00:49:23.884 --> 00:49:31.144
left Vishuddhi is there - please don't feel guilty, still catching on that center.

00:49:32.844 --> 00:49:40.304
Alright, now put your right hand on top of your head at the fontanel bone area. Place your

00:49:42.204 --> 00:49:49.964
palm hard on the center of the head and try to move your head in a way

00:49:51.344 --> 00:49:57.504
it is clockwise. Try to move your scalp pressing hard with your palm.

00:49:58.124 --> 00:50:01.604
At this point again I cannot cross your freedom

00:50:02.624 --> 00:50:08.684
so you have to say, "Mother, I want my realization, please give me my realization."

00:50:08.884 --> 00:50:14.084
Please say this seven times because there are seven seats of all the centers.

00:50:23.384 --> 00:50:29.524
Hmmm. [SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

00:51:08.484 --> 00:51:13.524
Now put down your hand, don't open your eyes please.

00:51:15.464 --> 00:51:21.184
Put left hand on top of your head and see if there's a cool breeze coming in.

00:51:21.484 --> 00:51:26.844
Just put  your left hand on top of your head. See if there's a cool breeze coming in.

00:51:37.084 --> 00:51:41.244
Just feel it, little bit raise higher, raise higher,

00:51:41.644 --> 00:51:45.664
move it forward, backward - see now if there's a cool breeze coming in.

00:51:56.604 --> 00:52:00.924
Move on this side, I think. Take it on this side.

00:52:06.104 --> 00:52:12.384
Is it coming, cool breeze? Say those it is coming.

00:52:15.684 --> 00:52:18.764
Yes coming, alright, good idea.

00:52:23.544 --> 00:52:30.324
- Is it coming? Say loudly.
- Yes, Mother.
- It's good!

00:52:31.784 --> 00:52:37.204
Now ask the question by putting left hand towards Me and right hand on top of your head

00:52:38.884 --> 00:52:43.344
Ask a question, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

00:52:51.164 --> 00:52:54.564
You'll get it more - three times.

00:52:57.324 --> 00:53:04.484
Put your hands up all those who are feeling it also. Put up your hands, now open your eyes,

00:53:04.744 --> 00:53:08.584
watch Me without thinking. Put up your hands like this and ask a question,

00:53:09.804 --> 00:53:16.524
ask a question in your heart, "Is this the breeze of the Holy Ghost, is this the Chaitanya?

00:53:16.804 --> 00:53:21.744
Is this the Brahm, is this the All-Pervading power of God, is this?

00:53:24.724 --> 00:53:32.084
- Do you feel more when you ask questions? Yes, say it loudly.
- Yes.

00:53:35.504 --> 00:53:41.784
Haan, good! Now in your hands you see yourself.

00:53:44.864 --> 00:53:47.884
Better now, in the hands?

00:53:53.264 --> 00:54:00.464
Those who are feeling the cool breeze, raise your hands all of you - both your hands. All those who are feeling the cool breeze, raise your hands

00:54:02.064 --> 00:54:08.804
Just... It's great! Is great.

00:54:10.004 --> 00:54:15.984
Keep it this side also, keep your hands up, I would like to see who are getting the cool breeze - higher.

00:54:16.504 --> 00:54:22.564
Good! You didn't feel it? You will, very soon.

00:54:25.104 --> 00:54:29.784
May God bless you! Now, alright? Not yet?

and this is the very crucial time for you - say the first one month.

If you could work it out for a month properly, I'm sure you all can be masters - is not much.
