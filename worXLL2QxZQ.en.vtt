00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:13.349
…English, in the sense that we sat down
together and translated Sanskrit puja into

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:33.820
English and tried to make it more understandable
by you people.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:59.000
It’s the day of Mahalakshmi puja they say,
not only of Lakshmi Puja.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:10.820
There’s a difference between the two.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:21.770
Mahalakshmi is one of the powers of the three
powers, main powers, of Adi Shakti.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.490
As you know: Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:42.530
Now these powers have powers at a material
level also, at a subtler level also.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:02:00.570
So Mahalakshmi power is achieved after Lakshmi
power, as they say.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.340
So the Lakshmi…there are eight powers of
Lakshmi.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:15.939
This Lakshmi was born, who came out of the
sea, the great sea, which was churned thousands

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.040
and thousands of years back.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.340
And She came out of the sea because She is
the daughter of the sea.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.019
That’s why She’s called as Neeraja.

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.530
‘Neera’ means ‘water’ and ‘ja’
means ‘born out of’.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:43.239
This has happened thousands and thousand [of]
years back that She was born.

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.249
So what is that?

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:53.049
What is this Lakshmi symbolically, what is
it expressing?

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.049
It is expressing the awareness.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:59.450
Lakshmi expresses awareness, and She came
out of the sea, you know that.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.980
The awareness first started growing in the
sea.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.999
The life started existing in the sea, to begin
with, and then it grew out.

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:16.319
Without the life there is no awareness.

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:24.629
First the life, because everything is jada
(inanimate matter), everything is dead.

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.790
And when it becomes life it means it has awareness.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.169
So the awareness started growing in the sea.

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.840
This is the symbolic expression.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.000
In the gross level you can understand this
way.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.290
But actually in the subtle level, it is the
other way round.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.719
And because we see things from the gross level,
we say that, that is symbolic.

00:03:51.719 --> 00:04:01.650
But actually from the other side if you say,
“This is symbolic.”

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.542
Do you understand this point?

00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:12.709
So for me it is symbolic to see how the life
came into being in the sea and that it became

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:13.709
aware.

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:14.709
For me it is symbolic.

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:20.440
And for you it is symbolic the other way round.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.120
I mean if I see something from this side,
I see this way and while you see from that

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.230
side you see this way.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:42.160
To understand this, if you want to paint something
on a glass, how do you paint it on the glass?

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.160
Have you any idea?

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.320
You start painting first the outermost things
that you have to paint.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:55.569
For example if you are painting the Goddess,
first you will paint Her ornaments, then Her

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.940
sari, then Her body.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.900
Like that it will be moving deeper from this
side, if you are painting it on the glass,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.490
because you have to see it from the other
side.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:16.392
But supposing you have to paint it on a canvas,
you’ll paint it the other way round.

00:05:16.392 --> 00:05:21.419
You first paint the body, then the sari and
then the ornaments.

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:29.110
So to one thing it is symbolic because they
think this goes from their angle.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:37.220
To the other person who is from the other
angle this is absolutely symbolic.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:53.240
And it’s surprising that everything is so
symbolic and so much just

00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:15.039
the same that, whatever you may say, the subtle
remains subtle and the gross remains gross.

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:42.810
The one who is at the subtle level sees the
gross as a symbolic expression of the subtle.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:07:23.870
Now She was born in the sea.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.969
She was called as Neeraja.

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:29.740
She was born in the sea.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:34.680
Or Nira, that means ‘water’.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:46.009
My name is, one of them is, Nira as you know.

00:07:46.009 --> 00:08:20.500
Out of Nirmala one name is Nira, Nima and
Nira, like that I have got three names, four

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:27.629
names I should say.

00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:36.560
The big one is Nirmala.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.389
So this Nira part means what?

00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:47.100
That She was born in the sea.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.880
The name of Mary is also the same.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:09:07.680
Maryam or Mary, I don’t know how you say
in English.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:12.750
But Maryam this comes from ‘marine’.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.019
The word ‘marine’.

00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:20.490
‘Marine’ itself comes from the word Mary.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:35.070
So this Mahalakshmi, Mary, is named and She
is because She was born in the sea and that’s

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:39.170
how Her name was Mary.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:49.830
Mariana they call Her, some people call Her
Mariana, sometime call Her Miriam.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:58.830
All these words are indicating that She was
born in the sea.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:01.640
So She is Mahalakshmi.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:06.990
Now Mary is Mahalakshmi and Ganesha is the
child.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:21.921
Now see how symbolically it works, that only
in Diwali the Lakshmi and the Ganesha are

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:32.160
worshipped, only these two personalities.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:40.370
Can you understand that?

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:55.410
The symbol of Mahalakshmi, for me, is Mary.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:01.490
For you it is Mahalakshmi is the symbol.

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.490
And the symbol of Ganesha outside is Christ.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.490
He is symbolising Ganesha.

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:08.649
So, both of them are worshipped only on a
Diwali day.

00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:19.670
So actually this is the Christmas.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:45.649
This is the real Christmas that was before
also, and this was the time baby Christ was

00:11:45.649 --> 00:11:47.970
born, not the 25th of December.

00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:54.230
Though it’s a misunderstanding, doesn’t
matter, keep it up.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:57.699
Doesn’t matter, whenever He’s born.

00:11:57.699 --> 00:12:08.579
Because there used to be a very big festival,
and after the festival He was born.

00:12:08.579 --> 00:12:11.339
It’s called as Valanan.

00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:16.010
I don’t know what you call in modern times.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:19.269
That time it was called like that.

00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:33.950
And then this child was born and that was
the time Christmas was celebrated.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:51.620
It was just tallying with that, but somehow
it shifted.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:13:03.829
I don’t know how, how it shifted.

00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:17.760
And there might be somewhere you will find
out that the real Christmas was shifted.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:23.480
Gavin Brown: Yes it was.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.770
That’s known.

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:30.350
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:46.391
And symbolically in this lifetime also, in
the Kali Yuga also, same thing happens that

00:13:46.391 --> 00:14:03.560
Mahalakshmi and Ganesha were born, and that’s
why they are worshipped.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:23.290
Now you ask anyone, why Ganesha and Mahalakshmi
are worshipped, after all, on a Diwali day?

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:29.390
And it was the darkest night.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:42.029
It was the darkest night, and that night a
star was there.

00:14:42.029 --> 00:15:02.279
And because it was such a dark night that
star was very much noticed by everyone.

00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:24.100
It was a cold night, very cold night, and
a dark night.

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:33.329
So the symbol of Diwali is very great for
Sahaj Yogis.

00:15:33.329 --> 00:15:54.350
First of all you have to know there are four
days that are celebrated in Diwali.

00:15:54.350 --> 00:16:15.410
But there is one more day added to it in Maharashtra.

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:41.650
The first day of Diwali is called as Dhanatrayodashi:
is the thirteenth day of the moon.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:17:00.529
Because that day is the first day when Lakshmi,
the first one, was born on the thirteenth

00:17:00.529 --> 00:17:02.670
day.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:09.980
That means She was born as a Gruhalakshmi,
as a housewife.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:18.039
Now there are eight Lakshmis, which she will
read it out.

00:17:18.039 --> 00:17:22.790
And I will tell you later on what is the meaning
of them.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:24.740
One of them is Gruhalakshmi.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:34.120
So the first is the form of a Gruhalakshmi.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:46.070
She is born as a Gruhalakshmi to begin with.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:18:02.530
That means the awareness of human beings also,
started really getting into evolutionary process

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:06.940
when they started their family life.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:19.710
When they were vagabonds moving about, then
the awareness was just like animals.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:27.350
Though they had become human beings, but they
were like animals.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:34.670
Then when they established their families,
then the Gruhalakshmi started working and

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:42.409
that’s how the first advent of Gruhalakshmi
was felt.

00:18:42.409 --> 00:18:50.520
So She’s the first Lakshmi who was born,
and that’s why on that thirteenth day is

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.620
the day of the Gruhalakshmi, of the housewife.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:19:16.490
And so one has to go in the market and buy
some utensils or something that she uses for

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:25.090
cooking in the house.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:37.390
In India on the thirteenth day everyone goes
and buys a pot or, we can say, what you call,

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:41.340
a cooking utensil or something.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:54.539
Or they may buy a sari or something or gold
or something for the Gruhalakshmi.

00:19:54.539 --> 00:20:01.470
That is the day of the household.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:21.539
So, to reach the Lakshmi one has to understand
that motherhood is very important.

00:20:21.539 --> 00:20:27.450
The motherhood, as a Gruhalakshmi is important.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:42.550
Then the second day is even more important
because Narakasura was killed.

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:51.900
Horrible Narakasura, as you know him.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:21:03.670
But actually that day many rakshasas are killed
in many…

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:09.090
That’s a day fixed for killing rakshasas!

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:16.679
And then they are put in the hell.

00:21:16.679 --> 00:21:28.770
On the fourteenth day they are put in the
hell.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:33.200
So that’s called as Naraka Chaturdashi.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:48.560
That is the day when the hell is opened out.

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:55.679
That day Sahaja Yogis are supposed to sleep
in the night while everybody does all kinds

00:21:55.679 --> 00:22:00.870
of tantrikavidya and all that on the fourteenth
day.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:06.100
Then the fifteenth is that darkest night.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.760
That’s the darkest night when there is no
moon.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:17.740
Absolutely that’s the day when they celebrate
Deepawali, Diwali day.

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:32.660
But symbolically, in India also, Shri Rama
returned to his place (Ayodhya) on that day

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:47.080
and was crowned on that day.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:23:01.900
So the significance of Diwali is expressed
in this manner: that this is the day when

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:20.980
Narakasura, and all of them are killed, they
have all gone to Narak, they have gone to

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:29.310
the hell, and the people now are saved from
them and they are celebrating the joy.

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:35.490
And that is the time when Christ was born.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:48.370
That’s why lights are to be put in the night,
because He was born at twelve o’clock in

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:49.990
the night.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:24:04.170
So the next day to that, is the day [which]
is celebrated in India only in Maharashtra.

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:10.660
I don’t know [if] people celebrate otherwise.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.440
I don’t know.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:22.050
Shri Mataji: Do you celebrate the next day?

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:26.850
Yogini: The next day?

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:36.559
Shri Mataji: That’s the first day of the
moon.

00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:54.600
That is the forefathers of your Mother, Shalivahanas,
they started a calendar, from that date.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:25:11.710
And so on the first [day], that means the
first day of the moon, the new year is celebrated

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.230
here.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:24.600
Now see symbolically, Christ is born and a
new year is celebrated the next day.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:35.880
As soon as He is born the new year should
start.

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:41.880
So next year it starts, the new year.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:49.200
That is a new year in many parts of our country
where Shalivahana ruled there.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:54.570
The Shalivahana was my forefather, I should
say, they were just a dynasty.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:58.600
And this dynasty ruled in India since very
long.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:06.370
Even in the old puranas it is written that
they helped Krishna in their war.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:10.980
You know all the story about Shalivahana,
quite a lot.

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:16.090
And so the new year starts.

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:23.980
So for us that is the new year.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:35.890
For Sahaj Yogis that is the new year and you
have to accept it.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:42.700
And your Mother is of that dynasty.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:55.500
I mean no force on you but if you like you
can have it.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:27:07.950
Then the second day is also very important:
is the second day [of] the moon.

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:17.049
That is [when] the moon came out of the sea.

00:27:17.049 --> 00:27:27.110
According to this mythology, the Lakshmi came
out of the sea and with Her this moon came

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:40.779
out, which was only a two day old moon, the
new moon but a two day old moon.

00:27:40.779 --> 00:28:03.200
And this was regarded as the brother of Lakshmi,
because they were born at the same time, from

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.090
the sea.

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:09.230
So He is the brother of Lakshmi.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:10.770
It’s all symbolic.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.809
It’s very, very symbolic.

00:28:12.809 --> 00:28:18.950
Now the Left Side belongs to Mahakali, and
a brother had to be on this side, on the Left

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:20.039
Side.

00:28:20.039 --> 00:28:28.610
But actually you will be amazed that He is
the brother of Lakshmi.

00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:33.340
He is not a brother of Mahakali.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:49.840
But because He’s the brother of Lakshmi
he is accepted as a brother of all the goddesses:

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:55.779
one brother for all of them.

00:28:55.779 --> 00:29:09.019
So He is the only brother, who is this moon.

00:29:09.019 --> 00:29:12.790
So He is your uncle, He is your maternal uncle.

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:14.010
It’s very interesting.

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:23.960
Because we have a special right on our maternal
uncle, we can always ask for His help.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:33.360
And it’s a big story about this churning
that took place that Shiva saw all the poison

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.679
also coming out.

00:29:36.679 --> 00:29:49.660
So He drank the poison because He was the
only one who could drink the poison.

00:29:49.660 --> 00:30:14.550
And He got so heated up in His head, in His
neck that He wanted something to cool Him.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:38.429
So He took to this moon and put it on His
head.

00:30:38.429 --> 00:30:42.410
So the crowning [of Shiva] is the moon.

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:51.010
Now if you see, on Monday is the day of Sahastrara.

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:58.730
Monday is the day of the Moon.

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:11.950
Monday is the day of Sahastrara because Sadashiva
has put it on His head.

00:31:11.950 --> 00:31:25.040
And that’s what people tease Him that, “Your
brother-in-law is sitting on your head!”

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.780
(laughing) It’s very interesting.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:34.410
It’s very symbolic for you — not for me,
but for you — that the brother-in-law is

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:35.410
sitting on the head.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:42.500
This brother-in-law is very important, and
if brother-in-law is in any way angry then

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:48.470
even Sadashiva has to think twice.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:32:02.380
An all very special relationship, which is
very sweet, and which is very expressive.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:11.490
And if you want to understand it, that your
brother-in-law — is a naughty little thing

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:14.100
— is the brother of the wife.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:44.929
If you have to keep your wife pleased, that
is the power, you have to keep the brother-in-law

00:32:44.929 --> 00:32:46.630
quite happy.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:55.980
So He said it’s better to keep him on His
head.

00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:06.950
If there’s a naughty child, what do you
do to a naughty child?

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:20.090
You put him up somewhere there so he doesn’t
move.

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:29.220
Always you take a child outside, you put him
out there.

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:40.049
And He is very dear to Sadashiva, who really
loves Him in a special way.

00:33:40.049 --> 00:34:22.760
And that day is the day when all the sisters
worship their brothers — it’s very important

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:27.530
it is.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:45.210
[On] Raksha Bandhan day they give a symbolic
expression to their desire that their brother

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:59.130
should be good, but on this day they worship
their brothers, they actually worship them.

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:25.120
They are invited at home, they are made to
sit on the special type of a seat, then also

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:32.080
aarti is done to them.

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:55.050
Sometimes if they are very small, younger
brothers, then they are even given bath nicely.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:36:17.360
If they are older brothers also they’ll
cover all their body, but water will be poured

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:36.620
on them as a symbol and they are given new
dresses to wear.

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:50.100
And very special food is cooked that day.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:37:29.410
And then they

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:36.350
are served special food ahead of their husbands.

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:45.540
Always husband is served first, but that day
a brother gets the food first.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:54.470
And then the brother-in-law is teased a lot,
and the younger brother-in-law teases his

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:57.870
sister’s husband.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:03.240
And it’s a very nice function.

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.510
It’s called as Bhau-Beej.

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:20.240
And that day the brother gives some things
to the sister as a present.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:32.880
He will give even if you don’t have anything,
you can give anything, whatever it is.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:44.800
But you give something as a symbol of your
love to your sister.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:50.350
And this day, today, is that day.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:55.950
It’s such a nice day to do puja.

00:38:55.950 --> 00:39:03.120
This is the day when we all adjust together.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:07.150
But for a Gruhalakshmi, the brother is very
important.

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:18.500
And the brotherhood and sisterhood is the
base of our Sahaj Yoga collectivity.

00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:38.230
If you understand that brotherhood and sisterhood
is love which is very pure.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:44.980
There is no expectation.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:50.040
It’s just love.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:40:00.160
It’s giving love and taking love.

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:21.480
And absolute purity within us should exist
between our relationships when we call them

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:30.100
as Sahaj Yogi brothers and sisters.

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:51.650
And as there is understanding, complete understanding,
between the brother and sister in a family,

00:40:51.650 --> 00:41:07.620
one has to know we are all part and parcel
of a family, born of the same Mother.

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:17.650
Nobody has to shoot off or nobody has to become
something great, nobody has to correct others,

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:21.770
nobody has to say that, “I’m something
unique!”

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:56.300
All of you have to work it out together and
find out a solution working out together in

00:41:56.300 --> 00:42:06.440
complete friendship and unison.

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:32.420
Anyone who cuts off himself and goes out or
becomes anything else, goes out of circulation

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:36.120
and is useless for Sahaj Yoga.

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:39.760
Such a person is completely useless!

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:56.340
The one who tries to get out of the family.

00:42:56.340 --> 00:43:16.090
All of you have to be supporting each other,
helping to each other, not shouting at each

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:45.740
other or getting angry with each other; trusting
each other, not finding faults; treating each

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:52.010
other with respect and love.

00:43:52.010 --> 00:45:01.780
This is the most important thing the Sahaj
Yogis don’t understand — that

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:26.140
you are saints and
you have to respect each other.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:34.420
For example, you cannot doubt each other,
you cannot.

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:39.030
That’s not allowed, it’s prohibited.

00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:46.430
You are not to doubt each other.

00:45:46.430 --> 00:46:08.640
Here where, I would say that: if somebody
slaps you on one cheek, turn the other.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:13.040
That will work out here.

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:24.080
In this Sahaj Yoga one has to do it.

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:48.620
Not to criticise anyone, not to put down anyone.

00:46:48.620 --> 00:47:07.530
You are all Saints, why don’t you recognise
it?

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:14.670
How can you insult a saint?

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:26.160
You are men of God, do you realise that?

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:41.780
How can you put down anyone and say, “They
are not good,” and, “They are good”?

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:55.760
If you start doing that, somebody else will
take advantage of you

00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:45.360
and will really push you down and you will
be in very great trouble.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:49:19.040
Never get into such funny ideas, that you
are better than the others, that you can do

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:23.040
better than the others.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:32.830
The one who starts doing the better is doing
the greatest harm.

00:49:32.830 --> 00:49:40.280
There is no competition in Sahaj Yoga.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:46.680
Give up this idea of competition.

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:48.910
You are brothers and sisters.

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:59.310
You have to support each other, help each
other.

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:11.870
Anybody is going down, try to work out on
them.

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:18.340
If you find somebody is going down too much
beat him with shoes.

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:31.950
But anybody who thinks he is very great, he
has this special quality or that quality:

00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:43.660
supposing somebody thinks he is very neat,
he should hang himself by the nearest tree!

00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:47.010
That’s what I sometimes feel.

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:57.920
Because on this point there are so many quarrels
going on!

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:22.690
But somebody who thinks he has a right to
be untidy also should hang himself by the

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:25.790
nearest tree!

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:44.370
And should know that, “I’m making an inconvenience
of myself to others.”

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:49.020
You must respect!

00:51:49.020 --> 00:52:48.030
If there is no mutual respect, this brother
and sister relationship is not there.

00:52:48.030 --> 00:53:16.240
It’s a very sweet relationship which you
have not enjoyed unfortunately.

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:20.210
But in India we have.

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:27.370
Our brothers will give up their lives for
us.

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:34.530
And we will give our lives for our brothers.

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:55.560
And our brothers have so much faith in us
that if we tell them that, “You should not

00:53:55.560 --> 00:54:14.050
do this!” they know that this we are doing
only just to help him out, not to show off

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:23.500
our great importance or giving a big sermon,
but it is just because we love him.

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:35.960
The love is so established and if that love
is not established, what are you showing off

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:36.960
about?

00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:47.460
Today is, in a way, a very great year, in
the brothers and sisters relationship.

00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:49.200
How do you express your brothers and sisters
relationship?

00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:52.840
I do not like to hear complaints, but I see
that it is full of ego.

00:54:52.840 --> 00:55:07.160
The reason is, people are behaving in such
a manner that I cannot understand that you

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:08.190
are saints!

00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:10.120
What has happened to you?

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.120
How can you be individualistic?

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:12.120
I’ll give you a simple example: we have
got in our house some sort of plants, which

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.030
could only grow inside the house, but when
it was summertime, we put them outside and

00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:16.370
they were growing well.

00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:23.990
But when the winter came in suddenly one night
they all became absolutely dead you can call

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.990
it.

00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:25.990
So, the servant got upset he said, “What
to do now?”

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.990
I said, “You bring them inside!”

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.990
Now he said, “They won’t grow.”

00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.990
I said, “They will.”

00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:29.990
I said, “You get four [or] five of them,
put them together in one thing.”

00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.990
And they started growing well.

00:55:30.990 --> 00:55:31.990
Because whatever is missing in one person,
you support from the another person.

00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:33.160
And this support is so natural and spontaneous
which flows.

00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:38.880
If you try to correct others then you are
draining out your energy and the energy of

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.180
another person.

00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:44.080
Just try to support that person.

00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:48.930
That’s how it works out.

00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:50.250
And that’s how it sustains, it’s nourishing.

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:55.820
I mean it’s an experiment you can try also,
at home.

00:55:55.820 --> 00:56:12.320
If you put four five trees together when they
are in delicate condition they grow better.

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:13.878
Why, when we grow our saplings we put them
together?

00:56:13.878 --> 00:56:14.878
Why don’t we put them separate?

00:56:14.878 --> 00:56:31.730
You see, when we have got a small seed and
we have to make them into saplings, we never

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:40.060
put them separately we put them together,
in a small block.

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:45.960
If you put them separately they will never
come up.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:49.210
Then they are kept in that condition together,
till they grow.

00:56:49.210 --> 00:56:53.320
When they are grown, then only they are taken
from that collective group and put separately.

00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:54.510
Have you not seen this happening?

00:56:54.510 --> 00:56:57.290
And this is what is collectivity.

00:56:57.290 --> 00:57:03.020
At the delicate point when Sahaj Yoga is coming
up, we have to be much more closer together.

00:57:03.020 --> 00:57:09.870
Later on when you are very powerful it’s
all right because you will have greater rapport.

00:57:09.870 --> 00:58:29.870
But it’s such a vicious circle that at this
time when you are weak you are also falling

00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:33.430
off.

00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:37.710
And this collectivity is all-embracing.

00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:45.240
Of course these are due to your ego, superego,
whatever problems.

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:49.960
But only together you are going to be.

00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:55.410
But I have seen, when you are mesmerised,
you fall in love with each other, absolutely:

00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:57.230
when you are mesmerised.

00:58:57.230 --> 00:59:01.390
But when there is freedom, you cannot enjoy
your collectivity.

00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:02.720
In freedom people find it very difficult:
then somebody behaves like an ascetic, some

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:05.180
behaves like a madcap, somebody behaves like
a hot-tempered fellow, another behaves like

00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:06.180
a city consul.

00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:07.180
I don’t know.

00:59:07.180 --> 00:59:12.990
When it is freedom you do not grow in a healthy
way together.

00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:15.030
You must know there must be something within
you which is keeping you out from collectivity.

00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:17.720
At this stage the best thing is to surrender
and beat yourself with shoes.

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:19.490
Any such ideas come into your head you just
do that way.

00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:20.490
That’s the way it will work out.

00:59:20.490 --> 00:59:21.720
Today is the day you have to promise, today,
here.

00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:23.910
Shri Mataji: Where is Cooly?

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:25.660
I can’t see him.

00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:26.970
Is he there?

00:59:26.970 --> 00:59:29.460
Yogini: He wasn’t allowed to come, Mother.

00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:30.460
Shri Mataji: Hmm?

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:31.460
He’s not come

00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.430
Yogi: I think you said he wasn’t allowed
to come, Mother.

00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:35.730
Shri Mataji: He’s not come?

00:59:35.730 --> 00:59:37.400
Yogini: He wasn’t allowed to come, Mother.

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.260
Shri Mataji: He was not allowed?

00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:40.890
Yogi: I think you told him that he wasn’t
allowed.

00:59:40.890 --> 00:59:41.890
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:59:41.890 --> 00:59:42.890
I did say.

00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:43.890
I’m sorry.

00:59:43.890 --> 00:59:44.890
I did, I had to.

00:59:44.890 --> 00:59:45.890
Certain things had to be done.

00:59:45.890 --> 00:59:46.890
I am sorry.

00:59:46.890 --> 00:59:47.890
But you must know you are people who are chosen
specially.

00:59:47.890 --> 00:59:48.890
What prophecies are made for you if you read
that ‘Milton’ (by William Blake) you will

00:59:48.890 --> 00:59:49.890
know — the English people.

00:59:49.890 --> 00:59:50.890
What prophecies!

00:59:50.890 --> 00:59:51.890
“The Men of God will be there and they will
have their own heroes and they will not follow

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:52.890
these Romans and Greeks and their horrible
heroes.

00:59:52.890 --> 00:59:53.890
They’ll have their innocent heroes, and
all those things.”

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:54.890
And here I find that there’s a kind of a
passion for falling down.

00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:55.890
Keep together.

00:59:55.890 --> 00:59:56.890
Keep together.

00:59:56.890 --> 00:59:57.890
Love each other.

00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:58.890
Understand them.

00:59:58.890 --> 00:59:59.890
Love not of mesmerism, but of freedom.

00:59:59.890 --> 01:00:00.890
In freedom you must love each other.

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:01.890
I never take away your freedom, that’s one
thing, whether you fall or rise.

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:02.890
First thing is for your freedom.

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:03.890
That is the thing on which you are going to
move.

01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:04.890
So today is the day where you all have to
promise and pray that, this brotherhood and

01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:05.890
sisterhood will be established.

01:00:05.890 --> 01:00:06.890
Ask for it in this soil of England, this is
the Jerusalem.

01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:09.220
Ask for that, that this will be established
on the soil of Jerusalem.

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:24.680
That’s the most important thing.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:29.870
And you will be surprised that once this is
established, Lakshmi is established.

01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:30.870
Now Mahalakshmi has eight aspects.

01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:31.870
Now read about these eight aspects.

01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:32.870
How many there are, let us see!

01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:33.870
First follow!

01:00:33.870 --> 01:00:34.870
Yogini: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Adya Lakshmi
Namoh Namah.

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:35.870
Shri Mataji: Adya Lakshmi.

01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:36.870
Adya Lakshmi means Mahalakshmi.

01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:37.870
Adya Lakshmi.

01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:38.870
Adi, Adya.

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:42.470
Adya Lakshmi: that’s the first one.

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:48.460
You say now, you repeat it!

01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:55.210
Yogis: Om twameva Sakshat, Shri Adya Lakshmi
Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat, Shri Bhagawati

01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:59.070
Sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi, Namoh
Namaha.

01:00:59.070 --> 01:01:01.490
Shri Mataji: Now, second one.

01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:05.830
Yogini: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Vidya Lakshmi
Namoh Namah.

01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:09.500
Shri Mataji: Vidya – vidya is the art of
Sahaj Yoga, which you know.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.500
That is vidya.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.830
The rest is all avidya.

01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:19.300
How to raise the Kundalini; how to awaken
all the deities; how to cleanse yourself;

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.300
how to cleanse others.

01:01:21.300 --> 01:01:29.450
All the knowledge; all the science about that
is called as vidya: the Lakshmi of that.

01:01:29.450 --> 01:01:34.810
Lakshmi is the grace, is the grace.

01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:37.940
The awareness that is gracious.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:38.940
The awareness that is gracious.

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:42.080
So that Lakshmi should be with you, not only
to know the vidya, you know that, but to have

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.080
grace about it.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.350
The way people do things, for example: some
people will just go on.

01:01:44.350 --> 01:01:45.350
All that kind of a nonsense you do.

01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:47.100
Sometimes the way we go on working [on themselves],
and I’m giving a lecture and people are

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:48.100
just working out.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:49.100
All that is most disgraceful and disgracious
(ungracious).

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:52.720
So not to do these method of making the thing
look so disgracious.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:57.860
I mean you need not be serious people at all,
because Sahaj Yoga is not a serious thing.

01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:58.860
It is a play.

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:02.590
It is a play of grace.

01:02:02.590 --> 01:02:08.930
You have to be gracious; you are not to be
disgraceful, that’s very important.

01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:12.520
If you are disgraceful then your vidya is
useless.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.940
I have seen many people all the time doing
like this, doing like that; they think that

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:15.940
it’s their left hand job, you see, and they
have become now masters of this job.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:16.940
There’s no grace about it.

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:17.940
One has to see how to do it graciously.

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:18.940
Do you see your Mother, how She moves Her
hands and feet.

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:19.940
Not one day, one time, even in one action
you will find me doing something ungraceful

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:20.940
like that except when I copy you! (laughter)

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:21.940
So this is what it is, is the Vidya Lakshmi.

01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:22.940
Lakshmi is the grace to do everything.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:23.940
Come, second one, third.

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:24.940
Yogini: Om twameva Sakshat, Shri-

01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:25.940
Shri Mataji: …and now you could say it.

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:26.940
“Om twameva…”

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:27.940
Yogis: Om twameva sakshat, Shri Vidya Lakshmi
sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat, Shri Bhagawati

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:28.940
Sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi, Namoh
Namaha.

01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:29.940
Shri Mataji: For Left Swadhishthana you know
this is the Mantra.

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:30.940
Third One.

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:31.940
Yogini: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Saubhagya
Lakshmi Namoh Namah.

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:32.940
Shri Mataji: Sau-bha-gya, Saubhagya means
‘good fortune’.

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:33.940
The Lakshmi that gives you good fortune in
every way.

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:34.940
Like She gives you good fortune in money,
in your living, in your food, in every way.

01:02:34.940 --> 01:02:35.940
Any good fortune is given through God.

01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:36.940
It’s only God who gives good fortune.

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:37.940
If you get money say in the racecourse, that’s
bad fortune because that will be lost next

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:38.940
day or you will go to the pub to be free.

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:39.940
But if you get the real one, then you create
something out of it which is blissful and

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:40.940
great: is Saubhagya Lakshmi.

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:41.940
Now, say it.

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:42.940
Saubhagya Lakshmi.

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:43.940
Yogis: Om twameva sakshat, Shri Saubaghya
Lakshmi Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat,

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:44.940
Shri Bhagawati Sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri
Nirmala Devi, Namoh Namaha.

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:45.940
Shri Mataji: Amruta.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:46.940
Yogini: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Amrut Lakshmi
Namah.

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:47.940
Shri Mataji: Amruta.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:48.940
Amruta means the thing that does not die.

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:49.940
In this world the Lakshmi exists as your wealth.

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:50.940
Now the wealth that does not die, which is
that wealth?

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:51.940
Is the Spirit.

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:52.940
So the grace of the Spirit is the Amruta Lakshmi.

01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:53.940
Grace of the Spirit is the Amruta Lakshmi.

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.940
The rest of the things all will die out.

01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:55.940
And whatever is done through the Spirit, to
please the Spirit, is the Amruta Lakshmi,

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.940
for example: loving others.

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:57.940
Loving others has a different meaning in the
symbolic way as you people understand it.

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:58.940
Loving means giving; doing without any expectation.

01:02:58.940 --> 01:02:59.940
Just doing and enjoying it.

01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:00.940
The greatest is giving vibrations.

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:01.940
That is Amruta.

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:02.940
Vibrations do not die.

01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:03.940
That’s the Lakshmi of the Amruta.

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:04.940
Yogis: Om Twameva sakshat, Shri Amruta Lakshmi
Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat, Shri Bhagawati

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:05.940
Sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi, Namoh
Namaha.

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:06.940
Yogini: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Kaam Lakshmi…

01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:07.940
Shri Mataji: No, Gruhalakshmi!

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:08.940
You know that, Gruhalakshmi.

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:09.940
Yogis: Om twameva Sakshat, Shri Gruhalakshmi
Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat, Shri Bhagawati

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:10.940
Sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi, Namoh
Namaha”.

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:11.940
Shri Mataji: Ha.

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:12.940
Yogini: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Satya Lakshmi
Namah.

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:13.940
Shri Mataji: Sa-tya: [as] I told awareness.

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:14.940
She is the one who has given you awareness.

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:15.940
Awareness is Lakshmi’s character.

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:16.940
Satya means the truth.

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:17.940
As you rise in your awareness, you know the
truth.

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:18.940
Now what is the truth?

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:19.940
What is the truth?

01:03:19.940 --> 01:03:20.940
What are we aware of?

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:21.940
You are aware that you are the instrument
of God and that He is working through you.

01:03:21.940 --> 01:03:22.940
You are aware of that because it’s flowing
on your central nervous system.

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:23.940
This is the truth of which you have to be
aware.

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:24.940
What is the other truth?

01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:25.940
Is who are you?

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:26.940
That you are the Spirit.

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:27.940
And the third truth is, who am I?

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:28.940
And the fourth truth is who is God?

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:29.940
What is your destiny?

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:30.940
If they become your awareness, then you have
got Satya Lakshmi.

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:31.940
Say now.

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:32.940
Yogis: Om Twameva Sakshat, Shri Satya Lakshmi
Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat, Shri Bhagawati

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:33.940
Sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi, Namoh
Namaha.

01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:34.940
Yogini: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Bhogya Lakshmi
Namah.

01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:35.940
Shri Mataji: Mm?

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:36.940
Yogini: Bhogya Lakshmi.

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:37.940
Shri Mataji: Bhogya Lakshmi.

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:38.940
Bho-gya: ‘Bhoga’ means the one by which
you enjoy, by which you enjoy.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.940
I mean it’s like the whole ocean of joy
is around you and you are like a bird who

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:40.940
cannot drink it.

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:41.940
Only through the grace of Bhogya Lakshmi,
you can enjoy that.

01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:42.940
So the Spirit, though it is manifesting, you
are not enjoying your Spirit – even that.

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:43.940
Anything that you see — say you see a flower
— you should be able to enjoy.

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:44.940
You cannot enjoy because there is thought.

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:45.940
Anything you do [if] there is thought, you
cannot enjoy.

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:46.940
When the Spirit is flowing you get complete
enjoyment.

01:03:46.940 --> 01:03:47.940
Actually I should say, I am the enjoyer of
it.

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:48.940
Yogis: Om twameva Sakshat, Shri Bhogya Lakshmi
Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat, Shri Bhagawati

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:49.940
Sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi, Namoh
Namaha.

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:50.940
Yogini: Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Yoga Lakshmi
Namah.

01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:51.940
Shri Mataji: Yoga Lakshmi.

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:52.940
The Lakshmi’s power which gives you Yoga.

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:53.940
Lakshmi supports your power of yoga by giving
you awareness.

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:54.940
The power by which you take to yoga is all
combined as Yoga Lakshmi.

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:55.940
Like your affluence: you are not satisfied
and you want to have Yoga.

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:56.940
The dissatisfaction you get till you have
got yoga is coming from the Yoga Lakshmi.

01:03:56.940 --> 01:03:57.940
So Yoga Lakshmi is the power which gives you
or takes you to your grace, by which you go

01:03:57.940 --> 01:03:58.940
to yoga: that’s Yoga Lakshmi.

01:03:58.940 --> 01:03:59.940
Means the kind of a satisfaction that you
seek is manifested in you through this power

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:00.940
of Yoga Lakshmi.

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:01.940
And then once you have achieved your yoga,
you get the grace.

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:02.940
Lakshmi is the grace.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:03.940
So you get the grace of a saint.

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:04.940
You should have the grace of a saint.

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:05.940
You should look like a saint.

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:06.940
You are a saint.

01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:07.940
I think better write it on your mirrors, “We
are saints.

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:08.940
We are men of God.

01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:09.940
We have to behave like saints.

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:10.940
We are saints.”

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:11.940
You are, no doubt.

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.940
You are men of God, no doubt, but you have
to turn your faces this way.

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:13.940
So, this is the Yoga Lakshmi.

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:14.940
For example a person who has got Yoga Lakshmi
doesn’t quarrel like a madcap.

01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:15.940
If he quarrels or dominates someone in a foolish
way then he’s still lacking that Lakshmi

01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:16.940
point.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:17.940
There’s a grace about it, the whole way
of talking.

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:18.940
How you talk to a saint?

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:19.940
All right.

01:04:19.940 --> 01:04:20.940
Yogis: Om twameva Sakshat, Shri Yoga Lakshmi
Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat, Shri Bhagawati

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:21.940
Sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh
Namaha.

01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:22.940
Shri Mataji: So these are the eight-fold paths
by which one has to grace oneself.

01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:23.940
This is the attire of Sahaj Yogis.

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:24.940
And today you have asked for it.

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:25.940
May God give you that power.

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:26.940
One more thing I have to say just before we
start doing the thing [is] that around the

01:04:26.940 --> 01:04:27.940
Lakshmi you know is the Void.

01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:28.940
And though the Lakshmi in a situation where
there is negativity, She runs away, She is

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:29.940
frightened.

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:30.940
She is a frightened Deity.

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:31.940
She is very sensitive.

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:32.940
She doesn’t like any negativity.

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:33.940
As soon as the negativity comes in She runs
away.

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:34.940
In the same way those people, those great
saints who were born on the Void, have said

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:35.940
that, “Those people who try to frighten
Lakshmi are the people who are irreligious,”

01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:36.940
in the sense they drink.

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:37.940
Those people who drink, in the third generation
lose their Lakshmi completely.

01:04:37.940 --> 01:04:38.940
You can see the results now: those who used
to take one peg (30 ml of alcohol), now are

01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:39.940
sitting in the pub the whole night.

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:40.940
And that’s what it is that, once these things
enter into your family or household, they

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:41.940
start corroding your Lakshmi.

01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:42.940
That’s why we have to understand that Lakshmi
is very, very sensitive to this point.

01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:43.940
And Lakshmi is extremely sensitive to fanaticism,
extremely sensitive to fanaticism.

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:44.940
Any kind of fanatic ideas you have got, She
will run away.

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:45.940
She can’t stand fanaticism.

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:46.940
As soon as fanaticism will settle down into
any country, it will start becoming poorer

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:47.940
and poorer.

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:48.940
Any kind of fanaticism about religion is to
be avoided.

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:49.940
Now so many young people who are aware of
fanaticism because, thank God, there are some

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:50.940
horrible fanatics which have proved that fanaticism
is bad, and they are now coming round it.

01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:51.940
But when fanaticism works out, the expulsion
of all the powers of Lakshmi from within,

01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:52.940
that’s the sure and certain sign that you
really invite cancer, really invite cancer.

01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:53.940
Also alcohol does, but this is the triggering
point.

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:54.940
If an alcoholic is also a fanatic, it will
trigger much faster.

01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:55.940
Fanaticism is to be to be avoided like leprosy
for Sahaja Yogis.

01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:56.940
But not only that, we have to stand up in
a revolt against all kinds of fanaticism.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:57.940
Just this is the revolution against all fanaticism
of life.

01:04:57.940 --> 01:04:58.940
That’s very important for the establishment
of Shri Lakshmi.

01:04:58.940 --> 01:04:59.940
Any religion, any fanaticism that collides
with another religion or in any way belittles

01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:00.940
it — because all religions are just the
same of one God — belittles another religion

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:01.940
or insults anyone is absolutely against Lakshmi’s
Principle.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:02.940
So we go, after all this, when we rise above
this, we go to Mahalakshmi principle.

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:03.940
Now the awareness that was seeking up to Lakshmi
— means you achieve money, achieve position

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:04.940
for achieving grace, once you have achieved
the grace of this, you want to achieve God.

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:05.940
And this new awakening within you that you
have to achieve God now is the power of Mahalakshmi.

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:06.940
By the power of Mahalakshmi only, you achieve
your saintliness, your Realisation.

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:07.940
That’s why She came on this earth as the
Mother of Jesus Christ.

01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:08.940
That was Mahalakshmi, not Lakshmi but Mahalakshmi.

01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:09.940
May God bless you.

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:10.940
(Puja commences with discussion and mantras)

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:11.940
Gavin: gurushaya Namaha.

01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:12.940
Istadevata Namah, all those: that we do first.

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:13.940
Shri Mataji: All right.

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:14.940
All the names of the Gods or all the Deities.

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:15.940
Gavin: Om Shri Mahaganapati Namah

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:16.940
Shri Saraswati Mataya Namah

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:17.940

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:18.940
Vedapurushaya Namah

01:05:18.940 --> 01:05:19.940
Ishtadevatabhyo Namah

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:20.940

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:21.940
Sthandevatabhyo Namah

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:22.940
Shri Mataji: Sthanadevata!

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:23.940
Gavin: Gramdevatabhyo Namah

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:24.940
Vastudevatabhyo Namah

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:25.940
Shachipurandarabhyam Namoh

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:26.940
Kalkam Parashuramebhyo Namah

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:27.940
Matrupitrubhyam Namoh

01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:28.940
Adityadinavagrahadevatabhyo Namah

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:29.940
Sarvebhyo Devebhyo Namah

01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:30.940
Sarvebhyo Bhahmanebhyo Namah

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:31.940
Yetad Karma Pradhanadevatabhyo Namah

01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:32.940
Shri Mataji: Mmm, very good!

01:05:32.940 --> 01:05:33.940
All the Deities within you, see all the Deities
within you.

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:34.940
You see, all the deities within you have been
already…(Mother is interrupted)

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:35.940
Shri Mataji: Why is she taking?

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:36.940
Don’t do like that!

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:37.940
Yogi: It’s time to go and feed her soon.

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:38.940
Shri Mataji: Ha?

01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:39.940
Cover her head.

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:40.940
Don’t do like that.

01:05:40.940 --> 01:05:41.940
No no no no no Cover their heads, Jane what
are you doing?

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:42.940
Yogini: She was crying Mother.

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:43.940
I’m not sure, you know, whether she wants
feeding or changing.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:44.940
Shri Mataji: No no no.

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:45.940
Foment her stomach here..

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:46.940
Take her out.

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:47.940
She’ll be all right.

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:48.940
Don’t take her outside.

01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:49.940
Ha.

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:50.940
Give her here.

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:51.940
Shri Mataji: Ha.

01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:52.940
Let’s help her.

01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:53.940
Somebody can bring just a cheap little cloth
or something and a ??

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:54.940
Gavin: Then we make the dedication of saying
where is the puja is being held.

01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:55.940
So: on the ninth of November in the winter
season on the fifteenth night of the moon,

01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:56.940
when the sun in Tropic of Capricorn, we do
this puja…

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:57.940
Shri Mataji: Today is the second day of the
moon.

01:05:57.940 --> 01:05:58.940
Actually is the other week has started now.

01:05:58.940 --> 01:05:59.940
That date was fifteenth, but today is the
second day, second day of the moon.

01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:00.940
On the Shukla Paksha.

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:01.940
On the Shukla Paksha means when the moon is
going to become bigger.

01:06:01.940 --> 01:06:02.940
All of this is very important, is historical,
you see, that’s why it would be nice to

01:06:02.940 --> 01:06:03.940
say that.

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:04.940
Come along!

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:05.940
Gavin: We do this puja in Hampstead, in London,
in England, in Europe, in this world, on behalf

01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:06.940
of all Sahaj Yogis.

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:07.940
Shri Mataji: Ask you now…

01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:08.940
Has she got the flu.

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:08.943
Hand to Swadhishthan.
