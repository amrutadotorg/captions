18:05.987 --> 18:11.529
Now, what we can do is to, Philip,

18:11.654 --> 18:14.654
what should I tell you the practical side,

18:14.737 --> 18:16.987
the meditation. All right?

18:17.070 --> 18:23.237
Let’s see what this meditation is, what We have to do on a meditation.

18:25.946 --> 18:30.570
The first thing we have got is the left side

18:30.654 --> 18:36.654
is the Mana-Shakti, is the power of your emotions. All right?

18:36.737 --> 18:42.904
Now, emotions are connected with your right side, also – prana.

18:42.986 --> 18:45.487
Say for example if you are emotionally disturbed,

18:45.570 --> 18:48.070
just now we got disturbed,

18:48.153 --> 18:54.153
so our shva, our breathing also increased

18:54.237 --> 18:59.487
and we felt the whole body was sort of, say reacting

18:59.570 --> 19:05.987
and the, we were feeling the reaction of the Prana, right side also.

19:06.070 --> 19:08.112
That it was trying to express itself.

19:08.237 --> 19:12.153
Like we started the tears, is the water-element

19:12.237 --> 19:17.153
and all that came in and the whole emotion was so much pouring out

19:17.237 --> 19:25.195
and with that our Prana was also involved.

19:25.320 --> 19:28.696
Say for example if you are frightened,

19:28.821 --> 19:31.904
if you are frightened

19:31.986 --> 19:35.904
if you are frightened too much then what happens?

19:35.986 --> 19:39.862
If you are frightened than also you get your breathing

19:39.986 --> 19:41.028
very fast – isn’t it?

19:41.153 --> 19:44.153
So it is connected.

19:45.487 --> 19:48.862
So it is connected. If you are frightened it is connected

19:48.946 --> 19:52.737
with your Prana, in your breathing

19:52.821 --> 20:02.237
and your whole system is connected with your emotions, physical system.

20:02.986 --> 20:07.821
If you cry too much, or if you weep too much, or if you are a sad person

20:07.904 --> 20:10.946
that shows on your face, your Vishuddhi-Chakra also shows,

20:10.987 --> 20:13.487
and not only Anahata but also Vishuddhi.

20:13.570 --> 20:16.404
Then also your Agnya goes out.

20:16.487 --> 20:21.862
So all the Chakras reflect the left side

20:21.986 --> 20:24.904
in such a way that physical manifestation is also there.

20:24.986 --> 20:28.153
So it proofs that both are very much connected.

20:28.237 --> 20:33.946
So to, if you have to, somehow or other,

20:33.987 --> 20:36.986
dissolve these two sides within us,

20:37.070 --> 20:39.278
the left and the right side

20:39.404 --> 20:43.529
because if you do not dissolve it,  you are left half way here

20:43.654 --> 20:45.612
so you have to dissolve these two things.

20:45.737 --> 20:49.570
And to dissolve these, what should we do?

20:49.654 --> 20:53.904
What can we do – in meditation?

20:55.070 --> 20:57.487
Can you suggest?

21:00.404 --> 21:03.487
Say we have got Prana and Mana.

21:03.696 --> 21:10.445
Now Prana represents the right side and the Mana-Shakti is the left side.

21:10.654 --> 21:15.737
All right? These two have to be dissolved – in the air, means dissolved.

21:15.862 --> 21:19.362
Now how do we do it? To dissolve these two things,

21:19.487 --> 21:22.445
they are connected with each other.

21:24.362 --> 21:28.737
After realization, not before.

21:38.986 --> 21:43.570
So before meditation we give ourselves a balance, all right?

21:43.654 --> 21:46.821
This side is more, this side is less. At the time.

21:46.862 --> 21:49.487
Supposing you are emotionally – at that time – disturbed,

21:49.654 --> 21:52.070
then you put your right to the left.

21:52.237 --> 21:55.362
If you are that time disturbed on the left side

21:56.737 --> 22:01.946
I mean disturbed in that sense that if a left side is frozen,

22:02.070 --> 22:07.028
then you raise your left side and give yourself a balance before meditation.

22:07.237 --> 22:10.862
Now let us see, which side is less, first of all.

22:10.946 --> 22:15.195
Put your hands like that.

22:15.320 --> 22:19.987
Are you all right? Getting cool breeze? Getting it?

22:20.070 --> 23:04.821
(Shri Mataji speaks to a little girl)

23:09.987 --> 23:14.278
So once you have given yourself a balance

23:14.445 --> 23:22.404
then the best thing is to pay attention to your emotions,

23:22.529 --> 23:26.153
to Manas-Shakti. Watch them.

23:26.237 --> 23:33.195
You can enlighten your emotions by thinking of your Mother. All right.

23:33.278 --> 23:35.404
Just enlighten them.

23:35.487 --> 23:41.696
Just She will solve the problem. Whatever are the problems in the Mana, all right?

23:41.862 --> 23:48.404
So once you get connected with those emotions

23:48.529 --> 23:57.028
and you start looking at them in your meditation

23:58.278 --> 24:03.779
you will see these emotions are rising within you

24:04.529 --> 24:10.112
and if you try to put these emotions on your Mother,

24:10.195 --> 24:13.612
as they say at the Lotus-Feet of your Mother,

24:14.278 --> 24:18.696
they will start also dissolving those emotions

24:18.821 --> 24:27.237
and they’ll become sort of – ah – expanded. Expanded, you see.

24:27.320 --> 24:30.946
You will extern that in such a way that

24:30.987 --> 24:34.362
you will feel you are in control, these emotions.

24:34.487 --> 24:38.278
You are in control of them and by that controlling those emotions

24:38.904 --> 24:43.904
your emotions – which are expanded, enlightened – are powerful.

24:44.404 --> 24:50.737
And these emotions, when you feel that way,

24:50.946 --> 24:56.654
then the cause of those emotions can be solved.

24:56.946 --> 25:00.570
For example just now you got emotionally stirred up

25:00.654 --> 25:04.946
because I talked about – say – these children.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.986
Naturally, anybody would be.

25:07.987 --> 25:13.153
Now when you are stirred up with that you put that problem

25:13.278 --> 25:16.112
and those feelings that are rising in you,

25:16.278 --> 25:21.112
that those waves of feelings that are coming at the Lotus-Feet of your Mother.

25:21.654 --> 25:27.195
So they get touched, say by that power you can say.

25:27.320 --> 25:30.320
Then these emotions become enlightened

25:30.570 --> 25:33.570
and when these emotions become enlightened

25:33.654 --> 25:40.404
they have a power to solve the problem. Do you see the point?

25:40.487 --> 25:43.529
As if they had reached the shore where they got the light

25:43.612 --> 25:46.862
and this problem can be solved.

25:46.904 --> 25:50.654
Because now you are not in an individual cell,

25:50.737 --> 25:53.737
you are in the expanse, you are in the samashti

25:53.779 --> 25:56.362
and because you have entered into that position,

25:56.445 --> 26:00.237
that’s why you have got these powers of entering to another person’s body,

26:00.320 --> 26:02.862
to see the vibrations of another person,

26:02.946 --> 26:07.362
to raise the Kundalini. Otherwise you could not have done it.

26:08.070 --> 26:12.821
So for you it is very easy because I am also sitting here in person.

26:12.904 --> 26:16.362
So easy to put these emotions just there

26:16.487 --> 26:20.070
so that they get enlightened and your wish is fulfilled,

26:20.153 --> 26:28.821
because emotions are nothing but wishes. These are unfulfilled wishes.

26:29.153 --> 26:36.570
Now how they do it? Otherwise is also this way that you take up these emotions

26:36.821 --> 26:47.612
and put them, so that is, these emotions are actually – the left side,

26:47.737 --> 26:51.696
as I said, is the desire.

26:51.821 --> 26:58.779
So the desire is taken, any desire, and is put in the Prana.

26:58.862 --> 27:02.070
Now how do you put it on the Prana?

27:02.195 --> 27:07.237
That you control your Prana – that’s why they do Prana-yamas, you see?

27:07.570 --> 27:11.904
Like you sit down now, very comfortably,

27:11.986 --> 27:13.987
now you have a desire, you put your attention to that.

27:14.070 --> 27:16.445
Attention is very important – you see?

27:16.570 --> 27:25.529
Now this attention is to be put onto the Prana,

27:25.737 --> 27:29.904
so the emotions are there

27:29.986 --> 27:35.153
and then bring those emotions and put them into your attention,

27:35.195 --> 27:40.529
means they are now, you are aware of them.

27:40.654 --> 27:45.779
Now what you do is to watch your breathing. See now,

27:45.904 --> 27:54.862
try to reduce your breathing, reduce it.

27:57.070 --> 28:06.237
In the sense that you have breathed out, wait for a while, then breath in

28:10.153 --> 28:13.987
for a long time. Then you breathe out.

28:14.320 --> 28:19.028
So in one minute your breezing will be less than normal.

28:19.153 --> 28:22.529
All right? Try that. Breathe in.

28:22.612 --> 28:26.904
now with the emotions, keep the attention on the emotions – you see?

28:26.986 --> 28:30.737
so that the connection is established.

28:58.737 --> 29:06.779
Hmm. Better? You see the Kundalini rises?

29:09.404 --> 29:14.487
Now when you are breathing you find that there is a space in-between,

29:14.570 --> 29:16.821
which you just leave it vacant.

29:17.153 --> 29:19.821
Breathe in!

29:19.904 --> 29:23.028
Now leave it vacant.

29:23.153 --> 29:26.904
Now breathe out.

29:30.153 --> 29:32.904
Now leave it vacant.

29:36.986 --> 29:41.362
Breathe in. Keep it there.

29:43.404 --> 29:46.904
Then leave it.

29:49.153 --> 29:53.570
Keep out-side. Now breathe in.

30:00.404 --> 30:07.404
Now start breathing in such a way that you stop your breathing.

30:27.070 --> 30:33.821
Your attention should be on the heart, or could be on the emotions.

30:41.987 --> 30:43.987
It’s better.

30:48.612 --> 30:51.946
Keep the breathing inside for a while,

30:52.070 --> 30:56.737
then bring it out, then outside for a while.

30:56.862 --> 31:01.654
Then again, then you’ll find that for a while you will not breathe.

31:07.904 --> 31:18.986
Hmm. You see, you settle down. The Laya takes place between your Prana and your Mana.

31:19.153 --> 31:22.987
Both the Shaktis become one.

31:24.445 --> 31:32.904
Now at this stage when you are silent, now you think of your intellect.

31:36.904 --> 31:40.153
It’s lost.

31:40.404 --> 31:43.487
Now just think of it, it’s lost, it’s no more there.

31:43.570 --> 31:48.028
So what is happening, actually that this Laya – the attention

31:48.195 --> 31:53.278
goes into the intellect and enlightens t

32:06.153 --> 32:10.654
Aha, now see, the thought is not there – try to find your intellect within yourself!

32:10.987 --> 32:17.237
Now see! See, where is my intellect? Try to find it!

32:19.404 --> 32:26.237
It’s not there, it’s not working. Again try it!

32:27.153 --> 32:30.779
It is working, but it has become the samashti,

32:30.904 --> 32:34.237
has become the collective now.

32:35.821 --> 32:37.946
Ha! See now!

32:48.112 --> 32:50.821
See now. Did you follow that?

32:54.986 --> 32:57.237
There is no thought.

32:59.320 --> 33:03.779
This exercise will give you this thoughtless awareness,

33:03.821 --> 33:07.487
establishes in you the thoughtless awareness. There is no thought.
