00:18:05.987 --> 00:18:11.529
Now, what we can do is to, Philip,

00:18:11.654 --> 00:18:14.654
what should I tell you the practical side,

00:18:14.737 --> 00:18:16.987
the meditation. All right?

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:23.237
Let’s see what this meditation is, what We have to do on a meditation.

00:18:25.946 --> 00:18:30.570
The first thing we have got is the left side

00:18:30.654 --> 00:18:36.654
is the Mana-Shakti, is the power of your emotions. All right?

00:18:36.737 --> 00:18:42.904
Now, emotions are connected with your right side, also – prana.

00:18:42.986 --> 00:18:45.487
Say for example if you are emotionally disturbed,

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:48.070
just now we got disturbed,

00:18:48.153 --> 00:18:54.153
so our shva, our breathing also increased

00:18:54.237 --> 00:18:59.487
and we felt the whole body was sort of, say reacting

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:05.987
and the, we were feeling the reaction of the Prana, right side also.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.112
That it was trying to express itself.

00:19:08.237 --> 00:19:12.153
Like we started the tears, is the water-element

00:19:12.237 --> 00:19:17.153
and all that came in and the whole emotion was so much pouring out

00:19:17.237 --> 00:19:25.195
and with that our Prana was also involved.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.696
Say for example if you are frightened,

00:19:28.821 --> 00:19:31.904
if you are frightened

00:19:31.986 --> 00:19:35.904
if you are frightened too much then what happens?

00:19:35.986 --> 00:19:39.862
If you are frightened than also you get your breathing

00:19:39.986 --> 00:19:41.028
very fast – isn’t it?

00:19:41.153 --> 00:19:44.153
So it is connected.

00:19:45.487 --> 00:19:48.862
So it is connected. If you are frightened it is connected

00:19:48.946 --> 00:19:52.737
with your Prana, in your breathing

00:19:52.821 --> 00:20:02.237
and your whole system is connected with your emotions, physical system.

00:20:02.986 --> 00:20:07.821
If you cry too much, or if you weep too much, or if you are a sad person

00:20:07.904 --> 00:20:10.946
that shows on your face, your Vishuddhi-Chakra also shows,

00:20:10.987 --> 00:20:13.487
and not only Anahata but also Vishuddhi.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.404
Then also your Agnya goes out.

00:20:16.487 --> 00:20:21.862
So all the Chakras reflect the left side

00:20:21.986 --> 00:20:24.904
in such a way that physical manifestation is also there.

00:20:24.986 --> 00:20:28.153
So it proofs that both are very much connected.

00:20:28.237 --> 00:20:33.946
So to, if you have to, somehow or other,

00:20:33.987 --> 00:20:36.986
dissolve these two sides within us,

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.278
the left and the right side

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:43.529
because if you do not dissolve it,  you are left half way here

00:20:43.654 --> 00:20:45.612
so you have to dissolve these two things.

00:20:45.737 --> 00:20:49.570
And to dissolve these, what should we do?

00:20:49.654 --> 00:20:53.904
What can we do – in meditation?

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:57.487
Can you suggest?

00:21:00.404 --> 00:21:03.487
Say we have got Prana and Mana.

00:21:03.696 --> 00:21:10.445
Now Prana represents the right side and the Mana-Shakti is the left side.

00:21:10.654 --> 00:21:15.737
All right? These two have to be dissolved – in the air, means dissolved.

00:21:15.862 --> 00:21:19.362
Now how do we do it? To dissolve these two things,

00:21:19.487 --> 00:21:22.445
they are connected with each other.

00:21:24.362 --> 00:21:28.737
After realization, not before.

00:21:38.986 --> 00:21:43.570
So before meditation we give ourselves a balance, all right?

00:21:43.654 --> 00:21:46.821
This side is more, this side is less. At the time.

00:21:46.862 --> 00:21:49.487
Supposing you are emotionally – at that time – disturbed,

00:21:49.654 --> 00:21:52.070
then you put your right to the left.

00:21:52.237 --> 00:21:55.362
If you are that time disturbed on the left side

00:21:56.737 --> 00:22:01.946
I mean disturbed in that sense that if a left side is frozen,

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:07.028
then you raise your left side and give yourself a balance before meditation.

00:22:07.237 --> 00:22:10.862
Now let us see, which side is less, first of all.

00:22:10.946 --> 00:22:15.195
Put your hands like that.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.987
Are you all right? Getting cool breeze? Getting it?

00:22:20.070 --> 00:23:04.821
(Shri Mataji speaks to a little girl)

00:23:09.987 --> 00:23:14.278
So once you have given yourself a balance

00:23:14.445 --> 00:23:22.404
then the best thing is to pay attention to your emotions,

00:23:22.529 --> 00:23:26.153
to Manas-Shakti. Watch them.

00:23:26.237 --> 00:23:33.195
You can enlighten your emotions by thinking of your Mother. All right.

00:23:33.278 --> 00:23:35.404
Just enlighten them.

00:23:35.487 --> 00:23:41.696
Just She will solve the problem. Whatever are the problems in the Mana, all right?

00:23:41.862 --> 00:23:48.404
So once you get connected with those emotions

00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:57.028
and you start looking at them in your meditation

00:23:58.278 --> 00:24:03.779
you will see these emotions are rising within you

00:24:04.529 --> 00:24:10.112
and if you try to put these emotions on your Mother,

00:24:10.195 --> 00:24:13.612
as they say at the Lotus-Feet of your Mother,

00:24:14.278 --> 00:24:18.696
they will start also dissolving those emotions

00:24:18.821 --> 00:24:27.237
and they’ll become sort of – ah – expanded. Expanded, you see.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.946
You will extern that in such a way that

00:24:30.987 --> 00:24:34.362
you will feel you are in control, these emotions.

00:24:34.487 --> 00:24:38.278
You are in control of them and by that controlling those emotions

00:24:38.904 --> 00:24:43.904
your emotions – which are expanded, enlightened – are powerful.

00:24:44.404 --> 00:24:50.737
And these emotions, when you feel that way,

00:24:50.946 --> 00:24:56.654
then the cause of those emotions can be solved.

00:24:56.946 --> 00:25:00.570
For example just now you got emotionally stirred up

00:25:00.654 --> 00:25:04.946
because I talked about – say – these children.

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.986
Naturally, anybody would be.

00:25:07.987 --> 00:25:13.153
Now when you are stirred up with that you put that problem

00:25:13.278 --> 00:25:16.112
and those feelings that are rising in you,

00:25:16.278 --> 00:25:21.112
that those waves of feelings that are coming at the Lotus-Feet of your Mother.

00:25:21.654 --> 00:25:27.195
So they get touched, say by that power you can say.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.320
Then these emotions become enlightened

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.570
and when these emotions become enlightened

00:25:33.654 --> 00:25:40.404
they have a power to solve the problem. Do you see the point?

00:25:40.487 --> 00:25:43.529
As if they had reached the shore where they got the light

00:25:43.612 --> 00:25:46.862
and this problem can be solved.

00:25:46.904 --> 00:25:50.654
Because now you are not in an individual cell,

00:25:50.737 --> 00:25:53.737
you are in the expanse, you are in the samashti

00:25:53.779 --> 00:25:56.362
and because you have entered into that position,

00:25:56.445 --> 00:26:00.237
that’s why you have got these powers of entering to another person’s body,

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.862
to see the vibrations of another person,

00:26:02.946 --> 00:26:07.362
to raise the Kundalini. Otherwise you could not have done it.

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:12.821
So for you it is very easy because I am also sitting here in person.

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:16.362
So easy to put these emotions just there

00:26:16.487 --> 00:26:20.070
so that they get enlightened and your wish is fulfilled,

00:26:20.153 --> 00:26:28.821
because emotions are nothing but wishes. These are unfulfilled wishes.

00:26:29.153 --> 00:26:36.570
Now how they do it? Otherwise is also this way that you take up these emotions

00:26:36.821 --> 00:26:47.612
and put them, so that is, these emotions are actually – the left side,

00:26:47.737 --> 00:26:51.696
as I said, is the desire.

00:26:51.821 --> 00:26:58.779
So the desire is taken, any desire, and is put in the Prana.

00:26:58.862 --> 00:27:02.070
Now how do you put it on the Prana?

00:27:02.195 --> 00:27:07.237
That you control your Prana – that’s why they do Prana-yamas, you see?

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:11.904
Like you sit down now, very comfortably,

00:27:11.986 --> 00:27:13.987
now you have a desire, you put your attention to that.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.445
Attention is very important – you see?

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:25.529
Now this attention is to be put onto the Prana,

00:27:25.737 --> 00:27:29.904
so the emotions are there

00:27:29.986 --> 00:27:35.153
and then bring those emotions and put them into your attention,

00:27:35.195 --> 00:27:40.529
means they are now, you are aware of them.

00:27:40.654 --> 00:27:45.779
Now what you do is to watch your breathing. See now,

00:27:45.904 --> 00:27:54.862
try to reduce your breathing, reduce it.

00:27:57.070 --> 00:28:06.237
In the sense that you have breathed out, wait for a while, then breath in

00:28:10.153 --> 00:28:13.987
for a long time. Then you breathe out.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:19.028
So in one minute your breezing will be less than normal.

00:28:19.153 --> 00:28:22.529
All right? Try that. Breathe in.

00:28:22.612 --> 00:28:26.904
now with the emotions, keep the attention on the emotions – you see?

00:28:26.986 --> 00:28:30.737
so that the connection is established.

00:28:58.737 --> 00:29:06.779
Hmm. Better? You see the Kundalini rises?

00:29:09.404 --> 00:29:14.487
Now when you are breathing you find that there is a space in-between,

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:16.821
which you just leave it vacant.

00:29:17.153 --> 00:29:19.821
Breathe in!

00:29:19.904 --> 00:29:23.028
Now leave it vacant.

00:29:23.153 --> 00:29:26.904
Now breathe out.

00:29:30.153 --> 00:29:32.904
Now leave it vacant.

00:29:36.986 --> 00:29:41.362
Breathe in. Keep it there.

00:29:43.404 --> 00:29:46.904
Then leave it.

00:29:49.153 --> 00:29:53.570
Keep out-side. Now breathe in.

00:30:00.404 --> 00:30:07.404
Now start breathing in such a way that you stop your breathing.

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:33.821
Your attention should be on the heart, or could be on the emotions.

00:30:41.987 --> 00:30:43.987
It’s better.

00:30:48.612 --> 00:30:51.946
Keep the breathing inside for a while,

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:56.737
then bring it out, then outside for a while.

00:30:56.862 --> 00:31:01.654
Then again, then you’ll find that for a while you will not breathe.

00:31:07.904 --> 00:31:18.986
Hmm. You see, you settle down. The Laya takes place between your Prana and your Mana.

00:31:19.153 --> 00:31:22.987
Both the Shaktis become one.

00:31:24.445 --> 00:31:32.904
Now at this stage when you are silent, now you think of your intellect.

00:31:36.904 --> 00:31:40.153
It’s lost.

00:31:40.404 --> 00:31:43.487
Now just think of it, it’s lost, it’s no more there.

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:48.028
So what is happening, actually that this Laya – the attention

00:31:48.195 --> 00:31:53.278
goes into the intellect and enlightens t

00:32:06.153 --> 00:32:10.654
Aha, now see, the thought is not there – try to find your intellect within yourself!

00:32:10.987 --> 00:32:17.237
Now see! See, where is my intellect? Try to find it!

00:32:19.404 --> 00:32:26.237
It’s not there, it’s not working. Again try it!

00:32:27.153 --> 00:32:30.779
It is working, but it has become the samashti,

00:32:30.904 --> 00:32:34.237
has become the collective now.

00:32:35.821 --> 00:32:37.946
Ha! See now!

00:32:48.112 --> 00:32:50.821
See now. Did you follow that?

00:32:54.986 --> 00:32:57.237
There is no thought.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:03.779
This exercise will give you this thoughtless awareness,

00:33:03.821 --> 00:33:07.487
establishes in you the thoughtless awareness. There is no thought.
