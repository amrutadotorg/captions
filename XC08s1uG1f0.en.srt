1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,679
So, today's understanding should be that

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:17,040
we all should become collective from inside.

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,468
We should not grudge or grumble about everything

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,880
and enjoy the collectivity.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,120
But the second side of collectivity is this,

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,879
that, do not try to exploit the collectivity

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,360
otherwise you'll be in trouble.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,319
Like, I've seen some people don't know how to use their bathrooms.

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,135
When you are collective you have to be

10
00:00:45,256 --> 00:00:50,459
respecting the collectivity of others.

11
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:57,879
By your presence another person should not, by any chance, suffer,

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:10,560
or should not feel in any way insulted or inconvenienced.

13
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,159
So when you are in the collective it should be such

14
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,759
that another person should enjoy your company,

15
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,280
enjoy your being there.

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:31,120
That is something where there is no problem.

17
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,439
But if you are demanding,

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,543
and if you are asking for things and you think no end of yourself,

19
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:42,872
you can not at all collective, by any chance,

20
00:01:42,993 --> 00:01:51,073
but you'll suffer for that, automatically you will suffer.

21
00:01:52,760 --> 00:02:00,118
If this is realized and understood properly, your Agnya is solved.

22
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,378
Like anger.

23
00:02:11,482 --> 00:02:17,082
There are people always boast, "I'm very angry with him." Boast.

24
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,079
But just make that anger into forgiveness

25
00:02:24,263 --> 00:02:29,000
and you will see the person, instead of you getting into problems,

26
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:31,710
he will get into problems.

27
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:40,574
Anger will upset you, but forgiveness will upset him, automatically.

28
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,160
It's the biggest weapon you have got is to forgive.

29
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,440
And this is shown in Buddha's character throughout.

30
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,438
And this will give you self-respect

31
00:03:06,392 --> 00:03:09,712
that you are not disturbed by anything, you see.

32
00:03:09,916 --> 00:03:13,276
Like a ship has to be seaworthy.

33
00:03:13,397 --> 00:03:15,732
If you put the ship on the sea and if it breaks,

34
00:03:15,853 --> 00:03:18,239
what's the use of making a ship?

35
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,319
What's the use of a Sahaja yogi

36
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,297
who gets disturbed at every moment?

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,920
You have to be seaworthy, and if you are seaworthy

38
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,239
nothing can disturb you. All right.

39
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,480
The elephant is walking and the dogs are barking all right,

40
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:35,323
let them bark. What does it matter?

41
00:03:35,444 --> 00:03:37,712
The elephant looks this side, like that,

42
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:41,439
sometimes takes some water and blesses them with water.

43
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,513
"All right. Quieten down; so that your head will be cooled down."

44
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:54,394
That will give you self-esteem and you will know what you are

45
00:03:54,515 --> 00:03:57,955
much higher than others.

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,200
And this is what is … how to get rid of your ego,

47
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:10,080
which is a very, very big problem according to you people.

48
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,373
"Mother, how to get rid of ego?"

49
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,481
Ego can be said, "You go."

50
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:26,488
When this I-ness goes away, the Self rises.

51
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,200
What is there to feel hurt? What is there to feel bad?

52
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,360
What is there to hurt others?

53
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:36,989
Han [Hindi meaning 'yes'] all right, you are cheated,

54
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,719
very good; at least you have not cheated anyone, be happy about it.

55
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,680
But once you are without ego means you have surrendered yourself,

56
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,483
no one can cheat you.

57
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,655
Can you understand that?

58
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:09,479
No one can cheat you because there is some higher force,

59
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,693
which is looking after you.

60
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,440
This is the way we should understand Buddha.

61
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,958
This is … we should know our Buddha qualities.

62
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:30,800
This is how our ego can be dissolved.

63
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,760
When you say, "Mother, we surrender to You,"

64
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:43,320
That just means that you give that horrible ego a complete holiday,

65
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:51,220
it means that. That is how this ego disappears.

66
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,200
I think all your, your… just now,

67
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,320
your Agnyas are opened out, most of you, somehow.

68
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,444
And then you'll laugh at everything;

69
00:06:06,565 --> 00:06:12,847
you'll make fun of yourself; just enjoy everything.

70
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,764
May God bless you.
