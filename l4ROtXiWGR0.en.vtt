00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:53.095
Today we are celebrating the Birthday of Shri
Ganesha, because it is a very important thing

00:01:53.283 --> 00:01:58.643
for all of us that we should celebrate His
Birthday; and yesterday we did the Havan.

00:01:58.653 --> 00:02:11.943
But yesterday we had many new people so I
could not talk to you very clearly about Shri

00:02:11.943 --> 00:02:14.163
Ganesha’s deeper manifestations.

00:02:14.163 --> 00:02:30.723
You know that He resides within us.

00:02:30.723 --> 00:03:00.933
We have a very great asset within us that
we know about Shri Ganesha, and that we can

00:03:00.933 --> 00:03:06.333
excite His powers.

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:29.773
To manifest Shri Ganesha, we have to do certain
amount of Tapasya, Penance.

00:03:29.773 --> 00:04:05.943
First we have to say, when we sit for meditation,
that, “I am going to be worthy of Your appreciation.

00:04:05.943 --> 00:04:22.682
Make me humble, so that I am appreciated by
You, and my only desire is to please You”.

00:04:22.682 --> 00:04:35.053
Then you sit down in complete preparedness,
meditating over your Mooladhara, putting your

00:04:35.053 --> 00:04:40.763
attention to it with absolute purity.

00:04:40.763 --> 00:04:57.883
Now you have my photograph before you and
you tell the photograph that, “Mother, You are

00:04:57.883 --> 00:05:07.733
Shri Ganesha.

00:05:07.733 --> 00:05:12.643
You give me wisdom and discretion”.

00:05:12.643 --> 00:05:25.173
So, attention at the mooladhara chakra, which
is actually below the sacrum bone.

00:05:25.173 --> 00:05:39.423
You put your right hand towards the photograph,
and left hand on the Mother Earth.

00:05:39.423 --> 00:06:06.933
Now this will tell you that your mind, or
your brain which is full of confusion, which

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:21.653
has no discretion, which is complicated, which
does the same mistakes again and again, which

00:06:21.653 --> 00:06:55.483
does not understand how to cure the ills of
bad feelings, all that can be cured if you

00:06:55.483 --> 00:07:07.703
put your right hand towards me and the left
hand towards the Mother Earth.

00:07:07.703 --> 00:07:10.752
So, in action you do like that.

00:07:10.752 --> 00:07:22.972
Now as He is the ‘essence’ of everything’
that is material, that has bhava , that has

00:07:22.972 --> 00:07:25.203
been created.

00:07:25.203 --> 00:07:33.893
He is the essence of everything that has been
created.

00:07:33.893 --> 00:07:38.263
‘Through Him’ everything has been created.

00:07:38.263 --> 00:07:54.393
When you develop that, you develop your sense
of subtle creativity, and the sense of subtle

00:07:54.393 --> 00:08:01.163
appreciation of creativity.

00:08:01.163 --> 00:08:18.562
Then you develop your discretion of how to
behave with others, in a beautiful manner,

00:08:18.562 --> 00:08:23.243
so that your ego is controlled.

00:08:23.243 --> 00:08:35.453
The behaviour should be such that there should
be no expression of ego in your behaviour.

00:08:35.453 --> 00:08:39.782
Your Mother is a good example.

00:08:39.782 --> 00:08:56.513
I think you know that I know quite a lot of
things, but I never show off, nor ever assert

00:08:56.513 --> 00:09:01.953
that I am so knowledgeable.

00:09:01.953 --> 00:09:17.963
1 live like a very very ordinary person with
you, and I do not in any way assert my personality

00:09:17.963 --> 00:09:23.853
that gives you a shock.

00:09:23.853 --> 00:09:35.374
So, with your intelligence or with your other
powers -like if you are a moneyed man or if

00:09:35.374 --> 00:09:50.063
you are more efficient, or anything, you should
not try to impress on others.

00:09:50.063 --> 00:10:02.203
But you must deal with it beautifully.

00:10:02.203 --> 00:10:09.373
So the beauty comes when you are efficient
“and” you are loving.

00:10:09.373 --> 00:10:16.073
That is the central point, that is the result.

00:10:16.073 --> 00:10:26.753
That you are knowledgeable and you are humble.

00:10:26.753 --> 00:10:35.713
That you know everything about everyone but
you are discreet.

00:10:35.713 --> 00:10:59.982
So in effect it is a complete personality
that can only give that kind of a very soothing

00:10:59.982 --> 00:11:03.352
effect.

00:11:03.352 --> 00:11:16.982
So the soothing effect comes as a result of
beauty.

00:11:16.982 --> 00:11:25.553
So to develop it you have to meditate on your
mooladhara chakra.

00:11:25.553 --> 00:11:35.493
I have seen many people get fanatic about
Sahaja Yoga also.

00:11:35.493 --> 00:11:37.313
They think they are the real Napoleons or
Shivaji!

00:11:37.313 --> 00:11:52.283
In Marathi we call him Shivaji, but Shivaji
was a much better person than Napoleon, better

00:11:52.283 --> 00:11:55.612
to call him Napoleon.

00:11:55.612 --> 00:12:06.443
Then they start guiding you in everything
-“This is not good, that is not good.

00:12:06.443 --> 00:12:08.153
Tam a very great Sahaja Yogi!

00:12:08.153 --> 00:12:21.313
You are like this,” and all that, and very
hot tempered because they are fanatics.

00:12:21.313 --> 00:12:22.612
Fanaticism and temper goes together.

00:12:22.612 --> 00:12:28.643
There is no love in fanaticism.

00:12:28.643 --> 00:12:39.943
If you tell them don’t be a fanatic, they
will start crying.

00:12:39.943 --> 00:12:46.915
So the fanaticism of Sahaja Yoga is most blinding.

00:12:46.915 --> 00:12:52.423
It is something like, in front of the Temple
of God you beg from other people for money.

00:12:52.423 --> 00:13:10.133
Sahaja Yoga is one thing which should not
lead you to ‘any’ fanaticism.

00:13:10.133 --> 00:13:23.523
You have to be prasanna-chitta, which means
you should be a very happy, joyous personality;

00:13:23.523 --> 00:13:31.023
and not a tense, abrupt person.

00:13:31.023 --> 00:13:46.703
But this only achieves it’s maximum result
when everything is done in complete innocence.

00:13:46.703 --> 00:13:51.183
But many people confuse innocence with stupidity.

00:13:51.183 --> 00:13:56.732
They think, to be stupid is innocent.

00:13:56.732 --> 00:14:05.593
And a stupid man gets into an ego trip in
no time.

00:14:05.593 --> 00:14:10.852
Innocence is the wisest thing.

00:14:10.852 --> 00:14:16.922
You ‘cannot’ befool innocence, that’s
the main thing.

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:24.014
No one can befool me, I am very innocent.

00:14:24.014 --> 00:14:35.523
Innocence is
that which does not harm anyone, that does

00:14:35.523 --> 00:14:50.253
not think that it can solve the problems,
but, it leaves everything for God to solve.

00:14:50.253 --> 00:15:08.133
It is just existence itself-in the blessings
of your Mother, as Ganesha was, just living

00:15:08.133 --> 00:15:17.143
on the complete blessings of His Mother.

00:15:17.143 --> 00:15:23.003
It gives you concentration.

00:15:23.003 --> 00:15:33.883
Have you seen a child being nursed by mother,
how concentrated the child is.

00:15:33.883 --> 00:15:38.852
Sucking everything!

00:15:38.852 --> 00:15:58.253
It doesn’t bother who is who, where he is
sitting, what is it, what is catching.

00:15:58.253 --> 00:16:11.133
It doesn’t bother as to who is next to you,
what is your relationship with others.

00:16:11.133 --> 00:16:21.603
Or it doesn’t bother, at all, as to the
future, as

00:16:21.603 --> 00:16:28.792
to what he is to do next.

00:16:28.792 --> 00:16:34.412
So innocence keeps you in the present.

00:16:34.412 --> 00:16:36.243
Innocent man is permanently relaxed.

00:16:36.243 --> 00:16:40.403
Supposing I have to go today.

00:16:40.403 --> 00:16:51.912
Alright, so I’ll go at the time when I have
to go; what’s the use of getting agitated

00:16:51.912 --> 00:16:56.353
about it?

00:16:56.353 --> 00:16:59.183
People get even 10 days ahead agitated if
they have to go after ten days.

00:16:59.183 --> 00:17:10.813
And when it really comes to going, they have
forgotten everything.

00:17:10.813 --> 00:17:18.203
Because they are not in the present.

00:17:18.203 --> 00:17:22.703
So to develop your innocence also is a very
good idea ‘to be in the present’.

00:17:22.703 --> 00:17:28.303
At the most what’s going to happen?

00:17:28.303 --> 00:17:37.742
I mean whatever has to happen will happen
in any case.

00:17:37.742 --> 00:17:38.982
So why worry?

00:17:38.982 --> 00:17:47.762
I am one person who is least worried, and
nothing has gone wrong with me so far.

00:17:47.762 --> 00:18:06.523
On the contrary I play tricks that everything
goes wrong with people like that!

00:18:06.523 --> 00:18:18.382
And I want them to learn that this is not
so important.

00:18:18.382 --> 00:18:26.333
To keep yourself in the present is your job
and leave everything to God Because you don’t

00:18:26.333 --> 00:18:41.142
know that when you are in the present you
are in contact with the Divine power, but

00:18:41.142 --> 00:18:54.303
when you get out of the present you are not
there -you are under your ego or superego.

00:18:54.303 --> 00:19:04.023
So for all of you I may try just to show that
I am also playing with you to prepare you.

00:19:04.023 --> 00:19:10.692
I am least bothered about anything whatsoever.

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:25.092
What is such a disaster you have seen in your
life, just tell me.

00:19:25.092 --> 00:19:31.872
I have seen the last dissolution of the whole
universe.

00:19:31.872 --> 00:19:38.512
What can I fear anymore?

00:19:38.512 --> 00:19:50.213
So when you get upset, think of something
very serious that has happened to you before,

00:19:50.213 --> 00:20:06.632
and then you will not be so much worried about
the non sensical little things here and there.

00:20:06.632 --> 00:20:13.232
So miraculous things will happen, through
your innocence.

00:20:13.232 --> 00:20:21.752
The more innocent you are the more blissful
you will be.

00:20:21.752 --> 00:20:29.873
Now, many people should try this thing: sitting
in a group together, meditating, saying the

00:20:29.873 --> 00:20:38.992
mantra of Shri Ganesha, to try to build up.

00:20:38.992 --> 00:20:54.942
Those who think too much, they should also
try to say “Not this, not this, not this

00:20:54.942 --> 00:20:55.942
… “.

00:20:55.942 --> 00:21:07.653
Even the superego when it gives you thoughts,
you should say “not this, not this, not

00:21:07.653 --> 00:21:08.653
this … “.

00:21:08.653 --> 00:21:21.582
So you will develop that state where you stand
yourself: and nothing else.

00:21:21.582 --> 00:21:37.072
So the innocence plays, but it is not involved.

00:21:37.072 --> 00:21:46.612
It sees the play.

00:21:46.612 --> 00:21:49.462
Just sees.

00:21:49.462 --> 00:21:56.332
It enjoys the play.

00:21:56.332 --> 00:21:58.553
Just enjoys.

00:21:58.553 --> 00:22:14.612
So today when we are thinking of Shri Ganesha,
let us desire that, “Within us His great

00:22:14.612 --> 00:22:19.112
power of innocence be enlightened”.

00:22:19.112 --> 00:22:34.112
And He is, on the other side, the source of
love.

00:22:34.112 --> 00:22:39.062
The source of emotional security.

00:22:39.062 --> 00:22:50.757
He’s like a child, a very charming, beautiful
child, and people feel extremely enchanted.

00:22:50.782 --> 00:23:12.046
Charmed, seeing that innocence?  You see it's a fraternal love, a fraternal enchantment for him.

00:23:12.071 --> 00:23:14.335
A motherly enchantment.

00:23:20.502 --> 00:23:23.663
Because ” charming” also is a very funny
word.

00:23:23.663 --> 00:23:41.852
Because in the west people don’t understand
even innocence towards children.

00:23:41.852 --> 00:23:52.793
So you have to be childlike, not childish,
confusion must not be there.

00:23:52.793 --> 00:23:54.722
But some people confuse it.

00:23:54.722 --> 00:24:07.572
They think it should be like a big baby, you
see; and that you have to be treated like

00:24:07.572 --> 00:24:12.423
a big baby all the time, from bottle feeding
to nappy changing, in Marathi it is called

00:24:12.423 --> 00:24:16.092
“Motha Bal”.

00:24:16.092 --> 00:24:27.112
And there’s no end to it.

00:24:27.112 --> 00:24:43.733
So this kind of thing, if it is done to someone,
that really will become a stupid fellow in

00:24:43.733 --> 00:24:46.872
no time.

00:24:46.872 --> 00:24:54.702
But Ganesha’s enchantment has dignity.

00:24:54.702 --> 00:25:05.846
He may look like a child, but He is an old
man.

00:25:05.846 --> 00:25:09.012
He is the eldest of all.

00:25:09.012 --> 00:25:19.832
And despite all these years, he has kept His
innocence intact.

00:25:19.832 --> 00:25:33.012
So sometimes people confuse it with over doting or sort of caring too much, and the innocent person

00:25:33.012 --> 00:25:44.462
doesn’t like it much.

00:25:44.462 --> 00:25:53.312
Even if somebody does it, He wouldn't mind,
because it pleases the other person.

00:25:53.312 --> 00:26:04.582
But it does not go to his head or anything.

00:26:04.582 --> 00:26:10.833
On the contrary, when you are doting on such
a person, you start learning.

00:26:10.833 --> 00:26:21.572
There was somebody like that he was an
expert on massaging the feet.

00:26:21.572 --> 00:26:33.072
So she said “Mother, just you give me one
hour one day and I will come and massage your

00:26:33.072 --> 00:26:39.702
Feet, because I have known that art”.

00:26:39.702 --> 00:26:47.283
I said alright, come such and such day.

00:26:47.283 --> 00:26:56.293
And when she started massaging my feet, you
see, she said, “What is happening!

00:26:56.293 --> 00:27:00.303
It is me who is relaxing”.

00:27:00.303 --> 00:27:10.012
So, that is the beauty of innocence, that
when you try to pamper the innocence, when

00:27:10.012 --> 00:27:27.033
you try to dote on the innocence, it emits
the beauty.

00:27:27.033 --> 00:27:28.033
It relaxes.

00:27:28.033 --> 00:27:33.742
If there is a little child, and you want to
kiss the child and you want to embrace the

00:27:33.742 --> 00:27:45.122
child and you want to love the child -it is
‘you’ who is wanting, not the child.

00:27:45.122 --> 00:27:56.043
If you do not want it, you are abnormal.

00:27:56.043 --> 00:28:03.762
But if you want to dote on some one, then
that should ‘relax’ that person, the one

00:28:03.762 --> 00:28:07.922
who does that.

00:28:07.922 --> 00:28:14.043
But if it is the other way round, that the
other person gets tensed up and the person

00:28:14.043 --> 00:28:20.372
whom you dote, gets becomes ego-oriented, then it
is all wrong, absolutely it is upside down.

00:28:20.372 --> 00:28:32.922
You get tensed up because you think nothing
should displease the person, you think the

00:28:32.922 --> 00:28:59.972
person needs it.

00:28:59.972 --> 00:29:10.913
You try to dote on the child thinking that
the child needs it.

00:29:10.913 --> 00:29:16.403
It is ‘you’ who need it.

00:29:16.403 --> 00:29:21.582
If you remember that, that ‘you’ need
it then why should you worry that you should

00:29:21.582 --> 00:29:34.913
not do this particular thing the person will
be displeased.

00:29:34.913 --> 00:29:42.832
So just by pleasing yourself you are really
pleasing the other person, one has to see

00:29:42.832 --> 00:29:44.942
it that way.

00:29:44.942 --> 00:29:51.092
So this is wisdom: To see things in right
perspective.

00:29:51.092 --> 00:29:59.262
And that is what should come into everyone
spontaneously.

00:29:59.262 --> 00:30:09.892
When that comes in, you become a complete
personality.

00:30:09.892 --> 00:30:19.632
Ganesha is sufficient to make
you complete, because He is complete.

00:30:19.632 --> 00:30:28.303
And as it is, for you people to do it, it
is easier, because you are already at a point

00:30:28.303 --> 00:30:40.072
where Ganesha is pleased.

00:30:40.072 --> 00:30:45.842
Or we can say that you are pleased with yourself.

00:30:45.842 --> 00:30:51.422
So one should not feel that, or should not
feel bad.

00:30:51.422 --> 00:30:59.862
If someone feels hurt or something, that means
there is something lacking in that person.

00:30:59.862 --> 00:31:16.112
Such a personality is the personality where
we can say that Shri Ganesha is residing with

00:31:16.112 --> 00:31:19.612
all His powers.

00:31:19.612 --> 00:31:29.812
But some people have the right Ganesha and
some people have the left Ganesha powers.

00:31:29.812 --> 00:31:39.192
Both the types of powers must be developed.

00:31:39.192 --> 00:31:46.222
If a man has been licentious and very fond
of the other sex and all that, he gets such

00:31:46.222 --> 00:32:05.913
a rebound that he be comes an ‘absolutely’
left-side character.

00:32:05.913 --> 00:32:10.993
Supposing before realisation he is running
after women, or the girl is running after the

00:32:10.993 --> 00:32:18.122
men, all that, gets such a rebound that, he
just doesn’t want to do that thing, as a

00:32:18.122 --> 00:32:39.413
filth, he thinks its filth, that is one of
the feelings that come in the mind of a person,

00:32:39.413 --> 00:32:58.462
when he doesn’t hanker after this kind of
nonsense.

00:32:58.462 --> 00:33:18.002
Like we have horrible names like heterosexuals
and homosexuals and all sexual sorts.

00:33:18.002 --> 00:33:44.222
When you keep a healthy company of your’
type, of your sex, healthy company healthy and pure.

00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:53.283
It is very natural.

00:33:53.283 --> 00:34:10.732
And the another extreme nature should
not be followed.

00:34:10.732 --> 00:34:17.572
Like, I have also seen among some muslims, this is a habit,
that they are more attached to their daughters

00:34:17.572 --> 00:34:19.132
than to their wives.

00:34:19.132 --> 00:34:20.523
Funny thing.

00:34:20.523 --> 00:34:24.342
It is absurd.

00:34:24.342 --> 00:34:30.333
They pay more importance to the daughters
than to the wife -it is something very absurd,

00:34:30.333 --> 00:34:32.113
it is not good.

00:34:32.113 --> 00:34:35.502
It’s again perversion.

00:34:35.502 --> 00:34:47.643
Or the women, they love their son more than
their husband.

00:34:47.643 --> 00:34:52.433
It is absurd.

00:34:52.433 --> 00:34:57.223
And once it starts working like that, it can
go to any absurd limit, which is not in the

00:34:57.223 --> 00:35:04.293
‘maryadas’ in the boundaries of Sahaja
Yoga.

00:35:04.293 --> 00:35:19.733
There has to be very healthy relationship.

00:35:19.733 --> 00:35:30.743
Friendship, but not attachment which looks
funny and absurd.

00:35:30.743 --> 00:35:32.652
So nothing absurd should be done.

00:35:32.652 --> 00:35:35.922
No thing overly should be done.

00:35:35.922 --> 00:35:48.043
Because there will be remorse and unnecessary
heart burning for nothing at all, it is useless.

00:35:48.043 --> 00:35:56.973
Now, in Sahaja Yoga another very important
point I have to tell you today, which is not

00:35:56.973 --> 00:36:01.643
so much besides Shri Ganesha’s point, which we always make mistakes.

00:36:01.643 --> 00:36:17.753
Then in India there have been lots of
Mistakes like that: Now I give you one example

00:36:17.753 --> 00:36:18.753
of Mr.

00:36:18.753 --> 00:36:29.882
X who is a great Sahaja Yogi, in the sense
that he is a great organiser he has done this,

00:36:29.882 --> 00:36:35.733
he has done that, and we start adoring him.

00:36:35.733 --> 00:36:38.983
Or we may be jealous.

00:36:38.983 --> 00:36:43.912
One of the two things happen, either we adore
or we are jealous.

00:36:43.912 --> 00:36:48.983
Now, if you adore that person, then you must
follow his footsteps.

00:36:48.983 --> 00:37:01.372
And if you are jealous, then it is more reason
that you follow his footsteps so you become

00:37:01.372 --> 00:37:02.833
like him.

00:37:02.833 --> 00:37:08.912
I am talking of wisdom.

00:37:08.912 --> 00:37:20.652
Now, but instead of that when you adore -even
whether you are a boy or a girl, you will

00:37:20.652 --> 00:37:35.173
jump on him, you will hug him and kiss him,
you do all kinds of non sensical things.

00:37:35.173 --> 00:37:38.373
Which is ‘not needed’ to express that
way.

00:37:38.373 --> 00:37:43.192
Like it happened with me that I was in London
for the first time.

00:37:43.192 --> 00:37:54.412
I’d never known all this, and somebody who
was quite hefty just came and hugged me, and

00:37:54.412 --> 00:38:10.773
I didn’t know what was the word in this
language.

00:38:10.773 --> 00:38:23.483
So I told him in marathi “Put me down”.

00:38:23.483 --> 00:38:30.183
So it is quite funny.

00:38:30.183 --> 00:38:43.583
I am not used to kissing at all, ‘at all’.

00:38:43.583 --> 00:38:52.363
Anybody kisses me, I get a fright you know.

00:38:52.363 --> 00:39:03.352
I can kiss a lady or a little boy that is
all right, that is done, but not every man,

00:39:03.352 --> 00:39:11.023
I cannot kiss -it’s very funny, isn’t
it?

00:39:11.023 --> 00:39:17.452
So this kind of adoration is not very wise.

00:39:17.452 --> 00:39:23.843
Adoration is to be felt in your heart.

00:39:23.843 --> 00:39:29.253
Like yesterday one of the gentlemen put his
hand so strong on me, that for two minutes

00:39:29.253 --> 00:39:35.853
I was just trying to put it right.

00:39:35.853 --> 00:39:44.073
And this shaking hands is a very horrible
thing.

00:39:44.073 --> 00:39:47.632
Sometimes they cannot feel alright unless
and until they have taken about a kilo of

00:39:47.632 --> 00:39:48.632
Meat out.

00:39:48.632 --> 00:40:02.573
…And this is how sometimes, there are no
maryadas’ left, even among ourselves.

00:40:02.573 --> 00:40:13.133
So there should be maryadas.

00:40:13.133 --> 00:40:27.192
Now feeling jealousy is another thing.

00:40:27.192 --> 00:40:39.253
I have seen that when people feel jealous,
they start coming and complaining against

00:40:39.253 --> 00:40:50.692
this person or that person -I know it is.

00:40:50.692 --> 00:40:52.973
Jealousy is the worst curse ever we can have,
I think, because then you can’t see anything

00:40:52.973 --> 00:40:53.973
that is good.

00:40:53.973 --> 00:41:01.283
Because you see a person is normal, you feel
jealous of such a person.

00:41:01.283 --> 00:41:15.333
Then you feel, you are jealous so you have
every right to do what you like.

00:41:15.333 --> 00:41:21.442
You just say,” I am jealous of you, because
you are so good.

00:41:21.442 --> 00:41:32.662
So, now I can be very bad.

00:41:32.662 --> 00:41:36.692
I mean at first it started with people telling
that this is jealousy which is a bad thing;

00:41:36.692 --> 00:41:37.692
it was all right.

00:41:37.692 --> 00:41:45.063
But now the bad thing is taken as blackmail,
you see, you use it.

00:41:45.063 --> 00:41:49.083
for blackmailing others, that, “Oh, alright!

00:41:49.083 --> 00:41:51.842
I am a bad man, so I am a bad man.

00:41:51.842 --> 00:42:00.122
You are a good man, alright, So what?”

00:42:00.122 --> 00:42:03.723
Just like that.

00:42:03.723 --> 00:42:10.083
To use it as a power.

00:42:10.083 --> 00:42:12.622
Like yesterday one madman came, a lunatic.

00:42:12.622 --> 00:42:21.003
Now when this lunatic came, he wanted to sit
in the front.

00:42:21.003 --> 00:42:33.043
And he just started taking advantage of his
lunacy!

00:42:33.043 --> 00:42:34.202
That if he is a lunatic, he can behave the
way he likes.

00:42:34.202 --> 00:42:39.413
Because you are a drunkard you can behave
the way you like.

00:42:39.413 --> 00:42:41.493
Now, what is the wisdom?

00:42:41.493 --> 00:42:45.523
Where is it lost?

00:42:45.523 --> 00:42:48.543
It is ridiculous.

00:42:48.543 --> 00:42:54.593
So, one has to be wise.

00:42:54.593 --> 00:43:01.243
When you are dealing with it, the wisdom is
your glory.

00:43:01.243 --> 00:43:12.393
By wisdom you will be fair to yourself and
fair to others.

00:43:12.393 --> 00:43:18.813
Wisdom is like an ocean, one can not describe
it

00:43:18.813 --> 00:43:23.713
in one lecture.

00:43:23.713 --> 00:43:33.513
Just try to enjoy your wisdom.

00:43:33.513 --> 00:43:37.323
And the greatest wisdom of Shri Ganesha was
that he was surrendered to his Mother, that

00:43:37.323 --> 00:43:38.763
is all; he is not bothered.

00:43:38.763 --> 00:43:51.902
And when you
are surrendered then you just understand that

00:43:51.902 --> 00:44:04.813
you give up your ego and superego to
your Mother to bother about it, and you live

00:44:04.813 --> 00:44:11.773
with your innocence.

00:44:11.773 --> 00:44:21.273
And to understand also in a very gross way,
we can say, to have Ganesha tattva (Principle)

00:44:21.273 --> 00:44:29.803
developed in you, you must eat things which
are emitting Ganesha Principle.

00:44:29.803 --> 00:44:32.202
Like the Chana, like, I have found out, the
Hazelnut.

00:44:32.202 --> 00:44:43.233
Then you can see that you should use a lot
of these lemons, is a good idea.

00:44:43.233 --> 00:44:55.303
All these give you a good Ganesha Tattva.

00:44:55.303 --> 00:45:12.723
So all these things should be used, and there
are many other things one can see that, which

00:45:12.723 --> 00:45:15.323
help you to develop your Ganesha Tattva.

00:45:15.323 --> 00:45:24.513
But the highest of all is to control your
eyes.

00:45:24.513 --> 00:45:32.753
Not to see anything that is tempting.

00:45:32.753 --> 00:45:38.452
So put your eyes on the ground.

00:45:38.452 --> 00:45:52.362
Just watch your eyes when another sex arrives,
how do you look at that person, with greed,

00:45:52.362 --> 00:45:58.192
with lust.

00:45:58.192 --> 00:46:12.622
And if you understand that then you will start
clearing your eyes very well.

00:46:12.622 --> 00:46:20.142
Another thing is physically you should try
to do one or two exercises to be able to put

00:46:20.142 --> 00:46:31.463
yourself flat on the Mother Earth, because
that helps.

00:46:31.463 --> 00:46:40.412
So before doing the meditation to Shri Ganesha,
you must first do that exercise, to loosen

00:46:40.412 --> 00:46:55.763
the muscles so that you should touch the Mother
Earth in a more flat way.

00:46:55.763 --> 00:47:01.902
It will help.

00:47:01.902 --> 00:47:12.803
So for today I think I have said sufficiently.
