WEBVTT

01:39.375 --> 01:53.095
Today we are celebrating the Birthday of Shri
Ganesha, because it is a very important thing

01:53.283 --> 01:58.643
for all of us that we should celebrate His
Birthday; and yesterday we did the Havan.

01:58.653 --> 02:11.943
But yesterday we had many new people so I
could not talk to you very clearly about Shri

02:11.943 --> 02:14.163
Ganesha’s deeper manifestations.

02:14.163 --> 02:30.723
You know that He resides within us.

02:30.723 --> 03:00.933
We have a very great asset within us that
we know about Shri Ganesha, and that we can

03:00.933 --> 03:06.333
excite His powers.

03:06.333 --> 03:29.773
To manifest Shri Ganesha, we have to do certain
amount of Tapasya, Penance.

03:29.773 --> 04:05.943
First we have to say, when we sit for meditation,
that, “I am going to be worthy of Your appreciation.

04:05.943 --> 04:22.682
Make me humble, so that I am appreciated by
You, and my only desire is to please You”.

04:22.682 --> 04:35.053
Then you sit down in complete preparedness,
meditating over your Mooladhara, putting your

04:35.053 --> 04:40.763
attention to it with absolute purity.

04:40.763 --> 04:57.883
Now you have my photograph before you and
you tell the photograph that, “Mother, You are

04:57.883 --> 05:07.733
Shri Ganesha.

05:07.733 --> 05:12.643
You give me wisdom and discretion”.

05:12.643 --> 05:25.173
So, attention at the mooladhara chakra, which
is actually below the sacrum bone.

05:25.173 --> 05:39.423
You put your right hand towards the photograph,
and left hand on the Mother Earth.

05:39.423 --> 06:06.933
Now this will tell you that your mind, or
your brain which is full of confusion, which

06:06.933 --> 06:21.653
has no discretion, which is complicated, which
does the same mistakes again and again, which

06:21.653 --> 06:55.483
does not understand how to cure the ills of
bad feelings, all that can be cured if you

06:55.483 --> 07:07.703
put your right hand towards me and the left
hand towards the Mother Earth.

07:07.703 --> 07:10.752
So, in action you do like that.

07:10.752 --> 07:22.972
Now as He is the ‘essence’ of everything’
that is material, that has bhava , that has

07:22.972 --> 07:25.203
been created.

07:25.203 --> 07:33.893
He is the essence of everything that has been
created.

07:33.893 --> 07:38.263
‘Through Him’ everything has been created.

07:38.263 --> 07:54.393
When you develop that, you develop your sense
of subtle creativity, and the sense of subtle

07:54.393 --> 08:01.163
appreciation of creativity.

08:01.163 --> 08:18.562
Then you develop your discretion of how to
behave with others, in a beautiful manner,

08:18.562 --> 08:23.243
so that your ego is controlled.

08:23.243 --> 08:35.453
The behaviour should be such that there should
be no expression of ego in your behaviour.

08:35.453 --> 08:39.782
Your Mother is a good example.

08:39.782 --> 08:56.513
I think you know that I know quite a lot of
things, but I never show off, nor ever assert

08:56.513 --> 09:01.953
that I am so knowledgeable.

09:01.953 --> 09:17.963
1 live like a very very ordinary person with
you, and I do not in any way assert my personality

09:17.963 --> 09:23.853
that gives you a shock.

09:23.853 --> 09:35.374
So, with your intelligence or with your other
powers -like if you are a moneyed man or if

09:35.374 --> 09:50.063
you are more efficient, or anything, you should
not try to impress on others.

09:50.063 --> 10:02.203
But you must deal with it beautifully.

10:02.203 --> 10:09.373
So the beauty comes when you are efficient
“and” you are loving.

10:09.373 --> 10:16.073
That is the central point, that is the result.

10:16.073 --> 10:26.753
That you are knowledgeable and you are humble.

10:26.753 --> 10:35.713
That you know everything about everyone but
you are discreet.

10:35.713 --> 10:59.982
So in effect it is a complete personality
that can only give that kind of a very soothing

10:59.982 --> 11:03.352
effect.

11:03.352 --> 11:16.982
So the soothing effect comes as a result of
beauty.

11:16.982 --> 11:25.553
So to develop it you have to meditate on your
mooladhara chakra.

11:25.553 --> 11:35.493
I have seen many people get fanatic about
Sahaja Yoga also.

11:35.493 --> 11:37.313
They think they are the real Napoleons or
Shivaji!

11:37.313 --> 11:52.283
In Marathi we call him Shivaji, but Shivaji
was a much better person than Napoleon, better

11:52.283 --> 11:55.612
to call him Napoleon.

11:55.612 --> 12:06.443
Then they start guiding you in everything
-“This is not good, that is not good.

12:06.443 --> 12:08.153
Tam a very great Sahaja Yogi!

12:08.153 --> 12:21.313
You are like this,” and all that, and very
hot tempered because they are fanatics.

12:21.313 --> 12:22.612
Fanaticism and temper goes together.

12:22.612 --> 12:28.643
There is no love in fanaticism.

12:28.643 --> 12:39.943
If you tell them don’t be a fanatic, they
will start crying.

12:39.943 --> 12:46.915
So the fanaticism of Sahaja Yoga is most blinding.

12:46.915 --> 12:52.423
It is something like, in front of the Temple
of God you beg from other people for money.

12:52.423 --> 13:10.133
Sahaja Yoga is one thing which should not
lead you to ‘any’ fanaticism.

13:10.133 --> 13:23.523
You have to be prasanna-chitta, which means
you should be a very happy, joyous personality;

13:23.523 --> 13:31.023
and not a tense, abrupt person.

13:31.023 --> 13:46.703
But this only achieves it’s maximum result
when everything is done in complete innocence.

13:46.703 --> 13:51.183
But many people confuse innocence with stupidity.

13:51.183 --> 13:56.732
They think, to be stupid is innocent.

13:56.732 --> 14:05.593
And a stupid man gets into an ego trip in
no time.

14:05.593 --> 14:10.852
Innocence is the wisest thing.

14:10.852 --> 14:16.922
You ‘cannot’ befool innocence, that’s
the main thing.

14:16.922 --> 14:24.014
No one can befool me, I am very innocent.

14:24.014 --> 14:35.523
Innocence is
that which does not harm anyone, that does

14:35.523 --> 14:50.253
not think that it can solve the problems,
but, it leaves everything for God to solve.

14:50.253 --> 15:08.133
It is just existence itself-in the blessings
of your Mother, as Ganesha was, just living

15:08.133 --> 15:17.143
on the complete blessings of His Mother.

15:17.143 --> 15:23.003
It gives you concentration.

15:23.003 --> 15:33.883
Have you seen a child being nursed by mother,
how concentrated the child is.

15:33.883 --> 15:38.852
Sucking everything!

15:38.852 --> 15:58.253
It doesn’t bother who is who, where he is
sitting, what is it, what is catching.

15:58.253 --> 16:11.133
It doesn’t bother as to who is next to you,
what is your relationship with others.

16:11.133 --> 16:21.603
Or it doesn’t bother, at all, as to the
future, as

16:21.603 --> 16:28.792
to what he is to do next.

16:28.792 --> 16:34.412
So innocence keeps you in the present.

16:34.412 --> 16:36.243
Innocent man is permanently relaxed.

16:36.243 --> 16:40.403
Supposing I have to go today.

16:40.403 --> 16:51.912
Alright, so I’ll go at the time when I have
to go; what’s the use of getting agitated

16:51.912 --> 16:56.353
about it?

16:56.353 --> 16:59.183
People get even 10 days ahead agitated if
they have to go after ten days.

16:59.183 --> 17:10.813
And when it really comes to going, they have
forgotten everything.

17:10.813 --> 17:18.203
Because they are not in the present.

17:18.203 --> 17:22.703
So to develop your innocence also is a very
good idea ‘to be in the present’.

17:22.703 --> 17:28.303
At the most what’s going to happen?

17:28.303 --> 17:37.742
I mean whatever has to happen will happen
in any case.

17:37.742 --> 17:38.982
So why worry?

17:38.982 --> 17:47.762
I am one person who is least worried, and
nothing has gone wrong with me so far.

17:47.762 --> 18:06.523
On the contrary I play tricks that everything
goes wrong with people like that!

18:06.523 --> 18:18.382
And I want them to learn that this is not
so important.

18:18.382 --> 18:26.333
To keep yourself in the present is your job
and leave everything to God Because you don’t

18:26.333 --> 18:41.142
know that when you are in the present you
are in contact with the Divine power, but

18:41.142 --> 18:54.303
when you get out of the present you are not
there -you are under your ego or superego.

18:54.303 --> 19:04.023
So for all of you I may try just to show that
I am also playing with you to prepare you.

19:04.023 --> 19:10.692
I am least bothered about anything whatsoever.

19:10.692 --> 19:25.092
What is such a disaster you have seen in your
life, just tell me.

19:25.092 --> 19:31.872
I have seen the last dissolution of the whole
universe.

19:31.872 --> 19:38.512
What can I fear anymore?

19:38.512 --> 19:50.213
So when you get upset, think of something
very serious that has happened to you before,

19:50.213 --> 20:06.632
and then you will not be so much worried about
the non sensical little things here and there.

20:06.632 --> 20:13.232
So miraculous things will happen, through
your innocence.

20:13.232 --> 20:21.752
The more innocent you are the more blissful
you will be.

20:21.752 --> 20:29.873
Now, many people should try this thing: sitting
in a group together, meditating, saying the

20:29.873 --> 20:38.992
mantra of Shri Ganesha, to try to build up.

20:38.992 --> 20:54.942
Those who think too much, they should also
try to say “Not this, not this, not this

20:54.942 --> 20:55.942
… “.

20:55.942 --> 21:07.653
Even the superego when it gives you thoughts,
you should say “not this, not this, not

21:07.653 --> 21:08.653
this … “.

21:08.653 --> 21:21.582
So you will develop that state where you stand
yourself: and nothing else.

21:21.582 --> 21:37.072
So the innocence plays, but it is not involved.

21:37.072 --> 21:46.612
It sees the play.

21:46.612 --> 21:49.462
Just sees.

21:49.462 --> 21:56.332
It enjoys the play.

21:56.332 --> 21:58.553
Just enjoys.

21:58.553 --> 22:14.612
So today when we are thinking of Shri Ganesha,
let us desire that, “Within us His great

22:14.612 --> 22:19.112
power of innocence be enlightened”.

22:19.112 --> 22:34.112
And He is, on the other side, the source of
love.

22:34.112 --> 22:39.062
The source of emotional security.

22:39.062 --> 22:50.757
He’s like a child, a very charming, beautiful
child, and people feel extremely enchanted.

22:50.782 --> 23:12.046
Charmed, seeing that innocence?  You see it's a fraternal love, a fraternal enchantment for him.

23:12.071 --> 23:14.335
A motherly enchantment.

23:20.502 --> 23:23.663
Because ” charming” also is a very funny
word.

23:23.663 --> 23:41.852
Because in the west people don’t understand
even innocence towards children.

23:41.852 --> 23:52.793
So you have to be childlike, not childish,
confusion must not be there.

23:52.793 --> 23:54.722
But some people confuse it.

23:54.722 --> 24:07.572
They think it should be like a big baby, you
see; and that you have to be treated like

24:07.572 --> 24:12.423
a big baby all the time, from bottle feeding
to nappy changing, in Marathi it is called

24:12.423 --> 24:16.092
“Motha Bal”.

24:16.092 --> 24:27.112
And there’s no end to it.

24:27.112 --> 24:43.733
So this kind of thing, if it is done to someone,
that really will become a stupid fellow in

24:43.733 --> 24:46.872
no time.

24:46.872 --> 24:54.702
But Ganesha’s enchantment has dignity.

24:54.702 --> 25:05.846
He may look like a child, but He is an old
man.

25:05.846 --> 25:09.012
He is the eldest of all.

25:09.012 --> 25:19.832
And despite all these years, he has kept His
innocence intact.

25:19.832 --> 25:33.012
So sometimes people confuse it with over doting or sort of caring too much, and the innocent person

25:33.012 --> 25:44.462
doesn’t like it much.

25:44.462 --> 25:53.312
Even if somebody does it, He wouldn't mind,
because it pleases the other person.

25:53.312 --> 26:04.582
But it does not go to his head or anything.

26:04.582 --> 26:10.833
On the contrary, when you are doting on such
a person, you start learning.

26:10.833 --> 26:21.572
There was somebody like that he was an
expert on massaging the feet.

26:21.572 --> 26:33.072
So she said “Mother, just you give me one
hour one day and I will come and massage your

26:33.072 --> 26:39.702
Feet, because I have known that art”.

26:39.702 --> 26:47.283
I said alright, come such and such day.

26:47.283 --> 26:56.293
And when she started massaging my feet, you
see, she said, “What is happening!

26:56.293 --> 27:00.303
It is me who is relaxing”.

27:00.303 --> 27:10.012
So, that is the beauty of innocence, that
when you try to pamper the innocence, when

27:10.012 --> 27:27.033
you try to dote on the innocence, it emits
the beauty.

27:27.033 --> 27:28.033
It relaxes.

27:28.033 --> 27:33.742
If there is a little child, and you want to
kiss the child and you want to embrace the

27:33.742 --> 27:45.122
child and you want to love the child -it is
‘you’ who is wanting, not the child.

27:45.122 --> 27:56.043
If you do not want it, you are abnormal.

27:56.043 --> 28:03.762
But if you want to dote on some one, then
that should ‘relax’ that person, the one

28:03.762 --> 28:07.922
who does that.

28:07.922 --> 28:14.043
But if it is the other way round, that the
other person gets tensed up and the person

28:14.043 --> 28:20.372
whom you dote, gets becomes ego-oriented, then it
is all wrong, absolutely it is upside down.

28:20.372 --> 28:32.922
You get tensed up because you think nothing
should displease the person, you think the

28:32.922 --> 28:59.972
person needs it.

28:59.972 --> 29:10.913
You try to dote on the child thinking that
the child needs it.

29:10.913 --> 29:16.403
It is ‘you’ who need it.

29:16.403 --> 29:21.582
If you remember that, that ‘you’ need
it then why should you worry that you should

29:21.582 --> 29:34.913
not do this particular thing the person will
be displeased.

29:34.913 --> 29:42.832
So just by pleasing yourself you are really
pleasing the other person, one has to see

29:42.832 --> 29:44.942
it that way.

29:44.942 --> 29:51.092
So this is wisdom: To see things in right
perspective.

29:51.092 --> 29:59.262
And that is what should come into everyone
spontaneously.

29:59.262 --> 30:09.892
When that comes in, you become a complete
personality.

30:09.892 --> 30:19.632
Ganesha is sufficient to make
you complete, because He is complete.

30:19.632 --> 30:28.303
And as it is, for you people to do it, it
is easier, because you are already at a point

30:28.303 --> 30:40.072
where Ganesha is pleased.

30:40.072 --> 30:45.842
Or we can say that you are pleased with yourself.

30:45.842 --> 30:51.422
So one should not feel that, or should not
feel bad.

30:51.422 --> 30:59.862
If someone feels hurt or something, that means
there is something lacking in that person.

30:59.862 --> 31:16.112
Such a personality is the personality where
we can say that Shri Ganesha is residing with

31:16.112 --> 31:19.612
all His powers.

31:19.612 --> 31:29.812
But some people have the right Ganesha and
some people have the left Ganesha powers.

31:29.812 --> 31:39.192
Both the types of powers must be developed.

31:39.192 --> 31:46.222
If a man has been licentious and very fond
of the other sex and all that, he gets such

31:46.222 --> 32:05.913
a rebound that he be comes an ‘absolutely’
left-side character.

32:05.913 --> 32:10.993
Supposing before realisation he is running
after women, or the girl is running after the

32:10.993 --> 32:18.122
men, all that, gets such a rebound that, he
just doesn’t want to do that thing, as a

32:18.122 --> 32:39.413
filth, he thinks its filth, that is one of
the feelings that come in the mind of a person,

32:39.413 --> 32:58.462
when he doesn’t hanker after this kind of
nonsense.

32:58.462 --> 33:18.002
Like we have horrible names like heterosexuals
and homosexuals and all sexual sorts.

33:18.002 --> 33:44.222
When you keep a healthy company of your’
type, of your sex, healthy company healthy and pure.

33:44.222 --> 33:53.283
It is very natural.

33:53.283 --> 34:10.732
And the another extreme nature should
not be followed.

34:10.732 --> 34:17.572
Like, I have also seen among some muslims, this is a habit,
that they are more attached to their daughters

34:17.572 --> 34:19.132
than to their wives.

34:19.132 --> 34:20.523
Funny thing.

34:20.523 --> 34:24.342
It is absurd.

34:24.342 --> 34:30.333
They pay more importance to the daughters
than to the wife -it is something very absurd,

34:30.333 --> 34:32.113
it is not good.

34:32.113 --> 34:35.502
It’s again perversion.

34:35.502 --> 34:47.643
Or the women, they love their son more than
their husband.

34:47.643 --> 34:52.433
It is absurd.

34:52.433 --> 34:57.223
And once it starts working like that, it can
go to any absurd limit, which is not in the

34:57.223 --> 35:04.293
‘maryadas’ in the boundaries of Sahaja
Yoga.

35:04.293 --> 35:19.733
There has to be very healthy relationship.

35:19.733 --> 35:30.743
Friendship, but not attachment which looks
funny and absurd.

35:30.743 --> 35:32.652
So nothing absurd should be done.

35:32.652 --> 35:35.922
No thing overly should be done.

35:35.922 --> 35:48.043
Because there will be remorse and unnecessary
heart burning for nothing at all, it is useless.

35:48.043 --> 35:56.973
Now, in Sahaja Yoga another very important
point I have to tell you today, which is not

35:56.973 --> 36:01.643
so much besides Shri Ganesha’s point, which we always make mistakes.

36:01.643 --> 36:17.753
Then in India there have been lots of
Mistakes like that: Now I give you one example

36:17.753 --> 36:18.753
of Mr.

36:18.753 --> 36:29.882
X who is a great Sahaja Yogi, in the sense
that he is a great organiser he has done this,

36:29.882 --> 36:35.733
he has done that, and we start adoring him.

36:35.733 --> 36:38.983
Or we may be jealous.

36:38.983 --> 36:43.912
One of the two things happen, either we adore
or we are jealous.

36:43.912 --> 36:48.983
Now, if you adore that person, then you must
follow his footsteps.

36:48.983 --> 37:01.372
And if you are jealous, then it is more reason
that you follow his footsteps so you become

37:01.372 --> 37:02.833
like him.

37:02.833 --> 37:08.912
I am talking of wisdom.

37:08.912 --> 37:20.652
Now, but instead of that when you adore -even
whether you are a boy or a girl, you will

37:20.652 --> 37:35.173
jump on him, you will hug him and kiss him,
you do all kinds of non sensical things.

37:35.173 --> 37:38.373
Which is ‘not needed’ to express that
way.

37:38.373 --> 37:43.192
Like it happened with me that I was in London
for the first time.

37:43.192 --> 37:54.412
I’d never known all this, and somebody who
was quite hefty just came and hugged me, and

37:54.412 --> 38:10.773
I didn’t know what was the word in this
language.

38:10.773 --> 38:23.483
So I told him in marathi “Put me down”.

38:23.483 --> 38:30.183
So it is quite funny.

38:30.183 --> 38:43.583
I am not used to kissing at all, ‘at all’.

38:43.583 --> 38:52.363
Anybody kisses me, I get a fright you know.

38:52.363 --> 39:03.352
I can kiss a lady or a little boy that is
all right, that is done, but not every man,

39:03.352 --> 39:11.023
I cannot kiss -it’s very funny, isn’t
it?

39:11.023 --> 39:17.452
So this kind of adoration is not very wise.

39:17.452 --> 39:23.843
Adoration is to be felt in your heart.

39:23.843 --> 39:29.253
Like yesterday one of the gentlemen put his
hand so strong on me, that for two minutes

39:29.253 --> 39:35.853
I was just trying to put it right.

39:35.853 --> 39:44.073
And this shaking hands is a very horrible
thing.

39:44.073 --> 39:47.632
Sometimes they cannot feel alright unless
and until they have taken about a kilo of

39:47.632 --> 39:48.632
Meat out.

39:48.632 --> 40:02.573
…And this is how sometimes, there are no
maryadas’ left, even among ourselves.

40:02.573 --> 40:13.133
So there should be maryadas.

40:13.133 --> 40:27.192
Now feeling jealousy is another thing.

40:27.192 --> 40:39.253
I have seen that when people feel jealous,
they start coming and complaining against

40:39.253 --> 40:50.692
this person or that person -I know it is.

40:50.692 --> 40:52.973
Jealousy is the worst curse ever we can have,
I think, because then you can’t see anything

40:52.973 --> 40:53.973
that is good.

40:53.973 --> 41:01.283
Because you see a person is normal, you feel
jealous of such a person.

41:01.283 --> 41:15.333
Then you feel, you are jealous so you have
every right to do what you like.

41:15.333 --> 41:21.442
You just say,” I am jealous of you, because
you are so good.

41:21.442 --> 41:32.662
So, now I can be very bad.

41:32.662 --> 41:36.692
I mean at first it started with people telling
that this is jealousy which is a bad thing;

41:36.692 --> 41:37.692
it was all right.

41:37.692 --> 41:45.063
But now the bad thing is taken as blackmail,
you see, you use it.

41:45.063 --> 41:49.083
for blackmailing others, that, “Oh, alright!

41:49.083 --> 41:51.842
I am a bad man, so I am a bad man.

41:51.842 --> 42:00.122
You are a good man, alright, So what?”

42:00.122 --> 42:03.723
Just like that.

42:03.723 --> 42:10.083
To use it as a power.

42:10.083 --> 42:12.622
Like yesterday one madman came, a lunatic.

42:12.622 --> 42:21.003
Now when this lunatic came, he wanted to sit
in the front.

42:21.003 --> 42:33.043
And he just started taking advantage of his
lunacy!

42:33.043 --> 42:34.202
That if he is a lunatic, he can behave the
way he likes.

42:34.202 --> 42:39.413
Because you are a drunkard you can behave
the way you like.

42:39.413 --> 42:41.493
Now, what is the wisdom?

42:41.493 --> 42:45.523
Where is it lost?

42:45.523 --> 42:48.543
It is ridiculous.

42:48.543 --> 42:54.593
So, one has to be wise.

42:54.593 --> 43:01.243
When you are dealing with it, the wisdom is
your glory.

43:01.243 --> 43:12.393
By wisdom you will be fair to yourself and
fair to others.

43:12.393 --> 43:18.813
Wisdom is like an ocean, one can not describe
it

43:18.813 --> 43:23.713
in one lecture.

43:23.713 --> 43:33.513
Just try to enjoy your wisdom.

43:33.513 --> 43:37.323
And the greatest wisdom of Shri Ganesha was
that he was surrendered to his Mother, that

43:37.323 --> 43:38.763
is all; he is not bothered.

43:38.763 --> 43:51.902
And when you
are surrendered then you just understand that

43:51.902 --> 44:04.813
you give up your ego and superego to
your Mother to bother about it, and you live

44:04.813 --> 44:11.773
with your innocence.

44:11.773 --> 44:21.273
And to understand also in a very gross way,
we can say, to have Ganesha tattva (Principle)

44:21.273 --> 44:29.803
developed in you, you must eat things which
are emitting Ganesha Principle.

44:29.803 --> 44:32.202
Like the Chana, like, I have found out, the
Hazelnut.

44:32.202 --> 44:43.233
Then you can see that you should use a lot
of these lemons, is a good idea.

44:43.233 --> 44:55.303
All these give you a good Ganesha Tattva.

44:55.303 --> 45:12.723
So all these things should be used, and there
are many other things one can see that, which

45:12.723 --> 45:15.323
help you to develop your Ganesha Tattva.

45:15.323 --> 45:24.513
But the highest of all is to control your
eyes.

45:24.513 --> 45:32.753
Not to see anything that is tempting.

45:32.753 --> 45:38.452
So put your eyes on the ground.

45:38.452 --> 45:52.362
Just watch your eyes when another sex arrives,
how do you look at that person, with greed,

45:52.362 --> 45:58.192
with lust.

45:58.192 --> 46:12.622
And if you understand that then you will start
clearing your eyes very well.

46:12.622 --> 46:20.142
Another thing is physically you should try
to do one or two exercises to be able to put

46:20.142 --> 46:31.463
yourself flat on the Mother Earth, because
that helps.

46:31.463 --> 46:40.412
So before doing the meditation to Shri Ganesha,
you must first do that exercise, to loosen

46:40.412 --> 46:55.763
the muscles so that you should touch the Mother
Earth in a more flat way.

46:55.763 --> 47:01.902
It will help.

47:01.902 --> 47:12.803
So for today I think I have said sufficiently.
