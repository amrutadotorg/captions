01:41.628 --> 01:46.698
1995-08-24 Public Program, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

01:47.043 --> 01:51.480
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

01:58.251 --> 02:04.884
At the very outset, I have to say truth is what it is.

02:08.975 --> 02:14.240
You cannot change it; you cannot transform it.

02:18.659 --> 02:24.081
You cannot describe it, but you have to experience it.

02:33.556 --> 02:36.895
Whatever I am going to tell you here today,

02:37.095 --> 02:41.462
you need not take it for granted.

02:45.420 --> 02:51.381
We have had lots of problems with blind faith.

02:54.519 --> 02:58.889
So, whatever I am saying, if it is proved,

02:59.089 --> 03:03.230
then you have to accept it.

03:08.202 --> 03:12.715
Because it is for your benevolence,

03:12.916 --> 03:19.070
for the benevolence of your family, benevolence of your country

03:19.270 --> 03:24.556
and benevolence of the whole World.

03:36.308 --> 03:44.139
If you see in modern times, people are very restless.

03:50.421 --> 03:54.033
And there is no peace within.

03:56.150 --> 04:02.736
This restlessness starts when you try to find the truth.

04:08.434 --> 04:12.419
You may not be aware of it.

04:13.414 --> 04:17.296
But it exists.

04:18.609 --> 04:24.427
I am very happy to see so many people here in Brazil,

04:24.627 --> 04:29.252
in Rio, who are seeking the truth.

04:36.279 --> 04:44.867
At the very outset, again, I would
like to tell you what is the truth.

04:49.672 --> 04:54.258
The first thing is when you say this is my body,

04:54.458 --> 04:57.852
these are my hands, this is my intelligence,

04:58.052 --> 05:03.013
we talk of ‘my, my, my!’

05:11.346 --> 05:15.521
But who is the owner of this 'I'.

05:18.029 --> 05:23.318
This owner is your spirit.

05:25.560 --> 05:31.179
Actually, you are not this body, this mind, you are not your emotions,

05:31.380 --> 05:36.975
your intelligence, you are not your ego and your conditionings

05:37.176 --> 05:41.671
but you are pure spirit.

05:52.197 --> 05:55.989
Unless and until you become,

05:56.189 --> 06:04.208
unless and until you become the
spirit, you are going to be restless.

06:10.429 --> 06:16.507
That is what Christ has said, that you have to be born again.

06:21.202 --> 06:28.238
It is not like branding yourself "I am
born again", but it’s an experience.

06:33.385 --> 06:37.564
And you become the spirit.

06:39.049 --> 06:43.903
And you get all the powers of the spirit.

06:47.684 --> 06:53.267
There is another truth, which we have to know about.

06:56.056 --> 07:01.637
You see all this beautiful flowers, it’s a miracle.

07:06.377 --> 07:12.470
But they take it, take them for granted, you take them for granted.

07:16.780 --> 07:21.679
And we never think how they have been created.

07:24.413 --> 07:29.340
We don’t know anything about the living process.

07:32.543 --> 07:39.907
For example, if you ask a doctor who runs your heart,

07:44.954 --> 07:49.889
he’ll say it is an autonomous nervous system.

08:38.878 --> 08:44.698
So, you can ask who is this auto?

08:47.696 --> 08:52.165
In the same way, I have to tell you that

08:52.365 --> 08:59.550
there is all pervading power of divine love,

09:04.659 --> 09:08.531
which is a subtle energy.

09:10.813 --> 09:14.430
Which does all the living work.

09:16.125 --> 09:23.911
It has also done our evolution and we have come to this human level.

09:31.196 --> 09:37.058
But at this human level, we live in a world which is relative,

09:37.258 --> 09:41.331
it is not absolute.

09:46.307 --> 09:51.045
Why we have to know the absolute truth?

09:53.545 --> 09:58.431
Once we have an absolute truth, then there will be no quarrel,

09:58.631 --> 10:02.683
no fights, no wars.

10:10.092 --> 10:17.850
And all of them, all of you, will know the same truth.

10:21.634 --> 10:26.738
This is what has happened so far that everybody thinks

10:26.938 --> 10:29.687
this is the truth and another one thinks this is the truth,

10:29.887 --> 10:33.730
and they are just fighting.

10:39.673 --> 10:45.032
No religion is exclusive, you should understand this point.

10:48.801 --> 10:55.058
When Christ came, He talked about Abraham and about Moses.

11:00.259 --> 11:05.134
So it was not exclusive religion He established.

11:07.423 --> 11:11.126
Then came Mohammed Sahib, he talked about Abraham,

11:11.326 --> 11:18.889
about Moses, about Christ, also about
the Mother of Christ with great respect.

11:27.792 --> 11:32.563
So, Islam is also not an exclusive religion.

11:35.859 --> 11:43.800
The growth of spiritual life is described in every incarnation like that.

11:48.112 --> 11:52.904
But now we are fighting in the name of God.

11:57.498 --> 12:03.456
Not only that, but among the Christians, among the Muslims,

12:03.656 --> 12:08.376
among the Jews, they are fighting among each other.

12:16.426 --> 12:18.499
But once you know the absolute truth,

12:18.699 --> 12:24.382
then you realize that all these religions came on this Earth,

12:30.798 --> 12:36.361
as beautiful fowers of one tree of spirituality,

12:40.012 --> 12:43.804
at different times.

12:44.004 --> 12:51.452
And now we have plucked the flowers
and fighting with the dead flowers,

12:55.530 --> 12:59.291
bringing bad name to all those great incarnations

12:59.491 --> 13:04.033
who came on this Earth to save us.

13:09.924 --> 13:18.036
So, as it is, [inaudible]

13:18.236 --> 13:26.500
you have been already described about the
subtle system we have within ourselves.

13:30.068 --> 13:34.411
That works out this ascent.

13:38.872 --> 13:47.841
This triangular bone is called as the sacrum,
where this power of Kundalini resides.

13:53.845 --> 13:58.717
That means the Greeks knew it was a sacred bone.

14:03.460 --> 14:08.311
Now, this resides in every individual.

14:12.111 --> 14:16.470
She is your own individual mother.

14:18.895 --> 14:23.231
She knows everything about you.

14:25.465 --> 14:32.434
Like a tape recorder, she has taped all that you have aspired,

14:32.634 --> 14:36.783
all that was your past.

14:44.702 --> 14:48.686
So, it’s your own power,

14:51.702 --> 14:55.053
which is to be awakened.

14:55.904 --> 15:04.540
It is like a seed which is put in the
Mother Earth and sprouts by itself.

15:10.126 --> 15:19.483
Now, the problem is that you have to understand that

15:19.683 --> 15:25.111
what life we are having today is extremely chaotic.

15:25.311 --> 15:28.538
Chaotic.

15:33.218 --> 15:35.325
You don’t know about your children,

15:35.525 --> 15:39.700
what drugs they will take. You don’t know about anyone,

15:39.900 --> 15:44.455
what wrong life they have lived.

15:48.692 --> 15:54.731
By forcing people to take to morality doesn’t work out at all.

15:59.251 --> 16:02.496
So something more has to happen to us

16:02.696 --> 16:07.298
that we develop our own personality.

16:12.233 --> 16:16.475
That we have our own identity.

16:18.853 --> 16:23.017
That we know why are we on this Earth.

16:27.665 --> 16:30.123
So, I was telling you about the second proof that

16:30.323 --> 16:35.446
there’s an all pervading power of divine love.

16:41.840 --> 16:49.624
In the Bible, it is said ‘Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost’, is called as.

16:54.889 --> 16:59.209
In the Koran, it is called as ‘Ruh’.

17:01.404 --> 17:07.544
And in the Indian scripture it is called as ‘Paramchaitanya’.

17:11.294 --> 17:16.713
Whatever you may call it, it exists.

17:20.143 --> 17:31.157
It thinks, it organizes, understands, it works out..works out,

17:31.357 --> 17:35.891
controls the nature,

17:40.867 --> 17:44.531
ultimately it loves.

17:47.411 --> 17:50.985
So you might find many coincides happening in your life,

17:51.185 --> 17:55.078
which you cannot explain.

17:58.719 --> 18:02.550
And you are surprised,

18:02.750 --> 18:07.139
these coincides happen because of the guidance

18:07.339 --> 18:12.105
of this all-pervading power of divine love.

18:19.076 --> 18:24.392
So, when this power rises within us into six centres,

18:24.592 --> 18:27.520
it pierces through our fontanelle bone area

18:27.720 --> 18:32.837
and becomes one with the all-pervading power.

18:45.800 --> 18:49.933
This union is the yoga,

18:51.722 --> 18:55.155
where you become one with this power

18:55.355 --> 19:01.990
and from your hands cool breeze like vibrations start flowing.

19:08.579 --> 19:11.050
In…with these vibrations

19:11.251 --> 19:15.892
you can know what’s wrong with your centres.

19:21.558 --> 19:25.316
You know about yourself,

19:26.233 --> 19:30.241
that means this is self-knowledge.

19:31.413 --> 19:35.897
Then you can know about others also,

19:38.002 --> 19:42.994
because you become collectively conscious.

19:46.159 --> 19:49.100
Your awareness gets a new dimension

19:49.300 --> 19:54.214
that you can feel the centres of others.

19:59.236 --> 20:08.271
These centres, are there which cater to our
physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual being.

20:15.438 --> 20:18.801
When they get exhausted or weaken,

20:19.001 --> 20:25.412
then you develop all kinds of physical, mental, emotional diseases.

20:34.183 --> 20:42.229
So when the Kundalini rises she nourishes
all these centres and corrects them,

20:46.276 --> 20:54.213
and connects you to that all-pervading
power, the source of vital energy.

20:58.583 --> 21:07.286
So, you get rid of your diseases and you become healthy person.

21:11.031 --> 21:14.816
In India, we have got four doctors now,

21:15.016 --> 21:20.358
who have got MD for curing people

21:20.558 --> 21:27.284
with Sahaja Yoga of their diseases, which are incurable.

21:38.788 --> 21:42.801
So, you know how to cure others,

21:44.988 --> 21:48.902
you know how to cure yourself,

21:50.610 --> 21:53.731
you become extremely dynamic with this force,

21:53.931 --> 21:58.016
also extremely compassionate.

22:01.660 --> 22:06.257
Many children who were very bad students have suddenly become

22:06.457 --> 22:10.663
extremely intelligent and successful.

22:18.757 --> 22:24.894
Thus all your problems, even financial problems are solved.

22:28.683 --> 22:33.392
It is fantastic, the way I am saying things to you,

22:33.592 --> 22:38.452
you might think that is something out of the blue,

22:44.041 --> 22:49.330
but you don’t know you are fantastic,

22:50.142 --> 22:52.739
you are glorious.

22:52.939 --> 22:57.403
You are glorious.

22:57.603 --> 23:01.864
But unless and until, you are connected to the mains,

23:02.071 --> 23:05.790
you don’t know yourself.

23:10.364 --> 23:14.094
Supposing this thing is not connected to the mains,

23:14.294 --> 23:18.973
it has no identity.

23:25.689 --> 23:31.044
Moreover, you give up all that is destructive.

23:36.020 --> 23:40.128
We have in America, if you see people ideas

23:40.328 --> 23:45.843
that you should enjoy every moment of your life.

23:51.911 --> 23:56.583
And all their enjoyments are self-destructive.

24:00.062 --> 24:03.175
They are saying that within ten years’ time,

24:03.375 --> 24:09.734
65% of Americans will be mad or schizophrenic.

24:18.604 --> 24:24.638
Or they will have other horrible diseases which are incurable.

24:28.036 --> 24:34.681
Because their lifestyle is absolutely unwise, immature.

24:40.765 --> 24:45.229
But if I say that, they won’t listen to me.

24:45.429 --> 24:50.273
If I tell them, they won’t listen to me.

24:51.575 --> 24:58.070
But if they get connected and the light
of the spirit comes in their attention,

24:58.270 --> 25:02.859
then they are completely transformed.

25:10.226 --> 25:16.229
I am talking of global transformation.

25:17.651 --> 25:21.718
Sahaja Yoga is working in 65 nations.

25:25.328 --> 25:31.520
In Russia, in one program you cannot get less than 16,000 people.

25:38.114 --> 25:42.093
On the whole, they are not so materialistic.

25:45.375 --> 25:52.041
And at least, I would say 60% people are extremely spiritual.

25:57.698 --> 26:03.335
I just don’t understand how they have such deep spirituality.

26:10.132 --> 26:14.965
All other false gurus have been banned.

26:18.278 --> 26:21.351
That’s also very wise thing to do…

26:21.551 --> 26:25.369
that’s also very wise thing to do.

26:27.189 --> 26:31.403
Because there are so many seekers and they fall into traps

26:31.603 --> 26:36.489
of these people who just want to make money.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.898
You cannot pay for God or for spirituality.

26:53.166 --> 27:01.612
What do we pay to this Mother Earth,
which gives us such beautiful flowers?

27:06.158 --> 27:09.830
It is all built-in within you.

27:12.194 --> 27:16.299
And it just works spontaneously, Sahaja,

27:21.612 --> 27:25.617
you don’t have to pay for it.

27:26.703 --> 27:31.914
It is something so invaluable.

27:37.065 --> 27:42.813
As a result of this happening, you become enlightened.

27:46.449 --> 27:50.472
Your attention becomes enlightened.

27:52.167 --> 28:03.334
And if you pay attention to anything, you can solve the problem.

28:07.735 --> 28:15.665
You must know that this all- pervading power is full of blessings.

28:20.363 --> 28:25.809
It guides you, and it protects you.

28:29.462 --> 28:35.853
It is to be in the Kingdom of God.

28:38.863 --> 28:48.505
And the government of God is extremely alert and is very efficient.

28:52.893 --> 28:57.807
You jump into the ocean of joy.

29:01.802 --> 29:06.466
And you feel extremely secure.

29:08.802 --> 29:14.957
Once Sahaja Yogis meet together

29:15.157 --> 29:19.829
they have nothing but pure love.

29:24.261 --> 29:29.292
There is no greed and there is no lust.

29:32.498 --> 29:37.154
Sahaja Yoga has created many beautiful families.

29:41.222 --> 29:45.777
And also the children are very beautiful.

29:48.136 --> 29:52.131
So, this is the judgement time.

29:54.045 --> 29:59.686
You have to judge, yourself.

30:01.626 --> 30:07.587
And you will know whether you want the truth or falsehood.

30:11.702 --> 30:19.252
It’s working out everywhere and I am happy now in Brasil, in Rio,

30:19.453 --> 30:24.050
there are so many people who are seeking.

30:30.151 --> 30:36.393
So we'll have today here, tonight, the experience.

30:42.396 --> 30:48.724
But, you must have a pure desire to get it.

30:53.258 --> 30:57.047
That’s all is needed.

30:57.789 --> 31:04.028
And it will work for all of you, I promise.

31:08.208 --> 31:17.664
But if you are rude, adamant, and
don’t want it, it cannot be forced.

31:24.255 --> 31:28.599
It will take hardly ten minutes.

31:29.590 --> 31:36.582
But I request that nobody should walk out during that time.

31:41.693 --> 31:47.256
I have already told you that I cannot force it on you.

31:51.667 --> 31:55.675
Actually you have to ask for it.

31:57.834 --> 32:02.506
If you want, you will get it.

32:06.146 --> 32:09.683
So for ten minutes you have to keep quiet

32:09.883 --> 32:15.766
and if you do not want to have it, you should leave the hall.

32:26.631 --> 32:33.382
I have already told you it is your own power,

32:33.583 --> 32:37.176
there is no obligation.

32:55.507 --> 33:00.447
If you can all be seated, it would be better.

33:46.390 --> 33:51.304
There are very simple three conditions.

33:58.181 --> 34:07.973
The first one is that all of you have to be very confident about it,

34:14.671 --> 34:19.960
that means you must forgive yourself,

34:22.593 --> 34:26.949
you should not feel guilty at all.

34:29.020 --> 34:32.585
At this moment, please remember that

34:32.785 --> 34:39.695
this all-pervading power is the ocean of forgiveness.

34:45.215 --> 34:50.578
And you cannot do anything that cannot be

34:50.778 --> 34:57.210
completely dissolved by the power of this ocean of love.

35:04.968 --> 35:09.708
So, please forgive yourself.

35:12.416 --> 35:14.575
Don't believe in people who say that you are sinners

35:14.775 --> 35:19.307
or something like that. Just don't believe in them.

35:23.889 --> 35:25.824
Because if you feel guilty,

35:26.025 --> 35:30.443
then the centre on the left hand side catches very much.

35:37.013 --> 35:42.583
And physically you are hurt,

35:44.899 --> 35:51.914
you get what you call Angina as one of the diseases.

35:55.659 --> 35:59.730
Or you might get Spondylitis.

36:01.698 --> 36:08.983
Or you might get what you call the lethargic organs.

36:14.339 --> 36:18.870
So why have this guilt?

36:19.745 --> 36:23.683
Actually you have to respect yourself.

36:27.717 --> 36:35.347
The third condition is you have to forgive everyone.

36:39.402 --> 36:45.068
Whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

36:49.709 --> 36:58.665
But if you don’t forgive, then you fall into bad hands

37:03.642 --> 37:07.910
because you torture yourself.

37:09.582 --> 37:14.465
While the person who has troubled you is a happy person.

37:18.225 --> 37:23.858
So don’t also think about them, because it’s a headache.

37:27.572 --> 37:32.158
And you will feel very relaxed with that.

37:37.030 --> 37:46.027
So again, these are the three simple
conditions that you have to follow.

37:51.027 --> 37:56.350
It will help if you can take out the shoes.
