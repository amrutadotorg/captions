00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:11.280
Today is a sad day because such a great man
like Sadat is dead.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.480
He is not great to Me because he was a great
politician or he was president, but he was

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.570
a saint, he was a realized soul, I knew all
about him.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:35.611
The attack of the negativity is on but no
more they will crucify a saint this way and

00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:39.079
will not face the punishment.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.410
They will be punished now.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:53.749
All those who tried to do such things will
be punished because the new age has started.

00:00:53.749 --> 00:01:05.269
Today I wanted to tell you about the Agya
chakra, about Jesus Christ who adorns this

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.619
center of Agya chakra, where you see the red
mark.

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:23.501
Behind that, inside, in the brain on the crossing
of the optic chiasm is this subtle center

00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:34.760
where this great Deity is placed through His
crucifixion and through His Resurrection.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.939
He has created this space for us to enter
into the Kingdom of God, which is placed within

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:41.939
us.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:55.320
Is not in without, is the limbic area that
surrounds your ego and superego.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.210
In the Puranas, in the ancient scriptures
of India, Christ is described so very clearly.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:10.640
Actually in the Bible what they saw of Him
when He was on this Earth was written down.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.710
But nothing what created Him, how He came
on this Earth what is the spirit of Christ,

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.130
what is the seat of Christ and how He came
and what is His purpose and where does He

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.130
stand within us.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.400
All these things are not described in the
Bible as I told you the people at that time

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:40.410
were not at all aware of His greatness, of
His special Incarnation.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:50.360
But if you read some of these ancient books
you’ll find that He was called as Mahavishnu

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.190
in the Devi Purana, in the Goddess Purana,
is the ancient scripture of the Goddess.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.160
Mahavishnu was created immaculately.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:17.380
Now when we say that Christ always pointed
out this pick is very significant.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:26.900
Actually this, this means Vishuddhi chakra
and means also America.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.020
But this also means Vishuddhi chakra stands
for Shri Krishna as I told you and He is the

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:43.510
Primordial Being, and He is the epitome of
our evolution in the sense that He is the

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:51.320
Primordial Being who is the Father, who is
the preserver.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:58.450
Now in the Puranas He is described that His
power was Radha, Radha.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:05.100
Sanskrit language is absolutely very scientific
as far as the Divine Laws are concerned.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.440
Ra means the energy, dha means the one that
sustains.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:16.780
[SANSKRIT TALK] She is the one who sustains
the energy and She was His power.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.090
But in India Krishna is never taken as Krishna
Radha but Radha Krishna.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.060
The energy is before the deity.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.430
The lady is before the gentleman, we can say.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.789
Radha Krishna.

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:42.950
Now this special happening took place long
time back.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:52.160
This is at the stage of Vaikunta as we call
it, at the stage where nothing existed as

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.060
far as this world was concerned.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.100
At different stages it came up.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:05.980
We see the world in such a way that it was
created in seven days, but actually these

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.710
are seven stages in when this whole Universe
was created and we are at the seventh stage,

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.940
we can say.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:20.640
Now at the first Vaikunta stage where it was
all decided, how to work it out the creation

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:29.620
of this great personality, of the Son of God,
the greatest of all, the Adhara, the support

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.040
of the universe, this Mahavishnu.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:40.880
So Radha, She’s Mahalakshmi, She is the
central path.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:50.620
First She created Him in the Vaikunta stage.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:06:01.021
And at that stage She decided that She’ll
create It by Herself this great Incarnation

00:06:01.021 --> 00:06:05.710
and She created this Mahavishnu.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:14.290
I would like you to get the translation of
the description of Mahavishnu and also the

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:23.460
description of Ganesha who is the Spirit of
Christ and who incarnated in this, on this

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.980
earth as our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:45.419
So we have here an Incarnation, a very special
one, which was conceived thousands and thousands

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:54.620
of years back at this level where it’s only
the activity of the God’s mind was there,

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:04.880
Vaikunta stage, where it was decided that
this power called Radha will conceive Him

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.020
in Her heart.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:13.280
And She conceived Him in Her heart.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.949
And then He was made like an egg.

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:23.020
See the symbolism of Easter, like an egg.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.370
Can you recognize it?

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.560
People knew about it somehow.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.290
Why do we have Easter, eggs?

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:36.180
We never think about it.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:46.990
He was created like an egg out of which the
half of it was kept as the seed, as Shri Ganesha,

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:53.090
as the Spirit, and a half of it was created
as Jesus Christ.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:08:05.370
The whole egg was nothing but the egg of this
Divine power, which has to manifest this Divine

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:09.220
power on this Earth.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:19.220
This story is very beautiful, how She created
and then He asked: “Who is my Father?”

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:23.870
Radha is nobody else but Mother Mary Herself.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.480
She is Mahalakshmi.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.479
People may say that they can’t believe in
immaculate birth of Christ.

00:08:30.479 --> 00:08:32.950
They cannot believe in the conception of Christ.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:38.349
I mean you it’s easy for people to say:”
We don’t believe.”

00:08:38.349 --> 00:08:40.469
What do they know about God?

00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:43.509
What do they know about His mysterious ways
of doing it?

00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:51.199
Can you say how you convert or you transform
a flower into a fruit?

00:08:51.199 --> 00:09:00.620
You don’t know anything about living miracles
and you start doubting the Immaculate Conception.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:06.800
Here, when you got your Realization I conceived
you in My heart and gave you Realization through

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.430
My Sahasrara.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.540
How did you get your Realization?

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.709
You never thought of it.

00:09:14.709 --> 00:09:16.019
Is an impossibility.

00:09:16.019 --> 00:09:18.029
Thousands of people are getting Realization.

00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:19.209
How is it possible?

00:09:19.209 --> 00:09:24.970
There must be something special about Me and
about the way it is done.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:31.519
In the same way She conceived and gave Him
the birth through Her uterus.

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:37.819
You can move it anywhere on your central system.

00:09:37.819 --> 00:09:54.990
And this great Incarnation came on this Earth
with such a special purpose that He was nothing

00:09:54.990 --> 00:10:05.199
but Pranava, is the, this integrated power,
this great power which has all the powers

00:10:05.199 --> 00:10:09.730
in it: the Iccha Shakti, the Prana Shakti
and the Dharma Shakti is the central path,

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:14.639
all of these put together.

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:30.839
He was nothing but energy, energy put into
an egg because He had to do a very great job.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:46.220
So this Radha Herself, this Mahalakshmi, this
Mother Mary conceived this child and to name

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:51.170
Him after Krishna who was the Father.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.329
She called Him Christ.

00:10:53.329 --> 00:10:59.929
Christ come from the word ... In Indian language
is, we call Him Krist, Krishna.

00:10:59.929 --> 00:11:05.850
Krishna means the one who has sown the seed.

00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:06.850
He is the Father.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.270
He points out always to the Father.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:15.470
But in the Puranas it is described that Krishna
said: “You are higher than Me.

00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.829
I placed You higher than Me”.

00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:29.089
He placed Him, you can imagine that Christ
is at this point and Krishna is at this point.

00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:36.310
He placed higher Him than Him and He said:
“In anywhere people worship Me – Shri

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:40.829
Krishna said – automatically You are worshipped.

00:11:40.829 --> 00:11:47.069
You will be the support, Adhara, of the whole
world.”

00:11:47.069 --> 00:11:55.011
Is wonderful to say that about I think 14000
years or 12000 years back, Markandeya, such

00:11:55.011 --> 00:11:57.779
a great saint was born in India.

00:11:57.779 --> 00:12:04.139
And he has written the complete Ganesha Stotram,
means the complete praise of Ganesha.

00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:12.730
You can see the translation is so beautiful
and that he said: ”You’ll be so humble”.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:24.019
He is the one who is the ninth Incarnation
called as [BAUTHA] among the ten Incarnations.

00:12:24.019 --> 00:12:34.319
That He will be so humble that He will wash
the feet of His disciples.

00:12:34.319 --> 00:12:37.389
All the miracles of Christ are described in
these books.

00:12:37.389 --> 00:12:41.119
But these books are not translated.

00:12:41.119 --> 00:12:51.679
And that He will be the one, when enlightened
within you with the Kundalini, He will take

00:12:51.679 --> 00:13:02.430
away all your karmas and all your conditionings
because He will die for your sins, for your

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.949
karmas.

00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:15.689
The world will not have to suffer anymore,
if He is awaken within you.

00:13:15.689 --> 00:13:20.490
These are all the things already written,
thousands of years back.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:22.440
Can you imagine?

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:30.389
I wish the Christians who went from here to
take, explain Christianity to Indians told

00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:38.339
them that Mahavishnu is already born and we
are preaching about Him, the One who is going

00:13:38.339 --> 00:13:44.920
to suck your conditioning, the One who is
going to suck all your problems of karmas.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.649
They never told.

00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:54.309
On the contrary, they were so stupid, I must
tell you, that they would put a loaf in a

00:13:54.309 --> 00:14:00.550
well and say that: “You all have become
Christians because we have put the meat of

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:03.249
the beef, the beef inside the well”.

00:14:03.249 --> 00:14:05.929
Indians don’t eat beef, you see.

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:08.069
“So you all have become Christians”.

00:14:08.069 --> 00:14:10.100
Villages after villages they converted into
Christianity.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.389
They started branding them as Christians.

00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:15.319
This was absurd.

00:14:15.319 --> 00:14:22.639
And that’s why the people were waiting and
waiting for the Advent of Christ.

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:32.559
His name Christ comes from the word Krishna,
Krist, and the second one is Jesus.

00:14:32.559 --> 00:14:38.190
Krishna had a foster mother whom Radha loved
very much.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:45.490
Her name was Yeshoda, we also call her as
[Jesoda, Jeshoda].

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:48.110
Christ is called also as [Yesu, Yeshu] in
India.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:55.009
The short form of [Jesoda, Jeshoda] is [Yesu,
Yeshu] or [Jeshu, Jesu] we have both the things.

00:14:55.009 --> 00:14:58.100
From there the name Jesus has come.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:07.550
She wanted to name Her after the foster mother
because she was a lady so she was called as

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:14.639
[Jeshoda, Jesoda] but for a man She selected
the name [Yesu, Yeshu] and [Jeshu, Jesu].

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:23.290
Moreover the word [Jeshu, Jesu] or [Yeshu,
Yesu] is very important.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:30.100
“J” in Sanskrit language means, every
word has a meaning in Sanskrit language, means

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:35.610
to know, is to know, the knowledge, Gyana.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.529
[SANSKRIT TALK].

00:15:37.529 --> 00:15:40.649
The one who knows.

00:15:40.649 --> 00:15:45.199
But [Jeshu, Jesu] [“shu”, “su”] means
auspicious.

00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:51.680
[“Shu”, “Su”] means “that brings
auspiciousness, that brings blessings”.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:57.629
Jeshu is the one who knows how to bring auspiciousness
on this Earth.

00:15:57.629 --> 00:16:06.929
People never told this, they never knew who
went from here with the message that Christ

00:16:06.929 --> 00:16:11.689
was born.

00:16:11.689 --> 00:16:19.089
At the time when Christ came on this Earth
with this big message that somebody has to

00:16:19.089 --> 00:16:22.819
pass through this special problem.

00:16:22.819 --> 00:16:26.290
Now let’s see why the problem was there.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:33.339
We have to understand the problem that faced
human beings at that subtle level where they

00:16:33.339 --> 00:16:41.250
had to work out this special, a very extraordinary
Incarnation.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:48.489
The problem was that human beings had raised
their heads.

00:16:48.489 --> 00:16:57.489
By raising their heads their ego and superego
grew up around their limbic area, making it

00:16:57.489 --> 00:17:04.089
a very hard shell, just like an egg.

00:17:04.089 --> 00:17:13.069
A man developed his I-ness and only way to
transform him into a bird, like an egg breaks

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:19.279
up into a bird, was to make the Kundalini
rise.

00:17:19.279 --> 00:17:28.669
But how to make that compact stuff where it
is crossing, crossable, which can be crossed

00:17:28.669 --> 00:17:32.919
over, which can be passed through.

00:17:32.919 --> 00:17:41.500
So they had to create this special Incarnation,
which is nothing but Pranava, the Aum, the

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:48.639
Logos as you call it, the sound of the All
Pervading Power.

00:17:48.639 --> 00:18:00.310
To be put at a place where nothing but the
power itself can remain, because anybody else,

00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:09.020
all other Incarnations who came on this Earth
had all the five elements within them.

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:14.309
But He was just the power, the energy, the
complete energy.

00:18:14.309 --> 00:18:21.299
He didn’t have, for example we all human
beings are made of five elements on the right

00:18:21.299 --> 00:18:30.910
hand side as I told you, and when we die the
part that is our body, means one of the five

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:35.940
koshas, as they call the cocoons of the body
which is the matter, falls off.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:42.890
Then the water cocoon also falls off and the
soul remains with the Spirit on your head

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.210
and the Kundalini also there.

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:52.770
But He was the only One who had no earth element
in it.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:19:03.809
And so it was a very special type of an energy
engulfed, engulfed into a human being was

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:04.809
placed.

00:19:04.809 --> 00:19:10.289
Krishna has said about the eternal life and
about the Spirit.

00:19:10.289 --> 00:19:17.090
In Sanskrit language is very beautiful because
it’s a mantra: [SANSKRIT].

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:25.470
Means it cannot be killed by anyone, the Spirit
cannot be killed.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.040
It is eternal.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:28.390
You cannot press it.

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:34.940
It cannot be flown out by any wind.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:41.940
And He had to prove it and to prove that they
had to have somebody here, on this Earth,

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:49.559
with that energy to come in, with a body,
to act like a human being, live like a human

00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:59.950
being and go through that drama of death to
show that He overcomes the death.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:06.799
The Resurrection is our message, that He resurrects
Himself.

00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:13.320
He had to die and He had to be resurrected
because He says that it is beyond death.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.179
Krishna has said that the Spirit is beyond
death.

00:20:17.179 --> 00:20:25.409
And the Spirit had to come on this Earth.

00:20:25.409 --> 00:20:34.799
So you understand when we talk of Christ how
little we know as to how this worked out.

00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:40.039
Is the most difficult thing that he did.

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:48.799
And His Mother was the Mahalakshmi, is the
power, which is the central power of sustenance,

00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:53.360
pure sustenance, pure holiness, pure innocence.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:21:00.860
Such a powerful woman She was, very powerful.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:10.220
And Himself is endowed with, you won’t believe,
with eleven powers of Rudra, means of destruction,

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.550
eleven powers of Rudra.

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:12.840
He’s Ekadesha Rudra.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:19.210
Is described, all that is described, I’m
not telling it as My own.

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:23.280
You can see for yourself.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:29.789
He was endowed with eleven powers of destruction.

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:35.600
But He was to go through all this, with all
the humility.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:43.700
When you have all these powers with you and
when egoistical people behave like this, these

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:50.720
donkeys, you see, who could not understand
Him, these brainless people in those days,

00:21:50.720 --> 00:22:01.210
who could not believe Him, He could have destroyed
all of them in one [SHOT, SHUT].

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:04.179
Absolutely He has got eleven Rudras.

00:22:04.179 --> 00:22:11.890
You can imagine His destructive powers, with
which He is going to come back.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.850
And He had to keep them in control.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:24.090
But He didn’t say about His Mother much,
because She was the power and if He had said

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:32.179
so, then they would have directed, these negative
forces would have directed all their attention

00:22:32.179 --> 00:22:37.539
towards Her and then He would have used all
these eleven powers and the whole drama would

00:22:37.539 --> 00:22:38.610
have been failed.

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:40.759
So He kept quiet on that.

00:22:40.759 --> 00:22:46.450
My father, as I told you, was a learned man
and a very great soul and [WE] used to discuss

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:54.680
about these things and I said: “Martin Luther,
who was a Realized soul, when he started his

00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:06.850
new movement of Protestants, why did he not
enhance the glory of the Mother?”

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:13.960
As the Catholics knew, because Catholics just
followed after Christ so it linked about with

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.090
them.

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:22.460
My father told Me that at that time Martin
Luther faced three forces against him.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:29.240
First one was the Christians themselves, the
Catholics, who believed in nunneries and all

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:38.700
kinds of ritualism and all kinds of nonsense,
which he wanted to flout, then he had another

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:46.480
force, which was facing and that one was the
one that came from the Jews because they would

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.960
not accept Him.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.260
Even today they don’t accept Him.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.460
They are very adamant.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:24:02.730
And the third force that he had to face was
the Islam, Islamic.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:13.799
And the Islam pleaded down the role of a woman
though Fatima Herself was the Holy Ghost,

00:24:13.799 --> 00:24:18.750
is the Mahakali power, the daughter of Mohammad.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:26.509
But he pleaded down just because the Islam
had pleaded down he thought gradually as Protestants

00:24:26.509 --> 00:24:36.759
will grow up, he will start introducing the
greatness of His Mother.

00:24:36.759 --> 00:24:46.850
As it is Jews even today are after the Immaculate
Conception.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:52.559
In London, very recently, I think about two
years back, as they have money they paid some

00:24:52.559 --> 00:24:56.450
of the newspapers and published something
nonsensical about Christ.

00:24:56.450 --> 00:25:07.730
They said that it was predicted in the Bible
that a child will be born to a girl, but it

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:15.090
was not a virgin, the Hebrew word, as it is,
is for the girl and not a virgin.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:23.790
I said: “In those days, we didn’t have
girls of 18 years as we have today”.

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:29.130
Even in India today if you say a girl, a [KANYA,]
means a virgin, [KANYA] and virgin is the

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:33.720
same, means the Virgo.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.879
Modern times are funny.

00:25:34.879 --> 00:25:37.790
We can’t judge Christ style according to
modern times.

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:44.730
Even you find a woman who is married ten times
they’ll call her a girl here.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:48.000
But one should logically understand this point.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.850
Is very logical.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:57.860
But if it was to be said that a prophecy means
something special, that a child would be born

00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:03.409
to a girl, of course it is going to be born
to a girl and not to a boy.

00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:06.970
And why was the girl word?

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:08.179
It is going to be born to a boy.

00:26:08.179 --> 00:26:10.889
If it is to a woman it is nothing special.

00:26:10.889 --> 00:26:13.110
What is there to prophesize and say about
it?

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:24.129
Is so logical that when the word girl came
in it meant the virgin.

00:26:24.129 --> 00:26:26.639
All kind of things they are talking, doesn’t
matter.

00:26:26.639 --> 00:26:31.760
First of all they say that our, we have to
suffer till our Savior comes because Christ

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.770
didn’t suffer for them.

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:39.370
So they are suffering.

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:49.500
Now, we have to know that Christ has suffered
for us absolutely to the brim.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.640
We don’t have to suffer anymore.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:27:06.519
Is a nonsensical idea coming from people who
are sadistic, who have no joy in themselves.

00:27:06.519 --> 00:27:08.500
They cannot see you happy.

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:20.309
And that’s why also they make Christ look
like a TB patient, I should say.

00:27:20.309 --> 00:27:30.340
I went to the Sistine Chapel and Michelangelo
was a realized soul, a great person.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:35.179
He has done complete justice to the image
of Christ.

00:27:35.179 --> 00:27:44.519
Huge big thing like a, we can say, a Texas
fellow standing with a lambodara, with a big

00:27:44.519 --> 00:27:46.019
stomach of this kind.

00:27:46.019 --> 00:27:47.539
Ganesha is lambodara.

00:27:47.539 --> 00:27:54.799
Standing there throwing people right and left.

00:27:54.799 --> 00:28:01.840
Just see the words, how He has spoken.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:08.799
He was not a cabbage like person, He was extremely
dynamic, He was full of vigor, He was absolutely

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:09.799
fearless.

00:28:09.799 --> 00:28:13.190
He had nothing to fear.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:19.470
And He’s standing there and throwing people
to the left and the right and the right ones

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:24.090
is accepting them and putting them in the
Kingdom of Heaven.

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:25.090
Just imagine!

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:29.899
It is Michelangelo is the only person who
has really done justice to Him and I would

00:28:29.899 --> 00:28:33.899
say Rubens because of his habits of painting
the muscles, he’s done a very beautiful

00:28:33.899 --> 00:28:40.480
painting, I saw, is in the place where he
lives, of the ascent and descent of Christ.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.090
Beautiful, one of the best one could think.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:48.500
Nowhere miseries written on His face.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:51.179
Such people do not feel the misery.

00:28:51.179 --> 00:28:55.159
They just watch the drama.

00:28:55.159 --> 00:29:07.909
They don’t suffer because of taking up your
sufferings it took it upon Himself and He

00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:18.999
showed to the world that: “Now I ask forgiveness
from My Father”.

00:29:18.999 --> 00:29:27.129
He stood as a representative of all the seekers
of the world before His Father who is a wrathful

00:29:27.129 --> 00:29:28.129
Father.

00:29:28.129 --> 00:29:35.169
I told you Shri Krishna has a Samara Shakti
and worse than that is the witness God whom

00:29:35.169 --> 00:29:37.770
we call as Sadashiva.

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:44.600
He is only there when He has to destroy.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:53.779
And He asks as your representative: “O Father,
please, forgive them”.

00:29:53.779 --> 00:30:03.409
He asks for forgiveness, facing His own Father
as your representative that: “Please, forgive

00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:04.409
them”.

00:30:04.409 --> 00:30:11.019
This is the greatest weapon He has given us,
to forgive.

00:30:11.019 --> 00:30:19.259
That’s one thing none of the Christian nations
are doing, is to forgive.

00:30:19.259 --> 00:30:23.379
Perhaps people have not known the power of
love.

00:30:23.379 --> 00:30:24.379
They do not.

00:30:24.379 --> 00:30:25.379
They talk.

00:30:25.379 --> 00:30:26.379
God is love.

00:30:26.379 --> 00:30:28.159
Just talk, talk, talk, talk.

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:34.090
If God is love then love must be the most
powerful thing.

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:45.370
When I first started My work I flouted all
these fake gurus by names in India and I told

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:49.450
them what devils they had been and I‘ve
known them for ages.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:51.419
And people told Me that: “They will shoot
You this time”.

00:30:51.419 --> 00:30:52.929
I said: “Let them start shooting.

00:30:52.929 --> 00:30:55.049
I’ll se who can shoot Me.”

00:30:55.049 --> 00:30:58.909
[AND ALL THOSE I HAVE] flouted them anywhere
I get the chance.

00:30:58.909 --> 00:31:02.019
I’ve told that: “These are horrible people“.

00:31:02.019 --> 00:31:05.230
As Christ has said: “Hot or cold.”

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:11.230
He doesn’t mind, because if it is cold they
are realized, if they are hot then we’ll

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:12.230
fight them.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.450
We can tell them how.

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:18.830
But if they are one lukewarm, you see, there
are people: “O, we are in different awareness,

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:23.809
they are in different awareness, we must accept
this awareness also, we must accept...”

00:31:23.809 --> 00:31:29.119
Such people are the ones He said: “I’ll
spout them out of My mouth”.

00:31:29.119 --> 00:31:30.169
So clearly.

00:31:30.169 --> 00:31:35.240
He’s the One who whipped people who were
selling things in the temple.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.720
He is the One who said: “Don’t throw pearls
before the swine.”

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:45.490
So far I’ve never used this word but He
has.

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:49.520
He was dynamic.

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.509
He was not afraid of anyone.

00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:57.549
And He couldn’t bear the mediocrity and
this kind of balance: “Oh, we have them

00:31:57.549 --> 00:32:00.190
also, we can have the devils and also the
Gods”.

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:03.210
People argue: “Why do You criticize them?

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:04.940
They don’t criticize You”.

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:11.110
He said: “The devil, the Satan is not going
to speak against his own house”.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:14.820
This is exactly what is happening today.

00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:19.340
I’ve seen when I say that: “This man is
a devil”, people say: “Mother, why do

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.720
you call him a devil?”

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.760
“Because he’s a devil, I have to call
him a devil.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.480
I’m your Mother.”

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:33.309
When I see a person suffering, he cannot get
his Realization because he went to this devil,

00:32:33.309 --> 00:32:35.440
I have to say he’s a devil whether you like
it or not.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:40.830
If you are a true seeker you stand up to that
and see for yourself you are a true seeker.

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:47.940
And if you are a true seeker you must find
your Spirit and you must get to your Realization.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.400
I’m not here for any elections or pampering.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:59.519
I’m here to give you your own, to have your
own Spirit, to enjoy your being.

00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:05.809
Even if the whole world gets against Me, I’m
not bothered about it.

00:33:05.809 --> 00:33:14.059
I’m here of course to look after you, to
tell you in a proper way.

00:33:14.059 --> 00:33:22.740
But if it comes to the devils I will be the
One who will stand against them, every minute.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:27.749
Whatever may they come in, whatever guard,
it’s very easy to make them out once you

00:33:27.749 --> 00:33:28.809
get your Realization.

00:33:28.809 --> 00:33:30.940
It’s very easy to find out.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.330
He Himself has said it all these things.

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.789
He said: “Don’t judge anyone”.

00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:38.200
Before Realization you can’t judge anyone,
from the appearances.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:43.700
They look very sweet, you know, or they talk
very sweetly.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:53.960
They come to you in a band, you see, and they
walk with such beautiful gait.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.130
They are great dramatist, some of them play
tricks, jump like Krishna.

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:00.809
Some say: “We are Incarnation of Christ.”

00:34:00.809 --> 00:34:07.950
There was a gentleman who said: “I’m the
Incarnation of Krishna”.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:13.820
I told him: “Why do you make the ladies
nude and naked?

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:18.750
What religion has taught you this, to make
the ladies nude and naked, take out their

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:21.310
clothes and make them dance?

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:22.310
What is this?”

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:23.880
“O, he said, I’m Shri Krishna!”

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:24.940
I said: “Really?

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.410
I never knew Shri Krishna did that.”

00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:29.170
He said: “No, He did.”

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:34.820
Once Krishna was a small child of four years,
you can imagine, a naughty little thing.

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.960
What did He understand of nudity or that?

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:38.960
Innocent.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:44.850
And the gopis, you see, were having their
bath in the river Yamuna where Radha was putting

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:47.860
Her feet, so the water was all vibrated.

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:56.940
And He climbed up onto a tree and they had
put their clothes on a tree and He hid them.

00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:00.510
So they were asking for His clothes: “Now
what are you doing?

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:01.700
Why have you hidden?”

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.700
It’s a mischief.

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.490
It’s the fun.

00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:07.340
But in that fun what He was doing?

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:12.080
Was to give them Realization because He could
see their Kundalini at the back.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.460
[AS, AND] a child of four years...

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:18.390
What does a child of four years know about
nudity, or dress or anything?

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:19.390
Innocent.

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:23.260
Modern children may be very precautious, but
not in those days.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:27.680
But when He was the king in Dwarika – I
asked this nonsensical fellow who says he

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:35.010
is the Bhagavanan, and the Shri Krishna – I
said when He was a grown up man and a king

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:42.510
in Dwarika, which is at least two thousand
miles away from Hastinapur Delhi, and a lady

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:49.500
called Draupadi, who called Him as a brother,
was troubled because she was pound and all

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:56.050
that, a big story of Mahabharata, you might
be knowing Draupadi, and a devil of a man

00:35:56.050 --> 00:36:01.350
called Dhuriodhana said that: ” I’ll make
you nude”, tried to pull Her sari.

00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:06.090
It’s a beautiful description of the whole
thing.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:14.490
He, He was worried that she will lose her
chastity by removing her..., this is called

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:16.020
as [SANSKRIT WORD].

00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:23.312
So she put it in her mouth like this and she
was to call Krishna.

00:36:23.312 --> 00:36:28.300
She says: “Kri”, and she was holding because
Krishna means “falls down”.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:35.150
And as soon as she found that the sari is
going, she said: ”shna”, and the description

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:37.200
is so great: “[SANSKRIT TALK]”.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:42.940
When she did that “shna” it echoed in
Dwarika where He was ruling.

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:44.230
He was the king there.

00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:53.850
And with shanka, chakra, gada, padma, these
are four weapons, one better that the other.

00:36:53.850 --> 00:37:03.720
One is sufficient, the chakra, I told you,
all up on to on the Garuda, on the condor

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:07.690
He arrived there to save the chastity of His
sister.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:15.560
If He was fond of removing the clothes of
women, why did He all the way come and save

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.560
that?

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.920
And this fellow didn’t know how to answer
Me.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.340
I told him: “One day your clothes will be
taken out like this”.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:25.280
Within eight days it happened.

00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:29.010
Somebody took out all his clothes and he was
dancing on the street and nowadays he’s

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:33.530
backing America with a paralysis.

00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:38.200
He couldn’t smell flowers.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.190
One better that the other.

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.590
But his disciples, if you tell them: “O,
don’t say, Mother.

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:44.990
We love him.”

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:51.180
This kind of a funny mesmerism it’s stupidity.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.570
Awake yourself!

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:59.350
This kind of emotional nonsensical attachment
to one person is not going to give you Realization.

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:01.670
You have to become your Spirit.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:12.160
You have to be actually reborn.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.490
There is no place for devilish people.

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:21.190
If they are from hell they will go back to
that, but many of their disciples are also

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:22.190
walking through.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:25.770
[WHILE, WHY] they are My children, I would
say?

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:37.310
They are the children of God, they are the
men of God, as described as William Blake.

00:38:37.310 --> 00:38:43.240
They have been born on this earth for seeking
because they know this is the time they are

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.980
going to achieve their Realization and these
horrible people have mesmerized them.

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:55.280
At this time should I go and garland them
and say: “You are very nice people”?

00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:00.290
If you expect Me to do that, then you have
not understood Me at all.

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:03.550
No use telling Me: “O, their awareness is
different.”

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:09.940
I see that your Kundalini is ruined, you are
up to get a blood cancer or some sort of a

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:14.680
cancer or you are going to get into the lunatic
asylum.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:18.520
Something horrible is going to happen to you
and when I see that am I to say “Yes”

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.990
the one who has done, go and fall at his feet?

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:26.420
But if there’s a real guru I would go and
meet him Myself.

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:31.370
There are many, but they are hiding.

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:36.750
I sent one fellow to New York, he ran away
within two days, within two days.

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:40.110
He said: “O, these New York people are different”.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.730
He said: “I have to take a circus with me.

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:51.330
They like a circus.”

00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:54.130
But Houston people are different.

00:39:54.130 --> 00:40:04.280
Now, so this was the great Incarnation of
Christ who came on this Earth, a very dynamic.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:11.400
Those who say that: “I’m the Christ”,
there’s many, you see, self certified people:

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.930
“I’m the Christ”.

00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:21.360
Now the kind of a Christ they do, He was never
like that, He was a healthy man and He was

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:27.170
not one of these people who’s these cheeks
have gone inside, who looks like a miserable,

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:29.220
hungry, pitiable man.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.590
[MISSING RECORDING]

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:37.020
[THIS IS] of Holy Ghost, the Kundalini rises.

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:42.650
Is written down.

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:54.840
There are thousand things written and every
word has to be tallied with that person otherwise

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:56.210
you just don’t believe.

00:40:56.210 --> 00:41:13.780
Let them go and walk on the water, is not
far away from you, seventeen miles only, and

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:17.630
see how far they go.

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:19.350
Is the best way to judge these people.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:22.410
We have got a method to judge these people.

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:28.750
Thank God, we are born in modern times when
we are not [ILLITERATE], we have had Christ,

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:35.690
we have had so many people, we can read and
we can understand, we should logically reach

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:41.700
the position to understand what do we have
to expect from a Realized Soul.

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:48.000
If he talks like a politician who wants to
have votes, how can you believe that such

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.160
a person could be an Incarnation?

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:58.930
An Incarnation has not only to be a fearless
person, but has to be a holy person.

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:02.220
Not the one who is like a parasite living
on other people.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.710
Like these lamas [ARE].

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:12.990
They live like parasites in Nepal and also
in Lhasa [UNCLEAR] were suffering.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:23.740
They had no food but these lamas were living
and taking their special Ambrose, they call

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.450
it, in golden cups.

00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:30.250
Today they are driven out so they are on our
head in India.

00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:35.200
We have to support these nonsensical people
sitting down there as lamas, these parasites

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:36.830
of the worst type.

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:42.630
And those who could not get a place there
are now moving about and now they want to

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:45.480
live on a marble flooring.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.080
They can’t live on a carpet flooring.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.350
They must have a marble flooring.

00:42:51.350 --> 00:43:00.270
And people have to starve themselves to create
a marble flooring for these horrible parasites.

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:02.800
Why should a saint ask for anything?

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.910
A saint is a king.

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:08.230
He’s above all these comforts of life.

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:09.830
He’s not bothered.

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:16.130
I mean, if you ask, I can sleep on the street,
I’ve no problem, no problem, because I’m

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:18.950
above the want, I’m above greed.

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:23.580
I don’t know what sort of a thing is temptation.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:34.940
If they call themselves as Godly people, look
at their faces, worn out, biscuity, serious,

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:35.940
nonsensical people.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.500
They have no sense of humor of any kind.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:45.270
Not only but I’ve seen some disciple who
came to Me, all their bone was broken, all

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:49.370
their back bone was broken, every bone was
broken by these people.

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:52.080
They use to beat them [THESE SADISTS].

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:59.380
They take money from you and finish your Kundalini.

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:04.210
Their days have come now.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:08.580
Because they talk well don’t believe them.

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:09.960
What have they given you?

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.800
Somebody says: “They have given us the knowledge”.

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:15.240
All right, what knowledge?

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.010
What knowledge have they given you?

00:44:17.010 --> 00:44:20.370
Knowledge, is all mental.

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:25.770
What have you got it in your awareness, where
you have to evolve, when you rise.

00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:35.220
Christ has described it so clearly, I did
not say what a Realized soul should be.

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:42.890
You become a witness, you become a witness
of the whole drama, of the whole show.

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:45.510
And this should happen to you.

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:50.130
Not only, but you are empowered with the powers
of your Spirit.

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:53.960
At least your health should be all right.

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:59.880
People are suffering from stresses and strain,
having a headache all the time, jumping on

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.190
their sits and they say: “We get very positive
results”.

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:05.900
What are positive results?

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:14.310
These make believes if you carry on with them
you will have no way of judging as to where

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:15.310
you are.

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:19.710
First of all get your Realization.

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:27.160
Get to your discretion power and realize that
it is you can judge them after Realization,

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.160
not before.

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.870
Christ has said “right discretion”.

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:34.940
He has used the word: “right discretion”.

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:40.600
How do you get “right discretion” unless
and until you are realized?

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:45.440
And this is not to be self-certified.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:49.050
As Christ has said: “You’ll be calling
Me Christ, Christ.

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:50.750
I will not recognize you”.

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:51.840
Meaning what?

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:58.900
Those who say: “We are Christians”, you
see, going about with the label: “We are

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:07.010
Christians, we go to church, sing our hymns
and come back home and quarrel, going to wars,

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:08.010
fight.

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:12.930
We are the people who drink on a Christmas
day.

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:18.210
On a Christmas day, we drink!”

00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:24.890
Now, when Christ said that, they said at the
time of Christ, He went to a wedding and He

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:26.290
blessed the wine.

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:27.290
Is not true.

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:34.630
That wine, at that time never meant, even
in India today, wine never means an alcohol.

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:39.520
But Moses has talked about it very clearly
and Abraham has talked about it because they

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:45.880
had to deal with this wine which I told you,
the Primordial Masters, they had to deal with

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:52.290
the liver, so they talked about it, they called
it the “strong drink” and “fermented

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:56.060
drink”, so clearly.

00:46:56.060 --> 00:47:01.000
But everything happens if somebody dies, you
must have champagne to celebrate his death

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
perhaps.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.890
If Christ is born we must have champagne.

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:12.700
If Christ is born that is the day we should
dedicate ourselves to our Spirit, not to get

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.570
out of your awareness.

00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:20.380
Anyone of these fermented things take you
away from your attention.

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:24.790
Your attention is in a way empathized.

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:26.640
I don’t say: “You don’t drink!”

00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:28.700
at this stage but after Realization you will
not.

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:32.370
You will not, even if you want to.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:40.490
You will not drink, because you get drunk.

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:44.750
Like Me, if I go to a party, you see, they
will always say: “Please, have something.

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:45.820
O, You must have, please.

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.060
You have not tested this.

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.290
You better have”.

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:50.550
I said: “No, sir, I’m sorry, I’m over
drunk already.

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:53.570
If I drink more, I don’t know what will
happen to Me”.

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:56.360
I mean you can’t tell them: “You don’t
drink”.

00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:01.540
You see, that would be absolutely [UNLIARLY]
to tell them: “Please, don’t drink today”.

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:05.640
But they’ll go on forcing you and if you
say anything against it then absolutely you

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.720
are no eliteness about you.

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:12.810
You are absolutely unsophisticated.

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:17.070
This is the thing in this world.

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:19.580
Virtue has no meaning.

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:22.600
If you are virtuous, you better hide yourself.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.390
Not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:27.400
You enjoy your virtues in Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.010
You really enjoy yours and others virtues.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:35.640
Is a very different thing as in the unity
church you call it, a New Age is coming, is

00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:36.770
absolutely true.

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:48.840
I find, as I told you the principles of this
church are very, very close to that which

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:53.040
is the stage on to which you have to jump.

00:48:53.040 --> 00:49:03.690
And that’s why the right conclusion that
is reached is absolutely the way to understand

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:04.900
where you have to reach logically.

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:15.910
But you must know, you have to take a stand.

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:23.000
You cannot be a person who’s apologetic.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:27.610
There is no place for apologies.

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:30.090
If you are a realized soul, you are a realized
soul.

00:49:30.090 --> 00:49:32.860
You are not dominating it by that to anyone.

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:34.940
You are not dominating.

00:49:34.940 --> 00:49:44.370
By that you accept your situation with glory
and with pride.

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:52.550
But I’ve seen many Sahaja Yogis also feel
shy to accept that they are realized.

00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:53.970
They understand what’s happening.

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:59.130
They are giggling, they are laughing at the
way people are, but they find it impossible

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:05.330
to talk to them about their Realization, that
other should get their Realization.

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:12.450
You have to take a stand in your family, in
your surroundings, with your friends and you

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:18.230
have to tell them that: “You better all
get realized”.

00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:25.730
The reason for that is that the Christ who
crucified Himself, He is going to come back,

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:32.720
with his eleven forces of destruction.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:39.180
And then He’s not going to tell you anything,
not going to ask you to take any Realization,

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:44.260
nor He is bothered whether you go to hell.

00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:49.810
He will just sort out.

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:57.360
But those who have got Realization will enter
into the Kingdom of God.

00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:59.580
You have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:04.180
Here, as I say, is the seventh chakra.

00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:12.950
I told you about the sixth chakra, which is
adorned by Jesus Christ and the mantra of

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:18.510
the (seventh chakra), sixth chakra is our
Lord’s Prayer.

00:51:18.510 --> 00:51:21.690
That’s the way you can solve both the things.

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:26.780
But the bija mantra is Ham Ksham.

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:28.720
Ham Ksham.

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:39.350
It means that when you are infested with negativity,
with depression, with the attack of the superego,

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:46.350
as shown here, then you have to say: “I
am, I’m going to fight you”.

00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:53.080
If you go to a guru who makes you a negative
person, who makes you feel very shy, who says:

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:58.730
“You are all the ego and you are good for
nothing, you must pay me more and pay me more”.

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:02.450
And you all the time say that: “Oh, must
be something wrong with me, nothing wrong

00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:05.600
with this man”.

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:12.670
If there is self-pity and also there is guilt,
then you have to say: “I am not guilty”.

00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:18.450
Then you have to say that: “I’m my own
guru”, if you have left side problems.

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:25.620
But if you have right side problems, then
you have to say: “I forgive, Ham Ksham”.

00:52:25.620 --> 00:52:33.260
These are the bija mantras of this two, which
you have got, your symbol is of these two

00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:35.860
wings, is actually the Agya chakra.

00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:38.520
It is just like that.

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.710
Agya chakra is just like that.

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:43.800
But they call it the, what Egyptian, what...

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.540
no, is not that.

00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:52.730
You see, this symbol has come to you from
unconscious, is the Agya chakra, is this center.

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:58.320
Egyptians didn’t know much about God, I
must tell you.

00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:02.840
Of course pyramid is, pyramid is, pyramid
is all vibrated.

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:07.310
But the way they were so much worried about
their dead is horrifying.

00:53:07.310 --> 00:53:14.911
Imagine these bones buried in the one box
of gold, then one box of silver, then one

00:53:14.911 --> 00:53:18.150
box of this and all the ornaments kept with
the dead.

00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:20.720
The dead is finished into bones, the ornaments
are there.

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.430
I’ve seen that in Egypt.

00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:26.140
Mad people, I must say.

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:29.760
It’s Sadat who would have brought it round.

00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.360
But lets see something new will happen there,
in that country.

00:53:34.360 --> 00:53:40.290
Traditional countries have wisdom, inbuilt
wisdom and they go on improving because they

00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:43.310
have tried all these methods and they know
[WHERE TO GO].

00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:44.700
He didn’t talk of death.

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:50.190
They know it from the people, pharaohs and
all that who had all these kinds of a funny

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:58.370
mummies going round and keeping the dead in
a silver box and as if the dead knows where

00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:59.790
is the silver.

00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:02.860
Christ has said many things, which we do not
pay attention to.

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:07.140
[NONE, ONE] of them is about the dead.

00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:15.040
In every church, I was happy to know that
in this church there is no cemetery.

00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:18.531
You walk into a cemetery if you want to go
to a church.

00:54:18.531 --> 00:54:23.070
A lady who came from India, she said: “Everything
seems to be upside down in England”.

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:24.070
I said: “What?”

00:54:24.070 --> 00:54:26.160
She said: “I went to see a church.

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:29.270
And all the dead were laid there under my
feet.

00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:31.190
And I was holding my sari walking like this.

00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:33.650
I was thinking I was going to step.

00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:35.930
And the lady with me said: ‘What, you should
walk straight‘.

00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:38.040
She said: ‘How can I, you see?

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.240
These are dead here.

00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.450
It’s like a cemetery.”

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:43.840
And she was walking carefully because they
must be respected.

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:46.030
You take your children to those churches.

00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:56.000
I mean I don’t know, you don’t understand
that God has talked about spirits in so clear

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
ways.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:02.430
Of course, maybe it’s not so much in the
Bible, maybe, but He showed that He took out

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:08.850
the spirits, He talked of spirits of so many
people, and put them in the pigs and put them

00:55:08.850 --> 00:55:09.880
in the sea.

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:16.490
All this is so clearly given, still, just
see the Christian nations.

00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:28.490
Today’s newspaper, was there one free newspaper,
witchcraft, devils [TEN], devils angels, this

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:37.690
guru, that guru, psychic, ESP, all kinds of
spirits.

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:38.770
Imagine!

00:55:38.770 --> 00:55:42.102
I mean in Indian picture you won’t even
find one advertisement like that.

00:55:42.102 --> 00:55:51.890
Maybe some of the gurus might try, but in
India people know who is real and who is not.

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:54.690
Most of them know.

00:55:54.690 --> 00:56:03.210
While here I find all kinds of things, which
are negative, which have something to do with

00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:04.760
the spirits we are doing.

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:06.600
It is against Christ.

00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:11.700
Why should we bother ourselves about the spirits?

00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:15.010
Let them alone.

00:56:15.010 --> 00:56:18.230
Like somebody’s father is haunting, somebody’s
mother is haunting.

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:20.640
Now, there’ve been so much for you!

00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:21.670
Now forget them.

00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:25.780
Let them be born again to get their Realization.

00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:29.930
Then you call somebody’s spirit here, somebody’s
spirit from dead.

00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:37.130
Some spiritualist goes into a funny gesture
and you start believing that and asking about

00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:38.770
your future and this and that.

00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:43.880
Is all very superfluous and absolutely silly
against your Spirit.

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:49.400
I’ve told you yesterday, those people who
indulge into these, for seven generations

00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:51.320
they suffer, seven generations.

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:56.950
I’m telling you from My experience.

00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:59.710
And those who go to them also suffer.

00:56:59.710 --> 00:57:02.480
Even the countries where this is practiced
too much.

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:09.410
If a child is born there, I know of a lady
whose child was born in a country like that,

00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:13.590
and he had this Agya protruding just like
this.

00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:19.000
And when he saw Me, he started screaming and
shouting, he couldn’t bear Me.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:22.100
And today he’s a different child, I saw.

00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:26.470
He’s a French child, he’s a very different
child.

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:28.310
Absolutely.

00:57:28.310 --> 00:57:32.580
But he was so much and so many spirits in
him, you can’t imagine.

00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:37.810
And she told Me that she, she had a nurse
who was form that country and perhaps she

00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:40.220
has done something to him.

00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:43.810
So the source of this is already unlimited.

00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:46.000
You don’t have to pay for it.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.070
You stand outside and you can get anyone of
them.

00:57:50.070 --> 00:57:52.910
It’s very easy to catch on them, very easy.

00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:55.950
For example, somebody asked Me: “How do
you catch a spirit?”

00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:56.950
I said: “Very simple.

00:57:56.950 --> 00:58:03.840
You put a light before you, of course you
don’t try on that stick, and make a whole

00:58:03.840 --> 00:58:06.300
in a black paper, little hole.

00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:12.340
And through that hole you see the spirit.

00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:17.530
You see that light and you’ll get a spirit
into you.

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:23.820
You get any name, which is commonly used and
go on and chanting that name, you’ll get

00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:26.620
into a spirit.

00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:33.660
You start saying any absurd thing in the presence
of God, in the presence of the picture of

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:39.610
God or of Christ, you insult or do anything
you get into it.

00:58:39.610 --> 00:58:46.700
It is the easiest thing to get a spirit in
you.

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:51.260
You start jumping too much, you get it, you
start saying: “Hooo”.

00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:53.080
You get it.

00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.610
You do any funny thing, you get them.

00:58:55.610 --> 00:58:57.330
They are all around.

00:58:57.330 --> 00:59:02.220
They are busy bodies.

00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:03.880
They want to use you for their purpose.

00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.750
They are very easy available.

00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:09.520
Why do you pay for them?

00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:13.520
Will you pay such a lot of amount just to
get one of them on top of you?

00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:21.430
You
have to be your master, I told you.

00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:29.090
You have to be in the way Christ was.

00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:37.830
It’s only He has the power to raise the
Kundalini of people like that, as you do now.

00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:45.530
He was created in that immaculate way in which
you have been given Realization, in the same

00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:47.850
immaculate manner.

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:48.980
So have your self-esteem.

00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:57.560
You are not going to become slave of these
horrible useless sly aggressive people, who

00:59:57.560 --> 01:00:02.270
are hanging around just to trouble you because
their ambitions are not fulfilled or they

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:09.140
are sly or they are sadists, or they are masochists
and all that kind of thing.

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.750
You are seekers, of high quality.

01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:13.520
Rise up to your Self.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:20.980
This is the message of Christ to you, because
He resurrected Himself.

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:26.880
Did you dance or did you say Hu hu, haa?

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.900
Even He was tempted by Satan.

01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:33.740
And invited the Satan arrive there, and invited.

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:39.060
Nobody asked him to be there.

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:41.710
He has fasted for you, so you don’t fast.

01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:46.370
If you fast, you’ll get a fasting spirit
in you.

01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:51.140
If you overdo your Hatha yoga you’ll get
a spirit, which will do much more Hatha yoga

01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.620
till your ribs break out.

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:53.620
Yeah.

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:56.070
They take you to extremes, you see.

01:00:56.070 --> 01:01:00.560
You see those mad people running, jogging
on the road.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:06.960
They will get it very soon.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:11.140
I am worried about them.

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:13.170
You see, all these extra things, there is
no need to do.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:20.210
Today we saw one of the circus or some sort
of thing that was there, they were three people

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:22.790
from somewhere, I think from Spain and [ALL
THAT].

01:01:22.790 --> 01:01:25.280
And the Vishuddhi was so badly catching in
them.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:28.600
Poor things were putting all the pressure,
going like this, going like that.

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.010
And they said they are statues, whatever it
is.

01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:33.290
I said, I had simple pity for them.

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:35.040
I said: “What are they up to?”

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:38.150
I mean, you can have real statues like that.

01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:44.310
But why make human beings behave so funny,
so extra energy consumers?

01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:45.310
Why?

01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:46.310
Why?

01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:53.380
You are human beings, you are delicate things.

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:56.200
Why do you want to stand on your heads?

01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.800
Why do you want to do something that you are
not supposed to do?

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:10.880
You have to stay in the central path, in a
sensible way, in a very normal way, to get

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:11.890
your Realization.

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:15.600
We’ll not do anything that is extreme.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:16.600
Always avoid extremes.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.800
But you tell something to someone.

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:18.940
Is impossible.

01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:25.810
Human beings must start doing it.

01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:30.520
You give him a cycle, till he breaks his head,
he will not give up his cycle.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:36.420
You give them the skates, till he completely
is in an accident, he won’t give up his

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.420
skates.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:40.490
It’s impossible to deal with them.

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:44.140
To be in the centre is the easiest thing.

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:48.620
Just to be in the center, in the balance.

01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:53.810
Before going to the Sahasrara, I want to tell
you about the balancing, because tomorrow

01:02:53.810 --> 01:02:56.750
I’m going to tell you how the diseases are
caused.

01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:58.130
So the balance is...

01:02:58.130 --> 01:03:06.040
Because if you use anyone of these powers,
for the first power is of superego, through

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:10.870
which we run away from places, we avoid, we
are frightened, we have fears.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:15.880
The another is of aggression, right hand side,
is the ego.

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:19.900
Anyone of them if you use too much, the other
one gets frozen.

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:25.530
For example, a person who thinks too much
and plans too much and thinks that he is responsible

01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:29.920
for the whole world of affairs, you see, and
he is doing all the work, while he doesn’t

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:30.920
do anything, God does everything.

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:38.510
In the myth that he is, develops his ego to
a great extent by which his left side suffers

01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:39.510
too much.

01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:48.690
And then, first thing he develops is all the
problems of the left side in the organ.

01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:53.830
First of all, the poor Swadhishthana cannot
look after the liver so he develops a liver,

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:59.970
then on the left hand side it is absolutely
useless, so he develops diabetes.

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:05.090
Diabetes is not caused by sugar by any chance,
I can tell you.

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:07.690
Of course, you should not take too much sugar,
also.

01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:09.610
I mean, too much of everything is wrong.

01:04:09.610 --> 01:04:10.640
But you must take sugar.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:13.230
Is important for your liver to have your sugar
diet.

01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:18.070
But it’s the idea in the head that if you
take sugar you get diabetes.

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:20.100
Not at all.

01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:26.060
It is caused by over thinking.

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:27.300
Absolutely.

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:28.300
Not by sugar.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:35.810
In an Indian village, a farmer takes at least
every day half a kilo of sugar, for your information.

01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:41.590
And they do not know what diabetes is because
he doesn’t think.

01:04:41.590 --> 01:04:47.220
He just does.

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:54.640
If you want to solve your problem of diabetes,
you have to develop your thoughtless awareness,

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:57.530
which you get when Christ is awakened within
you.

01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:59.180
He thinks for you.

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:02.050
You don’t have to think.

01:05:02.050 --> 01:05:04.940
You just be in that silence, that bliss.

01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:09.660
And then Swadhishthana can look after the
other side.

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:14.000
Diabetes is absolutely curable through Sahaja
Yoga.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:23.670
Then people who suffer from the troubles of
the spleen, like anemia and all those things.

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:25.430
But the worst of all is the blood cancer.

01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:29.970
Blood cancer is the worst thing you suffer
from spleen.

01:05:29.970 --> 01:05:31.820
Now, how it is caused?

01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:38.960
A person who’s very busy, you see, is big
man, he has no time.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:45.060
So he gets out of his bed, puts on his trousers
and he is there for the breakfast, standing

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.170
he’s eating something.

01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:48.580
All right.

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:53.360
Poor this spleen is trying to cooperate that
emergency, is trying to give some blood.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:06:00.530
Suddenly he jumps into his car, he’s driving,
he goes and meets other who are on the way,

01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:04.750
have jammed this way, so he’s cursing them,
doing all kind of things.

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:06.780
He is very speedy, you see.

01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:11.200
He must go and he can’t bear that jam.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:17.600
This speediness comes to you because this
spleen becomes mad.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:18.630
It becomes crazy.

01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:23.280
It doesn’t know how to cope with the man
like that.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:27.220
He has no time to sit down and eat.

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:33.720
Formerly, in India, the husband, of course
our system is rather different, which the

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:38.920
American women won’t like, but we have been
very successful with our methods, you see.

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:45.610
It’s a trick I will tell you.

01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:49.220
The women must know cooking in India.

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:50.760
They might be the richest of rich.

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.420
They must know cooking.

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:54.580
They know very good cooking, excellent.

01:06:54.580 --> 01:07:00.620
You know, you approach your man through his
stomach, always is true.

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:01.630
Hundred percent.

01:07:01.630 --> 01:07:05.510
And then they make the husband sit down comfortably.

01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:10.600
In India, we sit on, I mean we have a kind
of a – what you call a [HINDI WORD], we

01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:15.400
can say a stool which is very low and the
husband sits there and another stool in front

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.400
of him.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:20.000
And she sits there with a fan, you see, she’s
fanning him.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
The rhythm of the food is with the fan.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:28.250
And she serves him and she looks after him,
and she talks to him very sweetly at that

01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:31.130
time when he eats his food.

01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:40.810
That’s the sign of a Gruha Lakshmi, of the,
of the, what is, the Goddess of the family.

01:07:40.810 --> 01:07:44.310
She’s very kind to him, then he likes those
relaxed moments.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:45.310
She feeds him.

01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:50.550
Then he gets up and dresses up and goes to
his work.

01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:57.580
This kind of peace we should give to our husbands,
if you have to control them.

01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:07.500
You have not to compete with them always they
are like children, I tell you.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.880
They are so sweet.

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:16.840
Somebody told Me: “Mother, you must go and
describe your self esteem, Mother of women”.

01:08:16.840 --> 01:08:19.070
I said: “What?”

01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:23.380
“Yes, there are many women who are expecting
their Mother Goddess to come.”

01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:28.960
I said: “But I’m sorry, I’m Mother of
men as well as of women.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:36.130
For Me both of them are just the same, two
chariot’s, the two wheels of a chariot.

01:08:36.130 --> 01:08:38.850
One is on the left, another in the right”.

01:08:38.850 --> 01:08:42.580
Is great thing to be a woman, I must say.

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:47.450
Like this Mother Earth, she bears us because
she’s so powerful.

01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:51.370
If you are a powerful person you can bear
it up.

01:08:51.370 --> 01:08:54.930
For example, husband has to get angry with
you sometimes.

01:08:54.930 --> 01:09:01.929
If he gets angry with somebody in the office,
he loses his job, he’ll be fired.

01:09:01.929 --> 01:09:05.700
But if he sometimes gets angry with you, it’s
all right.

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:06.700
Doesn’t matter.

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:07.700
It’s just fun.

01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:14.920
But a woman has to be that playful, that cheerful
and that understanding should be in a woman.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.400
What is there to compete with them?

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:21.140
You are the power, the potential.

01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:24.120
You have to give that power of love to your
husbands.

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:28.950
In Sahaja yoga we have changed the entire
system of society, also.

01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:34.830
It’s such a beautiful relationship between
husband and wife, such a beautiful one among

01:09:34.830 --> 01:09:35.960
children and parents and....

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:38.390
It’s so beautiful, you can’t imagine.

01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:42.509
That age has to come.

01:09:42.509 --> 01:09:45.830
We are not to fight for any rights, we have
every rights.

01:09:45.830 --> 01:09:48.660
A woman has every right within herself.

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:50.440
She doesn’t know how to handle it.

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:51.620
And they have gone crazy.

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:55.090
They don’t know what to do with these men.

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:58.290
It’s very easy to handle them.

01:09:58.290 --> 01:10:04.640
You have to learn the art of expressing your
love.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.840
That’s the thing we lack.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:13.570
We should come from your heart to understand
that we can’t live without each other.

01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:18.350
This will stop many things that are going
wrong in this country and the injustice we

01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:23.420
are doing to the children who are born to
us.

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:30.020
Now this is I am saying because Christ has
blessed marriage.

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:34.420
Those who believe in nunneries and all that
are really nonsensical.

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:37.470
And the nuns getting married to this innocence?

01:10:37.470 --> 01:10:41.780
I mean, how can innocence marry?

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:45.670
This is the worst thing you can do to Christ
is to say that: “This nun is married to

01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:46.670
Christ”.

01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:49.440
I just can’t bear the idea.

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:53.680
Is absurd, is an insult of innocence.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:59.000
And this is what it is, we should understand,
that marriage is blessed by Him.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Is a sacred thing.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.340
We should not make a mess out of it.

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:08.470
Is so pure.

01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:10.610
Is very beautiful.

01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:18.370
You enjoy each other in company, also in separation
you do enjoy.

01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:23.640
If you know how to be sweet to each other,
is so beautiful.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.540
It’s very beautiful.

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:28.850
These traditions will come back as soon as
you become the Spirit.

01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:30.530
I’m sure of it.

01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:40.320
Now, so we come, I told you about the imbalances
to a great extend, but later on tomorrow also

01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:44.440
I‘m going to tell you because Sahaja Yogis
have to look after their imbalances to keep

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:50.060
their health all right and to look after the
health of other people also.

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:56.460
Now about the tenth chakra, the last chakra
as called the seventh chakra, seventh chakra,

01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:59.230
which is very important.

01:11:59.230 --> 01:12:06.920
This chakra has got all these seven centers
in it.

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:12.170
It is placed in the brain.

01:12:12.170 --> 01:12:18.060
The brain, if you have a transverse section
of that, you can see it looks like a lotus

01:12:18.060 --> 01:12:19.060
leaves.

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:29.400
It is said there are one thousand nerves,
or one thousand centers or plexuses for this

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:33.580
particular center called as Sahasrara.

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:37.020
Sahasrara means one thousand petals.

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:38.840
And these petals are shown there.

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:45.941
Of course they are not one thousand there,
but they look like living flames of different

01:12:45.941 --> 01:12:46.941
colors.

01:12:46.941 --> 01:12:50.250
“I will appear before you like tongues of
flames.”

01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:51.250
It’s said.

01:12:51.250 --> 01:12:58.720
Even the other centers look like tongues of
flames, you see, the flames were enlighten.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.040
But the living flames are very silent.

01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:09.380
They are placed as a lotus and as the Kundalini
comes up She pushes this lotus out and you

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:20.110
touch the seat of the Spirit, which is on
top of your head and you enter into the super

01:13:20.110 --> 01:13:21.820
consciousness.

01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:26.940
Not into the collective subconscious or not
into the collective supraconscious, but into

01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:31.870
the super consciousness, where you become
the master, you become the Spirit.

01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:36.570
And you start feeling the All Pervading Power
around you.

01:13:36.570 --> 01:13:43.750
And through your fontanel bone area you feel
the cool breeze, you actually feel it.

01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:46.610
It’s an actualization.

01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:55.910
It is not just that I baptized you, you are
being baptized, it is not possible.

01:13:55.910 --> 01:14:02.300
On the contrary, I’ve seen some people who
touch the fontanel bone area of the children

01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.280
introduce spirits.

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.720
Yes.

01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:14.540
It should be done only by a Realized soul
and not by every Dick, Tom and Harry.

01:14:14.540 --> 01:14:17.130
Is a very dangerous thing.

01:14:17.130 --> 01:14:24.190
Now, this Sahasrara has got all the seven
centers, the seats of all the seven centers

01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:25.240
are there.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:29.450
Start from here is the Agya chakra.

01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:32.190
Here is the Vishuddhi.

01:14:32.190 --> 01:14:35.430
Then here is the Heart.

01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:38.580
Now see, it’s so simple.

01:14:38.580 --> 01:14:39.580
Heart.

01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:46.780
If it is not heart felt, if you have not felt
it from your heart...

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:49.320
Because some people come from other gurus,
I’ve seen them.

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:54.680
They sit here just to mock and laugh at it
and make fun of it.

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:57.810
They never get Realization.

01:14:57.810 --> 01:15:01.900
If your heart is caught up with your ego,
also is difficult.

01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:09.960
If your heart is weak, maybe any problem with
the heart, it can be anything, I mean, so

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:13.010
the Realization here stops.

01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:18.400
Heart has to be strong, you have to have a
heart felt desire.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:21.950
That’s the center here of the heart.

01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:29.990
So I told you this is the center here of the
Agya chakra, Vishuddhi chakra.

01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:35.280
This is the center is the, is the, we can
say, a [SATELLITE, SUBTLE OF IT], of the Agya

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:40.540
chakra between the two, because here these
two also come out a little bit, the Ha Tha,

01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:43.710
both of them come out here, down below.

01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:45.110
It’s Hamsa.

01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:53.670
But main chakra is this Agya and then there
is the center of Vishuddhi, then here is the

01:15:53.670 --> 01:15:54.900
center of Heart.

01:15:54.900 --> 01:16:03.210
Now, behind here, is the center of Mooladhara,
here, just in the center.

01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:09.250
For example today I met a lady who told Me
she’s loosing her eyesight.

01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.580
It could be due to two things only.

01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:21.600
It could be due to diabetes or it could be
due to some possession you can lose you eyesight.

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:24.920
Now, if it is in the center, it is a possession.

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:30.570
But diabetes is caused by the Swadhishthana
chakra around it.

01:16:30.570 --> 01:16:39.190
So even if it is due to diabetes it can constrict
the optic globe by which you can have problem

01:16:39.190 --> 01:16:40.190
on your eyesight.

01:16:40.190 --> 01:16:43.490
Your eyes will be open, but suddenly you can’t
see anything.

01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:46.150
This is absolutely curable, absolutely curable.

01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:50.820
Spirits, they get to it.

01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:56.430
How much we have to be careful about spirits
that you will realize very soon, as soon as

01:16:56.430 --> 01:16:58.980
you will take to Sahaja yoga.

01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:12.270
So the center here of the Agya is caught up
and when it is caught up it just makes the

01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:16.640
optic globe ineffective and you can’t see.

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:20.560
Your eyes are open, you can’t see.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:26.460
And when this diabetes is setting this center
around which is the Swadhishthana chakra,

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:28.130
gets affected.

01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:33.140
Vishuddhi chakra is here, is here.

01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:35.630
I mean Nabhi chakra, is here.

01:17:35.630 --> 01:17:40.510
This is Nabhi chakra, which has got left and
right.

01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:50.780
So all these centers are in
the brain, so the essence of Sahasrara is

01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:58.690
integration, unity, complete integration.

01:17:58.690 --> 01:18:01.620
You cannot integrate nonsensical things together.

01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:14.450
Integration is only possible of the people
who are of the same style, or of the Deities

01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:18.579
who stand for God.

01:18:18.579 --> 01:18:25.440
You cannot have satanic people and Godly people
integrated, can you?

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:26.880
You cannot unite these people.

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:29.380
You try it and you’ll have problem.

01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:33.570
That’s the best way you see the destruction
of every unity.

01:18:33.570 --> 01:18:41.770
So in Sanskrit is a very good, good word got
for integration, Samagra, beautiful word which

01:18:41.770 --> 01:18:56.680
means, Agra is the, Agra is the hole in the
needle, and when a thread passes through this

01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:02.370
needles, it passes through the Agra, so it
is Samagra.

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:08.090
And this integration has to take place as
soon as you cross over.

01:19:08.090 --> 01:19:16.460
And because of this you get your Realization
and you feel all the chakras are enlightened.

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:24.770
Unless and until you pass through this fontanel
area you cannot feel the All Pervading Power.

01:19:24.770 --> 01:19:31.220
With awakening only, with the awakening of
the Kundalini, you can give Realization even

01:19:31.220 --> 01:19:34.910
to people, you may think, but it won’t stay
there.

01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:38.940
But, of course, you can cure people, all right.

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:46.230
But with Realization, if you establish yourself,
which I’ll tell you how to do it tomorrow,

01:19:46.230 --> 01:19:55.290
then you can give Realizations to others,
you can manifest all your powers, even you

01:19:55.290 --> 01:19:58.510
can control the element, for your information.

01:19:58.510 --> 01:20:00.380
Yes, after some time.

01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:02.490
We have some people in India.

01:20:02.490 --> 01:20:09.130
There’s an ordinary fisherman, again a fisherman,
he is educated, he’s a graduated, but he’s

01:20:09.130 --> 01:20:10.210
a fisherman.

01:20:10.210 --> 01:20:12.270
His name is Harish Chandra.

01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:13.770
He’s a Realized soul.

01:20:13.770 --> 01:20:15.790
He got his Realization.

01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:20.270
He said: “Mother, I never knew you have
given me so many powers.”

01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:21.320
I said: “Really?

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:22.320
What happened?”

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:34.750
He said: “I was going to a village across
to another island and the whole area was covered

01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:39.780
with clouds in such a way that a tempest was
expected, absolutely, horrible.

01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:41.880
And people said: ’Don’t go out’”.

01:20:41.880 --> 01:20:49.190
He said: “I was so much frustrated, I just
stood up there and I said: ‘Now see, I’m

01:20:49.190 --> 01:20:50.600
going for God’s work.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:54.130
And will you, please, behave yourself till
I come back?’”.

01:20:54.130 --> 01:20:56.600
And he said: “The clouds were removed.

01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:02.340
Went there and came back, when I reached my
home in the night, that time it started raining”

01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:05.400
and there were 25 people other fishermen with
him.

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:14.270
In India the work is taking up a big form,
among the villagers, among the people who

01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:17.060
are simple.

01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:18.500
You do not lack behind.

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:25.350
Though they are simple people, they are good
people.

01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:34.380
You are the leaders, you are great saints,
you have been seeking for ages and now the

01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:37.510
time has come for you to get it.

01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:39.670
So do not miss it.

01:21:39.670 --> 01:21:44.420
For anybody’s sake, do not plead for any
gurus or anyone.

01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:46.260
You just plead for yourself.

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:50.080
You have paid them, finish it off.

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:51.720
Done your duty.

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.900
It was a mistake.

01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:55.000
Forget it.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.970
Get your Realization.

01:21:56.970 --> 01:22:00.480
Get to your Spirit.

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:12.120
The Sahasrara is opened out, is opened out
because of this Sahaja yoga has become a mass

01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:13.630
movement now.

01:22:13.630 --> 01:22:16.650
Thousands can get Realization.

01:22:16.650 --> 01:22:17.650
Thousands.

01:22:17.650 --> 01:22:21.460
They have been thousand people, six thousand
people, as he says this, that’s true.

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:22.460
It is true.

01:22:22.460 --> 01:22:23.460
It is true.

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:25.140
It has happened.

01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:27.360
It’s so miraculous.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:30.340
But you are miraculous you are great.

01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:34.000
Just to find out yourself, what a great instrument
you are.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:39.420
You’ll be amazed what things you can do.

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:45.120
I can write a chapter like a book on Sahasrara,
because that’s My place.

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:47.360
I know it so well.

01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:58.520
But today I think that is sufficient and later
on I hope you might be able to get the books

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:05.560
on this, maybe tomorrow, and then you might
be able to read about it.

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:09.790
But first get your Realization, because without
Realization if you read you’ll again become

01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:13.150
a scholar good for nothing.

01:23:13.150 --> 01:23:18.170
That’s why we don’t sell our books to
people who are not realized.

01:23:18.170 --> 01:23:23.830
We just don’t, because they become scholars,
you see.

01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:25.590
They start writing another book.

01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:28.230
I mean people are so funny.

01:23:28.230 --> 01:23:29.550
What’s the use?

01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:39.470
Christ has said: “Now, if you want gold,
all right, have it, but be zealous.

01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:44.850
I eat with those who enter into the Kingdom
of God”.

01:23:44.850 --> 01:23:52.540
Take to the Kingdom of God and do not worry
about your intellectual feeds.

01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:53.540
You’ve had enough of it.

01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:54.540
Take to it.

01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:55.540
May God bless you all.

01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:59.010
Now today, if you have some questions, you
may ask but I think we should go in [UNCLEAR]

01:23:59.010 --> 01:24:15.090
experience, but if you have questions and
if you are not representing any guru, then

01:24:15.090 --> 01:24:16.290
please ask.

01:24:16.290 --> 01:24:22.330
I don’t want to talking, answering [IN CONTROVERSY,
QUESTIONS ABOUT]….

01:24:22.330 --> 01:24:30.460
I’ve already told you about them and I do
not want to hear anything about these horrible

01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:31.460
people.

01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:36.880
You know, yesterday somebody argued about
Yogananda.

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:41.580
And this lady [UNCLEAR]: “O God, it’s
feeling hot.

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:43.420
The certificate is there.”

01:24:43.420 --> 01:24:49.390
All right, if you have to ask questions, do
not be aggressive and just get your Realization.

01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:52.620
That’s the main thing you should have.

01:24:52.620 --> 01:25:00.290
Question: I’d like to know if Mother is
a vegetarian.

01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:07.430
Shri Mataji: No, not at all.

01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:16.220
So, supposing I was Kali once upon a time,
I had to drink the blood of these horrible

01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:17.220
devils.

01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:20.810
How could I be a vegetarian?

01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:24.970
Krishna was not a vegetarian, Rama was not
a vegetarian.

01:25:24.970 --> 01:25:30.930
Don’t become vegetarians, I cannot save
chickens and I cannot give them Realization.

01:25:30.930 --> 01:25:34.420
That doesn’t mean that you all the time
eat meat, meat, meat.

01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:36.550
Also doesn’t mean all the time think of
food.

01:25:36.550 --> 01:25:38.530
You see, I’m not bothered what I eat.

01:25:38.530 --> 01:25:42.460
If you ask Me what I ate in the morning, I
don’t know.

01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:46.080
There’s no fuss about food.

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.420
I’m not a vegetarian.

01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:50.240
How could I be?

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:57.750
Hindu Indians know that, that Mother can’t
be a vegetarian.

01:25:57.750 --> 01:26:03.340
Krishna could not be because He had to kill
so many people.

01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:04.340
And you should not be.

01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:08.220
By becoming vegetarian you won’t reach to
God, I can tell you.

01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:15.560
On the contrary, you catch on the left Nabhi
if you become these horrible vegetarians like

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.510
the Jains we have in India.

01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:20.130
Jains, have you heard about them, Jains?

01:26:20.130 --> 01:26:30.540
They try to save even the mosquitoes and
the bugs.

01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:34.970
Now, I can’t do, I can’t do anything about
mosquitoes and bugs.

01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:41.620
[I MEAN IT HAS GONE, AND WE CAN GO] to that
absurd, you [KNOW, SAW]?

01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:49.590
Those who talked about it, you read in the
book, where Buddha and Mahavira, they couldn’t

01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:52.500
bear the way people were stupid.

01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:57.941
So they were born again as Hassan and Hussein,
the grandchildren of Mohammad Saab and they

01:26:57.941 --> 01:27:29.090
fought in Karbala to show that when it comes
to fighting you have

01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:30.090
to fight.

01:27:30.090 --> 01:27:33.700
So, onward Christian soldiers.

01:27:33.700 --> 01:28:49.500
Question: Mother [UNCLEAR] when you give somebody

01:28:49.500 --> 01:30:25.730
a blessing, or when You say: “I am [UNCLEAR],
I am [LOVE, NARADA], what do you come to [UNCLEAR]

01:30:25.730 --> 01:30:27.500
on you.

01:30:27.500 --> 01:31:00.730
Shri Mataji: I don’t say that, did I?

01:31:00.730 --> 01:57:05.960
[MISSING FROM RECORDED SPEECH]
