WEBVTT

01:16.040 --> 01:19.480
I thank all the Sahaja Yogis

01:19.840 --> 01:25.680
from Derbyshire and Birmingham

01:25.920 --> 01:31.120
for giving Me this opportunity to talk to the seekers of this place.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.880
We have seekers in the modern times,

01:41.080 --> 01:43.400
is something very unique.

01:43.600 --> 01:46.680
We never had seekers before,

01:47.040 --> 01:49.760
at least not so many.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.400
There used to be people

01:52.720 --> 01:58.560
who would seek money, as there are many who are seeking these days,

01:59.000 --> 02:05.160
who would seek countries after countries, the power.

02:05.840 --> 02:11.440
There were (not) many who were seeking these

02:12.880 --> 02:20.800
few pearls of bliss of God, very few.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.720
The reason was the awareness,

02:26.080 --> 02:29.480
the collective awareness of human beings

02:30.040 --> 02:33.960
did not think themselves perhaps capable

02:34.480 --> 02:40.880
or perhaps needing some seeking.

02:41.640 --> 02:46.720
But today it's such a beautiful combination

02:47.120 --> 02:52.720
that there are seekers of very high quality born on this earth.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.800
Those who are seeking are in masses.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.480
They are not one or two here and there

02:59.760 --> 03:02.480
sitting on top of a mountain,

03:02.760 --> 03:07.240
cave or something and trying to meditate,

03:07.440 --> 03:10.640
but there are so many who are seeking,

03:11.000 --> 03:17.040
who feel dissatisfied with themselves, with whatever they have.

03:17.360 --> 03:21.320
They think there must be something beyond.

03:21.800 --> 03:28.440
Those who feel that they have not yet found their meaning,

03:28.640 --> 03:33.200
those who feel they have to find the purpose of their life,

03:33.520 --> 03:35.280
those who feel

03:35.480 --> 03:37.960
that there has to be something higher

03:38.160 --> 03:41.680
than what they are into,

03:41.880 --> 03:49.840
all such people are seekers, not of today but of thousands of years.

03:53.400 --> 03:57.360
At the time of Christ there were none, I should say,

03:57.560 --> 04:02.640
because even the ones Christ took as His disciples,

04:02.840 --> 04:04.840
they were actually forced into it;

04:05.080 --> 04:07.840
and He had to go and seek them and find them out

04:08.080 --> 04:10.960
and tell them about it.

04:12.520 --> 04:18.360
So we have to say that these are very important times

04:18.560 --> 04:20.720
in the history of creation,

04:20.920 --> 04:23.200
where there are so many seekers.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.080
But the problem with the seekers today is this

04:26.320 --> 04:28.920
that they don't know what they are seeking.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.240
They have no idea as to what to seek,

04:32.520 --> 04:36.600
how to seek, what to expect.

04:36.880 --> 04:39.320
It's an unknown area they are entering into.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.040
It's very unknown to them.

04:42.840 --> 04:46.760
And this unknown area which they are seeking

04:47.320 --> 04:50.600
is now represented by so many people.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.400
Everyone says, "I'm the one who will deliver the goods."

04:53.600 --> 04:56.120
Another one says, "I'm the one who can do it."

04:56.320 --> 05:01.520
Naturally confusion is created,

05:01.760 --> 05:07.400
as it is, modern times are the times of confusion, great confusion.

05:07.680 --> 05:13.000
And when there such a confusion comes in, then only we find out

05:13.760 --> 05:17.200
a great solution also, a permanent solution

05:17.480 --> 05:19.840
to solve the problem once for all.

05:20.040 --> 05:23.520
There has been never such confusion in the minds of human beings

05:23.720 --> 05:28.120
as it is today as to the right or wrong. Never so much.

05:28.320 --> 05:31.880
Whatever was said, "This was not good," they would do,

05:32.360 --> 05:34.400
knowingly that they are doing wrong.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.280
If they were good people, they would say,

05:36.480 --> 05:38.440
"All right, this is good, we'll do the good."

05:38.720 --> 05:44.560
But everybody knew that this was wrong or right. They may do it.

05:44.920 --> 05:49.080
But today no one knows what is wrong and what is right.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.480
Apart from wrong and right, it's much beyond that,

05:52.680 --> 05:54.640
you have to know yourself.

05:54.840 --> 05:58.840
Because this awareness is within us that we do not know ourselves,

05:59.120 --> 06:02.120
we do not know the absolute. We live in a relative world.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.840
Of this everybody seems to be conscious,

06:05.040 --> 06:09.240
maybe in the subconscious or maybe in the unconscious,

06:09.680 --> 06:13.360
but definitely there's a feeling in every one of us

06:13.560 --> 06:15.960
that "We do not know."

06:16.200 --> 06:18.720
And it's a very honest feeling,

06:18.920 --> 06:21.240
it's a very sublime feeling

06:21.440 --> 06:24.000
that we have to know something more.

06:24.240 --> 06:28.680
Now when we say the word "know," we think as if I would say,

06:28.880 --> 06:32.280
"I don't know about Derbyshire, I have never been there."

06:32.600 --> 06:33.880
Now this means what?

06:34.080 --> 06:36.840
I don't know about Derbyshire.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.920
What don't I know about Derbyshire?

06:39.120 --> 06:41.680
I can read it in the books, I can find out.

06:41.880 --> 06:44.560
I can know all the history of Derbyshire.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.960
I can find out who were the people who,

06:47.160 --> 06:49.080
who were making beautiful porcelain here,

06:49.280 --> 06:50.920
I can find out all about their history,

06:51.120 --> 06:52.520
everything I can read about it.

06:52.760 --> 06:56.080
Still, why should I say I don't know anything about Derbyshire?

06:56.360 --> 06:58.880
Because I have not been to Derbyshire before.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.960
I have not been to Derby, I have not been to this area,

07:02.280 --> 07:04.920
I have not seen this place, I have not visited it,

07:05.120 --> 07:09.360
I have had no experience of this place, so I don't know about it.

07:09.560 --> 07:12.280
This is exactly what is the situation.

07:12.480 --> 07:16.280
The situation is that we do not know about the Divine.

07:16.480 --> 07:19.480
We have read about it, we have heard about it.

07:19.720 --> 07:21.440
So many people have written about it.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.080
Once they know there's an enquiry about it,

07:24.280 --> 07:26.600
they come out with books. Books after books,

07:26.800 --> 07:28.880
thousands of books they have written.

07:29.160 --> 07:32.200
How many of them are true and how many of them are untrue?

07:32.480 --> 07:35.360
It is impossible to find out,

07:35.560 --> 07:38.120
because we do not actually know.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.880
Supposing somebody says

07:40.080 --> 07:43.560
that Duke of Bedford was born in Derbyshire.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.880
Alright, how will I know?

07:46.080 --> 07:47.840
I would not know till I meet somebody

07:48.040 --> 07:52.280
who is really belonging to that place, who knows about it.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.920
In the same way, the knowledge that we have

07:55.120 --> 07:58.920
also about Divine is very confusing.

07:59.120 --> 08:03.200
But this is not knowledge, this is never the knowledge.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.440
The idea of knowledge comes to us

08:06.640 --> 08:14.280
as if it is a kind of an answer to our enquiries

08:14.480 --> 08:17.520
which is rational, which we can understand intelligently

08:17.720 --> 08:19.560
through our intelligence.

08:19.760 --> 08:24.760
But now this area is beyond intelligence, beyond rationality,

08:25.040 --> 08:30.560
beyond all that is limited - is the unlimited area.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.840
All such unlimited areas can be only known

08:34.040 --> 08:38.720
by experience of your awareness.

08:38.920 --> 08:42.200
Now this one should understand is a very delicate thing,

08:42.400 --> 08:46.960
how to know something, an experience of our awareness.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.240
Not an experience, they suddenly see a light, so it's an experience.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.200
I mean, you can always see a light!

08:52.560 --> 08:56.920
So great the people feel about it that they have seen some light

08:57.160 --> 08:59.400
suddenly sparking before them. Nothing so great.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.680
There could be some area from there a sparking can come,

09:02.880 --> 09:06.280
and maybe it is of no use to you,

09:06.480 --> 09:08.960
but just you might feel that you have experienced.

09:09.200 --> 09:13.160
So one must know that seeing is not experiencing.

09:13.360 --> 09:17.600
For example, a dog sees this instrument,

09:18.440 --> 09:23.080
but what does he know about it? He sees it.

09:25.760 --> 09:29.080
Awareness, the human awareness

09:29.320 --> 09:32.080
has so many great things about itself,

09:32.280 --> 09:35.960
compared to the animal awareness.

09:36.400 --> 09:41.760
For example, we can say the awareness of beauty - animals don't have,

09:41.960 --> 09:46.880
awareness of cleanliness - animals don't have.

09:47.360 --> 09:51.320
Human beings have these

09:51.720 --> 09:54.480
built within themselves, they can feel it.

09:54.720 --> 09:58.800
They can feel it on their central nervous system.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.920
So whatever is your awareness,

10:01.120 --> 10:03.840
is to be felt on your central nervous system.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.120
It's not just an imaginary thing

10:06.320 --> 10:08.520
or an intellectual discussion,

10:08.720 --> 10:11.320
"Ah, yes, yes, I know, I know" - not that way.

10:11.520 --> 10:17.400
The knowledge should come to you through your feelings,

10:17.960 --> 10:20.640
like I can feel this is hot or cold,

10:20.840 --> 10:24.400
but a stone will not feel anything.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.680
In the same way, the feeling has to come

10:26.920 --> 10:28.360
through your central nervous system.

10:28.560 --> 10:33.480
That means your awareness itself is to be going, has to be charged.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.760
It has to get a new dimension;

10:35.960 --> 10:39.320
your awareness itself has to get a new dimension.

10:39.520 --> 10:40.880
All other experiences

10:41.080 --> 10:44.240
have no meaning whatsoever in evolution, if you see.

10:45.280 --> 10:49.320
In evolutionary process it is the awareness that improves,

10:49.560 --> 10:53.360
receives better and better dimensions.

10:53.680 --> 10:56.240
And these dimensions have reached its maximum

10:56.480 --> 10:58.840
at the time when you become a human being,

10:59.040 --> 11:03.880
where your awareness is just ready to receive

11:04.240 --> 11:09.720
the awareness of the Universal Being, of the Collective Being,

11:09.920 --> 11:12.720
so that you become the collective being.

11:12.960 --> 11:16.080
Now I would like to tell you about this within ourselves,

11:16.280 --> 11:17.760
how we are placed.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.720
For every practical purposes

11:21.000 --> 11:24.400
you should not take Me for granted,

11:24.640 --> 11:27.480
but you should not also deny what I tell you.

11:27.680 --> 11:31.880
It's like entering into a new university:

11:32.160 --> 11:36.840
We listen to the professor and we try to follow him.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.520
Supposing he propounded,

11:39.720 --> 11:44.960
he propounds a hypothesis before you,

11:45.280 --> 11:50.600
then you just start judging it, work it out.

11:50.800 --> 11:58.040
If it is true, then you call it a law.

11:58.360 --> 12:04.680
In the same way, we should enter into this new understanding

12:04.880 --> 12:08.440
by first seeing it, not denying it.

12:08.640 --> 12:12.120
then if it is true, then we have to believe it.

12:12.360 --> 12:15.240
There should be no blind faith about Sahaja Yoga.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.880
Blind faith does not help at all.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.960
Neither there should be a denial.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.320
And with that cheerful attitude

12:23.520 --> 12:26.960
if you just listen to Me as a hypothesis whatever I'm telling you,

12:27.160 --> 12:29.880
you need not accept it as truth just now.

12:30.080 --> 12:34.080
But then the time has come for Me to prove the truth to you!

12:34.280 --> 12:37.360
And the truth can be proved to you.

12:37.560 --> 12:40.640
Time has come to prove the existence of God;

12:40.840 --> 12:45.880
to prove, not prove that I give you a big lecture

12:46.080 --> 12:48.560
or take you to courts or some sort of a thing like that,

12:48.800 --> 12:53.720
but how am I going to prove it? On your awareness.

12:54.160 --> 13:01.480
It is going to be absolute experience of your awareness

13:01.720 --> 13:07.800
that you are going to feel God Almighty!

13:08.080 --> 13:14.640
Time has come to prove the scriptures, all the scriptures.

13:14.880 --> 13:20.840
The time has come to prove your own connection with God,

13:21.040 --> 13:23.320
your own relationship with Him,

13:23.520 --> 13:26.840
your own relationship with that Primordial Being,

13:27.040 --> 13:28.920
whether you call it "God" or anything,

13:29.120 --> 13:31.640
it makes no difference to God Himself.

13:31.840 --> 13:34.800
Whether you call Him by any name, there is God,

13:35.000 --> 13:38.280
and that God is not the way you conceive God,

13:38.480 --> 13:41.920
it's not the way you understand God or you know God,

13:42.200 --> 13:45.240
but is the God as He is.

13:45.480 --> 13:50.880
Unless and until you yourself feel Him,

13:51.120 --> 13:52.960
you are not going to believe in Him.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.880
Even if you believe under certain circumstances,

13:56.080 --> 13:58.040
it's a belief that is blind.

13:58.240 --> 14:01.640
It has no meaning for any intelligent person,

14:01.840 --> 14:03.600
and the day will come that such a person

14:03.800 --> 14:07.200
is going to denounce that kind of a blind faith.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.680
So now within ourselves, as I said,

14:09.880 --> 14:13.680
is a built-in system which has come to us

14:13.880 --> 14:17.920
through our ascent in our awareness at different stages,

14:18.120 --> 14:20.640
which is like a history written within ourselves

14:20.840 --> 14:23.160
how we become human beings.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.880
Into different stages we were divided.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.240
First of all the stage of the carbon,

14:29.480 --> 14:33.480
where we became alive,

14:33.680 --> 14:36.880
the dead became the life.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.240
That is placed at that point.

14:39.440 --> 14:43.080
It is below that great power within us

14:43.280 --> 14:47.600
which lies in the triangular bone, which we call as Kundalini.

14:47.800 --> 14:54.280
This power is the power also described in the Bible

14:54.560 --> 14:56.400
as the 'Tree of Life',

14:56.600 --> 14:58.960
'I'll appear before you like tongues of flames',

14:59.160 --> 15:02.080
but Bible being a very microscopic thing,

15:02.360 --> 15:05.960
it cannot be explained, the symbolism of that,

15:06.200 --> 15:10.040
unless and until you get your new awareness

15:10.240 --> 15:14.160
or the vibratory awareness, it cannot be explained.

15:14.360 --> 15:18.400
Now this power is the power of desire,

15:18.640 --> 15:22.560
of the ultimate desire, the only desire, the real desire

15:22.800 --> 15:24.800
that we have within ourselves.

15:25.040 --> 15:29.720
All other desires become useless.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.960
See in the affluent countries now

15:32.200 --> 15:36.760
people have achieved affluence; they are rich, well-to-do;

15:37.200 --> 15:39.960
but they are not happy.

15:40.280 --> 15:44.720
People who are extremely affluent like in Sweden

15:44.960 --> 15:49.600
and in Switzerland, they're competing among themselves,

15:49.840 --> 15:54.080
how many youths are going to commit suicide!

15:54.280 --> 16:00.120
Recently I learnt that Swiss people are "better off"-

16:00.320 --> 16:03.280
many more Swiss people are committing suicide

16:03.520 --> 16:09.600
than the people who were young people in Sweden.

16:09.800 --> 16:14.520
This is the state where we should realise that affluence,

16:14.720 --> 16:18.560
if it was our desire, is not the real desire;

16:18.760 --> 16:20.840
because when we got the affluence

16:21.040 --> 16:23.680
we should have been very happy and joyous people.

16:23.880 --> 16:25.560
But we are not.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.680
And the basics of economics is that

16:28.880 --> 16:30.960
wants in particular may be satiable,

16:31.240 --> 16:33.840
but in general they are never satiable,

16:34.040 --> 16:38.360
means, matter cannot satisfy your wants.

16:38.560 --> 16:42.600
So what is the want, what is the seeking one has?

16:42.800 --> 16:46.280
Is hidden in this power,

16:46.520 --> 16:50.760
and that is the seeking to become one with God,

16:50.960 --> 16:53.840
the yoga, the union with God,

16:54.120 --> 16:57.160
what we call the baptism.

16:57.440 --> 17:02.240
In the Koran it's called as the pir.

17:02.440 --> 17:05.800
You have to become the pir, the "twice born."

17:06.080 --> 17:08.920
It is described in various languages,

17:09.120 --> 17:11.960
but the same thing that they have described

17:12.160 --> 17:14.640
is the same in every scripture.

17:14.840 --> 17:19.240
If you try to follow what it means,

17:19.440 --> 17:23.800
you'll be amazed that they all said the same things.

17:24.200 --> 17:27.080
Now somebody might say, 'There might be some other methods, Mother,

17:27.280 --> 17:29.160
it can be something else that can work it out.'

17:29.400 --> 17:31.040
There's no other method,

17:31.240 --> 17:35.480
because this has been worked out for thousands and thousands of years

17:35.680 --> 17:38.160
within yourselves since you became carbon.

17:38.360 --> 17:41.720
And it's all arranged within you by nature.

17:42.040 --> 17:46.760
Like somebody can say that a seed has to sprout

17:47.040 --> 17:50.600
by some other method - there is no other method for a seed.

17:50.880 --> 17:54.520
The seed has got a primule and the primule has to be awakened,

17:54.720 --> 17:56.960
is the only way it works out.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.920
In the same way it is going to work out in all of you.

18:01.120 --> 18:04.760
This power is to be shaken within you,

18:04.960 --> 18:07.840
it is to be awakened within you.

18:08.040 --> 18:11.960
If it is awakened within you, it rises.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.360
But what is this power?

18:14.560 --> 18:18.320
This power is to become one with the Spirit.

18:18.520 --> 18:22.120
So this power knows that it has to become

18:22.320 --> 18:27.800
one with the Divine.

18:28.120 --> 18:31.600
Now we have so many other desires,

18:31.800 --> 18:34.480
so we should say, how is it related to that?

18:34.680 --> 18:37.720
It's like this, that we have to say,

18:37.920 --> 18:42.360
'Come to Derbyshire and meet you all, people.'

18:42.560 --> 18:46.560
Now we come all the way, we come up to Guildhall,

18:46.760 --> 18:50.440
come up here, and don't meet you.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.240
Then all My coming,

18:52.440 --> 18:56.720
all My travelling is useless because I've not met you.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.720
It has no meaning whatsoever.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.120
In the same way all other desires

19:01.320 --> 19:07.840
are just to accomplish this desire, the ultimate desire,

19:08.120 --> 19:13.280
the desire to become one with the Divine.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.000
Lots of things can be said about Kundalini.

19:16.200 --> 19:20.480
I must have spoken hundreds of times about Kundalini,

19:20.800 --> 19:23.240
and to know more about it

19:23.440 --> 19:27.440
you will have to get to Sahaja Yoga and know more about it.

19:27.680 --> 19:31.320
But just now I have told you in brief what is this Kundalini,

19:31.560 --> 19:33.760
and how it is placed there.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.880
Now the, above that is the second -

19:37.080 --> 19:40.760
actually the second one we treat as the third one, it looks here -

19:40.960 --> 19:43.600
is the power of,

19:43.800 --> 19:51.480
I would say,  (inaudible) this is the centre of our seeking.

19:52.600 --> 19:55.800
This centre is called as the Nabhi Chakra,

19:56.000 --> 19:58.400
which gives us our seeking.

19:58.600 --> 20:02.960
When we are in the state of animal,

20:03.200 --> 20:08.200
then we seek food through our stomach.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.960
And you will be amazed then when we become human beings

20:11.160 --> 20:16.680
also we seek our money through our stomach.

20:16.880 --> 20:20.280
We may get little diverted here and there,

20:20.480 --> 20:26.840
but ultimately we even seek our God through our stomach.

20:27.080 --> 20:33.960
Surrounding this stomach is the area where one has to cross.

20:34.200 --> 20:40.880
And this area is actually the area of the Masters.

20:41.160 --> 20:45.440
All the Primordial Masters were born in this area,

20:45.680 --> 20:48.560
like Moses, Socrates.

20:48.800 --> 20:52.840
There are main basic ten primordial beings,

20:53.040 --> 20:54.720
who came on this earth,

20:54.920 --> 21:01.760
who came to give us an idea as to our seeking, what we have to do.

21:01.960 --> 21:07.400
Basically they came here to teach us how to balance ourselves,

21:07.640 --> 21:10.200
how to balance, so we can ascend.

21:10.440 --> 21:17.000
Now all these great prophets or primordial beings,

21:17.280 --> 21:20.680
we should say they were the ones who were the masters,

21:21.040 --> 21:25.280
they came to inform us

21:25.480 --> 21:29.240
that if you cross too much onto the left side

21:29.440 --> 21:32.360
or too much on the right side,

21:32.600 --> 21:36.360
then you will be falling in your sustenance,

21:36.560 --> 21:41.360
in your quality as a human being.

21:41.560 --> 21:45.280
As a human being you have to have a sustenance,

21:45.600 --> 21:48.800
and this is the centre that gradually unfolds

21:49.000 --> 21:52.720
the sustenance from animal to higher animals

21:52.920 --> 21:56.760
and to human stage, where a person starts realising

21:56.960 --> 21:59.760
that these sustenance’s exist within us.

21:59.960 --> 22:03.440
That's how all our laws have come.

22:03.640 --> 22:06.040
The Ten Commandments of the Bible

22:06.280 --> 22:08.880
are the ten sustenances that are within us.

22:09.240 --> 22:12.280
These are the ten Gurus who came on this earth

22:12.480 --> 22:18.560
to save human beings from getting out of the middle path,

22:18.760 --> 22:23.800
going more to the left and more to the right.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.880
Now the left side, as you see here,

22:27.080 --> 22:29.880
is the side which is the emotional side within us,

22:30.120 --> 22:32.840
is also the power of desire.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.880
Is the emotional side which gives us our subconscious,

22:36.080 --> 22:39.080
and beyond that is our collective subconscious.

22:39.280 --> 22:42.560
On the right-hand side we have another power of action,

22:42.760 --> 22:46.160
that our desire we try to put in the action,

22:46.360 --> 22:50.960
and this power of action gives us our future

22:51.160 --> 22:56.320
and sustains our physical and mental activities.

22:56.560 --> 23:00.280
As a result of that we develop an institution

23:00.480 --> 23:04.840
in our head called 'ego'.

23:05.120 --> 23:10.840
Everyone has it, there's nothing to be frightened of.

23:11.080 --> 23:14.520
When we do something, we feel we have done it

23:14.720 --> 23:18.680
and that is a myth, but still we carry on with the myth

23:18.880 --> 23:22.160
because we have not yet seen the reality.

23:22.360 --> 23:27.600
The another one is the left-side power within us,

23:27.800 --> 23:31.680
by which we receive the aggression of others,

23:31.880 --> 23:37.360
by which we have our past,

23:37.600 --> 23:42.600
gives us an institution as a by-product of our activity,

23:42.800 --> 23:44.840
emotional activity,

23:45.120 --> 23:48.200
an institution like a balloon you will see there,

23:48.400 --> 23:51.800
called as 'super-ego'.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.440
These two things meet in the head just like this

23:55.640 --> 23:57.720
as you grow,

23:57.920 --> 24:00.120
and the calcification takes place

24:00.320 --> 24:03.960
on top of your head near the fontanel bone area,

24:04.160 --> 24:07.800
and this soft area which is pulsating in childhood

24:08.040 --> 24:11.560
becomes completely covered.

24:11.760 --> 24:16.800
Thus you developed your I-ness, you become Mr. X, Y, Z and all that.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.080
You develop your own freedom.

24:19.280 --> 24:22.000
This is the freedom that you have achieved

24:22.200 --> 24:28.320
to be Mr. X, Mr. Y, Mr. Z.

24:28.520 --> 24:33.480
After achieving this you start using the second centre,

24:33.720 --> 24:36.280
which is the centre of your creativity,

24:36.480 --> 24:38.760
the centre of your action.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.960
Animals do not have any ego.

24:41.200 --> 24:44.080
Of course, if they live with human beings they may develop,

24:44.280 --> 24:47.040
but otherwise they have no ego at all.

24:47.240 --> 24:53.280
And if you do something wrong,

24:53.480 --> 24:57.280
you feel hurt, you feel guilty. Animals never feel guilty

24:57.480 --> 24:59.880
because it is in their nature to kill another animal,

25:00.080 --> 25:03.080
it is in their nature to eat, so they never feel guilty.

25:03.320 --> 25:06.040
It's only human beings who'll say, 'Oh, I should not have said this.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.600
I should have not done this.'

25:07.800 --> 25:10.880
This is only human quality that we feel guilty,

25:11.080 --> 25:16.560
it is only human quality that we aggress others.

25:17.080 --> 25:22.680
So the second centre comes into play by which you think,

25:22.880 --> 25:27.880
and you think about the future, you plan.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.920
Your physical -
I think it's too much now, can you stop it?

25:32.120 --> 25:36.560
Can't you stop it? Better stop the light, it's too much.

25:37.440 --> 25:41.320
I've been having this all throughout, it's too much)

25:43.680 --> 25:50.840
- and you think; for that thinking you require energy,

25:51.120 --> 25:55.720
and this energy you get from the cells of fats

25:55.920 --> 26:00.920
that are in the stomach, which are converted for the use of brain.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.800
And when this conversion takes place,

26:04.000 --> 26:07.680
this poor centre has to work very hard.

26:07.880 --> 26:11.960
When you think, this centre goes into action.

26:12.200 --> 26:16.320
It has to work very, very hard for one work only,

26:16.520 --> 26:20.880
and that is to look after the supply of fat cells.

26:21.080 --> 26:25.880
-It's too many lights they have there. Can you put off these lights?

26:30.080 --> 26:36.040
No, no, no, these three here ...

26:42.560 --> 26:45.360
Thank you ... Still these are very much,

26:45.560 --> 26:47.280
these if they can put off, it would be better.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.760
No, no, these three. These three are too much.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.680
There's no need at all, there's three, what is there?

26:54.880 --> 26:56.880
I mean, they can’t see Me otherwise?

26:57.240 --> 27:04.600
Can you not see Me? It's like, you feel like
shooting!

27:06.760 --> 27:09.600
So this, this centre

27:09.800 --> 27:13.000
that is what we call the Swadisthana centre

27:13.200 --> 27:20.960
is the centre that gives you your future energy

27:21.560 --> 27:24.400
to think of your future, your planning;

27:24.600 --> 27:27.440
which gives you energy to bring forth

27:27.640 --> 27:29.800
the manifestation of the physical labor,

27:29.960 --> 27:34.120
of physical exercise or physical work.

27:34.360 --> 27:37.440
This poor centre has to work for one work:

27:37.640 --> 27:42.320
to convert the fat for the use of the brain.

27:42.800 --> 27:47.880
Now, if one centre which has to do many other things

27:48.080 --> 27:51.680
starts doing only one work, all other things are
neglected.

27:51.880 --> 27:56.120
As a result of that you develop problems,

27:56.320 --> 28:00.280
because it has to cater to your liver, to your pancreas,

28:00.480 --> 28:05.040
to your kidneys, to your spleen,

28:05.360 --> 28:08.640
and once

28:09.000 --> 28:14.280
it goes into action for one channelized

28:14.760 --> 28:17.080
work it gets programmed for it,

28:17.280 --> 28:19.880
and then it cannot take care of these things.

28:20.080 --> 28:22.720
That's how you develop a bad liver,

28:22.920 --> 28:28.000
you develop a diabetes,

28:28.200 --> 28:30.960
kidney trouble, blood pressures.

28:31.240 --> 28:37.680
Also you develop a very serious disease called blood cancer.

28:37.880 --> 28:42.720
Now, Sahaja Yoga can cure all these troubles.

28:42.960 --> 28:47.880
It's only physical, but it can cure even physical troubles,

28:48.080 --> 28:52.680
because if this centre is brought to its normal behaviour,

28:52.880 --> 28:57.160
if it is made to behave in a very normal way,

28:57.360 --> 29:02.080
you can easily cure all such diseases

29:02.280 --> 29:05.320
which come out of your over activity,

29:05.520 --> 29:09.280
over-thinking, over-imaginativeness.

29:09.480 --> 29:13.200
It's a very dangerous thing to always think about the future.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.680
For example, now we are here sitting down,

29:15.880 --> 29:20.880
we should be comfortably sitting down and talking to each other.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.880
Instead of that we are now, we are thinking

29:23.080 --> 29:25.360
'What am I going to do tomorrow?'

29:25.560 --> 29:27.720
or 'What am I going to do when I go home?',

29:27.960 --> 29:31.040
'How I'm going to cook?', 'What am I going to eat?',

29:31.240 --> 29:35.480
or 'How I am going to take my train?',

29:35.680 --> 29:40.480
all these futuristic behaviours lead you to a

29:40.680 --> 29:42.880
very funny personality.

29:43.080 --> 29:46.080
You become so futuristic that you forget the past.

29:46.280 --> 29:50.720
I met a gentleman who forgot even his own name.

29:50.920 --> 29:53.120
He forgot the name of his father,

29:53.320 --> 29:56.680
he forgot the name of his mother and also,

29:56.880 --> 30:00.480
to the dismay of his wife, her name.

30:00.760 --> 30:02.040
And she started crying.

30:02.240 --> 30:05.040
She said, "Now what to do? He's forgotten everything."

30:05.240 --> 30:10.160
Now he is in a futuristic area. He just knows the future.

30:10.400 --> 30:14.840
Then he was to be pushed back again into the centre;

30:15.040 --> 30:17.440
then gradually he started remembering.

30:17.680 --> 30:20.960
Then he told Me that he's chairman of one of the councils

30:21.200 --> 30:25.440
of a big district place in India,

30:25.640 --> 30:27.440
and he said, he was - he said, "No, I am."

30:27.720 --> 30:29.280
I said, "That's good. That's better.

30:29.480 --> 30:32.800
Now you are in that state where you say "I am."

30:33.000 --> 30:34.400
So this is what happens,

30:34.600 --> 30:37.800
and this is what's going to happen to our societies here,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.280
which is very futuristic.

30:41.680 --> 30:44.320
So to cut it down one can try anything,

30:44.520 --> 30:45.880
you may try anything; for example

30:46.080 --> 30:48.960
you may show pictures of the past and things like that,

30:49.160 --> 30:51.280
but that is not going to bring back the horse.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.320
it's running very fast.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.560
The only thing that can work it out

30:55.760 --> 30:58.600
is the awakening of the Kundalini.

30:58.840 --> 31:01.600
When the Kundalini awakens itself,

31:01.800 --> 31:06.000
She makes the centre enlightened

31:06.200 --> 31:11.160
and the centre itself resumes its normal shape,

31:11.400 --> 31:15.760
its normal behaviour and its normal condition.

31:15.960 --> 31:23.160
Apart from that it has got a dynamic

31:23.520 --> 31:27.320
power or manifestation that this one,

31:27.520 --> 31:33.320
this centre which looks after our attention becomes enlightened,

31:33.600 --> 31:36.120
and our attention becomes enlightened,

31:36.320 --> 31:40.800
and the attention which is enlightened becomes dynamic

31:41.000 --> 31:44.840
in the sense now, sitting down here you can pay attention to anyone

31:45.040 --> 31:47.360
- just pay attention, you don't have to do anything,

31:47.640 --> 31:49.280
just pay attention to that person,

31:49.560 --> 31:51.360
and you can find out on your fingertips

31:51.560 --> 31:54.080
what's the matter with the person.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.440
Thousands of miles he may be!

31:56.640 --> 31:59.520
When Nixon was having trouble, suddenly I don't know,

31:59.720 --> 32:01.800
I said, "Find out about Nixon, how is he?"

32:02.000 --> 32:04.960
And they said, "Ma, he is in a terrible mess."

32:05.240 --> 32:08.600
Christ has said, 'Your hands will speak'. That's the time has come.

32:08.800 --> 32:12.440
These hands which looks so simple;

32:12.680 --> 32:14.320
but they are so intricate,

32:14.560 --> 32:18.000
and so intricately built that the nerve endings

32:18.200 --> 32:24.280
are so microscopic that we cannot understand

32:24.480 --> 32:28.800
how much they can tell us, how far they can go.

32:29.000 --> 32:31.720
When the awakening takes place

32:31.960 --> 32:34.920
you start feeling the vibrations around you,

32:35.120 --> 32:38.840
the all-pervading Power which you have never felt before,

32:39.040 --> 32:43.080
through these fingertips. These fingertips which we neglect,

32:43.400 --> 32:47.000
we misuse them, we use them for wrong things,

32:47.240 --> 32:50.240
these fingertips themselves get enlightened,

32:50.440 --> 32:53.400
and you start feeling them! That's what I said,

32:53.600 --> 32:58.760
that you have to get your awareness which is enlightened.

32:58.960 --> 33:01.960
It's the awareness which has to manifest.

33:02.200 --> 33:05.520
And that's how you start feeling them on your fingers:

33:05.760 --> 33:07.800
It's wrong here, there's wrong there,

33:08.040 --> 33:10.320
you can see where is the problem.

33:10.560 --> 33:14.240
Now all these are related to your centres.

33:14.440 --> 33:16.320
These are five, six and seven;

33:16.520 --> 33:18.520
seven on the left and seven on the right.

33:18.720 --> 33:22.440
So this is about your emotional side, and this is about your right,

33:22.640 --> 33:28.160
about your physical and your rational, or you could say mental side.

33:28.360 --> 33:31.480
So you can make out a person how he is

33:31.680 --> 33:35.920
by just knowing whether you are getting heat from that person,

33:36.120 --> 33:38.480
whether you are getting burning from that person,

33:38.680 --> 33:43.720
whether they are getting numb, whether they are becoming heavy.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.840
And a rapport is established

33:46.040 --> 33:50.480
with the all-pervading Power which informs you, get the messages.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.680
And the messages are so correct

33:52.880 --> 33:55.080
that even if you have ten children who are realised souls

33:55.280 --> 33:58.080
- there are many children these days are born as realised souls.

33:58.280 --> 34:00.200
We don't understand children these days,

34:00.400 --> 34:02.280
but these days there are great children,

34:02.480 --> 34:05.040
and they are born today because the time has come.

34:05.280 --> 34:09.200
This is the time of judgment time, this is the time of resurrection,

34:09.400 --> 34:12.520
this is the time about which people have described

34:12.720 --> 34:14.080
in all the scriptures.

34:14.360 --> 34:16.600
So great people are taking birth.

34:16.800 --> 34:21.960
And these children, if you tie them up their eyes,

34:22.200 --> 34:29.440
and ask them about a person who is sitting facing them,

34:29.680 --> 34:31.360
'What's the problem with this person?',

34:31.560 --> 34:34.360
they will all raise the same finger.

34:34.560 --> 34:37.920
All of them will raise the same finger, even if their eyes are tied,

34:38.120 --> 34:40.920
even if their backs are towards the person,

34:41.160 --> 34:44.280
they can just push back their hands and say.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.400
They are so good, children are so good.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.720
You see, when they put their fingers in the mouth

34:48.920 --> 34:50.080
we sometimes think -

34:50.280 --> 34:53.600
I don't know, Freud, whom I'd call a very half-baked person,

34:53.800 --> 34:57.080
he didn't know much about God and life and nothing at all,

34:57.280 --> 34:59.600
he was very, little bit he knew

34:59.800 --> 35:01.800
- he says that this has something towards sex.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.920
He was nothing but a sex point and he wants everybody

35:04.120 --> 35:06.400
to be a sex point, not a human being.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.240
So this fellow, whatever he may say,

35:09.440 --> 35:12.120
but the truth is that it has nothing to do with sex.

35:12.320 --> 35:15.520
It is that they feel the heat on their fingers,

35:15.720 --> 35:19.320
they actually feel it, and that's how they put it in the mouth.

35:19.520 --> 35:22.080
There are little, little children, I've seen; we have one here

35:22.280 --> 35:25.400
who has come from England,

35:25.680 --> 35:30.120
from London, and there's another one who is from here somewhere,

35:30.440 --> 35:32.560
and she - all of these if you ask them

35:32.760 --> 35:35.360
they will immediately tell you where is the catch,

35:35.560 --> 35:37.840
which chakra is catching.

35:38.040 --> 35:40.120
Now, children you cannot befool them.

35:40.320 --> 35:43.760
They all tell you the same thing, that this is what is happening.

35:43.960 --> 35:47.320
So your awareness is enlightened and your hands,

35:47.560 --> 35:53.600
which have got the sympathetic endings here, tell you.

35:53.800 --> 35:57.520
We can say that now in our central nervous system

35:57.720 --> 36:02.920
we can feel about others and about ourselves.

36:03.120 --> 36:05.480
Now, supposing you are sitting here and

36:05.680 --> 36:07.400
I ask you, "What's the problem with you?"

36:07.600 --> 36:09.920
You would say, "I don't know what's the problem with me is,

36:10.120 --> 36:12.840
I don't know."

36:13.040 --> 36:15.240
But I may be able to tell you what the problem is.

36:15.480 --> 36:18.080
If you go and see the doctor, you will see, that's the problem.

36:18.280 --> 36:23.160
How do you know? You don't have to go to any examination,

36:23.480 --> 36:26.720
for all pathological examination where all your teeth are taken out,

36:26.920 --> 36:29.760
eyes are taken out, and by the time you end up they tell you

36:29.960 --> 36:32.040
you are the healthiest man!

36:32.320 --> 36:34.560
You don't have to go to all these horrible things,

36:34.760 --> 36:37.320
you don't have to waste any money and

36:37.640 --> 36:42.440
try all these frustrating things.

36:42.640 --> 36:47.600
Just putting your hands, you will know about yourself.

36:47.800 --> 36:51.760
And the people who are sahaja yogis will tell you

36:51.960 --> 36:55.440
that this is what is wrong with you, and this is how you cure.

36:55.640 --> 36:58.880
Now the time has come - this is such a fantastic time!

36:59.080 --> 37:02.280
With Sahaja Yoga we have cured so many cancer patients,

37:02.480 --> 37:04.240
so many blood cancer patients.

37:04.440 --> 37:07.240
Recently a girl who is a Sahaja yogini

37:07.440 --> 37:13.880
in New York has cured a blood cancer patient.

37:14.120 --> 37:17.200
This boy was about to die, they had declared that he is going to die.

37:17.400 --> 37:20.800
That's declaration they had given about,

37:21.040 --> 37:22.800
for about fifteen days, they said, he may live,

37:23.000 --> 37:23.960
and then he is going to die.

37:24.200 --> 37:25.720
I mean, that's the only thing they could do.

37:25.960 --> 37:27.840
With all the things poor fellow had gone through:

37:28.040 --> 37:30.480
the boy had come from India, all the money was spent,

37:30.680 --> 37:32.120
and this was the certificate he got,

37:32.320 --> 37:34.680
that he is going to die within fifteen days.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.000
Now somehow these people contacted Me,

37:37.200 --> 37:40.560
and I told them to contact a Sahaja yogini in New York.

37:40.800 --> 37:44.160
And they told that such and such boy is there, his name is Rahul,

37:44.360 --> 37:48.200
he is hardly about sixteen years of age, he had blood cancer.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.480
The boy not only got cured,

37:50.680 --> 37:54.320
he came down to London to see Me, and he's back in his home.

37:54.520 --> 37:57.960
It sounds very fantastic that how can a person who is not a doctor,

37:58.160 --> 38:01.600
who has nothing to do with medicine, can cure?

38:01.800 --> 38:04.480
Beyond all these medicines, beyond all these things

38:04.720 --> 38:08.760
is the subtle Power, the divine Power

38:08.960 --> 38:11.360
from where everything has come out.

38:11.560 --> 38:15.400
If you somehow or other become the owner of that,

38:15.600 --> 38:18.120
or the person who knows how to handle it,

38:18.360 --> 38:21.800
you can cure anyone you want to.

38:22.040 --> 38:25.440
It's not that I'm curing these days, My disciples are curing.

38:25.640 --> 38:30.320
I don't know how many people this Dr. Warren, who was a doctor,

38:30.520 --> 38:35.760
has cured through Sahaja Yoga, which is not a medical science.

38:35.960 --> 38:38.760
How many patients he himself has cured,

38:38.960 --> 38:41.280
he won't be able to count them.

38:41.560 --> 38:44.880
So the whole system is going to change.

38:45.080 --> 38:49.360
Now you are going to become the master of yourself,

38:49.640 --> 38:51.880
of your powers, and all these powers

38:52.080 --> 38:54.480
are going to be released from you.

38:54.720 --> 38:58.760
Now when we say that there were gurus who could cure,

38:58.960 --> 39:03.080
there were gurus who could stop

39:03.280 --> 39:06.560
a growth of a horrible disease and things like that,

39:06.760 --> 39:10.680
we think it's not possible. We think it is an impossible thing.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.680
How can it be? How can we believe it? It's a cock and bull story.

39:13.880 --> 39:17.560
But you yourself when you see manifesting it, you'll be amazed.

39:17.760 --> 39:19.560
Once I was travelling by a ship,

39:19.800 --> 39:23.280
and the captain of the ship, I gave him Realization.

39:23.480 --> 39:29.160
And it so happened that one of the ship's staff

39:29.360 --> 39:31.360
got into the freezer,

39:31.560 --> 39:34.520
and he got choked up and he got pneumonia.

39:34.720 --> 39:39.400
Of course, you see, I was in a position, I was travelling because

39:39.880 --> 39:43.200
My husband was the chairman of that company.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.880
So he would not ask Me to go down,

39:46.080 --> 39:47.640
he thought it was too much to ask Me.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.760
I said, "All right, if you don't allow Me to go down,

39:49.960 --> 39:53.040
you'd better go down to the spot where he is.

39:53.240 --> 39:55.360
Don't send any SOS to call a doctor or anything,

39:55.560 --> 40:00.560
you just go and put your hand on his chest for about five minutes."

40:00.800 --> 40:03.560
His pneumonia got cured completely

40:03.760 --> 40:05.840
and this captain, he could not believe it.

40:06.040 --> 40:07.320
He said, "How could it be?"

40:07.520 --> 40:09.160
I said, "It is! That has happened to you.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.880
Now you have become that - accept it!"

40:12.080 --> 40:14.880
You must assume that power, whatever has been given to you,

40:15.080 --> 40:19.120
as in Sanskrit language we say "viraj."

40:19.400 --> 40:20.520
Assume it.

40:20.720 --> 40:23.760
You see, even if you - I have given a throne, if you don't know

40:24.040 --> 40:27.680
how to assume the power of the throne, to believe into it,

40:27.880 --> 40:30.680
then like a beggar boy, if you put him on the throne

40:30.880 --> 40:33.840
he still sees people coming down, he puts his hand before,

40:34.040 --> 40:37.440
"Give me five rupees. Give me five rupees."

40:37.640 --> 40:39.840
Unless and until you assume these powers

40:40.040 --> 40:42.200
you are still uncertain, but you have got them.

40:42.400 --> 40:45.160
And this is the point which is very difficult

40:45.360 --> 40:46.880
with the western mind specially,

40:47.080 --> 40:49.920
because they cannot believe that they can have these powers.

40:50.120 --> 40:51.480
They just can't believe it!

40:51.680 --> 40:54.440
You tell them but they say, "How can that be?" But it is so.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.240
Now for example, this instrument.

40:56.440 --> 40:58.080
If you take it to a village and tell them

40:58.280 --> 41:01.480
that this will carry your voices around,

41:01.680 --> 41:05.320
or if you take a, say, a television set

41:05.520 --> 41:11.480
and tell them that you can see all kinds of cinemas,

41:11.720 --> 41:16.880
or we can say, a drama and play or music out of this -

41:17.080 --> 41:19.520
he is not going to believe it. He'll say, "This box?

41:19.720 --> 41:22.600
This looks like an ordinary wooden box."

41:22.840 --> 41:26.040
But when you plug in, it shows its power.

41:26.280 --> 41:29.040
In the same way, what you look at human beings

41:29.240 --> 41:36.560
as something very, very ordinary, mundane thing -

41:36.800 --> 41:39.280
for us we take it for granted, ourselves,

41:39.520 --> 41:42.960
we don't know how glorified we are, how great we are,

41:43.160 --> 41:45.960
how God has created us with such difficulty,

41:46.240 --> 41:48.280
with such care, with such love;

41:48.480 --> 41:50.440
for a very special purpose,

41:50.680 --> 41:53.880
that He wants to bestow all His powers upon you.

41:54.080 --> 41:56.960
He wants you to enter into the Kingdom of God

41:57.160 --> 42:02.440
and to enjoy His blessings, His love.

42:02.640 --> 42:05.640
It is something that we cannot believe;

42:05.840 --> 42:08.680
we are so frustrated, we are so disgusted with ourselves,

42:08.880 --> 42:11.080
with our societies, with everything.

42:11.280 --> 42:14.240
But it's not so, it's not so.

42:14.440 --> 42:15.720
It just has to happen.

42:15.920 --> 42:18.840
You are just to be plugged in to the mains and it works,

42:19.040 --> 42:20.800
and it works. It has worked.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.760
It has worked with thousands, and it should work with you.

42:23.960 --> 42:25.760
But the absurd ideas people have,

42:25.960 --> 42:28.920
which is the conception they have that you can pay for it.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.080
I mean, how can you pay for anything that is living?

42:31.280 --> 42:33.400
Have you ever paid anything for that is living?

42:33.600 --> 42:35.840
Like, have you paid anything for getting

42:36.040 --> 42:40.560
a fruit out of a flower? Can you pay to the flower?

42:40.760 --> 42:43.400
"All right, I'll give you one pound, give me a fruit!"

42:43.640 --> 42:45.040
Will it work out?

42:45.240 --> 42:49.120
It's that absurd, that you cannot pay for the living God,

42:49.400 --> 42:51.840
you cannot pay for the living experience

42:52.040 --> 42:55.840
and you cannot pay for the evolutionary process.

42:56.040 --> 43:00.360
It is spontaneous, it is within ourselves, it works out.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.600
But we understand money so much

43:02.800 --> 43:04.520
that we can't understand that is free,

43:04.720 --> 43:06.960
though we have got so many things free.

43:07.200 --> 43:09.320
So many things we have got free,

43:09.560 --> 43:12.920
still we don't understand the importance of free things,

43:13.120 --> 43:16.640
because we think whatever is free cannot be great.

43:16.840 --> 43:21.200
Actually all great things have to be free, otherwise we won't exist,

43:21.440 --> 43:22.960
we won't live.

43:23.160 --> 43:27.840
If we didn't get air to breathe freely, we'll not exist.

43:28.040 --> 43:31.120
If it happens sometimes in the airplane or some place,

43:31.320 --> 43:33.160
you should see, then people realise

43:33.360 --> 43:38.440
the importance of those free things which we take it for granted.

43:38.640 --> 43:40.880
So one has to understand the conception

43:41.080 --> 43:44.720
that we have about God, about achieving Him,

43:45.000 --> 43:49.480
about getting into ourselves, is also faulty.

43:49.680 --> 43:53.080
We think that supposing we stand on our heads, we'll get it.

43:53.320 --> 43:57.080
I mean, standing on our heads if we can get God, then

43:57.280 --> 44:01.280
in all evolutionary process they should have stood on their heads!

44:01.480 --> 44:06.520
Or we think that by running these races we'll get it,

44:06.720 --> 44:10.360
or by eating this kind of food or that kind of food,

44:10.560 --> 44:14.800
or by doing this or that we'll get it - is wrong.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.760
But then you may ask that why all these people in religions said

44:18.960 --> 44:24.560
"Thou shall not commit this, thou shall not do that"?

44:24.800 --> 44:26.960
They said it because these are the things

44:27.200 --> 44:30.040
which are required for our sustenance,

44:30.240 --> 44:33.480
for our balancing as a human being.

44:33.680 --> 44:36.680
We lose our balance if we do not do these things.

44:36.880 --> 44:40.800
We have to have the balance; that's why it was said, "Don't do it."

44:41.040 --> 44:43.320
Human beings have a capacity to go to extremes.

44:43.520 --> 44:47.760
I mean, you tell them something - I have known people,

44:48.080 --> 44:52.040
you just tell them that to cure this particular centre

44:52.240 --> 44:56.080
you have to do this asana or you have to do this kind of a thing.

44:56.280 --> 45:00.480
They will do it hundred times, thousand times in one day.

45:00.680 --> 45:04.480
I mean, I never asked them, I said just once in a while you do it,

45:04.680 --> 45:08.120
or once a week - they'll do it hundred times.

45:08.320 --> 45:10.120
We go to extremes.

45:10.320 --> 45:13.680
And that's why, to strike the balance, these people told us,

45:13.880 --> 45:16.960
"Don't do this, don't do that, don't do that."

45:17.160 --> 45:19.800
But then in our ego we say, "Why not? What's wrong?"

45:20.000 --> 45:22.160
All right, go ahead.

45:22.360 --> 45:24.960
When we tell children, "Don't smoke"

45:25.160 --> 45:27.280
"Why not? All my friends are smoking, I'll smoke."

45:27.480 --> 45:31.200
All right, go ahead - smoke, get cancer,

45:31.400 --> 45:34.160
then you'll have a hole here, breathe through that.

45:34.360 --> 45:37.200
After sometime this will go away, the nose will go away,

45:37.400 --> 45:40.440
and you'll be moving like a machine looking at everyone:

45:40.640 --> 45:43.480
you can't talk, you cannot live like a normal person.

45:43.720 --> 45:48.720
Then you, one realises that, "Oh God, I wish I had not smoked."

45:48.920 --> 45:51.440
But in Sahaja Yoga we don't say, "Don't smoke",

45:51.640 --> 45:53.080
because half of the people will walk off.

45:53.280 --> 45:56.040
We never say "Don't drink," never say anything "don't."

45:56.320 --> 45:58.760
We say, "All right, you are doing it, it's all right."

45:58.960 --> 46:04.000
Let this happen. As soon as this happens you just give up yourself,

46:04.240 --> 46:08.280
because when you have found the highest,

46:08.600 --> 46:12.240
then you don't care for all these small things.

46:12.440 --> 46:15.840
All your habits drop out automatically,

46:16.040 --> 46:17.600
I don't have to force you for that.

46:17.800 --> 46:22.600
You have everything within you, that power, like you get lifted up.

46:22.800 --> 46:27.400
Like a lotus that rises out of the mire by its own force,

46:27.600 --> 46:30.680
you come up and your fragrance fills that mire,

46:30.880 --> 46:32.840
and you are amazed at it yourself.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.840
First you are identified with that mire,

46:36.040 --> 46:39.000
and you think that this is what it is - but it's not so.

46:39.200 --> 46:44.360
When it comes up, that lotus, it spreads its beautiful petals,

46:44.600 --> 46:49.760
and the fragrance gives us that personality which spreads all over.

46:49.960 --> 46:51.960
And that's what is going to happen to you.

46:52.160 --> 46:57.400
All of you are going to be that lotus which looks hidden,

46:57.640 --> 47:03.400
which is absolutely invisible within you,

47:03.600 --> 47:04.920
which is going to open out,

47:05.120 --> 47:09.960
and the fragrance of your divinity is going to spread.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.720
Now today I cannot cover all the centres,

47:12.920 --> 47:14.480
because if I start covering all the centres

47:14.680 --> 47:16.480
it will be a very lengthy thing.

47:16.680 --> 47:19.040
I have covered three centres as you have seen:

47:19.240 --> 47:22.920
the Mooladhara Chakra, the Swadisthana and the Nabhi Chakra,

47:23.120 --> 47:25.600
and others I'll cover later on tomorrow.

47:25.800 --> 47:27.960
But I must talk about the Spirit,

47:28.160 --> 47:34.320
about which we are talking for ages now

47:34.520 --> 47:36.640
that we have to become the Spirit.

47:36.840 --> 47:43.040
Now English language, as you know, "spirit" can be anything.

47:46.360 --> 47:50.080
It's a very ambiguous word:

47:50.280 --> 47:53.360
even to alcohols we call it spirits,

47:53.560 --> 47:55.720
even to the dead souls we call them spirits,

47:55.960 --> 47:58.960
and even to the Spirit that is we are,

47:59.200 --> 48:04.840
the pure being which is called as "atma" in Sanskrit language,

48:05.240 --> 48:06.720
we call the word "spirit."

48:06.920 --> 48:09.840
Here I am saying, talking about that Spirit

48:10.040 --> 48:13.200
which is the pure being within you,

48:13.400 --> 48:15.280
which is a detached being within you,

48:15.480 --> 48:17.600
which is the witness within you,

48:17.800 --> 48:20.400
which sees you all the time, which watches you,

48:20.600 --> 48:24.440
which resides within you as joy and happiness in the heart.

48:24.640 --> 48:27.640
It resides in the heart.

48:28.040 --> 48:32.040
This Spirit is not in our conscious mind,

48:32.240 --> 48:35.120
is not in our central nervous system,

48:35.320 --> 48:37.880
is not under our control.

48:38.080 --> 48:41.520
To give it an analogy, I say that

48:41.720 --> 48:44.800
the left side within us is like the brake

48:45.000 --> 48:49.040
and the right side is like an accelerator in a car.

48:49.240 --> 48:53.520
Now in the car we are learning driving, sitting in the front seat,

48:53.720 --> 48:56.160
and there is the master watching at the back

48:56.360 --> 48:59.480
and seeing the whole play.

48:59.680 --> 49:02.720
Now what you do is to go to the left

49:02.920 --> 49:05.040
- means sometimes you put the brake,

49:05.240 --> 49:06.880
sometimes you put the accelerator,

49:07.080 --> 49:11.760
make mistakes, and then you learn how to drive.

49:11.960 --> 49:16.120
That learning how to drive is the wisdom part of it,

49:16.320 --> 49:18.480
which comes to us through balancing our lives.

49:18.720 --> 49:22.680
Balance is the most important thing to begin with.

49:22.880 --> 49:24.680
But even if you don't have balance -

49:24.880 --> 49:26.960
I have seen in Sahaja Yoga very imbalanced people

49:27.160 --> 49:30.600
get into the balance.

49:30.920 --> 49:33.720
Now this balancing left and right,

49:33.920 --> 49:37.440
or say, of the brake and the accelerator,

49:37.640 --> 49:39.600
gives you a position where you can say

49:39.800 --> 49:42.240
now you have mastered the driving.

49:42.440 --> 49:45.880
But still there is the master sitting at the back.

49:46.200 --> 49:49.280
Then you become the master.

49:49.560 --> 49:52.160
The master is the Spirit within you.

49:52.360 --> 49:58.720
You become the Spirit, and you start watching yourself as a driver.

49:58.920 --> 50:02.280
The whole thing becomes like a play, like a drama;

50:02.480 --> 50:05.080
that you separate yourself and start seeing

50:05.320 --> 50:07.680
everything happening before your eyes,

50:07.880 --> 50:11.320
everything happening just like a drama outside you,

50:11.520 --> 50:13.840
and you are not the part and parcel of it.

50:14.040 --> 50:16.800
So you enter into the area of your axis,

50:17.000 --> 50:20.640
and the periphery loses its impact on you.

50:20.840 --> 50:27.040
You become a person who is silent, blissful, quiet,

50:27.240 --> 50:29.840
and sees the periphery, the movement of the periphery,

50:30.040 --> 50:31.800
but you are not in it.

50:32.000 --> 50:33.560
That's how you become the master,

50:33.760 --> 50:35.560
that's how you become the prophet.

50:35.800 --> 50:38.560
But Sahaja Yoga today has a power

50:38.760 --> 50:42.560
to make the prophets out of the men of God,

50:42.760 --> 50:47.480
and these prophets will have power to make others prophet -

50:47.680 --> 50:51.280
so says William Blake, the great poet of this country.

50:51.480 --> 50:53.880
And that's exactly what Sahaja Yoga is.

50:54.080 --> 50:56.720
He predicted it hundred years back.

50:56.920 --> 51:00.960
And today if you come to Sahaja Yoga, you'll be amazed what you are.

51:01.160 --> 51:05.320
Whatever he has predicted about England

51:05.560 --> 51:10.320
being the Jerusalem of tomorrow, that tomorrow is today.

51:10.640 --> 51:13.760
This country of yours, England

51:13.960 --> 51:16.280
- which is so far, I don't know if people understand

51:16.480 --> 51:19.000
are aware of what this country is,

51:19.200 --> 51:21.680
which is the heart of the universe,

51:21.880 --> 51:25.160
which is the most important part of the universe

51:25.400 --> 51:27.400
- has to become the Jerusalem.

51:27.600 --> 51:31.360
For that, the Englishmen have to come out of their inertia

51:31.560 --> 51:35.720
to see what are their potentials,

51:35.920 --> 51:39.720
to rise up to that point, and that's going to work out.

51:39.920 --> 51:43.880
It's already is working very well in London.

51:44.080 --> 51:46.960
Of course, we can't have too many people

51:47.160 --> 51:52.760
because plastics can be produced in the machines in thousands,

51:52.960 --> 51:55.680
but if you have to have something living it takes time.

51:55.880 --> 52:00.160
But once it takes time, once it comes to its maturity,

52:00.360 --> 52:02.600
I'm sure this great country is going to assume

52:02.800 --> 52:06.680
that status of becoming Jerusalem,

52:06.920 --> 52:09.880
the place of worship

52:10.120 --> 52:13.800
where people have to come to worship.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.320
It's very surprising, things are happening with Sahaja Yoga,

52:17.520 --> 52:19.920
the flower daisy which never had any fragrance,

52:20.120 --> 52:22.840
if you go and see, now is having fragrance.

52:23.040 --> 52:26.400
Most of the English flowers had no fragrance,

52:26.640 --> 52:28.200
they were known by that.

52:28.400 --> 52:32.280
Most of the flowers are now having tremendous fragrance.

52:32.480 --> 52:34.080
You can see for yourself.

52:34.280 --> 52:38.400
All these things are working by nature, are worked out,

52:38.600 --> 52:41.160
they are coming- but what about human beings?

52:41.360 --> 52:45.120
Where are they? What are they doing? Where are they lost?

52:45.360 --> 52:47.520
This is a very sad thing.

52:47.800 --> 52:51.120
I came to London just by chance, I should say,

52:51.320 --> 52:53.680
or maybe that is pre-arranged.

52:53.880 --> 52:58.640
My husband got elected to this job and he had to come.

52:58.840 --> 53:02.240
And this agency of the UN is only placed here.

53:02.480 --> 53:04.840
It's in England. It's nowhere else.

53:05.040 --> 53:07.920
You have only one agency of the UN, that is in England

53:08.120 --> 53:12.720
for which My husband got elected, and so I am here.

53:13.000 --> 53:16.960
Otherwise, I don't think I could have come here like a Guru,

53:17.200 --> 53:23.560
because I don't have any other interest but this.

53:23.760 --> 53:25.600
And I could not have come here otherwise,

53:25.800 --> 53:30.040
because uninvited I would not come to a country,

53:30.280 --> 53:35.560
but I came here as invited person.

53:35.880 --> 53:37.240
It's all working out.

53:37.440 --> 53:39.640
Only you people have to work it out yourself,

53:39.840 --> 53:42.480
and understand not only the dynamism,

53:42.680 --> 53:45.840
the vitality, but the greatest importance is that

53:46.040 --> 53:48.920
at this point you are standing

53:49.120 --> 53:53.640
on the verge of destruction or construction.

53:53.840 --> 53:56.680
And the English people have a special place.

53:56.880 --> 53:59.440
They have to rise up to it,

53:59.640 --> 54:04.040
because they are the cells of the heart.

54:04.240 --> 54:06.080
I'll have this lecture tomorrow again.

54:06.360 --> 54:08.760
I'll hope you'll come and make it comfortable.

54:09.000 --> 54:09.880
Sorry for My throat,

54:10.080 --> 54:12.880
I have been speaking day in and day out, every day.

54:13.080 --> 54:16.000
Thank you very much.

54:18.440 --> 54:23.520
If you have any questions, I would like to answer them.

54:59.120 --> 55:06.120
Can I have (answers) , questions from you and then I’ll answer.

55:29.520 --> 55:32.840
You said You could cure after Self-Realization.

55:33.040 --> 55:40.960
His problem is that his mother is deaf.

55:44.400 --> 55:49.040
Can You fix that hearing problem?

55:50.560 --> 55:55.480
You see this question is such

55:56.240 --> 56:00.960
that it makes you feel that I am a person who have to cure everyone.

56:01.560 --> 56:03.560
You are sadly mistaken.

56:03.760 --> 56:07.880
It's a by-product of awakening of the Kundalini, you get cured.

56:08.240 --> 56:11.320
I'm sorry for that, that you have this understanding

56:11.520 --> 56:13.560
that I'm here to cure all the people.

56:13.760 --> 56:16.200
I should settle down in a hospital.

56:16.520 --> 56:19.840
But main thing is Kundalini has to be awakened

56:20.160 --> 56:21.880
to get you cured. All right?

56:22.160 --> 56:25.880
If your mother was here we could work it out.

56:26.120 --> 56:28.160
But the main thing you must understand,

56:28.360 --> 56:32.280
that God has lot of common sense as we have,

56:32.480 --> 56:36.280
and He is only interested in such lights

56:36.480 --> 56:45.120
as we are, which will work out His work.

56:45.320 --> 56:51.400
Those who are, say, very sick people, extremely sick,

56:51.600 --> 56:54.240
can get cured in a second.

56:54.440 --> 56:57.400
You'll be amazed I'll tell you,

56:57.800 --> 57:03.160
our President of India, he went to America for his treatment

57:03.360 --> 57:09.560
and it failed. And he was going back to India.

57:09.800 --> 57:14.440
And I went to see him as Mrs. So and So.

57:14.680 --> 57:16.880
But the High Commissioner told him that

57:17.160 --> 57:19.360
I'm So and So and he had heard My name in India.

57:19.600 --> 57:22.360
His wife said, "Why don't you cure my husband?"

57:22.640 --> 57:25.680
And he was just on his last ...

57:25.920 --> 57:30.320
they had prepared everything for his last rites in India.

57:30.520 --> 57:35.120
I just put My hand on his back for ten minutes, you won't believe,

57:35.360 --> 57:37.840
he had not slept for days together with pain,

57:38.040 --> 57:40.240
he said, "My pain is relieved, I want to sleep",

57:40.480 --> 57:42.520
and he got up, he was perfectly all right.

57:42.720 --> 57:45.360
He walked down, people had brought stretchers and things.

57:45.560 --> 57:48.320
He just walked down. They couldn't believe their eyes.

57:48.520 --> 57:52.640
But this has happened because

57:52.840 --> 58:00.560
he is going to be used for the work of God.

58:00.800 --> 58:04.280
In our house if you have lights

58:04.480 --> 58:07.600
which are never going to give light, we don't bother about them.

58:07.800 --> 58:10.560
We sell them in the junk.

58:10.800 --> 58:20.160
In the same way, the Divine doesn't cure people, all of them.

58:20.360 --> 58:24.200
It does many thousands

58:24.400 --> 58:27.560
but some of the people who are very sick,

58:27.760 --> 58:30.760
He says, "All right. You go through the second cycle.

58:30.960 --> 58:33.800
All right? Come back purified,

58:34.000 --> 58:37.240
rested and then it works out."

58:37.440 --> 58:42.560
So not necessarily that everybody will be cured, not necessarily.

58:43.080 --> 58:48.480
But so many have got cured and it has worked.

58:48.680 --> 58:53.320
But that's not our main job, is to give cures to people. No.

58:53.520 --> 58:58.080
It is to give realisation to people and as a by-product as you said,

58:58.280 --> 59:03.280
of course if she gets realisation, her deafness will go away.

59:03.600 --> 59:06.240
Many people have cured their deafness.

59:06.440 --> 59:10.040
Not only deafness but even bald headed people have got hair.

59:10.240 --> 59:15.960
He had no hair on his head when he came to Me, but I don't say;

59:16.320 --> 59:19.920
that after realisation and before realisation, so tremendous

59:20.120 --> 59:24.320
that it's better to take photographs before realisation

59:24.520 --> 59:26.240
and see yourself - dump sometimes!

59:26.440 --> 59:28.360
After realisation people,

59:28.560 --> 59:30.560
see, they have got their photographs before realisation,

59:30.800 --> 59:33.680
they have thrown them away.

59:34.480 --> 59:35.920
It is different.

59:36.240 --> 59:40.400
But the main thing is not curing, it's the Self-realization.

59:40.880 --> 59:44.400
That's the main thing! And age has no problem.

59:44.600 --> 59:47.800
Yesterday I think in Birmingham, we gave realisation to somebody

59:48.000 --> 59:51.920
who was a very, very old man. So age has no consideration,

59:52.120 --> 59:54.840
health has no consideration, nothing of the kind.

59:55.040 --> 59:58.920
Everyone can get it and should try to get it.

59:59.280 --> 01:00:02.920
All right? So if you can get her, we'll work it out.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:05.840
But I don't promise anything. All right?

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:08.800
May God bless you.

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:13.600
Of course, Self-realization I promise! That I promise.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:18.440
If you have patience with yourself as I have with you.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.800
You have to have patience.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.200
Any other question please?

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.440
He has had chest problems for last four or five years.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.960
Is there any way You can help him?

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.880
Of course, that can be helped.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:42.160
Yes, chest problem like breathing trouble or what?

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:45.560
Breathing trouble? Is he an Indian?

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.680
Asthma. Are you an Indian?

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.840
Ahh, Indians you know.

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.920
They take so much bath. They still think they are in India.

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.360
Everyday take bath in the morning and then go out.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:00.400
Isn't it? That should not be done. This is England.

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:03.840
We should take bath in the night. We should live like English people.

01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:06.840
They are great bathers. Indians are great bathers, you see,

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.200
they must have bath every day

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.920
whether it is zero degrees or minus twelve degrees.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:16.920
They must have bath, you see, it's a habit formation they have got.

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:19.160
They don't feel all right without a bath

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.680
and that's how they develop, but in any case we'll cure your asthma.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:25.200
All right? It's not so difficult.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:29.680
But one should not take too much bath in England.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:33.680
I would suggest that if you want to take bath, take it in the night

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.720
as the English people do, because it's a very treacherous climate.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.400
And if you take your bath and get out of your bath,

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:45.240
you are definite to catch these troubles in the chest.

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:49.200
Not only that but arthritis and all these things come out of this.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.720
This is very indiscriminating in this country.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:56.560
The climate is such you have to be careful.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.960
I mean, one should not postpone bathing forever.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:05.880
Because, you see, when I say something

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.400
I must give the other extreme also.

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:11.880
But we are great bathers, no doubt you see.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.600
Personal cleanliness is too much with Indians, too much.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:18.880
But general cleanliness or you can say the collective cleanliness

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:22.840
is more here, you see. Like mowing the lawn and

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.560
looking after the cleanliness of the roads and all much better.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.440
I mean, we have to combine these things. It's important.

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.000
That can work out. All right? Asthma is not such a problem.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.440
What else?

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.880
In what way does it work out?

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:44.280
We have a centre within us which is the centre of Shri Rama

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:46.840
on the right hand side, we call it the right heart.

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.080
And, if we can cure that centre of yours,

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.880
you'll be all right. All right?

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:58.960
We'll work it out. We'll tell you how to do it.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.160
How many thousands of years

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:16.960
does the yoga date back from?, she said.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.720
Which yoga you mean?

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:24.640
Yoga as being the spontaneous Yoga has been there throughout.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:27.720
You see, what is spontaneous is living.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.520
And the living process has been there throughout.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:35.400
So we cannot say when it started.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.880
We can say when it got separated.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.880
When God and His Power separated

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.760
and God started watching the whole thing as a witness,

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:48.040
the God Almighty, and His Power started working it out,

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.800
it created all the universes,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.360
it created our universe out of which it created now human beings.

01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:59.760
And now, it has to become one again.

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:04.240
That creation has to know its Creator.

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:12.080
One, two, three, four - there have been always few people

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.840
getting this connection,

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:18.200
but today is the time for en masse evolution.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:23.200
So, for a growth of life you cannot give any time.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.680
You can't say when it started,

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:28.720
how many years back it has been on.

01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.960
But today is the blossom time

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:34.760
when many have to get the blessings of yoga.

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:37.840
All right? Thank you.

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:52.200
What is it?

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.320
You spoke about Kundalini.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:58.960
For the ordinary person, it's very difficult to awaken.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:03.360
Ah, who's told you that? It's not so.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.200
You see it is these abnormal people

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.800
when they talk about Kundalini they call it abnormal

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.520
because they don't know how to do it. It's the easiest thing to do.

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:15.240
It's the easiest thing to do if you are an awakened person.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:17.840
Even a child can do it.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:22.440
It's those people who say that Kundalini is very difficult

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:26.120
are the people who have no idea of Kundalini at all.

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:32.120
They are not masters. For a master what is difficult?

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.200
And even an ordinary can become a master,

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:37.400
then what is difficult?

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:42.160
These are not masters. These are people absolutely naive,

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:46.880
money makers, useless people.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:50.840
They write books without knowing anything about
Kundalini.

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.120
They are the misguiding people.

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.120
It's the easiest thing to do.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:58.520
Just under your hand it will move, you will see it moving up

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.400
and you will see it pulsating on the head.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:02.840
It's not at all difficult.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:05.880
I told you it's the most vital thing that has to happen

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:12.440
and all that is vital has to be free and easy - sahaja.

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.920
Why? In India we had Nanaka who said,

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:19.800
"Sahaja samaadhi laago. Sahaja samaadhi laago."

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:24.120
Nobody said it is difficult. Kabira never said it. He said,

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:28.200
"Paacho pachiso pakar bulau ek hi dor bandhahu."

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:32.840
I'll get twenty-five people together and put them onto one thread.

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:36.360
Those who had the authority always talked like that.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:39.080
Nobody said it is difficult.

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:44.600
It's only these people who do not know the job,

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.560
who have no authority, talk like that.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.040
Don't believe them.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.840
It's the easiest thing to do. You will see yourself.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:57.840
But supposing it is easiest, then why should we deny it?

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.800
Supposing I've got the diamond for you free,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.240
won't you see it, won't you have it?

01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:09.920
Or are we going to feel, "Oh it's very difficult. How can we do?"

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:13.960
When I am saying it is easy. You don't have to pay for it.

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:16.960
All right?

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.160
What's it?

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:31.120
No, that's correct. Sit down, sit down.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.880
All right, all right. Please sit down. I'll tell you.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.280
That's the method people tried. It doesn't work out that way.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:45.240
Say, your car, is something wrong with your car, all right?

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:51.320
Now, can you clean it from sitting inside it?

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:56.200
Can you put it right? You have to get out of it.

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:59.600
So first the Kundalini rising has to be done.

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:01.800
You see, people have confused everything.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.480
Even in Hatha Yoga where there are ashtangas,

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:12.400
first thing is Ishwar Pranidhana. First is the establishment of God!

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.200
First you have to be connected with God.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.440
Even in Christianity you have to be baptized first.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.400
Of course, it's an artificial one, forget it,

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.480
but you have to be baptised.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.520
Even as a Hindu you have to be christened in a way

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:28.240
what you call a Yagnopavita, is done at the age of eight years.

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:33.200
That's what realisation is.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.840
Or Mohammed Sahib and all these people use Sumta (no thoughts),

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.440
that's the same thing.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.840
So the first thing is to get your realisation.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:44.440
It doesn't mean that you become a master.

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:45.960
But awakening of the Kundalini

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.280
and then with the growth of the Kundalini you become a master.

01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:53.240
This was the real process but they have put it upside down now.

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:56.040
How can you cleanse yourself

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.680
unless and until you get out of it?

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.840
Supposing My sari is spoilt,

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.640
I have to take out My sari and clean it. Isn't it?

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:09.520
And that's why it is difficult.

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.880
That is it. It's a confusion they have created.

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:15.160
And don't believe in all these stories.

01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:18.560
If you try to suppress your ego, it will sit on your head.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.160
Never it will run away.

01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:25.640
If you try to suppress your super-ego, it will never help you.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.720
But here automatically it happens,

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.600
and how it happens I'll tell you tomorrow.

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:32.200
By awakening these deities within yourself

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:36.000
these things are sucked in. Kundalini awakens and does it.

01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:38.600
And last of all, if you want Me to confess,

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:41.720
there is something special about Me that I can do it.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:44.640
Must be something.

01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:51.040
If you don't crucify Me, I'll say that much, not more.

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:52.360
You better find out.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.880
Otherwise the first thing you will do is to crucify Me.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:00.600
I don't want it anymore.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:06.160
All right? May God bless you.

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:10.440
Yes, My child?

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:25.720
It's not any surgery needed for that.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:29.120
In Sahaja Yoga, we have techniques,

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:34.400
divine techniques by which we open our heart.

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:38.360
The confusion is on another line also,

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:41.320
and this confusion has led us into problem.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:45.960
You see, the confusion is about how our relationships

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:51.200
should be to ourselves, to others and to the society.

01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:55.440
There's a big confusion that started long time back.

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.160
When the Smritis were written,

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:59.320
or we can say when the religion was practiced

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:02.440
it was just the other way round. We started doing everything

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:07.920
and that's how we have lost that capacity.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.960
The attitude towards ourselves should be

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.920
that we should try to perfect ourselves.

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:17.120
It's absolutely tyrannical I tell you.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:21.840
When I tried to perfect Sahaja Yoga, I am tyrannical towards Myself.

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:24.320
The amount of work I take out of this body

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:28.640
and the amount of exertions I can put in out of this body,

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.960
the stretching of My complete patience to a great extent

01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:33.920
- I work it out.

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.760
I mean, normally you know, people get just clenched up,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.640
"Oh Mother, this is too much. We can't bear."

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.160
You have seen it yourself.

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:43.880
But you have to be really tyrannical to perfect yourself.

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:47.720
That should be the way we should work it out

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.120
towards ourselves.

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:54.240
And towards others it should be an ideal relationship.

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:57.240
Like now you have a brother, he is your brother

01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:58.960
- should be ideal brother.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:03.040
If he is your father, he should be an ideal. But such a confusion!

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:05.440
The more enlightened, so-called, you become,

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:07.560
the more elevated you become,

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.400
the confusion is: who is your sister, who is your mother,

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.960
who is your father?

01:12:13.840 --> 01:12:17.880
Then the relationship between the Sahaja yogis also becomes confused.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.880
You are Sahaja Yogis, you are all prophets,

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.240
you must respect each other.

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.760
You are all prophets, you speak the same language.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:26.560
You have to love each other.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.640
It's not rational, it has to happen to you

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.840
because the relationship has to be established,

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.400
that relationship, that ideal relationship.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.520
So many people now you have known that get angry with Me,

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:40.040
"Mother, You are too patient with the Sahaja yogis."

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:45.520
But they are My children. I have to perfect Myself,

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:48.400
and My relationship with them should be ideal.

01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.480
I have to go to a great extent forgiving them

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:54.160
so that they come up.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.880
So relationship with others should be ideal.

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:59.840
Are you an ideal father? Are you an ideal mother?

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:03.800
Are you an ideal sister and a brother?

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:08.520
Are you an ideal citizen towards others?

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:11.840
But the society has to be pragmatic.

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:15.160
The society has to work it out pragmatically,

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:18.520
and the pragmatic working out comes by changing.

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.920
Supposing today I would say that for India

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.440
we don't need vegetarianism.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:28.720
For England we need vegetarianism.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:32.680
It's all pragmatic. The society has to be pragmatic.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:36.160
Here, we are pragmatic about ourselves,

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.680
not about the society, we are pragmatic about ourselves.

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:42.640
Everything works out. "What's wrong?"

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.480
A woman who has children will run away with another man.

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.600
"What's wrong?"

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:50.720
Or a woman who has children can sell

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:56.240
the country for the sake of her children. "What's wrong?"

01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:00.280
So this confusion within us creates this problem,

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:03.560
and that's how we do not know how to open out ourselves.

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:07.520
If we could get rid of our confusions, it could be all right.

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:09.960
It can be done through Sahaja Yoga.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:12.920
All these confusions have been created by half-baked people

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.320
I would say.

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:19.280
Like there's nothing wrong with the incarnations, with the prophets,

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:23.600
nothing wrong with them, they are perfect people.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.240
What is wrong with us is our attitude.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:29.720
And if we can discriminately use our attitude

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:34.120
towards ourselves, towards others and towards the society,

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:39.440
everything will work out. It's going to be beautiful.

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:44.800
Because of this confusion our heart is closed.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.240
We are frightened of others. What is there to be frightened?

01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:53.600
Relationship is ideal. What can we do?

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.800
Your relationship as far as they are concerned,

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.480
your relationship, your heart is ideal.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:00.960
Whatever they do is not the point.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:04.480
Whatever I do for them has to be ideal.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:08.480
I have to go on loving them.

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:12.840
I have to go on admiring them, encouraging them, sustaining them

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:16.800
and giving them what I have to do as My relationship has to.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:24.640
Say for example, a source of water that is under the Mother Earth -

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:28.400
does it think what kind of a tree it is,

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.400
what sort of things it is doing?

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:33.800
It just gives its source, its water.

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:38.760
In the same way, because you are the source,

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:41.600
so the relationship has to be ideal.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.720
These confusions have worked out

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:46.640
and rationally we have accepted all these confusions.

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:50.200
And this has led us into this kind of a trap

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.720
that our hearts are closed.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.280
All right?
