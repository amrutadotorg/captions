10:16.340 --> 10:23.340
Today is the third day of the Moon.

10:42.045 --> 10:47.314
Third day of the Moon is Tritiya,

10:48.693 --> 10:58.280
is the special day for the virgins.

10:58.959 --> 11:05.128
Kundalini is the virgin desire.

11:05.165 --> 11:12.014
It is virgin because it has not yet manifested itself.

11:16.252 --> 11:25.722
And also, on the third center of Nabhi,

11:30.334 --> 11:39.327
the virgins appear as shaktis of Guru.

11:40.365 --> 11:45.703
As we have got ten Gurus which we regard as the main Gurus

11:45.743 --> 12:08.681
they all had either their sister or daughter as their shakti.

12:26.607 --> 12:38.177
In the Bible it is said that, in the Old Testament, that

12:39.477 --> 12:50.182
the one who will be coming will be born of a virgin.

12:54.070 --> 12:59.067
And then the Jews would not accept Christ

12:59.092 --> 13:10.377
so they said that “It’s not written as virgin,
it’s written ‘the girl’.”

13:12.140 --> 13:18.295
Now in Sanskrit Language ‘girl’
and ‘the virgin’ are one word.

13:18.607 --> 13:24.292
We did not have 80-year-old girls as we have nowadays.

13:24.913 --> 13:30.683
So the virginity of a woman meant

13:30.716 --> 13:36.771
that she was a girl who was not married as yet

13:38.975 --> 13:45.975
or who has not met her husband so far.

13:48.443 --> 13:54.061
That is the essence of purity,

13:55.635 --> 14:02.884
which was the power of the Guru Principle.

14:04.195 --> 14:18.761
So, for a Guru who is in charge of
leading others into enlightenment,

14:19.466 --> 14:28.851
has to know that his power is to be used
as a virgin power of pure power.

14:29.399 --> 14:37.137
A Guru cannot use his power

14:41.893 --> 14:48.893
in a way an ordinary person can use it.

14:49.319 --> 14:55.105
So his relationship with his disciples

14:55.130 --> 15:03.935
whether they are boys or girls
has to be absolutely pure.

15:05.867 --> 15:10.904
The purity should be of such a limit

15:11.548 --> 15:21.517
that a Guru should not accept anything from the disciples.

15:25.519 --> 15:32.712
About this, lots of things have been written by
many saints especially in Maharashtra.

15:32.737 --> 15:37.784
Also Kabirdas and Nanaka have clearly talked against the people

15:37.809 --> 15:43.472
who have relationship with their shishyas, or disciples,

15:43.760 --> 15:48.336
either with greed or with lust.

15:48.631 --> 15:52.678
They have called them as rakshasas.

15:53.810 --> 16:01.870
In the same way the people who are today,

16:02.671 --> 16:09.356
supposed to be the leaders, the Gurus, in Sahaja Yoga,

16:09.760 --> 16:16.287
have to remember that their relationship

16:16.414 --> 16:27.524
with their disciples has to be of complete
purity and virginity.

16:30.691 --> 16:35.840
In the olden days it was all right

16:37.586 --> 16:44.466
that people did not know about the punishments
that can fall upon such a person

16:44.491 --> 16:53.342
who uses his power as a Guru for his own gratification.

16:54.354 --> 17:02.376
But today at this time when at this time when...

17:46.051 --> 17:50.980
The punishment that can take place

17:52.058 --> 17:58.951
in those days of last judgement could be very severe

17:59.311 --> 18:03.491
and as a Mother I have to warn all of you,

18:03.665 --> 18:07.264
those who have started their centers

18:07.288 --> 18:17.153
or those who are becoming Gurus as leaders

18:17.956 --> 18:21.544
that you have to have a very detached mind

18:21.561 --> 18:28.925
and clear cut understanding within yourself.

18:29.265 --> 18:32.485
You can not mishandle money.

18:32.510 --> 18:36.941
You can not misappropriate money,

18:36.966 --> 18:42.634
you can not use anything for your own purpose

18:42.659 --> 18:45.719
which belongs to the collective.

18:46.910 --> 18:58.054
Nor could you use anyone for the gratification of your lust.

18:58.283 --> 19:03.314
If you have any such weaknesses
is better to get out of Sahaja Yoga

19:03.339 --> 19:08.505
for the time being and come back when you are better off.

19:09.639 --> 19:14.686
There is no place in Sahaja Yoga for impure people.

19:14.862 --> 19:20.100
Purity is to be worshipped out and out.

19:22.485 --> 19:28.940
As we say that in the West there’s sin against the Mother.

19:29.321 --> 19:33.065
People don’t value their chastity

19:34.326 --> 19:40.201
but in the East, specially in India,

19:40.226 --> 19:43.873
people don’t know that they have to be absolutely honest

19:43.898 --> 19:47.714
as far as their money is concerned.

19:49.175 --> 19:53.838
They fall into traps, into temptations

19:54.142 --> 19:59.797
and then they get a very severe punishment,

19:59.853 --> 20:07.215
not through Me but through the wrath of God almighty

20:07.240 --> 20:13.540
because this is God’s work we are doing.

20:16.446 --> 20:24.860
And the worst thing could be that we seek power.

20:25.876 --> 20:31.613
If not these two things, we seek power in Sahaja Yoga.

20:34.372 --> 20:41.172
To them it becomes like their own domain

20:41.485 --> 20:49.219
and they start using, asserting, their power over others.

20:53.202 --> 20:59.064
This cannot be possible.
It will not work out.

20:59.563 --> 21:07.155
Those who will try to dominate
others just for the satisfaction

21:07.180 --> 21:14.727
of their own ego will suffer a lot.

21:16.194 --> 21:25.965
Now the fourth type are the people who try
to put their conditionings on Sahaja Yoga.

21:26.203 --> 21:30.390
Like somebody who is a Hindu

21:30.415 --> 21:36.996
and he is fasting say, most of the days they fast,
I don’t know which one is fasting.

21:37.328 --> 21:42.325
So he’s fasting say, on a Saturday

21:42.919 --> 21:47.115
and he tells people that see now, I have to fast on Saturday

21:47.147 --> 21:53.341
because after all, you see, I have been fasting
for all these days and all that.

21:54.102 --> 22:00.326
Or who has got conditioning, like,
I would like to marry only a foreigner

22:00.351 --> 22:05.562
if I am a foreigner or if I am an Indian I’ll marry an Indian.

22:06.300 --> 22:12.586
All such conditions if a leader tries to put forward

22:12.594 --> 22:19.489
and saying that, “Mother said so,”
he’ll be doubly punished.

22:26.248 --> 22:42.893
We are belonging to the True Religion of a true, pure universality.

22:43.971 --> 22:51.187
None of these artificial things can bind us.

22:56.799 --> 23:04.508
This is one of the very important subtle things,

23:04.533 --> 23:09.916
which we don’t understand –
that we are very much conditioned.

23:09.964 --> 23:13.829
“We the English”, “we the Indians”

23:18.247 --> 23:23.488
or “We x,y, z”.

23:23.663 --> 23:27.451
You are human beings.

23:27.642 --> 23:30.832
God made only one world.

23:31.234 --> 23:33.355
He didn’t make all these things.

23:33.363 --> 23:35.732
It’s all artificial, man-made.

23:36.479 --> 23:42.395
You are born of one Mother

23:42.420 --> 23:45.545
and you are yogis

23:45.570 --> 23:51.132
who have no bondages of this artificial nature.

23:54.690 --> 24:00.011
Everyone who claims to be a Guru has to realise

24:01.519 --> 24:07.275
that he can not bound himself to any particular mundane,

24:07.298 --> 24:11.218
outdated nonsensical ideas.

24:15.612 --> 24:22.898
Gradually whatever the leaders will do
will be followed by the followers.

24:23.141 --> 24:32.304
So the leader has to lead a life which is an ideal.

24:33.945 --> 24:39.752
A leader who is very dominating,

24:39.776 --> 24:42.863
or who is very possessive or aggressive,

24:42.884 --> 24:47.033
will create leaders who will be of the same nature.

24:47.058 --> 24:49.927
The another one who is very much conditioned

24:49.952 --> 24:55.070
will create conditioned followers.

24:56.118 --> 25:01.441
And may be, I may not find any relationship with them.

25:01.885 --> 25:07.096
So we don’t want to have a priest class as Gurus.

25:07.747 --> 25:11.837
Priests are different from Gurus.

25:12.885 --> 25:19.339
We do not want people to take upon themselves the laws of God

25:19.363 --> 25:23.917
and use them for their own purposes.

25:26.526 --> 25:33.526
Today is the day of the Gurus

25:34.093 --> 25:45.333
because is the third day, the third Chakra of the Nabhi.

25:45.935 --> 25:57.024
The same one we have the starting point of the Mahalakshmi.

25:58.699 --> 26:07.182
Mahalakshmi energy starts

26:08.046 --> 26:15.580
working after you have finished with the Lakshmi tattwa.

26:16.934 --> 26:25.268
If the Gurus are still with,
busy with the Lakshmi tattwas,

26:25.731 --> 26:32.731
have no sense of sacrifice,
have no sense of detachment

26:33.401 --> 26:36.771
they cannot be called as leaders.

26:38.834 --> 26:47.012
The Mahalakshmi is the subtle form of our hankering,

26:47.704 --> 26:53.517
of our desires, is the subtlest, the epitome.

26:53.667 --> 27:01.145
Because first we search for power

27:01.772 --> 27:10.281
through physical, mental, emotional and ultimately

27:11.320 --> 27:17.290
we want to have spiritual powers also to impress others.

27:18.575 --> 27:26.169
In Sahaja Yoga you come here to dissolve all your powers.

27:28.788 --> 27:31.095
You become so powerless

27:31.120 --> 27:37.140
that all the powers of God Almighty
start working through you.

27:37.140 --> 27:42.116
Supposing this instrument has some powers (microphone)

27:42.735 --> 27:45.234
I won’t be able to handle this.

27:45.259 --> 27:48.861
It would be going here, there and there.

27:52.732 --> 28:00.175
So to worship Mahalakshmi one has to remember

28:00.600 --> 28:04.674
that you must dissolve all your powers.

28:04.699 --> 28:09.510
That is the surrender that is what is ‘Islam‘ as they call it.

28:09.534 --> 28:12.705
But these are all words for people.

28:12.991 --> 28:17.662
Surrender is a very difficult thing to understand
for human beings.

28:17.687 --> 28:19.348
They think “I can’t surrender.”

28:19.373 --> 28:25.395
What do you have to surrender, is nothing
but your ego and your conditioning.

28:25.420 --> 28:28.542
All these things I am telling you

28:28.582 --> 28:33.536
but if you learn them by heart like a parrot, you can repeat.

28:33.829 --> 28:38.230
That will have no influence on your followers.

28:38.568 --> 28:42.806
Unless and until you show in your own life

28:43.187 --> 28:56.462
that beauty, that composer, that
care, that concern, that love,

28:57.174 --> 29:02.620
nobody is going to listen to a parrot.

29:05.557 --> 29:13.606
The meaning has to come
from the practices not from the precepts.

29:16.026 --> 29:20.085
This is what Sahaja Yoga [is], which is very different

29:20.109 --> 29:27.109
from any other spiritual announcements.

29:29.009 --> 29:31.397
So be careful!

29:31.422 --> 29:40.904
You have been chosen by your merit as sahaja yogis,

29:40.912 --> 29:45.396
so respect yourself.

29:45.999 --> 29:48.578
May God bless you!
