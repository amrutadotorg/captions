About Indian Sages
Aurangabad, India, 19 December 1989

00:06.563 --> 00:09.487
So now most of you are here,

00:09.527 --> 00:21.425
and it’s a nice place for all of you
to meet from different countries.

00:22.718 --> 00:27.976
Aurangabad has a special significance in my own life

00:27.993 --> 00:34.581
because my forefathers came from
a place very near from here,

00:34.606 --> 00:39.250
called as Pathan
but originally known as Pratishthan.

00:39.275 --> 00:44.634
I think about two years back we were there,

00:45.151 --> 00:52.812
and this is the place where Valmiki,
who wrote the great epic of Ramayana,

00:52.837 --> 00:59.604
lived here. And when Sita came,

00:59.688 --> 01:07.177
was taken away from her house

01:07.412 --> 01:10.585
and when she was pregnant,

01:10.610 --> 01:16.713
there was another ashram of his in Nepal where she stayed,

01:17.372 --> 01:21.422
and then she was brought here.

01:21.441 --> 01:26.980
That’s why you see a kind of a

01:30.210 --> 01:37.308
culture of Maharashtra, going to the hills
and also to Nepal, through her

01:37.333 --> 01:45.080
and her children who went down,
went to Russia and another to China.

01:45.833 --> 01:50.656
The name of one who went to Russia
was Luv,

01:50.681 --> 01:54.085
and another who went to China was Kush.

01:54.110 --> 01:56.942
So they are called as Slavs.

01:56.995 --> 01:59.574
They were mostly called as Lev,

01:59.798 --> 02:03.892
and those who went to China
are called as Kusha.

02:03.917 --> 02:08.171
So they lived here from their birth

02:08.196 --> 02:12.057
till they became about, say, twelve years of age,

02:12.124 --> 02:15.849
when Valmiki composed Ramayana

02:15.881 --> 02:21.053
and taught them how to sing that song of Ramayana.

02:21.196 --> 02:24.766
So then they went to Ayodhya

02:24.791 --> 02:28.716
and there they started singing the song.

02:28.871 --> 02:32.468
With that singing, Shri Rama was very much touched.

02:32.493 --> 02:37.301
They challenged him in a way, that
there is a lady who was such a chaste person,

02:37.326 --> 02:44.153
who was driven out of - they didn’t know
that was Rama was their father.

02:45.320 --> 02:51.113
Then they came back and stayed here

02:52.164 --> 02:57.619
for some time and then went again to Nepal
because  she was a Nepali lady.

02:57.644 --> 03:02.725
So I think her father must have arranged
something for her to stay in Nepal

03:02.750 --> 03:09.112
in that Valmiki ashram,
which can be only approached from Bihar,

03:09.137 --> 03:11.716
which I have seen Myself.

03:13.233 --> 03:19.704
Also that’s a very important spot where
this ashram was established by Valmiki,

03:19.721 --> 03:23.545
because here there was a big struggle of evolution

03:23.570 --> 03:27.092
going on between the big animals like mammoth

03:27.113 --> 03:30.143
and all those big, big animals,

03:30.168 --> 03:33.701
between the others who were very quick to turn

03:33.726 --> 03:39.735
and were very clever, intelligent and supple.

03:39.942 --> 03:43.627
They destroyed most of these big animals.

03:43.652 --> 03:49.992
And in that river there were lots of crocodiles,

03:50.447 --> 03:57.016
and when the king of the elephant, known as Gajendra,

03:57.041 --> 04:00.920
was drinking in water, one of them, a big one,

04:00.945 --> 04:06.985
attacked to kill him so that the whole clan,

04:07.010 --> 04:13.001
or you can say the whole genii
of these elephants, would be destroyed.

04:14.064 --> 04:17.796
That spot is very important

04:17.821 --> 04:20.384
because there Shri Vishnu appeared

04:20.409 --> 04:23.785
and he killed the crocodile and saved the elephant.

04:23.810 --> 04:27.482
So out of all these
big animals, only the elephant was saved,

04:27.507 --> 04:31.907
and that’s why that place is called as Gajendramoksh.

04:32.026 --> 04:36.781
So there’s a big quarrel going on because
Valmiki had his ashrams in different places,

04:36.781 --> 04:39.446
where [was real of Valmiki’s things].

04:39.471 --> 04:43.203
But actually he lived here in this area

04:43.220 --> 04:46.340
on the other side of the Godavari River

04:46.365 --> 04:53.793
which was going along the

04:54.040 --> 04:58.986
Paithan or the Pratishthan, the kingdom of Shalivana.

04:59.280 --> 05:04.598
And he used to plunder people and he was a plunderer.

05:04.623 --> 05:07.949
He was a fisherman and he was a plunderer.

05:08.720 --> 05:12.646
Then from there they say Narada came as a
saint from there,

05:12.671 --> 05:17.333
from the other side, and they plundered him also.

05:17.358 --> 05:21.075
So he said ,“Why are you plundering me?” Narada asked.

05:21.100 --> 05:25.329
He said, “Because I have to feed my children.
I have to feed my wife.

05:25.354 --> 05:28.161
I have to feed my family. I have to look after them.

05:28.186 --> 05:31.435
I have a large family. So how am I to maintain all that?

05:31.460 --> 05:34.392
I am the only person who is the earning member. “

05:34.417 --> 05:37.692
But he said, “Do you think
they will sacrifice everything for you?”

05:37.717 --> 05:40.580
He said, “I am sure they will.”
He said, “All right."

05:40.605 --> 05:44.120
Now you become like a dead man.”

05:44.145 --> 05:48.067
And they took his dead body, so-called, four of them,

05:48.076 --> 05:51.210
four saints, and put it in the house

05:51.235 --> 05:56.108
and told them that this fellow died in plundering us.

05:56.156 --> 06:00.968
“But there is a way to again bring him to life,

06:00.993 --> 06:05.433
that you have to promise that somebody from you,

06:05.458 --> 06:09.238
you all, have to die in his place.

06:09.263 --> 06:16.263
If you agree that you will die in his place,
then one person has to replace him.”

06:17.935 --> 06:20.608
They tried and tried.

06:20.633 --> 06:24.087
And somebody said, “No, I cannot die. I am too young.”

06:24.112 --> 06:26.987
Another said,“No, I have to look after my children.”

06:27.012 --> 06:31.893
Another said, “What will happen to my grandchildren?”
all kinds of things.

06:31.918 --> 06:35.275
And nobody offered themselves.

06:35.300 --> 06:40.021
So Valmiki got up and he realised that so far

06:40.045 --> 06:43.920
he has been really doing something wrong.

06:44.066 --> 06:48.106
So he said then, “What should I say?”

06:48.131 --> 06:50.580
He said, “What would you say then if you
die?”

06:50.605 --> 06:53.249
He said, “I’ll say, ‘Mara, mara’,” means,

06:53.273 --> 06:55.314
‘I am dead. I am dead. I am dead’.”

06:55.339 --> 06:56.894
He said, “All right, say the other way.

06:56.919 --> 07:00.653
Go on saying.” So it came to,
“Rama, Rama,” like that.

07:00.678 --> 07:02.591
But they said, “It won’t work out.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.596
You have to do a penance

07:04.621 --> 07:07.929
because you have done lots of bad things in your life

07:07.954 --> 07:10.442
and you have hurt many people.

07:10.478 --> 07:13.966
So you have to do the penance.”

07:14.320 --> 07:20.658
So he sat down for penance on a big mountain here

07:20.696 --> 07:23.025
which is called as the Valmiki Mountain.

07:24.328 --> 07:27.214
And the termites ate up his body,

07:27.264 --> 07:29.311
and he became like a termite.

07:29.327 --> 07:31.582
Only his neck was up and he was saying that

07:31.607 --> 07:34.849
and the whole body was eaten up by termites.

07:34.874 --> 07:38.175
So then again Shri Vishnu appeared before him

07:38.200 --> 07:42.420
and removed his termites and gave him his realisation.

07:42.453 --> 07:46.860
And a termite in Sanskrit language is called as valmi.

07:46.885 --> 07:49.500
That’s why he was called as valmi ki. That’s why

07:49.525 --> 07:51.818
he was called as Valmiki.

07:51.843 --> 07:59.548
So the story then afterwards leads
to the coming of Sita there.

07:59.649 --> 08:04.100
So it is a very important part of Ramayana was played here,

08:04.125 --> 08:08.066
and it is said that Shalivahanas helped

08:08.091 --> 08:13.843
this Valmiki temple and Valmiki person to prosper,

08:13.868 --> 08:18.464
and they treated him with great respect as their master.

08:18.489 --> 08:22.469
But actually, their master was long
time back was one Chandalia

08:22.494 --> 08:27.076
where we have taken the land near Nira River.

08:27.093 --> 08:31.575
So it’s a very ancient time thousands of years back

08:31.600 --> 08:36.704
because Rama must have lived before Krishna,
say about eight thousand years back.

08:36.729 --> 08:41.395
So it is a very ancient place, this one is.

08:41.420 --> 08:44.376
After that people removed all the trees and all that.

08:44.401 --> 08:46.852
So it has become such a barren land

08:46.877 --> 08:54.678
and it is not sort of so fertile now,

08:54.703 --> 08:58.893
but once upon a time it was a beautiful forest here

08:58.918 --> 09:03.490
and in that forest Valmiki used to live.

09:03.515 --> 09:05.878
So this is the story of this place, I hope

09:05.903 --> 09:10.146
you will be happy to know you are in a very
historical place just now.

09:10.171 --> 09:13.462
And I am trying to find out if you can on your way go to

09:13.487 --> 09:16.710
also to this Paithan, Pratishthan

09:16.734 --> 09:18.718
on your way, maybe. I don’t know how,

09:18.743 --> 09:21.010
because we are all running short of time

09:21.035 --> 09:24.059
because of aeroplane timings, as you know.

09:24.076 --> 09:27.844
But in any case I am very happy
that also Italians have arrived,

09:27.869 --> 09:30.793
and they have taken so much trouble to come all the way

09:30.818 --> 09:33.846
directly from there to get to the puja.

09:33.855 --> 09:38.734
Though I had arranged in Pratishthan
all their food, everything, breakfast,

09:38.759 --> 09:41.808
so they could sleep in the night and early in the morning

09:41.833 --> 09:45.222
take the food and come here.

09:46.399 --> 09:48.803
All these stories these
people know very well.

09:48.828 --> 09:52.976
We all know everything about our country,
these ancient times,

09:53.001 --> 10:00.434
you see, grand, beautiful, and the
work of all these saints and all these

10:00.459 --> 10:08.737
seers has woven into the character of Maharashtran people.

10:08.762 --> 10:13.702
So you will find them that they have certain gifts

10:13.727 --> 10:18.639
already to protect themselves,
which has come because of the

10:18.664 --> 10:26.445
following of these saints and
the following of a realised soul.

10:26.485 --> 10:29.164
And the people are very God-fearing

10:29.189 --> 10:34.919
and they respect saints and
they also know who is a real saint mostly.

10:37.284 --> 10:41.311
I hope you all will understand that

10:41.335 --> 10:45.128
when we think of the comfort of our spirit,

10:45.158 --> 10:49.659
the whole life is sort of penetrated
with the light of the spirit,

10:49.684 --> 10:52.806
and we start changing our attitude towards life.

10:52.831 --> 10:57.692
Not only that, but also we have a kind of a

10:57.724 --> 11:02.246
tremendous confidence in our virtues
and we enjoy them.

11:02.624 --> 11:07.147
We do not indulge into any such thing.

11:07.180 --> 11:09.452
Though in a way we can say that the,

11:09.477 --> 11:15.170
in this culture there is not much of finesse,
not much of artificiality.

11:15.195 --> 11:18.615
They won’t say thank you a hundred times.
That is not done.

11:18.647 --> 11:20.226
They don’t say sorry.

11:20.251 --> 11:23.142
They won’t even fold their hands to normally,

11:23.167 --> 11:26.587
the women especially to men, and say namaskar.

11:26.612 --> 11:29.251
Only to God they fold their hands.

11:29.284 --> 11:31.656
So there are certain things, that

11:31.681 --> 11:34.367
all the time we go on shaking hands in the West.

11:34.392 --> 11:37.789
All the time we start bowing to everyone, saying sorry,

11:37.789 --> 11:39.537
thank you and all that.

11:39.550 --> 11:41.263
That you will find they don’t do,

11:41.288 --> 11:44.661
but at heart they are very simple people.

11:44.686 --> 11:49.574
They live among rocks; so they
have that rocky character.

11:49.599 --> 11:51.710
And I hope you will enjoy them.

11:51.735 --> 11:54.167
May God bless you.
