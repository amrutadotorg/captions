00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.400
All right. First I would like to tell you about

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.960
the meaning of puja.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.440
There are two aspects.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.560
One is the aspect

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.080
that you have got your own

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.040
deities within yourself.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.720
And these deities are to be awakened within you.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.400
Deities are the different aspects of one God.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.160
So on one side you have the Deities,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.280
means the aspects of God,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.960
which are all the time awakened.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.200
On the other side you have your own Deities,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.840
which are sometimes awakened, sometimes half-awakened,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.840
sometimes sleeping and sometimes sick.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.720
So you have to use two methods:

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.680
one to please the Deities

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.200
of God,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.560
and to ask them to bless your Deities,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.520
or to ask them to awaken your Deities.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.920
So by doing the puja, means when you offer anything

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.000
that you have got to offer,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.480
anything that you offer is - say, flowers,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.720
if you want to offer flower to God,

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.400
you don't have to speak anything,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.560
you have to just offer, that "this is for You."

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.880
Anybody can understand offering,

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.760
for that you don't have to have even a tongue.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.440
Even if a blind man is there, if he wants to give you something,

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.480
he can just give you like this.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.960
And that expression is sufficient

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.640
for anybody to be convinced that he can offer it.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.160
You don't have to say anything about it.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.360
So now, when you offer a flower to God,

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.840
even if you don't say a mantra

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.080
it is offered - all right, it's given.

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.160
But whether it is accepted or not is a problem.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.600
But now, when you are a realized soul and you offer anything,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.080
it is acceptable to God even if you don't say anything.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.040
But what about you getting any reward out of it?

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:20.080
After realization when you offer anything to God, He accepts,

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.440
because it's coming from a realized soul, so He accepts.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.760
Now, how do we get

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.480
blessed by Him, by giving a flower to God?

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.480
Now if you don't say anything about it,

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.040
you just offer a flower,

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.280
then you might be rewarded with many flowers

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.920
automatically in life.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.720
Or you may be, whatever material things you offer,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.560
you may be blessed materially.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.240
Then in a subtler way if you say something,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.160
as you say for offering somebody

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.040
that humble way of saying that

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.720
"I'll be happy if You would accept this,"

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:21.880
will be even subtler results of that maybe,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.600
which could be much wider, maybe much deeper.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.200
Now, you do something symbolic

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.080
which is very, the essence, the principle of something.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.840
Like flowers are the -

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.480
they represent the principle of the Mother Earth.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.600
Now,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.640
so the symbolicism of all the things

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.720
that we can offer to God has been meditated upon,

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.280
and has been found out.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.600
So they use five things called as panchamruta,

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.960
as we have here.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.040
Because if you have hit the principle,

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.320
then you have really hit the whole, isn't it.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.280
Because spiritual well-being is a total well-being.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.080
It's not just partly that your material well-being

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.200
or your physical well-being, or your emotional well-being,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.840
or your mental well-being.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.480
It's a total one, completely balanced into totality.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:55.640
Now when you offer these other things like the,

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.480
we call them akshadas,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.960
what do you call ?

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.160
Turmeric. Turmeric rice, you see, this yellow thing, you see.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.600
When you offer this, you know, the yellow color

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.440
is that of the Swadisthana Chakra.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.160
And rice is very dear to all the gods.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.680
Now there's a trick in it, because it's a human trick.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.040
Gods are fond of rice.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.120
So they put turmeric on it,

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.640
means that "We offer to You a rice which is yellow-colored"

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:11.720
- means, "You should give us blessings of our creativity."

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.600
When you eat it, more creativity will flow

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.040
and we'll be blessed by that deity - it's a trick.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.480
The whole thing of puja is the trick of human saints, you see,

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.800
how to trick God to give more blessings!

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:41.080
But whatever God likes, it has to be auspicious and holy.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.760
So ultimately it works out for the

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:49.000
holiness of saints and their simple hearts.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.520
Now, the puja cannot be done by a person who is not a realized soul.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.560
A person who preaches also has to be a realized soul,

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.760
the one who does Namaz has to be a realized soul,

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.960
the one who prays has to be a realized soul.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.440
So all the utensils that are used are to be worshipped in a way

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.800
that they are to be holy things,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.720
they are to be respected things.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:40.400
You cannot use anything, say the one you are using in the bathroom

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.160
and you use the same thing for the puja, is absurd.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.400
Three things are very important,

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.560
is a ghatah, means [water pot] the vessel,

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.480
vessel that contains the kundalini,

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.000
the vessel that contains the

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.960
primordial desire within us to get to God,

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:36.600
is first to be worshipped, our desire.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.400
Is the ghatah, is the one made here.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.400
And on top is called as a Shriphala.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.120
Shriphala means this also has got water in it, if you  see,

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:52.160
the coconut represents the same thing.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.720
Now in the subtler form it is

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:58.560
the water of all the rivers of the world.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.960
And the coconut is the water of all the oceans.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.480
The water from the ocean or sea

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:47.000
rises through the tree-trunk of the coconut,

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.520
and becomes the sweet water in the coconut.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.400
It's a symbolic thing.

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.040
So this is the vessel called ghatah-puja, this is the ghatah-puja.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.320
Now, I don't want to go to details today,

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.240
because we have to talk about Ganesha.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.840
The same is - now that is water, all right.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:47.360
Then we have to worship Ghanta (bell) and Shankha (shell).

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:52.240
These are two representing the sound.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.360
Shell.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:30.120
Actually the Shankha represents the ether.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:43.120
Then we have the Deepa, means what?

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:49.160
It's the light, represents the light element, called as tejas.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.880
Normally also to the Goddess they also give Her a fan,

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.880
which represents the air element.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.360
So this is how all the five elements

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.080
are pleased beforehand, using them.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:42.040
So the essences of these or the causal essences

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.960
of these five elements

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:47.920
should be pleased at this time,

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:52.000
should be supporting the puja.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.320
Now there are also all kinds of other things,

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:20.280
like your family deities, you might be

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.640
worshipping in your family some deities.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:26.360
They should not be also at this time upsetting the puja;

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:29.480
or maybe the forefathers who are dead.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.840
All these things are to be quietened,

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:35.120
so that they should be told that this is a puja like this,

00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.560
and you do not disturb us at this time.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.720
Means even thoughts should not come,

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.160
their thoughts or their - any disturbances.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.160
So everything is to be first made into peace.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:09.160
Now this is the one aspect I have told you in short,

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.080
because it's a very long thing. If I have to speak about it

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.480
I'll have to speak at least three times,

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:19.920
and with three hours each time, still it may not be finished.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.760
Now we come to the second aspect,

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.160
which question I asked you "What do you,

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:14.480
how do you get benefited by it?"

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:45.760
So apart from this technique, to have the best

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.920
effect of the blessings

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:55.960
or the best flow of the Grace within us,

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.800
we say mantras.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.320
The sound of mantras,

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.760
the sound, the sound echo

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:30.120
into the being of God.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.520
And they are re-echoed on our chakras,

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.800
and then the chakras start opening more.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:04.680
So the flow of the Grace of God is received.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.240
But only a realized soul should chant a mantra.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.960
Because without connection, how will it reach God?

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.400
It is a vicious circle.

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.280
Now one may say that "Mother, you cannot get realization

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.120
unless and until you get the Grace of God.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.400
And the chakras won't open by a person

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.480
who is not a realized soul.

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:27.200
And without opening the chakras you cannot get realization."

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:39.640
That's how the play of the Mother comes in,

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:46.600
and of all the saints, like you.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:02.400
I would say the Sahaja yogis have to break this vicious circle.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:16.520
You have to raise the kundalini yourself.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.760
Once you raise the kundalini, the kundalini opens

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.880
the chakras a little bit,

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:40.800
because you have given your vibrations to the chakras.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.080
So once she knows there is a Sahaja yogi standing

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.760
behind the seeker, she rises.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.960
She knows you are her brothers and sisters,

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:26.120
and that you belong to the same family as she does.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.840
She knows the land where she has to grow, you see,

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:48.320
so she can feel that, and then she rises in her dignity.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.080
That's how she breaks this vicious circle.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:15.400
That's why in the beginning we don't tell them about the mantras,

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:26.120
because in the mantras you have to accept Me as the Deity.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:48.400
In this advent of Mine it is made compulsory

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.760
that you have to recognize Me.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:08.520
Because this is very precarious,

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.760
the Resurrection Time we can call it,

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:14.160
or the time of your Last Judgment.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:28.320
First the realization has to be given

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.600
without any recognition.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:49.360
But not to those who are denying or insulting Me.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.800
Under any circumstances they cannot get realization,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.320
whatever you may try.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:19.280
Even after realization if people start thinking against Me,

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.320
vibrations will stop,

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.960
because of Sahasrara.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.960
And the heart has to be

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.720
completely in unison with Me,

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.880
otherwise Sahasrara is closed.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.680
Now those people who are simple,

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:24.320
who are full of open heart, you see,

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.520
such people understand Me very well and

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.960
they just put Me in their hearts.

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.360
After realization,

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:53.680
after going through the understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:58.960
through their mental activity, also the intellectuals understand Me

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:04.160
and recognize Me in a little circuitous way.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:46.280
After the puja, when they receive the blessings,

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.640
a very blissful state they achieve,

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:55.560
then they realize the value of puja also - afterwards.

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.640
Now in India,

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.800
where the puja system has been traditionally coming

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.280
and has been maintained quite a lot,

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.560
they understand it without any mental processes.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.720
But when they meet somebody, an intellectual,

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.640
who has become a Sahaja yogi, you see

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.240
they can't understand them.

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.160
They don't want to listen about it,

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.920
the whole rigmarole of the whole movement of the brain.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.160
And some of them who try, you see, a little westernized,

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.640
they try, you see; they develop an inferiority complex,

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.120
and they go to the left side.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.800
But there is no need to understand it with mental,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.520
I mean, to all the time analyzing through your mental process,

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.040
and then to understand everything,

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:18.320
and then become Sahaja yogis with the heart open.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.480
This is rather very circuitous.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.440
But what to do? They have gone that way,

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.400
so they have to come that way.

00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:10.240
Because even if they become Sahaja yogis,

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.520
they start questioning and thinking about it,

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.360
and worrying about it.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.480
So the false people just mesmerize them

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.640
and take advantage of that mesmerism.

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:10.760
So one should not feel bad.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.200
If you feel like analyzing, you should go ahead with it,

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:19.240
because I cannot stop your speed,

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.120
I'm not going to mesmerize you.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:54.760
In Sahaja Yoga the freedom is to be respected.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:07.600
But we do not allow people to come for puja

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.720
who have not achieved a certain amount

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:16.600
of understanding mentally of Sahaja Yoga

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.960
- from the Western people, not in India,

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.760
but here there is a restriction.

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:03.040
Because supposing in India I do not explain to them,

00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.520
they don't want to know.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.720
They know that they'll get vibrations.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.560
They already know about vibrations,

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.640
so I don't have to tell them "You will get more vibrations."

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.360
If they get more vibrations they know I am the Shakti,

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.560
that's all, I don't have to explain it.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.440
Like as you can make out which is the best wine,

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.960
they can make out who is the real person.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:56.080
They know the taste of it.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.720
Now, once in a puja

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.720
I had about six thousand people that touched My Feet.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.760
So I said, "In a puja now, please don't have

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.760
- the people need not touch My Feet." I said it.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.600
But they thought it was Dhumal who suggested,

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.480
so they all got after his life.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.560
They said, "You only want to take all the blessings

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.120
from Mother's Feet, and you didn't want us to take it",

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.600
and they got after him.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:26.040
Another thing is, you see, in the West

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:30.760
I never used to make the panchamruta with My Feet but with My Hands,

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.520
because here people would think that

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.520
that's a dirty thing feet is,

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.960
and we should not have of the feet, you see.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.360
But actually the Feet are very powerful,

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.400
and they can never be dirty.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.720
Like the River Ganges has vibrations.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.520
If you have the water of Ganges

00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:37.440
you will see that it will never be dirtied.

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.360
On the contrary, whatever are inside that

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.800
because it's never sort of very kept clean,

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.720
whatever dirt has gone into it,

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.520
it settles down and doesn't dirty the thing at all.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:52.560
It's very clean water, all the time vibrating.

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:26.840
So one must understand whatever is pure,

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.600
which is responsible for purity,

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.200
which is the source of purity,

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.960
can cleanse any impurity. So how it can be impure?

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.880
But with the brain if you think it, it's so limited.

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.480
You cannot think of something which is just

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:03.680
the embodiment of purity.

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.920
This is the point we have come now,

00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:33.440
where I think I should talk about the Absolute.

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:42.440
That is Shri Ganesha.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.880
Today is His Puja.

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:49.440
It's a very great thing

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:55.080
that this Puja we are doing in Geneva in Switzerland.

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:23.280
Geneva is the right Heart, I think.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.320
The way it is against right Heart.

00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:00.920
Everybody's life is a tragedy, like Rama in Ayodhya.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.440
And that is why it is very important

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:20.160
that Shri Ganesha should be worshipped here.

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:36.760
Now Shri Ganesha, as you know,

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:40.880
is the embodiment of innocence.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:00.280
Now Ganesha's color is red or orangish.

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:04.120
Because the child, when it is conceived as a fetus,

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.240
the first color it sees is orange

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:12.640
of the red wall of the mother's womb, of the blood.

00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:41.520
In Sahaja Yoga, now you must have learnt

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:47.120
that every action has a reaction, which acts.

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:08.800
The color of the original,

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:12.960
we can say the primordial

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:18.560
Ganesha is just of the clay,

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:24.480
because He is made out of Mother Earth.

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:47.280
Now when the Gauri, the Mother of Ganesha created Him

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:51.840
to protect Her chastity while She was having Her bath,

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.320
She colored Him red, because everybody could see that

00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:59.240
there's somebody sitting there to protect Her.

00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:28.320
So when you see the red color around you as a fetus,

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.320
then you absorb that color,

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:34.560
and your Ganesha gets colored

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:37.520
with the red in the same beautiful manner.

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:41.880
Just it has a reaction of that getting red and it acts,

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.760
means red color of a Ganesha,

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:49.320
the one who has a red color of a Ganesha, frightens others.

00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:51.320
They know there is Ganesha sitting there,

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:53.360
a pure, chaste,  personality

00:52:53.560 --> 00:52:57.400
with all the fieriness of the Ganesha is there.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:57.480
Now this Ganesha when He is in a childhood,

00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:00.960
as you see, when the child is born,

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:04.520
the children are extremely

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:07.560
protective or fiery, you can say,

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:12.880
about anybody touching their innocence.

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:43.360
When they are absolutely young they are not even aware of it.

00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:46.040
But slightly, as soon as they start growing,

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:48.800
they become very aware and they don't like

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.640
their clothes to be taken out in the presence of others.

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:57.480
They become very shy of their innocence.

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.720
I mean, not shy, shyness is not -

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:03.640
in the sense of their nudity, very shy of their nudity,

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:07.160
so that their innocence should not be attacked.

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.040
If their innocence is not attacked and if they are pure,

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:54.720
if they see a nude woman they'll close their eyes.

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.880
They would not like to see a nude woman,

00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:02.160
or a nude man.

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.560
So this is an innate understanding,

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:35.760
an intuitive understanding that it is important

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:39.360
that they must preserve their innocence.

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:54.120
Now, what is the innocence within us?

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:56.600
What does it do to us?

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.840
As it is, already I've told you that it gives us wisdom.

00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:23.800
All kinds of stupidity we do with our ego;

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.520
as I was describing the president

00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:29.000
and so many others at that age

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:32.520
and at that height of their positions,

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:37.680
it is because the Ganesha is missing completely.

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:17.840
We went to Brighton where they have a beach,

00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:23.840
sort of a - beach where you can do nude things.

00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:27.720
And My maid, she is innocent, you see, we went there,

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:29.960
and she couldn't understand, you see.

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.840
She asked Me, "But why are they doing it?"

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:04.800
But as you will find that in the West it's hard to find

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.400
a really a wise person.

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:25.200
You can say that the people are over-educated

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:29.680
and they are very well-equipped with other understanding

00:59:29.880 --> 00:59:32.760
of the material side of life and all that.

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:35.760
But as far as the wisdom is concerned,

00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.960
one can get shocked the way they are. I mean,

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:41.120
just don't understand, what's the wisdom behind it?

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:14.880
Because all their wisdom has become nothing but sex.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.520
They always think of sex,

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:34.640
and they always want to understand all the nonsense of the sex.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.320
If you start thinking about your sex,

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:49.280
naturally your innocence will be destroyed right there.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:11.480
Because you cannot use your intelligence for sex.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.680
I don't understand the wisdom how you can rationalize sex.

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.320
This is such a spontaneous thing.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.840
And by thinking about it, are you going to enjoy it?

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.280
How can you?

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.920
It would be like saying that we can transform a flower

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.520
into a fruit by thinking.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.120
And the more serious thing is this way,

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.280
that supposing you say "I can"

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:27.760
- of course you can never think like, I hope so, that

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:32.360
you can transform a flower into a fruit, I hope so.

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:51.960
But some people can think that

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.240
"I can shift," say for example,

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:58.440
"this thing from here to here, with my mind I can shift it."

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.560
Or materialize things.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:27.080
So you know that you can do it, you believe that you can do it,

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.960
because some people have done it.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.840
But as Sahaja yogis you know it is done by bhoots,

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:34.040
by dead spirits, they do it for you,

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:38.040
because they are busybodies trying to help you.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:11.720
Now, same thing happens as far as sex is concerned.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:16.320
When you want to have sex through your intellectual pursuits,

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:19.640
you get only the bhoots to do that for you.

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:46.320
Because when you project too much of your mind,

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:49.560
then it goes into areas where you catch them.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.960
And they are sometimes very sly, sometimes depraved,

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:16.120
sometimes aggressive, all kinds of things you gather,

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:21.360
and the result is that the sex becomes a nonsense.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:02.200
So many depraved people

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.800
are satisfied once they attack you,

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.680
and you have either a very excited sex,

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.240
that even if you rape hundred women you are not satisfied,

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.600
or you'll have an impotency of the worst type.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.480
So I mean, you are always left dissatisfied.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:22.720
All such people when they die they also become the same bhoots,

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:27.720
waiting for some sex fellow to come around, and jump on him.

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:44.800
Innocent persons also may not have any sex activity

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.920
for many years, even after marriage,

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.760
because they are so innocent.

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.040
It could be so also with very childlike people.

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.560
But here it's a science which is taught from childhood

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.360
- just imagine. What is the need?

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:30.880
Do the animals have to learn anything from childhood,

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:33.960
about sex? They produce children too.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.800
(You have said?)

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:15.280
So the asceticism

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:19.880
is not what I am teaching.

01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:32.400
First, the innocence is protective and red,

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:41.600
say till the age of, at the most, fifty years.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:57.720
Then gradually, if the person is properly maturing,

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:01.720
not the stupid people but who are maturing properly,

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:07.120
after fifty it starts becoming orange.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.640
It becomes orange.

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:43.520
Means when you get married this process

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:45.760
of this redness goes away

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:50.600
and it becomes, starts becoming orange.

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.320
That means the protection part is over.

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:33.040
Means, before marriage the virginity has to be preserved.

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:36.760
Till you meet the person with whom you are to be married,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.720
that redness is the protection of that virginity.

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.160
Then, when you are married,

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:05.480
the protection part of it is not needed.

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:16.240
But it has to be only towards one person,

01:12:16.440 --> 01:12:18.840
that's your husband or wife.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.880
Then the proper maturity takes place,

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.680
and by the time you are about fifty years of age

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:45.760
it becomes orange - means there's detachment.

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:48.600
You don't feel like having any more sex life.

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.760
There's no need also.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.840
And then you develop a,

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:46.920
what you call a

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:52.440
proper matured innocence which is,

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:56.760
can be compared with a

01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:02.800
properly baked earthenware.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:36.760
So old age is the really the golden age,

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:42.400
where a person has got that wisdom

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:48.040
shining through the complete behavior of that person.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.920
But why - again, why to have this maturity,

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:18.680
why to have this innocence?

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.160
Again, because you are rational people,

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.600
so one can ask the question, why?

01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:53.640
Innocence is the way you really give fun to others,

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.760
create the fun part of it.

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:58.920
The fun is created only through innocence.

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.800
And innocence is the only way you can really

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.880
emit also the fun.

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:40.240
Imagine this world without any fun, what would happen?

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:54.480
But people are very much confused with the fun

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:56.440
and the pleasures.

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:16.600
The pleasure is nice to begin with,

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:19.040
and horrible to end with.

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.960
But fun is a treasure.

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:39.840
Anything that is full of fun you remember all your life,

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:45.200
you can tell others, it's such an embodiment of fun-creation.

01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:03.520
Yogi: There's no word in French for "fun"!

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:11.520
Can you imagine, this French language is diplomatic

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:17.560
- no word for "fun"!

01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.680
Like I'll give you a simple example

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:34.280
how these children create fun out of something.

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:38.080
They make everything into a fun, you see.

01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:19.600
And now, you see, even when they speak

01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:25.240
or they say things also they create such a fun out of it.

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:45.720
The other day My youngest grandchild,

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:49.960
that's Anupama - she's hardly now six years -

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:54.760
was playing and she went up to the top of the house somewhere,

01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:58.040
and then we heard a big thud, you see.

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:28.440
And My daughter, she's a very frantic mother,

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:31.640
always worried about her children's well-being.

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:56.520
Fun, eh?

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.920
And she couldn't even walk, you see,

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.200
her legs became heavy with worry,

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:27.880
and she was walking to find out what's coming down now.

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:46.760
So she shouted for the child and the child came running down,

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:48.320
she was quite all right.

01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.160
So she shouted at her, and she said,

01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:00.760
"What happened? Where did you go? Why did you go up?"

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:03.120
She just started shouting at her.

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.920
So this child looked at her, quite puzzled,

01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:30.480
and she waited for her to stop her shouting.

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:51.640
And she said very quietly,

01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:55.840
"I've not come all the way from Riadh here to die!"

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:20.440
So there are so many things which you write it down,

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.800
it's all fun, and natural fun

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.440
that they have out of everything.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.400
You see, we can have now here all the children who are here,

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:31.040
there's so many things you can write them down,

01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:32.920
how beautiful things they are doing,

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:36.800
and how there is a twinkle of a mischief in their eyes,

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:41.400
that they want to create a fun out of everything.

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:22.480
Fun is joy-giving, it gives you joy.

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:26.560
It's not just a sort of a coaxing in any way,

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:30.760
or a hurting in any way or anything sadistic in it,

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:35.600
but it's just a blossoming.

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.600
Yogi: Mother, do You think it's possible

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:54.080
if we don't translate any more,

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:55.960
because it takes too much time for that

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.880
I think so

01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.960
Yogi: English words, we'll tell them at the end,

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.840
also the few who don't understand English,

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:03.680
we'll explain them at the end, what You have said.

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:06.960
All right for you? Because I'm coming to an end, Gregoire,

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:10.120
as I finish at twelve-thirty, so let's do it for today.

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.680
But the next time I think it's a better idea

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:15.240
to translate it later.

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:18.360
Just little bit I'll translate more, because we are coming

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.240
to an end, and that's why it's taken so much time, otherwise

01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:22.840
it will be one-third of the time.

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:26.160
Yes, just translate this part what I've said is,

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:28.960
that fun is nothing but blossoming.

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:43.480
It doesn't tease anyone, it doesn't hurt anyone,

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:47.320
doesn't trouble anyone but just blossoms,

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:50.520
the whole thing, into fragrance.

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:15.120
It is the Divine's trick.

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:24.200
It has something higher than that also,

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:27.200
that if you are innocent,

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:30.320
you really can feel the joy.

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:50.080
So an innocent person can feel the joy

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:53.360
of something which a very serious

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:56.960
and a very rational person may never see.

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:11.600
An innocent person may laugh loudly at a thing,

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:14.720
to other people it may not be something funny.

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:49.120
So the fun-creation is not a dubious thing,

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.760
it's a very straightforward, simple,

01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:55.960
a spontaneous blossoming.

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:27.360
Now in Geneva, people are really very serious about everything.

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:40.680
More so in Switzerland.

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:51.440
So much so that they commit suicide as a result.

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:03.560
Because you are money-oriented,

01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:13.200
and you are also a sort of a,

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:19.360
take up a role of helping the whole world.

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:36.880
Means you are very ego-oriented,

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:39.960
because you want to help the whole world. Who are you to help?

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.160
And thirdly, you have a stupid military here

01:30:05.360 --> 01:30:07.440
which is not needed at all.

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:20.240
Yogini: Mother, excuse me,

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:23.520
You know that yesterday it was in the newspapers

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:26.760
that there had been again a military airplane

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:30.040
which crashed in Switzerland, with two deaths.

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:33.240
With Your photo next to it.

01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.040
It's too much to blame Me!

01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:58.520
Yogini: He says, it was during a show

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:01.920
where they wanted to show off all the military strength.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.280
That's the fun

01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:12.400
- that's the fun, you see?

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.480
So everybody is happy about it, you see,

01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:18.000
that this is the one how you see is funny.

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:31.280
Now to help the fun more, we have got Hanumana.

01:31:34.400 --> 01:31:39.480
He helps the fun part of Shri Ganesh.

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.880
Like a,

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:07.720
like Ganesha who plays tricks

01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:10.960
of fun on the people who are left-sided,

01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:14.800
He plays His tricks on the right-sided people.

01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:49.560
Like there is a person who was crying too much,

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:53.360
her husband is dead, "Now what to do? I am finished,"

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:55.040
this thing, that thing, you see

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:58.880
- and suddenly she sees her husband walking in the room!

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:38.720
But this only He does to the people who are innocent.

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:56.120
But to the cunning, He punishes.

01:34:02.840 --> 01:34:05.240
He'll go on pouring all kinds of miseries,

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.920
one more than the other, and He'll say,

01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:09.600
"Now cry more, and cry more. You want to cry?

01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:12.720
All right, have it more, and have it more."

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:38.200
And Hanumana on His side -  say for example,

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:42.760
when Lakshmana was sick and He had to get some medicine

01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:47.000
from one big mountain,

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.720
He brought the whole mountain, you see.

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:53.560
Because He said, "I had no time to find it, you see,

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:56.680
so better find it now," and brought the whole mountain.

01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.440
He too is the same style,

01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:02.640
can be very destructive

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:05.720
when it comes to egoistical people,

01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:09.160
like Ravana - whole Lanka he burnt.

01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:50.320
If Ganesha is painted red, He is painted orange.

01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:06.320
And as Ganesha has to settle down permanently in one place,

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:11.360
He uses Saint Michael to run up and down the left side.

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.960
While Hanumana can run up and down,

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:16.960
He need not settle down at a place.

01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:02.120
But though He is a settled Deity, Sthita,

01:38:02.320 --> 01:38:04.240
is the one who is to be settled

01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:07.600
- once He's settled, then He emits vibrations

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:10.920
which go everywhere.

01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:31.320
He is the source of innocence.

01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:38.520
He is the source of the vibrations.

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:45.120
He is everything, in a way.

01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:54.360
When He ascends here as Mahaganesha within you,

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:58.240
and in God He descends as Ganesha

01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:01.560
- from here, on the back.

01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:57.240
So when you think too much about sex,

01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:03.640
your eyes get ruined, because you are using Mahaganesha.

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:15.720
Your Mahaganesha is spoilt,

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:20.880
and your eyes starts wobbling.

01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:49.960
The eyes lose innocence, purity,

01:40:56.600 --> 01:41:00.840
and they start absorbing all that is filth.

01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:14.880
The eyes which are pure and innocent

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:18.080
give innocence to others.

01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:34.080
Not only that, but they are the eyes,

01:41:34.320 --> 01:41:39.120
are the eyes through which the spirit looks out.

01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:01.120
It has many combinations which I have no time to tell you,

01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:03.440
but it's a very bad thing

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:06.600
that people get those unclean eyes, the bhootish eyes.

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:09.040
And anybody who is bhootish around

01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:11.360
will turn their eyes to that person,

01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:14.200
because it's a play of the satanic now playing now,

01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:16.120
the negative.

01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:02.840
And that is what we do when

01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:06.680
we do not place Ganesha at right places.

01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:21.840
If we have to make Ganesha reflected

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:25.400
in our Mahaganesha stage at this point,

01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:29.080
we should try to keep our eyes very clean,

01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:58.280
so that you keep the seat of Mahaganesha clean.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:14.440
In the Puja of Shri Ganesh

01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:18.200
you must bring the soft grass also,

01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:21.640
because durva, He's fond of Durva,

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:25.840
durva, that's called as durva- because the soft grass

01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:29.680
is soothing to the eyes.

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:35.480
Not only that, but it gives you the green part

01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:38.080
of the Swadisthana Chakra.

01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:43.920
Which -  he exists when we have not started about thinking,

01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:47.400
you have not started the thinking process.

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:50.400
That suggests that part of Swadisthana,

01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:52.640
when you are not thinking,

01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:57.520
the green part of it, the lower part of the Swadisthana is green.

01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:46.280
So the green is the one:

01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:49.280
at that stage we have not become human beings,

01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:52.760
at that stage it represents the green of Swadisthana,

01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:55.280
where it created the whole universe, everything.

01:45:55.480 --> 01:45:56.920
Up to that it's green.

01:45:57.120 --> 01:45:59.240
Then when it starts creating the ego

01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:02.880
it becomes the yellow color, where it uses the sun,

01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:05.360
the action part.

01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:14.120
Not "uses" the sun but becomes active,

01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:16.440
representing the sun side.

01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:01.440
So the green represents actually the part of

01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.760
Ganesha, part of Ganesha in a way,

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:08.240
because till then you are not thinking.

01:47:08.440 --> 01:47:09.560
You are at a level

01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:12.040
where you are close to the Mother Earth, you see.

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:14.120
So the Mother Earth is giving, you see.

01:47:14.320 --> 01:47:17.640
The sun part has not started when the green is there,

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:19.960
because the Mother Earth gives this green.

01:47:20.160 --> 01:47:22.840
Of course the sun makes it green, that's different point,

01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:25.200
but that you don't start doing it.

01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:28.760
When you start doing something yourself at a human level,

01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:30.920
the whole thing becomes yellow.

01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:32.760
So Swadisthana has two sides,

01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:35.080
the physical and the mental side.

01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:36.960
The physical side is the green side,

01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:40.720
and the mental side is the yellow side.

01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:07.640
So now we are today here to worship Shri Ganesh.

01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:12.720
Now I would like you to get some grass from the yard

01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:16.280
some soft grass, because that's an important part of it.

01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:27.880
So you should put your eyes onto the greenery

01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:32.400
to improve your Ganesha.

01:49:57.640 --> 01:49:59.360
And when  it is very warm,

01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:03.160
then you can also walk barefoot on the green

01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:06.520
in the morning-time, when the dew is on it.

01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:35.040
Those who are very overactive

01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:37.160
should take to the vegetarian diet,

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:42.960
it will help them to become more towards the balanced side.

01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:47.120
Not as a fanaticism, but more on vegetables,

01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:50.520
and eat animals which are very small ones,

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:52.520
so it's all right.
