00:07.049 --> 00:08.049
Shri Ganesha Puja
Canberra, Australia

00:08.049 --> 00:09.049
April 14, 1991

00:09.049 --> 00:11.670
This will be the fifth puja in Australia,
and I thought that this is the land of Ganesha,

00:11.670 --> 00:12.690
we should have the Ganesha Puja.

00:12.690 --> 00:13.719
Is very important also, very helpful.

00:13.719 --> 00:15.250
We all should have Ganesha Puja, it’s very
important.

00:15.250 --> 00:16.789
And so today there will be Shri Ganesha Puja.

00:16.789 --> 00:17.906
Have you got the hundred and eight names of
Shri Ganesha?

00:17.906 --> 00:18.906
So we have now requested John Fisher to be
your leader in Canberra.

00:18.906 --> 00:19.906
And he has agreed.

00:19.906 --> 00:26.970
I don’t know what to tell you more about
Shri Ganesh, because really it is so important

00:26.970 --> 00:34.720
that we have to know the importance of Mooladhara
Chakra.

00:34.720 --> 00:50.190
If you read the newspaper, just on the first
page you find people going amok as far as

00:50.190 --> 00:58.070
their moral sense is concerned, absolutely
I mean, to us it is something so shocking,

00:58.070 --> 01:02.432
and perhaps I think people are possessed on
their Mooladhara Chakra.

01:02.432 --> 01:12.300
The way they behave one feels that there’s
something gone wrong with them completely

01:12.300 --> 01:21.830
and they have no control over themselves;
and just like mad people they are behaving.

01:21.830 --> 01:28.070
And all these problems that are coming, of
these perversions, are due to this kind of

01:28.070 --> 01:32.260
a possession on the Mooladhara Chakra.

01:32.260 --> 01:38.500
One has to be very, very careful and respectful
about it.

01:38.500 --> 01:44.090
I have already told so many things how to
keep it clean, how to respect it and how to

01:44.090 --> 01:49.500
behave yourself.

01:49.500 --> 02:01.500
As you know, Shri Ganesha was created
at the gate of hell to protect us from falling

02:01.500 --> 02:03.880
into hell.

02:03.880 --> 02:15.610
But actually when we insult Him and we do
not care for Him, He just sleeps off.

02:15.610 --> 02:26.780
When that happens, any kind of a possession
can come and can really make people mad.

02:26.780 --> 02:36.120
When you come from India to these places you
are really surprised and shocked.

02:36.120 --> 02:42.120
What is wrong with these people, how can they
be behaving in this manner?

02:42.120 --> 02:48.319
How can they go all out to ruin themselves
like this?

02:48.319 --> 02:55.790
And how is it they do not understand the importance
of morality when they are following Christ?

02:55.790 --> 03:02.760
The Christians, I think, are the worst as
far as morality is concerned.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.190
They have no moral values left in them.

03:05.190 --> 03:13.319
It’s such a sad thing that the number of
people killed by Christians is also the maximum.

03:13.319 --> 03:20.690
Sometimes I think these people who were killed
everywhere might have possessed the Christians

03:20.690 --> 03:27.959
this way, that they are just going amok and
behaving in this manner, destroying themselves.

03:27.959 --> 03:37.290
Now the first quality of Shri Ganesha is that
He gives us wisdom.

03:37.290 --> 03:44.459
And that wisdom gives us the sense how to
behave, gives us the balance, and gives us

03:44.459 --> 03:55.540
the sense how to behave towards ourselves,
how to preserve yourself, how to respect yourself.

03:55.540 --> 04:07.410
But if Ganesha is not at all there to watch
you, might be from hell some horrible hellish

04:07.410 --> 04:12.050
bhoots are coming out, or I don’t know,
I cannot explain this kind of a thing.

04:12.050 --> 04:18.630
But the other way round, I’ll tell you,
in India, is specially with women, they are

04:18.630 --> 04:26.129
extremely particular about their chastity,
extremely particular.

04:26.129 --> 04:34.030
Like we had a queen called Padmini, and she
was a very beautiful woman.

04:34.030 --> 04:40.410
And one Muslim aggressor who became sultan
heard about her beauty.

04:40.410 --> 04:44.590
So he wanted to see her.

04:44.590 --> 04:48.270
So she refused, “I don’t want to see him.”

04:48.270 --> 04:58.309
Even seeing a woman like that: those bad eyes,
are bad; seeing a woman also, are bad.

04:58.309 --> 05:04.650
So he said, “If you do not allow me to see
her, I’ll invade your country.”

05:04.650 --> 05:10.729
So she agreed that, “All right, he can see
me in a mirror, so at least his bad eyes don’t

05:10.729 --> 05:12.300
fall on me directly.”

05:12.300 --> 05:13.400
She agreed to that.

05:13.400 --> 05:22.199
And he saw her in a mirror, and he saw that
it was even more beautiful than he had thought

05:22.199 --> 05:23.360
her to be.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.599
So now he wanted to have her.

05:25.599 --> 05:29.660
So physical, so superficial.

05:29.660 --> 05:36.139
And he said, “If you now do not come to
me, I will again attack.”

05:36.139 --> 05:42.780
So they made a plan, “Let us now decide
whether we are going to surrender our queen

05:42.780 --> 05:43.780
or not.”

05:43.780 --> 05:44.780
So everybody said, “Nothing doing.

05:44.780 --> 05:46.490
We are not going to surrender.”

05:46.490 --> 05:56.650
Because the chastity of a woman is very important,
and that of a queen, and a queen, who is representative

05:56.650 --> 06:01.569
of all the womanhood should not be sacrificed
like this.

06:01.569 --> 06:04.479
They could not bear the idea.

06:04.479 --> 06:11.629
So they said that, “All right, we’ll organize
something and cheat these people.”

06:11.629 --> 06:16.159
So they sent a word, “All right, we are
all coming and the queen is coming too.”

06:16.159 --> 06:17.879
And they sent hundred palanquins.

06:17.879 --> 06:22.460
We use palanquins for ladies in India, covered.

06:22.460 --> 06:28.569
And inside every palanquin there was one warrior
sitting with all the weapons.

06:28.569 --> 06:33.830
And there were four carrying the palanquin,
and all these four were also warriors.

06:33.830 --> 06:38.129
So thus they have about five hundred warriors.

06:38.129 --> 06:42.180
It was a small kingdom.

06:42.180 --> 06:46.520
So when they went down, these people were
very happy.

06:46.520 --> 06:47.520
“The queen is coming.”

06:47.520 --> 06:52.020
and they were all getting drunk and celebrating
it.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.409
“The queen is coming.

06:53.409 --> 06:54.409
Queen is coming.”

06:54.409 --> 06:56.029
So they were half drunk also.

06:56.029 --> 07:02.339
They had told these women that, “In case
we win, then we lit a fire and you will know

07:02.339 --> 07:04.440
that we have won.

07:04.440 --> 07:11.639
But if you do not see any thing like that,
then be sure that we have lost the war.”

07:11.639 --> 07:17.080
So the king sat in the front palanquin, and
the rest of them, and they went and attacked

07:17.080 --> 07:22.149
them in the sense that they first entered
inside, and then instead of the queen, the

07:22.149 --> 07:25.749
king came out and they all fought those people.

07:25.749 --> 07:30.830
But they were only five hundred so they could
not be saved, and these people had better

07:30.830 --> 07:33.770
weapons, so they were killed.

07:33.770 --> 07:36.300
They did not lit the fire.

07:36.300 --> 07:38.559
Now the women knew that all of them will be
coming.

07:38.559 --> 07:44.149
Now they were very rich sultans, very rich
Muslims, and things like that.

07:44.149 --> 07:50.889
But they thought that now their chastity is
in danger, so there was a big platform and

07:50.889 --> 07:52.499
they made a big pyre on that.

07:52.499 --> 08:03.129
And they all entered into it and killed themselves,
before they could enter and touch their body.

08:03.129 --> 08:10.599
So for women specially it is very important
to have a great sense of chastity.

08:10.599 --> 08:16.729
And if they do not have the great sense of
chastity, then they develop all kinds of funny

08:16.729 --> 08:21.939
ideas and mentally they become very imbalanced.

08:21.939 --> 08:28.080
And the children that they have, also become
very funny and you have all these problems

08:28.080 --> 08:31.789
of perverted relations, incest relations.

08:31.789 --> 08:38.550
And today I read a horrible story about a
little girl who suffered with this incest

08:38.550 --> 08:41.010
relationship.

08:41.010 --> 08:48.120
It’s hell that we have created.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.290
In hell what else is going to be?

08:50.290 --> 08:52.090
Same thing.

08:52.090 --> 09:00.100
There’s no sanity about it, there’s no
wisdom about it.

09:00.100 --> 09:09.180
So we have to now understand how we have to
build ourselves as Sahaja yogis.

09:09.180 --> 09:15.839
Men and women, all of them, have to go hand
in hand, because the first quality I told

09:15.839 --> 09:20.970
is wisdom, but the essence of Mooladhara is
innocence.

09:20.970 --> 09:25.510
They are made of innocence.

09:25.510 --> 09:28.600
The power of Ganesha is innocence.

09:28.600 --> 09:34.579
And innocence comes when you do not destroy
it.

09:34.579 --> 09:40.680
Actually a child is born innocent, but if
the mother is like that, immediately the child

09:40.680 --> 09:46.769
takes over and if the father is like that
the son takes over.

09:46.769 --> 09:51.300
But later on it has effect, whether it’s
mother or father.

09:51.300 --> 09:56.529
The whole society is decadent, is in decadence,
is going down.

09:56.529 --> 09:58.940
You can see it so clearly.

09:58.940 --> 10:09.220
Thanks to certain great saints in India who
made the culture of India, it has not come

10:09.220 --> 10:16.519
from any philosophers or any writers or intellectuals,
but it has come to us from the saints who

10:16.519 --> 10:25.399
understood the value of chastity, and who
understood the value of innocence.

10:25.399 --> 10:30.990
And they have built the whole thing in such
a manner that these things never enter into

10:30.990 --> 10:31.990
our head.

10:31.990 --> 10:36.860
So we call them as susamskaras, means “good
conditionings”.

10:36.860 --> 10:42.160
These good conditionings are surrounding us
so much that this never enters into our head,

10:42.160 --> 10:46.470
all these kind of things that people are doing
here, are mad.

10:46.470 --> 10:58.430
When it doesn’t enter into your head, we
can say that we just do not allow these possessions

10:58.430 --> 11:01.279
to come in.

11:01.279 --> 11:08.269
Because if you make preparation in a way for
these possessions to come in, then the possessions

11:08.269 --> 11:09.329
will be there.

11:09.329 --> 11:15.339
Like the way people dress up nowadays, you
see, they look like really witches or bhoots,

11:15.339 --> 11:16.440
absolutely.

11:16.440 --> 11:21.519
And such people will be definitely attacked,
because the bhoots think that, “These are

11:21.519 --> 11:22.530
someone like us.

11:22.530 --> 11:24.670
Let’s go enter them.”

11:24.670 --> 11:26.430
Also Agnya is not to be covered.

11:26.430 --> 11:31.709
I have told a hundred times, please don’t
cover your Agnya, please clear it down.

11:31.709 --> 11:33.480
Don’t cover your Agnya.

11:33.480 --> 11:38.250
If you cover your Agnya, then you cannot be
protected.

11:38.250 --> 11:43.860
They enter into your Agnya and from Agnya
they can go up to your Mooladhara.

11:43.860 --> 11:50.820
So you are living in atmosphere which is very
dangerous for saints to live.

11:50.820 --> 11:54.470
Actually that’s why they said the saints
must go to Himalaya.

11:54.470 --> 12:01.500
If they could say that to Indians, I don’t
know what should I say to people who live

12:01.500 --> 12:04.700
in such horrible circumstance, absolutely
horrible.

12:04.700 --> 12:12.671
I mean, you think about it, how terrible it
is, and how many problems it gives us; how

12:12.671 --> 12:20.660
many people are ruined, how many children
are ruined, how we go amok.

12:20.660 --> 12:29.670
So the first thing is that we should understand
that Ganesha gives us maryadas, limits, it

12:29.670 --> 12:32.860
is innate within us.

12:32.860 --> 12:37.480
It’s not imposed on us, it is innate.

12:37.480 --> 12:42.949
A little girl if you see, she’s shy, she
knows how to protect herself.

12:42.949 --> 12:53.110
Even the boys, they are shy and they try to
protect themselves, but that innate innocence

12:53.110 --> 12:58.620
we try to flout, because ego is there.

12:58.620 --> 12:59.819
“What’s wrong?”

12:59.819 --> 13:03.420
You tell them anything, “What’s wrong?”

13:03.420 --> 13:08.379
And you do not know how devastating it is.

13:08.379 --> 13:14.579
In London I know of so many parents telling
Me that their children are already squatting,

13:14.579 --> 13:17.319
they have got already children.

13:17.319 --> 13:28.279
At a very young age, about fifteen, sixteen
they

13:28.279 --> 13:29.279
have got children.

13:29.279 --> 13:33.300
And this is so widespread, and so shamelessly
they discuss.

13:33.300 --> 13:37.639
I mean, in the newspaper if you read, I mean
you can’t imagine why to write all these

13:37.639 --> 13:39.990
things in such details in the newspaper.

13:39.990 --> 13:45.790
There’s no need to write each and every
thing in the newspaper.

13:45.790 --> 13:50.519
But basically we are good people.

13:50.519 --> 13:54.930
God has created us good human beings.

13:54.930 --> 14:09.079
We are beautiful people, but this ego and
this kind of a stupid idea that, “What’s

14:09.079 --> 14:15.209
wrong?” in doing anything, coming from ego;
people have gone amok, and when you go amok

14:15.209 --> 14:20.499
you get caught up by these bhoots, and then
once you are caught up by these bhoots, you

14:20.499 --> 14:24.579
start behaving in a manner that no one can
explain.

14:24.579 --> 14:27.120
“Why they behave like this?”

14:27.120 --> 14:30.300
I just don’t understand.

14:30.300 --> 14:37.610
There was a boy who came with all his hair
not properly done and looking funny and with

14:37.610 --> 14:39.320
all these jattas, as we call them.

14:39.320 --> 14:42.010
So I asked him, “Why do you dress up like
this?

14:42.010 --> 14:43.959
You look like a primitive man.”

14:43.959 --> 14:46.259
He said, “I want to be primitive.”

14:46.259 --> 14:48.209
I said, “You cannot.

14:48.209 --> 14:49.860
Your brain is modern.

14:49.860 --> 14:53.649
By just making such hair, are you going to
become primitive?

14:53.649 --> 14:56.269
You cannot become primitive.”

14:56.269 --> 15:00.250
But just imagine, all these external things
they do.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.300
For what?

15:01.300 --> 15:03.930
To have an identity.

15:03.930 --> 15:11.310
Now this idea of identity is also is a sign
that you do not have your maryadas.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.310
You can do anything.

15:12.310 --> 15:15.550
You can become a punk and all kinds of things
you do.

15:15.550 --> 15:18.310
I mean, there are no maryadas.

15:18.310 --> 15:21.430
And that means you are denying Ganesha completely.

15:21.430 --> 15:29.380
Ganesha has created those maryadas innately
within us.

15:29.380 --> 15:34.550
Even a prostitute in India, if she has to
take to that profession because she’s forced

15:34.550 --> 15:40.430
into it, maybe she’s been brought from somewhere
or maybe that out of her big problems she

15:40.430 --> 15:45.720
might have been a prostitute; she will see
that her child is saved.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.139
She knows that it’s wrong.

15:47.139 --> 15:51.449
But here it is so bad that we do not know
also that it is wrong.

15:51.449 --> 15:57.410
Can you imagine, this is the limit of things,
that you see yourself getting drowned in the

15:57.410 --> 16:00.529
water and you know that you are going to be
killed.

16:00.529 --> 16:04.189
Still you are enjoying, “Very nice, I am
going to be killed.”

16:04.189 --> 16:06.999
This is the situation of the wisdom.

16:06.999 --> 16:09.899
This is really shocking.

16:09.899 --> 16:15.200
So we have to now understand what are our
maryadas are, how we have to live within our

16:15.200 --> 16:21.149
maryadas, and I’m sure if you really work
out your Shri Ganesha.

16:21.149 --> 16:24.519
For that the best is to meditate.

16:24.519 --> 16:32.069
Put yourself on some nice turf, grass.

16:32.069 --> 16:33.069
Sit on that.

16:33.069 --> 16:40.839
Put your left hand with the light, and right
hand on the Mother Earth, and say Atharva

16:40.839 --> 16:41.910
Sheersha.

16:41.910 --> 16:44.499
If you can remember it by heart, it’s a
very good thing.

16:44.499 --> 16:50.610
Otherwise, you can keep the book and read
it, or say Ganesha’s mantra to begin with.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.809
It’s going to help you very much.

16:52.809 --> 16:57.839
It’s going to help you, your eyes, it’s
going to your whole thing, is going to be

16:57.839 --> 16:59.809
very nice.

16:59.809 --> 17:07.470
And also with this kind of a mad Mooladhara,
a woman can become extremely aggressive with

17:07.470 --> 17:08.470
her husband.

17:08.470 --> 17:13.400
I mean, she can be a very cruel woman, and
that’s what is happening in America now.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.880
But I can’t understand how women could be
that cruel.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.770
I mean, I never used to think women could
be cruel, really.

17:19.770 --> 17:30.560
I mean they could be sly, they could be sort
of, doing some scandal-mongering or some sort

17:30.560 --> 17:33.710
of stupid things like that.

17:33.710 --> 17:39.660
But that a woman should be a cruel woman…
when I first read the history of England I

17:39.660 --> 17:45.430
was surprised that there were some queens
who were very cruel, and also that there were

17:45.430 --> 17:47.760
seven queens who were killed.

17:47.760 --> 18:09.920
In India if a king kills even one queen, he’ll
be ousted completely from the whole country.

18:09.920 --> 18:54.030
So it’s not a

18:54.030 --> 18:55.910
something very simple thing.

18:55.910 --> 18:57.600
It’s very serious.

18:57.600 --> 19:02.720
For Sahaja yogis very, very serious.

19:02.720 --> 19:09.470
They have to revive their innocence.

19:09.470 --> 19:13.780
They have to revive their maryadas.

19:13.780 --> 19:15.830
They have to delimit themselves.

19:15.830 --> 19:18.370
It’s very important.

19:18.370 --> 19:26.420
Otherwise, I would say that, if you have some
wheat spread out everywhere, how can you reach

19:26.420 --> 19:27.930
the heights?

19:27.930 --> 19:31.590
You have to put them into some bags, some
maryadas.

19:31.590 --> 19:37.590
Only by maryadas you can rise.

19:37.590 --> 19:40.100
Of course the kundalini will help.

19:40.100 --> 19:42.520
Of course Ganesha will help also.

19:42.520 --> 19:46.720
But we should also try to watch ourselves.

19:46.720 --> 19:52.920
There should be introspection, “Are we still
in the same category?”

19:52.920 --> 20:01.240
I have told many people that it is better
you walk with your eyes towards the grass,

20:01.240 --> 20:06.480
at only at three feet, because at three feet
you can only see children, flowers and grounds,

20:06.480 --> 20:09.040
not higher than that.

20:09.040 --> 20:12.710
Nothing very beautiful is beyond that I think.

20:12.710 --> 20:26.430
Or raise much higher, so that you just see
above the heads of people, nothing in between.

20:26.430 --> 20:33.100
And our whole style, lifestyle is so funny;
I mean, I just don’t know how to explain

20:33.100 --> 20:36.620
it, but is accepted.

20:36.620 --> 20:44.050
Yesterday there was an Indian, and very seriously
he came and told Me, “I have been committing

20:44.050 --> 20:46.130
one sin, so I must tell you.”

20:46.130 --> 20:47.130
I said, “What?”

20:47.130 --> 20:51.050
“In my family nobody takes beer, but I am
taking beer sometimes.”

20:51.050 --> 20:57.780
After that, I didn’t know where to look
and what to say.

20:57.780 --> 21:06.190
Very seriously he said, “You are Mother,
so I must confess to You, but now I will never

21:06.190 --> 21:07.760
touch beer.”

21:07.760 --> 21:08.760
Imagine.

21:08.760 --> 21:14.840
Very seriously he was talking, and another
fellow came, he has told Me.

21:14.840 --> 21:18.610
I said, “Now you Indians don’t want to
come to this thing.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.610
What is it?

21:19.610 --> 21:20.820
You are all making money?”

21:20.820 --> 21:25.310
He said, “We have made a lot of money here
and we don’t want any money.”

21:25.310 --> 21:27.440
But I said, “Then why don’t you come?

21:27.440 --> 21:30.350
You should come and take your, to Sahaja Yoga.

21:30.350 --> 21:31.350
Why not?”

21:31.350 --> 21:35.480
He said, “You see, Mother, mostly the trouble
is…”

21:35.480 --> 21:39.670
With very great hesitation, he said that,
“You see, mostly it is not advertised in

21:39.670 --> 21:45.050
Indian papers, and we Indians think that we
are rather of a different species, you see,

21:45.050 --> 21:50.220
how are we going to fit in with these people
because, you see, their ideas are so different,

21:50.220 --> 21:54.520
ours are so different, and how are we going
to fit in with them?

21:54.520 --> 21:56.550
It’s very difficult.

21:56.550 --> 22:01.400
But this time I saw some Indians also and
some Indian musicians singing, so it seems

22:01.400 --> 22:04.080
that we can fit into them.”

22:04.080 --> 22:07.560
“Yes,” I said, “They can fit in to you
and you can fit in to them.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.560
It’s easy.

22:08.560 --> 22:09.560
They are your style only.”

22:09.560 --> 22:14.350
He said, “We were really enamored how they
were nice, you see, and they were.”

22:14.350 --> 22:18.610
Because they do not consider that these things
are bad or anything.

22:18.610 --> 22:20.010
India is like that, you see.

22:20.010 --> 22:23.740
They think you are of a different bottle and
they are of a different bottle.

22:23.740 --> 22:26.920
So you are like that and they are like that.

22:26.920 --> 22:32.110
They cannot be like you and you cannot be
like them, so they think it is a different

22:32.110 --> 22:35.730
bottle you belong to, you see, different category
of people.

22:35.730 --> 22:39.880
But they don’t think that you are bad or
good, they don’t pass judgment.

22:39.880 --> 22:46.260
But this is what it is, that we have to understand
that we have gone too far with this madness,

22:46.260 --> 22:48.830
spoiling our Shri Ganesha.

22:48.830 --> 22:57.990
Also Australians have to give a very big lead
in Shri Ganesha’s area because you are sitting

22:57.990 --> 23:02.380
on the soil of Shri Ganesha.

23:02.380 --> 23:05.080
To all the Sahaja yogis, you must show.

23:05.080 --> 23:11.880
But, as you know what, we had horrible experiences
so far, and how people have been dominating

23:11.880 --> 23:22.030
and doing all kinds of nonsensical things,
money-wise and otherwise also morality-wise.

23:22.030 --> 23:30.950
So it sometimes upsets the whole balance of
Sahaja Yoga because it’s all depending on

23:30.950 --> 23:37.270
Shri Ganesha; that means depending on Australians.

23:37.270 --> 23:45.530
And Australians have all the possibility of
reaching a great height in Ganesh principle,

23:45.530 --> 23:49.280
because they have the Mother Earth here sitting
down.

23:49.280 --> 23:52.370
What else do they want?

23:52.370 --> 23:55.970
You need not take to stupid American-style
things.

23:55.970 --> 24:01.510
I mean, if you see their Hallowe’en, I tell
you, you won’t eat your food for eight days.

24:01.510 --> 24:08.100
And if you go only to Rio, even you do not
visit their carnivals, but even if you see

24:08.100 --> 24:13.200
the pictures, you won’t eat your food for
one month, so horrible they are.

24:13.200 --> 24:23.440
So are we going to follow them, or are we
going to start our own Australian Shri Ganesha’s

24:23.440 --> 24:25.980
special people?

24:25.980 --> 24:37.890
Or, this I have to warn you, and people are
all watching all over, all Sahaja yogis are

24:37.890 --> 24:41.290
there; you know that all over the world we
have Sahaja yogis.

24:41.290 --> 24:48.520
They’re watching everyone, and you have
to do your maximum to express your Ganesh

24:48.520 --> 24:53.650
principle, which should be very easy for you.

24:53.650 --> 24:58.320
And as I have told you, that Australia was
a part and parcel of India once upon a time.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.870
It has come down here.

25:00.870 --> 25:06.570
So, at least in your films and all that, you
can say they’re dharmic, they are dharmic.

25:06.570 --> 25:15.080
They’re not so bad as the American films
are, but still this idea of copying the French

25:15.080 --> 25:19.490
or the Americans shows that we have lost our
personality.

25:19.490 --> 25:23.540
But Shri Ganesha gives you a personality.

25:23.540 --> 25:27.340
He gives you your personality, because He
gives you maryadas.

25:27.340 --> 25:30.420
You see, by maryadas only, you get your personality.

25:30.420 --> 25:33.450
A person is known by his maryadas.

25:33.450 --> 25:37.910
And that’s what has to come within us, are
our maryadas.

25:37.910 --> 25:40.950
So today’s puja is about Shri Ganesha.

25:40.950 --> 25:46.360
As of course you know, He has got four petals
and you know what He is placed in and what

25:46.360 --> 25:51.490
He does and all that, and how He looks after
the chastity of His Mother and all that.

25:51.490 --> 25:58.370
But the main thing is that how we develop
Shri Ganesha within us, how people see us

25:58.370 --> 26:03.820
as the incarnations of innocence on this Earth.

26:03.820 --> 26:11.990
I know it’s very difficult, but imagine
Shri Ganesha sitting on the gate of hell,

26:11.990 --> 26:19.020
of excretion, because He’s just like a lotus,
above everything else, and He makes everything

26:19.020 --> 26:20.060
fragrant.

26:20.060 --> 26:26.990
In the same way I expect all of you, the Sahaja
yogis of Australia, to have that beautiful

26:26.990 --> 26:37.040
personality of Shri Ganesha, and that you
emit that fragrance of innocence among all

26:37.040 --> 26:40.010
the Sahaja yogis, and then among all the world.

26:40.010 --> 26:41.280
May God bless you.
