00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:59.360
Now as the Kundalini rises, she enlightens your second center which we can call as the

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:03.520
Swadishthan Chakra for the time being, though it is the third center. But second center,

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:09.080
you become extremely creative, extremely creative.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.880
I know of a gentleman who came to Me, he had no job.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.600
And he said, “Mother, I have no job and what should I do?”

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.640
I said, “All right, what do you want to do?” He said, “Whatever you say.”

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.360
I said, “All right, why don't you become an interior decorator?”

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.560
He said, “Me? I don't know what is a teak wood, I don’t know what is a rose wood,

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.960
how am I to become an interior decorator?”

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.240
I said, “You just use your vibrations.”

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.960
And you'll be surprised he earned million of rupees out of that profession

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.000
because you become extremely creative,

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:46.480
your sense of creation becomes so subtle and so beautiful

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.120
that you start understanding art at such a high level

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.240
that people don't know how, when you are not educated in art, how you can do it.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:01.360
I went to Japan once, and they were having an Ikebana competition or something,

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.720
so I went to see the Ikebana class and they requested Me,

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.280
“Why don't you do some flower arrangements?”

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:08.800
I said, “All right, I'll do.”

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:14.640
I did it and I got the highest marks without knowing a word about Ikebana,

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.560
just surprise Me, I got the highest mark.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.960
I can do lots of things which I've never done before like architecture.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:25.320
I have built houses without doing any architecture,

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.160
I've done decorations of the houses,

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:32.400
I've done all kinds of things without knowing how to it,

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.000
because you become you so creative.

00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:37.840
Music you start understanding so much better.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:43.000
There are people now in America, there's a girl, she had a horrible hoarse voice,

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:47.440
absolutely hoarse voice, and she always used to go out of tune.

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.080
So I told her, “You shouldn’t sing songs before Me because it’s rather funny.”

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.680
She said, “Mother, why don't You give me a good voice?”

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.720
I said, “You just try your Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.880
if your Vishuddhi Chakra is corrected you'll be all right.”

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.120
[Shri Mataji speaks aside: Why don’t you sit down.]

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.520
So the Vishuddhi Chakra was … she tried on Vishuddhi Chakra giving vibrations,

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:19.280
and she sings so melodiously now that I tell you she can be a great singer.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:28.280
So the creativity, that also is a blessing of your power of the Goddess of learning.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.760
Boys who could not study in the schools were absolutely duffers.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:37.160
Some people brought this boy, recently I’ve received a letter from him.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.440
When he came to Me, his father said that “He is going to be taken out of school

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:45.640
because he's good for nothing, he can not remember anything, he's absolutely finished.”

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.080
I said, “All right, doesn't matter, let him take to Sahaja Yoga.”

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:56.680
He got his Realization. Not only that he passed with first class, but he got a scholarship.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.040
Then he passed another exam, he got a scholarship.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.240
Now he's got a very big job, at a very young age.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:10.120
He wrote to Me, “Mother no one can believe that a duffer like me has been so much highly placed.”

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.800
All the boys who got scholarships in Maharashtra

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:18.680
in schools, in colleges and universities are Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:25.480
It is such a tremendous force that starts working in you, if you try to give vibrations

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:36.240
say to fruits or to trees or to say wheat and such things

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.480
which are very important for life, any food,

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:45.800
you will be amazed that the food also grows so much more

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.000
and the taste is so good and it lasts you so longer.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:55.320
Like one gentleman tried, a university professor in agricultural college

00:17:55.400 --> 00:18:02.320
on some wheat, some vibrations and he was amazed that when they collected this wheat

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:06.000
it was at least six times more than normal,

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:12.000
and when this wheat was stored in a big hall like this,

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:20.480
there were so many other things, the rats who are always a menace in India never touched that wheat.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.160
They ate all the rest of it but never touched the wheat.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:32.040
Even the animals - the snails, even the tigers, of course the dogs and the cats -

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:37.040
understand it much more, they understand you, they know that you are a saint.

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:42.800
They'll never touch you, they will never trouble you. Even a tiger sees a saint, he never attacks.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.960
You can handle a tiger very easily; this is the power of a saint.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:51.600
So you develop a tremendous capacity of creativity.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:56.640
The greatest capacity you have then is of creating

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.840
a new human being out of a ordinary human being.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.880
This is the greatest blessing that you have, that you transform

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.440
an egg into a bird

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.320
and that is the epitome, that is the spiritual power you have,

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:17.720
by which you can transform the whole human race

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:24.360
into a new race which has this fifth dimension within yourself.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.680
You can start talking on science now, we have a scientist here and he's a done his science,

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.240
he is a Doctor of Science in this and that, in chemistry

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.360
and I explained to him about this

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.440
- where is the hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and all that within us

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.800
and he was amazed. He said, “Mother, how do you know all these things?”

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.960
I said, “I don't know how I know, but I know. That’s what it is, you just have a look at this.”

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:54.880
And he was amazed how I was telling him about spiral movement and linear movement of peptose.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.160
He said that “For this I had to study so much.”

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.480
I said, “For Sahaja Yog you don't have to study.”

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.520
A little bit you know and immediately you click the point.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:06.160
Now this is the second thing that you know in your learnings,

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.000
in your education you are all right,

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.760
but the mastery of this center comes, the mastery of this center comes

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:20.040
when you know the pure knowledge, the pure knowledge of handling the Kundalini,

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:27.720
the pure knowledge of Spirit, the pure knowledge of the blessings of God, of Ritambhara Pragya.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:34.000
If you know that, that is the highest that you achieve gradually as you grow,

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.680
because when these centers starts expanding on the sides,

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:46.360
you start expanding in your personality, in your sensitivity and in your evolutionary ascent.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:52.000
So that is how you start growing from one to another to another to another.
