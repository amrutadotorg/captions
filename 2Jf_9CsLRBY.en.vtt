13:51.880 --> 13:59.360
Now as the Kundalini rises, she enlightens your second center which we can call as the

13:59.440 --> 14:03.520
Swadishthan Chakra for the time being, though it is the third center. But second center,

14:03.600 --> 14:09.080
you become extremely creative, extremely creative.

14:09.160 --> 14:12.880
I know of a gentleman who came to Me, he had no job.

14:12.960 --> 14:16.600
And he said, “Mother, I have no job and what should I do?”

14:16.680 --> 14:20.640
I said, “All right, what do you want to do?” He said, “Whatever you say.”

14:20.720 --> 14:24.360
I said, “All right, why don't you become an interior decorator?”

14:24.440 --> 14:28.560
He said, “Me? I don't know what is a teak wood, I don’t know what is a rose wood,

14:28.640 --> 14:30.960
how am I to become an interior decorator?”

14:31.040 --> 14:33.240
I said, “You just use your vibrations.”

14:33.320 --> 14:37.960
And you'll be surprised he earned million of rupees out of that profession

14:38.040 --> 14:41.000
because you become extremely creative,

14:41.080 --> 14:46.480
your sense of creation becomes so subtle and so beautiful

14:46.560 --> 14:51.120
that you start understanding art at such a high level

14:51.200 --> 14:56.240
that people don't know how, when you are not educated in art, how you can do it.

14:56.320 --> 15:01.360
I went to Japan once, and they were having an Ikebana competition or something,

15:01.440 --> 15:04.720
so I went to see the Ikebana class and they requested Me,

15:04.800 --> 15:07.280
“Why don't you do some flower arrangements?”

15:07.360 --> 15:08.800
I said, “All right, I'll do.”

15:08.880 --> 15:14.640
I did it and I got the highest marks without knowing a word about Ikebana,

15:14.720 --> 15:17.560
just surprise Me, I got the highest mark.

15:17.640 --> 15:21.960
I can do lots of things which I've never done before like architecture.

15:22.040 --> 15:25.320
I have built houses without doing any architecture,

15:25.400 --> 15:27.160
I've done decorations of the houses,

15:27.240 --> 15:32.400
I've done all kinds of things without knowing how to it,

15:32.480 --> 15:35.000
because you become you so creative.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.840
Music you start understanding so much better.

15:37.920 --> 15:43.000
There are people now in America, there's a girl, she had a horrible hoarse voice,

15:43.080 --> 15:47.440
absolutely hoarse voice, and she always used to go out of tune.

15:47.520 --> 15:52.080
So I told her, “You shouldn’t sing songs before Me because it’s rather funny.”

15:52.160 --> 15:54.680
She said, “Mother, why don't You give me a good voice?”

15:54.760 --> 15:57.720
I said, “You just try your Vishuddhi Chakra,

15:57.800 --> 16:01.880
if your Vishuddhi Chakra is corrected you'll be all right.”

16:04.160 --> 16:06.120
[Shri Mataji speaks aside: Why don’t you sit down.]

16:08.400 --> 16:13.520
So the Vishuddhi Chakra was … she tried on Vishuddhi Chakra giving vibrations,

16:13.600 --> 16:19.280
and she sings so melodiously now that I tell you she can be a great singer.

16:19.360 --> 16:28.280
So the creativity, that also is a blessing of your power of the Goddess of learning.

16:28.360 --> 16:32.760
Boys who could not study in the schools were absolutely duffers.

16:32.840 --> 16:37.160
Some people brought this boy, recently I’ve received a letter from him.

16:37.240 --> 16:40.440
When he came to Me, his father said that “He is going to be taken out of school

16:40.520 --> 16:45.640
because he's good for nothing, he can not remember anything, he's absolutely finished.”

16:45.720 --> 16:49.080
I said, “All right, doesn't matter, let him take to Sahaja Yoga.”

16:49.160 --> 16:56.680
He got his Realization. Not only that he passed with first class, but he got a scholarship.

16:56.760 --> 17:00.040
Then he passed another exam, he got a scholarship.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.240
Now he's got a very big job, at a very young age.

17:03.320 --> 17:10.120
He wrote to Me, “Mother no one can believe that a duffer like me has been so much highly placed.”

17:10.200 --> 17:13.800
All the boys who got scholarships in Maharashtra

17:13.880 --> 17:18.680
in schools, in colleges and universities are Sahaja Yogis.

17:18.800 --> 17:25.480
It is such a tremendous force that starts working in you, if you try to give vibrations

17:25.560 --> 17:36.240
say to fruits or to trees or to say wheat and such things

17:36.320 --> 17:39.480
which are very important for life, any food,

17:39.560 --> 17:45.800
you will be amazed that the food also grows so much more

17:45.880 --> 17:50.000
and the taste is so good and it lasts you so longer.

17:50.080 --> 17:55.320
Like one gentleman tried, a university professor in agricultural college

17:55.400 --> 18:02.320
on some wheat, some vibrations and he was amazed that when they collected this wheat

18:02.400 --> 18:06.000
it was at least six times more than normal,

18:06.080 --> 18:12.000
and when this wheat was stored in a big hall like this,

18:12.080 --> 18:20.480
there were so many other things, the rats who are always a menace in India never touched that wheat.

18:20.560 --> 18:24.160
They ate all the rest of it but never touched the wheat.

18:24.240 --> 18:32.040
Even the animals - the snails, even the tigers, of course the dogs and the cats -

18:32.120 --> 18:37.040
understand it much more, they understand you, they know that you are a saint.

18:37.120 --> 18:42.800
They'll never touch you, they will never trouble you. Even a tiger sees a saint, he never attacks.

18:42.880 --> 18:46.960
You can handle a tiger very easily; this is the power of a saint.

18:47.040 --> 18:51.600
So you develop a tremendous capacity of creativity.

18:51.680 --> 18:56.640
The greatest capacity you have then is of creating

18:56.720 --> 19:01.840
a new human being out of a ordinary human being.

19:01.920 --> 19:05.880
This is the greatest blessing that you have, that you transform

19:05.960 --> 19:08.440
an egg into a bird

19:08.520 --> 19:12.320
and that is the epitome, that is the spiritual power you have,

19:12.400 --> 19:17.720
by which you can transform the whole human race

19:17.800 --> 19:24.360
into a new race which has this fifth dimension within yourself.

19:24.440 --> 19:29.680
You can start talking on science now, we have a scientist here and he's a done his science,

19:29.760 --> 19:33.240
he is a Doctor of Science in this and that, in chemistry

19:33.320 --> 19:35.360
and I explained to him about this

19:35.440 --> 19:39.440
- where is the hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and all that within us

19:39.520 --> 19:43.800
and he was amazed. He said, “Mother, how do you know all these things?”

19:43.880 --> 19:48.960
I said, “I don't know how I know, but I know. That’s what it is, you just have a look at this.”

19:49.040 --> 19:54.880
And he was amazed how I was telling him about spiral movement and linear movement of peptose.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.160
He said that “For this I had to study so much.”

19:57.240 --> 19:59.480
I said, “For Sahaja Yog you don't have to study.”

19:59.560 --> 20:02.520
A little bit you know and immediately you click the point.

20:02.600 --> 20:06.160
Now this is the second thing that you know in your learnings,

20:06.280 --> 20:09.000
in your education you are all right,

20:09.080 --> 20:13.760
but the mastery of this center comes, the mastery of this center comes

20:13.840 --> 20:20.040
when you know the pure knowledge, the pure knowledge of handling the Kundalini,

20:20.120 --> 20:27.720
the pure knowledge of Spirit, the pure knowledge of the blessings of God, of Ritambhara Pragya.

20:27.800 --> 20:34.000
If you know that, that is the highest that you achieve gradually as you grow,

20:34.080 --> 20:38.680
because when these centers starts expanding on the sides,

20:38.760 --> 20:46.360
you start expanding in your personality, in your sensitivity and in your evolutionary ascent.

20:46.440 --> 20:52.000
So that is how you start growing from one to another to another to another.
