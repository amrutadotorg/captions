00:00:19.792 --> 00:00:29.875
Today we are here to worship Shri Krishna.

00:00:53.999 --> 00:01:01.166
As you know Shri Krishna is the incarnation of Vishnu.

00:01:04.792 --> 00:01:14.667
And Vishnu is the one who is the preserver of this universe.

00:01:15.625 --> 00:01:19.959
When this whole world was created

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.291
it was necessary

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:34.792
to create a preserver also

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:38.166
because this world would have been destroyed

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:44.083
and completely if it is left alone without a preserver,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.917
then the way human beings are,

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:54.333
they could have done anything to this world.

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:57.166
But so, Vishnu is the preserver.

00:01:58.542 --> 00:02:03.083
He's the preserver and He's the only one really incarnates.

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:04.875
Of course,

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.417
sometimes Brahmadeva also incarnated,

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:10.792
but He only takes forms.

00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:14.999
In our evolutionary process He has taken different forms.

00:02:16.542 --> 00:02:20.250
He came on this earth in different ways.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.125
But still He had, as you say,

00:02:25.542 --> 00:02:26.917
twelve

00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:42.000
up to twelve was Shri Rama and up through ten He was there.

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:54.792
So He created also an atmosphere of the many great prophets

00:02:55.125 --> 00:03:01.458
around Himself so that they could preserve the dharma

00:03:02.417 --> 00:03:04.458
of this universe.

00:03:05.417 --> 00:03:12.000
So the basis of preservation was dharma,

00:03:13.083 --> 00:03:15.250
which has got, as you know,

00:03:16.583 --> 00:03:25.999
the most important basic foundation for spiritual life.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:32.458
In this dharma whatever was to be established

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.792
was to be established balance.

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.125
Was a habit with people to go to extremes in anything.

00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:45.667
So He created a balance within us.

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:51.542
The first principal of dharma was to create balance.

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:54.417
If a person doesn't have a balance

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.458
then he cannot achieve his ascent.

00:04:00.083 --> 00:04:01.083
As simple as that.

00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:05.834
If you don't have a balance in your airplane it cannot ascend.

00:04:06.208 --> 00:04:10.333
If you don't have a balance, say on a ship, it won't move.

00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:14.667
In the same way,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.875
first the human beings had to achieve the balance.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.667
But they are born with different capacities,

00:04:23.917 --> 00:04:26.250
with different capabilities.

00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:32.083
As said that, "Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Jhati rupena samstita",

00:04:32.542 --> 00:04:34.834
means the aptitudes are different.

00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:37.458
They are born with different aptitudes,

00:04:37.709 --> 00:04:39.542
with different faces, with different colors,

00:04:41.208 --> 00:04:43.709
because variety was to be created.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.667
If everybody looked the same, you see they would be looking

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:50.542
like some robots or something.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.250
So everybody was created in a different way,

00:04:55.583 --> 00:04:56.999
according to the country,

00:04:57.583 --> 00:04:59.458
according to the parents.

00:05:00.792 --> 00:05:07.917
All this was organized by the principal of Shri Vishnu,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.709
that He created this world in different varieties.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.917
He gave variety, and Shri Krishna is the master of it.

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:27.875
At the time when Shri Krishna came,

00:05:28.542 --> 00:05:31.208
people were extremely serious type

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:34.083
and had become very ritualistic.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:41.792
The reason was that Rama came and He talked of maryadas,

00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:45.250
and these maryadas made people extremely,

00:05:45.583 --> 00:05:47.709
extremely austere type.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.792
In that austerity people lost the sense of joy,

00:05:56.125 --> 00:05:59.208
sense of beauty, sense of variety.

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:03.083
So the Shri Krishna's incarnation

00:06:03.458 --> 00:06:05.834
came as we call it the Sampurna,

00:06:06.083 --> 00:06:08.667
it's complete because He has 16 petals.

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:15.333
As the moon has 16 kalas He too had 16 petals

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:22.250
so He's Sampurna and He is what we call is the Purnima,

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.041
is the full moon.

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:34.125
With this completeness of His incarnation,

00:06:34.375 --> 00:06:41.375
of Vishnu's incarnation from Vishnu to many other incarnations

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:46.333
He came as the complete incarnation;

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:52.667
the total of Shri Vishnu was manifested.

00:06:53.959 --> 00:07:00.917
So whatever was lacking in Rama's incarnation,

00:07:02.083 --> 00:07:03.792
He brought it forth.

00:07:04.458 --> 00:07:07.375
As you know that on the center - on the right heart

00:07:07.375 --> 00:07:09.375
you have twelve petals.

00:07:11.834 --> 00:07:15.709
With this He showed so many things

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.834
which people miss completely,

00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:24.458
because, unfortunately, Gita was written down.

00:07:26.041 --> 00:07:27.959
When Gita was written down,

00:07:30.458 --> 00:07:34.667
people started following the book word by word, not understanding.

00:07:35.834 --> 00:07:41.709
And in the Gita His message was never for peace.

00:07:42.083 --> 00:07:43.667
He didn't say you should be peaceful.

00:07:43.917 --> 00:07:45.792
It was something like Jihad.

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:51.333
That He said that to Arjuna, "You have to fight.

00:07:52.917 --> 00:07:55.834
At this time you have to fight for dharma,

00:07:56.208 --> 00:07:59.333
for the truth and you have to fight."

00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:02.083
Then He said, "I can't kill my uncles

00:08:02.375 --> 00:08:06.041
and I can't kill my grandfather and I can't kill my relations."

00:08:06.917 --> 00:08:11.458
He said, "Who, who are you killing, they're already dead."

00:08:12.667 --> 00:08:14.583
Because they have no dharma.

00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:17.959
If you have no dharma then you are already dead.

00:08:18.709 --> 00:08:20.792
So what is there to kill or not to kill

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.834
and that is what today we see in modern times,

00:08:25.834 --> 00:08:30.709
especially America which is the country of Vishuddhi.

00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:34.709
They have no dharma so they're already dead

00:08:35.375 --> 00:08:37.709
under dope or whatever you may call it,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.917
under fear of all kinds of diseases.

00:08:41.792 --> 00:08:45.583
They are already dead and whom are you going to kill?

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:54.375
And this message was in Kurukshetra He gave to Arjuna.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.792
But then he said, "You have asked me to kill these people

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:07.375
because I have Dharma in me. I am killing them, alright,

00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:11.125
but what beyond this?"

00:09:11.583 --> 00:09:13.083
What is beyond that?

00:09:14.125 --> 00:09:16.500
So He describes Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:18.375 --> 00:09:21.375
Beyond this was Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:21.792 --> 00:09:24.458
Was, first He describes in the second chapter

00:09:24.959 --> 00:09:27.458
who is the Stitha Pragya,

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.000
is the man who is balanced.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.083
Then he says that such a man is never angry.

00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:42.083
He doesn't get angry.

00:09:42.333 --> 00:09:45.458
Inside he is absolutely at peace.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.959
So what He described later on is really the modern times,

00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:54.792
or we can say our Sahaja Yoga

00:09:55.208 --> 00:09:59.917
in which He said how a person should become.

00:10:00.417 --> 00:10:05.834
He didn't write, or He didn't say how to become that,

00:10:06.625 --> 00:10:11.291
but the description is just like Christ I think where He says that

00:10:12.041 --> 00:10:15.500
if you somebody slaps you on one face you put the

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.583
other side of the face.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.875
All this is actually description of Sahaja Yogis

00:10:24.417 --> 00:10:26.166
of the future.

00:10:26.166 --> 00:10:31.291
Not at that time when Khauravas were fighting the Pandavas.

00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:33.000
It was not at that time.

00:10:38.792 --> 00:10:41.166
During that fight He told him

00:10:41.458 --> 00:10:48.667
that if you become a Stitha Pragya then you can transcend

00:10:49.208 --> 00:10:51.000
all these problems,

00:10:52.333 --> 00:10:55.542
all these understandings that you have,

00:10:55.999 --> 00:10:59.333
and you become absolutely peaceful with yourself.

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:05.792
So on one side He said you have to fight.

00:11:06.417 --> 00:11:10.208
Now in modern times we do not have to fight Kauravas,

00:11:10.458 --> 00:11:12.125
there are no Kauravas

00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:16.333
The five Pandavas have to fight the Khauravas.

00:11:17.667 --> 00:11:21.417
So now what are these five Pandavas?

00:11:22.125 --> 00:11:24.375
They are our senses

00:11:24.709 --> 00:11:29.000
or we can call they are the cosmos,

00:11:30.917 --> 00:11:35.041
divided into various elements.

00:11:35.542 --> 00:11:39.125
One side. They have to fight,

00:11:39.709 --> 00:11:43.000
they have to fight the Kauravas

00:11:43.291 --> 00:11:45.125
which are within us.

00:11:45.667 --> 00:11:48.999
Now there are hundred Kauravas, not one.

00:11:50.208 --> 00:11:53.583
It is, if you extend it

00:11:53.917 --> 00:11:58.083
then we can say the nature has to fight

00:11:58.709 --> 00:12:02.083
something that is against the nature.

00:12:03.125 --> 00:12:05.709
Now people will say anger is natural,

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:09.709
getting annoyed is natural,

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:11.625
to be aggressive is natural.

00:12:11.959 --> 00:12:13.041
It is not.

00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:21.125
Anger and all these things may have been natural,

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:31.583
but now we must know that we have the natural capacity to ascend.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.583
Is natural to go higher.

00:12:36.041 --> 00:12:39.834
It is natural to be Stitha pragya.

00:12:40.291 --> 00:12:43.000
It is natural to be Sahaja Yogi.

00:12:44.417 --> 00:12:46.500
This is also built in us, in us.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.709
For example a seed is a seed.

00:12:49.625 --> 00:12:51.583
When it is seed we call it seed.

00:12:51.583 --> 00:12:53.750
Alright, naturally is to be seed,

00:12:54.125 --> 00:12:57.375
but then it sprouts and becomes the tree.

00:12:58.041 --> 00:13:01.125
So it is also natural in a seed

00:13:02.166 --> 00:13:06.375
that all that future,

00:13:06.875 --> 00:13:08.625
all the thousands of trees

00:13:08.917 --> 00:13:12.125
it is going to be is also in that seed.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.750
And now as you know they're experimenting that

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.166
in one seed you can get thousand

00:13:17.709 --> 00:13:23.375
minimum of thousands of little, little sprouts in one seed

00:13:23.375 --> 00:13:27.750
and which can be made all of them into trees or plants.

00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:30.583
This is a new thing that has come up.

00:13:31.625 --> 00:13:35.875
So when He said that

00:13:35.875 --> 00:13:38.250
you have to become a Stitha pragya

00:13:38.583 --> 00:13:43.166
what He was trying to say that you should achieve your balance.

00:13:43.709 --> 00:13:45.375
Now this He told,

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.583
there was a war on.

00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:51.625
When they were warring,

00:13:52.166 --> 00:13:54.166
alright, you have to do it.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.959
If you have to war with people,

00:13:57.166 --> 00:13:58.959
if you have to kill them it's all right.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.583
But afterwards,

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.834
once that is over

00:14:06.125 --> 00:14:10.041
then what you have to do is to build up your spiritual sense.

00:14:14.875 --> 00:14:17.625
Now the building up of the spiritual sense

00:14:18.625 --> 00:14:22.750
is our work and that's what we have to do.

00:14:26.458 --> 00:14:28.291
Not only dharma.

00:14:28.291 --> 00:14:32.583
Many Sahaja Yogis think that they are going in dharma

00:14:32.875 --> 00:14:34.375
so they are alright.

00:14:34.917 --> 00:14:36.583
They are working in dharma,

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:38.709
they are living in a dharmic life.

00:14:38.709 --> 00:14:42.917
They are. I'm very surprised and happy that they are doing it.

00:14:43.917 --> 00:14:46.000
But that's not the end of it.

00:14:46.291 --> 00:14:48.000
That's the balance part

00:14:48.583 --> 00:14:50.625
where you are balancing yourself.

00:14:51.458 --> 00:14:54.458
Now, what you have to do is to go ahead

00:14:54.834 --> 00:14:58.291
and build up your spiritual self and spread it.

00:14:59.125 --> 00:15:01.166
This is the work of Shri Krishna also

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:06.125
because He's the one who communicates all over.

00:15:06.375 --> 00:15:09.166
As you know America is communicating everywhere

00:15:09.583 --> 00:15:11.041
in a wrong way - but it is.

00:15:12.291 --> 00:15:13.500
It has got computers,

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.750
it has got this,

00:15:15.041 --> 00:15:17.125
all communication things it has done

00:15:17.125 --> 00:15:21.125
because it is innately built in them to communicate.

00:15:23.458 --> 00:15:26.917
But because they don't believe in Shri Krishna,

00:15:27.166 --> 00:15:28.709
neither in dharma,

00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:31.917
so the basis itself is wrong,

00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:36.917
and with this wrong basis they have started spreading.

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.625
With this very, very wrong basis

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.125
they have started spreading ah,

00:15:44.458 --> 00:15:48.500
all kinds of filth and dirt and I don't know what to call it,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.709
which is against human beings,

00:15:52.166 --> 00:15:54.000
which is against our ascent,

00:15:54.375 --> 00:15:56.166
which is against God.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.417
And they are doing all this.

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:00.709
Why?

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Why are they doing which they are not supposed to do?

00:16:10.959 --> 00:16:12.542
I think is the intellect.

00:16:14.041 --> 00:16:17.041
Their intellect which is also,

00:16:17.583 --> 00:16:23.834
I should say is the brain, which is the seat of Virat.

00:16:24.125 --> 00:16:26.417
Can you imagine? Is the seat of Virat.

00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:30.625
And with their intellect, what do they do?

00:16:32.041 --> 00:16:33.834
They say it is natural.

00:16:34.375 --> 00:16:36.542
It is natural to be adharmic.

00:16:37.709 --> 00:16:42.875
It is natural to be aggressive.

00:16:43.583 --> 00:16:46.041
It is natural to be money oriented.

00:16:47.041 --> 00:16:50.291
Everything that they have is all natural

00:16:51.125 --> 00:16:52.999
because according to them

00:16:53.875 --> 00:16:59.959
with their intellect they have somehow or other managed

00:17:00.375 --> 00:17:04.125
to convince through your rationality

00:17:05.166 --> 00:17:07.291
that this is the correct thing to do.

00:17:07.959 --> 00:17:10.041
Without this you cannot exist.

00:17:10.875 --> 00:17:14.291
I mean this is supposed to be their culture now.

00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:16.999
Now if that is the culture all over,

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:18.625
it's not only in America all over,

00:17:18.625 --> 00:17:20.583
this sort of a nonsensical culture

00:17:20.875 --> 00:17:23.834
is accepted because of the intellect.

00:17:24.583 --> 00:17:26.125
They are much more intelligent.

00:17:26.375 --> 00:17:29.500
You see a person who always thinks of money, this, that,

00:17:29.834 --> 00:17:31.166
naturally becomes very intelligent

00:17:31.166 --> 00:17:33.375
in the sense he becomes sharp.

00:17:34.375 --> 00:17:35.709
He becomes smart.

00:17:36.041 --> 00:17:38.834
He becomes smart, smart in a way,

00:17:39.041 --> 00:17:41.500
something as if he knows everything.

00:17:41.875 --> 00:17:43.875
He starts thinking he knows everything,

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.875
whatever he's doing he is right,

00:17:46.166 --> 00:17:48.375
whatever the way he is behaving he is right.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.291
So, these Pandavas which he has got within himself,

00:17:53.875 --> 00:17:56.125
these elements that he has got,

00:17:56.834 --> 00:17:58.959
he uses them for a purpose

00:18:01.625 --> 00:18:03.709
which is destructive,

00:18:03.959 --> 00:18:06.750
absolutely destructive - anti God.

00:18:07.375 --> 00:18:08.959
And he is not aware

00:18:09.291 --> 00:18:12.166
because his intelligence always justifies.

00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:15.375
Whatever he's doing is justified.

00:18:15.625 --> 00:18:23.625
And He has given also so much of brains to these intellectuals

00:18:24.166 --> 00:18:28.709
that they also try to go against what is dharma.

00:18:31.083 --> 00:18:33.417
For example, even Shri Krishna's life

00:18:34.999 --> 00:18:36.959
they try to depict by saying

00:18:38.166 --> 00:18:41.083
that Shri Krishna Himself had five wives

00:18:41.542 --> 00:18:43.834
and He had sixteen wives later on.

00:18:44.166 --> 00:18:46.166
Actually these were His power.

00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:51.999
But without understanding what Shri Krishna was,

00:18:51.999 --> 00:18:54.750
because intellect is such a gross nonsense

00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:59.166
that it doesn't take you to the right thinking;

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.417
always to the wrong thinking,

00:19:01.959 --> 00:19:04.709
it moves you because you want to justify

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.959
everything and this justification

00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:11.542
makes you live with yourself.

00:19:12.041 --> 00:19:13.500
Otherwise, normally,

00:19:13.875 --> 00:19:15.542
you can't live with yourself.

00:19:16.999 --> 00:19:19.667
It is very difficult to live

00:19:20.083 --> 00:19:21.750
with a life which is adharmic,

00:19:21.999 --> 00:19:23.041
which is aggressive,

00:19:23.333 --> 00:19:25.458
which is, what you can call,

00:19:25.875 --> 00:19:27.792
a war mongering type.

00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:29.750
But they live.

00:19:30.041 --> 00:19:34.250
So, all that is expected of a human being,

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.166
just the opposite of that,

00:19:36.166 --> 00:19:37.959
juxtaposition of that,

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.959
is being done in all these western cultures.

00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:47.333
You can see it clearly how they justify.

00:19:48.291 --> 00:19:50.792
Immorality they can justify.

00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:53.041
One Mr. Freud came in.

00:19:53.625 --> 00:19:55.417
He replaced even Christ.

00:19:56.959 --> 00:20:00.166
Of course, I mean, he had to because Christ was even more

00:20:00.417 --> 00:20:02.041
strict than Mohammed sahib

00:20:02.291 --> 00:20:05.208
who said anybody does anything with one eye,

00:20:06.083 --> 00:20:08.667
with the eyes, he should take out one eye,

00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:14.667
and anybody who's hand is spoiling him should,

00:20:14.999 --> 00:20:16.291
he should cut his hand.

00:20:16.542 --> 00:20:19.208
I mean most of the Europeans and Americans

00:20:19.208 --> 00:20:21.625
would have been without one hand I think,

00:20:22.792 --> 00:20:24.166
according to Christ.

00:20:24.166 --> 00:20:26.500
Thank God they didn't follow Him to that point.

00:20:27.417 --> 00:20:31.083
And, also Mohammed sahib thought

00:20:31.083 --> 00:20:33.542
that Christ has done so much for the men,

00:20:33.542 --> 00:20:35.625
why not we do something for the women also,

00:20:35.625 --> 00:20:37.166
so He made something for women.

00:20:37.625 --> 00:20:41.542
Both of them are too much for human beings.

00:20:41.792 --> 00:20:43.083
They didn't realize it.

00:20:43.417 --> 00:20:45.625
Who's going to take out one eye for that?

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.291
They have intellect.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.208
Now, if they are looking at many women,

00:20:51.875 --> 00:20:54.542
there's a justification - is natural.

00:20:56.333 --> 00:20:58.750
Have you seen any animal behaving like that

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:00.792
if the animals are natural beings?

00:21:01.208 --> 00:21:02.999
We are worse than animals.

00:21:05.417 --> 00:21:09.959
And what a mess we have created with this kind of understanding

00:21:10.208 --> 00:21:12.667
through these intellectuals

00:21:12.667 --> 00:21:18.208
who are trying to tell us something, and we accept.

00:21:19.417 --> 00:21:21.625
So this is one of the problems

00:21:21.959 --> 00:21:25.959
is if there's an intelligent man, he dominates.

00:21:28.083 --> 00:21:31.291
Now, for example, some fashion starts.

00:21:34.166 --> 00:21:35.667
We all take it.

00:21:35.667 --> 00:21:37.166
It's a fashion.

00:21:37.166 --> 00:21:39.959
But why are you taking it? It's a fashion.

00:21:41.417 --> 00:21:44.625
So, the intellect of an entrepreneur

00:21:44.959 --> 00:21:47.417
can really befool you completely.

00:21:48.875 --> 00:21:51.166
But not with people who are wise.

00:21:51.875 --> 00:21:54.667
They will say, "Get lost, we have had all this."

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.999
This is about morality part.

00:22:02.333 --> 00:22:07.542
That is the worst practiced in the West,

00:22:08.417 --> 00:22:10.417
and worse than animals I should say.

00:22:10.792 --> 00:22:12.959
And that's how they are suffering today.

00:22:13.875 --> 00:22:15.792
They are suffering with so many diseases,

00:22:15.792 --> 00:22:17.792
so many troubles, this, that.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:23.291
Second thing which we always justify is violence.

00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:26.709
Now there is no war going on in Kurukshetra.

00:22:27.959 --> 00:22:29.875
But you see violence everywhere.

00:22:29.875 --> 00:22:31.709
In America it's terrible.

00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:35.250
When my daughter went she took out all her ornaments,

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:36.709
put it with Me.

00:22:36.959 --> 00:22:39.041
She said, "Mummy, I can't carry this."

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.250
Nothing was given to the girl.

00:22:41.583 --> 00:22:43.500
All artificial things were given

00:22:44.166 --> 00:22:46.417
because you can be killed for it.

00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:51.125
I'm not saying it's only in America. It's everywhere.

00:22:51.375 --> 00:22:53.750
Because everybody's guru is America.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.166
It starts from America,

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.166
the gurudom and people just follow blindly.

00:23:01.166 --> 00:23:03.709
So the violence is now entering into our films,

00:23:03.999 --> 00:23:07.750
Indian films also, but now they have taken some objection.

00:23:08.999 --> 00:23:11.417
Maybe it is too much for us.

00:23:11.959 --> 00:23:14.417
But this kind of thing that

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.041
you can kill anybody,

00:23:19.417 --> 00:23:20.999
so if you go on like this,

00:23:20.999 --> 00:23:25.041
you see if that is the criteria of greatness

00:23:25.041 --> 00:23:27.667
then Rwanda people should be placed highest

00:23:27.959 --> 00:23:29.417
in the evolutionary process.

00:23:30.999 --> 00:23:35.999
Killing somebody is not allowed. Thou shalt not kill.

00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:40.083
Muslims are killing.

00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:42.667
Everbody's killing everyone.

00:23:42.959 --> 00:23:45.417
The other day they killed a very nice man in India

00:23:45.667 --> 00:23:47.166
for nothing at all.

00:23:48.375 --> 00:23:51.125
This idea of aggressiveness

00:23:51.125 --> 00:23:53.834
ultimately takes you to the killing part.

00:23:54.125 --> 00:23:57.792
You can't even create one ant.

00:23:59.333 --> 00:24:01.792
How can you kill human beings like that?

00:24:03.125 --> 00:24:05.834
Of course, this killing business

00:24:06.208 --> 00:24:09.500
is taken to the highest limit,

00:24:09.834 --> 00:24:13.208
like Hitler believed that he was top of the world.

00:24:13.208 --> 00:24:15.041
This is same,

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:19.083
that you just forget what you are

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.125
and you start assuming through your ego

00:24:22.125 --> 00:24:24.333
that you are something very great.

00:24:26.458 --> 00:24:28.667
Also, in Sahaja Yoga I find recently

00:24:28.917 --> 00:24:31.125
there are some people who are saying they're gods,

00:24:31.375 --> 00:24:33.583
they're deities, everything.

00:24:36.834 --> 00:24:39.000
So this ego business

00:24:39.333 --> 00:24:43.000
is actually taking energy of your intelligence,

00:24:43.458 --> 00:24:45.834
and the greatest enemy of a human being is,

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:48.208
is his intelligence, I think,

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.125
because it's so limited,

00:24:50.375 --> 00:24:52.208
it is so conditioned,

00:24:52.583 --> 00:24:54.500
and it is so arrogant,

00:24:54.834 --> 00:24:57.000
and it is so blind.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.792
Wisdom is a different thing.

00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:04.125
Wisdom you don't get in colleges,

00:25:04.125 --> 00:25:06.208
schools, universities, nowhere.

00:25:06.834 --> 00:25:09.125
Where do you get it, the wisdom?

00:25:09.792 --> 00:25:12.083
You get it through your Spirit,

00:25:12.375 --> 00:25:15.000
which gives you a complete idea

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:18.667
as to what is right and what is wrong.

00:25:19.333 --> 00:25:24.500
Whatever is wrong will be accepted by intellect, always.

00:25:24.917 --> 00:25:29.500
Intellect is not wisdom one must understand.

00:25:29.917 --> 00:25:33.792
They're two things - wisdom and intellect.

00:25:34.458 --> 00:25:38.834
Now Krishna was known to be the diplomat.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.709
He had Divine diplomacy.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.583
That means what?

00:25:43.917 --> 00:25:45.583
He was very intelligent,

00:25:45.959 --> 00:25:48.250
no doubt. Without that you can't do.

00:25:48.542 --> 00:25:52.750
I've met some people who are very highly placed

00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:54.417
who don't have much intelligence even,

00:25:54.417 --> 00:26:01.667
but I have now seen that this intellect is a dangerous thing.

00:26:03.291 --> 00:26:04.625
So Shri Krishna,

00:26:05.999 --> 00:26:09.208
He used His intellect.

00:26:10.333 --> 00:26:11.999
He is all powerful.

00:26:12.375 --> 00:26:13.750
Nothing can dominate Him.

00:26:13.999 --> 00:26:15.999
Even his intellect cannot dominate Him.

00:26:16.375 --> 00:26:17.999
He used His intellect.

00:26:17.999 --> 00:26:20.291
Difference between the two you should see.

00:26:20.667 --> 00:26:23.375
You should be able to use your intellect

00:26:23.625 --> 00:26:25.875
and not to be dominated by your intellect.

00:26:27.166 --> 00:26:31.875
So He used His intellect by which He solved many problems.

00:26:32.375 --> 00:26:36.999
His whole diplomacy was to use His intellect

00:26:37.959 --> 00:26:41.166
and use it for the purpose of Divine.

00:26:41.542 --> 00:26:44.375
All the time the Divine in Him

00:26:45.417 --> 00:26:48.208
was helping Him to use His intellect.

00:26:48.667 --> 00:26:52.750
So the difference is that we are slaves of our intellect

00:26:54.375 --> 00:26:56.999
and He is the master of His intellect;

00:26:57.999 --> 00:26:59.667
not only, everything.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.834
His conditioning He is master,

00:27:03.125 --> 00:27:04.542
His emotions He is master,

00:27:05.999 --> 00:27:08.375
His body He's the master.

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.625
He's master of everything.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:14.834
And when you master it you see your intellect very clearly,

00:27:14.834 --> 00:27:17.542
oh, this is what it is suggesting.

00:27:18.999 --> 00:27:20.250
This is not.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:24.291
This intellect can give you very so-called positive ideas

00:27:24.542 --> 00:27:27.375
that you are the lord of the whole world.

00:27:27.625 --> 00:27:29.041
It's supposed to be positive.

00:27:29.375 --> 00:27:31.999
Or the same intellect can give you ideas

00:27:33.041 --> 00:27:35.083
that you are nothing.

00:27:36.417 --> 00:27:40.250
This intellect plays on top of you.

00:27:41.083 --> 00:27:44.917
Now you are not to be guided by your intellect,

00:27:44.917 --> 00:27:46.792
but by your wisdom,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.917
as you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:27:49.667 --> 00:27:52.667
So, you have a very good instrument of feeling it-

00:27:52.667 --> 00:27:54.792
through your vibrations you can make out

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.208
what is good and what is bad.

00:27:58.999 --> 00:28:01.333
And you can see sometimes,

00:28:01.333 --> 00:28:02.667
as being human beings,

00:28:02.667 --> 00:28:06.875
there are some intellectual effects also coming in.

00:28:07.625 --> 00:28:09.917
But with Sahaja Yoga you can judge,

00:28:11.166 --> 00:28:13.000
what is this intellect telling you.

00:28:13.333 --> 00:28:16.875
Because the intellect that you have has come out of what

00:28:17.083 --> 00:28:20.542
is the main thing; should go to the subtle point

00:28:20.792 --> 00:28:23.458
how this intellect has come to us.

00:28:25.291 --> 00:28:30.417
This intellect has come to us because our brain became,

00:28:30.917 --> 00:28:32.999
active very soon.

00:28:33.417 --> 00:28:35.917
I've seen some children extremely intelligent,

00:28:36.667 --> 00:28:38.291
but they have no wisdom.

00:28:41.625 --> 00:28:44.417
If your - only the brain develops too much,

00:28:44.417 --> 00:28:46.792
could be a mother is a very,

00:28:48.083 --> 00:28:49.792
intelligent woman and,

00:28:50.333 --> 00:28:52.083
father must be very intelligent,

00:28:52.458 --> 00:28:53.917
inheritance would be great,

00:28:54.208 --> 00:28:55.583
so they get it.

00:28:56.083 --> 00:28:58.000
Or maybe the circumstances,

00:28:58.417 --> 00:29:00.542
like if you are born in a particular country

00:29:00.542 --> 00:29:02.583
you suddenly become very intelligent.

00:29:03.458 --> 00:29:06.458
I've seen Americans, they read all the time.

00:29:06.458 --> 00:29:08.000
All the time you see them reading.

00:29:08.291 --> 00:29:09.667
Even English they read.

00:29:10.333 --> 00:29:13.083
But what is the outcome of all that reading I don't know.

00:29:14.999 --> 00:29:16.792
Every book they will read.

00:29:17.291 --> 00:29:19.834
If you ask them what is a computer, they know the computers,

00:29:19.834 --> 00:29:21.834
this thing, that thing, that thing, all the. . .

00:29:21.834 --> 00:29:25.834
I don't know how to even put off my television.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.500
If you ask them about television they will know they'll . . .

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:34.291
anything you want to know about mechanical things they will know.

00:29:34.583 --> 00:29:36.458
Anything about politics they will know,

00:29:36.917 --> 00:29:39.041
who's father was that and they will tell you that,

00:29:39.041 --> 00:29:41.583
"No, no, no, no this is like this, this like that."

00:29:41.917 --> 00:29:48.625
All this is avidya; is not knowledge. It is non-knowledge.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.125
So they think they're very intelligent

00:29:52.125 --> 00:29:55.834
because they know everything, about everything.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:58.500
Now, with this intellect,

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:02.375
as this consciousness comes in they start creating

00:30:02.625 --> 00:30:05.166
very intellectual ideas.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:07.709
Especially in America I have seen

00:30:07.959 --> 00:30:10.375
they have got for children

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:16.125
all kinds of funny things just to extract money.

00:30:16.375 --> 00:30:19.667
For example, there is a golliwog or something

00:30:19.667 --> 00:30:20.959
which has a birthday.

00:30:20.959 --> 00:30:22.667
Can you imagine?

00:30:23.583 --> 00:30:26.583
A birthday is there and sometimes,

00:30:26.583 --> 00:30:32.917
you see even the, people have big parties for that.

00:30:33.999 --> 00:30:37.667
Then they started, let us have birthday of the dogs,

00:30:38.667 --> 00:30:41.542
so they are having birthdays of the dogs.

00:30:42.667 --> 00:30:44.792
Anybody who puts ideas into them.

00:30:45.208 --> 00:30:47.250
Then there are organizations

00:30:47.667 --> 00:30:50.000
where they say, "All right, when you are going to die,

00:30:50.999 --> 00:30:52.917
you tell us what suit you want to wear,

00:30:52.917 --> 00:30:56.458
what tie you want to wear, what shoes, what clothes,

00:30:56.458 --> 00:30:58.333
then what, in of,

00:30:58.333 --> 00:31:01.542
what kind of a coffin you want to go - plastic,

00:31:01.542 --> 00:31:03.917
or wood, or this and that." I mean . . .

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.917
So it is to be prescribed

00:31:07.375 --> 00:31:09.583
to such an extent that some people say,

00:31:09.583 --> 00:31:12.458
"Put us in the ice, you see, so we'll be there."

00:31:14.458 --> 00:31:16.834
The worst thing, I think,

00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:19.000
especially in Europe, is

00:31:19.458 --> 00:31:25.834
that they have nicely advertised and marketed

00:31:26.458 --> 00:31:29.000
the thing of going for a holiday.

00:31:30.834 --> 00:31:36.250
So, in Italy supposing a person doesn't go to holiday,

00:31:36.542 --> 00:31:38.834
he'll say, "There's a crisis in my life."

00:31:38.834 --> 00:31:41.000
"What?" "I couldn't go to holiday."

00:31:41.709 --> 00:31:43.583
Then they said you must go there,

00:31:43.834 --> 00:31:45.083
tan your faces,

00:31:45.583 --> 00:31:49.083
stay there in hotels so, so many hotels have come up.

00:31:49.458 --> 00:31:51.333
Everybody has to go out.

00:31:51.667 --> 00:31:52.583
Especially I was surprised

00:31:52.583 --> 00:31:55.208
the whole of Milan is closed for one month.

00:31:55.458 --> 00:31:57.542
Nobody you can find there.

00:31:57.917 --> 00:32:02.999
See, I think if they all go and live in jungles

00:32:02.999 --> 00:32:04.375
would be a better idea.

00:32:04.709 --> 00:32:06.125
They will learn much more

00:32:06.375 --> 00:32:08.542
than to waste their time on the seashore.

00:32:08.792 --> 00:32:10.583
They're spoiling all the seashores.

00:32:11.208 --> 00:32:14.458
They have no respect for the sea which is their Father.

00:32:14.999 --> 00:32:18.542
They have no respect for each other.

00:32:19.542 --> 00:32:22.917
The women try to slim down and to look very nice

00:32:22.917 --> 00:32:25.250
so that they could become nude there.

00:32:25.542 --> 00:32:28.375
The whole industry is so bad.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.375
I mean if, somebody says would you like to come to the seashore,

00:32:31.375 --> 00:32:32.959
I would not go.

00:32:34.291 --> 00:32:38.875
I would hate to go to a place to see so many stupid ladies

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:42.041
in the sun busy trying to tan themselves.

00:32:42.458 --> 00:32:47.000
Now this stupid idea how could you accept if you are intelligent?

00:32:53.375 --> 00:32:56.166
There are so many ideas prevalent today,

00:32:56.458 --> 00:32:58.959
mostly coming from America, I must say,

00:33:00.166 --> 00:33:04.125
that you people follow. As I said

00:33:04.375 --> 00:33:07.166
that America is the guru of all the Eastern,

00:33:07.166 --> 00:33:12.959
of all our European and English and all these people.

00:33:15.875 --> 00:33:18.709
Now, then another thing happens.

00:33:19.166 --> 00:33:22.625
You see the atmosphere in which you live.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.375
Especially in England I have noticed.

00:33:26.375 --> 00:33:28.166
They may be nothing, you know.

00:33:28.417 --> 00:33:32.041
There was a garbage cleaner who came to our house

00:33:32.834 --> 00:33:35.250
and we had that time with us a president

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:39.000
of the Hague high court, imagine, the world high court.

00:33:39.625 --> 00:33:42.583
So, I told him, "You have to clear out all these things."

00:33:42.583 --> 00:33:47.000
"It's too much!" As usual, you see they are very,

00:33:47.792 --> 00:33:51.166
I don't know what to say, but, stupidly proud about themselves.

00:33:51.792 --> 00:33:54.917
"You don't understand." I said, "How much do you want?"

00:33:54.917 --> 00:33:56.083
I gave him ten pounds.

00:33:56.083 --> 00:33:58.208
In those days ten pounds was a big thing.

00:33:58.542 --> 00:34:00.542
He said, "You don't understand the laws,

00:34:00.792 --> 00:34:03.000
you see you are all Indians, niggers, this that."

00:34:03.667 --> 00:34:06.208
Then this gentleman who was in our house

00:34:06.208 --> 00:34:07.999
he came out and he asked him,

00:34:07.999 --> 00:34:09.750
"Why are you shouting here?"

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:12.208
"You nigger, you don't understand any laws."

00:34:12.458 --> 00:34:17.000
He is the chairman of the world high court

00:34:17.291 --> 00:34:19.917
and this stupid Englishman talking like that.

00:34:20.208 --> 00:34:22.208
The English are really, in a way,

00:34:22.208 --> 00:34:24.333
they are really dumb people

00:34:24.875 --> 00:34:27.166
because their intelligence never told,

00:34:27.417 --> 00:34:29.458
tells them that you are nothing.

00:34:29.792 --> 00:34:31.166
What are you proud of?

00:34:33.291 --> 00:34:34.999
Such dumb people they are.

00:34:35.667 --> 00:34:37.583
I don't know it might have come frozen

00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:39.583
with the cold or anything,

00:34:39.917 --> 00:34:41.750
but they think they are very intelligent.

00:34:42.333 --> 00:34:44.083
Their scholarship was all right,

00:34:44.083 --> 00:34:47.417
but I was amazed that in the beginning of the scholarship

00:34:47.417 --> 00:34:49.291
that they had, they said

00:34:49.542 --> 00:34:51.667
that the black people are like beasts.

00:34:53.875 --> 00:34:56.000
There are so many books written about it,

00:34:56.542 --> 00:34:58.792
and they accepted that black people are like beasts

00:34:58.792 --> 00:35:00.750
while these people were living,

00:35:01.083 --> 00:35:02.417
like I don't know what,

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:07.083
at the time when Black were much more advanced.

00:35:09.333 --> 00:35:13.125
So, this kind of an idea when they have I see here also.

00:35:13.709 --> 00:35:17.542
I can see this that English have,

00:35:17.792 --> 00:35:19.709
they think no end of themselves.

00:35:21.458 --> 00:35:24.792
But they don't understand they don't know anything.

00:35:25.999 --> 00:35:27.208
They have no wisdom.

00:35:27.208 --> 00:35:29.083
They lived in India for 300 years.

00:35:29.333 --> 00:35:31.542
They never learned anything from India.

00:35:32.083 --> 00:35:34.000
Can you imagine their wisdom part?

00:35:37.542 --> 00:35:38.999
Their scholarship,

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:40.417
some of them,

00:35:40.792 --> 00:35:42.417
but still ambiguous.

00:35:42.999 --> 00:35:45.250
Say Bernard Shaw I think was very ambiguous.

00:35:45.542 --> 00:35:48.250
I place him as a very great writer, but ambiguous.

00:35:49.458 --> 00:35:53.000
And then comes the French, God save.

00:35:55.208 --> 00:35:58.458
Now how have they denied Shri Krishna

00:35:58.458 --> 00:36:03.542
you can see very clearly in French people.

00:36:04.333 --> 00:36:08.917
French wanted to become the highest in diplomacy.

00:36:09.208 --> 00:36:12.333
They lack diplomacy completely. Useless people.

00:36:13.208 --> 00:36:16.208
They made our telephone in India the way they have spoiled it.

00:36:16.542 --> 00:36:21.125
So, they started a cult of drinking.

00:36:21.125 --> 00:36:24.709
Now can you imagine Shri Krishna drinking all these things?

00:36:24.999 --> 00:36:27.999
They have a dictionary on drinking on, everything.

00:36:27.999 --> 00:36:29.792
There's books after books written.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.999
I mean you imagine how could any evolved people

00:36:34.208 --> 00:36:37.208
accept this kind of a nonsensical culture

00:36:37.208 --> 00:36:39.458
that you must know what to drink,

00:36:39.458 --> 00:36:41.375
what to buy, what to put in,

00:36:41.667 --> 00:36:45.250
what sort of a tumblers to be put?

00:36:45.917 --> 00:36:48.542
They are all tumblers, nothing but tumblers I think.

00:36:49.083 --> 00:36:51.458
How could they accept such a thing

00:36:52.458 --> 00:36:56.208
which is so stupid, is a social acceptance?

00:36:57.542 --> 00:37:00.792
Prostitution is another social acceptance.

00:37:01.542 --> 00:37:05.333
Morality-wise they have really denied completely

00:37:05.583 --> 00:37:08.583
the principal of Shri Krishna.

00:37:12.208 --> 00:37:15.999
The way they have been ruining their people

00:37:17.083 --> 00:37:20.917
and to beat up everything is racialism.

00:37:23.917 --> 00:37:29.667
Can you think that for the skin you separate people?

00:37:30.999 --> 00:37:33.125
On the contrary I would say the Black,

00:37:33.417 --> 00:37:35.458
especially in India; they're much more evolved

00:37:35.999 --> 00:37:37.999
than all the white skins put together,

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.667
because they have wisdom.

00:37:42.583 --> 00:37:44.208
They are wiser people.

00:37:45.166 --> 00:37:46.709
But these white skins,

00:37:47.166 --> 00:37:49.709
they are going to - I mean,

00:37:49.709 --> 00:37:51.583
how did they get America also?

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.750
They dominated so much, they conquered it,

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.291
they settled down there.

00:37:57.291 --> 00:38:00.834
You saw yesterday, from Sierra Nevada you saw

00:38:00.834 --> 00:38:03.875
how people believed in wisdom and how they lived.

00:38:04.291 --> 00:38:05.750
They took away all their lands.

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:10.625
Everybody, you see, is now nicely the owner of America.

00:38:11.291 --> 00:38:14.041
How? You are squatters.

00:38:14.041 --> 00:38:15.458
You came from another country,

00:38:15.709 --> 00:38:17.375
killed thousands and thousands of people

00:38:17.375 --> 00:38:20.000
without feeling guilty about it.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:22.625
That means they are not even human beings.

00:38:26.291 --> 00:38:28.375
And nicely settled as Americans.

00:38:32.625 --> 00:38:35.625
I don't know how this word 'America' has come,

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.959
but if it means "amar" they are not.

00:38:40.291 --> 00:38:43.291
It means "a mericas" they are not.

00:38:44.166 --> 00:38:46.750
Both ways I don't know how this word has come

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.417
and some sort of a, uh, meaning they attach to it,

00:38:50.834 --> 00:38:56.834
but their intellect grew much more.

00:38:57.125 --> 00:39:00.834
Why? Again, because of money orientation.

00:39:03.083 --> 00:39:05.000
I don't understand economics

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.667
and the way they have made this economics from their,

00:39:08.542 --> 00:39:10.542
yarns which came out of their heads

00:39:10.834 --> 00:39:13.083
has landed all the countries into recession,

00:39:13.333 --> 00:39:16.917
all kinds of fraud and also mafia.

00:39:17.375 --> 00:39:20.917
That is the outcome of this so-called economics they have.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.333
Sahaj economics is very different.

00:39:24.917 --> 00:39:30.250
We are not bound by all these nonsensical ideas

00:39:30.583 --> 00:39:34.000
that are prevalent as economics.

00:39:34.333 --> 00:39:36.834
Is nothing but exploitation.

00:39:37.125 --> 00:39:38.834
Is marketing.

00:39:38.834 --> 00:39:40.458
Is how to impress people,

00:39:40.709 --> 00:39:41.834
how to sell things,

00:39:41.834 --> 00:39:44.333
how to do this, how to do that.

00:39:44.667 --> 00:39:47.667
All this is nothing but, I would say,

00:39:47.667 --> 00:39:50.083
financial aggressiveness.

00:39:54.083 --> 00:39:56.125
What about Shri Krishna?

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.999
He was the king and He lived like a king.

00:40:03.333 --> 00:40:07.125
But also, He lived in a very humble abode

00:40:08.709 --> 00:40:10.458
in Gokul.

00:40:12.333 --> 00:40:14.417
He was not attached.

00:40:16.792 --> 00:40:21.542
So the first thing is that the way they're attached to money,

00:40:22.709 --> 00:40:27.667
any justification for getting money is all right.

00:40:28.083 --> 00:40:31.083
Once we went to a hotel in India.

00:40:32.166 --> 00:40:34.417
So we had some American friends

00:40:34.999 --> 00:40:38.166
and as usual, I mean, you can't eat like Americans can,

00:40:38.166 --> 00:40:40.542
you know. Is, Indians can't compete.

00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:42.834
Can eat a lot.

00:40:43.083 --> 00:40:45.250
So they were eating, eating, eating and,

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.834
but we couldn't cope with them, really, to be very frank,

00:40:47.834 --> 00:40:49.625
I mean, we're no good.

00:40:49.959 --> 00:40:54.750
After some time they said, "Have you finished?" I said, "Yes."

00:40:55.041 --> 00:40:56.875
"All right..." they called the waiter,

00:40:56.875 --> 00:40:59.166
"Pack this out." I said, "What?

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:02.375
Want to pack this for what?" "We paid for it."

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:06.709
"So you paid for it, but I mean...In India nobody will eat a food

00:41:06.999 --> 00:41:08.709
which somebody else has eaten."

00:41:08.959 --> 00:41:10.375
"No, you pack it."

00:41:10.625 --> 00:41:12.542
And they had no shame about it;

00:41:12.834 --> 00:41:14.999
so shameless. I said.

00:41:14.999 --> 00:41:16.750
"We don't do this in India."

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.875
Said, "Why not?" I said,. "These are bad manners."

00:41:18.875 --> 00:41:20.417
"But we've paid for it.

00:41:20.709 --> 00:41:23.291
Once you've paid for it then there is no bad manners."

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:27.417
I said, "Ah, we don't want this to pack."

00:41:27.417 --> 00:41:29.417
"We'll have it. We'll have it in the night.

00:41:29.417 --> 00:41:31.166
We'll have it in the evening."

00:41:31.166 --> 00:41:34.500
I was surprised that such miserly people

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.542
are saying that they are very rich

00:41:36.542 --> 00:41:39.875
and they think no end of themselves; extremely miserly.

00:41:40.375 --> 00:41:43.999
Americans are superficially nice, I must tell you.

00:41:44.417 --> 00:41:47.875
On my experience is they are not like English

00:41:48.083 --> 00:41:50.041
that they look down upon everyone.

00:41:50.041 --> 00:41:51.667
No you don't feel that way with them.

00:41:51.999 --> 00:41:55.500
But they are very superficial.

00:41:55.834 --> 00:41:58.875
You give them ten presents; they won't even give you one.

00:42:01.375 --> 00:42:04.709
They have no sense at all; no shame about it.

00:42:05.166 --> 00:42:09.959
Why? Because the whole thing is, 'we paid for it'.

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:14.875
I mean you go to any place,

00:42:14.875 --> 00:42:18.542
any restaurant there or anything, you'll be amazed.

00:42:19.417 --> 00:42:21.375
They pack things for you

00:42:21.625 --> 00:42:23.709
if something is left over in America.

00:42:23.709 --> 00:42:24.875
They do.

00:42:26.959 --> 00:42:30.417
To that extent they can go in their miserliness

00:42:30.417 --> 00:42:32.875
without any shame about it.

00:42:33.250 --> 00:42:35.667
And miserliness is out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:36.375 --> 00:42:38.041
You cannot be miserly.

00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:40.417
You have to be generous.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:42.709
You have to be giving.

00:42:42.959 --> 00:42:44.625
You have to feel for others.

00:42:45.542 --> 00:42:48.542
Is this the only way we can express ourselves.

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:50.625
All this generosity

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:55.542
is not to create a big sort of a hero out of you.

00:42:57.709 --> 00:43:02.041
But the worst and the worst and the worst is the Hollywood.

00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:09.041
Is the film industry.

00:43:09.291 --> 00:43:12.417
Under the name of industry you can do anything.

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:20.542
Now this Hollywood is creating such horrible films,

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:27.041
but the worst is that they get awards for these worst films.

00:43:27.417 --> 00:43:31.125
There's one film they showed, I've not seen, I can't see it.

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:34.834
They told Me that a man is a cannibal

00:43:35.083 --> 00:43:37.709
and he is eating the flesh of human beings

00:43:37.999 --> 00:43:41.417
and they have shown but they enjoy.

00:43:43.291 --> 00:43:45.709
Very, very famous. Apart from that,

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:49.166
not only famous, but they got awards for the best film,

00:43:49.417 --> 00:43:51.834
the best actor, the best...

00:43:53.166 --> 00:43:55.375
You must get a director from there

00:43:55.625 --> 00:43:58.375
and make him eat the flesh of human beings.

00:43:59.375 --> 00:44:01.834
It's the only way, I think this horrible thing...

00:44:02.125 --> 00:44:04.041
Then they are producing other pictures.

00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:06.291
I've seen another one for a short time

00:44:06.834 --> 00:44:10.417
where they shows all dead bodies hanging you see.

00:44:10.417 --> 00:44:11.875
Horrible!

00:44:14.417 --> 00:44:18.291
Why these people like to see such horrible things?

00:44:19.834 --> 00:44:21.166
What is their character?

00:44:22.083 --> 00:44:23.709
Where have they gone?

00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:28.625
Why do they enjoy things which no human being

00:44:28.625 --> 00:44:31.999
who is a human being will enjoy?

00:44:34.625 --> 00:44:37.166
And then it goes further.

00:44:37.417 --> 00:44:39.542
Their halloween business - I saw a film,

00:44:39.834 --> 00:44:42.834
I said, "My God." This is a hell in which

00:44:43.834 --> 00:44:47.500
they thought it was like the wrath of Shri Krishna.

00:44:49.125 --> 00:44:51.041
So it was Krishna consciousness I think

00:44:51.041 --> 00:44:52.750
that was working there.

00:44:54.041 --> 00:44:57.709
There are thousand and one things which can shock you in America,

00:44:58.166 --> 00:45:02.750
and also in England, also in Europe.

00:45:05.375 --> 00:45:08.041
I thought Austria was something better,

00:45:09.291 --> 00:45:12.000
but in Austria when you walk on the road

00:45:12.375 --> 00:45:14.250
in the night after the program

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:18.125
you must take darshan of many horrible women there on the way.

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:19.959
I mean this is no where...

00:45:19.959 --> 00:45:22.583
you know they're, we're forced into it.

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:27.041
And they can't do anything about it

00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:29.125
as if it's a matter of right, you see,

00:45:29.125 --> 00:45:32.417
what you call that of human right

00:45:32.834 --> 00:45:34.583
to see such women,

00:45:34.834 --> 00:45:37.417
and human right for these women to be on the street.

00:45:37.999 --> 00:45:40.999
All horrible things are happening around,

00:45:41.375 --> 00:45:44.583
so Sahaja Yogis have to equip themselves much more

00:45:44.999 --> 00:45:47.583
with a Shri Krishna's principle.

00:45:47.875 --> 00:45:50.291
The first principle is communication.

00:45:52.166 --> 00:45:55.500
First principle is how you communicate with others.

00:45:55.834 --> 00:45:58.500
Start it at home with your children,

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:00.750
with your wife, with your husband,

00:46:01.041 --> 00:46:03.041
how you communicate.

00:46:03.875 --> 00:46:05.125
Are you gentle?

00:46:05.375 --> 00:46:06.834
Are you kind?

00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:11.834
Are you dominating, aggressive?

00:46:12.166 --> 00:46:14.291
Just try to find out.

00:46:16.875 --> 00:46:19.875
It can go to any limit this aggressiveness,

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:22.125
either of the women or of the men.

00:46:22.125 --> 00:46:25.625
Here more women I must say, I'm sorry to say.

00:46:26.166 --> 00:46:29.125
But in my experience I've seen the women are very dominating.

00:46:29.709 --> 00:46:31.875
In India men are extremely dominating,

00:46:32.125 --> 00:46:35.041
but here I find the women are.

00:46:39.959 --> 00:46:42.834
Now the basics

00:46:44.834 --> 00:46:49.125
as human beings should have good manners.

00:46:52.166 --> 00:46:53.875
I don't find good manners,

00:46:53.875 --> 00:46:57.250
except that they wear good dresses, maybe the...

00:46:57.583 --> 00:47:01.500
they might be wearing those special type of dresses and all that.

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:04.250
All manners are in dresses,

00:47:05.583 --> 00:47:09.709
but when there are people together

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:12.583
they talk nothing but scandal.

00:47:14.875 --> 00:47:18.834
I mean, unbearably, horrible scandals they discuss.

00:47:21.041 --> 00:47:24.500
This is something one has to understand

00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:29.458
that Shri Krishna never talked of scandals.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:34.417
How can this, the country of Shri Krishna

00:47:34.875 --> 00:47:37.125
and all other these European countries

00:47:37.417 --> 00:47:43.750
are just very equipped with all the scandals of the world?

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.583
I just can't understand what is the interest

00:47:48.959 --> 00:47:50.709
people have in the scandals.

00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:54.417
So to top it all is your media

00:47:54.417 --> 00:47:57.875
which is absolutely anti Shri Krishna

00:48:00.291 --> 00:48:02.500
because they have to make money.

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:04.625
It's such a hand in glove business

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.500
that the people like to hear all this nonsense,

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:11.750
so they have scandals in the newspaper.

00:48:12.291 --> 00:48:14.166
At least about thirty years back

00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:17.000
you could never hear such a thing

00:48:19.291 --> 00:48:22.959
and all such books were completely banned.

00:48:24.625 --> 00:48:28.875
And now, suddenly, the whole thing has flowered so well

00:48:29.291 --> 00:48:33.500
that any magazine, anything you take,

00:48:33.959 --> 00:48:36.000
and you can't understand

00:48:36.291 --> 00:48:37.625
what are they preaching.

00:48:37.959 --> 00:48:43.375
They are preaching the cult of destruction completely.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:48.500
And people take it, and like it, and work it out.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:52.000
They are using the women for their own purpose

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.709
and stupidly women accept it.

00:48:56.333 --> 00:48:58.083
Of course they dominate,

00:48:58.083 --> 00:49:00.959
on one side feel very happy that they are dominating.

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:06.208
There was a lady who was boasting in one magazine

00:49:06.458 --> 00:49:09.041
that she has had four hundred men in her life.

00:49:09.041 --> 00:49:11.000
Can you imagine?

00:49:11.875 --> 00:49:14.999
Now there is no place for hell for such a woman even.

00:49:16.333 --> 00:49:18.792
Where will you put such a woman there?

00:49:19.542 --> 00:49:22.166
Now I don't know; that's another problem.

00:49:30.917 --> 00:49:33.667
So this movement,

00:49:34.542 --> 00:49:39.000
which is absolutely against the principle of dharma

00:49:39.625 --> 00:49:42.083
and of communication.

00:49:42.709 --> 00:49:46.000
Now how you must communicate

00:49:46.667 --> 00:49:48.834
decently,

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:50.834
with very tender

00:49:52.834 --> 00:49:57.125
and very beautiful mannerism

00:49:57.458 --> 00:50:01.333
you have to talk to another person,

00:50:01.792 --> 00:50:04.083
talk to other Sahaja Yogis,

00:50:04.542 --> 00:50:06.250
talk to anyone,

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.917
is in a very sweet manner you should talk.

00:50:09.917 --> 00:50:13.166
I do not mean the French style, you see,

00:50:13.166 --> 00:50:17.291
bending your body and all artificial stuff. Not that.

00:50:17.291 --> 00:50:22.375
I'm saying that if you are naturally talking to somebody,

00:50:23.625 --> 00:50:26.375
you should talk with decent language,

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:31.500
with decency, with humility

00:50:32.917 --> 00:50:35.041
and need not go on jabbering all the time

00:50:35.041 --> 00:50:37.625
and talking too much. There's no need.

00:50:38.375 --> 00:50:40.250
But, on the contrary,

00:50:40.583 --> 00:50:42.959
this was the style was Shri Krishna.

00:50:43.166 --> 00:50:46.125
In short, His power was madhurya;

00:50:46.583 --> 00:50:49.500
is the sweetness, like the honey.

00:50:51.291 --> 00:50:54.959
When you are worshiping Shri Krishna

00:50:55.166 --> 00:50:57.834
you have to know that you must talk

00:50:58.166 --> 00:51:02.875
in a manner that will please another person.

00:51:20.041 --> 00:51:23.709
So, while talking to anyone

00:51:23.709 --> 00:51:26.125
you can talk very sweetly,

00:51:26.583 --> 00:51:31.625
very nicely and in a way which will please that person,

00:51:31.625 --> 00:51:33.125
not to provoke,

00:51:33.125 --> 00:51:35.709
not to say things which are hard.

00:51:36.166 --> 00:51:38.166
But some people have a habit

00:51:38.583 --> 00:51:43.250
of saying all the time something which is very provoking,

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.583
which is not at all good.

00:51:47.834 --> 00:51:50.583
But some people are,

00:51:52.458 --> 00:51:56.166
when it comes to their business are very sweet,

00:51:57.125 --> 00:52:00.709
but when it comes to something else they are very harsh.

00:52:01.041 --> 00:52:03.750
We have a Jain community in India.

00:52:04.125 --> 00:52:05.750
I've seen many Jains.

00:52:06.250 --> 00:52:08.375
When they are for their business

00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:10.625
they're the sweetest you could know,

00:52:11.333 --> 00:52:16.959
but when it comes to something else

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:20.125
like donating some money or something,

00:52:20.625 --> 00:52:22.959
they're extremely hard.

00:52:23.458 --> 00:52:26.125
They will only donate for stupid things,

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:29.166
but not for something sensible.

00:52:29.917 --> 00:52:32.709
They'll work for something extremely stupid,

00:52:33.250 --> 00:52:35.834
but never for anything sensible.

00:52:35.834 --> 00:52:39.458
We have another community called as Sindhis.

00:52:39.458 --> 00:52:42.166
I think they are under the influence of the West.

00:52:42.542 --> 00:52:44.917
Same with the Western people.

00:52:45.542 --> 00:52:48.999
If you show that you have some business with them,

00:52:49.999 --> 00:52:52.166
suddenly you know, they change.

00:52:52.542 --> 00:52:54.875
Suddenly they change. You can't understand

00:52:55.083 --> 00:52:57.041
what has happened to this man.

00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:02.083
Or, if they find out you are something in life, they change.

00:53:02.417 --> 00:53:05.500
Shri Krishna was just the other way round.

00:53:05.999 --> 00:53:12.750
In His lifetime, He was always a guest of Vidhura

00:53:13.083 --> 00:53:20.458
who was the son of a Dhasi, is the servant.

00:53:20.458 --> 00:53:24.667
Maidservant's son was Vidhura, but he was a realized soul.

00:53:25.083 --> 00:53:28.208
So He used to go to his house,

00:53:28.625 --> 00:53:32.166
stay in his house, a very humble abode, Vidhura's,

00:53:32.542 --> 00:53:36.208
and eat food there, very simple food.

00:53:36.625 --> 00:53:40.500
But He would not go to the palace of Duryodhana.

00:53:42.208 --> 00:53:44.166
The other way round.

00:53:44.625 --> 00:53:47.291
I mean, somebody thinks that you have a palace,

00:53:47.625 --> 00:53:50.750
they'll be extremely kind to you, very nice, you know.

00:53:51.417 --> 00:53:54.542
But they say he lives in a hut, then he's nothing.

00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:59.542
It's such a money orientation in subtle way.

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:03.917
Shri Krishna never, never cared for money

00:54:04.417 --> 00:54:06.750
and never bothered about it.

00:54:07.625 --> 00:54:10.083
You can see His case

00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:15.750
in which He has shown complete detachment

00:54:16.083 --> 00:54:20.208
about His throne, or His kingdom,

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:23.667
or money part of it.

00:54:24.333 --> 00:54:28.500
Once you are attached you have all the pangs of money.

00:54:29.041 --> 00:54:31.291
Naturally, if you are catching hold of a snake

00:54:31.542 --> 00:54:35.542
you'll always be having the pangs of the snake, don't you?

00:54:35.792 --> 00:54:38.083
But supposing you are detached.

00:54:38.917 --> 00:54:41.875
Then the same money you can use.

00:54:43.333 --> 00:54:45.999
Once you become slave of that money,

00:54:46.291 --> 00:54:48.792
that money sits on your head.

00:54:50.208 --> 00:54:53.999
Now, you know very well that to have money

00:54:54.208 --> 00:54:56.417
also is dangerous these days.

00:54:57.999 --> 00:55:00.417
The whole reaction is building up

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:02.959
and this is where the whole

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:06.166
all the elements are reacting against you.

00:55:07.417 --> 00:55:11.417
You have seen the wisdom of these people from Sierra Nevada,

00:55:11.792 --> 00:55:13.792
and what they said is true

00:55:14.417 --> 00:55:23.083
that when we try to acquire more money,

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.417
go on acquiring, go on acquiring

00:55:27.417 --> 00:55:31.333
and getting a idea in our head,

00:55:32.917 --> 00:55:35.999
then there are looters who come round.

00:55:36.208 --> 00:55:38.125
I think the worst are those

00:55:38.417 --> 00:55:42.417
who have got names as entrepreneurs.

00:55:42.792 --> 00:55:44.999
For example, they'll say, "Now,

00:55:45.208 --> 00:55:48.917
if you have a designer's watch",

00:55:53.083 --> 00:55:56.417
then everybody ran for designer's watches.

00:55:58.417 --> 00:56:03.542
The other day I went to Italy, no, to Istanbul

00:56:03.875 --> 00:56:07.208
and I found out that the T-shirts are made there

00:56:07.542 --> 00:56:10.583
and sold in France as if they are French. They are not.

00:56:10.917 --> 00:56:17.667
They are A to Z, they are made in there, which is Istanbul

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:20.917
and the name is on that Lacoste,

00:56:21.125 --> 00:56:23.000
this that and all that.

00:56:23.333 --> 00:56:26.083
And people pay any amount, but not in Turkey.

00:56:26.333 --> 00:56:31.208
Whatever surplus is left we can get it for seven pounds.

00:56:32.542 --> 00:56:36.542
Now the stupidity is that they can befool you.

00:56:38.667 --> 00:56:41.667
Pierre Cardin, then there's another one,

00:56:42.125 --> 00:56:45.917
I don't know, Armani - that's in Italy only,

00:56:46.125 --> 00:56:48.458
but in America there are many.

00:56:48.709 --> 00:56:51.458
Even, I mean, they come to you,

00:56:51.709 --> 00:56:52.834
to your house.

00:56:52.834 --> 00:56:54.583
England is much worse.

00:56:54.917 --> 00:56:56.250
They're so unmannerly,

00:56:56.542 --> 00:56:58.375
they'll come to your house for dinner

00:56:58.792 --> 00:57:02.375
and they'll turn the plate to see where it is made.

00:57:03.417 --> 00:57:05.375
Really. Openly.

00:57:05.834 --> 00:57:09.667
And they'll discuss from where the cutlery has come.

00:57:13.083 --> 00:57:16.583
So, though they think they're very rich,

00:57:16.583 --> 00:57:20.458
stupidly they are being exploited by this kind of a nonsense

00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:24.542
that you have this watch, you have this thing.

00:57:24.917 --> 00:57:28.458
Now, in England we have something called Saville Row,

00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:31.834
so that they put it outside, you know,

00:57:31.834 --> 00:57:34.542
outside the coat - Saville Row.

00:57:34.542 --> 00:57:36.583
Can you imagine?

00:57:36.834 --> 00:57:38.458
Branded.

00:57:38.917 --> 00:57:43.333
See, everything is made into a big ado.

00:57:43.792 --> 00:57:45.999
So on one side they are very intelligent

00:57:46.208 --> 00:57:48.375
to understand this is the business,

00:57:48.375 --> 00:57:52.000
this is the fashion all that.

00:57:52.333 --> 00:57:55.083
The other side they don't know they are fools,

00:57:55.583 --> 00:57:57.792
being befooled all the time by saying

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000
this is the special thing, that is the special thing

00:58:01.375 --> 00:58:05.125
and that it has a name and it has, what you call,

00:58:05.542 --> 00:58:09.667
the - a great organization behind it.

00:58:12.250 --> 00:58:15.458
Sahaja Yogis should understand this is all befooling

00:58:15.917 --> 00:58:19.250
and stupid thing and they wear,

00:58:19.542 --> 00:58:21.999
all of them will wear like that just to show off.

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.583
What is it?

00:58:24.583 --> 00:58:28.333
Why should this impress anyone?

00:58:28.917 --> 00:58:30.709
Think of it.

00:58:31.083 --> 00:58:34.834
Now, intelligently think why should it impress you,

00:58:35.375 --> 00:58:37.917
these befooling things that are going on?

00:58:38.125 --> 00:58:39.125
Nothing special.

00:58:39.125 --> 00:58:41.458
They are just the same.

00:58:41.792 --> 00:58:46.208
They told Me in Istanbul that they make ordinary ones

00:58:46.458 --> 00:58:48.792
and then they put on top of this mark

00:58:49.083 --> 00:58:52.458
and the ordinary ones are for, say,

00:58:52.709 --> 00:58:56.583
six dollars, so with this thing is for seven dollars.

00:58:58.917 --> 00:59:00.999
There's nothing special,

00:59:02.125 --> 00:59:06.125
but this special trickery, I think,

00:59:06.125 --> 00:59:10.583
is coming from England and America especially

00:59:11.250 --> 00:59:15.709
maybe also from France, but France are, you know,

00:59:15.709 --> 00:59:17.208
queer people.

00:59:17.667 --> 00:59:20.792
Now they have something. I showed them today -

00:59:21.208 --> 00:59:24.458
So stupidly made thing,

00:59:24.792 --> 00:59:27.917
which cost five hundred pounds,

00:59:28.375 --> 00:59:32.250
but people accept because they have no wisdom.

00:59:32.834 --> 00:59:37.333
Now see the difference between the intelligence and wisdom.

00:59:39.083 --> 00:59:41.709
Why to show off, first of all

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.542
and to show off something which has no meaning?

00:59:44.834 --> 00:59:51.542
It cost only one dollar in Turkey to put that thing on

00:59:51.542 --> 00:59:54.583
and stupidly people are showing it.

00:59:58.792 --> 01:00:04.125
Is it that we have intelligence,

01:00:05.208 --> 01:00:07.458
but which has no divine power?

01:00:07.792 --> 01:00:11.333
Anybody can befool you to do what you like.

01:00:11.709 --> 01:00:13.709
Now six inches of skirt started.

01:00:13.709 --> 01:00:15.542
All right, everywhere six inches.

01:00:15.792 --> 01:00:18.667
You couldn't get one with the seven inches even.

01:00:19.333 --> 01:00:21.000
That's not in the fashion.

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:24.208
That's not in - means 'in' in madhouse?

01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:31.709
Now just look at Shri Krishna's style - so wise,

01:00:32.583 --> 01:00:34.333
witnessing everything,

01:00:34.667 --> 01:00:36.709
how He plays around

01:00:38.417 --> 01:00:40.458
and how He wins over.

01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:43.583
Now, supposing He was attached.

01:00:43.583 --> 01:00:46.333
He could not have done it.

01:00:48.083 --> 01:00:51.917
So to get over this, first of all, you detach yourself from this

01:00:52.208 --> 01:00:54.999
anti-Shri Krishna culture.

01:00:54.999 --> 01:00:57.125
It's very important.

01:00:58.417 --> 01:01:00.834
This is the fashion. That is the fashion.

01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:06.333
And all these fashions are extremely, extremely destructive.

01:01:06.583 --> 01:01:09.333
Now, not to put oil in the hair

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:13.208
and end up with bald heads. All right.

01:01:13.542 --> 01:01:15.542
Then there are specialists, you see,

01:01:15.542 --> 01:01:19.583
again designers who make wigs, designer's wig.

01:01:19.834 --> 01:01:23.125
So you carry a wig on your head and write it down, 'designer's.'

01:01:28.208 --> 01:01:30.333
My idea is to see

01:01:30.792 --> 01:01:36.250
how stupid human beings can become with their intellect.

01:01:38.250 --> 01:01:42.999
Today I don't want to describe the qualities of Shri Krishna

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:45.125
because you know them.

01:01:46.208 --> 01:01:49.125
But how you people have gone away,

01:01:49.583 --> 01:01:55.083
in the West, from Shri Krishna's styles,

01:01:55.333 --> 01:01:57.125
His methods.

01:01:57.709 --> 01:02:00.709
Whatever He did was to destroy the evil,

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:03.875
to destroy the negativity

01:02:04.208 --> 01:02:06.917
and to bring forth the joy,

01:02:07.542 --> 01:02:11.999
which is Ras, He started. "Ras" - Ra is energy with that.

01:02:12.583 --> 01:02:15.125
The Ras is the energy,

01:02:15.458 --> 01:02:18.999
which you have

01:02:19.583 --> 01:02:22.709
and that's how you play the Ras,

01:02:22.999 --> 01:02:24.917
with that energy and enjoy.

01:02:25.125 --> 01:02:26.583
He brought it Holi.

01:02:26.583 --> 01:02:28.542
Of course now "Holi" can be anything,

01:02:28.792 --> 01:02:34.417
but very sensible Holy he brought just to express your joy

01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:37.083
in mirthful, playful ways,

01:02:37.458 --> 01:02:41.125
because that was lacking in Shri Rama's life.

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:44.917
So He said just allow yourself to enjoy,

01:02:44.917 --> 01:02:49.250
but this was only for Sahaja Yogis.

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:51.583
Not for others.

01:02:51.583 --> 01:02:55.834
Others, you know that they go to the pubs

01:02:55.834 --> 01:02:58.667
and what happens. We have a certificate here that

01:02:58.667 --> 01:03:02.583
we are very peaceful, very good people, this and that.

01:03:02.875 --> 01:03:05.417
This is what Shri Krishna said

01:03:05.875 --> 01:03:07.417
and has done,

01:03:07.875 --> 01:03:10.709
that we have to enjoy everything,

01:03:11.041 --> 01:03:13.417
but in a dharmic way.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.291
We should not be adharmic.

01:03:17.166 --> 01:03:19.625
The Dharma should give you Joy.

01:03:19.875 --> 01:03:22.417
Otherwise, if you are dharmic, you know what happens,

01:03:22.709 --> 01:03:25.041
that you become absolutely austere,

01:03:27.417 --> 01:03:29.542
person, joyless person

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:34.542
and sometimes cynical

01:03:35.083 --> 01:03:37.750
because you think others are adharmic and this and that.

01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:41.875
But Shri Krishna's ways were that you should be mirthful,

01:03:41.875 --> 01:03:43.542
you should be joyful

01:03:43.542 --> 01:03:46.875
and this joy will communicate with others.

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:53.959
Without this joyous nature you cannot be communicator.

01:03:54.625 --> 01:03:56.750
But, as you know, when I went to French,

01:03:57.041 --> 01:03:58.834
they told Me, "Mother, you look so joyous,

01:03:59.041 --> 01:04:00.875
you should tell you are miserable."

01:04:01.083 --> 01:04:02.667
I said, "But I am not."

01:04:02.667 --> 01:04:04.999
"If you don't tell, then they won't believe you."

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:07.083
I said, "Why?" "Because they are all miserable

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.500
and they think they are very unhappy people."

01:04:11.291 --> 01:04:14.625
So I started my lecture with "Les Miserables"

01:04:15.083 --> 01:04:19.625
and I told them that at every fourth lamppost

01:04:20.041 --> 01:04:24.375
you find a prostitute and every tenth one a pub.

01:04:25.542 --> 01:04:30.375
And I see so many people sitting on the pavement,

01:04:30.625 --> 01:04:32.834
so I asked them, "Why are they sitting here?"

01:04:32.834 --> 01:04:35.041
Said, "They are waiting the whole world to be destroyed."

01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:38.959
I said, "Really?" After drinking, these ideas come in,

01:04:39.166 --> 01:04:40.792
that let the whole world be destroyed

01:04:40.792 --> 01:04:43.875
because maybe they don't have any more money to go to pubs.

01:04:43.875 --> 01:04:45.625
I don't know why.

01:04:47.041 --> 01:04:49.500
Now, think their level,

01:04:49.999 --> 01:04:52.166
just think of their level.

01:04:52.959 --> 01:04:54.500
Where are they

01:04:56.959 --> 01:04:58.500
compared to you all?

01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:03.959
So He's the one, as Virata,

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:06.417
puts light into your brain.

01:05:08.625 --> 01:05:11.875
In that light you see what is stupid;

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:13.959
what is unwise.

01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:17.041
This is the blessing of Shri Krishna.

01:05:18.667 --> 01:05:23.750
And He gives you the nirananda

01:05:24.041 --> 01:05:27.959
because if you don't have the light you cannot enjoy

01:05:29.417 --> 01:05:33.792
the joy of your mind

01:05:34.083 --> 01:05:36.333
or the joy of your brain.

01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:37.959
You cannot.

01:05:38.875 --> 01:05:42.208
And it is through His light

01:05:42.792 --> 01:05:44.417
that we see

01:05:46.417 --> 01:05:51.417
ourselves as something full of joy

01:05:51.417 --> 01:05:53.999
and we don't know what to do with it

01:05:56.166 --> 01:05:57.750
and how to do it;

01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:59.792
how to express our joy;

01:06:00.166 --> 01:06:02.625
how to express our feelings.

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:05.166
Because it's too much.

01:06:05.166 --> 01:06:08.792
This another fashion to say, "It's too much."

01:06:09.875 --> 01:06:12.542
Anything you tell them," Mother,it is too much."

01:06:12.542 --> 01:06:15.583
Because the brain is full of nonsense,

01:06:15.834 --> 01:06:18.250
so you tell them anything, nothing can go in their heads.

01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:20.125
"It's too much."

01:06:21.792 --> 01:06:24.458
So the wise person,

01:06:25.125 --> 01:06:27.208
as Shri Krishna is,

01:06:27.709 --> 01:06:29.542
wisest of wise,

01:06:29.999 --> 01:06:32.125
He's the source of wisdom,

01:06:32.792 --> 01:06:35.250
has to be Stitha Pragya.

01:06:36.333 --> 01:06:38.999
Means he has to be in balance,

01:06:39.333 --> 01:06:41.583
he has to be in dharma

01:06:45.125 --> 01:06:48.792
and, above that,

01:06:49.125 --> 01:06:52.000
he has to be in Joy.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.250
Now, you are not only in joy, but you know the truth.

01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:59.417
You know the absolute truth.

01:07:01.667 --> 01:07:03.834
And this absolute truth

01:07:04.083 --> 01:07:08.667
is the one that makes you understand

01:07:09.709 --> 01:07:13.542
what is right, what is wrong and you develop your wisdom,

01:07:14.083 --> 01:07:16.333
not your intellect so much.

01:07:17.083 --> 01:07:19.834
You then see your intellect misbehaving sometimes,

01:07:20.083 --> 01:07:21.417
telling you negative ideas,

01:07:21.417 --> 01:07:23.709
sometimes too much of aggressive ideas.

01:07:23.709 --> 01:07:26.792
You can become a witness, "sakshi",

01:07:27.041 --> 01:07:28.375
and that's why Shri Krishna has said,

01:07:28.375 --> 01:07:31.250
"I am the sakshi of the whole world,

01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:33.583
the witness of the whole world."

01:07:34.208 --> 01:07:36.709
See, you can go on talking about Him,

01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:41.041
but what we have to see, where are we going wrong

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:44.834
and how can Shri Krishna save us?

01:07:45.333 --> 01:07:48.917
Not by singing, "Hari Rama, Hari Krishna", like that.

01:07:51.709 --> 01:07:56.250
By becoming, day by day, wiser person.

01:07:58.709 --> 01:08:04.959
Wisdom gives you definite ideas as to how you have to be.

01:08:05.792 --> 01:08:08.458
If there is still this thing going on.

01:08:08.458 --> 01:08:11.750
See, in the Western way they show like this.

01:08:11.999 --> 01:08:13.083
Ask them, "How are you?"

01:08:13.083 --> 01:08:15.291
"I'm like this." Means what?

01:08:16.083 --> 01:08:17.417
"Like this."

01:08:17.417 --> 01:08:19.417
If that is still there,

01:08:19.417 --> 01:08:21.875
then Shri Krishna is not awakened,

01:08:23.166 --> 01:08:26.959
but if it is that you know what it is,

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:31.083
you'll have the same smile as Shri Krishna had.

01:08:31.625 --> 01:08:35.208
I know. I know that.

01:08:37.208 --> 01:08:40.792
Now we have to understand that our Vishuddhi

01:08:41.041 --> 01:08:42.959
has to be all right.

01:08:43.166 --> 01:08:45.959
I get Vishuddhi because I know what it is.

01:08:45.959 --> 01:08:47.291
This is America, should be all right,

01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:50.542
otherwise My Vishuddhi will never be all right. I think so.

01:08:51.959 --> 01:08:53.667
But for Vishuddhi,

01:08:54.041 --> 01:08:56.333
there are so many things we have in Sahaja Yoga

01:08:56.625 --> 01:08:58.542
which very few people do.

01:08:58.875 --> 01:09:01.333
At least if you Sahaja Yogis keep your Vishuddhi all right,

01:09:01.625 --> 01:09:03.667
I'll be much better off.

01:09:04.083 --> 01:09:06.875
But you never try to keep your Vishuddhi all right.

01:09:06.875 --> 01:09:09.166
Continue with it. Continue with it.

01:09:09.417 --> 01:09:10.875
Even the president of America

01:09:11.083 --> 01:09:14.166
has the worst Vishuddhi I've ever seen,

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:16.999
so you can imagine what good is he going to do.

01:09:18.291 --> 01:09:21.500
What wisdom will he have?

01:09:23.291 --> 01:09:26.083
Now you are a new race,

01:09:26.417 --> 01:09:30.166
blessed by the Divine,

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:33.625
and you have Shri Krishna within yourself awakened.

01:09:34.208 --> 01:09:39.083
In His own glory, in His own light,

01:09:39.999 --> 01:09:42.750
you should know what is to be done.

01:09:44.166 --> 01:09:46.333
One must communicate.

01:09:46.792 --> 01:09:48.083
That you have to do,

01:09:48.333 --> 01:09:51.667
but what I've seen that people don't even meditate.

01:09:51.959 --> 01:09:53.208
Even if they meditate,

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:54.792
they don't want to communicate.

01:09:55.083 --> 01:09:56.875
And sometimes when they communicate,

01:09:57.166 --> 01:09:59.417
they think they have become Gods.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.041
It's very difficult.

01:10:02.417 --> 01:10:05.417
Human beings is very

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:09.792
difficult commodity to handle.

01:10:10.875 --> 01:10:14.208
You have to communicate with complete humility

01:10:15.458 --> 01:10:17.750
the way Shri Krishna did.

01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:19.333
In His ras,

01:10:19.667 --> 01:10:22.625
He spread the energy of Radha

01:10:23.208 --> 01:10:26.625
into all these people by holding hands.

01:10:27.291 --> 01:10:30.750
So His childhood where He killed so many people

01:10:30.999 --> 01:10:33.291
and did all that is over.

01:10:33.625 --> 01:10:36.208
Then even His adulthood,

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:40.291
where He had to kill His own uncle, is also over.

01:10:40.875 --> 01:10:43.166
So He becomes the king.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:48.417
When He becomes the king then what does He do?

01:10:48.667 --> 01:10:50.542
Is to communicate.

01:10:50.999 --> 01:10:52.500
Most of His,

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:56.542
expressions of His qualities

01:10:56.542 --> 01:11:00.166
are seen after He became the king.

01:11:00.417 --> 01:11:03.083
Before that He was busy killing,

01:11:03.333 --> 01:11:05.875
one after another, all these horrible people.

01:11:06.208 --> 01:11:08.625
After that He built,

01:11:09.417 --> 01:11:10.542
built up people.

01:11:10.542 --> 01:11:13.291
He built Dwarika and

01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:17.667
He tried to communicate

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:20.542
with people.

01:11:20.792 --> 01:11:23.542
Now your duty is to build up yourself

01:11:23.542 --> 01:11:25.667
and to communicate with others

01:11:26.333 --> 01:11:30.166
with all the sweetness, madhurya of Shri Krishna,

01:11:30.417 --> 01:11:32.792
all the beauty of Shri Krishna,

01:11:33.625 --> 01:11:35.667
with full understanding

01:11:35.917 --> 01:11:38.875
as to what stupid things are going round and around.

01:11:40.041 --> 01:11:42.417
Once you understand that,

01:11:43.291 --> 01:11:45.625
you'll not take it because you will become wise

01:11:45.917 --> 01:11:48.792
enough not to take to all these nonsensical things

01:11:49.083 --> 01:11:50.500
that are going on.

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:51.750
And it is so much,

01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:54.208
I mean, I, in this lecture, I cannot tell you,

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.750
but now if you become the witness of the whole thing

01:11:56.999 --> 01:11:58.750
you'll see what is happening.

01:11:58.999 --> 01:12:03.625
Now we have to stop them from going to Hell.

01:12:04.417 --> 01:12:11.166
And we have to really develop a very, very good personality

01:12:11.166 --> 01:12:13.542
of a Sahaja Yogi. All of you.

01:12:13.959 --> 01:12:16.625
Now, there are many marriages that take place,

01:12:16.959 --> 01:12:18.875
then suddenly they decide to divorce.

01:12:18.875 --> 01:12:20.792
Divorce is allowed in Sahaja Yoga,

01:12:21.083 --> 01:12:23.625
but this American style of nonsense

01:12:23.875 --> 01:12:25.750
I don't want to have.

01:12:27.083 --> 01:12:29.208
Women are can be very dominating.

01:12:29.208 --> 01:12:31.625
One fellow ran away to Russia.

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.542
They have no idea of a marriage.

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:37.041
They don't know how to work it out.

01:12:37.333 --> 01:12:39.792
All the sweetness of the marriage is finished.

01:12:39.792 --> 01:12:41.083
If the husband is dominating,

01:12:41.083 --> 01:12:42.542
the wife is dominating,

01:12:42.542 --> 01:12:44.333
this happens, then you divorce.

01:12:44.333 --> 01:12:47.041
What is the achievement?

01:12:49.041 --> 01:12:51.041
So we have to work out

01:12:51.542 --> 01:12:54.166
everything within us because we are conditioned,

01:12:54.166 --> 01:12:55.917
we are in an atmosphere.

01:12:56.333 --> 01:12:58.166
I would request all of you

01:12:59.291 --> 01:13:01.500
to try to understand these subtleties

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:05.333
of Shri Krishna's personality.

01:13:05.333 --> 01:13:07.417
Try to become like that

01:13:07.667 --> 01:13:09.166
extremely peaceful,

01:13:10.333 --> 01:13:14.333
extremely kind, tender, helpful.

01:13:15.208 --> 01:13:17.083
And in humility,

01:13:17.333 --> 01:13:19.500
He had no consciousness of money.

01:13:20.083 --> 01:13:21.750
Nothing.

01:13:22.083 --> 01:13:25.291
And also, as you know, He was a dark person

01:13:28.041 --> 01:13:29.959
for some reason,

01:13:30.999 --> 01:13:34.041
but the way He led his life

01:13:34.417 --> 01:13:36.291
should be an example for us.

01:13:38.041 --> 01:13:42.875
I'm sure, now, when you go back to your countries

01:13:43.208 --> 01:13:44.750
you'll see all this nonsense.

01:13:44.999 --> 01:13:46.291
Please note it down.

01:13:46.542 --> 01:13:49.083
Write it down what these nonsensical people are doing

01:13:49.083 --> 01:13:51.208
and send it over to Me.

01:13:52.083 --> 01:13:53.792
That's what it is.

01:13:53.792 --> 01:13:57.083
So today is the puja of Shri Krishna.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:00.875
I need not tell you how many qualities He has, as I told you,

01:14:01.333 --> 01:14:04.500
but the greatest quality He has that

01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:09.333
He is the doctor of doctors.

01:14:13.166 --> 01:14:16.542
Now, in His name you will know how many qualities He has

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:19.208
and you will understand.

01:14:19.208 --> 01:14:20.667
Try to understand that

01:14:20.667 --> 01:14:23.208
we have to have these qualities within us also.

01:14:23.542 --> 01:14:25.750
Whatever qualities are described or said,

01:14:25.999 --> 01:14:28.333
try to see how many we have.

01:14:29.208 --> 01:14:31.875
That's the way the introspection will start.

01:14:31.875 --> 01:14:34.083
Once you start introspecting yourself

01:14:34.333 --> 01:14:36.083
and understanding yourself,

01:14:36.083 --> 01:14:39.500
the wisdom will grow - not by seeing faults in others,

01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:42.999
putting blames on others, but on yourself.

01:14:43.208 --> 01:14:46.166
That is how the things will work out.

01:14:46.417 --> 01:14:48.500
Though Krishna didn't have to do that because

01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:50.875
He was Sampurna, He was complete.

01:14:50.875 --> 01:14:52.583
But we have to do all this

01:14:52.583 --> 01:14:55.375
to see that we also become complete.

01:14:55.375 --> 01:14:56.959
Thank you very much.

01:14:57.959 --> 01:15:00.041
May God bless you all.

01:15:07.917 --> 01:15:09.750
May God bless you.

01:15:13.125 --> 01:15:17.291
There's another point I wanted to mention about Sahaja Yogis,

01:15:17.959 --> 01:15:22.750
that we introduce classical Indian music for you people,

01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:27.375
because I think it helps for vibrations.

01:15:28.375 --> 01:15:30.750
But as the nature is of western people,

01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:35.583
anything they take up they must go to the utilmate end

01:15:35.917 --> 01:15:38.458
'til they are completely lost.

01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:45.583
So what I find now all of them are buying tapes.

01:15:46.999 --> 01:15:50.417
Some tapes ...

01:16:04.959 --> 01:16:09.667
Now some of them are buying tapes, I was surprised,

01:16:09.667 --> 01:16:13.166
of very unknown people, just mad.

01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:17.834
Once I was traveling with a lady in America,

01:16:18.083 --> 01:16:20.083
was a disciple of Muktanand.

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:24.417
She said, "I have a very nice tape," and she played the,

01:16:24.417 --> 01:16:25.999
the, lecture of Muktanand.

01:16:25.999 --> 01:16:30.166
Rajneesh's people will play the lecture of Rajneesh.

01:16:30.625 --> 01:16:33.750
But here now they've all gone to one side,

01:16:34.041 --> 01:16:35.375
so this one, that one,

01:16:35.875 --> 01:16:39.083
all kinds of music they have got.

01:16:39.875 --> 01:16:41.625
Tomorrow, we start

01:16:42.667 --> 01:16:45.999
telling you that you must understand Indian dancing,

01:16:46.417 --> 01:16:49.834
so all my videos will be replaced by Indian dancing

01:16:49.834 --> 01:16:51.542
from A to Z.

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:55.417
You are Sahaja Yogis.

01:16:55.834 --> 01:16:58.959
It's all right, I am also fond of music,

01:16:59.250 --> 01:17:00.750
but it's not the way.

01:17:00.999 --> 01:17:03.500
What is the main thing of your life?

01:17:04.375 --> 01:17:08.083
And I was surprised how people are lost in the music.

01:17:09.999 --> 01:17:12.959
I mean there should be some occasion.

01:17:13.959 --> 01:17:17.999
They're all already in another world with the music.

01:17:18.834 --> 01:17:20.166
Don't do these things.

01:17:20.417 --> 01:17:22.959
You go to extremes of everything.

01:17:23.250 --> 01:17:25.667
That's not proper, even pujas, anything,

01:17:25.667 --> 01:17:27.375
you go to extremes.

01:17:27.375 --> 01:17:29.999
To go to extremes, you won't be in the center.

01:17:30.375 --> 01:17:34.875
You will not be in the place of Shri Krishna,

01:17:35.166 --> 01:17:37.250
where you have to be.

01:17:37.542 --> 01:17:39.709
On the contrary, you will be

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:43.375
just in another imaginary world.

01:17:45.291 --> 01:17:50.959
So, as a matter of habit we create a world like that;

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:52.500
somebody has music world;

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:54.250
somebody has dancing world;

01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.083
another one has,

01:17:58.875 --> 01:18:02.417
world, I've seen with Sahaja Yogis who think

01:18:02.834 --> 01:18:04.625
no end of themselves.

01:18:04.875 --> 01:18:07.291
"We have a special relationship with Shri Mataji."

01:18:07.291 --> 01:18:08.959
Is a very common thing.

01:18:09.166 --> 01:18:11.959
But I cannot have any special relationship.

01:18:13.083 --> 01:18:14.166
Sorry,

01:18:17.166 --> 01:18:20.834
nobody has any special relationship with Me.

01:18:21.291 --> 01:18:24.166
This I would like to tell you very clearly,

01:18:24.750 --> 01:18:26.709
and you should not claim that,

01:18:27.083 --> 01:18:29.417
and then become, some people say, "we are deities."

01:18:29.417 --> 01:18:32.959
I mean this is something to be - horrible.

01:18:34.041 --> 01:18:38.041
I'll speak for two minutes in Marathi if you don't mind...

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.166
Now I want to talk to the Maharashtrian girls.

01:18:42.083 --> 01:18:43.917
You have been married here,

01:18:43.917 --> 01:18:46.000
and have got rich husbands.

01:18:47.417 --> 01:18:48.458
But as soon as you came here

01:18:48.999 --> 01:18:51.959
you've started sending money to your parents.

01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:54.208
Does this happen in India?

01:18:54.208 --> 01:18:56.583
Can you send money to your parents from your in laws' house.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.875
Secondly is ornaments.

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:01.792
You've started making a lot of ornaments.

01:19:02.208 --> 01:19:03.875
I asked a Sahaja yogi husband

01:19:04.417 --> 01:19:06.208
why don't you buy a shirt for yourself.

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:07.250
He said, "what should I do,

01:19:07.583 --> 01:19:09.291
my wife is spending all the money on ornaments."

01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:15.166
This greed for ornaments does not behove a Sahaja Yogi.

01:19:19.917 --> 01:19:22.083
This is a very serious matter.

01:19:22.458 --> 01:19:25.291
Recently I learnt that all the Indian ladies

01:19:25.291 --> 01:19:29.250
have made ornaments after marriage.

01:19:31.458 --> 01:19:33.542
Thus there is no money left with the husband.

01:19:33.834 --> 01:19:35.875
Those husbands who used to support Sahaja yoga before

01:19:36.208 --> 01:19:37.375
are unable to do so after the marriage.

01:19:37.667 --> 01:19:40.333
They have no money left with them.

01:19:40.667 --> 01:19:41.542
What has happened to you.

01:19:41.542 --> 01:19:44.125
you've come here from the land of saints.

01:19:44.917 --> 01:19:51.625
Shivaji Maharaj had a great respect for Shri Saint Tukaram

01:19:51.917 --> 01:19:54.875
and he took some ornaments for his wife.

01:19:56.959 --> 01:19:59.166
His wife must be somebody like you,

01:19:59.417 --> 01:20:02.291
as she immediately accepted the ornaments.

01:20:02.291 --> 01:20:06.250
Why should one be so much fond of ornaments?

01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:07.417
Even being a Goddess I am not fond of ornaments,

01:20:07.875 --> 01:20:10.083
then why should you be so fond of them?

01:20:11.959 --> 01:20:15.333
Since they compulsorily offer me that's why I accept.

01:20:15.792 --> 01:20:22.625
So he gave and she accepted the ornaments,

01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:24.250
Saint Tukaram came and said,

01:20:25.291 --> 01:20:28.125
"What is the need to have the ornaments for saints like us?"

01:20:28.542 --> 01:20:32.750
So he returned back all the ornaments.

01:20:33.083 --> 01:20:36.542
Know that you've come here from land of saints

01:20:37.083 --> 01:20:40.667
and this attitude of yours is a sign of poorness.

01:20:40.667 --> 01:20:42.500
You've been sending money to your parents

01:20:42.875 --> 01:20:48.166
and I cannot explain to you how far this has gone.

01:20:55.583 --> 01:20:59.291
You've not come here to misbehave like this.

01:20:59.291 --> 01:21:01.458
You've come here to help Sahaja Yoga

01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:07.333
and not for making ornaments.

01:21:07.333 --> 01:21:09.542
If you do them once in a while it's all right

01:21:11.834 --> 01:21:15.250
but if you put all the attention on ornaments

01:21:16.291 --> 01:21:18.583
you might lose your husband and he might leave Sahaja Yoga.

01:21:18.917 --> 01:21:21.875
This would be good deed (meant not good), you will achieve!!

01:21:23.542 --> 01:21:24.500
Without My permission henceforth,

01:21:24.792 --> 01:21:26.959
nobody should make any ornaments.

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:42.333
We'll have the Pooja now.
