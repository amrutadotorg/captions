00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:11.734
Today, we are going to worship the Goddess.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.400
That’s the, first the left side programming is with Her,

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:25.400
but later on, at Sahasrara, She’s the Adi Shakti.

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:31.367
And, on the left side, whatever She does
is already written, as you must have seen,

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:34.367
because She’s the memory

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.234
and that She’s the wisdom and,

00:00:47.534 --> 00:01:01.634
that She protects you, is shown when
She uses Her power over the Ganas.

00:01:01.803 --> 00:01:07.836
So, as you worship the Goddess,
you are also worshipping Shri Ganesha

00:01:07.936 --> 00:01:11.970
who is the power behind Her.

00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:23.070
But the greatest power that is
belonging to the Mother is your protection,

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.936
protection from all kinds of things.

00:01:27.037 --> 00:01:32.070
All the left hand side protections are there.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.970
They are described, as you must have learned,

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.770
in the Devi Mahatmyam, what a protections She gives you.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.970
So tremendous in Her protecting power,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.836
and this protecting power gives you understanding:

00:01:51.936 --> 00:01:57.536
how kind She is and how,

00:02:03.303 --> 00:02:11.669
I should say, how very, very
protective of you, extremely protective.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.669
She’ll guide you all the time that you should be protected,

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:26.970
on the left side, and through Her Ganas She looks after you.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.303
But on the right side also, those who are on the right side,

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:40.237
the Goddess puts Her powers to put you right,

00:02:40.337 --> 00:02:44.569
to bring you back to normal conditions,

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:52.137
to humble you down and make you understand that

00:02:52.237 --> 00:02:59.822
you are a child of the Mother
and you have to behave like a child.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.769
So the protection is also built-in your body

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:15.136
by Ganas on the left hand side and
by reactions on the right hand side.

00:03:15.236 --> 00:03:20.170
But the greatest thing is the blessings of the Mother:

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.069
the way She looks after you, the way She loves you

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.069
and the way She cares for you – which
you should never take it for granted!

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.869
You must meditate, you must meditate, it’s very important.

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:42.403
No question! Without meditation
you can[not] keep yourself alright.

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.370
it’s no question.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.470
Meditation is the most important thing which must be followed

00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:55.969
because that’s how you come close to Her vibrations,

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:02.170
come to Her – I should say to Her nature.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.836
Even animals are so sensitive to
Mother, very sensitive to vibrations.

00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:12.470
Animals are, but human beings have their own understanding,

00:04:12.736 --> 00:04:20.069
have their own freedom, have their so-called intelligence

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:28.003
and they fall a trap to it; they follow
things which they should not have.

00:04:28.103 --> 00:04:32.836
So what is necessary very much, in the country like America,

00:04:32.936 --> 00:04:37.036
is the devotion and bhakti.

00:04:37.136 --> 00:04:39.702
These two things are not there.

00:04:39.802 --> 00:04:43.470
Indians take to Sahaja Yoga and go deep down into it

00:04:43.736 --> 00:04:47.370
because they know what is bhakti, what is devotion.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.036
All this ego and all that melts away.

00:04:51.136 --> 00:04:54.136
But this bhakti is to be enjoyed.

00:04:54.236 --> 00:04:59.802
I don’t know how to create bhakti within you – that I can’t say.

00:04:59.903 --> 00:05:04.069
But I have seen people with bhakti,

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.136
they have achieved great heights,
though it’s a left side movement.

00:05:09.236 --> 00:05:13.236
With the left side movement they have achieved great heights.

00:05:13.336 --> 00:05:19.802
I don’t know how the bhakti (devotion) and
shraddha (faith) has helped them so much.

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:25.069
In this, I must say, Indians are the best

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:31.702
because they have this power of bhakti and of shraddha.

00:05:31.802 --> 00:05:35.869
It’s not madness, it’s not madness as they have here:

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:41.802
I have seen people who get into some
sort of a cult or something, they go mad.

00:05:41.903 --> 00:05:48.270
It’s not madness, bhakti is love,
and love which is understanding,

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.370
which understands what is bhakti and shraddha.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.869
Unless and until you develop
that bhakti and shraddha within you,

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:04.769
you cannot rise, you cannot rise above your problems,

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:11.769
you cannot rise above your personality because

00:06:14.303 --> 00:06:22.869
bhakti is something you cannot impose
on anyone, you cannot force on anybody.

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:30.936
You can make somebody mad and
say that he can do bhakti, [but] he cannot.

00:06:31.036 --> 00:06:38.802
You have to have all your qualities absolutely intact:

00:06:38.903 --> 00:06:44.336
you should be intelligent, you should be
understanding – everything should be there,

00:06:44.436 --> 00:06:50.069
but at that time the joy of bhakti is within you.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.702
And this joy of bhakti when it starts flowing,

00:06:54.802 --> 00:07:00.336
the Goddess Herself enters into your being, I should say.

00:07:00.436 --> 00:07:05.036
I have seen people, bhaktas, many great saints in India

00:07:05.136 --> 00:07:10.669
who achieved a lot of height. They’ve gone too far into it.

00:07:10.769 --> 00:07:17.436
And if you read about them and, if you understand them,

00:07:17.702 --> 00:07:23.470
you are amazed how, without any help, without any guidance,

00:07:23.736 --> 00:07:29.003
how could they go that deep and worship Devi.

00:07:29.103 --> 00:07:33.802
Worshipping is not just out of sheer reading

00:07:33.903 --> 00:07:37.236
or some sort of a chanting or anything,

00:07:37.336 --> 00:07:45.403
but it’s the deep attention of your heart;

00:07:45.669 --> 00:07:48.003
I think it’s Spirit.

00:07:48.103 --> 00:07:52.069
If the Spirit is awakened within you, you develop the bhakti

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.103
and drop out all nonsensical ideas,

00:07:55.203 --> 00:07:59.270
all different things that have crawled into your head,

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.943
but you just develop the bhakti.

00:08:02.077 --> 00:08:06.443
Now Sahaja Yoga is a actualisation,

00:08:06.543 --> 00:08:10.944
Sahaja Yoga is a Sakshat, is actualisation,

00:08:11.044 --> 00:08:16.810
in which you know whom to worship and whom to surrender,

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.677
it’s not blind, in any way.

00:08:19.777 --> 00:08:24.010
Whatever is blind bhakti can take you to any kind of nonsense

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:28.376
and that’s how many cults have come
up, many [of] these things have come up,

00:08:28.476 --> 00:08:37.610
but that’s not a thing that sees, that knows, that understands.

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.944
It should be understood by your intelligence,

00:08:41.044 --> 00:08:47.410
by all your qualities – what is your bhakti is like.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:53.577
Now we have, through Kundalini awakening,
reached a very great height I must say

00:08:53.677 --> 00:08:59.844
of understanding of bhakti, the power of bhakti .

00:08:59.944 --> 00:09:08.144
The greatest power of bhakti is
that it protects you, it protects you.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:16.910
Those people who are suffering from
any kind of trouble, any kind of problems,

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:23.343
just get out of it because this bhakti of yours

00:09:23.443 --> 00:09:30.970
gives you the right type of understanding,
the understanding of your Self;

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:36.763
also the understanding of surroundings,
understanding of the whole Universe,

00:09:36.844 --> 00:09:38.777
I should say,

00:09:38.877 --> 00:09:41.977
why people behave like this, why they are like this,

00:09:42.077 --> 00:09:46.576
all this can be solved through your bhakti.

00:09:46.743 --> 00:09:51.949
It should not be blind, it should not
be blind, but it should be wise bhakti,

00:09:52.044 --> 00:09:53.877
wise with wisdom.

00:09:53.971 --> 00:10:00.504
First of all is, to test yourself you must see, “Am I wise?

00:10:00.604 --> 00:10:06.071
Am I wise? Do I do wise things or I’m not doing?”

00:10:06.337 --> 00:10:10.470
So many complaints come to me, about Sahaja Yogis also.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.971
I am surprised, why: why are they doing like that?

00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:18.704
I would say, still, they have not reached the state of bhakti.

00:10:18.804 --> 00:10:24.871
Bhakti and shraddha, these two things
are missing in the Western life, I must say.

00:10:24.971 --> 00:10:29.370
We should come back, we should develop, we should grow.

00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:34.104
So, I would say, the Goddess gives you bhakti and shraddha.

00:10:34.284 --> 00:10:36.284
By what?

00:10:36.384 --> 00:10:40.384
She gives you through your meditation;

00:10:40.484 --> 00:10:45.018
that you see so many miracles
happening in your life and you are amazed.

00:10:45.284 --> 00:10:49.684
“How this has happened? We never expected this to happen.

00:10:49.784 --> 00:10:51.429
How it has happened?”

00:10:51.562 --> 00:10:56.462
The devi’s powers first of all existed in Her body only

00:10:56.562 --> 00:11:04.729
and She killed so many rakshasas
and evil people – She did, kill it, actually.

00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:10.529
But now, there’s no need because you
all are there and you are the instruments.

00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:16.595
And it will all work out in such a way that
all those people who are trying to destroy

00:11:16.696 --> 00:11:22.263
the goodness, trying to destroy wise people,

00:11:22.529 --> 00:11:27.629
they will be killed, they’ll be finished, they’ll be destroyed.

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:32.662
This is not to be done through
any outside instrument or anything.

00:11:32.762 --> 00:11:36.822
It’s your wisdom, is the biggest
instrument that will work it out.

00:11:37.136 --> 00:11:42.578
So She is the giver of wisdom. This
is the biggest quality of the Goddess,

00:11:42.698 --> 00:11:45.098
that She is the giver of wisdom.

00:11:45.198 --> 00:11:49.465
And wisdom comes as a part of the evolutionary process.

00:11:49.565 --> 00:11:53.832
Now She has brought about all
the evolution so far, and to go further

00:11:54.017 --> 00:11:57.658
She is going to make you a very wise person.
