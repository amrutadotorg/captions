00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.738
It’s such a pleasure to be in the ashram in San Diego.

00:00:16.655 --> 00:00:19.822
And it’s such a beautiful place,

00:00:20.488 --> 00:00:24.321
so much expressing the love of God,

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:30.780
the Divine, the way it wants to help you at every step.

00:00:31.238 --> 00:00:33.238
If you want to have an ashram,

00:00:33.613 --> 00:00:35.697
if you want to have a proper place,

00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:38.822
you want to look after your children well,

00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:42.905
you want to do God’s work,

00:00:43.196 --> 00:00:45.029
everything is looked after,

00:00:45.405 --> 00:00:48.113
everything has to be worked out.

00:00:48.613 --> 00:00:50.987
If it is not worked out,

00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:53.780
then how will you do your work?

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:56.279
So, it all works out.

00:00:56.697 --> 00:01:01.363
And it’s so obvious, the way we have different ashrams,

00:01:01.822 --> 00:01:03.947
such comfortable places

00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:09.029
at a very reasonable amount that we can afford,

00:01:09.405 --> 00:01:12.279
that we can live happily together.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.113
This is the abode created by love for you.

00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:19.446
So, the first thing we have to remember,

00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:24.029
that among ourselves we should have complete love.

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:32.530
We should not trust people who try to

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.530
divide us,

00:01:35.822 --> 00:01:39.655
who try to give us wrong ideas.

00:01:40.196 --> 00:01:44.571
It’s very easy to make out a person who is a Sahaja yogi

00:01:45.987 --> 00:01:47.029
from the heart.

00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:48.613
It’s very easy to make out.

00:01:48.947 --> 00:01:50.697
You have to be a little more sensitive

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:53.488
and you’ll find out such a person very easily.

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:57.947
Whatever may be the cunning, it can be discovered.

00:01:58.363 --> 00:02:00.613
Nobody can act against God now,

00:02:00.947 --> 00:02:04.613
because everything will be discovered and will be found out.

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:10.113
But we have to have our attention fully

00:02:11.238 --> 00:02:14.363
on your Mother.

00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:18.321
But some people do get little more fanatic

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:20.571
because they are so attached, doesn’t matter,

00:02:20.987 --> 00:02:21.947
you’ll come round.

00:02:22.196 --> 00:02:25.405
But is better to be fanatic than to be doubting.

00:02:25.822 --> 00:02:31.113
So those people who do things little over,

00:02:31.655 --> 00:02:35.029
should commit to a life

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.321
that whatever they see,

00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:39.655
whatever they understand in Sahaja Yoga,

00:02:39.988 --> 00:02:42.780
whatever happens, they will accept it

00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:46.196
without any anxiety about it.

00:02:46.655 --> 00:02:49.987
This is the point, that we build up

00:02:50.238 --> 00:02:52.988
our images about Sahaja Yoga also.

00:02:53.363 --> 00:02:55.780
We cannot build up – it is what it is.

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:58.571
We cannot build up our image

00:02:58.987 --> 00:03:01.113
that we think Sahaja Yoga should be like this,

00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:03.029
Sahaja Yoga should be like that – it cannot be.

00:03:03.446 --> 00:03:06.321
You cannot compromise, you just cannot compromise.

00:03:06.655 --> 00:03:08.488
It has to be what it is.

00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:11.780
It cannot be anything that you want it to be.

00:03:12.154 --> 00:03:16.947
You cannot mould it, because it is fixed long time back.

00:03:17.446 --> 00:03:19.655
Now it is what it is,

00:03:19.988 --> 00:03:24.405
and that is why it is working out so well, so efficiently.

00:03:24.822 --> 00:03:26.697
But to make it more efficient

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:29.738
you have to accept its working.

00:03:30.113 --> 00:03:33.113
Like yesterday’s timings, you see:

00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:35.363
I knew there must be something,

00:03:35.738 --> 00:03:39.279
and the time was not yet ready.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.279
The time I spent here

00:03:41.613 --> 00:03:44.113
would have been spent raising their kundalini,

00:03:45.196 --> 00:03:46.530
unnecessarily wasted.

00:03:46.863 --> 00:03:48.947
Instead of that, five minutes I took,

00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:51.238
it took Me to give them realization.

00:03:51.571 --> 00:03:56.196
So, it’s, everything has to be understood in that light.

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:01.405
Gradually you will start seeing the divine play,

00:04:01.822 --> 00:04:03.488
how things work out,

00:04:03.947 --> 00:04:06.488
how it helps you.

00:04:06.905 --> 00:04:11.196
But supposing God has brought

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.113
something before you.

00:04:14.697 --> 00:04:19.113
Dr. Worlikar told Me a nice story about this

00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:20.530
which is very interesting,

00:04:20.905 --> 00:04:23.196
that between the Goddess of wealth

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.196
and the Goddess of education there was a little conflict.

00:04:28.613 --> 00:04:32.530
You can say education or the Saraswati,

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:36.071
which if neglected

00:04:36.488 --> 00:04:41.279
or if too much adored can make you egoistical,

00:04:41.697 --> 00:04:44.530
in the sense that if you become a person

00:04:44.905 --> 00:04:46.530
who is after learning, learning, learning,

00:04:46.863 --> 00:04:49.530
you can be thrown on the other side.

00:04:49.987 --> 00:04:55.780
So, this lady wanted to test the power of wealth.

00:04:56.154 --> 00:04:58.613
So, She said to the Laksmi that

00:04:58.987 --> 00:05:01.154
“All right, let’s see, on this person.”

00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:05.863
This person was a beggar, he needed money,

00:05:06.363 --> 00:05:07.905
and very much.

00:05:08.238 --> 00:05:13.655
So, Laksmi put lot of money in a big utensils,

00:05:13.905 --> 00:05:15.113
what we call handa,

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.863
and put it in his way.

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:23.446
This fellow was walking,

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:27.321
so Saraswati entered into his mind.

00:05:27.822 --> 00:05:29.988
As soon as Saraswati enters into the mind

00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:33.987
he became egoistical, and he didn’t even look at that,

00:05:34.321 --> 00:05:35.530
he just walked off.

00:05:35.947 --> 00:05:37.738
That was his need, but he walked off.

00:05:38.196 --> 00:05:43.405
So it suggests one thing, that when people become egoistical,

00:05:43.822 --> 00:05:46.405
start making their own plans,

00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:50.655
start making their own suggestions and images they form,

00:05:51.154 --> 00:05:55.863
then what happens that the Divine,

00:05:56.196 --> 00:05:59.279
which is trying to supply for your need,

00:05:59.697 --> 00:06:04.446
for your wants, for your solutions, disappears.

00:06:05.863 --> 00:06:07.071
This is what happens,

00:06:07.321 --> 00:06:11.613
that we do not allow the Divine to have its play.

00:06:11.947 --> 00:06:14.196
This is not only on material level;

00:06:14.613 --> 00:06:16.905
it is true also on emotional level,

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:23.738
it is true also on our physical level,

00:06:25.321 --> 00:06:27.530
but the best of all

00:06:27.822 --> 00:06:30.613
that it is true about spiritual level also.

00:06:30.987 --> 00:06:32.321
So we should not miss the point.

00:06:32.613 --> 00:06:36.905
Let the Divine play its role, and we should be able to see.

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:39.780
Like Krishna has said, “Karmanyevadikaraste”

00:06:40.154 --> 00:06:42.071
– “It is our job to do the job.”

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.822
Now we’ve done the puja, aarti’s done.

00:06:46.363 --> 00:06:49.780
I said, “All right, if we can do it, all right;

00:06:50.071 --> 00:06:51.987
if we cannot, I’ll go by the evening plane.”

00:06:52.405 --> 00:06:55.154
I am not bothered, whether I go by morning plane

00:06:55.446 --> 00:06:57.113
or evening plane doesn’t matter.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.987
I’m absolutely relaxed.

00:06:59.363 --> 00:07:01.780
We discussed certain important points had to be discussed,

00:07:02.154 --> 00:07:03.697
some time had to be spent;

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:06.697
that has to be done, that’s part of our life.

00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:09.947
So I’m not anxious that I should go by one o’clock plane.

00:07:10.238 --> 00:07:12.029
All right, I’ll go by the night plane,

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:13.238
makes no difference to Me.

00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:18.488
So just to have a very relaxed mind,

00:07:18.905 --> 00:07:21.822
to watch how things come forward.

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:23.613
People unnecessarily –

00:07:42.905 --> 00:07:44.987
Now when we understand

00:07:45.238 --> 00:07:49.613
that the Divine is having its complete play,

00:07:49.947 --> 00:07:54.279
its own working,

00:07:54.738 --> 00:07:56.238
the whole thing is working for us,

00:07:56.697 --> 00:07:59.238
for you, the Sahaja yogis.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.279
Once you realize that,

00:08:01.697 --> 00:08:05.780
then you feel absolutely relaxed and you are in joy.

00:08:06.238 --> 00:08:07.697
But when you start,

00:08:08.113 --> 00:08:10.029
“Oh, this should have been like this,

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.405
that should have been like this,”

00:08:12.863 --> 00:08:16.613
then everything is against joy.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.113
Whichever way it comes is all right.

00:08:20.488 --> 00:08:22.196
Once you develop that attitude,

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:25.530
then the joy will be complete.

00:08:26.279 --> 00:08:28.113
I have seen in emotional life also

00:08:28.571 --> 00:08:30.697
if you people suffer too much.

00:08:31.154 --> 00:08:35.238
The reason is, for everything you start thinking.

00:08:36.196 --> 00:08:39.947
Now in India, how we get married is very simple, you see.

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:44.488
From childhood we are taught that “You’ll be married,

00:08:44.947 --> 00:08:47.822
so you must learn how to live with your husband,”

00:08:48.238 --> 00:08:51.780
and a man is always told how to treat your wife.

00:08:52.154 --> 00:08:54.154
But they don’t know who is the wife and the husband.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.987
But the husband and wife is just a sort of a symbol.

00:08:59.446 --> 00:09:00.905
They don’t know which one it is;

00:09:01.238 --> 00:09:03.029
just could be anyone.

00:09:03.405 --> 00:09:06.321
So, once you accept her as a dharma,

00:09:06.697 --> 00:09:10.113
it comes as a surprise to you, and just enjoy.

00:09:10.571 --> 00:09:12.947
And the whole thing is built up to a point,

00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:15.988
to a moment which has to be auspicious also.

00:09:16.446 --> 00:09:19.113
Of course, they consult the horoscopes,

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.405
that’s an important part,

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.863
because horoscopes if you don’t consult,

00:09:23.196 --> 00:09:24.321
could be quite disastrous.

00:09:24.655 --> 00:09:26.196
So, they consult the horoscopes.

00:09:26.613 --> 00:09:28.697
And if there are so many points

00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:30.987
– they say twenty-six points is ideal

00:09:31.446 --> 00:09:34.405
– then they get married, otherwise they don’t.

00:09:34.905 --> 00:09:40.822
Now it’s not necessary that we do not meet or we meet.

00:09:41.196 --> 00:09:44.488
Sometimes the people meet, talk to each other for one year,

00:09:44.987 --> 00:09:47.113
may be that their marriages are postponed,

00:09:47.488 --> 00:09:48.488
there’s no auspicious time.

00:09:48.863 --> 00:09:51.029
They get some time to be together,

00:09:51.405 --> 00:09:52.988
but never in private;

00:09:53.446 --> 00:09:55.071
they never go into privacy.

00:09:55.488 --> 00:09:58.071
So that moment is kept as sacred moment,

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.947
when you are going to meet your husband or wife

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:02.863
– that’s a very sacred moment,

00:10:03.196 --> 00:10:06.363
so you are concentrated on that point.

00:10:09.196 --> 00:10:11.822
So suddenly it is decided.

00:10:12.238 --> 00:10:14.530
Now, you keep that moment as sacred moment.

00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:18.947
Even sometimes it happens that you get some time in between,

00:10:19.238 --> 00:10:20.987
quite a lot, after decision;

00:10:21.321 --> 00:10:24.405
could be that you have to continue

00:10:24.905 --> 00:10:27.071
as a feeling, seeing that person.

00:10:27.405 --> 00:10:29.655
But then you do not divert your attention,

00:10:29.988 --> 00:10:33.113
it’s completely concentrated effort.

00:10:33.613 --> 00:10:37.571
It clicks, because you just accept it.

00:10:38.279 --> 00:10:40.863
But here people live together for three years,

00:10:41.321 --> 00:10:42.697
then they marry and divorce.

00:10:43.071 --> 00:10:45.571
I mean I can’t understand, even if three years you live,

00:10:45.863 --> 00:10:47.321
seven years you live, ten years they live,

00:10:47.697 --> 00:10:48.613
still they do the same.

00:10:48.947 --> 00:10:51.613
So, what’s the use of knowing each other for so many years,

00:10:51.905 --> 00:10:52.780
still you divorce?

00:10:53.071 --> 00:10:55.363
But it just clicks if you understand that

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:57.071
it’s a concentrated movement

00:10:57.488 --> 00:11:00.279
where you have everything concentrated,

00:11:00.738 --> 00:11:04.279
and you just meet the person and accept that person

00:11:04.655 --> 00:11:06.279
as your companion.

00:11:06.738 --> 00:11:10.905
Maybe one or two fail, but if you don’t think about it,

00:11:11.196 --> 00:11:12.363
it won’t fail so much.

00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:14.154
Because after marriage you start thinking,

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.905
“Oh I expected this, I expected that.

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:21.154
I thought this would be so; that’s not so.”

00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:24.154
And always trying to find fault with another,

00:11:24.446 --> 00:11:27.530
not with yourself – that’s the best part of it;

00:11:27.988 --> 00:11:30.988
not seeing that how you are adjusting to that person.

00:11:31.571 --> 00:11:33.530
Once you start thinking about marriage,

00:11:33.863 --> 00:11:37.196
marriage is finished, already done with.

00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:42.530
As a child is born to you, without thinking

00:11:43.029 --> 00:11:45.279
what sort of a child is going to come, you love the child,

00:11:45.655 --> 00:11:47.279
in the same way in the marriage

00:11:47.697 --> 00:11:51.530
you’ll have to develop that kind of a concentrated feeling.

00:11:51.988 --> 00:11:53.697
Then only marriages will be successful.

00:11:54.029 --> 00:11:57.363
But here, you see, like when you purchase something,

00:11:57.738 --> 00:11:59.238
you buy something, all right,

00:11:59.613 --> 00:12:01.738
then you think, “Oh, it was not good,

00:12:02.029 --> 00:12:03.405
I should have bought something else,

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.905
would have been better,” this, that.

00:12:06.321 --> 00:12:08.154
So, you go to another thing.

00:12:08.571 --> 00:12:12.071
Things are different; things are things.

00:12:12.655 --> 00:12:14.488
Human beings are living things,

00:12:14.947 --> 00:12:16.446
they are not dead things

00:12:16.822 --> 00:12:18.738
that you can change one from another,

00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:22.071
“I could have got that one or that one.”

00:12:22.405 --> 00:12:24.321
You cannot go on like this with human beings

00:12:24.655 --> 00:12:27.613
– you’re playing with the Divine then.

00:12:28.363 --> 00:12:32.113
And this is the main point where we feel that

00:12:32.488 --> 00:12:36.697
Sahaja yogis have to learn to accept

00:12:37.029 --> 00:12:38.655
with joy, with happiness,

00:12:38.988 --> 00:12:42.613
and not to project nonsensical ideas.

00:12:44.071 --> 00:12:47.363
Then only you will find your joy will be complete.

00:12:47.738 --> 00:12:49.279
Otherwise it will not be.

00:12:49.697 --> 00:12:52.488
Then if you come, say, to the physical side:

00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:55.863
like here it is, if a woman is very thin,

00:12:56.196 --> 00:12:58.987
she wants to have legs like this, hands like this,

00:12:59.363 --> 00:13:02.196
body like this. Why?

00:13:02.655 --> 00:13:04.530
I mean, imagine everybody to be regimented

00:13:04.863 --> 00:13:07.363
into certain patterns, so much of the waist,

00:13:07.697 --> 00:13:09.738
so much of the thing – horrible it will be.

00:13:10.071 --> 00:13:12.321
I mean you’ll be tired and fed-up with that.

00:13:12.822 --> 00:13:14.196
So, you want to be like that.

00:13:14.613 --> 00:13:17.446
Now the fashion comes in that physically

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.530
we should be Mr. America or whatever you may call it.

00:13:21.905 --> 00:13:25.238
So everybody is doing jogging, everybody running like mad.

00:13:25.697 --> 00:13:29.363
But why? You have your own personality, keep it up.

00:13:29.738 --> 00:13:33.154
You need certain things for your body, the way you are.

00:13:33.571 --> 00:13:35.405
Of course, if your health is not all right

00:13:35.822 --> 00:13:38.071
then you try with your chakras, cure it.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.947
But to appearances, to think that

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:43.238
“I should look like this, I should be like that,”

00:13:43.571 --> 00:13:45.196
makes no difference at all.

00:13:45.697 --> 00:13:49.154
So again, another madness starts, so people are very unhappy.

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:53.238
You see, you go to these very so-called elite classes

00:13:53.655 --> 00:13:56.488
where most of the men are very highly paid,

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.363
educated, top class people,

00:13:59.697 --> 00:14:02.113
women are also educated, everything,

00:14:02.446 --> 00:14:03.987
and what they talk is this only:

00:14:04.321 --> 00:14:06.780
how much calories you eat, this is that.

00:14:07.071 --> 00:14:09.113
You don’t understand, what’s the matter with these people?

00:14:09.488 --> 00:14:13.154
Their level is so low.

00:14:13.947 --> 00:14:16.446
That’s a decent talk, and if they come to indecency,

00:14:16.738 --> 00:14:18.947
they can go to any level also there.

00:14:19.196 --> 00:14:21.947
So that shows that there has been no evolution

00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:23.446
in that person.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:25.905
They just think on those terms.

00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:27.905
And that’s how they become very serious,

00:14:28.196 --> 00:14:30.029
very seriously they discuss all this thing.

00:14:30.446 --> 00:14:33.905
You feel like laughing at them, the way they are stupid.

00:14:34.279 --> 00:14:35.987
So, all these things are regarded

00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:38.571
as so important in a country like America

00:14:38.905 --> 00:14:42.947
or any other country, shows the kind of people they have.

00:14:44.071 --> 00:14:46.655
I mean, in India nobody is so much bothered about the figure.

00:14:46.987 --> 00:14:50.196
At least in My age people never liked very thin girls,

00:14:50.613 --> 00:14:52.822
because they thought they must be very irritable,

00:14:53.154 --> 00:14:55.321
hot-tempered, all the time thinking.

00:14:55.738 --> 00:14:58.154
They never liked very thin girls I really tell you;

00:14:58.530 --> 00:14:59.780
even now My husband doesn’t like.

00:14:59.988 --> 00:15:01.947
He says, “You see, men have befooled women,

00:15:02.279 --> 00:15:04.987
and that’s why women are doing all these things.”

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:06.571
You see, he’s a simple man,

00:15:06.947 --> 00:15:08.613
so he thinks that the men have befooled them.

00:15:09.029 --> 00:15:11.988
So, it’s like that, and then they make legs like this

00:15:12.321 --> 00:15:14.613
or teeth like this or nose like this

00:15:14.947 --> 00:15:18.279
and you take a plastic nose, put on – why?

00:15:18.655 --> 00:15:22.987
So physical also imbalances come in when we start thinking.

00:15:23.321 --> 00:15:26.279
Because when we think, we collide with another thinking,

00:15:26.738 --> 00:15:28.822
then we form a general thinking,

00:15:29.238 --> 00:15:31.196
then a general pattern is accepted.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:35.113
When that is accepted people say, “All right, let’s have it.”

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:37.905
First, they used to have very tight clothes, you see,

00:15:38.113 --> 00:15:40.530
and one girl was boasting to Me that she wore

00:15:40.822 --> 00:15:42.571
it for eight days and she can’t take it out now.

00:15:42.905 --> 00:15:43.947
I said, “How, how did you manage?”

00:15:44.279 --> 00:15:46.363
She said, “This is something that you can wear

00:15:46.697 --> 00:15:49.113
and jump into the tub,

00:15:49.613 --> 00:15:52.196
and then it shrinks and you can’t take it out.

00:15:52.571 --> 00:15:53.613
You can have bath with this,

00:15:53.988 --> 00:15:55.613
you can do what you like with this.”

00:15:56.029 --> 00:15:57.071
I said, “It’s very filthy.”

00:15:57.488 --> 00:15:59.780
“No, no, you can wash it nicely and wipe it.”

00:16:00.154 --> 00:16:01.905
But I said, “Why, why do such a thing

00:16:02.238 --> 00:16:06.655
which will completely coagulate your blood inside?”

00:16:06.988 --> 00:16:08.321
Now they started suffering,

00:16:08.697 --> 00:16:11.029
so now they’re having absolutely loose clothes, you see,

00:16:11.321 --> 00:16:14.905
lanky-pankies, casual, this thing.

00:16:15.405 --> 00:16:17.071
So, they jump from one to another

00:16:17.405 --> 00:16:19.196
when you go on thinking about it,

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.613
trying to devise new methods.

00:16:22.988 --> 00:16:24.613
But tradition is different.

00:16:24.987 --> 00:16:28.780
Tradition is that when people are traditional,

00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:31.655
what happens actually, those people who are sensible

00:16:31.987 --> 00:16:33.238
can only become traditional,

00:16:33.697 --> 00:16:36.238
because they understand whatever is to be discarded,

00:16:36.613 --> 00:16:37.822
whatever is not to be discarded.

00:16:38.196 --> 00:16:40.738
And they try to understand how we are going to ascend.

00:16:41.154 --> 00:16:42.905
Not by taking one side,

00:16:43.321 --> 00:16:45.154
but on both the sides we must weigh

00:16:45.613 --> 00:16:47.988
and balance ourselves and then go ahead.

00:16:48.238 --> 00:16:50.363
And whatever is to be discarded to be discarded,

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.196
whatever is to be good is to be taken up.

00:16:54.655 --> 00:16:58.279
Like what you call the trial and error business.

00:16:58.655 --> 00:17:01.113
You see, you make the error – all right, give it up;

00:17:01.571 --> 00:17:03.530
then take another – all right, give it up.

00:17:03.947 --> 00:17:06.780
Whatever is good, you keep it and go on with it,

00:17:07.154 --> 00:17:09.154
and that’s how you build up a proper tradition

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:11.363
for other people to follow.

00:17:11.822 --> 00:17:14.697
But those who think of the new things all the time,

00:17:14.988 --> 00:17:17.196
they want to have something new all the time,

00:17:17.738 --> 00:17:19.446
then they are very much mistaken,

00:17:19.863 --> 00:17:22.987
that when they do like this what we call is a tomfoolery.

00:17:23.363 --> 00:17:25.655
With the new things they can land themselves

00:17:26.071 --> 00:17:28.822
into terrible messes, and that’s what exactly has happened

00:17:29.238 --> 00:17:31.822
to most of the Western countries,

00:17:32.154 --> 00:17:33.530
that everything new they try.

00:17:33.905 --> 00:17:37.279
Now the new craze is cocaine – all right, have cocaine.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:39.655
I mean, even I would not be surprised

00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:41.697
if Prince Philip takes to such a thing

00:17:42.071 --> 00:17:43.571
or somebody takes to thing like that.

00:17:43.987 --> 00:17:45.655
I mean, everybody wants to try new,

00:17:46.071 --> 00:17:50.571
and if you say you cannot try then they say, “Why, why not?”

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.363
This is a very big problem with the Western mind.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.613
So, you all people should also understand,

00:17:57.988 --> 00:18:01.405
don’t try new things in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:03.446 --> 00:18:06.822
Sahaja Yoga is a traditionally built thing.

00:18:07.238 --> 00:18:10.738
Don’t try anything new in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:11.196 --> 00:18:13.780
Whatever we have is more than sufficient,

00:18:14.196 --> 00:18:15.279
you don’t try anything new.

00:18:15.655 --> 00:18:18.405
People who tried new things have jumped into problems,

00:18:18.863 --> 00:18:22.154
so do not try something new.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:26.279
Like somebody said that nowadays, you see,

00:18:26.822 --> 00:18:29.196
I heard in London we had some people

00:18:29.571 --> 00:18:31.405
who started giving lectures

00:18:31.947 --> 00:18:35.947
and giving new methods of Sahaja Yoga, suddenly.

00:18:36.363 --> 00:18:37.405
And they all went mad.

00:18:37.863 --> 00:18:39.987
I mean, their vibrations were crazy,

00:18:40.321 --> 00:18:41.863
I didn’t know what to do with them.

00:18:42.238 --> 00:18:43.238
I was quite surprised.

00:18:43.571 --> 00:18:45.863
I said, “Why did you try a new method like that?

00:18:46.154 --> 00:18:48.446
What was the need to try a new method?”

00:18:48.863 --> 00:18:52.029
“Oh,” they said, “Well we thought, better try this one.”

00:18:52.446 --> 00:18:54.238
But I said, “I have already told you all the methods.

00:18:54.571 --> 00:18:56.113
Have you tried, have you perfected yourself?

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:58.571
Better try those which I’ve told you,

00:18:59.029 --> 00:19:02.697
and then you can ask Me and then start something new.

00:19:03.071 --> 00:19:05.071
But you must understand what you are doing.”

00:19:05.488 --> 00:19:08.446
And also, I’ve seen mediocre Sahaja yogis always do like that,

00:19:08.863 --> 00:19:12.405
try some new method. And they’ll come out with this thing,

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.613
“Now I’ll tell you how to circulate your breath.”

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:18.530
Why to circulate your breath?

00:19:18.905 --> 00:19:20.321
Suddenly they find out a new method.

00:19:20.655 --> 00:19:23.571
Is a common thing, but these are sometimes could be

00:19:23.905 --> 00:19:26.405
very sinister people also, so be careful.

00:19:26.863 --> 00:19:28.988
There is no need to try new methods.

00:19:29.279 --> 00:19:31.822
Now you have jumped on to that awareness

00:19:32.154 --> 00:19:33.947
where you have to just be steady.

00:19:34.321 --> 00:19:36.697
So, don’t try at this point something new.

00:19:37.154 --> 00:19:40.738
Just steady yourself, steady yourself in balance

00:19:41.154 --> 00:19:43.780
– that’s very important.

00:19:44.238 --> 00:19:46.822
Second point is that everyone

00:19:47.113 --> 00:19:49.655
should be knowledgeable in Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:50.071 --> 00:19:52.697
But some people are so funnily knowledgeable

00:19:53.071 --> 00:19:55.279
that I’m sometimes surprised.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.905
Like there was a fellow who was homosexual

00:19:59.196 --> 00:20:00.571
or nonsensical thing,

00:20:00.988 --> 00:20:02.697
and then he told some people that

00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:05.988
“Yes, you see, Mother says it’s all right once in a while.”

00:20:06.446 --> 00:20:09.613
I never said so. I can never say such a thing.

00:20:10.113 --> 00:20:12.738
Then somebody said, “Drinking – all right, Mother said.”

00:20:13.113 --> 00:20:15.780
How could I say? There’s no compromise.

00:20:16.154 --> 00:20:19.988
Somebody says, “It’s all right, you can do some business.”

00:20:20.488 --> 00:20:21.738
I never said so.

00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:24.154
No, you cannot do, these things are not,

00:20:24.571 --> 00:20:25.613
they are not meant for you.

00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:28.446
You don’t have to do it at all. Right?

00:20:28.988 --> 00:20:31.321
So, anybody who comes out with such ideas,

00:20:31.697 --> 00:20:33.154
you tell them “nothing of the kind.”

00:20:33.655 --> 00:20:34.697
There’s nothing like that,

00:20:35.071 --> 00:20:37.780
there’s no compromise in Sahaja Yoga, no compromise.

00:20:38.196 --> 00:20:39.780
Whatever methods we have learned,

00:20:40.196 --> 00:20:42.613
let us practice them to establish ourselves

00:20:42.987 --> 00:20:43.822
and establish others.

00:20:44.154 --> 00:20:46.947
You must keep to your maryadas, to your limits.

00:20:47.405 --> 00:20:49.530
Do not try to fly.

00:20:49.988 --> 00:20:52.488
Some people think that they are greater Sahaja yogis

00:20:52.905 --> 00:20:54.780
and they will do this and they will do that.

00:20:55.113 --> 00:20:56.863
Then remember, that is wrong.

00:20:57.279 --> 00:20:59.154
You have to humble down yourself,

00:20:59.613 --> 00:21:02.113
and remember that when you humble down

00:21:02.571 --> 00:21:05.196
you will realize that only the humble people

00:21:05.571 --> 00:21:07.530
are steady people.

00:21:10.279 --> 00:21:12.530
So, there should be complete humility.

00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:16.196
Try to acquire more knowledge about Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:16.697 --> 00:21:17.988
There are so many ways.

00:21:18.488 --> 00:21:20.655
I have got all My tapes done already,

00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:24.780
we have got all these Sahaja Yoga books out now

00:21:25.154 --> 00:21:27.238
and also your “Nirmala Yoga” is there

00:21:27.655 --> 00:21:30.780
– so many ways by which you can understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:31.071 --> 00:21:33.405
If you don’t understand, you can ask each other,

00:21:33.822 --> 00:21:37.029
try to analyse it the way you want to understand,

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:40.488
that what Mother is saying, is this is what She’s saying.

00:21:40.905 --> 00:21:43.863
Because My lectures are in very, very simple language.

00:21:44.238 --> 00:21:46.738
I use extremely simple language,

00:21:47.154 --> 00:21:51.029
avoiding all literary language as far as possible of course;

00:21:51.405 --> 00:21:54.530
sometimes I do have to use difficult words, but normally.

00:21:54.987 --> 00:21:59.196
So, but beyond that is a very subtle knowledge flowing.

00:21:59.697 --> 00:22:02.363
So, to understand that sometimes may be difficult,

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.405
you may try to sort of construct something else out of it,

00:22:06.863 --> 00:22:08.987
may try to sort of interpret something.

00:22:09.363 --> 00:22:10.613
If there’s any such problem,

00:22:10.987 --> 00:22:13.154
better consult somebody whom you think

00:22:13.613 --> 00:22:15.446
is capable of advising you.

00:22:15.863 --> 00:22:17.697
But you must accept that.

00:22:18.071 --> 00:22:20.238
You should not put forward your viewpoint,

00:22:20.655 --> 00:22:22.238
and it would be very wrong.

00:22:22.655 --> 00:22:26.363
Then you will be sort of like a derailed train

00:22:26.863 --> 00:22:28.738
which goes out of track.

00:22:29.196 --> 00:22:30.947
We have a track in Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:31.279 --> 00:22:33.029
you must know that, whether you like it or not.

00:22:33.488 --> 00:22:36.863
It’s no question of freedom, but the track to ascend.

00:22:37.279 --> 00:22:38.905
You cannot get out of that track.

00:22:39.321 --> 00:22:42.113
If you think you can just move about a little bit,

00:22:42.655 --> 00:22:45.613
have a nice time with all filth

00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:48.863
and then come back to Sahaja Yoga, you won’t be acceptable.

00:22:49.321 --> 00:22:51.863
If you do that then I’ll have to work hard

00:22:52.279 --> 00:22:54.446
to cleanse you out, do this, do that.

00:22:54.947 --> 00:22:57.822
But to keep yourself clean you’d better keep to your tracks

00:22:58.279 --> 00:22:59.488
and don’t get out of it.

00:22:59.947 --> 00:23:05.113
Don’t try to find out new things of doing something

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.571
which is not necessary; why do it?

00:23:07.988 --> 00:23:13.530
I mean, simple thing is to understand it’s a waste of energy.

00:23:14.113 --> 00:23:15.571
I’ve already found it for you,

00:23:15.863 --> 00:23:16.697
why do you want to do it again?

00:23:17.071 --> 00:23:18.488
Like this kind of a blouse

00:23:18.863 --> 00:23:21.697
I’ve been wearing now for the last, I think,

00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:25.363
fifty years or maybe more, this type of a blouse.

00:23:25.822 --> 00:23:28.863
Now My tailor knows that I wear this blouse, this is this,

00:23:29.154 --> 00:23:31.113
this is this. He has got My measurements.

00:23:31.488 --> 00:23:33.238
So, I have to just tell him that

00:23:33.613 --> 00:23:36.029
“You get Me a cloth of this kind,

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:38.488
and just make a blouse for Me.” He makes it.

00:23:38.987 --> 00:23:40.488
For the last so many years I have had,

00:23:40.905 --> 00:23:43.905
about twenty-five years, I had one tailor who does My job.

00:23:44.321 --> 00:23:46.238
He has no headache, I have no headache, no problem.

00:23:46.655 --> 00:23:49.154
Every day if I have to change this pattern,

00:23:49.697 --> 00:23:52.071
make a new sleeve and a new type of a blouse,

00:23:52.446 --> 00:23:55.238
I’ll have a headache, I mean, I tell you.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.655
So why, why do that? What’s the use?

00:23:58.029 --> 00:24:01.154
Who sees, who is affected by that?

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:06.488
So unnecessarily we are wasting our energy on these things.

00:24:06.987 --> 00:24:09.071
But I don’t say that you should be regimented,

00:24:09.446 --> 00:24:13.071
by any means, but what I mean that wherever

00:24:13.405 --> 00:24:15.571
you can save your energy of thinking, you should do it.

00:24:15.905 --> 00:24:18.655
For small, small things there’s no need to have varieties,

00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:21.488
and this country as I’ve told you before

00:24:21.947 --> 00:24:23.571
hat every tap has to be different,

00:24:23.988 --> 00:24:25.405
every handle is to be different,

00:24:25.863 --> 00:24:29.071
every tile has to be different – what is the need?

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.154
What has to be different is artistic things.

00:24:32.697 --> 00:24:35.613
Sari has to be different because it is artistic.

00:24:36.029 --> 00:24:37.780
But what is in a stitching of a blouse,

00:24:38.154 --> 00:24:39.238
there’s no art in it involved.

00:24:39.655 --> 00:24:42.113
So, whatever is artistic can be different,

00:24:42.571 --> 00:24:44.405
but whatever is mundane need not be.

00:24:44.863 --> 00:24:46.863
In the machinery why should you have

00:24:47.238 --> 00:24:48.446
different types of things, you’ll go mad.

00:24:48.905 --> 00:24:51.154
You go to a shop, there’s twenty types of things,

00:24:51.571 --> 00:24:54.321
you don’t which one to buy, all made by machine only.

00:24:54.738 --> 00:24:56.029
This is good, that is good.

00:24:56.446 --> 00:24:58.613
Then another fellow he comes, he says, “Not good.”

00:24:58.988 --> 00:25:00.488
Then you feel hurt.

00:25:00.863 --> 00:25:04.530
But if you have for mundane things, few things is better,

00:25:04.947 --> 00:25:08.613
that you do not take too many headaches upon yourself.

00:25:08.988 --> 00:25:11.530
So best thing to avoid all these problems

00:25:11.905 --> 00:25:14.238
is to use your new awareness of vibrations.

00:25:14.613 --> 00:25:16.196
So, you save your energies.

00:25:16.613 --> 00:25:18.363
Your energies must be saved,

00:25:18.905 --> 00:25:22.279
and they can be saved if you do not pay attention to things

00:25:22.697 --> 00:25:26.571
which are not your style, where you don’t have to go.

00:25:26.947 --> 00:25:29.530
Just see vibrations. If I go for shopping

00:25:29.987 --> 00:25:32.196
– now I go shopping for various reasons, as you know.

00:25:32.655 --> 00:25:34.947
One is to put My vibrations there;

00:25:35.321 --> 00:25:39.113
another is to put also vibrations on the people

00:25:39.488 --> 00:25:40.738
who are in the market.

00:25:41.071 --> 00:25:42.905
Thirdly is to look at all the things,

00:25:43.238 --> 00:25:44.987
so My vibrations go onto them.

00:25:45.405 --> 00:25:48.196
Fourthly, to buy something to be given to others.

00:25:48.697 --> 00:25:52.029
But if I like something it is only through vibrations

00:25:52.405 --> 00:25:55.321
and I buy it somehow,

00:25:56.822 --> 00:25:58.697
because it is to be given to someone

00:25:59.154 --> 00:26:01.071
or something has to be done later.

00:26:01.488 --> 00:26:05.113
I just buy it, keep it, it comes very handy.

00:26:06.697 --> 00:26:08.987
That is how your attitude should be.

00:26:09.405 --> 00:26:11.655
But on the contrary if you just go on,

00:26:12.071 --> 00:26:14.655
“I like this, I don’t like it,” about your wife,

00:26:15.071 --> 00:26:18.613
about your jobs, your everything, you’ll be uncertain.

00:26:18.987 --> 00:26:19.988
These days in America

00:26:20.363 --> 00:26:22.905
people are very funny about their jobs also.

00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:24.488
I have to touch these points,

00:26:24.863 --> 00:26:25.987
because you’ll face this problem.

00:26:26.363 --> 00:26:28.196
Today they’re doing some job, “I don’t like it,

00:26:28.613 --> 00:26:30.238
I don’t like my boss” – another job.

00:26:30.738 --> 00:26:32.446
Then they’ll go to another job, they change it.

00:26:32.863 --> 00:26:34.238
Then third job, change it.

00:26:34.571 --> 00:26:36.613
They like to change, you know, all the time

00:26:36.988 --> 00:26:38.822
– it’s maddening, I tell you.

00:26:39.196 --> 00:26:40.988
Change their wives, change their house,

00:26:41.363 --> 00:26:43.947
change everything. Why?

00:26:44.363 --> 00:26:48.238
Have only one wife, is better.

00:26:48.697 --> 00:26:51.822
At the most have two jobs in life, is better.

00:26:52.321 --> 00:26:56.613
And at the most change three residences, is better.

00:26:56.988 --> 00:26:58.822
But more than that is a headache.

00:26:59.154 --> 00:27:01.113
I mean, to Me, I have changed forty houses

00:27:01.446 --> 00:27:04.905
because of My husband’s temperament.

00:27:06.947 --> 00:27:11.279
But I’m different, because I’m absolutely a person

00:27:11.655 --> 00:27:14.238
who is not bothered whatever change comes.

00:27:14.697 --> 00:27:16.988
But you are not the same, so don’t waste your energy.

00:27:17.446 --> 00:27:19.405
So, this is very important to understand,

00:27:19.905 --> 00:27:23.655
not to go on changing jobs, is very important.

00:27:24.363 --> 00:27:26.446
Because that is also a craze, I tell you.

00:27:26.987 --> 00:27:28.947
I’ll tell you about Douglas. He used to do that.

00:27:29.363 --> 00:27:30.988
Every time he had financial problem

00:27:31.405 --> 00:27:35.405
because he was changing jobs. So, one day I told him off.

00:27:35.822 --> 00:27:38.071
I said, “Douglas, if you change this job”

00:27:38.405 --> 00:27:39.947
– because I saw the vibrations are all right

00:27:40.446 --> 00:27:41.571
– “if you change this job,

00:27:41.987 --> 00:27:43.530
that you are not going to see Me again.”

00:27:43.988 --> 00:27:47.488
And now today he has got a house, he’s got a car,

00:27:47.905 --> 00:27:51.697
he’s got money in the bank, he’s doing well.

00:27:54.987 --> 00:27:57.613
So that also is a headache for Me,

00:27:57.988 --> 00:28:02.196
“Mother, I have no job, I have no money. What am I to do?”

00:28:02.738 --> 00:28:06.363
Every time there are people who come to India, they say,

00:28:06.822 --> 00:28:09.071
“Mother, I have no money, I’m sorry I couldn’t pay You.”

00:28:09.488 --> 00:28:11.196
All right, doesn’t matter.

00:28:11.613 --> 00:28:14.571
There are at least, this last time also there were five people.

00:28:14.988 --> 00:28:17.363
But before that I think there were about twenty people.

00:28:17.863 --> 00:28:19.697
So, every time it happens like this.

00:28:20.154 --> 00:28:23.071
So now we must understand, we must have proper jobs.

00:28:23.446 --> 00:28:25.029
We have to be respectable people.

00:28:25.571 --> 00:28:27.196
We must have proper qualifications,

00:28:27.655 --> 00:28:29.863
if possible, better to get some qualifications.

00:28:30.279 --> 00:28:32.113
You are all very intelligent people

00:28:32.613 --> 00:28:34.613
and you can get your qualifications.

00:28:35.071 --> 00:28:37.655
You should have a respectability in the society.

00:28:38.071 --> 00:28:40.029
Otherwise they’ll think that this Mother

00:28:40.446 --> 00:28:43.530
is the Mother of all the beggars.

00:28:45.446 --> 00:28:49.113
So steady yourself in your jobs, in your houses.

00:28:49.613 --> 00:28:53.988
To steady yourself you must learn not to change.

00:28:59.029 --> 00:29:03.738
The change makes you unsteady – do you see the point?

00:29:04.196 --> 00:29:05.613
So, there is no question of changing.

00:29:05.987 --> 00:29:08.071
“I’m going to go through it.”

00:29:08.613 --> 00:29:12.488
Then if it is necessary, if it is not workable,

00:29:12.947 --> 00:29:14.905
then one can change.

00:29:15.321 --> 00:29:17.488
It applies to everything.

00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:22.196
Now, guru-shopping is nothing but change.

00:29:22.697 --> 00:29:26.071
The more gurus you have, the greater headache I have.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.905
If you have only one guru, say horrible one,

00:29:29.321 --> 00:29:30.863
it’s all right, easy to clear you out.

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:33.822
But if you have been to twenty, whatever am I to do?

00:29:34.279 --> 00:29:36.655
One fellow who has been to gurus so much

00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:38.822
that I couldn’t understand his personality.

00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:40.822
I said, “What’s the matter with this?”

00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:43.822
Every problem, you name it and it’s there.

00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:45.697
I said, “What sort of a fellow is this?”

00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:47.113
So, I said, “All right, write it down

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:48.780
all the names of all the gurus you have been to.”

00:29:49.154 --> 00:29:53.321
He wrote three foolscap papers on both the sides.

00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:56.113
I said, “I’m sorry, sir, I can’t help you.”

00:29:56.571 --> 00:29:57.863
He said, “Mother, You have to,

00:29:58.196 --> 00:29:59.947
because there’s a very immediate problem.”

00:30:00.321 --> 00:30:02.113
I said, “What is the immediate problem?”

00:30:02.571 --> 00:30:04.738
“That now I am becoming a woman.”

00:30:05.196 --> 00:30:07.988
I said, “Hah?”

00:30:08.446 --> 00:30:11.905
“The doctors have said that now I’m becoming a woman.”

00:30:12.613 --> 00:30:14.947
I said, “That’s really an immediate problem.”

00:30:15.363 --> 00:30:19.071
I said, “That much I can stop, but you need lot of cleansing.”

00:30:19.655 --> 00:30:21.697
And he used to sometimes look like Hanumana,

00:30:22.071 --> 00:30:23.571
sometimes he looks like a madman,

00:30:23.987 --> 00:30:25.113
he used to look like anything,

00:30:25.488 --> 00:30:27.905
because so many gurus in him were working it out.

00:30:28.321 --> 00:30:31.988
Ultimately that he got himself cleansed out

00:30:32.363 --> 00:30:34.238
and his problem was solved,

00:30:34.697 --> 00:30:36.780
but even now I would not say that he is a Sahaja yogi;

00:30:37.113 --> 00:30:39.697
though he’s very learned, knows all about Sanskrit

00:30:39.987 --> 00:30:41.071
because he has been to so many gurus,

00:30:41.405 --> 00:30:44.655
every type of guru he has been.

00:30:45.238 --> 00:30:48.988
This has come by change – “what’s wrong?”

00:30:49.863 --> 00:30:53.863
So, once you come to Sahaja Yoga, then stop.

00:30:54.571 --> 00:30:57.405
Stop everything else.

00:30:57.947 --> 00:31:00.988
Second point that I stressed was this,

00:31:01.530 --> 00:31:04.029
that in Sahaja Yoga once you come,

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.363
focus yourself to Me and Sahaja Yoga first,

00:31:07.863 --> 00:31:08.780
and then other things.

00:31:09.154 --> 00:31:10.655
Like Christians when they come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:11.071 --> 00:31:13.113
they can’t accept Ganesh.

00:31:13.655 --> 00:31:17.571
Indians who come to Sahaja Yoga cannot accept Christ.

00:31:17.988 --> 00:31:21.822
Muslims who come to Sahaja Yoga cannot take to puja.

00:31:22.363 --> 00:31:24.863
Everybody is coming with a load behind them.

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:28.405
So better come and put them at My feet, finished.

00:31:28.863 --> 00:31:31.613
Now you see them through My prism,

00:31:32.113 --> 00:31:36.154
through Me – is better to understand that way.

00:31:36.613 --> 00:31:38.988
And those who have understood Me that way,

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:42.405
just understand Sahaja Yoga in a perfect manner.

00:31:42.863 --> 00:31:45.446
There’s no fanaticism of the past,

00:31:45.905 --> 00:31:47.613
neither of Sahaja Yoga either.

00:31:47.987 --> 00:31:51.279
So, they understand that this is all the same as Mother is,

00:31:51.697 --> 00:31:54.154
and there’s nothing to be sticking

00:31:54.571 --> 00:31:56.196
onto one thing or to another.

00:31:56.697 --> 00:31:59.697
But it doesn’t mean that if you call Me

00:32:00.071 --> 00:32:02.655
the Goddess Kali you are insulting Me,

00:32:03.071 --> 00:32:06.363
or if you call Me Mataji Nirmala Devi you’re elevating Me

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.863
– it’s all there.

00:32:09.363 --> 00:32:12.363
So one has to understand that all this

00:32:13.113 --> 00:32:16.154
is related to our own compartments.

00:32:16.613 --> 00:32:19.780
God has no compartments like that.

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.196
It is not that America exists in His mind,

00:32:23.697 --> 00:32:25.987
or it is not that anything exists in mind.

00:32:26.446 --> 00:32:29.738
Do we exist like “now I am only my Vishuddhi”

00:32:30.196 --> 00:32:31.321
– do we exist like that?

00:32:31.738 --> 00:32:33.863
Or “I’m only my nose” – do we?

00:32:34.321 --> 00:32:35.905
We exist as the whole body.

00:32:36.405 --> 00:32:40.530
So, God exists – though He has a nose, He has His ears, say,

00:32:40.988 --> 00:32:43.363
everything is there; but He exists as God.

00:32:43.822 --> 00:32:46.029
He doesn’t exist like a nose, separate,

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:48.405
doesn’t exist like only America separate,

00:32:48.822 --> 00:32:51.363
but He’s existing as the whole,

00:32:51.863 --> 00:32:57.071
everything related to the whole.

00:32:57.905 --> 00:33:00.405
And when such a thing happens to us

00:33:00.863 --> 00:33:04.029
that now we are related to the whole, the Primordial Being,

00:33:04.571 --> 00:33:06.279
we should not relate ourselves

00:33:06.697 --> 00:33:07.905
to something that will localize us

00:33:08.363 --> 00:33:10.697
because of our conditionings.

00:33:11.238 --> 00:33:12.780
No localization should be there,

00:33:13.029 --> 00:33:14.905
we should be in circulation.

00:33:15.405 --> 00:33:18.530
I find it difficult for people who have been Catholics

00:33:18.987 --> 00:33:22.988
to worship Shri Ganesh with the same respect,

00:33:23.488 --> 00:33:24.571
because they are conditioned.

00:33:24.988 --> 00:33:26.738
So, try to leave it for a while, Christ,

00:33:27.113 --> 00:33:28.405
completely leave Him alone.

00:33:28.947 --> 00:33:32.321
Come to Sahaja Yoga, then you’ll see Him in proper light.

00:33:32.863 --> 00:33:34.613
Because this is the problem is,

00:33:35.071 --> 00:33:40.363
that unless and until you come inside and see for yourself

00:33:40.738 --> 00:33:43.029
that all roads have come to this one thing,

00:33:43.571 --> 00:33:45.863
so they are just the same, there’s no difference at all.

00:33:46.279 --> 00:33:47.697
First come inside.

00:33:47.988 --> 00:33:49.780
Give up everything, come inside.

00:33:50.154 --> 00:33:52.446
Then you will know that it’s all the same.

00:33:52.947 --> 00:33:54.655
And this is very important,

00:33:55.113 --> 00:33:57.321
and once you see that,

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:01.029
it’s such a beautiful thing that you have no complications

00:34:01.530 --> 00:34:05.238
of any kind, belonging to any particular cult

00:34:05.738 --> 00:34:08.113
or particular guru or a particular thing.

00:34:08.571 --> 00:34:12.405
Even so-called religions are like cults if you see to it,

00:34:12.738 --> 00:34:14.613
they are like cults, they have conditionings.

00:34:15.029 --> 00:34:17.071
They have not given you anything but conditioning

00:34:17.405 --> 00:34:18.571
and illusions.

00:34:18.947 --> 00:34:20.154
So, we are not to live with illusions,

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:21.613
we have to live with reality.

00:34:21.987 --> 00:34:25.780
And the reality is that, that all these essences are one,

00:34:26.238 --> 00:34:28.321
and we have to be inside them

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:32.488
so that we can see them, all of them as one.

00:34:32.988 --> 00:34:36.822
This is also very important thing in country like America,

00:34:37.154 --> 00:34:40.279
I feel, because there are such diverse ideas,

00:34:40.697 --> 00:34:44.071
such diverse ideas that I, I’m surprised at them.

00:34:44.488 --> 00:34:46.530
Everything you name it is in America.

00:34:46.947 --> 00:34:49.613
The other day I developed one thing called Mormon,

00:34:50.154 --> 00:34:53.238
Mormon or something. Mormon.

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:55.488
Name it and it’s in America.

00:34:55.863 --> 00:34:59.738
I don’t know how all the varieties have gathered here.

00:35:00.154 --> 00:35:03.196
Every sort of a guru, I mean, you discover them here.

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.822
I had never heard of so many names.

00:35:05.196 --> 00:35:07.697
Whenever I come, I’d find a new guru coming up.

00:35:08.113 --> 00:35:11.571
Why America is the place where all these prosper like this,

00:35:11.905 --> 00:35:13.113
like mushrooms, you see?

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:16.321
A mushroom is growing, that is – is it a rottening thing?

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.655
Only mushroom grows as fungus.

00:35:20.279 --> 00:35:24.780
Is it rottening, this country? What’s happening? Why?

00:35:25.321 --> 00:35:27.613
It is the mind of human beings.

00:35:28.113 --> 00:35:31.780
The mind of human beings here always wants a new thing,

00:35:32.154 --> 00:35:34.571
and that’s why a supply comes.

00:35:35.029 --> 00:35:37.113
As a result of that they become unsteady.

00:35:37.613 --> 00:35:40.905
So, the main problem of American character

00:35:41.363 --> 00:35:43.822
is that they are very unsteady people.

00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.238
You ask them, “How are you?” They also say ….

00:35:49.071 --> 00:35:50.071
Understand whatever you like.

00:35:50.488 --> 00:35:53.530
They’ll never say “How are you?” ….

00:35:54.571 --> 00:35:55.947
What do you understand with that?

00:35:56.279 --> 00:35:58.405
I mean, an Indian person can’t understand.

00:35:58.905 --> 00:36:00.905
If somebody says like that, an Indian, you see,

00:36:01.238 --> 00:36:02.071
if you ask him, “How are you?”

00:36:02.488 --> 00:36:05.780
and he says like this, they’ll say, “Are you mad?”

00:36:09.154 --> 00:36:11.905
Then if you ask them, “Do you understand this?”

00:36:12.279 --> 00:36:14.488
“I’m confused.”

00:36:14.988 --> 00:36:16.446
An Indian will never say such a thing,

00:36:16.822 --> 00:36:18.780
“I’m confused.” He’s cocksure.

00:36:19.238 --> 00:36:21.363
“I’m confused” means, are you a lunatic or what?

00:36:21.863 --> 00:36:25.822
Why are you confused? Something wrong with your brain?

00:36:27.446 --> 00:36:29.446
So, all these ideas, you see,

00:36:29.987 --> 00:36:32.571
are tending towards our unsteadiness,

00:36:33.029 --> 00:36:35.279
frivolousness, superficiality.

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.655
You are really bombarded by superficiality,

00:36:39.154 --> 00:36:40.780
bombarded, I can see that.

00:36:41.238 --> 00:36:44.154
Absolutely from everywhere, you see, the media, this, that:

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:46.154
it’s nothing but superficial.

00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:50.196
It really kills the inner germ in the human being.

00:36:50.697 --> 00:36:51.822
And you want to live with it,

00:36:52.238 --> 00:36:54.530
then you want to think on those lines,

00:36:55.405 --> 00:36:58.822
and really you lose yourself, all contact with yourself is lost.

00:36:59.113 --> 00:37:01.571
Under all these circumstances one has to know

00:37:01.905 --> 00:37:03.530
one beautiful fact,

00:37:03.947 --> 00:37:07.405
that so many seekers are born in this country.

00:37:07.822 --> 00:37:11.822
It’s America which I visited the first.

00:37:13.071 --> 00:37:16.113
And I’m sure San Diego is the place where it will start,

00:37:16.446 --> 00:37:19.071
I have a feeling.

00:37:19.738 --> 00:37:22.279
[Marathi]

00:37:25.363 --> 00:37:27.780
So this is a place very important, and I’m nice,

00:37:28.113 --> 00:37:31.071
I’m happy that you have arranged this wonderful puja,

00:37:31.488 --> 00:37:32.987
and we should do this puja.

00:37:33.405 --> 00:37:38.446
And I am sure by this we will have a time,

00:37:39.029 --> 00:37:42.613
especially good time coming

00:37:43.154 --> 00:37:48.738
where we’ll have on one side American evolution,

00:37:49.154 --> 00:37:51.571
on the other side, Mexican.

00:37:52.029 --> 00:37:54.947
This we can work out from San Diego.

00:37:55.363 --> 00:37:58.863
It’s a beautiful day that you have asked for this puja.

00:37:59.321 --> 00:38:00.822
I’m very happy about it.

00:38:01.238 --> 00:38:03.071
Today is the day of the Goddess,

00:38:03.488 --> 00:38:08.196
[Marathi] – Thrayodashi.

00:38:12.154 --> 00:38:15.113
Thrayodashi is the best, thirteenth day.

00:38:15.613 --> 00:38:20.530
[Marathi]

00:38:32.655 --> 00:38:36.488
See the vibrations, you don’t need any puja!

00:38:43.071 --> 00:38:45.738
There’s no need to have a puja, really, it is so much today.

00:38:46.113 --> 00:38:47.363
So today is a great day,

00:38:47.697 --> 00:38:49.947
and I’m happy he’s asked for this puja here.

00:38:50.488 --> 00:38:55.071
So, now to begin with ….

00:38:55.613 --> 00:38:58.738
Now if you have any problems, any questions,

00:38:59.154 --> 00:39:01.279
you must let Me know.

00:39:01.822 --> 00:39:03.738
One thing, a Sahaja yogi should not be

00:39:04.071 --> 00:39:07.279
a serious person, that’s one thing.

00:39:08.905 --> 00:39:11.571
That doesn’t behove a Sahaja yogi to be serious.

00:39:12.071 --> 00:39:14.488
You should be smiling, laughing, enjoying.

00:39:14.947 --> 00:39:17.446
If he’s a serious person then he’s not a Sahaja yogi.

00:39:17.863 --> 00:39:20.113
I can’t keep serious for more than five minutes,

00:39:20.446 --> 00:39:21.780
at the most five minutes.

00:39:22.154 --> 00:39:24.988
Even if I have to scold somebody, I prepare Myself,

00:39:25.446 --> 00:39:27.822
then I come down and I shout,

00:39:28.196 --> 00:39:30.863
and then after five minutes if I don’t run away

00:39:31.363 --> 00:39:33.154
then you’ll find Me again laughing.

00:39:33.655 --> 00:39:35.947
Can’t – it’s all a joke!

00:39:41.279 --> 00:39:44.405
So, nobody should be serious, that’s one thing.

00:39:44.863 --> 00:39:45.987
Nobody should be serious.

00:39:46.321 --> 00:39:48.279
You should be always smiling and happy people,

00:39:48.738 --> 00:39:51.196
because there is joy within you. What is there?

00:39:51.655 --> 00:39:56.446
Only by thinking “I’m miserable, I’m miserable,” you see

00:39:58.113 --> 00:39:59.947
– that’s French style!

00:40:00.405 --> 00:40:02.697
French, you know, when I went there first time, they told Me,

00:40:03.071 --> 00:40:08.780
“Mother, You look too happy” – for French.

00:40:09.363 --> 00:40:10.405
So, I said, “What should I do?”

00:40:10.822 --> 00:40:12.405
Said, “Do You see, they are all very,

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.071
they think they are very Misérables people, this, that.”

00:40:15.613 --> 00:40:17.321
So, I said, “All right.” So I went and said,

00:40:17.655 --> 00:40:19.488
“Now see, you are all les Misérables”

00:40:19.947 --> 00:40:22.738
– you know Victor Hugo has written this “Les Misérables”

00:40:23.154 --> 00:40:25.113
– so I said, “All right, you les miserables.

00:40:25.488 --> 00:40:27.822
Now I am a person who is not miserable at all.

00:40:28.279 --> 00:40:30.987
And you will be miserable in any case if you have,

00:40:31.405 --> 00:40:35.822
every third house you have a pub,

00:40:36.238 --> 00:40:38.530
every tenth house you have a prostitute,

00:40:39.071 --> 00:40:42.405
so what will happen? I mean, you are in for it.”

00:40:43.113 --> 00:40:44.113
That’s what it is.

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:47.071
And even Yogi Mahajan told Me that

00:40:47.613 --> 00:40:50.571
“Mother, we want Your photograph which is very serious,

00:40:50.905 --> 00:40:52.238
it is hard to get one,

00:40:52.697 --> 00:40:55.988
and we must put a face which is very serious.”

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:58.988
And ultimately, he ended up with a photograph

00:40:59.488 --> 00:41:00.905
which was horrid.

00:41:01.405 --> 00:41:04.029
When he told Me, “It’s a very nice photograph,

00:41:04.446 --> 00:41:07.697
You look so serene,” this, that and all the descriptions.

00:41:08.029 --> 00:41:10.863
When I saw the photograph I said, “It’s horrid!”

00:41:11.405 --> 00:41:13.029
He said, “Really?”

00:41:13.405 --> 00:41:15.988
I said, “All right, let Me tell you who has done this.”

00:41:16.405 --> 00:41:19.738
He said, “Who?” I told him the name and he was shocked.

00:41:20.196 --> 00:41:22.613
I said, “That’s the lady who has given you,

00:41:22.988 --> 00:41:24.780
and you know where she is today.”

00:41:25.279 --> 00:41:29.154
Was shocked how I told the name “Jane.”

00:41:32.405 --> 00:41:35.405
I said, “This is the photograph you are sending to Americans.”

00:41:35.822 --> 00:41:38.655
But I know Americans will be attracted by that photograph,

00:41:38.947 --> 00:41:41.947
because they are miserable themselves, you see.

00:41:42.405 --> 00:41:44.697
But such people who are attracted

00:41:45.029 --> 00:41:47.780
to that kind of a photograph will drop out in no time,

00:41:48.238 --> 00:41:51.697
they will not stick on – you don’t understand that point.

00:41:52.196 --> 00:41:53.738
They are not the type who’ll stick on.

00:41:54.029 --> 00:41:55.530
Like in Scotland, I went there

00:41:55.947 --> 00:41:58.988
and there was a photograph I saw, and I got a shock.

00:41:59.446 --> 00:42:02.196
We had gone to a restaurant where we were to have our food,

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:04.905
and I saw My photograph and I said, “Who has done this one?”

00:42:05.279 --> 00:42:07.655
They said, “This is the copy of one of the Australian ones.”

00:42:08.071 --> 00:42:10.655
I said, “But who has done it?

00:42:11.154 --> 00:42:13.947
Because this is not good – very bad.”

00:42:14.488 --> 00:42:19.780
So, they said, “This is done by someone, suddenly.”

00:42:20.154 --> 00:42:21.321
I said, “I’ll name the person,”

00:42:21.738 --> 00:42:24.988
and I told them who has done it: Hilary.

00:42:25.822 --> 00:42:28.029
They were all amazed at it.

00:42:28.571 --> 00:42:30.863
I said, “This photograph is no good.”

00:42:31.238 --> 00:42:33.530
But now they had put it everywhere. I said, “Let it be.”

00:42:33.988 --> 00:42:37.738
So many people came to My program, all funny types, you know.

00:42:38.154 --> 00:42:40.279
Some had one eye, some had one nose,

00:42:40.613 --> 00:42:44.655
some had something else wrong, everything missing.

00:42:45.029 --> 00:42:48.405
“Oh God,” I said, “this is the thing of the photograph.”

00:42:48.987 --> 00:42:52.196
And not one person came back.

00:42:52.822 --> 00:42:54.321
We had at least about five,

00:42:54.697 --> 00:42:57.530
six hundred people for the program, all like this, you see.

00:42:57.947 --> 00:43:00.738
[Marathi]

00:43:01.488 --> 00:43:05.697
And none of them came back, not one person.

00:43:06.279 --> 00:43:10.446
All bhoots, attracted by the bhoot; and I could see

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:14.363
on My photograph that it was just repelling it.

00:43:16.238 --> 00:43:20.321
So those who take My photograph also

00:43:20.905 --> 00:43:25.488
reflect in the photograph.

00:43:26.279 --> 00:43:29.655
You must have seen Ray’s photograph come out very well.

00:43:30.113 --> 00:43:31.655
I don’t which one is Ray’s here,

00:43:32.029 --> 00:43:34.238
but Ray’s photographs used to be very good.

00:43:34.697 --> 00:43:37.321
And this time Ray, he has a funny wife, I think.

00:43:37.822 --> 00:43:39.738
He went to India, and Indians told Me,

00:43:40.196 --> 00:43:42.363
“Mother, I don’t know how this Ray is so ruined.”

00:43:42.697 --> 00:43:43.530
In India it doesn’t happen.

00:43:43.905 --> 00:43:45.987
Once a Sahaja yogi, then they improve.

00:43:46.405 --> 00:43:49.738
But this fellow was just the opposite – now what to do?

00:43:50.238 --> 00:43:52.196
They said, “Mother, he’s all gone down, what to do?”

00:43:52.613 --> 00:43:55.780
I said, “Must have been something wrong. What to do?”

00:43:56.279 --> 00:43:57.988
When I came back, you see,

00:43:58.363 --> 00:44:00.071
Ray brought three or four photographs of Mine.

00:44:00.405 --> 00:44:02.154
When he showed, everybody was shocked.

00:44:02.571 --> 00:44:05.488
“These are not Mother’s photographs.”

00:44:06.071 --> 00:44:10.029
And he had to withdraw them. This is what it is.

00:44:10.405 --> 00:44:12.947
Same Ray who made such beautiful photographs

00:44:13.363 --> 00:44:16.029
was having horrible photographs nowadays.

00:44:16.488 --> 00:44:20.571
So, in everything what you do, everything that you achieve,

00:44:21.029 --> 00:44:22.488
you can make it out.

00:44:22.987 --> 00:44:28.154
You suddenly become an extremely posh person, you can say,

00:44:28.613 --> 00:44:31.196
with a finesse, once you are a good Sahaja yogi.

00:44:31.571 --> 00:44:34.697
Everything comes in proper stream.

00:44:35.113 --> 00:44:37.947
You can make it out, very simple ways

00:44:38.405 --> 00:44:43.987
of such a person are so pleasing and so soothing.

00:44:45.987 --> 00:44:49.947
So, on these points I have covered lots of things

00:44:50.279 --> 00:44:54.363
which I wanted to say, and that end with it

00:44:54.738 --> 00:44:58.905
I would say that as Vishuddhis you have to become the sakshi,

00:44:59.279 --> 00:45:01.571
the witness. You have to become the witness.

00:45:02.071 --> 00:45:04.947
And to become the witness there has to be a detachment.

00:45:05.363 --> 00:45:08.279
That doesn’t mean you live on a shoestring by any chance,

00:45:08.738 --> 00:45:11.738
but try to have a detachment.

00:45:12.154 --> 00:45:15.988
Thank God this time the experience of the Sahaja yogis

00:45:16.488 --> 00:45:18.029
from America was not so bad.

00:45:18.446 --> 00:45:19.697
They were very good people,

00:45:20.071 --> 00:45:22.987
they adjusted themselves well and they enjoyed themselves.

00:45:23.363 --> 00:45:24.655
It was fine.

00:45:24.988 --> 00:45:30.655
And I hope more and more will come and will enjoy themselves.

00:45:31.071 --> 00:45:33.863
And as you know the new programming has taken place.

00:45:34.238 --> 00:45:37.363
Is better you people tell us if you are coming or not.

00:45:37.822 --> 00:45:39.780
But also, don’t change last minute,

00:45:40.238 --> 00:45:44.863
it creates problems for us, for everyone.

00:45:45.363 --> 00:45:48.530
So please don’t change; if you’re not coming, it’s all right.

00:45:48.987 --> 00:45:51.613
You will have a certain date, by that time you decide,

00:45:51.987 --> 00:45:54.613
don’t change. You see it’s only Americans who did this,

00:45:55.029 --> 00:45:57.488
nobody else.

00:45:57.905 --> 00:45:58.988
And we told people,

00:45:59.363 --> 00:46:01.822
“Now no more, let’s give more chance to Americans are coming,

00:46:02.154 --> 00:46:04.571
we should give them more chance; so no, you are not coming.”

00:46:04.987 --> 00:46:07.987
So poor things, they came for ten days, five days,

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:11.987
because we could not arrange for them.

00:46:12.947 --> 00:46:14.780
So, you should not change your ideas.

00:46:15.321 --> 00:46:18.697
If you are coming you can decide up to a point,

00:46:19.154 --> 00:46:20.988
if you are coming or not coming.

00:46:21.446 --> 00:46:25.071
If you are not coming you just say, “Yes, we are not coming,”

00:46:25.446 --> 00:46:28.363
or if you are coming you just say,

00:46:28.738 --> 00:46:30.905
“Yes we are coming,” and you do it.

00:46:31.363 --> 00:46:34.822
At least that much you should not change.

00:46:36.029 --> 00:46:39.822
So again, I request you to keep to your schedules and things,

00:46:40.238 --> 00:46:43.530
because it really upsets the whole thing.

00:46:43.988 --> 00:46:47.279
Because now we are working on the rhythm of the Divine,

00:46:47.822 --> 00:46:50.321
and we have no business to upset the rhythm.

00:46:52.363 --> 00:46:55.029
You may be Americans, but as you know in Sahaja Yoga

00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:57.987
Americans are not placed very high up.

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.029
You know that very well.

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:03.446
And we think Italians are much better off;

00:47:03.987 --> 00:47:08.947
they take to Sahaja Yoga just like a fish takes to water.

00:47:10.196 --> 00:47:13.530
So, Americans have to work a little harder,

00:47:13.988 --> 00:47:19.071
they have to do a little more to get to that adjustments.

00:47:21.113 --> 00:47:25.238
What to do? Such a great a country, so many seekers,

00:47:25.738 --> 00:47:28.238
but they are already ruined – what am I to do?

00:47:28.738 --> 00:47:29.780
Trying My level best.

00:47:30.154 --> 00:47:32.530
You all should help and understand the difficulties,

00:47:32.987 --> 00:47:35.196
and you have to be kind to the newcomers and see

00:47:35.697 --> 00:47:38.697
that you put them right.

00:47:39.738 --> 00:47:45.780
So, we have to think of our ascent from San Diego,

00:47:46.238 --> 00:47:49.613
and from this corner we are going to enlighten

00:47:50.029 --> 00:47:53.196
the whole of America.

00:47:53.613 --> 00:47:56.697
For practical purposes I’ve decided

00:47:57.113 --> 00:48:00.446
that Dr. Worlikar should be in charge

00:48:00.905 --> 00:48:06.613
in the eastern side

00:48:07.154 --> 00:48:09.863
[Marathi]

00:48:10.488 --> 00:48:13.363
– western side.

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:16.446
For us, New York is already western, all right;

00:48:16.947 --> 00:48:20.363
and the eastern side is, the New York side

00:48:20.822 --> 00:48:23.863
can be managed by him.

00:48:24.279 --> 00:48:27.029
Because there’s a, like a two countries it is, two countries,

00:48:27.446 --> 00:48:28.738
two different types of thing.

00:48:29.238 --> 00:48:30.987
So that is how it is to be managed.

00:48:31.571 --> 00:48:35.947
Money matters: you should do deal with money matters

00:48:36.279 --> 00:48:37.405
with his consent.

00:48:37.863 --> 00:48:41.405
So, I told him how I do it is that the money

00:48:41.822 --> 00:48:45.113
is kept in the bank under the name of the

00:48:45.571 --> 00:48:47.780
registered name or whichever way it is,

00:48:48.238 --> 00:48:53.987
and they have the check book, but I have to sign.

00:48:54.905 --> 00:48:57.029
So, you keep the check book but he has to sign,

00:48:57.405 --> 00:48:59.655
so he sees what you are spending.

00:49:00.113 --> 00:49:01.405
So, check is there.

00:49:01.863 --> 00:49:03.738
Or you do the same there, see,

00:49:04.071 --> 00:49:06.571
so that she keeps the check book but you sign,

00:49:06.947 --> 00:49:09.113
so you know how much is being spent.

00:49:09.571 --> 00:49:10.613
So, there’s a check.

00:49:11.029 --> 00:49:13.405
Of course, as far as you people are concerned,

00:49:13.738 --> 00:49:15.863
I know it’s all right, but still ….

00:49:16.279 --> 00:49:20.488
Why I do so many things, just to make you understand.

00:49:21.071 --> 00:49:25.613
Like if you give Me puja money, I keep a packet of that.

00:49:26.113 --> 00:49:27.446
I keep an account of that.

00:49:27.905 --> 00:49:29.488
There’s no need: who’s going to ask Me

00:49:29.863 --> 00:49:31.321
what did I do with the puja money?

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.738
But I do, I do keep it.

00:49:35.196 --> 00:49:38.488
And then what do I do with the puja money is that

00:49:38.987 --> 00:49:42.113
I want to use it for your puja materials, puja things,

00:49:42.488 --> 00:49:43.446
for presents and things.

00:49:43.738 --> 00:49:45.863
So, I keep. I need not do it, that’s My money,

00:49:46.196 --> 00:49:49.154
at least that much is Mine,

00:49:49.988 --> 00:49:51.987
but My pleasure is such.

00:49:52.363 --> 00:49:54.780
So that is how one must know that

00:49:55.071 --> 00:50:00.488
if Mother is so strict with it, why not we?

00:50:01.363 --> 00:50:04.071
You have to give money in puja, no doubt,

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:05.697
because that has to be.

00:50:06.029 --> 00:50:07.613
First, we used to take one “p”.

00:50:08.071 --> 00:50:12.113
Then I went to two “p”, then to five “p’s”, ten “p’s”

00:50:12.613 --> 00:50:15.154
– it has increased like that.

00:50:15.655 --> 00:50:16.947
And for these pujas then,

00:50:17.279 --> 00:50:19.071
for the main pujas that we are going to have,

00:50:19.488 --> 00:50:21.863
one on New York, they have decided certain amount.

00:50:22.238 --> 00:50:24.029
That is your decision, I never said anything,

00:50:24.488 --> 00:50:27.029
because I was only up to one pound, I was there.

00:50:27.488 --> 00:50:29.947
Then I don’t know, I got lost with these people.

00:50:30.613 --> 00:50:33.988
So whatever they decide, that is there,

00:50:34.488 --> 00:50:37.947
is the money that is collected under the name of puja,

00:50:38.405 --> 00:50:42.363
which I have to take for the Nabhi Chakra.

00:50:42.863 --> 00:50:46.988
You have to do it with heart, just like the Shabari style,

00:50:47.488 --> 00:50:52.279
and everything will fall in proper places.

00:50:53.446 --> 00:50:58.154
So one can say that

00:50:58.697 --> 00:51:01.780
Sahaja Yoga is not an extreme thing.

00:51:02.238 --> 00:51:03.988
We do give money;

00:51:04.405 --> 00:51:06.988
only the Sahaja yogis can donate money.

00:51:07.571 --> 00:51:10.071
Say, for food here you have to pay,

00:51:10.571 --> 00:51:11.905
for the house you have to pay.

00:51:12.279 --> 00:51:15.238
You do pay, you don’t live here like parasites.

00:51:15.738 --> 00:51:17.822
We don’t want parasites around us.

00:51:18.279 --> 00:51:20.363
But it doesn’t also mean that you rob

00:51:20.738 --> 00:51:23.863
a Sahaja yogi completely and make him a pauper,

00:51:24.279 --> 00:51:28.238
and build your own Rolls Royces!

00:51:30.697 --> 00:51:36.405
So it is not also the other way, that you people rob Me.

00:51:40.363 --> 00:51:44.655
So one has to understand that Sahaja Yoga is give and take,

00:51:45.071 --> 00:51:47.405
in a proper certain manners,

00:51:47.905 --> 00:51:52.071
and that has to be properly done with grace,

00:51:52.571 --> 00:51:56.863
with understanding, with a beautiful feeling

00:51:57.321 --> 00:52:00.987
that we are all part and parcel of the whole.

00:52:03.947 --> 00:52:07.905
And for which America is responsible,

00:52:08.363 --> 00:52:12.154
because America has to become the Virat.

00:52:15.446 --> 00:52:19.405
The Vishuddhi has to become the Virat.

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:23.905
What a responsibility!

00:52:24.446 --> 00:52:26.446
So don’t quarrel among yourselves,

00:52:26.947 --> 00:52:30.154
don’t quarrel among husband and wife.

00:52:30.738 --> 00:52:37.613
Try to be one in complete unison, enjoy each other.

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:41.154
That’s very important. All right.

00:52:41.488 --> 00:52:42.571
So may God bless you.

00:52:42.905 --> 00:52:45.780
[Marathi: This is Virata’s place]

00:52:46.238 --> 00:52:52.863
Even now the Right Vishuddhi is catching. All right.

[Marathi – directions for puja]

00:55:10.029 --> 00:55:14.738
Now, I want those people who have not washed My feet so far,

00:55:15.196 --> 00:55:17.905
should come forward.

00:55:21.196 --> 00:55:23.405
One by one.

00:55:29.571 --> 00:55:31.780
Let them handle the situation.

00:55:32.071 --> 00:55:33.530
… can do it.

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:35.613
Danny, you also come here.

00:55:35.947 --> 00:55:40.405
Now, two persons at a time will do it.

00:55:53.988 --> 00:55:56.738
It’s very cold water.

00:56:08.613 --> 00:56:11.446
Very good, very good. Very, very good.

00:56:16.113 --> 00:56:19.488
Rub it. Rub My feet.

00:57:28.613 --> 00:57:31.697
Now just see your vibrations.

00:57:35.405 --> 00:57:37.446
All right?

00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:39.279
Good?

00:57:39.613 --> 00:57:41.655
May God bless you. Now come along.

00:57:42.113 --> 00:57:43.988
Should be warm.

00:57:57.988 --> 00:58:02.363
Come along, both of you.

00:58:07.071 --> 00:58:09.822
May God bless you.

00:58:13.738 --> 00:58:15.738
Rub it.

00:58:16.154 --> 00:58:18.655
Put it on this one.

00:58:19.822 --> 00:58:22.405
Rub it.

00:59:35.113 --> 00:59:39.071
Done! Now, come along – see your vibrations.

00:59:47.863 --> 00:59:49.822
Now, keep smiling like that, it’s all right,

00:59:50.113 --> 00:59:53.613
it’s all right – the sari can be dried.

00:59:55.738 --> 00:59:58.113
May God bless you.

00:59:58.822 --> 01:00:01.113
On the eyes and the head, wipe it.

01:00:01.530 --> 01:00:04.154
Come along.

01:00:07.029 --> 01:00:09.863
Very good.

01:00:22.738 --> 01:00:25.071
May God bless you.

01:00:31.238 --> 01:00:37.405
Hold it with one hand, tight, and another hand, rub it hard.

01:01:01.738 --> 01:01:07.321
Ah, good. You can feel the vibrations well.

01:01:08.279 --> 01:01:13.363
Your right, left hand, rub it – the last finger, pull it out.

01:01:14.154 --> 01:01:17.405
Last finger, pull it out.

01:02:19.321 --> 01:02:21.863
It’s got it.

01:02:22.571 --> 01:02:25.405
Now, see your vibrations.

01:02:32.405 --> 01:02:34.446
May God bless you.

01:02:35.697 --> 01:02:37.738
On the eyes and the head.

01:02:38.029 --> 01:02:41.238
Come along. Your face has changed with this!

01:02:43.154 --> 01:02:45.822
All right? Good. May God bless.

01:02:51.321 --> 01:02:54.363
Perfect.

01:03:21.238 --> 01:03:25.154
That’s all. Come along. That’s better.

01:03:25.822 --> 01:03:29.196
Right, now hold it tight.

01:03:31.446 --> 01:03:33.196
Rub your full hand.

01:03:33.571 --> 01:03:37.780
You see, the hand, your hand is to be rubbed, not My feet.

01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:43.196
Pull that out. Pull it tight.

01:03:56.988 --> 01:03:59.613
Ah!

01:05:18.738 --> 01:05:21.530
Mm, good.

01:05:22.321 --> 01:05:24.238
I think we are all right.

01:05:25.113 --> 01:05:27.655
Now just sit, this side.

01:05:34.905 --> 01:05:36.905
All right?

01:05:40.488 --> 01:05:42.613
You can’t keep it.

01:05:42.987 --> 01:05:44.780
Put it on your head.

01:05:45.113 --> 01:05:48.613
On your head, and then wipe your eyes also.

01:05:55.029 --> 01:05:57.405
May God bless you.

01:06:07.613 --> 01:06:10.196
I think you come with him, that’s all right.

01:06:11.947 --> 01:06:14.697
It’s all right. A little water.

01:06:14.988 --> 01:06:19.029
Now, they can use the same water to do My feet. Come along.

01:06:26.238 --> 01:06:29.613
May God bless you.

01:06:30.446 --> 01:06:32.321
Now...

01:06:38.071 --> 01:06:43.154
Hold it. Rub it hard.

01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:52.613
Rub it hard.

01:07:37.863 --> 01:07:40.571
Now see.

01:07:52.488 --> 01:07:54.987
Now.

01:07:56.988 --> 01:07:59.113
All right?

01:07:59.822 --> 01:08:03.738
See the left is – a little bit.

01:08:40.530 --> 01:08:41.697
All right.

01:08:41.905 --> 01:08:43.613
While sitting, just put the left hand towards Me,

01:08:43.947 --> 01:08:46.154
right hand on the Mother Earth.

01:08:46.697 --> 01:08:51.738
Good? May God bless.

01:10:02.238 --> 01:10:05.738
Good. Now, just see yourselves.

01:10:16.113 --> 01:10:18.363
How are you? All right?

01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:21.863
Not yet, feeling?

01:10:26.488 --> 01:10:28.697
Good. Very good.

01:10:35.530 --> 01:10:38.321
May God bless you.

01:11:06.405 --> 01:11:10.613
Put your left hand here. Rub it.

01:11:48.655 --> 01:11:51.697
All right. Now see for yourself.

01:11:59.697 --> 01:12:00.988
All right?

01:12:08.947 --> 01:12:11.530
May God bless you.

01:12:15.279 --> 01:12:20.947
Just put it on your head first, and then on your eyes.

01:12:22.029 --> 01:12:23.947
Good, nice.

01:12:24.321 --> 01:12:27.863
Feeling fine? Shiny, eh?

01:12:41.697 --> 01:12:44.446
Little bit you can lift from this side, this one;

01:12:44.863 --> 01:12:48.071
this side, yes.

01:12:50.738 --> 01:12:53.113
That’s all right.

01:13:40.446 --> 01:13:42.988
Done!

01:13:43.571 --> 01:13:46.363
See yourself now.

01:13:52.530 --> 01:13:55.530
May God bless.

01:14:01.488 --> 01:14:04.071
Has he washed?

01:14:05.863 --> 01:14:07.988
Her husband?

01:14:08.363 --> 01:14:11.113
He’s washed My feet?

01:14:11.905 --> 01:14:15.987
You both? Both are washed?

01:14:17.113 --> 01:14:19.571
All right.

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:22.655
So, do you want to wash it again?

01:14:23.029 --> 01:14:26.488
All right. Now come.

01:14:29.238 --> 01:14:32.488
Are you all right, Jeshua?

01:14:34.738 --> 01:14:37.530
Better.

01:14:38.987 --> 01:14:40.988
All right.

01:14:41.488 --> 01:14:43.530
Let him play with the water.

01:14:55.697 --> 01:14:57.571
Close his hands.

01:14:57.905 --> 01:15:00.363
Ask him to play with the water, would be better.

01:15:00.822 --> 01:15:03.738
In the water. Ask him to immerse his feet in the water.

01:15:09.154 --> 01:15:13.321
Put it on Mine. Wash My feet.

01:15:13.863 --> 01:15:15.947
Good, good, good.

01:15:16.196 --> 01:15:18.113
Then touch My feet.

01:15:18.446 --> 01:15:21.238
Now put his hands on Mine.

01:15:40.988 --> 01:15:43.947
Good. Hallo! All right.

01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:52.029
So may God bless you all.

01:15:52.446 --> 01:15:54.905
He’s all right now.

01:15:55.697 --> 01:15:58.738
You have washed, both of you have washed.

01:17:40.987 --> 01:17:43.655
Just put more water.

01:17:46.405 --> 01:17:49.321
Pour all that, I think.

01:17:52.405 --> 01:17:54.988
And more is needed.

01:17:59.488 --> 01:18:01.613
That is better.

01:20:02.613 --> 01:20:05.780
Hundred-and-eight names.

01:20:12.196 --> 01:20:15.571
You said hundred-and-eight names you have got.

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:28.988
Hundred-and-eight names.

01:20:53.113 --> 01:20:55.530
You showed Me thousand names you had.

01:20:56.113 --> 01:20:58.738
These are …

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:02.279
hundred-and-eight.

01:21:40.613 --> 01:21:43.822
These are the hundred-and-eight names?

01:21:46.446 --> 01:21:49.655
Of Mahakali.

01:21:53.947 --> 01:21:56.571
Oh, take a hundred names.

01:22:00.863 --> 01:22:02.029
It starts with Shri Mata?

01:22:02.363 --> 01:22:05.029
Take out that one, all right?

01:22:13.113 --> 01:22:14.321
Sahasranama.

01:22:14.697 --> 01:22:17.363
Yes, we have Shri Lalita.

01:22:27.488 --> 01:22:28.905
This is the praise,

01:22:29.196 --> 01:22:31.363
after the Goddess killed the two rakshasas

01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:33.321
called Shumba, Nishumba.

01:22:33.738 --> 01:22:36.071
They’re all again back on the seat.

01:22:36.446 --> 01:22:40.113
So now the praise of the gods,

01:22:40.571 --> 01:22:42.405
you have to do the same praise.

01:22:42.905 --> 01:22:44.697
Now, we’ll start – you know that

01:22:45.113 --> 01:22:47.446
up to a point he will read it,

01:22:47.905 --> 01:22:50.738
and then he will tell you that

01:22:51.196 --> 01:22:53.530
you have to put it “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu”

01:22:53.987 --> 01:22:56.363
– he’ll tell you “Buddhi” so you should put it,

01:22:56.738 --> 01:22:59.154
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Buddhi rupena samsthita.”

01:22:59.530 --> 01:23:01.363
You know that – “Namas Tasyai namas Tasyai

01:23:01.738 --> 01:23:02.780
namas Tasyai namoh namah.”

01:25:03.655 --> 01:25:06.071
First he will say the beginning of it.

01:25:06.446 --> 01:25:09.279
This is how the gods, you see, praised the Goddess,

01:25:09.697 --> 01:25:12.863
when She killed Shumba, Nishumba. So ….

01:25:17.113 --> 01:25:20.321
The first of all you have to give the – what you call

01:25:20.613 --> 01:25:22.363
– the ghee.

01:25:22.905 --> 01:25:24.987
But there is no spoon.

01:25:25.405 --> 01:25:28.863
For ghee at least you have some spoons.

01:26:32.530 --> 01:26:35.279
Also the moon.

01:26:35.655 --> 01:26:37.321
She’s like moon.

01:26:37.697 --> 01:26:39.947
Face is like moon ….

01:26:44.530 --> 01:26:46.905
Just water.

01:27:01.947 --> 01:27:04.738
“Sarva” is the essence.

01:27:05.238 --> 01:27:07.988
She’s the one who’s the ruler of everything.

01:27:20.571 --> 01:27:27.238
Extremely gentle, and extremely harsh.

01:27:34.279 --> 01:27:37.154
We are the intelligence.

01:27:39.613 --> 01:27:41.987
She’s the intelligence in every human being.

01:27:42.363 --> 01:27:43.697
She’s expressed as intelligence,

01:27:43.988 --> 01:27:45.988
pure intelligence in every human being.

01:27:57.363 --> 01:27:58.987
So you just say “Shraddha.”

01:27:59.321 --> 01:28:00.947
And now you repeat together.

01:28:01.279 --> 01:28:03.905
You say “Shraddha” – now say.

01:30:22.488 --> 01:30:25.655
Should be sugar and then water.

01:33:05.905 --> 01:33:08.113
Unmarried girls now.

01:33:12.655 --> 01:33:15.196
Unmarried.

01:34:06.196 --> 01:34:08.987
She used to do it always in Bombay.

01:34:19.988 --> 01:34:21.988
You also do it the same way.

01:34:33.196 --> 01:34:35.488
Now.

01:34:58.822 --> 01:34:59.947
You should say,

01:35:03.613 --> 01:35:06.530
“Sakshat Shri Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namah.

01:35:06.822 --> 01:35:08.863
Shri Mata Sakshat Shri …”

01:35:09.196 --> 01:35:11.947
– what do you say?

01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:17.488
Just say, “Om twamewa sakshat Shri Mata,”

01:35:17.822 --> 01:35:19.238
that’s all – “namoh namah.”

01:35:19.530 --> 01:35:21.987
Yes, that’s all. That’s all.

01:35:27.029 --> 01:35:29.321
[Yogi: These are hundred and eight out of the thousand names

01:35:29.697 --> 01:35:33.405
of Mahadevi given in the “Shri Lalita Sahasranama.”]

01:36:11.446 --> 01:36:14.905
First is “Shri Mata.” So now say

01:39:12.488 --> 01:39:14.822
“Pataka nashini”

01:39:16.113 --> 01:39:18.154
– killer of all the sins.

01:39:18.530 --> 01:39:20.196
So that’s why I said, don’t feel guilty.

01:39:20.655 --> 01:39:23.363
She’s the killer of all the sins.

01:39:24.738 --> 01:39:27.613
Maha-pat: the greatest of –

01:39:28.697 --> 01:39:31.405
Maha-pataka nashini.

01:42:55.530 --> 01:42:59.279
“Nistula” – means “uncomparable.”

01:44:45.446 --> 01:44:47.655
You should first of all touch here.

01:44:55.822 --> 01:44:58.530
First.

01:45:19.863 --> 01:45:22.405
Go and wash your hands.

01:45:28.905 --> 01:45:32.863
Unmarried women. Unmarried.

01:48:15.405 --> 01:48:16.405
With the Para-shakti,

01:48:16.738 --> 01:48:20.571
all the work which it looks at all happens.

01:48:24.488 --> 01:48:27.446
“Yogada.”

01:48:28.154 --> 01:48:31.697
I have given you the yoga, you see, the union.

01:49:05.822 --> 01:49:08.822
“Labdhaa. Punya-labhya” – by the punyas.

01:49:09.113 --> 01:49:12.822
You see, if you have no punyas, you cannot find any.

01:49:13.905 --> 01:49:16.113
So if many people are lost, you shouldn’t worry;

01:49:16.405 --> 01:49:18.363
they have no punyas. What can you do?

01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:21.071
“Punya-labdhaa.”

01:50:34.613 --> 01:50:37.987
“Shobhana-sulabha-gati” – “Shobhana” means “gracious”,

01:50:38.363 --> 01:50:41.071
“sulabha” means “easy” and by that,

01:50:41.488 --> 01:50:44.071
“gati” … “movement.”

01:50:44.738 --> 01:50:48.405
You get to the, your realization through

01:50:48.738 --> 01:50:49.987
“Shobhana-sulabha-gati.”

01:50:50.363 --> 01:50:53.113
There is no disgraceful behavior,

01:50:53.613 --> 01:50:56.029
or it is very beautifully done,

01:50:56.571 --> 01:50:59.530
and also “sulabha” is “easy.”

01:52:04.029 --> 01:52:07.571
“Shubha-kari” – Giver of auspiciousness.

01:53:42.488 --> 01:53:47.655
Not the red. No, not the red. Now, two.

01:54:48.321 --> 01:54:50.571
Unmarried.

01:55:00.530 --> 01:55:02.613
One, one person.

01:55:02.987 --> 01:55:05.530
All right, all of you!

01:55:11.488 --> 01:55:14.321
All of you have to hold it in the hand.

01:55:16.029 --> 01:55:18.321
Now, hold it in your hand, all of you, here.

01:55:18.446 --> 01:55:20.154

01:55:20.488 --> 01:55:24.238
Yes, just hold it, right hand.

01:55:24.655 --> 01:55:27.988
Hold it with the right. Here, one can hold it.

01:55:30.405 --> 01:55:34.071
Now, put it.

01:55:37.571 --> 01:55:40.405
So thank you.

01:56:04.738 --> 01:56:07.780
“Pasha-hantri, Pasha-hantri” –

01:56:10.863 --> 01:56:12.738
You see, they are under bondage.

01:56:13.113 --> 01:56:17.738
She’s the one who kills all the bondages, pash.

01:56:21.446 --> 01:56:24.822
May God bless you.

01:58:55.987 --> 01:58:58.988

She is … She is kind to them like a Mother.

01:59:09.780 --> 01:59:11.446
She mothers them.

01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:14.780
