00:27:11.993 --> 00:27:21.593
Is very difficult to speak, even for Me

00:27:29.993 --> 00:27:37.073
to see so many Sahaja yogis

00:27:39.113 --> 00:27:47.473
sitting here with such shining faces

00:27:47.473 --> 00:27:50.993
from all over the world,

00:27:53.433 --> 00:28:00.633
as if My vision has taken its form today.

00:28:07.713 --> 00:28:16.353
I see in you the saviors of tomorrow

00:28:16.353 --> 00:28:20.513
who are going to save this world

00:28:20.833 --> 00:28:25.753
from all the Kali Yuga calamities

00:28:25.993 --> 00:28:29.353
that are surrounding us.

00:28:30.313 --> 00:28:34.073
Is coming from all sides,

00:28:35.033 --> 00:28:42.473
while you people have really taken your second birth

00:28:42.753 --> 00:28:46.953
from this pond of Kali Yuga

00:28:46.953 --> 00:28:52.633
and have really become beautiful lotuses of different colors,

00:28:52.633 --> 00:28:57.433
hues, fragrance and beauty.

00:28:58.073 --> 00:29:02.633
Instead of you celebrating My birthday,

00:29:02.633 --> 00:29:07.673
is better I celebrate your birthdays.

00:29:13.233 --> 00:29:15.473
As I told you the other day that

00:29:15.473 --> 00:29:25.313
it is you who are such great seekers, seekers of truth, of love,

00:29:25.313 --> 00:29:28.113
that it could work out,

00:29:30.833 --> 00:29:33.753
otherwise it would have been impossible.

00:29:33.753 --> 00:29:38.233
To even transform one person is very difficult,

00:29:38.233 --> 00:29:42.753
but you were so sensitive

00:29:42.753 --> 00:29:48.113
and so deep that this subtle knowledge,

00:29:48.113 --> 00:29:53.873
I don't know how it penetrated your being.

00:29:54.393 --> 00:29:56.433
It's unbelievable.

00:29:56.433 --> 00:30:00.313
I can't believe Myself

00:30:00.833 --> 00:30:08.353
what great people have taken birth in this Kali Yuga.

00:30:08.993 --> 00:30:12.473
No one can believe that there are so many

00:30:12.473 --> 00:30:14.993
saints are sitting before Me, so many Walis;

00:30:14.993 --> 00:30:18.713
so many Nalis are sitting before Me.

00:30:21.873 --> 00:30:27.313
In the history of spirituality it has never happened.

00:30:27.993 --> 00:30:32.273
Even in the heavens there are few devatas

00:30:32.273 --> 00:30:35.593
and devas, not so many.

00:30:36.713 --> 00:30:39.553
One better than the other

00:30:39.793 --> 00:30:46.033
such beautiful heart,

00:30:47.953 --> 00:30:52.033
such brilliant brains

00:30:52.353 --> 00:31:04.873
and such active attention, is really

00:31:04.873 --> 00:31:11.593
I thank you all that this seventieth birthday I could see

00:31:11.593 --> 00:31:16.193
so many people, which I never expected.

00:31:16.193 --> 00:31:21.033
You know, Sahaja Yoga was started with one person

00:31:21.033 --> 00:31:25.193
and then those who came also,

00:31:25.193 --> 00:31:31.033
out of them, some were power-oriented, money-oriented,

00:31:31.033 --> 00:31:35.433
all kinds of people created problems for us.

00:31:35.433 --> 00:31:38.993
One after another, so many problems came

00:31:38.993 --> 00:31:42.313
and also there were many who were

00:31:42.313 --> 00:31:46.873
of a very low-level seekers.

00:31:46.873 --> 00:31:53.233
But I find today they have all come up beautifully.

00:31:53.913 --> 00:31:59.153
I cannot distinguish one from another,

00:31:59.153 --> 00:32:01.873
the way it has happened.

00:32:01.873 --> 00:32:05.353
And the commitment you have to Sahaja Yoga

00:32:05.353 --> 00:32:11.593
is the greatest blessings for this world.

00:32:11.593 --> 00:32:17.233
I could not do it alone. You know that.

00:32:17.233 --> 00:32:22.473
If I could do it, I would not have needed you.

00:32:22.473 --> 00:32:25.433
You are the channels

00:32:25.673 --> 00:32:31.993
and you have to work it out further and further.

00:32:34.033 --> 00:32:39.433
It is really remarkable the way

00:32:39.433 --> 00:32:43.753
Delhi people have organized everything.

00:32:57.313 --> 00:33:00.393
First of all, everybody was very much

00:33:00.393 --> 00:33:03.233
keyed onto the seventieth birthday.

00:33:03.233 --> 00:33:08.553
I don't know what was the reason, but whatever it is,

00:33:08.553 --> 00:33:09.913
and then Delhi people said,

00:33:09.913 --> 00:33:11.913
"This time we are going to celebrate,

00:33:11.913 --> 00:33:14.873
Mother, Your birthday in Delhi."

00:33:15.153 --> 00:33:19.993
I said, "Everybody's ... on it, so be careful,

00:33:19.993 --> 00:33:24.033
it's not going to be easy. It's a big headache.

00:33:25.593 --> 00:33:28.353
So many will be coming down."

00:33:28.353 --> 00:33:31.953
But they didn't expect so much, I'm sure

00:33:33.833 --> 00:33:36.153
... people are coming. Hundred are coming from there,

00:33:36.153 --> 00:33:40.353
hundred from there. I said, "Are you worried?"

00:33:40.353 --> 00:33:43.673
They said, "No we are very happy about it."

00:33:43.673 --> 00:33:48.193
I saw their enthusiasm, their organization,

00:33:49.193 --> 00:33:50.873
the way they have done it.

00:33:50.873 --> 00:33:52.793
The best part of it,

00:33:53.033 --> 00:33:58.153
Delhi, which is a place where all kinds of politicians live,

00:33:58.433 --> 00:34:01.353
have groups and politics and all that,

00:34:01.353 --> 00:34:06.633
but in Sahaja Yoga in Delhi there is no politics.

00:34:16.913 --> 00:34:19.473
There is no quarrelling.

00:34:19.913 --> 00:34:22.393
There is no pulling each other's legs.

00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:25.233
Is very remarkable thing

00:34:25.233 --> 00:34:28.353
it to happen in a place like Delhi,

00:34:28.353 --> 00:34:30.473
where every day what you hear

00:34:30.473 --> 00:34:35.793
that even in our parliament they are beating each other.

00:34:37.073 --> 00:34:39.633
Perhaps, in this hell only,

00:34:39.633 --> 00:34:43.513
this goodness was to be born and

00:34:43.513 --> 00:34:46.593
to be manifested by Sahaja yogis.

00:34:46.593 --> 00:34:49.313
The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:49.313 --> 00:34:54.433
as you know, is extremely, extremely subtle

00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:59.073
and it's not easy

00:34:59.833 --> 00:35:06.593
to penetrate into the so-called

00:35:06.593 --> 00:35:10.073
people who call themselves intellectuals

00:35:10.073 --> 00:35:18.193
or who are absolutely bowed down to their conditionings.

00:35:19.033 --> 00:35:23.273
So, on one side, we have the masses who are ignorant,

00:35:23.273 --> 00:35:28.073
another side the classes who live in the frame

00:35:28.073 --> 00:35:31.713
that they have made out of their brains.

00:35:33.593 --> 00:35:37.713
Both ways, I think, they are extremely gross.

00:35:38.233 --> 00:35:44.113
But the way they have absorbed

00:35:44.113 --> 00:35:53.313
this subtle nectar of Divinity is something unbelievable.

00:35:56.153 --> 00:36:00.073
Nobody can comprehend even

00:36:02.313 --> 00:36:12.713
that there were so many born after My birth,

00:36:12.713 --> 00:36:16.193
on this Earth,

00:36:16.393 --> 00:36:21.153
or some maybe before also, very few.

00:36:21.153 --> 00:36:24.953
Just after My birth they were born here

00:36:27.713 --> 00:36:32.313
in this world, to get to Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:32.193 --> 00:36:37.713
But when I saw the world I was shocked,

00:36:37.713 --> 00:36:40.273
more shocked than Kabira, himself.

00:36:40.273 --> 00:36:45.073
I said, "How will I talk to anyone about it?"

00:36:45.633 --> 00:36:47.233
My family members,

00:36:47.233 --> 00:36:51.713
I didn't know how will I open the subject to them.

00:36:52.793 --> 00:36:59.953
Was impossible, so much was darkness of ignorance.

00:37:01.753 --> 00:37:07.553
How will they believe that there is really Divinity,

00:37:08.033 --> 00:37:12.673
there is totality waiting for them?

00:37:12.673 --> 00:37:16.793
They all believed into some sort of a religion,

00:37:16.793 --> 00:37:20.113
which had no connection with reality.

00:37:22.433 --> 00:37:27.033
And it was impossible even to envisage

00:37:27.033 --> 00:37:31.153
the method by which I could talk to them.

00:37:31.393 --> 00:37:34.273
I remember the first incident

00:37:34.273 --> 00:37:41.673
when we went to Nargol, where I had opened the Sahasrara.

00:37:42.313 --> 00:37:47.993
The first person who got realization was a Gujarati and a jeweler.

00:37:48.313 --> 00:37:51.793
Immediately, all the other,

00:37:51.793 --> 00:37:55.313
there were hardly about thirty-five people

00:37:55.313 --> 00:37:56.873
they started saying that

00:37:56.873 --> 00:37:59.673
"Of course, he's a rich man, he's a jeweler,

00:37:59.673 --> 00:38:02.473
so Mother has given him realization."

00:38:02.473 --> 00:38:06.513
I think that's the first time and last time I really got angry.

00:38:07.073 --> 00:38:10.433
I started shouting at them,

00:38:10.433 --> 00:38:12.433
"You are good for nothing, useless people,

00:38:12.433 --> 00:38:15.313
you can never take to Divinity,"

00:38:15.313 --> 00:38:18.073
and I had really thought that "Stop it now."

00:38:18.073 --> 00:38:20.593
One has to take another life,

00:38:20.593 --> 00:38:26.313
another time where people will understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:26.553 --> 00:38:31.353
But after that, suddenly,

00:38:31.353 --> 00:38:34.633
people started feeling the cool breeze in their hands,

00:38:34.633 --> 00:38:39.513
immediately, after My shouting. Imagine.

00:38:39.513 --> 00:38:46.033
And they said, "Mother, You know, it's working.

00:38:46.033 --> 00:38:48.913
It's working in us. It's working out of us."

00:38:48.913 --> 00:38:53.633
Thus, we got twelve people

00:38:53.633 --> 00:39:00.793
and one lady whom I had given before also,

00:39:01.873 --> 00:39:04.953
she was the fourteenth.

00:39:08.513 --> 00:39:12.833
Thus, first we had only these fourteen Sahaja yogis,

00:39:14.153 --> 00:39:19.713
for whom it was something out of the blue.

00:39:19.713 --> 00:39:22.313
They were all flabbergasted.

00:39:22.593 --> 00:39:25.073
They didn't know what it was.

00:39:28.273 --> 00:39:32.513
And then, surprisingly, in one of our programs,

00:39:32.513 --> 00:39:41.033
a lady who was possessed by some Brahmin came

00:39:41.233 --> 00:39:46.753
and started saying, "Jagadamba, Jagadamba."

00:39:46.753 --> 00:39:51.193
They couldn't understand. I never told them what I was, never.

00:39:51.193 --> 00:39:53.473
I've never told otherwise also.

00:39:55.193 --> 00:39:58.793
So then, she recited a poem

00:39:58.793 --> 00:40:01.673
from Saundarya Lahari in Sanskrit language

00:40:01.673 --> 00:40:04.073
and she was just a maidservant.

00:40:04.313 --> 00:40:07.313
And in a man's voice.

00:40:09.513 --> 00:40:11.313
So everybody was shocked

00:40:11.633 --> 00:40:15.073
that the bhoots should say all these things.

00:40:15.073 --> 00:40:17.633
And then she went away.

00:40:17.633 --> 00:40:22.913
After that, these people started probing into it.

00:40:23.713 --> 00:40:28.073
And they wanted to have My Puja, first time,

00:40:28.073 --> 00:40:31.233
in My house itself.

00:40:31.513 --> 00:40:39.753
Still people were not very sure they were doing the right thing.

00:40:39.753 --> 00:40:41.633
Even the Brahmins they called, they said,

00:40:41.633 --> 00:40:44.993
"This Saptasadi is a very difficult Puja

00:40:44.993 --> 00:40:48.633
and something will happen to us."

00:40:48.633 --> 00:40:50.233
But after the Puja they said,

00:40:50.593 --> 00:40:54.313
"Nothing happened, we are so much better."

00:40:54.313 --> 00:40:58.793
They all felt the cool breeze

00:40:58.793 --> 00:41:02.593
and the entire atmosphere changed.

00:41:02.593 --> 00:41:05.793
They started understanding that

00:41:05.793 --> 00:41:11.473
Sahaja Yoga is the Yuga Dharma, is the one

00:41:12.673 --> 00:41:19.673
of this yuga, this Kali Yuga,

00:41:20.353 --> 00:41:27.553
so the Sahaj Dharma became the dharma of this yuga.

00:41:30.113 --> 00:41:33.633
This yuga is very difficult, no doubt.

00:41:34.353 --> 00:41:40.873
But in difficulties only we become intense seekers

00:41:40.873 --> 00:41:46.793
and that's what happened with all of you,

00:41:46.793 --> 00:41:53.633
that you found out that everywhere

00:41:53.633 --> 00:41:56.913
people were following whatever they're following,

00:41:56.913 --> 00:42:00.753
they were not reaching any point.

00:42:00.753 --> 00:42:03.633
Like a cocoon,

00:42:03.633 --> 00:42:07.473
they're hitting their head here and there.

00:42:07.473 --> 00:42:10.753
They got their realizations

00:42:11.073 --> 00:42:15.033
so quickly and when they told Me

00:42:17.233 --> 00:42:20.353
how they were seeking, what was happening to them,

00:42:20.353 --> 00:42:24.433
I was amazed.

00:42:26.673 --> 00:42:29.793
How this seeking was working within them

00:42:29.793 --> 00:42:32.753
and pushed them towards Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:32.753 --> 00:42:34.953
Also, in the meanwhile, I must say,

00:42:34.953 --> 00:42:43.593
so many got lost into the clutches of false gurus.

00:42:43.593 --> 00:42:49.793
Despite that, today we have so many Sahaja yogis.

00:42:49.793 --> 00:42:52.593
You are just representing your country,

00:42:52.593 --> 00:42:56.513
but there are many more in your countries.

00:42:56.513 --> 00:42:59.233
Even in India we have many more.

00:42:59.233 --> 00:43:03.913
You are just here, come to represent them.

00:43:03.913 --> 00:43:06.993
So, multiple of this number,

00:43:06.993 --> 00:43:09.473
I do not know how many would be there.

00:43:09.473 --> 00:43:11.993
So many asked "Me how many Sahaja yogis there are". I said,

00:43:12.193 --> 00:43:13.873
"I don't know."

00:43:13.873 --> 00:43:14.993
Say, "You don't know?"

00:43:15.353 --> 00:43:19.753
I said, "No. We have never kept any record."

00:43:19.753 --> 00:43:22.233
So they can't understand. I said,

00:43:22.233 --> 00:43:29.393
"We have no office, no record. I have no secretary.

00:43:30.273 --> 00:43:32.393
I don't know how to type.

00:43:32.393 --> 00:43:36.113
I don't know how to write even My check."

00:43:37.033 --> 00:43:39.073
They can't understand

00:43:38.953 --> 00:43:43.193
person like Me existing in these modern times.

00:43:44.593 --> 00:43:48.313
But everything gets done, somehow.

00:43:49.433 --> 00:43:53.273
Despite all My modern ignorance,

00:43:53.273 --> 00:43:57.753
everything gets absolutely

00:43:57.753 --> 00:44:00.473
done in the most perfect manner

00:44:00.473 --> 00:44:04.593
like a remote control.

00:44:04.593 --> 00:44:07.673
Now this whole thing,

00:44:08.873 --> 00:44:14.313
I never said a word about it, I must tell you, nothing.

00:44:14.313 --> 00:44:20.113
Never I gave any idea as to how it should be.

00:44:20.113 --> 00:44:24.793
I didn't even tell them how many we are expecting.

00:44:25.873 --> 00:44:30.953
But see how spontaneously everything has worked out

00:44:30.953 --> 00:44:34.873
because you all have commitment

00:44:35.193 --> 00:44:38.513
and that commitment gives you

00:44:38.513 --> 00:44:42.913
all these organizing capacities.

00:44:46.433 --> 00:44:51.993
So many things you have seen get organized

00:44:51.993 --> 00:44:55.873
because also this Paramchaitanya

00:44:55.873 --> 00:45:00.193
has come into Krita Yuga

00:45:00.193 --> 00:45:04.433
where it is working it out. It's acting.

00:45:04.433 --> 00:45:10.073
And this activity, also, is absolutely supportive to you.

00:45:11.673 --> 00:45:14.953
For example, the police people told us

00:45:14.953 --> 00:45:17.233
that there are Muslims living here

00:45:17.233 --> 00:45:19.913
and you might have some danger from them.

00:45:19.913 --> 00:45:22.393
They might do some harm to you.

00:45:22.393 --> 00:45:24.553
I said, "Which Muslims are they?"

00:45:24.553 --> 00:45:29.193
So they said, "Nizamuddin Aulia's people are here."

00:45:30.473 --> 00:45:33.073
I said, "They'll never harm us."

00:45:33.073 --> 00:45:37.193
I said, "Why? Because he was a Sufi

00:45:37.193 --> 00:45:40.953
and he was a great realized soul

00:45:40.953 --> 00:45:46.233
and the people who are along there, must be, most of them are,

00:45:46.233 --> 00:45:50.633
at least, believers of Sufism.

00:45:50.633 --> 00:45:53.793
How can they harm us?"

00:45:53.793 --> 00:45:55.953
So I said, "Tomorrow, early in the morning,

00:45:55.953 --> 00:46:02.353
you go and put a chador, as they call it, all of you,"

00:46:02.353 --> 00:46:03.753
and they were so impressed

00:46:03.753 --> 00:46:08.873
that you saw in the evening they came here all the way,

00:46:08.873 --> 00:46:12.553
morning time, and they were so respectful.

00:46:12.553 --> 00:46:14.713
Then they called Me, they gave Me another chador,

00:46:14.713 --> 00:46:19.153
this, that and they said that we are Yours and this and that,

00:46:19.153 --> 00:46:20.953
all kinds of things.

00:46:20.953 --> 00:46:22.993
And his disciple was Amir Khusrau,

00:46:22.993 --> 00:46:26.553
was another very, very great Sufi gentleman

00:46:26.553 --> 00:46:30.273
and I always have admired his poetry

00:46:30.273 --> 00:46:36.713
and also the way Nizamuddin led his life of dignity

00:46:36.713 --> 00:46:40.913
and divinity.

00:46:39.833 --> 00:46:43.633
All these Muslims who were there put hands towards Me like this

00:46:43.633 --> 00:46:46.713
and they said, "We are feeling the cool breeze,"

00:46:46.713 --> 00:46:48.953
I said, "This is Ruh."

00:46:48.953 --> 00:46:51.713
"Ah, this is Ruh."

00:46:53.033 --> 00:46:55.713
Once these people start getting Ruh,

00:46:55.713 --> 00:46:58.233
they will all become Sahaja yogis very soon

00:46:58.233 --> 00:47:01.713
and you may have to have ...

00:47:12.833 --> 00:47:16.873
There are so many Sufis all over the world

00:47:16.873 --> 00:47:18.953
and we are going to take their addresses

00:47:18.953 --> 00:47:20.393
and we are going to meet them;

00:47:20.393 --> 00:47:23.113
then you might have to have another big pendal,

00:47:23.113 --> 00:47:26.913
double pendal I think, maybe triple.

00:47:33.193 --> 00:47:41.073
If Delhi people are not quite frightened about the sizes,

00:47:41.073 --> 00:47:45.513
I think again we'll have to have it in Delhi only.

00:48:01.593 --> 00:48:04.673
Also contemporarily,

00:48:05.313 --> 00:48:08.953
Delhi is in a state of turmoil

00:48:08.953 --> 00:48:13.753
and we should be here to pacify it, to quieten it,

00:48:13.753 --> 00:48:17.073
to give wisdom to those people

00:48:17.073 --> 00:48:20.873
who are supposed to be at the helm of affairs.

00:48:21.313 --> 00:48:25.353
It will work. Definitely, it will work.

00:48:25.353 --> 00:48:27.753
With all these Sahaja yogis

00:48:27.753 --> 00:48:30.113
emitting such beautiful, vibrations.

00:48:30.113 --> 00:48:31.593
See, on top of your head

00:48:31.593 --> 00:48:35.233
this cloth is moving up and down all the time,

00:48:35.473 --> 00:48:38.193
though there is no breeze outside,

00:48:38.193 --> 00:48:40.353
the leaves are just steady,

00:48:40.353 --> 00:48:44.833
but from your head, you see, you are moving all this.

00:48:47.833 --> 00:48:50.793
So I'm sure these vibrations

00:48:50.793 --> 00:48:55.553
will cool down and will bring peace

00:48:55.553 --> 00:49:00.313
to our politicians and to the people

00:49:00.313 --> 00:49:04.713
who are at the helm of affairs.

00:49:04.713 --> 00:49:08.993
At this juncture, when in the whole world

00:49:08.993 --> 00:49:13.473
there are so many things going on

00:49:13.473 --> 00:49:16.433
of uncertainties,

00:49:16.833 --> 00:49:19.913
say in Russia, there are uncertainties,

00:49:19.913 --> 00:49:23.073
Bosnia there is uncertainties,

00:49:23.073 --> 00:49:26.073
in England there's recession,

00:49:26.073 --> 00:49:28.233
America there is recession,

00:49:28.513 --> 00:49:30.313
Spain there is recession,

00:49:30.313 --> 00:49:33.113
everybody is suffering from the pangs

00:49:33.393 --> 00:49:39.153
of some sort of a extreme behavior they went into.

00:49:39.673 --> 00:49:42.233
So, I'm sure this polarity

00:49:42.233 --> 00:49:45.433
that they see now will correct

00:49:45.793 --> 00:49:49.633
their behavior towards materialism

00:49:49.633 --> 00:49:55.313
and I'm sure that a balance will be struck.

00:49:55.553 --> 00:49:59.233
With your good wishes, with your prayers,

00:49:59.233 --> 00:50:06.313
this world will be so beautiful,

00:50:06.313 --> 00:50:15.273
so enchanting that in the history,

00:50:15.273 --> 00:50:17.593
people will describe

00:50:17.593 --> 00:50:21.233
that the world itself became a lotus

00:50:21.233 --> 00:50:26.593
full of fragrance of Divinity.

00:50:34.873 --> 00:50:37.353
You are the petals,

00:50:38.833 --> 00:50:41.073
you are the corona,

00:50:43.593 --> 00:50:46.073
you are the color,

00:50:47.153 --> 00:50:49.633
you are the beauty,

00:50:51.193 --> 00:50:53.113
you are the pollen

00:50:53.873 --> 00:50:57.793
of that beautiful lotus

00:51:00.953 --> 00:51:04.513
which is My vision of this world.

00:51:04.513 --> 00:51:07.353
I hope today

00:51:07.353 --> 00:51:13.873
you all will decide to work for Sahaja Yoga,

00:51:13.873 --> 00:51:15.313
to spread Sahaja Yoga

00:51:15.313 --> 00:51:19.113
and work for yourself also.

00:51:19.353 --> 00:51:21.273
The only danger is

00:51:21.273 --> 00:51:26.313
that one should not allow ego to sit on your heads.

00:51:26.553 --> 00:51:31.353
That's the only horse.

00:51:31.353 --> 00:51:36.153
If you could ride yourself and don't allow the horse to ride you,

00:51:36.153 --> 00:51:38.433
you'll progress very fast,

00:51:38.433 --> 00:51:41.633
beautifully.

00:51:44.713 --> 00:51:52.673
Thus, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread.

00:51:52.673 --> 00:52:01.233
Every birthday we have to take a vow.

00:52:01.513 --> 00:52:06.673
I don't know what vow I should take.

00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:12.473
People have told Me that I should not work so hard,

00:52:12.473 --> 00:52:14.353
I'm working very hard,

00:52:14.353 --> 00:52:18.713
but I have taken a vow that I'll work double hard.

00:52:26.833 --> 00:52:28.713
In the same way, you also,

00:52:28.713 --> 00:52:31.593
all of you, have to take a vow today

00:52:31.593 --> 00:52:36.433
that we'll go all out in the commitment

00:52:36.433 --> 00:52:39.673
of working of Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:39.673 --> 00:52:42.553
We'll think about it.

00:52:42.553 --> 00:52:45.393
There are scientists who should produce books,

00:52:45.393 --> 00:52:48.073
there are doctors who should produce books,

00:52:48.073 --> 00:52:49.553
writings,

00:52:49.553 --> 00:52:50.873
go round,

00:52:50.873 --> 00:52:52.793
talk to their colleagues,

00:52:52.793 --> 00:52:56.753
organize meetings,

00:52:56.753 --> 00:53:00.273
seminars with your colleagues.

00:53:02.673 --> 00:53:05.553
There are architects

00:53:06.513 --> 00:53:11.073
and other professionals

00:53:11.633 --> 00:53:16.993
who could call their colleagues and give them realization.

00:53:16.993 --> 00:53:19.713
Even the people who are dealing with finances

00:53:19.713 --> 00:53:22.233
should take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:22.233 --> 00:53:25.833
Is very important because

00:53:25.833 --> 00:53:30.073
financial problems can only be

00:53:30.233 --> 00:53:32.953
solved by the Divine Power.

00:53:32.953 --> 00:53:36.513
Nobody else can solve it.

00:53:36.913 --> 00:53:40.673
So everyone in this world,

00:53:40.673 --> 00:53:46.113
whether it is law or any other field,

00:53:46.113 --> 00:53:51.353
all of you should take to Sahaja Yoga

00:53:52.233 --> 00:53:56.873
and also to creative work.

00:53:57.793 --> 00:54:02.193
Then also, you have to take Sahaja Yoga

00:54:02.193 --> 00:54:04.673
to your surroundings,

00:54:04.673 --> 00:54:11.193
to villages, to cities,

00:54:11.193 --> 00:54:14.233
wherever it is possible,

00:54:14.233 --> 00:54:16.633
wherever you can organize,

00:54:16.633 --> 00:54:20.513
you have to spread Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

00:54:20.513 --> 00:54:23.233
As far as curing is concerned,

00:54:23.233 --> 00:54:26.593
I would advise, you don't have to touch anyone.

00:54:26.593 --> 00:54:29.393
Please use only My photograph.

00:54:29.393 --> 00:54:32.233
That's how you'll get more Sahaja yogis

00:54:32.233 --> 00:54:36.673
and less sick people.

00:54:36.673 --> 00:54:39.193
Also, people will be cured

00:54:39.193 --> 00:54:42.953
and all of them will become Sahaja yogis.

00:54:43.233 --> 00:54:46.553
We have also agricultural field

00:54:46.553 --> 00:54:48.993
on which we have done something,

00:54:48.993 --> 00:54:54.393
but much can be done about agriculture.

00:54:54.393 --> 00:54:57.073
One should see the government and tell them

00:54:57.073 --> 00:54:59.473
what agriculture can do.

00:54:59.473 --> 00:55:02.553
You can form a committee and go and see them

00:55:04.873 --> 00:55:06.673
and talk to them that

00:55:06.673 --> 00:55:12.593
how agriculture can be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

00:55:12.593 --> 00:55:15.233
We have to help our children.

00:55:15.233 --> 00:55:17.593
We have to look after them

00:55:17.593 --> 00:55:26.793
because you know what sort of future is surrounding them,

00:55:26.793 --> 00:55:29.993
what sort of atmosphere is crawling,

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:33.433
even in India.

00:55:33.433 --> 00:55:37.233
So we have to see that our children

00:55:37.233 --> 00:55:40.473
properly grow in Sahaj culture.

00:55:41.753 --> 00:55:43.753
Is very important

00:55:43.753 --> 00:55:47.593
because they are tomorrow's Sahaja yogis.

00:55:47.593 --> 00:55:50.433
So many of them are born realized,

00:55:50.433 --> 00:55:53.113
so we have to discipline them properly

00:55:53.113 --> 00:55:58.753
and we have to make them aala, "aala darza"

00:55:58.753 --> 00:56:03.313
Sahaja yogi, as described in the qawali.

00:56:07.793 --> 00:56:14.753
It is also our family life which is very important.

00:56:14.993 --> 00:56:16.793
Is shocking that

00:56:16.793 --> 00:56:20.353
family life is nowadays becoming

00:56:20.353 --> 00:56:24.273
a kind of a stupid thing.

00:56:24.273 --> 00:56:27.473
No one understands the importance of it.

00:56:27.473 --> 00:56:31.033
In Sahaja Yoga we have to understand.

00:56:31.033 --> 00:56:35.753
Small quarrels, fights, should be given up.

00:56:35.753 --> 00:56:41.113
Harshness must be given up, cruelty must be given up

00:56:41.073 --> 00:56:46.993
and there should be a proper rapport

00:56:46.993 --> 00:56:54.553
between husband and wife to begin with,

00:56:54.553 --> 00:56:58.193
so that there is a companionship

00:56:58.193 --> 00:57:01.513
and the children also see that companionship

00:57:01.513 --> 00:57:05.433
and enjoy it.

00:57:06.593 --> 00:57:10.033
In our dress, in our life,

00:57:10.033 --> 00:57:14.913
we have to be dignified and decent, respecting our body.

00:57:15.633 --> 00:57:17.393
Is very important.

00:57:17.593 --> 00:57:19.873
We should wear whatever suits us

00:57:19.873 --> 00:57:22.633
in whatever country we are.

00:57:23.393 --> 00:57:25.673
I mean, imagine in summer climate

00:57:25.673 --> 00:57:28.433
if somebody wants to wear a three-piece suit,

00:57:28.673 --> 00:57:30.873
what will happen to him?

00:57:31.553 --> 00:57:33.153
Whatever suits us,

00:57:33.153 --> 00:57:37.473
whatever fits our culture,

00:57:37.473 --> 00:57:42.033
one should try to wear decent dresses,

00:57:42.033 --> 00:57:44.753
traditional dresses.

00:57:44.993 --> 00:57:47.553
Specially for women, it is very important

00:57:47.553 --> 00:57:52.393
to wear dresses that will make them look more dignified.

00:57:59.473 --> 00:58:02.673
Also, another point I would like to say,

00:58:02.673 --> 00:58:07.553
that ladies, specially, must take to reading,

00:58:08.233 --> 00:58:11.073
at least newspapers.

00:58:11.393 --> 00:58:15.233
If your attention is on the problems

00:58:15.233 --> 00:58:18.833
that are in this world, it's very effective

00:58:18.833 --> 00:58:23.673
because you know your attention is active, it works.

00:58:25.473 --> 00:58:27.993
So use your attention.

00:58:27.993 --> 00:58:29.473
You see the newspapers,

00:58:29.473 --> 00:58:32.113
you watch -- I know it's horrifying sometimes

00:58:32.113 --> 00:58:33.913
you can give a bandhan,

00:58:33.913 --> 00:58:37.273
but you must see what's happening where,

00:58:37.273 --> 00:58:40.073
is very important.

00:58:40.073 --> 00:58:44.993
Also men should not just read something sensational,

00:58:44.993 --> 00:58:48.153
but read something that's happening

00:58:48.153 --> 00:58:51.553
and also think, what are the solutions.

00:58:51.553 --> 00:58:54.953
How can you people, as Sahaja yogis, help it,

00:58:54.953 --> 00:58:58.233
in a collective way or in an individual way.

00:58:58.233 --> 00:59:06.033
We have to solve many problems of this modern world.

00:59:06.033 --> 00:59:09.113
Also one has to read good books,

00:59:09.113 --> 00:59:12.153
good films one has to see,

00:59:12.153 --> 00:59:14.873
and have your reflection on them.

00:59:14.873 --> 00:59:16.833
Keep your mind alert.

00:59:16.833 --> 00:59:21.073
There are many beautiful poems I've read recently

00:59:21.073 --> 00:59:22.553
coming out of

00:59:22.553 --> 00:59:25.473
some people where I never expected they will write poems,

00:59:25.473 --> 00:59:28.033
beautiful, very high class.

00:59:28.233 --> 00:59:31.513
So this poetry also, we are going to collect.

00:59:31.513 --> 00:59:34.633
We are going to collect all the miraculous photographs

00:59:34.633 --> 00:59:36.153
from everywhere.

00:59:36.153 --> 00:59:39.553
They are trying to systematize now.

00:59:39.553 --> 00:59:41.513
And now, in this system,

00:59:41.513 --> 00:59:44.153
if you can all help spontaneously,

00:59:44.153 --> 00:59:48.593
it will be a great achievement

00:59:48.593 --> 00:59:52.113
because, so far, we have not been able to collect

00:59:52.113 --> 00:59:56.313
all these datas and keep them with us.

00:59:58.233 --> 01:00:01.353
Now the best is that you all must meditate.

01:00:01.353 --> 01:00:04.073
All have to meditate.

01:00:04.073 --> 01:00:06.833
Only in meditation you are in present

01:00:06.833 --> 01:00:09.633
and you grow in your spirituality.

01:00:09.633 --> 01:00:13.633
I've said it many a times, but people just don't do it.

01:00:13.633 --> 01:00:17.193
About ten minutes, if you can meditate

01:00:17.193 --> 01:00:20.793
before sleeping, it's of a very great help to you,

01:00:21.993 --> 01:00:23.673
no doubt.

01:00:24.033 --> 01:00:25.753
We really grow very fast.

01:00:25.753 --> 01:00:28.553
Immediately I know this man is meditating,

01:00:28.553 --> 01:00:30.713
the way he has changed.

01:00:30.713 --> 01:00:32.513
And then, once you get used to it,

01:00:32.753 --> 01:00:35.233
you'll never give it up.

01:00:35.233 --> 01:00:37.193
Is very simple meditation.

01:00:37.193 --> 01:00:39.953
You have foot soaking or something like that

01:00:39.953 --> 01:00:43.073
and in the morning you should beat your ego,

01:00:43.073 --> 01:00:44.753
that's all.

01:00:45.513 --> 01:00:47.793
Is not that you have to do

01:00:47.793 --> 01:00:51.233
one lakh jappas or something.

01:00:51.233 --> 01:00:52.713
Nothing of the kind.

01:00:52.713 --> 01:00:54.433
Is very simple.

01:00:54.433 --> 01:00:56.633
But this, you have to do for yourself,

01:00:56.633 --> 01:01:02.953
to respect your Self-realization and your growth in divinity.

01:01:05.433 --> 01:01:12.193
We have lots of advantages over others.

01:01:12.193 --> 01:01:14.473
But one thing I have to tell you,

01:01:14.473 --> 01:01:19.673
those people who are not prone to seeking,

01:01:19.673 --> 01:01:23.233
please don't talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:23.233 --> 01:01:26.233
Don't waste your energy on such people,

01:01:26.233 --> 01:01:28.233
discussing and arguing,

01:01:28.233 --> 01:01:30.993
because it cannot be discussed much.

01:01:30.993 --> 01:01:33.673
You just forget them and leave them alone.

01:01:33.673 --> 01:01:35.273
I'll look after them.

01:01:35.273 --> 01:01:39.073
You just take to simple people, good people,

01:01:39.073 --> 01:01:43.153
who are seeking the truth.

01:01:43.153 --> 01:01:45.713
I don't want you to break your necks with those people

01:01:45.713 --> 01:01:49.473
who are just believing in discussion,

01:01:49.393 --> 01:01:52.833
arguments and shabda jaal.

01:01:52.833 --> 01:01:57.153
Today the Sahaja Yoga culture is so much manifesting

01:01:57.153 --> 01:02:00.273
that people, once they see you, they immediately know

01:02:00.273 --> 01:02:02.793
there's something special

01:02:03.033 --> 01:02:07.833
and that they have something very unique

01:02:07.833 --> 01:02:13.633
qualities among them which you seldom find with normal people.

01:02:13.633 --> 01:02:16.193
All these things, you should understand,

01:02:16.193 --> 01:02:19.313
have come to you spontaneously from within,

01:02:19.313 --> 01:02:22.873
but you must preserve them and you should never feel shy of them.

01:02:22.873 --> 01:02:26.353
Should never be shy of your virtues.

01:02:27.673 --> 01:02:29.513
And whatever people may try

01:02:29.513 --> 01:02:31.913
to tell you that "You better do this and better do that"

01:02:31.913 --> 01:02:33.873
if it is wrong you should never do it.

01:02:32.553 --> 01:02:38.713
Because, now, you are very powerful

01:02:33.873 --> 01:02:36.473
Should just say, "I don't want to do it."

01:02:43.673 --> 01:02:45.913
and that you have to lead the people

01:02:45.913 --> 01:02:47.593
and people don't have to lead you.

01:02:47.593 --> 01:02:49.553
Fashions don't have to lead you,

01:02:49.553 --> 01:02:52.033
but you have to create fashions.

01:02:52.033 --> 01:02:55.753
You have to create a path for them.

01:02:55.753 --> 01:02:58.633
It's not that you have to

01:02:58.633 --> 01:03:02.593
trod on the path that they have made.

01:03:02.593 --> 01:03:04.033
Try to understand

01:03:04.033 --> 01:03:07.393
that your own personality

01:03:07.393 --> 01:03:12.593
is of a level where you can see so many subtle things

01:03:12.593 --> 01:03:16.233
and you are so powerful, that others don't see,

01:03:16.233 --> 01:03:21.473
then you have to automatically take up their leadership.

01:03:21.473 --> 01:03:23.553
Don't get ideas from them

01:03:23.553 --> 01:03:25.193
and don't get frightened

01:03:25.193 --> 01:03:27.673
when they try to tell you something

01:03:27.673 --> 01:03:30.593
against yourself or against Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:30.593 --> 01:03:35.713
Be sure. Be confident. That is how it is going to work out.

01:03:35.713 --> 01:03:38.633
Now, I'm just a woman and a housewife,

01:03:38.633 --> 01:03:42.033
but I was so sure about Sahaja Yoga

01:03:42.033 --> 01:03:45.033
that it worked out.

01:03:46.913 --> 01:03:48.393
I didn't have to,

01:03:48.393 --> 01:03:52.593
sort of, think whether I should do it or not.

01:03:52.593 --> 01:03:57.233
I just started it.

01:03:57.673 --> 01:04:00.393
Though in the family it was not so much respected,

01:04:00.593 --> 01:04:04.313
not so much agreed to, doesn't matter.

01:04:04.313 --> 01:04:07.353
I started the whole thing on My own,

01:04:07.353 --> 01:04:09.193
worked it out on My own,

01:04:09.193 --> 01:04:12.513
because I had complete confidence in the truth,

01:04:12.513 --> 01:04:15.833
that if I am standing on the truth it will help Me

01:04:15.833 --> 01:04:18.913
and it will help all those who will come to Me.

01:04:18.913 --> 01:04:20.993
It has happened.

01:04:20.993 --> 01:04:23.953
So for you, it should not be difficult at all.

01:04:23.953 --> 01:04:25.753
All of you should, first of all,

01:04:25.753 --> 01:04:28.073
see that you are not a conditioned person

01:04:28.073 --> 01:04:30.353
and you do not have an ego

01:04:30.353 --> 01:04:33.233
and then you should go ahead with it

01:04:33.233 --> 01:04:36.593
and you'll be amazed how things will work out.

01:04:36.593 --> 01:04:40.353
Today's puja is very short puja.

01:04:40.633 --> 01:04:44.833
That's why I gave you a long lecture.

01:04:45.193 --> 01:04:48.473
There are so many things which I cannot,

01:04:48.473 --> 01:04:54.233
at this time, which is short, tell you

01:04:54.233 --> 01:04:57.193
but if you sit down, you can easily make

01:04:57.193 --> 01:05:01.313
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight yourself.

01:05:01.313 --> 01:05:04.673
So, now put your mind to it

01:05:04.673 --> 01:05:09.193
in a way that you are the organizer.

01:05:09.193 --> 01:05:11.953
Then what should you do? What can you do?

01:05:11.953 --> 01:05:13.233
What are you going to achieve?

01:05:13.233 --> 01:05:17.873
Please try and it will work out.

01:05:18.553 --> 01:05:20.353
All of you can do it.

01:05:20.353 --> 01:05:23.393
I think best is to make a diary for yourself

01:05:23.393 --> 01:05:26.433
and write it down in that: what you have done,

01:05:26.433 --> 01:05:28.513
how many people you have given realization,

01:05:28.513 --> 01:05:33.153
how many got cured, what do you think about them.

01:05:33.153 --> 01:05:35.713
But now, if there's no diary,

01:05:35.713 --> 01:05:37.033
Sahaja yogis can say among,

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:40.113
"Mother, we have no diary, so we'll start it tomorrow." No,

01:05:40.113 --> 01:05:43.153
you start it today.

01:05:44.873 --> 01:05:47.513
Only trouble with Sahaja yogis

01:05:47.513 --> 01:05:51.433
is that they take things little lightly.

01:05:54.473 --> 01:05:58.833
Of course, that is their character.

01:05:58.833 --> 01:06:02.393
But not Sahaja Yoga.

01:06:02.393 --> 01:06:04.673
Other things you can take lightly.

01:06:04.673 --> 01:06:06.433
If somebody shouts at you,

01:06:06.433 --> 01:06:07.913
somebody gets angry with you,

01:06:07.913 --> 01:06:10.473
somebody even slaps you, take it lightly.

01:06:10.473 --> 01:06:13.433
Doesn't matter, makes no difference to you,

01:06:13.433 --> 01:06:15.393
because you are the spirit.

01:06:15.393 --> 01:06:16.993
Nothing can destroy the spirit.

01:06:16.993 --> 01:06:19.873
Nainam Chidanti Shastrani.

01:06:21.673 --> 01:06:24.233
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga,

01:06:24.233 --> 01:06:26.513
your attitude should be different.

01:06:26.513 --> 01:06:28.713
If you are relaxing on one side,

01:06:28.913 --> 01:06:32.073
another side you have to be dynamic

01:06:32.073 --> 01:06:34.953
and that side is where you have to put forward

01:06:34.953 --> 01:06:36.513
the theories of Sahaja Yoga,

01:06:36.513 --> 01:06:38.273
when you have to talk to people,

01:06:38.273 --> 01:06:40.553
you have to organize a press conference

01:06:40.553 --> 01:06:42.673
or whatever sort of thing you want to do.

01:06:42.673 --> 01:06:44.673
At whatever level you want to work it out,

01:06:44.673 --> 01:06:47.113
please make a proper plan about it

01:06:47.113 --> 01:06:49.233
and just do it.

01:06:49.233 --> 01:06:53.593
It will all work out. I'm sure it will work out.

01:06:53.913 --> 01:06:59.273
With all these ideas that I have,

01:07:00.393 --> 01:07:03.393
you have many more

01:07:03.393 --> 01:07:07.353
and I hope by next year,

01:07:07.353 --> 01:07:10.073
we'll see manifestation of those.

01:07:10.073 --> 01:07:12.233
I hope many people will write books

01:07:12.233 --> 01:07:14.553
like U.C. Rai has written.

01:07:14.553 --> 01:07:20.473
I'm sure books can be written by every doctor.

01:07:20.473 --> 01:07:23.313
Doctor U.C. Rai has worked single-handed.

01:07:23.313 --> 01:07:26.033
Everything he has done single-handed.

01:07:26.033 --> 01:07:28.753
So beautifully he has worked it out.

01:07:28.753 --> 01:07:34.233
So, everybody can publish a book with their experiences,

01:07:34.513 --> 01:07:37.513
with their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

01:07:37.313 --> 01:07:40.473
which will help Sahaja yogis also.

01:07:40.553 --> 01:07:45.593
But it should be honest, very honest book.

01:07:45.593 --> 01:07:48.993
I'm sure such a book will be very much appreciated

01:07:48.993 --> 01:07:53.593
in Sahaja Yoga and we would like to publish such books also.

01:07:53.593 --> 01:07:55.793
All those who have such ideas

01:07:55.793 --> 01:08:01.393
should make an effort to create some new books,

01:08:01.393 --> 01:08:06.633
some new ideas, some new creation.

01:08:06.633 --> 01:08:08.673
Is very important

01:08:08.673 --> 01:08:10.713
because in these modern times

01:08:10.713 --> 01:08:13.993
people want to do something new,

01:08:13.993 --> 01:08:16.913
something novel.

01:08:17.513 --> 01:08:19.713
Under these circumstances,

01:08:19.713 --> 01:08:22.513
I'm sure you all will work out.

01:08:23.153 --> 01:08:26.593
So, all the time we have to think about Sahaja Yoga

01:08:26.593 --> 01:08:31.713
and jot it down whatever ideas are coming into your mind

01:08:31.713 --> 01:08:35.553
and then these can be properly put together,

01:08:35.553 --> 01:08:39.513
making a beautiful book of Sahaja Yoga.

01:08:39.513 --> 01:08:42.513
Ladies also have lots of chances of doing

01:08:42.513 --> 01:08:45.793
so many things for Sahaja Yoga.

01:08:49.873 --> 01:08:53.433
This is a very opportune time.

01:08:53.793 --> 01:09:02.513
I think Satya Yuga is starting from tomorrow. No doubt.

01:09:19.753 --> 01:09:23.553
And what will be the symptom

01:09:23.553 --> 01:09:29.473
that now the satya will be victorious, vijaya.

01:09:38.233 --> 01:09:40.513
Whatever people may try,

01:09:40.513 --> 01:09:43.433
ultimately satya will be vijaya.

01:09:43.433 --> 01:09:44.913
Satyame vijayate.

01:09:44.913 --> 01:09:49.833
That's going to happen and you are responsible.

01:09:52.923 --> 01:09:55.963
For this I congratulate you again and again.

01:09:55.963 --> 01:09:59.643
And I hope you will have the commitment to do that.

01:09:59.643 --> 01:10:03.203
May God bless you all.
