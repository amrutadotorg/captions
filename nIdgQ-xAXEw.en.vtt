00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.600
Thank you very much Nigel.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.500
Okay.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.100
So as Nigel said,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.000
I will tell you about
the medical aspects of Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.300
As we've heard,
Sahaja Yoga is a spiritual method

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.500
but it has been
associated with health benefits.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.000
So I will tell you about
the effects on the body,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
on the brain,
on your health and on diseases:

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.500
mental and physical diseases.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.200
First of all,
what is meditation?

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.870
And Nigel has already explained
more or less what meditation is,

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.500
I will just say a few more words.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.400
So, if you read
the Oxford dictionary,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.100
it says that meditation
is thinking in silence.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.000
Now first of all,
you cannot think aloud

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.500
and secondly thinking is of course
the exact opposite of what meditation is,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.500
as originally conceived in the East.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.480
So meditation,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.000
Patanjali was one of the first
to talk about meditation

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.700
and he said that meditation
is the cessation of thinking,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.800
it's the stopping of your thoughts,
it's the control of your thoughts,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.000
the control of your attention.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.100
In the West we know there are
three states of consciousness,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.600
that's sleeping,
dreaming and thinking.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.500
But in the East,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.000
and we think that thinking is
the highest state of consciousness,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
but in the East it's very common knowledge
that there's another state of consciousness

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's called
the fourth state of consciousness.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Turiya awastha

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and the fourth state of consciousness
is the state of Thoughtless Awareness.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Mental Silence.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Where you learn
to stop your thinking.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And this process of stopping your thinking

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
has amazing benefits at the subjective level

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
but also objectively and you feel,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
when your thoughts are stopped you feel happy,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
you feel joy and depending on the intensity,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
you can feel absolute bliss.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So there are several subjective correlates,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
what you feel when you meditate,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
which are listed here

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and which, however, have health implications.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And as I said before,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.500
in the West we are not really interested in spiritual things

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.000
but we are very much interested in our health

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and in fact, we are obsessed with our health.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And it's the health benefits which have 
actually attracted all the interest in Western science.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So over the last years there have been a lot of studies on meditation

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
because people have realised,
meditation actually leads to better health.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And, so what you feel when you meditate,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.500
you feel an overwhelming calmness

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.500
and this is a calmness which goes
much more beyond normal relaxation.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.800
Because when you relax, 
you relax the body and if you lie on the sofa, 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.640
you may be relaxed, but if you worry about the future
you are not really relaxed. 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.820
So, when you're thoughtless,
you don't just relax the body, 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.620
you also relax the mind and your brain
and you cannot do it with any other way. 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.400
You can only do it by stopping to think.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.220
Stopping to worry about the future,
stopping to rumenate about the past 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.120
and be in the present.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.100
So, this overwhelming feeling
of peace within, calmness, 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.420
is associated with stress relief
and I'll show you later how.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.340
When you are mentally silent,
you have a better mental balance.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.300
And this is - because if you think
about it - all mental disorders

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.680
are actually characterised by thought
problems.  

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.100
If you have schizophrenia
you have paranoid thoughts. 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.740
If you are obsessive-compulsive
you have obsessive thoughts.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.320
If you are ADHD you have racing
thoughts and if you are depressed

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.480
you have negative thoughts which you ruminate about.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.660
So, it has also been shown that all disorders,
all mental disorders they have more mental clutter.  

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.700
This has been shown over recent years.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.960
And meditation of course is
the reduction of the mental clutter.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:56.060
Because that's what it is, you stop
your thinking so you have less mental clutter.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.960
So therefore, mental silence is a state
of super mental balance.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.880
More than normal people have, because
if you meditate and you have less mental

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.100
clutter than a normal person, then
you are super healthy, and super balanced mentally.

00:04:09.194 --> 00:04:15.354
When you don't have any thoughts, you are much
more concentrated and you are much 

00:04:15.354 --> 00:04:20.534
more alert because your are pure consciousness without the content, which are the thoughts and the emotions.

00:04:20.534 --> 00:04:24.134
And if you go through life, the whole day you
throw out your thoughts and your 

00:04:24.134 --> 00:04:28.214
emotions into the world and you don't
really see reality as it really is.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.000
Because you constantly have the intermediation
of your thoughts and your emotions.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.080
So, when you have no thoughts -
you absorb reality as it really is.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.440
So for example, if you're now listening to me you may
be thinking about the dinner later

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.100
and you may have to inhibit your thoughts
in order to actually listen or attend.

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.100
If you have no thoughts,
you absorb information much quicker.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.780
And it has been shown that children who meditate
have better attention at school,

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.400
Zen Buddhists who have meditated for a long time
have better attention and

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.700
this has been associated with better productivity at work,
because when you are more concentrated

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.180
and have no mental clutter,
you are actually more focused.

00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:13.121
Another very interesting feature which I have said before,
when you have no thoughts

00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:20.781
you feel happy, you feel bliss, you feel joy
 and this, of course, you, if you have these

00:05:20.781 --> 00:05:26.021
positive emotions during your meditation because
it's so peaceful it's so pleasant this

00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:33.021
state of mental silence, then you carry this over
into daily life and this leads to more positive emotions.

00:05:33.021 --> 00:05:37.500
And positive emotions of course protect you
against depression, anxiety, affective

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.280
disorders and that's of course very good for you
and you have less negative thinking.

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.480
Last but absolutely not least, to me
this is the most important aspect of meditation,

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.760
you achieve a state
of emotional detachment.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.980
You enter a witness state, where you actually go
beyond your thoughts, because you're

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.820
no longer thinking and you're no longer having
your emotions but you see them from a

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.080
stepping-back witness state.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.320
We call it in psychology a meta-cognitive awareness,
where you're beyond your thoughts.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.460
And you can observe them.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.780
And that's, I think, the most important thing
 of meditation, the most important aspect

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.860
and, if you remember, Buddha went out to find
meditation because he realised that

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.220
there is a lot of suffering in the world.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.760
And how do you deal with the suffering?

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.500
You cannot control the life events.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.840
We all have negative life events, you know: 
your parents are going to die eventually,

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.620
people you love may die, you might have
a divorce, whatever happens to you,

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.560
you cannot really control those life events.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.700
But what you can control is how you actually
deal with those life events and how you perceive them.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.960
You can control your state of mind.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.040
And your thoughts and your emotions.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.880
And that we do by meditation
and that's the only way.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:55.400
Only through meditation we can actually enter
a witness state, which makes you

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.440
emotionally more resilient and I think this is 
the most important aspect of meditation

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.480
because, who wouldn't want to be happy
and sail through life in a sort of serene, happy,

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:11.680
joyful way, without being carried away on a roller - coaster
of emotions constantly, depending on what happens to you.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.380
So, I think this is crucial.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.180
And of course, the state of meditation,
of thoughtless awareness you may have seen

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.620
has been described
in all mystical traditions of world cultures.

00:07:25.874 --> 00:07:32.174
Here are just a few names: Nirvana, Sahaj Samadhi,
Satori, Yoga - which means union,

00:07:32.174 --> 00:07:38.534
Zen, Tao, and in the west we had our own meditation,
our own tradition of mental

00:07:38.534 --> 00:07:43.394
silence, which were the Christian Gnostics 
and Gnosis means knowledge.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.520
Which means the knowledge of your Self.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.960
And your Self, you're not just these thoughts
and these emotions, but you're a different

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:55.480
thing, you're actually a spiritual person 
who can go beyond the thoughts and emotions.

00:07:57.442 --> 00:08:02.602
So the claims I will try to prove to you today 
and show you medical evidence, is that

00:08:02.602 --> 00:08:08.342
meditation has an effect on the body, 
because mental silence reduces stress and it

00:08:08.342 --> 00:08:13.782
activates the parasympathetic nervous 
system, which restores bodily functions.

00:08:13.782 --> 00:08:20.342
I will show you that meditation has an 
effect on the brain: mental silence is a different

00:08:20.342 --> 00:08:25.262
state of consciousness, you activate 
different areas of the brain, of deep attention,

00:08:25.262 --> 00:08:32.002
of positive emotions, and there is a release of 
happy chemicals, which make you joyful.

00:08:32.394 --> 00:08:38.534
Now, meditation is a good way to prevent 
illness because mental silence leads to better

00:08:38.534 --> 00:08:40.414
physical and mental health.

00:08:40.548 --> 00:08:45.828
And lastly, I will show you that you can use 
it as a therapy, so if you have any mental,

00:08:45.828 --> 00:08:50.128
or physical - problems, you can actually solve them with meditation.
