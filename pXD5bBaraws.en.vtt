How to Meditate, Bombay
29 May 1976.

00:07.400 --> 00:16.500
I told you at Dadar, how in Sahaja Yoga, you first go into the state of Tadatmya(oneness with the Divine).

00:17.150 --> 00:26.570
After the Tadatmya  one can attain the stage of Samipya(Nearness to God) and then Salokya(Companionship with God).

00:27.800 --> 00:32.500
But on achieving Tadatmya,

00:33.300 --> 00:36.520
a person’s interest itself changes.

00:36.820 --> 00:44.250
Immediately on achieving the state of Tadatmya, due to his experiences,

00:45.020 --> 00:50.900
a person does not wish to go down into the state of Salokya and Samipya.

00:51.520 --> 00:57.250
That means, when vibrations start flowing into your hands

00:57.650 --> 01:01.620
and when you feel other’s Kundalini

01:01.920 --> 01:06.500
and can raise their Kundalini,

01:07.020 --> 01:10.500
then your chitta (attention)

01:11.650 --> 01:15.950
goes towards watching other’s Kundalini

01:15.950 --> 01:19.000
and understanding your own.

01:19.370 --> 01:25.720
You want to be alert about your chakras and understand other’s chakras.

01:26.100 --> 01:30.920
If you look up towards the sky, you may see – even if there are clouds

01:31.400 --> 01:37.820
you will see many types of Kundalini.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.320
Because, now  your attention has gone to Kundalini,

01:41.320 --> 01:46.270
whatever you want to know about Kundalini, whatever you want to see,

01:46.400 --> 01:48.600
whatever desires you have,

01:48.900 --> 01:50.900
these will be revealed to you.

01:56.320 --> 02:01.220
Your interest in Kundalini grows

02:01.550 --> 02:05.020
and all other interests disappear by themselves.

02:05.020 --> 02:11.970
Try to understand thus : As you enter into adulthood, leaving behind the childhood,

02:12.500 --> 02:17.900
you have the interests of your adult life - your job, business, wife, family;

02:26.050 --> 02:30.950
you take interest only in these and all other childhood interests drop off,

02:38.550 --> 02:45.470
old experiences fade away and your attention goes towards new experiences.

02:47.100 --> 02:53.100
Or try to understand this way: Say, a person is not interested in music,

02:53.470 --> 02:56.870
and somehow he has become interested in music, in classical music,

02:56.870 --> 02:59.500
then he is not going to enjoy

02:59.500 --> 03:06.100
any other non-classical music concert.

03:07.550 --> 03:13.550
Your condition in Sahaja Yoga should also be similar.

03:14.620 --> 03:21.470
As regards your other habits and interests,

03:21.950 --> 03:26.620
they are acquired gradually and intentionally cultivated

03:27.050 --> 03:31.350
and hence those interests are deeply imbibed in you.

03:31.820 --> 03:38.800
Sahaja Yoga has brought about a complete transformation in you,

03:39.870 --> 03:44.100
– you have come into a state of new awareness,

03:44.400 --> 03:48.400
you can now feel the vibrations and other’s Kundalini,

03:48.400 --> 03:52.750
you can give realization to many people, you have cured thousands of people,

03:53.470 --> 03:56.170
you have entered into a new power

03:56.500 --> 04:00.600
and you are nourished by it.

04:00.950 --> 04:04.500
But in doing all this there is only one shortcoming,

04:04.500 --> 04:07.920
and that is that you have not made any effort and everything has happened by itself, effortlessly.

04:08.300 --> 04:11.270
Perhaps that’s the reason why, although

04:11.470 --> 04:15.950
many people receive vibrations in Sahaja Yoga and also rise to a very high state,

04:16.200 --> 04:18.750
even then their attention

04:19.070 --> 04:24.300
never stabilizes on Paramatma, Atma, or Kundalini

04:24.300 --> 04:30.920
and it  repeatedly goes towards wrong things.

04:32.220 --> 04:36.820
You had asked me, “What is to be done after getting realization”.

04:36.950 --> 04:40.570
After receiving (realisation)you have to give.

04:40.570 --> 04:44.320
It is absolutely necessary to give after receiving your realisation, otherwise receiving (it) has no meaning.

04:46.420 --> 04:51.320
And while giving, one point – only one small point, must be kept in mind,

04:51.320 --> 04:57.870
“That with this body, this mind (manas), this intellect (buddhi),—that means the ‘whole personality’

04:58.100 --> 05:04.170
with which you are giving such an incomparable thing, that itself should be very beautiful;

05:04.770 --> 05:07.320
your being should be very clean.”

05:07.714 --> 05:13.770
There should be no disease in it. If you have any sickness – perhaps there may be many Sahaja yogis having diseases.

05:13.850 --> 05:24.170
Before coming to Sahaja Yoga you must be getting worried and wishing that the disease should be somehow cured.

05:25.670 --> 05:32.650
But thereafter the attention does not go onto your sickness and you start saying, “It will be alright, does not matter.”

05:32.670 --> 05:36.300
But it is wrong Whatever may be your problem, even minor,

05:36.900 --> 05:43.560
you can cure yourself by placing your hand on that spot, you can keep your physical side very clean.

05:43.600 --> 05:49.520
There is not much to be done. Just meditate and keep yourself clean, keep your physical side clean.

05:49.650 --> 05:55.050
However, for you I have told you one important thing.

05:55.050 --> 06:02.670
As it is said, everyone must go to bathroom and clean oneself after getting up in the morning.

06:02.870 --> 06:09.750
. Similarly, for Sahaja Yogis, it is extremely important to do foot-soaking for at least five minutes, before going to bed.

06:09.900 --> 06:13.560
However highly evolved you may be and even if you may not be getting caught – but it does not matter.

06:13.560 --> 06:16.560
You must do foot-soaking for at least five minutes. Even I do foot-soaking sometimes,

06:16.560 --> 06:19.240
(although it is not necessary for me) so that my Sahaja Yogis will imbibe this habit. It is a very good habit.

06:19.650 --> 06:24.260
All Sahaja Yogis must do foot-soaking for at least for five minutes,daily. All Sahaja Yogis,

06:24.440 --> 06:27.000
should light a deep(lamp) before the photograph,

06:27.220 --> 06:31.900
apply sindur (vermilion), dip their feet in water

06:32.120 --> 06:35.020
and sit in this fashion opening out both the palms towards the photograph.

06:35.420 --> 06:39.420
If you do this, more than half of your problems would be solved automatically.

06:40.050 --> 06:43.720
Whatever happens, it is not difficult to spare five minutes.

06:44.070 --> 06:48.350
All should sit like this before going to sleep.

06:49.450 --> 06:55.900
That will stop more than half of your catches.

06:57.070 --> 07:00.670
We must get up early in the morning.

07:00.670 --> 07:04.220
Our sahaja yoga is a day time activity, not of night.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.400
So one must sleep early at night.

07:06.400 --> 07:13.650
I am not asking you to sleep at 6 pm but by 10 pm all must go to sleep.

07:14.170 --> 07:17.970
You should not stay awake after 10. You must get up early in the morning.

07:17.970 --> 07:24.020
In the morning after getting up early & taking your bath, one must sit for meditation.

07:24.750 --> 07:27.150
In the morning one must sit for meditation.

07:27.150 --> 07:33.070
Like, in our country, we have been getting up early in the morning

07:33.070 --> 07:38.200
and washing up our selves since ages and have been doing it all our lives.

07:38.200 --> 07:43.320
In the same way all sahaja yogis must get up early and meditate in the morning.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.770
It is a question forming a habit.

07:45.770 --> 07:51.000
But I have seen that for many it is very difficult to get up early at 4am or 5am.

07:51.320 --> 07:57.770
There is reason for that. I have done in-depth study about human beings. It is very joyful to study them.

07:57.900 --> 08:00.600
It is very interesting to see how human beings runs way from himself and argues against himself.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.880
It is quite interesting to see how he gives explanation about himself and makes himself an object of mockery.

08:03.020 --> 08:07.800
Some people tell me, Mother we cannot get u early in the morning.

08:07.800 --> 08:12.250
I say when did you go to sleep last night. 12 ‘O clock. But I had decided Mother, that I shall get up at 4 ‘O clock.

08:12.500 --> 08:16.550
That is impossible. But you must sleep early one day and must get up early next morning.

08:16.770 --> 08:20.550
Then you shall fall asleep early that day.

08:21.300 --> 08:28.450
You do that for 2 or 3 days and your body shall get accustomed to it.

08:34.200 --> 08:40.150
When you get up early in the morning, your receptivity is more.

08:40.400 --> 08:48.050
Not only that, at that early hour in the world also extremely beautiful (vibrations?)

08:55.070 --> 08:58.380
So from the point of view of body I have told you and also that one must meditate in the morning.

08:58.380 --> 09:02.080
Now how to meditate. Think about it, how to meditate early in the morning.

09:14.900 --> 09:29.920
First bow down yourself in your heart. Humble down yourself.

09:30.700 --> 09:38.620
If someone thinks that he has achieved a lot or „I am a very big saint”,

09:39.800 --> 09:43.350
then take it for granted that he is a gone case. He is about to go out of sahaja yoga.

09:43.700 --> 09:50.700
One should take permission and sit peacefully before the photograph with palms spread out

09:50.750 --> 09:53.620
and with extreme humbleness one must bow towards one’s heart.

09:53.950 --> 09:57.020
One has to ask for forgiveness repeatedly.

09:57.820 --> 10:01.320
So even at that time one must ask for forgiveness that

10:01.850 --> 10:08.800
„O God if have committed any mistake against yourself, please forgive us and take us into meditation".

10:08.850 --> 10:10.840
Then we pray, we forgive all those who have done any harm to us and if we had harmed anyone

10:10.840 --> 10:15.310
then please forgive us ‘O Lord. At this point bring pure emotions in your heart and then go into meditation. Now meditate with your eyes closed.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.080
Now one should not ask for how many minutes.

10:18.190 --> 10:20.020
It is very wrong to ask such questions.

10:20.400 --> 10:24.850
Whether you meditate for 5 minutes or 10 minutes. For five or ten minutes one must meditate with complete oneness of attention.

11:08.650 --> 11:18.950
umbly bow down yourself and meditate. But before meditation, one must understand it very carefully,

11:18.950 --> 11:24.150
before meditating give bandhan to the place where you are going to sit for meditation.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.300
Give yourself a bandhan,

11:36.350 --> 11:39.170
give your body a bandhan, 7 times give your body a bandhan,

11:39.170 --> 11:41.400
give that place a bandhan, give bandhan to photograph.

11:41.400 --> 11:48.170
This is not be done in a mechanical way like many people do

11:48.620 --> 11:58.720
but with humility and shraddha one must give bandhan as if one is doing a puja.

11:59.370 --> 12:04.570
Do not do exactly like a Puja: ofering, etc.

12:05.770 --> 12:09.700
After that give your ‘Mana’ a bandhan.

12:10.300 --> 12:12.250
Now where is ‘Mana’.

12:12.250 --> 12:21.850
You have never asked me, Mother where is ‘mana’.

12:23.700 --> 12:32.060
Mana is here. It starts from here. Meaning you must give forceful bandhan to vishuddhi and agnya chakra. Mana has to be given a bandhan.

12:33.070 --> 12:44.000
While giving bandhan one must have this thought that O Lord, let us remain in your bandhan and nothing untoward may happen to us.

12:44.500 --> 12:49.200
Bow down with extreme humility. At that time, just assume that you are in witness state

12:49.600 --> 12:53.700
and detached from everything.

12:55.470 --> 12:58.770
Just make yourself detached from everything and meditate.

12:59.070 --> 13:02.400
If you try this daily, it will become a habit.

13:03.200 --> 13:07.820
With extreme shradhha one must meditate early in the morning,

13:08.150 --> 13:14.720
may be for ten minutes or half an hour, it does not matter.

13:15.470 --> 13:19.600
While meditating do not move your hands.

13:32.770 --> 13:38.250
Just watch the photograph and slowly close your eyes

13:38.600 --> 13:41.570
while meditating and do not move your hands.

13:41.700 --> 13:44.520
At that time whichever chakra is having imbalance,

13:44.950 --> 13:50.700
it can be corrected by just watching that chakra

13:50.700 --> 13:54.520
because as I have said, Divine vibrations are more in the morning.

13:55.920 --> 14:00.750
Now after having purified our chakras,

14:00.750 --> 14:03.750
meditate on your Atma-tatva.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.750
Take your attention to your Atma(Spirit).

14:05.750 --> 14:14.150
Nobody has ever asked me,Mother where is Atma(The Spirit).

14:15.020 --> 14:21.720
Atma is in our heart but its seat is on our sahasrara.

14:24.570 --> 14:27.900
That is why I had said that bow down to your heart

14:27.900 --> 14:36.570
and take your attention to your sahasrara and be surrendered to Atma.

14:37.900 --> 14:40.420
With thought be surrendered towards the spirit. What is the essence of Atma-tatva.

14:40.800 --> 14:49.200
Atma-tatva is purity.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.520
One should say, complete Nirmal purity.

14:57.020 --> 14:59.950
Take your attention towards that.

15:01.500 --> 15:07.270
That is completely detached. It is not attached with anything.

15:08.450 --> 15:13.800
Due to your identifications(attachments), you are away from your spirit.

15:14.470 --> 15:17.420
Meditate on Atma-tatva. And this Atma-tatva is Love.

15:17.920 --> 15:22.050
Meditate on this.

15:22.700 --> 15:30.350
It is very Great – Atma Tatva is Love.

15:31.220 --> 15:40.150
Many religions have established in this world, but nobody has been able to describe Love in any of those religions.

15:41.450 --> 15:46.450
Love cannot be described but Love is that power that is flowing from your hands.

15:47.070 --> 15:54.970
This is the ‘Chetna’ awareness that people know as awareness.

15:55.620 --> 15:58.370
But they do not know that this is Love.

16:07.520 --> 16:11.320
They comprehend awareness as any other power like electricity.

16:11.320 --> 16:13.770
But no. Atma-tatva is Love.

16:14.020 --> 16:16.820
By saying one word, LOVE,

16:17.050 --> 16:20.500
you are librated from many bandhans(bondages).

16:21.750 --> 16:27.700
Whatever is false, untruth is against Love.

16:28.670 --> 16:36.820
Even if you are scolding someone and telling them about Truth, you are loving him.

16:39.270 --> 16:42.170
You yourself have become Love(Prem),

16:42.650 --> 16:46.170
that’s why by just meditating on Prem-Tatva

16:46.320 --> 16:49.750
you can get into Atma-tatva.

16:57.020 --> 17:02.450
While meditating do not get stuck into any one thought.

17:03.070 --> 17:08.750
I am that Atma-tatva.

17:09.100 --> 17:15.820
I am that power of God Almighty.

17:16.920 --> 17:19.520
You can say like that.

17:19.900 --> 17:24.500
This way, by just saying 2-3 times you shall feel blessed. Because you are saying the Truth,

17:24.700 --> 17:31.370
vibrations start flowing from your being with great force.

17:34.050 --> 17:37.670
Now what should be done in day to day life.

17:38.570 --> 17:41.600
In your daily life, you must know

17:42.120 --> 17:47.650
that the power within you is of Prem-tatva (Principiul Dragostei).

17:48.820 --> 17:52.150
Whatever you do,

17:52.400 --> 17:55.970
are you doing it in love or you are just trying to show off that you are a great sahaja yogi.

17:56.120 --> 17:59.370
If I say something to anybody or if I get angry with someone

17:59.670 --> 18:04.650
then i notice that they he speaks against Me to other sahaja yogis and then he asks me

18:05.320 --> 18:09.550
„why have I lost my vibrations.”

18:11.550 --> 18:17.850
If you are indulging in such foolishness then it is better that you leave sahaja yoga.

18:17.970 --> 18:23.020
Only those who are desirous of taking something can stay in sahaja yoga.

18:23.420 --> 18:27.520
He has no right to give Me anything, he only has to accept it from Me.

18:27.520 --> 18:31.220
If he wants to give then when his powers are developed

18:31.470 --> 18:33.800
then it would be very good.

18:33.970 --> 18:38.020
But you can give only when you are able to absorb.

18:38.750 --> 18:43.150
Therefore first learn to absorb.

18:43.400 --> 18:48.170
Try to see your shortcomings.

18:48.450 --> 18:50.200
For our benevolence we should see what we want to give.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.050
We are giving love.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.070
Are we standing in Love?

18:57.170 --> 18:59.100
We fight with everyone,

18:59.200 --> 19:00.750
we argue with everyone, we trouble others

19:00.800 --> 19:02.350
and we think we are sahaja yogis.

19:02.550 --> 19:04.650
We should not live with this falsehood.

19:04.870 --> 19:11.150
We should live with ourselves like a mirror

19:11.500 --> 19:14.120
meaning we should watch ourselves all the time.

19:14.250 --> 19:16.520
Like if something is sticking on to my face and you inform me about that

19:16.520 --> 19:19.720
and I can wipe it.

19:19.820 --> 19:22.170
In the same way you should watch yourself

19:22.170 --> 19:27.170
and wipe off anything that is sticking to you.

19:29.020 --> 19:33.120
In your day to day life, you should live a brighter life.

19:33.370 --> 19:35.620
There should be transformation in your face.

19:35.900 --> 19:44.670
Your behaviour has to be beautiful. Love should flow from you. If you are an individual without love

19:45.850 --> 19:49.300
then you are not a sahaja yogi.

19:49.300 --> 19:51.000
You should know this.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.900
You have become a sahaja yogi without any desire for it and without proving your worth and I am tolerating you and you are sitting here today.

19:55.900 --> 20:03.150
If you cannot improve then please forgive me and stop coming to sahaja yoga.

20:03.820 --> 20:06.240
Such people will themselves go out of sahaja yoga in a few days time.

20:06.420 --> 20:14.420
şThose who are devoid of love, those who think they are highly evolved, are useless for sahaja yoga.

20:15.200 --> 20:21.070
Such people should go to other ku-gurus(Fake gurus) and get kicked by them and feel the heat.

20:21.770 --> 20:27.450
Here in sahaja yoga you have come to become instrument of God Almighty.

20:27.620 --> 20:33.070
You should be extremely humble, extremely humble.

20:33.470 --> 20:37.700
You should give up ego completely. Others say one has to take sanyaas(renunciation),

20:38.000 --> 20:42.700
I say first give up your ego. Give up your anger.

20:42.800 --> 20:47.200
By taking out your clothes you have not renounced anything.

20:47.350 --> 20:52.470
Renunciation means giving up anger,lust,attachment,pride greed, jealousy etc.

20:52.470 --> 20:58.700
giving up these shadripus(the six enemies) is called sanyaas – sanyast. We are not talking about superficial renunciation.

21:00.550 --> 21:12.070
You should be extremely loving and peaceful while dealing with others.

21:12.470 --> 21:17.100
You should be talking about sahaja yoga with your family,children and friends.

21:17.420 --> 21:21.120
Change your friends and acquaintances.

21:21.300 --> 21:24.870
They(sahaja yogis) are your real relations.

21:25.020 --> 21:32.650
You should talk to them. They(sahaja yogis) will tell you that we have entered into a new world,

21:33.850 --> 21:39.400
we have new vibratory awareness.

21:40.300 --> 21:44.220
Whenever you travel anywhere ,

21:44.520 --> 21:50.950
like someone was telling me he has come from Rahuri,

21:51.100 --> 21:55.900
that just as we carry our personal items while travelling, we also carry ‘teertha’,

21:55.900 --> 21:59.720
the water vibrated by my feet is called ‘teertha’, and other vibrated items like kum kum etc.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.570
If we find any sick person on the way, we give him ‘teertha’ to drink.

22:03.750 --> 22:07.450
If someone talks about religion we show him Mother’s photograph and tell him about Mother

22:07.450 --> 22:10.320
and that she can give you your self realisation.

22:10.920 --> 22:14.970
They apply kum kum to some and ask them how do they feel,

22:15.200 --> 22:20.150
show them my photo and talk about me and tell them that they can get their realisation from this photograph.

22:20.150 --> 22:25.800
All the time they only talk of sahaja yoga and only think how they can manifest sahaja yoga.

22:25.950 --> 22:28.030
By doing this you shall find your depth.

22:28.570 --> 22:33.820
There are also some people who come to sahaja yoga like they visit a temple

22:35.300 --> 22:38.420
and then they are gone in no time. Due to this they face adverse results.

22:38.420 --> 22:43.920
You will people sitting here, who used to be very sick earlier

22:43.920 --> 22:48.670
but ever since they have received their realisation they have never fallen ill.

22:48.770 --> 22:53.020
They have never visited a doctor after their realisation.

22:54.250 --> 23:00.950
They have never taken any medicine either

23:01.500 --> 23:08.070
and there are some old people too, who always used to visit doctors, hospitals and have stopped doing so ever since taking to sahaja yoga.

23:08.070 --> 23:13.600
There are many such examples.

23:13.850 --> 23:17.350
Not only this but they have also helped others.

23:17.350 --> 23:24.150
The reason is that whatever is required to be done as a sahaja yogi for one’s health they kept on doing that and got cured.

23:24.670 --> 23:29.370
You should all meet each other. Among yourself you are all doctors and all are patients.

23:29.900 --> 23:34.400
Just as doctors do not take fees from one another. In the same way, you also do not take any fees from each other when you help one another.

23:34.770 --> 23:39.660
You should treat other and discuss among yourself and you should not mind.

23:39.660 --> 23:43.960
If someone tells you that your sahasrara is caught up then it is a matter of shame

23:44.120 --> 23:48.000
because getting at sahasrara means being against Me.

23:48.370 --> 23:52.770
Then you ask others to correct yourself and wonder how you got caught.

23:52.770 --> 23:55.720
You should never have anything to do with any person who is against sahaja yoga.

23:55.720 --> 23:57.400
If you do that then your sahasrara is caught up.

23:57.620 --> 24:02.350
Do not talk to him and advise him not to talk to you.

24:02.350 --> 24:06.270
Do not talk to him and advise him not to talk to you.

24:06.550 --> 24:10.150
Tell him that you are meeting him due to Mother and that he should keep quite.

24:10.720 --> 24:13.350
If you keep talking to such a person

24:13.350 --> 24:19.320
then your sahasrara is caught up and after a few days you will come to me and say, Mother I have got cancer.

24:19.750 --> 24:25.770
One or two persons had it but now they are cured.

24:26.900 --> 24:32.750
You must know that cancer is a disease of the sahasrara.

24:33.270 --> 24:40.670
If you have to be free from cancer then keep your sahasrara pure.

24:40.820 --> 24:45.680
If your sahasrara starts getting caught up then know that it is the beginning of cancer.

24:45.680 --> 24:48.030
You should always keep your sahasrara clean because

24:48.030 --> 24:51.480
if you do not do so then after a few years you will come and say that you have developed cancer.

24:51.770 --> 24:58.800
Then why not keep yourself clean from now. Not only that why not work for sahaja yoga

24:58.950 --> 25:02.750
for which we are in the kingdom of God.

25:03.170 --> 25:06.540
Tomorrow when such people are chosen from this world

25:06.540 --> 25:11.400
who belong to God’s kingdom then you shall be the chosen ones.

25:11.800 --> 25:15.650
Why not do such acts. We are just wasting our time,

25:15.650 --> 25:20.200
meeting friends, having food with relations, criticizing others.

25:20.200 --> 25:23.770
Let’s leave all that and improve our ways.

25:24.300 --> 25:28.370
We should lead such a life that we are remembered for that.

25:29.020 --> 25:30.300
Lets think like that.

25:30.300 --> 25:36.070
Nobody should think that he is left with very few years in life and it is difficult to achieve it now.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.920
You shall not die.

25:38.920 --> 25:42.700
When you die you are then reborn and this goes on.

25:42.700 --> 25:48.800
The why not come out of this cycle(of births and deaths)

25:48.800 --> 25:53.670
in a year’s time and if you wish you can do that in a week’s time.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.600
You only have to decide once, just once.

25:56.850 --> 26:05.000
You can be immensely benefitted by sahaja yoga just by deciding once like this.

26:06.080 --> 26:06.900
You should be surrendered completely.

26:07.060 --> 26:09.680
It is not necessary that you touch my feet but should be surrendered to me from your heart.

26:09.840 --> 26:14.440
Some people touch my feet but are not surrendered in their heart.

26:16.620 --> 26:20.220
One has to be completely surrendered to Me from within.

26:20.770 --> 26:29.620
If you are completely surrendered from within then your kundalini remains established on your Atma-Tatva,

26:31.200 --> 26:38.750
just like the flame of a lamp, without any flickering.

26:39.550 --> 26:42.700
But one must remain surrendered for that.

26:44.170 --> 26:53.070
In the surrendered state one experiences Joy, Bliss and God realisation.

26:56.150 --> 27:09.320
Sahaja Yoga is a unparalleled, unique & special thing. Please try to understand this and be involved in it.

27:10.750 --> 27:21.170
The more you identify yourself with Tadatma(oneness with the Divine) state, the more your Atma-tatva shines.

27:23.350 --> 27:30.800
Nothing is important at all, except that you yourself become the Light.

27:32.420 --> 27:40.970
Those who are indulging in nonsense activities all the time are suggested to leave such things.

27:42.500 --> 27:50.190
Those things are not for them. I am telling you one last time.

27:50.430 --> 27:55.360
Please take note of it and act on it intelligently.

28:07.700 --> 28:15.070
Within us lie many evil tendencies, and within us lie many negativities.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.470
These influence us to do evil deeds.

28:18.850 --> 28:25.870
To act under their influence is like becoming Satana yourself.

28:26.070 --> 28:32.170
Now it is upto you to either become a Satan or become God.

28:34.200 --> 28:40.000
Now if you wish to become Satan then it is a different thing and I am not your Guru for that.

28:40.500 --> 28:43.450
But if you wish to become God then I am your Guru.

28:43.900 --> 28:46.600
But you should save yourself from becoming Satan.

28:46.920 --> 28:53.400
First thing to note is that on the night of new-moon and full-moon,

28:53.650 --> 28:58.020
always there are dangers on your left and right sides.

28:58.520 --> 29:07.720
Specially on these two days, that is, the nights of new moon and full moon, you should sleep very early at night.

29:09.020 --> 29:15.000
After singing bhajans, bow down before the photograph, meditate,

29:15.000 --> 29:19.720
and keep your  attention on Sahasrara and go to sleep after taking bandhan.

29:20.370 --> 29:24.300
That means you go into the unconscious the moment your attention is at your Sahasrara.

29:24.300 --> 29:27.650
There, give yourself a bandhan and you are saved.

29:28.420 --> 29:31.620
During these two nights it should be observed particularly.

29:32.600 --> 29:39.350
The night of new moon, you should meditate especially on Shri Shiva.

29:39.720 --> 29:46.450
You should sleep after meditating on Shri Shiva

29:46.820 --> 29:53.200
– that is the Spirit – and completely surrender yourself to Him.

29:54.720 --> 29:56.860
On the night of full moon, you should meditate on Shri Rama and surrender yourself to Him for protection.

30:00.270 --> 30:06.720
The meaning of the word Ramchandra is  “creativity”.

30:07.320 --> 30:12.620
You should completely dedicate your creative powers to Him.

30:12.620 --> 30:15.850
Thus you have to take special care of yourself on these two days.

30:16.470 --> 30:26.300
However on the seventh and ninth days of Lunar fortnights (according to the Indian Calendar “saptami” and “navami”)

30:26.700 --> 30:28.170
you have my special blessings.

30:28.170 --> 30:37.170
Remember that you are specially blessed by Me  on these two days.

30:37.170 --> 30:40.950
Make some special arrangements so that you can have proper meditation on these days.

32:07.520 --> 32:16.820
You must do collective meditation only at those places which have been purified by my Feet(where I have physically visited).

32:17.020 --> 32:24.540
You should not be doing collective meditation at your home by inviting someone.

32:24.540 --> 32:35.000
Even with your relations also you should not be doing collective meditation.

32:35.250 --> 32:39.620
You should be doing collective meditation only wherever I have told you to do so.

32:40.200 --> 32:49.700
You should also be discussing about sahaja yoga for a very long time at such a place where I have not put My Feet.

32:50.100 --> 32:56.770
Because at such places, bhoots shall start talking thru yourself and you shall start fighting among your self.

32:57.240 --> 32:59.710
I am saying this because even now you are not free from the clutches of Bhoots.

32:59.710 --> 33:02.250
You are not able to know when the bhoot enters into your being and takes over.

33:02.500 --> 33:05.120
This is how you should protect yourself. And whenever you are going out, leaving your home, give yourself a bandhan; always be in the bandhan.

33:05.120 --> 33:09.570
If you come across someone having a catch on Agnya, give him a bandhan, even with your attention it can be done.

33:09.570 --> 33:13.520
Never argue with a person who’s caught on Agnya; it is a foolishness to do so.

33:14.020 --> 33:18.650
Can you ever argue with a person who is caught on Agnya, who is a bhoot ?

33:19.150 --> 33:24.100
Do not argue with a person who is caught on Agnya. ‘Never’. Just agree with him for whatever he says.

33:24.100 --> 33:27.220
Go on saying yes,yes, you are right.

33:27.750 --> 33:33.020
Because whenever we have a mentally challenged person we only say yes, yes whatever you are saying it right.

33:33.950 --> 33:37.970
Never argue with a person who is caught on agnya.

33:37.970 --> 33:42.370
You should also not be arguing with a person who is caught on vishuddhi.

33:43.270 --> 33:47.050
And never go near a  person who is caught on Sahasrara!

33:47.050 --> 33:51.100
Have no contact with him. Tell him to improve his Sahasrara first.

33:51.350 --> 33:55.270
You should not be hesitant in telling him, “Your Sahasrara is caught. Put it right.”

33:56.120 --> 33:59.000
Sahasrara should be kept clean.

33:59.370 --> 34:04.870
If anyone has started catching on Sahasrara, then he should immediately take help from other Sahaja Yogis,

34:05.720 --> 34:10.300
“Do something and clear my Sahasrara”. If someone who is caught on Sahasrara talks to you, you should tell him, ‘you are my enemy’.

34:10.300 --> 34:15.000
Never talk to him as long as he is caught on sahasrara.

34:17.920 --> 34:24.300
As regards a person caught on Heart, you should help that person, as far as possible.

34:24.470 --> 34:29.370
Put bandhan on his heart, put your hand on your heart

34:29.500 --> 34:34.170
and take him to the photograph of Shri Mataji. You must take care of heart chakra.

34:34.500 --> 34:38.270
May be, sometimes one may get a problem on the heart chakra.

34:39.370 --> 34:41.970
You must help others clear the heart chakra.

34:42.200 --> 34:46.570
But many people have no heart ! They are very dry personalities.

34:47.020 --> 34:52.500
And you cannot do anything for such dry persons, even if you wish to.

34:53.620 --> 34:58.320
So you should leave them alone. However, if they come to you and ask for your help then advise them to first leave Hatha Yoga,

34:58.470 --> 35:05.070
and then ask them to leave other unimportant things in life. They should be asked to learn to love others

35:05.070 --> 35:10.670
and if they cannot love human beings then they should at least start loving dogs,cats.

35:11.200 --> 35:18.050
Love everyone. Love children. Never aggress on to children. In fact one should never aggress on anyone.

35:18.550 --> 35:21.220
Never hurt anyone.

35:21.750 --> 35:25.270
Nobody should beat the children. No sahaja yogi should ever beat your children with your hands.

35:25.270 --> 35:27.400
Never beat others with your hands, never.  Never get angry with anyone.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.810
Particularly, Sahaja Yogis should never get angry. Without getting annoyed, they should improve everything tactfully and intelligently.

35:30.970 --> 35:32.750
Never get angry.

35:32.970 --> 35:39.650
You must pray for, How should the day to day life of a sahaja yogi be. One should think about it.

35:40.200 --> 35:49.250
I have told you in many ways. Similarly this organisation that we have of ‘Anant Jeevan’(Eternal Life),

35:50.570 --> 35:58.190
for which eight to ten people should come together and think what is to be done.

35:58.190 --> 36:06.270
You must all contribute to it and should give their services for it.

36:06.600 --> 36:14.120
All those who still haven’t given their names should give them to Mr Pradhan,

36:14.420 --> 36:23.570
and we are going to start a quarterly publication in which all my letters, messages, lectures will be printed

36:23.700 --> 36:28.920
and apart from that if you have any experiences to be shared then do it so that these can also be printed in it.

36:29.270 --> 36:34.350
Whatever experiences we get from all over India, some of them would be printed in that.

36:34.350 --> 36:39.000
Therefore if you have any experiences keep writing to them.

36:39.000 --> 36:44.340
Apart from that if you can write an article on sahaja yoga please write and send it for printing.

36:44.620 --> 36:50.970
This way there shall be a quarterly in which there will be some articles in Hindi,

36:51.340 --> 36:58.760
some in Marathi, some in English, and some in Gujarati.

36:59.100 --> 37:03.350
So we shall be starting printing either together in all these languages or one by one.

37:03.350 --> 37:05.390
Everything happens slowly in sahaja yoga.

37:05.390 --> 37:08.890
For that you must contribute, give your subscription and take advantage out of it.

37:08.970 --> 37:12.860
If you have any questions

37:12.860 --> 37:15.870
on this then raise them and I shall answer all of them together.

37:16.070 --> 37:22.220
We are first starting a quarterly which later be a monthly and then weekly and finally daily,

37:22.220 --> 37:25.950
but for now it shall be a quarterly publication.

37:26.620 --> 37:30.050
If you have questions, any problems

37:30.050 --> 37:33.370
then please send a letter in my name to Mr Pradhan.

37:33.370 --> 37:36.850
Please don’t write many letters to me as I do not have time.

37:36.850 --> 37:41.100
After that do not say Mother has written to him and not to me.

37:41.100 --> 37:47.350
Do not talk in such foolish ways. Sahaja Yoga is not for such people.

37:47.450 --> 37:50.270
You know that your Mother loves you all equally.

37:50.600 --> 37:53.850
For some reasons I may not write to some people.

37:54.150 --> 37:55.500
Sometimes She writes to you and sometimes not.

37:55.500 --> 37:58.320
Sometimes I write to those whom I know will never mind if I don’t write to them.

37:58.420 --> 38:02.800
And now I am not going to care about those who feel bad if I don’t write to them.

38:02.970 --> 38:08.470
I have cared enough for such people and the result is that those evil people

38:08.870 --> 38:14.500
have remained that way and never improved and we have been troubled.

38:14.620 --> 38:18.300
All those with whom I have been patient thinking that one they shall improve have not shown any progress

38:18.300 --> 38:22.600
and have remained wicked, they have not transformed even wee bit and we have got the pain.

38:22.820 --> 38:28.600
Because I had decided that no human being shall be destroyed in this kaliyuga.

38:28.600 --> 38:32.900
I shall not torture any human being. I have given him complete freedom to go either to hell or towards God.

38:33.300 --> 38:35.200
I have given you complete freedom.

38:35.200 --> 38:39.690
If someone wants to go to hell then I say take faster steps towards it,

38:39.930 --> 38:42.080
so that I am free from you.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.300
That arrangement also I have done.

38:44.450 --> 38:47.300
If you wish to go to hell then I have made arrangements for that also

38:47.570 --> 38:51.920
but if you wish to go at the Feet of God, that also is arranged for you.

38:51.920 --> 38:56.800
So I am telling all those who have troubled me, disturbed me

38:57.000 --> 39:01.450
or tormented me that I have had enough patience

39:01.450 --> 39:06.100
and now if anyone troubles me or disturbs me then I have to say very clearly to such persons

39:06.100 --> 39:08.270
that now we have no relation with you and that you should leave sahaja yoga.

39:08.420 --> 39:13.320
Such elements, while going out of sahaja yoga show their true colors and disturb us again.

39:13.320 --> 39:19.000
Their true nature is exposed. But I have to tell you that you think about your well being.

39:19.220 --> 39:23.420
There is no need to follow them and go to hell.

39:23.420 --> 39:28.700
Think about your own well being. There is no need to argue with anyone.

39:30.370 --> 39:32.500
They shall remain as they were earlier.

39:32.500 --> 39:36.270
They are very difficult to get transformed.

39:36.270 --> 39:37.520
Because they are evil.

39:37.520 --> 39:41.300
Those who are good, they may initially behave like them but get transformed very easily.

39:41.670 --> 39:43.500
Those who are evil are impossible to get transformed

39:43.700 --> 39:47.670
and I have understood this. I have tried enough but such people shall remain as they were.

39:47.670 --> 39:49.670
You can never transform them.

39:49.670 --> 39:52.650
They shall never have wisdom.

39:52.650 --> 39:55.900
That’s why there is no need to argue with such people.

39:56.100 --> 39:59.170
I have to request you,

39:59.170 --> 40:03.300
not to have any kind of relationship with such people.

40:03.650 --> 40:05.420
Slowly they shall be out of sahaja yoga.

40:05.420 --> 40:11.500
They are here because they want to destroy whatever you have accomplished.

40:11.960 --> 40:15.920
You should save yourself from such people. Get your vibrations.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.850
There was a person who wanted to give us a house.

40:18.850 --> 40:21.100
This gentleman came to me and took Realization.

40:21.100 --> 40:25.000
But after Realization, he got someone.

40:25.000 --> 40:29.920
The visitor said that in Shri Mataji group are just delinquents.

40:30.300 --> 40:33.820
He received his Realization, he felt vibrations and despite this, believed the visitor.

40:34.370 --> 40:39.600
He said then: "I can not give you my house because some things were said ..."

40:40.020 --> 40:43.770
I replied: "All right, give this gentleman the house" Poor fellow!

40:43.770 --> 40:48.520
Nobody wants to buy the house now and he loses, called me daily: "Please buy my house. I'm sorry, forgive me."

40:48.720 --> 40:52.650
I repeated: "Did you than to sell this gentleman the house. You are free to do so. "

40:53.320 --> 40:57.070
Now he complains, complains: "Shri Mataji's mad at me."

40:57.070 --> 41:01.850
I'm not mad at all, I said: "Sell your house person who told you all these things."

41:02.170 --> 41:06.350
So all those who think they are very intelligent, if they want to go to hell

41:06.350 --> 41:11.050
I can issue them ticket to hell. It is all under my control.

41:11.350 --> 41:15.550
All those desirous of going to hell can have the ticket from me and I am willing to give it.

41:15.800 --> 41:19.800
Those who want to go the kingdom of God their ticket also I can issue.

41:19.970 --> 41:24.170
A ticket clerk can issue ticket for any destination

41:24.370 --> 41:32.920
but ticket clerk will inform you that if you go this way there will be derailment

41:32.920 --> 41:35.070
and immediately on reaching there your  .... will break,

41:35.320 --> 41:40.400
there is no return from there, you cannot come back from there. Return ticket is not available from there.

41:40.970 --> 41:47.050
That’s why I am informing you but I do not have to say much about hell, as you know all about it.

41:47.370 --> 41:52.650
I have told you all this so that you can keep your own instrument clean.

41:52.650 --> 41:56.000
And always keep your sight on higher level. You should not keep your sight low but on higher level.

41:56.000 --> 42:00.070
You have to rise higher. Never look down. You have to rise higher.

42:00.300 --> 42:03.950
I am with you at every step, at every place. Everywhere.

42:03.950 --> 42:08.120
Wherever You are, at whichever  place you are, I am with you, completely, in person,

42:08.520 --> 42:09.920
by my spirit and by my word completely.

42:10.160 --> 42:12.170
This is my promise to you.

42:12.170 --> 42:16.200
But those who wish to go to Hell, they will also be sucked down.

42:16.270 --> 42:20.320
That is also arranged.

42:20.320 --> 42:24.700
Therefore be careful. Take to higher life.

42:31.220 --> 42:32.970
Now I am going to London

42:32.970 --> 42:39.100
and when I come back I want to see that each one of you should have given realisation to at least ten persons.

42:39.270 --> 42:42.900
Call others, talk to them about sahaja yoga openly. Don’t feel shy.

42:42.900 --> 42:44.600
Tell them about sahaja yoga

42:44.600 --> 42:48.500
how truthful it is. It is the religion of Truth. It is for real.

42:48.500 --> 42:50.370
Gather people,

42:50.550 --> 42:54.650
talk to them wherever you find them.

42:54.650 --> 42:58.880
Everyone of you should take the photograph and each one should give photo in ten homes.

42:58.880 --> 43:03.660
It is a very good way that each person contributes to take ten photographs.

43:03.900 --> 43:08.640
Give these photos to ten such homes where there will be respect towards the photo,

43:08.640 --> 43:12.880
where it will be worshipped and where sahaja yoga can be accepted.

43:13.150 --> 43:16.720
By this way only we can spread sahaja yoga.

43:16.720 --> 43:19.300
We do not want to have much publicity because

43:19.300 --> 43:22.780
whenever we do publicity then dirty people are also attracted and the good people do not come.

43:22.850 --> 43:32.970
Therefore it is better to serve sahaja yoga all the time

43:33.100 --> 43:36.600
and make yourself wealthy(spiritually) by it.

43:36.970 --> 43:39.550
May God Bless you.

43:39.670 --> 43:44.970
My complete blessings are with you. My heart, mind,

43:45.200 --> 43:48.270
body be always engaged in your service.

43:48.470 --> 43:50.900
I am not away from you even for a moment.

43:50.900 --> 43:54.520
Whenever you will remember me anywhere

43:54.520 --> 43:57.350
by just closing your eyes , at that moment I shall come to you with all my powers, ‘

43:57.350 --> 44:01.800
‘Shankh,Chakra, Gada, Padma Garud  layee siddhari’ ( Just as Lord Krishana came riding on his Condour from Dwarika, with all his Divine weapons – Shankh, Chakra, Gada, Padma when Draupadi called Him – I shall be before you in no time)

44:02.050 --> 44:04.320
Even for a moment I shall not be late

44:04.320 --> 44:06.270
ut you will have to be Mine.

44:06.450 --> 44:08.520
This is very important.

44:08.670 --> 44:13.150
If you are Mine then I shall not be late even for a moment.

44:13.720 --> 44:15.920
I shall be before you.

44:15.920 --> 44:20.870
Let God bless you all and give you wisdom.
