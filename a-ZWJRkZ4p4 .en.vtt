00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:13.371
So you believe in Sahaja Yoga,
you believe in Mother, you believe in everything

00:00:13.451 --> 00:00:17.239
but you do not feel from within yourself

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:21.980
that this is a part and parcel of your being.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.200
The reason is your superficial being is acting

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.004
and your genuine being is lost in the weight
with the weight of the ego.

00:00:32.084 --> 00:00:37.952
And the distance is so much that when
you do something in Sahaja Yoga also,

00:00:38.032 --> 00:00:40.715
it is not from your heart.

00:00:40.795 --> 00:00:44.291
And that’s why I have seen people,
 I ask them, “How are you?”

00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:46.828
and they will say, “I am still going up and down”.

00:00:46.908 --> 00:00:49.148
I said, “Still going up and down means what?”

00:00:49.228 --> 00:00:53.122
Because they don’t do it from their heart,
 because they have lost their heart.

00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:56.678
When you start playing games and when you say, “What’s wrong?”

00:00:56.758 --> 00:01:03.006
Immediately there is one blow comes into the
– one blow of air comes into the ego

00:01:03.086 --> 00:01:05.114
and then again you go away from yourself.

00:01:05.194 --> 00:01:08.887
Like that, you go and
separating and the whole thing is

00:01:08.967 --> 00:01:12.246
a very artificial being within you which acts

00:01:12.326 --> 00:01:15.911
and the genuine being within you is lost.

00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:19.801
So what you have to do is to pray through your heart.

00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:22.953
You have to say, “Mother, be in my heart”.

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:25.766
Do everything from your heart.

00:01:25.846 --> 00:01:31.039
If you start doing from your heart,
then this cloud of ego will disappear.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.836
So, try to do everything from your heart,
say mantras of the heart

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:41.943
and try to open your heart and don’t live on this artificial level.

00:01:42.117 --> 00:01:50.115
So, I would say that you must say the mantra of the heart saying that,

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:57.523
“Mother, be in my heart.” “Stay in my heart.”
“Let me love You from my heart.”

00:01:57.603 --> 00:02:03.999
When you look at the photograph,
put all your heart on the photograph.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.336
Take the photograph to your heart.

00:02:06.416 --> 00:02:12.306
If you start doing like this then only you will
reach that depth where your genuine being is.

00:02:12.386 --> 00:02:16.777
Otherwise, you are lost, you don’t know
why this thing is happening superficially.

00:02:16.857 --> 00:02:18.270
You can do it.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.835
The Spirit is the source of joy.
 I am the source of joy too.

00:02:25.915 --> 00:02:31.120
So, if you put Me in your heart,
then the source of joy is in your heart.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.083
The trouble is, you do not put Me in your heart.

00:02:34.163 --> 00:02:41.131
And you just want to see that I am there
and just to mentally feel that,

00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:43.598
“Oh Mother has come to my house”

00:02:43.678 --> 00:02:47.560
or “Oh I was with Mother, I can give Her flowers,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.285
or I can give Her fruits, or I can do for Her this”.

00:02:51.365 --> 00:02:54.886
This is all again mental satisfactions. Am I in your heart?

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:57.832
Or you are doing outside? It’s the point you should find out.

00:02:57.912 --> 00:03:00.392
If you put Me in your heart,

00:03:00.472 --> 00:03:04.178
then because I am the source
of peace, I am the source of joy,

00:03:04.258 --> 00:03:09.453
and I am the source of all the beautiful things that you could think of,

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:14.461
you will have them, because you have not
put Me in your heart, what can I do?

00:03:17.493 --> 00:03:20.253
You have to put Me in your heart.

00:03:20.293 --> 00:03:27.613
Now see how the cosmos of the whole
Sahaja Yoga system since long has been built in,

00:03:27.693 --> 00:03:29.213
in you.

00:03:30.413 --> 00:03:37.493
Heart is the most important part, from [which] everything circulates.

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:47.293
This heart is the one, when it fails, you are dead, no more there.

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:52.693
The Spirit resides in the heart, alright.

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:59.286
Now you are made like this even in your head
that the heart centre comes up exactly

00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:06.173
on the brahmarandhra, where it has to break.

00:04:08.024 --> 00:04:14.293
So, if your heart is weak, you cannot pierce through.

00:04:14.293 --> 00:04:23.000
So, putting Me in your heart and raising Me to your Sahastrara,

00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:27.441
that’s the best way you can cure your heart.

00:04:27.653 --> 00:04:30.373
But that’s not so!

00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:36.533
You also put some theological concepts on that.

00:04:36.613 --> 00:04:38.453
I’ve seen people do.

00:04:38.493 --> 00:04:45.453
So, “Mother, I put You in my heart,
I love You very much,” this, that, everything.

00:04:45.453 --> 00:04:48.693
But I see there’s not Mother there at all!

00:04:48.733 --> 00:04:50.613
Just lip service!

00:04:53.613 --> 00:04:56.693
“I’m putting You in my heart, of course you are there!”

00:04:56.733 --> 00:04:58.293
But where am I?

00:04:58.293 --> 00:05:02.733
I try to find. I can’t see Myself there.

00:05:03.293 --> 00:05:06.373
No, I am not there.

00:05:06.453 --> 00:05:08.293
So from where do I see you?

00:05:08.373 --> 00:05:10.293
Through your eyes.

00:05:11.573 --> 00:05:15.453
If I am there I can see through your eyes,

00:05:15.493 --> 00:05:17.293
I can penetrate up to that.

00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:22.293
Such eyes are very different.

00:05:23.066 --> 00:05:27.026
Your eyes have to change through your heart.

00:05:27.453 --> 00:05:30.413
There’s no deception in between.

00:05:31.026 --> 00:05:34.426
If your heart changes your eyes will change.

00:05:35.146 --> 00:05:36.586
You don’t have to tell Me.

00:05:37.026 --> 00:05:39.226
I know that.

00:05:41.765 --> 00:05:44.306
So this, “I love You,” Why?

00:05:44.346 --> 00:05:48.186
“Because I wanted to have a job,” finished!

00:05:49.386 --> 00:05:55.266
“I love You Mother, because I thought
my marriage problem will be solved."

00:05:57.546 --> 00:06:01.306
“I give You this, because I’ll get money!”

00:06:02.546 --> 00:06:08.386
“I pray for you, because I must have a child,”
or something like that.

00:06:08.466 --> 00:06:11.306
It’s so much below.

00:06:17.506 --> 00:06:22.346
But the state [you] must reach, where
“I just love You for nothing at all.

00:06:22.426 --> 00:06:24.546
Just love You because I enjoy it.

00:06:24.586 --> 00:06:29.186
I enjoy that love for my own enjoyment.

00:06:32.346 --> 00:06:35.346
Just for my own enjoyment I love You.

00:06:36.026 --> 00:06:40.386
Not even for the ascent or anything
but I just enjoy that love within myself.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.760
For nothing at all, just for myself I love You."

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:12.243
Sahaja Yogi: …I want to get deeper,
but I can’t. I don’t know how to make that happen.

00:07:13.116 --> 00:07:15.546
Shri Mataji: Now, sit down.

00:07:16.612 --> 00:07:22.013
Now, we have concepts, you see,
about our depth also.

00:07:22.093 --> 00:07:25.216
When we say, we want to go deeper, means what?

00:07:25.297 --> 00:07:27.223
Sahaja Yogi: Which leads to the joy.

00:07:27.304 --> 00:07:28.596
Shri Mataji: It’s the joy.

00:07:28.676 --> 00:07:32.851
Now, if you don’t feel the joy, then you should find out within yourself:

00:07:32.931 --> 00:07:36.308
have you put your Mother into your heart?

00:07:43.885 --> 00:07:46.260
More than anybody else.

00:07:46.847 --> 00:07:50.904
As the gurus ask a question as soon as you go to them:

00:07:50.984 --> 00:07:53.066
“Will you sacrifice your life for me?”

00:07:53.146 --> 00:07:57.093
Of course, I don’t want you to- but they ask a question:

00:07:57.173 --> 00:08:00.601
“Will you sacrifice your life for me?”

00:08:06.237 --> 00:08:10.049
It’s a little bit, you have to open out (your heart).

00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:17.085
Just put me in your heart. I’m at your service,
whenever you’ll say, I’ll sit there.

00:08:17.165 --> 00:08:22.113
If you want, you can put it
in your head or in your heart,

00:08:22.193 --> 00:08:25.948
anywhere you want me to go I’ll be there.

00:08:26.028 --> 00:08:28.967
But, better to be in the heart

00:08:31.301 --> 00:08:35.401
because, in the brain, I’m too much knowledge

00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:41.233
— maybe, it’s too much for you.

00:08:44.383 --> 00:08:50.611
But if your brain is too much then it’s better
you put me in the brain and the heart, both.

00:08:50.691 --> 00:08:57.949
If the liver is too much, then you can put me
 in your heart, brain and in your liver.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:04.074
I can become the minutest of a minute.
Can you believe that?

00:09:04.154 --> 00:09:07.041
How can I go into your heart?

00:09:08.201 --> 00:09:09.212
I do!

00:09:14.005 --> 00:09:15.394
All right? Good.

00:09:26.409 --> 00:09:31.823
Yogini: I was wondering if you could
please tell us a bit about meditation,

00:09:31.903 --> 00:09:40.691
about how to improve our meditation and,
if meditation is connected to our heart if…

00:09:40.771 --> 00:09:45.808
I feel that my heart is closed…

00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:47.523
Shri Mataji: Of course.

00:09:47.609 --> 00:09:50.245
Yogini: … that is a problem for my meditation?

00:09:50.326 --> 00:09:51.876
Shri Mataji: Of course.

00:09:51.956 --> 00:09:58.337
See, firstly, you are a liver patient.
You are very right-sided.

00:09:58.417 --> 00:10:05.433
Take treatment [from] your liver and just open your heart.

00:10:05.513 --> 00:10:08.314
Open, I mean I don’t know.

00:10:09.013 --> 00:10:11.818
Just see now, this is how you can open your heart

00:10:11.898 --> 00:10:14.790
and you put Me in your heart, one thing is good.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:20.615
If you can, look at the photograph, say, ‘Come in my heart Mother.’

00:10:20.695 --> 00:10:24.715
I’m such a big person that you’ll have to open your heart

00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:29.895
– otherwise you can’t get Me in.

00:10:30.475 --> 00:10:34.969
All right, so first, open your heart,

00:10:35.429 --> 00:10:38.265
‘Mother, please come in my heart.’

00:10:38.592 --> 00:10:45.366
All right, you say like that. It’s better.

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:54.939
It’s very simple way and I’m at your disposal.

00:10:59.231 --> 00:11:04.578
You see, it happens because of the past,
because people have been unkind to you,

00:11:04.658 --> 00:11:07.021
maybe that you have not forgiven them.

00:11:07.101 --> 00:11:13.958
It can happen with anything and that makes you feel
so closed, isn’t it?

00:11:14.038 --> 00:11:18.174
Because of the experiences
you have had of other people

00:11:18.254 --> 00:11:21.638
and you cannot forgive them.
If you can’t forgive them,

00:11:21.719 --> 00:11:25.384
then you become like that; your
heart is closed, you can never be happy,

00:11:25.464 --> 00:11:30.001
you are very critical of others.
All these things come with a closed heart.

00:11:30.082 --> 00:11:33.658
You cannot feel happy yourself.
You don’t make others happy.

00:11:33.738 --> 00:11:43.845
Now how do you open your heart is just
to feel for everyone, think about others.

00:11:45.828 --> 00:11:51.453
So when you think about others, you see,
this Divine Power thinks about you.

00:11:51.533 --> 00:11:56.412
But when you are thinking about yourself,
you are extremely miserable, horrible person.

00:11:56.493 --> 00:12:00.836
Nobody likes you. Nobody wants to talk to you
and have anything to do with you

00:12:00.916 --> 00:12:03.377
because you are so much concerned about yourself,

00:12:03.457 --> 00:12:06.308
and but when you think about others

00:12:06.388 --> 00:12:10.744
– small, small things, very small things.

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:16.583
So with that feeling of love for another person

00:12:16.663 --> 00:12:19.661
– it’s pure love, that is what we should have: pure love.

00:12:19.741 --> 00:12:25.657
Without any lust or greed, without anything, just because you want to do it.

00:12:27.677 --> 00:12:36.055
Then it takes up vibrations. I think it touches your heart.

00:12:36.135 --> 00:12:39.742
Small, small things like that touch your heart.

00:12:40.696 --> 00:12:44.373
There’s a way of understanding.

00:12:44.453 --> 00:12:50.913
Now, you’re not doing it just to take anything
out of that person or to chart that person…

00:12:50.993 --> 00:12:55.992
But you are just doing it for love, to express your love, pure love.

00:12:56.072 --> 00:12:58.879
In the same way, in our married life, if you have pure love,

00:12:58.959 --> 00:13:01.720
then you can enjoy husband and wife’s relationship,

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:06.744
but if it is impure, then your eyes are moving here, there looking this, that.

00:13:06.824 --> 00:13:11.933
What’s the use? You must have purity,
specially love when it is pure,

00:13:12.013 --> 00:13:15.008
it’s so joy-giving.

00:13:16.402 --> 00:13:19.003
So now, you can open your heart.

00:13:19.083 --> 00:13:24.114
It’s your love which is
important which, if you don’t do,

00:13:24.194 --> 00:13:28.329
then you are a miserable
creature, absolutely good for nothing.

00:13:28.409 --> 00:13:35.074
You have not used your own capacity to
love others, nor have others loved you.

00:13:35.154 --> 00:13:41.939
It’s like this and you are a miserable creature
all over, so what’s the use of being like that?

00:13:42.019 --> 00:13:51.081
As Sahaja Yogis, you have to be extremely lovable
and filled with pure love, filled.

00:13:51.721 --> 00:13:53.161
May God bless you.
