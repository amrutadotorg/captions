00:01.462 --> 00:05.186
In India we believe that,

00:06.793 --> 00:13.305
that God Himself takes incarnations

00:14.283 --> 00:23.264
with His Vishnu principle whenever
there is

00:25.895 --> 00:34.710
the decline of righteousness
and tries to elevate.

00:38.250 --> 00:46.008
Every incarnation has done lot of work –

00:47.430 --> 00:54.867
[Marathi: “Who is speaking? One should
not speak so loudly.”]

01:04.524 --> 01:09.407
- and have done also work within ourselves.

01:10.021 --> 01:17.937
Now this is the knowledge we had in India,
long time back,

01:18.504 --> 01:24.657
but when they talked about incarnations
people started worshipping them

01:24.858 --> 01:35.134
as some statues or some sort of an images
which were sold in the market

01:35.335 --> 01:42.938
and were made by people who had
no right to do that.

01:43.463 --> 01:49.655
But it is described in the Puranas that
we have got

01:49.856 --> 02:00.265
some of the places where many –

02:05.744 --> 02:09.665
[Marathi: “Who is it? Inform the police.

02:14.145 --> 02:20.459
What is going on? What are the drivers
doing?”.]

02:25.333 --> 02:34.053
They have said that in many places in India
and all over the world

02:34.254 --> 02:45.066
the Mother Earth has created beautiful
deities

02:45.267 --> 02:52.785
to tell the - tell the people or
to sort of tally

02:52.986 --> 02:58.540
with whatever described in those
olden books.

02:58.741 --> 03:04.330
And all these are called as 'Swayambhu',
they are created by themselves.

03:06.174 --> 03:10.268
Unless and until you are a realized soul
you cannot make it out

03:10.469 --> 03:14.468
whether these are real or not.

03:14.669 --> 03:26.021
You have to have vibrations to see that
they emit vibrations quite strongly.

03:26.222 --> 03:31.243
A stone starts emitting vibration, but it
has a form, it has a coefficience,

03:31.444 --> 03:34.424
so how this has been created?

03:35.384 --> 03:41.462
There have been quite lot of miracles
in this country

03:41.986 --> 03:52.732
of these incarnations like Ramadasa who
was the guru of Shivaji Maharaj.

03:52.933 --> 03:59.935
It is said that he, in his own time

04:00.136 --> 04:09.968
the Mother Earth emitted out manifesting
they say five hundred Hanumana.

04:10.169 --> 04:13.972
I don’t know the number is correct or not,
whatever it is.

04:14.173 --> 04:21.736
But the one – they found a statue
in the waters of Angapur.

04:21.937 --> 04:26.303
It was Ramadasa who found it and was
kept there

04:26.504 --> 04:31.696
and there was a statue of another goddess,
Anglaidevi –

04:32.436 --> 04:35.168
must be meaning England I think

04:35.369 --> 04:39.943
goddess coming from England must be
Anglaidevi. Whatever it is.

04:40.144 --> 04:48.305
So they wanted to remove those statues
from there

04:48.722 --> 04:52.722
and they said that the statues would
not move,

04:52.922 --> 04:57.864
so they had to ask for forgiveness and
with great difficulty they could remove

04:58.065 --> 05:01.253
those statues to one place called Chaphal,
where they are kept.

05:01.454 --> 05:05.981
Now why they took it to Chaphal, because
there was one Hanumana created

05:06.182 --> 05:10.453
and this Hanumana, they wanted to change
the face, the architects,

05:10.654 --> 05:14.862
so they went on deep down trying
to find out what is the –

05:15.063 --> 05:19.470
how far does this stone go. So it went on
and on and on and on

05:19.671 --> 05:23.850
for, I don’t know, thousands of feet
they went down

05:24.051 --> 05:28.330
and they saw it was still standing on
one rock straight forward,

05:28.531 --> 05:31.517
so they gave up and they kept as it is.

05:31.718 --> 05:37.072
All such miracles have been here to show
that these are swayambhus.

05:37.273 --> 05:41.398
But then people started making statues
and started worshipping,

05:41.575 --> 05:44.311
then making more statues and worshipping.

05:44.512 --> 05:51.842
As a result, there were incarnations,
other incarnations,

05:52.043 --> 05:56.784
as we think that Dattatreya, the primordial
master,

05:56.985 --> 06:00.488
took incarnations on this Earth and most
of them,

06:00.689 --> 06:07.909
then tried later on to say that we should
not talk of the flower

06:08.110 --> 06:14.553
but we should talk about the honey and
we have to get to the honey.

06:14.754 --> 06:19.599
So they started talking about the Ruh,
about the all-pervading power,

06:19.800 --> 06:25.491
about Brahmachaitanya, all of them
practically talked like that.

06:25.703 --> 06:28.913
Not in the beginning I would say, but later
on when they found that the people

06:29.114 --> 06:33.349
were just busy worshipping any stone,
get from there, put some –

06:33.550 --> 06:37.704
I mean they became just stone worshippers.

06:37.905 --> 06:42.551
So another kind of religion just came in,
which just said that we should believe

06:42.752 --> 06:50.249
in God Almighty and we should just worship
Him as an abstract god.

06:52.818 --> 07:01.432
So, this abstraction also turned out to be
futile because when you talk about flower

07:01.633 --> 07:06.216
you worship the flower and when you talk
about the abstract, you just talk.

07:06.417 --> 07:10.733
It’s a talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
You cannot get to the honey.

07:10.934 --> 07:14.278
So even if you talk of the honey what’s
the use of talking about it?

07:14.479 --> 07:19.919
You have to have it. For that, we have
to become the bee

07:20.120 --> 07:24.489
and that is why it is important that you
have to have your Self Realization.

07:24.690 --> 07:30.347
And in every religion whatsoever, even in
Islam it is said you have to become a wali.

07:30.548 --> 07:34.070
In Christianity it is said you have to be
born again.

07:34.271 --> 07:39.061
In Buddhism it is said you have to become
Buddha, means you should be knowledgeable.

07:39.262 --> 07:43.806
In Mahavira’s things He has said you must
get your Self Realization.

07:44.034 --> 07:46.983
Lao Tse has said it.

07:48.399 --> 07:52.123
Just you should start from Socrates onward.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.843
Of course, we should forget about Plato
and these people

07:55.044 --> 07:59.537
because I don’t think they had much
sense of spirituality.

07:59.738 --> 08:05.232
But most of these people have talked
about Self Realization.

08:05.623 --> 08:09.810
And there’s no religion in which they have
not talked about Self Realization.

08:10.011 --> 08:16.182
Even in the Judaism or where they believe

08:16.383 --> 08:25.331
in the coming of the Saviour
for their salvation,

08:25.532 --> 08:27.499
even they have talked about it.

08:27.700 --> 08:34.508
So it is all described in Koran. There’s
a complete sura describing

08:34.709 --> 08:40.929
about the sent one, means the Avatara,
means the incarnation.

08:41.559 --> 08:44.340
And also said that “you won’t believe,
you won’t accept”

08:44.541 --> 08:48.849
and all those things. So now, once
you are realized souls,

08:49.050 --> 08:53.679
then only you start seeing that all
this talk is futile.

08:53.880 --> 08:58.387
You have to become a realized person.
If you get your realization,

08:58.588 --> 09:03.558
then only you can get over the superficial
illusions

09:03.791 --> 09:07.371
and you can go deep into it.

09:09.755 --> 09:15.770
All these illusions are there in all
the countries,

09:15.971 --> 09:20.165
in all the religions and that’s why
there is a problem

09:20.366 --> 09:28.169
and we have seen people suffering
from the pangs of fundamentalism.

09:28.370 --> 09:32.536
As I have given another lecture
about para-modernism,

09:32.737 --> 09:37.182
in that I have talked about Russia,
that Russia has now withdrawn.

09:37.383 --> 09:43.704
On one side has withdrawn, the rest of the
people, now whom are they going to fight?

09:43.905 --> 09:47.707
If there’s another side is not going
to fight, this side is left out

09:47.908 --> 09:51.801
and they don’t know what to do with
their armaments and everything.

09:52.002 --> 09:55.562
So this was the great work of Gorbachev,
I think,

09:55.763 --> 09:57.985
and he’s a realized soul, so he could
see the point,

09:58.186 --> 10:01.849
and the way he has managed is tremendous.

10:02.463 --> 10:07.557
And now the main problem is fundamentalism
and that comes out of ignorance –

10:07.758 --> 10:12.754
ignorance and also selfishness because
people want to say that

10:12.955 --> 10:17.170
“This is my religion, this is my prophet,
this is my guru,

10:17.371 --> 10:22.830
this is my reli… master” and all
those things.

10:23.031 --> 10:26.634
But actually they don’t belong to any
party, to anyone -

10:26.819 --> 10:29.883
they belong to the whole world.
One can understand

10:30.084 --> 10:34.367
if you establish something for your
protection from other parties,

10:34.568 --> 10:42.025
but to start yourself in a way to establish
a falsehood

10:42.226 --> 10:47.056
surprisingly – very surprising, I don’t
understand human beings.

10:47.257 --> 10:50.160
For such falsehood, they are very
happy to join

10:50.361 --> 10:54.282
and so many will join. Without even
thinking, knowing,

10:54.483 --> 10:57.378
they’ll all club together for a nonsense
like that.

10:57.579 --> 11:00.510
For a nonsense human beings always
club together,

11:00.711 --> 11:04.719
but for a sensible thing they don’t want
to understand.

11:04.920 --> 11:08.909
So now we are coming to the point of puja

11:09.110 --> 11:14.543
because there are so many new Sahaja Yogis
who might not have known what is a puja is.

11:14.744 --> 11:22.774
Now, as it is now, you all believe that
I’m Adi Shakti and you have proof of it.

11:22.975 --> 11:27.450
Puja is one of the way you can have
the proof of it much more.

11:27.651 --> 11:33.769
Because when you are doing the puja
My deities, which are within My chakras,

11:33.970 --> 11:39.510
they get excited and they feel happy
and they want to emit more vibrations.

11:39.711 --> 11:43.560
I mean they start emitting more vibrations…

11:46.431 --> 11:49.048
(“Left Swadhistana”) -

11:51.527 --> 11:57.130
when they start emitting more vibrations,
then you are surprised

11:57.331 --> 12:00.113
that how after puja you get so drenched

12:00.314 --> 12:03.817
and you just feel elevated and
at a much higher level.

12:04.018 --> 12:09.353
Of course, it is true that during the puja
time you feel very much elevated.

12:09.554 --> 12:13.583
For some time you can keep it up. Some
people definitely retain it,

12:13.784 --> 12:16.651
but some people go up and down
like a yo-yo.

12:16.852 --> 12:20.240
They don’t have that capacity to retain it.

12:20.441 --> 12:24.009
That is why one has to meditate
in thoughtless awareness

12:24.210 --> 12:29.465
to keep up that status, that higher status.

12:29.666 --> 12:39.443
But the puja of, only of the Goddess is
allowed, puja of the God is allowed,

12:39.644 --> 12:43.874
but we must know who is the God
or who is the Goddess.

12:44.075 --> 12:47.531
So doing the puja of every person blindly,
anybody

12:47.732 --> 12:50.696
who comes forward, says this and that,
should not be accepted.

12:50.897 --> 12:53.793
You’ll be surprised for the first
four years

12:54.001 --> 12:57.587
I didn’t even allow them to have
any puja whatsoever.

12:57.788 --> 13:00.065
Even they said, “You are our guru,
so you should allow us to have

13:00.266 --> 13:03.895
guru puja.” I said, “Nothing doing.
I will not.”

13:04.096 --> 13:09.277
Then first, after four years,
on the Navaratri day

13:09.493 --> 13:12.035
they wanted to have one puja.
I said, “All right.

13:12.236 --> 13:17.311
You can have it, but very few people.”
And then they found that that puja

13:17.512 --> 13:24.182
gave them so much of vibrations,
so much of elated spirituality

13:24.383 --> 13:28.020
and they touched so many dimensions
suddenly

13:28.221 --> 13:33.190
that then they started requesting Me,
“Mother, you must give me a puja.”

13:33.391 --> 13:37.903
Even in India where we have this system
of puja, people have no idea

13:38.104 --> 13:40.640
how to really do it. It was very
embarrassing,

13:40.841 --> 13:44.092
but I had to tell them each and everything,
“Do like this, do like that,

13:44.293 --> 13:47.336
you must have like this”, it would work
it out this way.

13:47.537 --> 13:50.179
First time I went to Delhi, you’ll be
surprised.

13:50.380 --> 13:54.674
It was... If somebody can get hold of that
photograph I was just shrunk.

13:54.875 --> 13:58.776
I was just shrunk. The whole body
had shrunk. I’d become so thin

13:58.977 --> 14:02.937
and I was so shocked because they were
using all plastics

14:03.138 --> 14:06.382
and things [from/for] used in the thing,
all kinds of things (were there?).

14:06.583 --> 14:08.859
“Oh God,” I said, “Now what to do?”

14:09.060 --> 14:13.964
So I never used to also allow them to give
Me any money or anything before;

14:14.165 --> 14:17.638
then I said, “All right, start with one p”.
They started with one p.

14:17.839 --> 14:21.350
Gradually, they increased; because
I thought that

14:21.551 --> 14:25.853
“They don’t know that you have to use
silver.” And then, out of that money,

14:26.054 --> 14:28.601
I said, “All right, I’ll buy silver.
I’ll put my name on that,

14:28.802 --> 14:32.475
so it’s My property, so whatever you have
given Me is mine,

14:32.676 --> 14:35.295
so-called, and is with you.”

14:35.496 --> 14:43.060
That is how we started this proper
understanding of the thing,

14:43.261 --> 14:49.068
that we have to have a particular type
of metal, particular type of styles.

14:49.269 --> 14:52.796
Now these metals have an effect on us,
very much effect on us

14:52.976 --> 14:56.468
and in what metal you do the puja
also has an effect.

14:56.669 --> 15:01.774
It’s all a science of spirituality, which
one must understand is very important

15:01.947 --> 15:06.007
and should be done in a proper way
if you have to have the best results.

15:06.208 --> 15:10.392
It’s like a science. And so the pujas
started

15:10.593 --> 15:16.734
and I think now people have got quite
a good sense of it.

15:16.935 --> 15:21.522
Now, it is – in Maharashtra specially
they are experts

15:21.723 --> 15:24.211
and it’s very difficult to argue with them,

15:24.412 --> 15:28.487
so they said that “Mother, You are supposed
to - we are supposed to give You a sari.”

15:28.688 --> 15:31.719
But they’re such experts, they said,
“No, we have to give You a sari.”

15:31.920 --> 15:35.546
Then I said, “All right, give Me ordinary
sari, I will not take expensive.”

15:35.747 --> 15:41.780
Then they argued with Me, this thing,
that thing. It went on, on and on and on.

15:42.248 --> 15:46.770
And then it started onto, they said,
“We cannot give you falsery.”

15:46.971 --> 15:51.447
I said, “All right, give Me anything.”
Then it has become so expensive now.

15:51.648 --> 15:54.804
See, so I’ve been requesting that now,
for future,

15:55.005 --> 15:57.751
try to understand that now I’m old

15:57.952 --> 16:03.573
and to an old Goddess you can give
something simple. There’s…

16:06.289 --> 16:09.783
But nobody is willing to accept. “Now we
are growing so much, this, that”.

16:09.984 --> 16:13.787
All right, let us see how we reconcile
each other.

16:13.988 --> 16:19.935
So this is how it is, that it makes no
difference, but it does in a way

16:20.136 --> 16:25.229
what importance you give to everything
that you want to do.

16:25.430 --> 16:31.339
It’s very important, is the complete
attention, dedication

16:31.540 --> 16:35.470
and the complete importance that you give
to anything that you do;

16:35.671 --> 16:42.321
is very important. If you do not give it
the highest priority, it doesn’t work.

16:42.585 --> 16:46.261
If it is just by the way it doesn’t work.

16:46.462 --> 16:50.375
So it is important to understand that if
you have to gain anything

16:50.576 --> 16:54.316
in this puja you have to give it
the highest priority.

16:54.517 --> 16:57.995
And then just before puja, if your mind
is telling you or doubting,

16:58.196 --> 17:02.588
just tell him to stop because that mind
can act against you.

17:02.789 --> 17:10.443
So for the puja, you should be all prepared
in a way, in a receptive way and receive it.

17:10.644 --> 17:15.806
You all understand quite a bit English. Whatever
I have said now, you already know that,

17:16.007 --> 17:25.690
whenever you perform a puja, it pleases very
much the deities who are residing in Me.

17:25.891 --> 17:28.576
And they start emitting vibrations
with full force,

17:28.777 --> 17:30.260
sometimes more than necessary -

17:30.461 --> 17:33.023
whether you absorb or even when you are
not able to absorb those vibrations.

17:33.224 --> 17:36.591
When you all are not able to absorb
the vibrations it causes lot of pain to Me.

17:36.792 --> 17:42.860
That is why you all should sit in puja
with an open mind and heart.

17:43.061 --> 17:51.211
The more conviction you have, the more
you will able take advantage from it.

17:51.412 --> 17:54.913
You should have pure desire. You have to
sit with pure desire and you have to ask:

17:55.114 --> 18:01.703
“Mother, please colour my inner self
in such manner
