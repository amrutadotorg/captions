00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.500
So we invited you to come this afternoon - I recognize it's a Saturday afternoon but

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:22.340
glad that you took the trouble to come over here today uh.. as Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi is here in Bombay

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.480
and we thought it would be a good idea if there was an interaction with the Press.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.400
All of us here, who have been followers of Shri Mataji,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.360
feel very strongly that uh.. the message of Shri Mataji, who was the founder of sahaja yoga,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.300
is a very important message not only for India but for the whole world as such and this is shown in practice.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:58.020
The persons you see over here, they are Scientists, Medical doctors, Psychiatric doctors, businessman, lawyers,

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.260
- diplomats
- diplomats and who have achieved very considerably in their own lives.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.660
Now, the message of sahaja yoga has been going very far and deep in their own country. We have guests over here from the Soviet Union.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.760
and uh.. in the Soviet Union in very recent months, Shri Mataji has been there three times

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.940
and Her meetings have been chaired by, attended by very senior people in their government and thousands upon thousands of people.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.400
Over here, even as follow-up meetings after Shri Mataji has left the Soviet Union,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.120
uh.. some of our group members here, who have been there, even their, to their meetings thousands of people coming.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.100
So, it's a very important message that is going through. It's something which is very deep -

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.760
we thought we would like to share it with you because we believe it's very important for India as well - it's important for our country.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.760
The times are such that uh.. sahaja yoga is very relevant

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.000
and almost everybody here has something very special to relate. I don't think there's time for everybody

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.180
but we do have a number of people who are uh.. sahaja yogis who are either scientists or others,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.400
who may talk to you for a few minutes and, come to and, and give you their experiences.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:28.320
In the Press we read all kinds of things, we

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.620
it's, we get news about so many things that's the reason it's, it's one of the main means by which people, we communicate in the mass

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.360
and if there's something good to communicate, if there's something positive, something that has a relevance, something that will

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.420
have, has a future in which things are going to change, something which has very many interesting facets to it

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.260
I, I believe it would be interesting to you as well and that's what uh.., why we requested you to come this afternoon.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:08.560
We have uh.. Shri Mataji's own work for the last twenty years, where

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.300
as the handout might be there, but as you uh.., uh.., if I may please introduce this very briefly

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.560
that Shri Mataji comes from, as was born in the Salve family in 1923.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.920
Shri Mataji has fought in the Independence struggle, She's been jailed as a student leader and thereafter

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.400
uh..been married to Mr. C.P. Srivastava of the I.A.S. Mr. Srivastava's career's

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.860
very well known here. He was uh... in the I.A.S., he also became Chairman and Managing Director, Shipping Corporation.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:50.040
Just prior to that he was Special Secretary to Mr. Lal Bahadur Shastri when Mr. Shastri was Prime Minister and in the last sixteen years

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.840
he has been Secretary General of the United Nations Agency on Shipping

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.400
and living in London - both he and Shri Mataji's their main residence has been in London and each

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.880
four years - this is an elected post, it's not a post where you have uh..

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.740
India has any right on it. It could be anybody in the world could be elected to this post and each

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:20.840
four years he's been elected unanimously. He's just completed sixteen years there and earned many trophies, many medals and

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:28.400
recognition from more than thirty or forty countries. But in the last twenty years Shri Mataji has been

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.880
coming out and talking about sahaja yoga and slowly the

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:40.040
people have recognised around Her and today sahaja yoga has spread to more than thirty or forty countries.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.380
Shri Mataji's message is about the

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.540
recognition of one's own potential, one's own energy inside and it actually happens - it's not just the talk.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.000
It's also totally related to what has been written in our shastras from beforehand

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:10.740
that there is a Primordial energy, that there is it's reflection within, within ourselves that's called the Kundalini.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:18.800
The Kundalini is of the form of the mother within one and in the presence of Shri Mataji or Her photograph, the Kundalini rises

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:26.920
and you have the actual experience yourself. You feel a silence within one, it's a complete sort of

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.720
happiness, total awareness, you feel a cool breeze in your hands, the cool breeze on your heads

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.420
and this is an actual experience of thousands and tens and tens of thousands of people not only in India but all over.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.840
It's possible today, if you like and if you request Shri Mataji, maybe you could also have it but perhaps it might be good idea to

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.760
invite some of our friends here to give a talk for a few minutes, if Shri Mataji if You permit.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.920
Now, I think, I will ask Dr. Rai because in, he went to - he actually uh.. was very successful in

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:10.880
a Neurologist meeting there in Russia. Not only that but, I mean, he was amazed the way

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.720
the Neurologist uh.. saw the point and understood the working of the Parasympathetic and all that

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.220
so I would like him to say few words first of all. [HINDI - INKO WOH DE DO] Thank you.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.460
Now here, he was, he was head of that Physiology department Delhi University.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.840
[HINDI - PEHLE INHE BATA DIJIYE KI [UNCLEAR]]

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:40.840
Haan, ladies and gentleman - you see, first I would like to introduce myself. I've been a Professor and Head of the Department of Physiology

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:47.320
at Maulana Azad Medical College, then I was the Chief of the Physiology Department at JIPMER, Pondicherry

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:54.880
and recently I was the Chief of the Department of Physiology and also Medical Supritendent of The Lady Hardinge Medical College

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:02.420
and the Sucheta Kriplani Hospital. Now first I would like to tell you that how I came into sahaja yoga.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:10.420
Now, I listened to the talk of Shri Mataji in 1984 and, as Mr. Rajesh Shah has told you,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:17.400
that in the presence of Mother the Kundalini of a person awakens and he gets the experience of a cool breeze.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:25.600
Now all the persons present in the hall got the experience of the cool breeze but unfortunately, I had a little doubt in my mind

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.740
as many persons initially have, so I very humbly requested Shri Mataji

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:39.400
that, "Mother, I would like to do some research work because I would like to find out whether actually

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:45.280
one gets the feeling of the cool breeze or it is simply a subjective feeling or

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:53.720
You told me earlier also it might be due to hypnosis or other thing." So I took the permission of Shri Mataji

00:07:54.820 --> 00:08:01.860
into my University faculty meeting and I told them that, "I want to work on sahaja yoga and to establish

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:08.520
whether one gets the cool breeze or not." There was a little opposition in the faculty meeting

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:15.820
because they wanted to work more on  fundamental aspects but ultimately seeing that yoga is very important

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:23.400
and one must know what happens, you see, when yoga is done in the body, the University agreed on it

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:30.580
and got it recognised as a subject for research. Now, two of my students, you see, - I took one student,

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:38.020
who did a Doctorate on sahaja yoga philosophy and he tried to find out that what are the physiological effects

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:46.480
of the Kundalini awakening by sahaja yoga? That was the first thesis done. It was presented, scrutinised by the examiners

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:54.320
foreign as well as outsiders and uh.. Dr. Sethi, who was the my student, got the degree of Doctorate

00:08:54.780 --> 00:09:00.060
uh.. in Physiology Medicine on this subject. Another student Dr. Chugh is here,

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:07.560
uh.. he was the next my student, Post Graduate student and he has also been given the degree of Doctor of Medicine

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:15.880
on sahaja yoga. His work was on the role of sahaja yoga in  the treatment of Psychosomatic diseases.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:22.540
So these were the two thesis and they were very highly credited by the examiners and in

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:30.620
Lady Hardinge Medical College we also started giving sahaja yoga to the patients, you see, for the treatment of Psychosomatic diseases.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:37.120
Because of the first discovery, you see, of the Physiological effects, we found that one is doing a sahaja yoga, you see,

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:44.140
there is a change, a profound changes in the body which occur and which are very important, you see,

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:50.200
uh.. for their utility for the human-beings. Because in modern age, you see, we find what happens is

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.540
that we are going into stress and strain of life. If you read, you see, the Medical literature you find

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:04.660
people say that it is the Psychological stress which is responsible for increasing incidence of Hypertension in

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:12.760
most of the Western countries, developing countries as well as the developed countries. And we found by our first thesis, you see, which work was done,

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:20.320
that this could be a very important, if a person practices sahaja yoga, the stress factor can be managed very nicely

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:27.660
because all the parameters, you see, for testing whether person is in state of stress, tension or anxiety

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:35.780
are his in a relaxed state were, are done and we found that a person who did sahaja yoga only for twenty minutes a day,

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:43.280
you see, in about three to four months time there were changes in blood, there were changes in the heart, there were changes in the

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:50.180
electroencephalograph, there were changes in the muscle activity uh.. and the changes in the Neurotransmitter.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:57.700
One of the very important neurotransmitter Adrenaline, you see, which is produced by the stimulation of the Sympathetic Nervous system

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:04.680
when you are anxious, you see, you are in tension, what happens is there is greater pouring of Adrenaline in the body

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:12.060
and as a result of which your heart beat increases, you see, and you find uh..there is a muscle, you see, blood Lactic acid increases

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:20.040
and persons if they are having accumulated stress for years together, you develop various type of Cardio-Vascular disorders,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:25.160
like essential Hypertension is one, Ischemic heart disease is another and even Arrhythmia.

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:31.060
So, we try to find out that how uh..we try to do it on the patients

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:38.120
and that is how the work of Dr. Chugh started, you see and we did the work on patients and we

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.300
took two groups, you see, we took the patients of Hypertension as well as Bronchial Asthma.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:49.420
Bronchial Asthma also has got a Psychological factor in it, stress factor. We took these two groups

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:56.640
and, to our surprise, we found it gave a dramatic affect. 98%, if I am correct,

00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:02.780
you see, the patients of hypertension improved and then they were without drugs on follow-up

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:09.160
and they had no [UNCLEAR]. The other group, which was simply on drugs, was not cured, you see, and they

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:17.000
were getting, you see, their blood pressure very high uh.. and so we concluded that if a person is doing sahaja yoga,

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:24.700
regularly then you find the essential hypertension can be treated and the persons who are prone to essential hypertension

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:31.200
you see, they can be prevented and similarly in Bronchial Asthma, you see, we found that was very, very helpful.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:38.640
Now after this, you see, we uh.. recently went to Russia, you see, and in Russia, you see, we

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:46.120
I attended a conference in Yalta and the conference was very good because the, the role was there the

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:53.680
uh.. it was on the yoga and Self regulation and this was organized by the people of non-traditional medicine.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:13:01.460
In Russia also people want that, they are fed up with the drugs, and they want that there should be a system of medicine, you see,

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:06.680
which may be non-traditional and they found that yoga is very good.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:13.920
So many types of yogic were there -  you see,T.M. people were there, Rajnishites were there, you see, the Brahma

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:20.960
kumaris were there, magneto therapy were there, so many were there. But in the end of the conference, you see, they found

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:27.880
they were convinced that sahaja yoga is one of the best and it is a scientific work has been done, it has been proved statistically

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:34.040
that, you see, the person who is doing sahaja yoga, is able to regulate his brain activity.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:42.440
You see, as Mother has told, you see, when one is doing sahaja yoga, you are in balance. The activity of the Sympathetic and Parasympathetic

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:49.280
it is modulated and you are in a balance and that is how when a person is doing sahaja yoga

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:55.760
your diseases are automatically cured. Moreso, they are prevented. If a normal person is doing

00:13:55.880 --> 00:14:03.000
you can prevent the occurence of disease. So, in Yalta conference was very nice. Then in Moscow we had another conference

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.880
and there too it was a conference on yoga and sports

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:12.220
and I told them, if a person - you see, there what happens there in sports also they are in great tension

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:18.700
because finding out that they should be able to keep the time, you see, and they should win in it and all those things

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:26.520
so I told them, if a person is doing sahaja yoga, you see, they will be able to manage the stress factor which is there.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:33.960
And again, you see, it also because it acts at the level of the limbic system, you see, it might help

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.900
in the efficiency as well. Then I, I gave a talk in the Institute of Neurology

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:48.460
at Leningrad, you see, it is one of the very famous institute there - they do a lot of operations and they requested me to give a talk

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:56.280
because they said ki they are also very much affected by uh.. the hypertension because what happened tension is there,

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:02.380
many people develop hypertension so they said ki we want to do it and they took the realization

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.080
and 90% people, doctors who were there, they got the realization.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:13.200
Now, another thing we are doing in Delhi nowadays, is the affect of sahaja yoga on Epilepsy.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:21.120
So they got very much interested to do work on Epilepsy because the granuloma epilepsy can have no treatment

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:27.800
and the drugs which are given they are to be given for the whole life. So they said it would be very good idea

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:32.640
if Dr. Rai you could get this thing done here and,

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:38.260
and we are thinking, they have signed rather a project also where we will go and

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:45.600
give them the initiation, sahaja yoga, the patients and they will try also to find out that what is the result.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:52.660
In Delhi we are doing it in collaboration with the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences - the results are very good.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:59.400
We are finding that the attacks of epilepsy, you see, are decreasing when a person is doing sahajayoga.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:06.640
So and then you see, we had also did some public lectures and as Rajesh Shah told you just now

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:13.900
you see, about 1500 to 2000 people were attending the lectures and there were requests from many places

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:21.880
that many centers may be opened. We have already got a center at Leningrad, Moscow, Kiev and Sochi.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:27.320
They are the four places where the centers are there but they wanted center at Tashkent,

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:34.960
Yalta, [UNCLEAR - NOGINSK?] and Siberia and so on. So there was a very good response and the people think there

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.720
that this could be one of the non-traditional system of medicine uh.. in Russia.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:46.860
They are very much. You see, the Ministry of Education, we had a meeting with them and uh..

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:55.120
there, I think, the Deputy Minister was very much interested and he said, "Dr. Rai can it help it in the development of the children,

00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:02.840
can it help at the rehabilitation centers?" I said, "Certainly." Because, you see, as a physiologist I know

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:09.040
that if the actualization of the Kundalini takes place at the level of the limbic system,

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:16.600
which affects the behaviour of a person, naturally it is going to be a very successful because the behaviour of these

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.260
children, you see, in the orphanages, you see, is a little different.

00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:29.540
So, if they do it and practise, it comes down to a little normal level. So they are thinking of doing a research on this as well.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:37.320
Similarly, in other other schools also they wanted because it can also uh.. increase the creativity in children

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.480
because of the connections of the limbic systems with the frontal lobe.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.640
You find the children who are doing sahaja yoga, they excel in their performance.

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:54.860
This is our own experience, Mother. At Delhi we have seen, some of the children who were very poor and who were coming to the centers and doing this,

00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:03.080
they stood first in their classes - now remarkable! This is all because of the creative power, you see, when the children are doing it,

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:09.220
you see, their Kundalini gets awakened, you see your frontal lobe is also stimulated

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:15.980
which they receive it for the higher intellectual activity. So we find that this is sahaja yoga,

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:20.360
you see. Mother has discovered it, She is the founder of the science of sahaja yoga

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:27.420
and I think, it is a unique yoga and the best yoga which the human mankind can have today.

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:34.860
The drug problem, you see, which is there, can also be solved by this. You see the people are taking drug - why they take drug?

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:41.180
It is because of the tension, because of certain problems, emotional problem, other problems are there.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:49.280
So, if one starts doing it, all these things will improve. I know persons, you see, by my experience, you see

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:56.760
that they have left smoking, they have left uh.. alcohol - persons who have been taking alcohol all their life,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.460
now they don't touch it. They say, "If I can't touch it," even if you offer them. So it's just, things can happen

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:11.360
I think it is a wonderful thing and best for the mankind. Similarly, you see, so much as I told you earlier

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:17.680
the Ischemic heart disease, the heart attacks - now the doctors all over the world know

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:25.880
that it is the psychological stress which is responsible for increasing even the blood cholesterol level.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:31.840
Recently, you see, in the last two years people have found out and that is the cause of the atherosclerosis.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:38.560
Another thing what they have found recently is that this psychological stress, emotional stress

00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:45.620
can cause spiro micro-coronary vessels and thereby can give rise to heart attack and sudden death, Mother.

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:53.080
Now all these things can be prevented, you see, if a person is doing sahaja yoga everyday

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:59.980
for say, about ten to fifteen minutes. So it is very nice, it is a life, I say sahaja yoga

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.700
if you have a sahaja yoga lifestyle, I think you can prevent the heart diseases.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:10.400
So Mother, this is what I think they are. If any questions are there, more welcome to ask.

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:18.640
Now, I would request Dr. Wells, who is incharge of seven hospitals in London, has, is luckily with us

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:24.440
and he will tell you how he has cured patients with sahaja yoga, who suffered.

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:32.260
Shri Mataji - good afternoon ladies and gentleman, my name is Brian Wells. I'm a consultant psychiatrist

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:40.180
in the Riverside Health Authority of London and I sub-specialize in the field of substance misuse which is

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.040
problems with drugs and alcohol. I'm going to be very brief.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:49.800
My own experience in sahaja yoga began in 1982

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:58.140
and I was very skeptical, I was a very cautious Westerner who was very wary of things that were Indian

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:06.180
and I have to say that since 1982 my own life is changed dramatically as a result of

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:13.740
the albiet originally very gradual practice of sahaja yoga and my own health, my own

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:22.060
career, my own well-being has improved enormously. Professionally, I work particularly with heroin addicts.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:29.480
I have to say that I have never seen heroin addicts improve, give up drugs

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.900
and experience a well-being and a joyfulness

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:40.140
like the people who we have in sahaja yoga, who come into sahaja yoga and

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:46.700
they give up their drugs and experience a whole different way of living, a whole different attitude.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:51.560
which is based on these very fundamental principles as taught by Shri Mataji.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:57.700
It's not a form of treatment that is widely used in the West but it's beginning to spread.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:04.940
Similarly a number of people in sahaja yoga had very serious alcohol problems when they arrived.

00:22:05.500 --> 00:22:12.540
These people are now completely alcohol free, living very balanced, very normal and very spiritual lives.

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.960
My own addiction to nicotine was

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:25.660
terminated gradually as I came into sahaja yoga and I found that gradually it became unnecessary to smoke cigarettes

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:31.260
and it became important to be healthy, to be the right weight, to be a balanced person,

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:35.360
to be married, with children leading a normal, healthy life.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.140
My own interest in human well-being

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:48.400
have moved beyond addiction and I've been fortunate in being able to travel to Finland and to the United States this year

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:54.500
largely to present the work of Dr. Deepa Chugh that has already been referred to by the professor.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:59.740
In Finland we presented his work at a Physiology conference which was very

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:07.240
skeptical Western Scientists who were interested in atoms, molecules, enzymes and I stood up on stage

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:14.340
and the audience thought I was a little bit crazy talking about sahaja yoga and it's affects on hypertension

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:22.620
but as I talked it became clear that actually the results of sahaja yoga are very spectacular indeed.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.940
The people who practice sahaja yoga, after sixteen weeks

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:35.420
were on no medication at all and their blood pressure had come down from a very high and dangerous level to a very acceptable level

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:41.160
and the people in the audience had to notice this and came up afterwards and were impressed

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:48.240
and as a result of their suggestions, Dr. Chugh is now publishing his work in the International Medical Press.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:54.940
A few weeks ago, I was in Boston and I presented this work again at a huge conference of American

00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:02.520
Chest and Cardio-thoracic medicine and again we stimulated a great deal of interest because as Professor mentioned

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:09.700
a lot of people are now interested in ways of treating blood pressure, treating chest diseases with methods that do not

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:17.320
involve the use of medication and sahaja yoga is something that's considered unusual by many

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:23.720
Western trained doctors but the results that Dr. Chugh has achieved are indeed very spectacular

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.160
and we have now a number of very eminent researches in United States and in Europe who are

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:38.100
interested in comparing the effects of sahaja yoga against drug treatment and against other forms of realization therapy.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:46.600
So from my own standpoint, sahaja yoga is the best treatment I know for addiction of all kinds whether it is addiction to drugs,

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:54.040
to alcohol, tobacco, to food or to other forms of behaviour. It's a system of becoming balanced,

00:24:54.340 --> 00:25:01.220
- becoming healthy and becoming whole. Thank you for your attention - Thank You Shri Mataji!
- Thank you.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:08.620
Now, what should we have now? Uh.. we have so many doctors here, you see - Dr. Talwar is here - aayeaga.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:16.140
He is from Delhi, then we have Dr. Chugh uh... we have other doctors of scientist here

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:24.060
and we have here on this side Dr. Nigam and Dr. Baghdan who's a Russian

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:32.400
and Dr. [UNCLEAR - SPIRO?] from England. So please come - sab log khade ho jaayein to theek hai - it's better you all stand up here, just let us see.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:38.840
- Aap ek, thode mein keh dijiyega.
- All the doctors
- All the doctors should stand up together.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:44.120
We have minimised their number just to make you understand that

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:52.080
is, this is Dr. Pepe from Spain, then we have Sarah [UNCLEAR] from England - come along.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:59.500
There are seven doctors in England who are doing this research there in England and also there is a research going on

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.800
in the Cambridge University but, by doctor, Derick Lee - he's also here.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:09.440
Luckily they are here so that's why I wanted to have the meeting today.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:16.880
Shri Mataji, we have so many illuminatory sort of

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:24.180
individuals here but we are all at Your feet in collectivity. I just like to say a couple of things -

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:30.360
of course we have all experiences to share otherwise we would not have been in sahaja yoga

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:36.380
If you want to see an example of essential hypertension patient

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:43.860
in a medical person, I'm an example standing in front of you. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] It's five years ago since I gave up drugs

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:52.620
and blood pressure is quite normal. I can tell you that because no doctor spares me to take my blood pressure from time to time

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:58.120
because they're completely enamored with the factor as how could it occur - there's no answer for it.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:04.340
Sometimes, Shri Mataji, when we hear people talking about blind faith, I wonder,

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:11.100
how people can talk about blind faith when they are blind themselves. To be able to understand subtlety of life

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:19.140
one has to have the actual experience. Unless we get the actual experience of Self-realization

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:25.360
on our own Central Nervous System, I don't think anybody has a right to ask for any proofs

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:32.400
because no proof can be given on equipments which are not properly functioning.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:41.040
Now, for that purpose, with due apology Shri Mataji, I would like to point out because it seems to be sensationalization

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:48.660
when individuals want individual proofs from people who have gone through the experience. I'd like them to come forth

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:55.900
and take the experience of Self-realization, feel the whole process on their own Central Nervous System

00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:02.000
and then, I think, they would have a right to ask for proofs, if any, is required by them.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:10.440
My whole family, I may tell you, we were a, shall we say, a zoo of some sort of problems.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.100
My wife was with crippling arthritis

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:22.160
and my son suffered from severe migraine and my daughter-in-law had problems with bronchial asthma and by the Grace of Shri Mataji

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:30.060
by the introduction of these sahaja techniques, practices, in our daily life, we have all got rid of our problems.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:39.300
As a clinical practitioner in Medicine, as a medical specialist, I can say one thing, there are lots of things

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:46.500
which cannot be proved in a laboratory but which is a better proof - the person who's ailment disappears

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:51.600
or the, or the records of a laboratory - I leave it up to you gentleman.

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:58.600
There are so many doctors who follow, I wouldn't like to say anything more but this is just to let you have a feel

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:07.020
that there's much more to life than what is visible in the three dimensions that we are aware. Thank you - thank You Shri Mataji!

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:12.020
You could say about the Parasympathetic Nervous system also

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:21.280
- [UNCLEAR - YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID?] because, you see, it's sounding like magic to them but if you tell them what works it out - isn't it? [UNCLEAR]

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:28.460
- [UNCLEAR -TELL THEM?]]
- About the Parasympathetic? [UNCLEAR]
- Yes, you see how the Kundalini works and how it supplies this thing.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:35.560
Of course, you'll get the little paper to see what is actually, how it works out. You see, also

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:42.180
uh.. you should know because it may sound like a magic to you - it's not magic, it's no magic at all. This power is within us

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:50.780
which rises, actually rises - in some people you can even see the pulsation of the triangular bone and you actually see rising it -

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:57.680
in some people, not all of us, some people. Where there's obstruction you can  see it clearly but some people just it shoots off

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:04.980
and then you can yourself feel the cool breeze on your head, you can feel the cool breeze on your hands but everybody doesn't get it.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:12.680
there could be some people who don't get it. There are some people who didn't get it for, I think, say about two months, three months - but they got it

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:20.320
ultimately - but you have to keep your mind open as any scientist has to. Just to deny something, to say there is no God

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:27.980
is unscientific. You have not found it out where there is God or not so keep it as a hypothesis and see for yourself

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:36.480
if it is not there, if you have found it out it's not there, it's alright but you have not yet found so just to deny something is not

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:43.980
is not scientific at all. So these are all scientists we have. Dr. Nigam is here, all of them are here and

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:50.620
you see, how sahaja yoga - [ASIDE - AAP TASHREEF RAKHIYE - [UNCLEAR]]. Now, you see, this is how I'm asking Dr. Spiro to just tell you

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:58.060
how the Kundalini rises, passes through different centers and how it pierces through the last one here

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:06.080
and what is the result, ultimate result of it which will tell you in short so you will know it's no magic, it's just like a sprouting of the seed -

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:13.140
simple thing as that but as you cannot manifest that - you cannot manifest it normally unless and until you have the Mother Earth

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:18.080
or you have the Holy Mother, I think, you can't do it - that's the only point is. [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:27.760
So, in in brief the hypothesis that we have in sahaja yoga is that, at the base of the spine at the level of the Sacrum bone

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:35.860
there is a vital energy which we call Kundalini and during the process of sahaja yoga

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:41.600
this energy is awakened and rises. Now

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.940
one doesn't have to have any special uh...

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:52.360
depth or experience in order to know that something is happening because as Shri Mataji has just mentioned,

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:59.620
in many cases one can actually see it with the naked eye so it's not, that's not something that one has to

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:05.160
take on trust, is a very simple observation one can make for that for saying that something is happening

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:12.060
which is outside of our normal physiology - it's not something that's explained by the usual

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:18.560
physiology that we understand. Now the nervous system is divided,

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:26.940
for the purposes of this, we can take three main divisions - the right and the left sympathetic and in the center is what, the Parasympathetic

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:31.600
Nervous System and these three together form the Autonomic Nervous System

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:39.660
and this Autonomic Nervous System is collected in, what in medicine we call plexuses,

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:44.940
which in terms of yoga we call chakras which are arranged in the body

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:51.680
and both the right and the left sympathetic contribute elements towards

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:57.900
each of these plexuses so if, if I can just use my hands

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:07.440
it's like that, so the right and the left each form a plexus.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:16.360
Okay, thanks. So, in the normal course of, in the normal situation

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:23.720
one is just using the two sympathetic sides, right and left and so there's a tendency for that central part

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:30.960
to be bit used because this activity on the left or the right and it pulls it a little bit.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:38.680
So in that way the plexus or the chakra, if you like, is being constricted and that means that there is less energy able to flow

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:45.980
through the central channel. What happens in sahaja yoga is that, this process is reversed because the central channel

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:52.080
becomes active for the first time - rather than being a potential source of energy it becomes actual

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:59.720
and so there's the tendency is for the plexus to dilate.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:08.500
So, as Professor Rai has already said, through the practice of sahaja yoga the Nervous System achieves a balance

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:15.640
allowing the vital energy of the body to express itself and in each

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:21.760
at each level of each chakra this happens so the organs at that level are nourished

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:30.400
and it's in this way that the diseases are cured - not that one necessarily needs to even try and cure the disease, it happens automatically.

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.800
- Thank you!
- Thank You, Shri Mataji!

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:42.900
We have so many doctors here and now I would say that, you see this - I, I also had to study medicine to talk to them

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:51.420
and I also read a little bit of Psychology because to talk to them I must use their terminology but all this knowledge is within yourself.

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:58.680
We know very little about it because a very little part, a wee part of our brain

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:05.740
is really manifesting in a human awareness, you see. When the Kundalini rises - actually we have two lobes, we don't have one lobe

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:14.040
so there are two sides to our personality. When the Kundalini rises She enlightens the brain and then you start knowing

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:18.060
many more things which you have never known. For example,

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:25.140
uh.. I'll ask Karan Khurana to come. He was a very ordinary student here who went down to America

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:31.200
and one day he just asked Me a question on Genetics. So Genetics is a very modern science

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.520
but he was amazed - [UNCLEAR] tum bata do.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:46.400
Uh.. I want to share just a small glimpse of Shri Mataji's brilliant knowledge

00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:52.800
because so many people have spoken about sahaja yoga and it's brilliant effects and

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:59.620
during the past seven years I've been a student at the University of California in Santiago

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:08.420
and I've had a chance to attend many lectures in Biochemistry and Genetics and Immunology

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:17.180
and at the end of all the knowledge that is to be shared by the Professors in these brilliant Universities, they all come to the same point

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:23.700
and they say, we cannot play the role of God so we cannot give you all the knowledge.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:32.160
About one year ago I was with Shri Mataji at Her home and during that time

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:39.960
She was explaining about how various, how the knowledge is revealed

00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:48.080
and I asked Her about a question on the genetic effects and how AIDS comes about.

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:55.280
and how on the genetic level we can go about researching on AIDS.

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:03.380
She spoke about how Copper has an effect on AIDS and how in the body due to accumulation of copper

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:10.360
there is a mutagenic effect specially when it accumulates in certain specific parts of the body like liver

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:18.900
and how if the replacement of Copper takes place with a higher element like Zinc, with Platinum and with gold

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:25.160
then that mutagenic effect will not take place. Also She spoke about

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:30.900
enzymology and how when an enzyme interacts with a substrate it

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:36.220
it can cleave for example in a substrate the phosphate bond and reveals

00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:41.580
the iodine which then gives a colour effect and this is a tool that is used

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:47.100
worldwide in diagnostic assays and diagnostic tests, is a clinical tool.

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:55.480
She spoke about how this effect is enhanced and it is very necessary for a uh..

00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:01.160
double positive metal ion to be present otherwise this reaction cannot take place.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:08.400
Scientifically we don't understand how this reaction take place by the enzymes but when she revealed this

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:15.720
I went back to California and I had a discussion with one of the top scientists in enzymology, Dr. Muzaffar Iqbal.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:23.880
He is a Professor from Oxford University who has been there for twenty years and is the top authority on enzymology

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:31.900
and when I spoke to him about this divalent cations that Shri Mataji had spoken about and how we can use this for enhancing

00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:39.860
the stability and interaction and reactions of these enzymes - he immediately did some experiments and he found that

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:47.520
we could actually stabilize these enzymes by the effect of these divalent cations like Magnesium and Manganese

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:56.080
and we found that at 50 degrees temperature these enzymes get stable for three days, which is an absolute revolution.

00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:03.920
These enzymes have to be stored at 2-8 degrees at all times for it to have any interaction or any stability.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:11.920
Also ever since She spoke about the effects of Copper and how AIDS is related

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:19.220
we have many scientists who have been doing research in this field and just three weeks ago I attended a lecture

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:25.080
by Dr. Sochman, who is a leader in this field and he explained how these

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:32.660
uh... metal ions have mutagenic effects and this is something Shri Mataji spoke about a year ago so

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:40.840
this knowledge is definitely there with Shri Mataji and She chooses to speak about it very rarely but those moments are very

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:47.940
uh.. very much cherished by us because this is knowledge of the future - this is Modern Science

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.200
and She's had it for ever, I think.

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:58.680
Thank you very much! Now, there's another, you see, now the point he has brought it that through sahaja yoga

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:07.220
I can give you a, a future plan as to how to make research in what direction

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:15.420
so I would uh.. request Dr. Worlikar who came for your scientific research uh..conference you had

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:23.820
and he was one of the five speakers here and he'll tell you about what I told him about carbon atom and just how he have researched and found out.

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:31.640
So I mean, I can give them a lead to find out what I am saying if it is true or not but one has to be - you see, these are

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:38.040
scientists of a very high degree and high level and they have reached a point where they want to see what is beyond this

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:46.340
and that should be there otherwise with mediocracy uh.. you cannot enter into this area, you see, you have to have that sharpness about it

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:52.400
and this what Dr. Worlikar who has been [MARATHI]

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:58.480
He was one of the scientist who spoke here in your conference, one of the five scientist.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:09.740
Shri Mataji, ladies and gentleman - She has introduced me that

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:18.260
I have been in United States for last eighteen years. I have done my Ph.D. from University of Bombay

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:23.940
with a very eminent scientist called K. S. Nargun, who spent ten years

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:27.940
while working with a Nobel Prize winner Thorpe, in London.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:34.340
After doing Medicinal Chemistry Ph.D in Anti-tuberculosis compounds

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:43.460
I had an opportunity to go to United States where I did work with a scientist called Dr. H. Herbert Fox

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:50.800
who invented Ionish as a drug for tuberculosis. So having been exposed to good scientist

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:58.260
when you do Ph.D. in your life, more you study,

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:04.980
more you realize how little you know and that's what I, I was

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:11.080
all the time thinking in my life is, I wanted a direct connection with All-Pervading power.

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:18.280
So since my childhood I did Atharvasheesh to Lord Ganesha.

00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:25.400
All the Maharashtrians - I'm  Maharashtrian - since my childhood I started worshipping Lord

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:31.140
and Aaradhya devatva was Lord Ganesha. Every time I would do Atharwasheesha

00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:36.940
I would feel everyday there is something beyond this and I was looking for

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:43.320
some guru, who could connect me to All-Pervading power.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:51.120
In 1981, Shri Mataji came to United States and I was blessed by Her.

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:58.460
She raised my Kundalini whereby all the Deities were invoked

00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:07.740
and a different, a different life started after having realized

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:14.860
by Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, my life took a different turn and then

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:22.680
She has blessed me with a special blessing called enlightened attention.

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:28.740
When you raise your Kundalini, the Divine powers of Parvati,

00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:33.880
all the deities on our chakra - there are seven chakras in our body,

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:38.240
the last chakra is Sahasrara chakra of which She is Swamini.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:46.920
By doing Lord Ganesha's worship, the chakras upto Hamsa chakra

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:54.800
get manifested. You get power of discretion but once you get realized

00:43:55.360 --> 00:44:03.320
and the Kundalini is awakened, the power of Parvati awakened, integration of all the chakras takes place.

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:12.380
They work very, very pronouncedly and the vibrations you feel in the form of cool breeze

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:20.480
on your fontanel bone and on your hands, on your palm, indicate the existence of All-Pervading power.

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:27.580
Now when you do meditation - a lot of doctors here mentioned to you about sahaja yoga -

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:35.700
what is sahaja yoga is, is spontaneous union with All-Pervading power. Now once you raise your Kundalini

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:42.560
to a point where my hand is up - is called Valaya - all the incarnations come up to Valaya.

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:47.920
The human-beings have to reach Incarnations at that point so

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:54.960
there is a need for every human-being to get realized, do meditations day in and day out,

00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:02.720
raise your Kundalini, get connected to All-pervading power, then you realize that

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:07.800
guru is the pure source of knowledge. I have read lots and lots of book

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:16.100
in Chemistry. I was a professor of Organic Chemistry in University of Bombay, affiliated college Ramniranjan Jhunjhunwala College.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:24.080
I was teaching in Adarsh Science Institute, where I taught students who have failed at Inter-Science in those days

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:31.840
and my students could become doctors and engineers after attending a one year course which were teaching in a private

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:39.200
institution. I have taught in Agarwal's classes for I.I.T. entrance exam where

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:46.620
students who have stood first in S.S.C., second, used to attend a lecture and

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:54.140
eight hundred students used to come all over India and they used to stand from Agarwal's classes uh.. where

00:45:54.460 --> 00:46:01.700
the maximum high level education was imparted to them and from that institution

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.960
thirty students, first thirty students used to be from Agarwal's classes. What I'm trying to tell you is

00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:17.400
before getting realized there was a particular shape of my life

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:21.460
but after meeting Her I went to completion.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:30.300
Once you are connected to All-Pervading power - why I taught, brought this subject, I was professor of Organic Chemistry

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:37.760
I had a habit of reading, most of the time, books written by Nobel Prize winners from U.C. Berkeley,

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:44.120
Mahan's book was, was good for Tacheometry. There's a chapter, one chapter and I would read

00:46:44.420 --> 00:46:50.300
ten different books from foreign authors who had, one time or other, acquired Nobel Prize.

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:58.380
I used to get thrilled and I used to, as a magnanimity of scholarship, share everything with my students

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:05.800
and with high level students my level used to go high and I studied at a very high level

00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:11.440
Electronic theory of valency, which after getting realized from Mother,

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:19.780
I found a different dimension, that you are given things if you are having enlightened attention.

00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:27.240
What I thought, I don't know, I don't see a picture which we call Virata where

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:33.480
all the seven chakras are presented to the audience where you can

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:38.680
clearly visualize the seven chakras in every human body starting with Muladhara chakra.

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:44.740
- Now the - yes, yes  correct - you have a
- [MARATHI] Muladhara
- Yeah, yeah

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:50.500
- [MARATHI]
- So
- Chemistry

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:58.520
I was attending a guru puja in Santa Cruz and was concentrating on the Muladhara chakra

00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:06.940
where we have four plexus to Muladhara chakra which is considered to be Lord Ganesha's chakra - seat for Lord Ganesha.

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:15.060
Now what I did is, while doing meditation I was directly connected and

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:23.520
I was given a inspiration that I should depict that chakra in three dimension.

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:31.280
If you see the Muladhara chakra in the, in the Virata there picture, it is only Swastika there

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:36.340
- It is below the Kundalini
- so what I did

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:41.520
is - by the blessing of enlightened attention She had bestowed on me -

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:49.440
we made a three dimensional structure of Carbon atom being a organic chemist and then used

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:55.940
the Electronic theory of valency to formulate

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:04.860
the valencies of carbon atom on modern basis. Just in one short sentence I could say that,

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:12.480
the structure of atom was proposed by Danish Physicist Neil Bohr, who got a Nobel Prize for that.

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:18.080
He discussed the movement of electrons which have speed of light around a nucleus

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:25.880
and give a mathematical expression for Hydrogen spectrum as a proof, single electron atom and then

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:30.940
he got a Nobel Prize. His theory of orbit became obsolete

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:37.580
when we came into Heisenberg's uncertainty principle where you cannot predict the position of a moving body.

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:45.460
So currently we consider orbital theory - the position of any moving body cannot be predicted therefore

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:52.480
we consider a, a area in space - space where you can locate the electron

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:59.460
- Now I have a article - Mother asked me to put the thoughts
- I, I think his article is there
- Yeah

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:03.720
- There is a article on cosmic relation of Swastika and Om
- [UNCLEAR]

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:11.420
Now what I did is, made a tetrahedral structure of Carbon atom, put Carbon in the center

00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:19.660
and considered the latest orbital theory of movement of electron in space and in that

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:28.040
I considered Carbon has four electrons - one in a 2s orbital which is spherical

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:34.520
and three electrons in the dumbbell shaped orbital which is in X, Y and Z axis

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:39.780
The 2 [UNCLEAR - PZ?] orbital is vacant no electron there but

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:45.280
in the excited state one electron from 2s goes to 2pz and then

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:50.520
to an ordinary person when you think ordinarily, you will find

00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:57.120
three energy levels of those three electrons should be same and one in 2s in a lower energy

00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:03.120
is different. So it bothered me as a student of Organic Chemistry that Carbon should have three

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:09.440
equal valencies and one weak valency. [UNCLEAR] something we could discuss somewhere else

00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:16.460
let me just concentrate on what I did. So we made a actual tetrahedral structure and

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:22.900
took the advantage of modern theory of electron valency and considered orbital theory.

00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:30.740
What I found when I was putting my enlightened attention - let me tell you the significance of enlightened attention.

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:38.300
When you raise your Kundalini and put your attention on the Kundalini, your attention gets enlightened.

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:44.220
If you put it on any unknown thing, that thing reveals it's true nature.

00:51:44.860 --> 00:51:48.840
So you are given things when you are connected to All-Pervading power.

00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:55.880
So I was putting my enlightened attention to this tetrahedral model of Carbon atom, just trying to see

00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:03.440
the four valencies of Carbon in space considering the orbital theory.

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:11.960
I, I had a computer scientist help me, from Belgium, Youhann and another sahaja yogi from

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:19.980
Chicago, Boston and he made the tetrahedral structure

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:27.520
and we, me and Youhann used to sit at my house in Los Angeles and put our attention on that model

00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:34.200
trying to see Om. I would see 3 but I wouldn't see

00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:39.640
I could, I wouldn't see the upper residual valency and

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:46.020
we used to put lot of enlightened attention, meditation - sahaja yoga practices

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:49.560
is nothing else but everyday you do meditation.

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:56.080
Now what we found, with the enlightened attention what I found, that one of the valency

00:52:56.600 --> 00:53:03.560
was not properly done by Jay because he just made all four dumbbell shaped orbitals.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:10.080
He forgot to do sp3 hybridisation where all the four uh..

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:15.240
sphere orbitals rearrange themselves - is called sp3 hybridisation

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:19.280
where we call one electron in s orbit and three in p orbital.

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:28.280
After I did that sp3 hybridisation I could clearly see the residual valency of the Om.

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:34.440
From the end, end view - see as a student of Technical School Robert Technical School so

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:37.840
- I said, "Let me take a look at this model from

00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:44.360
- from the left
- from the left
- If you see from the left, right I told them you will see Aum and they saw it.
- Yeah

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:52.680
So from the left I saw Aum. Now I said,  "Let me see from the right what do I see," and I saw Swastika.

00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:59.520
Same three dimensional figure you can see Aum from one side and Swastika from other side.

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:08.040
- and was amazed to see that, the correlation, I call it cosmic correlation between Aum and Swastika
- [UNCLEAR - MARATHI]

00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:14.820
and then I met Shri Mataji in Houston - She was visiting U.S.A. and

00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:20.640
She said, "Did you take a look at your tetrahedral model from the bottom,"

00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:24.120
and I said, "No Shri Mataji, I haven't."

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:35.080
She said, "If you take a look to your tetrahedral model from the bottom, I'm sure you will see cross."

00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:43.540
So I returned from Texas to my house in Los Angeles and to my surprise, when I took a look at

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:50.580
the tetrahedral model, I had made, from the bottom, it, it gave

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:59.080
cross sign - it depicted cross. So you see how they are, they are coordinated with each other.

00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:07.360
This was possible because of enlightened attention that was bestowed on me by Shri Mataji.

00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:14.260
Now, what I have to say is Aum - as you know, Pranava, the sound of creation -

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:21.540
is represented by, when we write it on two dimension, we write Aum.

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:29.040
Actually, Aum is a three dimension, dimensional depiction of the sound of creation

00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:38.600
and Swastika is the two dimensional depiction of Aum. It is hard to see this difference

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:44.700
when we write Aum and Swastika side by side on a blackboard, let us say, which we call two dimension.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:51.920
So, I have been a student of science all throughout my life and I had

00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:56.460
kept open mind when She came to Los Angeles, in 1981.

00:55:56.760 --> 00:56:02.360
1986 I was speaking on the event of Her birthday, I told everybody

00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:08.160
that you people are in India, you are lucky. You could get your realization

00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:15.980
and you will have a different dimension to your life. I had to go all the way to America to get realization.

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:21.480
I would like Dr. Mishra to tell you something about the soul

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:28.360
because there's always a challenge about soul and dead soul and this and that and whatever I told long time back

00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:34.040
how now they have discovered that it exists. I'm just trying to show you because this is a unique thing

00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:40.560
and we, as he says, that he had to go to America but only in America they will understand it, not in India - I know this.

00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:47.560
- Why, why not in India?
- You see because you have to reach that state of, I should say, of search

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:55.240
see they have reached the la.... You see here, our, our heritage is Spirituality not Science

00:56:55.720 --> 00:57:02.200
but in America it is Science. So they have reached to the end of it, you see, sort of they have reached to the end of everything - extremes -

00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:10.380
so scientists there start looking back while ours is, we can understand it much faster because our heritage is this.

00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:17.700
Our heritage is true Spirituality but as scientists, it's only in the West they will understand because they have reached to the end of it, you see,

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:25.680
so they want to see it much faster. Like as he said it, in Russia - Russian scientists are of a very high level.

00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:32.640
You know they have - one fellow gave Me a book on the Mathematical Calculation of Shri Chakra

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:38.480
and he came and asked Me, then I told him about Shri Chakra and all that. He was amazed, he said, "Nobody knows this in India, how's it?"

00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:44.880
I said, "We're still uh.. running after you scientist, you see, still we are trying to work,"

00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:51.320
but, you see, Science itself you know, has to be balanced uh.. with uh..

00:57:52.020 --> 00:57:59.720
other things like Humanity because Science itself is very dry. Now, the Science also can take advantage of sahaja yoga as doctor

00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:06.040
has told you. Now what sahaja yoga has done, is to abridge the gap between the Spirituality -

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:11.620
of the true Spirituality, the knowledge of Spirituality and the Science as they have done it. So I would like,

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:18.780
one more doctor to tell you, Dr. Misra. He's, he's, I asked him to write your degree so he wrote so many so now, I don't know, he

00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:27.280
he will tell you about the soul what I said. Whatever I have said they could prove it so this is, this is something, the way they have bridged it, you see,

00:58:27.640 --> 00:58:34.160
but the kind of patience they have, the kind of respect they have - we don't have that so much about scientifically.

00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:39.820
If there's a scientist in India, he wouldn't have that much of openness - is a fact, I tell you.

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:44.480
But we have some scientist here from India also. Bataiye

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:47.860
Shri Mataji and fellow colleagues,

00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:56.160
my name is Ram Mishra and I did my undergraduate medical degree in New Orleans, Louisiana

00:58:56.520 --> 00:59:03.260
followed by a doctorate in Biochemistry at Memorial University in Canada. Currently I'm Professor of Psychiatry,

00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:08.860
Director of Neuro-psyche [UNCLEAR] pharmacology laboratory and Consultant to

00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:15.900
mental NIMH - it's National Institute of Mental Health, United States, Medical Research Council of Canada

00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:21.360
Ontario Mental Health foundation, National Council of Canada, NCIA of United States.

00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:27.820
Now, I have been heavily engaged in research activities

00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:32.420
relating to cell membranes and the different types of the interceptors

00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:40.460
and in last four or five years it became very clear that the variety of drugs, variety of

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:49.180
medicines - the drugs is a bad name sometimes - uh.. interact with the specific types of the receptors on the cells

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:57.020
for example the antihypertensive drugs interact with the beta-receptors, sulphur receptors in heart cells,

00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.920
asthmatic drugs interact with the beta-receptors in the lungs,

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:08.480
the antipsychotic drugs, antischizophrenic drugs, antiparkinsonian drugs, anti-anxiety drugs,

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:14.820
anti-huntington's chorea drugs - they all interact with the set of the receptors and

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:21.920
when we look at the structure of the receptors - now other scientist who already got the Nobel Prize,

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:29.340
discovered the beta-receptors structure and I was working on the dopamine receptor which interacts with the

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:37.120
uh... neurotransmitters and the antipsychotic drugs. Now what is common in all these receptors is that,

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:43.540
they always make a seven member membrane loop. Now the words in the membranes

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:52.400
they organized in such a way so you always have seven loops - not eight, not nine, not six, not twelve - always have seven.

01:00:54.340 --> 01:01:02.280
- And when I was lecturing in the class that these receptors make seven loops.
- Seven loops
- They  organize  in such a fashion

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:10.520
that they always make seven loops. Now there are different kinds, there are one thousand different kinds of receptors but each one make a seven loop and the,

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:18.740
obviously the M.B.B.S. students asked me the question, "Why there is seven loops, why not nine, why not eight?" and I said that has

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:24.880
I kept quiet actually and then there was another student who said, "It has something to do with the God."

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:29.760
So, that was the actual answer and

01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:36.540
fortunately I met Shri Mataji in London one time and had a chance to

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:42.820
to show the diagrams and the pictures of the different types of the receptors

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:46.400
and you can also see yourself there are

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:51.760
several types of the receptors on this sheet from human, from bovine, from red

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:56.440
and if you look very carefully, they always make the seven loops.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:02.180
If you look at the three dimensional structures or the models of -

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.640
you can also see the seven rings in these receptors. Now,

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:14.300
what is the significance of these seven rings? I think

01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:22.140
to me they look like they represent the mini chakras in each cell and specially in the heart cells

01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:29.820
they represent the soul, so after a person passes away

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:36.220
or dies or whatever happens, these souls

01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:42.980
who represents in seven rings are released in the atmosphere and it is possible for the sahaja yogis

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:48.900
who practices sahaja yoga, to see the unsatisfied souls in the sky and in fact

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.960
when we were having a meeting in New York, in July, Shri Mataji said that, "Look

01:02:53.440 --> 01:03:00.080
those unsatisfied souls in New York city are wandering around in the sky and in fact we were able to see those

01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:08.320
like loops there. By the same [UNCLEAR - TOKEN?] you can also see the Chaitanya, the satisfied souls

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:14.880
- you see in the form of the Chaitanya.
- Like, like uh.. you see them like commas, shining commas - Chaitanya
- shining commas

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:22.780
So, that's the, that's the scientific proof. Uh.. the other thing I want to share with you is, is a follow-up

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:30.500
experiment actually we did blindly. I didn't know Dr. Chugh before I came here and he described his M.D. thesis

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:38.680
while I met Shri Mataji in Guru Puja in Italy and I took Her permission to do couple of experiments of my own in my own lab

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:46.320
and didn't publish the study because it is still in the very preliminary state but

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:53.400
I can assure you that it will be published in the - by blessings of Shri Mataji - in the first rate Scientific journal in United States.

01:03:53.940 --> 01:04:01.780
And the story is that we looked at the levels of the relaxing proteins called beta endorphins and enkephalins.

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:09.220
Now these are the proteins which try to take your pain away, try to make you relax

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:15.820
and do a lot of other things in the human system. And when the levels of these proteins goes down

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:22.740
you suffer from many, many things - your blood pressure, your pain levels, your arthritis and so on so forth.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:31.900
Now, if you practice sahaja yogas, the levels of these Beta Endorphins and Enkephalins actually goes up.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:39.620
They goes up significantly compared to the other types of meditations like T.M. or Hatha yoga or whatever.

01:04:39.980 --> 01:04:47.060
Now the same question was asked to Dr. Chugh in his Ph.D. thesis by the examiners that, "Have you looked at the levels of the Beta Endorphins?"

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:55.800
and what was your, I don't know what you replied to them that, "You haven't done it," but the, the answer was already there in our lab -

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.060
see how the connections are made to find out, find out the answer for the same question!

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:08.380
Now, we have agreed that we will measure the levels of these proteins and see ourself from

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:15.800
Indian sahaja yogis, from European sahaja yogis, from American and Canadian and we will see in worldwide

01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:23.100
geographical distribution in all sahaja yogis the levels of these proteins goes up. I think I should stop at this point.

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:34.620
Uh.. I would also request a diplomat from U.N. to talk what U.N. has to say about it

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:42.640
because is important. We in uh.. in our country do not know what we have

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:50.800
but the UN system itself has now accepted that Spirituality is a part and parcel of a human-being

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:55.100
and it must be looked after and he will now tell you. This is

01:05:55.600 --> 01:06:02.880
Mr. Gregoire de Kalber de matten from - he is a Swiss diplomat. We have another Swiss diplomat here - where is she - Ruth -

01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:06.960
just she's there sitting.

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:13.600
Thank you very much, Shri Mataji. After all the [UNCLEAR] speakers, I hesitate a little bit umm,

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:21.880
I hesitate to talk because I have no expertise neither scientific nor as a matter of fact in sahaja yoga but I have been

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:27.580
fortunate to practice sahaja yoga for about 15 years now and

01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:36.360
what Shri Mataji just mentioned is that [UNCLEAR - INDIAN?] sahaja yoga has been recognized by the

01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:45.220
[UNCLEAR] Council of the United Nation has a comprehensive meditation system which brings

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:50.720
physical, emotional, mental benefits to staff members and is sahaja.

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:57.720
This society is encouraging staff members to meditate according to sahaja yoga's technique

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:05.380
but if I might be a little bit more global and more general than the conversation, the very high level

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:12.960
presentation we have just heard now uh.. I would just like to stress that at the United Nation we are very, very concerned

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:18.680
about the issues of global management or of Mother Earth resources

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:26.160
and in the nineties one of the very rising issues is, going to keep a balance between development and ecology

01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:32.180
between human activities and the resources which allow these activities to

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:39.600
be sustained. You know that water is going to be a very big problem - just drinking water for the billions of people and

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:47.900
in this respect there was a World Bank paper which was saying that, "A long term solution for mankind is only a change in consciousness

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:52.720
so that the human-beings do not have any more the same material demand

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:57.240
Change in consciouness, change in awareness - they hit at that point.

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:03.040
This was a paper of the World Bank on Ecology, on the model of development

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:11.040
which long term can allow all this human-beings to survive on this planet - it's a very serious issue because if you look at the projection

01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:16.440
uh.. no body really knows how to take care of these billions of people who are being born

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:24.300
and the, the solution was a change in consciousness. If people can be in a state of peace,

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:31.180
can be in a state of satisfaction their demand on the material environment automatic is going to drop because a lot

01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:36.600
of what we produce is to meet artificial need, culturally created artificial needs

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:43.940
and the only solution to get into this condition of contented peace

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:52.460
can be brought by a inner transformation. Now the World Bank doesn't know about sahaja yoga yet

01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:59.200
and that's why they said, "This is the only way to get out but we don't know how to bring about this transformation."

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:07.520
So as a, as a staff member of the United Nation, I can see a very direct relevance of

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.960
uh.. sahaja yoga to help us

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:17.720
changing our attitudes if, if we are to leave our children and grandchildren a place we are to live in.

01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:24.400
You have also got the, you have also got meditation center for sahaja yoga in the U.N. now?

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:32.380
- Uh... we, we have this society which has been created as of January in 1990
- That's [UNCLEAR]

01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:35.940
and we hope that

01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:43.460
we start by before we talk about world peace, we hope in good logic we start becoming peaceful

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:51.880
beings ourselves and then there'll be less fight in one floor of the United Nation and the work will be more, more carried more effectively.

01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:59.040
I forgot to present myself. My name is Gregoire de Kalbermatten and I am Chief of Policy Planning and Evaluation in

01:09:59.340 --> 01:10:04.660
United Nation Capital Development Fund which invest projects in the list of developed countries of the world.

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:10.600
Uh... by the Grace of Shri Mataji, I, I

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:18.920
can say from my personal experience that uh... the the practice of sahaja yoga does influence us

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:25.080
in a, in a state of consciousness which correspond to, to the definition of the state that

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:32.160
collectively mankind should reach in order to develop a different type of society.

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:40.080
This is a very general remark but I suppose that it needed to be made because the managers of society today

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:47.480
cannot address anymore the complexities of the challenge that, that are before us and we need this higher level of guidance from inside

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:53.940
that meditation gives us and as Dr. Worlikar said it before,

01:10:54.120 --> 01:11:00.640
before me it is all a matter of enlightened attention because then the solution just present themselves before us

01:11:00.920 --> 01:11:07.520
and no, no amount of efficiency would allow us to get there uh.. where the vibrations of

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:14.060
- sahaja yoga lead us to the right solution spontaneously somehow. Shri Mataji, I think that's all. Thank You!
- Thank you!

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:23.080
Uh.. there's another facet which uh.. one could see, it works in sahaja yoga, is the agriculture.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:31.980
We haven't got Dr. Hamid just now here - he's gone away. I wish he was here because he has experimented with vibrated water.

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:39.340
I have also shown the experiments uh... in Poona that I sowed about 60

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:47.980
kilos of rice in one acre of area and we got about 1400 kilos

01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:55.300
of such beautiful rice that I sent it to the University, at Phule University in Rahuri

01:11:55.580 --> 01:12:02.380
and they said they have never seen such rice. Then they came all the way to see what I was experimenting with and also the

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:08.580
uh.. Sunflower we got was about say two, two feet at least minimum

01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:14.900
and so full of big, big seeds - I mean, they never looked like the seed of the Sunflower and you had to

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:22.720
at least two persons had to lift it, it was so heavy. Now the, here the main thing is that we have not used

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.400
uh.. hybrid seeds because if you use hybrid seeds you get a, you have to

01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:34.800
uh... take them from some organization and sort of can be a enslavement but this is non-hybrid seed, ordinary seeds.

01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:42.060
Once we vibrate them - now this is how we can increase our capacity to produce much more

01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:45.780
much more variety of

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:55.140
crops. Also things like olives, they said will never grow but I have, I have grown that olives, lot of olives I've grown.

01:12:55.380 --> 01:13:01.200
Then they said that tulips will not grow - I've grown them. All kinds of things that they said will never grow in Poona

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:09.460
and they are all growing very nicely. I don't know how they just said it cannot be grown. So all these things can be worked out. This is how a kind of a prosperity

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:17.560
can come to our villages but we have to be pragmatic about it, we have to be serious about it and we have to help

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:25.480
our poor people here. Another problem that always comes up with is, I think, some of the doctors are little upset thinking that

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:33.300
if sahaja yoga comes up what will happen to their practice, so already, I've already told them that I'm not going to work for the rich people

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:39.440
I don't want to work for rich people. They can have the rich people to themselves - I want to work for poor people. In our country

01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:47.720
people don't even have sufficient food to eat, they don't - how will they go for treatment or anything but through sahaja yoga en masse we work it out, en masse.

01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:55.340
Even if there are thousand people in a group or even ten thousand people, most of them will be benefitted by Kundalini awakening

01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:01.120
so why not we try to help the poor who don't have any money and as a saint, I think, every saint has

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:08.520
only concern for the people who are suffering and who are poor, who are downtrodden. You see, the interest is not in the rich people at all

01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:16.340
is, interest is more in the people who need help and this is the help of, I should say, God Almighty

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:22.980
because this is the power of God which is All-pervading, which is very subtle and which starts working through you.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:30.040
Once you are connected, just like you are connected - this instrument is connected to the mains, it starts working, in the same way you start working.

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:37.140
And I would say that the doctors here should also, as other doctors have done it, should come round and see for themselves

01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:44.740
and we have some, as I told you, some Indian doctors working it out in Delhi also we can do it in Bombay - we can help the poor people

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:50.680
uh.. and it will be such a great punya for us to help them because this country, you see, I mean,

01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:58.580
uh.. I don't know, I'm bit too sensitive with, I see this poverty, I just can't even enjoy My sahaja yoga

01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:06.460
because I feel when will they get all these things, they have to have it and if we are concerned about these things, we don't run after superficial things.

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:14.060
Of course I agree that there have been false gurus - I agree that and I would like one person to talk to you about T.M.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:20.380
who was the head of the T.M. in Scotland and who was completely finished with it

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:26.660
so he is here - I've cured many people from T.M., many people from T.M. We have one person here from  T.M. and

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:34.060
uh.. also from Rajneesh - they'll tell you what harm they have done. It's better to see because there is falsehood; There is truth and there is falsehood

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:39.640
but truth can be understood very easily if you know what a saint should be.

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:45.960
The saint has no interest in your money, in your position, in anything; His interest is only in awakening your Kundalini

01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:53.080
and taking you to God, that's all - other interests are not there. So, you see, this is what one should judge any saint of.

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:59.460
You don't know how much these people have gone there and brought such bad name to us specially this Rajneesh has just said one word

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:07.480
the whole lecture was going on, so many things were given to read, in Poona and they just uh.. caught hold of one word, they asked Me, "What about Rajneesh?"

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:15.340
I just said, "She's bilander," I should have said much more. I just said, "He's bilander," so they caught hold of that word and the whole thing started working on that only point

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:21.840
that he's - are we that level that we are mouthpiece of such a man who was thrown out of every country?

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:29.240
If you want to hear about him, I'll ask somebody to talk about him. Horrible, he was arrested and people hate him , in Russia they call him [UNCLEAR - RASPUTIN?]

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:34.640
Such a man who's all the time uh.. changing himself - he thinks he's wise, I think, he's the

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:40.660
he's the most dangerous man you could have. And now his ideas - he wants to insult Ganesha.

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:47.180
Now I must tell you, without Ganapati we cannot cure many diseases because Ganesha is on the Muladhara - we cannot cure

01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:54.240
There are all these doctors they never knew Ganapati, they didn't know what was Ganapati's 'Ga' was but I told them this is Ganapati, you have to

01:16:54.480 --> 01:17:00.840
worship if you want to cure. Even cancer cannot be cured unless we take the help of Ganapati - It's such a pure deity.

01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:07.300
But this gentleman started saying that , "Ganapati comes from the word 'ganika'."

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:13.140
This is his own ideas - you see, such a perverted brain! It comes from the word 'Gana'. 'Gana' means,

01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:20.420
in our medical terminology we can say antibodies - they are antibodies and this is called as smirksing.

01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:24.580
Americans have started a thing called smirks. So these are the antibodies

01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:28.840
and these Ganas are very important - without the antibodies we cannot fight any disease.

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:33.300
Now how to excite them - you have to take the name of the Goddess for this.

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:40.500
You see, all these things are, look so fantastic but, you see, you don't know our, our heritage is fantastic,

01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:48.640
tremendous; We have no ideas to what we are! And if somebody tries to say something these are all half-baked scientists,

01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:55.300
half-baked people who don't know much about it, just try to push you down and you have, must have heard they stoned us.

01:17:55.780 --> 01:18:02.460
Eighty foreigners were hurt by their stoning. They just put us into such a trap and they tortured our lives.

01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:10.620
I mean we, we are very peaceful people, uh.. we didn't do anything. We were about, that time,1200 people, they were only 12 people - these Nirmoolan people.

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:18.080
Anybody, anybody in that place would have really thrashed them but I said, "Nothing doing, you sit down," and everybody got hurt

01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:23.760
but 18 were very badly hurt and some of them got uh.. fractures of the ribs even.

01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:32.660
but nobody stirred out, nobody said anything and the newspapers, I'm surprised, gave absolutely, absolutely the opposite.

01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:40.980
I just don't know and one newspaper correspondent - now you just think of it - what a level we should be in India where we have such a great heritage!

01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:48.340
He brought a paper from this 'Andhashraddha Nirmoolan' - there're hardly some 12 people some students something like that -

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:53.420
he brought and gave it to Me. I was surprised how could a newspaper man give Me that!

01:18:53.700 --> 01:19:01.720
Now they try to play tricks and - now we have given everything so you better go through it and see for yourself how it was just like a mafia of police.

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:07.180
and how they tortured us and what these foreigners are going to speak about us when they go there?

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:13.160
They're going to go to their embassies, no doubt; We have lots of journalists here, of a very high repute, it's all going to be there

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:18.020
that there's a mafia going on in Maharashtra state - is a fact. The way they

01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:21.840
managed the whole thing is so surprising - I cannot imagine!

01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:31.160
We have done no wrong to anyone. They have no right to disturb us, not disturb but to hit us like this for nothing at all - what wrong have we done?

01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:40.340
I have been to so many countries, I must say. I have been to Turkey - we have a representative now; Turkey is a Islamic country

01:19:40.720 --> 01:19:44.880
but the police themselves gave us a number, a code number - they respected us.

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:51.760
Anywhere I go I have never seen such things happening. Especially in Russia - we have representatives from Russia here sitting.

01:19:51.980 --> 01:19:59.780
They come all the way to know how I can help their children. What about people who are living here? Are they not going to use Me; I'm your own - am I not?

01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:08.080
They're not going to use My powers or they're not going to use My knowledge. When these people are using My knowledge in scientific field, in medical field,

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:15.840
in other fields, even in agricultural field - are we just going to get after every person, superficially looking at every person?

01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:23.780
Of course I'm a simple woman, I do not have all these ostentations of a big sadhu baba or something like that,

01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:30.320
I'm a housewife and I'm a simple woman but that doesn't mean that everything that I say is false;

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:35.580
You have to - I, I would request media to now rise up.

01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:42.540
You see, at the time when it was 1942, I was a very young woman and we did fight the British that time

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:49.380
the newspapers were of such a level, I mean, it's a legend, I tell you, it's a legend; They would never support anybody so destructive.

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:55.920
There were hardly twelve people uh.. standing there and shouting and disturbing - every newspaper had their photographs.

01:20:56.600 --> 01:21:03.020
Yesterday at the, here at the Secretariat there were 1200 people

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:10.880
standing silently, such silence, such serenity and such uh..dignity!

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:18.160
You would never find such people together. My husband says, "They're angels, You've found all the angels of the world."

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:25.160
And this is what everybody has to become. We have to transform this world - think of your children what are they going to get?

01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:31.820
We have to transform them, you have to give them sense of security and we have to give them a beautiful uh..

01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:36.960
Kingdom of God, as I call it. So just to deny God is very arrogant, I think.

01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:41.940
Even the greatest scientist like Einstein would not deny that, Newton would not deny that.

01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:48.400
Who are these scientist here, what discoveries have they made? I mean, it's such a

01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:56.280
small-mindedness, it's a such a short-sightedness but what we have great, is our saints.

01:21:57.620 --> 01:22:05.460
They're great saints and they have given so many things to us and thanks to them that I'm working because what they have done, what they have

01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:10.720
uh.. produced that I could reach all the villagers and all the people.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:18.720
Actually in the villages Indians live, I tell you. They're so simple, so sweet and the way they receive Me, the way they get realization,

01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:23.260
the way they have improved their agriculture and everything is wonderful to see them.

01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:31.480
And My work is more in the villages because I must say, from My childhood I've been very much concerned about this great country because this is a yoga bhumi

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:39.920
this is not an ordinary country, you don't know. We have got the Adhyatma with us, we have got the greatest nourishing treasures with us.

01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:48.300
And all these Western countries, which are now suffering because of a one-sided development of science and all that - we have to nourish them,

01:22:48.860 --> 01:22:55.900
we have to. You see, these people are all - there are some people from very high officials from uh.. - what's your company, from

01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:03.560
- IBM
- IBM and we have people from other big companies here - haan, there's another one from uh...

01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:11.420
annh uh... Oliveti - we have big people here. Then we have one Dr. Khan, who is a very well known uh.. scientist

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:19.340
from uh.. Calcutta and all these people are here, so many people are here whom we can point out. There are big business people here

01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:23.640
all of them are here and we have people who have been cured of blood cancer also -

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:33.220
they were declared to be dead. In Poona these people spoke, nobody bothered. What they were - aa jao idhar aa jao. This is a architect; We have two architects

01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:39.260
who were declared to be dead within eight days - they were cured of sahaja yoga - they are here. See now

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:46.580
[ALL CLAP] [UNCLEAR] So all these they spoke

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:53.220
and there was, Mr. Malhotra also told about his angina but the Poona newspapers, I don't know, they have become, just their level is

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:59.180
the mouthpiece of this Rajnish and the whole this all - if you see these people who talk of

01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:05.080
"There's no God and all this is humbug and this and that," are nothing but the ideas of Mr. Rajnish.

01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:11.480
He's penetrating them into our intellectuals and this people and that people and they are accepting it - is a very dangerous thing

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:17.560
and it is coming even into the people who are supposed to be our leaders. It's a very dangerous thing and he's

01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:25.260
thrown out from every country. In Greece he was not even allowed to stay there. I mean, the less said the better. We have people who can talk about it.

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:31.260
Now, I would like you to know about TM, how dangerous it is but nobody has attacked here. Can you tell Peter Pear?

01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:35.940
This is Mr. Peter Pears. He was a diamond merchant and what Mr. TM did to him.

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:44.220
Shri Mataji, ladies and gentleman, my name is Peter Pears, for from

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:49.400
1970 I got initiated into TM.

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:58.120
It cost money. 1972 I became a teacher

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:05.720
of Transcendental Meditation where I met Maharishi and from that time onwards

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:14.400
- somehow I became one of the leaders, international leaders of Transcendental meditation.
- He just mesmerised them absolutely.

01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:21.940
Through, as Mother says, a mesmerisation process

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:29.100
of learning mantras, of teaching mantras in simplistic forms of

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:32.360
'inga', 'aina', 'aima', 'ainga'

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:40.280
we entrapped thousands of individuals

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:50.000
In 1976 I went on another course costing something like twelve thousand pounds.

01:25:53.060 --> 01:26:01.000
I then purchased a place in Scotland for the movement which belonged to myself and my wife

01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:10.000
and over a period of three years they were indebted to me for the tune of a quarter of a million pounds

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:21.080
of fees never paid, always promised and while I was teaching these people

01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:27.100
a number of them eventually landed up in mental institutes.

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:35.540
One particularly known pop star's wife, we with the Grace of Mother, eventually had to

01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:43.220
get after the mental institute where some teacher has said, "Your abstract uh..

01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:48.120
experiences are beyond me, I think you better go and see a psychiatrist."

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:54.780
On seeing the psychiatrist, he did one thing and that was putting him, put her in a mental institute.

01:26:56.220 --> 01:27:03.960
Gradually, my wife and myself became non-communicative -

01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:13.060
unable to relate to the outside what we termed as the outside world -

01:27:14.060 --> 01:27:21.160
became more and more inward bound. My wife went into long periods

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:28.480
- of, what could be called
- A new type of epilepsy
- Catatonia

01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:37.420
- [UNCLEAR]
- for anything upto twelve hours she would sit in a corner
- and scream and shout - horrible!

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:45.880
Umm, in 1979, early in 1979 at the absolute

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:55.520
wit's end, I didn't know which way to turn. I eventually decided that it was the end.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:01.300
I took the movement to court over the monies owed to us.

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:09.080
Unfortunately uh.. the

01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:14.300
liquidates of the company - because when you close down a company in Scotland, you have to liquidate it

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:20.660
they haven't to choose the international, transcendental meditation's international orders

01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:28.120
and I told them that at the time that this happened to be a conflict of interest and I said we're not like that here, we're different

01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:32.100
it doesn't matter, we're dealing with a different case.

01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:39.160
I said, "Fine," anyways nothing to do with you, it's in the hand of the liquidators, it's in the hands of the courts.

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:43.220
- Every money, you see,
- We went to court
- went to people with money.

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:51.840
The High Court judge said, "Stop wasting Mr. Pears' money and go outside and decide on how you're going to pay it back."

01:28:52.660 --> 01:28:56.680
Outside, they wondered whether they were going to

01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:07.860
jeopardise a 150 million dollar a year business, as transcendental meditation is or was in those days,

01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:11.600
infinitely more today

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:19.140
or to pay me 320 thousand pounds, as was owed

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:26.560
and they decided, for their own skins, to drop the case.

01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:34.580
They went back in again and said, "We have just dropped the case," and that was the end of it and I lost 320 thousand pounds then.

01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:40.140
And not many people, especially myself could take, are not like that.

01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:47.900
Linda was unbelievably uh.. defected.

01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:56.680
We happened to meet a very well known Neuro-physiologist in London from St.Thomas'

01:29:57.640 --> 01:30:05.440
and he was interested in doing experiments on us and with another smaller group of meditators

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:11.880
who had done these obscure techniques of hopping around like a frog on the ground

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:22.300
umm, he eventually has a look at the uh.. brain waves patterns

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:26.100
and he said, "You know, these are those of an epileptic."

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:36.500
And here was the movement he was thinking that these brain waves patterns showed

01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:40.400
the correlation of integration

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:49.520
and they purport to be scientists, you know have all the scientific data, showing how good it was and so on and so forth

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:55.240
and here is a well-known Physiologist saying the complete opposite.

01:30:56.680 --> 01:31:01.600
And by the Grace of another friend of mine I happened to meet Shri Mataji

01:31:02.980 --> 01:31:07.560
and in a very short time we were cured.

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:16.240
Shri Mataji had me stay with Her for six months and never once that I spent or have to spend

01:31:17.780 --> 01:31:25.600
never once did I - because we can all, all sahaja yogis can give realization to people.

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:30.760
Never once did we have to pay one penny.

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:37.960
[CLAPPING]

01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:45.080
And you know a quarter of a million in 1979 was a lot of money and we couldn't believe

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:54.920
and none of the others, who we managed to drag out of Transcendental meditation, could believe,

01:31:55.200 --> 01:32:00.120
here we had something which was tangible, something we could actually feel -

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:06.760
not only could we feel ourselves but we could feel those around us, we could feel their chakras.

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:14.640
Transcendental meditation is nothing. You can't feel a thing - all you can feel is your gradual

01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:20.180
inward, recluse type attitude

01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:29.020
and with the blessings of Mother and with you people writing

01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:38.280
the facts in your newspapers maybe we can rescue many, many more

01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:45.960
people in India. Thank You, Mother! [CLAPPING]

01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:51.020
Uh.. I must say that uh.. so many are really lost,

01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:58.980
I tell you, in a very bad shape, I mean, I used to really weep seeing that they have become absolutely like mental

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:06.440
cases and in a very bad shape. Also Rajnish's things are just the same. Uh... we have had

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:13.360
experiences of Rajnish's people coming to My program and Yogi Mahajan was quite

01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:18.880
sort of sympathetic about them. He told Me, "There are three Rajnish's people who are very much

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:26.320
uh.. in trouble Mother, should I bring them to the program?" I said, "Please don't. You can bring them home but not there. It'll be dangerous."

01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:33.500
And he just brought them because they forced him and they brought them. And they were about 100 ft away from Me. As soon as they saw Me

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:42.120
they just fell like, fell down and became just like stones, just like stones. Nobody could lift them they were so heavy. I mean, they had to really

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:49.540
like move the stones outside and it was terrible. Then some people went to, there's an ashram he has got

01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:57.740
in Dharamshala - they said, "We want to have a kind of a, sort of a cure for our uh..

01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:05.340
troubles and all." He said, "No, no you better go to Shri Mataji. I will not allow you to come to this place." So they said, "Why not?"

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:13.520
So they - he said, "Alright, you come along," and he said, "You put your hands towards Shri Mataji." They started shaking, the whole body started shaking - then I left.

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:23.720
But then of course, I mean, you know as it is I'm too compassionate for all this, I feel so terrible. We had - have you got Robert here also [UNCLEAR] - did he come? Haan

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:31.540
We have two persons from where - this is Robert, who suffered a lot and the sahaja yogis objected he's coming to our ashram

01:34:31.820 --> 01:34:38.640
so I stayed in the ashram Myself, kept him there, looked after him and he got completely cured of

01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:46.720
such bad [UNCLEAR]. He would have been finished by now in the lunatic asylum or something. Not only that but now you got what degree?

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:54.100
- Now [INAUDIBLE]
- What degree you have got? [UNCLEAR]

01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:58.040
It is by the Grace of Shri Mataji that I am standing here, as She told

01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:05.500
and also that I have achieved last year the degree of Art History, that means not a doctor yet -

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:10.140
maybe once it will happen by Mother's Grace but

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:17.520
before doctor I don't know how this is called in English doctor [UNCLEAR]. I've been doing this study [UNCLEAR] in Belgium

01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:23.640
from 1982 on. In 1981 I received my realization from Her.

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:31.340
I met Shri Mataji luckily in Paris because I was hopelessly seeking there the Truth

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:38.440
and actually I was be-fooled by this Rajnish because with his books on the markets,

01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:46.480
which he writes for making money of course and also he uh.. abuses

01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:53.100
the [UNCLEAR - AFFECTED?] seekers - ones who have overcome their problems. He doesn't give the solution

01:35:53.540 --> 01:36:00.080
by effect, like Shri Mataji does, the effect of realization but he first writes these books

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:08.620
so that these get sold, then little by little he gives programs or therapies for which has to be paid a lot

01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:16.700
like, one of the therapies is they call re-birthing and for this you have to pay 30$ per hour

01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:23.840
and this is a kind of injection of oxygen which you put in your lungs, you breathe

01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:31.720
during an hour in an unnatural way. This gives a very funny affect your muscles

01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:39.940
uh.. and it gives a kind of a purification, maybe, because of the oxygen which burns away problems

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:48.620
but it not a lasting curing - the problems come back which means you have to come back to this center

01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:57.280
to get this therapy again so it gives you an enslavement to this therapy and you pay everytime

01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:04.720
these 30$. So, I was a student, I had very little money but I lost even what I had

01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:08.620
uh.. with these techniques - sorry.

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:16.280
Other things, horrible things which, which this Rajnish teaches is the called the Kundalini dance.

01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:23.920
Mother please forgive me but this is a terrible dance and they jump

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:29.240
and shout like dogs and fall on their heels - you have to jump.

01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:36.960
And can you imagine, if you look out on the chart which you have on your papers, you see that the heel is the Muladhara chakra

01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:43.440
so he shocks the whole body through this method and he makes a big [UNCLEAR] out of it

01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:50.740
so that you don't feel the subtleties any more of the real uh... later on of the real Kundalini.

01:37:54.140 --> 01:38:02.140
Actually years later you still can suffer from these shocks you have experienced in your body, like headaches

01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:06.880
- or tensions
- Very much
- in the chakras and

01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:13.180
and there are actually, Shri Mataji told that there are very few persons who overcame this.

01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:20.060
- It's true. 
- this
- Rahnish's people I could not cure many. You see,  they're so absolutely doomed

01:38:20.740 --> 01:38:28.320
doomed people, you cannot and he himself is suffering now so much and they say he's so wise this, that - I just don't know what sort of a

01:38:28.540 --> 01:38:36.040
wisdom is this, what sort of. He reads books, you see, he has lots of books - those who have not uh.. people who are not well read can easily see these are,

01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:41.920
this is he has taken from this book, that book but he just publishes it that's how he has published books and he has made money

01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:50.280
but the worst part is that the way he has made these people suffer, the way he has made them suffer but not one, so many of them

01:38:51.020 --> 01:38:57.400
and you'll be surprised, his name is so bad everywhere, I mean, now there's one thing we have got for him

01:38:57.900 --> 01:39:03.920
which you could not got say anywhere, the special one I've arranged in this private place, for you to see a film

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:11.480
which was done by an Englishman who came here and he made a hole and took all these photographs of his mass

01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:19.240
sex act - of course, I don't want to see it because once I saw, I vomited for eight days so the what he has done and how he has ruined people

01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:24.160
for going to this he used to charge five hundred rupees, for going to this nonsensical things.

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:31.900
Even those who have not gone to this, have been too much affected  - this is what he started but then the AIDS came in

01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:35.640
so the AIDS came in and his disciples started getting AIDS so he changed over.

01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:43.540
He's done all kinds of tricks, all kinds of things and all the manipulations and everything and that's what is now coming into our uh..

01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:50.400
people who are our leaders - it's coming into them, they're, they're taking from them. He's teaching them all these ways and methods of these things.

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:57.700
and I don't know, there was a case I heard about that there was a case [UNCLEAR] that he has taken away this land from somebody

01:39:57.940 --> 01:40:03.380
and it land doesn't belong to him but the whole case was suppressed then, completely suppressed - I just don't understand.

01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:07.960
It's like a, you just don't understand how such things can happen?

01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:15.260
Because I have lived now in U.K. and any other countries of the, I mean, such horrible things do not happen like this - anybody

01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:22.000
cannot get on with every sort of a nonsense that's why he's here, I think, otherwise he cannot exist in any other country.

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:28.940
Illegal things, so many illegal things they're done. In our case, especially I would say, they were first shouting, alright.

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:34.160
Then they said all kinds of things against Me. Now to hear something against your Mother, is very difficult.

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:40.180
If you abuse somebody's Mother - but I told them not to get irritated, not to get angry. Then

01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:47.000
they disturbed us - is illegal to disturb any meeting. You can shout when there's no meeting but when I started

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:54.380
the police was just standing there, doing nothing. Then we went to, they wrote to Me another letter saying that, "Alright,

01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:59.700
we, we would like You to tell us about sahaja yoga and we'll try to uh.. help You

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:05.880
and we'll of course add to Your success and to Your uh...

01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:12.640
[UNCLEAR] annh.. fame, to Your fame. They wrote a letter to Me signed, you know

01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:18.120
and we took it for granted. When we went to Satara they had called the, they had called the police

01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:24.060
and there were people shouting again all kinds of dirty things against Me, all kinds of - it was unbearable. You see,

01:41:24.260 --> 01:41:31.480
Indians and the foreigners when they heard the meaning, they all were boiling with temper. I said, "Alright, doesn't matter you can later on have

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:38.860
a kind of a vidarshan or something, you can take out your temper there but just now you bear it."

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:46.060
Now after that we had to tell the police that two and a half hours we could not start our meeting that you ask them to stop now.

01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:53.240
So otherwise it's illegal then the police stopped but in this place Sangapur it was so horrible

01:41:53.460 --> 01:42:00.840
that no police came. We had told them that you have to come here - no police came, nobody came and they left us in the lurch

01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:08.260
and they put us into a, a kind of a compound, behind was a bus depot.

01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:16.240
And these people came from behind and took some ladders from the timber mart and put them - it's really a mafia, I tell you

01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:23.540
and started throwing stones indiscriminately. Two boys were hit by - [UNCLEAR] I didn't see them hitting these two persons -

01:42:23.700 --> 01:42:30.000
was one Dr. Dabolkar and other fellow Mr. Pangi. They hit him and they gave, sort of, signals to them

01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:37.280
The other people started shouting from there in the dark so these boys went that side to see who is shouting. They hit them so hard.

01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:42.180
Somebody got hurt here - all of them are foreigners who got very badly hurt, eighteen of them.

01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:46.480
- Where it happened?
- Annh? Angapur. Now you know where is Angapur
- Angapur?

01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:52.960
Angapur. You see, it is, it is from Satapur, Satara far away - it's a very remote place.

01:42:53.220 --> 01:43:01.280
Angapur why I go because Shri Ramadasa formed the statue of Shri Rama and Sita and also of Anglai devi

01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:08.720
so it's a very, very powerful place so I went there and we were having - I've been there going for six years

01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:15.180
and the Ramasthas, poor things, were involved and the newspaper, I gave absolutely a wrong information.

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:23.100
When these people went to the police station, you'll be surprised, the Sakar people rang up at 10:30 in the night to find out if -

01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:28.760
in Marathi was [MARATHI]

01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:36.520
Then he told the right thing, "No it was much worse, they were hit and they put the stones and all that."

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:41.500
But in paper just the opposite - I just don't know how can they do it?

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:50.200
And they went to the police later on to put their uh..case and police said, "Have you got any injuries?" They said, "No, no not much but

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:58.120
you see, this they beat us." All wrong, absolutely wrong but you'll be surprised there was a Doordarshan man with them who came

01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:06.600
and he jumped on the stage. Can you imagine, this is a mafia stuff. I was about to speak, he jumps on the stage and he says, "Mataji, I must have your interview."

01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:13.380
I said, "But this not the time. You were to come at 6 0'clock why have you come now, I have to speak now." "No, no you must give."

01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:21.320
Imagine a Doordarshan man is a government servant, why should he and why should Doordarshan be there, I can't understand ? No policeman only Doordarshan man.

01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:26.540
And this vaartahaar, the correspondent from there, he was there but he ran away

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:35.020
and this one Mr. Pange, who was a Jila something, Sahakari Bank something, so he had thrown the stones so they brought him to the stage

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:42.080
I said, "I agree, he has thrown the stones," and here it hurt a boy and it

01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:48.820
gave him a fracture, he started bleeding, we had to send him to the hospital - still it is to be operated on and something has to be done.

01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:54.900
Now, when they brought him, you see, I was very quiet and I said, "Now have peace, we have to show we are peaceful people.

01:44:55.400 --> 01:45:01.940
Peace itself has power, now don't shout, don't beat anyone, don't do anything." They brought him there and I said, "Now you take him to the police station.

01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:09.620
I will not allow you to touch him even on anything, you just take him." So what they said, "They tied it up us and all," - how can

01:45:09.900 --> 01:45:16.200
we lie so much in this country. I mean, lies of the worst type, I can tell you. How can we do it?

01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:26.220
I understand newspaper has to give both the sides but this is just lie and this Sakaar paper has been telling always lies against Me.

01:45:26.480 --> 01:45:33.980
This I built a house, I didn't know that they had intention of having a buildings there - they wanted to have buildings for the builders

01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:41.100
you see, as if they've become agents of builders. So these people got after Me, I didn't know that this land belonged to them or anything

01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:47.780
I just built My own farmhouse because I'm interested in farming so they got after Me and they got a

01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:55.220
proper nine people's arrangement made from Collector, Commissioner and even the judge

01:45:55.460 --> 01:46:00.140
who had, District judge who had retired so they put an ad hoc judge there

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:06.800
and passed an ex-party demolition of My house My husband's hard earned money - ex-party

01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:14.980
and luckily I came here to, to Bombay next day and the judge said, "How can it be?" You were so status quo and gave Me a state

01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:21.200
order and he squashed the whole thing. He said, "You're so illegal. She has taken permissions from Gram Panchayat, from everyone,

01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:28.700
She has got everything, map and everything intact. And My husband has got doctorate from India and also from England

01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:35.840
in law and I showed him. And he, they said, "How could you do these things?" And this is what Sakaar paper did was to write. Then

01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:42.480
of course our sahaja yogis could not bear it so they wrote to the Press that the way they wrote all nonsensical things about, you see, alleging Me

01:46:42.700 --> 01:46:48.960
that I'm doing all illegal things so the Press Council was very nice and they sent Me a message

01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:54.340
that, "We have decided that You can ask these people

01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:59.780
to give You a public apology and whatever You write they have to publish."

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:07.940
But you know I'm very forgiving, I said , "Forget it now what's there to apologise - whatever is done, is done," but they're again back in the seat.

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:14.780
I don't know what's wrong with this Prataprao Pawar also, why is he, why is he  - I mean,  just as if, you see, they have become like

01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:19.920
uh... Lords of the whole world, they survey - they can do what they like and beating these foreigners -

01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:27.860
they are now going to go to their embassies and going to go to the whole world - the way they have behaved. It is nowhere done like this.

01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:34.260
and they're supporting this Andhashradha Nirmoolan Samiti. I've got the name of Prataprao Pawar on nthe committee there.

01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:44.700
I mean, this is even worse than mafia. I've been to Sicily, I've been to all places - I've never seen such a thing happening.

01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:54.260
And the police, you know, the police was so cunning at 9 0'clock they came and this policeman says that,

01:47:54.560 --> 01:48:01.940
"Now you uh.. finish your meeting." I said, "Meeting is already finished but I can't take them out because they are there

01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:08.820
and they will just trouble these people so we will first of all see that these people go away." He said, "Alright, they have gone." I couldn't take him

01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:16.920
because I knew they were all very mischievous people so I asked one gentleman Dayal to go and see for himself. He came back, he was hit here, he had a big lump

01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:23.840
on his, they had beaten him up here and his nose was bleeding. I said,

01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:27.960
"What is this, how can I send this foreigners by that road where people are beaten up?"

01:48:28.620 --> 01:48:34.620
So, he said, "No, no they are gone." I said, "Nothing doing, you remove them other wise I will never allow these people to go."

01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:42.220
Then I sent some other people to see. Till 12:30 we were there, in the night - imagine - just sitting there -we couldn't move.

01:48:42.500 --> 01:48:47.820
Then they told that have put already the stones on the road and they're going to stop the buses and they're going to hit these people.

01:48:48.540 --> 01:48:56.560
Same with this Vigyan Prabodhini, supposed to be nonsensical thing like that. You see, this Icchal Karanji place we went to long time back about

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:03.620
'80 - '81 and they were alright when I was talking and suddenly when these foreigners were getting into the bus

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:11.500
they took hockey sticks and big, big sticks started hitting them. They all got so badly hurt but that time, I must say, Shankara Chauhan was there

01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:19.080
and I went and talked to Sidhu and Sidhu immediately ordered an enquiry and he really took them to task - but that's a different thing.

01:49:20.140 --> 01:49:27.220
This I can't understand what's happening? If this kind of a, I mean, we have

01:49:27.860 --> 01:49:35.240
security no body can move. In a place like Gangapur, to reach there itself is difficult and this Doordarshan fellow was there.

01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:43.740
and he jumped on the stage. Why, what right has he got to ask Me, just tell Me? I mean, you may be newspaper people, alright, but

01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:49.500
everybody has their own limitations, isn't it? You cannot jump on the stage and ask Me questions at that time.

01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:55.340
And the Vaartahaar himself gave Me the papers from these people. I mean, just I can't imagine!

01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:07.160
Isn't it a shameful thing that the foreigners were here - they are saintly people and very badly hurt, very badly hurt..

01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:12.100
- Tell us something about sahaja yoga
- Annh?
- when it started, how it started?
- Alright.

01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:19.240
Sahaja yoga, as he has told you, is, is this is not a new thing. Sahaja yoga has been used

01:50:19.900 --> 01:50:26.000
since long in this country - it's our heritage, has been used. Sahaja, 'Sa' is with, 'Ja' is born with you

01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:32.620
and it is something uh.. which has been already used by our saints

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:36.560
but very few people got realization, very few people got realization

01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:43.940
and then it so happened that when, I mean, when I was born I knew I had to do this

01:50:44.380 --> 01:50:52.040
work of  Collective uh.. Realization - I had to work it out and My father himself was a very saintly person and a

01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:59.160
very sacrificing person; My mother was also and they wanted Me to find out the ways and method how I would achieve

01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:05.400
a saamoohik chetna uh... for the people because that is - you see, they were also very concerned about

01:51:05.580 --> 01:51:12.180
the people. They sacrificed all their life for Congress and this and, I mean, I also, as they told you, I,

01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:17.640
I've also suffered a lot. They gave Me electric shocks and all that - doesn't matter - but after that

01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:24.740
all that when Gandhiji was there also Gandhiji knew all about it and if Gandhiji had lived he would have supported Me -

01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:32.040
he would definitely have supported Me - mean, he was a realized soul, Shastriji was also a realized soul. He used to respect Me so much that

01:51:32.300 --> 01:51:38.780
even when he was a Prime Minister if I came to know, he came to know I was there, he would invite Me. My husband was his secretary, alright

01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:44.580
but to respect Me so much, he would even come to the, come to the uh...

01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:49.940
My car and open the door for Me and saw that - I mean it's so humble towards Me

01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:57.180
because he knew that I had this power in Me. He was after Me that I should take to Congress and this and that but I was just waiting

01:51:57.480 --> 01:52:02.080
to find out a way by which I could break this seventh chakra and all

01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:06.300
and I was studying in My own subtle ways

01:52:06.580 --> 01:52:13.280
the problems of human-beings why they don't get realization. There are problems in these chakras these permutations and combinations

01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:18.960
and in that study and all that, I found, that I'm just about to finish it off

01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:25.960
and I went to many saints, real saints also, to artificial saints and to people like this. I went to

01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:34.220
even the Muktanand I went to, I went to Rajnish and to all those people to find out but Rajnish himself is something surprising

01:52:34.420 --> 01:52:40.340
that first time I met him in Jabalpur because he knew My niece and he said that, "Your

01:52:40.600 --> 01:52:47.460
aunt has come, I would like to meet Her," because My husband was a big man those days so, maybe, he wanted to meet Me or whatever it is

01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:53.200
but as soon as he saw Me, he stretched himself before Me - My brother was also with Me and said, "You are Adishakti, You are Adishakti,"

01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:58.280
so I put up a show I said, "What is You Adishakti, I don't know - what is this, what are you talking about?"

01:52:58.600 --> 01:53:04.700
He said, "You don't know anything about this?" I said, "No, no I don't know anything." So he wanted to get something done, you see, from

01:53:04.960 --> 01:53:11.460
Shastriji. I said, "Nothing doing, I'm sorry, I'm no good for all these things. If you want, you can take an appointment with Shastriji."

01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:16.780
Shastriji never gave an appointment, "Mera dimaag kharaab hai?" he used to say like that. So it happened.

01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:22.660
Then when I came to Bombay again he got after Me. We had an Impala car from Shipping Corporation and wanted to buy that.

01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:29.820
His attention was only on money or this. He was saying - I had a kada with Me.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:36.560
"Why don't You give me this kada?" I said, "Why, this is given to Me by My family people, why do you want to have? You are a man what will you do with the kada?"

01:53:36.780 --> 01:53:43.080
He said, "I'll make money out of it." "But why do you want to make money, you are a sadhu, you are a sanyasi?" I couldn't understand him throughout.

01:53:43.340 --> 01:53:50.100
Then he said, "No, no but I'm doing lot of work You don't know and You must come and see Me this." One day he asked Me to go to his lecture

01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:56.960
and he was, I mean, he used to telephone Me too much so My husband said, "It is so much better go what is the harm after all." Went there to his lecture

01:53:58.940 --> 01:54:06.260
so he said, "You sit on the dais." In the presence of everybody if somebody goes on saying, "Sit on the dais," so I said, "Alright," I went and sat. Immediately somebody took My photograph.

01:54:06.820 --> 01:54:12.660
It's a blackmailing system you know, he took My photograph. Then we went to, he said, "You come to Nargol,"

01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:19.620
and he telephoned to Me so many times - My husband said, "I have a friend there nearby, You go and stay there after all You can go and see this man

01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:22.820
what he's doing after all he's saying, maybe, there is some truth in it."

01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:29.460
I said, "Alright baba." Now My husband I didn't know what to tell him about this man that I didn't think much of him. Then I went there.

01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:36.260
I went and I saw the way he was mesmerizing people. They were all fainting, rolling on the... I was so disgusted with them.

01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:43.660
that was on the 4th of May 1970 - the 5th of May this I broke this seventh chakra - that's the thing I broke.

01:54:43.900 --> 01:54:50.320
He doesn't know a word about Kundalini, he doesn't know anything, anything. He doesn't know any medical, he doesn't know any science,

01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:56.520
he doesn't know about our Indian music, he doesn't know about Western music - he is a, he's not at all knowledgeable,

01:54:57.420 --> 01:55:03.580
not at all knowledgeable. He eats like a glutton - I saw him eating, I said, "Baba what is this? Some rakshasa eating food like that."

01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:09.580
I'm telling you the truth, you see, and then he got diabetes, this, that; He's ten years younger to Me

01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:16.340
and he is now lying sick. He is a uh... thrown out of all these places.

01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:23.600
Now explanation he's very good at giving. He says because of Pope he was thrown out - not at all because America doesn't follow Pope;

01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:31.700
They're all Protestant countries who threw him out. He didn't go to any uh.. South American countries where I go and I talk about the wrongs

01:55:31.900 --> 01:55:36.740
of Christianity, wrongs of Hinduism, wrongs of all the religions, of the Islam and everything

01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:41.600
and I tell them that what is written in the Bible, what is written in the ... Koran also they have described sahaja yoga.

01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:48.980
They have said it that, "At the time of resurrection your hands will speak." Clearly it is said. So, you see, if you talk to these people,

01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:54.620
if they're not fundamentalists, they listen to you and it works otherwise how can I work in Turkey and places like that.

01:55:54.980 --> 01:56:00.900
And we have in Algeria so many scientist, aeronautical engineers - so many people there.

01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:06.900
So it's such a unique thing you have got. Now, I would request you to put forward these things for people

01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:14.460
Actually there was no need also for Me to advertise because, you will see that wherever I go I - in Delhi there are at least 10000 people,

01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:20.700
in NOIDA there were 14000 people, in the villages they come from all over. Even for this thing, poor things, had come

01:56:20.860 --> 01:56:25.040
on their bullock-carts and all that and everybody was hit, everyone was hit

01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:32.840
because there were about 400 stones - they threw such big, big stones and the stones were there already. They had everything nicely done because

01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:39.140
they had these ladders and they had those stones for the road building and they threw them.

01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:46.540
- Do You have any guru [UNCLEAR]?
- I have no guru. There is no guru needed for Me. You see, I was born like this

01:56:47.140 --> 01:56:53.920
Everybody - a guru's guru's guru who will be? It's like that. So, you see, I'm an ancient person

01:56:54.740 --> 01:57:02.680
and to know Me it's better that you come to sahaja yoga and then you know Me because, see now, Christ said, "I'm the Son, I'm the only Son of God," - it's a fact.

01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:10.980
Actually Christ is the incarnation of Ganesha - we can prove it, we can prove all these things on vibration. If you get your realization, we can prove everything.

01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:17.540
We can prove the existence of God, we can prove the existence of what we're saying - everything that I say we can prove it on vibrations.

01:57:17.980 --> 01:57:22.580
Supposing I say the truth, then you start getting the cool breeze much more

01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:27.840
but if there's something, somebody's a false guru, false man, you put your hand it'll start burning.

01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:35.940
You diagnose only on your finger-tips, on your finger-tips you can diagnose and that's how all these, after all these are all such

01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:43.160
highly qualified doctors and things and scientists. They themselves have experienced and they are experimenting

01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:50.640
and also to say that I take money and - there's no need because My husband earns quite a lot and by God's Grace he's a very generous man

01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:56.200
and he feels that I'm doing a very good work so he's helping Me. But one side are these false gurus

01:57:56.380 --> 01:58:01.640
and the people who suffer from Andhashraddha where I tell them that don't God,

01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:07.960
they say that Devi comes in the body - I say, "No, nothing of the kind," so they're on one side, another side are these people.

01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:11.440
I just don't know. In India it's this problem - nowhere

01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:20.560
How can Russians - imagine? There was no religion for Russians so far - isn't it? They had no religion but imagine how they jumped into sahaja yoga!

01:58:21.940 --> 01:58:27.440
- You don't have any center in Bombay?
- We have so many
- In Bombay?
- Oh! so many.

01:58:27.820 --> 01:58:34.040
-  [MARATHI]

01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:38.940
[SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS IN MARATHI]

01:58:44.300 --> 01:58:50.540
Now, you must sometimes put the positive side and such a hope for young people, such a hope for our children!

01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:58.980
- You must see the utility of this. You see this I, we are not politicians, we have nothing to do with politics.
- Where we can see this sahaja yoga?

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:05.220
Haan, we centers at Dadar on every Thursday at 6:30, Saane Guruji Vidyalaya

01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:08.960
behind Catering College, we are there and

01:59:09.700 --> 01:59:13.820
we would all invite you there, please come there. That's our main center.

01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:20.200
You go and see, you go and see and get your realization. Unless and until you get your realization

01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:27.820
- We are having at Bhartiya Vidya Bhawan
- You see, like this television is here - unless and until you put to the mains it doesn't work so you don't have to pay anything,

01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:34.840
nothing will go wrong with you on the contrary if you have any problems, they'll be solved so why not take to your realization - this is your own.

01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:38.340
You see, just like one enlightened light can enlighten you.

01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:46.200
We have a, we have a correspondent who came with a skeptical mind - he got realization, he's alright now.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:52.840
[INAUDIBLE]

01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:59.340
They can give realization, you can give realization. Now I don't do it, you see, I don't cure people.

01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:06.480
but these people are demanding, "You must show us, You must give us proof." What right have they got? Alright, I said, " Alright, I will show you,

02:00:06.900 --> 02:00:12.960
I will do it." I did promise everything but this is not the way - now they will not allow Me to touch them.

02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:16.480
Yeh to khonchipana hai na?

02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:27.980
And the police plays into their hands, the police, the entire - even doctor, you'll be surprised, they would not give us

02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:35.320
the certificate of the doctor there. Three days they had to struggle. Then I took them to Kolhapur and Kolhapur, the Mission hospital was shocked

02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:42.640
at the condition and they gave all the certificates to us. Everybody is [UNCLEAR - GLABBING?] hand and two people have been demoted

02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:50.540
- one in [UNCLEAR - FUNDARAIYA?] school, another one they have been demoted and police is after these people, who are innocent people. They're with Me throughout.

02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:57.500
- What is this going on?
- Why You have selected Satara?
- Annh?
- Are You a selected Satara?

02:00:57.740 --> 02:01:03.360
No, you see, Satara we have - actually on our way to Brahmapuri we went to Satara.

02:01:03.740 --> 02:01:11.560
We've been there for the last seven years to Satara and in that place we have been because it's a Ramdasa's place you know that very well;

02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:18.960
It's a specially blessed place and Satara people are very nice that way and they showed us also

02:01:19.180 --> 02:01:25.300
this Mallakhamb, Leghim, everything - they respected us very well always. So this time these were only

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:31.280
16 or 17 people only and at

02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:38.040
Angapur they were, they were saying so that there were 12 people and 4 or 5 were standing outside

02:01:38.340 --> 02:01:43.580
with a three cars. One was a Maruti, another one was

02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:48.340
a Ambassador and one was some jeep, some sort of a thing. I mean this is

02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:56.240
this is called as Andhashraddha Nirmulan? I am the one who has been talking about it since the year 1970.

02:01:56.460 --> 02:02:04.160
I've told them, "This is andhashraddha you cannot do it, this is andhashraddha, this is, what is Swayambhu what is not Swayambhu.

02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:10.220
Even about Christianity I told them what is andhashraddha. I told about Paul so many things against him

02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:17.200
and when the Archbishop of Canterbury's advisor was in My  program and I said everything very clearly, at that day I don't know why

02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:23.600
he was there and I said it against Paul, the way he has spoiled Christianity and he was shocked but nobody did this to Me,

02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:32.220
nobody did this to Me. Moreover, you see, now we are recognised as a religion, as a Federal religion, in America

02:02:32.460 --> 02:02:40.320
as a Federal religion. Then also we are recognised in, uh.. in Russia as an independent

02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:47.960
organisation. In Italy they wrote a book about Me saying, calling Me 'The Person of The Year'

02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:55.100
and they sent their people for televising and they must have televised the whole thing - they were with us. The government sent it.

02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:03.140
Of course, I don't expect this government - but this is not the way to get after us - for what?

02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:17.760
and if this kind of thing is going to work, you see, this is Rajnish style work - it's all manipulation. He did the same style of things

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:25.960
in that Rajnishpuram. If you want to know some Americans can tell you all details about but, I think, I would go away now you better see this film

02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:33.700
This is a very unique film which was purchased by Mr. Rajnish and he's not allowed to show in any public place that's why we arranged this place

02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:39.940
but you better have a look. I better go away I can't bear it, it's too much, it's too much of it! My sensitivity...

02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:47.340
Have you all seen it or not? Hain, dekha? Put yourself into bandhan and see. I don't know, I better go - Mere bas ka nahin.

02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:54.420
- [UNCLEAR] Mataji, tell us something about ...
- About what?
- [UNCLEAR] U.N.
- U.N.?

02:03:54.680 --> 02:04:00.560
- United Nations Organisation
- Kya bataein? Nahin, uspe ek Mera
- [UNCLEAR]

02:04:00.780 --> 02:04:08.500
Nahin, Maine ek, I've, I gave a lecture which was relayed in Australia about para-modernism, about para-modernism

02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:16.620
how by the recession, by the, by the behaviour of the Russian policy, that we are now,

02:04:17.140 --> 02:04:23.580
we are now finished, we are now finished as far as the political problems have concerned

02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:30.540
quite a lot because you see one side is gone  - you clap with both the hands and the one hand is gone like

02:04:30.760 --> 02:04:37.680
Gorbachev was really, definitely, objectively and sincerely has shown his interest in

02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:43.260
all kinds of military thing to establish peace so now Americans have to do something about it -

02:04:43.820 --> 02:04:49.240
so that problem is over but also UN has another problem is Fundamentalism.

02:04:49.460 --> 02:04:56.220
Then we have got another problem is of, as he told you, of the ecological,

02:04:56.720 --> 02:05:04.240
ecological imbalances. Now, ecological imbalances, as he said, has will only come when there's a transformation of human-beings and the awareness

02:05:04.480 --> 02:05:10.860
that of course, you can only achieve through sahaja yoga but also you'll be amazed that - Dr. Hamid is not here but

02:05:11.060 --> 02:05:18.260
he was asked by his government - he was a, I think, was an Advisor in Agriculture in some country by the UN

02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:24.960
but later on now he's working in Austria and the Austrian government requested him to help the trees

02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:31.980
because they were dying out with acid rain so he took vibrated water and put it

02:05:32.760 --> 02:05:38.740
to these trees and he came and told Me, "Mother, 60 years old trees have died away

02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:47.180
but all the rest have come up and they are doing all right." So they have, they have developed such [UNCLEAR - TREG?]  that they can even fight the acid rain also.

02:05:49.160 --> 02:05:54.980
So ecological problems can be solved. Also ecological problems come in because you see the

02:05:55.820 --> 02:06:03.860
people go to extremes - like machines are for us we are not for machines but you go on like mad creating machines.

02:06:04.460 --> 02:06:10.280
Now, they were going to, also this government wanted to have some - the other day when I was in Ganapatipule all these poor

02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:16.920
villagers came, especially these people who are fisherman, they said, "You must do something for us we pray to You." I said, "What has happened?"

02:06:17.340 --> 02:06:23.400
They are going to get all the toxic things from all over the world, all the waste matter and they are going to make something out of it

02:06:23.580 --> 02:06:30.680
on the shores of uh.. Ganpatipule, near Jaigarh, so all the fishes will be dead, no doubt

02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:37.840
and if there's a leakage, all the people can be finished. So why to do such a thing, what is the need? You see, there are so many other things one can do

02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:45.540
to improve the conditions of our people and constructively we should work. Now, I have in My small way

02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:53.380
have thought of so many ways by which we can work out so many things and we have already started

02:06:53.700 --> 02:07:01.560
a center for the women, for the downtrodden in the villages, to teach them certain things how uh..

02:07:02.260 --> 02:07:07.060
collectively they can work out ceramics and things like that

02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:13.480
because it is done by some middlemen always and the middlemen take all the money, they suffer.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:21.520
Now, then I'm thinking of asking people near My place to grow lots of flowers and we can have a

02:07:21.740 --> 02:07:27.900
negotiation with Japan, who want to buy the flowers so they can bring their aeroplanes. If we're not middlemen between

02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:35.940
they'll get all the profits and they'll become alright. See like that you can do so many things in our country but the middlemen, the greedy people

02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:44.140
they kill them but sahaja yogis are not like that. They're honest people, they, they don't take any money like that - we, we have no embezzlement, nothing.

02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:47.680
We are very, very honest and law-abiding people.

02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:55.820
- Do You need money for all these activities or not?
- No, you see activities, of course, we do need but what happens that now, for example, I've come here

02:07:56.060 --> 02:08:02.500
so My husband pays for My ticket to come to India - after all he's very highly paid and we have no expenses as such

02:08:02.700 --> 02:08:09.840
but otherwise, the expenses now for example, hiring a hall or something, so they collect some money among themselves - now we have so many sahaja yogis.

02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:16.260
In the beginning for about four, five years I was paying for everything to begin with even for the people,

02:08:16.420 --> 02:08:23.260
their food and everything, I used to pay because you know, My husband is a very generous man and he believes that what work I'm doing is very good.

02:08:23.500 --> 02:08:31.420
so I used to pay quite a .... I had to sell My ornaments also, My family ornaments - I did it - but now, you see, the thing is that uh..

02:08:31.780 --> 02:08:39.060
now they are so many and they want that for the programs and all that they are but for realization you cannot pay - I don't take any money.

02:08:39.300 --> 02:08:47.360
I don't know, actually you'll be surprised, we have a trust, there we have trustees, I've never even seen the accounts or anything. I have a Chartered Accountant who comes and sees and

02:08:47.540 --> 02:08:52.500
corrects it but I, I don't touch money. I don't need, why did I need money for, for what?

02:08:53.020 --> 02:09:00.440
- For raising the Kundalini you don't need any money
-  For travelling and all that?
- Travelling My husband pays na, My husband pays just now for Me

02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:07.280
But even supposing you pay for My travelling, supposing, in case, supposing My husband says, "I will not pay," supposing

02:09:07.460 --> 02:09:14.480
then you don't pay Me, you pay to the aeroplanes, isn't it? You pay Me, you see, these people, their lifestyle

02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:20.960
[LAUGHTER] you see, the whole lifestyle [CLAPPING]

02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:28.620
whole lifestyle they, they have 600 crores of diamonds this, that - yousee, this is not good. In the name of God,

02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:34.020
in the name of God you cannot make your livelihood - even livelihood is wrong, even the livelihood.

02:09:34.460 --> 02:09:40.840
You have seen people like Tukaram and all that. You see, Christ was born to a carpenter, He lived like a carpenter.

02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:47.420
Now My, you see, I come from a rich family, I must say. We are from Shalivahanas, you see, Royal family. My,

02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:55.020
We are well off people. My husband also comes from a rich family and he's a very big man there also and he's got a big, big, big pay and all that.

02:09:55.340 --> 02:10:02.940
All that is there but, still, I can live anywhere; I can live in a hut, I can live anywhere - I've no problems

02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:10.560
because you see, if you just seek the comforts of your Spirit, so supposing, they are paying for this - it's all right, let them pay.

02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:17.660
But this doesn't mean that they pay Me for Kundalini awakening. You see, make a clear cut understanding

02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:24.780
that for Spirituality you cannot pay. Haan, you can pay for material things now, you have to pay after all but it's not much, you see,

02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:32.300
if, if you are a sahaja yogi, so many miracles happen. They say, "Mother, we got it for a very cheap thing,

02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:40.100
we got it for a very," you see, it all works out so well. I started sahaja yoga with one person and you can imagine

02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:47.660
uh.., of course I did spend money quite a lot before that but now I don't spend so much money as they are organising everything

02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:55.660
except for travelling. Now My husband wants to pay for travelling. Last time they had a fight, they said, "She shouldn't, She shouldn't pay for our salvation."

02:10:56.020 --> 02:11:01.820
So there was a fight, in England, about it but still My husband insisted, "Nothing doing, let me pay for Her travel."

02:11:02.220 --> 02:11:10.220
And he's kept money for Me there so that I should not have any problem about travelling. You see, we have children married in very good families

02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:17.340
and they're also very satisfied people and you know about My husband. He's a well-known honest man, I mean, he's honest to a

02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:25.620
uh.. fault, very honest man. He was with Shastriji and he's got Padmabhushan for that and he's known for his honesty

02:11:25.860 --> 02:11:31.480
- and I like it because we need today honest people.
- What is the message?

02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:38.700
The message is that we are the Spirit and we have to become the Spirit.

02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:45.880
This is the last evolutionary living process - from human, human life, from human awareness

02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:52.160
you have to get the Spiritual awareness and the whole thing will change. Now we have people with 36 nations

02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:56.140
such brotherhood, such love, no quarrel, nothing.

02:11:56.520 --> 02:12:02.220
- But they are only handful of people.
- No, no, no. There are thousands. In every country there are thousands.

02:12:02.860 --> 02:12:09.040
In thousands. To start with, of course, but not now. These are only selected people who have come here.

02:12:11.420 --> 02:12:19.480
See there are thousands and thousands and many could be. You see, we should, we should think that we all should help and we all should be like them - why not?

02:12:22.020 --> 02:12:28.260
That means you want to have many people - is a very good idea. You should have many people like that - why not?

02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:37.500
Is a very good idea to think that we should have many more; I would love to do. I mean, My age, do you know, is 67 years now and

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:45.340
I'll be starting My 68th year this March but still I'm travelling so much and I hardly sleep and hardly eat -

02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:53.360
I mean, I'm working so very hard so I'll be very happy. As long as I can live, I would like to work and spread the message everywhere

02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:59.140
and get people their realization. This is all predicted in our books. In Nadi Granth they have all predicted it.

02:12:59.360 --> 02:13:06.340
Even Rabindra babu has described it. There's one Louis,  is a great poet in England,

02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:13.880
he has described it clearly and of course, I must say, William Blake, if you have read William Blake, he's described it very clearly.

02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:19.800
We had it in Nadi Granth completely written down, the complete sahaja yoga and Gyaneshwara has described  as Pasaydaan

02:13:19.980 --> 02:13:26.980
so there has been seers who have described it; So the time has come for us to change and to enjoy - so why not enjoy?

02:13:31.360 --> 02:13:34.600
Then in the newspaper, you'll be only talking about sahaja yoga.

02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:41.600
As we have a a newspaper, we talk only about sahaja yoga - what happened, how people gained this thing, how they were

02:13:42.000 --> 02:13:48.120
rewarded, how, what nice things happened - everything nice, nothing shocking - no sensations.

02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:57.080
So, I mean, I, I would say that you should take to sahaja yog. Firstly, you will not get into any diseases,

02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:02.820
alright, secondly, mentally you'll be very satisfied and a happy person

02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:10.580
emotionally, you'll be a very balanced person. You'll become a real

02:14:11.020 --> 02:14:17.500
uh correspondent because you'll develop a witness state - a witness state where you'll not be biased

02:14:17.740 --> 02:14:25.320
and you can penetrate into the problems - you'll be able to know what's going wrong and thirdly you'll become a peaceful personality,

02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:33.500
absolutely peaceful and that peace is what we need today; Only talking about peace, peace doesn't come - peace has to come from within.

02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:41.860
And you'll be a very righteous person, you'll be very proud of your virtues and you'll enjoy each other all over the world;

02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:45.160
They're all your brothers and sisters from all over the world.

02:14:47.180 --> 02:14:51.520
Alright? It's very relaxing and beautiful

02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:58.620
[MARATHI]

02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:07.660
[ALL CLAP AND GARLAND SHRI MATAJI]

02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:15.700
So we have to be very pragmatic and we have to be very constructive and something so unique we have which we have to put forward

02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:22.340
and I would say that you will pay full attention to it, you'll go through it, read it and put it the way you like

02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:29.320
but the best thing is to write about sahaja yog; These all these things are - there's already a criminal case on these people, so it's alright, don't you worry.

02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:32.700
- Hello!
- Some more flowers.

02:15:33.260 --> 02:15:39.220
- Ah...
- [CLAPPING]

02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:46.760
- [CLAPPING]

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:52.340
Can you imagine that Germans went to Russia to give them realization - Germans?

02:15:52.600 --> 02:16:00.380
Can you imagine such a thing happening that Germans went to Russia to give realization? So all this kind of a mutual understanding, mutual

02:16:00.640 --> 02:16:07.020
- What's it? From Austria?
- Can You solve this Punjab problem?
- Of course, why not, hundred percent.
- Oh!

02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:13.680
- I'll tell you.
- [CLAPPING]
- [UNCLEAR] He's saying it's very lucky for the

02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:19.220
Yes, it's a, it's a very easy thing, you see. We have so many Sikhs in our community

02:16:19.460 --> 02:16:26.600
Mr. Khurana is a Sikh. What work I'm doing, is the work of Gurunanaka himself.

02:16:27.460 --> 02:16:34.340
Gurunanaka is the one who has written clearly about Kundalini. Kabira has described it so clearly in that.

02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:41.380
He was so systematic that he got all the great saints of our country together to put this Granth Sahab.

02:16:42.440 --> 02:16:48.280
In the Granth Sahab there is Namadeva also - Namadeva was a great saint from India and he made him learn

02:16:48.500 --> 02:16:54.800
Punjabi language and such a big book he has written. Now, if you can put before them

02:16:55.200 --> 02:17:02.320
the ideals of Gurunanaka and what Namadeva has written and all that - you see they are disturbed people

02:17:02.740 --> 02:17:09.240
but if you tell them that there is a way to get realization - I must tell you one thing - Sikhs and Muslims are the best to get realization;

02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:15.200
Once they get it, they are there somehow or the other because they talk of abstract, I think, somehow

02:17:15.540 --> 02:17:23.320
and we have so many Sikhs now - in Delhi there are so many Sikhs who are coming to sahaja yoga and once it spreads to that side, I'm sure, everything will neutralize,

02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:33.440
- everything will neutralize.
- and I saw several Pakistani's also and they were talking
- Haan, haan we have Pakistani's also - yes, of course. [MARATHI]

02:17:35.300 --> 02:17:42.060
We have Pakistani's also - yes, true; We have from 36 nations we have people here so you can imagine

02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:59.980
It can be easily solved. You see, what we have to do - sahaja yoga has a healing process - it heals,

02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:06.960
it heals your wounds, it heals your problems, you see. So, if the heal,

02:18:07.380 --> 02:18:14.860
the healing process in Punjab could be put, they'll heal up and everything will be pacified absolutely.

02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:22.460
Just what you need is the healing process. I think, we have never used the power of love so far - only the hatred.

02:18:22.660 --> 02:18:30.040
Now, if you use the power of love, which I'm talking about - this All-Pervading power's love - it's very easy to work it out.

02:18:30.880 --> 02:18:35.220
You'll be surprised, when I was going for the yoga seminar - I had been to Russia before -

02:18:36.620 --> 02:18:43.140
My husband said, "You have been just now to Russia, why do You want to go again?" I told him, "I have to go because we'll get Eastern Bloc there

02:18:43.780 --> 02:18:50.120
and I want to break the Eastern Bloc [UNCLEAR], I have to go." He said, "For two days?" "Yes, yes," I said, "I'm sure, there will be Eastern Bloc."

02:18:50.520 --> 02:18:57.120
and you'll be surprised, in that Yoga seminar they had given Me 45 minutes and they were all people from places

02:18:57.600 --> 02:19:05.340
like East Germany, then all other these Eastern Bloc people, all of them were there and they got realization;

02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:13.560
30 minutes they allowed Me to talk and 15 minutes gave them realization and I walked out - they all walked out with Me - there was nobody left in the hall.

02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:21.540
They gave their addresses of these places Czechoslovakia, every, Poland and all that and can you imagine, as soon as they went back, it cracked,

02:19:21.960 --> 02:19:28.820
it triggered. So, if we have some sahaja yogis from Punjab, who get to sahaja yoga and they go there, it will work out

02:19:29.040 --> 02:19:35.780
because they emit peace - such personalities emit peace. It is at a higher level we have to try,

02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:41.420
not with words or anything. You see, today you might say, "You are my brother, you are my sister,"

02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:47.100
[ASIDE - KHAIYE, KHAIYE NA, ITTI DER HO GAYI KYA KAR RAHE HO? AEY,  DEO, TUM DEO - THODA, THODA KHAO. ARRE BHAI THODA KHAO KYA KARTE HO.

02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:53.180
ABHI MA KE GHAR MEIN AAYE HO, TUM KHANA NAHIN KHAOGE? LEO THODA KHAO CHALO, BAHUT DER HO GAYI. TAB SE BAITHE HO]

02:19:54.440 --> 02:19:58.220
YEH LOG SAB KHA KE AAYE HONGE. HAAN, THEY MUST BE HAVING FOR EVERYONE]

02:19:58.820 --> 02:20:05.020
So, you see, this is, we have never tried it but now see the work of love.

02:20:06.180 --> 02:20:11.980
Now Kaliyuga has gone, now Kritayuga has started where the All-Pervading power is working it out.

02:20:12.460 --> 02:20:18.880
- It's such a
- Rajiv Gandhi said, "We will come to power again."
- Annh?
- Rajiv Gandhi said, "We'll come to power again." [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

02:20:19.200 --> 02:20:27.260
You see, that's not My area - I don't want to say anything about it. Whosoever comes to power again, whosoever it is,

02:20:27.420 --> 02:20:31.240
has to be now a benevolent king, has to be.

02:20:33.700 --> 02:20:36.600
Has to be - there's no doubt about it.

02:20:38.820 --> 02:20:42.860
You see, this coming to power - what's the sense in it, I don't know.

02:20:44.380 --> 02:20:49.840
What is there - they haven't got their own powers. You see, look at Me, I've all the powers with Me,

02:20:50.220 --> 02:20:57.960
so you can call Me a Capitalist. You can say, I've all the powers, so I'm the Capitalist but I can't live without distributing, so I'm the Communist.

02:20:59.260 --> 02:21:04.060
So this power is outside, not inside. Inside to koi power nahin hai.

02:21:04.980 --> 02:21:07.960
Now what is there in these power - nothing is there.

02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:21.680
It is for you to now, to understand that this is neither this way nor that way - it is in the center we are;

02:21:22.020 --> 02:21:28.180
We're talking about how to bring people to the center to transform them. Whether they belong to this party or to that party

02:21:28.380 --> 02:21:33.380
makes no difference - they have to come to the center whether they belong to this country or to that country.

02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:38.920
Now, this gentleman who spoke to you about TM, nowadays he is in South Africa

02:21:39.140 --> 02:21:46.720
and in South Africa we have thousands of sahaja yogis - in South Africa - and they are white people.

02:21:48.580 --> 02:21:54.660
- How long does it take to realize?
- Ramadasa was the same question. He said, "Tat shand."

02:21:55.800 --> 02:22:03.660
Takes hardly, even a second but you better come to our center and it will happen to you, I'm sure. Already you're relaxed, if you see it.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:11.480
It is all your own and the best part of it, your heritage.

02:22:13.820 --> 02:22:19.720
[MARATHI]

02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:28.000
[MARATHI]

02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:35.860
[MARATHI]

02:22:37.500 --> 02:22:45.600
[MARATHI]

02:22:56.440 --> 02:23:02.280
[MARATHI]

02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:10.680
[MARATHI]

02:23:11.380 --> 02:23:15.700
[MARATHI]

02:23:16.040 --> 02:23:22.520
What is there? Have you any objection seeing that film? Better see it, what's there. After all you're saints, you should see also the filth.

02:23:24.100 --> 02:23:31.240
Not Me, annh? I 've had enough of it. [[MARATHI] [HINDI - AAPKE LIYE KHAAS ARRANGE KIYA, EK MINUTE DEKH KE JAO.]

02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:34.860
[HINDI - DEKH KE JAO, YEH DIKHEGA NAHI AAPKO. DEKH KE JAAIYE TO AAPKO PATA HOGA KYON MAIN YEH BAAT KEH RAHI HUUN

02:23:35.100 --> 02:23:40.280
- Why we should see?
- Annh?
- We are not interested in that film.
- Theek hai, koi baat nahin.

02:23:40.640 --> 02:23:47.820
[CLAPPING]

02:23:48.020 --> 02:23:52.040
- Like you have how many days You'll be here?
- Annh?
- In Bombay how many days You'll be here?

02:23:52.300 --> 02:23:59.180
I'm going early tomorrow to Poona but these people are going to be here. I think seriously you work it out

02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:07.360
one day maybe you are the people who'll spread this good news and you will be the people to do some good for this country.

02:24:08.020 --> 02:24:11.300
See, we need people who feel, feel for

02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:36.980
Kya kiya jaaye? Aur yeh paisa banane ka dhandha nahin hai. Yeh to Ramdas swami ne

02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:42.960
[UNCLEAR] [MARATHI]

02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:52.400
Santon ka lakshan hai. [MARATHI]

02:24:55.060 --> 02:25:01.400
Jis chhez se logon ko fayada hota hai, jisse benevolence aata hai woh asal cheez hai.

02:25:03.860 --> 02:25:07.780
Benevolence, otherwise [UNCLEAR]

02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:18.820
- [MARATHI] You're not interested to see?
- No, no. No, no.

02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:23.400
- Alright.
- How many days You'll be here?
- Annh?
- In Bombay, how many days You'll be here?

02:25:23.760 --> 02:25:31.000
I'm going early tomorrow to Poona but these people are going to be here. I think, seriously you work it out;

02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:38.720
One day, maybe, you are the people who'll spread this good news and you will be the people to do some good for this country.

02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:45.640
See, we need people who feel, feel for this, feel for this country.
