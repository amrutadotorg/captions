Abraham Lincoln: I still have a dream. It is
a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:22.182
I have a dream that one day, this nation
will rise up, live out the true meaning of

00:00:22.182 --> 00:00:31.092
it's creed.We hold these truths to be self
-evident that all men are created equal.

00:00:31.092 --> 00:00:39.786
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.786 --> 00:00:49.982
I have a dream that one day on the Red Hills
of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:57.497
sons of former slave owners, will they be able
to sit down together at the table of brotherhood?

00:00:57.497 --> 00:01:05.087
I have a dream, so let freedom ring from
the prodigious hill-tops of New Hampshire,

00:01:05.166 --> 00:01:12.326
let freedom ring from the mighty mountains
of New York, let freedom ring from the

00:01:12.326 --> 00:01:19.359
heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania, let
freedom ring from the snow-capped
Rockies of Colorado

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:26.379
let freedom ring from the curvaceous 
slopes of California but not only that,

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:36.701
let freedom ring from Stone mountain of
Georgia, let freedom ring from Lookout
mountain of Tennessee,

00:01:36.895 --> 00:01:45.365
let freedom ring from every hill and mole-hill
of Mississippi, from every mountain side,

00:01:45.365 --> 00:01:55.457
let freedom ring and when this happens,
when we allow freedom ring, when we

00:01:55.457 --> 00:02:02.002
let it ring from every village and every 
hamlet, from every state and every city,

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:09.739
we will be able to speed up that day when all
of God's children - black men and white men,

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:17.535
Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics,
will be able to join hands and sing in the words

00:02:17.535 --> 00:02:26.328
of the old Negro Spiritual, "Free at last, free at last,
thank God Almighty, we are free at last."

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.287
Shri Mataji: We have to say that, America
is a great country in the universe. It has

00:03:47.287 --> 00:03:55.300
the place of the Vishuddhi chakra, which
is the center of responsibility and discretion

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.817
and they have been so responsible, so far.
They have given such noble ideas of democracy

00:04:01.817 --> 00:04:09.879
and of freedom and all those things which
are really all belonging to God's ideas

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:15.863
and when they talk of all these things, we
must know that there is something much more

00:04:15.863 --> 00:04:20.027
that they can give to the whole world. So
many saints are born in this country

00:04:20.027 --> 00:04:24.310
because they realize that this is the
country where they'll be able to prosper

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.879
better into their spirituality, so it is a
very great responsibility of Americans

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:34.903
to understand that we have had great
leaders, we have had great noble ideas, we

00:04:34.903 --> 00:04:40.082
have got great saints living here - so many
are anxious to come down here. Only thing

00:04:40.082 --> 00:04:45.539
what we have to do, is to establish within
ourselves our Spirit and to be ready and

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:50.518
prepared for this great tremendous work
that is going to come now and this is what

00:04:50.518 --> 00:04:56.605
the world has to do. If emancipation of
the humanity has to take place, it has to

00:04:56.605 --> 00:05:01.828
take place only from inside out and not 
outside in. Another thing I would like to

00:05:01.828 --> 00:05:07.551
tell that the danger is not from the outside
for America, not from anywhere else, it is

00:05:07.551 --> 00:05:13.516
from within themselves, so be careful. We
have to be careful about ourselves the way

00:05:13.516 --> 00:05:18.899
we are destroying. When we say, "What's wrong?"
we go headlong into our destructions.

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:24.636
Human beings should not take freedom
as abandonment but freedom to enjoy

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:30.679
completely and fully; The freedom that
takes you to a destruction, is not freedom

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:35.837
and the right idea of freedom must be taken
and people should know that freedom,

00:05:35.837 --> 00:05:43.620
ultimate freedom is, when you become your
own master, when there are no habits, when

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.939
you cannot be dominated by anything - you
are above everything - that's the freedom

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:52.173
you have to achieve and that is why people
talk, long time back in this country,

00:05:52.173 --> 00:05:56.957
about freedom, they help all the countries
to get their freedom and now it is their

00:05:56.957 --> 00:06:03.212
job to get them their own freedom within
themselves, so that others will also follow.

00:06:03.212 --> 00:06:05.462
May God bless you all!
