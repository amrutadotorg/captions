00:18:51.100 --> 00:19:00.680
Today we are celebrating the birthday of Shri Ganesha.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:10.180
You all know the story of His birth and I need not repeat it.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:22.890
But, as He was created by the Mother only, by Adi Shakti,

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:35.470
in the same way you are all created after Him.

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:46.270
So, you are on the path of Shri Ganesha already.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.850
Your eyes sparkle the same way His eyes sparkle.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:01.430
You all have the beautiful glow on your face as He had.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:06.600
Whether you are small, big or old makes no difference.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:16.470
All the beauty comes to us through the glow of Shri Ganesha.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:23.810
If He's satisfied, then we don't have to worry

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.770
about any other deities,

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.980
because the power of all the deities is Shri Ganesha.

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:34.520
He's like a vice-chancellor sitting on every chakra.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:41.350
Unless and until He signs, Kundalini cannot cross through,

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:49.230
because Kundalini’s the Gauri and is the Virgin Mother of Shri Ganesh.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.600
Now we have to understand that we are here

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:03.020
in the Western society where so much has gone wrong

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.980
because we never bother to look after Shri Ganesha.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:13.730
Christ came and His message spread all over the world.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:26.980
He talked of things which are not practised by Christians, not at all.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:33.140
Because whatever they started is not based on truth.

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:40.730
Truth is that Shri Ganesha took birth as Christ.

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:49.480
If that is the truth, then they have to understand

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:56.180
in the light of Shri Ganesha this great incarnation of Christ.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:11.520
That is, He has told people that “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:19.430
Actually, for a saint, He doesn’t know what is an adulterous eyes,

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:24.020
because He just sees. He just sees.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.390
As Shri Gyaneshwara’s beautifully said, Niranjana Pahane

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.560
to see without any reaction, just to see.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:49.310
That is the quality of innocence, which was brought to light by Christ,

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:56.980
our Lord, but we did not imbibe anyone of these qualities.

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:03.480
Now supposing you are worshipping today Shri Ganesh.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.600
So why are you worshipping Shri Ganesha?

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:17.350
You’re worshipping because your Ganesha must be awakened,

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:21.770
that you should have the qualities of Shri Ganesha within you,

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:27.060
that you should feel that innocence in your eyes.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.520
Otherwise you are a hypocrite.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.980
If you are sitting here and worshipping Shri Ganesha

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:42.560
and you are not trying to put your attention to your ascent

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:50.390
as Shri Ganesh, then it is useless.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:24:01.430
And then He is an eternal child. He doesn't have ego,

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:07.230
He doesn't have any conditionings. So, He’s an eternal child.

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:12.270
We have to become eternal children of our Mother.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:22.350
To get to that state, what do we have to do is simple,

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.730
that o to raise our Kundalini, fix it up,

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:30.470
o to do meditation and o keep our attention inside,

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:34.520
more, and o not to react.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:49.020
Now, to say not to react means just to watch.

00:24:50.810 --> 00:25:01.230
And when you watch without thinking about it, then the truth,

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:06.350
which is really poetry, comes out.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:11.850
That's why a poet sees much more than an ordinary person can see.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:24.310
The inner’s beauty just starts penetrating your vision

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.560
and you start seeing it.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:31.930
So, you have seen children, whatever may be their origin,

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.140
from whatever country they might be coming, whether it is Japan

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:44.480
or whether it is England, India, Australia, anywhere,

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:50.850
see the children are normally very beautiful.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:26:00.140
Once I went to Japan and there was a shrine they wanted Me to see,

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:09.730
so I saw some ladies coming down - three, four ladies.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:16.060
They’re western ladies. They said, “Don’t go. Don’t go.

00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.980
There are some children - horrible.”

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.980
I said, “Why?”

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.100
“They call you witch. They called us all,

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.430
“Witches, witches, witches”, Japanese children.”

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:29.140
I said, “How do you know? They must be saying in Japanese.”

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.850
“No, we asked the meaning,

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:32.850
so they told us it means witches.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:35.980
We look like witches to them, so better not go.”

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:40.270
I said, “It’s all right. Let Me go.” And when I went up,

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:45.230
they all came running, clung to Me, kissed Me, this thing.

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:46.470
They wouldn’t allow Me to go to the shrine

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:50.430
and then they walked all the way to the shrine, they came back.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:53.020
I didn’t know their language or anything. So sweet.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:57.310
Kissing My sari, kissing My hand, so sweet they were.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:01.930
And I was surprised that how is it they call the other ladies

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.980
as witches and to Us, to Me, and My daughters were also with us.

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.180
And My daughters are very fond of children.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.430
So then they said, “You see, why to go to the shrine?

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:13.810
We’ll play with the children.”

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:15.640
I said, „Let’s go to the shrine, after all.“

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:19.430
So when we went up, these children also came with us

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.850
and walked down. And their mothers were so surprised, you see,

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.600
they said normally to all the foreigners,

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:32.600
to all the foreigners they say „witches“ or even to men

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.730
they say they are devils. „Devils are coming.“

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.180
Because Japanese are short people, you see,

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:42.020
and the size of our Western people are quite big

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.140
and perhaps maybe that is the reason, whatever it is

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.230
or maybe something else, I don’t know.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:53.230
And they wouldn’t, I mean, even talk to them.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.520
They all ran away, calling them, „Witches, witches“,

00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:01.930
from the windows and from every corner. Then I realized, you see,

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.980
these small, little children, their Ganesha is awakened in them.

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:11.640
Everybody's Ganesha is awakened when you are born.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:16.730
All the animals have their Ganesha intact with them,

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:20.930
specially the birds. We never think how birds,

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.390
all the way from Siberia go to Australia.

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:29.230
What direction comes to them, from where?

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:33.850
They have got a magnet within themselves. That is Shri Ganesh.

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.230
Magnet is Shri Ganesha.

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:46.890
So, this magnet, which is within us can attract innocent people

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:51.640
and repel cunning, horrible

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.100
as they call witch and devils and all those.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.850
So this magnet has both the qualities,

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:04.350
that it repels those who are not all right

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:08.350
and it attracts those who are innocent.

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:16.350
And that is why in Sahaja Yoga we find that we cannot tolerate

00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:18.980
some people somehow or other, we try, we try, we try.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:21.770
But somehow or other it’s a bit difficult, you know.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:25.480
They don’t know what is the reason. The reason is Ganesha.

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:31.140
Now, in the Western society, as you know,

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:36.270
not that they’ve not paid any attention to their Ganesha quality,

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:44.020
but they have talked too much about the perversion of Shri Ganesha.

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:50.100
They talk on the television, they talk here, there, in every way.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:54.480
The children see it and so many small, little children are suffering

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:58.310
from Shri Ganesh problem, very small children.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:08.180
How do they get into these problems is because of the atmosphere is full of it.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:11.520
Now, in Sahaja Yoga also we have some people

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:17.890
who just stick on hypocritically and they have Ganesha problem.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:23.810
And there are some who support. This fellow can say,

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:27.140
„Oh, I was such a sick man, I had no wife

00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:31.850
or I’ve had no love from my parents“ or anything

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.390
and others start supporting.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:41.430
This kind of sympathy is very dangerous, is extremely dangerous.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.390
First of all, this sympathy ruins that person

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:49.680
who cannot get over his problems and gradually

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.770
you also pick up these problems. Instead of helping him,

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.980
that you do the meditation of Ganesha,

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:03.560
you just sit on the Mother Earth, say „Atharva Sheersha“,

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:07.560
use the candle. Your problem will go away. Instead of that,

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:11.980
they start sympathizing. This is not sympathy.

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:16.310
It’s sym-pathy. „Sym“ means „to share“, „Pathy“ means „pathos.“

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.520
So you share all the problems of that person yourself.

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:25.100
So, never support a wrong thing.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.560
If you really love that person, you care for that person,

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:33.430
you have to tell that person, "This is wrong. This is wrong. This is wrong."

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:41.350
Moreover, in Sahaja Yoga, I’ve seen people of seventy years

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.600
also want to get married. I can’t understand, you know.

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:52.640
After all, loneliness is not possible in Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:57.730
you have so many Sahaja Yogis. Where is the loneliness?

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:01.140
I never feel lonely. I would love to be sometimes.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.770
If you are not with Me, My family is with Me.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:15.140
I’m never alone and I’m never alone when I’m alone, really.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:18.100
I enjoy Myself best when I’m alone

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:23.560
because I have time to reflect back as to what we have achieved,

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:31.180
as to how these moments were beautiful moments of meeting you all,

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:38.560
all those beautiful places I visited with you, all the enjoyments.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.390
So all such people who are explaining

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:47.810
their problems of Mooladhara have to know one thing,

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:51.140
that this is a sure certificate for them

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:56.560
to go to hell, absolutely.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.560
Because either from the Mooladhara, you know,

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:03.600
all kinds of diseases come in which are incurable,

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:10.470
according to the doctor. Say, you take multiple sclerosis.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.430
From multiple sclerosis through all the disabilities of the muscles,

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:24.470
even cancers could be started by Mooladhara problem.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:30.230
Why is it so much cancer in the Western countries

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:36.390
than in any other countries? Everybody has an explanation.

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:39.560
Somebody said there are not so many doctors of cancer,

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:44.810
that’s why there are. It’s not so.

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:50.100
Now, you see the disease of schizophrenia

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:54.350
also can come from Mooladhara problem.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:34:00.100
Of course, you know AIDS is nothing but Mooladhara problem.

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.850
But still, if you want to make a martyrdom out of that, that

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:10.390
„We are AIDS soldiers walking to our death,“

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:14.230
then what can you do to such stupid people?

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.180
And stupidity comes also from Mooladhara,

00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:28.020
because He is the giver of wisdom.

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:33.020
How do you get the wisdom?

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:39.890
Only by awakening your Shri Ganesh. He is the giver of wisdom.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:50.350
Now, all kinds of people do stupidities, unbelievable - unbelievable.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:56.560
Like in India recently I asked them for bigger bangles,

00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:02.770
for the ladies have bigger hands here and they came back

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:06.850
to say that these days all big bangles are going to America.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:08.310
So why?

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:13.020
Because the men have decided to wear bangles in America.

00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:18.020
Now in India, if you give one bangle to any man,

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:21.390
means an insult to him that „You are not a man.“

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:31.350
All such stupidities, hundred and one, I tell you,

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.850
you see all over the world now because have come out of it.

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:40.730
All kinds of things come because their Mooladhara is not all right.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:48.770
In India now, for example, we all wear saris. Nobody knows.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.680
I mean, logically also we should wear saris

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:56.140
because saris are made by villagers and they earn out of it

00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:58.810
and that’s how we support this thing. Culturally,

00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:04.310
we like it also because it suggests we are shy women,

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:09.310
we don’t want to expose our body too much and thirdly,

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:11.520
it’s very good for the mothers,

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.270
that mothers can nurse the children and look after them.

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:25.480
So, it has various aspects, but nobody thinks the logic of it.

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:30.640
They think it’s very practical and it has been there for traditions.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.520
Now, supposing you say, „All right, come along,

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.600
give up your saris and wear something else,“

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:40.470
they’ll say, „Now, tell us another. No, no. Nothing doing.“

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:49.850
Nobody would accept it. Nobody would accept it, because they think

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:53.640
that saris are more gracious, they make you look like a woman.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.390
There’s so much beautiful dress

00:36:55.390 --> 00:37:00.930
and it does give chance for the artist to express themselves.

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:04.180
But this is only some intellectuals might be thinking,

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:09.230
but normally in the villages, if you tell them that you change over,

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:13.180
they say, „No.“ So nothing like a fashion can work out.

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:16.470
Nothing like a fashion can work out

00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:22.020
because traditionally now they have reached certain stage of wisdom,

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:24.310
„Now, this is the best suited for us.“

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.850
So they won’t accept any nonsense.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:33.680
Ha, if it is something sensible, which is never so,

00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:36.810
I would say, from the West, they may.

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:40.600
But because the Western people have lost their wisdom,

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:44.270
there is nothing that comes sensible to India, nothing.

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:48.310
And whatever sensible they have, that is also going out.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:51.770
Yesterday you heard such beautiful waltz.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:54.060
I mean who plays these days waltz?

00:37:55.100 --> 00:38:00.850
Thousands will gather at some sort of a noisy pop, hard music,

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:06.060
which can penetrate into your ears and can make you deaf.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.100
There’s no wisdom in all these things.

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:11.810
They want all the time some sort of a sensation.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:15.060
I was told people come here for skiing.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.560
Now some I saw people jumping with a parachute.

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.390
Ask an Indian. He’ll say, „You better do it.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.230
I’m not here to break my legs.“

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:30.980
That he understands the wisdom that

00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.560
„My body is more important than anything else.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.350
What is this sensation for?“

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:39.850
The skiing, so many people have seen, they’ve lost their kidneys.

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:43.470
They have lost their legs. They’ll have artificial legs for skiing.

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:50.850
This sensation comes as a great attraction for people

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:57.140
who have no wisdom. It doesn't appeal to the wisdom.

00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:06.180
So, the people who are wise don’t take to stupid things.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:16.430
Though Shri Ganesha is the child, but He is the giver of wisdom.

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:20.230
So we can say our children are the giver of wisdom

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:22.810
if we keep them on the line of wisdom.

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:28.770
You listen to them, how they talk, how wisely they talk.

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:30.600
Sometimes they have a conference with Me

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:34.470
and they tell Me all about you people, what you are up to

00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.100
and they take Me into confidence completely and say that

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:43.810
„Don’t tell uncle or auntie, but we’ll tell You this.“

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:51.310
And small, small things they say, that „auntie was wearing the sari

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:55.350
You gave her and then, you know, she put it on the ground.“

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.480
All little, little things they know, so sweet they are.

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:04.560
See yesterday how they came rushing and kissed Me so sweet,

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:10.680
without them the world would have been like a desert without any flowers, you know.

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:16.520
So, Shri Ganesha has created you.

00:40:16.770 --> 00:40:18.430
Because of Him, you were born.

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:23.230
He’s the one who looked after you when you were in the womb of the mother.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:32.310
He's the one who saw to it that you are born at the right time.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:37.520
He’s the one who has looked after your nourishment, everything.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:41.890
He's the one who has looked after your development of the fetus,

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:43.640
of the brain and everything.

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:48.390
All is done that by this great personality, Shri Ganesh.

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:54.600
How much we owe to Him. Apart from that,

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:59.980
He gives us the basic wisdom. I mean, a villager,

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:02.470
supposing you talk to a villager who is not exposed

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:06.020
to all these non-sensical sensations, you’ll find him

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:08.850
extremely practical and wise.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:15.680
There’s a story that one villager was travelling by train with other boys

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:20.270
who were very flamboyant and thinking that they were very smart.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:22.850
So, they were trying to tease the man.

00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:27.850
So, a boy asked a question to him.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:37.350
„Now, if the butter is selling for one pound, for a quarter of a pound,

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:44.180
what will be the price of the egg in the next station?“

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:50.600
He looked at him. He said, „All right, you tell me what.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:55.850
Then, you cannot tell the price of the egg,

00:41:55.890 --> 00:42:06.560
then can you tell me the price, can you tell me my age?“

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:11.980
He looked at him. He said, „You must be twenty-two.“

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.060
He said. „How do you know?“

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:20.810
He said, „I have a brother who is eleven years and he is half mad,

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:23.140
but you are full mad.“

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:42.140
So, an ordinary villager answered this smart fellow

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.980
and the smart fellow didn’t know where to go.

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:54.730
So, all this smartness and cleverness finishes off

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:57.980
when it comes to innocence.

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:06.390
Now, many people have a feeling also that we have lost our innocence.

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:11.100
That is something, an eternal quality you have got.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.310
You never lose your innocence.

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:19.100
Maybe, as clouds can cover the whole sky,

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:22.680
maybe your ego and conditionings and your mistakes

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:28.100
might have covered it, but it is always there, always there.

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:34.480
Only thing, it is for you to respect it, to behave in a manner

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:40.770
that you respect your innocence.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:44.680
Not to feel shy about your innocence, never.

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:49.060
Your innocence itself is a power and your innocence

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:59.020
will definitely give you that wisdom by which

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:03.520
you can solve all the problems without any difficulty.

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:09.600
But in a deeper way, if you see who is Shri Ganesha,

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:15.850
He is the child of Adi Shakti.

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:21.480
She created Him from the Aumkara.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:26.230
Now, Aumkara is the Logos, as you call it, is the first sound

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:36.730
when Sadashiva and Adi Shakti separated, for creation.

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:43.890
That sound is used as Aumkara which are vibrations,

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:57.640
which have light in it. They have all the causals of all the elements,

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.680
only on the right side.

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:07.890
Then left side, it has the power of your emotions.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:12.560
In the centre it has the power of your ascent.

00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:23.180
So it's a very powerful deity we have and He's playful.

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:30.310
Children are seldom cruel. He's not cruel,

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:39.810
but if anything is done against the Mother, then He goes all wild.

00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:47.560
Then He punishes and that is how the divine justice is brought to people.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:56.470
Thus, if we surrender to Shri Ganesh, He protects us,

00:45:57.560 --> 00:46:02.060
He gives us wisdom, He gives a proper understanding,

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:04.270
the protocol of the Mother.

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:10.390
He does not know any other deity but His Mother.

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:16.560
He doesn't bother about any other deity but His Mother,

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:21.390
and He knows that She’s the most powerful deity.

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:29.100
And this is His wisdom, which must be imbibed.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.560
When you pray, you must try to imbibe that.

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:44.230
For many people are still in the West anxious to copy other people,

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:48.640
fall back into the wrong ideas,

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:56.930
which have really kept them away from the Truth.

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:00.480
Thank God you all have come out of it

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:06.470
and when you see the hell into which the Western society has fallen,

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:13.060
you try to understand and enjoy that you are at a different state altogether.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:17.980
But still, among you there will be some who will be dangling.

00:47:18.310 --> 00:47:21.020
Try to pull them out, not to throw them inside

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.560
and go also with them.

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:25.350
If you sympathize with them, you’ll go down with them.

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:29.480
Try to pull them out and tell them that „you have to come out“.

00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:33.520
It maybe little painful to them, doesn’t matter, but they’ll be saved.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:38.980
So you are here as saviours and you have the power of Shri Ganesha,

00:47:39.020 --> 00:47:41.980
which is to be used. So today's Puja

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:45.770
is specially to be done with a prayer in your heart that:

00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:52.980
„Shri Ganesha, please be kind and merciful and forgiving

00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:56.350
that You manifest within ourselves.

00:47:56.890 --> 00:48:00.890
Let all these hypocritical things, all these conditionings

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:04.600
and all these wrong ideas we have

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:08.680
or all the wrong life we have had,

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:16.230
should just disappear like thin air, and let the beautiful moonlight

00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:23.060
of your soothing qualities of innocence be manifested through us.”

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:26.730
Let us manifest these qualities.

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:29.430
This is what is to be asked.

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:33.270
Today is a great day. I’m very happy we are in Austria,

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:40.140
which I call is the country of divine weapons.

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:43.980
It’s a very wonderful country, as I told you before

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:46.390
that there is no fundamentalism here.

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.390
It’s very surprising, but I have discovered that in Austria

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:52.350
there have been people from all over the world

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:55.810
and they have been married here, it’s a small country,

00:48:55.810 --> 00:49:00.230
so they all kept together. It’s a very nice place,

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:01.980
specially this place where we are.

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:08.310
I heard that it’s called as the holy land of Tyrol.

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:13.680
And we also saw lots of grace falling down with our eyes.

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.270
Everybody could see them, the grace coming down.

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:18.230
There was no rain, but you could see the grace.

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:25.470
Moreover, yesterday, the villagers remarked that this river overflows.

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:31.140
The whole glacier comes down and this river overflows,

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:34.680
but it did not. It kept to its maryadas.

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:37.390
They are quite surprised how it has happened

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.430
that it kept to its maryadas.

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:49.060
This is one thing and the second thing is they said

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:57.230
that they have never heard such great, absolutely volcanic,

00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:03.180
roaring of the clouds, they’ve never heard such reports before

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:07.100
and it was really remarkable it rained so heavily

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.930
everything happened and we are all right.

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:13.100
Only in the central path of Sushumna it cleared out.

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:17.390
Maybe because I had to walk through that, so it cleared out that part.

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:23.480
But on the whole, all our programs went off very well

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:27.020
and we all enjoyed the last night’s program

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:31.470
and the musician also lost all count of time,

00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.470
he played for four hours on his own.

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:35.730
I thought he’d just play one raga.

00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:38.480
He went on and he wanted to play more, but then,

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:42.100
thank God, he thought of the puja perhaps and he stopped it.

00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:49.270
So, let us try to be innocent within our self.

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:50.980
Be proud that we are innocent.

00:50:51.350 --> 00:50:52.890
We need not be smart people.

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.560
Smartness is your mental attitude

00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:03.600
and innocence is your innate quality

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:07.730
which is connected with this all-pervading power.

00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:12.480
So, may God bless you all!

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.810
At least during the Puja there should not be

00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:28.020
any movements outside or nearby.

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.470
If the children are sitting, well and good,

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:34.520
otherwise you can go out. But you shouldn’t disturb others

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:36.480
because their attention goes to you.

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:39.890
So, all those who are having any movements,

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:43.100
all of you also should come and sit with your children.

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:44.850
Why can’t your children sit down?

00:51:44.850 --> 00:51:46.850
They will sit, bring them in.

00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:49.310
Or if they are not sitting you go behind the curtain,

00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:52.480
because they get disturbed, you see, there are Sahaja Yogis still

00:51:52.890 --> 00:51:54.600
who are getting disturbed very easily

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.640
with the slightest movement here and there.

00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:05.270
So, the first thing is to open your heart for Shri Ganesha.

00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:08.230
As you see a child, how your heart opens.

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:10.980
In the same way, please open your hearts.

00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:24.230
All right …

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:33.270
Ah, see, one thing is that He has got a hunter in His hand

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:41.480
and if you remember Christ used a hunter to hit all the people,

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:44.390
who were selling goods near the temple.

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:52.560
He could have used any other weapon, but He used a hunter.
