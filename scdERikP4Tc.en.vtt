WEBVTT

18:51.100 --> 19:00.680
Today we are celebrating the birthday of Shri Ganesha.

19:04.310 --> 19:10.180
You all know the story of His birth and I need not repeat it.

19:12.350 --> 19:22.890
But, as He was created by the Mother only, by Adi Shakti,

19:30.770 --> 19:35.470
in the same way you are all created after Him.

19:41.100 --> 19:46.270
So, you are on the path of Shri Ganesha already.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.850
Your eyes sparkle the same way His eyes sparkle.

19:55.600 --> 20:01.430
You all have the beautiful glow on your face as He had.

20:02.810 --> 20:06.600
Whether you are small, big or old makes no difference.

20:08.890 --> 20:16.470
All the beauty comes to us through the glow of Shri Ganesha.

20:18.730 --> 20:23.810
If He's satisfied, then we don't have to worry

20:23.810 --> 20:25.770
about any other deities,

20:26.430 --> 20:29.980
because the power of all the deities is Shri Ganesha.

20:30.560 --> 20:34.520
He's like a vice-chancellor sitting on every chakra.

20:35.180 --> 20:41.350
Unless and until He signs, Kundalini cannot cross through,

20:42.020 --> 20:49.230
because Kundalini’s the Gauri and is the Virgin Mother of Shri Ganesh.

20:53.100 --> 20:56.600
Now we have to understand that we are here

20:56.640 --> 21:03.020
in the Western society where so much has gone wrong

21:03.560 --> 21:07.980
because we never bother to look after Shri Ganesha.

21:09.470 --> 21:13.730
Christ came and His message spread all over the world.

21:15.680 --> 21:26.980
He talked of things which are not practised by Christians, not at all.

21:28.180 --> 21:33.140
Because whatever they started is not based on truth.

21:34.770 --> 21:40.730
Truth is that Shri Ganesha took birth as Christ.

21:45.100 --> 21:49.480
If that is the truth, then they have to understand

21:49.520 --> 21:56.180
in the light of Shri Ganesha this great incarnation of Christ.

22:00.560 --> 22:11.520
That is, He has told people that “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

22:14.980 --> 22:19.430
Actually, for a saint, He doesn’t know what is an adulterous eyes,

22:20.770 --> 22:24.020
because He just sees. He just sees.

22:25.980 --> 22:30.390
As Shri Gyaneshwara’s beautifully said, NIRANJANABANI

22:31.520 --> 22:34.560
to see without any reaction, just to see.

22:40.680 --> 22:49.310
That is the quality of innocence, which was brought to light by Christ,

22:50.850 --> 22:56.980
our Lord, but we did not imbibe anyone of these qualities.

22:59.930 --> 23:03.480
Now supposing you are worshipping today Shri Ganesh.

23:07.140 --> 23:09.600
So why are you worshipping Shri Ganesha?

23:12.560 --> 23:17.350
You’re worshipping because your Ganesha must be awakened,

23:18.230 --> 23:21.770
that you should have the qualities of Shri Ganesha within you,

23:22.640 --> 23:27.060
that you should feel that innocence in your eyes.

23:30.390 --> 23:32.520
Otherwise you are a hypocrite.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.980
If you are sitting here and worshipping Shri Ganesha

23:35.680 --> 23:42.560
and you are not trying to put your attention to your ascent

23:43.060 --> 23:50.390
as Shri Ganesh, then it is useless.

23:52.680 --> 24:01.430
And then He is an eternal child. He doesn't have ego,

24:01.430 --> 24:07.230
He doesn't have any conditionings. So, He’s an eternal child.

24:08.730 --> 24:12.270
We have to become eternal children of our Mother.

24:13.730 --> 24:22.350
To get to that state, what do we have to do is simple,

24:22.520 --> 24:25.730
that o to raise our Kundalini, fix it up,

24:25.730 --> 24:30.470
o to do meditation and o keep our attention inside,

24:30.810 --> 24:34.520
more, and o not to react.

24:43.890 --> 24:49.020
Now, to say not to react means just to watch.

24:50.810 --> 25:01.230
And when you watch without thinking about it, then the truth,

25:03.020 --> 25:06.350
which is really poetry, comes out.

25:06.930 --> 25:11.850
That's why a poet sees much more than an ordinary person can see.

25:14.810 --> 25:24.310
The inner’s beauty just starts penetrating your vision

25:24.310 --> 25:25.560
and you start seeing it.

25:26.930 --> 25:31.930
So, you have seen children, whatever may be their origin,

25:32.640 --> 25:37.140
from whatever country they might be coming, whether it is Japan

25:38.140 --> 25:44.480
or whether it is England, India, Australia, anywhere,

25:45.810 --> 25:50.850
see the children are normally very beautiful.

25:52.640 --> 26:00.140
Once I went to Japan and there was a shrine they wanted Me to see,

26:02.480 --> 26:09.730
so I saw some ladies coming down - three, four ladies.

26:10.930 --> 26:16.060
They’re western ladies. They said, “Don’t go. Don’t go.

26:16.100 --> 26:17.980
There are some children - horrible.”

26:18.520 --> 26:19.980
I said, “Why?”

26:20.100 --> 26:22.100
“They call you witch. They called us all,

26:22.100 --> 26:25.430
“Witches, witches, witches”, Japanese children.”

26:26.350 --> 26:29.140
I said, “How do you know? They must be saying in Japanese.”

26:29.180 --> 26:30.850
“No, we asked the meaning,

26:30.890 --> 26:32.850
so they told us it means witches.

26:32.890 --> 26:35.980
We look like witches to them, so better not go.”

26:36.430 --> 26:40.270
I said, “It’s all right. Let Me go.” And when I went up,

26:40.680 --> 26:45.230
they all came running, clung to Me, kissed Me, this thing.

26:45.230 --> 26:46.470
They wouldn’t allow Me to go to the shrine

26:47.230 --> 26:50.430
and then they walked all the way to the shrine, they came back.

26:50.470 --> 26:53.020
I didn’t know their language or anything. So sweet.

26:53.560 --> 26:57.310
Kissing My sari, kissing My hand, so sweet they were.

26:57.730 --> 27:01.930
And I was surprised that how is it they call the other ladies

27:01.980 --> 27:06.980
as witches and to Us, to Me, and My daughters were also with us.

27:07.350 --> 27:09.180
And My daughters are very fond of children.

27:09.560 --> 27:12.430
So then they said, “You see, why to go to the shrine?

27:12.470 --> 27:13.810
We’ll play with the children.”

27:13.810 --> 27:15.640
I said, „Let’s go to the shrine, after all.“

27:16.390 --> 27:19.430
So when we went up, these children also came with us

27:19.430 --> 27:22.850
and walked down. And their mothers were so surprised, you see,

27:23.180 --> 27:25.600
they said normally to all the foreigners,

27:25.930 --> 27:32.600
to all the foreigners they say „witches“ or even to men

27:32.980 --> 27:35.730
they say they are devils. „Devils are coming.“

27:36.100 --> 27:38.180
Because Japanese are short people, you see,

27:39.020 --> 27:42.020
and the size of our Western people are quite big

27:43.140 --> 27:46.140
and perhaps maybe that is the reason, whatever it is

27:46.470 --> 27:48.230
or maybe something else, I don’t know.

27:50.180 --> 27:53.230
And they wouldn’t, I mean, even talk to them.

27:53.230 --> 27:55.520
They all ran away, calling them, „Witches, witches“,

27:55.560 --> 28:01.930
from the windows and from every corner. Then I realized, you see,

28:01.980 --> 28:06.980
these small, little children, their Ganesha is awakened in them.

28:08.060 --> 28:11.640
Everybody's Ganesha is awakened when you are born.

28:12.730 --> 28:16.730
All the animals have their Ganesha intact with them,

28:17.230 --> 28:20.930
specially the birds. We never think how birds,

28:20.930 --> 28:23.390
all the way from Siberia go to Australia.

28:23.890 --> 28:29.230
What direction comes to them, from where?

28:29.890 --> 28:33.850
They have got a magnet within themselves. That is Shri Ganesh.

28:35.060 --> 28:37.230
Magnet is Shri Ganesha.

28:37.770 --> 28:46.890
So, this magnet, which is within us can attract innocent people

28:47.470 --> 28:51.640
and repel cunning, horrible

28:51.680 --> 28:54.100
as they call witch and devils and all those.

28:55.980 --> 28:58.850
So this magnet has both the qualities,

28:59.640 --> 29:04.350
that it repels those who are not all right

29:04.890 --> 29:08.350
and it attracts those who are innocent.

29:12.100 --> 29:16.350
And that is why in Sahaja Yoga we find that we cannot tolerate

29:16.350 --> 29:18.980
some people somehow or other, we try, we try, we try.

29:19.430 --> 29:21.770
But somehow or other it’s a bit difficult, you know.

29:22.230 --> 29:25.480
They don’t know what is the reason. The reason is Ganesha.

29:28.520 --> 29:31.140
Now, in the Western society, as you know,

29:32.480 --> 29:36.270
not that they’ve not paid any attention to their Ganesha quality,

29:37.730 --> 29:44.020
but they have talked too much about the perversion of Shri Ganesha.

29:46.020 --> 29:50.100
They talk on the television, they talk here, there, in every way.

29:50.480 --> 29:54.480
The children see it and so many small, little children are suffering

29:54.890 --> 29:58.310
from Shri Ganesh problem, very small children.

29:59.930 --> 30:08.180
How do they get into these problems is because of the atmosphere is full of it.

30:08.930 --> 30:11.520
Now, in Sahaja Yoga also we have some people

30:11.980 --> 30:17.890
who just stick on hypocritically and they have Ganesha problem.

30:18.470 --> 30:23.810
And there are some who support. This fellow can say,

30:23.850 --> 30:27.140
„Oh, I was such a sick man, I had no wife

30:27.430 --> 30:31.850
or I’ve had no love from my parents“ or anything

30:32.430 --> 30:34.390
and others start supporting.

30:36.230 --> 30:41.430
This kind of sympathy is very dangerous, is extremely dangerous.

30:41.890 --> 30:44.390
First of all, this sympathy ruins that person

30:45.390 --> 30:49.680
who cannot get over his problems and gradually

30:49.680 --> 30:54.770
you also pick up these problems. Instead of helping him,

30:55.100 --> 30:57.980
that you do the meditation of Ganesha,

30:58.470 --> 31:03.560
you just sit on the Mother Earth, say „Atharva Sheersha“,

31:03.890 --> 31:07.560
use the candle. Your problem will go away. Instead of that,

31:07.600 --> 31:11.980
they start sympathizing. This is not sympathy.

31:12.350 --> 31:16.310
It’s sym-pathy. „Sym“ means „to share“, „Pathy“ means „pathos.“

31:17.600 --> 31:21.520
So you share all the problems of that person yourself.

31:22.060 --> 31:25.100
So, never support a wrong thing.

31:25.680 --> 31:28.560
If you really love that person, you care for that person,

31:28.980 --> 31:33.430
you have to tell that person, "This is wrong. This is wrong. This is wrong."

31:37.180 --> 31:41.350
Moreover, in Sahaja Yoga, I’ve seen people of seventy years

31:41.640 --> 31:45.600
also want to get married. I can’t understand, you know.

31:47.230 --> 31:52.640
After all, loneliness is not possible in Sahaja Yoga,

31:52.640 --> 31:57.730
you have so many Sahaja Yogis. Where is the loneliness?

31:58.390 --> 32:01.140
I never feel lonely. I would love to be sometimes.

32:06.140 --> 32:08.770
If you are not with Me, My family is with Me.

32:09.270 --> 32:15.140
I’m never alone and I’m never alone when I’m alone, really.

32:15.350 --> 32:18.100
I enjoy Myself best when I’m alone

32:18.640 --> 32:23.560
because I have time to reflect back as to what we have achieved,

32:25.100 --> 32:31.180
as to how these moments were beautiful moments of meeting you all,

32:33.390 --> 32:38.560
all those beautiful places I visited with you, all the enjoyments.

32:39.480 --> 32:43.390
So all such people who are explaining

32:43.390 --> 32:47.810
their problems of Mooladhara have to know one thing,

32:47.810 --> 32:51.140
that this is a sure certificate for them

32:51.480 --> 32:56.560
to go to hell, absolutely.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.560
Because either from the Mooladhara, you know,

32:59.810 --> 33:03.600
all kinds of diseases come in which are incurable,

33:03.640 --> 33:10.470
according to the doctor. Say, you take multiple sclerosis.

33:11.100 --> 33:14.430
From multiple sclerosis through all the disabilities of the muscles,

33:15.930 --> 33:24.470
even cancers could be started by Mooladhara problem.

33:25.730 --> 33:30.230
Why is it so much cancer in the Western countries

33:30.270 --> 33:36.390
than in any other countries? Everybody has an explanation.

33:36.770 --> 33:39.560
Somebody said there are not so many doctors of cancer,

33:39.560 --> 33:44.810
that’s why there are. It’s not so.

33:46.770 --> 33:50.100
Now, you see the disease of schizophrenia

33:50.520 --> 33:54.350
also can come from Mooladhara problem.

33:55.890 --> 34:00.100
Of course, you know AIDS is nothing but Mooladhara problem.

34:02.100 --> 34:05.850
But still, if you want to make a martyrdom out of that, that

34:06.180 --> 34:10.390
„We are AIDS soldiers walking to our death,“

34:11.480 --> 34:14.230
then what can you do to such stupid people?

34:15.560 --> 34:19.180
And stupidity comes also from Mooladhara,

34:23.680 --> 34:28.020
because He is the giver of wisdom.

34:30.850 --> 34:33.020
How do you get the wisdom?

34:33.560 --> 34:39.890
Only by awakening your Shri Ganesh. He is the giver of wisdom.

34:41.230 --> 34:50.350
Now, all kinds of people do stupidities, unbelievable - unbelievable.

34:51.600 --> 34:56.560
Like in India recently I asked them for bigger bangles,

34:56.680 --> 35:02.770
for the ladies have bigger hands here and they came back

35:02.770 --> 35:06.850
to say that these days all big bangles are going to America.

35:07.230 --> 35:08.310
So why?

35:08.770 --> 35:13.020
Because the men have decided to wear bangles in America.

35:15.060 --> 35:18.020
Now in India, if you give one bangle to any man,

35:18.060 --> 35:21.390
means an insult to him that „You are not a man.“

35:27.230 --> 35:31.350
All such stupidities, hundred and one, I tell you,

35:32.180 --> 35:35.850
you see all over the world now because have come out of it.

35:36.480 --> 35:40.730
All kinds of things come because their Mooladhara is not all right.

35:41.850 --> 35:48.770
In India now, for example, we all wear saris. Nobody knows.

35:49.350 --> 35:51.680
I mean, logically also we should wear saris

35:51.680 --> 35:56.140
because saris are made by villagers and they earn out of it

35:56.180 --> 35:58.810
and that’s how we support this thing. Culturally,

35:58.850 --> 36:04.310
we like it also because it suggests we are shy women,

36:04.810 --> 36:09.310
we don’t want to expose our body too much and thirdly,

36:09.890 --> 36:11.520
it’s very good for the mothers,

36:11.560 --> 36:14.270
that mothers can nurse the children and look after them.

36:19.770 --> 36:25.480
So, it has various aspects, but nobody thinks the logic of it.

36:25.980 --> 36:30.640
They think it’s very practical and it has been there for traditions.

36:31.020 --> 36:33.520
Now, supposing you say, „All right, come along,

36:33.560 --> 36:36.600
give up your saris and wear something else,“

36:37.230 --> 36:40.470
they’ll say, „Now, tell us another. No, no. Nothing doing.“

36:40.980 --> 36:49.850
Nobody would accept it. Nobody would accept it, because they think

36:50.270 --> 36:53.640
that saris are more gracious, they make you look like a woman.

36:53.680 --> 36:55.390
There’s so much beautiful dress

36:55.390 --> 37:00.930
and it does give chance for the artist to express themselves.

37:01.350 --> 37:04.180
But this is only some intellectuals might be thinking,

37:04.680 --> 37:09.230
but normally in the villages, if you tell them that you change over,

37:09.520 --> 37:13.180
they say, „No.“ So nothing like a fashion can work out.

37:14.430 --> 37:16.470
Nothing like a fashion can work out

37:18.310 --> 37:22.020
because traditionally now they have reached certain stage of wisdom,

37:22.060 --> 37:24.310
„Now, this is the best suited for us.“

37:27.520 --> 37:29.850
So they won’t accept any nonsense.

37:30.430 --> 37:33.680
Ha, if it is something sensible, which is never so,

37:33.890 --> 37:36.810
I would say, from the West, they may.

37:37.230 --> 37:40.600
But because the Western people have lost their wisdom,

37:41.020 --> 37:44.270
there is nothing that comes sensible to India, nothing.

37:44.680 --> 37:48.310
And whatever sensible they have, that is also going out.

37:48.890 --> 37:51.770
Yesterday you heard such beautiful waltz.

37:52.140 --> 37:54.060
I mean who plays these days waltz?

37:55.100 --> 38:00.850
Thousands will gather at some sort of a noisy pop, hard music,

38:01.180 --> 38:06.060
which can penetrate into your ears and can make you deaf.

38:06.480 --> 38:09.100
There’s no wisdom in all these things.

38:09.470 --> 38:11.810
They want all the time some sort of a sensation.

38:12.180 --> 38:15.060
I was told people come here for skiing.

38:15.480 --> 38:19.560
Now some I saw people jumping with a parachute.

38:21.640 --> 38:24.390
Ask an Indian. He’ll say, „You better do it.

38:24.480 --> 38:26.230
I’m not here to break my legs.“

38:28.930 --> 38:30.980
That he understands the wisdom that

38:31.020 --> 38:33.560
„My body is more important than anything else.

38:33.560 --> 38:35.350
What is this sensation for?“

38:36.310 --> 38:39.850
The skiing, so many people have seen, they’ve lost their kidneys.

38:39.890 --> 38:43.470
They have lost their legs. They’ll have artificial legs for skiing.

38:44.770 --> 38:50.850
This sensation comes as a great attraction for people

38:50.890 --> 38:57.140
who have no wisdom. It doesn't appeal to the wisdom.

38:59.730 --> 39:06.180
So, the people who are wise don’t take to stupid things.

39:08.180 --> 39:16.430
Though Shri Ganesha is the child, but He is the giver of wisdom.

39:16.890 --> 39:20.230
So we can say our children are the giver of wisdom

39:20.270 --> 39:22.810
if we keep them on the line of wisdom.

39:24.060 --> 39:28.770
You listen to them, how they talk, how wisely they talk.

39:28.770 --> 39:30.600
Sometimes they have a conference with Me

39:31.060 --> 39:34.470
and they tell Me all about you people, what you are up to

39:37.560 --> 39:41.100
and they take Me into confidence completely and say that

39:41.100 --> 39:43.810
„Don’t tell uncle or auntie, but we’ll tell You this.“

39:46.560 --> 39:51.310
And small, small things they say, that „auntie was wearing the sari

39:51.350 --> 39:55.350
You gave her and then, you know, she put it on the ground.“

39:56.600 --> 40:00.480
All little, little things they know, so sweet they are.

40:00.890 --> 40:04.560
See yesterday how they came rushing and kissed Me so sweet,

40:05.100 --> 40:10.680
without them the world would have been like a desert without any flowers, you know.

40:11.930 --> 40:16.520
So, Shri Ganesha has created you.

40:16.770 --> 40:18.430
Because of Him, you were born.

40:18.850 --> 40:23.230
He’s the one who looked after you when you were in the womb of the mother.

40:23.600 --> 40:32.310
He's the one who saw to it that you are born at the right time.

40:33.180 --> 40:37.520
He’s the one who has looked after your nourishment, everything.

40:38.020 --> 40:41.890
He's the one who has looked after your development of the fetus,

40:41.930 --> 40:43.640
of the brain and everything.

40:43.640 --> 40:48.390
All is done that by this great personality, Shri Ganesh.

40:49.770 --> 40:54.600
How much we owe to Him. Apart from that,

40:55.180 --> 40:59.980
He gives us the basic wisdom. I mean, a villager,

41:00.390 --> 41:02.470
supposing you talk to a villager who is not exposed

41:02.480 --> 41:06.020
to all these non-sensical sensations, you’ll find him

41:06.350 --> 41:08.850
extremely practical and wise.

41:09.390 --> 41:15.680
There’s a story that one villager was travelling by train with other boys

41:15.730 --> 41:20.270
who were very flamboyant and thinking that they were very smart.

41:20.890 --> 41:22.850
So, they were trying to tease the man.

41:25.230 --> 41:27.850
So, a boy asked a question to him.

41:28.180 --> 41:37.350
„Now, if the butter is selling for one pound, for a quarter of a pound,

41:37.730 --> 41:44.180
what will be the price of the egg in the next station?“

41:46.180 --> 41:50.600
He looked at him. He said, „All right, you tell me what.

41:52.060 --> 41:55.850
Then, you cannot tell the price of the egg,

41:55.890 --> 42:06.560
then can you tell me the price, can you tell me my age?“

42:07.020 --> 42:11.980
He looked at him. He said, „You must be twenty-two.“

42:12.640 --> 42:14.060
He said. „How do you know?“

42:14.480 --> 42:20.810
He said, „I have a brother who is eleven years and he is half mad,

42:21.310 --> 42:23.140
but you are full mad.“

42:36.980 --> 42:42.140
So, an ordinary villager answered this smart fellow

42:42.560 --> 42:44.980
and the smart fellow didn’t know where to go.

42:46.520 --> 42:54.730
So, all this smartness and cleverness finishes off

42:56.060 --> 42:57.980
when it comes to innocence.

43:00.930 --> 43:06.390
Now, many people have a feeling also that we have lost our innocence.

43:06.850 --> 43:11.100
That is something, an eternal quality you have got.

43:11.640 --> 43:14.310
You never lose your innocence.

43:14.850 --> 43:19.100
Maybe, as clouds can cover the whole sky,

43:19.600 --> 43:22.680
maybe your ego and conditionings and your mistakes

43:22.730 --> 43:28.100
might have covered it, but it is always there, always there.

43:28.730 --> 43:34.480
Only thing, it is for you to respect it, to behave in a manner

43:35.480 --> 43:40.770
that you respect your innocence.

43:41.770 --> 43:44.680
Not to feel shy about your innocence, never.

43:45.100 --> 43:49.060
Your innocence itself is a power and your innocence

43:49.470 --> 43:59.020
will definitely give you that wisdom by which

43:59.470 --> 44:03.520
you can solve all the problems without any difficulty.

44:05.310 --> 44:09.600
But in a deeper way, if you see who is Shri Ganesha,

44:11.770 --> 44:15.850
He is the child of Adi Shakti.

44:17.100 --> 44:21.480
She created Him from the Aumkara.

44:22.060 --> 44:26.230
Now, Aumkara is the Logos, as you call it, is the first sound

44:26.600 --> 44:36.730
when Sadashiva and Adi Shakti separated, for creation.

44:37.310 --> 44:43.890
That sound is used as Aumkara which are vibrations,

44:46.180 --> 44:57.640
which have light in it. They have all the causals of all the elements,

44:59.060 --> 45:01.680
only on the right side.

45:02.430 --> 45:07.890
Then left side, it has the power of your emotions.

45:09.180 --> 45:12.560
In the centre it has the power of your ascent.

45:13.230 --> 45:23.180
So it's a very powerful deity we have and He's playful.

45:24.430 --> 45:30.310
Children are seldom cruel. He's not cruel,

45:31.470 --> 45:39.810
but if anything is done against the Mother, then He goes all wild.

45:40.430 --> 45:47.560
Then He punishes and that is how the divine justice is brought to people.

45:52.060 --> 45:56.470
Thus, if we surrender to Shri Ganesh, He protects us,

45:57.560 --> 46:02.060
He gives us wisdom, He gives a proper understanding,

46:02.100 --> 46:04.270
the protocol of the Mother.

46:05.480 --> 46:10.390
He does not know any other deity but His Mother.

46:11.600 --> 46:16.560
He doesn't bother about any other deity but His Mother,

46:17.850 --> 46:21.390
and He knows that She’s the most powerful deity.

46:23.020 --> 46:29.100
And this is His wisdom, which must be imbibed.

46:29.100 --> 46:32.560
When you pray, you must try to imbibe that.

46:33.850 --> 46:44.230
For many people are still in the West anxious to copy other people,

46:45.520 --> 46:48.640
fall back into the wrong ideas,

46:49.230 --> 46:56.930
which have really kept them away from the Truth.

46:57.480 --> 47:00.480
Thank God you all have come out of it

47:01.060 --> 47:06.470
and when you see the hell into which the Western society has fallen,

47:07.060 --> 47:13.060
you try to understand and enjoy that you are at a different state altogether.

47:13.520 --> 47:17.980
But still, among you there will be some who will be dangling.

47:18.310 --> 47:21.020
Try to pull them out, not to throw them inside

47:21.180 --> 47:22.560
and go also with them.

47:22.600 --> 47:25.350
If you sympathize with them, you’ll go down with them.

47:25.770 --> 47:29.480
Try to pull them out and tell them that „you have to come out“.

47:29.850 --> 47:33.520
It maybe little painful to them, doesn’t matter, but they’ll be saved.

47:33.560 --> 47:38.980
So you are here as saviours and you have the power of Shri Ganesha,

47:39.020 --> 47:41.980
which is to be used. So today's Puja

47:42.020 --> 47:45.770
is specially to be done with a prayer in your heart that:

47:45.770 --> 47:52.980
„Shri Ganesha, please be kind and merciful and forgiving

47:53.390 --> 47:56.350
that You manifest within ourselves.

47:56.890 --> 48:00.890
Let all these hypocritical things, all these conditionings

48:01.230 --> 48:04.600
and all these wrong ideas we have

48:05.600 --> 48:08.680
or all the wrong life we have had,

48:09.100 --> 48:16.230
should just disappear like thin air, and let the beautiful moonlight

48:16.680 --> 48:23.060
of your soothing qualities of innocence be manifested through us.”

48:24.140 --> 48:26.730
Let us manifest these qualities.

48:27.230 --> 48:29.430
This is what is to be asked.

48:29.770 --> 48:33.270
Today is a great day. I’m very happy we are in Austria,

48:33.680 --> 48:40.140
which I call is the country of divine weapons.

48:40.930 --> 48:43.980
It’s a very wonderful country, as I told you before

48:44.430 --> 48:46.390
that there is no fundamentalism here.

48:46.680 --> 48:50.390
It’s very surprising, but I have discovered that in Austria

48:50.470 --> 48:52.350
there have been people from all over the world

48:52.770 --> 48:55.810
and they have been married here, it’s a small country,

48:55.810 --> 49:00.230
so they all kept together. It’s a very nice place,

49:00.270 --> 49:01.980
specially this place where we are.

49:02.520 --> 49:08.310
I heard that it’s called as the holy land of Tyrol.

49:08.680 --> 49:13.680
And we also saw lots of grace falling down with our eyes.

49:13.680 --> 49:16.270
Everybody could see them, the grace coming down.

49:16.310 --> 49:18.230
There was no rain, but you could see the grace.

49:19.680 --> 49:25.470
Moreover, yesterday, the villagers remarked that this river overflows.

49:25.930 --> 49:31.140
The whole glacier comes down and this river overflows,

49:31.600 --> 49:34.680
but it did not. It kept to its maryadas.

49:35.060 --> 49:37.390
They are quite surprised how it has happened

49:37.560 --> 49:39.430
that it kept to its maryadas.

49:39.810 --> 49:49.060
This is one thing and the second thing is they said

49:49.100 --> 49:57.230
that they have never heard such great, absolutely volcanic,

49:57.640 --> 50:03.180
roaring of the clouds, they’ve never heard such reports before

50:03.560 --> 50:07.100
and it was really remarkable it rained so heavily

50:07.100 --> 50:09.930
everything happened and we are all right.

50:09.980 --> 50:13.100
Only in the central path of Sushumna it cleared out.

50:13.140 --> 50:17.390
Maybe because I had to walk through that, so it cleared out that part.

50:18.680 --> 50:23.480
But on the whole, all our programs went off very well

50:23.810 --> 50:27.020
and we all enjoyed the last night’s program

50:27.480 --> 50:31.470
and the musician also lost all count of time,

50:31.480 --> 50:33.470
he played for four hours on his own.

50:34.060 --> 50:35.730
I thought he’d just play one raga.

50:35.770 --> 50:38.480
He went on and he wanted to play more, but then,

50:38.480 --> 50:42.100
thank God, he thought of the puja perhaps and he stopped it.

50:43.980 --> 50:49.270
So, let us try to be innocent within our self.

50:49.310 --> 50:50.980
Be proud that we are innocent.

50:51.350 --> 50:52.890
We need not be smart people.

50:53.600 --> 50:56.560
Smartness is your mental attitude

50:57.810 --> 51:03.600
and innocence is your innate quality

51:04.100 --> 51:07.730
which is connected with this all-pervading power.

51:08.180 --> 51:12.480
So, may God bless you all!

51:22.600 --> 51:24.810
At least during the Puja there should not be

51:24.850 --> 51:28.020
any movements outside or nearby.

51:28.520 --> 51:30.470
If the children are sitting, well and good,

51:30.770 --> 51:34.520
otherwise you can go out. But you shouldn’t disturb others

51:34.560 --> 51:36.480
because their attention goes to you.

51:36.850 --> 51:39.890
So, all those who are having any movements,

51:39.930 --> 51:43.100
all of you also should come and sit with your children.

51:43.140 --> 51:44.850
Why can’t your children sit down?

51:44.850 --> 51:46.850
They will sit, bring them in.

51:46.850 --> 51:49.310
Or if they are not sitting you go behind the curtain,

51:49.310 --> 51:52.480
because they get disturbed, you see, there are Sahaja Yogis still

51:52.890 --> 51:54.600
who are getting disturbed very easily

51:54.600 --> 51:56.640
with the slightest movement here and there.

52:00.520 --> 52:05.270
So, the first thing is to open your heart for Shri Ganesha.

52:05.770 --> 52:08.230
As you see a child, how your heart opens.

52:08.270 --> 52:10.980
In the same way, please open your hearts.

52:22.480 --> 52:24.230
All right …

53:28.680 --> 53:33.270
Ah, see, one thing is that He has got a hunter in His hand

53:35.230 --> 53:41.480
and if you remember Christ used a hunter to hit all the people,

53:41.520 --> 53:44.390
who were selling goods near the temple.

53:49.470 --> 53:52.560
He could have used any other weapon, but He used a hunter.
