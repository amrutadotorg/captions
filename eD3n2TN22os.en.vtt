05:08.000 --> 05:13.610
I bow to all the seekers of truth!

05:13.610 --> 05:31.280
At the very outset we have to know that truth
is what it is.

05:31.280 --> 05:34.220
We cannot conceptualize it.

05:34.220 --> 05:37.380
We cannot organize it.

05:37.380 --> 05:46.470
Also, we cannot know it at the stage we are,
that is, the human awareness.

05:46.470 --> 05:59.550
We have to become something subtler, something
higher, to know the truth.

05:59.550 --> 06:04.760
And to know the truth you cannot pay for it.

06:04.760 --> 06:07.970
It exists.

06:07.970 --> 06:23.340
Only our evolutionary process has brought
us to the human level and we have to know,

06:23.340 --> 06:28.540
that yet we have not known the Absolute truth.

06:28.540 --> 06:35.500
If you had known Absolute truth, there would
have been no problems, no arguments, no fighting,

06:35.500 --> 06:37.040
no wars.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.930
We did not know that.

06:38.930 --> 06:48.800
And we would not know it because we have to
reach the point where we can know Absolute.

06:48.800 --> 06:56.890
So there’s a little breakthrough more needed
so that we can know the truth.

06:56.890 --> 07:07.790
When we talk of know and knowledge, we have
to understand that it’s not the mental understanding

07:07.790 --> 07:09.630
that is knowledge.

07:09.630 --> 07:20.100
For example, one of the disciples of Christ,
Thomas, travelled down to India and he wrote

07:20.100 --> 07:29.600
lots of treatise in Egypt and put them in
a big jar which was discovered about 48 years

07:29.600 --> 07:30.650
back.

07:30.650 --> 07:40.480
Then they tried to decode it and a book has
already come out of it called as ‘Gnostics’.

07:40.480 --> 07:43.810
He says, those who know, are ‘Gnostics.’

07:43.810 --> 07:49.950
Now imagine the ‘Gn’ words comes from
Sanskrit meaning, to know on your central

07:49.950 --> 07:59.760
nervous system, not mental, but on your central
nervous system whatever we know is the knowledge.

07:59.760 --> 08:04.710
And those who know on their central nervous
system are the ‘Gnostics.’

08:04.710 --> 08:08.040
It’s a wonderful thing they have done.

08:08.040 --> 08:14.540
But still, they are busy with the rest of
the book and they said that truth is an experience

08:14.540 --> 08:16.560
of the truth.

08:16.560 --> 08:20.090
So let us see what is the truth.

08:20.090 --> 08:29.130
Whatever I tell you today you need not accept
it blind folded but you must keep your mind

08:29.130 --> 08:36.440
open like a scientist.

08:36.440 --> 08:46.620
Whatever I say is like a hypothesis for you
and if you find it works out, then you have

08:46.620 --> 08:49.050
to accept it.

08:49.050 --> 08:53.100
As honest people, you have to accept.

08:53.100 --> 09:01.620
Now I say that the truth is that you are the
Spirit.

09:01.620 --> 09:12.870
You are not this body, mind, but you are the
Spirit and the second truth is that there

09:12.870 --> 09:25.670
is an all pervading power of God’s love
which does all the living work.

09:25.670 --> 09:27.730
We take everything for granted.

09:27.730 --> 09:37.480
For example, if we have a seed with us, we
plant it in the Mother Earth and it sprouts

09:37.480 --> 09:38.480
by itself.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.950
It’s a living process.

09:40.950 --> 09:45.120
We take that living process absolutely for
granted.

09:45.120 --> 09:51.040
We don’t want to know how it works out.

09:51.040 --> 09:52.940
It’s spontaneous.

09:52.940 --> 09:55.160
Spontaneous means Sahaj.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.840
Sahaj means born with you.

09:57.840 --> 10:00.750
It is born with you.

10:00.750 --> 10:09.290
The yoga is the union with this all pervading
divine power.

10:09.290 --> 10:16.190
This state is to be achieved by all of you.

10:16.190 --> 10:25.840
Is your fundamental right, your birth right
to achieve it because if you do not achieve

10:25.840 --> 10:35.380
it, you will not know the meaning of your
life, the beauty of your being and the greatness

10:35.380 --> 10:39.050
of your existence.

10:39.050 --> 10:46.580
Like this instrument has got these wires and
if I do not put them to the mains they do

10:46.580 --> 10:47.580
not work.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.480
They have no meaning.

10:49.480 --> 10:56.330
In the same way we are to be connected to
the mains.

10:56.330 --> 11:03.180
Now about Kundalini he has already told you
about this beautiful thing that is within

11:03.180 --> 11:04.860
us.

11:04.860 --> 11:13.150
When we talk about it, you should also not
take it for granted but you can see the results

11:13.150 --> 11:17.870
that you can achieve by this kundalini awakening.

11:17.870 --> 11:26.320
Of course it’s a living process and as you
do not pay any money for sprouting a seed,

11:26.320 --> 11:31.370
in the same way you cannot pay money because
God doesn’t understand money.

11:31.370 --> 11:33.960
He doesn’t understand banking!

11:33.960 --> 11:35.900
He doesn’t understand.

11:35.900 --> 11:41.370
But somehow or the other we feel that we can
purchase God.

11:41.370 --> 11:44.410
We can pay for Him.

11:44.410 --> 11:50.300
Anybody who is available for money cannot
be your master.

11:50.300 --> 11:56.670
He cannot be a person who will deliver the
goods which are divine.

11:56.670 --> 12:04.230
So to achieve anything divine you have to
know one thing that, it is a spontaneous thing.

12:04.230 --> 12:10.620
It is the last breakthrough of your evolutionary
process and as you have not paid anything

12:10.620 --> 12:17.000
to become a human being, you don’t have
to pay anything to become a higher personality.

12:17.000 --> 12:34.100
But, it’s rather surprising how we try to
think in the terms of some mundane method

12:34.100 --> 12:38.950
of achieving this higher state of awareness.

12:38.950 --> 12:49.200
It’s a living process, very simple and just
works spontaneously and the power of kundalini

12:49.200 --> 12:53.820
which is shown here is your individual Mother.

12:53.820 --> 12:58.520
She is the power of pure desire.

12:58.520 --> 13:08.350
As you know, in economics it is said that
in general ‘wants are not satiable.’

13:08.350 --> 13:16.240
That means the desires, jump from one to another
but this is the pure desire which you may

13:16.240 --> 13:23.570
be aware, not aware of it but which acts and
is working within you.

13:23.570 --> 13:26.270
That’s why you’re seeking the truth.

13:26.270 --> 13:29.400
That’s why you want to know what is beyond?

13:29.400 --> 13:32.280
After all why I’m here?

13:32.280 --> 13:39.010
Everybody has this question sometime in life…why
am I on this Earth? and what am I doing here?

13:39.010 --> 13:46.810
Now the answer is only in your achieving the
state of the Spirit.

13:46.810 --> 14:00.050
The state of the Spirit is a state in which
you become a new personality with a new dimension

14:00.050 --> 14:03.430
of your awareness which Jung has described.

14:03.430 --> 14:10.210
Jung has clearly described that once when
you get your self realization you become collectively

14:10.210 --> 14:11.210
conscious.

14:11.210 --> 14:12.480
So its a question of becoming.

14:12.480 --> 14:20.540
It’s not just certifying that you are twice
born, that you are a realized soul, that you

14:20.540 --> 14:24.940
are something of a higher awareness.

14:24.940 --> 14:31.460
It is the state in which you jump.

14:31.460 --> 14:39.190
The state which you know of and you should
also know the modus operandi of the whole

14:39.190 --> 14:40.190
thing.

14:40.190 --> 14:46.700
So the yoga has two meanings; one means the
‘union’ and another meaning the ‘yukti’

14:46.700 --> 14:50.410
means the modus operandi.

14:50.410 --> 14:51.520
You must know how it works.

14:51.520 --> 14:56.020
If somebody says, alright I’ll give you
a name, I mean there have been so many from

14:56.020 --> 15:04.970
my country unfortunately, who have been selling
mantras, marketing God, marketing Ayurveda,

15:04.970 --> 15:11.130
marketing this, marketing that and people
take it for granted.

15:11.130 --> 15:12.820
They don’t know anything about it.

15:12.820 --> 15:18.210
For example TM, I was told, is so strong here,
I better not tell you how far it has gone

15:18.210 --> 15:20.170
to destroy people.

15:20.170 --> 15:28.130
But they charge, to begin with, 300 pounds
for giving mantras and they’re told you

15:28.130 --> 15:30.650
should not talk about it to anyone.

15:30.650 --> 15:36.890
Now these mantras were 3 types – one was
called as ‘inga, pinga, thinga’.

15:36.890 --> 15:41.790
These 3 words are not even Sanskrit and the
person who is supposed to be a ‘Maharishi’

15:41.790 --> 15:45.350
doesn’t even know a word of Sanskrit language!

15:45.350 --> 15:51.320
‘Inga’ means the scorpion bite, pinga
means when a person gets possessed and goes

15:51.320 --> 15:54.110
round and round, that’s ‘pinga’ and
‘thinga’ means showing like this [Shri

15:54.110 --> 15:55.110
Mataji shows Her thumb].

15:55.110 --> 15:58.490
So it was said you’re not to tell this to
anyone.

15:58.490 --> 15:59.490
It’s a secret.

15:59.490 --> 16:00.740
It’s a sacred secret!

16:00.740 --> 16:10.350
Imagine the nonsense of it and people paid
300 pounds for this so called mantra and then

16:10.350 --> 16:15.140
6000 pounds they paid, you’ll be amazed,
for becoming a ‘siddha.’

16:15.140 --> 16:19.640
Now, what is a ‘siddha’ is that they start
flying in the air!

16:19.640 --> 16:20.640
It’s nonsense!

16:20.640 --> 16:24.580
Why do you want to fly in the air about 4
feet above [you see]?

16:24.580 --> 16:28.560
Already we are having problems of the traffic.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.080
It’s absurd!

16:30.080 --> 16:32.050
How can you accept such suggestions?

16:32.050 --> 16:35.210
You’re all very intelligent people.

16:35.210 --> 16:39.060
And they said, that alright, we will give
you a siddha mantra.

16:39.060 --> 16:44.830
So they made them sit on the foam and made
them jump and then when they started jumping

16:44.830 --> 16:48.750
they broke their bottoms and there have been
cases and cases after them.

16:48.750 --> 16:56.450
6000 pounds they charge for this kind of a
nonsense and then they said that we’ll pay

16:56.450 --> 17:01.710
you, I mean you’ll have to become a very
special personality.

17:01.710 --> 17:05.710
So first they gave them the water which boils
some potatoes.

17:05.710 --> 17:07.510
It’s a fact!

17:07.510 --> 17:10.540
I’m telling the truth and I am not afraid
of them.

17:10.540 --> 17:17.520
And then they said, alright you take this
water for 6 days, 6000 pounds, imagine!

17:17.520 --> 17:26.460
And the 7th day, you take, what you call,
the rind of the potatoes and the 8th day the

17:26.460 --> 17:27.820
potatoes.

17:27.820 --> 17:28.820
For what?

17:28.820 --> 17:32.100
For going in the air just like walking up!

17:32.100 --> 17:33.100
What to say?

17:33.100 --> 17:37.870
I don’t know, it’s never described in
any one of the books.

17:37.870 --> 17:44.790
No where such a nonsense is described and
people paid.

17:44.790 --> 17:50.140
And the gentleman who was in charge of this
flying academy, became bankrupt!

17:50.140 --> 17:57.230
His wife, he, his daughter got epilepsy and
then they came to Sahaja Yoga.

17:57.230 --> 18:00.420
He is writing a book about it.

18:00.420 --> 18:05.440
I hope it comes out very soon and you will
know what these TM people are like.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.250
They are marketing everything!

18:07.250 --> 18:12.270
Now they are marketing Ayurveda.

18:12.270 --> 18:16.390
What is the need for these people to market
Ayurveda?

18:16.390 --> 18:23.710
You cannot have Ayurveda in the western countries
because its freshly prepared things.

18:23.710 --> 18:26.270
Only in India you can do it.

18:26.270 --> 18:33.810
But you can market anything to these simple
people, who have no idea as to what it is.

18:33.810 --> 18:43.420
It’s a such a shameful thing for me as an
Indian that such people should come out of

18:43.420 --> 18:47.370
my country but now I am told Americans have
taken over.

18:47.370 --> 18:52.890
Even some Australians have taken over, the
same tricks and they are minting money out

18:52.890 --> 18:56.520
of you.

18:56.520 --> 19:02.290
We had one gentleman who bought Rolls Royces
after Rolls Royces and then they were sold

19:02.290 --> 19:04.750
out, auctioned, you know him very well.

19:04.750 --> 19:07.550
What is the interest of a saint in a Rolls
Royce?

19:07.550 --> 19:08.660
I can’t understand.

19:08.660 --> 19:16.550
For example when I was in Boston they asked
me, Americans special type of brains they

19:16.550 --> 19:20.670
have, so they said, Mother, ‘how many Rolls
Royces you have?

19:20.670 --> 19:22.200
I said, ‘I have none.’

19:22.200 --> 19:23.750
‘Don’t have any Rolls Royces?’

19:23.750 --> 19:26.320
‘No, no I have my husband’s cars, that’s
all!’

19:26.320 --> 19:29.140
He said, ‘then we are not interested, it’s
no business.’

19:29.140 --> 19:32.460
I said ‘no, it’s no business at all , it’s
not a business!

19:32.460 --> 19:33.880
‘Then we are not interested.’

19:33.880 --> 19:37.010
They wouldn’t even take me on the television
for that.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.300
Can you imagine!

19:38.300 --> 19:39.460
This is American brain.

19:39.460 --> 19:46.990
And that’s how they all landed in America
and they marketed everything.

19:46.990 --> 19:52.500
This is to be understood that divinity is
a pure thing.

19:52.500 --> 19:54.040
It purifies you.

19:54.040 --> 20:02.680
It has nothing to do with this materialistic
attitude of these so called saints.

20:02.680 --> 20:06.330
Saints cannot be materialistic.

20:06.330 --> 20:09.980
If they are materialistic, they are not divine.

20:09.980 --> 20:15.870
I have come here to tell you, that all these
things are within yourself.

20:15.870 --> 20:21.040
This is your own power of kundalini.

20:21.040 --> 20:24.220
She is your individual Mother.

20:24.220 --> 20:31.600
She knows each and everything about you and
She’s anxious to give you realization.

20:31.600 --> 20:44.010
And this all pervading power of God’s love,
which is described in every scripture, has

20:44.010 --> 20:52.230
come into a new mood because it was said that
there’re ‘kaliyuga,’ these horrible

20:52.230 --> 20:57.990
modern times, where all kinds of nonsensical
things will take place.

20:57.990 --> 21:08.170
And from changing it from this to ‘Satayuga,’
means the Kingdom of God, in between, in this

21:08.170 --> 21:14.320
interval, this all pervading power has gone
into another mood called as ‘kritayuga’

21:14.320 --> 21:16.420
where it is active.

21:16.420 --> 21:21.200
It is so very active that once you come to
Sahaja Yoga you’ll be surprised and you’ll

21:21.200 --> 21:22.680
say, Mother, ‘what miracles!

21:22.680 --> 21:25.030
This miracle, that miracle.’

21:25.030 --> 21:29.940
See Its God, Its GOD Almighty!

21:29.940 --> 21:34.690
For Him what is a miracle?

21:34.690 --> 21:36.550
We think of God, He’s Almighty!

21:36.550 --> 21:39.120
But we don’t know what it means.

21:39.120 --> 21:47.260
Our faith in God is so limited that we don’t
understand that He is God.

21:47.260 --> 21:51.350
My grandmother used to tell me a very sweet
story.

21:51.350 --> 21:55.700
Like the grandmother story it was…that a
man was going to see God.

21:55.700 --> 22:03.470
So one gentleman met him on the way, and asked
him, asked him, ‘if you’re going to God,

22:03.470 --> 22:08.500
then will you please tell Him that I’ve
been working very hard and when He’s going

22:08.500 --> 22:10.660
to meet me’
He said, ‘alright’

22:10.660 --> 22:15.460
Then he met one gentleman on the street, just
like on the side of the street.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.070
He said, ‘you’re going to God.

22:17.070 --> 22:21.000
Tell Him that I’ve had no food, I’ve had
no food at all’

22:21.000 --> 22:23.180
He said, ‘alright’
He was quite amazed.

22:23.180 --> 22:28.070
Look at this man just informing God that he
had no food.

22:28.070 --> 22:33.900
So he went to God and saw Him and God said
‘now, you’ve some more work?’

22:33.900 --> 22:39.040
He said, ‘no no, you see I met one gentleman
who was saying that he’s working very hard

22:39.040 --> 22:44.180
for You and when are You going to meet him
and he was making enquiries.

22:44.180 --> 22:49.380
He said that I’m waiting for Him.

22:49.380 --> 22:50.970
So You please tell me when will You meet him?’

22:50.970 --> 22:56.440
So God just smiled and said, ‘tell him to
wait for sometime, he has to wait.’

22:56.440 --> 23:02.260
Then the second one, when he told about the
second one, he said, ‘oh God that fellow

23:02.260 --> 23:05.830
was so funny, he just said that You have to
send my food.’

23:05.830 --> 23:08.930
‘Yes yes, of course his food has to be arranged
immediately.

23:08.930 --> 23:11.180
You have to do something about it.’

23:11.180 --> 23:15.490
He couldn’t understand that how these two
reactions are there.

23:15.490 --> 23:19.270
God realized that there’s something confusing
him.

23:19.270 --> 23:25.660
He told him, ‘see now you are confused.

23:25.660 --> 23:29.490
So you go down and tell one thing to both
of them and see their reactions.

23:29.490 --> 23:39.770
So just tell them that I went to God and there
I saw that He made a little camel pass through

23:39.770 --> 23:43.600
the nose of a needle.’

23:43.600 --> 23:48.480
He said, ‘really?’

23:48.480 --> 23:51.600
‘Yes, you just tell them.’

23:51.600 --> 23:53.010
He went down.

23:53.010 --> 23:56.610
The first man met him and he said, ‘what
did God, what did He say?’

23:56.610 --> 23:58.840
‘He said that you just have to wait for
a little while.

23:58.840 --> 23:59.840
I’ll come along but you have to wait.’

23:59.840 --> 24:01.600
‘So I have to still wait?’

24:01.600 --> 24:06.810
‘Yes Yes’
He said, ‘but what did you see there?’

24:06.810 --> 24:17.710
He said, ‘I saw that God, I saw a very big
miracle that He made a big elephant pass through

24:17.710 --> 24:19.710
the nose of a needle.’

24:19.710 --> 24:21.340
‘It’s not possible.

24:21.340 --> 24:22.340
How can it be?

24:22.340 --> 24:24.330
Why are you telling me stories?

24:24.330 --> 24:27.450
Because you have been to God, you’re telling
me stories?’

24:27.450 --> 24:33.770
So he went to another man and he said, ‘yes,
yes of course I knew God would give me food

24:33.770 --> 24:36.860
but I wanted to give some message so I told
you, but I’ve got it, everything.

24:36.860 --> 24:39.350
And what did you see there?

24:39.350 --> 24:49.550
So he said that, ‘that I saw that God made
a camel pass through the nose of a needle.

24:49.550 --> 24:51.420
Its a miracle!’

24:51.420 --> 24:54.670
He said, ‘what a miracle it is!

24:54.670 --> 24:56.090
It’s God.

24:56.090 --> 24:58.230
It’s God Almighty!

24:58.230 --> 25:00.520
What is it, a little camel?

25:00.520 --> 25:04.160
He can make the universes after universes
pass through that.

25:04.160 --> 25:05.710
He’s God Almighty!

25:05.710 --> 25:12.630
So you must understand that God has created
us and that we have reached the state.

25:12.630 --> 25:20.910
Now we have to just travel about 3 to 4 feet
and we are in the kingdom of God.

25:20.910 --> 25:23.810
The time has come for you to achieve it.

25:23.810 --> 25:26.780
But it sounds very fantastic to everyone.

25:26.780 --> 25:29.980
How can it be, how can it be so easy?

25:29.980 --> 25:34.580
I have to say that whatever is important and
vital has to be easy.

25:34.580 --> 25:35.740
For example, our breathing.

25:35.740 --> 25:43.810
For our breathing, if we had to do some exercises,
if you have to read something then, it would

25:43.810 --> 25:47.740
be very difficult.

25:47.740 --> 25:55.080
So we have not understood, so far, that we
are still at a stage that to know God we have

25:55.080 --> 26:02.460
to, little bit, know more and that knowing
more is what we call is self realization.

26:02.460 --> 26:04.290
You can call it by any name.

26:04.290 --> 26:14.830
In any religion, even in ‘Quran,’ is written
that you have to be a ‘Wali’, like we

26:14.830 --> 26:19.220
had some in India, Nizamuddin Sahb, this Chisti,
all of them.

26:19.220 --> 26:24.300
But Mohammed Sahb has clearly said that at
the time of ‘Kiyamah,’ means at the time

26:24.300 --> 26:26.670
of your resurrections, your hands will speak.

26:26.670 --> 26:32.740
Now we should not judge Mohammed Sahb by the
way what Saddam is doing.

26:32.740 --> 26:34.320
He is a devil.

26:34.320 --> 26:36.100
You can see it clearly.

26:36.100 --> 26:41.790
So these people take the name of God, as if
He’s in their pockets and start doing things.

26:41.790 --> 26:47.780
And we start doubting how can it be God’s
work?

26:47.780 --> 26:51.410
God’s work is absolutely beautiful, pure.

26:51.410 --> 26:52.600
He’s compassion.

26:52.600 --> 27:02.170
He is ocean of love and to know Him, first
of all we have to enter into His kingdom.

27:02.170 --> 27:07.050
For example, now I landed here and I came
to know about your customs.

27:07.050 --> 27:12.090
If I was in India, I would not have known
anything about it.

27:12.090 --> 27:18.160
In the same way, if you have not entered into
the kingdom of God, how will you know?

27:18.160 --> 27:21.040
It has nothing to do with what age you are.

27:21.040 --> 27:24.700
It has nothing to do with what ideas you have.

27:24.700 --> 27:28.610
First of all, only thing, you have to be humble
about it.

27:28.610 --> 27:31.470
That so far, you have not known the Absolute.

27:31.470 --> 27:37.720
But once you know the Absolute you become
a part and parcel of the Whole.

27:37.720 --> 27:41.400
The microcosm becomes the macrocosm.

27:41.400 --> 27:42.400
You become.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.450
Again I say you become.

27:43.450 --> 27:48.040
Its not question of giving a false certificate
or assuming that yourself.

27:48.040 --> 27:50.510
For example, Steven now is before you.

27:50.510 --> 27:54.880
He had problems, physical problems also he
had.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.160
All problems solved.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.540
That’s not so important.

27:57.540 --> 27:58.540
But he’s so powerful.

27:58.540 --> 28:04.420
He has given realization to so many people,
but he doesn’t say that, he doesn’t behave

28:04.420 --> 28:10.160
like other funny people do, like you shave
your head off, or you wear some funny dress

28:10.160 --> 28:17.100
or you go about jumping and behaving in a
manner so ridiculous!

28:17.100 --> 28:20.770
There’s no need to do these things outside.

28:20.770 --> 28:22.070
It’s within yourself.

28:22.070 --> 28:26.010
It’s within yourself and it is your own
power.

28:26.010 --> 28:27.320
Its your own.

28:27.320 --> 28:28.320
So why not have it?

28:28.320 --> 28:31.490
And its freely available.

28:31.490 --> 28:38.100
Why not get to that which is your own, your
own property.

28:38.100 --> 28:46.110
Today they asked me to give a more sort of
a introductory lecture about Sahaja Yoga.

28:46.110 --> 28:53.790
It’s such a deep ocean of knowledge that,
I don’t know, I must have given at least

28:53.790 --> 28:59.480
4000 or 5000 lectures in English language
itself and so many other languages but still

28:59.480 --> 29:01.530
the knowledge, they say, ‘Mother, you never
repeat.’

29:01.530 --> 29:05.520
I’m quite surprised that the thing, that
I never repeat anything.

29:05.520 --> 29:09.780
But the ocean is so great, and the more you
swim in it, the more you enjoy.

29:09.780 --> 29:17.240
Now I would only request you, to have an open
mind about it, very open mind.

29:17.240 --> 29:23.660
You must know the problems of this world are
not because of God, they are because of human

29:23.660 --> 29:24.660
beings.

29:24.660 --> 29:25.720
Any problem.

29:25.720 --> 29:33.350
Take ecological problem now; the way we have
gone head long into exploiting our Mother

29:33.350 --> 29:34.350
Earth.

29:34.350 --> 29:38.010
Any problem you take is because of human beings.

29:38.010 --> 29:46.860
So it is important to see why, we human beings
are creating problems for ourselves?

29:46.860 --> 29:58.830
And if you locate the source, it is only one
thing that we have to be transformed.

29:58.830 --> 30:06.910
The transformation of human beings is needed
and if that transformation is accepted and

30:06.910 --> 30:13.640
is worked out, if you become that beautiful
personality, then you will know what you are,

30:13.640 --> 30:22.030
how great you are, what is your potential
and what you can do.

30:22.030 --> 30:29.700
I hope today, most of you will get your realization,
I hope so and also I would like you to ask

30:29.700 --> 30:33.850
me some questions but not aggressive questions.

30:33.850 --> 30:38.740
Ask questions which are relevant because I’m
not here to take anything from you.

30:38.740 --> 30:42.640
I’m here to just give you what is yours.

30:42.640 --> 30:48.210
So ask relevant questions and if you belong
to some group, or to some guru or something,

30:48.210 --> 30:53.780
I have to just say, that if you’re satisfied
with them then you can go all out with them.

30:53.780 --> 31:02.080
But if you’re not, then I have to tell you,
that the only way, is to get to self realization.

31:02.080 --> 31:20.940
There is no other way out.

31:20.940 --> 31:33.530
May God bless you!

31:33.530 --> 31:39.280
Question and Answers:

31:39.280 --> 31:48.610
Question: To reach the level of spiritual
goal are material goals acceptable?

31:48.610 --> 31:55.720
If you want to do some material things, is
that acceptable?

31:55.720 --> 32:03.530
Shri Mataji: After all what is matter?

32:03.530 --> 32:06.300
Is also created by God!

32:06.300 --> 32:10.490
We can’t create anything.

32:10.490 --> 32:20.260
So, when you’re spiritually awakened you
become really extremely compassionate as well

32:20.260 --> 32:22.910
as dynamic.

32:22.910 --> 32:24.860
The energy is all the time flowing through.

32:24.860 --> 32:31.350
Now, can you believe, I am 68 years of age
and I hardly stay in a place for more than

32:31.350 --> 32:32.350
3 days.

32:32.350 --> 32:38.470
Traveling all over the world.

32:38.470 --> 32:39.470
I never get tired.

32:39.470 --> 32:45.490
Anything that is material as you see, for
example you want to buy something, for example.

32:45.490 --> 32:49.670
Take it, a very mundane things you see, you
want to buy.

32:49.670 --> 32:59.470
Now you want to buy something in a shop, if
it is necessary, you go in a shop and you

32:59.470 --> 33:02.170
want to know the price and everything.

33:02.170 --> 33:07.140
Now how will you know whether this is good
or bad?

33:07.140 --> 33:12.140
There’s no way to find out.

33:12.140 --> 33:17.900
But when you get self realization you start
getting these cool breeze as vibrations and

33:17.900 --> 33:24.820
your fingers become activated, finger tips
and on that you know all these centers as

33:24.820 --> 33:26.190
shown here.

33:26.190 --> 33:35.950
Now supposing you meet a cheat and he’s
very well dressed and you think he’s a very

33:35.950 --> 33:37.560
polished gentleman.

33:37.560 --> 33:42.420
But as soon as you put your hands towards
the person, immediately, you’ll find, fingers

33:42.420 --> 33:46.630
will be burning.

33:46.630 --> 33:50.580
Even in material things, you will feel the
vibrations.

33:50.580 --> 33:54.100
You will know what is good and what is bad.

33:54.100 --> 33:59.710
Like, many people take so many medicines blind
folded.

33:59.710 --> 34:06.690
After all, he must have told you, that in
Sahaja Yoga your health improves.

34:06.690 --> 34:10.770
You get in totality the benevolence.

34:10.770 --> 34:17.890
Like we have two doctors in Delhi, who already
have got MD in Sahaja Yoga and there are 400

34:17.890 --> 34:23.420
doctors in Russia who are practicing Sahaja
Yoga because you see, they’re very open

34:23.420 --> 34:25.010
minded people, like clean slates.

34:25.010 --> 34:28.730
They have no conditionings of religion or
anything on their heads.

34:28.730 --> 34:30.930
Very open minded people.

34:30.930 --> 34:34.090
So, your health improves.

34:34.090 --> 34:42.630
When your health improves, your mind improves,
your intellect improves, in every way you

34:42.630 --> 34:43.980
become so relaxed.

34:43.980 --> 34:53.420
Then you see any problem, whether material
or physical, mental, emotional, any problem,

34:53.420 --> 34:55.400
as if you are out of that problem.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.350
You see that problem.

34:57.350 --> 35:00.910
And when you see that problem you can solve
it better.

35:00.910 --> 35:04.110
On any level whats so ever.

35:04.110 --> 35:06.140
Its not at all complicated.

35:06.140 --> 35:10.300
Because we are complicated, we cannot solve
the problems.

35:10.300 --> 35:16.790
I would suggest like this, if you’re standing
in the water, you’re afraid of the waves

35:16.790 --> 35:20.530
but supposing you are in a boat, you can enjoy
those waves.

35:20.530 --> 35:30.590
But supposing if you become a master of swimming
you can jump and you can save so many people.

35:30.590 --> 35:36.210
These are the stages which you pass in Sahaja
Yoga and any subject, now we have people who,

35:36.210 --> 35:40.530
say, are running factories.

35:40.530 --> 35:45.410
Their factories were shut, they had strikes,
they had this problem, that problem.

35:45.410 --> 35:46.950
They are perfectly alright.

35:46.950 --> 35:53.400
They’re doing so well because the understanding
of totality comes to them.

35:53.400 --> 36:02.420
From small to big, from left to right, everything
you start knowing on your central nervous

36:02.420 --> 36:03.420
system.

36:03.420 --> 36:07.210
That’s how you solve the problem.

36:07.210 --> 36:09.790
Alright.

36:09.790 --> 36:14.520
For example, now in London, you must have
heard there’s so much of joblessness but

36:14.520 --> 36:16.170
not a single Sahaj Yogi.

36:16.170 --> 36:23.630
Once they come to Sahaja Yoga they have jobs
because they become so dynamic, they become

36:23.630 --> 36:37.600
so peaceful and faces start shining with that
joy and to find out one jobless person, who

36:37.600 --> 36:47.820
is a Sahaj Yogi in England, is a difficult
task.

36:47.820 --> 37:08.190
Question: What is happening in the hands?

37:08.190 --> 37:09.960
There’s a tingling.

37:09.960 --> 37:46.420
Shri Mataji: Ah, that means something, there’s
a problem, alright, there should be no tingling

37:46.420 --> 37:50.200
but if there’s a problem, we’ll correct
it.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.830
There’s tingling, there’s a problem.

37:52.830 --> 37:54.930
You should be corrected.

37:54.930 --> 38:01.690
Actually you should feel the cool breeze in
the hand, but sometimes you feel hot.

38:01.690 --> 38:05.240
That is, may be, due to liver also.

38:05.240 --> 38:07.760
You might feel hot but then it cools down.

38:07.760 --> 38:13.090
Ultimately you get the cool breeze.

38:13.090 --> 38:19.150
This kundalini moves, it passes through all
these centers, about this I’ll tell you

38:19.150 --> 38:21.440
tomorrow also, and nourishes all of them.

38:21.440 --> 38:34.690
By their nourishment you see it soothes you,
purifies those centers and you feel completely

38:34.690 --> 38:35.850
integrated.

38:35.850 --> 38:38.180
Completely relaxed.

38:38.180 --> 38:40.450
This is the real baptism.

38:40.450 --> 38:45.330
It’s not artificial because it breaks through,
this fontanelle bone area and you start feeling

38:45.330 --> 38:47.880
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out
of your head.

38:47.880 --> 38:49.150
It is an actualization.

38:49.150 --> 38:50.960
It is not just talking.

38:50.960 --> 38:53.600
It has to work out.

38:53.600 --> 39:13.270
Question: What shape and form does the subtle
body take?

39:13.270 --> 39:31.050
Shri Mataji: You see, the Spirit, is a reflection
of God Almighty on our heart.

39:31.050 --> 39:36.020
It’s an energy.

39:36.020 --> 39:43.500
So the subtle body, if you mean the Spirit,
it is, the light.

39:43.500 --> 39:53.500
Is in the form of light and this light, which
I will describe tomorrow, in full, how it

39:53.500 --> 39:58.130
acts.

39:58.130 --> 40:12.360
Question: How long it takes for self realization?

40:12.360 --> 40:14.860
Shri Mataji: Oh, it takes no time at all.

40:14.860 --> 40:17.280
It takes no time.

40:17.280 --> 40:22.020
There was a very great saint, called Ramadasa,
and somebody asked him, ‘How much time does

40:22.020 --> 40:24.210
it take for a Kundalini awakening?’

40:24.210 --> 40:26.930
He said, ‘Takshan’ ,’that moment!’

40:26.930 --> 40:33.410
But there should be a person deserving to
get it and the one who can give it.

40:33.410 --> 40:40.890
But today I must tell you, I’ve reached
a stage, I cannot explain how, thousands of

40:40.890 --> 40:42.960
them are getting realization.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.040
I went to Russia.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.210
They’ve never known me at all, nothing.

40:46.210 --> 40:48.440
First time I went there.

40:48.440 --> 40:53.000
They just saw my photograph and in thousands
they came.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.430
We had to book a stadium ultimately.

40:57.430 --> 41:02.580
Sixteen thousand, fourteen thousand and all
of them got realization.

41:02.580 --> 41:05.030
It has become like a religion with them.

41:05.030 --> 41:10.490
I mean how Sahaja Yoga has prospered in Russia,
is something, you cannot explain.

41:10.490 --> 41:12.320
You cannot explain.

41:12.320 --> 41:16.830
See, it hardly takes anytime.

41:16.830 --> 41:21.040
This is a jet age and the Kundalini also works
like a jet.

41:21.040 --> 41:23.980
You don’t even feel the rising.

41:23.980 --> 41:26.690
In some people you do, if there is an obstruction.

41:26.690 --> 41:32.260
Otherwise suddenly you start feeling the cool
breeze and the cool breeze in your hand but

41:32.260 --> 41:34.720
you don’t doubt yourself.

41:34.720 --> 41:35.720
That’s one thing.

41:35.720 --> 41:36.720
We go on doubting.

41:36.720 --> 41:41.050
How can I get it?

41:41.050 --> 41:45.590
This and that.

41:45.590 --> 41:50.130
Please don’t doubt.

41:50.130 --> 41:55.050
Question: Are there workshops following this
program tomorrow?

41:55.050 --> 42:02.330
[There was no program the next day which Shri
Mataji was unaware of]

42:02.330 --> 42:04.350
Shri Mataji: Not tomorrow?

42:04.350 --> 42:05.510
Oh my!

42:05.510 --> 42:09.680
I thought, Oh I’m sorry, I would have said
something more.

42:09.680 --> 42:10.680
Oh!

42:10.680 --> 42:14.700
I thought there is a program tomorrow also.

42:14.700 --> 42:19.200
(Talking to a yogi, ‘Why not?

42:19.200 --> 42:25.450
I mean such nice people here.

42:25.450 --> 42:30.660
Would be better if you could organize something
tomorrow, may be.

42:30.660 --> 42:33.430
I am not going tomorrow evening, am I?’)

42:33.430 --> 42:39.190
They fix me like a plug you know from one
place to another.

42:39.190 --> 42:43.120
I don’t know, I didn’t know there’s
only program here.

42:43.120 --> 42:49.040
I’m sorry about it.

42:49.040 --> 42:53.840
Normally always I have two days.

42:53.840 --> 42:54.840
It doesn’t matter.

42:54.840 --> 42:59.450
As long as you get your realization, you have
to work it out.

42:59.450 --> 43:01.980
It works out and you’ll know each and everything.

43:01.980 --> 43:03.660
You’ll become a master.

43:03.660 --> 43:06.690
Master of this.

43:06.690 --> 43:16.340
You can give realization to others.

43:16.340 --> 43:32.200
Question: Why do you talk of God as a man?

43:32.200 --> 43:34.710
Shri Mataji: I’m a woman here.

43:34.710 --> 43:42.110
You should know that between God and His power
there is no quarrel.

43:42.110 --> 43:47.520
His power is the Holy Ghost is a Woman, no
doubt.

43:47.520 --> 43:53.970
In india we call Her as Adi Shakti, is the
primordial Mother.

43:53.970 --> 44:00.380
Like the moon and moonlight, the sun and the
sunlight are not two different things.

44:00.380 --> 44:05.900
Only in human life we think like a man and
a woman, like that, but do you know, the woman

44:05.900 --> 44:07.390
is the power of man.

44:07.390 --> 44:15.650
There’s no quarrel between the two.

44:15.650 --> 44:26.690
Actually, God is just a spectator and the
primordial Mother does all the job, He’s

44:26.690 --> 44:33.530
just a spectator and when He doesn’t like
it, He just finishes the whole thing.

44:33.530 --> 44:35.670
He cancels.

44:35.670 --> 44:51.440
He’s the one who is watching, how the children
of the Mother are going to behave.

44:51.440 --> 44:52.440
They do not quarrel.

44:52.440 --> 45:02.530
They don’t go for divorce, nothing of the
kind.

45:02.530 --> 45:10.090
Actually this concept, never came into Christianity
somehow of the Mother and it was played down

45:10.090 --> 45:14.570
very much by Mr Paul who just came into Bible
somehow or the other.

45:14.570 --> 45:20.950
I don’t know why he was there and he didn’t
even want to accept the immaculate conception

45:20.950 --> 45:23.080
as one of the truths.

45:23.080 --> 45:33.730
And he fought with all these disciples and
he found a very good platform ready for him

45:33.730 --> 45:41.380
because he was just a officer with the Romans
and he had killed also, one disciple of Christ

45:41.380 --> 45:43.380
called Steven.

45:43.380 --> 45:45.700
But he just jumped on the stage and he took
over.

45:45.700 --> 45:56.160
And then even, I think, he was born as Augustine
and they ruined Christianity completely.

45:56.160 --> 45:57.660
Completely!

45:57.660 --> 46:05.180
And it has reached such a horrible state,
specially among protestants now, they have

46:05.180 --> 46:10.050
made a, kind of a mental, their approach,
to such a limit, to say that Christ was a

46:10.050 --> 46:11.050
homosexual!

46:11.050 --> 46:52.970
Or to say that, these horrible things, that
really, I don’t want to just say also.

46:52.970 --> 46:55.980
So should we have now.

46:55.980 --> 47:07.960
Self realization all of us.

47:07.960 --> 47:17.540
There are two conditions.

47:17.540 --> 47:25.970
The first one is, to have full confidence
in yourself.

47:25.970 --> 47:30.020
Those people who tell you, you are sinners
and you have done this wrong and you are all

47:30.020 --> 47:36.330
the time guilty about something, I’ve to
make a very humble request that you should

47:36.330 --> 47:42.680
know that you are a human being, not God and
a human being is the only one who can make

47:42.680 --> 47:43.680
mistakes.

47:43.680 --> 47:50.030
Animals never think that they make mistakes
because they are completely under the control

47:50.030 --> 47:52.950
of God and God’s never make mistakes.

47:52.950 --> 47:57.800
It’s only human beings who are capable of
making mistakes.

47:57.800 --> 48:02.070
So there is no need to feel guilty or call
yourself sinners or anything.

48:02.070 --> 48:07.740
Those who call you sinners itself must be
greatest sinners, I think.

48:07.740 --> 48:13.130
Every human being has a right to become divine.

48:13.130 --> 48:15.460
So please forgive yourself.

48:15.460 --> 48:24.500
Forgot all the past at this moment and know
that you are the Spirit.

48:24.500 --> 48:27.680
You are not guilty at all, of, for anything.

48:27.680 --> 48:28.680
Just give up all the guilt.

48:28.680 --> 48:32.250
It’s also a fashion to have guilt.

48:32.250 --> 48:36.360
Even for small small things, you see, our
modern life has so many norms.

48:36.360 --> 48:38.230
Like one gentleman was very upset.

48:38.230 --> 48:41.560
So I said, ‘what’s the matter?’

48:41.560 --> 48:43.940
‘I spilled coffee on my dress.’

48:43.940 --> 48:44.940
‘What is there?

48:44.940 --> 48:45.940
Doesn’t matter!

48:45.940 --> 48:48.460
If coffee is there, it has to spill also.’

48:48.460 --> 48:53.010
Such a small nonsensical thing, he couldn’t
sleep for the whole night.

48:53.010 --> 48:59.980
One has to know these are all very very simple
things on which we should not worry our heads

48:59.980 --> 49:12.460
and we have to get into that area where we
will enjoy ourselves.

49:12.460 --> 49:14.270
So forget about it.

49:14.270 --> 49:18.290
Just forget and just don’t feel guilty.

49:18.290 --> 49:19.440
Not to feel guilty.

49:19.440 --> 49:21.520
Is the first condition.

49:21.520 --> 49:30.970
The second condition is that, you have to
forgive everyone.

49:30.970 --> 49:35.630
Now you may say that, ‘it’s very difficult
Mother to forgive everyone.’

49:35.630 --> 49:37.520
But just think logically.

49:37.520 --> 49:41.930
Whether you forgive or you don’t forgive,
you don’t do anything.

49:41.930 --> 49:43.530
What do you do?

49:43.530 --> 49:45.680
You don’t do anything.

49:45.680 --> 49:47.460
It’s a myth.

49:47.460 --> 49:54.480
But if you don’t forgive, then you play
into wrong hands and you torture yourself

49:54.480 --> 50:01.440
while the person who has tortured you, is
quite happy.

50:01.440 --> 50:04.000
So you have to forgive in general.

50:04.000 --> 50:08.610
Don’t think of each and every person individually.

50:08.610 --> 50:19.880
Just forgive everyone, in such a manner that
you say to yourself ‘I forgive ALL of them.’

50:19.880 --> 50:24.250
And you’ll feel very light after that.

50:24.250 --> 50:25.500
You’ll see.

50:25.500 --> 50:28.000
You’ll feel much better.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.530
Just forgive.

50:29.530 --> 50:30.530
Forgive everyone.

50:30.530 --> 50:32.910
This is the second condition.

50:32.910 --> 50:34.930
That’s all!

50:34.930 --> 50:44.550
Now to go about it, is very simple, we have
to take the help of the Mother Earth a little

50:44.550 --> 50:45.550
bit.

50:45.550 --> 50:53.080
So if you could take out your shoes for a
while, not the socks but the shoes and put

50:53.080 --> 50:56.600
both the feet apart from each other.

50:56.600 --> 51:03.080
Just imagine sitting on the chair, anywhere,
you get your self realization.

51:03.080 --> 51:09.260
It’s so simple!

51:09.260 --> 51:22.390
Even in my lecture, if I’ve said something
which might have made you feel guilty, please

51:22.390 --> 51:23.630
forget the lecture also.

51:23.630 --> 51:25.360
Just forget it.

51:25.360 --> 51:31.590
Not to feel guilty is very important because
when you feel guilty you spoil the centre

51:31.590 --> 51:35.350
here, on the left hand side (Shri Mataji puts
her hand on left visuddhi) and this causes

51:35.350 --> 51:37.990
a horrible disease called Angina.

51:37.990 --> 51:46.360
Also it causes Spondylitis and many other
lethargic organs diseases.

51:46.360 --> 51:57.190
So why do you want to have all these things
just for a myth of a guilt?

51:57.190 --> 52:04.030
Specially Australians are, I think, I don’t
know why they have a guilt but Australians

52:04.030 --> 52:05.500
should not have any guilt at all.

52:05.500 --> 52:06.500
For what?

52:06.500 --> 52:11.840
You never went into any war, nothing, you
have settled down here far away from the mad

52:11.840 --> 52:12.840
world.

52:12.840 --> 52:19.570
So why should you have any guilt?

52:19.570 --> 52:24.590
Alright, so now you have to put both your
feet apart from each other because, left and

52:24.590 --> 52:28.040
right, as he must’ve told you, are two powers.

52:28.040 --> 52:40.070
One is the power of desire, normal desire
and another one is the power of action.

52:40.070 --> 52:44.180
This one works for the desire (gestures left)
and this one for the action (gestures right).

52:44.180 --> 52:46.540
So we’ll be using both our hands.

52:46.540 --> 52:47.760
He’ll show you how.

52:47.760 --> 52:54.750
First you see and you will, yourself activate
your own kundalini.

52:54.750 --> 52:57.340
First you put your left hand towards me like
this.

52:57.340 --> 52:59.040
He’ll show you.

52:59.040 --> 53:00.360
Please keep your eyes open just now.

53:00.360 --> 53:05.470
Then you can close later on when we’ll have
the real procedure.

53:05.470 --> 53:07.720
Just put the left hand like this.

53:07.720 --> 53:08.720
Be comfortable.

53:08.720 --> 53:13.410
You shouldn’t bend or you shouldn’t push
yourself back too much but sit comfortably.

53:13.410 --> 53:15.630
Be comfortable.

53:15.630 --> 53:26.050
Now please put the left hand like this – this
is symbolic that you want to have your realization.

53:26.050 --> 53:34.610
And you have to put your right hand on your
different centers, symbolic of the action

53:34.610 --> 53:36.960
that you are taking.

53:36.960 --> 53:42.330
Actually it is no action but you are nourishing
your centers by placing your hand on these

53:42.330 --> 53:44.330
different centers.

53:44.330 --> 53:48.060
So you put your right hand on your heart.

53:48.060 --> 53:49.810
It’s very good.

53:49.810 --> 53:52.250
All of you should do it.

53:52.250 --> 54:01.840
Please put your right hand on your heart.

54:01.840 --> 54:12.540
In the heart I’ve told you is the reflection
of God Almighty, the Spirit.

54:12.540 --> 54:15.360
We’ll be working only on the left hand side.

54:15.360 --> 54:28.820
We take our right hand now on the upper portion
of our abdomen on the left hand side.

54:28.820 --> 54:31.930
This is the centre of your mastery.

54:31.930 --> 54:40.980
The mastery of yoga by which you yourself
can give realization to others.

54:40.980 --> 54:49.420
And this centre was created by great prophets
and great saints.

54:49.420 --> 55:00.630
Then we take our hand onto the lower portion
of our abdomen on the left hand side and press

55:00.630 --> 55:02.490
it hard.

55:02.490 --> 55:06.600
This is the centre of pure knowledge.

55:06.600 --> 55:07.600
Of pure knowledge.

55:07.600 --> 55:17.180
Pure knowledge is the knowledge which gives
you the full understanding or gives, empowers

55:17.180 --> 55:21.680
you, to work out the divine power.

55:21.680 --> 55:27.400
That’s the pure knowledge.

55:27.400 --> 55:39.930
Then you raise your hand again back, on the
right side of your abdomen in the upper portion

55:39.930 --> 55:42.240
and press it hard.

55:42.240 --> 55:47.460
This is again is the principal of mastery,
‘Guru tattwa’ as they call it.

55:47.460 --> 55:58.240
Then again you raise your right hand on your
heart.

55:58.240 --> 56:04.410
Now you place your right hand in the corner
of your neck and your shoulder.

56:04.410 --> 56:07.090
Place it back.

56:07.090 --> 56:09.110
As far as possible.

56:09.110 --> 56:12.830
This is very important.

56:12.830 --> 56:23.000
This centre as I told you is, if in jeopardy,
then you get horrible diseases.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.000
Now turn your head to your right.

56:26.000 --> 56:30.740
This is the centre where you have to say you
are not guilty.

56:30.740 --> 56:34.370
This we’ll do later on.

56:34.370 --> 56:40.640
Now please take your right hand on top of
your forehead across.

56:40.640 --> 56:49.110
Press it like this and put down your head
fully on it.

56:49.110 --> 56:54.660
This is the centre.

56:54.660 --> 57:08.060
Now, here you bend your head and here you
have to forgive everyone.

57:08.060 --> 57:13.950
This is the centre of Christ.

57:13.950 --> 57:18.360
One window of that centre we can call, is
in the front.

57:18.360 --> 57:21.820
Another one is on the back.

57:21.820 --> 57:25.290
Where you put your right hand on the backside
of your head.

57:25.290 --> 57:27.060
Backside of your head.

57:27.060 --> 57:32.530
Press back your head, as far as possible.

57:32.530 --> 57:44.300
Here is the centre where, for your own satisfaction,
without feeling guilty you have to ask forgiveness

57:44.300 --> 57:47.480
from the divine, if you have done any mistakes.

57:47.480 --> 57:49.420
Is for only your satisfaction.

57:49.420 --> 57:55.760
You don’t have to feel guilty about it or
think about your own mistakes.

57:55.760 --> 57:56.760
Just you have to ask.

57:56.760 --> 58:00.580
Please push back your head.

58:00.580 --> 58:11.920
Now, please stretch your right hand fully
and put the centre of your palm exactly on

58:11.920 --> 58:16.660
the fontanelle bone area, which was a soft
bone in your childhood.

58:16.660 --> 58:19.360
Press it nicely.

58:19.360 --> 58:25.240
Push back your fingers, put down your head
as much as you can.

58:25.240 --> 58:28.910
Put down your head and now press it hard.

58:28.910 --> 58:36.070
This is the last centre and now start moving
your scalp with a big pressure.

58:36.070 --> 58:37.180
Push back your fingers.

58:37.180 --> 58:38.400
Very important.

58:38.400 --> 58:41.440
Move it 7 times.

58:41.440 --> 58:47.900
You will know why 7 times and why it is so
many times.

58:47.900 --> 58:49.460
Clockwise.

58:49.460 --> 58:51.020
Slowly.

58:51.020 --> 59:00.400
That’s all you have to do.

59:00.400 --> 59:03.520
That’s all.

59:03.520 --> 59:08.820
Now, we have to close our eyes.

59:08.820 --> 59:11.390
Before that I would say, you can take out
your glasses.

59:11.390 --> 59:13.730
It might help your eyesight.

59:13.730 --> 59:27.010
You don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

59:27.010 --> 59:33.130
If you have anything tight around your neck
or around your waist, you can make it little

59:33.130 --> 59:36.820
loose because, may be, it might make you uncomfortable.

59:36.820 --> 59:39.500
If it is not making you uncomfortable it’s
alright.

59:39.500 --> 59:44.760
So now you have sit little straight, that’s
all, not too much strain on your back.

59:44.760 --> 59:46.940
But in a straight way.

59:46.940 --> 59:53.990
And now please put your left hand towards
me and right hand on your heart and now please

59:53.990 --> 59:57.730
close your eyes.

59:57.730 --> 01:00:03.320
As I told you, you have to desire for self
realization.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:07.750
I cannot force on you.

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:12.850
Now here you have to say or ask a question
to me.

01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:17.220
You can call me ‘Mother’ or ‘Shri Mataji,’
whatever you feel like.

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:23.610
‘Mother, am I the Spirit?’

01:00:23.610 --> 01:00:31.230
Like a computer you’re asking a question
because you have to become a divine computer.

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:35.730
Where the whole programming is within yourself.

01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:51.550
So now ask a question 3 times ‘Mother, am
I the Spirit?’

01:00:51.550 --> 01:00:59.500
In your heart.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:08.190
Now, if you are the Spirit, you are your master.

01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:17.050
So please take down your right hand in the
upper portion of your abdomen.

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:18.440
On the left hand side.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.380
Keep the left hand towards me and both the
feet apart.

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:24.540
Please don’t open your eyes till I tell
you.

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:32.360
Now here, you ask me another question 3 times,
‘Mother, am I my own master?’Ask this

01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:36.620
question 3 times in your heart.

01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:42.430
Do not doubt yourself.

01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:46.610
You have to know that I cannot force pure
knowledge on you.

01:01:46.610 --> 01:01:48.430
You have your own freedom.

01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:51.280
If you don’t want it, I cannot do it.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.690
So you have to ask for it.

01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:59.780
So now you can put your right hand in the
lower portion of your abdomen, on the left

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:02.010
hand side and press it hard.

01:02:02.010 --> 01:02:11.520
And here you have to say, ‘Mother, please
give me pure knowledge.’

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:18.350
‘Shri Mataji, give me please pure knowledge.’

01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:32.900
You have to say this 6 times because this
centre has got 6 petals.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:42.460
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the
kundalini starts moving upward.

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:53.310
So we have to just nourish the upper centers
with our self confidence.

01:02:53.310 --> 01:03:02.460
Sow now please, raise your right hand in the
upper portion of your abdomen on the left

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:06.750
hand side.

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:20.810
Here you have to say with full confidence,10
times,‘Mother, I am my own master.’

01:03:20.810 --> 01:03:38.940
Say it with full confidence, ‘Mother, I
am my own master.’

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:45.750
Say it sincerely and with self confidence.

01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:55.020
I’ve already told you at the very outset
that the truth about, is that, you are not

01:03:55.020 --> 01:04:09.590
this body, not this mind, not this ego nor
these conditionings but you are the pure Spirit.

01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:18.080
So now please raise your right hand on your
heart.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:30.340
And here you say with full confidence again,12
times,

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:37.070
‘Mother, I am the Spirit.’

01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:51.920
Please say it 12 times.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:59.660
I’ve already told you that you are not God.

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:08.070
You are a human being and if you have done
any mistakes, there’s nothing to worry about

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:10.160
it.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:14.770
So do not feel guilty.

01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:28.510
At this present moment you better forget the
past and completely forgive yourself.

01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:39.590
Now place your right hand in the corner of
your shoulder and your neck.

01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:41.550
And turn your head to your right.

01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:53.760
Here you have to say with full confidence
in yourself, 16 times, ‘Mother, I am not

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.470
guilty at all.’

01:05:55.470 --> 01:06:13.850
Please say, 16 times, ‘Mother, I am not
guilty at all.’

01:06:13.850 --> 01:06:33.460
Now, we have to know that this divine power
is the ocean of love, ocean of knowledge,

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:45.800
ocean of joy but above all, it is the ocean
of forgiveness and whatever mistakes we commit,

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:59.460
it can be dissolved into this great power
of ocean of forgiveness.

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:09.330
Now raise your right hand onto your forehead
across and put down your head on it.

01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:21.270
Here as I told you, you have to say, ‘Mother,
I forgive everyone in general.’

01:07:21.270 --> 01:07:29.450
As I have explained to you that whether you
forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do

01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:34.090
anything but if you don’t forgive, you play
into wrong hands.

01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:44.120
So please say it, from your heart.

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:58.350
Not how many times, say it, from your heart,
‘Mother, I forgive everyone.’

01:07:58.350 --> 01:08:07.200
Now without feeling guilty, without counting
your mistakes, just for your satisfaction,

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:12.370
you have to ask for forgiveness from the divine
power.

01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:18.190
So now please put your right hand on the backside
of your head and push back your head as far

01:08:18.190 --> 01:08:21.140
as possible.

01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:32.670
Here you have to
say with full confidence, without feeling

01:08:32.670 --> 01:08:39.580
guilty, without counting your mistakes, ‘O
divine power, if I have done any mistakes,

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:42.860
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me.’

01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:44.900
Say it again, from your heart.

01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:47.270
It’s not important how many times.

01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:56.680
From your heart!

01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:17.740
Now, stretch your hand, fully, right hand
and put the centre of your palm on top of

01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:23.790
your head, on the fontanelle bone area, which
was a soft bone in your childhood.Now, put

01:09:23.790 --> 01:09:25.370
it down.

01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:32.180
Put it down as much as you can.

01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:34.160
Put down your head.

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:37.090
Now, push back your fingers.

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:38.590
Push back your fingers.

01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:43.220
So there’s lot of pressure on the scalp.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:49.750
Here again, I cannot force self realization
on you.

01:09:49.750 --> 01:09:52.440
You have to ask for it.

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:55.920
I respect your freedom.

01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:09.160
So please, move your hand 7 times, clockwise,
slowly, saying 7 times, ‘Mother, please

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:11.790
give me self realization.’

01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:18.780
Please say it 7 times, ‘Mother, please give
me self realization.’

01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:22.310
Now put the hand properly.

01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:24.750
This is a very important procedure.

01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:28.820
Put the hand properly on the fontanelle bone
area.

01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.960
Put down your head.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:11:25.500
Press it hard and move it very slowly, clockwise.

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:33.220
Now please take down your hands.

01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:39.370
Now please put both your hands towards me
like this and watch me without thinking.

01:11:39.370 --> 01:11:43.770
Both the hands towards me.

01:11:43.770 --> 01:11:51.040
Now, the right hand you put like this, bend
your head and see for yourself if there’s

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:55.240
a cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle
bone area.

01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:02.150
Now hold the hand, above, not on top of your
head, and see for your, bend your head.

01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:08.610
See for yourself with your left hand if there’s
a cool breeze or a hot breeze in some cases,

01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:10.740
is coming out of your own head.

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.100
You have to certify yourself.

01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.830
Now bend your head.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.540
Please bend your head.

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:18.150
Please bend your head, bend it.

01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:20.300
Bending will help you better.

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:21.300
Now concentrate.

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:23.220
Don’t put it on top.

01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:28.800
Some people get it quite far away and move
your hand all over to see if there’s a cool

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:35.210
breeze coming out of it.

01:12:35.210 --> 01:12:44.110
Now, please take the left hand like this.

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:47.380
Put the left hand towards me.

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:55.840
Now again, bend your head and please see with
your right hand if there’s cool breeze or

01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:01.630
a hot breeze or heat coming out of your head.

01:13:01.630 --> 01:13:03.550
Please see.

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:06.460
Move your hand.

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:14.670
Some people get it very far also.

01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:28.730
Now, please put your right hand towards me
and again with the left hand, bend your head

01:13:28.730 --> 01:13:35.680
and again see for yourself.

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:45.630
Now, push back both your hands towards the
sky.

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:49.150
Both your hands towards the sky.

01:13:49.150 --> 01:14:01.190
Push back your head completely and ask a question
3 times, ‘Mother, is this the all pervading

01:14:01.190 --> 01:14:21.150
power of God’s love?’Just ask this question
3 times.

01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:24.070
Please take down both your hands.

01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:35.770
Push both the hands towards me and watch me
without thinking.This is the first stage which

01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:43.300
we call in Sanskrit as ‘Nirvichar Samadhi’
and in English it is ‘thoughtless awareness’

01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:46.080
where there is no thought.

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:49.870
So you have crossed this and you have crossed
this also.

01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:55.670
But it is to be established still further,
in a proper way.

01:14:55.670 --> 01:15:03.090
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze
out of their heads or on their fingers, on

01:15:03.090 --> 01:15:11.070
their hands, please raise both your hands.

01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:18.760
Imagine the whole of Perth has felt it, practically!

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:22.360
May God Bless You!

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:27.780
Some of you have not felt.

01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:29.590
Doesn’t matter.

01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:30.590
It will work out.

01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:32.340
Maybe, you must be thinking about something.

01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:38.720
I don’t know what happened.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:46.950
So now we have to know that we have got the
first breakthrough but this connection has

01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:49.840
to be fully established.

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:56.720
Has to be fully manifested within our being.

01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:02.050
So whatever we have achieved, we have to work
it out in such a manner that we know what

01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:05.990
it is.

01:16:05.990 --> 01:16:09.320
I would like to meet you because I may not
be able to meet you tomorrow.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:10.850
I’m so sorry.

01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:18.750
So if you can come around, I would like to
meet you and talk to you about it. May God Bless You! Thank you!
