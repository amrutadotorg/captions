1
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,830
To see so many Sahaja Yogis assembled here, I’m
sure the devil must have run away long time

2
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:37,729
back. And the caravan must have left but I
hope we are aware of it and we forget about

3
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:46,819
our fears of our catches, of our past, of
all the nonsense we have done so far. Suddenly

4
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:59,840
in My presence, I think, people get into a
sense of guilt. I’m here to soothe you,

5
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:13,940
to cleanse you, to make you beautiful and
not to feel guilty.

6
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:33,599
Actually when we start 
looking at ourselves the first thing you notice
is that there’s a block on the Agnya, but

7
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:40,230
this block in the Agnya is the worst thing
that can happen to us because it is the door

8
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:47,040
of the Kundalini. She reaches up to Vishuddhi
all right, and then She has to move forward,

9
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:58,000
this Agnya stops it. That’s why we have
left Vishuddhi, we have all 
the Vishuddhi problems. The flow cannot take

10
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:11,110
place. Also this is one of the reasons we
feel guilty because of left Vishuddhi. It’s

11
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,340
a symptom of a disease.

12
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:20,920
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna.
So we have to understand first of all that

13
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:27,880
we’re Sahaja Yogis. We’re not ordinary
people or we’re not people who have not

14
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:34,310
known the truth; we have known the truth.
We have to be completely aware of it. That’s

15
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,940
one truth if you establish, you have established
yourself quite a lot.

16
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:50,370
Now the ordinary people as you have seen on
Oxford St., you see, they wear Indian dresses

17
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,500
funnily tied, they don’t know how to tie
it up, dhotis and saris and they shake their

18
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:07,910
heads and buy some of these, what we call
them, shindis or bodhis or I don’t know

19
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:19,410
what you call, tails, pigtails, and attach
them with some glue and they start dancing.

20
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:32,720
When they dance, their pigtail falls off,
and the saris and the dhotis, everything start

21
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,539
opening out. That’s a very funny, ridiculous
scene. One side you see the punks and another

22
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:45,120
side you see this nonsense, in the name of
Shri Krishna, that’s even worse. Punks do

23
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,090
not do it in the name of, I don’t know if
they do it in the name of King Solomon. But

24
00:04:52,090 --> 00:05:00,010
they do it in somebody’s name, these people
that is so great as Shri Krishna. On the contrary,

25
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:22,880
Shri Krishna’s hair are described in all
the books and in all the poetry that poets

26
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,130
could sing about. He was never shaven-headed.
It is impossible to understand how these people

27
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:36,860
got the idea that you must shave your head.
So the Shri Krishna’s aspect of Yogeshwara

28
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:46,970
has been so misunderstood. It’s absolutely
misunderstood because we cannot understand

29
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:55,660
that the truth is covered with maya, always.
And you should keep maya on one side and go

30
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,479
to the truth. Instead of that, we get lost
in the maya, like very simple example, as

31
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:07,050
it is, that He is a Yogeshwara; so these people
have idea of a yogi, that He should be shaven,

32
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:13,550
He should wear that dhoti, dirty one, and
must put on a pigtail. Another concept, maya

33
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:20,610
is a concept. And when you start living on
those concepts of your own, you may gather

34
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,210
it up with something else, you may think that
Christ was a person who was a sanyasi, who

35
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:31,470
used to wear another kind of a robe and He
had a beard and He had hair like this.

36
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:40,270
All those ideas, “So if we become like this,
we’d be very great yogis.” These are all

37
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:47,430
our concepts about someone whom we have never
seen, whom we have never known. And because

38
00:06:47,430 --> 00:07:00,080
we live with those concepts, we get limited.
It’s very difficult for these people to

39
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,300
break through because maya can only be broken
through realization. That’s why first thing

40
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,910
in Sahaja Yoga is realization. Take your realization.
You are a drunkard, all right, get your realization.

41
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:17,479
You are a drug addict, get your realization.
You are a bad man, get your realization. Anyone,

42
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:26,060
get your realization first; put the light
first into a person. Let him see for himself.

43
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:36,000
So all this identification with different
concepts is responsible for giving us a very

44
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:46,139
mayami or illusive personality. We live in
an illusive personality, live with it, enjoy

45
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:59,830
it and we think we are perfectly all right.
Now if you are aware you are Sahaja Yogis

46
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:08,720
and you have come here for Shri Krishna Puja,
what is the preparation we have to do. We’re

47
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,880
Sahaja Yogis, we know about Kundalini, we
know about Vishuddhis, we know about Shri

48
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:25,580
Krishna. All right, how are we going to prepare
ourselves for the puja of Shri Krishna?

49
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:38,610
First of all, He tried to break all the concepts.
First the concept He broke was that you have

50
00:08:38,610 --> 00:09:00,699
to be like a ascetic to look. He broke this
concept; He lived like the king. In His childhood

51
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:15,019
He used to go and play with the cows. And
there He would use a peacock’s feather to

52
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:30,839
decorate Himself, and He would listen to beautiful
music of the river Yamuna and reproduce it.

53
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:44,749
He was leelala, He was the one who created
all kinds of mirth. What is mirth in French?

54
00:09:44,749 --> 00:10:00,910
They don’t have mirth, I believe. It’s
not fun, it’s more than… , it’s mirth.

55
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:25,879
Mirth is sweeter than fun, all right, sweet
fun. What a word! Sweet fun! This is mirth,

56
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:37,720
now what is happening to you is mirth. I’m
creating mirth in which you feel tickled,

57
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,040
you know. Mirth is something where you feel
tickled.

58
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:55,569
So He tried to create mirth, never seriousness
but He was not frivolous. He was Yogeshwara.

59
00:10:55,569 --> 00:11:09,619
He was not frivolous, so this difference between
frivolity and mirth is to be understood only

60
00:11:09,619 --> 00:11:30,809
through Him because He’s also discretion.
Mirth is joy-giving, frivolity is destructive.

61
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:52,779
Anything frivolous if you do…
So we have to be in a state of mirth, so no

62
00:11:52,779 --> 00:12:00,589
question of feeling guilty comes in, you’re
not prisoners are we? We’re prisoners of

63
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:11,339
our own concepts and our own ideas and our
own degradation. We degrade ourselves, God

64
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:23,889
does not. So we should be in the state of
complete mirth and enjoyment. Now it has rained,

65
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:37,129
all right. That’s a very good thing to happen
today. Yesterday I was listening to the program,

66
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:48,779
I was just smiling, because I knew it would
not work out that way.

67
00:12:48,779 --> 00:13:01,079
And in India, on this day, when they celebrate
in the morning, children of the village or

68
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:15,449
children of the particular areas gather together.
And for them the house-holders tie a little

69
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:24,230
pitcher, which we call as a matka, and in
that there is money, anything valuable they

70
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:33,489
want to give to the children, sweets, everything
put inside, and is tied up in the air. Normally

71
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:40,350
it rains, if it doesn’t rain then they pour
water on the children to make them feel it’s

72
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:51,889
raining. Rain is very much connected with
Shri Krishna. So the children come and they

73
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:59,929
go in a way that the taller boys are first,
then smaller, then smaller like a pyramid

74
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:06,459
they go up till at the end there’s one boy
who’s sort of representing Shri Krishna

75
00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:14,299
and then he breaks that. And from there everything
falls down and flowers, everything on them,

76
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:23,019
they take the money, they take all those things
and start enjoying. Then they go to another

77
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:31,419
place, the whole day they are moving in the
city like that and every good house-holder

78
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:43,329
ties that matka for these children, for them
to come and enjoy themselves. That’s in

79
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:51,389
the real sense, is the Krishna Astami in Gokul
where He lived as a child.

80
00:14:51,389 --> 00:15:08,779
Now why is He so much connected with rain?
Once all His friends and He were looking after

81
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:23,139
the cows and Indra felt that He is very powerful,
somehow, I don’t know, He gets into jealousies

82
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:46,519
sometimes. And He sent rain to test His patience,
His leela, His play, His mirth. It rained

83
00:15:46,519 --> 00:16:00,929
and rained and rained and they did not know
what to do. So there was a mountain called

84
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:10,129
Govardhan. Shri Krishna lifted it with His
stick or His finger and just put it up on

85
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:18,410
top of His finger, like that. That’s why
He is called as Govardhan Dhari. And the whole

86
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:30,239
mountain was on top and all the children joined
Him and now the cows and He asked the children,

87
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:40,229
“You also put your sticks up to help.”
And they all put their sticks and standing

88
00:16:40,229 --> 00:16:56,079
very sweetly holding the Govardhan. That is
one of His names, Govardhan Dhari.

89
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:03,959
So the rain had to come and the cows with
their bells have to remind us. Imagine the

90
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:13,120
lake has a name which is a black; Krishna
means black, Krishna word itself means black.

91
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:24,280
How Sahaj the whole thing has worked out.
Can you see the coincidences are so Sahaj

92
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:42,120
but are so . And here we are sitting, it’s
raining, nicely enjoying everything. But on

93
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:56,700
the contrary when we start not enjoying we
play into, either into our ego or superego.

94
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:12,730
Supposing we are starved people, tortured
people, then we start making others like ourselves.

95
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:25,519
We like to make them suffer and torture them.
That’s why I always say, “Poverty is leprosy.”

96
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:31,610
Anybody who is in poverty can develop horrible
things within themselves. It is never to be

97
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,120
sided with, not to be sympathized but to be
completely eradicated.

98
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:46,139
Another side is the ego where we try to dominate
others and enjoy that. There’s no joy, there’s

99
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:54,940
no joy in dominating others and saying things
to others. I was sorry to hear yesterday that

100
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,179
there are some girls who are married, some
Indian girls who are married and their husbands

101
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:06,130
are not respecting them and troubling them.
It hurt Me very much. That shows they’re

102
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:13,870
so low level people, very low level. Such
a mediocracy, such useless people. They should

103
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:22,870
have never come to Sahaja Yoga and deceived
us like this. They will go to hell direct,

104
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,830
I can tell you this.

105
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:33,840
Now there are some who are caught up with
their superego; they suffer from some sort

106
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:47,950
of a funny Sahaja Yoga schizophrenia. And
they don’t want to get rid or it. They just

107
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:53,190
don’t want to understand that they’re
not normal people, they have to be perfectly

108
00:19:53,190 --> 00:20:05,940
all right. They make everyone miserable, jump
on to all the places where they should not

109
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:13,340
be. Like a person who has got, say, example,
tuberculosis, a disease which is contagious.

110
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:22,630
Must understand he has got tuberculosis, keep
out, don’t give it to others, at least.

111
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:30,929
But those who have got badhas will definitely
come, either they’ll give big lectures.

112
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:41,889
I start seeing them like big bhoots speaking,
or if not they have badhas then they will

113
00:20:41,889 --> 00:20:45,460
come at a place where they should not be.
They’ll put their hands in the prasada,

114
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:52,220
they’ll be sitting in the puja in the front,
all kinds of things they’ll be doing, catching

115
00:20:52,220 --> 00:21:05,500
people. And they enjoy it because they are
identified with the badhas. How will they

116
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,389
improve?

117
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:15,350
There’s one fellow who is a bhootish fellow,
we have had him for, I think, for at least

118
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:23,809
for a century I should say, and he’s giving
lectures to others, “You must clean the

119
00:21:23,809 --> 00:21:33,960
shoes of all the Sahaja Yogis to get rid of
your ego.” So such a gross, depraved and

120
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:44,129
low level people are still in Sahaja Yoga.
So the enjoyment of Sahaja Yoga becomes less.

121
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:58,399
If you eat rice with stones in it, how will
you enjoy it? And that’s what it is.

122
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:11,100
We are here to enjoy the blessings of God,
to have the mirth but still we are living

123
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:24,700
with all joy-killing things that we have.
How are we going to get rid of those things.

124
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:35,210
So at least we do not become thorns in the
lives of others. So the so-called free will,

125
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:40,200
I’m happy Rustom has told you about it,
is nothing but your ego and superego because

126
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:53,120
you’re not in the center. In the center,
you have nothing but freedom, that’s all,

127
00:22:53,120 --> 00:23:03,759
nothing but freedom; nothing like free will,
freedom, complete freedom. There’s nothing

128
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:19,940
like will or nothing like bhoots, nothing
like bondage, it’s entire avenue of freedom.

129
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:41,049
Then this freedom is the knowledge, this freedom
is the love, this freedom is the discretion.

130
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:51,720
Then you say God gives you freedom and others
freedom equally then you act which doesn’t

131
00:23:51,720 --> 00:24:04,580
bound you nor anybody else because it is knowledge,
it is discretion.

132
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:16,590
Age does not matter, what age you are. I’ve
seen some also very old people singing beautifully

133
00:24:16,590 --> 00:25:40,259
and enjoying Sahaja Yoga

134
00:25:40,259 --> 00:29:11,159
and make Me enjoy also. Life is for us to
enjoy, nothing else. But because we’re not

135
00:29:11,159 --> 00:31:55,980
free people, we cannot enjoy. There is no
bondage of

136
00:31:55,980 --> 00:34:47,849
any evil thought

137
00:34:47,849 --> 00:37:07,230
which keeps you down. It is so subtle but
penetrating into every that is gross, that

138
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:24,219
is Shri Krishna’s beautiful flute which
creates a picture of the nature. The description

139
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:32,089
, the whole thing becomes silent like a picture.

140
00:37:32,089 --> 00:38:08,859
So this evening we’ll have the puja, we’ll
have 
all the enjoyment of Shri Krishna’s blessings

141
00:38:08,859 --> 00:39:23,049
upon us. There’s no end to

142
00:39:23,049 --> 00:44:37,390
the stories of

143
00:44:37,390 --> 00:47:32,470
Shri Krishna, all full of mirth and play and
innocence that kills rakshashas, devils. So

144
00:47:32,470 --> 00:48:43,890
today I’ve talked to

145
00:48:43,890 --> 00:50:07,180
you

146
00:50:07,180 --> 00:55:29,359
about His childhood, and the puja I’ll tell
you about Gita.

147
00:55:29,359 --> 00:56:22,680
May God bless you.
