00:03.580 --> 00:30.310
Dedication through Meditation
Cowley Manor Seminar

00:30.310 --> 00:52.590
Cheltenham, England
31st July 1982

01:27.909 --> 01:29.315
Today, for the

01:29.340 --> 01:57.791
first time, I’m venturing to say something
which I should have said much earlier.

01:58.696 --> 02:15.477
As today I told you that it is necessary that
you have to recognise Me.

02:15.477 --> 02:20.887
And that recognition is fixed, that condition
is fixed.

02:20.887 --> 02:24.137
I cannot change it.

02:24.137 --> 02:42.307
As Christ has already said, that “Anything
against Me will be tolerated, will be forgiven,

02:42.307 --> 02:47.097
but anything against the Holy Ghost will not
be.’’

02:47.097 --> 02:51.347
It’s a very big warning ... very big warning.

02:51.347 --> 02:58.797
Perhaps people don’t realize what it means.

02:58.797 --> 03:05.337
Of course none of you are against Me, that
I know, and you don’t do anything against

03:05.337 --> 03:09.356
Me, that’s very true.

03:09.356 --> 03:21.087
After all, you are My children, I love you
very much and you love Me.

03:21.087 --> 03:29.067
That’s only the warning that Christ has
given you.

03:29.067 --> 03:43.557
But one must think why we are not progressing
so fast as we should have.

03:43.557 --> 03:54.026
When people are mesmerized, they fall completely
flat on the ground in front of their gurus,

03:54.026 --> 03:55.026
absolutely.

03:55.026 --> 04:03.487
They give up their money, they give up everything,
homes, houses, families, children, and just

04:03.487 --> 04:14.697
go flat - when they are mesmerized; without
asking any questions, without going into any

04:14.697 --> 04:23.486
detail, without trying to find out the life
of their guru.

04:23.486 --> 04:40.926
All such people also go very fast into darkness,
into greater darkness, and into complete destruction.

04:40.926 --> 04:48.287
But you are Sahaja Yogis and you have to construct
yourself.

04:48.287 --> 04:53.057
I didn’t want to shatter your egos before,
never to tell you in these words.

04:53.057 --> 05:00.727
Perhaps this is the first time I am saying
this to you, that you have to dedicate yourself

05:00.727 --> 05:06.696
completely to Me - not to Sahaja Yoga - but
to Me.

05:06.696 --> 05:11.256
Sahaja Yoga is just one of My aspects.

05:11.256 --> 05:17.437
Leaving everything, you have to dedicate.

05:17.437 --> 05:23.437
Complete dedication, otherwise you cannot
ascend any further.

05:23.437 --> 05:27.717
Without questioning, without arguing.

05:27.717 --> 05:35.187
Complete dedication is the only way you can
achieve it.

05:35.187 --> 05:38.326
People still get caught up, still get into
problems.

05:38.326 --> 05:40.807
What’s the reason?

05:40.807 --> 05:52.736
So many people ask Me that, “Once we have
got Realization, how is it Mother we go down?”

05:52.736 --> 05:59.967
The only reason is the dedication is not complete.

05:59.967 --> 06:06.926
Is complete reverence and complete dedication
has been not established.

06:06.926 --> 06:15.027
You still do not know that I am Divine, to
that extent as you should.

06:15.027 --> 06:17.557
I don’t say all of you.

06:17.557 --> 06:25.147
But still if you look into your heart and
look into your mind, you’ll find out that

06:25.147 --> 06:34.147
complete devotion that you had for say, Christ,
or for Krishna, or for any one of those who

06:34.147 --> 06:36.546
have been, is not there.

06:36.546 --> 06:42.926
Krishna said, Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam
sharanam vraja.

06:42.926 --> 06:48.516
“Forget all the religions of the world.”

06:48.516 --> 06:53.606
He didn’t mean the religions like Hindu,
Christian, Muslim, but He was meaning all

06:53.606 --> 06:54.736
the sustenances.

06:54.736 --> 07:02.796
“Forget all the sustenances, and completely
dedicate to Me.”

07:02.796 --> 07:04.816
That was six thousand years back.

07:04.816 --> 07:11.506
And there are many who would still say that
“we have completely dedicated ourselves

07:11.506 --> 07:13.886
to Shri Krishna.”

07:13.886 --> 07:17.627
Where is He now?

07:17.627 --> 07:23.057
Even those whom I have given Realization,
they say like this.

07:23.057 --> 07:28.796
Of course, there’s no difference between
Him and Me, but today I am the one, I am the

07:28.796 --> 07:36.046
one who has given you Realization.

07:36.046 --> 07:52.356
But our first consideration could be our jobs,
our own problems, our family problems, our

07:52.356 --> 08:02.546
financial problems, and dedication is the
last.

08:02.546 --> 08:07.596
I’m illusive, is true.

08:07.596 --> 08:08.596
My name is Mahamaya.

08:08.596 --> 08:11.837
I am illusive, no doubt.

08:11.837 --> 08:24.846
But I’m illusive just to judge you.

08:24.846 --> 08:33.246
Now the dedication is a very important part
of the ascent.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.537
Why?

08:36.537 --> 08:46.737
Because when you are precariously placed,
when there is immediate danger to your existence;

08:46.737 --> 08:58.677
at this time, when the whole world is standing
at a precarious position where it is going

08:58.677 --> 09:08.070
to be destroyed completely, it’s very important
that you cling on to thing that is going to

09:08.070 --> 09:17.567
save you with complete might and complete
faith.

09:17.567 --> 09:22.767
Like you are getting drenched in ordinary
water, doesn’t matter.

09:22.767 --> 09:29.407
But if you are sinking in the sea, and there’s
a question of this moment of existence and

09:29.407 --> 09:37.757
that moment of destruction - that time, if
a hand comes forward to fetch you out, there’s

09:37.757 --> 09:53.657
no time for you to think anymore but cling
on to it, with all your might, with all your

09:53.657 --> 09:55.747
faith.

09:55.747 --> 10:03.777
When we have badhas, when we are surrounded
by negativity, we get aware of it, and little

10:03.777 --> 10:06.427
bit we get confused.

10:06.427 --> 10:11.877
And that’s the time we want to cling on.

10:11.877 --> 10:16.817
But the badhas give you ideas which are detrimental.

10:16.817 --> 10:24.847
So big struggle is set in.

10:24.847 --> 10:33.697
At that time, what is the best way?

10:33.697 --> 10:38.747
Best way is to forget everything else.

10:38.747 --> 10:42.887
Forget that you are possessed, or there’s
badha or anything.

10:42.887 --> 10:54.687
With all your might, whatever is there, you
have to hold on to Me.

10:54.687 --> 11:06.797
But our style of dedication is very fashionable
and modern, in which Sahaja Yoga is by the

11:06.797 --> 11:09.317
way, and Mother is very much by the way.

11:09.317 --> 11:14.907
I’m sorry it’s not going to work out.

11:14.907 --> 11:22.027
I don’t have to tell this to Indians, because
if you read Devi Mahatmayam it’s sufficient.

11:22.027 --> 11:29.457
Even if you read Her thousand names, it’s
sufficient, that She can be only achieved

11:29.457 --> 11:30.457
through bhakti.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.717
She can only be achieved through dedication.

11:33.717 --> 11:37.897
She’s only fond of Her bhaktas, the devotees.

11:37.897 --> 11:44.527
It’s nowhere written that She is fond of
people who can talk better, who can argue

11:44.527 --> 11:51.917
better, who dress better, who live better,
who have better surroundings - but Her devotees.

11:51.917 --> 12:01.917
And this devotion and dedication should not
be a frenzy or anything, but should be sustained,

12:01.917 --> 12:06.257
continuous, ever-flowing, ever growing.

12:06.257 --> 12:14.567
That’s the only way, now, for further development.

12:14.567 --> 12:28.937
For us, so many small problems are important.

12:28.937 --> 12:34.757
Somebody has a house, somebody has a admission
in the college, somebody has some job to be

12:34.757 --> 12:42.277
done.

12:42.277 --> 12:50.907
All these considerations are the dharmas which
Shri Krishna has described as "Sarva dharmanam

12:50.907 --> 12:53.147
parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja."

12:53.147 --> 12:57.817
Give up all the dharmas - all these so called
dharmas.

12:57.817 --> 13:04.957
Like a patni dharma is the duty of a wife,
then the pati dharma is duty of a husband,

13:04.957 --> 13:11.667
then the putra dharma is the duty of a son,
the pita dharma duty of a father, and duty

13:11.667 --> 13:17.507
of a citizen, and a duty of a world-citizen.

13:17.507 --> 13:33.657
All these dharmas are to be given up, entirely,
and you have to surrender fully from your

13:33.657 --> 13:36.287
heart.

13:36.287 --> 13:42.377
I am what I am, I’ve been that, I’ll be
that.

13:42.377 --> 13:48.147
I’m not going to grow any more, or less.

13:48.147 --> 13:50.747
This is an eternal Personality.

13:50.747 --> 14:02.417
It is now for you to get out of Me whatever
is possible, to make the best use of your

14:02.417 --> 14:26.377
birth in these modern times, to grow to your
full maturity, to be able to work out the

14:26.377 --> 14:38.537
complete design that Divine wants to do through
you.

14:38.537 --> 14:50.507
As soon as the dedication starts, you become
dynamic.

14:50.507 --> 14:53.837
Clinging on to that.

14:53.837 --> 15:04.027
For this, meditation is the only way, I should
say.

15:04.027 --> 15:08.337
Of course, rationally you can do many things.

15:08.337 --> 15:13.977
You can rationally accept Me.

15:13.977 --> 15:21.777
Emotionally you may feel closer to Me in your
heart.

15:21.777 --> 15:28.997
But through meditation, surrender.

15:28.997 --> 15:39.587
Meditation is nothing but surrendering, is
complete surrendering - which is a difficult

15:39.587 --> 15:43.577
task for a modern man in the Western countries.

15:43.577 --> 15:51.017
He only surrenders to people who mesmerize,
who fully mesmerize them.

15:51.017 --> 15:55.717
They become slaves of people who mesmerize.

15:55.717 --> 16:05.397
But in their own freedom, their ego is more
powerful than their Spirit - in their own

16:05.397 --> 16:06.397
freedom.

16:06.397 --> 16:10.787
That’s why all the free countries have gone
to dogs.

16:10.787 --> 16:17.087
Because ego plays part, not the Spirit.

16:17.087 --> 16:26.647
They cannot master their ego when they are
free.

16:26.647 --> 16:33.347
Only if somebody can just entangle their ego
and mesmerize them, then they are alright

16:33.347 --> 16:36.577
- they are shut, completely they surrender.

16:36.577 --> 16:44.757
And it’s so obvious from the way these false
people have mastered their art of making slaves

16:44.757 --> 16:48.087
out of you.

16:48.087 --> 17:08.466
In your full freedom, complete freedom, you
have to surrender.

17:08.466 --> 17:14.346
Freedom does not mean ego, one should understand.

17:14.346 --> 17:20.706
Freedom is killed by ego.

17:20.706 --> 17:28.586
Not only killed but is disfigured and disgraced,
is made ugly.

17:28.586 --> 17:47.956
Freedom, in its subtlest form, means complete
egolessness, no angularities, complete hollowness,

17:47.956 --> 17:54.086
just like the flute, so that the melody of
God could be played well.

17:54.086 --> 18:03.086
That’s complete freedom - no “hangs-up”.

18:03.086 --> 18:21.767
We have to realize that we are in the mire:
mire of ignorance, mire of sin.

18:21.767 --> 18:26.417
Ignorance brings sin.

18:26.417 --> 18:36.127
How are we to get out of the mire?

18:36.127 --> 18:40.627
Anybody who tries to pull us out will also
go in the mire.

18:40.627 --> 18:50.127
Anybody who wants to come even near the mire,
gets into the mire.

18:50.127 --> 18:56.436
He becomes part and parcel of the mire.

18:56.436 --> 19:03.247
The more we try to take help from others,
we pull him more in the mire and we go more

19:03.247 --> 19:09.956
down, deep down, into it.

19:09.956 --> 19:26.406
So the tree of Kundalini has to grow, and
from that tree, Paramatma Himself, the Parabrahma

19:26.406 --> 19:34.297
itself has to pull you out.

19:34.297 --> 19:47.037
It grows out of the mire, and the Parabrahma
has to pull you out, one by one, take you

19:47.037 --> 19:55.456
in the hand and swing you outward.

19:55.456 --> 20:10.036
But still when you are pulled out, your catch
is not sufficient, you slip down again.

20:10.036 --> 20:20.367
You come up partly, again you go down.

20:20.367 --> 20:27.757
It’s very enjoyable to be out of it, but
still the feet have not come out fully.

20:27.757 --> 20:32.166
Still you are not completely cleansed.

20:32.166 --> 20:39.977
Unless and until you are cleansed how can
you be completely blessed?

20:39.977 --> 20:51.117
You have to be fully blessed by the Divine,
clothed by the love of God.

20:51.117 --> 20:59.887
It is surprising to see how the people who
go to these false gurus stick on to him, or

20:59.887 --> 21:09.287
stick on to her, in such tremendous dedication,
that you are amazed - they become just like

21:09.287 --> 21:10.287
cabbages.

21:10.287 --> 21:23.546
Till they are completely ruined they just
go on surrendering everything that they have.

21:23.546 --> 21:36.377
But in Sahaja Yoga, when people come, they
do not surrender, but they are nourished,

21:36.377 --> 21:39.037
they are looked after.

21:39.037 --> 21:47.017
Their health improves, their wealth improves,
their mind improves, their relations improve,

21:47.017 --> 21:51.096
every way they feel better, their conditions
improve.

21:51.096 --> 21:56.867
They are all the time getting the benefit.

21:56.867 --> 22:11.647
We have ashrams which are beautiful, which
are the cheapest, and the food, every advantage

22:11.647 --> 22:19.336
that is available -best possible.

22:19.336 --> 22:37.076
Everything is there.

22:37.076 --> 22:49.017
But we don’t realize that all this nourishment
is for what?

22:49.017 --> 22:52.227
All these blessings are for what?

22:52.227 --> 22:54.536
For your higher ascent.

22:54.536 --> 23:00.216
For getting out of the mire completely.

23:00.216 --> 23:11.286
Now, you have to adhere, you have to be dedicated,
you have to be devoted.

23:11.286 --> 23:25.196
We have reservations, we hide things.

23:25.196 --> 23:38.176
We try to be smart.

23:38.176 --> 23:51.146
That’s a dangerous situation.

23:51.146 --> 24:13.166
You all should, within yourself, try to see
what part is so sneaky.

24:13.166 --> 24:21.107
What conditioning is keeping you out of dedication?

24:21.107 --> 24:27.127
What is making you have reservations?

24:27.127 --> 24:40.607
What fright, which ego, what angle still sticking
out into the mire?

24:40.607 --> 24:51.196
What attachments, what relationships?

24:51.196 --> 25:00.507
You have to get out of it.

25:00.507 --> 25:08.387
Unless and until you fully get out of it,
it’s not going to work out.

25:08.387 --> 25:17.326
There’s no place for half-way things.

25:17.326 --> 25:22.477
It’s question of now or never.

25:22.477 --> 25:24.517
Christ has said it.

25:24.517 --> 25:41.066
He has said it, “You give your devotion
and dedication and leave the rest to Me.’’

25:41.066 --> 25:50.796
I know who are progressing in dedication and
devotion.

25:50.796 --> 25:55.806
I have seen people improving so much.

25:55.806 --> 26:01.526
You need not face Me, you need not see Me.

26:01.526 --> 26:04.057
In person I need not be there.

26:04.057 --> 26:08.456
It’s all in the all-pervading Power.

26:08.456 --> 26:20.657
That’s all My light, which knows each and
everything about you.

26:20.657 --> 26:28.806
And only through your bhakti, through your
devotion and dedication, you can achieve Me.

26:28.806 --> 26:38.507
My achievement is the complete manifestation
of your Divine power.

26:38.507 --> 26:47.807
It’s very simple, made so simple.

26:47.807 --> 27:01.826
I’m only pleased by people who are simple,
innocent, who are not tricky, who are loving,

27:01.826 --> 27:05.617
affectionate to each other.

27:05.617 --> 27:12.916
It’s very easy to please Me.

27:12.916 --> 27:20.557
When I see you loving each other, talking
good of each other, helping each other, respecting

27:20.557 --> 27:30.646
each other, laughing aloud together, enjoying
together each other’s company, I get My

27:30.646 --> 27:42.576
first blessing, first joy.

27:42.576 --> 27:52.187
Try to love each other, in dedication to Me,
because you are all My children, created out

27:52.187 --> 27:57.706
of My love.

27:57.706 --> 28:03.727
In the womb of My love you all have resided.

28:03.727 --> 28:12.387
From My heart I have given you these blessings.

28:12.387 --> 28:22.117
I get disturbed, My hands shake and you fall
back into the mire again, when I see you quarrelling

28:22.117 --> 28:23.276
among yourselves.

28:23.276 --> 28:32.257
Jealousies and petty things which belong to
your past life.

28:32.257 --> 28:57.146
The help is not so much gross that is felt,
but is a very deeper sense of security, that

28:57.146 --> 29:04.776
is given to your brothers and sisters.

29:04.776 --> 29:10.107
A deep love should exist.

29:10.107 --> 29:20.667
Selfishness has no place in Sahaja Yoga.

29:20.667 --> 29:27.507
Miserliness has no place - has no place.

29:27.507 --> 29:30.747
Miserliness is a sign of a very small mind.

29:30.747 --> 29:34.056
I’m not saying you give Me money, of course.

29:34.056 --> 29:41.877
But the way we look at money, the way we cling
on to it, the material things, the material

29:41.877 --> 29:46.666
wealth, the material objects, the possessions
you see.

29:46.666 --> 29:49.426
The greatest possession you have is your Mother.

29:49.426 --> 30:01.237
Through Her you have your brothers and sisters.

30:01.237 --> 30:03.196
Get out of that past life.

30:03.196 --> 30:09.326
That past is the mire.

30:09.326 --> 30:19.617
That should be over now.

30:19.617 --> 30:27.997
You are quite aware how, with My power of
Love, I have protected you all.

30:27.997 --> 30:35.086
You know how, at every moment, I’ve helped
you.

30:35.086 --> 30:41.656
At every point of your desire, I have come
forward to fulfill it.

30:41.656 --> 30:53.946
That’s one side, as I said, the nourishment.

30:53.946 --> 30:57.887
But now your ascent has to come from you.

30:57.887 --> 31:09.706
Your rising has to come from you.

31:09.706 --> 31:15.377
That has to be worked out by you and you alone.

31:15.377 --> 31:22.286
Not by any other Sahaja Yogi or by Me.

31:22.286 --> 31:27.336
I can only give you suggestions.

31:27.336 --> 31:31.877
Not only the suggestion, but the warnings.

31:31.877 --> 31:34.076
And everything is at hand.

31:34.076 --> 31:35.076
It’s all worked out so well.

31:35.076 --> 31:37.426
I’m in Form.

31:37.426 --> 31:41.117
I’m in Form before you.

31:41.117 --> 31:45.336
You don’t have to go anywhere.

31:45.336 --> 31:50.196
The whole thing is within yourself.

31:50.196 --> 31:55.997
You don’t have to give money, you don’t
have to give anything.

31:55.997 --> 32:02.037
But develop that dedication within yourself.

32:02.037 --> 32:18.607
You see, this man who interviewed Me said
that the unemployed are maneuvered by the

32:18.607 --> 32:20.586
politicians.

32:20.586 --> 32:28.546
Let God maneuver you.

32:28.546 --> 32:32.387
But how?

32:32.387 --> 32:38.566
Supposing I have a brush in My hand, I want
to paint something, and the brush I cannot

32:38.566 --> 32:41.286
maneuver.

32:41.286 --> 32:51.826
The brush is angular, it’s troublesome,
it’s inconvenient to use that, or, you can

32:51.826 --> 32:58.007
say it’s uncomfortable, it’s awkward,
it’s clumsy.

32:58.007 --> 33:05.586
How can you use it?

33:05.586 --> 33:12.146
Dedication is the easiest way to get rid of
all your angularities, all your problems,

33:12.146 --> 33:19.086
all your baddhas.

33:19.086 --> 33:28.977
Now watch and see within yourself: are you
dedicated?

33:28.977 --> 33:37.156
Those who are fanatically adhering to Me are
also not correct.

33:37.156 --> 33:41.536
There should be no fanaticism about it.

33:41.536 --> 33:48.216
The whole thing becomes a complete logical
thing.

33:48.216 --> 34:02.617
There is no fanaticism about it.

34:02.617 --> 34:19.737
Like, somebody
has to go to a doctor, to see a doctor, then

34:19.737 --> 34:26.867
fanatic person might say, “Oh, I’m not
going to see the doctor.

34:26.867 --> 34:34.456
I’m not going, because Mother has told me
that She’s going to look after me.”

34:34.456 --> 34:41.297
And when she gets sick, she’ll come to Mother
and fight, “Mother You had told me that

34:41.297 --> 34:45.946
You’ll look after me, and how is it I’ve
got sick?”

34:45.946 --> 34:47.937
This is fanaticism.

34:47.937 --> 34:50.477
What is surrendering?

34:50.477 --> 35:01.607
Deep down you should say, “It’s the Mother,
She’s there, She’s my doctor.

35:01.607 --> 35:08.967
Whether She treats me or not, whether She
cures me or not I’ve nothing to say.

35:08.967 --> 35:09.967
I only know Her.

35:09.967 --> 35:17.947
I don’t know anyone else.”

35:17.947 --> 35:21.887
Is very logical.

35:21.887 --> 35:27.937
The logic is, that Mother is the most powerful
thing that you know - logically it’s true.

35:27.937 --> 35:33.607
“And if She is so, She’ll cure me.

35:33.607 --> 35:36.667
But if She does not cure me, it’s Her Power,
it’s Her whim.

35:36.667 --> 35:38.907
If She wants to cure me, She’ll cure me.

35:38.907 --> 35:43.717
If She does not want to cure me, how can I
put my will upon Her?”

35:43.717 --> 35:48.557
Like the dedication of Shri Ganesha.

35:48.557 --> 35:54.527
That when his Mother said, “All right, between
the two brothers, Kartikeya and Him, the one

35:54.527 --> 36:04.557
who will go round the Mother Earth first will
get the first prize.’’

36:04.557 --> 36:13.887
Now poor Ganesha had a little rat on which
to move, but wisdom He had.

36:13.887 --> 36:21.417
And Kartikeya had a very quick-moving peacock
which used to fly.

36:21.417 --> 36:31.037
He looked at the peacock and He said, “Who
is greater than My Mother?

36:31.037 --> 36:32.037
She’s Adi Shakti.

36:32.037 --> 36:33.297
What is this earth?

36:33.297 --> 36:35.047
Who has created this earth?

36:35.047 --> 36:36.697
Is My Mother has created her.

36:36.697 --> 36:38.547
Who has created this sun?

36:38.547 --> 36:39.907
The Mother has created it.

36:39.907 --> 36:41.557
Who is greater than My Mother?

36:41.557 --> 36:43.057
No one else.

36:43.057 --> 36:46.097
Why not go round My Mother only?

36:46.097 --> 36:51.667
What’s the need to go all round the whole
earth?”

36:51.667 --> 37:00.917
And much before Kartikeya arrived He was sitting
with His present in His hand.

37:00.917 --> 37:07.597
His innocence gave Him this wisdom to understand
– that’s what logical is.

37:07.597 --> 37:11.126
It’s very logical.

37:11.126 --> 37:16.597
And also logical it is that “Mother feels
my pain more than I feel.”

37:16.597 --> 37:24.047
What will you say when Christ was crucified
for his Mother?

37:24.047 --> 37:30.517
She was Mahalakshmi Herself, so powerful.

37:30.517 --> 37:38.617
She made Her Son sacrifice His life, suffer
like a human being.

37:38.617 --> 37:48.897
It was too much, to make Your Son sacrifice,
when You have all the powers in Your hand

37:48.897 --> 37:50.217
to finish everyone there.

37:50.217 --> 38:02.337
But was a very delicate job to create this
Agnya Chakra.

38:02.337 --> 38:06.307
What does that mean?

38:06.307 --> 38:17.547
Does that mean that He lacked something in
His devotion?

38:17.547 --> 38:29.887
On the contrary, She was so sure of Him, of
His devotion, that She could ask Him to do

38:29.887 --> 38:32.037
that.

38:32.037 --> 38:36.517
So when we expect Mother to do something for
you, there are people who say, “All right,

38:36.517 --> 38:38.107
Mother I’m giving this thesis.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.417
I must get through.”

38:39.417 --> 38:42.277
All right, give a bandhan, you get a thesis.

38:42.277 --> 38:43.937
“Mother, I’m trying to discover this.’’

38:43.937 --> 38:45.307
All right, you have it.

38:45.307 --> 38:47.587
“Mother I’m trying to get this job.’’

38:47.587 --> 38:50.347
You have it.

38:50.347 --> 38:58.707
Now, is the other way round.

38:58.707 --> 39:01.427
How many have dedication that of Christ?

39:01.427 --> 39:02.447
None.

39:02.447 --> 39:05.487
It’s a fact.

39:05.487 --> 39:10.137
Why is He the eldest brother?

39:10.137 --> 39:12.367
Because no-one like Him.

39:12.367 --> 39:25.077
He went through all those horrible sufferings,
because He was part and parcel of His Mother.

39:25.077 --> 39:29.137
She suffered much more than Him.

39:29.137 --> 39:34.967
He also went through that suffering for a
greater goal, for a greater happiness, for

39:34.967 --> 39:36.987
a greater life, for a wholesome life.

39:36.987 --> 39:44.977
That is real dedication.

39:44.977 --> 39:52.177
But the false people can take advantage of
this.

39:52.177 --> 39:56.837
When they make the people suffer, they say,
“after all, you have to suffer.”

39:56.837 --> 40:01.567
See how they make it up.

40:01.567 --> 40:08.307
“You must suffer because after all you must
suffer, otherwise you cannot rise.”

40:08.307 --> 40:18.267
It’s a very subtle understanding, very subtle
it is.

40:18.267 --> 40:24.787
That will make it clear to you that in Sahaja
Yoga first you are nourished, you are brought

40:24.787 --> 40:30.117
up, you are trained, you are made all right.

40:30.117 --> 40:36.367
And all the things after that, the sufferings,
are no more sufferings to you because you

40:36.367 --> 40:37.987
have become the Spirit.

40:37.987 --> 40:44.997
“Nainam chhidanti shashtrani, nainam dahti
pavkah, nainam kledanti aapoh, nainam shoshati

40:44.997 --> 40:55.577
marutah”: “It cannot be killed by any
instrument, it cannot be thrown away or blown

40:55.577 --> 41:01.467
away by any wind, it cannot be burnt by any
fire.”

41:01.467 --> 41:08.527
There’s no way you can destroy this.

41:08.527 --> 41:14.957
That is the Spirit that you are.

41:14.957 --> 41:18.067
So the nourishment has been given now.

41:18.067 --> 41:19.937
You have grown up.

41:19.937 --> 41:22.367
You are nourished.

41:22.367 --> 41:26.777
People when they see Sahaja Yogis, say, “Oh,
they are like flowers.

41:26.777 --> 41:29.117
See their faces, they glow.

41:29.117 --> 41:31.927
How confident, how dignified, how beautiful.”

41:31.927 --> 41:38.457
But for what?

41:38.457 --> 41:44.927
To be the wheels of the chariot of God.

41:44.927 --> 41:57.267
You have to bear the brunt, and the sacrifices,
which are no more sacrifices to you because

41:57.267 --> 42:01.197
Spirit gives, it never sacrifices.

42:01.197 --> 42:05.787
Its quality is to give.

42:05.787 --> 42:07.677
So you don’t sacrifice, you just give.

42:07.677 --> 42:19.217
First the mother has the labor pains, all
right, she has all the problems, all right.

42:19.217 --> 42:31.097
When the child is grown then he stands by
the mother.

42:31.097 --> 42:36.897
He is the proud son.

42:36.897 --> 42:40.467
She is proud of him and he is proud of her.

42:40.467 --> 42:46.337
They stand together, they fight the battle
together.

42:46.337 --> 42:58.187
That’s only possible if complete dedication
and preparation for the future life of a Sahaja

42:58.187 --> 43:01.017
Yogi, you accept.

43:01.017 --> 43:13.677
A life which outwardly looks to be a struggle,
a problem, but inwardly is most fulfilling.

43:13.677 --> 43:23.747
Once upon a time, when Sahaja Yogis come to
Me, to them even to sit on the ground is too

43:23.747 --> 43:29.707
much of a sacrifice; even to take out shoes
is a big sacrifice.

43:29.707 --> 43:34.787
Yesterday, in a program, three people walked
off because they were asked to take out shoes,

43:34.787 --> 43:38.697
as if somebody was making them bald-headed.

43:38.697 --> 43:47.867
They just walked off.

43:47.867 --> 43:53.147
But why to grow in Sahaja Yoga?

43:53.147 --> 44:00.837
To grow, to stand up like great children of
a great Mother.

44:00.837 --> 44:02.687
The work is tremendous.

44:02.687 --> 44:18.227
It’s not for medium, mediocre people to
do this job, frightened, fearful, arrogant,

44:18.227 --> 44:34.057
cheeky - they cannot, they have no mettle.

44:34.057 --> 44:49.307
So, the dedication in meditation, complete
dedication in meditation must be practiced.

44:49.307 --> 44:56.217
It’s not for your good now you are doing,
so-called “your”.

44:56.217 --> 45:01.897
First you were a little baby, a small thing;
now you are that collective being, so you

45:01.897 --> 45:06.237
are not doing anything for yourself, but for
that collective being.

45:06.237 --> 45:22.897
You are growing to be aware of that whole
which you are going to become.

45:22.897 --> 45:35.667
Your jobs, your money, your wives, your husbands,
your children, your father, mother, relations,

45:35.667 --> 45:42.497
these considerations are over now.

45:42.497 --> 45:48.437
You all have to take up the responsibility
of Sahaja Yoga.

45:48.437 --> 45:55.327
Every one of you is quite capable.

45:55.327 --> 46:03.037
You are brought up for that.

46:03.037 --> 46:12.697
Do whichever way you like, whatever are your
capacities.

46:12.697 --> 46:20.797
With full dedication you’ll get it.

46:20.797 --> 46:30.367
Dedication is the thing.

46:30.367 --> 46:37.497
Complete dedication is the only way you can
go further.

46:37.497 --> 46:42.687
There are some Sahaja Yogis, who are half-baked,
we have to drop them.

46:42.687 --> 46:45.037
We can’t help it.

46:45.037 --> 46:47.427
You don’t have sympathies with them.

46:47.427 --> 46:48.427
No good.

46:48.427 --> 46:52.927
If they prove all right we’ll bring them
back again, but you leave that to Me.

46:52.927 --> 46:57.197
You don’t put your effort or put your attention
to them.

46:57.197 --> 47:01.177
You have to come up.

47:01.177 --> 47:11.717
You were seekers, then you have found it,
now you have thrived over it, now you are

47:11.717 --> 47:13.257
grown up.

47:13.257 --> 47:14.797
For what?

47:14.797 --> 47:17.657
Is to stand up.

47:17.657 --> 47:26.147
As I am facing you today, you have to face
the others, you have to face the people.

47:26.147 --> 47:29.767
Dedication doesn’t mean that you don’t
talk of Sahaja Yoga.

47:29.767 --> 47:34.697
Many people think that keeping silent is the
way you are dedicated.

47:34.697 --> 47:39.207
Only in meditation you should be.

47:39.207 --> 47:44.177
But you have to get out of that shell.

47:44.177 --> 47:53.767
Tell all the nations and tell all the people,
all over, the great message that the time

47:53.767 --> 48:03.207
of Resurrection is here, now, at this time,
and that you all are capable of doing it.

48:03.207 --> 48:16.807
If somebody tries to sneer at you for that,
with understanding, wisdom, try to say things.

48:16.807 --> 48:24.217
Individual likes and dislikes must be sacrificed.

48:24.217 --> 48:30.867
“I like this” and “I like that” must
be given up.

48:30.867 --> 48:35.517
It doesn’t mean that you all become like
machines.

48:35.517 --> 48:36.887
No.

48:36.887 --> 48:42.567
But the enslavement to this “I” must be
given up.

48:42.567 --> 48:46.037
Enslavery to habits must be given up.

48:46.037 --> 48:51.317
You’ll be amazed.

48:51.317 --> 48:54.607
Once you are dedicated, you’ll not eat much.

48:54.607 --> 48:58.067
You may not eat at all sometimes.

48:58.067 --> 49:01.197
You wouldn’t even remember a food.

49:01.197 --> 49:03.827
You wouldn’t even remember what you have
eaten.

49:03.827 --> 49:13.007
You wouldn’t even remember where you slept,
how you slept.

49:13.007 --> 49:25.147
Is a life that will be like a telescope - expanding.

49:25.147 --> 49:33.657
You will create your own visions and complete
them, fulfill them.

49:33.657 --> 49:43.177
You look so simple, ordinary people, but you
are not.

49:43.177 --> 49:58.247
In dedication, in complete devotion, you have
to do it, now, not for your own gain, for

49:58.247 --> 50:02.687
your own achievement, that’s over now.

50:02.687 --> 50:14.247
Is for completely getting out of the mire
and standing on the land, singing aloud the

50:14.247 --> 50:19.447
praise of your Father.

50:19.447 --> 50:23.007
Those who are in the mire, what music can
they give?

50:23.007 --> 50:25.267
What songs they can sing?

50:25.267 --> 50:30.307
What security can they give?

50:30.307 --> 50:34.437
What help they can render to others?

50:34.437 --> 50:38.417
You have to be out of it, completely.

50:38.417 --> 50:46.847
Steadfast wisdom is needed for that, steadfast.

50:46.847 --> 50:52.637
Every moment.

50:52.637 --> 51:05.237
You need not blame your left side and right
side for that, nothing, you just get out of

51:05.237 --> 51:06.237
it.

51:06.237 --> 51:07.237
Cling on to it.

51:07.237 --> 51:10.967
The Parabrahma has come to look after you.

51:10.967 --> 51:13.247
Cling on to it.

51:13.247 --> 51:16.407
Even the death has to go back.

51:16.407 --> 51:21.307
Then what about these minor things?

51:21.307 --> 51:39.717
Now the name of your Mother is very powerful.

51:39.717 --> 51:52.877
You know that is the most powerful Name than
all other names, the most powerful mantra.

51:52.877 --> 51:56.507
But you must know how to take it.

51:56.507 --> 52:02.907
With that complete dedication you have to
take that Name.

52:02.907 --> 52:06.237
Not like any other name.

52:06.237 --> 52:12.497
You know that in India when take the name
of Guru, they pull their ears for taking the

52:12.497 --> 52:13.837
name of the Guru.

52:13.837 --> 52:21.197
Means, “While taking the Name if I am making
any mistakes, please forgive me” - means

52:21.197 --> 52:23.017
that.

52:23.017 --> 52:29.077
This mantra is a very powerful mantra.

52:29.077 --> 52:42.137
Only what you need is the dedication, the
dynamite of dedication.

52:42.137 --> 52:53.267
Today I told Rita that all the daisies in
England have fragrance now.

52:53.267 --> 52:54.307
She couldn’t believe it.

52:54.307 --> 52:56.807
She said, “I have never known that.

52:56.807 --> 53:03.497
On the contrary I always felt that daisies
had no fragrance and they were very funnily-smelling

53:03.497 --> 53:04.547
flowers.’’

53:04.547 --> 53:11.197
I said, “All right, these daisies you have,
just go and smell them.’’

53:11.197 --> 53:16.347
When she smelt it, she was surprised.

53:16.347 --> 53:20.807
The Name, how subtle it is.

53:20.807 --> 53:25.527
They are the most fragrant flowers of England
today.

53:25.527 --> 53:44.617
Just the Name; which means Nishkalanka, which
means Nirmala, which means completely without

53:44.617 --> 53:45.617
any mala.

53:45.617 --> 53:46.747
What is this, mala?

53:46.747 --> 53:49.907
Is this mire.

53:49.907 --> 53:54.377
Without any mire.

53:54.377 --> 53:55.867
Nil.

53:55.867 --> 53:57.367
Absolutely.

53:57.367 --> 54:02.557
The joy at the Sahasrara is called as Nirananda,
since long.

54:02.557 --> 54:07.517
Since ancient times called Nirananda or Nirmalananda.

54:07.517 --> 54:14.437
So many call it as Nirmalananda or Nirananda.

54:14.437 --> 54:21.737
That joy is the joy that you enjoy even when
you get crucified.

54:21.737 --> 54:26.687
That joy, you enjoy even when you are poisoned.

54:26.687 --> 54:31.487
Even on your deathbed, you enjoy that joy.

54:31.487 --> 54:34.867
That joy is Nirananda.

54:34.867 --> 54:42.577
So be prepared for the second phase.

54:42.577 --> 54:46.257
You are in the front.

54:46.257 --> 54:53.067
It’s very little time I need.

54:53.067 --> 55:01.107
But I need really people with steadfast wisdom
and dedication; steadfast.

55:01.107 --> 55:12.817
Even for a second it should not go this side
or that side.

55:12.817 --> 55:22.497
Then, we can progress faster, we can go ahead
to fight the battle.

55:22.497 --> 55:31.467
Perhaps now you are aware of the subtleties
of the negativities, how they work, how they

55:31.467 --> 55:41.387
use their power - of course which is limited
- to destroy God’s work, and how you have

55:41.387 --> 55:46.107
to be alert, equipped, and dedicated.

55:46.107 --> 56:02.647
This I can only talk to you, I cannot say
to the people who come to Caxton Hall.

56:02.647 --> 56:13.527
Some of them are half-baked, some of them
are absolutely new, naive, and some of them

56:13.527 --> 56:15.237
are absolutely third-raters.

56:15.237 --> 56:30.547
But here, as you are before Me today, I want
to tell you very frankly, as Krishna had told

56:30.547 --> 56:39.307
only Arjuna, “sarva dharmanam parityajya,
mamekam sharanam vraja”.

56:39.307 --> 56:44.787
There’s no other way out.

56:44.787 --> 56:57.157
Vraja means the one who is twice-born, like
a solid, solid personality.

56:57.157 --> 57:01.877
When you are solid then you must dedicate.

57:01.877 --> 57:06.767
When you are perfected then you must dedicate.

57:06.767 --> 57:20.187
It will help you to get out of the mire, and
then it will help the great cause.

57:20.187 --> 57:27.147
No one understands that why Mother is trying
to help us?

57:27.147 --> 57:31.067
Oh they think She’s too generous.

57:31.067 --> 57:32.147
I’m not.

57:32.147 --> 57:39.187
I’ve lot of common sense.

57:39.187 --> 57:54.367
Because you are the ones who are capable of
manifesting God’s joy on this earth.

57:54.367 --> 57:58.267
You are the flutes which are going to play
the melody of God.

57:58.267 --> 58:08.597
You are going to be used and maneuvered by
God.

58:08.597 --> 58:17.307
I am doing all this to perfect you, to be
the most beautiful instrument of God.

58:17.307 --> 58:20.917
To be the right instrument of God.

58:20.917 --> 58:36.667
I don’t know if you understand how sweet,
beautiful life it would be.

58:36.667 --> 58:51.147
The life of dedication, with understanding,
logical, completely dedicated, extracting

58:51.147 --> 59:02.397
all the nourishment, and dedicating it for
a higher purpose.

59:02.397 --> 59:19.387
Something like the leaves extract the sun’s
rays, and give color, achieve color for themselves,

59:19.387 --> 59:30.477
for a higher purpose, that they can be used
by human beings later on.

59:30.477 --> 59:36.457
Nothing on this earth works out the other
way round.

59:36.457 --> 59:55.777
Everything works out for a purpose; but such
an unselfish, such a wide, such a great, dynamic

59:55.777 --> 59:59.467
purpose.

59:59.467 --> 01:00:12.877
You become the ocean, you become the moon,
you become the sun, you become the earth,

01:00:12.877 --> 01:00:20.107
you become the ether, the firmament, and you
become the Spirit.

01:00:20.107 --> 01:00:25.567
You work for all of them.

01:00:25.567 --> 01:00:34.187
All the stars and universes you become, and
take up their work.

01:00:34.187 --> 01:00:41.747
That’s what it is.

01:00:41.747 --> 01:00:46.457
Because you have jumped onto your principle,
onto your tattwa.

01:00:46.457 --> 01:00:51.427
That’s how you jump onto everybody’s tattwa.

01:00:51.427 --> 01:01:01.447
But be dedicated on that tattwa, because I
am the Principle of all these things.

01:01:01.447 --> 01:01:08.177
I am the tattwa - Tattvamasi, I am the Principle.

01:01:08.177 --> 01:01:16.617
Keep to your principle.

01:01:16.617 --> 01:01:20.827
I am the Kundalini.

01:01:20.827 --> 01:01:26.497
I am the Essence.

01:01:26.497 --> 01:01:34.117
We can only understand dedication of something
which looks bigger in gross ways, which appears

01:01:34.117 --> 01:01:37.457
bigger in a gross way.

01:01:37.457 --> 01:01:44.247
But we cannot dedicate ourselves to something
that is so much subtler, which is so much

01:01:44.247 --> 01:01:56.947
minuter, which is so much deeper, which is
so much effective, which is so much dynamic,

01:01:56.947 --> 01:02:00.037
so universal and so eternal.

01:02:00.037 --> 01:02:09.797
We cannot think of dedicating ourselves to
that.

01:02:09.797 --> 01:02:13.737
We can surrender ourselves to somebody who
looks like a mountain, who comes to oppress

01:02:13.737 --> 01:02:21.017
us just like a mountain, who is like Hitler,
who is like a false guru.

01:02:21.017 --> 01:02:38.827
But to surrender to your subtler being, which
you cannot see with your eyes, which is not

01:02:38.827 --> 01:02:49.767
audible, but, in effect, is so powerful.

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:54.127
Like the atomic bomb, when the atom is split.

01:02:54.127 --> 01:03:01.737
When it is not split, it’s everywhere.

01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:14.177
But at the subtlest point it’s so dynamic
that, when you separate it, it becomes such

01:03:14.177 --> 01:03:17.277
a dynamic force of destruction.

01:03:17.277 --> 01:03:33.447
As your attention has now penetrated into
the subtler side of this universe, you get

01:03:33.447 --> 01:03:39.406
deeper and deeper into.

01:03:39.406 --> 01:03:56.347
The urge that takes the end of the root to
the source of water, is the same as the source.

01:03:56.347 --> 01:04:08.637
Your Kundalini is the same as the Adi Kundalini
and its Power, the Parabrahma.

01:04:08.637 --> 01:04:22.277
All these things are to be understood after
Realization and after maturity.

01:04:22.277 --> 01:04:24.227
Before that it’s not possible.

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:29.807
That’s why for last eight years, I didn’t
say these things to you.

01:04:29.807 --> 01:04:40.727
I was always on a very patronizing and a sweet
terms with you.

01:04:40.727 --> 01:04:46.847
And always, I made you feel that you are obliging
Me.

01:04:46.847 --> 01:04:55.957
There’s no obligation.

01:04:55.957 --> 01:05:04.827
But beyond all these conceptions, you have
become your Self.

01:05:04.827 --> 01:05:11.287
Now ready to be responsible, to be what you
are made for.

01:05:11.287 --> 01:05:24.067
Like the ship is built, is brought to the
sea, tried, and found out to be sea-worthy,

01:05:24.067 --> 01:05:32.677
to sail out now, into the sea.

01:05:32.677 --> 01:05:41.277
So this is the second phase, where you have
to sail out, when you know everything about

01:05:41.277 --> 01:05:46.487
the ship, everything about the sea.

01:05:46.487 --> 01:05:57.007
With complete freedom and wisdom, you have
to sail now, not afraid of any storms, or

01:05:57.007 --> 01:06:06.217
any hails, or any typhoons, because now on
you know, your job is to cross through.

01:06:06.217 --> 01:06:07.947
May God bless you!

01:06:07.947 --> 01:06:09.677
May God bless you!

01:06:09.677 --> 01:06:12.277
Should we meditate for a while?

01:06:12.277 --> 01:06:29.847
Can you put off the lights?

01:06:29.847 --> 01:06:51.277
Such vibrations, I tell you.

01:06:51.277 --> 01:07:15.267
If you can form a chain, would be a good idea...

01:07:15.267 --> 01:07:19.147
[SOUNDS OF YOGIS SHIFTING]

01:07:19.147 --> 01:07:23.467
Just see where is Aradhana and Anupama and
also, who's there, Bhavila just look after

01:07:23.467 --> 01:07:24.467
them.

01:07:24.467 --> 01:07:25.467
And where is that.

01:07:25.467 --> 01:07:28.207
Kay, can you go down and also see where is
that lady?

01:07:28.207 --> 01:07:31.077
This is a big house and they should not be
lost."
