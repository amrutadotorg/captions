04:38:48.357 --> 04:38:56.351
It was such a treat, after such a long time I could hear such a great master of music

04:38:56.611 --> 04:39:01.771
tonight and you two all enjoyed very much, I could see the way you are glued to your

04:39:01.771 --> 04:39:02.771
places.

04:39:02.771 --> 04:39:12.611
I mean, I don't know how we are so lucky that we get all the talents, all the beautiful

04:39:12.611 --> 04:39:23.091
blessings, even in music which is very difficult to achieve in this far off place like a jungle.

04:39:23.091 --> 04:39:37.371
I hope you all have enjoyed it very much.

04:39:37.371 --> 04:39:48.411
I have now heard our Guruji's Guru and I have heard also his Guru, I am as old as that.

04:39:48.411 --> 04:40:00.451
And the beauty of his music is that he doesn't get, I should say, excited very much, very

04:40:00.451 --> 04:40:01.451
relaxed.

04:40:01.451 --> 04:40:05.771
His Guruji was used to rise about half way while singing.

04:40:05.771 --> 04:40:10.051
Of course he was very great singer, no doubt, but he used to do that way and then you come

04:40:10.051 --> 04:40:12.051
down and then again he used to rise.

04:40:12.051 --> 04:40:21.191
He is a very, very nice person, extremely nice and just lost in the music.

04:40:21.191 --> 04:40:29.171
Now after such a long time I could hear the echo of that great music and I must thank

04:40:29.171 --> 04:40:36.451
him very much for creating such good artists like our Guruji, his own son and the little

04:40:36.451 --> 04:40:44.051
one who has shown such miraculous powers.

04:40:44.051 --> 04:41:00.511
So we have to thank him very much, again and again, please give him a hand.

04:41:00.511 --> 04:41:10.791
Also he has promised to come with Babamama for Guru Puja, to Cabella.

04:41:10.791 --> 04:41:17.791
So now we'll have to have four days, Guru Puja, I think.

04:42:08.843 --> 04:42:13.483
Tomorrow, Indians are going to be given 

04:42:13.463 --> 04:42:18.173
the gift that you people from the west have brought very graciously. 

04:42:18.363 --> 04:42:21.573
So I would like to thank on their behalf for this

04:42:21.683 --> 04:42:26.323
beautiful presents you have brought for them. 

04:42:33.233 --> 04:42:38.235
So tomorrow morning the westerners or Australians, 

04:42:38.315 --> 04:42:42.445
or New Zealand, can have a nice sleep. They need not come.

04:42:42.471 --> 04:42:47.931
But if they want they can go to the seashore.

04:42:47.931 --> 04:42:54.831
But these presents will be distributed by Indians.

04:42:54.831 --> 04:43:10.191
And also if Gregore gets up, Guido the Great, Babamama has called you Ka Saab Guido.

04:43:10.191 --> 04:43:17.371
If they both are awake they are welcome because they are world leaders.

04:43:17.371 --> 04:43:19.871
They can help in the distribution.

04:43:19.871 --> 04:43:29.031
Of course Rajesh will be there no doubt, half asleep.

04:43:29.031 --> 04:43:35.791
So Mr. Jalan or Rajiv Kumar, I hope Rajiv Kumar has gone off to sleep, he couldn't.

04:43:35.791 --> 04:43:40.351
Jalan is still existing.

04:43:40.351 --> 04:43:46.031
Both of them have done a great job with Me, written down for everyone.

04:43:46.031 --> 04:43:51.831
And so I think the Westerners need not waste their time.

04:43:51.831 --> 04:43:53.774
They can enjoy themselves.
