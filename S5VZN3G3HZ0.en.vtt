02:31.909 --> 02:36.069
Today we are going to celebrate the

02:39.069 --> 02:41.099
birthday of Mahavira.

02:46.079 --> 02:50.969
Mahavira is the incarnation of Bhairavanath,

02:53.079 --> 02:55.929
or you call Him as Saint Michael.

02:58.009 --> 03:00.899
Now these two saints as you know

03:01.029 --> 03:03.969
one as the Gabriel, Hanumana,

03:04.059 --> 03:08.959
and another is Saint Michael.

03:11.059 --> 03:14.099
One is placed on the Pingala Nadi

03:14.969 --> 03:18.939
and another one, Saint Michael, on the Ida Nadi.

03:22.909 --> 03:23.089
So,

03:26.119 --> 03:28.009
Mahavira

03:31.959 --> 03:33.919
had to go through

03:35.089 --> 03:38.969
lots of search.

03:40.099 --> 03:43.089
Of course He was a

03:47.959 --> 03:50.929
angel, but came as human being

03:51.109 --> 03:54.949
and He had to find out

03:58.049 --> 04:03.049
the thing of the left side,

04:06.039 --> 04:08.909
and how the left side acts.

04:09.069 --> 04:15.019
It's a very complicated thing, left side,

04:15.949 --> 04:18.969
is much more complicated than right side.

04:19.899 --> 04:24.929
On the left side we have also seven nadis,

04:26.059 --> 04:34.919
and these seven nadis are placed one after another.

04:36.049 --> 04:39.939
They are described in books and given different names to them.

04:40.879 --> 04:45.029
Now these seven nadis that are on the left side,

04:46.089 --> 04:49.109
as you know, they cater to our past.

04:50.009 --> 04:54.049
Say for example, every moment becomes a past.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.999
Every present becomes a past.

05:00.059 --> 05:03.909
Then we have past of this lifetime,

05:04.079 --> 05:08.099
and also we have past of our previous lives.

05:09.019 --> 05:12.099
Then all the past is built in within us

05:12.969 --> 05:14.919
since our creation.

05:15.059 --> 05:18.929
So all the psychosomatic diseases, as you know,

05:19.039 --> 05:21.949
are only triggered by

05:23.069 --> 05:25.879
the entities that appear

05:25.979 --> 05:27.889
from the left side.

05:28.039 --> 05:32.039
For a person, supposing he is suffering, say, from liver trouble

05:34.089 --> 05:37.879
and suddenly he's attacked from the left side,

05:38.949 --> 05:40.099
specially Mooladhara,

05:41.979 --> 05:45.939
or any left side, left Nabhi,

05:47.019 --> 05:50.899
because Mooladhara is the only one that is connected

05:51.019 --> 05:53.939
with the left side, Ida Nadi,

05:54.079 --> 05:57.009
and the right side PingalaNadi

05:57.109 --> 05:59.949
is connected with Swadisthana.

06:00.049 --> 06:05.929
So the problems of Mooladhara

06:07.889 --> 06:11.909
are really beyond the reach of human beings,

06:13.039 --> 06:15.079
and when it is attacked,

06:15.949 --> 06:17.949
any one of these chakras on the left-hand side,

06:20.919 --> 06:23.079
then psychosomatic diseases

06:24.079 --> 06:26.939
occur into human beings.

06:27.069 --> 06:29.119
As I have told you many-a-times, now this is the center,

06:29.949 --> 06:31.989
this is the another center, left and right,

06:32.079 --> 06:34.049
they are on top of each other.

06:34.889 --> 06:36.099
And using the right side too much,

06:36.929 --> 06:38.919
goes up to a point and suddenly something happens

06:38.979 --> 06:40.949
on the left, triggers.

06:41.059 --> 06:45.069
So all diseases, say even diabetes,

06:47.039 --> 06:50.959
is due to the psychosomatic efect.

06:52.019 --> 06:54.119
A person who is very hard-working, thinks too much,

06:54.929 --> 06:55.939
very right-sided,

06:56.009 --> 06:57.959
suddenly something happens,

06:58.049 --> 07:00.949
maybe also he might inherit that diabetes

07:01.029 --> 07:03.899
because of the past, and it triggers

07:03.999 --> 07:06.939
and you get this psychosomatic problem.

07:07.049 --> 07:09.109
Now this psychosomatic problem

07:11.999 --> 07:13.939
is only cured if you know

07:14.029 --> 07:16.119
what's the problem of the left side is.

07:19.879 --> 07:23.959
So Mahavira went quite deep on to the left side.

07:24.099 --> 07:27.949
Why I said it's difficult the left side is, because

07:28.069 --> 07:30.889
when you start moving on the left side

07:31.989 --> 07:34.949
the movement becomes linear of course,

07:35.049 --> 07:37.099
but it moves downward,

07:37.989 --> 07:42.099
while the movement on the right side moves upward.

07:42.949 --> 07:45.889
So the movement goes down like that,

07:48.079 --> 07:52.889
and then it coils up,

07:53.999 --> 07:55.889
forms coils,

07:56.889 --> 07:58.909
and you go on moving with it

07:59.019 --> 08:01.919
so you are lost in the coil.

08:02.879 --> 08:06.889
But the other one moves upward

08:06.969 --> 08:08.969
and the coils are not so many,

08:09.059 --> 08:12.019
and because it is upward it's easy to get out of it.

08:15.049 --> 08:17.939
So those people who go to the left,

08:18.039 --> 08:22.939
by any chance, by thinking too much about their past,

08:23.009 --> 08:25.999
crying about themselves and always complaining,

08:27.069 --> 08:30.089
are more difficult than the people on the right side.

08:32.099 --> 08:35.909
But the right side people are troublesome to others,

08:36.009 --> 08:38.929
while the left side people are troublesome to themselves.

08:39.069 --> 08:41.109
That's how this left side

08:41.979 --> 08:45.899
was to be found out properly, was done by Mahavira.

08:46.999 --> 08:49.959
Of course He knew also, I think, all about it.

08:50.099 --> 08:56.889
So He has mentioned practically, in details,

08:56.959 --> 08:59.929
lots of things that can happen to a person

09:00.029 --> 09:01.929
who goes to the left side.

09:02.039 --> 09:04.009
He gave the idea of hell.

09:05.119 --> 09:08.939
He also described seven types of hell.

09:09.959 --> 09:12.989
I mean it's so horrible that I don't want to tell you

09:13.069 --> 09:15.069
what is hell is,

09:15.969 --> 09:17.999
horrifyingly cruel,

09:18.089 --> 09:20.109
horrifyingly joyless

09:20.969 --> 09:22.979
and horrifyingly

09:25.889 --> 09:27.099
so repulsive that

09:27.939 --> 09:30.069
you hate yourself when you understand

09:30.899 --> 09:32.119
you have committed this mistake,

09:32.969 --> 09:35.099
you have committed this pap,  this

09:38.949 --> 09:39.979
sin;

09:40.059 --> 09:43.049
and then what is the result,

09:43.899 --> 09:45.959
what you get - the punishment part.

09:46.059 --> 09:48.059
Mahavira worked it out everything,

09:48.879 --> 09:52.089
He has given in all details what sort of punishment

09:52.919 --> 09:56.949
is due to a human being who tries to be left-sided.

09:57.039 --> 10:02.019
Also He has given about the person who is right-sided,

10:02.109 --> 10:04.059
but not to that extent

10:04.119 --> 10:06.929
because He had to deal with the combination,

10:07.009 --> 10:08.979
but mostly with the left side.

10:09.069 --> 10:13.889
As I have told many people before and here also I perhaps maybe,

10:14.909 --> 10:18.939
that there is a soul that is

10:19.899 --> 10:23.059
made out of the causal bodies

10:24.029 --> 10:27.959
of all the five elements.

10:28.079 --> 10:32.099
The causal, say for example, of the earth is fragrance.

10:33.909 --> 10:35.089
So this

10:38.919 --> 10:41.999
soul which is made of the five causal bodies

10:42.069 --> 10:43.919
and your centers,

10:44.939 --> 10:48.999
plus we can say, also

10:52.029 --> 10:56.959
it has got the control over the parasympathetic,

11:00.029 --> 11:06.069
it sits on the spinal cord from outside

11:07.049 --> 11:11.039
and activates the parasympathetic nervous system.

11:12.099 --> 11:15.939
So it has a connection with every center.

11:19.009 --> 11:21.079
Now this is the soul when we die,

11:21.979 --> 11:31.019
with the Kundalini and our Spirit goes into the sky

11:31.109 --> 11:34.999
and it is the soul that guides now

11:35.109 --> 11:39.069
the movement of our being, whatever is left now

11:39.919 --> 11:42.939
into a new being and that's how it works out.

11:43.089 --> 11:46.059
So everything that we have done so far

11:46.119 --> 11:48.079
is recorded in that soul.

11:49.879 --> 11:52.979
When you were asking Me, "Mother, we see some sort of

11:53.079 --> 11:56.109
round, round things, you see, lying together.

11:56.939 --> 11:57.999
What is that?"

11:58.109 --> 12:01.019
I told you this is our, this is a dead soul.

12:01.999 --> 12:06.099
And now they have found out what I have told them.

12:07.999 --> 12:11.979
Because, you see, when a person dies

12:12.959 --> 12:17.059
his soul shows you - like even now you can see,

12:17.879 --> 12:19.059
round, round things:

12:19.919 --> 12:24.029
there could be many, there could be one, a string -

12:26.939 --> 12:30.959
and they saw it under a microscope when I told them,

12:31.079 --> 12:39.039
that the soul within us is reflected on the cell,

12:39.989 --> 12:44.039
which is the reflector of every cell.

12:44.899 --> 12:48.049
So the part of the cell which is the reflector,

12:49.039 --> 12:56.069
which is placed on one side of the cell

12:58.029 --> 13:04.989
also has this soul reflected,

13:05.109 --> 13:09.989
and the main soul which is on the back

13:10.089 --> 13:12.119
controls that

13:17.059 --> 13:21.939
reflected soul which looks after every cell.

13:22.069 --> 13:26.939
Now they have found out that there is in that reflector

13:27.919 --> 13:30.989
this kind of seven loops,

13:31.069 --> 13:34.879
seven loops because it sits on the eight â€“

13:35.999 --> 13:38.919
seven chakras and the Mooladhara.

13:40.989 --> 13:43.029
Now what He found out that,

13:43.899 --> 13:45.059
when people die

13:45.899 --> 13:47.099
then some of the souls

13:50.079 --> 13:56.919
are born again just after few days,

13:57.939 --> 14:01.919
and these people are just very ordinary type of people,

14:02.009 --> 14:05.969
that's how He brought in a kind of category.

14:06.059 --> 14:09.099
So they are - the people who have died -

14:10.089 --> 14:13.949
they are of a category, one category,

14:14.019 --> 14:20.079
where they exist for a very short time

14:21.109 --> 14:23.119
in the collective subconscious

14:23.939 --> 14:25.099
and then they take their rebirth.

14:32.899 --> 14:34.939
They are very ordinary people,

14:35.029 --> 14:37.099
aimless, useless people.

14:38.899 --> 14:41.049
But there are some souls when they die,

14:41.909 --> 14:43.119
they just hang in the air

14:43.929 --> 14:46.099
and they are just waiting to find out somebody

14:46.929 --> 14:50.059
who will fulfill their desires

14:50.889 --> 14:52.989
which are not yet fulfilled.

14:54.929 --> 14:57.089
Like there's a drunkard and a drunkard,

14:57.919 --> 15:02.889
can join another human being who's living,

15:02.949 --> 15:04.089
who would like to drink.

15:04.919 --> 15:06.889
So once he starts getting this...

15:31.899 --> 15:33.039
So once it starts

15:44.109 --> 15:51.069
getting into the habit of drinking,

15:52.099 --> 15:55.879
some of these souls can just jump on that person,

15:55.999 --> 15:58.049
and when they jump on that person

15:59.079 --> 16:02.069
they can make him a real drunkard.

16:03.109 --> 16:06.939
I remember of a lady who was a very short, petite person,

16:06.999 --> 16:07.999
came from Cuba,

16:08.089 --> 16:10.109
in America when I went first,

16:10.109 --> 16:14.049
and she told Me that she's very sick of herself.

16:14.899 --> 16:16.939
And her husband told Me that she can take

16:17.009 --> 16:21.949
one whisky bottle, full, neat sometimes.

16:22.939 --> 16:25.939
Looked at her, such a little thing. I said "How can she do it?"

16:27.039 --> 16:34.929
So, I put a bandhan on her and I saw a huge big Negro

16:34.999 --> 16:36.109
standing behind her.

16:36.969 --> 16:38.919
So I said, "Do you know some Negro?"

16:38.999 --> 16:40.949
Immediately she jumped on Me. She said,

16:41.009 --> 16:42.069
"Mother, You see that one?

16:42.899 --> 16:45.889
You see that one, that's the one drinks, not me."

16:46.969 --> 16:49.099
Of course I cured her

16:49.909 --> 16:51.959
and after that she gave up drinking completely.

16:52.049 --> 16:58.909
So whenever you start getting into a habit in a bad way,

16:59.899 --> 17:02.979
you lose complete control of yourself

17:03.079 --> 17:08.029
and a spirit sits on you, and it controls you.

17:10.889 --> 17:12.029
And when it controls you,

17:13.009 --> 17:16.909
you do not know how to get rid of any habit.

17:16.999 --> 17:19.899
That's why it's difficult to get rid of habits.

17:19.959 --> 17:22.949
Now in Sahaja Yoga when the Kundalini rises what happens

17:23.989 --> 17:27.959
that these spirits, these dead spirits

17:28.029 --> 17:31.039
leave you and you become all right and you give up.

17:31.099 --> 17:32.939
That's how it works.

17:37.079 --> 17:40.019
I would say that all this Mahavira did not tell,

17:40.979 --> 17:42.989
nor did He find out all these things,

17:43.989 --> 17:46.919
because He was not a scientist, I think, or I don't know why.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.929
But what He has talked about is the hell.

17:50.019 --> 17:54.929
And He has said that if you do this kind of thing

17:55.019 --> 17:59.069
in your lifetime, then what kind of a hell you'll get,

17:59.929 --> 18:02.899
and He has described the hell in a very,

18:06.889 --> 18:10.889
I should say, openly and in a very detailed manner.

18:10.969 --> 18:13.039
And it's really horrible to know

18:13.879 --> 18:16.049
that a human being who thinks no end of himself

18:16.929 --> 18:19.099
ultimately will get to that kind of a hell

18:19.929 --> 18:22.059
and some are permanently doomed to be there.

18:24.079 --> 18:26.879
But as incarnations take birth,

18:26.949 --> 18:28.909
also these devils, some of them

18:28.989 --> 18:32.039
who are completely doomed to live in hell,

18:32.109 --> 18:34.039
also take their birth.

18:35.109 --> 18:39.919
And when they take their birth, they try to trouble us,

18:39.999 --> 18:43.039
and they can take birth as, as you know, as our gurus

18:43.099 --> 18:45.939
and things. And everything is happening now,

18:46.019 --> 18:49.919
you find it how these people are taking their birth

18:50.019 --> 18:51.989
and how they are misleading us.

18:52.099 --> 18:55.939
How they are using the left Swadisthana

18:55.999 --> 18:59.059
or we can call it the left side

18:59.119 --> 19:04.109
just to immobilize us completely.

19:04.969 --> 19:07.959
So when a person is possessed, as you must have seen,

19:08.029 --> 19:11.919
a person gets possessed he cannot feel vibrations -

19:11.999 --> 19:15.939
there are all kinds of symptoms about such a person.

19:16.919 --> 19:18.889
But in Sahaja Yoga what do we do

19:18.949 --> 19:20.919
is to take the name of Mahavira,

19:21.009 --> 19:26.059
because Mahavira runs all the way, all the way on the Ida Nadi

19:26.879 --> 19:31.049
and comes and stays here onto the -

19:31.999 --> 19:36.999
we can say the point which is for our superego.

19:38.009 --> 19:41.059
And it sees, controls, works out, cleanses

19:41.889 --> 19:43.899
and does all that is required

19:43.959 --> 19:46.109
to put a person right after Sahaja Yoga.

19:46.939 --> 19:49.959
So we have to be really very thankful to Him

19:50.049 --> 19:54.939
for doing this kind of work which is very filthy and dirty;

19:54.999 --> 19:57.109
because these people don't mind even

19:57.929 --> 20:00.909
sitting in the bathroom, like that you can say,

20:00.979 --> 20:03.979
or sitting with everything and meditating.

20:04.039 --> 20:06.059
They can do anything, they are very dirty people,

20:06.119 --> 20:07.969
absolutely dirty.

20:08.029 --> 20:11.059
When they become tantrikas they try all kinds of dirty things,

20:11.119 --> 20:14.939
and with that they actually create a problem

20:15.009 --> 20:18.019
between themselves and the God.

20:19.979 --> 20:22.049
Say they'll go to a temple of a Goddess

20:22.109 --> 20:24.119
and start misbehaving with a woman there,

20:24.949 --> 20:26.939
so the Goddess will disappear;

20:27.019 --> 20:29.039
and once the Goddess disappears in that area,

20:29.109 --> 20:32.889
they call all these bhoots from the left side.

20:32.989 --> 20:37.019
So now we have all these souls which are lying, hanging in the air,

20:37.109 --> 20:39.119
trying to come back

20:39.979 --> 20:46.079
to a conscious thing and to possess someone.

20:46.919 --> 20:50.099
Plus these, we have these masters of the left side

20:50.919 --> 20:53.909
who know how to catch hold of these people

20:53.989 --> 20:56.029
and put them on somebody,

20:56.099 --> 21:00.019
or to remove from them someone and to put somebody else.

21:00.099 --> 21:02.059
So it's a continuous process,

21:02.879 --> 21:06.949
and this makes a person absolutely mad and good for nothing.

21:08.069 --> 21:10.089
Now when we know all this,

21:10.949 --> 21:13.889
still we get caught up on the left side.

21:13.969 --> 21:15.989
Sahaja Yogis do get caught up.

21:16.059 --> 21:19.919
That's why I think this Mahavira Jayanti

21:19.989 --> 21:23.929
is a very, very great day for us to observe.

21:23.999 --> 21:26.059
Now why was He called Mahavira?

21:26.899 --> 21:32.899
Because only a person like Him - Vir means a person who is brave,

21:32.979 --> 21:36.979
who is chivalrous - because only He could do this.

21:37.059 --> 21:41.119
So only He could enter into the being fully

21:41.959 --> 21:46.119
and could kill or you can say destroy

21:46.959 --> 21:50.019
those horrible rakshasas, devils,

21:50.089 --> 21:53.019
all these negative things that come to us.

21:54.019 --> 21:56.949
Now as you know we use left side very much

21:57.009 --> 22:00.009
for so many negativity that is torturing us;

22:00.079 --> 22:02.989
but if there is no help,

22:03.079 --> 22:06.019
say, from Mahavira we cannot do it.

22:06.099 --> 22:07.949
We  call the name of Mahavira -

22:08.009 --> 22:10.949
you could call Him Saint Michael, you can call Him by any name,

22:10.949 --> 22:13.089
but Mahavira because He was a human being.

22:14.109 --> 22:17.929
All this works out because of Him

22:17.999 --> 22:19.979
and He is such a great identity.

22:20.059 --> 22:22.959
He, Himself took a birth as a human being.

22:23.029 --> 22:26.909
Difficult for saints to take birth as human being.

22:27.009 --> 22:30.119
Moreover, you see, the

22:31.109 --> 22:35.019
whole concept

22:37.949 --> 22:40.969
of hell and all that is described

22:41.059 --> 22:45.019
in any scripture is a fact: it exists.

22:45.999 --> 22:48.929
And if you try to go in there, you see,

22:48.999 --> 22:51.919
when I try to go there and to find out,

22:51.989 --> 22:55.939
I just go off to sleep sort of thing. In My sleep I find out

22:56.019 --> 22:58.029
all the things that are happening about a person,

22:58.119 --> 23:00.909
how much he's caught up, what he's done.

23:00.969 --> 23:04.939
It's a - not a easy thing to do with the conscious mind.

23:05.009 --> 23:07.049
You have to take to the subconscious

23:07.119 --> 23:09.989
and you have to go into sushupti, in a deeper sleep

23:10.049 --> 23:12.909
to see what's happening in the left side.

23:12.969 --> 23:16.899
It's a very funny situation, I think,

23:16.979 --> 23:20.979
and for Sahaja Yogis also to enter in it, I would not advise it.

23:21.059 --> 23:24.059
But one should get rid of the problems of the left side

23:24.119 --> 23:26.069
with the help of Mahavira.

23:26.889 --> 23:29.939
When this chakra is caught up what you find is a big

23:31.959 --> 23:34.099
lump of bone coming out on the right side.

23:35.989 --> 23:38.069
So you have to take the name of Mahavira

23:38.889 --> 23:42.909
just to remove that pressure from the left side.

23:42.979 --> 23:45.909
Now many people do not even know why they suffer:

23:45.979 --> 23:48.119
Why should they suffer when they have done nothing wrong?

23:48.939 --> 23:51.879
Because they are possessed.

23:52.099 --> 23:54.979
Now even the viruses and all these things

23:55.049 --> 23:59.089
like psychosomatic troubles, like cancer -

23:59.899 --> 24:02.119
all, I would say the incurable diseases

24:02.939 --> 24:07.069
are there because we are triggered into the left side,

24:07.899 --> 24:10.979
and that's why we are suffering from these diseases

24:11.059 --> 24:12.939
which are not curable.

24:13.979 --> 24:16.899
So we have to thank really very much Mahavira

24:16.969 --> 24:19.069
who has given us this power

24:19.889 --> 24:21.999
to remove our left-sided problems,

24:22.059 --> 24:27.959
who has given us this light in our hand,

24:28.929 --> 24:31.079
which He Himself vibrates

24:31.909 --> 24:35.919
and He, Himself tries to throw some light

24:36.019 --> 24:39.119
on the obscure things - about Me also.

24:41.029 --> 24:44.079
Because of Him only

24:45.089 --> 24:48.909
we can get cured

24:49.019 --> 24:53.089
of so many physical and mental troubles.

24:54.079 --> 24:57.119
You know that the left side can be easily cured

24:57.119 --> 25:00.119
if you use three-candle treatment.

25:00.939 --> 25:04.069
That shows Mahavira is only fond of light,

25:04.069 --> 25:05.979
He doesn't like darkness.

25:06.039 --> 25:10.969
And His idea is, I think that way,

25:11.029 --> 25:16.089
is to now fully go all the way

25:16.909 --> 25:19.909
to clear the left side as far as possible,

25:20.909 --> 25:23.879
to help Sahaja Yoga to be established

25:23.939 --> 25:29.929
in countries where I find still lot of this negativity is there,

25:30.019 --> 25:31.879
lot of it.

25:31.959 --> 25:33.939
So He is working it out, everywhere,

25:33.999 --> 25:37.019
and the psychosomatic diseases and all these diseases

25:37.079 --> 25:40.119
also we can work it out with candle light and all that,

25:40.939 --> 25:43.079
with three-candle we can do this treatment.

25:43.909 --> 25:47.939
So we have to be very thankful to Him

25:48.029 --> 25:51.909
that He has achieved this kind of entry

25:51.969 --> 25:54.079
into the left side and has found out for us

25:54.889 --> 25:59.999
what sort of problems exist on the left side.

26:02.089 --> 26:05.909
It's such a nice thing that we have got today the chance

26:05.969 --> 26:08.959
to celebrate His birthday here

26:09.029 --> 26:12.919
in a place which is really very much loved by Him.

26:13.889 --> 26:16.069
Now we may say that Mahavira is sometimes seen

26:16.879 --> 26:19.049
as a person who is naked.

26:19.109 --> 26:23.919
So it happened that He had gone in a jungle to meditate

26:23.979 --> 26:26.109
and to find out about the left side

26:26.919 --> 26:28.959
and when He got up, you see,

26:29.889 --> 26:32.979
He got caught up in one of the bushes

26:33.059 --> 26:40.899
and He had to torn off half part of that.

26:41.889 --> 26:45.099
When that half part was torn off,

26:46.069 --> 26:50.959
then He came out of those bushes and He was all right,

26:51.929 --> 26:55.019
but at the same time Shri Krishna appeared there on the scene

26:55.099 --> 26:57.119
as a little boy from a village

26:57.929 --> 27:00.949
and He said that "I'm a poor man,"

27:01.009 --> 27:04.899
this little boy said, "I am a poor person, I have nothing with Me.

27:04.959 --> 27:07.029
You are a king. You can always get your clothes.

27:07.099 --> 27:12.899
Why don't you give Me Your, this half cloth that You have?"

27:14.019 --> 27:20.089
And, they say so that it was given to this boy

27:20.919 --> 27:22.089
and who ran away.

27:22.919 --> 27:24.079
He was nobody else but Shri Vishnu.

27:26.059 --> 27:32.019
And this, you see, Vishnu took away that cloth

27:32.019 --> 27:35.949
and of hardly for about two seconds or three seconds

27:35.949 --> 27:37.959
because He was a king you see,

27:38.029 --> 27:40.009
and He hid Himself with leaves

27:40.069 --> 27:42.929
and He went to His palace and got dressed.

27:42.989 --> 27:45.889
But imagine, the people, how negative they are.

27:45.959 --> 27:49.119
They just walk without clothes - Jainies.

27:49.939 --> 27:54.009
They have, you see, all kinds of taboos

27:54.069 --> 27:57.059
against all the worms, everything.

27:58.039 --> 28:00.929
It's said, these people have started,

28:00.989 --> 28:03.979
that if you do not respect these little, little animals,

28:04.049 --> 28:08.969
like you can a, even serpent

28:09.959 --> 28:14.909
or any animal which is troublesome and bad,

28:14.979 --> 28:21.949
but is a living thing, so it's to be preserved.

28:22.059 --> 28:24.059
Now these Jains are mad.

28:24.899 --> 28:27.909
I told you that they have gone to such a limit of vegetarianism

28:27.989 --> 28:30.059
that they try to save even the bugs,

28:30.059 --> 28:32.019
put the bugs in a hut,

28:32.099 --> 28:36.919
and the hut has got a brahmin there.

28:36.989 --> 28:41.069
Now these bugs suck the blood of this brahmin

28:41.889 --> 28:44.029
and once the brahmin is

28:45.899 --> 28:47.999
completely, I mean I should say, sucked in

28:48.059 --> 28:50.089
by these bugs, they fall on the ground.

28:50.909 --> 28:53.109
Then they allow the brahmin to come out

28:53.109 --> 28:55.959
and they give him a lot of dakshina, means

28:55.959 --> 28:58.009
they give him money as a reward

28:58.069 --> 29:01.029
for helping the bugs to suck his blood.

29:02.029 --> 29:04.079
This kind of vegetarianism is there.

29:04.079 --> 29:07.949
Beware of vegetarians. You see even Hitler was a vegetarian

29:08.029 --> 29:10.959
so you can imagine what sort of a vegetarianism it is.

29:11.029 --> 29:13.939
All these fads of vegetarianism and all that

29:14.009 --> 29:15.969
are not at all required,

29:16.029 --> 29:20.959
and that's what Mahavira showed in His life,

29:21.019 --> 29:25.979
that it is not at all important to bother about food,

29:26.049 --> 29:27.989
what they should eat.

29:29.049 --> 29:34.059
See, the whole theory of this vegetarianism has gone

29:34.889 --> 29:39.909
to such a nonsensical limits that I have told people

29:39.909 --> 29:42.119
that we should give up vegetarianism, completely.

29:43.899 --> 29:48.009
Now also see the juxtaposition of what He wanted to do.

29:49.009 --> 29:52.899
If you do not eat proteins you cannot fight bhoots.

29:53.109 --> 29:56.879
A person who has bhoots in him must eat a lot of proteins,

29:56.939 --> 29:59.079
not carbohydrates but proteins, so that

29:59.899 --> 30:03.109
it can fight those left-sided enemies.

30:03.929 --> 30:06.929
But here it is they have to be vegetarians.

30:06.989 --> 30:10.029
Now imagine they have left-sided enemies within them

30:10.099 --> 30:12.029
and they want to be vegetarians.

30:12.029 --> 30:14.879
Finished. How will they fight it?

30:15.909 --> 30:18.919
So all this is all we should say is pre-planned

30:18.979 --> 30:23.969
by the person who tries to, sort of say is -

30:23.969 --> 30:27.009
we can say like that, you see, a person

30:27.069 --> 30:28.879
who tries to remove the -

30:34.099 --> 30:38.999
or we can say that the person who tries to make the,

30:40.109 --> 30:43.899
these lower animals live,

30:43.959 --> 30:46.029
rather than human beings, you see they're oppressors.

30:46.089 --> 30:48.949
This is the stupid thing they do.

30:49.019 --> 30:53.109
Must know that I cannot give Realization to these worms

30:53.929 --> 30:58.969
and to these fishes, or even to chickens.

30:59.979 --> 31:01.939
We require human beings.

31:02.979 --> 31:10.099
So all this has happened because of human beings

31:10.919 --> 31:14.879
going in juxtaposition of whatever is said.

31:14.969 --> 31:18.999
Like Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,"

31:19.079 --> 31:22.069
and I've yet to come across a Christian

31:22.889 --> 31:26.879
who is not a Sahaja Yogi, without adulterous eyes,

31:26.959 --> 31:28.909
whether it's a woman or a man.

31:30.929 --> 31:34.979
So we go just the opposite of what we have been taught.

31:35.049 --> 31:38.909
In the case of same thing happened that Mahavira,

31:39.939 --> 31:43.909
what He tried to do was absolutely killed

31:43.979 --> 31:47.889
by these people who are trying

31:47.949 --> 31:51.979
to make this vegetarianism as a big religion.

31:52.949 --> 31:57.929
Also another thing was that this vegetarianism

31:57.989 --> 32:01.899
came into Jainism through one fellow called Neminath

32:01.969 --> 32:06.949
who was a tirthankar at the time of Shri Krishna.

32:07.079 --> 32:10.089
He was to be married. In those days they were married,

32:10.919 --> 32:13.109
not only but they were eating all kinds of meats

32:13.929 --> 32:18.059
and so many lambs and goats came for the wedding of this man

32:18.889 --> 32:22.889
so he felt that - uparati we call it, this:

32:22.889 --> 32:26.109
he didn't like it, he was disgusted, he was frustrated with that.

32:26.929 --> 32:28.929
With that frustration what did he do?

32:30.019 --> 32:32.949
He said, "I will not eat meat."

32:33.049 --> 32:36.889
And that's how vegetarianism started among Jainies.

32:36.969 --> 32:39.079
And that's how it's still going on,

32:39.899 --> 32:42.109
and these Jainies I find are the joyless people,

32:42.919 --> 32:44.079
absolutely joyless.

32:44.979 --> 32:48.019
They're so much fond of money, they run after the money

32:48.089 --> 32:52.009
and they go on behaving in such a peculiar way

32:52.079 --> 32:54.019
that you can't understand, I mean they are

32:54.079 --> 32:57.069
human beings but the way they behave you can't

32:57.899 --> 32:58.979
understand them, they're not normal people.

33:00.919 --> 33:02.039
So we realize

33:02.879 --> 33:05.019
that despite all that Mahavira worked out,

33:05.089 --> 33:12.939
still the people are supposed to be His disciples,

33:13.019 --> 33:15.099
they are Jains, and they are like this.

33:16.119 --> 33:19.899
So what we have to do now is to understand

33:19.979 --> 33:23.009
that in Sahaja Yoga we'd better not do something of that kind.

33:23.109 --> 33:27.919
Whatever you are told, you have to understand why it is so,

33:27.979 --> 33:29.109
you know the modus operandi,

33:29.929 --> 33:31.879
you know each and everything about Sahaja Yoga.

33:31.949 --> 33:33.079
You know the whole subject

33:33.919 --> 33:37.039
so it's not proper for you to in any way,

33:37.099 --> 33:39.929
to succumb to any such arguments

33:39.999 --> 33:42.099
or any such big, big talks or big, big

33:42.909 --> 33:46.929
advertisement and take to something that is wrong.

33:47.029 --> 33:48.889
It's very important.

33:50.919 --> 33:54.009
We are Sahaja Yogis and we understand the balance.

33:54.089 --> 33:58.029
Of course I always say that Westerners for example,

33:58.089 --> 33:59.939
maybe Australians also,

33:59.999 --> 34:03.019
should take more to carbohydrates because they eat a lot of meat.

34:03.119 --> 34:05.909
So they can take to carbohydrates,

34:05.969 --> 34:08.119
but that doesn't mean vegetarianism by any chance.

34:08.939 --> 34:10.119
I mean, to compensate.

34:10.939 --> 34:13.969
And in India I always say they must take to more meats,

34:14.039 --> 34:16.059
as will do, do them good.

34:16.879 --> 34:20.899
But then by no means I say that you just eat meat and nothing else.

34:20.959 --> 34:23.079
But a balance has to be found out,

34:23.889 --> 34:25.019
and once you strike it

34:25.079 --> 34:29.929
then you'll be surprised that you'll feel so relaxed, so much better,

34:30.079 --> 34:32.079
so much enlightened

34:32.899 --> 34:36.019
and the vibrations will flow much better than normally.

34:36.119 --> 34:38.939
So for food, you have to be careful.

34:38.999 --> 34:40.109
Same about with clothes

34:40.929 --> 34:44.089
that you shouldn't go mad after a suit all the time

34:44.899 --> 34:47.069
whether it's hot or cold or indifferent.

34:47.889 --> 34:51.059
What you have to do is to wear something that will suit you.

34:51.889 --> 34:53.119
Now for example, in a climate like this

34:53.929 --> 34:57.029
you may require a suit or something to cover yourself,

34:57.089 --> 34:59.899
but supposing you are in Ganapatipule

34:59.969 --> 35:03.089
or some place like that where it's not so cold

35:03.909 --> 35:06.099
or so hot, maybe it's dry.

35:06.919 --> 35:09.929
So what sort of a dress you should wear which is comfortable,

35:09.999 --> 35:11.019
that should be found out.

35:11.089 --> 35:12.939
And whatever you find out

35:13.009 --> 35:15.039
that this is such a comfortable dress for us,

35:15.099 --> 35:16.999
you'd better do it.

35:17.079 --> 35:22.889
Because what I have seen in many - you see, it's a thing that

35:22.959 --> 35:24.929
whenever I tell you something,

35:25.009 --> 35:27.009
don't take it to the extremes

35:27.069 --> 35:29.009
and don't take a little bit of it.

35:29.089 --> 35:32.119
But when I tell you this thing, you must understand

35:32.929 --> 35:35.949
that whatever is good for you,

35:36.019 --> 35:40.899
whatever is your temperament, whatever is aptitude,

35:40.969 --> 35:44.059
you have to take something that will nourish that,

35:44.119 --> 35:47.119
that will improve you and give you a balance.

35:47.939 --> 35:50.999
So to balance yourself, if you think of Mahavira

35:51.059 --> 35:54.969
you must think also of Shri Hanumana,

35:55.059 --> 35:57.119
both these things are important.

35:57.939 --> 36:00.099
It's not easy to tell all about Mahavira in this short lecture,

36:01.929 --> 36:05.999
but I think I have quite connected Him now with Sahaj,

36:06.059 --> 36:09.939
and you must have seen to it that how important He is

36:09.999 --> 36:11.989
and what an important role He plays.

36:13.009 --> 36:14.969
So May God bless you.

36:15.879 --> 36:18.999
Just start thinking about Mahavira I just,

36:19.069 --> 36:21.999
it's impossible to keep into the conscious mind,

36:22.059 --> 36:24.099
it's just going into the left all the time.

36:24.919 --> 36:27.979
Because I just in the car thought I'd better think about Mahavira

36:28.069 --> 36:31.909
and since then it's all going towards the left, it's so difficult.

36:31.999 --> 36:33.929
But it will work out.

36:54.929 --> 36:56.109
May God bless you!

37:02.119 --> 37:04.999
Terrible thing this left side is.

37:08.899 --> 37:11.979
I think if you have any problems you must ask Me also,

37:12.069 --> 37:14.879
because this is the only time

37:14.959 --> 37:16.919
when we can talk about things.

37:16.999 --> 37:20.009
If you have any problems you can ask Me, about left side:

37:23.949 --> 37:25.069
how to correct it,

37:25.949 --> 37:28.949
how to work it out, anything. Please ask Me.

37:31.109 --> 37:33.919
Because you always get this problem.

37:49.949 --> 37:53.099
What's it? Can't hear.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.079
A yogi asks about the feeling

38:03.059 --> 38:05.979
of pins and needles and the left heart

38:13.959 --> 38:19.999
Now heart as I told you is the reflection of God Almighty,

38:20.119 --> 38:21.999
which is the Spirit.

38:23.089 --> 38:27.899
So we have two types of heart troubles as I told you before also.

38:27.989 --> 38:33.049
One is, is when you have a overactive life, right-sided,

38:33.899 --> 38:36.039
and the left-sided is the lethargic heart

38:36.109 --> 38:38.019
when you get angina and all that.

38:38.019 --> 38:40.899
Now in your case, your case where you feel

38:40.899 --> 38:44.919
there is something pricking you,  that means it's a possession.

38:45.999 --> 38:49.909
If the hands are, sort of pins and needles

38:49.969 --> 38:51.949
then it's kind of possession.

38:54.999 --> 38:57.019
But it can be cleared out.

39:03.029 --> 39:04.959
Any other question?

39:05.089 --> 39:07.979
Can You say something about left Nabhi, Mother?

39:08.959 --> 39:11.019
That's a different area, though

39:11.879 --> 39:16.899
left Nabhi comes from the relationship

39:16.959 --> 39:19.009
between a wife and a husband mostly.

39:20.069 --> 39:24.939
But a wife who is a complaining type, is very sort of a,

39:28.009 --> 39:29.909
all the time grudging,

39:29.979 --> 39:32.069
very nervous and bothers the husband,

39:32.879 --> 39:35.949
frightened and all sorts of things that they do.

39:36.039 --> 39:39.119
You see just sometimes they do it just to trouble the husband,

39:39.939 --> 39:41.039
but sometimes basically

39:41.109 --> 39:43.989
they are very left-sided, possessed women.

39:49.059 --> 39:54.109
And these possessed women give you this left Nabhi.

39:54.949 --> 39:56.929
Any woman who feels the left Nabhi,

39:56.999 --> 40:00.109
she must immediately understand that there's some sort of

40:00.919 --> 40:05.019
a horrible thing in her being which has to go out.

40:05.079 --> 40:09.079
So for left Nabhi you must take to three candle treatment

40:09.919 --> 40:14.899
and try to respect your husband, try to be kind to him.

40:14.969 --> 40:17.889
Because these spirits can also dominate,

40:17.969 --> 40:21.029
you know, not that, they can make you very sly,

40:21.099 --> 40:24.059
they can also dominate, they have a way of dominating.

40:24.119 --> 40:27.909
So in any case it looks as if a woman

40:27.989 --> 40:29.889
might look to be right-sided,

40:29.959 --> 40:31.999
but actually she's suffering from left Nabhi

40:32.069 --> 40:34.059
and she's extremely dominating.

40:34.889 --> 40:37.119
In the same way, if the husband is not a good man

40:37.949 --> 40:40.969
and he tortures the wife and she feels unhappy about it

40:41.029 --> 40:42.929
and she's sorry about it,

40:42.989 --> 40:45.059
then also she catches the left Nahbi.

40:45.889 --> 40:47.999
So in both cases one has to understand

40:48.069 --> 40:50.999
that you get your joy,

40:51.069 --> 40:54.089
the source of joy is your Self, your own spirit.

40:54.919 --> 40:56.989
It doesn't depend on your husband or anyone,

40:57.049 --> 40:58.949
you are single that way.

40:59.029 --> 41:02.009
So you shouldn't worry about your husband,

41:02.079 --> 41:04.079
you shouldn't think how he treats you,

41:04.889 --> 41:06.979
you shouldn't bother at all about him.

41:07.039 --> 41:09.969
But what you have to think is that "After all, I'm his wife,

41:10.039 --> 41:12.089
I should support him, I should help him.

41:12.909 --> 41:14.049
Whatever way he is,

41:14.119 --> 41:16.929
let him be as he is,

41:16.999 --> 41:19.909
because he won't get corrected even if I tell him.

41:19.969 --> 41:22.349
So the best thing is I'd better not tell him anything.

41:22.374 --> 41:24.069
Let him do whatever he likes."

41:26.059 --> 41:30.029
And you clear out your left Nahbi with the candle.

41:30.109 --> 41:32.069
That's the way.

41:39.939 --> 41:42.989
All right, we'll get the children to wash My feet now.

41:46.109 --> 41:48.929
It's so very difficult, left side is still there. I'm just...

41:50.009 --> 41:51.069
Hello.

41:53.929 --> 41:56.969
You all get to come here to wash My feet â€“ all right?

41:57.109 --> 41:58.969
So beautiful!

42:07.929 --> 42:08.909
Mantras

42:19.969 --> 42:21.899
Ganesha Sthuthi

42:29.929 --> 42:31.959
Who knows all the Ganesha Sthuthi to be sung?

42:32.969 --> 42:34.909
Or you know Atharva Sheersh?

42:53.879 --> 42:55.899
Because Ganesha is the One, you see,

42:55.899 --> 42:57.879
who is sitting on Mooladhara,

42:57.879 --> 43:01.919
and it is He who is the One who puts you onto the left side.

43:01.919 --> 43:03.919
He throws you all the time.

43:04.909 --> 43:08.959
And it is Mahavira who tries to save you and to correct you.

43:09.959 --> 43:12.909
So there are two forces working.

43:25.109 --> 43:27.009
Take this.

50:13.989 --> 50:16.899
He says he has got the names of Bhairavanath,

50:17.039 --> 50:18.039
so itâ€™s very good.

50:18.889 --> 50:20.059
So you can come and wash My hands,

50:20.899 --> 50:22.109
those who are leaders here.

50:22.959 --> 50:26.109
Leaders! Big joke about them!

50:33.999 --> 50:37.899
Somebody should come here to put all the things.

50:39.099 --> 50:40.979
Who can do it?

51:26.529 --> 51:28.529
Now what â€“ somebody?

51:28.554 --> 51:30.534
One by one you can come and put the water in.

51:34.029 --> 51:35.939
Just put the water.

51:54.099 --> 51:56.979
No, no, not the â€¦ You have to do it.

51:59.979 --> 52:01.939
Now, one by one, come along.

52:07.119 --> 52:12.069
First of all is the honey. Call him.

53:40.989 --> 53:42.979
Take that one. This other one. â€¦

53:47.999 --> 53:49.099
We need you again. â€¦

53:53.159 --> 53:56.452
Be careful. It should not touch your fingers â€¦

53:56.969 --> 53:58.119
What is, this is clean?â€¦

54:00.919 --> 54:02.069
I thought it was â€¦

54:53.049 --> 54:55.019
From Melbourne, somebody can come â€¦

55:01.909 --> 55:03.021
What is that?

01:04:21.039 --> 01:04:23.889
These are the Ida Nadi names.

01:05:39.079 --> 01:05:40.879
Unmarried girls.

01:06:43.909 --> 01:06:45.959
With this finger you do like that, on both the sides.

01:06:48.889 --> 01:06:49.989
Debbie, come and do it.

01:06:57.969 --> 01:07:00.969
Yes, itâ€™s all right.

01:07:03.879 --> 01:07:07.049
Just beyond that. Just put the line like that.

01:10:01.119 --> 01:10:03.979
This side. Itâ€™s to be done like this.

01:10:06.949 --> 01:10:09.019
And on the back.

01:10:11.919 --> 01:10:14.949
You then have to put it under My, on the sole.

01:10:16.989 --> 01:10:19.079
You can move all the things.

01:10:21.009 --> 01:10:23.919
Are you doing on this side as well?

01:10:26.909 --> 01:10:30.019
Also down there. You have to complete as well.

01:10:33.009 --> 01:10:34.959
Thatâ€™s all done.

01:10:51.099 --> 01:10:55.039
To the line, up to the line you have to do the same thing.

01:10:57.959 --> 01:11:01.889
Whole thing up there. Yes. All right. And more.

01:11:18.929 --> 01:11:22.099
Just to the line, you just do that.

01:11:24.989 --> 01:11:27.979
Thatâ€™s good.

01:11:32.939 --> 01:11:34.899
Still complete it.

01:11:38.009 --> 01:11:40.879
Yes, correct. Yes, thatâ€™s it.

01:11:48.919 --> 01:11:51.949
I mean, whatever youâ€™ve put, more of that.

01:11:54.039 --> 01:11:57.979
Thatâ€™s it. Thatâ€™s correct.

01:12:06.939 --> 01:12:09.949
Now, I mean, extra that you have on My fingers â€“

01:12:09.949 --> 01:12:11.069
on My toes, just take it out.

01:12:28.999 --> 01:12:31.909
Now, can you get some married ladies also?

01:12:47.929 --> 01:12:50.049
Too much. With your hands, take it out.

01:12:51.099 --> 01:12:54.949
Thatâ€™s better. Take this also.

01:12:56.009 --> 01:13:00.059
Be careful. Donâ€™t spoil the line. Donâ€™t spoil the line.

01:13:01.989 --> 01:13:06.899
This line you should not spoil.

01:13:11.079 --> 01:13:14.949
Yes, be careful. Itâ€™s all right.

01:13:48.919 --> 01:13:50.929
Thereâ€™s so much to be done.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:55.939
Thereâ€™s a sari here. Just wipe your hand on this â€¦.

01:14:08.009 --> 01:14:10.069
Now, what you can do is to get the sari.

01:14:24.119 --> 01:14:25.979
Brought the sari?

01:16:05.879 --> 01:16:07.959
Take it down there. All right.

01:16:13.059 --> 01:16:15.959
Call one of them, who are other assisting, in front.

01:16:17.019 --> 01:16:18.109
The girls have to sit here.

01:16:31.939 --> 01:16:34.889
Yes, this one â€¦ Give it to her, with a â€¦

01:16:40.059 --> 01:16:43.039
You can take that coconut.

01:18:19.979 --> 01:18:21.089
Bangles.

01:19:15.119 --> 01:19:17.919
You see, there are small and big.

01:19:20.909 --> 01:19:22.919
because itâ€™s two-and-a-half â€¦

01:20:52.009 --> 01:20:53.919
Better let them come now.

01:20:56.949 --> 01:20:58.039
They have to come.

01:21:05.939 --> 01:21:07.999
You have to do the sari.

01:31:59.019 --> 01:32:01.089
Now you have to organise these flowers, under My feet,

01:32:02.099 --> 01:32:04.099
but all the white under My feet,

01:32:04.979 --> 01:32:06.089
ones on the side â€¦

01:32:16.949 --> 01:32:20.089
So you put all the white, and Iâ€™ll put My feet afterwards.

01:32:43.109 --> 01:32:45.019
Now the light colors, like pink.

01:40:09.049 --> 01:40:10.929
Leaders â€¦

01:47:31.879 --> 01:47:33.979
Namaskar â€¦

01:47:49.009 --> 01:47:52.979
May God bless you all. May God bless you.

01:48:03.899 --> 01:48:06.029
See how everything is quiet.

01:48:07.889 --> 01:48:09.899
Just before Aarti it started raining,

01:48:10.029 --> 01:48:13.879
and now see â€¦ beautiful. All right.

01:48:28.019 --> 01:48:34.019
You take a photograph of My feet? Just leave this â€¦
