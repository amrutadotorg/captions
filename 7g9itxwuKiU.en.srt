1
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:16,400
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,890
Speaking before the doctors,

3
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,520
I think of My college days,

4
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,560
while I was also studying medicine

5
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:36,600
but luckily or unluckily our college stopped completely,

6
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,730
in Lahore and I had to give up My studies.

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,230
Not that I had no faith in this western education of medicine

8
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,650
but it was a good chance by connecting this to that

9
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:01,940
and understanding what is missing in the western medical education.

10
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:12,190
The missing point is this,

11
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:19,810
that human beings are considered in the medical science

12
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,150
as something very individual

13
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,890
and not connected with the whole.

14
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:30,350
We are all connected with the whole.

15
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,440
But how to convince people

16
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,850
that you are all connected with the whole

17
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,560
and that you are not singled out?

18
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,440
As we are connected with the whole

19
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:54,650
all our problems are connected with the whole.

20
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,060
You cannot just consider somebody as the patient of one thing

21
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,480
and another patient of another thing,

22
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,310
could be that one person who has one trouble,

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,020
could be having so many other troubles,

24
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,480
so many other connections

25
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,150
which we do not locate in the western medical sience.

26
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:28,020
For example, to see a person

27
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,770
medically very sick, may be,

28
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,890
but you don't know, what is his mental condition?

29
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,150
What is he doing mentally?

30
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,150
Is he all right mentally

31
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:48,850
or only he is physically something wrong with him?

32
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,230
Now absolutely we know about so many things, like say,

33
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,980
medically we have names for that,

34
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,520
that this is a psychosomatic problem

35
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,480
or this is a somatic problem,

36
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:16,520
but what is the relationship between the two that we don't know.

37
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:23,270
You'll be amazed most of our diseases come from psychosomatic,

38
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:29,520
like cancer, which are incurable mostly, cancer

39
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,270
and we can say AIDS,

40
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:39,520
all such which are supposed to be absolutely incurable

41
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,650
and difficult,

42
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:46,310
all that come with our connection, with our connection,

43
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,150
which we are not sure of,

44
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,690
with the left side. As we, you have seen here  in picture, left side,

45
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,060
I don't know.

46
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,730
We know only the right side medical science

47
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,310
and that too in such details,

48
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,600
it is not necessary,

49
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,560
you must also know the left side of a human being

50
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,940
and about left side we are absolutely not aware.

51
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,560
For example, a person who is mad,

52
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,730
lunatic, he is in the lunatic asylum.

53
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,770
He doesn't get heart trouble, why?

54
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,770
How has he got mad? What is his connection

55
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,520
with ourselves?

56
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,730
For example, you take a patient

57
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,060
who is suffering, say, from cancer.

58
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,270
We know a lot about cancer, no doubt,

59
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,020
how virus is started and all that, that we know.

60
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,940
But how cancer is caused no one knows

61
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,730
and to what type of people cancer comes in, you don't know.

62
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:27,940
Now these are two, as you see, there are two channels within us,

63
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,400
one looks after the right side and one looks after the left side.

64
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:38,190
Now if you have a problem in the left side

65
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:45,480
then problems psychosomatic can come in.

66
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,100
Supposing, your hand is broken or

67
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:55,850
is there some sort of a physical problem then it's all right.

68
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,690
But when it is the complicated psychosomatic trouble

69
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,190
then doctors cannot cure it, I am sorry to say.

70
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,980
Because you don't know the other side of side of it,

71
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:15,440
what is affecting the patient to get this cancer, you don't know.

72
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,350
You will be happy to know in Sahaja Yoga

73
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,400
cancer is curable,

74
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:28,270
curable if it is at a very early stage

75
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,060
it's very easy but otherwise also.

76
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,650
Specially blood cancer

77
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,270
is absolutely curable.

78
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,600
You will be amazed that it is

79
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:50,980
such a combination of these two sides of our life,

80
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:55,440
that we get into these diseases which are incurable.

81
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,730
There is a big list of these incurable diseases

82
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,560
which I don't want to tell you

83
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:02,850
which you know very well.

84
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,440
So in all of them there is a complication of the left side.

85
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,480
Of course you know about right side very much,

86
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,600
Gray's anatomy and after that all you know, but

87
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,810
you don't know how you get affected by the left side.

88
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,150
So in this lecture, I would like to tell you something about the left side,

89
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:34,650
which you have never heard of maybe, and you don't believe into.

90
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,020
The left side belongs to our past,

91
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:45,020
to our past in the sense that

92
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:51,850
those people who are futuristic do not get affected by left side,

93
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,890
but those people who live in the left side,

94
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,980
are worried about their left side,

95
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,890
are sorry for themselves, whatever it is,

96
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,100
they are the ones who get affected.

97
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,230
Left sided person if I tell you, you will be shocked to hear,

98
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,900
is actually possessed.

99
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:22,350
Possessed by some dead spirit which must be a knowledge to you.

100
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,480
You may not be believing in it but it is.

101
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:32,770
It can happen to anyone who gets

102
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:39,020
sad or gets into the left sided temperament,

103
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,480
Also there are so many other things like these false gurus,

104
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,400
what they do, they mesmerize,

105
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,520
mesmerize you with

106
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,980
dead  spirits which they have to control.

107
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,690
This side

108
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,730
of, I should say, not medicine non-medicine,

109
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,350
but whatever it is, should be known to the doctors;

110
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:08,690
otherwise you cannot do any curing.

111
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,850
You can, maybe, diagnosis you might do.

112
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,190
But you cannot cure people

113
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,690
who are suffering from psychosomatic troubles.

114
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,310
Today's medical problem is that

115
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,770
they cannot cure psychosomatic diseases.

116
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,940
For that you don't have to spend so many years,

117
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,480
as we do for MBBS.

118
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,480
It's a very, very short course, if you can do that.

119
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:43,940
Firstly, you should be connected to the divine force,

120
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:48,440
that's very important, that's not difficult at all,

121
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:55,690
but after that you have to maintain your spiritual abilities.

122
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,980
One of the spiritual ability is innocence,

123
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,270
the first chakra that you see

124
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,850
is innocence.

125
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,900
If you are a innocent person,

126
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:17,690
you can easily cure all such people who are suffering

127
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,890
from such incurable diseases.

128
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,900
I would say that one should first of all

129
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,100
try to get self realization, that's important.

130
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,810
When the Kundalini rises, She pierces through your fontanel bone area

131
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,310
and you are connected with the divine force which is all over.

132
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:47,560
You need not believe Me, but you get your selfrealization

133
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,730
If you have your self realization,

134
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,560
then you will be capable to understand

135
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:59,810
what sort of combination your patient has.

136
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,350
Is he only physically suffering

137
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,980
or he has this combination of left side?

138
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,690
The other day I was surprised, a child came to Me,

139
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:19,850
he was suffering from meningitis.

140
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,810
He got cured

141
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:29,150
and the parents didn't understand how did he get cured.

142
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,940
Then when the boy got cured I asked him:

143
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,810
"Who is your friend?"

144
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:41,520
He said, this particular boy, who has a particular guru.

145
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,020
All right.

146
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,770
And I go in his house

147
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,940
and go on watching that guru all the time, can you imagine?

148
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,190
There are many doctors also

149
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,520
who get involved with these bad gurus.

150
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,270
You must know, unless and until you are realized,

151
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:11,520
you will not know who is truthful and who is correct.

152
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,060
An innocent boy suffering from meningitis

153
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,600
and overnight he got cured.

154
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,480
You'll be amazed at

155
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,560
the great experience of Sahaja Yoga

156
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,350
and it is too great a surprise,

157
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,230
that's why people don't accept it.

158
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,190
But we have many cases by which we can show,

159
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,270
that people who were supposed to be incurable are cured.

160
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:54,850
So many people, especially with serious diseases, like cancer.

161
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,520
I mean in the medical science for cancer,

162
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,890
they will go on like this, like that,

163
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,150
till they shave you off completely.

164
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,890
But not in Sahaja Yoga,

165
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,150
immediately you will know that this man is possessed.

166
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,770
Now this line to Medical Science is absolutely not there,

167
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,810
but in our country we always believed in that.

168
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,480
We have certain rules and regulations

169
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,480
about people who are dead. How to behave?

170
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,440
How to go to Shamshan (MEANS Cremation ground)

171
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:34,650
and all that. There is a particular type of

172
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,100
understanding

173
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,730
of all these dead bodies,

174
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,060
how they behave, Where do they go?

175
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:48,850
And is I think a very big part

176
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:53,190
of your knowledge, very big part.

177
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,690
So many diseases, incurable, you cannot cure,

178
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,150
which are mostly coming from the left side.

179
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,850
Medical science can cure the right side.

180
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,600
I know that, that they can do it.

181
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:11,020
But cancer they will go on postponing from one to another,

182
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,150
they'll operate, then it will spread, this and that.

183
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,190
Operation is not the way to cure, it's not.

184
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:27,190
If you are expert  in Sahaja Yoga, you don't have to operate.

185
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,310
Overnight you can cure, overnight you can cure

186
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,560
cancer patient, believe Me.

187
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:37,560
You are quite capable of doing that. Especially Indians,

188
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,310
because Indians have a special capacity.

189
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,350
I should say what special blessing of this country.

190
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,400
We don't know this country how great it is,

191
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,060
but we are only dealing with the western education,

192
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,730
where have they reached, these western people in their experiments,

193
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,890
I just don't understand.

194
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,100
Their children are taking to drugs,

195
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,400
their families are disturbed,

196
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,230
everything is so upset.

197
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,650
Not that I decry this education, not at all.

198
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:19,890
But it is not complete

199
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,150
and you should have the other side of it.

200
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,350
Otherwise, don't have a cancer hospital.

201
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,940
Only have physical things

202
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,810
by which you will work it out

203
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,060
but if you want to have

204
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,400
patients of all types,

205
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:45,730
then you must know the other side.

206
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,440
There is nothing to be frightened, nothing to be upset,

207
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:54,230
but it's a knowledge which you should have as doctors,

208
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,150
because I think the medical science  is still not complete

209
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:03,350
that as Doctor Aggarwal himself has said it.

210
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,890
But what is lacking in it, the know- ledge of the left side that we have.

211
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,850
Now if I should say that

212
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,730
I didn't read it in any book,

213
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,980
I didn't get it from any book,

214
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,600
but only when I was

215
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:26,060
working with Sahaja Yoga, with people, I discovered

216
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,730
that compared to India, western people

217
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,350
are much more affected by the left side, much more.

218
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,940
much more. And they cannot understand

219
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,890
how they are sick, what has happened to them.

220
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:48,150
Even if you take a very limited area of treatment

221
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,350
of a human welfare

222
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:58,520
then is a very important part is the left side

223
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,230
Supposing a lady who is all the time crying

224
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,690
and weeping and unhappy,

225
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,890
she can get cancer.

226
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,310
Now there are two types,

227
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,940
one also right sided diseases,

228
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,520
one is of course the left side.

229
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,850
In the right sided people,

230
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,270
who are extremely, I should say, aggressive,

231
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:31,440
extremely overpowering, controlling type,

232
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,810
of course they have a very bad liver, I must say.

233
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,890
They have a very bad liver

234
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,270
and when they get like that they cross all the limits

235
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,060
and when they cross all the limits

236
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:53,480
they get such diseases which you cannot find out, you cannot cure.

237
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:58,190
One of them is the disease of the liver,

238
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,890
I think doctors can't cure liver. They may try,

239
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:08,190
but can't cure liver as Sahaja Yoga can cure.

240
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,690
And such a person  whose temperament, he's so hot tempered

241
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,480
and he's  so aggressive and this and that,

242
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:23,810
he suffers from that horrible liver

243
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:28,310
and develops all kinds of complications.

244
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,770
There are so many other diseases also

245
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,520
on the right side, so many other.

246
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:39,810
But mainly I think is a disease of the liver.

247
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,980
Liver is lived with.

248
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,600
And if your liver is out, there is no solution in the allopathy.

249
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,770
May be little bit here and little bit there.

250
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:56,600
But at the climax of it,

251
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:02,560
with the liver one can fade, one can even die.

252
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,020
In the West, liver problem is very common

253
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,060
and there is no solution for them for that.

254
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,810
They go on living with it

255
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,980
and doctors just admit them in the hospital.

256
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,230
These are not incurable, they are absolutely curable.

257
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,850
Because we haven't got that knowledge

258
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:39,770
and that's why we call them incurable. No, they're not.

259
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,060
I do not want to blame other diseases,

260
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:48,890
but there are so many of them, which cannot be even diagnosed

261
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,270
and which cannot be cured by the medical science.

262
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,690
Which we must accept first of all,

263
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,020
that that is the situation.

264
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:03,520
We may go on trying doing anything

265
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,650
but we cannot cure.

266
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,020
So many types of medicines will come out, we cannot cure.

267
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,650
Because what I am trying to tell you

268
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,310
that's only half part

269
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,270
of your being is discussed.

270
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,600
In that also so many things are not there.

271
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,650
Take it for example asthma,

272
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:31,310
asthma cannot be cured by doctors, is a fact

273
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,890
but Sahaja Yoga can absolutely cure

274
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,480
Allergies also can be cured by us.

275
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:44,270
Because if you have the roots of all the troubles,

276
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,890
if you know about the roots,

277
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,730
not pharmaceutical and all that but real roots,

278
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:55,190
then you  can handle the situation and you can cure.

279
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,560
We haven't got any yet a college or anything so far in Sahaja Yoga.

280
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:05,150
I wish we could. But hospital we have.

281
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,600
We have a hospital in Belapur, they call it

282
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:15,520
New Bombay, where they are treating people.

283
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:18,480
Only they have to pay for their stay

284
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,690
and it's hardly I think 300 rupees per day

285
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:28,900
for poor people. But you don't need any medicine,

286
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,850
you don't have to pay for anything.

287
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,890
For our country which is so poor,

288
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,690
don't you think, it's very important?

289
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,270
Otherwise you go for X-ray,

290
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,890
then you go for another test,

291
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,100
then for another test and nothing comes out of it.

292
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:57,190
One should only know how to deal with it.

293
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,400
Now supposing somebody's leg is broken - finished,

294
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:09,100
cut his leg, put another leg. No need,

295
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:12,850
I assure you there is no need.

296
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:18,440
Now we have some doctors in Sahaja Yoga, very good.

297
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,230
Some of them are in America, some of them are in Italy

298
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,730
and some of them are in Russia.

299
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,890
Russian doctors are very good.

300
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,440
I don't know how they think

301
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,850
that there is something beyond this education

302
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,730
and they are trying to learn it.

303
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,730
If you can make any facility,

304
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,150
I will be very happy but in any case

305
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,350
I am thinking of starting

306
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,810
a Sahaja Yoga hospital in your country

307
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,480
specially in Delhi,

308
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,350
in Greater Noida

309
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,810
and if some of your doctors can join us

310
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,520
help us a lot.

311
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,150
In Greater Noida I am thinking of starting

312
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,560
a college or we can call it a school

313
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:15,980
we'll get the students as well as doctors

314
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,890
who can cure people. And there will be...

315
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:24,690
And there will be no charges for treatment.

316
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:28,400
Of course, where they stay, if they come and stay there

317
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,770
then they might have to pay for  their food, that's all.

318
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,850
Otherwise this is an arrangement I am having

319
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,770
and anybody who wants to join as a doctor, also

320
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,730
we'll like to accept their services.

321
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:48,020
How much will be the pay I don't now, but not much I would say,

322
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:52,890
we'll pay about 6000 to 7000 per month to a doctor.

323
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,980
But he has to be a Sahaja yogi

324
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,600
and he should know the method of Sahaja Yoga.

325
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,900
I think, it is one of

326
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,060
the very generous feeling

327
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,770
that in our country so many die

328
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:14,400
because they cannot get into the hospital, they cannot get treated.

329
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:21,560
If you can give some time to this project of Mine,

330
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:27,520
I am sure I'll be able to organize a good hospital

331
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:31,060
for those people. In that we'll have

332
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:35,020
somatic patients as well as psychosomatic patients

333
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,810
all kinds of patients we'll have.

334
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,730
And you will learn so much

335
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:45,150
because it's a very subtle and deep knowledge.

336
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:50,890
Just cannot learn it on the book, you have to have experiment

337
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:54,270
with the patient. You will be amazed,

338
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,690
how you will be curing people.

339
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:01,520
It´s not book of knowledge, it's a very, very practical knowledge

340
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:07,810
and those who have that charitable temperament

341
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,150
can do very well and learn a lot.

342
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,890
One thing I must tell you

343
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,600
Sahaja Yoga has one bad point also,

344
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,150
that you cannot make money, you cannot.

345
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,190
If you try making money out of it, you fail.

346
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,980
Some or other this money business is little higher

347
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:34,730
for Sahaja Yogis, they cannot manage with it.

348
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,100
But you can give service.

349
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:45,600
Now we had a very nice retired doctor in this Belapur hospital

350
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,060
and he did very well,

351
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:51,270
now he is no more. He worked very hard

352
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,270
but his daughter in law is now looking after that.

353
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,770
If you want, if you are retired people,

354
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,270
if you are not in need of money

355
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,770
much money then it's a very good thing.

356
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,100
Also we provide, say, a residence,

357
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:18,270
food, everything, can be managed, it's not so difficult,

358
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,350
but it's not a very money oriented

359
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:26,350
I must say since I was studying medical,

360
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,520
now medical line has become very money oriented,

361
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,150
I am surprised. I am sorry to say,

362
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,480
but they have become very money oriented

363
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,190
and some of your doctors have gone to America

364
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,060
and have befooled people so much

365
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:46,600
and have made so much money that you feel ashamed to be an Indian,

366
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:47,650
it's like that.

367
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,480
You can't make much money

368
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,980
but as retired people you can join us and help us

369
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:57,230
and some of you can come to learn Sahaja Yoga.

370
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,350
Hardly within say months time you will be experts.

371
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,730
You can diagnose the thing without any delay.

372
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,100
You don't have to go to any laboratory or anything,

373
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,440
immediately you will know what's the trouble.

374
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:17,100
And all sorts of incurable diseases you can try.

375
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:23,270
I am amazed Myself as to how it is working with people.

376
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,940
Now all these awards and all that they have given Me

377
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:30,060
because I have cured people and done that

378
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:32,810
but I don't have a hospital there.

379
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,940
First hospital I want to have in Delhi and here I want to work it out.

380
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:42,810
Let us think of working it out ourselves.

381
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:48,520
It's a charitable hospital and it's very sensible,

382
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,520
I have already got money to build,

383
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,480
but only thing I need some doctors who can help Me,

384
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,770
it´s a very stunning thing Sahaja Yoga,

385
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,730
if you come you will be amazed how it works.

386
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,310
I know

387
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,100
never been that, we have never been connected to the divine.

388
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,190
We have never used that forces of the divine

389
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:16,060
and once you start using those forces you will be amazed at yourself.

390
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:20,850
It is said that you should find out who you are,

391
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:27,440
that's not possible unless and until you have your selfrealization.

392
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:31,190
Today in our country we need self realized people

393
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,850
all kinds of problems can be solved.

394
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,890
Every type of,

395
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:41,730
I should say, quarrelling is going on.

396
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,560
Because you become a collective person,

397
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,310
you become a personality of a collective nature,

398
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,980
no more fighting no more is needed. I have many

399
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,560
Muslim countries who have got realization,

400
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:04,520
Turkey, this Benin, there is another one called as Ivory Coast.

401
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,440
There are seven countries that side,

402
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:10,270
they are all Muslims converted,

403
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,150
or rather transformed into Sahaja Yoga.

404
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,310
In this all the integration of all the religions take place,

405
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,480
understanding of the

406
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:26,060
human abilities,

407
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,890
human personality and respect.

408
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,600
I mean it's a very different atmosphere into which you get,

409
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:39,400
it's a very different level of awareness, as you were saying,

410
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:44,690
where you become so peaceful, silent,

411
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,310
yet so sweet.

412
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,600
So I don't know in this short lecture

413
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,020
how much can I tell you about Sahaja Yoga

414
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,560
bur it is a very miraculous thing.

415
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:00,150
And please try to get your self realization,

416
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:06,920
he has Me, I think, I will try if I can do that.
