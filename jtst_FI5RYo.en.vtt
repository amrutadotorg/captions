00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:45.410
Is very difficult to speak, even for Me

00:33:53.810 --> 00:34:00.890
to see so many Sahaja yogis

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:11.290
sitting here with such shining faces

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:14.810
from all over the world,

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:24.450
as if My vision has taken its form today.

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:40.170
I see in you the saviors of tomorrow

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:44.330
who are going to save this world

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:49.570
from all the Kali Yuga calamities

00:34:49.810 --> 00:34:53.170
that are surrounding us.

00:34:54.130 --> 00:34:57.890
Is coming from all sides,

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:06.290
while you people have really taken your second birth

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:10.770
from this pond of Kali Yuga

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:16.450
and have really become beautiful lotuses of different colors,

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:21.250
hues, fragrance and beauty.

00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:26.450
Instead of you celebrating My birthday,

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:31.490
is better I celebrate your birthdays.

00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.290
As I told you the other day that

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:49.130
it is you who are such great seekers, seekers of truth, of love,

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:51.930
that it could work out,

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:57.570
otherwise it would have been impossible.

00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:02.050
To even transform one person is very difficult,

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:06.570
but you were so sensitive

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:11.930
and so deep that this subtle knowledge,

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:17.690
I don't know how it penetrated your being.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:20.250
It's unbelievable.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:24.130
I can't believe Myself

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:32.170
what great people have taken birth in this Kali Yuga.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:36.290
No one can believe that there are so many

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:38.810
saints are sitting before Me, so many Walis;

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:42.530
so many Nalis are sitting before Me.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:51.130
In the history of spirituality it has never happened.

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:56.090
Even in the heavens there are few devatas

00:36:56.090 --> 00:36:59.410
and devas, not so many.

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:03.370
One better than the other

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:09.850
such beautiful heart,

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:15.850
such brilliant brains

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:28.690
and such active attention, is really

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:35.410
I thank you all that this seventieth birthday I could see

00:37:35.410 --> 00:37:40.010
so many people, which I never expected.

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:44.850
You know, Sahaja Yoga was started with one person

00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:49.010
and then those who came also,

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:54.850
out of them, some were power-oriented, money-oriented,

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:59.250
all kinds of people created problems for us.

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:02.810
One after another, so many problems came

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:06.130
and also there were many who were

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:10.690
of a very low-level seekers.

00:38:10.690 --> 00:38:17.050
But I find today they have all come up beautifully.

00:38:17.730 --> 00:38:22.970
I cannot distinguish one from another,

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:25.690
the way it has happened.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:29.170
And the commitment you have to Sahaja Yoga

00:38:29.170 --> 00:38:35.410
is the greatest blessings for this world.

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:41.050
I could not do it alone. You know that.

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:46.290
If I could do it, I would not have needed you.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:49.250
You are the channels

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:55.810
and you have to work it out further and further.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:03.250
It is really remarkable the way

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:07.570
Delhi people have organized everything.

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:24.210
First of all, everybody was very much

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:27.050
keyed onto the seventieth birthday.

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:32.370
I don't know what was the reason, but whatever it is,

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:33.730
and then Delhi people said,

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:35.730
"This time we are going to celebrate,

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.690
Mother, Your birthday in Delhi."

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:43.810
I said, "Everybody's ... on it, so be careful,

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:47.850
it's not going to be easy. It's a big headache.

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:52.170
So many will be coming down."

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:55.770
But they didn't expect so much, I'm sure

00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:59.970
... people are coming. Hundred are coming from there,

00:39:59.970 --> 00:40:04.170
hundred from there. I said, "Are you worried?"

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:07.490
They said, "No we are very happy about it."

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:12.010
I saw their enthusiasm, their organization,

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:14.690
the way they have done it.

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:16.610
The best part of it,

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:21.970
Delhi, which is a place where all kinds of politicians live,

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:25.170
have groups and politics and all that,

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:30.450
but in Sahaja Yoga in Delhi there is no politics.

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:43.290
There is no quarrelling.

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:46.210
There is no pulling each other's legs.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:49.050
Is very remarkable thing

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:52.170
it to happen in a place like Delhi,

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:54.290
where every day what you hear

00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:59.610
that even in our parliament they are beating each other.

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.450
Perhaps, in this hell only,

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:07.330
this goodness was to be born and

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:10.410
to be manifested by Sahaja yogis.

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:13.130
The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:18.250
as you know, is extremely, extremely subtle

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:22.890
and it's not easy

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:30.410
to penetrate into the so-called

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:33.890
people who call themselves intellectuals

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:42.010
or who are absolutely bowed down to their conditionings.

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:47.090
So, on one side, we have the masses who are ignorant,

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:51.890
another side the classes who live in the frame

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:55.530
that they have made out of their brains.

00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:01.530
Both ways, I think, they are extremely gross.

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:07.930
But the way they have absorbed

00:42:07.930 --> 00:42:17.130
this subtle nectar of Divinity is something unbelievable.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:23.890
Nobody can comprehend even

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:36.530
that there were so many born after My birth,

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:40.010
on this Earth,

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:44.970
or some maybe before also, very few.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:48.770
Just after My birth they were born here

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:56.130
in this world, to get to Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:56.010 --> 00:43:01.530
But when I saw the world I was shocked,

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:04.090
more shocked than Kabira, himself.

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:08.890
I said, "How will I talk to anyone about it?"

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:11.050
My family members,

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:15.530
I didn't know how will I open the subject to them.

00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:23.770
Was impossible, so much was darkness of ignorance.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:31.370
How will they believe that there is really Divinity,

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:36.490
there is totality waiting for them?

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:40.610
They all believed into some sort of a religion,

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:43.930
which had no connection with reality.

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:50.850
And it was impossible even to envisage

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:54.970
the method by which I could talk to them.

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:58.090
I remember the first incident

00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:05.490
when we went to Nargol, where I had opened the Sahasrara.

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:11.810
The first person who got realization was a Gujarati and a jeweler.

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:15.610
Immediately, all the other,

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:19.130
there were hardly about thirty-five people

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:20.690
they started saying that

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:23.490
"Of course, he's a rich man, he's a jeweler,

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:26.290
so Mother has given him realization."

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:30.330
I think that's the first time and last time I really got angry.

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:34.250
I started shouting at them,

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:36.250
"You are good for nothing, useless people,

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:39.130
you can never take to Divinity,"

00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:41.890
and I had really thought that "Stop it now."

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:44.410
One has to take another life,

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:50.130
another time where people will understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:55.170
But after that, suddenly,

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:58.450
people started feeling the cool breeze in their hands,

00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:03.330
immediately, after My shouting. Imagine.

00:45:03.330 --> 00:45:09.850
And they said, "Mother, You know, it's working.

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:12.730
It's working in us. It's working out of us."

00:45:12.730 --> 00:45:17.450
Thus, we got twelve people

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:24.610
and one lady whom I had given before also,

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:28.770
she was the fourteenth.

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:36.650
Thus, first we had only these fourteen Sahaja yogis,

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:43.530
for whom it was something out of the blue.

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:46.130
They were all flabbergasted.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:48.890
They didn't know what it was.

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:56.330
And then, surprisingly, in one of our programs,

00:45:56.330 --> 00:46:04.850
a lady who was possessed by some Brahmin came

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:10.570
and started saying, "Jagadamba, Jagadamba."

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:15.010
They couldn't understand. I never told them what I was, never.

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:17.290
I've never told otherwise also.

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:22.610
So then, she recited a poem

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:25.490
from Saundarya Lahari in Sanskrit language

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:27.890
and she was just a maidservant.

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:31.130
And in a man's voice.

00:46:33.330 --> 00:46:35.130
So everybody was shocked

00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:38.890
that the bhoots should say all these things.

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:41.450
And then she went away.

00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:46.730
After that, these people started probing into it.

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:51.890
And they wanted to have My Puja, first time,

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:55.050
in My house itself.

00:46:55.330 --> 00:47:03.570
Still people were not very sure they were doing the right thing.

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:05.450
Even the Brahmins they called, they said,

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:08.810
"This Saptasadi is a very difficult Puja

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:12.450
and something will happen to us."

00:47:12.450 --> 00:47:14.050
But after the Puja they said,

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:18.130
"Nothing happened, we are so much better."

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:22.610
They all felt the cool breeze

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:26.410
and the entire atmosphere changed.

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:29.610
They started understanding that

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:35.290
Sahaja Yoga is the Yuga Dharma, is the one

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:43.490
of this yuga, this Kali Yuga,

00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:51.370
so the Sahaj Dharma became the dharma of this yuga.

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:57.450
This yuga is very difficult, no doubt.

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:04.690
But in difficulties only we become intense seekers

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:10.610
and that's what happened with all of you,

00:48:10.610 --> 00:48:17.450
that you found out that everywhere

00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:20.730
people were following whatever they're following,

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:24.570
they were not reaching any point.

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:27.450
Like a cocoon,

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:31.290
they're hitting their head here and there.

00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:34.570
They got their realizations

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:38.850
so quickly and when they told Me

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:44.170
how they were seeking, what was happening to them,

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:48.250
I was amazed.

00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:53.610
How this seeking was working within them

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:56.570
and pushed them towards Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:58.770
Also, in the meanwhile, I must say,

00:48:58.770 --> 00:49:07.410
so many got lost into the clutches of false gurus.

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:13.610
Despite that, today we have so many Sahaja yogis.

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:16.410
You are just representing your country,

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:20.330
but there are many more in your countries.

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:23.050
Even in India we have many more.

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:27.730
You are just here, come to represent them.

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:30.810
So, multiple of this number,

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:33.290
I do not know how many would be there.

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:35.810
So many asked "Me how many Sahaja yogis there are". I said,

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:37.690
"I don't know."

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:38.810
Say, "You don't know?"

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:43.570
I said, "No. We have never kept any record."

00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:46.050
So they can't understand. I said,

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:53.210
"We have no office, no record. I have no secretary.

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:56.210
I don't know how to type.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:59.930
I don't know how to write even My check."

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:02.890
They can't understand

00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:07.010
person like Me existing in these modern times.

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:12.130
But everything gets done, somehow.

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:17.090
Despite all My modern ignorance,

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:21.570
everything gets absolutely

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:24.290
done in the most perfect manner

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:28.410
like a remote control.

00:50:28.410 --> 00:50:31.490
Now this whole thing,

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:38.130
I never said a word about it, I must tell you, nothing.

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:43.930
Never I gave any idea as to how it should be.

00:50:43.930 --> 00:50:48.610
I didn't even tell them how many we are expecting.

00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:54.770
But see how spontaneously everything has worked out

00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:58.690
because you all have commitment

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:02.330
and that commitment gives you

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:06.730
all these organizing capacities.

00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:15.810
So many things you have seen get organized

00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:19.690
because also this Paramchaitanya

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:24.010
has come into Krita Yuga

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:28.250
where it is working it out. It's acting.

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:33.890
And this activity, also, is absolutely supportive to you.

00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:38.770
For example, the police people told us

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:41.050
that there are Muslims living here

00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:43.730
and you might have some danger from them.

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:46.210
They might do some harm to you.

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:48.370
I said, "Which Muslims are they?"

00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:53.010
So they said, "Nizamuddin Aulia's people are here."

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.890
I said, "They'll never harm us."

00:51:56.890 --> 00:52:01.010
I said, "Why? Because he was a Sufi

00:52:01.010 --> 00:52:04.770
and he was a great realized soul

00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:10.050
and the people who are along there, must be, most of them are,

00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:14.450
at least, believers of Sufism.

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:17.610
How can they harm us?"

00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:19.770
So I said, "Tomorrow, early in the morning,

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:26.170
you go and put a chador, as they call it, all of you,"

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:27.570
and they were so impressed

00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:32.690
that you saw in the evening they came here all the way,

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:36.370
morning time, and they were so respectful.

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:38.530
Then they called Me, they gave Me another chador,

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:42.970
this, that and they said that we are Yours and this and that,

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:44.770
all kinds of things.

00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:46.810
And his disciple was Amir Khusrau,

00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:50.370
was another very, very great Sufi gentleman

00:52:50.370 --> 00:52:54.090
and I always have admired his poetry

00:52:54.090 --> 00:53:00.530
and also the way Nizamuddin led his life of dignity

00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:04.730
and divinity.

00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:07.450
All these Muslims who were there put hands towards Me like this

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:10.530
and they said, "We are feeling the cool breeze,"

00:53:10.530 --> 00:53:12.770
I said, "This is Ruh."

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:15.530
"Ah, this is Ruh."

00:53:16.850 --> 00:53:19.530
Once these people start getting Ruh,

00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:22.050
they will all become Sahaja yogis very soon

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:25.530
and you may have to have ...

00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:40.690
There are so many Sufis all over the world

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:42.770
and we are going to take their addresses

00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:44.210
and we are going to meet them;

00:53:44.210 --> 00:53:46.930
then you might have to have another big pendal,

00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:50.730
double pendal I think, maybe triple.

00:53:57.010 --> 00:54:04.890
If Delhi people are not quite frightened about the sizes,

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:09.330
I think again we'll have to have it in Delhi only.

00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:28.490
Also contemporarily,

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:32.770
Delhi is in a state of turmoil

00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:37.570
and we should be here to pacify it, to quieten it,

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:40.890
to give wisdom to those people

00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:44.690
who are supposed to be at the helm of affairs.

00:54:45.130 --> 00:54:49.170
It will work. Definitely, it will work.

00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:51.570
With all these Sahaja yogis

00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:53.930
emitting such beautiful, vibrations.

00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:55.410
See, on top of your head

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:59.050
this cloth is moving up and down all the time,

00:54:59.290 --> 00:55:02.010
though there is no breeze outside,

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:04.170
the leaves are just steady,

00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:08.650
but from your head, you see, you are moving all this.

00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:14.610
So I'm sure these vibrations

00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:19.370
will cool down and will bring peace

00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:24.130
to our politicians and to the people

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:28.530
who are at the helm of affairs.

00:55:28.530 --> 00:55:32.810
At this juncture, when in the whole world

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:37.290
there are so many things going on

00:55:37.290 --> 00:55:40.250
of uncertainties,

00:55:40.650 --> 00:55:43.730
say in Russia, there are uncertainties,

00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:46.890
Bosnia there is uncertainties,

00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:49.890
in England there's recession,

00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:52.050
America there is recession,

00:55:52.330 --> 00:55:54.130
Spain there is recession,

00:55:54.130 --> 00:55:56.930
everybody is suffering from the pangs

00:55:57.210 --> 00:56:02.970
of some sort of a extreme behavior they went into.

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:06.050
So, I'm sure this polarity

00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:09.250
that they see now will correct

00:56:09.610 --> 00:56:13.450
their behavior towards materialism

00:56:13.450 --> 00:56:19.130
and I'm sure that a balance will be struck.

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:23.050
With your good wishes, with your prayers,

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:30.130
this world will be so beautiful,

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:39.090
so enchanting that in the history,

00:56:39.090 --> 00:56:41.410
people will describe

00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:45.050
that the world itself became a lotus

00:56:45.050 --> 00:56:50.410
full of fragrance of Divinity.

00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:01.170
You are the petals,

00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:04.890
you are the corona,

00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:09.890
you are the color,

00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:13.450
you are the beauty,

00:57:15.010 --> 00:57:16.930
you are the pollen

00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:21.610
of that beautiful lotus

00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:28.330
which is My vision of this world.

00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:31.170
I hope today

00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:37.690
you all will decide to work for Sahaja Yoga,

00:57:37.690 --> 00:57:39.130
to spread Sahaja Yoga

00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:42.930
and work for yourself also.

00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:45.090
The only danger is

00:57:45.090 --> 00:57:50.130
that one should not allow ego to sit on your heads.

00:57:50.370 --> 00:57:55.170
That's the only horse.

00:57:55.170 --> 00:57:59.970
If you could ride yourself and don't allow the horse to ride you,

00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:02.250
you'll progress very fast,

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:05.450
beautifully.

00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:16.490
Thus, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread.

00:58:16.490 --> 00:58:25.050
Every birthday we have to take a vow.

00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:30.490
I don't know what vow I should take.

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:36.290
People have told Me that I should not work so hard,

00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:38.170
I'm working very hard,

00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:42.530
but I have taken a vow that I'll work double hard.

00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:52.530
In the same way, you also,

00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:55.410
all of you, have to take a vow today

00:58:55.410 --> 00:59:00.250
that we'll go all out in the commitment

00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:03.490
of working of Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:06.370
We'll think about it.

00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:09.210
There are scientists who should produce books,

00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:11.890
there are doctors who should produce books,

00:59:11.890 --> 00:59:13.370
writings,

00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:14.690
go round,

00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:16.610
talk to their colleagues,

00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:20.570
organize meetings,

00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:24.090
seminars with your colleagues.

00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:29.370
There are architects

00:59:30.330 --> 00:59:34.890
and other professionals

00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:40.810
who could call their colleagues and give them realization.

00:59:40.810 --> 00:59:43.530
Even the people who are dealing with finances

00:59:43.530 --> 00:59:46.050
should take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:49.650
Is very important because

00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:53.890
financial problems can only be

00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:56.770
solved by the Divine Power.

00:59:56.770 --> 01:00:00.330
Nobody else can solve it.

01:00:00.730 --> 01:00:04.490
So everyone in this world,

01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:09.930
whether it is law or any other field,

01:00:09.930 --> 01:00:15.170
all of you should take to Sahaja Yoga

01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:20.690
and also to creative work.

01:00:21.610 --> 01:00:26.010
Then also, you have to take Sahaja Yoga

01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:28.490
to your surroundings,

01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:35.010
to villages, to cities,

01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:38.050
wherever it is possible,

01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:40.450
wherever you can organize,

01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:44.330
you have to spread Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:47.050
As far as curing is concerned,

01:00:47.050 --> 01:00:50.410
I would advise, you don't have to touch anyone.

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:53.210
Please use only My photograph.

01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:56.050
That's how you'll get more Sahaja yogis

01:00:56.050 --> 01:01:00.490
and less sick people.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:03.010
Also, people will be cured

01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:06.770
and all of them will become Sahaja yogis.

01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:10.370
We have also agricultural field

01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:12.810
on which we have done something,

01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:18.210
but much can be done about agriculture.

01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:20.890
One should see the government and tell them

01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:23.290
what agriculture can do.

01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:26.370
You can form a committee and go and see them

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:30.490
and talk to them that

01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:36.410
how agriculture can be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:39.050
We have to help our children.

01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:41.410
We have to look after them

01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:50.610
because you know what sort of future is surrounding them,

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:53.810
what sort of atmosphere is crawling,

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:57.250
even in India.

01:01:57.250 --> 01:02:01.050
So we have to see that our children

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:04.290
properly grow in Sahaj culture.

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:07.570
Is very important

01:02:07.570 --> 01:02:11.410
because they are tomorrow's Sahaja yogis.

01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:14.250
So many of them are born realized,

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:16.930
so we have to discipline them properly

01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:22.570
and we have to make them aala, "aala darza"

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:27.130
Sahaja yogi, as described in the qawali.

01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:38.570
It is also our family life which is very important.

01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:40.610
Is shocking that

01:02:40.610 --> 01:02:44.170
family life is nowadays becoming

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:48.090
a kind of a stupid thing.

01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:51.290
No one understands the importance of it.

01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:54.850
In Sahaja Yoga we have to understand.

01:02:54.850 --> 01:02:59.570
Small quarrels, fights, should be given up.

01:02:59.570 --> 01:03:04.930
Harshness must be given up, cruelty must be given up

01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:10.810
and there should be a proper rapport

01:03:10.810 --> 01:03:18.370
between husband and wife to begin with,

01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:22.010
so that there is a companionship

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:25.330
and the children also see that companionship

01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:29.250
and enjoy it.

01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:33.850
In our dress, in our life,

01:03:33.850 --> 01:03:38.730
we have to be dignified and decent, respecting our body.

01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:41.210
Is very important.

01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:43.690
We should wear whatever suits us

01:03:43.690 --> 01:03:46.450
in whatever country we are.

01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:49.490
I mean, imagine in summer climate

01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:52.250
if somebody wants to wear a three-piece suit,

01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:54.690
what will happen to him?

01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:56.970
Whatever suits us,

01:03:56.970 --> 01:04:01.290
whatever fits our culture,

01:04:01.290 --> 01:04:05.850
one should try to wear decent dresses,

01:04:05.850 --> 01:04:08.570
traditional dresses.

01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:11.370
Specially for women, it is very important

01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:16.210
to wear dresses that will make them look more dignified.

01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:26.490
Also, another point I would like to say,

01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:31.370
that ladies, specially, must take to reading,

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:34.890
at least newspapers.

01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:39.050
If your attention is on the problems

01:04:39.050 --> 01:04:42.650
that are in this world, it's very effective

01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:47.490
because you know your attention is active, it works.

01:04:49.290 --> 01:04:51.810
So use your attention.

01:04:51.810 --> 01:04:53.290
You see the newspapers,

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:55.930
you watch -- I know it's horrifying sometimes

01:04:55.930 --> 01:04:57.730
you can give a bandhan,

01:04:57.730 --> 01:05:01.090
but you must see what's happening where,

01:05:01.090 --> 01:05:03.890
is very important.

01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:08.810
Also men should not just read something sensational,

01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:11.970
but read something that's happening

01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:15.370
and also think, what are the solutions.

01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:18.770
How can you people, as Sahaja yogis, help it,

01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:22.050
in a collective way or in an individual way.

01:05:22.050 --> 01:05:29.850
We have to solve many problems of this modern world.

01:05:29.850 --> 01:05:32.930
Also one has to read good books,

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:35.970
good films one has to see,

01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:38.690
and have your reflection on them.

01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:40.650
Keep your mind alert.

01:05:40.650 --> 01:05:44.890
There are many beautiful poems I've read recently

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:46.370
coming out of

01:05:46.370 --> 01:05:49.290
some people where I never expected they will write poems,

01:05:49.290 --> 01:05:51.850
beautiful, very high class.

01:05:52.050 --> 01:05:55.330
So this poetry also, we are going to collect.

01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:58.450
We are going to collect all the miraculous photographs

01:05:58.450 --> 01:05:59.970
from everywhere.

01:05:59.970 --> 01:06:03.370
They are trying to systematize now.

01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:05.330
And now, in this system,

01:06:05.330 --> 01:06:07.970
if you can all help spontaneously,

01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:12.410
it will be a great achievement

01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:15.930
because, so far, we have not been able to collect

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:20.130
all these datas and keep them with us.

01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:25.170
Now the best is that you all must meditate.

01:06:25.170 --> 01:06:27.890
All have to meditate.

01:06:27.890 --> 01:06:30.650
Only in meditation you are in present

01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:33.450
and you grow in your spirituality.

01:06:33.450 --> 01:06:37.450
I've said it many a times, but people just don't do it.

01:06:37.450 --> 01:06:41.010
About ten minutes, if you can meditate

01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:44.610
before sleeping, it's of a very great help to you,

01:06:45.810 --> 01:06:47.490
no doubt.

01:06:47.850 --> 01:06:49.570
We really grow very fast.

01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:52.370
Immediately I know this man is meditating,

01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:54.530
the way he has changed.

01:06:54.530 --> 01:06:56.330
And then, once you get used to it,

01:06:56.570 --> 01:06:59.050
you'll never give it up.

01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:01.010
Is very simple meditation.

01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:03.770
You have foot soaking or something like that

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:06.890
and in the morning you should beat your ego,

01:07:06.890 --> 01:07:08.570
that's all.

01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:11.610
Is not that you have to do

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:15.050
one lakh jappas or something.

01:07:15.050 --> 01:07:16.530
Nothing of the kind.

01:07:16.530 --> 01:07:18.250
Is very simple.

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:20.450
But this, you have to do for yourself,

01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:26.770
to respect your Self-realization and your growth in divinity.

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:36.010
We have lots of advantages over others.

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:38.290
But one thing I have to tell you,

01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:43.490
those people who are not prone to seeking,

01:07:43.490 --> 01:07:47.050
please don't talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:50.050
Don't waste your energy on such people,

01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:52.050
discussing and arguing,

01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:54.810
because it cannot be discussed much.

01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:57.490
You just forget them and leave them alone.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:59.090
I'll look after them.

01:07:59.090 --> 01:08:02.890
You just take to simple people, good people,

01:08:02.890 --> 01:08:06.970
who are seeking the truth.

01:08:06.970 --> 01:08:09.530
I don't want you to break your necks with those people

01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:13.290
who are just believing in discussion,

01:08:13.210 --> 01:08:16.650
arguments and shabda jaal.

01:08:16.650 --> 01:08:20.970
Today the Sahaja Yoga culture is so much manifesting

01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:24.090
that people, once they see you, they immediately know

01:08:24.090 --> 01:08:26.610
there's something special

01:08:26.850 --> 01:08:31.650
and that they have something very unique

01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:37.450
qualities among them which you seldom find with normal people.

01:08:37.450 --> 01:08:40.010
All these things, you should understand,

01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:43.130
have come to you spontaneously from within,

01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:46.690
but you must preserve them and you should never feel shy of them.

01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:50.170
Should never be shy of your virtues.

01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:53.330
And whatever people may try

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:55.730
to tell you that "You better do this and better do that"

01:08:55.730 --> 01:08:57.690
if it is wrong you should never do it.

01:08:56.370 --> 01:09:02.530
Because, now, you are very powerful

01:08:57.690 --> 01:09:00.290
Should just say, "I don't want to do it."

01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:09.730
and that you have to lead the people

01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:11.410
and people don't have to lead you.

01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:13.370
Fashions don't have to lead you,

01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:15.850
but you have to create fashions.

01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:19.570
You have to create a path for them.

01:09:19.570 --> 01:09:22.450
It's not that you have to

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:26.410
trod on the path that they have made.

01:09:26.410 --> 01:09:27.850
Try to understand

01:09:27.850 --> 01:09:31.210
that your own personality

01:09:31.210 --> 01:09:36.410
is of a level where you can see so many subtle things

01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:40.050
and you are so powerful, that others don't see,

01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:45.290
then you have to automatically take up their leadership.

01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:47.370
Don't get ideas from them

01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:49.010
and don't get frightened

01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:51.490
when they try to tell you something

01:09:51.490 --> 01:09:54.410
against yourself or against Sahaja Yoga.

01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:59.530
Be sure. Be confident. That is how it is going to work out.

01:09:59.530 --> 01:10:02.450
Now, I'm just a woman and a housewife,

01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:05.850
but I was so sure about Sahaja Yoga

01:10:05.850 --> 01:10:08.850
that it worked out.

01:10:10.730 --> 01:10:12.210
I didn't have to,

01:10:12.210 --> 01:10:16.410
sort of, think whether I should do it or not.

01:10:16.410 --> 01:10:21.050
I just started it.

01:10:21.490 --> 01:10:24.210
Though in the family it was not so much respected,

01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:28.130
not so much agreed to, doesn't matter.

01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:31.170
I started the whole thing on My own,

01:10:31.170 --> 01:10:33.010
worked it out on My own,

01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:36.330
because I had complete confidence in the truth,

01:10:36.330 --> 01:10:39.650
that if I am standing on the truth it will help Me

01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:42.730
and it will help all those who will come to Me.

01:10:42.730 --> 01:10:44.810
It has happened.

01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:47.770
So for you, it should not be difficult at all.

01:10:47.770 --> 01:10:49.570
All of you should, first of all,

01:10:49.570 --> 01:10:51.890
see that you are not a conditioned person

01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:54.170
and you do not have an ego

01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:57.050
and then you should go ahead with it

01:10:57.050 --> 01:11:00.410
and you'll be amazed how things will work out.

01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:04.170
Today's puja is very short puja.

01:11:04.450 --> 01:11:08.650
That's why I gave you a long lecture.

01:11:09.010 --> 01:11:12.290
There are so many things which I cannot,

01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:18.050
at this time, which is short, tell you

01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:21.010
but if you sit down, you can easily make

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:25.130
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight yourself.

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:28.490
So, now put your mind to it

01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:33.010
in a way that you are the organizer.

01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:35.770
Then what should you do? What can you do?

01:11:35.770 --> 01:11:37.050
What are you going to achieve?

01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:41.690
Please try and it will work out.

01:11:42.370 --> 01:11:44.170
All of you can do it.

01:11:44.170 --> 01:11:47.210
I think best is to make a diary for yourself

01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:50.250
and write it down in that: what you have done,

01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:52.330
how many people you have given realization,

01:11:52.330 --> 01:11:56.970
how many got cured, what do you think about them.

01:11:56.970 --> 01:11:59.530
But now, if there's no diary,

01:11:59.530 --> 01:12:00.850
Sahaja yogis can say among,

01:12:00.850 --> 01:12:03.930
"Mother, we have no diary, so we'll start it tomorrow." No,

01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:06.970
you start it today.

01:12:08.690 --> 01:12:11.330
Only trouble with Sahaja yogis

01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:15.250
is that they take things little lightly.

01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:22.650
Of course, that is their character.

01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:26.210
But not Sahaja Yoga.

01:12:26.210 --> 01:12:28.490
Other things you can take lightly.

01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:30.250
If somebody shouts at you,

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:31.730
somebody gets angry with you,

01:12:31.730 --> 01:12:34.290
somebody even slaps you, take it lightly.

01:12:34.290 --> 01:12:37.250
Doesn't matter, makes no difference to you,

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:39.210
because you are the spirit.

01:12:39.210 --> 01:12:40.810
Nothing can destroy the spirit.

01:12:40.810 --> 01:12:43.690
Nainam Chidanti Shastrani.

01:12:45.490 --> 01:12:48.050
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga,

01:12:48.050 --> 01:12:50.330
your attitude should be different.

01:12:50.330 --> 01:12:52.530
If you are relaxing on one side,

01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:55.890
another side you have to be dynamic

01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:58.770
and that side is where you have to put forward

01:12:58.770 --> 01:13:00.330
the theories of Sahaja Yoga,

01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:02.090
when you have to talk to people,

01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:04.370
you have to organize a press conference

01:13:04.370 --> 01:13:06.490
or whatever sort of thing you want to do.

01:13:06.490 --> 01:13:08.490
At whatever level you want to work it out,

01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:10.930
please make a proper plan about it

01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:13.050
and just do it.

01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:17.410
It will all work out. I'm sure it will work out.

01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:23.090
With all these ideas that I have,

01:13:24.210 --> 01:13:27.210
you have many more

01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:31.170
and I hope by next year,

01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:33.890
we'll see manifestation of those.

01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:36.050
I hope many people will write books

01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:38.370
like U.C. Rai has written.

01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:44.290
I'm sure books can be written by every doctor.

01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:47.130
Doctor U.C. Rai has worked single-handed.

01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:49.850
Everything he has done single-handed.

01:13:49.850 --> 01:13:52.570
So beautifully he has worked it out.

01:13:52.570 --> 01:13:58.050
So, everybody can publish a book with their experiences,

01:13:58.330 --> 01:14:01.330
with their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

01:14:01.130 --> 01:14:04.290
which will help Sahaja yogis also.

01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:09.410
But it should be honest, very honest book.

01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:12.810
I'm sure such a book will be very much appreciated

01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:17.410
in Sahaja Yoga and we would like to publish such books also.

01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:19.610
All those who have such ideas

01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:25.210
should make an effort to create some new books,

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:30.450
some new ideas, some new creation.

01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:32.490
Is very important

01:14:32.490 --> 01:14:34.530
because in these modern times

01:14:34.530 --> 01:14:37.810
people want to do something new,

01:14:37.810 --> 01:14:40.730
something novel.

01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:43.530
Under these circumstances,

01:14:43.530 --> 01:14:46.330
I'm sure you all will work out.

01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:50.410
So, all the time we have to think about Sahaja Yoga

01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:55.530
and jot it down whatever ideas are coming into your mind

01:14:55.530 --> 01:14:59.370
and then these can be properly put together,

01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:03.330
making a beautiful book of Sahaja Yoga.

01:15:03.330 --> 01:15:06.330
Ladies also have lots of chances of doing

01:15:06.330 --> 01:15:09.610
so many things for Sahaja Yoga.

01:15:13.690 --> 01:15:17.250
This is a very opportune time.

01:15:17.610 --> 01:15:26.330
I think Satya Yuga is starting from tomorrow. No doubt.

01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:47.370
And what will be the symptom

01:15:47.370 --> 01:15:53.290
that now the satya will be victorious, vijaya.

01:16:02.050 --> 01:16:04.330
Whatever people may try,

01:16:04.330 --> 01:16:07.250
ultimately satya will be vijaya.

01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:08.730
Satyame vijayate.

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:13.650
That's going to happen and you are responsible.

01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:21.490
For this I congratulate you again and again.

01:16:21.490 --> 01:16:25.170
And I hope you will have the commitment to do that.

01:16:25.170 --> 01:16:28.730
May God bless you all.
