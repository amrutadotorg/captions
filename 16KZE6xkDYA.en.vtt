00:09.357 --> 00:11.896
Keep your eyes  closed.

00:12.660 --> 00:17.340
First of all, please put your
right hand on your heart.

00:17.340 --> 00:20.220
All the time, the left hand is towards Me.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.020
Now.

00:23.100 --> 00:31.740
Here you have to say, in your heart, with
all sincerity “Mother, am I the Spirit?”.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.080
Ask the question three times in your heart.

00:34.680 --> 00:36.600
This is a very fundamental question.

00:55.767 --> 01:06.037
Now bring the right hand onto the left-hand
side of your stomach, in the upper part.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.180
Here press it.

01:09.180 --> 01:12.941
Now, this is the centre of your mastery,

01:13.260 --> 01:21.698
your guidance, your ‘Guru Tattwa’ as they say.
So ask a question, “Mother, am I my own master?”.

01:22.200 --> 01:27.356
This is a question to be asked three
times, “Mother, am I my own master?”.

01:41.940 --> 01:49.579
Now, bring your right hand down below,
in the lower part of the abdomen.

01:50.160 --> 02:00.292
Now, this is the centre from which all the
divine work is done, all the pure work is done.

02:00.780 --> 02:05.700
So to ask Me six times, because
this centre has got six petals.

02:05.700 --> 02:09.360
“Mother, please, give me pure knowledge."

02:11.520 --> 02:14.126
Six times you just ask.

02:14.700 --> 02:20.252
As a result of this asking, the
Kundalini starts getting awakened.

02:31.320 --> 02:35.340
Now to help the Kundalini to rise,
you have to cooperate with her.

02:35.340 --> 02:39.420
So please, put your right
hand on the left-hand side,

02:39.420 --> 02:47.760
in the upper part of your abdomen and
press it, on your stomach.

02:48.900 --> 02:57.000
Now here you have to say with full
confidence, to help the Kundalini to rise,

02:57.000 --> 03:00.900
“Mother, I am my own master."

03:00.900 --> 03:03.506
This you have to say ten times.

03:03.660 --> 03:12.348
These are the Ten Commandments which you have
to say, that, “Mother, I am my own master."

03:50.940 --> 03:54.773
Ten times with full confidence.

03:55.140 --> 04:00.130
Now, please raise your right hand to your heart.

04:04.200 --> 04:13.625
Now, here you have to say, again with full
confidence, “Mother, I am the Spirit."

04:13.625 --> 04:16.019
This is the truth, you are the Spirit,

04:16.019 --> 04:21.537
but you have to say with full
confidence, “Mother, I am the Spirit."

04:22.260 --> 04:25.232
This you have to say twelve times.

04:53.598 --> 05:00.678
Now, one has to know that God
Almighty is the ocean of love.

05:00.720 --> 05:04.680
But above all, He’s the ocean of forgiveness.

05:05.640 --> 05:09.420
So He forgives; whatever wrong you do He forgives.

05:10.140 --> 05:15.621
So don’t feel guilty and
put your right hand across,

05:17.700 --> 05:25.671
on the left-hand side, in the corner which
is made by your neck and your shoulder.

05:26.220 --> 05:30.180
Now here you have to say,
again with full confidence,

05:30.180 --> 05:34.200
sixteen times, “Mother, I am not guilty."

05:34.200 --> 05:37.380
Please say it, “Mother, I am not guilty."

05:37.380 --> 05:39.469
Sixteen times.

05:40.860 --> 05:42.480
“I’m not guilty at all."

05:44.520 --> 05:45.420
Please say it.

05:50.453 --> 05:52.733
Please say it.

06:15.177 --> 06:17.174
Very hot.

06:22.210 --> 06:27.768
Now raise your hand across on your forehead.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.292
And is a very important centre.

06:33.480 --> 06:42.703
Here you have to say from your
heart, “Mother, I forgive everyone."

06:42.703 --> 06:44.760
Please say it from your heart.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.680
How many times, is not the point.

06:46.680 --> 06:51.055
“Mother, I forgive everyone."

06:51.055 --> 06:55.020
You know some would say that
is very difficult to forgive.

06:55.020 --> 07:03.905
But it’s a myth that we do not forgive or we
forgive, we do not do anything in both the cases.

07:03.905 --> 07:07.860
But if we don’t forgive, then
we play into wrong hands.

07:07.860 --> 07:13.140
So please say from your heart,
“Mother, I forgive everyone."

07:22.337 --> 07:29.400
Now please take your hand on the Back Agnya,
the same centre on the backside of your head,

07:29.400 --> 07:34.020
and allow your head to rest on
it and push it back a little bit.

07:35.340 --> 07:44.520
Now here you have to say, for your satisfaction
because you always feel guilty, that,

07:45.060 --> 07:51.438
“Oh, Divine, if I have done
anything wrong, please forgive me."

07:57.300 --> 07:59.836
“Please, forgive me."

08:01.800 --> 08:03.793
From your heart.

08:05.940 --> 08:15.300
Stretch your hand fully and put your centre
of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area,

08:15.300 --> 08:21.502
which was a very soft bone in your childhood.

08:21.502 --> 08:28.522
Press it hard, press hard your scalp.
Now you have to move it seven times,

08:28.522 --> 08:36.040
saying one thing, which you have to ask for,
“Mother, please, give us my Self-realization."

08:36.040 --> 08:39.905
Because I cannot force on
you, so you’ve to ask for it.

08:40.080 --> 08:43.838
Seven times, press it hard
and move it seven times.

08:43.838 --> 08:46.185
Very hard.

08:48.780 --> 08:50.160
Slowly.

08:50.580 --> 08:53.211
Saying that.
