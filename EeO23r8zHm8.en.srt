1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,580
Now, the question is, for a modern man,
whether to believe

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,860
that there are spirits or not.

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,780
Because it’s a very unknown area.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,980
And the unknown area,

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,500
unless and until it is fully explored
and found out,

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:28,340
always creates a hallucination
that it is something divine.

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,260
So we have to know even about spirits:

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,500
who are they, how they act,
and how they work out.

9
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:39,420
Now, many will say
that “We do not believe in spirits.”

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,260
Whether you believe it or not —
but they are there.

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,420
Christ, He was not a liar.

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:48,060
He took out spirits
and put them in the pig.

13
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,740
And He is the man who very clearly said
that “Keep away from the spirits.”

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,700
The spirits are the people.

15
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,780
We can be spirits tomorrow
if we want to be.

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,060
When we die, we do not die fully.

17
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:13,540
Only the element of earth,
which has created us…

18
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,420
for appearance, or which is the…

19
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,460
we can say, the Jala Tattva
[Water Principle], with the gross form —

20
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,260
that portion only dies,
the rest of it remains.

21
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,220
And it goes into an area

22
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,260
which we call as Pretaloka
[the world of the dead],

23
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,700
where it starts becoming
smaller and smaller

24
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,260
till it comes to the size

25
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,780
of a foetus,

26
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,420
or, you can say, a very small foetus.

27
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,620
It waits there.

28
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,940
But some of the people, when they die,

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,660
they are dissatisfied souls.

30
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,500
In Sanskrit we call them
as atrupta atma [unsatisfied soul].

31
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:11,140
Means, in life they have been hankering
after things too much,

32
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:17,100
and they couldn’t get to their goals,
and they died.

33
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,060
For example, a mother dies
during labour pains.

34
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,060
Her child is born;
she sees the child and dies.

35
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,100
She is worried
about looking after that child.

36
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,460
A father dies suddenly in an accident.

37
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,180
His children are left behind,

38
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,260
and he is worried about his children
they’re looked after.

39
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,060
There are some people
who are very ambitious in life —

40
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,900
very, very ambitious —

41
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,140
and they die before fulfilling
their ambitions.

42
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,940
They also become spirits.

43
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,900
There are people who have been tortured
and troubled and killed.

44
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,820
They also die, and they don’t want
to live in the Pretaloka,

45
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,620
but they want to trouble the people
who have troubled them.

46
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,100
So there are types and types of people
who become spirits.

47
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,260
We can divide them into two types.

48
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:18,500
One type is the one
which is very aggressive,

49
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,060
ambitious, egoistical,

50
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,900
oppressive person,

51
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,060
who dies and becomes a spirit.

52
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:37,180
That area is known
as the supraconscious area.

53
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:41,500
So many gurus and sadhus [ascetics]
who renounce the world

54
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,900
and go to the Himalayas,
and break their necks,

55
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,780
and do all kinds of frantic things,

56
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,420
which we call as dravidi pranayam
[a roundabout way of doing a thing] —

57
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,860
when they die without Realization,

58
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,260
they also are
on the supraconscious side.

59
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:07,100
And they remain on the right-hand side
of the human being.

60
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,100
On the left-hand side…

61
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,260
“Human being” because human being
is a reflection

62
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:18,460
or, we can say, is the same microcosm
of the macrocosm, which is the Virata.

63
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,260
Hence they are reflected
on the right-hand side of the Virata,

64
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,780
and so we should say

65
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,940
that they are available
on our right-hand side.

66
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,420
The other ones,

67
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,980
we can say that they are… they belong
to the category of the people

68
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,460
who are suppressed, who are oppressed,

69
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,020
who are tortured, who are troubled,

70
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,500
who are debased, who are insulted.

71
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,980
Such people, when they die,

72
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,340
they want to take their revenge
by their sly methods.

73
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,980
So they remain on the left-hand side
of the Virata

74
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,020
and thus are reflected in us also,
in the collective subconscious,

75
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,580
which is on the left-hand side.

76
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:17,980
Basically, these are the two styles
of people who are becoming spirits.

77
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,220
But there can be a mixture,
there can be every type of a spirit.

78
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,420
There could be good spirits also,
good people,

79
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:31,300
who are trying to only help
their families and things like that.

80
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,780
These spirits try to manifest.

81
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,300
For example,
the supraconscious type spirits.

82
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,740
There was a doctor in London, who died.
His name was Dr Lang.

83
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,940
When he died,
he had discovered lots of things,

84
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,820
and he wanted to continue
with his practice in London —

85
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,660
and he was a surgeon —

86
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,700
but he could not do it,
because he suddenly died.

87
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,060
So his spirit entered into a soldier

88
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,380
who was living in…
who was fighting in Vietnam.

89
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,260
And when the spirit entered into him

90
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,940
and told him
that “I am such and such doctor,

91
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,220
you must go and meet my son
and my brother

92
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,020
and tell them that I am within you,”
the soldier could not believe it,

93
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,940
but then he said
that “You come along with me,
and I’ll guide you to that place.”

94
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,420
And he took him to that hospital
where this doctor was working.

95
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,980
The hospital was closed,
the surgery was closed,

96
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,540
so he went and saw the son,
and he told him about this spirit
entering into his body.

97
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,780
The son could not believe it.

98
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,900
So he said that “I will tell you
all the secrets of our life

99
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,500
that we spent together
and which no one knows.”

100
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,700
And when he started
telling him all these things,

101
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,300
he was amazed, he said,
“All right, I’ll open the centre.”

102
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,620
So they opened
a very-big-news organization

103
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,820
known as Late Dr Lang’s International
Curative Centre in London.

104
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,220
Now, this organization
started working long time back,

105
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,260
about, I think, eleven
or twelve years back.

106
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,060
Actually, I came to know about it
because somebody who was suffering

107
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,900
from the treatment
of one of these people,

108
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,220
she came to Me
and she told Me all about this,

109
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:19,220
and she gave Me a pamphlet
in which they had written
all this story about Dr Lang.

110
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,460
And what they used to say —
that “You should write to us
about your illness whatever it is.

111
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,180
And when you write to us,
then we will organize it in such a way

112
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,540
that at such a time, at such a point,
at such a place —

113
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,180
whichever place you suggest —

114
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,900
something will happen to you:
you’ll start shaking in the body

115
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,460
and you’ll get those spirits into you
and you’ll be cured.”

116
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,380
It happened with this lady,
the one who came to Me first
when she told Me.

117
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,220
Then afterwards I’ve met many of them,
even in England I’ve met some of them.

118
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,980
So, when she came to Me…

119
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,900
You see, what was her trouble was…
she said that “I had some trouble.”

120
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,540
I think she had some minor trouble,
which was cured

121
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,420
but was very inconvenient thing
for her —

122
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,940
sort of a… it was a nuisance,
the trouble was.

123
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,900
She was definitely cured with that.

124
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,060
But after, say, five, six years or so,

125
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,860
she started, you see,
shaking her body completely.

126
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,900
Her nervousness was so much
that she couldn’t see Me.

127
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,020
When she sat before Me,
she started shaking,

128
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,260
her hands started shaking,
body started shaking

129
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,060
as if a lunatic would do that
before Me.

130
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,900
So I told her, “See, this gentleman
has come from lunatic asylum,

131
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,100
and he is behaving the same way
as you are behaving.”

132
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,100
She says, “I know.
Because I have a pain here,

133
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,620
I have a problem here…
And I know there’s something wrong.

134
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,580
I am not thinking properly,
and I cannot remember anything.

135
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,860
I am a lost soul,
and I know what has happened to me.

136
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,460
Now what can You do about it?”

137
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,460
Of course, I then cured her, no doubt.

138
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,460
Because in Sahaja Yoga you can —

139
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,580
through vibrations of love,

140
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,260
this Divine Love
which I told you yesterday —

141
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,860
you can give a bondage
to those spirits.

142
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,460
By that bondage,

143
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,540
you can make that bondage pass
into the Pretaloka, and they disappear.

144
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,820
But some of these are controlled

145
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,060
by some of these ambitious
so-called gurus.

146
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,580
Now, these so-called gurus
that you know of —

147
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,580
so-called, they call themselves gurus —
what do they do?

148
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,060
They go… you see, if they find
some evil genius dies somewhere —

149
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,860
they know he is an evil genius —
then they follow his body,

150
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:19,540
they go to smashan [burning-ground],
they try to collect a part of his body,

151
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,060
and they keep it with them.

152
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,740
Now, the spirit, till thirteen days,
moves around the body,

153
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,460
and it starts watching
what is the body doing.

154
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,820
So, when the spirit, you see,
sees that his own part of his body —

155
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,580
which is to form again
in his own body later on —

156
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,300
is missing through these people
and they will be doing something,

157
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,100
so it appears before them,
and they know how to talk.

158
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,860
It’s easy to talk.
Even ordinary spirit person,

159
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,100
if he comes here,
I can make them talk,

160
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,500
and they talk quite a lot,
all kinds of nonsense,

161
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,980
and they also tell about these people
what these people have been doing.

162
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:00,580
So, that spirit then, you know,
is captured by these people,

163
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,620
and they start using
these supraconscious spirits.

164
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,820
These people being crooked

165
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:13,020
and very intelligent people,

166
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,820
they start acting into their hands.

167
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,260
Now, these spirits
are given some names.

168
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,740
Like, they can call them Ram, Krishna…

169
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,180
Some people say Aim,

170
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,420
some says Hrim, some says Klim —
all Goddess’s names, you see.

171
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,900
They can even give the name of Jesus
or something like that.

172
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,900
So, what happens — that, when these…
when you go to these gurus,

173
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,020
then, when you ask them,
they say, “We’ll give you a mantra.”

174
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,860
Now, you think that the mantra-giving
is a very great thing.

175
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,860
You see, so many people
will come and tell Me —

176
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,820
in Marathi also, Maharashtrians
are special ones for this —

177
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,660
that “Mataji, mala kani guru mantra dila
[some guru gave me a mantra].”

178
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,660
After all, a mantra can be given…

179
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,180
say, kay dila mantra “Ram”
[what if mantra “Ram” is given]?

180
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,620
Why do you need a guru
to tell you this? Use your brains!

181
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,220
Now, they go on saying “Ram”,

182
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,780
and this fellow has already connected
them with the Ram

183
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,060
whom they have appointed
to get into this fellow.

184
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,380
So the Ram enters into the psyche
of this person.

185
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,980
Mostly it is through this Agnya Chakra,
which I told you.

186
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,140
Yesterday I described
the whole Kundalini

187
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,820
and its places and everything.

188
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,420
So it enters through this
into the psyche.

189
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,980
When it enters into the psyche
on the right-hand side,

190
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,540
you see, on the ego side
it enters into,

191
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,860
and it starts making the man
very egoistical.

192
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,820
He’ll beat his wife,
he’ll beat his children,
he’ll rave and try to show off.

193
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,060
Sometimes such a man
might get a promotion,

194
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,540
and he’ll become so dynamic,

195
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,380
he will… people will say,
“Oh, what has happened to him?” and…

196
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,580
sort of, you see, his attention,
which was…

197
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,740
was spent in doing other things,

198
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,340
will be diverted
to very ambitious style of work.

199
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,900
Now, he becomes very ambitious,
but he has no dharma in him,

200
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,460
no love in him, no compassion in him,

201
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,300
but he becomes
a very so-called successful man.

202
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,940
For a short time.

203
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,900
But after… I’ve met many like them
in Delhi also,

204
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,460
those who have been
“initiated” like that

205
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:07,220
by paying quite a lot of money
to these swamis and sadhus —

206
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,020
and before Me
they were just rattling like this.

207
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,740
And they said, “Mataji, this is such a lot
we are rattling before You,

208
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,260
but even if we take a… even if we burn
a udbatti [kind of incense sticks]

209
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,100
in the name of God Virata,

210
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,100
we can’t go near a temple,
we can’t go near a church.

211
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,340
If we see anything of God,
we start rattling like this.”

212
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,780
And they all have resigned
from their jobs

213
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,500
and are settled down
as useless people.

214
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,140
This has happened to them
within five, six years time.

215
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,060
Young people, very young.

216
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,180
In Singapore I’ve met one fellow.
No, not — Kuala Lumpur.

217
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,420
You would not believe
he is only twenty-two years of age,

218
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,020
and he is like that now.

219
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,260
And this is the supraconscious style —
they call it transcendental thought.

220
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,340
This is the trance they use.

221
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,780
So, just by giving you one name —
you must also think!

222
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,660
After all, you cannot call like that
your God, the Almighty.

223
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:04,940
By just a name?! How can you call Him!
Is He your servant?

224
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,180
“Rama gari [fellow, man, man servant],
come along.” Can you call Him like this?

225
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,340
“You do my job, You look after my father,
You look after my mother.”

226
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,620
Who are you?

227
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,620
Are you entitled to call like that?

228
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,220
And can you just tell Him
that “You have to…

229
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,540
You better look after everything
that I tell You,

230
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,020
otherwise I’ll give You up.
I have no faith in You.”?

231
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,140
The man in his ego starts thinking
these nonsensical things.

232
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,140
You have to surrender to God.

233
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,620
You have to become one with Him,
you have to be authorized.

234
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,620
Then only you can ask His help.

235
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,900
The another supraconscious people
are another type of…

236
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,820
they work out in this way that, you see,
these people are the Hatha yogis —

237
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,940
so-called Hatha yogis,
because I call them neo-Hatha yogis.

238
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,380
They are not real Hatha yogis.

239
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:55,300
The real Hatha yogis never stay
with the human… normal…

240
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,340
what you call them…

241
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,780
citizens of a city or a village.

242
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,220
They stay in the forest with gurus.

243
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,220
In the Patanjali Shastra,

244
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,380
who is the original writer
of Hatha Yoga,

245
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,380
he has told there are six things
a Hatha yogi has to do.

246
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,260
He has to stay in the jungle
with a guru who is a realized soul,

247
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,340
and he does not have to lead
a married life,

248
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,140
he has to be a brahmacharya,
a celibate person.

249
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,020
And he has to do six things together.

250
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,340
In that, meditation is there,
prana pratishtha [calming of the breath],

251
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,580
pratyahar [withdrawal of the senses],
yama-niyama [“dos” and “don’ts”]…

252
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,580
All these things mean
he has to regulate his life,

253
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,780
he has to lead
a very chaste and holy life.

254
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,660
It is not meant for people
who are householders.

255
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,180
Here now, for fashion’s sake,

256
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,180
the Hatha Yoga has come
to all the people,

257
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,100
and all Hatha yogis as such
get heart attacks.

258
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,500
Yes, they do.

259
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,020
I’ve met a doctor here —

260
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,420
you might be knowing him also very well,
he was a very well-known doctor —

261
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,900
and he was preaching Hatha Yoga,
and he had a heart trouble.

262
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,500
And he was a heart specialist!

263
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,180
And when I met him, I told him,
“Doctor, be careful about your heart.
You are catching on your heart.”

264
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,180
He said, “How can that be?
I’ve taken my cardiogram!”

265
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,220
I said, “Doctor, be careful
and don’t do this Hatha Yoga.”

266
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,660
Because it is an extreme type
of a sadhana [spiritual practice],

267
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,460
which is to be done with a person
who can balance you,

268
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,980
where no other energy is exhausted,

269
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,820
but only thing is,
it is just done for the sadhana,

270
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,900
and your guru works it out.

271
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,540
It is done by very few people.

272
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,540
But nowadays everybody wants to become
a cinema actor and a cinema actress.

273
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,620
Every girl wants to be [UNCLEAR]
certain shapes

274
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,700
that are described
in the beauty contest.

275
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:39,100
I tell you, these proportions
are absolutely satanic.

276
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,700
I’ve read those proportions —

277
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,060
they are not the proportions
of goddesses. Or of gods.

278
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,340
These proportions that are described
in these beauty contest things

279
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,140
are absolutely of dirty women.

280
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,060
These proportions,
if they exist in any human being,

281
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,860
only bad vibrations will come out.

282
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,220
That’s why, you must have seen,
once they win that test,

283
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,500
then you have seen
how they become funny.

284
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,740
These are all human conceptions,
but all the human conceptions

285
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,260
are such foolish things
that they do not know

286
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,660
that they are playing
into the satanic forces.

287
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,260
The idea about cinema actresses,
you see — all the ladies, these days,

288
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,620
even in London,
even ninety-year-old women

289
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,220
want to be actresses.

290
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,060
Are they mad?

291
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,260
They don’t want to be mothers.

292
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,260
And then they will do
all kinds of dieting,

293
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,180
torture their husbands,

294
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,340
and they will… I don’t know
what they are up to.

295
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,980
You have to be good wives,
decent wives.

296
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,020
You have to be good mothers
first of all.

297
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,060
You are married women,
you are not actresses.

298
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:45,300
And the husbands also want
to be actors or what, I don’t know,

299
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,740
that they are at Hatha Yoga.

300
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,140
They want to make their body
very perfect

301
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,780
in those dimensions
that they are described.

302
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,460
Who has said that these dimensions
are the best?

303
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,540
I mean, these days, when you see it,

304
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,820
men, they don’t look like men,
and women don’t look like women.

305
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,940
Women have started looking like men
or like horses,

306
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,980
and men have started
looking like women.

307
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,780
It’s a wretched system.

308
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,860
We have to be women in the full way,

309
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,900
and men have to be men in the full way.

310
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,780
You have heard about Shivaji, Rana Pratap
[legendary Indian warrior kings]…

311
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,980
You have seen their personalities.

312
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,700
You see, all the descriptions
of these personalities

313
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,260
going to drop down like anything

314
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,940
when you see these “actors”
and “actresses”, teeny-leeny people:

315
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:31,860
somebody slaps them once on the face,
the husband falls down dead,

316
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,260
and the wife is running away
with another man —

317
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,180
all sorts of things going on
in this ghor [terrible] Kali Yuga.

318
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,460
This is only you are playing
into the satanic forces. Nothing else.

319
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,540
But these, I tell you,
these supraconscious people

320
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,100
are teaching you all these things.

321
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,780
Then there are people
of extreme nature,

322
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,300
women specially,

323
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,900
who are pativrata
[devoted to a husband], you see.

324
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,220
They are also nonsensical people.

325
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,700
Because, you see,
they think they love their husband,

326
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,700
the whole gods must fall onto them.

327
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,420
Of course, a pativrata
is a very powerful personality.

328
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,700
But she has to be a realized person.

329
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,500
Otherwise, she is not realized,

330
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,580
and she is all the time
making the husband, you see,

331
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,940
a noose around his head all the time —
and using God for it.

332
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,620
Is absurd!

333
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,020
She must allow all the freedom
to the man,

334
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:24,380
to man to understand
the complete play of life.

335
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,380
These women also, when they die,
you see, they are afraid

336
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,900
that their husband might marry
somebody else or whatever it is.

337
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,140
They sit on the husband’s head only.

338
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,460
Then the mothers, some of the mothers
who are so much involved

339
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:42,020
and selfish and self-centred,
only love their own children.

340
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,180
They’ll say:
“He is the only son I have,”

341
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,780
“She is the only daughter I have.”

342
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,980
But what does that mean?
Why are you so misidentified?

343
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,420
How many times you have been born
in this world?

344
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,420
How many children
you have had before?

345
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,340
Why are you so much involved into it,
so much misidentified?

346
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,500
That does not mean
that you kick your children.

347
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,500
Either they will kick their children

348
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,620
or they will be absolutely
downtrodden by the children.

349
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,700
This is the extreme type
of temperament.

350
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,820
Normal people, who love their children,
love other children also,

351
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,660
live in a normal way,
normal, pious married life,

352
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,500
don’t run after other men
and don’t run after other women —

353
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,940
these normal people, when they die,
they go to Pretaloka,

354
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,420
and then they are born again
as good people,

355
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,300
and they, if they are born today,
they get Realization.

356
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
There are kinds and kinds
and types and types.

357
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,980
I don’t want to waste your time
and My time

358
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,260
in describing all these horrid people.

359
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,100
But on the other side,
on the left-hand side,

360
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,020
the debased and the sly
and the horrid and the murderers

361
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,180
and all that — they are all there.

362
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,340
Oh, these are another type.

363
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,340
Now, what these people try to do?

364
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:54,180
You see, sometimes
they will do some sly things.

365
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,700
But when these people enter,
these debased ones,

366
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,540
when they enter into your psyche,
you become lunatic or mad,
or something happens.

367
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,060
They teach you all kinds of things.

368
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,740
They’ll teach you how to drink,
to take to drugs, to do these things;

369
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,820
or if you are taking drinks,
they’ll enter into you.

370
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,180
Because they are drunkards,

371
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,460
so they want to drink more —
so they will drink.

372
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,220
You’ll be amazed, you won’t believe
that in Cuba I met a lady,

373
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,980
she was a very “dainty darling”,

374
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:21,180
and she told Me that she can take
one whisky neat, one full bottle.

375
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,420
I mean, I can’t even look at that bottle
the way she showed Me.

376
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,260
I said, “How do you manage that?”

377
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,900
And her husband said, “Really,
it is true, sometimes she does it.”

378
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,740
So she says, “Do you know,
there’s a very big, huge Negro

379
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,740
who enters into my body.
And then he drinks, not I.”

380
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,380
She sees him coming inside this body.

381
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,700
So these types of people
are the other side,

382
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,740
on the left-hand side.

383
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,460
Now, there are mixture types,
some of them.

384
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,620
You see, they are the people
who believe in God,

385
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,580
and they haven’t found God,
and they have worked very hard…
sort of people.

386
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,700
So they try to give you
little, sometimes, assurances.

387
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,660
For example, yesterday one lady came,
and she told Me,

388
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:06,460
“Mataji, suddenly I found
that there were some chanas [chickpeas]
lying in my house.

389
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,820
I thought they must have been given
by Mataji, so I ate them,
and I got cured.”

390
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:15,180
I said, “Am I mad to give you chanas
and diamonds and this and that?”

391
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,060
And there are some gurus also
who are working out
the so-called materialization.

392
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,340
This is nothing, you see.
Sometimes, you see, you find, in Bombay…

393
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,340
now, you find that suddenly
your something is missing.

394
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,380
Most of the missing things
you’ll find there.

395
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,900
And these are the things
they are passing out to people
like this — come along! —

396
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,740
in a… jadu me [in a magic way].

397
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,460
It is… it is a spirit,
which is transparent.

398
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,900
It is not opaque thing,
you cannot see it.

399
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,900
So, it comes round, picks up anything
it feels like, and it goes away.

400
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,540
And it just disappears.

401
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,660
And it goes, and it can also give it
to some people there.

402
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,220
And this is all the vidya
[knowledge, lore] of spirit.

403
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,700
Now, how are you to know
that this is spirit and not God?

404
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,660
Only ask one question:
what is the interest of God

405
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,620
in giving us all these
nonsensical things

406
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,740
which we are going to leave here only?

407
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,100
When we die,

408
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,820
all our diamonds, all our ornaments —
everything is going to lie down here.

409
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,260
So why should God give us
these things? Is He mad?

410
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,780
You see, if He loves you,

411
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,620
He’ll give you the highest,
the eternal, the greatest,

412
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,300
the one that is promised
in all the scriptures.

413
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,780
And you read all the scriptures.

414
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,220
Do you find this kind of a nonsense
anywhere that Krishna came

415
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,820
and He brought out some rings
and gave it to somebody?

416
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,020
He did not.

417
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,300
I mean, it can be done by Him.

418
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,980
If He wants to do, He can do anything,
but He is not going to steal things.

419
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:00,540
So this kind of supraconscious spirits
and these things do exist,

420
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,780
believe Me, they do.

421
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,660
But there’s nothing important for us,
because one exists in the future

422
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,940
and another exists in the past.

423
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:12,980
We have to be conscious
of the present, present moment —

424
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,140
and this is what Sahaja Yoga is.

425
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,860
That now, at this moment;

426
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,260
you must understand
the dynamics of this moment,

427
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,500
the spontaneity of this moment.

428
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,940
So now people will say, “Then that means,
Mataji, You don’t believe in planning.”

429
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,620
I do not. I do not believe
in human planning at all.

430
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,260
Because when human beings plan,
you know what is the mess they create.

431
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,860
Everywhere in the whole world,
wherever there have been planners,

432
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,500
what has been done?

433
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,820
I’ll give you a simple example.

434
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,460
You plan a wedding, A to Z.

435
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,620
Now, you’ll find, suddenly,

436
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,260
when the bridegroom has to come
from this place to that place,

437
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,100
something will happen
and he won’t move.

438
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,180
He may have to go to the bathroom;

439
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:05,660
maybe he wants to meet his mother,
he will be emotionally tied up;

440
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,460
maybe his mother will come there,
and she might start crying…

441
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,900
If you want to make it
a living marriage,

442
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,060
then you should not plan
in such detail.

443
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:22,180
You must allow the spontaneity,
the blessing of God to work out.

444
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,060
In manner… I’ll give you
one example.

445
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,740
You see, I do not plan out much,

446
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,420
and I don’t bother so much
about this planning out.

447
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,060
Today we wanted to come here
very early.

448
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,660
These people said
we must reach there at six thirty.

449
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,420
I was just laughing. I knew
when I had to reach I would reach,

450
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,340
because, whatever they may try,
we cannot reach early.

451
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,700
[UNCLEAR]?

452
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,980
And I just could not.

453
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:57,500
So why worry? Because I know
we are not going to reach early.

454
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,780
Of course, I mean, today
supposing I have to go tomorrow,

455
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,700
so I have to just buy the ticket
for tomorrow.

456
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,260
Is all right, there’s no planning.
That is to be done today.

457
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,740
But A to Z you start planning
everything,

458
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,860
and suddenly you find this is missing
and the whole thing goes off.

459
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:18,180
Let the spontaneity,
at least in human relationship —

460
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,620
because you are such planners,
you cannot do everything else —

461
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,740
but human relationship, at least,
try the spontaneity to work out.

462
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,220
Now, in the Western countries,

463
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,580
people are understanding
the value of spontaneity,

464
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,620
but they are stupid people,
they don’t know how to harness it.

465
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,380
I cannot even tell you
to what stupidity they go.

466
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,700
If I tell you, you won’t believe.

467
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,100
There are small children,
otherwise I would have told you.

468
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,020
It is impossible to believe
how stupid they are

469
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,300
that they believe in the spontaneity

470
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,540
and the kind of spontaneity
they have done.

471
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:55,780
All the developing countries
are now developing

472
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,580
to be the developed countries,

473
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:02,100
but we must also see in [UNCLEAR]
these developed countries are.

474
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,300
They are stupid people.

475
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,460
They are all right
as far as their work is concerned —

476
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,500
they are all in time, their things
are all clean, spick and span.

477
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,820
But if you see,
their families are broken up.

478
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:20,020
Stupidity to such a limit —
a ninety-year-old woman

479
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,860
having a love affair
with a nineteen-year-old man,

480
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:27,060
and on the front page
their love letters are posted.

481
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:30,620
Every newspaper you have to read,
that is the first break news coming,

482
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,140
and all the men reading
this “great” Romeo-Juliet going on.

483
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,180
Stupid, absolutely stupid!

484
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,140
When you talk to them,
you find they’re such stupid people!

485
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,420
You don’t know where to look
and what to say.

486
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:48,020
You have no idea to what extent
they have gone in stupidity.

487
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,660
Of course, they have Cadillacs,
and they have big cars,

488
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,140
and they have big houses.

489
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:57,900
But sometimes I feel it is donkeys
living inside these beautiful houses.

490
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,420
In certain matters
they are absolutely stupid.

491
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:07,540
In certain matters,
absolutely, we are crooked.

492
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,580
They are innocent, simpletons,
but they are stupid people.

493
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,700
We are crooked.
Now, that point I’ll touch later on.

494
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,900
So, let us see now
that how these two types of spirits

495
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,980
enter into us, into our psyche.

496
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,340
They can enter through this,
they turn this thing.

497
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,460
They turn this portion
and put inside.

498
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:35,020
Now, what happens with that,
with the spirit thing?

499
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,100
There are some —
like Ravan was there,

500
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,100
who could only with speech
he could make people naked, absolutely.

501
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,300
We have got one here,
exactly the same type.

502
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,940
If he goes on giving speech,
people start taking out their clothes.

503
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,020
Now, just think how stupid we are

504
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,940
not to think: “By taking out clothes,
are we going to go near God?”

505
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,660
I mean, what sort of a logic is this?

506
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,060
When we take our bath,
we are all naked.

507
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:05,300
Are we nearer God by that?

508
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:09,300
All sorts of absurd things
are being taught,

509
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,340
and people are accepting.
Thousands of people!

510
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,780
In your great Bombay, there are
so many intellectuals, aren’t there?

511
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,500
Doing such silly, stupid things.

512
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:31,580
Then you will find lots and lots
of people just… organized.

513
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,860
For what?

514
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:37,020
“Oh, there is some gentleman
has come, you know,

515
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,100
and he speaks very well
on this thing.

516
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,820
And he is very good at this,
he’s a very great speaker.” —

517
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,580
“What does he speak?” —

518
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,660
“He speaks about how Radha
and Krishna loved each other.”

519
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,860
Very good idea.

520
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,460
You can have free cabaret,

521
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,660
and you can have free discourses
on all the nonsensical things

522
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,140
debasing God Himself.

523
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:06,500
All these things are so interesting
to human beings!

524
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:11,260
Are they really seeking the truth?
Are they really asking the reality?

525
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,500
They will never read Shankaracharya.
Yesterday I told you.

526
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:18,220
They will never go and find out
what Markandeya had written,

527
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,740
they have no time to find out
what Jesus has to say about it.

528
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,340
They don’t know
what Mohammed Sahib has said.

529
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,780
Nanak has said so many things,
Kabira has said so many things.

530
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,300
They are all fools.

531
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,580
These vice have come
from somewhere to teach us

532
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:41,380
about all the satanic methods
that they want to employ on us.

533
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:45,100
So beware. Be careful.

534
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,980
This is the ghor Kali Yuga.

535
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,660
All these satanic forces are acting.

536
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:57,860
Krishna has said
that “Whenever there is need

537
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,380
to establish the Dharma

538
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,860
and to kill the dushtas [evil people]

539
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,420
and to save the sadhus [good people],

540
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,020
I am born again and again.”

541
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,060
But, I find, who is the sadhu
and who is the dushta?

542
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,420
It is such a mixture!

543
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:19,020
The Satan has entered
into all the sadhus,

544
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,580
and sadhus are absolutely
in a conflict.

545
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,820
This is what Kali Yuga is.

546
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,020
It’s a very delicate matter.

547
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,340
So, in our own being, as I said it,

548
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,380
on the right-hand side
is the supraconscious area,

549
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,900
and on the left-hand side

550
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,140
is what we call
as the collective subconscious.

551
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,140
Nearer your own being

552
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,340
is the subconscious
on the left-hand side,

553
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,540
which we call as the psyche part,

554
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,020
where we store everything
that is dead,

555
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,340
of this life and past life.

556
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,020
And on the right-hand side,
is the preconscious mind,

557
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,420
which we call as mana,
by which we —

558
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,700
I don’t know, “mana” is also
very confusing thing,

559
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,140
but English word is better,
is “preconscious mind” —

560
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,620
with which we plan
and with which we think,

561
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,740
and this body is maintained
through our right-hand side power.

562
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,700
In the centre, we have got
the evolutionary power.

563
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,620
By this power only, we have evolved,

564
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,100
which is the conscious mind.

565
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,220
This moment, now, at this moment.

566
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,340
We can say that the past and future
cross like that,

567
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,900
and in the centre is that point.

568
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,180
Or we can say like this: that the past…
the future and the past,

569
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,460
they pass like this in the centre,
and they pass out.

570
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,060
So the thoughts from the past
come to the future,

571
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,540
and the future to the past,
but they cannot stay at conscious.

572
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,460
For example, I say,
“Now, at this moment, stop it.”

573
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,380
You cannot.

574
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:54,580
Why?

575
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,820
Because of thoughts.

576
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,820
The thought rises,
goes up and falls down,

577
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,020
and disappears like that.

578
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,940
Again, another thought rises,
rises and again falls, and disappears.

579
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:15,740
Now, you can see
the rising of the thought,

580
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,380
but you cannot see
the falling of the thought.

581
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,220
In between these two thoughts,
there is a little gap

582
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,420
known as vilamba [delay]
in the Sanskrit language.

583
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,620
That is the point of conscious mind.

584
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:31,620
The thoughts can come
from the supraconscious side,

585
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,580
or can come
from the collective subconscious,

586
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,620
can even come
from the preconscious,

587
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:39,500
or can even come
from the subconscious.

588
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,580
That’s how the thoughts waves are.

589
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,420
But if you have to jump
into the conscious mind itself —

590
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,300
now, at this moment —

591
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,060
you cannot do it, because at that point
there is no thought.

592
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,780
I am not telling you
all these things of My own,

593
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:03,020
because this has been already
discovered by many psychologists —

594
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:06,180
that one has to jump
into thoughtless awareness,

595
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,700
not into the so-called trance
but into awareness,

596
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,980
which you are completely aware,
but inside there is silence.

597
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:17,740
Now, this silence has been described
by all the scriptures.

598
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,940
And while jumping into that…

599
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:24,180
even the psychologists,
so many of them said

600
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:27,220
that you jump
into an unconscious mind, which —

601
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,860
“unconscious” means
which is not known to us, achetan mana —

602
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,220
which is collectively conscious,
which is universal.

603
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:40,260
For example, we can say Jung is one
of the greatest psychologists,

604
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,340
and I respect him very much.

605
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,500
He has done a lot of work
on the unconscious,

606
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,700
and he has taken many years

607
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,700
to experiment on thousands
and thousands of people

608
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,020
to find out how the unconscious works
through dreams and symbols.

609
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:03,100
Now, he has found out many symbols
appear in the dreams.

610
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,460
For example, a triangle like this
appears in a dream of one man,

611
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,580
pointing downward.

612
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,380
Invariably in all the cases,
wherever such a dream has appeared,

613
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,260
such a man has murdered someone.

614
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,820
Or if the triangle
is just upside down,

615
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,980
means the top is the pointer,

616
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,980
then invariably all these people

617
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,900
who saw this in the dream
and reported to him,

618
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,100
they were murdered.

619
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,700
There are many such things
he has found out.

620
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,580
He has found out another thing
about the Universal Unconscious —

621
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,940
that it always gives you a balance.

622
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,380
By different experiments.

623
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,100
Now, the medical science people

624
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,540
have found out many things
which they cannot answer.

625
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,820
I have told you already
that they have found out

626
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,780
that the acetylcholine and adrenaline,

627
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:02,980
which act through the parasympathetic
and the sympathetic nervous system,

628
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,580
they act very funnily in the body,
and they don’t know

629
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,220
how they are controlled,
by whom, and why they act.

630
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,180
They say the mode of action
of these two chemicals is not known.

631
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,380
That means one thing is sure —

632
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,980
that they cannot explain.

633
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:22,980
So, we have to think: why?

634
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,900
Why a chemical should react
separate, differently?

635
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,980
Because there is a deity
sitting within them!

636
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,860
There is a deity, a living deity

637
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,860
which handles the chemicals
in the way that it likes.

638
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,900
The other day also
I asked you a question:

639
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,780
a medical person,
if you go and ask him,

640
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,940
“If everything, every foreign body
is thrown out of the body,

641
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:47,460
how is it a foetus is accepted,
not only that but nurtured in the body?”

642
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:54,660
So we should know that there is
a Unconscious Universal Being,

643
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,820
which is being accepted
by many people

644
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,740
in the West.

645
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,180
And that’s why they say:
“Let the Unconscious look after.

646
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,100
Let us have the spontaneity,
let it work out spontaneously.”

647
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,500
But they cannot,
they are so complicated now.

648
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:12,540
They have such an analytical mind
that they’ll go on analyzing,

649
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:17,340
and they cannot allow
the spontaneity to work out.

650
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:24,260
They are trying all their methods
to work out the spontaneity,

651
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:31,580
but somebody has to give an impetus,

652
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,980
has to give that triggering,
as you can say.

653
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,140
Because through rationality if you want
to jump into unconscious, you cannot.

654
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,580
Rationality is a very limited stuff.

655
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:48,940
If you want to go to something
unlimited and universal —

656
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,140
which is collectively conscious —

657
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,620
then you have to learn
to be unlimited yourself.

658
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:58,820
Now, how will you do it?

659
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,100
Somebody has to trigger it.

660
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:10,900
You see a light, a dip [lamp, candle]
which is not yet lighted.

661
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,460
It is a limited stuff.

662
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,420
But when you light it,
it becomes unlimited.

663
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:22,620
But for lightening this light,
you have to take another light near it.

664
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,700
When you bring another light near it,

665
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,580
it doesn’t do,
it’s just like a catalytic agent.

666
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,980
It just touches this,
and it starts burning.

667
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,100
It gets unlimited light.

668
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,980
The light becomes unlimited
with a limited dip.

669
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,220
In the same way,
somebody has to trigger this.

670
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:52,300
I give a very, I should say,
a contemporary, or a very modern example

671
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,860
which is very simple
for people to understand.

672
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,980
You see, in our houses, we have seen
all these Bombay gas lights,

673
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,660
we have seen there’s a little flicker
going on. Nobody can see that.

674
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,420
In the same way,
in the heart there is the Spirit,

675
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:09,020
the reflection of God that is there.

676
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:14,820
And the flow of the gas is stopped,
is kept ready.

677
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,780
In the same way,
in you the Kundalini is kept there,

678
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,140
and somebody has to open that.

679
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,540
And when that is just opened,

680
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,540
the Kundalini rises and meets
that flicker, and the light spreads.

681
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,980
And this is what happens
when the light spreads —

682
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,420
that the vibrations start coming.

683
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,940
Thus you jump
into your unconscious awareness,

684
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,660
means you become
a different personality.

685
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,220
As I told you, you are a computer.

686
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,780
But you are not a working computer.

687
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,660
Once you are connected
with the mains,

688
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,020
you become a computer
which is giving information;

689
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,380
suddenly you start feeling
on your fingers all these things.

690
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,620
You start feeling what is…

691
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,860
what are the centres on the other person,
what are not working.

692
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,700
And these centres,
as I explained to you yesterday,

693
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:17,460
have all the physical, mental,
and emotional sides, which they control,

694
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,940
and you can make out
what’s wrong with the person.

695
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,580
You can cure them also
by giving them these vibrations.

696
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:29,420
So, through this computer,
now you get information,

697
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:34,380
you give information,
and also you can correct it.

698
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,740
You can execute also information.

699
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,740
Now, our computers that we have,
they cannot execute.

700
00:39:40,940 --> 00:40:00,340
(Somebody interrupts Shri Mataji,
and She asks not to interrupt Her.)

701
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:09,700
You see, lecturing about Divine
has been done by many.

702
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:14,780
I am talking about actualization.

703
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,900
You become that!

704
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,980
Now, always people say
that “How can it be possible, Mataji?”

705
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,700
I mean, I cannot understand
this question.

706
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,340
Supposing I say
there is a diamond lying here.

707
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,620
Will you ask such a question?
You’ll immediately come pick it up.

708
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,860
I mean, you don’t have to lose
anything by this.

709
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,100
You are not paying Me anything.
It’s all free.

710
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,060
By doing this, you have seen here,
people have been cured.

711
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,180
But once you get it,

712
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,580
fifty percent of you
will feel very happy,

713
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,660
go home and say, “All right, forget it.”

714
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,260
One or two will criticize: “Oh, mala kahi
jhala sei, we didn’t feel anything,”

715
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,740
as if they are very great people.

716
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,020
If they haven’t got it,
there’s something wrong with them.

717
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,220
They should get it.

718
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:11,300
And fifty percent will think about it,
will come again and again, work it out.

719
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,660
There are now in Bombay
some of them,

720
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,540
very highly placed Sahaja yogis,
who are curing people.

721
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,060
They have cured cancer.
They are very ordinary people.

722
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,500
We have one here, a teacher
in the school,

723
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,420
and he has cured people
who were suffering from elephantiasis,

724
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,660
from cancer…
so many things he has cured.

725
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,940
He is a very, very ordinary person
in life.

726
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,900
There are so many like that
who are doing it.

727
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,700
You can also do it.

728
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,020
But you are great babus
[respectable people],
you are great people.

729
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:47,260
You have no time for all this.

730
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,540
When I’ll be no more, then you
will be beating your heads, I know:

731
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:57,060
“I wish we had done
something about it!”

732
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,660
Some of them
have definitely learned the art.

733
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,100
Like, I said that “There’s a fan here.

734
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,220
If I open the fan,
you’ll get cool breeze.”

735
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,700
So you’ll say, “All right. Please open
the fan immediately, we want to have it.”

736
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,580
Normally people would say that.

737
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,020
Then I would say, “All right,
I’ll open the fan. Cool down.

738
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:17,900
Now you feel nice?” — “Yes.”

739
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,980
Then I will tell you
how this fan is made,

740
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:23,420
how the electricity is produced,
all the engineering I’ll tell you.

741
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:27,260
But I have also told you
a little bit of engineering.

742
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,620
All people want to listen to lectures.

743
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,340
Aren’t you fed up of them?

744
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,740
Why don’t you have it?

745
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,420
This is the blessing of God.

746
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,580
You have to jump
into the Kingdom of God,

747
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:52,060
and you just see how you are protected,
how you are looked after.

748
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,580
There are seven chakras,

749
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:59,780
and all the seven blessings
are bestowed upon you with a stroke.

750
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:04,420
We have here people who have been
nothing in life after Sahaja Yoga
[Shri Mataji probably means “before”] —

751
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:09,260
even this one I will give you as a…

752
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:13,540
as a little chocolate
over the castor oil, as they say —

753
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:18,700
that they are also very much
improved materially

754
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,460
because it is Lakshmi
who is sitting in the Nabhi.

755
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:25,220
This may appeal to many in India

756
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,700
that Lakshmi is cured
and you improve even materially.

757
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,540
People get promotions,
they become this, that…

758
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,300
One example is our Dr. Nagensi.

759
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,820
He got his Realization,
and see where he has got.

760
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,660
Many people like that.

761
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,860
He is a Sahaja yogi.

762
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,740
So many people are Sahaja yogis
who have achieved things in life,

763
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,860
but they are busy people,
some of them are.

764
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,020
But if you could devote
a little time for sadhana,

765
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:56,980
and if you come here
and see for yourself

766
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,180
and give more, then you get more.

767
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,700
Because why should God
give you all the time vibrations

768
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,540
when you are not going to use them?

769
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,140
There’s a gentleman sitting here,
his son was suffering

770
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,340
from too much of drug.

771
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,500
He was a young schoolboy,

772
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:14,300
and he was being cheated,
and poor boy has been tried.

773
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,460
He has spent twenty thousand rupees
just curing him.

774
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:20,740
People were just giving him
drugs to sleep and drugs to sleep,

775
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,220
only tranquillizers.

776
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:25,740
And in one day he’s cured, and today
he’s sleeping nicely without anything.

777
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,820
He had brought and showed Me
a prescription which, he says…

778
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,620
Kiti paise bata [tell me how much was it]?
Charshe rupaye —

779
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:34,580
four hundred rupees
poor man had to shell out.

780
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:38,500
And for what? Not for curing!
To make that boy sleep off.

781
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:43,660
I mean, that’s also a kind of a drug.
And that boy is so normal today.

782
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:51,740
But there will be some satanic here
who can create problem for you.

783
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,420
So you decide for yourself.

784
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:56,620
(Shri Mataji says a phrase in Marathi.)

1
00:44:52,557 --> 00:45:19,117
(Shri Mataji asks the audience in Hindi
to ask Her questions.)

2
00:45:19,477 --> 00:45:21,397
(A seeker asks a question.)

3
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:27,399
SHRI MATAJI: How one gets it, isn’t it?

4
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,599
All right, sit down.

5
00:45:28,799 --> 00:45:31,679
That’s what I’ve been saying —
that it just works out.

6
00:45:31,879 --> 00:45:33,999
It is a spontaneous happening.

7
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,999
Now, we’ll see one thing,

8
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:40,039
that how does a little seed
gets into a tree?

9
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:41,759
It’s a living process.

10
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:43,959
You’ll just say it just works out.

11
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:46,719
It is already there,
that’s why it is sahaja.

12
00:45:46,919 --> 00:45:48,799
“Saha” means “with”, “ja” means “born”.

13
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:51,399
It is absolutely spontaneous.

14
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,479
I am an enlightened person, is a fact.

15
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:58,599
And when I touch you,
you get enlightenment yourself.

16
00:45:58,799 --> 00:46:03,159
It’s a very, very simple thing.
All right?

17
00:46:07,279 --> 00:46:08,879
Another question?

18
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:13,639
This was a nice one,
because we always say of “how”.

19
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:17,879
SEEKER: Enlightenment through
other methods,

20
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,119
with siddhis [supernatural powers].
SHRI MATAJI: Huh?

21
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,159
SEEKER: With siddhis,
that’s what they are called.

22
00:46:22,359 --> 00:46:24,439
SHRI MATAJI: No, no, is wrong.

23
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:26,639
That is always been banned.

24
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:31,399
You see, in the olden days also
we had people who were misled.

25
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,199
That is the history.

26
00:46:33,399 --> 00:46:36,199
There are some people…
now, for example, if we had Hitler,

27
00:46:36,399 --> 00:46:39,399
that doesn’t mean he’s a praman
[right measure, authority].

28
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:44,319
If we had somebody like…
a satanic force like Ravan,

29
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:46,239
doesn’t mean that he was praman.

30
00:46:46,439 --> 00:46:50,439
For us, pramani is whatever achieved
the maximum.

31
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:52,439
So the praman always remains the best.

32
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:56,159
You see, all such people
who say that it gives siddhis

33
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:58,879
are the people who are Tantrikas
[followers of the Tantra doctrine].

34
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:01,599
And they were all thrown out.

35
00:47:01,799 --> 00:47:05,039
These are all known as kshudrata
[insignificance, meanness].

36
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:08,999
But some of the people
who have written books on these things

37
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:12,199
are not themselves realized,
have read this book, that book,

38
00:47:12,399 --> 00:47:14,839
and then they have said
that their siddhis are also there.

39
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:18,879
Siddhis are nothing but you move on
to your supraconscious side.

40
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:22,799
And when you move on
to a supraconscious side,
a spirit comes into you.

41
00:47:22,999 --> 00:47:25,959
And then what happens — you start
producing something from your hand…

42
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:28,999
We had one lady in our Sahaja Yoga,
she came to us,

43
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:30,759
and, you know, when I went to America,

44
00:47:30,959 --> 00:47:33,439
she started showing
all kinds of chamatkaras [wonders].

45
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:34,999
She started telling people

46
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,119
that “Where is your money’s lost,
you can find there,” like that.

47
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,799
And she became very popular,
and she used to get one thousand people

48
00:47:40,999 --> 00:47:42,079
everyday coming to her.

49
00:47:42,279 --> 00:47:47,039
And ultimately she started telling them
even the number of the [UNCLEAR].

50
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:51,399
So the supraconscious things
can be like that.

51
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,599
ESP, you become
an extrasensory perceptive man,

52
00:47:54,799 --> 00:47:58,879
and all that is nothing
but another spirit.

53
00:47:59,479 --> 00:48:00,959
But human beings sit tight.

54
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:04,359
You’ll be surprised, from America
two great scientists came just to see Me.

55
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:05,439
For what?

56
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:09,079
They said, “You must teach us how to fly
in the air. We want to leave our body.”

57
00:48:09,279 --> 00:48:11,319
I said, “Why? Are you not flying
already on our heads?

58
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,719
Now what do you want to do?”

59
00:48:12,919 --> 00:48:16,279
They said, “Now we want to leave
our bodies and fly in the air.”

60
00:48:16,479 --> 00:48:17,799
So I said, “But if I tell you

61
00:48:17,999 --> 00:48:20,399
that this is done through the spirits,
will you do it?” —

62
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:21,839
“Yes, still we want to do it.”

63
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:23,039
I said, “Why?”

64
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:26,199
They said, “Because Russians are doing
the same, so we want to do.”

65
00:48:26,399 --> 00:48:30,439
(Shri Mataji says a phrase in Marathi.)

66
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:33,959
Then I said…
and they would not, you see.

67
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:36,479
Then I asked them, “Who told you?”
So they said, “Patanjali.”

68
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:39,959
You know, Patanjali is a newspaper man.

69
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:43,239
And Patanjali… I said,
“Look at this fellow, he came for treatment

70
00:48:43,439 --> 00:48:47,199
because he used to get this kind of a…
experience that used to leave his body,

71
00:48:47,399 --> 00:48:49,279
and he came to Me for getting cured.”

72
00:48:49,479 --> 00:48:53,839
And he is telling him, you go to Mataji
and She’ll make you that!

73
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:57,839
And these fools, you know,
they would not listen to Me!

74
00:49:01,759 --> 00:49:03,119
So, the knowledge that we have…

75
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:06,799
we do not have a proper method
of discrimination.

76
00:49:06,999 --> 00:49:09,079
We don’t know what is
absolute knowledge. This is wrong.

77
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,279
For that, you must have vibrations.

78
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:15,679
With vibrations. Now you can ask,
all those who are realized,

79
00:49:15,879 --> 00:49:19,839
you can ask: “Is there God or not?”
See the answer you’ll get.

80
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:26,359
[UNCLEAR] means yes.

81
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,519
All answers come,
and you can record it on your hands.

82
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:39,079
Even to a small thing.

83
00:49:39,279 --> 00:49:41,959
You must hear Pharkay,
today he was telling Me about this,

84
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:45,719
that when he… some gentleman
was somewhere,

85
00:49:45,919 --> 00:49:47,719
and he said
that “You just find his vibrations.”

86
00:49:47,919 --> 00:49:49,199
So he put his hands there,

87
00:49:49,399 --> 00:49:51,799
and he said, “Let me see the vibrations” —
and nothing was coming,

88
00:49:51,999 --> 00:49:54,479
and nothing you could feel,
and nothing of the chakras.

89
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:57,479
So he then said, “He cannot be there,
because I cannot feel anything.”

90
00:49:57,679 --> 00:49:59,319
So, this man thought of him:
“Oh, yes, yes.

91
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:01,959
He must be on the aeroplane,
he is not there.”

92
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:05,159
To such an extent it goes!

93
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:07,359
In London, there’s one gentleman,

94
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:09,639
he said, “Mataji, can I feel
somebody’s vibrations?”

95
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,079
I said, “You can.” —

96
00:50:11,279 --> 00:50:12,479
“Can I feel my father’s?”

97
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:15,119
I said, “Yes. All right,
you put your hands and ask a question.”

98
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:17,279
Immediately his Vishuddhi Chakra
started burning.

99
00:50:17,479 --> 00:50:18,559
He said, “Mother, this is burning.”

100
00:50:18,759 --> 00:50:20,959
I said, “You telephone to him just now.
Ask how he is.”

101
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:25,519
So his mother said, “He cannot talk
to you, his throat is very bad.”

102
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:30,439
And the father was very far away.

103
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:35,319
“He cannot talk to you,
his throat is very bad” —
Vishuddhi Chakra is catching.

104
00:50:38,279 --> 00:50:41,999
All the information you get
on your hand, on your vibrations.

105
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:46,119
And then, when you’ll see these books,
you’ll be surprised
they’ll be burning your hands.

106
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:49,719
(Shri Mataji says a phrase in Hindi.)

107
00:50:53,919 --> 00:50:58,479
You’ll be amazed that how you find out
who is a real guru and non-real guru.

108
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:00,439
It’s so correct with this!

109
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:03,599
We have got here a case of one lady.

110
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:06,239
She told Me that somebody
came to see her,

111
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:08,319
and, I mean, somebody
came to stay with her,

112
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:10,879
her own brother or someone very near.

113
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:13,719
And she started burning
all the time, this and that.

114
00:51:13,919 --> 00:51:16,079
So she said,
“Do you go to Satya Sai Baba?”

115
00:51:16,279 --> 00:51:17,759
He said, “No.”

116
00:51:17,959 --> 00:51:19,959
She said, “No, but how can that be?
I am getting terrible burning,

117
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:22,079
as I get it from a disciple
of Satya Sai Baba.

118
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:25,559
You must have been somewhere.
You must have been.”
He said, “I’ve never been there.”

119
00:51:25,759 --> 00:51:26,639
So she said, “Really?”

120
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:28,759
And she was searching him out,
and nothing was there.

121
00:51:28,959 --> 00:51:33,799
So she opened his box, and in the box
there was a Satya Sai Baba’s photograph.

122
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,919
Our [UNCLEAR] is here, you can ask him.

123
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,999
His wife… his daughter-in-law
was a big problem in London.

124
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:44,119
And they didn’t know how to locate
why she was behaving like this

125
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:45,959
and she was giving them
burning like that.

126
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:48,919
They opened her purse one day,
and in the purse was that photograph.

127
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,039
The day they threw it away,
everything is all right.

128
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:52,759
Otherwise it was going to be a divorce,

129
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:56,599
for nothing at all — the poor lady
was vomiting, doing all kinds of things.

130
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:59,799
There are so many cases like that.

131
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:05,079
I mean, the proof is there.

132
00:52:05,279 --> 00:52:13,679
(Shri Mataji says a few phrases
in Marathi.)

133
00:52:13,879 --> 00:52:15,559
He called us to some place

134
00:52:15,759 --> 00:52:17,439
where there was a centre
of Satya Sai Baba.

135
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:19,599
He said, “Mataji, You must save
those people.”

136
00:52:19,799 --> 00:52:23,439
When I sat there,
so many children just fainted.

137
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:27,239
Then they told us that “These children
have been fainting like this.

138
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:29,359
You have to do something about it.

139
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:31,519
And so many children are lost.

140
00:52:31,719 --> 00:52:35,399
They just go away.
God knows how they are lost.”

141
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:39,879
I told him, “Baba, his centre,
let him look after now. I am fed up.”

142
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,879
What am I to do now?

143
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:46,519
I must first of all create some doctors,
some realized souls.

144
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:50,639
When I have some more people
to work it out, we can work it out.

145
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:53,799
But one thing is there:
after getting Realization you must come,

146
00:52:53,999 --> 00:52:55,959
and learn it, and master everything.

147
00:52:56,159 --> 00:52:58,799
You become… I tell you,
each and everything of Kundalini,

148
00:52:58,999 --> 00:53:00,719
you can just master it.

149
00:53:00,919 --> 00:53:03,919
It’s very easy.

150
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:05,719
It is so easy and it helps you.

151
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,479
You know this is the power of love;
you must know how it is worked out.

152
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:11,479
We know all the power of hatred only.

153
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:14,359
Supposing somebody
is very unkind to you.

154
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,599
I’ll tell you
about My husband’s secretary.

155
00:53:16,799 --> 00:53:19,079
She got her Realization.
And she said, “I have got neighbours,

156
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,559
some three, four young boys,
and they are horrible hippies.

157
00:53:21,759 --> 00:53:25,679
They are making noise,
and they are troublesome,
and they call me an old hen.

158
00:53:25,879 --> 00:53:28,319
What have I to do
if they just make fun of me?”

159
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:31,079
I said, “All right, what will you do?”

160
00:53:31,279 --> 00:53:33,559
She said, “I’m really fed up,
I’m going to give up the house.”

161
00:53:33,759 --> 00:53:35,519
I said, “You just don’t do like that.

162
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:37,879
You just go and put a bandhan
on their house,

163
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:43,479
every day thrice, like this,
and just think of Me with love.”

164
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,599
Now she says that it is quiet
like a churchyard.

165
00:53:47,799 --> 00:53:48,919
“They are very quiet.

166
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:51,119
And they are very kind,
they open the lift for me.

167
00:53:51,319 --> 00:53:54,319
When I go, they help me.”

168
00:53:59,759 --> 00:54:30,879
(A seeker asks a question in Hindi.
Shri Mataji answers first in Hindi
and then continues in English.)

169
00:54:31,079 --> 00:54:34,079
You are the instrument.

170
00:54:34,879 --> 00:54:37,439
You are the instrument,
you are the medicine,

171
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:40,279
you are the curer,
you are the doctor,

172
00:54:40,479 --> 00:54:44,559
you are the computer,
you are everything.

173
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:48,559
But you should become your Self.

174
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:53,519
You have to become your Self.

175
00:55:00,759 --> 00:55:06,759
(Shri Mataji continues to speak in Hindi.)
