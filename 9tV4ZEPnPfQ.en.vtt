00:05:54.954 --> 00:06:00.391
Hindi

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:04.696
I am sorry I was delayed.

00:06:04.886 --> 00:06:07.766
We were supposed to see the Collector and the

00:06:08.006 --> 00:06:10.286
Tahsildar, as they call him.

00:06:10.526 --> 00:06:13.686
They have done so much for us; so much they have organized,

00:06:13.886 --> 00:06:17.806
all the way, and officially they have done so well,

00:06:18.006 --> 00:06:22.766
that I had to wait for them to thank them very much.

00:06:23.806 --> 00:06:26.966
I think

00:06:27.566 --> 00:06:30.686
it's not very much hot for you, see the

00:06:30.926 --> 00:06:34.726
wind is blowing, can you imagine.

00:06:37.526 --> 00:06:43.846
And if you see, there's no, no leaves, leaves are not moving.

00:06:53.526 --> 00:06:56.766
You always used to go and sit in the sun,

00:06:56.966 --> 00:07:01.486
so now here it is, you'd better have some of it.

00:07:01.686 --> 00:07:06.406
I hope you all enjoyed your stay in Jabalpur

00:07:06.686 --> 00:07:09.206
and the visit to Jabalpur.

00:07:09.446 --> 00:07:13.286
It was quite interesting. Some people have not yet arrived.

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:18.366
I am sorry to say they haven't been able to arrive

00:07:18.646 --> 00:07:22.046
from Bombay.

00:07:22.286 --> 00:07:26.566
I think they are more Bombayites, not from the foreign countries,

00:07:26.766 --> 00:07:30.646
but otherwise I think all of you are here.

00:07:30.886 --> 00:07:35.286
It's a very unusual thing to happen like this, you see,

00:07:35.525 --> 00:07:40.086
this My father built this house about eighty years back.

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:43.126
He was very imaginative and fond of guests,

00:07:43.326 --> 00:07:49.446
so he also put up guest bedrooms and guest bathrooms, such,

00:07:49.686 --> 00:07:53.806
and it was a hill station.

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:58.246
Now of course, because of crowdedness very cold and a hill station

00:07:58.486 --> 00:08:01.646
so people used to come, his friends used to come from Nagpur,

00:08:01.846 --> 00:08:03.446
so he had made arrangements for them.

00:08:03.646 --> 00:08:06.566
There were no hotels or anything so they used to have -

00:08:06.766 --> 00:08:09.766
and the people of this place are extremely hospitable,

00:08:09.966 --> 00:08:12.406
very hospitable.

00:08:12.726 --> 00:08:17.006
So it was his idea that he should have a house here

00:08:17.286 --> 00:08:18.806
where his guests could be.

00:08:19.006 --> 00:08:21.246
His brother had a big house

00:08:21.446 --> 00:08:25.886
but it was joint and he couldn't receive his guests,

00:08:26.166 --> 00:08:31.366
so he thought it's better to build a house here,

00:08:31.606 --> 00:08:34.926
and behind was a huge, big compound bigger than this,

00:08:35.126 --> 00:08:36.246
which I have seen.

00:08:36.446 --> 00:08:39.766
I was only four years of age when we went away from here,

00:08:39.966 --> 00:08:42.326
but I remember each and everything

00:08:42.766 --> 00:08:46.726
about this house, and everything about Chhindwara.

00:08:47.246 --> 00:08:53.366
And you know My memory is unusually, very, very sharp.

00:08:53.606 --> 00:08:58.846
I mean, I remember even My birth, it's to that extent.

00:09:05.086 --> 00:09:08.726
But I never knew that there would be so many saints coming

00:09:08.966 --> 00:09:11.046
to visit this place of My birth.

00:09:11.286 --> 00:09:15.046
I never expected that there would be so many people

00:09:15.286 --> 00:09:17.806
who will take to Sahaja Yoga in My lifetime,

00:09:18.046 --> 00:09:20.966
because when I was born I found people were so blind.

00:09:21.206 --> 00:09:24.006
I thought, "How will I talk about Sahaja Yog? What will I do?

00:09:24.246 --> 00:09:26.686
How will it work out? It's very difficult."

00:09:26.926 --> 00:09:28.726
My father knew about My mission,

00:09:28.926 --> 00:09:31.126
and he told Me that "You'd better find out a way

00:09:31.326 --> 00:09:34.926
by which You can give Realization en masse.

00:09:35.166 --> 00:09:36.566
That was important, because

00:09:36.766 --> 00:09:40.286
even if You give Realization one person, is of no use.

00:09:40.486 --> 00:09:42.046
Also You should not write anything,

00:09:42.246 --> 00:09:45.646
because You don't create another Bible, Gita, Koran,

00:09:45.846 --> 00:09:48.126
because books also bind them.

00:09:48.406 --> 00:09:52.686
So best thing is that You should take to...

00:09:53.286 --> 00:09:54.606
search of human beings,

00:09:54.806 --> 00:09:59.286
why they can't get it, their en masse Realization,

00:09:59.566 --> 00:10:02.206
because now You have come for that purpose."

00:10:02.446 --> 00:10:04.046
Somehow it worked it out,

00:10:04.286 --> 00:10:06.646
and really it was surprising, I was really,

00:10:06.886 --> 00:10:08.966
was not thinking to open Sahasrara,

00:10:09.166 --> 00:10:14.806
but I was literally forced into it and it worked out.

00:10:15.726 --> 00:10:19.166
It's working out. You can see, all of you are here.

00:10:19.726 --> 00:10:24.526
It's very amazing thing that can happen to someone like this,

00:10:24.766 --> 00:10:26.326
that in the lifetime only,

00:10:26.566 --> 00:10:31.686
you have come here to see this birthplace of Mine.

00:10:31.926 --> 00:10:33.966
It was such, such vibrations

00:10:34.206 --> 00:10:38.046
that My Sahasrara became completely jammed with vibrations.

00:10:38.246 --> 00:10:42.886
So cool inside, and outside was so hot that I didn't know

00:10:43.126 --> 00:10:44.686
what was happening.

00:10:44.886 --> 00:10:48.686
So I'm happy all of you could come and see this place,

00:10:48.926 --> 00:10:51.086
and a very humble house it was,

00:10:51.286 --> 00:10:54.446
but in those days it was the most,

00:10:55.166 --> 00:10:58.246
I mean, well-planned house as such,

00:10:58.486 --> 00:11:01.406
and was very much appreciated by people.

00:11:01.646 --> 00:11:05.806
And after that four years I was here,

00:11:06.606 --> 00:11:12.046
and then we went to Nagpur because we had a,

00:11:12.286 --> 00:11:14.126
My father had a big practice in Nagpur,

00:11:14.326 --> 00:11:16.206
he had to go many times down,

00:11:16.406 --> 00:11:18.366
so they thought it's better to go.

00:11:18.606 --> 00:11:20.806
There also he had many houses,

00:11:21.046 --> 00:11:25.166
and Babamama is going to take you round to see those houses.

00:11:25.366 --> 00:11:30.086
He says he'll find out time to see wherever I have lived.

00:11:30.886 --> 00:11:34.006
But Nagpur also is very vibrated place, you can feel it.

00:11:34.206 --> 00:11:38.566
People are very quiet, it's a very quiet place.

00:11:39.006 --> 00:11:42.406
So this is a very novel thing,

00:11:42.606 --> 00:11:45.126
I don't think it has happened in the lifetime of

00:11:45.366 --> 00:11:48.966
any one of the incarnations who came on this earth.

00:11:49.206 --> 00:11:52.006
Even for Rama Janma Bhoomi we are fighting even today.

00:11:52.246 --> 00:11:53.525
So you can imagine.

00:11:53.726 --> 00:11:58.166
Thank God, we have got this place - in a way. It's not yet ours,

00:11:58.366 --> 00:11:59.966
but in a way we are there,

00:12:00.246 --> 00:12:05.966
and maybe with your good wishes we'll own it very soon.

00:12:08.046 --> 00:12:10.486
Today's puja I thought was best to have

00:12:10.686 --> 00:12:13.646
Shri Ganesha Puja in a short way,

00:12:13.846 --> 00:12:17.446
because the first Puja here, and I was born here,

00:12:17.646 --> 00:12:20.446
so it's better that we should have a Ganesha Puja.

00:12:20.686 --> 00:12:24.486
It would be a nice thing to start with,

00:12:24.766 --> 00:12:26.846
and I, we have a doctor here.

00:12:27.086 --> 00:12:29.726
They are all Sahaja Yogis and they are going to help us

00:12:29.966 --> 00:12:32.886
to do the curing. Actually I always thought,

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:35.726
"Which is the place where people will get cured?"

00:12:35.926 --> 00:12:40.366
So now we'll send all of them here to get cured.

00:12:41.726 --> 00:12:43.246
It's a, it was a jungle here.

00:12:43.446 --> 00:12:45.766
All around was jungles, hills,

00:12:45.966 --> 00:12:48.526
but I think all that's finished and broken now.

00:12:48.766 --> 00:12:53.246
And we used to get tigers and things;

00:12:53.446 --> 00:12:56.086
little far away from here is a place called Tamiya

00:12:56.286 --> 00:12:58.966
where they could go see tigers,

00:12:59.606 --> 00:13:02.366
but now they are there no doubt,

00:13:02.566 --> 00:13:07.326
but they are saying that nobody is now going that side,

00:13:07.526 --> 00:13:10.286
they all go to some preserve places

00:13:10.486 --> 00:13:13.086
which you have seen yourself, also Kanha Kisli.

00:13:13.406 --> 00:13:18.046
I hope you enjoyed. How did you enjoy Kanha Kisli?

00:13:20.766 --> 00:13:24.686
And the River Narmada also I was told you enjoyed very much.

00:13:24.886 --> 00:13:27.126
I am happy this has happened.

00:13:27.326 --> 00:13:30.926
It was a little circuitous and quite

00:13:33.086 --> 00:13:36.166
different from all the tours we have had so far,

00:13:37.525 --> 00:13:41.326
but I am happy you all have enjoyed it.

00:13:49.326 --> 00:13:51.406
I have said so many things about Shri Ganesh,

00:13:51.646 --> 00:13:54.046
I don't know what to say now, anymore,

00:13:54.286 --> 00:13:58.126
but all of you have seen that, a place, now see the -

00:13:58.366 --> 00:14:02.206
this breeze is coming from where? I don't know.

00:14:02.486 --> 00:14:06.806
You are sending breeze to Me, instead of I doing it.

00:14:07.006 --> 00:14:08.526
All right.

00:14:14.366 --> 00:14:19.926
[Shri Mataji is starting to talk in Hindi for about 5 minutes}
