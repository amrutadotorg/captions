05:54.954 --> 06:00.391
Hindi

06:02.696 --> 06:04.696
I am sorry I was delayed.

06:04.886 --> 06:07.766
We were supposed to see the Collector and the

06:08.006 --> 06:10.286
Tahsildar, as they call him.

06:10.526 --> 06:13.686
They have done so much for us; so much they have organized,

06:13.886 --> 06:17.806
all the way, and officially they have done so well,

06:18.006 --> 06:22.766
that I had to wait for them to thank them very much.

06:23.806 --> 06:26.966
I think

06:27.566 --> 06:30.686
it's not very much hot for you, see the

06:30.926 --> 06:34.726
wind is blowing, can you imagine.

06:37.526 --> 06:43.846
And if you see, there's no, no leaves, leaves are not moving.

06:53.526 --> 06:56.766
You always used to go and sit in the sun,

06:56.966 --> 07:01.486
so now here it is, you'd better have some of it.

07:01.686 --> 07:06.406
I hope you all enjoyed your stay in Jabalpur

07:06.686 --> 07:09.206
and the visit to Jabalpur.

07:09.446 --> 07:13.286
It was quite interesting. Some people have not yet arrived.

07:13.566 --> 07:18.366
I am sorry to say they haven't been able to arrive

07:18.646 --> 07:22.046
from Bombay.

07:22.286 --> 07:26.566
I think they are more Bombayites, not from the foreign countries,

07:26.766 --> 07:30.646
but otherwise I think all of you are here.

07:30.886 --> 07:35.286
It's a very unusual thing to happen like this, you see,

07:35.525 --> 07:40.086
this My father built this house about eighty years back.

07:40.326 --> 07:43.126
He was very imaginative and fond of guests,

07:43.326 --> 07:49.446
so he also put up guest bedrooms and guest bathrooms, such,

07:49.686 --> 07:53.806
and it was a hill station.

07:54.006 --> 07:58.246
Now of course, because of crowdedness very cold and a hill station

07:58.486 --> 08:01.646
so people used to come, his friends used to come from Nagpur,

08:01.846 --> 08:03.446
so he had made arrangements for them.

08:03.646 --> 08:06.566
There were no hotels or anything so they used to have -

08:06.766 --> 08:09.766
and the people of this place are extremely hospitable,

08:09.966 --> 08:12.406
very hospitable.

08:12.726 --> 08:17.006
So it was his idea that he should have a house here

08:17.286 --> 08:18.806
where his guests could be.

08:19.006 --> 08:21.246
His brother had a big house

08:21.446 --> 08:25.886
but it was joint and he couldn't receive his guests,

08:26.166 --> 08:31.366
so he thought it's better to build a house here,

08:31.606 --> 08:34.926
and behind was a huge, big compound bigger than this,

08:35.126 --> 08:36.246
which I have seen.

08:36.446 --> 08:39.766
I was only four years of age when we went away from here,

08:39.966 --> 08:42.326
but I remember each and everything

08:42.766 --> 08:46.726
about this house, and everything about Chhindwara.

08:47.246 --> 08:53.366
And you know My memory is unusually, very, very sharp.

08:53.606 --> 08:58.846
I mean, I remember even My birth, it's to that extent.

09:05.086 --> 09:08.726
But I never knew that there would be so many saints coming

09:08.966 --> 09:11.046
to visit this place of My birth.

09:11.286 --> 09:15.046
I never expected that there would be so many people

09:15.286 --> 09:17.806
who will take to Sahaja Yoga in My lifetime,

09:18.046 --> 09:20.966
because when I was born I found people were so blind.

09:21.206 --> 09:24.006
I thought, "How will I talk about Sahaja Yog? What will I do?

09:24.246 --> 09:26.686
How will it work out? It's very difficult."

09:26.926 --> 09:28.726
My father knew about My mission,

09:28.926 --> 09:31.126
and he told Me that "You'd better find out a way

09:31.326 --> 09:34.926
by which You can give Realization en masse.

09:35.166 --> 09:36.566
That was important, because

09:36.766 --> 09:40.286
even if You give Realization one person, is of no use.

09:40.486 --> 09:42.046
Also You should not write anything,

09:42.246 --> 09:45.646
because You don't create another Bible, Gita, Koran,

09:45.846 --> 09:48.126
because books also bind them.

09:48.406 --> 09:52.686
So best thing is that You should take to...

09:53.286 --> 09:54.606
search of human beings,

09:54.806 --> 09:59.286
why they can't get it, their en masse Realization,

09:59.566 --> 10:02.206
because now You have come for that purpose."

10:02.446 --> 10:04.046
Somehow it worked it out,

10:04.286 --> 10:06.646
and really it was surprising, I was really,

10:06.886 --> 10:08.966
was not thinking to open Sahasrara,

10:09.166 --> 10:14.806
but I was literally forced into it and it worked out.

10:15.726 --> 10:19.166
It's working out. You can see, all of you are here.

10:19.726 --> 10:24.526
It's very amazing thing that can happen to someone like this,

10:24.766 --> 10:26.326
that in the lifetime only,

10:26.566 --> 10:31.686
you have come here to see this birthplace of Mine.

10:31.926 --> 10:33.966
It was such, such vibrations

10:34.206 --> 10:38.046
that My Sahasrara became completely jammed with vibrations.

10:38.246 --> 10:42.886
So cool inside, and outside was so hot that I didn't know

10:43.126 --> 10:44.686
what was happening.

10:44.886 --> 10:48.686
So I'm happy all of you could come and see this place,

10:48.926 --> 10:51.086
and a very humble house it was,

10:51.286 --> 10:54.446
but in those days it was the most,

10:55.166 --> 10:58.246
I mean, well-planned house as such,

10:58.486 --> 11:01.406
and was very much appreciated by people.

11:01.646 --> 11:05.806
And after that four years I was here,

11:06.606 --> 11:12.046
and then we went to Nagpur because we had a,

11:12.286 --> 11:14.126
My father had a big practice in Nagpur,

11:14.326 --> 11:16.206
he had to go many times down,

11:16.406 --> 11:18.366
so they thought it's better to go.

11:18.606 --> 11:20.806
There also he had many houses,

11:21.046 --> 11:25.166
and Babamama is going to take you round to see those houses.

11:25.366 --> 11:30.086
He says he'll find out time to see wherever I have lived.

11:30.886 --> 11:34.006
But Nagpur also is very vibrated place, you can feel it.

11:34.206 --> 11:38.566
People are very quiet, it's a very quiet place.

11:39.006 --> 11:42.406
So this is a very novel thing,

11:42.606 --> 11:45.126
I don't think it has happened in the lifetime of

11:45.366 --> 11:48.966
any one of the incarnations who came on this earth.

11:49.206 --> 11:52.006
Even for Rama Janma Bhoomi we are fighting even today.

11:52.246 --> 11:53.525
So you can imagine.

11:53.726 --> 11:58.166
Thank God, we have got this place - in a way. It's not yet ours,

11:58.366 --> 11:59.966
but in a way we are there,

12:00.246 --> 12:05.966
and maybe with your good wishes we'll own it very soon.

12:08.046 --> 12:10.486
Today's puja I thought was best to have

12:10.686 --> 12:13.646
Shri Ganesha Puja in a short way,

12:13.846 --> 12:17.446
because the first Puja here, and I was born here,

12:17.646 --> 12:20.446
so it's better that we should have a Ganesha Puja.

12:20.686 --> 12:24.486
It would be a nice thing to start with,

12:24.766 --> 12:26.846
and I, we have a doctor here.

12:27.086 --> 12:29.726
They are all Sahaja Yogis and they are going to help us

12:29.966 --> 12:32.886
to do the curing. Actually I always thought,

12:33.086 --> 12:35.726
"Which is the place where people will get cured?"

12:35.926 --> 12:40.366
So now we'll send all of them here to get cured.

12:41.726 --> 12:43.246
It's a, it was a jungle here.

12:43.446 --> 12:45.766
All around was jungles, hills,

12:45.966 --> 12:48.526
but I think all that's finished and broken now.

12:48.766 --> 12:53.246
And we used to get tigers and things;

12:53.446 --> 12:56.086
little far away from here is a place called Tamiya

12:56.286 --> 12:58.966
where they could go see tigers,

12:59.606 --> 13:02.366
but now they are there no doubt,

13:02.566 --> 13:07.326
but they are saying that nobody is now going that side,

13:07.526 --> 13:10.286
they all go to some preserve places

13:10.486 --> 13:13.086
which you have seen yourself, also Kanha Kisli.

13:13.406 --> 13:18.046
I hope you enjoyed. How did you enjoy Kanha Kisli?

13:20.766 --> 13:24.686
And the River Narmada also I was told you enjoyed very much.

13:24.886 --> 13:27.126
I am happy this has happened.

13:27.326 --> 13:30.926
It was a little circuitous and quite

13:33.086 --> 13:36.166
different from all the tours we have had so far,

13:37.525 --> 13:41.326
but I am happy you all have enjoyed it.

13:49.326 --> 13:51.406
I have said so many things about Shri Ganesh,

13:51.646 --> 13:54.046
I don't know what to say now, anymore,

13:54.286 --> 13:58.126
but all of you have seen that, a place, now see the -

13:58.366 --> 14:02.206
this breeze is coming from where? I don't know.

14:02.486 --> 14:06.806
You are sending breeze to Me, instead of I doing it.

14:07.006 --> 14:08.526
All right.

14:14.366 --> 14:19.926
