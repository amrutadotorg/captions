1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,302
In this totality a world has to be created of people,

2
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:20,080
by the people, who have no fear. This fear has to be given up.

3
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:26,162
Behind all this nonsensical nervousness is fear.

4
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:33,358
So for that, what She does is to give Avaida

5
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:39,415
Under Her protection you are beyond fear, you are protected.

6
00:00:39,496 --> 00:00:42,907
But if you do not want to believe in yourself,

7
00:00:42,988 --> 00:00:49,470
and you don’t believe into Her protection, then no body can help you,

8
00:00:49,697 --> 00:00:54,640
because everything is mythical for you.

9
00:00:56,188 --> 00:01:02,199
In every venture that we take up we should not have any fear

10
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,981
because God is with you. Is a fact, is the truth. You just try.

11
00:01:09,062 --> 00:01:14,155
But when you try through your ego you fall into the trap of fear.

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,201
I have seen egoistical people are the most frightened people,

13
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:21,703
and panicked, because they panic others

14
00:01:21,784 --> 00:01:26,266
and so they think they can be panicked one day.

15
00:01:26,347 --> 00:01:29,893
When the English were here, first of all, in India,

16
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:32,835
we were all frightened of them.

17
00:01:32,915 --> 00:01:38,591
Now I see that in England every English family is frightened of others.

18
00:01:38,672 --> 00:01:43,266
They’ll only open a chink of the door to see who is there, and shut it.

19
00:01:43,347 --> 00:01:47,705
They’re so frightened. I’m surprised,
they are the same English who ruled us here.

20
00:01:47,786 --> 00:01:52,962
And we were so bewitched before them and now
they are the ones who are frightened of us;

21
00:01:53,043 --> 00:01:57,190
because when a person who is egoistical tries to dominate others

22
00:01:57,271 --> 00:02:03,308
he sees himself in the mirror and thinks that the other person will dominate him.

23
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,853
That’s how this fear creeps in, into our minds,

24
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:12,313
and we start getting all kinds of these stupid tantrums

25
00:02:12,394 --> 00:02:15,604
out of this mythical fear.

26
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:20,886
The fear is created by our ego.

27
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:26,763
A person who has no ego, he’ll have no fear
because he has not harmed anyone.

28
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:31,158
Why should he have any fear? And such a man, or such a woman,

29
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:35,537
will be looked after by God, because God takes over.

30
00:02:35,618 --> 00:02:40,493
When you surrender your ego to God He takes over.

31
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:44,132
But those who have ego He says, “All right, go ahead,

32
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:49,357
use your ego, try to protect yourself, cut your throat.”
That’s what it is.

33
00:02:51,545 --> 00:02:55,285
So when I talk of total benevolence

34
00:02:55,366 --> 00:03:00,538
I’m talking about your own total benevolence.

35
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:02,931
So first is the fear,

36
00:03:03,012 --> 00:03:05,876
which should go out of your mind completely

37
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,093
if you believe in the Almighty God.

38
00:03:09,174 --> 00:03:14,581
We’ll say: “You are Almighty God, you
are almighty this thing” It's all lip-service.

39
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:18,528
If you believe that God is almighty, and you are connected with God,

40
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:22,235
then why should you have any fear of anything?

41
00:03:22,348 --> 00:03:26,736
But when we say, “Don’t have fear,” another extreme comes up,

42
00:03:26,842 --> 00:03:29,341
“We don’t have fear, we can do what we like,

43
00:03:29,422 --> 00:03:35,000
we can perform everything ourselves, we need not tell anyone.”

44
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:39,574
You have to tell God whatever you are doing.

45
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:45,800
You have to take permission, you have to inform in His darbar,

46
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:52,467
in His court, that, “Sir, we are thinking of doing such and such thing.”

47
00:03:53,257 --> 00:03:58,800
But you think you are God. You are not.

48
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:02,209
And that’s why the another part of non-fear

49
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,355
is this kind of an arbitrary behavior

50
00:04:05,436 --> 00:04:10,928
which is very dangerous for Sahaja Yoga,
for yourself, and for everybody else.

51
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:22,891
The second fear, I mean, I have, is that if I tell you anything,

52
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:26,462
ninety-nine percent of you understand is for your benevolence,

53
00:04:26,543 --> 00:04:30,330
is for your good. But there is one percent of people

54
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:35,493
who can just react because they have too much ego and they won’t take it,

55
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:39,469
because they don’t think of their own benevolence.

56
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,425
They don’t understand that if I am telling them anything,

57
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:50,717
it is just to give them completeness, totality.

58
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:54,351
But, on the contrary, they take a very wrong attitude;

59
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:59,886
this is another nonsensity. So now one has to develop

60
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:03,675
a kind of a indifference to this kind of people

61
00:05:03,787 --> 00:05:09,342
who unnecessarily go to the other limit of their own destruction,

62
00:05:09,423 --> 00:05:14,157
and don’t want to see what is the point in everything
that I am telling you.

63
00:05:14,237 --> 00:05:16,477
Only I can tell you. Who else?

64
00:05:16,558 --> 00:05:18,535
I have to tell you what’s wrong with you,

65
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:24,418
what you have done wrong, and then you must change it.
