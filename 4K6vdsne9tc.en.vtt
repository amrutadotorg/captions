WEBVTT

00:09.334 --> 00:13.710
Today we have come here

00:16.626 --> 00:18.917
to do Hanumana’s Puja.

00:19.585 --> 00:26.042
Shri Hanumana is a great character in our being,

00:27.460 --> 00:33.042
and He runs all the way from Swadisthana to your brain.

00:35.751 --> 00:41.001
And He supplies all the necessary guidance we need

00:41.334 --> 00:43.834
in our futuristic planning,

00:44.209 --> 00:50.126
or in our mental activities;

00:50.876 --> 00:55.876
He gives us guidance and protection.

01:02.251 --> 01:06.376
As you know that Germany is a place where

01:07.126 --> 01:11.501
people are very active, very right-sided,

01:12.126 --> 01:16.376
use their brain too much,

01:16.834 --> 01:20.750
and they are very machine-oriented also.

01:22.001 --> 01:26.626
It is very surprising how a deity like Shri Hanumana,

01:27.334 --> 01:30.334
who is an eternal child

01:30.710 --> 01:34.751
– because He was like a monkey,

01:35.001 --> 01:36.710
His head was that of a monkey,

01:36.917 --> 01:40.876
if not of an elephant – so He was an eternal child,

01:41.126 --> 01:46.042
and He was the one who was used

01:46.334 --> 01:49.710
to run the right side of human beings.

01:52.917 --> 01:56.126
He was told that “You must control the sun.”

01:56.750 --> 01:58.917
To begin with He has to control the sun,

01:59.084 --> 02:01.959
that the sun in the people,

02:02.251 --> 02:03.543
if there is too much sun

02:03.750 --> 02:05.293
then He must try to control it

02:05.543 --> 02:11.042
and make it cooler, or smoother.

02:12.084 --> 02:17.668
So – He was a child after all, so as soon He was born,

02:17.917 --> 02:21.543
when He knew that He has to look after the sun,

02:21.624 --> 02:23.420
He said, “Why not eat it off?”

02:23.501 --> 02:29.626
So He went, ran up the Virata’s body and ate up the Surya.

02:30.507 --> 02:33.750
There He had to be told,
“No, no, no, no, You have to control Him.

02:33.834 --> 02:36.293
You don’t have to put Him inside your stomach!”

02:36.585 --> 02:41.042
– because He thought that this sun

02:41.376 --> 02:44.876
will be controlled better if He has it in His own stomach.

02:45.376 --> 02:51.710
So the beauty of His character is that

02:51.917 --> 02:57.792
He’s a child, and the child like behavior of Shri Hanumana

02:58.209 --> 03:02.876
has to control the right side,

03:04.001 --> 03:07.876
if there’s a right-sided mother or a right-sided father.

03:08.334 --> 03:12.460
Normally right-sided people don’t get children, normally.

03:13.042 --> 03:15.251
They’re over-right-sided,

03:15.585 --> 03:16.876
then even they get children,

03:17.084 --> 03:19.334
but they are really not liked by the children

03:19.585 --> 03:21.585
because they have no time for children,

03:21.666 --> 03:24.212
they all the time are very strict with the children,

03:24.293 --> 03:26.460
they shout them, shout at them,

03:26.668 --> 03:28.710
they don’t know how to handle the children.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.751
Or they’re over-indulgent,

03:32.209 --> 03:35.543
because they always think that “I never got this,

03:35.751 --> 03:37.876
so let me give it to the child.”

03:38.543 --> 03:40.585
So these extreme type of people

03:40.834 --> 03:45.334
who are right-sided

03:47.001 --> 03:51.668
have got this Hanumana, who is nothing but a child.

03:52.876 --> 03:59.460
He is very anxious, very anxious

03:59.668 --> 04:01.751
to do the work of Shri Rama.

04:02.084 --> 04:05.460
Now Shri Rama is a character, I would say,

04:05.710 --> 04:10.001
which is full of balance, absolutely.

04:10.293 --> 04:13.751
He’s the benevolent king which Socrates has described.

04:14.460 --> 04:18.501
So He needed somebody with Him all the time

04:19.376 --> 04:25.001
to do the work,

04:25.710 --> 04:31.626
or to supply Him or to help Him

04:32.042 --> 04:34.876
– like a secretary you can call Him;

04:36.168 --> 04:38.750
and Shri Hanumana was the one

04:38.831 --> 04:41.290
who was created for this purpose.

04:42.501 --> 04:44.836
Now Shri Rama (Shri Mataji may mean Shri Hanumana)

04:44.917 --> 04:49.460
was such a assistant;

04:49.710 --> 04:52.501
I mean, you cannot have such a word for Him.

04:52.710 --> 04:55.251
We can say He was such a servant of Shri Rama

04:55.501 --> 04:57.460
– even the servants, you see,

04:57.668 --> 05:01.792
don’t have that much of dedication for their master.

05:03.876 --> 05:06.209
We can say like a dog or a horse,

05:06.460 --> 05:13.376
but that also doesn’t have – such dedication for Shri Rama,

05:13.751 --> 05:21.668
that by the time He grew up He got “nau” nine siddhis,

05:21.876 --> 05:23.710
navadha siddhis.

05:23.917 --> 05:25.917
Nine siddhis He got.

05:27.084 --> 05:32.792
These siddhis are like this, that He could become big,

05:33.460 --> 05:37.001
He could become so heavy that nobody could lift Him;

05:38.209 --> 05:41.376
He could become so sukshma that nobody could see Him,

05:41.585 --> 05:44.376
He could become so subtle that nobody could see Him.

05:44.668 --> 05:47.876
There are nine siddhis that He got.

05:49.501 --> 05:56.376
So a person who has got the right side too much in him,

05:56.668 --> 06:00.084
He controls him with these nine siddhis.

06:03.792 --> 06:09.668
Now, how will He control a man who is running very fast

06:10.126 --> 06:11.251
in his life?

06:11.668 --> 06:15.710
What He does is to control his movement,

06:16.001 --> 06:17.751
He makes him in such a way

06:18.084 --> 06:22.710
that he has to put down his speed.

06:23.084 --> 06:25.751
He makes his feet very heavy;

06:26.334 --> 06:28.751
now he can’t do that much.

06:28.917 --> 06:32.334
Or He makes his hands very heavy,

06:32.585 --> 06:36.334
so the person cannot work very much with his hands.

06:36.668 --> 06:47.376
So He can give a tremendous kind of a lethargic heaviness

06:47.668 --> 06:53.460
to a person who is a very right-sided person.

06:56.460 --> 07:00.792
He has got another siddhis which are very interesting, is

07:01.001 --> 07:08.585
that He can extend His – He doesn’t have many weapons,

07:08.751 --> 07:11.084
He has only one gadaa in His hand

07:11.585 --> 07:18.792
– and He can extend His tail to any extent,

07:19.126 --> 07:23.334
and He can handle people with His tails,

07:23.585 --> 07:25.209
He does not have to use His hand.

07:25.376 --> 07:29.209
Sitting down here, He can put the tail around anywhere.

07:29.501 --> 07:34.376
If He wants He can just make a mountain of His tail

07:34.710 --> 07:35.710
and sit on that.

07:36.001 --> 07:38.418
Like He has all these monkey-tricks

07:38.668 --> 07:40.251
as you’re to call them, you see,

07:40.626 --> 07:44.251
and all these things He has within Himself

07:44.626 --> 07:47.501
is to control a person

07:47.792 --> 07:51.418
who is extremely right-sided, to begin with.

07:51.668 --> 07:54.293
Then He can fly in the air.

07:54.543 --> 08:01.168
Just, He doesn’t have any wings,

08:01.418 --> 08:03.501
but He can just fly in the air.

08:03.834 --> 08:07.668
That means He can become so big

08:08.168 --> 08:11.626
that the amount of air He displaces

08:11.917 --> 08:16.293
has a much more weight than His own weight

08:16.501 --> 08:18.376
– just the same principle Archimedes,

08:18.626 --> 08:20.418
if you know the Archimedes principle

08:20.750 --> 08:24.251
– that He becomes so big that His body

08:24.332 --> 08:29.581
starts floating in the air, like a boat, you see, you can call it.

08:30.042 --> 08:32.710
And He can fly in the air,

08:32.917 --> 08:41.168
and by flying in the air He can carry the messages

08:41.418 --> 08:45.168
from one to another, through the ether.

08:45.501 --> 08:49.251
Now the subtle of the ether that we have

08:49.668 --> 08:56.084
is under the command of Shri Hanumana.

08:56.376 --> 08:58.543
He is the one who controls,

08:58.959 --> 09:02.501
or He’s the Lord of this ether, the subtle of the ether

09:02.959 --> 09:06.042
or say, the causal of the ether; and through it,

09:06.251 --> 09:07.418
it communicates.

09:07.750 --> 09:10.042
All the communications that you find,

09:10.251 --> 09:14.750
like we have within ourselves also ductless glands

09:15.042 --> 09:18.376
which the pituitary is using, ductless glands,

09:18.543 --> 09:22.168
is through Hanumana’s movement;

09:22.710 --> 09:25.626
because He can go into a nirakar,

09:25.834 --> 09:27.959
He can go into a formless state.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.501
Also the communications,

09:29.582 --> 09:32.212
we use it for this communication that we have,

09:32.293 --> 09:37.376
maybe we can say that there’s a, we have got a loudspeaker,

09:37.710 --> 09:41.293
but we have a television, we have got radios

09:41.626 --> 09:43.042
and all those things.

09:43.293 --> 09:45.501
Where we catch on to the ether,

09:45.750 --> 09:51.084
anything is all the blessings of Hanumana,

09:51.376 --> 09:54.959
and are available to people who are right-sided.

09:55.376 --> 10:01.126
Only the right-sided people discover these things

10:01.293 --> 10:05.792
of the space, which we call as a cordless telephone

10:05.959 --> 10:10.376
or a thing without – we have also telegraphs and,

10:10.585 --> 10:15.460
where we don’t use any wires.

10:16.042 --> 10:19.042
So without any connection through the ether,

10:19.251 --> 10:20.418
He can manage.

10:20.626 --> 10:27.042
So all the ethereal connections has been done

10:27.293 --> 10:30.168
by this great engineer, Shri Hanumana.

10:30.418 --> 10:33.917
And it is so perfect, it’s so perfect

10:34.168 --> 10:36.376
that you cannot challenge it,

10:36.457 --> 10:38.337
and you cannot find faults with it.

10:38.418 --> 10:40.792
Maybe your instruments may not be all right,

10:41.126 --> 10:44.501
but as far as His ethereal work is concerned,

10:44.750 --> 10:46.293
He’s perfectly there.

10:46.626 --> 10:49.501
Now the scientists discover it and think that

10:49.710 --> 10:55.293
it is in the nature, but they never think, how can it be?

10:55.710 --> 10:57.626
We say something in the ether

10:57.834 --> 11:00.792
and how is it, it is received on the other end?

11:01.042 --> 11:03.751
They just take it for granted that it is so, that

11:03.917 --> 11:07.834
we say something here or we relay something

11:08.168 --> 11:11.626
on the television and it is seen the other side.

11:11.751 --> 11:17.042
But they never even think or search out how it is done,

11:17.376 --> 11:18.334
what is the way.

11:18.626 --> 11:23.626
And this is what is the work of Shri Hanumana,

11:23.834 --> 11:30.834
who has done such a beautiful network,

11:31.376 --> 11:35.545
and through that network all these things work out.

11:35.626 --> 11:39.042
So even on the right side

11:39.543 --> 11:46.209
the vibrations we get in the molecules,

11:47.626 --> 11:50.917
as you know that we get molecules like sulfur dioxide,

11:51.168 --> 11:53.376
if you have the sulfur, has two oxygen,

11:53.543 --> 11:57.959
and the oxygen goes on pulsating like that.

11:58.209 --> 12:00.668
They are asymmetric, symmetric type of vibrations,

12:00.749 --> 12:02.462
you all must be knowing about it.

12:02.543 --> 12:05.668
So all these things, symmetric and asymmetric vibrations

12:05.959 --> 12:08.751
are created by whom? Nobody wants to know,

12:09.042 --> 12:10.293
nobody wants to find out,

12:10.501 --> 12:12.209
because after all in an atom or...

12:12.418 --> 12:17.042
So imagine, in a molecule, that deep, who does that job?

12:17.293 --> 12:21.418
It’s done by Shri Hanuman, in His subtle ways.

12:21.668 --> 12:23.751
So He has another great,

12:23.959 --> 12:31.501
great siddhi which we call as anima.

12:31.792 --> 12:35.168
Anima, anu – “anu” means a molecule,

12:35.710 --> 12:38.376
and that means it can enter into a molecule,

12:38.585 --> 12:42.585
or “renu” is the atom.

12:42.792 --> 12:45.236
It can enter into molecule or into atom.

12:45.317 --> 12:47.420
Now, many scientists think that they have,

12:47.501 --> 12:50.001
in the modern times they discovered the molecules.

12:50.168 --> 12:54.501
It’s not so, because it’s already in our oldest scriptures,

12:54.750 --> 12:59.168
description of anima is there, is of anu, renu is there,

12:59.376 --> 13:02.126
so is already described there.

13:02.710 --> 13:07.626
Now, then whatever, wherever you see

13:08.126 --> 13:12.001
the electromagnetic forces working,

13:12.168 --> 13:16.126
it is worked through Hanumana’s blessings.

13:16.376 --> 13:21.251
He is the one who creates electromagnetic forces.

13:21.585 --> 13:25.376
So now we can see that as Ganesha

13:25.626 --> 13:29.042
has got the magnetic force in Him – He’s the magnet,

13:29.376 --> 13:31.750
He’s the, He has got the magnetic force

13:32.126 --> 13:36.001
– then we can say the electromagnetic is,

13:37.001 --> 13:40.834
is the one which we call as Hanumana’s force,

13:41.126 --> 13:43.126
on the material side of it.

13:43.585 --> 13:50.376
But from the matter He goes up to the brain.

13:50.626 --> 13:56.750
So He rises from Swadisthana up to the brain,

13:57.001 --> 14:03.834
so in the brain also He creates the co-relationships

14:04.293 --> 14:09.460
of the different sides of our brain.

14:09.792 --> 14:11.585
So how much He gives us.

14:11.750 --> 14:16.917
I mean, we can say if Ganesha gives us the wisdom,

14:17.168 --> 14:20.501
then He gives us the power to think.

14:20.792 --> 14:25.293
He protects us also, that we should not think of bad things.

14:25.585 --> 14:27.585
That is, we can say that,

14:27.792 --> 14:32.792
that if Ganesha gives us the wisdom,

14:33.251 --> 14:39.126
then Shri Hanumana gives us the conscience.

14:40.501 --> 14:43.251
I hope you understand the difference between the two.

14:43.501 --> 14:47.251
Wisdom is where you do not need conscience so much

14:47.501 --> 14:50.293
because you are wise, you know what is good, what is bad.

14:50.585 --> 14:53.126
But conscience is needed in a personality

14:53.501 --> 14:56.585
where he is to be controlled,

14:56.792 --> 15:01.168
and that control comes from Shri Hanumana,

15:01.460 --> 15:03.792
which is the conscience in the human being.

15:04.501 --> 15:07.042
Now this conscience which is Shri Hanumana

15:07.251 --> 15:13.168
is the subtle form of Him which gives us

15:13.460 --> 15:16.042
– is in Sanskrit called as “satasat vivekabuddhi”:

15:16.251 --> 15:19.585
means, “sat” means truth,

15:19.876 --> 15:22.042
“asat” means untruth,

15:22.293 --> 15:25.501
and “viveka” means the discrimination,

15:25.750 --> 15:29.585
and “buddhi” means the intelligence.

15:29.792 --> 15:35.917
So, intelligence to discriminate between

15:36.251 --> 15:42.585
the truth and untruth is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

15:43.959 --> 15:46.543
In the Sahaja Yoga system,

15:48.152 --> 15:53.152
if we say that Ganesha is the one who gives us,

15:53.293 --> 15:54.501
He’s the adhyaksha,

15:54.750 --> 15:56.626
means He is the – I call Him

15:56.751 --> 15:59.084
as the chancellor of the university.

15:59.418 --> 16:01.751
He is the one who goes on degree to us,

16:02.042 --> 16:06.543
“Now you have crossed this chakra, that chakra, that chakra.”

16:07.293 --> 16:13.751
And He helps us to know that what state we are in.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.917
So the Ganesha gives us, say,

16:17.209 --> 16:18.626
nirvichara samadhi

16:18.834 --> 16:21.834
which we can call it as the thoughtless awareness,

16:22.042 --> 16:23.834
and nirvikalpa samadhi.

16:24.293 --> 16:28.084
He gives all that, and also He gives us joy.

16:29.750 --> 16:42.084
But the understanding that this is good,

16:42.834 --> 16:45.418
this is for our benevolence,

16:47.293 --> 16:53.750
mental understanding, comes to us from Shri Hanumana.

16:54.042 --> 16:57.959
And it’s very important for Western people

16:58.209 --> 16:59.834
because it has to be mental,

17:00.084 --> 17:02.168
otherwise they won’t understand.

17:02.750 --> 17:05.751
If it is not mental they cannot come into abstract.

17:06.084 --> 17:07.293
It has to be mental.

17:07.668 --> 17:12.626
And so the mental understanding of whether it is good or bad

17:12.917 --> 17:15.668
is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

17:15.917 --> 17:20.626
Without Him, even if you become a saint

17:21.042 --> 17:23.751
you will be – of course, you are a saint

17:24.042 --> 17:26.668
and you will enjoy the saintliness;

17:26.959 --> 17:31.293
but whether this saintliness is

17:31.834 --> 17:33.834
all right if you live on Himalayas,

17:34.042 --> 17:37.917
or is all right when you go across to people

17:38.084 --> 17:41.042
to give them realization – all this scanning,

17:41.293 --> 17:43.668
this vivekabuddhi, all this scanning,

17:43.749 --> 17:47.749
all this discrimination, all this guidance,

17:48.168 --> 17:52.668
all this protection is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

17:53.750 --> 17:56.792
Germany being a country which is very, very much,

17:56.959 --> 17:59.626
I should say, an essence of right side;

18:00.168 --> 18:03.959
and because of it being such an essence of right side,

18:04.168 --> 18:08.042
is important to get the protector of right side

18:08.750 --> 18:10.751
here worshipped.

18:11.293 --> 18:15.418
But in all that vivekabuddhi,

18:15.668 --> 18:18.751
in that discrimination He knows one thing,

18:19.168 --> 18:23.751
that He’s absolutely subservient to Shri Rama.

18:24.334 --> 18:25.750
Now what is Shri Rama?

18:25.876 --> 18:28.042
Shri Rama is the benevolent king,

18:28.209 --> 18:30.418
He works for the benevolence.

18:30.750 --> 18:34.852
And Shri Rama Himself is a formal king,

18:34.933 --> 18:36.959
like sankocha, we call it – I mean,

18:37.040 --> 18:39.420
the English words are not so good to explain this,

18:39.501 --> 18:43.626
but Shri Rama is the one who is,

18:44.917 --> 18:47.042
who will not push forward Himself.

18:47.626 --> 18:50.168
He keeps back. He’s very balanced,

18:50.334 --> 18:52.959
He is a very poised person.

18:53.418 --> 18:55.834
So the Hanumana, you see,

18:56.168 --> 19:00.543
He, He is the one who is always anxious

19:00.751 --> 19:02.917
to do the work of Shri Rama, always.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.959
If Shri Rama says, “All right, you go and get the...”

19:06.293 --> 19:10.209
He told Him, “go and get the...” – sanjeevani

19:10.460 --> 19:14.334
is the kind of a herb that was needed

19:14.668 --> 19:17.418
to bring Lakshmana to life

19:17.750 --> 19:21.293
– He went there and He brought the whole mountain with Him,

19:21.460 --> 19:24.209
“Now, better have it.” It’s like that sort of a person,

19:24.543 --> 19:28.253
you see, so He brought the – that’s childlike behavior of His.

19:28.334 --> 19:33.668
And the discrimination in this is that,

19:33.959 --> 19:36.084
that “If Shri Rama has asked for,

19:36.293 --> 19:38.084
whatever He asks for, I’ll do it.”

19:38.334 --> 19:41.668
So is a relationship of a, I would say,

19:41.959 --> 19:43.834
like a guru and [*]shishya.

19:44.084 --> 19:46.751
But even more than that, that the shishya

19:47.084 --> 19:51.001
is just like a subservient servant,

19:51.209 --> 19:54.334
absolutely surrendered to God,

19:56.750 --> 19:58.834
absolutely surrendered to God,

19:59.084 --> 20:01.293
and His main thing is surrender.

20:01.543 --> 20:05.293
Now see, this surrender itself

20:05.876 --> 20:08.959
shows that all those who are right-sided people

20:09.168 --> 20:14.209
are surrendered to God, not surrendered to their bosses.

20:14.460 --> 20:16.334
Mostly all those right-sided people

20:16.415 --> 20:18.253
are very surrendered to their bosses,

20:18.334 --> 20:20.293
surrendered to their jobs,

20:20.585 --> 20:23.001
sometimes surrendered to their wives also.

20:23.543 --> 20:27.209
But they are subservient to wrong people,

20:27.460 --> 20:29.585
they have no discretion.

20:30.001 --> 20:32.418
You’ll always find that, they have no discretion.

20:32.668 --> 20:35.460
But if you take the help of Hanumana,

20:35.668 --> 20:38.209
then He tells you that you have to be

20:38.460 --> 20:41.834
surrendered to God Almighty and not to anybody else,

20:42.001 --> 20:44.334
or to your Guru like Rama.

20:44.668 --> 20:47.751
Otherwise you are not to be surrendered to anybody else.

20:48.084 --> 20:49.834
And then you are a free bird,

20:50.001 --> 20:53.460
and you have all the nine powers within yourself.

20:53.750 --> 21:01.751
Hanumana’s whole thing is to antidote your overactivity,

21:02.001 --> 21:06.876
to antidote your too-much thinking,

21:07.209 --> 21:09.626
to antidote your ego.

21:09.876 --> 21:14.209
Now, how He finishes the ego of people

21:14.418 --> 21:18.751
is very sweetly shown when He burnt the whole of Lanka

21:19.084 --> 21:26.084
– is the capital of Ravana

21:26.751 --> 21:28.834
– and the way He made fun of him.

21:29.168 --> 21:32.668
Because you see, anybody who is egoistical,

21:33.001 --> 21:36.001
one must make fun of him, then he’s all right.

21:36.293 --> 21:41.418
Like first He went and when Ravana saw Him,

21:41.543 --> 21:44.834
he said, “Who are You? Who are You, the monkey?”

21:45.168 --> 21:48.460
So He just pushed His tail towards him,

21:48.751 --> 21:52.168
and tickled his nose with His tail.

21:55.001 --> 22:00.001
So He’s the one who makes fun of egoistical people.

22:00.293 --> 22:02.668
Now, if somebody egoistical tries to trouble you,

22:02.959 --> 22:05.959
He’s the one; He’ll make such fun out of him

22:06.209 --> 22:08.750
that you’ll be amazed how this fellow was jumping,

22:08.876 --> 22:10.750
like a Humpty-Dumpty has fallen down

22:10.831 --> 22:12.212
and has broken his crown.

22:12.293 --> 22:15.209
So you see, it is the job of Hanumana

22:15.418 --> 22:18.885
to protect you from egoistical people.
