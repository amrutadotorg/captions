00:00:09.334 --> 00:00:13.710
Today we have come here

00:00:16.626 --> 00:00:18.917
to do Hanumana’s Puja.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:26.042
Shri Hanumana is a great character in our being,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.042
and He runs all the way from Swadisthana to your brain.

00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:41.001
And He supplies all the necessary guidance we need

00:00:41.334 --> 00:00:43.834
in our futuristic planning,

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:50.126
or in our mental activities;

00:00:50.876 --> 00:00:55.876
He gives us guidance and protection.

00:01:02.251 --> 00:01:06.376
As you know that Germany is a place where

00:01:07.126 --> 00:01:11.501
people are very active, very right-sided,

00:01:12.126 --> 00:01:16.376
use their brain too much,

00:01:16.834 --> 00:01:20.750
and they are very machine-oriented also.

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:26.626
It is very surprising how a deity like Shri Hanumana,

00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:30.334
who is an eternal child

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.751
– because He was like a monkey,

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:36.710
His head was that of a monkey,

00:01:36.917 --> 00:01:40.876
if not of an elephant – so He was an eternal child,

00:01:41.126 --> 00:01:46.042
and He was the one who was used

00:01:46.334 --> 00:01:49.710
to run the right side of human beings.

00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:56.126
He was told that “You must control the sun.”

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.917
To begin with He has to control the sun,

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:01.959
that the sun in the people,

00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:03.543
if there is too much sun

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.293
then He must try to control it

00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:11.042
and make it cooler, or smoother.

00:02:12.084 --> 00:02:17.668
So – He was a child after all, so as soon He was born,

00:02:17.917 --> 00:02:21.543
when He knew that He has to look after the sun,

00:02:21.624 --> 00:02:23.420
He said, “Why not eat it off?”

00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:29.626
So He went, ran up the Virata’s body and ate up the Surya.

00:02:30.507 --> 00:02:33.750
There He had to be told,
“No, no, no, no, You have to control Him.

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:36.293
You don’t have to put Him inside your stomach!”

00:02:36.585 --> 00:02:41.042
– because He thought that this sun

00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:44.876
will be controlled better if He has it in His own stomach.

00:02:45.376 --> 00:02:51.710
So the beauty of His character is that

00:02:51.917 --> 00:02:57.792
He’s a child, and the child like behavior of Shri Hanumana

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.876
has to control the right side,

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:07.876
if there’s a right-sided mother or a right-sided father.

00:03:08.334 --> 00:03:12.460
Normally right-sided people don’t get children, normally.

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:15.251
They’re over-right-sided,

00:03:15.585 --> 00:03:16.876
then even they get children,

00:03:17.084 --> 00:03:19.334
but they are really not liked by the children

00:03:19.585 --> 00:03:21.585
because they have no time for children,

00:03:21.666 --> 00:03:24.212
they all the time are very strict with the children,

00:03:24.293 --> 00:03:26.460
they shout them, shout at them,

00:03:26.668 --> 00:03:28.710
they don’t know how to handle the children.

00:03:29.084 --> 00:03:31.751
Or they’re over-indulgent,

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.543
because they always think that “I never got this,

00:03:35.751 --> 00:03:37.876
so let me give it to the child.”

00:03:38.543 --> 00:03:40.585
So these extreme type of people

00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:45.334
who are right-sided

00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:51.668
have got this Hanumana, who is nothing but a child.

00:03:52.876 --> 00:03:59.460
He is very anxious, very anxious

00:03:59.668 --> 00:04:01.751
to do the work of Shri Rama.

00:04:02.084 --> 00:04:05.460
Now Shri Rama is a character, I would say,

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.001
which is full of balance, absolutely.

00:04:10.293 --> 00:04:13.751
He’s the benevolent king which Socrates has described.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.501
So He needed somebody with Him all the time

00:04:19.376 --> 00:04:25.001
to do the work,

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.626
or to supply Him or to help Him

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:34.876
– like a secretary you can call Him;

00:04:36.168 --> 00:04:38.750
and Shri Hanumana was the one

00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:41.290
who was created for this purpose.

00:04:42.501 --> 00:04:44.836
Now Shri Rama (Shri Mataji may mean Shri Hanumana)

00:04:44.917 --> 00:04:49.460
was such a assistant;

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.501
I mean, you cannot have such a word for Him.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.251
We can say He was such a servant of Shri Rama

00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:57.460
– even the servants, you see,

00:04:57.668 --> 00:05:01.792
don’t have that much of dedication for their master.

00:05:03.876 --> 00:05:06.209
We can say like a dog or a horse,

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:13.376
but that also doesn’t have – such dedication for Shri Rama,

00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:21.668
that by the time He grew up He got “nau” nine siddhis,

00:05:21.876 --> 00:05:23.710
navadha siddhis.

00:05:23.917 --> 00:05:25.917
Nine siddhis He got.

00:05:27.084 --> 00:05:32.792
These siddhis are like this, that He could become big,

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.001
He could become so heavy that nobody could lift Him;

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:41.376
He could become so sukshma that nobody could see Him,

00:05:41.585 --> 00:05:44.376
He could become so subtle that nobody could see Him.

00:05:44.668 --> 00:05:47.876
There are nine siddhis that He got.

00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:56.376
So a person who has got the right side too much in him,

00:05:56.668 --> 00:06:00.084
He controls him with these nine siddhis.

00:06:03.792 --> 00:06:09.668
Now, how will He control a man who is running very fast

00:06:10.126 --> 00:06:11.251
in his life?

00:06:11.668 --> 00:06:15.710
What He does is to control his movement,

00:06:16.001 --> 00:06:17.751
He makes him in such a way

00:06:18.084 --> 00:06:22.710
that he has to put down his speed.

00:06:23.084 --> 00:06:25.751
He makes his feet very heavy;

00:06:26.334 --> 00:06:28.751
now he can’t do that much.

00:06:28.917 --> 00:06:32.334
Or He makes his hands very heavy,

00:06:32.585 --> 00:06:36.334
so the person cannot work very much with his hands.

00:06:36.668 --> 00:06:47.376
So He can give a tremendous kind of a lethargic heaviness

00:06:47.668 --> 00:06:53.460
to a person who is a very right-sided person.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.792
He has got another siddhis which are very interesting, is

00:07:01.001 --> 00:07:08.585
that He can extend His – He doesn’t have many weapons,

00:07:08.751 --> 00:07:11.084
He has only one gadaa in His hand

00:07:11.585 --> 00:07:18.792
– and He can extend His tail to any extent,

00:07:19.126 --> 00:07:23.334
and He can handle people with His tails,

00:07:23.585 --> 00:07:25.209
He does not have to use His hand.

00:07:25.376 --> 00:07:29.209
Sitting down here, He can put the tail around anywhere.

00:07:29.501 --> 00:07:34.376
If He wants He can just make a mountain of His tail

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.710
and sit on that.

00:07:36.001 --> 00:07:38.418
Like He has all these monkey-tricks

00:07:38.668 --> 00:07:40.251
as you’re to call them, you see,

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:44.251
and all these things He has within Himself

00:07:44.626 --> 00:07:47.501
is to control a person

00:07:47.792 --> 00:07:51.418
who is extremely right-sided, to begin with.

00:07:51.668 --> 00:07:54.293
Then He can fly in the air.

00:07:54.543 --> 00:08:01.168
Just, He doesn’t have any wings,

00:08:01.418 --> 00:08:03.501
but He can just fly in the air.

00:08:03.834 --> 00:08:07.668
That means He can become so big

00:08:08.168 --> 00:08:11.626
that the amount of air He displaces

00:08:11.917 --> 00:08:16.293
has a much more weight than His own weight

00:08:16.501 --> 00:08:18.376
– just the same principle Archimedes,

00:08:18.626 --> 00:08:20.418
if you know the Archimedes principle

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.251
– that He becomes so big that His body

00:08:24.332 --> 00:08:29.581
starts floating in the air, like a boat, you see, you can call it.

00:08:30.042 --> 00:08:32.710
And He can fly in the air,

00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:41.168
and by flying in the air He can carry the messages

00:08:41.418 --> 00:08:45.168
from one to another, through the ether.

00:08:45.501 --> 00:08:49.251
Now the subtle of the ether that we have

00:08:49.668 --> 00:08:56.084
is under the command of Shri Hanumana.

00:08:56.376 --> 00:08:58.543
He is the one who controls,

00:08:58.959 --> 00:09:02.501
or He’s the Lord of this ether, the subtle of the ether

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:06.042
or say, the causal of the ether; and through it,

00:09:06.251 --> 00:09:07.418
it communicates.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:10.042
All the communications that you find,

00:09:10.251 --> 00:09:14.750
like we have within ourselves also ductless glands

00:09:15.042 --> 00:09:18.376
which the pituitary is using, ductless glands,

00:09:18.543 --> 00:09:22.168
is through Hanumana’s movement;

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.626
because He can go into a nirakar,

00:09:25.834 --> 00:09:27.959
He can go into a formless state.

00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:29.501
Also the communications,

00:09:29.582 --> 00:09:32.212
we use it for this communication that we have,

00:09:32.293 --> 00:09:37.376
maybe we can say that there’s a, we have got a loudspeaker,

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.293
but we have a television, we have got radios

00:09:41.626 --> 00:09:43.042
and all those things.

00:09:43.293 --> 00:09:45.501
Where we catch on to the ether,

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:51.084
anything is all the blessings of Hanumana,

00:09:51.376 --> 00:09:54.959
and are available to people who are right-sided.

00:09:55.376 --> 00:10:01.126
Only the right-sided people discover these things

00:10:01.293 --> 00:10:05.792
of the space, which we call as a cordless telephone

00:10:05.959 --> 00:10:10.376
or a thing without – we have also telegraphs and,

00:10:10.585 --> 00:10:15.460
where we don’t use any wires.

00:10:16.042 --> 00:10:19.042
So without any connection through the ether,

00:10:19.251 --> 00:10:20.418
He can manage.

00:10:20.626 --> 00:10:27.042
So all the ethereal connections has been done

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:30.168
by this great engineer, Shri Hanumana.

00:10:30.418 --> 00:10:33.917
And it is so perfect, it’s so perfect

00:10:34.168 --> 00:10:36.376
that you cannot challenge it,

00:10:36.457 --> 00:10:38.337
and you cannot find faults with it.

00:10:38.418 --> 00:10:40.792
Maybe your instruments may not be all right,

00:10:41.126 --> 00:10:44.501
but as far as His ethereal work is concerned,

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.293
He’s perfectly there.

00:10:46.626 --> 00:10:49.501
Now the scientists discover it and think that

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:55.293
it is in the nature, but they never think, how can it be?

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.626
We say something in the ether

00:10:57.834 --> 00:11:00.792
and how is it, it is received on the other end?

00:11:01.042 --> 00:11:03.751
They just take it for granted that it is so, that

00:11:03.917 --> 00:11:07.834
we say something here or we relay something

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:11.626
on the television and it is seen the other side.

00:11:11.751 --> 00:11:17.042
But they never even think or search out how it is done,

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:18.334
what is the way.

00:11:18.626 --> 00:11:23.626
And this is what is the work of Shri Hanumana,

00:11:23.834 --> 00:11:30.834
who has done such a beautiful network,

00:11:31.376 --> 00:11:35.545
and through that network all these things work out.

00:11:35.626 --> 00:11:39.042
So even on the right side

00:11:39.543 --> 00:11:46.209
the vibrations we get in the molecules,

00:11:47.626 --> 00:11:50.917
as you know that we get molecules like sulfur dioxide,

00:11:51.168 --> 00:11:53.376
if you have the sulfur, has two oxygen,

00:11:53.543 --> 00:11:57.959
and the oxygen goes on pulsating like that.

00:11:58.209 --> 00:12:00.668
They are asymmetric, symmetric type of vibrations,

00:12:00.749 --> 00:12:02.462
you all must be knowing about it.

00:12:02.543 --> 00:12:05.668
So all these things, symmetric and asymmetric vibrations

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:08.751
are created by whom? Nobody wants to know,

00:12:09.042 --> 00:12:10.293
nobody wants to find out,

00:12:10.501 --> 00:12:12.209
because after all in an atom or...

00:12:12.418 --> 00:12:17.042
So imagine, in a molecule, that deep, who does that job?

00:12:17.293 --> 00:12:21.418
It’s done by Shri Hanuman, in His subtle ways.

00:12:21.668 --> 00:12:23.751
So He has another great,

00:12:23.959 --> 00:12:31.501
great siddhi which we call as anima.

00:12:31.792 --> 00:12:35.168
Anima, anu – “anu” means a molecule,

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.376
and that means it can enter into a molecule,

00:12:38.585 --> 00:12:42.585
or “renu” is the atom.

00:12:42.792 --> 00:12:45.236
It can enter into molecule or into atom.

00:12:45.317 --> 00:12:47.420
Now, many scientists think that they have,

00:12:47.501 --> 00:12:50.001
in the modern times they discovered the molecules.

00:12:50.168 --> 00:12:54.501
It’s not so, because it’s already in our oldest scriptures,

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:59.168
description of anima is there, is of anu, renu is there,

00:12:59.376 --> 00:13:02.126
so is already described there.

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:07.626
Now, then whatever, wherever you see

00:13:08.126 --> 00:13:12.001
the electromagnetic forces working,

00:13:12.168 --> 00:13:16.126
it is worked through Hanumana’s blessings.

00:13:16.376 --> 00:13:21.251
He is the one who creates electromagnetic forces.

00:13:21.585 --> 00:13:25.376
So now we can see that as Ganesha

00:13:25.626 --> 00:13:29.042
has got the magnetic force in Him – He’s the magnet,

00:13:29.376 --> 00:13:31.750
He’s the, He has got the magnetic force

00:13:32.126 --> 00:13:36.001
– then we can say the electromagnetic is,

00:13:37.001 --> 00:13:40.834
is the one which we call as Hanumana’s force,

00:13:41.126 --> 00:13:43.126
on the material side of it.

00:13:43.585 --> 00:13:50.376
But from the matter He goes up to the brain.

00:13:50.626 --> 00:13:56.750
So He rises from Swadisthana up to the brain,

00:13:57.001 --> 00:14:03.834
so in the brain also He creates the co-relationships

00:14:04.293 --> 00:14:09.460
of the different sides of our brain.

00:14:09.792 --> 00:14:11.585
So how much He gives us.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:16.917
I mean, we can say if Ganesha gives us the wisdom,

00:14:17.168 --> 00:14:20.501
then He gives us the power to think.

00:14:20.792 --> 00:14:25.293
He protects us also, that we should not think of bad things.

00:14:25.585 --> 00:14:27.585
That is, we can say that,

00:14:27.792 --> 00:14:32.792
that if Ganesha gives us the wisdom,

00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:39.126
then Shri Hanumana gives us the conscience.

00:14:40.501 --> 00:14:43.251
I hope you understand the difference between the two.

00:14:43.501 --> 00:14:47.251
Wisdom is where you do not need conscience so much

00:14:47.501 --> 00:14:50.293
because you are wise, you know what is good, what is bad.

00:14:50.585 --> 00:14:53.126
But conscience is needed in a personality

00:14:53.501 --> 00:14:56.585
where he is to be controlled,

00:14:56.792 --> 00:15:01.168
and that control comes from Shri Hanumana,

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.792
which is the conscience in the human being.

00:15:04.501 --> 00:15:07.042
Now this conscience which is Shri Hanumana

00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:13.168
is the subtle form of Him which gives us

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.042
– is in Sanskrit called as “satasat vivekabuddhi”:

00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:19.585
means, “sat” means truth,

00:15:19.876 --> 00:15:22.042
“asat” means untruth,

00:15:22.293 --> 00:15:25.501
and “viveka” means the discrimination,

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:29.585
and “buddhi” means the intelligence.

00:15:29.792 --> 00:15:35.917
So, intelligence to discriminate between

00:15:36.251 --> 00:15:42.585
the truth and untruth is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

00:15:43.959 --> 00:15:46.543
In the Sahaja Yoga system,

00:15:48.152 --> 00:15:53.152
if we say that Ganesha is the one who gives us,

00:15:53.293 --> 00:15:54.501
He’s the adhyaksha,

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.626
means He is the – I call Him

00:15:56.751 --> 00:15:59.084
as the chancellor of the university.

00:15:59.418 --> 00:16:01.751
He is the one who goes on degree to us,

00:16:02.042 --> 00:16:06.543
“Now you have crossed this chakra, that chakra, that chakra.”

00:16:07.293 --> 00:16:13.751
And He helps us to know that what state we are in.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.917
So the Ganesha gives us, say,

00:16:17.209 --> 00:16:18.626
nirvichara samadhi

00:16:18.834 --> 00:16:21.834
which we can call it as the thoughtless awareness,

00:16:22.042 --> 00:16:23.834
and nirvikalpa samadhi.

00:16:24.293 --> 00:16:28.084
He gives all that, and also He gives us joy.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:42.084
But the understanding that this is good,

00:16:42.834 --> 00:16:45.418
this is for our benevolence,

00:16:47.293 --> 00:16:53.750
mental understanding, comes to us from Shri Hanumana.

00:16:54.042 --> 00:16:57.959
And it’s very important for Western people

00:16:58.209 --> 00:16:59.834
because it has to be mental,

00:17:00.084 --> 00:17:02.168
otherwise they won’t understand.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.751
If it is not mental they cannot come into abstract.

00:17:06.084 --> 00:17:07.293
It has to be mental.

00:17:07.668 --> 00:17:12.626
And so the mental understanding of whether it is good or bad

00:17:12.917 --> 00:17:15.668
is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

00:17:15.917 --> 00:17:20.626
Without Him, even if you become a saint

00:17:21.042 --> 00:17:23.751
you will be – of course, you are a saint

00:17:24.042 --> 00:17:26.668
and you will enjoy the saintliness;

00:17:26.959 --> 00:17:31.293
but whether this saintliness is

00:17:31.834 --> 00:17:33.834
all right if you live on Himalayas,

00:17:34.042 --> 00:17:37.917
or is all right when you go across to people

00:17:38.084 --> 00:17:41.042
to give them realization – all this scanning,

00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:43.668
this vivekabuddhi, all this scanning,

00:17:43.749 --> 00:17:47.749
all this discrimination, all this guidance,

00:17:48.168 --> 00:17:52.668
all this protection is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.792
Germany being a country which is very, very much,

00:17:56.959 --> 00:17:59.626
I should say, an essence of right side;

00:18:00.168 --> 00:18:03.959
and because of it being such an essence of right side,

00:18:04.168 --> 00:18:08.042
is important to get the protector of right side

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.751
here worshipped.

00:18:11.293 --> 00:18:15.418
But in all that vivekabuddhi,

00:18:15.668 --> 00:18:18.751
in that discrimination He knows one thing,

00:18:19.168 --> 00:18:23.751
that He’s absolutely subservient to Shri Rama.

00:18:24.334 --> 00:18:25.750
Now what is Shri Rama?

00:18:25.876 --> 00:18:28.042
Shri Rama is the benevolent king,

00:18:28.209 --> 00:18:30.418
He works for the benevolence.

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:34.852
And Shri Rama Himself is a formal king,

00:18:34.933 --> 00:18:36.959
like sankocha, we call it – I mean,

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.420
the English words are not so good to explain this,

00:18:39.501 --> 00:18:43.626
but Shri Rama is the one who is,

00:18:44.917 --> 00:18:47.042
who will not push forward Himself.

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:50.168
He keeps back. He’s very balanced,

00:18:50.334 --> 00:18:52.959
He is a very poised person.

00:18:53.418 --> 00:18:55.834
So the Hanumana, you see,

00:18:56.168 --> 00:19:00.543
He, He is the one who is always anxious

00:19:00.751 --> 00:19:02.917
to do the work of Shri Rama, always.

00:19:03.209 --> 00:19:05.959
If Shri Rama says, “All right, you go and get the...”

00:19:06.293 --> 00:19:10.209
He told Him, “go and get the...” – sanjeevani

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:14.334
is the kind of a herb that was needed

00:19:14.668 --> 00:19:17.418
to bring Lakshmana to life

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:21.293
– He went there and He brought the whole mountain with Him,

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.209
“Now, better have it.” It’s like that sort of a person,

00:19:24.543 --> 00:19:28.253
you see, so He brought the – that’s childlike behavior of His.

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:33.668
And the discrimination in this is that,

00:19:33.959 --> 00:19:36.084
that “If Shri Rama has asked for,

00:19:36.293 --> 00:19:38.084
whatever He asks for, I’ll do it.”

00:19:38.334 --> 00:19:41.668
So is a relationship of a, I would say,

00:19:41.959 --> 00:19:43.834
like a guru and [*]shishya.

00:19:44.084 --> 00:19:46.751
But even more than that, that the shishya

00:19:47.084 --> 00:19:51.001
is just like a subservient servant,

00:19:51.209 --> 00:19:54.334
absolutely surrendered to God,

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.834
absolutely surrendered to God,

00:19:59.084 --> 00:20:01.293
and His main thing is surrender.

00:20:01.543 --> 00:20:05.293
Now see, this surrender itself

00:20:05.876 --> 00:20:08.959
shows that all those who are right-sided people

00:20:09.168 --> 00:20:14.209
are surrendered to God, not surrendered to their bosses.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:16.334
Mostly all those right-sided people

00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:18.253
are very surrendered to their bosses,

00:20:18.334 --> 00:20:20.293
surrendered to their jobs,

00:20:20.585 --> 00:20:23.001
sometimes surrendered to their wives also.

00:20:23.543 --> 00:20:27.209
But they are subservient to wrong people,

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.585
they have no discretion.

00:20:30.001 --> 00:20:32.418
You’ll always find that, they have no discretion.

00:20:32.668 --> 00:20:35.460
But if you take the help of Hanumana,

00:20:35.668 --> 00:20:38.209
then He tells you that you have to be

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.834
surrendered to God Almighty and not to anybody else,

00:20:42.001 --> 00:20:44.334
or to your Guru like Rama.

00:20:44.668 --> 00:20:47.751
Otherwise you are not to be surrendered to anybody else.

00:20:48.084 --> 00:20:49.834
And then you are a free bird,

00:20:50.001 --> 00:20:53.460
and you have all the nine powers within yourself.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:21:01.751
Hanumana’s whole thing is to antidote your overactivity,

00:21:02.001 --> 00:21:06.876
to antidote your too-much thinking,

00:21:07.209 --> 00:21:09.626
to antidote your ego.

00:21:09.876 --> 00:21:14.209
Now, how He finishes the ego of people

00:21:14.418 --> 00:21:18.751
is very sweetly shown when He burnt the whole of Lanka

00:21:19.084 --> 00:21:26.084
– is the capital of Ravana

00:21:26.751 --> 00:21:28.834
– and the way He made fun of him.

00:21:29.168 --> 00:21:32.668
Because you see, anybody who is egoistical,

00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:36.001
one must make fun of him, then he’s all right.

00:21:36.293 --> 00:21:41.418
Like first He went and when Ravana saw Him,

00:21:41.543 --> 00:21:44.834
he said, “Who are You? Who are You, the monkey?”

00:21:45.168 --> 00:21:48.460
So He just pushed His tail towards him,

00:21:48.751 --> 00:21:52.168
and tickled his nose with His tail.

00:21:55.001 --> 00:22:00.001
So He’s the one who makes fun of egoistical people.

00:22:00.293 --> 00:22:02.668
Now, if somebody egoistical tries to trouble you,

00:22:02.959 --> 00:22:05.959
He’s the one; He’ll make such fun out of him

00:22:06.209 --> 00:22:08.750
that you’ll be amazed how this fellow was jumping,

00:22:08.876 --> 00:22:10.750
like a Humpty-Dumpty has fallen down

00:22:10.831 --> 00:22:12.212
and has broken his crown.

00:22:12.293 --> 00:22:15.209
So you see, it is the job of Hanumana

00:22:15.418 --> 00:22:18.885
to protect you from egoistical people.
