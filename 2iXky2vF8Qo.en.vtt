00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:09.250
With love all kinds of creative action takes
place.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:20.940
You see how Raulbai has love for Me and in
this place you all also got new idea of creating

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.030
a beautiful thing.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:30.020
And as love will increase, your creativity
will develop.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.680
So the basis of all creativity, of Saraswati,
is love.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.420
If there is no love there’s no creativity.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.579
It’s even in the deeper sense, you see.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.260
People who have created all the scientific
things are also out of love for the masses,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.720
not for themselves.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.550
Nobody has produced anything for themselves.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.600
If they make something for themselves it has
to become for universal use, otherwise it

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.239
has no meaning.

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.789
Even if you say atom bomb and all these things
that are created from science, they are also

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:09.819
very protective.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:14.969
If they had not created those, people would
not have taken out their minds from war.

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:18.119
Now, nobody can think of having a big war.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.350
Of course, they are having cold wars, but
that also will gradually stop, when they will

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.350
be fed up.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.969
So, all the activity on the right hand side,
of Saraswati, basically has to end up in love.

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.689
Starts with love and ends up in love.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.590
Whichever does not end up in love coils up
and finishes off.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.810
It just disappears.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:48.049
So you can see that even matter, which is
not used for love, just finishes off.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.490
The basis has to be love.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.099
Otherwise all such matter that we create which
has angularity, which is not fitting into

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:02.329
the mass media which is not appealing to the
masses.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:10.069
Of course, it takes time, you have seen that
it takes time - but it does have that tendency

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.269
always to disappear in the thin air as soon
as you find it does not appeal to the masses.

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:24.590
Now this love of, that we talk of, this great
love of God we talk of, we know it for definite

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.689
through vibrations.

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:33.060
People do not have vibrations, but still they
can feel the vibrations in a very unconscious

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.060
way.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.390
All the great paintings of the world have
vibrations.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.010
All the great creative works of the world
have vibrations.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.800
Only those who have vibrations have been sustained
by time, otherwise all other things are destroyed.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.370
There must have been monuments and horrible
statues and horrible things that have been

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.239
created long time back.

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:02.359
But they were all destroyed by nature, and
they could not stand the impact of the Kala

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.099
- that is the destructive power of time.

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:16.620
So, all that is sustaining, all that is nurturing,
all that is en-nobling, comes from this sense

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:24.140
of love, which is within us very much developed,
but within others also, who are not yet realized.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.349
Ultimately the whole world has to realize
that one has to go to that ultimate love of

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.819
God, otherwise it has no meaning.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.770
Now you have seen in art people have taken
to other methods of appealing to people by

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.230
using cheap things and very vulgar things,
just to make people think that this is art.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.110
But this will all disappear.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.280
It cannot sustain the impact of the time as
I told you, it cannot.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.569
Because the time will kill it.

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.720
All these things have to disappear and already
you can see the result, how things are changing

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.580
everywhere, even in the West.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.870
So there is no need to be so much disappointed
with the West and to say that the Western

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.109
world is a wasteland.

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:11.060
It is going to be alright and it has to be
done.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.070
Especially it has done lot of Puja of Saraswati,
I should say, in the West.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.220
Much more than they have done in India because
they have gone to learning and they have tried

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.010
to find out so many things.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.760
But only thing they forgot that it is a Goddess,
Goddess of Learning.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.800
Everything comes from the Goddess.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.440
That’s what they’ve forgotten.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.630
And that’'s why all the problems have been
created.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.610
If there is no Spirit in your learning, if
there is no source of the Goddess in your

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.790
learning, then it is absolutely useless.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:46.540
If they had realized that there is the Spirit
that is working it out, they would not have

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.060
gone that far.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.440
And that’s what I was warning the Indians,
all through, that you are now taking to industrial

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.312
revolution in a way and to avoid all the complications
of industrial revolution, you must try to

00:05:01.312 --> 00:05:03.290
know the Spirit.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.640
If you do not know the Spirit you will have
the same problems as these people have.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.690
Because they are also human beings, you are
also human beings.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.540
You will also go the same way.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.720
At random you will run and there will be problems,
the same problems as the Western people have.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:26.110
Now Saraswati's blessings are so many that
one cannot describe in such a short time.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:32.530
And the Surya has given us so many powers
that it is impossible to tell them even in

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.090
one lecture, even in ten lectures.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:42.900
But how we go against Surya and how we go
against Saraswati, while doing the worship

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.810
of Saraswati, is to be seen very clearly within
ourselves.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.920
For example the Western people are very fond
of Surya because they have no Surya.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:56.930
But they go too far with it, as you know,
and create complications within themselves

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.550
of Surya.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:05.590
But the main thing that one has to achieve
through Surya is the light within, is the

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.890
light within.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:17.340
And if Surya chakra at the Agnya level is
occupied by Lord Jesus Christ then it is even

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:28.600
more essential that the purity of life, what
we call ‘Niti’, is the morality of life.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:35.490
Now morality itself has become very much sort
of an argument in the West.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.960
People don't have any sense of absolute morality.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.800
On vibrations of course you know.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.120
But they have gone all against it.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:50.690
Those who are worshippers of Jesus, those
who are the worshippers of the Surya, of the

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.880
Saraswati have all gone against it.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.330
Against the powers of Surya, just disobeying
it.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:08.270
Because you cannot be a Surya if you do not
have a proper sense of morality and holiness.

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:14.480
The Surya itself brings light, to see everything
clearly.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.050
So many qualities Surya has got.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:22.240
It dries up everything that is wet, dirty,
filthy.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.900
It dries up all these places, which create
parasites.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.170
But so many parasites are created in the West.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:36.340
Not only parasites, but there are horrible
cults and horrible things which have come

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:45.680
into those countries which are supposed to
be full of light, and in that darkness they

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.680
exist.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:55.930
Darkness about their Spirit, darkness about
their own knowledge and darkness about love.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:01.120
These three things have taken over in the
places where you are supposed to love light.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.870
Light doesn’t mean, light doesn’t mean
what you see with your gross eyes.

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:11.390
Light means from within - the Light of Love.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:12.390
That one should understand – Light of Love.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:20.240
And it is so soothing, it’s so sweet, it’s
so beautiful, it’s so enamouring, it’s

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:27.221
so abounding that unless and until you can
feel that light within you - that light which

00:08:27.221 --> 00:08:33.529
is of pure love of purity, pure relationships,
pure understanding.

00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:45.800
If you can develop that kind of a light within
yourself, then the whole thing will be cleansed.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.270
'Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow.'

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:54.530
This is what happens to you when you are completely
cleansed.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:59.930
The purest form of nature is within us.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.200
The purest form of nature is within us.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.270
Our chakras are made out of that purest form
of nature.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:13.910
We are the only people who are spoiling it
by our mental thinking, against the same Saraswati’s

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:14.910
power.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.150
You are going against Saraswati itself.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:24.960
Saraswati cleanses all that is impure in nature,
while, with our brain activity, we are spoiling

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.250
all that.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:31.450
All our brain activity goes against pure intelligence.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:40.500
And that’s what one has to understand - that
this pure intelligence, is not to be soiled

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:41.500
by our thinking.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:48.160
Our thinking can make us so bumptious, so
ego-oriented, so impure, that, we can really

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:58.070
eat the poison and say 'what is wrong with
it'?

00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:00.040
Just the opposite of Saraswati.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.520
If Saraswati is within us, She gives us Subuddhi,
wisdom.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:10.800
And that is why to worship Saraswati, to worship
Surya; we must have that clear vision as to

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.640
what we have to be.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.860
What we are doing.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:16.040
What filth we are living in.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.220
What our mind is getting into.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:23.390
After all we are here for emancipation and
not for just for pampering our ego and living

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.950
with our filth that is with us.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:33.430
So this light has come within us and we should
try to rise above our own mental filth, which

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:38.070
is being created around us.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:45.320
Apart from that, you have to go higher and
understand that there is, within us, a thing

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.320
called ego.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.320
And this ego is false, absolutely false.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.390
You do not do anything.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:58.590
Actually when you turn your eyes here and
there, when your attention is here and there

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:04.120
it is nothing but your ego that is trying
to overpower you.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:11.980
But actually ego is an absolute falsehood
because there is only one ego and that is

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.420
of God Almighty, Mahatahamkara.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:19.861
There is no really any ego that exists.

00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:20.861
It is myth.

00:11:20.861 --> 00:11:26.080
It is a very big myth, because if you start
thinking you are doing everything - you are

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:31.150
doing this, you are doing that - which you
are not doing; then this nonsensical ego comes

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:35.580
in and you start working it out, it can project
in every direction.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:43.430
When it projects forward, it overpowers others,
it tries to dominate others, tries to kill

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.830
others, becomes cruel.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:50.350
When it moves [to the] right side, it becomes
supraconscious.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:55.740
It starts seeing things, which are absurd,
which are foolish, which are stupid.

00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:04.410
When it moves left side then it starts talking
- I mean, seeing things - yourself as a big

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:13.100
man, as a big Christ or as a big Devi or something
like Adi Gurus and 'I am a very great personality'

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.560
- that is left sided.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.810
When it moves backwards, that is the dangerous
one.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.330
When people become gurus, which are ruining
other people.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:27.610
When their ego moves backwards then they become
gurus, they themselves have lots of defects

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:33.290
in themselves and they try to pull people
into those horrible stuff, which is described

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.020
as absolute Naraka.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:40.310
That’s how, is the movement of ego on all
the sides.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:47.730
Now when people try to use their right Vishuddhi
that is, to talk about themselves, is the

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:49.280
worst of all.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:55.050
Whatever type of ego you may have, if you
start boasting about it and talking about

00:12:55.050 --> 00:13:01.490
it, then it encircles, thickens the walls
of ego so much, that it is impossible to penetrate

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.490
into that.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:09.121
Because such a person is completely satisfied
with himself and he believes that he is so.

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:14.800
And once he starts believing into a nonsense
like that, it's an impossibility, is an impossibility

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.440
to penetrate.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:21.790
So, when you boast about these things or you
talk big, be careful.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:27.440
You see, you know what I am, but how many
times do I say 'I am that'?

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.050
Even if I say once, it makes tremendous vibrations
for you.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.839
But how many times do I say so?

00:13:33.839 --> 00:13:36.720
At the most if you say something, I say 'yes'.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.540
But I don't say that.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.730
If I say it loudly, I don't know what may
happen.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.470
The whole thing might be blasted with that.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:50.920
So, one has to understand that Mahatahamkara
is the one that acts, that works, that creates.

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.630
Sometimes I shout at you.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.580
Immediately all the bhoots run away.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.580
Just once I shout.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.600
Yesterday, you saw all the bhoots that were
coughing, they all ran away.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.920
Yesterday just I started.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.690
So you should understand that now you are
a realized souls, you can also do the same.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:10.139
Use your right Vishuddhi to shout at yourself,
‘‘Now will you please stop boasting, will

00:14:10.139 --> 00:14:14.250
you stop talking all this nonsense, will you
stop showing off!''

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:16.970
Then it will stop.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:24.610
Now this thickening takes place by people
who really are active.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.670
Who want to do something about it, not that
they are not active.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:28.730
They want to do it.

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.840
But they know only one way, is to act talkative.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:39.470
They don't understand that there are inner
ways by which you control it much more.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:44.520
Because they don't want to take to that, they
take to this talking.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:49.610
And once they take to talking and they talk
about it, the whole power goes.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:53.720
But if they do not talk about it and keep
it within themselves.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.649
It’s alright, you can tell Me about your
experiences or anything, but if you start

00:14:58.649 --> 00:15:05.300
telling others, and talking about it too much,
then the powers that you have got will all

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.710
be disappearing gradually.

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.960
And you will just come down to absolutely
lowest level.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.830
So one should not too much talk that “I
have this power, I have this power” or “I

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.310
see this” or “I do this,” which is a
very wrong thing.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.950
I warn you, don’t try to show off.

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:23.970
Yes, you can talk about My powers.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:25.130
It is all right.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.860
But don't try to talk about your powers.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:33.600
When it comes, of course, to talk to somebody
who is a negative person or to tell somebody,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.770
then you should say that “we”, not “I”.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:41.670
“We” have, some of us have felt this power
within us.

00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:42.670
We have seen people”.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.529
It may be you only, but you need not say,
'I' have.

00:15:45.529 --> 00:15:47.600
What you have to say is 'We'.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.940
Then you become the Mahatahamkara.

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.440
When you say 'We', Yes some of us', 'we do'.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:16:00.170
Like in Gregoire's book also I made it, I
saw to it, that he should not have many 'I's',

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:01.710
but he should have 'We'.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:03.660
'We think', 'we do', 'we'.

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:08.250
Means, the whole collective being, the whole
collective organism, living organism of Sahaja

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.250
Yogis.

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:15.290
So if you say, 'yes, some of us have got it',
that means, you put yourself down, but put

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:16.590
all others above you.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:17.591
Say: 'Yes, some of us have.

00:16:17.591 --> 00:16:18.990
I know some people have this.'

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:21.410
That’'s the way one should do it.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:28.550
Because if you have to overpower your ego,
you must allow it to spread into everybody

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:29.550
else.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:31.240
That’s how you will make it perfectly all
right.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.240
Let it spread.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.480
“We, all Sahaja Yogis, we all”.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:35.649
But that pride is not there.

00:16:35.649 --> 00:16:38.031
I've seen that pride is not there.

00:16:38.031 --> 00:16:40.500
Still it is very individualistic.

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:47.000
If you start thinking, ''we Sahaja Yogis",
then what happens, that you become one personality,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
one organization.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.200
But the person will look down upon other people.

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.190
He will see that this person is low, that
person is higher, that person is there.

00:16:55.190 --> 00:17:00.420
But he will not think 'We' the Sahaja Yogis,
how beautiful we are.

00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.120
'We' the body of Sahaja Yoga, how beautiful
we are.

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:16.010
So always think in the words of 'we', so your
ego will become much less, much less, much

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.010
less.

00:17:17.010 --> 00:17:23.600
And the same ego, which looked so funny and
absurd, will form tomorrow, the Ekadesha.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:30.799
Today’s, individual ego will merge into
Ekadesha.

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:37.279
But we all must remember to say 'we' all time.

00:17:37.279 --> 00:17:43.330
This is what is today's day, is a great day
for us to change, because the sun has changed

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:44.860
its mood, now.

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.139
Sun is coming this side.

00:17:46.139 --> 00:17:52.269
So let us welcome the Sun, coming to the North
now, this way.

00:17:52.269 --> 00:17:59.590
And for Australians to say that though the
sun has gone, let us establish the Sun, the

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:01.539
domain of Sun, within ourselves.

00:18:01.539 --> 00:18:04.519
Because Sun never disappears from our inside.

00:18:04.519 --> 00:18:10.100
So that is how we have to take a mood by which
we should think of one personality, all of

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.850
us together, all of us together.

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:19.200
And anybody who tries to be something separate
or different, he will drop out.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.620
I will drop him out.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.440
Whatever it may be, it will drop out.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:27.139
So you just don’t worry yourself, anybody
who tries to be singled out or anything.

00:18:27.139 --> 00:18:32.960
Everybody must do whatever they like, to nurture
the whole, to help the whole, to emancipate

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.100
the whole.

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.210
But not to, in anyway, put anyone down.

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:39.240
Always.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.659
Because this is not the way the Sahaja Yoga
is.

00:18:42.659 --> 00:18:44.190
Sahaja Yoga only works in collectivity.

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:49.489
And the one who has developed this permeating
spirit, is a real Sahaja Yogi.

00:18:49.489 --> 00:18:51.279
Who has not, is not!

00:18:51.279 --> 00:18:57.000
Whatever you may think of yourself, I have
nothing to say.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.690
But this permeating personality, which moves
from places to places, whether, you talk or

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:02.690
not.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:03.690
Like your Mother is.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:08.059
Whether I meet you or not, makes no difference,
but I am permeating through all of you, by

00:19:08.059 --> 00:19:11.139
little, little things, also, I am there with
you.

00:19:11.139 --> 00:19:14.919
So like that, try to permeate into each other
and see the beauty.

00:19:14.919 --> 00:19:19.269
And you’ll enjoy yourself the best because
that is the biggest thing.

00:19:19.269 --> 00:19:22.460
That's the biggest thing that is to be achieved.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:28.489
Because this ego you know makes you like a
nutshell and you just cannot have a rapport

00:19:28.489 --> 00:19:35.259
with that beauty of permeation and just see
how the notes move into each other.

00:19:35.259 --> 00:19:41.379
It will be a great idea today, it’s great
thing today [that] we are having Puja in Dhulia.

00:19:41.379 --> 00:19:43.760
Like the Dhulia means the dust, dust.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:49.610
And one day I had written in childhood, a
poem, I remember.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:54.310
Very interesting poem it was - I don't know
where it is now - but which said that I want

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:58.989
to be like a dust particle which moves with
the wind.

00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:01.179
It goes everywhere.

00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:07.260
Can go, sit on the head of a king, or can
go and fall at the feet of someone.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:13.630
And it can go and sit on a little flower,
and it can go and sit everywhere.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.149
But I want to be a particle of dust.

00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:21.289
That is fragrant, that is nourishing, that
is enlightening.

00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:27.250
Like that, I had written a very beautiful
poem, I must have been about seven years of

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:33.629
age, I remember - 'To be a dust particle',
I remember that very clearly, long time back,

00:20:33.629 --> 00:20:36.340
that I should be a dust particle.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.059
So that I’ll permeate into people.

00:20:40.059 --> 00:20:44.210
Which is a very big thing - to become a dust
particle of that kind.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:48.499
Whatever you touch, you see, that becomes
{sounds like ‘enwavened’ but I don’t

00:20:48.499 --> 00:20:54.539
think that’s a word – “enlightened”??},
whatever you just feel, that has fragrance.

00:20:54.539 --> 00:20:57.590
It’s such a great thing to be like that.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:01.419
And that was My desire, and it has been achieved.

00:21:01.419 --> 00:21:06.980
At that young age, I had this idea of becoming
a dust particle and today just while talking

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:13.639
to you, I remembered that I wanted to be that,
and that is what this place is.

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:15.119
And Raulbai is like that.

00:21:15.119 --> 00:21:21.669
She’s a very simple woman, very simple woman,
and she lives like a very simple person but

00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:23.499
she has a sense of permeation.

00:21:23.499 --> 00:21:27.580
And now there are so many Sahaja Yogis, yesterday
who came.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:30.169
I am sure that they will take up, Sahaja Yoga,
very well.

00:21:30.169 --> 00:21:37.940
And there are lots of Sahaja Yogis from Dhulia
now, and I am sure there are going to be more

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:38.940
people.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.059
I hope you have met all of them.

00:21:40.059 --> 00:21:41.539
Make friends with all of them.

00:21:41.539 --> 00:21:43.409
Try to know them who they are.

00:21:43.409 --> 00:21:46.049
They may not know English - so get somebody
to translate.

00:21:46.049 --> 00:21:49.700
Talk to them and be nice to them, be friendly
with them.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.210
I wanted you to meet them for permeation.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.859
You should know who are the people here, who
are in Nasik.

00:21:55.859 --> 00:22:00.440
Because somehow we never meet the Sahaja Yogis,
you see, who are in that particular place,

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.610
and when we go back we have only one or two
addresses.

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:04.210
It is not a good idea.

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:06.259
Try to see how many people there are.

00:22:06.259 --> 00:22:09.799
Ask questions about them, and all that.

00:22:09.799 --> 00:22:15.559
This permeation is only possible when your
ego starts permeating all around, and this

00:22:15.559 --> 00:22:22.279
is the way to overcome the problems of the
right side and that is how to worship Saraswati.

00:22:22.279 --> 00:22:27.750
Because Saraswati has a Veena in Her hand
and that Veena is the primordial instrument,

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:31.600
which She plays like music, and the smusic
penetrates into the heart.

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.791
You don't know how it goes into you and how
it works out.

00:22:35.791 --> 00:22:42.139
And that’'s how a person who is a Sahaja
Yogi should permeate - like music into other

00:22:42.139 --> 00:22:43.139
people.

00:22:43.139 --> 00:22:47.530
She has so many qualities, as I told you,
which cannot be described in one lecture.

00:22:47.530 --> 00:22:55.840
But one of the greatest qualities of Hers
is that She ends up into subtler things.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:59.249
Like the Mother Earth will end up into fragrance.

00:22:59.249 --> 00:23:08.359
Music will end up into melodies, like that
whatever She creates ends up into something

00:23:08.359 --> 00:23:09.359
greater.

00:23:09.359 --> 00:23:13.030
Matter, whatever She produces, ends up into
aesthetics.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:16.029
If matter does not have aesthetics then it
is gross.

00:23:16.029 --> 00:23:17.389
Like that everything.

00:23:17.389 --> 00:23:20.080
Now you will say what is water.

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:22.940
Water becomes the river Ganges.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.789
These are the subtler things.

00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:31.909
So the matter gets into subtler thing because
it has to permeate, it has to permeate.

00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:33.929
So everything whatever it is.

00:23:33.929 --> 00:23:38.169
And the best of all is the air.

00:23:38.169 --> 00:23:44.249
That air becomes the vibrations.

00:23:44.249 --> 00:23:50.419
So you can see how, whatever has come out
from this matter, from these five elements,

00:23:50.419 --> 00:23:52.779
becomes that subtle thing.

00:23:52.779 --> 00:23:59.429
Of course, the left and right side both work
it out because the love has to work on this

00:23:59.429 --> 00:24:09.090
and when love acts on matter it becomes that,
and that is how one has to look at your own

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:33.359
lives, to make it a beautiful combination

00:24:33.359 --> 00:24:59.659
of

00:24:59.659 --> 00:25:15.919
love
and matter.

00:25:15.919 --> 00:25:56.749
May God bless you!
