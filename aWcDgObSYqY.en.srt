1
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:25,310
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:33,580
At the very outset we have to understand that
truth is what it is. We cannot conceptualize

3
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:46,420
it. We cannot organize it. And we cannot use
it for our own purposes. Moreover, with the

4
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:59,010
blinkers on both the sides like a horse, with
all our conditionings, we cannot find the

5
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:08,380
truth. We have to be free people. We have
to be open-minded people, like scientists,

6
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:16,730
to see for ourselves what is the truth. If
somebody preaches something, professes something,

7
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:27,590
says something, is not to be accepted blindfolded.
As I told you yesterday, that the essence

8
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,840
of all the religions is to find the eternal
and to treat the transitory in its own understanding

9
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:49,459
and in its own limitations. That’s why we
have lost our balance. If we are really the

10
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:57,150
people who want to know the truth, we have
to know that at human awareness we cannot

11
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:10,609
know it. It becomes a concept.

12
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:17,609
You have to have the spiritual awareness,
but spiritual awareness is a state of your

13
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:26,190
being, where you become the spirit. Again
the word I’ll say – “become.” It’s

14
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,930
not artificially certifying somebody that
now you have become a Hindu or a Christian

15
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:40,930
or a Muslim, you become anything. Because
you may be a Muslim, Christian, Hindu, anything,

16
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:48,200
you can commit any sin. You can do anything
that is wrong. Nothing from inside is going

17
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:56,760
to stop you. So all these things have become
so much outward that now there are people

18
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:06,690
who have started saying there is no God, there
is nothing like religion, which is not true.

19
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:15,460
First of all when we say there is nothing,
or there is not God, we should find out, have

20
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:23,650
we been able to find out about it or just
in our ego we are saying there is no God?

21
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:32,890
Have we been able to work it out to see if
there is God or not? You do not judge God

22
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,370
by the people who talk about God. Anybody
can talk about God because they think there’s

23
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:46,500
no law that can catch them. They can talk
against Him, they can talk for Him, they can

24
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,690
do the way they like. They can even make money
by talking against God and against all the

25
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:58,690
prophets – that’s a very good way of making
money, blackmail. But does that mean that

26
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:06,550
whatever is written is a bible, or whatever
is black and white, is to be taken that seriously?

27
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:18,110
So first of all, we have to be little independent
to be free, to know that if you have to know

28
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:27,400
the spirit - as they said “know thyself”
- then you have to know it on your central

29
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:35,500
nervous system. As I can feel this is cold
or hot, you have to feel the divine power

30
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:50,090
which is all-pervading, which is the truth,
which manifests the truth, because it is the

31
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:59,300
love of God. You have to first feel it on
your central nervous system, which is the

32
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,330
bodha.

33
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:13,330
Now one may say that in the West we have advanced
so much, all right. We have gone too far with

34
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:24,470
everything. But if we see, when we started
with science, what have we produced? Hydrogen

35
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:34,060
bomb, atom bomb, all kinds of devils sitting
on our heads. You take to any enterprise that

36
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,400
we did, we go to extremes. There is no balance.
Any mental projection is linear, it moves

37
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,900
in one line and then recoils back, and then
you are shocked. Now you have got acid rain.

38
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:59,900
You produced machinery, all right. Machinery
is for you, you are not for machinery. And

39
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:09,479
thus, there is no balance between you and
the machinery, no balance between you and

40
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,360
the science. It is just like going amok with
anything that you get into your hand. And

41
00:08:18,449 --> 00:08:25,449
this balance you can only have when you become
the spirit. You see beautiful chandeliers

42
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:34,910
here, beautifully made, but unless and until
there is light what is the meaning of these

43
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:42,940
chandeliers? Nothing. In the same way, if
you do not have the light of the spirit shining

44
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:51,319
in your attention, you will not know your
meaning. Like this instrument – unless and

45
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:57,020
until it is connected to the mains, it is
useless. Unless and until we are connected

46
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:04,020
to the mains, we do not know the absolute,
and that’s why all these problems are there.

47
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:12,310
Now when I am talking about this instrument,
which lies within us, one has to again know

48
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,880
that this is the knowledge of the roots. And
to know the knowledge of the roots, you have

49
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:33,870
to become a subtler personality. With a gross
mind, you cannot see it. To become the subtler

50
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:41,870
personality, minimum of minimum, you have
to know that so far you have not known the

51
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:48,870
roots. If you had known, there would be no
problem. But there’s something has gone

52
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:57,040
wrong somewhere in every human enterprise,
even in religions, that’s why today we find

53
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:07,829
this kind of a farce going on. And what is
gone wrong is that we have to seek the eternal.

54
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:23,550
Maybe it might look a little different, for
example Buddha and Mahavira did not talk about

55
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:31,510
God at all. I also did not talk about God
for four years, at least three years. As soon

56
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:42,610
as you talk of God, again people start jumping,
“When can we become God?” – this is

57
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,300
the first question.

58
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:53,130
So first you become the self –the first
step. That’s why they did not talk. They

59
00:10:53,130 --> 00:11:00,130
said first you become yourself. Unless and
until you have your eyes, how can you see

60
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:07,779
the colors? So first have your eyes. It is
for your benevolence that you better get what

61
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:22,070
you deserve, what is your own. It’s your
birthright as a human being to become the

62
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:30,390
spirit. That is what Sahaja Yoga is – Saha
means “with” and ja is “born.” Born

63
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:37,390
with you is the right to get this yoga, is
the union with the Divine. It’s your birthright

64
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:50,370
as a human being. You are as I told you at
the epitome of evolution. And it has to work

65
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:59,810
out, but please open your hearts and open
your minds. Just open it and see for yourself,

66
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:07,510
it will work, I know. Yesterday it has worked.
It is going to work out today also. But by

67
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:14,510
thinking about it, you cannot conceptualize.
This is the biggest problem of our seeking

68
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:23,950
that we run after some sort of a concept.

69
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:31,260
Now here you have seen this instrument is
the most beautiful instrument that is created

70
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:38,420
within us during the process of our evolution.
The first one is the most beautiful one because

71
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,440
it stands for our innocence. This innocence
is the one which gives us real support, real

72
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,760
strength. And you’ll be surprised it is
never destroyed. It may be overshadowed, there

73
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:09,570
may be clouds. Maybe it may look to be a very
dark sky. Maybe a hopeless case. Some people

74
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:18,690
might say that we have destroyed our innocence.
It cannot be destroyed. Whatever you might

75
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:27,740
have done, this is one center which cannot
be destroyed. You may have problems with it

76
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,870
but it cannot be destroyed. It is such a wonderful
center you have got, which has got four petals,

77
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:41,870
which looks after the pelvic plexus, looks
after all the excretion within us.

78
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:51,050
In our own freedom, so-called, we do all kinds
of things which may not be benevolent for

79
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
ourselves, doesn’t matter. Kundalini cannot
be destroyed - the source which is going to

80
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:15,010
give you the self-realization, I say She is
your individual Mother. And this Mother is

81
00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:25,279
such a loving Mother and She knows each and
everything about you - from your past, from

82
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:32,279
your past lives - She knows you very well.
She is just waiting for a chance that She

83
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:40,810
can be awakened and She can give you your
second birth. When you were born, your mother

84
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,410
suffered for you – you did not suffer.

85
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:49,970
So to say that Kundalini awakening gives this
kind of a nonsense and that kind of a nonsense

86
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:56,970
is all falsehood. Absolutely falsehood. And
it is so absurd that how can a mother give

87
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:07,529
you problems? I mean, I don’t know about
some mothers are funny also – that’s all

88
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:14,649
human problems. But this is a Divine Mother.
She’s not going to give you trouble. But

89
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:23,649
these problems that have come are coming from
people who have no authority, who have no

90
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:29,070
education, who do not know what Kundalini
is. Some say it is in the stomach, some say

91
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:36,070
in the head, some say in the legs. Those who
have no character of their own, because they

92
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:43,430
have to be pure people themselves, try all
kinds of nonsensical tricks and create problems

93
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:51,970
on the sympathetic nervous system and they
call it as something that it is the problem

94
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:59,149
of the Kundalini. Kundalini will never give
you any problems. On the contrary, when She

95
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:06,709
rises and when you get your awakening, the
first thing that is established is thoughtless

96
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:07,410
awareness.

97
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:14,410
For when a thought rises, falls, another thought
rises, falls, and the Kundalini makes the

98
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:25,949
thoughts smaller and in between at the present.
It makes you stop in the present and you grow

99
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,740
in the present, and the thoughts, if you want
to think you can think, if you don’t want

100
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,670
to think, it is not like a madhouse going
on all the time, you don’t know how to stop

101
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:46,670
it. This works out with the Kundalini’s
awakening when She crosses this center of

102
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,259
ours, which we call as Agnya chakra.

103
00:16:54,259 --> 00:17:00,220
Now we should not have, again I say, blinkers
about Christ. Let us see what people have

104
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:07,220
to say about Christ in other shastras and
scriptures. Who was He? Because people did

105
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:17,510
not allow Him to manifest for more than four
years and in four years what can you do? You

106
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:24,550
cannot do anything. I must tell you in London
I came, My husband was selected for a job

107
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:31,919
and that’s how we are here, and for four
years I was struggling with seven of them,

108
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,840
just struggling. Giving realization was such
a difficult subject to the English people

109
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,840
at that time. They are hard nuts, I know.
But once they break, they are the best. I

110
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:53,790
think the best are the hardest. And it worked,
it clicked.

111
00:17:53,790 --> 00:18:00,790
I am surprised that I had to work very hard
but they are such a foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

112
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:07,980
Immediately they went all out and very scholarly
also – a lot of scholarship in them. Found

113
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:14,860
out all about Kundalini, everything from wherever
– your libraries are so well-equipped. And

114
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:21,860
I was surprised, it was all there. They studied
Sanskrit. Now can you imagine these people

115
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:30,240
English singing Sanskrit song with that speed?
They could not even say one sentence in Hindi

116
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:35,659
when they were in India. Three hundred years
they were there, they could not speak one

117
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:42,659
sentence you will be surprised. We had to
tell them in English how to speak Hindi. Like

118
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:49,880
you have to say “open the door” – is
in Hindi, is darwaja khol do. They couldn’t

119
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,480
say it. So we had to say, “there was a banker”
or something like that – means “close

120
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,880
the door” – “there was a banker.”
They couldn’t speak Hindi. Sanskrit is very

121
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,810
far off. And now look at them, what has happened
to them. And Indian music is such a difficult

122
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:13,899
music, you have to really, it is a question
of penance, tremendous penance. Now we have

123
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:20,230
people who play beautiful tabla, beautiful
instruments not only but sing so well. Swiss,

124
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:27,230
the hardest nuts you can ever think of, they
are - you’ll be amazed the Swiss the way

125
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:36,429
they sing, tremendous manifestation in such
a short time. Of course they can also sing

126
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:45,179
English very well, they know English music
very well, or should say Western music very

127
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:52,179
well. But to learn this difficult melodies
of India is remarkable. I am myself surprised

128
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,940
at this.

129
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:00,940
So what happens in the second center when
it enters, you just become dynamic, because

130
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:08,950
the second center is for aesthetics and for
creativity. Now we have, like My brother who

131
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:17,020
was a chartered accountant, he was very bad
at all the languages. Very bad, of course

132
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:24,520
Sanskrit was out of question. Now he is making
poetry in Sanskrit and in Urdu language and

133
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:30,510
also in Marathi, which is the most difficult
language. This is the second center. When

134
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:37,510
Kundalini nourishes that center, like a very
beautiful Mother she nourishes. You must have

135
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:44,909
heard about some great artists – Amjad Ali,
he was here – after realization he became

136
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:52,159
such a great artist. There are so many artists.
In India, they understand. They want to sing

137
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:58,190
before Me. I mean I don’t know how to say
that now only one person can sing. Because

138
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:05,190
their Kundalini goes up, and the creativity
becomes so tremendously active and so dynamic.

139
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:12,550
At the same time, that person becomes very
mild, very sweet, very compassionate. Like

140
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:21,340
there’s one great singer. She’s a Muslim
lady, I will not name her.

141
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,990
She wanted to sing and she sent Me word, “Please
allow me to sing in Your birthday.”

142
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,109
And I said, “All right, give her a chance.”

143
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:34,109
So she came down. And the lady who was playing
harmonium – she came and told Me, “This

144
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:41,580
lady is just an atom bomb, You don’t know
how she gets angry if there’s one note I

145
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,500
play wrong.”

146
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:49,359
I saw her but she was very silently playing
– nothing doing, she never got angry with

147
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:54,149
anyone. So in the interval, this lady comes
and tells Me, “That see in Your presence,

148
00:21:54,149 --> 00:22:01,149
I don’t know what has happened to this lady.
This tiger has become like a cow. How is it?”

149
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:06,270
I said, “See her Kundalini has come up.”

150
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:13,270
So this violence, this anger, this temper
is not your creation, it’s the creation

151
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:22,609
of your liver. Your liver is little out of
order because of many things, and the temper

152
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:32,090
is there. Now when the temper is too much,
you don’t know what to do. I mean you can

153
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:38,710
do whatever you like. In your temper after
all, it’s like a drunken personality. You

154
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:45,710
have to approach a person in a temper with
a barge pole. But all this temper, everything,

155
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:53,280
becomes so cool and so beautiful. It’s very
surprising. A very dynamic person becomes

156
00:22:54,419 --> 00:23:01,419
extremely compassionate, extremely compassionate,
and I’ve had such beautiful experiences

157
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:09,200
of their compassion that it’s not easy to
describe.

158
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:16,750
Now also they say that there are certain nationalities
which has got a trait like this and a trait

159
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:24,290
like that, everything dissolves. Everything
dissolves because of this center which is

160
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:33,190
so creative and which also gives you the manifestation
of pure knowledge - pure knowledge. For example

161
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:44,929
you start feeling on your finger tips – you
just start feeling on your finger tips. Like

162
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:52,889
today only, somebody came and told Me, “That
Mataji my Agnya is catching.” Agnya is this

163
00:23:53,550 --> 00:24:00,550
center - means “I’ve got my ego on.”
Will anybody say like that? On the contrary

164
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,760
if you tell somebody, “You have got your
ego,” they’ll show you that they have

165
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,970
their ego on. It’s very dangerous to say
to somebody that your ego is on. But just

166
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:16,849
because of self knowledge - pure knowledge
- you know that this Mr. Ego is sitting here

167
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:23,849
and I cannot cross through and there’s a
blockage here, which I have to take it out.

168
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,510
It’s so innate within you, everything, only
thing is your connection has to be made.

169
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:39,510
Once the connection is made, immediately you
know about yourself. And this center which

170
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:47,320
is responsible for creating all kinds of funny
thoughts and horrible creativity becomes so

171
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:54,580
benevolent, so soothing, so beautiful.

172
00:24:54,580 --> 00:25:01,580
Apart from that, as I told you just now, these
people who could not even say one word in

173
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,609
Hindi language have started singing Sanskrit
and this - specially the one they sang, the

174
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:16,609
first one - many Indians cannot sing that
way I can tell you, they can’t. It’s not

175
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:24,750
easy. It’s a very great tongue twister first
of all the language is. Apart from that, to

176
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:31,899
sing in such a correct pronunciation is so
difficult but they have done it. So in Sahaja

177
00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:42,879
Yoga, an artist who is struggling today may
become a great artist tomorrow. But still

178
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:48,950
I would say these are temptations. You’ll
become a great artist, you’ll start earning

179
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:55,040
more money, this, that…but that’s not
the one. You have to really be satisfied with,

180
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,460
you will never be satisfied with that.

181
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:05,460
So you move to the third center which we call
as the Nabhi chakra. This center is, on one

182
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:17,369
side, is made of water and another side with
fire. Around it are our ten valencies, which

183
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:27,320
we can call as our innate religion within
ourselves. Now this Nabhi itself - or we can

184
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:37,679
call the solar plexus or we can say the Navel
chakra - gives us, as soon as the Kundalini

185
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:50,619
rises, she awakens this and the light when
it spreads, you become religious. I don’t

186
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:57,490
have to tell you anything, you just become.
I don’t have to say that you don’t take

187
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:03,040
drugs. You just don’t take it. Overnight
I have seen people have given up drugs. Overnight,

188
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,580
alcoholism. Overnight, everything. And they
enjoy their virtues. That’s the best part

189
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:15,580
of it. Some people think, well then what is
the fun? What is this that you take something

190
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:23,919
in the pub and next day you have hangover.
Here you take something and next day you are

191
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:31,500
much better off. It never comes down. It never
gives you a reaction. It’s not artificial.

192
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:39,250
It’s not intoxicating. It is from your nerves
it’s bubbling out.

193
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:46,619
So this is the center which is very important
in us because most of us have a problem with

194
00:27:46,619 --> 00:27:53,619
this center. And here we have a capacity by
this center that we enjoy our generosity.

195
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:15,629
Now all matter whatever it is - we are materialistic,
materialistic, it is a good idea to be materialistic.

196
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:22,629
But the matter is, the aesthetics of matters
are, that you can give it to others suggesting

197
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:31,200
your love in it. I think that’s the only
thing the matter can do. And in a very special

198
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:39,980
way you can express that love. For example,
somebody likes a particular thing - you go

199
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:48,369
all the way to get it and give that small
thing, very small thing, to the person and

200
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:59,220
the joy, not out of the money that you have
spent, but the feelings you have expressed

201
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,480
of knowing what that person would love. And
this kind of a depth develops within you.

202
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:21,379
Such lovable beautiful society you enter into.
And you don’t need anything because everybody

203
00:29:25,589 --> 00:29:32,589
is looking after your needs. Now I have told
them I love flowers because I don’t take

204
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:37,119
anything else. So you must see whenever I
come My house is so filled with flowers that

205
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:41,490
My husband was saying, “Let us go live in
the garden and let the flowers be here.”

206
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:48,490
So you see the joy of giving, comes from this
center. And whatever you eat, whatever you

207
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:04,530
have to eat, whatever is good for you, you
eat. You don’t have to bother as to what

208
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,580
to eat, what not to eat – you just eat whatever
is good for you, benevolent for you. You become

209
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:17,580
so wise and also you please others. You don’t
displease others by saying, “This is bad

210
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:25,000
food, I want that.” ’I want’ goes away.
What do you want?

211
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,720
[speaks aside]

212
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:34,720
So the, like you could say a candle which
is not enlightened, is waiting to be enlightened,

213
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:44,659
is asking for the light – “I want light.”
But once it is enlightened, it gives light

214
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:51,780
to others, automatically - supposed to be.
In the same way you also start giving your

215
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:59,800
light, your love, your joy to others, automatically.
I don’t have to tell you. Nobody has to

216
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:08,429
go through any Ten Commandments anymore. Those
days are gone. Now automatically you become

217
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:15,429
like that - very beautiful people, very affectionate
and glorious, I should say. If you see the

218
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:31,270
glow on the face of Sahaja Yogis, the face
itself is radiant. Many people drop out their

219
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:40,409
ten years to twenty years in their age and
they are so enthusiastic, never get tired,

220
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:48,879
especially in England I’ve seen – or also
in the West I would say everywhere – people

221
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:50,690
get very really tired.

222
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:55,940
On the television also you find people will
come and sit down “huh…” Young people,

223
00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:02,940
they’ll talk ten times, they’ll say “huh…
Why are we so tired?” Because we think too

224
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:15,139
much. All energy is wasted in thinking, so
no energy left to enjoy anything whatsoever.

225
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:22,300
For example, you have to have people for dinner,
they think what to bring, how to make it formal,

226
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:28,310
what to do, this thing, that thing, so agitated
and so nervous about the whole thing – when

227
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:35,099
the guests come in, they feel like running
away. Because so much of tension of thinking,

228
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:41,240
thinking, thinking….. Planning, planning,
planning, planning, planning… Ultimately

229
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,599
the whole joy has disappeared.

230
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:51,599
So the second center which is there, it does
a very miraculous thing, is to provide the

231
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:02,129
grey cells in our brain, when we are using
it for thinking, and also it looks after your

232
00:33:02,129 --> 00:33:09,129
liver, your pancreas, your spleen, your kidneys
and lower part of your abdomen. Instead of

233
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:19,899
doing that, poor thing is busy only sending
grey cells to your brain because thinking,

234
00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:26,899
thinking, thinking, thinking, like mad. So
you develop all other diseases – liver trouble,

235
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:34,200
which is very common. Then you develop diabetes
– very common. Yesterday at least there

236
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:44,169
were ten people who said we have diabetes.
Now diabetes you do not develop by taking

237
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:50,329
too much sugar – take it from Me. In India
if you go to a village, you’ll see that

238
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:56,300
he takes sugar in such a manner that in the
cup the spoon must stand at right angles,

239
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:03,300
otherwise he won’t take it. But he never
gets diabetes. The reason is he doesn’t

240
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:10,669
think of tomorrow - he just works hard, eats
his food and sleeps off, nicely. He doesn’t

241
00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:17,669
take sleeping pills either. So this diabetes
comes by over-thinking and can be easily cured

242
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:25,099
if you can take to Sahaja Yoga, which I’ll
tell you how we’ll stop our thinking at

243
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:30,139
this, I’ve already told you, at this point.

244
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:35,210
Then the third disease which is even more
dangerous than this, is the disease which

245
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:42,210
we call as blood cancer. Blood cancer is caused
only to people who think too much. It can

246
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:50,040
even be to the children if the mother is very
meticulous, particular about her carpets or

247
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,839
her house, everything you know and even a
rat doesn’t enter that house. But she is

248
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:59,970
very careful that all her things are properly
done, her sink doesn’t have even so much

249
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:06,970
of, little bit of a spot left in it. All the
time, thinking, planning, thinking, planning.

250
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:17,920
This affects the child and a child also can
get blood cancer. Blood cancer you get it

251
00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:26,089
because your spleen is a speedometer- is the
one which gives you the rhythm of life, rhythm

252
00:35:26,089 --> 00:35:33,089
of life. Now when we are hectic people, all
the time under shock, then this goes out of

253
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,990
order.

254
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:45,990
For example in the morning we get up and see
the newspaper and what you find, these Iranians

255
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:56,700
have killed someone – such a shock. Then
an accident, then… I mean newspaper will

256
00:35:57,579 --> 00:36:04,450
never give good news, will they? Will they
give news, how many people got realization

257
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:10,990
or something is working out all, all right?
No something horrible that should shock your

258
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:17,990
heads, shock your limbic area – otherwise
you’ll not take it seriously. So, once you

259
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:24,920
read that, you don’t know your system is
a very delicate system, it gets a shock. And

260
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,970
then you get into your car, without taking
your breakfast, or maybe in your hand is the

261
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:33,900
breakfast because you are late. On the way
there is a jam – you are shouting, screaming

262
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:40,900
- somehow or other you reach the office and
there is the boss barking.

263
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:49,600
This is how we live, under complete tension.
We are supposed to be free people. In the

264
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:57,050
night if you sing loudly the neighbor will
come and put you to the police station. I

265
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:04,390
mean you can’t do anything. There’s no
freedom. You have to be bound by the watch.

266
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:11,840
This is the time, exact you have to reach
there. So all these things, pressures, and

267
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:18,840
all these things work on us and we become
hectic. And for emergency, this spleen is

268
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:28,520
the one which releases red blood corpuscles
– RBCs. But if you are all the time like

269
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:35,870
this hectic, that poor spleen becomes mad.
It doesn’t know what to do. It starts producing

270
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:45,120
more cells, more cells and then it thinks
it’s a mad person I am fixed with because

271
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,580
I don’t know when to act, when not to act.

272
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:52,250
So the vulnerability is there, and suddenly
with some other shock, you might get blood

273
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:58,600
cancer and then the doctors will certify you
are going to die after one month. Finished,

274
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:05,600
prepare for your burial. And the whole house
is crying. But we have cured, I mean Sahaja

275
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:17,450
Yoga has cured blood cancer of many people
just by this Kundalini awakening because as

276
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:28,810
soon as the Kundalini is awakened, too much
movement this side and that side, this all

277
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:33,520
the time going on, in the center – this
is the left and the right side of the sympathetic

278
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:40,520
– so just the Kundalini passes through,
strings through and brings it back and nourishes

279
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:50,590
it. The problem is over. And though they were
certified to be dead, after even four years

280
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:58,800
they are all right, working all right, the
certificate is cancelled. Even vulnerability

281
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:11,540
to cancer, or to all incurable diseases, are
because of these centers going out of place.

282
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:24,550
Now we have the center which we call here
as the heart center. It controls the left

283
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:32,890
and right, both – so we have a left and
right heart in Sahaja Yoga. As you know that,

284
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:45,220
this sternum bone creates the antibodies for
you. And these antibodies fight your diseases.

285
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:56,740
So when this center goes out, this is the
center which sends all the messages to these

286
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:07,350
antibodies. Now this is the center of a mother.
When your motherhood is challenged, you develop

287
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,290
breast cancer.

288
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:22,290
Supposing a man is a flirt and his wife is
worried, she might get a breast cancer, because

289
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:30,870
her motherhood is challenged and her sense
of security is very disturbed. As a result

290
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:44,600
of that, she gets this problem. Also if you
are too much of a thinker, and you think too

291
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:54,040
much and you’re very, what we call the right-sided,
the futuristic planner, I mean people plan

292
00:40:54,040 --> 00:41:01,040
it for ten years. They plan even their deaths,
what dress they are going to wear and where

293
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:08,670
they are going to be buried, up to that point.
All this futuristic planning creates such

294
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:18,250
tremendous heat in the body because the liver,
which is supposed to absorb all the heat,

295
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:26,310
is neglected by this center. As a result that
heat travels up and you develop asthma. Now

296
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:35,250
we had yesterday, at least five or six people
who came with asthma. Asthma is absolutely

297
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:43,980
curable. But do you know this is the center
of a husband, or of the father. Now if I am

298
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,980
telling you, you should not be shocked, because
later on you’ll find it.

299
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:54,980
Now if you are a bad husband, you can get
asthma. Or if your wife is a shrew, you might

300
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:02,700
get an asthma. Or if you are a very bad father,
you might get an asthma. Or if your father

301
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:12,330
is not kind to you, you might get an asthma.
If you have not forgiven your father, you

302
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:19,020
might get asthma. Now can you believe it,
just forgiving your father, you can get out

303
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:26,020
of your asthma permanently. Sahaja Yoga has
cured asthma of so many people. Believe it

304
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:33,650
or not, it works. It looks so funny but our
relationships, our parents we have chosen

305
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:44,460
when we came on this Earth. I know they are
wrong, they are obstinate, they’re headstrong,

306
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:50,270
they may be drunkards, whatever they are.
But even if you leave them, because so many

307
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:56,120
people leave the parents, still forgive them
and forget. Otherwise you carry the problems

308
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,370
with you.

309
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:03,280
The left heart is the place of the mother.
Now if your mother has been hard with you,

310
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:13,940
if you have had very bad experiences, you
will have problems of the left heart. Center

311
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:19,110
heart is very important where your sense of
security should be established. You’ll be

312
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:25,160
surprised in the disease called AIDS, it is
the center heart which is out. We have tried

313
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:31,910
to cure, and we cured also 3, 4 people from
AIDS, but they have no will-power to continue

314
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:38,300
with Sahaja Yoga, they want to die. And they
have made a big martyrdom out of it, you see

315
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:44,610
they are martyrs, great martyrs of a great
principle they have established. It’s impossible

316
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:50,240
to convince to them, that this is unnatural
that you are doing and that you should give

317
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:56,390
it up and you should live, why should you
die? No, we are martyrs for such a big principle

318
00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:03,390
we have established. To do something out of
the way and new is the modern fashion. Anything

319
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:10,770
- will do something with the hair, with the
nose, with the eyes, with the ears, with the

320
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:18,990
clothes. That’s all you can do. To such
an extent that they do not realize that whatever

321
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:23,850
is new may not be good for you.

322
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:29,050
For example, everyday we eat our dinner. Supposing
we want to eat the table because it is new

323
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:36,050
– is it a sensible thing? Anything that
is new, is not good. But anything that is

324
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:44,200
old, may not be good also. So you have to
have that wisdom which comes to you through

325
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:50,150
Sahaja Yoga. There is no other way out - you
have to become the spirit, and you have to

326
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:54,430
see in the light of the spirit, what is right
and what is wrong.

327
00:44:54,430 --> 00:45:01,430
So then wecome to this center which is, we
call as the Vishuddhi – this has sixteen

328
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:08,820
petals, looks after the cervical plexus. Now
this is a very very important center and this

329
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:15,240
is the center is for communication. For example,
when you talk, you communicate through your

330
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:20,570
hands. You shake hands, you touch somebody,
and you can communicate. Even if you cannot

331
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:27,570
talk, with your hands you can communicate.
Also when we think we are very responsible,

332
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:37,620
this center goes out. Like some people were
traveling by plane - they were from villages,

333
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:45,190
they did not know what was a plane. They were
told to take less luggage because it should

334
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:51,040
not be a weight for the plane. So they got
into the plane and put all of the luggage

335
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:58,040
on their heads. And they said that “We are
trying to reduce the weight of the plane.”

336
00:45:58,250 --> 00:46:05,250
In the same way, we are also... actually the
One - which is all-pervading power, which

337
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,210
has created us, created this universe and
has brought us to this level of human beings

338
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:17,210
- is doing everything. But we think we are
responsible, we have to do it. But once you

339
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:24,370
become a Sahaja Yogi you just do it, no doubt.
But you don’t think that you are doing anything.

340
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:30,660
You just say its happening. And what a beautiful
feeling it is. Then you don’t have blood

341
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:37,660
pressures, you don’t have headaches, you
don’t have tensions – no, because we are

342
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:45,290
not doing it. It is just done and you find
it’s all done.

343
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:53,090
Now on this center when we come, as I’ve
told you, your thinking is controlled by you,

344
00:46:54,300 --> 00:47:00,520
you can control. If you want you can think
or you don’t think. But in that silence

345
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:07,520
you feel your peace. If there’s too much
of crowds, too much of problems, suddenly

346
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:15,730
you become the witness. You start seeing everything.
Seeing the problem, what it is. Unless and

347
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:23,760
until you can see the problem you cannot solve
it. Because you are in the problem, you just

348
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:29,880
get upset. But if you are out of the problem,
you can see it. And that’s what happens

349
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:36,880
to you when you become thoughtlessly aware
when this center opens out.

350
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:44,140
Last but not the least is the center of limbic
area which is very important. Now I do not

351
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:53,130
know it has been discovered or not, but it
will be very soon discovered, that very strong

352
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:59,790
things like cracks and all that have got sulfuric
acid in it, and that doesn’t go anywhere

353
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:06,790
in the body, just rushes into the limbic area.
Now this limbic area is a hollow place which

354
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:14,570
has got all cells here very sensitive to joy
and happiness. But they become numb, so numb

355
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:22,490
that ordinary music you cannot hear - somebody
has to scream at you, has to shout at you,

356
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:28,620
he has to jump on it, otherwise you cannot
enjoy. Then it has to be worse and worse and

357
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:35,060
worse and worse… I don’t know now with
cracks, later on they might develop something

358
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:42,060
even more poisonous, because it has to excite
this limbic area which is such an important

359
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:49,800
thing. But as soon as the Kundalini enters
into that area, limbic area, she soothes it

360
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:58,420
and it opens - opens like a lotus, thousand
petalled lotus. It opens and then the Kundalini

361
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:12,000
emerges out of your fontanelle bone area and
gets connected to the all-pervading power.

362
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:18,950
Then you start feeling the cool breeze in
your hands. You can feel it all over. Some

363
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:24,580
people in the beginning who felt cool breeze,
could not believe it – so they closed doors,

364
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:31,270
everything and sat down to see, still they
were feeling it. But it works, works in the

365
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:38,270
sense that you get empowered. You become peaceful,
you become the witness, you become the wise

366
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:47,550
and you become empowered that you can give
realizations to others like this, that you

367
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:54,550
can raise the Kundalini like this and you
can establish that connection. You can do

368
00:49:55,570 --> 00:50:02,570
it. And this is what is your right to have
it. This is what will give you meaning. Otherwise

369
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:09,600
so far whatever we have been doing is very
frustrating.

370
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:15,050
Now yesterday I said some questions can be
asked but I haven’t seen any questions whatsoever.

371
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:22,050
That means you have no questions? Or there
are some questions we can deal with it for

372
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:55,570
about 5 minutes. There’s one there, please..

373
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:08,110
Question: INAUDIBLE, but someone else (a yogi
near Mother?) repeats the question:

374
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:27,420
[What is the process by which you one stops
thinking?]

375
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:34,420
It’s very simple. When the Kundalini settles
down there, what happens, as I told you, there

376
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:42,950
is Christ – Christ is awakened and He sucks
in these two institutions which you see there,

377
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:50,119
the yellow and the blue. These are – one
is, the blue one is our conditioning and the

378
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:57,380
yellow one is our ego. So both these are sucked
in like that. These are sucked in because

379
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:05,790
it is said that He died for our sins, didn’t
He? He suffered for us. Now also that’s

380
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:12,720
why yesterday I’ve said are we going to
suffer more than Him? We don’t have to suffer.

381
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:19,720
Only awaken Him at Agnya. We are all right,
this is the process, it opens out. All right?

382
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:28,290
That’s why I said you must forgive, because
He said you have to forgive and when you forgive

383
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:32,490
you can ask for forgiveness, that’s why
we do both the things – one in the front

384
00:52:32,490 --> 00:52:38,380
and one in the back.

385
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:39,670
Please get up.

386
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:45,480
[How do you raise the Kundalini?]

387
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,820
Automatically, I’ll tell you how. Please,
you see like if you have to sprout a seed

388
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:55,150
you have to just put it in the Mother Earth.
How do you do it? The Mother Earth has got

389
00:52:55,150 --> 00:53:02,150
the capacity and the seed is built-in within
it. Now it is all built-in within you, all

390
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:08,880
right. And just you are here, I can raise
it – anybody can raise it, those who have

391
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,840
got the capacity – Sahaja Yogis can raise
your Kundalini also.

392
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:20,840
[Question from the floor, : You talk about
always thinking. You talk about, like, if

393
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:28,960
you think too much, you can actually create
illness and the problems in your life. How

394
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:38,950
do You organize Your time and Your work and
everything, but You don’t think about it?]

395
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:45,050
Oh, because the Divine Power does for Me.
Everything is done by Divine Power. Why should

396
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:52,050
I think – let it think for Me. You see I
travel every day – I sleep at 2 o’clock

397
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:06,030
in the night, get up about 5 o’clock in
the morning and I travel everywhere. And I’m

398
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:12,900
now 67 years of age, all right, so what. Divine
Power is looking after Me, it’s working

399
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:19,900
out everything. I am just moving about nicely
enjoying everything.

400
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:30,180
But you have to believe that you can get realization.
You need not believe in the Divine Power,

401
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:41,880
but you just first believe that you can get
realization and you get it and get in connection

402
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,000
with it. It just works. It is the subtlest
of subtle.

403
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:53,000
[Yogi, repeating the question: How can we
utilize the divine power in our relationships

404
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,500
and all the problems?]

405
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:05,500
You see first of all you have to give to others.
Unless and until you open one door, all right

406
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:12,570
that’s Divine Power there. But unless and
until you open other door, it won’t come

407
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:18,490
in your life. So you have to open the other
door also. There’s where we fail, we want

408
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:25,490
to use Sahaja Yoga for our own purpose, for
our own – my brother, my sister, my son,

409
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:32,740
all sorts of my, my, my… There there’s
problem – but open it out. Everything works

410
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:42,550
out. You must learn to give. This is free.

411
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:53,130
[Question inaudible]

412
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:58,350
It is situated on top of the brain where it
is above the brain, and it is covered with,

413
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:05,350
the doctors say that it is 988 nerves - because
I don’t want to quarrel with them. But there

414
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:16,100
are 1000 nerves which cover it. And when it
is enlightened you’ll be surprised, you’ll

415
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:23,100
see a beautiful lotus opening in all colors,
very very silent flames, and they are so peace-giving,

416
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:38,010
looks so beautiful. Because when any nerve
gets enlightened, the light of that flame

417
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:50,060
looks like a petal. It’s very beautiful,
it is. But it has to open out. Just now it

418
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:57,109
is covered by our conditioning and our ego.
Like we have become like an egg we can say.

419
00:56:57,109 --> 00:57:02,170
That’s why in Sanskrit language, a person
who has known the brahma, the all-pervading

420
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:09,170
power, is called as dvijaha and a bird is
also called as dvijaha - means born twice.

421
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:19,990
First as an egg, then it becomes a bird – human
being and a realized soul. These are the two

422
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:26,690
stages.

423
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:29,260
[Question inaudible]

424
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:36,260
You see the thing is that now there are social
conditions which are very bad, people are

425
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:43,170
homeless, they are on the streets. Now thinking
about it you are not going to help them, are

426
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:50,030
you? No. Which is the best way is to empower
yourself, all right? Now see for example,

427
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:57,030
in the villages of India where I work, people
have given them alcohol, they have given up

428
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:07,030
all bad habits, they have become very dynamic,
they have become very well off, they are living

429
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:14,050
very well. In London, if you want to work,
I am sure you can get a home, no problem.

430
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:21,850
You see the Asians who have come here, I am
an Asian though I didn’t come as an immigrant,

431
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:28,850
they are becoming very rich, because they
work very hard, very hard, so those who want

432
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:34,730
to… in London. But in India it may not be.
But despite that, after Sahaja Yoga they have

433
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:41,050
improved so much – they have become so dynamic,
they have become so hopeful of life. But if

434
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:48,050
you just think that life is good for nothing,
let us now drink and be merry then it won’t

435
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,359
work out.

436
00:59:50,359 --> 00:59:55,200
These homeless and all these conditions are
all such – because it is an artificial condition

437
00:59:55,200 --> 01:00:02,200
you know, many people have houses but they
don’t want to give it for people to live.

438
01:00:02,350 --> 01:00:09,350
Now if those people get transformation, they
won’t behave like that. You see the whole

439
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:14,980
behavior will change when the emancipation
of the society comes up. But I have seen in

440
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:21,980
the villages of India there’s a complete
transformation. The social conditions are

441
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:29,340
much worse but Indians are more satisfied
people, they are not so much. Here even, supposing

442
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:34,960
you offer a house, they will say, “No, I
don’t like this house.” You offer a job,

443
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,980
they’ll say, “I don’t want this job.”
All these things are there – also too much

444
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:45,980
of choices. But if you decide, London is not
difficult place I tell you to work hard and

445
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:53,350
get a house, not difficult, they can do it.
But people don’t work here, don’t work.

446
01:00:54,690 --> 01:01:00,410
There are so many old people who haven’t
got anybody to help them. But these people

447
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:07,090
will never go and help them. They can earn.
This is a place where anybody can earn I think,

448
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:12,180
because I know people, Asians, who have come
here without any money are very rich today

449
01:01:12,180 --> 01:01:18,780
- all have got big big cars, nice houses,
this, that. You can see that they are very

450
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:19,230
hardworking.

451
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:24,970
And then divorces, everybody third day if
you divorce someone what will happen to you?

452
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:29,700
You’ll end up without a home. No respect
for the wife, the wife has no respect for

453
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:36,700
the house. All upside down society. There’s
a big quarrel going on between husband and

454
01:01:36,910 --> 01:01:42,200
wife – how can you have a home with this
husband and wife fighting? Even TV if you

455
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:47,800
open, nothing but fighting - you just don’t
want to hear anyone. See we had to decide

456
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:54,080
on certain things – that if we have to make
a home, then we have to understand our role

457
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:54,920
in life.

458
01:01:54,920 --> 01:02:01,920
For a woman and a man, I agree, they are equal,
no doubt. But they are like two wheels of

459
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:09,990
a chariot which has some distance but they
are not similar. And no use fighting with

460
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:14,650
each other – when you can’t live without
each other, why should you fight? And the

461
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:21,650
children are on the streets. Every child I
find 18 years of age is out of the house.

462
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:28,540
I mean here the little children are killed
– why? In India, I cannot think of such

463
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:35,540
a thing. The reason, though they are very
poor, the reason is they know what is love.

464
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:43,609
And that is what I feel that the society has
to little bit take to Sahaja Yoga.

465
01:02:43,609 --> 01:02:50,430
Now we have so many marriages in Sahaja Yoga
– I mean 1% marriages fail, 1%. They have

466
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:55,350
beautiful children, they are living very well,
they have good houses. Those who were really

467
01:02:55,350 --> 01:03:02,350
hippies had nothing, are having nice houses
and everything they have. Also some of them,

468
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:10,310
were “Oh, so I am now fortunately, I am
without job.” And I said, “What, you are

469
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:17,180
very fortunate?” “Yea, now I am without
job. Very happy about it.” So I told the

470
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:24,180
gentleman that if you are not going to stick
to one job, you are not going to come to Sahaja

471
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:31,840
Yoga. And that fellow today has a big car,
a nice wife, children and a house.

472
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:41,770
So all these ideas of stupid freedom must
be given up. One has to come to a balance

473
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:53,119
and value your life. You must value it. Human
life is very valuable. With what great difficulty

474
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:01,960
God has created you and what are we doing
with it? The whole society has to take a turn

475
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:20,780
and think of living happily – if the husband
and wife, I mean such a relationship, husband

476
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:29,500
and wife cannot live together, then how do
we expect this world to have United Nations?

477
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,920
We cannot – it is falsehood.

478
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:40,920
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t have divorces – we
have sometimes, sometimes we have, is allowed.

479
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:53,070
But that is mostly when they are married beforehand
– fallen in love, now they are rising in

480
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:56,869
love, falling in love again, again falling,
rising in love again… how many times they

481
01:04:56,869 --> 01:05:03,869
fall in love God only knows. It’s a funny
stuff going on. We have to face the reality.

482
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:14,369
So just worrying about these things, what
we should do, is to first of all become wise

483
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:21,369
and understand the problems. We can all solve
it. It is very simple, it is very simple to

484
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:24,830
solve the problems.

485
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:31,830
First of all we have to enter into the Kingdom
of God. And secondly, that it solves your

486
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:42,599
problems. Just worrying about poor people,
it’s also a kind of a fashion these days.

487
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:47,470
Because when I went to Switzerland, I met
a lady. She said, “I am very guilty.”

488
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:48,460
I said, “Why?”

489
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:49,210
“Because of Afghanistan.”

490
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:50,359
I said, “Are you Afghani?”

491
01:05:50,359 --> 01:05:53,160
“No, but I am guilty about Afghanistan.”

492
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:57,500
“What have you got to do with Afghanistan?”

493
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,040
“Nothing.”

494
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:05,040
So it’s kind of an idea - what are we doing
about it? But a Sahaja Yogi does, Sahaja Yogi

495
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:15,080
finds out ways and methods of creating a convenient
life – a life where you can earn, you can

496
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:28,560
live… we do it – we have done, I have
so many examples. Because it’s a collective

497
01:06:31,410 --> 01:06:38,240
life also you help each other. We didn’t
have rich people in Sahaja Yoga many because

498
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:43,099
they seldom come to Sahaja Yoga. They go to
false gurus because they can purchase the

499
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:50,099
guru – they can’t purchase Me. So mostly
the rich never come here. Bureaucrats also

500
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:56,700
don’t come, politicians don’t come. So
those people who come to Me are the people

501
01:06:56,700 --> 01:07:03,700
who can easily solve the problem because they
are so collective, they can solve the problem.

502
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:14,810
You’ll be surprised, I went to Turkey – My
husband was not so for it – everybody said,

503
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:23,050
“That’s a Muslim country, this, that.”
I went to a Muslim country that was Turkey,

504
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:30,050
and a woman, I just said I must go. But I
was surprised, they worshipped Mother, they

505
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,930
worshipped their mothers. And they were so
beautiful – so many. In one shot, we got

506
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:44,930
70 people – serious Sahaja Yogis. But do
you know when I reached there, people from

507
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:52,450
America, from Australia, from all over the
world arrived there in Turkey to help Me.

508
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:58,920
I mean I was so enamored to see My children
coming, arriving there on their own - those

509
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:05,920
who could afford it. And the Turkish people
were so beautiful, I tell you. I found they

510
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:09,000
are the same everywhere.

511
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:16,000
There’s only a skin deep difference, I tell
you, otherwise we are just the same. So all

512
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:25,000
these problems can be easily solved – there’s
nothing so serious about it. There is 

513
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:07,650
a very great thing no doubt, but unless and
until you are connected, it is like telephoning

514
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:23,270
without connection. There are people in India
who’ll go on saying “Rama Rama Rama Rama

515
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:33,210
Rama” like that. And the chakra of Rama
itself will be caught. They’ll be saying

516
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:39,540
“Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva” and the heart
chakra, where Shiva resides, it will be caught.

517
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:46,540
The reason is, supposing you want to meet
the Queen – now if you go to Buckingham

518
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:55,810
Palace and go on saying “Elizabeth, Elizabeth,
Elizabeth” – you’ll be arrested! And

519
01:09:55,810 --> 01:10:02,810
you’ll end up in a jail!

520
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:12,400
So you must have some connection, there should
be some protocol. Now if it is for kings and

521
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:25,050
prime ministers, what about God? He’s not
in your pocket. But once you are realized,

522
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:34,020
even once you take the name, it is sufficient.
What is there? He’s at your disposal all

523
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:41,020
the time there. But you have to have connection.
Now you are the citizens say of England, or

524
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:46,570
some place, all right so your government is
looking after you. Whether you are satisfied

525
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:51,980
or not is not the point. But they are looking
after you. But if you enter into the Kingdom

526
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:58,980
of God, then see the efficiency of this Kingdom.
You’ll be amazed if I tell you how things

527
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:09,980
work out. So amazing 

528
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:48,920
it is, so amazing. See first of all they say
Kundalini has to rise. Then it sometimes comes

529
01:11:55,690 --> 01:12:02,690
back to the centers which are needing more
help. So it is like a rope you can say, which

530
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:10,400
has many strings in it, very thin ones just
like a hair, and one by one they open out.

531
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:20,780
So first, very few of them pierce through,
open out the Sahasrara, by which you relax

532
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:29,500
and the chakras open out more. It goes on
like that. But once you are connected properly

533
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:38,040
then there’s no problem. But it is instantaneous,
no doubt about it. But for that you have to

534
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:49,110
come to our centers, don’t have to pay anything,
just spend some time and you have to master

535
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:52,950
it, that’s all.

536
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:59,950
There’s a question, what purpose do we have
on this planet?

537
01:13:01,469 --> 01:13:08,469
The purpose of our existence is to prove that
God’s creation is the most successful thing.

538
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:20,320
That’s the purpose.

539
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:27,320
About Me, I will not talk - I am sorry. You
better get your realization and try to find

540
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:50,020
out about Me, because those who have talked
- you see human beings are mad people, you

541
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:56,540
don’t know. Christ said “I am the Son
of God” – which He was no doubt. And He

542
01:13:56,540 --> 01:14:02,670
saidthat, “I am the door” – which He
was, no doubt. But they crucified Him. They

543
01:14:02,670 --> 01:14:09,540
gave poison to Mohammed Sahib. They killed
so many saints. I know human beings very well,

544
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:15,639
so please I am not going to talk to you about
Myself at all. You better get your self-realization

545
01:14:15,639 --> 01:14:22,639
- try to know Me. Because I have to do some
jobs, all right and for that, I want to live.

546
01:14:27,739 --> 01:14:34,739
People are really sometimes so funny. Even
otherwise they behave in such a funny manner

547
01:14:35,130 --> 01:14:41,460
that I can’t understand. As if I am going
to take away their property or something.

548
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:48,460
I am here to give you something that is very
important. Sort of you can say I am here to

549
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:56,750
complete the work of Christ, Mohammed and
all of them.

550
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:15,940
Yes please…. When you will give to others,
you will receive the blessings. That’s what

551
01:15:37,830 --> 01:15:44,830
it is absolutely 100%. He said so many things.
I mean just explaining Sahaja Yoga throughout

552
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:51,070
I think.

553
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:58,070
[Question inaudible]

554
01:16:01,860 --> 01:16:08,860
That 

555
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:21,000
should not be the question just now, all right.
Because to say anything about it, you know

556
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:28,000
what happens with people. So this can be discussed
later on, when we get our self-realization.

557
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:37,070
Certain things at a level can be discussed
and this is what happened with all of them

558
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:44,410
because they had very little time to talk
to you. And that’s why everything has been

559
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:51,920
misinterpreted, misused, because to understand
the truth, to bear it also, one has to have

560
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:04,760
self-realization. This I have found out. If
you are not a self realized person you can’t

561
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:12,290
bear the truth, you cannot – it’s too
much for human mind to grasp and to allow

562
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:21,210
it to be a part and parcel of their understanding.
Truth is too much for them.

563
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:29,620
So the first thing should be that we get our
self-realization. Yes, my child…

564
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:31,420
[Initial question inaudible.

565
01:17:31,420 --> 01:17:37,060
Mother: Can you get up, please?

566
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:43,590
Questioner: Yes, of course

567
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:48,489
Mother: Thank you.

568
01:17:48,489 --> 01:17:55,489
Questioner: Do the colors of the chakras change
all the time?[… INAUDIBLE]

569
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:08,550
But the auras you see sometimes are these
colors only. But sometimes you are more strong

570
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:15,550
with one center, so that color shows. They
do not change, they are just the same.

571
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:22,940
All right I think now it is 10 o’clock so
we’ll take about 10 minutes more and let

572
01:18:22,940 --> 01:18:29,810
us finish with our self-realization which
is going to take only 10 minutes. Those who

573
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:36,680
do not want to have should please leave, they
should not sit here and just watch other people.

574
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:43,160
That’s the only kindness I request of them
– that if you do not want to have self-realization,

575
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:49,790
it’s better that you should leave. Those
people who are standing, could not get place,

576
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:56,790
can come here or you can also give them places
if you want to give some places. No, not for

577
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:02,620
Sahaja Yogis, I said for others – for others,
for outsiders, Sahaja Yogis can stand up.

578
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:09,620
At the very outset you have to now understand
that we are going to enter into the Kingdom

579
01:19:45,739 --> 01:19:52,739
of God and hence we have to little bit unload
ourselves. One of the conditions is that we

580
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:11,290
should not feel guilty – one should not
feel guilty at all. Yesterday, same problem

581
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:17,450
I said, but you were still feeling guilty.
Also it’s a fashion. Also I think the language

582
01:20:17,450 --> 01:20:22,350
is such – all the time sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry… Even when we used to receive telephones

583
01:20:22,350 --> 01:20:26,950
we used to say “I beg your pardon.” But
now it is sorry, sorry, sorry – ten times

584
01:20:26,950 --> 01:20:33,000
sorry. What is there to be so sorry?

585
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,250
So we have to be pleasantly placed towards
ourselves. We have to respect ourselves. We

586
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:45,250
have to be happy about ourselves. This is
first thing is not to feel guilty about anything

587
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:52,690
- just believe that you have done nothing
wrong which cannot be dissolved by this great

588
01:20:53,930 --> 01:21:00,930
power of forgiveness. Please believe Me. But
if you want to stick onto a feeling like that

589
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:08,980
– “No, no, I am guilty” – it’s only
mental. Animals don’t feel guilty about

590
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:16,480
anything – a dog will bark, tiger will eat
anything that it wants to. It’s only human

591
01:21:16,690 --> 01:21:22,440
beings who feel that way – that I’ve done
this wrong, I’ve done that wrong. All right,

592
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:26,400
so not to feel guilty that’s one point.

593
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:33,400
The second one is to forgive everyone, which
is very difficult for many people. I don’t

594
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:45,670
know how many mounds of unhappiness is in
the head because we cannot forgive. Mounds,

595
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:53,020
it’s not kilos and kilos. Yesterday I found
most of them had not forgiven and I had to

596
01:21:56,730 --> 01:22:03,730
go on putting balm on their heads to take
out. So you must cooperate. Just forgive,

597
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:11,239
just forgive everyone. First of all forgive
yourself and forgive everyone. And be pleasantly

598
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:21,370
placed towards yourself. There’s no Greek
tragedy going on here – no tragedy. We are

599
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:28,370
in a very beautiful atmosphere and we are
going to go into the most beautiful area within

600
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:39,280
ourselves, that is our spirit. So we have
to be very light about it.

601
01:22:40,520 --> 01:22:47,520
All right, with all this understanding, I
have to request you that we have to take out

602
01:22:49,830 --> 01:22:56,830
your shoes because this Mother Earth also
helps us a lot. And not to be serious – not

603
01:23:13,070 --> 01:23:20,070
to be serious about it. It’s not frivolous,
but it’s fun.

604
01:23:31,730 --> 01:23:38,730
So you have to put your left hand towards
Me, which represents your desire to get realization.

605
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:57,000
If all the Sahaja Yogis could also sit down
it would be very nice. Please be seated and

606
01:23:58,050 --> 01:24:04,000
don’t move about. Left hand towards Me like
that – be comfortable, if you want you can

607
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:10,350
put it on your lap or you can put it up if
you want to. Then the right hand needs to

608
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:17,350
be used for nourishing your centers on the
left-hand side. Now I’ll show you how we’ll

609
01:24:24,050 --> 01:24:29,690
be nourishing. Before that, please remember
that put your both the feet apart from each

610
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:36,690
other – not too much, but slightly. Now,
left hand towards Me. I’ll show you before

611
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:47,350
and then we can close our eyes and work it
out.

612
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:54,350
Put your right hand on your heart – in the
heart resides the Spirit and Kundalini is

613
01:25:00,190 --> 01:25:07,190
the reflection of the Holy Ghost, of the Adi
Shakti, within us, while the Spirit is the

614
01:25:08,420 --> 01:25:15,420
reflection of God Almighty. So we put our
attention to our heart first. Then we take

615
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:29,020
our right hand in the upper portion of our
abdomen on the left-hand side and press it

616
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:36,900
hard. This is the center of our mastery. We
take down our right hand on the lower portion

617
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:45,300
of our abdomen and press it hard. This is
the center of pure knowledge that manifests

618
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:55,860
on our central nervous system. We take back
our hand in the upper portion of our abdomen.

619
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:12,150
And again we take it in the heart, in the
upper portion of our heart. Then we take it

620
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:22,410
in the corner of our neck and our shoulder
and put your head to the right. This is the

621
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:35,920
center we catch when we feel guilty. Then
we take our hand on our forehead and slowly

622
01:26:44,170 --> 01:26:51,170
bring down our head on it to rest. Here we
press it on both the sides and this is the

623
01:26:54,940 --> 01:27:01,940
center to forgive. We take back our hand on
the back side of our head and put our head

624
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:17,680
resting on it - this is the center for asking
forgiveness without feeling guilty. We stretch

625
01:27:20,670 --> 01:27:27,670
our hand, with the center of our palm, we
put it on our head in the soft bone area of

626
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:38,460
our childhood, called as fontanelle bone area,
and slowly we put down our head. Here we stretch

627
01:27:40,090 --> 01:27:47,090
our fingers and move our scalp carefully with
pressure, slowly, clockwise, seven times.

628
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:07,380
That’s all we have to do.

629
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:25,920
Now please close your eyes and don’t open
them until I ask you to open because attention

630
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:34,560
has to go inside. Put your left hand towards
Me. Now first you will feel thoughtless – so

631
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:40,250
don’t fight with your thoughts. Automatically
everything will work out. Don’t fight with

632
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:47,250
your thoughts, just keep watching and ultimately
you will feel cool breeze coming out of your

633
01:28:49,090 --> 01:28:55,160
fontanelle bone area and you’ll also start
feeling cool breeze all around you which is

634
01:28:55,160 --> 01:29:01,770
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, the cool
breeze of the all-pervading power as described

635
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:08,770
by Adi Shankaracharya, Salilam, salilam – it’s
cool, and cool.

636
01:29:09,400 --> 01:29:16,400
So now, we put our left hand this way towards
Me and the right hand on the heart. Here you

637
01:29:23,239 --> 01:29:30,239
have to ask Me a very fundamental question,
three times – “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

638
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:40,500
In your heart, ask the question “Mother,
am I the Spirit?” If you are the spirit

639
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:55,090
you are your master, because in the light
of your spirit you know what is right and

640
01:29:55,090 --> 01:29:58,730
what is wrong – you can guide yourself.

641
01:29:58,730 --> 01:30:05,510
So put your right hand in the upper portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side, and

642
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:12,510
here please ask Me a question again three
times – “Mother, am I my own master?”

643
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:23,300
“Mother, am I my own master?”

644
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:32,800
As I have told you that I will not cross your
freedom, I respect your freedom, and only

645
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:43,760
if you want I can bestow this pure knowledge
on yourself, otherwise I cannot. So please

646
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:54,180
put your right hand in the lower portion of
your abdomen and ask the question, “Mother”

647
01:30:56,040 --> 01:31:03,040
- or you can request “Mother please give
me pure knowledge.” Say this six times because

648
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:20,390
this center has got six petals. “Mother,
please give me pure knowledge.”

649
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:36,830
Now all the prophets of the past and the saints
and seers have built up for us a center of

650
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:49,110
mastery. But to open the center we have to
have all the confidence, so please raise your

651
01:31:54,410 --> 01:32:01,410
hand and put it in the upper portion of your
abdomen on the left-hand side and say with

652
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:10,050
full confidence to nourish this center, ten
times, “Mother, I am my own master.” Please

653
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:26,810
say this ten times.

654
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:39,680
Now we have to know that we are not this body,
we are not this mind, we are not these emotions,

655
01:32:46,090 --> 01:32:53,090
we are not this intellect. We are not our
conditionings or are we our ego. We are pure

656
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:05,530
spirit. So now raise your hand to your heart
and with full confidence say twelve times

657
01:33:05,530 --> 01:33:12,530
“Mother, I am the spirit.” Please say
twelve times, “Mother, I am the spirit.”

658
01:33:21,710 --> 01:33:28,710
You have to know that this Divine Power is
the ocean of love and compassion. It is the

659
01:33:36,219 --> 01:33:43,219
ocean of joy and bliss but above all it is
the ocean of forgiveness, so there is no mistake

660
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:54,500
that you have committed which cannot be dissolved
by this ocean. So please forgive yourself

661
01:33:59,280 --> 01:34:06,280
and put your right hand in the corner of your
neck and your shoulder and turn your head

662
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:15,040
to your right. Here you have to say with complete
confidence again, “Shri Mataji, I am not

663
01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:29,550
guilty at all.” Or you can call Me Mother
– “Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

664
01:34:44,120 --> 01:34:51,120
Sixteen times- please say this sixteen times.

665
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:06,560
Now one has to know whether you forgive someone
or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything

666
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:19,800
– it’s a myth. But if you don’t forgive,
then you play into wrong hands. So put your

667
01:35:20,250 --> 01:35:27,250
right hand on your forehead and please bend
your head, resting on the hand as much as

668
01:35:32,120 --> 01:35:39,120
you can and now press it on both the sides.
And here please, please, say it from your

669
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:49,420
heart “Mother, I forgive everyone.” Please
say it from your heart - please say it, otherwise

670
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:59,830
again I will have to work very hard on you.
So please say it from your heart – “Mother,

671
01:35:59,830 --> 01:36:06,810
I forgive everyone.” You are not going to
miss your self-realization for not forgiving,

672
01:36:06,810 --> 01:36:13,810
please. How many lives you have been seeking
the truth that this time you are not going

673
01:36:22,780 --> 01:36:25,250
to miss it out.

674
01:36:25,250 --> 01:36:32,250
Now take back your hand on the back side of
your head and push back 

675
01:37:18,820 --> 01:37:25,820
your head as much as you can resting on 
your 

676
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:31,980
hand 

677
01:39:55,390 --> 01:40:02,390
and here for your own satisfaction, without
feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

678
01:40:19,070 --> 01:40:26,070
please say, “Oh Divine, if 

679
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:44,750
I 

680
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:17,160
have done any mistakes, please forgive me.”

681
01:41:35,239 --> 01:41:42,239
TAPE ENDS
