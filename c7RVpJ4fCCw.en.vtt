00:05.879 --> 00:07.410
Interviewer: Is this your first visit here?

00:07.410 --> 00:08.760
Shri Mataji: Oh no.

00:08.760 --> 00:09.760
Interviewer: No?

00:09.760 --> 00:11.349
How many times have you been here before?

00:11.349 --> 00:12.349
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

00:12.349 --> 00:14.180
Interviewer: How many times have you been
here?

00:14.180 --> 00:17.650
Shri Mataji: I haven’t counted.

00:17.650 --> 00:20.750
Must be how many times?

00:20.750 --> 00:22.730
From 1974.

00:22.730 --> 00:24.720
Interviewer: Right.

00:24.720 --> 00:29.689
Shri Mataji: Practically every year.

00:29.689 --> 00:33.910
Sometimes I missed one or twice.

00:33.910 --> 00:44.390
Interviewer: And what is the main emphasis
in your teaching?

00:44.390 --> 01:04.680
Shri Mataji: To convey that within us lies
a power which we call as Kundalini in the

01:04.680 --> 01:17.079
triangular bone and when awakened, it passes
through six subtle centres through our spinal

01:17.079 --> 01:27.560
chord, our brain, ultimately into limbic area
and pierces through the fontanel bone area

01:27.560 --> 01:30.810
which was the soft bone in our childhood.

01:30.810 --> 01:39.439
This is the actualization of baptism, actualization.

01:39.439 --> 01:48.909
And this power within us is the reflection
of the Holy Ghost.

01:48.909 --> 01:53.630
Thus you get your second birth, that’s how
you are twice born.

01:53.630 --> 01:55.439
Interviewer: Oh I see.

01:55.439 --> 01:57.700
Shri Mataji: Yes, born again.

01:57.700 --> 01:59.149
Interviewer: And everyone has this?

01:59.149 --> 02:00.149
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

02:00.149 --> 02:01.149
Interviewer: Everyone has this?

02:01.149 --> 02:02.149
Shri Mataji: Everyone everyone has.

02:02.149 --> 02:03.790
Interviewer: And how do people find it?

02:03.790 --> 02:07.060
Shri Mataji: I knew about it since my birth
I think.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.319
Interviewer: And what about the people you
teach?

02:09.319 --> 02:10.319
Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

02:10.319 --> 02:13.780
Interviewer: The people you teach, how can
they find this power?

02:13.780 --> 02:23.810
Shri Mataji: (Unclear) They feel themselves,
the cool breeze on top of their heads.

02:23.810 --> 02:29.380
And they feel they are connected with this
power because they can feel it on their fingertips,

02:29.380 --> 02:35.920
also this power.

02:35.920 --> 02:47.220
Interviewer: And the groups you speak to,
what sort of people are they?

02:47.220 --> 02:52.100
Shri Mataji: (Unclear) Are conditioned people.

02:52.100 --> 02:59.300
Or sometimes ego is there also, lot of ego.

02:59.300 --> 03:11.180
They are not open-minded like scientists are.

03:11.180 --> 03:21.980
And they are conditioned by different faiths
and blind faiths.

03:21.980 --> 03:32.640
Interviewer: I have some information here
which says you have an emphasis on the spiritual

03:32.640 --> 03:36.260
importance of women and their role.

03:36.260 --> 03:40.500
In what way, you know how are women important
in this way?

03:40.500 --> 03:43.210
In establishing the balance of society.

03:43.210 --> 03:46.590
Shri Mataji: Because women are the potential.

03:46.590 --> 04:00.160
Men are the kinetic energy and women don’t
know how powerful they are within themselves

04:00.160 --> 04:04.320
and they try to compete with men and get frustrated.

04:04.320 --> 04:09.710
Interviewer: And how are they powerful in
this way, different from men?

04:09.710 --> 04:17.190
Shri Mataji: Because they have forbearance,
they have lot of forbearance, they are the

04:17.190 --> 04:27.820
preservers of society, they are the preservers
of family life and they create beautiful children.

04:27.820 --> 04:39.970
Motherhood is a sure thing, fatherhood is
uncertain isn’t it?

04:39.970 --> 04:53.580
Interviewer: And so you’ve travelled the
world have you, speaking to people?

04:53.580 --> 04:58.370
Shri Mataji: Yes, I don’t know how many
countries, I travel.

04:58.370 --> 05:05.870
I’ve been to Russia, to all the Eastern
block people.

05:05.870 --> 05:17.030
They seem to be very much clean about it because
they are not so conditioned and in our freedom

05:17.030 --> 05:21.310
we have lost many things which were important
to us.

05:21.310 --> 05:23.850
Interviewer: Such as?

05:23.850 --> 05:36.010
Shri Mataji: Such as chastity, innocence,
simplicity, respect.

05:36.010 --> 05:40.080
Interviewer: And how can people get these
virtues back then?

05:40.080 --> 05:49.890
Shri Mataji: Once these centres are awakened
and nourished you feel physically all right,

05:49.890 --> 06:03.830
mentally all right and your attention is filled
with the light of the Spirit and thus you’ll

06:03.830 --> 06:18.140
see what is spirituality is within yourself
and you understand your beauty.

06:18.140 --> 06:22.870
And then you enjoy your virtues, you become
religious, it’s not a question of saying

06:22.870 --> 06:27.960
I’m this religion, that religion, you just
become religious, you become.

06:27.960 --> 06:35.100
Like one may follow any religion but can do
any sins, they are equally the same, there’s

06:35.100 --> 06:39.900
no difference, it’s just a brand.

06:39.900 --> 06:50.790
Interviewer: The recent Gulf War what sort
of effect has that had on people as a whole?

06:50.790 --> 07:05.210
Shri Mataji: At least one thing is that fundamentalism
is a very dangerous thing.

07:05.210 --> 07:09.100
Any religion that gets exclusive can be very
dangerous.

07:09.100 --> 07:24.510
In Sahaja Yoga you realise that all these
prophets, incarnations, saints were born on

07:24.510 --> 07:36.050
the same tree of life or of spirituality and
we have plucked them, saying this is mine,

07:36.050 --> 07:45.320
this is mine and we are fighting with those
dead flowers.

07:45.320 --> 07:52.660
Interviewer: So how can people be helped through
your type of teaching?

07:52.660 --> 08:12.199
Shri Mataji: Because of this happening you
get completely integrated within yourself.

08:12.199 --> 08:25.639
Also all these centres which are within us
were created by these great incarnations in

08:25.639 --> 08:38.520
the evolutionary process and they are all
lined up together.

08:38.520 --> 08:51.170
Thus we realise that if this Kundalini has
to pass through we have to put them into the

08:51.170 --> 08:54.279
same garland.

08:54.279 --> 09:02.480
It’s a happening.

09:02.480 --> 09:08.290
Interviewer: And how long have you been teaching
this?

09:08.290 --> 09:10.381
Shri Mataji: I started in 1970.

09:10.381 --> 09:17.860
Interviewer: And how long did it take you
to come to this.

09:17.860 --> 09:26.670
Shri Mataji: No I started working out with
one lady to begin with in India.

09:26.670 --> 09:36.420
Then as my husband got elected to a post,
as you must have heard about, he was the Secretary

09:36.420 --> 09:41.310
General of the International Maritime Organisation
U.N..

09:41.310 --> 09:48.100
I went to London and I started with seven
hippies.

09:48.100 --> 09:56.060
They were hippies but very well educated professors
and lawyers and things like that but had become

09:56.060 --> 10:02.830
hippies just for seeking the truth.

10:02.830 --> 10:19.170
I had to work very hard on them but they are
the foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

10:19.170 --> 10:30.200
And that’s how then one of them went abroad
to some other place, it started spreading.

10:30.200 --> 10:37.640
England is a, like a heart of the universe
because everyone comes there and they carry

10:37.640 --> 10:43.330
to their own country.

10:43.330 --> 10:50.550
Interviewer: And which countries have you
been to ..

10:50.550 --> 10:55.970
would there be so many that you ..

10:55.970 --> 11:01.730
Shri Mataji: Yes, I have been at least to
forty five countries.

11:01.730 --> 11:03.650
Interviewer: Really?

11:03.650 --> 11:06.530
Shri Mataji: Yes.

11:06.530 --> 11:12.830
Interviewer: When you were working with these
people how long did it take you to come to

11:12.830 --> 11:14.270
now, to what you understand?

11:14.270 --> 11:16.570
Shri Mataji: About what?

11:16.570 --> 11:18.050
Interviewer: Your teachings.

11:18.050 --> 11:19.910
How did it come together?

11:19.910 --> 11:30.240
Shri Mataji: I see a great future, a new race
is coming up.

11:30.240 --> 11:48.970
They are devoid of all addictions, devoid
of all diseases, devoid of unchaste things,

11:48.970 --> 11:56.730
devoid of things which are wrong like they
lead a very nice married life, have nice children,

11:56.730 --> 12:00.040
absolutely angelic I would say.

12:00.040 --> 12:14.649
I don’t have to tell them anything, they
are on their own because they have evolved.

12:14.649 --> 12:19.680
This is the last breakthrough of our evolution.

12:19.680 --> 12:28.220
They are beautiful people.

12:28.220 --> 12:42.140
We have seventy five to eighty marriages every
year, all international, and except for one

12:42.140 --> 12:53.160
percent, they are all very very successful.

12:53.160 --> 12:59.470
Interviewer: And do you intend on continuing
to travel, how long do you think you will

12:59.470 --> 13:00.470
be travelling for?

13:00.470 --> 13:03.170
Shri Mataji: I can’t say, already I am sixty
eight years of age.

13:03.170 --> 13:11.790
Can’t say, as long as possible I would like
to travel because somehow they like me very

13:11.790 --> 13:15.399
much everywhere I think.

13:15.399 --> 13:22.029
Interviewer: And you obviously enjoy travelling
and speaking to people about it.

13:22.029 --> 13:23.339
Shri Mataji: Yes.

13:23.339 --> 13:25.140
Interviewer: Why do you enjoy doing it?

13:25.140 --> 13:26.140
Shri Mataji: What?

13:26.140 --> 13:29.029
Interviewer: Why do you enjoy travelling and
telling people about this?

13:29.029 --> 13:44.010
Shri Mataji: It’s so nice to see so many
getting the meaning of their life, so many

13:44.010 --> 13:54.370
getting rid of their problems and man-made
nonsense that they have on their heads.

13:54.370 --> 14:00.540
Also they are capable of giving Realizations
to others.

14:00.540 --> 14:08.760
And also if you give vibrations to your agriculture
it improves, to animals if you give it improves.

14:08.760 --> 14:17.710
Also it solves ecological problems because
they become so wise.

14:17.710 --> 14:27.209
We have to worry about the emancipation of
human beings as a whole, as a whole because

14:27.209 --> 14:43.589
we are one world and they all feel they are
citizens of the universe.

14:43.589 --> 14:51.779
And the love they have, respect they have
for each other and the silence they enjoy

14:51.779 --> 14:59.519
shows that we’ll have no more wars, no more
problems and we’ll always abide in the beautiful

14:59.519 --> 15:04.640
realm of kingdom of God.

15:04.640 --> 15:09.959
It’s the greatest satisfaction anybody can.

15:09.959 --> 15:16.880
This cannot be given by money, power, anything.

15:16.880 --> 15:29.310
When I leave one country I feel very much
wrenched, as if my heart is being wrenched

15:29.310 --> 15:34.519
because I feel that I am leaving all of them
there, but when I reach another country I

15:34.519 --> 15:42.830
see again beautiful flower-like faces.

15:42.830 --> 15:45.980
This is what all the incarnations wanted.

15:45.980 --> 15:56.079
We have no organisation as such, I have no
secretary, nothing.

15:56.079 --> 16:00.560
It’s like a stateless state you can call
it.

16:00.560 --> 16:13.610
And we have no problems, we just enjoy that’s
all.

16:13.610 --> 16:17.710
Pure enjoyment.

16:17.710 --> 16:24.660
Interviewer: Thank you very much for your
time, it’s been very interesting, thank

16:24.660 --> 16:25.660
you.

16:25.660 --> 16:34.580
Shri Mataji: You are so intelligent I must
say, I thought you are a little girl, she’s

16:34.580 --> 16:35.990
very intelligent.

16:35.990 --> 16:40.990
Yesterday I was in New Zealand talking to
the interviewer, with the gentleman interviewing,

16:40.990 --> 16:47.269
he felt the cool breeze in his hands immediately
and he came to my program also.

16:47.269 --> 16:51.570
Interviewer: Thank you.

16:51.570 --> 17:01.610
Shri Mataji: Want to take a photograph?

17:01.610 --> 17:03.040
(Unclear).

17:03.040 --> 17:17.380
Sahaja Yogi: She’s got it Shri Mataji, she’s
got it.

17:17.380 --> 17:24.170
Shri Mataji: She’s got it.

17:24.170 --> 17:42.559
First time
I met (unclear) in Australia.

17:42.559 --> 17:46.700
They cannot see subtler things, that’s the
trouble is.

17:46.700 --> 17:50.850
And they also find it’s not so sensational.

17:50.850 --> 18:02.530
It’s the most sensational thing don’t
you think so?

18:02.530 --> 18:19.260
It’s for the betterment of the whole world,
the most sensational thing.

18:19.260 --> 18:27.970
It’s a silent revolution, peaceful revolution
that’s coming.

18:27.970 --> 18:33.410
Has to come after all.

18:33.410 --> 18:39.150
We are waiting for a shock all over.

18:39.150 --> 18:42.669
One thing you must see that for all such things
you cannot pay any money because you always

18:42.669 --> 18:43.669
have these from my country or from other countries.

18:43.669 --> 18:44.669
…..

18:44.669 --> 18:45.669
(unclear).

18:45.669 --> 18:46.669
Don’t go near people who ask for money,
that’s the point.

18:46.669 --> 18:48.800
You cannot pay for all these things.

18:48.800 --> 18:52.870
Formerly I used to pay for my travel everything,
… (unclear) I used to pay.

18:52.870 --> 18:55.650
But now they have said Mother we’ll look
after that, aeroplanes.

18:55.650 --> 18:57.090
All right (unclear) I can’t take money for
that.

18:57.090 --> 18:58.090
It’s invaluable.

18:58.090 --> 19:03.010
And you know Christ never took any money,
nobody took any money, now this new type of

19:03.010 --> 19:05.990
people who have come are already described
in the Bible.

19:05.990 --> 19:10.049
One should run away from that, one after another
they are coming to Australia.

19:10.049 --> 19:16.400
Whenever I came there was this Rajneesh was
there, (unclear) was there, (unclear) was

19:16.400 --> 19:20.940
there and people are so much attracted to
them because they think they are paying.

19:20.940 --> 19:22.480
Wrong idea.

19:22.480 --> 19:24.090
And then they disappear.

19:24.090 --> 19:31.800
Any person who has interest in Rolls Royce
and this kind of thing, how can people (unclear).

19:31.800 --> 19:35.910
They don’t think about it, they don’t
think.

19:35.910 --> 19:51.110
It must be told very very clearly to people,
don’t pay a single pai.

19:51.110 --> 19:54.040
And you must know the accounts, that’s the
point.

19:54.040 --> 19:59.170
Now if I am here, acually I don’t know how
these people organize, it’s among themselves.

19:59.170 --> 20:05.220
They know (unclear), they pay, they do what
they…, I mean say for example they have

20:05.220 --> 20:07.060
a program here they pay for the hall and they
know all that.

20:07.060 --> 20:10.420
I am not interested in that.

20:10.420 --> 20:20.150
Interviewer: Yes well thank you very much,
very interesting, thank you for your time.

20:20.150 --> 20:20.980
Thank you.
