00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.380
It's a very great day for Me to
see so many Sahaja Yogis here

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:20.630
who are from this
country, Greece.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.950
When first I came
to Greece,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.910
I told My husband that this
country is full of vibrations

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.800
and there have been many
evolved souls in this country

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.820
but perhaps the people
have lost their heritage,

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.240
but the vibrations are
in the atmosphere

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.530
and one day Sahaja Yoga
should prosper here very much.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:58.030
And somehow, we met some
bureaucrats who were Greeks and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.900
the experience was not good with
them and My husband said

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.000
that, "If you said that Greeks
are really religious people,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.220
then look at these people
- what are they doing to me?"

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.060
I said, "They may be bureaucrats
and all over, bureaucrats,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.450
you can't say what sort
of people they could be."

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.020
But, on the whole, the vibrations
were very, very good, no doubt,

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.220
and I went to all the places
in here, like I went to Delphi,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.380
I went up there to see Athena's
temple and everything.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.310
To all the places of interest,
they took Me round, especially Me,

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.120
because he was busy
with his conference,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.290
and so they took Me round.
And everywhere I felt

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.110
even the sea I felt was
so beautiful. This was about,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.330
I think I came here at least
about fifteen years back,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.900
maybe fourteen years
back - and I find now

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.410
the vibrations are coming
back now through you people

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.110
and the whole place
is again vibrating.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.220
Now, you have to understand
that you people

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.820
have a very big responsibility
because you're

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.310
strategically placed
in Greece, you see.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.460
Creece and Italy, I mean Turkey,
both are very important.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.250
First of all, you are the bridge
between the eastern side

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.420
and the western side and
everybody is interested in,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.070
somehow or another,
managing these two areas

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.680
so that hey could control
eastern and western side.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.100
I mean the western
countries especially.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.990
Now the greatest danger
that you have now

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.450
is that this western culture
may try to grab you

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.910
and which is very
dangerous.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.370
To understand it,
you have to know

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.470
that you are people coming
from a very great tradition,

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.160
ancient people of ages
just like Indians,

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.460
and there is so much you can do
to improve the culture of Europe

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.740
by your own behavior.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.300
Like these people we have
coming here, tourists are coming,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.900
and they see the
behavior of the Greeks

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.750
and they see that they
can influence very well,

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.580
the Europeans, think that Greeks
can be very easily influenced

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.800
by their culture,
by their cheap life.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.380
So, as you being the
such traditional people,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.950
down to earth and
so many, so many

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.100
good things you
have known in life,

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.610
it's very important to
understand the historical

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.500
background of your country,
first of all.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.860
For Sahaja Yogis it is very
important to be educated that way

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.010
because tomorrow you'll have
to talk to other people

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.480
and you'll have to tell them
about Athena, about your traditions,

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.420
about your background and how
it is connected to Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.890
connected to Mother Mary, connected
to Christ and all those things.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.300
For this, it is very necessary that
we all should try to understand

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.330
the historical background
of this country

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:59.820
and educate yourself in a way that
you can talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.900
As it is, you know, Athena has
the Kundalini in Her hand

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.900
and you can see that clearly
that She was the Adi Shakti.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.900
Actually, in Sanskrit language
atha means primordial.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.700
So She was
the Primordial Mother.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.650
Because there was
no connection

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.580
left between the Greeks
and the Indians,

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.230
this, I mean, translation

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.220
was not there and they didn't
know what it meant by Athena.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.550
But Indians know that it
is this is the place

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.450
for the manifestation
of the Adi Shakti

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.420
because in the Devi Mahatmyam,
if you read, or you will find out

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.380
they have described Greece
as the Manipurndwip.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.260
Means the island in the Manipur.
Manipur is this Nabhi Chakra.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:02.230
So in the Nabhi there's an
island where it is your Greece,

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.860
where the Goddess resides.
Manipur chakra is where She resides.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.290
And so, this Athena has
been described,

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.640
and when I went to Her
temple I found that there was

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:23.010
a little temple for the child God.
That was Shri Ganesha.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.750
And then, when I went to Delphi,
also, when I went there

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.060
I was surprised to see, they showed
Me a mound and said,

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.990
"This is the Nabhi, navel
of the whole universe."

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.240
I said, "That's correct." But when
I turned round there

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:41.920
were lots of vibrations and what
I find is a Ganesha statue there.

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.770
Then Gregoire came here
he took photographs

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.170
and everything
and he saw that.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.960
So now you are the Nabhi.
You are sitting here in the Nabhi

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.290
of the whole universe.
So how important is Nabhi?

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.350
You know that very well,
that Nabhi Chakra gets spoilt,

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.540
the whole life becomes
miserable for a human being.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.340
So, on the right side of
the Nabhi, as you see,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:14.640
is the liver and because, of course,
we had lots of philosophers,

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:19.560
they used to think a lot and
they created lots of tragedies,

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:23.730
you see Greek tragedy's well
known, where a marriage system was

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:29.100
little bit challenged, that
there was, say, two men,

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:32.790
one woman or maybe
two women, one man

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.270
and never they felt happy
with the marriage.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.490
So the left Nabhi was
under attack, throughout.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.780
To have such a tragedy, they
wrote so many, I would say,

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:51.620
so many dramas and they played them
here and so many plays were there

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.930
showing that there are two
men and one woman

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.240
or two women and one
man and no relationship

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.800
between the husband
and wife which was pure.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.440
And that was the tragedy.

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.670
It's known all over
as the Greek tragedy.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:10.370
It's all imaginary
and people, you see,

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.870
became very left-sided to
begin with. They started thinking,

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.350
Oh, this life is a misery.
It's a tragedy.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:21.130
What should we do?
Why should we?

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:26.360
Why should we try to
show that we are happy?

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.370
We are very
unhappy people.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.810
And all these things
started here to begin with.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.250
Then came these
your Orthodox Church.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:38.780
Now this Orthodox Church is
another one, which, of course,

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:43.070
is really doesn't treat women
very well and treats them

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:48.740
as if they are all the
time unholy. Certain times

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.470
they cannot go to church
and they cannot touch people,

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.590
all kinds of nonsensical
ideas they had.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.020
That also made women
very left-sided.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.040
Then, on top of that,
all this was happening

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.300
with these tragedies
and all that.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:11.280
Suddenly the economic problem
came up and people felt very,

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:14.680
sort of, disgusted
about that.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.130
So the left side
became very,

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.930
very prominent here
and that is how I think

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.530
many of these left-sided,

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.710
bhootish organizations
started here

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.240
and many gurus came who
made you feel miserable.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.110
But the worst that was
done by the Greek Church

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.980
which made you feel so guilty.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.330
So you became
very left-sided.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.710
Now this left-sidedness was
later on counter-balanced

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.460
by people who started
becoming overactive;

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.690
thinking too much, working too
hard and all those things.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:56.370
But still, I think that they don't
work very hard as they should work.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.060
They're on the lazy side,
the Greeks are.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.120
They're on the lazy side. Of course,
the Sahaja Yogis are not.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.840
The Sahaja Yogis have
worked very hard,

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:07.160
I can see all that very
clearly, but otherwise.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.570
So, now to bring
out Sahaja Yoga

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.190
in Greece, is important,
first of all, to know

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:20.980
what is our historical
background.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.690
The second, they should
be very well equipped

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.120
with the knowledge
of chakras and centers

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:33.510
and how to improve these centers.
If you do not have that knowledge,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.650
you cannot face people. It's not
that only men should know,

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.560
women also should
know everything about it.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.450
What is the chakras are,
how they work out

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:50.140
and what are their results
are, how do we suffer

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.620
because our chakras
are in danger.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.550
All this knowledge
is free to you.

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.790
You don't have to pay for
this knowledge. Only thing,

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.660
every day-to-day life, when you
start working out Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:08.370
then you'll find that what I'm
saying is absolutely tangible.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:13.700
You can verify it. It is so.
It's not something in the air.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:17.520
It is absolutely there.
We can prove everything

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.410
that we believe in and we
can show others also

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.320
that this is the truth.
Is an absolute truth.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.810
We are not here to
spread some sort

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.680
of a fanaticism or racialism
or anything like that,

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.950
but we are here to combine
the whole world together

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.550
under one understanding; that
we belong to one universe

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:43.610
and we have one
universal religion.

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.490
Now, people will ask
you then,

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.190
"Have we to give up
your religion?"

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.880
You don't have to tell them that
you have to give up your religion,

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.910
don't have to say that. You don't
have to be hard with them at all.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.320
On the contrary, no, no, no,
nothing has to be done.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.180
You just come and take to Sahaja
Yoga and take to your spirit.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:04.070
Gradually it will start
opening out.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.270
It has happened with
all of you

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.270
that first when you
came to Sahaja Yoga

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:11.310
you were in a different
shape. Now gradually,

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.210
you started opening
out, you matured

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.200
and you understood
Sahaja Yoga very well.

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:21.270
In the same way, you must
teach others in the same manner,

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:26.380
with the same understanding,
compassion and love.

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.790
Otherwise, normally people
think that somebody

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.400
is to be condemned
all the time.

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:36.800
Of course, some are people
who are under bad influence

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.860
and you cannot get along
with them, but most of you

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:45.340
should know that we have to get
more people into Sahaja Yoga

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:51.870
through our compassion, love
and also lot of understanding

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:58.400
about others' feelings. I've
found that even countries

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:01.540
where have been Sahaja
Yoga for so many time,

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:07.010
suddenly someone comes up
and starts giving trouble

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:12.300
and becoming bhootish sort of
thing, you see, and misbehaving.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.670
Suddenly, it happens. Such a person,
you know, if it is informed,

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.730
we can take him out of Sahaja
Yoga. We can cleanse him.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.710
But all of you must know
one thing for definite

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.420
that you all have these
powers to cure yourself,

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.920
improve yourself,
to help others.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.440
You can do everything
yourself.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.450
You all have these powers,
but the only thing

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:36.760
is you have to be
sincere and honest.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.880
If you are not sincere and
honest, it will never work out.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.210
On the contrary, it will
boomerang on you.

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:49.620
So, in Sahaja Yoga, it's very impor-
tant is the sincerity of purpose.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.690
You must have complete
sincerity of purpose

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:58.210
that you are here to achieve your
own self-emancipation, first.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:05.670
And secondly, you are
here to help others.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:11.620
The people all along in the
whole world now require help.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:15.690
There's so many problems,
so many catastrophes,

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:22.530
so many horrible things
we everyday know going on.

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.400
So now we need people who
are solid, who are balanced,

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.660
who are peaceful, who understand
what is right and what is wrong.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.980
But apart from that,
you should know

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.870
that you have now entered
into the Kingdom of God.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.660
Many people will say, all right,
we were so religious,

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.890
we were praying to Christ,
we were praying to this one,

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.800
praying to that one.
What did we get?

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.670
You cannot get it because
you are not connected.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.310
You have to be connected. Once
you are connected to that,

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.310
then you will find that
things start sorting out.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.250
But sincerity is very important
and faith in yourself.

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:02.480
You must have faith in yourself
that you're quite capable,

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:07.000
quite capable person and
you can achieve

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.810
a very high degree of awareness by
which you can work out many things.

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.240
It doesn't matter from what sort
of background you come in.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.830
It doesn't matter from what sort
of country you come in,

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:19.310
race anything.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.020
You all can do very well

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:26.260
and we have seen this happening in
so many countries where we had

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:33.340
no hope at all. For example,
a country like Russia,

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:37.740
imagine, they've never
worshipped any God.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:41.000
They didn't know about God.
They were not allowed to know

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.500
about any religion,
anything,

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.620
but suddenly I went there, I don't
know, they recognized Me, suddenly.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.040
They just recognized Me and
just with My photograph

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:53.590
I find them there. I was
amazed that the first time

00:15:53.890 --> 00:16:02.570
I went to Leningrad there were
two thousand seats in the hall,

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.090
but outside they were
all standing. I said,

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:07.020
"Why are they standing
outside?" They said,

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.660
"All the seats are full, Mother,
and these are extra people.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.290
There are more than two
thousand outside." So I said,

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:16.930
"This is too much." And so they
said, "Mother, what about us?"

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.060
I said, "All right, let me
finish the program."

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.990
I went inside, did the program,
everything happened

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:23.420
and you'll be amazed

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.140
when we had the program,
the people who were outside

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.400
were still waiting. I gave
realization to people

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.500
and they were waiting,
waiting, waiting.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.350
When I came out
I gave them.

00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:37.470
I said, "Now, what to do?

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.880
I can't give you
realization just now."

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.320
So they said, "All right,
what can we do?"

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:44.500
I said, "Tomorrow morning
can you come?" They said,

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:48.000
"All right." So all those who were
inside and those who were outside,

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.210
all of them came and
came and sat down

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:56.460
and that open ground and
I gave them realization.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.830
So this is the first beginning,
but now in Moscow

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:05.860
or any place we have to
reserve a huge, big stadium.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.080
Fourteen to sixteen
thousand people are there

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.000
and realization is
being given.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:16.020
But they are so quick
to accept Sahaja Yoga,

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.710
so quick to accept Me, so quick
to understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:26.230
I just can't imagine how these
Russians have got this capacity.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:29.760
No question of their
going back,

00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.410
no question of their
sincerity being challenged.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:38.530
There is no question of their
doubting themselves, nothing.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:43.380
Just there and so much so,
so much that I sometimes feel

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.160
this democracy has
just harmed us.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.600
Because of democracy,of course,
we could do Sahaja Yoga all right,

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:54.870
but where the people are,
absolutely sometimes very idiotic.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.680
Like in America, I find there's
very idiotic people live there

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:03.500
and they were only busy
choosing their bathrooms

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:08.080
and their curtains and their soaps
and all the time they will choose,

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.820
only busy with all these
nonsensical things.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:17.740
They are so idiotic, while the
people in Russia are so sensible,

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:24.810
so deep, so introspective and
even the artists and the scientists.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:30.580
I had a conference with the scientists.
There were about three hundred of them

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.010
and I started talking to
them about science.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:34.520
I thought, better start
with science.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.430
They said, "Mother, no more
science, no more science.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:40.500
Tell us the science
of God."

00:18:42.130 --> 00:18:43.630
Such open-minded people.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:46.750
We have two hundred
doctors in Russia

00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:52.030
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga
and it has spread up to Siberia.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:57.510
Now, what's the use
of this democracy

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.950
which doesn't take us to God.
It doesn't give us sense

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:05.010
that we should seek God and
we should be humble towards God.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:09.240
So what's the use of having
this kind of a democracy and

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:14.210
this kind of freedom which has
made us mad and idiotic?

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.550
And that's very true about
every democratic country

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.430
because you must know
democracy is money-oriented.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.600
And you know Greeks are very money
-oriented people also, as well.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.310
Of course, they're not
as bad as Americans,

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.330
but they are quite
money-oriented.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.850
Also, Italians are very
money-oriented,

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:35.540
but the worst is
the corruption.

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.060
Now Italy is getting
exposed.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.480
I'm sure your country will
also get exposed.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:42.450
All these countries
are to be exposed.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:46.620
But, first of all, the Sahaja
Yogis have to be firm people.

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:50.770
They have to be very, very
firm and they should know that

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.340
Sahaja Yoga is only
spirit-oriented,

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.480
nothing but
spirit-oriented,

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.680
that you have to have
your spirit enlightened,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.190
that your spirit has
to work everything,

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:06.040
that you are not this body,
this money, this position,

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:09.890
these powers, nothing.
But you are the spirit.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.950
This is what one
has to know.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.670
I was told it is very
difficult for you

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:20.500
to come for pujas
to Cabella

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.420
you all cannot join,
but one week,

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.360
supposing you take
during Guru Puja, I think.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:30.820
You can come by boat
or something like that,

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:34.440
would be easier for you to
come to Genoa by boat

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.610
and then we can organize
your coming down.

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:41.350
For Guru Puja, you all should
come. You see, Sahasrara Puja

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.050
and Guru Puja are
very important

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:49.950
and if you could come for Guru
Puja, it would be a very nice idea.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.530
I think it can be
arranged and organized

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:56.630
that you can come
to Guru Puja.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.200
I know it's wherever I am,

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.870
supposing if I have it here, then
for all the rest of the people

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.460
it will be far away. So
I just thought of Milan

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:12.080
being quite in the center that
it would be nearer to England,

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.790
nearer to other European
countries.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.430
You see, the Americans and
the South Americans

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.510
find it very difficult,
so this time

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.040
we had to provide all
tickets, everything

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:27.830
to South Americans to come.
But they're very deep people.

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.520
I was surprised in Colombia, they
are such good Sahaja Yogis,

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.560
very beautiful
Sahaja Yogis.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:38.140
Very simple-hearted, very
good, well educated.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:42.880
Three, four of them got married
in India and they're very happy.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:52.890
So, now for that, two
things have to be done.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:22:00.730
Firstly, is that you
should come to collective.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:04.010
It's very important. You all
should come to collective

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:08.450
and put your - please put attention
to Me, not to them, alright.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:10.780
Please put your attention
towards Me,

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:12.700
don't turn your attention
very much.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:17.600
You have to keep your attention
all right. It's very important.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:25.060
So you have to one thing is
to do, is to come to the collective

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.000
and watch out for your attention.
Where is your attention?

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.850
Where are you looking? Are you
turning your head too much

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.550
or are you putting your
attention straight?

00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:38.180
It's very important that you
must keep your attention

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.810
absolutely wrapped and
towards the meetings

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:47.550
that you have here for
your collective.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:51.650
In that way, when your
attention is fixed you'll find

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:55.070
you'll definitely rise into
thoughtless awareness,

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.590
a state where you
grow spiritually.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.770
You have to rise up to that
state of thoughtless awareness

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.890
where you grow
spiritually.

00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.890
If you're not in thoughtless
awareness,

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:09.860
you cannot grow in
your spirituality.

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:14.220
So it's very important to
see where is your attention.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.480
Where are you putting
your attention?

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.820
If the attention could
be controlled

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.150
then things will
be all right.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.300
He is crying,
the child is crying,

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:28.040
may be you can take
him outside a litle bit,

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:42.040
he is feeling hot I think
is all right now with the mother

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.230
So the first thing is to
be in the collective.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:06.440
Now it's a very sinister,
also idea of some people

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.640
is to always break the
collective, to create problems,

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:16.350
to disregard the leaders. As a
result, leaders also get so fed up,

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.220
they give up, you see. They don't
want to have anything to do.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:23.990
So they put up their own ideas,
they try to trouble the leaders,

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.530
they create problems for them, they
just try to show off everywhere,

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:34.450
as if they know everything. All
such people also create groups.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:40.800
So beware about them. You should
stick on always to the collective

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:46.780
and not to anyone who tries to
create a kind of a group at all

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:52.670
or who troubles or who
makes things difficult.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.380
You must understand those who
are collective only will grow,

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:02.750
those who aren't, will not grow.
Because like a nail, if it breaks,

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:07.100
then it doesn't grow.
In the same manner,

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:11.090
if you keep out of this
thing, by any chance,

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.370
if you have any problems
with the leaders,

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.310
you can always
write to Me,

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.500
you can tell Me,
I can work it out.

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:22.380
But all the time, to go on
like this and grouping

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.580
like this will break and there
will be someone who'll do that.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.690
There will be some negative
person who'll try to do that.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:33.660
So, you have to be very careful
not to get out of the collective.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.340
You must always
support the collective,

00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:41.940
must help this collective
and must nourish it.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.970
As you know, I was
telling him also

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.890
that he, if he has
problem with money,

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.870
we can give money
from Cabella

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:54.350
because before that I used
to travel on My own.

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:58.540
Even to Greece, I came on
My own, and paid for everything.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:02.110
So, see also, then Stomatis
had to pay something,

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.010
which I didn't like very much.
He was paying so much,

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.090
because we had such
a small group.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.900
But now as you have a big
group, you feel responsible,

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.520
you want to pay for it.
All right, doesn't matter.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:19.590
But not to pay for your Sahaja
Yoga, not for your realization,

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:24.210
not for knowledge of Sahaja
Yoga. This is there.

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:27.850
And so people will start putting
ideas into your heads that,

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.170
Why this? Why that?",
and all that.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:33.280
Such people you should keep
out because you are here

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.010
to develop your spirituality
and not to listen

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.800
to these stupid people who
have been troublesome.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:42.310
So best is to keep
to your own,

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.890
own development and own
nourishment. It's very important.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:52.280
So it is in a way collective,
but also individual,

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.460
because what you're
gaining out of the collective

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.990
you should be on the watch
out, you should see for yourself

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.430
what you are gaining
out of the collective.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.250
Then secondly, at home, you
must every day, every day,

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:07.370
every day, again I say,
not to miss it out,

00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:12.330
in the evening before sleeping
you must have meditation.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.120
You can wash
yourself up, like,

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:17.390
what you call, the water
treatment or anything

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.610
then sit down for meditation
for ten minutes.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.210
You must give fifteen minutes to
yourself and then sleep off.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.080
Supposing you can't do
one night, doesn't matter,

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.710
but try to do it every
night. If not possible,

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.160
if you don't do it one night,
you can do it in the morning.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.960
But it's very important. I can
easily make out a person

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:39.490
who does meditation and
who does not do meditation.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:44.590
It's a difference, such a difference.
I immediately know a person

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:49.810
who is meditating
everyday, in his health,

00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:54.630
in his face, in his behavior,
in everything, he's very different.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.130
And those who do not do
any meditation you'll find,

00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:02.330
not only that they are funny,
but their children are funny,

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:06.510
their relationships are
funny, everything is funny.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.880
So the meditation is
a very important part for you.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:13.620
Because also the women
who are pregnant, when they,

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.370
if they do not meditate
their children turn out

00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:21.430
to be very troublesome and very
funny. It's a thing like that.

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:26.200
It effects everything. But your
character of meditativeness,

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:32.250
your character of Sahaja Yoga
helps everyone, your children,

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:34.920
your family, your society,
everybody,

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.820
and everybody can make it out
what sort of a family you are,

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:42.460
what sort of a people you are,
what sort of a personality you are.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:44.680
And from you they
take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:50.620
So is important in individual life
also just to meditate, nothing else.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:55.930
You have to come to a state
of thoughtless awareness.

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:58.780
So the mantra is, as
you know, Nirvichara.

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:01.090
You should use the
mantra of Nirvichara

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:03.550
for coming to the
state of thoughtlessness

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:05.960
and try to increase
this area,

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:08.160
this space of thoughtless
awareness

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:12.540
and that is how you will find
you will be growing very much.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.060
Now as you get lots of powers,
as you get lots of people

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:20.080
being realized by you,
curing by you,

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:22.860
sometimes maybe it
might affect your ego.

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:27.380
You might get into ego things.
For such people, I have to say

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.660
that you have to be introspective
and see for yourself.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.480
You face the mirror and ask
now how much ego you have.

00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:36.940
Laugh at yourself. Once you
start laughing at yourself,

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:39.670
your ego will drop out
and you'll understand

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.920
that it was false to have this
kind of ego within you.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:47.450
There are so many ways and methods
of finding out about yourself.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:51.010
Put yourself into bandhan and put
your hands towards the photograph,

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:53.720
immediately you can feel what
chakras are catching

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:58.020
and you know how to clear it out.
Also sometimes you feel it inside.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.710
If your chakras are catching,
you can feel it inside

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:06.100
and you can feel it,
the different centers

00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:08.720
on your fingertips
about yourself.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.390
So it is about yourself you will
know. About others, you know,

00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.760
you should just talk on
chakras. You should not say,

00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:18.940
he's bhootish, or he has ego
- nothing. But you should say,

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:22.440
his Agnya is catching,
means he has got ego.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.720
You can say, his Nabhi's bad,
his, this thing is bad.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.650
So the language is
to change now.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:32.970
We have to talk in the
language of Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:37.530
It is to be understood that
now we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.050
We've got the powers
we have vibratory powers.

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:45.950
But if you don't use these vibratory
powers, what is going to happen?

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:48.760
We have to use them,
that's the point.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.190
We always forget. I've
seen, the other day

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.320
they couldn't open something.
I said, "Give a bandhan."

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:56.000
Gave a bandhan and immediately
it worked out, you see.

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.230
Small, small things also
you'll be surprised

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.330
that if it doesn't work out, you have
to just give a bandhan

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:02.040
and it works out.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.740
It is important to know
that you are Sahaja Yogis,

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.660
you are saints and that
you can do lots of things

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.210
and you shouldn't forget it.
You shouldn't forget it

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:13.480
that you are Sahaja Yogis. Now
you are no more ordinary people.

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:16.270
You are saints now and
you can do a lot.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:20.520
All this, when it works out,
you'll be amazed at yourself how,

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.690
how you have achieved
all these things.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.150
And, I tell you, people tell Me
that they look like roses,

00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:30.220
all of their faces shining,
they look so beautiful and

00:31:30.530 --> 00:31:32.580
they can make it out that
you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:35.300
I've seen at the airport
also many people say that,

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.990
"Who were those people

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:42.160
looking so sweet and beautiful,
shining. Who were those?"

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.230
So if I tell them that they
are saints, they won't believe

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.980
that there could be so
many saints, but there are

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:50.580
and we have achieved
that all over the world.

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:53.150
All over the world now there
are so many Sahaja Yogis

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:57.500
that I can't even say how many they
are, in thousands and thousands.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.980
So, I again tell
you that Greece

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.310
is a place where
you can do a lot.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.610
First of all, you must establish
yourself in Sahaja Yoga

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.030
and you have to
know what you are,

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:11.750
all the time to remember what
you are. You are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.250
Even to children, you have
to say, "You are a Sahaja Yogi,"

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:17.290
so they also develop that
personality by which

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:20.470
they behave properly and
they behave in a manner

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.540
that a Sahaja Yogi
should behave.

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:29.700
So all these things are just
the preliminaries of Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:33.800
but I am sure you must be
getting my tapes from Cabella

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.910
and you must be knowing
about all the deeper things

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:39.660
about yourself and
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:43.760
It's a new age
that has started.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:47.370
The other day I said that the
Satya Yuga has started now.

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:50.100
So it will start exposing
all that is a-satya,

00:32:50.410 --> 00:32:53.040
which is whatever is false.
All those who are false people

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:57.480
will be exposed and you'll
be amazed at the way

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:02.190
things will work out. And it's
such a great time you are born

00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.640
and it's such a great thing that
you have come to Sahaja Yoga

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.790
and that you have
got your realization

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.060
and that you are
one of those

00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:15.330
who have to lift the whole of this
universe into a higher awareness.

00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.640
Of course, we can't say
how many will be saved.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.820
It's another point because
what I know about is that

00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:26.730
in the evolutionary portion,
supposing we came from chimpanzees,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.960
many were lost
in between, you know,

00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:34.010
and there are so many
chimpanzees now left

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:36.950
and there's the middle,
the people were lost.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.180
In the same way, many
human beings may be lost

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:43.540
because of their stupidity, because
of their self-destructive habits

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:46.050
that they have formed.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:48.290
But your responsibility
is very great.

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:51.400
Don't think, I am just mediocre.
I'm good for nothing.

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:53.020
Never. Never think
like that.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:57.060
You are all saints and you
are capable of great things.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:59.900
May God bless you.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.980
So today they want to
do the puja of Athena

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:10.210
And you will be surprised
that the names of Athena

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:15.990
are exactly about the same as
that of the Goddess, of Adi Shakti.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:19.270
Is very surprising, they
have such beautiful names.

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:23.500
But we can have hundred
and eight names of… today

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:26.650
and you can read the
names and the meanings

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.900
and they can
say the mantras.

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.670
But first the children
have to wash My feet

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:35.280
with Ganesha stuti,
you can sing

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.460
Ganesha stuti.

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:42.500
You've got some musical
instrument or not?

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:45.830
Yes, yes.
You have.
