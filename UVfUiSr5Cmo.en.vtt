00:07.400 --> 00:13.380
It's a very great day for Me to
see so many Sahaja Yogis here

00:13.780 --> 00:20.630
who are from this
country, Greece.

00:22.380 --> 00:25.950
When first I came
to Greece,

00:26.270 --> 00:30.910
I told My husband that this
country is full of vibrations

00:31.190 --> 00:36.800
and there have been many
evolved souls in this country

00:37.310 --> 00:40.820
but perhaps the people
have lost their heritage,

00:41.210 --> 00:44.240
but the vibrations are
in the atmosphere

00:44.690 --> 00:49.530
and one day Sahaja Yoga
should prosper here very much.

00:50.320 --> 00:58.030
And somehow, we met some
bureaucrats who were Greeks and

00:58.430 --> 01:02.900
the experience was not good with
them and My husband said

01:03.180 --> 01:07.000
that, "If you said that Greeks
are really religious people,

01:07.260 --> 01:10.220
then look at these people
- what are they doing to me?"

01:10.530 --> 01:14.060
I said, "They may be bureaucrats
and all over, bureaucrats,

01:14.330 --> 01:16.450
you can't say what sort
of people they could be."

01:16.700 --> 01:23.020
But, on the whole, the vibrations
were very, very good, no doubt,

01:23.340 --> 01:29.220
and I went to all the places
in here, like I went to Delphi,

01:29.520 --> 01:33.380
I went up there to see Athena's
temple and everything.

01:33.720 --> 01:39.310
To all the places of interest,
they took Me round, especially Me,

01:41.970 --> 01:45.120
because he was busy
with his conference,

01:45.390 --> 01:49.290
and so they took Me round.
And everywhere I felt

01:49.590 --> 01:54.110
even the sea I felt was
so beautiful. This was about,

01:54.400 --> 01:59.330
I think I came here at least
about fifteen years back,

01:59.600 --> 02:04.900
maybe fourteen years
back - and I find now

02:05.950 --> 02:09.410
the vibrations are coming
back now through you people

02:09.830 --> 02:13.110
and the whole place
is again vibrating.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.220
Now, you have to understand
that you people

02:15.560 --> 02:18.820
have a very big responsibility
because you're

02:19.070 --> 02:23.310
strategically placed
in Greece, you see.

02:23.620 --> 02:29.460
Creece and Italy, I mean Turkey,
both are very important.

02:30.170 --> 02:34.250
First of all, you are the bridge
between the eastern side

02:34.510 --> 02:39.420
and the western side and
everybody is interested in,

02:39.800 --> 02:43.070
somehow or another,
managing these two areas

02:43.360 --> 02:48.680
so that hey could control
eastern and western side.

02:50.890 --> 02:54.100
I mean the western
countries especially.

02:54.370 --> 02:56.990
Now the greatest danger
that you have now

02:57.270 --> 03:01.450
is that this western culture
may try to grab you

03:01.780 --> 03:04.910
and which is very
dangerous.

03:06.510 --> 03:09.370
To understand it,
you have to know

03:09.680 --> 03:13.470
that you are people coming
from a very great tradition,

03:13.820 --> 03:18.160
ancient people of ages
just like Indians,

03:18.890 --> 03:25.460
and there is so much you can do
to improve the culture of Europe

03:25.800 --> 03:28.740
by your own behavior.

03:29.020 --> 03:33.300
Like these people we have
coming here, tourists are coming,

03:33.800 --> 03:39.900
and they see the
behavior of the Greeks

03:40.450 --> 03:45.750
and they see that they
can influence very well,

03:47.290 --> 03:53.580
the Europeans, think that Greeks
can be very easily influenced

03:53.830 --> 03:57.800
by their culture,
by their cheap life.

03:58.530 --> 04:03.380
So, as you being the
such traditional people,

04:03.680 --> 04:08.950
down to earth and
so many, so many

04:09.490 --> 04:14.100
good things you
have known in life,

04:14.450 --> 04:18.610
it's very important to
understand the historical

04:18.920 --> 04:21.500
background of your country,
first of all.

04:21.780 --> 04:26.860
For Sahaja Yogis it is very
important to be educated that way

04:27.150 --> 04:30.010
because tomorrow you'll have
to talk to other people

04:30.350 --> 04:35.480
and you'll have to tell them
about Athena, about your traditions,

04:35.770 --> 04:40.420
about your background and how
it is connected to Sahaja Yoga,

04:40.710 --> 04:44.890
connected to Mother Mary, connected
to Christ and all those things.

04:45.180 --> 04:50.300
For this, it is very necessary that
we all should try to understand

04:50.600 --> 04:53.330
the historical background
of this country

04:53.890 --> 04:59.820
and educate yourself in a way that
you can talk about Sahaja Yoga.

05:00.580 --> 05:03.900
As it is, you know, Athena has
the Kundalini in Her hand

05:04.230 --> 05:08.900
and you can see that clearly
that She was the Adi Shakti.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.900
Actually, in Sanskrit language
atha means primordial.

05:13.170 --> 05:15.700
So She was
the Primordial Mother.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.650
Because there was
no connection

05:17.920 --> 05:20.580
left between the Greeks
and the Indians,

05:20.860 --> 05:24.230
this, I mean, translation

05:24.520 --> 05:29.220
was not there and they didn't
know what it meant by Athena.

05:30.300 --> 05:33.550
But Indians know that it
is this is the place

05:33.860 --> 05:39.450
for the manifestation
of the Adi Shakti

05:39.850 --> 05:44.420
because in the Devi Mahatmyam,
if you read, or you will find out

05:44.740 --> 05:48.380
they have described Greece
as the Manipurndwip.

05:48.710 --> 05:55.260
Means the island in the Manipur.
Manipur is this Nabhi Chakra.

05:55.610 --> 06:02.230
So in the Nabhi there's an
island where it is your Greece,

06:02.570 --> 06:06.860
where the Goddess resides.
Manipur chakra is where She resides.

06:08.150 --> 06:12.290
And so, this Athena has
been described,

06:12.520 --> 06:16.640
and when I went to Her
temple I found that there was

06:16.930 --> 06:23.010
a little temple for the child God.
That was Shri Ganesha.

06:23.290 --> 06:26.750
And then, when I went to Delphi,
also, when I went there

06:27.030 --> 06:30.060
I was surprised to see, they showed
Me a mound and said,

06:30.340 --> 06:33.990
"This is the Nabhi, navel
of the whole universe."

06:34.250 --> 06:37.240
I said, "That's correct." But when
I turned round there

06:37.510 --> 06:41.920
were lots of vibrations and what
I find is a Ganesha statue there.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.770
Then Gregoire came here
he took photographs

06:45.070 --> 06:47.170
and everything
and he saw that.

06:47.480 --> 06:50.960
So now you are the Nabhi.
You are sitting here in the Nabhi

06:51.230 --> 06:54.290
of the whole universe.
So how important is Nabhi?

06:54.610 --> 06:59.350
You know that very well,
that Nabhi Chakra gets spoilt,

06:59.620 --> 07:03.540
the whole life becomes
miserable for a human being.

07:03.820 --> 07:07.340
So, on the right side of
the Nabhi, as you see,

07:08.160 --> 07:14.640
is the liver and because, of course,
we had lots of philosophers,

07:14.950 --> 07:19.560
they used to think a lot and
they created lots of tragedies,

07:19.830 --> 07:23.730
you see Greek tragedy's well
known, where a marriage system was

07:24.020 --> 07:29.100
little bit challenged, that
there was, say, two men,

07:29.390 --> 07:32.790
one woman or maybe
two women, one man

07:33.050 --> 07:36.270
and never they felt happy
with the marriage.

07:36.580 --> 07:40.490
So the left Nabhi was
under attack, throughout.

07:40.780 --> 07:45.780
To have such a tragedy, they
wrote so many, I would say,

07:46.110 --> 07:51.620
so many dramas and they played them
here and so many plays were there

07:51.920 --> 07:54.930
showing that there are two
men and one woman

07:55.240 --> 07:59.240
or two women and one
man and no relationship

07:59.550 --> 08:02.800
between the husband
and wife which was pure.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.440
And that was the tragedy.

08:04.700 --> 08:07.670
It's known all over
as the Greek tragedy.

08:07.940 --> 08:10.370
It's all imaginary
and people, you see,

08:10.640 --> 08:13.870
became very left-sided to
begin with. They started thinking,

08:14.130 --> 08:17.350
Oh, this life is a misery.
It's a tragedy.

08:17.590 --> 08:21.130
What should we do?
Why should we?

08:21.560 --> 08:26.360
Why should we try to
show that we are happy?

08:26.630 --> 08:28.370
We are very
unhappy people.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.810
And all these things
started here to begin with.

08:32.110 --> 08:35.250
Then came these
your Orthodox Church.

08:35.550 --> 08:38.780
Now this Orthodox Church is
another one, which, of course,

08:39.010 --> 08:43.070
is really doesn't treat women
very well and treats them

08:43.340 --> 08:48.740
as if they are all the
time unholy. Certain times

08:49.010 --> 08:52.470
they cannot go to church
and they cannot touch people,

08:52.740 --> 08:55.590
all kinds of nonsensical
ideas they had.

08:55.940 --> 08:59.020
That also made women
very left-sided.

08:59.350 --> 09:02.040
Then, on top of that,
all this was happening

09:02.320 --> 09:04.300
with these tragedies
and all that.

09:04.710 --> 09:11.280
Suddenly the economic problem
came up and people felt very,

09:11.560 --> 09:14.680
sort of, disgusted
about that.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.130
So the left side
became very,

09:17.450 --> 09:20.930
very prominent here
and that is how I think

09:21.190 --> 09:23.530
many of these left-sided,

09:23.800 --> 09:27.710
bhootish organizations
started here

09:28.300 --> 09:32.240
and many gurus came who
made you feel miserable.

09:32.560 --> 09:35.110
But the worst that was
done by the Greek Church

09:35.460 --> 09:37.980
which made you feel so guilty.

09:38.280 --> 09:41.330
So you became
very left-sided.

09:42.270 --> 09:45.710
Now this left-sidedness was
later on counter-balanced

09:45.980 --> 09:48.460
by people who started
becoming overactive;

09:48.730 --> 09:52.690
thinking too much, working too
hard and all those things.

09:53.030 --> 09:56.370
But still, I think that they don't
work very hard as they should work.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.060
They're on the lazy side,
the Greeks are.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.120
They're on the lazy side. Of course,
the Sahaja Yogis are not.

10:02.380 --> 10:03.840
The Sahaja Yogis have
worked very hard,

10:04.150 --> 10:07.160
I can see all that very
clearly, but otherwise.

10:07.480 --> 10:13.570
So, now to bring
out Sahaja Yoga

10:13.930 --> 10:17.190
in Greece, is important,
first of all, to know

10:17.450 --> 10:20.980
what is our historical
background.

10:21.240 --> 10:23.690
The second, they should
be very well equipped

10:23.920 --> 10:27.120
with the knowledge
of chakras and centers

10:27.400 --> 10:33.510
and how to improve these centers.
If you do not have that knowledge,

10:33.760 --> 10:36.650
you cannot face people. It's not
that only men should know,

10:36.910 --> 10:39.560
women also should
know everything about it.

10:39.820 --> 10:43.450
What is the chakras are,
how they work out

10:45.040 --> 10:50.140
and what are their results
are, how do we suffer

10:50.400 --> 10:52.620
because our chakras
are in danger.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.550
All this knowledge
is free to you.

10:56.020 --> 10:58.790
You don't have to pay for
this knowledge. Only thing,

10:59.060 --> 11:02.660
every day-to-day life, when you
start working out Sahaja Yoga,

11:02.960 --> 11:08.370
then you'll find that what I'm
saying is absolutely tangible.

11:08.660 --> 11:13.700
You can verify it. It is so.
It's not something in the air.

11:13.940 --> 11:17.520
It is absolutely there.
We can prove everything

11:17.760 --> 11:21.410
that we believe in and we
can show others also

11:21.680 --> 11:25.320
that this is the truth.
Is an absolute truth.

11:25.620 --> 11:27.810
We are not here to
spread some sort

11:28.100 --> 11:31.680
of a fanaticism or racialism
or anything like that,

11:31.960 --> 11:34.950
but we are here to combine
the whole world together

11:35.250 --> 11:39.550
under one understanding; that
we belong to one universe

11:39.830 --> 11:43.610
and we have one
universal religion.

11:44.060 --> 11:45.490
Now, people will ask
you then,

11:45.770 --> 11:48.190
"Have we to give up
your religion?"

11:48.450 --> 11:49.880
You don't have to tell them that
you have to give up your religion,

11:50.130 --> 11:52.910
don't have to say that. You don't
have to be hard with them at all.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.320
On the contrary, no, no, no,
nothing has to be done.

11:55.640 --> 12:00.180
You just come and take to Sahaja
Yoga and take to your spirit.

12:00.470 --> 12:04.070
Gradually it will start
opening out.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.270
It has happened with
all of you

12:06.520 --> 12:08.270
that first when you
came to Sahaja Yoga

12:08.570 --> 12:11.310
you were in a different
shape. Now gradually,

12:11.620 --> 12:13.210
you started opening
out, you matured

12:13.500 --> 12:16.200
and you understood
Sahaja Yoga very well.

12:16.480 --> 12:21.270
In the same way, you must
teach others in the same manner,

12:21.610 --> 12:26.380
with the same understanding,
compassion and love.

12:26.630 --> 12:29.790
Otherwise, normally people
think that somebody

12:30.090 --> 12:32.400
is to be condemned
all the time.

12:32.660 --> 12:36.800
Of course, some are people
who are under bad influence

12:37.080 --> 12:40.860
and you cannot get along
with them, but most of you

12:41.150 --> 12:45.340
should know that we have to get
more people into Sahaja Yoga

12:45.620 --> 12:51.870
through our compassion, love
and also lot of understanding

12:52.140 --> 12:58.400
about others' feelings. I've
found that even countries

12:58.730 --> 13:01.540
where have been Sahaja
Yoga for so many time,

13:01.850 --> 13:07.010
suddenly someone comes up
and starts giving trouble

13:07.310 --> 13:12.300
and becoming bhootish sort of
thing, you see, and misbehaving.

13:12.630 --> 13:16.670
Suddenly, it happens. Such a person,
you know, if it is informed,

13:16.920 --> 13:19.730
we can take him out of Sahaja
Yoga. We can cleanse him.

13:20.030 --> 13:22.710
But all of you must know
one thing for definite

13:23.000 --> 13:26.420
that you all have these
powers to cure yourself,

13:26.700 --> 13:28.920
improve yourself,
to help others.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.440
You can do everything
yourself.

13:31.740 --> 13:34.450
You all have these powers,
but the only thing

13:34.710 --> 13:36.760
is you have to be
sincere and honest.

13:37.100 --> 13:40.880
If you are not sincere and
honest, it will never work out.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.210
On the contrary, it will
boomerang on you.

13:44.510 --> 13:49.620
So, in Sahaja Yoga, it's very impor-
tant is the sincerity of purpose.

13:49.990 --> 13:52.690
You must have complete
sincerity of purpose

13:52.950 --> 13:58.210
that you are here to achieve your
own self-emancipation, first.

13:58.520 --> 14:05.670
And secondly, you are
here to help others.

14:06.890 --> 14:11.620
The people all along in the
whole world now require help.

14:11.930 --> 14:15.690
There's so many problems,
so many catastrophes,

14:16.030 --> 14:22.530
so many horrible things
we everyday know going on.

14:22.780 --> 14:25.400
So now we need people who
are solid, who are balanced,

14:25.660 --> 14:29.660
who are peaceful, who understand
what is right and what is wrong.

14:30.360 --> 14:31.980
But apart from that,
you should know

14:32.210 --> 14:35.870
that you have now entered
into the Kingdom of God.

14:36.100 --> 14:38.660
Many people will say, all right,
we were so religious,

14:38.890 --> 14:40.890
we were praying to Christ,
we were praying to this one,

14:41.120 --> 14:43.800
praying to that one.
What did we get?

14:44.070 --> 14:46.670
You cannot get it because
you are not connected.

14:46.930 --> 14:50.310
You have to be connected. Once
you are connected to that,

14:50.560 --> 14:54.310
then you will find that
things start sorting out.

14:54.590 --> 14:58.250
But sincerity is very important
and faith in yourself.

14:58.660 --> 15:02.480
You must have faith in yourself
that you're quite capable,

15:02.710 --> 15:07.000
quite capable person and
you can achieve

15:07.560 --> 15:11.810
a very high degree of awareness by
which you can work out many things.

15:12.040 --> 15:15.240
It doesn't matter from what sort
of background you come in.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.830
It doesn't matter from what sort
of country you come in,

15:18.090 --> 15:19.310
race anything.

15:19.580 --> 15:21.020
You all can do very well

15:21.270 --> 15:26.260
and we have seen this happening in
so many countries where we had

15:26.490 --> 15:33.340
no hope at all. For example,
a country like Russia,

15:34.130 --> 15:37.740
imagine, they've never
worshipped any God.

15:37.970 --> 15:41.000
They didn't know about God.
They were not allowed to know

15:41.250 --> 15:43.500
about any religion,
anything,

15:43.790 --> 15:47.620
but suddenly I went there, I don't
know, they recognized Me, suddenly.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.040
They just recognized Me and
just with My photograph

15:51.380 --> 15:53.590
I find them there. I was
amazed that the first time

15:53.890 --> 16:02.570
I went to Leningrad there were
two thousand seats in the hall,

16:02.940 --> 16:05.090
but outside they were
all standing. I said,

16:05.390 --> 16:07.020
"Why are they standing
outside?" They said,

16:07.290 --> 16:09.660
"All the seats are full, Mother,
and these are extra people.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.290
There are more than two
thousand outside." So I said,

16:13.610 --> 16:16.930
"This is too much." And so they
said, "Mother, what about us?"

16:17.240 --> 16:19.060
I said, "All right, let me
finish the program."

16:19.350 --> 16:21.990
I went inside, did the program,
everything happened

16:22.370 --> 16:23.420
and you'll be amazed

16:23.640 --> 16:27.140
when we had the program,
the people who were outside

16:27.440 --> 16:30.400
were still waiting. I gave
realization to people

16:30.660 --> 16:32.500
and they were waiting,
waiting, waiting.

16:32.770 --> 16:35.350
When I came out
I gave them.

16:36.050 --> 16:37.470
I said, "Now, what to do?

16:37.750 --> 16:39.880
I can't give you
realization just now."

16:40.160 --> 16:42.320
So they said, "All right,
what can we do?"

16:42.630 --> 16:44.500
I said, "Tomorrow morning
can you come?" They said,

16:44.800 --> 16:48.000
"All right." So all those who were
inside and those who were outside,

16:48.250 --> 16:51.210
all of them came and
came and sat down

16:51.490 --> 16:56.460
and that open ground and
I gave them realization.

16:56.740 --> 16:59.830
So this is the first beginning,
but now in Moscow

17:00.110 --> 17:05.860
or any place we have to
reserve a huge, big stadium.

17:06.220 --> 17:09.080
Fourteen to sixteen
thousand people are there

17:09.340 --> 17:13.000
and realization is
being given.

17:13.430 --> 17:16.020
But they are so quick
to accept Sahaja Yoga,

17:16.290 --> 17:20.710
so quick to accept Me, so quick
to understand Sahaja Yoga.

17:21.010 --> 17:26.230
I just can't imagine how these
Russians have got this capacity.

17:28.010 --> 17:29.760
No question of their
going back,

17:30.060 --> 17:32.410
no question of their
sincerity being challenged.

17:32.700 --> 17:38.530
There is no question of their
doubting themselves, nothing.

17:38.910 --> 17:43.380
Just there and so much so,
so much that I sometimes feel

17:43.700 --> 17:46.160
this democracy has
just harmed us.

17:46.630 --> 17:49.600
Because of democracy,of course,
we could do Sahaja Yoga all right,

17:49.880 --> 17:54.870
but where the people are,
absolutely sometimes very idiotic.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.680
Like in America, I find there's
very idiotic people live there

17:58.940 --> 18:03.500
and they were only busy
choosing their bathrooms

18:03.820 --> 18:08.080
and their curtains and their soaps
and all the time they will choose,

18:08.370 --> 18:10.820
only busy with all these
nonsensical things.

18:11.100 --> 18:17.740
They are so idiotic, while the
people in Russia are so sensible,

18:18.030 --> 18:24.810
so deep, so introspective and
even the artists and the scientists.

18:26.110 --> 18:30.580
I had a conference with the scientists.
There were about three hundred of them

18:30.990 --> 18:33.010
and I started talking to
them about science.

18:33.270 --> 18:34.520
I thought, better start
with science.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.430
They said, "Mother, no more
science, no more science.

18:36.730 --> 18:40.500
Tell us the science
of God."

18:42.130 --> 18:43.630
Such open-minded people.

18:43.870 --> 18:46.750
We have two hundred
doctors in Russia

18:47.050 --> 18:52.030
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga
and it has spread up to Siberia.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.510
Now, what's the use
of this democracy

18:57.770 --> 19:00.950
which doesn't take us to God.
It doesn't give us sense

19:01.220 --> 19:05.010
that we should seek God and
we should be humble towards God.

19:05.310 --> 19:09.240
So what's the use of having
this kind of a democracy and

19:09.550 --> 19:14.210
this kind of freedom which has
made us mad and idiotic?

19:14.620 --> 19:17.550
And that's very true about
every democratic country

19:17.830 --> 19:21.430
because you must know
democracy is money-oriented.

19:22.280 --> 19:25.600
And you know Greeks are very money
-oriented people also, as well.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.310
Of course, they're not
as bad as Americans,

19:28.600 --> 19:30.330
but they are quite
money-oriented.

19:30.620 --> 19:32.850
Also, Italians are very
money-oriented,

19:33.130 --> 19:35.540
but the worst is
the corruption.

19:36.060 --> 19:38.060
Now Italy is getting
exposed.

19:38.340 --> 19:40.480
I'm sure your country will
also get exposed.

19:40.760 --> 19:42.450
All these countries
are to be exposed.

19:42.720 --> 19:46.620
But, first of all, the Sahaja
Yogis have to be firm people.

19:47.180 --> 19:50.770
They have to be very, very
firm and they should know that

19:51.030 --> 19:53.340
Sahaja Yoga is only
spirit-oriented,

19:53.680 --> 19:55.480
nothing but
spirit-oriented,

19:55.750 --> 19:58.680
that you have to have
your spirit enlightened,

19:59.000 --> 20:02.190
that your spirit has
to work everything,

20:02.430 --> 20:06.040
that you are not this body,
this money, this position,

20:06.350 --> 20:09.890
these powers, nothing.
But you are the spirit.

20:10.230 --> 20:12.950
This is what one
has to know.

20:13.300 --> 20:16.670
I was told it is very
difficult for you

20:16.970 --> 20:20.500
to come for pujas
to Cabella

20:20.790 --> 20:24.420
you all cannot join,
but one week,

20:24.720 --> 20:28.360
supposing you take
during Guru Puja, I think.

20:28.640 --> 20:30.820
You can come by boat
or something like that,

20:31.110 --> 20:34.440
would be easier for you to
come to Genoa by boat

20:34.740 --> 20:37.610
and then we can organize
your coming down.

20:37.910 --> 20:41.350
For Guru Puja, you all should
come. You see, Sahasrara Puja

20:41.620 --> 20:45.050
and Guru Puja are
very important

20:45.350 --> 20:49.950
and if you could come for Guru
Puja, it would be a very nice idea.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.530
I think it can be
arranged and organized

20:52.830 --> 20:56.630
that you can come
to Guru Puja.

20:57.210 --> 21:00.200
I know it's wherever I am,

21:00.500 --> 21:04.870
supposing if I have it here, then
for all the rest of the people

21:05.180 --> 21:08.460
it will be far away. So
I just thought of Milan

21:08.750 --> 21:12.080
being quite in the center that
it would be nearer to England,

21:12.360 --> 21:14.790
nearer to other European
countries.

21:15.760 --> 21:18.430
You see, the Americans and
the South Americans

21:18.690 --> 21:21.510
find it very difficult,
so this time

21:21.830 --> 21:24.040
we had to provide all
tickets, everything

21:24.330 --> 21:27.830
to South Americans to come.
But they're very deep people.

21:28.110 --> 21:31.520
I was surprised in Colombia, they
are such good Sahaja Yogis,

21:31.800 --> 21:33.560
very beautiful
Sahaja Yogis.

21:33.880 --> 21:38.140
Very simple-hearted, very
good, well educated.

21:38.430 --> 21:42.880
Three, four of them got married
in India and they're very happy.

21:45.910 --> 21:52.890
So, now for that, two
things have to be done.

21:53.280 --> 22:00.730
Firstly, is that you
should come to collective.

22:01.030 --> 22:04.010
It's very important. You all
should come to collective

22:04.290 --> 22:08.450
and put your - please put attention
to Me, not to them, alright.

22:08.830 --> 22:10.780
Please put your attention
towards Me,

22:11.050 --> 22:12.700
don't turn your attention
very much.

22:12.980 --> 22:17.600
You have to keep your attention
all right. It's very important.

22:20.780 --> 22:25.060
So you have to one thing is
to do, is to come to the collective

22:25.320 --> 22:29.000
and watch out for your attention.
Where is your attention?

22:29.310 --> 22:31.850
Where are you looking? Are you
turning your head too much

22:32.140 --> 22:34.550
or are you putting your
attention straight?

22:34.810 --> 22:38.180
It's very important that you
must keep your attention

22:38.440 --> 22:41.810
absolutely wrapped and
towards the meetings

22:42.040 --> 22:47.550
that you have here for
your collective.

22:48.170 --> 22:51.650
In that way, when your
attention is fixed you'll find

22:51.890 --> 22:55.070
you'll definitely rise into
thoughtless awareness,

22:55.320 --> 22:57.590
a state where you
grow spiritually.

22:57.860 --> 23:01.770
You have to rise up to that
state of thoughtless awareness

23:02.020 --> 23:04.890
where you grow
spiritually.

23:05.200 --> 23:06.890
If you're not in thoughtless
awareness,

23:07.140 --> 23:09.860
you cannot grow in
your spirituality.

23:10.110 --> 23:14.220
So it's very important to
see where is your attention.

23:14.460 --> 23:16.480
Where are you putting
your attention?

23:16.740 --> 23:18.820
If the attention could
be controlled

23:19.110 --> 23:21.150
then things will
be all right.

23:21.420 --> 23:24.300
He is crying,
the child is crying,

23:24.620 --> 23:28.040
may be you can take
him outside a litle bit,

23:36.650 --> 23:42.040
he is feeling hot I think
is all right now with the mother

23:57.100 --> 23:59.230
So the first thing is to
be in the collective.

23:59.520 --> 24:06.440
Now it's a very sinister,
also idea of some people

24:06.710 --> 24:09.640
is to always break the
collective, to create problems,

24:09.930 --> 24:16.350
to disregard the leaders. As a
result, leaders also get so fed up,

24:16.640 --> 24:19.220
they give up, you see. They don't
want to have anything to do.

24:19.550 --> 24:23.990
So they put up their own ideas,
they try to trouble the leaders,

24:24.240 --> 24:28.530
they create problems for them, they
just try to show off everywhere,

24:28.800 --> 24:34.450
as if they know everything. All
such people also create groups.

24:34.750 --> 24:40.800
So beware about them. You should
stick on always to the collective

24:41.090 --> 24:46.780
and not to anyone who tries to
create a kind of a group at all

24:47.110 --> 24:52.670
or who troubles or who
makes things difficult.

24:53.240 --> 24:57.380
You must understand those who
are collective only will grow,

24:57.660 --> 25:02.750
those who aren't, will not grow.
Because like a nail, if it breaks,

25:03.030 --> 25:07.100
then it doesn't grow.
In the same manner,

25:07.410 --> 25:11.090
if you keep out of this
thing, by any chance,

25:11.420 --> 25:13.370
if you have any problems
with the leaders,

25:13.680 --> 25:15.310
you can always
write to Me,

25:15.630 --> 25:17.500
you can tell Me,
I can work it out.

25:17.810 --> 25:22.380
But all the time, to go on
like this and grouping

25:22.660 --> 25:25.580
like this will break and there
will be someone who'll do that.

25:25.840 --> 25:28.690
There will be some negative
person who'll try to do that.

25:28.940 --> 25:33.660
So, you have to be very careful
not to get out of the collective.

25:33.940 --> 25:36.340
You must always
support the collective,

25:36.590 --> 25:41.940
must help this collective
and must nourish it.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.970
As you know, I was
telling him also

25:46.260 --> 25:48.890
that he, if he has
problem with money,

25:49.190 --> 25:51.870
we can give money
from Cabella

25:52.170 --> 25:54.350
because before that I used
to travel on My own.

25:54.620 --> 25:58.540
Even to Greece, I came on
My own, and paid for everything.

25:58.800 --> 26:02.110
So, see also, then Stomatis
had to pay something,

26:02.420 --> 26:05.010
which I didn't like very much.
He was paying so much,

26:05.280 --> 26:07.090
because we had such
a small group.

26:07.360 --> 26:10.900
But now as you have a big
group, you feel responsible,

26:11.200 --> 26:13.520
you want to pay for it.
All right, doesn't matter.

26:13.820 --> 26:19.590
But not to pay for your Sahaja
Yoga, not for your realization,

26:19.860 --> 26:24.210
not for knowledge of Sahaja
Yoga. This is there.

26:24.490 --> 26:27.850
And so people will start putting
ideas into your heads that,

26:28.110 --> 26:30.170
Why this? Why that?",
and all that.

26:30.430 --> 26:33.280
Such people you should keep
out because you are here

26:33.560 --> 26:36.010
to develop your spirituality
and not to listen

26:36.280 --> 26:38.800
to these stupid people who
have been troublesome.

26:39.060 --> 26:42.310
So best is to keep
to your own,

26:43.000 --> 26:47.890
own development and own
nourishment. It's very important.

26:48.590 --> 26:52.280
So it is in a way collective,
but also individual,

26:52.560 --> 26:55.460
because what you're
gaining out of the collective

26:55.760 --> 26:57.990
you should be on the watch
out, you should see for yourself

26:58.290 --> 27:00.430
what you are gaining
out of the collective.

27:00.730 --> 27:03.250
Then secondly, at home, you
must every day, every day,

27:03.550 --> 27:07.370
every day, again I say,
not to miss it out,

27:07.690 --> 27:12.330
in the evening before sleeping
you must have meditation.

27:12.620 --> 27:15.120
You can wash
yourself up, like,

27:15.430 --> 27:17.390
what you call, the water
treatment or anything

27:17.660 --> 27:19.610
then sit down for meditation
for ten minutes.

27:19.920 --> 27:23.210
You must give fifteen minutes to
yourself and then sleep off.

27:23.500 --> 27:26.080
Supposing you can't do
one night, doesn't matter,

27:26.360 --> 27:29.710
but try to do it every
night. If not possible,

27:29.970 --> 27:32.160
if you don't do it one night,
you can do it in the morning.

27:32.460 --> 27:35.960
But it's very important. I can
easily make out a person

27:36.250 --> 27:39.490
who does meditation and
who does not do meditation.

27:39.870 --> 27:44.590
It's a difference, such a difference.
I immediately know a person

27:44.910 --> 27:49.810
who is meditating
everyday, in his health,

27:50.100 --> 27:54.630
in his face, in his behavior,
in everything, he's very different.

27:54.960 --> 27:58.130
And those who do not do
any meditation you'll find,

27:58.410 --> 28:02.330
not only that they are funny,
but their children are funny,

28:02.630 --> 28:06.510
their relationships are
funny, everything is funny.

28:06.860 --> 28:10.880
So the meditation is
a very important part for you.

28:11.300 --> 28:13.620
Because also the women
who are pregnant, when they,

28:13.920 --> 28:16.370
if they do not meditate
their children turn out

28:16.660 --> 28:21.430
to be very troublesome and very
funny. It's a thing like that.

28:21.780 --> 28:26.200
It effects everything. But your
character of meditativeness,

28:26.470 --> 28:32.250
your character of Sahaja Yoga
helps everyone, your children,

28:32.590 --> 28:34.920
your family, your society,
everybody,

28:35.180 --> 28:38.820
and everybody can make it out
what sort of a family you are,

28:39.130 --> 28:42.460
what sort of a people you are,
what sort of a personality you are.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.680
And from you they
take to Sahaja Yoga.

28:44.950 --> 28:50.620
So is important in individual life
also just to meditate, nothing else.

28:51.230 --> 28:55.930
You have to come to a state
of thoughtless awareness.

28:56.230 --> 28:58.780
So the mantra is, as
you know, Nirvichara.

28:59.030 --> 29:01.090
You should use the
mantra of Nirvichara

29:01.370 --> 29:03.550
for coming to the
state of thoughtlessness

29:03.810 --> 29:05.960
and try to increase
this area,

29:06.280 --> 29:08.160
this space of thoughtless
awareness

29:08.450 --> 29:12.540
and that is how you will find
you will be growing very much.

29:13.040 --> 29:17.060
Now as you get lots of powers,
as you get lots of people

29:17.390 --> 29:20.080
being realized by you,
curing by you,

29:20.330 --> 29:22.860
sometimes maybe it
might affect your ego.

29:23.110 --> 29:27.380
You might get into ego things.
For such people, I have to say

29:27.660 --> 29:30.660
that you have to be introspective
and see for yourself.

29:30.960 --> 29:33.480
You face the mirror and ask
now how much ego you have.

29:33.780 --> 29:36.940
Laugh at yourself. Once you
start laughing at yourself,

29:37.210 --> 29:39.670
your ego will drop out
and you'll understand

29:39.920 --> 29:43.920
that it was false to have this
kind of ego within you.

29:44.210 --> 29:47.450
There are so many ways and methods
of finding out about yourself.

29:47.740 --> 29:51.010
Put yourself into bandhan and put
your hands towards the photograph,

29:51.290 --> 29:53.720
immediately you can feel what
chakras are catching

29:54.030 --> 29:58.020
and you know how to clear it out.
Also sometimes you feel it inside.

29:58.290 --> 30:00.710
If your chakras are catching,
you can feel it inside

30:01.010 --> 30:06.100
and you can feel it,
the different centers

30:06.370 --> 30:08.720
on your fingertips
about yourself.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.390
So it is about yourself you will
know. About others, you know,

30:13.660 --> 30:15.760
you should just talk on
chakras. You should not say,

30:16.040 --> 30:18.940
he's bhootish, or he has ego
- nothing. But you should say,

30:19.200 --> 30:22.440
his Agnya is catching,
means he has got ego.

30:22.760 --> 30:25.720
You can say, his Nabhi's bad,
his, this thing is bad.

30:25.980 --> 30:27.650
So the language is
to change now.

30:27.920 --> 30:32.970
We have to talk in the
language of Sahaja Yoga.

30:33.670 --> 30:37.530
It is to be understood that
now we are Sahaja Yogis.

30:37.820 --> 30:41.050
We've got the powers
we have vibratory powers.

30:41.330 --> 30:45.950
But if you don't use these vibratory
powers, what is going to happen?

30:46.750 --> 30:48.760
We have to use them,
that's the point.

30:49.000 --> 30:51.190
We always forget. I've
seen, the other day

30:51.470 --> 30:53.320
they couldn't open something.
I said, "Give a bandhan."

30:53.600 --> 30:56.000
Gave a bandhan and immediately
it worked out, you see.

30:56.260 --> 30:58.230
Small, small things also
you'll be surprised

30:58.500 --> 31:00.330
that if it doesn't work out, you have
to just give a bandhan

31:00.570 --> 31:02.040
and it works out.

31:02.380 --> 31:04.740
It is important to know
that you are Sahaja Yogis,

31:05.030 --> 31:07.660
you are saints and that
you can do lots of things

31:07.940 --> 31:10.210
and you shouldn't forget it.
You shouldn't forget it

31:10.460 --> 31:13.480
that you are Sahaja Yogis. Now
you are no more ordinary people.

31:13.750 --> 31:16.270
You are saints now and
you can do a lot.

31:16.550 --> 31:20.520
All this, when it works out,
you'll be amazed at yourself how,

31:20.810 --> 31:23.690
how you have achieved
all these things.

31:24.020 --> 31:27.150
And, I tell you, people tell Me
that they look like roses,

31:27.430 --> 31:30.220
all of their faces shining,
they look so beautiful and

31:30.530 --> 31:32.580
they can make it out that
you are Sahaja Yogis.

31:32.890 --> 31:35.300
I've seen at the airport
also many people say that,

31:35.600 --> 31:36.990
"Who were those people

31:37.290 --> 31:42.160
looking so sweet and beautiful,
shining. Who were those?"

31:42.520 --> 31:45.230
So if I tell them that they
are saints, they won't believe

31:45.520 --> 31:47.980
that there could be so
many saints, but there are

31:48.250 --> 31:50.580
and we have achieved
that all over the world.

31:50.850 --> 31:53.150
All over the world now there
are so many Sahaja Yogis

31:53.430 --> 31:57.500
that I can't even say how many they
are, in thousands and thousands.

31:57.820 --> 31:59.980
So, I again tell
you that Greece

32:00.240 --> 32:02.310
is a place where
you can do a lot.

32:02.590 --> 32:05.610
First of all, you must establish
yourself in Sahaja Yoga

32:05.860 --> 32:09.030
and you have to
know what you are,

32:09.310 --> 32:11.750
all the time to remember what
you are. You are a Sahaja Yogi.

32:12.040 --> 32:14.250
Even to children, you have
to say, "You are a Sahaja Yogi,"

32:14.520 --> 32:17.290
so they also develop that
personality by which

32:17.600 --> 32:20.470
they behave properly and
they behave in a manner

32:20.780 --> 32:23.540
that a Sahaja Yogi
should behave.

32:24.650 --> 32:29.700
So all these things are just
the preliminaries of Sahaja Yoga,

32:29.980 --> 32:33.800
but I am sure you must be
getting my tapes from Cabella

32:34.040 --> 32:36.910
and you must be knowing
about all the deeper things

32:37.190 --> 32:39.660
about yourself and
about Sahaja Yoga.

32:39.940 --> 32:43.760
It's a new age
that has started.

32:44.070 --> 32:47.370
The other day I said that the
Satya Yuga has started now.

32:47.710 --> 32:50.100
So it will start exposing
all that is a-satya,

32:50.410 --> 32:53.040
which is whatever is false.
All those who are false people

32:53.340 --> 32:57.480
will be exposed and you'll
be amazed at the way

32:57.790 --> 33:02.190
things will work out. And it's
such a great time you are born

33:02.520 --> 33:05.640
and it's such a great thing that
you have come to Sahaja Yoga

33:05.920 --> 33:07.790
and that you have
got your realization

33:08.040 --> 33:10.060
and that you are
one of those

33:10.370 --> 33:15.330
who have to lift the whole of this
universe into a higher awareness.

33:15.620 --> 33:17.640
Of course, we can't say
how many will be saved.

33:17.920 --> 33:21.820
It's another point because
what I know about is that

33:22.100 --> 33:26.730
in the evolutionary portion,
supposing we came from chimpanzees,

33:27.000 --> 33:29.960
many were lost
in between, you know,

33:30.260 --> 33:34.010
and there are so many
chimpanzees now left

33:34.320 --> 33:36.950
and there's the middle,
the people were lost.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.180
In the same way, many
human beings may be lost

33:39.470 --> 33:43.540
because of their stupidity, because
of their self-destructive habits

33:43.820 --> 33:46.050
that they have formed.

33:46.410 --> 33:48.290
But your responsibility
is very great.

33:48.510 --> 33:51.400
Don't think, I am just mediocre.
I'm good for nothing.

33:51.650 --> 33:53.020
Never. Never think
like that.

33:53.300 --> 33:57.060
You are all saints and you
are capable of great things.

33:57.380 --> 33:59.900
May God bless you.

34:04.040 --> 34:06.980
So today they want to
do the puja of Athena

34:07.350 --> 34:10.210
And you will be surprised
that the names of Athena

34:10.500 --> 34:15.990
are exactly about the same as
that of the Goddess, of Adi Shakti.

34:16.280 --> 34:19.270
Is very surprising, they
have such beautiful names.

34:19.580 --> 34:23.500
But we can have hundred
and eight names of… today

34:23.750 --> 34:26.650
and you can read the
names and the meanings

34:26.920 --> 34:28.900
and they can
say the mantras.

34:29.200 --> 34:31.670
But first the children
have to wash My feet

34:31.940 --> 34:35.280
with Ganesha stuti,
you can sing

34:35.720 --> 34:37.460
Ganesha stuti.

34:37.780 --> 34:42.500
You've got some musical
instrument or not?

34:42.850 --> 34:45.830
Yes, yes.
You have.
