1
00:26:03,585 --> 00:26:07,203
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:26:14,092 --> 00:26:16,729
In the medical studies

3
00:26:17,352 --> 00:26:21,332
whatever we have discovered so far

4
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:25,522
is there already available.

5
00:26:39,652 --> 00:26:44,491
And whatever we can discover with human awareness

6
00:26:44,516 --> 00:26:46,634
has its own limitations.

7
00:26:57,569 --> 00:26:58,997
Supposing

8
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:08,374
it is said that

9
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:11,288
the human body does not accept

10
00:27:11,313 --> 00:27:16,383
any foreign thing into its being,

11
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:29,771
but when the foetus is implanted,

12
00:27:29,796 --> 00:27:33,052
then it is looked after, it's not thrown out,

13
00:27:33,077 --> 00:27:36,625
it's looked after and thrown out at the right time.

14
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:51,795
Also the role of acetylcholine and adrenaline in our body,

15
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,466
mode of action cannot be explained

16
00:27:54,491 --> 00:27:58,529
because sometimes they augment, sometimes they relax.

17
00:28:17,255 --> 00:28:20,263
We cannot even explain the action of our spleen,

18
00:28:20,288 --> 00:28:22,491
there are so many things that cannot be explained

19
00:28:22,516 --> 00:28:25,760
through medical achievements.

20
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:36,286
So we have to know there is much to be known

21
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:38,326
and much to be found out.

22
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:48,011
So I would like you all

23
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:52,594
to know something of the beyond which is not known so far.

24
00:28:58,326 --> 00:29:03,560
And for you I would request to have

25
00:29:04,753 --> 00:29:07,329
an open mind of a scientist

26
00:29:13,782 --> 00:29:16,819
to see for youself if it is true or not.

27
00:29:21,563 --> 00:29:24,027
Till then it's like a hypothesis.

28
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:32,191
So Sahaja Yoga gives you the complete picture,

29
00:29:32,412 --> 00:29:34,173
total picture,

30
00:29:34,467 --> 00:29:37,574
of the totality of consciousness.

31
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:49,790
And as you grow higher and higher in Sahaja Yoga you yourself

32
00:29:50,535 --> 00:29:57,776
understand and can work out this great system.

33
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,607
First we have to accept

34
00:30:07,632 --> 00:30:11,418
that we are not only this human body,

35
00:30:15,608 --> 00:30:17,558
nor our emotions,

36
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:23,321
and neither our ego and conditionings,

37
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:32,389
but we are the Spirit, the pure Spirit.

38
00:30:36,324 --> 00:30:39,007
The another thing one has to understand,

39
00:30:39,032 --> 00:30:42,504
that there is an all-pervading Power of Love

40
00:30:48,474 --> 00:30:53,475
which does all this living work of creating flowers,

41
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:57,317
creating fruits, making us human beings.

42
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:09,584
Of course in the science there is no place for love as such,

43
00:31:09,825 --> 00:31:12,739
it doesn't talk of love.

44
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:23,339
But even the doctors have to love their patients

45
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:25,948
otherwise they cannot dedicate.

46
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,540
So first the doctor has to become the Spirit

47
00:31:36,565 --> 00:31:40,116
and has to feel the cool vibrations around him,

48
00:31:40,141 --> 00:31:45,693
which are the proof of this all-pervading Power of Love.

49
00:31:58,553 --> 00:32:01,737
Now this is the instrument which you have to use,

50
00:32:01,762 --> 00:32:05,840
first of all for cleansing yourself and for cleansing others.

51
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:18,462
In the medical terminology we can say that

52
00:32:18,487 --> 00:32:22,683
the parasympathetic nervous system is looked after by the central channel

53
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:27,486
and the left and right is looked after by two more channels.

54
00:32:41,141 --> 00:32:42,821
According to Sahaja Yoga

55
00:32:42,846 --> 00:32:46,835
left and right sympathetic are two separate energies.

56
00:32:55,104 --> 00:32:57,904
The left one is the one which comforts us,

57
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,850
the right one is the one which counsels us

58
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:05,278
and the centre one is the one which redeems us.

59
00:33:19,615 --> 00:33:23,177
So all this is after Realization,

60
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:29,131
because you have to have the connection.

61
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:39,446
Now in human beings these centres are

62
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:42,788
in the spinal cord and also in the brain.

63
00:33:53,743 --> 00:33:55,743
And they are formed like this,

64
00:33:55,768 --> 00:33:57,602
from the left and from the right,

65
00:33:57,627 --> 00:34:00,294
both put together is the central system.

66
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:16,828
The triangular bone in which this Kundalini resides

67
00:34:17,324 --> 00:34:20,595
is called as Sacrum as you know.

68
00:34:28,326 --> 00:34:30,826
‘Sacrum’ means ‘sacred’

69
00:34:33,525 --> 00:34:35,545
so the Greeks knew about it

70
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:42,186
and they put that word in the medical terminology also, ‘sacred’.

71
00:34:48,673 --> 00:34:50,901
So according to Sahaja Yoga

72
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:55,526
we are actually basically three types of people.

73
00:35:02,447 --> 00:35:06,346
Firstly, either we go to the left or to the right.

74
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:14,541
Left side is our desires

75
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:19,101
that have worked out and also

76
00:35:19,312 --> 00:35:23,158
whatever doesn’t work out goes into our subconscious

77
00:35:23,282 --> 00:35:24,743
on the left side,

78
00:35:33,995 --> 00:35:36,529
and then into collective subconscious.

79
00:35:42,895 --> 00:35:46,136
We can say that it looks after our psyche.

80
00:35:50,353 --> 00:35:52,689
It starts from down below there,

81
00:35:52,811 --> 00:35:54,677
from the last centre,

82
00:35:54,824 --> 00:35:58,067
goes upward, crosses over at the optic chiasma

83
00:35:58,067 --> 00:36:01,670
and creates what you call as the superego

84
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:04,773
in the psychological terms,

85
00:36:04,798 --> 00:36:06,614
means the conditioning.

86
00:36:18,812 --> 00:36:23,866
The lowest centre also nourishes the pelvic plexus,

87
00:36:31,873 --> 00:36:34,473
which is responsible for our excretion.

88
00:36:38,826 --> 00:36:41,314
Also it looks after sex.

89
00:36:47,193 --> 00:36:51,986
So one has to have sane ideas about sex,

90
00:36:57,939 --> 00:37:04,811
because this channel originates from the last centre.

91
00:37:10,788 --> 00:37:15,000
But when Freud talked of psyche,

92
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,544
he perverted the whole thing.

93
00:37:26,548 --> 00:37:32,304
Instead of telling people how to safeguard this centre,

94
00:37:32,491 --> 00:37:38,556
how to safeguard the centre of innocence

95
00:37:39,844 --> 00:37:44,168
by looking after the sex habits,

96
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,912
he just told the other way round.

97
00:38:01,582 --> 00:38:04,568
He related everything to sex

98
00:38:04,593 --> 00:38:07,302
as if human beings are just sex points.

99
00:38:16,032 --> 00:38:22,626
And he formed a very funny self-opiniated ideology

100
00:38:22,651 --> 00:38:27,617
that every man has sex feelings for his mother. Horrible!

101
00:38:40,795 --> 00:38:44,645
On this mental projection he based all his theories

102
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,340
and people thought it was so-called ‘freedom’

103
00:38:55,365 --> 00:38:57,789
to have sex the way they like.

104
00:39:07,434 --> 00:39:09,500
They didn’t even challenge him.

105
00:39:09,577 --> 00:39:12,844
He became more than Christ to them in the West.

106
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,529
As a result we have now the invasion of AIDS,

107
00:39:28,177 --> 00:39:33,137
we have got all kinds of these diseases like gonorrhoea

108
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:35,331
and all these serious diseases,

109
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:41,560
which are, they say so, at least 60 percent in America.

110
00:39:50,606 --> 00:39:53,168
All related to sex organs.

111
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:01,586
It was always called as 'private', ‘private parts’,

112
00:40:01,611 --> 00:40:04,940
but it was never understood what does it mean.

113
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:20,651
Now so the left side is the psychic problem

114
00:40:25,373 --> 00:40:31,995
and the right side is the physical problems, somatic problems.

115
00:40:37,648 --> 00:40:43,705
Now the somatic problems are when we work too hard

116
00:40:44,737 --> 00:40:48,324
and think too much, we are futuristic,

117
00:40:48,479 --> 00:40:51,142
then we start using this centre,

118
00:40:59,724 --> 00:41:01,164
the second centre.

119
00:41:03,155 --> 00:41:04,835
When we think too much,

120
00:41:05,208 --> 00:41:09,842
then we have to supply energy for the brain.

121
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:20,320
So all the energy of this centre goes to such a brain

122
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:22,654
which thinks too much, which is futuristic.

123
00:41:28,675 --> 00:41:33,228
And other important functions it has to do,

124
00:41:33,228 --> 00:41:34,828
which are neglected.

125
00:41:43,714 --> 00:41:46,705
So the right-sided problems are caused by,

126
00:41:46,705 --> 00:41:49,637
neglect by liver, overactive liver.

127
00:41:54,676 --> 00:41:59,650
You get diabetes because pancreas is not looked after.

128
00:42:07,327 --> 00:42:12,779
You get leukemia because spleen is not looked after.

129
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:20,505
You get

130
00:42:22,313 --> 00:42:25,577
high blood pressure because kidneys are in trouble.

131
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:36,050
As the heat of the liver ascends you get asthma.

132
00:42:42,383 --> 00:42:46,211
We all know that the brain is like a spongy matter

133
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,202
and in a way coagulates.

134
00:43:01,977 --> 00:43:03,897
Same thing happens to kidneys

135
00:43:03,922 --> 00:43:07,005
when the heat goes to the kidneys.

136
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,848
They cannot pass the urine,

137
00:43:13,873 --> 00:43:17,018
the urine circulates in the body and in the blood.

138
00:43:23,385 --> 00:43:25,652
Also it causes constipation.

139
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:35,079
So heat is the symptom of disease

140
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:46,225
and coolness is the symptom of benevolence.

141
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:55,041
So

142
00:43:56,664 --> 00:43:59,554
they have experimented with helium gas

143
00:43:59,707 --> 00:44:03,126
and when they gave heat to helium

144
00:44:03,151 --> 00:44:07,503
they found out that all the molecules were fighting with each other.

145
00:44:17,581 --> 00:44:19,951
And when they cooled it,

146
00:44:20,512 --> 00:44:23,712
then they found all the molecules were collective.

147
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:35,104
Now the third type of diseases are psychosomatic,

148
00:44:35,129 --> 00:44:36,729
combination of both.

149
00:44:40,313 --> 00:44:42,727
But those who are psychosomatic

150
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:47,605
they have more problems with the psyche than with the physical.

151
00:44:55,057 --> 00:44:57,680
I'll explain to you about cancer,

152
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,847
which is psychosomatic according to us.

153
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:13,412
All these viruses are the dead plants or dead animals,

154
00:45:13,787 --> 00:45:15,227
maybe microscopic,

155
00:45:15,419 --> 00:45:18,747
which have gone out of the circulation of evolution.

156
00:45:29,802 --> 00:45:33,699
They reside in the area which we call as collective subconscious.

157
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:46,947
Doctors have reached the certain understanding about it,

158
00:45:46,972 --> 00:45:48,706
little certain understanding,

159
00:45:48,768 --> 00:45:52,072
that they say there are proteins 53 and 58,

160
00:45:52,072 --> 00:45:54,939
which trigger the cancer.

161
00:46:06,937 --> 00:46:10,539
Also they say that this

162
00:46:14,523 --> 00:46:19,490
cancer is caused to a person

163
00:46:19,895 --> 00:46:23,689
when he goes into some sort of a shock or something

164
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:28,769
and this attack comes from, triggering comes from

165
00:46:28,951 --> 00:46:34,618
the area which was built within us since our creation.

166
00:46:51,713 --> 00:46:54,146
This is the same area, which I'm telling you,

167
00:46:54,171 --> 00:46:57,854
is the collective subconscious where everything that is dead is there.

168
00:47:06,132 --> 00:47:09,360
So there are people, also human beings who are dead,

169
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,760
are hanging round there, dead souls.

170
00:47:16,123 --> 00:47:18,014
Now if I tell you something

171
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:21,239
which you may not have heard with medical science,

172
00:47:26,402 --> 00:47:28,580
but I'll give you the complete picture

173
00:47:28,605 --> 00:47:30,481
 in any case to understand.

174
00:47:34,037 --> 00:47:36,049
There is the soul

175
00:47:37,664 --> 00:47:41,987
which is made of causal of all the elements,

176
00:47:50,587 --> 00:47:55,418
which is attached in loops on the back side of our body,

177
00:48:06,624 --> 00:48:08,548
in all the seven centres

178
00:48:08,573 --> 00:48:12,164
plus the Sacrum bone where it resides.

179
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:20,495
It makes seven loops.

180
00:48:23,762 --> 00:48:25,122
I have told them,

181
00:48:25,147 --> 00:48:29,020
because after Realization you can see many loops like that,

182
00:48:29,045 --> 00:48:30,751
round round things in loop,

183
00:48:30,776 --> 00:48:33,512
you see them like chakras and one into another,

184
00:48:33,537 --> 00:48:36,573
many of them, sometimes together, sometimes only one.

185
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,663
Also you can see little sparks like commas,

186
00:48:47,688 --> 00:48:50,922
that is the Chaitanya, that is the vibrations.

187
00:49:00,231 --> 00:49:04,052
Now I have told them that these are the dead souls

188
00:49:04,222 --> 00:49:05,639
hanging around.

189
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:17,706
Now this soul is reflected on our cells in the receptor area.

190
00:49:27,066 --> 00:49:32,311
Recently, very recently in America they have now pictured

191
00:49:34,479 --> 00:49:36,621
the receptor of a cell.

192
00:49:44,765 --> 00:49:47,294
It exactly looks like the one

193
00:49:47,294 --> 00:49:50,558
you see after Realization in the air, exactly.

194
00:49:57,527 --> 00:50:02,032
But when another soul sits on the being

195
00:50:02,174 --> 00:50:05,064
then it is reflected on the cells.

196
00:50:08,301 --> 00:50:10,235
Dead soul, another dead soul.

197
00:50:20,216 --> 00:50:22,072
It affects the soul,

198
00:50:22,072 --> 00:50:28,228
it affects them because it is reflected in the cell,

199
00:50:28,253 --> 00:50:34,191
it is also affects the receptor.

200
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,617
Then this soul, new soul, which is there,

201
00:50:46,642 --> 00:50:49,885
it might get attached to anyone of the centres

202
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:55,207
or to all of them depends on affects the cells also.

203
00:51:07,645 --> 00:51:11,383
And they create all this dopamine series

204
00:51:11,408 --> 00:51:15,615
which causes epilepsy, mental problems,

205
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,317
also cancer, also AIDS, also all these things.

206
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:32,188
So if they are viruses, then it’s not so bad,

207
00:51:32,213 --> 00:51:35,309
I mean only one portion can be affected,

208
00:51:35,334 --> 00:51:38,533
but it can travel from one to another.

209
00:51:46,031 --> 00:51:51,557
But if it’s a human possession then it’s very difficult.

210
00:52:00,324 --> 00:52:04,546
So now in Sahaja Yoga to cure the diseases

211
00:52:04,546 --> 00:52:06,479
which you are giving me here,

212
00:52:07,147 --> 00:52:10,383
out of which I'll give it out to you is:

213
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:14,017
hypertension can be caused both of them,

214
00:52:14,034 --> 00:52:17,118
heart disease could be also from the same.

215
00:52:17,118 --> 00:52:19,700
Epilepsy definitely from the left side.

216
00:52:19,835 --> 00:52:23,163
Migraine or sick headaches could be from both sides.

217
00:52:28,752 --> 00:52:30,690
All these bone diseases...

218
00:52:30,934 --> 00:52:35,529
Is this like, what you call, arthritis?

219
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:39,033
It is this also is psychosomatic.

220
00:52:39,058 --> 00:52:41,525
Leukemia is definitely psychosomatic,

221
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:43,437
tumours are psychosomatic,

222
00:52:43,462 --> 00:52:46,461
women diseases, fibrosis, menopause...

223
00:52:46,685 --> 00:52:53,819
menopause is not a disease, it’s a normal thing.

224
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,622
Inflammation of the pancreas could be also psychosomatic.

225
00:53:14,054 --> 00:53:17,817
Cholecystitis need not be, need not be,

226
00:53:17,988 --> 00:53:20,316
it is, it can be somatic also.

227
00:53:22,548 --> 00:53:26,810
No, actually cholecystitis is left-sided, is left-sided, sorry.

228
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:44,735
Sciatica could be both, could be psychosomatic, could be somatic.

229
00:53:48,957 --> 00:53:52,346
All mental diseases — left-sided, absolutely.

230
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:55,391
Schizophrenia — absolutely.

231
00:53:55,797 --> 00:54:01,174
Alcoholism is created by right side, creating left side problems.

232
00:54:04,358 --> 00:54:06,838
Arthritis — psychosomatic.

233
00:54:08,084 --> 00:54:11,390
Varicosity is right-sided.

234
00:54:14,139 --> 00:54:17,162
Now bad habits, like drug addiction, smoking,

235
00:54:17,309 --> 00:54:21,643
homo sexuality and all kind of perverted sex,

236
00:54:22,182 --> 00:54:25,830
too much indulgence into sex is all due to psychosomatic,

237
00:54:25,885 --> 00:54:28,352
or left-sided, absolutely left-sided.

238
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:36,465
See, drug addiction, smoking...

239
00:54:37,572 --> 00:54:40,669
smoking creates left side problem

240
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:45,227
because one feels guilty.

241
00:54:49,147 --> 00:54:56,209
But we can say, perverted sex habits

242
00:55:00,703 --> 00:55:04,262
and flirting of the eyes,

243
00:55:12,441 --> 00:55:13,944
and AIDS,

244
00:55:17,586 --> 00:55:20,345
and what you call,

245
00:55:21,137 --> 00:55:22,874
too much of sex,

246
00:55:26,341 --> 00:55:27,922
or rigidity,

247
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:38,360
and also interest in, I've said, 
perverted sex you call that,

248
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:41,054
all this is due to the left side,

249
00:55:41,393 --> 00:55:45,068
is some sort of a possession.

250
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:56,418
Infantile paralysis is left-sided, same thing,

251
00:55:56,443 --> 00:56:01,168
multiple sclerosis absolutely this left, this centre.

252
00:56:05,245 --> 00:56:08,637
We cured the other day one lady of multiple sclerosis

253
00:56:08,646 --> 00:56:12,038
in about ten minutes and she started walking so fast.

254
00:56:20,169 --> 00:56:22,563
Then, what is there, neurosis —

255
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:26,577
neurosis could be from both the sides

256
00:56:27,053 --> 00:56:28,592
[UNCLEAR]

257
00:56:32,665 --> 00:56:37,861
Parkinson’s also from the same, left side.

258
00:56:38,535 --> 00:56:44,532
Rheumatism is the Nabhi, left side.

259
00:56:45,512 --> 00:56:47,968
Muscular dystrophy also left side.

260
00:56:51,605 --> 00:56:53,368
Stroke could be depends on:

261
00:56:53,393 --> 00:56:56,826
if it is on the left-hand side, then it is from the somatic side;

262
00:56:56,851 --> 00:57:00,495
if it is on the right-hand side, then it is from the left side.

263
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:16,284
Then there is yuppie’s disease —

264
00:57:20,149 --> 00:57:24,035
yuppie’s disease is where you are very hard working,

265
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,682
you are extremely futuristic

266
00:57:26,707 --> 00:57:29,854
and use your conscious mind too much,

267
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,559
studying too much also.

268
00:57:41,122 --> 00:57:44,514
Then the conscious mind becomes absolutely paralyzed.

269
00:57:49,189 --> 00:57:51,151
You are walking all right

270
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:54,437
and suddenly you are conscious that you are walking —

271
00:57:54,462 --> 00:57:56,183
you just paralyzed.

272
00:58:01,695 --> 00:58:06,649
I had told about yuppie’s disease about eight years back in America,

273
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:08,488
that it will come.

274
00:58:08,729 --> 00:58:10,663
But they didn't listen to Me.

275
00:58:17,508 --> 00:58:20,108
Now it is a very, very serious disease,

276
00:58:21,557 --> 00:58:22,778
very serious

277
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:29,088
and it's fast spreading, very fast spreading.

278
00:58:30,925 --> 00:58:35,800
I told them about AIDS about I think

279
00:58:36,571 --> 00:58:38,456
fourteen years back.

280
00:58:43,742 --> 00:58:45,487
They laughed at Me.

281
00:58:47,215 --> 00:58:48,735
Now they are in it.

282
00:58:51,932 --> 00:58:55,616
Diabetes is partly, very partly

283
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:58,477
we should say left, but mostly right.

284
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,957
Cancer is, any cancer is like this:

285
00:59:05,982 --> 00:59:10,848
you see, this is the centre and centre is giving energy on both the sides.

286
00:59:19,498 --> 00:59:24,532
And when you move one too much,

287
00:59:24,557 --> 00:59:27,458
because of using left or right, specially right,

288
00:59:27,483 --> 00:59:29,550
when you use too much of right,

289
00:59:29,577 --> 00:59:32,199
the exhaustion takes place [UNCLEAR].

290
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,140
So you are vulnerable.

291
00:59:47,532 --> 00:59:51,721
And suddenly happens from the left side, it breaks.

292
00:59:55,853 --> 00:59:59,218
And the connection with the whole is lost.

293
01:00:03,698 --> 01:00:07,348
So these proteins, like 53, 58,

294
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:09,659
they are very ego-oriented

295
01:00:16,161 --> 01:00:17,730
and arbitrary.

296
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:25,800
Whatever cell they touch, that becomes malignant.

297
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:34,456
Thus, malignancy is set in.

298
01:00:38,044 --> 01:00:40,511
Same women suffer from breast cancer.

299
01:00:44,835 --> 01:00:47,262
The centre of heart

300
01:00:49,485 --> 01:00:51,296
is the Mother’s centre.

301
01:00:55,971 --> 01:00:58,871
When the motherhood is challenged of a woman,

302
01:00:58,963 --> 01:01:03,357
supposing the husband has flirt and he keeps her always insecure,

303
01:01:14,983 --> 01:01:19,211
or she’s very much sort of insecure otherwise also

304
01:01:19,573 --> 01:01:22,628
then this centre gets tarnished.

305
01:01:31,042 --> 01:01:35,274
Now this centre produces antibodies to fight the diseases

306
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:38,267
in the sternum bone as you all know

307
01:01:42,529 --> 01:01:44,546
till the age of twelve years.

308
01:01:49,943 --> 01:01:52,600
And then they are distributed all over.

309
01:01:56,430 --> 01:02:00,073
So whenever there is any fear the sternum bone shakes

310
01:02:00,098 --> 01:02:02,098
and it's like a remote control

311
01:02:02,157 --> 01:02:06,316
and sends messages to all the antibodies to fight.

312
01:02:20,872 --> 01:02:25,870
So if you can establish the security of such a lady

313
01:02:27,113 --> 01:02:30,863
through Kundalini awakening, nourishing her centre here,

314
01:02:30,888 --> 01:02:32,684
her cancer can be cured.

315
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,360
When they are in very advance stages,

316
01:02:46,995 --> 01:02:51,103
they do not have that will-power left.

317
01:02:56,958 --> 01:03:01,502
Then it’s better to remove the breast and then establish your security.

318
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:14,815
Already there are diseases also

319
01:03:14,879 --> 01:03:20,054
which are caused by the lethargic organs.

320
01:03:25,523 --> 01:03:28,282
When heart is lethargic you get angina.

321
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:39,483
When this centre of Vishuddhi catches on the left side here,

322
01:03:39,508 --> 01:03:41,055
when you feel guilty,

323
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:45,715
then the blood cannot flow to the head,

324
01:03:54,935 --> 01:03:57,121
then it has to work very hard

325
01:04:00,731 --> 01:04:04,437
and such a heart becomes tired and lethargic.

326
01:04:09,235 --> 01:04:13,250
So in Sahaja Yoga we have two types of organs:

327
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:16,505
one are overactive and one are lethargic.

328
01:04:26,393 --> 01:04:29,860
It's lucky that the photograph also have vibrations.

329
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:40,346
So the doctors should first of all establish themselves properly,

330
01:04:40,371 --> 01:04:42,051
cleanse themselves nicely

331
01:04:49,181 --> 01:04:50,919
and protect themselves,

332
01:04:52,905 --> 01:04:56,071
then they can also learn how to cure others.

333
01:04:59,606 --> 01:05:02,418
But in the beginning, you can use the photographs

334
01:05:02,443 --> 01:05:06,421
and with the photographs how to cure you can find out from the centres,

335
01:05:15,594 --> 01:05:18,515
for every, left side or right side,

336
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,855
there are only three types: left side, right side or psychosomatic.

337
01:05:32,716 --> 01:05:34,744
But as I told you,

338
01:05:34,927 --> 01:05:39,259
that psychosomatic is first has to be dealt only on the left side.

339
01:05:45,533 --> 01:05:49,286
I think I've dealt with many diseases

340
01:05:50,904 --> 01:05:54,138
and if you have any other problems

341
01:05:54,673 --> 01:05:58,001
you should let me know what is to be done.

342
01:05:58,026 --> 01:05:59,975
There is one more, I must say,

343
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:06,583
that I've seen some children suffering from hyperactivity.

344
01:06:21,203 --> 01:06:26,566
Even diabetes comes from the same reason of a children.

345
01:06:27,032 --> 01:06:31,832
Children get diabetes with the same disease of which I'm telling.

346
01:06:36,685 --> 01:06:41,068
At the time when the mother is pregnant,

347
01:06:41,346 --> 01:06:44,399
she should not work very hard.

348
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:46,377
She should take rest more.

349
01:06:54,179 --> 01:06:56,985
She should not think too much

350
01:06:57,010 --> 01:07:02,117
but read something soothing things, something nice.

351
01:07:10,972 --> 01:07:13,032
Best is to meditate.

352
01:07:14,706 --> 01:07:17,106
At that time if mother is overactive

353
01:07:17,131 --> 01:07:19,664
and thinking of the futuristic things,

354
01:07:19,689 --> 01:07:22,223
children are born with these diseases.

355
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:34,314
And if she’s hectic,

356
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:37,271
the child may get leukemia

357
01:07:46,632 --> 01:07:50,024
because you know spleen will use for all emergencies,

358
01:07:50,049 --> 01:07:52,783
because it produces red blood corpuscles.

359
01:08:02,425 --> 01:08:05,708
But you are hectic, panicked all the time,

360
01:08:06,835 --> 01:08:11,121
rushing about, then poor spleen doesn't understand.

361
01:08:22,953 --> 01:08:27,306
It becomes erratic and also it becomes crazy I must say.

362
01:08:32,403 --> 01:08:36,568
This could be for even grownups, same thing.

363
01:08:37,594 --> 01:08:39,594
This is also for the grownups.

364
01:08:42,002 --> 01:08:47,461
Now when suddenly something triggers from the left side

365
01:08:47,587 --> 01:08:51,119
as a shock maybe, as some sort of a sadness,

366
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,339
maybe accident, anything,

367
01:09:02,662 --> 01:09:04,549
it triggers leukemia,

368
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:10,678
as well as in the children.

369
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:16,694
But the worst thing that is very difficult

370
01:09:17,221 --> 01:09:19,474
for anybody to understand

371
01:09:19,629 --> 01:09:23,713
is there are negative forces working.

372
01:09:30,913 --> 01:09:33,179
They work through negative people.

373
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,291
These can come as false gurus

374
01:09:40,316 --> 01:09:45,093
or some parapsychology or mesmerism,

375
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:47,161
anything like that.

376
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:59,586
All these things are done

377
01:09:59,611 --> 01:10:04,352
through putting some sort of a dead soul on your soul.

378
01:10:11,628 --> 01:10:14,249
So one has to be very careful.

379
01:10:17,131 --> 01:10:19,808
For this you cannot charge money

380
01:10:19,833 --> 01:10:22,608
because it's a living process of evolution.

381
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:32,446
Anything living: for example, you sow the seed —

382
01:10:32,471 --> 01:10:35,767
you don’t pay any money to Mother Earth, she does it.

383
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:45,498
It is built in the seed as well as the Mother Earth.

384
01:10:45,523 --> 01:10:47,052
You don't pay anything.

385
01:10:52,553 --> 01:10:55,668
We also take all the living processes for granted

386
01:10:55,693 --> 01:10:57,343
without thinking about it.

387
01:11:03,372 --> 01:11:05,052
There’s no obligation.

388
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:12,123
But all these horrible people are money-oriented.

389
01:11:19,874 --> 01:11:22,774
They have no purity of heart, purity of eyes.

390
01:11:26,402 --> 01:11:29,112
They are interested in women or men,

391
01:11:29,137 --> 01:11:31,870
all kinds of thing, dirty things they do.

392
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,379
The most important thing

393
01:11:39,404 --> 01:11:42,428
they cannot explain how they do it.

394
01:11:51,561 --> 01:11:54,413
They cannot relate it to medical science

395
01:11:58,700 --> 01:12:01,118
or to any science.

396
01:12:03,797 --> 01:12:07,061
Now there are some people who are trying to market,

397
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:11,286
marketing in Ayurveda. This is another trick.

398
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:19,777
That's the Indian system medical.

399
01:12:22,431 --> 01:12:27,318
Firstly, there is no need to have any guru for that,

400
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:29,743
you can always get it in the market.

401
01:12:36,438 --> 01:12:41,845
But these medicines are made out of absolutely fresh leaves,

402
01:12:42,116 --> 01:12:46,902
fresh roots, everything fresh, that only grows in India.

403
01:12:46,927 --> 01:12:48,372
Fruits, fresh fruits.

404
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:00,978
For example, you people take Liv 52 here,

405
01:13:01,003 --> 01:13:04,298
is made from a little fruit

406
01:13:04,323 --> 01:13:07,680
we call as aronya in India, from that, aronya.

407
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:26,792
So if you eat for a week aronya your liver is all right,

408
01:13:26,817 --> 01:13:29,306
you don't have to take this Liv 52 all your life.

409
01:13:37,182 --> 01:13:39,665
And they are very limited, few,

410
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:42,762
but there are some medicines which are very few,

411
01:13:42,787 --> 01:13:46,099
which are there, which can be helpful,

412
01:13:52,789 --> 01:13:57,040
which can be also made into pills and could be selled.

413
01:13:57,881 --> 01:13:59,783
Could be make into pills.

414
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:11,053
Next time I'll try to bring some for you.

415
01:14:13,159 --> 01:14:17,011
But the best way is Sahaja Yoga, is your own power.

416
01:14:21,343 --> 01:14:25,311
If you need any additional help then we do use vibrated water,

417
01:14:25,455 --> 01:14:29,080
vibrated sugar, vibrated salt

418
01:14:29,304 --> 01:14:33,299
and also we use certain these medicines little vibrated.

419
01:14:35,129 --> 01:14:37,341
Very, very, very few.

420
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:47,595
And also Hatha Yoga, some exercises we tell you

421
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:49,954
whenever it is necessary, very few.

422
01:14:57,377 --> 01:15:03,846
Like wherever there is a chakra damaged

423
01:15:03,846 --> 01:15:06,242
because of some physical problem,

424
01:15:06,242 --> 01:15:12,403
we try to give that particular Hatha Yoga exercise, precisely.

425
01:15:21,116 --> 01:15:23,281
But the way people do Hatha Yoga

426
01:15:23,306 --> 01:15:27,566
is taking all the medicines from the medicine chest,

427
01:15:27,591 --> 01:15:30,394
without knowing what to take, what not to take.

428
01:15:39,563 --> 01:15:41,630
Actually it is not Hatha Yoga —

429
01:15:41,655 --> 01:15:44,235
Ha Tha, means both the Nadis have to be used,

430
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:46,068
it's only Ha they use.

431
01:15:53,193 --> 01:15:56,265
And this can cause such an imbalance within you,

432
01:15:56,307 --> 01:16:00,081
that [UNCLEAR] can become extremely dry,

433
01:16:05,725 --> 01:16:09,717
hot tempered and may divorce his wife,

434
01:16:09,749 --> 01:16:12,078
may not produce any children.

435
01:16:20,667 --> 01:16:24,652
Now the women who are very right-sided, over right-sided,

436
01:16:24,677 --> 01:16:27,577
very left-sided also cannot produce children.

437
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:39,588
And they have so many problems otherwise.

438
01:16:44,086 --> 01:16:47,801
So that means is that we have to be in the centre,

439
01:16:51,488 --> 01:16:54,159
our Kundalini should be fixed permanently

440
01:16:54,184 --> 01:16:56,455
with that all-pervading Power

441
01:17:00,345 --> 01:17:03,353
and the flow should be all the time within you.

442
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,168
But apart from physical, mental and emotional life,

443
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:13,344
you have the spiritual life,

444
01:17:20,502 --> 01:17:22,926
which is much more miraculous,

445
01:17:27,052 --> 01:17:28,878
which is very blissful

446
01:17:31,832 --> 01:17:36,361
and when you understand how this power of Love looks after you,

447
01:17:36,429 --> 01:17:37,970
you are amazed.

448
01:17:49,568 --> 01:17:51,768
You don't worry about anything.

449
01:17:55,392 --> 01:17:58,126
That's what doctor Wallace told about Me,

450
01:17:58,151 --> 01:18:00,941
that he cannot cope with Me.

451
01:18:00,981 --> 01:18:04,583
But the main thing is I don't do anything.

452
01:18:10,142 --> 01:18:13,641
If I'm travelling I'm there, if I'm with you I'm here,

453
01:18:13,665 --> 01:18:15,261
so what am I doing?

454
01:18:22,434 --> 01:18:24,643
So I don't think I do anything.

455
01:18:27,112 --> 01:18:29,683
My love just flows, that's all,

456
01:18:29,708 --> 01:18:31,770
I know that it flows, that's all,

457
01:18:31,795 --> 01:18:33,422
but I don't do anything.

458
01:18:39,037 --> 01:18:41,225
Because that is My nature.

459
01:18:48,832 --> 01:18:51,904
That's how it is going to work out with you all,

460
01:18:51,929 --> 01:18:55,139
but I will advise you first not to touch the patient,

461
01:18:55,164 --> 01:18:56,812
use the photograph.
