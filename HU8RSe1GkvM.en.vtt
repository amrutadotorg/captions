WEBVTT

00:02.960 --> 00:07.480
So today in the city of Vancouver,

00:10.000 --> 00:15.080
we have gathered here to pray for

00:19.400 --> 00:23.240
the country of Canada,

00:23.720 --> 00:27.440
and also for the Canadian people.

00:29.720 --> 00:33.920
Also we have to know that,

00:34.600 --> 00:38.040
there are lots of negative forces working,

00:38.480 --> 00:41.880
and there has to be some

00:42.840 --> 00:46.920
puja to be done to the Mahakali Force.

00:47.200 --> 00:51.960
And so I thought today: ‘Let’s have the puja for Mahakali’.

00:52.760 --> 00:55.920
So Mahakali Puja is the same as you

00:56.120 --> 00:59.320
do the Devi’s Puja,

00:59.600 --> 01:02.920
but first the Mahakali Force came on this Earth.

01:03.120 --> 01:05.320
Adi Shakti came as Mahakali

01:05.520 --> 01:08.800
and created Shri Ganesha.

01:09.880 --> 01:13.960
Then She ascended as Mahasaraswati,

01:14.560 --> 01:18.440
and with that Force She created the whole universe.

01:19.880 --> 01:23.920
In that She created this world,

01:25.360 --> 01:29.440
in a very beautiful manner, with great

01:29.640 --> 01:32.840
arrangements and organizing

01:33.120 --> 01:35.120
and on that were born human beings

01:35.320 --> 01:38.240
because the temperature and all that was made

01:38.480 --> 01:41.840
very congenial for human beings.

01:44.760 --> 01:48.960
So this climate has also

01:49.440 --> 01:52.560
played a big part on the temperament of the people,

01:52.760 --> 01:55.000
on the seeking of the people.

01:55.200 --> 01:58.480
Like in India we can say,

01:59.200 --> 02:04.000
the climate is very congenial for meditation.

02:04.720 --> 02:08.080
It is been a traditional country

02:08.320 --> 02:10.040
from ancient times,

02:10.480 --> 02:11.760
but from the very beginning

02:11.960 --> 02:15.000
we have had seers who were seeking the Truth,

02:15.240 --> 02:16.720
in the jungles.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.400
The reason is this that,

02:19.600 --> 02:22.800
in India its climate is so good

02:23.000 --> 02:25.640
that you can live in a jungle, no problem.

02:25.920 --> 02:29.000
So it was easy for them to get rid of

02:29.240 --> 02:32.280
all the superficialities of life and

02:32.480 --> 02:34.840
to take seriously – go to the jungles,

02:35.040 --> 02:37.680
dedicate themselves

02:37.880 --> 02:40.240
for finding out the Truth.

02:40.440 --> 02:43.680
And thus they found out the Truth, that it is the Kundalini

02:43.880 --> 02:45.680
which is the Force within us

02:45.920 --> 02:48.840
which gives us Realization.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.800
But this group,

02:53.080 --> 02:55.760
then scattered in different places

02:55.960 --> 02:57.680
and they formed schools,

02:57.880 --> 03:01.160
were called, or universities, called as gotras,

03:01.800 --> 03:05.920
and in these schools were sent children from the age of five years.

03:06.160 --> 03:08.720
Five years they lived with their parents and then

03:08.920 --> 03:10.840
these children were sent there.

03:11.120 --> 03:14.320
And they were given all the education

03:14.720 --> 03:18.440
about day-to-day life.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.640
Their education system was very different.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.720
By their education they made the children

03:24.920 --> 03:29.160
very aware about everything, concentration,

03:29.360 --> 03:32.280
and a complete celibacy

03:32.480 --> 03:36.040
because all the people in a gotra could not marry.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.840
Even today supposing I belong to one gotra,

03:39.040 --> 03:41.720
I cannot marry a person in the same gotra.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.800
So it is so much maintained even today.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.640
Like in the university you cannot marry each other.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.240
So the children were kept like brothers and sisters

03:50.440 --> 03:54.320
and they felt it all the time, brothers and sisters feeling.

03:55.480 --> 03:58.720
In the same way, you see,

03:59.240 --> 04:00.680
it has worked out in many ways

04:00.880 --> 04:04.720
that the Mooladhara chakra was established very strongly in India,

04:04.960 --> 04:07.440
and that’s why,

04:07.960 --> 04:10.880
though we had many other countries like China,

04:11.080 --> 04:14.360
we had old China was there and also Egypt,

04:14.560 --> 04:18.680
then we had Greece and also Rome.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.960
All these countries did not pay much attention

04:22.160 --> 04:24.320
to their Mooladhara chakra

04:24.520 --> 04:27.280
and this Mooladhara was created

04:27.480 --> 04:29.760
by the Mahakali Power.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.720
Mahakali created Shri Ganesha

04:32.960 --> 04:37.400
to emit holiness, auspiciousness, wisdom,

04:37.720 --> 04:39.280
Divine wisdom;

04:39.480 --> 04:42.160
and Her establishment of Shri Ganesha

04:42.360 --> 04:45.200
is also within us on the Mooladhara chakra.

04:45.480 --> 04:49.200
But, if we do not pay attention to our Mooladhara chakra,

04:49.400 --> 04:51.600
then our powers become very weak

04:51.800 --> 04:54.960
and we start catching from negativity much more.

04:55.200 --> 05:00.520
Those who have good Mooladharas do not catch, so fast.

05:00.760 --> 05:03.640
But we catch, we are harmed more by people

05:03.840 --> 05:05.160
who are negative

05:05.400 --> 05:08.160
because they know that we have bad Mooladharas

05:08.360 --> 05:10.840
and they can affect us.

05:11.040 --> 05:14.600
Now all the gurus and all those false gurus came to

05:14.960 --> 05:18.360
western countries because they knew they can affect much more here,

05:18.560 --> 05:20.080
than in India.

05:20.280 --> 05:22.440
Like Rajneesh, nobody would accept such a man.

05:22.640 --> 05:25.240
Freud, nobody would accept such a person.

05:25.480 --> 05:28.760
But here already Freud has done the

05:29.000 --> 05:34.080
necessary harm to people and they were prepared to become,

05:36.440 --> 05:38.560
vulnerable to these people,

05:38.800 --> 05:41.440
and on that background these people came here

05:41.640 --> 05:43.840
and started

05:44.080 --> 05:47.160
acting and they have been very successful.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.320
All of them

05:49.560 --> 05:53.560
have been found out to be very loose character

05:53.760 --> 05:55.360
and they are being exposed

05:55.560 --> 05:58.120
and it’s nice that whatever is negative,

05:58.320 --> 06:00.600
whatever is false gets exposed.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.080
But still one has to remember that

06:03.320 --> 06:05.120
if we have a strong Mooladhara

06:05.320 --> 06:08.360
then Mahakali Power is the strongest within us,

06:08.560 --> 06:13.320
because as I told you, first She created Shri Ganesha.

06:13.520 --> 06:17.400
So all Her Power are actually expressed in Aumkara

06:17.600 --> 06:19.640
which is Shri Ganesh.

06:19.840 --> 06:24.400
And this Shri Ganesh Power within us represents

06:24.640 --> 06:26.760
the complete love of Mahakali

06:26.960 --> 06:31.320
and all Her Powers of destroying the evil forces.

06:31.520 --> 06:37.320
They go hand-in-hand we should say like, every

06:38.240 --> 06:43.000
light has its glory around it, or glow around it.

06:43.440 --> 06:48.360
In the same way the light of Mahakali

06:48.560 --> 06:51.800
has the glow, as chaitanya,

06:52.000 --> 06:55.640
which is actually nothing but Aumkara

06:55.840 --> 06:58.040
and Shri Ganesha.

06:58.520 --> 07:02.440
Now Shri Ganesha has aspects, as I have told them,

07:02.640 --> 07:06.600
that if you see the carbon from the left,

07:06.800 --> 07:08.880
you see on the right side Aumkara,

07:09.080 --> 07:10.560
Aum, written like that.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.840
If you see from right to the left,

07:13.040 --> 07:15.520
you see it as swastika.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.040
If you see from down below upward,

07:18.240 --> 07:19.880
then you see it as a cross.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.560
And now they have verified it, they have experimented,

07:22.760 --> 07:24.480
and the scientists have found out

07:24.680 --> 07:28.160
and have now declared that it is so.

07:29.280 --> 07:33.200
So that aspect of Aumkara which is within us is the right side.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.840
But the left side is the swastika.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.720
And the swastika is a very, very

07:38.920 --> 07:42.880
sensitive instrument that if you use it

07:43.120 --> 07:46.520
on the right side then of course

07:46.840 --> 07:48.320
it is all right,

07:48.520 --> 07:52.240
it works for construction; but if you use it for left side,

07:52.440 --> 07:56.440
I mean in the anti-clock manner, then it is destructive.

07:56.720 --> 08:01.160
So swastika, when it is moving in its right direction,

08:01.400 --> 08:04.440
clockwise in front and anti-clockwise at the back,

08:04.640 --> 08:07.440
if it is moving in the right direction,

08:07.640 --> 08:10.280
all negativity is thrown out on the periphery,

08:10.480 --> 08:13.120
and absolutely they cannot enter in.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.880
But if it is moved on the left-hand side

08:16.080 --> 08:18.160
then anybody can enter in.

08:18.440 --> 08:21.480
So it is, even if you move a swastika, see now,

08:21.680 --> 08:24.200
create a kind of a opening.

08:24.440 --> 08:27.680
If you make a swastika and see, it opens out.

08:27.880 --> 08:30.640
But if you move it this way, there’s no opening.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.360
It goes on closing, one on another.

08:33.560 --> 08:37.720
So by moving it left side, it starts

08:37.920 --> 08:42.200
opening itself to these negative forces.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.960
This is exactly what has happened in the West,

08:45.160 --> 08:49.160
that they had their Mooladhara moving on the left-hand side,

08:49.360 --> 08:51.400
the anti-clockwise. They went against

08:51.600 --> 08:54.440
their own principle of morality,

08:56.600 --> 08:58.640
absolutely against Christ,

08:58.840 --> 09:02.440
and managed to get all these bhoots into themselves.

09:02.680 --> 09:04.600
Now Sahaja Yoga has one problem,

09:04.800 --> 09:07.520
in the West,

09:07.760 --> 09:11.720
that people don’t want to hear that you should be moral.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.440
They find it very difficult.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.760
If you tell them you have to be moral they think we are

09:18.120 --> 09:20.600
fundamentalist or something like that.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.800
But it’s a fundamental thing that we have to be moral people.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.800
Now they are seeing the results of it, that they have got AIDS,

09:28.000 --> 09:30.400
they have got all these diseases, all these troubles.

09:30.600 --> 09:34.680
From that they are learning that our Mooladhara should be

09:34.880 --> 09:37.480
all right, otherwise all these problems can come.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.360
But still they don’t want to accept it,

09:40.560 --> 09:42.600
that they have done mistakes.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.400
So this is another ego problem

09:44.600 --> 09:47.320
that they think: ‘Oh they are very much glorified

09:47.520 --> 09:50.160
and they should be glorified, they did something new’.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.480
I mean if you go and cut your nose,

09:52.680 --> 09:54.520
you don’t glorify such people.

09:54.760 --> 09:59.680
But something like that has happened and this,

10:00.040 --> 10:02.920
kind of a nonsense is still stabilized,

10:03.120 --> 10:06.200
and people don’t think much against it.

10:06.400 --> 10:09.080
But the sufferings are so much,

10:09.280 --> 10:11.920
that whatever you may try the sufferings are there,

10:12.120 --> 10:14.360
and they have to accept that they have gone wrong,

10:14.560 --> 10:16.680
and they have done such a wrong thing,

10:16.960 --> 10:19.880
and that’s what they deserve.

10:20.640 --> 10:24.760
But whatever it is, despite all their

10:24.960 --> 10:26.760
- you can say the

10:28.440 --> 10:32.760
foolhardiness or tomfoolery, whatever you may call it,

10:32.960 --> 10:34.440
they are to be saved,

10:34.640 --> 10:38.720
and something has to be done for them because,

10:39.280 --> 10:43.480
after all they are all seekers and they deserve to be

10:45.080 --> 10:47.720
saved.

10:48.800 --> 10:52.320
But with ego they don’t understand their own benevolence.

10:52.560 --> 10:56.360
To them benevolence is that their ego should be satisfied.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.480
So Sahaja Yoga is not like this

10:58.680 --> 11:00.840
that you just put some spirit into somebody

11:01.040 --> 11:03.120
and the person feels absolutely

11:03.320 --> 11:05.720
elated for a time being and then is finished.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.000
But it is something that has to grow,

11:08.200 --> 11:11.800
it’s a living process, it grows within us, it takes time,

11:12.000 --> 11:14.720
and sometimes people get frustrated with it.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.200
But we should not.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.000
We should know we are the foundations

11:18.240 --> 11:20.360
and this is the most important work we are doing

11:20.560 --> 11:24.160
in the history of spirituality. So far,

11:24.360 --> 11:27.240
such work has not been done before.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.400
So, this is such a big thing that we are doing

11:30.600 --> 11:33.000
and we should be very satisfied with ourselves,

11:33.200 --> 11:34.560
and should be confident,

11:34.760 --> 11:38.360
because this requires people of quality.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.120
Not necessarily you should be well-educated,

11:41.320 --> 11:44.800
you should be highly placed.

11:45.040 --> 11:49.040
Though to impress people might be this might help, but still,

11:49.400 --> 11:55.320
if you are deep people you can work out, in no time.

11:56.040 --> 11:58.120
If the soil is not good,

11:58.320 --> 12:01.280
then the tree has to go deep down. In the same way,

12:01.480 --> 12:05.040
when the atmosphere is not good,we have to go deep down.

12:05.240 --> 12:08.280
But one should never feel frustrated.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.280
One should never feel upset,

12:10.480 --> 12:14.480
because even if you are one person you are a Saint,

12:14.680 --> 12:16.480
and a Saint brings all the luck,

12:16.680 --> 12:19.480
all the auspiciousness to that country, so

12:19.680 --> 12:23.960
there’s nothing to feel in any way desperate or unhappy about it.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.040
But try to develop your depth by meditation

12:27.240 --> 12:31.280
and by collective sitting down and talking to each other.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.080
I’m sure this will work out

12:33.280 --> 12:37.200
and this Force of Mahakali will manifest.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.760
After this puja I am sure something tremendous should happen.

12:40.960 --> 12:45.160
As it is you know that all these false gurus have been exposed

12:45.360 --> 12:48.000
and are put on the shelves now, most of them.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.320
Some of them have died, some of them exposed some - has happened.

12:51.520 --> 12:55.080
Gradually they will all disappear. We don’t have to worry about them.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.520
We have to worry about ourselves

12:56.720 --> 12:59.760
that negativity should not fall into us,

12:59.960 --> 13:03.680
and the negativity that falls into Sahaja Yogis

13:03.880 --> 13:05.400
is the frustration.

13:05.600 --> 13:09.200
They feel: ‘We are very few, others are so many,

13:09.400 --> 13:12.480
why should we so few?’ I mean it’s all right.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.320
That has to be that way, doesn’t matter.

13:15.520 --> 13:18.440
And to have more people

13:18.640 --> 13:21.920
is not so important as we should have quality people.

13:22.120 --> 13:25.960
We should have very good quality people who are deep,

13:26.160 --> 13:29.520
who understand Sahaja Yoga, who know it very well,

13:30.120 --> 13:31.760
because even if you have too many

13:31.960 --> 13:33.240
and they don’t know anything about Sahaja Yoga,

13:33.440 --> 13:37.480
they are useless. So not only that you should have this love

13:37.680 --> 13:41.440
of God’s Divine Nature

13:41.640 --> 13:44.120
but also knowledge about Sahaja Yoga.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.320
Both things are the same, actually if you love someone

13:47.520 --> 13:50.600
you know about that person everything.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.800
When such a thing

13:54.560 --> 13:57.040
will happen all over the world that,

13:57.240 --> 14:00.160
so many countries will accept Sahaja Yoga,

14:00.360 --> 14:04.840
and so many will start talking openly about it,

14:05.080 --> 14:06.840
on a very high level,

14:07.040 --> 14:09.280
then even the countries

14:09.480 --> 14:12.880
which have not been able to achieve much results,

14:13.080 --> 14:16.280
or we can say cities, will suddenly jump up.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.520
I have great hopes from Toronto.

14:18.720 --> 14:22.520
Toronto will come up very well I think and I’m sure tonight also,

14:22.720 --> 14:26.280
we’ll have lots of people who will be sticking on.

14:26.480 --> 14:30.040
Because no use having thousand people and ultimately two turn up,

14:30.240 --> 14:32.000
that sort of thing,

14:32.320 --> 14:33.880
common experience.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.720
So this would be a better idea.

14:36.920 --> 14:40.080
And today’s prayer should be, in our hearts,

14:40.280 --> 14:42.720
that let us

14:43.320 --> 14:48.640
get very powerful Ganesha Shakti, let us get that.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.200
And second should be that

14:51.400 --> 14:55.400
this Shakti should destroy all that is negativity.

14:55.600 --> 14:58.600
Even not to be collective itself is a negativity.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.520
All these collectivity problems,

15:01.720 --> 15:04.640
or all these negativity problems

15:04.840 --> 15:08.200
must be destroyed by this Mahakali Power

15:08.400 --> 15:10.840
which will manifest through us.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.040
May God bless you.
