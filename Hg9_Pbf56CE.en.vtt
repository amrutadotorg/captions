00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.780
So today is a very happy and a

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
very very auspicious day for all of us.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:33.120
That we have to offer a just a thread

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.880
to our brothers for their protection.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:45.100
I've already told you the story of Alexander the Great.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:49.040
How many of you have not heard it? Raise our hands.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.180
Look at that! Ha ha ha ha. Can't be! All right.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.120
So I'll tell you the story of Alexander.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.760
Ha ha ha. You're very clever, I know. Ha ha ha.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.300
All right.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:07.260
So the story of Alexander is like this.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:12.920
That Alexander the Great invaded India, you know,

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.140
much before Buddha was born. Or we can say...

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.080
No, we can say after Buddha was born.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:27.680
And he went with the idea of conquering the whole of India.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.800
He was very powerful man.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:37.180
But God did not want that perhaps,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.840
so he was once defeated

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.600
and one king called Puru arrested him.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:49.620
Alexander had married an Indian lady.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.040
And when he was under the arrest of this king,

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.020
that was the day of this Raksha Bandhan. Same day.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.580
So, she was a clever lady,

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.440
she put one thread like this in a small little plate

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.860
and covered it nicely with some nice cloth

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.300
and sent it to the king Puru in his court.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.480
When he took it to the court,

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.280
somebody, and gave it to him,

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.560
he had to wear it. Because that was the day of Raksha Bandhan.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:33.200
And that day anybody who sends you this thread is...

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.440
you become the brother.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.420
So then he asked, "Who is my sister?"

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.100
So they said, "She is the wife of Alexander."

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.080
And he got really upset with him, because a sister's husband

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.740
is something very great in India.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:58.480
So he rushed to the jail and fell straight on his knees

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.740
and begged off his pardon. He said, "I am sorry sir,

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.240
I didn't know you were the husband of my sister."

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.200
He said, "What?" 
[King Puru:] "Ya, you are.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:12.300
And I am sorry! I am very sorry for this thing,

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:18.560
that I have jailed you this way and I put you here behind the bars.

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:22.060
This was very wrong on my part."

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:25.180
And he was so apologetic,

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:28.180
that Alexander could not understand the whole thing.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.480
Not only that! He brought him back

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.140
and put him on the throne, his own throne.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.200
And he said, "Now you rule here, I cannot say anything.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:38.820
Now you'll become the real king

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.540
and I have to become sort of your subject."

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.640
So Alexander started looking at him.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.580
He said, "I... I can't understand this."

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.360
So then he went to his house.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.160
Then he went to his house with

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.760
so many things that the king had given him.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.700
He gave jewelry, he gave saris, clothes for him

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.200
and all kinds of things plus horses and elephants.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.660
And then, when he reached home, he found

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:19.360
that his wife was smiling behind the doors.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.160
He said, "What's the matter?"
She said, "Don't you understand?"

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.540
He said, "No, I don't understand, these Indians are funny people.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.520
I mean, I am such a dangerous man, he had put me in the jail

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.900
and now he has released me. I just can't understand these Indians.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:40.220
How can this happen to a person who is so dangerous?"

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:43.640
So, then she smiled and she said,

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.140
"See, today is a day of Raksha Bandhan

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.620
and this is the thread I sent him.

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.160
And because this thread was tied to him, he became my brother

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:55.560
and he had to release you.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.120
Because you are my brother." [Shri Mataji probably means "husband", ed.]

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.960
He was so frightened. He said, "That settles it. I am going home!

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.980
Because with this Indians who can leave a prisoner only on a thread,

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.200
you can't manage these people, are very difficult."

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.380
He could not understand.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:18.160
Somebody can translate it in Italian,

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.820
because there are some Italian people here.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.520
You can do it later on. The story can be told to them

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.200
in Italian language.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.420
So this is what it is. Is so important,

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:36.380
that on this day if this is tied on your wrist,

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:40.500
then you become brothers and sisters.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:46.120
Now, in Sahaja Yoga brotherhood is the most important.

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.700
That is the friendliness among ourselves.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.600
When you are very good brothers and sisters,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.220
first of all, your left vishuddhi improves. This left vishuddhi.

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.540
You get this left vishuddhi, because

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.220
we don't have proper brother and sister relationship.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:07.360
Is not that we should have our own sister,

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:12.560
but any woman who is a Sahaja Yogini is your sister.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.780
Except for your own wife. And this is the feeling.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.440
Unless and until we develop that pure feeling within ourselves,

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.580
we cannot work out Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.640
Sahaja Yoga cannot be worked out.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.440
I know it's rather difficult to digest, but is a fact.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:34.500
You have to feel clean and pure within your heart.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.440
Now see, we are so many Sahaja Yogis together,

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.920
live in ashrams. We have no problems.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.500
But supposing, if you had these problems,

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.380
this girl is running away with that boy,

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.040
that boy is running with that girl,

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:49.700
could not have known with whom she is living today.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.420
And those problems can only be solved,

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:59.100
if you have the proper sense of a sister and a brother.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.360
And that is our dharma. That is our valence.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.440
That we should know that we have a brother,

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.740
who is our Rakhi brother, and all others are also our brothers.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:19.640
A pure relationship must exist between brothers and sisters

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:25.360
and of course you have your own wife, which is your private thing.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.380
There should be something like private in Sahaja Yoga

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.660
and that is the only thing that is private for you,

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.200
that you are husband and wife.

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.580
The rest of it is all collective.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:40.580
And we have to live in a collective way among ourselves

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:44.340
in very pure relationships.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:51.140
Now, as it is, we have to be in a collective way.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:57.620
At a slightest provocation people become non-collective.

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.360
They cannot have rapport with other Sahaja Yogis,

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.640
they cannot talk to other Sahaja Yogis,

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.540
they cannot live with other Sahaja Yogis,

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.540
then something wrong with them.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.880
They must understand something wrong with them

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.840
and nothing wrong with others.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:14.960
I know of a Sahaja Yogi who came and told me, "Mother,

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.580
they are very unkind to me, they are very suspicious of me,

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:22.440
they do this and do that." Nothing of the kind! It was his own mind

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.500
that was working like that and giving him ideas

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.760
against other Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.900
So never criticize your brothers and sisters.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.400
There is no need to criticize.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.180
If you have to criticize, criticize yourself.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.440
Best way is to criticize yourself and see for yourself,

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.740
what's wrong with you that you cannot fit into the collective.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.640
As you know, it's a tremendous task

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.520
and so important today, so vital,

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.520
that we all should establish Sahaja Yoga properly.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.960
Without Sahaja Yoga, do you see any, any other remedy,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.640
any other solution for today's chaos? We do not see any.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:08.600
Now, what do we have to do? I don't say you must

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.140
bring Himalayas here, nor do I say

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.460
that you must swim for seven miles together,

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.500
nor do I say that you must take a plane

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.560
which will take you round the world in one night.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.560
Nothing of the kind. These feats are not needed.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:30.460
A simple feat of rapport,

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.820
of love being communicated to others.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.820
Just a simple thing it is, it's the simplest.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
You see the children; how they are so simple,

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:46.820
how they are so natural, that they immediately feel the love

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:50.400
and immediately react. But we cannot.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:54.260
The why... what is the reason? Why can't we react in that way?

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.420
Why our attention is not on that point

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.440
where we should react in such a manner

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.440
that we should be absolutely congenial,

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.060
enjoying each other's company.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:11.760
The reason is, our attention is outside.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.740
And the attention is outside in the West, as you have seen it,

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:19.940
on something wrong, because there is no brother-and-sisterly feeling.

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:23.460
Supposing, a brother and sister are walking,

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.720
they won't look at each other, will they?

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.980
Will they be watching each other? No.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:38.320
But the attention that goes outside all the time towards

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.460
all kinds of funny things, because there is no pure relationship.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:47.680
Purity helps you to understand the beauty of others.

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:51.300
Otherwise there's a thought in between, always a thought.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.420
If it's a dirty thought, of course the purity is not there at all.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:59.600
But even other thoughts like possessiveness, of criticism,

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:05.400
say, of repulsion, anything like that can kill the joy.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.520
So try to understand that there is something wrong with you,

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.480
that's why you cannot get truly collective.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:19.700
We are one homogeneous big huge family.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.660
And for any mother,

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:26.340
what is the greatest pleasure, which I have told you many times, is that

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.360
to see her children enjoying each other,

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:34.680
loving each other. And when I see all of you

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:39.000
loving each other and pulling each other's legs

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:43.140
and pinching everyone and enjoying each other's company,

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.380
I really enjoy. And when you shout at each other

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:52.040
and also sometimes box each other, I like it. (Laughter.)

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:54.680
Because there is an expression of love in it.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.500
And that is what we have to learn, how to express ourselves.

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.500
First, express yourself to your fellow being that are

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.700
your kith and kin, are Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.480
They are your brothers and they are your sisters.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:13.040
Like once Christ was told, "Your brother and sisters have come."

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:16.740
He said, "Who are My brothers and who are My sisters?"

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.100
These are His brothers and these are His sisters!

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.120
He is the eldest brother you have

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.320
and you are all His brothers and sisters.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.340
That is how one should understand

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.240
that this is a relationship of brother and sister.

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:34.120
And that's such a pure relationship.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:37.760
Now, when this relationship goes off,

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:42.260
you get into troubles. Very much into troubles.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.300
Whenever I went to Cambridge, I found the Vishnumaya

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.340
would just go on bombarding there.

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.820
Every time there used to be lightening, lightening, lightening.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.660
This time it was at least hundred and eight times,

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.900
there was bombardment when I was there.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.300
Whole night I couldn't sleep, I was wondering.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.800
But now I realized what was the reason is

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.820
that in Cambridge University,

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.820
it's a university just like Oxford, any other university,

00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:10.380
but Cambridge University is one of the most important universities.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.760
In that university there are young people,

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.160
young boys, young girls studying.

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.200
In an university the relationship between

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.420
brother and sister should be absolutely pure.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:27.260
So pure that generations together we cannot marry.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.300
As we have in our country, the gotras.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.700
What are the gotras? Are the universities.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:37.320
And people cannot marry in the same gotra for generations together.

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.740
Even now supposing my gotra is Shandilya,

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.700
which was, must be, thirteen fourteen thousands years back.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.260
And even today I cannot marry a person who is from the same gotra.

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:50.960
So imagine, such purity was maintained and that is what it is.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:54.440
In a university, there is no purity maintained.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.840
That's the reason in Cambridge, I found, that

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.880
whenever I go there, Vishnumaya goes on just...

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.700
I don't know, She could just goes mad.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.120
And every time we have had this experience.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.960
And now I know the reason,

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.560
so I am sure next time She won't do that.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.380
Is very important, specially in young age, to understand

00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:20.980
that we have to keep our attention very still.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:23.480
If you do not gather wisdom in young age,

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:26.780
you can never have wisdom in old age.

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:30.440
In young age you must try to gather wisdom. Is very important.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.720
And this wisdom comes from Shri Ganesha, as you know.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:37.100
And what is Shri Ganesha? Is innocence,

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:42.040
is purity and also is knowledge.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.740
From that it comes to you and that purity

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:49.480
has to be kept the way Shri Ganesha had kept

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:53.640
in His own incarnation as Christ.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:57.420
So we have to understand that our attention has to be

00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.960
so pure, so pure that it should not waste

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.300
anyone of our energies.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.860
You know that with purity in your eyes,

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.040
even a glance, even a glance

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.660
can create such a beautiful life for others. Even a glance.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:20.640
So, one has to try, is to get very pure eyes.

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.460
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:26.220
This is what we have to follow, all of us,

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:28.680
and our attention has to be all right.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.200
For that this Raksha Bandhan is a very good thing.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:35.220
Is a very good thing in which you create

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.300
such personality of your own that

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:43.520
you do not anymore try to put your attention on the wrong thing.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.740
Now, this attention goes out with many other things also,

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.740
like aggressiveness, can be possessiveness.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:56.220
But the main thing is this, that if you do not have

00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:00.240
lust in your eyes, fifty percent you are all right.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.040
And half or fifty percent is greed,

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:05.380
for which you have to work on the Nabhi chakra

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:08.340
and which we'll work it out on Diwali day.

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.140
So for today, I think we have to remember

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:15.640
that to get rid of all the lust from our eyes,

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:21.620
we are celebrating today this beautiful auspicious day

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.960
to celebrate the love between brothers and sisters.

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:30.520
Now, I don't know whom you have chosen to be your new sister today.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:35.900
But it should not be just a thing of a lip service.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.820
Sister is a sister and all your life

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.060
you have to remember she is your sister.

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:47.120
You have to look after her benevolence and her good life

00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:52.440
and she has to bless you or she has to pray to God

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.560
that you should be always protected.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.740
May God bless you all.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:05.300
So now, if you have anybody between yourselves...

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:08.540
Now, have you got the Rakhis?

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.720
Aah, we must... today I must say

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:15.060
that poor Warren had to go back to Shudy Camps,

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.900
because nobody is there and Shudy Camp is alone,

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.900
so somebody has to go and tie Rakhi to him.

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:23.260
But he tied a Rakhi to me, a first of all, you see,

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.240
is very clever fellow.

00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:28.460
And taken away my watch.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.020
Alright.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.580
In such a big group it's not easy to do all the

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:49.080
rituals we did last time, alright? But -, now.

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.940
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.240
Now, first of all,

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:12.740
the girls who want to tie Rakhi

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.160
should take it from here, one each,

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:18.460
and go and tie to anyone you feel like.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.680
But tie to one person.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.960
And one person should tie to one person.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:29.660
Not that only everybody tying to one person, is not good.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:35.020
All right. So here it is. Now, who it is, who will give it to you?

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.780
So these are here, you can take anyone you like. Now.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:53.280
[Shri Mataji speaking in Indian language.]

00:26:55.440 --> 00:27:00.480
So what you can do is to tie one to your...

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.760
one each, everybody should have. And should tie... exchange it.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:07.240
Is it alright?

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.600
This is to be tied to the brother only, but

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:15.600
in North India they also tie to their sister.

00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:20.180
So that's here now. [?] So the sister's is on the left hand

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.340
and the brother's is on the right hand.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:26.500
Now, how do you do it. Pass it on, to everyone.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:33.180
Now, don't run for one person.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.140
You can tie it... [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.720
From Australia.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:05.500
Somebody else should come here to distribute.

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:10.840
Antonio, just take it. Take it, from here.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.640
They are only two, we can give it to the leaders

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.360
or something, here, separately.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:27.960
I'm sorry for delay, but I was cooking for all of you well...

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.140
You should read this after.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:50.740
It's alright. So I'll take this?

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:57.280
Now, should we... we can sing some songs also, while distributing.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.060
Perhaps some music?

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:17.040
Today I am sorry, we'll not have any pujas because I am really...

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:19.520
I'll have three pujas now, one after another.

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.860
It will be too much. We had Bhoomi Puja

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.720
and now we are going to have, I mean, alright?

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.080
Krishna Puja, then Ganesha Puja, then Devi Puja,

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:31.760
so it's going to be too much. So I would request you that this is...

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:36.000
Today it's just like a puja after all, isn't it?

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:40.780
Very good. This one.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.880
Helen will take all my things.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.980
This is a... I don't think we'll need that.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.360
Come along, come along!
