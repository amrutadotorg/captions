00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:40.627
Today we have all gathered here for
worshipping your Guru.

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:50.090
As you know that the principle of Guru
resides in the Void.

00:04:53.808 --> 00:04:58.406
This is the principle which gives you
balance,

00:05:00.631 --> 00:05:06.218
which gives you the gravity.

00:05:06.424 --> 00:05:15.625
The gravity that we have in the Mother
Earth

00:05:18.474 --> 00:05:26.021
is expressed through your Guru principle.

00:05:29.542 --> 00:05:35.345
The first point of gravity is

00:05:36.365 --> 00:05:46.493
that you should have a personality,
a character and a temperament

00:05:47.249 --> 00:06:01.321
that people would see that you are
a personality

00:06:01.522 --> 00:06:08.545
who doesn’t get dissolved into worldly
things.

00:06:08.746 --> 00:06:22.925
Is a personality which doesn’t get ruined
by the skirmishes of life.

00:06:23.126 --> 00:06:34.224
Is the personality of a Guru which sits
down deep into his -

00:06:37.384 --> 00:06:53.377
into his being and is not easily disturbed
or dissolved by

00:06:59.986 --> 00:07:02.784
any solvent what-so-ever.

00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:11.974
This is the first principle of the Guru, is
the gravity.

00:07:12.175 --> 00:07:18.427
As I told you, it is something which cannot
be dissolved into anything.

00:07:18.628 --> 00:07:24.332
It settles very deep down into your
personality.

00:07:24.533 --> 00:07:28.949
So it doesn’t float in the water.

00:07:30.132 --> 00:07:37.258
Now you see, in the countries which are
developed very much

00:07:37.575 --> 00:07:50.658
we think that we have a very great power
of individual attainment.

00:07:50.859 --> 00:08:00.488
That individually we are absolutely free,
we can do whatever we like

00:08:00.822 --> 00:08:07.756
and that’s why individual freedom becomes
the goal of all democratic countries,

00:08:07.957 --> 00:08:14.612
neglecting the collective. Of course,
individual is important,

00:08:14.813 --> 00:08:19.204
and it has to become all right to nourish
the collective.

00:08:19.405 --> 00:08:25.886
But if the individual does not have
the gravity,

00:08:26.087 --> 00:08:36.238
then they float on the surface and anything
can impress them.

00:08:36.439 --> 00:08:42.443
That’s why we find today people get
impressed by fashions.

00:08:42.644 --> 00:08:53.162
By fashions, which by no logical reason are
good for your health, for your wisdom.

00:08:53.363 --> 00:08:55.659
[To somebody, "Sit down".]

00:08:56.216 --> 00:09:06.691
No fashion is good for your health, nor for
your development as a personality.

00:09:06.892 --> 00:09:12.870
Sometimes you look so odd with it,
so funny, so stupid.

00:09:13.071 --> 00:09:17.959
Then this, ask your question, “What’s
wrong in becoming stupid?

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.314
What’s wrong in becoming foolish?”

00:09:24.338 --> 00:09:30.638
The reason is, you have an individual
freedom, but your personality has not grown.

00:09:30.839 --> 00:09:34.838
You personality is zero. You have no
personality left.

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:37.498
You cannot decide anything for yourself.

00:09:37.699 --> 00:09:41.693
Whatever is the fashion you just run after
that.

00:09:41.894 --> 00:09:50.973
Is this situation of the Western countries,
but in the countries like India now

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:56.162
there are also in some sort of a craze.

00:09:56.384 --> 00:10:04.456
Because they have to still pass through
this so-called affluence that you have.

00:10:04.657 --> 00:10:07.532
So they'll take to the crazes, like
supposing

00:10:07.733 --> 00:10:10.866
somebody sees a very beautiful carpet with
someone,

00:10:11.067 --> 00:10:13.950
then all rush to buy that carpet.

00:10:14.151 --> 00:10:18.819
They’ll do anything for getting things
to themselves.

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.856
So they turn towards materialism also
in the same way

00:10:23.057 --> 00:10:27.268
as you people turn to fashions.

00:10:28.257 --> 00:10:36.462
The individuality is all right up to
a point, but then it becomes a madness.

00:10:36.663 --> 00:10:43.777
Especially in the west the personality is
so low, is so missing

00:10:43.978 --> 00:10:51.632
that any entrepreneur can develop any
craze, any name

00:10:51.833 --> 00:10:55.186
and everybody runs after that and is
impressed.

00:10:55.387 --> 00:10:59.795
Like a stupid fellow can call himself by
some name,

00:10:59.996 --> 00:11:07.197
say, he can call his… by some funny name -
now, say "Poison", as he says.

00:11:07.398 --> 00:11:11.984
Now to everyone to buy "Poison" is a very
great thing.

00:11:12.185 --> 00:11:17.999
Because it is by some stupid man who has
taken a name and so everybody must buy that.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.060
It is nothing special about it. It is
nothing special,

00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:31.625
it is nothing – remarkable. It is nothing
that will make you something great.

00:11:31.826 --> 00:11:36.437
But people will buy that particular make,
because it has a brand

00:11:36.638 --> 00:11:42.158
which everybody will accept. “Oh!
It’s from that particular brand.”

00:11:43.197 --> 00:11:46.640
And it’s such a madness about it.

00:11:46.841 --> 00:11:51.564
Then comes to the anything from hair style,
up to your foot style,

00:11:51.765 --> 00:11:56.059
to your neck style, to your nail style,
to your eyebrow style.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:12:01.181
I mean, anything, any stupid thing that you
could do to your body is available

00:12:01.382 --> 00:12:06.431
and people take to it because they have
no gravity in them.

00:12:07.747 --> 00:12:14.269
The persons who have gravity do not take
to such changes.

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:18.808
First logically, they’ll try to know if
this change is good or not.

00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:22.315
But only because it’s a change, it's
a craze,

00:12:22.516 --> 00:12:26.660
it's a fashion, they do not take to it.

00:12:28.883 --> 00:12:32.980
This is one of the signs of gravity in
a person

00:12:33.181 --> 00:12:41.049
that he doesn’t float on the ground like
straws.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:48.263
But it stays, it stays like a beautiful
pearl

00:12:48.464 --> 00:12:54.337
in the deep shores of understanding.

00:12:55.532 --> 00:13:00.481
So those who are today here to worship
the Guru,

00:13:00.682 --> 00:13:03.779
they have to worship their own Guru within
themselves

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:08.072
and have to understand that first thing
and foremost thing is

00:13:08.273 --> 00:13:12.653
that we must have gravity in temperament.

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:17.680
You do not need education for that,
university education.

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:23.374
You need not read books, you need not
do anything.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:31.164
Only thing is that you have to have your
value system corrected.

00:13:31.659 --> 00:13:36.345
When your value system is corrected, you
understand

00:13:36.546 --> 00:13:43.562
what is good for the society, what is good
for you.

00:13:43.763 --> 00:13:51.049
For example, if it’s a lotus flower, it
will never emit filth and dirt.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:57.261
The fragrance will be always there; if it
is a rose or any other fragrant thing,

00:13:57.462 --> 00:14:02.130
it will emit fragrance only.

00:14:02.752 --> 00:14:06.983
It cannot emit something that is filthy.

00:14:07.184 --> 00:14:12.044
Now those who think they are Gurus and have
achieved that gravity

00:14:12.245 --> 00:14:20.624
will never write something which is ugly,
say something which is dirty,

00:14:20.825 --> 00:14:31.847
will never use their mind to appreciate
anything that is filthy and wrong.

00:14:34.369 --> 00:14:39.527
This is the second sign of your value
system.

00:14:39.728 --> 00:14:47.581
In your value system you have to first
of all understand what is auspiciousness,

00:14:48.239 --> 00:14:52.438
what is Divine beauty,

00:14:53.716 --> 00:14:59.185
and what is morality of the Spirit.

00:14:59.518 --> 00:15:06.282
These three things are to be realized and
are to be part and parcel of your being

00:15:06.483 --> 00:15:13.397
so that when people see you, they should
say, “Here is a person we can see

00:15:13.598 --> 00:15:21.253
who has that gravity, here is the person
who has that beauty.”

00:15:21.657 --> 00:15:25.179
It acts inside, outside.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:31.506
A person who has that sobriety inside
dresses up in a sober way.

00:15:31.727 --> 00:15:38.992
He doesn’t dress up to impress others, or
just to show off or to hide something

00:15:39.193 --> 00:15:46.149
or to expose something. But just to respect
his body, he dresses up.

00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:51.079
When he talks to others, he talks wisdom.

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:56.501
He doesn’t talk frivolous things, useless
things

00:15:56.702 --> 00:16:05.319
and things which are of very baser level.

00:16:06.197 --> 00:16:19.266
In his own enterprises, I would say, he has
a kind of a decency and a decorum.

00:16:19.467 --> 00:16:25.392
Like a person tries to become an expert.

00:16:25.593 --> 00:16:34.918
A person who worships his Guru, tries to be
an expert in his work,

00:16:35.119 --> 00:16:40.531
like supposing, there is a person who is
an engineer.

00:16:40.745 --> 00:16:45.607
He doesn’t care for money, he doesn’t care
for fame,

00:16:45.808 --> 00:16:49.929
he doesn’t care for applauses
from others.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:57.175
What he cares is, does he really understand
his subject matter. It won’t be mediocrisy.

00:16:57.376 --> 00:17:04.807
Musician has to be perfectly a musician.
Artist has to be a perfect artist.

00:17:05.008 --> 00:17:11.072
He does not use the general methods
of expertise,

00:17:11.273 --> 00:17:17.408
but his Spirit, the guidance of his Spirit
he tries to improve.

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:24.919
Like there’s a poet, he tries to improve
his poetry on the level of his Spirit,

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:30.615
but not on the level of money, because
normally people would write things

00:17:30.816 --> 00:17:35.215
just to please the majority of the people,
so they can sell their books

00:17:35.416 --> 00:17:40.176
or something filthy which is not benevolent
to the society,

00:17:40.377 --> 00:17:45.997
nor to the name of the writer, they don’t
mind, they become shameless about it.

00:17:46.198 --> 00:17:53.578
So not that the Guru himself has the value
system, but through his life style,

00:17:53.779 --> 00:18:00.289
through his own preachings, through his
own behavior

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:08.682
he radiates gravity to others – he radiates
gravity to others.

00:18:11.063 --> 00:18:16.747
So it builds up our value system, value
system of a balance.

00:18:16.948 --> 00:18:21.599
But it does not mean that if somebody wants
to become an expert on one subject

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.638
then he neglects the other side.
It’s in balance,

00:18:25.839 --> 00:18:30.539
it has to be in balance, a person say,
for example, who is a musician

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:39.433
and cannot understand a painting – he is
not an artist.

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:44.408
Supposing you are an artist and still you
do not understand Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:44.609 --> 00:18:47.681
then you are not a Yogi.

00:18:48.122 --> 00:18:55.908
So if you start from the central point of
your spirit, you’ll be surprised that

00:18:56.233 --> 00:19:04.557
the knowledge that you receive or whatever
you give is absolutely integrated

00:19:04.758 --> 00:19:08.807
and radiates from one point.

00:19:09.355 --> 00:19:18.584
So, in every way you become an expert, in
any subject you become an expert.

00:19:18.785 --> 00:19:22.876
Anybody asks you a question, you know
everything.

00:19:23.077 --> 00:19:30.167
But in that you know what is worthless and
what is of worth.

00:19:30.368 --> 00:19:36.909
You try to understand what is important.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:42.268
You know, you give up whatever is worthless
and you would not like to know

00:19:42.469 --> 00:19:48.431
the names of different alcohols. You don’t
want to be expert in that.

00:19:48.632 --> 00:19:54.226
You don’t want to be an expert on knowing
all the names of all the carpet styles.

00:19:54.427 --> 00:19:59.112
You may not like to know all the varieties
of sarees.

00:19:59.313 --> 00:20:02.269
You may not like to know all the names of
all the cameras.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:08.505
You may know, but need not feel that you
do not.

00:20:09.123 --> 00:20:18.287
But whatever is important for the gravity
of a personality, you will know.

00:20:18.488 --> 00:20:26.109
So if you want to make it simple, we can
know about auspiciousness.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:33.396
What is auspicious? You’ll know about
fair play.

00:20:33.597 --> 00:20:36.526
What is a fair play towards others.

00:20:36.727 --> 00:20:42.884
You’ll know about what is justice in
the eyes of God.

00:20:43.138 --> 00:20:51.144
You’ll know about the Divine music that
elevates your Kundalini.

00:20:51.345 --> 00:20:57.882
So as a result of this gravity you get
discrimination.

00:20:58.285 --> 00:21:04.892
That you know what is your personality and
what is the water surrounding you.

00:21:05.093 --> 00:21:09.610
You know how to discriminate and this
discrimination

00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:16.662
is also actually innately comes from your
Guru principle.

00:21:16.956 --> 00:21:22.641
But once this Guru principle goes into

00:21:22.842 --> 00:21:29.710
a bizarre state or into some sort of
a turmoil or confusion,

00:21:29.924 --> 00:21:34.701
by so many other things like you have
a wrong guru, you have a false guru,

00:21:34.902 --> 00:21:42.382
you have false ideas, you follow false
doctrines, you follow false theories

00:21:42.583 --> 00:21:51.082
or you follow false books, then this goes
bizarre.

00:21:51.283 --> 00:21:59.685
As a result of that you develop Ekadesha
Rudra on top of your head.

00:21:59.886 --> 00:22:09.264
Also in case, when you have problems

00:22:09.465 --> 00:22:16.173
of not temperant and moderate life, if you
are an extremist,

00:22:16.374 --> 00:22:22.956
if you work too hard or you don’t work
at all or if you only go on

00:22:23.157 --> 00:22:28.908
projecting yourself into one side and not
paying attention

00:22:29.109 --> 00:22:32.376
to the other side of your life,

00:22:32.577 --> 00:22:37.816
with all these imbalances, physical,
mental, emotional and spiritual,

00:22:38.017 --> 00:22:42.391
you develop problems of your Guru
principle, as a result, you develop

00:22:42.592 --> 00:22:48.005
this Ekadesha Rudra, which is the beginning
of your destruction.

00:22:48.206 --> 00:22:52.785
So how important it is to look after your
Guru principle, you can see

00:22:52.986 --> 00:22:59.109
that most of the diseases are caused by
this principle, when neglected

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:03.312
and ultimately they reach its high – their
heights,

00:23:03.513 --> 00:23:08.204
when it reaches the state of Ekadesha
Rudra.

00:23:08.405 --> 00:23:12.141
Now as realized souls you have crossed
the limit,

00:23:12.342 --> 00:23:19.986
you have come out of your Sahastrara, you
have transcended all those things

00:23:20.359 --> 00:23:26.571
through your Brahma Nadi. But that does not
mean that you have developed that gravity.

00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:33.779
You have now achieved a state.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:44.062
If a flower is there and you put the flower
on the water it will float.

00:23:44.428 --> 00:23:50.830
But when it becomes the fruit and matures,
then you put it in the water,

00:23:51.031 --> 00:23:56.366
it does not float, it goes deep down, it
doesn’t get dissolved.

00:23:56.567 --> 00:24:03.174
It keeps its own identity. That is what is
to be done now

00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:11.566
that you have to become the fruits of
Sahaja Yoga, fruits of Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:11.767 --> 00:24:15.900
Blossom time is over now, you have
to become fruits

00:24:16.175 --> 00:24:23.083
and people who see you should know
that you have no imbalances at all.

00:24:23.284 --> 00:24:31.079
You are the people with special gravity.
So when you talk to people –

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:39.442
when you have any kind of Sahaja Yoga
program,

00:24:39.643 --> 00:24:43.475
you do not behave in a childish manner or
stupid manner.

00:24:43.676 --> 00:24:50.859
I’ve seen people sitting before Me raising
their Kundalini. It’s stupid.

00:24:53.074 --> 00:24:58.749
Or giving bandhan to themselves, is stupid.
So, even coming in the Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:06.483
one can have that kind of a stupid behavior
or behavior without gravity.

00:25:06.684 --> 00:25:13.436
Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, if you
have the same style as you had before,

00:25:13.637 --> 00:25:19.109
then you have to grow, mature, you have
to become still the fruit.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:29.180
And that is the sign that you become really
the Guru principle people.

00:25:30.652 --> 00:25:40.153
It is important that we have to know
the gravity of the Mother Earth.

00:25:40.354 --> 00:25:45.362
How she revolves with such a tremendous
speed

00:25:45.563 --> 00:25:49.870
holding all of us together to her heart and
then

00:25:50.071 --> 00:25:56.083
she emits her beautiful Divine love through
the various beauties

00:25:56.284 --> 00:26:01.703
that are surrounding us, now we can see
for ourselves.

00:26:01.904 --> 00:26:06.502
Specially when I see the big mountains,

00:26:06.703 --> 00:26:14.280
I feel they are like great saints sitting
and meditating here.

00:26:14.481 --> 00:26:21.906
But they are the only ones who can catch
the Guru principle emitted by the sea.

00:26:22.107 --> 00:26:30.969
As you know the sea is the Guru principle,
and they are so high

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:36.929
that they can catch the Guru principle. So
despite the fact you have that gravity,

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:46.897
you are people of very high standards. And
you are beyond any temptations,

00:26:47.098 --> 00:26:55.730
any stupid ideas or any ideas that can
pervert or spoil others.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:27:03.380
You stand above everybody else, Stalwarts,
as we had very great people on this earth,

00:27:03.581 --> 00:27:08.304
I have given you the names and we said that
there have been ten Gurus,

00:27:08.505 --> 00:27:15.195
starting from Adi Nath, we had Confucius,
we had Socrates

00:27:15.396 --> 00:27:19.279
and later on we had Abraham, Moses and also

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:25.105
up to Shirdi Sai Nath, we had about ten
great Gurus.

00:27:25.306 --> 00:27:29.608
Now we have so many here sitting down, they
are all Gurus

00:27:29.809 --> 00:27:35.271
and they have to behave like Gurus and
they have to do the job of great Gurus.

00:27:35.472 --> 00:27:41.309
And this is what today we have to see if we
can develop that gravity within ourselves

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:50.314
and understanding within ourselves. When
that peace resides within you,

00:27:50.515 --> 00:27:57.522
the joy of becoming Sahaja Yogis will be
really felt,

00:27:57.723 --> 00:28:03.538
will be really understood and will be
enjoyed by all of you.

00:28:03.739 --> 00:28:07.296
May God bless you all!

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:24.938
Here is a symbol of a dog because the Guru
always carries a dog

00:28:25.139 --> 00:28:29.256
because he is the one who knows only one
master.

00:28:29.457 --> 00:28:34.598
And this is the disciple principle of
the Guru.

00:28:34.799 --> 00:28:41.743
So the disciple principle is like a dog,
who guards the Guru,

00:28:41.944 --> 00:28:48.807
who shows complete devotion and dedication
and all the time on the watch

00:28:49.008 --> 00:28:53.547
that wrong type of people should not come
to the Guru.

00:28:53.748 --> 00:28:56.398
But on the contrary, I think sometimes in
Sahaja Yoga

00:28:56.599 --> 00:29:00.455
people always bring wrong type of people
to Me.

00:29:00.656 --> 00:29:04.235
It watches and it knows, it has such
discretion.

00:29:04.436 --> 00:29:08.979
It knows what to do and how to behave.

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:13.609
This is what is the symbol of a disciple

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:21.070
and so this symbol has to be understood
by all of you.

00:29:28.516 --> 00:29:32.687
Now for the puja today you sit in a very
surrendering mood

00:29:32.888 --> 00:29:36.041
so that this principle awakens within you.

00:29:36.242 --> 00:29:39.008
Nobody should try to raise the Kundalini
or do anything,

00:29:39.192 --> 00:29:45.228
everything will work out smoothly and
nicely and nobody should stand up.

00:29:45.429 --> 00:29:48.543
Everybody should be seated, whichever way
you like.

00:29:48.744 --> 00:29:56.740
That's important because as I said this is
the gravity, to settle down, to settle down.

00:29:56.941 --> 00:30:04.289
That's very important, as we call Gruhastha
means the one who settles in the household

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:09.977
is the Gruhastha or we call it in Indian
language as the baithak,

00:30:10.178 --> 00:30:16.802
is the sitting capacity, how much you can
sit down on things.

00:30:19.529 --> 00:30:22.718
This child, you better ask the child to go
away. Whose child is this one?

00:30:22.919 --> 00:30:26.967
Is very disturbing… one second to that
child, yes.

00:30:27.168 --> 00:30:30.918
Just speak him up, that’s all, he’s
the disturbing one … I don't know...

00:30:31.119 --> 00:30:36.568
Let him sit outside, then he will be
alright. He’s alright.

00:30:36.769 --> 00:30:39.609
Sometimes something goes wrong with
them, you see…

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:45.289
These two girls - they should pay
attention. Children should not...

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:48.445
These two girls there - they should pay
attention, that’s important,

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:53.825
because that’s how they are going to be
helped.

00:30:55.240 --> 00:31:04.367
Now for the puja, Arneau if you come here,
I’ll be happy, because… Arneau?

00:31:04.568 --> 00:31:10.394
I’ll tell you how, what to do about these
musicians.

00:31:10.595 --> 00:31:14.368
So let the musicians join that side all
of them who have to sing,

00:31:14.569 --> 00:31:21.371
for the puja mantras and everything. You
come so you can guide them.

00:31:21.572 --> 00:31:24.374
(To the pujari) Now you have to get people
from Barcelona (?).
