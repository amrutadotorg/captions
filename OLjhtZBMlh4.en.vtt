00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
March 29th, 1986, Delhi, India

01:05:48.101 --> 01:05:50.243
I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis

01:05:51.884 --> 01:05:53.951
and to all the seekers of truth.

01:06:01.876 --> 01:06:03.860
After listening to all these

01:06:04.942 --> 01:06:07.239
beautiful words of My children,

01:06:12.345 --> 01:06:14.817
Mother cannot know what to say.

01:06:15.461 --> 01:06:17.350
It is very difficult

01:06:17.551 --> 01:06:19.709
to express My feelings

01:06:22.062 --> 01:06:25.074
of complete joy! Keval Anand!

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.732
First time when I came to Delhi,

01:06:33.918 --> 01:06:36.403
I met a set of people

01:06:40.949 --> 01:06:47.025
and I felt  it might be an impossible situation in this place,

01:06:48.053 --> 01:06:51.831
where they have not even heard the word 'kundalini'.

01:06:52.689 --> 01:06:54.772
They had heard the word 'Kundali'.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.316
And they asked Me,

01:06:57.517 --> 01:07:02.457
"Is this the Kundali that we have to see before we get married?"

01:07:02.658 --> 01:07:04.456
I was really shocked!

01:07:04.657 --> 01:07:06.790
I said , "Now, this is too much,

01:07:07.698 --> 01:07:09.952
that I have to talk to them,

01:07:11.013 --> 01:07:12.546
from the very beginning

01:07:14.061 --> 01:07:15.898
the meaning of the word Kundalini."

01:07:16.827 --> 01:07:17.827
While in the west,

01:07:18.969 --> 01:07:21.585
the seeking has been

01:07:21.786 --> 01:07:24.749
so intense,

01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:33.772
that people went into deeper seeking into books

01:07:35.177 --> 01:07:38.244
and those who came to me knew about Kundalini.

01:07:39.762 --> 01:07:41.242
Also they told Me, that

01:07:42.726 --> 01:07:45.547
most of the seekers have reached the conclusion,

01:07:45.748 --> 01:07:51.020
it is the Kundalini,which will give us realisation.

01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:54.755
But today to find so many people,

01:07:56.674 --> 01:08:02.239
those who have got realisation, not only that, but they are

01:08:03.489 --> 01:08:07.313
so well equipped, so highly evolved,

01:08:08.864 --> 01:08:12.555
that I can only bow to them.

01:08:18.635 --> 01:08:21.133
When we deal with new people

01:08:21.835 --> 01:08:25.999
the Sahaja Yogis have to understand

01:08:26.394 --> 01:08:29.644
certain basic things as I understood Myself,

01:08:29.969 --> 01:08:31.469
when I first came to Delhi.

01:08:32.569 --> 01:08:35.390
Must know that they do not know a word about Kundalini.

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:40.421
It is like the people, the tree

01:08:41.369 --> 01:08:43.935
or you can say the birds which are sitting on the tree,

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:46.654
do not know anything about the bush.

01:08:48.211 --> 01:08:50.205
They may be very well read people,

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:52.681
they may be Panditas, they might be anything,

01:08:53.394 --> 01:08:55.385
but they have no idea about the kundalini.

01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:59.336
And those who have read some of the books,

01:09:00.846 --> 01:09:03.540
are absolutely frightened with the word Kundalini.

01:09:05.526 --> 01:09:06.945
So, you have to start

01:09:08.622 --> 01:09:11.310
from the very scratch in the sense, when a child

01:09:11.779 --> 01:09:13.930
has to enter into the school,

01:09:14.944 --> 01:09:20.029
he gets such a fright with the ideas that he has about the school,

01:09:20.601 --> 01:09:24.147
or with the new environment, that he just runs back.

01:09:24.828 --> 01:09:28.331
Many a times and you have to again bring him in, and bring him in.

01:09:30.427 --> 01:09:34.010
So one thing you must have realised,

01:09:36.643 --> 01:09:40.556
that the all pervading power of Chaitanya, Omkara,

01:09:40.792 --> 01:09:43.534
is nothing, but the power of love of God.

01:09:45.934 --> 01:09:47.025
In love,

01:09:48.315 --> 01:09:51.511
one thing you have is patience.

01:09:54.336 --> 01:09:57.294
Patience is the ocean

01:09:58.495 --> 01:10:01.475
that you get when you love someone.

01:10:05.117 --> 01:10:06.613
But to love

01:10:08.018 --> 01:10:10.764
also is not very easy.

01:10:12.112 --> 01:10:13.340
For human beings

01:10:14.584 --> 01:10:17.704
to love means, you get attatched to that person.

01:10:18.727 --> 01:10:20.290
You get fond of that person.

01:10:20.937 --> 01:10:23.278
You get attatched to one or two persons.

01:10:23.417 --> 01:10:25.456
You like only few persons.

01:10:27.409 --> 01:10:32.056
But, as I have told you before that as a sap in the tree rises,

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:37.567
goes to all the branches, to all the flowers, to all the fruits

01:10:37.872 --> 01:10:41.642
and comes back, nourishing all of them,

01:10:41.956 --> 01:10:46.585
the way they want to be nourished, comes back. In the same way,

01:10:47.707 --> 01:10:51.611
the Divine love has to nourish every thing

01:10:52.455 --> 01:10:53.455
to be detached....

01:10:53.593 --> 01:10:57.748
absolutely nourishing every soul

01:10:58.498 --> 01:11:00.010
and then it comes back.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:03.130
If that cannot be achieved,

01:11:05.681 --> 01:11:10.486
then we should say, it is not love that is Divine.

01:11:12.961 --> 01:11:16.962
Today, I wanted to speak to you in Hindi language,

01:11:18.409 --> 01:11:20.212
because Hindi is a much easier language

01:11:20.413 --> 01:11:22.854
to explain Sahaja Yoga or Kundalini.

01:11:24.333 --> 01:11:25.916
English is a very confused

01:11:27.273 --> 01:11:31.611
language, I think as far as the inner side of the life is concerned.

01:11:33.177 --> 01:11:35.833
For example, when we say mental,

01:11:37.071 --> 01:11:39.853
we do not know whether we say, it is Buddhi or Mannah.

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:41.587
Buddhi or Mannah

01:11:42.919 --> 01:11:44.903
We say, it is a mental projection.

01:11:45.732 --> 01:11:48.902
But a mental case is a person, who is  suffering from Mannah.

01:11:49.728 --> 01:11:51.107
is a psychological.

01:11:51.308 --> 01:11:55.650
So the psyche as well as the intelligence is mental

01:11:55.852 --> 01:11:57.459
according to English language.

01:11:57.903 --> 01:11:59.205
and when they say 'mind'

01:11:59.408 --> 01:12:00.383
is such a

01:12:01.113 --> 01:12:02.601
confused

01:12:04.069 --> 01:12:07.910
word, that I don't understand what do they mean by 'mind'.

01:12:09.638 --> 01:12:13.999
Now in Sahaja Yoga we have to clearly understand what is

01:12:14.799 --> 01:12:16.089
Buddhi is

01:12:17.033 --> 01:12:20.022
and what is the Mannah is.

01:12:21.282 --> 01:12:23.137
And you must have seen in Sahaja Yoga,

01:12:23.662 --> 01:12:24.975
here is the picture.

01:12:26.579 --> 01:12:27.779
When the Sahaja Yogis are explaining

01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:31.014
to people in English language, they have to be very careful.

01:12:31.697 --> 01:12:34.855
Is better to use Hindi language, which is very simple,

01:12:35.170 --> 01:12:36.170
clearcut

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:37.705
and gives you

01:12:38.165 --> 01:12:39.165
a full

01:12:40.417 --> 01:12:43.068
understanding as to what is what.

01:12:44.264 --> 01:12:47.212
But in English, you have to use lot of discretion to understand

01:12:47.956 --> 01:12:49.257
this word 'mind'.

01:12:50.107 --> 01:12:53.619
Now here as you know we have two sides, left and right side.

01:12:55.448 --> 01:12:58.920
Left side is the side which deals with Mannah.

01:13:02.342 --> 01:13:04.806
The right side is the one, which deals with Buddhi

01:13:07.958 --> 01:13:10.605
and the Mannah part is the one

01:13:11.955 --> 01:13:14.403
in which, when we indulge

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:20.351
it is not so rational and we cannot explain.

01:13:20.816 --> 01:13:23.558
We will say it is our desire,

01:13:24.811 --> 01:13:25.926
I don't like it.

01:13:28.434 --> 01:13:31.049
I don't like it has no connection with mind.

01:13:31.296 --> 01:13:32.963
My mind doesn't accept it.

01:13:33.167 --> 01:13:36.148
It means there is something , which we

01:13:36.432 --> 01:13:37.723
cannot make understand, with the help of Buddhi.

01:13:39.754 --> 01:13:42.045
Now if we argue with the help of Buddhi

01:13:42.339 --> 01:13:44.219
There will be only argumentation by our Buddhi.

01:13:44.469 --> 01:13:47.589
Then whatever we present, and you will take it as truth.

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:50.984
For example, if a capitalist will come

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:53.312
he will eat your brain so much,

01:13:53.513 --> 01:13:55.343
that you will be convinced, that this is the truth.

01:13:55.544 --> 01:13:57.097
That you will think that only capitalism is the truth.

01:13:57.298 --> 01:14:00.393
If any communist comes he will  just bother you.

01:14:01.659 --> 01:14:05.975
and he will prove that only communism is the truth.

01:14:06.282 --> 01:14:09.191
then, there will be some other 'ism'.

01:14:09.699 --> 01:14:11.909
Then in the same way, in the case of  religion as well,

01:14:12.647 --> 01:14:16.030
whenever a religion was established and man used his Buddhi,

01:14:16.301 --> 01:14:18.290
it (religion) was put in such a (Gharonda?).....

01:14:19.304 --> 01:14:23.010
and was imprisoned in such a manner that,

01:14:23.314 --> 01:14:26.850
that religion became a perfect prison.

01:14:28.062 --> 01:14:29.759
Now these are the (Chakkar?) of Buddhi....

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:33.990
There is no word for (Chakkar?) of Buddhi in English. What can I do?....

01:14:34.685 --> 01:14:36.269
Anyway you get a (Chakkar?) in that language.

01:14:36.944 --> 01:14:39.369
But there is no word for (Chakkar?).

01:14:39.798 --> 01:14:41.199
In that (Chakkar?),

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:43.137
creating all the (Chakkar?) out of Buddhi

01:14:43.358 --> 01:14:45.447
entangled you in that (Chakkar?).

01:14:46.466 --> 01:14:49.089
In our religion it is so, it is so in your religion,

01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:50.764
in this person's religion it is so, and

01:14:50.965 --> 01:14:52.216
in that person's religion it is so

01:14:52.517 --> 01:14:55.065
and at last, beat, kill and put an end to each other.

01:14:56.403 --> 01:14:59.661
This is not possible in any religion.

01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:03.483
So where did these frogs come out?, you should ask....

01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:06.183
If it is not possible in that religion, where did these come from?

01:15:06.384 --> 01:15:08.761
If you take water to some place and leave it to rot,

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.600
What will be the result?

01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:14.313
Where the water remains still,

01:15:14.684 --> 01:15:19.156
it stagnates, there every type of insect breeds.

01:15:20.416 --> 01:15:22.499
The same is the case with this Buddhi.

01:15:22.911 --> 01:15:27.584
When you categorise Buddhi in a paticular (Gharonda?)

01:15:27.785 --> 01:15:30.800
any thought process, called as an opinion (dharna)....

01:15:31.001 --> 01:15:37.205
you accept it as something special,

01:15:37.417 --> 01:15:40.569
then everything gets exposed and everything becomes useless

01:15:40.774 --> 01:15:43.577
and the same thing which you have accepted,

01:15:45.342 --> 01:15:47.671
your accepted (Gharonda?), becomes null and void (Sadasya?)....

01:15:48.289 --> 01:15:50.403
Then it is difficult to come out of it.

01:15:51.031 --> 01:15:54.086
If somebody tells you, you won't like it.

01:15:54.745 --> 01:15:57.312
Because this work is done like this,

01:15:57.662 --> 01:16:02.588
that when a person gives full importance to his ego

01:16:02.789 --> 01:16:05.547
and as I said,

01:16:06.174 --> 01:16:10.212
makes his palace or call it a prison,

01:16:11.185 --> 01:16:12.109
gets it completely done,

01:16:12.399 --> 01:16:17.318
when other people get impressed, enter and settle down there,

01:16:17.628 --> 01:16:20.715
then it is impossible to take them out of that,

01:16:20.916 --> 01:16:24.080
because they too develop the (Gharonda?) of ego....

01:16:24.281 --> 01:16:26.891
and in that they are satisfied....

01:16:27.463 --> 01:16:29.590
They feel they have achieved it.

01:16:30.577 --> 01:16:35.382
But a person who thinks that i have not acquired anything as yet

01:16:37.183 --> 01:16:39.120
Recently, while delivering a lecture in Poona,

01:16:39.370 --> 01:16:42.322
I said, "whatever dharmas you have done,

01:16:43.092 --> 01:16:44.544
did you achieve any thing out of that?"

01:16:44.745 --> 01:16:46.659
Everbody waved their hand to suggest 'no'

01:16:47.251 --> 01:16:50.880
And it is a fact, that till now we have not achieved anything.

01:16:51.771 --> 01:16:56.916
Then were those religions false? Now I will say "yes."

01:16:57.875 --> 01:17:00.959
But, those who gave Dharma, those who had professed it before,

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:03.649
they were not deceitful. We made them deceitful.

01:17:03.873 --> 01:17:06.580
We used our Buddhi to prove it false.

01:17:06.781 --> 01:17:09.237
We created the (Chakkar?), and got entangled in these (Chakkar?).

01:17:11.239 --> 01:17:12.275
These (Chakkar?),

01:17:12.476 --> 01:17:15.664
of every type, of every category,

01:17:15.915 --> 01:17:18.223
whatever suits him he joins that.

01:17:19.144 --> 01:17:21.078
Now to save oneslf from these problems

01:17:21.337 --> 01:17:23.470
a solution has to be found out, first of all.

01:17:24.381 --> 01:17:26.075
Because if you want

01:17:27.025 --> 01:17:30.567
to fly towards the sky,

01:17:30.822 --> 01:17:34.623
it has to be seen, that your gangway should atleast be empty.

01:17:35.164 --> 01:17:42.241
but in that only, if ox, buffalo, cow, goat and birds are grazing,

01:17:42.442 --> 01:17:44.037
how will you fly?

01:17:45.663 --> 01:17:50.785
The same way, path to our spiritual ascent is full of stange ways

01:17:50.986 --> 01:17:53.028
Which we are not ready to accept,

01:17:53.228 --> 01:17:55.388
that there is something within us.

01:17:55.874 --> 01:17:57.800
Now the same is the case with Sahaja Yogis too.

01:17:58.602 --> 01:17:59.766
No, it is not so.

01:18:00.047 --> 01:18:03.630
E.g., right now we had Shivratri Puja.

01:18:03.831 --> 01:18:07.049
Shivratri, I have said that, that day Shivji manifested

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:09.849
In the universe, he took the place of Sada Shiva.

01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:14.161
It is a great thing, you should celebrate that day.

01:18:14.411 --> 01:18:18.327
That day it is spring time,

01:18:18.984 --> 01:18:23.274
it should be celebrated with great pomp and show.

01:18:23.475 --> 01:18:25.341
On the contrary, everybody keeps fast.

01:18:27.111 --> 01:18:28.111
Puja was during the night.

01:18:28.878 --> 01:18:30.826
It went on till 12 o'clock, 1 o'clock.

01:18:30.989 --> 01:18:31.989
The puja was over at 1 a.m at night.

01:18:32.667 --> 01:18:35.972
Everybody's face looked ,as if they had beaten somebody, somewhere.

01:18:36.222 --> 01:18:37.837
I enquired, "What happened?"

01:18:38.038 --> 01:18:39.635
They said, "We were on fast since morning."

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.515
Why? why did you keep fast?

01:18:41.765 --> 01:18:45.239
When you are in Sahaja Yoga now," Why do you keep fast?"

01:18:45.440 --> 01:18:47.764
When you have been forbidden to do so, still you will keep fast.

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.140
because ,

01:18:49.343 --> 01:18:52.998
Parents and grand parents, have been fasting, so we too will do so.

01:18:55.518 --> 01:18:57.280
If your parents or grand parents have made any mistake,

01:18:57.481 --> 01:18:59.018
why should you follow it?

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:03.341
Your parents and grand parents would not dress up in pant.

01:19:03.752 --> 01:19:05.157
They would dress up in dhoti.

01:19:05.393 --> 01:19:07.316
"Do you dress up urself in dhoti ?"

01:19:09.621 --> 01:19:13.948
Today, when you know that in Sahaja Yoga fasting is totally forbidden,

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:16.736
Yes, you do fasting, do it for your body

01:19:16.937 --> 01:19:19.259
but, don't do it in the name of Shivji.

01:19:19.813 --> 01:19:22.418
To fast in the name of Shivji I cannot

01:19:22.619 --> 01:19:24.890
understand, because He would never fast.

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:26.940
When He didn't get anything,

01:19:27.288 --> 01:19:30.464
He would drink whatever the poison was there.

01:19:32.579 --> 01:19:35.504
People fast on the birthday of Shivji like this.

01:19:36.152 --> 01:19:40.235
In Sahaja Yoga too, we follow both the things.

01:19:40.436 --> 01:19:43.175
And that is, our old

01:19:44.072 --> 01:19:45.524
traps in our neck,

01:19:46.292 --> 01:19:48.057
we are influenced by that stretch.

01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:49.943
And when it pulls,

01:19:50.209 --> 01:19:52.055
we find that the horse has followed the other route

01:19:52.397 --> 01:19:53.238
and not only one.

01:19:53.464 --> 01:19:54.285
No problem

01:19:54.498 --> 01:19:58.166
Mother had said it is so, and you go that side.

01:19:59.352 --> 01:20:02.254
In reality, in this way you

01:20:03.368 --> 01:20:04.746
are direspecting Shivji.

01:20:06.079 --> 01:20:07.705
Those who are not Sahaja Yogis,

01:20:07.906 --> 01:20:09.378
will be pardoned for hundred crimes

01:20:09.656 --> 01:20:11.934
because they are not connected to God.

01:20:12.167 --> 01:20:13.965
They don't know the truth.

01:20:14.021 --> 01:20:16.338
So, they are pardoned for their hundred crimes.

01:20:16.664 --> 01:20:18.740
But those who are Sahaja Yogis,

01:20:19.028 --> 01:20:24.242
all that is totally forbidden to Sahaja Yogis, when you do that,

01:20:24.605 --> 01:20:26.303
it effects you definitely.

01:20:26.504 --> 01:20:29.568
and after that four, five people had heart trouble.

01:20:30.565 --> 01:20:31.749
Then he came to me to say,

01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:34.242
"Mother, I am in Sahaja Yoga for the past so many years,

01:20:34.443 --> 01:20:35.566
why did I get heart trouble?"

01:20:35.986 --> 01:20:38.733
I said ,"Did you keep fast on the day of Shivratri?"

01:20:39.028 --> 01:20:39.945
'Yes, did it religiously. "

01:20:40.146 --> 01:20:41.455
I said: "Then you have to suffer (Bhogiye?)."

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:45.693
Now you please Shivji by taking a lot of food!

01:20:46.690 --> 01:20:49.954
No, doctor has forbidden absolutely. Doctor has said to lie down,

01:20:50.155 --> 01:20:51.841
do this, do that. I said, "Either,

01:20:52.042 --> 01:20:53.586
listen to your doctor or to me."

01:20:54.755 --> 01:20:56.870
Sahaja Yogis must know that now they

01:20:57.071 --> 01:20:58.925
have come into the kingdom of God.

01:20:59.126 --> 01:21:01.144
When you have come to the kingdom of God,

01:21:01.345 --> 01:21:04.167
we cannot do, what is not there.

01:21:06.258 --> 01:21:09.199
The law of this country is, not that of London.

01:21:09.342 --> 01:21:13.323
In the same way the law that God's kingdom has, should be followed.

01:21:13.672 --> 01:21:16.989
You slip down sometimes, in little little issues.

01:21:18.135 --> 01:21:21.387
As I had told the day before yesterday, one shakti is Urdhvagami.

01:21:21.588 --> 01:21:24.323
and the other is Adhogami, which leads us downwards.

01:21:25.108 --> 01:21:26.461
We, like monkeys sometimes follow

01:21:26.662 --> 01:21:30.207
Urdhogami and sometimes Adhogami.

01:21:30.408 --> 01:21:32.262
So in this way,

01:21:33.515 --> 01:21:37.150
how can you ascend if you jump like this.

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:40.702
Many a times, people ask, "Mother, How can this be done?"

01:21:40.965 --> 01:21:42.861
Just hold one string !

01:21:43.062 --> 01:21:44.162
Walk in one way !

01:21:44.471 --> 01:21:45.546
Understand that !

01:21:45.785 --> 01:21:48.999
You may fast or not it makes no difference to me.

01:21:49.258 --> 01:21:52.956
It is not so, that you keep fast and I will get some money,

01:21:53.157 --> 01:21:56.478
or you may not fast and confectioner will get money.

01:21:56.739 --> 01:21:58.980
All the things mixed together is that,

01:21:59.181 --> 01:22:01.076
it is absolutely deep and subtle.

01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:03.018
It is not a frivolous thing

01:22:03.872 --> 01:22:07.796
It is a very deep thing and its connection is

01:22:08.329 --> 01:22:09.329
with your understanding.

01:22:10.944 --> 01:22:13.696
If inside you (Shunyata?) doesn't take place.

01:22:14.028 --> 01:22:16.358
then Sahahajayog will spread as such

01:22:16.559 --> 01:22:18.637
but will not raise you higher

01:22:19.111 --> 01:22:23.543
To raise it higher it is necessary to understand its depth.

01:22:26.919 --> 01:22:30.748
Today there are mostly Sahaja Yogis, new people are few.

01:22:31.217 --> 01:22:32.880
I am not telling them anything

01:22:32.983 --> 01:22:35.511
because if I tell them anything they will just run away.

01:22:35.805 --> 01:22:37.388
that SHE is telling something else,

01:22:37.508 --> 01:22:39.561
We will have to give up this, give up that

01:22:39.762 --> 01:22:41.873
Automatically it drops off.

01:22:42.074 --> 01:22:44.975
Automatically this thing drops off.

01:22:45.221 --> 01:22:46.606
If we observe otherwise

01:22:46.741 --> 01:22:47.927
there are so many people

01:22:47.975 --> 01:22:51.150
who have so many diseases they are unaware of.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:54.045
And they can't even understand that

01:22:54.246 --> 01:22:55.885
how and when did they get this disease

01:22:56.086 --> 01:22:57.633
when they go to madhouse,

01:22:57.834 --> 01:22:59.051
they come to know that they have become mad

01:22:59.054 --> 01:23:00.954
They do not know till the end that they have become mad

01:23:01.155 --> 01:23:03.659
but other people know that they have become mad

01:23:04.558 --> 01:23:07.077
The reason is that had they got their self realisation,

01:23:07.269 --> 01:23:08.876
from the beginning only

01:23:09.785 --> 01:23:12.028
left side, swadishthan and agnya's catches

01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:14.653
will indicate that he is following that path

01:23:15.511 --> 01:23:17.229
I am about to have some mental problem

01:23:17.430 --> 01:23:18.364
He will understand at once

01:23:18.565 --> 01:23:20.725
and at once he can treat it and get well.

01:23:21.099 --> 01:23:23.238
But suppose he did not take the treatment at all

01:23:23.849 --> 01:23:27.242
and would go on following the same path without paying any attention

01:23:27.885 --> 01:23:31.222
It is certain that you will reach the place where you have to reach.

01:23:32.167 --> 01:23:34.742
First of all it should be decided where we have to reach.

01:23:35.232 --> 01:23:37.724
We have to reach the Kingdom of God.

01:23:38.751 --> 01:23:42.723
To go there first of all a human being must have joy (Allhad).

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:44.902
He should feel joy

01:23:45.815 --> 01:23:47.470
There should be enthusiasm

01:23:47.843 --> 01:23:51.669
Half dead people cannot go into the Kingdom of God.

01:23:52.051 --> 01:23:53.587
Fasting people cannot go at all

01:23:53.770 --> 01:23:55.285
There is (Chaaon?) of eatries.

01:23:55.575 --> 01:23:58.522
If you want to trouble any mother, then you should fast

01:23:59.858 --> 01:24:01.814
If you have to trouble your mother,

01:24:02.002 --> 01:24:03.155
you say "o.k. i won't have my food today".

01:24:03.356 --> 01:24:05.443
It is over then for the mother, the whole day is waste.

01:24:06.278 --> 01:24:07.321
It is the same thing

01:24:07.522 --> 01:24:12.486
that I told you such a minor thing, there are so many major things

01:24:12.507 --> 01:24:14.273
in which we get entangled.

01:24:14.313 --> 01:24:18.557
then we become politicians and then get involved in something else.

01:24:18.899 --> 01:24:20.648
You are saints.

01:24:22.208 --> 01:24:23.371
You have got

01:24:24.196 --> 01:24:29.617
innumerable powers which you can awaken yourself and can use.

01:24:30.434 --> 01:24:33.375
But when we say, "Mother we surrender to you",

01:24:33.576 --> 01:24:35.408
what did you surrender to Me?

01:24:35.526 --> 01:24:39.506
I don't want anything. What are you surrendering?

01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:44.232
Just think, what are you surrendering to Me

01:24:44.725 --> 01:24:48.828
you are surrendering what you have self made rules (Bede?).

01:24:49.525 --> 01:24:52.012
all these (Gharonde) in which you are residing

01:24:52.213 --> 01:24:56.188
all these what are called, self made individual prisons

01:24:56.233 --> 01:25:00.300
in that prison you are  thinking in an organised way

01:25:00.501 --> 01:25:02.029
that you are in the Kingdom of God.

01:25:03.235 --> 01:25:07.517
This has to be surrendered and the easiest way to surrender is

01:25:07.767 --> 01:25:10.102
that you should first of all go into

01:25:10.303 --> 01:25:12.510
thoughtless awareness in meditation

01:25:13.585 --> 01:25:15.255
When you get thoughts

01:25:15.888 --> 01:25:21.628
through that thought itself your past actions

01:25:22.936 --> 01:25:26.893
we should say, your home, (Gharonde?) will encircle you.

01:25:27.094 --> 01:25:30.427
The amount of time you can be in thoughtless awareness,

01:25:30.628 --> 01:25:34.108
that's how much your tree will grow.

01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:39.087
In thoughtless awareness only  (Atmic?) tree grows.

01:25:39.441 --> 01:25:44.858
and there is no other environment where it can grow.

01:25:45.309 --> 01:25:49.577
Somebody will say, i sung a lot of Mother's bhajans, not with that

01:25:49.778 --> 01:25:50.985
A person may sing any number of bhajans,

01:25:51.186 --> 01:25:52.464
recite any number of mantras

01:25:52.528 --> 01:25:56.719
or may say anything, with that mantra or bhajan if thoughtless

01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:01.244
awareness does not establish, you have missed the goal.

01:26:01.874 --> 01:26:06.760
There are many people I saw, 'Hare Rama', 'Hore Rama', 'Hore Rama'

01:26:06.961 --> 01:26:08.740
just like mad people the whole world is running.

01:26:08.941 --> 01:26:10.527
Where are you going ?

01:26:11.488 --> 01:26:14.529
Entertaining and running all, saying 'Hore Rama, Hore Rama'.

01:26:14.730 --> 01:26:15.579
What will you get out of that?

01:26:16.183 --> 01:26:17.369
Did anyone get anything out of that?

01:26:17.435 --> 01:26:20.480
Was there any change in anybody? Did they acquire any good quality?

01:26:20.719 --> 01:26:24.569
Only instead of wearing these type of clothes

01:26:24.770 --> 01:26:25.745
you wear something else.

01:26:25.975 --> 01:26:27.968
And on the roads you are running and shouting

01:26:28.169 --> 01:26:29.746
'Hare Rama Hare Krishna'

01:26:30.006 --> 01:26:33.097
Did you get any consciousness of Krishna ?

01:26:33.685 --> 01:26:36.269
Krishna's consciousness is to be in the witness state.

01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:37.674
Are you in witness state ?

01:26:38.432 --> 01:26:42.174
Then in such external affairs involvement also

01:26:42.396 --> 01:26:44.202
a human being sometimes

01:26:44.451 --> 01:26:48.923
from his Urdhavami Gati can turn to his Adhogami Gati.

01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:52.456
For example, I told you about a small subject, ENTERTAINMENT.

01:26:53.276 --> 01:26:54.264
Entertainment

01:26:55.231 --> 01:26:57.470
is not forbidden in Sahaja Yoga

01:26:57.762 --> 01:26:59.804
but the entertainment should be such that

01:27:00.005 --> 01:27:01.755
it establishes thoughtless awareness.

01:27:02.418 --> 01:27:03.955
Lecture should be such that

01:27:04.156 --> 01:27:06.255
it establishes thoughtful awareness in you.

01:27:06.271 --> 01:27:07.636
Mantras should be recited in a way,

01:27:07.837 --> 01:27:09.655
so that thoughtless awareness establishes within you.

01:27:10.101 --> 01:27:11.556
Dhyan should be such that it should

01:27:11.757 --> 01:27:13.495
establish thoughtless awareness within you.

01:27:14.010 --> 01:27:17.212
While doing any work, if you become Nirvichar

01:27:17.273 --> 01:27:20.490
all the powers of God will activate within you.

01:27:21.230 --> 01:27:24.639
So the first thing is that you should get thoughtless awareness

01:27:24.853 --> 01:27:28.523
But people like such things which make them thoughtful.

01:27:28.984 --> 01:27:30.321
in which man goes on thinking,

01:27:30.522 --> 01:27:32.148
like mad people thinking and thinking

01:27:32.179 --> 01:27:34.373
He feels Ah! Ah! how much did i think!

01:27:34.623 --> 01:27:37.088
or while reading, suddenly think like this

01:27:37.175 --> 01:27:39.246
yes, i am a great scholar !

01:27:39.792 --> 01:27:43.229
These scholars don't have any place in  the Kingdom of God.

01:27:43.907 --> 01:27:45.570
There is a place for those people,

01:27:45.745 --> 01:27:51.830
who allowed their spirit to enlighten their attention thoroughly.

01:27:52.146 --> 01:27:55.209
And its medium is only one, Nirvicharita.

01:27:55.862 --> 01:27:59.391
So first of all, you should establish Nirvichar Samadhi.

01:28:00.397 --> 01:28:03.383
After getting thoughtless awareness you see that

01:28:03.584 --> 01:28:06.463
by and by, there will be a change in your attitude on its own.

01:28:07.111 --> 01:28:10.139
In thoughtless awareness, you start looking at yourself

01:28:10.361 --> 01:28:13.527
Apart from others, you start finding faults with yourself.

01:28:14.013 --> 01:28:16.810
First of all when Sahaja Yogis come from outside

01:28:16.952 --> 01:28:20.432
or first of all when, we should say (Satya Shodhak?) come

01:28:20.472 --> 01:28:23.920
they go on finding, oh ! is he a Sahaja Yogi ? He was like this

01:28:24.121 --> 01:28:25.958
is he a Sahaja Yogi ? he was like that.

01:28:26.046 --> 01:28:27.815
On seeing them, they take an about turn.

01:28:29.516 --> 01:28:31.120
Sahaja Yoga is open for everybody.

01:28:31.321 --> 01:28:33.119
For everybody, the door is open.

01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:37.357
Some people who are in its womb are great !

01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:40.401
And those who are in its periphery

01:28:40.602 --> 01:28:42.710
Those who move about, those who move on the periphery,

01:28:42.742 --> 01:28:45.869
they can have many defects and they too can become alright

01:28:46.246 --> 01:28:47.680
You took a turn upon seeing them,

01:28:47.881 --> 01:28:49.334
and where did you land?

01:28:51.369 --> 01:28:54.024
When you will come inside you will see

01:28:54.437 --> 01:28:57.520
those who are sitting in womb, is there any quality in them?

01:28:57.775 --> 01:29:00.422
is there any miracle in them? They have acquired something.

01:29:00.708 --> 01:29:02.559
then while seeing them we should think

01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:04.363
that we too have to achieve something

01:29:04.466 --> 01:29:06.724
and there should be a transformation in us too.

01:29:06.954 --> 01:29:08.960
When you are in thoughtless awareness,

01:29:09.161 --> 01:29:10.914
you look at yourself in witness state

01:29:11.194 --> 01:29:15.266
and at once you understand that now a days i am playing tricks

01:29:15.767 --> 01:29:18.445
it is O.K. you are getting very tricky

01:29:18.819 --> 01:29:20.857
you look at yourself in a mirror

01:29:21.046 --> 01:29:23.486
You great tricky fellow! What do you want to say!

01:29:23.915 --> 01:29:28.062
In no time your trick collapses down on earth and comes to an end.

01:29:28.939 --> 01:29:30.475
The reason is that whatever is useless

01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:33.803
whatever overburdens us

01:29:34.018 --> 01:29:36.495
whatever is an obstacle to our ascent

01:29:36.665 --> 01:29:38.577
that sheds off by and by.

01:29:39.256 --> 01:29:43.823
In thoughtless awareness only, you can watch everything

01:29:43.863 --> 01:29:45.518
which should be called by a feeling of indifference

01:29:46.780 --> 01:29:50.141
in which you can't have any attatchment to anything.

01:29:50.610 --> 01:29:53.415
For example your son is there, you watch him with indifference.

01:29:53.682 --> 01:29:55.902
you should watch him in a witness state.

01:29:56.393 --> 01:30:00.008
Just see this innocent child ! How beautiful is he !

01:30:00.239 --> 01:30:04.544
How nice he is and how much loving he is to God !

01:30:04.867 --> 01:30:07.558
Then you will watch his talking, walking

01:30:07.759 --> 01:30:10.461
and in every thing his joy,

01:30:10.662 --> 01:30:13.882
which God with His own beautiful hands has endowed him

01:30:14.083 --> 01:30:16.610
in his each step, in his minutest act

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:18.857
in his walking, in his talking, in his laughing

01:30:18.888 --> 01:30:22.360
you will see how much he is

01:30:23.392 --> 01:30:27.062
absolutely some form made by God only.

01:30:27.371 --> 01:30:29.565
But it should not be that he is my child

01:30:29.637 --> 01:30:30.395
Again you have done so

01:30:30.469 --> 01:30:31.878
give him two slaps

01:30:31.986 --> 01:30:33.751
again you have gone, you have done that

01:30:34.001 --> 01:30:36.342
all that joy is to be enjoyed is finished.

01:30:37.029 --> 01:30:39.847
By being in the witness state, child also can understand you.

01:30:40.276 --> 01:30:41.558
and the child will think

01:30:41.772 --> 01:30:45.696
see they are watching me and i too am watching them.

01:30:46.488 --> 01:30:51.700
and by and by, the power of thoughtless awareness,

01:30:51.901 --> 01:30:53.595
he too can get Atma Sakhshatkar

01:30:54.524 --> 01:30:56.099
what is called 'neutral',

01:30:56.300 --> 01:30:58.724
after being neutral in thoughtless awareness,

01:30:58.925 --> 01:31:00.539
you watch others.

01:31:01.025 --> 01:31:02.788
When you come to Sahaja Yoga

01:31:02.989 --> 01:31:04.718
first of all you must be neutral

01:31:04.919 --> 01:31:07.675
For example, when a scientist goes to a college

01:31:07.876 --> 01:31:11.393
in the beginning he goes neutral, to see what is there further ?

01:31:11.782 --> 01:31:13.988
But if from the beginning only, you are wise

01:31:14.028 --> 01:31:16.393
then to you Sahaja Yoga says, 'Forgive, (please) go!'

01:31:16.594 --> 01:31:17.594
'Go with your wisdom'.

01:31:19.051 --> 01:31:22.626
Now what these people said, you should be above Buddhi

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:26.797
It is o.k. to say to be above Buddhi but how ?

01:31:28.891 --> 01:31:31.118
The effect of Buddhi comes on one's own Agnya chakra.

01:31:31.530 --> 01:31:34.281
And to remove the effect on the Agnya chakra also,

01:31:34.482 --> 01:31:35.850
the treatment is thoughtless awareness.

01:31:37.932 --> 01:31:42.055
Buddha had only said that you know only your spirit.

01:31:42.256 --> 01:31:42.887
leave the rest,

01:31:43.149 --> 01:31:45.174
don't talk about God, don't talk about anything.

01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:46.541
Talk about (Nirishwarwad?).

01:31:46.742 --> 01:31:47.837
He said leave it.

01:31:48.088 --> 01:31:51.018
Only to talk about how to seek God,

01:31:51.219 --> 01:31:54.889
it is better to seek your own spirit (Atmanubhav?).

01:31:55.137 --> 01:31:56.137
And don't talk about anything else.

01:31:57.006 --> 01:31:58.427
The reason was to talk more in detail

01:31:58.709 --> 01:32:02.544
such people ask me also, 'Mother when shall we become God ?'

01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:04.300
O.K. You will be !

01:32:04.501 --> 01:32:05.501
Shall we be?  Yes you will be !

01:32:05.767 --> 01:32:06.767
When?

01:32:06.968 --> 01:32:09.924
They didn't give me any date in written, when you shall be so !

01:32:10.321 --> 01:32:13.975
You be only the spirit

01:32:14.176 --> 01:32:15.176
you can come to the first step

01:32:15.377 --> 01:32:17.190
We have to be only the spirit.

01:32:17.230 --> 01:32:19.143
Mother said,' Only be the spirit '.

01:32:20.536 --> 01:32:23.849
First be the spirit, then we will talk further.

01:32:23.897 --> 01:32:28.020
But as you are highly educated, you think all the more

01:32:28.221 --> 01:32:33.476
that we all in one go can be great Shankaracharya, is not possible.

01:32:33.726 --> 01:32:36.368
To be Adi Shankaracharya

01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:38.670
just on coming to Sahaja Yoga, you will not attain all the qualities.

01:32:38.887 --> 01:32:42.637
but first step is to know the spirit (Atmanubhav?), you get that.

01:32:43.755 --> 01:32:45.926
For knowing the spirit is again the same thing,

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:48.245
you have to go into thoughtless awareness.

01:32:48.495 --> 01:32:50.808
This Delhi city of yours is such that I came and since then,

01:32:51.009 --> 01:32:53.586
MY right swadishthan chakra was working so much,

01:32:53.814 --> 01:32:55.167
that I could not even sit.

01:32:55.382 --> 01:32:58.278
It means that people here think too much, and don't work at all.

01:32:59.526 --> 01:33:00.638
At least, if they will do something,

01:33:00.839 --> 01:33:04.776
the heat of thinking, will get released in doing something.

01:33:04.977 --> 01:33:06.374
But they don't do anything, they think too much,

01:33:06.575 --> 01:33:07.989
planning this, that.

01:33:08.243 --> 01:33:10.310
Now there is so much planning and see the condition of the country.

01:33:10.511 --> 01:33:12.721
Can't understand, in which country we are residing.

01:33:12.922 --> 01:33:14.841
The same, where there is so much planning.

01:33:14.859 --> 01:33:17.371
The reason is that, when you think also,

01:33:17.803 --> 01:33:19.910
till you do not work on it,

01:33:20.111 --> 01:33:23.028
what is the use of thinking, except this, that your head gets upset.

01:33:24.663 --> 01:33:28.532
And this right swadishthana catches here so much that,

01:33:28.733 --> 01:33:30.308
from the beginning only, since I am coming to Dehi,

01:33:30.557 --> 01:33:33.149
I find right swadishthana catches here, too much.

01:33:34.113 --> 01:33:35.606
It's reason is, there is newspaper here,

01:33:36.361 --> 01:33:38.662
here people are always talking about politics.

01:33:39.176 --> 01:33:42.387
here, there were some on a political post and are not anymore,

01:33:42.633 --> 01:33:43.733
they speak all the more.

01:33:44.408 --> 01:33:46.539
They got something else, then from here there are others,

01:33:46.740 --> 01:33:48.172
like this something or the other keeps going on here.

01:33:48.443 --> 01:33:52.240
Some are sitting on throne, some down the throne.

01:33:52.298 --> 01:33:54.498
Some are coming up the throne, some have come down from the throne,

01:33:54.699 --> 01:33:56.557
and are creating friendship, here and there.

01:33:56.636 --> 01:34:00.122
One is cross with the other, he has mixed with the third one.

01:34:00.372 --> 01:34:02.368
They are doing all this nonsense.

01:34:03.027 --> 01:34:05.542
It is utter nonsense, wasting time !

01:34:05.937 --> 01:34:07.683
Nobody is going to remember anyone.

01:34:08.604 --> 01:34:11.501
This didn't give them any joy.

01:34:12.277 --> 01:34:13.277
They didn't get anything special.

01:34:14.517 --> 01:34:18.336
But one who is used to run horses, doesn't give up it.

01:34:18.755 --> 01:34:20.327
Then it is a (Gharonda?) of one type.

01:34:21.613 --> 01:34:25.926
For that too, it should be thought, if it is all useless,

01:34:26.505 --> 01:34:29.846
If some time has to be wasted, then stand on one corner

01:34:30.047 --> 01:34:33.363
why is he wasting his time like mad people ?

01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:36.681
If you have understood this, then think that now,

01:34:36.813 --> 01:34:40.158
your witness state is starting, slowly and slowly.

01:34:41.202 --> 01:34:44.267
In witness state a human being does not get entangled in any problem

01:34:44.468 --> 01:34:46.862
If there is any problem, he simply witnesses it.

01:34:48.762 --> 01:34:49.762
He only witnesses.

01:34:50.033 --> 01:34:53.327
Of course, in the beginning, one feels that he is standing there.

01:34:53.577 --> 01:34:55.676
For example, I was making Dr. Sahib to understand,

01:34:56.367 --> 01:34:59.382
If while passing by a crowd, you reach a hill

01:34:59.911 --> 01:35:02.423
and you look at the crowd from that hill,

01:35:02.667 --> 01:35:05.052
if there is a forceful brake or something, you feel

01:35:05.092 --> 01:35:07.382
that you, only you, move a little sideways.

01:35:08.205 --> 01:35:10.713
But when you will come to know that you are sitting on the hill,

01:35:11.597 --> 01:35:14.454
I have simply to see, then you won't move.

01:35:14.882 --> 01:35:17.947
To get this, this is called Nirvikalpa state.

01:35:18.355 --> 01:35:22.054
In this state, a human being, sees, knows,

01:35:23.818 --> 01:35:27.739
even then he doesn't get disturbed, he goes on watching peacefully.

01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:30.013
We will say, what is there in such peace?

01:35:30.214 --> 01:35:32.086
If such people become quiet,

01:35:32.286 --> 01:35:34.128
if nobody fights, nobody says anything,

01:35:34.329 --> 01:35:35.694
then how will there be any revolt?

01:35:35.749 --> 01:35:41.803
Such a person's peace is mightier than an atom bomb.

01:35:42.397 --> 01:35:43.458
and it does majestic work.

01:35:44.184 --> 01:35:48.763
What importance shall I say about its work, that

01:35:50.677 --> 01:35:55.499
if one such peaceful person, goes to any such place where

01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:59.844
there is chaos, in no time, situation will change absolutely.

01:36:00.328 --> 01:36:02.865
But that person must be in that state,

01:36:03.066 --> 01:36:10.591
where he can spread the impact of peace all around himself.

01:36:10.919 --> 01:36:14.403
Everybody can be spell bound and become peaceful.

01:36:15.404 --> 01:36:21.770
All the chaos, can settle down systematically.

01:36:22.816 --> 01:36:23.965
As if he,

01:36:24.693 --> 01:36:25.601
has some,

01:36:26.466 --> 01:36:34.311
special magical skill, or has swirled some magical stick,

01:36:34.671 --> 01:36:36.828
that everybody becomes quite peaceful.

01:36:37.837 --> 01:36:42.348
To get this shakti is for those, who are Sahaja Yogis.

01:36:42.794 --> 01:36:45.266
Nowadays we see that everywhere 'peace foundations' are being built

01:36:45.467 --> 01:36:48.314
this is of peace, that is of peace.

01:36:49.071 --> 01:36:50.605
How can it bring peace?

01:36:50.979 --> 01:36:55.102
Peace is within us. Now if a human being says himself that

01:36:55.303 --> 01:36:57.989
he has found peace, but how can the other person get peace ?

01:36:58.857 --> 01:37:02.387
The other person gets peace, by being impressed by your peace.

01:37:02.929 --> 01:37:04.744
That effect is not on account of Buddhi.

01:37:04.965 --> 01:37:11.835
That effect enlightens the inner being and enlightens others also.

01:37:12.036 --> 01:37:14.870
and in this way, a human being becomes peaceful.

01:37:15.301 --> 01:37:18.930
Now you know, that in Sahaja Yoga , every type of people come,

01:37:19.122 --> 01:37:24.774
some very violent, some very hot tempered, some very short tempered

01:37:24.839 --> 01:37:27.358
some revolutionary,

01:37:27.559 --> 01:37:29.898
and too much argumentative,

01:37:30.187 --> 01:37:31.534
I have seen every type of people.

01:37:32.305 --> 01:37:36.630
But after coming to Sahaja Yoga, by and by, they become peaceful.

01:37:36.831 --> 01:37:40.393
But it doesn't mean that they become cowardly.

01:37:40.594 --> 01:37:43.886
It doesn't mean, they run away out of cowardice. No !

01:37:44.322 --> 01:37:47.167
They stand on the basis of their confidence

01:37:47.368 --> 01:37:49.727
and others become peaceful, by watching them.

01:37:49.928 --> 01:37:52.505
There is a chinese story, a very good story.

01:37:52.706 --> 01:37:53.825
Chinese stories are very good.

01:37:54.025 --> 01:37:59.432
One such story is that, earlier there would be cock fight.

01:37:59.964 --> 01:38:04.304
A king thought, that there is a great saint,

01:38:04.505 --> 01:38:08.774
the people who visit him become very strong and capable.

01:38:09.076 --> 01:38:14.860
So he took both the cocks and gave him to be trained.

01:38:15.061 --> 01:38:17.664
and when there will be fight, i will take them.

01:38:18.179 --> 01:38:19.918
So the cocks went to him.

01:38:20.713 --> 01:38:21.814
One month later the King came and

01:38:22.015 --> 01:38:22.948
said, "Ok, give the cocks to me."

01:38:23.292 --> 01:38:25.575
The cocks were standing gracefully.

01:38:25.776 --> 01:38:29.923
The king picked them up and took them and left them in that area

01:38:30.124 --> 01:38:31.378
where there was going to be a fight.

01:38:31.579 --> 01:38:32.679
All the cocks entered into that area

01:38:33.739 --> 01:38:35.228
Now, all the cocks were fighting among themselves,

01:38:35.429 --> 01:38:37.146
but these two were just standing.

01:38:38.718 --> 01:38:43.279
During the fighting everyone was surprised that these don't fight.

01:38:44.576 --> 01:38:48.056
And when they would think of making them to fight,

01:38:48.257 --> 01:38:49.958
they would just go on watching.

01:38:50.628 --> 01:38:52.172
All the cocks left, after being defeated.

01:38:54.732 --> 01:38:56.911
The intent of the story is that,

01:38:57.111 --> 01:39:01.292
when a person is in the ocean of peace,

01:39:02.841 --> 01:39:06.019
is present fully, like a lotus flower,

01:39:06.823 --> 01:39:10.819
on account of its fragrance, people become aromatic and peaceful.

01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:13.419
They get complete peace.

01:39:13.866 --> 01:39:16.823
What can be more powerful than this Shakti of peace ?

01:39:17.612 --> 01:39:20.076
The Shakti of forgiveness too is great.

01:39:20.263 --> 01:39:22.016
You should also learn to forgive.

01:39:22.676 --> 01:39:25.074
I see that, in Sahaja Yoga people forgive very little.

01:39:25.303 --> 01:39:26.403
Learn to forgive,

01:39:26.707 --> 01:39:30.623
Without forgiving, you cannot get realisation on your own.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.437
For example, if somebody has hurt you,

01:39:34.638 --> 01:39:36.328
and you didn't forgive him, then what did you do?

01:39:36.529 --> 01:39:38.085
You didn't do anything.

01:39:39.611 --> 01:39:42.153
If you didn't forgive, means, you didn't do anything.

01:39:43.169 --> 01:39:46.062
Even if you forgive, strictly speaking means you didn't do anything.

01:39:46.451 --> 01:39:47.764
But if you say, i forgive,

01:39:47.965 --> 01:39:52.484
then by not forgiving, you were playing in other's hands

01:39:52.745 --> 01:39:55.155
he loses all his Shakti.

01:39:56.098 --> 01:39:57.721
The destructive power gets destroyed.

01:39:58.165 --> 01:40:00.210
But those who are forgiving,

01:40:01.027 --> 01:40:04.924
their Shakti is so powerful, that wherever they stand,

01:40:05.163 --> 01:40:07.960
because of their forgiveness, people can become pious.

01:40:08.412 --> 01:40:10.894
Their vices of numerous births, can be washed out.

01:40:11.185 --> 01:40:12.774
From all previous birth's

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:16.369
whatsoever problems, they have accumulated, can be over,

01:40:16.569 --> 01:40:18.297
because, he they have forgiven.

01:40:18.298 --> 01:40:21.424
Redemption from all sins is obtained only by kshma Shakti.

01:40:21.685 --> 01:40:26.451
Many a times, we say to God, "You are ocean of forgiveness !"

01:40:26.652 --> 01:40:29.370
We also say, that you are the remover of sins.

01:40:29.410 --> 01:40:32.143
We also say, "Destroy our papaas."

01:40:32.344 --> 01:40:34.303
How can He do? Only by forgiveness !

01:40:34.504 --> 01:40:36.434
By his uttering only one word 'forgive',

01:40:36.735 --> 01:40:40.411
by his one sight, by the sight of forgiveness only,

01:40:40.612 --> 01:40:42.231
all the sins are destroyed.

01:40:42.432 --> 01:40:44.992
But because we have not seen such people,

01:40:45.193 --> 01:40:48.706
We don't even think about such people,

01:40:48.907 --> 01:40:51.843
We can't even believe, that such people can be in the world.

01:40:53.898 --> 01:40:56.394
We have to find such people today.

01:40:57.637 --> 01:41:01.393
And you know, what you were, are not today.

01:41:01.684 --> 01:41:03.723
and what you are today, you won't be like that tomorrow.

01:41:03.952 --> 01:41:06.361
Tommorow, such people will be in Sahaja Yoga,

01:41:06.562 --> 01:41:09.313
who have kindness, forgiveness and peacefulness.

01:41:09.994 --> 01:41:12.180
All these Shakhtis, are ignited.

01:41:12.381 --> 01:41:15.262
On account of those, We will get all type of

01:41:15.463 --> 01:41:17.411
comfort, pleasure and peace in the whole universe.

01:41:17.959 --> 01:41:20.694
Those who have said,"I will do this, i will do that,

01:41:20.895 --> 01:41:23.502
will bring all the comfort to the world,"

01:41:23.812 --> 01:41:28.304
and many have said, that the world should be filled with happiness.

01:41:28.388 --> 01:41:33.186
Marx has said, and you have come to know that many saints have said,

01:41:33.641 --> 01:41:37.137
that whole world should be joyful. How can it be?

01:41:37.621 --> 01:41:38.522
There is only one way.

01:41:38.863 --> 01:41:43.470
When a human being, in his ascent, will find his Kundalini awakened

01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:49.701
then his mental, spiritual and physical, material assets

01:41:50.548 --> 01:41:53.009
not only this much, but in all respects

01:41:53.671 --> 01:41:57.885
his Shakti will be so transformable,

01:41:57.938 --> 01:42:00.712
that he will be able to transform every thing.

01:42:01.195 --> 01:42:02.514
If there is any problem he will transform it

01:42:02.715 --> 01:42:03.865
if there is a wave he will transform it

01:42:03.929 --> 01:42:05.604
if there is a mountain he can climb it.

01:42:06.633 --> 01:42:10.397
This great Shakti can come inside your being through Kundalini,

01:42:10.598 --> 01:42:12.419
because you have achieved your Spirit.

01:42:13.094 --> 01:42:15.511
So to receive this Shakti,

01:42:15.712 --> 01:42:18.576
the small small laws of Sahaja Yoga should be followed.

01:42:19.145 --> 01:42:20.771
First of all, forgive your self,

01:42:20.987 --> 01:42:23.562
first of all, love yourself,

01:42:24.182 --> 01:42:26.211
First of all know your self esteem.

01:42:26.472 --> 01:42:29.301
One who knows his self esteem,

01:42:29.502 --> 01:42:32.112
will not talk untruth or talk frivolously.

01:42:32.847 --> 01:42:34.855
He will not talk about downfall.

01:42:35.056 --> 01:42:37.211
He doesn't drink and fall down on the road.

01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:39.917
He doesn't talk deceitfully.

01:42:40.982 --> 01:42:43.490
He has his self esteem.

01:42:43.710 --> 01:42:46.238
You should have such self esteem.

01:42:46.992 --> 01:42:50.516
In that, there is no importance to caste system.

01:42:50.717 --> 01:42:54.819
There is no importance to woman or man,

01:42:55.021 --> 01:42:56.684
no importance to any country.

01:42:56.885 --> 01:43:00.632
It is a human being's own choice that he can get it.

01:43:00.833 --> 01:43:03.604
Only after acquiring that quality, a human being can know

01:43:03.805 --> 01:43:05.823
with which special form God has created him...

01:43:07.016 --> 01:43:10.518
You know, I am quite old now

01:43:10.522 --> 01:43:13.399
and I have to work very hard too.

01:43:14.256 --> 01:43:15.356
Also I have to travel a lot.

01:43:16.205 --> 01:43:19.098
Sometimes, people ask, "Mother, How do you work so much? "

01:43:19.812 --> 01:43:23.396
I think, I don't do anything, I only love.

01:43:23.808 --> 01:43:26.092
and the Shakti of love is such that it doesn't

01:43:26.293 --> 01:43:27.890
allow a human being to feel anything.

01:43:28.225 --> 01:43:30.827
Now, I feel joyous to see so many people here.

01:43:31.237 --> 01:43:32.676
From here, I will go to Calcutta.

01:43:32.877 --> 01:43:34.894
After going to Calcutta, I will rejoice to see,

01:43:35.199 --> 01:43:39.259
so much love, from all over the world, I get so much love.

01:43:39.346 --> 01:43:40.802
To get that love,

01:43:41.501 --> 01:43:44.951
however much trouble I may have to take, I can't see it.

01:43:45.110 --> 01:43:49.101
Which sadness, which troubles, which anxiety I have? Nothing.

01:43:49.768 --> 01:43:53.269
This is the greatest gift, Sahaja Yoga has given to me !

01:43:53.388 --> 01:43:58.153
You also get it and be glad in it's joy. This is my blessing to you!

01:44:29.993 --> 01:44:32.933
Those, who have come for the first time, specially for those,

01:44:36.562 --> 01:44:37.582
All of you.

01:44:38.145 --> 01:44:39.998
Are they spread all over, or sitting together?

01:44:40.655 --> 01:44:42.957
Those who have come new today, raise your hands up.

01:44:46.392 --> 01:44:49.888
If you can kindly come in the first row, it will be very good,

01:45:03.407 --> 01:45:05.292
do it from this side

01:45:12.864 --> 01:45:14.003
Rest of the people go to the back.

01:45:14.989 --> 01:45:16.610
It means that today very few Sahaja Yogis

01:45:16.811 --> 01:45:18.234
have come to celebrate My birthday.

01:45:21.175 --> 01:45:22.275
Move a little to the back and sit.

01:45:24.819 --> 01:45:27.228
Those who are realised may sit at the back.

01:45:27.372 --> 01:45:29.503
Move to the back. Let them sit in the front.

01:45:30.563 --> 01:45:31.651
Come and take your seats.

01:45:34.338 --> 01:45:35.863
Pull a chair also. Those who want to

01:45:36.064 --> 01:45:37.545
sit on a chair can sit on a chair.

01:45:38.501 --> 01:45:39.889
Mostly new people have come

01:45:41.425 --> 01:45:42.179
(Wah Bhai Wah?)

01:45:44.085 --> 01:45:45.600
Your Sahaja Yogis have not come

01:46:09.091 --> 01:46:10.962
It is very hot due to right swadisthana,

01:46:11.163 --> 01:46:12.486
right swadisthana is too much

01:46:47.843 --> 01:46:49.502
You have come for the first time today

01:46:50.478 --> 01:46:53.732
and it is good that

01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:57.646
you want to get self realisation.

01:46:59.432 --> 01:47:00.758
But

01:47:01.971 --> 01:47:02.971
one thing

01:47:04.603 --> 01:47:06.214
I request you

01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:11.894
It is very easy for you to get your self realisation.

01:47:12.641 --> 01:47:14.021
because you are Indians.

01:47:15.969 --> 01:47:19.520
Very easily you will get but

01:47:20.672 --> 01:47:22.160
it is sad that

01:47:26.850 --> 01:47:28.346
after getting it,

01:47:30.045 --> 01:47:33.394
it is just like a new seed

01:47:34.021 --> 01:47:37.518
it has to be taken care of and to go further.

01:47:38.614 --> 01:47:40.475
But I see that people,

01:47:42.658 --> 01:47:43.951
after getting self realisation,

01:47:45.293 --> 01:47:46.932
don't go deep into it.

01:47:49.321 --> 01:47:56.055
The seed that sprouts and doesn't grow will get ruined

01:47:57.095 --> 01:48:00.551
That is why every time, I say

01:48:01.266 --> 01:48:07.738
that we don't have any modern, aircoditioned ashram.

01:48:08.381 --> 01:48:10.377
Because we don't charge any money

01:48:11.123 --> 01:48:14.615
and one ordinary, we have got one place

01:48:15.024 --> 01:48:16.651
some kindhearted person has donated it.

01:48:17.159 --> 01:48:19.920
There we have set up our own center.

01:48:20.929 --> 01:48:23.083
When you will be greater in number,

01:48:23.393 --> 01:48:26.766
and when we will set up a place properly,

01:48:26.967 --> 01:48:29.938
may be, we too will have a nice hall.

01:48:30.922 --> 01:48:33.160
But right now we have a center,

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:36.102
wherever we got it, we have set up it.

01:48:36.727 --> 01:48:39.669
Actually, you know that in Sahaja Yoga,

01:48:39.871 --> 01:48:42.653
self realisation is most important.

01:48:43.089 --> 01:48:46.339
where, how, when is not important.

01:48:48.315 --> 01:48:53.121
So, all of you are requested to come there.

01:48:53.322 --> 01:48:55.033
After getting your self realisation,

01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:58.072
try for your ascent.

01:48:58.755 --> 01:49:00.781
Understand Sahaja Yoga perfectly

01:49:01.170 --> 01:49:03.494
and in this, completely

01:49:05.209 --> 01:49:06.209
attain your Gurutva.

01:49:06.808 --> 01:49:08.887
You should have complete mastery over it.

01:49:09.546 --> 01:49:10.546
Then it is something.

01:49:10.891 --> 01:49:12.529
Otherwise, you came, listened to my lecture, and got your

01:49:12.730 --> 01:49:14.621
realisation, then went and heard some other lecture some where else

01:49:18.707 --> 01:49:20.048
for such people,

01:49:21.596 --> 01:49:23.310
it won't be useful.

01:49:23.747 --> 01:49:26.155
For example, if a well is to be dug,

01:49:26.393 --> 01:49:29.803
wherever you get a little water, there only, you should dig it deep.

01:49:30.004 --> 01:49:31.803
Now, if you dig the well at ten places,

01:49:32.004 --> 01:49:33.353
then there will be only holes.

01:49:35.709 --> 01:49:36.709
So, from you,

01:49:39.491 --> 01:49:44.235
I hope, that those who have come here now, on My birthday

01:49:44.842 --> 01:49:47.855
I surely hope, that you

01:49:48.378 --> 01:49:50.657
will get Sahaja Yoga.

01:49:51.513 --> 01:49:55.665
Not only self realisation and awakening of Kundalini

01:49:55.881 --> 01:49:59.963
and its piercing of Bramharandran, something beyond that.

01:50:01.075 --> 01:50:05.753
In Sahaja Yoga, you yourself, have mastery overy it

01:50:06.833 --> 01:50:10.520
because of that you can give it to others also.

01:50:10.734 --> 01:50:14.234
For this you don't have to give up your household, or any thing.

01:50:14.472 --> 01:50:16.841
Whatever is to be given up sheds off on its own.

01:50:18.016 --> 01:50:20.976
We don't have any rules as such in Sahaja Yoga,

01:50:21.177 --> 01:50:23.151
which you cannot follow.

01:50:23.361 --> 01:50:26.411
Neither rupee, nor paise nor any thing else is required

01:50:26.792 --> 01:50:27.701
But one thing is there,

01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:33.558
respect towards yourself, and respect towards your self realisation

01:50:35.618 --> 01:50:36.519
is necessary.

01:50:37.297 --> 01:50:40.781
If it is not so, it is no use to give you realisation.

01:50:44.999 --> 01:50:48.265
If you have any question, please ask.

01:51:23.159 --> 01:51:27.534
You will have to come to our center, you come

01:51:27.941 --> 01:51:30.723
and as they tell you, you should do and your problem will be over.

01:51:32.498 --> 01:51:36.125
You too should pay attention

01:51:44.915 --> 01:51:48.099
It is ok. Don't worry at all. Come to the center surely,

01:51:48.300 --> 01:51:50.935
and do as they guide you. You will be alright.

01:51:51.268 --> 01:51:52.733
Ok?

01:52:05.756 --> 01:52:08.831
You have put a good question, that is what we are going to do.

01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:11.639
That we will do, We will do that only.

01:52:11.711 --> 01:52:15.503
See, if we tell you how a seed grows,

01:52:16.489 --> 01:52:20.569
it grows because of the power of Mother Earth, it is so.

01:52:22.649 --> 01:52:26.248
That we will do, just now we will do, say

01:52:38.976 --> 01:52:39.948
Shri Mataji: What is he saying?

01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:45.490
Sahaja Yogi: (inaudible)

01:52:45.691 --> 01:52:49.224
Sahaja Yogi: (inaudible)

01:52:49.425 --> 01:52:51.290
Sahaja Yogi: (inaudible), light will be visible.

01:52:51.552 --> 01:52:52.476
Shri Mataji: What happened?

01:52:52.677 --> 01:52:54.295
Sahaja Yogini: He is saying that

01:52:54.496 --> 01:52:56.008
in your English book it is written that

01:52:56.209 --> 01:52:58.121
Sahaja Yogini: when you will meditate,

01:52:58.322 --> 01:52:59.980
cool breeze will flow on your hands

01:53:00.181 --> 01:53:01.885
and from your head also cool breeze will flow

01:53:02.086 --> 01:53:03.339
and you will see a light.

01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:05.227
Shri Mataji: Not light, not light, it is wrong to say that

01:53:05.428 --> 01:53:07.375
If they have written it, they have written it wrong.

01:53:07.576 --> 01:53:09.496
Now what to say, i didn't read the book.

01:53:09.655 --> 01:53:11.310
Light is not going to be seen.

01:53:12.152 --> 01:53:14.461
It is wrong. Sit down. Light should not be seen.

01:53:14.485 --> 01:53:16.546
It is reverse. Light should not be seen.

01:53:16.747 --> 01:53:19.574
Suppose we see the light, that means we are not the light.

01:53:19.824 --> 01:53:21.124
We have to be the light.

01:53:21.402 --> 01:53:23.060
How can light see light?

01:53:23.251 --> 01:53:24.628
Sahaja Yogi: He is mistaking 'enlightened' for 'light'

01:53:25.112 --> 01:53:26.278
Shri Mataji: Yes, the word can be 'enlightened'.

01:53:26.479 --> 01:53:27.684
Is it in English or Hindi?

01:53:27.692 --> 01:53:28.959
Seeker: In English.

01:53:31.648 --> 01:53:32.648
(inaudible)

01:53:32.734 --> 01:53:33.734
(inaudible)

01:53:33.935 --> 01:53:39.005
It is written in the book that....(inaudible)

01:53:39.206 --> 01:53:43.261
(inaudible)

01:53:43.385 --> 01:53:45.616
Shri Mataji: It is wrong, if it is written. Not at all.

01:53:46.736 --> 01:53:49.811
Can't write like this. I have read it. You have misunderstood it.

01:53:50.264 --> 01:53:51.867
This is English language. Don't read in English.

01:53:52.068 --> 01:53:53.384
Read in Hindi language.

01:53:53.591 --> 01:53:56.595
In English language......that thing is there.

01:53:56.817 --> 01:53:59.420
Now 'Atma Sakhshatkar' is called 'Enlightenment'.

01:53:59.898 --> 01:54:02.421
Now tell me, doesn't it contain the word 'light'.

01:54:03.012 --> 01:54:04.012
Isn't it confusing?

01:54:04.373 --> 01:54:06.333
God save from English language.

01:54:06.534 --> 01:54:13.790
Seeker: Before coming to Sahaja Yoga, i used to worship Shivji.

01:54:13.813 --> 01:54:18.301
(inaudible), I read mantras also. Is this wrong or right?

01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:19.377
Shri Mataji: What is he saying?

01:54:19.578 --> 01:54:21.112
Sahaja Yogini: He is saying that before coming to Sahajayoga

01:54:21.313 --> 01:54:22.408
he used to worship Shiva

01:54:22.441 --> 01:54:24.262
After coming to Sahaja Yoga,

01:54:24.463 --> 01:54:26.285
the same mantras come to his mind again and again.

01:54:26.507 --> 01:54:28.615
And he does 'Paath' also

01:54:28.816 --> 01:54:30.785
but the same mantras come to him again and again.

01:54:30.793 --> 01:54:32.680
Shri Mataji: No, they should not come.

01:54:32.998 --> 01:54:35.635
There should not be any conditioning of anything.

01:54:35.699 --> 01:54:37.149
It should not be such that

01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:38.522
you are getting reminded of the mantras of Shivji.

01:54:38.759 --> 01:54:40.886
You ask Shivji for forgiveness.

01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:44.692
Ask Shivji for forgiveness. He is very forgiving.

01:54:44.914 --> 01:54:47.286
Actually, what you have crammed in the beginning,

01:54:47.487 --> 01:54:49.858
that is sitting inside you. It should go.

01:54:50.165 --> 01:54:52.931
Ask Him to forgive you. Every thing will be done.

01:54:54.868 --> 01:54:56.497
When we worship Shivji

01:54:57.681 --> 01:55:02.774
without getting self realisation, we didn't get connected to Shivji.

01:55:03.163 --> 01:55:05.316
and we go on saying "Shivji, Shivji, Shivji".

01:55:05.517 --> 01:55:07.553
Shivji is not our servant.

01:55:07.941 --> 01:55:10.111
that when we want, take it out of pocket

01:55:10.747 --> 01:55:13.480
Do our this work, do that work, give

01:55:13.681 --> 01:55:16.340
a job for our son, do this, do that.

01:55:16.692 --> 01:55:18.735
After all, He is God !

01:55:20.466 --> 01:55:24.313
First let there be a meeting with God,

01:55:24.545 --> 01:55:28.620
First you have to take His permission.

01:55:30.255 --> 01:55:31.727
He is God !

01:55:33.267 --> 01:55:36.164
Then remembering Him even once is sufficient.

01:55:37.013 --> 01:55:38.342
First of all meet Him.

01:55:39.692 --> 01:55:40.863
Same way, the name of Rama.

01:55:40.919 --> 01:55:42.759
Walk on the street and say "Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram"

01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:46.240
By doing so, a spirit with the name "Ram" may enter inside.

01:55:49.751 --> 01:55:51.596
Ram should be awakened within oneself.

01:55:51.644 --> 01:55:55.837
When Ram's shakti will come inside you and you will be surprised.

01:55:57.616 --> 01:56:00.938
God has allotted fixed places for all the Gods inside our being

01:56:01.139 --> 01:56:04.518
in an organised manner. We only have to awaken them.

01:56:05.645 --> 01:56:11.322
Even before that, while saying (Bhaktis?), we become mad.

01:56:11.540 --> 01:56:14.400
Bhakti can never mean any madness.

01:56:17.408 --> 01:56:19.666
Krishna has said, Bhakti is Annanya.

01:56:19.841 --> 01:56:22.099
Annanya means, when you get realisation,

01:56:22.290 --> 01:56:24.940
When you are not connected, whose bhakti are you doing?

01:56:25.848 --> 01:56:28.776
When your telephone is not set up, whom are you calling?

01:56:36.515 --> 01:56:38.705
Actually, renowned saints

01:56:39.221 --> 01:56:43.790
didn't know that we had not yet got our self realisation.

01:56:45.075 --> 01:56:47.356
They said you do bhakti.

01:56:49.293 --> 01:56:51.031
Here we have a madness about bhakti....

01:57:15.030 --> 01:57:21.241
Question: Two years back I had a spinal injury due to an accident

01:57:21.442 --> 01:57:22.460
(inaudible)...can I become alright?

01:57:22.661 --> 01:57:26.198
Shri Mataji: Yes ,you can. Will have to try. Will try.

01:57:26.341 --> 01:57:29.908
Ok? May be it will be alright by trying.

01:57:30.559 --> 01:57:32.582
Some people have become alright, some are getting alright,

01:57:32.783 --> 01:57:34.485
I will try.

01:57:34.777 --> 01:57:36.221
We must try.

01:57:39.126 --> 01:57:43.273
First, you get your realisation, at least you will enjoy your life

01:57:45.555 --> 01:57:46.301
Ok?

01:57:48.072 --> 01:57:49.072
(inaudible)...didn't come?

01:57:51.885 --> 01:57:53.488
Is there any other question?

01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:09.992
(inaudible)...is small

01:58:10.287 --> 01:58:17.013
Question: Like Shri Mataji said a few minutes back...(inaudible)

01:58:17.252 --> 01:58:22.287
(inaudible)

01:58:22.359 --> 01:58:27.811
(inaudible)

01:58:28.041 --> 01:58:30.308
There is Surya (Sun) and Chandrama (Moon), like this

01:58:30.509 --> 01:58:32.744
there are so many. Have we to give them up

01:58:32.807 --> 01:58:35.471
to come here? Or if we have gone to

01:58:35.672 --> 01:58:38.927
some other ashram, have we not to come here?

01:58:39.547 --> 01:58:43.094
Shri Mataji: (Laughs) I have understood the question.

01:58:43.953 --> 01:58:46.098
He is saying that he goes to others

01:58:46.180 --> 01:58:48.324
Sahaja Yogi: (inaudible)

01:58:48.525 --> 01:58:50.360
(inaudible)...one has to give it up?

01:58:50.448 --> 01:58:51.277
Shri Mataji: Ok. See.

01:58:51.293 --> 01:58:52.737
Sahaja Yogini: If he goes there, let him not come here.

01:58:52.754 --> 01:58:54.572
Shri Mataji: =No,No,No,No,No, No, It is not so.

01:58:54.773 --> 01:58:56.440
Now you try to understand,

01:58:56.473 --> 01:59:00.313
Where there is truth, it is good to go. I will also go with you.

01:59:02.069 --> 01:59:05.620
In an ashram where there is truth, it is alright to go there.

01:59:05.962 --> 01:59:08.625
But where there is no truth, your heart will not like to go there.

01:59:09.292 --> 01:59:12.125
After coming to Sahaja Yoga, you will yourself not like to be there.

01:59:13.553 --> 01:59:15.597
But you should go where there is truth.

01:59:16.137 --> 01:59:19.247
May be this truth will

01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:22.224
be at a peer's (Madaar?)

01:59:26.227 --> 01:59:29.389
To find this out also, you have to first

01:59:29.977 --> 01:59:33.290
find the truth, where you will be able to know with your vibrations

01:59:33.491 --> 01:59:36.506
which place is good and which is not good.

01:59:37.070 --> 01:59:39.136
Now, you will say, "Shall we go to Hanuman Mandir?"

01:59:39.439 --> 01:59:42.875
Yes, surely go, but don't apply tika on your forehead there.

01:59:43.930 --> 01:59:46.073
He will rotate your chakra.

01:59:46.323 --> 01:59:47.323
He has no right.

01:59:47.768 --> 01:59:51.033
Go to the temple surely, but don't apply their tika. Ok.

01:59:51.851 --> 01:59:54.541
These minute things you will understand yourself.

01:59:55.262 --> 01:59:56.262
Have you understood?

01:59:56.885 --> 02:00:00.504
You will yourself understand, what suits you and what does not.

02:00:00.592 --> 02:00:02.711
We will not tell you, you will yourself run from there.

02:00:04.060 --> 02:00:07.159
Say

02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:11.648
Question: (inaudible)

02:00:11.926 --> 02:00:15.418
(inaudible)

02:00:15.579 --> 02:00:21.306
(inaudible)

02:00:21.586 --> 02:00:22.328
Shri Mataji: What happens?

02:00:22.439 --> 02:00:23.034
Sahaja Yogi: (inaudible)

02:00:23.138 --> 02:00:25.920
Sahajayogini: He is saying he feels good while meditating upon you

02:00:26.121 --> 02:00:29.236
but people try to divert him from there.

02:00:29.437 --> 02:00:31.431
When people try to spoil your name,

02:00:31.632 --> 02:00:33.425
my heart feels very bad. What should I do?

02:00:33.465 --> 02:00:36.032
Shri Mataji: Where do they try to remove you from? From Ashram?

02:00:36.152 --> 02:00:39.183
From where do they remove you?

02:00:39.263 --> 02:00:46.021
Seeker: (inaudible)

02:00:46.585 --> 02:00:47.141
Shri Mataji: What is he saying?

02:00:47.173 --> 02:00:49.745
Sahaja Yogini: When he meditates upon you, they

02:00:49.946 --> 02:00:51.982
say that meditation upon you is to bother others.

02:00:52.006 --> 02:00:57.000
Sahaja Yogi: There are some people who speak against you.

02:00:57.201 --> 02:00:58.634
Shri Mataji: Let them do it.

02:00:58.674 --> 02:01:02.372
Sahaja Yogini: Please grant us wisdom

02:01:02.425 --> 02:01:03.425
Seeker: (inaudible)

02:01:03.723 --> 02:01:05.702
Shri Mataji: My dear son, they will say like that only.

02:01:05.903 --> 02:01:07.661
If they don't say, then what?

02:01:07.918 --> 02:01:08.918
That should be there.

02:01:09.069 --> 02:01:12.963
If there is no darkness, light will have no meaning.

02:01:13.164 --> 02:01:14.354
Don't feel bad about it.

02:01:14.555 --> 02:01:18.968
Seeker: I don't feel bad about it. But when I hear it

02:01:19.169 --> 02:01:23.300
outside...I really don't feel bad about it otherwise.

02:01:23.501 --> 02:01:25.281
Shri Mataji: Ok, you pray for them, that

02:01:25.482 --> 02:01:27.148
"Mother, let them all come into Sahaja Yoga".

02:01:27.349 --> 02:01:28.554
"Let them also enjoy with me".

02:01:28.846 --> 02:01:31.044
Seeker: Please grant them wisdom that they

02:01:31.245 --> 02:01:33.498
should not think like this (against Shri Mataji)

02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:38.683
Shri Mataji: Ok, very good. May you be happy.

02:01:38.884 --> 02:01:39.884
Shri Mataji: What is it?

02:01:45.795 --> 02:01:46.584
(inaudible)

02:01:46.784 --> 02:01:48.784
Sahajayogini: Does Atmasakhshatkar cause any pain to the body?

02:01:49.064 --> 02:01:50.853
Shri Mataji: No, No, No, No, No, No.

02:01:51.054 --> 02:01:52.054
SHri Mataji: How will you have pain, my dear son?

02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:55.855
Not at all ! Joy should be felt !

02:01:58.069 --> 02:02:02.227
Question: (inaudible)

02:02:03.522 --> 02:02:04.397
Shri Mataji: What is it?

02:02:04.598 --> 02:02:05.766
Sahajayogini: He is saying that when he meditates,

02:02:05.967 --> 02:02:09.296
from bottom to top (inaudible) all (inaudible) tighten

02:02:09.447 --> 02:02:10.447
It gives pain.

02:02:10.460 --> 02:02:12.324
Shri Mataji: Are you doing ? Are you doing Sahaja Yoga?

02:02:12.525 --> 02:02:14.202
Seeker: You were saying that in Sahaja Yoga

02:02:14.403 --> 02:02:15.480
one has to be in witness state.

02:02:15.536 --> 02:02:17.471
Shri Mataji: Have you done Sahaja Yoga?

02:02:17.672 --> 02:02:19.391
Did you meditate by Sahaja Yoga method ?

02:02:19.592 --> 02:02:20.968
Seeker: I do not know the meaning of Sahaja Yoga,

02:02:21.169 --> 02:02:22.753
but i have meditated in witness state.

02:02:22.954 --> 02:02:23.955
Shri Mataji: No! No! That is different.

02:02:24.156 --> 02:02:25.326
We have nothing to do with that.

02:02:25.454 --> 02:02:26.287
Sahaja Yogi: You get your realisation first.

02:02:26.319 --> 02:02:27.680
Shri Mataji: It is Ok, I am telling you,

02:02:27.881 --> 02:02:30.038
if you have done it because of someone

02:02:30.239 --> 02:02:31.808
we are not responsible for that.

02:02:31.863 --> 02:02:34.451
Try to understand that if you go to a wrong medical shop,

02:02:34.652 --> 02:02:36.369
what can we do for that?

02:02:36.570 --> 02:02:38.586
Seeker: You are telling to be in thoughless awareness

02:02:38.787 --> 02:02:42.140
(inaudible)

02:02:42.393 --> 02:02:44.329
Shri Mataji: First, what you should have

02:02:44.530 --> 02:02:46.271
is that, your cords (Tantu?) must become loose.

02:02:48.597 --> 02:02:50.849
Cords (Tantu?) of your body must

02:02:51.050 --> 02:02:53.301
become absolutely loose, first thing.

02:02:54.006 --> 02:02:55.006
Now say,

02:02:55.125 --> 02:02:56.423
Seeker: (inaudible)

02:02:56.624 --> 02:02:58.788
Shri Mataji: Nothing, Why did you get pain?

02:02:58.989 --> 02:03:00.931
Seeker: Slowly slowly when it moves

02:03:01.132 --> 02:03:02.926
from bottom to the top it gives pain.

02:03:02.958 --> 02:03:04.859
Shri Mataji: How will it happen? Why will it happen?

02:03:04.875 --> 02:03:07.168
It has all been arranged. How is it?

02:03:07.369 --> 02:03:09.533
Sahaja Yogi: He is not practising Sahaja Yoga.

02:03:09.538 --> 02:03:12.055
Shri Mataji: Ok, son, see.  You did not practise Sahaja Yoga,

02:03:12.103 --> 02:03:13.553
You have come from some wrong lane,

02:03:13.754 --> 02:03:15.243
now why are you coming on Sahaja Yoga?

02:03:15.277 --> 02:03:16.327
Shri Mataji: First you try it (sahajayoga) out, son.

02:03:16.528 --> 02:03:17.352
It is not a matter of discussion. First try it out.

02:03:17.553 --> 02:03:18.361
First do it.

02:03:18.377 --> 02:03:21.424
If you get it, it is ok, If not then you won't get it.

02:03:21.425 --> 02:03:22.946
But you do it first, nothing happens in this.

02:03:23.147 --> 02:03:25.211
Where it happens, we have no concern with that.

02:03:25.412 --> 02:03:26.317
Seeker: If you said just now,

02:03:26.518 --> 02:03:29.358
in Sahaja Yoga (inaudible) Nirvichar?

02:03:29.365 --> 02:03:31.038
Shri Mataji: Yes, but till your Kundalini

02:03:31.239 --> 02:03:32.750
doesn't awaken, till then you can't get it.

02:03:32.951 --> 02:03:35.115
I was talking to Sahaja Yogis,

02:03:35.187 --> 02:03:35.818
not to you.

02:03:36.019 --> 02:03:38.587
The people who are new, will not understand this point.

02:03:38.651 --> 02:03:40.183
Seeker: Mataji i am also new.

02:03:40.239 --> 02:03:42.119
Shri Mataji: Yes, for that only you sit down and get realisation.

02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:44.279
First get your realisation and then we will talk.

02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:47.020
According to Me, right now, you are just nothing,

02:03:47.292 --> 02:03:48.042
neither it is witness state,

02:03:48.243 --> 02:03:50.119
nor something else. Sit down, sit comfortably, son!

02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:52.113
Son, sit comfortably, it is a matter of getting it.

02:03:52.661 --> 02:03:53.661
Say!

02:03:53.862 --> 02:03:58.953
Seeker: If i say, it is 7 o'clock, (inaudible)

02:03:59.033 --> 02:04:04.863
seeker: (inaudible) I have a request.

02:04:04.895 --> 02:04:05.883
Shri Mataji: What is he saying?

02:04:05.923 --> 02:04:12.729
Seeker: (inaudible)

02:04:12.799 --> 02:04:19.541
I want (inaudible) your feet.

02:04:19.765 --> 02:04:24.081
(inaudible) Amritsar

02:04:24.176 --> 02:04:26.117
Shri Mataji: Ok, sit down, so this is the matter.

02:04:27.894 --> 02:04:30.517
Please sit down! (inaudible)

02:04:30.549 --> 02:04:34.809
Yes, son, sit, sit, sit, have a chair if you want or sit down.

02:04:35.149 --> 02:04:36.824
Is there anyone else?

02:04:38.190 --> 02:04:39.619
Please ask

02:04:39.830 --> 02:04:46.886
Seeker: I had come (inaudible), did not get sakshatkar (inaudible)

02:04:47.013 --> 02:04:48.029
Shri Mataji: It will happen, it will happen, please sit down,

02:04:48.230 --> 02:04:49.209
don't worry it will happen.

02:04:49.410 --> 02:04:51.412
We have to keep patience with ourselves.

02:04:51.618 --> 02:04:52.618
Work should be done with patience. Ok?

02:04:53.485 --> 02:05:02.976
Seeker: In Sahaja Yoga (inaudible) faith in one's religion (inaudible)

02:05:03.045 --> 02:05:05.477
Shri Mataji: You see, if yours is Guru Nanak,

02:05:05.678 --> 02:05:07.095
then you should definitely have faith in Him.

02:05:07.170 --> 02:05:09.444
Those who are real gurus, we should have faith in them

02:05:09.645 --> 02:05:11.933
and not in false gurus. Clearcut solution.

02:05:12.016 --> 02:05:13.750
I am not telling for Nanak Sahab.

02:05:13.821 --> 02:05:17.972
Seeker: (inaudible)

02:05:18.039 --> 02:05:20.739
Shri Mataji: He (Guru Nanak) is a guru, he is an Adi Guru

02:05:21.041 --> 02:05:22.430
What to say sbout Him?

02:05:22.631 --> 02:05:25.443
Seeker: (inaudible)....some contradiction...

02:05:25.697 --> 02:05:26.393
Shri Mataji: What is he saying?

02:05:26.594 --> 02:05:27.872
Sahaja Yogini: Is there any contradiction in that?

02:05:27.880 --> 02:05:30.539
Shri Mataji: How can that be, Sahab? He and I are same, understand.

02:05:30.543 --> 02:05:31.543
There is no difference.

02:05:31.845 --> 02:05:33.749
How can there be any contradiction between Him and Me ?

02:05:34.698 --> 02:05:37.845
there is none at all, but if you tell somebody, that he is our guru,

02:05:38.046 --> 02:05:40.145
and is not atmasakhshatkari, and he

02:05:40.346 --> 02:05:42.495
says that, he believes in Nanak Sahib,

02:05:42.510 --> 02:05:43.510
I am not going to recognise them.

02:05:45.813 --> 02:05:47.236
Seeker: My vibrations

02:05:47.268 --> 02:05:48.037
Shri Mataji: Are you getting it ?

02:05:48.238 --> 02:05:50.518
Seeker: Sometimes i don't get vibrations, that is why i was saying.

02:05:50.604 --> 02:05:51.287
Shri Mataji: Are you not getting it?

02:05:51.296 --> 02:05:53.216
seeker: Sometimes i don't get.

02:05:53.256 --> 02:05:56.792
Shri Mataji: Then you ask, "Mother are you Nanak Sahab? " Just ask.

02:05:56.840 --> 02:05:58.490
Ask ! Yes.

02:05:59.188 --> 02:06:00.815
How can there be any contradiction?

02:06:05.279 --> 02:06:08.164
Did you get (vibrations) ?

02:06:08.934 --> 02:06:10.975
How can there be His and Mine contradiction?

02:06:17.749 --> 02:06:23.301
(inaudible)

02:06:23.412 --> 02:06:25.339
Shri Mataji: Slowly slowly it happens sometimes

02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:27.314
that you lose your vibrations.

02:06:27.369 --> 02:06:30.143
You should find its cause. Somewhere in your heart

02:06:31.537 --> 02:06:33.011
there is a 'but' that should be brought

02:06:33.212 --> 02:06:35.541
out in the front, you should express it. That clears the problem.

02:06:35.742 --> 02:06:39.840
Sometimes vibrations can stop because of some 'but'. It is not so.

02:06:40.041 --> 02:06:40.743
You should tell.

02:06:40.944 --> 02:06:43.120
In Sahaja Yoga, nobody takes it otherwise of anything.

02:06:48.211 --> 02:06:49.211
Let us now,

02:06:53.721 --> 02:06:54.721
now,

02:06:55.776 --> 02:06:59.597
For this, since I am here for a day only,

02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:05.078
I will also tell you, how to go on awakening your Kundalini, because

02:07:05.493 --> 02:07:09.556
even if Kundalini awakens, and even if it has pierced Bramharandra,

02:07:10.977 --> 02:07:15.934
even then if there are some flaws in some chakras, some shortcomings

02:07:16.135 --> 02:07:20.529
Kundalini goes back there. So, how to awaken it again and again,

02:07:20.730 --> 02:07:26.886
along with the method for that, we will talk to you about awakening.

02:07:27.641 --> 02:07:30.069
So this hand..because of the shortage of time,

02:07:30.270 --> 02:07:34.228
I can't tell you much. I was not even expecting so many new people.

02:07:34.282 --> 02:07:36.850
Meanwhile, you should understand that the left hand

02:07:37.051 --> 02:07:39.618
is your power of desire.

02:07:39.902 --> 02:07:40.922
Keep it towards me.

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:46.366
You also do it, son, just see, try it, left hand towards me.

02:07:50.292 --> 02:07:52.089
This is your power of desire.

02:07:52.717 --> 02:07:56.335
What is your desire? That you should get your self realisation.

02:07:57.070 --> 02:08:00.371
And this hand (right hand) is our power of action.

02:08:00.760 --> 02:08:05.492
With this we will not act, but we will point towards our chakras.

02:08:06.473 --> 02:08:07.703
So, first on heart.

02:08:08.592 --> 02:08:11.219
After that in the upper portion of stomach,

02:08:11.420 --> 02:08:13.296
then in the lower portion of the stomach.

02:08:13.335 --> 02:08:16.918
All this work has to be on our left side, on our left side.

02:08:17.471 --> 02:08:22.078
Then you, then again on the upper stomach,

02:08:22.928 --> 02:08:24.929
after that on heart.

02:08:25.631 --> 02:08:28.337
Here specially, which is Vishudhi chakra,

02:08:28.631 --> 02:08:30.484
you have to put hand here,

02:08:30.685 --> 02:08:31.738
many people keep it from here (from back?)

02:08:31.786 --> 02:08:35.214
Keep it here from front, keep it like this and neck like this.

02:08:35.655 --> 02:08:39.052
After that, this hand like this.

02:08:39.892 --> 02:08:42.789
Hold it  like this, hand will be like this only.

02:08:43.766 --> 02:08:44.766
After that it will be pressed.

02:08:45.568 --> 02:08:47.436
Then the hand will be shifted to back

02:08:47.818 --> 02:08:50.778
and like this, neck will be thrown back.

02:08:50.969 --> 02:08:54.308
After that this hand, palm of the hand

02:08:54.507 --> 02:09:00.571
Stretch it fully, in the center and press it on the Fontanelle bone.

02:09:00.772 --> 02:09:04.160
You will have to rotate it seven times. That's it, that's the task.

02:09:04.681 --> 02:09:07.490
Now which chakras are these, I will tell you.

02:09:07.733 --> 02:09:09.254
This is the Heart Chakra.

02:09:09.455 --> 02:09:12.863
And this is Tattva of Guru. Below is theTattva of Shudh Vidya.

02:09:13.293 --> 02:09:15.417
After awakening all these chakras,

02:09:15.618 --> 02:09:17.965
we will come up, when we reach Shudh Vidhya.

02:09:18.956 --> 02:09:22.238
It is absolutely easy. Please take off your glasses etc.,

02:09:22.334 --> 02:09:24.028
and sit comfortably.

02:09:24.116 --> 02:09:27.367
It doesn't mean that you have to loosen your body in any way.

02:09:27.568 --> 02:09:28.624
Keep your body straight.

02:09:28.902 --> 02:09:33.858
But if anything is tight loosen it.

02:09:34.985 --> 02:09:38.292
Take off your glasses, because the eyes are closed throughout.

02:09:38.356 --> 02:09:39.296
Take off your glasses, it

02:09:39.497 --> 02:09:40.850
helps people to improve their eyesight.

02:09:41.051 --> 02:09:42.342
because, eyesight also can improve.

02:09:43.613 --> 02:09:44.613
All of you take off your glasses.

02:09:45.295 --> 02:09:48.039
Now, there is no need to open your eyes.

02:09:48.302 --> 02:09:49.531
Left hand towards me.

02:09:51.369 --> 02:09:53.340
keep like this, on earth, in your lap.

02:09:53.433 --> 02:09:55.012
First thing, sit comfortably.

02:09:55.909 --> 02:09:59.541
Put right hand on the heart.

02:09:59.802 --> 02:10:03.464
and close eyes, close eyes, now do not open your eyes.

02:10:03.987 --> 02:10:05.999
After closing your eyes, put your hand on your heart

02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:07.701
and ask a question,

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:12.939
In our heart, our Atma resides.

02:10:14.875 --> 02:10:18.498
So ask me a question. It is a fundamental question.

02:10:18.502 --> 02:10:19.630
It is a fundamental question.

02:10:19.765 --> 02:10:24.504
You ask: "Shri Mataji, Am i Atma?"

02:10:27.866 --> 02:10:29.786
Ask this question thrice.

02:10:30.477 --> 02:10:34.703
Because, it is true that you are Atma, but you ask this question.

02:10:56.533 --> 02:10:59.501
Now put the same hand on the upper part of your stomach.

02:11:05.478 --> 02:11:09.291
That too left hand, on the left side, on the left side.

02:11:10.752 --> 02:11:13.446
Put your right hand,

02:11:14.264 --> 02:11:17.684
on the left hand side of the upper part of your stomach.

02:11:18.677 --> 02:11:21.331
And press it. This is the Tattva of Guru.

02:11:21.348 --> 02:11:22.583
So the second question arises,

02:11:22.784 --> 02:11:25.391
if you are Atma, you are your Guru as well.

02:11:25.836 --> 02:11:29.145
So ask , "Mother, am i my own Guru?"

02:11:31.781 --> 02:11:35.285
Shri Mataji, "Am i my own Guru?"

02:11:49.876 --> 02:11:54.266
Now ask this question thrice.

02:11:58.872 --> 02:12:00.682
Now put your right hand on the lower part of the stomach,

02:12:00.883 --> 02:12:04.772
on the left side. Press and hold.

02:12:09.407 --> 02:12:12.205
Here it is the center of pure knowledge.

02:12:12.364 --> 02:12:15.233
Means God's knowledge, which is pure,

02:12:15.376 --> 02:12:19.530
God's rules and laws, are governed by this chakra,

02:12:19.731 --> 02:12:20.790
are put into action.

02:12:21.102 --> 02:12:22.565
All the work is done, with the help of this.

02:12:22.844 --> 02:12:24.344
There is one thing at this chakra,

02:12:24.447 --> 02:12:27.747
That I cannot force you.

02:12:28.417 --> 02:12:32.754
You will have to say, "Mother, Please give us pure knowledge."

02:12:32.955 --> 02:12:34.278
It cannot be forced on you.

02:12:34.747 --> 02:12:41.462
So, please say," Mother, Please give us pure knowledge".

02:12:42.428 --> 02:12:43.519
Say this six times,

02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:47.741
because this chakra has six parts

02:12:47.964 --> 02:12:49.752
which are called six petals.

02:12:50.110 --> 02:12:54.205
It is considered like a lotus and it has six petals.

02:12:56.061 --> 02:13:02.761
So, "Oh Mother, Shri Mataji, please give us pure knowledge".

02:13:12.206 --> 02:13:13.789
Say it six times.

02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:24.741
Now, Kundalini awakening (Jagran?) has started.

02:13:24.837 --> 02:13:29.158
So, the chakra which is of Guru Tattva,

02:13:29.238 --> 02:13:33.726
which is on the left hand side of our stomach, on the upper part,

02:13:33.927 --> 02:13:37.161
keep it pressed and say this

02:13:37.821 --> 02:13:39.201
with full confidence,

02:13:40.788 --> 02:13:47.403
because, Kundalini has awakened and for her, to help her,

02:13:47.604 --> 02:13:51.472
to help her you should say that

02:13:52.632 --> 02:13:57.157
"Shri Mataji, I am my own master".

02:13:57.490 --> 02:14:03.899
With full confidence, Shri Mataji, "I am my own master".

02:14:04.100 --> 02:14:08.032
Say with full confidence with eyes closed, with full confidence,

02:14:08.374 --> 02:14:10.513
"I am my own Guru" because

02:14:10.714 --> 02:14:12.518
it is very important that Guru Tattva should be opened

02:14:31.274 --> 02:14:32.953
You will have to say ten times.

02:14:46.006 --> 02:14:48.957
You are not doing anything, how will you be benefitted?

02:14:49.766 --> 02:14:50.837
Do it!

02:14:51.746 --> 02:14:53.722
How will your attention go ?

02:14:54.789 --> 02:14:57.357
Then, why were you wasting my time unnecessarily ?

02:14:57.777 --> 02:15:01.047
Either you do or you go. You should not do it like that. very bad !

02:15:17.374 --> 02:15:20.306
You won't be benefited by doing all this discussion (Dalilein?).

02:15:34.123 --> 02:15:36.922
Now, put this hand on your heart.

02:15:38.811 --> 02:15:41.243
Putting your hand on heart, you

02:15:45.339 --> 02:15:49.240
with full confidence, say this Param Satya.

02:15:49.866 --> 02:15:51.637
It has to be said twelve times.

02:15:51.838 --> 02:15:57.309
Shri Mataji, " I am the Spirit ! Shri Mataji, I am the Spirit !"

02:15:57.510 --> 02:16:01.819
Shri Mataji, "I am the Spirit !" Say it twelve times.

02:16:47.740 --> 02:16:48.740
Now,

02:16:51.681 --> 02:16:54.482
Put the same right hand, on your shoulder.

02:16:55.244 --> 02:17:00.204
Here, between neck and shoulder there is a corner. On that corner,

02:17:01.462 --> 02:17:06.660
upto much distance keep holding your neck

02:17:06.861 --> 02:17:11.496
and turn your neck to the right side.

02:17:15.832 --> 02:17:16.832
Right side.

02:17:19.813 --> 02:17:22.983
This is Shri Krishna's Vishuddhi Chakra.

02:17:23.992 --> 02:17:28.742
Here to get the witness state there is only one mantra,

02:17:29.126 --> 02:17:31.501
that "Shri Mataji, I am not guilty".

02:17:31.730 --> 02:17:33.167
"Mother, i am not guilty".

02:17:35.956 --> 02:17:37.516
Say it sixteen times.

02:17:42.969 --> 02:17:48.609
God is an ocean of kindness and love.

02:17:48.978 --> 02:17:51.378
But more than anything he is an ocean of forgiveness.

02:17:51.797 --> 02:17:55.551
In front of His forgiveness, none of our defects can remain.

02:17:56.031 --> 02:17:58.120
So, I am guilty, I have done this mistake,

02:17:58.321 --> 02:18:00.215
that mistake, we should not think like that.

02:18:00.920 --> 02:18:03.146
"Shri Mataji, I am not guilty".

02:18:03.996 --> 02:18:08.405
Say this sixteen times because Shri Krishna has sixteen arts (Kalaein?).

02:18:17.181 --> 02:18:19.463
Some people have come only to observe

02:18:23.911 --> 02:18:27.570
Now, place this right hand

02:18:31.133 --> 02:18:32.133
on your forehead

02:18:33.937 --> 02:18:34.937
horizontally

02:18:37.684 --> 02:18:39.684
And press it from both the sides.

02:18:40.798 --> 02:18:44.799
This is Agnya Chakra. This Agnya Chakra has two windows.

02:18:45.841 --> 02:18:49.527
On the next, we should forgive everyone.

02:18:49.727 --> 02:18:51.727
Its Bija mantra is "Ham Ksham".

02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:56.716
At this place you should forgive.

02:18:57.558 --> 02:19:01.355
"Shri Mataji, I forgive everyone", say it from your heart.

02:19:01.475 --> 02:19:03.586
It doesn't matter how many times you say it.

02:19:04.192 --> 02:19:10.458
"Shri Mataji, I forgive everyone", say it with full heart.

02:19:12.817 --> 02:19:14.568
This establishes Nirvicharita (thoughtless awareness).

02:19:27.753 --> 02:19:32.469
Now, take the same hand at the back part of your head

02:19:33.480 --> 02:19:36.015
and bend your head to the back.

02:19:38.818 --> 02:19:39.818
Here,

02:19:40.685 --> 02:19:45.578
Agnya Chakra's second Bija mantra is "Ham", meaning,

02:19:47.269 --> 02:19:52.971
"Oh God, If I have made any mistake, please fogive me"

02:19:58.136 --> 02:20:01.447
"If I have made any mistake, please fogive me"

02:20:09.750 --> 02:20:13.159
but that doesn't mean that we should feel guilty. Only say it.

02:20:14.548 --> 02:20:16.919
Now, put the same hand on your

02:20:20.054 --> 02:20:23.145
fontenale bone, place your palm,

02:20:23.367 --> 02:20:27.497
stretch it fully and keep it there.

02:20:27.698 --> 02:20:30.996
And keep the center of your palm

02:20:31.197 --> 02:20:35.590
on your fontenale bone and press the head.

02:20:36.431 --> 02:20:37.431
By pressing it,

02:20:39.133 --> 02:20:41.224
its upper layer of skin,

02:20:42.256 --> 02:20:46.996
rotate it, and seven times slowly slowly rotate it

02:20:47.197 --> 02:20:51.244
slowly slowly, not loosely, not loosely, by keeping your hand on it.

02:21:45.215 --> 02:21:46.588
Put your hands down slowly.

02:21:48.588 --> 02:21:51.824
Open your eyes slowly slowly and look at Me

02:21:52.656 --> 02:21:57.588
and don't think, don't think.

02:22:02.981 --> 02:22:09.310
Put your left hand on the top of your head like this.

02:22:10.168 --> 02:22:14.078
left, left, left, right towards me.

02:22:14.196 --> 02:22:18.303
Now see, is there any coolness coming out of your head? Feel it.

02:22:18.688 --> 02:22:21.411
Raise it a little higher. Sometimes some feel it at a higher level.

02:22:23.625 --> 02:22:28.566
Yes, right hand towards me, right towards me, check with left.

02:22:29.431 --> 02:22:32.221
This hand towards me, right hand towards me.

02:22:32.422 --> 02:22:35.746
This hand towards me, right, check with left.

02:22:37.557 --> 02:22:38.557
No No

02:22:39.188 --> 02:22:42.323
This right hand, put it towards me.

02:22:43.109 --> 02:22:45.073
Check it with your left hand.

02:22:46.120 --> 02:22:48.474
Now put your left hand towards me.

02:22:51.570 --> 02:22:53.613
And check with your right hand. Check.

02:22:55.145 --> 02:22:57.740
Attention here ! Left hand towards me.

02:23:00.073 --> 02:23:01.451
Check with the right hand on top of your head.

02:23:02.443 --> 02:23:08.447
Are you getting anything? A little air? It must be hot at this time.

02:23:09.133 --> 02:23:12.911
Doesn't matter. Now again right hand towards me.

02:23:14.681 --> 02:23:18.463
Now check again, Saleelam Saleelam!

02:23:23.153 --> 02:23:27.031
Is it there? Raise your hand higher and check.

02:23:28.310 --> 02:23:30.775
Now take your both the hands upwards, and throw head backwards,

02:23:30.976 --> 02:23:33.174
ask a question,

02:23:33.760 --> 02:23:37.414
"Oh Mother, is this Bramhashakti?"

02:23:38.804 --> 02:23:41.732
"Is this God's power of love?"

02:23:43.263 --> 02:23:49.657
"Is this Omkar Shakti?" Raising your neck like this, ask thrice.

02:23:52.552 --> 02:23:54.937
Yes, put your hands down.

02:23:56.097 --> 02:23:57.513
Put your hands like this.

02:23:58.799 --> 02:24:04.065
Now those who felt even a little cool breeze on their head or hands,

02:24:04.606 --> 02:24:06.038
raise both your hands.

02:24:08.911 --> 02:24:11.355
Those who have got, honestly.

02:24:14.535 --> 02:24:17.102
It seems most of them have got it, here all of them have got it,

02:24:20.193 --> 02:24:23.371
Yes did you get it?

02:24:23.451 --> 02:24:25.151
Sahajayoginis: He is saying maybe air is blowing

02:24:25.316 --> 02:24:28.898
Shri Mataji: With that air will you be able to cure cancer?

02:24:30.104 --> 02:24:32.287
Don't doubt, that is why you didn't get it.

02:24:32.488 --> 02:24:33.463
You should not doubt so much.

02:24:33.822 --> 02:24:35.985
If you doubt you will never get it. Have you understood ?

02:24:36.235 --> 02:24:38.834
All of them are not fools, those who are saying. Isn't it?

02:24:39.025 --> 02:24:40.932
Now check, are you not getting? Check.

02:24:41.133 --> 02:24:42.954
Don't doubt, its a wrongful act.

02:24:51.511 --> 02:24:52.632
Are you getting it?

02:24:54.944 --> 02:24:56.971
Now say,"I am sorry, I doubted it"

02:24:57.172 --> 02:24:58.729
Just one time say only this and you will get it just now.

02:25:00.113 --> 02:25:02.930
It is intelligence, pure intelligence.

02:25:04.084 --> 02:25:06.126
Yes is it coming ? Did you get it or not ?

02:25:06.327 --> 02:25:09.242
See wasn't it a mistake ? Now check it with this hand.

02:25:09.727 --> 02:25:11.985
Don't doubt it. If you doubt it will stop coming up.

02:25:12.779 --> 02:25:14.882
Say it was a mistake that I doubted it.

02:25:15.461 --> 02:25:16.766
Say only this much and it will be done.

02:25:16.967 --> 02:25:18.348
See how easily it was done

02:25:18.586 --> 02:25:19.586
Are you getting it, son ?

02:25:19.836 --> 02:25:22.812
Are you getting it? Now check his, who is sitting beside you.

02:25:23.439 --> 02:25:26.070
He is he not getting coolness? Didn't you get?

02:25:27.380 --> 02:25:28.713
He, who is sitting in the front.

02:25:29.896 --> 02:25:32.408
He was doing it halfheartedly.

02:25:33.408 --> 02:25:36.059
And who else hasn't got? Raise your hands.

02:25:40.420 --> 02:25:41.583
You didn't get it, son?

02:25:43.500 --> 02:25:45.719
Hmm, you didn't you get it?

02:25:47.295 --> 02:25:48.866
This person who is wearing white?

02:25:52.310 --> 02:25:53.310
Just check.

02:25:56.838 --> 02:25:58.722
You have got it.

02:26:02.501 --> 02:26:03.501
You didn't get?

02:26:06.410 --> 02:26:09.077
Where do you live?

02:26:10.213 --> 02:26:11.213
Shri Mataji: Where?

02:26:11.439 --> 02:26:14.554
From here only? What happened then?

02:26:17.260 --> 02:26:21.819
You got it in hands, not on top of your head ?

02:26:22.534 --> 02:26:24.544
Ok if you are not getting it on top of your head,

02:26:24.745 --> 02:26:26.575
Say, "Mother you come in my head."

02:26:26.776 --> 02:26:28.490
Say this with your hands like this.

02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:33.755
Say, if you are not getting over your head, see the magic.

02:26:34.390 --> 02:26:37.124
Say, "Mother, please come into my brain." Say it seven times.

02:26:39.299 --> 02:26:40.981
You can ask for everything.

02:26:46.378 --> 02:26:47.378
Mark, has he got it?

02:26:55.279 --> 02:27:00.235
Yes ! now,  Got it now ! Did you get it?

02:27:01.172 --> 02:27:06.200
Yes, it is slightly less, it will come up, just tie him up a little.

02:27:06.930 --> 02:27:08.268
Now see, you will get it forcefully !

02:27:11.038 --> 02:27:12.038
Is it better?

02:27:14.943 --> 02:27:16.946
Somebody is playing a magical trick from behind you.

02:27:20.987 --> 02:27:27.768
Now say, is it better? No? Check it.

02:27:28.465 --> 02:27:29.465
Seeker: A little bit came.

02:27:33.838 --> 02:27:36.582
Are you getting it? He didn't get it.

02:27:36.783 --> 02:27:39.336
Who didn't get it?

02:27:39.537 --> 02:27:40.724
Sahaja Yogini: He is saying a little bit has come.

02:27:42.034 --> 02:27:43.034
Shri Mataji: You didn't get?

02:27:45.264 --> 02:27:48.045
Seeker: Hands are cool. Hands have cool feeling.

02:27:48.157 --> 02:27:50.989
Now your hands are cool in summer.

02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:53.499
Now say, "Mother, come in my head ! " Go ahead.

02:27:54.604 --> 02:27:58.766
Everybody say it because everybody's head is very heavy.

02:27:59.184 --> 02:28:01.862
Isn't it? The head is loaded with everything, with lot of things.

02:28:02.412 --> 02:28:03.151
In the brain.

02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:06.161
If you have read newspaper today, brain will be all the more bad.

02:28:07.422 --> 02:28:08.422
Yes,{LONG PAUSE}

02:28:13.882 --> 02:28:15.021
Ask for it ! {LONG PAUSE}

02:28:20.523 --> 02:28:21.523
Now? {LONG PAUSE}

02:28:26.031 --> 02:28:27.031
Did you get it now?

02:28:29.956 --> 02:28:32.741
Put your attention here. Did you get it?

02:28:34.340 --> 02:28:36.741
Didn't come? It's a (inaudible) catch.

02:28:39.035 --> 02:28:41.572
What's it? What is the matter with him? {LONG PAUSE}

02:28:47.222 --> 02:28:49.122
Ok, those who have not got it

02:28:50.581 --> 02:28:52.662
those people, and those who have got it

02:28:52.863 --> 02:28:54.614
all of them should come to the center.

02:28:55.712 --> 02:28:57.668
Today it was not expected

02:28:58.042 --> 02:28:59.911
that you will come, new people will come,

02:29:00.112 --> 02:29:02.381
otherwise we would have done that programme first.

02:29:02.691 --> 02:29:03.991
Question: Where is the center, Shri Mataji?

02:29:04.086 --> 02:29:07.161
Center, I don't know. Where is the center?

02:29:07.805 --> 02:29:11.082
Now you write down, all of you and all of you come.

02:29:11.283 --> 02:29:14.526
Check it and make it strong, strong.

02:29:14.727 --> 02:29:39.227
Sahajayogi: (inaudible)

02:29:39.573 --> 02:29:41.258
Shri Mataji: No No but let them not read it today.

02:29:41.973 --> 02:29:44.798
If they read it today, then they will be gone.

02:29:46.437 --> 02:29:48.147
Let them read it next time.

02:29:48.348 --> 02:29:51.120
You take it. Read it after you strengthen yourself

02:29:51.321 --> 02:29:53.336
otherwise you will get confused.

02:29:53.537 --> 02:30:28.331
Sahajayogi: (inaudible)

02:30:28.532 --> 02:30:31.790
Shri Mataji:Ok, now in Hindi. Tell him in English

02:30:31.991 --> 02:30:35.155

Shri Mataji: Today also, you take the photo,

02:31:12.579 --> 02:31:14.416
by working on the photo it may work out.

02:31:14.986 --> 02:31:18.560
Sahaja Yogi: Here we have Shri Mataji's photograph and

02:31:18.761 --> 02:31:21.928
along with that a booklet, in Hindi as well as in English.

02:31:22.133 --> 02:31:26.761
Whichever you want you can take (by?)

02:31:30.669 --> 02:31:34.539
Shri Mataji: And don't doubt, about yourself or about Me

02:31:34.745 --> 02:31:39.155
because I didn't charge you any money, so there is no need to doubt.

02:31:39.442 --> 02:31:40.442
Isn't it?

02:31:43.080 --> 02:31:49.523
Without doubting, kindly work hard on photo.

02:31:49.724 --> 02:31:52.090
And I am cofident, that those who have come today,

02:31:52.291 --> 02:31:54.777
are special people and will get it nicely.

02:31:55.038 --> 02:31:59.140
When I will come next time, I will find big trees grown up.

02:32:10.238 --> 02:32:16.218
Yes, in heart?

02:32:16.321 --> 02:32:23.055
Say,"Mother please come to my heart".

02:32:35.429 --> 02:32:37.689
Say "Mother please come into my head".

02:32:37.890 --> 02:32:39.685
Did you have a guru previously?

02:33:07.730 --> 02:33:13.840
Shri Mataji: You have got it. Check it on your head.

02:33:14.022 --> 02:33:21.506
Do you feel cool breeze in head?

02:33:21.707 --> 02:33:25.000
Hot or cold?
