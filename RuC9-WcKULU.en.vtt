00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.610
First thing to note is that on the night of new-moon and full-moon,

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.480
always there are dangers on your left and right sides.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:25.760
Specially on these two days, that is, the nights of new
moon and full moon, you should sleep very early at night.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.960
After singing bhajans, bow down before the photograph, meditate,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.069
and keep your attention on Sahasrara
and go to sleep after taking bandhan.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.260
That means you go into the unconscious the
moment your attention is at your Sahasrara.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.380
There, give yourself a bandhan and you are saved.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.271
During these two nights it should be observed particularly.

00:00:50.352 --> 00:00:57.251
The night of new moon, you should meditate especially on Shri Shiva.

00:00:57.332 --> 00:01:04.352
You should sleep after meditating on Shri Shiva

00:01:04.432 --> 00:01:12.151
– that is the Spirit – and completely surrender yourself to Him.

00:01:12.232 --> 00:01:17.532
On the night of full moon, you should meditate on
Shri Rama and surrender yourself to Him for protection.

00:01:17.613 --> 00:01:24.497
The meaning of the word Ramchandra is “creativity”.

00:01:24.578 --> 00:01:29.798
You should completely dedicate your creative powers to Him.

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:33.649
Thus you have to take special care of yourself on these two days.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:43.764
However on the seventh and ninth days of Lunar fortnights
(according to the Indian Calendar “saptami” and “navami”)

00:01:43.845 --> 00:01:45.235
you have my special blessings.

00:01:45.316 --> 00:01:54.236
Remember that you are specially blessed by Me on these two days.

00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:59.880
Make some special arrangements so that
you can have proper meditation on these days.
