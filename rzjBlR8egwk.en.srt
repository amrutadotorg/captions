1
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:20,871
Today we have gathered here to do Puja to Bhairavnath.

2
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,924
I think we have not understood

3
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:31,572
the significance of Bhairavnath

4
00:04:31,732 --> 00:04:41,415
who runs, and up and down on the Ida Nadi.

5
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:18,301
Ida Nadi is the Nadi of Chandrama, is of the moon.

6
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:34,167
So, this is a channel for us to cool down.

7
00:05:40,983 --> 00:05:48,861
So the work of Bhairavnathji is to cool us down.

8
00:05:54,764 --> 00:05:59,234
For example, people have a hot temper,

9
00:05:59,394 --> 00:06:03,667
with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is.

10
00:06:12,135 --> 00:06:19,154
And if a person is in a big temper,

11
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:25,166
then Bhairavnath plays tricks on that person

12
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:27,922
to cool him down.

13
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:43,271
He organises everything under his own control

14
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:46,765
with ganas help, with Ganapati's help,

15
00:06:46,925 --> 00:06:51,791
to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance.

16
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,263
So, if somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

17
00:07:08,966 --> 00:07:14,444
and he crosses all the limits of his temper,

18
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:17,209
then somehow or other,

19
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:20,459
Bhairavnath will organize,

20
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:23,736
also with the help of Hanumana,

21
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:30,136
to show that this stupidity of anger is no good.

22
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:56,773
So, for example, people who are depressed

23
00:07:56,933 --> 00:07:59,568
or who become left-sided,

24
00:07:59,728 --> 00:08:05,694
Hanumana tries to help them to come out of it.

25
00:08:05,854 --> 00:08:12,054
No doubt, but also Bhairavnath helps them

26
00:08:12,214 --> 00:08:16,173
very much more to come out of it.

27
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:36,537
Now, a person who is left-sided cannot be collective.

28
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:44,556
It is very difficult for a person

29
00:08:44,716 --> 00:08:48,441
who is very left-sided,

30
00:08:48,601 --> 00:08:54,354
who is all the time feeling very sad,

31
00:08:54,514 --> 00:08:57,790
unhappy and worried,

32
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,995
cannot enjoy the fun of collectivity.

33
00:09:14,507 --> 00:09:18,023
While a hot-tempered person, a right-sided person,

34
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,460
does not enjoy any collectivity,

35
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,113
doesn't allow anybody to enjoy collectivity, no doubt,

36
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:28,341
but tries to be in the collective that it can assert.

37
00:09:42,843 --> 00:09:46,073
Because such a person tries to show the superiority,

38
00:09:46,233 --> 00:09:48,096
is something superior.

39
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:53,560
Naturally he cannot enjoy the collective.

40
00:10:02,075 --> 00:10:06,276
On the contrary, the person who is depressed,

41
00:10:06,436 --> 00:10:08,423
all the time thinks,

42
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:11,180
"Nobody loves me, nobody cares for me,

43
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,430
I'm so depressed," this, that,

44
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,734
all the time expecting from others something,

45
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:22,187
also cannot enjoy the collective.

46
00:10:39,937 --> 00:10:42,259
Such a left-sided person will find

47
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:48,842
everything is something unhappy.

48
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:59,715
Like the other day, I went to Moscow.

49
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:03,941
There was a lady with us who was a Sahaja Yogini,

50
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:07,507
left-sided Sahaja Yogini.

51
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,922
So, we went to have our food

52
00:11:18,082 --> 00:11:23,028
and it started raining and they couldn't get a taxi,

53
00:11:31,295 --> 00:11:34,852
but then a car came in and we went there.

54
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:41,954
Then they said that

55
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:45,242
"You are very late so you have to sit on the other side,

56
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:49,367
you have to take the seats which were more expensive."

57
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,488
So this lady started saying,

58
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:05,771
"What all problems, no taxi, it is raining

59
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:09,163
and we can't get a seat."

60
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,066
I said, "This is all fun;

61
00:12:21,226 --> 00:12:23,655
this is not something a problem."

62
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:27,384
This 'problema' word should be given up.

63
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:38,854
This is a new word I have learned,

64
00:12:39,014 --> 00:12:43,363
because 'problem' we used to use only for geometry

65
00:12:43,523 --> 00:12:45,787
in our young age.

66
00:12:56,285 --> 00:12:59,804
Now, this sort of a attitude, negative attitude,

67
00:12:59,964 --> 00:13:02,753
to find everything negative

68
00:13:02,913 --> 00:13:09,234
is the way we really spoil our left side.

69
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:20,881
But then a gentleman who had invited us came

70
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:26,608
and he said, "We are sitting on the other side waiting for you.'

71
00:13:36,386 --> 00:13:39,044
So we went to the other side, enjoyed nice food,

72
00:13:39,204 --> 00:13:40,614
everything was fine.

73
00:13:40,774 --> 00:13:43,038
I said, "See now, you were only counting

74
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,430
how many negative things there are,

75
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,668
and you were not seeing the fun."

76
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,088
So she asked Me, "What should I do?" I said,

77
00:14:06,248 --> 00:14:09,376
"You take Bhairava's name,

78
00:14:13,975 --> 00:14:15,963
sit with your left hand towards the photograph

79
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:17,850
and right hand on the Mother Earth

80
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:22,055
and that's how all your bhoots of negativity will go away."

81
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:31,884
So, Bhairava is, always has a light in His hand,

82
00:14:32,044 --> 00:14:35,174
always light in His hand.

83
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,823
And He runs up and down

84
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:51,113
Ida Nadi to make light for you to see that there's nothing negative.

85
00:14:58,304 --> 00:15:02,971
And this negativity comes to us by many ways.

86
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:10,901
One of the negativities are that,

87
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:14,378
"This is mine",

88
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:27,744
like, "My child, my husband, my property, my ..."

89
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:35,020
So then, you see, once you get attached

90
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,359
in this manner, what you find,

91
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:44,754
that your children also become negative.

92
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:58,492
But if you want to be positive, it is very easy.

93
00:16:01,845 --> 00:16:07,269
And for that you should see, 'Where is your attention?"

94
00:16:10,629 --> 00:16:13,204
Are you only seeing problema

95
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:17,539
or you are seeing some fun in it?

96
00:16:26,247 --> 00:16:31,510
There are people who cannot make fun out of anything.

97
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:40,936
If it's a sunny day they'll cry, "Oh God, what a sunny day!"

98
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,451
and if it is a day with clouds they will say,

99
00:16:50,611 --> 00:16:52,683
"Oh, what a day!"

100
00:16:56,562 --> 00:16:59,608
Nothing can please them.

101
00:17:00,869 --> 00:17:07,071
But to enjoy the positivity in every negativity

102
00:17:07,231 --> 00:17:10,796
is the capacity of a Sahaja Yogi.

103
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,647
The negativity doesn't exist - it's an ignorance.

104
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,800
Also, it's not ignorance, because ignorance also doesn't exist.

105
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,158
If everything is the All-Pervading Power,

106
00:17:34,318 --> 00:17:38,474
then how can there be ignorance?

107
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:50,818
But supposing, in the folds of this power,

108
00:17:50,978 --> 00:17:53,255
if you hide, run away,

109
00:17:53,415 --> 00:17:57,642
you will say that there is negativity.

110
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,131
Like, you hide yourself in a cave,

111
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:12,696
close it properly, and say that there is no sun.

112
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:22,085
So those people who cannot become collective,

113
00:18:22,245 --> 00:18:28,181
are either right-sided or left- sided but more left-sided.

114
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:42,767
But left- sided people can be collective in negativity.

115
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,651
They say, there is a very big fraternity of bhoots.

116
00:18:54,064 --> 00:19:00,505
Ah, you see some drunkards sitting together.

117
00:19:03,581 --> 00:19:08,728
They are saying, "See there're so many problem, ecological problem."

118
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:11,027
They are drunkards, all drunk,

119
00:19:11,187 --> 00:19:15,033
and "There are problems of so other kinds.

120
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:19,258
When will this end?"

121
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,202
So the another one says, "Wait, wait, wait.

122
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:36,451
I've heard that the whole world is going to collapse very soon."

123
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:47,889
Then the third one says,

124
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:52,323
"Thank God! We are going to be collapsed, finished."

125
00:19:54,853 --> 00:20:01,826
Then fourth one says, "But what will happen to our pubs?"

126
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:12,436
They say, "It's all right. If we are not existing, what does it matter?"

127
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,592
That's how the fraternity of the bhoots act.

128
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:25,682
They cannot see fun at all,

129
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,035
they cannot enjoy at all,

130
00:20:32,424 --> 00:20:34,878
and they become very,

131
00:20:34,982 --> 00:20:37,452
sort of think they are very meditative,

132
00:20:37,588 --> 00:20:41,418
they are some higher people, they are something superior

133
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:44,548
in negativity.

134
00:20:56,570 --> 00:21:01,669
But, end of these people is that they become lunatics,

135
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:10,230
while the end of the right-sided - they become idiotic.

136
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:18,160
Once I went to a lunatic asylum,

137
00:21:20,506 --> 00:21:23,802
and while going there I met a lady,

138
00:21:23,962 --> 00:21:26,670
and she was quite all right, I mean,

139
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:29,195
I thought she was a quite all right woman,

140
00:21:29,283 --> 00:21:32,579
so I started talking to her.

141
00:21:40,262 --> 00:21:42,271
And she started talking very wisely:

142
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:44,810
"See, my brother- in- law is there, and

143
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,289
I think it isn't necessary that he should be helped,

144
00:21:48,449 --> 00:21:50,156
and we should not do this, that..."

145
00:21:50,316 --> 00:21:54,413
All kinds of things she was telling Me,

146
00:22:02,024 --> 00:22:05,544
showing Me, as if she was very nice and kind

147
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:09,161
and no one loves her.

148
00:22:15,224 --> 00:22:19,155
And she said, "I'm very insecure" and this and that.

149
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,683
Suddenly the doctor came in

150
00:22:27,116 --> 00:22:30,694
and she started abusing him, shouting at him.

151
00:22:30,854 --> 00:22:34,040
I said, "What's this?"

152
00:22:40,676 --> 00:22:43,478
So the doctor sent for people that,

153
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:45,187
"Catch hold of this woman!"

154
00:22:45,347 --> 00:22:49,521
He told Me, "She's the most violent lunatic

155
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:58,664
and why are You talking to her?"

156
00:22:59,346 --> 00:23:05,188
I did have a headache but I didn't know she was a lunatic.

157
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:12,072
Maybe in My presence, her bhoots might have a little bit

158
00:23:12,232 --> 00:23:14,290
run away and were playing tricks,

159
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:19,019
but you can see that, clearly.

160
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:27,516
So, this emotional attachment is too much,

161
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:31,566
and to emotionally, to worry about somebody, that

162
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:36,244
"You see, "This is my child, this is my this thing,

163
00:23:36,404 --> 00:23:38,080
this is this and this is that,"

164
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,888
and all the time wasting your precious life

165
00:23:41,048 --> 00:23:46,179
in these things is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should live.

166
00:23:57,075 --> 00:23:59,425
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot become collective,

167
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:03,365
then know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

168
00:24:09,831 --> 00:24:11,522
So, one has to know that

169
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:15,869
this is the work of Bhairavnath within us.

170
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:22,888
Another work that He gives us light in darkness is that,

171
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:30,188
that He, He destroys all the bhoots within us.

172
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,648
And all kinds of bhootish ideas

173
00:24:41,173 --> 00:24:45,927
and funny ideas about attachments

174
00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:52,699
and also the depressiveness.

175
00:24:54,354 --> 00:24:55,909
So, today we are, I am very happy

176
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:59,809
that we are worshipping Shri Bhairava

177
00:24:59,969 --> 00:25:05,337
because He is very much connected with Ganesha.

178
00:25:11,225 --> 00:25:14,727
As you know Shri Ganesha is at the Mooladhara

179
00:25:14,887 --> 00:25:18,996
and while Bhairava moves onto the left side

180
00:25:19,156 --> 00:25:23,180
and goes to the right side.

181
00:25:29,684 --> 00:25:34,092
So, all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits,

182
00:25:34,252 --> 00:25:40,945
can be conquered through the help of Bhairavnath.

183
00:25:48,535 --> 00:25:53,672
In Nepal we have a very huge, big Bhairavnath’s statue

184
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:57,733
which is really Swayambhu.

185
00:26:01,496 --> 00:26:04,011
And people are more left-sided,

186
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:07,737
so they are afraid of Bhairavnath.

187
00:26:11,816 --> 00:26:15,701
So, if somebody has a bad habit, say, of stealing,

188
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:18,568
they take him to the, to in front of Bhairavnath

189
00:26:18,728 --> 00:26:24,113
and put His light there, make a flame.

190
00:26:33,037 --> 00:26:34,945
I mean, the police takes them.

191
00:26:35,058 --> 00:26:41,437
And then they ask him, "Now, say before Bhairavnath, confess it."

192
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,826
And they confess what wrong they have done.

193
00:26:51,986 --> 00:27:01,678
So, He protect us, also from doing wrong things,

194
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:05,339
sly things like thieving.

195
00:27:12,812 --> 00:27:15,874
Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden,

196
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:20,267
but you cannot hide it from Bhairavnath.

197
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:31,677
If you don't change, then He exposes you completely.

198
00:27:34,341 --> 00:27:40,225
That's how He has exposed  all the horrible false gurus.

199
00:27:44,034 --> 00:27:48,146
So, today we are here to worship

200
00:27:48,306 --> 00:27:50,748
this great Deity of Bhiaravnatha

201
00:27:50,908 --> 00:27:55,481
who incarnated on this earth later on,

202
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,948
ultimately as Mahavira also.

203
00:28:08,082 --> 00:28:12,840
So, He stands on the gate of hell

204
00:28:15,785 --> 00:28:19,886
and stops people from falling into hell.

205
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:26,808
But if you want to go to hell,

206
00:28:26,968 --> 00:28:30,096
if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working,

207
00:28:30,256 --> 00:28:31,803
that I should go to hell, then He says,

208
00:28:31,963 --> 00:28:35,852
'All right, you can go.'

209
00:28:42,093 --> 00:28:48,563
But as you know, now the hell is also full of people.

210
00:28:52,382 --> 00:28:58,464
So, it’s better that we should try to fight our negativity

211
00:28:58,624 --> 00:29:05,528
and become fun-loving, enjoying others, loving others,

212
00:29:17,977 --> 00:29:21,849
not worrying about what others are doing to you,

213
00:29:22,009 --> 00:29:27,273
but only thinking what good you can do to others.

214
00:29:36,303 --> 00:29:43,755
So today's special Puja for Bhairavnath we offer,

215
00:29:46,788 --> 00:29:53,918
to give us a sense to laugh, to enjoy, to have fun.

216
00:30:02,476 --> 00:30:06,046
May God bless you all.
