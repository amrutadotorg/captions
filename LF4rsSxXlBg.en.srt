1
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:21,653
Today we have gathered here to do Puja to Bhairavnath.

2
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:26,706
I think we have not understood

3
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:32,354
the significance of Bhairavnath

4
00:00:32,514 --> 00:00:42,197
who runs, and up and down on the Ida Nadi.

5
00:01:12,247 --> 00:01:19,083
Ida Nadi is the Nadi of Chandrama, is of the moon.

6
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:34,949
So, this is a channel for us to cool down.

7
00:01:41,765 --> 00:01:49,643
So the work of Bhairavnathji is to cool us down.

8
00:01:55,546 --> 00:02:00,016
For example, people have a hot temper,

9
00:02:00,176 --> 00:02:04,449
with their ego, with their liver, whatever it is.

10
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:19,936
And if a person is in a big temper,

11
00:02:20,096 --> 00:02:25,948
then Bhairavnath plays tricks on that person

12
00:02:26,153 --> 00:02:28,704
to cool him down.

13
00:02:37,036 --> 00:02:44,053
He organises everything under his own control

14
00:02:44,213 --> 00:02:47,547
with ganas help, with Ganapati's help,

15
00:02:47,707 --> 00:02:52,573
to cool down your temperament, to give you a balance.

16
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:09,045
So, if somebody is a very hot-tempered person,

17
00:03:09,748 --> 00:03:15,226
and he crosses all the limits of his temper,

18
00:03:15,386 --> 00:03:17,991
then somehow or other,

19
00:03:18,151 --> 00:03:21,241
Bhairavnath will organize,

20
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,518
also with the help of Hanumana,

21
00:03:24,678 --> 00:03:30,918
to show that this stupidity of anger is no good.

22
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:57,555
So, for example, people who are depressed

23
00:03:57,715 --> 00:04:00,350
or who become left-sided,

24
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:06,476
Hanumana tries to help them to come out of it.

25
00:04:06,636 --> 00:04:12,836
No doubt, but also Bhairavnath helps them

26
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:16,955
very much more to come out of it.

27
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:37,319
Now, a person who is left-sided cannot be collective.

28
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:45,338
It is very difficult for a person

29
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:49,223
who is very left-sided,

30
00:04:49,383 --> 00:04:55,136
who is all the time feeling very sad,

31
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:58,572
unhappy and worried,

32
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:02,777
cannot enjoy the fun of collectivity.

33
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:18,805
While a hot-tempered person, a right-sided person,

34
00:05:18,965 --> 00:05:21,242
does not enjoy any collectivity,

35
00:05:21,402 --> 00:05:23,895
doesn’t allow anybody to enjoy collectivity, no doubt,

36
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:29,123
but tries to be in the collective that it can assert.

37
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:46,855
Because such a person tries to show the superiority,

38
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:48,878
is something superior.

39
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,342
Naturally he cannot enjoy the collective.

40
00:06:02,857 --> 00:06:07,058
On the contrary, the person who is depressed,

41
00:06:07,218 --> 00:06:09,205
all the time thinks,

42
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:11,962
"Nobody loves me, nobody cares for me,

43
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,212
I'm so depressed,” this, that,

44
00:06:14,372 --> 00:06:17,516
all the time expecting from others something,

45
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:22,969
also cannot enjoy the collective.

46
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:43,041
Such a left-sided person will find

47
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:49,624
everything is something unhappy.

48
00:06:57,843 --> 00:07:00,497
Like the other day, I went to Moscow.

49
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:04,723
There was a lady with us who was a Sahaja Yogini,

50
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:08,289
left-sided Sahaja Yogini.

51
00:07:15,362 --> 00:07:18,704
So, we went to have our food

52
00:07:18,864 --> 00:07:23,810
and it started raining and they couldn't get a taxi,

53
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,634
but then a car came in and we went there.

54
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:42,736
Then they said that

55
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:46,024
“You are very late so you have to sit on the other side,

56
00:07:46,184 --> 00:07:50,149
you have to take the seats which were more expensive.”

57
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,270
So this lady started saying,

58
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:06,553
"What all problems, no taxi, it is raining

59
00:08:06,713 --> 00:08:09,945
and we can't get a seat."

60
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,848
I said, “This is all fun;

61
00:08:22,008 --> 00:08:24,437
this is not something a problem.”

62
00:08:24,597 --> 00:08:28,166
This 'problema’ word should be given up.

63
00:08:36,988 --> 00:08:39,636
This is a new word I have learned,

64
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:44,145
because 'problem' we used to use only for geometry

65
00:08:44,305 --> 00:08:46,569
in our young age.

66
00:08:57,067 --> 00:09:00,586
Now, this sort of a attitude, negative attitude,

67
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:03,535
to find everything negative

68
00:09:03,695 --> 00:09:10,016
is the way we really spoil our left side.

69
00:09:19,065 --> 00:09:21,663
But then a gentleman who had invited us came

70
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:27,390
and he said, “We are sitting on the other side waiting for you.’

71
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:39,826
So we went to the other side, enjoyed nice food,

72
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:41,396
everything was fine.

73
00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:43,820
I said, “See now, you were only counting

74
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,212
how many negative things there are,

75
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,450
and you were not seeing the fun.”

76
00:10:04,952 --> 00:10:06,870
So she asked Me, "What should I do?" I said,

77
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,158
“You take Bhairava's name,

78
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:16,745
sit with your left hand towards the photograph

79
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:18,632
and right hand on the Mother Earth

80
00:10:18,792 --> 00:10:22,837
and that's how all your bhoots of negativity will go away.”

81
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:32,666
So, Bhairava is, always has a light in His hand,

82
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:35,956
always light in His hand.

83
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:44,605
And He runs up and down

84
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:51,895
Ida Nadi to make light for you to see that there's nothing negative.

85
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:03,753
And this negativity comes to us by many ways.

86
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:11,683
One of the negativities are that,

87
00:11:11,843 --> 00:11:15,160
"This is mine",

88
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:28,526
like, "My child, my husband, my property, my …”

89
00:11:33,469 --> 00:11:35,802
So then, you see, once you get attached

90
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:39,141
in this manner, what you find,

91
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:45,536
that your children also become negative.

92
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:59,274
But if you want to be positive, it is very easy.

93
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:08,051
And for that you should see, ‘Where is your attention?”

94
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:13,986
Are you only seeing problema

95
00:12:14,146 --> 00:12:18,321
or you are seeing some fun in it?

96
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:32,292
There are people who cannot make fun out of anything.

97
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:41,718
If it’s a sunny day they’ll cry, "Oh God, what a sunny day!"

98
00:12:46,662 --> 00:12:51,233
and if it is a day with clouds they will say,

99
00:12:51,393 --> 00:12:53,465
"Oh, what a day!"

100
00:12:57,344 --> 00:13:00,390
Nothing can please them.

101
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:07,853
But to enjoy the positivity in every negativity

102
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:11,578
is the capacity of a Sahaja Yogi.

103
00:13:18,861 --> 00:13:25,429
The negativity doesn't exist - it's an ignorance.

104
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:31,582
Also, it’s not ignorance, because ignorance also doesn't exist.

105
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:34,940
If everything is the All-Pervading Power,

106
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,256
then how can there be ignorance?

107
00:13:45,156 --> 00:13:51,600
But supposing, in the folds of this power,

108
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,037
if you hide, run away,

109
00:13:54,197 --> 00:13:58,424
you will say that there is negativity.

110
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,913
Like, you hide yourself in a cave,

111
00:14:08,073 --> 00:14:13,478
close it properly, and say that there is no sun.

112
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:22,867
So those people who cannot become collective,

113
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:28,963
are either right-sided or left- sided but more left-sided.

114
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:43,549
But left- sided people can be collective in negativity.

115
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:52,433
They say there is a very big fraternity of bhoots.

116
00:14:54,846 --> 00:15:01,287
Ah, you see some drunkards sitting together.

117
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:09,510
They are saying, "See there's so many problem, ecological problem."

118
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,809
They are drunkards, all drunk,

119
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:15,815
and "There are problems of so other kinds.

120
00:15:15,975 --> 00:15:20,040
When will this end?"

121
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:31,984
So the another one says, "Wait, wait, wait.

122
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:37,233
I've heard that the whole world is going to collapse very soon."

123
00:15:47,335 --> 00:15:48,671
Then the third one says,

124
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:53,105
"Thank God! We are going to be collapsed, finished."

125
00:15:55,635 --> 00:16:02,608
Then fourth one says, "But what will happen to our pubs?"

126
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:13,218
They say, "It's all right. If we are not existing, what does it matter?"

127
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:22,374
That's how the fraternity of the bhoots act.

128
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:26,464
They cannot see fun at all,

129
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:29,817
they cannot enjoy at all,

130
00:16:33,206 --> 00:16:35,660
and they become very,

131
00:16:35,764 --> 00:16:38,234
sort of think they are very meditative,

132
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,200
they are some higher people, they are something superior

133
00:16:42,186 --> 00:16:45,330
in negativity.

134
00:16:57,352 --> 00:17:02,451
But, end of these people is that they become lunatics,

135
00:17:05,254 --> 00:17:11,012
while the end of the right-sided - they become idiotic.

136
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:18,942
Once I went to a lunatic asylum,

137
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:24,584
and while going there I met a lady,

138
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:27,452
and she was quite all right, I mean,

139
00:17:27,612 --> 00:17:29,977
I thought she was a quite all right woman,

140
00:17:30,065 --> 00:17:33,361
so I started talking to her.

141
00:17:41,044 --> 00:17:43,053
And she started talking very wisely,

142
00:17:43,213 --> 00:17:45,592
"See, my brother- in- law is there, and

143
00:17:45,752 --> 00:17:49,071
isn't it necessary that he should be helped,

144
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:50,938
and we should not do this, that..."

145
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:55,195
All kinds of things she was telling Me,

146
00:18:02,806 --> 00:18:06,326
showing Me, as if she was very nice and kind

147
00:18:06,371 --> 00:18:09,943
and no one loves her.

148
00:18:16,006 --> 00:18:19,937
And she said, “I'm very insecure” and this and that.

149
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:27,465
Suddenly the doctor came in

150
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,476
and she started abusing him, shouting at him.

151
00:18:31,636 --> 00:18:34,822
I said, “What's this?”

152
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,260
So the doctor sent for people that,

153
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,969
"Catch hold of this woman!"

154
00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:50,303
He told Me, “She's the most violent lunatic

155
00:18:56,715 --> 00:18:59,446
and why are You talking to her?”

156
00:19:00,128 --> 00:19:05,970
I did have a headache but I didn't know she was a lunatic.

157
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:12,854
Maybe in My presence, as bhoot might have little bit

158
00:19:13,014 --> 00:19:15,072
run away and were playing tricks,

159
00:19:15,232 --> 00:19:19,801
but you can see that, clearly.

160
00:19:25,718 --> 00:19:28,298
So, this emotional attachment is too much,

161
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:32,348
and to emotionally, to worry about somebody, that

162
00:19:32,508 --> 00:19:37,026
you see, “This is my child, this is my this thing,

163
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:38,862
this is this and this is that,”

164
00:19:39,022 --> 00:19:41,670
and all the time wasting your precious life

165
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,961
in these things is not the way a Sahaja Yogi should live.

166
00:19:57,857 --> 00:20:00,207
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot become collective,

167
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:04,147
then know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

168
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:12,304
So, one has to know that

169
00:20:12,464 --> 00:20:16,651
this is the work of Bhairavnath within us.

170
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:23,670
Another work that He gives us light in darkness is that,

171
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:30,970
that He, He destroys all the bhoots within us.

172
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:40,430
And all kinds of bhootish ideas

173
00:20:41,955 --> 00:20:46,709
and funny ideas about attachments

174
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:53,481
and also the depressiveness.

175
00:20:55,136 --> 00:20:56,691
So, today we are, I am very happy

176
00:20:56,851 --> 00:21:00,591
that we are worshipping Shri Bhairava

177
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:06,119
because He is very much connected with Ganesha.

178
00:21:12,007 --> 00:21:15,509
As you know Shri Ganesha is at the Mooladhara

179
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:19,778
and while Bhairava moves onto the left side

180
00:21:19,938 --> 00:21:23,962
and goes to the right side.

181
00:21:30,466 --> 00:21:34,874
So, all kinds of conditionings, all kinds of habits,

182
00:21:35,034 --> 00:21:41,727
can be conquered through the help of Bhairavnath.

183
00:21:49,317 --> 00:21:54,454
In Nepal we have a very huge, big Bhairavnath statue

184
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:58,515
which is really Swayambhu.

185
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:04,793
And people are more left-sided,

186
00:22:04,953 --> 00:22:08,519
so they are afraid of Bhairavnath.

187
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:16,483
So, if somebody has a bad habit, say, of stealing,

188
00:22:16,643 --> 00:22:19,350
they take him to the, to in front of Bhairavnath

189
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,895
and put His light there, make a flame.

190
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,727
I mean, the police takes them,

191
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:42,219
and then they ask them, "Now, say before Bhairavnath, confess it."

192
00:22:47,542 --> 00:22:52,608
And they confess what wrong they have done.

193
00:22:52,768 --> 00:23:02,460
So, He protect us, also from doing wrong things,

194
00:23:02,567 --> 00:23:06,121
sly things like thieving.

195
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:16,656
Whatever we think we can do secretly, can be hidden,

196
00:23:16,816 --> 00:23:21,049
but you cannot hide it from Bhairavnath.

197
00:23:27,381 --> 00:23:32,459
If you don't change, then He exposes you completely.

198
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:41,007
That's how He has exposed  all the horrible false gurus.

199
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:48,928
So, today we are here to worship

200
00:23:49,088 --> 00:23:51,530
this great Deity of Bhiaravnatha

201
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:56,263
who incarnated on this earth later on,

202
00:24:04,222 --> 00:24:07,730
ultimately as Mahavira also.

203
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:13,622
So, He stands on the gate of hell

204
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:20,668
and stops people from falling into hell.

205
00:24:25,191 --> 00:24:27,590
But if you want to go to hell,

206
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,878
if it is your desire, is your willpower like that working,

207
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:32,585
that I should go to hell,then He says,

208
00:24:32,745 --> 00:24:36,634
‘All right, you can go.’

209
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:49,345
But as you know, now the hell is also full of people,

210
00:24:53,164 --> 00:24:59,246
so is better that we should try to fight our negativity

211
00:24:59,406 --> 00:25:06,310
and become fun-loving, enjoying others, loving others,

212
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:22,631
not worrying about what others are doing to you,

213
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:28,055
but only thinking what good you can do to others.

214
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:44,537
So today's special Puja for Bhairavnath we offer,

215
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:54,700
to give us a sense to laugh, to enjoy, to have fun.

216
00:26:03,258 --> 00:26:06,828
May God bless you all.
