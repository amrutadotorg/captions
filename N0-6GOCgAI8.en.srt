1
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:10,681
(Some Sahajis) don't understand what is God is.

2
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:14,514
But it's not the understanding

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,681
- in a way you understand this one little point,

4
00:00:17,098 --> 00:00:20,890
that it comes from your heart into your brain,

5
00:00:21,432 --> 00:00:24,848
not from brain to your heart.

6
00:00:27,223 --> 00:00:30,140
It comes

7
00:00:30,514 --> 00:00:33,764
as if the ambrosia of

8
00:00:34,056 --> 00:00:38,307
your bhakti covers your brain, absolutely.

9
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:42,056
Say for example,

10
00:00:42,307 --> 00:00:45,390
Shankaracharya wrote a beautiful treatise

11
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:47,015
called as "Viveka Chudamani"

12
00:00:47,307 --> 00:00:49,931
where he described what is God, this, that;

13
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:52,681
and "viveka" means the conscience,

14
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:56,806
and consciousness and all that he described quite a lot.

15
00:00:58,182 --> 00:01:00,390
But there was one horrible fellow called Sarma

16
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:03,848
who started arguing with him and he got fed up,

17
00:01:04,182 --> 00:01:05,598
Shankaracharya.

18
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,182
He said, "No use talking to them."

19
00:01:08,432 --> 00:01:11,307
So he just wrote "Saundarya Lahari."

20
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:14,472
"Saundarya Lahari" is nothing but all the mantras

21
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:15,514
praising the Mother.

22
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:18,140
He said, "Why, I know Mother, now let me praise Her.

23
00:01:18,432 --> 00:01:22,015
Nothing doing - what's the use of talking to these people?

24
00:01:22,472 --> 00:01:24,556
Stupid things, how will they understand?"

25
00:01:24,973 --> 00:01:29,472
He realized that "These people haven't got that capacity,

26
00:01:29,764 --> 00:01:34,348
that sensitivity to understand what I know."

27
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:40,098
That's the real knowledge, is to know what is God.

28
00:01:40,514 --> 00:01:42,973
And if that is God,

29
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:46,514
then how can you suspect anything,

30
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:49,848
how can you

31
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:52,806
try to analyze anything?

32
00:01:53,098 --> 00:01:56,806
It's God. It's God Almighty,

33
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:59,514
which knows everything,

34
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:01,931
which does everything,

35
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,098
which enjoys everything.

36
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:09,473
That is the one you should say is the gyana,

37
00:02:09,806 --> 00:02:11,514
is the knowledge, is the true knowledge,

38
00:02:11,806 --> 00:02:12,931
the pure knowledge.

39
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:15,473
It's not the knowledge of chakras,

40
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:17,848
not the knowledge of vibrations,

41
00:02:18,307 --> 00:02:20,098
not the knowledge of kundalini,

42
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:24,848
but the knowledge of God Almighty.

43
00:02:25,348 --> 00:02:28,931
And the knowledge of God Almighty is not mental.

44
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:30,472
Again I tell you,

45
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:35,223
it starts from your heart and goes to your brain,

46
00:02:36,015 --> 00:02:42,681
something that comes out of your experience of joy

47
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:44,390
and covers your brain.

48
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,265
So your brain cannot deny it any more.

49
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:50,473
Like the - sometimes when you have your mother,

50
00:02:50,806 --> 00:02:53,931
little mother, you know the love of your mother.

51
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:57,472
But you cannot explain, it comes from your heart

52
00:02:57,806 --> 00:02:59,223
and you say, "No, that's my mother,

53
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:02,348
she won't do like that. I know my mother very well."

54
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:04,472
The knowledge about your mother,

55
00:03:04,806 --> 00:03:07,223
the one who has given you birth;

56
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:11,098
may not be, mother may not be very good or whatever it is.

57
00:03:11,472 --> 00:03:13,806
But knowledge about God,

58
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:16,390
that He's love, that He's truth,

59
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:18,514
that He knows everything,

60
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,015
that just become part and parcel of your being, absolutely,

61
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:28,973
and that's the time we say is the nirvana.

62
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:32,764
So it's important,

63
00:03:33,098 --> 00:03:36,015
specially for the people of the West,

64
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:38,472
now open your hearts,

65
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:42,890
because it starts from the heart, not from your brain.

66
00:03:47,265 --> 00:03:49,764
Do not judge people on vibrations.

67
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:53,639
Judge yourself, all the time.

68
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:59,098
I had told that Shiva Puja means more explanation,

69
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:01,390
more understanding, more this thing;

70
00:04:01,681 --> 00:04:07,556
because in other pujas we do all these mantras, this, that,

71
00:04:09,223 --> 00:04:14,473
but in this puja is to know the knowledge,

72
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:17,764
it's God.

73
00:04:18,223 --> 00:04:22,223
And to know that you know God itself is so great.

74
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:28,056
Whatever it is - She may be Mahamaya,

75
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:31,723
She may be anything, but I know Her.

76
00:04:32,223 --> 00:04:33,848
It cannot be described in one book,

77
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:36,764
it cannot be described in hundred books.

78
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:40,182
It cannot be described in words,

79
00:04:40,514 --> 00:04:45,098
but to know that's God - after all, that's God,

80
00:04:45,598 --> 00:04:48,390
God Almighty.

81
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:53,472
And that gives you

82
00:04:53,764 --> 00:04:57,348
that beautiful surrender,

83
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:01,556
where you just feel absolutely secured

84
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:07,015
in that ocean of love.

85
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:10,473
I wish you all to achieve that state.

86
00:05:11,473 --> 00:05:14,931
May God bless you.
