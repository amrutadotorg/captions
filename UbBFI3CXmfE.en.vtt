00:00:02.278 --> 00:00:09.251
Many now, many of us are there and we
are increasing in number.

00:00:09.452 --> 00:00:14.488
And we are going to increase more
and more, no doubt about it.

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:18.474
You have to realize that you have become
something.

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:21.130
Not that an organization is developing,

00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:32.144
but every person inside this, has got
something,

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:38.334
something very great that has
a transformation power.

00:00:38.535 --> 00:00:42.694
And hence it is necessary for us to know

00:00:42.887 --> 00:00:46.170
that we have entered into the Kingdom
of God.

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:52.517
And the laws of Kingdom of God are very
different from what we know of.

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:56.745
They operate in a different way.

00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:00.584
Unless and until you really understand
the operation of these laws,

00:01:00.785 --> 00:01:03.098
you cannot grow properly, you have to grow.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:05.987
All of you have to grow. If you cannot
grow in Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:09.176
you will be wasted.

00:01:09.377 --> 00:01:12.949
So it is very important that we should try
to understand

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.662
the divine laws, how they operate.

00:01:15.863 --> 00:01:18.151
And whatever we have been doing so far

00:01:18.352 --> 00:01:22.955
has been responsible for our non-growth.

00:01:23.155 --> 00:01:25.881
So we have to give up so many things

00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:31.046
which have been detrimental to our
progress.

00:01:31.247 --> 00:01:35.179
A small thing like comfort and sharing.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.910
In Sahaja Yoga I have found people they
worry too much about comfort

00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:43.825
even after Realization. They want to find
their own comforts.

00:01:44.026 --> 00:01:46.674
They want to have their own individualities

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:50.275
and they want to show that they are
different.

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:56.020
They are not the same as others are.

00:01:56.221 --> 00:02:00.590
If comfort becomes more important
for some people

00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:04.108
you can never grow, never grow
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:07.618
On the contrary, you may become a medium
of all the negativity

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.453
and will torture Sahaja Yoga by your
lethargy.

00:02:12.654 --> 00:02:15.534
So try to understand that comfort

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:19.583
actually is something that matter gives
you.

00:02:19.765 --> 00:02:23.802
Comfort is the slavery of the matter.

00:02:24.003 --> 00:02:26.771
You have seen your Mother, She can
sleep anywhere,

00:02:26.978 --> 00:02:31.064
She can eat anything, She can live the way
you all live.

00:02:31.265 --> 00:02:37.830
I have no problems, I have no demands
and you can do the same.

00:02:38.031 --> 00:02:43.143
Because this matter is all the time trying
to overpower you,

00:02:43.344 --> 00:02:49.515
all the time trying to overpower you
through comfort giving.

00:02:49.716 --> 00:02:52.629
If you get used to sitting on a chair,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.404
then you have to carry chair along
with you.

00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:58.084
You cannot sit on the ground, a simple
example I am saying.

00:02:58.285 --> 00:03:01.159
It’s a certain thing that your body gets
used to.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.315
And then you want to maintain your own,
I must have

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:09.005
my own separate flat, or my own this thing,
because I must have comfort.

00:03:09.206 --> 00:03:11.630
This is one of the things that we have
to understand,

00:03:11.837 --> 00:03:14.270
that we have to learn without comfort,
so called.

00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:21.240
To Me comfort has no meaning at all.
It creeps on Me.

00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:26.561
Try to teach your body how to live
with uncomfortable things.

00:03:26.762 --> 00:03:30.098
Sometimes, sleep on the ground, see
how it works out.

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.880
Try to sit on the ground. Try to use
minimum of material things

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:39.590
because they have overpowered you
and you can’t live without them.

00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:42.088
I have known people who have to carry

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:46.646
folded chair at least to the seashore
because they can’t sit.

00:03:46.847 --> 00:03:49.613
They will get attached to a chair, I think,
after sometime,

00:03:49.814 --> 00:03:56.549
and like a tail the chair would be moving
with them. The way the things are, you see.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.098
So one thing we must understand, that
materialism acts through comfort.

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:08.765
That’s why we should try to keep these
dead things at our own command.

00:04:08.966 --> 00:04:13.064
If we want, we can have a chair, if we
don’t want, we will have no chair.

00:04:13.264 --> 00:04:15.862
They are not our masters, we are their
masters.

00:04:16.063 --> 00:04:18.840
We have made them.

00:04:20.454 --> 00:04:24.136
Then the second thing is about time.

00:04:24.337 --> 00:04:30.882
That maintenance of time that we should be
very punctual, we should be this and that.

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:35.040
And that we should abuse others for that.

00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:38.970
I mean, that doesn’t mean that you should
never be punctual. It doesn’t mean that.

00:04:39.171 --> 00:04:44.032
But what we do, we are slaves of the watch.
That should not be so.

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:46.657
We have to keep to certain timing

00:04:46.858 --> 00:04:49.334
because the whole world is moving
with that timing.

00:04:49.535 --> 00:04:54.965
But you should not scold anybody
for being late

00:04:55.166 --> 00:05:02.979
or for being not in time. Of course,
for puja it’s all right

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.672
because that’s divine work, for other
things.

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:09.735
And whenever it comes to that we should
think of others.

00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:13.462
You see, how to overcome time is to think
of others.

00:05:13.662 --> 00:05:19.644
For example, that we should be in time
in a place

00:05:19.845 --> 00:05:23.892
where others are not troubled by that.

00:05:24.093 --> 00:05:29.010
But we should not ask others, why are
you not in time.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.344
In everything, for example even in comfort,

00:05:32.545 --> 00:05:36.432
we should see to the comforts of others,
you will overcome your idea of comfort.

00:05:36.633 --> 00:05:39.974
Because it will be such a headache looking
after others’ comforts

00:05:40.175 --> 00:05:42.229
that you will overcome.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.462
In the same way you should try to share.

00:05:45.663 --> 00:05:47.791
People don’t know how to share their
things with others,

00:05:47.992 --> 00:05:51.768
share their house with others. They
always want to have their privacy.

00:05:51.957 --> 00:05:57.408
They want to have their own life. They
want to have their own style.

00:05:57.609 --> 00:06:04.548
It’s very, very wrong and these things can
act really against Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:07.973 --> 00:06:13.452
Sharing, sharing everything that you have.
Try to share.

00:06:13.653 --> 00:06:19.410
All such people who try to preserve
themselves are not going to grow.

00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:22.984
They have to get lost, completely lost.

00:06:23.185 --> 00:06:26.627
Because what you are preserving is nothing
but your ego,

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.631
your material being, your material things.

00:06:29.832 --> 00:06:32.538
It doesn’t mean that you break all your
things that you have,

00:06:32.739 --> 00:06:37.773
it does not mean that. But you preserve it
for others.

00:06:37.943 --> 00:06:42.172
You decorate your house for others
to enjoy.

00:06:42.373 --> 00:06:45.745
You create comfort for others and not
for yourself.

00:06:45.946 --> 00:06:52.168
This is how, if you work it out, you will
be amazed the joy will be maximum.

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:55.194
And you will really rise and you will grow.

00:06:55.399 --> 00:07:03.078
Now, when we think of others, the joy
is so much, so much greater,

00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:11.066
that it is surpassing all the other joys
of comfort and possession.

00:07:11.292 --> 00:07:14.425
Possession is a headache, absolute
headache.

00:07:14.626 --> 00:07:19.100
If you do not possess anything, you will
be not depriving yourself of anything.

00:07:19.301 --> 00:07:22.242
You will never feel a feeling that I am
deprived of this.

00:07:22.443 --> 00:07:26.978
Because you don’t possess anything. You
are the monarch of the whole world.

00:07:27.178 --> 00:07:32.106
Then how can anybody deprive anything
out of your anything?

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.295
So we must understand the laws that
govern us.

00:07:36.496 --> 00:07:44.215
Now after Realization, the more you try
to be comfortable,

00:07:44.952 --> 00:07:51.319
the more you try to be exclusive, you get
out of the grace of God.

00:07:52.313 --> 00:07:57.188
The more you try to have your own plans,
the worse it is.

00:07:57.389 --> 00:08:04.856
You have to act according to the plans of
God Almighty. And then you will be blessed.

00:08:05.057 --> 00:08:08.703
You will be blessed so much. But you will
not know

00:08:08.904 --> 00:08:13.456
how to use your blessings, it will be
so much.

00:08:13.657 --> 00:08:16.086
But do not have anything exclusive
to yourself.

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:21.961
Your comfort, your material things,
your time,

00:08:22.162 --> 00:08:27.037
whatever gives you feeling of your
“my, my” – just get over it.

00:08:27.238 --> 00:08:31.620
For example, even the subtlest of subtle
is “my mother”,

00:08:31.821 --> 00:08:41.106
“my father”, “my brother”, “my sister”,
“my children”, “my”.

00:08:41.526 --> 00:08:44.877
Who are the others?

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.003
Everything is your own.

00:08:51.204 --> 00:08:56.874
Then you will realize the joy
of collectivity.

00:08:57.075 --> 00:09:00.343
Now people talk of socialism, communism,
this, that,

00:09:00.544 --> 00:09:03.221
it’s all artificial. They can never enjoy
that sharing

00:09:03.422 --> 00:09:06.845
because it is forced.

00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:14.491
And these things can be of great joy
to you,

00:09:14.692 --> 00:09:20.114
if they are shared. The same things
can be headaches.

00:09:20.315 --> 00:09:24.096
I will give you a simple example.

00:09:24.591 --> 00:09:29.098
We had a lady from England, she married
an Indian.

00:09:29.299 --> 00:09:32.376
And the Indian people in that area were
very funny type,

00:09:32.577 --> 00:09:36.176
very narrow minded. They wouldn’t accept
her, and she was not given any love.

00:09:36.377 --> 00:09:42.597
She came back to London, no, she came
back to Bombay first to see Me,

00:09:42.798 --> 00:09:47.145
and naturally I was very nice to her and
I didn’t know what to give her.

00:09:47.346 --> 00:09:52.908
So I had a pearl necklace. Most
of the things are in the bank

00:09:53.109 --> 00:09:56.534
so I had only one pearl necklace left
with Me. So I said,

00:09:56.735 --> 00:10:01.602
“All right, you have this one just as
a symbol of My love” – gave it to her.

00:10:01.802 --> 00:10:05.138
Years passed, many years passed, you see,

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:12.740
and after about ten years or so, I met
her in London.

00:10:12.941 --> 00:10:17.117
And she told Me that she would like to come
and see Me.

00:10:17.318 --> 00:10:19.297
And she brought that necklace with her.

00:10:19.498 --> 00:10:22.188
She swears that, “This has sustained me
throughout,

00:10:22.358 --> 00:10:26.323
to believe that there is love.”

00:10:26.623 --> 00:10:30.465
This necklace, I would - I have so many
of them in My house.

00:10:30.665 --> 00:10:34.359
When I would, could have some more also.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.681
But this has given sustenance to someone
for years together

00:10:38.882 --> 00:10:41.415
to believe that there is somebody [who]
loves you.

00:10:41.616 --> 00:10:44.873
When that necklace is so precious to her,
to Me it was not so precious.

00:10:45.074 --> 00:10:48.217
It was a headache.

00:10:49.704 --> 00:10:58.606
The value of that is the subtle value
of that material thing.

00:10:58.807 --> 00:11:05.036
It is beyond aesthetics, it is love, which
is expressed through material thing.

00:11:05.237 --> 00:11:09.468
You know that whatever I touch vibrates.

00:11:10.407 --> 00:11:17.549
This love is only enjoyed if it is given.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.439
If I love My children only, if I love
My grandchildren only,

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.596
I would not be here.

00:11:26.575 --> 00:11:30.351
And gradually they also understand

00:11:30.552 --> 00:11:34.802
that this sharing is so important.

00:11:35.983 --> 00:11:45.211
So the laws of Divine are such that they
operate

00:11:45.412 --> 00:11:50.157
in a very blissful way on the people who
obey them,

00:11:50.358 --> 00:11:57.145
is one, as I said of sharing, one of giving
your comfort to others.

00:11:57.346 --> 00:11:59.473
You should be a comfortable person
to another,

00:11:59.674 --> 00:12:01.768
not an uncomfortable person.

00:12:01.969 --> 00:12:04.359
You should not be a difficult person
to others.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:10.715
Your tongue should be such that should
give great solace to others.

00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:19.407
Your eyes should be such that should give
a very great benediction to others.

00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:22.889
When you look at people, people should
feel that,

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:25.954
“Here is my security.”

00:12:26.155 --> 00:12:29.910
Not to enjoy others but give enjoy out
of you,

00:12:30.111 --> 00:12:32.804
enjoyment out of you, is the way you
should act.

00:12:33.005 --> 00:12:36.943
And then the laws of the Divine work
better.

00:12:37.144 --> 00:12:40.301
It is easy to criticize others. In Sahaja
Yoga also people do it.

00:12:40.502 --> 00:12:44.069
It’s a habit with people to criticize
others.

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:49.497
But if you can love others,

00:12:49.698 --> 00:12:52.898
then the criticism won’t be there. You
won’t see all these points.

00:12:53.099 --> 00:12:57.212
Now some people may take advantage
of your love, I know they do.

00:12:57.413 --> 00:13:02.293
But in Sahaja Yoga they go out. Such
people go out very fast.

00:13:02.494 --> 00:13:07.009
Those who try to take advantage of Sahaja
Yoga, they go out of it.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.090
So you don’t have to worry.

00:13:09.291 --> 00:13:12.642
There the divine laws will work it out
that such people will get out.

00:13:12.843 --> 00:13:16.012
But you try to love, you try to love.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:19.860
You bring down your ego. You try to love
others.

00:13:20.061 --> 00:13:23.815
And try to be one with God and His
blessings.

00:13:24.016 --> 00:13:28.676
As He loves you, you have to love the whole
world.

00:13:28.877 --> 00:13:31.629
And those who try to trouble you

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.418
will be punished, I tell you, they will be
punished.

00:13:35.619 --> 00:13:40.087
But you have to be one with the Divine
laws.

00:13:40.288 --> 00:13:45.839
And this once you realize, your own
problems will neutralize completely.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.742
Like your family problem, house problem,

00:13:48.943 --> 00:13:53.393
property problem, this problem, they will
all neutralize.

00:13:53.594 --> 00:13:58.494
Only sometimes, I find a conflict between
family people.

00:13:58.695 --> 00:14:02.250
Your priority should be Sahaja Yoga,
Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:02.451 --> 00:14:06.829
Say, a husband may not be equally
interested in Sahaja Yoga

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:09.765
and the wife is pulled out. She should show

00:14:09.966 --> 00:14:14.078
that her interest is Sahaja Yoga, nothing
else, and he will come round.

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:18.945
She should not give way – she should not
give way to him.

00:14:19.146 --> 00:14:23.563
And if he is so that he wants to get
into Sahaja Yoga

00:14:23.764 --> 00:14:28.025
and if she objects. She has no business
to do that,

00:14:28.226 --> 00:14:30.468
under any Divine law she has no business
to do that.

00:14:30.668 --> 00:14:33.830
If she tries that, husband need not listen
to her at all,

00:14:34.031 --> 00:14:37.417
he should go full ahead. Because
ultimately,

00:14:37.618 --> 00:14:42.439
he is an important part of Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:43.153 --> 00:14:49.112
And he should not in any way make
the importance less.

00:14:49.313 --> 00:14:51.217
So she should go ahead with what she wants.

00:14:51.399 --> 00:14:55.074
If he is a sahaja yogi, he should not
bother about anything.

00:14:55.275 --> 00:14:57.838
His family will be blessed, everybody
will be blessed,

00:14:58.039 --> 00:15:01.030
if he is there.

00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:05.630
So any excuses that takes you away
from Sahaja Yoga

00:15:05.831 --> 00:15:08.450
are not helpful to the family. Because
if the deities are angry,

00:15:08.651 --> 00:15:11.247
your family will be harmed.

00:15:11.448 --> 00:15:17.534
If say, a woman is a sahaja-yogini and
her family people object to it,

00:15:17.734 --> 00:15:19.865
they will be harmed and she will be
harmed as well.

00:15:20.066 --> 00:15:25.112
But if she is in Sahaja Yoga all the family
will be saved.

00:15:26.027 --> 00:15:31.244
So, you are doing a greater, you are doing
a greater –

00:15:31.445 --> 00:15:35.212
what you call – a greater service to your
family

00:15:35.413 --> 00:15:38.387
by becoming a sahaja yogi and a true
sahaja yogi

00:15:38.588 --> 00:15:42.765
and a dedicated and devoted sahaja yogi.

00:15:44.178 --> 00:15:49.469
But no individualistic efforts, no
individualistic attitude

00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.652
is helpful to Me or to Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:53.853 --> 00:15:57.939
is very detrimental under any name,

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:02.772
under any banner, under any excuse.

00:16:03.324 --> 00:16:07.600
Try to find out ways and methods
of becoming one with others.

00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:10.433
If you want to find out faults with others,
there can be any,

00:16:10.634 --> 00:16:13.255
I mean, I should not be here.

00:16:13.456 --> 00:16:18.349
I can say that. But I should not be
on this earth.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.608
I could have said that.

00:16:21.809 --> 00:16:27.594
But I see that Spirit in you, and I see
that beauty in you.

00:16:27.795 --> 00:16:29.870
I don’t see other things.

00:16:30.071 --> 00:16:34.660
If I had not seen that Spirit, I would not
have worked like this.

00:16:34.861 --> 00:16:36.993
So, all such people who try to take

00:16:37.194 --> 00:16:43.361
any on their own thing will land up
into difficulties.

00:16:43.562 --> 00:16:48.796
It’s malignancy of Sahaja Yoga,
is the cancer.

00:16:49.457 --> 00:16:52.755
People are so much used to, you see,
certain ways of doing things,

00:16:52.956 --> 00:16:55.796
like you see we Indians are, we must take
a bath every day.

00:16:55.997 --> 00:16:59.992
It’s true with us. I mean, one example
I am giving.

00:17:00.193 --> 00:17:05.615
Like English are very particular about
say, maybe,

00:17:06.427 --> 00:17:10.650
say, using a napkin at the time of food.
Take a small thing like that.

00:17:10.851 --> 00:17:15.476
I mean, they are very, that’s for them
is religion.

00:17:15.677 --> 00:17:17.685
Same way Indians are.

00:17:17.886 --> 00:17:23.764
Now, I didn’t take My bath yesterday
because there were so many people.

00:17:25.566 --> 00:17:31.668
I shouldn’t take. If I use all the water
what will happen?

00:17:32.671 --> 00:17:35.126
And any time I am with you people I don’t
take bath

00:17:35.327 --> 00:17:37.573
till I have to have a puja.

00:17:37.774 --> 00:17:40.988
I mean it’s difficult for Indians to do
that.

00:17:41.189 --> 00:17:43.157
But you can get over your habits when
you say

00:17:43.358 --> 00:17:47.175
you are sharing that with others.

00:17:49.743 --> 00:17:54.553
But those who are inconsiderate will not
understand this.

00:17:54.754 --> 00:17:58.347
It is not necessary to come to puja also
so much cleaned up

00:17:58.548 --> 00:18:03.738
by sharing everybody’s things yourself,
by having everything yourself.

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:06.436
It’s more important that you should come
here with a heart

00:18:06.637 --> 00:18:10.054
which has shared the joy with everyone.

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:12.881
Even if you have not cleaned yourself,
doesn’t matter.

00:18:13.082 --> 00:18:16.584
You are all right for God.

00:18:18.043 --> 00:18:23.507
But sharing is very important and that is
what I find is lacking.

00:18:23.708 --> 00:18:30.084
People will take interest in their own
children, not interest in other children.

00:18:30.285 --> 00:18:32.435
They will take interest in their own
family, their homes,

00:18:32.641 --> 00:18:35.828
houses, but not in another person’s houses.

00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:40.685
Try to share your labour with others also.

00:18:42.002 --> 00:18:49.358
And you will be surprised how rewarding
it is, how rewarding.

00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:52.254
And little children don’t understand
the difference sometimes,

00:18:52.455 --> 00:18:56.468
they don’t understand who is the other.
Like we went to Delhi once,

00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:58.953
and we shifted and I cleaned the house.

00:18:59.154 --> 00:19:03.857
It was very dirty and all that, cleaned it
and decorated it and all that.

00:19:04.058 --> 00:19:06.262
So My daughter said that, “Why don’t You
go and decorate

00:19:06.463 --> 00:19:12.074
the other houses also, and clean them?
They are very dirty houses”.

00:19:12.275 --> 00:19:15.127
They didn’t understand that it is too much
for their Mother.

00:19:15.328 --> 00:19:16.778
“See, You better do it, they can’t do it
all right,

00:19:16.979 --> 00:19:21.942
so better do it”. It’s that simple
for them.

00:19:22.275 --> 00:19:27.965
And this materialistic attitude, you know
what is happening to us with that.

00:19:28.166 --> 00:19:31.323
I mean, thank God you are not like
the Indians who have come here.

00:19:31.524 --> 00:19:33.931
They are very materialistic. You have got
out of it.

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:37.708
But still, in a very subtle way it sticks
on through your comfort,

00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:40.798
through your idea of taking a holiday

00:19:40.999 --> 00:19:44.888
and going out for a holiday alone, you see,
with your family.

00:19:45.089 --> 00:19:48.615
This is your family. Your family is large.

00:19:48.816 --> 00:19:51.925
Your Mother has so many children, what
to do?

00:19:52.205 --> 00:19:57.351
She has so many sons and daughters.
Everything is to be shared.

00:19:57.552 --> 00:19:59.420
You will never enjoy your holiday alone.

00:19:59.621 --> 00:20:03.877
You can only enjoy with Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:04.217 --> 00:20:06.473
This is what it is.

00:20:06.674 --> 00:20:12.735
Once you start enjoying that, you’ll be
amazed how beautiful it is.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.392
This is what I want to tell you today
in Cambridge,

00:20:16.567 --> 00:20:20.359
because from Cambridge people have gone
all over the world.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.336
They were educated here. They went round
the whole world.

00:20:24.537 --> 00:20:30.067
They are everywhere. It has circulated
so much and -

00:20:30.268 --> 00:20:34.130
but Cambridge people are very snooty,
as they say.

00:20:34.331 --> 00:20:36.835
They don’t want to share with anyone.
Just imagine!

00:20:37.036 --> 00:20:41.183
Cambridge is a place which is meant
for sharing.

00:20:41.384 --> 00:20:44.004
That’s the place where they don’t want
to share.

00:20:44.205 --> 00:20:47.398
Knowledge is one thing is to be only
enjoyed after sharing.

00:20:47.599 --> 00:20:51.886
Otherwise you cannot enjoy your knowledge.

00:20:54.135 --> 00:20:59.344
So share your joys and share your
happiness.

00:20:59.545 --> 00:21:02.734
And you will be amazed [that] all your
pathos, and all your unhappiness

00:21:02.935 --> 00:21:06.961
will vanish, completely vanish.

00:21:07.162 --> 00:21:13.542
These are all the old things of the past
life, forget it.

00:21:13.743 --> 00:21:16.931
You have to all forget that you belong
to this community

00:21:17.132 --> 00:21:20.222
or that community. Just learn to share.

00:21:20.423 --> 00:21:25.444
The highest thing, the highest material
thing that is created in this world,

00:21:25.645 --> 00:21:30.659
even above flowers and everything,
are human beings.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.190
Just share them, just enjoy them.

00:21:33.391 --> 00:21:37.736
They are the best thing God has produced.

00:21:38.197 --> 00:21:40.341
Just enjoy them.

00:21:40.542 --> 00:21:51.032
This is what is necessary if you really
want to obey the laws of God.

00:21:51.233 --> 00:21:59.304
Today, I hope with this puja, your heart
will enlarge, you see.

00:21:59.505 --> 00:22:05.573
And that you will learn to share with
that big heart.

00:22:05.774 --> 00:22:09.266
Just try to share your things.

00:22:09.467 --> 00:22:14.595
Share your time. Share your comforts.

00:22:14.796 --> 00:22:18.802
Share every moment of your life with
others.

00:22:19.003 --> 00:22:21.836
Think of good things of other people,
you’ll enjoy them.

00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:25.465
If you start thinking of the thorns instead
of the roses,

00:22:25.666 --> 00:22:28.774
will you enjoy roses? If you have to enjoy
the roses,

00:22:28.975 --> 00:22:30.764
you have to forget the thorns and enjoy
the roses.

00:22:30.965 --> 00:22:34.775
Those who are wise are like that. But
stupid can take the thorns

00:22:34.976 --> 00:22:40.923
and just go on pricking themselves and
saying that “Oh! There are thorns.”

00:22:41.153 --> 00:22:44.439
The sign of wisdom is to enjoy the beauty
of roses,

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.104
they are the most beautiful things.

00:22:47.305 --> 00:22:52.542
They are all roses, I see you all roses
here, and I forget the thorns.

00:22:52.743 --> 00:22:56.035
And the day will come they will not need
even the thorns,

00:22:56.236 --> 00:23:00.002
because they will be so powerful.

00:23:00.816 --> 00:23:03.073
And there should be no groupism
of any kind,

00:23:03.274 --> 00:23:05.440
of intellectuals coming together,

00:23:05.641 --> 00:23:08.737
non-intellectuals coming together,
alcoholics on one side.

00:23:08.938 --> 00:23:14.204
In Sahaja Yoga also we have caste system,
just imagine.

00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:18.910
Then some Indians are separate, then
English are separate.

00:23:19.111 --> 00:23:25.466
Then Cambridge people are separate.
There should be no separation.

00:23:26.335 --> 00:23:31.298
We are all one. We are all born through
our Sahasrara.

00:23:31.499 --> 00:23:34.146
We are a different community and
a different thing.

00:23:34.347 --> 00:23:37.411
We cannot form into groups, cannot form
into cults,

00:23:37.612 --> 00:23:42.726
and cannot form into any caste.

00:23:42.927 --> 00:23:46.244
We are all twice born people.

00:23:46.445 --> 00:23:50.024
We are the people who are born again.
We are different.

00:23:50.225 --> 00:23:53.880
We have lost all that. Everything is lost,
you see.

00:23:54.081 --> 00:23:57.646
They say there is no caste for a sanyasi,
for an ascetic,

00:23:57.847 --> 00:24:00.710
means the one who is a realized soul,
there is no caste.

00:24:00.911 --> 00:24:04.014
You don’t belong to any caste. Forget
your problems of your country,

00:24:04.215 --> 00:24:10.675
of your nation, of your, so called your
people. Forget it, you are different.

00:24:10.876 --> 00:24:15.187
And try to pull them up to that where
they also become one with Whole.

00:24:15.388 --> 00:24:18.538
The whole world has to unite like this.

00:24:18.739 --> 00:24:23.416
Give up your small, small differences
and angularities.

00:24:23.617 --> 00:24:26.769
My God Bless you all.
