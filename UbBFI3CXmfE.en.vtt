WEBVTT

00:02.278 --> 00:09.251
Many now, many of us are there and we
are increasing in number.

00:09.452 --> 00:14.488
And we are going to increase more
and more, no doubt about it.

00:14.689 --> 00:18.474
You have to realize that you have become
something.

00:18.675 --> 00:21.130
Not that an organization is developing,

00:21.331 --> 00:32.144
but every person inside this, has got
something,

00:32.345 --> 00:38.334
something very great that has
a transformation power.

00:38.535 --> 00:42.694
And hence it is necessary for us to know

00:42.887 --> 00:46.170
that we have entered into the Kingdom
of God.

00:46.371 --> 00:52.517
And the laws of Kingdom of God are very
different from what we know of.

00:52.718 --> 00:56.745
They operate in a different way.

00:57.006 --> 01:00.584
Unless and until you really understand
the operation of these laws,

01:00.785 --> 01:03.098
you cannot grow properly, you have to grow.

01:03.299 --> 01:05.987
All of you have to grow. If you cannot
grow in Sahaja Yoga,

01:06.188 --> 01:09.176
you will be wasted.

01:09.377 --> 01:12.949
So it is very important that we should try
to understand

01:13.150 --> 01:15.662
the divine laws, how they operate.

01:15.863 --> 01:18.151
And whatever we have been doing so far

01:18.352 --> 01:22.955
has been responsible for our non-growth.

01:23.155 --> 01:25.881
So we have to give up so many things

01:26.082 --> 01:31.046
which have been detrimental to our
progress.

01:31.247 --> 01:35.179
A small thing like comfort and sharing.

01:35.380 --> 01:38.910
In Sahaja Yoga I have found people they
worry too much about comfort

01:39.111 --> 01:43.825
even after Realization. They want to find
their own comforts.

01:44.026 --> 01:46.674
They want to have their own individualities

01:46.875 --> 01:50.275
and they want to show that they are
different.

01:50.476 --> 01:56.020
They are not the same as others are.

01:56.221 --> 02:00.590
If comfort becomes more important
for some people

02:00.791 --> 02:04.108
you can never grow, never grow
in Sahaja Yoga.

02:04.309 --> 02:07.618
On the contrary, you may become a medium
of all the negativity

02:07.819 --> 02:12.453
and will torture Sahaja Yoga by your
lethargy.

02:12.654 --> 02:15.534
So try to understand that comfort

02:15.735 --> 02:19.583
actually is something that matter gives
you.

02:19.765 --> 02:23.802
Comfort is the slavery of the matter.

02:24.003 --> 02:26.771
You have seen your Mother, She can
sleep anywhere,

02:26.978 --> 02:31.064
She can eat anything, She can live the way
you all live.

02:31.265 --> 02:37.830
I have no problems, I have no demands
and you can do the same.

02:38.031 --> 02:43.143
Because this matter is all the time trying
to overpower you,

02:43.344 --> 02:49.515
all the time trying to overpower you
through comfort giving.

02:49.716 --> 02:52.629
If you get used to sitting on a chair,

02:52.830 --> 02:54.404
then you have to carry chair along
with you.

02:54.605 --> 02:58.084
You cannot sit on the ground, a simple
example I am saying.

02:58.285 --> 03:01.159
It’s a certain thing that your body gets
used to.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.315
And then you want to maintain your own,
I must have

03:03.516 --> 03:09.005
my own separate flat, or my own this thing,
because I must have comfort.

03:09.206 --> 03:11.630
This is one of the things that we have
to understand,

03:11.837 --> 03:14.270
that we have to learn without comfort,
so called.

03:14.471 --> 03:21.240
To Me comfort has no meaning at all.
It creeps on Me.

03:21.851 --> 03:26.561
Try to teach your body how to live
with uncomfortable things.

03:26.762 --> 03:30.098
Sometimes, sleep on the ground, see
how it works out.

03:30.299 --> 03:34.880
Try to sit on the ground. Try to use
minimum of material things

03:35.081 --> 03:39.590
because they have overpowered you
and you can’t live without them.

03:39.791 --> 03:42.088
I have known people who have to carry

03:42.289 --> 03:46.646
folded chair at least to the seashore
because they can’t sit.

03:46.847 --> 03:49.613
They will get attached to a chair, I think,
after sometime,

03:49.814 --> 03:56.549
and like a tail the chair would be moving
with them. The way the things are, you see.

03:56.750 --> 04:02.098
So one thing we must understand, that
materialism acts through comfort.

04:02.299 --> 04:08.765
That’s why we should try to keep these
dead things at our own command.

04:08.966 --> 04:13.064
If we want, we can have a chair, if we
don’t want, we will have no chair.

04:13.264 --> 04:15.862
They are not our masters, we are their
masters.

04:16.063 --> 04:18.840
We have made them.

04:20.454 --> 04:24.136
Then the second thing is about time.

04:24.337 --> 04:30.882
That maintenance of time that we should be
very punctual, we should be this and that.

04:31.083 --> 04:35.040
And that we should abuse others for that.

04:35.241 --> 04:38.970
I mean, that doesn’t mean that you should
never be punctual. It doesn’t mean that.

04:39.171 --> 04:44.032
But what we do, we are slaves of the watch.
That should not be so.

04:44.233 --> 04:46.657
We have to keep to certain timing

04:46.858 --> 04:49.334
because the whole world is moving
with that timing.

04:49.535 --> 04:54.965
But you should not scold anybody
for being late

04:55.166 --> 05:02.979
or for being not in time. Of course,
for puja it’s all right

05:03.180 --> 05:06.672
because that’s divine work, for other
things.

05:06.873 --> 05:09.735
And whenever it comes to that we should
think of others.

05:09.935 --> 05:13.462
You see, how to overcome time is to think
of others.

05:13.662 --> 05:19.644
For example, that we should be in time
in a place

05:19.845 --> 05:23.892
where others are not troubled by that.

05:24.093 --> 05:29.010
But we should not ask others, why are
you not in time.

05:29.710 --> 05:32.344
In everything, for example even in comfort,

05:32.545 --> 05:36.432
we should see to the comforts of others,
you will overcome your idea of comfort.

05:36.633 --> 05:39.974
Because it will be such a headache looking
after others’ comforts

05:40.175 --> 05:42.229
that you will overcome.

05:42.430 --> 05:45.462
In the same way you should try to share.

05:45.663 --> 05:47.791
People don’t know how to share their
things with others,

05:47.992 --> 05:51.768
share their house with others. They
always want to have their privacy.

05:51.957 --> 05:57.408
They want to have their own life. They
want to have their own style.

05:57.609 --> 06:04.548
It’s very, very wrong and these things can
act really against Sahaja Yoga.

06:07.973 --> 06:13.452
Sharing, sharing everything that you have.
Try to share.

06:13.653 --> 06:19.410
All such people who try to preserve
themselves are not going to grow.

06:19.611 --> 06:22.984
They have to get lost, completely lost.

06:23.185 --> 06:26.627
Because what you are preserving is nothing
but your ego,

06:26.789 --> 06:29.631
your material being, your material things.

06:29.832 --> 06:32.538
It doesn’t mean that you break all your
things that you have,

06:32.739 --> 06:37.773
it does not mean that. But you preserve it
for others.

06:37.943 --> 06:42.172
You decorate your house for others
to enjoy.

06:42.373 --> 06:45.745
You create comfort for others and not
for yourself.

06:45.946 --> 06:52.168
This is how, if you work it out, you will
be amazed the joy will be maximum.

06:52.369 --> 06:55.194
And you will really rise and you will grow.

06:55.399 --> 07:03.078
Now, when we think of others, the joy
is so much, so much greater,

07:03.981 --> 07:11.066
that it is surpassing all the other joys
of comfort and possession.

07:11.292 --> 07:14.425
Possession is a headache, absolute
headache.

07:14.626 --> 07:19.100
If you do not possess anything, you will
be not depriving yourself of anything.

07:19.301 --> 07:22.242
You will never feel a feeling that I am
deprived of this.

07:22.443 --> 07:26.978
Because you don’t possess anything. You
are the monarch of the whole world.

07:27.178 --> 07:32.106
Then how can anybody deprive anything
out of your anything?

07:32.720 --> 07:36.295
So we must understand the laws that
govern us.

07:36.496 --> 07:44.215
Now after Realization, the more you try
to be comfortable,

07:44.952 --> 07:51.319
the more you try to be exclusive, you get
out of the grace of God.

07:52.313 --> 07:57.188
The more you try to have your own plans,
the worse it is.

07:57.389 --> 08:04.856
You have to act according to the plans of
God Almighty. And then you will be blessed.

08:05.057 --> 08:08.703
You will be blessed so much. But you will
not know

08:08.904 --> 08:13.456
how to use your blessings, it will be
so much.

08:13.657 --> 08:16.086
But do not have anything exclusive
to yourself.

08:16.287 --> 08:21.961
Your comfort, your material things,
your time,

08:22.162 --> 08:27.037
whatever gives you feeling of your
“my, my” – just get over it.

08:27.238 --> 08:31.620
For example, even the subtlest of subtle
is “my mother”,

08:31.821 --> 08:41.106
“my father”, “my brother”, “my sister”,
“my children”, “my”.

08:41.526 --> 08:44.877
Who are the others?

08:47.320 --> 08:51.003
Everything is your own.

08:51.204 --> 08:56.874
Then you will realize the joy
of collectivity.

08:57.075 --> 09:00.343
Now people talk of socialism, communism,
this, that,

09:00.544 --> 09:03.221
it’s all artificial. They can never enjoy
that sharing

09:03.422 --> 09:06.845
because it is forced.

09:10.081 --> 09:14.491
And these things can be of great joy
to you,

09:14.692 --> 09:20.114
if they are shared. The same things
can be headaches.

09:20.315 --> 09:24.096
I will give you a simple example.

09:24.591 --> 09:29.098
We had a lady from England, she married
an Indian.

09:29.299 --> 09:32.376
And the Indian people in that area were
very funny type,

09:32.577 --> 09:36.176
very narrow minded. They wouldn’t accept
her, and she was not given any love.

09:36.377 --> 09:42.597
She came back to London, no, she came
back to Bombay first to see Me,

09:42.798 --> 09:47.145
and naturally I was very nice to her and
I didn’t know what to give her.

09:47.346 --> 09:52.908
So I had a pearl necklace. Most
of the things are in the bank

09:53.109 --> 09:56.534
so I had only one pearl necklace left
with Me. So I said,

09:56.735 --> 10:01.602
“All right, you have this one just as
a symbol of My love” – gave it to her.

10:01.802 --> 10:05.138
Years passed, many years passed, you see,

10:05.339 --> 10:12.740
and after about ten years or so, I met
her in London.

10:12.941 --> 10:17.117
And she told Me that she would like to come
and see Me.

10:17.318 --> 10:19.297
And she brought that necklace with her.

10:19.498 --> 10:22.188
She swears that, “This has sustained me
throughout,

10:22.358 --> 10:26.323
to believe that there is love.”

10:26.623 --> 10:30.465
This necklace, I would - I have so many
of them in My house.

10:30.665 --> 10:34.359
When I would, could have some more also.

10:34.560 --> 10:38.681
But this has given sustenance to someone
for years together

10:38.882 --> 10:41.415
to believe that there is somebody [who]
loves you.

10:41.616 --> 10:44.873
When that necklace is so precious to her,
to Me it was not so precious.

10:45.074 --> 10:48.217
It was a headache.

10:49.704 --> 10:58.606
The value of that is the subtle value
of that material thing.

10:58.807 --> 11:05.036
It is beyond aesthetics, it is love, which
is expressed through material thing.

11:05.237 --> 11:09.468
You know that whatever I touch vibrates.

11:10.407 --> 11:17.549
This love is only enjoyed if it is given.

11:17.750 --> 11:21.439
If I love My children only, if I love
My grandchildren only,

11:21.640 --> 11:24.596
I would not be here.

11:26.575 --> 11:30.351
And gradually they also understand

11:30.552 --> 11:34.802
that this sharing is so important.

11:35.983 --> 11:45.211
So the laws of Divine are such that they
operate

11:45.412 --> 11:50.157
in a very blissful way on the people who
obey them,

11:50.358 --> 11:57.145
is one, as I said of sharing, one of giving
your comfort to others.

11:57.346 --> 11:59.473
You should be a comfortable person
to another,

11:59.674 --> 12:01.768
not an uncomfortable person.

12:01.969 --> 12:04.359
You should not be a difficult person
to others.

12:04.560 --> 12:10.715
Your tongue should be such that should
give great solace to others.

12:10.916 --> 12:19.407
Your eyes should be such that should give
a very great benediction to others.

12:19.608 --> 12:22.889
When you look at people, people should
feel that,

12:23.090 --> 12:25.954
“Here is my security.”

12:26.155 --> 12:29.910
Not to enjoy others but give enjoy out
of you,

12:30.111 --> 12:32.804
enjoyment out of you, is the way you
should act.

12:33.005 --> 12:36.943
And then the laws of the Divine work
better.

12:37.144 --> 12:40.301
It is easy to criticize others. In Sahaja
Yoga also people do it.

12:40.502 --> 12:44.069
It’s a habit with people to criticize
others.

12:44.270 --> 12:49.497
But if you can love others,

12:49.698 --> 12:52.898
then the criticism won’t be there. You
won’t see all these points.

12:53.099 --> 12:57.212
Now some people may take advantage
of your love, I know they do.

12:57.413 --> 13:02.293
But in Sahaja Yoga they go out. Such
people go out very fast.

13:02.494 --> 13:07.009
Those who try to take advantage of Sahaja
Yoga, they go out of it.

13:07.210 --> 13:09.090
So you don’t have to worry.

13:09.291 --> 13:12.642
There the divine laws will work it out
that such people will get out.

13:12.843 --> 13:16.012
But you try to love, you try to love.

13:16.212 --> 13:19.860
You bring down your ego. You try to love
others.

13:20.061 --> 13:23.815
And try to be one with God and His
blessings.

13:24.016 --> 13:28.676
As He loves you, you have to love the whole
world.

13:28.877 --> 13:31.629
And those who try to trouble you

13:31.830 --> 13:35.418
will be punished, I tell you, they will be
punished.

13:35.619 --> 13:40.087
But you have to be one with the Divine
laws.

13:40.288 --> 13:45.839
And this once you realize, your own
problems will neutralize completely.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.742
Like your family problem, house problem,

13:48.943 --> 13:53.393
property problem, this problem, they will
all neutralize.

13:53.594 --> 13:58.494
Only sometimes, I find a conflict between
family people.

13:58.695 --> 14:02.250
Your priority should be Sahaja Yoga,
Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja Yoga.

14:02.451 --> 14:06.829
Say, a husband may not be equally
interested in Sahaja Yoga

14:07.030 --> 14:09.765
and the wife is pulled out. She should show

14:09.966 --> 14:14.078
that her interest is Sahaja Yoga, nothing
else, and he will come round.

14:14.279 --> 14:18.945
She should not give way – she should not
give way to him.

14:19.146 --> 14:23.563
And if he is so that he wants to get
into Sahaja Yoga

14:23.764 --> 14:28.025
and if she objects. She has no business
to do that,

14:28.226 --> 14:30.468
under any Divine law she has no business
to do that.

14:30.668 --> 14:33.830
If she tries that, husband need not listen
to her at all,

14:34.031 --> 14:37.417
he should go full ahead. Because
ultimately,

14:37.618 --> 14:42.439
he is an important part of Sahaja Yoga.

14:43.153 --> 14:49.112
And he should not in any way make
the importance less.

14:49.313 --> 14:51.217
So she should go ahead with what she wants.

14:51.399 --> 14:55.074
If he is a sahaja yogi, he should not
bother about anything.

14:55.275 --> 14:57.838
His family will be blessed, everybody
will be blessed,

14:58.039 --> 15:01.030
if he is there.

15:01.509 --> 15:05.630
So any excuses that takes you away
from Sahaja Yoga

15:05.831 --> 15:08.450
are not helpful to the family. Because
if the deities are angry,

15:08.651 --> 15:11.247
your family will be harmed.

15:11.448 --> 15:17.534
If say, a woman is a sahaja-yogini and
her family people object to it,

15:17.734 --> 15:19.865
they will be harmed and she will be
harmed as well.

15:20.066 --> 15:25.112
But if she is in Sahaja Yoga all the family
will be saved.

15:26.027 --> 15:31.244
So, you are doing a greater, you are doing
a greater –

15:31.445 --> 15:35.212
what you call – a greater service to your
family

15:35.413 --> 15:38.387
by becoming a sahaja yogi and a true
sahaja yogi

15:38.588 --> 15:42.765
and a dedicated and devoted sahaja yogi.

15:44.178 --> 15:49.469
But no individualistic efforts, no
individualistic attitude

15:49.670 --> 15:53.652
is helpful to Me or to Sahaja Yoga,

15:53.853 --> 15:57.939
is very detrimental under any name,

15:58.140 --> 16:02.772
under any banner, under any excuse.

16:03.324 --> 16:07.600
Try to find out ways and methods
of becoming one with others.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.433
If you want to find out faults with others,
there can be any,

16:10.634 --> 16:13.255
I mean, I should not be here.

16:13.456 --> 16:18.349
I can say that. But I should not be
on this earth.

16:18.550 --> 16:21.608
I could have said that.

16:21.809 --> 16:27.594
But I see that Spirit in you, and I see
that beauty in you.

16:27.795 --> 16:29.870
I don’t see other things.

16:30.071 --> 16:34.660
If I had not seen that Spirit, I would not
have worked like this.

16:34.861 --> 16:36.993
So, all such people who try to take

16:37.194 --> 16:43.361
any on their own thing will land up
into difficulties.

16:43.562 --> 16:48.796
It’s malignancy of Sahaja Yoga,
is the cancer.

16:49.457 --> 16:52.755
People are so much used to, you see,
certain ways of doing things,

16:52.956 --> 16:55.796
like you see we Indians are, we must take
a bath every day.

16:55.997 --> 16:59.992
It’s true with us. I mean, one example
I am giving.

17:00.193 --> 17:05.615
Like English are very particular about
say, maybe,

17:06.427 --> 17:10.650
say, using a napkin at the time of food.
Take a small thing like that.

17:10.851 --> 17:15.476
I mean, they are very, that’s for them
is religion.

17:15.677 --> 17:17.685
Same way Indians are.

17:17.886 --> 17:23.764
Now, I didn’t take My bath yesterday
because there were so many people.

17:25.566 --> 17:31.668
I shouldn’t take. If I use all the water
what will happen?

17:32.671 --> 17:35.126
And any time I am with you people I don’t
take bath

17:35.327 --> 17:37.573
till I have to have a puja.

17:37.774 --> 17:40.988
I mean it’s difficult for Indians to do
that.

17:41.189 --> 17:43.157
But you can get over your habits when
you say

17:43.358 --> 17:47.175
you are sharing that with others.

17:49.743 --> 17:54.553
But those who are inconsiderate will not
understand this.

17:54.754 --> 17:58.347
It is not necessary to come to puja also
so much cleaned up

17:58.548 --> 18:03.738
by sharing everybody’s things yourself,
by having everything yourself.

18:03.910 --> 18:06.436
It’s more important that you should come
here with a heart

18:06.637 --> 18:10.054
which has shared the joy with everyone.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.881
Even if you have not cleaned yourself,
doesn’t matter.

18:13.082 --> 18:16.584
You are all right for God.

18:18.043 --> 18:23.507
But sharing is very important and that is
what I find is lacking.

18:23.708 --> 18:30.084
People will take interest in their own
children, not interest in other children.

18:30.285 --> 18:32.435
They will take interest in their own
family, their homes,

18:32.641 --> 18:35.828
houses, but not in another person’s houses.

18:36.029 --> 18:40.685
Try to share your labour with others also.

18:42.002 --> 18:49.358
And you will be surprised how rewarding
it is, how rewarding.

18:49.559 --> 18:52.254
And little children don’t understand
the difference sometimes,

18:52.455 --> 18:56.468
they don’t understand who is the other.
Like we went to Delhi once,

18:56.669 --> 18:58.953
and we shifted and I cleaned the house.

18:59.154 --> 19:03.857
It was very dirty and all that, cleaned it
and decorated it and all that.

19:04.058 --> 19:06.262
So My daughter said that, “Why don’t You
go and decorate

19:06.463 --> 19:12.074
the other houses also, and clean them?
They are very dirty houses”.

19:12.275 --> 19:15.127
They didn’t understand that it is too much
for their Mother.

19:15.328 --> 19:16.778
“See, You better do it, they can’t do it
all right,

19:16.979 --> 19:21.942
so better do it”. It’s that simple
for them.

19:22.275 --> 19:27.965
And this materialistic attitude, you know
what is happening to us with that.

19:28.166 --> 19:31.323
I mean, thank God you are not like
the Indians who have come here.

19:31.524 --> 19:33.931
They are very materialistic. You have got
out of it.

19:34.132 --> 19:37.708
But still, in a very subtle way it sticks
on through your comfort,

19:37.909 --> 19:40.798
through your idea of taking a holiday

19:40.999 --> 19:44.888
and going out for a holiday alone, you see,
with your family.

19:45.089 --> 19:48.615
This is your family. Your family is large.

19:48.816 --> 19:51.925
Your Mother has so many children, what
to do?

19:52.205 --> 19:57.351
She has so many sons and daughters.
Everything is to be shared.

19:57.552 --> 19:59.420
You will never enjoy your holiday alone.

19:59.621 --> 20:03.877
You can only enjoy with Sahaja Yogis.

20:04.217 --> 20:06.473
This is what it is.

20:06.674 --> 20:12.735
Once you start enjoying that, you’ll be
amazed how beautiful it is.

20:13.560 --> 20:16.392
This is what I want to tell you today
in Cambridge,

20:16.567 --> 20:20.359
because from Cambridge people have gone
all over the world.

20:20.560 --> 20:24.336
They were educated here. They went round
the whole world.

20:24.537 --> 20:30.067
They are everywhere. It has circulated
so much and -

20:30.268 --> 20:34.130
but Cambridge people are very snooty,
as they say.

20:34.331 --> 20:36.835
They don’t want to share with anyone.
Just imagine!

20:37.036 --> 20:41.183
Cambridge is a place which is meant
for sharing.

20:41.384 --> 20:44.004
That’s the place where they don’t want
to share.

20:44.205 --> 20:47.398
Knowledge is one thing is to be only
enjoyed after sharing.

20:47.599 --> 20:51.886
Otherwise you cannot enjoy your knowledge.

20:54.135 --> 20:59.344
So share your joys and share your
happiness.

20:59.545 --> 21:02.734
And you will be amazed [that] all your
pathos, and all your unhappiness

21:02.935 --> 21:06.961
will vanish, completely vanish.

21:07.162 --> 21:13.542
These are all the old things of the past
life, forget it.

21:13.743 --> 21:16.931
You have to all forget that you belong
to this community

21:17.132 --> 21:20.222
or that community. Just learn to share.

21:20.423 --> 21:25.444
The highest thing, the highest material
thing that is created in this world,

21:25.645 --> 21:30.659
even above flowers and everything,
are human beings.

21:30.860 --> 21:33.190
Just share them, just enjoy them.

21:33.391 --> 21:37.736
They are the best thing God has produced.

21:38.197 --> 21:40.341
Just enjoy them.

21:40.542 --> 21:51.032
This is what is necessary if you really
want to obey the laws of God.

21:51.233 --> 21:59.304
Today, I hope with this puja, your heart
will enlarge, you see.

21:59.505 --> 22:05.573
And that you will learn to share with
that big heart.

22:05.774 --> 22:09.266
Just try to share your things.

22:09.467 --> 22:14.595
Share your time. Share your comforts.

22:14.796 --> 22:18.802
Share every moment of your life with
others.

22:19.003 --> 22:21.836
Think of good things of other people,
you’ll enjoy them.

22:22.009 --> 22:25.465
If you start thinking of the thorns instead
of the roses,

22:25.666 --> 22:28.774
will you enjoy roses? If you have to enjoy
the roses,

22:28.975 --> 22:30.764
you have to forget the thorns and enjoy
the roses.

22:30.965 --> 22:34.775
Those who are wise are like that. But
stupid can take the thorns

22:34.976 --> 22:40.923
and just go on pricking themselves and
saying that “Oh! There are thorns.”

22:41.153 --> 22:44.439
The sign of wisdom is to enjoy the beauty
of roses,

22:44.640 --> 22:47.104
they are the most beautiful things.

22:47.305 --> 22:52.542
They are all roses, I see you all roses
here, and I forget the thorns.

22:52.743 --> 22:56.035
And the day will come they will not need
even the thorns,

22:56.236 --> 23:00.002
because they will be so powerful.

23:00.816 --> 23:03.073
And there should be no groupism
of any kind,

23:03.274 --> 23:05.440
of intellectuals coming together,

23:05.641 --> 23:08.737
non-intellectuals coming together,
alcoholics on one side.

23:08.938 --> 23:14.204
In Sahaja Yoga also we have caste system,
just imagine.

23:15.669 --> 23:18.910
Then some Indians are separate, then
English are separate.

23:19.111 --> 23:25.466
Then Cambridge people are separate.
There should be no separation.

23:26.335 --> 23:31.298
We are all one. We are all born through
our Sahasrara.

23:31.499 --> 23:34.146
We are a different community and
a different thing.

23:34.347 --> 23:37.411
We cannot form into groups, cannot form
into cults,

23:37.612 --> 23:42.726
and cannot form into any caste.

23:42.927 --> 23:46.244
We are all twice born people.

23:46.445 --> 23:50.024
We are the people who are born again.
We are different.

23:50.225 --> 23:53.880
We have lost all that. Everything is lost,
you see.

23:54.081 --> 23:57.646
They say there is no caste for a sanyasi,
for an ascetic,

23:57.847 --> 24:00.710
means the one who is a realized soul,
there is no caste.

24:00.911 --> 24:04.014
You don’t belong to any caste. Forget
your problems of your country,

24:04.215 --> 24:10.675
of your nation, of your, so called your
people. Forget it, you are different.

24:10.876 --> 24:15.187
And try to pull them up to that where
they also become one with Whole.

24:15.388 --> 24:18.538
The whole world has to unite like this.

24:18.739 --> 24:23.416
Give up your small, small differences
and angularities.

24:23.617 --> 24:26.769
My God Bless you all.
