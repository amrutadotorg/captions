WEBVTT

00:02.041 --> 00:05.291
And so there are many

00:05.500 --> 00:09.709
hunters who are trying to find out this castori, this musk,

00:09.917 --> 00:13.458
and they are looking

00:13.667 --> 00:19.667
they are looking for the deer.

00:21.125 --> 00:25.000
So please keep your deer, that is the innocence, you see.

00:25.208 --> 00:28.834
The children’s innocence is now attacked, under attack,

00:29.000 --> 00:31.792
and there is such an attack coming on innocence

00:31.999 --> 00:35.250
that you have to care, be careful about your own children.

00:35.458 --> 00:38.333
Harane means those deer,

00:38.542 --> 00:40.041
because deer is a small thing,

00:40.250 --> 00:43.166
so be careful about those deer, look after them.

00:43.375 --> 00:47.375
The full term is keep them clear, keep them safe.

00:51.625 --> 00:54.625
A time may come when we will feel our own breathing

00:54.834 --> 00:56.542
as something stranger

00:56.750 --> 00:59.750
as if they are not our own, stranger,

01:02.333 --> 01:06.208
that’s why keep your hands into each other

01:07.375 --> 01:08.959
because it is very dark.

01:09.125 --> 01:12.000
Very nice message for all the Sahaja Yogis.

01:12.208 --> 01:14.166
And this is what one has to understand

01:14.583 --> 01:20.750
that you must try to understand your leader.

01:20.999 --> 01:25.917
I wanted to talk to the collectivity here today

01:26.500 --> 01:29.208
about

01:29.500 --> 01:32.750
what has happened in Switzerland, also

01:32.999 --> 01:36.000
that, you see, we had Arneau here,

01:36.208 --> 01:40.125
and Arneau became a very right-sided and this and that.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.750
So as a result of that,

01:43.542 --> 01:46.959
Swiss people have become the other way round, I think.

01:47.500 --> 01:51.999
And it's a kind of a feeling

01:53.417 --> 01:55.667
that as Arneau was,

01:55.875 --> 01:59.166
there's a pressure I think, on the new leader

01:59.375 --> 02:01.417
who is a very good man and he is very good.

02:01.625 --> 02:05.750
So if you pressurize, then nothing will work out.

02:06.458 --> 02:09.792
So please remember that you have to listen to your leaders,

02:09.999 --> 02:12.083
till I do something about it.

02:12.291 --> 02:15.166
Even about Arneau, I stood by him out and out,

02:15.375 --> 02:17.417
and when he was wrong we removed him.

02:17.625 --> 02:19.333
So nobody should challenge the leader,

02:19.542 --> 02:25.125
otherwise there cannot be any one of My authorities -

02:25.333 --> 02:27.125
nothing can flow.

02:27.333 --> 02:32.125
It's like stopping completely the flow of Kundalini.

02:32.333 --> 02:34.417
So don't challenge your leaders.

02:34.625 --> 02:38.667
I find that there is a big, I find here very clearly,

02:38.875 --> 02:42.333
the Agnya is rising in people. People are developing Agnyas,

02:42.542 --> 02:45.583
and that is coming only because

02:45.792 --> 02:49.875
one thinks, "Oh, that was Arneau. He did like this...

02:50.667 --> 02:51.500
and now Mathias.

02:51.709 --> 02:54.500
So Mathias must be also like that, for he is authority."

02:54.750 --> 02:57.625
That's not the way. You have to accept his authority.

02:57.834 --> 03:00.041
If you don't accept his authority, your Agnya will be caught up

03:00.291 --> 03:02.291
and you will become very right-sided people.

03:02.542 --> 03:05.166
Be extremely careful. I am noticing

03:05.417 --> 03:08.041
that the Agnya in Switzerland is quite high

03:08.291 --> 03:12.083
and I must tell you, warn you, that be sensible.

03:12.291 --> 03:18.417
My whole energy flows through your leader, till he stops it.

03:18.709 --> 03:21.417
So I am in charge there to look after that point.

03:21.667 --> 03:25.583
Now you people have to learn to surrender yourself.

03:25.834 --> 03:28.834
Otherwise your ego will go up very much

03:29.000 --> 03:32.333
and you will all, I am sure, if you go on like this,

03:32.542 --> 03:36.333
one by one become very egoistical.

03:36.709 --> 03:38.999
Now, how ego comes so much to the West,

03:39.166 --> 03:41.999
I have studied it and I have found out the reason for this

03:42.166 --> 03:45.417
why these people in the West are so ego-oriented.

03:45.709 --> 03:47.875
What is the reason?

03:48.375 --> 03:49.291
The reason is like this:

03:49.500 --> 03:52.999
a child till the age of five years is ego-oriented.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.458
He plays with his own, you give them toys

03:55.667 --> 03:58.625
they will all have their own toys, they will play with them

03:58.834 --> 04:01.333
and they will not trouble each other.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.417
But if they trouble each other,

04:03.625 --> 04:09.041
then they become violent or they could be quite brutal also.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.625
They are always living in a parallel way.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.041
You do your job; I do my job. If you leave them,

04:14.250 --> 04:16.834
"This is mine. This is mine," they'll all play alone.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.792
And they are at that time absolutely ego-oriented.

04:19.999 --> 04:21.875
If you ask a child,

04:22.041 --> 04:24.250
"You are standing there, now what do you see?"

04:24.458 --> 04:27.999
so he'll see this chair, he'll see Me, he'll see this and that.

04:28.291 --> 04:32.417
From there, if you ask, he won't say that he sees something else -

04:32.709 --> 04:36.125
he will say same as he sees here - he is standing this side,

04:36.333 --> 04:40.166
but he will never see the point of another person.

04:41.041 --> 04:44.500
That's the child. Say, for example, there is a wall here,

04:44.750 --> 04:48.125
the child is standing here and there is something in between.

04:48.417 --> 04:52.208
So you ask the child, "What will you see from the other side?"

04:52.542 --> 04:54.959
He will say the same thing from where he is standing.

04:55.125 --> 04:58.917
He won't be able to say what the other person is seeing.

04:59.291 --> 05:02.709
So that is this ego-orientation, is very strong.

05:02.959 --> 05:06.999
And because you people, I must say this is a very,

05:07.166 --> 05:11.041
I think, a statement I have to make very clearly

05:11.333 --> 05:14.041
that in your culture whatever is -

05:14.291 --> 05:16.834
so today's culture of these countries, today's I am saying -

05:17.208 --> 05:20.333
is that it just develops your ego.

05:20.542 --> 05:23.417
Parents are very happy if you are busy with yourself.

05:23.875 --> 05:25.500
They don't want to take up any responsibility,

05:25.709 --> 05:27.500
they don't want to correct you, they don't want to tell you,

05:27.709 --> 05:29.291
"Don't do this, don't do that,"

05:29.500 --> 05:32.166
and whichever way the children are going, they are going.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.250
They don't want to worry. Even,

05:34.500 --> 05:38.458
what I have noticed in the ashrams also, if somebody corrects the child,

05:38.667 --> 05:40.291
they have a big objection.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.333
They are very sensitive about their children, and this is very bad

05:43.542 --> 05:46.917
because this will make the children extremely ego-oriented.

05:47.208 --> 05:48.291
And in the West I have seen

05:48.500 --> 05:50.959
people are extremely sensitive about their children.

05:51.166 --> 05:54.208
Nobody dare say anything to them. But the other way round,

05:54.417 --> 05:57.999
I must say that Indian culture has still kept very sensible ways.

05:58.250 --> 06:01.208
That's why their society is the best in the whole world.

06:01.417 --> 06:03.959
Their economics is horrible, their politics is worst,

06:04.125 --> 06:06.542
you can call them absolutely useless for many things,

06:06.750 --> 06:09.166
but on society level, they are the best.

06:09.417 --> 06:13.458
The reason is that the women have taken over the responsibility

06:13.667 --> 06:15.375
of looking after the society.

06:15.583 --> 06:16.750
Now I'll tell you we were quite grown up,

06:16.959 --> 06:19.417
I was in college, my sisters were also in college.

06:19.625 --> 06:22.333
One day we were coming by, walking down,

06:22.625 --> 06:25.792
and we were just, there was some joke so they all started laughing,

06:25.999 --> 06:27.375
there were some friends also.

06:27.625 --> 06:30.458
And one lady was going by car - my mother's friend.

06:30.709 --> 06:32.333
So she went and told my mother that

06:32.542 --> 06:34.083
"I saw your daughters with other friends

06:34.333 --> 06:35.583
and they were laughing on the street."

06:35.792 --> 06:38.999
As soon as we went she shouted,

06:39.417 --> 06:42.000
"How dare you?"

06:42.875 --> 06:45.917
We got a fright, and we didn't know this lady was coming from that side.

06:46.166 --> 06:50.500
She said, "How dare you? How could you do?" - at that age.

06:50.875 --> 06:54.041
And anyone of her friends could scold us, anybody.

06:54.583 --> 06:56.375
Can say anything to us, "Don't do like this.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.917
Why are you doing like this?"

06:58.166 --> 06:59.208
So this ego breaks.

06:59.417 --> 07:02.083
But if you do not allow others to correct your children,

07:02.333 --> 07:04.959
their ego will never break, and that is the reason why

07:05.166 --> 07:08.625
in these countries - Western countries - people are so ego-oriented.

07:08.959 --> 07:11.125
They have not grown out of it.

07:11.333 --> 07:12.750
They have not grown out of it.

07:12.959 --> 07:16.542
First of all, they never want to be corrected, never.

07:16.750 --> 07:21.667
Even at this age, if My mother was living she would have corrected Me.

07:21.999 --> 07:23.291
And I would never have felt bad -

07:23.500 --> 07:26.291
anybody, anyone of our friends or anybody - because I know

07:26.500 --> 07:29.834
that it's for My benevolence why are they doing it.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.875
But a kind of a, you see,

07:33.083 --> 07:37.000
thing that happened here, that Arneau went too much on one side.

07:37.375 --> 07:39.625
He got possessed, went too much,

07:39.875 --> 07:42.458
and this is also by some other people also.

07:42.709 --> 07:46.542
Also Patrick is having the same problem there,

07:46.875 --> 07:50.333
and everybody is having the same problem in every ashram.

07:50.709 --> 07:54.000
Now it is not that you should dominate your children or anything,

07:54.250 --> 07:58.583
but if they are doing wrong, immediately the person

07:58.959 --> 08:02.875
who sees he's doing wrong can correct it.

08:03.208 --> 08:04.375
There should not be that,

08:04.583 --> 08:07.667
"This is my child. How dare you say like that?" or feel bad about it.

08:07.959 --> 08:11.917
Once you start developing that kind of "my children, mine,"

08:12.125 --> 08:15.792
children then become absolutely ego-oriented,

08:16.291 --> 08:18.542
and you'll never allow them to grow out of it.

08:18.750 --> 08:21.792
They can never see what is the other's point of view.

08:22.041 --> 08:23.375
Now say, for example,

08:23.625 --> 08:26.417
we learnt it through, not only through our mother, father,

08:26.667 --> 08:29.583
but through everybody else. They said, "You should not do like this."

08:29.875 --> 08:32.166
So many things we know - little, little things.

08:32.417 --> 08:36.166
Like these girls told Me - not these but from another ashram,

08:36.500 --> 08:37.583
not in Switzerland

08:37.834 --> 08:39.792
- that, "Look at them. They come from the heat

08:39.999 --> 08:42.333
and just take the water, drink it."

08:42.709 --> 08:45.709
In India nobody would do. How, how do we know?

08:45.917 --> 08:48.291
Because if anybody sees us doing that, he'll say,

08:48.542 --> 08:51.750
"No, you should eat something, take some carbohydrate, then drink water.

08:52.041 --> 08:55.083
Why did you take it?"

08:55.500 --> 08:57.041
And nobody will object.

08:57.250 --> 09:00.375
So the whole society is training the children.

09:00.667 --> 09:04.083
Nobody has any objection.

09:05.375 --> 09:07.750
Guido had a problem also, same way.

09:07.959 --> 09:10.750
He tried to correct the children, the parents used to comment -

09:10.959 --> 09:13.959
In India nobody dare say anything to the teacher.

09:14.125 --> 09:18.709
That's why the teachers are respected. If teacher said so, all right.

09:18.999 --> 09:21.083
They have no respect for their teachers. They have no respect -

09:21.291 --> 09:23.542
after all, they don't even have respect for their parents.

09:23.750 --> 09:27.458
because they discover that we are ego-oriented.

09:28.291 --> 09:31.208
Here, the way children talk to their parents, the way they behave,

09:31.500 --> 09:33.750
they have no respect for anyone,

09:33.959 --> 09:35.834
and then they have no respect for themselves.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.542
They become absolutely shameless people.

09:40.333 --> 09:42.750
So, to make your children grow properly,

09:42.959 --> 09:45.333
allow them to get into collectivity completely.

09:45.625 --> 09:49.458
I mean, now My husband's family, we have got hundred people at least.

09:49.750 --> 09:53.333
When we come together for any marriage, festival or anything,

09:53.542 --> 09:58.500
we are at least minimum hundred people living under one roof, one kitchen.

09:58.917 --> 10:02.583
And everybody knows how far to go. Nobody feels bad.

10:02.792 --> 10:04.750
I mean they, of course, love children also,

10:04.999 --> 10:06.542
they do everything for them -

10:06.750 --> 10:10.625
but if it is to be corrected, it is to be corrected,

10:10.999 --> 10:12.625
and nobody feels bad.

10:12.834 --> 10:15.625
And this is why the children get attached too much,

10:15.834 --> 10:18.875
and it's impossible to penetrate into their ego shell.

10:19.083 --> 10:21.542
It goes on, you see, growing, growing, growing.

10:21.834 --> 10:24.208
And even if they get realization later on,

10:24.542 --> 10:26.583
even if they feel, the ego is still there

10:26.792 --> 10:29.375
because it's already bloated out by the parents,

10:29.625 --> 10:32.917
parents have already put that ego into their heads

10:33.125 --> 10:36.625
that, "You are something special."

10:38.083 --> 10:40.875
And this is how it is. I mean, the other day,

10:41.041 --> 10:44.458
I mean, my younger daughter - she is quite big and all that -

10:44.667 --> 10:47.959
she was in there

10:48.333 --> 10:51.667
and she started scolding her daughter.

10:51.999 --> 10:53.709
So Worlikar came and said,

10:53.917 --> 10:57.041
"Please don't scold. I will not listen anymore of this."

10:57.333 --> 11:01.583
She just kept quiet. She didn't feel bad about it.

11:03.083 --> 11:07.583
She didn't feel bad because, you see, we Indians understand this.

11:08.417 --> 11:12.500
Anybody can correct us, and we take it as good thing.

11:12.709 --> 11:15.125
Thank God there is somebody to correct us.

11:15.333 --> 11:19.208
Otherwise we will be hanging from the trees.

11:20.166 --> 11:22.709
Like Avdhut once asked Me when he was small,

11:22.917 --> 11:25.291
he said, "Supposing we leave our parents,

11:25.542 --> 11:28.667
then the bhoots go away - what parents have - their bhoots go away?"

11:28.875 --> 11:31.417
I said, "No, they will go with you."

11:31.625 --> 11:35.291
So he said, "Then why do these people leave their parents?

11:35.709 --> 11:37.750
Because supposing I go away from my parents

11:37.959 --> 11:40.792
and tomorrow I feel like smoking, who will correct me?

11:40.999 --> 11:44.667
There is nobody to correct me if my parents are not with me."

11:45.041 --> 11:48.959
I mean, that is regarded as something, a great blessing

11:49.125 --> 11:52.417
that you have parents, your elders, to correct you,

11:52.625 --> 11:55.999
to tell you something. And when my daughters got married,

11:56.166 --> 11:58.959
we were big people - I mean, we were not young or anything,

11:59.125 --> 12:04.333
CP was the Chairman of Shipping Corporation and all that -

12:04.542 --> 12:08.041
his sister, she is about eight, nine years older,

12:08.333 --> 12:10.250
she said, "For this marriage you have to paint your nails."

12:10.458 --> 12:12.542
Now imagine CP painting his nails.

12:13.583 --> 12:17.208
He did paint. He painted,

12:17.500 --> 12:21.208
and then he had to wear dhoti ten times. He had to do this,

12:21.458 --> 12:23.083
he was quite (inaudible).

12:23.291 --> 12:25.917
We went to another marriage in the, something.

12:26.208 --> 12:28.500
He said, "Look at them. They are also wearing suits and everything."

12:28.709 --> 12:32.458
I said, "Thank God we have, you have a sister."

12:33.375 --> 12:37.125
Somebody who will tell you what is to be done.

12:38.709 --> 12:43.417
This obedience you must learn. Unless and until you learn obedience and

12:43.667 --> 12:47.542
anybody corrects your child, don't say anything. Just don't say anything.

12:47.792 --> 12:50.083
Let your child be handled by everyone.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.667
Otherwise it's going to be very bad for them also.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.500
Though they are born-realized,

12:54.750 --> 12:59.750
you are not giving them the right training, no.

13:01.333 --> 13:04.583
"My children" should be dropped out immediately.

13:04.792 --> 13:09.041
They are children of everyone.

13:11.917 --> 13:15.250
Now Anand came and stayed with him. Ask him what sort of a boy he was.

13:15.583 --> 13:16.583
[Sahaja Yogi: A gem.]

13:16.875 --> 13:20.208
Gem of a person. If, if he tells him, "Anand, don't do like this,"

13:20.417 --> 13:22.250
he will never feel bad, never.

13:22.458 --> 13:26.792
We feel it's a blessing there is somebody to tell us.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.500
And then this is what I find later on that ego is like a balloon.

13:34.709 --> 13:38.333
If the balloon, if you do not blow at all- it is not blown out,

13:38.542 --> 13:39.792
then it's difficult to blow it.

13:39.999 --> 13:43.792
That's why those who have not developed this ego are very easy.

13:43.999 --> 13:46.500
That's why Indians don't get into this ego trip easily.

13:46.750 --> 13:49.667
Their balloon is never allowed to grow.

13:49.917 --> 13:53.250
But those who are in the West, they are nothing but ego.

13:53.542 --> 13:57.750
You do something, you know, balloon starts.

13:58.208 --> 14:01.417
Then we had one (inaudible) with us,

14:01.625 --> 14:03.500
and whenever he got into the car,

14:03.709 --> 14:06.834
he used to become very funny, you know, very bumptious.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.417
So I asked somebody, "Why is he so bumptious?"

14:09.667 --> 14:11.999
He said, "Mother because he is driving Mercedes."

14:12.166 --> 14:15.583
I said, "What? Mercedes?

14:15.875 --> 14:18.999
This is neither his nor Mine . Why should he be proud of it?"

14:19.166 --> 14:22.208
I mean, something stupid.

14:23.125 --> 14:26.417
So an ego makes you stupid.

14:26.625 --> 14:30.999
That's the main thing: it makes you completely stupid.

14:32.166 --> 14:34.583
And there is a big story about it in Ramayana.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.917
how a person can become stupid.

14:37.166 --> 14:40.500
And that's why you people are stupefied very easily.

14:40.709 --> 14:45.583
Recently somebody told Me, "Mother, the new fashions have started

14:46.041 --> 14:48.625
that they take, all the ladies take their hair like this

14:48.834 --> 14:50.959
on their forehead." I said, "Really?"

14:51.125 --> 14:53.417
She said, "Yes, you see, Mother."

14:53.625 --> 14:56.834
I saw all the Sahaja Yoginis having their hair made like that.

14:57.041 --> 15:00.667
Yesterday also in the program all of them having hair like this.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.417
I mean, they have no personality.

15:02.625 --> 15:05.333
Anybody starts anything, they'll do it.

15:05.999 --> 15:09.125
They have no individuality.

15:11.250 --> 15:15.834
They do not have any traditional basis.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.834
"No, this is modern dress. I am not going to wear something like this.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.625
This is how I dress up,

15:20.834 --> 15:23.083
this is how I live. Why, why should I do it?"

15:23.333 --> 15:25.792
Now, tomorrow they'll say that you have a bouffant.

15:25.999 --> 15:28.041
So everybody going with a bouffant.

15:28.291 --> 15:30.917
They will say men should have, women should have put no oil.

15:31.083 --> 15:34.542
So they will become bald-headed, - finished.

15:34.875 --> 15:37.875
But, you see, about twenty years back every man

15:38.125 --> 15:40.083
you see in the films used to put the hair,

15:40.291 --> 15:42.166
oil in the hair, properly comb it,

15:42.375 --> 15:44.083
and used to be a smart fellow.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.417
Nowadays, everybody is so casually dressed

15:46.750 --> 15:48.583
there's nothing smartness about them.

15:48.792 --> 15:53.875
If you become casual, you'll also in life will be casual.

15:54.834 --> 15:58.250
To wear some sort of a casual thing, some sort of a baggy pant

15:58.458 --> 16:00.250
or a tight pant or this and that,

16:00.458 --> 16:02.417
this is because there is no personality.

16:02.625 --> 16:08.875
Is only ego. There is no personality; there's no wisdom.

16:10.083 --> 16:14.917
To allow your children to be corrected by others

16:15.083 --> 16:18.000
is the first thing you, good thing you do to your children.

16:18.208 --> 16:19.999
Let them have respect for others.

16:20.166 --> 16:21.834
Let them feel, "They are also my uncles.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.291
They are also my aunties. They can correct me."

16:26.999 --> 16:31.250
Then, to obey and not to question too much.

16:31.542 --> 16:33.999
I mean, here every child there was, once I was traveling

16:34.166 --> 16:37.083
with a Sahaja Yogini. Her son was all the time asking,

16:37.291 --> 16:40.583
"Why this? Why that?"

16:41.166 --> 16:42.667
and she was answering him.

16:42.959 --> 16:45.834
I said, "You shut up now," to that boy,

16:46.166 --> 16:48.999
and after that he never asked her why.

16:49.208 --> 16:51.417
As if they have a right to ask you,

16:51.625 --> 16:55.166
they go on asking questions.

16:56.625 --> 17:00.208
How dare they ask you questions? You are parents.

17:00.667 --> 17:05.333
We don't ask questions to our parents - never, never.

17:08.291 --> 17:12.625
We are no way less than anybody else in this world.

17:14.417 --> 17:17.917
On the contrary, I must say that in that culture those people

17:18.166 --> 17:21.250
who have come up are very good Sahaja Yogis.

17:21.458 --> 17:26.500
They are very sensible. They understand how far to go, what to do.

17:26.875 --> 17:29.458
So what is we have to understand

17:29.709 --> 17:31.959
that our Sahaja Yoga culture is such

17:32.166 --> 17:34.166
that we have to learn certain things.

17:34.417 --> 17:37.583
First of all, at least please don't make your children

17:37.834 --> 17:42.208
so much what you call ego-oriented.

17:43.250 --> 17:45.125
Don't make them ego-oriented, please.

17:45.333 --> 17:48.834
See that your children respect all of them the same way,

17:49.000 --> 17:50.709
they say "Namaste" to everyone,

17:50.917 --> 17:55.250
and they are very, very obedient to everyone and even

17:55.458 --> 17:59.375
if somebody corrects them, what's the harm?

18:01.709 --> 18:05.333
I am really surprised because in the West

18:06.166 --> 18:09.959
I used to think that the children are not attached to their parents or anything,

18:10.166 --> 18:12.458
but it's not so, because they are glued to parents.

18:12.667 --> 18:13.458
Not only glued,

18:13.709 --> 18:17.208
but as soon as they get a chance they run away from the parents,

18:17.625 --> 18:21.125
because you dote too much on their heads, you see.

18:21.709 --> 18:24.333
That's why.

18:25.417 --> 18:26.917
There is no freedom.

18:27.083 --> 18:28.542
All the time they are jealous.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.583
I have heard also of ladies

18:30.792 --> 18:34.208
who are jealous of Me because I am the Mother.

18:36.709 --> 18:39.000
Yes, so stupid.

18:39.208 --> 18:40.083
I find, I mean

18:40.291 --> 18:43.291
if supposing somebody mothers my child I will look after that lady.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.959
I'll send her a sari. I'll send her a present.

18:46.125 --> 18:50.000
I'll be very happy that you have looked after my child.

18:52.125 --> 18:54.333
Reactions are so funny, isn't it?

18:54.583 --> 18:57.250
Why such responses and reactions?

18:57.667 --> 19:00.083
Like supposing you have music program in here,

19:00.291 --> 19:03.125
your neighbors will come, go to the police, call everybody.

19:03.375 --> 19:07.000
Otherwise, even if you are dying they will not be bothered.

19:07.917 --> 19:11.750
On the contrary, in India supposing you have a music,

19:12.125 --> 19:13.917
"Oh God, they are going to have the music."

19:14.125 --> 19:17.250
It's all right . Bring everything, carpets for them, everything.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.500
Give them food -

19:18.709 --> 19:23.542
"What will you have?" and the whole area will be there to help you

19:23.750 --> 19:29.792
and this and that. And they'll sleep nicely, if they want to sleep.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.834
Their collectivity is very good and you see their children,

19:36.125 --> 19:41.375
anybody scolds any child there, anybody.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.999
Because you are ego-oriented, please be careful

19:47.166 --> 19:50.417
don't make your children also ego-oriented.

19:50.834 --> 19:54.709
It's so difficult for you to get rid of your egos, you know that.

19:55.291 --> 20:01.041
Anything, you know, like a snake is there, again back.

20:03.709 --> 20:06.917
Then I used to wonder how is it their ego comes up?

20:07.375 --> 20:10.375
This (inaudible) told Me, "My husband, you know, Mother,

20:10.583 --> 20:13.542
what is this ego, ego, ego?"  I said, "What?"

20:13.999 --> 20:16.333
"He always tells me I have got ego, ego, ego. What is this?"

20:16.542 --> 20:19.999
she asked Me. "What is this disease, ego?

20:20.166 --> 20:21.750
Ego, ego, ego?"

20:21.959 --> 20:24.999
I said, "You see, it means Ahamkar."

20:25.250 --> 20:28.834
She said, "Then why does he boast of it?"

20:29.458 --> 20:31.875
Ahamkar is a sin.

20:32.083 --> 20:34.583
Even to say "I hate you," it's a sinful thing to say.

20:34.792 --> 20:37.041
I mean, in Hindi language if you say, "I hate you," they'll say,

20:37.250 --> 20:39.834
"Are you mad or what?" They think you must be mad.

20:40.041 --> 20:43.625
You cannot say that I commit this sin.

20:46.625 --> 20:47.542
So this is what it is,

20:47.750 --> 20:51.999
and anybody who is treated like that, even in India, can become bad

20:52.291 --> 20:56.333
- even in India - pampered too much by parents

20:56.625 --> 21:00.208
or sort of made too much of them and all that.

21:01.959 --> 21:05.959
But we know our parents love us, they care for us.

21:06.834 --> 21:10.458
My mother was such a strict person as far as strictness,

21:10.667 --> 21:13.417
but today why I am cooking so well? Because of My mother.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.834
She used to tell Me even how to hold the

21:17.333 --> 21:20.458
- what you call - the spoon.

21:20.667 --> 21:24.291
When I was a very small little girl about five years old, I know,

21:24.625 --> 21:26.959
Then we have this tawa, is a very black thing, round,

21:27.125 --> 21:28.792
where we make rotis.

21:28.999 --> 21:30.125
She used to tell Me, "Clean it."

21:30.333 --> 21:32.250
And we had so many servants in the house

21:32.542 --> 21:34.999
but still, and I remember My small little white hands

21:35.166 --> 21:38.542
all becoming black like this, you see, and I would clean it.

21:38.834 --> 21:42.542
But I am very good at cleaning. I am very good at everything. How?

21:42.834 --> 21:45.999
It's thanks to My mother.

21:46.999 --> 21:48.375
Nothing doing.

21:48.583 --> 21:52.208
Now at least make your children get up in the morning.

21:53.625 --> 21:56.792
We have to give something better to our children

21:57.000 --> 21:59.500
better training. Same I have seen with ladies.

21:59.709 --> 22:03.458
Now ladies must understand that those who live here

22:03.709 --> 22:08.125
or in any ashram, they are the housewives and they have to know.

22:08.417 --> 22:11.917
I was surprised when I asked the people who have come from all the way,

22:12.125 --> 22:15.500
"What did you have?" They said, "Nothing. We had those samosas

22:15.750 --> 22:17.917
and something to eat. That's all."

22:18.250 --> 22:21.999
I mean, that they are guests in the house.

22:23.083 --> 22:25.709
Nobody had anything. I was having all kinds of food

22:25.917 --> 22:28.542
but I never knew that they are making like this.

22:28.792 --> 22:30.875
I mean, not to feel bad. Otherwise if I say something

22:31.041 --> 22:33.417
you'll catch on Center Heart, not for that.

22:33.834 --> 22:37.500
This is another specialty because of ego only.

22:37.709 --> 22:41.542
This is because there is nothing goes inside the head;

22:41.792 --> 22:45.250
nothing goes inside the heart. It goes into some center, you know.

22:45.709 --> 22:48.834
Mother said so? All right, Center Heart is catching,

22:50.750 --> 22:52.458
or my Left Vishuddhi is catching.

22:52.667 --> 22:55.333
Baba, but no, why don't you correct your brain?

22:55.542 --> 22:58.750
Because we don't want to face it. We don't want to correct it.

22:58.959 --> 23:02.917
So put it in the Left Vishuddhi or in the Center Heart.

23:04.583 --> 23:07.583
Now if some guests come to your house -

23:07.792 --> 23:09.375
Gregoire will tell you, one day

23:09.583 --> 23:11.542
they were all there, about twenty-five of them,

23:11.792 --> 23:13.166
sitting in the gallery. My daughter was there.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.417
I went and told her that, "They are there,

23:15.667 --> 23:18.208
they may stay on longer. So you better cook for all of them."

23:18.500 --> 23:19.959
She had done the cooking.

23:20.125 --> 23:21.583
When we finished - remember, Gregoire,

23:21.792 --> 23:24.458
we finished our program - I said, "Let's have dinner."

23:24.709 --> 23:26.250
So they were surprised. They said, "How?"

23:26.458 --> 23:27.999
I said, "I told her. She must have prepared."

23:28.166 --> 23:30.750
"In such a short time?" I said, "Yes, she must have prepared.'

23:30.999 --> 23:33.041
She said, "Dinner is ready." We were all there.

23:33.375 --> 23:34.667
She said if you tell somebody

23:34.875 --> 23:36.959
that twenty-five people are going to come,

23:37.125 --> 23:39.792
the women will be finished, like that.

23:39.999 --> 23:42.166
They'll be thinking, "Now, I have to go for shopping..."

23:42.417 --> 23:45.458
They start ...

23:47.500 --> 23:49.542
And there is no confidence. There is no,

23:49.750 --> 23:53.750
because no personality, no personality.

23:54.583 --> 23:58.500
My husband, I told him yesterday that I have made pulao for people,

23:58.750 --> 24:01.750
hundred people, that's all. I didn't do too much.

24:02.166 --> 24:04.166
He said, "Hundred people is nothing?" I said, "No, nothing.

24:04.375 --> 24:06.208
Five hundred would have been more, but -"

24:06.458 --> 24:09.750
but not only Me,

24:09.959 --> 24:12.458
My daughter can do it. You have seen her in Pratishthan.

24:12.709 --> 24:15.125
My daughters can do it.

24:15.333 --> 24:20.291
So we have self-confidence, you see, about anything you tell us.

24:20.875 --> 24:23.291
Now all of your programs you have seen, you go on the tours,

24:23.500 --> 24:28.041
how Indians arrange everything, in jungles, in anything.

24:28.375 --> 24:30.458
But here first we start thinking,

24:30.709 --> 24:33.875
thinking, because we don't want to face the problem.

24:34.458 --> 24:36.333
"We have to do it now. Let's do it."

24:36.542 --> 24:41.208
"That's not so. Let us sit down but plan out," you're finished then.

24:44.542 --> 24:46.041
Now I have studied you too well.

24:46.291 --> 24:49.542
I have been here, I am amazed, also.

24:49.875 --> 24:53.834
And there is no training because your mother also avoids to train you.

24:54.000 --> 24:55.792
There is no training - nothing.

24:55.999 --> 24:58.000
They don't know anything, I would say.

24:58.208 --> 25:01.458
They are still like little babies.

25:02.375 --> 25:03.208
There has to be,

25:03.458 --> 25:07.542
a girl must know how to stitch, a girl must know how to cook,

25:07.750 --> 25:12.333
a girl must know how to look after a household, and shopping,

25:12.542 --> 25:14.792
and she must know what is good meat, what is bad meat.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.208
She must know about what is a diamond, which is not a diamond;

25:18.458 --> 25:22.917
which is silk, which is not. All this is taught in the family.

25:23.999 --> 25:25.792
Whether you are a career girl or not

25:25.999 --> 25:27.542
- you are a career girl, all right -

25:27.792 --> 25:32.375
but this is the main thing. This is the basis for a woman to know.

25:36.458 --> 25:39.291
We are women without being women.

25:39.583 --> 25:43.333
And then a kind of a fondness,

25:43.667 --> 25:46.250
to do for others, to give something.

25:46.500 --> 25:49.208
I will tell you about my granddaughter. When they were young,

25:49.417 --> 25:52.166
both, three of them,  I asked them, "What you want to be?"

25:52.375 --> 25:56.750
They said, "We want to be a nurse or to be an air hostess."

25:56.999 --> 25:59.041
So I said, "Why these two?"

25:59.250 --> 26:00.834
She said, "You know, Grandma,

26:01.000 --> 26:06.250
only in these two professions you can give food to others to eat."

26:07.417 --> 26:09.709
See how, how they feel.

26:09.959 --> 26:14.417
And recently about a year back - she is only 18, elder one -

26:14.625 --> 26:16.834
she invited twenty-five people for dinner.

26:17.041 --> 26:19.000
So I thought she is going to tell the servants or someone.

26:19.208 --> 26:20.667
She said, "No, I am going to do the cooking."

26:20.917 --> 26:25.999
And she did it and she fed everyone and everybody started praising.

26:26.250 --> 26:27.999
She said, "No, no, no. You know, they are just saying it

26:28.208 --> 26:30.291
because I have cooked but I know it's all insipid.

26:30.542 --> 26:32.000
It's all insipid. It's nothing good.

26:32.250 --> 26:34.208
But they are just saying it because I have cooked."

26:34.458 --> 26:38.333
For twenty-five people she cooked alone.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.250
Because they feel happy to do it,

26:42.583 --> 26:45.625
They're happy to give things to others.

26:46.083 --> 26:49.041
They are so happy, you don't know.

26:49.667 --> 26:52.125
It's just you are so affluent, you are so rich,

26:52.375 --> 26:57.333
you have everything, but still there is no generosity.

27:01.333 --> 27:03.291
My husband is extremely generous

27:03.542 --> 27:07.166
but the other day there was a gentleman - a Sahaja Yogi.

27:07.458 --> 27:09.959
An elderly gentleman who was a teacher of art

27:10.166 --> 27:11.792
came to do a little drawing for Me.

27:12.083 --> 27:13.500
I said, "What to give?" I told C.P.

27:13.709 --> 27:16.875
"C.P., have you got any suit with you spare?"

27:17.166 --> 27:18.125
He said, "Maybe. Let's go and see."

27:18.333 --> 27:19.959
I said, "I've seen one. Will you see that?"

27:20.125 --> 27:22.166
That's an excellent suit he had.

27:22.375 --> 27:24.709
"Oh!" he said, "please give this one. Is very good.

27:24.959 --> 27:27.458
I have only used it once but I have never used it outside;

27:27.667 --> 27:30.834
just I have tried it. So if he likes, please give him."

27:31.041 --> 27:34.458
So he took the - and when I gave him he was very happy and he said,

27:34.667 --> 27:38.959
"Mother, I was looking out for a suit and I've wanted one suit."

27:39.208 --> 27:42.667
C.P.'s eyes were filled with joy, and his tears,

27:42.999 --> 27:45.583
He said, "You know, he wanted the suit, do you know?

27:45.792 --> 27:49.417
How nice we gave him what he wanted."

27:50.208 --> 27:53.750
See the delicacy of character

27:54.333 --> 27:57.834
- so overjoyed that he wanted the suit -

27:58.041 --> 28:00.291
and because I am very good at what one wants, you see,

28:00.667 --> 28:04.041
but he, he was so charmed and was so happy,

28:04.250 --> 28:08.375
and after such a long time I saw that joy in his eyes.

28:08.625 --> 28:13.917
"Oh God! So what he wanted, we gave him."

28:20.000 --> 28:24.667
It's such a, after all, you see, what is there after all?

28:24.999 --> 28:28.417
What is the use of all these riches, these (inaudible) and things?

28:28.709 --> 28:32.667
What do we get? Nothing, no joy, nothing.

28:34.750 --> 28:37.500
First of all we think we are husband and wife,

28:37.750 --> 28:40.417
then to quarrel all the time, all right.

28:40.750 --> 28:42.792
I don't think there is much love also there.

28:42.999 --> 28:43.959
I don't know about Sahaja Yogis,

28:44.125 --> 28:47.375
but otherwise, I don't know about Sahaja Yogis also.

28:48.041 --> 28:51.625
Then that quarreling is over. Then "my child, my children."

28:51.834 --> 28:55.458
Then they also quarrel, they also fight, they also run away.

28:55.709 --> 28:58.583
By the age they are sixteen they are thinking

28:58.792 --> 29:02.500
where they are going to run away. Why do they run away?

29:08.959 --> 29:12.999
But our children stick like leeches.

29:13.583 --> 29:18.000
We have never made them like that but still they stick.

29:22.999 --> 29:24.917
Why?

29:25.208 --> 29:27.917
They are not ego-oriented.

29:28.166 --> 29:31.583
Because you are separated. You are a different identity.

29:31.792 --> 29:34.750
"I. I like this. I like that."

29:34.999 --> 29:36.583
I mean, it's a sin to say like that.

29:36.792 --> 29:40.250
Who are you to say, "I like"? "I" means what?

29:45.041 --> 29:47.250
So all these things we have to change and we have to understand.

29:47.458 --> 29:52.417
Only possibility is in ashram life.

29:53.583 --> 29:56.000
How you respect, how you live,

29:56.250 --> 29:58.583
how you greet each and every person,

29:58.792 --> 30:01.333
how you behave:

30:02.291 --> 30:04.375
this is a culture we have to imbibe.

30:04.583 --> 30:09.125
If we have to give our children a very good time we have to imbibe.

30:12.291 --> 30:14.667
I wouldn't say that in India we don't have funny people.

30:14.875 --> 30:18.250
We have people of loose characters, we have all kinds of things.

30:18.542 --> 30:21.458
But the number is so little that they do not influence.

30:21.667 --> 30:24.250
Here, the number is of the others are more than these.

30:24.500 --> 30:25.709
So they influence too much.

30:25.917 --> 30:28.709
Everybody is putting their hair like this now.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.542
So you don't have your hair, you'll also feel like putting your hair like this.

30:37.417 --> 30:38.917
It's a, it's, I don't know why,

30:39.083 --> 30:42.542
and also this is a false idea

30:42.750 --> 30:45.542
that we should have our hair very disheveled.

30:45.792 --> 30:47.792
You see, I being this Goddess business

30:48.041 --> 30:50.875
I have to keep My hair open,

30:51.166 --> 30:54.792
but I keep them all right. They are not disheveled.

30:55.166 --> 30:58.291
I have to keep Mine because you know, Muktakeshi

30:58.667 --> 31:01.250
- keep Her hair open because of vibrations to flow.

31:01.583 --> 31:06.500
But I never, you would never find My hair jumbled up like that.

31:08.375 --> 31:10.500
Because then the bhoots catch you.

31:10.792 --> 31:12.959
They see, "This is the head. Oh, good one!

31:16.208 --> 31:18.959
It's is a jumbled head. Get into it!"

31:19.750 --> 31:22.917
Bhoots catch you much more in modern times than they used to catch

31:23.083 --> 31:25.542
because we live like bhoots.

31:25.917 --> 31:28.709
You know, on the street you go and find so many women, men

31:28.959 --> 31:31.709
dressed up just like bhoots. So bhoots can go. "This is the bhoot!"

31:31.917 --> 31:34.834
Why not they catch in India so many bhoots?

31:35.208 --> 31:36.999
Once somebody gets his realization,

31:37.208 --> 31:41.000
I have not met many those who catch bhoots.

31:43.583 --> 31:44.959
Because we dress up like that,

31:45.125 --> 31:47.999
we are ego-oriented, so the bhoots come in.

31:48.625 --> 31:51.125
I am not saying you should go to hairdressers and all that,

31:51.375 --> 31:55.583
but one should not have a face or a hair like a bhoot.

31:56.208 --> 32:00.041
Now if you want how a bhoot looks like, I will show you also.

32:03.834 --> 32:05.917
So this is what one has to understand

32:06.125 --> 32:08.917
that there is something missing in our upbringing,

32:09.083 --> 32:11.750
which we have to change, and the change has to be

32:11.999 --> 32:14.750
that to make a good family, to have good children,

32:15.000 --> 32:19.500
we have to have certain ideas whom to respect,

32:19.709 --> 32:22.792
how to respect, how to understand.

32:26.250 --> 32:31.959
I mean, like Gupta got angry with Dr. Talwar.

32:33.500 --> 32:37.291
So I told him, "You go and touch his feet." Immediately he did it.

32:38.333 --> 32:39.875
"He is elder than you, and you have no business to get angry.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.834
Go and touch his feet." Immediately he did, and he said,

32:43.000 --> 32:45.959
"See now, he provoked me, Mother, and I have got the bad name."

32:46.166 --> 32:47.959
I said, "You go and touch his feet," he touched his feet

32:48.125 --> 32:51.208
immediately, no question.

32:53.917 --> 32:56.333
Anybody answers anybody

32:56.625 --> 33:00.166
- a child, a younger person answers to anyone else -

33:00.875 --> 33:03.999
the father, mother will all the time, "Go and fall at his feet.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.208
Come along. Nothing doing."

33:06.500 --> 33:09.750
That's how they learn respect.

33:13.875 --> 33:16.999
You are very good seekers. You are seeking the truth and all that

33:17.208 --> 33:19.667
but with that, to bear that truth,

33:19.917 --> 33:24.166
we have to have a kind of a culture that you can bear it.

33:24.583 --> 33:28.625
Otherwise, this ego will always shoot out, right side.

33:29.208 --> 33:33.000
The right side is the problem of the West. This you agree?

33:33.208 --> 33:34.792
[Sahaja Yogis: Yes, Shri Mataji.]

33:35.000 --> 33:37.333
But you will find this with your leaders, not with yourself.

33:37.542 --> 33:39.166
This is the problem.

33:39.417 --> 33:41.208
The one who has the authority to assert,

33:41.417 --> 33:43.166
you will find it with him, not with yourself,

33:43.417 --> 33:46.458
that you have this problem, isn't it true?

33:52.959 --> 33:56.875
The wives of leaders also should know they are the mothers

33:57.083 --> 34:00.667
and they have to have an extremely sweet and a humble nature

34:01.000 --> 34:03.542
and they should tolerate lot of nonsense;

34:03.792 --> 34:07.625
not only that, but always try to soothe their husbands.

34:07.999 --> 34:11.208
I'll tell you, in My husband's office in Shipping Corporation

34:11.458 --> 34:15.458
all the people there depended on Me. If anything goes wrong,

34:15.667 --> 34:18.166
if C.P. is angry with them, they'll come and tell Me.

34:18.417 --> 34:21.583
Then I would slowly tell him, "Why should you be so angry with them?

34:21.792 --> 34:24.083
After all, you see, they are humans beings and they have done-"

34:24.375 --> 34:27.250
"Oh! So they come to you?" "Yes, they did."

34:30.041 --> 34:31.500
Then I would tell him, I would tell him,

34:31.709 --> 34:33.500
"Because they think I am more generous than you are."

34:33.709 --> 34:38.458
"All right, I am also more generous." Then he would be doing.

34:39.999 --> 34:43.834
So she should not think she is a leader - no, never.

34:44.041 --> 34:46.083
She should think, "I am the mother of all these,"

34:46.291 --> 34:48.959
now she should see the people who have come here:

34:49.125 --> 34:52.291
have they got food or not? Have they been attended to or not?

34:52.542 --> 34:56.583
These are guests, and guests are to be treated like gods.

34:57.083 --> 35:03.500
And the trouble here is that everybody walks into your house like a guest,

35:03.834 --> 35:05.875
or stays with you like a guest, you see, like -

35:06.041 --> 35:08.709
you will be surprised, I had a house in Hounslow.

35:08.917 --> 35:11.792
So many Sahaja Yogis stayed there, never paid a single pie.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.917
I had to pay for electricity, gas, everything.

35:15.166 --> 35:17.375
From the very beginning since I have been in London,

35:17.583 --> 35:18.999
I have been paying for all that.

35:19.208 --> 35:21.375
Even Shudy Camp, most of the money I have paid,

35:21.583 --> 35:24.041
but there were twenty-five people living there when I went,

35:24.250 --> 35:27.834
not paying a single penny for anything.

35:28.250 --> 35:31.542
But Indian won't do that

35:34.291 --> 35:37.875
because of self-respect.

35:41.667 --> 35:42.917
Now I am telling Mathias,

35:43.125 --> 35:44.999
"I have used your telephone this time many a times,"

35:45.208 --> 35:46.333
and he has to take the money.

35:46.542 --> 35:49.667
If he doesn't take money I won't be able to sleep.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.792
So, use somebody's telephone as much as you like,

35:56.000 --> 35:57.834
use anybody's things as much as you like,

35:58.000 --> 35:59.792
stay there in their house so carelessly.

35:59.999 --> 36:03.041
It's so common in the West. I never knew.

36:03.250 --> 36:05.750
I used to think, "They are very upright people.

36:05.959 --> 36:08.959
They will never come to your house like that."

36:09.417 --> 36:14.500
Gregoire will tell you the whole story about it if you want to hear.

36:17.792 --> 36:21.000
So now this ashram where you are living,

36:21.208 --> 36:23.792
even if you are coming from outside, you are Sahaja Yogis.

36:23.999 --> 36:26.500
You find something dirty, try to clean it.

36:26.709 --> 36:28.750
This is your house.

36:28.959 --> 36:32.250
So it has become like nobody's house now.

36:33.917 --> 36:35.417
Actually, it is everybody's house.

36:35.625 --> 36:38.917
Recently it has become nobody's house.

36:40.709 --> 36:43.750
So, not to feel bad, not to feel upset, not to feel

36:44.000 --> 36:47.959
that I am in any way trying to put you down, but I must tell you that

36:48.125 --> 36:52.542
this will develop your children's ego and your ego, too.

36:53.875 --> 36:56.166
To live together, enjoy together,

36:56.375 --> 37:00.333
we have to have certain type of culture

37:01.041 --> 37:04.750
which is not in the West. West are very individualistic,

37:05.250 --> 37:09.875
extremely individualistic people, and they have this problem

37:10.166 --> 37:12.250
and they have suffered because of that.

37:12.542 --> 37:15.917
We want to create a new world of people

37:16.166 --> 37:18.999
who love each other, who will enjoy each other

37:19.166 --> 37:22.250
and who understand each other; not only that,

37:22.500 --> 37:27.500
but those who have collective consciousness manifested in their own lives.

37:28.875 --> 37:30.792
And also to tell somebody, "You are a bhoot,

37:31.083 --> 37:32.999
you're caught up like this," it's not proper.

37:33.208 --> 37:37.333
That shows you have no understanding how to deal with people.

37:37.625 --> 37:39.959
Never say, "You have a bhoot," or anything.

37:40.208 --> 37:43.166
At the most you can say "this chakra is catching," if it is needed,

37:43.375 --> 37:46.834
but there is no need to tell that.

37:48.999 --> 37:52.917
Is, as we, you see, as we say that

37:53.166 --> 37:56.375
"If you become the king you have to wear the crown".

37:56.709 --> 38:00.750
So if you become a Sahaja Yogi you have to wear this culture.

38:02.375 --> 38:06.834
You cannot be like bhoots, cannot be.

38:07.208 --> 38:09.166
Not that you have to be something different

38:09.375 --> 38:11.834
like Hare Rama, Hare Krishna. I am not saying this,

38:12.083 --> 38:16.166
but you have to be something special.

38:17.625 --> 38:22.291
And the speciality doesn't come by becoming punks or anything.

38:22.999 --> 38:26.458
Punks think they are very special people

38:27.041 --> 38:30.625
by making that kind of a hairstyle.

38:31.125 --> 38:35.333
Speciality is within yourself. It's a kind of a culture.

38:35.667 --> 38:38.834
So first of all, look after your ego.

38:39.083 --> 38:41.959
Soul-searching has to be there.

38:42.125 --> 38:45.709
Because when I read Russian people, their books,

38:45.917 --> 38:49.999
I found out that every book, whether they describe romance,

38:50.166 --> 38:51.834
they describe anything,

38:52.083 --> 38:54.959
there is behind, is all soul-searching.

38:55.208 --> 38:58.208
They are trying to find out, "Why I am doing this? Why I am doing that?

38:58.500 --> 39:00.625
Why am I like this?" Soul-searching is there.

39:00.875 --> 39:03.000
So we should search our souls.

39:03.250 --> 39:05.417
So all the time say, "Why am I doing this?

39:05.667 --> 39:08.375
Why am I like this?  What is the reason?"

39:08.583 --> 39:12.834
This is what has to be done. Then this ego will drop out.

39:14.375 --> 39:20.000
It's a funny thing because it's already grown so big, you see.

39:20.250 --> 39:23.291
So you push it down, it comes back up like a rubber,

39:23.500 --> 39:28.083
push it down, again with the slightest thing it comes up.

39:30.083 --> 39:34.125
Arrogance,  talking loudly and misbehaving,

39:34.333 --> 39:37.625
all that, right Vishuddhi catches so badly.

39:40.625 --> 39:41.125
All right?

39:41.333 --> 39:45.750
So now it is not in any way to correct you but to guide you.

39:45.999 --> 39:49.208
And not to feel bad and Center Heart or something catching there,

39:49.500 --> 39:52.959
nothing of the kind. It should, it should catch nowhere

39:53.166 --> 39:57.583
but it should correct you in the normal way.

39:58.208 --> 40:00.999
Now the problem of Indians are different

40:01.208 --> 40:04.291
and I, when I deal with them, I talk to them.

40:04.500 --> 40:08.500
But at least they do not have cultural problem;

40:14.583 --> 40:16.375
that's one thing.

40:16.667 --> 40:19.291
Of course, I mean, if they come from stupid families,

40:19.542 --> 40:22.208
if they have come with nonsensical things, then it's all right.

40:22.625 --> 40:25.709
Normally ninety-nine percent, one percent could be bad, also,

40:26.083 --> 40:28.834
I am not saying they are not bad.

40:32.000 --> 40:37.583
And everybody must work - not that three, four people are working.

40:40.709 --> 40:43.750
You must learn every day. You can learn so many things,

40:44.041 --> 40:47.417
and you are seekers. Not only that, but you are Sahaja Yogis.

40:47.667 --> 40:53.000
You have so much of dynamism. You can do such a lot.

40:55.750 --> 40:58.792
So any idea about yourself - you are so great or something -

40:58.999 --> 41:01.125
should be given up because we are Sahaja Yogis.

41:01.333 --> 41:06.208
So we are already great. Those who are great are already great.

41:06.709 --> 41:08.583
I mean, supposing somebody says You are Adi Shakti.

41:08.792 --> 41:12.959
Now, I don't think it's something great because I am that. So what?

41:13.250 --> 41:17.583
If I was not that I would have felt, but I am Adi Shakti. So what?

41:17.875 --> 41:19.999
If I am Adi Shakti why should I feel proud of it?

41:20.250 --> 41:23.999
Because it is just there. What to do?

41:29.083 --> 41:31.792
And whenever you are saying, "Jai" and all that,

41:31.999 --> 41:33.792
I feel you are saying somebody else's "Jai".

41:34.000 --> 41:36.417
Sometimes I am afraid I might start saying with you.

41:42.625 --> 41:43.583
It never goes into My head,

41:43.792 --> 41:45.458
and you know, I don't know how it goes into your head.

41:45.709 --> 41:49.417
I said perhaps the hole is too big, so nothing stays.

41:49.750 --> 41:51.875
But you see, that's what I am saying.

41:52.041 --> 41:55.417
Now for you, if I am the model and if you understand Me,

41:55.625 --> 41:58.750
then you must understand My culture.

41:59.166 --> 42:03.917
How, like Mathias was surprised that

42:04.166 --> 42:07.333
they were putting some balm on My feet or something on My feet, and I said,

42:07.583 --> 42:12.959
"Now, put some towel because I don't want this sheet to be spoilt."

42:13.291 --> 42:16.166
I mean, this is very, nothing great to Me but he felt

42:16.375 --> 42:19.667
that I was extremely - what, humble or what.

42:19.875 --> 42:21.792
But what is there? A sheet will be spoiled in any case,

42:21.999 --> 42:25.250
whether they are My feet or anybody's feet.

42:26.125 --> 42:29.125
That's how it should be.

42:29.834 --> 42:32.208
So culturally, though I mean,

42:32.458 --> 42:37.041
we are very rich, I have never realized how rich Indians are.

42:38.041 --> 42:39.000
Now I am realizing.

42:39.208 --> 42:40.875
Now supposing somebody is leaving.

42:41.041 --> 42:44.250
A little pencil is left - so little, you see - in the house,

42:44.542 --> 42:45.999
but that belongs to somebody.

42:46.208 --> 42:49.542
That will be kept like a precious stone, you know.

42:49.792 --> 42:53.166
Till you meet that person and give that,

42:53.542 --> 42:55.999
everybody'll say, "Have you given that? Have you given that or not?"

42:56.166 --> 42:59.875
"Baba, that person has not come as yet. He's gone somewhere."

43:00.083 --> 43:02.834
As soon as he'll come, first thing we'll go with that pencil

43:03.000 --> 43:05.333
and he'll say, "What? This pencil you've brought for me?"

43:05.542 --> 43:08.999
He will feel so bad about it, but no, the pencil belongs to him, all right,

43:09.208 --> 43:12.291
keep it like a precious stone.

43:15.750 --> 43:20.125
I mean, they are poor people compared to you.

43:22.583 --> 43:25.041
Even the servants don't do any thieving, nothing.

43:25.333 --> 43:27.291
These politicians must have picked up from somewhere.

43:27.500 --> 43:31.709
I don't know from where they, must be from Warren Hastings.

43:31.999 --> 43:33.834
But normally there is no thieving in the house.

43:34.000 --> 43:38.375
Everything is left open. Everything is there, no thieving.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.625
Government is corrupt

43:45.959 --> 43:48.834
- there's all horrible things are corrupt, that's there -

43:49.125 --> 43:53.625
but as far as the society is concerned, we are very honest.

44:00.875 --> 44:02.875
I wish "Sarat Chandra" was translated for you

44:03.041 --> 44:06.250
to understand this beauty of this culture.

44:08.834 --> 44:13.291
Lot of such good points of this culture.

44:13.542 --> 44:17.542
We had that, you have that thing of Shrikanth,

44:17.750 --> 44:19.709
film of "Shrikanth"?

44:20.041 --> 44:21.208
[Sahaja Yogi: I am not sure, Shri Mataji...]

44:21.458 --> 44:24.125
English are coming. Ask them to bring it.

44:24.333 --> 44:27.208
It's one of the best films you will see.

44:30.250 --> 44:32.667
[Another Sahaja Yogi: They are
already at the airport, Shri Mataji.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.250
They are already at the airport, Shri Mataji. The English, are arriving.]

44:37.583 --> 44:38.750
All right, next time.

44:38.959 --> 44:40.041
[Sahaja Yogi: They are coming over here].

44:40.250 --> 44:41.709
[Sahaja Yogi: Diwali, Diwali.]

44:46.250 --> 44:47.083
[Sahaja Yogi: Thank you, Shri Mataji.]

44:47.291 --> 44:48.792
May God bless you all.
