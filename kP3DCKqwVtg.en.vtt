00:00:00.063 --> 00:00:03.357
Talk before award in Turkey at Diwali Puja

00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:15.967
After two minutes,

00:00:16.703 --> 00:00:19.630
professor Voronov is here

00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:23.862
and he wants to give Me some special award

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.448
from St Petersburg University.

00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:32.262
So, I will request you all to be sitted,

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:38.335
it will take hardly ten minues
 for the whole thing.

00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:44.774
So, before that, I must say the

00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:48.775
weddings went off very well despite the fact

00:00:48.827 --> 00:00:52.374
it’s Turkey and it’s very different

00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:57.825
from India where you can get everything very easily.

00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:02.363
And you all are looking very happy.

00:01:02.388 --> 00:01:06.924
Keep this joy all the time

00:01:06.998 --> 00:01:10.626
and be kind and gentle with each other.

00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:13.575
As I’ve said you have to soothe others.

00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:19.141
You have to take up the problems of each other

00:01:19.296 --> 00:01:23.392
and don’t discuss your past,
don’t talk about your past.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:26.468
That’s one thing very wrong,

00:01:26.493 --> 00:01:30.622
that makes life unnecessarily miserable.

00:01:30.647 --> 00:01:37.494
Past is over and, now,
the reality starts.

00:01:37.807 --> 00:01:42.973
Enjoy each other’s company,
 try to find good points of

00:01:44.662 --> 00:01:46.646
another person.

00:01:47.003 --> 00:01:50.474
If you want to find bad points

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:54.384
that’s not going to give you any joy,
 it’s not going to help you.

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.441
But if you start finding
the good points of another person,

00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:03.584
that not only that you will be very happy,

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:07.761
but also you’ll imbibe those good points.

00:02:08.282 --> 00:02:12.545
Always try to see each other’s good points,

00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:16.573
never criticize each other for small things,

00:02:16.598 --> 00:02:19.980
for petty things.
We are Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:22.869
We are saints, we are angels,

00:02:22.894 --> 00:02:27.348
we cannot be like ordinary
stupid people who fight

00:02:27.373 --> 00:02:30.034
and create problems in their life.

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:33.330
We are here to make each other happy

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.500
and to make everyone happy;

00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:39.860
all the Sahaja Yogis to be happy.

00:02:39.885 --> 00:02:42.204
The whole society of Sahaja Yoga

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:45.453
 should be of a very different type.

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.631
And there are so many children
who are Realized souls,

00:02:49.656 --> 00:02:53.515
who are great saints,
seers, who want to be born

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.193
and they’ll be only born to Sahaja Yogis who are

00:02:59.977 --> 00:03:05.417
Sahaj by temperament

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.947
and who are peaceful,

00:03:08.972 --> 00:03:12.633
who try to seek peace everywhere,

00:03:12.903 --> 00:03:15.931
and who are very large hearted.

00:03:15.956 --> 00:03:19.904
All such people will have very great children.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.022
May God bless you all.
