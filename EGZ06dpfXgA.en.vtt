00:04.741 --> 00:10.155
“Detachment is the only way you can rise.”

00:17.523 --> 00:23.507
In Sahaja Yoga we have never tried

00:23.708 --> 00:30.007
to overcome the desires by taking sanyasa
or running away from the house

00:30.208 --> 00:34.766
or for all kinds of things that has been
suggested.

00:34.967 --> 00:42.240
The first thing that is done is that you
get the light of your spirit.

00:42.441 --> 00:46.593
Spirit is the reflection of Sadashiva.

00:46.794 --> 00:50.555
In that light He shows, He is just showing
the path.

00:50.756 --> 00:59.727
The spirit is just like a light which is
burning and which is showing the path.

01:00.802 --> 01:06.804
In that path you yourself become so wise

01:07.005 --> 01:15.789
that you walk in the light of wisdom, that
you walk in the light of righteousness.

01:15.990 --> 01:22.742
Because whatever is destructive is seen
through the light of your spirit.

01:22.943 --> 01:26.859
You start giving up all that is destructive.

01:27.942 --> 01:31.898
Nobody has to tell you that give up this,
give up that.

01:32.099 --> 01:37.727
You yourself realize that this is wrong and
we should give up.

01:38.177 --> 01:46.711
This was, I should say, my own understanding
of human beings

01:46.912 --> 01:54.539
because these are the days where people
are in complete illusions.

01:54.740 --> 01:59.992
They are in a conflict all the time
struggling even to exist.

02:00.208 --> 02:04.523
Under these circumstances, everything would
have failed

02:04.724 --> 02:11.492
if you had started with taking a sanyasa
and then going to Himalayas and all that.

02:11.693 --> 02:18.570
If you have to do this for the masses,
something has to be done radical

02:18.771 --> 02:22.992
and luckily I’ve been able to find out
a way

02:23.170 --> 02:32.415
by which you can get your sprouting,
your Realization.

02:32.616 --> 02:39.001
Now some people who get Realization have
to understand certain things

02:39.202 --> 02:45.627
because as you know there are many people
who have got Realization.

02:45.828 --> 02:49.540
I don’t know how many, I don’t keep count.

02:49.741 --> 02:55.830
But what is lacking in them is
surrendering.

02:58.694 --> 03:02.806
It’s embarrassing to say but is a fact.

03:02.968 --> 03:09.056
This is the only condition of modern
Sahaja Yoga

03:09.257 --> 03:12.548
that you have to really surrender.

03:12.749 --> 03:18.986
If you start using your brain, if you start
using other methods

03:19.163 --> 03:24.953
to understand Sahaja Yoga, you cannot.
You must surrender

03:25.154 --> 03:31.712
and as Islam is nothing but surrender,
Islam means surrender.

03:32.468 --> 03:38.267
And if that surrender is not there

03:38.772 --> 03:47.645
it is impossible to establish anyone
in the Kingdom of God.

03:50.962 --> 04:01.051
Surrender is not that you should give up
your family, give up your children,

04:01.252 --> 04:06.660
or give up your houses and homes and your
properties.

04:06.861 --> 04:11.988
Surrendering is here: give up your ego
to begin with

04:12.189 --> 04:14.895
and then give up your conditionings.

04:15.759 --> 04:23.808
But first thing as I said, is surrendering.
In surrendering actually

04:24.143 --> 04:29.760
you develop a kind of a state where
I would say

04:30.585 --> 04:37.643
you become a sanyasi, from within.

04:38.444 --> 04:41.283
That means nothing can dominate you,

04:41.484 --> 04:47.916
what is a sanyasi is a person who is above
everything else.

04:48.117 --> 04:51.666
Nothing can stick to him.

04:52.163 --> 04:58.235
He just looks at things and he knows what
it is.

04:58.436 --> 05:05.095
He may not say, he knows everything and
he doesn’t do whatever is wrong.

05:05.296 --> 05:11.885
He’s so detached, that in that detachment
only he can see what’s wrong with him.

05:12.086 --> 05:16.877
He starts seeing his family people, he
starts seeing other surroundings,

05:17.078 --> 05:21.557
everywhere he starts seeing what’s wrong.

05:21.734 --> 05:25.455
And he does not identify with them, is very
surprising.

05:26.226 --> 05:30.166
It’s, you see, it is so clear-cut that
this light

05:30.367 --> 05:35.939
definitely gives you tremendous wisdom
and balance.

05:36.140 --> 05:42.064
Supposing you are walking and you can’t see
the road, you may fall down.

05:42.265 --> 05:44.728
But if there’s little light also you can
see it.

05:44.929 --> 05:50.314
And this is what Sahaja Yoga has done,
is given you very little light.

05:50.491 --> 05:55.197
That little light itself has been sufficient
for you to give up so many things.

05:55.617 --> 06:00.533
So when we talk of ascent, we talk of
a higher life.

06:00.733 --> 06:07.963
We have to become sanyasi like the lotus
that comes out of the pond

06:08.164 --> 06:12.701
and no water can stay on them.

06:13.120 --> 06:19.138
Even the leaves of lotus, no water can stay
on them. Just like that we have to become.

06:19.339 --> 06:23.435
We don’t have to wear sanyasis dresses,
nothing of that.

06:23.636 --> 06:30.357
But from inside, a kind of a detached
attention is there

06:30.558 --> 06:38.029
which immediately locates the problem,
within you and without.

06:38.230 --> 06:44.076
And also in Sahaja Yoga, you know how
to overcome that.

06:44.277 --> 06:53.638
It’s a very effective, efficient system.

06:54.018 --> 07:03.541
But for that again, to achieve that you have
to become Shiva within, means detached.

07:03.742 --> 07:08.828
As Shiva is completely detached, you have
to be detached.

07:09.051 --> 07:14.647
And that detachment will give you the same
wisdom as Shiva has.

07:16.131 --> 07:20.000
So this is His, the quality one has
to understand,

07:20.201 --> 07:23.857
surrendering doesn’t mean outside things
to be surrendered.

07:24.058 --> 07:28.443
What is there, these are all stones, what
are you surrendering?

07:29.824 --> 07:38.112
Surrendering means cleansing yourself
completely, getting completely detached.

07:38.313 --> 07:43.003
Detachment is the only way you can rise.

07:56.992 --> 08:00.386
Some people get sick, they make such
an ado out of it:

08:00.587 --> 08:06.011
“I am sick, the whole world should know
I am sick, sick, sick, sick, sick.”

08:06.212 --> 08:10.582
But if you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you
just watch:

08:10.783 --> 08:14.894
“Oh so, I am sick, all right, let’s see.”

08:15.300 --> 08:20.124
Just like a sport. Just watch.

08:21.059 --> 08:25.960
I am sick. So, what’s happening now?
The temperature is coming nicely,

08:26.161 --> 08:30.934
now is going down, is just sort of a

08:33.270 --> 08:36.397
playful, mirthful attention.

08:37.187 --> 08:42.260
So the first thing of surrendering is
important

08:42.461 --> 08:47.533
to reach the state of your Spirit, of Shiva
and Sadashiva.

08:47.734 --> 08:55.658
But the second state is that you have to
now think of others.

08:55.859 --> 09:02.963
First it is as they say in Sanskrit is
vyashti, means individual gain,

09:03.164 --> 09:11.782
you get the individual gain. And then it
becomes samashti, means the collective.

09:11.983 --> 09:15.959
You have to work it out on collective.

09:16.394 --> 09:19.670
People who never even got Realization,

09:19.871 --> 09:24.694
nothing of the kind, have been doing
so much organization and this and that.

09:24.895 --> 09:29.303
While you have got it within you, so now
it is important

09:29.504 --> 09:35.145
that you should now extend this light
to others.
