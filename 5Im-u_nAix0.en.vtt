00:10.930 --> 00:17.289
[Music]

00:33.040 --> 00:39.680
you see if you if you try your own self

00:37.309 --> 00:41.900
you see trying with Kundalini actually

00:39.680 --> 00:43.900
sympathetic goals interactivity you have

00:41.900 --> 00:45.890
no right on the parasympathetic

00:43.900 --> 00:47.870
parasympathetic is the one which

00:45.890 --> 00:49.760
balances and that is the central path of

00:47.870 --> 00:52.280
sushumna through which the Kundalini has

00:49.760 --> 00:54.489
to rise but if you try anything what you

00:52.280 --> 00:57.260
do is always you can use sympathetic

00:54.489 --> 00:59.239
I'll give an example supposing you are

00:57.260 --> 01:02.420
running fast all right then you can

00:59.239 --> 01:04.130
raise the rate of your heart but you

01:02.420 --> 01:05.810
cannot slow it down it slows down light

01:04.130 --> 01:08.210
itself that is parasympathetic activity

01:05.810 --> 01:10.430
so you just get into sympathetic

01:08.210 --> 01:11.570
activity and by sympathetic activity if

01:10.430 --> 01:14.840
you overdo it

01:11.570 --> 01:17.660
then all these symptoms happens and it's

01:14.840 --> 01:19.610
not that on the contrary chakras go into

01:17.660 --> 01:21.979
quite like this is our left and the

01:19.610 --> 01:23.930
right sympathetic and these are the

01:21.979 --> 01:26.150
centres they get pulled down right and

01:23.930 --> 01:31.310
if they are full like this then you are

01:26.150 --> 01:35.350
harmed so it is it is not an experience

01:31.310 --> 01:35.350
of Kundalini but is of the sentiment

01:42.390 --> 01:45.629
[Music]

01:55.280 --> 02:01.440
no it doesn't go down Kundalini ver goes

01:58.110 --> 02:03.000
down it goes upward always the thing

02:01.440 --> 02:05.460
that comes down is the crease you see

02:03.000 --> 02:08.790
the grace comes down not definitely

02:05.460 --> 02:11.220
Kundalini all always goes upwards and

02:08.790 --> 02:13.290
the grace comes on your sympathetic

02:11.220 --> 02:15.660
which calms you down completely you

02:13.290 --> 02:18.660
become absolutely relaxed beautiful but

02:15.660 --> 02:23.400
the Kundalini itself always goes up it

02:18.660 --> 02:25.260
never comes down but in people it so

02:23.400 --> 02:27.930
happens that Kundalini goes through this

02:25.260 --> 02:31.950
central path now if it is sort of very

02:27.930 --> 02:34.560
much rugged or if it is extremely smooth

02:31.950 --> 02:37.020
due to the mistakes of the Seekers then

02:34.560 --> 02:39.720
it falls down it falls down is a

02:37.020 --> 02:41.100
different point than going like that if

02:39.720 --> 02:43.290
first off then you have to raise it

02:41.100 --> 02:45.269
again and try them again raise it and

02:43.290 --> 02:49.830
title in many people it has to be done

02:45.269 --> 02:51.630
but it can work you will get the

02:49.830 --> 02:53.400
complete knowledge don't you worry now

02:51.630 --> 02:55.980
he has been as you said 18 months but

02:53.400 --> 02:57.480
he's a master of kundunese he can raise

02:55.980 --> 03:00.209
your Kundalini and you are just like him

02:57.480 --> 03:02.840
you will become the same there's no no

03:00.209 --> 03:02.840
problem at all

03:11.940 --> 03:16.320
does having a vertebra out of place in

03:14.190 --> 03:18.860
the spine interfere with the rising of

03:16.320 --> 03:21.990
Kundalini it does to some extent it does

03:18.860 --> 03:23.580
definitely does but we can put a try the

03:21.990 --> 03:25.410
vertebra can be put right and the

03:23.580 --> 03:28.170
Kundalini can be brought in it does so

03:25.410 --> 03:30.390
many things do happen if you have but

03:28.170 --> 03:32.070
you are a person over read if you are

03:30.390 --> 03:35.990
read too many books and the books are in

03:32.070 --> 03:35.990
your head I have to empty that holes I

03:38.000 --> 03:44.430
actually do this work as a profession

03:40.650 --> 03:47.850
and I find that if the subtle center is

03:44.430 --> 03:50.280
fixed the spinal problems just disappear

03:47.850 --> 03:52.740
I used to have three and four

03:50.280 --> 03:55.860
adjustments a week to correct my spine

03:52.740 --> 03:58.860
and now I have none at all so first fix

03:55.860 --> 04:01.140
the subtle within us and then the gross

03:58.860 --> 04:03.830
part the spinal misalignments and so on

04:01.140 --> 04:03.830
we'll just get better

04:06.980 --> 04:10.130
[Music]

04:13.180 --> 04:19.030
what is the first step to

04:15.129 --> 04:22.539
self-realization there is nothing like

04:19.030 --> 04:25.000
first second it's not a course see the

04:22.539 --> 04:28.120
Kundalini it's an awakening within us

04:25.000 --> 04:31.210
which takes place which is like a living

04:28.120 --> 04:35.949
process all right so the Kundalini rises

04:31.210 --> 04:38.710
and shoots off here now some people feel

04:35.949 --> 04:41.490
the Kundalini wobbling down there down

04:38.710 --> 04:44.500
below some people feel it in this town

04:41.490 --> 04:47.260
some people feel it here some people

04:44.500 --> 04:50.199
feel it here but most of them feel it we

04:47.260 --> 04:52.780
are only jutting out like race so you

04:50.199 --> 04:58.090
just can't say what is the first step

04:52.780 --> 05:00.340
depends on how it rises so everybody

04:58.090 --> 05:04.410
doesn't feel the same way so I can't say

05:00.340 --> 05:04.410
that this is the first thing all right

05:04.710 --> 05:10.300
of course first you feel thoughtlessly

05:08.020 --> 05:12.280
aware you become thoughtlessly aware

05:10.300 --> 05:14.560
first thing that should happen to you

05:12.280 --> 05:16.690
when the kundalini crosses this Center

05:14.560 --> 05:18.610
when it comes out of it you start

05:16.690 --> 05:20.380
feeling the cool breeze here and you

05:18.610 --> 05:22.180
start feeling the cool breeze in your

05:20.380 --> 05:24.910
hands and you start feeling the cool

05:22.180 --> 05:28.080
breeze around that's the second stage

05:24.910 --> 05:28.080
where it can go

05:32.450 --> 05:39.470
can anyone be realized without knowing

05:35.180 --> 05:42.410
about Kundalini about mentally need not

05:39.470 --> 05:44.690
know what can be realized of course you

05:42.410 --> 05:47.420
can't be but then you have to tell them

05:44.690 --> 05:49.430
what it is this thing is better to do

05:47.420 --> 05:51.740
that way but there will be very few who

05:49.430 --> 05:54.590
will accept such a situation because

05:51.740 --> 05:56.090
they want to know about everything but

05:54.590 --> 05:58.910
they need not know all that you can

05:56.090 --> 06:02.000
little bit say tell them that there is a

05:58.910 --> 06:04.040
way of getting realization and then it's

06:02.000 --> 06:05.570
like this that even you come to me you

06:04.040 --> 06:07.760
want to have the lights I'll say all

06:05.570 --> 06:10.100
right go there's a switch you put on and

06:07.760 --> 06:11.840
you put on the switch you get the lights

06:10.100 --> 06:13.490
without telling about it but you would

06:11.840 --> 06:17.210
like to know how this light is turned

06:13.490 --> 06:19.820
and then that helps you to create other

06:17.210 --> 06:22.520
lights that's why it is important to

06:19.820 --> 06:24.080
know about Kundalini I would I can do it

06:22.520 --> 06:26.300
without telling you anything about

06:24.080 --> 06:27.770
Kundalini I can raise your Kundalini but

06:26.300 --> 06:29.840
you would not know anything about and

06:27.770 --> 06:31.970
you would not know what it is it has

06:29.840 --> 06:33.530
happened with many who were born

06:31.970 --> 06:35.990
realized they did not know they were

06:33.530 --> 06:37.820
realized Souls and they got lost like I

06:35.990 --> 06:41.030
would say greatest example here not on

06:37.820 --> 06:43.550
the windshield you're not at the wind

06:41.030 --> 06:45.500
she was a realized soul and he got lost

06:43.550 --> 06:47.510
because he didn't know he was a realized

06:45.500 --> 06:49.430
soul he was a higher personality than

06:47.510 --> 06:51.820
others he got lost so many what lost

06:49.430 --> 06:51.820
like that

06:59.000 --> 07:05.250
how can you be lost if the kundalini has

07:01.530 --> 07:08.760
been awakened latest because you see it

07:05.250 --> 07:11.010
is you are not yet fully developed

07:08.760 --> 07:13.170
mature person when you are in an image

07:11.010 --> 07:15.420
or stretch it does happen Kundalini is

07:13.170 --> 07:17.490
when it rises should be surprised in

07:15.420 --> 07:19.380
some people it is just a wee bit just

07:17.490 --> 07:21.240
like a hair just comes up a little

07:19.380 --> 07:23.370
because so difficult to see you the

07:21.240 --> 07:25.800
passage is so block so a little bit

07:23.370 --> 07:27.870
comes up this is what it is it is a

07:25.800 --> 07:29.640
complete realization takes place only

07:27.870 --> 07:31.140
when you are near to be culpa Samadhi

07:29.640 --> 07:33.120
that's the higher state so in the

07:31.140 --> 07:36.480
beginning it just little bit opens up

07:33.120 --> 07:38.310
and one person people do get lost they

07:36.480 --> 07:40.530
do because they have egos they have

07:38.310 --> 07:43.790
super he goes all kinds of things they

07:40.530 --> 07:43.790
do at last so be careful

07:44.420 --> 07:47.540
[Music]

07:48.340 --> 07:59.180
me how on how and where did you receive

07:56.090 --> 08:06.550
the ability to awaken the Kundalini in

07:59.180 --> 08:06.550
them I had it born with it

08:10.400 --> 08:13.960
one can be born with it

08:16.660 --> 08:24.370
but I realized that to give a mass

08:21.640 --> 08:30.040
realization seventh Center has to be

08:24.370 --> 08:38.849
opened first of all that I read on the

08:30.040 --> 08:38.849
fifth of May 1970 and then I realized

08:39.510 --> 08:49.470
that with this happening one can achieve

08:44.020 --> 08:56.020
a masse realization but till that time I

08:49.470 --> 08:59.680
had to understand human beings so by my

08:56.020 --> 09:03.940
subtle methods I tried to understand

08:59.680 --> 09:08.380
what was their problem what chakras they

09:03.940 --> 09:11.290
had in trouble how I have to work out

09:08.380 --> 09:13.600
the permutations and combinations in

09:11.290 --> 09:16.080
such a way that our mas realization can

09:13.600 --> 09:16.080
be achieved

09:18.340 --> 09:27.100
so this amaz realization I started from

09:24.190 --> 09:30.610
that day before that I did not speak

09:27.100 --> 09:36.900
about it because what's the use of

09:30.610 --> 09:42.750
another Bible or another Gita better to

09:36.900 --> 09:47.980
achieve the results unless and until

09:42.750 --> 09:52.350
human beings realize that there are

09:47.980 --> 09:55.750
higher stories of awareness within them

09:52.350 --> 10:01.810
whatever you may tell them they are not

09:55.750 --> 10:04.780
going to understand so first it must be

10:01.810 --> 10:09.310
done they have to realize that there are

10:04.780 --> 10:12.190
higher awareness states which we have to

10:09.310 --> 10:17.650
achieve which we have achieved and then

10:12.190 --> 10:21.490
they can go further my father himself

10:17.650 --> 10:24.280
was a very great evolved soul and he

10:21.490 --> 10:27.670
told me that those who are born on the

10:24.280 --> 10:31.780
10th story shouldn't talk about they

10:27.670 --> 10:33.850
should come down and try to raise the

10:31.780 --> 10:35.980
people at least to the first or second

10:33.850 --> 10:39.040
story so they realize there are stories

10:35.980 --> 10:40.630
beyond because if they just talk about

10:39.040 --> 10:43.660
the 10th story people will think they

10:40.630 --> 10:49.210
are crazy or they'll crucify them

10:43.660 --> 10:51.839
they'll never understand that won't be

10:49.210 --> 10:51.839
practical

10:53.490 --> 10:58.529
but it took some time to understand

10:55.769 --> 11:03.860
human beings there are very complicated

10:58.529 --> 11:03.860
people must say not easy

11:14.800 --> 11:20.740
in your discourse who referred to the

11:17.200 --> 11:24.880
Kundalini as she he said because you are

11:20.740 --> 11:26.279
a woman no no no geez she is the female

11:24.880 --> 11:31.020
side

11:26.279 --> 11:31.020
she's the Shakti she's the female side

11:32.070 --> 11:38.830
that's why the quarrel about women and

11:34.600 --> 11:43.209
men is all falsehood there's nothing

11:38.830 --> 11:46.660
like that they exist together it's like

11:43.209 --> 11:49.570
the moon and the moonlight like the Sun

11:46.660 --> 11:56.140
and the sunlight it's like the God and

11:49.570 --> 11:58.170
the Kundalini it's like the word and the

11:56.140 --> 11:58.170
meaning

12:16.380 --> 12:26.080
yeah it is all-pervading power all right

12:21.580 --> 12:30.250
now when the kundalini rises what she

12:26.080 --> 12:32.410
does she enlightens our subtler side of

12:30.250 --> 12:35.320
her nerves of brain and everything she

12:32.410 --> 12:38.410
enlightens and by that we start feeling

12:35.320 --> 12:40.450
it is the Enlightenment that we get

12:38.410 --> 12:41.890
because of her connection with

12:40.450 --> 12:45.190
all-pervading power

12:41.890 --> 12:48.910
it exists already it exists but you

12:45.190 --> 12:52.240
cannot feel it normally when she Rises

12:48.910 --> 12:59.320
then your nerves are so enlightened that

12:52.240 --> 13:03.240
you can feel it all right you might be

12:59.320 --> 13:03.240
already getting it and think sir

13:11.259 --> 13:19.069
no no no not she is your mother she's

13:16.699 --> 13:22.249
your individual mother who gives you

13:19.069 --> 13:22.819
your second birth she knows everything

13:22.249 --> 13:26.989
about you

13:22.819 --> 13:29.299
she has recorded everything and she does

13:26.989 --> 13:32.869
it very gently see when you were born

13:29.299 --> 13:36.350
your mother took all the pains upon

13:32.869 --> 13:39.739
herself isn't it and in the same way

13:36.350 --> 13:41.329
this Kundalini does the job but people

13:39.739 --> 13:43.730
have frightened because perhaps maybe

13:41.329 --> 13:45.290
they don't want it's the evil force I

13:43.730 --> 13:47.569
think those who have frightened against

13:45.290 --> 13:49.850
Kundalini because they don't know how to

13:47.569 --> 13:52.309
do it or maybe they don't want people to

13:49.850 --> 13:59.389
achieve their realisation I can't

13:52.309 --> 14:01.730
understand those people as I was telling

13:59.389 --> 14:06.040
you today in the 16th century guru

14:01.730 --> 14:08.509
nanaka then kuvira and all these others

14:06.040 --> 14:10.059
ramadasa toka rama all of them nobody

14:08.509 --> 14:14.929
has said it's dangerous

14:10.059 --> 14:16.850
on the contrary ramadasa was asked how

14:14.929 --> 14:18.799
much time does it take for Kundalini to

14:16.850 --> 14:20.899
rise he used the word instance with

14:18.799 --> 14:25.359
touch channel that's the moment that

14:20.899 --> 14:30.709
moment he said that Shannon that moment

14:25.359 --> 14:35.929
so but he said there's a condition the

14:30.709 --> 14:38.720
one who wants should be anxious to have
