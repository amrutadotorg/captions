00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:17.289
[Music]

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.680
you see if you if you try your own self

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.900
you see trying with Kundalini actually

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.900
sympathetic goals interactivity you have

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.890
no right on the parasympathetic

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.870
parasympathetic is the one which

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.760
balances and that is the central path of

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.280
sushumna through which the Kundalini has

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.489
to rise but if you try anything what you

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.260
do is always you can use sympathetic

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.239
I'll give an example supposing you are

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.420
running fast all right then you can

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.130
raise the rate of your heart but you

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.810
cannot slow it down it slows down light

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.210
itself that is parasympathetic activity

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.430
so you just get into sympathetic

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.570
activity and by sympathetic activity if

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.840
you overdo it

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.660
then all these symptoms happens and it's

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.610
not that on the contrary chakras go into

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.979
quite like this is our left and the

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.930
right sympathetic and these are the

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.150
centres they get pulled down right and

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:31.310
if they are full like this then you are

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:35.350
harmed so it is it is not an experience

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.350
of Kundalini but is of the sentiment

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.629
[Music]

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.440
no it doesn't go down Kundalini ver goes

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.000
down it goes upward always the thing

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.460
that comes down is the crease you see

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.790
the grace comes down not definitely

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.220
Kundalini all always goes upwards and

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.290
the grace comes on your sympathetic

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.660
which calms you down completely you

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.660
become absolutely relaxed beautiful but

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:23.400
the Kundalini itself always goes up it

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.260
never comes down but in people it so

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.930
happens that Kundalini goes through this

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.950
central path now if it is sort of very

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.560
much rugged or if it is extremely smooth

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.020
due to the mistakes of the Seekers then

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.720
it falls down it falls down is a

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.100
different point than going like that if

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.290
first off then you have to raise it

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.269
again and try them again raise it and

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.830
title in many people it has to be done

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:51.630
but it can work you will get the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.400
complete knowledge don't you worry now

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.980
he has been as you said 18 months but

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.480
he's a master of kundunese he can raise

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.209
your Kundalini and you are just like him

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.840
you will become the same there's no no

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.840
problem at all

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.320
does having a vertebra out of place in

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.860
the spine interfere with the rising of

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.990
Kundalini it does to some extent it does

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.580
definitely does but we can put a try the

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.410
vertebra can be put right and the

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.170
Kundalini can be brought in it does so

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.390
many things do happen if you have but

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.070
you are a person over read if you are

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.990
read too many books and the books are in

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.990
your head I have to empty that holes I

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.430
actually do this work as a profession

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.850
and I find that if the subtle center is

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.280
fixed the spinal problems just disappear

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.740
I used to have three and four

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.860
adjustments a week to correct my spine

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.860
and now I have none at all so first fix

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.140
the subtle within us and then the gross

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.830
part the spinal misalignments and so on

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.830
we'll just get better

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.130
[Music]

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.030
what is the first step to

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:22.539
self-realization there is nothing like

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:25.000
first second it's not a course see the

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:28.120
Kundalini it's an awakening within us

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.210
which takes place which is like a living

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:35.949
process all right so the Kundalini rises

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:38.710
and shoots off here now some people feel

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:41.490
the Kundalini wobbling down there down

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.500
below some people feel it in this town

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.260
some people feel it here some people

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.199
feel it here but most of them feel it we

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.780
are only jutting out like race so you

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:58.090
just can't say what is the first step

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:00.340
depends on how it rises so everybody

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:04.410
doesn't feel the same way so I can't say

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.410
that this is the first thing all right

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.300
of course first you feel thoughtlessly

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.280
aware you become thoughtlessly aware

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.560
first thing that should happen to you

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.690
when the kundalini crosses this Center

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.610
when it comes out of it you start

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.380
feeling the cool breeze here and you

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.180
start feeling the cool breeze in your

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.910
hands and you start feeling the cool

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.080
breeze around that's the second stage

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.080
where it can go

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:39.470
can anyone be realized without knowing

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:42.410
about Kundalini about mentally need not

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.690
know what can be realized of course you

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.420
can't be but then you have to tell them

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.430
what it is this thing is better to do

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.740
that way but there will be very few who

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.590
will accept such a situation because

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.090
they want to know about everything but

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.910
they need not know all that you can

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:02.000
little bit say tell them that there is a

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.040
way of getting realization and then it's

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.570
like this that even you come to me you

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.760
want to have the lights I'll say all

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.100
right go there's a switch you put on and

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.840
you put on the switch you get the lights

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.490
without telling about it but you would

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.210
like to know how this light is turned

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.820
and then that helps you to create other

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.520
lights that's why it is important to

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:24.080
know about Kundalini I would I can do it

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.300
without telling you anything about

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.770
Kundalini I can raise your Kundalini but

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.840
you would not know anything about and

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.970
you would not know what it is it has

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.530
happened with many who were born

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.990
realized they did not know they were

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.820
realized Souls and they got lost like I

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:41.030
would say greatest example here not on

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.550
the windshield you're not at the wind

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.500
she was a realized soul and he got lost

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.510
because he didn't know he was a realized

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.430
soul he was a higher personality than

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.820
others he got lost so many what lost

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.820
like that

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.250
how can you be lost if the kundalini has

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:08.760
been awakened latest because you see it

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:11.010
is you are not yet fully developed

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.170
mature person when you are in an image

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:15.420
or stretch it does happen Kundalini is

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:17.490
when it rises should be surprised in

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:19.380
some people it is just a wee bit just

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.240
like a hair just comes up a little

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.370
because so difficult to see you the

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.800
passage is so block so a little bit

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.870
comes up this is what it is it is a

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.640
complete realization takes place only

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.140
when you are near to be culpa Samadhi

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.120
that's the higher state so in the

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:36.480
beginning it just little bit opens up

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.310
and one person people do get lost they

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.530
do because they have egos they have

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:43.790
super he goes all kinds of things they

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.790
do at last so be careful

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.540
[Music]

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:59.180
me how on how and where did you receive

00:07:56.090 --> 00:08:06.550
the ability to awaken the Kundalini in

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:06.550
them I had it born with it

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.960
one can be born with it

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:24.370
but I realized that to give a mass

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:30.040
realization seventh Center has to be

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:38.849
opened first of all that I read on the

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:38.849
fifth of May 1970 and then I realized

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:49.470
that with this happening one can achieve

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:56.020
a masse realization but till that time I

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:59.680
had to understand human beings so by my

00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:03.940
subtle methods I tried to understand

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:08.380
what was their problem what chakras they

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:11.290
had in trouble how I have to work out

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:13.600
the permutations and combinations in

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:16.080
such a way that our mas realization can

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.080
be achieved

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:27.100
so this amaz realization I started from

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:30.610
that day before that I did not speak

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:36.900
about it because what's the use of

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:42.750
another Bible or another Gita better to

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:47.980
achieve the results unless and until

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:52.350
human beings realize that there are

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:55.750
higher stories of awareness within them

00:09:52.350 --> 00:10:01.810
whatever you may tell them they are not

00:09:55.750 --> 00:10:04.780
going to understand so first it must be

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:09.310
done they have to realize that there are

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:12.190
higher awareness states which we have to

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:17.650
achieve which we have achieved and then

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:21.490
they can go further my father himself

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:24.280
was a very great evolved soul and he

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:27.670
told me that those who are born on the

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:31.780
10th story shouldn't talk about they

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:33.850
should come down and try to raise the

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.980
people at least to the first or second

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:39.040
story so they realize there are stories

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:40.630
beyond because if they just talk about

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.660
the 10th story people will think they

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:49.210
are crazy or they'll crucify them

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:51.839
they'll never understand that won't be

00:10:49.210 --> 00:10:51.839
practical

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:58.529
but it took some time to understand

00:10:55.769 --> 00:11:03.860
human beings there are very complicated

00:10:58.529 --> 00:11:03.860
people must say not easy

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:20.740
in your discourse who referred to the

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:24.880
Kundalini as she he said because you are

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:26.279
a woman no no no geez she is the female

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:31.020
side

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:31.020
she's the Shakti she's the female side

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:38.830
that's why the quarrel about women and

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:43.209
men is all falsehood there's nothing

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:46.660
like that they exist together it's like

00:11:43.209 --> 00:11:49.570
the moon and the moonlight like the Sun

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:56.140
and the sunlight it's like the God and

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:58.170
the Kundalini it's like the word and the

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.170
meaning

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:26.080
yeah it is all-pervading power all right

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:30.250
now when the kundalini rises what she

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:32.410
does she enlightens our subtler side of

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:35.320
her nerves of brain and everything she

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:38.410
enlightens and by that we start feeling

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:40.450
it is the Enlightenment that we get

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:41.890
because of her connection with

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:45.190
all-pervading power

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:48.910
it exists already it exists but you

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:52.240
cannot feel it normally when she Rises

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:59.320
then your nerves are so enlightened that

00:12:52.240 --> 00:13:03.240
you can feel it all right you might be

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.240
already getting it and think sir

00:13:11.259 --> 00:13:19.069
no no no not she is your mother she's

00:13:16.699 --> 00:13:22.249
your individual mother who gives you

00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:22.819
your second birth she knows everything

00:13:22.249 --> 00:13:26.989
about you

00:13:22.819 --> 00:13:29.299
she has recorded everything and she does

00:13:26.989 --> 00:13:32.869
it very gently see when you were born

00:13:29.299 --> 00:13:36.350
your mother took all the pains upon

00:13:32.869 --> 00:13:39.739
herself isn't it and in the same way

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:41.329
this Kundalini does the job but people

00:13:39.739 --> 00:13:43.730
have frightened because perhaps maybe

00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:45.290
they don't want it's the evil force I

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:47.569
think those who have frightened against

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:49.850
Kundalini because they don't know how to

00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:52.309
do it or maybe they don't want people to

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:59.389
achieve their realisation I can't

00:13:52.309 --> 00:14:01.730
understand those people as I was telling

00:13:59.389 --> 00:14:06.040
you today in the 16th century guru

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:08.509
nanaka then kuvira and all these others

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.059
ramadasa toka rama all of them nobody

00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:14.929
has said it's dangerous

00:14:10.059 --> 00:14:16.850
on the contrary ramadasa was asked how

00:14:14.929 --> 00:14:18.799
much time does it take for Kundalini to

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:20.899
rise he used the word instance with

00:14:18.799 --> 00:14:25.359
touch channel that's the moment that

00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:30.709
moment he said that Shannon that moment

00:14:25.359 --> 00:14:35.929
so but he said there's a condition the

00:14:30.709 --> 00:14:38.720
one who wants should be anxious to have

00:14:35.929 --> 00:14:43.609
it and the one who gives should be an

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:46.249
authority not authority from some

00:14:43.609 --> 00:14:52.179
University or anything but authority in

00:14:46.249 --> 00:14:52.179
spirituality yes

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:25.320
no see it is alright do it

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:27.480
but do I do all that you have to be

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.790
comfortably sitting in your chair and

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:31.440
you'll get your realization you don't

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:33.770
have to go to Himalayas to stand on your

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.770
head

00:15:35.770 --> 00:16:04.019
[Music]

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:12.870
you
