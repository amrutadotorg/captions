WEBVTT

02:51.604 --> 02:59.698
Today is a special day, as you know;
we are worshipping the Goddess

03:00.140 --> 03:06.680
who came on this earth
nine times before,

03:07.163 --> 03:10.943
to kill all the demons
and all the negativity,

03:11.148 --> 03:19.308
and relieve all the
bhaktas to worship.

03:20.385 --> 03:26.325
All Her work has already
been described.

03:27.240 --> 03:35.760
Despite that they find
new type of devils,

03:37.313 --> 03:43.633
new type of negative people
have come back.

03:46.170 --> 03:51.100
Perhaps it had to be.

04:03.025 --> 04:08.315
This had to be, maybe,
after all it’s Kali Yuga.

04:08.975 --> 04:17.370
And the drama of Kali Yuga would not be
performed unless and until they are there.

04:20.308 --> 04:24.418
So to complete
this drama they came.

04:25.997 --> 04:38.397
But this time, it’s going to be
a very different type of war.

04:40.540 --> 04:45.710
It’s going to be the war
of the peaceful people.

04:47.262 --> 04:56.375
And the peaceful people are the most successful people

04:56.911 --> 05:03.061
in every walk of life, even in the war.

05:03.061 --> 05:06.611
It did not work out before.

05:07.203 --> 05:11.793
They say that when
Genghis Khan came,

05:12.467 --> 05:20.177
he went to a very big monastery
of Buddhists near Gaya

05:20.882 --> 05:23.392
and killed all of them.

05:23.732 --> 05:27.122
There were about thirty
thousand of Buddhists there

05:27.630 --> 05:32.920
and they didn’t say a word,
and they were all killed.

05:34.132 --> 05:38.172
So people started
disbelieving in Buddhism.

05:38.735 --> 05:44.175
They said, “What kind of a Buddhism
is here? Why didn’t Buddha save them?”

05:45.020 --> 05:49.220
That’s human style of thinking.

05:49.918 --> 05:55.462
"Buddha should have saved these thirty
thousand people who were peaceful,

05:56.175 --> 06:04.085
who were resisting in a manner
that was no resistance,

06:05.201 --> 06:10.021
and so they were all killed by this
horrible fellow called Genghis Khan."

06:10.570 --> 06:18.239
But you’ll be surprised, in this Kali Yuga,
this Genghis Khan has been praised by many authors.

06:18.478 --> 06:21.448
And there are books written about him.

06:21.865 --> 06:26.595
He was not a Muslim but
some sort of a crackpot.

06:27.325 --> 06:32.615
He finished off many mosques,

06:33.061 --> 06:40.141
he destroyed many
beautiful buildings

06:40.568 --> 06:46.078
and also, he came to India
and ruled there for a short time.

06:46.760 --> 06:49.580
All that’s a history.

06:50.417 --> 07:09.768
In the same way, there have been wars
between Christians and non-Christians,

07:11.123 --> 07:15.253
between Muslims
and non-Muslims.

07:16.030 --> 07:26.512
All kinds of wars we have heard of
where only the faithful got lost,

07:27.051 --> 07:29.411
the real people got lost.

07:29.982 --> 07:38.386
The one who worshipped
God with full faith got lost.

07:40.020 --> 07:42.900
So, many people become atheist

07:43.940 --> 07:49.827
and they said, “There is nothing like God,
nothing like his divine Power.

07:50.193 --> 07:56.484
It never existed. We were stupid,
we were foolish to follow all this".

07:56.950 --> 08:02.812
And those who were in charge of religion
took full advantage of that

08:02.812 --> 08:08.451
and said that, "These people
were sinful people,

08:08.451 --> 08:12.931
these people were not godly people,

08:13.670 --> 08:19.130
and that’s how they were killed by
us and we were victorious".

08:21.610 --> 08:27.060
The idea of victory they had
that they have been successful

08:27.454 --> 08:31.884
"and so many people have
been butchered by us".

08:36.095 --> 08:39.695
So we come to Kali Yuga,

08:40.745 --> 08:47.985
and in Kali Yuga, same thing
has started in a subtler way;

08:48.615 --> 08:51.935
in a different way
it has started that

08:51.935 --> 09:02.045
there’s a big war going on
between the people who are anti-God,

09:02.818 --> 09:08.288
and who are using God
for their own purpose.

09:08.898 --> 09:13.778
Very dishonest, very corrupt,
very cruel people.

09:14.083 --> 09:19.713
And they are using
the flag of God,

09:20.165 --> 09:26.655
that banner which they
have no right to use.

09:27.048 --> 09:34.194
Then there are Sahaja Yogis
who have got their Realization,

09:34.194 --> 09:38.883
and they have to fight them.

09:39.400 --> 09:48.000
Now the difference in the previous
wars and this war is very different.

09:50.312 --> 09:59.031
In those wars, you see, all those
who were supposed to be victorious

09:59.557 --> 10:09.827
- this was, after all, the nine battles of the Divine Mother -

10:10.722 --> 10:16.436
– the negativity that came up
and which became successful

10:16.436 --> 10:24.083
started feeling very confident that,
"We have achieved what we wanted".

10:25.650 --> 10:35.051
But in Kali Yuga,
in the light of Kali Yuga,

10:35.051 --> 10:44.548
all those historical victories
are regarded as shameful things,

10:45.435 --> 10:51.565
as something very
aggressive and nonsensical.

10:53.685 --> 10:57.235
This is now being described everywhere.

10:57.983 --> 11:08.321
Like, the white-skinned people went to America
and killed all the rest of them there.

11:09.340 --> 11:14.810
– now that is coming into light.

11:15.905 --> 11:23.605
All these people who thought
themselves to be victorious:

11:23.885 --> 11:28.058
their children, their grandchildren,
their progeny are ashamed of them!

11:28.058 --> 11:33.688
Ashamed to call that
they were their forefathers

11:33.995 --> 11:37.245
– up till the last war.

11:39.042 --> 11:49.653
This awareness which has come is the real victory of modern times,

11:49.653 --> 11:52.801
of this Kali Yuga:

11:53.061 --> 11:59.131
that everything that was
accepted as a part of the game,

11:59.131 --> 12:05.481
as the lifestyle, you can call it,

12:05.905 --> 12:11.315
is now being challenged in
modern times, everywhere.

12:11.741 --> 12:19.221
Whatever is aggression,
whatever is oppression,

12:19.839 --> 12:27.560
whatever is cruel is
now punished also.

12:30.550 --> 12:35.617
You see, so many war
criminals must have escaped,

12:35.617 --> 12:39.407
but so many went into trials

12:39.407 --> 12:41.257
– never happened before.

12:41.533 --> 12:44.903
Nobody took Genghis Khan to a trial.

12:45.340 --> 12:48.030
Now in a very subtle way

12:48.538 --> 12:52.948
all these aggressive people
are getting now afraid

12:53.061 --> 13:03.151
that they will be questioned,
and they may be tortured.

13:04.285 --> 13:06.581
It started I don’t know where,

13:06.581 --> 13:10.201
but definitely at the beginning
of the Kali Yuga.

13:10.435 --> 13:16.952
If you remember in this country was
a great aggressive man called Mussolini,

13:17.248 --> 13:20.398
and ultimately he was hanged.

13:21.255 --> 13:23.955
In Germany there was
a very powerful man

13:24.493 --> 13:27.303
called Hitler, and Himmler
and all this.

13:27.743 --> 13:30.133
God knows what
happened to them

13:30.488 --> 13:33.658
– even the Germans don’t
want to take his name,

13:33.908 --> 13:36.688
they’re all ashamed of him.

13:37.370 --> 13:40.820
Then we had somebody
say in England,

13:40.820 --> 13:43.980
Warren Hastings who
came to India

13:44.253 --> 13:46.073
– he was put to jail.

13:46.393 --> 13:50.063
This was never done before.

13:50.660 --> 13:56.920
If Napoleon aggressed people, he
thought he was very victorious;

13:57.353 --> 14:03.463
but he could not continue
with it, he had to face it.

14:04.685 --> 14:11.375
You see, anybody who has been aggressive,

14:11.793 --> 14:21.183
who has been dominating,
who has been very cruel, demonic,

14:22.188 --> 14:26.758
has been taken to task
mostly in his lifetime.

14:27.757 --> 14:34.707
Now, if not in his lifetime,

14:34.995 --> 14:39.135
afterwards he was maligned

14:39.135 --> 14:43.393
and he doesn’t have a name
like a hero or anything.

14:43.393 --> 14:47.698
People don’t want
to erect their statues.

14:48.632 --> 14:52.082
So the awareness has come
in the mind of the people.

14:52.515 --> 14:57.755
Like a person like Stalin who
ruled Russia once upon a time,

14:58.113 --> 15:02.303
today you can’t see even
one statue of Stalin.

15:02.613 --> 15:05.733
These are modern times.

15:06.830 --> 15:10.360
See the power
of modern times!

15:10.760 --> 15:13.170
And that is frightening
to those people

15:13.170 --> 15:17.870
who think they can get along
with whatever they are doing.

15:18.515 --> 15:24.565
It is going to be very
soon understood by them

15:25.323 --> 15:32.513
that they have to stop all this
nonsense, otherwise they will suffer.

15:32.998 --> 15:36.508
It’s not those whom
they are dominating

15:36.853 --> 15:40.203
but those who are
dominating will suffer.

15:40.488 --> 15:44.241
They will suffer physically,
they will suffer mentally,

15:44.551 --> 15:46.141
they will suffer emotionally,

15:46.401 --> 15:52.481
and also their fame
will be in the mud.

15:52.810 --> 16:01.730
So today’s victory of the
power of the Divine Mother

16:02.348 --> 16:08.461
is doing one very great
work, is to expose;

16:09.320 --> 16:16.156
and this exposure will be condemning publicly

16:16.156 --> 16:19.821
those people who are doing wrong.

16:21.170 --> 16:23.960
If you see from that point of view,

16:24.373 --> 16:30.363
you will understand how
we are victorious now.

16:31.258 --> 16:35.789
Many of you felt very sad
that I didn’t get the award [Peace Nobel Price].

16:35.789 --> 16:38.469
This award makes no
difference to Me,

16:38.808 --> 16:41.308
and to you also, I must tell you;

16:41.308 --> 16:45.578
because you have come without
I having any award,

16:45.863 --> 16:49.613
and many will come without
having any award as such.

16:50.318 --> 16:55.618
But this time, for the
first time, if you notice

16:55.863 --> 16:59.803
the people who got award
are condemned.

17:00.275 --> 17:06.175
Even now they are writing against it,
even now they are criticizing.

17:06.842 --> 17:11.742
So those who have been, they
thought they were very smart,

17:12.080 --> 17:14.721
but the smartness is out now

17:14.721 --> 17:16.865
and I don’t know
how long will it go on;

17:16.865 --> 17:22.041
because even today if you use, open a newspaper
you find something about it,

17:22.041 --> 17:25.401
that how stupidly
they have done it

17:25.401 --> 17:28.751
– they can’t understand what was
the reason they have done it.

17:29.253 --> 17:32.393
Not only the people who
selected are criticized,

17:32.393 --> 17:36.963
but very much more
the people who are selected.

17:38.710 --> 17:45.311
Now, as being Sahaja Yogis,
we have to know what is the difference

17:45.311 --> 17:54.001
between the consciousness at that
time and awareness at this time.

17:56.297 --> 17:59.317
That time it was necessary
to kill those demons, finish them,

18:00.531 --> 18:04.481
but they are back
again on the stage.

18:08.851 --> 18:12.991
Now at this time when
it is Kali Yuga

18:13.891 --> 18:16.791
they are exposed,

18:18.891 --> 18:21.331
they are condemned,

18:21.631 --> 18:27.751
they are put in the jail, they
are now punished publicly.

18:28.441 --> 18:32.421
So the collective awareness

18:33.421 --> 18:39.371
has got such a great victory
I think, over these people

18:39.641 --> 18:42.291
whom so many came,
killed and died

18:42.591 --> 18:44.851
without getting any
punishment out of it,

18:45.091 --> 18:49.811
without getting any
defamation out of it.

18:50.791 --> 18:53.571
Now let us see what
is consciousness

18:53.881 --> 18:57.921
and what is awareness.

19:09.251 --> 19:14.351
It is a subtle subject which
I think you all can understand.

19:16.571 --> 19:19.371
Consciousness is that

19:19.721 --> 19:23.521
when you are made conscious,
you become conscious about it.

19:23.891 --> 19:27.391
Like I have My
hand here all right,

19:27.391 --> 19:32.981
but normally I am not conscious
of it that I have a hand.

19:35.690 --> 19:40.320
If a man is sleeping, he is
not conscious that he’s sleeping.

19:40.988 --> 19:45.508
When you tell Me “You have
a hand” I become conscious;

19:46.868 --> 19:50.968
or something pricks Me,
then I become conscious

19:51.911 --> 19:55.581
– otherwise I am
unconscious about it.

19:57.451 --> 20:04.701
I am absolutely unconscious about
My eyes, I am seeing everything;

20:05.261 --> 20:11.791
but supposing I become
blind, I can’t see:

20:12.131 --> 20:16.551
then I become conscious
of My eyes,

20:16.811 --> 20:21.641
that I have got My eyes through
which now I cannot see.

20:22.185 --> 20:29.395
So once you say there is this
hand, the consciousness is there.

20:29.903 --> 20:33.573
This we can say is the
knowledge about the hand,

20:33.573 --> 20:36.733
that you get knowledge
about that.

20:38.408 --> 20:40.208
But once

20:41.758 --> 20:46.618
you are not conscious of the hand,
that knowledge is disappeared.

20:49.140 --> 20:53.620
So to say there is ignorance
or there is knowledge,

20:53.620 --> 20:57.590
both things are just the same.

20:58.543 --> 21:06.473
You are not conscious of your hand
so you are quite ignorant about it.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.728
Now supposing somebody says,

21:10.551 --> 21:13.871
“Your hands are very beautiful”.

21:14.821 --> 21:19.261
Somebody remarks like that then
I become conscious of my hand

21:19.561 --> 21:25.281
which is beautiful; otherwise
I never knew they were beautiful.

21:27.831 --> 21:32.841
So normally all human beings
live at that level,

21:33.401 --> 21:35.951
that somebody has to tell you.

21:36.241 --> 21:39.221
Now somebody said, "You
are wearing a very nice sari".

21:39.501 --> 21:45.811
All right. Then I look at it, "Yes,
it’s very nice, I never knew".

21:48.190 --> 21:52.570
So somebody has to tell you,
then you become conscious;

21:53.963 --> 21:57.263
otherwise you are not.

21:59.468 --> 22:04.408
So we all human beings
at that level are like that.

22:05.543 --> 22:09.163
Now, what is awareness?

22:10.103 --> 22:12.203
– that’s a different thing.

22:13.545 --> 22:17.805
That means if I see

22:18.508 --> 22:23.118
somebody is attacking Me
I put My hand like this.

22:23.518 --> 22:26.868
That means I’m
aware I have a hand.

22:27.340 --> 22:32.051
I’m not conscious but I’m aware that I have
a hand, I have to use it.

22:32.315 --> 22:34.725
Like here, in Italy, you
go on using your hands

22:34.725 --> 22:37.715
bringing them up all
the time like this.

22:39.103 --> 22:43.393
That means you know you
are aware that you have got hands,

22:43.798 --> 22:46.548
that you have to use
them for expressing

22:46.548 --> 22:50.378
something more sort
of emphatically.

22:53.071 --> 23:00.131
So we are sort of also
aware of our body,

23:00.491 --> 23:03.261
we are aware of others,

23:05.101 --> 23:07.491
we know about others,

23:08.021 --> 23:11.271
we know what sort of
a person another one is

23:11.671 --> 23:16.901
– up till you are Self-realized.

23:19.401 --> 23:22.291
After Self-realization what happens?

23:22.851 --> 23:24.971
It’s very interesting.

23:26.801 --> 23:33.011
After Self-realization you go
beyond both these things,

23:33.061 --> 23:37.151
consciousness and awareness,

23:38.208 --> 23:43.618
because you go beyond thought.

23:45.513 --> 23:48.843
“You have gone beyond
thought” means what?

23:49.313 --> 23:57.535
Anger, all kinds of ideas, all kinds of aggression,

23:57.535 --> 24:02.275
everything is maneuvered

24:02.275 --> 24:06.991
or worked through your mind.

24:07.535 --> 24:13.135
So if your mind is lost,
what will you do?

24:14.870 --> 24:18.210
There’s no mind anymore.

24:19.195 --> 24:23.015
You exist with reality,

24:24.411 --> 24:28.621
so there is no mind to communicate.

24:29.391 --> 24:32.151
We call it 'thoughtlessly aware'.

24:32.481 --> 24:34.211
Means what?

24:34.541 --> 24:36.941
We have conquered
all our enemies by

24:37.201 --> 24:41.221
giving up one enemy
that was our mind.

24:41.221 --> 24:44.311
There’s no mind to suggest,

24:44.663 --> 24:47.713
there’s no mind to tell you,

24:48.363 --> 24:52.943
so once there is no
mind you are lost.

24:54.245 --> 24:56.405
Now it is being said that you ask

24:56.405 --> 24:59.615
a question to yourself,
“Who am I?”

25:01.695 --> 25:04.825
As soon as you ask this question
you become thoughtless,

25:05.551 --> 25:07.841
so you get lost.

25:08.771 --> 25:12.091
You cannot answer this question.

25:12.815 --> 25:17.245
Otherwise you might say, “I am
a woman, I am this, I am that”;

25:17.245 --> 25:24.825
“I am a bishop or I am a pope,
I am this, I am that.”

25:26.440 --> 25:31.461
But once you are a Realized soul,
who will tell  you who you are?

25:31.461 --> 25:35.531
Because the one which tells
you is the mind which doesn’t exist

25:35.531 --> 25:37.351
- no thought

25:39.223 --> 25:44.723
– means you get dissolved
into your Self.

25:47.042 --> 25:49.602
This is what is reality.

25:52.373 --> 25:58.283
But you are aware also;
now that’s another point.

26:02.861 --> 26:07.501
If you ask yourself a question
you are not there,

26:09.141 --> 26:10.951
but you are aware.

26:11.721 --> 26:14.031
If your Nabhi is catching
you immediately you know

26:14.271 --> 26:17.431
“My Nabhi is catching,
I have got liver.”

26:18.761 --> 26:20.211
Don’t have to ask questions.

26:20.491 --> 26:22.201
Or somebody is standing near you,

26:22.451 --> 26:26.711
his left Swadisthana
– “Oh my God, it is this one!”

26:30.731 --> 26:32.851
If somebody is very angry
and hot tempered,

26:33.161 --> 26:35.461
immediately you’ll feel such
heat from that person,

26:35.721 --> 26:39.251
you’ll say, “Oh baba,
I’ll run away from this man.”

26:39.251 --> 26:42.591
So this is a new

26:46.258 --> 26:49.588
realm you have entered into reality,

26:50.461 --> 26:54.381
which you are never aware of before.

26:55.170 --> 27:01.030
Now supposing there’s a very
bad man standing near you.

27:02.271 --> 27:06.711
He might be a thief, he might
be a murderer, anything

27:07.011 --> 27:10.071
– you will not be even
conscious of it

27:10.371 --> 27:13.701
leave alone aware, normally.

27:14.021 --> 27:18.141
But once you are a realized soul,

27:19.371 --> 27:25.671
you become aware of the whole.

27:26.011 --> 27:28.191
That is reality.

27:28.521 --> 27:33.921
What are the problems,
in the collective?

27:34.873 --> 27:38.323
You become aware of the collective.

27:38.893 --> 27:41.823
You become aware of the
problems of the whole world.

27:42.058 --> 27:45.508
Now, this awareness is
very different.

27:46.507 --> 27:50.767
The first awareness as
I told you is like this,

27:51.230 --> 27:56.120
that if somebody tells you
you are this and this,

27:56.508 --> 27:59.768
you become aware of it.

28:01.798 --> 28:05.508
In this, nobody has to tell you;

28:07.221 --> 28:10.221
it’s just there.

28:14.181 --> 28:18.621
You are there, you know what it is.

28:20.451 --> 28:28.501
And this is what you have
achieved in these modern times,

28:29.181 --> 28:32.771
which is the blessing
of the modern times also,

28:33.191 --> 28:38.151
that we know now who we are.

28:38.790 --> 28:44.020
You always say, “We are the pure
Spirit,” yesterday also I heard it.

28:44.305 --> 28:46.255
Are you sure?

28:47.011 --> 28:50.791
What makes you believe that,

28:51.558 --> 28:55.388
that you are the pure Spirit?

28:56.405 --> 28:59.945
I mean, you haven’t seen
your Spirit, have you?

29:00.555 --> 29:03.655
You haven’t seen yourself
what you are.

29:04.488 --> 29:07.428
Then how do you say you
are the pure Spirit?

29:07.938 --> 29:14.338
It’s just you are saying
something because I say so.

29:16.657 --> 29:22.577
But you are the pure Spirit,
because whatever the description

29:22.577 --> 29:25.047
of the pure Spirit is given

29:25.830 --> 29:30.020
that it is aware

29:31.611 --> 29:37.111
of the divine Power.

29:38.661 --> 29:42.031
It is aware of the Divine Power,

29:42.711 --> 29:47.031
and that is how you
are the pure Spirit;

29:47.571 --> 29:50.861
because only
through pure Spirit

29:51.181 --> 29:53.841
as your personality

29:54.131 --> 30:01.841
you can be aware of this
All-pervading Power.

30:03.011 --> 30:10.161
This is written in all the 'shastras',
in all the scriptures, everywhere.

30:10.911 --> 30:14.011
And what do you know
about yourself?

30:15.571 --> 30:22.841
– that you are the Spirit, because
you know about your own chakras,

30:22.841 --> 30:26.171
you know about your own nadis.

30:26.895 --> 30:32.395
Now, what has happened is that
you are separated from your self

30:32.395 --> 30:36.505
and you can see your self.

30:37.815 --> 30:41.995
You see yourself very clearly,

30:44.270 --> 30:53.500
and you start seeing yourself as the
present and the past and the future.

30:55.311 --> 30:58.751
“In the past what I was”
– you see, you’re shocked now

30:59.031 --> 31:01.551
“my goodness, I was like this.”

31:01.941 --> 31:05.981
You see it through this
present state,

31:06.261 --> 31:09.391
in the present state you see.

31:09.973 --> 31:16.473
Then you start forgetting it,
“Forget the past, forget the past.”

31:19.753 --> 31:23.013
Then still you have the future;

31:23.510 --> 31:29.290
then you start thinking
about the future.

31:30.268 --> 31:36.423
First future they think about their
own children, their wives - Sahaja Yogis also.

31:36.948 --> 31:43.668
“What will happen to my children?
What will happen to my wife?”

31:44.923 --> 31:49.753
Then they think, “What will
happen to Sahaja Yoga?”

31:50.635 --> 31:54.475
Then they think, “What
will happen to Mataji?”

31:55.905 --> 32:00.205
Also they think, “What will
happen to this world?”

32:01.419 --> 32:09.627
Because your awareness
has expanded,

32:11.360 --> 32:15.760
you are not in the limited
sphere now anymore.

32:17.548 --> 32:20.388
You can think of your children,
you can think of your wife,

32:20.388 --> 32:23.868
also you can think
of the whole world

32:24.895 --> 32:29.885
and all the problems of
the world you think about.

32:31.980 --> 32:35.480
So you have reached
that state, all right;

32:35.963 --> 32:39.113
up to that state we are.

32:40.055 --> 32:42.945
Now what is the thing

32:45.591 --> 32:51.281
that covers up all this
or gives you solutions,

32:51.551 --> 32:55.931
say, for your children, for your
family, your wife, everyone

32:56.191 --> 32:58.621
– what is the solution?

33:00.091 --> 33:05.511
Your Mother believes in giving
solutions, not only the problems

33:06.701 --> 33:10.191
Because these days
there are not problems

33:10.521 --> 33:14.261
that existed in the Navaratri.

33:15.981 --> 33:18.261
They no more exist,

33:18.571 --> 33:25.141
that you can take a sword
in your hand and go and

33:25.421 --> 33:27.961
kill someone; no, it doesn’t,

33:28.881 --> 33:32.541
it’s not possible – cut what?

33:33.811 --> 33:38.821
So the today’s problem
as they are, as we see

33:40.561 --> 33:44.491
– within us we see the problems,

33:44.741 --> 33:49.511
we are aware of it and we
want to do something about it.

33:50.431 --> 33:53.801
Whether we are in the past,
present or future,

33:54.081 --> 33:56.831
we see the problem.

34:00.781 --> 34:04.091
So now what is the solution?

34:05.501 --> 34:13.571
We have no weapons,
nothing to fight.

34:15.301 --> 34:17.481
We don’t know also,
so many do not

34:17.761 --> 34:21.401
know even how to hold
a sword in the hand,

34:21.981 --> 34:25.161
and so many don’t
even want to hold it;

34:26.441 --> 34:29.281
because they are so
much in compassion,

34:29.581 --> 34:33.051
in the ocean of compassion
enjoying themselves nicely.

34:34.351 --> 34:37.841
They are enjoying their own
compassion and compassion of others,

34:38.131 --> 34:40.721
compassion of their Mother.

34:41.331 --> 34:44.851
But then how to solve the problem?

34:50.051 --> 34:52.651
The problem can be solved

34:52.881 --> 34:58.261
if you become very
powerful yourself within.

35:01.641 --> 35:04.441
Where is your attention?

35:08.071 --> 35:10.961
You have to move inward.

35:11.411 --> 35:13.791
Where is your attention?

35:15.331 --> 35:19.241
You have to become very powerful.

35:20.271 --> 35:25.041
I have done My job, I have
given you realization.

35:26.021 --> 35:29.781
You have grown so much,
I have explained to you,

35:30.031 --> 35:32.831
I’ve told you everything
– it’s done.

35:33.341 --> 35:37.091
I have given you lots of love,

35:37.351 --> 35:41.931
ocean of love, I should say,
as you call it, whatever it is.

35:43.890 --> 35:47.490
But now you have to
nourish yourself.

35:48.621 --> 35:53.141
You have to become
powerful within yourself.

35:55.393 --> 35:59.473
So what is the way you
can become powerful?

36:04.405 --> 36:06.905
First, you must believe

36:07.841 --> 36:12.561
that you have transcended
your human personality

36:12.841 --> 36:18.371
and you have now become
a super-human being.

36:23.150 --> 36:27.350
First of all, this must come in you.

36:28.159 --> 36:31.275
This is what we call as faith.

36:31.940 --> 36:37.011
This faith is not false
faith, is not blind faith

36:37.301 --> 36:43.171
that you believe into
something, but it’s a fact.

36:44.827 --> 36:48.081
I have a hundred times,
I have told you

36:48.391 --> 36:53.481
that you have first of all
faith in your ascent

36:53.751 --> 36:57.741
in your position as Sahaja Yogis.

37:00.219 --> 37:06.753
For this meditation is
very important, very important.

37:07.015 --> 37:12.655
Without meditation you cannot
have full faith in yourself,

37:13.892 --> 37:21.099
because you can’t know yourself
by saying, “Who am I?” You cannot.

37:22.550 --> 37:28.870
You try now. Ask a question within,
“Who am I?” You’ll be lost.

37:36.891 --> 37:38.521
So what should be the faith then?

37:38.761 --> 37:43.341
Because when you ask the question
“Who am I?” you are lost.

37:50.541 --> 37:54.071
So we reach a stage
where I have to tell you

37:54.351 --> 38:01.691
that faith is not mental, it is
not emotional, it is not physical,

38:02.051 --> 38:08.441
but it is a state of your own being

38:09.201 --> 38:13.921
which we can call as
a spiritual state.

38:18.751 --> 38:22.041
In the spiritual state

38:24.671 --> 38:30.291
nothing can disturb you,

38:32.491 --> 38:35.741
nothing can overpower you,

38:36.561 --> 38:39.871
nothing can dominate you;

38:42.061 --> 38:45.461
because that state if you have,

38:45.821 --> 38:52.301
that means you are part
and parcel of reality.

38:53.561 --> 39:01.441
Then you are a honored member
of the God’s kingdom.

39:03.501 --> 39:12.331
Then you are the most
revered personality.

39:13.921 --> 39:17.131
Then you are like a deity.

39:18.451 --> 39:21.691
Then you are like a Gana.

39:23.331 --> 39:28.051
In that state when you are
– it’s a state, again I say,

39:28.761 --> 39:32.411
beyond the human state

39:34.471 --> 39:39.101
– you are extremely powerful.

39:45.651 --> 39:49.301
There’s a story about
Nizamuddin – the great Auliya,

39:49.591 --> 39:52.501
great Sufi in India.

39:52.941 --> 39:55.691
There was a horrible king

39:55.991 --> 39:59.301
I think what Shah he called himself;

39:59.931 --> 40:05.161
and he would not go and bow
to him. So he was very angry.

40:05.441 --> 40:09.081
He said, “I can only bow
to God and to nobody else.”

40:10.681 --> 40:14.671
This Shah said, “If you don’t come
and bow to me tomorrow,

40:14.921 --> 40:18.171
I will cut your throat.”

40:18.901 --> 40:23.471
And that night, the throat
of this king was cut.

40:24.451 --> 40:28.881
It’s a story, but it’s a real story.

40:30.791 --> 40:36.221
Somebody came and cut his throat
– it was not Nizamuddin Sahib.

40:36.501 --> 40:39.631
He would not do that.

40:42.151 --> 40:46.131
So that state if you reach,

40:47.561 --> 40:53.351
what we call is
the state of shraddha,

40:53.661 --> 41:00.961
state of shraddha

41:01.281 --> 41:07.711
which is enlightened,
enlightened faith.

41:09.711 --> 41:17.181
It’s a new type of mechanism;

41:19.851 --> 41:27.251
that is, you become part
and parcel of the whole.

41:28.401 --> 41:31.991
That means the moon, the star- see

41:33.021 --> 41:37.591
I tell you, I never told the sun that
it should be there for the pujas -

41:37.881 --> 41:40.511
last time, this time - I never tell him.

41:40.821 --> 41:45.161
There’s no need to tell,
it’s all done.

41:47.621 --> 41:51.211
I don’t tell all these vibrations

41:51.511 --> 41:57.491
to make a cross or to show these,
all these miraculous photographs.

41:57.751 --> 42:01.291
I don´t tell them, there´s no need to tell.

42:04.371 --> 42:08.321
They just do it by themselves.
I am sometimes surprised

42:08.651 --> 42:11.441
how ingenious methods
they have of their own,

42:11.701 --> 42:15.101
how they manage things
– I am myself surprised.

42:16.141 --> 42:19.041
I didn’t tell them that
these two persons

42:19.321 --> 42:21.341
who were selected by this award

42:21.591 --> 42:25.501
should be so condemned
by every newspaper.

42:25.891 --> 42:29.201
It all works automatically,

42:32.711 --> 42:35.431
it just works.

42:35.791 --> 42:41.671
Only thing if I have anything is
just complete, complete faith

42:41.941 --> 42:44.791
that I am at that state,

42:45.381 --> 42:50.081
and that’s why there is
complete patience, 'saburi',

42:50.671 --> 42:53.131
complete patience.

42:58.371 --> 43:02.181
And that is what we have to learn.

43:03.301 --> 43:09.391
It will all happen in any case
because you are all at that state.

43:10.071 --> 43:13.531
Only meditation is important,
very important;

43:13.811 --> 43:16.901
for Me not, but for you all.

43:17.761 --> 43:20.741
If you all can meditate now,

43:21.361 --> 43:28.541
just for ten minutes also every day,

43:29.461 --> 43:31.921
it will help you a lot.

43:32.971 --> 43:39.601
Now, why do we have all these
statues and, I mean the Mother

43:40.171 --> 43:45.051
and the Hanumana
and Ganesha, Christ?

43:45.751 --> 43:48.891
Because to begin with,
human beings cannot

43:48.891 --> 43:53.771
understand anything which
does not have a form.

43:55.366 --> 44:00.676
They cannot go deeper unless
and until there’s a form.

44:01.313 --> 44:04.301
But they went to another
limit of using any stone,

44:04.301 --> 44:08.631
anything, as God and all that.

44:10.381 --> 44:12.541
But now you have discretion:

44:12.911 --> 44:15.401
you know what is to be worshipped,

44:15.691 --> 44:24.471
what is to be treated as a higher
personality – that you know.

44:24.991 --> 44:29.631
But before that they would
worship all kinds of people,

44:29.881 --> 44:34.101
like now people worship pope,
you know that very well.

44:35.291 --> 44:36.971
But now what to do?

44:37.521 --> 44:40.521
They are not only blind,

44:40.861 --> 44:46.281
they are not only unaware, but
they are also not conscious of it.

44:47.471 --> 44:51.951
They are all at such a level
that you cannot tell them.

44:52.901 --> 44:55.981
So you are a new type
of people I should say,

44:56.271 --> 45:01.001
who have tried to fight
it out, to struggle out,

45:01.281 --> 45:05.891
to know about the absolute truth.

45:07.611 --> 45:12.361
Unless and until you know
the absolute truth,

45:13.381 --> 45:15.321
you are nowhere;

45:15.901 --> 45:21.701
you have no discretion, you have no
understanding, you have no wisdom.

45:22.981 --> 45:25.661
But once you know the absolute truth,

45:26.001 --> 45:31.351
then you should not by any chance

45:32.261 --> 45:35.211
be halfway this and halfway that.

45:35.911 --> 45:42.841
That’s a very dangerous
state of affairs.

45:43.201 --> 45:50.591
Say a seed is sprouted, it is
neither a seed nor a tree.

45:53.281 --> 45:57.171
If it doesn’t grow it is useless.

45:57.611 --> 46:00.871
That’s happens to your
awareness – I am again talking

46:01.191 --> 46:04.471
of your consciousness, awareness

46:08.021 --> 46:13.811
– and then you are neither
here nor there.

46:14.421 --> 46:21.161
There are many people who come
to Sahaja Yoga perhaps, maybe

46:21.911 --> 46:25.061
to find some peace.

46:25.711 --> 46:27.931
But I get letters:

46:28.181 --> 46:32.601
“My father is sick, my mother is
sick, my sister is sick.”

46:32.911 --> 46:37.711
Then otherwise, “My husband is fighting
with me, I am seeking a divorce.”

46:38.071 --> 46:40.201
Or thirdly, “I’ve lost all my money,

46:40.441 --> 46:43.081
I must have some money.”

46:43.431 --> 46:45.981
Fourthly, “I am a great artist but I,

46:46.221 --> 46:48.971
my art is not selling.”

46:49.251 --> 46:54.301
All these stupid problems
they bring for Me.

46:54.631 --> 46:59.791
Hah – “My children are no good,
they are troublesome.”

47:00.081 --> 47:02.011
Then, “My wife is fighting with me,

47:02.271 --> 47:04.951
my mother is fighting with
me, brother is fighting.”

47:05.191 --> 47:09.771
But I said, “What sort
of Sahaja yogis these are?”

47:13.881 --> 47:19.361
The state of being one
with the reality

47:22.181 --> 47:28.121
means that the whole
of reality is at your feet,

47:29.671 --> 47:32.321
whole of it works for you;

47:33.281 --> 47:38.281
and once you even
get a glimpse of that state

47:38.561 --> 47:45.781
I tell you, you become so much
peaceful within yourself.

47:51.151 --> 47:54.951
If you say, “I am the king,
I am the king,”

47:55.401 --> 47:58.491
if you say, “I am the beggar,
I am the beggar,”

47:58.811 --> 48:01.951
what difference does it
make to that state

48:02.241 --> 48:07.431
which is like a purest of pure gold,

48:07.891 --> 48:11.541
which cannot be tarnished?

48:14.831 --> 48:18.651
Such a state of mind
we have to develop.

48:20.081 --> 48:23.901
It’s a more a challenge to us.

48:24.641 --> 48:27.521
We are Sahaja yogis, all right.

48:28.161 --> 48:31.111
We have got realization, all right.

48:31.741 --> 48:34.861
We can sing very well, all right.

48:35.221 --> 48:38.651
We have achieved good
positions, all right.

48:39.581 --> 48:42.551
We are nicely married, all right.

48:43.121 --> 48:46.021
We’ve got nice children,
we have got everything,

48:46.291 --> 48:48.511
we have got jobs, this that.

48:48.831 --> 48:55.711
Now, suddenly one negative force
comes in to trouble you – so what?

48:59.441 --> 49:01.441
So what?

49:04.581 --> 49:09.181
Otherwise how will you
know what you are?

49:10.671 --> 49:15.041
If there is no darkness, how will
you know you are the light?

49:17.281 --> 49:27.221
It’s a challenge to your own
state, at what state you are.

49:28.181 --> 49:33.641
The word “state” is not so
explanatory. In Sanskrit is swarupa,

49:34.061 --> 49:36.261
swarupa

49:39.191 --> 49:46.101
– “swa” is yourself
and “rupa” is form or state.

49:47.821 --> 49:53.861
That state is possible
for all of you

49:56.011 --> 50:00.841
by saying “Not this, not this,
not this, not this.”

50:03.781 --> 50:11.011
As it is, your mind has reached
that state that there is no mind

50:11.341 --> 50:13.681
– you can do that.

50:14.341 --> 50:20.611
But you have to develop
a kind of a personality

50:21.061 --> 50:24.841
that realizes what you are.

50:28.051 --> 50:31.791
But in that realization

50:33.981 --> 50:36.891
you are just aware of it,

50:37.181 --> 50:39.161
not conscious of it.

50:39.481 --> 50:42.161
I´ll, for example, I'll tell you.

50:43.351 --> 50:47.241
I am aware that I am Adi Shakti
– I am aware, I know.

50:47.601 --> 50:52.971
But when you say “Jai Shri Mataji”
I also say “Jai Shri Mataji,”

50:53.261 --> 50:57.771
forgetting that I am the
one you are talking about.

51:00.621 --> 51:06.041
This is actually,
should be the state:

51:07.231 --> 51:10.881
that you are aware, yes, you
are aware in the sense, in the

51:11.151 --> 51:14.651
- I don’t know how to say
- but I am aware I am that.

51:14.901 --> 51:17.311
If you ask Me, “Mother,
are You Adi Shakti?”

51:17.571 --> 51:24.231
I said, “Yes, I am” - because
I know that, that I am.

51:24.641 --> 51:27.951
But when you say
“Jai Shri Mataji” I forget that

51:28.201 --> 51:33.241
I am Adi Shakti and I also say
“Jai Shri Mataji” with you.

51:36.711 --> 51:42.081
I forget, I have to tell you,
“No, no, you can't say it”.

51:43.931 --> 51:45.221
It’s very interesting.

51:45.531 --> 51:49.271
Now, you make Me sit
here like a queen

51:49.591 --> 51:52.371
and give Me a presents,
this thing, that thing;

51:52.641 --> 51:57.484
I mean, all right, that’s your idea.

51:59.998 --> 52:08.458
But to Me, you see, I am
complete in Myself, I think so.

52:10.941 --> 52:16.061
This in Hindi: “Me kahenge ki
hum apne hi andar samma gaye”

52:17.221 --> 52:22.581
"I am - got lost into Myself".

52:22.851 --> 52:26.231
All right, you do this, all right;
you should do that, all right.

52:26.511 --> 52:30.279
If you don’t do it, it’s all right.

52:31.501 --> 52:35.571
To Me it makes no difference;
it may make difference to you,

52:35.571 --> 52:37.501
but to Me it does not.

52:37.791 --> 52:43.061
Like, I´ve been saying, "Now don´t give me any presents,
don´t give me any presents", all these days.

52:43.241 --> 52:45.391
So the only argument is that,

52:45.391 --> 52:49.191
“The whole year, we give You once,
so why should You, Mother, object?

52:49.191 --> 52:51.001
because that gives us joy.”

52:51.271 --> 52:54.031
All right, if you think
it gives you joy, do it,

52:54.341 --> 52:57.711
but to Me, it doesn’t matter.

53:01.921 --> 53:05.541
Because I don’t think I am there.

53:08.021 --> 53:13.041
I am just seeing you
sitting here, all right.

53:13.311 --> 53:17.620
They are all Realized souls, all right.

53:19.301 --> 53:22.685
But I am one of you.

53:23.281 --> 53:26.221
I don’t think I am very special.

53:26.961 --> 53:31.531
But if you ask Me then I will say,
"All right, I am Adi Shakti".

53:31.801 --> 53:36.362
But I don’t think Adi Shakti
is very special also,

53:38.330 --> 53:40.630
because I’ve no mind.

53:41.321 --> 53:43.611
But otherwise, I don’t think
it’s something special.

53:43.871 --> 53:47.271
Because somebody is
something, so what?

53:48.341 --> 53:53.871
Now supposing sun is
sun, so what? He is a sun.

53:55.121 --> 53:59.324
If somebody is Adi Shakti
– so Adi Shakti, so what?

54:00.135 --> 54:07.008
But for you it is creditable
because you were not born Realized.

54:07.008 --> 54:10.634
You got your Realization.

54:10.826 --> 54:15.961
So you are special, you are great,

54:15.961 --> 54:18.411
you have achieved something.
I’ve achieved nothing;

54:18.411 --> 54:23.061
I have been like this and
I will be like this.

54:24.793 --> 54:28.701
Whether I fight the devils
or I sit before you

54:28.701 --> 54:31.771
makes no difference,
I will be like this.

54:31.771 --> 54:37.731
But for Me you are great,
because you have achieved this.

54:37.731 --> 54:41.521
Today to see you
on this Navaratri day,

54:41.751 --> 54:46.950
so many people sitting
to worship Me!

54:48.421 --> 54:51.321
So many people are here,

54:51.591 --> 54:56.431
so many Sahaja Yogis
- it’s so remarkable!

54:56.941 --> 54:59.431
It’s not My achievement, I tell you,

54:59.651 --> 55:01.481
it’s your seeking.

55:01.701 --> 55:05.617
Because I have been on this
earth many a times before

55:06.820 --> 55:08.901
that you know.

55:09.671 --> 55:11.881
But we never had like this.

55:12.161 --> 55:15.861
So many came, got crucified,
died, this, that,

55:16.101 --> 55:19.061
but I never had people of this kind.

55:21.198 --> 55:24.718
So again we come
to the same point,

55:25.661 --> 55:33.061
that we should be aware
of ourselves

55:34.691 --> 55:37.591
– complete shraddha
in yourself.

55:38.311 --> 55:41.741
If you have some shraddha
in yourself,

55:42.051 --> 55:45.299
you’ll have shraddha about Me also,

55:45.531 --> 55:49.491
because we are not different.

55:51.681 --> 55:54.451
If you believe this is water,

55:54.721 --> 55:59.190
then everywhere there is water
I believe that that is water, isn’t it?

55:59.453 --> 56:02.461
Because I know this is water,

56:03.281 --> 56:07.871
so wherever in the world there
is water, I know it is water.

56:08.768 --> 56:12.111
So if you know you are
a Sahaja Yogi,

56:12.531 --> 56:19.153
anywhere there is a Sahaja Yogi, you know there is
a Sahaja Yogi, this is a Sahaja Yogi.

56:19.153 --> 56:27.231
But as far as you are concerned
you forget how great you are,

56:27.231 --> 56:30.161
and how far you can go.

56:30.161 --> 56:33.631
I am very proud of you,
you don’t know.

56:33.631 --> 56:39.441
But because I am a humble person,

56:39.631 --> 56:43.061
I don’t know how to show off.

56:44.141 --> 56:51.668
So, I have such nice children,
so many of them, so lovable.

56:52.703 --> 56:59.412
Those bhaktas for whom She killed
so many demons and all that

57:00.431 --> 57:02.751
were not like you.

57:03.061 --> 57:09.125
You are much better, much higher,
of a much greater quality.

57:09.561 --> 57:13.761
But you must know that you are.

57:13.761 --> 57:19.541
And don’t behave like
those people who

57:19.943 --> 57:24.871
were of a very rudimentary nature.

57:25.371 --> 57:29.421
You are grown up,
you have prospered,

57:29.851 --> 57:34.147
and now the fruits we can see.

57:35.523 --> 57:39.181
I don’t know what to
do for you, really.

57:39.561 --> 57:44.483
But have faith in yourself.

57:45.481 --> 57:49.561
Then you will see how much
faith you will have in reality,

57:49.801 --> 57:53.341
that there is reality with
you at every step,

57:53.581 --> 57:56.261
every moment.

57:59.801 --> 58:01.901
No fear,

58:05.141 --> 58:08.725
no sense of achievement - nothing!

58:09.391 --> 58:12.550
Done now, finished!

58:13.061 --> 58:15.331
When there were 5 Sahaja Yogis,
I was happy,

58:15.331 --> 58:17.421
when there are so many, I am happy.

58:17.421 --> 58:23.061
But I, when I see so many, I think

58:24.191 --> 58:32.745
there are so many powerful
personalities who are one with reality.

58:33.791 --> 58:40.995
This collective oneness
was never so.

58:41.526 --> 58:48.251
And so I would say that, on this day,

58:48.251 --> 58:54.341
what we have to do is to
kill the devils within ourselves;

58:54.548 --> 58:57.415
that’s all.

58:58.101 --> 59:01.001
If you want to really worship Me,

59:01.211 --> 59:05.818
that’s what you have to think,
what are the devils within you

59:05.818 --> 59:07.328
That’s all.

59:07.648 --> 59:10.879
So you don’t have to worry
otherwise for outside devils,

59:10.879 --> 59:14.170
they cannot do anything to you.

59:15.883 --> 59:19.432
May God bless you.
