00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.390
Easter Puja
Istanbul, Turkey

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.390
April 19, 1998

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:18.660
Today we are celebrating the resurrection
of Christ.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.680
That is the greatest message of Christ's life,
not the crucifixion.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:43.540
Anybody can be crucified and killed, but this
dead body of Christ was resurrected from death.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:51.300
Death itself died, and He overcome it.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:07.480
It's a miracle for ordinary human beings,
definitely, but not for Christ, because He

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.530
was a Divine person.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:18.590
He was Shri Ganesha, He was Omkara Itself.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:29.130
So He could walk on the water, gravity would
not affect Him.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:37.920
And also He got resurrected because death
could not affect Him.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:50.860
Such a great Divine personality, specially
created for human beings, that people should

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.070
recognize Him.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.200
But they did not recognize Him.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.880
They killed Him in a very brutal manner.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:14.390
And even now they think cross is a great thing
because Christ died on the cross.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:22.770
It's a very cruel idea of human beings to
respect the cross.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.509
What does it show?

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:42.960
It shows that people liked all the cruelties
done to Him, symbolizing cross as the one

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:53.099
that represented His death and His atrocities,
the way He was tortured.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:03:02.900
So it was a very sad time when He was crucified.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:14.220
But when He got resurrected, it was the most
joyous, most auspicious and most beautiful

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.220
time.

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:27.730
The resurrection of Christ is very symbolic
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:40.140
If Christ could be resurrected, then human
beings also can be resurrected, because He

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:49.300
came as a human being with all powers, and
He created the path of resurrection for us.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:57.920
This path of resurrection is the one that
we have followed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:07.610
But the greatest thing is the piercing of
the Agnya Chakra which is described in all

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:22.070
spiritual treatise, or may be called as the
scriptures, that that is the door which is

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:32.540
golden, which is like a cover, and no one
can pass through that, so constricted is this

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.334
door of Agnya Chakra.

00:04:38.654 --> 00:04:43.205
But Christ did cross that.

00:04:43.205 --> 00:04:54.595
His crossing has helped us today to
open your Agnya.

00:04:54.595 --> 00:05:00.374
Without opening the Agnya you cannot go to
Sahasrara.

00:05:00.374 --> 00:05:10.105
And this was done so easily in your case,
only because Christ could go through all that

00:05:10.105 --> 00:05:16.495
torture and all that brutality, and crossed
over.

00:05:16.495 --> 00:05:27.024
How much we should be indebted to Him, I don't
know words that can express, because He is

00:05:27.024 --> 00:05:33.624
the One who took lead in telling people that
“You seek.

00:05:33.624 --> 00:05:36.725
You seek and you'll find.”

00:05:36.725 --> 00:05:45.994
And then He says that “You have to come
and bang at the door.”

00:05:45.994 --> 00:05:54.415
This is exactly what has happened in your
case, that you have risen up to Agnya and

00:05:54.415 --> 00:05:58.065
then you have crossed beyond Agnya.

00:05:58.065 --> 00:06:08.855
This crossing of Agnya was not at all difficult
for you, though by your own ideas of thinking

00:06:08.855 --> 00:06:16.434
and of conditioning, of the futuristic planning
and all that, it was a big, big crowd, I should

00:06:16.434 --> 00:06:24.154
say, of very black clouds were hovering on
the Agnya.

00:06:24.154 --> 00:06:33.304
Your thoughts were overpowering you, and you
could not have penetrated through this Agnya

00:06:33.304 --> 00:06:35.714
which was all covered.

00:06:35.714 --> 00:06:42.475
But you did, and you never even felt that
you have crossed the Agnya Chakra so easily.

00:06:42.475 --> 00:06:51.424
The first of all, we all should really be
very thankful to Christ for opening the Agnya

00:06:51.424 --> 00:06:52.765
for you.

00:06:52.765 --> 00:07:03.124
For Him all the tortures and all the brutality
were nothing, because His purpose of life,

00:07:03.124 --> 00:07:11.545
His purpose of His advent, His incarnation,
was to break the Agnya Chakra.

00:07:11.545 --> 00:07:19.644
Today you will find that even though your
Agnya is opened out and you have crossed through,

00:07:19.644 --> 00:07:31.464
still you'll be amazed that people get involved
in the Agnya Chakra.

00:07:31.464 --> 00:07:36.575
In Sahaja Yoga people do get involved in Agnya
Chakra.

00:07:36.575 --> 00:07:43.565
Now how do we see through introspection what
happens to us?

00:07:43.565 --> 00:07:56.455
For example, once people come to Sahaja Yoga,
they think they are in charge: in charge of

00:07:56.455 --> 00:08:06.175
this, in charge of that, in charge of all
the Sahaja Yogis; and they start behaving

00:08:06.175 --> 00:08:12.055
in a manner which doesn't behove a Sahaja
Yogi.

00:08:12.055 --> 00:08:13.795
It doesn't.

00:08:13.795 --> 00:08:22.015
I've seen them, and I really am amused the
way they just start thrusting themselves and

00:08:22.015 --> 00:08:27.785
showing off that they are very much in charge.

00:08:27.785 --> 00:08:30.575
This is nothing modern.

00:08:30.575 --> 00:08:35.915
This is used to be there with human beings.

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:43.574
But if it was so, it was before Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:43.574 --> 00:08:52.615
Even now people get into the mood of dominating
others by saying that “We are in charge.”

00:08:52.615 --> 00:09:00.195
Sahaja Yoga is not so simple as you think,
because there are lots of temptations.

00:09:00.195 --> 00:09:02.675
Supposing you make somebody a leader.

00:09:02.675 --> 00:09:15.055
Now a leader becomes sort of “in charge,”
you know, and he gets the drunkenness of power.

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:27.215
When he's like that he starts dominating all
the rest of the people, and also starts showing

00:09:27.215 --> 00:09:41.085
off that he's something very great and he
has to dominate all the rest of the people.

00:09:41.085 --> 00:09:43.165
Then he creates an atmosphere of fear.

00:09:43.165 --> 00:09:49.845
Firstly, I've seen what happens with them
is that they start saying falsely that “Mother

00:09:49.845 --> 00:09:55.485
has told this, Mother has said so, this is
Mother's ideas.”

00:09:55.485 --> 00:09:59.805
I have nothing to do with that gentleman,
but he goes on talking like that, and people

00:09:59.805 --> 00:10:01.374
get very frightened.

00:10:01.374 --> 00:10:07.875
Then also he can also frighten you by saying,
“I will tell Mother.

00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:13.004
Mother will listen to me and She'll punish
you.”

00:10:13.004 --> 00:10:20.215
I am sometimes very surprised at such people,
because I have never said that I'll punish

00:10:20.215 --> 00:10:27.074
somebody or I'll take him out of Sahaja Yoga
- nothing of the kind.

00:10:27.074 --> 00:10:31.694
So this man who thinks no end of himself,
he may be a leader, may not be a leader, may

00:10:31.694 --> 00:10:41.264
be nothing in Sahaja Yoga; and then if he
starts talking like this in such a funny manner

00:10:41.264 --> 00:10:45.915
that it doesn't look that the person is a
Sahaja Yogi.

00:10:45.915 --> 00:10:52.605
Then he goes even further.

00:10:52.605 --> 00:11:03.194
He goes himself describing as something very
great, as if he's the one who is chosen specially

00:11:03.194 --> 00:11:06.115
for rising higher and higher.

00:11:06.115 --> 00:11:10.074
When I hear about these things I'm really
amazed.

00:11:10.074 --> 00:11:20.884
How can people befool themselves all the time,
and behave in such a manner?

00:11:20.884 --> 00:11:24.405
First thing in Sahaja Yoga is humility.

00:11:24.405 --> 00:11:28.657
If you are not a humble person, you cannot
be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:11:28.657 --> 00:11:38.446
The person who orders about, the person who
talks in a manner as if he is Hitler, any

00:11:38.446 --> 00:11:48.906
person who tries to control and be in charge
of the thing, all these capacities only show

00:11:48.906 --> 00:11:54.754
that that person has achieved nothing in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:11:54.754 --> 00:11:59.045
First thing is to enjoy the humility.

00:11:59.045 --> 00:12:04.744
I've seen people like this, they'll always
sit in the first row.

00:12:04.744 --> 00:12:08.605
They'll be always sitting in a place where
you just see them all the time there.

00:12:08.605 --> 00:12:10.345
I just smile.

00:12:10.345 --> 00:12:13.815
I know they are just show-offs.

00:12:13.815 --> 00:12:18.374
They think no end of themselves, and that's
why they are there.

00:12:18.374 --> 00:12:24.355
But they themselves are losing, they themselves
are not very happy.

00:12:24.355 --> 00:12:31.165
That's why they try to do all these tricks
and this kind of domination.

00:12:31.165 --> 00:12:46.205
The other side of it is people who are humble,
who are simple, who are honest and who are

00:12:46.205 --> 00:12:51.645
really seeking the truth, are being oppressed
by this gentleman.

00:12:51.645 --> 00:13:00.275
He oppresses them, tries to show off, tries
to make slaves out of others.

00:13:00.275 --> 00:13:11.655
I have seen people have gone so far that there
was a group of people who just would not move

00:13:11.655 --> 00:13:16.884
even an inch without the permission of their
leader.

00:13:16.884 --> 00:13:25.025
And they would go all out to be subservient
to such a irrational personality.

00:13:25.025 --> 00:13:32.194
First of all, you know this is the love of
Mother.

00:13:32.194 --> 00:13:34.835
Mother never dominates.

00:13:34.835 --> 00:13:39.405
She cannot dominate, because She is nothing
but love.

00:13:39.405 --> 00:13:46.115
As soon as She sees the problem, immediately
She absorbs it.

00:13:46.115 --> 00:13:54.475
She has to make deliberations, just a drama
sometimes to show that She's angry.

00:13:54.475 --> 00:13:58.275
But She cannot basically be angry with anyone.

00:13:58.275 --> 00:14:05.495
It's the love which all the time, all the
time is flowing.

00:14:05.495 --> 00:14:09.635
And that love envelops the Mother, as well
as envelops you.

00:14:09.635 --> 00:14:14.514
That is how you people will understand Sahaja
Yoga.

00:14:14.514 --> 00:14:19.514
What does a human being need is nothing but
love and compassion, love and compassion of

00:14:19.514 --> 00:14:24.975
a very, very pure type.

00:14:24.975 --> 00:14:30.205
Look at Christ.

00:14:30.205 --> 00:14:34.145
He pitied the people who crucified Him.

00:14:34.145 --> 00:14:41.095
He told His Father, the God Almighty, that
“Please forgive them, because they do not

00:14:41.095 --> 00:14:43.395
know what they are doing.”

00:14:43.395 --> 00:14:50.775
He could see that the blindness of these people
are doing wrong things, and God the Father

00:14:50.775 --> 00:14:55.505
will be very annoyed, Who is wrathful and
may destroy them.

00:14:55.505 --> 00:15:09.045
So this is what it was done with a very compassionate
feeling, without thinking about, just automatically

00:15:09.045 --> 00:15:18.295
He felt that these people are doing all this
to Me, and I don't know what will happen to

00:15:18.295 --> 00:15:19.735
them.

00:15:19.735 --> 00:15:22.254
So He prayed to God, to Father, “Please
forgive.

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:25.434
Please forgive them, for they do not know
what they are doing.

00:15:25.434 --> 00:15:29.055
They are blind, so please do not punish them.”

00:15:29.055 --> 00:15:30.105
What compassion!

00:15:30.105 --> 00:15:31.145
What love!

00:15:31.145 --> 00:15:38.244
I mean, think of it: do we do that in our
life?

00:15:38.244 --> 00:15:47.014
If somebody harms us, troubles us, do we ask
Father to forgive those who do not know what

00:15:47.014 --> 00:15:48.014
they are doing?

00:15:48.014 --> 00:15:54.455
That should be the level of Sahaja Yoga, and
it will work out very well.

00:15:54.455 --> 00:16:01.725
If you ask for forgiveness, God will look
after them, He’ll transform them, He'll

00:16:01.725 --> 00:16:05.444
bring them to their senses.

00:16:05.444 --> 00:16:16.615
The message of Christ are full of love, compassion,
pure compassion.

00:16:16.615 --> 00:16:24.695
How He tried to protect Mary Magdalene is
an example of that, who was leading a sinful

00:16:24.695 --> 00:16:31.175
life; and for a saint it had nothing to do,
He had nothing to do with her.

00:16:31.175 --> 00:16:39.025
But when He saw she being stoned by people,
He stood against her, took a stone in His

00:16:39.025 --> 00:16:49.985
own hand, and He says, “All right, those
who have not committed any wrong deed or have

00:16:49.985 --> 00:16:55.815
not committed any sin, can take this stone
and hit Me.”

00:16:55.815 --> 00:17:02.995
And nobody came forward, because they had
to face themselves.

00:17:02.995 --> 00:17:16.075
When we are dominating others, then a kind
of a cruel joy is there, some sort of a joy

00:17:16.075 --> 00:17:21.155
that I don't understand Myself, but people
have.

00:17:21.155 --> 00:17:29.685
They show off that we have achieved this joy,
we have achieved this great power.

00:17:29.685 --> 00:17:40.225
It has happened for centuries, with all the
great emperors and also despotic rulers.

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:45.205
But with Sahaja Yogis it should be the other
way round.

00:17:45.205 --> 00:17:53.305
They have to rule the world with peace and
love.

00:17:53.305 --> 00:17:56.845
They don't have to show off, by any chance.

00:17:56.845 --> 00:18:00.845
This is how Sahaja Yoga will spread much,
much fast.

00:18:00.845 --> 00:18:06.985
What does the world need? - you just think
of it.

00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:08.665
It needs only love and affection.

00:18:08.665 --> 00:18:22.065
Those people who are yet lost in the ignorance
about life and are still busy troubling others,

00:18:22.065 --> 00:18:30.745
torturing others, going against the collectivity,
will have to return to normalcy.

00:18:30.745 --> 00:18:36.705
It’s very abnormal behavior sometimes, and
you just don’t understand why they behave

00:18:36.705 --> 00:18:37.705
like mad people.

00:18:37.705 --> 00:18:49.255
It is very difficult also to tell such a person
that “You are mad.”

00:18:49.255 --> 00:18:57.135
And also it’s difficult to be with such
a person who is so mad with some sort of a

00:18:57.135 --> 00:18:58.385
power.

00:18:58.385 --> 00:19:03.675
It goes on like that with so many Sahaja Yogis,
I have seen, who start thinking they have

00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:12.855
lots of powers, they can do whatever they
like, they can talk to anyone and they can

00:19:12.855 --> 00:19:14.355
confuse everyone.

00:19:14.355 --> 00:19:24.185
But in Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to confuse,
you have to clearly express your love.

00:19:24.185 --> 00:19:31.615
But that doesn’t mean any kind of a particular
gesture or a particular happening, but it

00:19:31.615 --> 00:19:39.145
is just a inner oneness with each other.

00:19:39.145 --> 00:19:53.885
Is, sometimes I find Sahaja Yogis so much
understanding each other, so much loving each

00:19:53.885 --> 00:20:01.495
other, so beautifully enjoying the love of
other people.

00:20:01.495 --> 00:20:09.015
When I see that I feel very, very happy, absolutely
overjoyed.

00:20:09.015 --> 00:20:18.405
That’s what I wanted: these people should
enjoy, is there.

00:20:18.405 --> 00:20:26.295
And you’ll be amazed, the most enjoyable
thing is the love that you give to others.

00:20:26.295 --> 00:20:33.605
You may not receive, but when you give love
to others, then it’s the most enjoyable

00:20:33.605 --> 00:20:34.605
thing.

00:20:34.605 --> 00:20:46.705
But the way you express yourself is also an
art, I think, to understand how to please

00:20:46.705 --> 00:20:49.635
others, how to make them happy.

00:20:49.635 --> 00:20:55.465
I've told this story before also, about a
saint who lived in Gaganbhoura, is a, what

00:20:55.465 --> 00:21:01.905
you can say is a hill or a mountain.

00:21:01.905 --> 00:21:11.435
He used to live there and he couldn't walk,
you see: because of vibrations he lost his

00:21:11.435 --> 00:21:16.475
legs or something, the power in them.

00:21:16.475 --> 00:21:25.235
And then he would go all over the place on
a tiger, because tiger loved him and he loved

00:21:25.235 --> 00:21:27.075
the tiger.

00:21:27.075 --> 00:21:35.165
So this gentleman was all the time telling
people from Bombay, “What are you doing

00:21:35.165 --> 00:21:36.165
here?

00:21:36.165 --> 00:21:37.165
Mother has come!

00:21:37.165 --> 00:21:38.955
Go and touch Her Feet.”

00:21:38.955 --> 00:21:45.045
I didn't know why he was so much concerned.

00:21:45.045 --> 00:21:48.395
So I told Sahaja Yogis, “I must go and meet
him.”

00:21:48.395 --> 00:21:55.535
So all these gurus, you see, they say that
“We don't leave our pillows.

00:21:55.535 --> 00:22:01.885
We have to be in our own pillow” - means
wherever they live, they exist, they won't

00:22:01.885 --> 00:22:02.885
go out.

00:22:02.885 --> 00:22:06.075
I'm the other way round.

00:22:06.075 --> 00:22:09.865
I'm never stationed in one place, you see.

00:22:09.865 --> 00:22:12.825
So they asked if I could go.

00:22:12.825 --> 00:22:14.935
I said, “Why not?”

00:22:14.935 --> 00:22:19.765
So I went there, and the Sahaja Yogis said
that “Mother, You never go anywhere, so

00:22:19.765 --> 00:22:23.085
why do You want to go here?”

00:22:23.085 --> 00:22:31.685
I said, “All right, see the vibrations,”
and it’s tremendous vibrations.

00:22:31.685 --> 00:22:36.935
So when I went up, this fellow was very angry
with the rain because he was supposed to control

00:22:36.935 --> 00:22:40.925
the rain, he was supposed to be controlling
the rain.

00:22:40.925 --> 00:22:51.775
It's very surprising that when I went up,
he could not control and I got completely

00:22:51.775 --> 00:22:52.775
drenched.

00:22:52.775 --> 00:22:56.405
So he was very angry.

00:22:56.405 --> 00:23:02.955
He was sitting on a stone, you know, and he
was going like this with anger.

00:23:02.955 --> 00:23:04.135
I didn't say anything to him.

00:23:04.135 --> 00:23:15.085
I went inside and sat in the cave, where he
had made some arrangement for Me to be seated.

00:23:15.085 --> 00:23:22.555
Then he came, he touched My Feet, and he sat
down.

00:23:22.555 --> 00:23:30.745
And I was amazed that he was still angry and
he couldn't understand why the rain could

00:23:30.745 --> 00:23:31.745
not stop.

00:23:31.745 --> 00:23:38.255
So he asked Me, “Why did You not allow me
to stop that rain?

00:23:38.255 --> 00:23:46.075
Because after all You are coming to see me
all the way, and the rain should have behaved.

00:23:46.075 --> 00:23:51.985
And I also could not somehow or other control
the rain, so what was the thing, what was

00:23:51.985 --> 00:23:52.985
the lesson?”

00:23:52.985 --> 00:23:54.465
I just smiled.

00:23:54.465 --> 00:24:02.415
I said, “See, you are an ascetic, you are
a sanyasi, and I am your Mother.

00:24:02.415 --> 00:24:11.005
I cannot take a sari from you because after
all you are a sanyasi, and you are not supposed

00:24:11.005 --> 00:24:14.025
to take anything from a sanyasi.”

00:24:14.025 --> 00:24:20.015
Even the Mother cannot take anything from
him.

00:24:20.015 --> 00:24:23.745
“But you have bought a nice sari for Me.

00:24:23.745 --> 00:24:29.305
So I had to get drenched so that I could take
a sari from you.”

00:24:29.305 --> 00:24:34.605
You see, the sweetness of My telling him just
made him melt down.

00:24:34.605 --> 00:24:37.015
He started crying.

00:24:37.015 --> 00:24:43.995
He said, “We need a Mother for this world.

00:24:43.995 --> 00:24:46.157
There should be the Mother.

00:24:46.157 --> 00:24:54.275
We cannot solve it, because whatever it is,
we get angry or we want to disappear.

00:24:54.275 --> 00:25:05.835
We don't want to be with these horrible people
who are so sinful, to help them.”

00:25:05.835 --> 00:25:12.145
This is the problem with the world today,
and that's why you find very few spiritual

00:25:12.145 --> 00:25:16.155
people in the whole world.

00:25:16.155 --> 00:25:24.385
Because they are the ones who are being very
much tortured, troubled, insulted, all kinds

00:25:24.385 --> 00:25:28.385
of things happen.

00:25:28.385 --> 00:25:33.115
So they're struggling, struggling, so they
want to die very fast.

00:25:33.115 --> 00:25:43.815
Gyaneshwara, such a great personality, such
a great writer, poet, I mean he was everything,

00:25:43.815 --> 00:25:46.675
so beautifully he has written.

00:25:46.675 --> 00:25:53.835
But at the age of twenty-three he took his
samadhi, means he went into a cave, and closed

00:25:53.835 --> 00:25:56.485
the cave and died there.

00:25:56.485 --> 00:26:05.035
Must have been tired and fed up with the surroundings
of ignorant people, and that's why he did.

00:26:05.035 --> 00:26:14.765
So you can imagine a person like Gyaneshwara,
who was the incarnation of Kartikeya, had

00:26:14.765 --> 00:26:24.285
to recede into the world of the dead because
he couldn't bear it any more the way they

00:26:24.285 --> 00:26:25.695
were torturing them.

00:26:25.695 --> 00:26:35.765
They tortured him so much, saying that he
is the son of a sanyasi and he has, I mean

00:26:35.765 --> 00:26:45.765
it's like this: “son of a sanyasi” means
he is no good, he is absolutely like an illegitimate

00:26:45.765 --> 00:26:53.175
child; and he is ill-treated to such an extent,
he didn't even have shoes to wear in that

00:26:53.175 --> 00:26:54.255
heat of India.

00:26:54.255 --> 00:26:56.045
He used to walk bare feet.

00:26:56.045 --> 00:27:03.695
And his sister, brother, who were great scholars,
who were great saints, great incarnations,

00:27:03.695 --> 00:27:05.275
all of themself.

00:27:05.275 --> 00:27:14.395
As a result he wanted just to disappear, and
he made a beautiful way of doing it, that

00:27:14.395 --> 00:27:22.105
he told them that “I have to go,” and
he took leave from them and went inside his

00:27:22.105 --> 00:27:27.105
cave, and got his samadhi.

00:27:27.105 --> 00:27:33.005
Even Christ was very young when He was crucified.

00:27:33.005 --> 00:27:39.085
He was thirty-three years of age.

00:27:39.085 --> 00:27:56.265
It was all planned by the Divine that He was
to be crucified, to make way for our Sahaja

00:27:56.265 --> 00:28:07.675
Yoga: to open the Agnya, to sacrifice His
life, and for Him to be hanged in such a horrendous,

00:28:07.675 --> 00:28:17.665
cruel way, which normally you do not find
people behaving in such a manner towards a

00:28:17.665 --> 00:28:20.525
person who is about to die.

00:28:20.525 --> 00:28:29.335
So what happened, that those people who were
in charge of His crucifixion must have been

00:28:29.335 --> 00:28:32.985
some devils, the way they behaved.

00:28:32.985 --> 00:28:41.035
It is not possible to forgive them even if
He, Christ says; it's difficult to forgive

00:28:41.035 --> 00:28:46.915
such people who were watching the crucifixion
of Christ.

00:28:46.915 --> 00:29:05.225
So if that is the case that a person like
Him thought that “Let Me do My job, is to

00:29:05.225 --> 00:29:08.755
break Sahasrara.”

00:29:08.755 --> 00:29:16.195
And then He didn't want to live, live with
these stupid people to be tortured, and He

00:29:16.195 --> 00:29:23.375
just disappeared into Kashmir, where He lived
after His resurrection.

00:29:23.375 --> 00:29:35.955
Lots of stories are there about His ascent
and His resurrection, and you see, all those

00:29:35.955 --> 00:29:43.355
stories if you read, you'll be amazed how
miraculously He got His second birth, you

00:29:43.355 --> 00:29:48.465
can say, or second life in Kashmir.

00:29:48.465 --> 00:29:56.355
He lived in Kashmir happily for some time
with His Mother, and there He died.

00:29:56.355 --> 00:30:05.575
They say there's a grave of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and also His Mother who was there.

00:30:05.575 --> 00:30:12.565
But who has taken advantage of His life, from
His life?

00:30:12.565 --> 00:30:13.565
Who are the people really who wanted Him to
die?

00:30:13.565 --> 00:30:19.455
You know very well.

00:30:19.455 --> 00:30:39.185
You know very well how Christ died, and the
people came up suddenly, like Paul and Peter,

00:30:39.185 --> 00:30:41.785
who tried to make a big business out of it.

00:30:41.785 --> 00:30:55.705
It's very sad to see that these two persons
brought such a shame.

00:30:55.705 --> 00:31:01.855
This Paul was nothing but an organizer, I
think, also a beginner.

00:31:01.855 --> 00:31:06.755
You see, he was a person who was bureaucratic,
I should say.

00:31:06.755 --> 00:31:13.155
But he was not only bureaucratic, he was also
a man who wanted to have a big position.

00:31:13.155 --> 00:31:26.125
So he told a lie that he went down to Damascus,
and on his way, on his way he saw a big cross.

00:31:26.125 --> 00:31:36.125
According to Sahaja Yoga all such signs are
a sign of supra-conscious, is not of the Spirit.

00:31:36.125 --> 00:31:43.095
And then he came back and he started his own
research, and sort of things like that.

00:31:43.095 --> 00:31:45.495
And he's written a lot of things.

00:31:45.495 --> 00:31:55.845
But throughout if you read, you'll find that
he was not a Sahaja Yogi, he was just an organizer.

00:31:55.845 --> 00:32:02.375
He was a bureaucratic personality who was
writing how we should administer, how we should

00:32:02.375 --> 00:32:11.235
have people who are different types of people,
how should we manage them.

00:32:11.235 --> 00:32:13.475
So he's management department.

00:32:13.475 --> 00:32:17.145
He was the management department for the Christians.

00:32:17.145 --> 00:32:26.865
So the Christians also became extremely, very
secretariat type: like you see, everything

00:32:26.865 --> 00:32:34.525
has a time, you must come like this, you must
sit like this, must talk like this.

00:32:34.525 --> 00:32:41.905
And also the nations which are supposed to
be Christians are observing all that in a

00:32:41.905 --> 00:32:43.765
very official manner.

00:32:43.765 --> 00:33:00.195
It is not understood why, why are they so
much official in everything?

00:33:00.195 --> 00:33:08.765
Just the opposite what Christ did, is to break
the Agnya, they built up this.

00:33:08.765 --> 00:33:16.285
And the Christian nations became the most
arrogant, most aggressive nations in the whole

00:33:16.285 --> 00:33:17.285
world.

00:33:17.285 --> 00:33:23.085
For them, it was their right to occupy any
land they saw.

00:33:23.085 --> 00:33:33.894
It was in their right to establish their own
laws, their own, I should say, assemblies.

00:33:33.894 --> 00:33:37.255
All this is done in India, I know.

00:33:37.255 --> 00:33:47.765
Even today if you go to places like Punjab
and all that, you'll find the people are just

00:33:47.765 --> 00:34:02.255
living like rustic people working very hard,
and they are all the time under attack from

00:34:02.255 --> 00:34:14.925
people who are dominating, and those who wanted
the full advantage to be taken out of these

00:34:14.925 --> 00:34:17.824
people.

00:34:17.824 --> 00:34:26.054
It was a ridiculous thing to behave like that
as Christians.

00:34:26.054 --> 00:34:30.094
Then also they started converting people.

00:34:30.094 --> 00:34:34.175
It's another nonsense, converting.

00:34:34.175 --> 00:34:39.115
Converting them in the south, in the...

00:34:39.115 --> 00:34:45.574
What they did is to - we Indians never make
breads; they don't know how to use an oven

00:34:45.574 --> 00:34:46.754
in the south.

00:34:46.754 --> 00:34:54.295
So they made huge, big cakes - you can call
it a cake or you can call it a bread - and

00:34:54.295 --> 00:35:04.304
put it in the water or in a well, and they
would say that we have put the part of the

00:35:04.304 --> 00:35:12.564
calf of a buffalo or could be a cow, or something
like that.

00:35:12.564 --> 00:35:15.745
And they just believed them.

00:35:15.745 --> 00:35:22.104
And so they said, “Now you are finished,
because you're no more belonging to Hindu

00:35:22.104 --> 00:35:24.954
religion or to any other religion.

00:35:24.954 --> 00:35:27.324
So now you have become Christian.”

00:35:27.324 --> 00:35:35.795
And that's how they made thousands and thousands
of people Christians who were actually downtrodden

00:35:35.795 --> 00:35:40.834
people, I should say - at least, they would
call themselves downtrodden.

00:35:40.834 --> 00:35:50.475
Now all these downtrodden people, they wanted
to have converted to Christianity, because

00:35:50.475 --> 00:36:05.425
they thought - you see, it is, they all wanted
all such people who would just follow the

00:36:05.425 --> 00:36:11.784
missionaries, and who would not question.

00:36:11.784 --> 00:36:19.784
Because they were not educated people, they're
not people of any understanding or intelligence

00:36:19.784 --> 00:36:22.625
to understand what these people are.

00:36:22.625 --> 00:36:30.485
So when they started this tirade against the
downtrodden people, so many of them joined.

00:36:30.485 --> 00:36:42.074
Thus they formed their own race and they started
their religion there.

00:36:42.074 --> 00:36:48.794
This is a thing one should understand, how
the dominating nature of people accepted a

00:36:48.794 --> 00:36:57.784
particular religion, because that religion
is nothing but humility.

00:36:57.784 --> 00:37:07.804
And how then these people supposed to be in
charge of Christianity, converted people into

00:37:07.804 --> 00:37:10.215
something absurd.

00:37:10.215 --> 00:37:21.715
You see it is a human nature, it can enjoy
any nonsense, any kind of cruelty, any kind

00:37:21.715 --> 00:37:23.014
of oppression.

00:37:23.014 --> 00:37:31.965
It can never give up that realm, that area
where they have been dominating.

00:37:31.965 --> 00:37:42.235
Now as it is, the Christian nations have gone
even beyond that, because among the Christians

00:37:42.235 --> 00:37:45.755
it is all the freedom given to them.

00:37:45.755 --> 00:37:46.935
They're liberated.

00:37:46.935 --> 00:37:52.834
Do whatever you may like, if you will become
Christian.

00:37:52.834 --> 00:37:55.785
They're all right, isn’t it?

00:37:55.785 --> 00:38:03.844
They are the ones who have been dominating,
and those who are dominated are there everywhere.

00:38:03.844 --> 00:38:14.074
They would go to people, ordinary people whom
you can call as aboriginals, and convert them.

00:38:14.074 --> 00:38:16.365
Theirs main method was to convert.

00:38:16.365 --> 00:38:20.615
What was the need to convert so many people?

00:38:20.615 --> 00:38:26.895
Because in democracy it is important that
the number you have should be large.

00:38:26.895 --> 00:38:35.534
So to gain the number, they used to convert.

00:38:35.534 --> 00:38:41.764
And they have ruined so many people.

00:38:41.764 --> 00:38:52.604
It’s really, the whole situation of Christ
really makes Me feel very nervous.

00:38:52.604 --> 00:38:56.284
Today you all are Sahaja Yogis.

00:38:56.284 --> 00:39:02.794
You are all so much higher than others.

00:39:02.794 --> 00:39:08.685
You have all the powers.

00:39:08.685 --> 00:39:16.685
And then supposing you want to behave like
the Christians, I don't know what you will

00:39:16.685 --> 00:39:17.685
do.

00:39:17.685 --> 00:39:26.615
So now you are on the verge where Sahaja Yoga
is accepted in different countries, and there

00:39:26.615 --> 00:39:34.244
people respect people who are Sahaja Yogis,
they have given positions.

00:39:34.244 --> 00:39:42.264
Then suddenly you might get this power business
into your head and you may try, you may try

00:39:42.264 --> 00:39:51.895
to become like a despot, because that is human
nature.

00:39:51.895 --> 00:39:57.885
That's not divine, but that's a human nature.

00:39:57.885 --> 00:40:11.935
For example, when in the kingdom of, we can
say of the animals, they are aggressive on

00:40:11.935 --> 00:40:17.175
each other, it's all right, it's permitted,
it is done.

00:40:17.175 --> 00:40:22.705
But there's a system, there's a way, there's
a method how they dominate.

00:40:22.705 --> 00:40:25.945
It's not like this: they jump on everyone.

00:40:25.945 --> 00:40:32.005
But I've seen in Sahaja Yoga many people,
you make them a leader - finished.

00:40:32.005 --> 00:40:35.284
Then he sits on everybody's head.

00:40:35.284 --> 00:40:39.695
If you don't make them a leader then they
go on writing letters to Me, one after another,

00:40:39.695 --> 00:40:42.915
that “Mother, we want to be leader.

00:40:42.915 --> 00:40:45.285
I want to be a leader.”

00:40:45.285 --> 00:40:48.395
Like this they go on insisting on this.

00:40:48.395 --> 00:40:52.885
For what do you want to be the leader?

00:40:52.885 --> 00:40:55.285
Just to dominate others.

00:40:55.285 --> 00:41:00.574
And this domination business is not meant
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:00.574 --> 00:41:13.584
I am here today to tell you about, about a
beautiful image of Christ, who rose above

00:41:13.584 --> 00:41:14.725
death.

00:41:14.725 --> 00:41:32.034
In the same way let the death of all nonsensical
ideas, all negative thoughts, everything has

00:41:32.034 --> 00:41:35.645
to be overcome.

00:41:35.645 --> 00:41:44.604
You have to be the lord of yourself, and in
that you should feel so comforted, so happy.

00:41:44.604 --> 00:41:55.375
In giving others, you’ll find it very much
easier than taking something from others.

00:41:55.375 --> 00:42:04.804
It’s very, very surprising how Sahaja Yoga
has taught you all these things.

00:42:04.804 --> 00:42:14.965
In Sahaj Yog people have to say that “They
are very wonderful, they are very beautiful

00:42:14.965 --> 00:42:15.965
people.

00:42:15.965 --> 00:42:22.285
They are very loving, they are very kind.”

00:42:22.285 --> 00:42:34.025
I want to, I want to hear that all the time
about them, about you all, that you all are

00:42:34.025 --> 00:42:41.794
individually or collectively, you are something
outstandingly great.

00:42:41.794 --> 00:42:55.655
But this greatness is not by domination or
by showing off, but it is coming from within.

00:42:55.655 --> 00:42:58.215
People see you and know it is something.

00:42:58.215 --> 00:43:00.935
And that is how Sahaja Yoga is going to spread.

00:43:00.935 --> 00:43:08.744
It is the Christ within you has to arise,
Christ within you has to guide.

00:43:08.744 --> 00:43:18.625
It is Christ within you who will teach how
to behave towards others, and how to gain

00:43:18.625 --> 00:43:26.525
their confidence and give them the love and
peace that you have now flowing within you,

00:43:26.525 --> 00:43:32.564
to make them very, very happy and joyous people.

00:43:32.564 --> 00:43:35.495
This is the message of resurrection.

00:43:35.495 --> 00:43:40.334
This is the message of breaking the Sahasrara.

00:43:40.334 --> 00:43:50.054
So this egg which was described in the - very
surprising, very clearly described in "Devi

00:43:50.054 --> 00:43:56.955
Mahatmayam," how this egg was formed and was
broken into two, and from one part of the

00:43:56.955 --> 00:43:59.865
egg came out Christ.

00:43:59.865 --> 00:44:03.504
Another part was Shri Ganesha.

00:44:03.504 --> 00:44:13.395
It’s all written down, but this Christ is
described as Mahavishnu, not as Christ, so

00:44:13.395 --> 00:44:21.895
this Mahavishnu then rose and He does all
these, all wonderful things.

00:44:21.895 --> 00:44:34.675
It’s a real message beautifully written
by the life of Christ, that now as we are

00:44:34.675 --> 00:44:45.984
thoughtlessly aware now, we have to express
that light through our lives, and we have

00:44:45.984 --> 00:44:57.365
to show to the world that we are quite capable,
and that only we are within ourselves absolutely

00:44:57.365 --> 00:44:58.365
complete.

00:44:58.365 --> 00:45:01.324
We don’t want anything from others.

00:45:01.324 --> 00:45:06.774
What we want now, to give whatever we have
achieved to others.

00:45:06.774 --> 00:45:15.395
This is what people are looking at you, and
at all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:45:15.395 --> 00:45:22.314
May God bless you.

00:45:22.314 --> 00:45:37.455
Thinking of Christ, I find it impossible to
keep awake even because, to keep in these

00:45:37.455 --> 00:45:49.405
modern times, it's very difficult when you
are thinking of Christ and talking about Him.

00:45:49.405 --> 00:46:00.594
It just, something shows that how people never
understood such a great man, such a great

00:46:00.594 --> 00:46:01.594
personality.

00:46:01.594 --> 00:46:05.475
And He was Divine, absolutely Divine; despite
that He made a drama, we should say, to go

00:46:05.475 --> 00:46:07.804
through all the sufferings.

00:46:07.804 --> 00:46:21.594
It's very painful, even to remember all that:
how He crucified Himself and how He died.

00:46:21.594 --> 00:46:32.104
But the main point is this: He's done for
you, for all of you, and you are so indebted

00:46:32.104 --> 00:46:33.104
to Him.

00:46:33.104 --> 00:46:44.705
It is His work which has helped the Kundalini
to be awakened and could pass through this

00:46:44.705 --> 00:46:47.074
fontanelle bone area.

00:46:47.074 --> 00:46:53.335
All this would have been impossible without
the sacrifice of Christ.

00:46:53.335 --> 00:47:03.354
You all should thus deserve to have some sacrifices.

00:47:03.354 --> 00:47:09.445
See, this is a very symbolic thing that has
happened.

00:47:09.445 --> 00:47:20.525
And you all should be all the time prepared
to sacrifice whatever is possible, for the

00:47:20.525 --> 00:47:23.125
emancipation of humanity.

00:47:23.125 --> 00:47:28.165
It's very, very subtle at this moment now.

00:47:28.165 --> 00:47:32.715
Forget about your seeking, forget about everything.

00:47:32.769 --> 00:47:45.149
What is needed is that you have to remember
all the time that you are saved, you are being

00:47:45.199 --> 00:47:49.419
blessed, by the sacrifices of Christ.

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:51.929
It's very important.

00:47:51.959 --> 00:47:56.848
May God bless you all.
