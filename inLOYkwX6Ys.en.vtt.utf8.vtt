WEBVTT

00:00.193 --> 00:04.103
I have been telling them that

00:04.667 --> 00:08.760
the style of Indian knowledge

00:08.785 --> 00:12.013
is very different from the Western mind.

00:12.585 --> 00:15.984
In the West, you see, if you say something,

00:16.009 --> 00:20.925
then they want to have an experimental approval.

00:21.142 --> 00:27.236
They will go to the scientists or to other
people who are equipped

00:27.261 --> 00:32.384
with knowledge to know what they said
in these books is true or not.

00:32.409 --> 00:34.181
They will even judge Christ.

00:34.206 --> 00:37.777
They would even judge Moses.

00:37.802 --> 00:39.554
They would judge everybody

00:39.579 --> 00:44.604
as if they are the most intelligent
and the most capable people.

00:45.500 --> 00:48.951
And they write books after books against them

00:49.936 --> 00:55.753
disclosing as if they are those people
who have said something,

00:55.778 --> 00:59.384
have said out of their
minds or something.

01:00.196 --> 01:04.601
It is never accepted normally

01:04.665 --> 01:08.842
and if it is accepted they become absolutely fanatics.

01:08.867 --> 01:15.590
So, now according to Indian style of

01:16.138 --> 01:21.744
understanding is that first of all if a great Rishi

01:21.769 --> 01:24.178
or great Muni or a great...

01:24.234 --> 01:27.865
you can call a saint has
said something,

01:28.294 --> 01:34.185
then he has said it, while you have to just listen to that

01:35.518 --> 01:38.295
because you are not equally the same.

01:38.320 --> 01:44.665
Whatever he has said is his own experience,
his own knowledge

01:44.957 --> 01:49.028
and you have no business to judge him or to say

01:49.053 --> 01:53.430
this is not true, that is not true.

01:54.261 --> 01:56.523
You accept it

01:56.684 --> 02:01.699
and once you get your self-realization,
it is clearly written down

02:02.326 --> 02:05.600
after self-realization,
you have to grow.

02:06.096 --> 02:12.240
Grow into perfect being and then you can see
for yourself

02:12.265 --> 02:17.206
what he has said or they have said is the truth.

02:17.779 --> 02:20.296
So the approach is different.

02:20.483 --> 02:24.150
In one way if you start going through science,

02:24.238 --> 02:28.136
through this, through that, you cannot reach anywhere

02:28.161 --> 02:31.010
and moreover your growth is stunted.

02:31.299 --> 02:36.862
So, what you have to do is to go to this knowledge

02:37.372 --> 02:40.876
through believing in what they have said.

02:40.901 --> 02:43.901
Whatever Christ has said, you have to believe,

02:44.393 --> 02:47.440
whatever Mohammad has said, you have to believe,

02:47.833 --> 02:51.298
whatever Guru Nanak has said,
you have to believe,

02:51.354 --> 02:55.800
whatever Gyandeva has said, you have to believe,

02:55.895 --> 02:58.162
Lao Tse you have to believe: like that.

02:58.187 --> 03:02.894
Because you are not of that spiritual level.

03:03.525 --> 03:05.096
So accept it.

03:05.524 --> 03:09.342
Now do not try to analyze it.
Everything you try to analyze

03:09.413 --> 03:12.464
and in that analysis you get lost.

03:13.199 --> 03:18.487
So once you are a realized soul of that level

03:18.844 --> 03:23.741
and then you grow into your fullness

03:24.114 --> 03:26.209
what we call sampurna --

03:26.559 --> 03:30.444
then only you will know whether whatever they have

03:30.469 --> 03:34.576
said is true or not and then you can find out.

03:35.009 --> 03:40.228
It is very easy, then, to know whatever is
said is true or not.

03:41.789 --> 03:47.575
For Sahaja Yogis now is very easy to find
out if something is real or unreal,

03:47.600 --> 03:51.975
if it is truth or untruth, it is love or hatred.

03:51.975 --> 03:54.889
Only through vibrations you can do.

03:55.583 --> 03:58.325
But going beyond that, I am saying,

03:59.325 --> 04:02.948
beyond that one has to know
what are these vibrations

04:03.895 --> 04:07.375
and what are they made of.

04:21.743 --> 04:27.380
What is the subtle force which is
behind those vibrations.

04:28.047 --> 04:31.869
We call it Paramchaitanya, alright.
Paramchaitanya, so what.

04:32.568 --> 04:36.843
What happens to you when you get Paramchaitanya,

04:36.869 --> 04:40.272
is something to be understood, the subtleties.

04:40.860 --> 04:46.359
As I said, we are made of five elements, alright?

04:46.710 --> 04:50.166
So when you get your awakening,
when the Kundalini reaches

04:50.191 --> 04:53.781
Sahasrara and opens out your fontanel bone area,

04:53.806 --> 05:02.071
you become one with the Divine power,
then this Divine power itself starts flowing through you.

05:02.940 --> 05:05.509
A connection is established.

05:06.029 --> 05:11.884
Now when it starts flowing through you, this
Shakti starts flowing through you,

05:13.202 --> 05:15.650
then what happens?

05:16.674 --> 05:20.046
The subtle part we should understand.

05:20.289 --> 05:27.052
The subtle part is like this, that these five
elements, we are made of,

05:27.147 --> 05:31.685
these vibrations gradually start breaking into

05:31.716 --> 05:35.947
the subtler form of which they are made.

05:36.365 --> 05:41.962
So the first thing such a person has
is the breaks, you see,

05:41.987 --> 05:46.406
as it is said that "Word is God."

05:47.279 --> 05:50.447
It's said also in the Bible, "The Word is God."

05:50.472 --> 05:52.520
Now what is this Word?

05:52.545 --> 06:01.142
Word is a silent, we can say, silent commandment.

06:01.340 --> 06:03.309
We can call it like that.

06:03.471 --> 06:07.983
But from that Word comes,
according to Indian Philosophy,

06:08.031 --> 06:12.094
is another thing that we call as "Bindu"...

06:17.179 --> 06:21.755
or we can say if Word becomes
Naad, is a sound...

06:21.874 --> 06:31.107
and then it becomes the Bindu means
one small dot, you can see

06:31.654 --> 06:34.243
and then from this dot...

06:34.473 --> 06:39.859
you see, all these five elements
start coming one after another.

06:40.153 --> 06:46.143
The first element that comes out is light...

06:47.643 --> 06:53.466
"Tej" light ... is the first element that comes out.

06:53.842 --> 06:58.855
So the essence of the first element is light.

07:01.522 --> 07:04.599
We call it Tej, Tejas.

07:04.704 --> 07:08.961
It is written, of course, in Sanskrit but we should understand

07:09.351 --> 07:14.752
that how the light pervades Sahaja Yoga so much

07:14.879 --> 07:17.977
and you see the light everywhere.

07:18.105 --> 07:23.168
So the first element which is light

07:23.249 --> 07:32.319
and you can say in English the light's subtle thing

07:32.344 --> 07:39.612
is, we can say, "enlightenment", you can say.

07:39.927 --> 07:46.331
But enlightenment has another meaning, so
we can say it is Tej, Tej.

07:46.633 --> 07:51.300
For example a person who gets realization has a face

07:51.325 --> 07:55.636
which is very radiant, so you can say the "radiance".

07:55.661 --> 08:01.271
The radiance is the subtlety of the light.

08:01.341 --> 08:05.195
So this radiance starts showing on your face.

08:05.306 --> 08:08.836
Radiance starts expressing itself

08:08.868 --> 08:14.674
and with that radiance people get impressed

08:14.699 --> 08:21.153
and they start thinking something special about
this personality which has a radiance.

08:21.178 --> 08:25.298
Now you have seen my photographs also wherever they are,

08:25.323 --> 08:28.687
many a times you find lots of light around.

08:28.712 --> 08:37.036
That is nothing but the light in me is giving radiance

08:37.073 --> 08:39.763
because the light becomes subtler.

08:40.048 --> 08:43.459
When the light becomes subtle in me, -- light,

08:43.531 --> 08:48.556
light is one of the elements -- when it becomes subtler

08:48.581 --> 08:58.117
then it gives radiance and so this is the
subtle growth within you that takes place.

08:58.287 --> 09:01.082
Your faces also start shining.

09:01.107 --> 09:10.083
They too have radiance and they too have a
kind of a different complexion, I would say.

09:10.693 --> 09:18.299
This radiance is to be understood, is the subtle of the light

09:18.629 --> 09:23.044
of which we are made, light in the gross manner.

09:23.813 --> 09:29.741
Then after this from the light comes the second thing,

09:29.766 --> 09:35.156
which we call as Vayu in Sanskrit, meaning the air.

09:35.394 --> 09:40.173
So the air that we have which is gross air,

09:40.198 --> 09:45.126
what is subtle of air is the "cool breeze" that you get.

09:45.190 --> 09:49.683
The cool breeze is the subtle of that air.

09:49.767 --> 09:57.127
So the subtle of what you understand as cool breeze is

09:57.175 --> 10:03.060
what we call vibrations, the subtle of that is air;

10:03.085 --> 10:07.034
which is a part and parcel of our making.

10:07.140 --> 10:15.183
So this cool breeze is the second thing that
you start getting subtler and subtler.

10:15.325 --> 10:21.880
When your growth takes place, all these subtle
things start expressing themselves.

10:21.905 --> 10:26.467
It is not only that you get vibrations
but you get the cool breeze

10:26.492 --> 10:31.555
and that is the subtler of air that has built you up.

10:34.556 --> 10:37.412
Then comes the Water.

10:37.967 --> 10:40.423
We are also made of water.

10:40.540 --> 10:45.570
What is the subtle of water is...

10:49.904 --> 10:54.003
sometimes English language,
you know, becomes little short of...

10:54.028 --> 10:59.161
especially but they call it...

10:59.209 --> 11:05.728
I mean which makes the skin, hard skin soft.

11:06.815 --> 11:09.691
The skin becomes soft.

11:11.310 --> 11:18.314
This is another sign of a realized soul that his...

11:20.148 --> 11:24.574
there is some cream they use, isn't it, to soften the face.

11:25.231 --> 11:35.291
But this is the water in us, gives us that
luster, that nourishment to make our skin

11:35.660 --> 11:40.401
very soft and that softness
of the skin becomes very visible.

11:40.517 --> 11:43.724
This is the minimum of minimum, I would say.

11:43.888 --> 11:52.426
But then a person who is a realized soul becomes
very soft person, very delicate.

11:52.451 --> 12:03.384
When he talks to some body, in his voice there
is warmth or I should say there is...

12:03.409 --> 12:14.874
[Mother speeks Hindi]... to have that flow,
watery flow and coolness of the water.

12:15.025 --> 12:22.135
So that is the another subtle thing that should
be expressed in your behavior, on your skin,

12:22.430 --> 12:30.381
on your dealings with others, that you should
be like the water, which is mobile,

12:30.504 --> 12:36.629
which is cooling, which is soothing, which is cleansing.

12:36.706 --> 12:43.986
So this also becomes a part and parcel of
your being, once you become a realized soul.

12:44.837 --> 12:51.598
With this water you have also another thing
which we call it as Agni, means the fire.

12:51.990 --> 12:56.450
So you also have fire but it is a very silent fire.

12:56.475 --> 13:01.465
It does not burn anybody but it burns all
the wrong things within you.

13:01.490 --> 13:04.026
Whatever wrong things you have it burns

13:04.051 --> 13:07.101
and it burns the wrong things in other people also.

13:07.126 --> 13:11.536
For example, a person comes
with a great anger towards me.

13:11.883 --> 13:19.373
What happens that this anger becomes cooldown
with the fire that is there.

13:19.660 --> 13:24.635
Moreover, a realized soul cannot get burnt,

13:24.660 --> 13:30.577
fire cannot burn, the burning cannot come to him.

13:30.831 --> 13:33.222
It is very important to understand.

13:33.247 --> 13:37.473
Also if you are doing something wrong,

13:37.522 --> 13:42.200
it may burn you but if you are a good Sahaja Yogi

13:42.225 --> 13:47.395
and I should say, perfect Sahaja Yogi,
fire will never burn you.

13:47.857 --> 13:54.505
We have an example of Sita Ji that she went
into the fire Pariksha... nothing burnt.

13:54.762 --> 14:01.202
So this is what one has to understand, that
once you get to the subtleties of the fire,

14:01.352 --> 14:08.820
so the fire and the water both of them
become sort of Divine.

14:09.130 --> 14:13.116
For example, the water which you touch,

14:13.149 --> 14:19.045
water you drink, whatever you put
your hand in the water,

14:19.070 --> 14:21.213
the water becomes vibrated.

14:21.238 --> 14:22.238
Means What?

14:22.553 --> 14:26.955
The subtleties of the water comes in it, the coolness,

14:26.980 --> 14:31.544
curing power also comes in that water.

14:31.759 --> 14:36.250
So when it becomes subtler,
all these powers start showing

14:36.275 --> 14:40.555
which you can see for yourself.
You do not have to experiment.

14:42.849 --> 14:49.520
Then the lastly is the Mother Earth... is
most important... is Mother Earth.

14:50.081 --> 14:55.089
There is a photograph you might see which
was taken in Russia in My Dacha

14:55.114 --> 14:58.239
where the Kundalini is in the Mother Earth.

14:58.264 --> 15:00.180
They have shown clearly.

15:00.418 --> 15:05.058
It is there and it is the Mother Earth which shows.

15:05.320 --> 15:11.428
For example, I have seen flowers, if you keep
them in my room, they blossom.

15:11.453 --> 15:13.990
They can become very big like that,

15:14.015 --> 15:18.494
never people have seen such big flowers,
sometimes they say.

15:18.519 --> 15:19.692
I am doing nothing.

15:19.717 --> 15:22.295
I am just sitting down and
what happens to the flowers?

15:22.320 --> 15:27.853
You see now there this principle of
the Mother Earth works...

15:27.878 --> 15:31.645
the subtle Mother Earth, is works, it's a mother.

15:31.796 --> 15:39.085
And that gives you all the nourishment and
makes you grow healthy,

15:39.302 --> 15:44.210
and this is how this subtlety works of the Mother Earth .

15:44.679 --> 15:50.407
Mother Earth is the one who is giver of virtue
to all these flowers

15:50.432 --> 15:55.646
and to all these trees and to all that,
but it also plays a big part in us.

15:55.671 --> 16:00.035
It is not only the Mother Earth that exists

16:00.060 --> 16:04.418
without our connection and we do not respect the Mother Earth.

16:04.443 --> 16:07.615
We have polluted it, we have done all kinds of things,

16:07.640 --> 16:13.040
we have removed the trees and we have made
a mess out of her, but she is our Mother

16:13.065 --> 16:16.678
and so many subtle things of this Mother Earth

16:16.703 --> 16:20.640
come into us. One of them is gravity.

16:20.953 --> 16:26.627
A person becomes very attractive, not in the physical sense

16:26.635 --> 16:29.603
but in the spiritual sense.

16:29.628 --> 16:32.668
Such a person attracts others.

16:32.990 --> 16:40.829
They feel attrackted and they feel that something
special is about this person.

16:41.128 --> 16:44.277
This is one of the qualities of the Mother Earth.

16:44.302 --> 16:50.125
If she had not kept us attracted we would
have fallen off with her movement

16:50.150 --> 16:54.330
and also other qualities of the Mother Earth also

16:54.355 --> 16:59.085
start manifesting within us, and we become very,

16:59.086 --> 17:06.588
I should say, extremely tolerant, patient... person.

17:06.613 --> 17:10.970
Tolerant and patient... extremely tolerant and patient.

17:10.995 --> 17:15.532
But if you are not tolerant, if you are hot
tempered and all that,

17:15.557 --> 17:19.209
then Mother Earth's principle is not expressed I should say.

17:19.234 --> 17:22.497
Look at the Mother Earth.
How much she tolerates our nonsense,

17:22.522 --> 17:27.854
how many wrong things we do against her,
but still she tolerates.

17:27.879 --> 17:31.573
Sri Ganesha's quality is to tolerate, to begin with.

17:31.598 --> 17:35.187
Up to a point, he tolerates.
In the same way,

17:35.212 --> 17:40.963
we too become extremely tolerant,
patient and forgiving.

17:41.368 --> 17:46.929
This is the minimum of minimum that should
happen to all the Sahajayogis who have vibrations,

17:46.954 --> 17:52.164
because now I have told you all the things
that are expressed in your vibrations.

17:52.189 --> 17:59.125
It is a thing to be understood that what you
have become now is something very great,

17:59.509 --> 18:06.616
it has not happened to others, it has not happened
to somebody who is not being a Sahaja Yogi.

18:06.641 --> 18:12.850
You see the people who go to Church or to
Mosques or to Temple, see their faces.

18:13.601 --> 18:15.880
Look at them, how do they look like?

18:15.905 --> 18:19.543
They haven't got anything from the Temple,
they haven't got anything

18:19.568 --> 18:27.119
from the Mosque, they haven't got anything from
any one of these places where they go to worship.

18:27.260 --> 18:29.293
So, that is artificial.

18:29.318 --> 18:36.605
That has become something, I should say, without
any connection with the reality.

18:36.630 --> 18:43.105
Only after realization you are connected with
reality and you can get

18:43.130 --> 18:50.027
the understanding of all these
subtleties working through you.

18:50.052 --> 18:55.375
Why I am telling you this, because I want
you to know and recognize yourself,

18:55.400 --> 18:58.656
to understand what you are, what you have got.

18:58.681 --> 19:04.275
Once you recognize yourself and understand
yourself you can do a lot.

19:04.300 --> 19:11.924
First of all to say that I am a Sahaja Yogi
itself it should be very much with self confidence

19:11.949 --> 19:16.746
and as a self confident person should find
out what have I done as Sahaja Yogi?

19:16.771 --> 19:18.479
What can I do as Sahaja Yogi?

19:18.504 --> 19:21.024
Some Sahaja Yogis have done wonders.

19:21.049 --> 19:27.382
They have done such a lot of work of Sahaja Yoga,
while some Sahaja Yogis are still writing to me

19:27.407 --> 19:34.080
that "my husband is fighting with me,
my son is like this, my mother like this";

19:34.080 --> 19:38.507
all the time, you see, letters after letters
come to me.

19:38.532 --> 19:41.167
You are a Sahaja Yogi.

19:41.349 --> 19:45.997
Now you just see to your subtleties, work it out.

19:46.031 --> 19:50.439
They think I am here to solve their problems,
their family problems,

19:50.464 --> 19:54.486
and their jobs and things.
I am not here for that.

19:54.511 --> 19:57.511
I am here to give you self-realization

19:57.536 --> 20:03.624
and the understanding that whatever you have got,
you must accept as a challenge,

20:03.664 --> 20:08.153
take it up as a challenge and you will be amazed,
how you will be helped

20:08.178 --> 20:10.514
and how you will get the results!

20:10.539 --> 20:15.647
"Sahaja" does not mean only
that you get spontaneous realization.

20:15.672 --> 20:18.316
It also means that you get spontaneity.

20:18.341 --> 20:20.660
The whole nature gets spontaneity.

20:20.685 --> 20:24.411
All these subtle things that I have told you,
they also get spontaneous

20:24.436 --> 20:26.289
and they work it out.

20:26.314 --> 20:30.962
Of course, there are Angels and there are
Ganas who are helping you

20:30.987 --> 20:33.654
but you need not worry about them just now.

20:33.679 --> 20:37.870
Main thing is you must realize what you are,
what have you got

20:37.895 --> 20:42.989
and how much you have faced it,
you have got it and how it has worked?

20:43.076 --> 20:50.460
I have seen every time I just have a little
problem of something, immediately it works.

20:51.773 --> 20:58.925
It works in such quarters and such people
that I never expected.

20:58.950 --> 21:00.814
Just  comes in.

21:00.839 --> 21:02.698
Everything works out.

21:02.895 --> 21:08.716
But whatever works out is for your good,
is for your growth,

21:08.741 --> 21:12.241
for your understanding that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

21:12.266 --> 21:17.465
You have entered into the Kingdom of God,
but this you have to develop.

21:17.474 --> 21:24.404
Also, introspection can tell you that are
you working out all those things or not?

21:24.429 --> 21:31.016
If you take to introspection, you will be
surprised to see, yes, you have these powers

21:31.132 --> 21:33.417
and you can do wonders.

21:33.481 --> 21:38.901
So I bless you all, please develop those subtle
things within you.

21:38.925 --> 21:41.672
They are already there; you do not
have to do anything.

21:41.697 --> 21:43.867
Only understand and locate.

21:43.892 --> 21:47.272
Thank you very much.
