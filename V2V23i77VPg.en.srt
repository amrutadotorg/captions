1
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,800
To all the seekers of truth I bow.

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,240
Dr. Reeves has spoken rather strongly today.

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,120
I think he is a very great Australian

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,160
to have that kind of a wisdom

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,360
to see through the nonsense and the mockery

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,000
that people were inflicting

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:37,000
on simple naive seekers from abroad.

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,040
It requires a great intelligence

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,360
and common sense to see through that.

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,160
But the greatest of all is the desire

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,840
to do good to others,

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,640
to be touched by the agonies of others,

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,680
to be upset what others are suffering.

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,720
This is the biggest thing,

15
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,960
that really brings you to the right point of understanding.

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,680
What he said is absolute truth.

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,600
I’ve been to all these gurus to find out what they have been up to.

18
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,320
And they have been telling everyone that “She was my disciple.”

19
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,840
Another said, “She was my disciple.”

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,960
I just wanted to find out

21
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,040
what are they doing to these people,

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,400
how are they grabbing them,

23
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,680
and what are they managing.

24
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,160
I knew the divine path, I knew the holy path, the pure path,

25
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,840
but I didn’t know the path of the crooks,

26
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,240
of the antichrist,

27
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,080
and actually I had to find it out Myself.

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,600
And that’s how I went to all these people

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,560
in a garb that “I have come to learn” — they never recognized Me.

30
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,200
What you do and all those things.

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,160
And that’s how I have been able to find out methods,

32
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,880
in the permutation, combinations of your barriers,

33
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,720
how to achieve en masse realization.

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,840
In the beginning of My life, I started with normal, common people,

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,520
intelligent people, educated people in all walks of life.

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,360
I had to go through various types of phases,

37
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,480
in which I met all types of people,

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,080
and I could, through My subtle methods,

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,640
find out what are the barriers.

40
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,360
But the worst of all,

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,040
which concerned Me the most of all,

42
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,320
was that the great seekers of the ancient times

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,200
have gone into such mesmerism,

44
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,480
into such ego-pampering processes

45
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,320
that how will they retreat back?

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,040
It was a big concern to Me.

47
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,720
I have tried —

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,280
after getting so many normal people first to Sahaja Yoga,

49
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,960
then to these combinations —

50
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,600
I must confess

51
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,960
that it is not easy to give realization to people

52
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,560
who have been to those gurus.

53
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,680
Day in and day out

54
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,720
I have to work out the permutations and combinations of barriers,

55
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,560
of terrible barriers within them.

56
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,800
It’s not an easy thing,

57
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,360
but, thank God, I have achieved it

58
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,240
by My own love and concern.

59
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,080
Still I must tell you: those who belong to some guru

60
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,720
are very difficult people for realization.

61
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,600
Last year in Melbourne

62
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,320
we had about, I think, fifty people like that,

63
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,760
and it was impossible to give them realization;

64
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,520
and they even tried their level best —

65
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,360
they found it difficult to get it,

66
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,400
while a drunkard could get it in no time,

67
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,880
an alcoholic could get it in no time,

68
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,200
a prostitute could get it in no time.

69
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,960
Can you imagine?

70
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,040
What harm is done within yourself

71
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,040
that it is not easy to give them realization!

72
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,080
And even if they get realization —

73
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,880
because they are so ego-oriented — they fall back.

74
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,480
They mock, that’s the only thing they can do.

75
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,720
They are least bothered about their own realization.

76
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,480
They are not bothered. They are identified with that idea

77
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,000
that they belong to some sort of a cult,

78
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,760
and they always try to be with them.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,640
Even in Perth we went, then in Adelaide,

80
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,560
I found these, some of them, are paid by gurus

81
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,560
to come and disturb us.

82
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,520
To that extent these people, who are seekers of God, are going down.

83
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,800
They have no eyes, no sensitivity to feel what is the truth.

84
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,600
And they are not bothered about their own well-being.

85
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,720
This is the worst thing that is happening to them.

86
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,600
It’s a thing of concern. Every time I have an interview anywhere —

87
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,240
in Australia, America, anywhere — they ask Me such questions

88
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,640
that “Why not your government stops these things?

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,480
Why not your government do something about these people?

90
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,280
They have amassed so much of money.”

91
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,000
This Muktananda now, we have learnt, officially, he has got

92
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,040
sixty thousand rupees worth of diamonds,

93
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,880
and both the disciples are fighting for it.

94
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Still, you see, it is impossible for people to accept

95
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,240
that “Whatever has happened has happened,

96
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,720
it’s a naiveness we went into. Let us get to the real thing.”

97
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,560
They just can’t think of it.

98
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,960
And anything that guru says, they listen to it,

99
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,080
not even logically think about it.

100
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,880
Moreover, if you talk to them, they don’t know anything about reality.

101
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Now, as you have seen Warren,

102
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,400
then you have seen William,

103
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,680
there are all these Sahaja Yogis who are equipped

104
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,040
with complete knowledge about Kundalini,

105
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,200
how to give realization and how to cure people, what are the problems.

106
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,600
I mean, William, I had never told him anything about it as such.

107
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,840
But he has given realization to so many people in your Melbourne.

108
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,640
So you start manifesting your own powers,

109
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,000
and you don’t live on some sort of an ego

110
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,800
that you belong to some cult or anything,

111
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,600
but you belong to yourself.

112
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,040
Every individual becomes a beautiful flower.

113
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,800
That’s what we have to expect within ourselves.

114
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,880
That’s what really you are seeking.

115
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,680
Not to be called into this guru or that guru

116
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,240
but your own guru within yourself — is your Spirit,

117
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,600
is the Shiva’s Spirit within you.

118
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,880
Today, of course, he has already told you

119
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,200
about these three centers which I would like to deal with you.

120
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,800
The first center that I dealt

121
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,760
and the second and third are very important,

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,640
but these higher centers

123
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,480
are playing a very vital role in our being.

124
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,480
The one which is the Heart center

125
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,600
is looking after

126
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,800
the security of God’s children.

127
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,840
When a person sees something horrible,

128
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,240
this center starts pulsating fast.

129
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,760
Till the age of twelve years,

130
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,240
the sternum bone, which is placed in the ribs here, as you know,

131
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,600
creates antibodies to fight any invasion within,

132
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,880
whether mental, emotional, or physical.

133
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,640
These antibodies get distributed, till the age of twelve years,

134
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:44,600
throughout your body.

135
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,600
And when this sternum gets the message,

136
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,440
it starts shaking,

137
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,840
and it conveys, communicates, through no …

138
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,040
nerves or arteries or veins — any connection known so far —

139
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,160
to these antibodies that they should all fight.

140
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,720
They fight the disease,

141
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:16,960
they fight also the things what you call possessions.

142
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,640
They also fight your own mistakes.

143
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:29,720
That’s why this is a very important center within us.

144
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,200
If a lady is an insecure woman,

145
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,440
if she feels insecure,

146
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,960
then this center is always in a pulsating mood.

147
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,160
And that’s how it makes all the antibodies very tired,

148
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,560
because they are all the time in a state of emergency.

149
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,320
Also these cults have used

150
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,880
this method of putting people onto emergency:

151
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,120
give them exercises where they jump, jump, jump, or something like that.

152
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,680
Now, you can ask any doctor,

153
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,360
this kind of jumping without any support

154
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,960
can create impotency in a personality.

155
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,360
Now, this is very physically used method by these people,

156
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,560
to make them nervous

157
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,560
by making this center go very fast.

158
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,800
Now, when these antibodies are tired,

159
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,560
they become absolutely numbed down,

160
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,720
and they cannot find any strength to fight any aggression.

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,480
Now, in everyday life also,

162
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,240
if some lady, as I told you, is nervous,

163
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,320
and she has problem, and she’s always afraid,

164
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,440
then what happens — that this system

165
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,120
starts exerting itself too much;

166
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,720
ultimately it gets sick,

167
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,960
and then she can develop a disease called the breast cancer.

168
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,560
This breast cancer is very common nowadays

169
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,720
among women in the West.

170
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,120
Because the motherhood of the lady is challenged.

171
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,320
This center is bestowed upon

172
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,640
by the deity of Mother of the Universe.

173
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:37,840
And when the lady finds that her motherhood is challenged,

174
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,400
then she starts feeling very nervous,

175
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,600
this center goes into over-activity,

176
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,600
and then she developed this cancer of the breast,

177
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,800
troubles of the breast, all kinds of such troubles.

178
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,640
Because the antibodies have become now very weak.

179
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,040
On the left-hand side of this center

180
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,120
is the center what we call as the left Heart center.

181
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:20,360
But beyond that is residing the Spirit,

182
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,840
in your heart, in the organ, separated from everyone.

183
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:32,400
The Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty within yourself.

184
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,080
And the Kundalini is the Holy Ghost,

185
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,960
which is the Power of God,

186
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,600
which is the Primordial Mother,

187
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,160
expressed within you as the Kundalini.

188
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,120
So we have got within us that power, shakti,

189
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,440
and the Shiva, sitting in your heart.

190
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:06,040
So this Kundalini has to rise to give you realization.

191
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,840
The baptism, the real baptism. Not an artificial one.

192
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:18,040
Now, how it can happen in a person is a problem.

193
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,720
It used to happen. What knowledge I am telling you

194
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,520
is not the knowledge of today.

195
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,080
Is the knowledge of very very ancient times.

196
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,840
Fourteen thousand years back,

197
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:34,040
Markandeya, a great poet in India, has written about it.

198
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,680
After that

199
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,960
there were many other poets who wrote about it,

200
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,840
till, in the sixth century, Adi Shankaracharya

201
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,880
very clearly wrote about the Kundalini and its awakening.

202
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,160
Nobody has said so far,

203
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,560
from those ancient writers, that Kundalini gives you any problems,

204
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,360
or she makes you dance, jump and all that — is all modern nonsense.

205
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,480
Traditionally, nobody has said so.

206
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,080
Sixth century is the time

207
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,640
when Adi Shankaracharya incarnated on this earth.

208
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Buddha got His realization without doing any dancing or anything.

209
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,600
You know for definite.

210
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,320
So this new idea of all these happenings

211
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,320
come by a generation of these horrible people

212
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,600
in the last fifty years.

213
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,160
I would say there has been a Holy Trinity

214
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,000
as well as a Unholy Trinity.

215
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,080
These people preceded the others who were to come,

216
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,040
to execute what they wanted to do.

217
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,880
These antichrists had two type of things,

218
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,800
because … how to neutralize also the writings of the ancient times.

219
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,680
Like Freud — was one of them.

220
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,240
There are some more. They came down like this

221
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,400
and wrote some things to uproot human beings completely,

222
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,640
first of all, from reality.

223
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,480
And then another lot came in

224
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,520
for using that as a written thing for them —

225
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,040
because writing is something great —

226
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,240
and then preaching what these people have preached,

227
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,640
using that as a base to express themselves.

228
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,560
You see, all hand-in-gloves knowledge.

229
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,880
But if you read any ancient book —

230
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,680
which many are not translated…

231
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,640
Because nobody’s interested in that!

232
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,080
They diverted all our attention from the sublime

233
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,600
to absolutely wretched life.

234
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
And this uprooting has taken place

235
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,680
because these are antichrist activities;

236
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,840
they are all joined together, they never talk against each other,

237
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,000
that’s one thing great about them.

238
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,440
And Christ has said

239
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,160
that Satan is not going to talk against his own house.

240
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,520
They praise each other, meet each other,

241
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,480
I’ve seen them behaving like that.

242
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,800
Give them presents, this one gives presents to another —

243
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,200
big fraternity exists between them.

244
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,760
Great fraternity, no problem between them.

245
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,160
But the real saints in India,

246
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,640
who are living in the forest and Himalayas,

247
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,520
into the hills and dales, I should say,

248
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,680
hidden away from … you people,

249
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:52,400
are just quite aware that these are antichrist.

250
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,160
The first thing that happened when these people

251
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,800
started manifesting themselves — India is very good at astrology,

252
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,720
so, as soon as their birth date came in, they just cast their… horoscope

253
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,800
and said, “Now let’s see what’s in their horoscope.”

254
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,680
So, most of them changed their birth dates also.

255
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,600
Nothing consistent!

256
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,200
And when you ask them, “Why are you not consistent?”

257
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,320
they said change is the way the life is.

258
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,280
But that is life. You are talking of something eternal.

259
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,640
How can eternal change?

260
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,600
It’s very difficult

261
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,480
to make people take to eternal life

262
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,800
than to make them take to just mundane life. You know that.

263
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,760
Now, see, there’s a show on today. How many cars there are!

264
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,360
And how many people there are to see that!

265
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,000
But to take to real life, it takes time,

266
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,680
otherwise why is it all the great saints

267
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,080
and all the great prophets and incarnations

268
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,520
were tortured by human beings?

269
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,680
Why did they torture them?

270
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,800
So this is one of the things one has to realize —

271
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,600
that the Spirit resides in your heart.

272
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,000
Which is the Sat-chit-ananda, as they say —

273
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,440
is the one which is the truth,

274
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,840
which is the attention,

275
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,400
and which is the joy.

276
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,040
Now, first of all, we must understand what is attention.

277
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,680
What is “God who is an attention”, what does that mean.

278
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,800
“God who is the attention” means

279
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:47,160
God knows about everything that’s happening.

280
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,520
He is aware of what is happening in this world.

281
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:59,560
He's the only spectator of the drama of life,

282
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,400
which is created by His Power, the Primordial Mother.

283
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,800
He knows each and everything about us;

284
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,160
whatever He wants to know, He can find out,

285
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,840
there is no problem about it.

286
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,600
So He is the knower,

287
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,160
and He is the knowledge too.

288
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,080
So, when we become realized,

289
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,560
we have to know through our awareness:

290
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,760
we have to become collectively conscious.

291
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,400
And this is a very important point which we must remember.

292
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,560
It’s not very difficult to understand

293
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,640
that you have to become something more.

294
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,760
Only by wearing some dress

295
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,200
or putting something in your neck what do you become?

296
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,360
Some people tell Me, “We lead a very good life, Mother,

297
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,520
so it should be all right.”

298
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,600
But “good life” is according to your concept.

299
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,440
Even according to the divine concept,

300
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,440
if it is a good life — for what?

301
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,360
Everybody will ask, “For what?

302
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,440
Why do you want to lead such a religious life, for what?

303
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,600
What is the need to have such a life?”

304
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,960
One should ask oneself, “Why to lead such a life

305
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,160
which is so conditioned?”

306
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,200
The answer is, you have to have balance to ascend.

307
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,960
If you do not ascend, what’s the use

308
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,360
of building up this balance within you?

309
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,960
The purpose is to ascend.

310
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,360
If you cannot transcend,

311
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,600
then this is just a binding, your mental projection

312
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,360
that you should lead this kind of life and that kind of life.

313
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,000
It’s just your mental process.

314
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,440
But when the Spirit ascends,

315
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,800
then all the religions are born within you.

316
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,600
They get enlightenment. You just don’t do things which are wrong.

317
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,880
Just don’t do it, you just don’t like it.

318
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,240
As we have told you that there are people who gave up

319
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,960
their drugs and things overnight. Is a fact!

320
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,040
Because, as soon as this happens,

321
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,000
the enlightenment brings forth

322
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,800
complete new awareness

323
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,640
which refuses to have anything that is not good for this body.

324
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,840
You just have the things that are good for your body, for your life.

325
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,880
You don’t have to fight with yourself

326
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,600
that “Oh God, how will I give up?” In the morning you say,

327
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,440
“I will not drink in the night,” but in the night you drink.

328
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,960
So, in the beginning there is no need in Sahaja Yoga today

329
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,200
to say that “Don’t do this and don’t do that.”

330
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,000
There’s no need at all.

331
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,560
Once it is enlightened within you, you just look after yourself.

332
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,200
But when the Spirit starts coming in your attention,

333
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,160
you become collectively conscious, and you know.

334
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,240
You know, again. It’s not mental projection.

335
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,720
You know about yourself.

336
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,760
You know what centers are catching, on your fingers you can tell.

337
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,720
Fingertips, you can say. You know on your fingertips.

338
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,040
And you know about others also.

339
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,880
And also, if you really learn the complete technique —

340
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:27,280
which is very easy to learn, within a week you can learn it —

341
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,360
you can help another and yourself very well

342
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,400
to rise above this level to a higher level.

343
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,480
People have all kinds of fears these days.

344
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,680
It’s a very abnormal situation.

345
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,360
They don’t have any joy. Only fear. They live with fear.

346
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,840
They were telling Me there’s a person who cannot live out

347
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,600
in the space, then there’s fear of even building bad oxygen,

348
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,960
then they have fear of germ touching them,

349
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,960
and all those things are there. They have lost confidence in life.

350
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,160
By awakening of this center within you,

351
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,160
you become absolutely a normal person.

352
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,160
You have no fears.

353
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,800
Because nothing that is wrong can attack you.

354
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,440
You are well prepared for it.

355
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,280
There’s a strength within you which really

356
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,440
makes you very confident.

357
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,040
That’s why this center is very important

358
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,040
for us to know that this center

359
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,880
gives us that strength, that confidence.

360
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,600
The other day — every program —

361
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,840
they asked Me another question:

362
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,640
“What do You think about Australians?”

363
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,600
Which is a very very common question, I’ve found.

364
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,720
I said that they are great people, very nice people.

365
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,000
But they lack only one thing — is complete confidence in themselves.

366
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,280
They haven’t got that confidence that they should have.

367
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,240
They are not aggressive people, they are not worried

368
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,960
about aggressing other territories or anything.

369
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,960
But a kind of a diffidence is still in them

370
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,640
which they should get rid of it. Completely.

371
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,480
You are the people who belong to God.

372
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,560
And why should you have any diffidence about it?

373
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,240
But this diffidence

374
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,120
is completely finished

375
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,640
when you get this center awakened within you.

376
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,480
To get this center awakened, you have to do nothing.

377
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,000
The Kundalini herself rises,

378
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,040
and if you have any problem in that center, she comes back;

379
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,720
again she rises with a greater force and hits there,

380
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,960
opens it out and awakens the deity of that center,

381
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,240
so that you feel very confident.

382
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,000
Today, if you see, Dr. Warren so confident.

383
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,200
I must tell you, he was not,

384
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,480
he was quite diffident.

385
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,200
He thought you all are going to beat him

386
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,840
when he tells you all these things.

387
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,520
But today he’s a changed man.

388
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,760
Now, we have on the right-hand side of this,

389
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,440
is another part of the center, which we call as right Heart.

390
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,960
This center is the father’s center,

391
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,720
and the left Heart is the mother’s center.

392
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:37,040
So, if your fatherhood is challenged in any way —

393
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,280
or, also, husband-wise, we can say it like that —

394
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,720
if a husband is not loyal to his wife

395
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,680
and is playing tricks with her,

396
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,240
he gets this into trouble.

397
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,040
But physically, he feels it very much

398
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,600
because he gets asthma.

399
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,080
Asthma one develops,

400
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,680
but this is more a center of the father.

401
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,280
If the fatherhood of a person is not all right,

402
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,880
for example, if a girl has lost her father

403
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,560
and she has never seen him, she might develop asthma.

404
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,880
If the grandfather had the asthma,

405
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,000
the grandchild might develop the asthma.

406
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,640
It comes from the father’s side.

407
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:31,200
Anybody who has asthma problem should know

408
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,400
that there's something wrong in the fatherhood side.

409
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,400
Maybe the father is sick and you are worried,

410
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,800
maybe you are a good father, but the son is not all right,

411
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,520
so you are suffering — anything like that, you see,

412
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,640
could be responsible for this asthma.

413
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,600
But if the deity here is awakened, you can be all right,

414
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,680
and you can get rid of your asthma, quite all right.

415
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,400
On the left-hand side is the center of your mother.

416
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,440
If the mother has died very early,

417
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,480
such a person is a nervous person,

418
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,640
and such a person also doesn’t trust anyone.

419
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,120
He can become secretive by nature, sulking type.

420
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,440
He may not open his heart to anyone, because he doesn’t trust anyone.

421
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,080
Some people who have no mother,

422
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,960
whom they have not known,

423
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,320
can become extremely cautious by nature

424
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,600
because they think they have to look after themselves.

425
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,360
Extremely cautious.

426
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:42,200
But with Sahaja Yoga, you can awaken this center,

427
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,640
and you become a complete personality,

428
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,800
without any fear, without any nervousness,

429
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,960
and without any malice to your parents.

430
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,240
Actually, after Sahaja Yoga, I’ve found,

431
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,440
many people who have just forgotten their parents,

432
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,080
had been very angry with their parents,

433
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,040
given them up, could not forgive them —

434
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,160
went back to their parents.

435
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,600
We had a French girl in England

436
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,120
who had not seen her mother for eighteen years,

437
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,360
and the mother was alone, a widow lady.

438
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,800
But after the realization, she has a tremendous feeling;

439
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,000
she went back and looked after her mother,

440
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,200
and also started doing Sahaja Yoga there.

441
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,560
It’s not … it’s a very very common thing

442
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,400
that you start expanding your heart to others.

443
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,560
You start loving other people,

444
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,160
you start understanding them.

445
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:41,120
I know of a man in America — I gave him realization —

446
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,600
and he said, “Most surprising, I went to the race this time.

447
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,360
I said this would be the last I go to the race.

448
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,720
And there I find my uncle, and I wished him;

449
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,080
and he was amazed, he started looking at me,

450
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,800
because I had not wished him all these years at all.

451
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,680
He just started, he was quite amazed at my attitude.

452
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,960
And now he has become a great friend of mine.”

453
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,840
So the friendship —

454
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,600
which is a pure friendship, this homosexual and all nonsense —

455
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:12,840
but a pure friendship based on pure relationship develops.

456
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,200
And then you don’t feel insecure.

457
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,640
In a society where even a mother’s love is challenged,

458
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,000
one would feel extremely insecure in a thing like that.

459
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,480
If a mother has to love the child, she has to think,

460
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,800
“I hope there is no bad feeling in my mind.”

461
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,360
In America it happened: there was a little boy of eight years,

462
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,560
just a little boy of eight years.

463
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,680
And her mother said that she has started taking

464
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,760
lot of drugs and things,

465
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,320
and these drugs have created a problem

466
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,360
for this little boy of eight years, can you imagine?

467
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,640
So I couldn’t bear it, I just took the boy to My heart,

468
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,560
and I kissed him.

469
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,560
He said, “Mother, this is never done to me by my mother.”

470
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,440
So I asked the lady, “Why didn’t you do this to your child?

471
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,000
He’s only eight years of age, doesn’t he love your care,

472
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,320
and your expression of your love?”

473
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,560
So she said, “Mother, I feel guilty.” I said, “How?” —

474
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,320
“Freud has said…” Freud was a perverted useless fellow!

475
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,400
He died of cancer, look at his life!

476
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:29,720
These psychologists, when they come in contact with others,

477
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,360
people who are suffering from pathological troubles —

478
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,280
they are pathological cases —

479
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,480
and when they deal with pathological cases,

480
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,680
they don’t know how to protect them. Jung has said about it.

481
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,600
Then they catch those diseases among themselves,

482
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,120
and they start generalizing this for everyone.

483
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,200
They have generalized, it’s an absurd thing!

484
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,800
In Rome, there was a girl who came to Me, she said,

485
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,360
“Ah, psychologists, horrid, horrid, horrid!”

486
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,680
I said, “What happened?” — “They are telling me I have bad eyes

487
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,280
towards my father. I felt like beating them!”

488
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,080
It's all absurd things, you see, to create — this is anti-Christ —

489
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,520
to create a feeling of enmity,

490
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,480
that everything is perverted, polluted.

491
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,560
It’s so pure!

492
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,120
In India nobody can understand this.

493
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,040
Thank God this Freud and all these people just touched

494
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,520
the periphery of India, and it’s like an elephant:

495
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,680
so nobody is there, and it’s just gone … nobody believes in it.

496
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,240
So, I have to tell you this, that there is no such thing

497
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,240
as polluted relationship or bad relationship.

498
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,720
It’s all pure relationships.

499
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,200
We must understand we are not animals.

500
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,880
Even animals have got sense, so do you think we won’t have

501
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:53,880
the sense of purity within us and holiness within us?

502
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,520
So all these ideas also drop out completely,

503
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,080
and you develop a personality.

504
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,120
You live with others: in the ashram now we have

505
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,600
many girls, boys, this — they’re all are like brothers and sisters.

506
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,640
There is no problem on that.

507
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,280
Now, we have the other centre,

508
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,360
which we call as the Vishuddhi Chakra.

509
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,440
This is a very very important center

510
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,880
which is bestowed upon by Shri Krishna Himself.

511
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,320
The right Heart by Shri Rama, and left Heart by Uma,

512
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,720
or we can call Her the wife of Shiva;

513
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,840
while the centre Heart is bestowed upon by the Mother,

514
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,800
called Jagadamba, who is the one

515
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:41,480
who helps people to cross this ocean of illusion,

516
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,520
and to protect them. This is the Divine Mother.

517
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,240
The other day you were asking Me about Divine Mother —

518
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,240
this is one of the glimpse of Her.

519
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,640
So now the other center which we have here

520
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,120
is very important center, called as the Vishuddhi Chakra.

521
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,280
This is the center Vi-shuddha. One is “shuddha”, means “pure”,

522
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,200
but “vishuddha” means “absolutely pure”.

523
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,640
This has got sixteen petals,

524
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:11,280
as we have got the cervical plexus expressed in the gross,

525
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,240
which has also got sixteen sub-plexuses.

526
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,640
It tallies with medical science completely.

527
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,360
Now, this Vishuddhi Chakra is bestowed upon

528
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,480
by the deity of Shri Krishna.

529
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,960
Shri Krishna is the one which is the evolution

530
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,800
of the Vishnu Tattwa [Vishnu Principle] from there

531
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:39,040
upward to the state of Primordial Being.

532
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,640
He is the one who resides

533
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:47,720
as the Primordial Being, as the Whole, as the Akbar.

534
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,520
When Mohammed Sahib talked of Akbar, he talked of Shri Krishna.

535
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,160
This is the finger which represents this center,

536
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,640
and He said: “Put these into your ears

537
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,200
and say ‘Allah hu Akbar’ —

538
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,760
you get in connection with the Virat.”

539
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,600
Now, what Sahaja Yoga does is to make you

540
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:13,680
in contact with the whole.

541
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,320
It makes you in contact with the whole.

542
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,520
It’s not that it limits you,

543
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,600
but it makes you one with the whole.

544
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,680
So one must understand

545
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:27,000
that what you have to achieve in your realization

546
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,800
is just not talk of Shri Krishna, just thinking, singing about —

547
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,440
which is absurd! People don’t understand!

548
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,880
That in Oxford Street we find people

549
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,240
with all these nonsensical things going on;

550
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,760
begging, asking for alms…

551
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,400
I feel it’s such an insult to Shri Krishna

552
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,040
that people in His name are begging.

553
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,200
But it’s done in all religious movements

554
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,960
that people beg in the name of God.

555
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,640
There is no need to beg.

556
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,680
First you equip yourself with the blessings of God

557
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,280
that there is no need for you to beg at all.

558
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,600
And begging is against God’s realization,

559
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,560
against Self-realization.

560
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,560
You must have self-esteem. That’s one thing very important.

561
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,680
If you do not have self-esteem, you cannot get realization.

562
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,120
Why should you go on the streets and beg?

563
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,520
It's absolutely absurd, it's a showing-off thing,

564
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,600
which is of no use to yourself.

565
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,120
By doing this, you are really corrupting the name of Shri Krishna.

566
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,960
But if you take to the right path,

567
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,080
if this center is awakened,

568
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,320
your hands become connected with the Primordial Being,

569
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,040
and you become, your hands become collectively conscious.

570
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,800
Medically, they accept that the extremities

571
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,120
have got something to do with the sympathetic nervous system.

572
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,600
That far, no more than that.

573
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,160
But in Sahaja Yoga, you’ll be amazed

574
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,960
that the vibration starts flowing through your hand

575
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,200
when you take the name of Shri Krishna.

576
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,120
And these vibrations, when you want to find out what are these,

577
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,280
then you’ll be amazed they relate to your centers within yourself.

578
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,320
Even if you get ten children who are realized souls,

579
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,600
and tie their eyes, and ask them about a person

580
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,000
who is sitting before them what’s wrong with him,

581
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,160
they will say one finger, or this finger,

582
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,120
or this finger, or two fingers.

583
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,480
Because you can feel the charring,

584
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,400
you can feel sometimes a kind of a heat.

585
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,120
Sometimes you may feel the numbness.

586
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,560
If you feel the numbness on your fingers,

587
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,480
then you must know that the person has to die.

588
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,840
So many things you can know, all the permutations

589
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,240
of these seven centers and this one:

590
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,600
one, five, and … six and seven.

591
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,800
So we have seven centers.

592
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,880
To understand about the centers,

593
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,120
first you must get your realization, that is important.

594
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,240
In the beginning you’ll find the vibrations are coming, going,

595
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,960
coming, going. It is not steady.

596
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,680
First you must steady yourself.

597
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,520
Then you can find out, from your hands,

598
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,560
what are the centers catching.

599
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,360
Because these vibrations are nothing

600
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,640
but the Power of God is flowing through you.

601
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,440
They understand, these vibrations, they co-ordinate.

602
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,960
They are life’s force.

603
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,760
They are the one who create all these living things

604
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,360
like … they are the one who sprout a seed,

605
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:39,480
they are the one who transform the flower into a fruit.

606
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,800
All living work is done by these vibrations,

607
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,640
which is called as Chaitanya, Aum, Ruh,

608
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:52,120
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, and all-pervading Power of God.

609
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,480
That starts flowing through you, first time you feel them.

610
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,520
Yesterday many people felt it, and people were very happy

611
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,440
that so many felt it, because that’s a sign

612
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:06,600
that here many people are going to get realization.

613
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,680
You don’t have to go to anybody,

614
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,120
you have to just practice a little bit and find out.

615
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,800
You’ll become such an expert!

616
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,560
One person in India who got realization

617
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,440
has so far given realization to at least ten thousand people.

618
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,640
In a village. Many villages.

619
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,320
He’s a very ordinary man. We wanted him to come,

620
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,800
but there was a kind of a visa problem, so he could not come.

621
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,880
He’s a very simple farmer, and he got his realization,

622
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,360
and he knows so much about Sahaja Yoga that you’ll be amazed;

623
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,880
he has not been to any university, to any college or anything,

624
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,560
but he’s so knowledgeable.

625
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,320
Because once you have these vibrations they guide you.

626
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,800
So the Spirit sitting in your heart

627
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,760
guides you and tells you what is right and what is wrong.

628
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,480
If you have to ask a question: “Mother, is there God?” —

629
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,320
if you ask this question, immediately there will be

630
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,080
a tremendous flow saying that it is there.

631
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,560
Now, how to understand that these are the vibrations of God,

632
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,600
also this question can come.

633
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,720
We can judge them relatively.

634
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,200
For example, in one of the programs in Pune,

635
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,600
people invited Me to speak

636
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,000
in a place which was owned by brahmins, and they opposed it.

637
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,400
They said, “She’s not a brahmin, so we will not have her here.”

638
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,440
So they said, “All right, we’ll publish in the newspaper —

639
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,000
because Her name has gone in the newspaper — we’ll tell them

640
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,280
that these people are so ‘brahminic’ that they don’t want to have Her.”

641
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,440
Of course, they didn’t want to have that bad name,

642
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,480
so they said, “All right, let’s have her.”

643
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,120
These people never told Me what had happened.

644
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,600
Suddenly I said, “Those who think who are brahmins, come down.”

645
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,560
So four-five of them came and sat before Me.

646
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,160
These are brahmins without knowing the Brahma!

647
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,360
So I said, “All right, put your hands before Me.”

648
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:02,080
And they just started shaking like this, going back.

649
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,040
I said, “What’s happening to you?”

650
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,560
So they said, “Mother, you are Shakti,

651
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,400
that’s why it is happening to me, to us,”

652
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,080
but I said, “What about others? It’s not happening to others.”

653
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,640
So they turned round and said, “Look at these,

654
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,960
they are also doing like this.”

655
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,960
I said, “Ask them from where do they come.”

656
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,680
They went and asked them; they said, “We are coming

657
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,560
from the lunatic asylum of Thane.”

658
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,520
So these fanatics, who believed that they were brahmins,

659
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:29,360
were reacting the same way as these lunatics.

660
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,440
And they believed that they were brahmins,

661
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,360
they were not supposed to touch anybody,

662
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,040
they were “untouchables” people, and they were …

663
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,600
the one who gave them realization was from so-called untouchable,

664
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,480
a shoemaker.

665
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,800
Now he’s become their guru, of all these brahmins,

666
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,080
and he’s teaching them about God.

667
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,520
So this center gives you the power

668
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,080
to be one with the whole.

669
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,120
It has many powers, but the main power it gives you

670
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,200
is the power to be one with the whole

671
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,400
and to have all the powers of that deity within you awakened,

672
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,400
so that you can become aware

673
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,960
and make others also aware of it.

674
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,440
Those people who talk too much catch on the right Vishuddhi,

675
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,680
those who do not talk at all catch on the left.

676
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,400
Those who feel guilty catch on the left,

677
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,640
those who think they are all right and aggressive,

678
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,960
they catch on the right. It’s like that.

679
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,000
So this has to be understood in right perspective:

680
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:38,280
that if you misuse this center, what happens to you,

681
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,440
so how you should give yourself a balance to improve that.

682
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,200
But the best part of Sahaja Yoga is this:

683
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,720
that when you get them realization,

684
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,640
they are separated from themselves.

685
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,800
They’ll come and tell Me, “Mother, my Agnya Chakra is catching.”

686
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,520
So, if you ask them, “Really?” — “Yes, Mother, very much.”

687
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,640
That means they are suffering from too much ego.

688
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,480
But can you imagine anybody saying,

689
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,560
“Mother, I’m suffering from too much ego”?

690
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,880
Because you are separated from yourself, you see your ego,

691
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,600
the big balloonic-like thing,

692
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,360
and you say, “Mother, please remove my ego.”

693
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,360
That is how people talk to Me.

694
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,240
They will tell Me: “Mother, I talk too much,

695
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,280
that’s why my right Vishuddhi is catching.

696
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,160
You better cure it, I must stop my talking too much.”

697
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,960
So you start correcting yourself

698
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,560
because you get separated from yourself,

699
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,760
you become the Spirit; and the rest you see.

700
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,480
Like I see My sari: if there’s a spot,

701
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,600
I would like to clean it, I’m not identified with the spot.

702
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,600
So, that’s how it happens; you are no more identified with yourself,

703
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,280
and you start seeing the faults in you, and you try to correct it.

704
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:46,840
That’s how you become a beautiful person — by your own attention,

705
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,240
not by anybody else, it is you who has to do it.

706
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:55,600
Now, we have a very important center here

707
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,440
called as Agnya Chakra.

708
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,600
This is bestowed upon

709
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:06,080
by the great incarnation of Lord Jesus Christ.

710
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,120
We have no idea as to how this incarnation

711
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,240
has come on this earth.

712
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,120
Because if you just read Bible, it is a little bit of Christ we see.

713
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,200
They allowed Him to live only for about four years

714
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,040
to talk to people; within four years He was killed.

715
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,000
So He had no time to tell you all about it.

716
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,160
But He did the job what He was supposed to do

717
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,600
and which He achieved in His lifetime.

718
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,160
But if you read some books,

719
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,960
in other scriptures like Devi Mahatmyam,

720
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,160
where the Goddess was the one who created Him —

721
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,600
and how She created, and what She did to Him,

722
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,840
and everything is given in detail —

723
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:57,120
and in every detail, you’ll be surprised, is the life of Christ.

724
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,240
Only thing, there He is called as Mahavishnu and not as Christ.

725
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,440
But even the name of Christ comes to Him

726
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,120
from the same heritage which I was telling you:

727
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,880
that His name was Yeshu, not Jesus,

728
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,840
because, in the Bible, I get Myself confused when I read

729
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:18,760
that Anna was not Anna, it was Hannah, John was Johann —

730
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,280
every name has been corrupted in the English Bible.

731
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,960
In the same way they have corrupted Christ’s name, Yeshu, into Jesus.

732
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:30,240
Actually, they call Him — some people, of course — call Him Jesu.

733
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:34,120
This is the name given to Him by Shri Radhaji,

734
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,400
the one who was the power of Shri Krishna.

735
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,880
She's the one who gave Him this name

736
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,240
because She was very much indebted

737
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,760
to the foster mother of Shri Krishna, who was Yeshoda,

738
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,880
and that’s why She called Him Yeshu.

739
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:52,840
“Yeshu” is the word in Hebrew language,

740
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:55,080
and we call Yeshoda as Yeshu;

741
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,120
also some people, in a … what you call … in a country language,

742
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,240
also call the same thing as Jesu.

743
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,600
You know that Y and J is always sort of

744
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,840
brought together in that way: like Yugoslavia, we call it —

745
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,680
they call it Jugoslavia.

746
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,720
So His name Yeshu came from that,

747
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,960
and that’s how He was created a special one.

748
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,960
In the Devi Mahatmyam it is said that Krishna has said

749
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,440
that “You will become the support of the universe.”

750
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,320
Now, in India, people and seers were waiting for Mahavishnu

751
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:33,560
to come and tell them that, Mahavishnu has been born.

752
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,000
But the people who went to India,

753
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,040
they had Bible in one hand and the pistol in another hand,

754
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,200
or a big gun, or maybe a huge big cannon.

755
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,160
And that’s how they entered India,

756
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:48,080
and they said that “You must get converted.”

757
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,000
Now, what is a “conversion” God only knows. You can take a donkey

758
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,040
and put a thing on that “You are a Christian” —

759
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,880
you don’t become a Christian.

760
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:57,360
That’s how they spread Christianity throughout India,

761
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,840
which was all absurd type of Christianity.

762
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,440
I was also born in one of the Protestant Christian families.

763
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,440
My father was a realized soul, My mother was another,

764
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,360
they were very learned people.

765
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:13,360
And My father told Me, “God, look at this now,

766
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:16,000
what are these Christians doing to Christ!”

767
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,880
And he was the one who fought for Independence,

768
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,960
he went to jail, My mother went to jail, and he was member

769
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,880
of our constituent assembly, parliament and all that,

770
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,520
but Christians only started recognizing him

771
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:33,160
when he became a member of something or a mayor of a place.

772
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,240
They had no other idea of a person,

773
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,160
that somebody has Spiritual endowment

774
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,320
or any sort of a Spiritual powers.

775
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,120
Now, in our family,

776
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:47,440
we were very much with Gandhiji, all of us;

777
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,880
we had sacrificed a lot for the country,

778
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,400
and My father decided to marry us all out of community,

779
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,640
not among Christians, because he thought these Christians

780
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,240
are so much worshipping these missionaries:

781
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,720
they would even pray for their health,

782
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,280
the health of their dog, and health of their umbrellas.

783
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:10,320
It was such a wretched condition of these Christians in those days;

784
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,400
I mean, they were so dedicated to these missionaries.

785
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,840
The missionaries were only busy converting people.

786
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,280
Now, this Mahavishnu Tattwa — the one who was born as Christ —

787
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,120
was never understood, never told,

788
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,360
they never read anything about it they never found out.

789
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,560
So, Indians believed that so far Mahavishnu is not born,

790
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,800
and so it continued with the idea

791
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,080
that we have to still go on.

792
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,280
Because in the principle Mahavishnu it was written

793
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,480
that “Not only You will be the support of the universe,

794
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:47,120
but You will have such purity within You,” —

795
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:50,400
because He is the Omkara, He’s the Chaitanya,

796
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,080
He’s the vibrations, that’s why He could walk,

797
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,200
that’s why He was resurrected —

798
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,560
that it was said that when His Advent will come,

799
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,720
He will cross this path —

800
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,440
this is the cross, the resurrection part —

801
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,000
and, by His advancement,

802
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,560
He will be able to suck in

803
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:13,440
the ego and superego within you, the karmas,

804
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,240
the conditionings, the ego in you,

805
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,000
by which people will get their realization.

806
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,680
So Indians continued with the idea

807
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,560
that “We have to still pay for our karmas, Mahavishnu has not come.”

808
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:29,880
Because of misrepresentation.

809
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,840
Once I told them that Christ was Mahavishnu, you see,

810
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,880
thousands are getting realization because they believe in Mahavishnu,

811
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,200
they of course respect Christ very much, but they did not know

812
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,720
that He was Mahavishnu; if He’s Mahavishnu, it’s perfect!

813
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,000
And that’s how He was enlightened, and He got -

814
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,960
the people got their realization in no time.

815
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,600
Because they are educated in it, they know what it is.

816
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,280
You see, these missionaries just read some Bible

817
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,000
in some schools and all that and came down.

818
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,880
But they did not know how to correlate the whole thing.

819
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,400
You see, it cannot be truth just in Bible,

820
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,960
it has to be everywhere.

821
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,680
And that is what happened when they came down

822
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:13,880
and they told us something which was not Christ.

823
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,760
Now, this thing happens to us also:

824
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,200
that when Kundalini rises,

825
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,600
Christ is born within you here, He’s awakened within you.

826
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,600
And when He is awakened, the ego and superego both are sucked in,

827
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,800
and you get a space here;

828
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:33,200
and when you get that space here, the Kundalini shoots off,

829
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:38,240
and that’s how you feel the cool breeze on your head.

830
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:43,080
I have given at least seven lectures continuously on Christ

831
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,840
in a church called as Unity Church.

832
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,400
It was, again, the unity and fraternity

833
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:52,000
of all the horrible people.

834
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,520
They were preaching about Rajneesh, preaching about …

835
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,600
at least Rajneesh is antichrist, anybody can see.

836
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,960
When Christ has said: “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes” —

837
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,960
to that extent His purity has gone —

838
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,000
how can you accept Rajneesh as a guru for any Spirituality?

839
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,120
But they had books from all kinds of horrible people.

840
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,680
They had no books which were ancient books with them,

841
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,360
nothing, no knowledge of any kind!

842
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,760
Indians don’t depend — the real Indians, I mean,

843
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,640
not the westernized pseudo-Indians

844
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,480
who have been to Cambridge and Oxford —

845
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,960
but those who are real Indians don’t depend on these books:

846
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,800
they think it’s all trash that has come and will go away,

847
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,160
it has no meaning.

848
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:36,520
And they had all these books put there to destroy.

849
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,960
Really the unity within us lies —

850
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,880
when you become collectively conscious.

851
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,560
All this work has been done in the ancient times.

852
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,680
As Mohammed was one of the Prophets who came,

853
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,320
out of the ten Prophets: Moses, Abraham,

854
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,600
Lao Tse …

855
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,520
then we had also people like other Prophets …

856
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,120
Socrates…

857
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:07,320
Recently, we had in India the last one,

858
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,480
is the Sai Nath — not the “Satya” one, but the Sai Nath —

859
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,240
who lived … who was representing

860
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:20,160
this great principle of Primordial Master.

861
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,880
So this is the story of your evolution.

862
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,720
The last is the most important center, is the Sahasrara,

863
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:34,320
which is open today, open from 1970, 5 May,

864
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:40,600
that we can feel the Sahasrara opening out.

865
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,160
About this center also, if you go to My center,

866
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,240
you’ll find many, many tapes

867
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,360
which will explain to you this center.

868
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,560
The only thing is that all the seats

869
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:57,320
of all the subtle centers within us

870
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,400
lie along the line like this.

871
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,080
And all the centers are within us. This is the Agnya Chakra.

872
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:07,120
And that’s how it moves: this is the Vishuddhi Chakra,

873
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,600
this is the Heart, this is the Nabhi,

874
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,320
what you call the solar plexus;

875
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,760
then we have got, in the center here, is the Mooladhara,

876
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,760
and around it is what you call the Swadhishthana.

877
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
That’s why when Swadhishthana goes out

878
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,600
or you get diabetes, you get blindness.

879
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,760
Blindness is due to the fact that your Swadhisthana is not all right.

880
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,400
Many people get blind when their eyes open —

881
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,480
can be cured by Sahaja Yoga.

882
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,600
In Geneva I cured a lady in ten minutes time.

883
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,120
It’s all due to possessions that you get here.

884
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:47,000
Coming to the Agnya Chakra, one has to say that all these chakras

885
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,360
have movement on both the sides:

886
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,400
one moves to the collective subconscious,

887
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,840
another moves to the collective supraconscious.

888
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,240
Now, if at the Agnya Chakra you start moving like that,

889
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,880
in the collective subconscious you start seeing

890
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,320
all the dead things:

891
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,560
like great deities,

892
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,320
or you can also start think … past, we can say.

893
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,600
If you move to the right, then you start seeing colors,

894
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,360
and also you start seeing lights and all those things.

895
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:19,960
With LSD also you can do it.

896
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,240
If you take LSD … many people who used to take LSD

897
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,200
and were suffering from coma just came to Me,

898
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,240
and they just never saw Me, they just saw the lights.

899
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,400
So, that is not the right thing to see Me as light

900
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,160
or as some previous deity —

901
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,720
is to see Me as I am, is the present.

902
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,280
So we have to be in the present.

903
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,520
Sahaja Yoga brings you to the present moment,

904
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,440
by which you enjoy every moment of life in its all dynamics,

905
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,120
and that’s how you become a dynamic,

906
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:55,680
loving, affectionate, relaxed personality.

907
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,600
May God bless you all!
