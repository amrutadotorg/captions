00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.542
Christmas Puja, Ganapatipule (India),
25 December 2003.

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.792
Today is a great day because we are celebrating

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:12.959
the birth of Jesus Christ.

00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:24.875
He was such a great spiritual personality,

00:00:27.083 --> 00:00:32.834
who had to suffer on the cross.

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:39.542
This is what many people don't understand,

00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:46.500
that why a man of his calibre, of his standing,

00:00:47.834 --> 00:00:49.959
of his spirituality,

00:00:50.792 --> 00:00:55.917
should have to go through so many ordeals in life.

00:01:01.208 --> 00:01:05.417
It is very easy to understand

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.083
that he was born in a circumstances

00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:13.709
which was against him,

00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:18.792
which were against divine force.

00:01:20.417 --> 00:01:30.291
So to overcome that people tried to destroy Jesus Christ.

00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:38.917
And he did not feel the pain,

00:01:39.208 --> 00:01:44.000
he didn't feel the absurdity of those people.

00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:50.208
On the contrary he went through all that ordeal

00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:55.417
with such courage and such dignity.

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:03.709
So for us, what is there to see is

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.500
that if you are divine

00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:13.291
and if you have powers of divinity,

00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:20.709
then you should have courage,

00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:25.834
and with that courage you can face all kinds of ordeals.

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:33.333
On the whole, whenever you are on this earth

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:37.834
there are problems of different types.

00:02:38.917 --> 00:02:41.917
You may belong to royal families,

00:02:42.208 --> 00:02:45.417
or may be a poor person,

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.917
there are always problems facing you.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.500
But Christ has shown by his life

00:02:59.917 --> 00:03:02.500
that though he had to suffer so much,

00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:07.208
he was so patient and courageous.

00:03:09.208 --> 00:03:13.125
His life has given us an example,

00:03:13.417 --> 00:03:18.542
what we should be, how we should behave

00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:25.417
when we are facing problems because of ignorance of people.

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:35.625
But today is a happy day because it is his birth date

00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:39.125
and we are all celebrating

00:03:39.417 --> 00:03:43.625
because he has shown us a new path of spirituality

00:03:44.542 --> 00:03:46.917
in which one has to suffer,

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.417
because of the ignorance of many who are there,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.250
he suffered so much.

00:03:56.542 --> 00:03:58.834
But today it's not so bad,

00:03:59.125 --> 00:04:05.750
people understand spirituality and divinity.

00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:09.625
And you are so many together now.

00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:21.250
In these sufferings Christ never cried or wept.

00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:29.125
He went through it in a very resolute manner.

00:04:31.125 --> 00:04:34.125
So what we have to learn from his life is

00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:36.917
that we should not be afraid.

00:04:37.542 --> 00:04:42.041
Whatever might be happening to us,

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:44.542
we should not be afraid.

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:47.125
But times have changed

00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:50.625
and people don't torture anyone

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:53.625
because of your spirituality.

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:57.959
It's not there, it's finished.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.959
Christ wiped out all that from human minds,

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.250
and people respect you for being spiritual.

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:13.959
This is the message of Christ's life,

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.834
and we all should be very happy

00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:26.750
that he has shown us this path of ignorance.

00:05:31.333 --> 00:05:35.542
The message of Sahaja Yoga is the same:

00:05:37.458 --> 00:05:41.667
that you take your realisation,

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:45.250
you take to spiritual life,

00:05:45.542 --> 00:05:48.250
and everything will work out

00:05:48.542 --> 00:05:52.166
because all the divine forces are with you.

00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:56.166
They are working out everything for you

00:05:56.458 --> 00:06:01.458
and you are so many who can say that you have witnessed it.

00:06:03.458 --> 00:06:07.458
So this kind of life that Christ had,

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.375
you don't have to go through, he has done for us.

00:06:12.667 --> 00:06:19.750
Your life will be very, very safe and peaceful and joyous.

00:06:20.458 --> 00:06:23.959
That is without my telling you,

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.542
you must have experience.

00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:31.959
These days there are also very cruel people,

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.166
very absurd and extremely aggressive,

00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:42.667
but still, no-one can harm you.

00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:45.667
Life has become very different.

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:51.750
And we thank Christ that he has gone through all that

00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:56.458
to save us from those ordeals.

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:10.166
Today is the birthday of Christ and

00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:15.375
we are all celebrating His birthday with great joy.

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:23.375
And we also know  that Jesus Christ took a lot of efforts,

00:07:23.667 --> 00:07:27.875
and we do not have such efforts as much as He has done.

00:07:28.083 --> 00:07:30.375
But how much Jesus Christ has suffered...We know this.

00:07:30.667 --> 00:07:33.166
But we do not have this kind of efforts,

00:07:33.458 --> 00:07:38.291
because the whole human community has changed.

00:07:38.583 --> 00:07:43.583
And in this changed human community,

00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:50.083
spiritual life is very, very important.

00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:57.291
From this spiritual life  many obstacles have been removed,

00:07:57.583 --> 00:08:02.166
from this we can solve our physical problems,

00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:10.166
we can solve our mental problems,

00:08:10.458 --> 00:08:15.166
we can solve household problems,

00:08:15.458 --> 00:08:17.583
we can solve the problems of the whole world.

00:08:17.875 --> 00:08:22.959
In this way the life of the whole mankind

00:08:23.291 --> 00:08:26.166
can be changed into a spiritual life.

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.583
This is very important for us to know,

00:08:30.875 --> 00:08:34.166
that on the  one hand there was Jesus Christ

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.875
who had gained a lot in spirituality,

00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:43.083
and on the other hand we have

00:08:43.375 --> 00:08:48.291
gained a small part of spirituality

00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:51.792
- and because of us the world is becoming silent.

00:08:52.083 --> 00:08:59.166
Many problems are getting solved

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.208
and mankind has understood

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.208
that it's very important to take to spiritual life.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.875
This kind of changes are because of you people,

00:09:11.208 --> 00:09:13.709
I alone cannot do anything.

00:09:13.875 --> 00:09:18.500
I am in the same situation as Jesus.

00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:24.375
To what extent can I act?

00:09:24.709 --> 00:09:28.375
Now there are many people.

00:09:28.709 --> 00:09:33.500
Now we can see

00:09:34.375 --> 00:09:42.875
how the whole world has changed.

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:47.583
Because of you, problems are getting solved,

00:09:48.583 --> 00:09:55.083
many changes have come,

00:09:55.417 --> 00:10:02.083
Many changes are coming,

00:10:02.417 --> 00:10:08.583
not only for one person,

00:10:09.917 --> 00:10:14.583
for thousands, for the whole world,

00:10:15.291 --> 00:10:17.917
in the whole community changes are coming.

00:10:18.208 --> 00:10:24.291
These things you are all doing, which is very important.

00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:35.291
Now to speak in Marathi, the life of Christ was very sad.

00:10:35.583 --> 00:10:47.291
But he did all this kind of things with love,

00:10:47.625 --> 00:10:52.625
because He was a very great soul

00:10:52.917 --> 00:11:03.291
- such a kind of person does not feel any kind of sadness.

00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:07.792
In this way we have taken to spiritual life,

00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:12.625
and now we have to give the spiritual life to everyone.

00:11:12.917 --> 00:11:17.792
People are watching our lives and  they are stunned  by seeing

00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:19.792
how happy we are.

00:11:20.417 --> 00:11:23.792
And when they understand that

00:11:24.125 --> 00:11:26.291
these things are happening in Sahaja Yoga

00:11:26.625 --> 00:11:28.709
they also enter Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.709
This is a very good thing

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.709
and also you have got this blessing.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And you have to keep this blessing very carefully.

00:11:37.333 --> 00:11:40.333
You have to work on it, and the most important

00:11:40.625 --> 00:11:46.417
thing is that you have to give this thing to everyone.

00:11:46.709 --> 00:11:51.000
You all are getting this kind of blessing

00:11:51.333 --> 00:11:55.834
- now let also other people have this kind of joy,

00:11:56.125 --> 00:12:01.208
and so all the Sahaja Yogis have to try

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.834
to give Sahaja Yoga to everyone.

00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:11.333
In the whole world Sahaja yoga has spread but it is very little.

00:12:11.625 --> 00:12:13.333
It should be spread much more.

00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:19.542
Jesus Christ had only twelve devotees,

00:12:19.834 --> 00:12:25.208
and these twelve devotees had spread Christianity

00:12:25.542 --> 00:12:30.333
- but there are many mistakes made.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:33.709
In this way you have to bear in mind that

00:12:34.041 --> 00:12:39.709
when we spread Sahaja Yoga we should not make any mistake.

00:12:40.041 --> 00:12:47.125
We should spread it in a very simple way. It is not so difficult.

00:12:47.417 --> 00:12:48.917
In this thing,

00:12:49.417 --> 00:12:56.125
Parameshwara has given you the Shakti

00:12:56.417 --> 00:13:00.125
and the brains, use it. I have full faith in you,

00:13:00.333 --> 00:13:03.125
that you can make many Sahaja Yogis

00:13:03.417 --> 00:13:06.834
and you should try to give Sahaja Yoga to everyone

00:13:07.125 --> 00:13:12.041
and only think day and night who to give Sahaja Yoga to.

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:16.542
I am blessing you for this,

00:13:16.834 --> 00:13:18.750
so this is a very big responsibility on you.

00:13:19.041 --> 00:13:21.542
Since you took to Sahaja Yoga, you had this responsibility,

00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:24.125
that from today you have to bear in mind

00:13:24.458 --> 00:13:27.750
that you have to give Sahaja Yoga to everyone

00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:29.750
and should not keep this thing just within us.

00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:33.625
May God bless you
