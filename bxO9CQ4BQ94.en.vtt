00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.160
To all the seekers of truth, I bow.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.520
We have to be the true seekers of truth,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.680
which is a rare quality people think,

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.040
but I have found out that in this world

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.000
there are many

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.840
seekers who are honestly and earnestly seeking.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.200
They are seeking the truth.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.040
They are trying to find out

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.040
what is within them,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.960
they are trying to find out what is being prophesied about them.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.520
It has been prophesied that the day of judgment will come.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.120
This is the day of judgment,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.760
when you are going to be judged.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.840
You are not going to be put into any scales

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.680
or there is no other measure by which you are going to be judged

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.120
but by knowing

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.080
how far truthful you are about your seeking

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.160
and how far you can gain something about it.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.560
Today I had a chance

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.320
to be with some media people

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.480
and yesterday also.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.480
I feel some of them just want to bring some controversy

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.000
to make it more interesting perhaps.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.840
Whatever it is -

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.560
as a Mother I have to tell you that I have to take nothing from you.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.360
I have come here to give you.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.160
If you are identified with any organization

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.920
or you think you can fight for an organization

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.040
it would be very much better that you should not disturb us,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.240
who are the people who are real seekers sitting down here.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.160
It would be very civil of you to be

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.200
away from us, because we are not identified with any organization,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.480
but with our own Self.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.200
We have no organization you know in Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.120
And every type of a person is allowed to come in Sahaja Yoga,

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.080
so that he gets the full advantage of his destiny.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.360
In My own

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.320
experiences I have found out

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.280
that people in the West are rather difficult

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.760
to get realization to begin with.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.360
In India there can be six thousand people

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.320
and just in a split of a second

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.480
their Kundalini rises and they get their realization.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.080
It’s a fact. But even when they get realization

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.800
they are not so seriously adhering to it

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.320
and they don't try to learn about the technique

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.760
of the laws of God's Love.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.320
But in the West on the contrary,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.640
though the first motion is very slow,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.200
some people get it and lose it,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.240
but they are very great seekers.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.360
They get completely transformed.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.880
I have seen people who have been drunkards, alcoholics,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.200
who have been taking drugs and who have been homosexuals,

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.280
who led a very wretched life,

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.280
did all kinds of nonsensical things to ruin themselves.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.960
Once they get realization they really become so

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.640
aware of themselves their self esteem rises

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.600
and they take to Sahaja Yoga

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.320
in a very proper auspicious way.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.120
It's something surprising

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.600
that those who can get realization very fast

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.200
are not so good for giving realization to others.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.840
They do not seem to understand

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.000
that it has to be given to other people.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.040
While those who take more time,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.480
those who have suffered so much,

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.680
those who have had a miserable life before,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.720
those people who could be condemned as

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.720
the worst people on this earth

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.120
become so beautiful, not only that

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.200
but they take it upon themselves that this great

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.800
joy of God's Love must be given to others.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.120
But of course, despite all that, we do have some

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.480
funny people in every proof sometimes who are

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.200
like dog in the manger,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.240
they don't get their realization nor do they allow others to get it.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.360
It's a - some feeling with very frivolous and flippant people,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.520
who are harmed very badly,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.800
still they don't want to have the blessings of God

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.600
and try to create problems for us.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.280
It is a sad thing that it should happen

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.280
in a country where there are so many seekers who are already lost.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.160
So many people who are God's own people are lost.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.240
One must have some civil sense in understanding

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.200
that those who are lost are the people of God.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.320
As William Blake has said

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.040
that the men of God will become prophets,

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.280
and those who will become prophets will make other prophets.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.760
This is the first thing that happens to you

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.480
that you become a prophet.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.120
In the sense that you become a saint,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.080
in the sense that the energy of God which is all pervading

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.120
which is doing all living work starts flowing through you.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.960
And when it starts flowing through you, you can use that power,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.720
not only to correct yourself and improve yourself

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.880
but give this, the blessing of peace and bliss to God.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.920
Please be seated properly,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.480
if you can't sit you sit on the chair all right?

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.480
Now,

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.720
for us it is important to understand that I am here

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.320
talking about something that is extremely holy and auspicious.

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.840
It has not worked out before.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.280
This is the first time in the history of spirituality,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.920
so many people are taking their realization.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.560
As I said, this is the time of last judgment.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.120
This is the time of resurrection which Mohammed Sahib has described

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.640
that at that time your hands will be speaking.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.480
How can hands speak?

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.720
Anybody can say that, "How can hands speak?"

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.880
But the Muslims don't think about it.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.360
They just say, “Let us do namas all the time morning till evening,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.240
do the exercise of namas and we will get realization.”

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.280
Christians think that they will get their

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.360
realization if they take their baptism.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.160
It's not so.

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.320
All these religions were established much before

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.960
just to keep you in balance.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.120
To live a life of moderation.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.160
On the contrary human beings have gone to the extremes.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.040
But I must tell you that the Divine is so generous,

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.720
is so kind, is working so fast

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.880
that despite all these things that you have done to yourself

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:36.800
and to your society,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.440
and as human beings the way you have erred

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.720
or whatever you have done, it just forgets and forgives.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.880
Because you are the children of God.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.360
Because He is your Father.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:54.120
He is the Father who is love,

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.760
who is truth, who is joy.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.440
And He is anxious that His children should enter into His kingdom

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.800
and enjoy all the blissful thing that He has to give.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.800
Now if you want to see

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.360
how you are made, you'll be surprised.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.560
We must have self esteem.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.880
We must understand that God has created us with very great care,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.000
with very great love to become human beings.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:22.720
And we should not for anything whatsoever,

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.680
whosoever it may be, the guru

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.520
or the cult or the religion or anything,

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.360
should neglect ourselves.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.040
Then you will be responsible for your own neglect

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.680
and not God Almighty or any one of these prophets;

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.920
they have said that you can be saved.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:49.800
Now as you see within us lies these subtle centers.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.640
These subtle centers are

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.400
the ones which, who represent within us

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:01.160
a different stage of evolution.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.840
First of all if you see the first center, is the Mooladhara.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.960
Now this center is very important

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.800
because - for Australians I should say -

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.560
because in the universe this center is Australia.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.520
Australia is the place

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.440
where this center we can consider as manifesting,

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.040
the powers of Mooladhara chakra.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.560
It is the most powerful center in the whole being.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.920
Because it is the power

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.760
of innocence in a human being.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.480
The innocence that is the matter, matter is innocent,

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.440
animals are innocent,

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.800
because they haven’t developed their ego so far,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.320
neither they have got those conditionings

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:54.280
by which we are supposed to be sinners.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.560
A dog or a horse or a camel,

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.000
none of them think that they are sinners.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.560
It's only we think that we are sinners

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.840
and we have done something wrong.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.360
The reason for this is that God has given us freedom.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.480
So whatever we have done in that freedom

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.440
we feel responsible for it

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.400
and we start condemning ourselves as sinners and all those things.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:26.000
But who feels that he is a sinner is the ego and not the Spirit.

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.520
The Spirit does not commit any sin!

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.560
Is the purest of pure,

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.440
nothing can contaminate it,

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.160
nothing can destroy it,

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:40.000
nothing can make it absolutely invisible.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.920
It is all the time there within our heart,

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.680
watching what we are doing.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.760
As described in Gita is called as Kshetrajna,

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.040
the one who knows the field, who watches the field,

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:54.520
who is the witness of the field, which resides in our heart.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.160
All these things whatever I've said has to happen to us,

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.040
otherwise it just becomes our mental activity.

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.320
I have nothing to bring in anything that is controversial,

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.760
everybody has brought out some sort of a thing

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.160
and said that this is this and this is this.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.280
But one must know that once you get

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.640
your Self-realization it must work.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.880
That's the point people do not understand,

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.920
that if you go to a guru,

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.800
did it work out your own powers?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.880
Maybe they might be paying you for doing some work,

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.160
doesn't matter, that's another enterprise.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.480
But did it give you the reality?

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.320
Did it give your absolute meaning?

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.640
It has given you your purpose or not?

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.320
Has it finished your seeking or not?

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.520
You must ask these questions to yourself and be truthful about it.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.080
If not then you better get it.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.840
Now to say that I am the only person doing this,

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.360
is all comes out of these people asking funny questions to you.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.680
Now the thing is, she asked me a question:

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.480
“Are you the only person doing it?”

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.200
I said, I don't know of any other.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:02.000
I mean you can twist it the way you like,

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.560
but so far I haven't met anyone who is giving mass-realization.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.720
I have not met anyone and if I meet I will be very happy to retire.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.840
Even if the sahaja yogis

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.320
who come up to that level can give mass-realization just like that

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.200
it would be a nice idea to retire

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.280
because now I am going to be 60 years of age

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.960
and I think I deserve retirement after the hard work of 14 years.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.400
This one is the first center as I told you,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.520
is this great country of

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.040
Ganesha - Australia.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.200
The symbol of this is already expressed

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:45.160
in the place called as Ayers Rock.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.160
Ayers Rock if you go and see

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.560
has the symbol which is embodying

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.920
the great deity that resides on this.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.720
That has the same colour if you see there

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.320
and it has the same deity sitting down there

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.440
which is called as Shri Ganesha in the Sanskrit language.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.280
Now this deity, innocent deity

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.400
or the one which is representing innocence,

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.720
incarnated on this earth

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.440
for our sake, for our salvation

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.920
as our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:26.000
He incarnated and He is bestowed upon

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.280
that center of Agnya which you see there

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:32.320
which is actually the body is made of the sun.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.960
That's why most of the Christians are sun worshippers.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.480
This great personality came on this earth

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.800
with a very great work because all others

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.120
also you can see, but today I would like to speak about Him.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:51.720
I was told in Adelaide there are lots of churches.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:54.640
But every human being is a church of God

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.480
and temple of God, in that resides Christ,

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:02.120
at this point which is the gate you can see very clearly,

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.160
in that gate He resides

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:07.760
and that is the cross which He has carried,

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.640
on which He was crucified,

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.320
because this cross was too tight,

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.640
and something had to pass through it.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.920
His resurrection is the message to all the Christians

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.880
that the way He resurrected

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.560
you are going to be resurrected by God Almighty.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.280
He came on this earth,

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.160
suffered for you and He died on the cross,

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:34.560
just to give you this special privilege of having this great

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.880
Agnya Chakra there which He adores.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.120
This is the Agnya Chakra within us.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.760
Now the mistake lies in one thing

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.960
that when we say of baptism, it is not an artificial process.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.720
This is a living process.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.120
Christ could not have talked of something artificial or ritualistic.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.480
What He said, baptism was that the Kundalini should be awakened

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.440
and it should penetrate through this fontanel bone area,

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:09.320
and should give you the experience of the Holy Ghost.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.120
Now this what I am saying

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.920
is also written in an Indian book about our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:21.160
and we do not read the right books in Sanskrit

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.880
because they are not translated.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.440
What we are reading are the so called pseudo people

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.040
who came about from 50 years back and try to preach

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.400
about Hinduism or some sort of a "ism".

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.200
But about Christ nobody told.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.320
When they came from other countries to visit India,

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.640
nobody told that He is the Maha Vishnu

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.840
because nobody knew about it. They could not relate it.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.800
They could not relate, they could not tell

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.080
that He was the incarnation of the Maha Vishnu.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:58.120
And Maha Vishnu is the one, if you read in the Devi Mahatmayam

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:03.320
everything tallies exactly with a character of Shri Jesus Christ.

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:07.880
If you read it you will be amazed how clearly He is described.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.080
Even it is described that first He was an egg

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:17.960
and out of the egg, half egg was Shri Ganesha

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.200
and the half egg became Shri Jesus Christ.

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.480
And then, that's why on a Easter day if you know,

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.840
we always give eggs, meaning

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.160
we human beings are eggs at this time

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.600
as human beings, but we have to become the bird.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:42.840
He came on this earth specially for creating a very special

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.640
type of device and an awareness within us.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.120
Because this is the gate as I told you

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.600
to the Kingdom of God which is the limbic area within us.

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.720
Whatever is in the subtle is in the gross.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.760
So this limbic area was

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:05.600
to be achieved through piercing through one gate that is

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.520
our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.440
Now how to pierce it was a problem because

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.120
if anybody tried to pierce it, he may just

00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:20.040
go on the sides and become something else but a superconcious man.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:25.840
So it was Jesus Christ who is the embodiment of

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:30.040
the Ruh, the All Pervading Power, the Chaitanya, the Omkara,

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:34.000
He came on this earth and He did that job for us,

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.960
because He resides there.

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.360
Now what He said by

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.960
the second birth or by baptism was

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:47.200
that this Kundalini which is lying

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.600
at the triangular bone there, has to rise.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.040
Rise and penetrate through this center,

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.000
awaken Jesus Christ there.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.600
Now the - what great miraculous thing

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.560
He has done that once you awaken this center within us,

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.200
these two institutions on the left and the right,

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.480
one is the ego, another is the super ego;

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.040
one is the ego which gives us

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:19.720
all ideas about ourselves which are not really self esteem

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.520
but something false.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.680
And super ego is the

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.800
condition in which we human beings become conditioned,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.120
in which we accept conditions: I am this, I am this, I am this.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.760
Both the things are sucked in by the awakening

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.360
of the Kundalini of this great incarnation on this earth.

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.960
Once it is sucked in what you find that

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.560
on top of your head where you reach

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.040
this place, you find that it has become an open space now.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.960
And suddenly you find the Kundalini is rising

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.960
and you can feel the breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:01.800
In the bible about Holy Ghost very little is written,

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.800
for that you have go to Indian Scriptures were She is described

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.600
as the power of God Almighty, as Adi Shakti.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.600
It is not proper to bind yourself like a horse

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:19.320
and see whatever is available but open yourself out

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:23.320
and see the references that are given about the great happening

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.520
of the advent of Shri Jesus Christ.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.720
Now what relations He has with Shri Krishna, with Shri Rama

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.720
with other deities and other prophets

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.840
is to be seen later on. When you come to Sahaja Yoga

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.080
gradually you realize that they are all related to each other.

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.880
And Christ has openly

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:47.600
said that those who are not against are with Me.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.840
The three people who went to

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:53.560
see Jesus when He was born were Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.640
Is described, were the three great people

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:00.080
who went to see Jesus He was born was

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:06.080
Shri Krishna as Vishnu

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.920
and Mahesha is Shiva,

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.320
and Brahma as Brahmadeva.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.920
All these people went to worship.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.920
Nobody knew from where they came,

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.120
who they were, they were called as the three wise men.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.360
Now whatever I am saying has to be first experienced,

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:26.360
because if I say something need not be true;

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.160
as I would say that it is not essential

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.520
that you should believeevery word I say.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.880
On the contrary blind faith is against Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.760
It should happen to you first,

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.000
once it happens then you will be amazed

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.720
that you yourself is a very great

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.080
miraculous instrument of God.

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:51.760
You will be amazed, how this instrument works.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.560
Even the people who come to Me, say,

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:56.320
“Mother we are gone cases we are good for nothing,

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.200
we led a very bad life we are inauspicious.”

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.960
Every sort of thing, I said, "Now

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.640
let it be, you don't judge yourself.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:06.920
Let the Divine judge you, let's see what happens to you.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.760
Why are you after yourself?

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.120
Forget it, first of all you did mistakes,

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:15.240
doesn't matter, but now you are using that again to harm yourself.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.160
So please forget all the mistakes, everything that has been done,

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.760
all wrong things you think you have done.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.040
Only you get what you have."

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:28.240
I am here just to give that what you have.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:33.040
Now this great happening takes place

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.320
in such a smooth way in people who are normal people.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.720
But not in all people I would say.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:44.200
Some people do not feel it because they have some abnormalities

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:47.280
in their different centers which are placed within you.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:51.960
These are the subtle centers expressed outside as gross centers.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.720
They are all the time there,

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.120
but the deities within them are not yet enlightened.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.400
They only get enlightened when the Kundalini rises

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.880
and pierces through the fontanel bone area.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.040
Now the Spirit resides in the heart.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:11.960
The Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty,

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.920
and Holy Ghost is the Power of God,

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:19.480
the Shakti of God which manifest everything else.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.640
You'll be amazed how in the gross these things can be seen,

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.160
absolutely into the grossest thing.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.240
My son in law is a great photographer

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.480
and he was working on Himalaya, ultimately I said you take it

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:36.120
from some old books and find out about it.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:40.360
So I gave him an idea that you go and see near Manasarovar.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.200
There is a place called Manasarovar

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.320
where also you find the Sadashiva is kept,

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.720
just like a human face.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.280
Twelve miles of area you can see that it's just a human being,

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.400
a face of a human being which is called as Dakshinamurthy,

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.320
which is looking towards the south.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.920
And this one is just a - not melted at all,

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.480
nothing, is all the time there

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.480
and if you see the face there are two other

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.840
aspects of Him are shown on His head.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.760
But I told him that in Manasarovar

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.520
if you go that is the super ego, Manasa.

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:25.240
Manasa means the emotional mind, you see,

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.680
English language is rather funny

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.040
but I tell you Manasa means the emotional mind.

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.560
There is this emotional mind represented as Manasarovar.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.480
And after that I told him there must be another one.

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.640
He said yes there is another one which is called as Rakshastal.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.600
Rakshasa you know, the word Rakshasa means a devil - Rakshastal.

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.200
And now that Rakshastal is so turbulent

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.280
despite the fact they are close to each other

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.880
and between them is placed this Sadhashiva's image,

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.280
but this Rakshastal is so turbulent

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.440
that one can't believe that the same,

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.680
at the same place these two are having a different type of nature.

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.960
And those people who went with him could not even touch that

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.040
water of that Rakshastal, because it represented the ego,

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.400
less they become ego oriented, so they would not touch it.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.440
So this was nothing, you see there are so many things in the gross

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.720
you can make it out whatever is described in the old times

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.720
is there existing, it is there.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.960
In the same way human beings are in the intermediate state

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.760
and if you go even subtler

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.120
you'll find all these centers are within you.

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:37.240
Now how can you prove through Kundalini

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.960
that what I am saying is true?

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.360
That we have to see for oneself because in the West

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.120
I have to go on convincing people, convincing people,

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.880
pleading them for their realization.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.200
Just for getting realization I have to put all, put forward

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.960
all kinds of explanations, all kinds of suggestions

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.960
that they should believe that they can get Self-realization.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.800
There are people also who say, “How can you get it so easily?”

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.440
But if I say you can, why not try it, what's the harm?

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.360
It is so difficult to convince a

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.640
mind which is all the time thinking about it,

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.360
you can't think about it.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:15.080
You can't think about a sprouting of the seed, it just works out,

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.840
if you put a seed in the mother earth it just works out.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.680
You don't have to think,

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.720
if you start thinking about it, will it sprout? It will not.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.120
It is the capacity of the mother earth that does the job.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.120
But that time we take it for granted.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.720
In the same way if I say you can get your Self-realization,

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:37.400
people start being doubtful about it.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.440
Another thing is, that it is the other way round,

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.520
it is you who has to take something

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.280
not that I have to take anything from you.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.960
You cannot give Me anything, it's you who has to benefit by it,

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.960
not Me. So why there should be a question

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:53.760
when I am not selling anything,

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.520
when I am not acquiring anything out of you,

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.360
when there is no possibility of you being exploited

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.800
or plundered by Me or used by Me.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.680
Why should you get this doubt in your mind?

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.480
Is it also that you feel doubtful about yourself?

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.160
But that is to be decided by the Divine and not by you.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.880
So please first of all try to know that you are the Spirit

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.920
and that you have to become the Spirit

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:24.040
and that once you become the Spirit

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.760
you become collectively conscious.

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.880
Today only when I went for this interview for the ABC,

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.880
the gentleman was -

00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:38.680
of course interviewed Me, when I came out there was a lady.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.720
And I told the lady that you have got liver trouble.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.680
She asked Me, "How do you know, did he tell you?"

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:48.320
I said, "Nobody told Me, but I know because I know."

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.080
So that's what happens to you, that you become

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:54.240
collectively conscious, you can feel it on your hands

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.360
what's wrong with others and with yourself.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.120
Now when we come to this

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.480
point of realization, we have to know

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.160
that the problems of this world are due to one fact,

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.880
that we have not achieved our absolute.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:14.480
Some people think by doing alternate work we’ll be happier.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:17.680
If supposing somebody is a capitalist he’ll become a communist.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.880
Then if he is the communist, he’ll become a socialist.

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.120
These are all manufactures of this brain.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.640
But actually if you ask, I'm a

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:29.440
complete capitalist because I have all the powers

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.440
and I am a complete communist

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.720
because I can’t live without giving it to you.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:39.400
So how the communism and capitalism, which is so artificial outside,

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.880
becomes a reality with you, that you become empowered

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.400
with your real powers and not unreal powers

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.920
because possessions and things are unreal.

00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.720
They are not real powers,

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:56.160
and once you get these real powers you want to share it with others.

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.880
You want to give it to others, you want to work it out for others.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.280
And under these modern circumstances where we think

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.600
we are very frustrated and we are unhappy,

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.240
that's why we are going to God, is a wrong statement.

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.920
You are coming to God because you have been seekers

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.800
of ages.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.120
You have been seeking long time back

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:22.360
and this is the time, the fruit of it is coming.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:27.200
I've met so many children, even in Australia, who are born realized.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.840
Great saints are taking their birth today

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.680
just to do this God's work

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:36.160
and you will find that you are one of them who has been seeking.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:38.120
In Nala Damayanthi Puran, which was written

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.560
I think sixteen thousand years back,

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.120
it is mentioned that this Nala got very angry with Kali -

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.320
Kali is the one who governs this modern times -

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.040
and He said, "I am going to kill you,

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.560
because you create confusion in the minds of people,

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.760
you create complete confusion of values,

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.120
and you make them destroy themselves.

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:59.160
So I better destroy you once for all,

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.200
so there is no problem for human beings."

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.400
So Kali said, "All right you can destroy Me

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.120
but I have some good points,

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.880
you must know also the importance of My being there."

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.600
He said, "What is your importance?" He said, "The importance is

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.000
that when I will come on this earth to rule

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.720
that time, these people who are now

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.880
wondering in the Himalayas, wondering in the hills

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.040
and dales all over the world who are seeking

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.640
outside the cities, outside the houses

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.960
will find the answer.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.600
They will find the God Almighty.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:36.440
They will find their Spirit!”

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.760
He said it about sixteen thousand years back

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.000
and that is today has started.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:46.480
The point where we have to

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:49.560
be really sure is, that this is the time.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.320
Because the signs and symptoms are like that.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.920
You can’t imagine so many people seeking

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.720
anywhere in the world,

00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:01.240
anytime. When even Christ came

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.680
it was so difficult to carry those twelve people with Him.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.520
Nobody was seeking at the time.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:08.920
He of course gave sermons, He talked about it

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.640
that is the last, we can say,

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.920
who was such a great Incarnation on this earth,

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.600
but nobody listened to Him.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.840
After that Mohammed came. When He lived how people treated Him!

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:20.600
They tried to poison Him, they tried to torture Him

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.760
and He had such a miserable life

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.760
that the Muslims today when they behave in the same manner,

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.120
it is most surprising that whatever He has suffered

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:34.520
the people have to support, suffer at the hands of these Muslims.

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.360
There are other also ideas people have got

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:41.040
like we must suffer for our emancipation;

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.600
or we must cleanse ourselves.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.120
Already somebody has suffered for us.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.760
There is no need for you to suffer and do all these things.

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:54.400
As I said that Jews believed in it and they denied Christ.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:58.240
Then they suffered, really they suffered,

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.160
but after that suffering was there any transformation?

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.440
On the contrary they were so embittered

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.080
the way they behave while killing these PLO-people,

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:10.520
you will be amazed, the same people who suffered so badly

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.920
forgot all that and became such cruel people

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.720
and they killed so many people.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.360
So this kind of a suffering doesn't bring

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.920
any kind of transformation within you.

00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:23.720
Transformation has to take place,

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.240
this is the condition of your Self.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.120
If the Self is manifesting,

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:31.840
it is not that you believe in this and I believe in that,

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.320
It IS! It's no question of believing, IT IS so!

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.680
That is what it is, nothing to be believed into blindly

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:42.600
or to be professed into or to accept something,

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.840
but it is there within you and that is an absolute truth.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.520
Even if there are ten small children sitting

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.760
and they are realized souls

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.000
and if you ask them, "What is the condition of this gentleman?"

00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.000
They will all raise one finger. This means only one thing,

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.960
because they can feel it, on their finger something burning,

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.240
maybe something numb, maybe something heavy.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:09.160
All of them, even if you tie their eyes, will say the same thing

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.160
because truth is the same.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.880
As all of us are sitting here we know it's night

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.240
and that the colour of this thing is greenish or whatever it is.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.120
In the same way, when you get your realization, the feeling,

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.360
the awareness comes in your feeling and this feeling

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:33.520
tells you exactly where you are and what you have to do.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:38.400
It is a remarkable thing that you are a human being.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.400
Is the greatest work of God,

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.400
the greatest creation of God is human being.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.280
Of course you may think they are ugly

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.080
and you should have nothing to do with them.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.800
There are some people who just believe that

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.160
human beings are the ugliest thing. But they are not!

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:56.240
Only thing, they have not been put to the mains,

00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.200
this is yoga, is the union with the Divine.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:04.160
Unless and until an instrument is put to the mains,

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:09.920
to its source, it has no meaning.

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.920
In the same way unless and until

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:15.080
you are put to the mains, you will have no meanings.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.240
So the best thing is for you to be convinced

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.240
that you have to have your realization

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:24.200
and it can work out in a split of a second and let it work out.

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:29.280
Just work it out is the best for you that anyone can

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:32.480
suggest that you become the Self.

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.840
Now about the Self I have talked many a times, I told people

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:41.760
that Self is the one that is residing in your heart.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.600
But the seat of the Self is here, the Sadhashiva.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:50.440
He stands here and when the Kundalini rises and touches that,

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.760
the seat sends message to the Heart

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:59.560
and then the Heart starts feeling throwing those vibrations.

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:02.480
Actually it is not the Spirit that does

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:08.640
but it is the Kundalini after enlightenment starts pulsating.

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.960
It’s so clear-cut, you can’t imagine,

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:14.520
it is so beautiful, you can’t imagine.

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:18.240
Now the result of this Self-realization -

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.600
in this short time I have to cover many points

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.600
and that's why I am trying to cover it up -

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.360
is first of all you get your physical

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.640
fitness. People ask Me, "How could You cure physically?"

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:31.720
If you are doctors here, you will understand

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.600
that doctors do not know anything about

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.520
parasympathetic nervous system.

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:38.560
That is the expression of the central path

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.920
within us called as the Sushumna Nadi.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.600
This parasympathetic nervous system gives us the balance,

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:48.320
the sustenance.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:52.280
For example, if you are running fast your heartbeat increases.

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.040
But it is slowed down

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.960
by the action of parasympathetic nervous system.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.680
When the Kundalini is awakened this parasympathetic nervous system

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:06.160
becomes evident in our awareness.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:11.440
First time the Spirit starts becoming

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.400
one with our attention.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.960
Our attention itself becomes enlightened.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.760
Now when this Kundalini rises,

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.000
this parasympathetic nervous system starts manifesting itself

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.280
and whatever center is exhausted

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.880
by which an imbalance is created within us

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:30.600
in our physical body or in our emotional body

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.960
or in our mental body or in our spiritual body,

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:39.080
it starts absolutely

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:45.280
behaving in a manner as if we have reached our total blessings.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:49.160
It just disappears, it just disappears.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:53.040
And it is so surprising, that people don't want to believe it

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.680
because they have seen a person behaving this manner and that manner

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.920
and suddenly next day overnight they find

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:03.160
the person who is an alcoholic becomes a free bird.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:06.360
They find a drug addict becoming a free bird,

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:08.800
they can’t believe it. It is fantastic!

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.360
Everything that God does is fantastic.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.600
All His work we have taken for granted,

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.080
at least this living work of God

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.520
you can understand that it works within you.

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.240
It is beyond all your dogmas,

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:24.440
all your philosophies, all your complications.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:26.360
Because it is unlimited,

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.680
while your brain is limited, your intelligence is limited.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.240
And if you want to understand God

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.960
you cannot understand It

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.520
by this limited thing, which is your brain.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:40.280
Of course logically you can come to conclusion.

00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:45.520
You have to come to conclusion logically understanding that

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.720
you cannot pay for it, you cannot work it out,

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.520
it has to be spontaneous

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:54.800
and you cannot do it yourself.

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.160
Everything you can do it yourself,

00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:59.320
but realization has to be worked out

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.600
by somebody who is an enlightened person.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.200
For example if I work it out for any one of you,

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.520
that person can work it out for others.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:10.160
This is so simple as that and I think

00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:12.760
it is high time that we should go in for realization,

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:15.720
we have so many people and I won't be able to attend to you,

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.640
if I continue with the speech.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.120
Is it all right for you to have the realization now?

00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:26.200
Just open any window here, either air condition or anything.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.800
If you do not treat yourself with respect,

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.920
nobody can treat you with respect.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:35.120
So be respectful about it and try to

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.800
get the blessings of realization,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.280
that would be a nice idea.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.960
By the way we have now been able to

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.920
get some people to work in Adelaide

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:54.240
for you to go further with your realization

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.960
and understanding what it is,

00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.240
to learn the technique of it.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.160
And once you learn the technique

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:07.040
you will find it will help you a lot to help others.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:12.920
And if you are intelligent enough you can do it very well.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:15.840
Will you please all put your hands towards Me

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.120
like this, just like that.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.960
Those who don't want to do it

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.880
should please go away and leave us alone,

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.920
I would request you those who don't want to do

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.640
meditation should go away

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.680
and don't disturb others because it spoils the vibrations of people,

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:33.840
so those who don't want to do it please go away.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.960
You don't want to do it?
Can I ask a question?

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.920
No, no, no question today, I have had enough

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.880
of questions this morning, will you please go.

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:42.720
No you can write, all right.

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.920
You can write to Me, you see the questions I had too many

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.640
and I want to attend to everyone.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:50.080
You remember last time how much I had to work

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:51.840
and I couldn't attend to everyone.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.080
So it's better not to attend to anybody's personal questions,

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.320
it's not proper because I want to give attention to you all.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.560
You see, if you have any questions you may write to Me

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.720
and I'll let you know. Please put your hands towards Me.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.120
All of you should do it. Those who do not want to do it, again I say

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.360
please be civil and kind

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:14.040
and go away as proper people, and don't try to disturb us.

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:17.760
Please put your hands towards Us.

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.600
You may write your questions

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.640
and come and see Me tomorrow morning, all right?

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.280
If you have any questions, I'll give you special time.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.160
You have also questions? All right,

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.400
so can you go out now and write down.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.880
Why not? You cannot force yourself to be here,

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.880
it is very wrong. You want to force.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.960
Why?

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:39.520
No that's not I am not going to waste any time with you, but

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.280
is very unkind of you to force us like that.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:44.960
We never come to your meetings, why should you come to our meeting

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.440
and disturb us? It's not proper.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:51.160
It's all right, forget it now!

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:53.200
We have, I have nothing to talk, no no it's all right,

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.280
don't disturb us, please, please will you behave yourself, or ask him to get out.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.920
"Why do you call yourself God?”

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.080
All right, forget it just now,

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.760
you are God is it? What good have you done to anyone

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.520
that you are here to object Me?

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:09.160
Have you done any good to anyone so far? Not even to yourself.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.160
Then, why don’t you allow Me to do good to others?

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.040
All right. Now don't talk!

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.280
Keep your hands like this.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:19.800
I could see the way he is,

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.960
I could see that, immediately I pointed out,

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.120
you see among all. All right keep yourself shut!

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.280
You only know how to talk, you have a big mouth,

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.440
that’s all, nothing more.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:34.720
Please close your eyes.

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:38.680
Please close your eyes.

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.440
With both hands towards Me,

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:14.640
you just close your eyes and don't worry about others,

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.920
just think of yourself just now

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.280
that you have to have this experience.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:22.160
So many people had experience in the last meeting

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:26.120
and you all should have it.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:23.240
Even if you are thinking it does not matter.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:27.720
Let loose your attention, don't put any pressure on your attention.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.000
Just let loose your attention.

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.160
Now as I told you the left hand

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.160
is the power of your desire.

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:25.040
And the right side is the power of your action.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.520
So with your left hand on your lap in a very relaxed manner

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:35.320
you raise your right hand to your heart, to your heart

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:48.240
and ask a question within yourself, not loudly,

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:52.840
'Mother am I the Spirit?'

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.920
Just put your hand right on your heart.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:11.040
Left hand towards Me, left hand towards Me, just ask a question,

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:16.600
'Mother am I the Spirit?'

00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:25.800
Now put this right hand on your stomach on the left hand side

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.120
which is the center of your

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:33.240
guru, the primordial master.

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:36.720
As you are the master of yourself,

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:42.000
you just say, 'Mother, I am the master.'

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.680
'Am I the master?' we asked the other day,

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.840
today you say, 'Mother, I am my own guru , I am my own master.’

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.880
With full confidence you should say.

00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.760
You should understand it fully within yourself

00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:00.200
that unless and until you become a master,

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:04.960
you cannot make out who is true, who is not true.

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:11.840
You cannot make it out! So first of all you become the master.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:15.480
Put your right hand

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:22.920
on your stomach on the left hand side and ask a question,

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.320
if you have come today for the first time.

00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.560
But those who've got realization

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:33.880
the other day must say, ’Mother, I am the master.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.560
I am the guru.'

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:46.160
You don't need any guru because your Spirit is the guru.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:51.280
Your Spirit is the guru! Just awaken your Spirit.

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:07.760
Now again raise your hand higher on the heart

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.680
and say,

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:18.840
'Mother, I am the Spirit.’  Just say that.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.320
Now put this right hand

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.800
on the left side of your neck

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.120
which is another center of Vishuddhi.

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:05.200
You are yourself raising your own Kundalini.

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:10.480
At this center you have to say, 'Mother, I am not guilty.'

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.360
Say it again, not to feel guilty for anything

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:17.480
that you think you have done wrong.

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:20.800
Just say, 'Mother, I 'm not guilty.'

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:39.880
Because the instrument that you are

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.080
has to be cured by the Divine.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:50.200
Because you have to do God's work. This is God's work!

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.680
Unless and until you feel

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:59.640
completely relieved of your guilt,

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:04.760
how can you work out God's things?

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:22.480
If you have said mantras or something in unauthorised way,

00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:26.080
also you develop this trouble on the left side

00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:28.880
which is a very dangerous thing to develop

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:32.320
and thus you develop a heart trouble

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:35.920
and can be at a very early age,

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:38.760
you might suffer from a heart trouble.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:45.000
So better say, 'Mother, I'm not guilty.’ If you are the Spirit

00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.640
then how can you be guilty?

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:51.720
There is another danger that lies while saying all these mantras

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:55.720
that one can develop diseases like cancer,

00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:01.600
osteomalayetie and all these by saying wrong mantras,

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:05.800
guided by some wrong gurus.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.160
So if you have done anything like that

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:12.720
you have to say, 'Mother, I'm not guilty.’

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:21.880
It can have very serious effects, very serious effects,

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:30.880
specially the muscular part can be absolutely

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:34.800
paralysed on the left side.

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:47.480
Now put your right hand across the forehead

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:54.560
and say,

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.160
'Mother, I forgive everyone.’

00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:01.440
This you have to say with full heart and full understanding

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:03.320
because the other day, you remember

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.920
that when you said it, immediately you got your realization.

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:11.880
Before that it was all blocked up in the blockage.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.800
You have to forgive, forgive others,

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.240
forgive others! If you have self esteem

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:21.360
then you will respect others also, otherwise you cannot have respect.

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:24.520
If you do not respect yourself, you cannot respect others.

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:28.800
The first thing is you must say, 'I forgive everyone.’

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.880
Not to get upset by what has happened

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:38.280
or what somebody does to you, but just to say, 'I forgive everyone.’

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:44.280
Some people say it is difficult to forgive

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:46.800
but I think it is a myth.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.040
Because when you forgive what do you do? You just

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.320
are forgiving yourself

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.920
because you are not anymore suffering

00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:00.960
from the embitterment from others.

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:05.840
Now put the same hand on top of your head.

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.960
First on top of your Sahasrara.

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:22.320
Now you have to see, it has to work, it has to work out,

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.040
it's not just talking, but it has to work out.

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:27.680
Now see for yourself,

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.160
raise your hand a little higher.

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:33.760
At this stage you have to ask for realization,

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.120
because I cannot cross your freedom.

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:41.600
So say, 'Mother, please give us realization" at this point.

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.560
just put your hand

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:49.440
parallel to your fontanel bone area.

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.880
Now put the other hand and see

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.600
if there is a cool breeze coming out.

00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:59.400
Put your right hand towards Me,

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.480
just put your right hand towards Me,

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:06.960
whether you are sick or anything, you just work it out.

00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.960
It's there, yes.

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:17.280
You have to convince yourself.

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:21.320
Nobody can convince you, it is you who has to convince yourself.

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.040
You have to feel it yourself.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:27.360
If you are not feeling it, then there is something wrong with you.

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:30.600
Doesn't matter, we'll work it, it should, it should work out.

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.520
If you are not feeling it then is not correct.

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:37.360
Now you can also change again the hand and say that -

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:39.440
find for yourself,

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.640
and ask a question, 'Is this the

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:45.200
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?' Ask a question.

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:49.320
Now rapport is established, just see for yourself.

00:52:57.040 --> 00:53:00.560
See now how you are feeling cooler with the same

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:05.600
thing, is because you have become yourself an air conditioner.

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.480
That's why you all are feeling cooler

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.000
otherwise you all are feeling so hot.

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:14.680
Where is that heat gone now? Just see the proof.

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:19.600
If there is too much heat that means you are either

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:25.560
a liver patient or some disease there which is to be attended.

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:32.640
See for yourself.

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.680
If you, even if you are paid by some guru,

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:41.480
better get your realization

00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.600
because they can give you only money,

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.040
which you can't take with you. Better take your realization,

00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:49.520
to be wise and sensible, be good children.

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:54.960
Take your realization! This is the chance of lives!

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:08.760
Now put your both the hands like that

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:12.680
and ask a question in your heart,'Is this the

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:17.760
breeze of the Holy Ghost we are feeling?'

00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:24.920
You will start feeling the cool breeze in your hands,

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:29.560
the sensation crawling down your hands.

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:34.040
All right? Now put your hands towards Me.

00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:37.400
I'll also teach you how to give realization.

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:41.640
I'll try to teach you how to give yourself a realization

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:45.920
which is a very simple method of maintaining your realization.

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:47.840
Apart from that

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:50.440
there are going to be some sahaja yogis here

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:55.040
who are going to help you to progress further.

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.680
This hand is to be placed in front of your

00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:05.040
Kundalini like this, this is the

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.280
fixed hand, you can say the fixed movement,

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:11.320
and this right hand is to be taken round like this.

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:15.520
higher in front and down. Everything should be intelligible,

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:18.720
you should understand why we do it. You see clockwise method

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.520
is better to raise the Kundalini. Now do it,

00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.280
it's not just to tell some

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:25.440
mantras to someone and you jump like a frog,

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:29.800
it's really, it should happen in a way that is happening.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.560
Now put your hands like that. Now take it down.

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:37.960
Again we have to give a knot up there,

00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:42.520
it's the raising of the Kundalini. Let's do again.

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:46.760
The truth is so abounding, that you deny it is dishonesty,

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.880
is dishonesty, complete dishonesty!

00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:54.320
Now take it up, one more. Now weave it up.

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:06.040
Do it one more, now thrice you have to do it, one,

00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:08.400
two,

00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:13.640
three. Now see for yourself.

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.960
All right?

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:22.720
You feel very peaceful.

00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:26.760
The other day I had a lady who came quite stunned,

00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:30.480
she could not believe that she is so much changed

00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:34.320
and she said, “I have become a free person now.”

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:37.480
All right? Good.

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:41.600
So thank you very much and if you have any other problem

00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:43.720
of some disease or anything

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:45.440
you can come and see Me now.
