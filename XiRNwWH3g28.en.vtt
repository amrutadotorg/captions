WEBVTT

00:01.774 --> 00:06.855
What enthusiasm all over the world!

00:09.424 --> 00:15.277
The whole of Sydney, I think, has been
drenched of all their flowers.

00:16.102 --> 00:20.129
And such nice things to say,

00:20.330 --> 00:25.507
the cards and the letters and the beautiful
poems,

00:25.708 --> 00:32.272
the children are singing beautifully.

00:37.759 --> 00:45.061
Words fail to express the feelings
of such jubilation

00:45.262 --> 00:49.760
and such sincere feeling of happiness.

00:58.960 --> 01:02.506
You needed a Mother

01:03.840 --> 01:10.536
to look after you, to care for you

01:10.935 --> 01:19.734
and to be able to transform you

01:21.614 --> 01:24.528
with lot of wisdom.

01:29.847 --> 01:35.079
So every birthday I find

01:37.750 --> 01:47.170
that Sahaja Yogis are also expanding
their hearts

01:47.720 --> 01:56.832
and realizing that they are no more drops
but they are part and parcel of the ocean.

01:57.782 --> 02:07.557
And that the ocean itself is going
to strengthen them and look after them.

02:07.914 --> 02:15.630
It’s the ocean that is going to nourish
them.

02:18.214 --> 02:25.124
And the same ocean is going to guide them.

02:26.022 --> 02:29.909
So the connection between a drop
and an ocean

02:30.110 --> 02:36.325
has to be fully established.
So the limitations of a drop

02:36.526 --> 02:44.039
have to be absolutely dissolved
into the greatness of the ocean.

02:49.320 --> 02:58.517
With care and with nice things to say

02:58.805 --> 03:04.189
we can improve the depth
of the collectivity,

03:04.719 --> 03:09.820
and with sincere desire to be collective.

03:10.392 --> 03:16.533
The desire to be collective has to be
very sincere.

03:16.734 --> 03:25.830
So, this expanse of your being will start.

03:26.031 --> 03:31.058
The first thing is needed: a sincerity
to yourself.

03:31.431 --> 03:37.031
Of course, because we are coming
from a drop status,

03:37.232 --> 03:44.318
from a drop, a little limited drop,
from that phase,

03:44.519 --> 03:50.969
so we get engulfed again and again
into those limitations.

03:51.950 --> 04:00.720
But we must see our own vision:
what you will be in future,

04:00.921 --> 04:04.878
what you want to be in future.

04:06.583 --> 04:11.290
Thus the sincerity itself to the idea
that you want to be collective,

04:11.491 --> 04:17.836
itself, will break all barriers.

04:18.974 --> 04:24.931
If you are sincere to any purpose,
anything, then you forget the time,

04:25.132 --> 04:28.893
you forget the labor, you forget
everything, you want to achieve it,

04:29.094 --> 04:32.257
even in small things.

04:33.287 --> 04:37.645
Now, this sincerity comes from where?

04:38.695 --> 04:42.361
There are two things which work out
sincerity.

04:42.562 --> 04:50.443
Firstly, you must see for yourself what
is Sahaja Yoga,

04:51.366 --> 04:54.257
what it has given you.

04:56.054 --> 04:59.847
It has given you Realization,

05:00.279 --> 05:06.360
it has given you that wider vision, it has
given you collective consciousness,

05:06.560 --> 05:11.468
it has given you thoughtless awareness
and doubtless awareness.

05:11.669 --> 05:20.173
It has made a new personality out of you,
like an egg becoming a bird.

05:21.173 --> 05:26.347
And now you are a bird and you cannot
go back to the shell again.

05:28.503 --> 05:33.466
Once you realize what Sahaja Yoga
has done for you

05:35.245 --> 05:40.354
and also realize what you have achieved
in that:

05:41.737 --> 05:49.140
that is you have achieved the knowledge,
knowledge of Kundalini

05:49.341 --> 05:54.790
which was a secret knowledge all these
years, absolutely secret knowledge.

05:54.991 --> 05:59.172
Nobody knew about it, it was all
underground.

05:59.373 --> 06:05.061
All the knowledge about Kundalini you have,
very clearly,

06:05.262 --> 06:09.387
without going to any college, school,
university, anywhere.

06:09.588 --> 06:13.694
Without going to any laboratories you have
experimented with it,

06:13.895 --> 06:17.589
you’ve found out what is Kundalini.
You have seen with your own eyes,

06:17.790 --> 06:24.032
you’ve seen the rising of the Kundalini,
you have given Realization to people.

06:24.717 --> 06:29.557
Already you have experienced not only
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

06:29.758 --> 06:34.073
but you have also experienced your
own powers.

06:34.734 --> 06:45.116
Also you have seen that you have really
become

06:45.317 --> 06:49.823
so much different from what you were

06:51.044 --> 06:54.966
in your knowledge of understanding things.

06:55.167 --> 07:01.477
So, if your knowledge is so much with you

07:02.869 --> 07:06.405
and that you are entitled to raise
the Kundalini of others,

07:06.606 --> 07:11.948
which was not done by any great saints
before

07:12.149 --> 07:19.919
by any great Seers, Maharshis,
all these great people who lived.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.855
Only very, very few people had
this capacity

07:23.056 --> 07:30.133
to raise the Kundalini, all these years,
that you have got it.

07:30.334 --> 07:32.654
You understand what are the chakras

07:32.855 --> 07:37.355
and you can diagnose it, even the children
can do it.

07:37.567 --> 07:42.011
Which we don’t realize is something
so great!

07:44.279 --> 07:50.599
At a human level we didn’t know a word
about it.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.743
We never even had heard the word
‘Kundalini’!

07:53.944 --> 07:59.800
And in such a short time you have become
so knowledgeable!

08:00.938 --> 08:04.082
That’s the blessing of Sahaja Yoga.

08:04.283 --> 08:08.221
So, when you see this: that you have
so much knowledge

08:08.422 --> 08:12.589
and the light of your attention,
how it works.

08:12.790 --> 08:16.094
And then you see so many blessings
that work out

08:16.295 --> 08:23.150
and how automatically, just without
doing anything, you achieve results,

08:23.351 --> 08:32.269
you are amazed and you can’t understand
how it has happened, how it has worked out.

08:32.470 --> 08:38.519
Suddenly I was there, this happened.
Suddenly I was there, that happened. How?

08:38.720 --> 08:45.898
This ocean is every moment, into all
details, working out things.

08:48.982 --> 08:53.672
All these happenings should open
your eyes to the fact

08:53.873 --> 08:56.716
that you are no more like an ordinary
human being,

08:56.917 --> 09:00.853
that you are sages now, that you
are saints.

09:01.054 --> 09:04.406
So, our attitude has to be changed.

09:04.607 --> 09:08.157
So many human beings are still animals:
you can see the way they are killing,

09:08.358 --> 09:11.984
the way they are behaving - they are
not even human beings.

09:12.185 --> 09:15.627
We live with them, we see them every day:
they are criminals

09:15.828 --> 09:25.197
and not only that but they have very
low level of a culture in them.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.074
We can easily call them as animals.

09:28.275 --> 09:33.820
Then, we have some human beings who
are half animals and half human beings.

09:34.376 --> 09:40.844
Then, we have some human beings who
are really human beings, who are seekers.

09:41.268 --> 09:46.831
(Hindi) Let them come forward if they
want to. (Hindi)

09:50.593 --> 10:01.386
And this understanding of what you have
achieved in Sahaja Yoga

10:01.587 --> 10:08.411
should immediately make you realize
what you are.

10:11.624 --> 10:16.950
And when it all has happened to us,
automatically,

10:17.151 --> 10:21.043
you should be very sincere about it,

10:23.847 --> 10:28.093
you must feel that something really
you have achieved,

10:28.294 --> 10:31.046
there’s something so great,

10:31.247 --> 10:38.782
so we have to be sincere, mentally also
you should feel that way.

10:38.983 --> 10:45.110
So, this is first thing you do is
to mentally feel, to mentally feel

10:45.311 --> 10:54.143
that it’s so important, it is so -
it is so important,

10:54.420 --> 11:03.430
it is so valuable.

11:05.175 --> 11:09.103
You become very sincere about it.

11:10.750 --> 11:18.249
But the second part is different:

11:19.966 --> 11:25.348
where you see something, you know something

11:25.549 --> 11:30.070
and you start opening your heart about it.

11:30.594 --> 11:36.486
In the second part you have to open
your heart.

11:36.687 --> 11:41.232
So, the sincerity comes from an open heart:

11:42.648 --> 11:46.109
if your heart is not open, you cannot
be sincere.

11:46.310 --> 11:51.775
Now, what does it mean that your heart
is not open? Let us see.

11:55.592 --> 12:00.582
You are born again, you have got
your Realization.

12:00.783 --> 12:04.849
Also it is your birthday in a way.

12:05.050 --> 12:12.105
But in the growth of your knowledge
and understanding,

12:12.306 --> 12:16.872
you have not kept pace with your heart.

12:17.073 --> 12:24.366
But what is the reason for that? What is it
that keeps your heart like that?

12:27.300 --> 12:32.869
You can discover very easily that
your heart rules the body,

12:33.070 --> 12:36.193
rules your brain, everything.

12:36.394 --> 12:43.600
Because if your heart stops, everything
stops.

12:45.359 --> 12:48.826
But if your brain stops, heart won’t stop.

12:49.027 --> 12:55.819
So, heart is the most important thing and
it governs the whole being within you.

12:56.358 --> 13:05.960
Now, this special instrument, which is
very delicate,

13:06.227 --> 13:15.901
which circulates also, is like a stone.

13:16.102 --> 13:19.376
How will it pulsate?

13:21.647 --> 13:25.638
So, when we say ‘enlarge your heart’,

13:26.662 --> 13:32.351
it means that the stoniness of your heart
has to be melted away.

13:32.552 --> 13:39.723
But how does it become stony? We have
to go to the roots of that.

13:40.654 --> 13:48.208
It becomes like a stone because the heart
controls the brain.

13:49.172 --> 13:52.227
As there are seven auras on your brain,

13:52.428 --> 13:56.478
in the same way, there are seven auras
on your heart.

13:56.679 --> 14:05.464
And all those auras are the ones which
control the auras of the brain.

14:08.112 --> 14:16.466
Now, on the brain, as you know, there are
two institutions of ego and conditionings,

14:16.667 --> 14:24.445
which starts pressing the brain too much.
As a result, all these auras get pressed.

14:25.934 --> 14:31.548
So, the auras which are surrounding
the heart also get pressed.

14:32.024 --> 14:38.299
But brain can think:

14:38.500 --> 14:41.620
‘Yes, this is very good. I know how
to raise Kundalini, I know how to do this,

14:41.821 --> 14:45.775
everything I know’, part tells (?).

14:45.976 --> 14:51.508
It doesn’t become stony that way,
it can think.

14:51.709 --> 14:58.433
Anybody who is a stone-hearted fellow
can think. Like Hitler.

14:59.441 --> 15:08.497
So, the brain does not get affected
by the conditioning or the ego

15:08.698 --> 15:13.209
to such an extent that it becomes like
a stone, it cannot think.

15:13.410 --> 15:18.314
If it is ego too much… (Just closer
if you bring, it would be better.

15:18.515 --> 15:21.146
It goes on falling, I’m holding it on.)

15:21.347 --> 15:28.186
If it’s an ego, then a person may become
stupid, but he thinks, he thinks all right.

15:28.387 --> 15:34.575
He really becomes stupid. Anybody
who is an egoist,

15:34.776 --> 15:41.517
whose Agnya is catching, becomes
a stupid fellow, no doubt about it.

15:41.718 --> 15:47.588
You see in his behaviour, whenever
he talks, the way he is trying

15:47.789 --> 15:54.141
to do anything, he’s such a show-off
and he becomes a stupid fellow.

15:54.342 --> 15:59.353
Any wise person can see that, that
he is such a stupid man.

15:59.554 --> 16:12.863
So, what we find, that mind is covered
with the superego

16:13.064 --> 16:20.318
but it does not make a person with
a brain which is stony.

16:20.519 --> 16:32.875
On the contrary, it makes a person
a stupid person, not a stone-headed.

16:33.974 --> 16:39.348
And such a stupid man can go on
talking all kinds of things.

16:39.549 --> 16:45.778
And you can immediately recognize
such a stupid man, not difficult.

16:46.054 --> 16:49.949
The other side of this is the conditionings
in the mind.

16:50.150 --> 16:53.204
That’s even a worse thing, very sly.

16:53.405 --> 16:58.359
Because somebody has the conditionings,
he doesn’t come out of it.

16:58.560 --> 17:02.622
He doesn’t show off, but he's sly

17:02.823 --> 17:10.759
and his brain is covered with such ideas
which are asahaj.

17:11.081 --> 17:17.582
Like somebody saw Me, in a Puja, washing
My hands and giving that water;

17:17.804 --> 17:24.801
he said: ‘Why do you take the water which
is washed, which is washing Mother’s hands?’

17:25.002 --> 17:29.373
So, the other one said: ‘Mother has got
such tremendous vibrations in Her hands,

17:29.574 --> 17:35.915
that when we wash them, the vibrations
come in.’

17:36.116 --> 17:40.200
Oh, he couldn’t believe it! Because
the conditionings are

17:40.400 --> 17:44.558
that whenever you wash your hands,
only the dirt comes out.

17:44.759 --> 17:47.691
So, they can’t think of vibrations.

17:47.892 --> 17:52.242
All such conditionings are there
in the mind of people.

17:52.443 --> 17:58.289
Because of these conditionings they
cannot take to heart.

17:58.490 --> 18:05.066
But what happens that they think about it
in a very sly manner,

18:05.267 --> 18:14.506
tell lies, talk nonsensical things and
try to convince you that they are right.

18:16.240 --> 18:22.593
They are not stupid, but they are idiotic.

18:23.621 --> 18:26.646
They talk like idiots.

18:26.847 --> 18:32.542
And that idiotic thing you accept!
There’s no wisdom in it.

18:32.743 --> 18:38.589
So, one fellow is a stupid fellow,
another one is an idiot.

18:38.790 --> 18:43.656
Between the two lies the Sahaja Yogi.

18:44.314 --> 18:56.039
So, this conditioning makes the brain
pervert,

18:56.240 --> 19:05.552
but it doesn’t make it a stone.
Only what makes it a stone

19:07.604 --> 19:12.684
is that if he is born with some sort
of a mental derangement,

19:12.885 --> 19:17.453
that he cannot think, otherwise the brain
goes on thinking.

19:17.654 --> 19:22.428
Whether with conditionings or with ego,
it goes on thinking.

19:24.391 --> 19:27.338
Such a brain

19:30.171 --> 19:35.413
should not affect the heart, because
heart affects the brain.

19:35.614 --> 19:41.000
But the auras which are manifested
from the heart

19:41.201 --> 19:47.089
start becoming dull or disappearing.

19:47.565 --> 19:52.584
So the auras around the heart are
very sensitive

19:52.785 --> 19:58.219
and they feel: ‘No use throwing light
on the brain’.

19:58.840 --> 20:06.568
They start becoming smaller and smaller
and that’s how the heart becomes small.

20:07.794 --> 20:13.631
Because they have no purpose in life there,
so they start becoming smaller and smaller.

20:13.832 --> 20:16.459
As a result, the heart becomes small.

20:16.660 --> 20:21.774
You call somebody as very small-hearted
fellow, is a chicken-hearted fellow

20:21.975 --> 20:26.693
or we always say such a man is
a ‘stone-hearted person’.

20:26.894 --> 20:29.659
All this happens

20:30.713 --> 20:35.440
because of the conditionings and the ego
of the human mind

20:35.648 --> 20:46.649
and the result is felt by the heart
becoming a stone,

20:46.850 --> 20:52.631
because heart is a sensitive thing.
Brain is not that sensitive.

20:52.832 --> 20:58.080
If you put something soft in the water,
it becomes hard,

20:58.280 --> 21:03.423
but if you put a stone in the water
and boil it, it won’t.

21:03.947 --> 21:08.239
So, heart being very sensitive and delicate
becomes like a stone,

21:08.440 --> 21:13.057
like as you boil in the heat of the brain
waves.

21:13.258 --> 21:18.474
And it becomes a very hard stone.
It does not know

21:18.675 --> 21:24.294
how to say even one word which is nice.

21:25.631 --> 21:27.999
It goes on hitting people all the time,

21:28.200 --> 21:32.747
saying things which one should not
have said,

21:33.470 --> 21:39.430
all the time thinking, ‘What should we say
to hurt another person?

21:40.160 --> 21:45.199
How should I try to really mislead
another person?’

21:45.400 --> 21:48.542
because it’s a sly attitude.

21:49.585 --> 21:58.184
The ego part, the heart becomes again
frozen with ego

21:58.385 --> 22:02.146
and then the heart thinks - not thinks,

22:02.347 --> 22:07.520
but heart cannot emit any auras
to the brain.

22:07.721 --> 22:12.616
The brain starts thinking that, ‘Now,
the area of heart is finished.

22:12.817 --> 22:18.414
The heart cannot control us any more.’
Then heart starts thinking that,

22:18.615 --> 22:23.543
‘I will do all the work myself.’ I mean,
the head starts saying.

22:23.744 --> 22:27.309
And the heart becomes small, stony.
It doesn’t act.

22:27.510 --> 22:32.956
So now, the brain takes over. The brain
takes over and then brain starts.

22:33.157 --> 22:39.393
Brain starts itself acting in a manner
that we can’t understand:

22:39.594 --> 22:45.956
they behave like animals, they behave
like satanic people, they become very cruel

22:46.157 --> 22:52.940
and they do not know how to really say
something good to others.

22:53.141 --> 22:56.562
There’s a kind of a very false pride
in them

22:56.763 --> 23:02.249
and such people go on hurting others,
insulting others

23:02.450 --> 23:08.569
till they meet another one like them
and then both of them collapse.

23:11.494 --> 23:14.407
That’s the only snag in the whole thing,

23:14.608 --> 23:17.242
otherwise, you would have been finished
by now.

23:17.443 --> 23:25.279
But because the two persons with ego cannot
be together, they neutralize each other.

23:25.480 --> 23:29.821
So thank God we are saved from them.

23:30.535 --> 23:37.489
So these two conditionings, which actually
are on the brain,

23:37.690 --> 23:49.872
these two conditions freeze the heart and
also make the domain of heart as zero

23:50.073 --> 23:54.776
and then the brain starts asserting itself.

23:56.883 --> 24:01.963
That is how we do not know how to be
kind to others,

24:02.164 --> 24:06.385
how to be nice, how to be helpful,
how to be gentle

24:06.586 --> 24:13.382
and how to be reassuring, protecting
others.

24:14.830 --> 24:22.001
All this we have inherited already.

24:22.202 --> 24:25.736
We have already got a stone heart
when we come to Sahaja Yoga

24:25.937 --> 24:30.177
and we have a brain either full of ego
or superego.

24:30.378 --> 24:36.842
So now, with your Kundalini rising, you can
clear out your head, first of all.

24:37.043 --> 24:42.045
So, the sincerity will come when
the Kundalini will move

24:42.246 --> 24:49.355
and touch your Brahmarandhra, which is
the seat of your heart and will expand.

24:49.556 --> 24:53.192
Then the heart just comes back
like a king, returns back

24:53.393 --> 24:56.926
and starts dominating the brain.

24:57.127 --> 25:00.636
And when the heart comes back,
you immediately find

25:00.837 --> 25:02.735
those people with whom we were angry,

25:02.936 --> 25:06.644
we would not talk, we had nothing to do,
suddenly, we become friendly with them.

25:06.845 --> 25:13.596
There’s no problem. In many ways,
people have harmed you.

25:13.797 --> 25:18.776
All that harming and everything just
disappears.

25:18.977 --> 25:22.823
And you start becoming so nice
and beautiful.

25:23.024 --> 25:26.830
What has happened that Kundalini has
touched your Brahmarandhra,

25:27.031 --> 25:31.376
where is the seat of heart. And as soon
as that opens out,

25:31.577 --> 25:36.531
your heart also opens and it gets awakened.
It thinks, ‘Oh, what?

25:36.732 --> 25:40.493
I have allowed this brain to rule me?
How dare it rules me!’

25:40.694 --> 25:45.159
It just jumps on it. And we have seen
people:

25:45.360 --> 25:49.951
suddenly, they’re so much transformed
that it’s remarkable.

25:50.152 --> 25:54.778
There - one gentleman in America,
he said that, ‘Mother, after Realization

25:54.979 --> 26:02.327
I was so much changed that I’ve become
a very mild person

26:02.528 --> 26:05.608
and I never used to wish my uncle
or anyone.’

26:05.809 --> 26:10.352
So he met him in some sort of a fete
and then he said, ‘Hello, uncle!’

26:10.553 --> 26:16.389
The uncle started looking at him. ‘Are you
all right?’ He would never say that.

26:16.590 --> 26:20.389
Then he went and saw: ‘Are you all right,
uncle? Are you keeping all right?

26:20.590 --> 26:23.393
Can I do something for you?’
Very nice things he said.

26:23.594 --> 26:28.070
Uncle said, ‘What have you been doing?
Are you drunk or what?

26:28.271 --> 26:32.805
How can you speak so sweetly to me?
I can’t believe it.’

26:33.393 --> 26:37.220
That’s what happens. And that’s why
we have to understand

26:37.421 --> 26:41.145
that all these things can be easily
dropped out

26:41.346 --> 26:46.493
because we have acquired them. They can be
finished off because we have acquired them.

26:46.694 --> 26:51.239
They need not be all our lives,
our relations.

26:51.440 --> 26:56.343
So, ego and superego, both can be
blasted off

26:56.544 --> 26:59.070
once your heart is awakened.

26:59.271 --> 27:05.959
So, when we are dealing with people,
we have to break the ice also

27:06.160 --> 27:10.121
by communicating with others in a very
decent manner.

27:10.322 --> 27:15.265
Like telling yourself, ‘No, I don't believe
that this man is so bad.

27:15.466 --> 27:20.673
Let me look after him, he may be all right.
You see, I don’t think he’s so bad.’

27:20.874 --> 27:24.763
So, to accept somebody as bad is very
easy for human beings

27:24.964 --> 27:27.353
and once they start accepting such a thing,

27:27.554 --> 27:30.314
then they build up a kind of a fortress
in which they live

27:30.515 --> 27:35.901
and they think they are the best people
and nobody else are good.

27:36.102 --> 27:40.142
And thus, the whole community, the whole
society,

27:40.343 --> 27:45.635
the whole humanity gets bitten
by these ideas.

27:49.062 --> 27:55.246
And Sahaja Yoga is the only way which
is going to cure it.

27:55.447 --> 28:00.845
Sahaja Yoga is the only way which is going
to finish this.

28:01.046 --> 28:07.536
And that part is to be played
by you people,

28:07.737 --> 28:11.797
to understand that sincerity can only
come if you raise

28:11.998 --> 28:17.646
your Kundalini again and again and open
your Brahmarandhra.

28:17.847 --> 28:26.239
Then your heart will rise. It will become
a very awakened personality

28:26.440 --> 28:28.538
and it will take charge of your brain,

28:28.739 --> 28:32.573
which is all the time thinking, thinking,
thinking, like mad.

28:32.774 --> 28:35.824
And once that happens, then you will
realize

28:36.025 --> 28:40.385
that now you have jumped into doubtless
awareness.

28:42.174 --> 28:46.836
So, the relationship between the two
has to be fully understood.

28:47.042 --> 28:52.217
At first, the domination of the heart or,
we can say, the kinghood of heart

28:52.418 --> 28:56.799
is challenged, is put down, brought
to zero.

28:57.000 --> 29:02.269
And then this brain becomes the king,
and it starts ruling us.

29:02.470 --> 29:11.821
‘I think…’, ‘I feel…’ means the brain,
the ego.

29:12.022 --> 29:22.459
If you could give up ‘I think…’, ‘I want…’,
everything will be all right.

29:22.660 --> 29:27.983
You should say, ‘“I want…” is not
the point. This body wants it.’

29:28.634 --> 29:33.343
You separate yourself. Gradually you start
separating yourself

29:33.544 --> 29:36.357
from all such situations by never saying
‘I want…’

29:36.558 --> 29:41.876
You should say, ‘This body…’,
‘This hand…’, ‘This head…’

29:42.077 --> 29:45.078
You start separating. And once you have
separated,

29:45.279 --> 29:51.187
all these barriers of ego and superego
will disappear.

29:51.388 --> 29:57.078
But, as it is, also it’s very easy to get
rid of these two.

29:57.279 --> 29:59.871
It’s very easy to get rid of these two.

30:00.072 --> 30:06.045
Only by raising your Kundalini and breaking
your Brahmarandhra.

30:06.246 --> 30:08.985
This is the greatest achievement that
you have got,

30:09.186 --> 30:11.861
that you can break your Brahmarandhra,

30:12.062 --> 30:15.857
make your Kundalini get connected
with the All-pervading Power.

30:16.058 --> 30:18.171
That’s why I always say you must meditate

30:18.372 --> 30:21.776
and you must be in thoughtless awareness,
then it works out.

30:21.977 --> 30:24.803
Don’t pay attention to outside things
so much.

30:25.004 --> 30:36.142
Of course, you are, in a way, responsible
for Sahaja Yoga,

30:36.343 --> 30:41.724
because you are sincere about it.
You cannot force yourself.

30:41.925 --> 30:45.525
So, again and again I say, you weigh
your sincerity.

30:45.726 --> 30:49.799
‘How sincere am I to Sahaja Yoga?’

30:54.394 --> 30:58.719
And some people just take it frivolously,

30:58.920 --> 31:05.831
saying ‘Mother, I was silly, I was
confused.’ You cannot say that!

31:08.741 --> 31:16.805
You cannot say, because you owe
these things to Sahaja Yoga.

31:17.006 --> 31:22.324
Everything you owe to Sahaja Yoga now.
It’s a new life to you.

31:22.525 --> 31:29.465
So you cannot say, ‘I was confused’
or ‘I was silly, I was stupid, I did this.’

31:29.666 --> 31:32.088
You tell yourself you can’t do it.

31:32.289 --> 31:35.393
Mother has really worked very hard
with full sincerity

31:35.594 --> 31:40.963
and we cannot be insincere about it.
We don’t want to be hypocrites.

31:41.751 --> 31:50.598
This is hypocrisy, absolute hypocrisy.
You say something and do something.

31:50.799 --> 31:56.400
If you have any sense of gratitude and
self-respect, then you should never say that

31:56.601 --> 32:02.198
‘By mistake, I did this, Mother’ or ‘I was
confused, I was silly, I was stupid.’

32:02.399 --> 32:06.393
That shows you are a very mediocre person
and you have no sense

32:06.594 --> 32:12.070
of gratitude towards Sahaja Yoga
nor towards yourself.

32:12.271 --> 32:17.414
But the best part of it, that I don’t need
Sahaja Yog

32:17.615 --> 32:23.510
and that Sahaja Yoga does not need you.
You need Sahaja Yoga.

32:24.391 --> 32:28.425
In itself, Sahaja Yoga is complete.
It does not need you.

32:28.626 --> 32:37.222
It is a complete thing, will remain
like that, absolutely.

32:39.154 --> 32:43.660
It will have its own position,

32:43.861 --> 32:49.278
its own status, its own dignity,
everything intact.

32:49.479 --> 32:56.319
But if you have to get something out of it,
you have to work it out.

32:56.520 --> 33:01.209
Like from the river Ganges, if you have
to fetch the water,

33:01.410 --> 33:06.140
you must have proper pitchers which are
deep enough to receive the water.

33:06.341 --> 33:09.588
But if you take a stone, what can you
bring out of it?

33:09.789 --> 33:15.722
But the Ganges flows. It is what it is.
It has its own capacities in it.

33:15.923 --> 33:20.218
It doesn’t change because you people
have taken stones.

33:20.419 --> 33:25.748
So now you have to understand that raise
your Kundalini as many times as you can.

33:25.949 --> 33:29.119
Try to put attention to your Kundalini
all the time.

33:29.320 --> 33:33.161
See where is the problem is. Get it
cleared out, absolutely cleared out.

33:33.362 --> 33:37.619
Find out where is the problem is and raise
your Kundalini many a times

33:37.820 --> 33:43.230
and see that you are flowing all right
on your fontanel bone area,

33:43.431 --> 33:45.880
so that your heart expands.

33:46.081 --> 33:49.350
It’s a mechanical process in a way,
you can say.

33:49.551 --> 33:51.712
But even that you people don’t do.

33:51.913 --> 33:54.350
If you had done that, your heart would
have increased.

33:54.551 --> 34:00.499
And you yourself will say, ‘Mother,
my heart has become large like Asia.’

34:00.700 --> 34:05.580
And then you see the miracle of the heart,
how it emits vibrations

34:05.781 --> 34:09.524
by which you become such compassionate,
such dynamic,

34:09.725 --> 34:14.456
beautiful people and so sincere
to Sahaja Yoga.

34:15.820 --> 34:19.599
I would request you to open your heart
today for this puja.

34:19.800 --> 34:21.767
You have been very jubilant and happy.

34:21.968 --> 34:25.355
And must be your heart must have opened
because I’ve seen Sahaja Yogis

34:25.556 --> 34:30.761
have a very large heart for Me, but
for themselves they don’t have.

34:30.962 --> 34:35.743
They’ll do everything for Me, but nothing
for themselves.

34:35.944 --> 34:39.528
They’ll work morning till evening
to decorate the hall, to do everything.

34:39.734 --> 34:43.413
They must have sent all these flowers
to Me from I don’t know where.

34:43.614 --> 34:48.483
But if I tell them, ‘You meditate for
yourself’, that they will not do.

34:49.358 --> 34:53.464
Or ‘You achieve this for yourself’,
that they will not do.

34:53.959 --> 34:56.217
This is the situation.

34:56.418 --> 35:00.944
So, instead of wasting all your energy
for decorating all these things,

35:01.145 --> 35:04.058
you should decorate yourself
within yourself.

35:04.259 --> 35:07.197
With sincerity, with nice thoughts
about yourself

35:07.398 --> 35:11.677
that you are capable, absolutely capable
people

35:11.878 --> 35:17.365
and you can use your imagination,

35:17.566 --> 35:22.450
your intelligence, rationality, whatever
you think you have,

35:22.651 --> 35:31.300
to find the way, to find the way, again
I say, to keep your heart large.

35:32.895 --> 35:37.952
And this is the message for today’s
birthday all over the world

35:38.153 --> 35:45.134
because I felt that the whole world was
today like a big heart pulsating.

35:45.335 --> 35:50.131
I received the last phone and came here.

35:54.077 --> 35:56.998
From all over the phones coming,

35:57.199 --> 36:01.127
flowers are showering, the beautiful nice
things they are saying.

36:01.328 --> 36:06.313
Everything is there. When I am just
drenched into it,

36:06.514 --> 36:11.150
just drenched, it was too much for Me.
Such sweet, sweet things for the children,

36:11.351 --> 36:13.902
from the children, such things from
the ladies,

36:14.103 --> 36:18.924
some very, very nice from the men
and it was amazing

36:19.125 --> 36:25.670
how these people are bubbling with
enjoyment that today is My birthday.

36:27.080 --> 36:33.102
In the same way, please consider that
every day is your birthday,

36:33.303 --> 36:36.346
that you have to raise your Kundalini
all the time

36:36.547 --> 36:40.898
and keep the standard of your Kundalini
higher and higher.

36:41.099 --> 36:45.372
The more you open out, the more threads
of Kundalini will come up

36:45.573 --> 36:50.202
and the more your heart will open out

36:50.403 --> 36:53.858
and it will be awakened, it will become
more powerful.

36:54.059 --> 36:57.274
And with an open, big heart and a powerful
heart,

36:57.475 --> 37:02.686
you can dominate your brain, which is
giving you all these funny ideas.

37:02.983 --> 37:06.921
I hope this will happen this year here

37:07.122 --> 37:13.846
and people will try to make it a point
that we have a large heart.

37:14.047 --> 37:17.621
Large heart doesn’t mean stupidity,
doesn’t mean that.

37:17.822 --> 37:24.812
Large heart means the heart in which
you can put Me in.

37:26.471 --> 37:30.221
It’s quite a big person, Myself,

37:30.422 --> 37:34.878
so you have to have a very large heart
that I could reside into your heart.

37:35.079 --> 37:39.239
That is the large heart and that’s what
you all should have.

37:39.440 --> 37:43.854
If that happens, then everything
will work out very well.

37:44.055 --> 37:49.114
So, the surrendering part of it: you must
know how to surrender

37:49.315 --> 37:53.079
and you must know how to keep whatever
is not surrendered,

37:53.280 --> 37:57.378
because you surrender yourself

37:57.791 --> 38:04.312
in such a manner that you expand
your heart absolutely.

38:04.513 --> 38:10.586
Put Me down there and then keep
your flowers with you

38:10.787 --> 38:20.177
to be given to Me at a time when you are
in complete control of yourself.

38:20.378 --> 38:25.824
So you have your emotions, your feelings
like flowers,

38:26.025 --> 38:32.331
that you have to keep to yourself, which are
the part of the same ocean of your heart.

38:32.532 --> 38:41.183
And, once you are ready, everything is
done, if the whole house is ready,

38:41.384 --> 38:44.497
now bring the flowers, the emotions,

38:44.698 --> 38:48.968
the nice things, the beautiful things
and nourish them.

38:49.169 --> 38:52.251
One must learn, I think, there should
be some books

38:52.452 --> 38:57.167
about how to say nice things to others.

38:57.368 --> 39:01.696
We should try to find some books like that
or should write some books

39:01.897 --> 39:06.485
how nice things could be said, how we can
take care of others,

39:06.686 --> 39:14.385
how we can make another feel our love,
the expression of love,

39:14.586 --> 39:18.516
and that work, such a book will really
help people to understand

39:18.717 --> 39:23.458
that this is nice to say. And once you say
something nice to other,

39:23.659 --> 39:28.360
that niceness comes back, as I have
told you,

39:28.561 --> 39:31.439
like the ripples that touch the shores
come back

39:31.640 --> 39:38.558
and then you feel very happy. Go on saying
things which are nice,

39:38.759 --> 39:43.160
which are pleasing, will be very much
appreciated.

39:43.360 --> 39:47.314
But if you say it with sincerity, not just
to tease someone

39:47.515 --> 39:51.536
or to say something, just to be so
superficially good,

39:51.737 --> 39:57.168
like ‘Thank you, thank you, thank you,’ but
something from your heart, as they say,

39:57.369 --> 40:01.617
then you will be surprised that the heart
of the another person will open

40:01.818 --> 40:09.315
and from that heart will flow those
beautiful flowers of emotions towards you.

40:09.516 --> 40:14.432
So, on one side, you have to expand
your heart and on another side,

40:14.633 --> 40:17.690
you have to reserve or preserve

40:17.891 --> 40:21.781
all the beautiful, nice, delicate feelings
within yourself,

40:21.982 --> 40:26.358
absorbed from everywhere and then
to pour them out at the right point.

40:26.559 --> 40:29.251
That’s the art.

40:30.158 --> 40:34.565
Like these flowers were in the garden first
to begin with, preserved, preserved.

40:34.766 --> 40:38.903
At the right time they were brought in.
So they feel more glorified

40:39.104 --> 40:41.397
that they are used at the right time.

40:41.598 --> 40:45.710
This is the way we have to be with
ourselves in our heart

40:45.911 --> 40:52.670
because human beings are very delicate,
very beautiful things

40:52.871 --> 40:56.619
and to beautify them you have to say
beautiful things.

40:56.820 --> 41:02.319
This tongue is not for saying harsh things,
for making fun of others,

41:02.520 --> 41:07.550
for teasing others, but is for saying
something, such a beautiful thing

41:07.751 --> 41:13.266
that the another person also imbibes
that beauty.

41:14.228 --> 41:19.763
I’ve seen some nice things people have said
and that lingers in My mind.

41:19.964 --> 41:24.259
And I said, ‘When will I have chance to say
these things to others?’

41:24.460 --> 41:27.796
So, think about it, that ‘Now this is
a very nice sentence,'

41:27.997 --> 41:34.738
‘This was a very sweet thing they said.
All right. So now, where should I use this?’

41:34.939 --> 41:38.393
As I go to the shops, I see something:
‘Ah, that’s good.

41:38.594 --> 41:41.803
That will be good for particular person.
Let’s buy that.’

41:42.004 --> 41:45.919
In the same way, if you find these nice
feelings

41:46.120 --> 41:51.629
and nice emotions and nice things said,
then what do you do?

41:51.830 --> 41:56.397
You collect them, all these things,
keep them and use them

41:56.598 --> 42:04.246
at the right time, at the right place. This
is what is the wisdom of Shri Ganesha.

42:04.446 --> 42:10.435
Innocent people are the most sincere
people, innocent people.

42:10.636 --> 42:14.415
Those who are clever and cunning cannot
be sincere

42:14.616 --> 42:16.664
because they enjoy their cunningness,

42:16.865 --> 42:22.584
they enjoy their so-called ‘brilliance”.
They can never be.

42:22.785 --> 42:31.509
Those people who are simple, who are
loving,

42:31.710 --> 42:36.247
who care for love more than anything else,

42:36.448 --> 42:43.763
can only say very nice things sincerely.

42:43.964 --> 42:54.129
Today I wanted to say many things to you,
how I feel

42:54.330 --> 43:02.148
about this birthday in Australia,
but I told you the words fail.

43:02.349 --> 43:05.429
Because - see, Australia is such
a far-off country.

43:05.630 --> 43:12.429
To come here with so many people sitting
and singing ‘Agata Swagata’.

43:12.630 --> 43:17.148
It is unbelievable, unbelievable,

43:17.349 --> 43:20.670
because I have not given you any money,
you have not given Me any money,

43:20.870 --> 43:24.930
you are not bound to say anything
like that.

43:26.288 --> 43:31.665
But not only that you are doing it, but
you are enjoying it.

43:32.197 --> 43:35.680
It’s something great. You’re enjoying it
and that’s what it is:

43:35.881 --> 43:40.904
that when your heart is large, then
whatever you do for others, you enjoy.

43:41.105 --> 43:44.773
You enjoy doing good things. You enjoy
saying nice things.

43:44.974 --> 43:49.735
So we should have choicest flowers
of beautiful sayings,

43:49.936 --> 43:53.399
we should have choicest emotions

43:53.600 --> 43:56.839
which we should be able to express
to each other.

43:57.040 --> 44:01.464
Now start on that from today, I have
to say: you start on this,

44:01.665 --> 44:05.716
that from 1990 we are all the time
going to speak

44:05.917 --> 44:09.919
something beautiful to each other
all the time

44:10.120 --> 44:15.783
and just keep your ears open, keep your
eyes open and wherever you get a chance,

44:15.984 --> 44:21.878
wherever you hear something like that,
keep it in your mind and use it back.

44:22.079 --> 44:28.271
Today I am so enamored and it is too much
for Me, really,

44:28.472 --> 44:33.329
to believe even that there are so many
Sahaja Yogis

44:33.530 --> 44:37.430
in Australia, which is so far away.

44:37.631 --> 44:42.778
Now it is your responsibility. It is
your responsibility

44:42.979 --> 44:48.548
to be sincere about Sahaja Yoga, and in all
sincerity, if you do everything,

44:48.749 --> 44:53.359
you’ll never think of such funny arguments
which I’ve heard before.

44:53.560 --> 44:59.028
You’ll just think that, ‘We love Mother
and we have together, to be together,

44:59.229 --> 45:01.825
and we have to love each other
and all the time

45:02.026 --> 45:08.099
we have to say nice things to each other
so that the love increases.’

45:09.470 --> 45:16.975
Anything else, anybody who tries to say
things

45:18.491 --> 45:25.841
or break things or breaks somebody’s heart
are doing sinful things. There’s sin.

45:26.042 --> 45:28.766
To break the heart of a saint is
the greatest sin

45:28.967 --> 45:31.886
and they’ll be punished for that.

45:32.087 --> 45:37.941
So, now you are all saints and sages,
you have to respect each other.

45:38.142 --> 45:46.832
Not only that, but you have to be enjoying
your sincerity.

45:47.033 --> 45:50.479
That’s the way, I’m trying to say,
enjoy your sincerity.

45:50.680 --> 45:54.499
And all these stupid thoughts come
into your head, throw them away.

45:54.700 --> 45:57.699
Because I heard of so many arguments
here and there and I thought,

45:57.900 --> 46:02.824
‘What is this? They are Sahaja Yogis or
they are ordinary people of the street?’

46:03.025 --> 46:06.098
This is happening and then the children,
this happening, that.

46:06.299 --> 46:11.020
Now, about children also, I’ve been telling
you that: send your children to India.

46:11.221 --> 46:14.185
In any case, you have been selfish
about them.

46:14.386 --> 46:18.817
You know they are not developing all right.
So send them to India.

46:19.018 --> 46:23.220
In that you have opened your heart because
the whole world is your relation,

46:23.421 --> 46:29.183
the whole world is your family. You go
anywhere in the whole world, you will find

46:29.384 --> 46:34.627
people who’ll love you, who’ll care for
you, who’ll do everything for you.

46:34.828 --> 46:38.338
I mean, to know that in every place
there is somebody sitting

46:38.539 --> 46:43.429
just waiting to meet you as your own!

46:43.630 --> 46:46.600
Just now I was thinking, ‘These musicians
are going to Singapore.

46:46.800 --> 46:50.244
What will happen? Where will they stay?’
Big problem,

46:50.445 --> 46:53.858
trying this and that. Suddenly, I gave
a bandhan,

46:54.059 --> 46:56.952
phone came from Bala. Bala told Me that,

46:57.153 --> 47:02.333
‘No, it’s perfectly all right. I’ll tell
my mother. She’ll look after them.’

47:02.947 --> 47:06.303
Problem solved. So, any such problems,

47:06.504 --> 47:09.767
your problems can be solved because
you are sincere,

47:09.968 --> 47:16.737
but if you’re insincere, you’ll meet only
insincere people and then you’ll go down,

47:16.975 --> 47:20.676
go down into your own estimation
and estimation of others.

47:20.877 --> 47:23.147
And you’ll have no place in Sahaja Yoga.

47:23.348 --> 47:26.500
There’s no place for insincere people
in Sahaj Yoga,

47:26.701 --> 47:29.980
so try to develop your sincerity.
Raise your Kundalini

47:30.181 --> 47:35.572
as many times as you can. Keep it there.
Keep it on Sahastrara

47:35.773 --> 47:39.888
and see that your heart opens.
That’s the best way.

47:40.089 --> 47:42.510
They’ve been all asking Me, ‘How to open
our heart?’

47:42.711 --> 47:46.617
I said, ‘Take the key.’ Now, I don’t know
how to tell them.

47:46.818 --> 47:50.764
‘Open your heart’ means just raise
your Kundalini,

47:50.965 --> 47:55.326
keep to the Brahmarandhra and see that
the Brahmarandhra opens.

47:55.527 --> 47:58.522
Not only that, but you see how

47:58.737 --> 48:02.690
by expanding your heart, by being nice
to others, how you feel.

48:02.891 --> 48:08.003
There are some people who do not talk
much, who do not meet others,

48:08.204 --> 48:12.430
who have reservations. They live as if they
are living in the air, sort of people,

48:12.631 --> 48:16.278
must know there must be some badhas,
some bhoots sitting on their heads,

48:16.479 --> 48:21.319
otherwise that’s a very unnatural behavior
for a Sahaja Yogi.

48:21.520 --> 48:25.841
I’ve told you so many things today because
I think the care,

48:26.042 --> 48:34.144
the love, the affection, the wisdom
and the patience is to be imbibed.

48:34.345 --> 48:42.186
If I’m your Guru, if I am your Mother,
you have to imbibe these qualities.

48:42.622 --> 48:46.554
For everything I’m worried. If somebody’s
in trouble, I’m worried.

48:46.755 --> 48:52.004
I’ll try to get the problems sorted out
of that person.

48:52.205 --> 49:00.694
Anyone who has a problem, I just - that
sticks to Me till I have solved the problem.

49:00.895 --> 49:03.559
And I tell frankly also about, say,
your children,

49:03.760 --> 49:07.480
I tell about your wife, about your husband
that, ‘This is not all right.

49:07.681 --> 49:12.663
This must be corrected’. Because I care
for you.

49:13.550 --> 49:17.414
This is what should be your attitude
towards

49:17.621 --> 49:24.491
Sahaja Yogis, Sahaja Yoga and that will
strengthen you so much,

49:24.692 --> 49:27.727
because you care, that’s why others care.

49:27.928 --> 49:34.196
Can you imagine for an Indian woman like Me
to have so many people who care for Me?

49:34.550 --> 49:40.401
Why should they care for Me, after all?
All right, you are Sahaja Yogis,

49:40.602 --> 49:44.626
but there are people who are not
Sahaja Yogis, I tell you,

49:44.827 --> 49:48.169
whom I, they are not Sahaja Yogis,
whom I have met from My childhood,

49:48.370 --> 49:51.062
whom I know, my relations, - they all
care for Me!

49:51.263 --> 49:56.400
Just one thing, because I care for them,
I get bothered about them.

49:56.601 --> 50:03.153
Anybody who tells Me a problem, it is
in My head, sticks there like a stamp.

50:03.361 --> 50:10.004
Till I’ve solved the problem, I’ll be
looking out how to fix that problem.

50:10.433 --> 50:13.806
And I don’t have any problem of My own.

50:14.007 --> 50:17.101
In the same way, you should not have
any problems of your own.

50:17.302 --> 50:21.294
Then only you can manage. All right now?

50:21.495 --> 50:23.952
So may God bless you!

50:24.966 --> 50:32.161
Next year I hope you all will be there
for My birthday in India.

50:32.362 --> 50:37.023
We are going to organize the tour program
like that, perhaps may be worked out.

50:37.224 --> 50:41.228
We have to also see if you can make
something

50:41.429 --> 50:47.145
cheaper there to come down. We have
to see many things. We can work it out.

51:04.745 --> 51:10.455
Before puja if you could give yourself
bandhan nicely, seven times

51:10.656 --> 51:15.150
and then rise you Kundalini that would
be better.
