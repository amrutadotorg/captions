00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.926
Today is the eighth day of Navaratri,

00:00:12.006 --> 00:00:27.715
and it is great day for Sahaja Yogis
because it is the most important time, period.

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:36.677
That is, the seventh centre, we have
crossed, and we are on the eighth centre.

00:00:36.757 --> 00:00:42.672
We need not think about the
Goddess what She did on the eighth day,

00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:46.863
we have to think today what we have to do within ourselves.

00:00:46.943 --> 00:00:49.689
After crossing the seventh day,

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.690
after crossing the seventh chakra

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.187
that is the real ascent in your spiritual ascent.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.839
What are we to do on the eighth one?

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:05.995
It’s so Sahaja that today should be the Ashtami,

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:15.190
because that is the day the Goddess killed
so may evil doers, and devils and Rakshasas.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.307
She did it on Her own, alone.

00:01:19.387 --> 00:01:25.765
Now these evil forces are manifesting in human beings.

00:01:25.845 --> 00:01:29.065
They have spread out.
They are within us.

00:01:29.145 --> 00:01:32.985
So we all have to fight those forces within us.

00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:38.391
The war is within ourselves, is not without.

00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:47.095
First when you ascend the seventh
chakra and you are on the eighth step,

00:01:47.175 --> 00:01:51.919
you have to remember first you have
to fight those forces within ourselves.

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:56.529
You are all very intelligent
people; bit too intelligent sometimes.

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:06.238
So whatever I say you may twist it, and
may try to use it in your own intelligence.

00:02:06.318 --> 00:02:12.275
But it is not in your well-being. It
is not for your ‘hita’, for your good.

00:02:12.355 --> 00:02:17.089
You want to use it because you think you are intelligent,

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:22.605
and maybe you do not know you are using it that way.

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:27.860
And that is what one has to know
that these forces are acting within us.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.320
They act through our intelligence,
they act through our emotions,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.159
and they act through our physical being.

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.651
So we have to be very careful.

00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:45.788
When you ascend into Sahaja Yoga, we
have to be very careful with our intelligence,

00:02:45.868 --> 00:02:49.049
because intelligence has capacity to cheat itself.

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.391
And it will cheat us, nobody else.

00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:57.822
It is against us, against our own
wealth, against our own power.

00:02:57.902 --> 00:03:01.821
So we have to be alert and see for ourselves.

00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:08.237
So as soon as you enter onto the eighth
step you should start seeing at yourself.

00:03:08.317 --> 00:03:14.669
Now, for example, when I say
the mantra is “I am my own Guru”,

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:20.327
immediately the intelligence comes
forward to render its services-freely.

00:03:20.407 --> 00:03:23.634
“Oh! I am my own Guru, why should I listen to anyone?

00:03:23.714 --> 00:03:27.936
Why should I listen to any leader? Why
should I listen to anyone else who is elder,

00:03:28.016 --> 00:03:31.461
who understands Sahaja Yoga better? I am my own Guru!”

00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:36.523
It is the other way. Straightforward thing is that:

00:03:36.603 --> 00:03:40.021
I am My own Guru. I have to correct myself.

00:03:40.101 --> 00:03:46.454
I have to use this instrument of light to correct myself.

00:03:46.534 --> 00:03:50.574
The discipline has to come from ‘within’ yourself.

00:03:50.654 --> 00:03:55.822
Nobody has to tell you. And
when somebody tells, you feel hurt.

00:03:55.902 --> 00:04:01.583
So I don’t know how to tell
all this that it goes in the heart

00:04:01.663 --> 00:04:04.671
and doesn’t remain somewhere in the air.

00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:09.558
The discipline of within is like fragrance of flower.

00:04:09.638 --> 00:04:13.586
It gives you complete freedom, and
it gives complete freedom to others.
