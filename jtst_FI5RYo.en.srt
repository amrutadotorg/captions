1
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:45,410
Is very difficult to speak, even for Me

2
00:33:53,810 --> 00:34:00,890
to see so many Sahaja yogis

3
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:11,290
sitting here with such shining faces

4
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:14,810
from all over the world,

5
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:24,450
as if My vision has taken its form today.

6
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:40,170
I see in you the saviors of tomorrow

7
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:44,330
who are going to save this world

8
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:49,570
from all the Kali Yuga calamities

9
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,170
that are surrounding us.

10
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,890
Is coming from all sides,

11
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:06,290
while you people have really taken your second birth

12
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:10,770
from this pond of Kali Yuga

13
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:16,450
and have really become beautiful lotuses of different colors,

14
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:21,250
hues, fragrance and beauty.

15
00:35:21,890 --> 00:35:26,450
Instead of you celebrating My birthday,

16
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:31,490
is better I celebrate your birthdays.

17
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:39,290
As I told you the other day that

18
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:49,130
it is you who are such great seekers, seekers of truth, of love,

19
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,930
that it could work out,

20
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,570
otherwise it would have been impossible.

21
00:35:57,570 --> 00:36:02,050
To even transform one person is very difficult,

22
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:06,570
but you were so sensitive

23
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:11,930
and so deep that this subtle knowledge,

24
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:17,690
I don't know how it penetrated your being.

25
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,250
It's unbelievable.

26
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:24,130
I can't believe Myself

27
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:32,170
what great people have taken birth in this Kali Yuga.

28
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:36,290
No one can believe that there are so many

29
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,810
saints are sitting before Me, so many Walis;

30
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:42,530
so many Nalis are sitting before Me.

31
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:51,130
In the history of spirituality it has never happened.

32
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:56,090
Even in the heavens there are few devatas

33
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:59,410
and devas, not so many.

34
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,370
One better than the other

35
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:09,850
such beautiful heart,

36
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:15,850
such brilliant brains

37
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:28,690
and such active attention, is really

38
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:35,410
I thank you all that this seventieth birthday I could see

39
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:40,010
so many people, which I never expected.

40
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:44,850
You know, Sahaja Yoga was started with one person

41
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:49,010
and then those who came also,

42
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:54,850
out of them, some were power-oriented, money-oriented,

43
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:59,250
all kinds of people created problems for us.

44
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,810
One after another, so many problems came

45
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:06,130
and also there were many who were

46
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:10,690
of a very low-level seekers.

47
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:17,050
But I find today they have all come up beautifully.

48
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:22,970
I cannot distinguish one from another,

49
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:25,690
the way it has happened.

50
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,170
And the commitment you have to Sahaja Yoga

51
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:35,410
is the greatest blessings for this world.

52
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:41,050
I could not do it alone. You know that.

53
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:46,290
If I could do it, I would not have needed you.

54
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,250
You are the channels

55
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:55,810
and you have to work it out further and further.

56
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:03,250
It is really remarkable the way

57
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,570
Delhi people have organized everything.

58
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,210
First of all, everybody was very much

59
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:27,050
keyed onto the seventieth birthday.

60
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:32,370
I don't know what was the reason, but whatever it is,

61
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,730
and then Delhi people said,

62
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:35,730
"This time we are going to celebrate,

63
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:38,690
Mother, Your birthday in Delhi."

64
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:43,810
I said, "Everybody's ... on it, so be careful,

65
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:47,850
it's not going to be easy. It's a big headache.

66
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:52,170
So many will be coming down."

67
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,770
But they didn't expect so much, I'm sure

68
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:59,970
... people are coming. Hundred are coming from there,

69
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:04,170
hundred from there. I said, "Are you worried?"

70
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:07,490
They said, "No we are very happy about it."

71
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:12,010
I saw their enthusiasm, their organization,

72
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,690
the way they have done it.

73
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:16,610
The best part of it,

74
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:21,970
Delhi, which is a place where all kinds of politicians live,

75
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:25,170
have groups and politics and all that,

76
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:30,450
but in Sahaja Yoga in Delhi there is no politics.

77
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,290
There is no quarrelling.

78
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:46,210
There is no pulling each other's legs.

79
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,050
Is very remarkable thing

80
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:52,170
it to happen in a place like Delhi,

81
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:54,290
where every day what you hear

82
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:59,610
that even in our parliament they are beating each other.

83
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,450
Perhaps, in this hell only,

84
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:07,330
this goodness was to be born and

85
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:10,410
to be manifested by Sahaja yogis.

86
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:13,130
The knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

87
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:18,250
as you know, is extremely, extremely subtle

88
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,890
and it's not easy

89
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:30,410
to penetrate into the so-called

90
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:33,890
people who call themselves intellectuals

91
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:42,010
or who are absolutely bowed down to their conditionings.

92
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:47,090
So, on one side, we have the masses who are ignorant,

93
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:51,890
another side the classes who live in the frame

94
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:55,530
that they have made out of their brains.

95
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:01,530
Both ways, I think, they are extremely gross.

96
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:07,930
But the way they have absorbed

97
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:17,130
this subtle nectar of Divinity is something unbelievable.

98
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,890
Nobody can comprehend even

99
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:36,530
that there were so many born after My birth,

100
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:40,010
on this Earth,

101
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:44,970
or some maybe before also, very few.

102
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:48,770
Just after My birth they were born here

103
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:56,130
in this world, to get to Sahaja Yoga.

104
00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:01,530
But when I saw the world I was shocked,

105
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:04,090
more shocked than Kabira, himself.

106
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:08,890
I said, "How will I talk to anyone about it?"

107
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:11,050
My family members,

108
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:15,530
I didn't know how will I open the subject to them.

109
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:23,770
Was impossible, so much was darkness of ignorance.

110
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:31,370
How will they believe that there is really Divinity,

111
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:36,490
there is totality waiting for them?

112
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:40,610
They all believed into some sort of a religion,

113
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:43,930
which had no connection with reality.

114
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:50,850
And it was impossible even to envisage

115
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:54,970
the method by which I could talk to them.

116
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:58,090
I remember the first incident

117
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:05,490
when we went to Nargol, where I had opened the Sahasrara.

118
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:11,810
The first person who got realization was a Gujarati and a jeweler.

119
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:15,610
Immediately, all the other,

120
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:19,130
there were hardly about thirty-five people

121
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,690
they started saying that

122
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:23,490
"Of course, he's a rich man, he's a jeweler,

123
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:26,290
so Mother has given him realization."

124
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:30,330
I think that's the first time and last time I really got angry.

125
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:34,250
I started shouting at them,

126
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:36,250
"You are good for nothing, useless people,

127
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:39,130
you can never take to Divinity,"

128
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:41,890
and I had really thought that "Stop it now."

129
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,410
One has to take another life,

130
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:50,130
another time where people will understand what is Sahaja Yoga.

131
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:55,170
But after that, suddenly,

132
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:58,450
people started feeling the cool breeze in their hands,

133
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:03,330
immediately, after My shouting. Imagine.

134
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:09,850
And they said, "Mother, You know, it's working.

135
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:12,730
It's working in us. It's working out of us."

136
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:17,450
Thus, we got twelve people

137
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:24,610
and one lady whom I had given before also,

138
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,770
she was the fourteenth.

139
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:36,650
Thus, first we had only these fourteen Sahaja yogis,

140
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:43,530
for whom it was something out of the blue.

141
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:46,130
They were all flabbergasted.

142
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,890
They didn't know what it was.

143
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:56,330
And then, surprisingly, in one of our programs,

144
00:45:56,330 --> 00:46:04,850
a lady who was possessed by some Brahmin came

145
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:10,570
and started saying, "Jagadamba, Jagadamba."

146
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:15,010
They couldn't understand. I never told them what I was, never.

147
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:17,290
I've never told otherwise also.

148
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:22,610
So then, she recited a poem

149
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:25,490
from Saundarya Lahari in Sanskrit language

150
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,890
and she was just a maidservant.

151
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:31,130
And in a man's voice.

152
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,130
So everybody was shocked

153
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:38,890
that the bhoots should say all these things.

154
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:41,450
And then she went away.

155
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:46,730
After that, these people started probing into it.

156
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:51,890
And they wanted to have My Puja, first time,

157
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:55,050
in My house itself.

158
00:46:55,330 --> 00:47:03,570
Still people were not very sure they were doing the right thing.

159
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,450
Even the Brahmins they called, they said,

160
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:08,810
"This Saptasadi is a very difficult Puja

161
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:12,450
and something will happen to us."

162
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,050
But after the Puja they said,

163
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:18,130
"Nothing happened, we are so much better."

164
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:22,610
They all felt the cool breeze

165
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:26,410
and the entire atmosphere changed.

166
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:29,610
They started understanding that

167
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:35,290
Sahaja Yoga is the Yuga Dharma, is the one

168
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:43,490
of this yuga, this Kali Yuga,

169
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:51,370
so the Sahaj Dharma became the dharma of this yuga.

170
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:57,450
This yuga is very difficult, no doubt.

171
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:04,690
But in difficulties only we become intense seekers

172
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:10,610
and that's what happened with all of you,

173
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:17,450
that you found out that everywhere

174
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:20,730
people were following whatever they're following,

175
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:24,570
they were not reaching any point.

176
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,450
Like a cocoon,

177
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:31,290
they're hitting their head here and there.

178
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:34,570
They got their realizations

179
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:38,850
so quickly and when they told Me

180
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:44,170
how they were seeking, what was happening to them,

181
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:48,250
I was amazed.

182
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:53,610
How this seeking was working within them

183
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:56,570
and pushed them towards Sahaja Yoga.

184
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:58,770
Also, in the meanwhile, I must say,

185
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:07,410
so many got lost into the clutches of false gurus.

186
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:13,610
Despite that, today we have so many Sahaja yogis.

187
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:16,410
You are just representing your country,

188
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:20,330
but there are many more in your countries.

189
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:23,050
Even in India we have many more.

190
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:27,730
You are just here, come to represent them.

191
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:30,810
So, multiple of this number,

192
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:33,290
I do not know how many would be there.

193
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:35,810
So many asked "Me how many Sahaja yogis there are". I said,

194
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:37,690
"I don't know."

195
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:38,810
Say, "You don't know?"

196
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:43,570
I said, "No. We have never kept any record."

197
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:46,050
So they can't understand. I said,

198
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:53,210
"We have no office, no record. I have no secretary.

199
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:56,210
I don't know how to type.

200
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:59,930
I don't know how to write even My check."

201
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:02,890
They can't understand

202
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:07,010
person like Me existing in these modern times.

203
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:12,130
But everything gets done, somehow.

204
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:17,090
Despite all My modern ignorance,

205
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:21,570
everything gets absolutely

206
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:24,290
done in the most perfect manner

207
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:28,410
like a remote control.

208
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:31,490
Now this whole thing,

209
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:38,130
I never said a word about it, I must tell you, nothing.

210
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:43,930
Never I gave any idea as to how it should be.

211
00:50:43,930 --> 00:50:48,610
I didn't even tell them how many we are expecting.

212
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:54,770
But see how spontaneously everything has worked out

213
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:58,690
because you all have commitment

214
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:02,330
and that commitment gives you

215
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:06,730
all these organizing capacities.

216
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:15,810
So many things you have seen get organized

217
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:19,690
because also this Paramchaitanya

218
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:24,010
has come into Krita Yuga

219
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:28,250
where it is working it out. It's acting.

220
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:33,890
And this activity, also, is absolutely supportive to you.

221
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:38,770
For example, the police people told us

222
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:41,050
that there are Muslims living here

223
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:43,730
and you might have some danger from them.

224
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:46,210
They might do some harm to you.

225
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:48,370
I said, "Which Muslims are they?"

226
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:53,010
So they said, "Nizamuddin Aulia's people are here."

227
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:56,890
I said, "They'll never harm us."

228
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:01,010
I said, "Why? Because he was a Sufi

229
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:04,770
and he was a great realized soul

230
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:10,050
and the people who are along there, must be, most of them are,

231
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:14,450
at least, believers of Sufism.

232
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:17,610
How can they harm us?"

233
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,770
So I said, "Tomorrow, early in the morning,

234
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:26,170
you go and put a chador, as they call it, all of you,"

235
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:27,570
and they were so impressed

236
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:32,690
that you saw in the evening they came here all the way,

237
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:36,370
morning time, and they were so respectful.

238
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:38,530
Then they called Me, they gave Me another chador,

239
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:42,970
this, that and they said that we are Yours and this and that,

240
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:44,770
all kinds of things.

241
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:46,810
And his disciple was Amir Khusrau,

242
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:50,370
was another very, very great Sufi gentleman

243
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:54,090
and I always have admired his poetry

244
00:52:54,090 --> 00:53:00,530
and also the way Nizamuddin led his life of dignity

245
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:04,730
and divinity.

246
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:07,450
All these Muslims who were there put hands towards Me like this

247
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,530
and they said, "We are feeling the cool breeze,"

248
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:12,770
I said, "This is Ruh."

249
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,530
"Ah, this is Ruh."

250
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,530
Once these people start getting Ruh,

251
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,050
they will all become Sahaja yogis very soon

252
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:25,530
and you may have to have ...

253
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:40,690
There are so many Sufis all over the world

254
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:42,770
and we are going to take their addresses

255
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:44,210
and we are going to meet them;

256
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:46,930
then you might have to have another big pendal,

257
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:50,730
double pendal I think, maybe triple.

258
00:53:57,010 --> 00:54:04,890
If Delhi people are not quite frightened about the sizes,

259
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:09,330
I think again we'll have to have it in Delhi only.

260
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:28,490
Also contemporarily,

261
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:32,770
Delhi is in a state of turmoil

262
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:37,570
and we should be here to pacify it, to quieten it,

263
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:40,890
to give wisdom to those people

264
00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:44,690
who are supposed to be at the helm of affairs.

265
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:49,170
It will work. Definitely, it will work.

266
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:51,570
With all these Sahaja yogis

267
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:53,930
emitting such beautiful, vibrations.

268
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:55,410
See, on top of your head

269
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:59,050
this cloth is moving up and down all the time,

270
00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:02,010
though there is no breeze outside,

271
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:04,170
the leaves are just steady,

272
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:08,650
but from your head, you see, you are moving all this.

273
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:14,610
So I'm sure these vibrations

274
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:19,370
will cool down and will bring peace

275
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:24,130
to our politicians and to the people

276
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:28,530
who are at the helm of affairs.

277
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:32,810
At this juncture, when in the whole world

278
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:37,290
there are so many things going on

279
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,250
of uncertainties,

280
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:43,730
say in Russia, there are uncertainties,

281
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:46,890
Bosnia there is uncertainties,

282
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:49,890
in England there's recession,

283
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:52,050
America there is recession,

284
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:54,130
Spain there is recession,

285
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:56,930
everybody is suffering from the pangs

286
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:02,970
of some sort of a extreme behavior they went into.

287
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:06,050
So, I'm sure this polarity

288
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:09,250
that they see now will correct

289
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:13,450
their behavior towards materialism

290
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:19,130
and I'm sure that a balance will be struck.

291
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:23,050
With your good wishes, with your prayers,

292
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:30,130
this world will be so beautiful,

293
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:39,090
so enchanting that in the history,

294
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:41,410
people will describe

295
00:56:41,410 --> 00:56:45,050
that the world itself became a lotus

296
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:50,410
full of fragrance of Divinity.

297
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:01,170
You are the petals,

298
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:04,890
you are the corona,

299
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:09,890
you are the color,

300
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:13,450
you are the beauty,

301
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:16,930
you are the pollen

302
00:57:17,690 --> 00:57:21,610
of that beautiful lotus

303
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:28,330
which is My vision of this world.

304
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:31,170
I hope today

305
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:37,690
you all will decide to work for Sahaja Yoga,

306
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,130
to spread Sahaja Yoga

307
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:42,930
and work for yourself also.

308
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:45,090
The only danger is

309
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:50,130
that one should not allow ego to sit on your heads.

310
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:55,170
That's the only horse.

311
00:57:55,170 --> 00:57:59,970
If you could ride yourself and don't allow the horse to ride you,

312
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:02,250
you'll progress very fast,

313
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:05,450
beautifully.

314
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:16,490
Thus, I'm sure Sahaja Yoga will spread.

315
00:58:16,490 --> 00:58:25,050
Every birthday we have to take a vow.

316
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:30,490
I don't know what vow I should take.

317
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,290
People have told Me that I should not work so hard,

318
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:38,170
I'm working very hard,

319
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:42,530
but I have taken a vow that I'll work double hard.

320
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:52,530
In the same way, you also,

321
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:55,410
all of you, have to take a vow today

322
00:58:55,410 --> 00:59:00,250
that we'll go all out in the commitment

323
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:03,490
of working of Sahaja Yoga.

324
00:59:03,490 --> 00:59:06,370
We'll think about it.

325
00:59:06,370 --> 00:59:09,210
There are scientists who should produce books,

326
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:11,890
there are doctors who should produce books,

327
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:13,370
writings,

328
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:14,690
go round,

329
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:16,610
talk to their colleagues,

330
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:20,570
organize meetings,

331
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:24,090
seminars with your colleagues.

332
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:29,370
There are architects

333
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:34,890
and other professionals

334
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:40,810
who could call their colleagues and give them realization.

335
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,530
Even the people who are dealing with finances

336
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:46,050
should take to Sahaja Yoga.

337
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:49,650
Is very important because

338
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:53,890
financial problems can only be

339
00:59:54,050 --> 00:59:56,770
solved by the Divine Power.

340
00:59:56,770 --> 01:00:00,330
Nobody else can solve it.

341
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:04,490
So everyone in this world,

342
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:09,930
whether it is law or any other field,

343
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:15,170
all of you should take to Sahaja Yoga

344
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:20,690
and also to creative work.

345
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:26,010
Then also, you have to take Sahaja Yoga

346
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:28,490
to your surroundings,

347
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:35,010
to villages, to cities,

348
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:38,050
wherever it is possible,

349
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:40,450
wherever you can organize,

350
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:44,330
you have to spread Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

351
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:47,050
As far as curing is concerned,

352
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:50,410
I would advise, you don't have to touch anyone.

353
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:53,210
Please use only My photograph.

354
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:56,050
That's how you'll get more Sahaja yogis

355
01:00:56,050 --> 01:01:00,490
and less sick people.

356
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,010
Also, people will be cured

357
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:06,770
and all of them will become Sahaja yogis.

358
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:10,370
We have also agricultural field

359
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:12,810
on which we have done something,

360
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:18,210
but much can be done about agriculture.

361
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:20,890
One should see the government and tell them

362
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:23,290
what agriculture can do.

363
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:26,370
You can form a committee and go and see them

364
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:30,490
and talk to them that

365
01:01:30,490 --> 01:01:36,410
how agriculture can be helped by Sahaja Yoga.

366
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:39,050
We have to help our children.

367
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:41,410
We have to look after them

368
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:50,610
because you know what sort of future is surrounding them,

369
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:53,810
what sort of atmosphere is crawling,

370
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:57,250
even in India.

371
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:01,050
So we have to see that our children

372
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:04,290
properly grow in Sahaj culture.

373
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:07,570
Is very important

374
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:11,410
because they are tomorrow's Sahaja yogis.

375
01:02:11,410 --> 01:02:14,250
So many of them are born realized,

376
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,930
so we have to discipline them properly

377
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:22,570
and we have to make them aala, "aala darza"

378
01:02:22,570 --> 01:02:27,130
Sahaja yogi, as described in the qawali.

379
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:38,570
It is also our family life which is very important.

380
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:40,610
Is shocking that

381
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:44,170
family life is nowadays becoming

382
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:48,090
a kind of a stupid thing.

383
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:51,290
No one understands the importance of it.

384
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:54,850
In Sahaja Yoga we have to understand.

385
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:59,570
Small quarrels, fights, should be given up.

386
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:04,930
Harshness must be given up, cruelty must be given up

387
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:10,810
and there should be a proper rapport

388
01:03:10,810 --> 01:03:18,370
between husband and wife to begin with,

389
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:22,010
so that there is a companionship

390
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:25,330
and the children also see that companionship

391
01:03:25,330 --> 01:03:29,250
and enjoy it.

392
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:33,850
In our dress, in our life,

393
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:38,730
we have to be dignified and decent, respecting our body.

394
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:41,210
Is very important.

395
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:43,690
We should wear whatever suits us

396
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:46,450
in whatever country we are.

397
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:49,490
I mean, imagine in summer climate

398
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:52,250
if somebody wants to wear a three-piece suit,

399
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:54,690
what will happen to him?

400
01:03:55,370 --> 01:03:56,970
Whatever suits us,

401
01:03:56,970 --> 01:04:01,290
whatever fits our culture,

402
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:05,850
one should try to wear decent dresses,

403
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:08,570
traditional dresses.

404
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:11,370
Specially for women, it is very important

405
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:16,210
to wear dresses that will make them look more dignified.

406
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:26,490
Also, another point I would like to say,

407
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:31,370
that ladies, specially, must take to reading,

408
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:34,890
at least newspapers.

409
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:39,050
If your attention is on the problems

410
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:42,650
that are in this world, it's very effective

411
01:04:42,650 --> 01:04:47,490
because you know your attention is active, it works.

412
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:51,810
So use your attention.

413
01:04:51,810 --> 01:04:53,290
You see the newspapers,

414
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,930
you watch -- I know it's horrifying sometimes

415
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:57,730
you can give a bandhan,

416
01:04:57,730 --> 01:05:01,090
but you must see what's happening where,

417
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:03,890
is very important.

418
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:08,810
Also men should not just read something sensational,

419
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:11,970
but read something that's happening

420
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:15,370
and also think, what are the solutions.

421
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:18,770
How can you people, as Sahaja yogis, help it,

422
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:22,050
in a collective way or in an individual way.

423
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:29,850
We have to solve many problems of this modern world.

424
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:32,930
Also one has to read good books,

425
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:35,970
good films one has to see,

426
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:38,690
and have your reflection on them.

427
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:40,650
Keep your mind alert.

428
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:44,890
There are many beautiful poems I've read recently

429
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:46,370
coming out of

430
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:49,290
some people where I never expected they will write poems,

431
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:51,850
beautiful, very high class.

432
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:55,330
So this poetry also, we are going to collect.

433
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:58,450
We are going to collect all the miraculous photographs

434
01:05:58,450 --> 01:05:59,970
from everywhere.

435
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:03,370
They are trying to systematize now.

436
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:05,330
And now, in this system,

437
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:07,970
if you can all help spontaneously,

438
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:12,410
it will be a great achievement

439
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:15,930
because, so far, we have not been able to collect

440
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:20,130
all these datas and keep them with us.

441
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:25,170
Now the best is that you all must meditate.

442
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:27,890
All have to meditate.

443
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:30,650
Only in meditation you are in present

444
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:33,450
and you grow in your spirituality.

445
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:37,450
I've said it many a times, but people just don't do it.

446
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:41,010
About ten minutes, if you can meditate

447
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:44,610
before sleeping, it's of a very great help to you,

448
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:47,490
no doubt.

449
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:49,570
We really grow very fast.

450
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:52,370
Immediately I know this man is meditating,

451
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:54,530
the way he has changed.

452
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:56,330
And then, once you get used to it,

453
01:06:56,570 --> 01:06:59,050
you'll never give it up.

454
01:06:59,050 --> 01:07:01,010
Is very simple meditation.

455
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:03,770
You have foot soaking or something like that

456
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,890
and in the morning you should beat your ego,

457
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,570
that's all.

458
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:11,610
Is not that you have to do

459
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:15,050
one lakh jappas or something.

460
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:16,530
Nothing of the kind.

461
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:18,250
Is very simple.

462
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:20,450
But this, you have to do for yourself,

463
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:26,770
to respect your Self-realization and your growth in divinity.

464
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:36,010
We have lots of advantages over others.

465
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,290
But one thing I have to tell you,

466
01:07:38,290 --> 01:07:43,490
those people who are not prone to seeking,

467
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:47,050
please don't talk to them about Sahaja Yoga.

468
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:50,050
Don't waste your energy on such people,

469
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:52,050
discussing and arguing,

470
01:07:52,050 --> 01:07:54,810
because it cannot be discussed much.

471
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:57,490
You just forget them and leave them alone.

472
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,090
I'll look after them.

473
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:02,890
You just take to simple people, good people,

474
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:06,970
who are seeking the truth.

475
01:08:06,970 --> 01:08:09,530
I don't want you to break your necks with those people

476
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:13,290
who are just believing in discussion,

477
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:16,650
arguments and shabda jaal.

478
01:08:16,650 --> 01:08:20,970
Today the Sahaja Yoga culture is so much manifesting

479
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:24,090
that people, once they see you, they immediately know

480
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:26,610
there's something special

481
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:31,650
and that they have something very unique

482
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:37,450
qualities among them which you seldom find with normal people.

483
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:40,010
All these things, you should understand,

484
01:08:40,010 --> 01:08:43,130
have come to you spontaneously from within,

485
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:46,690
but you must preserve them and you should never feel shy of them.

486
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:50,170
Should never be shy of your virtues.

487
01:08:51,490 --> 01:08:53,330
And whatever people may try

488
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:55,730
to tell you that "You better do this and better do that"

489
01:08:55,730 --> 01:08:57,690
if it is wrong you should never do it.

490
01:08:56,370 --> 01:09:02,530
Because, now, you are very powerful

491
01:08:57,690 --> 01:09:00,290
Should just say, "I don't want to do it."

492
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:09,730
and that you have to lead the people

493
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:11,410
and people don't have to lead you.

494
01:09:11,410 --> 01:09:13,370
Fashions don't have to lead you,

495
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:15,850
but you have to create fashions.

496
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:19,570
You have to create a path for them.

497
01:09:19,570 --> 01:09:22,450
It's not that you have to

498
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:26,410
trod on the path that they have made.

499
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:27,850
Try to understand

500
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:31,210
that your own personality

501
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:36,410
is of a level where you can see so many subtle things

502
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:40,050
and you are so powerful, that others don't see,

503
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:45,290
then you have to automatically take up their leadership.

504
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:47,370
Don't get ideas from them

505
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:49,010
and don't get frightened

506
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:51,490
when they try to tell you something

507
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:54,410
against yourself or against Sahaja Yoga.

508
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:59,530
Be sure. Be confident. That is how it is going to work out.

509
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:02,450
Now, I'm just a woman and a housewife,

510
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:05,850
but I was so sure about Sahaja Yoga

511
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:08,850
that it worked out.

512
01:10:10,730 --> 01:10:12,210
I didn't have to,

513
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:16,410
sort of, think whether I should do it or not.

514
01:10:16,410 --> 01:10:21,050
I just started it.

515
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:24,210
Though in the family it was not so much respected,

516
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:28,130
not so much agreed to, doesn't matter.

517
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:31,170
I started the whole thing on My own,

518
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:33,010
worked it out on My own,

519
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:36,330
because I had complete confidence in the truth,

520
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:39,650
that if I am standing on the truth it will help Me

521
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:42,730
and it will help all those who will come to Me.

522
01:10:42,730 --> 01:10:44,810
It has happened.

523
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:47,770
So for you, it should not be difficult at all.

524
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:49,570
All of you should, first of all,

525
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:51,890
see that you are not a conditioned person

526
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:54,170
and you do not have an ego

527
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:57,050
and then you should go ahead with it

528
01:10:57,050 --> 01:11:00,410
and you'll be amazed how things will work out.

529
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:04,170
Today's puja is very short puja.

530
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:08,650
That's why I gave you a long lecture.

531
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:12,290
There are so many things which I cannot,

532
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:18,050
at this time, which is short, tell you

533
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:21,010
but if you sit down, you can easily make

534
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:25,130
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight yourself.

535
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:28,490
So, now put your mind to it

536
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:33,010
in a way that you are the organizer.

537
01:11:33,010 --> 01:11:35,770
Then what should you do? What can you do?

538
01:11:35,770 --> 01:11:37,050
What are you going to achieve?

539
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:41,690
Please try and it will work out.

540
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:44,170
All of you can do it.

541
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:47,210
I think best is to make a diary for yourself

542
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:50,250
and write it down in that: what you have done,

543
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:52,330
how many people you have given realization,

544
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:56,970
how many got cured, what do you think about them.

545
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:59,530
But now, if there's no diary,

546
01:11:59,530 --> 01:12:00,850
Sahaja yogis can say among,

547
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:03,930
"Mother, we have no diary, so we'll start it tomorrow." No,

548
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:06,970
you start it today.

549
01:12:08,690 --> 01:12:11,330
Only trouble with Sahaja yogis

550
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:15,250
is that they take things little lightly.

551
01:12:18,290 --> 01:12:22,650
Of course, that is their character.

552
01:12:22,650 --> 01:12:26,210
But not Sahaja Yoga.

553
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:28,490
Other things you can take lightly.

554
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:30,250
If somebody shouts at you,

555
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:31,730
somebody gets angry with you,

556
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:34,290
somebody even slaps you, take it lightly.

557
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:37,250
Doesn't matter, makes no difference to you,

558
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:39,210
because you are the spirit.

559
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:40,810
Nothing can destroy the spirit.

560
01:12:40,810 --> 01:12:43,690
Nainam Chidanti Shastrani.

561
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:48,050
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga,

562
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:50,330
your attitude should be different.

563
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:52,530
If you are relaxing on one side,

564
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:55,890
another side you have to be dynamic

565
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:58,770
and that side is where you have to put forward

566
01:12:58,770 --> 01:13:00,330
the theories of Sahaja Yoga,

567
01:13:00,330 --> 01:13:02,090
when you have to talk to people,

568
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:04,370
you have to organize a press conference

569
01:13:04,370 --> 01:13:06,490
or whatever sort of thing you want to do.

570
01:13:06,490 --> 01:13:08,490
At whatever level you want to work it out,

571
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:10,930
please make a proper plan about it

572
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:13,050
and just do it.

573
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:17,410
It will all work out. I'm sure it will work out.

574
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:23,090
With all these ideas that I have,

575
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:27,210
you have many more

576
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:31,170
and I hope by next year,

577
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:33,890
we'll see manifestation of those.

578
01:13:33,890 --> 01:13:36,050
I hope many people will write books

579
01:13:36,050 --> 01:13:38,370
like U.C. Rai has written.

580
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:44,290
I'm sure books can be written by every doctor.

581
01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:47,130
Doctor U.C. Rai has worked single-handed.

582
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:49,850
Everything he has done single-handed.

583
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:52,570
So beautifully he has worked it out.

584
01:13:52,570 --> 01:13:58,050
So, everybody can publish a book with their experiences,

585
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:01,330
with their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

586
01:14:01,130 --> 01:14:04,290
which will help Sahaja yogis also.

587
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:09,410
But it should be honest, very honest book.

588
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:12,810
I'm sure such a book will be very much appreciated

589
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:17,410
in Sahaja Yoga and we would like to publish such books also.

590
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:19,610
All those who have such ideas

591
01:14:19,610 --> 01:14:25,210
should make an effort to create some new books,

592
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:30,450
some new ideas, some new creation.

593
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:32,490
Is very important

594
01:14:32,490 --> 01:14:34,530
because in these modern times

595
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:37,810
people want to do something new,

596
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:40,730
something novel.

597
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:43,530
Under these circumstances,

598
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:46,330
I'm sure you all will work out.

599
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:50,410
So, all the time we have to think about Sahaja Yoga

600
01:14:50,410 --> 01:14:55,530
and jot it down whatever ideas are coming into your mind

601
01:14:55,530 --> 01:14:59,370
and then these can be properly put together,

602
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:03,330
making a beautiful book of Sahaja Yoga.

603
01:15:03,330 --> 01:15:06,330
Ladies also have lots of chances of doing

604
01:15:06,330 --> 01:15:09,610
so many things for Sahaja Yoga.

605
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:17,250
This is a very opportune time.

606
01:15:17,610 --> 01:15:26,330
I think Satya Yuga is starting from tomorrow. No doubt.

607
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:47,370
And what will be the symptom

608
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:53,290
that now the satya will be victorious, vijaya.

609
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,330
Whatever people may try,

610
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:07,250
ultimately satya will be vijaya.

611
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:08,730
Satyame vijayate.

612
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:13,650
That's going to happen and you are responsible.

613
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:21,490
For this I congratulate you again and again.

614
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:25,170
And I hope you will have the commitment to do that.

615
01:16:25,170 --> 01:16:28,730
May God bless you all.
