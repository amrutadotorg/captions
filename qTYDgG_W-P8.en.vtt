of course I've told you about the brown

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.460
now you have become the chicken

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.380
making so many eggs everyday

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.520
you study something like our birthday we

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:44.629
said when we became a bird out of the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.610
cheese Michelle

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:52.769
so Easter is our birthday we are selling

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:58.739
out of our realization and every day we

00:00:52.769 --> 00:01:02.100
must grow with our birthday why in a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.259

birthday comes in

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:11.280

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:14.369
you're proud that you are growing and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.200
the human level you feel unhappy that

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.869
you are going here you feel proud that

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.660
you are going just the opposite of what

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:30.420
you are doing if you try to do it it

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:32.910
will be nice I mean that doesn't mean

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.720
bugging indiscreet you know I am quite

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:41.119
worried on that point discretion is the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.119
first thing that you should have before
