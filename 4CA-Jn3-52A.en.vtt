00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:12.480
It is such a pleasure today –
and great fortune

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:20.680
that here, where William Blake lived,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.520
and He sang those songs
of the greatness of this country,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:35.360
the future that it has to be,
the dreams He saw,

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:43.440
have now come to shape,
that we are here

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:52.000
to celebrate His anniversary.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.720
Things go beyond words
and you cannot express yourself.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.640
Many people do not understand Him

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.480
because He wrote it, according to them,
in abstract language

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.560
or in the language
that He understood.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.600
But I am happy
that Sahaja Yogis understand Him so well,

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:27.480
and the prophesies that He made
about England.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.480
People used to ridicule,
ridicule it.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:46.040
Even today they can't believe
that Jerusalem can be built in England.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:54.480
They cannot believe
that people who have been all their lives,

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.440
for ages together,
thought of nothing but materialism,

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.480
can take to spirituality to this extent
that it becomes Jerusalem,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.520
and that the whole world comes
to pay homage to this Holy Land,

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.440
that this becomes the Holy Land.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:22.680
It's a fact, He dreamt, He wished it,
because He knew the value of this land.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.560
This land has been touched
by Christ's feet.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.320
Since long, people knew
about Kundalini.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.680
Even if that is lost,
for history it remains,

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.960
and He knew about it,
He spoke about it.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.760
In His lifetime, maybe,
people never understood him.

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.280
They must have thought
that He's really a madman,

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.160
or something, a fantasy,
or some sort of a poet

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.960
who doesn't understand.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.760
But what He wrote,
every word of it, is the truth.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.397
Such a great soul should live
in Hampstead, itself,

00:06:10.397 --> 00:06:14.560
is such a blessing, great blessing.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.920
Such people, even if they write or not,
they leave their mark,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.440
their ascent becomes the milestone
for the people who live there:

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.800
the aspirations become different,
their priorities become different.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.160
The change is so subtle;
is to be seen, to be felt,

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.800
to be understood.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.920
And very sensitive people only
can be born in such places.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:44.680
Of course, there could be very bad people
also, to counteract it.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:51.920
But the sensitivity of the atmosphere
attracts such souls to that place

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.880
who are sensitive.

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:04.440
You can see from His poems
that He was absolutely authoritative.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.600
He knew the authority.
He had the authority.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.440
He talked like a man
with complete authority.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.440
He had no doubt here, has no doubts.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.760
He just said,
"This is going to happen".

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:22.360
And, like a great warrior –
He knew that one has to fight

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:29.880
the negativity,
one has to fight all dark problems.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:36.000
The Spirit has to fight all the time
the matter.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.120
And that's how He talked, spoke, wrote
as a warrior would do,

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:54.640
because He started the fight
when He was born, hundred years back.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:08:06.000
And to Me, He's very great,
because He said all these things;

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.160
He prepared the stage for Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:18.040
Because He wrote all these things,
we can say that this was all said.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:21.800
Because human beings are such,
unless and until it is said before,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.240
they are not going to listen to it.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.400
They'll ask you,
"What is the reference

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.560
for what you are saying?"

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.900
You have to give reference
for everything, you see –

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.620
whatever is written,
according to them, is scripture,

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:33.760
it is the last word.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.800
Whether the book is published
in any trash list, doesn't matter,

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.000
but it's published already.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.120
It's such a great thing He's done,

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.120
but He's not done it
for any material gain,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:54.520
or for any fame,
or anything that is superfluous,

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.200
but He's done it for something
that is very eternal.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:06.320
And that is the awakening
of human beings.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:14.400
That is their second birth,
that is the knowledge of the Spirit.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:18.040
These words cannot come
from a man who's a weakling,

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.160
who is a doubting fellow,
who doesn't know where he stands,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.880
who's confused, who is a drunkard
or who is an alcoholic,

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.360
sort of a gone case
or a madcap, cannot!

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.640
And it cannot come
from an egoistical man

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.360
who thinks no end of himself,
a man who dominates others,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.240
who believes in robbing
other countries,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.080
going to other countries
and rob them,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.200
and go to another house
and rob them,

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.520
not from such people.

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:53.360
It comes from a person who knows
the value, the soil on which he's born,

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:59.320
the spiritual value of that land,
not the material value.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.840
And it's so subtle, so subtle;
every word is so subtle,

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:13.280
that it's like a chant,
it's like a chant.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.400
You are specially blessed because
such a great poet was born

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.120
in this country.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:25.760
And, wherever I go,
in My series of lectures,

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.320
at least in one lecture
I always mention Him.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.720
He has gone into great detail,
just like Markandeya,

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:49.320
another great poet in India,
who was born thousands of years back.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:53.560
But to realize that this country
is the heart of the universe,

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:57.160
and here the Jerusalem is going to be,

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.960
nobody could have thought
hundred years back a thing like that.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.520
It's fantastic actually.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.760
Even thirty years back,
nobody could have understood it,

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.640
even, I would say, ten years back.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.240
People would have thought
this man is really mad,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.640
to call this as the Holy Land.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.840
It is today the Holy Land,
you can see that.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.680
Because so many people
have got Realization in this country.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.280
And you are the ones
who circulate everything.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.640
It is the heart.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:31.400
Whatever the English do,
whether right or wrong, it all circulates,

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.080
though they don't understand
their responsibility,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.560
because they don't know
it is the heart, heart of the universe!

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.120
If you do wrong, all right:
the whole world does that same.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.520
People think, that among all
the Western countries,

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.360
you are the wisest,
that's what they think.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.000
I don't know how far you come to!

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.800
They believe, "It's English, you see".
Even Arabs.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.480
If you say, "It is English",
they believe you.

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.000
How far it is true,
God only knows.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:13.640
And the values that He cherished,
the dreams that He saw,

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.280
and the aspirations He had
were so great,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:23.120
that one has to know that there must be
something in this land that He aspired,

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.200
He was not mad, in any way.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:34.200
Nowhere, no poet in any country
has written like this.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:39.600
It was given Him the chance,
the authority to say it.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.320
That means you must circulate.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.960
Circulate with the heart,
that circulates, scatters,

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.120
looks after the whole body.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.840
And, once it collapses,
the whole body collapses.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.960
It's not so.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:59.120
The English heart has to become
the heart of William Blake,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:06.440
and not the chicken-hearted one,
or the aggressive one,

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:13.360
or the hatred-filled pockets,
or the hateful one.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.360
Because the blood flows through you.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.360
To realize this,
to understand the responsibility

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:27.880
of an Englishman is very, very great.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.320
In the heart resides the Spirit.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:39.760
Sahaja Yogis know this, that,
till a certain stage,

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:46.000
it resides in the heart.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:54.520
So, it's a very, very great position
you occupy,

00:13:54.520 --> 00:14:02.760
so that you people become aware.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:14.320
It's important also that you are the cells,
the important cells of the heart.

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:24.240
Heart doesn't think, does it?
It does not think, it loves.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:29.200
It loves.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.080
When you think, you must know
you are not Englishmen

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:43.160
as described by William Blake.
But if you love, you are.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:50.880
And love doesn't mean personal love,
or carnal love,

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:57.120
or all kinds of ideas of love
is charity work.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.920
It means the love of the Spirit
which is awakened within you

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.320
which just emits love,
which just emits.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.080
It doesn't think, it just emits;

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:12.320
it doesn't think that whether it should
give to the black or the white;

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.080
whether it should give it
to the rich or the poor.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:23.280
It just loves. It flows.

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:30.960
And that is why one should get
Realization in England.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.720
Very important.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:37.800
Without Realization,
you cannot flow, you cannot give,

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.680
you will never understand
the value of giving,

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.760
you will never enjoy giving.

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.040
You will never know
the beauty of generosity

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.400
unless and until you become
the cell of the heart.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.800
You are the cell of the heart.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.240
It's the most important position,
as I told you,

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:08.080
it's the most vital particle
of that heart.

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:14.800
And the one who is the heart
has to be like a lion.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.680
He roared, actually roars,
if you read these things,

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:26.720
like a lion He roars.
He has to be like a lion.

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.520
And not to be frightened,
like English language is, 'I'm afraid'.

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.280
It starts with 'I'm afraid',
and ends with 'I'm afraid'.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.200
What are you afraid of?
Every person is afraid of you.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:48.120
What are you afraid of?
You have to change your language.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:53.160
You have to speak like Him,
Sahaja Yogis have to speak

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.120
like William Blake.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.160
The way He spoke
about His great country,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.760
about the soil in which He was born,

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.760
about the people
who will be born here,

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.000
who will be Sahaja Yogis,
He has described them so well:

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.120
that men of God will be born
on this soil –

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:21.920
men of God, special people,
the chosen ones,

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:25.880
not those who have branded themselves
as "chosen".

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.840
Most of the "chosen" ones
are going towards the Hell only.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:37.520
But the really chosen ones
will be born on this soil.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.760
And they will become prophets.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:46.280
Not only that, but they'll have
a special power to make others prophets.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.480
He saw it.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:54.800
At that time, He could see
that you all are going to become prophets,

00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:00.840
and that you all are going to make
others prophets.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.920
Like one enlightened light
enlightens another.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.520
He could see so clearly.

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.120
What a clear heart He must be having!

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:14.360
What a clear vision He must be having,
what a clear brain He must be having

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:19.080
to receive all this information
about today!

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:26.280
So you have to become, it's the point,
you may be God's people,

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.240
but you have to become a prophet.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.880
Unless and until you are a prophet,
what's the use of choosing you also,

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.200
what's the use of you being born here?

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.840
You all have to become prophets.

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:44.280
And, to become a prophet,
Kundalini has to be awakened,

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.520
you have to be Realized,

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.120
and you get these special powers
to realize others.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.840
People can't believe it that,
in Sahaja Yoga today,

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.840
if you get Realization,
you can give Realization to others.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:02.760
When I went to Rome the people
had these doubts, I felt,

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.880
when I said that,
"Next moment you can give

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:06.600
Realization to others".

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.320
And they just could not believe it,
that they can feel the Kundalini,

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.320
they can give Realization.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.040
It's too much to believe in it,
it's too fantastic.

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.920
So, the last day, I said,

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.280
"All those who have felt the cool breeze
can stand behind the people

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.680
who have not felt the cool breeze".

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.400
They are very nice people,
I must say, these people in Rome,

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.120
because I think they have reached
the conclusion of complete frustration

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.960
with their seeking.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.440
So they stood up
behind each of one of them.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.520
And they were amazed
they could raise the Kundalini;

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.480
they could give Realization.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.960
They said, "Mother,
we got Realization only yesterday",

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.920
some of them.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.480
I said, "It's all right;
you could have done it yesterday,

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.480
but today you are doing it
with rather".

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.360
"You could have done it immediately.
But this is what it is,

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.320
a fantastic thing".

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.640
So there is no place for you
to have any doubts;

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.000
don't waste your energy in doubting.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.520
You have done that, it's too much.
It's too much.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:08.680
Now the time has come for you
to get your realization,

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.760
to get enlightened,
to understand it.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.320
But there are still people
who are on the fence,

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.600
and they are neither this way
nor that way.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.400
And Christ has described them very well.

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.840
He said, "I don't mind hot or cold",

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.320
meaning the people who get
the cool breeze,

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:30.040
of course they are first class.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.680
Even those who get hot are all right,
because they would like

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.680
to get rid of their hot.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:41.200
"But the half-way I don't like.
I'll spit them out of My mouth".

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.400
The ones who go three steps forward
and four steps backwards;

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.240
such people are really a headache
to Sahaja Yoga, I tell you.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.800
If they get out, it's much better.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.640
Half-hearted people in Sahaja Yoga
are of no use,

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.360
which was told by Christ,
long time back,

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:02.840
but I don't know if people
really realize it or not.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:07.320
And this is the problem I have faced
in this country a bit too much.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.640
The maximum in this country,
to be very frank.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:16.240
The ego is of a subtle nature,
such a subtle nature, in this country.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.600
Every country has a different type.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:25.080
Like we can say in Spain,
it is like the bullfighting.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.791
In Rome it is the artist's ego;
they think they are great artists,

00:21:30.791 --> 00:21:33.520
you see, they have a sense of beauty.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:34.520
All sorts of things.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:37.760
But, in this country,
you must know what sort of an ego

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:43.400
you people have,
it's thinking that,

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:48.600
'Nobody could be better than us.
We are the topmost people.'

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.800
You see, that upper –
what do you call it –

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.343
upper lip? Upper stiff?

00:21:54.343 --> 00:21:56.800
Stiff upper lip, stiff upper lip.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:05.560
I mean, they themselves laugh
at themselves – it's a good idea.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.520
But it's true; I have seen that.

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.200
That stiff upper lip is the point;

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.560
that doesn't make you to smile, laugh –

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:18.360
I mean, even if you certify
that you can smile now, they would not.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:22.840
That sort of a thing,
this makes you very insensitive.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:28.520
As if the ego comes down from there
and settles down on the lip.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.640
You cannot, there's no mobility
on the lips, nothing.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.240
"What?"

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:44.400
Such a terrifying face sometimes,
that you don't want to find that.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:51.640
It takes nothing to smile,
to be congenial.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.720
We are all human beings.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:57.280
We are not dogs,
that we should bark at each other,

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.200
that we should be frowning,
that we should frown at each other.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:05.720
First thing we have to learn,
that we are the heart cells,

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.360
and that we have to love.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:13.240
Without love, you cannot be called
an Englishman,

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.880
according to Mr William Blake.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.680
I won't say anything,
because I don't want to be hanged.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.160
According to Him.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:28.440
So, first of all, let us know
if we can really love ourselves.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.280
That's the biggest problem.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.200
The first disease,
He did not know perhaps,

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.320
William Blake did not know
what I will have to face.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.480
I wish He had written all that.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:45.800
The first disease the people have here,
apart from the upper lip,

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:51.160
is Left Vishuddhi – means guilt.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.240
They may be Catholic or not,
does not matter.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:58.440
But they have this built-in guilt
within themselves for nothing at all.

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.440
First of all,
you must give up your guilt business.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.920
I think He did not know about it.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.520
William Blake did not know
that people will develop this,

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:12.880
because at that time,
they were not like that.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.520
And this is such a big problem,
which I have been facing,

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:21.520
since I came to this country.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:27.520
You know, the first four years,
I was struggling with people

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:28.520
who were druggists and chemists.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:35.240
And the problem they had that,
I said, "Why did you take drugs?"

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.680
"What is there to live
in this world for?

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.800
For what are we living?"

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.760
I said, "For your Spirit".

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.160
So they take spirits, you see.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:49.680
English language has a great advantage,
you see.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.680
You can say it is the Spirit,
in the heart.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.080
You can say the spirit you drink.

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:59.000
Or the spirit –
that is what we call a bhoot

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.360
in the Indian language,
means a dead body, dead soul,

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:04.520
a dead person.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.280
So this is the advantage,
and that's how they were indulging

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.360
into spirits.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.840
But the problem with them is,
it was such a vicious circle that,

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:21.080
if you tried to correct them,
they would come, recede into themselves,

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:24.960
and get into tantrums.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.440
And say that,
"We are good-for-nothing,

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.320
useless people".

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.580
All right. Then I would encourage them,
say, "No, no, you are wonderful people,

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.920
it doesn't matter. You don't worry".

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:43.400
This, that, every sort of a pamper.
Then they would become ego oriented.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:47.520
It was impossible.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:58.240
And the story of people who are always
described in a mathematics' paper,

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.680
you see, when they give you –
let's say, seventh standard,

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:07.960
sixth standard –
you get a question like this:

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:13.760
"A house was to be built.
And in that village,

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:18.360
one Mr A came to work,
he did only 1/16 of the work

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.160
and he ran away.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:25.200
And another came in,
who did only 1/50 of the work,

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.000
and ran away.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.080
And then the third one came,
who did only the 1/100 of the work

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.520
and disappeared.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:36.440
So when will the work be finished?"

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.960
"Never" is the answer.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:45.040
If you have all runaways
and those who are escapists,

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.640
how can the work be finished
with these people who always escape?

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.840
Simple answer is 'never'.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.860
You may calculate it,
go on calculating it,

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:55.360
your answer is 'never'.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:56.800
It's the one.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.840
If you want to escape the situation,
if you want to escape yourself,

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:05.600
if you want to escape the present,
you will never reach there,

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.320
where you have to reach.

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:10.120
And you are never going to be satisfied
with yourself;

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.640
you are not going to be happy, either.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:18.560
So you have to face it;
you have to face it, as it is, and stand up.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.880
That's what He said, that,
"You bring the arrow to Me,

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.200
I'll face it".

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.240
Like a brave man you have to face it,

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:32.960
and not to become, "I'm afraid".

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.680
You are not to escape yourself.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:43.240
You are so beautiful.
Inside, outside, you are very beautiful.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:45.040
You are the Spirit.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.440
And, if you are the Spirit,
why should you escape yourself?

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.880
I just can't understand.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.480
Just face it,
and the Spirit will shine through you.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:57.520
Just face it with that bravery.

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:02.200
Face it, and you will be amazed
that you are really beautiful.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.000
No doubt about it.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.480
You have to just see,
because you are the cell of the heart.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:17.840
But it won't be an exaggeration if I say,
that the body, everything,

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.720
depends on the heart.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.720
If you fail,
the responsibility will be yours.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:28.120
It's a very big responsibility,
and a very sweet one.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:35.560
Because heart doesn't think.
Thinking is madness.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:41.120
It loves.
It loves and enjoys its love.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.720
It's such a sweet work you have to do.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.960
For that, you start from yourself,
first of all, love yourself,

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.920
which is a very difficult thing
for people, to love themselves.

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.160
The hatred starts from within.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:57.760
You hate yourself
and then you start hating everyone.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.200
And it's very common to say,
"I hate you",

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.720
second moment, "I love you".

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.300
God knows what they mean.

00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:06.960
But the main thing is
that they do not love themselves.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:11.240
If they start loving themselves,
understanding the value of themselves,

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:17.720
if they have the proper esteem,
the self-esteem, within themselves –

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.960
it's the time.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:22.680
The time has come,
which was prophesized.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:27.320
So, I really pay my all homage,

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.880
I should say, if you allow Me,

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:31.120
or, I should say, all my love

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.280
to the great son of this country,
William Blake, today.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:41.360
And, as a homage to Him,
you all should decide within yourself,

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:48.920
that you are not going to be soldiers,

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:53.440
carrying the swords
with the shaky hands,

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:58.040
or you’re not going to be afraid
of the horses on which you have to ride.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.400
You have to decide that
you have to be brave people.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:11.640
But bravery never means aggression,
it never means aggression.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.160
And that’s why that kind of a bravery

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:22.120
can only come into people
whose Spirits are awakened.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:30.040
So very happy today, to see these
beautiful happenings that He described,

00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:36.960
coming to reality.
I can see that coming down.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:42.120
So many poets have dreamt
about their country, in every country.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:46.720
But no-one has dreamt
like William Blake,

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.520
where He said positively
that this will be the Jerusalem,

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:57.920
means, the holy land of Jerusalem
will have to come down here.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.000
If the people have
that kind of a heart,

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.600
that kind of a throne,
the gods will have to come down.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:11.120
If you have that kind of a reception,
all the Divine has to go down.

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:15.600
But let us see if we have
that heart or not.

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.880
I hope – there are some new people today;

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:21.240
they may not understand many things
that I am saying,

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:24.560
just like as you do not understand
William Blake.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:29.320
But let Realization work it out,
have patience with yourself.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.720
We have to have patience.
And do not doubt yourselves.

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.240
Actually, mostly the doubts
are with yourself, not with Me.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:41.320
If you have no doubts,
that you are born at a very great times,

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:45.200
you will not doubt Me.
It happened in Rome;

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.640
the people in Italy
didn’t doubt Me at all,

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.960
didn’t doubt Me at all,
not even once.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:54.080
And they saw Me in dreams,
before I’d reached there.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.480
Imagine! So sensitive!
They said, “We knew, Mother.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.800
We saw your photograph,
we saw in the dream,

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:02.560
we saw your photograph.”
And they told Me how many times

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.000
they had dreams.
I mean, wonderful people there,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.240
I should say, though people say
that Italians are horrible people.

00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.880
But I, somehow or other,
get the cream, I think.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:16.560
Such wonderful people they were,
and they all got Realization.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:19.720
In this country, I have struggled
for eight years,

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:25.320
and the number may be the same.
So, this is what it is.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:30.560
We have to little bit accelerate.
The heart is rather lethargic.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:38.640
The lethargy has to be overcome,
and has to be done with love.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.680
I’m sure you have had
some introductions before.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:50.520
And now all the people
who are Sahaja Yogis here,

00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.720
are so many in this Hampstead,

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.520
they have to be really
rejoicing today,

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:05.800
that what William Blake has said
in those days, is seen happening.

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:11.160
Those Sahaja Yogis who are still
not up to mark should also today

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:17.920
take a vow, that they will go all-out
to see that they come up to it.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:35:29.680
Thank you very much.
May God bless you all.
