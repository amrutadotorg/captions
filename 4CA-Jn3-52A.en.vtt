WEBVTT

01:46.369 --> 01:53.369
It

02:05.689 --> 02:12.689
is such a pleasure today – and

03:04.690 --> 03:11.690
great fortune that here, where William Blake
lived, and He sang those songs of the greatness

03:25.730 --> 03:32.730
of this country, the future that it has to
be, the dreams He saw, have now come to shape,

03:39.769 --> 03:46.769
that we are here to celebrate His anniversary.
Things go beyond words – you cannot express

03:59.290 --> 04:06.290
yourself. Many people do not understand Him
because He wrote it, according to them, in

04:08.920 --> 04:13.090
abstract language – or in the language that
He understood. But I am happy that Sahaja

04:13.090 --> 04:20.090
Yogis understand Him so well, and the prophesies
that He made about England. People used to

04:24.060 --> 04:31.060
[rebuke ?] and ridicule it. Even today they
can’t believe that Jerusalem can be built

04:41.729 --> 04:48.729
in England. They cannot believe that people
who have been all their lives, for ages together,

04:55.349 --> 05:02.349
thought of nothing but materialism, can take
to spirituality to this extent that it becomes

05:02.620 --> 05:07.900
Jerusalem, and that the whole world comes
to pay homage to this Holy Land. That this

05:07.900 --> 05:14.900
becomes the Holy Land. In fact, He dreamt,
He wished it, because He knew the value of

05:18.849 --> 05:25.849
this land. This land has been touched by Christ’s
feet. Since long, people knew about Kundalini.

05:32.909 --> 05:39.909
Even if that is lost, for history it remains.
And He knew about it, He spoke about it. In

05:46.340 --> 05:52.469
His lifetime, maybe, people never understood
him – they must have thought that He’s

05:52.469 --> 05:59.139
really a madman, or something, a fantasist,
or some sort of a poet – He doesn’t understand.

05:59.139 --> 06:06.139
But what He wrote, every word of it, is the
truth. Such a great soul should live in Hampstead,

06:06.910 --> 06:13.910
itself is such a blessing. With such people,
even if they write or not, they leave their

06:21.120 --> 06:26.500
mark. Their ascent becomes the milestone for
the people who live there: their aspirations

06:26.500 --> 06:30.180
become different, their priorities become
different – the change is so subtle; is

06:30.180 --> 06:37.180
to be seen, to be felt, to be understood.
And very sensitive people only can be born

06:38.509 --> 06:45.509
in such places. Of course, there could be
very bad people also, who counteract, but

06:45.870 --> 06:52.870
the sensitivity of the atmosphere attracts
such souls to that place who are sensitive.

06:54.050 --> 07:01.050
You can see from His poems that He was absolutely
authoritative. He knew the authority, He had

07:05.500 --> 07:10.069
the authority. He talked like a man with complete
authority. He had no doubt – [He/Truth ?] has

07:10.069 --> 07:17.069
no doubts. He just said, ‘This is going
to happen,’ and, like a great warrior – that

07:20.479 --> 07:27.479
He knew that one has to fight the negativity,
one has to fight only dark problems. The Spirit

07:30.509 --> 07:37.509
has to fight all the time the matter. And
that’s how He talked, spoke, wrote as a

07:40.349 --> 07:47.349
warrior would do, because He started the fight
when He was born, hundred years back. And

07:54.520 --> 08:01.520
to Me He’s very great, because He said all
these things; He prepared the stage for Sahaja

08:09.060 --> 08:16.060
Yoga. Because He wrote all these things, we
can say that this was all said. Because human

08:18.840 --> 08:23.620
beings are such, unless and until it is said
before, ‘[INAUDIBLE] will ask, ‘what is

08:23.620 --> 08:29.710
the reference for what you are saying?’
You have to give reference for everything,

08:29.710 --> 08:34.449
you see – whatever is written, according
to them, is scripture, it’s the last word.

08:34.449 --> 08:37.050
Whether the book is published in any crack
list, doesn’t matter [INAUDIBLE]. It is

08:37.050 --> 08:44.050
such a great thing He’s done, but He’s
not done it for any material things, or for

08:49.120 --> 08:55.730
any fame, or anything that is [INAUDIBLE]
popular. But He’s done it for something

08:55.730 --> 09:02.730
that He’s very concerned with, and that
is the awakening of human beings. That is

09:06.890 --> 09:13.890
their second birth, that is the knowledge
of the Self. These words cannot come from

09:16.480 --> 09:22.209
a man who’s a weakling, who is a doubting
fellow, who doesn’t know where he stands,

09:22.209 --> 09:29.209
he’s confused, he’s a drunkard or he’s
an alcoholic sort of a [INAUDIBLE] or a madcap.

09:29.680 --> 09:36.680
They cannot. And it cannot come from an egoistical
man [INAUDIBLE] – a man who dominates others,

09:37.180 --> 09:42.089
who believes in robbing other countries and
going to other countries and rob them, and

09:42.089 --> 09:49.089
go to another house and rob them. Not from
them. It comes from a person who knows the

09:49.660 --> 09:56.660
value of the soil on which he’s born, the
spiritual value, not [INAUDIBLE to steal?].

09:57.660 --> 10:04.660
And it’s so subtle, so subtle, every word
is so subtle, that it’s like a channel,

10:04.959 --> 10:11.959
it’s like a channel. You are specially blessed
because such a great hero was born in this

10:15.610 --> 10:22.610
country. And, wherever I go, in My series
of lectures, at least in one lecture I always

10:32.850 --> 10:36.670
mention Him.

10:36.670 --> 10:42.970
He has gone into great detail, just like Markandeya,
another great poet in India, who was born

10:42.970 --> 10:49.970
thousands of years back. But He realized that
this country is the heart of the universe,

10:52.529 --> 10:55.260
and here the [gentleman?] [INAUDIBLE]. Nobody
could have thought hundred years back [INAUDIBLE],

10:55.260 --> 10:58.000
even less. Even thirty years back, nobody
could understand from the Spirit, even, I

10:58.000 --> 11:05.000
would say, ten years back. People have suffered
to call this as the Holy Land. It is the Holy

11:05.079 --> 11:12.079
Land. You can see that – because so many
people have got realization. And you are the

11:16.130 --> 11:23.130
ones who [SOUNDS LIKE have to make it ?]. This
is the heart. Whatever the imagery, whether

11:25.899 --> 11:32.630
right or wrong, it’s all calculated. So
they don’t understand at this point, because

11:32.630 --> 11:38.820
they don’t know it is the heart. Heart of
the universe. If you do wrong, all right:

11:38.820 --> 11:45.820
the whole world does that. You can see that,
among all the western countries, you are the

11:46.260 --> 11:53.260
wisest. That’s what Blake has told – I
don’t know how far [INAUDIBLE] they believe

11:57.010 --> 12:04.010
– it’s English – even Arabs. If you
say it is English, they believe. How far it

12:10.360 --> 12:16.260
is true for them. And the values that He cherished,
the dreams that He saw, and the aspirations

12:16.260 --> 12:21.279
He had were so great that one has to know
that there must be something in this land

12:21.279 --> 12:28.279
that works out. He was not mad, in any way.
Nowhere, no poet in any country has written

12:32.180 --> 12:39.180
like that. It was given clearly a chance,
the authority, that means you must circulate.

12:41.010 --> 12:48.010
Circulate with the heart, that circulates,
caters, looks after the whole body. And, once

12:48.389 --> 12:55.389
it collapses, the whole body collapses. Not
so. The English heart has to become the heart

12:56.070 --> 13:03.070
of William Blake, and not the chicken-hearted
one, or the aggressive one, or the hatred-filled

13:08.320 --> 13:15.320
[INAUDIBLE], or the [INAUDIBLE]. Because the
blood flows through you. He realizes, He understands

13:16.630 --> 13:20.269
the quality of an Englishman is very, very
great.

13:20.269 --> 13:27.269
In the heart resides the Spirit. Sahaja Yogis
know this, that, till a certain stage it resides

13:40.589 --> 13:47.589
in the heart. So, it’s a very, very great
position you occupy, so that you people become

14:00.350 --> 14:07.350
aware of its importance. Also, that you are
the [INAUDIBLE], the important sense of the

14:13.459 --> 14:20.459
heart. Heart doesn’t think, doesn’t – is
[absolutely ?] love. It’s love. When you

14:28.019 --> 14:35.019
think, you must know you’re not Englishmen
as described by Blake. But if you love, you

14:41.250 --> 14:48.250
are. And love doesn’t mean [INAUDIBLE] love,
or carnal love, or all kinds of ideas of love,

14:55.360 --> 15:01.060
charity work. It means the love of the Spirit
which is awakened within you – it just emits

15:01.060 --> 15:08.060
it. It just emits. It doesn’t think, it
just emits; it doesn’t think that whether

15:08.810 --> 15:15.810
it should give to the black or the white;
whether it should give it to the rich or the

15:19.350 --> 15:26.350
poor. It just loves. It flows. And that is
why one should get realization in England.

15:28.009 --> 15:35.009
Very important. Without realization, you cannot
grow, you cannot give – you will never understand

15:36.490 --> 15:43.490
the value of giving. You will never enjoy
giving. You will never know the beauty of

15:48.079 --> 15:53.680
generosity unless and until you become the
Self. You are the centre of the heart. It’s

15:53.680 --> 16:00.680
a most important position, as I told you – it’s
the most vital particle of [INAUDIBLE].

16:08.269 --> 16:15.269
And the one who is the heart has to be like
a lion. He roared, actually roars, if you

16:18.670 --> 16:25.670
read these things, like a lion He roars. He
has to be like a lion. And not to be frightened,

16:28.579 --> 16:33.920
like English language is, ‘I’m afraid’.
It starts with ‘I’m afraid’, and ends

16:33.920 --> 16:36.579
with ‘I’m afraid’. What are you afraid
of? Every person is afraid of you. What are

16:36.579 --> 16:43.579
you afraid of? You have to change your language.
You have to speak like – Sahaja Yogis have

16:48.410 --> 16:55.410
to speak like William Blake. The way He spoke,
about His great country, about the soil in

17:02.190 --> 17:08.780
which He was born, about the people who will
be born here, who will be Sahaja Yogis – He

17:08.780 --> 17:15.780
has described them so well: that men of God
will be born on this soil. Men of God. Special.

17:18.179 --> 17:25.179
The chosen ones. Not those who have branded
themselves as chosen. Most of the chosen ones

17:26.889 --> 17:33.889
are going towards the hell only. But the really
chosen ones will be born on this soil. And

17:37.580 --> 17:44.580
they will become prophets. Not only that,
but they’ll have a special power to make

17:45.760 --> 17:52.760
others prophets. He saw it. At that time,
He could see that you all are going to become

17:53.450 --> 18:00.450
prophets, and that you all are going to make
others prophets. Like one enlightened light

18:02.639 --> 18:09.639
can light another. He could see so clearly.
What a clear heart He must be having! What

18:12.500 --> 18:18.310
a clear vision He must be having. What a clear
brain He must be having. To receive all this

18:18.310 --> 18:23.520
information about [you ?]. So you have to
become. Is the point. You may be God’s people,

18:23.520 --> 18:30.520
but you have to become a prophet. Unless and
until you are a prophet, what’s the use

18:32.530 --> 18:39.050
of choosing you also, what’s the use of
your being born? You all have to become prophets.

18:39.050 --> 18:46.050
And, to become a prophet, Kundalini has to
be awakened, you are to be realized, and you’ll

18:47.030 --> 18:54.030
get these special powers of realization. People
can’t believe it that, in Sahaja Yoga today,

18:54.860 --> 18:56.549
if you get realization, you can give realization
to others. When I went to Rome the people

18:56.549 --> 19:03.549
had this doubt, I felt, when I said that,
‘Next moment you can give realization to

19:04.830 --> 19:09.419
others’. And they just could not believe
it, that they can feel the Kundalini, they

19:09.419 --> 19:14.460
can give realization – it’s too much to
believe, isn’t it? It’s too fantastic.

19:14.460 --> 19:21.460
So, the last day, I said, ‘All those who
have felt the cool breeze can stand behind

19:21.950 --> 19:25.770
the people who have not felt the cool breeze’.
They are very nice people, I must say, these

19:25.770 --> 19:29.450
people in Rome, because I think they have
reached the conclusion of complete frustration

19:29.450 --> 19:36.450
with their seeking. So they stood up behind
each [other/of them?]. And they were amazed.

19:36.600 --> 19:40.549
They could raise the Kundalini; they could
give realization. They said, ‘Mother, we

19:40.549 --> 19:44.309
got realization only yesterday’, some of
them. ‘That’s all right; you could have

19:44.309 --> 19:50.770
done it yesterday, but today you are doing
it now’. ‘You could have done it immediately,

19:50.770 --> 19:57.770
but this is what it is. Fantastic.’ So there
is no place for you to have any doubts; don’t

19:59.020 --> 20:02.720
waste your energy in doubts. You have done
that before. Bit too much. Now the time has

20:02.720 --> 20:09.720
come for you to get your realization, to get
enlightened, to understand. But there are

20:10.750 --> 20:17.100
still people who are on the fence, and they
are neither this way nor that. And Christ

20:17.100 --> 20:24.100
has described them very well. He said, ‘I
don’t mind hot or cold.’ I mean, the people

20:26.720 --> 20:31.750
who get the cool breeze, of course they are
first class. Even those get hot, are all right,

20:31.750 --> 20:38.750
because they would like to get rid of their
hot. But the half-way I don’t like. I’ll

20:38.960 --> 20:45.960
spit them out of My mouth. The ones who go
three steps forward and four steps backwards;

20:46.289 --> 20:53.289
such people are really a headache to Sahaja
Yoga, I tell you. If they get out, it’s

20:53.909 --> 20:57.610
much better. Half-hearted people in Sahaja
Yoga are of no use, which was told by Christ,

20:57.610 --> 21:03.220
long time back, but I don’t know if people
really realize what they’re like. And this

21:03.220 --> 21:09.799
is the problem I have faced in this country
a bit too much. The maximum in this country,

21:09.799 --> 21:14.850
to be very frank. The ego is of a subtle nature,
such a subtle nature, in this country – every

21:14.850 --> 21:21.850
country has a different type. Like we can
say in Spain it is like the bullfighter. In

21:22.890 --> 21:29.890
Rome it is the artists; they think they are
great artists, [you see ?]- they have a sense

21:31.380 --> 21:34.289
of beauty. [Oh,] all sorts of things.

21:34.289 --> 21:41.289
But, in this country, you must know what sort
of an ego you people have. Is thinking that,

21:42.190 --> 21:49.190
‘Nobody could be better than us. We are
the topmost people.’ You see, that upper

21:50.049 --> 21:57.049
– what do you call it – upper lip? Stiff
upper lip. I mean, they themselves laugh at

22:01.020 --> 22:08.020
themselves – it’s a good idea. But it’s
true; I have seen it. That stiff upper lip

22:08.880 --> 22:14.260
is the point; that doesn’t make you to smile,
laugh – I mean, even if you certify that

22:14.260 --> 22:21.260
you can smile now, they would not. That sort
of a thing, this makes you very insensitive.

22:22.210 --> 22:29.210
As if the ego comes down from there and settles
down on the lip. [It/they ?] cannot – there’s

22:29.669 --> 22:36.669
no wobbling on the lips, nothing. What – such
a terrifying face sometimes. [INAUDIBLE] You

22:42.159 --> 22:49.159
find that. It takes nothing to smile, to be
congenial. We are all human beings – we

22:55.150 --> 23:01.890
are not dogs, that we should bark at each
other. That we [should be frowning – I think

23:01.890 --> 23:02.140
She corrects Herself here] that we should
frown at each other. First thing we have to

23:02.100 --> 23:09.100
learn, that we are the heart sense, and that
we have to love. Without love, you cannot

23:09.150 --> 23:16.150
be called an Englishman, according to Mr William
Blake. I don’t say anything, because I don’t

23:16.470 --> 23:23.470
want to be hanged. According to Him. So, first
of all, let us know if we can really love

23:29.720 --> 23:35.720
ourselves. That’s the biggest problem. The
first disease He did not know. Perhaps William

23:35.720 --> 23:40.390
Blake did not know what I will have to face.
I wish He had written all that. The first

23:40.390 --> 23:47.390
disease the people have here, apart from the
upper lip, is Left Vishuddhi – means guilt.

23:50.640 --> 23:56.610
They may be Catholic or not, does not matter.
But they have this built-in guilt within themselves

23:56.610 --> 24:03.610
for nothing. First of all, you must give up
your guilt. I think He did not know – William

24:04.720 --> 24:11.679
Blake did not know that people will develop
this, because at that time they were not like

24:11.679 --> 24:18.679
that?. And this is such a big problem, which
I have been facing, since I came to this country.

24:21.360 --> 24:28.360
You know, first four years, I was struggling
with people who had [INAUDIBLE done different

24:30.179 --> 24:35.470
things ?]. And the problem they had that,
I said, ‘Why do you take drugs? What is

24:35.470 --> 24:42.470
there to be living this way for? For what
are you living? I should [call you spirits/your

24:44.900 --> 24:50.500
Spirit?].’ So they take spirits, you see.
English language [INAUDIBLE]. You can say

24:50.500 --> 24:53.080
it is the Spirit in the heart, you can say
the spirit you drink. Or the spirit – that

24:53.080 --> 25:00.080
is what we call a bhoot in the Indian language
– means a dead one, dead soul, a dead person.

25:04.650 --> 25:08.330
So this is the advantage, and that's how they
were indulging into spirits. But the problem

25:08.330 --> 25:15.330
with them is, it was such a vicious circle
that, if you tried to correct them, they would

25:19.279 --> 25:26.279
recede into themselves and get into [dilemmas/damage?].
And say that, ‘We are good-for-nothing,

25:27.470 --> 25:34.470
useless people.' All right. Then I would encourage
them, say, 'No, no, you are wonderful people

25:34.520 --> 25:38.480
in the universe. You don’t worry’, [This,
that/Praise that?], every sort of a [pamper?].

25:38.480 --> 25:45.480
Then they would become ego oriented; it was
impossible. And the story of people who are

25:54.380 --> 26:01.380
always described in a mathematics paper – you
see, when they give you in the, say, seventh

26:08.059 --> 26:15.059
standard, sixth standard, you get a question
like this: ‘A house was to be built, and

26:18.360 --> 26:25.360
in that village one Mr A came to work, he
did only 1/16 of the work and he ran away.

26:25.380 --> 26:30.809
And another came in, who did only 1/50 of
the work, and ran away. And then the third

26:30.809 --> 26:36.309
one came, who did only the 1/100 of the work
and disappeared. So when will the work be

26:36.309 --> 26:43.309
finished? Never! Is the answer. If you have
all run away and those who are escapists [Mother

26:43.700 --> 26:48.640
says escapisists], how can the work be finished
with these people who always escape? Simple

26:48.640 --> 26:54.750
answer is never. You may calculate it, go
on calculating it – your answer is never.

26:54.750 --> 27:00.429
Is the [SOUNDS LIKE point?]. If you want to
escape the situation, if you want to escape

27:00.429 --> 27:04.289
yourself, if you want to escape the present,
you will never reach there, where you have

27:04.289 --> 27:11.289
to reach. And you are never going to be satisfied
with yourself; you are not going to be happy,

27:11.659 --> 27:18.409
either. So you have to face it; you have to
face it, as it is, and stand up. That’s

27:18.409 --> 27:25.179
what He said, that, “You bring the arrow
to Me, I’ll face it.” Like a brave man

27:25.179 --> 27:32.179
you have to face it, and not to become, ‘I’m
afraid’. You are not escapers, you are Sufis.

27:34.649 --> 27:41.649
Inside, outside, you are [pedigree/very good
?]; you are the Spirit. And, if you are the

27:43.970 --> 27:50.970
Spirit, why should you escape yourself – I
just can’t understand. Just face it, and

27:51.740 --> 27:58.740
the Spirit will shine. Just face it with that
bravery – face it! And you will be amazed

28:00.289 --> 28:07.289
that you are really beautiful. No doubt about
it. You have to just see, because you are

28:07.600 --> 28:14.600
the Self of the heart. But it won’t be an
exaggeration if I say, in the body, everything

28:16.380 --> 28:23.380
depends on the heart. If you fail, the responsibility
will be yours. You’ve a very big responsibility

28:28.040 --> 28:35.040
– and a very sweet one. Because heart doesn’t
think, thinking is madness; it loves; it loves

28:36.309 --> 28:43.309
and enjoys itself. It’s such a sweet work
you have to do; for that you start from yourself.

28:45.529 --> 28:50.070
First of all, love yourself – which is a
very difficult thing for people to love themselves.

28:50.070 --> 28:57.070
The hatred starts from within – you hate
yourself and then you start hating everyone,

28:57.159 --> 29:02.350
and it’s very common to say, ‘I hate you’,
second moment, ‘I love you’. God knows

29:02.350 --> 29:07.570
what they mean. But the main thing is that
they do not love themselves. If they start

29:07.570 --> 29:13.000
loving themselves, understanding the value
of themselves, if they have the proper esteem,

29:13.000 --> 29:18.029
the self-esteem, within themselves - that’s
the time. The time has come, which was prophesized.

29:18.029 --> 29:25.029
So, I really pay My all – homage, I should
say, if you allow Me, or, I should say all

29:28.149 --> 29:35.149
My love to the great Son of this country,
William Blake, today. And, as a homage to

29:37.649 --> 29:44.649
Him, you all should decide within yourself
that you are not going to be soldiers, carrying

29:49.330 --> 29:56.330
the swords with the shaky hands, or you’re
not going to be afraid of the horses on which

29:59.630 --> 30:06.500
you have to ride. You have to decide that
you have to be brave people. But bravery never

30:06.500 --> 30:13.500
means aggression – it never means aggression.
And that’s why that kind of a bravery can

30:15.600 --> 30:22.600
only come into people whose Spirits are awakened.
So very happy today, to see these beautiful

30:25.370 --> 30:32.370
happenings that He described, coming to reality.
I can see that coming down. So many poets

30:37.830 --> 30:44.580
have dreamt about their country – every
country. But no-one has dreamt like William

30:44.580 --> 30:51.580
Blake, where He said positively that this
will be [the ?] Jerusalem. Means, the holy

30:51.630 --> 30:58.630
land of Jerusalem will have to come down.
If the people have that kind of a heart, that

31:00.960 --> 31:07.960
kind of a poem, the gods will have to come
down. If you have that kind of a reception.

31:24.539 --> 31:31.539
All the Divine has to go down. But let us
see if we have that heart or not. I hope – there

31:41.809 --> 31:48.809
are some new people today; they may not understand
many things that I am saying, just like as

31:53.159 --> 31:59.399
you do not understand William Blake. But let
realization work it out. Have patience – we

31:59.399 --> 32:03.539
have to have patience. And do not doubt yourselves.
Actually, mostly the doubts are with yourself,

32:03.539 --> 32:10.539
not with Me. If you have no doubts, that you
are born at a very great times, you will not

32:13.630 --> 32:20.630
doubt. It happened in Rome; the people in
Italy didn’t doubt Me at all, didn’t doubt

32:25.510 --> 32:32.510
Me at all, not even once. And they saw Me
in dreams, before I’d reached there – imagine!

32:39.500 --> 32:46.500
So sensitive. They said, ‘We knew, Mother.
We saw Your photograph, we saw in the dream,

32:52.240 --> 32:59.240
we saw Your photograph.’ And they told Me
how many times they had dreams. I mean, wonderful

33:07.820 --> 33:14.820
people, I should say! Some people say that
Italians are horrible people. But I somehow

33:22.019 --> 33:29.019
or other get the cream, I think. Such wonderful
people they were – and they all got realization.

33:45.380 --> 33:52.380
In this country, I have struggled for eight
years, and the number may be the same. So

34:04.610 --> 34:11.610
this is what it is. We have to little bit
accelerate – the heart is rather lethargic.

34:22.169 --> 34:29.169
But lethargy has to be overcome, and has to
be done with love. I’m sure you have had

34:57.359 --> 35:04.359
some introductions before, and now all the
people who are Sahaja Yogis here are so many

35:14.720 --> 35:21.720
in this Hampstead; they have to be really
rejoicing today. That what William Blake has

35:26.740 --> 35:33.740
said in those days, we’ve seen happen. Those
Sahaja Yogis who are still not up to the mark

35:40.140 --> 35:47.140
should also today take a vow that they will
go all-out to see that they come up.

35:52.890 --> 35:55.880
May God bless you!

35:55.880 --> 36:01.600
Now, if people have any questions, they can
ask them, because there are some new people,

36:01.600 --> 36:07.580
I think. Would be a good idea.
I [INAUDIBLE] that so many types of people

36:07.580 --> 36:14.580
are here, that I don’t know how many languages
you will have to translate, but later on,

36:31.680 --> 36:38.680
you can translate. They’re all catching
right now. All right. [Doesn’t matter ?]. [INAUDIBLE].

36:43.430 --> 36:50.430
People are [from ?] Portugal are here, so
what they’ll miss you will speak, isn’t

36:52.080 --> 36:59.080
it? In this lifetime only I have learnt English,
and that not so well.

37:03.370 --> 37:10.370
If there are any questions, for five minutes,
and then we can have the realization.

37:15.400 --> 37:22.400
You can all put your hands towards Me, like
this. I’m sorry, you have to take out your

37:55.069 --> 38:02.069
shoes, because of the cold weather, maybe,
you don’t have any proper things here? Put

38:26.489 --> 38:33.489
your hands towards Me, just like that.

38:33.640 --> 38:40.640
Now, the first thing is, that you all are
going to get your realization – not to get

38:52.239 --> 38:59.239
frustrated, in no way, and you are not to
do anything, just keep quiet, close your eyes,

39:08.449 --> 39:15.449
and put your hands towards Me. That’s all.
Simple as that. You are not to do anything

39:27.529 --> 39:34.529
– no effort at all. Just leave it. And it
will work out, I’m sure, so don’t worry

39:59.170 --> 40:06.170
about it. Please keep your eyes shut. That’s
important. Because, when the Kundalini rises

40:27.330 --> 40:34.330
above this Agnya chakra, it dilates the pupil
before it pierces [through ?]. So, it’s

40:50.690 --> 40:57.690
better that you keep your eyes shut. It will
help you.

41:19.130 --> 41:24.579
You will feel a cool breeze in your hand.
Now, there’s no autosuggestion, or anything

41:24.579 --> 41:29.199
– if you don’t feel it, you don’t feel
it. If you feel it, OK. That is the breeze

41:29.199 --> 41:36.199
of the Holy Ghost. You can ask the question,
‘Is this the breeze of

41:46.350 --> 41:52.330
the Holy Ghost?’, and you’ll get it. Cold
wind of the Holy Ghost in this cold weather.

41:52.330 --> 41:59.330
Can you feel it? Close your eyes, it’s better,
because very subtle, it’s a subtle thing.

42:14.529 --> 42:21.529
And we live on a gross plane. So it’s a
subtle thing; best is to keep your eyes shut,

42:42.500 --> 42:49.500
so that you can feel it better. And pay attention
to

44:27.930 --> 44:34.930
your fingertips, where you’ll feel it.

44:40.640 --> 44:47.640
Stretch the hands a little bit. Stretch them
a little bit – not much. So keep comfortable.

45:13.580 --> 45:20.580
You may ask a question, in your heart, ‘Whatever
Mother is saying about William Blake, is

46:29.170 --> 46:36.170
it true?’ That’s a simple question [to
ask/for now]. Put the fingers towards Me;

47:02.170 --> 47:09.170
don’t push them towards yourself. Towards
Me; stretch, stretch your fingers. Just ask

48:49.560 --> 48:56.560
the question, simple question. Now put your
right hand on your heart, and ask the question,

50:12.009 --> 50:19.009
‘Mother, am I the Spirit?’ Ask inside;
ask three times. Please ask three times. ‘Mother,

50:33.699 --> 50:37.859
am I the Spirit?’

50:37.859 --> 50:44.859
Now put the same hand down below, on the stomach,
on the left side, and say, ‘Mother, am I

51:13.529 --> 51:20.529
my own Guru? Am I my own Master?’ Ask it.
Now put the hand much higher, towards the

51:50.529 --> 51:57.529
neck, on the left side, and say, ‘Mother,
I’m not guilty,’ Say it thrice. Say it

52:43.500 --> 52:50.500
thrice, please, all of you, ‘Mother, I’m
not guilty at all.’

52:55.480 --> 53:02.480
Now, put your hand on your head. On the fontanel
bone area. And now say, ‘Mother, please

53:19.830 --> 53:26.830
give me my Realization.’ Because it is your
freedom to ask for it. If you don’t ask

54:27.560 --> 54:34.560
for it, I cannot force on you. I cannot force.
Your freedom is to be respected. Just say

55:00.370 --> 55:07.370
‘Mother, please give me my Realization.’
On top of your head, here, on the fontanel

56:06.480 --> 56:13.480
bone area, where the children have a very,
very soft bone. Just ask, ‘Mother, please

56:43.359 --> 56:50.359
give me my Self-Realization.’ It’s your
own, but you

57:39.890 --> 57:46.890
have

58:50.230 --> 58:57.230
to ask; nobody can force it
on you. Say it thrice. Now, lift your hand
up there, and see if there’s a cool breeze

01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:19.730
coming out. Or a hot – maybe some people
who are new might get hot, little bit.

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:35.420
So, put both the hands towards Me, and see
if
the cool breeze is coming out. Even

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:57.850
the new people. Keep your eyes shut. Don’t
think about it; don’t think. By thinking

01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:15.920
you are not going to get it.

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:22.920
May God bless you!

01:03:23.739 --> 01:03:30.739
All right? Vishuddhi. Don’t feel guilty,
please don’t – at first I said that

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:09.960
you are not

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:50.540
to feel guilty. Now you better say it eight
times.

01:06:25.989 --> 01:06:32.989
(LONG SILENCE)

01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:49.890
Ah, better. All right, are

01:07:50.429 --> 01:07:57.429
you feeling the cool breeze? Good, enjoy yourself.
Are you? Are

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:07.000
you

01:13:10.290 --> 01:13:16.290
feeling the cool breeze in the hands?

01:13:16.290 --> 01:13:23.290
Those who are feeling the cool breeze can
open their eyes, slowly, but do not think.

01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:38.570
You

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:59.480
can watch Me without thinking. Otherwise,
better is

01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:59.840
to keep them closed. If you

01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:54.820
can slowly open them. You

01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:34.150
just watch Me without thinking.
