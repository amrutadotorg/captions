00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:26.480
Today, we are all going to worship

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.880
Me,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.800
first time.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.480
It has been always the puja

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.800
of aspect of Me or a part of Me.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:49.640
Now, one has to know very clearly what is Adi Shakti.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.800
As we say, is the pure desire of God Almighty,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.720
of Sadashiva.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:04.800
But what is the pure desire of God Almighty?

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.040
If you see your own desires

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.960
come out of what?

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.960
Not of the divine Love,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.040
but out of carnal love,

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.240
out of material love,

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.640
out of power-love.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.480
Behind all these desires there is love.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.800
If you do not love something, you will not desire it.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.960
So these mundane type of loves that you have,

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.440
for which we spend so much of our time,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.560
uselessly,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:08:00.720
actually they do not give you satisfaction,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.000
because that’s not true love that you have,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.160
just infatuation for the time being

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.560
and then you just get fed up with it

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.720
and from here you jump to another thing,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.480
to another thing, to another thing.

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.840
So Adi Shakti is embodiment

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.600
of God’s divine Love.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.320
It’s God’s pure love,

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.480
and in His love, what did He desire?

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:46.320
He desired that He should create human beings

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:51.160
who would be very obedient,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:56.320
would be sublime,

00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.480
would be like angels.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:06.320
And that was His idea, is to create Adam and Eve.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.800
So, angels have no freedom.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.880
Angels are made like that.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.240
They are fixed.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.320
They don’t know why they do it.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.080
Animals also don’t know why they do certain things.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.560
They just do it,

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.480
because they are bound by nature.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.480
They are bound by God Almighty.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.560
They say Shiva is Pashupati,

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.960
means he controls all the animals,

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.960
He’s Pashupati.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.080
He controls all the animals,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.400
so all the desires from animals come in,

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.880
but they don’t repent,

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.720
they don’t have ego,

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.080
they don’t think that this is wrong,

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.400
or that is good.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.720
They have no karma problem

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.240
because they have no ego,

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.800
because they have no freedom.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.240
At this point

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:21.480
Adi Shakti, which was pure Love

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.040
so think of a Father who has put

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.240
all his Love into one personality

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.720
then what is left in Him is nothing,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.800
He is just watching.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.880
Then what does He think,

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:42.480
He is just watching the play of His desire,

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.480
of His love.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.800
He’s watching it, how it is working out.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.400
And when He is watching that, then He is very careful,

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.240
because He knows

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.400
that this personality that I have created

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:02.640
is nothing but love and compassion.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:08.960
And compassion itself is of such a noble variety,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.240
that He cannot bear anybody

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.320
challenging that compassion,

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.480
troubling that compassion,

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.240
or also in any way demeaning it,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.640
lowering it or insulting it.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.800
He’s so alert on that point.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.320
And He is very watchful.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.320
So a rift has taken place, we should say,

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:41.640
from Him, from His own desire of love.

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:48.880
Now this desire of love was also given a personality,

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:56.240
means ego, and that this ego has to act on its own.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:06.400
It became sort of an, very independent personality,

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.560
which was free, to do whatever it liked.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.040
I mean we cannot think in our mundane life

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.240
that a husband and wife are absolutely free

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.960
to do what they like.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.560
Because there is no cohesion,

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.800
there is no understanding,

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:28.400
there is no, not that oneness, that rapport.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.880
But it’s like a moon and moonlight,

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.720
sun and sunlight,

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.480
it’s such a cohesion,

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:40.720
that whatever one does, another enjoys.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:47.320
And in that beautiful rift,

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.480
Adi Shakti decided to change His plans.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:55.560
Is known for Her Sankalpa Vikalpa Karoti

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.040
anything you try to decide too much,

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:04.480
She will make it break, like today’s eleven o’clock puja.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.960
So when this Adam and Eve business started,

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.480
She thought that they will be just like other animals or angels,

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.640
what’s the use? They must know what they are doing,

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.320
they must know why they are doing it.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:27.800
They must have the freedom to understand

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.320
what is the knowledge.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.640
And – like fixed machine-like life

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.320
that these animals are having –

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.640
why should they have?

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.640
So, in Her arbitrary power,

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.880
which was conceded, of course,

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.720
She is the one, who came as a serpent

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.400
and told them that “You taste the fruit of knowledge.”

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.240
Now for people who are not Sahaja yogis,

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.880
you cannot tell this, they’ll be shocked.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:09.640
But this that serpent that came for them to test,

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.480
and then to tell them

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:17.200
that “You better taste this fruit.”

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.320
This serpent told the woman,

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.160
not the man

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.320
because woman is supposed to accept things easily.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.400
She may even accept bhoots, she may even accept nonsense,

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.640
but she’s the one who accepts.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:38.240
While the man doesn’t accept easily,

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.480
he argues, he discusses,

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.640
that’s why he came and told the woman

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.800
She came and told the woman I should say.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.800
This Holy Ghost actually is a feminine,

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.720
and so more nearer to a woman.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:02.320
This feminine force came as serpent and told

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:10.480
that better you taste the fruit of knowledge.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.560
Now it was the job of the lady,

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.880
Eve,

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.480
to convince her husband,

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:20.320
because women know how to do that.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.960
Sometimes they may convince them wrongly,

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.240
tell them something which is very wrong, very sinister.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.480
As you know in Macbeth, what happened.

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.880
So many places we have seen

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.880
women have misguided their husbands.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.320
But men can be misguided

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.240
or could be guided,

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.640
or could be emancipated

00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:46.040
if they have a proper wife.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:49.400
So he had all faith in his wife,

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.720
believed in it

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:54.240
and they tasted the fruit of knowledge,

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.960
under the guidance of this Holy Ghost,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.800
who was a feminine personality of God.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.560
This is … cannot be conceived

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.240
by the people who are just getting a glimpse of Christ

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.160
or a glimpse of Mohammed Sahib

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.640
or a glimpse of Nanak Sahib.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.800
They cannot understand.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.240
They just had a glimpse of them.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.480
If they had told, people would have said,

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.800
“Bah, what is this?”

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.160
They would have never listened to it.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.480
So, at that time, the way the attention was,

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.800
the way the reception was,

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:43.560
they told about dharma, about ascent.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:49.640
But in India people talked about Kundalini since long

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.400
and that She is the Adi Shakti,

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.640
reflected within us.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.800
Now you see, she’s already read it out to you,

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:05.040
that I will be in every one of them.

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:11.560
Now understand that this Adi Shakti is

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.880
the power of Love, of pure Love,

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:18.160
of compassion.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.160
There’s nothing else She has.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:25.800
Only the pure Love within Her heart.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.160
But this pure Love is so powerful,

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:31.160
is so powerful

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:35.040
that’s the Love She has given to this Mother Earth.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:37.560
Because of that this Mother Earth,

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.960
the amount of sins we may commit, we may do anything;

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.400
She is pouring out Her Love

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:48.240
through these beautiful things to all us.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:57.560
Now, we have also this beauty expressed

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.080
in every way of Her Love

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.240
through the galaxies you see, the stars you see.

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.160
Now if you want to see it from a scientific way,

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.400
then science means it has no love in it,

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.720
there’s no question of love.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.640
Even people talk of yoga,

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:20.880
where they don’t talk of love and compassion.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.240
When there is no love and compassion,

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:31.960
there cannot be any divine spark in that person.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:40.720
Everything is completely submerged in this divine Love.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.040
Everything that is created on this Earth,

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:47.240
everything that is created in this universe,

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.320
and universes, and universes,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:58.080
is all because of the Love of the Divine Mother.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:04.720
So this Adi Shakti’s Love is something so, so subtle,

00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:12.640
is so subtle, you cannot understand sometimes.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.320
I know you all love Me very much.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.480
It’s tremendous love for Me

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:27.400
and when I get the vibrations from you,

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.480
it’s like the ripples

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:35.040
that reach the shores and again they return back

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.520
and lots of little, little sparkling

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:42.960
drops are there on the shore also.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.280
In the same way in My heart,

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:54.200
I feel your love echoing the beauty of sparkle

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.400
in this divine Love,

00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:02.960
which I cannot explain to you the experience,

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.040
what it creates.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:10.880
The first thing that it creates, that tears come into My eyes.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.880
Because it’s the compassion,

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:15.560
which is sandra karuna;

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.720
is, is aadr, it’s not dry.

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.320
Like a father’s compassion could be very dry,

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.480
“All right, do this, otherwise I’ll shoot you, I’ll do this,”

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.880
he’ll say. Mother will say,

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:29.600
but She won’t say something that will be that hurting.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.560
She will have to say sometimes, to correct you.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.480
But Her saying is very different from the father’s,

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.880
because She has got sandra karuna.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:45.800
Andr. Aadr is the … which is not dry.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:52.560
And this kind of a heart She developed,

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.320
because of this divine Love that She was carrying.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.480
So every part of Her body,

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:03.320
everything is created out of divine Love.

00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:09.720
Every bit of it emits nothing but divine Love.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.040
Vibrations are nothing but divine Love.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.040
Now, as I’ve told you before also,

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:19.880
that this incarnation had to come.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.040
The time had come,

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:28.880
it was all being seen that the time had come.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.400
But there’s a difference between fixed time

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.040
and time which is sahaj.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.800
Fixed time is such that you can say

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.800
that this train leaves this time,

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.400
it will reach this time.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.480
You can say that

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.960
some machinery is producing something,

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.800
in such and such time it will produce so many things.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.160
But living things, which are spontaneous,

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.480
which are sahaj, you cannot say time.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:10.560
In the same way this process of freedom;

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.400
you have the maximum freedom,

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.880
so one could not say what time this will happen,

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.240
that people will be available

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:27.160
to receive this subtle knowledge of divine Love.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.120
Knowledge also could be very dry.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.040
We had terrible people in India,

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:37.760
who were busy with the reading

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:40.960
and with the citation of mantras, this, that,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.160
and they became so dry, so dry,

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.400
they’re just bone structures, they were, just bones left.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.320
And so hot-tempered that they looked at anybody,

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.480
that person would become into ashes.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.720
I mean, is this the way you have come on this Earth,

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.560
to do all the tapasyas, everything,

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.960
just to make somebody into ashes?

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.080
But that’s how they thought that

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.960
they were very great because they looked at somebody,

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:13.040
that person becomes, disappears or becomes ashes.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.600
Bhasmisat they call it.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.640
But there was no idea of benevolence in their heart.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.720
So, the first thing that is achieved

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.640
through this divine Love is your benevolence.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.880
Now benevolence itself is also

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.160
a kind of a very misguided word.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:40.960
Benevolence means whatever is good for your Spirit.

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:45.800
Now, as you know the Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty,

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:52.880
so when the Spirit in you starts

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.640
reflecting itself in its full beauty

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:01.880
then you become the giver,

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.400
you are no more a person who has to take anything,

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.480
you just become the giver. You are so fulfilled.

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:15.640
Now, this Advent came at a time which was judged

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.400
what time it should come.

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.160
As I said you had freedom,

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.480
people were going amok, doing all kinds of thing.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.800
So if you see that, just before this

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:34.800
we had a big problem of people working out their power.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.960
Like people will go to India

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:42.440
to occupy the territory of India, or to China,

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.640
or this side they went up to Africa

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.080
and all these places.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:51.560
Even Americans went to – so-called Americans –

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.160
went to America and occupied it.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.040
So this was the time when they were using their freedom

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.160
for power only.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.720
That was not the time for the Adi Shakti to be born.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.240
They were the people who were power-oriented.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.880
Not that today we don’t have, we have.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.880
But these were seeking only power

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.800
and also these territories,

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.480
which is not important.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.160
So it could not be at that time.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.320
At that time, one had to fight for your freedom,

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.240
for getting out of the clutches of these imperialists

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:34.000
and people who were trying to overpower.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.240
Now, gradually it changed.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:48.040
It changed, and changed in such a smooth way.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.880
Is very surprising,

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.800
I saw the change coming up Myself.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:55.640
It worked out.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.240
As you know that I Myself took part

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:05.480
in the freedom movement of India – is important.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.880
India started, in India it started.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.160
First the freedom, from imperialism,

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:16.720
and then gradually this freedom from imperialism

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.880
started spreading in every country.

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.880
People started thinking about it,

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.320
they started understanding

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.560
that no use having colonies and all that,

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.640
better come back to your own position.

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.040
So when this happened,

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.320
I mean this happened in My own lifetime, I must say

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.800
first, people who tried to have freedom in our country died,

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.960
so many were killed, you know, we had people like Bhagat Singh.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.480
In every country

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.800
all the revolutionaries were thrown out

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.560
and were ill-treated and killed.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.920
It’s not question of India only.

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.320
But that one had to go through.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:58.160
So their freedom was tested.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:01.240
Now they thought this was nonsensical thing we did,

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.960
this was no freedom.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.720
Because after all, doing all that, then they started repenting

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.960
and developing a kind of a fear

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.880
and a fright from others

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:18.960
and kind of a, what you can call,

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.480
a very disturbed Left Visshuddi started.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.800
They felt that … very guilty,

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.480
that they have done very wrong,

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.320
they should not have done it.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.800
At this juncture also

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:36.800
there were other problems,

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.880
like we had caste-systems

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.320
and other problems in slavery

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.880
and all kinds of things, disparities,

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.400
and some people were treated as lower people,

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.880
some as higher people, some higher races, some lower races,

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.480
all these stupid things were there.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:01.880
Through their freedom they have created this,

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.080
through their freedom.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:09.720
It’s not so, it’s not, it’s not the fact, it’s not the truth.

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.080
But they created a thing like that.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.320
Now supposing I want to create something here,

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.560
just to say, that “All right, this is not a carpet,”

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.160
go on telling you, “It’s not a carpet, it’s not a carpet.”

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.160
The brain is washed, you see, you think all,

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.480
“It’s not a carpet, must be something else.”

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.720
It’s like a mesmeric thing I feel,

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:35.000
the way people accepted this nonsense of racialism,

00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.600
of all kinds of disparities, of slavery,

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:45.080
of caste-system and specially ill-treating women.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:50.040
All this came out of the choice that was given to them

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.400
to select what is good, what is bad.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.040
So to them it was very good, you see,

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.920
it was a nice thing to do.

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.240
Under these circumstances,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.720
compassion would have been wasted on these people.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.320
Divine Love would have been a waste on them.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.960
Because mentally people were not prepared to understand;

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.560
you could not tell them

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:18.720
that this is absolutely out of your blindness,

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.560
ignorance, you are doing this;

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.480
this is not the right thing for you,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.000
this will not make you noble;

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:29.120
this is ignoble, you are doing ignoble things.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.160
Of course so many saints came,

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.080
they talked of nobility, of forgiveness,

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.480
of unity, of oneness, everything they said.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.320
Big seers were born,

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.960
they also reached that point to talk about it.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:47.200
But still people were not prepared so much.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.720
Gradually, I think, they had teachings and all that,

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.880
started working in people.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.800
But the biggest problem came

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.320
with these so-called religions that they started.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.480
These – all religions got derailed.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.800
And they formed kind of puddles, you see,

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.920
Muslims here, Christians here, Hindus there,

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:12.880
this is this, this is this.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.960
So, you really needed this giver of life

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.720
to fill up all these puddles

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.240
and make them one.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:25.640
It’s complete ignorance, it's sheer stupidity,

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:30.560
to think that one human being is higher than another.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.240
You can only say one thing,

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.320
that at a different state you are.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.080
Some are at a different state,

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.040
some are at a higher state,

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.800
but in general you cannot condemn somebody

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.160
that he is no good, this society is not good,

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.240
this society is … in general!

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.160
Individually you can say,

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.920
in general you cannot say.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.120
But this ignorance was so dark,

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.480
because it became collective,

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:02.680
it’s a collective ignorance. Collective ignorance!

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.160
They all joined hands together, collectively,

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.480
to say that this is the religion that is the best,

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.560
we are the only ones which are saved ones.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.640
Another said, “No no no no no no,

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:18.160
these are absolutely condemned people, we are the best.”

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.560
And under the name of religion,

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:29.240
under the name of God Almighty, they started this nonsense.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:36.480
So now, Adi Shakti had to assert,

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:40.320
put the complete force.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:46.880
So, the first thing She realized,

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:51.640
that one should know what is a family.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.040
A child grows in the family

00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:00.160
if the children do not get the proper attention

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.640
from the father or mother

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:07.520
we can say if they are also spoilt,

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.720
or if not spoilt, if they are overindulged into,

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.040
or they are neglected,

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:19.320
then the child doesn’t know what love is.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.480
If a child doesn’t know what love is

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:25.160
love doesn’t mean that you spoil the child,

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.160
or you give him lots of toys to play and get rid of him

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:34.800
it means that all the time your attention is on your child.

00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.480
And that attention is not indulgence,

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:41.960
but an attention for the benevolence of the child.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:47.160
So all the time you are seeing that there is benevolence.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.320
And thus, I thought the family life has to be,

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.560
first of all substantiated.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.480
It’s very important,

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.640
because these days also under the name of religion

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.720
they have started nunneries and then priests

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:07.960
and then sanyasis and all kinds of babas are there.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.480
They are so dry!

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.560
And they are so misleading to people,

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.960
that people started taking to this kind of sanyasa,

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.880
getting out of their houses,

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.480
running away from their wives, their children.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.040
So the first point I realized,

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.160
human beings cannot have love

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:34.040
who haven’t known what is love is.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:46.520
And this love is more effective if it is collective.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.480
See we, you must have seen that in India

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.240
people really love each other in a family.

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.960
I mean so many relations we don’t know

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.320
how we are related to them,

00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:58.560
we just call them brother, sister, this, that.

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:00.480
We don’t know what is the relationship is,

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.120
so whose father was, whose sister, nothing.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:08.640
But we just feel this is our brother,

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.480
and if you ask how is your brother you wouldn’t know how is your brother.

00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.320
The reason is we had joint family system,

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.320
the joint family system just like a collective system.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.720
So nobody knew who was whose real brother,

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:27.320
who was his step-brother, who was his cousin, nothing.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:34.520
They all lived together as just relations.

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.640
But then this also broke,

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:38.240
this joint family also broke

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.800
because of economic reasons and things like that,

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.160
whatever it is.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:47.520
So now at this time when … see these … very crucial time it was,

00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:51.160
when the people had to know love

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:58.040
and the family had started breaking in every country;

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.720
Especially say Western countries,

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:04.320
for men and women never realized

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.560
the importance of family life.

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:11.320
They never had faith in their family life.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.320
So it became such a shifty thing for poor children,

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:16.080
they were on shifting grounds

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.960
and they couldn’t grow properly.

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.880
So they created a generation of violent,

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:27.440
horribly possessed children.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:34.480
This generation then went into war-mongering;

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.160
they don’t know, they feel like fighting.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.480
I have seen children fighting with a tree.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.560
I said, “Why are you fighting?”

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:47.400
“It’s nice to fight, you know.”

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.560
But why are you fighting they don’t know.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.960
The reason – there is no love.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.080
So everything that you see you detest,

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.840
“I don’t like it, I don’t like it,” detest everything.

00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.480
You try, out of your frustration,

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:04.040
to destroy anything that you see.

00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:07.080
So a new trend started.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.160
Apart from the war, when it was over,

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.480
naturally the value system dropped out.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.160
People felt, “What’s the use, you see,

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.400
we had all these values, so what did we get?

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:19.880
War and war, what is the war,

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.160
for war has just killed all our societies,

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.400
they have killed our children, everybody

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:28.160
and what is the great about this war also?”

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:32.080
So the mind of the people on the whole was that,

00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:40.160
you see, somehow or other, you must fight.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:44.160
Like the fittest man is the best,

00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.400
so the one who can dominate,

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.040
the one who can come up is the best.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:54.640
So the domination of this imperial style

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:57.240
of government was over,

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:03.240
but individually it became a process of domination.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:07.320
And with this process of domination ego started developing.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.720
Even to children they used to give a education

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.240
in such a way that children became very arrogant.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.960
Very artificial, extremely arrogant and artificial.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.720
It was impossible to understand

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.880
why these children were not at all controlled,

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.960
were told that “This is wrong.”

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:31.960
Because the parents also took a very, very defensive attitude.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:36.360
They would not face their children

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.560
and tell them what is wrong.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.120
They were so attached to that idea

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.800
that these children will leave us,

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:49.040
that they said, “All right, do what you like, but stay with us.”

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:56.240
Under these circumstances even human beings as such

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:01.720
were dwindling between a good family life

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.800
and divorces and a funny society,

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.600
which believes in sharing women or sharing men

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.560
and all kinds of things.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:19.040
So what a terrible situation was there for Adi Shakti

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:22.400
to assert Herself.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.480
Then also there was very big problem

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:30.400
about these religions asserting themselves,

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.480
their own ideas, their own conditionings on people

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:38.080
and absolutely blinding them.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.640
So it was a turmoil,

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:45.880
it was a turmoil and at this turmoil-state only,

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:51.720
Adi Shakti had to come to establish the dharma.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:57.200
She had to work it out to establish the dharma.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:03.400
It was a very shifty place, very shifty sands were there.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:08.560
But when I was born, I was shocked the way people were.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:12.160
At that time, I don’t think I met many seekers.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.960
Of course, I met one or two realized souls,

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:19.160
but mostly they were worried about their insurance,

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.760
their money, their this, that.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.280
Mean if you talked to them, I mean, not know

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:27.800
where have you come, into some wilderness or what?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.800
You didn’t know what to talk to them.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:32.960
How could you start telling them about divine Love,

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.960
when they were not seekers even.

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.040
Then, gradually,

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.720
I felt confident.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.400
First I thought I have come little early,

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.560
I should have waited slightly more,

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.880
would have been better,

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:53.320
because here the people hate everyone,

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:56.720
and every individual is against another individual,

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.320
and they are cheating each other

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.080
and they are also very jealous of each other

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.560
and also want to have higher positions and this and that.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:08.720
Or others, they want to pull everybody’s legs.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.080
So, maybe that there’s no yet time

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.040
for Sahaja Yoga to start.

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:20.960
But then I saw all these horrible false gurus also

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.640
throwing their own charms on people,

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.760
and trying to control them.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.160
That made Me really, really think

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:36.880
that now I better stop worrying as to what the atmosphere is,

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.960
worrying as to what sort of people there are

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.800
let’s start.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:45.720
And that’s how the first Brahmarandra Chhedan

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:52.720
took place in India. That’s 5th May.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:59.040
And – 1970, 5th May, in the morning time,

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:01.720
of course it had some, also some events

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:05.320
which made Me hurry up to do it.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:09.400
I was quite ready, I knew what was the problem of human beings is,

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:17.240
but I thought that, maybe, they may never accept

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:23.040
that they can get their Self-realization.

00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:30.640
Now this incarnation is really a very unique type.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.240
So many incarnations came.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.800
They came, told you everything, like words,

00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:38.880
and said this is good, this is good, this is good.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:42.720
Some people, who were enamored by them, followed them.

00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:46.240
But nothing was inside their heart,

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.400
whatever they heard, all right,

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:54.160
it’s a sermon, it’s a lecture, it’s a Gita, that’s all.

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:57.640
And the life of such a person

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:02.040
didn’t have that spark of the divine Love

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.160
within that person.

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.640
We have had lots of good people

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.240
during this short time if you see.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.240
If you see, Mahatma Gandhi was there,

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.960
Martin Luther was there.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:19.160
All kinds of people you see all over,

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:23.080
Abraham Lincoln was there, George Washington was there.

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:27.640
We have … William Blake was there, we had Shakespeare.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:32.640
All this, this time, you see, in the literature, in every way

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:38.720
Lao Tse, then we had Socrates.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.560
Start from Socrates to today,

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:46.560
we have had lots of philosophers, lots of people,

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:50.040
who talked about higher life.

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.880
Despite that,

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:57.720
people were thinking these are some absurd people,

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.440
there’s nothing in it, too much to understand.

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:06.560
Nobody would read anything about, say, Guru Gita,

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.240
they would not.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.880
They would think that “What’s this nonsense,

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:15.160
what’s the use, is all humbug going on,” like that.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:20.240
With this attitude, you see, you find all around,

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:24.040
when I looked, “Oh,” I said, “Wah, how am I to tell them,

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.280
what you are, what they are, and what they have to find?”

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:33.640
And it was really My desire

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:38.480
that there should be some keeness in people,

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:42.720
just little bit, if they gave Me a little chance,

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:48.400
this divine Love is so subtle,

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.640
it will just penetrate into their hearts.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:55.560
But they would not, they were just like stones.

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.800
You couldn’t talk to them; you couldn’t tell them about anything.

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:02.800
And they thought no end of themselves, that’s the worst part of it.

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:07.640
Under these circumstances Sahaja Yoga started.

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:15.240
And there I find that the powers of Adi Shakti

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:19.920
are much greater than the problems, you see.

00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:23.480
I saw it very clearly Myself,

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:32.160
because these powers are awakening the kundalini.

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:36.640
I knew I can awaken the kundalini, no doubt, I knew that.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.960
And also knew that I can do it en-masse, realization.

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:44.720
But I could never think that people whom I awakened

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.120
will come back, again, because,

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:49.800
you see, they are ignorant people.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.160
I never thought that they’ll come back,

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:55.080
they’ll practice Sahaja Yoga or they’ll go to this level.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.040
Never, never, never, never thought.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.640
If somebody had told Me I would have laughed at that person.

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:05.080
Exactly what happened was that when I gave the first lecture,

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:08.040
anywhere, that hall would be finished,

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:10.800
everything would be finished, and nothing to do with that hall,

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.080
I was staying somewhere else, it was …

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:16.760
the hall was taken on hire,

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:21.560
and follow-on, of course, very few.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:26.160
So I thought that, you see, doesn’t go into their heads,

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.600
just goes over their head, I think.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.960
They don’t want to understand anything.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.320
They did not understand anything.

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:38.320
Under the great pressure, you see

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:40.720
I had the family problems, this, that.

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:44.160
That was not so important. The most important thing was,

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:50.480
that how to penetrate into human mind.

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:54.880
So the only solution was to raise their own kundalini;

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:59.520
to create that little light in them.

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.800
Because if I go on, sitting down

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.320
with the idea that they’ll come around and ask Me

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:05.880
for kundalini awakening and

00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:09.200
then I will awaken them – was a wrong idea.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.160
I could realize that.

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.560
So en-masse realization started.

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:21.160
And this really surprised people.

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.960
It was no magic,

00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.320
it was not story telling, but it was the truth.

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.840
They could feel it on their fingertips,

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.880
they could feel it

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:34.160
out of their fontanelle bone area.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:38.320
It’s the actualization of Sahaja Yoga

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.880
has worked the wonders.

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:44.480
Otherwise, it would have been impossible.

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:47.400
All these wonders that you see today

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:51.720
are because your – your reaction,

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:55.480
because the way you reacted, the way you received it.

00:46:55.640 --> 00:47:00.280
Otherwise, Adi Shakti is what? Good for nothing.

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:06.280
If you do not accept, I’m nothing.

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:15.240
Actually, it is again, I say, your wisdom,

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:21.800
your sense, your – your seeking

00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:24.160
has brought you to Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.960
I never write letters to anybody,

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:29.160
I never call anybody, that you know all gurus do that,

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.960
as soon as they go to any city,

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:34.160
they write it down the names of all the important people

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.320
and then they send them letters,

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.960
and get about two, three at least for such programs.

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.240
But without doing all that, you see,

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:49.960
how we have managed this en-masse kundalini awakening,

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:55.720
by which people started understanding Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.480
It started penetrating into them.

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:04.400
Now for that, I have to raise My own Kundalini like that.

00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:08.640
Every time, in a public program, I raise Mine also.

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:14.240
And in My Kundalini, itself I catch all your problems.

00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.320
It’s painful; that’s why after puja

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:20.800
I become very, sort of … like a stone, I should say, for a while.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:24.160
Reason is I’m absorbing all that is within you.

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.640
Like I’ve put you all in My body.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:31.720
You are parts and parcel of My body.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:37.080
Every cell that I have, is for you, for your abode.

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.480
And you have to be that subtle

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:44.640
to understand that if we own something,

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:51.800
or if we have something to be done about Sahaja Yoga or anything,

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:55.040
if we want to start an ashram, or anything,

00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:57.840
immediately I know.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:03.080
How do I know is because you are inside Me.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:07.960
Most of the things I know very clearly.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:12.560
But some of these things I don’t know that clearly

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.880
because of one thing.

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.720
The relationship between you and Me

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.160
is of course very intimate,

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.800
that you should be in My body,

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:36.240
but if you people are not meditating

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:41.400
is very mundane thing I must tell you – Dhyanagamya

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.640
if you are not meditating,

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:48.160
then I have no relationship with you.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:51.040
You are not My relation.

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.960
You have no right on Me.

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.880
You have no question to be asked,

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:59.240
why this is happening, why that is happening.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:05.480
So if you do not meditate, I always say meditate, meditate

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.080
I have nothing to do with you and

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:11.640
no more there for Me.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:15.800
It has no connection with Me,

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.880
then you are like all other people.

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:19.320
You may be Sahaja yogis,

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.480
you might have got your Sahaja Yoga degree

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:26.040
from your leaders maybe, I don’t know,

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:29.720
and maybe that you are regarded as something very great.

00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:34.200
But, if you do not do your meditation

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.640
every day, evening morning or evening

00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:45.240
you will be really not anymore in the realm of Shri Mataji.

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:50.320
Because the connection is only through gyana,

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.800
through meditation.

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:56.160
I have known people who do not do meditation.

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.480
Then they suffer, their children suffer, then something happens;

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.400
then they start coming and telling Me.

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:04.400
But I see clearly that the person is not meditating,

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.640
I have no relationship with him.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:10.440
He has no right to ask Me anything.

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:15.800
In the beginning of course, the meditation takes some time.

00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.160
But once you will know what is meditation is,

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:22.640
how you enjoy My company, how you are one with Me,

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:26.480
how we can have a rapport with each other.

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:30.320
There’s no need to have anything else in between,

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:35.240
like writing letters or maybe some sort

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.400
of a special connection, nothing of the kind!

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:41.720
Only thing that is needed is the meditation.

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:45.160
In meditation you grow.

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:48.400
In that spiritually you become higher.

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:54.320
And when that happens, you start,

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:56.960
in a way, I would say

00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:02.640
that when you reach a state of

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:09.560
that, I should say, maturity in Sahaja Yoga,

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.560
then you don’t want to give up your meditation.

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:16.760
Because that time, you are absolutely one with Me.

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:20.720
That doesn’t mean for three hours, four hours you should do meditation.

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:25.800
But it is how much intensely you are with Me is important;

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:31.400
now it is not how much time you are with Me.

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:33.720
Then I’m responsible for you,

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.560
for your children, for everyone.

00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:40.480
I am responsible for your ascent, for your protection,

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:45.240
to save you from all your negativity.

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:48.520
So it’s not like a father

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:51.640
who will directly punish you,

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.640
it’s not that, but it’s just

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:59.400
“All right, you are not My relation, I am out.”

00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.160
That’s the only thing that can happen.

00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:04.560
If you are not meditating, all right,

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:08.160
I cannot force you, I have nothing to do with you.

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.640
You may have other relationship, outside, outward.

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:16.160
But this inner relationship, by which you get your benevolence,

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:20.480
you cannot have without meditation.

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:23.080
I’ve been telling all of you, please meditate,

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:25.400
please meditate every day.

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:29.240
But I think people are also not understanding

00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:31.800
the importance of what I am saying,

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:36.240
because they tell Me, “Mother, we don’t meditate.”

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.240
“Why?”

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:41.640
“Now we are realized soul, so why should we meditate?”

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.560
Now this instrument is fully made,

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.400
but if it is not all the time connected for the mains,

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:52.080
what’s the use of having it.

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:56.240
In that meditation, you will feel the Love,

00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:59.240
the divine Love, the beauty of that divine Love,

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:03.800
a complete panorama changes.

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:07.400
A meditative person has a very different attitude,

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:09.560
a very different temperament,

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:13.080
a very different life and he lives always

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:17.160
in complete satisfaction with himself.

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:22.960
So today as being the first day, as you say,

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:27.400
of the Advent, say, we can say that it is the first day

00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:31.320
when the Advent took place, as we are worshipping today

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:36.040
of course it was not today, but still we can say that if that is so.

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:43.040
If it has happened and it has been helpful to you,

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:47.400
it has been a great blessing to you,

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:50.080
then must know how to preserve it,

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.320
must know how to enhance it,

00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.800
must know how to enjoy it.

00:54:56.040 --> 00:55:01.840
You should not just get satisfied with one, or can say,

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:06.240
one last drama, or one this thing, one that

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:11.640
But you should have a full oneness

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.080
with the Divine, full oneness.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:17.640
And that is possible only if you really meditate,

00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:22.520
which is quite a easy thing to do, to meditate is.

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.800
Some people say, Mother, we cannot get over time,

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:29.400
we cannot think … we are all the time thinking something,

00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:35.240
or that time we want to see the watch.

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.400
In the beginning we may have a little problem,

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:40.960
I’m not saying, you may not have, you may have,

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:42.960
but that’s only in the beginning.

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:47.240
But gradually you will be all right.

00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:50.800
Gradually you will master it.

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:54.040
Gradually you will know it so well

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:57.400
that you would not like to have anything else

00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:01.040
of a cheaper type, you wouldn’t care for such a thing.

00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:05.880
You see, so to get to your beauty,

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:10.400
to get to your glory, to get to your own great personality

00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:13.040
which is now exposed,

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:16.480
only thing you have to do really religiously

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.080
is to meditate.

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:23.320
That’s not that “Tonight I came very late so I need not meditate.

00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.800
Tomorrow, you see, I have to go for work

00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.320
so I cannot meditate.”

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:33.160
Nobody wants to know the excuses. It’s between you and yourself.

00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:37.320
It is your gain, nobody else’s.

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:42.040
It’s for your gain everything is happening.

00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:46.560
Now one has to know

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:51.240
that we have achieved a certain height of evolution.

00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:55.800
And from this height you might go up to here, up to here,

00:56:55.960 --> 00:57:00.400
up to here. I’m not saying it’s not possible to do that.

00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:05.320
But, first and foremost thing, that whatever you may be,

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:09.240
may consider you to be a very high-class Sahaja yogi,

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:14.120
you have to be humble about meditation.

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.720
This meditative quality …

00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:22.720
even when I’m talking to you, it’s just, I am getting into it,

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.240
because it’s so joy-giving.

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.400
You just jump into the ocean of joy.

00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:30.400
First, it will be difficult,

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:35.320
but after some time you will know that this connection

00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:38.160
that you have with Shri Mataji

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:44.840
is the only connection that you were looking out for.

00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:51.640
And also there is another point people get lost with,

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:54.160
which I have seen very common

00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:59.000
with some people who get lost.

00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:03.640
They meditate individually, very much, it is very correct.

00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:06.240
Individually they will meditate.

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:10.880
And they will sit down, meditate, we do puja, we do …

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:14.800
But collectively they will not meditate.

00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:17.680
So this is another point one has to remember,

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:21.560
that you have to be collectively meditating.

00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:25.600
Because I am a Collective Being of all you.

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:29.880
And when you meditate collectively, you are really very close to Me.

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.640
So even if you have a program or something,

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:35.480
you must do some meditation with it.

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:41.720
Always have meditation as the priority for any program.

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:47.560
You sing the songs, is over, everything is done, then you meditate.

00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.160
If I’m insisting on something,

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:54.800
you must know that this must be the truth I’m telling you,

00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:57.160
absolutely the basis of it,

00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:03.840
though it looks rather mundane, but it’s very important.

00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:12.640
Now for us to worship Adi Shakti,

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:18.680
I don’t know, or, because there has been no,

00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:24.880
no prayers or anything about Adi Shakti.

00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:27.640
Up to Bhagawati they have gone,

00:59:27.880 --> 00:59:30.840
but beyond Bhagawati they have not gone.

00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.800
So I don’t know what sort of pujas you will have,

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:40.240
but let’s try something, maybe.

00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:43.800
I think the meditation is the best way

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.800
we can really achieve something,

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:51.440
so we can go into meditation for about five minutes.

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:42.360
Please close your eyes.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:55.320
Eleven Rudras are awakened

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:59.480
and they will destroy all that is negative.
