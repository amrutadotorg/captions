WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:06.320
Before we begin, I would like to introduce myself

00:06.530 --> 00:08.650
to those of you in the room.

00:08.850 --> 00:12.590
My name is Barbara Schuler and I do a radio program

00:12.790 --> 00:16.820
on a station from Monterrey called Discovery

00:17.020 --> 00:21.450
which is usually on Wednesdays from 1 to 2:30,

00:21.650 --> 00:26.210
and is going to be now on Thursdays to 11:30 to 1 o’clock.

00:26.450 --> 00:28.890
And it’s my privilege to be here

00:29.090 --> 00:32.450
to do a taped interview for my listeners.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.360
So for the listeners I would like to say

00:37.560 --> 00:40.610
that we are at Kennolyn Campgrounds in Santa Cruz

00:40.810 --> 00:44.530
and this is an interview with Her Holiness Mataji.

00:45.010 --> 00:49.650
Mother, today there are many, many things said about Sahaja Yoga,

00:49.890 --> 00:51.490
about Your philosophy

00:51.690 --> 00:55.600
and very little was said about who You are as a person.

00:56.250 --> 00:58.650
And I thought it would be good to start out with some,

00:58.850 --> 01:02.250
few questions about who You are, who were You as a child,

01:02.450 --> 01:04.290
what people influenced You,

01:04.490 --> 01:06.850
what brought You to the place You are today

01:07.050 --> 01:11.210
as a Luminous Being sitting before me and before us?

01:11.690 --> 01:15.690
I am a very ancient being – that problem is like this, you see?

01:18.450 --> 01:21.690
And to… what can I tell you about Myself?

01:21.890 --> 01:24.930
I just don’t know what part will interest you,

01:25.720 --> 01:30.210
but only thing I can say

01:30.650 --> 01:36.160
that I was born with this understanding and awareness

01:36.370 --> 01:40.290
that I have to find out a method

01:40.930 --> 01:45.170
by which I could give en mass Realization to people.

01:45.770 --> 01:47.220
I was a Realized soul, of course.

01:47.430 --> 01:51.050
I knew all about it from My very childhood.

01:51.280 --> 01:56.720
But the problem was that how to make many people get it,

01:56.920 --> 01:59.240
because if one person gets it

01:59.450 --> 02:01.490
or one person has it,

02:01.690 --> 02:03.850
if one person is an incarnation,

02:04.050 --> 02:06.330
people don’t understand it.

02:06.530 --> 02:10.600
Not only that but they may even try to destroy such a person.

02:10.810 --> 02:13.650
That’s what happened to all the saints who came on this earth.

02:13.850 --> 02:15.650
Christ was crucified,

02:15.850 --> 02:17.830
Mohammed Sahib was given poison.

02:18.030 --> 02:19.800
Because they were ignorant.

02:20.010 --> 02:23.650
They did not know what it was, what was He saying.

02:24.370 --> 02:26.710
So it was important first of all

02:26.910 --> 02:30.920
to find out a method how to give them

02:31.130 --> 02:34.090
en mass Realization.

02:34.570 --> 02:38.030
And from that angle I just thought

02:38.230 --> 02:40.670
that this is why I am on this earth

02:40.880 --> 02:43.160
and I have to do this job,

02:43.370 --> 02:47.090
for which I wanted to study about human beings.

02:47.490 --> 02:50.650
I took My birth in a Christian family

02:50.890 --> 02:54.450
and that too a family which was Protestant family,

02:54.650 --> 02:57.610
because I felt that

02:58.610 --> 03:01.930
Protestants are fanatics but very sophisticated.

03:05.490 --> 03:08.130
And they rationalize everything to such an extent

03:08.330 --> 03:10.450
that nobody can see beyond it.

03:10.650 --> 03:13.650
So I better take My birth in them.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.760
And My father and mother had already taken birth

03:16.970 --> 03:19.730
whom I had chosen as My parents.

03:20.010 --> 03:23.330
They were great people, realized souls

03:23.530 --> 03:25.770
and specially My father

03:25.970 --> 03:28.970
was a person who knew why I was on this earth.

03:29.210 --> 03:32.090
Even My mother knew about it.

03:33.170 --> 03:37.160
So a special rapport was between them and Me

03:37.370 --> 03:39.730
and they could understand

03:39.940 --> 03:43.400
why I was busy meditating

03:43.600 --> 03:48.050
or finding out about how to give Realization to others.

03:48.330 --> 03:51.290
Then I would say My father who was a very learned man,

03:51.570 --> 03:53.770
who knew about fourteen languages,

03:53.970 --> 03:56.450
who translated Quran-e-Sharif into Hindi,

03:56.690 --> 03:59.570
who was a member of the Constituent Assembly,

03:59.770 --> 04:01.280
He made our Constitution.

04:01.480 --> 04:06.170
Also he was the only Christian to be elected in those days.

04:06.490 --> 04:10.530
And then My mother was a honors in Mathematics,

04:10.730 --> 04:14.810
all very well-educated and nice people.

04:15.090 --> 04:17.170
They dedicated their life

04:17.370 --> 04:20.170
to the cause of freedom of India.

04:20.410 --> 04:23.130
And I also felt that, that was very important,

04:23.330 --> 04:25.970
because if we are not free

04:26.210 --> 04:28.690
we cannot do anything on religious basis.

04:28.890 --> 04:31.970
There’s one thing is to be free from this level.

04:32.210 --> 04:37.090
And that’s how I also helped them a lot

04:37.290 --> 04:39.320
and our whole family suffered a lot.

04:39.520 --> 04:42.380
And I went through terrible times, terrible times,

04:42.580 --> 04:44.080
since very young age.

04:44.290 --> 04:46.140
I was with Mahatma Gandhi also

04:46.340 --> 04:48.550
because he liked Me very much as a child.

04:48.750 --> 04:49.980
So I stayed on with him

04:50.180 --> 04:53.160
then I used to come back to study, again go back to him.

04:53.370 --> 04:54.850
He used to call Me “Nepali”

04:55.050 --> 04:57.490
because My face is a Nepali face.

04:57.970 --> 04:59.330
And he used to talk to Me

04:59.530 --> 05:01.570
as if he is talking to his grandmother sometimes.

05:01.770 --> 05:04.370
He was very sweet and he was a very sweet man

05:04.570 --> 05:06.810
– extremely sweet person to children -

05:07.050 --> 05:11.410
very strict with himself and strict with others elderly people.

05:11.610 --> 05:16.210
But with children he was very, very sweet and kind

05:17.330 --> 05:21.210
and would try to learn from children lot of things.

05:21.410 --> 05:23.490
It was surprising how he understood

05:23.690 --> 05:26.970
that there’s lot of wisdom with the children sometimes

05:27.170 --> 05:31.810
than with the older people who are mixed up.

05:33.970 --> 05:36.920
Now we got our independence

05:37.130 --> 05:40.320
and we had a very bad setback

05:40.520 --> 05:45.010
because of the partition we had in our country.

05:45.770 --> 05:48.890
And I was studying in Lahore Medical College there

05:49.090 --> 05:51.770
because I wanted to know about medicine

05:51.970 --> 05:54.870
what these people call such and such thing,

05:55.070 --> 05:57.610
because I knew all this but, I knew about the body,

05:57.810 --> 06:00.090
I knew about everything, the

06:00.370 --> 06:02.930
what you call the complete nervous system

06:03.130 --> 06:06.010
but I did not know what was the vocabulary attached to it,

06:06.210 --> 06:08.120
so I studied there for two years.

06:08.330 --> 06:10.770
Now after that, this war broke out,

06:10.970 --> 06:13.090
so I had to discontinue with My studies

06:13.290 --> 06:15.570
and My parents wanted Me to get married.

06:15.770 --> 06:19.720
And then I found that My marriage was important,

06:19.920 --> 06:21.130
I agreed to marry

06:21.330 --> 06:25.030
and I married this gentleman, Mr. C.P. Srivastava.

06:25.330 --> 06:28.240
Then during all that time,

06:28.440 --> 06:33.190
My only pastime or the full-time work

06:33.390 --> 06:35.210
was to find out about human beings,

06:35.410 --> 06:37.090
what’s the problem they have,

06:37.290 --> 06:40.690
how they avoid reality,

06:40.970 --> 06:43.570
how they shun it, how they run away from it,

06:43.770 --> 06:45.490
what are their problems,

06:45.690 --> 06:50.840
how are they seeking, what do they have to offer,

06:51.050 --> 06:53.490
what will they accept, how to handle them.

06:53.690 --> 06:55.250
It was quite a intricate question.

06:55.450 --> 06:59.570
Every person provided a new sample of problems

06:59.770 --> 07:01.500
and I had to fight it out.

07:01.700 --> 07:05.880
In a way that it was a system which I knew how to do it,

07:06.080 --> 07:09.280
because to enter into somebody subtly,

07:09.480 --> 07:11.810
to understand the problems of the Kundalini –

07:12.010 --> 07:16.770
you can go into the journey and find out about a person.

07:17.090 --> 07:18.190
And then I found out

07:18.390 --> 07:21.690
the permutations and combinations of their problems.

07:21.890 --> 07:25.290
So like, it is like, you can say, that, like periodic tables.

07:25.490 --> 07:28.690
You had to divide them into three, then into seven,

07:28.890 --> 07:30.970
then into their permutations and combinations.

07:31.210 --> 07:34.570
So you can imagine - three into seven, raised to power eternity.

07:34.810 --> 07:35.990
It was like that.

07:36.190 --> 07:39.690
But doesn’t matter! It worked out and

07:41.050 --> 07:45.800
in the year 1970,

07:46.000 --> 07:48.200
on the 5th of May,

07:48.410 --> 07:51.930
I was little bit hesitant at that time.

07:52.130 --> 07:54.550
I thought I should wait but certain circumstances

07:54.750 --> 07:59.640
made Me to open the last center.

07:59.890 --> 08:02.840
And when I opened the last center,

08:03.370 --> 08:06.970
it started working with others, it went on en mass scale.

08:07.210 --> 08:10.570
But still I gave Realization only to

08:10.810 --> 08:12.730
one lady who came to My house.

08:12.970 --> 08:15.890
I tried if it works out with her.

08:16.090 --> 08:18.660
And she, I gave her Realization,

08:18.860 --> 08:22.060
by touching her centers one by one

08:22.260 --> 08:23.400
- six centers -

08:23.610 --> 08:26.290
and then bringing out the Kundalini on top of the head.

08:26.490 --> 08:30.010
- What does it mean to open the last center?
- The Sahasrara?

08:30.210 --> 08:34.130
Last center is the center which is the limbic area;

08:35.370 --> 08:38.050
where is the seat of all the seven centers.

08:38.290 --> 08:39.930
It’s all integration there.

08:40.130 --> 08:42.010
So far, everybody who has come

08:42.210 --> 08:43.810
- like Christ has come on this center,

08:44.010 --> 08:45.690
what you call the Agnya Chakra,

08:45.890 --> 08:49.320
or Krishna has come on this center which is the Vishuddhi Chakra.

08:49.530 --> 08:54.240
Like that they have been appearing on every center of ours

08:54.450 --> 08:57.530
giving us a new dimension to our awareness.

08:57.770 --> 09:01.330
And that’s how our awareness has improved to this extent

09:01.520 --> 09:05.680
and now the time is for you to get your Absolute,

09:05.890 --> 09:09.080
to get your Spirit,

09:09.290 --> 09:13.130
that your Spirit must shine into your attention,

09:13.370 --> 09:18.890
that you should have your Self-Realization,

09:19.090 --> 09:21.370
that you should have your second birth.

09:21.610 --> 09:25.610
That’s the time! And that is only possible if baptism,

09:25.810 --> 09:28.930
the real baptism works out – real, not artificial,

09:29.130 --> 09:31.930
somebody coming and putting the hand on your head and saying,

09:32.130 --> 09:34.410
“Now you are baptized”.  That’s not the way.

09:34.610 --> 09:37.590
But it is a real thing that happens that you start feeling

09:37.800 --> 09:41.010
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of you.

09:42.180 --> 09:47.130
So then I started giving first of all Realization

09:47.330 --> 09:50.690
without confronting any kind of a position or anything.

09:50.890 --> 09:54.530
I started with one lady, then I went ahead with it.

09:54.730 --> 09:57.450
Then the first twelve people got Realization.

09:57.650 --> 09:58.930
Then I was very happy

09:59.130 --> 10:01.810
because en mass Realization has started.

10:02.090 --> 10:04.850
Then gradually it started working out.

10:05.050 --> 10:07.210
I went to Indian villages.

10:07.410 --> 10:09.090
I thought they are better, simple people,

10:09.290 --> 10:12.410
first work on the simpler people. And they got Realization.

10:12.610 --> 10:15.490
Now we have thousands of people in the villages

10:15.730 --> 10:17.410
who have got Realization.

10:17.610 --> 10:19.450
They have dropped out all their bad habits.

10:19.650 --> 10:21.490
They have become very creative.

10:21.690 --> 10:24.610
They are doing very well. They are very happy people.

10:24.810 --> 10:26.090
And they are experts.

10:26.290 --> 10:29.320
So many of them are experts I can say in India now,

10:29.520 --> 10:31.120
whom we call as Sahaja Yogi,

10:31.330 --> 10:32.770
may be in thousands.

10:32.970 --> 10:34.520
Some are working in the villages,

10:34.720 --> 10:36.560
some are working in some cities.

10:36.770 --> 10:40.450
So we have lots of people now in India, who can do this job.

10:40.650 --> 10:43.160
This all happened since 1970?

10:43.360 --> 10:45.480
- I started it.
- [So You started]...

10:45.690 --> 10:49.370
I have a question that’s important to me

10:49.600 --> 10:54.520
and to many people who are searching for something as they think,

10:54.720 --> 10:57.010
perhaps what you call Self Realization

10:57.210 --> 11:00.570
or Sahaja Yoga or something.

11:00.770 --> 11:03.070
We, some of us don’t know exactly what it is.

11:03.270 --> 11:05.920
And we find that there are many teachers.

11:06.130 --> 11:08.850
How do we recognize those teachers

11:09.050 --> 11:12.290
that You might call fraudulent from the real ones?

11:12.490 --> 11:15.730
It’s so difficult because they all seem to be able to

11:15.930 --> 11:18.730
inspire us in certain ways and give us experiences.

11:18.970 --> 11:22.930
How do we know who is teaching something that’s true

11:23.130 --> 11:25.490
and who is being deceptive?

11:25.690 --> 11:27.250
First and foremost thing is:

11:27.450 --> 11:31.850
anybody who lives on your earnings is not a guru.

11:32.610 --> 11:37.050
A guru will never live on the earnings of his disciples.

11:37.370 --> 11:39.890
But here there are people who have big palaces,

11:40.130 --> 11:43.650
bought aircrafts and cars and this.

11:43.850 --> 11:45.710
I mean, this is something one should understand.

11:45.910 --> 11:50.570
It’s so, so open to you to understand.

11:50.770 --> 11:55.680
I mean, I cannot understand more obvious thing that this one is

11:55.880 --> 11:57.410
that it’s a parasitic living.

11:57.610 --> 12:00.210
And you cannot have a parasites as your gurus.

12:00.410 --> 12:02.890
They can be parasites but not your gurus.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.850
That’s one of the things. And if you can…

12:06.970 --> 12:09.490
I mean, you can retain some people, you know?

12:09.690 --> 12:12.330
If you want because you are rich people, you can retain some.

12:12.530 --> 12:15.330
That’s a different point. But you cannot have them as gurus.

12:15.530 --> 12:18.640
Guru has to be a higher personality, you see?

12:18.850 --> 12:23.330
Now you have seen Christ was such a great incarnation.

12:23.600 --> 12:25.530
He didn’t take any money from anyone.

12:25.730 --> 12:29.070
He was a carpenter’s son and He used to do carpentry Himself

12:29.270 --> 12:30.970
and He lived like a modest man.

12:31.170 --> 12:35.270
He never lived with big cars and big houses. It’s not necessary

12:35.470 --> 12:39.150
because such a person is Himself, He is a very big king, you see,

12:39.350 --> 12:41.410
like a big emperor.

12:41.650 --> 12:44.280
He doesn’t need anything, an emperor doesn’t need anything

12:44.480 --> 12:47.230
because nothing can give him comfort

12:47.430 --> 12:50.050
except that He Himself is in complete comfort.

12:50.290 --> 12:52.490
So such a person doesn’t want anything.

12:52.690 --> 12:56.890
So you must see that such a person has no needs of comfort at all.

12:57.130 --> 13:00.730
He can sleep on the grounds, he can sleep anywhere.

13:00.930 --> 13:02.810
Now, in this life,

13:03.010 --> 13:06.250
I should say I come from a quite a wealthy family

13:06.450 --> 13:09.700
or married to another wealthy man, you can say that way,

13:09.900 --> 13:12.770
according to your own relative ideas.

13:12.970 --> 13:16.130
But to Me,

13:16.330 --> 13:18.450
I can sleep anywhere. I have no problem.

13:18.650 --> 13:19.930
I have no problem of food,

13:20.130 --> 13:22.770
no problem of sleeping anywhere, no comfort.

13:22.970 --> 13:26.450
And I find it is beyond My self-respect

13:26.650 --> 13:29.330
to live on the earnings of others. It’s not proper.

13:29.530 --> 13:30.700
But you are My children;

13:30.900 --> 13:34.190
supposing now you bring a flower to Me or something, it’s all right.

13:34.390 --> 13:37.870
But I can’t have a palace out of your money and all those things.

13:38.070 --> 13:39.650
It’s absurd, absolutely absurd!

13:39.850 --> 13:43.650
So this is one thing one should know that it pampers our ego,

13:43.850 --> 13:45.930
that we can purchase our guru,

13:46.130 --> 13:48.250
we can purchase our Self-Realization.

13:48.450 --> 13:51.530
You see, this is a very subtle pampering.

13:51.770 --> 13:53.570
And that’s how people accept, you see?

13:53.770 --> 13:57.050
They don’t want to accept a person who says,

13:57.290 --> 13:59.850
“You cannot offer anything.”  It’s too much for them.

14:00.090 --> 14:04.660
Or maybe that, secondly, could be that people think

14:04.860 --> 14:08.640
that if you pay something then you get attached to it,

14:08.840 --> 14:10.540
you go through it whatever it is.

14:10.740 --> 14:12.940
Say you have paid for a ticket

14:13.150 --> 14:15.990
and you find that the whole play is horrid, you can’t bear it,

14:16.190 --> 14:18.580
but you have to go through it because you have paid for it.

14:18.780 --> 14:20.160
That’s a human nature, you see?

14:20.370 --> 14:22.530
That’s a human nature. I have seen that they do it.

14:22.730 --> 14:24.530
And that’s what it works out.

14:24.730 --> 14:26.850
But this is very gross level, I’m telling you.

14:27.050 --> 14:30.820
But another should be that in these modern times it is promised

14:31.020 --> 14:33.490
that you will become prophets.

14:34.410 --> 14:36.250
You have to become prophets.

14:36.450 --> 14:39.850
So you must see have you become prophets out of these?

14:40.050 --> 14:43.690
Is... easiest is to see the disciples of this man,

14:43.890 --> 14:45.890
any XYZ who says he is a guru.

14:46.130 --> 14:49.330
Now what is happening to the disciple? Is he a free person?

14:49.570 --> 14:51.330
Has he got any knowledge?

14:51.530 --> 14:53.370
Has he got any mastery?

14:53.610 --> 14:55.550
What has he achieved by being with that person?

14:55.750 --> 14:57.650
Now, you have seen here there are Sahaja Yogis.

14:57.860 --> 14:58.930
One better than the other!

14:59.140 --> 15:01.730
You talk to them, they are knowledge.

15:02.910 --> 15:05.690
Some of them have met Me only for, say, eight day or so.

15:05.890 --> 15:07.320
They have become knowledge.

15:07.530 --> 15:09.290
So what have they achieved you should say.

15:09.490 --> 15:13.290
What is their style of life, their pattern of life, how they behave?

15:13.490 --> 15:15.840
And there cannot be any privacy about it,

15:16.040 --> 15:17.290
you see, like mafia -

15:17.490 --> 15:19.770
you don’t tell that and you don’t say that

15:19.970 --> 15:21.170
and you shouldn’t do that.

15:21.370 --> 15:23.330
Of course, in Sahaja Yoga

15:23.730 --> 15:26.290
the truth is exposed gradually,

15:26.490 --> 15:30.270
but it is not like this that if you give some money, nobody knows.

15:30.470 --> 15:32.990
Everybody knows everything in Sahaja Yoga, you see?

15:33.190 --> 15:36.990
Now supposing we have to build an ashram, say for example.

15:37.190 --> 15:39.490
All right, you build your ashram, you collect your money,

15:39.690 --> 15:42.320
do what you like and know about it. I have nothing to do with it.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.850
Also among yourself you should know how you got the money,

15:45.050 --> 15:47.730
how you spent it, what is the expense and all that.

15:47.930 --> 15:50.510
Because ashram you can pay for

15:50.710 --> 15:53.130
but not for your Realization.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.760
And this is one thing is very important,

15:56.970 --> 15:59.410
that what you get out of it is important,

15:59.610 --> 16:02.250
that you should become a prophet.

16:02.810 --> 16:05.010
Have you become a prophet?

16:05.250 --> 16:08.490
Then, thirdly, you must know that if
you are going from one to another,

16:08.690 --> 16:10.130
what we call guru shopping business

16:10.370 --> 16:11.770
that means you have not found it.

16:11.970 --> 16:13.770
Otherwise, you would just settle down.

16:13.970 --> 16:17.170
But some people are so weak that they do settle down with one

16:17.370 --> 16:19.210
and are finished with them.

16:19.490 --> 16:21.130
You must always see the people

16:21.330 --> 16:24.080
who go to these gurus, what have they got.

16:24.290 --> 16:27.690
Have they got their transformation?

16:28.830 --> 16:31.690
Because this is the age of transformation.

16:31.890 --> 16:36.090
Mataji, what about teachers or gurus who produce miracles?

16:36.290 --> 16:38.450
You go to a guru

16:38.650 --> 16:41.720
who materialize something out of the air and say, “This is divine”.

16:41.930 --> 16:43.310
That’s a very serious question.

16:43.510 --> 16:45.000
This is all jugglery. It’s all jugglery.

16:45.210 --> 16:47.610
And also, you see, now supposing somebody says,

16:47.810 --> 16:49.410
“I produce a diamond”.

16:49.610 --> 16:51.050
Now these people come from India.

16:51.250 --> 16:55.130
Why don’t they solve the financial problem of India?

16:59.890 --> 17:02.840
Secondly, you see, at every point they can be challenged.

17:03.050 --> 17:04.850
You should say that, "Then, all right"...

17:05.050 --> 17:07.610
One gentleman came to Me; he said that, “He gave me a diamond.”

17:07.820 --> 17:09.620
I said, “Why you? How many diamonds you have?”

17:09.820 --> 17:11.860
He has said, “Hundreds.” Then I said, “Why did he give you?

17:12.060 --> 17:14.530
He should give to your driver who hasn’t got a diamond”.

17:14.730 --> 17:17.970
You see, that is what it is. So it is all jugglery.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.930
You should see those who materialize,

17:21.210 --> 17:23.050
what have they given you?

17:23.250 --> 17:25.530
They have to give you something eternal.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.170
If they talk about God,

17:27.370 --> 17:28.930
God is not going to give you diamond.

17:29.130 --> 17:30.970
Which God has given diamonds to people?

17:31.170 --> 17:34.410
Have you heard of anyone giving diamonds? No!

17:35.610 --> 17:39.410
So you should ask for something which is the highest,

17:39.610 --> 17:41.650
which is the supreme most.

17:41.890 --> 17:45.410
Now the fourth thing, which is very important,

17:46.050 --> 17:48.850
that whatever experiences you get -

17:49.050 --> 17:51.450
for example, some people start just like jumping,

17:51.690 --> 17:54.810
some start shouting, some start behaving like animals.

17:55.010 --> 17:57.250
And they say, “Oh, that’s what is coming out.

17:57.450 --> 17:58.610
You are taking out, you see.”

17:58.810 --> 18:02.010
They feel very bad, they get horrible diseases,

18:02.210 --> 18:04.650
they get into troubles and they get into pains

18:04.850 --> 18:06.850
and all sorts of things and contortions.

18:07.050 --> 18:09.370
They say, “Now, your subconscious is coming out”.

18:09.570 --> 18:12.730
Nothing has to be brought out. That’s one thing you must know.

18:12.930 --> 18:15.810
The subconscious, as I told you, is on the left hand side

18:16.010 --> 18:18.490
and the supraconscious on the right hand side.

18:18.690 --> 18:23.210
What you have to do is to ascend in the center and come up.

18:23.410 --> 18:26.240
Above your head is the super-consciousness

18:26.450 --> 18:28.210
and when you become that,

18:28.410 --> 18:31.050
then you develop collective consciousness.

18:31.250 --> 18:35.010
So those who want you to become like frogs again,

18:35.250 --> 18:39.090
you must know that you are not going to become frogs anymore.

18:39.450 --> 18:42.090
That’s not anyway evolution.

18:42.290 --> 18:44.930
The evolution has to go higher,

18:45.130 --> 18:48.010
not becoming frogs or earthworms, you see?

18:48.210 --> 18:51.570
And if you start crawling, it is simple mesmerism.

18:51.770 --> 18:54.850
Anybody mesmerizes can do these tricks, you see?

18:55.050 --> 18:56.410
It’s simple mesmerism.

18:56.610 --> 18:59.800
And then to believe that now you are surrendered and all that

19:00.000 --> 19:01.530
is all nonsense, you see?

19:01.730 --> 19:05.050
It has no meaning to Realization.

19:05.290 --> 19:07.690
In Realization, you just become the master.

19:07.890 --> 19:09.850
You become the master of it.

19:10.050 --> 19:13.090
There are many people in this country who came

19:13.490 --> 19:16.170
and lured you by their talks also,

19:16.370 --> 19:21.450
talking big about Brahma, Atmatattva, this, that and everything.

19:21.650 --> 19:22.930
That is not the way you can,

19:23.130 --> 19:26.150
that is what is just the pendulum moving

19:26.350 --> 19:29.010
from Christian sermon to Hindu sermon

19:29.220 --> 19:31.680
and from Hindu sermon to Islamic sermon,

19:31.880 --> 19:33.960
from there to the Rabbi sermon.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.930
You see, it goes on like that, you see? That’s not the way.

19:37.130 --> 19:39.250
You have to rise higher within yourself.

19:39.450 --> 19:41.730
And that’s why those who lecture about these things

19:41.930 --> 19:44.770
are really sometimes can be very, very dangerous.

19:44.970 --> 19:48.330
And so many have died of cancer, this, that.

19:48.530 --> 19:51.210
I don’t know what to say that people who go to these people

19:51.410 --> 19:54.330
get into very bad troubles and suffer so much.

19:54.530 --> 19:56.850
And then on top of that when all this happens,

19:57.050 --> 19:59.250
they say, “You must suffer.”

20:00.450 --> 20:02.290
That’s a very good excuse, “You must suffer”.

20:02.490 --> 20:04.130
You must pay to suffer.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.970
Pay money to suffer.

20:07.810 --> 20:09.450
And then people go on suffering.

20:09.650 --> 20:13.010
Now one thing I have to tell you that Christ has suffered for us.

20:13.210 --> 20:14.810
We don’t have to suffer anymore.

20:15.010 --> 20:18.410
Those who deny His sufferings, will have to go for suffering.

20:18.610 --> 20:21.170
All right, have it! But He suffered for us.

20:21.370 --> 20:23.850
There is no need for us to suffer anymore.

20:24.090 --> 20:26.010
When He is awakened within us,

20:26.210 --> 20:29.370
He takes away all that is our ego means our karmas,

20:29.570 --> 20:33.090
our superego, that is our conditioning, completely removed,

20:33.290 --> 20:35.490
and you become one with the Divine.

20:35.690 --> 20:37.930
There is no need for anybody to suffer

20:38.130 --> 20:40.850
and this idea of suffering is all nonsensical.

20:41.050 --> 20:43.850
You should not suffer at all.

20:44.330 --> 20:46.210
Good!

20:47.290 --> 20:49.130
I’m glad it’s over.

20:52.920 --> 20:55.520
- Mataji, You are called “Mother”.
- Yes.

20:55.770 --> 20:57.810
It seems that in Hindu tradition

20:58.010 --> 21:02.710
there is a special context or meaning of the word “Mother”.

21:02.910 --> 21:04.250
What is this meaning?

21:04.450 --> 21:08.640
You see, in the Indian philosophy,

21:08.840 --> 21:11.320
even in the Christian philosophy it is so,

21:11.520 --> 21:13.890
but it has been little bit changed -

21:14.090 --> 21:16.690
if you read the books of Essenes, you will find

21:16.890 --> 21:18.610
that they have described the “Mother”,

21:18.810 --> 21:20.490
you see, the Holy Ghost is the Mother.

21:20.690 --> 21:22.930
When they say about the Holy Ghost, She is the Mother.

21:23.130 --> 21:25.470
But how can you have… You must reason it out.

21:25.690 --> 21:27.970
How can you have a Father and a Son without a Mother?

21:28.170 --> 21:30.530
It’s a, you see, simple thing like that.

21:30.730 --> 21:34.130
You see, so it’s the Mother only. Holy Ghost is very important.

21:34.330 --> 21:35.800
So Holy Ghost is the Mother.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.500
You see, it's an absurd thing, I mean, to have such a thing.

21:38.700 --> 21:40.970
Even homosexuals cannot have children.

21:41.170 --> 21:43.290
It’s funny thing, isn’t it? Absolutely absurd!

21:43.490 --> 21:45.970
But Christians accepted this, I don’t know why.

21:46.170 --> 21:47.970
Why didn’t they go into, find out

21:48.170 --> 21:49.850
what is this Holy Ghost business is?

21:50.050 --> 21:52.530
They said, “It’s a mystery”. How can you say it’s a mystery?

21:52.770 --> 21:55.890
When you cannot explain then better not say anything about it.

21:56.090 --> 21:58.090
So Holy Ghost is something hanging in the air.

21:58.290 --> 21:59.970
No one knows; it’s a mystery

22:00.170 --> 22:02.850
and the rest of it is the Father and the Son. It’s absurd!

22:03.050 --> 22:07.840
Now the principle of Mother is in every, every Scripture,

22:08.040 --> 22:09.330
has to be there.

22:09.530 --> 22:11.930
Now the Mother’s character is that

22:12.130 --> 22:15.730
She is the One Who is the Womb,

22:16.250 --> 22:18.650
She is the One Who is the Mother Earth

22:18.890 --> 22:21.210
and She is the One Who nourishes you.

22:21.410 --> 22:23.530
She nourishes us, you know that.

22:23.730 --> 22:28.010
And this feminine thing in every human being

22:28.210 --> 22:30.490
resides as this Kundalini as you have seen.

22:30.690 --> 22:33.970
And when She rises, She gives you this new awareness

22:34.210 --> 22:37.450
which becomes compassion, which is flowing,

22:37.650 --> 22:45.360
which becomes soothing, nourishing energy of love.

22:45.570 --> 22:48.010
And that’s what today people are saying feminist -

22:48.210 --> 22:50.250
all this thing and all that. That’s again a pendulum

22:50.450 --> 22:52.530
- a man becoming a woman, woman becoming man -

22:52.730 --> 22:54.970
all these problems you have had because of this.

22:55.170 --> 22:58.840
But when you move spirally upward,

22:59.050 --> 23:01.850
then where do you move you become

23:02.090 --> 23:07.290
a personality full of compassion, of love,

23:07.570 --> 23:11.130
of universal understanding,

23:11.570 --> 23:13.490
through collective consciousness.

23:13.690 --> 23:15.850
And then you rise up to a position

23:16.050 --> 23:18.680
where you become universally conscious.

23:18.890 --> 23:20.940
So that is what should happen to you.

23:21.140 --> 23:24.010
And if that happens, then we should say

23:24.210 --> 23:27.650
that your motherly qualities within you have risen.

23:27.930 --> 23:30.210
And that’s what we have so far neglected.

23:30.450 --> 23:33.730
You do not become a woman but you become motherly.

23:34.050 --> 23:38.650
First the Father, then the Son and now the Mother! All right?

23:38.850 --> 23:41.930
What is the role of woman in this world,

23:42.130 --> 23:44.370
the role of the feminine principle?

23:45.170 --> 23:47.300
I would say, I don’t say that women

23:47.500 --> 23:50.130
as women who are born as women only have the role,

23:50.330 --> 23:52.390
even the men have, everyone has,

23:52.590 --> 23:54.760
because everyone has Kundalini within them.

23:54.970 --> 23:57.570
But the women must know that if they are women,

23:57.770 --> 23:59.970
they have a greater responsibility.

24:00.210 --> 24:02.930
Not that they should sit at home and only look after children

24:03.130 --> 24:06.770
and brood and then nag the husbands when they come home.

24:09.190 --> 24:10.610
That’s not their role.

24:10.810 --> 24:15.050
The role is such that they have to be forbearing.

24:15.290 --> 24:17.570
Any person who is the mother

24:17.770 --> 24:20.090
has to be like the Mother Earth.

24:20.290 --> 24:23.050
How much She is forbearing! How much She suffers!

24:23.290 --> 24:26.730
We dig Her out, we torture Her life

24:26.930 --> 24:29.210
still She is giving all the time;

24:29.410 --> 24:32.370
She is soothing, forgiving, bearing it out, you see.

24:32.690 --> 24:34.650
Then we are doing so many sinful things,

24:34.850 --> 24:37.610
I mean, She should explode real with anger, the way it is.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.930
But She does not, She is very careful,

24:40.130 --> 24:41.770
She slowly, slowly informs that,

24:42.010 --> 24:45.280
“Now get out of this place, it’s rumbling”.

24:45.490 --> 24:48.570
She is so kind, you see? That all should come to us.

24:48.770 --> 24:50.890
So it’s not that it is only the women

24:51.090 --> 24:53.090
who should settle down with these qualities,

24:53.290 --> 24:55.810
but the time has come that men have to have these qualities.

24:56.010 --> 24:58.130
Otherwise, there will be always an imbalance.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.360
So now the men have to become

25:00.560 --> 25:04.050
extremely kind, affectionate, compassionate.

25:04.250 --> 25:06.250
Give up that competitive spirit,

25:06.450 --> 25:08.970
that fighting spirit like Napoleon had.

25:09.210 --> 25:10.970
All those ideas are outdated.

25:11.170 --> 25:14.610
Now whom do you respect? People like Mahatma Gandhi

25:14.930 --> 25:16.890
or Abraham Lincoln.

25:17.250 --> 25:21.170
Everyone...an American should think of Abraham Lincoln.

25:21.370 --> 25:23.650
Yes, indeed.

25:24.250 --> 25:26.250
Mother, what are we doing here?

25:26.450 --> 25:28.210
What is the purpose of life on earth?

25:28.450 --> 25:32.050
What are human beings walking around on this planet for?

25:32.490 --> 25:34.090
You are specially made by God.

25:34.290 --> 25:37.590
You are specially chosen by God to be human beings

25:37.790 --> 25:40.330
and you are here with a very great purpose.

25:40.530 --> 25:42.260
The first purpose of God

25:42.460 --> 25:47.010
is that you should become the vehicle of God’s powers,

25:47.210 --> 25:48.390
completely.

25:48.590 --> 25:50.690
So that He flows through you,

25:50.890 --> 25:54.850
He flows into this atmosphere,

25:55.050 --> 25:57.810
into this universe, to make it a divine place.

25:58.010 --> 26:00.850
If you, when you get Realization, what happens?

26:01.050 --> 26:04.130
These – all your abnormalities drop out

26:04.330 --> 26:06.490
and you become very normal person

26:06.690 --> 26:10.090
and these vibrations of cool breeze start flowing.

26:10.290 --> 26:12.450
With this now you can give it to Mother Earth,

26:12.650 --> 26:15.050
you can give it to the plants, you can give it to the trees.

26:15.250 --> 26:19.770
The whole thing becomes a “Garden of Allah”,

26:19.970 --> 26:22.690
where you reside in complete joy and happiness.

26:22.890 --> 26:24.430
The second purpose is,

26:24.630 --> 26:26.700
that God has prepared you now,

26:26.900 --> 26:28.760
to settle into His Kingdom.

26:28.970 --> 26:32.450
That’s your throne. That’s your right to be there.

26:32.690 --> 26:34.330
It could have been short circuited

26:34.530 --> 26:37.570
at a time when Adam and Eve were called

26:37.770 --> 26:41.810
and told not to go into this so-called “book of knowledge”

26:42.010 --> 26:43.810
or the “fruit of knowledge”.

26:44.010 --> 26:45.210
But they didn’t listen.

26:45.410 --> 26:47.870
You see, f you give freedom to someone then, “What’s wrong?”

26:48.070 --> 26:51.450
So they started doing things which were brought to them

26:51.690 --> 26:54.130
by a satanic force and they accepted it.

26:54.370 --> 26:56.690
So that was the original sin we have committed.

26:56.890 --> 26:59.770
So they had to take incarnations, do all those things

26:59.970 --> 27:01.930
and now brought it to this level

27:02.130 --> 27:06.080
where human beings have to be brought again back

27:06.280 --> 27:09.050
to the position where they were to go.

27:10.650 --> 27:13.570
Mother, what is the true nature of death?

27:13.770 --> 27:16.450
Is it possible that you can choose not to die?

27:16.650 --> 27:18.760
What’s the purpose of death?

27:18.970 --> 27:22.480
You see, death is just like changing your clothes.

27:22.690 --> 27:26.530
So sometimes when you use too much of your clothes, get tired,

27:26.730 --> 27:28.830
you want to change it. Like that death is.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.310
Nobody dies, there’s nothing that dies

27:31.510 --> 27:34.080
except that the part that is the Mother Earth

27:34.280 --> 27:38.230
and the part that is the water falls off

27:38.430 --> 27:40.160
and you remain as you are.

27:40.370 --> 27:42.730
But if you are a realized soul, then you have a choice.

27:42.930 --> 27:45.880
If you want to be born again, you would like to reborn.

27:46.080 --> 27:48.640
If you don’t want to be born, you will not be born.

27:48.850 --> 27:52.410
But after Realization, it becomes your choice.

27:52.610 --> 27:54.250
If you want to die, you can die.

27:54.450 --> 27:57.150
If you don’t want to die, you need not die.

27:57.650 --> 28:00.650
But you want, because you think that,

28:02.130 --> 28:06.410
“Let us die and come back as new people

28:06.610 --> 28:08.610
again to help Mother.”

28:09.810 --> 28:12.810
Many of us have heard discussions or read in books

28:13.010 --> 28:17.370
about the evolution of matter, the evolution of the substance.

28:18.170 --> 28:21.170
What are Your views on evolving matter

28:21.370 --> 28:24.210
and how does this relate to our own physical matter

28:24.450 --> 28:26.290
in our bodies or cells?

28:26.490 --> 28:29.330
So the matter did go into evolution, you know that,

28:29.530 --> 28:31.890
and when the carbon was established,

28:32.090 --> 28:34.010
actually our first chakra was established.

28:34.210 --> 28:36.610
That’s carbon which is tetravalent and

28:36.810 --> 28:39.930
carbon is the one which started producing amino acids.

28:40.130 --> 28:45.090
You see, when amino acid started manifesting itself this...

28:45.290 --> 28:49.440
then the other processes took place by which the evolution

28:49.650 --> 28:54.690
of, say from amoeba to human stage took place.

28:54.890 --> 28:58.450
That also we understand very well after getting Realization,

28:58.690 --> 29:01.770
how we became from amoeba to human stage;

29:01.970 --> 29:07.770
and after human stage we have to achieve our Self Realization,

29:07.970 --> 29:11.500
means the Spirit which is in our heart,

29:11.700 --> 29:13.810
has to manifest in our attention,

29:14.010 --> 29:16.610
or we have to feel it on central nervous system.

29:16.810 --> 29:19.810
But what is the relationship between matter and this?

29:20.010 --> 29:22.130
We should see that point. It’s important.

29:22.330 --> 29:25.610
Now through the matter all our centers are made.

29:25.810 --> 29:28.230
For example, the two centers that are down below

29:28.430 --> 29:31.770
are made of the Mother Earth principle.

29:31.970 --> 29:34.650
And then another one and another one like that.

29:34.890 --> 29:39.210
All these elements have contributed to make the centers.

29:39.450 --> 29:42.410
And these centers are just like mirrors made

29:42.610 --> 29:46.250
and the reflection of the Divine falls on them.

29:46.450 --> 29:50.490
Then at a human level the matter improves so much,

29:50.690 --> 29:52.940
goes into such evolutionary processes,

29:53.150 --> 29:57.410
that the reflection at the heart level improves so much

29:57.610 --> 29:59.200
that the Spirit shines there,

29:59.400 --> 30:04.170
and the Kundalini is properly set for your evolution,

30:04.410 --> 30:06.250
which is the epitome of evolution.

30:06.450 --> 30:09.090
Like this instrument that is made one by one,

30:09.290 --> 30:11.370
first collecting this part, that part, that part,

30:11.570 --> 30:12.640
then put together.

30:12.840 --> 30:15.850
Now the time has come for you to be put to the mains.

30:16.050 --> 30:18.930
Now this has nothing to do with the electricity, if you see.

30:19.170 --> 30:22.370
It exists without electricity but it can carry the electricity.

30:22.570 --> 30:24.490
In the same way, we become the lamp,

30:24.690 --> 30:27.730
and when we become the lamp the light can be brought in

30:27.930 --> 30:29.610
and we become enlightened.

30:29.810 --> 30:34.130
So there is a big relationship between the lamp and the light.

30:34.330 --> 30:37.290
But light cannot exist without the lamp,

30:37.490 --> 30:39.680
so lamp has to be there.

30:39.890 --> 30:42.090
Mother, can I ask you a question about sex?

30:42.290 --> 30:44.290
Yes, please.

30:46.410 --> 30:49.910
It was stated today that sex has nothing to do with evolution

30:50.110 --> 30:52.080
the way it’s been described in Sahaja Yoga.

30:52.290 --> 30:53.690
What does this mean?

30:53.890 --> 30:57.130
You see the thing is that we think that by doing sex

30:57.330 --> 30:59.370
or by going into sex we can evolve.

30:59.570 --> 31:01.130
It’s absolutely falsehood.

31:01.330 --> 31:05.570
You have not become a human being from amoeba to this stage

31:05.770 --> 31:06.840
by doing sex.

31:07.040 --> 31:09.450
Because animals all do sex, everybody does sex.

31:09.650 --> 31:11.730
If they do it or not, makes no difference!

31:11.930 --> 31:14.780
The thing is the evolution takes place

31:14.980 --> 31:16.280
only through your seeking.

31:16.480 --> 31:20.730
When you start seeking something, then only you evolve.

31:20.930 --> 31:22.860
And the seeking first was for food,

31:23.060 --> 31:24.880
if you see in the animals was for food, you see.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.330
Sex was spontaneous.

31:26.530 --> 31:28.770
They don’t think about it; they don’t read about it;

31:28.970 --> 31:31.370
they don’t have any education about it – nothing.

31:31.570 --> 31:34.610
Sex comes all spontaneously, just like your breathing, you see.

31:34.810 --> 31:37.680
You don’t have to have as you have in your schools now teaching sex.

31:37.880 --> 31:39.890
What is there to teach I don’t understand, I mean.

31:40.090 --> 31:41.560
It is such a spontaneous thing.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.130
On the contrary, the more you talk about it,

31:43.330 --> 31:44.610
the worse it becomes, you see.

31:44.810 --> 31:47.490
And the more it becomes a brain thing,

31:47.690 --> 31:49.810
you cannot do sex with your brain, you see.

31:50.050 --> 31:51.730
So it’s all a nonsensical thing.

31:51.930 --> 31:54.690
All these things have added to your problems

31:54.890 --> 31:57.370
of impotency and all sorts of things in this country.

31:57.570 --> 31:58.950
Too much thinking about sex,

31:59.150 --> 32:01.150
at the time of sex you are nowhere, you are lost.

32:01.350 --> 32:03.770
So what’s the use of such a life, you see?

32:03.970 --> 32:06.250
So the people who think about sex too much

32:06.450 --> 32:10.360
are really very unnatural people, they are very unnatural.

32:10.570 --> 32:12.810
To be natural is to keep it spontaneous,

32:13.010 --> 32:14.570
to live very spontaneously.

32:14.770 --> 32:17.790
Of course, as an Indian lady, it is too much to speak on details

32:17.990 --> 32:20.050
but I would say that…

32:23.280 --> 32:27.240
And we are not supposed to even say the word “sex” in Indian life,

32:27.450 --> 32:29.050
you see, it’s like that, you see?

32:29.290 --> 32:31.890
But I think we are very potent people.

32:32.090 --> 32:34.790
The amount of children we are producing, you can never produce

32:34.990 --> 32:36.410
even if you want to.

32:46.490 --> 32:49.840
So now the thing is that

32:50.050 --> 32:54.130
as a Mother I give all sort of grace to these people,

32:54.330 --> 32:56.210
grace marks I should say,

32:56.410 --> 32:59.610
when they said that the sex can take you to Kundalini,

32:59.850 --> 33:01.690
because you know, in the beginning

33:01.890 --> 33:04.090
they must have tried something like that

33:04.290 --> 33:07.290
and they must have seen

33:07.490 --> 33:12.300
the expression of the deity

33:12.500 --> 33:14.800
which has got a trunk, you see,

33:15.010 --> 33:16.750
which is settled on this center.

33:16.950 --> 33:18.150
We call it as Ganapati

33:18.350 --> 33:22.560
who actually incarnated as Christ on this earth, later on.

33:22.770 --> 33:26.330
But He is the Ganapati. And there you see just a trunk

33:26.530 --> 33:28.140
and they must have misunderstood

33:28.340 --> 33:29.780
that this trunk is the Kundalini,

33:29.980 --> 33:31.890
because it has a shape like that.

33:32.090 --> 33:33.810
And that’s why they might have said it,

33:34.010 --> 33:36.080
but it’s the most dangerous thing.

33:36.290 --> 33:37.480
If you go through sex,

33:37.680 --> 33:41.970
then you are open yourself absolutely to hell.

33:42.170 --> 33:45.650
If you go towards sex and try to come to God,

33:45.890 --> 33:47.930
it’s absolutely wrong, you see?

33:48.130 --> 33:51.370
Christ has gone to such a limit because Christ was born here

33:51.570 --> 33:54.210
and He looks after our all optic lobes

33:54.410 --> 33:56.370
and all this part of the eyes.

33:56.570 --> 33:58.130
And what He said,

33:58.330 --> 34:01.290
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

34:01.490 --> 34:03.130
Just see it!

34:03.970 --> 34:07.170
What does that mean? That means you have innocent eyes.

34:07.370 --> 34:10.490
He was innocence. He was the embodiment of innocence.

34:10.690 --> 34:12.570
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”

34:12.770 --> 34:15.170
No lust and no greed in your eyes.

34:15.370 --> 34:18.210
Now is only possible if Christ is awakened within you.

34:18.410 --> 34:20.010
Once He is awakened within you,

34:20.210 --> 34:22.090
then you will have your innocence

34:22.290 --> 34:25.410
and you will also lose the lust from your eyes.

34:25.610 --> 34:28.330
Eyes will be absolutely looking

34:28.530 --> 34:30.450
but not getting involved.

34:30.650 --> 34:32.690
That sort of a thing will happen to you.

34:32.890 --> 34:36.410
So the sex which is a normal thing to do

34:36.610 --> 34:39.810
has to be sanctified by collective people,

34:40.010 --> 34:41.660
should be done in a proper way

34:41.860 --> 34:43.400
so that you get good children.

34:43.610 --> 34:46.610
The marriage should be sanctified collectively

34:46.810 --> 34:49.050
and should be done in a proper way

34:49.250 --> 34:50.700
and should be looked after.

34:50.900 --> 34:53.920
Because now, of course people are on a different line,

34:54.130 --> 34:56.770
but when I had come ten years back, when I told them,

34:56.970 --> 34:59.250
that you have to have sanity about sex,

34:59.450 --> 35:01.930
they were very angry and they said, “You are Victorian”.

35:02.130 --> 35:05.130
They called Me “Queen Victoria”.

35:06.490 --> 35:08.620
But now I think they have learnt a lesson

35:08.820 --> 35:11.400
because I had told them, I had told them

35:11.600 --> 35:14.850
that, “You will get a disease which you will not be able to work on.

35:15.130 --> 35:18.610
Don’t do all this nonsense of perversion. It’s very nonsensical.”

35:18.810 --> 35:20.530
But even now they are trying to evade the issue.

35:20.770 --> 35:22.130
Don’t try to evade the issue.

35:22.330 --> 35:24.050
You can be cured of that disease

35:24.290 --> 35:27.770
if you can awaken your innocence within yourself.

35:28.250 --> 35:31.680
Through the grace of Christ only you can do it.

35:31.890 --> 35:35.530
Mother, we have learned, heard that when,

35:35.730 --> 35:39.490
when we learn love then we shall have will.

35:39.690 --> 35:43.290
What is the relationship between love and will?

35:44.010 --> 35:47.930
When we’ll have love, then we’ll have will.

35:48.290 --> 35:51.930
Good! Love is when you become the Spirit,

35:52.130 --> 35:54.370
because Spirit is nothing but God’s love.

35:54.610 --> 35:57.290
This All Pervading Power is Spirit.

35:57.490 --> 36:02.090
So when you know that love, which is not attachment,

36:02.370 --> 36:03.670
it’s not attachment, you see.

36:03.880 --> 36:07.520
Like a sap rises in the tree,

36:07.730 --> 36:11.730
it goes even to the trunk,

36:11.930 --> 36:14.170
and then to the branches, to the leaves,

36:14.370 --> 36:16.330
to the flowers, to everyone.

36:16.530 --> 36:18.410
It doesn’t settle down into one flower.

36:18.610 --> 36:22.370
If it does, then the flower dies and the tree also dies.

36:22.570 --> 36:26.090
So it is not attached, but it is nourishing.

36:26.290 --> 36:29.330
It does what it has to do. That kind of a love,

36:29.530 --> 36:33.890
which is absolutely without any conditions, unconditional,

36:34.090 --> 36:37.090
without any lust, without any greed - that kind of a love -

36:37.290 --> 36:38.300
when you will know,

36:38.500 --> 36:42.450
that is only possible when you will become the Spirit.

36:42.650 --> 36:44.850
Then you will know the Will of God,

36:45.050 --> 36:47.130
the Will of God – what is to be done.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.640
Because you don’t know. Now you have to...

36:49.840 --> 36:52.360
Then when you get your Realization what happens?

36:52.570 --> 36:55.690
This cool breeze is like a computer working.

36:55.890 --> 36:59.490
You ask the computer, “Now, should I do this work?”

36:59.690 --> 37:01.930
If it is yes, you will have cool vibrations.

37:02.130 --> 37:05.890
If not, no vibrations. So you will know His Will.

37:06.130 --> 37:08.850
"Thy Will be done", you see? How do you know His Will?

37:09.050 --> 37:11.450
Then you just know. You become the knowledge.

37:11.650 --> 37:14.570
When you become the knowledge, when you become the love,

37:14.770 --> 37:16.240
then you become the knowledge also.

37:16.440 --> 37:17.800
Even in everyday life,

37:18.000 --> 37:21.530
if you love somebody, you know a lot about that person.

37:22.810 --> 37:25.370
Mother, this afternoon You said something very interesting

37:25.570 --> 37:28.170
in response to a question by a woman.

37:28.370 --> 37:30.570
And response You gave was that

37:30.770 --> 37:35.410
“Service and sacrifice are a myth, or is a myth.”

37:35.890 --> 37:37.810
Can you describe what You meant by that?

37:38.010 --> 37:41.170
You see, when I said that, when you become a saint,

37:41.370 --> 37:43.490
in the sense when you become a realized soul,

37:43.690 --> 37:45.890
you find that you are collectively conscious.

37:46.090 --> 37:49.850
Then what happens, that if somebody has got a problem

37:50.050 --> 37:51.970
you feel it on your fingertips.

37:52.170 --> 37:55.370
Now you rub your fingertips and the person feels all right.

37:55.650 --> 37:58.490
Now you have done no service, you have done no sacrifice.

37:58.690 --> 38:00.490
It’s your finger that is in trouble.

38:00.690 --> 38:03.170
Now if you rub your finger, who is the other?

38:03.370 --> 38:05.850
You see this comes out of ignorance and those…

38:06.090 --> 38:08.340
In India actually, they knew it so well

38:08.540 --> 38:11.840
that those people who talked of sacrifice and service

38:12.040 --> 38:15.290
were called as Shudras, means untouchables.

38:15.530 --> 38:17.490
That means they had no knowledge about it.

38:17.690 --> 38:20.090
Those people who talked that, “We’ll serve you;

38:20.290 --> 38:22.940
we’ll do this dirty work of yours, that dirty work of yours” -

38:23.140 --> 38:24.340
they were called as Shudras.

38:24.540 --> 38:26.610
They are not the people who should be touched

38:26.810 --> 38:28.370
because they have no awareness

38:28.610 --> 38:33.110
that the All Pervading Power of God is there

38:33.310 --> 38:34.610
which does everything.

38:34.810 --> 38:36.890
What you have to do is to just become one with It.

38:37.090 --> 38:39.730
And once you are one with the whole Primordial Being,

38:39.970 --> 38:42.850
say, on your body if there is a pain somewhere,

38:43.050 --> 38:45.690
you just rub it. All right, you rub it and it’s all right.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.250
There’s no obligation on it.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.010
In anyway you have not served anyone,

38:49.210 --> 38:50.450
you have not obliged anyone.

38:50.650 --> 38:55.170
So the concept that you are one with the Whole itself

38:55.370 --> 38:57.090
is the noble’s concept.

38:57.290 --> 38:59.250
And those people who do not have that concept

38:59.450 --> 39:00.740
cannot understand. They think,

39:00.940 --> 39:03.650
“We are serving others; we are looking after others.”

39:03.850 --> 39:06.940
“Who is the other?” I asked them. “Who is the other?”

39:08.530 --> 39:10.610
That is why this is the concept

39:10.810 --> 39:12.450
with which Indians have always lived.

39:12.650 --> 39:14.170
And that’s something good they have.

39:14.370 --> 39:16.040
But they also picked up, you see,

39:16.240 --> 39:17.730
when your missionaries went there

39:17.930 --> 39:20.170
they also started their missions, this, that,

39:20.380 --> 39:22.320
serving and serving and all that.

39:22.530 --> 39:25.450
Now to the poor people, now how do we serve?

39:26.050 --> 39:27.930
We serve in this way in Sahaja Yoga

39:28.130 --> 39:29.950
that once they get their Realization

39:30.150 --> 39:31.760
they don’t remain so poor at all.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.290
You see, because first of all

39:33.490 --> 39:35.850
the poor people have bad habits of drinking;

39:36.050 --> 39:37.410
all those things drop out.

39:37.610 --> 39:41.050
So all that money doesn’t go into nonsensical thing.

39:41.650 --> 39:44.010
Secondly, they get those vibrations.

39:44.210 --> 39:48.290
Now whatever work they are in, they become dynamic.

39:48.610 --> 39:50.010
They have no health problem.

39:50.210 --> 39:52.450
They don’t have to go to the doctors.

39:52.650 --> 39:54.050
They become healthy people.

39:54.290 --> 39:56.090
Mentally they are so alert

39:56.290 --> 39:58.010
that they do better than any other.

39:58.210 --> 40:01.330
We have seen people who came to Me and said that,

40:01.530 --> 40:03.850
“Our children are very bad at school.

40:04.050 --> 40:05.130
Must do something about them.”

40:05.330 --> 40:07.210
When they got their Realization, now they stood first.

40:07.410 --> 40:09.290
They got all the scholarships, everything.

40:09.490 --> 40:10.580
They are doing so well.

40:10.780 --> 40:14.290
So, such people become also materially better off.

40:14.490 --> 40:17.090
They don’t become extraordinarily rich

40:17.290 --> 40:20.930
but they become materially well-off, satisfied people.

40:21.130 --> 40:23.890
You see, also dissatisfaction is another poverty,

40:24.130 --> 40:25.290
because you are dissatisfied.

40:25.530 --> 40:27.250
I think those are the greatest poor people

40:27.450 --> 40:28.980
because they are never satisfied.

40:29.180 --> 40:35.010
But the people who are realized souls, are satisfied souls.

40:35.210 --> 40:38.010
They know how to live well and they are helped.

40:38.210 --> 40:41.210
Like Krishna has said it, “Yoga kshema Vahamyaham”.

40:41.450 --> 40:44.570
He said, “I’ll give you Kshema after Yoga.”

40:44.770 --> 40:48.650
First He said “Yog.” And “Kshema” means your well-being.

40:48.850 --> 40:52.450
So well-being acts after Yoga, not before.

40:55.410 --> 40:57.510
Mother, in the West there is a great,

40:57.710 --> 41:00.850
especially I would say in this part of the West from the West Coast,

41:01.050 --> 41:05.490
there is a great interest in subjects such as Kabbalah,

41:05.690 --> 41:10.330
tarot, astrology, spiritual alchemy.

41:10.550 --> 41:14.240
How does Sahaja Yoga relate to this? What are Your views about this?

41:14.440 --> 41:16.450
I can’t understand. That means they are not seekers

41:16.650 --> 41:17.970
those who have such interest, you see,

41:18.170 --> 41:20.690
because these things relate to a material life.

41:20.890 --> 41:22.530
Mataji, how do they relate to a material life?

41:22.730 --> 41:25.650
You see, because Kabbalah will tell you when will you get married,

41:25.850 --> 41:28.170
or how much money you’ll have, what race you’ll win,

41:28.370 --> 41:29.410
all those things, you see?

41:29.610 --> 41:31.250
God has no interest in these things, you see.

41:31.450 --> 41:34.570
All these things are, spiritual alchemy,

41:34.770 --> 41:37.870
how will you change this into gold...

41:38.070 --> 41:39.310
And what does it matter?

41:39.510 --> 41:42.480
Gold and all those things what are so important, isn’t it?

41:42.690 --> 41:47.690
The most important thing is to be your Spirit.

41:47.970 --> 41:50.580
And those who are seeking the Spirit are real seekers.

41:50.780 --> 41:53.410
All others are seeking money

41:53.610 --> 41:55.130
in some other form, you see,

41:55.330 --> 41:57.150
and then when they go to these people actually

41:57.360 --> 41:58.450
these are nothing but spirits -

41:58.650 --> 42:00.130
and they get possessed by spirits

42:00.330 --> 42:02.210
and they have horrible time, you see.

42:02.450 --> 42:04.170
One should never indulge into these things.

42:04.370 --> 42:07.560
Christ has warned the most of all and we are doing it.

42:07.770 --> 42:09.930
So often it’s very wrong to ask

42:10.130 --> 42:11.690
for anything material like that.

42:11.890 --> 42:14.050
Why should we have easy money like that?

42:14.250 --> 42:15.610
It’s not good I think,

42:15.810 --> 42:17.610
through some spirit helping you or something.

42:17.810 --> 42:19.290
I don’t know if it really helps.

42:19.490 --> 42:22.050
It may little bit help but give you later trouble.

42:22.250 --> 42:26.490
Like one lady had a problem with her husband, you see?

42:26.690 --> 42:30.450
She said that, “He is a bad man; he’s a flirt and all that.”

42:30.650 --> 42:32.890
She went to such a woman and he became

42:33.090 --> 42:35.090
as far as she is concerned, he gave up flirting

42:35.290 --> 42:36.450
but he started racing.

42:36.650 --> 42:39.910
And he got lost in racing. Then she went there and she said that,

42:40.110 --> 42:43.280
“Now he should be all right from this, He should get out.”

42:43.480 --> 42:44.770
So he started drinking.

42:44.970 --> 42:47.780
And after some time he started doing all the three things, you see.

42:47.980 --> 42:49.760
So it was too much.

42:49.960 --> 42:52.620
So this kind of a nonsense you should not indulge into

42:52.820 --> 42:53.890
if you are seekers.

42:54.090 --> 42:56.210
But there are category of people who are seekers.

42:56.450 --> 42:59.460
That’s what I feel. And those who are seekers are getting into it

42:59.660 --> 43:02.730
should get out of it and get to your Spirit.

43:03.030 --> 43:05.180
What’s the role of the artist

43:05.390 --> 43:08.310
- in this work, this Sahaja Yoga?
- Who?

43:08.510 --> 43:11.730
An artist, artistic work like music…

43:11.930 --> 43:13.920
Oh, great, great! Tremendous it is!

43:14.120 --> 43:16.810
You see, those people who have been realized souls

43:17.010 --> 43:19.130
have created eternal art.

43:19.410 --> 43:23.010
Like we can say, Michelangelo was a realized soul.

43:23.210 --> 43:25.210
So his work is eternal art.

43:25.410 --> 43:28.010
They produce art which creates vibrations.

43:28.210 --> 43:29.850
You can feel vibrations from him.

43:30.050 --> 43:33.160
In the whole church if you go you feel horrid,

43:33.360 --> 43:36.000
but when you go to Sistine Chapel and see his work

43:36.210 --> 43:38.330
and the whole thing fills you up with vibrations.

43:38.530 --> 43:40.890
They are creators of vibrations. Imagine!

43:41.090 --> 43:42.650
The musicians like Mozart...

43:42.850 --> 43:45.930
Mozart creates vibrations but Wagner…

43:49.530 --> 43:53.170
You see, so they are the people who are realized souls.

43:53.370 --> 43:57.050
You have some tennis players who are realized souls also

43:57.250 --> 43:58.450
- perhaps you don't know.
- Tennis players?

43:58.650 --> 44:01.330
Yes! McEnroe is a realized soul

44:01.530 --> 44:03.370
and Borg is also.

44:03.610 --> 44:07.370
And My grandchild told Me, “You know, why Borg has retired?

44:07.570 --> 44:10.050
Because another Sahaja Yogi has come now,

44:10.250 --> 44:12.200
the younger one, so give chance to him

44:12.400 --> 44:15.240
and that’s why he is very honorably retired”.

44:15.450 --> 44:17.850
Is because when McEnroe speaks, you must have seen,

44:18.050 --> 44:20.050
he tells himself “John, now behave yourself.”

44:20.250 --> 44:22.410
They are in the third person.

44:22.610 --> 44:24.450
And that’s why people don’t understand him

44:24.690 --> 44:26.170
and he doesn’t like to be insulted.

44:26.370 --> 44:29.010
And that’s very true. And anybody who is a saint

44:29.210 --> 44:30.690
doesn’t like him to be insulted.

44:30.890 --> 44:34.430
So like that you have so many people
who are realized souls, we can say.

44:34.630 --> 44:38.070
Even the Princess of Wales [Diana] is a realized soul

44:38.280 --> 44:39.930
and the new child is a realized soul.

44:40.130 --> 44:43.610
So there are so many people like that, who are realized souls.

44:44.570 --> 44:48.050
The listeners who will be tuning into this program on the radio,

44:48.250 --> 44:51.250
won’t have had the experience of being in Your presence.

44:51.450 --> 44:53.570
Some of them may have who were in this room.

44:53.770 --> 44:57.570
What can you say to them about how to become a realized soul,

44:57.770 --> 45:01.210
how to achieve this cool breeze that comes from…

45:01.450 --> 45:03.210
At the beginning of My lecture,

45:03.410 --> 45:06.210
if you tell them that they should put their hands towards the radio,

45:06.410 --> 45:08.370
just on the radio,

45:08.610 --> 45:10.170
they might feel the cool breeze.

45:10.370 --> 45:13.410
If they don’t feel it, then tell them to put the right hand first

45:13.610 --> 45:14.950
till they feel the cool breeze,

45:15.150 --> 45:17.240
and left hand up as if ventilating out.

45:17.450 --> 45:20.450
And then the left hand towards the radio

45:20.650 --> 45:21.850
and the right hand up.

45:22.050 --> 45:25.210
It might work out because it has worked in Hong Kong.

45:26.290 --> 45:27.860
I tell You it would be interesting.

45:28.060 --> 45:31.150
I interviewed Danny and Doug before You came

45:31.350 --> 45:33.890
so that listeners would have a chance to come here.

45:34.090 --> 45:35.440
And one of them called me

45:35.640 --> 45:37.930
and said that he went into a meditation in the afternoon

45:38.130 --> 45:40.970
and felt the cool breeze just by hearing them talk.

45:41.210 --> 45:43.300
See, if Sahaja Yogis can do it

45:43.500 --> 45:46.570
then when I’m talking it should happen.

45:51.250 --> 45:53.930
We are about at the end of the interview

45:54.130 --> 45:56.650
and what I want to do now, Mother, is give You a chance

45:56.850 --> 45:59.010
to say what’s in Your heart to say.

45:59.210 --> 46:01.650
What is there that You wish to share

46:01.890 --> 46:04.170
has not been said this evening?

46:04.370 --> 46:08.050
I have to say that America is a great country in the universe.

46:08.250 --> 46:11.770
It has the place of the Vishuddhi Chakra,

46:11.970 --> 46:16.970
which is the center of responsibility and discretion.

46:17.170 --> 46:20.240
And they have been so responsible so far.

46:20.450 --> 46:23.490
They have given such noble ideas of democracy

46:23.690 --> 46:26.400
and of freedom and all those things

46:26.600 --> 46:31.610
which are really all belonging to God’s ideas.

46:31.810 --> 46:33.970
And when they talk of all these things,

46:34.170 --> 46:37.680
we must know that there is something much more

46:37.880 --> 46:39.690
that they can give to the whole world.

46:39.890 --> 46:43.010
So many saints are born in this country because they realized

46:43.210 --> 46:45.320
that this is the country where they’ll be able

46:45.530 --> 46:48.170
to prosper better into their spirituality.

46:48.370 --> 46:51.610
So it is a very great responsibility of Americans

46:51.810 --> 46:54.610
to understand that we have had great leaders,

46:54.810 --> 46:56.490
we have had great noble ideals,

46:56.690 --> 46:58.690
we have had got great saints living here,

46:58.890 --> 47:01.490
so many are anxious to come down here.

47:01.690 --> 47:03.130
Only thing what we have to do

47:03.330 --> 47:05.970
is to establish within ourselves our Spirit,

47:06.170 --> 47:09.930
and to be ready and prepared for this great, tremendous work

47:10.130 --> 47:11.570
that is going to come now.

47:11.770 --> 47:13.960
And this is what the world has to do.

47:14.170 --> 47:18.290
If emancipation of the humanity has to take place,

47:18.490 --> 47:22.690
it has to take place only from inside out and not outside in.

47:22.890 --> 47:24.410
Another thing I would like to tell

47:24.610 --> 47:27.930
that the danger is not from outside for America,

47:28.130 --> 47:31.330
not from anywhere else. It is from within themselves.

47:31.570 --> 47:35.330
So be careful. We have to be careful about ourselves

47:35.530 --> 47:36.870
the way we are destroying.

47:37.070 --> 47:38.560
When we say, “What’s wrong?”

47:38.760 --> 47:41.320
we go head long into our destructions.

47:41.530 --> 47:44.530
Human beings should not take freedom as abandonment,

47:44.730 --> 47:49.210
but freedom to enjoy completely and fully.

47:49.410 --> 47:52.850
The freedom that takes you to a destruction is not freedom.

47:53.050 --> 47:55.330
And the right idea of freedom must be taken

47:55.570 --> 47:58.130
and people should know that freedom,

47:58.330 --> 48:02.090
ultimate freedom, is when you become your own master,

48:02.290 --> 48:05.680
when there are no habits,

48:05.890 --> 48:07.930
when you cannot be dominated by anything,

48:08.130 --> 48:11.370
you are above everything. That’s the freedom you have to achieve.

48:11.610 --> 48:12.640
And that is why

48:12.840 --> 48:15.570
people talked long time back in this country about freedom.

48:15.810 --> 48:18.170
They helped all the countries to get their freedom,

48:18.370 --> 48:19.890
and now it is their job

48:20.090 --> 48:23.970
to get them their own freedom within themselves

48:24.170 --> 48:25.850
so that others will also follow.

48:26.050 --> 48:27.560
May God bless you all.

48:27.770 --> 48:29.650
Thank you, Mother.

48:29.880 --> 48:31.820
May God bless you.

48:39.680 --> 48:42.420
Good? All right.

49:03.180 --> 49:06.250
Now, that was really nice of her to give so much time.

49:06.450 --> 49:07.610
You see, it's important,

49:07.850 --> 49:11.130
because your medias are also for Sahaja Yoga only created.

49:11.370 --> 49:12.930
Everything is for Sahaja Yoga.

49:13.130 --> 49:14.900
They have to act for Sahaja Yoga only,

49:15.100 --> 49:17.060
because this has to spread everywhere.

49:17.260 --> 49:19.420
Christ could not have met the whole world, you see?

49:19.620 --> 49:21.690
But I can.
