00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:10.500
Today we are going to worship the Hamsa Chakra.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:23.741
So far we have been always worshipping a Deity
and this is the second time you are worshipping

00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:27.170
this centre of Hamsa.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:43.081
Now this chakra is, it is, you know, placed
between the two eyebrows and two eyes represent

00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:50.070
the left and the right side.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:01:08.721
So this centre is very much guided by our
eyes, by our ears, by our nose, tongue, teeth,

00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:10.991
throat.

00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:20.551
Is a very important centre because the Vishuddhi,
which has to look after sixteen petals, which,

00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:29.471
sixteen petals, which look after all these
ear, nose, throat, different, different organs

00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:37.861
within us, also it has to communicate with
the Viraat.

00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:46.431
So it has to pass through this centre of Hamsa
Chakra.

00:01:46.431 --> 00:02:08.451
Hamsa Chakra is the very pivotal centre, which
expresses auspiciousness in our awareness.

00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:17.730
That means, if this centre is alert and awakened,
then we immediately know what is auspicious

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.961
and what is not auspicious, or we can call
it, we get the Divine Discretion.

00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:45.691
I think it is a part of the genetics that
people have discretion between good and bad,

00:02:45.691 --> 00:02:50.471
destructive and constructive.

00:02:50.471 --> 00:03:06.721
It is basically, has to be there, but we can
easily spoil it by all these organs which

00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:14.151
are collecting the conditionings and the ego
from outside.

00:03:14.151 --> 00:03:20.010
That’s why this centre is very vulnerable.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.801
Other centres are not so much connected outside
as this centre is connected, and receives

00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:31.000
all the information from, all these organs.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.031
For example, the eyes, now, we have.

00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:45.440
Eyes are very important because, they say
it, this is the window of the Spirit.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.771
And you have seen that when Kundalini rises,
and Spirit starts shining, there is a dilatation

00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:58.791
of the pupils and you look like an innocent
child and there’s a twinkle in your eyes.

00:03:58.791 --> 00:04:09.111
But the way that we play with our eyes all
the time, the way we use it indiscreetly with

00:04:09.111 --> 00:04:17.690
our lust and greed we can spoil this centre
very badly.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:33.701
Once we start taking to destructive things
in our life, we immediately become akin, or

00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:42.171
we start accepting, whatever is wrong, whatever
is destructive, very easily.

00:04:42.171 --> 00:04:50.391
I feel this is some sort of a genetic defect
because, in certain people, they will not

00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:56.710
accept anything that is stupid, idiotic or
destructive.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:06.021
But in certain people they’re very prone
and very easily can be taken to things which

00:05:06.021 --> 00:05:13.981
are absurd, which are stupid and which are
definitely destructive.

00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:26.571
This can become a very collective acceptance
also and once it becomes a collective acceptance,

00:05:26.571 --> 00:05:30.090
it starts penetrating throughout.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:37.530
It does not only have the effect of absorption,
but also it has an effect of affecting other

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.331
things.

00:05:39.331 --> 00:05:48.261
Say a person whose eyes are what we call flirtish
or roving eyes, such a person, if he goes

00:05:48.261 --> 00:05:54.060
to one group of people who do not know what
flirting is, do not know what roving eyes

00:05:54.060 --> 00:06:04.620
is, with very steady eyes, he can influence
those people and can make some of them of

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.571
the same kind.

00:06:07.571 --> 00:06:18.940
So what happens, really, is this, that, this
is a very good door for all kinds of bhoots

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:29.650
to enter, entities to enter, and when you
start projecting it back, the same bhoots

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:41.370
can pass into another person and can create
the same kind of vacuum or same kind of vulnerability

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:50.580
in the Hamsa Chakra of other people.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:58.590
So that’s why eyes have to be very, very
clean, innocent.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:07.141
Another, you can see, is what you hear.

00:07:07.141 --> 00:07:12.650
Some people, if they hear something nonsensical,
they’ll just put their hands to their ears.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.500
They don’t want to hear anything.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:25.030
But there are some people who like it and
go on enjoying it.

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:32.771
Ultimately, they become servile or, we can
say, conditioned, that they like all these

00:07:32.771 --> 00:07:41.060
horrible things that normally a human being
won’t like.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:50.241
Now, also you must have seen that people who,
like French people, I think they have no discretion

00:07:50.241 --> 00:07:51.241
of smell.

00:07:51.241 --> 00:08:02.191
They smell so awful, but they eat all rotten
food, rotten cheese, rotten, absolutely rotten

00:08:02.191 --> 00:08:06.371
wines, but they never smell it.

00:08:06.371 --> 00:08:07.941
Anybody in their company can smell it.

00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:12.391
Even their hands smell of their rotten cheese,
you can’t just [bare to] smell it.

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:15.001
But they have lost the power.

00:08:15.001 --> 00:08:21.511
In the same way, in our country we have a
caste called sweepers who do all the cleaning

00:08:21.511 --> 00:08:24.171
of dirty things with their hands.

00:08:24.171 --> 00:08:26.461
They have no sense of smell.

00:08:26.461 --> 00:08:28.571
They have lost the sense of smell.

00:08:28.571 --> 00:08:31.211
The nose has lost that smell sense.

00:08:31.211 --> 00:08:34.911
They cannot smell anything dirty.

00:08:34.911 --> 00:08:38.480
That’s how they can do their work.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:47.451
So if you start also not being alert to fragrance
– I’ve seen also there are certain things

00:08:47.451 --> 00:09:00.391
people use made of tobacco, they are supposed
to be very good, very famous brands of perfumes

00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:05.780
like ‘Tabac’ and all that.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:11.401
So once they start liking that kind of a thing,
then they have other things like ‘Poison‘

00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:16.451
and other horrible things, which, it’s horrible
smell in it.

00:09:16.451 --> 00:09:22.470
Apart from that, first [thing] you smell is
alcohol, is a spirit!

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:34.041
But they don’t mind because they see in
that a very congenial type of a pleasure.

00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:39.891
But these pleasures, ultimately, can kill
all the cells of the nose and afterwards one

00:09:39.891 --> 00:09:43.521
may even lose the sense of smell.

00:09:43.521 --> 00:09:48.601
One of the joy-giving organ is the sense of
smell.

00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:54.141
When the Kundalini rises in many people they
get a fragrance of many things.

00:09:54.141 --> 00:10:01.621
Some people get of guggul or sometimes they
get a fragrance of sandalwood or something,

00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:09.530
which is a very natural essence of flowers
or maybe of some woods.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:22.831
But these unnaturally made things which are
actually destructive to your cells of smelling,

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:28.891
that is what they start using, and once you
start using these kind of things then what

00:10:28.891 --> 00:10:33.970
happens is that you don’t feel any bad smell
anywhere, like animals.

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:38.711
But so many animals can smell, if not they
don’t call it bad or good, but they can

00:10:38.711 --> 00:10:41.731
smell.

00:10:41.731 --> 00:10:48.121
Even that sensitivity of good and bad smell
which we human beings have got is lost.

00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:55.920
So whatever is our ascent, as human beings,
at what a level we have gone, start completely

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.731
disappearing, gradually, one by one.

00:11:00.731 --> 00:11:03.581
Then same with the throat.

00:11:03.581 --> 00:11:23.280
If the throat is using bad languages and is
being used for abusing people, showing temper

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:36.021
on people or anything of aggression or sometimes
people take things which can also spoil the

00:11:36.021 --> 00:11:49.110
throat by their destructive qualities, like
alcohol; specially the smoking.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:56.160
If you smoke then the throat gets vulnerable
and the sweetness of your voice is lost.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.371
Then they speak with a hoarse voice.

00:12:00.371 --> 00:12:03.050
But this is all external.

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:05.931
It starts becoming external.

00:12:05.931 --> 00:12:17.631
Mouth smells with that and also the teeth
react to all such things, which we take without

00:12:17.631 --> 00:12:23.632
discretion about it, because that’s the
fashion, because it is marketing well, because

00:12:23.632 --> 00:12:25.961
it is advertised!

00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:32.251
That means we have not got our own wisdom,
our own personality.

00:12:32.251 --> 00:12:40.160
But when this centre is awakened, then what
you develop is a discretion.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:50.401
As I was telling them yesterday how the word
Hamsa has come for this centre.

00:12:50.401 --> 00:12:58.401
Because there’s a Sanskrit, very beautiful,
couplet, which says that a swan is white and

00:12:58.401 --> 00:13:01.571
a crane is a white bird.

00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:08.531
What is the difference between the swan and
a crane?

00:13:08.531 --> 00:13:16.331
The answer is that when you mix milk with
water, the swan will just suck in the milk

00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:26.251
while the crane has no discretion, no vivek.

00:13:26.251 --> 00:13:37.191
This discretionary power, once we start losing,
we start becoming just like robots, I would

00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:40.800
say, because we have no personality.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:47.980
Anybody can brainwash us and the more they
tell us about our discretion we listen to

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:48.980
them.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:55.131
That explains why people, so many thousands
of people, go to all these false gurus.

00:13:55.131 --> 00:14:01.201
Thousands of people, why did they take to
homosexuality and got into AIDS?

00:14:01.201 --> 00:14:10.281
Why thousands of people have taken to drugs?

00:14:10.281 --> 00:14:12.900
It is unbelievable!

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:15.141
Incredible!

00:14:15.141 --> 00:14:19.751
Why people have taken to all these things
[and] are destroying their life.

00:14:19.751 --> 00:14:25.420
They see a man going into the pub, coming
out and falling down on the ground with all

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.941
his purse being emptied.

00:14:27.941 --> 00:14:32.710
But they go with the purse, see that they
have sufficient money to go inside the pub,

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.831
again come out to fall down on the street.

00:14:35.831 --> 00:14:46.321
Whatever idiotic or nonsensical [things] other
people are doing, when you see they’re idiotic,

00:14:46.321 --> 00:14:50.441
you pay money to become idiotic.

00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:57.631
One pays money to destroy oneself, go out
of the way.

00:14:57.631 --> 00:15:01.391
It is so unnatural for anyone.

00:15:01.391 --> 00:15:08.401
I mean even a dog or a cat, or any animal,
knows where is the danger is.

00:15:08.401 --> 00:15:14.340
They can smell the danger and they run away
because they have to preserve their lives.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:21.160
They think their lives are precious and they
must live and live well.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:29.231
But this ordinary, common sense starts missing
and they will say, “What’s wrong?

00:15:29.231 --> 00:15:31.321
What’s wrong in this?

00:15:31.321 --> 00:15:33.941
What’s wrong in that?”

00:15:33.941 --> 00:15:38.501
That means the genetics of the Hamsa are missing.

00:15:38.501 --> 00:15:51.451
Now you should see there is no Deity on the
Hamsa Chakra, but it is the formless energy

00:15:51.451 --> 00:16:12.061
of so many organs which are looked after by
Buddha, Mahavira, Christ, Shri Krishna – four

00:16:12.061 --> 00:16:17.831
of them, managed by Shri Ganesha.

00:16:17.831 --> 00:16:24.701
So these genetics are put by Shri Ganesha
because He is the source of the Wisdom.

00:16:24.701 --> 00:16:35.531
So first, once they spoil their Mooladhara,
the wisdom is finished: [the] basis, the fundamentals,

00:16:35.531 --> 00:16:37.011
are finished.

00:16:37.011 --> 00:16:50.511
That’s why immoral life is very detrimental
to our life because we lose our discretion,

00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:53.381
the discretion is lost.

00:16:53.381 --> 00:17:07.911
Then if you can awaken Shri Ganesha in the
Hamsa Chakra, then suddenly you belong to

00:17:07.911 --> 00:17:11.621
the higher race of Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:11.621 --> 00:17:13.651
It’s surprising.

00:17:13.651 --> 00:17:21.361
I’ve seen people overnight give up their
drugs, very immoral people become extremely

00:17:21.361 --> 00:17:31.680
moral because of this chakra being suddenly
awakened and the light of the Spirit is best

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:44.291
expressed through this chakra in everyday
life, in the collective life also.

00:17:44.291 --> 00:17:49.961
One starts then seeing the point, as we say.

00:17:49.961 --> 00:17:54.841
Like now, in Sahaja Yogas, we have different
problems, also.

00:17:54.841 --> 00:18:03.180
Say, when people first come to Sahaja Yoga,
they start watching other people and starting

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:07.481
finding their faults, what’s wrong with
them.

00:18:07.481 --> 00:18:10.570
They never see what they are here for.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:17.001
They are not here to find out faults with
others, but to correct your own defects.

00:18:17.001 --> 00:18:18.820
So they say, “Oh, this man is no good.

00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:19.871
That man is no good.

00:18:19.871 --> 00:18:20.961
This is wrong.”

00:18:20.961 --> 00:18:23.171
They start creating problems, you see.

00:18:23.171 --> 00:18:27.810
They’ll talk to each other, saying, “Oh
this man is not good.

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:31.711
That man is not good,” try create groups
and things.

00:18:31.711 --> 00:18:36.471
They’re here to offer what?

00:18:36.471 --> 00:18:44.101
Or create a politics or for your ascent?

00:18:44.101 --> 00:18:49.371
Some of them, if they do not do all this,
then they think we should start to make some

00:18:49.371 --> 00:19:03.721
money out of it or some sort of a thing, or
some start criticising others about something,

00:19:03.721 --> 00:19:10.180
which is not their concern.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:15.011
So they forget because they are just now coming
to Sahaja Yoga and their genetics are not

00:19:15.011 --> 00:19:17.450
established of their wisdom.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:26.411
They start worrying about things, which are
not their worry, which they should not bother

00:19:26.411 --> 00:19:30.721
about.

00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:34.101
Then some of them start thinking, “Oh, I
am the leader!”

00:19:34.101 --> 00:19:39.141
or “Why am I not the leader?”

00:19:39.141 --> 00:19:42.371
So they start finding fault with the leadership.

00:19:42.371 --> 00:19:46.811
Sometimes leader also can feel, “Oh, I am
the leader.

00:19:46.811 --> 00:19:54.241
I can be very stern, very disciplinary and
I can control people.

00:19:54.241 --> 00:19:57.221
I can do this.”

00:19:57.221 --> 00:20:08.930
They have come here to learn how to love,
to be compassionate, to be tolerant.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:24.531
The sense of leadership and also of obedience
– both are discretionary.

00:20:24.531 --> 00:20:33.221
If somebody says something to you and if you
obey that person for your benevolence, you

00:20:33.221 --> 00:20:40.060
will subtly understand that it is for your
good.

00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:46.211
If some leader says that “This is wrong
with you,” try to see if it is wrong, instead

00:20:46.211 --> 00:20:48.391
of feeling hurt about it.

00:20:48.391 --> 00:20:51.091
“Yes, it is wrong with me.

00:20:51.091 --> 00:20:52.161
So what should I do?

00:20:52.161 --> 00:20:53.371
How can I improve myself?”

00:20:53.371 --> 00:20:56.281
Ask the leader or you can write to Me or do
anything.

00:20:56.281 --> 00:20:57.281
But no!

00:20:57.281 --> 00:20:58.281
They will not do it.

00:20:58.281 --> 00:21:01.920
Immediately they will write a letter to Me
saying, “This leader is such-and-such, bad

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.920
fellow.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.920
He’s so this thing.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.940
He ate that money.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.021
He ate that thing!”

00:21:06.021 --> 00:21:09.121
and all kinds of things.

00:21:09.121 --> 00:21:14.221
Or else they may tell people, “Oh, Mother
listens to this fellow.

00:21:14.221 --> 00:21:15.221
He’s no good.

00:21:15.221 --> 00:21:17.351
He’s just telling Mother stories and Mother
listens!”

00:21:17.351 --> 00:21:20.741
Mother is not such a fool.

00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:27.221
She knows about everything.

00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:33.211
So all these things that we have gathered
from our previous life, even after our second

00:21:33.211 --> 00:21:34.820
birth we carry little bit.

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:42.330
Like an egg becomes a bird but still lots
of things of the egg are hanging on to his

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.271
body, so you have to cleanse it.

00:21:44.271 --> 00:21:48.851
So, at this point, when you have got your
realisation, the first discretion should be,

00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:55.471
“How am I going to achieve that state of
Spirit?”

00:21:55.471 --> 00:21:57.050
The Pure Spirit!

00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:05.631
Instead of that, also, people get lost because
they have no discretion.

00:22:05.631 --> 00:22:15.591
With this enlightenment, first thing that
happens, I’ve seen with people: Their eyes

00:22:15.591 --> 00:22:17.681
are fixed.

00:22:17.681 --> 00:22:20.861
They don’t rove their eyes much now.

00:22:20.861 --> 00:22:26.560
They have very innocent eyes.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:33.731
Otherwise they are really mad, those people
who go on looking at everything like this.

00:22:33.731 --> 00:22:36.231
There’s no difference between madman and
him.

00:22:36.231 --> 00:22:42.131
You put one madman, he does the same and a
person who is like that does the same.

00:22:42.131 --> 00:22:51.631
And it’s such a crazy thing to do, but immediately…I
mean, it is such a spontaneous thing.

00:22:51.631 --> 00:22:55.751
It’s like the light coming in the room.

00:22:55.751 --> 00:23:00.690
It is so spontaneous that you start seeing
things clearly – “No, no.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:06.271
This is not good!”

00:23:06.271 --> 00:23:12.271
Before in the garden, you would go and collect
all the thorns and put them in your body.

00:23:12.271 --> 00:23:15.611
That was the situation.

00:23:15.611 --> 00:23:19.211
Never looked at the flowers.

00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:24.641
And suddenly, after realisation, you will
be amazed, you just see flowers and don’t

00:23:24.641 --> 00:23:30.661
bother about thorns, or if you find you take
them out.

00:23:30.661 --> 00:23:41.001
There is joy even before realisation and after
realisation, but there is no capacity to enjoy.

00:23:41.001 --> 00:23:50.570
That capacity comes to you after realisation
and the main thing that happens to you is

00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:52.351
the discretion.

00:23:52.351 --> 00:23:58.481
Then, like the swan, you just take the milk
of everything.

00:23:58.481 --> 00:24:09.991
At everything your attitude becomes very different,
you start seeing things in a different angle.

00:24:09.991 --> 00:24:18.801
Like once we had to go to one very ancient
temple to see some art.

00:24:18.801 --> 00:24:26.141
Me, my son-in-law and my daughter, we were
walking up up, we had to walk for miles, up

00:24:26.141 --> 00:24:31.930
the hill and they were very tired so we went
into one temple and just laid down ourselves.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.290
They were so tired.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:39.951
At that time I said, “See these elephants,
see how beautiful they are, every one has

00:24:39.951 --> 00:24:51.930
a different type of a tail and a different
type of a trunk, the poses are different.

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:54.031
So many of them are like that.”

00:24:54.031 --> 00:24:55.391
My son-in-law said, “Babaa!

00:24:55.391 --> 00:24:56.881
We are so tired.

00:24:56.881 --> 00:25:00.690
How are you looking at these things?”

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:07.011
Because attention didn’t go to my tiredness
but to those beautiful things.

00:25:07.011 --> 00:25:11.131
Same thing, you start sucking in the milk.

00:25:11.131 --> 00:25:19.961
There is joy but you cannot feel the joy because
the power, that subtle power of Divine Discretion

00:25:19.961 --> 00:25:22.301
is not there.

00:25:22.301 --> 00:25:24.911
Once that comes in, you start enjoying everything.

00:25:24.911 --> 00:25:35.971
It’s just the same, [your] life is just
the same, nothing has changed: same house,

00:25:35.971 --> 00:25:41.231
same family, same city, same environment.

00:25:41.231 --> 00:25:52.731
But you start enjoying because the sensitivity
of your Hamsa Chakra is now only for Divine

00:25:52.731 --> 00:26:01.211
Discretion and you immediately know and then
you don’t want to do anything with the thorns,

00:26:01.211 --> 00:26:08.111
only want to gather flowers and you know how
to gather flowers and you are in joy.

00:26:08.111 --> 00:26:19.361
So the light of the Spirit, which shines through
your Hamsa Chakra, gives you wisdom.

00:26:19.361 --> 00:26:25.021
Wisdom doesn’t mean that you know how to
argue things or you fight with people.

00:26:25.021 --> 00:26:26.701
No, it doesn’t mean that!

00:26:26.701 --> 00:26:40.681
Wisdom means how you take to the good side
of everything, to enjoy it, this is Wisdom.

00:26:40.681 --> 00:26:48.591
And that you avoid all destructive things
and take to something constructive.

00:26:48.591 --> 00:26:56.431
Now you are going, say, on a road and is written
there – there’s danger.

00:26:56.431 --> 00:26:58.611
Before realisation they will say, “All right.

00:26:58.611 --> 00:26:59.691
Let’s see what is danger.”

00:26:59.691 --> 00:27:06.501
They’ll jump into it and say that, “We
have got nirvana” by killing themselves.

00:27:06.501 --> 00:27:08.501
Such explanations!

00:27:08.501 --> 00:27:10.991
But a sensible man will say, “All right,
danger?

00:27:10.991 --> 00:27:11.991
Go back.

00:27:11.991 --> 00:27:14.001
What’s the harm, after all?”

00:27:14.001 --> 00:27:18.291
He preserves himself.

00:27:18.291 --> 00:27:27.361
He respects his life because he knows now
[that] he has become the instrument of God.

00:27:27.361 --> 00:27:35.381
So Wisdom comes to you automatically, but
through experience.

00:27:35.381 --> 00:27:39.501
Then you know this is the right path.

00:27:39.501 --> 00:27:43.251
Through experience you start understanding.

00:27:43.251 --> 00:27:45.440
Nowadays I am telling all these things to
you.

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:50.061
Say, if, twenty years back, I never talked
of these things to them, [it was] because

00:27:50.061 --> 00:27:53.830
I knew if I start talking, they’ll say,
“Oh, She’s talking something out of the

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:54.830
blue.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:58.011
God knows if it is true or not.”

00:27:58.011 --> 00:28:06.781
But once the wisdom becomes transparent and
you start seeing through it, everything, very

00:28:06.781 --> 00:28:15.371
clearly, makes your mind absolutely clear
then, anybody who then tells things of wisdom,

00:28:15.371 --> 00:28:21.621
you never feel bad about it, on the contrary,
you thank that “I’m so lucky that I can

00:28:21.621 --> 00:28:26.060
hear about these things, such a nice things!”

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:29.540
And also those sayings start giving you joy.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:35.221
So, with the ear you hear so many things.

00:28:35.221 --> 00:28:39.731
Used to hear the same things, might [be] hearing
so much music, everything – before also

00:28:39.731 --> 00:28:42.911
– but never gave you joy.

00:28:42.911 --> 00:28:51.501
Now, because of this transformation, the same
music, which you heard before, now makes you

00:28:51.501 --> 00:28:55.670
feel as if you are in the seventh heaven.

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:57.711
It gives you ecstasy.

00:28:57.711 --> 00:29:04.651
The poetry, which was quite mundane, ordinary,
people told Me, “Mother, it was such a headache

00:29:04.651 --> 00:29:06.950
to read William Blake in those days.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:08.391
But now we love it.

00:29:08.391 --> 00:29:11.160
We read it like Bible!”

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:17.721
Because now you have developed new sight,
new hearing power.

00:29:17.721 --> 00:29:24.310
All these are called in Sanskrit ‘atindrya’,
means ‘the organs which are subtle organs

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:25.341
within us’.

00:29:25.341 --> 00:29:36.680
So eyes have a subtle organ, ears have a subtle
organ and these subtle organs then start emitting

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:46.271
such responses to all the surroundings that
you just gather whatever is beautiful.

00:29:46.271 --> 00:29:50.741
Say it is very dark.

00:29:50.741 --> 00:29:55.241
Normally, you’ll be frightened.

00:29:55.241 --> 00:30:00.781
But if it is very dark, you say, “Oh, it’s
very good.

00:30:00.781 --> 00:30:02.291
How we are enjoying here na?

00:30:02.291 --> 00:30:04.111
It’s such venturesome thing!”

00:30:04.111 --> 00:30:08.560
You’ll go slowly, slowly holding each other’s
hands.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:14.501
Supposing it is very hot: Then maybe somebody
would say, people may start, I don’t know

00:30:14.501 --> 00:30:17.060
what they would do!

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:21.492
Another would just say, “It’s quite nice
day, you see, it’s nice sometimes to also

00:30:21.492 --> 00:30:22.492
have hot.

00:30:22.492 --> 00:30:23.492
It’s also very good!”

00:30:23.492 --> 00:30:24.492
– like that.

00:30:24.492 --> 00:30:25.540
If it is cold, the other way round.

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:32.101
So, thus you start enjoying every aspect which
is supposed to be very, very bad for others,

00:30:32.101 --> 00:30:38.450
[but] to you, you know the aspect of that,
what is to be enjoyed, that part which is

00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:47.861
to be enjoyed, and once you know how to do
it, then you say, “We are swimming in the

00:30:47.861 --> 00:30:49.641
Ocean of Joy.”

00:30:49.641 --> 00:31:02.481
The Ocean is the same, but now you just achieve
those beautiful drops of ambrosia which are

00:31:02.481 --> 00:31:09.851
in that Ocean and the rest are worried of
getting drowned.

00:31:09.851 --> 00:31:11.320
Same Ocean!

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:12.320
Same world!

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.170
That’s why they say it’s a maya.

00:31:16.170 --> 00:31:23.530
But after this discretion is shining there’s
no maya – you start enjoying.

00:31:23.530 --> 00:31:31.680
It’s like this, supposing you drop somebody
in the ocean, he’ll be so frightened and

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.981
he’ll die before even he’s sunk really!

00:31:34.981 --> 00:31:41.060
But supposing a person there is, with all
his things to watch and he is the one who

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:46.800
is going to see all the beauty of the underworld.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.570
He’s very nicely secured.

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:55.261
He’s got big, beautiful glasses and all
that and he’s wearing nice paddles.

00:31:55.261 --> 00:31:57.950
He doesn’t have to bother.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:02.251
He just goes there, nicely enjoys everything,
takes photographs.

00:32:02.251 --> 00:32:10.491
The ocean is the same for him or for the one
who is dropped in the ocean.

00:32:10.491 --> 00:32:17.521
But the one who is secured, the one who has
all the equipments, the one who knows what

00:32:17.521 --> 00:32:21.530
is to be seen is enjoying it.

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:29.251
In the same way, you are equipped with wisdom,
with security and you know what you are doing,

00:32:29.251 --> 00:32:34.221
and the same thing starts becoming so very
beautiful and enjoyable.

00:32:34.221 --> 00:32:38.851
I have seen how Sahaja Yogis enjoy everything.

00:32:38.851 --> 00:32:47.290
Even if somebody is shouting or saying something
in a hall, I’ve seen all the Sahaja Yogis

00:32:47.290 --> 00:32:49.601
start laughing, laughing, laughing, you know.

00:32:49.601 --> 00:32:55.430
He’s, poor man, trying his level best to
condemn everything, and here all the Sahaja

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:59.991
Yogis – just laughing at him, doing nothing,
and that fellow runs away.

00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:07.070
It is something so…I mean they’re enjoying
his stupidity.

00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:16.891
So the whole attitude of life is so changed
because of this Hamsa Chakra and you are not

00:33:16.891 --> 00:33:22.341
even aware that you have developed that Wisdom…automatically!

00:33:22.341 --> 00:33:32.881
Then you start also consolidating it and making
it your own enlightened faith because every

00:33:32.881 --> 00:33:42.321
time you see [that] whatever you believe in
just works out.

00:33:42.321 --> 00:33:55.272
You see, suddenly you find that things are
brought to you without your knowledge, without

00:33:55.272 --> 00:34:00.631
any effort, which you have been trying to
get.

00:34:00.631 --> 00:34:04.731
People suddenly meet you and you are helped.

00:34:04.731 --> 00:34:07.581
So many things happen.

00:34:07.581 --> 00:34:13.001
Recently, somebody came from India and he
had said that, “I would like to meet somebody

00:34:13.001 --> 00:34:15.731
at Milan station“.

00:34:15.731 --> 00:34:20.561
So we sent somebody, but he was wearing a
very small, little badge so this gentleman

00:34:20.561 --> 00:34:29.140
couldn’t see, and he was watching for somebody
there.

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:37.831
Suddenly, he saw one gentleman standing, like
a Sahaja Yogi, very relaxed, watching everybody,

00:34:37.831 --> 00:34:40.641
not running, not upset.

00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:42.880
He went and asked him, “Did you come for
me?”

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.281
“Yes, yes, yes.

00:34:44.281 --> 00:34:45.281
I was wondering.

00:34:45.281 --> 00:34:48.181
I thought it is you only who has come.”

00:34:48.181 --> 00:34:55.691
So, you make them out because their styles
are different, their standing methods are

00:34:55.691 --> 00:34:59.951
different, their talking is different, the
way they behave.

00:34:59.951 --> 00:35:10.121
It’s all, you see, is a miracle the way
the whole life and personality is changed.

00:35:10.121 --> 00:35:20.261
Once my husband had taken a Sahaja Yogi to
a library, a British library and people are

00:35:20.261 --> 00:35:21.431
very rude there.

00:35:21.431 --> 00:35:25.731
So they were late by about one or two minutes
and it was closing time.

00:35:25.731 --> 00:35:29.301
The fellow just started shouting at him.

00:35:29.301 --> 00:35:30.791
So the Sahaja Yogi said, “Yes, I agree.

00:35:30.791 --> 00:35:36.441
You see, we are late, but these traffics don’t
understand any laws that this library closes

00:35:36.441 --> 00:35:38.201
at this time, you know.

00:35:38.201 --> 00:35:40.251
They don’t understand – the traffic, you
see.

00:35:40.251 --> 00:35:41.640
They wouldn’t listen to us.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:46.771
We told them the library’s closing, you
see,” Fellow started looking at them!

00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:48.412
“But they wouldn’t understand it.

00:35:48.412 --> 00:35:49.412
So important.

00:35:49.412 --> 00:35:56.211
You know, the traffic was stopping us and
we are sorry we are here so late, but next

00:35:56.211 --> 00:35:57.501
time we’ll not do like that.”

00:35:57.501 --> 00:36:05.841
The fellow got absolutely so flabbergasted
and the whole thing melted away.

00:36:05.841 --> 00:36:07.471
He said, “All right, come along.”

00:36:07.471 --> 00:36:13.711
He opened the library for one hour after that.

00:36:13.711 --> 00:36:24.011
So the wisdom of handling people, wisdom of
talking to them, wisdom of handling your jobs,

00:36:24.011 --> 00:36:26.671
everything starts working out.

00:36:26.671 --> 00:36:31.211
And if it doesn’t work, you don’t feel
bad.

00:36:31.211 --> 00:36:32.211
You think, “What to do?

00:36:32.211 --> 00:36:36.511
The other fellow is not a Sahaja Yogi”.

00:36:36.511 --> 00:36:39.191
You tried it’s…what can be done?

00:36:39.191 --> 00:36:47.541
Like this time, when we were coming, there
was a nice gentleman who is something like

00:36:47.541 --> 00:36:49.991
a manager in the KLM and all that.

00:36:49.991 --> 00:36:54.880
So he came and told Me, “There’s a little
difficulty that there’s no seat for others.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.501
Only three persons first class can go.

00:36:58.501 --> 00:36:59.921
It’s impossible.

00:36:59.921 --> 00:37:01.521
He’s a friend of mine.

00:37:01.521 --> 00:37:03.391
He just can’t help you.”

00:37:03.391 --> 00:37:04.891
I said, “All right.”

00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:06.681
I went and sat on the chair.

00:37:06.681 --> 00:37:10.541
I did like this (bandhan) only I think, three
times must have.

00:37:10.541 --> 00:37:14.860
“Oh, there are six seats already there!

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:18.651
From where did they come up?”

00:37:18.651 --> 00:37:24.211
So then you start seeing one point very clearly
ki (that) there is this All-Pervading Power

00:37:24.211 --> 00:37:27.321
which is very active, which is watching us.

00:37:27.321 --> 00:37:33.360
All the great saints are managing things.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:41.221
Or sometimes you feel as if the angels are
with you, how they’re guiding things, how

00:37:41.221 --> 00:37:44.701
they’re helping us, how they’re there,
how it is working out.

00:37:44.701 --> 00:37:52.041
Then you start seeing all that, then you start
knowing it and believing in it, then this

00:37:52.041 --> 00:37:55.491
discretion settles down.

00:37:55.491 --> 00:38:02.201
Till that state it is settled down, it’s
quite possible that Sahaja Yogis might slip

00:38:02.201 --> 00:38:04.191
out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:04.191 --> 00:38:09.600
I have known many that, they come to Sahaja
Yoga and just slip out on small, small points

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.551
like that.

00:38:11.551 --> 00:38:17.610
Some other Sahaja Yogi, of their style only,
can say something harsh to them and they slip

00:38:17.610 --> 00:38:18.610
out.

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:23.761
Because on the periphery we have all kinds
of people and on the periphery if you stop

00:38:23.761 --> 00:38:29.130
and somebody says something to you, then they
drop out because they have not reached that

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:35.370
state of discretion that, “This is the right
place I’m in.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:38.621
If another is wrong, he’ll get out.

00:38:38.621 --> 00:38:41.641
Why should I get out?”

00:38:41.641 --> 00:38:49.241
The growth is only possible when your Hamsa
is put right.

00:38:49.241 --> 00:38:55.611
Without that till you are completely there,
it’s very difficult.

00:38:55.611 --> 00:39:06.281
But once the Hamsa is established, I have
seen people become really very dedicated.

00:39:06.281 --> 00:39:09.751
As you know, it is very big organisation we
have, all over the world.

00:39:09.751 --> 00:39:16.641
I have no secretary, I have no organisation,
I have nothing like an office also.

00:39:16.641 --> 00:39:23.481
But everything, everybody’s my secretary,
everybody’s working it out on their own.

00:39:23.481 --> 00:39:25.451
They’re identified with it.

00:39:25.451 --> 00:39:27.981
They are responsible for it.

00:39:27.981 --> 00:39:30.390
I don’t have…I’m like a plug, they put
Me here, alright, there, there.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:34.101
It’s all right wherever they put!

00:39:34.101 --> 00:39:39.850
Only this much of discretion, that they’re
my children, they’ll not do anything to

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:42.881
harm Me, they’ll look after Me.

00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:52.021
Sometimes, of course, it could be quite hectic,
could be very fast movement, whatever it is,

00:39:52.021 --> 00:40:00.061
but I don’t mind because they are doing
so much for Sahaja Yoga and they want to do

00:40:00.061 --> 00:40:06.171
it more and more and they are so responsible.

00:40:06.171 --> 00:40:10.610
So I respect it.

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:14.120
Sometimes people say, “Mother, what a horrible
schedule You have.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.701
We can’t bear to see it, you see, it is
too much.

00:40:16.701 --> 00:40:17.701
How will You do this?”

00:40:17.701 --> 00:40:20.201
I can do it!!

00:40:20.201 --> 00:40:28.640
Because I have absolute faith in their identification
with Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:30.061
They are not cheats.

00:40:30.061 --> 00:40:31.291
They are not hypocrites.

00:40:31.291 --> 00:40:37.871
They’re not doing for their own being, own
self, but they’re doing it to help Sahaja

00:40:37.871 --> 00:40:44.111
Yoga, to help others.

00:40:44.111 --> 00:40:50.431
So the identification that you develop with
other wrong things just drops out, then you

00:40:50.431 --> 00:40:55.711
start identifying yourself with beautiful
things because you start getting the fragrance

00:40:55.711 --> 00:40:57.521
of the beauty.

00:40:57.521 --> 00:41:05.551
Then you start enjoying that beauty and your
heart starts opening out.

00:41:05.551 --> 00:41:17.201
All this joy and all these things are not
possible if your Hamsa is still infected with

00:41:17.201 --> 00:41:20.801
ego or with conditionings.

00:41:20.801 --> 00:41:26.281
We have so many conditionings like Hindus,
like Christians, like this, like that.

00:41:26.281 --> 00:41:31.671
These conditionings are so much.

00:41:31.671 --> 00:41:37.071
Such false things we are following.

00:41:37.071 --> 00:41:44.981
But once we give up all these conditionings
in the faith that we are doing it for our

00:41:44.981 --> 00:41:51.231
benevolence, this Agnya, this chakra opens
out very well.

00:41:51.231 --> 00:41:54.691
Without this, Agnya cannot open.

00:41:54.691 --> 00:42:02.511
I mean, you see, it’s an entry to Agnya,
it’s the entry to Vishuddhi, it’s the

00:42:02.511 --> 00:42:08.001
entry to all the chakras of your head, the
peethas that are there.

00:42:08.001 --> 00:42:15.401
So it’s so important to keep your Hamsa
Chakra clean!

00:42:15.401 --> 00:42:23.671
I’ve also told lots of things that can keep
the Hamsa Chakra clean, which you all should

00:42:23.671 --> 00:42:28.031
use, I mean on the physical level.

00:42:28.031 --> 00:42:34.491
Also on the mental level I’ve told you what
you have to do: is to steady your mind, see

00:42:34.491 --> 00:42:44.620
the beauty of anything and not the vulgarity
of it, not the utility of it, but the beauty.

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:57.130
Slowly, slowly you’ll find your eyes will
become cleaner and cleaner.

00:42:57.130 --> 00:43:06.961
People are now so much in Sahaja Yoga because
of their depth maybe, because of their seeking

00:43:06.961 --> 00:43:15.271
maybe, because of their janmas (births) maybe
or whatever it is.

00:43:15.271 --> 00:43:23.941
But this Hamsa Chakra does the greatest thing
about which, I do not know if you are aware

00:43:23.941 --> 00:43:30.600
or not, that, whatever are your karma phalas
(fruits of your actions) are finished.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:37.691
You are not responsible for your forefathers
karma phalas, your country’s karma phalas

00:43:37.691 --> 00:43:41.261
your own personal karma phalas.

00:43:41.261 --> 00:43:53.390
Whatever wrong you have done is finished,
as if you are cut off from your past completely.

00:43:53.390 --> 00:44:06.051
Once this is established, then all mistakes,
all wrong-doings, not only of you, of your

00:44:06.051 --> 00:44:12.751
relations, of your forefathers, of your family,
of your country, of this world, anything,

00:44:12.751 --> 00:44:13.751
doesn’t touch you.

00:44:13.751 --> 00:44:18.561
You are aloof from it.

00:44:18.561 --> 00:44:29.870
And in this Krita Yuga where this Brahmachaitanya
is

00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:39.701
trying to expose and to punish people for
their past karmas – collectively also, country-wise

00:44:39.701 --> 00:44:51.830
also – will not be able to even touch you
because the light of this centre is extremely

00:44:51.830 --> 00:45:02.651
powerful and you will be redeemed of all the
fears of whatever you have done before.

00:45:02.651 --> 00:45:13.360
You’ll just be beautiful like lotuses, which
are come out of the mire, and you’ll emit

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:16.021
beautiful fragrance all around the world.

00:45:16.021 --> 00:45:18.600
May God bless you all.
