00:04.120 --> 00:19.349
Last night was a night of complete darkness,
that they call it as amavasya; and just now

00:19.349 --> 00:24.830
only the first phase of the moon has started.

00:24.830 --> 00:39.890
Today we are here to celebrate the day when
the Sahastrara was opened out.

00:39.890 --> 00:44.969
Also you have seen in the photograph.

00:44.969 --> 00:53.770
It was actually a photograph of my brain,
which showed how the Sahastrara was opened

00:53.770 --> 00:54.820
out.

00:54.820 --> 00:59.800
The light of the brain now could be photographed.

00:59.800 --> 01:04.339
It’s something great these modern times
have done.

01:04.339 --> 01:10.270
So the modern times have brought a lot of
things which can prove the existence of the

01:10.270 --> 01:12.260
Divine.

01:12.260 --> 01:19.820
Also it can prove about me.

01:19.820 --> 01:25.420
It can convince you what I am.

01:25.420 --> 01:36.790
This is very important because, in the modern
times, this advent has to be recognised, has

01:36.790 --> 01:38.120
to be fully recognised.

01:38.120 --> 01:43.630
This is one of the conditions for all the
Sahaja Yogis.

01:43.630 --> 01:53.680
Now let’s see what’s happening in the
modern times, in the brains of the people.

01:53.680 --> 02:03.790
In the brains of the people today, if you
see, there is an attack on the Sahastrara.

02:03.790 --> 02:11.430
There has been an attack since long but in
the modern times it’s the worst time.

02:11.430 --> 02:25.680
They are trying to make the limbic area very
insensitive.

02:25.680 --> 02:44.200
Very depressive novels, very depressive thoughts
and very depressive music, you can say, like

02:44.200 --> 02:46.310
Greek tragedy nonsense.

02:46.310 --> 03:05.349
All these things came from the medieval period
till, we should say, this new age has started.

03:05.349 --> 03:10.220
That one itself was no good for our limbic
area.

03:10.220 --> 03:13.489
That made us very depressive.

03:13.489 --> 03:26.780
We took to alcoholism to escape from the so-called
miseries.

03:26.780 --> 03:41.310
But then came this modern age in which people
became overactive – over-activity started.

03:41.310 --> 03:49.670
With that the brain also became overactive.

03:49.670 --> 03:59.230
In addition to the dullness before, it’s
gone to the other extreme of over-activity.

03:59.230 --> 04:10.189
So to dull it again they took to drugs, they
took to very horrible music.

04:10.189 --> 04:18.250
That’s how they made this limbic area very,
very insensitive.

04:18.250 --> 04:30.840
So a drug which was just a stimulus to begin
with was to be taken in greater quantity and

04:30.840 --> 04:40.139
later on they had to take the drugs which
were of a much more severe nature.

04:40.139 --> 04:46.740
It went on like that and now we know that
this drug is the only way people think they

04:46.740 --> 04:49.900
can survive.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.639
Why?

04:52.639 --> 04:54.879
Because of the tension [that] they talk of.

04:54.879 --> 04:59.020
In the modern times we have something called
‘tensions’.

04:59.020 --> 05:00.590
It was never there before.

05:00.590 --> 05:02.870
People never talked of their tensions.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.910
Now every body says, “I’m in a tension!”

05:05.910 --> 05:08.110
“You give me a tension!”

05:08.110 --> 05:10.670
What is this tension?

05:10.670 --> 05:15.130
It’s because of my advent.

05:15.130 --> 05:23.669
The limbic area wants to know about me.

05:23.669 --> 05:33.151
And the Kundalini also, as Sahaja Yoga is
increasing, is trying to rise in people; because

05:33.151 --> 05:35.389
you become the channels.

05:35.389 --> 05:49.160
Wherever you go, you generate vibrations,
and these vibrations give a challenge to the

05:49.160 --> 05:56.169
Kundalini, or a message, and in various people
it rises.

05:56.169 --> 06:02.389
It may not rise up to the Sahastrara, or it
may even rise up to Sahastrara but it falls

06:02.389 --> 06:06.169
back, because there’s no recognition.

06:06.169 --> 06:13.139
So every time they do something, this Kundalini
comes up and gives them a pressure, because

06:13.139 --> 06:18.879
their Sahastrara is not open.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.319
It’s a closed door.

06:20.319 --> 06:26.729
Because of the closed door this gives them
a kind of a pressure in the head, which they

06:26.729 --> 06:31.400
don’t understand, and they call it as ‘tension’.

06:31.400 --> 06:39.050
Actually the Kundalini is trying to push it
out, itself, but it cannot.

06:39.050 --> 06:47.689
And those also who get their Realisation,
if they do not make their Sahastrara alright,

06:47.689 --> 06:51.199
they go on getting into tensions.

06:51.199 --> 07:06.349
So, though Sahastrara has been opened out
so many years back, still we have some things

07:06.349 --> 07:12.180
to be done – is to clear out our Sahastrara,
first of all.

07:12.180 --> 07:23.770
So first is the breaking of the Sahastrara,
then once it opened out, the brahmarandhra

07:23.770 --> 07:41.530
opened out, then we started feeling the grace,
and it moved onto our Ida and Pingala – the

07:41.530 --> 07:45.889
grace not the Kundalini.

07:45.889 --> 07:55.439
And the grace, which is chaitanya, all round,
soothed down our Left and Right sides by which

07:55.439 --> 08:04.669
our chakras opened more, and more threads
of the Kundalini started piercing through.

08:04.669 --> 08:11.790
So I always tell Sahaja Yogis that it’s
important that you must meditate.

08:11.790 --> 08:18.849
If your Sahastrara is alright, all your chakras
will be alright because, as you know, that

08:18.849 --> 08:26.610
the peethas, or the controlling centres of
all these chakras, are in the brain around

08:26.610 --> 08:29.530
the limbic area.

08:29.530 --> 08:39.450
So if your Sahastrara is clear everything
works out in a very different way.

08:39.450 --> 08:46.190
How to keep the Sahastrara alright, is the
big problem [which] always people ask me.

08:46.190 --> 08:48.740
You know that I reside in the Sahastrara.

08:48.740 --> 08:56.310
I have incarnated on the lotus of one thousand
petals.

08:56.310 --> 09:02.389
That’s why I could break it also.

09:02.389 --> 09:05.950
As I am today, as you see me.

09:05.950 --> 09:10.720
Of course they say, “Sahastrare Mahamaya”
(सहस्त्रारे महामाया)

09:10.720 --> 09:20.839
So this is the illusion which is all the time
there for you, which is very elusive.

09:20.839 --> 09:28.329
It had to be that way because you could not
have faced me otherwise with all the lights

09:28.329 --> 09:39.910
coming out of me or the way you saw yesterday
Sahastrara – some sort of abstract colours

09:39.910 --> 09:43.080
thrown on all sides and the lights thrown
outside.

09:43.080 --> 09:48.250
Please don’t take photographs when I’m
speaking, alright?

09:48.250 --> 09:49.250
You can take later on.

09:49.250 --> 09:50.250
There’s no hurry about.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.720
Just pay attention to My lecture.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.120
Please, pay attention.

09:55.120 --> 09:56.720
It’s important.

09:56.720 --> 10:03.580
It is to be, this, told beforehand, that nobody
should take photographs during puja because

10:03.580 --> 10:08.190
it is a very intense thing [that] one has
to work it out.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.290
Please, pay attention.

10:10.290 --> 10:14.470
Even if you don’t understand, it has effect
on you.

10:14.470 --> 10:24.250
So I would request you to pay full attention
to me when I am talking.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.450
It works better.

10:26.450 --> 10:34.339
Now this Sahastrara is to be looked after
by you.

10:34.339 --> 10:39.810
It’s the temple of your Mother.

10:39.810 --> 10:44.570
When you say you put me in the heart, actually
you put me in the Sahastrara.

10:44.570 --> 10:49.899
Because, as you know, the brahmarandhra here
(Shri Mataji touches her brahmarandhra) is

10:49.899 --> 10:57.730
the fontanel bone area, has got the peetha,
the centre, which controls the heart, which

10:57.730 --> 11:07.880
is the seat of the Sadashiva or you can say
of Shiva.

11:07.880 --> 11:13.120
So when you put me in the heart actually you
put me there.

11:13.120 --> 11:20.839
So to raise it from heart to there, or to
bring it from there to the heart, is the problem

11:20.839 --> 11:28.230
of two types of people.

11:28.230 --> 11:37.089
Some people who are sensitive in their heart
– I would say in Europe we can say Italians

11:37.089 --> 11:40.791
are very sensitive on their heart – the
first thing they do as soon as they see me

11:40.791 --> 11:48.560
they put their hands to their heart.

11:48.560 --> 11:57.320
And that is what it is, that, if you try to
feel me in your heart, to begin with, it’s

11:57.320 --> 11:59.220
much easier.

11:59.220 --> 12:02.380
To feel me in your heart.

12:02.380 --> 12:14.079
Now you might say, “How to do it?”

12:14.079 --> 12:21.090
You have to love me as I love you.

12:21.090 --> 12:29.920
You have to love each one of yourselves, because
you are all within me.

12:29.920 --> 12:35.709
And you cannot teach someone how to love.

12:35.709 --> 12:37.079
Love is within.

12:37.079 --> 12:45.360
And love manifests if, just, you open your
heart.

12:45.360 --> 12:52.029
Now what stops it, we should examine that.

12:52.029 --> 12:55.220
Firstly, the conditioning.

12:55.220 --> 13:02.769
In the West to express your love is regarded
as sinful actually.

13:02.769 --> 13:08.610
It takes them time to say, “I love you,”
but “I hate you!” even a child could go

13:08.610 --> 13:10.480
on saying, “I hate you!

13:10.480 --> 13:11.600
I hate you!

13:11.600 --> 13:12.730
I hate you!”

13:12.730 --> 13:14.680
But to hate someone is sinful.

13:14.680 --> 13:19.889
To anyone, to hate, is sinful.

13:19.889 --> 13:20.889
So to say that, “I hate you!

13:20.889 --> 13:28.980
I hate you!” is a sinful act.

13:28.980 --> 13:40.589
So what one has to do is to say, [to] go on
saying, “I love you."

13:40.589 --> 13:49.520
After all, you must love a person who is so
dear to you.

13:49.520 --> 13:58.880
Anyone who has done something good for you,
you love that person.

13:58.880 --> 14:06.160
But if the Adi Shakti Herself has given you
the rebirth, it should be the easiest thing

14:06.160 --> 14:11.230
to love.

14:11.230 --> 14:20.480
And if She says that, “They are all within
my body,” so it should be even easier to

14:20.480 --> 14:23.370
love each other.

14:23.370 --> 14:36.670
So the whole cleansing of the Sahastrara is
done through this love, this love which is

14:36.670 --> 14:49.990
not conditioned, which is not inhibited, which
doesn’t want any respite or doesn’t want

14:49.990 --> 14:54.300
any return – nirvaaj.

14:54.300 --> 14:59.699
But the conditionings are too much.

14:59.699 --> 15:08.019
First the problem of conditioning comes to
you when you think that, “This condition

15:08.019 --> 15:19.690
makes me hate someone,” or, “I cannot
love someone because this is the condition!”

15:19.690 --> 15:30.730
But actually the conditioning itself is so
absurd, if you see it one by one.

15:30.730 --> 15:42.180
To make it simple, I would like you to understand
the conditioning part where I read once an

15:42.180 --> 15:47.399
article, an interesting one, “Who killed
the romance?”

15:47.399 --> 15:50.120
So he said “the hairdressers”.

15:50.120 --> 15:56.529
I was wondering how is he connecting romance
with the hairdressers?

15:56.529 --> 16:05.110
Because people used to go to a hairdresser
and one hairdressing was liked by a person.

16:05.110 --> 16:09.180
So he would say that, “I love that hairdressing!”

16:09.180 --> 16:17.399
Now supposing his fiancée, or his wife wore
another type of hairdressing, because everyday

16:17.399 --> 16:25.700
new things are coming, then immediately the
husband would say, “Oh I hate you because

16:25.700 --> 16:29.900
of your hairdressing!”

16:29.900 --> 16:34.230
Because he loves one type of hair dress, that’s
why he loves.

16:34.230 --> 16:36.650
Otherwise if you have another hair dress you
hate it!

16:36.650 --> 16:39.480
“I don’t like it!”

16:39.480 --> 16:47.100
To say that “I don’t like it” and “I
like it”, itself, is a sign that the conditioning

16:47.100 --> 16:51.720
is too much.

16:51.720 --> 16:57.370
You make a proper hair dress and you dress
up properly and you come out and then suddenly

16:57.370 --> 17:02.220
people say, ”Oh I hate it!”

17:02.220 --> 17:03.480
Who are you?

17:03.480 --> 17:07.449
What right we have got to say that to anyone?

17:07.449 --> 17:14.790
You are not a judge appointed by any law courts.

17:14.790 --> 17:24.000
So why do we say, to hurt someone, to say
“I hate it”?

17:24.000 --> 17:29.980
On the contrary you must say that, “Alright,
I like this but you could do better."

17:29.980 --> 17:38.520
That’s the sign of love when you want a
person to be dressed up in a way that is appealing.

17:38.520 --> 17:47.840
But this is on a very, very baser level that
we see people.

17:47.840 --> 17:58.539
Then we go further to see a person: how intelligent
he is, how smart he is, how charismatic he

17:58.539 --> 18:07.510
is, how charming – that’s another word
which is very elusive.

18:07.510 --> 18:13.030
These are also kind of conditionings of the
mind that you think that a particular style

18:13.030 --> 18:23.179
of a person is a loveable person, that you
love that person.

18:23.179 --> 18:26.970
It’s so much outside.

18:26.970 --> 18:31.809
Or some people actually do not love but show
they love because somebody has more money.

18:31.809 --> 18:37.340
And the money, he’s not going to part with,
no doubt, but you love that person because

18:37.340 --> 18:46.390
he has more money, or he has a better car
or he’s better dressed, whatever it is.

18:46.390 --> 18:55.770
So this kind of an idea one has also is a
killer of love.

18:55.770 --> 19:02.429
If love is killed, the joy is lost, you cannot
have joy without love.

19:02.429 --> 19:11.150
I say, joy and love, both are just the same.

19:11.150 --> 19:15.559
Then it gets even subtler and subtler and
subtler.

19:15.559 --> 19:22.710
Then we start loving our own children, that’s
very common.

19:22.710 --> 19:28.929
I mean, of course, also some people don’t
even love their children, I mean there are

19:28.929 --> 19:32.149
all kinds, you see.

19:32.149 --> 19:36.890
But then they go on, “This is my child,
this is my child, this is my child!”

19:36.890 --> 19:48.140
That again is the death of love.

19:48.140 --> 19:54.559
As I told you before: the sap of the tree
rises, goes to every fruit, goes to every

19:54.559 --> 19:57.850
leaf, goes to every part and comes back.

19:57.850 --> 19:59.320
It’s not attached.

19:59.320 --> 20:08.540
If you are attached to one part or to one
flower because it is more beautiful then the

20:08.540 --> 20:13.360
tree will die and the flower will also die.

20:13.360 --> 20:18.679
So that’s the death of the love.

20:18.679 --> 20:26.580
So you have to have love which doesn’t get
entangled or attached.

20:26.580 --> 20:28.100
Every time I tell like this they say, “How
to do it?”

20:28.100 --> 20:35.659
The love of the Spirit is of that kind.

20:35.659 --> 20:42.409
Love of conditioned mind is different.

20:42.409 --> 20:51.740
A conditioned mind can love in a limited way
because it is conditioned.

20:51.740 --> 21:02.000
Then the greatest enemy of love is ego within
us, which is like a balloon on top of our

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
head.

21:03.000 --> 21:09.429
And this ego gives us a very big tension.

21:09.429 --> 21:17.240
The conditioning of course, like they see
a carpet.

21:17.240 --> 21:22.830
Now it is, according to their conditioning,
is not good.

21:22.830 --> 21:26.170
So they say, “Oh what a carpet it is!”

21:26.170 --> 21:27.170
Or something.

21:27.170 --> 21:32.840
This kind of conditioning of very low level.

21:32.840 --> 21:37.510
And the higher level at the most, is that
you love your own country, so “My country

21:37.510 --> 21:38.510
is the best!”

21:38.510 --> 21:45.789
Whether it is killing people, whether it is
destroying the world peace, it’s all right

21:45.789 --> 21:48.500
because “I belong to a particular country
which is the best!”

21:48.500 --> 21:53.080
We can never criticise our country and countrymen.

21:53.080 --> 21:57.580
It goes on subtler and subtler.

21:57.580 --> 22:02.140
But on the intelligence side it is even worse!

22:02.140 --> 22:09.690
Because intelligently if you have understood
that something is good then nobody can save

22:09.690 --> 22:12.600
you!

22:12.600 --> 22:15.370
Because through your brain you have understood.

22:15.370 --> 22:24.380
Actually it is very surprising: I was reading
the book written by Rabindranath Tagore and

22:24.380 --> 22:35.190
an Englishman had given a very beautiful preface
to that, an introduction, and he said that

22:35.190 --> 22:40.570
the creativity is killed in the West.

22:40.570 --> 22:46.750
So he asked a gentleman who was an Indian
critic.

22:46.750 --> 22:49.560
He said, “Don’t you criticise your poets?

22:49.560 --> 22:53.460
You don’t have people who are critics?”

22:53.460 --> 22:59.590
“Yes, yes we have, they criticise,” “So
what do they criticise?”

22:59.590 --> 23:07.799
“Oh, they can criticise that, this time
there was no rain so we had problems and things."

23:07.799 --> 23:10.809
He said: “No, no, no, no!

23:10.809 --> 23:16.210
We are thinking about the poet, do they criticise
the poet, do they criticise an artist?”

23:16.210 --> 23:21.410
So he says: “Is it meant for criticism?”

23:21.410 --> 23:27.880
“It is created, whatever he felt is created.

23:27.880 --> 23:34.260
But supposing he has put something very vulgar
then of course we don’t like it.

23:34.260 --> 23:38.360
But if it is created by a beautiful mind,
it has to be beautiful."

23:38.360 --> 23:40.600
“Then you don’t criticise?”

23:40.600 --> 23:44.659
He says, “No, because we cannot create like
that.

23:44.659 --> 23:53.230
So what business have you got to criticise?”

23:53.230 --> 23:58.870
This is how, ‘intelligently’, what we
have done: we have norms about everything,

23:58.870 --> 24:01.100
about art about every creation.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.870
We don’t like this carpet.

24:02.870 --> 24:03.870
Why?

24:03.870 --> 24:11.490
Because it doesn’t appeal to our intellectual
understanding of the norms we have reached

24:11.490 --> 24:15.720
and in that frame it doesn’t fit in so we
don’t like it.

24:15.720 --> 24:22.790
Can you even create one inch of that?

24:22.790 --> 24:26.700
So this ego gives you an unauthorised action.

24:26.700 --> 24:31.740
It is unauthorised, anadhikar cheshta (नधिकार
चेष्टा).

24:31.740 --> 24:32.740
Un-authorised.

24:32.740 --> 24:37.010
You have no authority to criticise.

24:37.010 --> 24:44.440
You can’t do anything, so why should you
criticise?

24:44.440 --> 24:50.360
Better [to] appreciate and see for yourself
that you are not in authority, you are not

24:50.360 --> 24:54.659
worthy of it, to criticise.

24:54.659 --> 25:00.480
If you are not worthy of it why should you
criticise anything?

25:00.480 --> 25:09.899
And, otherwise also, you must know [that]
you are a slave of your ego.

25:09.899 --> 25:15.820
Whatever you ego dictates and your intelligence,
so-called ‘intelligence’, brings you to

25:15.820 --> 25:17.679
a point, to have some norm.

25:17.679 --> 25:23.549
And then it becomes a collective ego of a
particular community, of a particular country,

25:23.549 --> 25:25.720
of a particular ideology.

25:25.720 --> 25:27.100
It’s collective.

25:27.100 --> 25:36.549
So then they say, “Oh we think this is no
art!”

25:36.549 --> 25:44.409
That is the reason we cannot have masters
any more in art.

25:44.409 --> 25:48.169
We can’t have Rembrandt, we can’t.

25:48.169 --> 25:52.240
Poor Rembrandt must have himself suffered
a lot.

25:52.240 --> 25:54.809
You know Gauguin suffered a lot.

25:54.809 --> 25:56.930
All these artists suffered a lot.

25:56.930 --> 25:59.669
Even Michelangelo suffered a lot.

25:59.669 --> 26:06.260
Not only monetarily, not only monetarily,
but otherwise: criticise, criticise, criticise.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.789
So I think people have given up.

26:07.789 --> 26:12.600
I met an artist who had done lots of art work
and I said, “Why don’t you show me?”

26:12.600 --> 26:14.860
He said, “No I don’t want to show you.

26:14.860 --> 26:15.860
It’s created for myself."

26:15.860 --> 26:18.450
I said, “I would like to see!”

26:18.450 --> 26:23.480
I saw, it was beautiful, very beautiful, I
said, “Why don’t you show?”

26:23.480 --> 26:24.960
He said, “No use.

26:24.960 --> 26:25.960
People will just criticise.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.210
I do it for my own pleasure.

26:28.210 --> 26:36.919
They’ll just spoil the whole joy of my creation."

26:36.919 --> 26:42.640
So one of the basic things we should avoid
is to criticise others.

26:42.640 --> 26:47.490
Better to criticise yourself.

26:47.490 --> 26:53.779
Criticise yourself, criticise your brothers
and sisters, criticise your country, criticise

26:53.779 --> 27:01.220
all the habits you have and laugh at yourself,
is the best way.

27:01.220 --> 27:09.800
If you know how to laugh at yourself then
you will not object or will not stand in the

27:09.800 --> 27:13.289
way of any creativity of another person.

27:13.289 --> 27:18.000
So with ego you become so unauthorised.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.809
You can criticise anything.

27:19.809 --> 27:25.000
You think you have a right.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.390
Who has given you this right to criticise?

27:27.390 --> 27:30.960
Is the question one should ask to oneself.

27:30.960 --> 27:38.480
How can we criticise anyone?

27:38.480 --> 27:47.720
As saints, as you are now, of course, you
can make out who is caught up, who has given

27:47.720 --> 27:51.590
bad vibrations, who has the problem.

27:51.590 --> 27:53.260
You know that.

27:53.260 --> 27:54.930
You know it.

27:54.930 --> 27:56.600
It’s not conditioning.

27:56.600 --> 28:03.080
It’s not just you are doing because there’s
some ego, but you are feeling it on you fingertips.

28:03.080 --> 28:07.049
It’s an actual feeling within you.

28:07.049 --> 28:10.700
It’s the bodha (बोध: knowledge), by
which you know.

28:10.700 --> 28:14.650
Then what should you do?

28:14.650 --> 28:19.440
In your love, you have to tell the person,
if possible, that, “This is wrong with you.

28:19.440 --> 28:20.789
Better be corrected!”

28:20.789 --> 28:24.059
But in a way that he does it.

28:24.059 --> 28:27.809
On the contrary, if you tell him in a way
that he becomes even worse than what it is,

28:27.809 --> 28:30.640
you have not loved that person at all.

28:30.640 --> 28:33.320
Allow everybody to grow.

28:33.320 --> 28:47.549
There are many people in Sahaja Yoga who are
very, very good, excellent, no doubt.

28:47.549 --> 28:52.059
But also there are some people whom we can
call as very difficult; very!

28:52.059 --> 28:59.700
There’s sort of a crack in their head or
something, that part is missing sometimes.

28:59.700 --> 29:02.309
Some screws are loose I think.

29:02.309 --> 29:04.360
Sometimes they behave like clowns.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.440
And we have known some people.

29:06.440 --> 29:09.409
We just can’t help them.

29:09.409 --> 29:15.909
They could be very intelligent otherwise,
they could be very sharp otherwise, but in

29:15.909 --> 29:27.840
Sahaja Yoga they cannot come down to that
level where you can say: now the growth is

29:27.840 --> 29:30.260
possible.

29:30.260 --> 29:35.149
Supposing the Mother Earth was very hot like
the Sun, there would have been no growth.

29:35.149 --> 29:41.400
Or [if] it was cold like Moon, there would
have been no growth.

29:41.400 --> 29:50.309
It had to come to the centre where it had
both the things in proper proportions to grow.

29:50.309 --> 30:01.549
In the same way, a human being has to work
out that you keep a moderation and a balance,

30:01.549 --> 30:09.740
and understand not to go to extremes of anything.

30:09.740 --> 30:16.470
That balance you learn when you love someone.

30:16.470 --> 30:23.260
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, we have to ask
some people to leave Sahaja Yoga.

30:23.260 --> 30:33.809
This is out of love for them, because once
they go out, they improve, I have seen, they

30:33.809 --> 30:38.039
tremendously improve.

30:38.039 --> 30:46.140
But when they are inside the Sahaj Yog community
they become a nuisance, and they want to be

30:46.140 --> 30:50.750
more nuisance because their ego plays the
part, maybe the conditioning plays the part,

30:50.750 --> 30:53.419
whatever it is, they want to be a nuisance.

30:53.419 --> 30:58.059
So we have to ask them that, “Please now,
depart for a while."

30:58.059 --> 31:04.039
Now if that nuisance value is lost in a person
then he has to be straightforward.

31:04.039 --> 31:16.790
He cannot be any more a nuisance and logically
it can appeal to a person, if you tell that

31:16.790 --> 31:22.809
person, that this is the reason why we want
you to be out.

31:22.809 --> 31:28.650
But they can be very disgustingly troublesome,
I know that.

31:28.650 --> 31:36.960
But you have to show complete patience and
complete understanding and you must talk like

31:36.960 --> 31:39.559
a person who loves.

31:39.559 --> 31:51.850
Love has such a power that nobody wants to
do something that will suggest that they don’t

31:51.850 --> 31:55.470
love; very powerful thing it is.

31:55.470 --> 32:01.700
It binds people in such a beautiful manner
that one wants to do something: for example

32:01.700 --> 32:04.519
you want to give me flowers, because you know
I love flowers.

32:04.519 --> 32:09.660
So you want to give me flower to suggest that,
“Mother we love you,” Just to suggest.

32:09.660 --> 32:17.269
I know you love me but you just want to, sort
of, reinforce it, the thought in me.

32:17.269 --> 32:23.940
So you want to give me a flower to show your
love and expression of your inner feeling

32:23.940 --> 32:27.679
for me.

32:27.679 --> 32:32.519
So all these material things can be used to
express your love.

32:32.519 --> 32:39.990
They can be very easily expressed in such
a manner that another person knows what is

32:39.990 --> 32:40.990
love.

32:40.990 --> 32:45.480
But the whole power of Sahastrara is love.

32:45.480 --> 32:59.350
So, if you see that, this brain has to love;
brain has to love.

32:59.350 --> 33:07.840
After now verifying the powers of Sahaja Yoga,
through your brain and intelligence, if you

33:07.840 --> 33:14.419
reach a point where you understand that: No,
it’s no use analysing, synthesising, doing

33:14.419 --> 33:16.130
all these things.

33:16.130 --> 33:17.510
It’s just love.

33:17.510 --> 33:19.350
It’s simple love.

33:19.350 --> 33:25.980
So the same Sahastrara which has been used
before, this brain, for analysing, for criticising,

33:25.980 --> 33:32.510
for doing all kinds of nonsensical things,
now wants to love and enjoy the love.

33:32.510 --> 33:39.039
And there is the culmination where the brain
just loves.

33:39.039 --> 33:42.380
That is the situation one has to reach.

33:42.380 --> 33:43.809
It just loves.

33:43.809 --> 33:46.919
It knows only love because it has seen the
power of love.

33:46.919 --> 33:52.500
You reach a certain logical conclusion, and
then you see the point.

33:52.500 --> 33:59.010
Like Adi Shankara wrote so many things like
Vivekachudamani, this, that, and all those

33:59.010 --> 34:01.880
treaties, and then he gives up, he said, “No,
nothing!”

34:01.880 --> 34:10.490
He just writes the praise of the Mother – finished!

34:10.490 --> 34:16.220
So once you reach that point, we can say now
you are in nirvikalpa because there is no

34:16.220 --> 34:20.130
vikalpa, there is no doubt in your head; because
you love.

34:20.130 --> 34:21.680
In love you don’t doubt, no question.

34:21.680 --> 34:23.400
Only when you think you doubt.

34:23.400 --> 34:30.100
But when you love you don’t doubt, you just
love, because you enjoy love.

34:30.100 --> 34:34.810
And that’s why love is joy and joy is love.

34:34.810 --> 34:40.620
So after so many days the Sahastrara has been
opened out.

34:40.620 --> 34:48.340
We have to open out our Sahastrara again:
through our meditative processes, through

34:48.340 --> 34:51.150
understanding ourselves and others.

34:51.150 --> 34:56.150
Maybe logically reaching that point: there’s
no way out now.

34:56.150 --> 34:58.900
We have reached to the end of it now.

34:58.900 --> 35:00.820
The whole logic has ended up now.

35:00.820 --> 35:04.930
Jump in the ocean of love – finished!

35:04.930 --> 35:10.380
Once you jump into the ocean of love there’s
nothing to be done; just to be enjoyed – every

35:10.380 --> 35:19.770
wave of it, every hue of it, every touch of
it.

35:19.770 --> 35:32.000
That is what one has to learn by reasoning
that Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is love.

35:33.620 --> 35:35.620
May God bless you all.
