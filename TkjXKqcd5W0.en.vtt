00:04.894 --> 00:10.699
ADVICE ON HAMSA CHAKRA

00:22.063 --> 00:25.516
Shri Mataji: Any other question?

00:37.736 --> 00:41.436
Yogi: Mother, it seems that many of us here
don’t really know

00:41.637 --> 00:44.666
about the Hamsa Chakra…
Shri Mataji: About what?

00:44.867 --> 00:48.276
Yogi: About the Hamsa Chakra.
Shri Mataji: Hamsa Chakra.

00:48.477 --> 00:51.652
Yogi:… in terms of understanding how it
relates to the Vishuddhi

00:51.853 --> 00:57.254
and what we can do to strengthen our
Vishuddhi.

00:57.455 --> 01:00.159
Shri Mataji: Hamsa Chakra stands between
the Vishuddhi and the Agnya,

01:00.360 --> 01:03.250
as you can see clearly, positioned like
that.

01:03.451 --> 01:08.517
But from Vishuddhi there are many nerves
which pass through Hamsas

01:08.718 --> 01:12.488
and end up here. They don’t all go
to the brain.

01:12.689 --> 01:19.976
Or we can say that at this time, at this
point, all our reactions

01:20.177 --> 01:25.726
which are what you call reflex reactions
finish off.

01:27.865 --> 01:34.815
So supposing now I get some dirty smell,
I’ll close My nose like that,

01:35.016 --> 01:38.889
or if I can’t hear, I’ll just pull My ears
like this;

01:39.090 --> 01:43.463
or if I see something dirty, or if I see
something jarring,

01:43.664 --> 01:45.487
My eyes will close automatically.

01:45.688 --> 01:49.203
If somebody tries to put a pin through Me,
immediately I’ll …

01:49.404 --> 01:53.882
spontaneously, it’s all built in, within
My system,

01:54.083 --> 01:59.621
and your system, too, that you react with
reflex action.

01:59.806 --> 02:03.147
Same thing may not happen to animals.
Animals are different.

02:03.348 --> 02:08.643
Some animals have certain reflex actions,
some have some reflex actions;

02:08.844 --> 02:11.727
but we are different and our reflex actions

02:11.928 --> 02:17.138
we are all practically just the same.
There’s not much individuality.

02:17.339 --> 02:21.198
There isn’t much difference in our reflex
actions.

02:21.399 --> 02:24.306
At the most, with conditioning somebody
might say “Yah!”,

02:24.507 --> 02:26.845
somebody might say “Oh!”, somebody may say
something –

02:27.046 --> 02:32.981
that’s different. But the reflex actions
are just the same.

02:33.328 --> 02:39.647
So up to the reflex action, we don’t have
to use discretion.

02:40.045 --> 02:42.660
Then starts our discretion part.

02:42.861 --> 02:48.425
As discretion starts when we are using
these two nadis which meet here,

02:48.626 --> 02:53.682
without going to the Agnya. So when these
two nadis meet here,

02:53.883 --> 03:02.080
what happens we start seeing through our
experiences.

03:03.007 --> 03:06.428
First would be a reflex action, automatic
reflex action.

03:06.629 --> 03:10.576
The second is when, supposing a child,
if you tell the child,

03:10.777 --> 03:15.074
“Now this is hot; don’t put your hand
there”, he won’t listen. Put the child.

03:15.275 --> 03:20.262
With experience, he will develop reflex
actions, the conditionings of it.

03:20.463 --> 03:23.385
So thus reflexes are built in within us.

03:23.586 --> 03:29.174
Also, they are built in within us with, we
should say,

03:29.375 --> 03:38.073
with other conditionings like, you see,
in a country supposing there’s racialism,

03:38.274 --> 03:41.504
or in a country like ours there’s a caste
system.

03:41.689 --> 03:46.952
Then person react according to what they
have learned from childhood.

03:47.153 --> 03:52.619
All these conditionings could be
of the present day, when you are born.

03:52.820 --> 03:58.856
You could have been, yourself, born in last
life in, say, Africa.

03:59.057 --> 04:01.391
Today you are born with a white skin,

04:01.592 --> 04:06.285
so you have started sort of calling that
African you have become.

04:06.486 --> 04:11.566
All these conditionings can be built in,
into your Hamsa Chakra,

04:11.767 --> 04:15.049
which have come from your

04:15.250 --> 04:18.505
training of the mind, you can say
the experiences of the mind,

04:18.706 --> 04:24.574
the experiences of the society, of your
knowledge, of your education,

04:24.775 --> 04:31.489
the way you are conditioned can be built
in here – in the Hamsa Chakra.

04:31.690 --> 04:36.348
And it reacts to things which has no
meaning.

04:36.549 --> 04:39.639
If you wear … “I hate someone!” Why?

04:39.840 --> 04:44.677
Because that person wears a blue jean,
or something;

04:44.878 --> 04:50.314
or you can say a green shirt. Now this is
built in your mind.

04:50.515 --> 04:55.346
Or sometimes this falling in love, also,
comes from the same kind of a conditioning.

04:55.547 --> 05:02.515
Supposing you had met somebody who had,
say, blue eyes and was kind to you.

05:02.716 --> 05:06.179
So you have fascination for a person who
has blue eyes.

05:06.380 --> 05:12.704
There’s no pure idea about beauty; there’s
no pure idea of happiness;

05:12.905 --> 05:19.966
there’s no pure idea of aesthetics.
All is condition.

05:20.167 --> 05:24.996
For some people, this is beautiful; for
somebody, this is not beautiful.

05:25.197 --> 05:29.373
So this is the place where these
interchanges take place

05:29.574 --> 05:40.076
between both the nadis, and here the Hamsa
lies outside the path of Kundalini.

05:40.277 --> 05:47.879
They sort of come out here, out of the path
of Kundalini. It’s very surprising.

05:48.080 --> 05:53.797
When the Kundalini moves, She goes from
Vishuddhi direct to Agnya.

05:53.998 --> 06:01.117
Now, how can we improve our Hamsa then?
It’s a big problem,

06:01.335 --> 06:05.859
because if our Hamsa is sick, is over-
conditioned.

06:06.060 --> 06:10.995
The Kundalini cannot work on it; it just
gives up.

06:11.196 --> 06:18.622
Now, so for Hamsa we use all these physical
things.

06:18.823 --> 06:24.132
Like I said, put the ghee in the nose.
Keep it in a way

06:24.333 --> 06:27.629
that it is nourished properly.

06:27.830 --> 06:32.486
Because Kundalini, if it tries to too much
attack the Hamsa, it will have problem.

06:32.687 --> 06:38.344
Problem because, as it is most of our time
we spend in such a manner

06:38.545 --> 06:44.112
that your Hamsa things become –

06:44.313 --> 06:48.613
what you call the epithelial cells,
the linings – become dried out.

06:48.814 --> 06:53.960
When the Kundalini rises, She may

06:54.577 --> 07:01.849
try to create a problem more for that
dryness – maybe.

07:02.050 --> 07:06.829
So it is kept out, but it has an effect
in the sense

07:07.030 --> 07:13.454
that even if there is a light outside,
it can fall inside.

07:13.655 --> 07:18.854
So it’s not the Kundalini directly that
affects your Hamsa.

07:19.055 --> 07:28.068
It is like when the Kundalini awakens, you
yourself see now

07:28.269 --> 07:33.927
that a person is, whether he is fair
complexion or dark complexion,

07:34.128 --> 07:40.731
he is a human being. You reason it out
and Hamsa clears out.

07:41.939 --> 07:48.613
Then you see yourself that, “Oh, I’m very
egoistical.”

07:48.814 --> 07:53.651
You start seeing yourself through your
Agnya, start seeing that,

07:53.852 --> 07:59.710
“I’m so conditioned.” So you reason it out,

08:00.256 --> 08:04.223
and that’s how you correct your
conditionings.

08:04.424 --> 08:06.864
This is what is Hamsa Chakra.

08:07.065 --> 08:11.650
So Hamsa Chakra cannot be done if just
you’re a realized soul,

08:11.851 --> 08:18.929
but is an effect, is the symptom of your
Kundalini awakening.

08:19.130 --> 08:25.618
Some people think that you develop
discretion

08:26.030 --> 08:30.833
just as the Kundalini rises. Is a wrong
idea. No.

08:31.034 --> 08:36.624
That has to be deliberately seen that you
build up that discretion within yourself.

08:36.825 --> 08:42.542
But once it is built – for example
My discretion is absolute,

08:42.743 --> 08:47.898
I just know what it is. You see
My conditioning here is absolute,

08:48.099 --> 08:51.527
is one with the Kundalini, one with
reality.

08:51.728 --> 08:57.828
But for human beings, it has to be
reflected by understanding.

08:58.029 --> 09:01.156
Like a child he touches something hot,
then it is hot.

09:01.357 --> 09:03.940
Now this is hot, because it’s heated up.

09:04.141 --> 09:07.672
So you see a person is catching
on the right heart. Right.

09:07.873 --> 09:11.319
She’s catching on the right heart means
he’s got a right heart,

09:11.520 --> 09:17.455
and he is suffering from such and such
thing. You have to see it yourself.

09:17.656 --> 09:21.259
Now if you tell the person, “Are you
suffering from, say, asthma?”

09:21.460 --> 09:27.150
He said, “Yes, how do you know?” “I know it
because I’ve learned it through my finger

09:27.351 --> 09:30.232
which was burning, that’s why I know
it is.”

09:30.433 --> 09:35.346
But supposing somebody has an asthma and
in that plays the part

09:35.547 --> 09:41.483
your Kundalini, you will get asthma
immediately. You see the point?

09:41.721 --> 09:46.036
The conditioning cannot come to us unless
and until it passes through,

09:46.237 --> 09:50.010
or sieves through, our reasoning and
understanding.

09:50.211 --> 09:53.940
Are you understanding, Rustom, the point?

09:54.141 --> 10:03.357
It cannot work out. The reason is, it
filters your collective consciousness.

10:03.558 --> 10:06.505
Otherwise, you go near a person who has
AIDS,

10:06.706 --> 10:11.184
and you become collectively conscious that
he has AIDS.

10:11.385 --> 10:18.762
And if you imbibe all that into you as
a conditioning, you will get it.

10:20.415 --> 10:25.248
But you are separated. Like person who
reads a –

10:25.449 --> 10:29.400
there’s a very nice story about this,
Jerome has written.

10:29.601 --> 10:35.211
Like one man, he went and read Materia
Medica. Went and told doctor that,

10:35.412 --> 10:41.131
“Doctor I have all the diseases except for
one, which is housewife’s knee.

10:41.323 --> 10:46.125
He said, “How is it you haven’t got it?”
“Because I am not a housewife.”

10:46.326 --> 10:49.706
So he got conditioned into all
the diseases.

10:49.907 --> 10:52.523
That’s how many people get diseases,

10:52.724 --> 10:55.876
but thank God there’s a filter.

10:56.077 --> 11:02.130
If somebody has a disease, you don’t get
it, because you can filter it.

11:02.532 --> 11:06.964
But Hamsa Chakra could be affected
by baddhas.

11:07.165 --> 11:12.677
That’s one problem, if some baddha passes
through the nose, you might;

11:12.878 --> 11:15.772
some viruses pass through the nose, you
might.

11:15.973 --> 11:19.927
Affected, means it can get sick.

11:20.128 --> 11:24.830
But one must understand the discrimination
between the two.

11:25.031 --> 11:32.119
Say there’s a virus infection outside.
It can pass into your

11:34.377 --> 11:40.873
Hamsa Chakra and can give you a problem
of sinus, this, that – physical.

11:41.323 --> 11:46.925
But you won’t become like a person who has
given you virus infection.

11:47.126 --> 11:56.637
So there is a filter. But supposing there’s
a person who is very hectic.

11:56.838 --> 12:00.775
And you come in contact with that person –
he’s very hectic,

12:00.976 --> 12:07.531
so your Swadisthana can take over. You can
become hectic with that person.

12:07.732 --> 12:10.699
Being with that person, you can become
hectic.

12:10.900 --> 12:14.789
But as far as the Hamsa is concerned,
with anybody you live,

12:14.990 --> 12:21.034
your Hamsa doesn’t carry the complete
impact of that because there’s filter.

12:21.235 --> 12:24.488
So now, if you have to develop
the discretion,

12:24.689 --> 12:33.022
you have to learn, you have to understand.
It doesn’t come automatically.

12:34.895 --> 12:38.623
But with children who are born realized,
their Hamsa is so developed

12:38.824 --> 12:43.537
that they know it – what is right, what is
wrong.

12:43.738 --> 12:47.805
Because their Hamsa is so much trained
that way,

12:48.006 --> 12:53.010
they don’t have to use much understanding.
But those who are now growing up,

12:53.211 --> 13:03.251
have become now Sahaja Yogis have to know
through their own experiences their Hamsa.

13:05.031 --> 13:11.433
Is a filter, also. But for a child, he
knows what is right, what is wrong,

13:11.634 --> 13:14.846
because his Hamsa is developed.

13:15.047 --> 13:18.344
In India, when the child is born he’s
massaged nicely.

13:18.545 --> 13:21.281
Oiling is the best way to have a good
Hamsa.

13:21.482 --> 13:25.326
Oil his head, oil his body, put...

13:25.527 --> 13:28.008
[Hindi: "It's late... we are almost about
to finish."]

13:28.216 --> 13:33.238
put some drops in the nose, everything.

13:36.016 --> 13:41.844
They try, in the ear, in the nose and
that’s how they build up.

13:46.124 --> 13:50.535
So what I have to say that physically you
should help your Hamsa Chakra

13:50.736 --> 13:58.694
by using ghee and all that, and mentally
you should use it by learning things,

13:58.895 --> 14:06.198
in experience – what to do, how to do it,
how to work it out, how to establish.

14:06.399 --> 14:16.893
[Hindi: "Sit, sit... settle down. Sit
relaxed."]

14:17.806 --> 14:22.988
That is how Hamsa Chakra grows and makes
you discrete.

14:23.204 --> 14:27.130
That’s why a tradition is very important.

14:27.331 --> 14:30.854
Tradition gives you the growth of the Hamsa
Chakra

14:31.055 --> 14:37.072
and then you go on discarding whatever is
wrong out of that tradition.

14:37.273 --> 14:41.832
Then again, you keep whatever is good.
Give it to your children -

14:42.001 --> 14:46.404
to your children - to your children. So
the discretion comes

14:46.589 --> 14:56.434
to a person who is traditionally built up
better than a person who has no traditions.

14:59.142 --> 15:02.732
Now, for example, this morning I was
discussing that

15:02.933 --> 15:10.188
people take, fill the wash basin and wash
their face, in the West.

15:10.389 --> 15:13.826
In India, we cannot conceive it, cannot
even think of it.

15:14.027 --> 15:18.435
I mean, people don’t know it can be done.
Because in traditional way

15:18.636 --> 15:25.666
it has come out that if you’re washing your
face and again the water goes into there,

15:25.867 --> 15:28.744
then all the dirt is in it, again you’re
using the same water.

15:28.945 --> 15:32.319
So you cannot have complete. So always use
running water.

15:32.520 --> 15:36.885
Traditionally we’ve learned it. So it’s so
much in our heads,

15:37.086 --> 15:42.984
in our discretion, that we cannot even
think of such a thing.

15:44.043 --> 15:47.090
Simple thing that Mooladhara must be
cleaned and washed.

15:47.291 --> 15:49.322
Any Indian, you take it, he knows that is,

15:49.523 --> 15:54.015
because they must have had some problems
before.

15:54.216 --> 15:59.997
Whether he is in the North, he’s in
the South, East or West – ask any Indian.

16:00.198 --> 16:03.964
Auspiciousness is another thing.

16:04.851 --> 16:10.967
It’s so much imbibed in the tradition. But
if you have a tradition, say,

16:11.168 --> 16:17.487
of doing things which are absurd – also you
can have traditions like that.

16:17.688 --> 16:22.332
Like very primitive people have all kinds
of traditions which are very absurd.

16:22.533 --> 16:26.826
I was told that if you go to Ladakh what
they do, somebody dies,

16:27.027 --> 16:33.489
they keep the hand of the dead person
in the house all the time like that.

16:33.690 --> 16:37.875
They think that that helps. But
with tradition which is wrong,

16:38.076 --> 16:41.048
by discarding that, they will understand
is wrong.

16:41.249 --> 16:49.283
So the more traditional you are,
the ancient you are, you learn many things.

16:49.484 --> 16:52.395
Like we have seen English are, in a way,
traditional,

16:52.596 --> 16:57.298
so they – supposing there’s a lady coming
down

16:57.499 --> 17:01.375
and you are coming with the lady, then
the man will be in front –

17:01.552 --> 17:04.849
automatically. He’ll just move.

17:05.050 --> 17:09.499
But if she’s going up, then man will follow
her. Just happens,

17:09.715 --> 17:12.287
automatically, because traditionally they
have learned

17:12.488 --> 17:16.120
that if you’re going down, the lady may
fall or something,

17:16.297 --> 17:19.472
so we should be in front. So what you call

17:19.673 --> 17:25.585
as the traditional habits of person gives
you this Hamsa.

17:25.786 --> 17:27.939
And these habits are built better and
better

17:28.140 --> 17:32.312
with trial and error methods. And that’s
how you develop it.

17:32.513 --> 17:36.034
Now for people who are Sahaj Yogis, it’s
much easy to imbibe them,

17:36.235 --> 17:39.514
because if you see something, “Yes, that’s
wrong – should not do it – finished.”

17:39.715 --> 17:43.134
But you should be so clear cut about it and
should determine.

17:43.335 --> 17:46.222
It works out. You’re Hamsa will be
all right.

17:46.423 --> 17:49.575
But you tell them ten times, still they do
the same thing.

17:49.776 --> 17:55.716
Then that means their Hamsa is not willing
to accept.

17:59.440 --> 18:02.908
But you must nourish it, you must look
after it, you must –

18:03.109 --> 18:06.577
as I said also this kajal is also very good
for Hamsa Chakra.

18:06.778 --> 18:15.277
All kajal and the oil in the nose, ears –
it’s very good.

18:15.478 --> 18:17.546
All acts for that.

18:17.747 --> 18:28.821
Even, say, talking to another person,
to talk discretely

18:29.022 --> 18:37.336
is to say something which doesn’t lose
its power of affecting that person.

18:37.537 --> 18:40.164
Like if you say something very harsh,

18:40.365 --> 18:45.329
then you should know how to neutralize it
so that he retains that into himself.

18:45.530 --> 18:52.908
All these discretions only come also
by tradition.

18:56.241 --> 19:03.542
When you find something that is futile, in
a collective way in a tradition drops out.

19:04.209 --> 19:08.269
So the blessings of the tradition is great,

19:08.470 --> 19:14.490
but greater are the blessings of your
Spirit.

19:15.262 --> 19:17.863
And the blessings of the Spirit are such

19:18.064 --> 19:21.639
that through your vibrations, immediately
you know this is wrong.

19:21.840 --> 19:24.819
But you have to be honest about it and just
give up.

19:25.020 --> 19:27.855
You want to ascend, you want to improve
your vibrations,

19:28.056 --> 19:32.140
so for that whatever is needed you will do.
