1
00:00:00,011 --> 00:00:01,412
Seminar in Mill Farm – Sherborne, Dorset (UK), 2 August 1981.

2
00:00:01,474 --> 00:00:05,532
In Mahalakshmi’ s temple, which is a real temple,

3
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:08,297
where all the three deities have come out in Bombay

4
00:00:08,297 --> 00:00:11,430
where I used to live very close to that place,

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,118
just imagine, and this is very common.

6
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:20,962
So to understand how human beings reacted to that

7
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:23,690
is very well shown in Delphi.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,859
It’s a beautiful thing is so done.

9
00:00:26,959 --> 00:00:30,315
But I was amazed at the Temple of Athena when we went there.

10
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:33,643
It’s so much so near to the thing that

11
00:00:33,643 --> 00:00:38,299
the Mooladhara is shown there where the Kundalini exists.

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,682
Now She is the one who has snakes around Her, see?

13
00:00:41,682 --> 00:00:45,002
And She has little, little snakes as Her children. Can you imagine?

14
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:48,438
And She is one, and She has a daughter,

15
00:00:48,438 --> 00:00:54,833
which is the Kundalini in you and a God who is a child God.

16
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:58,341
And when She stands She has a Kundalini in her hand,

17
00:00:58,341 --> 00:01:02,116
the snake coming out of Her hand. With all the charkas, she is made.

18
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:04,529
It’s so beautifully shown.

19
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:07,754
The best was Her Sanctum Sanctorum

20
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:10,846
where nobody is allowed to go inside where She resides,

21
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,243
is the Adi Kundalini.

22
00:01:13,275 --> 00:01:21,513
But they say that She came out of the head of Zeus,

23
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:26,874
the Primordial Kundalini. And Her place nobody can go inside,

24
00:01:26,874 --> 00:01:31,133
nobody can reach except for Her son, the child son.

25
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:34,477
But Her,

26
00:01:34,477 --> 00:01:37,914
Her steps are very large

27
00:01:37,914 --> 00:01:41,842
also are roundish. She curved. Can you imagine?

28
00:01:41,842 --> 00:01:45,876
They’re curved as if part of the Kundalas they are.

29
00:01:45,876 --> 00:01:53,566
And they are 3 ½ in height,

30
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:57,602
you can see that, in height and in width also.

31
00:01:57,602 --> 00:02:00,491
Like every place is made of big,

32
00:02:00,692 --> 00:02:03,825
I mean the three are made of big stones and the last one

33
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:08,188
is made of the small, three and a half, and they go in a curve.

34
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:13,553
And that is Sanctum Sanctorum nobody can go inside.

35
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:18,991
Now what an expression it was. This was the early Expression

36
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:22,586
and Athens is after Her name Athena.

37
00:02:22,586 --> 00:02:26,715
If you see the face also you will find your Mother very much there.

38
00:02:26,715 --> 00:02:29,532
I’ve got the photographs and all that which I will show you later on.

39
00:02:29,532 --> 00:02:32,747
But what I’m saying the Mother Earth has done Her job.

40
00:02:32,747 --> 00:02:39,548
People have done their job. Christ or we can say Mohammed

41
00:02:39,548 --> 00:02:45,207
or Buddha, Kabira, anyone of them;

42
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:49,219
they have done their jobs, alright. They have worked for you.

43
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:52,743
They have created places within you. They have done their job.

44
00:02:52,743 --> 00:02:58,460
Now it is you who are on the stage, not Me.

45
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,769
Sahastrara has to work it out.

46
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,928
And Sahastrara always surrounds the heart.

47
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:16,666
You are enlightened by your Spirit, which resides in your heart.

48
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:24,033
And the whole Sahastrara’s mandalas are around the heart.

49
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:35,871
So as you are now the temple of that Spirit,

50
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:38,589
you are the heart.

51
00:03:38,589 --> 00:03:42,454
You have to be very, very assiduous.

52
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:48,542
This is the fourth point, which is again against all Englishmen.

53
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:52,827
They are holidaying permanently.

54
00:03:52,827 --> 00:03:56,073
The whole attention is in holidays.

55
00:03:56,073 --> 00:04:00,906
At the slightest pretext, they are on a holiday.

56
00:04:01,597 --> 00:04:06,946
The word holiday comes from the word holy day,

57
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:12,231
is to do something holy on that day.

58
00:04:12,231 --> 00:04:19,028
God took his leave from the whole world for one day

59
00:04:19,028 --> 00:04:21,782
to cleanse Himself and to be in a holy condition.

60
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:24,274
Because you see when you clear other people,

61
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:27,520
when you create something,

62
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,987
then you want to have some time to yourself and to enjoy yourself.

63
00:04:31,987 --> 00:04:34,566
That’s why He got this holiday.

64
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:41,182
Here it is permanent holiday not holy day, holly means hollow.

65
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:43,682
It’s hollow day.

66
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:47,055
And this madness of holiday

67
00:04:47,055 --> 00:04:52,173
is of course I am working out on my level to cut it down.

68
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:59,452
This is the time one has to really get into Sahaja Yoga,

69
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:06,524
to work hard, is the time to give up all your lethargies.

70
00:05:09,785 --> 00:05:14,277
You have to get out of your sleep.

71
00:05:14,277 --> 00:05:17,301
I have seen people – I’ve told, she asked Me that,

72
00:05:17,301 --> 00:05:19,704
“Mother we would like to have your puja”. I said, “I know

73
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:24,157
why you want to have puja is good because puja means flooding.”

74
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:29,101
The floods come in, ah everybody feels fine.

75
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:33,117
Some feel fine for a month, some for a week,

76
00:05:33,117 --> 00:05:35,871
some for a day, some for an hour.

77
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:39,879
Again, as it is.

78
00:05:45,593 --> 00:05:50,822
Because with flooding

79
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:54,108
you feel the water has come inside.

80
00:05:54,108 --> 00:05:58,036
But it should be needed; there should be some depth.

81
00:05:58,036 --> 00:06:04,298
That is not done. Every Sahaja Yogi must do it every day,

82
00:06:04,298 --> 00:06:07,986
is a part of his life.

83
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:12,740
Cleansing is a part of his life. Is just like brushing his teeth.

84
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,431
Even if he does not brush his teeth does not matter.

85
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:22,723
I do not brush My teeth every night. You might have noticed it.

86
00:06:22,723 --> 00:06:27,921
I need not brush. My teeth are still solid and I was asking My husband,

87
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:31,596
“When do the human beings lose their teeth?”

88
00:06:31,596 --> 00:06:36,168
He said, “You have already passed that age.”

89
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:39,597
I said, “That means I will never lose My teeth?”

90
00:06:39,597 --> 00:06:43,060
He said, “May not.” But I never brush My teeth in the night

91
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,869
before sleeping as you people religiously do.

92
00:06:49,655 --> 00:06:53,143
The most important thing is cleansing yourself every night.

93
00:06:53,143 --> 00:06:58,096
Whether you cleanse it with water or rub it yourself with salt

94
00:06:58,096 --> 00:07:07,015
or with butter or you do the tratrika, with the flame,

95
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:09,229
do what you like

96
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:12,825
but you have to pay attention to your cleansing every night.

97
00:07:12,825 --> 00:07:17,011
And morning time you have to surrender

98
00:07:17,011 --> 00:07:19,210
before doing anything else.

99
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,409
You have to get up early? All right get up early.

100
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:31,393
Do what you like but you have to work hard.

101
00:07:31,956 --> 00:07:38,482
And you have to think every day what have I done for Sahaja Yoga today?

102
00:07:43,482 --> 00:07:46,869
It’s not the same cycle we are going to start you see.

103
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:51,115
Once you have denied materialism you became hippies,

104
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:54,072
now after coming out of that we are not going to start

105
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:58,163
the same cycle of materialism.

106
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:05,812
This is a new way where we have to go,

107
00:08:05,812 --> 00:08:09,375
where we understand our detachments from things.

108
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:12,625
It’s all right.

109
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:15,070
We are not going to run away from matter

110
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,308
but we are going to master it. If we get it well and good

111
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:20,816
if we don’t get it well and good, it’s just the same,

112
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:24,554
makes no difference.

113
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:31,613
And hard work is needed now, real hard work I tell you

114
00:08:31,613 --> 00:08:33,581
because now I’m going to America.

115
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:36,351
When I am there, there is so much of lethargy;

116
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:41,296
when I don’t allow you to sleep after 6 o’clock even if you try.

117
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:44,280
I’ve done that if you notice,

118
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,202
rather difficult for people to sleep after six.

119
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:54,090
But, still,

120
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,067
when I go away you have to really work very hard

121
00:08:57,067 --> 00:08:59,661
and keep yourself clean every day

122
00:08:59,661 --> 00:09:02,677
and write it down on a piece of paper.

123
00:09:02,677 --> 00:09:07,344
By the time I come back again I find all my horses.

124
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:11,814
That’s not going to be this time.

125
00:09:11,814 --> 00:09:14,544
Today you have to promise Me that,

126
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:17,346
that all of you are going to work very hard,

127
00:09:17,346 --> 00:09:20,954
cleanse yourself completely. Go all out.

128
00:09:20,954 --> 00:09:25,660
After all, this country is not so big to travel.

129
00:09:26,605 --> 00:09:31,151
It makes a big impressive. You have seen Australian Times.

130
00:09:31,151 --> 00:09:36,492
I had only one Sahaja Yogi with me thank God, that was Mr. Regis.

131
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:41,168
I was only controlling him. Only one horse I had to control

132
00:09:41,168 --> 00:09:44,255
and he was all right. He behaved very well,

133
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:46,358
otherwise he could have gone off you know.

134
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:49,747
Anything is possible under the sun.

135
00:09:49,747 --> 00:09:53,729
But he behaved very well. He was quite under control

136
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:56,549
and they were impressed by his presence there

137
00:09:56,549 --> 00:10:00,688
and they called him serene. Imagine Regis very serene.

138
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:03,116
And he was very sweet I must say

139
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:06,164
and he explained to them very well because he is well educated,

140
00:10:06,164 --> 00:10:08,640
he is a doctor.

141
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,176
Today I played a trick on him though, I’m sorry for that.

142
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:15,814
It was too much, whatever it is,

143
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:20,501
but he, it worked out and he’s done it well.

144
00:10:20,501 --> 00:10:24,358
In the same way it is you people I have seen it

145
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:26,455
and said it again and again,

146
00:10:26,455 --> 00:10:30,915
that you are the people who are going to

147
00:10:30,915 --> 00:10:33,725
bring Sahaja Yoga on this earth.

148
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:39,604
You are the people who are going to do it. I am nothing.

149
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:50,284
You see now when there is waterfall,

150
00:10:50,284 --> 00:10:55,101
what energy do you see? Nothing, it’s just a waterfall.

151
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,415
But when you put it to turbines

152
00:10:59,415 --> 00:11:03,208
and take out that electricity from the turbines

153
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:08,938
and then you see them here then you say, "yes there is electricity".

154
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:17,538
Whatever is potential has no meaning.

155
00:11:17,538 --> 00:11:24,165
Whatever is kinetic, whatever is showing has a meaning.

156
00:11:24,165 --> 00:11:28,104
And so it is for you

157
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:32,728
to be the showpieces of Sahaja Yoga, not Me.

158
00:11:32,728 --> 00:11:35,291
Because some will say

159
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,939
that, “Oh you may be, so what,

160
00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:40,502
you are a different clan altogether.”

161
00:11:40,502 --> 00:11:45,590
Some may say that,

162
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,922
“Oh we can’t believe you.”

163
00:11:47,922 --> 00:11:51,239
But they will believe you much more they will believe Me.

164
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:56,049
They will not believe Me at all. They’ll say I’m fantastic.

165
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,680
I, I cannot be understood, you see?

166
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,767
So they won’t believe Me, they will believe you.

167
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:06,354
They will not trust Me, but they will trust you.

168
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:09,155
They would not trust Christ but they will trust you

169
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:13,315
because you are one of them.

170
00:12:15,244 --> 00:12:19,113
That is why it is important that you should improve

171
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:26,074
in all sincerity, in all truthfulness to yourself.

172
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:31,955
Become a perfect mechanism of God.

173
00:12:31,955 --> 00:12:34,582
No reservations, should be no reservation.

174
00:12:34,582 --> 00:12:38,827
You see thinking, “All right, if I do this much

175
00:12:38,827 --> 00:12:42,065
then it’s all right, then I come back.”

176
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:44,145
This is not all out effort.

177
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:48,145
It seems to be very common you see, ‘cutting corners’ as they say.

178
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:52,156
“Oh this much, all right, should I do this much

179
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:54,418
or should I do this much?”

180
00:12:54,418 --> 00:12:57,386
I’ve seen very much discretion is used for all these things.

181
00:12:57,386 --> 00:13:02,878
It’s typical you see, “How many people so how many sandwiches?

182
00:13:02,878 --> 00:13:05,302
They will eat at the most two or three

183
00:13:05,302 --> 00:13:09,013
what’s the use of making more? So but everybody will not eat three

184
00:13:09,013 --> 00:13:13,552
so make it say two is all right, somebody will eat one.”

185
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:16,552
These calculations, see?

186
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:21,151
Who will eat one? The one who is calculating should not eat at all,

187
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:24,647
then that’s the best way.

188
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:27,886
But it’s all this calculations starts in the mind, you see,

189
00:13:27,886 --> 00:13:31,520
and these calculations ruin you.

190
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:38,220
It’s a very tricky path. I know it’s very tricky.

191
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:45,546
But you have beacons before you. Really I tell you, ‘lit’.

192
00:13:45,747 --> 00:13:47,990
Nobody had that.

193
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,831
And you have got the torches in your hand.

194
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:56,651
And you have a balancing way automatically in built.

195
00:13:56,651 --> 00:14:01,952
Just trust in all those things, and if you walk straight forward,

196
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:06,192
straight forward, forget all that is past,

197
00:14:06,192 --> 00:14:11,081
all that is nonsensical. Forget it, you are a different person.

198
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:14,668
I’m sure you’ll rise very fast.

199
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:20,768
And you will be really a living, organized being.

200
00:14:20,768 --> 00:14:26,278
All of you put together. Living, organized.

201
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:30,405
These two are not complimentary ever.

202
00:14:30,405 --> 00:14:34,001
Because living is always disorganized,

203
00:14:34,072 --> 00:14:36,342
according to human concept like

204
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,550
they will say that this flower comes out this way t

205
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,786
hat should come out that way. That human being’s thinking

206
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:45,833
but God thinks that this is the wayit is organized.

207
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:52,293
So, living organized means organized in the will of God.

208
00:14:53,772 --> 00:15:00,669
That’s how Sahaja Yogi are going to form that nucleus,

209
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:07,169
that great nucleus, that powerful nucleus,

210
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:13,312
that tremendous source

211
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:18,621
which is going to overthrow all that is nonsensical.

212
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:24,208
It is tremendous, believe Me.

213
00:15:25,421 --> 00:15:29,730
May God bless you
