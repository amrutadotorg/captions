00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:10.757
Today we have gathered here to do the puja of the Devi

00:03:14.877 --> 00:03:20.917
The Devi has many forms but

00:03:21.037 --> 00:03:26.103
is the embodiment of the shakti.

00:03:26.223 --> 00:03:34.157
Adishakti gives shakti to all these embodiments.

00:03:34.277 --> 00:03:41.077
And so there are many Goddesses we have at different times.

00:03:41.197 --> 00:03:45.427
They came on this earth and did

00:03:45.547 --> 00:03:53.637
all that was necessary for the ascent of people who were seekers.

00:03:53.757 --> 00:04:03.437
Specially the one we know of Jagadamba, the Durga.

00:04:03.557 --> 00:04:11.957
She was trying to protect all the seekers of truth

00:04:12.077 --> 00:04:17.757
and to destroy all evil forces.

00:04:20.397 --> 00:04:27.117
Because without the ascent of human beings,

00:04:27.237 --> 00:04:30.731
they do not know the truth.

00:04:30.957 --> 00:04:35.557
And that's why whatever they try to do

00:04:35.677 --> 00:04:40.637
is a mental projection. And this mental projection,

00:04:40.757 --> 00:04:48.477
if it is not substantiated by truth, by dharma, it declines.

00:04:49.837 --> 00:04:52.957
In Sanskrit they call it 'glaani'.

00:04:53.077 --> 00:04:56.877
When this glaani takes place

00:05:00.477 --> 00:05:06.957
then incarnations are born to solve the problem.

00:05:10.437 --> 00:05:18.637
In all incarnations of the Goddess, there have been,

00:05:18.757 --> 00:05:22.877
very much incarnated the satanic forces.

00:05:22.997 --> 00:05:29.597
They had incarnated and She had to fight them, with them

00:05:29.877 --> 00:05:32.077
and destroy them.

00:05:33.477 --> 00:05:39.077
But this destruction was not for the destruction sake that

00:05:39.197 --> 00:05:42.517
the evil forces are to be destroyed

00:05:42.637 --> 00:05:48.757
but evil forces always try to put down the seekers,

00:05:48.877 --> 00:05:56.557
put down the saints, try to harm them, sometimes even destroy.

00:06:02.077 --> 00:06:10.757
All these destructive forces do not come at the same time, normally

00:06:10.877 --> 00:06:14.837
at different times. Is easy to handle

00:06:14.957 --> 00:06:20.117
but the aim of the incarnation is to save,

00:06:20.237 --> 00:06:22.877
to protect the people who are seekers

00:06:22.997 --> 00:06:26.277
because they are the most important people

00:06:26.397 --> 00:06:33.117
in the realm of spirituality. All others are nothing but dust,

00:06:33.237 --> 00:06:40.997
good for nothing, useless. If they are not seeking the truth

00:06:41.117 --> 00:06:47.077
in the eyes of God, they are just useless lives

00:06:47.197 --> 00:06:50.917
that have come and will be finished.

00:06:51.037 --> 00:06:54.373
They have no value and they have no dignity.

00:06:54.493 --> 00:06:58.917
They have no understanding of anything.

00:06:59.037 --> 00:07:06.357
So in the judgment of the divine love, we have two types of people:

00:07:06.477 --> 00:07:14.037
one who are seekers of truth and the another who are not.

00:07:14.157 --> 00:07:17.561
They may be good people. They will be nice people,

00:07:17.681 --> 00:07:21.376
they'll be doing us lot of good works: social work, this work,

00:07:21.496 --> 00:07:25.561
missionary work, every sort of work they might be doing.

00:07:25.681 --> 00:07:28.961
But if they are not seeking the truth

00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:31.717
then they do not come to that category

00:07:31.837 --> 00:07:36.055
where God has to incarnate.

00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:40.857
So try to understand the preciousness,

00:07:40.977 --> 00:07:44.597
the importance of seekers.

00:07:46.317 --> 00:07:50.437
And that's what you have been seeking.

00:07:51.237 --> 00:07:58.637
Very few persons, if you take the percentage, are seeker.

00:07:58.757 --> 00:08:06.637
Is very, very wee bit. But it's very important because, say,

00:08:06.757 --> 00:08:19.437
a one little part of gold is much more valuable

00:08:19.557 --> 00:08:27.117
than mounds of steel. In the same way, a seeker

00:08:27.237 --> 00:08:32.357
is much more valuable in the growth of spirituality.

00:08:32.477 --> 00:08:36.597
The whole universe was created,

00:08:36.717 --> 00:08:43.957
whole atmosphere was built, all the evolution took place

00:08:44.077 --> 00:08:49.077
for what? That human beings should know the truth.

00:08:51.645 --> 00:08:55.454
But in the modern atmosphere,

00:08:55.574 --> 00:08:58.653
it's a very big curse, I think the greatest evil

00:08:58.773 --> 00:09:02.037
than all the Shumbha Nishumbhas and all that,

00:09:02.157 --> 00:09:06.197
the worst of all is materialism

00:09:06.917 --> 00:09:10.637
because materialism makes you gross.

00:09:10.757 --> 00:09:13.397
In your seeking also when you are rising,

00:09:13.517 --> 00:09:21.797
subtly that materialism catches you. I have been noticing this.

00:09:23.597 --> 00:09:27.906
When people come to Sahaja Yoga, right,

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:32.997
they are going deep into themselves.

00:09:33.117 --> 00:09:37.957
They are understanding what I am saying. All the inner knowledge

00:09:38.397 --> 00:09:42.797
they want to know, what is called as Atmagyan.

00:09:42.917 --> 00:09:45.107
Atmagyan means two things:

00:09:45.227 --> 00:09:50.815
the knowledge about the spirit and knowledge about yourself.

00:09:50.935 --> 00:09:57.037
All this they find out and they know what it is.

00:09:59.357 --> 00:10:07.357
This state is the state for which people have been doing

00:10:07.477 --> 00:10:11.037
all kinds of things: going to the Himalayas,

00:10:11.157 --> 00:10:16.357
meditating in the cold without much clothes on them,

00:10:16.517 --> 00:10:20.317
living in the caves with some fruits.

00:10:21.997 --> 00:10:30.677
All kinds of tapasyas they would do because the seeking was so deep,

00:10:31.157 --> 00:10:38.877
so urgent, and they could not get out of that force of seeking.

00:10:40.397 --> 00:10:51.357
But in the modern times, materialism retards that hankering,

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:59.597
that dedication. It's maddening for people when they are seekers.

00:11:01.637 --> 00:11:09.166
I have seen before coming to Sahaja Yoga, people spend lot of money,

00:11:09.286 --> 00:11:16.837
go to various places, go to Himalayas, go to Nepal, go to Japan,

00:11:16.957 --> 00:11:20.544
all over the places they are moving.

00:11:21.467 --> 00:11:24.597
But after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:28.482
after they have become the spirits,

00:11:28.754 --> 00:11:34.638
for the growth of your new awareness

00:11:35.677 --> 00:11:38.877
the progress is retarded.

00:11:38.997 --> 00:11:44.517
Also one should understand that after so much of running about,

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:48.917
you find something so precious so you settle down with that.

00:11:49.277 --> 00:11:53.717
And you feel very satisfied about it. That part is all right.

00:11:53.837 --> 00:11:59.477
But what later? Your growth should not stop.

00:12:01.677 --> 00:12:04.397
And that stops because,

00:12:04.517 --> 00:12:08.877
because of one of the main reasons is materialism.

00:12:11.717 --> 00:12:13.677
Because of materialism,

00:12:13.797 --> 00:12:18.077
your faith in yourself is also less.

00:12:18.837 --> 00:12:24.357
Now as you have seen that the Gods prayed to the Goddess

00:12:24.477 --> 00:12:28.437
and She came and killed all the negative forces.

00:12:31.237 --> 00:12:37.117
Reason was: the earnest desire of the Gods

00:12:38.157 --> 00:12:41.677
compelled Her to take incarnation.

00:12:42.317 --> 00:12:45.797
Such sincere desire

00:12:46.717 --> 00:12:54.677
that they could not get sometimes food, even water,

00:12:54.797 --> 00:13:01.197
and they worked so hard for their ascent

00:13:01.317 --> 00:13:05.037
which was disturbed by negative forces.

00:13:06.317 --> 00:13:14.350
So their call was so from the heart,

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:19.094
so desperate and genuine and sincere

00:13:19.214 --> 00:13:24.717
that the Goddess had to take birth on this earth

00:13:24.837 --> 00:13:32.077
to save them, to protect them, to look after them.

00:13:34.437 --> 00:13:43.757
But as it is, we see once you have reached a destination,

00:13:43.997 --> 00:13:46.877
we feel now better settle down.

00:13:49.197 --> 00:13:53.917
Now, what do you - we settle down with?

00:13:56.797 --> 00:14:03.757
If after getting Realization you are complete,

00:14:04.157 --> 00:14:09.517
you are in totality, you are absolutely one with reality,

00:14:09.637 --> 00:14:12.037
there is nothing to be done.

00:14:14.957 --> 00:14:17.157
You become a saint.

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:23.797
And a saint does not need any advertisement, does not need anything.

00:14:23.917 --> 00:14:26.757
His message spreads. People see him and know

00:14:26.877 --> 00:14:29.677
he is a great saint.

00:14:29.797 --> 00:14:33.317
So many saints did not even leave their houses.

00:14:33.437 --> 00:14:36.237
Very common saying in India,

00:14:36.357 --> 00:14:38.717
"Your takiya you should not leave,"

00:14:38.837 --> 00:14:42.997
the pillow on which you are resting, you should not leave.

00:14:43.117 --> 00:14:48.877
That was a criteria of a guru. Those who have to seek

00:14:48.997 --> 00:14:53.477
should come to the gurus and should climb up,

00:14:53.597 --> 00:14:56.197
at least six seven miles up,

00:14:56.317 --> 00:14:59.067
and then the guru doesn't meet any one.

00:14:59.187 --> 00:15:01.603
He may slap you. He may hit you.

00:15:01.723 --> 00:15:05.957
He may drop you from that high mountain.

00:15:06.077 --> 00:15:11.317
He'll take your test by so many ways.

00:15:11.437 --> 00:15:15.637
Ultimately he may select one person to give Realization.

00:15:16.397 --> 00:15:20.277
So this hankering, this desperate effort

00:15:20.397 --> 00:15:24.077
was all the time there.

00:15:25.837 --> 00:15:31.317
Now so we come to Sahaja Yoga in this modern time.

00:15:33.677 --> 00:15:43.037
Sometimes I feel that not only Sahaja Yoga is very easy

00:15:43.157 --> 00:15:52.357
also it is extremely pampering. You know you have got Realization.

00:15:52.477 --> 00:15:56.957
You all know that you are better than others,

00:15:57.077 --> 00:15:59.317
that you have got rid of so many problems

00:15:59.437 --> 00:16:03.397
and that now you have become master of your own.

00:16:03.597 --> 00:16:09.837
Then the responsibility

00:16:11.397 --> 00:16:19.037
that you have towards yourself and to your fellow men reduces

00:16:19.837 --> 00:16:23.437
because you feel very satisfied with yourself.

00:16:24.877 --> 00:16:27.477
The other day some Sahaja yogini rang Me up.

00:16:27.597 --> 00:16:30.837
I mean, they ring Me up for everything.

00:16:32.237 --> 00:16:37.757
She said that, "I went to the doctor and he put radiation

00:16:37.877 --> 00:16:42.317
and they found I was pregnant so what should I do about the baby?"

00:16:42.437 --> 00:16:45.997
For such a small thing they will ask.

00:16:46.117 --> 00:16:48.677
"What should the name of our son?"

00:16:48.797 --> 00:16:51.037
"What is this?" "What is that?"

00:16:51.157 --> 00:16:55.477
I mean, I have to do much more work than any priest has to do.

00:16:56.637 --> 00:17:02.157
Little, little things they are worried about. All right,

00:17:02.677 --> 00:17:07.677
that part is all right that I have to tell you

00:17:07.797 --> 00:17:11.517
what is to be done at such a point or what should we do.

00:17:11.637 --> 00:17:14.517
If they miss the train, they will telephone to Me,

00:17:14.637 --> 00:17:17.277
"Mother, we have missed the train. Now what to do?"

00:17:17.397 --> 00:17:21.317
So I have to tell them, "All right, give them a bandhan."

00:17:21.437 --> 00:17:23.917
That also I have to tell them.

00:17:24.037 --> 00:17:30.877
Or supposing their father is sick. He has a heart trouble

00:17:30.997 --> 00:17:34.197
then they will telephone to Me, "Mother, my father is sick.

00:17:34.317 --> 00:17:36.957
He has a heart trouble. He is not a Sahaja yogi.

00:17:37.077 --> 00:17:41.317
What can You do about it?" So Mother has to put attention

00:17:41.437 --> 00:17:44.397
to his father who is not a Sahaja yogui.

00:17:46.637 --> 00:17:50.157
Small, small things they write to Me.

00:17:50.277 --> 00:17:53.717
Such small things that you can't imagine

00:17:54.437 --> 00:18:00.157
how they do not understand what I am here for.

00:18:02.357 --> 00:18:07.837
Still, I have never said that "It's a stupid thing to ask Me.

00:18:07.957 --> 00:18:11.277
You should not waste My time," never.

00:18:12.397 --> 00:18:15.277
But it is to be seen now

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:22.277
that if you do not value yourself as realized souls,

00:18:22.397 --> 00:18:25.517
you can not value My time also

00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:30.437
or what is Myself.

00:18:30.557 --> 00:18:34.797
This incarnation can be wasted completely

00:18:35.317 --> 00:18:40.237
because of this materialistic attitude.

00:18:42.957 --> 00:18:46.037
In this modern times, I don't know

00:18:46.157 --> 00:18:48.757
what's gone wrong with human beings

00:18:48.877 --> 00:18:53.957
because the most important thing in your life

00:18:54.077 --> 00:18:57.197
is to ascend and to grow.

00:18:57.437 --> 00:19:01.237
Take a big vision of the whole thing.

00:19:01.437 --> 00:19:05.437
Why this universe was created?

00:19:05.557 --> 00:19:10.677
Why you were created as human beings?

00:19:10.837 --> 00:19:15.877
What was the need to do all these things? For what is it done?

00:19:15.997 --> 00:19:20.077
If you have a very big vision of the whole thing

00:19:20.197 --> 00:19:23.837
then try to locate your position: "Where am I?!

00:19:23.957 --> 00:19:27.117
And then, "How the Divine has selected me

00:19:27.237 --> 00:19:30.717
and now I have become a Sahaja yogi?"

00:19:32.957 --> 00:19:35.797
So now, "What is my responsibility?"

00:19:36.317 --> 00:19:38.877
that one has to see.

00:19:39.997 --> 00:19:44.237
But on the contrary, I have seen people

00:19:44.717 --> 00:19:48.397
who are saying have a transfer. So they will telephone and ask,

00:19:48.517 --> 00:19:52.637
"Mother, should we take our chair or not?"

00:19:54.437 --> 00:19:58.237
That shows they have no value about themselves

00:19:58.357 --> 00:20:02.477
and no value about Me, both ways.

00:20:02.597 --> 00:20:07.037
Because they are asking such small things, such silly things

00:20:07.157 --> 00:20:10.277
that is impossible to understand how

00:20:10.397 --> 00:20:15.357
could Sahaja yogis ask such questions.

00:20:23.397 --> 00:20:29.797
The perspective we can see: the Goddess.

00:20:30.037 --> 00:20:32.757
She comes on this earth

00:20:32.877 --> 00:20:36.317
in different forms at different times

00:20:37.037 --> 00:20:41.077
to save the seekers of truth

00:20:41.637 --> 00:20:46.957
and to work out the ascent of the seekers of truth.

00:20:47.077 --> 00:20:49.717
Can you imagine?

00:20:49.837 --> 00:20:53.957
A very big difference in the incarnation

00:20:54.077 --> 00:20:59.717
of the Goddess before Kaliyuga.

00:21:00.477 --> 00:21:05.917
While now, it's a very different thing

00:21:06.037 --> 00:21:08.877
that you have come on this earth

00:21:08.997 --> 00:21:12.917
to become the Sahaja yogis.

00:21:13.037 --> 00:21:17.717
You  have to have a body, a mind,

00:21:17.837 --> 00:21:23.397
feeling everything which is just charged with spirituality,

00:21:23.517 --> 00:21:25.557
charged with your spirituality.

00:21:25.677 --> 00:21:29.717
Should be normally

00:21:29.837 --> 00:21:32.797
because how many years in the past

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:35.797
you have been seeking God.

00:21:35.917 --> 00:21:41.517
Then that came here. What a coincidence!

00:21:42.077 --> 00:21:49.877
When, what is it? When you have such a great advantage

00:21:49.997 --> 00:21:55.477
that you have come to Sahaja Yoga because of your seeking

00:21:55.597 --> 00:22:00.757
and now you have found the satisfaction out of it.

00:22:00.877 --> 00:22:06.557
What is the responsibility that you have?

00:22:11.357 --> 00:22:15.557
That the incarnation Itself has come on this earth,

00:22:15.677 --> 00:22:22.237
not only to protect you, to nourish you, and to kill the demons, no!

00:22:22.357 --> 00:22:25.077
She has come on this earth

00:22:25.197 --> 00:22:30.077
to tell you about everything that is subtler

00:22:30.197 --> 00:22:35.517
inside and to tell you what should be

00:22:35.637 --> 00:22:40.237
your relationship: should be outside as well as inside.

00:22:40.357 --> 00:22:42.557
You were never connected with truth.

00:22:42.677 --> 00:22:46.397
You were never connected with this all-pervading power.

00:22:46.517 --> 00:22:52.077
You were never connected with God Almighty.

00:22:54.077 --> 00:22:56.997
So one has to understand that,

00:22:57.117 --> 00:23:01.957
"What a great thing has happened that out of me only,

00:23:02.077 --> 00:23:04.437
this Kundalini has come out

00:23:04.557 --> 00:23:14.157
and She has touched these higher centers." How?

00:23:14.397 --> 00:23:17.677
This was not done before, no.

00:23:17.797 --> 00:23:22.517
They were just protected. They were just looked after.

00:23:22.637 --> 00:23:25.397
Nowhere it is written that "Goddess

00:23:25.517 --> 00:23:29.117
has given Realization to people" nowhere.

00:23:30.797 --> 00:23:33.317
She is responsible. She can give.

00:23:33.437 --> 00:23:36.677
One of Her names is that. Not one but at least ten names are

00:23:36.797 --> 00:23:42.997
that She gives you your nirvana, that She gives you your freedom,

00:23:43.117 --> 00:23:46.637
that She introduces you to liberty.

00:23:46.757 --> 00:23:53.157
All these things are written but what's happening now

00:23:53.277 --> 00:23:59.677
is that people have not yet been able to grasp

00:23:59.797 --> 00:24:04.917
the value of their life in the modern times.

00:24:06.557 --> 00:24:09.757
See the way people ask questions.

00:24:09.877 --> 00:24:12.837
See the way people, the inquiry is on,

00:24:12.957 --> 00:24:15.277
the way people are worried,

00:24:15.397 --> 00:24:16.957
"Now my child is big.

00:24:17.077 --> 00:24:20.117
What should I do?" What should you do?

00:24:20.237 --> 00:24:22.917
Child is big. Put him to school. Do what you like.

00:24:23.037 --> 00:24:27.797
"Mother, will you please tell where to put the child."

00:24:28.077 --> 00:24:31.797
Then you put the child."Have you seen the school, Mother?" "No, I haven't."

00:24:31.917 --> 00:24:34.077
"Then you go and inspect the school."

00:24:34.197 --> 00:24:38.517
Imagine Kali Mata doing that!

00:24:38.637 --> 00:24:42.557
She would have given two nice tight slaps, I tell you.

00:24:43.037 --> 00:24:46.877
Any body who would have said that, what do you make out of it?

00:24:48.077 --> 00:24:53.477
But to that detailed extent a Motherhood has to work out.

00:24:53.597 --> 00:24:57.197
You won't do that for your own child, I know.

00:24:58.037 --> 00:25:02.757
But when it comes to children, what are they doing?

00:25:04.517 --> 00:25:06.717
Still materialistic.

00:25:09.037 --> 00:25:14.077
Today specially it's a very great day of Dussehra.

00:25:14.677 --> 00:25:19.877
This is the day when, as you know, Ravana was burnt.

00:25:20.317 --> 00:25:23.877
Effigies of Ravana were burnt all over the place.

00:25:23.997 --> 00:25:30.357
When Shri Rama came this was done, His victory.

00:25:30.477 --> 00:25:32.077
But in His victory,

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:34.637
it was not that He made Sahaja yogis

00:25:34.757 --> 00:25:37.797
or He gave Realization, no.

00:25:38.637 --> 00:25:41.877
His victory was that He killed Ravana.

00:25:43.717 --> 00:25:47.877
That was done that time for today's preparation.

00:25:48.997 --> 00:25:53.397
For today's happening, it was done long time back

00:25:55.637 --> 00:26:02.157
that these days will come

00:26:02.277 --> 00:26:10.637
when people will have proper value system of victory of Shri Rama.

00:26:12.157 --> 00:26:14.277
But it doesn't happen.

00:26:17.797 --> 00:26:22.117
It doesn't happen. Because this incarnation

00:26:22.237 --> 00:26:28.717
of Mataji Nirmala Devi is very different, very illusive, Mahamaya.

00:26:30.797 --> 00:26:33.237
So you are left to yourself,

00:26:33.357 --> 00:26:37.877
do what you like. Whatever you like, you can do it.

00:26:38.557 --> 00:26:43.557
So they will ask Me, "Mother, we have a problem."

00:26:43.677 --> 00:26:49.157
I said, "What?" "We don't know which kind of chairs we should buy."

00:26:50.077 --> 00:26:53.917
For every small thing they will refer to Mother

00:26:54.037 --> 00:26:57.437
but for important things, never.

00:26:57.557 --> 00:27:01.557
Sort of a funny use of the whole thing has started

00:27:01.677 --> 00:27:04.637
which is so great, so important

00:27:04.757 --> 00:27:08.957
is used for something absolutely nonsensical.

00:27:10.237 --> 00:27:13.717
So see the difference between the incarnations.

00:27:13.837 --> 00:27:18.517
One incarnation comes on this earth to save the people,

00:27:18.637 --> 00:27:23.477
to bring them out of the mire of Maya.

00:27:24.837 --> 00:27:29.477
But another incarnation which has come

00:27:29.597 --> 00:27:34.037
is not only just to talk about it

00:27:34.157 --> 00:27:36.957
but to give you your Realization

00:27:37.077 --> 00:27:40.597
and then to look after your small, small things.

00:27:42.557 --> 00:27:44.997
So when this lady telephoned and asked Me,

00:27:45.117 --> 00:27:49.717
"What should I do? Please Mother, cure me."

00:27:50.917 --> 00:27:53.837
It's very different attitude.

00:27:53.957 --> 00:27:56.677
Between the bhaktas of those days

00:27:56.797 --> 00:28:00.877
and the bhaktas of today, there's a very big difference.

00:28:00.997 --> 00:28:03.917
I said, "You never asked Me

00:28:04.037 --> 00:28:06.477
when you did all that, doesn't matter.

00:28:06.597 --> 00:28:09.917
Now whatever you have done, it's better I see the child,

00:28:10.037 --> 00:28:14.517
look after the child, put the child right but you come along."

00:28:18.997 --> 00:28:24.277
But then I realized that this woman is so attached to her child.

00:28:24.397 --> 00:28:26.917
And I telephoned to the leader

00:28:27.037 --> 00:28:30.037
and he said, "It's terrible attachment.

00:28:32.517 --> 00:28:35.717
It's a terrible attachment to the child."

00:28:36.517 --> 00:28:40.557
So now from one nonsense to another nonsense.

00:28:42.317 --> 00:28:49.517
This incarnation has such variety of jobs to be done.

00:28:49.637 --> 00:28:57.197
I mean, even the 64 kalas, the 64 expertise

00:28:57.317 --> 00:29:01.477
of Shri Ganesh is not sufficient to solve this.

00:29:03.837 --> 00:29:11.277
Why is it so complicated? After giving Self- Realization,

00:29:11.397 --> 00:29:15.277
it should be a straight forward march

00:29:15.397 --> 00:29:19.757
towards your goal and towards your growth.

00:29:20.877 --> 00:29:25.357
But why is it that such a complicated nonsense

00:29:25.477 --> 00:29:28.597
is all the time bothering you?

00:29:31.717 --> 00:29:35.849
What do you want? We should ask, "Now what do you want?"

00:29:35.969 --> 00:29:38.917
"I want a child."

00:29:39.037 --> 00:29:42.837
After Sahaja Yoga, you should not want anything.

00:29:42.957 --> 00:29:46.797
"Why do you want to have a child? There are so many children.

00:29:46.917 --> 00:29:49.677
You can look after them."

00:29:52.717 --> 00:29:58.397
'I want' goes away, should go away from your mind that,

00:29:58.517 --> 00:30:08.197
"I want this and I want that." This wanting is over now.

00:30:08.397 --> 00:30:12.037
What you wanted: your Self-Realization.

00:30:12.957 --> 00:30:16.277
After that, what has happened is that now:

00:30:16.397 --> 00:30:22.357
what I want is more important and I want

00:30:22.477 --> 00:30:27.197
that you should become really detached from materialism.

00:30:27.717 --> 00:30:29.530
That doesn't mean

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:33.402
that you should become like "Hare Rama Hare Krishna" no, no, no, no.

00:30:33.522 --> 00:30:35.837
They are not detached.

00:30:35.957 --> 00:30:41.757
They are very much attached people. But detachment is a state where

00:30:41.877 --> 00:30:45.997
nothing can bind you, nothing is important,

00:30:46.117 --> 00:30:50.277
most important thing  is your spiritual ascent.

00:30:50.397 --> 00:30:56.837
Nothing can attract you more than this.

00:30:56.957 --> 00:31:02.837
This is what exactly is wanted today,

00:31:02.957 --> 00:31:06.677
that Sahaja yogis should understand.

00:31:07.637 --> 00:31:11.837
Compared to what Sahaja yogis, compared to Sahaja yogis,

00:31:11.957 --> 00:31:16.117
what people have gone through. When I read it everyday,

00:31:16.237 --> 00:31:18.717
I feel terrible.

00:31:18.837 --> 00:31:23.197
Here everything is convenience, convenient,

00:31:23.317 --> 00:31:26.757
come along, enjoy nice food, nice company,

00:31:26.877 --> 00:31:33.237
it's a festival going on. Everything is [inaudible].

00:31:33.877 --> 00:31:36.237
And if something is missing, I will be the one

00:31:36.357 --> 00:31:38.426
to tell the organizers, "What is this?

00:31:38.546 --> 00:31:42.226
You should have done this. You should have done that."

00:31:49.597 --> 00:31:58.957
Now, we come to a point where we have to understand:

00:31:59.317 --> 00:32:01.797
What do we want?

00:32:04.637 --> 00:32:09.117
What's the use of killing Shumbha Nishumbhas?

00:32:09.237 --> 00:32:14.037
What's the use of killing this catholic church? What's the use?

00:32:14.157 --> 00:32:16.477
Because you are static.

00:32:17.957 --> 00:32:21.917
You are glued in one place, no progress.

00:32:22.037 --> 00:32:25.477
So what's the use of doing all these things all the time

00:32:25.597 --> 00:32:29.197
and destroying all that negativity.

00:32:31.317 --> 00:32:35.637
What is the purpose?

00:32:35.757 --> 00:32:38.637
It's too arbitrary, everybody says, "Mother,

00:32:38.757 --> 00:32:42.637
you have given them permission. You have given them license,

00:32:42.757 --> 00:32:45.797
so now they are doing the way they are."

00:32:45.917 --> 00:32:48.197
The other day, one girl came to Me.

00:32:48.317 --> 00:32:52.477
Her child was very sick. I asked her: "Do you meditate?"

00:32:52.597 --> 00:32:54.477
She kept quiet.

00:32:55.077 --> 00:32:57.677
I said I can make out that you don't meditate

00:32:57.797 --> 00:33:00.117
because I know what it is.

00:33:01.117 --> 00:33:04.237
That you don't even meditate?

00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:10.837
So today's main thing is this is a Dussehra day

00:33:10.957 --> 00:33:13.277
when the people go,

00:33:13.397 --> 00:33:15.917
cross the boundaries of their villages

00:33:16.037 --> 00:33:20.397
and bring gold for the parents.

00:33:20.677 --> 00:33:23.397
That's the story, it is like that.

00:33:23.517 --> 00:33:25.837
Now what you have to do is to

00:33:25.957 --> 00:33:31.677
cross the limits of materialism, this nonsensical

00:33:31.797 --> 00:33:36.237
dwarfy force that is working on you

00:33:36.517 --> 00:33:43.757
and you have to transcend and bring, as I said, gold

00:33:44.477 --> 00:33:52.637
that is untarnishable thing from the borders of Sahaja yoga.

00:33:54.837 --> 00:34:00.797
How many of you really are in the field of work?

00:34:00.917 --> 00:34:04.557
How many of you are telling about this to people?

00:34:06.237 --> 00:34:09.157
What are you doing about it?

00:34:15.837 --> 00:34:21.957
Why I am talking to you and not to Indians this way

00:34:22.077 --> 00:34:27.317
because their attitude is different.

00:34:27.437 --> 00:34:31.637
Their attitude is not materialistic. It's spiritual.

00:34:32.117 --> 00:34:35.197
They want their spiritual ascent

00:34:35.357 --> 00:34:41.077
for which they suffer a lot. They go out of the way to do things

00:34:41.197 --> 00:34:50.157
just to get to that state where they could be easily surrendered.

00:34:50.917 --> 00:34:54.397
This surrender state has to come.

00:34:54.517 --> 00:34:58.677
For example, you have a problem.

00:34:59.917 --> 00:35:03.557
Say problem, you have no holidays

00:35:03.677 --> 00:35:08.157
and you want to come for Pujas, say. I'm just giving an example.

00:35:08.277 --> 00:35:13.717
Now, if you want to come to Puja, you just come.

00:35:14.317 --> 00:35:18.197
Not only you will get job but you might get promotion.

00:35:19.597 --> 00:35:22.637
But you have no faith in your ascent.

00:35:22.757 --> 00:35:29.277
You have no faith that you are the chosen one.

00:35:29.597 --> 00:35:33.837
This is what is missing because of materialism.

00:35:36.437 --> 00:35:42.837
Recently in America, we have a very great Sahaja yogi,

00:35:42.957 --> 00:35:46.117
Dave Dunphy. I told him, "Dave,

00:35:46.237 --> 00:35:49.397
you better take over as the leader of America

00:35:49.517 --> 00:35:53.797
because this gentleman is not all right and you better take over."

00:35:54.637 --> 00:35:59.837
Immediately he said, "All right Mother." Now, he lives in Honolulu.

00:35:59.957 --> 00:36:06.357
Our programs and everything are done through L.A., Los Angeles,

00:36:06.477 --> 00:36:11.117
and it looked quite strange that I should ask him

00:36:11.237 --> 00:36:14.037
to come down and work there.

00:36:16.797 --> 00:36:18.957
Now, where are we?

00:36:19.077 --> 00:36:23.557
We are the people who have been blessed

00:36:23.797 --> 00:36:28.797
with all the powers. You have been blessed.

00:36:29.077 --> 00:36:30.893
But we don't want to practice.

00:36:31.013 --> 00:36:33.520
We don't want to find out what powers we have,

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.505
worried about our own children,

00:36:35.625 --> 00:36:38.505
worried about what sari we are going to wear,

00:36:38.625 --> 00:36:41.756
or worried about who is the leader

00:36:41.876 --> 00:36:44.883
and what should we do about the leadership.

00:36:49.482 --> 00:36:52.597
All these things are not going to help us.

00:36:52.717 --> 00:36:56.973
You are not here for that. Try to understand.

00:36:57.093 --> 00:37:00.977
You are here for becoming the spirit

00:37:01.097 --> 00:37:08.277
and then to spread the light of the spirit. Nothing matters.

00:37:09.301 --> 00:37:12.873
Once you start doing that, you'll be amazed:

00:37:12.993 --> 00:37:18.429
the faith works. It's not blind faith. It's not blind faith.

00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:24.715
You don't have to tell Me even. It just works.

00:37:32.848 --> 00:37:42.557
It's a matter a few days, you might get many results

00:37:42.931 --> 00:37:48.660
of what you have been hankering after,  material,

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:54.700
superficials, you might get. But the question remains.

00:37:57.229 --> 00:38:04.957
Somebody, say, wants to dedicate his life, so called,

00:38:05.095 --> 00:38:09.504
for Sahaja Yoga. Then what do you do?

00:38:09.624 --> 00:38:12.638
What do you do if you dedicate?

00:38:13.305 --> 00:38:17.383
First thing is your faith.

00:38:17.503 --> 00:38:23.062
You must know: how is your faith into anything.

00:38:23.182 --> 00:38:28.557
You really believe in it or you do not? If you do believe in it,

00:38:28.751 --> 00:38:31.468
what have you done about it?

00:38:34.501 --> 00:38:41.686
So at this stage, you have to introspect.

00:38:42.132 --> 00:38:44.209
What are you doing?

00:38:44.329 --> 00:38:48.931
What are we to do? How far do we have to go?

00:38:49.051 --> 00:38:53.237
It's a very, very important time

00:38:53.554 --> 00:39:00.251
and you are extremely important souls here sitting down

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:07.755
but, if you don't value your own systems and yourself,

00:39:07.875 --> 00:39:11.075
why should God worry about you?

00:39:13.714 --> 00:39:17.273
Why should God try to give you ideas?

00:39:17.393 --> 00:39:22.042
Why should He try to take any interest even in you

00:39:22.162 --> 00:39:24.281
persons of that [kind].

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:35.363
So now, I have to just tell you that on this day of this Puja,

00:39:35.483 --> 00:39:39.831
it's such a combination that it is the Dussehra I am here,

00:39:39.951 --> 00:39:45.488
and also is the now we can call it, the last day of the Devi Puja.

00:39:45.608 --> 00:39:49.880
We have to see within ourselves, introspect:

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.493
"What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?"

00:39:57.765 --> 00:40:00.110
Except for looking after my children,

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:04.307
cooking for the husband, that's all?

00:40:06.298 --> 00:40:10.703
Men can also think the same way: "What have we done?

00:40:11.163 --> 00:40:15.037
What have we done for Sahaja Yoga?"

00:40:15.157 --> 00:40:19.925
Just: I want to meet in the politicians.

00:40:20.045 --> 00:40:25.458
I want to meet this person. I want to meet that person. For what?

00:40:25.759 --> 00:40:27.965
They should come and meet you

00:40:28.085 --> 00:40:31.171
but your faith in yourself is very weak.

00:40:31.291 --> 00:40:34.633
I think that's the main reason for all this fall

00:40:34.753 --> 00:40:37.284
is faith in yourself.

00:40:38.887 --> 00:40:54.370
This faith is such a thing that you know it is.

00:40:54.718 --> 00:40:57.876
You have seen My photographs.

00:40:57.996 --> 00:41:01.935
You are convinced about it. There is nothing to be convinced

00:41:02.055 --> 00:41:05.919
but this faith is not one with your heart.

00:41:06.039 --> 00:41:13.277
It is not just with your being. It's outside.

00:41:13.397 --> 00:41:15.929
All right, Mother will do that. Mother will solve this.

00:41:16.049 --> 00:41:18.242
Mother will do this.

00:41:20.188 --> 00:41:27.598
But, whole thing is now

00:41:27.895 --> 00:41:34.453
to Me looks like, that I have to compulsorily tell you

00:41:34.573 --> 00:41:37.732
to do some sort of a tapasya.

00:41:39.962 --> 00:41:48.085
You ask somebody, "Do you meditate?" "No Mother," very plainly.

00:41:48.791 --> 00:41:54.487
"No Mother, we don't." "So, what are you doing here?" "My,

00:41:54.607 --> 00:42:00.222
My... there is some pain in my knees so I have come to you."

00:42:00.342 --> 00:42:03.139
All right. "But I don't meditate. I am very honest.

00:42:03.259 --> 00:42:05.447
I don't meditate.

00:42:05.948 --> 00:42:08.972
I just have some pain in the knees. Please cure it.

00:42:09.092 --> 00:42:11.317
I don't meditate."

00:42:13.484 --> 00:42:18.700
How many of you really meditate every night?

00:42:20.671 --> 00:42:23.908
Guido said that, "Mother, if You tell like this they will say,

00:42:24.028 --> 00:42:26.327
'All right in the night we do but not in the morning'

00:42:26.447 --> 00:42:30.074
because Mother has said, 'Do it in the night.'"

00:42:30.734 --> 00:42:32.435
There is no earnestness.

00:42:32.555 --> 00:42:45.919
There is no expected any kind of a enthusiasm about it.

00:42:46.433 --> 00:42:49.704
All right, if not today, we will see tomorrow.

00:42:49.824 --> 00:42:53.359
Mother says like that, "It's not necessary.

00:42:53.479 --> 00:42:57.575
It's not important. It's all right."

00:42:57.695 --> 00:43:00.659
So you satisfy yourself.

00:43:00.868 --> 00:43:06.618
But who is the loser? Not Me. I don't need Sahaja Yoga, do I?

00:43:07.397 --> 00:43:11.171
I am doing all the tapasya for your Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:11.291 --> 00:43:16.089
What about you people doing some tapasya about it?

00:43:18.933 --> 00:43:24.674
So now, what I am trying to say that you have got your Realization.

00:43:24.794 --> 00:43:28.410
Now you have reached a great state of understanding,

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:34.259
also of the inner knowledge and also about your connection

00:43:34.379 --> 00:43:38.275
with the spirit and with the God Almighty.

00:43:38.395 --> 00:43:41.009
All this you know now. Many things you know.

00:43:41.129 --> 00:43:48.891
Despite that, it's not yet what it should be from your heart.

00:43:49.011 --> 00:43:54.353
From your earnest desire.

00:43:57.273 --> 00:44:02.315
It doesn't help at all

00:44:02.468 --> 00:44:07.157
any one to deceive oneself, never.

00:44:08.837 --> 00:44:11.809
So I am not saying something for x, y, z.

00:44:11.929 --> 00:44:17.609
I am saying for all of you. Don't try to cheat yourself.

00:44:20.612 --> 00:44:26.483
You are here with such a great purpose.

00:44:27.605 --> 00:44:30.835
This purpose is corrective

00:44:30.955 --> 00:44:36.570
and is the freedom of our minds

00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:40.510
from all these nonsensical destructive forces

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:46.301
and then to spread it all over, talk about it.

00:44:49.062 --> 00:44:56.506
My own conviction is this

00:44:56.626 --> 00:45:01.619
that something has to happen to Sahaja yogis

00:45:01.739 --> 00:45:07.004
to realize how important it is

00:45:07.124 --> 00:45:16.472
to work out something that is within us, which is potential,

00:45:16.592 --> 00:45:22.387
which is just about to bubble up. It's a responsibility,

00:45:22.507 --> 00:45:26.886
whether you are a Jew, a Christian or anything makes no difference.

00:45:27.006 --> 00:45:29.604
It is all outside.

00:45:29.724 --> 00:45:34.847
For what you have to do that you have come into a new realm

00:45:34.967 --> 00:45:39.165
of awareness, into a new realm of a higher life

00:45:39.285 --> 00:45:41.553
where you know all your inner self,

00:45:41.673 --> 00:45:45.891
you know all about what is good and what is not.

00:45:46.011 --> 00:45:50.644
Everything after knowing all this also if you do not grow

00:45:50.764 --> 00:45:53.235
then whom will you blame?

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:04.898
So now we come to a point to understand

00:46:05.018 --> 00:46:07.918
the importance of this Kaliyuga,

00:46:08.038 --> 00:46:11.806
where your Mother is here to help you

00:46:11.926 --> 00:46:16.774
and also to look after you

00:46:16.894 --> 00:46:22.389
very tenderly, sweetly, to tell you everything.

00:46:22.509 --> 00:46:28.920
Actually I can not get angry with any one for more than one minute.

00:46:31.047 --> 00:46:37.810
So to explain to you sweetly what you should have done

00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:41.815
and which you can do, which you have to do.

00:46:41.935 --> 00:46:44.794
All these things I would have really

00:46:44.914 --> 00:46:48.492
would have been telling you all the time.

00:46:48.612 --> 00:46:53.060
I have been bringing you round very sweetly and explaining to you

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:55.950
and telling you that, "This is your own power

00:46:56.070 --> 00:47:01.018
which is within you and which you have to look after and raise it",

00:47:01.138 --> 00:47:05.227
and also you have got so many books

00:47:05.347 --> 00:47:08.385
or ways of understanding that.

00:47:08.505 --> 00:47:12.064
But this inner knowledge which you have

00:47:12.184 --> 00:47:17.090
is something like this that I have a inner knowledge

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:21.941
about, say about, how to build these things

00:47:22.061 --> 00:47:25.949
but I don't do it. It's as simple as that.

00:47:26.069 --> 00:47:30.446
I just don't do it. I have the inner knowledge, all right.

00:47:30.566 --> 00:47:36.926
I am a Ph.D. but I am mad. It's like that.

00:47:38.968 --> 00:47:43.326
So many people mentally very well equipped in Sahaja Yoga, I know.

00:47:43.446 --> 00:47:47.404
But as far as the following of Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

00:47:47.524 --> 00:47:50.390
they are not there.

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:53.287
So I am warning you now.

00:47:53.407 --> 00:47:57.118
It's like Christ has said, "some seeds which are sprouted

00:47:57.238 --> 00:48:00.500
fell on the street, dried out and died."

00:48:01.277 --> 00:48:03.829
Now the judgment is going on all the time.

00:48:03.949 --> 00:48:08.203
When I am talking to you, it's all the judgment is going on.

00:48:08.632 --> 00:48:12.729
So every night you have to meditate.

00:48:12.849 --> 00:48:20.193
And you have to then think about what have you done tonight, today,

00:48:20.325 --> 00:48:23.995
in the whole day what have you achieved.

00:48:25.917 --> 00:48:32.347
But so calculating they are. Supposing I go there at five o'clock

00:48:32.467 --> 00:48:37.904
then I have to be back at 7 otherwise I will miss the point,

00:48:38.024 --> 00:48:41.569
I will not see this person, that person.

00:48:41.689 --> 00:48:45.842
So, everything works like that:

00:48:46.095 --> 00:48:51.199
with the time, with the importance of nonsensical things.

00:48:51.319 --> 00:48:55.224
What has to work is your faith:

00:48:56.797 --> 00:48:58.773
that I am going to do things

00:48:58.893 --> 00:49:03.326
which are truthful, which are sensible, down to earth

00:49:03.446 --> 00:49:11.063
and I'm going to keep myself absolutly extremely free and

00:49:11.183 --> 00:49:17.922
and I'm going to look after not only my inner being

00:49:18.042 --> 00:49:21.727
but the inner being of others.

00:49:21.847 --> 00:49:28.463
Today's special puja is really of more Right side I would say,

00:49:28.583 --> 00:49:31.054
Dussehra is a right side Puja

00:49:31.174 --> 00:49:36.942
because you worship Shri Rama and his bow and everything.

00:49:38.123 --> 00:49:44.587
But think of these incarnation. Fourteen years He went to jail.

00:49:44.707 --> 00:49:48.787
For a particular reason, He went there.

00:49:49.874 --> 00:49:54.674
I mean, if somebody has to go even for one year, it's a headache.

00:49:54.794 --> 00:49:59.449
It's not a jail but it's, we can call, in the forest that He went,

00:49:59.569 --> 00:50:04.227
it was like a jail to Him. He was a king's son.

00:50:04.347 --> 00:50:06.892
He had no place to live, to sleep.

00:50:07.012 --> 00:50:10.500
Everywhere He went, He had to build His own little hut.

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:14.969
So He went there. He had to do it.

00:50:15.089 --> 00:50:17.914
Why, why did He do it?

00:50:18.795 --> 00:50:23.361
Because He had faith in Himself. He is Shri Rama

00:50:23.481 --> 00:50:26.319
and He has to jolly-well do these things.

00:50:26.439 --> 00:50:30.004
He had faith in Himself. And He had faith in God Almighty

00:50:30.124 --> 00:50:35.249
that whatever He is doing, He is doing as a will of God.

00:50:36.042 --> 00:50:39.399
And that is what I have to do, finished.

00:50:39.519 --> 00:50:43.147
I don't care whether I have to face Ravana

00:50:43.267 --> 00:50:47.028
or I have to face this or that, I don't care.

00:50:47.996 --> 00:50:52.997
I am a Sahaja yogi. I don't care.

00:50:53.181 --> 00:50:57.065
My job is to spread Sahaja Yoga, all right.

00:50:57.185 --> 00:51:02.804
My job is to cleanse myself up and know myself.

00:51:02.924 --> 00:51:06.316
This is my work, my job, and this is what I have to do.

00:51:06.436 --> 00:51:10.836
I am not bothered if I get admission in the school or not.

00:51:10.956 --> 00:51:14.593
I am not bothered if somebody has to go by plane,

00:51:14.713 --> 00:51:17.560
so he gets a ticket or not.

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:19.642
You just won't believe

00:51:19.762 --> 00:51:21.985
that you show your faith in yourself,

00:51:22.105 --> 00:51:26.308
you'll get the admission, you'll get the ticket,

00:51:26.428 --> 00:51:31.485
whatever you want it's there. It's all there.

00:51:31.605 --> 00:51:34.688
You don't have to strive for it.

00:51:34.808 --> 00:51:39.469
You don't have to bother for it. It's just there.

00:51:40.548 --> 00:51:44.389
It is. I mean, all My life it has been happening.

00:51:44.509 --> 00:51:50.947
Of course My faith is like solid, like Gibraltar, no question.

00:51:51.067 --> 00:51:54.951
Because I know what I am and I know what I am supposed to do.

00:51:55.071 --> 00:51:58.375
So My, for Me I have no problem.

00:51:58.495 --> 00:52:01.359
All the faith and I know everyone

00:52:01.479 --> 00:52:06.081
and I can say that I can make out a flying bird.

00:52:07.692 --> 00:52:11.197
May not show that. Sometimes I may say that, all right

00:52:11.317 --> 00:52:14.285
this is good, this is that, but I know for definite

00:52:14.405 --> 00:52:17.769
what I am and what I have to do.

00:52:17.889 --> 00:52:21.285
In the same way, you have to know about yourself

00:52:21.405 --> 00:52:24.691
because it is a different category of people you are.

00:52:24.811 --> 00:52:27.920
You are not the ones who need protection from God,

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:32.793
who need protection from the Mother, no.

00:52:33.443 --> 00:52:36.760
You have to give protections to others.

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.433
It is you have to give light to others.

00:52:39.553 --> 00:52:41.830
You have to show them the path.

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:48.232
So you are here for that purpose not for getting a house

00:52:48.352 --> 00:52:53.091
or a, what you call, income tax concession.

00:52:53.211 --> 00:52:58.248
You are not that for. All that nonsense you forget.

00:52:58.368 --> 00:53:01.827
Jolly-well, they'll have to give you concession.

00:53:02.532 --> 00:53:06.899
I, I live like that, absolutely. I am not bothered

00:53:07.019 --> 00:53:09.986
when I am traveling, whether there's a ticket or not

00:53:10.106 --> 00:53:15.050
whether there is, what you call, a seat or not. I am not bothered.

00:53:15.756 --> 00:53:20.521
I am not bothered at all. All right I am traveling.

00:53:20.641 --> 00:53:23.277
I don't even think I am traveling.

00:53:23.397 --> 00:53:26.237
I just think that I am there. That's all.

00:53:27.965 --> 00:53:30.380
So many things I say

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:34.448
which looks so bombastic and looks so ego oriented,

00:53:34.568 --> 00:53:40.011
like I said, "This catholic church is about to finish."

00:53:40.131 --> 00:53:49.072
I said that. If it was someone else they'll say, "Perhaps, maybe."

00:53:54.601 --> 00:54:02.775
Now, so one has to change one's own language, the style.

00:54:02.895 --> 00:54:10.687
And our understanding should be that we are a rough people.

00:54:10.807 --> 00:54:14.880
We are rough as far as ourselves are concerned.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.477
With others we are kind, tender, and sweet.

00:54:19.597 --> 00:54:24.037
But as far as we are concerned, we are not.

00:54:24.259 --> 00:54:27.837
Once it happened, we had a transfer

00:54:27.957 --> 00:54:31.040
and we went into a house, very big house though,

00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:33.981
but there was nothing to sleep upon. There was one bed,

00:54:34.442 --> 00:54:38.162
very small. My husband was sleeping. He just can't do like that.

00:54:38.282 --> 00:54:41.298
I said, "All right, take a challenge." I slept on the ground.

00:54:41.418 --> 00:54:45.738
Next day, I had pain in the body. I told My body,

00:54:45.858 --> 00:54:51.211
"Behave yourself. You must learn how to sleep on stones also."

00:54:51.331 --> 00:54:55.658
And for one month I was sleeping on the ground, still.

00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:58.759
So you have to be harsh with your body.

00:54:58.879 --> 00:55:02.561
You have to be harsh with your mind which gives you ideas

00:55:02.681 --> 00:55:07.006
of materialism or of retarding your progress in spirituality.

00:55:07.942 --> 00:55:11.585
Now, escapes, escapes they find out.

00:55:11.705 --> 00:55:15.322
Ultimately, you come to the last point

00:55:15.442 --> 00:55:19.494
where you do not think about, say, material life

00:55:19.614 --> 00:55:22.202
and you don't think of mental life

00:55:22.322 --> 00:55:27.055
or so called these spiritual lives or anything but you think that

00:55:27.175 --> 00:55:30.408
it's all right, you are free from it and now you have become

00:55:30.528 --> 00:55:34.722
a very, very free person and you can do what you like.

00:55:34.842 --> 00:55:41.588
Supposing you reach a state like that then you just say, "Oh,

00:55:41.708 --> 00:55:48.436
I have reached that state, finished." How are we to believe?

00:55:48.556 --> 00:55:53.677
What's the proof that you have reached that state?

00:55:55.672 --> 00:56:00.921
You must show. Doesn't show but they say, "Ah, we are."

00:56:01.516 --> 00:56:03.651
There is a myth also in Sahaja Yoga:

00:56:03.771 --> 00:56:07.363
that senior, he is a very senior Sahaja yogi.

00:56:07.483 --> 00:56:09.583
I mean, I don't understand.

00:56:09.703 --> 00:56:13.961
What is this? How can there be seniority in Sahaja yoga?

00:56:14.081 --> 00:56:18.233
Cannot be seniority. No question.

00:56:18.799 --> 00:56:23.111
Somebody is say, enters into the sea.

00:56:23.231 --> 00:56:28.655
Some are there for ages standing near the edge

00:56:28.775 --> 00:56:31.477
of the sea holding on to the earth

00:56:31.597 --> 00:56:33.119
because they are afraid to swim

00:56:33.239 --> 00:56:36.237
and some people who have come only yesterday

00:56:36.357 --> 00:56:43.556
might be jumping and going ahead and doing, enjoying the sea.

00:56:43.686 --> 00:56:46.071
So how is it he is the senior?

00:56:46.597 --> 00:56:51.554
We do not have this seniority business in Sahaja yoga.

00:56:52.508 --> 00:56:54.317
There's no seniority.

00:56:54.437 --> 00:56:58.637
And there's also another myth. Maybe this is an excuse. I don't know

00:56:58.757 --> 00:57:01.434
what to say but it is a very common thing to say

00:57:01.554 --> 00:57:04.522
that he is a senior Sahaja yogi or he is a,

00:57:04.642 --> 00:57:09.972
after all he is a senior Sahaja yogi.

00:57:10.092 --> 00:57:11.975
Can't understand.

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:13.602
Like saying a donkey,

00:57:13.722 --> 00:57:17.631
"This donkey is senior. Another donkey is not."

00:57:23.329 --> 00:57:27.219
Then another thing that you suffer from very much

00:57:27.339 --> 00:57:34.800
much, very common is this that "Mother said so."

00:57:36.357 --> 00:57:39.192
Anybody will say, "Oh, Mother said to me,

00:57:39.312 --> 00:57:42.447
She called me and She said it."

00:57:42.979 --> 00:57:46.222
"What did She say?" "Oh you are a very great Sahaja yogi.

00:57:46.342 --> 00:57:49.544
You are this. You are that. You are that."

00:57:51.176 --> 00:57:53.893
Now there are two possibilities.

00:57:54.512 --> 00:58:00.133
One, I might have said it just to befool him.

00:58:02.531 --> 00:58:04.843
I am Mahamaya.

00:58:07.047 --> 00:58:14.011
Or maybe I must have said all this just to see that pamper his ego

00:58:14.131 --> 00:58:17.344
so that he gets to Sahaja Yoga

00:58:17.464 --> 00:58:21.276
and does something substantial than to eat my head.

00:58:23.215 --> 00:58:27.197
So, "Mother said so." Such a great Sahaja yogi,

00:58:27.328 --> 00:58:31.757
I am such and such, very bombastic words,

00:58:31.877 --> 00:58:35.765
very bombastic language he would use.

00:58:37.256 --> 00:58:40.876
And then people, "Ah, what a Sahaja yogi!"

00:58:43.202 --> 00:58:50.477
So the judgment of a Sahaja yogi doesn't come from what he claims

00:58:50.597 --> 00:58:53.529
but what he achieves.

00:58:55.394 --> 00:58:59.996
I have seen some Sahaja yogis are extremely arrogant also.

00:59:00.116 --> 00:59:01.754
Extremely arrogant,

00:59:01.874 --> 00:59:06.260
think no end of themselves. All that is there.

00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:09.267
So many Sahaja yogis I have seen of that kind,

00:59:09.387 --> 00:59:11.837
that they are very, very arrogant

00:59:11.957 --> 00:59:16.246
and that they try to make a big show

00:59:16.366 --> 00:59:20.234
out of what great people they are.

00:59:20.354 --> 00:59:22.629
Humpty Dumpties, as they call them.

00:59:22.749 --> 00:59:28.102
All right, but what a Sahaja yogi who is not like that,

00:59:28.222 --> 00:59:31.070
what is his style is?

00:59:32.187 --> 00:59:34.570
He'll just watch. He will witness the whole thing

00:59:34.690 --> 00:59:38.567
just enjoy and laugh at what is happening.

00:59:38.687 --> 00:59:41.228
What is this man talking like this?

00:59:41.348 --> 00:59:44.407
What's the sense of his talking like this?

00:59:45.256 --> 00:59:50.993
A person who is a Sahaja yogi is a gem.

00:59:51.113 --> 00:59:58.218
Is a gem and gem for which you take him to anywhere, to any place,

00:59:58.338 --> 01:00:01.310
people will say he is a gem.

01:00:11.054 --> 01:00:20.467
My own style is this that when I see a person

01:00:20.587 --> 01:00:26.805
or a Sahaja yogi anywhere, first thing I go inside Myself,

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:33.177
first thing. I don't know if you can do that. I can.

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:38.675
And then I see that person in a very different perspective

01:00:38.854 --> 01:00:42.488
and understand. Because all these powers are with you also.

01:00:42.608 --> 01:00:45.351
It's not My powers only, you all have these powers

01:00:45.471 --> 01:00:47.757
but the only difference between you and Me

01:00:47.877 --> 01:00:50.077
is that I have all faith in Myself

01:00:50.197 --> 01:00:53.037
and you have no faith in yourself.

01:01:01.633 --> 01:01:09.274
So we are at a crossing roads where we have to understand

01:01:09.394 --> 01:01:14.072
who will go higher and who will go lower.

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:17.241
You have to find out who is the one

01:01:17.361 --> 01:01:19.844
who is going to achieve something

01:01:19.964 --> 01:01:23.804
and where am I compared to that person.

01:01:25.569 --> 01:01:28.517
It's said, "You have to suffer. You have to do this.

01:01:28.637 --> 01:01:32.302
You have to do that." Nothing of the kind, by God's grace.

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:34.884
Nothing of that kind.

01:01:37.455 --> 01:01:44.703
So now what is it? What will happen to a Sahaja yogi?

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:50.079
How will you know who is a Sahaja yogi?

01:01:50.199 --> 01:01:57.119
How will you know who is just putting a lip service?

01:01:57.796 --> 01:02:00.940
Only way is that you evolve.

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.621
You become like a mirror

01:02:03.741 --> 01:02:08.861
and you see for yourself what sort of a person he is

01:02:08.981 --> 01:02:14.197
and also you see yourself, what you are.

01:02:14.839 --> 01:02:19.237
Today's lecture is more, sort of,

01:02:19.357 --> 01:02:23.202
is actually absolutely inspired lecture.

01:02:23.322 --> 01:02:26.638
And it is the one that should tell you

01:02:26.758 --> 01:02:31.470
that all that we have done today

01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:40.215
is this to understand our own values about our own life.

01:02:40.335 --> 01:02:43.976
We should understand: "Why are we on this earth?

01:02:44.096 --> 01:02:49.704
What is our purpose and what you have to achieve?"

01:02:50.839 --> 01:02:57.502
See, this I give you My all blessings from My heart.

01:02:57.622 --> 01:03:03.679
And I want you to accept My blessings,

01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:13.837
to be the great lights of God's desire.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:19.378
Try to understand what important time you are born

01:03:19.498 --> 01:03:28.491
and that you have become such good, beautiful people of God.

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:31.947
May God bless you!
