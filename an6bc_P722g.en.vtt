WEBVTT

02:59.100 --> 03:10.757
Today we have gathered here to do the puja of the Devi

03:14.877 --> 03:20.917
The Devi has many forms but

03:21.037 --> 03:26.103
is the embodiment of the shakti.

03:26.223 --> 03:34.157
Adishakti gives shakti to all these embodiments.

03:34.277 --> 03:41.077
And so there are many Goddesses we have at different times.

03:41.197 --> 03:45.427
They came on this earth and did

03:45.547 --> 03:53.637
all that was necessary for the ascent of people who were seekers.

03:53.757 --> 04:03.437
Specially the one we know of Jagadamba, the Durga.

04:03.557 --> 04:11.957
She was trying to protect all the seekers of truth

04:12.077 --> 04:17.757
and to destroy all evil forces.

04:20.397 --> 04:27.117
Because without the ascent of human beings,

04:27.237 --> 04:30.731
they do not know the truth.

04:30.957 --> 04:35.557
And that's why whatever they try to do

04:35.677 --> 04:40.637
is a mental projection. And this mental projection,

04:40.757 --> 04:48.477
if it is not substantiated by truth, by dharma, it declines.

04:49.837 --> 04:52.957
In Sanskrit they call it 'glaani'.

04:53.077 --> 04:56.877
When this glaani takes place

05:00.477 --> 05:06.957
then incarnations are born to solve the problem.

05:10.437 --> 05:18.637
In all incarnations of the Goddess, there have been,

05:18.757 --> 05:22.877
very much incarnated the satanic forces.

05:22.997 --> 05:29.597
They had incarnated and She had to fight them, with them

05:29.877 --> 05:32.077
and destroy them.

05:33.477 --> 05:39.077
But this destruction was not for the destruction sake that

05:39.197 --> 05:42.517
the evil forces are to be destroyed

05:42.637 --> 05:48.757
but evil forces always try to put down the seekers,

05:48.877 --> 05:56.557
put down the saints, try to harm them, sometimes even destroy.

06:02.077 --> 06:10.757
All these destructive forces do not come at the same time, normally

06:10.877 --> 06:14.837
at different times. Is easy to handle

06:14.957 --> 06:20.117
but the aim of the incarnation is to save,

06:20.237 --> 06:22.877
to protect the people who are seekers

06:22.997 --> 06:26.277
because they are the most important people

06:26.397 --> 06:33.117
in the realm of spirituality. All others are nothing but dust,

06:33.237 --> 06:40.997
good for nothing, useless. If they are not seeking the truth

06:41.117 --> 06:47.077
in the eyes of God, they are just useless lives

06:47.197 --> 06:50.917
that have come and will be finished.

06:51.037 --> 06:54.373
They have no value and they have no dignity.

06:54.493 --> 06:58.917
They have no understanding of anything.

06:59.037 --> 07:06.357
So in the judgment of the divine love, we have two types of people:

07:06.477 --> 07:14.037
one who are seekers of truth and the another who are not.

07:14.157 --> 07:17.561
They may be good people. They will be nice people,

07:17.681 --> 07:21.376
they'll be doing us lot of good works: social work, this work,

07:21.496 --> 07:25.561
missionary work, every sort of work they might be doing.

07:25.681 --> 07:28.961
But if they are not seeking the truth

07:29.081 --> 07:31.717
then they do not come to that category

07:31.837 --> 07:36.055
where God has to incarnate.

07:37.581 --> 07:40.857
So try to understand the preciousness,

07:40.977 --> 07:44.597
the importance of seekers.

07:46.317 --> 07:50.437
And that's what you have been seeking.

07:51.237 --> 07:58.637
Very few persons, if you take the percentage, are seeker.

07:58.757 --> 08:06.637
Is very, very wee bit. But it's very important because, say,

08:06.757 --> 08:19.437
a one little part of gold is much more valuable

08:19.557 --> 08:27.117
than mounds of steel. In the same way, a seeker

08:27.237 --> 08:32.357
is much more valuable in the growth of spirituality.

08:32.477 --> 08:36.597
The whole universe was created,

08:36.717 --> 08:43.957
whole atmosphere was built, all the evolution took place

08:44.077 --> 08:49.077
for what? That human beings should know the truth.

08:51.645 --> 08:55.454
But in the modern atmosphere,

08:55.574 --> 08:58.653
it's a very big curse, I think the greatest evil

08:58.773 --> 09:02.037
than all the Shumbha Nishumbhas and all that,

09:02.157 --> 09:06.197
the worst of all is materialism

09:06.917 --> 09:10.637
because materialism makes you gross.

09:10.757 --> 09:13.397
In your seeking also when you are rising,

09:13.517 --> 09:21.797
subtly that materialism catches you. I have been noticing this.

09:23.597 --> 09:27.906
When people come to Sahaja Yoga, right,

09:28.026 --> 09:32.997
they are going deep into themselves.

09:33.117 --> 09:37.957
They are understanding what I am saying. All the inner knowledge

09:38.397 --> 09:42.797
they want to know, what is called as Atmagyan.

09:42.917 --> 09:45.107
Atmagyan means two things:

09:45.227 --> 09:50.815
the knowledge about the spirit and knowledge about yourself.

09:50.935 --> 09:57.037
All this they find out and they know what it is.

09:59.357 --> 10:07.357
This state is the state for which people have been doing

10:07.477 --> 10:11.037
all kinds of things: going to the Himalayas,

10:11.157 --> 10:16.357
meditating in the cold without much clothes on them,

10:16.517 --> 10:20.317
living in the caves with some fruits.

10:21.997 --> 10:30.677
All kinds of tapasyas they would do because the seeking was so deep,

10:31.157 --> 10:38.877
so urgent, and they could not get out of that force of seeking.

10:40.397 --> 10:51.357
But in the modern times, materialism retards that hankering,

10:51.917 --> 10:59.597
that dedication. It's maddening for people when they are seekers.

11:01.637 --> 11:09.166
I have seen before coming to Sahaja Yoga, people spend lot of money,

11:09.286 --> 11:16.837
go to various places, go to Himalayas, go to Nepal, go to Japan,

11:16.957 --> 11:20.544
all over the places they are moving.

11:21.467 --> 11:24.597
But after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

11:24.717 --> 11:28.482
after they have become the spirits,

11:28.754 --> 11:34.638
for the growth of your new awareness

11:35.677 --> 11:38.877
the progress is retarded.

11:38.997 --> 11:44.517
Also one should understand that after so much of running about,

11:44.637 --> 11:48.917
you find something so precious so you settle down with that.

11:49.277 --> 11:53.717
And you feel very satisfied about it. That part is all right.

11:53.837 --> 11:59.477
But what later? Your growth should not stop.

12:01.677 --> 12:04.397
And that stops because,

12:04.517 --> 12:08.877
because of one of the main reasons is materialism.

12:11.717 --> 12:13.677
Because of materialism,

12:13.797 --> 12:18.077
your faith in yourself is also less.

12:18.837 --> 12:24.357
Now as you have seen that the Gods prayed to the Goddess

12:24.477 --> 12:28.437
and She came and killed all the negative forces.

12:31.237 --> 12:37.117
Reason was: the earnest desire of the Gods

12:38.157 --> 12:41.677
compelled Her to take incarnation.

12:42.317 --> 12:45.797
Such sincere desire

12:46.717 --> 12:54.677
that they could not get sometimes food, even water,

12:54.797 --> 13:01.197
and they worked so hard for their ascent

13:01.317 --> 13:05.037
which was disturbed by negative forces.

13:06.317 --> 13:14.350
So their call was so from the heart,

13:14.470 --> 13:19.094
so desperate and genuine and sincere

13:19.214 --> 13:24.717
that the Goddess had to take birth on this earth

13:24.837 --> 13:32.077
to save them, to protect them, to look after them.

13:34.437 --> 13:43.757
But as it is, we see once you have reached a destination,

13:43.997 --> 13:46.877
we feel now better settle down.

13:49.197 --> 13:53.917
Now, what do you - we settle down with?

13:56.797 --> 14:03.757
If after getting Realization you are complete,

14:04.157 --> 14:09.517
you are in totality, you are absolutely one with reality,

14:09.637 --> 14:12.037
there is nothing to be done.

14:14.957 --> 14:17.157
You become a saint.

14:17.357 --> 14:23.797
And a saint does not need any advertisement, does not need anything.

14:23.917 --> 14:26.757
His message spreads. People see him and know

14:26.877 --> 14:29.677
he is a great saint.

14:29.797 --> 14:33.317
So many saints did not even leave their houses.

14:33.437 --> 14:36.237
Very common saying in India,

14:36.357 --> 14:38.717
"Your takiya you should not leave,"

14:38.837 --> 14:42.997
the pillow on which you are resting, you should not leave.

14:43.117 --> 14:48.877
That was a criteria of a guru. Those who have to seek

14:48.997 --> 14:53.477
should come to the gurus and should climb up,

14:53.597 --> 14:56.197
at least six seven miles up,

14:56.317 --> 14:59.067
and then the guru doesn't meet any one.

14:59.187 --> 15:01.603
He may slap you. He may hit you.

15:01.723 --> 15:05.957
He may drop you from that high mountain.

15:06.077 --> 15:11.317
He'll take your test by so many ways.

15:11.437 --> 15:15.637
Ultimately he may select one person to give Realization.

15:16.397 --> 15:20.277
So this hankering, this desperate effort

15:20.397 --> 15:24.077
was all the time there.

15:25.837 --> 15:31.317
Now so we come to Sahaja Yoga in this modern time.

15:33.677 --> 15:43.037
Sometimes I feel that not only Sahaja Yoga is very easy

15:43.157 --> 15:52.357
also it is extremely pampering. You know you have got Realization.

15:52.477 --> 15:56.957
You all know that you are better than others,

15:57.077 --> 15:59.317
that you have got rid of so many problems

15:59.437 --> 16:03.397
and that now you have become master of your own.

16:03.597 --> 16:09.837
Then the responsibility

16:11.397 --> 16:19.037
that you have towards yourself and to your fellow men reduces

16:19.837 --> 16:23.437
because you feel very satisfied with yourself.

16:24.877 --> 16:27.477
The other day some Sahaja yogini rang Me up.

16:27.597 --> 16:30.837
I mean, they ring Me up for everything.

16:32.237 --> 16:37.757
She said that, "I went to the doctor and he put radiation

16:37.877 --> 16:42.317
and they found I was pregnant so what should I do about the baby?"

16:42.437 --> 16:45.997
For such a small thing they will ask.

16:46.117 --> 16:48.677
"What should the name of our son?"

16:48.797 --> 16:51.037
"What is this?" "What is that?"

16:51.157 --> 16:55.477
I mean, I have to do much more work than any priest has to do.

16:56.637 --> 17:02.157
Little, little things they are worried about. All right,

17:02.677 --> 17:07.677
that part is all right that I have to tell you

17:07.797 --> 17:11.517
what is to be done at such a point or what should we do.

17:11.637 --> 17:14.517
If they miss the train, they will telephone to Me,

17:14.637 --> 17:17.277
"Mother, we have missed the train. Now what to do?"

17:17.397 --> 17:21.317
So I have to tell them, "All right, give them a bandhan."

17:21.437 --> 17:23.917
That also I have to tell them.

17:24.037 --> 17:30.877
Or supposing their father is sick. He has a heart trouble

17:30.997 --> 17:34.197
then they will telephone to Me, "Mother, my father is sick.

17:34.317 --> 17:36.957
He has a heart trouble. He is not a Sahaja yogi.

17:37.077 --> 17:41.317
What can You do about it?" So Mother has to put attention

17:41.437 --> 17:44.397
to his father who is not a Sahaja yogui.

17:46.637 --> 17:50.157
Small, small things they write to Me.

17:50.277 --> 17:53.717
Such small things that you can't imagine

17:54.437 --> 18:00.157
how they do not understand what I am here for.

18:02.357 --> 18:07.837
Still, I have never said that "It's a stupid thing to ask Me.

18:07.957 --> 18:11.277
You should not waste My time," never.

18:12.397 --> 18:15.277
But it is to be seen now

18:15.637 --> 18:22.277
that if you do not value yourself as realized souls,

18:22.397 --> 18:25.517
you can not value My time also

18:25.637 --> 18:30.437
or what is Myself.

18:30.557 --> 18:34.797
This incarnation can be wasted completely

18:35.317 --> 18:40.237
because of this materialistic attitude.

18:42.957 --> 18:46.037
In this modern times, I don't know

18:46.157 --> 18:48.757
what's gone wrong with human beings

18:48.877 --> 18:53.957
because the most important thing in your life

18:54.077 --> 18:57.197
is to ascend and to grow.

18:57.437 --> 19:01.237
Take a big vision of the whole thing.

19:01.437 --> 19:05.437
Why this universe was created?

19:05.557 --> 19:10.677
Why you were created as human beings?

19:10.837 --> 19:15.877
What was the need to do all these things? For what is it done?

19:15.997 --> 19:20.077
If you have a very big vision of the whole thing

19:20.197 --> 19:23.837
then try to locate your position: "Where am I?!

19:23.957 --> 19:27.117
And then, "How the Divine has selected me

19:27.237 --> 19:30.717
and now I have become a Sahaja yogi?"

19:32.957 --> 19:35.797
So now, "What is my responsibility?"

19:36.317 --> 19:38.877
that one has to see.

19:39.997 --> 19:44.237
But on the contrary, I have seen people

19:44.717 --> 19:48.397
who are saying have a transfer. So they will telephone and ask,

19:48.517 --> 19:52.637
"Mother, should we take our chair or not?"

19:54.437 --> 19:58.237
That shows they have no value about themselves

19:58.357 --> 20:02.477
and no value about Me, both ways.

20:02.597 --> 20:07.037
Because they are asking such small things, such silly things

20:07.157 --> 20:10.277
that is impossible to understand how

20:10.397 --> 20:15.357
could Sahaja yogis ask such questions.

20:23.397 --> 20:29.797
The perspective we can see: the Goddess.

20:30.037 --> 20:32.757
She comes on this earth

20:32.877 --> 20:36.317
in different forms at different times

20:37.037 --> 20:41.077
to save the seekers of truth

20:41.637 --> 20:46.957
and to work out the ascent of the seekers of truth.

20:47.077 --> 20:49.717
Can you imagine?

20:49.837 --> 20:53.957
A very big difference in the incarnation

20:54.077 --> 20:59.717
of the Goddess before Kaliyuga.

21:00.477 --> 21:05.917
While now, it's a very different thing

21:06.037 --> 21:08.877
that you have come on this earth

21:08.997 --> 21:12.917
to become the Sahaja yogis.

21:13.037 --> 21:17.717
You  have to have a body, a mind,

21:17.837 --> 21:23.397
feeling everything which is just charged with spirituality,

21:23.517 --> 21:25.557
charged with your spirituality.

21:25.677 --> 21:29.717
Should be normally

21:29.837 --> 21:32.797
because how many years in the past

21:32.917 --> 21:35.797
you have been seeking God.

21:35.917 --> 21:41.517
Then that came here. What a coincidence!

21:42.077 --> 21:49.877
When, what is it? When you have such a great advantage

21:49.997 --> 21:55.477
that you have come to Sahaja Yoga because of your seeking

21:55.597 --> 22:00.757
and now you have found the satisfaction out of it.

22:00.877 --> 22:06.557
What is the responsibility that you have?

22:11.357 --> 22:15.557
That the incarnation Itself has come on this earth,

22:15.677 --> 22:22.237
not only to protect you, to nourish you, and to kill the demons, no!

22:22.357 --> 22:25.077
She has come on this earth

22:25.197 --> 22:30.077
to tell you about everything that is subtler

22:30.197 --> 22:35.517
inside and to tell you what should be

22:35.637 --> 22:40.237
your relationship: should be outside as well as inside.

22:40.357 --> 22:42.557
You were never connected with truth.

22:42.677 --> 22:46.397
You were never connected with this all-pervading power.

22:46.517 --> 22:52.077
You were never connected with God Almighty.

22:54.077 --> 22:56.997
So one has to understand that,

22:57.117 --> 23:01.957
"What a great thing has happened that out of me only,

23:02.077 --> 23:04.437
this Kundalini has come out

23:04.557 --> 23:14.157
and She has touched these higher centers." How?

23:14.397 --> 23:17.677
This was not done before, no.

23:17.797 --> 23:22.517
They were just protected. They were just looked after.

23:22.637 --> 23:25.397
Nowhere it is written that "Goddess

23:25.517 --> 23:29.117
has given Realization to people" nowhere.

23:30.797 --> 23:33.317
She is responsible. She can give.

23:33.437 --> 23:36.677
One of Her names is that. Not one but at least ten names are

23:36.797 --> 23:42.997
that She gives you your nirvana, that She gives you your freedom,

23:43.117 --> 23:46.637
that She introduces you to liberty.

23:46.757 --> 23:53.157
All these things are written but what's happening now

23:53.277 --> 23:59.677
is that people have not yet been able to grasp

23:59.797 --> 24:04.917
the value of their life in the modern times.

24:06.557 --> 24:09.757
See the way people ask questions.

24:09.877 --> 24:12.837
See the way people, the inquiry is on,

24:12.957 --> 24:15.277
the way people are worried,

24:15.397 --> 24:16.957
"Now my child is big.

24:17.077 --> 24:20.117
What should I do?" What should you do?

24:20.237 --> 24:22.917
Child is big. Put him to school. Do what you like.

24:23.037 --> 24:27.797
"Mother, will you please tell where to put the child."

24:28.077 --> 24:31.797
Then you put the child."Have you seen the school, Mother?" "No, I haven't."

24:31.917 --> 24:34.077
"Then you go and inspect the school."

24:34.197 --> 24:38.517
Imagine Kali Mata doing that!

24:38.637 --> 24:42.557
She would have given two nice tight slaps, I tell you.

24:43.037 --> 24:46.877
Any body who would have said that, what do you make out of it?

24:48.077 --> 24:53.477
But to that detailed extent a Motherhood has to work out.

24:53.597 --> 24:57.197
You won't do that for your own child, I know.

24:58.037 --> 25:02.757
But when it comes to children, what are they doing?

25:04.517 --> 25:06.717
Still materialistic.

25:09.037 --> 25:14.077
Today specially it's a very great day of Dussehra.

25:14.677 --> 25:19.877
This is the day when, as you know, Ravana was burnt.

25:20.317 --> 25:23.877
Effigies of Ravana were burnt all over the place.

25:23.997 --> 25:30.357
When Shri Rama came this was done, His victory.

25:30.477 --> 25:32.077
But in His victory,

25:32.197 --> 25:34.637
it was not that He made Sahaja yogis

25:34.757 --> 25:37.797
or He gave Realization, no.

25:38.637 --> 25:41.877
His victory was that He killed Ravana.

25:43.717 --> 25:47.877
That was done that time for today's preparation.

25:48.997 --> 25:53.397
For today's happening, it was done long time back

25:55.637 --> 26:02.157
that these days will come

26:02.277 --> 26:10.637
when people will have proper value system of victory of Shri Rama.

26:12.157 --> 26:14.277
But it doesn't happen.

26:17.797 --> 26:22.117
It doesn't happen. Because this incarnation

26:22.237 --> 26:28.717
of Mataji Nirmala Devi is very different, very illusive, Mahamaya.

26:30.797 --> 26:33.237
So you are left to yourself,

26:33.357 --> 26:37.877
do what you like. Whatever you like, you can do it.

26:38.557 --> 26:43.557
So they will ask Me, "Mother, we have a problem."

26:43.677 --> 26:49.157
I said, "What?" "We don't know which kind of chairs we should buy."

26:50.077 --> 26:53.917
For every small thing they will refer to Mother

26:54.037 --> 26:57.437
but for important things, never.

26:57.557 --> 27:01.557
Sort of a funny use of the whole thing has started

27:01.677 --> 27:04.637
which is so great, so important

27:04.757 --> 27:08.957
is used for something absolutely nonsensical.

27:10.237 --> 27:13.717
So see the difference between the incarnations.

27:13.837 --> 27:18.517
One incarnation comes on this earth to save the people,

27:18.637 --> 27:23.477
to bring them out of the mire of Maya.

27:24.837 --> 27:29.477
But another incarnation which has come

27:29.597 --> 27:34.037
is not only just to talk about it

27:34.157 --> 27:36.957
but to give you your Realization

27:37.077 --> 27:40.597
and then to look after your small, small things.

27:42.557 --> 27:44.997
So when this lady telephoned and asked Me,

27:45.117 --> 27:49.717
"What should I do? Please Mother, cure me."

27:50.917 --> 27:53.837
It's very different attitude.

27:53.957 --> 27:56.677
Between the bhaktas of those days

27:56.797 --> 28:00.877
and the bhaktas of today, there's a very big difference.

28:00.997 --> 28:03.917
I said, "You never asked Me

28:04.037 --> 28:06.477
when you did all that, doesn't matter.

28:06.597 --> 28:09.917
Now whatever you have done, it's better I see the child,

28:10.037 --> 28:14.517
look after the child, put the child right but you come along."

28:18.997 --> 28:24.277
But then I realized that this woman is so attached to her child.

28:24.397 --> 28:26.917
And I telephoned to the leader

28:27.037 --> 28:30.037
and he said, "It's terrible attachment.

28:32.517 --> 28:35.717
It's a terrible attachment to the child."

28:36.517 --> 28:40.557
So now from one nonsense to another nonsense.

28:42.317 --> 28:49.517
This incarnation has such variety of jobs to be done.

28:49.637 --> 28:57.197
I mean, even the 64 kalas, the 64 expertise

28:57.317 --> 29:01.477
of Shri Ganesh is not sufficient to solve this.

29:03.837 --> 29:11.277
Why is it so complicated? After giving Self- Realization,

29:11.397 --> 29:15.277
it should be a straight forward march

29:15.397 --> 29:19.757
towards your goal and towards your growth.

29:20.877 --> 29:25.357
But why is it that such a complicated nonsense

29:25.477 --> 29:28.597
is all the time bothering you?

29:31.717 --> 29:35.849
What do you want? We should ask, "Now what do you want?"

29:35.969 --> 29:38.917
"I want a child."

29:39.037 --> 29:42.837
After Sahaja Yoga, you should not want anything.

29:42.957 --> 29:46.797
"Why do you want to have a child? There are so many children.

29:46.917 --> 29:49.677
You can look after them."

29:52.717 --> 29:58.397
'I want' goes away, should go away from your mind that,

29:58.517 --> 30:08.197
"I want this and I want that." This wanting is over now.

30:08.397 --> 30:12.037
What you wanted: your Self-Realization.

30:12.957 --> 30:16.277
After that, what has happened is that now:

30:16.397 --> 30:22.357
what I want is more important and I want

30:22.477 --> 30:27.197
that you should become really detached from materialism.

30:27.717 --> 30:29.530
That doesn't mean

30:29.650 --> 30:33.402
that you should become like "Hare Rama Hare Krishna" no, no, no, no.

30:33.522 --> 30:35.837
They are not detached.

30:35.957 --> 30:41.757
They are very much attached people. But detachment is a state where

30:41.877 --> 30:45.997
nothing can bind you, nothing is important,

30:46.117 --> 30:50.277
most important thing  is your spiritual ascent.

30:50.397 --> 30:56.837
Nothing can attract you more than this.

30:56.957 --> 31:02.837
This is what exactly is wanted today,

31:02.957 --> 31:06.677
that Sahaja yogis should understand.

31:07.637 --> 31:11.837
Compared to what Sahaja yogis, compared to Sahaja yogis,

31:11.957 --> 31:16.117
what people have gone through. When I read it everyday,

31:16.237 --> 31:18.717
I feel terrible.

31:18.837 --> 31:23.197
Here everything is convenience, convenient,

31:23.317 --> 31:26.757
come along, enjoy nice food, nice company,

31:26.877 --> 31:33.237
it's a festival going on. Everything is [inaudible].

31:33.877 --> 31:36.237
And if something is missing, I will be the one

31:36.357 --> 31:38.426
to tell the organizers, "What is this?

31:38.546 --> 31:42.226
You should have done this. You should have done that."

31:49.597 --> 31:58.957
Now, we come to a point where we have to understand:

31:59.317 --> 32:01.797
What do we want?

32:04.637 --> 32:09.117
What's the use of killing Shumbha Nishumbhas?

32:09.237 --> 32:14.037
What's the use of killing this catholic church? What's the use?

32:14.157 --> 32:16.477
Because you are static.

32:17.957 --> 32:21.917
You are glued in one place, no progress.

32:22.037 --> 32:25.477
So what's the use of doing all these things all the time

32:25.597 --> 32:29.197
and destroying all that negativity.

32:31.317 --> 32:35.637
What is the purpose?

32:35.757 --> 32:38.637
It's too arbitrary, everybody says, "Mother,

32:38.757 --> 32:42.637
you have given them permission. You have given them license,

32:42.757 --> 32:45.797
so now they are doing the way they are."

32:45.917 --> 32:48.197
The other day, one girl came to Me.

32:48.317 --> 32:52.477
Her child was very sick. I asked her: "Do you meditate?"

32:52.597 --> 32:54.477
She kept quiet.

32:55.077 --> 32:57.677
I said I can make out that you don't meditate

32:57.797 --> 33:00.117
because I know what it is.

33:01.117 --> 33:04.237
That you don't even meditate?

33:06.317 --> 33:10.837
So today's main thing is this is a Dussehra day

33:10.957 --> 33:13.277
when the people go,

33:13.397 --> 33:15.917
cross the boundaries of their villages

33:16.037 --> 33:20.397
and bring gold for the parents.

33:20.677 --> 33:23.397
That's the story, it is like that.

33:23.517 --> 33:25.837
Now what you have to do is to

33:25.957 --> 33:31.677
cross the limits of materialism, this nonsensical

33:31.797 --> 33:36.237
dwarfy force that is working on you

33:36.517 --> 33:43.757
and you have to transcend and bring, as I said, gold

33:44.477 --> 33:52.637
that is untarnishable thing from the borders of Sahaja yoga.

33:54.837 --> 34:00.797
How many of you really are in the field of work?

34:00.917 --> 34:04.557
How many of you are telling about this to people?

34:06.237 --> 34:09.157
What are you doing about it?

34:15.837 --> 34:21.957
Why I am talking to you and not to Indians this way

34:22.077 --> 34:27.317
because their attitude is different.

34:27.437 --> 34:31.637
Their attitude is not materialistic. It's spiritual.

34:32.117 --> 34:35.197
They want their spiritual ascent

34:35.357 --> 34:41.077
for which they suffer a lot. They go out of the way to do things

34:41.197 --> 34:50.157
just to get to that state where they could be easily surrendered.

34:50.917 --> 34:54.397
This surrender state has to come.

34:54.517 --> 34:58.677
For example, you have a problem.

34:59.917 --> 35:03.557
Say problem, you have no holidays

35:03.677 --> 35:08.157
and you want to come for Pujas, say. I'm just giving an example.

35:08.277 --> 35:13.717
Now, if you want to come to Puja, you just come.

35:14.317 --> 35:18.197
Not only you will get job but you might get promotion.

35:19.597 --> 35:22.637
But you have no faith in your ascent.

35:22.757 --> 35:29.277
You have no faith that you are the chosen one.

35:29.597 --> 35:33.837
This is what is missing because of materialism.

35:36.437 --> 35:42.837
Recently in America, we have a very great Sahaja yogi,

35:42.957 --> 35:46.117
Dave Dunphy. I told him, "Dave,

35:46.237 --> 35:49.397
you better take over as the leader of America

35:49.517 --> 35:53.797
because this gentleman is not all right and you better take over."

35:54.637 --> 35:59.837
Immediately he said, "All right Mother." Now, he lives in Honolulu.

35:59.957 --> 36:06.357
Our programs and everything are done through L.A., Los Angeles,

36:06.477 --> 36:11.117
and it looked quite strange that I should ask him

36:11.237 --> 36:14.037
to come down and work there.

36:16.797 --> 36:18.957
Now, where are we?

36:19.077 --> 36:23.557
We are the people who have been blessed

36:23.797 --> 36:28.797
with all the powers. You have been blessed.

36:29.077 --> 36:30.893
But we don't want to practice.

36:31.013 --> 36:33.520
We don't want to find out what powers we have,

36:33.640 --> 36:35.505
worried about our own children,

36:35.625 --> 36:38.505
worried about what sari we are going to wear,

36:38.625 --> 36:41.756
or worried about who is the leader

36:41.876 --> 36:44.883
and what should we do about the leadership.

36:49.482 --> 36:52.597
All these things are not going to help us.

36:52.717 --> 36:56.973
You are not here for that. Try to understand.

36:57.093 --> 37:00.977
You are here for becoming the spirit

37:01.097 --> 37:08.277
and then to spread the light of the spirit. Nothing matters.

37:09.301 --> 37:12.873
Once you start doing that, you'll be amazed:

37:12.993 --> 37:18.429
the faith works. It's not blind faith. It's not blind faith.

37:19.220 --> 37:24.715
You don't have to tell Me even. It just works.

37:32.848 --> 37:42.557
It's a matter a few days, you might get many results

37:42.931 --> 37:48.660
of what you have been hankering after,  material,

37:48.780 --> 37:54.700
superficials, you might get. But the question remains.

37:57.229 --> 38:04.957
Somebody, say, wants to dedicate his life, so called,

38:05.095 --> 38:09.504
for Sahaja Yoga. Then what do you do?

38:09.624 --> 38:12.638
What do you do if you dedicate?

38:13.305 --> 38:17.383
First thing is your faith.

38:17.503 --> 38:23.062
You must know: how is your faith into anything.

38:23.182 --> 38:28.557
You really believe in it or you do not? If you do believe in it,

38:28.751 --> 38:31.468
what have you done about it?

38:34.501 --> 38:41.686
So at this stage, you have to introspect.

38:42.132 --> 38:44.209
What are you doing?

38:44.329 --> 38:48.931
What are we to do? How far do we have to go?

38:49.051 --> 38:53.237
It's a very, very important time

38:53.554 --> 39:00.251
and you are extremely important souls here sitting down

39:00.371 --> 39:07.755
but, if you don't value your own systems and yourself,

39:07.875 --> 39:11.075
why should God worry about you?

39:13.714 --> 39:17.273
Why should God try to give you ideas?

39:17.393 --> 39:22.042
Why should He try to take any interest even in you

39:22.162 --> 39:24.281
persons of that [kind].

39:29.670 --> 39:35.363
So now, I have to just tell you that on this day of this Puja,

39:35.483 --> 39:39.831
it's such a combination that it is the Dussehra I am here,

39:39.951 --> 39:45.488
and also is the now we can call it, the last day of the Devi Puja.

39:45.608 --> 39:49.880
We have to see within ourselves, introspect:

39:50.000 --> 39:53.493
"What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?"

39:57.765 --> 40:00.110
Except for looking after my children,

40:00.230 --> 40:04.307
cooking for the husband, that's all?

40:06.298 --> 40:10.703
Men can also think the same way: "What have we done?

40:11.163 --> 40:15.037
What have we done for Sahaja Yoga?"

40:15.157 --> 40:19.925
Just: I want to meet in the politicians.

40:20.045 --> 40:25.458
I want to meet this person. I want to meet that person. For what?

40:25.759 --> 40:27.965
They should come and meet you

40:28.085 --> 40:31.171
but your faith in yourself is very weak.

40:31.291 --> 40:34.633
I think that's the main reason for all this fall

40:34.753 --> 40:37.284
is faith in yourself.

40:38.887 --> 40:54.370
This faith is such a thing that you know it is.

40:54.718 --> 40:57.876
You have seen My photographs.

40:57.996 --> 41:01.935
You are convinced about it. There is nothing to be convinced

41:02.055 --> 41:05.919
but this faith is not one with your heart.

41:06.039 --> 41:13.277
It is not just with your being. It's outside.

41:13.397 --> 41:15.929
All right, Mother will do that. Mother will solve this.

41:16.049 --> 41:18.242
Mother will do this.

41:20.188 --> 41:27.598
But, whole thing is now

41:27.895 --> 41:34.453
to Me looks like, that I have to compulsorily tell you

41:34.573 --> 41:37.732
to do some sort of a tapasya.

41:39.962 --> 41:48.085
You ask somebody, "Do you meditate?" "No Mother," very plainly.

41:48.791 --> 41:54.487
"No Mother, we don't." "So, what are you doing here?" "My,

41:54.607 --> 42:00.222
My... there is some pain in my knees so I have come to you."

42:00.342 --> 42:03.139
All right. "But I don't meditate. I am very honest.

42:03.259 --> 42:05.447
I don't meditate.

42:05.948 --> 42:08.972
I just have some pain in the knees. Please cure it.

42:09.092 --> 42:11.317
I don't meditate."

42:13.484 --> 42:18.700
How many of you really meditate every night?

42:20.671 --> 42:23.908
Guido said that, "Mother, if You tell like this they will say,

42:24.028 --> 42:26.327
'All right in the night we do but not in the morning'

42:26.447 --> 42:30.074
because Mother has said, 'Do it in the night.'"

42:30.734 --> 42:32.435
There is no earnestness.

42:32.555 --> 42:45.919
There is no expected any kind of a enthusiasm about it.

42:46.433 --> 42:49.704
All right, if not today, we will see tomorrow.

42:49.824 --> 42:53.359
Mother says like that, "It's not necessary.

42:53.479 --> 42:57.575
It's not important. It's all right."

42:57.695 --> 43:00.659
So you satisfy yourself.

43:00.868 --> 43:06.618
But who is the loser? Not Me. I don't need Sahaja Yoga, do I?

43:07.397 --> 43:11.171
I am doing all the tapasya for your Sahaja Yoga.

43:11.291 --> 43:16.089
What about you people doing some tapasya about it?

43:18.933 --> 43:24.674
So now, what I am trying to say that you have got your Realization.

43:24.794 --> 43:28.410
Now you have reached a great state of understanding,

43:28.530 --> 43:34.259
also of the inner knowledge and also about your connection

43:34.379 --> 43:38.275
with the spirit and with the God Almighty.

43:38.395 --> 43:41.009
All this you know now. Many things you know.

43:41.129 --> 43:48.891
Despite that, it's not yet what it should be from your heart.

43:49.011 --> 43:54.353
From your earnest desire.

43:57.273 --> 44:02.315
It doesn't help at all

44:02.468 --> 44:07.157
any one to deceive oneself, never.

44:08.837 --> 44:11.809
So I am not saying something for x, y, z.

44:11.929 --> 44:17.609
I am saying for all of you. Don't try to cheat yourself.

44:20.612 --> 44:26.483
You are here with such a great purpose.

44:27.605 --> 44:30.835
This purpose is corrective

44:30.955 --> 44:36.570
and is the freedom of our minds

44:36.690 --> 44:40.510
from all these nonsensical destructive forces

44:40.630 --> 44:46.301
and then to spread it all over, talk about it.

44:49.062 --> 44:56.506
My own conviction is this

44:56.626 --> 45:01.619
that something has to happen to Sahaja yogis

45:01.739 --> 45:07.004
to realize how important it is

45:07.124 --> 45:16.472
to work out something that is within us, which is potential,

45:16.592 --> 45:22.387
which is just about to bubble up. It's a responsibility,

45:22.507 --> 45:26.886
whether you are a Jew, a Christian or anything makes no difference.

45:27.006 --> 45:29.604
It is all outside.

45:29.724 --> 45:34.847
For what you have to do that you have come into a new realm

45:34.967 --> 45:39.165
of awareness, into a new realm of a higher life

45:39.285 --> 45:41.553
where you know all your inner self,

45:41.673 --> 45:45.891
you know all about what is good and what is not.

45:46.011 --> 45:50.644
Everything after knowing all this also if you do not grow

45:50.764 --> 45:53.235
then whom will you blame?

45:59.390 --> 46:04.898
So now we come to a point to understand

46:05.018 --> 46:07.918
the importance of this Kaliyuga,

46:08.038 --> 46:11.806
where your Mother is here to help you

46:11.926 --> 46:16.774
and also to look after you

46:16.894 --> 46:22.389
very tenderly, sweetly, to tell you everything.

46:22.509 --> 46:28.920
Actually I can not get angry with any one for more than one minute.

46:31.047 --> 46:37.810
So to explain to you sweetly what you should have done

46:37.930 --> 46:41.815
and which you can do, which you have to do.

46:41.935 --> 46:44.794
All these things I would have really

46:44.914 --> 46:48.492
would have been telling you all the time.

46:48.612 --> 46:53.060
I have been bringing you round very sweetly and explaining to you

46:53.180 --> 46:55.950
and telling you that, "This is your own power

46:56.070 --> 47:01.018
which is within you and which you have to look after and raise it",

47:01.138 --> 47:05.227
and also you have got so many books

47:05.347 --> 47:08.385
or ways of understanding that.

47:08.505 --> 47:12.064
But this inner knowledge which you have

47:12.184 --> 47:17.090
is something like this that I have a inner knowledge

47:17.210 --> 47:21.941
about, say about, how to build these things

47:22.061 --> 47:25.949
but I don't do it. It's as simple as that.

47:26.069 --> 47:30.446
I just don't do it. I have the inner knowledge, all right.

47:30.566 --> 47:36.926
I am a Ph.D. but I am mad. It's like that.

47:38.968 --> 47:43.326
So many people mentally very well equipped in Sahaja Yoga, I know.

47:43.446 --> 47:47.404
But as far as the following of Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

47:47.524 --> 47:50.390
they are not there.

47:50.510 --> 47:53.287
So I am warning you now.

47:53.407 --> 47:57.118
It's like Christ has said, "some seeds which are sprouted

47:57.238 --> 48:00.500
fell on the street, dried out and died."

48:01.277 --> 48:03.829
Now the judgment is going on all the time.

48:03.949 --> 48:08.203
When I am talking to you, it's all the judgment is going on.

48:08.632 --> 48:12.729
So every night you have to meditate.

48:12.849 --> 48:20.193
And you have to then think about what have you done tonight, today,

48:20.325 --> 48:23.995
in the whole day what have you achieved.

48:25.917 --> 48:32.347
But so calculating they are. Supposing I go there at five o'clock

48:32.467 --> 48:37.904
then I have to be back at 7 otherwise I will miss the point,

48:38.024 --> 48:41.569
I will not see this person, that person.

48:41.689 --> 48:45.842
So, everything works like that:

48:46.095 --> 48:51.199
with the time, with the importance of nonsensical things.

48:51.319 --> 48:55.224
What has to work is your faith:

48:56.797 --> 48:58.773
that I am going to do things

48:58.893 --> 49:03.326
which are truthful, which are sensible, down to earth

49:03.446 --> 49:11.063
and I'm going to keep myself absolutly extremely free and

49:11.183 --> 49:17.922
and I'm going to look after not only my inner being

49:18.042 --> 49:21.727
but the inner being of others.

49:21.847 --> 49:28.463
Today's special puja is really of more Right side I would say,

49:28.583 --> 49:31.054
Dussehra is a right side Puja

49:31.174 --> 49:36.942
because you worship Shri Rama and his bow and everything.

49:38.123 --> 49:44.587
But think of these incarnation. Fourteen years He went to jail.

49:44.707 --> 49:48.787
For a particular reason, He went there.

49:49.874 --> 49:54.674
I mean, if somebody has to go even for one year, it's a headache.

49:54.794 --> 49:59.449
It's not a jail but it's, we can call, in the forest that He went,

49:59.569 --> 50:04.227
it was like a jail to Him. He was a king's son.

50:04.347 --> 50:06.892
He had no place to live, to sleep.

50:07.012 --> 50:10.500
Everywhere He went, He had to build His own little hut.

50:10.620 --> 50:14.969
So He went there. He had to do it.

50:15.089 --> 50:17.914
Why, why did He do it?

50:18.795 --> 50:23.361
Because He had faith in Himself. He is Shri Rama

50:23.481 --> 50:26.319
and He has to jolly-well do these things.

50:26.439 --> 50:30.004
He had faith in Himself. And He had faith in God Almighty

50:30.124 --> 50:35.249
that whatever He is doing, He is doing as a will of God.

50:36.042 --> 50:39.399
And that is what I have to do, finished.

50:39.519 --> 50:43.147
I don't care whether I have to face Ravana

50:43.267 --> 50:47.028
or I have to face this or that, I don't care.

50:47.996 --> 50:52.997
I am a Sahaja yogi. I don't care.

50:53.181 --> 50:57.065
My job is to spread Sahaja Yoga, all right.

50:57.185 --> 51:02.804
My job is to cleanse myself up and know myself.

51:02.924 --> 51:06.316
This is my work, my job, and this is what I have to do.

51:06.436 --> 51:10.836
I am not bothered if I get admission in the school or not.

51:10.956 --> 51:14.593
I am not bothered if somebody has to go by plane,

51:14.713 --> 51:17.560
so he gets a ticket or not.

51:17.680 --> 51:19.642
You just won't believe

51:19.762 --> 51:21.985
that you show your faith in yourself,

51:22.105 --> 51:26.308
you'll get the admission, you'll get the ticket,

51:26.428 --> 51:31.485
whatever you want it's there. It's all there.

51:31.605 --> 51:34.688
You don't have to strive for it.

51:34.808 --> 51:39.469
You don't have to bother for it. It's just there.

51:40.548 --> 51:44.389
It is. I mean, all My life it has been happening.

51:44.509 --> 51:50.947
Of course My faith is like solid, like Gibraltar, no question.

51:51.067 --> 51:54.951
Because I know what I am and I know what I am supposed to do.

51:55.071 --> 51:58.375
So My, for Me I have no problem.

51:58.495 --> 52:01.359
All the faith and I know everyone

52:01.479 --> 52:06.081
and I can say that I can make out a flying bird.

52:07.692 --> 52:11.197
May not show that. Sometimes I may say that, all right

52:11.317 --> 52:14.285
this is good, this is that, but I know for definite

52:14.405 --> 52:17.769
what I am and what I have to do.

52:17.889 --> 52:21.285
In the same way, you have to know about yourself

52:21.405 --> 52:24.691
because it is a different category of people you are.

52:24.811 --> 52:27.920
You are not the ones who need protection from God,

52:28.040 --> 52:32.793
who need protection from the Mother, no.

52:33.443 --> 52:36.760
You have to give protections to others.

52:36.880 --> 52:39.433
It is you have to give light to others.

52:39.553 --> 52:41.830
You have to show them the path.

52:41.950 --> 52:48.232
So you are here for that purpose not for getting a house

52:48.352 --> 52:53.091
or a, what you call, income tax concession.

52:53.211 --> 52:58.248
You are not that for. All that nonsense you forget.

52:58.368 --> 53:01.827
Jolly-well, they'll have to give you concession.

53:02.532 --> 53:06.899
I, I live like that, absolutely. I am not bothered

53:07.019 --> 53:09.986
when I am traveling, whether there's a ticket or not

53:10.106 --> 53:15.050
whether there is, what you call, a seat or not. I am not bothered.

53:15.756 --> 53:20.521
I am not bothered at all. All right I am traveling.

53:20.641 --> 53:23.277
I don't even think I am traveling.

53:23.397 --> 53:26.237
I just think that I am there. That's all.

53:27.965 --> 53:30.380
So many things I say

53:30.500 --> 53:34.448
which looks so bombastic and looks so ego oriented,

53:34.568 --> 53:40.011
like I said, "This catholic church is about to finish."

53:40.131 --> 53:49.072
I said that. If it was someone else they'll say, "Perhaps, maybe."

53:54.601 --> 54:02.775
Now, so one has to change one's own language, the style.

54:02.895 --> 54:10.687
And our understanding should be that we are a rough people.

54:10.807 --> 54:14.880
We are rough as far as ourselves are concerned.

54:15.000 --> 54:19.477
With others we are kind, tender, and sweet.

54:19.597 --> 54:24.037
But as far as we are concerned, we are not.

54:24.259 --> 54:27.837
Once it happened, we had a transfer

54:27.957 --> 54:31.040
and we went into a house, very big house though,

54:31.160 --> 54:33.981
but there was nothing to sleep upon. There was one bed,

54:34.442 --> 54:38.162
very small. My husband was sleeping. He just can't do like that.

54:38.282 --> 54:41.298
I said, "All right, take a challenge." I slept on the ground.

54:41.418 --> 54:45.738
Next day, I had pain in the body. I told My body,

54:45.858 --> 54:51.211
"Behave yourself. You must learn how to sleep on stones also."

54:51.331 --> 54:55.658
And for one month I was sleeping on the ground, still.

54:56.420 --> 54:58.759
So you have to be harsh with your body.

54:58.879 --> 55:02.561
You have to be harsh with your mind which gives you ideas

55:02.681 --> 55:07.006
of materialism or of retarding your progress in spirituality.

55:07.942 --> 55:11.585
Now, escapes, escapes they find out.

55:11.705 --> 55:15.322
Ultimately, you come to the last point

55:15.442 --> 55:19.494
where you do not think about, say, material life

55:19.614 --> 55:22.202
and you don't think of mental life

55:22.322 --> 55:27.055
or so called these spiritual lives or anything but you think that

55:27.175 --> 55:30.408
it's all right, you are free from it and now you have become

55:30.528 --> 55:34.722
a very, very free person and you can do what you like.

55:34.842 --> 55:41.588
Supposing you reach a state like that then you just say, "Oh,

55:41.708 --> 55:48.436
I have reached that state, finished." How are we to believe?

55:48.556 --> 55:53.677
What's the proof that you have reached that state?

55:55.672 --> 56:00.921
You must show. Doesn't show but they say, "Ah, we are."

56:01.516 --> 56:03.651
There is a myth also in Sahaja Yoga:

56:03.771 --> 56:07.363
that senior, he is a very senior Sahaja yogi.

56:07.483 --> 56:09.583
I mean, I don't understand.

56:09.703 --> 56:13.961
What is this? How can there be seniority in Sahaja yoga?

56:14.081 --> 56:18.233
Cannot be seniority. No question.

56:18.799 --> 56:23.111
Somebody is say, enters into the sea.

56:23.231 --> 56:28.655
Some are there for ages standing near the edge

56:28.775 --> 56:31.477
of the sea holding on to the earth

56:31.597 --> 56:33.119
because they are afraid to swim

56:33.239 --> 56:36.237
and some people who have come only yesterday

56:36.357 --> 56:43.556
might be jumping and going ahead and doing, enjoying the sea.

56:43.686 --> 56:46.071
So how is it he is the senior?

56:46.597 --> 56:51.554
We do not have this seniority business in Sahaja yoga.

56:52.508 --> 56:54.317
There's no seniority.

56:54.437 --> 56:58.637
And there's also another myth. Maybe this is an excuse. I don't know

56:58.757 --> 57:01.434
what to say but it is a very common thing to say

57:01.554 --> 57:04.522
that he is a senior Sahaja yogi or he is a,

57:04.642 --> 57:09.972
after all he is a senior Sahaja yogi.

57:10.092 --> 57:11.975
Can't understand.

57:12.095 --> 57:13.602
Like saying a donkey,

57:13.722 --> 57:17.631
"This donkey is senior. Another donkey is not."

57:23.329 --> 57:27.219
Then another thing that you suffer from very much

57:27.339 --> 57:34.800
much, very common is this that "Mother said so."

57:36.357 --> 57:39.192
Anybody will say, "Oh, Mother said to me,

57:39.312 --> 57:42.447
She called me and She said it."

57:42.979 --> 57:46.222
"What did She say?" "Oh you are a very great Sahaja yogi.

57:46.342 --> 57:49.544
You are this. You are that. You are that."

57:51.176 --> 57:53.893
Now there are two possibilities.

57:54.512 --> 58:00.133
One, I might have said it just to befool him.

58:02.531 --> 58:04.843
I am Mahamaya.

58:07.047 --> 58:14.011
Or maybe I must have said all this just to see that pamper his ego

58:14.131 --> 58:17.344
so that he gets to Sahaja Yoga

58:17.464 --> 58:21.276
and does something substantial than to eat my head.

58:23.215 --> 58:27.197
So, "Mother said so." Such a great Sahaja yogi,

58:27.328 --> 58:31.757
I am such and such, very bombastic words,

58:31.877 --> 58:35.765
very bombastic language he would use.

58:37.256 --> 58:40.876
And then people, "Ah, what a Sahaja yogi!"

58:43.202 --> 58:50.477
So the judgment of a Sahaja yogi doesn't come from what he claims

58:50.597 --> 58:53.529
but what he achieves.

58:55.394 --> 58:59.996
I have seen some Sahaja yogis are extremely arrogant also.

59:00.116 --> 59:01.754
Extremely arrogant,

59:01.874 --> 59:06.260
think no end of themselves. All that is there.

59:06.380 --> 59:09.267
So many Sahaja yogis I have seen of that kind,

59:09.387 --> 59:11.837
that they are very, very arrogant

59:11.957 --> 59:16.246
and that they try to make a big show

59:16.366 --> 59:20.234
out of what great people they are.

59:20.354 --> 59:22.629
Humpty Dumpties, as they call them.

59:22.749 --> 59:28.102
All right, but what a Sahaja yogi who is not like that,

59:28.222 --> 59:31.070
what is his style is?

59:32.187 --> 59:34.570
He'll just watch. He will witness the whole thing

59:34.690 --> 59:38.567
just enjoy and laugh at what is happening.

59:38.687 --> 59:41.228
What is this man talking like this?

59:41.348 --> 59:44.407
What's the sense of his talking like this?

59:45.256 --> 59:50.993
A person who is a Sahaja yogi is a gem.

59:51.113 --> 59:58.218
Is a gem and gem for which you take him to anywhere, to any place,

59:58.338 --> 01:00:01.310
people will say he is a gem.

01:00:11.054 --> 01:00:20.467
My own style is this that when I see a person

01:00:20.587 --> 01:00:26.805
or a Sahaja yogi anywhere, first thing I go inside Myself,

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:33.177
first thing. I don't know if you can do that. I can.

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:38.675
And then I see that person in a very different perspective

01:00:38.854 --> 01:00:42.488
and understand. Because all these powers are with you also.

01:00:42.608 --> 01:00:45.351
It's not My powers only, you all have these powers

01:00:45.471 --> 01:00:47.757
but the only difference between you and Me

01:00:47.877 --> 01:00:50.077
is that I have all faith in Myself

01:00:50.197 --> 01:00:53.037
and you have no faith in yourself.

01:01:01.633 --> 01:01:09.274
So we are at a crossing roads where we have to understand

01:01:09.394 --> 01:01:14.072
who will go higher and who will go lower.

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:17.241
You have to find out who is the one

01:01:17.361 --> 01:01:19.844
who is going to achieve something

01:01:19.964 --> 01:01:23.804
and where am I compared to that person.

01:01:25.569 --> 01:01:28.517
It's said, "You have to suffer. You have to do this.

01:01:28.637 --> 01:01:32.302
You have to do that." Nothing of the kind, by God's grace.

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:34.884
Nothing of that kind.

01:01:37.455 --> 01:01:44.703
So now what is it? What will happen to a Sahaja yogi?

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:50.079
How will you know who is a Sahaja yogi?

01:01:50.199 --> 01:01:57.119
How will you know who is just putting a lip service?

01:01:57.796 --> 01:02:00.940
Only way is that you evolve.

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:03.621
You become like a mirror

01:02:03.741 --> 01:02:08.861
and you see for yourself what sort of a person he is

01:02:08.981 --> 01:02:14.197
and also you see yourself, what you are.

01:02:14.839 --> 01:02:19.237
Today's lecture is more, sort of,

01:02:19.357 --> 01:02:23.202
is actually absolutely inspired lecture.

01:02:23.322 --> 01:02:26.638
And it is the one that should tell you

01:02:26.758 --> 01:02:31.470
that all that we have done today

01:02:31.590 --> 01:02:40.215
is this to understand our own values about our own life.

01:02:40.335 --> 01:02:43.976
We should understand: "Why are we on this earth?

01:02:44.096 --> 01:02:49.704
What is our purpose and what you have to achieve?"

01:02:50.839 --> 01:02:57.502
See, this I give you My all blessings from My heart.

01:02:57.622 --> 01:03:03.679
And I want you to accept My blessings,

01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:13.837
to be the great lights of God's desire.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:19.378
Try to understand what important time you are born

01:03:19.498 --> 01:03:28.491
and that you have become such good, beautiful people of God.

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:31.947
May God bless you!
