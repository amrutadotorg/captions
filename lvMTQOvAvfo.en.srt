00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:29,310
Sahaja Culture and Ego
New Jersey Ashram, USA

2
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:40,260
October 26, 1985

3
00:00:40,260 --> 00:01:07,240
Today I was thinking of talking, telling you
about the Sahaja Culture.

4
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:14,770
Now we are formed in dharma, Vishwa Dharma.

5
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:17,840
But it must have a culture.

6
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:25,439
So far in all the religions there is no combination
of religion and culture.

7
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,969
No religion has.

8
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:31,359
That's why everywhere you find different cultures.

9
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:37,109
Say in India, people who follow Hindu religion
have different cultures in different places.

10
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:42,740
They are living in Lucknow, or say in U.P.,
they have a Muslim culture.

11
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,020
More Islamic style.

12
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,310
They'll eat in one plate, do all kinds of
things which normally a South Indian won't

13
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,990
do, and the South Indians have a different
culture from Maharashtrians.

14
00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:02,320
So even in a religion like Hindu religion
where culture is important, very important,

15
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,740
we find varieties.

16
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,729
So the cultures get influenced by the neighboring
cultures or surrounding cultures, and that's

17
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,890
how people get lost.

18
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,940
When you establish a religion like this, Vishwa
Dharma, it's not like any other religion.

19
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:27,640
It's the real religion within us, and this
reality comes to us because now we are one

20
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,120
with the Spirit.

21
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,420
So when we talk of Sahaja Culture, it is the
culture of the Spirit.

22
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,420
Now what is a culture?

23
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,970
First of all let us see what is a culture
is.

24
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,700
So the culture is the pattern of behavior
we have with others.

25
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,760
Is a common pattern of behavior we are supposed
to have with others.

26
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,100
Like in English language, for example, we'll
say "Thank you".

27
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,460
Even if somebody murders, you may say, "Thank
you".

28
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:05,480
Or the person who murders you can say, "Sorry".

29
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,360
On the phone one may say, just if they say
something you can't hear, "Sorry?"

30
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,360
Every time, "Sorry".

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,631
As if "sorry" is a word so easily to be used.

32
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:16,330
I mean if you are sorry, why are you sorry
for that?

33
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,330
"Sorry?"

34
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,180
On the phone they used to first say, "I beg
your pardon?", was sensible; but now I find

35
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,400
everybody, A to Z, says, "Sorry?"

36
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,140
I mean, it has no meaning, because what are
you sorry about?

37
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,620
Says "Sorry?"

38
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,231
For everything they are sorry.

39
00:03:31,231 --> 00:03:33,330
Or we can say in English language, when we
speak, "I'm afraid".

40
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,790
You see, it's very common, "I'm afraid".

41
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,930
What are you afraid of?

42
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,530
The whole world is afraid of you.

43
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:48,610
So this is the culture, what we talk of, any
culture as such, becomes artificial, is not

44
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,790
spontaneous, doesn't come from reality.

45
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:57,980
It has no meaning; sometimes it is pointless,
absolutely pointless to stick to certain cultures.

46
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,390
So the culture of the Spirit doesn't change.

47
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:07,510
It's universal, and is higher than any other
culture.

48
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,010
Apart from that it integrates all the essences
of all the cultures.

49
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:18,810
So 
it emanates from the spirit.

50
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,160
Now, spirit has two sides.

51
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,842
One side which you see, the another you don't
see, like the moon.

52
00:04:26,842 --> 00:04:32,790
The side you see is outside with other people,
other Sahaja Yogis, other people, other societies,

53
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:40,570
which are not yourself, absolutely.

54
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:48,120
The other side you don't see is the relationship
with God Almighty, relationship with your

55
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,290
Mother.

56
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:58,870
If the other side is not all right, the behavioral
side outside could become artificial, could

57
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,410
become crooked and not Sahaj.

58
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,680
So it's the other way round than any other
culture.

59
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,430
To know any other culture what do we go?

60
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,970
We see how they talk, what is their language,
how they speak, how they behave: all the outside

61
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,350
things we get.

62
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:21,590
We must know "thank you" if we want to know
English language, must know "thank you", "please",

63
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,210
all that.

64
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:29,380
But if you want to know the Sahaja culture,
you have to know your Mother, and you have

65
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,730
to know God Almighty.

66
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:38,190
And the relationship between your Mother and
the God Almighty has to be absolutely perfect.

67
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:41,700
Then there's no problem.

68
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:49,740
But that, the relationship, if it is not all
right, you cannot have artificial Sahaj culture.

69
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,710
That is one thing for sure.

70
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:56,490
Artificial Sahaj culture is not all right.

71
00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:03,311
I would say that India has, in its basics,
the culture of the spirit, India has; because

72
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:16,380
for traditions and traditions in India, and
for ages, people have been seeking the truth.

73
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:23,440
Spiritually they are endowed, because of the
saints.

74
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:31,610
They are blessed specially because they have
been seekers, not of material things, but

75
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,500
of the spirit.

76
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:41,430
Specially in Maharashtra, we should say, because
the Kundalini is there always like a magnet.

77
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:47,130
People are attracted because Shri Ganesha
being the magnet, attracted towards God and

78
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,130
spirit.

79
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,840
So they form a pattern, but there is lot of
artificiality in that also has grown.

80
00:06:52,840 --> 00:07:01,960
We must admit that there is lot, lot of artificiality,
falsehood, nonsense that has grown into it,

81
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,610
because the religion fell into the hands of,
spiritual religion fell into the hands of

82
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:12,400
gross, horrible so-called Brahmins who were
not realized souls.

83
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,620
So the whole culture has become so nonsensical
sometimes that you don't know where to look.

84
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:29,580
But to have the culture, first of all, culture
is developed through meditation, by facing

85
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,729
yourself.

86
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:45,110
First of all you should face yourself, how
you feel about your Mother and about God Almighty.

87
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:52,020
First of all, how much liberty you take of
your Mother?

88
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,350
How much granted, take for granted your Mother?

89
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:02,710
She's a Mahamaya.

90
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,720
Even the first "M" is difficult to understand.

91
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:14,990
So when you start taking liberties, all the
time putting your pressure on Her, all the

92
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:24,759
time trying to attract Her attention, Her
time, or writing letters eleven pages, all

93
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:26,660
that, is one side.

94
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:32,000
Another side is complete indifference to your
Mother.

95
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,539
So it is to be known through your heart.

96
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:37,290
You don't have to talk to Me.

97
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:41,930
I know whose heart is pulsating.

98
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:47,680
Perhaps I'm the only person who knows really
what you are.

99
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,250
You may not be knowing yourself also.

100
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:59,050
I may not say, but I know you in all details,
out of which I may say little bit, because

101
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,860
I am too gentle to say things.

102
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,260
Because again of Sahaj culture.

103
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,760
Because of Sahaj culture, I cannot say everything
to you on your face.

104
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,390
I'm correcting it, trying to correct it, correct
it; if not possible, then I say to you.

105
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,040
Then in that you have to also see how much
worshipful you are.

106
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,370
Some people, though they spend more time with
Me, remain with Me, want to be with Me, it

107
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,600
is only when they feel surrendered, also.

108
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,881
So it should not be confused: if somebody
is spending more time with Me, you should

109
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:38,710
not condemn yourself for that.

110
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,000
It's all right.

111
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,580
But how far you are surrendered is the point.

112
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:48,390
Now, if you are surrendered, how do you see
the surrendering in a person?

113
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:54,770
You see it has one side and the another is
the expression.

114
00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:04,340
Say a person who is surrendered doesn't talk
much to Me, doesn't talk, he listens, doesn't

115
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,340
talk.

116
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,710
Common sense, he listens.

117
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:16,890
Even people who are very good, I've seen when
I'm talking, they'll put in their own words

118
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,300
in between.

119
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,779
People who are very good, I should say.

120
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,490
So the surrendering is not full.

121
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,750
Then the time, they become very conscious
of the time.

122
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,600
Who has made the time?

123
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,110
But the person won't come directly and tell
Me, but tell somebody else, "Go and tell Mother,

124
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:37,490
She has to go at this time."

125
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:46,220
I know everything, who tells whom, who goes
to whom, who is telling someone, who is time-bound.

126
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,760
And then I flout it.

127
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,220
I know what time to reach, what is the auspicious
time, how it will work out.

128
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,950
Surrendering has to be to that point, that
you shouldn't worry.

129
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:04,130
I would say Dumahl is one of them who is a
very great surrendered fellow.

130
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,330
When I went there I was very tired, and he
said.

131
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,610
"Mother, if You want to rest You can rest."

132
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,779
I said, "Yes, I want to rest."

133
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,140
So he just left Me alone.

134
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:17,950
I was really very tired because I had a very
long journey, and then this and that, and

135
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,209
then I went down all the way there.

136
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:24,530
I thought, "I'll lie down, and sleep off.

137
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:31,800
" Of course, as I know that everything has
to be done at right time, I just went down.

138
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:42,200
And we had a program of My reception at one
place in a village, and they were all waiting

139
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,170
for Me there.

140
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,170
And I was sleeping; he wouldn't wake Me up.

141
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,170
He wouldn't wake Me up.

142
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,650
He said, "Everything will be all right.

143
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:53,800
Tell them when Mother will come."

144
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,420
So there was sun on, they were all sitting
under the tree, sun was scorchingly hot.

145
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:03,330
They were nicely having a nice nap under the
tree and all that.

146
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:08,339
All the villagers arrived, everybody arrived,
everything worked out.

147
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,890
And when I got up it was about five-thirty,
then he told Me that, "Mother, I didn't tell

148
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,990
You the program."

149
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,230
He never tells Me.

150
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,160
If I get something written, well and good,
but, "You were sleeping, I didn't want to

151
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
disturb You."

152
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
"What's the program?"

153
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
"It was at three o'clock."

154
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
I said, "Three o'clock.

155
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Why didn't you tell Me?

156
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,350
Why didn't you wake Me?"

157
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,530
He said, "You were awake, I knew You were
awake, Mother.

158
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,530
It's all right."

159
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:38,840
So we started off at six o'clock.

160
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,950
Sun had gone down.

161
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:46,830
By that time they arranged beautiful lights
and fireworks and everything, and all the

162
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:50,610
rushing about was finished, they're very well
settled.

163
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,750
And the people from distant villages had also
arrived, and they had organized them so well,

164
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:00,860
and they had a proper time, and are very happy
that I came late because sun was not there,

165
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,210
so scorchingly hot.

166
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:09,000
By the time we reached about seven o'clock
it was night and they illumined the lights,

167
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,010
and the diwali like this was put up everywhere,
and they got everything, they had sufficient

168
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,899
time to do everything.

169
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:25,990
Then Dumahl said, "I knew, Mother, You are
awake, and You were managing."

170
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,980
If one can understand that, then you will
not try to organize Me.

171
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,550
You can just tell Me, "We have to leave at
this time."

172
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:39,730
But if I don't have to leave, I will not leave
whatever you may do.

173
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:48,380
In My own sweet way; you will never find Me
obstinate, but I am.

174
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,710
Because I know what is right is what is right,
and has to be done that way.

175
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:55,350
But otherwise I'm very calm, I am not bothered.

176
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:01,120
I never organize you, I never hurry you, I
never do anything that should upset you.

177
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:10,930
Spirit is never upset, never excited, never
hurries, and never is what you call that "go-go"

178
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,050
business.

179
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,880
Like now, we have to go to the airport.

180
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,900
You'll find everybody was like an aeroplane
- round, round, round, round.

181
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
What has happened?

182
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
"Oh, we had to go?

183
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,900
We'd.."

184
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,900
"We have to go, all right.

185
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
So what?"

186
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:31,079
The whole thing is, all these excitements
and all these things come to us because we

187
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,399
are outside.

188
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,310
But if you are one with your spirit you're
absolutely calm, absolutely calm, "All right,

189
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,910
we have to go, all right, we'll reach there.

190
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,320
Doesn't matter."

191
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,680
The other day we had to go for some shopping,
I was trying to buy some saris for Indian

192
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
ladies.

193
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,890
We got lost.

194
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,380
I never bothered them at all.

195
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,240
They were going round and round, and round
and round.

196
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,300
And then Danny realized and said, "I think
perhaps we had to leave vibrations in all

197
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,300
these places."

198
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,820
I said, "Correct."

199
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,770
And for about two hours I think, we were roaming
about.

200
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,769
Anybody else would be saying, "What's this?

201
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,620
You can't find the place, what's the matter
with you?”

202
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,620
Calm.

203
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,839
We reached the shop at the right time, got
everything at the right time, did everything,

204
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:14,130
came back at right time.

205
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,370
Everything was first class, nothing went wrong.

206
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:21,870
But anybody in My place, I tell you, that
time would have been, "Oh God, this, that."

207
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:22,870
Why are you saving time?

208
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:27,880
For what are you saving time?

209
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,920
So we miss the present, and that's one thing
spirit never misses.

210
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,870
It's always in the present.

211
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,630
That's the reality.

212
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:44,880
Now in the West people are very futuristic,
extremely futuristic, and their futuristicness

213
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,780
sometimes takes them to points, say for example
if they have to go by train.

214
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:54,100
So instead of arriving at the right station,
they'll go to the station which is further

215
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
on.

216
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,790
And then again they'll arrive at the further
on.

217
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,320
The train will never reach them.

218
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,940
Sort of temperament they have.

219
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:10,620
So one should not plan at all anything like
that, that fixes you.

220
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,570
But at this moment, if I have to be told that
we have to go at this time, is all right,

221
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,570
finished now.

222
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,720
At this moment I've told, is recorded, finished.

223
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
All right?

224
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,160
So it's gone into the memory.

225
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,830
There's nothing to worry about it now.

226
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,310
Now, present moment, what are we doing?

227
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,160
In a very calm way, witness it.

228
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,910
Witness yourself, now, witness yourself.

229
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,450
"Where is my mind going?"

230
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:41,920
Now somebody who has to cook must be thinking,
"Oh, I have to get this, I have to get that."

231
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,950
Once you start saying that "I have to do it",
you'll never be able to do it that way.

232
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:53,660
But you said, "All right, just now I'm in
meditation."

233
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:57,260
Every moment, "I am in meditation."

234
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:03,680
Everything will walk up to you, even matter,
and you'll get the right things at the right

235
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,250
place.

236
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:10,809
You'll meet right people at the right place.

237
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:14,220
The other day we were just walking, strolling
around.

238
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,220
Whom do we find there?

239
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,220
Carolyn.

240
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,010
She just walked out.

241
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,470
There is she, I mean I met her.

242
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,370
She said, "Christine is just next door."

243
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:29,580
I said, "Let's go," and you should have seen
the joy on her face when she came down, and

244
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,250
she saw Me.

245
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,770
Beautiful experience for Me and her, she was
so happy.

246
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:38,530
Then we went together.

247
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:45,530
So when you have so much tied down with your
watch, that means you are not tied down with

248
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,900
your spirit.

249
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:55,779
So a Sahaja yogi, if he sees watch, then he's
not a Sahaja yogi.

250
00:17:55,779 --> 00:18:00,950
But the other side could be that the Sahaja
yogis are never in time where they have to

251
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,570
be.

252
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,970
Very common in England.

253
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,880
I reach always first, to open the door.

254
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:16,060
And to clean it also sometimes.

255
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:24,059
Now, to take for granted things, as you say,
take for granted, that's not the way Sahaja

256
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,059
Yoga is.

257
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:27,929
You have to be alert, alert, absolutely alert.

258
00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:31,880
If you are alert, immediately you'll know
"I have to go now at this time.

259
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,140
I have to do it.

260
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,010
I have to get this thing now."

261
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,770
If you have to miss something, you are supposed
to miss it.

262
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,320
That's what it is.

263
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,559
So, there's a beautiful thing written down,
like they say, "Jai sei rakhahu tase hi rahun"

264
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,960
- "The way You keep me, the way I am, will
be happy."

265
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,559
So, satisfaction towards yourself, your spirit,
is important.

266
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:06,600
Because ego will plan out, "Oh, we'll go there,
we must get for Mother, say, daisies", we

267
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,600
decide.

268
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
"Must get daisies."

269
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,800
You don't find daisies, you're disappointed.

270
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Why not?

271
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,020
These are all My flowers, whether they are
daisies or not, they look so nice.

272
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,570
Whatever you get, you get it.

273
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:20,470
That's the thing wanted.

274
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:26,720
You know that, that the Divine is working
out everything for you.

275
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,370
When you are supposed to get something else,
better have it.

276
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:39,080
Even by mistake, if I lay My hand upon some
things, like a book or something, immediately

277
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,390
I'll open it out and see why this book has
come in My attention; why this fellow has

278
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,669
come in My attention; why this is happening.

279
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:53,651
And immediately I find that there’s some
connection, something has to be done, something

280
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:57,140
has to be said, something has to be worked
out.

281
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:08,520
So for a person who is imbibed with the culture
of spirit, the Sahaj culture, impresses others

282
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,600
by his calmness and relaxed attitude.

283
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,870
Relaxation never means lethargy, by any chance.

284
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,929
It doesn't mean lethargy.

285
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:21,880
Lethargy is against relaxation.

286
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:24,950
A person who is relaxed cannot become lethargic.

287
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:30,460
"Relaxed" means a person who’s alert and
calm.

288
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:42,580
These two things for human beings is an impossibility,
because if they are alert, if they are alert

289
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,830
then they're not calm.

290
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:51,000
If they're unhappy, sad, then they think they
are very, very calm.

291
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,780
So this is one of the things one has to remember,
that you have to witness yourself all the

292
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,690
time.

293
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,760
Not to condemn yourself, but witness.

294
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,299
Now I said the word "witness" means "detached".

295
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:08,781
Now what happens with this, when you start
condemning yourself, you miss every good point.

296
00:21:08,781 --> 00:21:20,270
For example, you have some experience of a
sudden height being achieved.

297
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,679
All right?

298
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:28,590
At that point you should catch hold of it,
hold on to it, keep doing, but don't forget

299
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,369
that you may go back, no.

300
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:36,460
And then wait for another higher moment to
come, hold on to it.

301
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,169
That's how you climb Himalayas.

302
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:41,500
But not that, "Oh Ma.

303
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,970
Now it's all right, but what will happen next?"

304
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:52,260
Then you are gone down, because you have to
face yourself in the way, knowing what are

305
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,260
your powers.

306
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,900
You are a spirit now, you are no more an ordinary
human being, so you have no business to condemn

307
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:04,059
yourself, or to degrade yourself, or in any
way to feel unhappy.

308
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,070
No way.

309
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,600
Past is past.

310
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,140
What happened a moment before is finished.

311
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,140
"Now I am going to rise.

312
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:15,520
Now I am going to rise."

313
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:27,850
So a person who has a Sahaja culture is not
only spontaneous, but is inspired, is a inspired

314
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,840
personality.

315
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:40,480
A person who is of that kind, an inspired
visionary, then other people get impressed

316
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:47,570
by such a person that, "See, there's a man
who's inspired, who talks in an inspired way,

317
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:52,080
in a way that is something very different
from others."

318
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,120
Something new he says, new that is nourishing.

319
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:05,200
Such a personality - like the other day, you
see, we heard the lectures of so many people,

320
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,669
and when the New Zealand Prime Minister was
coming C.P. said, "Now let's go back, because

321
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:13,090
we'll have a little tea or something."

322
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,919
I said: "No, you listen to this man.

323
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:15,919
He's a realized soul."

324
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:16,919
He said, "Really?"

325
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:18,230
I said, "Yes, you listen to him."

326
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:22,190
First everybody was, "He's sitting in New
Zealand, such a little titwit of a country,

327
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,110
what is he going to speak?"

328
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,080
You see, they were moving about, making a…

329
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,870
Within two minutes he captured everybody's
attention, you see, and he was bubbling with

330
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:37,559
everything, so beautifully, and he spoke all
the points so much different, and so much

331
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,070
new and so much better.

332
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:40,070
C.P.

333
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,070
was amazed.

334
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,070
He said, "How do You know?"

335
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:47,030
I said, "I know, because when I was in New
Zealand I told them he's a realized soul."

336
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,169
And our own Prime Minister is also a realized
soul.

337
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:54,740
You'll be surprised, after our Prime Minister
finished his lecture and all that, after two

338
00:23:54,740 --> 00:24:00,659
or three lectures he was to go; then he turned
round and went to this Australian [Shri Mataji

339
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:05,520
may have meant New Zealand] Prime Minister,
only him, went and congratulated him, congratulated

340
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
him.

341
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,330
Congratulated and said something very close
to him.

342
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:13,020
And the fellow again, you see, flew up into
joy.

343
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,799
We see it's all there.

344
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,700
And then he came away.

345
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,700
Why?

346
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:22,810
Because one realized soul understands another
realized soul, and everybody was amazed: why

347
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:26,950
did he turn to this man alone, and went and
congratulated him?

348
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:34,080
So such a large country like India represented
by our Prime Minister, goes down all the way

349
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,770
to a little country like New Zealand which
is nothing compared to India, and congratulates.

350
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,500
And that's a developed country, this is a
developing country.

351
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,050
Is something people did not understand.

352
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,700
And the whole joyous atmosphere both of them
shaking hands created.

353
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:58,280
This is Sahaja culture, in which you recognize
a realized soul, the dignity of a realized

354
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,550
soul.

355
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:05,770
So when it comes to relating to others, first
and foremost are Sahaja yogis.

356
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:13,169
But I've seen most of the people are more
congenial with others, and less congenial

357
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:15,980
with Sahaja yogis.

358
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:22,330
They try to criticize Sahaja yogis all the
time, and I test them.

359
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,700
I sometimes say, "All right.

360
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,030
I don't think this fellow is very good" and
all that.

361
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:31,370
But when the other person turns round and
shows compassion and says, "No, Mother, I

362
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:35,789
think it will work out" then I like it.

363
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:37,500
I like that.

364
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,840
Or else sometimes I say, "Oh, let them go
away.

365
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,140
There should be no more food for them, it's
all right."

366
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:47,820
No, Mother, we've made food for them."

367
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:52,190
So the culture of Sahaj is to give.

368
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:58,480
Give, and give, and give, and never ask for
a reward.

369
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,929
Never thinks, "What I have to get".

370
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:07,610
After all, you have got the highest that anybody
could get.

371
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:13,170
They said the three heights a human being
can achieve in spirituality, which you all

372
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,440
got in no time.

373
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,669
It's called as salokya, samipya, sanidya.

374
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:27,950
Salokya is that you should be able to see
God.

375
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:31,600
That you got.

376
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:38,780
Samipya is the closeness with God.

377
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:43,860
Sanidya is the togetherness, togetherness.

378
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:52,030
You have got all these three.

379
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:55,539
In one incarnation you've got it.

380
00:26:55,539 --> 00:27:08,800
When Gods incarnated before, nobody knew that
they were Gods.

381
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,520
So even they got it, they never knew.

382
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,270
Very few people knew about them.

383
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:27,600
But even when Christ said He was the Son of
God, who, how many believed Him?

384
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,030
They crucified Him.

385
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,330
Because they were not realized souls.

386
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:38,980
But by giving you realization I have given
you that capacity to get all these three blessings

387
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,980
at one shot.

388
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,940
I speak your language, I speak your style,
I live with your style, and you understand

389
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,940
Me.

390
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,150
There is no problem.

391
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:53,710
But with other Gods, imagine if I were Mahakali
today, what would have happened.

392
00:27:53,710 --> 00:28:00,870
You would be all upside-down there hanging,
seeing Me from the other way round.

393
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,350
I don't know what would have happened - or
any one of them.

394
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:16,059
So the three blessings that a saint is promised,
you've got all of them.

395
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:22,560
But because you've got them, you don't understand.

396
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,039
You take it for granted.

397
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:27,049
There's no shraddha.

398
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:35,760
With this experience there should be tremendous
faith.

399
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:43,669
Faith is a thing that resides between Me and
you, in between.

400
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:47,790
Is we can say, the ocean of joy that is in
between.

401
00:28:47,790 --> 00:29:00,049
Whatever I emit to you is that shraddha, and
when you are drenched into it, the joy of

402
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:08,940
that shraddha makes everything so sahaj.

403
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:15,970
But for that you must open your hearts.

404
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:25,690
A Sahaja yogi who is secretive, who is insular,
who is jealous, who separates himself from

405
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,669
others is no good.

406
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:31,720
Open your heart.

407
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:37,820
Give away your things, doesn't matter.

408
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:44,289
Matter has only one value, that it can communicate
your Sahaj culture.

409
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:59,370
Little things, you see, I see something that
you have got beautiful, and in My Mahamaya

410
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,730
acting on Myself I say, "Oh, that's very beautiful."

411
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:12,770
and then they say, "Mother, You gave us this."

412
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,640
"Ah, sorry."

413
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:21,020
And then I feel very ashamed of Myself, that
this is not Sahaj culture, you see.

414
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:24,820
But the joy is so much that I can't help it
sometimes I say, "Oh, I - it's so beautiful,

415
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,080
this one."

416
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,220
"You gave us, Mother."

417
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,260
And the whole rapport and the whole feeling;
I feeling a little shy about it, and all,

418
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:42,590
they're so beautiful, so dramatic; so dramatic
it is, so poetic.

419
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,870
Only at that point I feel ashamed of Myself.

420
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:52,440
Of course to be human being you should be
ashamed of yourself sometimes.

421
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,830
Otherwise the drama is not complete.

422
00:30:53,830 --> 00:31:00,490
So the whole thing is so beautiful and so
joyous.

423
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:05,600
But that gentleness towards others and yourself
should be there.

424
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,820
Now if you become unhappy and serious, you
are very unkind to yourself and to others.

425
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:17,710
Anybody who is a serious person, sits with
a serious face, know that he is not a Sahaja

426
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,270
yogi at all.

427
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,659
They should be bubbling with laughter, joy
all the time.

428
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:27,820
I cannot be serious for more than, I think,
five seconds perhaps.

429
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,230
I don't know.

430
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,630
I try, because lectures should be serious
to go into the hearts of the people.

431
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:41,500
But there's not, and you can see that even
when I'm getting angry, My eyes betray Me,

432
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:47,160
and there's a twinkle of laughter in the eyes.

433
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:52,580
That's how a person should be, and don't worry
what others have to say.

434
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:58,929
You see, the culture where people are just
glum like this, is the same as the people

435
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:00,350
where they are frivolous.

436
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:08,929
Now as we can say American culture is to be
frivolous, stupid, you see, I won't be surprised

437
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:11,170
supposing your Prime Minister tomorrow starts
wearing a sari, just to amuse you.

438
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:20,809
Anything is possible with them, just to amuse
you, you see, too - for cheap popularity.

439
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:22,950
Anything frivolous, stupid, they will do.

440
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:30,490
But supposing, you see, it is say an English
old conservative personality, then a lady

441
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:39,370
might wear a very official dress with the
lines and this and that, and like a man she

442
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:45,020
might become very soon, like that, develop
a very serious face.

443
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:48,830
But both things are nonsensical, has no meaning.

444
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:56,380
You have to be natural, and natural everything
is always bubbling with joy.

445
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,110
And a message.

446
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,110
And a message.

447
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:06,970
These flowers are the message of My coming,
writ large on them.

448
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:14,200
So a person who is a Sahaj culture man should
emit that message to others, people should

449
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,039
see, "Oh, this is the man.

450
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,570
He is the sahaja fellow."

451
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:19,570
You can see that clearly.

452
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,120
There's no seriousness, there's no unhappiness,
nothing.

453
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:27,200
Supposing I have said something that might
be upsetting you, forget it.

454
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,580
If you cannot forget that, then you have not
listened to Me.

455
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,510
But "forget" doesn't mean that you do not
act upon it.

456
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:42,419
"Acting upon it" means that you face yourself
and see for yourself how you have ascended

457
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:45,620
and how far you have to go, not how you'll
fall down.

458
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:51,380
So it is all the time acting on both sides,
as I'm telling you in My lecture, that on

459
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:57,690
one side you'll see to yourself as relationship
with Me, and relationship with others.

460
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:11,310
For a Sahaja yogi it should not matter whether
you are in a palace or on the street.

461
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:15,299
The first encounter with the first Sahaja
yogis - we have only one surviving, now here

462
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:22,809
sitting down - they couldn't bear, for them
it was difficult to be in the beautiful atmosphere

463
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:23,809
of India.

464
00:34:23,809 --> 00:34:29,760
The reason is, they were analyzing: they have
no good bathrooms, no showers.

465
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,159
But you have the whole sky.

466
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,799
You have all the mountains.

467
00:34:35,799 --> 00:34:37,119
You have all the trees.

468
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,129
You have got all the waters flowing.

469
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:46,879
But you want to have a little shower, in which
you can't even move.

470
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:53,559
Just an idea, just an idea of comfort.

471
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:59,480
You have no comforts, if you ask Me, compared
to what we have in India.

472
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,109
No comforts at all.

473
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:07,229
I mean, ask any Indian girl to come and stay,
she will cry.

474
00:35:07,229 --> 00:35:13,219
Even I think here the President, the President
has to wash his utensils perhaps, maybe.

475
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:15,380
What a comfort.

476
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,999
There's no division of labor.

477
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:23,700
Now in our country we have servants, but "servants"
doesn't mean that we cheat them anything else.

478
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,319
They eat the same food as we eat.

479
00:35:26,319 --> 00:35:28,200
They live the same way we live.

480
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,180
But they do different type of work, because
they don't have the same mental capacity to

481
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,440
be the President.

482
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,069
The President does some other work.

483
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:42,440
You have no comfort of any kind, you take
it from Me.

484
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:45,490
Food matter, you get everything processed
food.

485
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:50,489
Imagine, any time you might be developing
cancer due to processed food.

486
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:53,099
What is your speciality then?

487
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:54,839
Try to understand.

488
00:35:54,839 --> 00:36:00,000
What is the kind of food: it's not fresh,
God knows how it is processed, how it is preserved,

489
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,089
from where it is coming.

490
00:36:01,089 --> 00:36:07,180
Suddenly in London they said that, "Don't
eat this kind of food," you see, "because

491
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,529
it has got something contaminated."

492
00:36:09,529 --> 00:36:13,920
So everybody rushes, you see, to the store
room, because we have to store up all these

493
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
things.

494
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
You can't get at the right….

495
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,440
"Oh it's there"; then you start throwing them
out.

496
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:29,480
It's a mad racing because people think that,
"God knows what we are eating today, is it

497
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,670
correct or not?"

498
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:34,509
So food-wise you are zero.

499
00:36:34,509 --> 00:36:41,490
Best thing is to live in the villages or in
the forests, to get the fresh fruits, wash

500
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:51,529
them in clean flowing water of a river, eat
it nicely and sit down enjoying the sun.

501
00:36:51,529 --> 00:36:58,420
The comfort of the spirit is the thing we
have lost, and those who seek the comfort

502
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:04,349
of the spirit are Sahaja yogis, not otherwise.

503
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:08,249
Comfort of the spirit comes in giving.

504
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:15,529
Say I've borrowed some money from you, I won't
be comfortable till I've paid you back.

505
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:22,059
Going further with it, supposing you are caught
up into something, you have got some problems.

506
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:26,730
I'll somehow or other manage that you'll come
close to Me somewhere, and work it out on

507
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,440
you, clear you out, finished.

508
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,499
Till then I won't be comfortable; though I'll
suffer, I'll have pains, I'll have this, that.

509
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:37,299
As soon as I came here, left Nabhi was like
this going on.

510
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:38,299
Corrected it.

511
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:41,640
I took it upon Myself, I sucked it into Me.

512
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,930
So they are adventurous.

513
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:50,329
"Oh I will not touch, I am catching, he's
catching."

514
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:51,329
Finished.

515
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:55,920
But now the compassion can only work out if
you have that kind of a spirit, otherwise

516
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,069
you cannot.

517
00:37:57,069 --> 00:37:58,789
It becomes sympathy.

518
00:37:58,789 --> 00:38:04,410
For example there's one person, Mr. A. or
Miss A. or Mrs. A., whatever it is.

519
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:09,839
I mean, I'm just talking of a common personality,
and that person is catching.

520
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,800
I would say in an ashram, that person should
clear out.

521
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,099
But all the ashramites will catch from that
person, and that person will never be all

522
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:20,369
right.

523
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:23,210
There's a very nice joke about it.

524
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:26,690
There was a lady, she wanted to reduce herself.

525
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:29,029
So there was a machine like a rolling-pin.

526
00:38:29,029 --> 00:38:33,099
They said, "If you rub it, then you will reduce."

527
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:37,849
So she brought, poor thing, she brought the
machine and she started rolling it.

528
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:48,709
She found that the rolling-pin became fat,
instead of she reducing.

529
00:38:48,709 --> 00:38:53,059
Same thing is in Sahaja yoga.

530
00:38:53,059 --> 00:38:56,319
Instead of Sahaja yogis correcting the others,
they get contaminated.

531
00:38:56,319 --> 00:38:58,160
That's why I said, "Don't have anybody in
the ashram."

532
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,849
Because you sympathize.

533
00:39:01,849 --> 00:39:07,029
You do not try to correct that person, in
a way that you can correct within yourselves,

534
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:09,489
suck it within yourself as your Mother does,
and do it.

535
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:14,660
I do it for thousands and thousands and thousands;
you have to do it for one or two, so you are

536
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,660
never bothered.

537
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,269
And that's how you become strong.

538
00:39:17,269 --> 00:39:21,709
Not by shunning them, running away from them
or condemning yourself, or saying that: "We

539
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:26,029
must save ourselves on the boat."

540
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:27,029
No.

541
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:28,490
Through adventure.

542
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,380
"Let's see what happens".

543
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,229
Tamara was telling Me, "Nothing catches me,
Mother, what is it?"

544
00:39:33,229 --> 00:39:35,859
I said: "But who will catch you?

545
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:41,549
Those who will catch will be hurt themselves."

546
00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:45,030
So what is it, that Bhairava is to be established.

547
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:51,750
Sidha kala mane Bhairav' - as you have to
establish Shri Ganesha, you have to establish

548
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,509
also Bhairava, and Hanumana on the right side.

549
00:39:54,509 --> 00:40:00,440
If these three deities you establish within
yourself, nothing, nothing on this earth can

550
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
catch you.

551
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,000
You'll catch it for a while.

552
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,709
But what I find now, I came to this ashram,
everybody's left Nabhi caught up.

553
00:40:08,709 --> 00:40:13,249
Everybody's left Agnya caught up.

554
00:40:13,249 --> 00:40:14,789
So then I get the pain.

555
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:15,789
Everyone.

556
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:18,650
I mean, I have put you inside My body, do
you know that?

557
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:24,359
You are part and parcel of My body, you are
the cells in My body.

558
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:33,239
And when you catch, I also catch; not catch,
but I really get the pain, but I clear it.

559
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:36,170
In the same way, I have given you powers.

560
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:43,690
Every power I have, I have given you.

561
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:51,089
But you have to develop it and you have to
be adventurous.

562
00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:56,449
But on the contrary, once we have ashrams,
everybody settles down, "Oh, now, very comfortable,

563
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:57,449
very cheap."

564
00:40:57,449 --> 00:41:00,630
Very economical, that's the first comfort.

565
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:11,140
It's surprising, for a Western person, it
is very important that it should be economical,

566
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:19,509
surprising, affluent people think more of
saving money than the people who are poor.

567
00:41:19,509 --> 00:41:28,759
And English are the last word, save pounds,
at the cost of others.

568
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:32,440
On the contrary if you go to India, where
they’ll be very happy, they'll invite you

569
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,680
in their house.

570
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,279
Whatever they have they will give it to you,
"Eat, eat, eat."

571
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:38,279
They'll force you.

572
00:41:38,279 --> 00:41:40,029
They'll be very happy to give.

573
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:43,630
But in England it's very dangerous, you see.

574
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:47,049
Sometimes in the ashram they may not even
have food for Me.

575
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:48,739
Really.

576
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,479
And if you tell them, "I know.

577
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:52,479
I know."

578
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:53,479
You know.

579
00:41:53,479 --> 00:41:54,479
Finished.

580
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:55,479
Then what do you say?

581
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:57,029
They already know it, now what to do?

582
00:41:57,029 --> 00:41:58,160
They know.

583
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:06,329
So with the affluence miserliness grows, and
money-orientation.

584
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:11,749
In India also I've seen people who get little
more money than the rest become very money-oriented.

585
00:42:11,749 --> 00:42:16,619
Money becomes everything, money becomes the
power, money becomes their life.

586
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:20,420
Sahaja yogi doesn't care for money.

587
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:25,509
Just.. is the dust of our Mother's feet.

588
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:28,470
What is money, what is wealth?

589
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:33,750
And when they do like that, then their money
problems are solved.

590
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,699
If you have a money problem, know that there's
a problem.

591
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:42,729
If you are very particular about money.

592
00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:47,349
I am, in a way, because if I have to give
somebody, I remember it.

593
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:51,329
But I've seen people who are very anxious
to tell Me that, "You have to pay this man

594
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:52,329
so much, that man so much."

595
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:53,329
That's wrong.

596
00:42:53,329 --> 00:42:55,670
That's not your look-out.

597
00:42:55,670 --> 00:43:00,869
That's very, very wrong to tell Me that, "You
have to pay this man or that man."

598
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,730
It's not important.

599
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:06,479
Even if I don't pay, I pay him.

600
00:43:06,479 --> 00:43:12,400
So in relationship with Me, you are not to
tell Me that, "You have to pay so much money

601
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,460
to him, this much money should be paid, this
is what he owes You."

602
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,539
Nothing of the kind.

603
00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:20,059
Let the person come and tell Me.

604
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:21,410
Why are you telling?

605
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:26,069
That kind of a message if you give Me, you
are lost.

606
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:31,460
Or if you come and tell Me for somebody else
that, "Mother, time is up, we have to go.

607
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,709
Somebody is hurrying You up."

608
00:43:33,709 --> 00:43:40,069
If somebody is hurrying Me, tell him, "Don't
hurry Mother."

609
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:52,099
You must know that your kundalinis were not
raised with just your own kundalini, but something

610
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:53,869
that is working it out.

611
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:58,730
Something very tremendous, a big organization.

612
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:02,619
You can't see it, it is microscopic.

613
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:06,799
You must know, nobody got realization like
that, did they?

614
00:44:06,799 --> 00:44:08,999
Thousands getting realization, what's happening?

615
00:44:08,999 --> 00:44:11,369
There must be something about…

616
00:44:11,369 --> 00:44:16,589
Now how can you tell anything to such an organization?

617
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:17,589
They don't like it.

618
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:19,009
They know it.

619
00:44:19,009 --> 00:44:23,020
Actually they are the ones who know, not the
English.

620
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:26,019
They know what is to be done.

621
00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:32,849
So your relationship with Me acts as your
culture.

622
00:44:32,849 --> 00:44:39,299
So it is a Mother's cult, you can call it,
the Mother's culture.

623
00:44:39,299 --> 00:44:41,961
How we are connected with our Mother.

624
00:44:41,961 --> 00:44:48,759
I have seen people, if somebody is rude to
them, they get very angry.

625
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:52,170
But if somebody is rude to Me they don't feel
angry.

626
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:56,220
It should be the other way round.

627
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,380
Now I'll give you an example.

628
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:05,779
This Merv Griffin was funny, and both our
PRO’s were very angry.

629
00:45:05,779 --> 00:45:07,479
It was natural and very…

630
00:45:07,479 --> 00:45:10,619
I mean, I liked it, but I calmed them down.

631
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:12,769
And Worlikar of course was on top of this
thing.

632
00:45:12,769 --> 00:45:15,740
But the other fellow would not.

633
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:19,009
He was giving arguments.

634
00:45:19,009 --> 00:45:20,539
I was just watching.

635
00:45:20,539 --> 00:45:24,170
I mean, if somebody had said this to his mother...

636
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:32,220
There's another one there, he never came to
receive Me at the airport.

637
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:42,599
So Worlikar said, "If your own mother had
come, you would not have gone?"

638
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:46,519
Then one can give explanation, "Oh, but our
Mother is Adi Shakti.

639
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:48,739
My mother is not, she's helpless."

640
00:45:48,739 --> 00:45:49,739
It's not.

641
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:54,880
To show your respect, to show your love, you
have to go; for your own gain, not for Her

642
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,880
gain.

643
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,549
For your own gain.

644
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:03,190
This relationship is for your own gain.

645
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:12,809
Supposing if you strike oil, is it for your
gain or for the gain of the oil?

646
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:19,369
If you get to the Source, is it for the Source
to gain anything, or it is for you to gain

647
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:20,369
anything?

648
00:46:20,369 --> 00:46:23,150
Logic, simple logic.

649
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:32,309
So in that culture, you see, you really thrive
and you become extremely a happy person, a

650
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:34,829
joyous person.

651
00:46:34,829 --> 00:46:44,170
And the expression of such a person is so
different, because such a person, as I told

652
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:50,949
you, rises above and sees the problems of
others, the decadence of the society, sees

653
00:46:50,949 --> 00:46:56,259
all the problems of the world.

654
00:46:56,259 --> 00:47:00,000
Not only that, but knows the solutions.

655
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:09,809
We are not like these ordinary people who
have racialism, this.. other diseases, I don't

656
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:12,760
know what sort of diseases they have, I also
forget.

657
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,490
Racialism now, it's another stupid nonsense,
you know.

658
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:17,029
What is racialism?

659
00:47:17,029 --> 00:47:22,599
God has made somebody's color like this and
somebody's color like that, and those same

660
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:34,150
racists are trying to tan their faces.

661
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:41,079
So in this culture of ours we are not bothered
about superficial things.

662
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:50,059
What we are bothered about is our inner cleanliness,
inner beauty, but that doesn't mean that you

663
00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:55,859
should move about like primitive people, no.

664
00:47:55,859 --> 00:47:58,880
But if there is inner beauty, then outer beauty
comes.

665
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,459
You will never find Me dirtily dressed.

666
00:48:01,459 --> 00:48:07,079
You will never find Me without a sari on,
even when I sleep I wear a sari, because in

667
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:18,160
the night also I have to work, so how can
I go in My dressing-gown to the other world?

668
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:25,359
So a person who is a Sahaja yogi has to be
an extremely neat and a clean person, but

669
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,989
not to tell others, but should be himself
or herself.

670
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:33,769
That's one of the things are very important,
because others will see you, like loonies,

671
00:48:33,769 --> 00:48:36,119
who's going to believe you?

672
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:42,329
So the one effect is from the Mother, you
take from the Source, for what?

673
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:51,180
To be that illuminated quality, in you, so
that others see you as something great and

674
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:55,229
adore you, worship you.

675
00:48:55,229 --> 00:49:00,319
This is this far we have come, now, how your
personality should be.

676
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:06,259
But now, when you are dealing with others,
know that they are human beings made by God,

677
00:49:06,259 --> 00:49:11,349
not by Sahaja yogis by any chance.

678
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:16,200
And they will be tomorrow's Sahaja yogis,
may be higher Sahaja yogis than you.

679
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:23,049
So when we are dealing with others also, talk
to them in a gentle way.

680
00:49:23,049 --> 00:49:24,069
Be kind to them.

681
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:27,940
Of course we are against gurus, against cults,
against all these people.

682
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:35,479
But as soon as they come, if you say: "Oh,
you are a bhoot", the person will do right-about-turn

683
00:49:35,479 --> 00:49:39,369
and go away.

684
00:49:39,369 --> 00:49:50,150
So you are not given this power to be abrupt
or to be arrogant with others, not given.

685
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:57,859
Now all such people are coming down, calming
down because they see that what helps is your

686
00:49:57,859 --> 00:50:02,630
gentle, kindly, firm attitude.

687
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:05,609
Only after Sahaja Yoga you can combine all
these qualities.

688
00:50:05,609 --> 00:50:14,559
You'll be firm, you'll be alert, you'll be
gentle and compassionate, smiling, but not

689
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:16,359
making fun of others.

690
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:26,359
So then you become a personality who is alert:
to see what is the reaction they're having

691
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:29,319
on others, this is very important to be seen.

692
00:50:29,319 --> 00:50:32,689
So now you start witnessing others.

693
00:50:32,689 --> 00:50:34,839
What is your reaction on others?

694
00:50:34,839 --> 00:50:40,459
I have seen many a times, a new Sahaja yogi
comes in.

695
00:50:40,459 --> 00:50:47,529
The person is trying to say something, and
the girl starts giggling or laughing.

696
00:50:47,529 --> 00:50:52,420
One should not, at that time, because the
person might think that, "They're making fool

697
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:57,650
of me, or they're thinking that I'm a stupid
person, or something wrong with me."

698
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:01,449
That person will become self-conscious, I
won't be able to give realization to that

699
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:02,609
person.

700
00:51:02,609 --> 00:51:09,599
But if somebody is sitting before Me and I'm
trying to help that person, know that it's

701
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:16,109
a very important moment of this gentleman's
life.

702
00:51:16,109 --> 00:51:18,170
We have got it, so what?

703
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:25,259
When we are pulling out somebody, when we
are helping out somebody, do we laugh?

704
00:51:25,259 --> 00:51:34,170
That's the time you have to be very concerned
and very much serious, to do the job.

705
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:39,579
Every quality and mood has its own place,
like nose is at its own place, eyes at its

706
00:51:39,579 --> 00:51:40,579
own place.

707
00:51:40,579 --> 00:51:50,279
In the same way, all these moods that we have,
have their own places.

708
00:51:50,279 --> 00:51:55,979
And that is what is lost in modern society.

709
00:51:55,979 --> 00:52:03,099
So when I am trying to help somebody, you
should be all concern about that person.

710
00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:06,779
How does this come in to us from the Source?

711
00:52:06,779 --> 00:52:09,910
How much you are concerned about Me?

712
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:16,449
Supposing I am thirsty, you will feel thirsty.

713
00:52:16,449 --> 00:52:19,150
You'll immediately say, "Mother, I'll get
You some water."

714
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:23,219
But you may not even ask Me, just bring it
here, keep it there.

715
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:26,180
Or just make some tea for Me or look after
Me.

716
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,589
Do this or do that.

717
00:52:29,589 --> 00:52:32,769
In little, little things you should watch.

718
00:52:32,769 --> 00:52:36,410
The concern is not in saying something, asking
something.

719
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:37,880
You don't ask.

720
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:47,249
Don't ask Mother, you just do it.

721
00:52:47,249 --> 00:52:51,609
That's how, when you start doing it, you will
understand what you are doing to others.

722
00:52:51,609 --> 00:52:59,401
So the reflection on others, how they reflect
about you also is very important, and you

723
00:52:59,401 --> 00:53:03,449
have to be alert.

724
00:53:03,449 --> 00:53:06,489
Suddenly you say something, and everybody
disappears.

725
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:10,460
You must know they are not yet Sahaja yogis,
they are to be brought in, so you have to

726
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:16,790
very carefully bring them around.

727
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:23,809
Then with Sahaja yogis, among yourselves how
you behave is extremely important for others

728
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:25,769
to see.

729
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:33,660
We must cherish each other's company, we must
cherish.

730
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:38,450
To meet some Sahaja yogi somewhere, "Ah, what
a joy it is to see someone, to talk to someone

731
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:39,729
on the phone."

732
00:53:39,729 --> 00:53:46,900
But because we are so insular, so selfish,
so greedy, and sometimes very circumcised

733
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:55,779
[should read 'circumscribed'] I should say,
or absolutely engulfed into our past, we cannot

734
00:53:55,779 --> 00:54:02,479
do that, we do not feel that joy, we cannot
adore another Sahaja yogi, we do not enjoy

735
00:54:02,479 --> 00:54:08,069
another Sahaja yogi, we cannot cherish his
company.

736
00:54:08,069 --> 00:54:12,839
That means this finger cannot feel this finger.

737
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:17,790
It's like a developing, what you call, a disease
called leprosy.

738
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:20,400
Nerves are finished.

739
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,789
Nerve endings are not there.

740
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:31,739
You cannot feel the joy of other Sahaja yogis.

741
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:38,660
And this is only possible if you get over
your personal interests.

742
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:46,859
When people come in Sahaja Yoga in the beginning,
they have personal interests, like say somebody

743
00:54:46,859 --> 00:54:54,089
is trying to sell something, so they would
like to sell it to Sahaja yogis.

744
00:54:54,089 --> 00:54:58,680
Or they are arranging something, they would
like Sahaja yogis to do it.

745
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,630
See, personal interest, to use Sahaja yogis
for their own purposes.

746
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:11,499
As a result of that I've seen some people
become so insular that nobody helps them,

747
00:55:11,499 --> 00:55:15,819
no work is done by them; if there's a telephone,
nobody will say, "I'll get it."

748
00:55:15,819 --> 00:55:18,609
That's American quality, they'll say, "I'll
get it."

749
00:55:18,609 --> 00:55:20,380
Is regarded good.

750
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:27,049
Not in England, they'll be all sitting, quiet.

751
00:55:27,049 --> 00:55:32,239
Even when they have eaten the food, they have
to pay the money, they'll look this side,

752
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:36,739
and some poor Indian student will pay for
all of them.

753
00:55:36,739 --> 00:55:38,279
"I won't look", they say.

754
00:55:38,279 --> 00:55:39,279
"Now paid."

755
00:55:39,279 --> 00:55:40,559
Now they are normal.

756
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,749
It's very low-level.

757
00:55:44,749 --> 00:55:50,349
Is extremely low-level behavior.

758
00:55:50,349 --> 00:56:02,059
And this is what one has to learn, that you
have to cherish others, give presents to others.

759
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:11,049
"You're going there; “Oh, now…"; like
the other day I met a lady, she had liked

760
00:56:11,049 --> 00:56:15,759
one of My rings of emerald.

761
00:56:15,759 --> 00:56:22,219
That's My family ring so I can't give away,
you see, I'll have to ask C.P. and he may

762
00:56:22,219 --> 00:56:27,099
not like it, because after all I have no right
on it, I have to give it to My children, all

763
00:56:27,099 --> 00:56:28,099
right?

764
00:56:28,099 --> 00:56:32,189
But I found an emerald somewhere, beautiful,
so I kept it with Me.

765
00:56:32,189 --> 00:56:34,349
The other day when I gave her, she was so
enamored.

766
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:38,179
I said, "You liked My ring, I couldn't give
you My ring, so.."

767
00:56:38,179 --> 00:56:41,699
She said to Me, "You mean to say, I would
have taken Your ring?"

768
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:46,009
I said, "I would have forced it on you, but
I couldn't give you, so I thought of it.

769
00:56:46,009 --> 00:56:48,880
I just saw it somewhere so I got it for you."

770
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,880
She said, "How thoughtful."

771
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:53,209
But it's all in My head.

772
00:56:53,209 --> 00:57:02,719
I, whenever I get it, a chance, you see, so
somebody says, "Oh, I like it", keep it in

773
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,719
mind.

774
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:06,709
Next time, even a flower.

775
00:57:06,709 --> 00:57:11,599
You must cherish their companies, because
it's such a great thing to have somebody who

776
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,890
understands you, your spirit, and they have
the spirit.

777
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,630
Such a great thing.

778
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:21,829
How can you be unkind to each other?

779
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:24,009
That hurts Me the most of all.

780
00:57:24,009 --> 00:57:33,490
And the first thing and the foremost thing
you have to give Me is congenial, beautiful,

781
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:41,880
loving group, that they love each other.

782
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:46,199
If that's achieved, that you really love,
beyond your personal considerations.

783
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:53,729
I mean, of course, in Sahaja Yoga there are
now not many people who try to make money,

784
00:57:53,729 --> 00:57:55,859
but try to make comfort for themselves.

785
00:57:55,859 --> 00:57:59,319
They must have the best room, they must have
the best place, they must have...

786
00:57:59,319 --> 00:58:02,420
"I didn't get this, I should have it, this,
that."

787
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,789
Try to do more than others.

788
00:58:03,789 --> 00:58:09,980
I know sometimes people take advantage of
you, but they will go out of Sahaja Yoga very

789
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:10,980
soon.

790
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:15,420
So be sure that you become generous about
it, very generous.

791
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:26,880
And generosity should start from your own
Sahaja yogi brothers and sisters.

792
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:36,229
In the culture of Sahaja Yoga we have to have
a full imbibement bubbling through our nerves,

793
00:58:36,229 --> 00:58:40,130
the sense of chastity.

794
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:45,799
That is a must, whether you like it or not.

795
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:57,640
There should be no bad intentions about any
other person, of relationships which are not

796
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,640
pure.

797
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:11,059
Absolutely pure relationships, pure eyes without
any adultery, adulteration I would call it.

798
00:59:11,059 --> 00:59:20,640
Clean eyes is the basic of Sahaja Yoga.

799
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:27,489
Steadfast clean eyes, because your eyes are
very powerful.

800
00:59:27,489 --> 00:59:32,989
You don't know how powerful they are.

801
00:59:32,989 --> 00:59:44,670
So to make it that way, to practice, move
your attention inward and towards the Sahasrara.

802
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:45,670
You can.

803
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:50,219
With your eyes you suck in.

804
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:57,549
Even by looking at Me with the shraddha, with
the joy, you just suck it inside, My image.

805
00:59:57,549 --> 01:00:05,420
Put it on your Sahasrara, put it in your heart,
you can do it.

806
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:07,719
It's very joy giving.

807
01:00:07,719 --> 01:00:13,509
When you put it in the Sahasrara, then you
get the knowledge.

808
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:20,699
When you put it in your heart, you get the
joy; and when you put it on your liver, then

809
01:00:20,699 --> 01:00:26,049
you get the power of action.

810
01:00:26,049 --> 01:00:32,289
From the photograph also you can do it, suck
in, move it.

811
01:00:32,289 --> 01:00:43,249
But that is shown in the way you behave towards
others, completely confident, gentle; no arrogance.

812
01:00:43,249 --> 01:00:55,969
Neither the neck up like that or like that,
but in the center in a very dignified manner.

813
01:00:55,969 --> 01:01:10,319
So in the culture of Sahaj, because the spirit
is the dignity, is the majesty, is the glory

814
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:14,019
of God, you have to judge yourself.

815
01:01:14,019 --> 01:01:20,329
"Did I say something which is not respecting
my spirit?

816
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:27,209
Did I do something that is not glorious?"

817
01:01:27,209 --> 01:01:31,489
Like I've seen people, when I'm there, they'll
go on asking Me hundred questions.

818
01:01:31,489 --> 01:01:33,529
"Should it be white towel?

819
01:01:33,529 --> 01:01:34,529
Green towel?

820
01:01:34,529 --> 01:01:39,339
Should I do this, should I do that?"

821
01:01:39,339 --> 01:01:40,739
Why?

822
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,979
Because we don't live with choices.

823
01:01:42,979 --> 01:01:48,039
We live with whatever we get it, and there
is dignity in that.

824
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:54,469
If you start doing choices, it's stupid.

825
01:01:54,469 --> 01:01:59,220
In a group of Sahaja yogis, the food, "What
will you have?"

826
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:03,339
They'll take forty-five minutes to decide,
if you go in a restaurant, because the first,

827
01:02:03,339 --> 01:02:08,119
the consciousness, "We are paying for it",
and somebody will have this, somebody will

828
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:09,119
have that.

829
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:11,459
The poor waiter will run away.

830
01:02:11,459 --> 01:02:14,630
But why should we have different?

831
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:18,940
It's just the same.

832
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:26,349
Whatever Mother is having we'll have, finished.

833
01:02:26,349 --> 01:02:29,699
But if not that, at least whatever everybody
is having, "Why have separately?"

834
01:02:29,699 --> 01:02:34,150
Choices are not there in Sahaja Yoga, remember
this word very clearly.

835
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:37,900
Choices of this, choices of that, I don't
like it, I like that.

836
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:42,670
This is not good, that is not good.

837
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:50,789
Because we need everything on the level of
vibrations, then the choice is coming.

838
01:02:50,789 --> 01:03:00,549
Like, if the vibrations are not good we'll
not say it, but we'll not have it.

839
01:03:00,549 --> 01:03:05,559
But not question of whether green or red or
yellow or white.

840
01:03:05,559 --> 01:03:09,440
And that is what they are making fool out
of you.

841
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:15,079
They will put one name, Cartier, finished.

842
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:18,609
People will pay any amount for that Cartier.

843
01:03:18,609 --> 01:03:23,959
Is any ordinary stuff, it is nothing special.

844
01:03:23,959 --> 01:03:26,059
But you see that ego, "I've got the Cartier.

845
01:03:26,059 --> 01:03:31,329
I paid more to show that I've paid more, that
I've been a fool."

846
01:03:31,329 --> 01:03:39,459
To pay more for something that's so cheapish;
that's what they're playing upon - remember

847
01:03:39,459 --> 01:03:40,459
that.

848
01:03:40,459 --> 01:03:48,589
So you have to understand that when you are
a Sahaj personality, you have your own dignity.

849
01:03:48,589 --> 01:03:51,980
These things do not give dignity to you.

850
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:58,420
You give them dignity.

851
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:07,369
But that doesn't mean tomorrow you come like
a clown, or like a limbo on your nose.

852
01:04:07,369 --> 01:04:12,890
Of course I must see the other point always,
because it just slips out that side.

853
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:20,250
When you become dignified, you will wear always
something that is dignified.

854
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:22,039
You will do all that is dignified.

855
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:24,700
Is automatically you become dignified.

856
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:28,089
It's nothing artificial.

857
01:04:28,089 --> 01:04:35,709
So dignity that comes, as you see your Mother.

858
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:42,039
Whatever you give Me in Puja I take it, all
right, but otherwise you cannot give Me anything

859
01:04:42,039 --> 01:04:43,039
else.

860
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:49,279
If you give Me, I'll return it, somehow.

861
01:04:49,279 --> 01:04:52,489
Somehow I'll return it.

862
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:58,920
A person who is money-oriented cannot have
dignity, because you see him like a beggar.

863
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,040
See, if there’s money-orientation is too
much, he comes down to that level, you can

864
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:04,510
see it, there cannot be dignity there.

865
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:09,009
A man who is power-oriented is an idiot.

866
01:05:09,009 --> 01:05:11,700
He looks like an idiot.

867
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:13,169
So we cannot become idiots.

868
01:05:13,169 --> 01:05:14,169
All right.

869
01:05:14,169 --> 01:05:16,779
So we cannot be power-oriented.

870
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:24,970
The one who is sort of a romantic or a love-oriented,
is a stupid fellow.

871
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:27,259
He behaves like a stupid fellow.

872
01:05:27,259 --> 01:05:30,599
On the street they go on kissing each other
all the time.

873
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:32,160
"Where are you going?"

874
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:39,079
"To the divorce case, but last bit we are
thinking of having some kisses."

875
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:42,970
Self-respect is the thing.

876
01:05:42,970 --> 01:05:44,369
Self is your spirit.

877
01:05:44,369 --> 01:05:47,589
The respect of the spirit should give you
that dignity.

878
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:53,709
But in privacy you are gentle with your husband,
you are gentle with your wife.

879
01:05:53,709 --> 01:06:00,949
You must learn how to be gentle with her in
privacy, not in public.

880
01:06:00,949 --> 01:06:02,669
That's horrible.

881
01:06:02,669 --> 01:06:03,829
Specially in India.

882
01:06:03,829 --> 01:06:07,650
I am told that people go round with that romanticism
and all that.

883
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:13,989
So please, don't do all those romantic stuff
in India, it's very embarrassing for Me, very

884
01:06:13,989 --> 01:06:15,140
embarrassing.

885
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:20,140
So we cannot do things which embarrasses our
Mother.

886
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:24,919
Once you start knowing that, "This will embarrass
Mother, we can't do this", automatically you

887
01:06:24,919 --> 01:06:25,919
are helping.

888
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:32,400
So when it is related with Me, immediately,
"What will Mother think of in me?

889
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,519
Is this the way to behave towards Mother?"

890
01:06:34,519 --> 01:06:46,269
Immediately you will get the reward, as that
thing working through you, as if you become

891
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:47,390
that nature.

892
01:06:47,390 --> 01:06:50,789
Sahaja culture is a sahaja nature.

893
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:53,939
Automatically you will do it.

894
01:06:53,939 --> 01:07:00,910
You'll talk in that manner, you will speak
in that manner, you’ll live in that manner.

895
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:07,190
I mean, I have seen people who have never
known Me, on a trunk call or a telephone,

896
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:08,390
they recognize.

897
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:13,219
They know I am something special; if they
are sensitive enough.

898
01:07:13,219 --> 01:07:17,759
From My photograph, the way I sit, the way
I talk, immediately everyone asks.

899
01:07:17,759 --> 01:07:21,589
The other day where I went for the meeting
with My husband, everybody was asking, "Who

900
01:07:21,589 --> 01:07:22,589
is this lady?"

901
01:07:22,589 --> 01:07:23,589
"Who is this lady?"

902
01:07:23,589 --> 01:07:27,660
"Who is this lady?"

903
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,009
There's something in the personality.

904
01:07:29,009 --> 01:07:35,730
I talk to everyone nicely, I'm very sweet.

905
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:39,309
We cannot be slavish, and we cannot enslave
anyone.

906
01:07:39,309 --> 01:07:47,280
We have to cherish, even human beings we have
to cherish, because they are us.

907
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:53,140
Not to despise anyone, not to laugh at anyone.

908
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:59,720
In the culture of Sahaj, you have to become
an expert: expertise.

909
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:07,599
Expertise comes through your adherence to
your Mother.

910
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:12,279
Expertise: you all should be an expert, and
who will give you the certificate is your

911
01:08:12,279 --> 01:08:14,809
Mother only - who else?

912
01:08:14,809 --> 01:08:23,880
I may not say so, but your spirit will say
that, and not your ego.

913
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:30,159
In this short time whatever was possible,
it's such a big subject, culture is; you cannot.

914
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:36,949
But I've talked to you, I would not say in
a very analytical way, but in a very synthetic

915
01:08:36,949 --> 01:08:39,119
manner.

916
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:41,920
So I've given you very synthesis of the whole
thing.

917
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:48,779
"Analytical" would be one, two, three, four,
five - cut short - two, three, four, five,

918
01:08:48,779 --> 01:08:49,809
like that.

919
01:08:49,809 --> 01:08:51,889
It's not like that.

920
01:08:51,889 --> 01:08:54,250
And that is how you have to speak to people.

921
01:08:54,250 --> 01:08:59,199
One, this is so; two, this is so; three, this
is so; finished.

922
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:01,099
You are not Sahaja yogis.

923
01:09:01,099 --> 01:09:08,230
In your speeches if you talk like that, finished.

924
01:09:08,230 --> 01:09:14,299
But before saying something or doing something,
give a little idea where you are leading the

925
01:09:14,299 --> 01:09:20,579
people, so they are not frittered away, attention
is not frittered away.

926
01:09:20,579 --> 01:09:32,469
Give a little idea, as I say, or else while
talking, bring them to a point which is important,

927
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:38,350
so that they wait in the sentence to come
to that point.

928
01:09:38,350 --> 01:09:45,009
But make the whole sentence look so, that
it is going towards certain points, so always

929
01:09:45,009 --> 01:09:54,500
a Sahaja yogi must make a point out of what
they talk, not just babbling, talking.

930
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:58,489
What is the point you are going to make?

931
01:09:58,489 --> 01:10:04,000
Whatever they do, they have to know, "What
are we going to achieve out of it?"

932
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,179
Now, marriage.

933
01:10:05,179 --> 01:10:07,869
"What are we going to achieve out of marriage?"

934
01:10:07,869 --> 01:10:11,710
A family, house, everybody has, even a donkey
has that.

935
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,849
What's so great?

936
01:10:13,849 --> 01:10:19,570
We are going to achieve a family unit where
realized souls are to be born, we're going

937
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:31,340
to look after them in a proper way, and then
we are going to emit that unit into this world,

938
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:39,179
like a sparkling diamond set in the beautiful
setting of a family, giving light to the whole

939
01:10:39,179 --> 01:10:42,219
world.

940
01:10:42,219 --> 01:10:52,480
So one's life should not be pointless, and
talk should not be pointless, and every moment

941
01:10:52,480 --> 01:11:03,369
should be filled with achievements of your
visions and dreams, slowly and steadily, which

942
01:11:03,369 --> 01:11:09,210
is not at all difficult.

943
01:11:09,210 --> 01:11:15,469
If you can get rid of ego and superego, finished,
that's all - simple as that.

944
01:11:15,469 --> 01:11:25,570
May God bless you all.

945
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:35,659
Mm.. good.. nice.. relaxed, eh?

946
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:37,679
Relaxed.

947
01:11:37,679 --> 01:11:39,699
Witness.

948
01:11:39,699 --> 01:11:49,250
Everyone cleared out, I think.

949
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:50,250
And no more…

950
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:56,409
one more thing I must say last, as I've said
it before, which I've not said here, no-one

951
01:11:56,409 --> 01:12:01,640
is going to say that bhoot did it, because
such a person will be sent away to the bhoot

952
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:05,030
clan, not to Sahaja Yoga.

953
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:09,989
Don't put your responsibility on the bhoots.

954
01:12:09,989 --> 01:12:14,860
Either you are a bhoot or you are a Sahaja
yogi, one of the two, you can't be both.
