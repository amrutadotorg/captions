00:31.834 --> 00:41.149
I’m sorry what has happened yesterday, but I think the war has begun between the evil and good

00:41.149 --> 00:46.699
and after all the good prevails.

00:46.699 --> 01:00.431
In these modern times, evil used to prevail on good but now in this Krita Yuga,

01:00.431 --> 01:12.462
the evil will be completely conquered by good, and not only that, but good will spread all over.

01:23.809 --> 01:39.040
The evil has the capacity to go to extremes and then to fall out of the evolutionary process completely.

01:40.615 --> 01:52.664
Because they are blind they cannot see the good that’s why they are evil.

01:54.722 --> 02:02.276
If they could see the good they would give up their evil.

02:02.276 --> 02:11.053
In our country which is a country of yoga, especially Maharastra which is the country of the saints,

02:11.053 --> 02:17.219
I was amazed to hear what people are up to.

02:17.229 --> 02:25.960
One of the real source of this nonsense seems to be Rajneesh, the horrible fellow, because

02:25.970 --> 02:34.519
he has made an exhibition here absolutely denouncing all the deities and saying all

02:34.529 --> 02:41.159
kinds of dirty things, and I think the chief
minister of this place is also hand in glove

02:41.169 --> 02:48.950
with him and they are all trying to prove that there is no God, there is no spirituality.

02:48.960 --> 02:58.989
They want to establish that science is everything.

02:58.999 --> 03:07.680
We have no heritage of science in India, we have the heritage of spirituality.

03:07.690 --> 03:16.890
I mean nobody is known as such a great scientist
in this country.

03:16.900 --> 03:26.560
Nobody has made any special inventions and the way people are organising it in the name

03:26.570 --> 03:32.370
of science, there is hardly anyone who has done anything of science.

03:32.380 --> 03:39.669
So it’s the evil which has taken this new form of talking about science and denouncing God

03:39.669 --> 03:45.726
Of course in the West also the same thing has happened to a great extent but not to that extent.

03:45.726 --> 03:51.214
They have not discarded everything that was spiritual.

03:51.543 --> 03:57.981
But here they have gone headlong, those few people who are there, very, very few, but they are there.

03:57.981 --> 04:06.121
So it’s a very bad growth in this country, it won’t survive I know, it cannot survive

04:06.121 --> 04:09.859
because this country is so full of spirituality.

04:09.859 --> 04:17.392
In the West, because people took to science, they have lost all culture of society.

04:17.392 --> 04:21.369
There is no culture of society.

04:21.369 --> 04:27.869
The etiquettes are limited to fork and spoon or how you wish each other.

04:27.869 --> 04:29.751
There is no other culture.

04:29.751 --> 04:33.591
It’s so outside, there is nothing deep really.

04:33.591 --> 04:41.203
Because they have taken absolutely to the modern, or we can say that

04:41.203 --> 04:55.904
it's the industrial evolution of the people, they have taken to all that and have lost contact with reality.

04:56.451 --> 05:05.963
The culture of any country can only survive on spirituality.

05:05.963 --> 05:19.610
Science cannot talk of this and it has so many limitations that it cannot even answer simple few questions that are facing them.

05:19.610 --> 05:34.673
Above all they have no idea what is love, they have no idea what is the all pervading Power.

05:34.673 --> 05:41.254
Now you all have felt it, and you know what it is, and you know how to use it.

05:41.254 --> 05:44.402
So, under these circumstances I find

05:44.402 --> 05:55.860
that those people who are mediocres in Sahaja Yoga cannot help much  for establishing goodness.

05:55.860 --> 06:01.620
You have to be very clean within yourself, you have to be very powerful within yourself

06:01.620 --> 06:04.955
and you have to be extremely sensitive.

06:04.955 --> 06:12.595
So, we are not to waste our energy, our attention onto superficial and nonsensical things.

06:12.595 --> 06:18.407
We have to get out of it and we have to become
people who are detached,

06:18.407 --> 06:21.406
detached from any things which create problems.

06:21.406 --> 06:31.924
If you take a detached view of everything you will have a kind of

06:31.924 --> 06:42.064
a life that will nourish your society which is now sick, is a sick society, is a decadent society.

06:42.064 --> 06:48.448
And for that decadent society you need people who are very morally strong,

06:48.448 --> 06:55.172
who are tremendously pure and who know everything about Sahaja Yoga.

06:55.800 --> 07:01.682
The mediocrity in Sahaja Yoga is very common in the West, very common.

07:01.682 --> 07:06.580
And so much involved into their personal problems that

07:06.580 --> 07:16.854
I cannot understand how will they rise above this nonsensical, personal viewpoint of view.

07:17.239 --> 07:23.149
So, one has to realise that the whole tree that has grown outside so much

07:23.149 --> 07:29.726
due to industrial revolution has to seek its own nourishment

07:29.726 --> 07:34.052
from spirituality which is in India. No doubt.

07:34.464 --> 07:40.901
Spirituality without development has no meaning.

07:41.220 --> 07:46.838
Spirituality has to have development outside otherwise it is lost in the Mother Earth.

07:46.838 --> 07:52.754
It has to sprout and it has to show results, which we are showing no doubt.

07:52.754 --> 07:57.040
In so many ways Indian Sahaja Yogis are trying to show that,

07:57.040 --> 08:00.415
though they are rather slow about that point.

08:00.415 --> 08:05.671
So, it’s something funny that in the West people are rather slow,

08:05.671 --> 08:10.570
Sahaja Yogis are rather slow about their spirituality,

08:10.570 --> 08:19.068
and in India people are rather slow about their manifestation outside.

08:22.193 --> 08:26.330
Unless and until we really do some dedicated effort

08:26.330 --> 08:29.958
it’s not going to work out.

08:29.958 --> 08:36.804
So I hope as we have circulated letters that we have come here

08:36.804 --> 08:45.400
not for fun but for dedication and for our ascent and it’s a pilgrimage.

08:46.673 --> 08:55.472
Talking loose, talking about small things, quarrelling with each other

08:55.472 --> 09:01.828
is out of question of course. But domination, terrible domination

09:01.828 --> 09:06.718
of falsehood, just to think that you are leaders,

09:06.718 --> 09:13.958
or, "Why is he leader?" you know, shows that we are not yet worthy.

09:13.958 --> 09:21.418
So, the worthiness of a ship is very important if it has to fight the turbulence of the sea.

09:21.418 --> 09:28.282
If it cannot fight the turbulence of the sea then it is definitely not seaworthy

09:28.282 --> 09:33.459
and it is absolutely useless because it cannot go across.

09:33.459 --> 09:36.363
In the same way, if you have to be something,

09:36.363 --> 09:40.636
you have to work it out in such a manner that you really become worthy

09:40.636 --> 09:47.276
of crossing this ocean of illusion and that many could cross with you.

09:48.979 --> 09:55.513
As in India they have started at every place,
at every home, at every family, a center.

09:56.281 --> 09:59.580
If they invite people, they talk about nothing
but Sahaja Yoga.

09:59.580 --> 10:05.505
Now you can go all out to talk about it, I give you permission to tell them that I have come

10:05.505 --> 10:08.210
there’s nothing to hide.

10:08.220 --> 10:16.882
And you have to go and open the doors

10:16.882 --> 10:25.943
of many churches and many temples and many organisations and tell them that I am there.

10:25.943 --> 10:29.843
Now the time has come, you can see it so clearly, it’s so obvious.

10:30.284 --> 10:35.264
First, I used to say, "I would not go to the newspapers, this not good that’s not good,

10:35.264 --> 10:37.200
let us work it out."

10:37.200 --> 10:40.698
But it has come now so much, that I have to say things and I am going to say them,

10:40.698 --> 10:44.654
very openly, I am going to say them.

10:44.654 --> 10:47.671
But I want all of you to be such

10:47.671 --> 10:58.574
that nobody should point out a finger at you to say, "Oh, this is a Sahaja Yogi.

10:58.574 --> 11:02.705
And how this Sahaja Yogi is behaving."

11:02.705 --> 11:10.857
If somebody is stupid and not working it out, it's better to get rid of such a person.

11:10.857 --> 11:15.641
Or else help that person and tell him that, "You have to come up.

11:15.641 --> 11:19.303
You can’t be here, we don’t want mediocre people here.

11:19.303 --> 11:26.131
We want some very extraordinarily, pure people.“

11:26.131 --> 11:29.169
The purity is the main point which we have to have.

11:29.169 --> 11:32.770
Once you are pure you don’t have to worry, then I look after you.

11:32.770 --> 11:40.746
But the purity of mind, purity of heart and the purity of your attention, these three things are very important.

11:41.026 --> 11:46.500
When it works out, you’ll be surprised collectivity will grow in no time.

11:46.500 --> 11:53.396
Is a tendency among Sahaja Yogis also, still, to go back to the same materialism

11:53.396 --> 11:59.541
and to try to have your own house, your family, your
children- sort of a nonsense.

11:59.541 --> 12:04.249
We have to be in the ashrams and we have to work it out,

12:04.249 --> 12:08.961
we have to work it out very beautifully that we all live very happily in the ashram.

12:09.040 --> 12:15.970
But I find still people cannot work it out that way.

12:17.110 --> 12:20.823
They are more concerned about their jobs, concerned about their things.

12:20.823 --> 12:24.623
Once you live in the ashram I’ll see that you get everything.

12:24.857 --> 12:33.267
But if you do not want to have the blessings
of God, how can anybody help you?

12:33.267 --> 12:35.857
So, tremendous sacrifice is needed.

12:35.857 --> 12:39.603
Of course, as you know in Sahaja Yoga I don’t need any money from you at all,

12:39.745 --> 12:47.138
but sacrifice is very important, and sacrifice of nonsensical ideas that you have.

12:47.877 --> 12:51.219
In every way we have to show that we are Sahaja
Yogis.

12:51.219 --> 12:55.038
The way you dress up, the way you live, the way you think, the way you behave,

12:55.038 --> 12:57.294
the way you have relationships with each other

12:57.294 --> 12:59.972
and the way you lead your married life

12:59.972 --> 13:04.944
and the way you look at your children.

13:06.749 --> 13:12.311
Unless and until you have purity the light of love will not shine,

13:12.311 --> 13:15.491
the light of love will not shine.

13:15.491 --> 13:20.850
You have to absorb the light of love within yourself.

13:21.040 --> 13:24.971
But you cannot unless and until you are a pure personality.

13:24.971 --> 13:32.808
And that pure personality has to develop by your meditation, by working hard, it’s a question of few years.

13:32.808 --> 13:36.648
In ten years we can change the whole world,
in ten years!

13:36.648 --> 13:39.360
But you have to be really very dedicated.

13:45.253 --> 13:49.914
It is you who has to change, not Me.

13:49.914 --> 13:53.794
You have to work it out, not Me.

13:54.356 --> 14:00.046
I have done my level best but within ten years it should be possible that every Sahaja Yogi

14:00.046 --> 14:03.625
should become a tremendous force of Sahaja Yoga.

14:03.625 --> 14:07.135
So, please try to avoid all those who are mediocres.

14:07.135 --> 14:13.287
If you find mediocrity, the leaders must go all out to correct them,

14:13.287 --> 14:16.051
all out to tell them off. Don’t tolerate.

14:16.051 --> 14:20.530
You don’t have to be very mild on this point.

14:20.530 --> 14:27.261
You have to tell them frankly that, "See now, you are an extremely mediocre person for Sahaja Yoga.

14:27.261 --> 14:30.545
It's not meant for mediocres.

14:30.545 --> 14:34.574
It's not meant for foolish people, it's not meant for stupid people,

14:34.574 --> 14:42.034
it’s meant for something who are ready to sacrifice anything for the sake of truth.“

14:42.213 --> 14:46.583
These people are saying that, "Why don’t you go the way of science?"

14:46.583 --> 14:51.291
I say, "Why don’t you go the way of truth?"

14:51.291 --> 14:53.491
Take to truth.

14:53.491 --> 14:58.213
Science is not truth. Today it might appear, tomorrow it disappears.

14:58.810 --> 15:02.712
Today you may think it is correct but every hypothesis is challenged,

15:02.712 --> 15:07.476
every law is challenged, that’s no law.

15:07.869 --> 15:11.592
You have to use Sahaja Yoga in every practical life, everywhere.

15:11.592 --> 15:14.212
But in no way you have to be fanatic about it.

15:14.334 --> 15:19.536
Like I have seen some people start giving vibrations

15:19.536 --> 15:25.710
or they start moving their hands for bandhans,

15:25.710 --> 15:28.519
even if I am sitting, they are doing like that.

15:28.519 --> 15:36.319
There is no stupidity about it, it has to be very dignified, decent and decorous.

15:38.069 --> 15:43.595
But for that we need really people of quality.

15:43.595 --> 15:48.062
And a complete obedience is needed I must say.

15:48.623 --> 15:54.646
I have told Indian people that time that they must have a proper case done for them.

15:54.646 --> 15:57.846
They just didn’t listen to Me that time, they said, "Mother, why do you want,

15:57.846 --> 16:00.254
you know, you'll be in trouble and all that".

16:00.437 --> 16:05.017
If they had listened to Me there would have been no trouble today.

16:06.402 --> 16:11.346
But you must listen to Me what I say, don’t give Me explanations, don’t give Me logic,

16:11.346 --> 16:14.126
but I know everything you know that.

16:14.126 --> 16:18.559
I know everything.

16:18.776 --> 16:22.976
Now we have something good for you is the list of the marriages.

16:22.976 --> 16:27.636
But marriage is not such an important thing that you think about.

16:28.750 --> 16:34.100
It’s not such an important thing for you that you dedicate all your attention to that.

16:34.100 --> 16:38.244
It’s just by the way, because you have to have a marriage, that’s why.

16:38.244 --> 16:41.104
There’s no need even to have sometimes.

16:41.619 --> 16:49.356
But you have to have it, and then letters after letters about your marriages, about your children, I just don’t want to read that.

16:49.635 --> 16:53.543
Nothing about Sahaja Yoga.

16:54.871 --> 16:59.841
If you are detached, whatever may be the quality of your wife, you will not fall,

16:59.841 --> 17:02.734
whatever may be the quality of your husband, you will not fall.

17:02.913 --> 17:12.150
So one has to be little concerned that: what are we doing?

17:12.150 --> 17:14.671
What have we achieved?

17:15.040 --> 17:20.799
What are we going to give to the world?

17:25.096 --> 17:31.060
For Me, you are my instruments. I don’t have to ask anybody else.

17:31.060 --> 17:34.652
You are my instruments and you have to work it out.

17:34.652 --> 17:40.143
You are not for Me useless people, I worked very hard with you, very hard.

17:40.294 --> 17:43.675
So please don’t waste my energies also

17:43.675 --> 17:50.194
and try to become very good Sahaja Yogis in every way that is possible,

17:50.194 --> 17:56.559
in every way you should be dedicated, in every way try to be something

17:56.559 --> 17:58.529
of very great qualities.

17:58.529 --> 18:03.090
Now you have seen how people have becoming violent and there is a violence on.

18:03.090 --> 18:08.529
Of course, this may not continue but it’s one of the signs that we have to be prepared

18:08.529 --> 18:14.462
to be very strong people, very strong,

18:14.462 --> 18:16.232
and that will work out I’m sure.

18:16.232 --> 18:22.130
They threw about 400 stones at least, maybe more according to the police report

18:22.130 --> 18:24.737
and very few people were hurt.

18:25.140 --> 18:27.040
What does that mean?

18:27.040 --> 18:32.209
That there is somebody who is avoiding all these troubles.

18:36.201 --> 18:40.979
Regarding our tour further, now I have decided we will not go to Atith

18:40.979 --> 18:45.602
because there are- the commissioner, the ESP told Me that it is better not to go,

18:45.602 --> 18:49.018
it's very- these people are very bad and they are criminals.

18:49.018 --> 18:52.908
So, now until the election comes in, they will be behaving like this manner.

18:53.198 --> 18:56.343
After the election of course they will be put down.

18:56.343 --> 19:02.849
So you should go by the understanding of the time and

19:02.849 --> 19:07.779
directly to Sangli, so we’ll go to Sangli, we will have a puja there, you can do shopping whatever you like

19:07.779 --> 19:13.979
and then from there will be going to Ganapatipule.

19:13.979 --> 19:18.365
But it’s not fun, it’s not fun.

19:18.365 --> 19:22.640
It is our development.

19:22.640 --> 19:27.755
Otherwise you will be coming to India, going back the same, empty handed.

19:28.260 --> 19:34.078
I want you, everyone, to be extremely active in your own sphere of life,

19:34.078 --> 19:35.068
talk about Sahaja Yoga.

19:35.068 --> 19:40.577
You must wear my badges, you must wear my rings, you must wear my necklaces

19:40.577 --> 19:46.949
so that people ask you “Who is this?” Then you should say, “She is the Holy Ghost”.

19:46.949 --> 19:50.304
You can say, "We think she is the Holy Ghost".

19:50.304 --> 19:52.610
Let us see what happens.

19:56.210 --> 20:00.727
So, it’s a serious thing that I felt that I have to talk to you

20:00.727 --> 20:07.130
and that we have to be very, very careful about how we look at ourselves.

20:07.130 --> 20:11.429
We have to be aware, we have to be aware about ourselves and what is happening.

20:11.429 --> 20:15.273
I’ve been telling you this many a times, we have to be aware as to what we are

20:15.273 --> 20:16.408
and what is happening.

20:16.408 --> 20:22.827
But if your jobs are important, everything else is important how are you going to work out Sahaja Yoga?

20:24.873 --> 20:28.842
So, there has to be awareness and with your awareness the light will spread.

20:28.842 --> 20:32.212
But it’s not silent, you have to talk about it.

20:34.271 --> 20:39.986
Eloquence is needed, it has to be eloquent, all your light has to talk,

20:39.986 --> 20:46.456
the light has to say, the light has to express and has to
be very confidently done.

20:47.000 --> 20:54.385
Let us see now after going from this tour how far people establish new things.

20:54.675 --> 21:01.030
So far, what my own opinion is,  that there are 50% of Sahaja Yogis

21:01.030 --> 21:04.741
in the West are still quite mediocre

21:04.741 --> 21:08.864
and 25% of them are just there to take advantage.

21:08.864 --> 21:12.301
If they can get something free, they would like to do it.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.712
25% people are like that.

21:14.712 --> 21:18.094
It’s very sad but it is so.

21:18.094 --> 21:23.367
But I must say Indians are poor people but
they will not do anything,

21:23.367 --> 21:27.120
they will never take anything free from Me, nothing.

21:27.130 --> 21:29.995
They will not, they are very self-respecting.

21:29.995 --> 21:32.426
And that is what we have to develop, that self-respect.

21:33.250 --> 21:37.961
Like I have seen I had a house in Hounslow, everybody went there and stayed there free.

21:37.961 --> 21:41.534
Now we have a house there in Shuddy Camp where
everybody goes,

21:41.534 --> 21:45.529
who has no job goes and stays there. It’s such a nonsensical thing.

21:45.529 --> 21:50.676
So, I’m even afraid to start any ashram in London because same thing will start.

21:50.676 --> 21:53.832
If they can take advantage they would like to be there.

21:53.832 --> 21:56.543
Even a spoon they would like to carry like that.

21:56.778 --> 22:00.297
It’s a shameless thing for a Sahaja Yogi to behave like that I think.

22:00.447 --> 22:09.257
We have to have full self-respect and we must understand that we have to sacrifice, to do something about it.

22:11.512 --> 22:15.395
Because this is the last leg, I would say, when I will be talking to you about all these things

22:15.395 --> 22:24.366
and in the beautiful atmosphere here on the bank of Krishna river.

22:25.133 --> 22:31.785
We have to understand that the river flows, it makes a sound,

22:31.785 --> 22:35.890
it makes a sound to show that she- it exists.

22:36.808 --> 22:44.128
But we are not only rivers, we are all the mountains, rivers, everything of the universe we are.

22:44.419 --> 22:52.500
And our manifestation is like a big zero as if the Mother Earth has been emptied out.

22:53.510 --> 23:00.673
It is time that we should watch ourselves and see ourselves, what’s wrong with us.

23:00.673 --> 23:02.076
Very important.

23:02.076 --> 23:08.284
I had to say this once again and again,

23:08.284 --> 23:12.122
but I don’t like to say these things because I love you so much

23:12.122 --> 23:16.003
and I care for you so much and you people also love Me.

23:16.003 --> 23:20.103
But loving Me is not sufficient, you have to love yourself and respect yourself.

23:20.385 --> 23:22.784
Only your Self is going to work out.

23:23.019 --> 23:26.618
As Shivaji Maharaj said, "Swa-dharma rajya"

23:26.618 --> 23:31.873
"You must develop the religion of your Spirit".

23:32.164 --> 23:37.066
That’s what we have to do, is to develop the religion of our Spirit.

23:37.066 --> 23:46.441
And once it happens, we can get the whole world completely emancipated.

23:46.441 --> 23:53.143
This is our work and if we fail then it is the responsibility of Sahaja Yogis and nobody else

23:53.143 --> 24:00.073
So, for everyone I have to tell you that I don’t have to please you, you have to please me.

24:03.040 --> 24:09.040
For a small thing people react, for a small thing they feel bad.

24:09.040 --> 24:12.849
If I don’t smile at somebody they feel bad.

24:12.849 --> 24:16.536
In little, little things they feel bad and they react.

24:16.536 --> 24:19.012
If I say anything, they react.

24:19.012 --> 24:21.242
So how can anything go into you?

24:21.365 --> 24:25.585
If it is such a convexity, how will you absorb it?

24:25.585 --> 24:32.113
It is important that we should try to absorb
with humility, with understanding.

24:32.113 --> 24:35.427
Now you are Sahaja Yogis, you know I am Adi Shakti,

24:35.427 --> 24:38.352
you have had photographs, you have known that I am Adi Shakti.

24:38.352 --> 24:40.500
But how much are we absorbing?

24:40.500 --> 24:42.498
How much we are taking within ourselves?

24:42.498 --> 24:47.250
This work is much more than any one of the incarnations had to do.

24:47.250 --> 24:52.117
It's much more than Christ, is much more than Rama, much more than Shri Krishna’s.

24:52.548 --> 24:56.533
So create such great people among you.

24:56.533 --> 25:02.557
Because I have the power, only thing, you have to have the absorption power,

25:02.557 --> 25:04.233
the acceptability.

25:04.233 --> 25:10.064
But if you run after something very cheapish and something very frivolous, it’s impossible.

25:10.887 --> 25:19.594
You have to ask for your depth and you have to take in, whatever is emitting from my being.

25:19.594 --> 25:23.029
I hope now you all will take it up seriously.

25:23.029 --> 25:26.319
Do your meditation every morning whatever maybe the time.

25:26.319 --> 25:32.880
Every morning we have to do the meditation and we have to see that we finish our work in the night

25:32.880 --> 25:36.228
and then we do little meditation and then sleep off.

25:36.228 --> 25:42.981
Without meditation you cannot grow and that’s why everything doing you have to know that you have to get up in the morning,

25:42.981 --> 25:46.941
do your meditation and then you can take to your work.

25:46.941 --> 25:49.660
Daytime if you want, you can rest for a while.

25:49.660 --> 25:53.768
Now we are in such a place that we have time to rest for a while,

25:53.768 --> 25:56.895
but morning time you have to get up whatever time you sleep.

25:56.895 --> 26:01.262
You have to conquer your sleep a little bit, it gives you lot of lethargy.

26:01.262 --> 26:06.212
Last night I don’t think I slept before 3 o’clock or something like that

26:06.212 --> 26:10.191
and then the whole day I’ve been busy writing reports, this, that.

26:10.364 --> 26:15.944
If I can manage at this age, at your age you should be able to manage something like that.

26:16.095 --> 26:21.146
We have no time to sleep, we have no time to discuss, argue or to eat our food.

26:21.408 --> 26:26.282
We have only time to meditate, that’s all.

26:26.798 --> 26:33.318
I wish all of you absorb my saying and understand it without reacting to it.

26:33.318 --> 26:34.701
Please do not react.

26:34.701 --> 26:37.529
Don’t think, "Mother is trying to chastise you". No.

26:37.529 --> 26:42.790
I’m trying to help you to grow, this is the way you grow sometimes very fast.

26:42.790 --> 26:46.474
So it’s just your growth I am worried about and nothing else.

26:46.474 --> 26:47.893
May God bless you all.

26:47.893 --> 26:52.992
I was very happy the way you were singing all the songs and the way you expressed yourselves.
