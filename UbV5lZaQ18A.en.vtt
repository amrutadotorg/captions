00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:16.370
All right. First I would like to tell you about

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.855
the meaning of puja.

00:00:22.027 --> 00:00:23.808
There are two aspects.

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:37.168
One is the aspect that you have got your own deities within yourself.

00:00:37.395 --> 00:00:41.230
And these deities are to be awakened within you.

00:00:41.387 --> 00:00:45.517
Deities are the different aspects of one God.

00:00:45.637 --> 00:00:50.485
So on one side you have the Deities, means the aspects of God,

00:00:50.686 --> 00:00:53.166
which are all the time awakened.

00:00:53.406 --> 00:00:58.406
On the other side you have your own Deities,

00:00:58.606 --> 00:01:03.046
which are sometimes awakened, sometimes half-awakened,

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:08.194
sometimes sleeping and sometimes sick.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.350
So you have to use two methods:

00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:21.311
one to please the Deities

00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:23.831
of God,

00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:28.191
and to ask them to bless your Deities,

00:01:28.391 --> 00:01:33.694
or to ask them to awaken your Deities.

00:01:33.814 --> 00:01:39.374
So by doing the puja, means when you offer anything

00:01:39.573 --> 00:01:42.579
that you have got to offer,

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:46.979
anything that you offer is - say, flowers,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.929
if you want to offer flower to God, you don't have to speak anything,

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:55.089
you have to just offer, that "this is for You."

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.790
Anybody can understand offering,

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.353
for that you don't have to have even a tongue.

00:02:01.473 --> 00:02:04.953
Even if a blind man is there, if he wants to give you something,

00:02:05.153 --> 00:02:06.993
he can just give you like this.

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:09.473
And that expression is sufficient

00:02:09.673 --> 00:02:12.153
for anybody to be convinced that he can offer it.

00:02:12.353 --> 00:02:14.650
You don't have to say anything about it.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.970
So now, when you offer a flower to God,

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:22.449
even if you don't say a mantra

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:26.689
it is offered - all right, it's given.

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:32.183
But whether it is accepted or not is a problem.

00:02:32.504 --> 00:02:36.824
But now, when you are a realized soul and you offer anything,

00:02:37.025 --> 00:02:41.165
it is acceptable to God even if you don't say anything.

00:02:41.285 --> 00:02:46.314
But what about you getting any reward out of it?

00:02:46.434 --> 00:02:51.822
After realization when you offer anything to God, He accepts,

00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:56.079
because it's coming from a realized soul, so He accepts.

00:02:56.199 --> 00:03:01.279
Now, how do we get

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:07.040
blessed by Him, by giving a flower to God?

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.504
Now if you don't say anything about it,

00:03:09.624 --> 00:03:12.126
you just offer a flower,

00:03:12.246 --> 00:03:16.329
then you might be rewarded with many flowers

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:20.072
automatically in life.

00:03:20.192 --> 00:03:23.947
Or you may be, whatever material things you offer,

00:03:24.067 --> 00:03:26.704
you may be blessed materially.

00:03:26.824 --> 00:03:30.915
Then in a subtler way if you say something,

00:03:31.035 --> 00:03:34.158
as you say for offering somebody

00:03:34.278 --> 00:03:36.970
that humble way of saying that

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.439
"I'll be happy if You would accept this,"

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:45.642
will be even subtler results of that maybe,

00:03:45.762 --> 00:03:51.650
which could be much wider, maybe much deeper.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.369
Now, you do something symbolic

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.611
which is very, the essence, the principle of something.

00:03:58.731 --> 00:04:01.322
Like flowers are the -

00:04:01.442 --> 00:04:04.728
they represent the principle of the Mother Earth.

00:04:04.848 --> 00:04:06.248
Now,

00:04:06.448 --> 00:04:11.415
so the symbolicism of all the things

00:04:11.535 --> 00:04:15.415
that we can offer to God has been meditated upon,

00:04:15.616 --> 00:04:17.884
and has been found out.

00:04:18.004 --> 00:04:22.134
So they use five things called as panchamruta,

00:04:22.254 --> 00:04:24.603
Because if you have hit the principle,

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:27.790
then you have really hit the whole, isn't it.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.345
Because spiritual well-being is a total well-being.

00:04:32.465 --> 00:04:35.063
It's not just partly that your material well-being

00:04:35.183 --> 00:04:38.111
or your physical well-being, or your emotional well-being,

00:04:38.231 --> 00:04:39.876
or your mental well-being.

00:04:39.996 --> 00:04:44.494
It's a total one, completely balanced into totality.

00:04:44.614 --> 00:04:51.051
Now when you offer these other things like the,

00:04:56.215 --> 00:04:59.043
we call them akshadas,

00:05:02.841 --> 00:05:05.634
what do you call ?

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.103
Turmeric. Turmeric rice, you see, this yellow thing, you see.

00:05:11.223 --> 00:05:13.454
When you offer this, you know, the yellow color

00:05:13.574 --> 00:05:16.361
is that of the Swadisthana Chakra.

00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:20.056
And rice is very dear to all the gods.

00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:23.697
Now there's a trick in it, because it's a human trick.

00:05:23.817 --> 00:05:26.001
Gods are fond of rice.

00:05:26.121 --> 00:05:28.158
So they put turmeric on it,

00:05:28.278 --> 00:05:32.611
means that "We offer to You a rice which is yellow-colored"

00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:38.658
- means, "You should give us blessings of our creativity."

00:05:38.778 --> 00:05:41.572
When you eat it, more creativity will flow

00:05:41.692 --> 00:05:45.408
and we'll be blessed by that deity - it's a trick.

00:05:45.528 --> 00:05:50.173
The whole thing of puja is the trick of human saints, you see,

00:05:50.293 --> 00:05:54.681
how to trick God to give more blessings!

00:05:54.801 --> 00:05:58.884
But whatever God likes, it has to be auspicious and holy.

00:05:59.004 --> 00:06:01.595
So ultimately it works out for the

00:06:01.715 --> 00:06:06.829
holiness of saints and their simple hearts.

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:11.275
Now, the puja cannot be done by a person who is not a realized soul.

00:06:11.395 --> 00:06:14.478
A person who preaches also has to be a realized soul,

00:06:14.598 --> 00:06:17.783
the one who does namaz has to be a realized soul,

00:06:17.903 --> 00:06:20.689
the one who prays has to be a realized soul.

00:06:20.809 --> 00:06:25.118
So all the utensils that are used are to be worshipped in a way

00:06:25.238 --> 00:06:28.501
that they are to be holy things,

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:30.376
they are to be respected things.

00:06:30.496 --> 00:06:34.103
You cannot use anything, say the one you are using in the bathroom

00:06:34.223 --> 00:06:37.618
and you use the same thing for the puja, is absurd.

00:06:37.738 --> 00:06:39.548
Three things are very important,

00:06:39.668 --> 00:06:42.548
is a ghatah, means [UNCLEAR] the vessel,

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:45.634
vessel that contains the kundalini,

00:06:45.754 --> 00:06:49.014
the vessel that contains the

00:06:49.215 --> 00:06:53.564
primordial desire within us to get to God,

00:06:53.684 --> 00:06:55.939
is first to be worshipped, our desire.

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:58.673
Is the ghatah, is the one made here.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:01.634
And on top is called as a Shriphala.

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:05.322
Shriphala means this also has got water in it, if you  see,

00:07:05.442 --> 00:07:11.804
the coconut represents the same thing.

00:07:12.535 --> 00:07:16.720
Now in the subtler form it is

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.783
the water of all the rivers of the world.

00:07:21.903 --> 00:07:26.368
And the coconut is the water of all the oceans.

00:07:26.488 --> 00:07:29.540
The water from the ocean or sea

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:34.134
rises through the tree-trunk of the coconut,

00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:38.767
and becomes the sweet water in the coconut.

00:07:38.887 --> 00:07:41.517
It's a symbolic thing.

00:07:41.637 --> 00:07:46.090
So this is the vessel called ghatah-puja, this is the ghatah-puja.

00:07:47.418 --> 00:07:51.439
Now, I don't want to go to details today, because we have to talk about Ganesha.

00:07:51.559 --> 00:07:55.001
The same is - now that is water, all right.

00:07:55.121 --> 00:08:00.548
Then we have to worship Ghanta (bell) and Shankha (shell).

00:08:00.668 --> 00:08:03.837
These are two representing the sound. Shell.

00:08:03.957 --> 00:08:08.165
Actually the Shankha represents the ether.

00:08:08.285 --> 00:08:11.165
Then we have the Deepa, means what?

00:08:11.285 --> 00:08:16.696
It's the light, represents the light element, called as tejas.

00:08:16.816 --> 00:08:21.689
Normally also to the Goddess they also give Her a fan,

00:08:21.809 --> 00:08:24.712
which represents the air element.

00:08:24.832 --> 00:08:28.142
So this is how all the five elements

00:08:28.262 --> 00:08:32.892
are pleased beforehand, using them.

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:37.814
So the essences of these or the causal essences

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:40.806
of these five elements

00:08:40.926 --> 00:08:43.009
should be pleased at this time,

00:08:43.129 --> 00:08:46.329
Now there are also all kinds of other things,

00:08:46.449 --> 00:08:51.244
like your family deities, you might be

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.564
worshipping in your family some deities.

00:08:53.684 --> 00:08:57.361
They should not be also at this time upsetting the puja;

00:08:57.481 --> 00:09:00.439
or maybe the forefathers who are dead.

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:02.759
All these things are to be quietened,

00:09:02.879 --> 00:09:06.095
so that they should be told that this is a puja like this,

00:09:06.215 --> 00:09:08.451
and you do not disturb us at this time.

00:09:08.571 --> 00:09:10.697
Means even thoughts should not come,

00:09:10.817 --> 00:09:13.189
their thoughts or their - any disturbances.

00:09:13.309 --> 00:09:17.009
So everything is to be first made into peace.

00:09:17.129 --> 00:09:20.001
Now this is the one aspect I have told you in short,

00:09:20.121 --> 00:09:22.876
because it's a very long thing. If I have to speak about it

00:09:22.996 --> 00:09:25.322
I'll have to speak at least three times,

00:09:25.442 --> 00:09:30.056
and with three hours each time, still it may not be finished.

00:09:30.176 --> 00:09:32.306
Now we come to the second aspect,

00:09:32.426 --> 00:09:34.736
which question I asked you "What do you,

00:09:34.856 --> 00:09:37.783
how do you get benefited by it?"

00:09:37.903 --> 00:09:43.894
So apart from this technique, to have the best

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:47.598
effect of the blessings

00:09:47.718 --> 00:09:53.658
or the best flow of the Grace within us,

00:09:53.778 --> 00:09:56.290
we say mantras.

00:09:56.410 --> 00:09:59.668
The sound of mantras,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.673
the sound, the sound echoes

00:10:07.793 --> 00:10:12.111
into the being of God.

00:10:12.231 --> 00:10:15.978
And they are re-echoed on our chakras,

00:10:16.098 --> 00:10:19.501
and then the chakras start opening more.

00:10:19.621 --> 00:10:24.103
So the flow of the Grace of God is received.

00:10:24.223 --> 00:10:27.986
But only a realized soul should chant a mantra.

00:10:28.106 --> 00:10:32.275
Because without connection, how will it reach God?

00:10:32.395 --> 00:10:34.009
It is a vicious circle.

00:10:34.129 --> 00:10:37.665
Now one may say that "Mother, you cannot get realization

00:10:37.785 --> 00:10:40.642
unless and until you get the Grace of God.

00:10:40.762 --> 00:10:45.853
And the chakras won't open by a person who is not a realized soul.

00:10:45.973 --> 00:10:49.236
And without opening the chakras you cannot get realization."

00:10:49.356 --> 00:10:54.025
That's how the play of the Mother comes in,

00:10:54.145 --> 00:10:57.259
and of all the saints, like you.

00:10:57.379 --> 00:11:02.978
I would say the Sahaja yogis have to break this vicious circle.

00:11:03.098 --> 00:11:06.134
You have to raise the kundalini yourself.

00:11:06.254 --> 00:11:09.126
Once you raise the kundalini, the kundalini opens

00:11:09.246 --> 00:11:11.244
the chakras a little bit,

00:11:11.364 --> 00:11:15.298
because you have given your vibrations to the chakras.

00:11:15.418 --> 00:11:18.611
So once she knows there is a Sahaja yogi standing

00:11:18.731 --> 00:11:22.134
behind the seeker, she rises.

00:11:22.254 --> 00:11:25.267
She knows you are her brothers and sisters,

00:11:25.387 --> 00:11:29.204
and that you belong to the same family as she does.

00:11:29.324 --> 00:11:32.072
She knows the land where she has to grow, you see,

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:36.423
so she can feel that, and then she rises in her dignity.

00:11:36.543 --> 00:11:39.197
That's how she breaks this vicious circle.

00:11:39.317 --> 00:11:44.525
That's why in the beginning we don't tell them about the mantras,

00:11:44.645 --> 00:11:49.603
because in the mantras you have to accept Me as the Deity.

00:11:49.723 --> 00:11:54.314
In this advent of Mine it is made compulsory

00:11:54.434 --> 00:11:57.895
that you have to recognize Me.

00:11:58.207 --> 00:12:00.712
Because this is very precarious,

00:12:00.832 --> 00:12:02.892
the Resurrection Time we can call it,

00:12:03.012 --> 00:12:06.267
or the time of your Last Judgment.

00:12:06.387 --> 00:12:08.900
First the realization has to be given

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.134
without any recognition.

00:12:12.254 --> 00:12:16.744
But not to those who are denying or insulting Me.

00:12:16.864 --> 00:12:19.579
Under any circumstances they cannot get realization,

00:12:19.699 --> 00:12:22.033
whatever you may try.

00:12:22.153 --> 00:12:26.197
Even after realization if people start thinking against Me,

00:12:26.317 --> 00:12:28.181
vibrations will stop,

00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:29.783
because of Sahasrara.

00:12:29.903 --> 00:12:33.345
And the heart has to be

00:12:33.465 --> 00:12:37.111
completely in unison with Me,

00:12:37.231 --> 00:12:41.212
otherwise Sahasrara is closed.

00:12:41.332 --> 00:12:45.454
Now those people who are simple,

00:12:45.574 --> 00:12:50.158
who are full of open heart, you see,

00:12:50.278 --> 00:12:53.283
such people understand Me very well and

00:12:53.403 --> 00:12:56.822
they just put Me in their hearts.

00:12:56.942 --> 00:12:58.392
After realization,

00:12:58.512 --> 00:13:02.759
after going through the understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:08.033
through their mental activity, also the intellectuals understand Me

00:13:08.153 --> 00:13:13.231
and recognize Me in a little circuitous way.

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:18.181
After the puja, when they receive the blessings,

00:13:18.301 --> 00:13:21.564
a very blissful state they achieve,

00:13:21.684 --> 00:13:27.450
then they realize the value of puja also - afterwards.

00:13:28.465 --> 00:13:32.851
Now in India, where the puja system has been traditionally coming

00:13:32.971 --> 00:13:35.290
and has been maintained quite a lot,

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:39.556
they understand it without any mental processes.

00:13:39.676 --> 00:13:42.494
But when they meet somebody, an intellectual,

00:13:42.614 --> 00:13:45.294
who has become a Sahaja yogi, you see

00:13:46.014 --> 00:13:48.908
they can't understand them.

00:13:49.028 --> 00:13:51.064
They don't want to listen about it,

00:13:51.184 --> 00:13:55.486
the whole rigmarole of the whole movement of the brain.

00:13:55.606 --> 00:13:58.769
And some of them who try, you see, a little westernized,

00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:02.119
they try, you see; they develop an inferiority complex,

00:14:02.239 --> 00:14:04.204
and they go to the left side.

00:14:04.324 --> 00:14:07.619
But there is no need to understand it with mental,

00:14:07.739 --> 00:14:12.400
I mean, to all the time analyzing through your mental process,

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.876
and then to understand everything,

00:14:14.996 --> 00:14:20.650
and then become Sahaja yogis with the heart open.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:23.484
This is rather very circuitous. But what to do?

00:14:23.605 --> 00:14:27.228
They have gone that way, so they have to come that way.

00:14:27.348 --> 00:14:30.333
Because even if they become Sahaja yogis,

00:14:30.453 --> 00:14:33.538
they start questioning and thinking about it,

00:14:33.658 --> 00:14:36.369
and worrying about it.

00:14:36.489 --> 00:14:40.040
So the false people just mesmerize them

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.954
and take advantage of that mesmerism.

00:14:43.074 --> 00:14:46.900
So one should not feel bad.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:51.415
If you feel like analyzing, you should go ahead with it,

00:14:51.535 --> 00:14:55.400
because I cannot stop your speed,

00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.236
I'm not going to mesmerize you.

00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:03.369
In Sahaja Yoga the freedom is to be respected.

00:15:03.489 --> 00:15:07.306
But we do not allow people to come for puja

00:15:07.426 --> 00:15:10.494
who have not achieved a certain amount

00:15:10.614 --> 00:15:16.329
of understanding mentally of Sahaja Yoga

00:15:16.449 --> 00:15:18.634
- from the Western people, not in India,

00:15:18.754 --> 00:15:21.251
but here there is a restriction.

00:15:21.371 --> 00:15:27.158
Because supposing in India I do not explain to them,

00:15:27.278 --> 00:15:31.720
they don't want to know. They know that they'll get vibrations.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.533
They already know about vibrations,

00:15:33.653 --> 00:15:36.642
so I don't have to tell them "You will get more vibrations."

00:15:36.762 --> 00:15:39.259
If they get more vibrations they know I am the Shakti,

00:15:39.379 --> 00:15:42.556
that's all, I don't have to explain it.

00:15:42.676 --> 00:15:45.970
Like as you can make out which is the best wine,

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:49.322
they can make out who is the real person.

00:15:49.442 --> 00:15:51.431
They know the taste of it.

00:15:51.551 --> 00:15:54.892
Now, once in a puja

00:15:55.012 --> 00:15:58.017
I had about six thousand people that touched My Feet.

00:15:58.137 --> 00:16:01.119
So I said, "In a puja now, please don't have

00:16:01.239 --> 00:16:04.173
- the people need not touch My Feet." I said it.

00:16:04.293 --> 00:16:06.900
But they thought it was Dhumal who suggested,

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.845
so they all got after his life.

00:16:09.965 --> 00:16:12.869
They said, "You only want to take all the blessings

00:16:12.989 --> 00:16:15.876
from Mother's Feet, and you didn't want us to take it",

00:16:15.996 --> 00:16:17.775
and they got after him.

00:16:17.895 --> 00:16:20.408
Another thing is, you see, in the West

00:16:20.528 --> 00:16:25.244
I never used to make the panchamruta with My Feet but with My Hands,

00:16:25.364 --> 00:16:29.869
because here people would think that that's a dirty thing feet is,

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:32.392
and we should not have of the feet, you see.

00:16:32.512 --> 00:16:34.720
But actually the Feet are very powerful,

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.775
and they can never be dirty.

00:16:37.895 --> 00:16:40.329
Like the River Ganges has vibrations.

00:16:40.449 --> 00:16:42.014
If you have the water of Ganges

00:16:42.134 --> 00:16:44.814
you will see that it will never be dirtied.

00:16:44.934 --> 00:16:47.556
On the contrary, whatever are inside that

00:16:47.676 --> 00:16:50.369
because it's never sort of very kept clean,

00:16:50.489 --> 00:16:53.322
whatever dirt has gone into it,

00:16:53.442 --> 00:16:56.572
it settles down and doesn't dirty the thing at all.

00:16:56.692 --> 00:17:00.040
It's very clean water, all the time vibrating.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.431
So one must understand whatever is pure,

00:17:04.551 --> 00:17:07.220
which is responsible for purity,

00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.767
which is the source of purity,

00:17:09.887 --> 00:17:13.454
can cleanse any impurity. So how it can be impure?

00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:16.556
But with the brain if you think it, it's so limited.

00:17:16.676 --> 00:17:19.204
You cannot think of something which is just

00:17:19.324 --> 00:17:21.251
the embodiment of purity.

00:17:21.371 --> 00:17:24.001
This is the point we have come now,

00:17:24.121 --> 00:17:27.853
where I think I should talk about the Absolute.

00:17:27.973 --> 00:17:29.493
That is Shri Ganesha.
