00:00:00,165 --> 00:00:03,444
Shri Lalita & Shri Chakra Puja, Brahmapuri (India), 17 Decembre 1990.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,240
The knowledge about Kundalini

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:15,320
has been expressed in many Sanskrit Shastras since long

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,760
and also in Ayurveda it is described, not only that

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:32,960
but the books which are for curriculum talk about Kundalini and the chakras,

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,080
because Ayurveda is very, very close to Sahaja Yoga.

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,960
Even in the western medicine to begin with,

8
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:53,920
you should see the history they took to -dealt with three doshas.

9
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:04,040
They dealt with three problems that we have as in Ayurveda.

10
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,920
The right side which has got Pitta means bile;

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,440
left side which has got Kapha means phlegm,

12
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:24,120
and the central part, the problems of vayu means the gases.

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,800
Now luckily so many western people have taken to Sahaja Yoga

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,800
and have tried to bring down all the permutations and combinations

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,920
to the simple reasoning of left, right and centre.

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:53,560
But the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga is absolutely basics;

17
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:01,240
even in Ayurveda is one step away from reality,

18
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,960
of which it says the fundamentals.

19
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,520
So you are dealing with the fundamentals of which a human being is built.

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,840
And if this knowledge was found out long time back in India,

21
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,880
should we not accept it?

22
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,000
The reason why people went into meditation in those days

23
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,440
and found out all these deeper things within ourselves,

24
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,600
because they didn’t have to fight the nature.

25
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,920
You have seen here nature how beautiful it is.

26
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,880
You can spend all your life under a tree,

27
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,800
while in the West, even before getting out of the house you have to take

28
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,560
at least 15 to 20 minutes to be prepared to go out.

29
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,960
It’s quite a struggle.

30
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,640
So the nature has been so kind and that is the reason people took to meditation

31
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,600
and found out all these deeper things within themselves.

32
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:19,760
When they found it out it was all written in Sanskrit language.

33
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,360
I have such a big thick book on this, which has described all the Shakti,

34
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:38,160
Pithas and all the Shri Chakras, Brahma chakra, lalita chakras and all that.

35
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,520
But this was just written down, but hardly any person got realisation.

36
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,640
But in any other language like Marathi or Hindi

37
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,960
which was spoken and written by common people nothing was done.

38
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,360
Nobody knew about it; only a few people who read about it.

39
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,920
Especially the Shaiwas, they went into the research

40
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
and they went into the world.

41
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,280
But very few people really got realisation; very, very few.

42
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:28,520
Then in the 12th century, only the Nath Panthis, who were experts of Sanskrit,

43
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,800
who were following it rigidly,

44
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,840
that one master, should have one disciple not more than that.

45
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,600
This was their tradition.

46
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:45,480
But in the 12th century Gyanadeva,Gyaneshwara, who was another Nath Panthi,

47
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,400
his guru was his own brother,

48
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,440
he asked the permission from his brother that please allow me

49
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,440
to say all these things openly.

50
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,440
At least to say in Marathi language

51
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,120
because the common people don’t know anything about this knowledge.

52
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:25,320
So he allowed him and he wrote the 6th chapter of Gyanaeshwari

53
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,720
in which he described Kundalini.

54
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,800
But it was in the 12th century.

55
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,000
After that many saints described and talked about it.

56
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,400
Where we went yesterday to Satara,

57
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,040
you know that’s the place where Shri Ramdasa lived.

58
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,440
He said that Kundalini -there somebody asked him

59
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,760
“How much time does it take to raise the Kundalini?" –

60
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,240
he said that Tatshan. Means that moment.

61
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,320
But the person who wants to take it should be deserving

62
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,760
and the one who wants to give should be capable.

63
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,560
It's a big condition.

64
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,000
This is such a big if- a capital if I tell you.

65
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,160
As a result very, very few peop1e got their realisation,

66
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,320
and those who were born as realised souls

67
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,760
found it impossible to talk to people.

68
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,440
Gyaneshwara, such an enlightened soul himself

69
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,960
wrote one beautiful book called “Amruta Anubhav”

70
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,960
which I will try to translate,

71
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,840
which is very joy giving. To me at least it’s very great joy giving.

72
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,720
He went so deep into the understanding of this joy.

73
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,480
I wish English language would provide me that subtlety to translate that book.

74
00:06:53,080 --> 00:07:05,160
That he wrote all these things when he was only 23 years of age

75
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:13,960
and at the age of 23 years he got so fed up that he took a living Samadhi

76
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,320
that is he entered into a cave and killed himself.

77
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,440
They all tortured him very much.

78
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,200
Nowadays this 'Andha Shraddha', stupid thing, is not tortured as much,

79
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,680
but all these saints in this country

80
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,920
or any country have been very much tortured,

81
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,040
and there was no police protection.

82
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:48,000
There was no one to publish about what these people are up to.

83
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,120
Despite all that, I find there are many Sahaja Yogis

84
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,160
who are now occupying very big positions in the government

85
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,880
and a day may come when everything will explode.

86
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,640
The biggest problem of our country is something you cannot understand

87
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,800
because you don’t have this problem.

88
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,240
The amount of corruption we have from A to Z for everything.

89
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,040
That you cannot understand, I mean I have never known any country

90
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,280
where they have this to such an extent.

91
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Even say in Philippines, it was only one person who was doing it.

92
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,400
Here every person has to get the money

93
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,840
and has to pay the money to hire Johns.

94
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,080
For this also unless and until you get to Sahaja Yoga it won' t work out.

95
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,120
And Sahaja Yoga can only be worked out

96
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:17,320
if people understand that it is their heritage

97
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,200
and that they have the capacity

98
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,960
to understand Sahaja Yoga and capability to spread it.

99
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,920
In north India it is much better,

100
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,720
although the vibrations in Maharashtra are much better;

101
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,560
it is something funny.

102
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,480
Vibrations in Maharashtra are very good.

103
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,160
The people in the north India are very good Sahaja Yogis

104
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,480
and they are many, many, many in number.

105
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,160
We can' t say, even in Bombay we get about 12000 people for my programmes,

106
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:01,320
but still the way it is spreading in North India is very surprising.

107
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,360
Also it is spreading.

108
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:15,920
This is Satara because it was blessed by Ramdasa, this district.

109
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,280
I think everywhere there is a flower there has to be thorns

110
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,920
and this district has got some really very bad culprits.

111
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,360
Ahmednagar is much better.

112
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,040
Aurangabad we are doing much better;

113
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,520
it will work out in Aurangabad much better.

114
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,080
And then if you go to the other side Berhar-

115
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,520
from where I come is going to work out very fast.

116
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,400
Things are moving very fast there.

117
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,200
I was amazed so many people have told me that

118
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,120
in Amravati so many are Sahaja Yogis and in Akola, so many are there.

119
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,760
I was surprised, I have never been there.

120
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,520
So that is how it is spreading in Maharashtra.

121
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,200
So your song of Maharashtra Desha is working out. It’s not failing.

122
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,200
But I think Satara is the most difficult place.

123
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,080
Where we worked out yesterday I gave them left and right as to what they are.

124
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,880
It has helped them a lot,

125
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,200
because those who came to opposes at down and got their Realisation.

126
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,120
So they are misleading people

127
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,920
to start some sort of a new culture, like you started hippism.

128
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,920
And they are collecting young people,

129
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,880
that young people are leaving their schools.

130
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,040
Some parents come and complained to me about it.

131
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,120
They are not paying attention to their studies,

132
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,960
they are failing in their classes

133
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:53,000
and these people are stupidly using them.

134
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,680
I asked some of the boys "what is your policy?"

135
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,520
He said "We have no policy".

136
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,800
"Then what is your aim?".

137
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,920
"We have no aim".

138
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,440
"Then why are you doing this nonsense?"

139
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,240
They said because whatever the elders tell us, we do it."

140
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,800
I said: "Have you no personality? Nothing?"

141
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:21,280
It’s exactly what happened when this hippy movement started.

142
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,560
Some so-called intellectuals started this horrible hippy movement in the West

143
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,880
and when they found they cannot do anything about it,

144
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,360
they found it’s going to fail.

145
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,920
So many children lost their education.

146
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:47,240
So many children I know became pregnant girls and boys started squatting.

147
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:55,560
All that took them to the extreme that they became violent.

148
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,880
But unless and until there is a change within yourself,

149
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,120
how can you change anything outside?

150
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,200
You cannot.

151
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,480
And the first 7 people I fought, were all hippies; very difficult.

152
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:18,200
They called themselves hippies but they used to honk like a pig.

153
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,000
They wanted all the comforts, everything free,

154
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,720
extremely dominating and quarrelsome people.

155
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:30,120
But the foundation was laid on them.

156
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,800
Very surprising.

157
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:39,040
But I had to work on them for at least 4 years regularly.

158
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,520
So that is how Sahaja Yoga started

159
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,400
and today you know how much it has spread, how far it has gone.

160
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:15,360
Only in Maharashtra this problem is there of so-called intellectuals,

161
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,040
they call themselves, but they have no intelligence.

162
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,200
I talked to one man. I got fed up.

163
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,440
He didn't know anything about spirituality,

164
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,800
he didn't know anything about medicine, he didn't know anything about science.

165
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,400
I said “Now what do you know?”

166
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,280
It was impossible.

167
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,920
So such people who are jobless, we call them ‘recanting', they have no work.

168
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,960
They are starting all such things and we should not be upset with them.

169
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,360
They are trying to create problems

170
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,960
and they are getting money from some sources.

171
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,320
They are afraid. I think the politicians are afraid,

172
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:02,120
perhaps that Sahaja Yoga may turn their tables down,

173
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,000
because we believe in honesty

174
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,520
and maybe a day may come when these honest people might harm them,

175
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,320
perhaps. I do not know why.

176
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,440
This may be one of the reasons these people are frightened of us.

177
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:29,000
Whatever it is we have to understand that for doing any great work,

178
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,240
one has to sacrifice.

179
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,280
Of course you are not going to be crucified like Christ, no.

180
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,760
Nor do you have to sacrifice as my parents

181
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,640
sacrificed for the independence of this country.

182
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,200
Nor are you going to be tortured.

183
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,680
But little inconveniences you may have.

184
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,600
But I must thank you very much because of your coming here

185
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,080
and singing Marathi songs. They are quite impressed

186
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,120
and they think it's only possible because you are all Sahaja Yogis

187
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,840
otherwise you could not have done it.

188
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:11,800
So if there are any inconveniences, think that it is a joke, that's all.

189
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:20,960
Today I was thinking we should do the Puja of Shri Chakra and Lalita Chakra

190
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,160
which we have never done.

191
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,960
This is the right place to do these two chakras today.

192
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,080
A lot has been written about Shri Chakra, and about Lalita Chakra,

193
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:48,600
but to understand fundamentally, the left side when it reaches up to Vishuddhi,

194
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:56,240
then it uses on the right side the Shri Chakra,

195
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,560
on the left side the Lalita Chakra, to manifest itself.

196
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:14,120
These two chakras are the ones who manifest all that you see.

197
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:24,480
But these chakras are the ones who emit vibrations of different kinds

198
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:35,200
and because of their angularities, like if you have some sort of a cardboard

199
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,240
attached with small-small holes of different colours

200
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,120
which rotates all the time,

201
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,240
you get different colours, also you can get

202
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,400
different permutations and combinations.

203
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,240
In the same way different permutations and combinations are created,

204
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,680
and that is how you get all the advantages of Sahaja Yoga.

205
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,480
So these two chakras are very important.

206
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,760
I do not know if you know of any mantras about Shri Chakra

207
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,720
but I'll give you a book. Later on I'll translate it to you

208
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,520
and you can compose something for Shri Chakra.

209
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,880
Shri Chakra on the right side, Lalita Chakra on the left side.

210
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,640
So what we are really worshipping today is

211
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,680
Maha Saraswati Power and Maha Kali Power both put together.

212
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,680
So now we've started combining things, not individually.

213
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,960
Now these two energies are very important.

214
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,920
Without the energy, without the power, nothing exists,

215
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:57,760
for example if this light had no power to give light or to burn it is useless.

216
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:08,440
In the same way without getting your realisation, you are useless,

217
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,920
because your power is not awakened.

218
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,920
At least not completely.

219
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:28,680
But these two powers, give us lots of benefits even without realisation.

220
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,240
Whatever you see in this world created,

221
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:39,200
is done by these two chakras of the Adi Shakti.

222
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,280
But here the power doesn't move, it's not moving.

223
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:57,040
But in the human being the power starts moving, and when it starts moving

224
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:06,120
then we can say it is creating another world.

225
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,240
But movement is not the only thing.

226
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,920
This power acts, gives you intelligence, gives you all kinds of things

227
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,440
which you have as human beings.

228
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:27,720
But later on, this power itself becomes enlightened within you.

229
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,720
In the left and right side both become enlightened.

230
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,800
This enlightenment, you get it when you get yourself realisation,

231
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,120
but not immediately, not immediately, this one should understand.

232
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:54,320
For example, if you have pain, or if your chakra is catching,

233
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,880
you have to use your hands.

234
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,720
You cannot say that, 'the energy is flowing within me,

235
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,880
it's alright, I can manage', it's not like that.

236
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,520
You have to use your hands to impart that power to yourself or to others.

237
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,760
If you have pain in the stomach, then you can say that if there's energy

238
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,960
in my stomach why should I have pain in the stomach?

239
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,040
But the play of these chakras have to come,

240
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:40,240
and that is why you have to use your power of your hands.

241
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:50,080
If you cannot use your hands, then you cannot impart this energy.

242
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,520
Many people have asked me,

243
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,560
that Mother, when will it move horizontal?

244
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:05,000
It will move horizontal no doubt, it does,

245
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,080
but even that horizontal movement

246
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:14,320
is to be guided by these two very important chakras.

247
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:20,520
So you must understand the importance of these two chakras within yourself.

248
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,040
That's why I have told many a times, don't move your head too many times,

249
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,320
and this way many people talk, this style of talking, "no, this, that,"

250
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,920
very common with French especially.

251
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,640
That's another way you are not respecting your chakras,

252
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,320
shouldn't move your shoulders too much.

253
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:51,000
Mostly they talk like this, it's anti-chakras, anti-chakras.

254
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,680
Should keep your shoulders straight.

255
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,000
When you are singing you can move your whole upper part,

256
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,200
is all right, but not your shoulders.

257
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,720
This is the thing, one has to understand,

258
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,040
that these two centres are to be looked after.

259
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,920
You can move your neck, your body when you are singing,

260
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,680
is important, that helps,

261
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,080
but not your shoulders.

262
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,400
Shoulders are to be kept intact,

263
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,560
but while saying just yes, you need not go on "yes, yes, yes, yes."

264
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,240
Is very very simple thing, but it can have a very bad effect,

265
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:46,000
and those who move their shoulders too much do not feel vibrations much

266
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,080
because the chakras are not alright.

267
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,120
It's a very simple thing to be understood

268
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,840
that they are the most important chakras we have

269
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,720
and whatever is to be used out of this Paramachaitanya,

270
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:12,040
they have to be used by these two centres.

271
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,800
Even supposing your some chakra is catching on your spinal cord,

272
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,240
you have to use your hands.

273
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,040
Somebody can say, "I can just put my attention."

274
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,160
Doesn't work out, that good.

275
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,920
Because yet your attention has not that,

276
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,800
reached that stage where these chakras,

277
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:42,160
like Lalita Chakra and Shri Chakra obey your attention, they do not.

278
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,800
So you have to work out with your hands, be careful,

279
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,920
don't move your shoulders too much.

280
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,480
And, if you see now Indians when they sing bhajans, they move the whole body.

281
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,480
They'll do like this, but never their shoulders.

282
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,080
The shoulders will move in the same way as the neck is moving.

283
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,960
They might move their neck also.

284
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,680
But they'll never move their shoulder like this,

285
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:17,360
and it's regarded as inauspicious according to Indian standards.

286
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Because of this culture, based on what the saints have told,

287
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,280
and also about many seers have told,

288
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,440
it is more related to spiritual life than to materialistic life.

289
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,520
Now the materialistic life,

290
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,240
unless and until there is the foundation of the spiritual life,

291
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:47,600
takes you to a very partial development, we can say.

292
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:58,360
But to get a full development, you must have your foundation on spirituality.

293
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:03,440
That's why spirituality being the foundation has to be deep,

294
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:09,840
has to be fully equipped, has to be absolutely perfect.

295
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,240
Then the whole building can be built.

296
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:19,800
It's gone wrong in the West, doesn't matter, now you can build it up,

297
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:25,960
and then, you'll be surprised how you become really solid people.

298
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:33,000
This is a very short talk about Shri Chakra.

299
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,000
I think I should sit down and write all about it,

300
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,440
and it will be nice handy thing for you to read.

301
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:48,400
But you must know, that, beyond thought when you go,

302
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,440
these chakras become extremely efficient,

303
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:00,320
because the thought puts a pressure on them,

304
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,960
and because of the pressure the movement of these chakras

305
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,080
is very slow and ineffective.

306
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,160
But once you can get out of your thoughts and go into thoughtless awareness,

307
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,760
then these chakras start working it out

308
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,800
and you start moving much deeper into your own being.
