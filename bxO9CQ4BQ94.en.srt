1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,160
To all the seekers of truth, I bow.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,520
We have to be the true seekers of truth,

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,680
which is a rare quality people think,

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,040
but I have found out that in this world

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,000
there are many

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,840
seekers who are honestly and earnestly seeking.

7
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,200
They are seeking the truth.

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,040
They are trying to find out

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,040
what is within them,

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,960
they are trying to find out what is being prophesied about them.

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,520
It has been prophesied that the day of judgment will come.

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,120
This is the day of judgment,

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,760
when you are going to be judged.

14
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,840
You are not going to be put into any scales

15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,680
or there is no other measure by which you are going to be judged

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,120
but by knowing

17
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,080
how far truthful you are about your seeking

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,160
and how far you can gain something about it.

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,560
Today I had a chance

20
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,320
to be with some media people

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,480
and yesterday also.

22
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,480
I feel some of them just want to bring some controversy

23
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,000
to make it more interesting perhaps.

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,840
Whatever it is -

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,560
as a Mother I have to tell you that I have to take nothing from you.

26
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,360
I have come here to give you.

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,160
If you are identified with any organization

28
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,920
or you think you can fight for an organization

29
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,040
it would be very much better that you should not disturb us,

30
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,240
who are the people who are real seekers sitting down here.

31
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,160
It would be very civil of you to be

32
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,200
away from us, because we are not identified with any organization,

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,480
but with our own Self.

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,200
We have no organization you know in Sahaja Yoga.

35
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,120
And every type of a person is allowed to come in Sahaja Yoga,

36
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:29,080
so that he gets the full advantage of his destiny.

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,360
In My own

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,320
experiences I have found out

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,280
that people in the West are rather difficult

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,760
to get realization to begin with.

41
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,360
In India there can be six thousand people

42
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,320
and just in a split of a second

43
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,480
their Kundalini rises and they get their realization.

44
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,080
It’s a fact. But even when they get realization

45
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,800
they are not so seriously adhering to it

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,320
and they don't try to learn about the technique

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,760
of the laws of God's Love.

48
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,320
But in the West on the contrary,

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,640
though the first motion is very slow,

50
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,200
some people get it and lose it,

51
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,240
but they are very great seekers.

52
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,360
They get completely transformed.

53
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,880
I have seen people who have been drunkards, alcoholics,

54
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,200
who have been taking drugs and who have been homosexuals,

55
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,280
who led a very wretched life,

56
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,280
did all kinds of nonsensical things to ruin themselves.

57
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,960
Once they get realization they really become so

58
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,640
aware of themselves their self esteem rises

59
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,600
and they take to Sahaja Yoga

60
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,320
in a very proper auspicious way.

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,120
It's something surprising

62
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,600
that those who can get realization very fast

63
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,200
are not so good for giving realization to others.

64
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,840
They do not seem to understand

65
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,000
that it has to be given to other people.

66
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,040
While those who take more time,

67
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,480
those who have suffered so much,

68
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,680
those who have had a miserable life before,

69
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,720
those people who could be condemned as

70
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,720
the worst people on this earth

71
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,120
become so beautiful, not only that

72
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,200
but they take it upon themselves that this great

73
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,800
joy of God's Love must be given to others.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,120
But of course, despite all that, we do have some

75
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,480
funny people in every proof sometimes who are

76
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,200
like dog in the manger,

77
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,240
they don't get their realization nor do they allow others to get it.

78
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,360
It's a - some feeling with very frivolous and flippant people,

79
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,520
who are harmed very badly,

80
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,800
still they don't want to have the blessings of God

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,600
and try to create problems for us.

82
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,280
It is a sad thing that it should happen

83
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,280
in a country where there are so many seekers who are already lost.

84
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,160
So many people who are God's own people are lost.

85
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,240
One must have some civil sense in understanding

86
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,200
that those who are lost are the people of God.

87
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,320
As William Blake has said

88
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,040
that the men of God will become prophets,

89
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,280
and those who will become prophets will make other prophets.

90
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,760
This is the first thing that happens to you

91
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,480
that you become a prophet.

92
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,120
In the sense that you become a saint,

93
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,080
in the sense that the energy of God which is all pervading

94
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,120
which is doing all living work starts flowing through you.

95
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,960
And when it starts flowing through you, you can use that power,

96
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,720
not only to correct yourself and improve yourself

97
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,880
but give this, the blessing of peace and bliss to God.

98
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,920
Please be seated properly,

99
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,480
if you can't sit you sit on the chair all right?

100
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,480
Now,

101
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,720
for us it is important to understand that I am here

102
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:22,320
talking about something that is extremely holy and auspicious.

103
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,840
It has not worked out before.

104
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,280
This is the first time in the history of spirituality,

105
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,920
so many people are taking their realization.

106
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,560
As I said, this is the time of last judgment.

107
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,120
This is the time of resurrection which Mohammed Sahib has described

108
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:46,640
that at that time your hands will be speaking.

109
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,480
How can hands speak?

110
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,720
Anybody can say that, "How can hands speak?"

111
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,880
But the Muslims don't think about it.

112
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,360
They just say, “Let us do namas all the time morning till evening,

113
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,240
do the exercise of namas and we will get realization.”

114
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,280
Christians think that they will get their

115
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,360
realization if they take their baptism.

116
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,160
It's not so.

117
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,320
All these religions were established much before

118
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,960
just to keep you in balance.

119
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,120
To live a life of moderation.

120
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,160
On the contrary human beings have gone to the extremes.

121
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,040
But I must tell you that the Divine is so generous,

122
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,720
is so kind, is working so fast

123
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,880
that despite all these things that you have done to yourself

124
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,800
and to your society,

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,440
and as human beings the way you have erred

126
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,720
or whatever you have done, it just forgets and forgives.

127
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,880
Because you are the children of God.

128
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,360
Because He is your Father.

129
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:54,120
He is the Father who is love,

130
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,760
who is truth, who is joy.

131
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,440
And He is anxious that His children should enter into His kingdom

132
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,800
and enjoy all the blissful thing that He has to give.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,800
Now if you want to see

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,360
how you are made, you'll be surprised.

135
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,560
We must have self esteem.

136
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,880
We must understand that God has created us with very great care,

137
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,000
with very great love to become human beings.

138
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,720
And we should not for anything whatsoever,

139
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,680
whosoever it may be, the guru

140
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,520
or the cult or the religion or anything,

141
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,360
should neglect ourselves.

142
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,040
Then you will be responsible for your own neglect

143
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,680
and not God Almighty or any one of these prophets;

144
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,920
they have said that you can be saved.

145
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,800
Now as you see within us lies these subtle centers.

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,640
These subtle centers are

147
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,400
the ones which, who represent within us

148
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,160
a different stage of evolution.

149
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,840
First of all if you see the first center, is the Mooladhara.

150
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,960
Now this center is very important

151
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,800
because - for Australians I should say -

152
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,560
because in the universe this center is Australia.

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,520
Australia is the place

154
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,440
where this center we can consider as manifesting,

155
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,040
the powers of Mooladhara chakra.

156
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,560
It is the most powerful center in the whole being.

157
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,920
Because it is the power

158
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,760
of innocence in a human being.

159
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,480
The innocence that is the matter, matter is innocent,

160
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,440
animals are innocent,

161
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,800
because they haven’t developed their ego so far,

162
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,320
neither they have got those conditionings

163
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,280
by which we are supposed to be sinners.

164
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,560
A dog or a horse or a camel,

165
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,000
none of them think that they are sinners.

166
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,560
It's only we think that we are sinners

167
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,840
and we have done something wrong.

168
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,360
The reason for this is that God has given us freedom.

169
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,480
So whatever we have done in that freedom

170
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,440
we feel responsible for it

171
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,400
and we start condemning ourselves as sinners and all those things.

172
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,000
But who feels that he is a sinner is the ego and not the Spirit.

173
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,520
The Spirit does not commit any sin!

174
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,560
Is the purest of pure,

175
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,440
nothing can contaminate it,

176
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,160
nothing can destroy it,

177
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,000
nothing can make it absolutely invisible.

178
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,920
It is all the time there within our heart,

179
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,680
watching what we are doing.

180
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,760
As described in Gita is called as Kshetrajna,

181
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,040
the one who knows the field, who watches the field,

182
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,520
who is the witness of the field, which resides in our heart.

183
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,160
All these things whatever I've said has to happen to us,

184
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,040
otherwise it just becomes our mental activity.

185
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,320
I have nothing to bring in anything that is controversial,

186
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,760
everybody has brought out some sort of a thing

187
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,160
and said that this is this and this is this.

188
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,280
But one must know that once you get

189
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,640
your Self-realization it must work.

190
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,880
That's the point people do not understand,

191
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,920
that if you go to a guru,

192
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,800
did it work out your own powers?

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,880
Maybe they might be paying you for doing some work,

194
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,160
doesn't matter, that's another enterprise.

195
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,480
But did it give you the reality?

196
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,320
Did it give your absolute meaning?

197
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,640
It has given you your purpose or not?

198
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,320
Has it finished your seeking or not?

199
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,520
You must ask these questions to yourself and be truthful about it.

200
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,080
If not then you better get it.

201
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,840
Now to say that I am the only person doing this,

202
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,360
is all comes out of these people asking funny questions to you.

203
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,680
Now the thing is, she asked me a question:

204
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,480
“Are you the only person doing it?”

205
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,200
I said, I don't know of any other.

206
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,000
I mean you can twist it the way you like,

207
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,560
but so far I haven't met anyone who is giving mass-realization.

208
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,720
I have not met anyone and if I meet I will be very happy to retire.

209
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,840
Even if the sahaja yogis

210
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,320
who come up to that level can give mass-realization just like that

211
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,200
it would be a nice idea to retire

212
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,280
because now I am going to be 60 years of age

213
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,960
and I think I deserve retirement after the hard work of 14 years.

214
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,400
This one is the first center as I told you,

215
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,520
is this great country of

216
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,040
Ganesha - Australia.

217
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,200
The symbol of this is already expressed

218
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,160
in the place called as Ayers Rock.

219
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,160
Ayers Rock if you go and see

220
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,560
has the symbol which is embodying

221
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,920
the great deity that resides on this.

222
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,720
That has the same colour if you see there

223
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,320
and it has the same deity sitting down there

224
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,440
which is called as Shri Ganesha in the Sanskrit language.

225
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,280
Now this deity, innocent deity

226
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,400
or the one which is representing innocence,

227
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,720
incarnated on this earth

228
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,440
for our sake, for our salvation

229
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,920
as our Lord Jesus Christ.

230
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,000
He incarnated and He is bestowed upon

231
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,280
that center of Agnya which you see there

232
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,320
which is actually the body is made of the sun.

233
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,960
That's why most of the Christians are sun worshippers.

234
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,480
This great personality came on this earth

235
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,800
with a very great work because all others

236
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,120
also you can see, but today I would like to speak about Him.

237
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,720
I was told in Adelaide there are lots of churches.

238
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,640
But every human being is a church of God

239
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,480
and temple of God, in that resides Christ,

240
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,120
at this point which is the gate you can see very clearly,

241
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,160
in that gate He resides

242
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,760
and that is the cross which He has carried,

243
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,640
on which He was crucified,

244
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,320
because this cross was too tight,

245
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,640
and something had to pass through it.

246
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,920
His resurrection is the message to all the Christians

247
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,880
that the way He resurrected

248
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,560
you are going to be resurrected by God Almighty.

249
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,280
He came on this earth,

250
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,160
suffered for you and He died on the cross,

251
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,560
just to give you this special privilege of having this great

252
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,880
Agnya Chakra there which He adores.

253
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,120
This is the Agnya Chakra within us.

254
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,760
Now the mistake lies in one thing

255
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,960
that when we say of baptism, it is not an artificial process.

256
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,720
This is a living process.

257
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:54,120
Christ could not have talked of something artificial or ritualistic.

258
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,480
What He said, baptism was that the Kundalini should be awakened

259
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,440
and it should penetrate through this fontanel bone area,

260
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:09,320
and should give you the experience of the Holy Ghost.

261
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,120
Now this what I am saying

262
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,920
is also written in an Indian book about our Lord Jesus Christ,

263
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,160
and we do not read the right books in Sanskrit

264
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,880
because they are not translated.

265
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,440
What we are reading are the so called pseudo people

266
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,040
who came about from 50 years back and try to preach

267
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,400
about Hinduism or some sort of a "ism".

268
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,200
But about Christ nobody told.

269
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,320
When they came from other countries to visit India,

270
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,640
nobody told that He is the Maha Vishnu

271
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,840
because nobody knew about it. They could not relate it.

272
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,800
They could not relate, they could not tell

273
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,080
that He was the incarnation of the Maha Vishnu.

274
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,120
And Maha Vishnu is the one, if you read in the Devi Mahatmayam

275
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,320
everything tallies exactly with a character of Shri Jesus Christ.

276
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,880
If you read it you will be amazed how clearly He is described.

277
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,080
Even it is described that first He was an egg

278
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:17,960
and out of the egg, half egg was Shri Ganesha

279
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,200
and the half egg became Shri Jesus Christ.

280
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,480
And then, that's why on a Easter day if you know,

281
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,840
we always give eggs, meaning

282
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,160
we human beings are eggs at this time

283
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,600
as human beings, but we have to become the bird.

284
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:42,840
He came on this earth specially for creating a very special

285
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,640
type of device and an awareness within us.

286
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,120
Because this is the gate as I told you

287
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,600
to the Kingdom of God which is the limbic area within us.

288
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,720
Whatever is in the subtle is in the gross.

289
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,760
So this limbic area was

290
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,600
to be achieved through piercing through one gate that is

291
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,520
our Lord Jesus Christ.

292
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,440
Now how to pierce it was a problem because

293
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,120
if anybody tried to pierce it, he may just

294
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,040
go on the sides and become something else but a superconcious man.

295
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,840
So it was Jesus Christ who is the embodiment of

296
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,040
the Ruh, the All Pervading Power, the Chaitanya, the Omkara,

297
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,000
He came on this earth and He did that job for us,

298
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,960
because He resides there.

299
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,360
Now what He said by

300
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,960
the second birth or by baptism was

301
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,200
that this Kundalini which is lying

302
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,600
at the triangular bone there, has to rise.

303
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,040
Rise and penetrate through this center,

304
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,000
awaken Jesus Christ there.

305
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,600
Now the - what great miraculous thing

306
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,560
He has done that once you awaken this center within us,

307
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,200
these two institutions on the left and the right,

308
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,480
one is the ego, another is the super ego;

309
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,040
one is the ego which gives us

310
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,720
all ideas about ourselves which are not really self esteem

311
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,520
but something false.

312
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,680
And super ego is the

313
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:28,800
condition in which we human beings become conditioned,

314
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,120
in which we accept conditions: I am this, I am this, I am this.

315
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,760
Both the things are sucked in by the awakening

316
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,360
of the Kundalini of this great incarnation on this earth.

317
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,960
Once it is sucked in what you find that

318
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,560
on top of your head where you reach

319
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,040
this place, you find that it has become an open space now.

320
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,960
And suddenly you find the Kundalini is rising

321
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,960
and you can feel the breeze of the Holy Ghost.

322
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,800
In the bible about Holy Ghost very little is written,

323
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,800
for that you have go to Indian Scriptures were She is described

324
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,600
as the power of God Almighty, as Adi Shakti.

325
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,600
It is not proper to bind yourself like a horse

326
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,320
and see whatever is available but open yourself out

327
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,320
and see the references that are given about the great happening

328
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,520
of the advent of Shri Jesus Christ.

329
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Now what relations He has with Shri Krishna, with Shri Rama

330
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,720
with other deities and other prophets

331
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,840
is to be seen later on. When you come to Sahaja Yoga

332
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,080
gradually you realize that they are all related to each other.

333
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,880
And Christ has openly

334
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,600
said that those who are not against are with Me.

335
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,840
The three people who went to

336
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,560
see Jesus when He was born were Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

337
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,640
Is described, were the three great people

338
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,080
who went to see Jesus He was born was

339
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:06,080
Shri Krishna as Vishnu

340
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,920
and Mahesha is Shiva,

341
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,320
and Brahma as Brahmadeva.

342
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,920
All these people went to worship.

343
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,920
Nobody knew from where they came,

344
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,120
who they were, they were called as the three wise men.

345
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,360
Now whatever I am saying has to be first experienced,

346
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,360
because if I say something need not be true;

347
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,160
as I would say that it is not essential

348
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,520
that you should believeevery word I say.

349
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,880
On the contrary blind faith is against Sahaja Yoga.

350
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,760
It should happen to you first,

351
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,000
once it happens then you will be amazed

352
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,720
that you yourself is a very great

353
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,080
miraculous instrument of God.

354
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,760
You will be amazed, how this instrument works.

355
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,560
Even the people who come to Me, say,

356
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,320
“Mother we are gone cases we are good for nothing,

357
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,200
we led a very bad life we are inauspicious.”

358
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,960
Every sort of thing, I said, "Now

359
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,640
let it be, you don't judge yourself.

360
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,920
Let the Divine judge you, let's see what happens to you.

361
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,760
Why are you after yourself?

362
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,120
Forget it, first of all you did mistakes,

363
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,240
doesn't matter, but now you are using that again to harm yourself.

364
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,160
So please forget all the mistakes, everything that has been done,

365
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,760
all wrong things you think you have done.

366
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,040
Only you get what you have."

367
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,240
I am here just to give that what you have.

368
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,040
Now this great happening takes place

369
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,320
in such a smooth way in people who are normal people.

370
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,720
But not in all people I would say.

371
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,200
Some people do not feel it because they have some abnormalities

372
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,280
in their different centers which are placed within you.

373
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,960
These are the subtle centers expressed outside as gross centers.

374
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,720
They are all the time there,

375
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,120
but the deities within them are not yet enlightened.

376
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,400
They only get enlightened when the Kundalini rises

377
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,880
and pierces through the fontanel bone area.

378
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,040
Now the Spirit resides in the heart.

379
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,960
The Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty,

380
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,920
and Holy Ghost is the Power of God,

381
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,480
the Shakti of God which manifest everything else.

382
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,640
You'll be amazed how in the gross these things can be seen,

383
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,160
absolutely into the grossest thing.

384
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,240
My son in law is a great photographer

385
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,480
and he was working on Himalaya, ultimately I said you take it

386
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,120
from some old books and find out about it.

387
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,360
So I gave him an idea that you go and see near Manasarovar.

388
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,200
There is a place called Manasarovar

389
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,320
where also you find the Sadashiva is kept,

390
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,720
just like a human face.

391
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,280
Twelve miles of area you can see that it's just a human being,

392
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,400
a face of a human being which is called as Dakshinamurthy,

393
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,320
which is looking towards the south.

394
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,920
And this one is just a - not melted at all,

395
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,480
nothing, is all the time there

396
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,480
and if you see the face there are two other

397
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,840
aspects of Him are shown on His head.

398
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,760
But I told him that in Manasarovar

399
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,520
if you go that is the super ego, Manasa.

400
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,240
Manasa means the emotional mind, you see,

401
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,680
English language is rather funny

402
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,040
but I tell you Manasa means the emotional mind.

403
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,560
There is this emotional mind represented as Manasarovar.

404
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,480
And after that I told him there must be another one.

405
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,640
He said yes there is another one which is called as Rakshastal.

406
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,600
Rakshasa you know, the word Rakshasa means a devil - Rakshastal.

407
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,200
And now that Rakshastal is so turbulent

408
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,280
despite the fact they are close to each other

409
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,880
and between them is placed this Sadhashiva's image,

410
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,280
but this Rakshastal is so turbulent

411
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,440
that one can't believe that the same,

412
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,680
at the same place these two are having a different type of nature.

413
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,960
And those people who went with him could not even touch that

414
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,040
water of that Rakshastal, because it represented the ego,

415
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,400
less they become ego oriented, so they would not touch it.

416
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,440
So this was nothing, you see there are so many things in the gross

417
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,720
you can make it out whatever is described in the old times

418
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,720
is there existing, it is there.

419
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,960
In the same way human beings are in the intermediate state

420
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,760
and if you go even subtler

421
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,120
you'll find all these centers are within you.

422
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,240
Now how can you prove through Kundalini

423
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,960
that what I am saying is true?

424
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,360
That we have to see for oneself because in the West

425
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,120
I have to go on convincing people, convincing people,

426
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,880
pleading them for their realization.

427
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,200
Just for getting realization I have to put all, put forward

428
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,960
all kinds of explanations, all kinds of suggestions

429
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,960
that they should believe that they can get Self-realization.

430
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,800
There are people also who say, “How can you get it so easily?”

431
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,440
But if I say you can, why not try it, what's the harm?

432
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,360
It is so difficult to convince a

433
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,640
mind which is all the time thinking about it,

434
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,360
you can't think about it.

435
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,080
You can't think about a sprouting of the seed, it just works out,

436
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,840
if you put a seed in the mother earth it just works out.

437
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,680
You don't have to think,

438
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,720
if you start thinking about it, will it sprout? It will not.

439
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,120
It is the capacity of the mother earth that does the job.

440
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,120
But that time we take it for granted.

441
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,720
In the same way if I say you can get your Self-realization,

442
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,400
people start being doubtful about it.

443
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,440
Another thing is, that it is the other way round,

444
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,520
it is you who has to take something

445
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,280
not that I have to take anything from you.

446
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,960
You cannot give Me anything, it's you who has to benefit by it,

447
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,960
not Me. So why there should be a question

448
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,760
when I am not selling anything,

449
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,520
when I am not acquiring anything out of you,

450
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,360
when there is no possibility of you being exploited

451
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,800
or plundered by Me or used by Me.

452
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,680
Why should you get this doubt in your mind?

453
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,480
Is it also that you feel doubtful about yourself?

454
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,160
But that is to be decided by the Divine and not by you.

455
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:18,880
So please first of all try to know that you are the Spirit

456
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,920
and that you have to become the Spirit

457
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,040
and that once you become the Spirit

458
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,760
you become collectively conscious.

459
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,880
Today only when I went for this interview for the ABC,

460
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,880
the gentleman was -

461
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,680
of course interviewed Me, when I came out there was a lady.

462
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,720
And I told the lady that you have got liver trouble.

463
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,680
She asked Me, "How do you know, did he tell you?"

464
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,320
I said, "Nobody told Me, but I know because I know."

465
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,080
So that's what happens to you, that you become

466
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,240
collectively conscious, you can feel it on your hands

467
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,360
what's wrong with others and with yourself.

468
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:00,120
Now when we come to this

469
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,480
point of realization, we have to know

470
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,160
that the problems of this world are due to one fact,

471
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,880
that we have not achieved our absolute.

472
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,480
Some people think by doing alternate work we’ll be happier.

473
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,680
If supposing somebody is a capitalist he’ll become a communist.

474
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,880
Then if he is the communist, he’ll become a socialist.

475
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,120
These are all manufactures of this brain.

476
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,640
But actually if you ask, I'm a

477
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,440
complete capitalist because I have all the powers

478
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,440
and I am a complete communist

479
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,720
because I can’t live without giving it to you.

480
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:39,400
So how the communism and capitalism, which is so artificial outside,

481
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,880
becomes a reality with you, that you become empowered

482
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,400
with your real powers and not unreal powers

483
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,920
because possessions and things are unreal.

484
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,720
They are not real powers,

485
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,160
and once you get these real powers you want to share it with others.

486
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,880
You want to give it to others, you want to work it out for others.

487
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,280
And under these modern circumstances where we think

488
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,600
we are very frustrated and we are unhappy,

489
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,240
that's why we are going to God, is a wrong statement.

490
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,920
You are coming to God because you have been seekers

491
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,800
of ages.

492
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,120
You have been seeking long time back

493
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,360
and this is the time, the fruit of it is coming.

494
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,200
I've met so many children, even in Australia, who are born realized.

495
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,840
Great saints are taking their birth today

496
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,680
just to do this God's work

497
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,160
and you will find that you are one of them who has been seeking.

498
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,120
In Nala Damayanthi Puran, which was written

499
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,560
I think sixteen thousand years back,

500
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,120
it is mentioned that this Nala got very angry with Kali -

501
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,320
Kali is the one who governs this modern times -

502
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,040
and He said, "I am going to kill you,

503
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,560
because you create confusion in the minds of people,

504
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,760
you create complete confusion of values,

505
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,120
and you make them destroy themselves.

506
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,160
So I better destroy you once for all,

507
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,200
so there is no problem for human beings."

508
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
So Kali said, "All right you can destroy Me

509
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,120
but I have some good points,

510
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,880
you must know also the importance of My being there."

511
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,600
He said, "What is your importance?" He said, "The importance is

512
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:15,000
that when I will come on this earth to rule

513
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,720
that time, these people who are now

514
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,880
wondering in the Himalayas, wondering in the hills

515
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,040
and dales all over the world who are seeking

516
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,640
outside the cities, outside the houses

517
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,960
will find the answer.

518
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,600
They will find the God Almighty.

519
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,440
They will find their Spirit!”

520
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,760
He said it about sixteen thousand years back

521
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,000
and that is today has started.

522
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,480
The point where we have to

523
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,560
be really sure is, that this is the time.

524
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,320
Because the signs and symptoms are like that.

525
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,920
You can’t imagine so many people seeking

526
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,720
anywhere in the world,

527
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,240
anytime. When even Christ came

528
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,680
it was so difficult to carry those twelve people with Him.

529
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,520
Nobody was seeking at the time.

530
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,920
He of course gave sermons, He talked about it

531
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,640
that is the last, we can say,

532
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,920
who was such a great Incarnation on this earth,

533
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,600
but nobody listened to Him.

534
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,840
After that Mohammed came. When He lived how people treated Him!

535
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,600
They tried to poison Him, they tried to torture Him

536
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,760
and He had such a miserable life

537
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,760
that the Muslims today when they behave in the same manner,

538
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,120
it is most surprising that whatever He has suffered

539
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:34,520
the people have to support, suffer at the hands of these Muslims.

540
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,360
There are other also ideas people have got

541
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:41,040
like we must suffer for our emancipation;

542
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,600
or we must cleanse ourselves.

543
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,120
Already somebody has suffered for us.

544
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,760
There is no need for you to suffer and do all these things.

545
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,400
As I said that Jews believed in it and they denied Christ.

546
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,240
Then they suffered, really they suffered,

547
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,160
but after that suffering was there any transformation?

548
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,440
On the contrary they were so embittered

549
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,080
the way they behave while killing these PLO-people,

550
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,520
you will be amazed, the same people who suffered so badly

551
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,920
forgot all that and became such cruel people

552
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,720
and they killed so many people.

553
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,360
So this kind of a suffering doesn't bring

554
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,920
any kind of transformation within you.

555
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,720
Transformation has to take place,

556
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,240
this is the condition of your Self.

557
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,120
If the Self is manifesting,

558
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,840
it is not that you believe in this and I believe in that,

559
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,320
It IS! It's no question of believing, IT IS so!

560
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,680
That is what it is, nothing to be believed into blindly

561
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,600
or to be professed into or to accept something,

562
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,840
but it is there within you and that is an absolute truth.

563
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,520
Even if there are ten small children sitting

564
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,760
and they are realized souls

565
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,000
and if you ask them, "What is the condition of this gentleman?"

566
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,000
They will all raise one finger. This means only one thing,

567
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,960
because they can feel it, on their finger something burning,

568
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,240
maybe something numb, maybe something heavy.

569
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,160
All of them, even if you tie their eyes, will say the same thing

570
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,160
because truth is the same.

571
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,880
As all of us are sitting here we know it's night

572
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,240
and that the colour of this thing is greenish or whatever it is.

573
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,120
In the same way, when you get your realization, the feeling,

574
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,360
the awareness comes in your feeling and this feeling

575
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:33,520
tells you exactly where you are and what you have to do.

576
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,400
It is a remarkable thing that you are a human being.

577
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,400
Is the greatest work of God,

578
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,400
the greatest creation of God is human being.

579
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,280
Of course you may think they are ugly

580
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,080
and you should have nothing to do with them.

581
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,800
There are some people who just believe that

582
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,160
human beings are the ugliest thing. But they are not!

583
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,240
Only thing, they have not been put to the mains,

584
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,200
this is yoga, is the union with the Divine.

585
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,160
Unless and until an instrument is put to the mains,

586
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,920
to its source, it has no meaning.

587
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,920
In the same way unless and until

588
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,080
you are put to the mains, you will have no meanings.

589
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,240
So the best thing is for you to be convinced

590
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,240
that you have to have your realization

591
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,200
and it can work out in a split of a second and let it work out.

592
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,280
Just work it out is the best for you that anyone can

593
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,480
suggest that you become the Self.

594
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,840
Now about the Self I have talked many a times, I told people

595
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:41,760
that Self is the one that is residing in your heart.

596
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,600
But the seat of the Self is here, the Sadhashiva.

597
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:50,440
He stands here and when the Kundalini rises and touches that,

598
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,760
the seat sends message to the Heart

599
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:59,560
and then the Heart starts feeling throwing those vibrations.

600
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,480
Actually it is not the Spirit that does

601
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:08,640
but it is the Kundalini after enlightenment starts pulsating.

602
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,960
It’s so clear-cut, you can’t imagine,

603
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,520
it is so beautiful, you can’t imagine.

604
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,240
Now the result of this Self-realization -

605
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,600
in this short time I have to cover many points

606
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,600
and that's why I am trying to cover it up -

607
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,360
is first of all you get your physical

608
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,640
fitness. People ask Me, "How could You cure physically?"

609
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,720
If you are doctors here, you will understand

610
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,600
that doctors do not know anything about

611
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,520
parasympathetic nervous system.

612
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,560
That is the expression of the central path

613
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,920
within us called as the Sushumna Nadi.

614
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,600
This parasympathetic nervous system gives us the balance,

615
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,320
the sustenance.

616
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,280
For example, if you are running fast your heartbeat increases.

617
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,040
But it is slowed down

618
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,960
by the action of parasympathetic nervous system.

619
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,680
When the Kundalini is awakened this parasympathetic nervous system

620
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:06,160
becomes evident in our awareness.

621
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,440
First time the Spirit starts becoming

622
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,400
one with our attention.

623
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,960
Our attention itself becomes enlightened.

624
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,760
Now when this Kundalini rises,

625
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,000
this parasympathetic nervous system starts manifesting itself

626
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,280
and whatever center is exhausted

627
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,880
by which an imbalance is created within us

628
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,600
in our physical body or in our emotional body

629
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,960
or in our mental body or in our spiritual body,

630
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,080
it starts absolutely

631
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,280
behaving in a manner as if we have reached our total blessings.

632
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,160
It just disappears, it just disappears.

633
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,040
And it is so surprising, that people don't want to believe it

634
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,680
because they have seen a person behaving this manner and that manner

635
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,920
and suddenly next day overnight they find

636
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,160
the person who is an alcoholic becomes a free bird.

637
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,360
They find a drug addict becoming a free bird,

638
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,800
they can’t believe it. It is fantastic!

639
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,360
Everything that God does is fantastic.

640
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
All His work we have taken for granted,

641
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,080
at least this living work of God

642
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,520
you can understand that it works within you.

643
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,240
It is beyond all your dogmas,

644
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,440
all your philosophies, all your complications.

645
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,360
Because it is unlimited,

646
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,680
while your brain is limited, your intelligence is limited.

647
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,240
And if you want to understand God

648
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,960
you cannot understand It

649
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,520
by this limited thing, which is your brain.

650
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,280
Of course logically you can come to conclusion.

651
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,520
You have to come to conclusion logically understanding that

652
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,720
you cannot pay for it, you cannot work it out,

653
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,520
it has to be spontaneous

654
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,800
and you cannot do it yourself.

655
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,160
Everything you can do it yourself,

656
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,320
but realization has to be worked out

657
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,600
by somebody who is an enlightened person.

658
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,200
For example if I work it out for any one of you,

659
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,520
that person can work it out for others.

660
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,160
This is so simple as that and I think

661
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,760
it is high time that we should go in for realization,

662
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,720
we have so many people and I won't be able to attend to you,

663
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,640
if I continue with the speech.

664
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,120
Is it all right for you to have the realization now?

665
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,200
Just open any window here, either air condition or anything.

666
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,800
If you do not treat yourself with respect,

667
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,920
nobody can treat you with respect.

668
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:35,120
So be respectful about it and try to

669
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,800
get the blessings of realization,

670
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,280
that would be a nice idea.

671
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,960
By the way we have now been able to

672
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,920
get some people to work in Adelaide

673
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:54,240
for you to go further with your realization

674
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,960
and understanding what it is,

675
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,240
to learn the technique of it.

676
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,160
And once you learn the technique

677
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:07,040
you will find it will help you a lot to help others.

678
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:12,920
And if you are intelligent enough you can do it very well.

679
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,840
Will you please all put your hands towards Me

680
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,120
like this, just like that.

681
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,960
Those who don't want to do it

682
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,880
should please go away and leave us alone,

683
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,920
I would request you those who don't want to do

684
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,640
meditation should go away

685
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,680
and don't disturb others because it spoils the vibrations of people,

686
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,840
so those who don't want to do it please go away.

687
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,960
You don't want to do it?
Can I ask a question?

688
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,920
No, no, no question today, I have had enough

689
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,880
of questions this morning, will you please go.

690
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,720
No you can write, all right.

691
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,920
You can write to Me, you see the questions I had too many

692
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,640
and I want to attend to everyone.

693
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,080
You remember last time how much I had to work

694
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,840
and I couldn't attend to everyone.

695
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,080
So it's better not to attend to anybody's personal questions,

696
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,320
it's not proper because I want to give attention to you all.

697
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,560
You see, if you have any questions you may write to Me

698
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,720
and I'll let you know. Please put your hands towards Me.

699
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,120
All of you should do it. Those who do not want to do it, again I say

700
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,360
please be civil and kind

701
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:14,040
and go away as proper people, and don't try to disturb us.

702
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,760
Please put your hands towards Us.

703
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,600
You may write your questions

704
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,640
and come and see Me tomorrow morning, all right?

705
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,280
If you have any questions, I'll give you special time.

706
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,160
You have also questions? All right,

707
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,400
so can you go out now and write down.

708
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,880
Why not? You cannot force yourself to be here,

709
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,880
it is very wrong. You want to force.

710
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,960
Why?

711
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,520
No that's not I am not going to waste any time with you, but

712
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,280
is very unkind of you to force us like that.

713
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,960
We never come to your meetings, why should you come to our meeting

714
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,440
and disturb us? It's not proper.

715
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,160
It's all right, forget it now!

716
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,200
We have, I have nothing to talk, no no it's all right,

717
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,280
don't disturb us, please, please will you behave yourself, or ask him to get out.

718
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,920
"Why do you call yourself God?”

719
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:01,080
All right, forget it just now,

720
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,760
you are God is it? What good have you done to anyone

721
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,520
that you are here to object Me?

722
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,160
Have you done any good to anyone so far? Not even to yourself.

723
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,160
Then, why don’t you allow Me to do good to others?

724
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,040
All right. Now don't talk!

725
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,280
Keep your hands like this.

726
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,800
I could see the way he is,

727
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,960
I could see that, immediately I pointed out,

728
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,120
you see among all. All right keep yourself shut!

729
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,280
You only know how to talk, you have a big mouth,

730
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,440
that’s all, nothing more.

731
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:34,720
Please close your eyes.

732
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,680
Please close your eyes.

733
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,440
With both hands towards Me,

734
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,640
you just close your eyes and don't worry about others,

735
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,920
just think of yourself just now

736
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,280
that you have to have this experience.

737
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,160
So many people had experience in the last meeting

738
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,120
and you all should have it.

739
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,240
Even if you are thinking it does not matter.

740
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,720
Let loose your attention, don't put any pressure on your attention.

741
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,000
Just let loose your attention.

742
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,160
Now as I told you the left hand

743
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,160
is the power of your desire.

744
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,040
And the right side is the power of your action.

745
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,520
So with your left hand on your lap in a very relaxed manner

746
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:35,320
you raise your right hand to your heart, to your heart

747
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,240
and ask a question within yourself, not loudly,

748
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:52,840
'Mother am I the Spirit?'

749
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,920
Just put your hand right on your heart.

750
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,040
Left hand towards Me, left hand towards Me, just ask a question,

751
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:16,600
'Mother am I the Spirit?'

752
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,800
Now put this right hand on your stomach on the left hand side

753
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,120
which is the center of your

754
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:33,240
guru, the primordial master.

755
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,720
As you are the master of yourself,

756
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:42,000
you just say, 'Mother, I am the master.'

757
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,680
'Am I the master?' we asked the other day,

758
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,840
today you say, 'Mother, I am my own guru , I am my own master.’

759
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,880
With full confidence you should say.

760
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,760
You should understand it fully within yourself

761
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,200
that unless and until you become a master,

762
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,960
you cannot make out who is true, who is not true.

763
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:11,840
You cannot make it out! So first of all you become the master.

764
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:15,480
Put your right hand

765
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:22,920
on your stomach on the left hand side and ask a question,

766
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:26,320
if you have come today for the first time.

767
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:28,560
But those who've got realization

768
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,880
the other day must say, ’Mother, I am the master.

769
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,560
I am the guru.'

770
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:46,160
You don't need any guru because your Spirit is the guru.

771
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:51,280
Your Spirit is the guru! Just awaken your Spirit.

772
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,760
Now again raise your hand higher on the heart

773
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,680
and say,

774
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,840
'Mother, I am the Spirit.’  Just say that.

775
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,320
Now put this right hand

776
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,800
on the left side of your neck

777
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,120
which is another center of Vishuddhi.

778
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:05,200
You are yourself raising your own Kundalini.

779
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:10,480
At this center you have to say, 'Mother, I am not guilty.'

780
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,360
Say it again, not to feel guilty for anything

781
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,480
that you think you have done wrong.

782
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,800
Just say, 'Mother, I 'm not guilty.'

783
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,880
Because the instrument that you are

784
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,080
has to be cured by the Divine.

785
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:50,200
Because you have to do God's work. This is God's work!

786
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:54,680
Unless and until you feel

787
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,640
completely relieved of your guilt,

788
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:04,760
how can you work out God's things?

789
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,480
If you have said mantras or something in unauthorised way,

790
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,080
also you develop this trouble on the left side

791
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,880
which is a very dangerous thing to develop

792
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:32,320
and thus you develop a heart trouble

793
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,920
and can be at a very early age,

794
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,760
you might suffer from a heart trouble.

795
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:45,000
So better say, 'Mother, I'm not guilty.’ If you are the Spirit

796
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,640
then how can you be guilty?

797
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,720
There is another danger that lies while saying all these mantras

798
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,720
that one can develop diseases like cancer,

799
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,600
osteomalayetie and all these by saying wrong mantras,

800
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:05,800
guided by some wrong gurus.

801
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,160
So if you have done anything like that

802
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:12,720
you have to say, 'Mother, I'm not guilty.’

803
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:21,880
It can have very serious effects, very serious effects,

804
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,880
specially the muscular part can be absolutely

805
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,800
paralysed on the left side.

806
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:47,480
Now put your right hand across the forehead

807
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,560
and say,

808
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,160
'Mother, I forgive everyone.’

809
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,440
This you have to say with full heart and full understanding

810
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:03,320
because the other day, you remember

811
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,920
that when you said it, immediately you got your realization.

812
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:11,880
Before that it was all blocked up in the blockage.

813
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,800
You have to forgive, forgive others,

814
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,240
forgive others! If you have self esteem

815
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,360
then you will respect others also, otherwise you cannot have respect.

816
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,520
If you do not respect yourself, you cannot respect others.

817
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:28,800
The first thing is you must say, 'I forgive everyone.’

818
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,880
Not to get upset by what has happened

819
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:38,280
or what somebody does to you, but just to say, 'I forgive everyone.’

820
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,280
Some people say it is difficult to forgive

821
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,800
but I think it is a myth.

822
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,040
Because when you forgive what do you do? You just

823
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,320
are forgiving yourself

824
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,920
because you are not anymore suffering

825
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:00,960
from the embitterment from others.

826
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:05,840
Now put the same hand on top of your head.

827
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,960
First on top of your Sahasrara.

828
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,320
Now you have to see, it has to work, it has to work out,

829
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:25,040
it's not just talking, but it has to work out.

830
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,680
Now see for yourself,

831
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,160
raise your hand a little higher.

832
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,760
At this stage you have to ask for realization,

833
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,120
because I cannot cross your freedom.

834
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:41,600
So say, 'Mother, please give us realization" at this point.

835
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,560
just put your hand

836
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:49,440
parallel to your fontanel bone area.

837
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,880
Now put the other hand and see

838
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,600
if there is a cool breeze coming out.

839
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,400
Put your right hand towards Me,

840
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,480
just put your right hand towards Me,

841
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,960
whether you are sick or anything, you just work it out.

842
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,960
It's there, yes.

843
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,280
You have to convince yourself.

844
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,320
Nobody can convince you, it is you who has to convince yourself.

845
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:24,040
You have to feel it yourself.

846
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,360
If you are not feeling it, then there is something wrong with you.

847
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,600
Doesn't matter, we'll work it, it should, it should work out.

848
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,520
If you are not feeling it then is not correct.

849
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:37,360
Now you can also change again the hand and say that -

850
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:39,440
find for yourself,

851
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,640
and ask a question, 'Is this the

852
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,200
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?' Ask a question.

853
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,320
Now rapport is established, just see for yourself.

854
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,560
See now how you are feeling cooler with the same

855
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,600
thing, is because you have become yourself an air conditioner.

856
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,480
That's why you all are feeling cooler

857
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,000
otherwise you all are feeling so hot.

858
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:14,680
Where is that heat gone now? Just see the proof.

859
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,600
If there is too much heat that means you are either

860
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:25,560
a liver patient or some disease there which is to be attended.

861
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,640
See for yourself.

862
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,680
If you, even if you are paid by some guru,

863
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,480
better get your realization

864
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,600
because they can give you only money,

865
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,040
which you can't take with you. Better take your realization,

866
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,520
to be wise and sensible, be good children.

867
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:54,960
Take your realization! This is the chance of lives!

868
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,760
Now put your both the hands like that

869
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,680
and ask a question in your heart,'Is this the

870
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,760
breeze of the Holy Ghost we are feeling?'

871
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:24,920
You will start feeling the cool breeze in your hands,

872
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:29,560
the sensation crawling down your hands.

873
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,040
All right? Now put your hands towards Me.

874
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,400
I'll also teach you how to give realization.

875
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,640
I'll try to teach you how to give yourself a realization

876
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,920
which is a very simple method of maintaining your realization.

877
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,840
Apart from that

878
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,440
there are going to be some sahaja yogis here

879
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:55,040
who are going to help you to progress further.

880
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:02,680
This hand is to be placed in front of your

881
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,040
Kundalini like this, this is the

882
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,280
fixed hand, you can say the fixed movement,

883
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:11,320
and this right hand is to be taken round like this.

884
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,520
higher in front and down. Everything should be intelligible,

885
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,720
you should understand why we do it. You see clockwise method

886
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,520
is better to raise the Kundalini. Now do it,

887
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,280
it's not just to tell some

888
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,440
mantras to someone and you jump like a frog,

889
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:29,800
it's really, it should happen in a way that is happening.

890
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,560
Now put your hands like that. Now take it down.

891
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,960
Again we have to give a knot up there,

892
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,520
it's the raising of the Kundalini. Let's do again.

893
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,760
The truth is so abounding, that you deny it is dishonesty,

894
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,880
is dishonesty, complete dishonesty!

895
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:54,320
Now take it up, one more. Now weave it up.

896
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:06,040
Do it one more, now thrice you have to do it, one,

897
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,400
two,

898
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:13,640
three. Now see for yourself.

899
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,960
All right?

900
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,720
You feel very peaceful.

901
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,760
The other day I had a lady who came quite stunned,

902
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,480
she could not believe that she is so much changed

903
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,320
and she said, “I have become a free person now.”

904
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,480
All right? Good.

905
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:41,600
So thank you very much and if you have any other problem

906
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,720
of some disease or anything

907
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,440
you can come and see Me now.
