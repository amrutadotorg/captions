00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
Based on and inspired by the teachings
of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, this series

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.574
aims to explore the evolutionary relationship
between two interconnected domains

00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:07.844
expressing human awareness
at the gross and subtle levels.

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:11.115
It endeavors to elucidate this complex interplay
between the current scientific understanding

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.919
of human neuroanatomy; the autonomic
nervous system in particular,

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.923
and the so-called subtle system as described
in the traditional literature on yoga.

00:00:16.923 --> 00:00:19.961
Ultimately, the series tries to bring its viewers
along this exploratory journey

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:23.500
to experience these relationships through meditation
as taught by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.840
Thanks to all our viewers for
joining us in this series.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.280
We are on this exploration into
the fascinating intersection

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.360
of neuroscience and spirituality
with Dr. Ashish Pradhan,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.360
who is a distinguished leader in neurology
and cardiovascular medicine. Welcome, Dr. Ashish.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:10.800
Thank you, Monikaji.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.080
Great to be back again.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.120
Definitely.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.800
My pleasure.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.800
The question that
I always ask you

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.800
about every energy center
that we talk about,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.240
I know today we are focused
on the fifth energy center.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.840
So, what is the relationship between

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.360
the autonomic nervous system
and the fifth energy center?

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.920
And then what organs does
this center relate to in human anatomy?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.480
We also hear about the thyroid gland,
maybe a little bit about that.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.080
Let us begin as always.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.960
The fifth energy center, also
called the Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.440
has a critical
role to play in human evolution.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.400
Each of these centers do, we have been saying
from the very beginning, the whole system is integrated.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.800
It is not unitary.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.960
But this energy center is kind
of special in its own way.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:13.680
It has 16 aspects to it
according to the Sahaj teachings.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.600
So if we look at human
evolution from the time again,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.040
from when it started,
unicellular life forms

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.520
right up to the vertebrate
animals or mammals such as us,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.760
this energy center is believed
to have played two roles.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:48.240
One is that this energy center controls
the voice box or the larynx.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.720
It also controls the movement of our arms
and so on and so forth.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.960
But it is a speech that I would
like to focus on a little bit.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.800
So, as we’ve said
several times in this series,

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.280
we have the autonomic nervous system
within us—

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.520
which is what
this series is about.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.480
Two components:
sympathetic, parasympathetic.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.040
And the larynx or the voice
box is controlled by two nerves

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.880
called the recurrent laryngeal
nerves and they are offshoots.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.580
They come from the vagus nerve
and the vagus nerve comes from the midbrain.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.520
So the long and short of it
is this, that in evolution,

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.840  
one of the reasons according  
to evolutionary biologists,  

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.200  
one reason the Homo sapiens enjoys  
a pre-eminent position  

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.000
on this planet is its
ability to communicate.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.760
So communication is
one of the key functions

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.120
enabled by this energy center.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.880
And if you think about it,
it is the power of speech.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.760
Now, it is not that sounds that
are produced by an organism

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.280
are unique to the Homo sapiens.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.920
There are multiple other species,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.560
thousands and thousands
of them that produce sound.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.800
Birds produce sounds, animals produce sounds,
mammals such as whales and dolphins in the water,

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.480
they produce sounds.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.440
So producing sound by itself
is not the issue.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.960
In all these organisms, this energy center
probably played a role.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.360
But in the human being,
it is the most evolved

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.880
because it allows us to form
what we call speech patterns

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.040
that we call words and therefore language.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.240
And it is this language that has allowed,
or the ability to create languages,

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.560
to speak languages, to communicate
with each other in languages,

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.360
which unfortunately sometimes
also leads to divisions

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.480
amongst individuals
and communities and nations.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.760
But it is this power of language
that has enabled us

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.440
to gain dominance over other species.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.200
Now, how did that pan out?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.320
How did it provide us with
an evolutionary advantage?

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.800
So it is hypothesized and there is
maybe a full rational background

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.240
as to how this was probably possible,

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.520
as if we go back to
literally millions of years

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.480
and maybe hundreds of
thousands of years after that,

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.680
when humans started living in caves

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.840
with primitive tools,

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.880
they were subject
to attacks by wild animals.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.280
So let us say two individuals
living in the same cave

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.760
or near each other could warn each other

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.040
through a pattern of speech that there may be
a sabre-toothed tiger close by

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.560
and then banding together,
either running away from it

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.880
or making sure they
did not get close to it.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.920
That allowed for a survival advantage.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.000
And then we can expand on
this for the next,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.760
as much as we want, but we
can see how that ability

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.600
to communicate danger,
forewarning of a threat

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.840
to an individual or to a family
or to a group of individuals,

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.560
to a settlement allowed this to happen.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.360
So in human evolution, this center
has played a very important role.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.640
The other role that the founder
of this system of meditation,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.800
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi always says,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.840
is that it was this center that
allowed us to raise our heads.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.720
So this cervical curvature,
if you see the human skeleton

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.760
or the human vertebral column in profile,

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.840
you have the cervical curvature, then

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.760
the thoracic curvature
and the lumbar

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.440
and the sacral curvatures.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.560
So when in the Neanderthal stage
or in the Denisovan stage,

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:10.960
the other species that preceded the Homo sapiens,
if you see the classic biology textbook

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.360
showing the evolution of people,

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.040
somebody hunched over and then
gradually stood upright.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.840
This upright posture and
particularly the raising of the neck

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.520
is believed to have been
influenced by this energy center

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.040
through its control of the vertebral
column as well as the nerves,

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.360
both the sympathetic,
the parasympathetic

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.960
as well as the skeletal nerves
that allow for the musculature

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.360
to function in this fashion.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:51.360
Besides the vocal cords, this energy center
is responsible for the control of our teeth,

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.200
our musculature here, our face,
the muscles as well as our ears.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.680
So again, think about it.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.120
The sense of olfaction,
that is a sense of smell.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:13.040
So the sense of smell, the ability to hear
and the ability to speak are all functions

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.560
that are governed by
this single energy center.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:21.040
And if we go back into
our evolutionary process,

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.680
it is believed that
the sense of smell was the first

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.280
amongst all other senses that was evolved
or that was developed

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:40.560
because in the water the little fish had to detect
the presence of a predator by smelling

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:45.200
through the very primitive
olfactory cells that it had,

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.560
the presence of a larger animal or a larger being

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.000
because of the chemicals that it emitted
through its presence.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.720
So the sense of olfaction also gave us
that evolutionary advantage as it evolved.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.880
The sense of hearing, same thing.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.760
When we heard sounds, the sense of sound,
I think we discussed this in a previous episode,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:14.640
developed even before the cells that eventually
over millions of years became our eyes

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.320
or the sense of vision.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.680
So the sense of smell and the sense of hearing
allowed us that evolutionary advantage

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:26.480
as the human condition evolved but

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.760
even starting from literally
billions of years ago.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:35.440
So this energy center allowed us to evolve,

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.840
to gain what we might dare
use the word consciousness.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.320
Who we are as individuals, as a collective,

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.200
as a body started from this
particular energy center.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.840
And that is why this center
from a Sahaj point of view

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.960
is responsible for allowing us
to have a sense of collectivity

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.280
which we will deal with later in this episode.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.560
The thyroid gland, again very, very important,

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.200
it sits here in front of the
trachea in this upper part

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.760
and the thyroid gland
secretes hormones

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.960
that we are all familiar with,
that is thyroxine

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:26.400
and triiodothyronine, the thyroid T3, T4.
Most of us who have undergone exams, know

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.800
that your internist will ask for
the levels of those hormones.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.480
Those hormones are very important
because they are related

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.840
to neural development, the
development of the brain.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.440
So the thyroid hormones
help in what is called

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.640
neurogenesis which means
the growth of cells.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.240
They are important
for synaptogenesis which means

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.240
the connectivity between these
neurons is very important,

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.640
we will deal with this in the final episode.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.920
But these are synapses through
which neurons talk to each other.

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:09.040
The presence of these hormones is very important
for optimal development of the brain

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.160
and unfortunately we know that
individuals who from birth

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:18.080
or lack this hormone do suffer
from neurological conditions

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.800
and even sometimes mental retardation.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.520
So these hormones are important and that is why

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:27.120
this energy center, 
which is the fifth energy center,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:33.040
is so critical for human evolution,
for the development of the human brain,

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:38.560
the overall development of the nervous system,
and the sense of collectivity that we feel

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:43.920
both as an individual as
part of a larger organism.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.160
I know this answer is very long

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.720
but there's one interesting hypothesis

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:56.640
that has recently been postulated
is that this energy center

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:58.160
probably also controlled

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.000
the development of the entire skeleton,
not just the musculature.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.120
But also the bones-muscles
essentially sit on the bones,

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.480
the bones provide the framework,
the muscles sit on that.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.960
If you have seen images
or in museums or sketches

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:20.320
or what we know from skeletons
that have been discovered

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:27.040
of our ancestors from the distant past,
the lower jaw protrudes forward.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.760
So the front part of the face,
the upper part of the face

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.480
sits at the back,
the lower jaw juts forward.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:35.520
You see that in apes, in great apes.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.200
Whereas with the human being,
the jaw has gone back

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.880
and it is much more level and the
reason for that is hypothesized

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:50.560
to be that this muscle that controls
our mastication, the chewing

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.560
with the lower jaw that goes
up and down when we chew food

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.920
which is the lower bone which
is called as the mandible bone.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:06.480
The mandible bone was much more stronger
and protruded forward but through a gene

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.040
that controlled for its
development is thought

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.440
to have changed the structure of the bone

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.240
to the extent that it allowed for
the mandible to go back

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:25.360
and because of that the
biomechanical forces were reduced

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.260
or there was less stress on it
and that allowed

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.040
for the skull to grow.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.160
Now let's put it all together.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.720
The lower part of the face which is the mandible,
if it was longer it caused more stress here

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.920
and therefore it pulled
this down and did not allow

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.960
these two parts of the cranium,
the skull to expand

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.400
and therefore what was inside it, the brain.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:56.720
The brain couldn't expand but
because this went back,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.120
biomechanical forces reduced here,

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.080
and that reduced pressure
on the cranium bones here

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.720
on both sides,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:11.520
to allow for that space for this mass of cells
inside called the brain to expand.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:18.800
So it is absolutely fascinating to see,
and of course hypothesize, we cannot prove this,

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.400
there is no way to easily
prove this, but it is a fact

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.880
that had the mandible been not controlled

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.160
or had it not gone back, maybe the ability

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.320
of the cranium to grow and
therefore for the brain to expand

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:39.360
which makes this possible, you and I to speak,
would perhaps not have been possible.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:46.880
So this energy center is absolutely critical,
it's fascinating, it's extremely complex

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.560
but it has probably played a
stellar role in human evolution.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.360
Definitely.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.920
It's such a sophisticated
mechanism in this evolution.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.480
It's so interesting to learn about this.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.240
So Dr. Ashish, as we understand
that every center

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.520
has some qualities
that an individual manifests

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.280
and then is there
any potential scientific basis

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.400
to the Sahaj teaching that
collective consciousness

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:17.680
begins from this center?

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:23.120
Yes, it's a little complex mechanism 
or a complex explanation

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.520
but we'll try to simplify this.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:31.520
So along with the control of
the vocal box, of the larynx,

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.280
of the vocal cords within the larynx

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.040
and the other parts within the face,

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.320
this energy center is also believed
to control two other plexuses.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.920
One is the cervical plexus and 
the other one is the brachial plexus

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.560
and these are again as we
have discussed, plexuses are

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.640
groups of nerves,
they contain both sympathetic,

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.760
parasympathetic and sensory components.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.480
Now the brachial plexus controls
the movement of our arms.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.720
It makes the movement of our arms possible
that helps us to communicate.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:12.880
The interesting fact is that
so far as microdissection

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.800
techniques have allowed us to examine,

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:22.560
we do not have parasympathetic nerve endings
in the tips of our fingers.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.440
We only have sympathetic nerve endings

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:30.720
and although we believe that
parasympathetic controls

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.840
everything within the viscera,
we have discussed this before

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.000
through the vagus nerve
for the most part

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.520
but there are no sympathetic nerve
endings in the tips of our fingers.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.400
Now how is that important?

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.800
It's important from a Sahaj
point of view because when

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:54.480
the inner energy rises and it
crosses this energy center,

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.240
the fifth energy center
within the central channel,

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.600
through mechanisms that are
physiologically very difficult

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.120
to appreciate, not yet,
I mean human science

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.920
has not reached that stage
but probably one day will,

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:15.680
however it allows us
to feel reality

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:21.120
beyond the cognitive perception.

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.560
And that is we can feel what
are called as vibrations,

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:30.320
this cool breeze that does blow
through the tips of our fingers.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.280
Now let's put it all together.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000
The energy rises through the central channel
which is parasympathetic.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.640
It is not sympathetic,
it is parasympathetic.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.680
However the ability to feel
the rising of this energy

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.800
and the consequence
of that rising

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.600
is felt through
the tips of our fingers

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.920
which is sympathetic.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.520
And therefore it is at the
level of this energy center

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:05.280
because of these two plexuses,
the brachial plexus

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:08.480
and the cervical plexus but
predominantly the brachial plexus

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:14.480
which innervates our hands
and the nerves in our hands,

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:20.880
we can clearly see how this energy center

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.240
allows us to feel these vibrations.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.600
Because of Sahaj,

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.520
when this energy rises and
you can feel it,

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:42.160
this ability to feel
allows you to get this realization

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:48.400
that you are not just you but
you are part of a larger reality.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:57.360
That you exist as part of a larger system,
of a larger reality that transcends you.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.560
And this is the beginning of what is called
collective consciousness.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:06.160
So we have individual
consciousness: I am breathing,

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.280
I am seeing you, I am hearing
you, you are seeing me,

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.840
so that is our individual consciousness.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.440
But when this inner energy
rises, it is only through

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.960
the awakening of this energy center

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:23.680
that allows us to feel
through the sympathetic system

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.000
what is actually happening within
the parasympathetic system.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.600
So let me repeat that.

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:35.520
These nerves at the tips of our fingers
do not have parasympathetic endings.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.480
So what is otherwise happening
within the parasympathetic,

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.120
we would have no ability to know.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:46.640
It is only because of this
energy center that we can feel

00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.840
this sensation in our hands -
what is happening

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:51.840
within the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.840
And which is why the founder
of this system of meditation,

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:59.840
Shri Mataji, always used to
say that in order to feel

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.920
This cool breeze,
what She called vibrations,

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:07.840
you need to have this energy center
that is in a very good condition,

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.480
that is in a healthy condition
and therefore it is very important

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:15.440
to keep this center
in a great working condition

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.960
so that you can feel it.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:26.560
It is a bit complex,
but that is how we begin to comprehend

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.920
and to experience
collective consciousness.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.560
Well, Dr. Ashish, every single discussion with you
has been so much interesting.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.360
We have learnt a lot with you
and I do want to once again

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:40.720
thank you for your time today

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.760
and we look forward to talking
to you on the next episode

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.280
about the next energy center.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:46.560
Thanks once again.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.360
Thank you again.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.480
And we would encourage our viewers to follow
the meditation video that is going to be guided

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:59.120
by the founder of this meditation and we wish you
all the very best in your experiment

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:02.920
and this experience with Sahaj meditation.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:03.960
Thank you.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.040
Shri Mataji: Now we come to the other
center of Vishuddhi chakra.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.760
This is the
most important in the sense

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:23.920
that it ends all your evolution as far as
human life is concerned.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.400
This has got sixteen petals.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.960
Outside in the gross it
manifests the cervical plexus

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:34.400
and controls your ear, nose, throat, muscles,

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.600
your eyes and your face.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:46.720
Also it controls the first bone and all the bones
that go up to the cranial bones.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:55.120
It is the center of your responsibility
by which you feel responsibility.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:22:01.280
But when this center is awakened,
the greater center represents them here,

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:06.400
because all these centers are represented again
in a bigger way in the brain.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:12.800
So this center when it is awakened,
which is a bigger, larger center of this,

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.040
you become collectively conscious.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.536
This is the center of collectivity.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.920
Keep your eyes closed.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:34.800
First of all, please put your right hand
on your heart.

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.800
All the time the left hand is towards Me.

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:49.120
Now, here you have to say in your heart,
with all sincerity, Mother, am I the Spirit?

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:51.760
Ask the question three times
in your heart.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.870
This is a very fundamental question.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:21.120
Now bring the right hand
on to the left hand side of your stomach,

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.040
in the upper part.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.400
Here press it.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:34.880
Now this is the center of your mastery,
your guidance, your guru Tattva, as they say.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.280
So ask a question,
Mother, am I my own master?

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.600
This is the question to be asked
three times.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:47.431
Mother, am I my own master?

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:07.360
Now bring your right hand down below
in the lower part of the abdomen.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:15.040
Now this is the center from which
all the Divine work is done,

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.840
all the pure work is done.

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.960
So to ask six times,
because this center has got six petals,

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:28.640
Mother, please give me pure knowledge.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.840
Six times you just ask.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:37.071
As a result of this asking
the Kundalini starts getting awakened.

00:24:47.951 --> 00:24:52.720
Now to help the Kundalini to rise
you have to cooperate with Her.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.880
So please put your right hand
on the left hand side

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:06.080
in the upper part of your abdomen
and press it on the stomach.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.760
Now here you have to say
with full confidence,

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:18.480
to help the Kundalini to rise,
Mother, I am my own master.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:20.720
This you have to say ten times.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.760
These are the ten commandments
which you have to say,

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:28.495
that Mother, I am my own master.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:11.280
Now, ten times with full confidence.

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:21.360
Now please raise your right hand
to your heart.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:28.240
Now here you have to say,
again with full confidence,

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.640
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.040
This is the truth, you are the Spirit.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:38.480
But you have to say with full confidence,
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:43.236
This you have to say twelve times.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:17.840
Now one has to know
that God Almighty is the ocean of love.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:22.720
But above all He is the ocean
of forgiveness.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.560
So He forgives.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.200
Whatever wrong you do He forgives.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:34.880
So don't feel guilty
and put your right hand across

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:43.360
on the left hand side in the corner
which is made by your neck and your shoulder.

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:47.520
Now here you have to say
again with full confidence,

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.280
sixteen times, Mother, I am not guilty.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.560
Please say it, Mother, I am not guilty.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.000
Sixteen times.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.363
I am not guilty at all.

00:28:01.363 --> 00:28:09.499
Please say it.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:49.040
Now raise your hand across on your forehead
and it's a very important center.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:59.840
Here you have to say from your heart,
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.080
Please say it from your heart.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.160
How many times is not the point.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.560
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:12.240
Now some would say
that it's very difficult to forgive.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:18.160
But it's a myth
that we do not forgive or we forgive.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:21.040
We do not do anything
in both the cases.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:25.040
But if we don't forgive
then we play into wrong hands.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:32.028
So please say from your heart,
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:46.640
Now please take your hand on the back agnya,
the same center, on the back side of your head

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:51.680
and allow your head to rest on it
and push it back a little bit.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:59.040
Now here you have to say
for your satisfaction,

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:05.520
because you always feel guilty,
that, O Divine, if I have done anything wrong,

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.830
please forgive me.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:23.040
Please forgive me, from your heart.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:29.600
Stretch your hand fully
and put your center of your palm

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:38.400
on top of the fontanel bone area,
which was a very soft bone in your childhood.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.600
Press it hard.

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:43.120
Press hard your scalp.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:49.360
Now you have to move it seven times
saying one thing, which you have to ask for,

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.640
Mother, please give us My Self-realization,
because I cannot force on you.
