00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.960
Today we are celebrating here,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.760
in this Holy land,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.840
the birthday of Shri Krishna.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.120
Shri Krishna is the ultimate,

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.400
of the Fatherhood that I described to you before,

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.600
Who came on this earth,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.600
and illustrated the ultimate of that.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.920
So on this earth the highest Fatherhood is,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.480
Shri Krishna's awareness.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:15.120
But in the Kingdom of God, we can say in the,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.040
Heavens or even above everything else,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.120
resides Sadashiva who does not take incarnations.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.560
He is one of the aspects; Shri Krishna

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.640
is one of the aspects of Sadashiva which is the Father.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.320
And the Adi Shakti or the Holy Ghost

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.320
is the other aspect of Sadashiva which is His Power.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.120
So when Shri Krishna incarnated on this earth,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.960
an aspect of this Adi Shakti

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.040
came on this earth as Radha.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.960
She's the same who came as the Mother of Christ,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.920
and She gave the name of Christ,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.800
as the surname of Shri Krishna,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.560
as if it's Shri Krishna's name Krishna, from Krishna.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.360
He's called as Krist in Indian languages - Krist.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.120
And I have told you before why He was called as Jesu or Yesu.

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.000
So today we are going to see to the two aspects of Shri Krishna,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.240
which were the manifestation of His Divine birth.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.400
In Rama's life they showed a man,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:45.280
a purushottama the best of the Father in worldly affairs.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.920
And in Shri Krishna's life they showed Him,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.360
the highest Fatherhood as in Yogeshwara

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.760
or in Divine world.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.760
So the first aspect of Krishna we have to understand

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.720
is the Yogeshwara,

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.240
and the second aspect of Him as the Virata.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.320
Yogeshwara means the Lord of the Yoga,

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.800
or the power of Yoga.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.080
He is called because He reached the,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.680
optimum that one has to reach as a yogi.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.160
As if He's the ideal that you have to reach.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.960
Now as a Yogi He was born of a royal family

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.240
but He lived in the jungles, in the forest,

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.800
with the cows, with ordinary people.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.680
He used to sleep on the ordinary places

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.880
like sometimes on the stone or on the grass

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:00.440
when He would go with His cows for their feeding.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.600
Secondly He was very, very aware,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.680
absolutely aware of His powers, without any Ego.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.720
He had a special power called samharashakti

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.880
by which He could destroy all those people

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.280
who tried to harm the Divine manifestation.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.000
The samharashakti is expressed

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.280
as the chakra in His hand.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.680
And another is the gada in His Hand.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.000
These powers were within Him and,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.880
He acted according to the power of Radha

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.560
because She was the One

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.200
who sustained the power of Shri Krishna.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.720
The proof of that is this, that

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:06.680
when He was in Gokul with Radha He did all his

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.880
samhara, work samharakarya

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.680
and afterwards He just became a sarti

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.440
- is a chariot driver for Arjuna.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:27.000
So for His disciple Arjuna He became even a chariot driver.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.520
The another great quality of Yogeshwara was

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.880
the complete discretion power built in.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.560
So He knew who was a devil and who was not,

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.160
who is good, who is bad;

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.000
who is possessed, who is not possessed;

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.000
who is innocent who is not.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.080
This was built in within Him, this power,

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:58.360
of complete discrimination.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.640
And He had a capacity,

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:24.400
more expressing His witness hood, as a sakshi.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:31.920
He had a capacity, I mean He was a sakshi Himself.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.440
l should say this way is easier to understand.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.240
He was a sakshi means He had the capacity

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.640
of witnessing the whole world as a play.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.600
At the time of Rama, Rama was,

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.120
the one who got involved into His problems,

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:54.920
to show as if He is a full human being.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.560
So that human should not say that He was God

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.960
so how could we accept God

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.160
because He was God after all.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:09.320
Now this capacity in Him to witness,

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:15.040
has to be seen in every yogi.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.520
The element He controls is ether.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.120
We call it as akasha in Sanskrit.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.560
This ether as you know we are using now

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.960
for our television, for our radio,

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.520
for every sort of a collective work.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.360
So we have to be

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:45.040
in charge of the ether element, as yogis.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:52.600
And that is the subtlest of all, in the sense that,

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.240
you permeate into everything with that.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:02.520
And is above all, like plastic also permeates into everything

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:09.320
into matter, into everything up to the air.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.560
But it cannot enter into ether.

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.640
So the negativity cannot enter into ether.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.560
So when you enter into your ethereal zone,

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.880
you actually enter into the area,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.880
which is thoughtless awareness.

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.560
So to achieve your ethereal state

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.680
you have to expand your thoughtless awareness.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:42.640
And the sustenance of that is done by Christ, by the Spirit.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.440
So you can realize now as a yogi,

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:52.440
your state of mind should be ethereal.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:59.160
And what should be the state of your superego

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.280
- this is the ego part of it that

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.560
you should be in ethereal state -

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:10.040
and as a superego you should see it as a play.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.240
You should see the play of the negative.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.600
Negativity will run away but don't get involved into it,

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.800
play into their hands,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.640
then the negativity will separate from you.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:30.880
So the ego and superego both rise from the visshuddhi chakra.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.840
They can be receded by the agnya chakra

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.240
but are to be sucked in the visshuddhi.

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:42.560
The greatest quality of Yogeshwara is that

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.320
He is not at all involved into anything,

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:48.120
detached absolutely.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.280
If He eats His food He does not eat it,

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.760
if He speaks He does not speak,

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.520
if He sees He does not see,

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:58.680
if He hears He does not hear.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.800
It has no effect on Him, no retention on it,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.640
no action on it.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.320
Whatever He is He is complete.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.200
Sixteen petals is complete mould,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.640
sixteenth day of the moon is the Purnima is the.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:21.120
That is how one has to be, complete in oneself,

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.400
complete confidence in oneself.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.360
But the confidence should not be confused with ego.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:34.480
But confidence is complete wisdom, is complete dharma.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.680
It is complete love, complete beauty,

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.320
and is complete God.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.720
That's what it should be.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.320
Now when He said that you give up

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.600
all your dharmas and surrender to me in Gita

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.160
what He was meaning -

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.440
that all other things about which you are worried you give up

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.840
and become, one with me so I look after you.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:08.080
Give up the responsibility to Shri Krishna.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.920
So the complete integrated Divinity

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.200
will start expressing through you.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.760
Means if you say that you have to be responsible,

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.200
then He says: 'All right go ahead, try.'

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:32.640
But if you say, that you are responsible,

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:39.240
I am just an institution or an instrument in Your hand,

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.280
then, you start manifesting it well,

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:52.040
and that is how your visshuddhi chakra gets opened out.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.560
This is some part of the Yogeshwara l have spoken to you.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:02.520
But as He is the brain within us,

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.160
He becomes the brain within us.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:12.640
We have to know all the qualities of a Divine brain,

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.360
are with Him.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.880
So whatever we do with our brain,

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:24.000
like intrigue, thieving,

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.040
the deception,

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:44.160
all which are bad things by your brain as they call it,

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.680
are done by Him for the Divine purpose,

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:52.880
without getting any blemish upon Himself.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:56.360
And the other side of it whatever we do,

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:02.920
so called positive, like politics or like diplomacy,

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.000
like leadership,

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.280
all that is,

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.400
His Own doing, like even the thinking,

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.240
of the future and all that He does for us

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:28.000
- planning, thinking all those things, administration -

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:33.160
as a play, everything is done as a play,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.760
because He is the Master, as we call as a sutradara

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.920
the one who does the prologue in a drama

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:46.120
the one who plays with the strings, with the pantomimes.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:49.920
Now the other thing that we have to understand,

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.880
Shri Krishna at this stage of Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:57.760
that it is the Virata Shakti that is manifesting at this time,

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:03.040
and not the Shri Krishna Shakti which was at His time.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.920
And the power that is working here is no more

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:13.080
that of Radha, or of Mary, but of Viratangana.

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.520
That's why the knowledge of Sahaja Yogis is,

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.760
much wider,

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:25.400
than the knowledge of all the Saints, of ages.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:29.920
But is not deeper than them.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:34.160
If you can deepen your knowledge,

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.520
this wider knowledge will have proper roots within you.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.040
So the brain are the roots,

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:45.960
here are the roots of the whole, tree of life.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:52.240
Actually Kundalini comes up and waters the brain first

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.720
so that the whole tree of life is

00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:01.040
drenched in the Divine bliss, and Divine knowledge.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.960
So this Virata Shakti that we have to work out

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.840
gives us the sense of collective consciousness first.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.560
First we understand it through our brainpower.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:19.360
But the whole brainpower is to be guided by the heart.

00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:24.200
Is to be, watered

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.560
but in Sanskrit is a very beautiful word sinchena -

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:34.840
like dewdrops you see, sprayed with the love of God.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.640
So the integration of this brain

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.480
has to take with heart and with your liver.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.920
Then only the Virata Shakti takes another form.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:56.040
The weapons of killing, become the weapons of forgiveness.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:03.520
Every sort of destructive power is used for the construction,

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.360
as if it is tricked,

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:13.560
like now I told them a trick how to trick these gurus.

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.840
The power that they have can be tricked against them

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.520
as He said that their teeth must be put into their necks,

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.760
into their throats.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.040
instead of taking out their teeth

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.040
better put them back into their own throats.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.280
And if you can do that, then there is no problem,

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.760
as far as their effect on us is concerned

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.640
because you are more powerful and more tricky.

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.680
Because the Virata Shakti has now taken that form.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.760
Like the tree when it grows it grows upward,

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.160
but when it is laden with fruit it comes down.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:57.080
First it is attractive by its flowers, by its timber,

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.880
by its all other parts of its body.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:05.160
And people try to destroy it for it.

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.640
But when the fruits appear they want to preserve it,

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:15.120
and the tree bends down, its humility is very valuable.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.920
So you are the fruits,

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.280
that Viratangana Shakti, you are the fruits.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.120
Because you are so valuable,

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:30.960
that those people who wanted to ruin

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:34.840
or to destroy the Divine power from this earth

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.800
will start thinking that

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.520
they have to gain something out of these fruits.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:46.080
So today the Virata Shakti has given you a great value,

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.600
because people see that by having

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:51.760
one Sahaja Yogi with them it is so precious.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:56.960
Say one ordinary man gets his Realization,

00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.400
then he develops his value,

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:07.840
in that - his own value, he can be respected, loved

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:13.600
and given the highest, if he's a proper Sahaja Yogi.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:21.040
So you should understand today that Virata Shakti is-

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:24.480
we are going to worship that Virata Shakti

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.240
which has given fruits.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:32.840
As a result of that all these different churches

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.880
and fanaticism and atheism, and communism

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.840
and all that 'ism' - all these will neutralize

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.920
because they will see they've benefited it.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.800
But you have to become that,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.040
that is the biggest thing one has to know

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.440
is to bend down towards the Mother Earth,

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.840
to be humble.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:00.960
Absolutely the humility inside out,

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.280
is really going to give you

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:07.000
the complete value of Sahaja Yoga fruits.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:13.320
Those Sahaja Yogis who boast about themselves

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:19.480
are like the fruits which are getting ruined

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.360
only on the tree.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:24.920
The only fruits which bend down

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.320
are accepted as good and matured fruits

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:37.200
and not those who assert that they are the highest.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:41.240
But some of the negative people

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:46.280
should not by any chance take advantage of this,

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:50.440
and say that, they are good

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:55.960
because they are bending down, it's not the logic.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.400
Some of them boast they are humble,

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.560
even a rotten fruit bends down.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.480
But the matured fruit,

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:21.800
shows its humility by its weight.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.720
That is the Guru tattwa, weight.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:32.280
So from the Viratangana power,

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:38.920
we get the power of maturity up to the fruit

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:46.640
and then we become blessed by Guru Principle.

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.280
Those who are still involved,

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.120
in getting to better sunshine,

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:57.040
or getting to better water supply,

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:00.200
or all these things are not yet matured

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.400
because the fruit doesn't need anything anymore.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.640
It doesn't need anything from the Mother Earth,

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:08.160
nor from the elements.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:14.560
But it surrenders, it bends, it bows to the Mother Earth.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.160
So the Sahaja Yogi who goes on asking questions to Mother,

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:27.160
bringing personal problems, stupid ideas, negativity,

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.720
all those people are still not yet the fruits.

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:37.080
But the matured people are those who surrender,

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.520
who bow to the Mother Earth.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:45.760
So the capacity to bow is the best judgment of yourself;

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.000
and leaving everything,

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:55.280
to the power of gravity of Your Mother

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.560
to do every work for you;

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:03.600
and leaving all your small little worries behind.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:15.080
You have to rise above, these restricting powers.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:21.720
And achieve the completion of this Virata Shakti,

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.840
which ultimately becomes a madhura Shakti,

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:28.360
madhura. There's no word in English language

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.280
but it means a sweet power.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.880
Like the fruit becomes sweet,

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.720
that's how you all have to become very sweet.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:43.000
Krishna tried to make everything very sweet in the sense

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.400
it was all madhura shakti that was acting,

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.840
all His play, all His dancing,

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.160
all His stories if you read

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.160
is nothing but madhura shakti

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.520
- towards gopas and gopis,

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.320
towards other Sahaja Yogis.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.360
So you have to keep your Mother pleased

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.480
by pleasing all other Sahaja Yogis,

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:09.640
and not other people, they are not important.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.120
So today we are going to shorten the Puja

00:25:15.320 --> 00:25:19.480
and that's why it took so much time upstairs to shorten it.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.320
So the time lost is time gained forever and ever.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:30.040
May God bless you all.
