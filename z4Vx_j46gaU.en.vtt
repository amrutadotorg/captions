00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:01.962
﻿Adi Shakti Puja, Detachment, Rahuri (India), 11 December 1988.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.734
Puja has to start at the time, when it has to start

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.445
I’ve been waiting and waiting and waiting,

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:18.479
then I realised that today is a very good

00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:21.483
time according to the calendar;

00:00:21.684 --> 00:00:26.526
but it is not in the morning,

00:00:27.992 --> 00:00:31.503
so it had to be the third day of the moon.

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:36.838
And as the moon is changing its phases in the day time,

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:38.852
we had to wait till it started.

00:00:39.103 --> 00:00:41.705
I think, all these things have happened,

00:00:41.906 --> 00:00:46.618
of the theft and everything has happened, perhaps,

00:00:46.982 --> 00:00:51.331
to delay the Puja up to the point where it should start.

00:00:51.535 --> 00:00:54.881
So in Sahaja Yoga we all go beyond time

00:00:55.082 --> 00:00:57.947
and we don't have to worry about the timing.

00:00:58.148 --> 00:01:00.832
Only when it's a formal function or something,

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:05.519
because the people are formal and they don't understand our styles.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.056
So we have to be present there at right time,

00:01:09.257 --> 00:01:13.035
otherwise we should just allow the time to take its own course

00:01:13.236 --> 00:01:17.196
and we should move in our own way.

00:01:21.858 --> 00:01:27.006
Now for our travel

00:01:27.207 --> 00:01:31.386
and this tour, we have to realise

00:01:32.286 --> 00:01:39.036
that we are here to achieve

00:01:39.237 --> 00:01:44.934
a certain amount of height in our detachment.

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:49.942
We have to rise into the realm

00:01:50.143 --> 00:01:55.878
of our state,

00:01:57.442 --> 00:02:00.641
while the circumstances around us,

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:07.922
they're surrounding us and they should not make us unhappy,

00:02:08.826 --> 00:02:14.391
or biased, or we should not react to them,

00:02:14.837 --> 00:02:20.814
On the contrary we should try to rise above that.

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:27.302
If there are no events of mishaps.

00:02:28.185 --> 00:02:32.592
Then you cannot see the surmounting quality of the Divine.

00:02:34.695 --> 00:02:40.594
If the surmounting quality of The Divine has to be seen,

00:02:40.795 --> 00:02:43.762
we have to see the obstructions.

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:46.514
For example,

00:02:46.715 --> 00:02:51.723
if there is the flow of the water going on

00:02:53.046 --> 00:02:55.603
and it is smoothly moving,

00:02:55.804 --> 00:03:00.854
there's no happening as you call the ghatana,

00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:05.799
there is no happening, but if there is a stone,

00:03:06.347 --> 00:03:08.799
then the water splashes against it,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.244
creates a beauty and surpasses it,

00:03:15.355 --> 00:03:20.886
this is the sign of Divine

00:03:21.174 --> 00:03:27.679
surmounting all the difficulties that are supposed to be there.

00:03:29.271 --> 00:03:31.713
Now we are proceeding to Pune

00:03:31.914 --> 00:03:36.431
and where we will be having a proper session

00:03:36.632 --> 00:03:39.093
also for marriages and all that.

00:03:39.294 --> 00:03:42.477
We will have to take a firm decision.

00:03:42.678 --> 00:03:46.889
I must speak about it today,

00:03:47.143 --> 00:03:52.459
that the steadiness of the mind is very important for the marriages.

00:03:52.674 --> 00:03:57.168
If you have certain concepts

00:03:57.794 --> 00:04:03.582
and if you are whimsical, it's better you don't get married,

00:04:04.764 --> 00:04:07.566
because that's not found in Indian character,

00:04:07.761 --> 00:04:11.499
once they decide for marriage they are married forever.

00:04:11.798 --> 00:04:15.449
But if the mind is still wavering, going up and down,

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.726
it's a trick of the mind

00:04:17.927 --> 00:04:21.466
that wants to play tricks with others

00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:25.428
and enjoys, it is a sign of ego.

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:28.155
Absolutely a sign of ego

00:04:28.356 --> 00:04:32.159
and then you start playing games,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.092
you enjoy it, "yes, no, yes, no".

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.478
You go on enjoying those games

00:04:39.804 --> 00:04:42.137
and later on you play into it so much

00:04:42.338 --> 00:04:45.217
that your marriages can never be happy or successful.

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:48.739
That means you are not yet matured for marriage.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.408
For marriage you are to be matured.

00:04:51.609 --> 00:04:54.562
But one of the reasons for this I find in the west is,

00:04:54.763 --> 00:04:58.193
that you have had no training at all.

00:04:58.407 --> 00:05:01.608
Parents have never told you how to behave

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:04.811
towards your husband, towards your wife,

00:05:05.012 --> 00:05:07.450
how to make a marriage successful.

00:05:07.651 --> 00:05:10.771
That is a very important event

00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:13.562
and that we should try

00:05:13.763 --> 00:05:17.390
to establish ourselves in the marriage system.

00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:24.708
Instead of that, we use it as a nice trick playing ground,

00:05:25.081 --> 00:05:28.864
we miss the point, who is the loser?

00:05:29.348 --> 00:05:32.851
If you go on playing tricks like this

00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:35.975
and playing with your ego, whatever you may do,

00:05:36.176 --> 00:05:40.957
whatever you may do, whatever type of marriages you'll have,

00:05:41.703 --> 00:05:43.718
you can never be happy.

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.735
Now in the west, as you know, I lead another life also

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:50.572
and every person I have met,

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.493
every person whatever country they may come,

00:05:53.694 --> 00:05:58.012
nobody seems to be happy in their marriage, is very surprising.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:02.875
It seems every wife finds something wrong with the husband,

00:06:03.121 --> 00:06:05.633
the husband finds something wrong with the wife

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:09.126
and they have funny miserable faces.

00:06:09.327 --> 00:06:14.333
They don't look like married people, but as if like criminals,

00:06:14.831 --> 00:06:17.161
or something has really gone wrong with them.

00:06:17.362 --> 00:06:20.742
There's no smile on their face, they look horrid,

00:06:20.943 --> 00:06:24.008
because they have missed the point.

00:06:24.325 --> 00:06:27.915
Marriage is to be enjoyed, is for your enjoyment.

00:06:28.116 --> 00:06:33.727
Supposing one gives you ambrose...,

00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:37.821
ambrosia. "Amrut", as they call it

00:06:39.207 --> 00:06:41.980
and then you start playing trick with it.

00:06:42.181 --> 00:06:44.688
Who is the loser?

00:06:45.736 --> 00:06:51.406
So must know that we have to achieved that maturity

00:06:53.054 --> 00:06:54.967
and enjoy that love.

00:06:55.168 --> 00:06:57.788
Basically if something is very wrong,

00:06:58.072 --> 00:07:03.590
or if there's no possibility of a proper marriage,

00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:07.686
in Sahaja Yoga we have arrangement, to give it up.

00:07:08.205 --> 00:07:11.921
You can change your wife, change your husband, no problem.

00:07:12.122 --> 00:07:14.457
But there must be some reason behind it,

00:07:14.658 --> 00:07:20.474
just for fun's sake, if you want to spoil your life.

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:22.875
I'll try my level best to tell you

00:07:23.076 --> 00:07:26.319
that don't spoil your life and of the other person.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.155
But people enjoy sometimes, spoiling somebody lives

00:07:31.356 --> 00:07:33.525
when it comes to the ego part.

00:07:33.726 --> 00:07:37.314
They themselves cannot enjoy. "Dog in the manger" policy.

00:07:37.515 --> 00:07:40.714
Dog in the manger cannot eat the grass,

00:07:40.915 --> 00:07:44.879
but barks at any bull that comes to eat it, it's like this.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.993
Neither they will enjoy, nor they will allow others to enjoy.

00:07:50.194 --> 00:07:53.686
And when such stupid couples are there,

00:07:53.887 --> 00:07:56.683
I have such a headache all the time, reconciling them,

00:07:56.884 --> 00:07:58.684
talking to them, asking them.

00:07:58.885 --> 00:08:03.245
I mean it becomes a marriage bureau for me.

00:08:03.446 --> 00:08:06.019
And sometimes I reach such a conclusion:

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.823
no more marriages in Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it!

00:08:10.024 --> 00:08:12.093
Actually what have I to gain out of it.

00:08:12.294 --> 00:08:14.064
This is nobody will try to understand.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.454
What I am trying is to make you happy,

00:08:16.655 --> 00:08:18.724
to get you good husbands and good wives,

00:08:18.941 --> 00:08:21.655
that you should have good relationships,

00:08:21.856 --> 00:08:25.150
you should have great people on this Earth, to be born,

00:08:25.351 --> 00:08:28.021
that we should have a society

00:08:28.222 --> 00:08:32.188
which is beyond all these nonsensical societies,

00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:37.233
which is so great that we can create a homogenous family

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:41.371
among ourselves of purity and of holiness.

00:08:41.572 --> 00:08:44.741
Instead of that, for petty nonsensical things

00:08:44.942 --> 00:08:48.788
if there's a fight going on, one gets really fed up.

00:08:49.003 --> 00:08:52.910
Of course one has to try.

00:08:53.547 --> 00:08:56.555
But if you are bent upon cutting your noses,

00:08:56.756 --> 00:09:01.359
how can I go on clipping them back?

00:09:01.896 --> 00:09:07.348
It's an eternal problem, if you marry your say, 75 people,

00:09:07.549 --> 00:09:09.555
you have the enjoyment of it.

00:09:09.756 --> 00:09:17.851
Now if it's a, say, a ocean of, Indian Ocean say for example.

00:09:18.431 --> 00:09:23.051
But then you get the Pacific Ocean back on your head

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:29.211
with all the cries and weeping and shouting and screaming

00:09:29.412 --> 00:09:33.238
and all sorts of nonsense that's going on.

00:09:34.475 --> 00:09:37.843
So I again say that, now we are going to Pune

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:41.876
where all the marriages are going to be confirmed.

00:09:42.106 --> 00:09:44.913
If you go on like this there's no end to it,

00:09:45.113 --> 00:09:50.097
also those people who come for marriages and deny it twice,

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:52.701
third time I don't ask them,

00:09:52.902 --> 00:09:57.116
because it's a joke going on.

00:09:59.043 --> 00:10:03.745
You do not know how many nights I have spent selecting people,

00:10:03.968 --> 00:10:07.507
as it is you are from twenty five, thirty countries.

00:10:07.708 --> 00:10:09.711
Yesterday you saw that.

00:10:09.912 --> 00:10:12.799
You have different conditionings,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.005
different styles, different everything,

00:10:16.206 --> 00:10:19.556
heights different, ages different, faces different,

00:10:19.757 --> 00:10:22.775
aptitudes different.

00:10:23.489 --> 00:10:28.060
So combine all these things, so very difficult.

00:10:28.329 --> 00:10:31.426
Sometimes I think if you are overeducated,

00:10:31.627 --> 00:10:34.077
them better to give you a simple woman,

00:10:34.278 --> 00:10:37.111
so that your little pressure is reduced,

00:10:37.325 --> 00:10:41.819
you can share with her but if you are equally educated people,

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.358
then both the heads may be...

00:10:51.715 --> 00:10:56.635
So I have to think of many things and of vibrations,

00:10:56.836 --> 00:10:59.434
but somehow or other you can defy

00:10:59.635 --> 00:11:02.434
and you try to defy it, alright doesn't matter,

00:11:02.635 --> 00:11:06.180
but who is the loser is the point.

00:11:06.386 --> 00:11:08.693
Today I had to speak to you about this,

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:13.653
because in Sahaj we have to take the way it comes as it comes.

00:11:13.854 --> 00:11:17.683
Whatever comes in our way we should take it.

00:11:17.974 --> 00:11:20.749
We should not sort of say: I've fallen in love.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:25.660
There's nobody falls in love, it rises in love in Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:33.197 --> 00:11:38.022
That is some funny idea, that one must fall in love;

00:11:38.237 --> 00:11:43.625
because you see that means you must do something sinful,

00:11:44.023 --> 00:11:45.555
or something absurd.

00:11:45.756 --> 00:11:47.167
So many people have told me:

00:11:47.368 --> 00:11:49.468
"Mother, I have not fallen in love with her."

00:11:49.669 --> 00:11:55.312
How can you fall in love, you fall into some ditch, or you may fall,

00:11:55.837 --> 00:11:59.770
fall into some river or something like that.

00:11:59.971 --> 00:12:05.016
I didn't understand how do you fall in love, it's a solid stuff.

00:12:10.297 --> 00:12:16.086
So this absurd idea of falling in love has to be given up,

00:12:17.995 --> 00:12:23.344
if it means that you have felt the love,

00:12:23.582 --> 00:12:30.600
or if it means that you have the sensitivity of feeling the love,

00:12:30.801 --> 00:12:33.619
or something I can understand, I'm a little explanatory,

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.089
but this falling in love business

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.311
has been going on and on and on.

00:12:38.511 --> 00:12:39.904
Now I would request you

00:12:40.105 --> 00:12:45.262
that in Sahaja Yoga we cancel this terminology.

00:12:47.494 --> 00:12:54.017
So problems of marriages should not arise in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:54.272 --> 00:12:58.260
You got chance for one month to decide for yourself

00:12:58.461 --> 00:13:00.535
and to find out for yourself.

00:13:00.736 --> 00:13:03.782
Little bit adjustments and understanding

00:13:03.983 --> 00:13:08.819
can create such a beautiful world for you.

00:13:09.391 --> 00:13:14.832
It's just waiting there, but suddenly you decide on some spot,

00:13:15.033 --> 00:13:17.630
suddenly you're alright I find,

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:20.941
at the spur of the moment I find suddenly: "No",

00:13:21.142 --> 00:13:22.188
I say: "What's this?"

00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:24.914
The horse was going alright suddenly what has happened?

00:13:25.115 --> 00:13:26.163
it has turned round?

00:13:26.364 --> 00:13:28.939
One can understand a horse,

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.388
but I can't understand human beings.

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:37.564
So this whimsical behaviour suddenly,

00:13:38.834 --> 00:13:43.291
can be very injurious to the growth of Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:43.838 --> 00:13:47.389
Whenever I go to England there's a list of people

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.416
from all over the country,

00:13:49.617 --> 00:13:53.240
this marriage has gone rotten, that has gone rotten,

00:13:53.441 --> 00:13:54.682
that has gone rotten,

00:13:54.883 --> 00:13:56.351
while I'm boasting to everyone

00:13:56.552 --> 00:13:58.393
that Sahaja Yoga marriages never fail.

00:13:58.594 --> 00:14:01.307
I know it's not true,

00:14:01.712 --> 00:14:06.430
but whatever I say is a Mantra, ultimately it becomes the truth.

00:14:06.631 --> 00:14:11.349
So time will come when no marriages will fail,

00:14:11.706 --> 00:14:15.708
but you have to join hands with me and co-operate

00:14:15.909 --> 00:14:19.863
and should understand, how much I have worked hard

00:14:20.064 --> 00:14:23.914
to bring about these events.

00:14:25.132 --> 00:14:28.301
And marriages should not make you happy or unhappy,

00:14:28.502 --> 00:14:33.148
because to marry is not the ultimate in life.

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.787
But it happens after marriage people get lost,

00:14:36.988 --> 00:14:38.516
they don't come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:38.717 --> 00:14:43.518
after that, we are enjoying our honeymoon for the last three years.

00:14:43.812 --> 00:14:47.592
Wonderful Sahaja Yogis who are leaders suddenly get lost.

00:14:47.793 --> 00:14:51.311
That also may be a fall in love maybe, I don't know,

00:14:51.512 --> 00:14:55.457
but this kind of nonsense, even if it is one or two

00:14:55.658 --> 00:14:58.403
its such a headache.

00:15:01.527 --> 00:15:05.438
And I really don't know how to solve these problems,

00:15:05.639 --> 00:15:08.812
because I think there's no problem at all.

00:15:09.013 --> 00:15:12.980
Only thing you have decided not to enjoy anything.

00:15:14.712 --> 00:15:17.597
Supposing you don't want to enjoy the food,

00:15:17.798 --> 00:15:20.286
you can put some quinine on your tongue

00:15:20.487 --> 00:15:21.998
and then say I don't like the food,

00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:26.296
something like that. It's absurd.

00:15:26.496 --> 00:15:28.799
So try to help me in this,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.348
otherwise I'll give up this marriage business I tell you

00:15:32.548 --> 00:15:34.880
because it doesn't give me any joy or pleasure.

00:15:35.087 --> 00:15:40.360
Even one person plays like that I just don't understand.

00:15:42.674 --> 00:15:46.824
And for no rhyme and reason you should not say 'no'.

00:15:47.157 --> 00:15:50.836
First of all your must look at yourself in the mirror.

00:15:51.898 --> 00:15:54.171
What are you?

00:15:54.441 --> 00:15:57.802
What is your education? What is your intellect?

00:15:58.064 --> 00:16:00.788
What do you expect from another person?

00:16:01.106 --> 00:16:02.419
How much money you have got?

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.180
How much money the other person has got?

00:16:04.381 --> 00:16:08.559
Whatever you want to see, you can see for yourself, to begin with,

00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.320
then compare.

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:13.697
But the greatest thing you have to think about,

00:16:13.898 --> 00:16:18.265
how many vibrations you have?

00:16:20.699 --> 00:16:23.153
How much Sahaja Yoga the other one knows?

00:16:23.354 --> 00:16:25.847
You are married for your ascent.

00:16:26.048 --> 00:16:32.717
If the other person has vibrations much more than yours,

00:16:32.918 --> 00:16:38.685
then your should not unnecessarily boast of nonsensical gross things.

00:16:38.886 --> 00:16:43.484
The person is much subtler, make use of that.

00:16:44.357 --> 00:16:48.417
Whether it's a woman or a man I don't say,

00:16:48.937 --> 00:16:52.147
but I just say that see for yourself," where are you?"

00:16:52.348 --> 00:16:55.789
Specially for beginners who are beginning to take to Sahaja Yoga,

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.412
is better to marry some mature Sahaja Yogi

00:16:58.613 --> 00:17:02.220
so that they can ascend very well, much faster.

00:17:02.854 --> 00:17:06.524
And also if the other party is not so good, maybe,

00:17:06.725 --> 00:17:10.281
we have to work, we have to save that person,

00:17:10.482 --> 00:17:15.606
after all, they are not yet matured but they are Sahaja Yogis,

00:17:15.884 --> 00:17:21.103
they want to do, so try to work it out in that way.

00:17:22.342 --> 00:17:25.075
I think you will understand the seriousness,

00:17:25.276 --> 00:17:27.656
this is the most important work

00:17:27.857 --> 00:17:32.505
that ever happened on this Earth so far.

00:17:32.759 --> 00:17:35.418
Your marriages are very important

00:17:35.619 --> 00:17:37.392
and you have seen the photographs

00:17:37.593 --> 00:17:40.946
where the Gods themselves have blessed you.

00:17:41.147 --> 00:17:44.413
Because of my consent, because of my selection,

00:17:44.614 --> 00:17:46.788
they all were present in your marriage

00:17:46.989 --> 00:17:50.537
and how they were giving you tributes

00:17:50.738 --> 00:17:55.287
and how they were putting flowers on the brides.

00:17:55.488 --> 00:17:59.509
You have seen the photographs. If you have not seen I will show you.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.061
But if you are not a seeker,

00:18:02.262 --> 00:18:04.553
and if you are not seeking your higher ascent,

00:18:04.754 --> 00:18:08.249
then you go into nonsensical things and nonsensical ideas.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:11.967
So better be careful not to do such a thing,

00:18:12.178 --> 00:18:14.272
don't think too much of yourself.

00:18:14.473 --> 00:18:16.947
Another note of caution,

00:18:17.148 --> 00:18:22.301
that you see the way Indians pamper their son-in-laws,

00:18:22.502 --> 00:18:25.012
so don't get mad.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.711
Also they pamper their daughter-in-laws very much.

00:18:28.912 --> 00:18:32.239
It's done in India to create better relationships,

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.267
because we don't have the balloon of ego so much here.

00:18:35.468 --> 00:18:41.068
But here as soon as somebody pays attention to you, you go off,

00:18:41.385 --> 00:18:43.254
so better be careful.

00:18:43.472 --> 00:18:46.298
It's a custom here to look after the son-in-law,

00:18:46.499 --> 00:18:49.904
to look after the daughter, there is a custom.

00:18:50.147 --> 00:18:53.084
Now it is ingrained from ages,

00:18:53.285 --> 00:18:55.676
it doesn't mean that you are God,

00:18:55.877 --> 00:18:59.714
or you are in some superlative condition.

00:19:00.717 --> 00:19:04.695
It's just that, that is how they pamper,

00:19:04.896 --> 00:19:07.163
they look after the daughter-in-law,

00:19:07.364 --> 00:19:10.736
or the son-in-law, normally.

00:19:11.077 --> 00:19:14.951
And you should not carry away ideas,

00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:18.013
which I must tell you because it doesn't happen in the west,

00:19:18.214 --> 00:19:19.563
I have seen, they don't care.

00:19:19.764 --> 00:19:23.143
Once that they are married, they are finished, it's not so,

00:19:23.344 --> 00:19:24.642
so please be careful.

00:19:24.843 --> 00:19:26.212
When you are marrying Indians,

00:19:26.413 --> 00:19:30.666
you will find the parents will quite pamper you, look after you,

00:19:30.867 --> 00:19:34.351
they'll call you to their house, do this, give you money,

00:19:34.552 --> 00:19:38.993
give you ornaments, all kinds of things they'll do.

00:19:39.517 --> 00:19:45.048
But still one has to understand that is just a custom

00:19:45.755 --> 00:19:47.173
and should not get pampered,

00:19:47.374 --> 00:19:49.879
on the contrary should feel blissful about it.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.685
But when it is done I have seen suddenly they go off

00:19:53.886 --> 00:19:55.796
and they think no end of themselves,

00:19:55.997 --> 00:19:58.895
their value system goes off.

00:19:59.096 --> 00:20:02.789
It's because, so far we have had no education,

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:06.545
no training about marriages.

00:20:06.746 --> 00:20:10.001
I am sorry I have to say this in the presence of many Indians.

00:20:10.213 --> 00:20:13.729
But indians also you see, expect you to understand

00:20:13.929 --> 00:20:15.598
their customs sometimes too much.

00:20:15.813 --> 00:20:18.361
For example yesterday the garlands were given

00:20:18.562 --> 00:20:20.489
at the time when the garlands were given,

00:20:20.689 --> 00:20:23.970
you are not supposed to garland yourself,

00:20:24.232 --> 00:20:27.131
but some of you took the garland put it in you. 

00:20:27.332 --> 00:20:31.034
They regarded it as absolutely unmannerly,

00:20:31.269 --> 00:20:32.798
but it is so.

00:20:32.999 --> 00:20:37.160
So when we are in India we have to understand Indians,

00:20:37.343 --> 00:20:40.839
but when we are in the west we have to understand the western people.

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.556
For example in the west you just go on saying,

00:20:43.757 --> 00:20:47.152
thank, thank you, sorry, sorry sorry, sorry sorry sorry.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.903
It is so confusing sometimes.

00:20:50.104 --> 00:20:53.193
We have to go on shaking hands with so many people,

00:20:53.394 --> 00:20:57.237
I mean, I sometimes shake hands with nine hundred people at a time.

00:20:57.484 --> 00:21:01.071
And while they are going back again nine hundred people.

00:21:01.662 --> 00:21:03.991
I think namaste is a better idea,

00:21:04.192 --> 00:21:07.151
than to shake hands with every sort of a person,

00:21:07.352 --> 00:21:10.966
you'll catch from every one. But it's a custom,

00:21:11.167 --> 00:21:14.170
it's custom so we have to understand this is a custom

00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:18.975
and which is not to be resented, is not such a bad custom.

00:21:19.404 --> 00:21:23.731
There's nothing wrong in it and maybe there is no logic.

00:21:23.932 --> 00:21:26.585
For example garlanding yourself there is little logic,

00:21:26.786 --> 00:21:30.404
you don't garland yourself, somebody else has to garland

00:21:30.668 --> 00:21:33.832
and the ladies don't take garlands on their...,

00:21:34.033 --> 00:21:36.816
you see because any man cannot garland a lady,

00:21:37.017 --> 00:21:39.516
because it's only husband has the right,

00:21:39.717 --> 00:21:42.115
see, so anyone won't garland.

00:21:42.316 --> 00:21:45.254
Or a son can garland the mother,

00:21:45.552 --> 00:21:48.531
but any man cannot garland any lady

00:21:48.732 --> 00:21:50.635
who is of a younger age,

00:21:50.836 --> 00:21:54.456
or who is not yet married and even if married,

00:21:54.657 --> 00:21:58.204
she has to be an old woman like me, then it's alright.

00:21:58.486 --> 00:22:02.417
So these are customs very much ingrained and it's best or logic

00:22:02.618 --> 00:22:06.726
that you cannot garland yourself and walk on the street.

00:22:07.307 --> 00:22:11.821
Even if the leaders here are garlanded

00:22:12.022 --> 00:22:15.025
immediately they take out their garland, except for the Gods,

00:22:15.226 --> 00:22:19.577
I mean I can carry with my garland but I also take it out.

00:22:21.817 --> 00:22:24.947
So these are few customs which must be understood

00:22:25.148 --> 00:22:27.744
and there's nothing wrong in it, there's logic.

00:22:27.945 --> 00:22:30.899
Whatever is illogical we can give up,

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:34.785
whatever is logical we have to take it and understand it.

00:22:35.016 --> 00:22:37.670
So I am just telling you, that yesterday they started laughing,

00:22:37.878 --> 00:22:39.821
children also started laughing, because they thought

00:22:40.022 --> 00:22:42.473
they are garlanding themselves.

00:22:42.674 --> 00:22:47.339
It's like doing aarti to yourself, you know,

00:22:47.868 --> 00:22:50.024
amounts to that.

00:22:50.365 --> 00:22:53.494
So you can understand why they were laughing.

00:22:53.695 --> 00:22:58.594
They didn't mean to hurt you in any way, but this is the system.

00:22:59.414 --> 00:23:03.284
Now coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:03.498 --> 00:23:07.112
yesterday was Left Vishuddhi was too much.

00:23:07.597 --> 00:23:10.363
Perhaps maybe in the morning I said you were allready late

00:23:10.564 --> 00:23:13.840
for the formal programme, I don't know.

00:23:14.041 --> 00:23:17.727
Whatever I say has to be just listened to, that's all.

00:23:17.928 --> 00:23:20.355
Only thing is next time we should not be late,

00:23:20.556 --> 00:23:22.235
in any formal programme.

00:23:22.436 --> 00:23:27.076
But it seems such a Left Vishuddhi was there that I got a lump here

00:23:27.277 --> 00:23:29.339
and I just knew what it was.

00:23:29.563 --> 00:23:31.942
So Mother says to you things

00:23:32.143 --> 00:23:34.193
which should not hurt you in any way

00:23:34.394 --> 00:23:36.524
and you should not take it that seriously

00:23:36.725 --> 00:23:39.349
but should understand that next time we should not do so,

00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:43.009
otherwise you are all wonderful people, you are beautiful people.

00:23:43.303 --> 00:23:45.225
I love you, I adore you, not only that,

00:23:45.401 --> 00:23:47.244
but I am very proud of you.

00:23:47.445 --> 00:23:49.185
I'm extremely proud of you,

00:23:49.386 --> 00:23:51.569
but I have to tell you something sometimes.

00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:55.589
But if I tell you even wee bit then if you, get that upset,

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:59.182
I don't know what should I do.

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:02.983
So not to take things that seriously.

00:24:03.717 --> 00:24:07.199
There's nothing so much wrong.

00:24:07.437 --> 00:24:10.564
In general I have to tell you things which you should understand

00:24:10.765 --> 00:24:13.256
it's for our good, for our enjoyment.

00:24:13.457 --> 00:24:16.082
Everything to increase your enjoyment.

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:20.390
Even your ascent in Sahaja Yoga is to increase your enjoyment,

00:24:20.591 --> 00:24:25.145
your sensitivity to joy to increase it more and more,

00:24:25.463 --> 00:24:28.286
all this is done.

00:24:28.487 --> 00:24:33.257
