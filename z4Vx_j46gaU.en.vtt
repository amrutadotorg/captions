00:00.016 --> 00:01.962
﻿Adi Shakti Puja, Detachment, Rahuri (India), 11 December 1988.

00:03.930 --> 00:07.734
Puja has to start at the time, when it has to start

00:08.309 --> 00:12.445
I’ve been waiting and waiting and waiting,

00:12.629 --> 00:18.479
then I realised that today is a very good

00:18.741 --> 00:21.483
time according to the calendar;

00:21.684 --> 00:26.526
but it is not in the morning,

00:27.992 --> 00:31.503
so it had to be the third day of the moon.

00:31.734 --> 00:36.838
And as the moon is changing its phases in the day time,

00:37.039 --> 00:38.852
we had to wait till it started.

00:39.103 --> 00:41.705
I think, all these things have happened,

00:41.906 --> 00:46.618
of the theft and everything has happened, perhaps,

00:46.982 --> 00:51.331
to delay the Puja up to the point where it should start.

00:51.535 --> 00:54.881
So in Sahaja Yoga we all go beyond time

00:55.082 --> 00:57.947
and we don't have to worry about the timing.

00:58.148 --> 01:00.832
Only when it's a formal function or something,

01:01.033 --> 01:05.519
because the people are formal and they don't understand our styles.

01:05.720 --> 01:09.056
So we have to be present there at right time,

01:09.257 --> 01:13.035
otherwise we should just allow the time to take its own course

01:13.236 --> 01:17.196
and we should move in our own way.

01:21.858 --> 01:27.006
Now for our travel

01:27.207 --> 01:31.386
and this tour, we have to realise

01:32.286 --> 01:39.036
that we are here to achieve

01:39.237 --> 01:44.934
a certain amount of height in our detachment.

01:45.338 --> 01:49.942
We have to rise into the realm

01:50.143 --> 01:55.878
of our state,

01:57.442 --> 02:00.641
while the circumstances around us,

02:00.879 --> 02:07.922
they're surrounding us and they should not make us unhappy,

02:08.826 --> 02:14.391
or biased, or we should not react to them,

02:14.837 --> 02:20.814
On the contrary we should try to rise above that.

02:22.259 --> 02:27.302
If there are no events of mishaps.

02:28.185 --> 02:32.592
Then you cannot see the surmounting quality of the Divine.

02:34.695 --> 02:40.594
If the surmounting quality of The Divine has to be seen,

02:40.795 --> 02:43.762
we have to see the obstructions.

02:43.963 --> 02:46.514
For example,

02:46.715 --> 02:51.723
if there is the flow of the water going on

02:53.046 --> 02:55.603
and it is smoothly moving,

02:55.804 --> 03:00.854
there's no happening as you call the ghatana,

03:01.055 --> 03:05.799
there is no happening, but if there is a stone,

03:06.347 --> 03:08.799
then the water splashes against it,

03:09.000 --> 03:14.244
creates a beauty and surpasses it,

03:15.355 --> 03:20.886
this is the sign of Divine

03:21.174 --> 03:27.679
surmounting all the difficulties that are supposed to be there.

03:29.271 --> 03:31.713
Now we are proceeding to Pune

03:31.914 --> 03:36.431
and where we will be having a proper session

03:36.632 --> 03:39.093
also for marriages and all that.

03:39.294 --> 03:42.477
We will have to take a firm decision.

03:42.678 --> 03:46.889
I must speak about it today,

03:47.143 --> 03:52.459
that the steadiness of the mind is very important for the marriages.

03:52.674 --> 03:57.168
If you have certain concepts

03:57.794 --> 04:03.582
and if you are whimsical, it's better you don't get married,

04:04.764 --> 04:07.566
because that's not found in Indian character,

04:07.761 --> 04:11.499
once they decide for marriage they are married forever.

04:11.798 --> 04:15.449
But if the mind is still wavering, going up and down,

04:15.650 --> 04:17.726
it's a trick of the mind

04:17.927 --> 04:21.466
that wants to play tricks with others

04:21.667 --> 04:25.428
and enjoys, it is a sign of ego.

04:25.629 --> 04:28.155
Absolutely a sign of ego

04:28.356 --> 04:32.159
and then you start playing games,

04:32.360 --> 04:36.092
you enjoy it, "yes, no, yes, no".

04:36.300 --> 04:39.478
You go on enjoying those games

04:39.804 --> 04:42.137
and later on you play into it so much

04:42.338 --> 04:45.217
that your marriages can never be happy or successful.

04:45.418 --> 04:48.739
That means you are not yet matured for marriage.

04:48.940 --> 04:51.408
For marriage you are to be matured.

04:51.609 --> 04:54.562
But one of the reasons for this I find in the west is,

04:54.763 --> 04:58.193
that you have had no training at all.

04:58.407 --> 05:01.608
Parents have never told you how to behave

05:01.809 --> 05:04.811
towards your husband, towards your wife,

05:05.012 --> 05:07.450
how to make a marriage successful.

05:07.651 --> 05:10.771
That is a very important event

05:10.978 --> 05:13.562
and that we should try

05:13.763 --> 05:17.390
to establish ourselves in the marriage system.

05:17.591 --> 05:24.708
Instead of that, we use it as a nice trick playing ground,

05:25.081 --> 05:28.864
we miss the point, who is the loser?

05:29.348 --> 05:32.851
If you go on playing tricks like this

05:33.271 --> 05:35.975
and playing with your ego, whatever you may do,

05:36.176 --> 05:40.957
whatever you may do, whatever type of marriages you'll have,

05:41.703 --> 05:43.718
you can never be happy.

05:43.919 --> 05:47.735
Now in the west, as you know, I lead another life also

05:47.949 --> 05:50.572
and every person I have met,

05:50.810 --> 05:53.493
every person whatever country they may come,

05:53.694 --> 05:58.012
nobody seems to be happy in their marriage, is very surprising.

05:58.358 --> 06:02.875
It seems every wife finds something wrong with the husband,

06:03.121 --> 06:05.633
the husband finds something wrong with the wife

06:05.833 --> 06:09.126
and they have funny miserable faces.

06:09.327 --> 06:14.333
They don't look like married people, but as if like criminals,

06:14.831 --> 06:17.161
or something has really gone wrong with them.

06:17.362 --> 06:20.742
There's no smile on their face, they look horrid,

06:20.943 --> 06:24.008
because they have missed the point.

06:24.325 --> 06:27.915
Marriage is to be enjoyed, is for your enjoyment.

06:28.116 --> 06:33.727
Supposing one gives you ambrose...,

06:34.011 --> 06:37.821
ambrosia. "Amrut", as they call it

06:39.207 --> 06:41.980
and then you start playing trick with it.

06:42.181 --> 06:44.688
Who is the loser?

06:45.736 --> 06:51.406
So must know that we have to achieved that maturity

06:53.054 --> 06:54.967
and enjoy that love.

06:55.168 --> 06:57.788
Basically if something is very wrong,

06:58.072 --> 07:03.590
or if there's no possibility of a proper marriage,

07:03.791 --> 07:07.686
in Sahaja Yoga we have arrangement, to give it up.

07:08.205 --> 07:11.921
You can change your wife, change your husband, no problem.

07:12.122 --> 07:14.457
But there must be some reason behind it,

07:14.658 --> 07:20.474
just for fun's sake, if you want to spoil your life.

07:20.839 --> 07:22.875
I'll try my level best to tell you

07:23.076 --> 07:26.319
that don't spoil your life and of the other person.

07:26.520 --> 07:31.155
But people enjoy sometimes, spoiling somebody lives

07:31.356 --> 07:33.525
when it comes to the ego part.

07:33.726 --> 07:37.314
They themselves cannot enjoy. "Dog in the manger" policy.

07:37.515 --> 07:40.714
Dog in the manger cannot eat the grass,

07:40.915 --> 07:44.879
but barks at any bull that comes to eat it, it's like this.

07:45.110 --> 07:49.993
Neither they will enjoy, nor they will allow others to enjoy.

07:50.194 --> 07:53.686
And when such stupid couples are there,

07:53.887 --> 07:56.683
I have such a headache all the time, reconciling them,

07:56.884 --> 07:58.684
talking to them, asking them.

07:58.885 --> 08:03.245
I mean it becomes a marriage bureau for me.

08:03.446 --> 08:06.019
And sometimes I reach such a conclusion:

08:06.220 --> 08:09.823
no more marriages in Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it!

08:10.024 --> 08:12.093
Actually what have I to gain out of it.

08:12.294 --> 08:14.064
This is nobody will try to understand.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.454
What I am trying is to make you happy,

08:16.655 --> 08:18.724
to get you good husbands and good wives,

08:18.941 --> 08:21.655
that you should have good relationships,

08:21.856 --> 08:25.150
you should have great people on this Earth, to be born,

08:25.351 --> 08:28.021
that we should have a society

08:28.222 --> 08:32.188
which is beyond all these nonsensical societies,

08:32.389 --> 08:37.233
which is so great that we can create a homogenous family

08:37.434 --> 08:41.371
among ourselves of purity and of holiness.

08:41.572 --> 08:44.741
Instead of that, for petty nonsensical things

08:44.942 --> 08:48.788
if there's a fight going on, one gets really fed up.

08:49.003 --> 08:52.910
Of course one has to try.

08:53.547 --> 08:56.555
But if you are bent upon cutting your noses,

08:56.756 --> 09:01.359
how can I go on clipping them back?

09:01.896 --> 09:07.348
It's an eternal problem, if you marry your say, 75 people,

09:07.549 --> 09:09.555
you have the enjoyment of it.

09:09.756 --> 09:17.851
Now if it's a, say, a ocean of, Indian Ocean say for example.

09:18.431 --> 09:23.051
But then you get the Pacific Ocean back on your head

09:23.260 --> 09:29.211
with all the cries and weeping and shouting and screaming

09:29.412 --> 09:33.238
and all sorts of nonsense that's going on.

09:34.475 --> 09:37.843
So I again say that, now we are going to Pune

09:38.044 --> 09:41.876
where all the marriages are going to be confirmed.

09:42.106 --> 09:44.913
If you go on like this there's no end to it,

09:45.113 --> 09:50.097
also those people who come for marriages and deny it twice,

09:50.298 --> 09:52.701
third time I don't ask them,

09:52.902 --> 09:57.116
because it's a joke going on.

09:59.043 --> 10:03.745
You do not know how many nights I have spent selecting people,

10:03.968 --> 10:07.507
as it is you are from twenty five, thirty countries.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.711
Yesterday you saw that.

10:09.912 --> 10:12.799
You have different conditionings,

10:13.000 --> 10:16.005
different styles, different everything,

10:16.206 --> 10:19.556
heights different, ages different, faces different,

10:19.757 --> 10:22.775
aptitudes different.

10:23.489 --> 10:28.060
So combine all these things, so very difficult.

10:28.329 --> 10:31.426
Sometimes I think if you are overeducated,

10:31.627 --> 10:34.077
them better to give you a simple woman,

10:34.278 --> 10:37.111
so that your little pressure is reduced,

10:37.325 --> 10:41.819
you can share with her but if you are equally educated people,

10:42.020 --> 10:46.358
then both the heads may be...

10:51.715 --> 10:56.635
So I have to think of many things and of vibrations,

10:56.836 --> 10:59.434
but somehow or other you can defy

10:59.635 --> 11:02.434
and you try to defy it, alright doesn't matter,

11:02.635 --> 11:06.180
but who is the loser is the point.

11:06.386 --> 11:08.693
Today I had to speak to you about this,

11:08.910 --> 11:13.653
because in Sahaj we have to take the way it comes as it comes.

11:13.854 --> 11:17.683
Whatever comes in our way we should take it.

11:17.974 --> 11:20.749
We should not sort of say: I've fallen in love.

11:20.950 --> 11:25.660
There's nobody falls in love, it rises in love in Sahaja Yoga.

11:33.197 --> 11:38.022
That is some funny idea, that one must fall in love;

11:38.237 --> 11:43.625
because you see that means you must do something sinful,

11:44.023 --> 11:45.555
or something absurd.

11:45.756 --> 11:47.167
So many people have told me:

11:47.368 --> 11:49.468
"Mother, I have not fallen in love with her."

11:49.669 --> 11:55.312
How can you fall in love, you fall into some ditch, or you may fall,

11:55.837 --> 11:59.770
fall into some river or something like that.

11:59.971 --> 12:05.016
I didn't understand how do you fall in love, it's a solid stuff.

12:10.297 --> 12:16.086
So this absurd idea of falling in love has to be given up,

12:17.995 --> 12:23.344
if it means that you have felt the love,

12:23.582 --> 12:30.600
or if it means that you have the sensitivity of feeling the love,

12:30.801 --> 12:33.619
or something I can understand, I'm a little explanatory,

12:33.820 --> 12:36.089
but this falling in love business

12:36.290 --> 12:38.311
has been going on and on and on.

12:38.511 --> 12:39.904
Now I would request you

12:40.105 --> 12:45.262
that in Sahaja Yoga we cancel this terminology.

12:47.494 --> 12:54.017
So problems of marriages should not arise in Sahaja Yoga.

12:54.272 --> 12:58.260
You got chance for one month to decide for yourself

12:58.461 --> 13:00.535
and to find out for yourself.

13:00.736 --> 13:03.782
Little bit adjustments and understanding

13:03.983 --> 13:08.819
can create such a beautiful world for you.

13:09.391 --> 13:14.832
It's just waiting there, but suddenly you decide on some spot,

13:15.033 --> 13:17.630
suddenly you're alright I find,

13:17.839 --> 13:20.941
at the spur of the moment I find suddenly: "No",

13:21.142 --> 13:22.188
I say: "What's this?"

13:22.389 --> 13:24.914
The horse was going alright suddenly what has happened?

13:25.115 --> 13:26.163
it has turned round?

13:26.364 --> 13:28.939
One can understand a horse,

13:29.140 --> 13:32.388
but I can't understand human beings.

13:32.604 --> 13:37.564
So this whimsical behaviour suddenly,

13:38.834 --> 13:43.291
can be very injurious to the growth of Sahaja Yoga.

13:43.838 --> 13:47.389
Whenever I go to England there's a list of people

13:47.590 --> 13:49.416
from all over the country,

13:49.617 --> 13:53.240
this marriage has gone rotten, that has gone rotten,

13:53.441 --> 13:54.682
that has gone rotten,

13:54.883 --> 13:56.351
while I'm boasting to everyone

13:56.552 --> 13:58.393
that Sahaja Yoga marriages never fail.

13:58.594 --> 14:01.307
I know it's not true,

14:01.712 --> 14:06.430
but whatever I say is a Mantra, ultimately it becomes the truth.

14:06.631 --> 14:11.349
So time will come when no marriages will fail,

14:11.706 --> 14:15.708
but you have to join hands with me and co-operate

14:15.909 --> 14:19.863
and should understand, how much I have worked hard

14:20.064 --> 14:23.914
to bring about these events.

14:25.132 --> 14:28.301
And marriages should not make you happy or unhappy,

14:28.502 --> 14:33.148
because to marry is not the ultimate in life.

14:33.680 --> 14:36.787
But it happens after marriage people get lost,

14:36.988 --> 14:38.516
they don't come to Sahaja Yoga,

14:38.717 --> 14:43.518
after that, we are enjoying our honeymoon for the last three years.

14:43.812 --> 14:47.592
Wonderful Sahaja Yogis who are leaders suddenly get lost.

14:47.793 --> 14:51.311
That also may be a fall in love maybe, I don't know,

14:51.512 --> 14:55.457
but this kind of nonsense, even if it is one or two

14:55.658 --> 14:58.403
its such a headache.

15:01.527 --> 15:05.438
And I really don't know how to solve these problems,

15:05.639 --> 15:08.812
because I think there's no problem at all.

15:09.013 --> 15:12.980
Only thing you have decided not to enjoy anything.

15:14.712 --> 15:17.597
Supposing you don't want to enjoy the food,

15:17.798 --> 15:20.286
you can put some quinine on your tongue

15:20.487 --> 15:21.998
and then say I don't like the food,

15:22.199 --> 15:26.296
something like that. It's absurd.

15:26.496 --> 15:28.799
So try to help me in this,

15:29.000 --> 15:32.348
otherwise I'll give up this marriage business I tell you

15:32.548 --> 15:34.880
because it doesn't give me any joy or pleasure.

15:35.087 --> 15:40.360
Even one person plays like that I just don't understand.

15:42.674 --> 15:46.824
And for no rhyme and reason you should not say 'no'.

15:47.157 --> 15:50.836
First of all your must look at yourself in the mirror.

15:51.898 --> 15:54.171
What are you?

15:54.441 --> 15:57.802
What is your education? What is your intellect?

15:58.064 --> 16:00.788
What do you expect from another person?

16:01.106 --> 16:02.419
How much money you have got?

16:02.620 --> 16:04.180
How much money the other person has got?

16:04.381 --> 16:08.559
Whatever you want to see, you can see for yourself, to begin with,

16:08.760 --> 16:11.320
then compare.

16:11.737 --> 16:13.697
But the greatest thing you have to think about,

16:13.898 --> 16:18.265
how many vibrations you have?

16:20.699 --> 16:23.153
How much Sahaja Yoga the other one knows?

16:23.354 --> 16:25.847
You are married for your ascent.

16:26.048 --> 16:32.717
If the other person has vibrations much more than yours,

16:32.918 --> 16:38.685
then your should not unnecessarily boast of nonsensical gross things.

16:38.886 --> 16:43.484
The person is much subtler, make use of that.

16:44.357 --> 16:48.417
Whether it's a woman or a man I don't say,

16:48.937 --> 16:52.147
but I just say that see for yourself," where are you?"

16:52.348 --> 16:55.789
Specially for beginners who are beginning to take to Sahaja Yoga,

16:55.990 --> 16:58.412
is better to marry some mature Sahaja Yogi

16:58.613 --> 17:02.220
so that they can ascend very well, much faster.

17:02.854 --> 17:06.524
And also if the other party is not so good, maybe,

17:06.725 --> 17:10.281
we have to work, we have to save that person,

17:10.482 --> 17:15.606
after all, they are not yet matured but they are Sahaja Yogis,

17:15.884 --> 17:21.103
they want to do, so try to work it out in that way.

17:22.342 --> 17:25.075
I think you will understand the seriousness,

17:25.276 --> 17:27.656
this is the most important work

17:27.857 --> 17:32.505
that ever happened on this Earth so far.

17:32.759 --> 17:35.418
Your marriages are very important

17:35.619 --> 17:37.392
and you have seen the photographs

17:37.593 --> 17:40.946
with the Gods themselves have blessed you.

17:41.147 --> 17:44.413
Because of my consent, because of my selection,

17:44.614 --> 17:46.788
they all were present in your marriage

17:46.989 --> 17:50.537
and how they were giving you tributes

17:50.738 --> 17:55.287
and how they were putting flowers on the brides.

17:55.488 --> 17:59.509
You have seen the photographs. If you have not seen I will show you.

18:00.040 --> 18:02.061
But if you are not a seeker,

18:02.262 --> 18:04.553
and if you are not seeking your higher ascent,

18:04.754 --> 18:08.249
then you go into nonsensical things and nonsensical ideas.

18:08.450 --> 18:11.967
So better be careful not to do such a thing,

18:12.178 --> 18:14.272
don't think too much of yourself.

18:14.473 --> 18:16.947
Another note of caution,

18:17.148 --> 18:22.301
that you see the way Indians pamper their son-in-laws,

18:22.502 --> 18:25.012
so don't get mad.

18:25.250 --> 18:28.711
Also they pamper their daughter-in-laws very much.

18:28.912 --> 18:32.239
It's done in India to create better relationships,

18:32.440 --> 18:35.267
because we don't have the balloon of ego so much here.

18:35.468 --> 18:41.068
But here as soon as somebody pays attention to you, you go off,

18:41.385 --> 18:43.254
so better be careful.

18:43.472 --> 18:46.298
It's a custom here to look after the son-in-law,

18:46.499 --> 18:49.904
to look after the daughter, there is a custom.

18:50.147 --> 18:53.084
Now it is ingrained from ages,

18:53.285 --> 18:55.676
it doesn't mean that you are God,

18:55.877 --> 18:59.714
or you are in some superlative condition.

19:00.717 --> 19:04.695
It's just that, that is how they pamper,

19:04.896 --> 19:07.163
they look after the daughter-in-law,

19:07.364 --> 19:10.736
or the son-in-law, normally.

19:11.077 --> 19:14.951
And you should not carry away ideas,

19:15.169 --> 19:18.013
which I must tell you because it doesn't happen in the west,

19:18.214 --> 19:19.563
I have seen, they don't care.

19:19.764 --> 19:23.143
Once that they are married, they are finished, it's not so,

19:23.344 --> 19:24.642
so please be careful.

19:24.843 --> 19:26.212
When you are marrying Indians,

19:26.413 --> 19:30.666
you will find the parents will quite pamper you, look after you,

19:30.867 --> 19:34.351
they'll call you to their house, do this, give you money,

19:34.552 --> 19:38.993
give you ornaments, all kinds of things they'll do.

19:39.517 --> 19:45.048
But still one has to understand that is just a custom

19:45.755 --> 19:47.173
and should not get pampered,

19:47.374 --> 19:49.879
on the contrary should feel blissful about it.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.685
But when it is done I have seen suddenly they go off

19:53.886 --> 19:55.796
and they think no end of themselves,

19:55.997 --> 19:58.895
their value system goes off.

19:59.096 --> 20:02.789
It's because, so far we have had no education,

20:02.990 --> 20:06.545
no training about marriages.

20:06.746 --> 20:10.001
I am sorry I have to say this in the presence of many Indians.

20:10.213 --> 20:13.729
But indians also you see, expect you to understand

20:13.929 --> 20:15.598
their customs sometimes too much.

20:15.813 --> 20:18.361
For example yesterday the garlands were given

20:18.562 --> 20:20.489
at the time when the garlands were given,

20:20.689 --> 20:23.970
you are not supposed to garland yourself,

20:24.232 --> 20:27.131
but some of you took the garland put it in you. 

20:27.332 --> 20:31.034
They regarded it as absolutely unmannerly,

20:31.269 --> 20:32.798
but it is so.

20:32.999 --> 20:37.160
So when we are in India we have to understand Indians,

20:37.343 --> 20:40.839
but when we are in the west we have to understand the western people.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.556
For example in the west you just go on saying,

20:43.757 --> 20:47.152
thank, thank you, sorry, sorry sorry, sorry sorry sorry.

20:47.550 --> 20:49.903
It is so confusing sometimes.

20:50.104 --> 20:53.193
We have to go on shaking hands with so many people,

20:53.394 --> 20:57.237
I mean, I sometimes shake hands with nine hundred people at a time.

20:57.484 --> 21:01.071
And while they are going back again nine hundred people.

21:01.662 --> 21:03.991
I think namaste is a better idea,

21:04.192 --> 21:07.151
than to shake hands with every sort of a person,

21:07.352 --> 21:10.966
you'll catch from every one. But it's a custom,

21:11.167 --> 21:14.170
it's custom so we have to understand this is a custom

21:14.370 --> 21:18.975
and which is not to be resented, is not such a bad custom.

21:19.404 --> 21:23.731
There's nothing wrong in it and maybe there is no logic.

21:23.932 --> 21:26.585
For example garlanding yourself there is little logic,

21:26.786 --> 21:30.404
you don't garland yourself, somebody else has to garland

21:30.668 --> 21:33.832
and the ladies don't take garlands on their...,

21:34.033 --> 21:36.816
you see because any man cannot garland a lady,

21:37.017 --> 21:39.516
because it's only husband has the right,

21:39.717 --> 21:42.115
see, so anyone won't garland.

21:42.316 --> 21:45.254
Or a son can garland the mother,

21:45.552 --> 21:48.531
but any man cannot garland any lady

21:48.732 --> 21:50.635
who is of a younger age,

21:50.836 --> 21:54.456
or who is not yet married and even if married,

21:54.657 --> 21:58.204
she has to be an old woman like me, then it's alright.

21:58.486 --> 22:02.417
So these are customs very much ingrained and it's best or logic

22:02.618 --> 22:06.726
that you cannot garland yourself and walk on the street.

22:07.307 --> 22:11.821
Even if the leaders here are garlanded

22:12.022 --> 22:15.025
immediately they take out their garland, except for the Gods,

22:15.226 --> 22:19.577
I mean I can carry with my garland but I also take it out.

22:21.817 --> 22:24.947
So these are few customs which must be understood

22:25.148 --> 22:27.744
and there's nothing wrong in it, there's logic.

22:27.945 --> 22:30.899
Whatever is illogical we can give up,

22:31.100 --> 22:34.785
whatever is logical we have to take it and understand it.

22:35.016 --> 22:37.670
So I am just telling you, that yesterday they started laughing,

22:37.878 --> 22:39.821
children also started laughing, because they thought

22:40.022 --> 22:42.473
they are garlanding themselves.

22:42.674 --> 22:47.339
It's like doing aarti to yourself, you know,

22:47.868 --> 22:50.024
amounts to that.

22:50.365 --> 22:53.494
So you can understand why they were laughing.

22:53.695 --> 22:58.594
They didn't mean to hurt you in any way, but this is the system.

22:59.414 --> 23:03.284
Now coming to Sahaja Yoga,

23:03.498 --> 23:07.112
yesterday was Left Vishuddhi was too much.

23:07.597 --> 23:10.363
Perhaps maybe in the morning I said you were allready late

23:10.564 --> 23:13.840
for the formal programme, I don't know.

23:14.041 --> 23:17.727
Whatever I say has to be just listened to, that's all.

23:17.928 --> 23:20.355
Only thing is next time we should not be late,

23:20.556 --> 23:22.235
in any formal programme.

23:22.436 --> 23:27.076
But it seems such a Left Vishuddhi was there that I got a lump here

23:27.277 --> 23:29.339
and I just knew what it was.

23:29.563 --> 23:31.942
So Mother says to you things

23:32.143 --> 23:34.193
which should not hurt you in any way

23:34.394 --> 23:36.524
and you should not take it that seriously

23:36.725 --> 23:39.349
but should understand that next time we should not do so,

23:39.550 --> 23:43.009
otherwise you are all wonderful people, you are beautiful people.

23:43.303 --> 23:45.225
I love you, I adore you, not only that,

23:45.401 --> 23:47.244
but I am very proud of you.

23:47.445 --> 23:49.185
I'm extremely proud of you,

23:49.386 --> 23:51.569
but I have to tell you something sometimes.

23:51.770 --> 23:55.589
But if I tell you even wee bit then if you, get that upset,

23:55.790 --> 23:59.182
I don't know what should I do.

23:59.610 --> 24:02.983
So not to take things that seriously.

24:03.717 --> 24:07.199
There's nothing so much wrong.

24:07.437 --> 24:10.564
In general I have to tell you things which you should understand

24:10.765 --> 24:13.256
it's for our good, for our enjoyment.

24:13.457 --> 24:16.082
Everything to increase your enjoyment.

24:16.350 --> 24:20.390
Even your ascent in Sahaja Yoga is to increase your enjoyment,

24:20.591 --> 24:25.145
your sensitivity to joy to increase it more and more,

24:25.463 --> 24:28.286
all this is done.

24:28.487 --> 24:33.257
