1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,694
And the time has come. This is the time.

2
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:14,433
The time.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,400
It is all mentioned thousands of years back.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,400
If you heard about the Bhrighumuni

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,527
there is written a complete book called as Nadi Granth

6
00:00:23,647 --> 00:00:26,776
about these times everything described, Sahaja Yoga, everything.

7
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:30,760
Even, hundred years back I would say,

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,000
William Blake has described everything about Sahaja Yoga, everything!

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,760
But people called him crazy.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:43,189
They liked people like Byron, all imaginary people.

11
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,520


12
00:01:01,347 --> 00:01:05,075
I don't know what to call myself. It's very difficult. (Laughter)

13
00:01:05,195 --> 00:01:06,800
You know what mysticism is.

14
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,880
I know. You can call Me everything I think

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,520
It is quite an integration of so many things I have.

16
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,539
But I would like to call myself as the Mother.

17
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:22,800
That's the sweetest and the best I think.

18
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,323
Because I am very patient,

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,352
perhaps and extremely forgiving.

20
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,447


21
00:01:41,697 --> 00:01:47,150
It is a rebirth, a rebirth.

22
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,542
And the birth is given by the Mother only.

23
00:01:50,662 --> 00:01:53,190
Father can't give the birth.

24
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:04,769
It is an immaculate rebirth.

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:13,080


26
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,880
No I don't tell anything like that for that before that.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,405
But you give up yourself. I don't say this.

28
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:22,446
You just give up yourself.

29
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:26,293
Whatever is not good for you, just give up. Because you become joy.

30
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:30,949
You start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost that gives you vibrations

31
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:32,800
and you don't want to do anything like that.

32
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,080
Now for example, if you ask Me to take to drugs, I will not.

33
00:02:36,246 --> 00:02:37,886
I mean I'm never tempted

34
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:40,200
for alcohol or anything. I'm never tempted to anything.

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,480
I just don't get tempted to anything.

36
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,040
You just don't do it yourself

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,270
because if you are the spirit, you are so detached.

38
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,440
If you become the spirit, you become the glory of the spirit.

39
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,960
You have the powers of the spirit.

40
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,400
You become such a great personality yourself.

41
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:58,287
You just don't do it.

42
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:01,373
I don't have to tell you.

43
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,269
I don't force anything whatsoever.

44
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,900
You become yourself. That only.

45
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,700
When you become yourself you are great, no doubt about it.

46
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,060
It is a very revolutionary time we are.

47
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,969
Very revolutionary. You should see the signs of the revolution.

48
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:23,280
We never had so many seekers.

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,720
We never had so many confusions. So many problems.

50
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,261
And in that confusion only,

51
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:37,422
the lotus of your spirit is going to shine.
