00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:16.440
So the brain is controlled through the Spirit.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.760
How?

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:29.960
That around the heart there are seven auras

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.200
which can be multiplied into any number,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.840
seven raised to power sixteen hundred,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:56.480
which are the ones which watch the seven chakras,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:04.120
raised to power sixteen hundred - sixteen thousand, sorry.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:14.480
Now this Spirit is watching through this aura.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.680
Watching, I am again saying "watching"

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.000
through this aura.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.680
This aura is watching

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.320
the behavior of your seven centers in your brain.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.760
Is also watching all the nerves

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.440
that are working in the brain

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.400
"watching", again.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:14.120
But when you bring the Spirit into your brain,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.360
then you go two steps ahead,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.280
because when your Kundalini rises,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.080
She touches the Sadashiva

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.520
and Sadashiva informs the Spirit.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.520
Informs in the sense - reflects in the Spirit.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:48.600
So that's the first state where the watching auras

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.320
start communicating

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.120
through your different chakras

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.280
in the brain

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.640
and integrating it.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.560
But when you bring your Spirit to your brain

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.400
this is the second state.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.880
Then you really become self-realized,

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.640
in the full way,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.200
in the full way,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.160
because then your Self, that is the Spirit,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.280
becomes your brain.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.280
Action is very dynamic, it opens then,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.480
the fifth dimension in the human being.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.280
First when your become realized, collectively conscious,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.120
and start raising the Kundalini,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.640
you are in, you cross the fourth dimension.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.320
But when your Spirit comes into your brain,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.640
then you become the fifth dimension

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.520
means, you become the doer.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.520
Our brain, now, for example says, "All right,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.560
lift this thing up." So you touch it with your hand,

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.960
you lift it up. You are the doer.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.360
But when the brain becomes the Spirit,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.080
the Spirit is the doer,

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.400
and when Spirit is the doer,

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:52.240
then you become a complete Shiva - self-realized.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.920
In that state,

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:05.040
if you get angry, you are not attached.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.360
You are not an attached person to anything whatsoever.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.200
If you possess anything, you are not attached.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.520
You cannot attach, because Spirit is detachment,

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.440
complete detachment.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:27.720
You don't bother about any attachments whatsoever.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.320
Even for a second, you are not attached.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.040
Now I would say,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.560
to understand the detachment of Spirit,

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.080
we should study ourselves very well, clearly.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.040
How are we attached?

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.680
We are attached, firstly, by our brain,

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.120
mostly by our brain,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.560
because all our conditionings are in our brain

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.800
and all our ego is also in our brain.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.880
So all emotional attachments

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.400
are through our brain

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.560
and all our egoistical attachments also are through our brain.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.800
That's why it is said that after Realization one must try

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.880
to practice the Shiva Tattwa

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.360
by practicing detachment.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.440
Now how do you practice this detachment?

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.360
In the practice of Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.600
if you have to rise higher

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.520
you have to improve your own instrument

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.400
and not the instrument of others.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.720
This is one thing one should know, for definite.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.120
Now, you just watch your attention. Where is it going.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.480
Watch yourself.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.400
As soon as you'll start watching yourself, your attention,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.880
you'll become more identified with your Spirit.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.160
Because if you have to watch your attention,

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.400
you will have to be your Spirit, otherwise how will you watch it?

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.680
So now see where is your attention going.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:48.160
First, the attachment is, in all gross ways, to your body.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:56.960
So we see Shiva - there's no attachment to His body.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.640
He sleeps anywhere.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.960
He goes to the cemeteries and sleeps there,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.080
because He's not attached.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.920
He can never be caught up by any bhoots or anything,

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.240
nothing of the kind. He is detached.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.440
The detachment is to be watched

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:31.000
and seen through your own attachments.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.680
Now, because you are realized souls,

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.040
not yet the Spirit, has not come into your brain of course,

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.480
but still you are realized souls.

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.880
So what you can do is

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.440
at least to watch your attention, you can do that.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:57.640
You can watch your attention very clearly

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:04.040
by seeing where your attention is going.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:10.600
And then, controlling your attention, also, you can do.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.000
Very simple.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.360
To control your attention you have to just

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.880
remove your attention from this to that.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.400
Try to change your priorities,

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.080
all this has to be done now,

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.000
after Realization - a complete detachment.
