00:00:39.893 --> 00:00:43.557
I’ll try to cover most of the
points that you have asked but

00:00:43.758 --> 00:00:47.198
I must say that I was very happy to
hear most of the questions because

00:00:47.398 --> 00:00:52.612
that shows that your enquiry
is getting subtler and subtler;

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:57.790
that you already know
about the gross side of chakras

00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:03.233
and now you want to know the subtler forms.

00:01:04.972 --> 00:01:11.105
Now the first question
which should be taken up first,

00:01:11.306 --> 00:01:16.563
is the one, “How the
chakras come into human beings?

00:01:16.763 --> 00:01:19.409
What time? What stage of life?”

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.933
because that should be the first question.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.936
This question is something like if we ask,

00:01:30.137 --> 00:01:36.333
“What time a primule comes into the
being of a seed?” is something like that.

00:01:36.636 --> 00:01:40.223
That a human being when he dies –

00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:44.071
as I have told you before he does not die fully

00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:51.667
– only a part of him dies which
is mostly the earth element

00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:56.067
and the rest of the elements remain there.

00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:05.867
The rest of the body disappears

00:02:06.943 --> 00:02:13.000
and we can’t see it because it
is not a complete human form.

00:02:13.284 --> 00:02:16.410
It goes on decreasing in size

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.830
and the Kundalini leaves the body

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:32.817
and stays outside, outside the body.

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:40.903
And the Atma, what we call the Spirit,

00:02:41.104 --> 00:02:47.862
also leaves the body, and stays outside
the body, which is the remaining body.

00:02:51.148 --> 00:02:55.663
The constitution of this new body is different
from our constitution.

00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:03.784
We can say a light that is extinguished

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.027
has all the body except for the light.

00:03:08.874 --> 00:03:12.779
But the light goes out of that body now.

00:03:13.842 --> 00:03:19.227
In the same way, in a human being who dies,

00:03:19.428 --> 00:03:23.150
the Spirit and the Kundalini leave the body,

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.354
but they are around that body.

00:03:30.425 --> 00:03:36.483
And it’s a great procedure
that follows which is fantastic.

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:43.580
It’s unbelievable how the body
disappears, into different elements also.

00:03:44.802 --> 00:03:49.883
But first of all let us see; when
such bodies which remain like that,

00:03:50.084 --> 00:03:56.850
they go into what you call the Pretalok.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.208
There they become seeds or they
become smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:13.444
Till one body forms an ova and a -

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.850
what you know as a sperm.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.102
In one body it is formed.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.434
I don’t know if you have seen the
division of chromosomes how it takes place?

00:04:26.635 --> 00:04:29.213
It’s a complete division.

00:04:29.414 --> 00:04:32.939
If the chromosome is like that,
it’s a complete vertical division

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.429
and a complete separation takes place.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.898
That is why marriages

00:04:43.827 --> 00:04:49.646
and selection of partners,

00:04:50.071 --> 00:04:53.301
all these have a great place.

00:04:54.135 --> 00:04:59.283
For ordinary bodies it does
not matter for the Divine;

00:05:00.598 --> 00:05:08.150
they take place in such a manner that there
can be at random connections established.

00:05:08.881 --> 00:05:14.505
For example an ova of one may combine

00:05:14.706 --> 00:05:19.650
with the sperm of another.

00:05:20.243 --> 00:05:24.141
It happens at a very lower stage of evolution;

00:05:24.342 --> 00:05:26.998
among human beings also it happens like that.

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:34.865
For some people who are
just not very evolved, we can say.

00:05:36.583 --> 00:05:43.017
But mostly the ova rejects the sperms.

00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:49.383
It only except that sperm
which is meant to be accepted.

00:05:50.168 --> 00:05:56.495
Now it is such a minute work. It is
so fantastic that it is unbelievable.

00:05:56.696 --> 00:05:59.968
We have no idea as to how God works out in those.

00:06:00.203 --> 00:06:04.550
It’s absolutely tremendous that even the ova,

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.083
rejects, goes on rejecting the sperm

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.697
that is not the second part of itself!

00:06:16.898 --> 00:06:21.895
And that’s how so many sperms are
wasted and so many ova’s are wasted.

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:28.415
So you can imagine that there is a tremendous
machinery, which is working out this.

00:06:29.471 --> 00:06:34.117
Specially people who are
realised if, when they are reborn,

00:06:35.253 --> 00:06:40.783
all the forces of the Divine
combine to see that these,

00:06:41.078 --> 00:06:45.851
this ova is placed with a person

00:06:46.181 --> 00:06:50.617
who is ultimately going to meet
the person who has the proper sperm,

00:06:50.817 --> 00:06:56.486
so that there is no problem as
far as the meeting is concerned.

00:06:57.335 --> 00:07:03.374
And the Divine takes all
the care of these great souls.

00:07:09.216 --> 00:07:13.183
The work of the Divine is very, very fantastic

00:07:13.587 --> 00:07:19.503
and it is beyond human conception to
understand how the awareness of God

00:07:19.703 --> 00:07:24.355
can look after all the minute
small things of the world.

00:07:24.768 --> 00:07:28.682
You cannot do even a
small thing like attaching this

00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:32.483
to this one unless and until
you pay some human attention.

00:07:32.683 --> 00:07:35.517
So you can imagine the attention of God

00:07:35.717 --> 00:07:42.983
who embeds so many seeds in this Mother
Earth and gives you such huge, big trees.

00:07:43.183 --> 00:07:45.849
I mean, you have taken them for granted,

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:52.468
but if you watch you will see
this Fantastic, Dynamic Force behind it,

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:56.140
which thinks it, which does it so perfect.

00:07:58.621 --> 00:08:02.883
But we think that it is all automatic
and that’s how we can bear it,

00:08:03.187 --> 00:08:08.917
and that’s how we can bear Sahaj
yoga also, thinking that it is all automatic.

00:08:09.473 --> 00:08:12.460
The second question is,

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.148
“When did the chakras
then are in the body embedded?”

00:08:16.398 --> 00:08:20.173
They exist in the body and they go on existing.

00:08:20.374 --> 00:08:27.715
Of course they get corrected every time the
body takes birth and goes into a new seeking.

00:08:28.072 --> 00:08:31.050
And the Kundalini also,

00:08:31.641 --> 00:08:37.530
every birth you are born, is
watching you as to what you are doing,

00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:41.883
how your chakras are
developing, how it is working out.

00:08:42.083 --> 00:08:46.888
And through the,

00:08:49.463 --> 00:08:52.950
method of balancing you or parasympathetic system

00:08:53.303 --> 00:08:56.010
or you can call universal unconscious,

00:08:57.375 --> 00:09:04.620
the chakras are brought to its proper shape

00:09:04.821 --> 00:09:08.882
and to its proper condition by evolution.

00:09:09.083 --> 00:09:14.262
A man makes mistakes he makes searches,
he searches from one place to another.

00:09:14.463 --> 00:09:17.230
For example, he may start his search in money,

00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:21.666
then he starts his search in power

00:09:21.867 --> 00:09:24.317
then he starts his search in love,

00:09:24.737 --> 00:09:30.778
I mean the carnal love, or he may
start his search some emotional expressions,

00:09:30.979 --> 00:09:33.283
then in art and all those things:

00:09:33.483 --> 00:09:39.936
ultimately he finds that the
search has not been alright

00:09:40.136 --> 00:09:45.957
because he has not been able to
achieve any state of joyous existence.

00:09:46.422 --> 00:09:51.871
And with his search these chakras
go on evolving and understanding.

00:09:52.072 --> 00:09:59.050
Now we have to know that these
chakras are absolutely living entities.

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:06.750
Because when a person is supposed to be dead,

00:10:07.238 --> 00:10:14.134
that time, all the Deities
are not in the working state.

00:10:14.642 --> 00:10:21.350
But the living man has the chakras,

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.688
which has got the Deities, which work out,

00:10:26.526 --> 00:10:29.983
the different functions of the chakras

00:10:30.183 --> 00:10:33.150
and it’s a very, very subtle working

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:42.080
and these can be called as the reflecting mirrors

00:10:42.483 --> 00:10:48.846
at different levels of our
awareness where the Deities,

00:10:49.047 --> 00:10:53.983
which are placed in the Primordial
Being, the Viraata, are reflected

00:10:55.507 --> 00:10:59.010
and they, once awakened,

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:04.050
start working out the plans of the Divine.

00:11:07.503 --> 00:11:12.550
In some of the human beings, when
they are searching these chakras,

00:11:14.388 --> 00:11:21.959
find that the person or the subject

00:11:22.967 --> 00:11:26.417
is going to the extremes of things

00:11:26.991 --> 00:11:33.817
and this comes because a human
being has got freedom to choose.

00:11:35.091 --> 00:11:38.417
And in his freedom he goes to the extremes,

00:11:39.003 --> 00:11:42.050
and by going to the extremes

00:11:45.018 --> 00:11:50.224
the chakras get damaged.

00:11:51.145 --> 00:11:55.950
Going to the extremes is what we call is ‘sin’.

00:11:56.895 --> 00:12:03.850
To be in the centre, to lead
a moderate, simple balanced life

00:12:05.252 --> 00:12:09.827
and stick to the values

00:12:10.307 --> 00:12:15.217
of our sustenance is the best life,

00:12:15.417 --> 00:12:21.817
but if you start going to the
extremes then the sin starts.

00:12:22.337 --> 00:12:28.583
And the sin…in the Bible it is written
that, “The wages of sin is death.”

00:12:30.376 --> 00:12:34.895
So the death occurs. Now the death
actually, you know, doesn’t take place

00:12:35.095 --> 00:12:39.317
but what happens is that the
part of the chakra gets damaged.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:45.717
It can be a physical hankering, it
can be mental, it can be emotional,

00:12:45.917 --> 00:12:48.989
it can be spiritual, it can be anything.

00:12:49.346 --> 00:12:54.340
If you go on working out

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:58.217
an imbalanced solution

00:12:58.598 --> 00:13:01.650
then these chakras get spoilt at different points.

00:13:02.938 --> 00:13:05.938
That’s how your chakras get spoilt.

00:13:12.246 --> 00:13:18.650
The chakras are,

00:13:20.309 --> 00:13:25.817
according to our awareness, in different states.

00:13:26.387 --> 00:13:31.517
For example for a doctor or for all of us,

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:37.415
we know that we have plexuses in our
body, we know we have different plexuses.

00:13:37.616 --> 00:13:43.283
Like you can say pelvic
plexus, we have got solar plexus,

00:13:43.665 --> 00:13:47.683
we’ve got aortic plexus,
we have got cardiac plexus,

00:13:47.883 --> 00:13:53.483
we have got cervical plexus,
we have got optic chiasma,

00:13:53.843 --> 00:13:58.370
we’ve got limbic area to act,

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:01.852
or we can say
pituitary and pineal bodies at optic chiasma,

00:14:02.053 --> 00:14:05.879
and then we have got limbic area where
we have got certain points which are active.

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:10.483
This every doctor knows because
they have even tested the limbic area

00:14:10.683 --> 00:14:16.317
of some monkeys and they found that if
you excite the limbic area of the monkeys,

00:14:16.517 --> 00:14:19.548
they feel very joyous - with electricity,

00:14:20.391 --> 00:14:23.391
So all these chakras,

00:14:26.185 --> 00:14:32.050
in the body of a human being,
are only felt as gross expressions,

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:38.816
which we call as ‘plexuses’ in the
parasympathetic and sympathetic channels.

00:14:39.117 --> 00:14:42.324
They are all connected as I have
told you, that the sympathetic comes

00:14:42.524 --> 00:14:46.779
from both the sides and creates the central
channel, and that is the parasympathetic.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.642
So it
depends on the balance of both these sympathetics

00:14:50.842 --> 00:14:54.277
that the parasympathetic works out well.

00:14:54.478 --> 00:14:58.217
When the balance breaks up
any balance can upset both of them,

00:14:58.417 --> 00:15:02.194
and when it is completely broken
then they become on their own,

00:15:02.395 --> 00:15:09.717
and that is how it is the complete
so-called, ‘liberation’ of man from Gods grace.

00:15:09.917 --> 00:15:13.917
Once he’s completely liberated
from that thing he starts falling

00:15:14.117 --> 00:15:20.350
into the state of, as you call them rakshasas.

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:26.183
He goes to hell, he goes to the other
kind of awareness where there is no feeling,

00:15:26.383 --> 00:15:31.634
no consciousness of conscience.

00:15:31.835 --> 00:15:37.718
He doesn’t think twice. He can kill a hundred
people without even feeling bad about it.

00:15:38.196 --> 00:15:44.367
He loses all his emotional side
and also he loses all his wisdom.

00:15:44.638 --> 00:15:51.968
What remains in him is his own
ambitions and his own desires or his depravity.

00:15:52.169 --> 00:15:56.696
And he goes on without feeling any compunction

00:15:56.896 --> 00:16:04.879
or any binding from the Divine or his own dharma.

00:16:06.655 --> 00:16:12.215
So these chakras are very
important for us because, first of all,

00:16:12.416 --> 00:16:18.683
they give us the balance
for our everyday existence.

00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:24.383
They give us… (break in recording)…God,

00:16:24.584 --> 00:16:28.005
and we can think of subtle
things and abstract things.

00:16:28.206 --> 00:16:32.886
This all comes through the help of the chakras.

00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:38.897
If you ask Me if the animals
have the chakras – they have.

00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:43.255
But they don’t have all of them separated,
sometimes they are confused chakras

00:16:43.456 --> 00:16:50.666
and all the chakras are not separated from
each other and they are not all opened out

00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:59.827
because of their evolutionary
process is not yet complete.

00:17:00.027 --> 00:17:04.450
But some animals I have seen
have got an awakened Kundalini

00:17:04.651 --> 00:17:07.485
and they are realised animals I have seen it.

00:17:07.686 --> 00:17:12.855
So it is possible, even for animals,
to be very dharmic than men are.

00:17:13.055 --> 00:17:18.463
And sometimes it’s surprising how they can
discriminate better than human beings can.

00:17:18.726 --> 00:17:24.600
Apart from that animals, are
kept under the bondage of God

00:17:24.801 --> 00:17:31.264
and whatever their sustenance is done
by them; they don’t have to think about it.

00:17:31.464 --> 00:17:37.882
For example a dog is a dog,
a cat is a cat, and a tiger is a tiger.

00:17:38.083 --> 00:17:44.800
It’s only the human beings can be a dog, can
be a scorpion, can be a snake and can be a saint.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.805
So it’s only a possibility in the human being

00:17:48.005 --> 00:17:51.067
that you can find all the
animals existing side by side,

00:17:51.267 --> 00:17:54.433
and can be any time these animals can come out

00:17:54.633 --> 00:18:01.498
and you may be surprised at yourself the way
they suddenly jump out and start barking at you!

00:18:02.617 --> 00:18:06.977
So that is what human beings are because
whatever has been in our past is within us;

00:18:07.177 --> 00:18:11.400
whatever animals we have been
is within us, so all that is there.

00:18:11.645 --> 00:18:15.133
But whatever we are going to be also is there.

00:18:16.396 --> 00:18:19.933
And whatever we are
going to achieve is also there.

00:18:20.618 --> 00:18:25.367
For human beings the future, past,
present exists, but for God it does not.

00:18:25.786 --> 00:18:29.115
So for Him to plan and to organise
and arrange is a very easy stuff

00:18:29.315 --> 00:18:34.100
because if you do not have such demarcating
things you just organise things much better.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.733
And His methods are because of His own,

00:18:39.062 --> 00:18:44.438
I should say awareness,
status, almightiness, I can say

00:18:44.638 --> 00:18:50.409
or it’s just His nature that He’s like
that, that He can manage things very well.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:53.645
And you cannot explain them
with one event after another event,

00:18:53.845 --> 00:18:56.504
how He has managed and how it has happened.

00:18:56.705 --> 00:19:02.667
He does it just because He is
capable of doing that, you see.

00:19:02.988 --> 00:19:07.031
He need not do it, all that, with understanding

00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:11.250
or thinking about it as human beings
do because he does not have to think either

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.537
because He is that, you see.

00:19:13.738 --> 00:19:17.402
He is the power and He does
everything. He is the consciousness,

00:19:17.602 --> 00:19:20.545
so he does everything
without putting any effort into it.

00:19:20.746 --> 00:19:25.600
And is a very different state, which perhaps
you can understand, as Sahaja Yogis, that,

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.148
just you move your hands and you
find the Kundalini moving the other side!

00:19:29.349 --> 00:19:32.700
And you may say, “Why is it moving?”
after all, you must think about it.

00:19:32.901 --> 00:19:36.267
You are realised so you can do it
but not a person who is not realised;

00:19:36.467 --> 00:19:40.967
if he put’s hand like that a hundred times nothing is
going to work out. Only you can raise the Kundalini.

00:19:41.167 --> 00:19:44.797
The reason is: your awareness is
different and his awareness is the different;

00:19:44.997 --> 00:19:48.422
your powers are different
and his powers are different.

00:19:48.623 --> 00:19:52.000
So, in the same way God who is All Powerful,

00:19:52.618 --> 00:19:57.710
for Him even moving His finger He can
move the whole Universe, after all He is God.

00:19:57.911 --> 00:20:01.400
And that’s why for human beings it is
said that you better have faith in God

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.995
because that’s the
best way you can solve your problem.

00:20:04.196 --> 00:20:06.868
If you go on thinking
about Him you’ll all go crazy!

00:20:07.069 --> 00:20:12.683
So we have to go to a point where we can understand
Him otherwise we will all go crazy understanding Him

00:20:12.883 --> 00:20:19.375
and we all will become mad thinking, “What
all these things! It’s beyond us, it is too much!”

00:20:22.993 --> 00:20:28.383
But because in Sahaja Yoga now your awareness
has come really to such subtler forms,

00:20:28.583 --> 00:20:32.083
one can understand so many things

00:20:32.527 --> 00:20:37.850
and can understand the subtler ways of God’s doing

00:20:38.563 --> 00:20:41.757
and also understand what -

00:20:43.237 --> 00:20:46.650
is possible for you through subtle methods.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:49.306
We can talk on subtler things but

00:20:49.506 --> 00:20:53.583
talking this to anybody who is not a
Sahaja Yogi would be something madness!

00:20:53.783 --> 00:20:59.378
They wouldn’t understand a word that I’m saying.
It’s only meant for the people who are Sahaja Yogis.

00:21:01.098 --> 00:21:03.831
So we came to a point where I said that,

00:21:04.031 --> 00:21:08.750
“In the gross they are expressed
as plexuses in the human being.”

00:21:09.367 --> 00:21:13.367
Now this is known as the gross way.
Now the subtle form you have seen,

00:21:13.568 --> 00:21:19.240
the sukshma as they call it – the subtle
form. The subtle form exists in the human being,

00:21:19.628 --> 00:21:26.235
which you can see – you have seen it – the subtle form as
energy when it starts pulsating, you have seen the pulsation.

00:21:26.752 --> 00:21:29.617
But this subtle form is,

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:34.483
in two forms you
can say, one is a sukshma and ati sukshma.

00:21:35.021 --> 00:21:39.950
Because in the sukshma
you can see and a person who

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:51.583
is a realised soul,

00:21:51.783 --> 00:21:55.445
if you are a realised soul

00:21:55.687 --> 00:22:02.417
then you see even the chakras,

00:22:02.617 --> 00:22:06.535
in the sense you can feel
the chakras on your fingers.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:13.690
A unrealised soul can see
the pulsation of the Kundalini

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:17.900
and the different chakras
with his own eyes, he can,

00:22:18.381 --> 00:22:22.746
if he watches it clearly he can
see the different chakras clearly.

00:22:23.047 --> 00:22:27.317
And you as Sahaja Yogis
can feel them on your fingers

00:22:27.517 --> 00:22:31.617
and also can feel them within
yourself in the collective consciousness.

00:22:35.221 --> 00:22:40.550
There is, you can say, in
the second stage of sukshma,

00:22:42.242 --> 00:22:49.083
there are three stages as you can say:
sukshma, sukshmatara and sukshmatam.

00:22:49.368 --> 00:22:54.946
These three things you can see. The
first stage you see is on your fingers,

00:22:57.652 --> 00:23:03.717
is the sukshmatara you can say,
but with the eyes you see is a sukshma

00:23:04.123 --> 00:23:09.317
and if your fingers or on your
chakras when you feel it is,

00:23:09.988 --> 00:23:12.317
you can say, sukshmatam.

00:23:12.517 --> 00:23:15.405
So you see them in three forms.

00:23:15.643 --> 00:23:20.650
If some of the people
do not feel it on the fingers

00:23:20.972 --> 00:23:23.382
can feel it on the chakras also.

00:23:23.583 --> 00:23:28.750
So you can feel it in three
ways but there’s a fourth way

00:23:30.307 --> 00:23:35.133
where you can say it is in
the karana, karana state,

00:23:35.514 --> 00:23:41.400
that’s a higher state where a realised soul can
feel it, who is born as a realised soul can feel it.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:45.967
And in that state they just know like a computer.

00:23:46.329 --> 00:23:52.874
They don’t bother as to which is the one, and they
don’t put hands or anything, they just feel it, it is so.

00:23:53.075 --> 00:23:56.767
As you have seen in my granddaughter’s
case, you see she just knows what is what.

00:23:57.017 --> 00:24:00.546
Just see, you ask her, she’ll immediately
say, “This is this, this is this,” like.

00:24:00.746 --> 00:24:04.076
It comes plain to them absolutely, “This is this.”

00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:09.019
Now you may say that how do they know? But
this procedure becomes such a compact thing,

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:15.628
I mean it just happens to you, like you pin prick me
here and immediately the hand goes back, you see sort of

00:24:15.829 --> 00:24:18.739
the whole reflex action is so quick

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.217
that we can say there’s no
procedure as such but it’s just a reflex action.

00:24:22.418 --> 00:24:28.366
In the same way it acts as a reflex action; so
that you don’t have to worry about the purpose of it.

00:24:28.945 --> 00:24:35.067
That is state where we say the karana
state is reached. And the mahakarana state.

00:24:35.932 --> 00:24:40.828
Now this is the third stage is it? And even
in the karana stage there are three stages

00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:44.533
into which one feels it.
Now that is, I would say that,

00:24:44.734 --> 00:24:49.277
I need not explain because
that’s beyond you people but

00:24:49.478 --> 00:24:52.886
if you are born realised you will understand that

00:24:53.086 --> 00:25:00.692
the imbalance in a personality of the three gunas,

00:25:00.893 --> 00:25:06.241
see of the three gunas is immediately perceived
by a born realised person, immediately perceived!

00:25:06.441 --> 00:25:12.335
He can see through, you see. That’s the wisdom he
has gained in his previous lives and previous births and

00:25:12.536 --> 00:25:17.315
immediately they can see the imbalance
that comes in. And whatever they say is so wise

00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:21.283
and they understand because they can
see the imbalance of these three gunas.

00:25:21.483 --> 00:25:26.617
And according to their own gunas,
whichever are prevalent in them;

00:25:26.817 --> 00:25:29.723
these three stages exist in them the way they say.

00:25:29.923 --> 00:25:37.183
For example some people,
have a say are more say, tamogunis:

00:25:37.384 --> 00:25:41.920
means the ones who are very emotional type
people, among them some are very emotional.

00:25:42.233 --> 00:25:48.182
So they see a person through the
emotions, the way they feel in themselves.

00:25:48.383 --> 00:25:52.417
They call it a feeling. “I had a
feeling for such a person. I felt that way.”

00:25:52.617 --> 00:25:56.202
That is the word they use. But
supposing the person is a rajoguni,

00:25:56.402 --> 00:26:00.043
he has been more towards the going through..

00:26:00.243 --> 00:26:07.492
he has been working on the rajoguna
like praying to Surya and doing Gayatri

00:26:07.692 --> 00:26:13.783
and praying to all the heavenly bodies
and also the five elements, like that.

00:26:13.983 --> 00:26:18.185
If he has been doing yagyas
and all those things he’s a rajoguni.

00:26:18.385 --> 00:26:22.717
Such people see them
as lights, as electrical forms;

00:26:22.917 --> 00:26:27.841
so they see them as colours and things, you see.

00:26:28.436 --> 00:26:31.928
So one sees it as an emotional thing

00:26:32.261 --> 00:26:37.517
another sees it as a colour
or you can say as any form.

00:26:37.717 --> 00:26:44.083
They see them as forms, as colours, lights.

00:26:44.322 --> 00:26:47.405
They see as electrical currents

00:26:47.605 --> 00:26:53.445
and some see them as a different flowers.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:27:00.109
Now they are feelings

00:27:00.938 --> 00:27:07.493
and also they are these rajoguni expressions,

00:27:07.693 --> 00:27:10.547
which you can see with your
eye, you see The Creation itself.

00:27:10.747 --> 00:27:12.636
But they are also feelings.

00:27:12.837 --> 00:27:15.401
So those who can see feelings more,

00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:21.411
a person who has been very loving
and has dealt in this side of life in..

00:27:21.611 --> 00:27:24.676
who has been a bhakti man, a dedicated man,

00:27:24.876 --> 00:27:27.681
who has been praying to God and crying for Him

00:27:27.881 --> 00:27:32.551
and asking for His help and
weeping before Him with all his heart.

00:27:32.884 --> 00:27:36.388
Such a man will feel a person more

00:27:36.588 --> 00:27:42.038
and a person who is a more
dedicated to forms and things

00:27:42.255 --> 00:27:46.282
will see them in a different way as forms so,

00:27:46.482 --> 00:27:49.953
then they see them in colours
because they’re also colours.

00:27:50.154 --> 00:27:53.705
They’re also colours and they’re also sounds.

00:27:54.045 --> 00:27:57.747
So the sound is also one of the
elements, so they can see a sound.

00:27:57.947 --> 00:28:02.481
And they also see them when their Kundalini
moves, you see, they see the sound moving.

00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:07.219
and they also saw - Most of the people
who have seen this have been the people

00:28:07.419 --> 00:28:13.225
who have been meditating through this,

00:28:13.488 --> 00:28:17.196
we can say the Patanjali style of meditation

00:28:17.396 --> 00:28:20.358
where they were single people
Parashurama style, you see.

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:23.453
And they saw these forms

00:28:23.654 --> 00:28:29.241
and they saw the movement of
the Kundalini through the chakras,

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:33.293
when it passes, it creates a sound, a word.

00:28:33.912 --> 00:28:37.288
And so they studied every sound how,

00:28:37.488 --> 00:28:40.886
which sound was created, what
sound was created what colour was there.

00:28:41.086 --> 00:28:45.491
And so it is the one-sided
knowledge of the right-hand side,

00:28:45.691 --> 00:28:49.034
of the people who went to the
right-hand side that they say that,

00:28:49.234 --> 00:28:53.885
“This thing was created, that thing was
created and then this sound was created.”

00:28:54.282 --> 00:28:58.484
Then they formed the language – it’s the
original Sanskrit language which was formed.

00:28:58.684 --> 00:29:00.706
That’s why it’s called as a Devavani.

00:29:00.906 --> 00:29:03.861
And that’s why these Deities
understand Sanskrit the best.

00:29:04.061 --> 00:29:09.248
When you say Sanskrit mantras you see,
they absolutely understand them very fast

00:29:09.448 --> 00:29:11.750
because this has come originally from there.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:14.453
They studied that and then it closed off.

00:29:14.819 --> 00:29:18.910
But other languages in India,

00:29:19.287 --> 00:29:24.329
most of the languages, were taken from
Sanskrit converted into something else,

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:28.567
brought to another form and then
another Sanskrit came in – Takruta Sanskrit,

00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:33.505
then these five languages – Magadi,
Paishachi, Marathi, all these languages came in.

00:29:33.706 --> 00:29:38.927
So it is derivation. Other languages in
other countries that came up, you see.

00:29:39.128 --> 00:29:44.651
was also of course the
expression of the Kundalini,

00:29:44.851 --> 00:29:48.960
but they learnt it more from say,

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.224
the words came from the outside;

00:29:52.424 --> 00:29:57.963
the sound of the air flowing they
call it ‘ssss’, so they call it ’s’ like that.

00:29:58.163 --> 00:30:01.366
And from the nature what ever
they learnt from outside, because

00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:07.433
the approach has been more objective; so objective
approach is always little less than the subjective

00:30:07.633 --> 00:30:11.410
because subjective is from inside and objective is
from outside.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.780
So when you go from the objective, the deviation

00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:18.121
into the main sound that
are coming from the inside, you see,

00:30:18.321 --> 00:30:21.190
the purity is little bit deviated.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.763
And you know what is objective
and subjectivity approach.

00:30:24.964 --> 00:30:30.493
So this has happened with some languages.
Some languages are very, very close to Sanskrit

00:30:33.082 --> 00:30:36.858
but they too took a turn according to their gunas.

00:30:37.059 --> 00:30:45.057
Now, the Satvaguni (सत्त्वगुणि), the central
path or the Satvaguni as they call it, you see.

00:30:45.258 --> 00:30:51.083
they are also the people who
have Satvaguna more in them;

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:56.121
they see chakras in the right form.

00:30:56.805 --> 00:31:01.254
But Satvagunis should not be
confused with the people who believe that

00:31:01.455 --> 00:31:06.331
if you eat this then this is satvik,
if you eat that that is tamasik

00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:12.070
or if you say this, this is satvik or if
you do not kill anybody then it is satvik.

00:31:12.552 --> 00:31:15.857
In this the right perception
comes in. For example,

00:31:16.298 --> 00:31:21.647
you have to explain why
Krishna killed so many rakshasas.

00:31:21.847 --> 00:31:26.675
It was absolutely satva; is
dharmic, absolutely dharmic.

00:31:26.876 --> 00:31:34.495
Why Durga killed so many rakshasas? She
had to eat the blood of so many rakshasas.

00:31:34.892 --> 00:31:37.763
So whatever is dharmic,

00:31:39.828 --> 00:31:43.435
the wisdom, the right path

00:31:43.884 --> 00:31:47.713
comes through such people who are

00:31:48.272 --> 00:31:52.118
neither too much this side, neither that side

00:31:52.319 --> 00:31:59.985
and they know exactly what is
the right way of looking at life.

00:32:00.588 --> 00:32:07.893
Such born realised people: this is a
very, very far-fetched stuff they are very few.

00:32:08.897 --> 00:32:15.767
I would say perhaps you
can say Buddha and Mahavira

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:20.690
are the only two human beings
who have gone through many lives,

00:32:20.891 --> 00:32:23.875
from one extreme to another they went

00:32:24.224 --> 00:32:29.856
and ultimately they found out that
going to the extremes is not proper.

00:32:30.057 --> 00:32:36.295
Still they have not reached the
complete height of an incarnation.

00:32:36.496 --> 00:32:39.458
So a model was to be created

00:32:39.658 --> 00:32:44.968
who would all the time be giving
a fixed point for a person to rise to that.

00:32:45.169 --> 00:32:51.840
And these are the different models
which are placed within us on our chakras.

00:32:52.041 --> 00:32:58.577
And these models are perfect points belonging
to those chakras.

00:32:58.777 --> 00:33:03.348
So according to the nature

00:33:03.548 --> 00:33:07.486
of the person who is watching these chakras,

00:33:08.272 --> 00:33:11.272
one sees them and gives them importance also.

00:33:11.473 --> 00:33:16.094
Now for a person like say, [Adi] Shankacharya:

00:33:16.913 --> 00:33:20.855
Shankacharya is a born realised soul many a times.

00:33:21.056 --> 00:33:24.736
He’s not born realised once, but
many a times he’s born realised,

00:33:24.936 --> 00:33:29.241
and he’s sort of, he’s in the centre of it
you can say, one of them, you can call him.

00:33:29.809 --> 00:33:34.477
So when he talks of his Mooladhara chakra he is
sort of,

00:33:34.677 --> 00:33:39.842
he has already done the path many a times and
now he’s going to the subtler and subtler and subtler form.

00:33:40.042 --> 00:33:47.738
So when he says that the Mooladhara chakra is
opened out then you can walk on the water it’s correct,

00:33:47.938 --> 00:33:51.830
because he is at that subtle stage of ascendence.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:56.334
One has to ascend once,
second time, third time, forth times,

00:33:56.588 --> 00:34:00.029
and then you see, you reach a
stage where you start ascending.

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:06.386
But even then it is not so important to walk on the
water what is so important to walk on the water?

00:34:06.587 --> 00:34:10.816
It’s nothing so important because you
see it’s easy, you can take a boat and walk!

00:34:11.301 --> 00:34:17.326
It’s nothing so important! So walking on
the [water], means also on the right hand side;

00:34:17.527 --> 00:34:21.893
it’s a right-hand side to walk
on the water or to fly in the air,

00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:29.103
all this is the right-hand side things which
also can be done with the help of a boat,

00:34:29.303 --> 00:34:33.992
or what you call an aircraft
or even you can use a bhoot!

00:34:34.192 --> 00:34:39.778
For that you can use a dead entity and we
can make him take us to any place we feel like.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:47.490
It can be done! This ESP business is only
that. So it can be done by other methods also.

00:34:47.691 --> 00:34:54.162
So it is nothing important. You see, it’s sometimes very
confusing when we see that some people can fly in the air!

00:34:54.362 --> 00:34:59.837
They say in the subtle form they have gone. You don’t
see the body moving but you see that they they can feel it.

00:35:00.037 --> 00:35:03.301
The difference being that
the people who are realised

00:35:03.592 --> 00:35:06.715
can guide themselves and can see the body moving

00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:11.810
but those who are not realised they
find that their subtle-being being taken out

00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:15.814
and their consciousness going with them somewhere
else and they’re sitting on top of the house;

00:35:16.014 --> 00:35:20.326
from there watching themselves and they’re sitting there
and they see themselves sitting down like that, you see.

00:35:20.526 --> 00:35:23.522
These phenomenon take
place. That is absolutely nothing

00:35:23.722 --> 00:35:31.429
but a soul being ridden by a dead entity.

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:36.206
So there’s nothing great about
it. That is also right-side stuff.

00:35:36.407 --> 00:35:40.343
The left hand side as I told you is
the emotional feeling about things.

00:35:40.835 --> 00:35:45.184
You feel tremendous love for others
and sometimes you know people…

00:35:45.385 --> 00:35:48.607
I would say Sainath was one of them

00:35:48.808 --> 00:35:53.447
who had this left hand side gift
with him, and he was love personified

00:35:53.648 --> 00:36:00.679
and he was so much full of love for people that

00:36:00.879 --> 00:36:06.498
once there was a woman who was very
poor and she couldn’t celebrate her Diwali day

00:36:06.698 --> 00:36:10.622
and he couldn’t bear it so he gave her
some water and the water became like oil

00:36:10.822 --> 00:36:15.236
and she burnt lights in that; and it’s
a fact, you can do that, it’s possible.

00:36:15.437 --> 00:36:21.220
And with this power you can
increase food, sort of thing you see.

00:36:21.421 --> 00:36:24.316
you increase the food stuff, like Christ did it.

00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:29.246
That’s also one side (left side). So
all these things come in a personality;

00:36:29.698 --> 00:36:34.320
some people have one more another has some
more and some people have all these qualities.

00:36:34.521 --> 00:36:38.691
Some, those who are incarnations have everything.
They can do everything that they want to.

00:36:38.891 --> 00:36:42.701
And they will use whatever they want to do and if
they don’t want use any powers they will not use.

00:36:42.901 --> 00:36:45.070
So it depends on…

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:50.842
so it’s nothing important, supposing you see
something alright, there you can see it is a good thing.

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:56.792
But that doesn’t mean that you should stick on to
those things but you must, try to do what you don’t see.

00:36:56.993 --> 00:37:02.386
For example, now you see the
light coming out of somebody’s head,

00:37:02.587 --> 00:37:09.020
now that’s one side of looking at things.
Another is that you can feel the another person.

00:37:09.221 --> 00:37:15.287
Don’t you feel the another person?
How he is, how he meets you,

00:37:15.488 --> 00:37:18.667
how you are coming closer to that person.

00:37:18.868 --> 00:37:24.809
Can you feel that compassion for
him that he’s not where you are?

00:37:25.146 --> 00:37:29.447
That also is another balancing
stuff. But this should done...

00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:34.849
This is very dangerous for some people who try to be helpful
to others when they are not themselves solidified properly.

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:38.456
So I would again warn you that
when you start seeing lights and all that

00:37:38.656 --> 00:37:41.506
try to remember that you are going
on one side, you are seeing more.

00:37:41.706 --> 00:37:45.497
Then be more compassionate in you
tongues, in your talking in your behaviour.

00:37:45.697 --> 00:37:50.635
Try to have more love. Means right hand side is
more developing, the left is less; is the heart.

00:37:51.263 --> 00:37:55.340
So you have to raise your Kundalini from right and
left, but this is all mechanical and it works out.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:58.810
It’s only thinking about it, “Oh, I
have to develop my heart more,”

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:02.080
the balance has to be there. This
also should develop feeling for others.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.767
Now the feeling for others cannot
be explained as I feel for others.

00:38:07.133 --> 00:38:11.389
I just, if somebody is crying anywhere
I get tears into my eyes automatically.

00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:16.996
Even if you are not crying and if you are feeling
hurt about things I get this hurt feeling with Myself.

00:38:17.197 --> 00:38:24.089
Like that, you see, you should really feel that
hurt feeling and that desperate feeling and that cry.

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:28.306
Of course I mean, it comes to some people
too much but they do not have the other side.

00:38:28.506 --> 00:38:34.216
So you should have both the sides and
both the balancing directors within you.

00:38:34.416 --> 00:38:39.084
So those who are seeing things more should
not go on bothering about what they are seeing.

00:38:39.284 --> 00:38:43.755
“It’s coming that way, alright” because they
have done that kind of tapasya so they see things.

00:38:43.955 --> 00:38:47.617
And it helps Sahaja Yoga very much because you can

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:51.776
see for yourself who is realised
who’s not realised, this thing, that thing.

00:38:51.976 --> 00:38:55.376
But still the dryness is in you.

00:38:55.576 --> 00:38:58.136
So if it is in you, you should try to develop it.

00:38:58.336 --> 00:39:02.774
So whatever you don’t have you try to develop
that. Whatever you have don’t be satisfied with that.

00:39:03.457 --> 00:39:09.036
That’s the best way you can rise. Those people
who can see things should try to feel others.

00:39:09.236 --> 00:39:13.485
Those who can feel others should see
things and it will work out that way.

00:39:13.685 --> 00:39:19.991
So this is what it is. And in the
Mahakarana state where the Mahakarana is,

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:25.497
that is a very, very subtlest form of state,

00:39:25.697 --> 00:39:33.304
where the chakras which have got the Deities

00:39:33.966 --> 00:39:37.191
are connected with the,

00:39:37.391 --> 00:39:44.215
are sort of a reflection of
the Deities of the Viraata.

00:39:44.826 --> 00:39:49.187
Now these Deities in the
Viraata are reflected in you,

00:39:49.387 --> 00:39:51.993
are awakened in you and they start moving

00:39:52.193 --> 00:39:57.829
and making the whole
thing work out as it should be.

00:39:58.029 --> 00:40:00.872
Up to the karana state it is very
good.

00:40:01.072 --> 00:40:05.403
But the Mahakarana state is
the stage where it is the real –

00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:08.286
what you call the object – object and reflection.

00:40:08.487 --> 00:40:15.880
When you can come up to the object which is a
really deep state of mind where you are with the object

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:20.630
and when you are at the object you
are very close to an incarnation state.

00:40:20.831 --> 00:40:28.626
So we can say that as far
as you people are concerned

00:40:28.826 --> 00:40:31.362
you should try to understand up to karana state,

00:40:31.562 --> 00:40:36.167
because beyond that how to jump and
how to go is not the question just now.

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:39.550
What’s the use of telling you about
something which is a far fetched stuff?

00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:44.157
So we’ll talk about it later. But this is
how it is the fourth stage of chakras.

00:40:44.358 --> 00:40:48.337
Now, tentza prashna? Ah, te chakra. Ha.
(marathi: His question? Ah, about chakras. ok.)

00:40:48.537 --> 00:40:54.686
He says you see it anti-clockwise. You do see. Because most
of the people who have seen it have seen it on other people

00:40:54.886 --> 00:40:59.224
and when you see on other people from the
backside, you see it on the anti-clockwise side.

00:40:59.424 --> 00:41:02.727
But, if you see it from the
front, it is clockwise, that’s why.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:06.784
Yogi: No, what I am saying is
– you feel the chakras moving,

00:41:06.984 --> 00:41:10.259
you are outside your own body, still the
chakras are moving in an anti-clockwise manner.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:14.155
Shri Mataji: Yes it depends on, you know,
what I’ve just now told you: that the chakras,

00:41:14.355 --> 00:41:19.146
say for example, for an ordinary human being
the chakras are nothing but ordinary plexuses;

00:41:19.346 --> 00:41:21.841
for a realised soul it is more than that.

00:41:22.042 --> 00:41:27.494
So the more you move into a
greater view of your own awareness

00:41:27.694 --> 00:41:33.157
that’s how the chakras start manifesting.
Now for example my chakras are working all over.

00:41:34.122 --> 00:41:37.122
All over. Do you see the difference?

00:41:38.011 --> 00:41:42.435
So it depends on the awareness of the person.

00:41:42.635 --> 00:41:49.440
As much as the light now say; that much it shows
extension of the light, you see as much as the power.

00:41:49.857 --> 00:41:52.857
So that is what it is.

00:42:05.982 --> 00:42:11.712
Now is there are any questions left on chakras?
Yogi: About the number of petals.

00:42:11.918 --> 00:42:15.733
Shri Mataji: Yes. Number of
petals are also gross stuff you see.

00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:19.304
Till you go to a certain stage
where your petals are being created,

00:42:19.504 --> 00:42:24.500
because of a, there’s a little
mathematics about it, little mathematics.

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:28.913
And all this mathematics has been
worked out in a human being – how it is.

00:42:29.113 --> 00:42:36.287
But these are the…we can say that now for example,

00:42:36.757 --> 00:42:40.149
in a person now, a light is there:

00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:46.060
say 25, what do you call? 25? Watts. 25 watts.

00:42:46.261 --> 00:42:51.764
Now 25 watts are to be converted say

00:42:52.316 --> 00:42:56.240
to say 60 watts or something like that.

00:42:56.547 --> 00:43:01.995
So we have to see the dimension into which the
person, means that portion, is going to grow, you see.

00:43:02.195 --> 00:43:06.619
It’s a big mathematics about you. The
dimension to which that can grow you see

00:43:06.819 --> 00:43:10.174
and into what sphere it is going to penetrate.

00:43:10.374 --> 00:43:16.822
For example, the Mooladhara chakra
you can take for an example now.

00:43:17.022 --> 00:43:22.600
Mooladhara chakra is actually fourth that way,

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.504
because it covers the four
sides of the human personality.

00:43:26.704 --> 00:43:30.987
It’s in the abstract calculation,

00:43:31.188 --> 00:43:37.515
it is the fourth side of the personality. And the
fifth side, the movement in the fifth dimension,

00:43:37.965 --> 00:43:43.838
doesn’t take in the Mooladhara chakra.
It takes above the Mooladhara chakra.

00:43:44.171 --> 00:43:47.759
So the fourth dimensions
as shown by that, you see.

00:43:47.959 --> 00:43:50.361
These are the different dimensions of a man.

00:43:50.561 --> 00:43:57.101
At those levels how many dimensions you
touch by these tattoos – it is calculated like that.

00:43:57.301 --> 00:44:01.392
In My book I have given notes
of these in very great details as to

00:44:01.592 --> 00:44:06.495
what are the dimensions one
touches in this state and how far you go.

00:44:06.696 --> 00:44:10.114
But the same Mooladhara becomes only two later on.

00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:16.921
But it is such a subtle and sharp two
which penetrates just like this, all over.

00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:22.652
So it depends on…you can say in a machine

00:44:22.853 --> 00:44:27.067
you have different types of
bones and different types of..

00:44:27.813 --> 00:44:31.663
screws and with different dates.

00:44:31.864 --> 00:44:35.810
Now what is the calculation? Is
there any reason you can say why it is so?

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:40.399
So it is a very detailed work and it’s all
worked out because the dimensions into which

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:46.760
a human being will be going, all that is worked out,
and on that chakra only these is dimensions you achieve.

00:44:46.961 --> 00:44:51.290
So it has a meaning. But it’s not
only four chakras. It’s not only four.

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:55.294
It has got many petals inside
and it’s a very interesting one.

00:44:55.494 --> 00:45:00.031
Actually on Mooladhara I have written a big
chapter, complete. How many folds are inside

00:45:00.231 --> 00:45:03.632
and how these things work out and how many folds,

00:45:03.832 --> 00:45:10.341
what do they suggest and how far they open out,
because it’s all a dimension which is worked out.

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:13.711
For example, if you take a
banyan tree, the seed is so small.

00:45:13.911 --> 00:45:16.481
A banyan tree has the smallest seed. Now
why is it so?

00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:20.585
And why is it so microscopic?
Because it is so dynamic.

00:45:20.871 --> 00:45:24.654
For you this is all worked out like a capsule.

00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:29.593
And it’s a capsule which is to work this
dimension, it has to work that dimension.

00:45:29.794 --> 00:45:33.598
So it is rather a calculated
stuff – which I have described.

00:45:33.798 --> 00:45:41.332
I have only described Mooladhara really in the fullest
because it makes such a big volume of one Mooladhara chakra,

00:45:41.533 --> 00:45:44.164
that I gave up about others. I
have just mentioned about them.

00:45:44.365 --> 00:45:48.966
But only Mooladhara itself, when I started
describing, it became such a big, huge thing.

00:45:49.167 --> 00:45:54.861
I gave in I said, “Now better not do other
ones.” But it’s quite a complicated stuff and,

00:45:57.214 --> 00:46:02.860
You see God has his own stage or style
of planning and we can’t question Him.

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:06.076
He does it according to His
own whim. He has his own style.

00:46:06.276 --> 00:46:10.339
But [even] His whim has
understanding – everything has.

00:46:11.509 --> 00:46:15.839
You will find that sometimes
if you try to study that.

00:46:16.039 --> 00:46:20.912
If you ask Me certain things I try to
answer it in a different way, you see.

00:46:21.239 --> 00:46:26.551
Because there are His ways of doing things
and He understands and that’s how He does it.

00:46:26.751 --> 00:46:29.820
But still I have tried to bring
out at least Mooladhara chakra,

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:37.460
so that human beings must understand that how complicated they are
made, how God has been so careful to place their Mooladhara so well

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:40.831
and how He has put the force
there, how it’s a living machinery,

00:46:41.031 --> 00:46:45.303
how it’s working out so that people should
understand the importance of their chakras

00:46:45.503 --> 00:46:49.179
and importance of their being, how
important you are. You are not ordinary people.

00:46:49.379 --> 00:46:54.802
Even if there’s a say an ordinary
tape recorder, we are so careful about it.

00:46:55.003 --> 00:47:02.620
How much we should be careful about our own machinery, which is
being created in ages with such great understanding, such mechanism!

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:08.092
Every chakra if you take up, even if you take
up three yugas, you won’t understand one chakra.

00:47:08.292 --> 00:47:10.561
It is such a tremendous working inside.

00:47:10.761 --> 00:47:16.050
I have of course given only the description of it

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:21.439
and the reason why is a stage
which will make you really mad!

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:27.886
But I’ve tried to explain in that. You have read my
Mooladhara did you? It’s quite an elaborate stuff.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:36.387
Question: In Delhi, the question
was “what is the purpose of life?”

00:47:36.587 --> 00:47:42.177
...said of all these incarnations
is to go in Nirvana which is...

00:47:42.377 --> 00:47:44.729
nothing happened then

00:47:46.516 --> 00:47:51.159
...Of self perfection which is concieve as,
so tell you are one with God which is immovability

00:47:51.359 --> 00:47:56.707
Now you said you cannot like this, you are
going to incarnate, I mean liberation is not just,

00:47:57.343 --> 00:48:01.791
something which is demobilize some what,
you are going to incarnate again and again.

00:48:02.049 --> 00:48:04.815
Then the question I would
like to ask, the connection...

00:48:05.015 --> 00:48:10.921
what is the purpose of life? I understood before but the
simple thing is to be united with God, whatever this means

00:48:11.121 --> 00:48:14.039
and when I you enlighten because
there is no movement anymore but

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:17.995
Shri Mataji: that stage I never
cancelled it, that stage is not today.

00:48:18.232 --> 00:48:22.833
You see when I said it that just now you have to
incarnate again and again. You are not at that stage.

00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:27.537
But when the whole thing…you see,
nothing is wrong in any one of these.

00:48:27.737 --> 00:48:33.110
When they say, “There is a day of judgement.”
But before that God is going to give you a chance.

00:48:33.350 --> 00:48:36.814
He is going to give you a full chance
to improve yourself go to that position.

00:48:37.014 --> 00:48:43.721
You see, like that, we can say that, first
the trees are brought into the by sowing the seeds

00:48:43.921 --> 00:48:49.114
then the trees grow up, then there are flowers,
then the flowers are again, they become seeds.

00:48:49.314 --> 00:48:52.684
Then again the trees and again this
thing, until again they reach a certain stage,

00:48:52.885 --> 00:48:59.236
till they have completely ripened then they remove the
whole thing and the whole thing becomes the Brahma itself.

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:03.174
And whatever is a waste matter
is thrown out. So ultimately it’s the union.

00:49:03.374 --> 00:49:07.278
But the “union of your being” means with God.

00:49:07.782 --> 00:49:12.717
It’s a much greater state.
First of all it’s the purification point.

00:49:12.917 --> 00:49:19.357
You see for your purification you are to be born again. You have not
reached that stage where you should become Mahanirvana, have you?

00:49:19.557 --> 00:49:23.494
If you become, might be you might
land up in hell so better not try that!

00:49:23.694 --> 00:49:27.865
See, you must understand that just now,
at this stage you have to go further,

00:49:28.065 --> 00:49:34.354
purifying yourself till you reach a certain stage you
see where, when you reach a certain stage, at that time,

00:49:34.554 --> 00:49:38.309
God has given you enough chance,
enough chance to improve yourself.

00:49:38.509 --> 00:49:42.046
still you are rakshasas then you are not going to
be tried anymore.

00:49:42.246 --> 00:49:47.793
But it’s quite clear, I must say.
You cannot now allow it to take to chance.

00:49:53.517 --> 00:49:59.798
One of the butchery is going to be very close,
is very close; I mean I would say can be anytime.

00:49:59.999 --> 00:50:03.000
So you be careful I mean, it’s just there.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.738
So many have to be neutralised
because they are just very troublesome.

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:14.454
So it can be quite close
so just be careful about it.

00:50:14.655 --> 00:50:18.816
So, you see, if everything fits into everything
else but what happens is every religion,

00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:22.119
part of it is said so this cuts out the other.

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:27.158
Supposing I say, “You have to go to this room,” now
if I say that, “You have to come two steps that side,”

00:50:27.358 --> 00:50:31.512
and then I say, “You have to come three steps this
side,” these are all connected stuff

00:50:31.712 --> 00:50:36.834
but because it is said only three steps here so you said,
“Then in that religion it is said three steps inside you

00:50:37.034 --> 00:50:40.139
and what about those two steps?”
I have to tell about them also.

00:50:40.339 --> 00:50:43.593
Because I have to tell about all
those two steps you have to take first,

00:50:43.793 --> 00:50:47.645
I better not tell about these three steps
because you’ll put your eyes, oh, very nice.

00:50:47.845 --> 00:50:50.214
It’s not going to come in a plate.

00:50:50.414 --> 00:50:53.437
You have to work it out consciously.

00:50:54.912 --> 00:50:57.412
Understand now?

00:50:58.492 --> 00:51:04.508
Yogi: Last time you were saying that after death, in
which Atma and the Kundalini, do they end up somewhere?

00:51:04.709 --> 00:51:06.851
Shri Mataji: Body.

00:51:07.052 --> 00:51:09.912
But where do the go, the chakras go?

00:51:10.112 --> 00:51:12.973
Shri Mataji: Chakra's exist
within you, chakras is a place.

00:51:13.174 --> 00:51:17.904
They just only exist within you.
Yogi: Within the Earth element?

00:51:18.105 --> 00:51:20.735
Shri Mataji: No, no, no.
Yogi: How is it going?

00:51:20.936 --> 00:51:26.150
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. They are in the body only, they are in the
body. The body is itself like a seed, you see, you become like a seed.

00:51:26.350 --> 00:51:29.987
But they are potent. You can’t
see them. Chakra is a state.

00:51:30.187 --> 00:51:35.025
Yogi: I think chakra and
kundalini must be living together?

00:51:35.225 --> 00:51:41.065
Shri Mataji: No, no. It is something like
a light going out and the tube is still there.

00:51:41.265 --> 00:51:45.169
It is like that the Kundalini. But it
stays on top of the head of the person.

00:51:45.369 --> 00:51:48.539
The only difference is, supposing,
the light goes out and stays near by.

00:51:48.739 --> 00:51:52.610
You see the potential is
there in the light. It is like that.

00:51:52.810 --> 00:51:55.956
The place for the light to pass is there.

00:51:56.156 --> 00:52:01.018
Question: (inaudible)..and one more thing..

00:52:08.052 --> 00:52:12.029
then that particular person goes to both...

00:52:13.213 --> 00:52:16.446
Shri Mataji: Extremes.
Yogi: The extremes and in that creates,

00:52:16.646 --> 00:52:21.257
you know what happens before
realisation? Whether they are...

00:52:24.809 --> 00:52:30.296
Shri Mataji: No, no. They’re already separated in the
gross they are separated; inside also they’re separated

00:52:30.496 --> 00:52:35.286
but there’s a void because yes,
that is the only point.

00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:39.472
You see, the Kundalini gets enlightened

00:52:39.706 --> 00:52:43.093
or sort of she gets a little
enlightened you can say

00:52:43.293 --> 00:52:46.626
when it faces me and it immediately
starts rising. Or when you people,

00:52:46.826 --> 00:52:49.066
because you are also Sahaja Yogis.

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:52.536
It doesn’t happen with anybody
else you will be amazed you know.

00:52:54.035 --> 00:52:56.540
So now what is the other question?

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:16.980
Question: How do the chakras
move in the body; is it horizontally?

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.878
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. That is
true, they are moving horizontally.

00:53:20.079 --> 00:53:23.046
They are moving horizontal
but when you move them like this, you see;

00:53:23.247 --> 00:53:26.389
like you have seen the wheel…
Question: Why not you go this way?

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:32.910
Shri Mataji: No it doesn’t work out. It works out better this
way. Because these are the things that are emitting, you see.

00:53:33.111 --> 00:53:37.978
If you do it like this it goes down. This
way these are moving you can move this.

00:53:38.178 --> 00:53:43.154
You have seen that in a watch there are
some like this parallel and some are like this.

00:53:48.742 --> 00:53:56.237
Ata dusra kai prashna ahe? (marathi:
now what other question is there?)

00:53:56.437 --> 00:54:00.504
Yogini: Mataji, you said the
different gurus have different...

00:54:02.461 --> 00:54:05.776
the fake gurus have damaged the chakras.

00:54:07.111 --> 00:54:13.183
How do they do it? And what’s to be done about it?

00:54:14.532 --> 00:54:18.922
Shri Mataji: You see, what gurus do is
they use different chakras

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:26.516
for introducing into the sympathetic nervous system
some entities which they have controlled, you see.

00:54:26.717 --> 00:54:30.267
They do not control
many entities as such, but what happens,

00:54:31.209 --> 00:54:37.508
for example now I would say, during war many
people died just like that; killed and this and that.

00:54:37.996 --> 00:54:41.011
In those countries, those souls,

00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:46.895
you see they were never,
sort of - well never had a human life

00:54:47.095 --> 00:54:51.622
and they were treated just like animals
and they were very much tortured.

00:54:51.822 --> 00:54:56.226
So they had that feeling in their minds
that, “We should also torture these people.”

00:54:56.593 --> 00:55:02.933
So when they die they do not die really and
they do not get into the pretloka (Spirit world).

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:06.437
They stay in the atmosphere and
that’s why wars are very bad things,

00:55:06.637 --> 00:55:10.038
because wars create such human
beings much more, with accidents and

00:55:10.239 --> 00:55:13.243
people who are very
depraved in life, very dissatisfied

00:55:13.443 --> 00:55:16.515
who are doing all kinds of depraved actions and

00:55:16.716 --> 00:55:21.663
secretive things and all kinds
of horrid things. All such people, all of them,

00:55:21.863 --> 00:55:25.599
when they die they do not
really go to pretaloka because

00:55:25.799 --> 00:55:30.322
they don’t think of their salvation but
they are just thinking of their lust, greed

00:55:30.522 --> 00:55:34.264
or we can say possessions,

00:55:34.464 --> 00:55:38.669
those who are grabbing things,
thieves and all sorts of people.

00:55:39.733 --> 00:55:44.093
We can call ‘evil’ people and
satanic people, when they die

00:55:44.293 --> 00:55:48.312
they find they become much
more subtler and they can be

00:55:48.512 --> 00:55:50.865
better off if they act in a subtle body.

00:55:51.065 --> 00:55:55.219
So they use the subtle body for acting
into people and such people are easily available.

00:55:55.419 --> 00:55:58.692
So these gurus, what they do, that
they themselves are evil geniuses,

00:55:58.892 --> 00:56:02.782
and they have a way of capturing
those people and they use them.

00:56:02.983 --> 00:56:05.326
And they introduce to you
through your different chakras.

00:56:05.526 --> 00:56:10.334
For example, Ravana had a capacity to speak and
in his speech he used to introduce rakshasas

00:56:10.534 --> 00:56:14.235
into the human beings in Ceylon.
Otherwise imagine in Lanka,

00:56:14.435 --> 00:56:20.210
people should never fight Rama, because at
that time the sensitivity of people was so great

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:23.914
that they knew that Rama was an incarnation.
They were not gross as today they are that,

00:56:24.114 --> 00:56:27.034
one has to tell that, “Oh,
here I am the incarnation.”

00:56:27.235 --> 00:56:30.419
That time it was not Kali Yuga so
they knew he was an incarnation.

00:56:30.619 --> 00:56:35.989
And so many of them, I mean some of them did not,
but quite a lot of them knew and despite that

00:56:36.189 --> 00:56:39.261
nobody could oppose it because their,

00:56:40.102 --> 00:56:43.925
mind was captured by these entities
put by Ravana and they fought Him.

00:56:44.126 --> 00:56:47.971
So, it was so, even at the time of
Krishna: people knew who He was at least

00:56:48.171 --> 00:56:50.927
they had quite an idea,
even Kauravas new about it.

00:56:51.128 --> 00:56:55.078
But this Kali Yuga is a wretched
thing – nobody see anything clearly.

00:56:55.278 --> 00:57:01.537
But those times were not like that. People knew
who was an incarnation and they understood it.

00:57:01.738 --> 00:57:06.830
At that time also, these people had to use
some sort of a way of putting them off and

00:57:07.031 --> 00:57:09.560
they used this method of enticement.

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.896
And when they used this
method of enticement, in that use,

00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:19.036
they learned also subtler ways and subtler ways which they
are using in Kali Yuga very well. They are actually rakshasas

00:57:19.236 --> 00:57:23.473
and they know these methods – how to
entice people. There are so many ways of doing it.

00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:27.845
And when you bend your head before them

00:57:28.045 --> 00:57:32.973
that is the best time when they can put it into your
ego and they can finish you off for once for all.

00:57:33.174 --> 00:57:36.324
So that’s how they do it.
And you are no more yourself!

00:57:36.525 --> 00:57:42.014
First of all they act on your heart: you become a nervous
person your hands start shaking your feet start shaking;

00:57:42.215 --> 00:57:45.623
they act on your heart chakra.
You lose the power of raksha

00:57:45.823 --> 00:57:49.970
which is the basic point of the heart chakra.

00:57:52.272 --> 00:57:57.841
And then, once you start losing the
grip over your nerves you find that

00:57:58.041 --> 00:58:03.647
as if somebody is doing for you. And if you take somebody’s name you
start jumping and you don’t know anything – it’s an experience, you see.

00:58:03.847 --> 00:58:07.150
There are so many things they
do like that: thousand and one.

00:58:07.741 --> 00:58:12.456
But human beings, as a whole in the Kali Yuga,

00:58:12.656 --> 00:58:16.593
instead of improving has
gone down absolutely in his,

00:58:17.219 --> 00:58:21.235
conception of Divinity and in everything.

00:58:21.436 --> 00:58:26.713
I mean he’s a hopeless case otherwise! But
by God’s grace Sahaja Yoga may save him.

00:58:26.914 --> 00:58:30.707
They way it is I mean he’s very, very blunt.

00:58:30.907 --> 00:58:37.481
He cannot seek, he’s very insensitive.
And he carries on all kinds of his malpractices

00:58:37.681 --> 00:58:43.854
thinking that he’s a rare saint ever born.
You see that’s another great quality of Kali Yuga!

00:58:45.402 --> 00:58:51.281
This is the problem. They have no conscience left now to
tell them that this is wrong or that is wrong they’ve killed it.

00:58:51.482 --> 00:58:53.697
Everywhere it is so.

00:58:56.434 --> 00:59:00.330
Tumhi shalid shi mulad ka? (marathi: your kids are in school?)
Yogi: Ho. (yes) Shri Mataji: Achcha (ok).

00:59:04.411 --> 00:59:08.014
Ata dusra prashna (marathi: now another question)

00:59:24.441 --> 00:59:29.266
Yogi: How music works on the five chakras?

00:59:30.774 --> 00:59:33.695
Shri Mataji: You see all these five elements

00:59:33.896 --> 00:59:37.941
are very important in our body and they

00:59:38.141 --> 00:59:41.220
are the body of the chakras
also as I have told you.

00:59:41.421 --> 00:59:44.881
So what happens that, when you sing the music,

00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:51.816
the vibrations can go through the musical
sound and can excite certain chakras.

00:59:52.017 --> 00:59:55.805
You see for example for the
hriday (heart) chakra is very good

00:59:56.005 --> 00:59:59.763
or also for the Vishuddhi chakra it is very good.

00:59:59.963 --> 01:00:02.680
Not for all the
chakras. But certain chakras it does.

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:08.071
But supposing you say a mantra
that’s the sound, with beautiful music

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:11.308
and a realised soul then
it is very effective, you see.

01:00:11.508 --> 01:00:17.376
For example, Ganesha you can
excite him with a beautiful sloka

01:00:17.576 --> 01:00:23.754
if you are a realised soul and if your Ganesha is correct,
you can excite the Ganesha of another person very easily,

01:00:23.977 --> 01:00:30.101
I mean such a person do it. So music,
sound, all these things have an effect and

01:00:30.302 --> 01:00:36.274
we are now using that method very extensively.
But supposing now, we go in a mass meditation and

01:00:36.474 --> 01:00:40.037
many people are there and some
chakra is caught, say Vishuddhi is caught,

01:00:40.238 --> 01:00:43.607
I can correct their Vishuddhi by just
putting My finger on this, like this,

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:51.018
because this has the sound, this is in the chakras, there
is a micro-sound which is carrying the vibrations, you see.

01:00:51.218 --> 01:00:56.297
Actually the part of the vibrations is the
micro-sound also, micro-light, micro-sound

01:00:56.498 --> 01:00:59.023
and you can say all the five elements are
micro there.

01:00:59.223 --> 01:01:03.827
So when I put my finger the micro sound can carry
the rest of them and the person can be corrected.

01:01:04.027 --> 01:01:07.518
We can do it. Specially Vishuddhi.
Very easy to correct Vishuddhi on that.

01:01:07.719 --> 01:01:11.735
You can correct most of the things but
certain things are very easily corrected.

01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:19.910
Vishuddhi, which is responsible for the
sound, made from the sound element.

01:01:21.022 --> 01:01:28.779
As we have seen that water element is very
good for treating people for the lower chakras,

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:36.301
because up to the heart chakra, because the
water and salt can help you for the Nabhi chakra

01:01:36.501 --> 01:01:41.698
and because salt is the earth element

01:01:41.898 --> 01:01:46.636
and what do you call it?
It is essence of the ocean and

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:52.609
the essence of the ocean is in the bhavasagara. So
we can use salt water for clearing the lower chakras.

01:01:52.809 --> 01:02:00.050
We can use light for the eyes because,
this is made out of the prakash – light element.

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:03.987
Like that different things can be done.

01:02:04.964 --> 01:02:12.963
And with these different elements if you use them, you can
make all the dirt or all the obstructions, which are collected,

01:02:13.163 --> 01:02:19.102
in your particular chakra by putting
them back into the same element

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:22.539
and cleansing
them out so the element takes it away.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:28.210
For Mother Earth also, She has so many elements in
Her that She can take away so many of your problems

01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:31.867
which are troubling you, in your being,

01:02:32.068 --> 01:02:37.521
because of some imbalance
of the Mother Earth element.

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:45.829
You see, this is all due to the imbalance of these elements
in you, accumulated more beyond than what you want it.

01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:48.611
That’s why I said, “the extreme of it.”

01:02:51.314 --> 01:02:55.611
Prithvi tattwa (earth element)
is expressed through Shri Ganesh

01:02:55.811 --> 01:02:59.679
and Shri Ganesh is the form of the,

01:02:59.879 --> 01:03:05.374
you can say the purified
principle of the Earth element

01:03:05.733 --> 01:03:09.586
and is the same. I mean,

01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:18.195
in a flute you have two notes,

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:24.067
the first and the last are the same.
In the same way in a human being the seven notes,

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:27.437
the first one is
a Ganesha and the last one is also a Ganesha.

01:03:27.719 --> 01:03:30.167
So these seven notes are the same.

01:03:30.367 --> 01:03:38.048
And these seven notes make the Earth element

01:03:38.248 --> 01:03:44.988
and not completely Earth
element but started with earth element purified.

01:03:45.188 --> 01:03:48.358
When it loses its Earth
element problems completely

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:51.695
it is Parabrahma, I mean it becomes all Brahma.

01:03:51.895 --> 01:03:58.902
Because Earth element is, outside is
the Earth element but inside is dhara,

01:03:59.102 --> 01:04:05.976
is dhara, is dharana – is the power
to sustain, is the power to sustain.

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:11.114
And that power is the purest
form of Earth principle (tattwa).

01:04:12.948 --> 01:04:18.388
So, that you become later on; gradually the whole
Earth element drops down and you become that.

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:22.726
So it is the dharana shakti as they
call it: the power of sustenance.

01:04:23.037 --> 01:04:26.008
Is the Ganesha.

01:04:27.032 --> 01:04:32.102
So, like that, in every chakra you have
a very subtle and subtle-most point.

01:04:32.302 --> 01:04:37.307
And that subtle-most point is the note that

01:04:37.825 --> 01:04:41.144
the Divine is playing at
that point, because every note

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:45.908
has a different frequency, a
different intonation you can call it,

01:04:46.109 --> 01:04:51.755
a different sound, which helps
in the melody of this Universe.

01:04:53.026 --> 01:04:56.348
So, like that, we have seven chakras and the seven
notes.

01:04:56.549 --> 01:05:02.565
And they are different notes but these
notes then create permutations and combinations

01:05:02.765 --> 01:05:09.136
and that is how a chakra gets into a
swara (musical note) and then it becomes a

01:05:09.422 --> 01:05:14.444
a sound, and from a sound it becomes a word,
and from word it becomes a language and

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:20.784
like that it goes on and the same subtle
form starts becoming something else.

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:24.120
For example if I have love for my children:

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.324
what, how I express it? I make a house for them,

01:05:27.524 --> 01:05:33.185
I make a place to live for them, I cook
food for them, I make a bed for them.

01:05:33.385 --> 01:05:36.452
It’s a gross expression
of that subtle love I have.

01:05:36.652 --> 01:05:40.805
In the same way whatever is subtle
within us is expressed outside

01:05:41.006 --> 01:05:44.216
with the help of the elements that are outside,

01:05:44.416 --> 01:05:51.203
to express the subtle through
our gross behaviour or gross

01:05:52.128 --> 01:05:54.844
material things also we do.

01:05:55.045 --> 01:05:58.100
So, it’s the same subtle,
which is expressing outside.

01:05:58.410 --> 01:06:02.811
But then we become so gross
later on that we forget the inner part of it.

01:06:03.011 --> 01:06:05.871
You see for a Mother may create
something, all these things and

01:06:06.072 --> 01:06:09.851
then she becomes so possessive of her children,
she’ll think, “I’ve done so much for my children,” that

01:06:10.051 --> 01:06:12.736
she wouldn’t even think why she has made it!

01:06:12.936 --> 01:06:16.216
She forgets the love part of it and she becomes
nothing but the gross thing.

01:06:16.416 --> 01:06:19.876
She just starts scolding the children,
even for a small thing here and there.

01:06:20.076 --> 01:06:24.247
You see she does this for love, and then she
forgets it. That’s what is an extreme behaviour.

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:28.818
Extreme behaviour means, from the subtle, you get
to the gross and the gross, and the grosser.

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:31.988
Once you become grosser you are dead.

01:06:33.891 --> 01:06:36.891
Ata kai prashna? (Marathi: Now what question?)

01:06:40.428 --> 01:06:45.011
Yogi: (asks question about badhas)

01:06:49.182 --> 01:06:53.710
Shri Mataji: Those who can see badhas are
on the emotional side. They can see the badhas.

01:06:54.031 --> 01:06:57.719
There also you can see two types of people.

01:06:57.919 --> 01:07:04.354
Those who already themselves in badha, they can
see badhas, very clearly; they can see the dead persons.

01:07:04.554 --> 01:07:07.422
Those who are already badha can see
that another person who has got a badha

01:07:07.622 --> 01:07:13.200
because they are in the collective subconscious
themselves, so they can see. And a person the one say,

01:07:14.022 --> 01:07:21.241
he can see the one who, supposing,
who is a drunkard – He can see.

01:07:21.442 --> 01:07:26.386
A person who is drunk can see a badha in another
person because he is a subconscious type, he likes it.

01:07:26.587 --> 01:07:33.217
But some people can achieve a state in an
emotional way that they can see badha clearly.

01:07:33.418 --> 01:07:40.489
If they are realised souls, the emotional state,
people say, the bhakti people can see badha there.

01:07:40.689 --> 01:07:46.069
But even the supra-conscious people
can see a light coming before them,

01:07:46.269 --> 01:07:49.032
they can see somebody standing
before them like a light and then say,

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:54.646
that, “There’s a light coming.” They might
get fragrance or things like that can happen. They can.

01:07:55.149 --> 01:07:59.398
They are called as tanmatras

01:07:59.598 --> 01:08:06.916
is the causal principle of all
the Universe, causal – tanmatras.

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:12.856
Means for Earth the causal principle is fragrance.

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:21.197
So, supposing somebody has done
a lot of search in the field of say,

01:08:21.642 --> 01:08:27.402
earth element, so such
a person can get a lot of fragrance, can;

01:08:29.815 --> 01:08:34.978
It is a variety everywhere created
because of their different searches

01:08:35.178 --> 01:08:37.847
and because of their different seeking.

01:08:51.537 --> 01:08:54.931
You see badha, just say
somebody has a badha or not.

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:59.269
If he has Agya and a heart it’s definitely
a badha.

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:04.055
And you just ask the person to put their hands before
the photograph and he starts shaking. Normally he shakes.

01:09:20.268 --> 01:09:24.260
You see I don’t know how you should make
it out but it’s really easy you can make out the,

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:28.180
cannot put their eyes towards
my photograph. If you ask them to close their

01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:33.411
eyes their eyes will start flickering, hands
will start shaking, eyes will always flicker.

01:09:33.612 --> 01:09:36.873
Slightest... will show on the eyelids like this.

01:09:37.295 --> 01:09:40.910
You see badha, can be of many types.

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:47.116
Some people just have for the time being, some people
have permanent residence. Some have bags full! You see.

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:50.316
So you just can’t say what it will be.

01:10:11.647 --> 01:10:15.044
You just don’t worry about these things.

01:10:17.115 --> 01:10:22.819
You see the thing is people think that there’s only one
type of badha, emotional badha. There can be both types,

01:10:23.019 --> 01:10:28.190
a person who is very
egotistical also is dominated by somebody else.

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:33.651
Abnormal area, abnormal behaviour, who
is not a normal person, can come from anywhere.

01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:09.332
There is no difference
between sunlight and sun, moonlight and moon.

01:11:10.563 --> 01:11:17.373
So there is no difference at all. It is only
the human beings who think there are two stuffs.

01:11:26.898 --> 01:11:31.276
Which is an advaita (non-duality),
which one and the same thing is it.

01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:36.759
For example, now this
bangle is beautifying my hand,

01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:44.400
so what is the difference between
this bangle and the beautification?

01:11:44.832 --> 01:11:47.403
Is the quality of a person.

01:11:51.095 --> 01:11:53.843
Is the quality. It's the,

01:11:55.884 --> 01:11:59.284
we can say the ?? and ??, you can call it.

01:12:01.899 --> 01:12:05.688
You will take out the rest of it and you
will say that this is all useless. It’s not that.

01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:09.559
You see,
in every thing this is all there, it’s one.

01:12:10.732 --> 01:12:15.231
What is the essence of sunlight and sun?
Sun has no meaning without sunlight.

01:12:15.906 --> 01:12:19.102
Sunlight has no meaning without sun.

01:12:21.444 --> 01:12:24.622
It is not essence, it is everything but.

01:12:25.195 --> 01:12:30.379
We can say water and a ice.

01:12:31.499 --> 01:12:34.915
Yogi: Existence and essence,
I mean are just recycled two categories..?

01:12:35.116 --> 01:12:37.151
Shri Mataji: No.
Yogi: No, it's not that.

01:12:37.352 --> 01:12:40.802
Shri Mataji: No, it's about having
wisdom and both having sense.

01:12:41.003 --> 01:12:44.464
There is no difference at all, you see.

01:12:45.067 --> 01:12:50.261
Human beings cannot conceive it, that’s the trouble
with the human mind, because it is an advaita,

01:12:50.461 --> 01:12:54.337
so human beings cannot see it.
They think of two things always.

01:12:55.231 --> 01:12:58.611
You see through perception it is
not possible for you to perceive it,

01:12:58.812 --> 01:13:03.300
but you can understand by analysing. Many
things human beings can’t understand.

01:13:03.531 --> 01:13:08.999
You just cannot, because you have a limited brain,
you have a limited awareness, you have limited love.
