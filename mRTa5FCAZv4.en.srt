1
00:00:42,165 --> 00:00:45,584
Out of tune they are going.

2
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:50,131
They are going out of tune a little bit. 
Let them go in tune, you see?

3
00:00:50,156 --> 00:00:55,598
One should not go in…speak with heart, 
and speak with feelings,

4
00:00:55,623 --> 00:01:03,559
and should not be out of tune. 
They are out of tune, very much.

5
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:07,244
Do it properly. Now.

6
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:32,218
Come along. Let’s have it again.

7
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:42,086
Must say in tune, in proper tune, 
you see?

8
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:46,976
Just without tune if you go out… 
you play and then they should sing.

9
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:58,850
Where are they? Those who 
are singing?

10
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:02,491
They should be there, you see, that’s 
why, they are not in tune with you.

11
00:02:02,516 --> 00:02:07,955
Come here, those who are singing. 
That’s better, that’s the reason.

12
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,627
You must sit with the musicians 
and sing in tune, alright?

13
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:18,944
Not without tune.

14
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,680
Thus vibrations won’t come.

15
00:02:26,674 --> 00:02:31,188
Vibrations are not flowing. 
Is better to sing…

16
00:02:31,802 --> 00:02:36,489
not in tune, better sing like that.

17
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:41,054
They don’t know how to sing it.

18
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:54,550
Who has fixed this?

19
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:01,863
Catching on the Sahasrara.

20
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,365
Make it in Indian tune.

21
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:35,548
So that’s a very not proper way. 
Let her sing,

22
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:38,358
she knows. Let her sing, 
she’ll tell you.

23
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:41,178
You see, the vibrations could not 
My Sahasrara’s caught up.

24
00:03:41,203 --> 00:03:44,440
Sit down, all of you sit down.

25
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,205
These are mantras, this is not song, 
is mantras, you see?

26
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:58,151
Are to be said with deliberations 
and understanding.

27
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:32,661
You see, how it should be sung, 
not that like

28
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:36,321
a tiger is running after you.

29
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:39,763
It's a deliberate thing, is mantras, 
you see?

30
00:07:39,788 --> 00:07:43,047
Everybody has no right to sing 
mantras also.

31
00:07:43,072 --> 00:07:46,405
You must sing with deliberations.

32
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:49,000
Now let us hear how they sing,

33
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:51,385
as I don’t want to catch again 
My Sahasrara.

34
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,118
Now which one, what one is 
they were singing?

35
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,279
What is the one they were singing?

36
00:07:58,304 --> 00:08:04,042
Yogi: The 10 names of Shri Lakshmi. 
Shri Mataji: Ah?

37
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:11,262
Yogi: The 10 names of Shri Lakshmi. 
Or nine…

38
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,699
Now. Do it slowly, steadily and without 
hurrying up.

39
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:20,194
And understanding what 
you are saying.

40
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:27,536
She rides on an elephant, 
not in an aeroplane.

41
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:33,672
Sahaja yogi: Shri Mataji, shall we 
sing it in one part or we can

42
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:36,771
try to sing it in two parts? 
Shri Mataji: No, one part.

43
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:39,586
Two parts is not good. That also 
is wrong. One part.

44
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:42,447
One part and with deliberations, 
see?

45
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:45,235
Every word should be clear cut.

46
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:52,785
Then it is a mantras, you see? These 
are the words which are enlightened,

47
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:59,112
and this is only very few people 
have this Adhikara,

48
00:08:59,137 --> 00:09:04,745
you see - you have, because you are 
sahaja yogis - to sing mantras.

49
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,491
Now let’s have it. Not in parts, 
sing it in one.

SHRI NIRMALA DEVYAI NAMO NAMAH

98
00:13:53,951 --> 00:13:57,917
Good, beautiful, see the vibrations 
started flowing.

99
00:13:57,942 --> 00:14:01,959
And now the meanings you know this.

100
00:14:01,984 --> 00:14:06,605
Now, today when we are doing 
Lakshmi Puja

101
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:14,821
all these are blessings on your 
chakras

102
00:14:15,524 --> 00:14:19,225
which are bestowed upon. So it has 
to be done in such a way

103
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,038
that the deities should be happy 
and you should get all the blessings.

104
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:29,113
See these are mantras. There’s 
a difference between a music and mantra.

105
00:14:29,138 --> 00:14:34,076
The mantras act on your chakras 
and open that part in you

106
00:14:34,101 --> 00:14:38,620
and bestow that blessing of that mantra 
upon you.

107
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:42,531
This is the difference. Alright?

108
00:14:42,556 --> 00:14:44,800
So mantras should never be sung

109
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:50,204
with a speed or just in a very 
superficial way.

110
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:55,177
It has to be very deep with feelings 
and understanding.

111
00:14:55,202 --> 00:14:59,004
Now do you know the meaning 
of all these Lakshmis?

112
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:03,601
Can you tell them or should I 
tell them?

113
00:15:12,485 --> 00:15:16,404
Give Me the page.

114
00:15:45,071 --> 00:15:51,732
Can I have My spectacles please? 
No, I can read.

115
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:59,497
Now first is the Adya Lakshmi. Adya is 
the one who is the Primordial,

116
00:15:59,522 --> 00:16:02,165
Primordial Lakshmi.

117
00:16:02,165 --> 00:16:07,421
As I told you about, that She came 
out of the Sea.

118
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:19,931
So that’s what we call Christ’s Mother 
was called as Mary, Maria,

119
00:16:19,956 --> 00:16:26,510
because She came from Marine. People 
don’t know why she was called as Mary.

120
00:16:26,535 --> 00:16:34,353
My name also is as you know, is Nira, 
meaning coming from water.

121
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:44,975
Then the second one is Vidya Lakshmi. 
She’s the one who teaches you

122
00:16:47,312 --> 00:16:55,965
the technique of handling the Divine 
Power.

123
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:59,783
Now this is to be understood very well. 
What is a Lakshmi?

124
00:16:59,808 --> 00:17:02,885
Lakshmi is graciousness.

125
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:12,094
So She teaches you how to use 
this power with graciousness.

126
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:18,584
Now, this is what is the blessing going 
to you so that you get the power

127
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:22,679
of Adya Lakshmi by which you become 
like water

128
00:17:22,704 --> 00:17:27,974
and what is the water? It has a cleansing 
power and it shines.

129
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:32,517
Without water we cannot exist. 
It’s life.

130
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:39,405
So that’s the first blessing for you is 
that the face shines with Adya Lakshmi,

131
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,477
that you become cleansing

132
00:17:44,156 --> 00:17:51,270
and that you can sink all 
that is material

133
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:55,226
– all that is light can float 
on you.

134
00:17:57,107 --> 00:18:00,708
Now. The Vidya Lakshmi is the one 
as I told you gives you knowledge

135
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:08,044
– knowledge how to handle the Divine 
Power graciously.

136
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:11,340
I’ll give you an example. I’ve seen 
many people

137
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:15,976
when they give bandhans, it’s such 
a crude way, that.

138
00:18:16,001 --> 00:18:19,819
No, it is not to be done. 
It’s a Lakshmi’s blessing.

139
00:18:19,844 --> 00:18:23,871
So how you do it, very carefully. 
You see me, how I give always.

140
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:31,341
I never do that way! I cannot! 
With respect.

141
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:36,895
With grace. She represents the respect 
part of it.

142
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,030
And that you get – that knowledge. 
How to do it gracefully.

143
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:47,389
Everything to be done gracefully 
– in a manner that looks gracious.

144
00:18:47,414 --> 00:18:51,154
See, some people who talk have 
no grace.

145
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:54,030
Some people who give knowledge 
of Sahaja Yoga

146
00:18:54,055 --> 00:19:00,481
also have no grace and they talk 
in a disgraceful manner.

147
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:06,313
So all the grace – how to use

148
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:11,171
the knowledge of the Divine is given 
by Vidya Lakshmi.

149
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:18,185
Now Saubhagya Lakshmi. She’s the one 
who gives you good fortune.

150
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:23,342
Good fortune doesn’t mean money, 
but it means the grace of money.

151
00:19:23,367 --> 00:19:28,138
Many people have money but it’s 
like money on a donkey.

152
00:19:28,974 --> 00:19:32,763
You do not find any grace 
in that person.

153
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:36,224
Or it doesn’t also mean, 
Saubhagya doesn’t mean

154
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:40,662
only money – it means 
all the good luck.

155
00:19:40,687 --> 00:19:44,827
All the good luck in everything in a very 
gracious manner, is this.

156
00:19:44,852 --> 00:19:48,596
To you the blessings so that you 
also are blessed

157
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:54,603
as well as those people who’ll meet you 
will be blessed, with Saubhagya.

158
00:19:55,827 --> 00:20:03,370
Amruta Lakshmi. Amrut means the one 
that is the nectar.

159
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:07,425
If you take that you will not die. 
Means eternity.

160
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:12,740
So She’s the one who gives you 
the life of eternity.

161
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:18,040
Gruha Lakshmi. Gruha Lakshmi is 
the deity of the family

162
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:22,780
- the one who is the deity of the family. 
Now, any housewife

163
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:27,644
need not be Gruha Lakshmi. 
She can be a shrew.

164
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:30,040
She can be a horrid thing.

165
00:20:30,065 --> 00:20:33,276
The deity of the household

166
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:39,210
– if She resides in you, then you are 
a Gruha Lakshmi, otherwise you are not.

167
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:47,737
Then there is Raja Lakshmi. She is 
the one who gives grace to the kings.

168
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:53,703
If the kings behave like servants, 
then they are not called as kings.

169
00:20:53,728 --> 00:21:00,717
They have to behave in a dignified manner. 
The dignity, the majesty of the king

170
00:21:00,742 --> 00:21:04,659
comes from the Raja Lakshmi 
in him.

171
00:21:04,684 --> 00:21:08,053
But a sahaja yogi need not 
be training.

172
00:21:08,078 --> 00:21:13,014
He walks very straight in a very 
stately manner.

173
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,656
In his movements he’s stately. He’s very 
majestic in handling people.

174
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:21,634
He’s very gracious in doing 
anything

175
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:26,278
in such a manner that people think, 
“Oh, here comes a king.”

176
00:21:27,146 --> 00:21:31,392
Satya Lakshmi. That is,

177
00:21:32,578 --> 00:21:37,608
that you get the awareness of truth, 
but apart from that

178
00:21:37,633 --> 00:21:39,857
– the awareness of truth is there

179
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:46,722
but to put this truth forward 
in a gracious manner.

180
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:52,631
Not to, “Now this is the truth 
– have it!”. Not like that!

181
00:21:52,656 --> 00:21:55,420
Don’t have to hit people with 
the truth.

182
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:59,727
You have to put it in a flower and give 
it to them. That is Satya Lakshmi.

183
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:05,139
Of course the all Lakshmi Tattwas 
are

184
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:11,361
the parasympathetic powers 
within us

185
00:22:11,386 --> 00:22:16,457
but they are actually expressed 
in our brain.

186
00:22:16,482 --> 00:22:20,429
Brain is the Virata.

187
00:22:20,454 --> 00:22:25,622
Is the Vishnu when He becomes 
the Virat – the Akbar.

188
00:22:25,647 --> 00:22:32,056
So all His powers are, specially these 
powers are in the brain.

189
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:37,276
So, the brain itself spontaneously 
behaves

190
00:22:37,301 --> 00:22:45,670
in such a manner that people think that 
this is a special type of a personality.

191
00:22:45,695 --> 00:22:48,445
Then we have got

192
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,986
Bhogya Lakshmi, by which we know 
how to enjoy.

193
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:03,304
A sahaja yogi always knows how 
to enjoy everything.

194
00:23:03,938 --> 00:23:06,514
He doesn’t…

195
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:18,130
The sahaja yogi is never worried type. 
Anything he can enjoy.

196
00:23:18,155 --> 00:23:24,357
Once, we climbed a very steep place, 
called Palitana.

197
00:23:24,382 --> 00:23:30,691
It was about 6 miles above – like that - 
as if walking for 6 miles – climbed up.

198
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:34,579
I reached there and saw the beautiful 
carvings.

199
00:23:34,604 --> 00:23:37,171
I was not tired at all when I saw 
the carvings.

200
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:39,266
And I was telling my son-in-law, 
“See

201
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:43,135
every tail of the elephants is made 
differently.”

202
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:49,676
He says: “Mother I’m panting here. How 
can you see the tails of the elephants?”

203
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:55,390
It is because I can enjoy. You should 
be able to enjoy anything.

204
00:23:55,415 --> 00:23:59,743
Now supposing you see something 
absurd – ridiculous.

205
00:23:59,768 --> 00:24:05,836
Then you should laugh and enjoy. This is 
a ridiculous thing, you see? Is absurd.

206
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:10,508
But one should not get angry with somebody 
because somebody is absurd or funny.

207
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:16,180
But should make it enjoyable.

208
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:20,808
So that is the greatest, I think 
one of the greatest blessings

209
00:24:20,833 --> 00:24:24,607
- that She gives you the power 
to enjoy things.

210
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:28,472
Otherwise whatever you may try people 
don’t enjoy anything

211
00:24:28,497 --> 00:24:32,980
because they have become so ego-oriented 
that nothing goes into their heads.

212
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:37,074
They have to be tickled here 
with the electrodes.

213
00:24:39,088 --> 00:24:44,249
Yoga Lakshmi – the one who gives 
you Yoga.

214
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:48,552
That power is within you. That is 
the power of Lakshmi within you,

215
00:24:48,577 --> 00:24:54,258
means you give others the yoga.

216
00:24:54,894 --> 00:25:00,358
Now when you give the power

217
00:25:01,821 --> 00:25:07,276
of yoga to others, I mean when you use 
your power of yoga,

218
00:25:07,301 --> 00:25:15,089
then you don’t behave like a monkey 
or a donkey

219
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:19,465
or a horse, but you do it 
with grace.

220
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:24,205
Do it in such a manner that it is 
very gracious.

221
00:25:24,978 --> 00:25:30,837
That is what you call (searches English 
term for word in Sanskrit)...

222
00:25:36,942 --> 00:25:41,793
Sahaja yogi: Gently? 
Shri Mataji: Ah. In a gentle,

223
00:25:41,818 --> 00:25:46,025
dignified, majestic way.

224
00:25:46,951 --> 00:25:50,345
Gentle, dignified, majestic way

225
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:55,222
– three words (in English) for one word 
(in Sanskrit). So this is what it is.

226
00:25:55,247 --> 00:25:58,054
And now when you have sung it 
in this manner,

227
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,761
this power has been bestowed 
upon you.

228
00:26:01,786 --> 00:26:06,614
Now even if you want you cannot 
behave indecently.

229
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:10,358
You are fixed.

230
00:26:12,018 --> 00:26:15,154
Alright. Thank you very much. 
So mantras should be said

231
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:21,379
deliberately with understanding. Like 
the one you have made one poem – song.

232
00:26:21,404 --> 00:26:24,268
In that, you sing in a proper way.

233
00:26:24,293 --> 00:26:27,410
Never just go on: “Shri–this, 
Shri-that, Shri…”.

234
00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:32,423
No, no, no. It’s like taking a role call 
of the Lakshmi’s,

235
00:26:32,448 --> 00:26:36,190
“Are you there, are you there, 
are you there”?. Like that.

236
00:26:37,193 --> 00:26:42,783
So now do it in a very deliberate manner 
and with due respect and graciousness

237
00:26:42,808 --> 00:26:47,817
because specially with the Lakshmi’s thing 
you have to be extremely gracious.

238
00:26:47,842 --> 00:26:55,460
You have to use very gentle words 
and gentle tunes and gentle notes.

239
00:26:55,485 --> 00:26:56,808
All right.
