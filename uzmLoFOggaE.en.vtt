00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.690
So we’ll have the experience now.

00:00:05.727 --> 00:00:07.533
It will take about five minutes

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.150
for you because if all the chakras are discussed

00:00:10.192 --> 00:00:12.444
already the attention is on that.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.021
Is very simple to put your hands towards Me.

00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:21.301
Sahaja Yogi : Everyone steps out his shoes, will you ?

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.026

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.137
[to the Sahaja Yogi] You’ve done a good job Ah

00:00:33.215 --> 00:00:36.224
Just put your hands towards Me.

00:00:36.738 --> 00:00:39.152
Just like this.

00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:43.121

Now, left hand towards Me and right hand towards the Mother Earth.

00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:14.558
We’ll give you a balance. You need not close your eyes just now, let’s see.

00:01:14.606 --> 00:01:18.560
Put your right hand towards the Mother Earth.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:23.346
As I told you yesterday left side is our conditioning,

00:01:23.446 --> 00:01:26.486
conditioning, subconscious and collective subconscious,

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.909
very much at work here.

00:01:28.974 --> 00:01:33.093
But also is an emotional side.

00:01:43.716 --> 00:01:49.236
Now put your right hand towards Me and left hand towards the sky.

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:53.355
Right hand towards Me, right hand towards Me like this.

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:57.517
Sahaja Yogi : Put your left hand towards the back.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.890
Shri Mataji : Are you feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:17.600
You are already thoughtless, there’s no thought,

00:02:17.683 --> 00:02:21.746
but just see if you are feeling the cool breeze.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.040
Sahaja Yogi : It’s better [inaudible].

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.520
Shri Mataji : Much better

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.471
Are you?

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:34.667
Let’s see.

[Shri Mataji blows in the mike].

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.490
All right?

00:03:41.758 --> 00:03:45.403
Are you feeling any cool breeze in the hand?

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:50.383
All right, now put your left hand on top of your head,

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.329

00:03:56.898 --> 00:03:59.167
Are you feeling?

00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:01.678
It’s a very subtle thing.

00:04:03.913 --> 00:04:05.913
Are you?

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:09.289
Pay attention.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.550
Shri Mataji : [to the Sahaja Yogi]. Working out ; good?

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.040
All right. Now, change over.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.500
See the left hand, with the right hand. Just pay attention there, see.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.310
Believe that you are the Spirit.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.157
So just you have to say in your heart: “I am the Spirit”.

00:04:35.204 --> 00:04:38.974
In your heart. Say it seven times, it will work out.

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.706
Releasing.

00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:56.441

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.266
Are you feeling the heat coming out?

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.750
Little heat.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.710
All right, now turn, change, see now.

00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:11.004
Right Swadhishthan.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.740

Feel it. Just put your hands like this.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.112
It’s good.

00:05:51.514 --> 00:05:55.834
You are all thoughtless. If you see, there’s no thought in your mind.

00:05:59.314 --> 00:06:01.594
And complete silence.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.074

You may not realize today but you’ll realize it very soon.

00:06:19.702 --> 00:06:24.262
Ah, strong.

00:06:25.424 --> 00:06:28.824
Have faith in yourself, that’s the main thing.

00:06:32.984 --> 00:06:35.754
It’s beautiful.
