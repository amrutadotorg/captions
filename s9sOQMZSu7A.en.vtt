00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:13.354
Once, His Father said that

00:00:13.434 --> 00:00:16.487
"Whosoever goes round the Mother Earth first,

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:20.220
I'll give that person a present."

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.254
So another brother, Kartikeya,

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:28.521
He had a nice vahana, a nice vehicle -

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:31.254
was a peacock,

00:00:31.334 --> 00:00:37.434
while Ganesha had just a little rat, a mouse,

00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:40.920
and He could never have competed with Him.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.020
So He said, "Who is greater than My Mother?

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.987
She is the greatest of all.

00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:47.534
What is this Mother Earth or anyone?

00:00:48.067 --> 00:00:50.120
She can create so many Mother Earths like that."

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.087
So He just went round Her and He got the prize,

00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:57.200
and this Kartikeya was still flying.

00:00:59.434 --> 00:01:04.387
So that is what it is, to understand the auspiciousness.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:26.000
Kartikeya represents the great, we can
say the captain or leader of all the ganas,

00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:32.601
of all the, like a Commander-in-Chief.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.187
Ganesha is the King but He is the Commander-in-Chief

00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:47.920
and because German character
is to be in command of everything

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.053
we are going to have this puja where

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:57.254
the men will be in command of their spirits

00:01:57.334 --> 00:02:00.120
and their manly qualities

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.120
and women will be in command of their womanly qualities.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.487
To be in command is different from to be a master.

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:16.300
Master owns it, a commander does not own it.

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:23.120
He does not own it, that is also lost.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.421
Possession is also lost, we just command it.

00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:31.220
And that is the state we have to come to now,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:39.120
from Ganesha state to the state of Kartikeya.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.320
The other way round:
Ganesha is nice, he’s the King,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.254
very nicely sitting down with all the powers, alright?

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:51.287
Innocence is there,

00:02:51.367 --> 00:03:00.133
but Kartikeya’s the one who commands innocence,

00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:05.267
gives you a power of that commandment.

00:03:06.534 --> 00:03:08.154
He commands.

00:03:08.234 --> 00:03:15.521
After the Guru Puja it's better that we
should have the power to command others

00:03:15.601 --> 00:03:22.087
and that commanding spirit comes in the men

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:27.920
through their talking, through their dynamism,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.020
through their personal achievements;

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.053
for the women through their loving power,

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:41.421
through their forbearance, through their gracious behaviour,

00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:45.254
forgiveness, compassion.

00:03:45.334 --> 00:03:49.554
So let us develop that today, that we can command it,

00:03:49.634 --> 00:03:52.601
means it’s not that what we have

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:56.354
but in a position we are to command.

00:03:56.434 --> 00:03:59.987
I hope you understand what is Kartikeya.

00:04:03.367 --> 00:04:12.987
On the 14th day, [Narakasura]
was killed by Shadanana, Kartikeya,

00:04:13.067 --> 00:04:19.334
was the son of Parvati and Shankar

00:04:21.367 --> 00:04:28.154
who was a very powerful expression of Rudra Shakti,

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:33.354
is that He is the killing power of God.

00:04:33.434 --> 00:04:40.100
And He was created specially
for this purpose, to kill Narakasura.

00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:51.467
Then the - this one was, this rakshasa,

00:04:53.601 --> 00:04:59.953
was such a menace and he had ruined so many people’s lives.

00:05:00.033 --> 00:05:09.000
He has done such a havoc and
people didn’t know how to find protection.

00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:17.154
That time, when Narakasura was killed by the Shakti

00:05:17.234 --> 00:05:24.187
in the form of Shadanana, Kartikeya,
there was celebration all over.

00:05:24.267 --> 00:05:26.953
People celebrated the next night

00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:32.521
and the next night was the darkest
night of the whole year, is tonight.

00:05:32.601 --> 00:05:42.501
The 15th day of the waning moon
is called as amavasya [new moon].

00:05:43.467 --> 00:05:46.521
So this is the darkest night.

00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:50.920
There are always dark nights every month once,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.920
but this is the darkest night of the whole year

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.953
and just before this Narakasura was killed.

00:05:59.033 --> 00:06:10.534
And all the lights are put in the
house and lots of these lamps are burnt.

00:06:13.501 --> 00:06:20.554
Of course electricity lights are
different from these, as you know,

00:06:20.634 --> 00:06:24.387
that they burn badhas all the time.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:30.487
So, after the death of Narakasura,

00:06:30.567 --> 00:06:33.154
he had a big army of his own

00:06:33.234 --> 00:06:39.154
when he was very powerful and he had hypnotized many people,

00:06:39.234 --> 00:06:43.387
so to get rid of the residual ones altogether,

00:06:43.467 --> 00:06:52.454
they lighted all these lamps, so that all those devils

00:06:52.534 --> 00:06:59.354
who were still roaming about should all be burnt off;

00:06:59.434 --> 00:07:04.521
and you can understand in Sahaja Yoga how a lamp burns

00:07:04.601 --> 00:07:10.220
and how a badha is taken away by a lamp.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.087
But still all the lights of the house must be lighted.

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:18.053
Will you go and light all the lights in the house?

00:07:18.133 --> 00:07:23.554
Outside and inside, there should
be, everywhere there should be light.

00:07:23.634 --> 00:07:29.554
No room should be kept in darkness
because they hide in the darkness.

00:07:29.634 --> 00:07:33.120
So no corner should be dark.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:43.020
Then the fourteenth day is the
day when Narakasura was killed.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:49.421
You know Narakasura has
taken his birth and he’s to be killed:

00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:54.454
the Sahaja Yogis are going to kill him.

00:07:54.534 --> 00:07:58.421
You have to come up to a point
and definitely he can be killed.

00:07:58.501 --> 00:08:02.254
When Kartikeya is awakened within you he can be killed.

00:08:02.334 --> 00:08:10.287
But for that you have to be just like gold, untarnishable.

00:08:10.367 --> 00:08:13.421
You need strong people to do that.

00:08:13.501 --> 00:08:21.220
A sword that can kill him has to come out of your metals.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:27.033
Then Narakasura can be killed.
He is one of the worst possible asura.

00:08:27.601 --> 00:08:29.567
5 Gyaneshwara Incarnation of Kartikeya

00:08:30.467 --> 00:08:39.154
Gyaneshwara, such a great
personality, such a great writer, poet,

00:08:39.234 --> 00:08:43.554
I mean he was everything, so beautifully he has written.

00:08:43.634 --> 00:08:50.287
But at the age of twenty-three he took
his samadhi, means he went into a cave,

00:08:50.367 --> 00:08:53.254
and closed the cave and died there.

00:08:53.334 --> 00:09:00.320
Must have been tired and fed up with
the surroundings of ignorant people,

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.454
and that's why he did.

00:09:02.534 --> 00:09:11.421
So you can imagine a person like
Gyaneshwara, who was the incarnation of Kartikeya,

00:09:11.501 --> 00:09:17.154
had to recede into the world of the dead

00:09:17.234 --> 00:09:23.187
because he couldn't bear it any
more the way they were torturing them.

00:09:23.267 --> 00:09:32.920
They tortured him so much, saying
that he is the son of a sanyasi and he has

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.987
I mean, it's like this: “son of a
sanyasi” means he is no good,

00:09:40.067 --> 00:09:46.521
he is absolutely like an illegitimate
child; and he is ill-treated to such an extent,

00:09:46.601 --> 00:09:51.487
he didn't even have shoes to wear in that heat of India.

00:09:51.567 --> 00:09:54.287
He used to walk bare feet.

00:09:54.367 --> 00:10:00.020
And his sister, brother, who were
great scholars, who were great saints,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.187
great incarnations, all of themself.

00:10:03.267 --> 00:10:07.087
As a result he wanted just to disappear,

00:10:07.167 --> 00:10:14.320
and he made a beautiful way of doing
it, that he told them that “I have to go,”

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:20.521
and he took leave from them and went inside his cave,

00:10:20.601 --> 00:10:23.634
and got his samadhi.

00:10:32.033 --> 00:10:39.267
That is known as “Brahma tattva”. It’s known
as the essence of Brahma, “Brahma tattva”.

00:10:40.167 --> 00:10:43.953
And Christ was made of that.

00:10:44.033 --> 00:10:47.154
Completely embodied, imagine.

00:10:47.234 --> 00:10:50.601
His body was also made “pranav”.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:58.053
It was not made at the time when He was to be
born. It was made thousands and thousands of years

00:10:58.133 --> 00:11:01.987
much before as Mahavishnu.

00:11:02.067 --> 00:11:06.487
First, He was made as Ganesha and
then Ganesha was made into Mahavishnu,

00:11:06.567 --> 00:11:11.287
in which Kumara’s body also was
made. See, Kumara also was brought in.

00:11:11.367 --> 00:11:15.320
Actually, it is more Kartikeya than Ganesha is.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:20.120
In the Christ, it is more Kartikeya.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.053
Through vibrations [Hindi] omkara.

00:11:24.133 --> 00:11:26.521
You know any Kartikeya, Christine?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

00:11:26.601 --> 00:11:32.300
Shri Mataji: You know.
See it. Better.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:42.421
We have got one, in the Finchley if you go,
there is a big one. We have put a statue of Kartikeya.

00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:50.287
We’ll see the vibrations of that. He was
specially created to kill a very bad demon.

00:11:50.367 --> 00:11:56.087
And his power was put into Ganesha,
you see. And that is how Christ was created.

00:11:56.167 --> 00:12:00.421
And that too Radha created Him,
re-created Him. I mean sort of, they used those.

00:12:00.501 --> 00:12:03.454
First of all, they evolved these
people and then they put them together.

00:12:03.534 --> 00:12:07.187
There are eleven rudras in Christ. Eleven rudras.

00:12:07.267 --> 00:12:11.320
Eleven powers of destruction He has got. Eleven powers.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:16.053
Which at the end of the world,
He will take them. Eleven rudras.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.167
Greatness [of Christ] cannot be described in words.

00:12:28.167 --> 00:12:34.033
As a child, as a son, He is the giver of joy.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:43.634
One cannot describe how He
looked after His mother, it's impossible.

00:12:48.634 --> 00:12:52.100
No words can describe

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:58.421
the understanding of Christ for His Mother,

00:12:58.501 --> 00:13:03.454
His love, His gentleness, His care,

00:13:03.534 --> 00:13:10.634
His devotion, dedication, His Shraddha cannot be described.

00:13:13.467 --> 00:13:22.200
And you know that He came as an evolved Shri Ganesh.

00:13:24.334 --> 00:13:29.454
At the back He is Shri Ganesh, in front He's Kartikeya,

00:13:29.534 --> 00:13:33.234
very powerful, eleven Rudras.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.200
And this

00:13:42.386 --> 00:13:47.187
has given Him the highest position.

00:13:51.334 --> 00:13:54.534
This is Kartikeya.

00:13:57.067 --> 00:13:58.454
Hmmm!

00:13:58.534 --> 00:14:02.053
This is the fire of Christ.

00:14:02.133 --> 00:14:06.087
This is the one that is going to
come. Really. The fire of Christ.

00:14:06.167 --> 00:14:08.421
The destroying power, Rudras.

00:14:08.501 --> 00:14:12.267
This is one of the Rudras of Christ.
