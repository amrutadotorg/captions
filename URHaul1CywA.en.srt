00:03:59,547 --> 00:04:04,626
﻿Adi Shakti Puja, Detachment, Rahuri (India), 11 December 1988.

2
00:04:05,347 --> 00:04:09,151
Puja has to start at the time, when it has to start

3
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:13,862
I’ve been waiting and waiting and waiting,

4
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:20,069
then I realised that today is a very good time

5
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:28,598
according to the calendar; but it is not in the morning,

6
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,198
so it had to be the third day of the moon

7
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,470
and as the moon is changing its phases in the day time,

8
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:40,269
we had to wait till it started. I think,

9
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:47,669
all these things have happened, of the theft and everything has happened, perhaps,

10
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,748
to delay the Puja up to the point where it should start.

11
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:56,127
So in Sahaja Yoga we all go beyond time

12
00:04:56,327 --> 00:04:59,019
and we don't have to worry about the timing;

13
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:01,723
only when it's a formal function or something,

14
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:06,371
because the people are formal and they don't understand our styles.

15
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:09,865
So we have to be present there at right time,

16
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:13,608
otherwise we should just allow the time to take its own course

17
00:05:13,808 --> 00:05:18,613
and we should move in our own way.

18
00:05:22,256 --> 00:05:32,867
Now for our travel and this tour, we have to realise

19
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:38,819
that we are here to achieve

20
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,265
a certain amount of height in our detachment,

21
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:56,613
we have to rise into the realm of our state,

22
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,951
while the circumstances around us,

23
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:07,615
they're surrounding us and they should not make us unhappy,

24
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:13,500
or biased, or we should not react to them,

25
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:20,821
on the contrary we should try to rise above that

26
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:27,929
if there are no events of mishaps.

27
00:06:28,945 --> 00:06:34,009
Then you cannot see the surmounting quality of the Divine.

28
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:40,986
If the surmounting quality of The Divine has to be seen,

29
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:44,635
we have to see the obstructions.

30
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:52,940
For example, if there is the flow of the water going on

31
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,738
and it is smoothly moving,

32
00:06:56,938 --> 00:07:01,723
there's no happening as you call the ghatana,

33
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:06,834
there is no happening, but if there is a stone,

34
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:09,418
then the water splashes against it,

35
00:07:09,618 --> 00:07:15,660
creates a beauty and surpasses it,

36
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:24,251
this is the sign of Divine surmounting all the difficulties

37
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:28,483
that are supposed to be there.

38
00:07:29,388 --> 00:07:32,040
Now we are proceeding to Puna

39
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,386
and where we will be having a proper session

40
00:07:36,586 --> 00:07:38,894
also for marriages and all that,

41
00:07:39,094 --> 00:07:42,191
we will have to take a firm decision,

42
00:07:42,391 --> 00:07:46,616
I must speak about it today,

43
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:51,992
that the steadiness of the mind is very important for the marriages.

44
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:56,904
If you have certain concepts

45
00:07:57,104 --> 00:08:04,190
and if you are whimsical, it's better you don't get married,

46
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:08,983
because that's not found in Indian character,

47
00:08:09,178 --> 00:08:12,916
once they decide for marriage they are married forever.

48
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:16,468
But if the mind is still wavering, going up and down,

49
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:23,210
it's a trick of the mind that wants to play tricks with others and enjoys,

50
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,526
it is a sign of ego.

51
00:08:26,727 --> 00:08:33,043
Absolutely a sign of ego and then you start playing games,

52
00:08:33,243 --> 00:08:36,837
you enjoy it, "yes, no, yes, no",

53
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,182
you go on enjoying those games

54
00:08:40,382 --> 00:08:42,988
and later on you play into it so much that your marriages

55
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:45,699
can never be happy or successful,

56
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,196
that means you are not yet matured for marriage.

57
00:08:49,397 --> 00:08:51,689
For marriage you are to be matured.

58
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:54,705
But one of the reasons for this I find in the west is,

59
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:58,600
that you have had no training at all,

60
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:02,876
parents have never told you how to behave

61
00:09:03,077 --> 00:09:06,018
towards your husband, towards your wife,

62
00:09:06,218 --> 00:09:08,573
how to make a marriage successful,

63
00:09:08,773 --> 00:09:11,706
that is a very important event

64
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:18,250
and that we should try to establish ourselves in the marriage system,

65
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:25,500
instead of that, we use it as a nice trick playing ground,

66
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:29,657
we miss the point, who is the loser?

67
00:09:29,857 --> 00:09:33,423
If you go on playing tricks like this

68
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:37,762
and playing with your ego, whatever you may do,

69
00:09:37,963 --> 00:09:41,700
whatever type of marriages you'll have,

70
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:44,797
you can never be happy. Now in the west, as you know,

71
00:09:44,997 --> 00:09:50,529
I lead another life also and every person I have met,

72
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,309
every person whatever country they may come,

73
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:58,606
nobody seems to be happy in their marriage, is very surprising.

74
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:04,067
it seems every wife finds something wrong with the husband,

75
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:07,050
the husband finds something wrong with the wife

76
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,323
and they have funny miserable faces,

77
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:15,750
they don't look like married people, but as if like criminals,

78
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,867
or something has really gone wrong with them.

79
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:22,159
There's no smile on their face, they look horrid,

80
00:10:22,184 --> 00:10:24,890
because they have missed the point,

81
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,604
marriage is to be enjoyed, is for your enjoyment.

82
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:39,231
Supposing one gives you ambrosia, Amrut as they call it

83
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:44,970
and then you start playing trick with it. Who is the loser?

84
00:10:45,736 --> 00:10:52,823
So must know that we have to achieved that maturity

85
00:10:53,374 --> 00:10:59,005
and enjoy that love, basically if something is very wrong,

86
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:05,111
or if there's no possibility of a proper marriage,

87
00:11:05,136 --> 00:11:09,207
in Sahaja Yoga we have arrangement, to give it up,

88
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:11,442
you can change your wife, change your husband,

89
00:11:11,642 --> 00:11:15,609
no problem, but there must be some reason behind it,

90
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:21,522
just for fun's sake, if you want to spoil your life.

91
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,662
I'll try my level best to tell you,

92
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:27,128
that don't spoil your life and of the other person.

93
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:31,831
But people enjoy sometimes, spoiling somebody lives

94
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:33,975
when it comes to the ego part,

95
00:11:34,175 --> 00:11:37,917
they themselves cannot enjoy, dog in the manger policy,

96
00:11:38,118 --> 00:11:41,756
dog in the manger cannot eat the grass,

97
00:11:41,781 --> 00:11:46,472
but barks at any bull that comes to eat it, it's like this,

98
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:51,141
neither they will enjoy, nor they will allow others to enjoy

99
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:54,452
and when such stupid couples are there,

100
00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:57,463
I have such a headache all the time, reconciling them,

101
00:11:57,488 --> 00:12:00,277
talking to them, asking them,

102
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,882
I mean it becomes a marriage bureau for me.

103
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:06,682
And sometimes I reach such a conclusion:

104
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:10,325
no more marriages in Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it!

105
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:15,281
Actually what have I to gain out of it? This nobody tries to understand,

106
00:12:15,702 --> 00:12:17,736
what I am trying is to make you happy

107
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:19,963
to get you good husbands and good wives,

108
00:12:20,163 --> 00:12:22,260
that you should have good relationships,

109
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:26,206
you should have great people on this Earth, to be born,

110
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:29,028
that we should have a society

111
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:33,004
which is beyond all these nonsensical societies

112
00:12:33,204 --> 00:12:37,575
which is so great that we can create a homogenous family

113
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:41,940
among ourselves of purity and of holiness,

114
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:44,746
instead of that, for petty nonsensical things

115
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:49,148
if there's a fight going on, one gets really fed up.

116
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:53,563
Of course one has to try.

117
00:12:54,964 --> 00:12:57,864
But if you are bent upon cutting your noses,

118
00:12:58,064 --> 00:13:02,776
how can I go on clipping them back?

119
00:13:02,977 --> 00:13:08,308
It's an eternal problem, if you marry your say, 75 people,

120
00:13:08,508 --> 00:13:12,618
you have the enjoyment of it. Now if it's a, say,

121
00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:18,875
a ocean of, Indian Ocean say for example,

122
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:23,535
but then you get the Pacific Ocean back on your head

123
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:29,182
with all the cries and weeping and shouting and screaming

124
00:13:29,382 --> 00:13:33,714
and all sorts of nonsense that going on.

125
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:39,260
So I again say that, now we are going to Puna

126
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:43,395
where all the marriages are going to be confirmed,

127
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:46,330
if you go on like this there's no end to it,

128
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:49,327
also those people who come for marriages

129
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:53,901
and deny it twice, third time I don't ask them,

130
00:13:54,102 --> 00:13:58,533
because it's a joke going on.

131
00:14:00,046 --> 00:14:04,330
You do not know how many nights I have spent selecting people,

132
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,895
as it is you are from twenty five, thirty countries.

133
00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:12,879
Yesterday you saw that, you have different conditionings,

134
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:16,462
different styles, different everything,

135
00:14:17,038 --> 00:14:20,315
heights different, ages different, faces different,

136
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,678
aptitudes different.

137
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:28,288
So combine all these things, so very difficult,

138
00:14:28,488 --> 00:14:31,491
sometimes I think if you are overeducated,

139
00:14:31,691 --> 00:14:34,031
them better to give you a simple woman,

140
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,436
so that your little pressure is reduced, you can share

141
00:14:37,637 --> 00:14:41,559
with her but if you are equally educated people,

142
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,591
then both the heads may be...

143
00:14:53,132 --> 00:14:57,916
So I have to think of many things and of vibrations,

144
00:14:58,116 --> 00:15:00,780
but somehow or other you can defy

145
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:03,561
and you try to defy it, alright doesnt matter,

146
00:15:03,762 --> 00:15:07,153
but who is the loser is the point,

147
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:10,262
today I had to speak to you about this, because in Sahaj

148
00:15:10,463 --> 00:15:14,294
we have to take the way it comes as it comes,

149
00:15:14,694 --> 00:15:18,470
whatever comes in our way we should take it.

150
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,081
We should not sort of say, I have fallen in love.

151
00:15:21,281 --> 00:15:26,687
There's nobody falls in love, it rises in love in Sahaja Yoga.

152
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:38,051
That is some funny idea, that one must fall in love;

153
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:45,042
because you see that means you must do something sinful,

154
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,100
or something absurd. So many people have told me,

155
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,623
"Mother I have not fallen in love with her."

156
00:15:50,823 --> 00:15:53,477
How can you fall in love, you fall into some ditch,

157
00:15:53,677 --> 00:16:00,670
or you may fall into some river of something like that.

158
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:06,050
I didn't understand how do you fall in love, it's a solid stuff.

159
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:17,503
So this absurd idea of falling in love has to be given up,

160
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:23,519
if it means that you have felt the love,

161
00:16:23,719 --> 00:16:32,017
or if it means you have the sensitivity of feeling the love

162
00:16:32,042 --> 00:16:35,029
or something I can understand, I'm a little explanatory,

163
00:16:35,237 --> 00:16:39,728
but this falling in love business has been going on and on and on.

164
00:16:39,928 --> 00:16:41,867
Now I would request you that in Sahaja Yoga

165
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:47,051
we cancel this terminology.

166
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:54,928
So problems of marriages should not arise in Sahaja Yoga,

167
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:58,945
you have chance for one month to decide for yourself

168
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:04,372
and to find out for yourself. Little bit adjustments and understanding

169
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:09,607
can create such a beautiful world for you.

170
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:15,077
It's just waiting there, but suddenly you decide on some spot,

171
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:19,494
suddenly you're alright I find, at the spur of the moment

172
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,698
I find suddenly you say: "No", I say: "What's this?"

173
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:26,292
The horse was going alright suddenly what has happened?

174
00:17:26,317 --> 00:17:30,421
it has turned round? One can understand a horse,

175
00:17:30,622 --> 00:17:33,624
but I can't understand human beings.

176
00:17:33,825 --> 00:17:39,763
So this whimsical behaviour suddenly,

177
00:17:39,964 --> 00:17:44,614
can be very injurious to the growth of Sahaja Yoga.

178
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,944
Whenever I go to England there's a list of people

179
00:17:48,144 --> 00:17:50,386
from all over the country,

180
00:17:50,587 --> 00:17:53,667
this marriage has gone rotten, that has gone rotten,

181
00:17:53,859 --> 00:17:57,308
that has gone rotten, while I'm boasting to everyone

182
00:17:57,341 --> 00:17:59,986
that Sahaja Yoga marriages never fail.

183
00:18:00,011 --> 00:18:02,777
I know it's not true,

184
00:18:02,802 --> 00:18:07,352
but whatever I say is a Mantra, ultimately it becomes the truth.

185
00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:12,284
So time will come when no marriages will fail,

186
00:18:12,484 --> 00:18:16,428
but you have to join hands with me and co-operate

187
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:20,519
and should understand, how much I have worked hard

188
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:25,331
to bring about these events.

189
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:29,146
And marriages should not make you happy or unhappy,

190
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:34,565
because to marry is not the ultimate in life.

191
00:18:34,766 --> 00:18:37,830
But it happens after marriage people get lost,

192
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,205
they don't come to Sahaja Yoga, after that, we are

193
00:18:40,405 --> 00:18:44,421
enjoying our honeymoon for the last three years.

194
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:48,252
Wonderful Sahaja Yogis who are leaders suddenly get lost,

195
00:18:48,452 --> 00:18:51,900
that also may be a fall in love maybe, I don't know,

196
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,611
but this kind of nonsense, even if it is one or two

197
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:59,819
its such a headache.

198
00:19:01,604 --> 00:19:05,416
And I really don't know how to solve these problems,

199
00:19:05,617 --> 00:19:09,559
because I think there's no problem at all,

200
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:14,397
only thing you have decided not to enjoy the game.

201
00:19:15,999 --> 00:19:19,014
Supposing you don't want to enjoy the food

202
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,703
you can put some quinine on your tongue

203
00:19:21,904 --> 00:19:27,713
and then say I don't like the food, something like that. It's absurd.

204
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:30,216
So try to help me in this,

205
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:33,765
otherwise I'll give up this marriage business I tell you

206
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,297
because it doesn't give me any joy or pleasure.

207
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:41,777
Even one person plays like that I just don't understand.

208
00:19:43,606 --> 00:19:47,749
And for no rhyme and reason you should not say 'no'.

209
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,253
First of all your must look at yourself in the mirror.

210
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:54,746
What are you?

211
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:58,326
What is your education? What is your intellect?

212
00:19:58,527 --> 00:20:01,179
What do you expect from another person?

213
00:20:02,028 --> 00:20:05,718
How much money you have got? How much money the other person has got?

214
00:20:05,743 --> 00:20:08,045
Whatever you want to see, you can see for yourself,

215
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:12,737
to begin with, then compare.

216
00:20:12,938 --> 00:20:19,482
But the greatest thing you have to think about, how many vibrations you have?

217
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:24,097
How much Sahaja Yoga the other one knows?

218
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:26,606
You are married for your ascent.

219
00:20:26,806 --> 00:20:33,256
If the other person has vibrations much more than yours,

220
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:36,056
then your should not unnecessarily boast

221
00:20:36,256 --> 00:20:38,949
of nonsensical gross things;

222
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:44,387
the person is much subtler, make yourself that,

223
00:20:44,588 --> 00:20:48,646
whether it's a woman or a man I don't say,

224
00:20:50,354 --> 00:20:53,721
but I just say that see for yourself: where are you?

225
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:56,971
Specially for beginners who are beginning to take to Sahaja Yoga,

226
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,456
is better to marry some mature Sahaja Yogi

227
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:03,637
so that they can ascend very well, much faster.

228
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:07,396
And also if the other party is not so good, maybe,

229
00:21:07,596 --> 00:21:10,998
we have to work, we have to save that person,

230
00:21:11,198 --> 00:21:16,295
after all, they are not yet matured but they are Sahaja Yogis,

231
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:22,520
they want to do, so try to work it out in that way.

232
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,394
I think you will understand the seriousness,

233
00:21:26,594 --> 00:21:28,886
this is the most important work

234
00:21:29,086 --> 00:21:33,636
that ever happened on this Earth so far,

235
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:36,407
your marriages are very important

236
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:41,666
and you have seen the photographs with the Gods themselves have blessed you.

237
00:21:41,866 --> 00:21:45,104
Because of my consent, because of my selection,

238
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,449
they all were present in your marriage

239
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,688
and how they were giving you tributes

240
00:21:50,889 --> 00:21:55,350
and how they were putting flowers on the brides.

241
00:21:55,551 --> 00:21:59,812
You have seen the photographs. If you have not seen I will show you.

242
00:22:00,212 --> 00:22:02,933
But if you are not a seeker and if you are not seeking

243
00:22:02,957 --> 00:22:06,064
your higher ascent, then you go into

244
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:09,913
nonsensical things and nonsensical ideas.

245
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,394
So better be careful not to do such a thing,

246
00:22:13,595 --> 00:22:18,237
don't think too much of yourself, another note of caution,

247
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:23,339
that you see the way Indians pamper their son-in-laws,

248
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:26,043
so don't get mad.

249
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:29,512
Also they pamper their daughter-in-laws very much.

250
00:22:29,812 --> 00:22:32,964
It's done in India to create better relationships,

251
00:22:33,164 --> 00:22:35,948
because we don't have the balloon of ego so much here.

252
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:41,765
But here as soon as somebody pays attention to you, you go off,

253
00:22:41,965 --> 00:22:44,786
so better be careful. It's a custom here

254
00:22:44,987 --> 00:22:50,167
to look after the son-in-law, to look after the daughter, there is a custom.

255
00:22:50,717 --> 00:22:56,064
Now it is ingrained from ages, it doesn't mean that you are God,

256
00:22:56,089 --> 00:22:59,876
or you are in some superlative condition.

257
00:23:01,188 --> 00:23:05,726
It's just that, that is how they pamper,

258
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:11,715
they look after the daughter-in-law, or the son-in-law, normally.

259
00:23:11,916 --> 00:23:16,427
And you should not carry away ideas,

260
00:23:16,586 --> 00:23:19,002
which I must tell you because it doesn't happen in the west,

261
00:23:19,202 --> 00:23:22,376
I have seen, they don't care. Once that they are married,

262
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,059
they are finished, it's not so, so please be careful.

263
00:23:26,084 --> 00:23:28,865
When you are marrying Indians, you will find the parents

264
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,227
will quite pamper you, look after you,

265
00:23:31,427 --> 00:23:34,909
they'll call you to their house, do this, give you money,

266
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:40,410
give you ornaments, all kinds of things they'll do.

267
00:23:40,611 --> 00:23:46,465
But still one has to understand that is just a custom

268
00:23:46,665 --> 00:23:48,614
and should not get pampered, on the contrary should feel

269
00:23:48,814 --> 00:23:52,438
blissful about it, but when it is done I have seen suddenly

270
00:23:52,638 --> 00:23:56,463
they go off and they think no end of themselves,

271
00:23:56,664 --> 00:23:59,433
their value system goes off.

272
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:03,175
It's because, so far we have had no education,

273
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:06,825
no training about marriages.

274
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:11,175
I am sorry I have to say this in the presence of many Indians.

275
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,696
Indians also you see, expect you to understand

276
00:24:14,897 --> 00:24:16,857
their customs sometimes too much,

277
00:24:17,058 --> 00:24:19,311
for example yesterday the garlands were given,

278
00:24:19,512 --> 00:24:21,906
at the time when the garlands were given,

279
00:24:22,106 --> 00:24:24,804
you are not supposed to garland yourself,

280
00:24:25,004 --> 00:24:27,805
but some of you took the garland put it you,

281
00:24:28,006 --> 00:24:31,704
they regarded it as absolutely unmannerly,

282
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:34,985
but it is so, so when we are in India

283
00:24:35,185 --> 00:24:37,683
we have to understand Indians,

284
00:24:37,883 --> 00:24:42,274
but when we are in the west we have to understand the western people.

285
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:44,789
For example in the west you just go on saying, thank you,

286
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:48,569
thank, thank you, sorry, sorry sorry, sorry sorry sorry,

287
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:50,961
it is so confusing sometimes.

288
00:24:51,162 --> 00:24:53,935
We have to go on shaking hands with so many people,

289
00:24:54,136 --> 00:24:58,155
I mean, I sometimes shake with nine hundred people at a time,

290
00:24:58,355 --> 00:25:02,488
and while they are going back again nine hundred people.

291
00:25:02,689 --> 00:25:05,490
I think namaste is a better idea.

292
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:08,568
See to shake hands with every sort of a person,

293
00:25:08,593 --> 00:25:12,383
you'll catch from every one, but is a custom,

294
00:25:12,584 --> 00:25:15,587
it's custom so we have to understand this is a custom

295
00:25:15,787 --> 00:25:20,392
and which is not to be resented, is not such a bad custom.

296
00:25:20,592 --> 00:25:24,829
There's nothing wrong in it and maybe there is no logic.

297
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,525
For example garlanding yourself there is little logic,

298
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:31,312
you don't garland yourself, somebody else has to garland

299
00:25:31,513 --> 00:25:34,083
and the ladies don't take garlands on their,

300
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,981
you see, because any man cannot garland a lady,

301
00:25:37,181 --> 00:25:40,028
because is only husband has the right,

302
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:42,626
see, so anyone won't garland,

303
00:25:42,827 --> 00:25:46,671
or a son can garland the mother, but any man

304
00:25:46,872 --> 00:25:52,182
cannot garland any lady who is of a younger age,

305
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:55,873
or who is not yet married and even if married,

306
00:25:55,898 --> 00:25:59,621
she has to be an old woman like me, then it's alright,

307
00:25:59,822 --> 00:26:03,742
so these are customs very much ingrained and it's best or logic

308
00:26:03,942 --> 00:26:08,143
that you cannot garland yourself and walk on the street,

309
00:26:08,343 --> 00:26:12,500
even if the leaders here are garlanded

310
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,793
immediately they take out their garland, except for the Gods,

311
00:26:15,994 --> 00:26:20,994
I mean I can carry with my garland but I also take it out,

312
00:26:22,351 --> 00:26:25,440
so these are few customs which must be understood

313
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,141
and there's nothing wrong in it, there's logic,

314
00:26:28,342 --> 00:26:31,259
whatever is illogical we can give up,

315
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:35,718
whatever is logical we have to lake it and understand it.

316
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:39,087
So I am just telling you, that yesterday they started laughing,

317
00:26:39,295 --> 00:26:41,238
children also started laughing, because they thought

318
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:43,770
they are garlanding themselves.

319
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:48,756
it's like doing Aarti to yourself, you know,

320
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:51,138
amounts to that.

321
00:26:51,338 --> 00:26:54,409
So you can understand why they were laughing.

322
00:26:54,610 --> 00:27:00,011
They didn't mean to hurt you in any way, but this is the system.

323
00:27:00,212 --> 00:27:03,887
Now coming to Sahaja Yoga,

324
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:07,793
yesterday was, Left Vishuddhi was too much.

325
00:27:09,014 --> 00:27:11,956
Perhaps in the morning I said you were allvery late

326
00:27:11,981 --> 00:27:15,141
for the formal programme, I don't know,

327
00:27:15,341 --> 00:27:19,144
whatever I say has to be just listened to, that's all.

328
00:27:19,345 --> 00:27:21,513
Only thing is next time we should not be late,

329
00:27:21,713 --> 00:27:24,646
in any formal programme, but it seems such a

330
00:27:24,847 --> 00:27:28,028
Left Vishuddhi was there that I got a lump here

331
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,308
and I just knew what it was.

332
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:34,673
So Mother says to you things which should not hurt you in any way

333
00:27:34,874 --> 00:27:38,150
and you should not take it that seriously but should understand that

334
00:27:38,351 --> 00:27:40,460
next time we should not do so, otherwise

335
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:44,426
you are all wonderful people. You are beautiful people,

336
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,642
I love you, I adore you, not only that,

337
00:27:46,818 --> 00:27:50,529
but I am very proud of you. I'm extremely proud of you,

338
00:27:50,554 --> 00:27:52,804
but I have to tell you something sometimes.

339
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:56,652
But if I tell you even wee bit then if you, get that upset,

340
00:27:56,852 --> 00:28:00,415
I don't know what should I do.

341
00:28:00,616 --> 00:28:04,400
So not to take things that seriously.

342
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:07,955
There's nothing so much wrong.

343
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:11,448
In general I have to tell you things which you should understand

344
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,444
it's for our good, for our enjoyment,

345
00:28:14,469 --> 00:28:17,499
everything to increase your enjoyment.

346
00:28:17,539 --> 00:28:21,892
Even your ascent in Sahaja Yoga is to increase your enjoyment,

347
00:28:22,008 --> 00:28:26,562
your sensitivity to joy to increase it more and more,

348
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,880
all this is done.

349
00:28:29,904 --> 00:28:34,674
