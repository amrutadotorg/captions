00:09.461 --> 00:15.013
Put your right hand on the Brahmarandhra.

00:15.133 --> 00:23.891
Just here. Push it! Move it. Clockwise.

00:24.906 --> 00:30.028
Now the whole of this parting you can move.

00:30.148 --> 00:33.340
All the seven chakras are here.

00:33.460 --> 00:37.133
You can start it from here (the back) if you want.

00:38.133 --> 00:42.188
Back side you should move the other way round (anti-clockwise).

00:42.563 --> 00:45.741
Here also (apex of the head at the back) the other way round.

00:46.382 --> 00:56.039
Now. Especially here, Left Nabhi.

01:00.555 --> 01:04.747
Now, put it on the Brahmarandhra. Move it.

01:04.867 --> 01:08.047
Now, in the clockwise manner.

01:09.164 --> 01:11.445
Now bring it here.

01:15.336 --> 01:19.969
Vishuddhi. Must move Vishuddhi quite a lot.

01:21.945 --> 01:23.833
This is the Viraata’s thing.

01:23.953 --> 01:26.601
Now the Agya (with the Agya finger only).

01:30.586 --> 01:34.992
Now the Hamsa, just with this finger (the Vishuddhi finger).

01:43.820 --> 01:45.328
Better now?

01:51.773 --> 01:53.219
Relieved?

01:53.999 --> 01:55.656
Much better.

01:56.258 --> 02:04.047
Also you can, for your Vishuddhi, you should put your right hand here

02:04.180 --> 02:08.724
and rub it the other way round, means anti-clockwise.

02:08.844 --> 02:11.719
Vishuddhi. Move it!

02:12.523 --> 02:15.945
No with your fingers! Press it hard with your fingers!

02:16.065 --> 02:19.289
You can massage yourself I mean to say.

02:22.437 --> 02:26.055
Just do it like that. It will be nice.

02:30.542 --> 02:32.523
Other way round!

02:35.852 --> 02:43.500
Better now ???. Now much better. Not this way but take it this way.

02:46.765 --> 02:49.774
More on the Left Vishuddhi now.

02:50.859 --> 02:54.601
With a little oil it will be alright.

02:54.721 --> 03:00.391
It’s good! Feeling better now?

03:01.891 --> 03:03.423
Much better?

03:07.117 --> 03:10.844
Cleared out. Much better now.

03:12.273 --> 03:13.320
Alright.

03:15.344 --> 03:17.512
So you can yourself massage.

03:17.632 --> 03:23.146
For example if your eyesight is not alright, massage it here (on back Agnya).

03:23.266 --> 03:29.193
You can take the name of Mahaganesha and Mahabhairava here

03:29.313 --> 03:31.360
and it will work out.

03:34.195 --> 03:37.130
With your fingers please, with your fingers.

03:37.250 --> 03:41.164
You have to rub it with your fingers. Press it hard!

03:41.859 --> 03:46.672
If it is on the Left Side you can feel it or it is on the Right Side.

03:47.719 --> 03:49.568
That’s why I said, “Put oil.”

03:49.688 --> 03:52.044
That doesn’t mean putting oil means just straight forward

03:52.164 --> 03:56.250
pour it into your head but rub it with your fingers. Now better?

03:58.218 --> 04:01.883
Stopped? Coughing has stopped now.

04:02.563 --> 04:06.266
Alright. Better now. See now it’s coming out.

04:08.773 --> 04:12.281
Good! The heat is coming out a little bit.

04:15.055 --> 04:19.649
Now put the right hand towards me and left hand (above Sahastrar).

04:22.352 --> 04:24.571
Haaa, better!

04:33.953 --> 04:37.473
Try with the left hand again. Left hand and right hand (above Sahastrar).

04:37.593 --> 04:39.977
Bend your heads! Bend your head!

04:41.203 --> 04:44.547
Haaa! That’s like humbling down! You know?

04:45.813 --> 04:51.579
Good? Fine? Feeling better now?
