00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:11.970
Shri Mataji: When did you come back?

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:21.580
Yogi: I am here some of the time but I still
have to do things in Exeter.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.580
Shri Mataji: He goes back?

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.580
Is it?

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.580
Yogi: I have to go back so often for work.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:35.460
I should be free of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.460
it soon Mother.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.130
Yogini: He has to go back so often but he’ll
be free soon Mother.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.390
Shri Mataji: Alright.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.370
Yogi: I owe money, you see, down there Mother.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.370
Yogini: He says he earns money down there
Mother

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.370
Shri Mataji: Is it?

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.370
Yogi: Yes.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:49.370
Shri Mataji: I see.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.370
You sing there?

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.610
Yogi: Yeah, but I also owe some money and
I have to pay it and until I pay it I’m

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.149
not really free of it.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.399
Yogini: Ah, he owes money Mother.

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.939
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:26.400
Money seems to be the problem everywhere and
it can be very sapping and it can be very

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.400
funny.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:50.950
Perhaps you do not know that we are just playing
into the hands of lots of negative forces

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.189
in this country and we are doing lots of things
which are really against the Divine, and the

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.359
curses, everybody will have to suffer.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:04.509
We really have to understand our responsibility.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:27.030
Whatever you people are, Sahaja Yogis are,
people are going to reap the benefit of God.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.660
If they are suffering, you are responsible
for it – hundred percent.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.660
One has to understand that.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.879
If you are quarrelling amongst yourselves,
there will be

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:44.180
a problem of quarrelling in the country.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.180
You are the symbols for God.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:59.959
He knows you and whenever you are negative
you are actually helping the Satan.

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.859
And it’s a very sad day I must say.

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:10.569
Everybody seems to be very much high handed
and – I am not saying about Steve, Steve

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:19.370
is not yet into this – but we have had big,
bad problems here in this ashram and it’s

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.129
horrible things have happened.

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.459
I have never had such an experience in India,
which is a poor country.

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.510
Never such a thing!

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:40.860
I mean, it’s the first time I have seen
such a thing happening!

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.030
First of all we all must get properly employed.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:55.500
You must have your self-respect force you
to have a job.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.620
You all must try to get a job.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.310
This I have been telling for the last six
years, if you remember.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:13.260
We cannot be parasites and could be Sahaja
Yogis – cannot be.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.840
Everybody must find out a job for oneself.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.320
Do whatever you please, but you must do some
job.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:30.360
Imagine in India people spend money on you
people!

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:38.380
I have never had any problem whatsoever to
solve of this kind, in India – never!

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.470
You know that very well.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.010
And when I am so strict with them, thinking
they are Indians, that all the money that

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:56.260
they have gathered in Bombay or in Delhi,
or any place, is clamped, completely closed.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.290
And nobody can take a single pie (1/192 rupee)
out of that without my permission!

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.300
Absolutely I have told the banks.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.040
And nobody is unhappy about it.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.720
Not a single pie!

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:20.140
But when we go, they make collections and
whatever money they collect, every pie of

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.130
that is written down clearly.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:28.910
First of all they give all that money to me,
then I give that money to them to spend.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.530
And every single pie that they spend they
write it down.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.290
I may or may not read – is not the point.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:44.350
And whatever is left out, every single pie
of that is put on my feet.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.110
I may put to any use or anything – that’s
a different point.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.400
I may not even take it – that’s a different
point.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.690
But every pie!

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.800
Nobody is without a job.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:04.130
This parasitic nature of any other country
may be excused but not of England.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:16.380
In England you cannot be a parasite because,
I told you, that the heart of the universe

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:37.580
is here, and if anything happens, you all
will be held responsible.

00:06:37.580 --> 00:07:11.020
Now you are going to another ashram (Chelsham
Road) and you are going to stay there.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:19.970
Ashram is not a place for a luxurious life,
not at all, or lethargy and laziness or for

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:25.360
making money or living free!

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.510
It’s absurd!

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:34.800
It’s sinful, it’s blasphemy.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:45.530
That’s the place where you go to develop
your inner being with all truthfulness to

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.550
yourself.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:08:02.360
Before Realisation this was alright, every
way, but after Realisation you have to be

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.090
very, very careful.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:14.850
It’s a tremendous thing to have Awakening,
it’s a tremendous thing to have Realisation,

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:22.790
it is, no doubt, but to maintain it, you must
have, first of all, personal integrity.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:30.470
If you are bent upon deceiving yourself nobody
can help you.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:45.870
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, there is no fees,
nothing.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:50.260
It’s for your gain.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.150
It’s for your good.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.320
It’s a short term policy to be something
nonsensical.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:01.850
One must think of the long term policy.

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:06.590
It’s for your good.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:14.920
If we have to go higher and higher, we have
to be truthful to ourselves.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:22.770
I know everything about everyone, but what’s
the use?

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:30.570
You have know about yourself.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:37.960
And this may be very dangerous, you must understand,
because we are placed at a very precarious

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.990
time now.

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:44.240
Because of that you are getting Realisation
because it’s very emergent – there’s

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.630
a great emergency.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:51.120
Thousands of them have to get Realisation,
no doubt.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:10:07.670
But at this time one has to also understand
the dangers of the atmosphere.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:12.670
Because of so many things that have happened
in this ashram, I cannot account for anything.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:19.960
I just can’t understand it in Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:26.580
Such people should not stay in the ashram
at all, they should get out of it.

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:30.460
Everybody cannot stay in the ashram.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:38.310
You must be prepared to face yourself.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:46.890
Absolutely, there’s no doubt about it.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:55.450
I love you very much and I have great concern
about you, but the sort of things we are doing

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.779
we are just like primitive people here.

00:10:57.779 --> 00:11:00.470
Simple things we cannot do – is to be honest
to ourselves.

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.350
What are we going to do?

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:08.660
We have to give salvation to the whole world.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.320
How can we do it?

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.240
Just tell me?

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:24.690
I am sorry for all that is happening but now,
with a new vow and with a new understanding,

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:30.030
we have to go to the other ashram.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:37.100
Obedience is very important, humility is very
important.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.680
We have to go still further.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:46.710
Anybody who is obstinate by nature should
not stay in an ashram!

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:50.640
Anybody who is arrogant or aggressive should
never come to the ashram.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:59.500
Any sarcasm and all that is nonsense for an
ashram: it brings a bad name to the ashram.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.030
Any kind of extravagance is not needed.

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:07.200
It’s a place of ascetics; people who have
detached their life.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:14.660
Detachment doesn’t mean going to extremes,
standing on your heads and behaving in a funny

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.801
manner on the street carrying my photograph
in the hand!

00:12:17.801 --> 00:12:19.020
It doesn’t mean that nonsense.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:28.850
It’s absolutely normal behaviour but inside
the attention has to be drawn inside.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:33.390
Anybody who is intelligent can understand
that Sahaja Yoga is a tremendously fantastic

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:43.320
thing and one should not take it for granted.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:53.560
It’s very, very, sometimes, disheartening,
very disheartening, the way still the interest

00:12:53.560 --> 00:13:04.990
of the people is more into some things which
are absolutely worthless and useless.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:18.180
Your attention has to be cleared out, then
only this attention which is enlightened,

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.730
is going to enjoy the Spirit.

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:34.430
And, as we were discussing the smog: like
the smog, the whole being becomes darkened

00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:36.970
and black.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:47.430
It’s not nice for me, as a Mother, to say
all these things, it really kills me.

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.180
I really feel very hurt.

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:56.950
But I must tell you the headaches [that] London
Sahaja Yogis and English Sahaja Yogis have

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:01.960
given me, as nobody has given me such headaches.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.580
I have worked hardest in this place.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:10.300
It’s very, very sad.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:22.930
You should read the letter from a girl from
Australia and a letter from a girl from Switzerland.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:30.470
I just met her once – I gave her Realisation
– but look at them, how beautiful they are!

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.190
I mean just see it (Mother is opening a letter).

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:37.530
And when I get really concerned about you
I just read these letters.

00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:38.590
So truthful!

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.330
There’s not only the praise and all that
nonsense, it’s the truth.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:50.240
I mean, there you can feel the vibrations
are coming from these letters only.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:56.840
What’s the use of writing to me something
which you are not?

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:06.120
Now, you have to take a decision.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:12.330
Even if you are only two persons in Sahaja
Yoga I don’t mind.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:18.080
I don’t want people who are not truthful;
who want to compromise with nonsense and falsehood.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.940
Please, be truthful.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:32.220
You cannot say that I worked any less.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:37.210
I have spared no effort at all.

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:41.180
But I am very sad today.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:45.959
The whole thing will fritter away.

00:15:45.959 --> 00:15:54.060
Sometimes I feel that Sahaja Yoga is not suited
to you people at all, the way the things are.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.060
It’s so beautiful outside.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.060
You can’t imagine how people are nice.

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.060
Are you going to waste all my energies?

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:09.790
It’s not even the normal way people behave
here.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:15.380
It’s most surprising!

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:22.279
I have told you that after Realisation you
become really vulnerable and you have to be

00:16:22.279 --> 00:16:23.279
careful.

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:26.589
Now [regarding] marriages I would like to
say something.

00:16:26.589 --> 00:16:27.589
Is he come?

00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:28.589
Tony [Paniotou] Is he there?

00:16:28.589 --> 00:16:29.589
He didn’t come.

00:16:29.589 --> 00:16:52.170
Marriages are not to be treated like that
the marriages you have been treating!

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.410
This is something important!

00:16:53.410 --> 00:17:09.870
You are married for a plan and the plan is
to get very high souls into you.

00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:17.279
They are to be born on this earth.

00:17:17.279 --> 00:17:29.710
They wanted good parents, that’s why I arranged
this marriage system here.

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:31.880
And all of you are giving me headaches!

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:36.470
Even that fellow Rustom, who I took to India,
he is giving me headache even today!

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:38.830
God knows [if] he’s in India or not.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:43.179
People don’t know where he has disappeared!

00:17:43.179 --> 00:17:46.690
I mean, just like vagabonds or criminals!

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:53.190
This is criminality, I think, the way people
are behaving.

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:57.900
I have never said these things to you but
when the whole thing comes up I just don’t

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.450
know what to say!

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:13.629
You have no understanding of the whole thing.

00:18:13.629 --> 00:18:19.489
Or have I chosen absolutely rotten stuff for
my work in England?

00:18:19.489 --> 00:18:23.669
You have no depth, no understanding of any
kind.

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:27.549
So childishly and immaturely you are handling
your marriages.

00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:34.070
There’s no respect for each other.

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:45.080
Marriage is an institution of a great value;
specially, I thought, if it is done in a Sahaja

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.080
way.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:51.919
I just can’t understand – how can you
think of the same things that you would do

00:18:51.919 --> 00:18:54.830
without being Realised?

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:59.080
You fight, you quarrel, you are so petty!

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:08.590
How can you behave like that?

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:13.960
You are supposed to be the pillars.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:18.269
If these are the pillars, I don’t know about
the future.

00:19:18.269 --> 00:19:27.590
I’m really very sad today, really very sad
– in every angle.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:30.809
Even I have heard that people don’t know
even how to keep the bathrooms clean.

00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:31.809
Now am I to teach you how to keep bathrooms?

00:19:31.809 --> 00:19:36.302
You are putting big lemons in the bathrooms
and WCs and loos?

00:19:36.302 --> 00:19:37.302
What is this?

00:19:37.302 --> 00:19:38.302
Have you gone off your heads?

00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:39.302
Are you small children?

00:19:39.302 --> 00:19:42.570
Or what am I to do now with you?

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:43.570
Why are you doing like this?

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:51.759
Are you all possessed?

00:19:51.759 --> 00:19:59.830
What has happened?

00:19:59.830 --> 00:20:06.559
Restrictions you have to put upon yourself,
with your own freedom and understanding and

00:20:06.559 --> 00:20:07.559
intelligence.

00:20:07.559 --> 00:20:10.110
I am not going to tell you to do this or do
that.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.379
That’s a different style.

00:20:11.379 --> 00:20:17.230
You have got the Realisation so easily, in
a simple way.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:18.230
All over the world people have got Realisation.

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:19.230
In Australia there are three hundred people
who have got Realisation.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:26.129
You don’t know how to use your loo?

00:20:26.129 --> 00:20:31.280
I mean what sort of a level it is that I have
to deal with?

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.960
Just tell me.

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:42.639
Even my little grandchild knows how to do
it.

00:20:42.639 --> 00:20:46.259
What’s the matter?

00:20:46.259 --> 00:20:50.190
There is no place for lazy people in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:51.830
You all get out of these ideas.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:52.830
You want to laze out?

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.210
You can get out!

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:57.580
And those who want to make money out of Sahaja
Yoga, get out please!

00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:01.090
I don’t want to see their faces again.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.749
Anybody who is supposed to be working for
Sahaja Yoga has to work outside.

00:21:05.749 --> 00:21:06.960
There’s no place for lazy lumps!

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:11.009
You get out of Sahaja Yog completely!

00:21:11.009 --> 00:21:14.720
I don’t want to see your faces again here!

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.049
It’s my love that has ruined you?

00:21:16.049 --> 00:21:17.049
Or what has happened?

00:21:17.049 --> 00:21:20.450
It’s too much love for you I believe.

00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:27.179
Is it that?

00:21:27.179 --> 00:21:30.230
Somebody starts thinking he’s a big guru
teaching others.

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:31.230
Nonsense!

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:38.039
Hundred times I have told you: there is nothing
like segmentation in Sahaja Yog.

00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:43.350
You all are just my children, all of them,
and you are not to do this way: to put somebody

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:49.200
down and bring somebody else up, make chelas
(disciples) and things like that.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.639
Why don’t you start some gurudom yourself
and make some money outside?

00:21:52.639 --> 00:21:56.779
You will do very well!

00:21:56.779 --> 00:22:02.600
Is this the way to treat me?

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:12.179
What have I done to deserve all this?

00:22:12.179 --> 00:22:21.549
Because I have loved you so much so you should
take me for granted and do all these things

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:23.659
for me?

00:22:23.659 --> 00:22:28.850
Not working out your Realisation, not going
ahead, nothing of the kind; except for fighting

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.440
amongst yourselves and misbehaving!

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:36.769
Everybody thinks they are very clever and
intelligent.

00:22:36.769 --> 00:22:43.789
It’s better to have less intelligent people
who understand God and goodness and righteousness

00:22:43.789 --> 00:22:46.000
in life.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000
You have to wed yourself to righteousness.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.269
This is not another gurudom going on here.

00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:54.331
Even if there are two Sahaja Yogis or one
Sahaja Yogi in London it’s sufficient for

00:22:54.331 --> 00:22:55.331
me.

00:22:55.331 --> 00:23:04.679
I don’t want a quantity of thousands of
horrible, synthetic personalities.

00:23:04.679 --> 00:23:21.253
I can work on one person all my life and I’ll
be happy.

00:23:21.253 --> 00:23:24.679
Even the candle understands me.

00:23:24.679 --> 00:23:30.869
You have seen even the fire understands me.

00:23:30.869 --> 00:23:32.129
You should not take God for granted.

00:23:32.129 --> 00:23:38.840
I am telling you again and again; and Divine
for granted.

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.169
You have to become something.

00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:48.020
You have to grow up.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.020
I think I have done my level best.

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:50.020
I cannot do better that way.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:56.619
I may disappear to India and I’ll go away.

00:23:56.619 --> 00:24:02.710
That’s the best for you people: you fight
with each other, break each other’s necks

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:08.389
or plunder each other’s money and live with
that!

00:24:08.389 --> 00:24:11.850
That’s what it is.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:18.659
Just imagine how I must be feeling to say
all these things to you whom I have loved

00:24:18.659 --> 00:24:23.369
with all my heart, with all my concern, with
all my time, everything.

00:24:23.369 --> 00:24:33.269
You’ve made me so miserable, I tell you!

00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:37.659
You will take a vow, you’ll do this and
then least bothered!

00:24:37.659 --> 00:24:39.140
You can live with it!

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.090
You are compromising all the time with all
the cunning that is within.

00:24:42.090 --> 00:24:43.090
You think I don’t understand the cunning?

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:44.090
But you are cheating yourselves!

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.090
You have to be righteous.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:50.960
Sahaja Yoga is not outside, it is inside!

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:57.159
It is not standing on your heads and doing
things like that, it is inside, the growth

00:24:57.159 --> 00:24:58.159
inside.

00:24:58.159 --> 00:24:59.159
You will lose all your vibrations in no time.

00:24:59.159 --> 00:25:13.919
But that’s a dangerous thing to happen.

00:25:13.919 --> 00:25:30.179
How do you permit such things?

00:25:30.179 --> 00:25:35.749
Also I hold them responsible [those] who permitted
these things.

00:25:35.749 --> 00:25:39.789
Why did you permit in the ashram [that] these
things were happening?

00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:42.720
Why didn’t you find out?

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:50.210
All this kind of high-handedness and all that
– how did you permit it?

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:54.809
Why did you permit it?

00:25:54.809 --> 00:26:00.220
Why didn’t you tell me?

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:03.100
I mean, I have to be bothered about money
and these things?

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.100
Is it?

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:08.750
Is that my purpose of life and work and mission?

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:12.340
Or you have reduced me to that?

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:19.179
It’s very sad.

00:26:19.179 --> 00:26:28.390
I think I’ll have to fast for a week for
your cleansing, that’s the only way things

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:34.000
are going to work out, because you don’t
want to cleanse yourself.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.429
Only when Mataji is facing you you think by
vibrations you know.

00:26:36.429 --> 00:26:37.989
What about your own growth?

00:26:37.989 --> 00:26:52.409
I knew there was something brewing up but
I didn’t pay attention to it.

00:26:52.409 --> 00:27:02.570
I thought that you, yourself, will realise
and come to it and you will have your own

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:05.519
understanding.

00:27:05.519 --> 00:27:06.799
Everything seems to be mechanical.

00:27:06.799 --> 00:27:09.309
Everything seems to be outward.

00:27:09.309 --> 00:27:11.049
There’s nothing inside.

00:27:11.049 --> 00:27:21.679
Sahaja Yoga is not a joke – you cannot make
it.

00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:28.679
You have to love each other truthfully.

00:27:28.679 --> 00:27:38.229
And anybody who does any mistake has to get
out of Sahaj Yog.

00:27:38.229 --> 00:27:44.460
It’s all deliberate.

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.639
Because I had told you that you will be possessed.

00:27:48.639 --> 00:27:50.019
Be careful!

00:27:50.019 --> 00:27:56.399
It’s nice to put everything in the name
of a Satanic forces working on us!

00:27:56.399 --> 00:28:00.460
Then if you going to live with the guidance
of others it’s better you stay with them

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:06.190
permanently and go with them wherever they
are going.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:09.859
If you do not have your own personality and
you cannot think for yourself it’s better

00:28:09.859 --> 00:28:12.009
you be out.

00:28:12.009 --> 00:28:19.849
Those who really want to come up should come
to Sahaja Yoga otherwise there is no need

00:28:19.849 --> 00:28:20.849
to do it.

00:28:20.849 --> 00:28:40.119
If I have spared in any way you can tell me
that.

00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:49.190
I think I have not sighed for years now and
the time has come for you to sigh and sit

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:50.909
and that’s what it is.

00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:51.940
It’s very sad.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.629
There are people who write to me.

00:28:53.629 --> 00:29:02.059
You can see from their letters how much they
are doing for others, how beautiful they are.

00:29:02.059 --> 00:29:11.919
I don’t know when am I going to get that
quality in this country.

00:29:11.919 --> 00:29:21.559
You have to mature, you have to face yourself.

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:27.929
If you do not mature in proper time you will
be rotting on the street.

00:29:27.929 --> 00:29:31.259
You will be just wasted – useless.

00:29:31.259 --> 00:29:34.440
You will be just like other people.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.940
There’s no difference between you and others
then.

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.919
You have to mature in proper time at the right
time.

00:29:40.919 --> 00:30:00.399
I have really started doubting myself now,
that I am no good for you people.

00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:03.779
You need a stronger hand and a sterner person
who will handle you better.

00:30:03.779 --> 00:30:21.489
I have been hearing from people who came for
the first time and they told me something

00:30:21.489 --> 00:30:28.470
about someone and something about someone
and all that.

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:29.769
But I said, “They have come just now, they
cannot understand."

00:30:29.769 --> 00:30:30.769
But no!

00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:33.940
It exists.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:39.601
And if you have any of such things within
you, even a slightest hatred within you can

00:30:39.601 --> 00:30:49.330
create a Hitler in this world.

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:58.049
You are the people who are going to create
a Hitler or God’s world.

00:30:58.049 --> 00:30:59.049
It’s your desire.

00:30:59.049 --> 00:31:04.889
You have to cleanse your hearts completely,
completely.

00:31:04.889 --> 00:31:09.399
Cleanse yourself.

00:31:09.399 --> 00:31:14.369
It’s not [that] you are possessed.

00:31:14.369 --> 00:31:16.779
Just think it over.

00:31:16.779 --> 00:31:21.179
It’s your own weaknesses and you think that
you can get away with it.

00:31:21.179 --> 00:31:25.059
You cannot get away with anything I tell you.

00:31:25.059 --> 00:31:27.739
God’s laws and statutes are very strict.

00:31:27.739 --> 00:31:35.450
That’s why all the gurus are so strict with
their disciples; extremely strict.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:40.759
Those who are real gurus, I am saying, those
who are not making money.

00:31:40.759 --> 00:31:44.349
Of course, those who are making money will
always pamper you.

00:31:44.349 --> 00:31:54.320
But those who are not making money, who are
true gurus, are very strict.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:59.870
Mostly they throw stones at their disciples.

00:31:59.870 --> 00:32:07.879
But I gave you flowers and you gave me stones!

00:32:07.879 --> 00:32:11.879
That is the best!

00:32:11.879 --> 00:32:21.950
It’s everything is only tongue deep, nothing
more!

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:25.080
Nothing goes in the heart, that’s why.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:41.909
If you feel it from the heart, the need to
grow, then you will forget all these things.

00:32:41.909 --> 00:32:53.230
If you feel your Spirit you will feel that
need, that urge, to grow.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:33:06.590
Only your ego or superego is manifesting,
not your Spirit.

00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:19.470
If I say something, the best way to run away
from it is to feel bad about it.

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:23.909
The second best would be to feel guilty about
it.

00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:31.980
But just detach yourself and become your Spirit
and think what have you been doing to yourself.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.629
Actually you are harming yourself every minute!

00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:44.779
You cannot harm me, you cannot harm Sahaj
Yog, these are all eternal things.

00:33:44.779 --> 00:33:52.740
They are eternal, they cannot be harmed, they
cannot be crucified, they cannot be killed,

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:59.450
but you are covering your Spirit with darkness.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:06.679
I have never seen such things happening so
far.

00:34:06.679 --> 00:34:17.929
I mean, I have worked even in East Africa,
all over, but never, never such things.

00:34:17.929 --> 00:34:23.540
This is demonic I don’t know how you can
explain it.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:28.780
I didn’t know you were not keeping any accounts.

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:31.829
I had no idea.

00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:33.929
I had no idea at all [that] you were keeping
no accounts.

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:38.740
I had no idea that money was taken from others
and everybody coming here was paying and nobody

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:42.169
knew what was paid, who was paid, who was
not paying.

00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:43.859
Nothing is known!

00:34:43.859 --> 00:34:56.059
I mean, I thought at least that much you can
manage among yourselves.

00:34:56.059 --> 00:35:04.220
And you know me, I am so particular about,
if you spend any money on me, how much I am

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:10.840
anxious to pay you back – every single pie.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.680
If I have forgotten I don’t know, but if
I have not.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.059
I try to remember every single pie if you
spend.

00:35:18.059 --> 00:35:28.059
I mean, you are supposed to spend for your
guru, but I do not want you to spend a single

00:35:28.059 --> 00:35:30.579
pie on me!

00:35:30.579 --> 00:35:38.280
And if you spend I want to pay it back more
than what you have spent.

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:43.800
Nobody does this way.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:53.650
And I remember ten times that it should be
paid.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:36:01.100
Telling false accounts and false things.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:08.100
I mean, I just can’t understand how can
Sahaja Yogis do it.

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:15.170
Now, I wouldn’t be surprised if they take
to drinking or smoking or something.

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:30.860
I mean, anything is possible under the sun.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:38.810
I mean, if you can do such depraved things,
you can do anything!

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:43.539
After all you are free!

00:36:43.539 --> 00:36:46.462
This abandonment at this time is very dangerous.

00:36:46.462 --> 00:36:51.380
I had told you that, when the saints fall
they go very deep down, very deep down.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.809
So be careful: you are all saints now.

00:36:52.809 --> 00:36:53.920
Understand that, realise it.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:54.920
Assume your powers.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:37:07.099
Assume your seats, your thrones, and don’t
behave like beggars on the street or criminals.

00:37:07.099 --> 00:37:08.643
There is no excuse for such people.

00:37:08.643 --> 00:37:10.580
No excuse at all.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:20.000
Do not try to find excuses!

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:38.079
There were so many people yesterday who were
not Sahaja Yogis and I didn’t want to say

00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:43.880
there, in their presence yesterday these things.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:38:03.510
But I came to know about these horrible things
which happened and I was amazed!

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:08.619
Everything should be in the open in Sahaja
Yoga, I have told you a hundred times; not

00:38:08.619 --> 00:38:10.859
to hide anything.

00:38:10.859 --> 00:38:16.180
Accounts, everything should be written down.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:20.640
You will be amazed, when I go to India, you
will see, even Rahuri, it’s a village where

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.339
there are people paying £5, £10.

00:38:23.339 --> 00:38:28.289
They make a book, when I go there, at my feet.

00:38:28.289 --> 00:38:36.270
They leave it with me for one day that, “Mother
please see it.

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:39.630
You must see it.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:42.140
At least glance."

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.660
I mean, imagine!

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.280
These are uneducated, simple village folks
and they understand.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:49.180
Even my servant!

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:54.340
My servant has so much sense!

00:38:54.340 --> 00:39:00.690
He’s so honest.

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:09.150
No Sahaja Yogi should ever marry a Sahaja
Yogini.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:10.430
Better stop all that seeking.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:13.890
And now this nonsense has started now, working
out.

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:20.289
As it is the problem of money management is
horrible and then if you start like this there

00:39:20.289 --> 00:39:21.400
cannot be, no more, any yogi left!

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:33.059
It’s better to marry outside than to marry
a Sahaja Yogi and Sahaja Yogini.

00:39:33.059 --> 00:39:40.849
As if the bhoots go into geometrical progression
when they marry and they become so horrid

00:39:40.849 --> 00:39:46.160
and ugly; if there was a saint to be born
he’ll run away!

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.510
Only the bhoots and the rakshasas will be
born to these people!

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:48.710
That’s what I can see.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:55.730
The way they talk and the way they behave
it’s so funny.

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:59.410
I can’t believe it that they are the same
Sahaja Yogis who were married the other day!

00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:09.610
(the marriage of Tony Paniotou and Dawn whom
Mother married on 4 July 1980)

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:20.240
Every pie that is spent now has to be shown
to me because you do not count all those.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:23.099
No money should be borrowed from each other!

00:40:23.099 --> 00:40:30.400
Not a single pie.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:40.019
Everything that is financial, you have to
tell me.

00:40:40.019 --> 00:40:57.180
Everything that you are doing in the name
of Sahaja Yoga you have to tell me or in the

00:40:57.180 --> 00:41:05.390
group of Sahaja Yogis you must tell.

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:06.720
You’d better not do anything on your own.

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.869
Then you will be blessed.

00:41:07.869 --> 00:41:08.890
“Yoga kshema Vahamyaham” First yoga.

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:09.890
First yoga.

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:10.890
Achieve your yoga!

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:14.610
All your problems will be solved.

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:17.970
I promise you.

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:22.450
First achieve your yoga.

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:25.140
You have seen so many people.

00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:30.930
It has happened with so many.

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:31.930
You know Regis’ case as you have seen.

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:34.549
He could not get through his PhD.

00:41:34.549 --> 00:41:36.960
I only blessed his thesis.

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.900
I didn’t even read!

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:40.829
Nothing of the kind.

00:41:40.829 --> 00:41:43.730
Next day he became a Dr!

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:48.720
I mean, there are so many cases, thousand
and one, you can see it, where yoga has helped.

00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:52.870
But yoga must be achieved and maintained and
respected.

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:58.250
If you are not a yogi why should God bless
you?

00:41:58.250 --> 00:41:59.599
For what?

00:41:59.599 --> 00:42:05.410
Why should he bless you?

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:07.839
Then the kshema also changes it’s form.

00:42:07.839 --> 00:42:09.390
There’s a lady who has written to me from
Australia.

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:17.380
She wrote to me, “My grandmother is very
sick Mother and I don’t know what to do.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:21.799
And I want that she should be helped."

00:42:21.799 --> 00:42:29.289
And she wanted to do some operation or something
but she was so much better that they did not

00:42:29.289 --> 00:42:30.289
operate her.

00:42:30.289 --> 00:42:34.319
But she had to go on a nursing home and there
was no reservation, nothing; suddenly she

00:42:34.319 --> 00:42:41.559
got a call that there’s suddenly a reservation
for you and you come.

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:51.339
I mean, this is one of the smallest things
that can happen.

00:42:51.339 --> 00:42:57.599
Yoga is to be established on two points.

00:42:57.599 --> 00:43:05.849
The sin against the Mother and the sin against
the Father.

00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:16.230
Sin against the Mother is when you do not
look after your chastity.

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:20.940
Your attention has to be pure and purer and
purest.

00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:36.790
And the sin against the Father is when you
try to make money here and there: cut corners

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:44.539
and try to save money and run after money
and worry about it.

00:43:44.539 --> 00:43:52.730
Any such enterprise, any such thing: underhand
dealings, high hand dealings, anything like

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:58.050
that, is the sin against the Father.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:44:09.910
You are the people who have started believing,
also, that money is not important.

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:15.670
So, according to them, if you make some frauds
it doesn’t matter, “After all money is

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:16.710
not important so what?”

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:27.720
And they have reached such conclusions.

00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:36.799
But in the name of God, to take a single pie
is a sin.

00:44:36.799 --> 00:44:44.760
In the same way, to mishandle even a single
pie while dealing with God – be careful,

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:52.519
I am telling you!

00:44:52.519 --> 00:44:54.740
And grace cannot help you there!

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:59.410
And this is a very sensitive point.

00:44:59.410 --> 00:45:06.910
For you it may not be, but for God it is.

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:25.839
Those who make money in the name of God are
equally bad [as] those who try to do anything

00:45:25.839 --> 00:45:29.280
to hide money.

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:34.619
It’s just the same.

00:45:34.619 --> 00:45:49.769
This is the work of God and you have to be
pure people, you have to be clean, beautiful,

00:45:49.769 --> 00:45:53.349
loving people, like children.

00:45:53.349 --> 00:46:01.890
Christ has said that you have to be like children
to be able to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:14.170
But you have entered and you’ll be thrown
back!

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:21.869
There is more attention towards gaining more
power, like saying mantras after mantras,

00:46:21.869 --> 00:46:24.140
this, that, just to gain power.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:25.510
What power is this?

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:29.609
The power is of innocence and of purity.

00:46:29.609 --> 00:46:36.150
There is no other power higher than this – of
simple innocence and purity.

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:40.579
And you know that from me.

00:46:40.579 --> 00:46:45.829
An innocent person can never be harmed.

00:46:45.829 --> 00:47:04.869
Try to be humble and ask for innocence to
be re-established within you.

00:47:04.869 --> 00:47:21.390
A cunning man goes a very little way to his
doom, very fast.

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:30.630
If somebody cheats you it does not matter
but if you cheat someone, you will be doubly

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:44.130
punished because you are a yogi, you are wearing
the banner of God.

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:48.050
Try to remember this.

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:50.209
I do not think you should
