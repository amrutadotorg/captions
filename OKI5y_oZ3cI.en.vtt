WEBVTT

00:02.950 --> 00:11.970
Shri Mataji: When did you come back?

00:11.970 --> 00:21.580
Yogi: I am here some of the time but I still
have to do things in Exeter.

00:21.580 --> 00:22.580
Shri Mataji: He goes back?

00:22.580 --> 00:23.580
Is it?

00:23.580 --> 00:24.580
Yogi: I have to go back so often for work.

00:24.580 --> 00:35.460
I should be free of

00:35.460 --> 00:36.460
it soon Mother.

00:36.460 --> 00:42.130
Yogini: He has to go back so often but he’ll
be free soon Mother.

00:42.130 --> 00:43.390
Shri Mataji: Alright.

00:43.390 --> 00:45.370
Yogi: I owe money, you see, down there Mother.

00:45.370 --> 00:46.370
Yogini: He says he earns money down there
Mother

00:46.370 --> 00:47.370
Shri Mataji: Is it?

00:47.370 --> 00:48.370
Yogi: Yes.

00:48.370 --> 00:49.370
Shri Mataji: I see.

00:49.370 --> 00:50.370
You sing there?

00:50.370 --> 00:53.610
Yogi: Yeah, but I also owe some money and
I have to pay it and until I pay it I’m

00:53.610 --> 00:57.149
not really free of it.

00:57.149 --> 01:01.399
Yogini: Ah, he owes money Mother.

01:01.399 --> 01:04.939
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

01:04.939 --> 01:26.400
Money seems to be the problem everywhere and
it can be very sapping and it can be very

01:26.400 --> 01:27.400
funny.

01:27.400 --> 01:50.950
Perhaps you do not know that we are just playing
into the hands of lots of negative forces

01:50.950 --> 01:56.189
in this country and we are doing lots of things
which are really against the Divine, and the

01:56.189 --> 01:58.359
curses, everybody will have to suffer.

01:58.359 --> 02:04.509
We really have to understand our responsibility.

02:04.509 --> 02:27.030
Whatever you people are, Sahaja Yogis are,
people are going to reap the benefit of God.

02:27.030 --> 02:29.660
If they are suffering, you are responsible
for it – hundred percent.

02:29.660 --> 02:30.660
One has to understand that.

02:30.660 --> 02:35.879
If you are quarrelling amongst yourselves,
there will be

02:35.879 --> 02:44.180
a problem of quarrelling in the country.

02:44.180 --> 02:45.180
You are the symbols for God.

02:45.180 --> 02:59.959
He knows you and whenever you are negative
you are actually helping the Satan.

02:59.959 --> 03:03.859
And it’s a very sad day I must say.

03:03.859 --> 03:10.569
Everybody seems to be very much high handed
and – I am not saying about Steve, Steve

03:10.569 --> 03:19.370
is not yet into this – but we have had big,
bad problems here in this ashram and it’s

03:19.370 --> 03:22.129
horrible things have happened.

03:22.129 --> 03:27.459
I have never had such an experience in India,
which is a poor country.

03:27.459 --> 03:29.510
Never such a thing!

03:29.510 --> 03:40.860
I mean, it’s the first time I have seen
such a thing happening!

03:40.860 --> 03:43.030
First of all we all must get properly employed.

03:43.030 --> 03:55.500
You must have your self-respect force you
to have a job.

03:55.500 --> 03:59.620
You all must try to get a job.

03:59.620 --> 04:05.310
This I have been telling for the last six
years, if you remember.

04:05.310 --> 04:13.260
We cannot be parasites and could be Sahaja
Yogis – cannot be.

04:13.260 --> 04:14.840
Everybody must find out a job for oneself.

04:14.840 --> 04:19.320
Do whatever you please, but you must do some
job.

04:19.320 --> 04:30.360
Imagine in India people spend money on you
people!

04:30.360 --> 04:38.380
I have never had any problem whatsoever to
solve of this kind, in India – never!

04:38.380 --> 04:42.470
You know that very well.

04:42.470 --> 04:47.010
And when I am so strict with them, thinking
they are Indians, that all the money that

04:47.010 --> 04:56.260
they have gathered in Bombay or in Delhi,
or any place, is clamped, completely closed.

04:56.260 --> 05:01.290
And nobody can take a single pie (1/192 rupee)
out of that without my permission!

05:01.290 --> 05:05.300
Absolutely I have told the banks.

05:05.300 --> 05:07.040
And nobody is unhappy about it.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.720
Not a single pie!

05:09.720 --> 05:20.140
But when we go, they make collections and
whatever money they collect, every pie of

05:20.140 --> 05:22.130
that is written down clearly.

05:22.130 --> 05:28.910
First of all they give all that money to me,
then I give that money to them to spend.

05:28.910 --> 05:31.530
And every single pie that they spend they
write it down.

05:31.530 --> 05:35.290
I may or may not read – is not the point.

05:35.290 --> 05:44.350
And whatever is left out, every single pie
of that is put on my feet.

05:44.350 --> 05:48.110
I may put to any use or anything – that’s
a different point.

05:48.110 --> 05:52.400
I may not even take it – that’s a different
point.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.690
But every pie!

05:55.690 --> 05:57.800
Nobody is without a job.

05:57.800 --> 06:04.130
This parasitic nature of any other country
may be excused but not of England.

06:04.130 --> 06:16.380
In England you cannot be a parasite because,
I told you, that the heart of the universe

06:16.380 --> 06:37.580
is here, and if anything happens, you all
will be held responsible.

06:37.580 --> 07:11.020
Now you are going to another ashram (Chelsham
Road) and you are going to stay there.

07:11.020 --> 07:19.970
Ashram is not a place for a luxurious life,
not at all, or lethargy and laziness or for

07:19.970 --> 07:25.360
making money or living free!

07:25.360 --> 07:28.510
It’s absurd!

07:28.510 --> 07:34.800
It’s sinful, it’s blasphemy.

07:34.800 --> 07:45.530
That’s the place where you go to develop
your inner being with all truthfulness to

07:45.530 --> 07:46.550
yourself.

07:46.550 --> 08:02.360
Before Realisation this was alright, every
way, but after Realisation you have to be

08:02.360 --> 08:07.090
very, very careful.

08:07.090 --> 08:14.850
It’s a tremendous thing to have Awakening,
it’s a tremendous thing to have Realisation,

08:14.850 --> 08:22.790
it is, no doubt, but to maintain it, you must
have, first of all, personal integrity.

08:22.790 --> 08:30.470
If you are bent upon deceiving yourself nobody
can help you.

08:30.470 --> 08:45.870
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, there is no fees,
nothing.

08:45.870 --> 08:50.260
It’s for your gain.

08:50.260 --> 08:52.150
It’s for your good.

08:52.150 --> 08:56.320
It’s a short term policy to be something
nonsensical.

08:56.320 --> 09:01.850
One must think of the long term policy.

09:01.850 --> 09:06.590
It’s for your good.

09:06.590 --> 09:14.920
If we have to go higher and higher, we have
to be truthful to ourselves.

09:14.920 --> 09:22.770
I know everything about everyone, but what’s
the use?

09:22.770 --> 09:30.570
You have know about yourself.

09:30.570 --> 09:37.960
And this may be very dangerous, you must understand,
because we are placed at a very precarious

09:37.960 --> 09:38.990
time now.

09:38.990 --> 09:44.240
Because of that you are getting Realisation
because it’s very emergent – there’s

09:44.240 --> 09:46.630
a great emergency.

09:46.630 --> 09:51.120
Thousands of them have to get Realisation,
no doubt.

09:51.120 --> 10:07.670
But at this time one has to also understand
the dangers of the atmosphere.

10:07.670 --> 10:12.670
Because of so many things that have happened
in this ashram, I cannot account for anything.

10:12.670 --> 10:19.960
I just can’t understand it in Sahaja Yoga.

10:19.960 --> 10:26.580
Such people should not stay in the ashram
at all, they should get out of it.

10:26.580 --> 10:30.460
Everybody cannot stay in the ashram.

10:30.460 --> 10:38.310
You must be prepared to face yourself.

10:38.310 --> 10:46.890
Absolutely, there’s no doubt about it.

10:46.890 --> 10:55.450
I love you very much and I have great concern
about you, but the sort of things we are doing

10:55.450 --> 10:57.779
we are just like primitive people here.

10:57.779 --> 11:00.470
Simple things we cannot do – is to be honest
to ourselves.

11:00.470 --> 11:03.350
What are we going to do?

11:03.350 --> 11:08.660
We have to give salvation to the whole world.

11:08.660 --> 11:12.320
How can we do it?

11:12.320 --> 11:14.240
Just tell me?

11:14.240 --> 11:24.690
I am sorry for all that is happening but now,
with a new vow and with a new understanding,

11:24.690 --> 11:30.030
we have to go to the other ashram.

11:30.030 --> 11:37.100
Obedience is very important, humility is very
important.

11:37.100 --> 11:40.680
We have to go still further.

11:40.680 --> 11:46.710
Anybody who is obstinate by nature should
not stay in an ashram!

11:46.710 --> 11:50.640
Anybody who is arrogant or aggressive should
never come to the ashram.

11:50.640 --> 11:59.500
Any sarcasm and all that is nonsense for an
ashram: it brings a bad name to the ashram.

11:59.500 --> 12:02.030
Any kind of extravagance is not needed.

12:02.030 --> 12:07.200
It’s a place of ascetics; people who have
detached their life.

12:07.200 --> 12:14.660
Detachment doesn’t mean going to extremes,
standing on your heads and behaving in a funny

12:14.660 --> 12:17.801
manner on the street carrying my photograph
in the hand!

12:17.801 --> 12:19.020
It doesn’t mean that nonsense.

12:19.020 --> 12:28.850
It’s absolutely normal behaviour but inside
the attention has to be drawn inside.

12:28.850 --> 12:33.390
Anybody who is intelligent can understand
that Sahaja Yoga is a tremendously fantastic

12:33.390 --> 12:43.320
thing and one should not take it for granted.

12:43.320 --> 12:53.560
It’s very, very, sometimes, disheartening,
very disheartening, the way still the interest

12:53.560 --> 13:04.990
of the people is more into some things which
are absolutely worthless and useless.

13:04.990 --> 13:18.180
Your attention has to be cleared out, then
only this attention which is enlightened,

13:18.180 --> 13:20.730
is going to enjoy the Spirit.

13:20.730 --> 13:34.430
And, as we were discussing the smog: like
the smog, the whole being becomes darkened

13:34.430 --> 13:36.970
and black.

13:36.970 --> 13:47.430
It’s not nice for me, as a Mother, to say
all these things, it really kills me.

13:47.430 --> 13:50.180
I really feel very hurt.

13:50.180 --> 13:56.950
But I must tell you the headaches [that] London
Sahaja Yogis and English Sahaja Yogis have

13:56.950 --> 14:01.960
given me, as nobody has given me such headaches.

14:01.960 --> 14:05.580
I have worked hardest in this place.

14:05.580 --> 14:10.300
It’s very, very sad.

14:10.300 --> 14:22.930
You should read the letter from a girl from
Australia and a letter from a girl from Switzerland.

14:22.930 --> 14:30.470
I just met her once – I gave her Realisation
– but look at them, how beautiful they are!

14:30.470 --> 14:33.190
I mean just see it (Mother is opening a letter).

14:33.190 --> 14:37.530
And when I get really concerned about you
I just read these letters.

14:37.530 --> 14:38.590
So truthful!

14:38.590 --> 14:42.330
There’s not only the praise and all that
nonsense, it’s the truth.

14:42.330 --> 14:50.240
I mean, there you can feel the vibrations
are coming from these letters only.

14:50.240 --> 14:56.840
What’s the use of writing to me something
which you are not?

14:56.840 --> 15:06.120
Now, you have to take a decision.

15:06.120 --> 15:12.330
Even if you are only two persons in Sahaja
Yoga I don’t mind.

15:12.330 --> 15:18.080
I don’t want people who are not truthful;
who want to compromise with nonsense and falsehood.

15:18.080 --> 15:21.940
Please, be truthful.

15:21.940 --> 15:32.220
You cannot say that I worked any less.

15:32.220 --> 15:37.210
I have spared no effort at all.

15:37.210 --> 15:41.180
But I am very sad today.

15:41.180 --> 15:45.959
The whole thing will fritter away.

15:45.959 --> 15:54.060
Sometimes I feel that Sahaja Yoga is not suited
to you people at all, the way the things are.

15:54.060 --> 15:55.060
It’s so beautiful outside.

15:55.060 --> 15:56.060
You can’t imagine how people are nice.

15:56.060 --> 15:57.060
Are you going to waste all my energies?

15:57.060 --> 16:09.790
It’s not even the normal way people behave
here.

16:09.790 --> 16:15.380
It’s most surprising!

16:15.380 --> 16:22.279
I have told you that after Realisation you
become really vulnerable and you have to be

16:22.279 --> 16:23.279
careful.

16:23.279 --> 16:26.589
Now [regarding] marriages I would like to
say something.

16:26.589 --> 16:27.589
Is he come?

16:27.589 --> 16:28.589
Tony [Paniotou] Is he there?

16:28.589 --> 16:29.589
He didn’t come.

16:29.589 --> 16:52.170
Marriages are not to be treated like that
the marriages you have been treating!

16:52.170 --> 16:53.410
This is something important!

16:53.410 --> 17:09.870
You are married for a plan and the plan is
to get very high souls into you.

17:09.870 --> 17:17.279
They are to be born on this earth.

17:17.279 --> 17:29.710
They wanted good parents, that’s why I arranged
this marriage system here.

17:29.710 --> 17:31.880
And all of you are giving me headaches!

17:31.880 --> 17:36.470
Even that fellow Rustom, who I took to India,
he is giving me headache even today!

17:36.470 --> 17:38.830
God knows [if] he’s in India or not.

17:38.830 --> 17:43.179
People don’t know where he has disappeared!

17:43.179 --> 17:46.690
I mean, just like vagabonds or criminals!

17:46.690 --> 17:53.190
This is criminality, I think, the way people
are behaving.

17:53.190 --> 17:57.900
I have never said these things to you but
when the whole thing comes up I just don’t

17:57.900 --> 18:02.450
know what to say!

18:02.450 --> 18:13.629
You have no understanding of the whole thing.

18:13.629 --> 18:19.489
Or have I chosen absolutely rotten stuff for
my work in England?

18:19.489 --> 18:23.669
You have no depth, no understanding of any
kind.

18:23.669 --> 18:27.549
So childishly and immaturely you are handling
your marriages.

18:27.549 --> 18:34.070
There’s no respect for each other.

18:34.070 --> 18:45.080
Marriage is an institution of a great value;
specially, I thought, if it is done in a Sahaja

18:45.080 --> 18:46.080
way.

18:46.080 --> 18:51.919
I just can’t understand – how can you
think of the same things that you would do

18:51.919 --> 18:54.830
without being Realised?

18:54.830 --> 18:59.080
You fight, you quarrel, you are so petty!

18:59.080 --> 19:08.590
How can you behave like that?

19:08.590 --> 19:13.960
You are supposed to be the pillars.

19:13.960 --> 19:18.269
If these are the pillars, I don’t know about
the future.

19:18.269 --> 19:27.590
I’m really very sad today, really very sad
– in every angle.

19:27.590 --> 19:30.809
Even I have heard that people don’t know
even how to keep the bathrooms clean.

19:30.809 --> 19:31.809
Now am I to teach you how to keep bathrooms?

19:31.809 --> 19:36.302
You are putting big lemons in the bathrooms
and WCs and loos?

19:36.302 --> 19:37.302
What is this?

19:37.302 --> 19:38.302
Have you gone off your heads?

19:38.302 --> 19:39.302
Are you small children?

19:39.302 --> 19:42.570
Or what am I to do now with you?

19:42.570 --> 19:43.570
Why are you doing like this?

19:43.570 --> 19:51.759
Are you all possessed?

19:51.759 --> 19:59.830
What has happened?

19:59.830 --> 20:06.559
Restrictions you have to put upon yourself,
with your own freedom and understanding and

20:06.559 --> 20:07.559
intelligence.

20:07.559 --> 20:10.110
I am not going to tell you to do this or do
that.

20:10.110 --> 20:11.379
That’s a different style.

20:11.379 --> 20:17.230
You have got the Realisation so easily, in
a simple way.

20:17.230 --> 20:18.230
All over the world people have got Realisation.

20:18.230 --> 20:19.230
In Australia there are three hundred people
who have got Realisation.

20:19.230 --> 20:26.129
You don’t know how to use your loo?

20:26.129 --> 20:31.280
I mean what sort of a level it is that I have
to deal with?

20:31.280 --> 20:32.960
Just tell me.

20:32.960 --> 20:42.639
Even my little grandchild knows how to do
it.

20:42.639 --> 20:46.259
What’s the matter?

20:46.259 --> 20:50.190
There is no place for lazy people in Sahaja
Yoga.

20:50.190 --> 20:51.830
You all get out of these ideas.

20:51.830 --> 20:52.830
You want to laze out?

20:52.830 --> 20:54.210
You can get out!

20:54.210 --> 20:57.580
And those who want to make money out of Sahaja
Yoga, get out please!

20:57.580 --> 21:01.090
I don’t want to see their faces again.

21:01.090 --> 21:05.749
Anybody who is supposed to be working for
Sahaja Yoga has to work outside.

21:05.749 --> 21:06.960
There’s no place for lazy lumps!

21:06.960 --> 21:11.009
You get out of Sahaja Yog completely!

21:11.009 --> 21:14.720
I don’t want to see your faces again here!

21:14.720 --> 21:16.049
It’s my love that has ruined you?

21:16.049 --> 21:17.049
Or what has happened?

21:17.049 --> 21:20.450
It’s too much love for you I believe.

21:20.450 --> 21:27.179
Is it that?

21:27.179 --> 21:30.230
Somebody starts thinking he’s a big guru
teaching others.

21:30.230 --> 21:31.230
Nonsense!

21:31.230 --> 21:38.039
Hundred times I have told you: there is nothing
like segmentation in Sahaja Yog.

21:38.039 --> 21:43.350
You all are just my children, all of them,
and you are not to do this way: to put somebody

21:43.350 --> 21:49.200
down and bring somebody else up, make chelas
(disciples) and things like that.

21:49.200 --> 21:52.639
Why don’t you start some gurudom yourself
and make some money outside?

21:52.639 --> 21:56.779
You will do very well!

21:56.779 --> 22:02.600
Is this the way to treat me?

22:02.600 --> 22:12.179
What have I done to deserve all this?

22:12.179 --> 22:21.549
Because I have loved you so much so you should
take me for granted and do all these things

22:21.549 --> 22:23.659
for me?

22:23.659 --> 22:28.850
Not working out your Realisation, not going
ahead, nothing of the kind; except for fighting

22:28.850 --> 22:31.440
amongst yourselves and misbehaving!

22:31.440 --> 22:36.769
Everybody thinks they are very clever and
intelligent.

22:36.769 --> 22:43.789
It’s better to have less intelligent people
who understand God and goodness and righteousness

22:43.789 --> 22:46.000
in life.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
You have to wed yourself to righteousness.

22:47.000 --> 22:51.269
This is not another gurudom going on here.

22:51.269 --> 22:54.331
Even if there are two Sahaja Yogis or one
Sahaja Yogi in London it’s sufficient for

22:54.331 --> 22:55.331
me.

22:55.331 --> 23:04.679
I don’t want a quantity of thousands of
horrible, synthetic personalities.

23:04.679 --> 23:21.253
I can work on one person all my life and I’ll
be happy.

23:21.253 --> 23:24.679
Even the candle understands me.

23:24.679 --> 23:30.869
You have seen even the fire understands me.

23:30.869 --> 23:32.129
You should not take God for granted.

23:32.129 --> 23:38.840
I am telling you again and again; and Divine
for granted.

23:38.840 --> 23:41.169
You have to become something.

23:41.169 --> 23:48.020
You have to grow up.

23:48.020 --> 23:49.020
I think I have done my level best.

23:49.020 --> 23:50.020
I cannot do better that way.

23:50.020 --> 23:56.619
I may disappear to India and I’ll go away.

23:56.619 --> 24:02.710
That’s the best for you people: you fight
with each other, break each other’s necks

24:02.710 --> 24:08.389
or plunder each other’s money and live with
that!

24:08.389 --> 24:11.850
That’s what it is.

24:11.850 --> 24:18.659
Just imagine how I must be feeling to say
all these things to you whom I have loved

24:18.659 --> 24:23.369
with all my heart, with all my concern, with
all my time, everything.

24:23.369 --> 24:33.269
You’ve made me so miserable, I tell you!

24:33.269 --> 24:37.659
You will take a vow, you’ll do this and
then least bothered!

24:37.659 --> 24:39.140
You can live with it!

24:39.140 --> 24:42.090
You are compromising all the time with all
the cunning that is within.

24:42.090 --> 24:43.090
You think I don’t understand the cunning?

24:43.090 --> 24:44.090
But you are cheating yourselves!

24:44.090 --> 24:45.090
You have to be righteous.

24:45.090 --> 24:50.960
Sahaja Yoga is not outside, it is inside!

24:50.960 --> 24:57.159
It is not standing on your heads and doing
things like that, it is inside, the growth

24:57.159 --> 24:58.159
inside.

24:58.159 --> 24:59.159
You will lose all your vibrations in no time.

24:59.159 --> 25:13.919
But that’s a dangerous thing to happen.

25:13.919 --> 25:30.179
How do you permit such things?

25:30.179 --> 25:35.749
Also I hold them responsible [those] who permitted
these things.

25:35.749 --> 25:39.789
Why did you permit in the ashram [that] these
things were happening?

25:39.789 --> 25:42.720
Why didn’t you find out?

25:42.720 --> 25:50.210
All this kind of high-handedness and all that
– how did you permit it?

25:50.210 --> 25:54.809
Why did you permit it?

25:54.809 --> 26:00.220
Why didn’t you tell me?

26:00.220 --> 26:03.100
I mean, I have to be bothered about money
and these things?

26:03.100 --> 26:04.100
Is it?

26:04.100 --> 26:08.750
Is that my purpose of life and work and mission?

26:08.750 --> 26:12.340
Or you have reduced me to that?

26:12.340 --> 26:19.179
It’s very sad.

26:19.179 --> 26:28.390
I think I’ll have to fast for a week for
your cleansing, that’s the only way things

26:28.390 --> 26:34.000
are going to work out, because you don’t
want to cleanse yourself.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.429
Only when Mataji is facing you you think by
vibrations you know.

26:36.429 --> 26:37.989
What about your own growth?

26:37.989 --> 26:52.409
I knew there was something brewing up but
I didn’t pay attention to it.

26:52.409 --> 27:02.570
I thought that you, yourself, will realise
and come to it and you will have your own

27:02.570 --> 27:05.519
understanding.

27:05.519 --> 27:06.799
Everything seems to be mechanical.

27:06.799 --> 27:09.309
Everything seems to be outward.

27:09.309 --> 27:11.049
There’s nothing inside.

27:11.049 --> 27:21.679
Sahaja Yoga is not a joke – you cannot make
it.

27:21.679 --> 27:28.679
You have to love each other truthfully.

27:28.679 --> 27:38.229
And anybody who does any mistake has to get
out of Sahaj Yog.

27:38.229 --> 27:44.460
It’s all deliberate.

27:44.460 --> 27:48.639
Because I had told you that you will be possessed.

27:48.639 --> 27:50.019
Be careful!

27:50.019 --> 27:56.399
It’s nice to put everything in the name
of a Satanic forces working on us!

27:56.399 --> 28:00.460
Then if you going to live with the guidance
of others it’s better you stay with them

28:00.460 --> 28:06.190
permanently and go with them wherever they
are going.

28:06.190 --> 28:09.859
If you do not have your own personality and
you cannot think for yourself it’s better

28:09.859 --> 28:12.009
you be out.

28:12.009 --> 28:19.849
Those who really want to come up should come
to Sahaja Yoga otherwise there is no need

28:19.849 --> 28:20.849
to do it.

28:20.849 --> 28:40.119
If I have spared in any way you can tell me
that.

28:40.119 --> 28:49.190
I think I have not sighed for years now and
the time has come for you to sigh and sit

28:49.190 --> 28:50.909
and that’s what it is.

28:50.909 --> 28:51.940
It’s very sad.

28:51.940 --> 28:53.629
There are people who write to me.

28:53.629 --> 29:02.059
You can see from their letters how much they
are doing for others, how beautiful they are.

29:02.059 --> 29:11.919
I don’t know when am I going to get that
quality in this country.

29:11.919 --> 29:21.559
You have to mature, you have to face yourself.

29:21.559 --> 29:27.929
If you do not mature in proper time you will
be rotting on the street.

29:27.929 --> 29:31.259
You will be just wasted – useless.

29:31.259 --> 29:34.440
You will be just like other people.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.940
There’s no difference between you and others
then.

29:37.940 --> 29:40.919
You have to mature in proper time at the right
time.

29:40.919 --> 30:00.399
I have really started doubting myself now,
that I am no good for you people.

30:00.399 --> 30:03.779
You need a stronger hand and a sterner person
who will handle you better.

30:03.779 --> 30:21.489
I have been hearing from people who came for
the first time and they told me something

30:21.489 --> 30:28.470
about someone and something about someone
and all that.

30:28.470 --> 30:29.769
But I said, “They have come just now, they
cannot understand."

30:29.769 --> 30:30.769
But no!

30:30.769 --> 30:33.940
It exists.

30:33.940 --> 30:39.601
And if you have any of such things within
you, even a slightest hatred within you can

30:39.601 --> 30:49.330
create a Hitler in this world.

30:49.330 --> 30:58.049
You are the people who are going to create
a Hitler or God’s world.

30:58.049 --> 30:59.049
It’s your desire.

30:59.049 --> 31:04.889
You have to cleanse your hearts completely,
completely.

31:04.889 --> 31:09.399
Cleanse yourself.

31:09.399 --> 31:14.369
It’s not [that] you are possessed.

31:14.369 --> 31:16.779
Just think it over.

31:16.779 --> 31:21.179
It’s your own weaknesses and you think that
you can get away with it.

31:21.179 --> 31:25.059
You cannot get away with anything I tell you.

31:25.059 --> 31:27.739
God’s laws and statutes are very strict.

31:27.739 --> 31:35.450
That’s why all the gurus are so strict with
their disciples; extremely strict.

31:35.450 --> 31:40.759
Those who are real gurus, I am saying, those
who are not making money.

31:40.759 --> 31:44.349
Of course, those who are making money will
always pamper you.

31:44.349 --> 31:54.320
But those who are not making money, who are
true gurus, are very strict.

31:54.320 --> 31:59.870
Mostly they throw stones at their disciples.

31:59.870 --> 32:07.879
But I gave you flowers and you gave me stones!

32:07.879 --> 32:11.879
That is the best!

32:11.879 --> 32:21.950
It’s everything is only tongue deep, nothing
more!

32:21.950 --> 32:25.080
Nothing goes in the heart, that’s why.

32:25.080 --> 32:41.909
If you feel it from the heart, the need to
grow, then you will forget all these things.

32:41.909 --> 32:53.230
If you feel your Spirit you will feel that
need, that urge, to grow.

32:53.230 --> 33:06.590
Only your ego or superego is manifesting,
not your Spirit.

33:06.590 --> 33:19.470
If I say something, the best way to run away
from it is to feel bad about it.

33:19.470 --> 33:23.909
The second best would be to feel guilty about
it.

33:23.909 --> 33:31.980
But just detach yourself and become your Spirit
and think what have you been doing to yourself.

33:31.980 --> 33:34.629
Actually you are harming yourself every minute!

33:34.629 --> 33:44.779
You cannot harm me, you cannot harm Sahaj
Yog, these are all eternal things.

33:44.779 --> 33:52.740
They are eternal, they cannot be harmed, they
cannot be crucified, they cannot be killed,

33:52.740 --> 33:59.450
but you are covering your Spirit with darkness.

33:59.450 --> 34:06.679
I have never seen such things happening so
far.

34:06.679 --> 34:17.929
I mean, I have worked even in East Africa,
all over, but never, never such things.

34:17.929 --> 34:23.540
This is demonic I don’t know how you can
explain it.

34:23.540 --> 34:28.780
I didn’t know you were not keeping any accounts.

34:28.780 --> 34:31.829
I had no idea.

34:31.829 --> 34:33.929
I had no idea at all [that] you were keeping
no accounts.

34:33.929 --> 34:38.740
I had no idea that money was taken from others
and everybody coming here was paying and nobody

34:38.740 --> 34:42.169
knew what was paid, who was paid, who was
not paying.

34:42.169 --> 34:43.859
Nothing is known!

34:43.859 --> 34:56.059
I mean, I thought at least that much you can
manage among yourselves.

34:56.059 --> 35:04.220
And you know me, I am so particular about,
if you spend any money on me, how much I am

35:04.220 --> 35:10.840
anxious to pay you back – every single pie.

35:10.840 --> 35:14.680
If I have forgotten I don’t know, but if
I have not.

35:14.680 --> 35:18.059
I try to remember every single pie if you
spend.

35:18.059 --> 35:28.059
I mean, you are supposed to spend for your
guru, but I do not want you to spend a single

35:28.059 --> 35:30.579
pie on me!

35:30.579 --> 35:38.280
And if you spend I want to pay it back more
than what you have spent.

35:38.280 --> 35:43.800
Nobody does this way.

35:43.800 --> 35:53.650
And I remember ten times that it should be
paid.

35:53.650 --> 36:01.100
Telling false accounts and false things.

36:01.100 --> 36:08.100
I mean, I just can’t understand how can
Sahaja Yogis do it.

36:08.100 --> 36:15.170
Now, I wouldn’t be surprised if they take
to drinking or smoking or something.

36:15.170 --> 36:30.860
I mean, anything is possible under the sun.

36:30.860 --> 36:38.810
I mean, if you can do such depraved things,
you can do anything!

36:38.810 --> 36:43.539
After all you are free!

36:43.539 --> 36:46.462
This abandonment at this time is very dangerous.

36:46.462 --> 36:51.380
I had told you that, when the saints fall
they go very deep down, very deep down.

36:51.380 --> 36:52.809
So be careful: you are all saints now.

36:52.809 --> 36:53.920
Understand that, realise it.

36:53.920 --> 36:54.920
Assume your powers.

36:54.920 --> 37:07.099
Assume your seats, your thrones, and don’t
behave like beggars on the street or criminals.

37:07.099 --> 37:08.643
There is no excuse for such people.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.580
No excuse at all.

37:10.580 --> 37:20.000
Do not try to find excuses!

37:20.000 --> 37:38.079
There were so many people yesterday who were
not Sahaja Yogis and I didn’t want to say

37:38.079 --> 37:43.880
there, in their presence yesterday these things.

37:43.880 --> 38:03.510
But I came to know about these horrible things
which happened and I was amazed!

38:03.510 --> 38:08.619
Everything should be in the open in Sahaja
Yoga, I have told you a hundred times; not

38:08.619 --> 38:10.859
to hide anything.

38:10.859 --> 38:16.180
Accounts, everything should be written down.

38:16.180 --> 38:20.640
You will be amazed, when I go to India, you
will see, even Rahuri, it’s a village where

38:20.640 --> 38:23.339
there are people paying £5, £10.

38:23.339 --> 38:28.289
They make a book, when I go there, at my feet.

38:28.289 --> 38:36.270
They leave it with me for one day that, “Mother
please see it.

38:36.270 --> 38:39.630
You must see it.

38:39.630 --> 38:42.140
At least glance."

38:42.140 --> 38:44.660
I mean, imagine!

38:44.660 --> 38:47.280
These are uneducated, simple village folks
and they understand.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.180
Even my servant!

38:49.180 --> 38:54.340
My servant has so much sense!

38:54.340 --> 39:00.690
He’s so honest.

39:00.690 --> 39:09.150
No Sahaja Yogi should ever marry a Sahaja
Yogini.

39:09.150 --> 39:10.430
Better stop all that seeking.

39:10.430 --> 39:13.890
And now this nonsense has started now, working
out.

39:13.890 --> 39:20.289
As it is the problem of money management is
horrible and then if you start like this there

39:20.289 --> 39:21.400
cannot be, no more, any yogi left!

39:21.400 --> 39:33.059
It’s better to marry outside than to marry
a Sahaja Yogi and Sahaja Yogini.

39:33.059 --> 39:40.849
As if the bhoots go into geometrical progression
when they marry and they become so horrid

39:40.849 --> 39:46.160
and ugly; if there was a saint to be born
he’ll run away!

39:46.160 --> 39:47.510
Only the bhoots and the rakshasas will be
born to these people!

39:47.510 --> 39:48.710
That’s what I can see.

39:48.710 --> 39:55.730
The way they talk and the way they behave
it’s so funny.

39:55.730 --> 39:59.410
I can’t believe it that they are the same
Sahaja Yogis who were married the other day!

39:59.410 --> 40:09.610
(the marriage of Tony Paniotou and Dawn whom
Mother married on 4 July 1980)

40:09.610 --> 40:20.240
Every pie that is spent now has to be shown
to me because you do not count all those.

40:20.240 --> 40:23.099
No money should be borrowed from each other!

40:23.099 --> 40:30.400
Not a single pie.

40:30.400 --> 40:40.019
Everything that is financial, you have to
tell me.

40:40.019 --> 40:57.180
Everything that you are doing in the name
of Sahaja Yoga you have to tell me or in the

40:57.180 --> 41:05.390
group of Sahaja Yogis you must tell.

41:05.390 --> 41:06.720
You’d better not do anything on your own.

41:06.720 --> 41:07.869
Then you will be blessed.

41:07.869 --> 41:08.890
“Yoga kshema Vahamyaham” First yoga.

41:08.890 --> 41:09.890
First yoga.

41:09.890 --> 41:10.890
Achieve your yoga!

41:10.890 --> 41:14.610
All your problems will be solved.

41:14.610 --> 41:17.970
I promise you.

41:17.970 --> 41:22.450
First achieve your yoga.

41:22.450 --> 41:25.140
You have seen so many people.

41:25.140 --> 41:30.930
It has happened with so many.

41:30.930 --> 41:31.930
You know Regis’ case as you have seen.

41:31.930 --> 41:34.549
He could not get through his PhD.

41:34.549 --> 41:36.960
I only blessed his thesis.

41:36.960 --> 41:38.900
I didn’t even read!

41:38.900 --> 41:40.829
Nothing of the kind.

41:40.829 --> 41:43.730
Next day he became a Dr!

41:43.730 --> 41:48.720
I mean, there are so many cases, thousand
and one, you can see it, where yoga has helped.

41:48.720 --> 41:52.870
But yoga must be achieved and maintained and
respected.

41:52.870 --> 41:58.250
If you are not a yogi why should God bless
you?

41:58.250 --> 41:59.599
For what?

41:59.599 --> 42:05.410
Why should he bless you?

42:05.410 --> 42:07.839
Then the kshema also changes it’s form.

42:07.839 --> 42:09.390
There’s a lady who has written to me from
Australia.

42:09.390 --> 42:17.380
She wrote to me, “My grandmother is very
sick Mother and I don’t know what to do.

42:17.380 --> 42:21.799
And I want that she should be helped."

42:21.799 --> 42:29.289
And she wanted to do some operation or something
but she was so much better that they did not

42:29.289 --> 42:30.289
operate her.

42:30.289 --> 42:34.319
But she had to go on a nursing home and there
was no reservation, nothing; suddenly she

42:34.319 --> 42:41.559
got a call that there’s suddenly a reservation
for you and you come.

42:41.559 --> 42:51.339
I mean, this is one of the smallest things
that can happen.

42:51.339 --> 42:57.599
Yoga is to be established on two points.

42:57.599 --> 43:05.849
The sin against the Mother and the sin against
the Father.

43:05.849 --> 43:16.230
Sin against the Mother is when you do not
look after your chastity.

43:16.230 --> 43:20.940
Your attention has to be pure and purer and
purest.

43:20.940 --> 43:36.790
And the sin against the Father is when you
try to make money here and there: cut corners

43:36.790 --> 43:44.539
and try to save money and run after money
and worry about it.

43:44.539 --> 43:52.730
Any such enterprise, any such thing: underhand
dealings, high hand dealings, anything like

43:52.730 --> 43:58.050
that, is the sin against the Father.

43:58.050 --> 44:09.910
You are the people who have started believing,
also, that money is not important.

44:09.910 --> 44:15.670
So, according to them, if you make some frauds
it doesn’t matter, “After all money is

44:15.670 --> 44:16.710
not important so what?”

44:16.710 --> 44:27.720
And they have reached such conclusions.

44:27.720 --> 44:36.799
But in the name of God, to take a single pie
is a sin.

44:36.799 --> 44:44.760
In the same way, to mishandle even a single
pie while dealing with God – be careful,

44:44.760 --> 44:52.519
I am telling you!

44:52.519 --> 44:54.740
And grace cannot help you there!

44:54.740 --> 44:59.410
And this is a very sensitive point.

44:59.410 --> 45:06.910
For you it may not be, but for God it is.

45:06.910 --> 45:25.839
Those who make money in the name of God are
equally bad [as] those who try to do anything

45:25.839 --> 45:29.280
to hide money.

45:29.280 --> 45:34.619
It’s just the same.

45:34.619 --> 45:49.769
This is the work of God and you have to be
pure people, you have to be clean, beautiful,

45:49.769 --> 45:53.349
loving people, like children.

45:53.349 --> 46:01.890
Christ has said that you have to be like children
to be able to enter into the Kingdom of God.

46:01.890 --> 46:14.170
But you have entered and you’ll be thrown
back!

46:14.170 --> 46:21.869
There is more attention towards gaining more
power, like saying mantras after mantras,

46:21.869 --> 46:24.140
this, that, just to gain power.

46:24.140 --> 46:25.510
What power is this?

46:25.510 --> 46:29.609
The power is of innocence and of purity.

46:29.609 --> 46:36.150
There is no other power higher than this – of
simple innocence and purity.

46:36.150 --> 46:40.579
And you know that from me.

46:40.579 --> 46:45.829
An innocent person can never be harmed.

46:45.829 --> 47:04.869
Try to be humble and ask for innocence to
be re-established within you.

47:04.869 --> 47:21.390
A cunning man goes a very little way to his
doom, very fast.

47:21.390 --> 47:30.630
If somebody cheats you it does not matter
but if you cheat someone, you will be doubly

47:30.630 --> 47:44.130
punished because you are a yogi, you are wearing
the banner of God.

47:44.130 --> 47:48.050
Try to remember this.

47:48.050 --> 47:50.209
I do not think you should
