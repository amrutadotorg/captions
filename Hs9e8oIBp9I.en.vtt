00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:14.460
Today we have such a great opportunity to celebrate the birth of Christ.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.400
He was born in a manger.

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.150
All these things are already pre-planned.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:43.180
That He should be born in a manger in difficult situations,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.590
to show that whether you are born poor or rich,

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.960
whether you are born in difficulties or in problems,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.600
if you have Divinity within you it shines by itself.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:17.650
As the Christianity took a very wrong deviated line,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.870
they have never been able to understand the significance of Christ.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:35.050
To them Immaculate Conception is absolutely not possible.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.650
Most of the people think that it's some sort of a mythical story.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.860
But in India we do believe

00:01:47.070 --> 00:02:01.940
that Gauri created Shri Ganesha out of Her own vibrations

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.950
and that He became the Deity of Mooladhara.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.800
We accept it. But not in the West.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.960
They will never accept such a thing

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.320
because their mental side is over-developed and dominates them.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.740
Maybe they are not so very old like Indians

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.620
to understand that above all is God.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.540
Even the concept of God is quite mental.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.430
Moreover, the way Christianity has been,

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.620
it has not provided any proper guidance.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.830
On the contrary, whenever they have failed they said: "It's a mystery."

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.450
But it's very simple to understand for Indians,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.220
that anything is possible for God.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.340
After all He is God. He is God Almighty.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:21.260
Because of this mental attitude which is much lower

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.070
than the knowledge of your Spirit,

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.580
the ordinary, mundane type of this superficial knowledge

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:39.920
can never allow the personality to accept the greatness of God.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.520
I had a grandma. She was My father's aunt

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.430
and she used to tell us a nice story about somebody who was going to meet God.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.070
Of course this - in India everybody understands all these things.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.270
They will not say: "How is he going to meet God?" but they accept, you see:

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.850
“All right, he is going to meet God”.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.060
So when he was going on the way, on the road, he found one gentleman

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.350
sitting there, nicely singing songs, bhajans of God,

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.200
doing nothing on the roadside.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.310
So he said: "Oh, so you are going to meet God?"

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.470
"Yes, I am going to meet Him. So have you any message for Him?"

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.440
"Yes, please tell Him that I'm all right,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.150
but He should arrange for my food, because I think the food is now finishing."

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.850
He said: "Really, that's what you want me to tell Him?"

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:49.240
"Yes, yes, please tell Him. Oh, of course He'll arrange, but please tell Him."

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.140
So he went ahead and he met another gentleman

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.430
who was standing on his head, or in a Christian way I would say

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.420
he was going to church every day with nice suits, and singing hymns every day,

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.760
listening to the pastor's sermons, or whatever you may say;

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.540
and in the Indian way we can say he was going to the temple every day,

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.420
standing on his head, doing all kinds of yoga asanas and everything.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.450
And he asked him: "Please go and ask God - I've tried everything.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.160
When is He going to meet me? I would like to see Him.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.960
I would like to have His darshan." He said: "All right."

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.770
So he went to God,

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.310
and whatever work he had he finished with it,

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.220
and then God asked him: "Have you got anything to tell Me?"

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:47.390
He said: "Nothing much, but I met one gentleman while coming

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.420
and he said that 'I'm doing all kinds of things, I have tried everything,

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.350
and when will God meet me? I am standing on my head,

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:58.730
and I am doing also all kinds of yoga asanas, and all kinds of things,

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.270
and also I am going to church and mosque, I am praying,

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.190
doing all sorts of prayers, but when will God meet me?'"

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.170
So God said: "Tell him he has to do little more.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.390
See, it's not easy. When Sahaja Yoga will come we'll see!"

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.600
So then even he said: "And there’s another one who was on the road, You see.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.800
He was just enjoying himself singing songs,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.950
he suddenly saw me, and he told me:

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.120
'You see, my food is now finishing, ask God to arrange it for me.'"

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.340
He said: "Really, is the food just finishing?" Immediately God said:

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.880
"What are you doing, why don't you go and look after him? His food is finishing."

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.200
"No, no, Sir, we yesterday only, we arranged it, all that."

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.480
He said: "All right, all right, doesn't matter." You see, he couldn't understand,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.680
you know, that this fellow who is trying all these things

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.900
and God is still saying that he has to wait.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.550
And while this fellow is just singing songs of God and all that,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.870
and why is it so much impressed by this another fellow

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.310
who is doing nothing to seek God?

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.750
So then God realized that he is in some sort of an illusion.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.650
So He told him: "All right, you go and tell them one thing.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:28.330
To both of them the same thing, that 'When I went to God what I saw there

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:36.800
was that He made a camel pass through the eye of a needle.'"

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.680
So he said: "Really, I should tell them?"

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.970
"Yes, yes, you just tell them, and see the reaction."

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.340
So he went down. So this is, the first one met him, he said: "What God has said?"

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.250
He said that God has said: "Wait till Sahaja Yoga comes in, then I'll meet you.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.870
Before that you go round like this."

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.120
"Oh God, when will this Sahaja Yoga come?"

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:00.710
And he said: "So, but He'll meet me sometime?

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:05.530
I hope Sahaja Yoga also comes some time."

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.480
And he was quite disappointed.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:13.220
So he went and he asked him that: "What did you see with,

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.770
there when you went to see God?" He said: "I saw that, you know,

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.970
He passed a camel through the eye of an, of a needle."

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:25.010
He said: "What? How is it possible? It's impossible!" -

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.960
Now mental - "How is it possible,

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.130
that a camel can pass through the eye, it's not possible,

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:36.580
see the volume of this one and such a little thing. How can he pass?

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.580
No, no, no, no you are just telling me a story because you have been to God,

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.810
you are trying to show off, that's all. I, I don't believe in all this nonsense.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:47.510
You see, you are just telling me lies, and don't try to befool me."

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:52.320
So he went to another person who was on the street eating nicely.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.300
He said: "How are you?" "Oh, I know He had arranged before you reached there,

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.700
I know it was all right after all. You see, He looks after me all the time.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:05.400
So what did you see when you went there?" He said: "I saw that God Almighty

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:12.390
passed a camel through an eye of a needle. It's a very amazing thing."

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:17.800
He said: "What amazing thing? He is God, do you know He is God?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.880
Do you know He is God? God can do anything. He can do anything!"

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:33.440
That's made him understand, that if you understand that God is all-powerful -

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.840
all-powerful, it doesn't mean that He can move Himalayas to Maharashtra.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.160
It doesn't mean that!

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:54.160
But it means He is all powerful.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.260
Means He can do subtlest and subtlest thing, and such things

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:03.620
which our brain, this mental side cannot understand.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:09.710
It's beyond the conception of a human mind.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:15.100
This is what God is.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:17.940
He is the One who has created human beings.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.170
He has to be beyond us if He is creating.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:23.620
If a potter creates a pot that means he is beyond the pot.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:27.350
Pot cannot create God... the potter.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:33.050
And the potter has created the pot, so that means that this pot

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:38.190
which is created by him has to be - something which is made by him,

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:43.750
so he has to be much more powerful than the pot is.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:52.870
But it is unbelievable, or say, beyond the conception of human beings,

00:10:53.070 --> 00:11:02.820
that what a God it must be Who has made this great computer.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.390
We take everything for granted.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:13.510
We cannot even make a particle of clay ourself.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.230
We cannot make anything, human beings cannot make.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.450
Ha, if there is some stone, all right, you can put this up.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:25.420
If there is some clay, you can make some sort of a house out of it.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.010
But it’s all dead from the dead.

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:43.310
But can you make a candle which will burn badhas?

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:54.780
You have seen it with your own eyes that before My photograph the badhas burn.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.040
Can you do that?

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:07.200
Now you, we have no, also the idea of the complete, intricate working,

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:18.690
delicate machinery, and also very dynamic explosive machinery,

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:24.370
how it works to create human beings, to create all this universe,

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:31.700
to create all these beautiful flowers and trees and everything.

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:36.670
Look at the stars. Look at how many they are.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:41.840
Out of that He has chosen this Mother Earth to create human beings.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:45.460
How He has made it?

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:56.630
When He wants to send His own Son, He can send it the way He wants to send it.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:10.270
Even to challenge this shows the mental mind which is in, absolutely in mud.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.060
So to accept it is only possible

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.220
when you have saints, real saints who tell you,

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:29.910
that this is how Shri Ganesha was born out of Gauri.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.410
But to jump into it, into faith,

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:44.740
when you come to Sahaja Yoga, you start seeing miracles taking place.

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:50.110
Then you can understand that these miracles are taking place

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:56.400
and if there is another miracle that has to take place it will take place in any case.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.070
We are not doing anything, it’s all done.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.240
And we don't doubt it. Once you doubt you become again the same

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:15.730
human being which is just embedded in the mud.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.000
I always say that you are like lotuses now opened out.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.910
You are not flying in the air. Your roots are down there.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:31.420
But you are now lotuses,

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:38.830
and that's what is on top of the lotus, this Mahalakshmi principle is born.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:45.540
Mahalakshmi principle is the One which came on this earth

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:56.840
as Sitaji, as Radha and also as Mary, as Mother Mary.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:02.990
It's said that Mahalakshmi is born out of the sea.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:09.960
What is the meaning of "Mary"? Maria means, you know, Marine means "the sea".

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.410
She was born out of the sea.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:21.280
So She being a Mahalakshmi Herself, She could create a child. What's the harm?

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.270
She could do anything,

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:33.190
and this is the thing you have to rise above.

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:37.320
Christians have to rise above this Christianity,

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.520
and has to understand that it's such a great thing that was Christ

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:48.240
Who came on this earth, Who was the Incarnation of the principle of Ganesha.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.360
Ganesha becoming Mahavishnu is a very big thing

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.640
which one should try to understand.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:01.710
Ganesha is the Son of Shiva.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:14.540
Shri Ganesha is the One Who was first created before creating anything,

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:22.610
any atmosphere, anything, because He is the Omkara,

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:28.840
and the Omkara is the first breaking of Adi Shakti from Shiva.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:33.950
That sound, "Tan-kar", as they call it. From there started Omkara

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:39.200
and He is the One Who is the embodiment of that Omkara.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:43.230
So this sound is Shri Ganesh, is His power,

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:51.740
was created first foremost thing, just to create holiness, pavitrata.

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:56.180
When this holiness was created, this pavitrata was created,

00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:03.250
then everything was created in the sea of that holiness.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:12.570
And then He incarnated as Christ, but as Mahavishnu,

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:18.270
not as Shiva's Son, but as Mahavishnu.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:26.190
And who is Vishnu? He is an uncle of Shri Ganesh.

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:34.150
His Mother's brother is Shri Vishnu.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:41.040
So the, it was brought up, we should say, by Mahavishnu, we can say,

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:47.890
but Mahalakshmi adopted the principle of Shri Ganesh.

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:51.190
In the Kundalini chart you can see that the Shri Ganesha

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:56.300
is connected on the left-hand side to the Ida Nadi,

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.740
and the Kundalini is above that.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:11.010
So now what has happened is this, that He transcended that part,

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.910
and if He had to come for the redemption,

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:19.180
He had to come as the Son of Mahalakshmi.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.760
So it was Mahalakshmi who adopted Him,

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:30.630
or we should say, really conceived Him within Himself as Christ,

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.440
and He became Mahavishnu.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:45.160
Anything is possible in the family of Gods and Goddesses, because they are Gods.

00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:52.710
It is beyond human mind to understand how these things

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:59.540
are working out in that realm. Very difficult.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:03.790
But now you have got Realization, you can feel in the cool breeze,

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:08.360
so many new things are happening to you. So now believe Me,

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:13.530
that there is no unholy alliances

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.680
among the Gods and Goddesses, no unholy alliances.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.640
There is nothing that is human in them.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:28.100
They are all divine, pure people.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.510
Once you understand this point, then you will understand

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:43.850
why Shri Ganesha had to accept to be a Son of Mahalakshmi,

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:48.390
was born to Him as Christ.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:56.150
Because He had to come on Agnya, and for the redemption,

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:01.930
as Ganesha, He doesn't do the redemption part,

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:10.400
because at that stage He is for the innocence, for the holiness,

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:17.740
for the wisdom or also for destroying a negativity.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:23.720
But He had to come up; only He,

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:34.100
only Ganesha could be brought to this very constricted chakra, Agnya chakra.

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:38.040
Now why is it constricted? It's quite a scientific thing

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.890
which I would not like to discuss today.

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:43.570
But it had to be constricted

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:47.090
and it goes on getting more constricted, this Agnya chakra,

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:54.610
the more, the more we think, the more we go into the left or right,

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:59.360
it goes on really becoming like this, absolutely like this.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:07.440
So in this very subtle area only Christ could be settled,

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.780
because He is the subtlest of subtle.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:18.350
He's even subtler than an atom, because in the atom

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:23.130
those vibrations which move asymmetric and symmetric movements

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:28.210
are subtler than the atom.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.630
And this is the subtler of that also.

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:36.880
So in that little very constricted area,

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:46.700
only a personality like Christ, which is nothing but purity.

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:59.380
There is no other element in Him but purity.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:08.590
All other Incarnations have all the five elements in it.

00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:15.390
He has nothing. He is nothing but pure vibrations.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:19.320
That's why He could walk on the water,

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:27.520
because there was no mass in His body, no matter in His body. No matter.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:33.050
No element, except for Chaitanya itself.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:38.640
Omkara becoming Ganesha in the mud,

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:44.280
or the what you can say, the thing that came out of Her body.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:49.080
Only the Chaitanya. So at Ganesha's stage we can say

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.970
that the Chaitanya was kept in that form,

00:22:54.170 --> 00:23:00.830
but in the state of Christ it was no longer there.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:09.690
But the whole drama was played later on, of His death and resurrection,

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:13.940
because He is the One who is responsible for our resurrection,

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:19.480
because He is the Gate. He is the Path because He is Shri Ganesh.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:25.880
Omkara is the Path, and He is the Gate, but He is not the destination.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.540
His Mother is the destination.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:39.450
Even Mahalakshmi is not the Destination. Even Mahakali, Mahasaraswati.

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:45.140
It's the Adi Shakti is the destination where you have to reach.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.280
All these things were never told in the Bible

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:56.050
because He could hardly live for four years with public life.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:00.850
Nor did they want to tell about it because they did not know.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:07.680
Also there was a definite suppression of all Divine things,

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.520
for these people are all commercialized institutions,

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.670
as we have also in India all kinds of commercial institutions.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:22.300
But the only advantage in India is that religion is not organized.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.120
Thank God for that!

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.710
But they organized it, they organized Christ,

00:24:27.910 --> 00:24:30.670
they organized all His principles, everything,

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:34.350
and now they think He was a good human being.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:37.700
What a certificate to give!

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:45.310
So today we are here to celebrate the birth of Omkara.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:50.610
It's a very big thing. I don't know if you can realize it, what it is,

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:58.230
which moves into everything, whether it is anu, paramanu, is the atom, molecules,

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:05.700
into all the organizing of chemicals and also the periodic laws,

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:15.060
and also in the gravity, into everything that moves is this Omkara,

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:20.370
and your vibrations are nothing but Omkaras.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.740
Actually, in My photograph the vibrations have come as Omkaras.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:30.420
On the head of the people there is Omkara written.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.910
How is it happening, these lights look like Omkara?

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.470
How is it on top of the heads of the Sahaja Yogis,

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.490
there's - all the Sahaja Yogis' heads - there is Omkara?

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:52.570
Or Allah in Arabic language, My name also, in Arabic?

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.680
Who is doing this?

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:04.270
It is He who is doing all those things.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:13.780
So Omkara itself takes a form to do things to convince you of Adi Shakti.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:21.480
He is the One who is handling all these powers.

00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:28.290
He doesn't enter into the photograph, no, He does not,

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:32.150
but He plays a trick.

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:38.390
After all you see, if you go into details, how do you get a photograph?

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:43.970
Through the light. The light passes straight, in a straight line.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:48.710
But if He wants, He can make the light pass another way round.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:52.470
He can just transform the light into something else.

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:55.760
He can do whatever He likes.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:27:00.140
And that's what He does to convince you.

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:03.540
And He said that "Anything against Me I'll tolerate,

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.310
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:11.860
And this Holy Ghost is the Adi Shakti.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:20.650
Without Him you cannot go to the Sahasrara.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:24.100
So the in the whole play He is like the sutra dhara,

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:28.100
He is the One who is the conductor,

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:34.860
the One moves the strings in a puppet show.

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.930
And so it is very important to pray to Shri Ganesha,

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.980
every time we have Puja, we have to pray to Him

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:47.680
and we, that's how we are praying to Lord Jesus Christ. Every time.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:53.240
Without His auspiciousness, without His help, we cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:53.450 --> 00:28:00.000
He is the Manager. See, I am sitting here and He is the manager.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.140
Supposing there is no management, how will I speak here?

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:07.560
Nothing can happen. But He is so efficient,

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:12.720
and you never see Him working out everything, doing everything.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:18.090
You all would not have understood everything I said in English.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.830
And today is Jesus Christ’s birthday.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:28.390
Jesus Christ, what a great personality He is, that’s what I was telling them.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:34.300
We people pray to Shri Ganesha, worship Him, because others told us to do so.

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:38.130
But what is He? Who is Shri Ganesha?

00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:41.540
We say that He is Omkara. What is Omkara?

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:48.500
All the functions of this whole universe, are done by the power of this Omkara,

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.360
which we call as “chaitanya”, as “Bramha chaitanya”.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:57.450
The physical manifestation of Brahma chaitanya is Omkara,

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.580
and the idol form of that,

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.860
or the iconic form of that, is Shri Ganesha.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.540
And the incarnation of that (Brahma chaiytnya)

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:09.070
is Jesus Christ.

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:13.400
If you understand this point,

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:18.050
we sing frantically people when we worship Shri Ganesha.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.350
We should realize what we are saying in each and every word.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.510
We are describing His powers.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:28.630
Why are we doing this?

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:33.290
Whoever has powers, supposing I have some powers, and you have some powers,

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:36.050
then what is the need to describe them?

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.490
So that we also achieve those powers,

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.700
and with those powers, we also become powerful.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.170
That is why we worship Shri Ganesha.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.560
The greatest of His powers is purity.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.190
Anything that is pure is most powerful..

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:54.360
Nobody can touch it.

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.710
For example, a soap. No matter how many times you use it,

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.500
or wash it with anything, it doesn’t get dirty.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.430
For once, even soap may also get dirty,

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.680
but this Omkar is holy, pure,

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.320
and eternal being,

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:18.560
or it is a power, which can work eternally.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:24.110
When you worship this power, you should remember,

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:28.170
that, we want to absorb this power within us,

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:32.470
so that, we become completely pure and all our chakras get cleared.

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:34.630
Our lives become pure,

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:41.740
our society, politics, country, and the whole world get purified.

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.780
And in that purity lies the joy.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.010
When something becomes very clean,

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:50.320
for example when you have a bath and you wear a clean dress,

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.940
then you feel very nice.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.800
But, when your whole life,

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:58.190
gets purified by this Omkar,

00:30:58.810 --> 00:30:59.770
then..

00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:05.320
..we call it as “Atmanand”, (joy of spirit), we achieve that.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.240
And in the atma (spirit) also,

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.640
the prevailing power is that of “Omkara” only.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:18.300
But we do not understand what Omkara is.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:23.770
We just say it is something like “ardha matra” (half a syllable).

00:31:24.390 --> 00:31:28.040
But, we don’t understand what exactly it is.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:35.480
And these four powers,”chatvari”, which are Shri Ganesha’s powers,

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:42.280
you see the advent of the same in the life of Jesus Christ

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.980
But He was alive only for four years.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:53.880
And somehow, people were not much aware about him in India,

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:57.820
But in western countries, people started following Him.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.760
Now these people have only brain and nothing else.

00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:04.790
They have no heart, nothing, but only brain.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.650
So in that brain,

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:12.000
how can such a subtle thing enter?

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.550
To understand this subtle thing

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.810
in the mind of a human being,

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:24.600
the intellect should awaken, meaning,

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:29.000
within him that sensitivity should come,

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:38.140
by which he gets filled, with abundance of light.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:40.170
Gets flooded with light.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:41.980
In that light...

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:47.300
normally, you see that when this light is falls on eyes, it blinks off.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.340
But the light that comes from within,

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:54.390
doesn’t blur your eyes, but in that light everything is visible.

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.600
To achieve that enlightenment of the spirit,

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:02.910
You see the agnya chakra, this chakra is exactly above the “Medha” (brain).

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:04.330
This is Medha,

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:07.880
which is known as brain plate, agnya chakra is on it here.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.760
When Medha opens,

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.860
meaning Medha is like this “closed”.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.970
When it opens, that is when we say agnya chakra has opened.

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:21.400
And when kundalini comes up from inside this,

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.660
and when it covers the upper part of Medha,

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:28.980
then in the intellect of human being

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:32.430
a special...

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:35.870
which is beyond human being,

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:38.530
beyond the intelligence of human,

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:45.470
a special divine power, gets awakened.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:48.070
And with this divine power

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:53.470
you start understanding what is truth and what is untruth.

00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:57.380
You feel the same power in your hands also.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:00.870
Gradually, you don’t even have to check your hands for anything,

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:03.210
you will know it just like that.

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:06.340
You will at once understand this is false or that is good.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:10.330
But some people start understanding this very soon,

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:14.700
I say that such people have been blessed by Jesus Christ.

00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:18.430
And some people remain stuck in the vortex of mind.

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:21.840
For example, being stuck in useless religions,

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:23.500
or in caste and creed,

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:28.050
and thinking that “I like Indians only” or “I like English only”.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:32.450
These kind of thoughts, narrow mindedness, conservatism,

00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.580
And miserliness and many others.

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:40.800
Especially, our country, is full of many kind of parasites, mosquitoes, bugs, (referring to humans)

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.110
which are not found anywhere else.

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:47.500
Whatever (nonsense) is found here, is not found anywhere else.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:51.980
To what extent, a human can fall into a pit,

00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:55.190
one can see only in this country. Sometimes it is very surprising,

00:34:55.390 --> 00:34:58.170
that in the country where great incarnations took birth,

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.210
the culture of which is full of devotion,

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:07.220
where Lord is worshipped, in such a place, by this kind of filth,

00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:11.040
and this kind of conservative attitude,

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:15.050
we are decaying ourselves and continuing do so.

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:18.090
After coming to Sahaja Yoga, we should leave all this at least.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:22.020
But even now this caste creed, and all such things,

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.200
is still making us like insects (lower beings).

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:30.120
So this “Vishwa Nirmal Dharma”, this religion

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:33.970
is that of “Omkara”, is that of holiness.

00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:37.070
In this, if you are still continuing with all these things,

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.070
then you can not get into this "dharma", And no matter how much you say,

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:46.280
that, “We worship Mataji, we use Her photo, and we follow Her"

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:52.770
By this neither you are going to gain anything,

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.210
nor the world is going to benefit anything.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.210
It is something like if a lamp says..

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:01.800
”I have light, so I am giving light to everyone”.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.220
What if someone asks, ”Where is your light? Show us.”

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:08.520
We are deceiving ourselves.

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:12.790
So whoever is in Sahaja Yoga, first they should completely convince themselves,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.520
that now we are not going to deceive ourselves.

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:19.920
“We are going to leave this completely and get deeper into Sahaja Yoga”.

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:22.930
Only then you will benefit out of it.

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:27.800
I also see what happens to the half baked people.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:35.460
It is possible that because of going to some Guru you may have problems.

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:40.110
Or because of the wrong company also you may have problems.

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:47.390
Because now we are in that era, which we call as "Kruti Yuga",

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:51.920
where this brahma chaitanya (vibrations) has become active. It works.

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:53.880
Now you,

00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:59.110
can neither deceive yourself nor you can cheat Me.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:04.410
Whoever adopts the path of deception, will bear the consequences.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:09.370
One gentleman came to me and said,

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:12.840
“Mother, when I meditate, my face becomes this big”.

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.550
I said, ”Is that so?,

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:18.630
How does it look like?" He said, “Like Hanumana”

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.390
I said,  "It's good right that you are becoming like Hanumana”.

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:23.590
He said, “No Mother, I feel worried that my face may burst."

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.690
“You chew tobacco, right”?

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.380
“Yes, That is right”.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.480
I said, ”Then chew tobacco, why do you meditate”?

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:34.610
“You want to chew tobacco and meditate as well,

00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:37.080
then obviously the face will bloat."

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:44.910
Another gentleman came, and said ”See Mother, my this finger is cut”.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.570
“Alright, were you smoking?”

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:50.460
He said, “Yes”. “So this finger of mine got hurt”.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.820
Another man met with a car accident.

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:57.080
He came and told that “Mother, only this finger is gone”.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.730
“Only this is hurt (index finger) because I smoke”.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:04.210
You come to Sahaja Yoga and still smoke and consume liquor.

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:06.430
And you do all other things,

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.960
And you claim to be a Sahaja Yogi, roaming around with a big badge.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:15.160
The same badge which you are wearing, is going to break your head, let me warn you.

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.390
If you think that it is a simple thing to wear a badge, then it is not so.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.130
The badge which you are wearing

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:25.390
will break your head, which I don’t want, I don't break.

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:29.440
But understand that this badge is not an ordinary thing.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:34.050
It has a coefficient. Meaning, vibrations flow out of it.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.550
The same vibrations, if encircles your throat and strangles you,

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.000
then you will say, “Mother, I was sleeping with the badge on,

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.260
then how did this happen to me?

00:38:42.660 --> 00:38:46.150
The same badge that you were wearing, came out and broke your skull.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.500
So don’t put on the badge.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.950
But if you want to use it, then be worthy of it.

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:56.250
These days everyone says ”Mother, give a badge,

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:58.790
we want to wear it in the neck as locket."

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:02.600
See, you wear it but with caution, do you get it?

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.800
Don’t blame it on me later that,

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:10.480
"Mother, I wore this and went, still I slipped and my leg broke“.

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:13.720
That badge only made you slip, so don’t wear it.

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:15.150
If you want to wear it,

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.140
then you should be eligible and worthy of it.

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:22.230
And if you are not worthy,

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:25.440
then God save you from Jesus Christ.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.430
And Shri Ganesha is even ahead of Him.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.780
He has the axe ('parshu") in His left hand and can hit easily, then what can I do?

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:37.470
Now, He will not listen to me, since you have worn it,

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:40.660
then He says, “Now face the consequence”.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.480
So, to wear this badge,

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:44.980
or,

00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.500
to wear the pendant, to wear the ring,

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.720
Oh my God! Be very careful!

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:55.090
When you go to washroom, remove them

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.110
and keep carefully.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.080
About My hair also I have told people to be careful please.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:05.920
These hair have been given by “Yama” (God of death).

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:07.870
He is always behind them.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:10.710
So, please, if you see them lying anywhere,

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:13.030
be kind enough to return them to Me.

00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:17.150
I don’t want you to face any problem, because I am a mother also.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.820
But these people (deities) are not your mother or father.

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:23.350
They are your brothers.

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.760
They move around you with a stick.

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:32.400
So understand that if you have come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:36.200
It is so joy giving with bhajan and all..

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.430
but then from where did you get hit?

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:43.170
So that’s why,

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:46.460
the specialty of Sahaja Yoga should be understood,

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:49.140
that this is the knowledge of the God Almighty.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:52.840
The Almighty God is not a Mother.

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:57.380
Mother is all affectionate.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:59.850
She understands that these are my children,

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:02.950
sometimes they do this or do that, it’s alright.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.520
But,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.090
The God Almighty is watching,

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:13.070
how you all are behaving?

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:20.470
And after a lot of hard work, I, your Mother gave you Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:25.160
Then where are you still lacking?

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:29.190
What mistake are you doing now?

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:33.600
And so you should act with understanding.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:39.630
But, I would say that, Adishakti is definitely the power of the God almighty,

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:42.050
She is His desire.

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.400
But, The God almighty, is watching,

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.610
that all the hard work that is being done,

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:51.180
and in the drama created by Her,

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.150
how many are real and fake.

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:58.230
And He is noting, who all should be put right.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.040
Whoever is good, also should be noted, is it?

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.520
It’s not like that.

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:07.570
But whoever is insincere, He will catch them.

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.860
And He will give everybody a blow.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:11.670
That is why, please,

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:16.180
whatever you do, do with a clean heart, a open heart

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:20.780
Whatever I have told you, that if you have blind faith,

00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:23.200
or if you still have casteism within you,

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:26.440
or if you have “we Indians are great” kind of feeling within you,

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:28.640
Or any such feeling,

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:31.400
which are false, which have no purity,

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:35.460
You get rid of all such feelings, and then wear my pendant, please!

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:39.080
Because with each pendant one “Gana” is attached.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.380
And they (ganas) are around you.

00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.490
They always protect you,

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:49.190
In this way also, they protect you from doing wrong things.

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:56.210
Because, they know you in and out.

00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:02.330
So, today it was important to give you this warning.

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:06.080
Otherwise also, it is a very happy occasion,

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:11.990
that if, Jesus Christ had not come in this world,

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.100
and if he had not taken his seat on Agnya Chakra,

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.130
and made the path to salvation,

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.050
path of resurrection, then Sahaja Yoga wouldn’t have been possible.

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:27.460
It was very essential that He took birth.

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:30.780
But they (incarnations) have no fight among themselves.

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:33.310
They are all born on one single tree,

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:36.280
on a living tree they all took birth,

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:40.900
and this tree was nurtured, to come up to Sahasrara,

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.500
and at that Sahasrara, it could be worked out.

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:47.460
But if there is no tree, then how can Sahasrara be there?

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:52.500
And if the Sahasrara is there, then this tree has created that Sahasrara.

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:57.390
So, it is the responsibility of the tree also to take care of the Sahasrara,

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:03.570
and protect it completely, and punish those who go against it.

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:12.720
So, this day is of special importance, for all of you,

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.610
because if Jesus Christ had not come,

00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:17.750
then, our resurrection wouldn’t have happened.

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:22.780
It is said to Shri Ganesha that when our time for "moksha" comes,

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:24.760
you please protect us.

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:26.460
It is commonly said.

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.320
That You (Shri Ganesh) protect us at the time of "Moksha".

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:36.480
At the time of "Moksha", he manifests on Agnya chakra and gives you protection.

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:42.840
So today’s day is very auspicious for all of us,

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:46.440
very joy giving day also,

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:50.570
and at the same time cautions us also, that “Be careful”.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:53.780
And if you get stuck in “Agnya chakra”,

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:56.820
then you will end up either in a mental asylum,

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:03.030
or you will get some other disease.

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:07.890
Agnya chakra's purity should be intact, means our thoughts should always be pure.

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:12.550
If impure thoughts come, then we should keep on forgiving them.

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:14.990
Thoughts should always be pure.

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:19.350
And as you start ascending, you will not get impure thoughts,

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.560
only pure thoughts will come.

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:27.360
Sahaja Yoga is made only for your joy,

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:30.490
for your greatness,

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:32.390
for your dignity,

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:36.570
and for your over all progress.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:41.720
But it is also there that, whosoever,

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:46.700
for this great work,

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:51.510
and for the people who are completely attached with this work,

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:56.660
whosoever, does not co-operate and provide their support,

00:45:57.170 --> 00:45:59.920
they may also get into troubles.

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:04.000
Those who are doing this work wholeheartedly,

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.260
you should support them wholeheartedly.

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:12.500
In many people now I am noticing the disease of miserliness.

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:19.090
There are people who will even save Rs.4 if they can by any means.

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:24.260
If you try to save 4 rupees, you will lose at least 400 rupees,

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:25.710
just like that.

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:31.570
And even 1 rupee given in Sahaja Yoga, can be equal to 1 lakh rupees.

00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:34.910
Meaning, even one rupee can be enough, that’s what I am telling you.

00:46:35.312 --> 00:46:38.240
But we are not giving anything, everything belongs to Mother,

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.150
we are giving to Mother, what is Hers.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.450
And, I don’t take anything, you know that I try to resist daily,

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:45.120
that don’t give me presents,

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.750
I don’t want anything, don’t give Me sarees,

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:50.620
From morning to evening, since 5 years the struggle is going on,

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:53.850
no one listens, I have been asking them to reduce buying gifts,

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:57.600
Now the prices also are increasing, and I don’t need anything.

00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:01.240
But for Sahaja Yoga money is required.

00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:06.810
But even such people exist, who feel great about eating free food.

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:14.280
Later if they have stomach problem, then I am not responsible for that.

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.960
And this place is not for beggars.

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:25.660
This is for people who are wealthy by attitude.

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:28.200
If you have the attitude of a king, then come here.

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.790
There is no need that you should have money.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.460
Many rich people are extremely miserly,

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:36.670
and so peculiar that it is difficult to understand them,

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:39.090
And many poor people are like Me,

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:42.450
that they find joy in just giving to others.

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.830
When your one hand opens you take from it.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.570
But only when the other hand opens to give, you will get from the first hand,

00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:50.630
otherwise it will stop flowing.

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:56.160
When I hear about miserliness, I feel so disgusted, you cannot imagine.

00:47:58.670 --> 00:48:02.740
But, I liked it the other day, when there was nothing to give,

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:05.550
people accepted my photo with affection.

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:09.440
“Mother, please give us your photo this time". It felt so good.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.040
That contentment,

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.600
should come first.

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:19.680
Nobody can do what Jesus Christ did, but after getting content, a human being,

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:23.760
is able to sacrifice happily.

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:26.770
It may be a bit difficult, but it doesn’t matter.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.320
But we all are part of a great mission.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.920
And not just for us, we are doing it for all others.

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:37.740
Next year I am going to get your name list.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:41.000
and I want to see, specially, about the complain on Mumbai people,

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:44.320
that, they completely refuse to pay money.

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:48.050
And see ironically, Mahalakshmi temple is in Mumbai.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.580
What is the benefit of that Mahalakshmi temple?

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:54.350
Where Mahalakshmi Herself came out of the earth,

00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:59.340
and people of such place are so miserly that, they do not want to pay at all,

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:04.500
thinking that Mother is doing everything, so come, let us just relax and enjoy.

00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:08.480
As such everything will happen whether they pay or not,

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:11.300
But what will happen to them,

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:13.200
think of that.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:21.340
The Mahalakshmi principle is that, when we find contentment inside,

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:25.810
when the Lakshmi principle attains maturity, the Mahalakshmi principle gets awakened,

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.360
After which we start searching the truth.

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:32.320
If there is no contentment within you,

00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:35.560
you cannot attain the Mahalakshmi principle.

00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:42.150
Look at Seeta Ji’s life, how long did she stay with Ramchandra Ji?

00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:43.830
Radha Ji’s life,

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:47.890
And after that Shri Jesus Christ’s Mother’s life?

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.680
In all the three lives there is plenty of sacrifice.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:55.760
without great contentment, it is not possible.

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:59.230
So with the Mahalakshmi principle human becomes contented,

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:00.470
and

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:05.370
with this principle he seeks the truth,

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.600
And during this seeking, the falsehood goes away from him.

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:13.380
In today’s Mahalakshmi Puja,

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:18.900
where in we are worshipping Jesus Christ, and His Mother Mary

00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:22.000
then we should get into total contentment.

00:50:24.930 --> 00:50:29.800
When we get satisfied with materialistic things and worldly things,

00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:34.040
only then the Mahalakshmi principle awakens within us.

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:40.440
And then, the Mahalakshmi Principle manages the Lakshmi principle.

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:45.400
And Lakshmi Principle starts manifesting by itself,

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:50.080
works out by itself and gives the benefit automatically.

00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:53.680
Automatically everything constructive happens.

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:06.360
So, I just have to tell you that expand your heart,

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:08.440
make it large.

00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:11.960
And establish that Omkara within your heart,

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:16.470
establish the essence of the spirit, establish Jesus Christ and Ganesha,

00:51:16.770 --> 00:51:18.390
because of whom,

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:24.550
all our problems will be solved,

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:27.560
and your right on me will be established.

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:32.530
Without them I can not give you any right.

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:38.800
In the raising of Kundalini also, until, from the Mooladhara

00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:48.090
the permission doesn’t come, unless the Ganesha, present in mooladhar says: ” Yes”,

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:52.520
not only Me, but no one can raise the Kundalini.

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:56.760
These are His reserved rights.

00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:01.260
If anybody thinks that they are very close to Mother,

00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:04.490
then they should understand that even if they are close,

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:11.190
for real if they are close, then that is also with Shri Ganesha’s consent,

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:13.390
with Jesus Christ’s consent.

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:18.280
Without their consent, I can not accept anyone.

00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:20.610
This is a bondage among us,

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:25.200
that’s why I tell you again and again that “Be careful”.

00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:28.200
Their bondage has to be accepted.

00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:33.840
And whatever is their opinion about you,

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:36.440
whatever they think about you,

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:39.040
I have to take into consideration.

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:43.500
No matter how much I forgive, being a Mother, whatever I may say,

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:45.860
but I can't win over them. (Jesus and Ganesha).

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:51.880
And know that, “They” themselves will help you, will cleanse you,

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:54.010
will do everything for you,

00:52:54.210 --> 00:52:57.940
but “They” have one expectation from you, I have no expectations, I am without expectations,

00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:01.350
I don’t want anything from you, however you are it is fine.

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:07.520
But, “They” have one expectation that, if you say or do anything against Me,

00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:11.280
or if you do any kind of “pettiness” in Sahaja Yoga,

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:15.990
or you do any kind of cheating or any such thing, then “They” will be behind you.

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.290
That’s why I am telling you again and again,

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:20.770
that on this auspicious occasion,

00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:24.030
we should realize, that, such great powers are with us.

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:28.640
And why shouldn’t we accept these powers and live like an emperor?

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:32.680
And why should we be “Petty minded”, when we have such a big throne,

00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:35.170
then let us sit on the throne with dignity.

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:38.480
And let us live with that dignity, as we are supposed to.

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:41.430
Now you all are Sahaja Yogis, you are saints,

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:44.200
it is a very great thing, when were there so many Yogis?

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.800
And so many saints have come to “Ganapatipule”,

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:51.290
where Maha Ganesha is present, He is called Maha Ganesha.

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:53.190
And in the Maha Ganesha’s

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:59.140
family, we all have joined.

00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:01.960
We have come to His land.

00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:08.460
And with His blessings, His great powers can manifest within us as well.

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:13.400
But first of all, to withstand that power, His purity should be established.

00:54:14.050 --> 00:54:16.540
and there should be devotion (bhakti) like him.

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:22.440
They way His bhakti is, which has no selfishness of any kind.

00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:24.270
There is only Bhakti.

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:28.200
If we just become like that, then He takes care of everything else.

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.590
Then He is at your disposal to take care of you.

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:35.920
But if you go on the opposite side, He may also harm you.

00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:38.030
One such,

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:43.070
thing of wisdom, I am trying to explain you.

00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:49.760
Because a mother always feels that, These children of mine are very sweet,

00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:53.360
and you should only benefit from Them (deities).

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:58.240
Then I also fear that They do not hold you up by the ear.

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:01.800
That is why, I am explaining to you,

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:05.090
when we have created such beautiful atmosphere here,

00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:09.560
and gathered like one family,

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.470
and we all are together,

00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:17.440
then these elder brothers of yours should be honored by you,

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:21.520
that they are present and they should be recognized.

00:55:21.770 --> 00:55:26.210
And if you worship them and make them happy, it will be really good.

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.880
But they don’t get pleased so soon.

00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:32.800
Unless you are cleansed from within, they won’t be happy.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.760
So you clean yourself from within, and take a vow today

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:41.000
that, in future we will completely discard all types of pettiness,

00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:44.710
frivolous act, and trivial matters.

00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:48.800
And we shall look up to these deities’ greatness and purity

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.390
and consider them as our ideals and steer our lives in that direction.

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:56.400
If we do just this, we will be tremendously benefitted.

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.890
My infinite blessings to you.

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:03.090
And you all have come here with lots of love,

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:09.040
Your Mother can not say thanks to each one of you,

00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:12.560
but know that My heart is full,

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:15.420
and in this heart, you all are residing,

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:18.190
and I love you all too much.

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:22.080
and I look at you with immeasurable love.

00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:25.900
and my thoughts are always around your protection.

00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:29.800
My total attention and thoughts are towards you

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:35.040
and for any kind of problem you can write to me,

00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:37.770
but you yourself should become pure,

00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:40.240
you yourself become clean,

00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:46.400
and upon becoming auspicious, enjoy this bliss till eternity.
