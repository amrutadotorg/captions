00:00:03.393 --> 00:00:14.467
Today we have such a great opportunity
to celebrate the birth of Christ.

00:00:21.058 --> 00:00:26.404
He was born in a manger.

00:00:26.658 --> 00:00:32.155
All these things are already pre-planned.

00:00:35.644 --> 00:00:43.183
That He should be born in a manger
in difficult situations,

00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:48.591
to show that whether you are born
poor or rich,

00:00:48.792 --> 00:00:55.965
whether you are born in difficulties
or in problems,

00:00:56.166 --> 00:01:01.607
if you have Divinity within you it shines
by itself.

00:01:05.844 --> 00:01:17.657
As the Christianity took a very wrong
deviated line,

00:01:18.808 --> 00:01:24.878
they have never been able to understand
the significance of Christ.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:35.053
To them Immaculate Conception is absolutely
not possible.

00:01:35.254 --> 00:01:40.657
Most of the people think that it's some
sort of a mythical story.

00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:46.869
But in India we do believe

00:01:47.070 --> 00:02:01.949
that Gauri created Shri Ganesha out
of Her own vibrations

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.954
and that He became the Deity of Mooladhara.

00:02:08.155 --> 00:02:12.805
We accept it. But not in the West.

00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:14.969
They will never accept such a thing

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.329
because their mental side is over-developed
and dominates them.

00:02:24.265 --> 00:02:30.747
Maybe they are not so very old like Indians

00:02:30.948 --> 00:02:35.628
to understand that above all is God.

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.545
Even the concept of God is quite mental.

00:02:41.505 --> 00:02:45.438
Moreover, the way Christianity has been,

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:51.621
it has not provided any proper guidance.

00:02:51.822 --> 00:02:57.834
On the contrary, whenever they have failed
they said: "It's a mystery."

00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:04.459
But it's very simple to understand
for Indians,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.229
that anything is possible for God.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.343
After all He is God. He is God Almighty.

00:03:13.544 --> 00:03:21.262
Because of this mental attitude which
is much lower

00:03:21.463 --> 00:03:26.074
than the knowledge of your Spirit,

00:03:26.275 --> 00:03:30.581
the ordinary, mundane type of this
superficial knowledge

00:03:30.782 --> 00:03:39.927
can never allow the personality to accept
the greatness of God.

00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:46.526
I had a grandma. She was My father's aunt

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:54.435
and she used to tell us a nice story about
somebody who was going to meet God.

00:03:54.636 --> 00:03:58.070
Of course this - in India everybody
understands all these things.

00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:01.271
They will not say: "How is he going to meet
God?" but they accept, you see:

00:04:01.472 --> 00:04:02.852
“All right, he is going to meet God”.

00:04:03.053 --> 00:04:08.065
So when he was going on the way,
on the road, he found one gentleman

00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:14.351
sitting there, nicely singing songs,
bhajans of God,

00:04:14.552 --> 00:04:18.205
doing nothing on the roadside.

00:04:18.406 --> 00:04:21.317
So he said: "Oh, so you are going
to meet God?"

00:04:21.517 --> 00:04:26.476
"Yes, I am going to meet Him. So have
you any message for Him?"

00:04:26.677 --> 00:04:30.447
"Yes, please tell Him that I'm all right,

00:04:30.648 --> 00:04:37.156
but He should arrange for my food, because
I think the food is now finishing."

00:04:37.357 --> 00:04:40.853
He said: "Really, that's what you want
me to tell Him?"

00:04:41.054 --> 00:04:49.246
"Yes, yes, please tell Him. Oh, of course
He'll arrange, but please tell Him."

00:04:49.447 --> 00:04:53.146
So he went ahead and he met another
gentleman

00:04:53.347 --> 00:04:56.437
who was standing on his head, or
in a Christian way I would say

00:04:56.638 --> 00:05:01.422
he was going to church every day with nice
suits, and singing hymns every day,

00:05:01.623 --> 00:05:04.767
listening to the pastor's sermons, or
whatever you may say;

00:05:04.968 --> 00:05:08.540
and in the Indian way we can say he was
going to the temple every day,

00:05:08.741 --> 00:05:13.422
standing on his head, doing all kinds
of yoga asanas and everything.

00:05:13.623 --> 00:05:18.459
And he asked him: "Please go and ask
God - I've tried everything.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.169
When is He going to meet me? I would
like to see Him.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.966
I would like to have His darshan."
He said: "All right."

00:05:24.167 --> 00:05:29.779
So he went to God,

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:35.317
and whatever work he had he finished
with it,

00:05:35.518 --> 00:05:40.221
and then God asked him: "Have you got
anything to tell Me?"

00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:47.393
He said: "Nothing much, but I met one
gentleman while coming

00:05:47.594 --> 00:05:51.429
and he said that 'I'm doing all kinds
of things, I have tried everything,

00:05:51.644 --> 00:05:54.352
and when will God meet me? I am standing
on my head,

00:05:54.553 --> 00:05:58.737
and I am doing also all kinds of yoga
asanas, and all kinds of things,

00:05:58.938 --> 00:06:02.276
and also I am going to church and
mosque, I am praying,

00:06:02.477 --> 00:06:08.197
doing all sorts of prayers, but when will
God meet me?'"

00:06:08.398 --> 00:06:12.172
So God said: "Tell him he has to do little
more.

00:06:12.373 --> 00:06:17.397
See, it's not easy. When Sahaja Yoga
will come we'll see!"

00:06:28.512 --> 00:06:32.604
So then even he said: "And there’s another
one who was on the road, You see.

00:06:32.805 --> 00:06:35.802
He was just enjoying himself singing songs,

00:06:36.003 --> 00:06:37.950
he suddenly saw me, and he told me:

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.128
'You see, my food is now finishing, ask
God to arrange it for me.'"

00:06:41.329 --> 00:06:45.342
He said: "Really, is the food just
finishing?" Immediately God said:

00:06:45.543 --> 00:06:48.889
"What are you doing, why don't you go
and look after him? His food is finishing."

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:52.208
"No, no, Sir, we yesterday only, we
arranged it, all that."

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:55.488
He said: "All right, all right, doesn't
matter." You see, he couldn't understand,

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:57.685
you know, that this fellow who is trying
all these things

00:06:57.886 --> 00:07:00.902
and God is still saying that he has
to wait.

00:07:01.103 --> 00:07:04.559
And while this fellow is just singing songs
of God and all that,

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.874
and why is it so much impressed by this
another fellow

00:07:09.075 --> 00:07:14.312
who is doing nothing to seek God?

00:07:14.725 --> 00:07:17.754
So then God realized that he is in some
sort of an illusion.

00:07:17.955 --> 00:07:22.653
So He told him: "All right, you go and tell
them one thing.

00:07:22.854 --> 00:07:28.335
To both of them the same thing, that 'When
I went to God what I saw there

00:07:28.536 --> 00:07:36.803
was that He made a camel pass through
the eye of a needle.'"

00:07:38.503 --> 00:07:41.689
So he said: "Really, I should tell them?"

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.972
"Yes, yes, you just tell them, and see
the reaction."

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:49.342
So he went down. So this is, the first one
met him, he said: "What God has said?"

00:07:49.543 --> 00:07:53.250
He said that God has said: "Wait till
Sahaja Yoga comes in, then I'll meet you.

00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:55.872
Before that you go round like this."

00:07:56.073 --> 00:07:58.122
"Oh God, when will this Sahaja Yoga come?"

00:07:58.352 --> 00:08:00.716
And he said: "So, but He'll meet me
sometime?

00:08:00.917 --> 00:08:05.539
I hope Sahaja Yoga also comes some time."

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.489
And he was quite disappointed.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:13.221
So he went and he asked him that:
"What did you see with,

00:08:13.422 --> 00:08:16.779
there when you went to see God?"
He said: "I saw that, you know,

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:20.979
He passed a camel through the eye
of an, of a needle."

00:08:21.193 --> 00:08:25.014
He said: "What? How is it possible?
It's impossible!" -

00:08:25.245 --> 00:08:27.965
Now mental - "How is it possible,

00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:31.131
that a camel can pass through the eye,
it's not possible,

00:08:31.332 --> 00:08:36.586
see the volume of this one and such
a little thing. How can he pass?

00:08:36.787 --> 00:08:39.586
No, no, no, no you are just telling me
a story because you have been to God,

00:08:39.787 --> 00:08:43.814
you are trying to show off, that's all. I,
I don't believe in all this nonsense.

00:08:44.015 --> 00:08:47.511
You see, you are just telling me lies,
and don't try to befool me."

00:08:47.712 --> 00:08:52.325
So he went to another person who was
on the street eating nicely.

00:08:52.526 --> 00:08:55.309
He said: "How are you?" "Oh, I know He had
arranged before you reached there,

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.705
I know it was all right after all. You see,
He looks after me all the time.

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:05.409
So what did you see when you went there?"
He said: "I saw that God Almighty

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:12.397
passed a camel through an eye of a
needle. It's a very amazing thing."

00:09:12.598 --> 00:09:17.803
He said: "What amazing thing? He is God,
do you know He is God?

00:09:18.004 --> 00:09:24.888
Do you know He is God? God can do
anything. He can do anything!"

00:09:25.089 --> 00:09:33.448
That's made him understand, that if you
understand that God is all-powerful -

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:37.842
all-powerful, it doesn't mean that He can
move Himalayas to Maharashtra.

00:09:38.043 --> 00:09:41.160
It doesn't mean that!

00:09:50.536 --> 00:09:54.162
But it means He is all powerful.

00:09:54.363 --> 00:09:58.263
Means He can do subtlest and subtlest
thing, and such things

00:09:58.464 --> 00:10:03.626
which our brain, this mental side cannot
understand.

00:10:03.827 --> 00:10:09.714
It's beyond the conception of a human mind.

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:15.100
This is what God is.

00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:17.946
He is the One who has created human beings.

00:10:18.147 --> 00:10:20.170
He has to be beyond us if He is creating.

00:10:20.378 --> 00:10:23.626
If a potter creates a pot that means
he is beyond the pot.

00:10:23.827 --> 00:10:27.357
Pot cannot create God... the potter.

00:10:27.558 --> 00:10:33.053
And the potter has created the pot,
so that means that this pot

00:10:33.254 --> 00:10:38.193
which is created by him has to be -
something which is made by him,

00:10:38.394 --> 00:10:43.757
so he has to be much more powerful
than the pot is.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:52.877
But it is unbelievable, or say, beyond
the conception of human beings,

00:10:53.078 --> 00:11:02.824
that what a God it must be Who has made
this great computer.

00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:07.395
We take everything for granted.

00:11:07.596 --> 00:11:13.510
We cannot even make a particle of clay
ourself.

00:11:14.359 --> 00:11:17.230
We cannot make anything, human beings
cannot make.

00:11:17.431 --> 00:11:20.454
Ha, if there is some stone, all right, you
can put this up.

00:11:20.655 --> 00:11:25.428
If there is some clay, you can make some
sort of a house out of it.

00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:29.019
But it’s all dead from the dead.

00:11:31.836 --> 00:11:43.312
But can you make a candle which will
burn badhas?

00:11:47.538 --> 00:11:54.782
You have seen it with your own eyes that
before My photograph the badhas burn.

00:11:54.983 --> 00:11:58.049
Can you do that?

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:07.202
Now you, we have no, also the idea
of the complete, intricate working,

00:12:07.403 --> 00:12:18.695
delicate machinery, and also very dynamic
explosive machinery,

00:12:18.896 --> 00:12:24.370
how it works to create human beings,
to create all this universe,

00:12:24.571 --> 00:12:31.702
to create all these beautiful flowers and
trees and everything.

00:12:31.903 --> 00:12:36.671
Look at the stars. Look at how many
they are.

00:12:36.872 --> 00:12:41.849
Out of that He has chosen this Mother Earth
to create human beings.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:45.465
How He has made it?

00:12:47.627 --> 00:12:56.636
When He wants to send His own Son, He
can send it the way He wants to send it.

00:12:58.206 --> 00:13:10.271
Even to challenge this shows the mental
mind which is in, absolutely in mud.

00:13:14.005 --> 00:13:19.063
So to accept it is only possible

00:13:19.264 --> 00:13:23.221
when you have saints, real saints who
tell you,

00:13:23.422 --> 00:13:29.917
that this is how Shri Ganesha was born
out of Gauri.

00:13:34.206 --> 00:13:38.417
But to jump into it, into faith,

00:13:38.618 --> 00:13:44.741
when you come to Sahaja Yoga, you start
seeing miracles taking place.

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:50.119
Then you can understand that these miracles
are taking place

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:56.404
and if there is another miracle that has to
take place it will take place in any case.

00:13:56.605 --> 00:14:01.077
 We are not doing anything, it’s all done.

00:14:02.004 --> 00:14:08.247
And we don't doubt it. Once you doubt
you become again the same

00:14:10.339 --> 00:14:15.736
human being which is just embedded
in the mud.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.009
I always say that you are like lotuses now
opened out.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.914
You are not flying in the air. Your roots
are down there.

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:31.425
But you are now lotuses,

00:14:31.626 --> 00:14:38.836
and that's what is on top of the lotus,
this Mahalakshmi principle is born.

00:14:39.037 --> 00:14:45.543
Mahalakshmi principle is the One which
came on this earth

00:14:45.744 --> 00:14:56.842
as Sitaji, as Radha and also as Mary,
as Mother Mary.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:02.997
It's said that Mahalakshmi is born out
of the sea.

00:15:03.198 --> 00:15:09.969
What is the meaning of "Mary"? Maria means,
you know, Marine means "the sea".

00:15:11.714 --> 00:15:14.418
She was born out of the sea.

00:15:14.619 --> 00:15:21.282
So She being a Mahalakshmi Herself, She
could create a child. What's the harm?

00:15:23.845 --> 00:15:27.276
She could do anything,

00:15:29.756 --> 00:15:33.191
and this is the thing you have to rise
above.

00:15:33.392 --> 00:15:37.328
Christians have to rise above this
Christianity,

00:15:37.529 --> 00:15:41.522
and has to understand that it's such
a great thing that was Christ

00:15:41.723 --> 00:15:48.240
Who came on this earth, Who was the
Incarnation of the principle of Ganesha.

00:15:48.441 --> 00:15:51.365
Ganesha becoming Mahavishnu is
a very big thing

00:15:51.566 --> 00:15:54.642
which one should try to understand.

00:15:54.843 --> 00:16:01.719
Ganesha is the Son of Shiva.

00:16:02.576 --> 00:16:14.549
Shri Ganesha is the One Who was first
created before creating anything,

00:16:15.755 --> 00:16:22.610
any atmosphere, anything, because He is
the Omkara,

00:16:22.811 --> 00:16:28.843
and the Omkara is the first breaking
of Adi Shakti from Shiva.

00:16:29.044 --> 00:16:33.952
That sound, "Tan-kar", as they call it.
From there started Omkara

00:16:34.153 --> 00:16:39.205
and He is the One Who is the embodiment
of that Omkara.

00:16:39.406 --> 00:16:43.238
So this sound is Shri Ganesh, is His power,

00:16:43.439 --> 00:16:51.743
was created first foremost thing, just
to create holiness, pavitrata.

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:56.189
When this holiness was created, this
pavitrata was created,

00:16:56.390 --> 00:17:03.253
then everything was created in the sea
of that holiness.

00:17:04.777 --> 00:17:12.572
And then He incarnated as Christ, but
as Mahavishnu,

00:17:12.773 --> 00:17:18.271
not as Shiva's Son, but as Mahavishnu.

00:17:18.472 --> 00:17:26.191
And who is Vishnu? He is an uncle
of Shri Ganesh.

00:17:27.016 --> 00:17:34.151
His Mother's brother is Shri Vishnu.

00:17:35.286 --> 00:17:41.046
So the, it was brought up, we should say,
by Mahavishnu, we can say,

00:17:41.247 --> 00:17:47.893
but Mahalakshmi adopted the principle
of Shri Ganesh.

00:17:48.094 --> 00:17:51.194
In the Kundalini chart you can see that
the Shri Ganesha

00:17:51.395 --> 00:17:56.300
is connected on the left-hand side
to the Ida Nadi,

00:17:59.821 --> 00:18:03.748
and the Kundalini is above that.

00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:11.013
So now what has happened is this, that
He transcended that part,

00:18:11.214 --> 00:18:13.914
and if He had to come for the redemption,

00:18:14.115 --> 00:18:19.181
He had to come as the Son of Mahalakshmi.

00:18:19.382 --> 00:18:22.766
So it was Mahalakshmi who adopted Him,

00:18:22.967 --> 00:18:30.633
or we should say, really conceived Him
within Himself as Christ,

00:18:33.906 --> 00:18:36.445
and He became Mahavishnu.

00:18:36.646 --> 00:18:45.164
Anything is possible in the family of Gods
and Goddesses, because they are Gods.

00:18:47.177 --> 00:18:52.713
It is beyond human mind to understand
how these things

00:18:52.914 --> 00:18:59.547
are working out in that realm. Very
difficult.

00:19:00.102 --> 00:19:03.790
But now you have got Realization, you can
feel in the cool breeze,

00:19:03.991 --> 00:19:08.363
so many new things are happening to you.
So now believe Me,

00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:13.536
that there is no unholy alliances

00:19:13.737 --> 00:19:16.682
among the Gods and Goddesses, no
unholy alliances.

00:19:16.883 --> 00:19:21.643
There is nothing that is human in them.

00:19:21.844 --> 00:19:28.101
They are all divine, pure people.

00:19:30.212 --> 00:19:33.519
Once you understand this point, then
you will understand

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:43.858
why Shri Ganesha had to accept to be
a Son of Mahalakshmi,

00:19:44.059 --> 00:19:48.398
was born to Him as Christ.

00:19:48.599 --> 00:19:56.158
Because He had to come on Agnya,
and for the redemption,

00:19:56.359 --> 00:20:01.936
as Ganesha, He doesn't do the redemption
part,

00:20:02.137 --> 00:20:10.401
because at that stage He is for
the innocence, for the holiness,

00:20:10.602 --> 00:20:17.740
for the wisdom or also for destroying
a negativity.

00:20:17.949 --> 00:20:23.722
But He had to come up; only He,

00:20:23.923 --> 00:20:34.109
only Ganesha could be brought to this
very constricted chakra, Agnya chakra.

00:20:34.998 --> 00:20:38.046
Now why is it constricted? It's quite
a scientific thing

00:20:38.247 --> 00:20:40.898
which I would not like to discuss today.

00:20:41.099 --> 00:20:43.571
But it had to be constricted

00:20:43.772 --> 00:20:47.099
and it goes on getting more constricted,
this Agnya chakra,

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:54.615
the more, the more we think, the more
we go into the left or right,

00:20:54.816 --> 00:20:59.365
it goes on really becoming like this,
absolutely like this.

00:20:59.566 --> 00:21:07.443
So in this very subtle area only Christ
could be settled,

00:21:07.644 --> 00:21:11.782
because He is the subtlest of subtle.

00:21:13.471 --> 00:21:18.351
He's even subtler than an atom, because
in the atom

00:21:18.552 --> 00:21:23.134
those vibrations which move asymmetric
and symmetric movements

00:21:23.335 --> 00:21:28.218
are subtler than the atom.

00:21:28.419 --> 00:21:31.635
And this is the subtler of that also.

00:21:31.836 --> 00:21:36.886
So in that little very constricted area,

00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:46.706
only a personality like Christ, which is
nothing but purity.

00:21:46.907 --> 00:21:59.380
There is no other element in Him
but purity.

00:21:59.928 --> 00:22:08.598
All other Incarnations have all the five
elements in it.

00:22:08.799 --> 00:22:15.396
He has nothing. He is nothing but pure
vibrations.

00:22:15.597 --> 00:22:19.322
That's why He could walk on the water,

00:22:19.523 --> 00:22:27.525
because there was no mass in His body,
no matter in His body. No matter.

00:22:27.726 --> 00:22:33.051
No element, except for Chaitanya itself.

00:22:33.282 --> 00:22:38.643
Omkara becoming Ganesha in the mud,

00:22:38.844 --> 00:22:44.282
or the what you can say, the thing that
came out of Her body.

00:22:44.483 --> 00:22:49.080
Only the Chaitanya. So at Ganesha's stage
we can say

00:22:49.281 --> 00:22:53.971
that the Chaitanya was kept in that form,

00:22:54.172 --> 00:23:00.834
but in the state of Christ it was no
longer there.

00:23:04.082 --> 00:23:09.691
But the whole drama was played later on,
of His death and resurrection,

00:23:09.892 --> 00:23:13.942
because He is the One who is responsible
for our resurrection,

00:23:14.143 --> 00:23:19.482
because He is the Gate. He is the Path
because He is Shri Ganesh.

00:23:19.683 --> 00:23:25.885
Omkara is the Path, and He is the Gate,
but He is not the destination.

00:23:28.951 --> 00:23:32.542
His Mother is the destination.

00:23:34.852 --> 00:23:39.453
Even Mahalakshmi is not the Destination.
Even Mahakali, Mahasaraswati.

00:23:39.654 --> 00:23:45.143
It's the Adi Shakti is the destination
where you have to reach.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.283
All these things were never told
in the Bible

00:23:50.484 --> 00:23:56.059
because He could hardly live for four
years with public life.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:00.857
Nor did they want to tell about it because
they did not know.

00:24:01.058 --> 00:24:07.688
Also there was a definite suppression
of all Divine things,

00:24:07.889 --> 00:24:12.528
for these people are all commercialized
institutions,

00:24:12.729 --> 00:24:16.676
as we have also in India all kinds
of commercial institutions.

00:24:16.877 --> 00:24:22.308
But the only advantage in India is that
religion is not organized.

00:24:22.509 --> 00:24:25.127
Thank God for that!

00:24:25.328 --> 00:24:27.712
But they organized it, they organized
Christ,

00:24:27.913 --> 00:24:30.670
they organized all His principles,
everything,

00:24:30.871 --> 00:24:34.354
and now they think He was a good human
being.

00:24:34.555 --> 00:24:37.707
What a certificate to give!

00:24:39.948 --> 00:24:45.316
So today we are here to celebrate
the birth of Omkara.

00:24:45.517 --> 00:24:50.613
It's a very big thing. I don't know
if you can realize it, what it is,

00:24:50.814 --> 00:24:58.231
which moves into everything, whether it is
anu, paramanu, is the atom, molecules,

00:24:58.432 --> 00:25:05.702
into all the organizing of chemicals and
also the periodic laws,

00:25:05.903 --> 00:25:15.060
and also in the gravity, into everything
that moves is this Omkara,

00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:20.370
and your vibrations are nothing but
Omkaras.

00:25:21.505 --> 00:25:25.747
Actually, in My photograph the vibrations
have come as Omkaras.

00:25:25.948 --> 00:25:30.429
On the head of the people there is Omkara
written.

00:25:31.001 --> 00:25:35.919
How is it happening, these lights look
like Omkara?

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.477
How is it on top of the heads of the Sahaja
Yogis,

00:25:39.678 --> 00:25:43.496
there's - all the Sahaja Yogis' heads -
there is Omkara?

00:25:43.697 --> 00:25:52.579
Or Allah in Arabic language, My name
also, in Arabic?

00:25:54.346 --> 00:25:57.687
Who is doing this?

00:26:00.468 --> 00:26:04.279
It is He who is doing all those things.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:13.785
So Omkara itself takes a form to do things
to convince you of Adi Shakti.

00:26:13.986 --> 00:26:21.483
He is the One who is handling all these
powers.

00:26:23.296 --> 00:26:28.291
He doesn't enter into the photograph,
no, He does not,

00:26:28.492 --> 00:26:32.153
but He plays a trick.

00:26:34.811 --> 00:26:38.397
After all you see, if you go into details,
how do you get a photograph?

00:26:38.598 --> 00:26:43.972
Through the light. The light passes
straight, in a straight line.

00:26:44.173 --> 00:26:48.712
But if He wants, He can make the light
pass another way round.

00:26:48.913 --> 00:26:52.472
He can just transform the light into
something else.

00:26:52.673 --> 00:26:55.763
He can do whatever He likes.

00:26:55.964 --> 00:27:00.140
And that's what He does to convince you.

00:27:00.341 --> 00:27:03.549
And He said that "Anything against Me
I'll tolerate,

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.310
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

00:27:07.511 --> 00:27:11.869
And this Holy Ghost is the Adi Shakti.

00:27:13.408 --> 00:27:20.654
Without Him you cannot go to the Sahasrara.

00:27:20.855 --> 00:27:24.102
So the in the whole play He is like
the sutra dhara,

00:27:24.303 --> 00:27:28.100
He is the One who is the conductor,

00:27:28.301 --> 00:27:34.868
the One moves the strings in a puppet show.

00:27:35.069 --> 00:27:37.930
And so it is very important to pray
to Shri Ganesha,

00:27:38.131 --> 00:27:40.987
every time we have Puja, we have
to pray to Him

00:27:41.188 --> 00:27:47.685
and we, that's how we are praying to Lord
Jesus Christ. Every time.

00:27:47.886 --> 00:27:53.249
Without His auspiciousness, without His
help, we cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:53.450 --> 00:28:00.008
He is the Manager. See, I am sitting
here and He is the manager.

00:28:00.209 --> 00:28:04.140
Supposing there is no management, how
will I speak here?

00:28:04.341 --> 00:28:07.569
Nothing can happen. But He is so efficient,

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:12.720
and you never see Him working out
everything, doing everything.

00:28:13.824 --> 00:28:18.096
You all would not have understood everything I said in English.

00:28:19.201 --> 00:28:21.837
And today is Jesus Christ’s birthday.

00:28:22.853 --> 00:28:28.399
Jesus Christ, what a great personality He is, that’s what I was telling them.

00:28:28.645 --> 00:28:34.303
We people pray to Shri Ganesha, worship Him, because others told us to do so.

00:28:35.082 --> 00:28:38.134
But what is He? What is Shri Ganesha?

00:28:38.335 --> 00:28:41.540
We say that He is Omkara. What is Omkara?

00:28:43.717 --> 00:28:48.501
All the functions of this whole universe, takes place due to the power of this Omkara,

00:28:48.702 --> 00:28:52.366
which we call as “chaitanya”, call as “Bramha chaitanya”.

00:28:52.766 --> 00:28:57.456
The concrete form of Brahma chaitanya is Omkara,

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.582
and the idol form of that,

00:28:59.783 --> 00:29:02.862
or the iconic form of that, is Shri Ganesha.

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.540
And the incarnation of that (Brahma chaiytnya)

00:29:07.792 --> 00:29:09.072
is Jesus Christ.

00:29:11.673 --> 00:29:13.407
If you understand this point,

00:29:13.608 --> 00:29:18.052
so, when we worship Shri Ganesha, like mad people we keep singing.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.357
In each and every word of what we are saying,

00:29:23.778 --> 00:29:26.511
We are describing His powers.

00:29:27.495 --> 00:29:28.639
Why are we doing this?

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:33.295
Whoever has powers, supposing I have some powers, and you have some powers,

00:29:33.496 --> 00:29:36.051
then what is the need to describe them?

00:29:36.807 --> 00:29:39.495
So that we also achieve those powers,

00:29:39.884 --> 00:29:42.702
and with those powers we also become powerful,

00:29:42.903 --> 00:29:45.170
That is why we worship Shri Ganesha.

00:29:45.768 --> 00:29:48.568
The greatest of his powers is sacredness.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.191
Anything that is sacred is most powerful..

00:29:52.599 --> 00:29:54.361
Nobody can touch it.

00:29:54.766 --> 00:29:57.710
For example take a soap.
You wash it as many times you want

00:29:57.911 --> 00:30:00.500
or wash it with anything, it doesn’t get dirty.

00:30:01.957 --> 00:30:04.432
At times soap also may get dirty,

00:30:04.782 --> 00:30:07.689
but this Omkar is holy, clean,

00:30:09.086 --> 00:30:13.322
and eternal being,

00:30:13.616 --> 00:30:18.560
or it is a power, which can work endlessly.

00:30:19.283 --> 00:30:24.115
When you worship this power, you should remember,

00:30:24.316 --> 00:30:28.178
that, we want to absorb this power within us,

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:32.477
so that, we become pure from within and all our chakras get cleared.

00:30:32.678 --> 00:30:34.639
Our lives become pure and our society,

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:41.744
our political field, our country, and the whole world get purified.

00:30:42.784 --> 00:30:44.784
And in that purity lies the joy.

00:30:45.088 --> 00:30:47.010
When something becomes very clean,

00:30:47.211 --> 00:30:50.323
for example when you have a bath and you wear a clean dress,

00:30:50.524 --> 00:30:51.940
then you feel very nice.

00:30:52.141 --> 00:30:54.801
But, when your whole life,

00:30:55.936 --> 00:30:58.192
gets purified by this Omkar,

00:30:58.819 --> 00:30:59.771
then

00:31:01.152 --> 00:31:05.323
 we call it as “Atmanand”, (joy of spirit) we get that, achieve that.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.240
And in the atma (spirit) also,

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.647
the prevailing power is that of “Omkara” only.

00:31:15.171 --> 00:31:18.302
But we do not understand what Omkara is.

00:31:19.485 --> 00:31:23.773
We just say it is something like “ardha matra” (half a syllable).

00:31:24.391 --> 00:31:28.040
By saying this we don’t understand what exactly it is.

00:31:29.842 --> 00:31:35.480
And when this four powers,”chatvari”, which is Ganesha’s powers,

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:42.288
We see the advent of the same in the life of Jesus Christ

00:31:43.185 --> 00:31:45.983
But He was alive only for four years.

00:31:46.356 --> 00:31:53.888
And somehow, about Him, there has been very less knowledge.

00:31:54.189 --> 00:31:57.823
But in western countries, people started following Him.

00:31:58.101 --> 00:32:01.760
Now these people have only brain and nothing else.

00:32:02.109 --> 00:32:04.799
They have no heart but have only brain.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.655
So in that brain,

00:32:08.718 --> 00:32:12.000
how can such a subtle thing enter?

00:32:15.008 --> 00:32:17.559
To understand this subtle thing

00:32:18.146 --> 00:32:20.816
in the mind of human being,

00:32:22.356 --> 00:32:24.609
the intellect should awaken, meaning,

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:29.007
within him that sensitive power should generate,

00:32:29.208 --> 00:32:38.145
by which he gets filled, with luminary.

00:32:38.455 --> 00:32:40.173
Gets flooded with light.

00:32:40.374 --> 00:32:42.896
In that light, You can see that,

00:32:43.097 --> 00:32:47.300
when this light is falling on the eyes, how dazzling it is.

00:32:47.704 --> 00:32:50.343
But the light that comes from within,

00:32:50.581 --> 00:32:54.391
doesn’t blur your eyes, but in that light everything is visible.

00:32:55.502 --> 00:32:58.600
To achieve that enlightenment of the spirit,

00:32:59.695 --> 00:33:02.910
You see the agnya chakra, this chakra is exactly above the “Medha” (brain).

00:33:03.111 --> 00:33:04.334
This is Medha,

00:33:04.612 --> 00:33:07.880
which is known as brain plate, agnya chakra is on this.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.760
When Medha opens,

00:33:11.801 --> 00:33:14.863
meaning Medha is like this “closed”.

00:33:15.276 --> 00:33:17.976
When it opens, that is when we say agnya chakra has opened.

00:33:18.177 --> 00:33:21.407
And when kundalini comes up from inside this,

00:33:22.463 --> 00:33:25.663
and when it covers the upper part of Medha,

00:33:26.306 --> 00:33:28.980
then in the intellect of human being

00:33:30.916 --> 00:33:32.436
a distinct quality,

00:33:33.696 --> 00:33:35.876
which is beyond human being,

00:33:36.077 --> 00:33:38.532
beyond the intelligence of human,

00:33:38.992 --> 00:33:45.470
a distinctive divine power, gets awakened.

00:33:45.976 --> 00:33:48.079
And with this divine power

00:33:48.493 --> 00:33:53.479
you start understanding what is truth and what is untruth.

00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:57.387
You feel the same power in your hands also.

00:33:57.706 --> 00:34:00.875
Gradually, you don’t even have to check your hands for anything,

00:34:01.076 --> 00:34:03.216
you will know it just like that.

00:34:03.465 --> 00:34:06.347
You will at once understand this is wrong, this is right.

00:34:06.548 --> 00:34:10.334
But some people start understanding this very soon,

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:14.701
I say that such people have been blessed by Jesus Christ.

00:34:15.084 --> 00:34:18.431
And some people get stuck in the vortex of mind

00:34:18.632 --> 00:34:21.849
For example, unnecessarily getting trapped in religion,

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:23.507
Getting stuck in caste and creed,

00:34:23.708 --> 00:34:28.056
and thinking that “I like Indians only” or “I like English only”.

00:34:28.257 --> 00:34:32.459
These kind of thoughts, and narrow mindedness and also conservatism,

00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:37.337
And miserliness and such things around the world, In our country (India),

00:34:37.577 --> 00:34:40.803
many kind of parasites, mosquitoes, bugs are available (who live on other’s money)

00:34:41.004 --> 00:34:43.110
Which are not available anywhere else.

00:34:43.311 --> 00:34:47.505
Whatever is available here, is not available anywhere else.

00:34:48.084 --> 00:34:51.987
A human, how far and how deep, can fall into a pit,

00:34:52.188 --> 00:34:55.198
is seen only in this country. Sometimes it is very surprising,

00:34:55.399 --> 00:34:58.176
that in the country where great incarnations took birth,

00:34:58.688 --> 00:35:01.212
the culture of which is full of devotion,

00:35:01.475 --> 00:35:07.222
where Lord is worshipped, in such a place, by this kind of filth,

00:35:08.052 --> 00:35:11.048
and this kind of conservative attitude,

00:35:11.346 --> 00:35:15.051
we are decaying ourselves and continuing do so.

00:35:15.398 --> 00:35:18.095
At least after coming to Sahaja Yoga we should leave them.

00:35:18.296 --> 00:35:22.021
But even now this caste creed, this, that, and every other thing

00:35:22.222 --> 00:35:25.200
is still making us like a vermin.

00:35:26.129 --> 00:35:30.120
So this “Vishwa Nirmal Dharma”, this religion

00:35:31.051 --> 00:35:33.977
is that of “Omkara”,
is that of holiness.

00:35:34.178 --> 00:35:37.079
In this religion if all these attitude is going to be with you,

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:41.071
then you can not get into this religion,
And externally whatever you may say,

00:35:41.272 --> 00:35:46.280
that “we worship Mataji, we use Her photo, and we follow Her,

00:35:49.274 --> 00:35:52.776
So by that neither you are going to gain anything,

00:35:53.467 --> 00:35:56.218
nor the world is going to benefit anything.

00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.210
It is something like a lamp says

00:35:58.411 --> 00:36:01.807
” yes sir, I have light, so I am giving light to everyone”.

00:36:02.008 --> 00:36:05.223
then others will say ” show, where is your light”?

00:36:05.954 --> 00:36:08.520
We are deceiving ourselves.

00:36:09.147 --> 00:36:12.799
So whoever is in Sahaja Yoga, first they should completely convince themselves,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.521
that now we are not going to deceive ourselves.

00:36:15.722 --> 00:36:19.920
“We are going to leave this completely and get deeper into Sahaja Yoga”.

00:36:20.658 --> 00:36:22.938
Only then you will benefit out of this.

00:36:23.176 --> 00:36:27.803
Now I have noticed what happens to this, half baked people.

00:36:29.928 --> 00:36:35.465
It is possible that because of going to some Guru you may have problems.

00:36:36.092 --> 00:36:40.115
Or because of the wrong company also you may have problems.

00:36:40.316 --> 00:36:47.399
Because today we are in that Era, which we call as kruti Yuga,

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:51.920
where in this brahma chaitanya (vibrations) will become active. This will work.

00:36:52.555 --> 00:36:53.887
Now you,

00:36:54.991 --> 00:36:59.113
can neither deceive yourself nor you can cheat Me.

00:36:59.835 --> 00:37:04.418
Whoever adopts the path of deception, will bear the consequences.

00:37:07.704 --> 00:37:09.376
One gentleman came and told Me

00:37:09.577 --> 00:37:12.845
“mother, when I am meditating my face becomes this big”.

00:37:13.046 --> 00:37:14.555
I said ” is that so”?

00:37:15.818 --> 00:37:18.635
“how does it look like”?
“Like Hanumana” he said.

00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.395
I said good, “you have become Hanumana”.

00:37:21.596 --> 00:37:23.596
He said “no mother, I feel agitated, that my face is going to burst”

00:37:23.781 --> 00:37:25.693
“You chew tobacco, right”?

00:37:25.963 --> 00:37:27.384
“Yes, That is right”.

00:37:27.721 --> 00:37:30.486
I said, ”if chew tobacco, why do you meditate”?

00:37:32.145 --> 00:37:34.614
“You want to chew tobacco and meditate as well”?

00:37:34.815 --> 00:37:37.080
Then the face will obviously bloat.

00:37:39.723 --> 00:37:44.911
Another gentleman came, and said ”look Mother, my this finger is cut”.

00:37:45.789 --> 00:37:47.574
“alright, were you smoking”?

00:37:47.775 --> 00:37:50.467
he said “Yes”.
“so this finger of mine hurt”.

00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:53.825
 gentleman met with a car accident.

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:57.086
He came and told that “Mother, only this finger is gone”.

00:37:57.287 --> 00:37:59.731
“only this is hurt (index finger) because I smoke”.

00:37:59.986 --> 00:38:04.215
You come to Sahaja Yoga and still smoke and consume liquor.

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:06.430
And you do all other things,

00:38:06.661 --> 00:38:09.964
you claim to be a Sahaja Yogi,
roaming around with a big badge.

00:38:10.165 --> 00:38:15.160
The same badge which you are wearing,
is going to break your head, let me warn you.

00:38:15.755 --> 00:38:19.390
If you think that it is a simple thing to wear a badge, then it is not so.

00:38:19.585 --> 00:38:21.136
The badge which you are wearing

00:38:21.337 --> 00:38:25.391
 will break your head,
which I don’t want, I am not going to break.

00:38:25.677 --> 00:38:29.440
Do you understand that this badge is not an ordinary thing.

00:38:29.884 --> 00:38:34.050
It has a coefficient.
Meaning, vibrations flow out of it.

00:38:34.805 --> 00:38:37.557
The same vibrations, if encircles your throat and strangles you,

00:38:37.758 --> 00:38:40.007
then you will say, “Mother, I was sleeping with the badge on,

00:38:40.208 --> 00:38:42.265
then how did this happen to me?

00:38:42.669 --> 00:38:46.156
The badge you were wearing, came out and broke your scull.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.503
So don’t put on the badge.

00:38:47.704 --> 00:38:50.955
But if you want to use it, then be worthy of it.

00:38:52.776 --> 00:38:56.252
Now-a-days everyone says ”Mother, give one badge,

00:38:56.453 --> 00:38:58.791
we want to put it around the neck as locket.

00:38:58.992 --> 00:39:01.494
You wear it but with caution, do you get it?

00:39:01.695 --> 00:39:05.807
Don’t blame me later that,”

00:39:06.054 --> 00:39:10.480
Mother, I wore this and went,
still I slipped and my leg broke“.

00:39:10.956 --> 00:39:13.726
That badge only made you slip, so don’t wear it.

00:39:14.052 --> 00:39:15.159
If you want to wear it,

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:19.145
then you should have the eligibility and worthiness for it.

00:39:19.749 --> 00:39:22.230
If you are not eligible to wear this,

00:39:22.431 --> 00:39:25.440
then God save you from Jesus Christ.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.439
And Shri Ganesha is one step above Him.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.968
He has the axe (parasu) in His left hand,

00:39:31.169 --> 00:39:33.212
If He hits, then what can I do?

00:39:33.412 --> 00:39:37.476
As for He is concerned He doesn’t listen to me, ow that you have worn it,

00:39:37.677 --> 00:39:40.664
then He says
“now wear and face the consequence”.

00:39:41.481 --> 00:39:43.483
So to wear this badge

00:39:43.983 --> 00:39:44.983
or, to

00:39:46.142 --> 00:39:48.509
wear the pendent, to wear the ring,

00:39:48.709 --> 00:39:51.720
Oh my God! you have to be very careful.

00:39:51.998 --> 00:39:55.093
When you go to washroom, remove them

00:39:55.593 --> 00:39:57.113
and keep carefully.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:02.080
About My hairs also I have told people to oblige.

00:40:02.413 --> 00:40:05.920
These hairs have been given by “Yama” (God of death).

00:40:06.269 --> 00:40:07.870
He is always behind them.

00:40:08.071 --> 00:40:10.717
So, please, if you see them lying anywhere,

00:40:10.918 --> 00:40:13.035
be kind enough to return them to Me.

00:40:13.236 --> 00:40:17.150
I don’t want you to face any problem, because I am a mother also.

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:20.826
But these people (deities) are not your mother or father.

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:23.352
They are your brothers.

00:40:26.502 --> 00:40:28.762
They go behind you with a stick.

00:40:29.334 --> 00:40:32.400
So understand that you have come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:33.083 --> 00:40:36.200
“Oh! it is so joy giving with bhajan and all”

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.436
Then how did you get the blow?

00:40:41.912 --> 00:40:43.175
So that’s why,

00:40:43.596 --> 00:40:46.462
the specialty of Sahaja Yoga should be understood

00:40:46.835 --> 00:40:49.149
thus that this is the knowledge of the supreme God.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:52.848
The supreme God
is not a Mother.

00:40:55.743 --> 00:40:57.389
Mother is all affectionate.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:40:59.854
She understands that these are my children,

00:41:00.055 --> 00:41:02.955
at times they do this and do that, it’s alright.

00:41:04.484 --> 00:41:05.520
But,

00:41:07.007 --> 00:41:09.098
The supreme God is watching,

00:41:11.072 --> 00:41:13.072
how you all are behaving?

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:20.471
After a lot of hard work, We,
that is your Mother gave you all Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:22.227 --> 00:41:25.161
And where is your foot wobbling?

00:41:26.693 --> 00:41:29.190
What mistake are you doing now?

00:41:30.592 --> 00:41:33.600
And so you should act with understanding.

00:41:35.306 --> 00:41:39.639
But, I would say that, Adishakti is definitely
the power of the God almighty,

00:41:40.583 --> 00:41:42.054
She is His desire.

00:41:42.682 --> 00:41:45.402
But, The God almighty, is watching,

00:41:46.143 --> 00:41:48.610
that all the hard work that is happening,

00:41:48.811 --> 00:41:51.181
and in the drama created by Her,

00:41:51.382 --> 00:41:54.156
how many are truthful and untruthful.

00:41:54.548 --> 00:41:58.238
And He is calculating, who all should be taken to task.

00:41:58.786 --> 00:42:02.046
Whoever is good, also should be
considered sometimes, right?

00:42:02.247 --> 00:42:03.524
It’s not like that.

00:42:04.064 --> 00:42:07.576
But whoever is insincere,
He will catch them.

00:42:08.165 --> 00:42:09.862
And He will give everybody a blow.

00:42:10.073 --> 00:42:11.673
That is why, kindly,

00:42:12.136 --> 00:42:14.303
do whatever you have to,

00:42:14.695 --> 00:42:18.279
with a clean heart,
with a open heart.

00:42:18.486 --> 00:42:21.587
I have not told you before that if you have other interests within,

00:42:21.788 --> 00:42:24.849
if you have blind faith, if you have casteism within you,

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:28.447
Or if you have “we Indians are great” kind of feeling within you,

00:42:28.648 --> 00:42:31.403
These kind of feelings are myth, it has no purity,

00:42:31.652 --> 00:42:35.461
You kindly get rid of all these feelings, and then wear my pendent.

00:42:35.662 --> 00:42:39.084
Because with each pendent one “Gana” is appointed.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.382
And they (ganas) are around you.

00:42:42.668 --> 00:42:44.496
They always protect you,

00:42:44.697 --> 00:42:49.199
in a way they protect you to stop you from doing wrong things.

00:42:53.557 --> 00:42:56.217
Because, they know you in and out.

00:42:56.988 --> 00:43:02.335
So, today this warning also was very essential for you all.

00:43:03.426 --> 00:43:06.080
And also, it is a very happy occasion

00:43:06.358 --> 00:43:11.993
that if, In this world, Jesus Christ had not come,

00:43:12.588 --> 00:43:16.101
and if he had not made us sit on his Agnya Chakra,

00:43:16.727 --> 00:43:20.133
and opened the path of rebirth,

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.052
path of resurrection, then Sahaja Yoga wouldn’t have been possible.

00:43:25.352 --> 00:43:27.460
 It was very essential that He took birth.

00:43:27.661 --> 00:43:30.781
But there is no fight among themselves.
All of them (incarnations) are,

00:43:30.982 --> 00:43:33.310
born on one single tree,

00:43:33.511 --> 00:43:36.286
on a living tree they all were created

00:43:36.487 --> 00:43:39.384
and this tree was flourished finally I came on Sahasrara,

00:43:39.585 --> 00:43:42.960
and this work (Sahaja Yoga) happened in Sahasrara.

00:43:44.547 --> 00:43:47.468
If tree is not there, how can Sahasrara be there?

00:43:48.206 --> 00:43:52.508
And if the Sahasrara is there, then this tree only has created that Sahasrara.

00:43:52.709 --> 00:43:57.394
 So, it is the responsibility of the tree also to take care of the Sahasrara,

00:43:58.354 --> 00:44:03.575
and protect it completely, and punish those who go against it (Sahasrara).

00:44:07.018 --> 00:44:10.800
So, for all of you, today is in a very special sense,

00:44:11.205 --> 00:44:14.613
is of importance, that if Jesus Christ had not come,

00:44:14.814 --> 00:44:17.750
then, our resurrection wouldn’t have happened.

00:44:17.951 --> 00:44:22.782
Because, we tell Shri Ganesha that when our time for moksha comes,

00:44:22.983 --> 00:44:24.760
you please protect us.

00:44:25.193 --> 00:44:26.463
(inaudible)

00:44:27.964 --> 00:44:32.873
At the time of moksha He Himself (Ganesh) appears,

00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:36.481
on the agnya chakra and gives you protection.

00:44:38.981 --> 00:44:42.840
So Today’s day is very auspicious for all of us,

00:44:43.237 --> 00:44:46.440
very joy giving day also,

00:44:46.655 --> 00:44:50.573
and at the same time cautions us also, that “Be careful”.

00:44:51.017 --> 00:44:53.789
And if you get stuck in “agnya chakra”,

00:44:54.218 --> 00:44:56.823
then you will end up either in a mental asylum,

00:45:00.742 --> 00:45:03.038
or you will get some other disease.

00:45:03.239 --> 00:45:07.896
The sanctity of agnya chakra should be maintained, meaning our thoughts should be pure.

00:45:08.097 --> 00:45:12.555
If impure thoughts come, then we should keep forgiving them.

00:45:13.073 --> 00:45:14.998
Thoughts should always be pure.

00:45:15.199 --> 00:45:19.359
And as you start ascending, you will not get impure thoughts,

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.560
only pure thoughts will come.

00:45:22.255 --> 00:45:27.360
This Sahaja Yoga is made only for your joy,

00:45:27.701 --> 00:45:30.495
for your greatness,

00:45:30.696 --> 00:45:32.391
for your dignity,

00:45:32.645 --> 00:45:36.577
and for your over all progress.

00:45:37.323 --> 00:45:41.721
But along with that this fact also is contained,

00:45:44.255 --> 00:45:46.704
that for this great work,

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:51.518
and for the people who are completely attached with this work,

00:45:51.915 --> 00:45:56.663
if one does not co-operate and provide their full support,

00:45:57.172 --> 00:45:59.929
also may land up into deep trouble.

00:46:01.282 --> 00:46:04.006
Those who are doing this work wholeheartedly,

00:46:04.207 --> 00:46:07.262
you should support them wholeheartedly.

00:46:07.463 --> 00:46:11.129
In many people now I am noticing the disease of miserliness.

00:46:11.330 --> 00:46:12.513
For example,

00:46:13.974 --> 00:46:19.097
“if 4 rupees can be saved, it is okay, let me save it”.

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:24.263
If you try to save 4 rupees, you will lose at least 400 rupees,

00:46:24.464 --> 00:46:25.718
just like that.

00:46:27.713 --> 00:46:31.576
And your 1 rupee given to Sahaja Yoga, can be equal to 1 lac rupees.

00:46:31.777 --> 00:46:34.918
Meaning, one rupee will be enough, that’s what I am telling you.

00:46:35.347 --> 00:46:38.247
But we are not giving anything, everything belongs to Mother,

00:46:38.448 --> 00:46:40.159
we are giving Mother, what is Hers.

00:46:40.363 --> 00:46:43.453
And, I don’t take anything, you know that I am trying to resist every day

00:46:43.654 --> 00:46:45.128
 that don’t give me presents,

00:46:45.329 --> 00:46:47.750
I don’t want anything, don’t give Me sarees,

00:46:47.951 --> 00:46:50.622
From morning to evening, since 5 years the tussle is going on,

00:46:50.823 --> 00:46:53.852
no one listens, I have been asking them to reduce buying gifts,

00:46:54.053 --> 00:46:57.606
Now the prices also are increasing, and I don’t need anything.

00:46:58.096 --> 00:47:01.246
But for Sahaja Yoga money is required.

00:47:01.928 --> 00:47:06.818
But there are people here, who feel that eat food for free is right.

00:47:10.159 --> 00:47:14.285
Later if they have stomach problem, I am not responsible for that.

00:47:19.027 --> 00:47:21.960
And this place is not for beggars.

00:47:22.547 --> 00:47:25.660
This is for people who are wealthy by demeanor.

00:47:25.954 --> 00:47:28.201
If you have the mentality of a king, then come here.

00:47:28.402 --> 00:47:30.799
There is no need that you should have money.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.466
Many rich people are extremely stingy,

00:47:33.667 --> 00:47:36.678
and so peculiar that it is difficult to understand them,

00:47:36.879 --> 00:47:39.095
And many poor people are like Me,

00:47:39.296 --> 00:47:42.454
that they find joy in just giving to others.

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:45.836
When your one hand opens you take from it.

00:47:46.037 --> 00:47:48.570
But only when the other hand opens, you will get from that hand,

00:47:48.771 --> 00:47:50.636
otherwise it will stop there.

00:47:51.745 --> 00:47:56.166
But when I hear about miserliness, I feel very disgusted you cannot imagine.

00:47:58.675 --> 00:48:02.742
But, I liked the other day’s scene, when there was nothing to give,

00:48:02.943 --> 00:48:05.550
people accepted my photo with affection.

00:48:05.751 --> 00:48:09.440
“Mother, please give us your photo this time, we will feel good”.

00:48:09.726 --> 00:48:11.040
Satisfaction,

00:48:13.088 --> 00:48:14.606
should come first.

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:19.680
After the satisfaction human being, nobody can sacrifice like Jesus Christ, right?

00:48:20.046 --> 00:48:23.760
But, that sacrifice should be gladly accepted.

00:48:24.141 --> 00:48:26.771
It can be difficult, but it doesn’t matter.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:29.327
But we all doing a very great job.

00:48:29.528 --> 00:48:32.920
And not just for us, we are doing it for all others.

00:48:35.825 --> 00:48:37.746
Next year I am going to get your name list.

00:48:37.947 --> 00:48:41.006
and I want to see, specially, about the complain on Bombay people,

00:48:41.207 --> 00:48:44.320
that, they completely refuse to pay money.

00:48:44.890 --> 00:48:48.050
And the Mahalakshmi temple is in this Bombay.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.586
What is the use of that poor Mahalakshmi and the temple?

00:48:51.787 --> 00:48:54.355
Where Mahalakshmi Herself came out of the earth,

00:48:54.556 --> 00:48:59.345
and in such a place people are so stingy that, they do not want to pay at all,

00:48:59.647 --> 00:49:04.508
thinking that Mother is doing everything, so come, let us just relax and enjoy.

00:49:05.452 --> 00:49:08.480
As such everything will happen whether they pay or not,

00:49:08.774 --> 00:49:11.303
But what will happen to them,

00:49:11.835 --> 00:49:13.200
think of that.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:21.349
The quality of Mahalakshmi principle is that, when we become a contented personality,

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:25.819
when the Lakshmi principle attains maturity, the Mahalakshmi principle gets awakened,

00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:28.362
and we start searching the truth.

00:49:30.024 --> 00:49:32.320
If there is no contentment within you,

00:49:32.995 --> 00:49:35.560
you cannot attain the Mahalakshmi principle

00:49:37.774 --> 00:49:42.158
Look at Seeta Ji’s life, how long did she stay with Ramchandra Ji?

00:49:42.355 --> 00:49:43.837
Radha Ji’s life,

00:49:44.037 --> 00:49:47.896
And after that Shri Jesus Christ’s Mother’s life?

00:49:48.367 --> 00:49:52.280
In all the three lives there is plenty of sacrifice.

00:49:52.534 --> 00:49:55.764
In all the three lives there is plenty of sacrifice.

00:49:55.971 --> 00:49:59.236
So with the Mahalakshmi principle human becomes contented,

00:49:59.477 --> 00:50:00.477
and

00:50:01.778 --> 00:50:05.377
with this principle he seeks the truth,

00:50:06.005 --> 00:50:09.600
And during this seeking, he leaves behind the untruth.

00:50:10.513 --> 00:50:13.382
In today’s Mahalakshmi Puja,

00:50:13.583 --> 00:50:18.904
Where in we are worshipping Jesus Christ, and His mother Mary

00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:22.000
then we should get into total contentment.

00:50:24.939 --> 00:50:29.800
When we get satisfied with materialistic things and worldly things,

00:50:30.475 --> 00:50:34.046
only then the Mahalakshmi principle awakens within us.

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:40.440
And then, the Mahalakshmi Principle manages the Lakshmi principle.

00:50:41.774 --> 00:50:45.400
And Lakshmi Principle starts manifesting by itself,

00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:50.080
gets implemented by itself and gives the benefit automatically.

00:50:50.397 --> 00:50:53.680
Automatically everything constructive happens.

00:51:02.416 --> 00:51:06.368
So, I just have to tell you that expand your heart.

00:51:07.075 --> 00:51:08.440
Be generous.

00:51:08.702 --> 00:51:11.960
And establish that Omkara within your heart,

00:51:12.254 --> 00:51:16.470
establish that essence of the spirit, establish that Jesus Christ and the Ganesha within you,

00:51:16.772 --> 00:51:18.397
because of whom,

00:51:22.016 --> 00:51:24.551
all our undone work will be done,

00:51:25.036 --> 00:51:27.560
and you can have authority over me.

00:51:28.139 --> 00:51:32.535
Without them I can not give you any right.

00:51:33.822 --> 00:51:38.800
In the raising of Kundalini also, until, from the mooladhar

00:51:41.435 --> 00:51:48.096
 the permission doesn’t come, unless the Ganesha, present in mooladhar says: ” Yes”,

00:51:49.128 --> 00:51:52.526
 not only Me, but no one can raise the Kundalini.

00:51:53.994 --> 00:51:56.760
These are His reserved rights.

00:51:58.355 --> 00:52:01.269
If anybody thinks that He is very close to mother,

00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:04.493
then they should understand that even if He is close,

00:52:04.694 --> 00:52:11.191
and in real He is close to mother then that is happening with Shri Ganesha’s consent,

00:52:11.477 --> 00:52:13.397
Jesus Christ’s consent.

00:52:14.668 --> 00:52:18.280
Without their consent, I can not accept anyone.

00:52:18.610 --> 00:52:20.610
This is a bondage upon us,

00:52:21.166 --> 00:52:25.200
that’s why I tell you again and again that “be careful”.

00:52:25.898 --> 00:52:28.200
Their bondage has to be accepted.

00:52:28.462 --> 00:52:33.840
And whatever is their opinion about you,

00:52:34.237 --> 00:52:36.440
whatever they think about you,

00:52:36.702 --> 00:52:39.040
I have to take into consideration.

00:52:39.484 --> 00:52:43.501
How ever hard I may forgive, from a mother’s point of view whatever I may say,

00:52:43.702 --> 00:52:45.867
But I am lost in front of these deities (Jesus and Ganesha).

00:52:46.068 --> 00:52:51.880
And You should know that, “They” are there to help you, to cleanse you,

00:52:52.237 --> 00:52:54.013
and do everything for you,

00:52:54.214 --> 00:52:57.942
But “They” have one expectation from you, I have no expectations, I am without expectations,

00:52:58.143 --> 00:53:01.351
I don’t want anything from you, however you are it is fine.

00:53:01.552 --> 00:53:07.522
But, “They” have expectations that, if you say or do anything against Me,

00:53:08.035 --> 00:53:11.282
or if you do any kind of “pettiness” in Sahaja Yoga,

00:53:11.483 --> 00:53:15.999
or you do any kind of cheating or any such thing, then “They” will be behind you.

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.294
  That’s why I am telling you again and again, on this day,

00:53:18.495 --> 00:53:20.774
on this auspicious occasion, we should realize,

00:53:20.975 --> 00:53:24.037
 that, such great powers are standing by our side.

00:53:24.238 --> 00:53:28.640
And why shouldn’t we accept these powers and live like an emperor?

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:32.687
And why should we be “Petty minded”, when we have such a big throne,

00:53:32.888 --> 00:53:35.179
then let us sit on the throne with dignity.

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:38.486
And let us live with that dignity, as we are supposed to.

00:53:38.687 --> 00:53:41.437
Now you all are Sahaja Yogis, you are saints,

00:53:41.638 --> 00:53:44.206
it is a very great thing, when were there so many Yogis?

00:53:44.407 --> 00:53:47.800
And so many saints have come to “Ganapatipule”,

00:53:48.086 --> 00:53:51.294
where in Maha Ganesha is sitting, He is called Maha Ganesha.

00:53:51.495 --> 00:53:53.198
And in the Maha Ganesha’s

00:53:57.104 --> 00:53:59.143
family, we all have joined.

00:53:59.493 --> 00:54:01.960
We have come to His forum.

00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:08.462
And with His blessings, within us also, great powers as He has, can manifest.

00:54:08.663 --> 00:54:13.400
But first of all, to withstand that power, His purity should be established.

00:54:14.059 --> 00:54:16.541
and there should be a devotion (bhakti) towards him.

00:54:16.742 --> 00:54:22.441
The bhakti should be in such a way that, there is no selfishness of any kind in that.

00:54:22.688 --> 00:54:24.275
There is only Bhakti.

00:54:24.553 --> 00:54:28.202
If we can ready ourselves like Him, then He takes care of rest of the things.

00:54:28.403 --> 00:54:30.590
Then He is at your disposal to manage you.

00:54:30.791 --> 00:54:35.920
But if you go on the opposite side, He may also harm you.

00:54:36.587 --> 00:54:38.031
just like that,

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:43.070
I want to make you understand something sensible.

00:54:43.271 --> 00:54:49.760
Because a mother always feels that, these children of mine are very sweet,

00:54:50.196 --> 00:54:53.360
and you should only benefit from them (deities).

00:54:53.884 --> 00:54:58.240
Then I also feel that you should not feel sorry later.

00:54:58.653 --> 00:55:01.800
 That is why, I am explaining to you,

00:55:02.157 --> 00:55:05.099
when we have created such beautiful atmosphere here,

00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:09.566
and gathered like one family members,

00:55:09.844 --> 00:55:11.477
and we all are together,

00:55:11.678 --> 00:55:17.440
then these elder brothers of yours should be acknowledged by you,

00:55:17.988 --> 00:55:21.520
that they are present and they should be recognized.

00:55:21.774 --> 00:55:26.217
And if you worship them and make them happy, it will be really good.

00:55:26.487 --> 00:55:28.881
But they don’t get pleased so soon.

00:55:29.318 --> 00:55:32.806
Until you are cleansed from within, they won’t be happy.

00:55:33.007 --> 00:55:36.761
So you clean yourself from within, and take a vow today

00:55:36.962 --> 00:55:41.009
that, in future we will completely discard all types of pettiness,

00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:44.719
frivolous act, and trivial matters.

00:55:45.228 --> 00:55:48.806
And we shall look up to these deities’ greatness and purity

00:55:49.007 --> 00:55:52.399
and consider them as our ideals and steer our lives in that direction.

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:56.400
If we do just this, it will be our benefit from all sides.

00:55:56.924 --> 00:55:58.892
My infinite blessings to you.

00:55:59.208 --> 00:56:03.096
And you all have come here with lots of love,

00:56:06.224 --> 00:56:09.040
I can not say thanks to you all,

00:56:10.072 --> 00:56:12.565
but it is just that my heart is deeply moved.

00:56:12.766 --> 00:56:15.425
and in this heart, you all are residing,

00:56:15.775 --> 00:56:18.192
and I love you all too much.

00:56:18.407 --> 00:56:22.080
and I look at you with immeasurable love.

00:56:22.342 --> 00:56:25.902
and my thoughts are always around your protection.

00:56:26.103 --> 00:56:29.800
My total attention and thoughts are towards you

00:56:30.268 --> 00:56:35.048
and for any kind of problem you can write to me,

00:56:35.278 --> 00:56:37.774
but you yourself should become pure,

00:56:37.975 --> 00:56:40.240
you should become clean,

00:56:40.454 --> 00:56:46.400
and you should become delightful and experience this joy till eternity.
