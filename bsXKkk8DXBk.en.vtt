00:05:00.287 --> 00:05:11.578
Today is a great day for all of us to be jubilant

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:19.329
that the Primordial Being Himself incarnated on this earth

00:05:19.329 --> 00:05:22.371
as Shri Krishna.

00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:38.465
So many aspects of His being have been described

00:05:38.505 --> 00:05:43.298
in so many of my lectures to you all;

00:05:43.298 --> 00:05:47.881
but the greatest and greatest of all the aspects

00:05:47.923 --> 00:05:51.881
of this Primordial Being

00:05:51.923 --> 00:05:55.756
was that He was the Yogeshwara.

00:05:55.797 --> 00:06:02.089
He was the God of Yoga - Yogeshwara.

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:15.256
He was the Lord of our Union with the Divine.

00:06:15.256 --> 00:06:23.589
Without His permission and without His sanction we cannot be Sahaja Yogis.

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:35.547
He was Yogeshwara and a real Yogi is a person

00:06:35.547 --> 00:06:45.423
who gets this Yogeshwara awakened within him.

00:06:45.423 --> 00:06:50.381
The word "Yoga", that we understand,

00:06:50.381 --> 00:07:04.048
is the union of our attention with the Divine.

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:09.714
But still we do not realize the implications --

00:07:09.756 --> 00:07:18.465
what does it mean? What should happen to us?

00:07:18.465 --> 00:07:21.173
Of course you get powers.

00:07:21.215 --> 00:07:24.797
As soon as you become the spirit you get powers.

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:28.506
One of the powers you get is of collective consciousness --

00:07:28.506 --> 00:07:31.298
that is also the gift of Shri Krishna --

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:35.256
and that you start feeling the collectivity.

00:07:35.298 --> 00:07:39.797
Your ego and superego is sucked in,

00:07:39.797 --> 00:07:46.048
so you get rid of your karmas and your conditionings

00:07:46.048 --> 00:07:51.256
and a new sprouting of the new life of the new age starts.

00:07:51.256 --> 00:08:01.340
But still what is the speciality, the greatness of Yogeshwara?

00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:12.589
Because He is Ishwara for you. He is the Ishwara of all the Yogis

00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:20.672
and what is His capacity, what is His nature?

00:08:20.714 --> 00:08:27.589
That for Him everything is a play - Leela.

00:08:27.631 --> 00:08:30.964
For Shri Rama it was not a play.

00:08:31.006 --> 00:08:44.465
For Him life was a platform on which he had to demonstrate

00:08:44.505 --> 00:08:53.714
how to lead a very dharmic life as Maryada Purushottama.

00:08:53.756 --> 00:09:10.256
But Shri Krishna came up to show that He is the Leeladhara --

00:09:10.256 --> 00:09:14.465
the one who plays the Leela, the play.

00:09:14.505 --> 00:09:21.340
The whole thing is a play, the whole universe is a play.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.797
All that is created by Adi Shakti, all these three gunas

00:09:25.839 --> 00:09:33.465
is nothing but a play. And that is what He manifested

00:09:33.505 --> 00:09:39.505
in His own incarnation. But still what is Yogeshwara?

00:09:39.505 --> 00:09:45.756
Leeladhara is the one for whom this whole universe is a play,

00:09:45.797 --> 00:09:49.923
that He is at the axis, and for the whole periphery

00:09:49.964 --> 00:10:00.006
is nothing but a play. Because everything is false.

00:10:00.006 --> 00:10:06.423
Except for your spirit everything is false.

00:10:06.465 --> 00:10:13.465
It's all a joke going on, you can say,

00:10:13.505 --> 00:10:16.215
a drama going on, nothing so serious.

00:10:16.256 --> 00:10:21.006
Spirit is the only truth within us the rest is all untruth.

00:10:21.048 --> 00:10:26.048
There cannot be many types of truths you see.

00:10:26.089 --> 00:10:28.756
In Sanskrit language there is only truth or untruth,

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:32.215
satya or asatya, there are no ten words for truth.

00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:36.714
So when this happens,

00:10:36.756 --> 00:10:42.173
this great happening takes place within you,

00:10:42.215 --> 00:10:46.173
when you become one with [the] Spirit you get powers

00:10:46.215 --> 00:10:53.215
without even your maturity reaching that stage,

00:10:53.215 --> 00:10:57.756
your understanding reaching that stage

00:10:57.756 --> 00:11:04.006
and your heart opening out.

00:11:04.048 --> 00:11:12.756
so that you have faith with open understanding.

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:17.298
You should have faith with experience of it

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.173
so it starts off. When you start using your powers

00:11:21.173 --> 00:11:25.465
you see it is manifesting, you are sometimes amazed,

00:11:25.505 --> 00:11:27.465
how you raise Kundalini of people,

00:11:27.465 --> 00:11:32.089
how you tie them up, how you give them realization,

00:11:32.131 --> 00:11:34.048
how you cure people.

00:11:34.048 --> 00:11:36.173
You are amazed, how it has happened.

00:11:36.215 --> 00:11:40.298
So we can say it is all built within you

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.381
which has started manifesting.

00:11:42.423 --> 00:11:48.340
But there is so much more that has to still manifest,

00:11:48.381 --> 00:11:54.131
which has to establish and make you grow.

00:11:54.173 --> 00:11:59.131
One of the very important points is the Yogeshwara

00:11:59.173 --> 00:12:04.672
and that point we must understand

00:12:04.714 --> 00:12:13.423
that unless and until you follow the path of Yogeshwara,

00:12:13.423 --> 00:12:17.006
you cannot establish yourself fully.

00:12:17.048 --> 00:12:20.173
So Krishna has said that:

00:12:20.215 --> 00:12:24.714
"Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja"

00:12:24.756 --> 00:12:28.964
"You give up all your relationships...",

00:12:29.006 --> 00:12:34.381
dharma is relationship. Like your sister, your brother

00:12:34.423 --> 00:12:40.547
you see these are dharmas, like Sri dharma  a woman's job.

00:12:40.589 --> 00:12:46.465
Then we can say also there is Rashta dharma.

00:12:46.505 --> 00:12:51.423
Today is the day of India's freedom.

00:12:51.423 --> 00:12:56.547
So we have Rashta dharma, we are patriotic people.

00:12:56.547 --> 00:13:01.964
Patriotism to your own country is Rashta dharma.

00:13:02.006 --> 00:13:06.714
Then you have got Samaj dharma

00:13:06.714 --> 00:13:13.505
that is duty towards your society, is Samaj dharma.

00:13:13.506 --> 00:13:19.381
Then you have got Pati dharma, husbands' duties,

00:13:19.381 --> 00:13:28.131
wives' duties. Everybody's duties are called as dharmas

00:13:28.173 --> 00:13:31.048
because this is what you have to do,

00:13:31.048 --> 00:13:34.964
you are duty bound - they form your dharmas.

00:13:35.006 --> 00:13:38.215
But He says, "Give up all these dharmas,

00:13:38.256 --> 00:13:42.797
give up all the duties, just surrender yourself fully to Me"

00:13:42.797 --> 00:13:46.672
"Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja".

00:13:46.714 --> 00:13:51.381
Because you have become now the collective being,

00:13:51.381 --> 00:13:54.340
now you have become one with Him,

00:13:54.381 --> 00:13:56.714
now He looks after your dharmas,

00:13:56.756 --> 00:13:58.714
He looks after your relationships,

00:13:58.756 --> 00:14:01.048
He cleanses them, He purifies them,

00:14:01.089 --> 00:14:04.298
so you just surrender yourself to Him fully.

00:14:04.298 --> 00:14:11.006
He said it to Shri Arjuna only not to everyone.

00:14:11.048 --> 00:14:13.839
He didn't say to everyone they didn't deserve it,

00:14:13.881 --> 00:14:16.547
or He didn't think it proper to say to them.

00:14:16.589 --> 00:14:20.631
But I think you are proper people to know this

00:14:20.672 --> 00:14:25.298
so I'm telling you that: forget every other duty

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.131
to every other thing but do your duty

00:14:28.173 --> 00:14:33.048
to your collective being, to your collectivity.

00:14:33.089 --> 00:14:39.131
But He is Yogeshwara. That's the main point.

00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:43.465
And to do duty to Him first and foremost thing

00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:49.839
is you have to develop that purity of a Yogeshwara.

00:14:49.881 --> 00:14:59.923
For Him sublimation was not needed  He was sublime.

00:14:59.964 --> 00:15:02.215
He was the source of sublimation.

00:15:02.256 --> 00:15:06.423
He did not need sublimation from the baser instincts

00:15:06.465 --> 00:15:13.256
of human beings. He did not need anything to do,

00:15:13.256 --> 00:15:17.547
to be done to Himself to raise Himself out of the maya

00:15:17.589 --> 00:15:22.256
as they call it. Especially in the West, as you know,

00:15:22.256 --> 00:15:28.631
we have created a hell for ourselves - real hell.

00:15:28.672 --> 00:15:34.298
All kinds of perverted ideas are within us.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.173
To a Yogeshwara this is nothing but maya,

00:15:37.215 --> 00:15:44.714
absolutely filth. Never comes into His [mind]

00:15:44.756 --> 00:15:47.923
that such things are possible - they are shocking.

00:15:47.964 --> 00:15:52.881
On His birthday - I would say if today is His birthday

00:15:52.923 --> 00:15:57.256
and if He was born as He was at that time --

00:15:57.298 --> 00:16:01.465
He would have gone back immediately.

00:16:01.505 --> 00:16:06.839
He would have said, "No sorry, I've nothing to do,

00:16:06.839 --> 00:16:08.923
had enough." And that too,

00:16:08.964 --> 00:16:10.964
if He had met the Western culture,

00:16:10.964 --> 00:16:12.340
He would have been shocked back

00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:14.923
he [would have] said, "Oh God, no, nothing doing.

00:16:14.964 --> 00:16:17.381
I'm not coming here.

00:16:17.423 --> 00:16:21.173
Despite the times when He was born,

00:16:21.215 --> 00:16:23.423
where there was dharma, there were people

00:16:23.423 --> 00:16:25.340
[who] understood what was right, what was wrong.

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.964
When there was none of these nonsensical things

00:16:27.964 --> 00:16:32.964
were there - He came as Yogeshwara - pure.

00:16:33.006 --> 00:16:41.964
The story of His is that once His wives wanted to go...

00:16:41.964 --> 00:16:46.173
to Him what was wives? Nothing - is just a play.

00:16:46.173 --> 00:16:48.589
To Him no sin can be attached.

00:16:48.631 --> 00:16:51.298
He married because He had to marry

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:56.423
His five principles or the five elements.

00:16:56.465 --> 00:16:59.089
So He made them into women and married them.

00:16:59.131 --> 00:17:01.797
He had to marry 16,000 women

00:17:01.797 --> 00:17:06.923
because He had to have 16,000 powers

00:17:06.923 --> 00:17:12.756
and He had to channelize them through some bodies,

00:17:12.756 --> 00:17:14.881
so they came as women.

00:17:14.923 --> 00:17:19.423
To Him it was not a relationship of a wife

00:17:19.465 --> 00:17:22.256
but a pure relationship.

00:17:22.256 --> 00:17:26.589
To Him sex had no existence at all.

00:17:26.631 --> 00:17:30.923
He was beyond it.

00:17:30.964 --> 00:17:32.714
So no question of temptations

00:17:32.756 --> 00:17:35.131
and perversions - is out of [the] question.

00:17:35.131 --> 00:17:41.048
The story is that once His five wives wanted to go

00:17:41.089 --> 00:17:45.506
and pray to some saint who had come,

00:17:45.506 --> 00:17:53.923
a great saint, to their town.

00:17:53.923 --> 00:17:57.756
But he really stayed across the river.

00:17:57.797 --> 00:18:01.631
So they wanted to go and worship him

00:18:01.672 --> 00:18:05.465
and they found a very good time when they could go and see him.

00:18:05.465 --> 00:18:10.756
So when they went near the river they said

00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:13.631
"It is in spate we cannot cross it,

00:18:13.672 --> 00:18:16.465
it's not the time that you can cross it."

00:18:16.505 --> 00:18:22.672
So they felt it was very inauspicious if they did not go

00:18:22.672 --> 00:18:25.006
and that was such an auspicious time.

00:18:25.048 --> 00:18:29.839
They wanted to go at that time and worship this guru.

00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:32.881
So they went to Krishna and said that

00:18:32.923 --> 00:18:35.714
"Now, how can we cross, the river is in spate?"

00:18:35.714 --> 00:18:42.048
He said: "Really? Doesn't matter.

00:18:42.089 --> 00:18:49.298
You go and tell the river.." - that is the river Yamuna river,

00:18:49.298 --> 00:18:52.506
no I'm sorry  Tapi, Tapi river..

00:18:52.547 --> 00:19:03.672
He said "Go and tell the river that 'if we have a husband

00:19:03.714 --> 00:19:11.340
who is Shri Krishna, is a Yogeshwara - that means

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.298
who has never indulged into any sex activity..."

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.131
Yogeshwara means a person who has never indulged

00:19:18.131 --> 00:19:21.589
into any sex relationships.

00:19:21.631 --> 00:19:26.547
That's not possible. One cannot think of such a thing.

00:19:26.589 --> 00:19:29.756
Means though He indulged, He never indulged into [it].

00:19:29.797 --> 00:19:37.756
Though He was in it still He was not there, like a lotus. "...

00:19:37.797 --> 00:19:45.631
If He has not indulged into any such action..." --

00:19:45.672 --> 00:19:51.672
it's a... only possible for Him, nobody else.

00:19:51.714 --> 00:19:53.506
That's why He is an incarnation,

00:19:53.547 --> 00:19:55.256
He's not a human being.

00:19:55.298 --> 00:19:56.923
Only incarnations can do it.

00:19:56.923 --> 00:19:58.839
If some human being starts saying that

00:19:58.881 --> 00:20:02.256
"I am Shri Krishna, so I am doing this and I am doing that",

00:20:02.298 --> 00:20:04.256
like you see, there are very bombastic ones,

00:20:04.298 --> 00:20:05.797
you must have heard about them.

00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:10.923
They do not become, is only an incarnation can do it.

00:20:10.964 --> 00:20:19.506
That means Yogeshwara is the one who had incarnated.

00:20:19.506 --> 00:20:24.089
So they went and told the river that,

00:20:24.089 --> 00:20:28.256
"If He is the Yogeshwara, then please you subside."

00:20:28.298 --> 00:20:35.672
And she went down. So they went to the other side,

00:20:35.672 --> 00:20:37.964
did the puja to the guru and they came back.

00:20:37.964 --> 00:20:41.089
Again the river was in spate and they could not cross.

00:20:41.089 --> 00:20:46.048
So they went to the guru.

00:20:46.089 --> 00:20:52.505
This is the sign of a good guru or a real guru,

00:20:52.505 --> 00:20:58.048
is an incarnated guru. And they said that

00:20:58.089 --> 00:21:01.756
"See, we cannot cross, the river is in spate."

00:21:01.756 --> 00:21:05.797
So they said: "Really, how did you come?"

00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:08.756
They said, "Shri Krishna asked us,

00:21:08.797 --> 00:21:15.506
that 'if I am the Yogeshwara, it will go down, you ask the question'."

00:21:15.547 --> 00:21:20.340
So he said: "All right, now you go and ask the question,

00:21:20.381 --> 00:21:37.839
that if I am the bhukta. Bhukta, that means

00:21:37.881 --> 00:21:41.714
if I have eaten all the food you have given me,

00:21:41.756 --> 00:21:45.547
but I have not enjoyed it, I've not indulged into it,

00:21:45.589 --> 00:21:50.672
then let the river subside."

00:21:50.672 --> 00:21:52.672
They went and told the river,

00:21:52.714 --> 00:21:54.423
I mean they could not believe it

00:21:54.465 --> 00:21:56.923
because they had fed him, that:

00:21:56.964 --> 00:21:58.756
"Whatever food we offered him,

00:21:58.756 --> 00:22:05.672
if he has not eaten any food, then you subside".

00:22:05.714 --> 00:22:07.506
And the river subsided!

00:22:07.547 --> 00:22:18.881
So the moral of the whole thing is that your ideal,

00:22:18.923 --> 00:22:28.340
your ideal again, in this respect, is Shri Krishna.

00:22:28.381 --> 00:22:37.797
Not that you think you are the ideal of the rest.

00:22:37.797 --> 00:22:41.839
This is the big mistake Sahaja Yogis do.

00:22:41.839 --> 00:22:44.964
They think immediately they have become now

00:22:45.006 --> 00:22:50.131
Shri Krishna or they have become something greater

00:22:50.173 --> 00:23:00.048
or that there is an ideal that they have imbibed within themselves

00:23:00.089 --> 00:23:05.173
It's not so - that one thing one has to know,

00:23:05.215 --> 00:23:13.006
that that is the ideal you have to reachand your eyes

00:23:13.048 --> 00:23:15.881
should be towards that ideal and the movement

00:23:15.881 --> 00:23:18.547
should be towards that. Before that,

00:23:18.589 --> 00:23:23.381
if you fall into any such thing like perversions

00:23:23.423 --> 00:23:26.256
and nonsensical sexual things and all that,

00:23:26.298 --> 00:23:28.923
you must know that you are falling down very badly.

00:23:28.964 --> 00:23:32.672
It's a possession that is working on you.

00:23:32.672 --> 00:23:37.048
That's an ideal - they are incarnations.

00:23:37.089 --> 00:23:41.173
You are not incarnations nor can you become incarnations.

00:23:41.215 --> 00:23:45.964
But they are the light, which are enlightening your path,

00:23:46.006 --> 00:23:50.506
on which you are walking. They are taking you to the realm

00:23:50.506 --> 00:23:53.672
where they are the Kings and they are the Lords.

00:23:53.672 --> 00:23:56.256
He is Ishwara - He is your Ishwara.

00:23:56.298 --> 00:24:01.964
You are not Ishwaras. But you are at least the Yogis.

00:24:01.964 --> 00:24:08.381
We have to be the yogis first, then He is our Ishwara, nah?

00:24:08.423 --> 00:24:10.465
Otherwise He doesn't want to rule you.

00:24:10.505 --> 00:24:16.048
So what we have to do, is to become the Yogis first.

00:24:16.048 --> 00:24:21.173
And one of the signs of a yogi is

00:24:21.215 --> 00:24:28.505
that he is in his sex life extremely pure.

00:24:28.505 --> 00:24:40.547
Absolutely purity must exist

00:24:40.547 --> 00:24:44.589
and after some time one should get beyond.

00:24:44.631 --> 00:24:53.173
Your relationships with other people,

00:24:53.215 --> 00:24:57.964
whether it is your sister or a brother

00:24:57.964 --> 00:25:00.756
or any other woman or any other man,

00:25:00.797 --> 00:25:05.631
there should be complete purity.

00:25:05.672 --> 00:25:11.923
And this is extremely important.

00:25:11.923 --> 00:25:18.923
Now in the countries like India, people are extremely corrupt,

00:25:18.923 --> 00:25:24.048
very corrupt, extremely corrupt. You can give them 5 rupees

00:25:24.089 --> 00:25:26.589
and you can buy anybody there.

00:25:26.631 --> 00:25:29.714
It's very corrupt, moneywise.

00:25:29.756 --> 00:25:34.964
But people are not so immoral, they know it is immorality,

00:25:34.964 --> 00:25:37.256
I mean they know. I mean if they do immoral thing

00:25:37.298 --> 00:25:39.923
they know it is not moral.

00:25:39.964 --> 00:25:44.505
In the West the immorality has become a general rule.

00:25:44.506 --> 00:25:47.631
For them the 'morality' word should vanish now.

00:25:47.672 --> 00:25:49.923
I mean it doesn't exist like morality.

00:25:49.923 --> 00:25:51.506
Do anything whatever you like,

00:25:51.547 --> 00:25:54.006
people don't think of immorality.

00:25:54.048 --> 00:25:58.173
They don't want to talk of it, "it is Victorian."

00:25:58.173 --> 00:26:01.589
And if somebody says that one should be moral,

00:26:01.589 --> 00:26:03.839
they start thinking he's an hypocrite.

00:26:03.839 --> 00:26:06.173
I mean they cannot think there can be any connection

00:26:06.215 --> 00:26:09.631
between human being and morality in a genuine way.

00:26:09.672 --> 00:26:14.506
This is a big problem we have. It's the biggest problem we have.

00:26:14.547 --> 00:26:20.089
Now corruption is something you can avoid

00:26:20.131 --> 00:26:25.298
because if you are not corrupt, it is alright, you can be.

00:26:25.298 --> 00:26:28.589
But immorality is such a thing that,

00:26:28.589 --> 00:26:35.547
if you live in an immoral world, it has effect on everyone.

00:26:35.547 --> 00:26:38.465
For example, a moral woman is walking on the road

00:26:38.465 --> 00:26:41.256
and there is a man full of lust and all that looking at her.

00:26:41.256 --> 00:26:45.797
In any way she looses her chastity.

00:26:45.797 --> 00:26:48.465
She doesn't mean to attract him or anything,

00:26:48.505 --> 00:26:50.256
she doesn't want to loose her chastity,

00:26:50.298 --> 00:26:53.465
but the way he is looking at her, you see,

00:26:53.505 --> 00:26:58.589
though her simple methods are there, she may be responsible

00:26:58.589 --> 00:27:02.089
in a distant way to ruin his chastity,

00:27:02.131 --> 00:27:07.006
his morality. Even a little child, who is a simple,

00:27:07.048 --> 00:27:10.215
innocent child but if there''s a dirty man with a dirty eyes,

00:27:10.215 --> 00:27:13.839
he can have very dirty feelings for the child.

00:27:13.881 --> 00:27:18.714
So, though of course that person himself is dirty and all that,

00:27:18.756 --> 00:27:20.756
we cannot say the child is not affected.

00:27:20.797 --> 00:27:23.465
But in a way, that becomes an object,

00:27:23.465 --> 00:27:26.006
a sort of a Vastu as you call it.

00:27:26.048 --> 00:27:30.839
A thing which makes another person

00:27:30.881 --> 00:27:33.923
even lower than what he is.

00:27:33.964 --> 00:27:38.173
Even an ordinary picture, which has nothing to do,

00:27:38.215 --> 00:27:40.964
is placed there, any funny thing

00:27:41.006 --> 00:27:46.131
which is giving some dirty feelings.

00:27:46.173 --> 00:27:51.256
Because these days I have seen so many symbols

00:27:51.298 --> 00:27:55.131
have started, which to my eye I don't even see

00:27:55.131 --> 00:27:57.048
there is anything wrong in it.

00:27:57.089 --> 00:28:00.340
That to my eye I can't see because I'm too innocent.

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:03.256
My eyes can't see [that] there''s anything wrong.

00:28:03.298 --> 00:28:06.006
But to somebody, who is an expert on these things,

00:28:06.006 --> 00:28:08.631
[he] will immediately say, "oh look at this."

00:28:08.672 --> 00:28:13.714
I mean really it is impossible to understand

00:28:13.756 --> 00:28:17.423
how the human mind has really woven their yarns

00:28:17.465 --> 00:28:19.797
all around and made these patterns

00:28:19.839 --> 00:28:22.298
to ruin themselves and ruin others.

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:33.256
So to worship Yogeshwara we must know

00:28:33.298 --> 00:28:40.340
that our relationships with everyone in this world

00:28:40.381 --> 00:28:42.505
has to be pure.

00:28:42.505 --> 00:28:49.215
He played lots of things in His lifetime.

00:28:49.256 --> 00:28:52.131
The time when He came,

00:28:52.173 --> 00:28:58.381
the whole country was absolutely drowned

00:28:58.423 --> 00:29:02.048
into fanatic ideas about religion.

00:29:02.089 --> 00:29:07.672
If Freud was there he would have said,

00:29:07.714 --> 00:29:11.465
"oh this is all nonsense" you see, "What's wrong? Go ahead."

00:29:11.465 --> 00:29:16.381
Krishna did not do that.

00:29:16.381 --> 00:29:23.089
He wanted to break all the nonsensical shackles

00:29:23.131 --> 00:29:30.131
of traditions and shackles of false fanaticism.

00:29:30.173 --> 00:29:35.173
But He did it in a very beautiful manner

00:29:35.215 --> 00:29:39.173
keeping the relationship absolutely pure.

00:29:39.173 --> 00:29:44.465
Now people ask questions,

00:29:44.505 --> 00:29:46.964
"Mother, was He married to Radha?"

00:29:47.006 --> 00:29:49.881
You know He's eternally married to Her, doesn't matter.

00:29:49.923 --> 00:29:53.714
But He actually performed the marriage

00:29:53.714 --> 00:29:59.881
just the day He was born. He was brought by His father

00:29:59.881 --> 00:30:04.964
across the river and put down on the bank of the river,

00:30:05.006 --> 00:30:09.465
when Shri Brahmadeva himself came on this earth.

00:30:09.505 --> 00:30:13.465
That's why He wears a yellow thing, always,

00:30:13.505 --> 00:30:18.465
as a blessing from Brahmadeva to cover His lower part,

00:30:18.505 --> 00:30:23.839
lower than the waist with a cloth. That's the sign.

00:30:23.839 --> 00:30:26.631
That's why He always wears yellow.

00:30:26.672 --> 00:30:34.881
He himself came, made Him into man and married Him to Radhaji.

00:30:34.923 --> 00:30:43.298
Then again He became a child just to appear to be a child.

00:30:43.298 --> 00:30:45.589
Somebody may appear to be a child.

00:30:45.589 --> 00:30:48.215
To some of you I appear to you to be a sixteen-year-old girl

00:30:48.256 --> 00:30:50.506
as you say, but I'm not.

00:30:50.547 --> 00:30:54.923
While I may be, according to counting,

00:30:54.923 --> 00:30:58.298
might be sixty years of age, but I'm not.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:04.839
My age is eternal. I can't say what age is Mine.

00:31:04.839 --> 00:31:11.547
It could be two years old or it could be absolutelyancient.

00:31:11.589 --> 00:31:13.672
It could be anything.

00:31:13.672 --> 00:31:22.048
So in His whole life, whatever He did,

00:31:22.089 --> 00:31:25.465
He did with the purity of understanding.

00:31:25.505 --> 00:31:28.215
So Radhaji was married to Him first.

00:31:28.215 --> 00:31:35.423
And afterwards when He came as a child,

00:31:35.465 --> 00:31:40.506
when He was a child, He did all kinds of pranks and things.

00:31:40.547 --> 00:31:43.215
It was nothing but Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:43.256 --> 00:31:46.714
It was not sitting like this and seriously telling about things.

00:31:46.756 --> 00:31:49.215
But with little bit here and there

00:31:49.215 --> 00:31:56.756
He tried to improve their chakras and raise their Kundalinis.

00:31:56.756 --> 00:32:00.465
Of course realization was not possible in a game.

00:32:00.465 --> 00:32:04.089
You cannot do it. Supposing I just play about with you

00:32:04.131 --> 00:32:06.964
you cannot get your realization

00:32:07.006 --> 00:32:10.465
because at the Sahastrara stage

00:32:10.465 --> 00:32:13.006
you have to completely recognize.

00:32:13.006 --> 00:32:24.506
It has to be a game of serenity.

00:32:24.547 --> 00:32:29.714
Of course, you can just raise your hand

00:32:29.756 --> 00:32:32.256
and give realization to people.

00:32:32.298 --> 00:32:35.048
But you have to bring them to serene level.

00:32:35.089 --> 00:32:39.672
If you just came andsaid, "alright, you now play about",

00:32:39.714 --> 00:32:42.006
it would be all finished.

00:32:42.048 --> 00:32:44.048
You have to sit down and meditate.

00:32:44.048 --> 00:32:47.589
Though He has said it in Geeta you have to do it.

00:32:47.589 --> 00:32:52.173
So one could not say that all the time if you are playing,

00:32:52.173 --> 00:32:54.256
if you are just singing songs,

00:32:54.256 --> 00:33:00.131
or if you are in a very happy mood, a mirthful mood,

00:33:00.173 --> 00:33:03.173
then it's the end of Sahaja Yoga. It is not.

00:33:03.173 --> 00:33:06.173
It's a serious matter.

00:33:06.173 --> 00:33:10.423
So He did not give them realization

00:33:10.465 --> 00:33:13.423
but He reduced the tension on their minds

00:33:13.423 --> 00:33:19.964
of the so-called dharma and its shackles of fanaticism

00:33:19.964 --> 00:33:24.756
and He made it loose and then He wanted them

00:33:24.756 --> 00:33:29.131
to understand that dharma is not

00:33:29.173 --> 00:33:32.631
going to enslave you.

00:33:32.672 --> 00:33:34.631
You have to rise above the dharma --

00:33:34.672 --> 00:33:39.048
become dharma itself.

00:33:39.089 --> 00:33:52.006
But Yogeshwara is to be worshipped with pure heart.

00:33:52.048 --> 00:34:00.672
In this atmosphere it''s difficult, I know.

00:34:00.714 --> 00:34:05.131
You just go out and you see a horrid thing there.

00:34:05.131 --> 00:34:07.714
You open any page of the magazine,

00:34:07.756 --> 00:34:11.589
there''s another horrid thing. Anywhere you advertise Me

00:34:11.589 --> 00:34:15.714
the next page I turn I find a discotheque nonsense

00:34:15.756 --> 00:34:17.923
going on there. I mean what can you do,

00:34:17.923 --> 00:34:22.256
you just can't help it. And all this is on, I mean,

00:34:22.298 --> 00:34:27.547
if you look at it - how gross, dirty, filthy the whole thing is.

00:34:27.547 --> 00:34:32.839
To add to problems, psychologists have come forward.

00:34:32.881 --> 00:34:37.256
They themselves are affected by their methods

00:34:37.256 --> 00:34:39.298
and everything, they are so possessed

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:46.756
and their sense about morality is absolutely in complete confusion.

00:34:46.797 --> 00:34:48.215
No doubt about it.

00:34:48.256 --> 00:34:50.340
You know Freud, what happened to him?

00:34:50.381 --> 00:34:52.672
He was having relations with his mother.

00:34:52.714 --> 00:34:54.839
He couldn't even understand, I mean imagine

00:34:54.839 --> 00:34:57.964
what a adharmi he must be, horrible wretched fellow,

00:34:58.006 --> 00:35:01.881
he did not even have that purity to understand

00:35:01.923 --> 00:35:04.340
relationship with a mother. I mean, imagine.

00:35:04.381 --> 00:35:08.173
It is such a clear-cut background of this man.

00:35:08.215 --> 00:35:11.048
Shows how wrong he must have been.

00:35:11.048 --> 00:35:16.256
Because what was in him, such filth, such dirt,

00:35:16.298 --> 00:35:21.923
that he could not even look at his mother with clear heart.

00:35:21.964 --> 00:35:25.964
Must be all mud in his eyes or I don't know what he be like,

00:35:26.006 --> 00:35:28.381
to see things like that.

00:35:28.423 --> 00:35:36.215
You are shaking with my vibrations already.

00:35:36.256 --> 00:35:42.672
Now when we think of Him as Yogeshwara

00:35:42.714 --> 00:35:46.672
that means we are Yogis and He is our Ishwara.

00:35:46.714 --> 00:35:55.797
Ishwara is to be praised - Dhayaati??

00:35:55.839 --> 00:36:03.589
you have to praise Him. You have to praise Him

00:36:03.589 --> 00:36:09.547
for his quality as Yogeshwara because He is your Ishwara

00:36:09.547 --> 00:36:11.505
so you have to praise Him.

00:36:11.505 --> 00:36:14.465
Now what praise can we give Him.

00:36:14.505 --> 00:36:20.465
Today He's born. What should we do

00:36:20.505 --> 00:36:23.839
on such a great occasion when He is born?

00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:32.173
We have to decide that He is our Ishwara.

00:36:32.215 --> 00:36:40.173
He is the Ishwara aspect and if He is our Ishwara

00:36:40.173 --> 00:36:48.256
then we have to cleanse our attitude towards sex,

00:36:48.256 --> 00:36:57.381
towards the gross way of life that we have developed,

00:36:57.423 --> 00:37:03.131
to just shun it and throw it away. Absolutely.

00:37:03.173 --> 00:37:06.173
There cannot be compromise on that

00:37:06.173 --> 00:37:15.256
otherwise you cannot be a yogi, you cannot be a yogi.

00:37:15.298 --> 00:37:19.423
You may become very powerful, maybe for the time being.

00:37:19.465 --> 00:37:21.714
Because I play with you, you get ideas

00:37:21.714 --> 00:37:25.923
that you are very powerful and all that. But that's not true.

00:37:25.964 --> 00:37:32.256
As My name is Nirmala, as My name is purity --

00:37:32.256 --> 00:37:35.215
you have to be pure yogis.

00:37:35.256 --> 00:37:41.215
Nobody says you should not marry.

00:37:41.215 --> 00:37:44.506
Nobody says you should not have proper sex relationships

00:37:44.547 --> 00:37:47.505
with you wives, that's not done.

00:37:47.506 --> 00:37:53.048
But that's one thing people may avoid and spoil it.

00:37:53.089 --> 00:37:58.797
But the other thing, which is the most important, is your attention

00:37:58.797 --> 00:38:06.672
to be pure of sex attractions [of] any kind.

00:38:06.672 --> 00:38:11.340
Your attention should never go to anything like that.

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:24.881
You see to Me, I mean I'm now supposed to be an old lady, I don't see things

00:38:24.881 --> 00:38:29.048
which normally people see. This is something surprising.

00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:32.298
You see, I see something and I don't know what's happening

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.797
and everybody laughs at me in the house you see.

00:38:34.839 --> 00:38:37.589
They don't understand that - how I didn't see the point.

00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:39.797
But I don't understand these jokes

00:38:39.839 --> 00:38:42.923
because the attention never goes into these dirty things,

00:38:42.964 --> 00:38:46.089
never goes into these things. I can't see,

00:38:46.131 --> 00:38:48.547
till somebody tells me that 'this is this.'

00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:50.923
But they have to explain ten times.

00:38:50.923 --> 00:38:57.131
So all these sophisticated methods of nonsense

00:38:57.131 --> 00:39:02.547
and the filth and the dirt that we have accumulated here,

00:39:02.547 --> 00:39:05.631
please wash off your hands of that.

00:39:05.672 --> 00:39:09.589
That's one thing, will not be tolerated in Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:09.631 --> 00:39:12.215
Every Sahaja Yogi I must tell.

00:39:12.215 --> 00:39:18.215
Itself, sex cannot be enjoyed, if you live like this.

00:39:18.256 --> 00:39:20.923
You cannot! You don't enjoy sex at all in this country.

00:39:20.964 --> 00:39:24.298
None of them.

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:26.756
Only in a country, where people are innocent,

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:29.131
you can enjoy. If you were enjoying,

00:39:29.173 --> 00:39:31.173
you would not run from one woman to another woman,

00:39:31.215 --> 00:39:33.839
you would not run from man to woman and man to man

00:39:33.881 --> 00:39:37.089
and then to all donkeys all those things.

00:39:37.131 --> 00:39:44.923
It is impossible that you could be a yogi

00:39:44.923 --> 00:39:47.881
with all these dirty ideas.

00:39:47.923 --> 00:39:54.547
And then you cannot mature,

00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:56.547
even a normal person won't mature.

00:39:56.589 --> 00:39:58.672
In India a person who is about 40 years,

00:39:58.672 --> 00:40:00.839
he becomes a matured father.

00:40:00.839 --> 00:40:03.173
You leave any girls with him, anybody with him,

00:40:03.173 --> 00:40:05.089
it will not even get into his head

00:40:05.131 --> 00:40:08.256
that there's something could exist between them.

00:40:08.298 --> 00:40:10.215
Once you are married it should not.

00:40:10.215 --> 00:40:12.048
I mean I have seen my two son-inlaws,

00:40:12.089 --> 00:40:14.256
they never get these ideas into their heads.

00:40:14.298 --> 00:40:25.589
So try to put your attention onto proper track

00:40:25.631 --> 00:40:28.797
because your Ishwara is Yogeshwara.

00:40:28.839 --> 00:40:31.672
Now the other side of Shri Krishna

00:40:31.672 --> 00:40:33.881
people do not know.

00:40:33.923 --> 00:40:38.298
It's a play, all right. But He is Samhara-shakti.

00:40:38.298 --> 00:40:46.089
He is the power of destruction. It's very good,

00:40:46.089 --> 00:40:50.089
He's there, comes with everything to protect us.

00:40:50.131 --> 00:40:55.256
But He also has got Sudarshan chakra. Sudarshan,

00:40:55.298 --> 00:41:00.340
'su' means auspicious, "darshan" is vision.

00:41:00.381 --> 00:41:04.340
He gives us auspicious visions, you see.

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:09.340
If you try tricks with Him, that goes round your neck

00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:15.048
and then you have auspicious darshans of yourself,

00:41:15.089 --> 00:41:17.881
that you are hanging in the air somewhere.

00:41:17.923 --> 00:41:24.298
So Shri Krishna's methods; on one side

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:30.797
He is a "Leelamayi", He is compassionate,

00:41:30.797 --> 00:41:36.881
He stands by His bhaktas, He comes on this earth

00:41:36.923 --> 00:41:42.505
to revive the dharma. If the dharma goes down,

00:41:42.505 --> 00:41:47.298
He comes to uplift it. "Yada yada hi dharmasya" --

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.423
"whenever there is the decline of dharma."

00:41:50.465 --> 00:41:53.215
But dharma doesn't mean only corruption,

00:41:53.215 --> 00:41:56.048
it doesn't mean only honesty and dishonesty.

00:41:56.089 --> 00:42:01.839
Basically it means Mooladhara.

00:42:01.881 --> 00:42:07.215
That is the beginning of the end.

00:42:07.215 --> 00:42:11.714
And He comes to - "sa sansthapana arthaya" --

00:42:11.714 --> 00:42:16.964
again to establish into the holy state.

00:42:17.006 --> 00:42:22.506
He comes on this earth to raise human beings to that level.

00:42:22.547 --> 00:42:37.672
This is what He does. So if we are Sahaja Yogis,

00:42:37.714 --> 00:42:41.881
we are part and parcel of His Being.

00:42:41.881 --> 00:42:49.006
We are instruments into His working.

00:42:49.048 --> 00:42:52.589
So we have to establish dharma, but the one,

00:42:52.589 --> 00:42:54.923
who has no dharma within himself,

00:42:54.964 --> 00:42:58.256
what dharma is he going to establish anywhere?

00:42:58.298 --> 00:43:04.131
You have come on this earth to establish the dharma

00:43:04.173 --> 00:43:09.298
in its holy aspect. Not like Roman Catholic church

00:43:09.298 --> 00:43:12.505
or another Pentecostal church

00:43:12.506 --> 00:43:17.797
or these Hindu religious activities

00:43:17.797 --> 00:43:19.839
or these Hindu temples

00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:22.505
or the Islamic state.

00:43:22.505 --> 00:43:27.215
But dharma in its pure state you have to establish.

00:43:27.256 --> 00:43:29.006
But if there is no dharma within us,

00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:33.131
how are we going to establish?

00:43:33.131 --> 00:43:35.797
So He comes on this earth every time

00:43:35.839 --> 00:43:39.006
to establish dharma at Vishnu level.

00:43:39.006 --> 00:43:42.340
But at Shri Krishna level, He comes at Yogeshwara.

00:43:42.381 --> 00:43:47.797
This is the point many people have not even thought out.

00:43:47.839 --> 00:43:50.547
For Vishnu they may not say Yogeshwara.

00:43:50.589 --> 00:43:56.340
That is He is the Ishwara of Yogis,

00:43:56.340 --> 00:44:10.589
as Ganesha is the Ishwara of the Ganas.

00:44:10.631 --> 00:44:17.714
You see, it's the Ganapati [who] looks after the Ganas,

00:44:17.756 --> 00:44:23.089
and He is our Ishwara.

00:44:23.131 --> 00:44:27.547
That is we have to have Him as our ideal.

00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:33.256
With the understanding that today is the day --

00:44:33.298 --> 00:44:35.923
in the night about 12 o'clock,

00:44:35.923 --> 00:44:39.672
now must be about 12 o'clock in India also, about that,

00:44:39.672 --> 00:44:51.547
so it matches - He was born at this time in the night,

00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:55.881
because it was real night symbolically,

00:44:55.923 --> 00:45:01.006
under horrible circumstances.

00:45:01.048 --> 00:45:07.881
He came, at a time,

00:45:07.881 --> 00:45:15.714
when His own birth was very dangerously placed.

00:45:15.756 --> 00:45:22.006
He was saved, and then, in His very childhood

00:45:22.048 --> 00:45:33.465
He killed Rakshasas. But all this He did

00:45:33.505 --> 00:45:35.048
because He was an incarnation.

00:45:35.089 --> 00:45:38.505
Nobody is asking you to go and kill Rakshasas. Is it?

00:45:38.506 --> 00:45:42.589
In Sahaja Yoga did I ask you to go and kill some Rakshasas?

00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:46.131
On the contrary I'm just saying -keep yourself protected.

00:45:46.173 --> 00:45:54.048
There was a Rakshasin who came, her name was Putana

00:45:54.048 --> 00:46:01.173
and she wanted to put poison through her breast

00:46:01.215 --> 00:46:05.381
and she took the child and started nursing.

00:46:05.423 --> 00:46:09.672
He was a little baby. And when He started sucking her breast,

00:46:09.714 --> 00:46:18.256
she came out in her true form and she died.

00:46:18.298 --> 00:46:24.089
Because He was, after all, He was an incarnation.

00:46:24.089 --> 00:46:26.298
Can anyone of us do that?

00:46:28.881 --> 00:46:30.131
I mean the Sahaja Yogis?

00:46:30.173 --> 00:46:37.381
Then as a child He was very mischievous.

00:46:37.381 --> 00:46:47.173
He ate some clay, I think.

00:46:47.215 --> 00:46:50.256
Whether He ate it or not, His mother doubted.

00:46:50.298 --> 00:46:52.173
She got very angry and she said:

00:46:52.173 --> 00:46:55.089
"Open your mouth, I would like to see, did you eat that?"

00:46:55.089 --> 00:46:57.923
When He opened the mouth - she saw a complete universe

00:46:57.964 --> 00:47:04.714
moving in His throat - because Vishuddhi chakra She saw.

00:47:04.756 --> 00:47:08.340
Because she could see. She had power to see, she could see.

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:12.006
Not...everybody can't see that.

00:47:12.048 --> 00:47:16.256
Those who have powers can see.

00:47:16.298 --> 00:47:21.465
We don't even have the powers as much as she had

00:47:21.465 --> 00:47:24.714
to see the universe.

00:47:24.714 --> 00:47:32.465
So one has to understand that first, as Sahaja Yogis,

00:47:32.465 --> 00:47:37.506
we get the powers much before we have passed,

00:47:37.506 --> 00:47:44.173
really, the test of Sahaja Yogis.

00:47:44.215 --> 00:47:46.215
Just the other way round it is.

00:47:46.215 --> 00:47:50.506
In the university they will first give you the degree,

00:47:50.506 --> 00:47:54.964
the certificate and then you will get a job,

00:47:55.006 --> 00:48:00.964
may not get job also, these days!

00:48:01.006 --> 00:48:07.423
Here you get the job first of all, you get all the powers

00:48:07.423 --> 00:48:12.215
you are paid for, but the degree is still not sure.

00:48:12.256 --> 00:48:15.964
Anybody walks about as Sahaja Yogi,

00:48:16.006 --> 00:48:19.964
next day I find him coming out with something else.

00:48:20.006 --> 00:48:26.089
They are certified Sahaja Yogis, I have seen.

00:48:26.131 --> 00:48:33.589
They become afterwards certified something else.

00:48:33.631 --> 00:48:37.714
God knows how. So this is the thing of Sahaja Yoga

00:48:37.756 --> 00:48:40.423
that you can become a Sahaja Yogi

00:48:40.423 --> 00:48:44.423
even without having the real certificate.

00:48:44.423 --> 00:48:50.089
It's definitely so. And the certificate is given,

00:48:50.131 --> 00:48:52.714
as you know, by Lord Jesus Christ.

00:48:52.714 --> 00:48:57.714
He doesn't give certificate easily.

00:48:57.714 --> 00:49:03.006
That way He is very, very strict.

00:49:03.048 --> 00:49:08.589
He is not going to give you. He''s extremely strict

00:49:08.631 --> 00:49:11.881
as far as the Sahaja Yogis are concerned,

00:49:11.881 --> 00:49:13.881
He''s not going to give you certificates,

00:49:13.881 --> 00:49:19.256
He's going to judge you. And what is His basic nature, is He's innocence.

00:49:19.298 --> 00:49:23.631
He is going to judge you on your innocence.

00:49:23.672 --> 00:49:27.714
If you are a superego you can say,

00:49:27.756 --> 00:49:30.506
Oh I got possessed by a bhoot, you see,

00:49:30.547 --> 00:49:32.506
and the bhoot did this. So He will say:

00:49:32.547 --> 00:49:36.547
"Alright you go to the bhoot for the certificate not to me."

00:49:36.547 --> 00:49:40.714
Even when Yogis fight, I've seen, they tell me,

00:49:40.756 --> 00:49:43.839
"Mother, must be my bhoot and his bhoot must have fought".

00:49:43.881 --> 00:49:46.006
And what were you doing?

00:49:46.006 --> 00:49:54.506
They were witnessing it like Shri Krishnas!

00:49:54.547 --> 00:49:59.298
With all these things happening,

00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:10.631
I get a big promise sometimes, that, "Mother, alright,

00:50:10.631 --> 00:50:13.465
now we are not going to quarrel,

00:50:13.465 --> 00:50:18.298
there's not going to be any problem, you rest assured,

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:24.839
we'll all live in harmony." Then suddenly I find

00:50:24.839 --> 00:50:27.381
that somebody is fighting for a bathroom

00:50:27.423 --> 00:50:30.672
or for a soap or something like that.

00:50:30.714 --> 00:50:34.631
That's not for a Sahaja Yogi to behave.

00:50:34.631 --> 00:50:40.465
First of all you have to be a satisfied person,

00:50:40.465 --> 00:50:45.797
a person of great dignity and forbearance,

00:50:45.839 --> 00:50:49.423
otherwise what are you going to bear?

00:50:49.423 --> 00:51:01.672
"I love him very much, but he should not have taken my towel."

00:51:01.714 --> 00:51:07.797
For small, small things if you go on insisting,

00:51:07.839 --> 00:51:15.256
be sure you are not a yogi as yet.

00:51:15.256 --> 00:51:18.298
If you are fighting for things,

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:21.089
then you are not a Sahaja Yogi at all.

00:51:21.131 --> 00:51:22.547
What do these things matter?

00:51:22.589 --> 00:51:25.131
I never say anything about anything, do I?

00:51:25.173 --> 00:51:27.256
That "I must have this, I must have that,

00:51:27.256 --> 00:51:28.881
how did you prepare this?"

00:51:28.923 --> 00:51:31.631
Though it is sometimes really wrong and unprotocolish.

00:51:31.631 --> 00:51:34.381
I never say that, "Why did you bring these bananas,

00:51:34.423 --> 00:51:37.964
they are no good, I'm not going to eat!" Did I say so?

00:51:38.006 --> 00:51:42.839
I mean, even the flowers you use may not be auspicious.

00:51:42.839 --> 00:51:45.714
I know certain flowers should not be used for puja.

00:51:45.756 --> 00:51:48.714
But I have not opened my mouth. If I have to tell you,

00:51:48.756 --> 00:51:51.797
I just tell you because you have to know it

00:51:51.839 --> 00:51:56.131
for your own good, not for my good.

00:51:56.173 --> 00:52:04.215
So, on a day like this, which is a day of great joy

00:52:04.256 --> 00:52:06.923
to all the world, and happiness,

00:52:06.923 --> 00:52:11.298
you should know one thing, that, when Christ was born,

00:52:11.298 --> 00:52:14.714
he was born in a very humble place,

00:52:14.756 --> 00:52:17.964
but when Krishna was born,

00:52:18.006 --> 00:52:25.423
He was born in the most horrifying circumstances.

00:52:25.465 --> 00:52:31.881
Same is the case of Sahaja Yogis today.

00:52:31.923 --> 00:52:34.547
It's a thing of great joy and jubilation, no doubt,

00:52:34.547 --> 00:52:37.547
that He came and he gave us His Vishuddi power,

00:52:37.547 --> 00:52:40.465
but we must understand that we are born

00:52:40.465 --> 00:52:43.048
in a very precarious time.

00:52:43.089 --> 00:52:46.131
I've been saying this so many times.

00:52:46.173 --> 00:52:50.048
There''s not only one Kamsa there. So many are there.

00:52:50.048 --> 00:52:52.672
There''s a big fight going on,

00:52:52.714 --> 00:52:55.923
in that you people are here in charge.

00:52:55.923 --> 00:52:59.881
You are the ones employed by God, you are the ones,

00:52:59.881 --> 00:53:08.089
who have been given this great work. You have powers.

00:53:08.131 --> 00:53:10.506
Like Shri Krishna, when He was crossing,

00:53:10.506 --> 00:53:13.964
as a child was put in a basket

00:53:14.006 --> 00:53:16.756
and the father was carrying the child in the basket

00:53:16.797 --> 00:53:20.173
and when His feet touched the river Yamuna,

00:53:20.173 --> 00:53:22.423
the river went down.

00:53:22.465 --> 00:53:24.964
Because she was in spate, she went down.

00:53:25.006 --> 00:53:28.672
In the same way, you too have all these powers.

00:53:28.672 --> 00:53:31.465
Krishna has given you all the powers.

00:53:31.505 --> 00:53:35.881
Though they will be really known to you,

00:53:35.923 --> 00:53:42.465
when only Lord Jesus Christ accepts you as Sahaja Yogis.

00:53:42.505 --> 00:53:48.505
That's important because you have to be innocent.

00:53:48.506 --> 00:53:52.381
Purity must be brought in.

00:53:52.381 --> 00:53:57.672
Last time on this great day we had 16 marriages.

00:53:57.672 --> 00:54:00.714
They came out well most of them.

00:54:00.714 --> 00:54:05.173
Not all, but most of them were very good

00:54:05.173 --> 00:54:07.089
and I am really very happy

00:54:07.131 --> 00:54:10.589
that such good couples came on that day.

00:54:10.589 --> 00:54:12.173
It was very auspicious.

00:54:12.215 --> 00:54:21.756
And marriage gives you a sense of purity

00:54:21.797 --> 00:54:29.631
and that's why our marriage is important in Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:29.631 --> 00:54:33.797
But that's not the last word, like this is not

00:54:33.797 --> 00:54:35.631
a hunting ground for everyone,

00:54:35.631 --> 00:54:38.714
"I'm finding out this husband or I'm finding out that husband."

00:54:38.756 --> 00:54:42.381
That must be stopped completely. Leave it to Sahaja.

00:54:42.381 --> 00:54:46.340
You are not to search out your wives in Sahaja Yogis,

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:49.506
no, not at all, nor husbands! Leave it!

00:54:49.547 --> 00:54:57.589
If you have done something like that, then you may be harmed.

00:54:57.589 --> 00:55:00.923
Don't do any searching or any thing.

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:04.839
A time will come, when you will find,

00:55:04.839 --> 00:55:08.006
I will myself tell you "alright, marry this person."

00:55:08.048 --> 00:55:10.881
It's still on among Sahaja Yogis, I have known people

00:55:10.923 --> 00:55:14.881
who just take out people and try courting.

00:55:14.923 --> 00:55:17.923
That's not needed in Sahaja Yoga, no courting needed.

00:55:17.923 --> 00:55:19.631
See, we have got so many cases,

00:55:19.672 --> 00:55:21.423
where the marriage was decided like that,

00:55:21.423 --> 00:55:23.298
they married, they are very happily married,

00:55:23.298 --> 00:55:26.089
than people who had courting, this thing, selections,

00:55:26.131 --> 00:55:29.881
and nominations and elections and everything.

00:55:29.881 --> 00:55:35.423
And after that you find within 2 days they are out for divorce.

00:55:35.423 --> 00:55:39.714
In Sahaja Yoga it is spontaneous,instantaneous.

00:55:39.756 --> 00:55:43.340
You don't have to do all these things

00:55:43.381 --> 00:55:46.048
with all these deliberations what have you achieved?

00:55:46.089 --> 00:55:50.547
It's just spontaneous. So you don't have to worry

00:55:50.547 --> 00:55:53.505
and you don't have to think. You don't have to say,

00:55:53.506 --> 00:55:56.048
that "Oh Mother, I have to find a girl for me"

00:55:56.089 --> 00:56:00.631
You see, you don't! Leave it me, it's my headache.

00:56:00.672 --> 00:56:04.340
But once you are married in Sahaja Yoga,

00:56:04.381 --> 00:56:06.672
you must know what it means.

00:56:06.714 --> 00:56:09.340
And both of you must work it out properly

00:56:09.381 --> 00:56:11.797
and it is for the good of everyone.

00:56:11.797 --> 00:56:21.006
Should be good for everyone.

00:56:21.006 --> 00:56:33.423
So, this is what it is. And I would say that, on this day,

00:56:33.465 --> 00:56:37.423
let us take one vow:

00:57:00.672 --> 00:57:06.298
To decide that we will be worshippingYogeshwara.

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.173
We have to worship Him.

00:57:08.215 --> 00:57:14.964
Means our relationships about these things has to be clean.

00:57:14.964 --> 00:57:19.089
We should not get involved into it, it''s nothing important.

00:57:19.131 --> 00:57:23.631
It's just like having your food,

00:57:23.672 --> 00:57:32.089
you have to be with your wife. Is the need of the body.

00:57:32.131 --> 00:57:45.006
You don't eat from the dirty plates, do you?

00:57:45.006 --> 00:57:48.215
You want to have a clean plate.

00:57:48.215 --> 00:57:51.672
You want to have a plate, which you have used yourself,

00:57:51.672 --> 00:57:56.505
your own plate that should be clean.

00:57:56.506 --> 00:57:59.381
If you could have a cleaner plate, you would like to have,

00:57:59.423 --> 00:58:01.465
if you can get a silver plate, you would like.

00:58:01.505 --> 00:58:05.089
If it is even a golden plate is even better.

00:58:05.089 --> 00:58:09.131
In the same way, we should also have

00:58:09.173 --> 00:58:15.506
a very pure understanding that, it is the need of the body,

00:58:15.506 --> 00:58:19.381
the body which can be very subtle.

00:58:19.423 --> 00:58:26.505
So let us not just go on shopping for it everywhere,

00:58:26.506 --> 00:58:28.756
looking out, "oh this is that, this one that one,"

00:58:28.797 --> 00:58:37.423
then discard this one. It has to come to you specially.

00:58:37.465 --> 00:58:43.215
And all great things happen suddenly. Always.

00:58:43.256 --> 00:58:51.423
The more deliberations you will have, the worse it will be.

00:58:51.465 --> 00:58:58.881
So don't form ideas, don't plan about it.

00:58:58.923 --> 00:59:02.340
It will happen. It''s not so important.

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:09.589
That will give you a lot of purity. Your ego will be perfect.

00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:16.797
I know of someone, whom nobody wanted to marry.

00:59:16.797 --> 00:59:21.506
And when I suggested someone,

00:59:21.547 --> 00:59:24.381
who agreed with great difficulty, she said,

00:59:24.381 --> 00:59:34.547
"I don't want to marry." It's funny. It is very funny that,

00:59:34.589 --> 00:59:37.089
the way our ego is working out. Because, you see,

00:59:37.089 --> 00:59:40.797
when we are looking at another person for marriage or anything,

00:59:40.839 --> 00:59:43.423
we are not thinking of Yogeshwara.

00:59:43.423 --> 00:59:46.048
We don't think that it is Yogeshwara,

00:59:46.089 --> 00:59:48.672
who will do everything for us, we are thinking,

00:59:48.714 --> 00:59:51.756
we have to do it. Alright, so we go ahead with this,

00:59:51.756 --> 00:59:58.256
that, and spoil our attention completely.

00:59:58.256 --> 01:00:03.089
""Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja."

01:00:03.089 --> 01:00:09.381
In this part of your decision, if you can leave it to God,

01:00:09.423 --> 01:00:17.631
it would be better. I tell you, if you can do that,

01:00:17.631 --> 01:00:21.797
you have crossed your ego half way through.

01:00:21.839 --> 01:00:27.215
Because at least 50% ego is used in this.

01:00:27.215 --> 01:00:30.048
In the West especially.

01:00:30.048 --> 01:00:33.173
In India this question doesn't arise much.

01:00:33.173 --> 01:00:38.505
Because the parents can't decide here, nobody can decide,

01:00:38.506 --> 01:00:42.756
you have to decide yourself. It's a big responsibility

01:00:42.756 --> 01:00:45.215
and a big thing for you.

01:00:45.256 --> 01:00:49.173
So 50% of your ego problem will be finished,

01:00:49.173 --> 01:00:56.964
I tell you, once you just give up this responsibility

01:00:57.006 --> 01:01:08.631
of choosing a bride or a bridegroom for yourself. Just forget it.

01:01:08.631 --> 01:01:15.340
Such a waste of energy, I tell you.

01:01:15.381 --> 01:01:22.006
When I see people, young people, doing all these things

01:01:22.048 --> 01:01:25.547
I wish they could understand the value of their lives,

01:01:25.547 --> 01:01:32.381
the esteem of their lives. Their Ishwara is Shri Krishna.

01:01:32.423 --> 01:01:43.340
He''s not Ishwara of everyone, only of yogis.

01:01:43.381 --> 01:01:45.256
Anybody else who tries to say

01:01:45.298 --> 01:01:49.547
"Hare Rama, Hare Krishna" will get throat cancer.

01:01:49.589 --> 01:01:55.131
Anybody who tries to call Him

01:01:55.173 --> 01:02:02.506
who is not a yogi gets a problem in the throat, you know.

01:02:02.506 --> 01:02:14.006
So He is only available to you, He is only your Ishwara.

01:02:14.048 --> 01:02:22.923
He manifests only for you. He is your own.

01:02:22.964 --> 01:02:28.631
He won't act for any Dick, Tom and Harry.

01:02:28.672 --> 01:02:30.589
Maybe you might be a prime minister,

01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:33.672
you might be a king or queen, it makes no difference to him.

01:02:33.714 --> 01:02:38.923
To him only a yogi, only a yogi can call him.

01:02:38.923 --> 01:02:43.089
Only a yogi can ask for his help.

01:02:43.089 --> 01:02:46.465
He is not bothered about anybody else.

01:02:46.505 --> 01:02:55.797
And if a yogi recommends, then only He can look after someone.

01:02:55.797 --> 01:02:59.465
Otherwise He will not bother about him.

01:02:59.505 --> 01:03:13.089
So He is actually your own king, who is always there,

01:03:13.131 --> 01:03:20.340
looking after you. When you call Him,

01:03:20.381 --> 01:03:27.881
He comes with all His powers to support you.

01:03:27.923 --> 01:03:35.173
But you have to be a yogi. If you are not a yogi,

01:03:35.215 --> 01:03:41.714
which is of course certified by Lord Jesus Christ,

01:03:41.756 --> 01:03:44.964
then Krishna has nothing to do with you.

01:03:45.006 --> 01:03:48.505
So before the entry to Shri Krishna,

01:03:48.505 --> 01:03:52.298
though He is not the one who is going to judge your innocence,

01:03:52.298 --> 01:03:59.672
in the door resides Lord Jesus Christ.

01:03:59.714 --> 01:04:02.964
When you get in, then it's all right.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:09.589
But to get in, also is difficult because He''s always throwing you out.

01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:18.756
Shri Krishna has said, that "You will be the ...",

01:04:18.797 --> 01:04:23.923
to Jesus, He said, "You will be the Adhara, the support of the universe."

01:04:23.964 --> 01:04:26.547
Means the innocence is your support, innocence.

01:04:26.589 --> 01:04:29.298
If that innocence is not established in you,

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:36.505
then Shri Krishna cannot help you. He is helpless.

01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:39.298
Because you don't become a yogi and

01:04:39.298 --> 01:04:44.173
so He''s not your Ishwara any more.

01:04:44.173 --> 01:04:47.505
Now one may say that, "Mother the Agnya chakra

01:04:47.505 --> 01:04:52.048
is here and He is here," Alright,

01:04:52.048 --> 01:04:59.340
but Agnya chakra when you cross, here he is.

01:04:59.381 --> 01:05:06.048
When, you cross your Agnya chakra,

01:05:06.089 --> 01:05:10.505
that means He is sitting there and the Virata is sitting here.

01:05:10.506 --> 01:05:17.756
So unless and until you pass your Agnya Chakra

01:05:17.797 --> 01:05:23.131
properly, you can't get to Virat.

01:05:23.131 --> 01:05:27.173
And Yogeshwara is the Virat.

01:05:27.215 --> 01:05:35.089
That is the aspect we have to worship, we have to worship!

01:05:35.089 --> 01:05:39.881
Worshipping doesn't mean that you become that person.

01:05:39.923 --> 01:05:42.797
You worship Me, you don't become Me.

01:05:42.797 --> 01:05:45.381
What do you do, when you worship?

01:05:45.423 --> 01:05:51.589
You surrender all that is not liked by Me,

01:05:51.631 --> 01:06:05.672
in the fire, in the water, outside. In the elements you throw them away.

01:06:05.714 --> 01:06:11.714
And you bring to Me your heart. That''s what it is, worshipping.

01:06:11.756 --> 01:06:15.256
In the same way we have to worship the aspect

01:06:15.298 --> 01:06:21.506
of Shri Krishna in me, which is Yogeshwara.

01:06:21.506 --> 01:06:24.714
I am Yogeshwara.

01:06:24.756 --> 01:06:28.131
Things do not come into My head at all,

01:06:28.173 --> 01:06:30.465
I don't see things like that.

01:06:30.505 --> 01:06:32.923
I don't know what is temptation is, what attraction is,

01:06:32.923 --> 01:06:37.298
I just don't understand. On the contrary

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:41.465
these things repel me, repel absolutely, I vomit.

01:06:41.505 --> 01:06:47.131
Even to hear these things, I don't want to open My ears,

01:06:47.131 --> 01:06:51.381
My ears become deaf. I can't hear these things.

01:06:51.423 --> 01:06:54.006
I can't understand any dirty jokes.

01:06:54.048 --> 01:06:57.256
I have no brains [for this]. My brains refuse to understand.

01:06:57.298 --> 01:07:06.881
I become a dull person, absolutely. Deaf and dumb.

01:07:06.923 --> 01:07:09.589
People have written books and books on these things,

01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:11.256
I don't know what they must be writing.

01:07:11.298 --> 01:07:14.215
What is there to write on this?

01:07:14.256 --> 01:07:21.714
So today we have to know that our personal life

01:07:21.756 --> 01:07:25.089
has to be extremely clean.

01:07:25.089 --> 01:07:27.714
We face ourselves every moment

01:07:27.714 --> 01:07:29.756
and find out within ourselves --

01:07:29.797 --> 01:07:33.256
are we really worshipping Yogeshwara within ourselves

01:07:33.256 --> 01:07:39.215
who resides within us? Let us develop that purity.

01:07:39.256 --> 01:07:45.131
Then innocence will be established in our eyes.

01:07:45.173 --> 01:07:49.465
We'll be innocent. The eyes will speak of innocence.

01:07:49.465 --> 01:07:53.298
What's the use of having eyes,

01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:56.964
which are all the time shifting,

01:07:56.964 --> 01:07:59.256
you don't know where they are going, wobbling eyes,

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.256
you see, like this, like this, like this.

01:08:01.256 --> 01:08:04.006
You can't trust these eyes at all.

01:08:04.048 --> 01:08:09.797
But the eyes, which are innocent,

01:08:09.839 --> 01:08:18.505
receive nothing they just give. They just give.

01:08:18.506 --> 01:08:24.006
Innocence is very penetrating, very purifying,

01:08:24.006 --> 01:08:32.215
very soothing and very beautiful.

01:08:32.215 --> 01:08:39.881
We have to become beautiful people.

01:08:39.881 --> 01:08:46.589
Today I said on these things

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:53.131
because I'm sometimes disturbed the way people

01:08:53.173 --> 01:08:59.006
don't understand that purity of sex life

01:08:59.048 --> 01:09:03.298
is so important to Sahaja Yoga, especially in the West.

01:09:03.298 --> 01:09:06.839
People don't understand.

01:09:06.881 --> 01:09:11.340
To Indians this lecture has no meaning, they will think,

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.839
"Why Mother is wasting Her energy so much?"

01:09:13.881 --> 01:09:16.381
Because they don't understand.

01:09:16.381 --> 01:09:22.173
But to Me it is very important here.

01:09:22.215 --> 01:09:31.006
Whatever I have seen and heard and see all around.

01:09:31.006 --> 01:09:37.756
I think today's message should be of Yogeshwara.

01:09:37.797 --> 01:09:42.131
Let us worship Yogeshwara with our heart.

01:09:42.173 --> 01:09:44.089
When you worship Me today,

01:09:44.131 --> 01:09:49.547
it should be the worship of Yogeshwara and nothing else.

01:09:49.547 --> 01:09:53.631
May God bless you.
