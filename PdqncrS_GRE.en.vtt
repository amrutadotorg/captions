00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:16.500
It’s such a great pleasure to be here in
Colombia; which was my great desire, long

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:28.579
time back that, somehow if I could come later
to this country, I may be able to start Sahaj

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:29.579
Yoga here.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:37.190
Because I did feel, at that time that there
are lots of seekers and very good people in

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.190
Colombia.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:01:03.930
They are the seekers of truth and want to
rise higher in their awareness.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:18.460
And as it was desired by me, it has worked
out.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:32.280
I’m very happy to be here among you people;
and we have people from, also, other countries

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:44.200
of South America which is a very great thing.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:53.470
We started working out in European countries,
which were developed countries we can say,

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:01.569
but I always had a very earnest desire to
come to the other side, that is the underdeveloped

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:09.250
countries, where there is culture.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:23.790
It has to spread to all the countries.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.680
No country should say that it did not come
to us, that we did not know the truth, that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:42.580
we missed the point.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:59.730
As you people are first founders and the foundation
stones of Sahaj Yoga you have to be very careful.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:12.560
As I have said, many a times, the knowledge
that we have from science and other things

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:25.420
is the knowledge of the tree, but Sahaj Yoga
is the knowledge of the roots.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:37.920
So, we have to become deeper personalities,
we have to see our own depths and our own

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:51.440
glories and our own beauties, and to enjoy
them.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:04:01.710
All that beauty we can have; plus you can
see that the human beings are part and parcel

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.720
of one personality.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:17.259
But we cannot do it by just lecturing or by
giving sermons.

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:35.340
But we have to prove it to them by their ascent,
that is, by giving them Self-realisation,

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:46.780
by the actualisation of the experience.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.850
In every way we have to tell them that the
truth cannot be found out by paying money

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.790
or making efforts or by sufferings.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:12.320
The truth resides within us and we have to
just reconcile to the idea that, so far, we

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:21.620
have not found it.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.790
Now the way you will handle them is very important.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.330
Because they come to my program, get Realisation.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:49.840
But when they come back then you have to handle
them very carefully and delicately.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:58.710
Also you must understand what is the pulse
of your country, what is the specialty of

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.580
your country, pulse of the country, the pulse, you see, it is the pulse.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:16.200
Now, for example, I find people here are very
sweet, very innocent very traditional, so

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:31.680
you have to approach them in that manner.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.630
But supposing they are from the intellectual
sort of areas or from over-industrialised

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.870
areas, then you have to approach them in that
way.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:07:00.960
So, first of all you must keep your vibrations
clear.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:15.930
Also you must know what you should do as to
become experts in vibrations.

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:22.530
You should be able to say, whether somebody
is catching this or that, or what you are

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:28.410
catching.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:38.260
But
you should not in any way tell them what others

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.630
are catching, let them find out themselves.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:57.550
As they will start growing in their own sensitivity,
they themselves can find out what’s wrong

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:00.080
with them.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:13.430
They themselves will tell you what is the
finger they are burning, where they are getting

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.650
the heat.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:21.199
They themselves will tell you.

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:24.800
Then you have to tell them that, “This is
the centre you are catching,” “This is

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.800
the problem."

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.800
If they ask you.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:36.529
This is how you should move with them.

00:08:36.529 --> 00:08:43.849
But in any case, if there is any problem,
anything, you can write to me directly.

00:08:43.849 --> 00:08:54.460
I am always available to anything that you
want to know.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:09:00.370
I hope today there will be many people who
will be coming to the programme.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:10.600
But the
follow-on has to be attended properly by all

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:25.460
of you, and you should be able to gently handle
them.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:34.440
And as you know that we do not have anything
like registration of names or anything.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:47.320
But better is to talk to them,to each one
of them: ask their names, what are they doing,

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:51.180
where they live.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.040
It’s much better.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:06.890
And if they want, they can leave their addresses
with you.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:12.990
For your pujas and all that you have to see
them if they are deep enough, then you can

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:14.510
call them for pujas.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:36.770
Also puja can be quite a shock to them because
they have never known all these things before.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:53.820
There are so many ways by which you can convince
them that this is the truth.

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:59.020
In any case, if you have any questions you
should ask me later on so I can tell you what

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:10.750
is to be the solution.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:15.230
So now let us have the puja and after that
I think most of the questions will be solved

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.230
also, automatically!

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.230
All right let us have, for washing, a little
warm water will be a good idea.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:18.230
If there is some warm water, little bit warm
water.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:19.230
Copper is a very auspicious metal for puja,
copper is, and you get such a lot of copper

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.230
here.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.230
You both can come for washing, you both, and
the little girl.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:22.230
Come along!

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.230
Three of you can wash.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.230
Come!

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.230
Come this side!

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.230
You be on this side, you be on this side,
and she can be in the centre.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.230
Come this side.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.230
Let him come this side.

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.230
Come in the centre.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.230
Now, push back your sleeves.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.230
May God bless!

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.230
Good!

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:33.230
Hmmm.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:34.230
Nice!

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:35.230
Now, you push back your sleeves a little;
yours also, sleeves, a little bit.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:36.230
And also his.

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.230
Yes come along!

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.230
You’ve got a coconut with you?

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.230
Yogi: Yes, Mother.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:40.230
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:41.230
Then what I would suggest [is] that, in this
one you put a coconut, because that’s how

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.230
we have the khumba, and some leaves.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.230
You put the khumba there eh?

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.230
It’s all right.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.230
Then if it is there it’s all right.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:46.230
One only [is needed].

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:47.230
I didn’t see it, so that’s what I was
wondering.

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:48.230
Keep it there, it’s all right, but some
leaves must be put with it, you see.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:49.230
Some leaves, some long leaves.

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.230
We could use these.

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:51.230
Yes, that’s good.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:52.230
That’s all.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.230
Few leaves.

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.230
So now, just round the coconut.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.230
You can bring that one here, that khumba.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:56.230
Then bring the whole lot.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.230
Yogi: We can put it on top of this?

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:58.230
Shri Mataji: It’s all right.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.230
It’s all right.

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:00.230
It’s a very good idea.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:01.230
Now around that place, yes a little bit.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:02.230
Good.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:03.230
This is symbolic, very symbolic.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.230
Yogi: The light is very beautiful.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.230
Shri Mataji: Very good, beautiful.

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:06.230
Just on top of my head!

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:07.230
Yes, so now.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:08.230
If you can pour water then, yes.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:09.230
You can pour it and they can wash and then
they can pour.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:10.230
All right.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.230
Yogi: Shri Ganesha’s mantras?

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:12.230
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.230
(Sahaj Yogis repeat Shri Ganesha’s mantra
three times.)

00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:14.230
Shri Mataji: I would say, if you have some
unmarried ladies.

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:15.230
All right.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.230
So what we can do is to remove this now.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:17.230
Get a towel.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:18.230
Hello, you can remove this and we can get
a towel just to [dry].

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:19.230
Lilia?

00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:20.230
You remove it because one person should be
in charge of mantras.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.230
You remove this.

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:22.230
Yes, yes.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:23.230
Good.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.230
May God bless!

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:25.230
(Sahaj Yogis recite Ganesh Atharva Sheersh)

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:26.230
Shri Mataji: Now we could have the Spanish
version if you have.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:27.230
Yogi: Yes, Mother.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.230
Shri Mataji: Should be more uniform.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.230
(Sahaj Yogis recite Ganesh Atharva Sheersh
in Spanish)

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.230
Shri Mataji: Also the centre where resides
the thing.

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:31.230
You see, you have to make the swastika on
top.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.230
But first of all this should be little bit
put uniformly.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:33.230
Now the thing is to put the…

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:34.230
Yogini: A little water is needed?

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:35.230
Should I put a little water?

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.230
Shri Mataji: Water?

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:37.230
Yes, please put.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.230
Some water is needed.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:39.230
You can sing song of, Ganesha’s song.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.230
One song.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:41.230
Sahaj Yogi: We know the English song, “Shri
Ganesha”

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:42.230
Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s all right.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.230
Make it more uniform

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.230
(Sahaj Yogis sing “Om bhur bhuva swaha”
song (English 1))

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:45.230
Beautiful.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.230
Now, so you have to start with the Devi’s
108 names now.

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:47.230
Sahaj Yogi: Should we sing them Shri Mataji?

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.230
Should we sing 108 names?

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:49.230
Shri Mataji: Yes, 108 names.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:50.230
(Sahaj Yogis sing “Tere Hi Guna Gate Hai”)

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.230
Shri Mataji: Any one, any one will do.

00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.230
Yes.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.230
Little bit properly.

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.230
Put it properly, put it properly.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:55.230
Yes, put it properly.

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.230
Push it on the sides.

00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:57.230
It will be all in the picture you see.

00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.230
They would like to see my feet when I came
to Colombia.

00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:59.230
Yes, good.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:00.230
All right.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:01.230
Yes you can put it on the side.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:02.230
That top one doesn’t look so nice.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:03.230
I think that one looks better I think.

00:13:03.230 --> 00:13:04.230
Yes, that’s better.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:05.230
Never so many flowers on my feet!

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:06.230
First time!

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:07.230
May God bless you all!

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.230
Put it there, somewhere.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.230
All right.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.230
Let everybody put it now.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.230
Now the ladies have to give me bangles.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:12.230
All right?

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:13.230
It’s beautiful.

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:14.230
May God bless you!

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.230
You may close the door.

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:16.230
I think it’s rather cold.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:17.230
Now, ladies have to give me bangles

00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:18.230
Sahaj Yogini: Married Ladies?

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:19.230
Shri Mataji: Married yes.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.230
Yogini: Two by two?

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.230
Shri Mataji: Two each.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.230
I mean I think they can give in four.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:23.230
Twenty one there are.

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.230
Eleven on one side and ten on the other.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:25.230
Now if you can give me the plate, the silver
plate, there’s a double plate there, under

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.230
the kumkum.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:27.230
Wonderful puja, wonderful.

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.230
You made cake?

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.230
Today is your new year’s day so happy new
year to you and I’m told that, also, it

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:30.230
is regarded as a New Year’s day as well
as your Independence Day?

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.238
May all of you have your real freedom.
