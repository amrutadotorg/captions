00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:50,577
Today we are celebrating the great event

2
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:55,847
of the resurrection of Christ.

3
00:00:58,222 --> 00:01:04,643
On the same pattern is your resurrection;

4
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:15,229
that you have risen to the new life of Divine love.

5
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:42,284
You were all in the knowledge that
there’s something higher has to happen to you;

6
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:53,651
that you are to be born again, but nobody knew how it works.

7
00:01:54,581 --> 00:02:04,710
The subtle side of your being was never told to you.

8
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:10,355
The saints only talked as to how you should behave.

9
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:20,866
They only said how you should try to keep a very pure life,

10
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:30,914
sincere life, but they didn't tell you how it will work out.

11
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:39,826
Of course people knew in India about it,

12
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:46,048
very few of them, very, very few of them,

13
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:55,605
but now it's a worldwide knowledge through you people.

14
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:10,213
Now while your Kundalini rises,
She is your Mother, She is your individual Mother,

15
00:03:10,498 --> 00:03:15,671
 and She gives you the second birth.

16
00:03:16,412 --> 00:03:30,382
That's how you get connected to the Divine paradise.

17
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:37,513
All this, if it is told without realization has no meaning,

18
00:03:37,665 --> 00:03:44,344
but people are given great ideas about it

19
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:56,916
and also were promised that one day your resurrection will come.

20
00:03:57,784 --> 00:04:01,374
It is the greatest happening for you,

21
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:07,533
 is the greatest event of your life,

22
00:04:08,107 --> 00:04:16,697
and one must consider it’s very fortunate
that you have been able to achieve it.

23
00:04:17,728 --> 00:04:25,038
All this because also because you desired for it.

24
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:40,117
In many of your lives
you have been desiring for the heavenly paradise.

25
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:52,098
People have been going round in the
hills and dales seeking; doing all kinds of things.

26
00:04:52,716 --> 00:04:56,726
That's already done by you.

27
00:04:56,916 --> 00:05:03,818
You don't have to give up anything, no need to give up anything.

28
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:09,996
This wrong idea; I should say an untimely idea.

29
00:05:11,523 --> 00:05:20,467
This is the time when you have to get your
Sahaja resurrection, spontaneous resurrection.

30
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,500
You don't have to do anything about it,

31
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:35,256
 it's just so simple as that; has worked out so well.

32
00:05:35,851 --> 00:05:44,725
I was really very much overjoyed to see that so many people,

33
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:50,333
specially Muslims, about whom I have been so much worried

34
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:53,949
 that how can you save these people?

35
00:05:54,465 --> 00:06:01,734
They are so much lost in the mess of wrong thinking.

36
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:13,383
One has to understand that this Koran was written

37
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:18,930
forty years after the death of Mohammed Sahib.

38
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:24,207
So maybe that there might be some words which are being,

39
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:36,279
 just being shifted maybe, 
and the meaning might be little bit ambiguous.

40
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:48,304
Also there was another book called Sunna came out about the same time

41
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:56,050
 and was managed by a person who was not such a great

42
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,868
soul I should say, because he was not a realized soul.

43
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:10,395
I can't understand how can you religiously understand a poet same

44
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:17,583
and in the poetry whatever is written, 
how can you interpret it correctly?

45
00:07:17,829 --> 00:07:24,192
This is the reason why I, I am a poet also;

46
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:29,166
 I could have written a poetry about it but I said no.

47
00:07:29,309 --> 00:07:37,376
Poetry can twist, can be twisted and also people can misuse it.

48
00:07:37,852 --> 00:07:40,571
That’s the problem with the poetry is.

49
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:43,628
In India we had the same problem.

50
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:48,540
For example, Kabira wrote such beautiful poetry

51
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,397
 and the way they interpreted was so nonsensical

52
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:59,384
and so much different from the spirit of Kabira's songs.

53
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:05,331
About everything they can twist the words

54
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:14,354
 according to their own need,
I found out if I wrote poetry about Divinity.

55
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:19,319
This exactly what has happened.

56
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:27,145
In all the religions I’ve seen, 
when it comes to poetry people can twist it.

57
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:41,413
Also, like in Bible, it was so much accepted

58
00:08:41,592 --> 00:08:52,323
that Paul is the one who is going to organize 
the publication about Christ,

59
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:58,670
 and he didn't want to write also about resurrection;

60
00:08:58,865 --> 00:09:03,245
he didn't want to write about the Immaculate Conception.

61
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:07,269
All these things were in his mind

62
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:13,880
and so Thomas had to run away to India
 and John refused to write anything.

63
00:09:15,425 --> 00:09:18,629
Because all such people take charge.

64
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:20,734
They become in charge.

65
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:28,052
They think they are responsible for it, 
while they are not at all capable.

66
00:09:28,177 --> 00:09:31,967
They don't have the right to do it.

67
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:38,357
As a result of that, Christianity took a very

68
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:44,476
 wrong attitude towards the inner growth of human being.

69
00:09:46,555 --> 00:09:55,610
It’s, you see the result of that - today when you see what's happening

70
00:09:56,143 --> 00:09:59,358
with the Catholic Church, you are amazed.

71
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:05,014
How can such an organization be a religious organization,

72
00:10:05,141 --> 00:10:09,537
where all kinds of nonsensical things are going on?

73
00:10:10,204 --> 00:10:16,955
I was also born in a Christian family and 
I was shocked the way they interpreted

74
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:22,811
Christ's life and the way talked about it with great authority.

75
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:25,809
Books and books were written.

76
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,619
They give big, big sermons.

77
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:32,632
I thought there's no truth in it what they are talking;

78
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:35,698
even My father felt the same way.

79
00:10:36,825 --> 00:10:42,809
Because all these books came much after,

80
00:10:43,222 --> 00:10:46,090
the authors of these books.

81
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:52,878
Secondly, those who tried to write it were not authorized to do that.

82
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:55,351
They were not spiritual people.

83
00:10:55,751 --> 00:11:02,456
They all wanted to have power; they wanted to have power in religion.

84
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:11,362
The power in religion is inside, and that should be awakened.

85
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:18,443
I must say thanks to the Sufis of this country and other countries

86
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:26,969
 that people still think that there is something
beyond all these words and talks and books.

87
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:37,230
This is something, such a blessing that we have 
that in every country we had someone

88
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:41,063
who talked about reality, about the truth;

89
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:48,441
 though they were condemned, they were tortured,
and so many of them were killed.

90
00:11:49,529 --> 00:12:01,835
This is happening even today; I find that
people don't want to listen to reality, to the truth.

91
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:06,033
But I was so happy yesterday, really overjoyed,

92
00:12:06,168 --> 00:12:14,129
 to see that even the people who were Muslims, were Islamic,

93
00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:26,576
have now coming together, understanding that
 they have a higher life than these rituals of everyday.

94
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:36,029
All these ritualistic life that they have led, 
the way they have worked so hard,

95
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:46,280
They these forty days starvation, going for Hajj -

96
00:12:46,542 --> 00:12:52,140
doing all kinds of things - but there was no unity among themselves.

97
00:12:52,274 --> 00:12:55,756
Even among themselves there was no unity,

98
00:12:55,817 --> 00:13:03,510
 and some places I was surprised that they were killing each other.

99
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,562
How can that be?

100
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:14,566
Because these so called practices did not make them collective.

101
00:13:14,747 --> 00:13:16,999
They were not collective.

102
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:21,905
They were all separate identities, separate sects,

103
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:29,416
guided by absolutely ignorant people.

104
00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:38,264
So we have to really celebrate the unity of these people,

105
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,938
 the collective nature of these people, who were lost to the truth.

106
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:51,107
They had no idea as to what truth is,

107
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:59,440
but still a seeker can never find consolation

108
00:13:59,527 --> 00:14:02,622
with whatever exists.

109
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:10,191
He’s seeking; he’s seeking and seeking till he finds the truth.

110
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:14,730
But also there are many seekers who lose their way.

111
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,363
In seeking they get lost.

112
00:14:18,492 --> 00:14:25,053
It's very difficult to convince them that you have lost your way.

113
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:29,275
But they should see from their own lives.

114
00:14:29,394 --> 00:14:36,532
They should see from their own attainment.

115
00:14:36,967 --> 00:14:40,522
What have they achieved?

116
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:44,312
Have they got any experience?

117
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:54,526
To be convinced of what you have got, you must try to verify it.

118
00:14:55,417 --> 00:15:03,100
You can verify on people; you can verify on yourself.

119
00:15:03,687 --> 00:15:11,219
Whatever you are, you know on your fingertips as they say.

120
00:15:11,692 --> 00:15:15,570
Now it’s said in the Koran,

121
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:19,541
that at the time of your Kiyama – means resurrection time –

122
00:15:19,603 --> 00:15:24,092
 they’re two things Kiyamat and Kiyama – two things –

123
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:27,050
also many people don’t understand the difference.

124
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:31,450
One is when the resurrection time comes,

125
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:36,672
 and the another is when your destruction comes in.

126
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:43,072
For the resurrection of human being is the Kiyama,

127
00:15:43,223 --> 00:15:48,423
 in which it’s said that your hands will speak;

128
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:55,235
that you should feel the vibrations on your fingertips.

129
00:15:55,381 --> 00:16:08,041
I would say those who are really Muslims, 
who are surrendered, and those who have been

130
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:22,756
selected to be higher people belonging to 
the God's realm must have hands that can speak;

131
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:25,806
otherwise they are not Muslims.

132
00:16:26,045 --> 00:16:28,219
I would not call them Muslims.

133
00:16:28,393 --> 00:16:32,881
They may be human beings, but not Muslims.

134
00:16:33,636 --> 00:16:38,327
So it's compulsory that for every Muslim,

135
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:44,476
he thinks he’s a Muslim, he should have vibrations in his hands.

136
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,215
He should feel the vibration.

137
00:16:47,320 --> 00:17:01,902
His hands must speak at the time of resurrection,
 which is the Kiyama, Kiyama - not Kiyamat.

138
00:17:02,241 --> 00:17:07,251
These two words are confused in the minds of the people.

139
00:17:07,371 --> 00:17:16,954
So those people who can verify about 
their achievements themselves

140
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:20,752
through their vibrations on their hands,

141
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:27,196
and also about others through their fingertips are the Muslims;

142
00:17:27,469 --> 00:17:33,648
 according to Koran, but nobody has told them this.

143
00:17:34,104 --> 00:17:35,529
They don't know.

144
00:17:35,757 --> 00:17:38,959
To them it’s all right if you go to Mecca

145
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:43,010
and come back from there; you become a Hajji, finished.

146
00:17:43,478 --> 00:17:48,094
There’s another question one should ask which is very important -

147
00:17:48,146 --> 00:17:55,428
that why Mohammed Sahib was so much against stone worshipping,

148
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:00,331
 clearly, why did He ask people to go round

149
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,479
that black square stone?

150
00:18:05,634 --> 00:18:07,914
What was the purpose of that?

151
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,948
Why was that stone so important?

152
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:22,505
If you ask this question to any so called Muslim 
he’ll say that was the order,

153
00:18:22,796 --> 00:18:27,376
 but you can ask the question after all why?

154
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,613
That's also just a stone.

155
00:18:29,638 --> 00:18:39,220
So why did, why did Mohammed Sahib ask 
that you should go round that stone?

156
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:46,325
So many statues were there made of stone

157
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:53,532
 and people started worshipping all kinds of statues 
as they do in India also.

158
00:18:53,939 --> 00:18:57,816
But this stone was a Swayambhu,

159
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:04,104
and is mentioned in the Indian scriptures 
that there is Meccashwar Shiva.

160
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:11,260
We have Shivas everywhere in India; there are twelve Jyotirlingas.

161
00:19:11,457 --> 00:19:17,177
Now if I tell you, you need not believe Me, 
but you can go and verify on your vibrations

162
00:19:17,202 --> 00:19:22,242
if it is a Shiva or not; same with this black stone.

163
00:19:22,535 --> 00:19:27,828
So Mohammed Sahib found out that this is a Meccashwar Shiva

164
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:39,393
and so the people have to go round to achieve Shiva's blessings, 
but it became a ritual.

165
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:48,100
The whole thing became like a ritual 
and nobody could go further from that ritual.

166
00:19:48,617 --> 00:19:51,177
Same thing with the Christianity.

167
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:58,353
Why today is a day they are talking so big
 about repentance

168
00:19:58,518 --> 00:20:06,265
 and about feeling guilty about what 
they have done, but why did they do it?

169
00:20:06,811 --> 00:20:17,317
They are supposed to be in charge of goodness,
 of virtues - so why did they do it?

170
00:20:17,538 --> 00:20:24,234
Why did they do wrong things and now asking forgiveness from God?

171
00:20:24,387 --> 00:20:28,963
Because they were not realized souls.

172
00:20:29,585 --> 00:20:32,005
They’re not Sahaja Yogis.

173
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:37,194
If the Sahaja Yogis try to do something wrong

174
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,286
then they know that they are doing wrong on their fingertips,

175
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:45,671
 or we can ask them to get out of Sahaja Yoga,

176
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:49,977
but that seems to be the worst punishment for Sahaja Yogis.

177
00:20:50,568 --> 00:20:54,681
If I tell them to get out of Sahaja Yoga, they don't like it.

178
00:20:55,351 --> 00:20:56,849
Why?

179
00:20:56,874 --> 00:21:05,287
Because they feel we are separated from reality.

180
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:12,828
All the blessings of the reality are lost to them; 
they think that way.

181
00:21:17,032 --> 00:21:24,372
The punishment is nothing, 
because we just ask you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

182
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:30,758
To look at it’s nothing, but Sahaja Yoga is complete freedom.

183
00:21:31,321 --> 00:21:35,128
Sahaja Yoga is complete blessing.

184
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:40,101
Sahaja Yoga is complete peace and joy.

185
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:47,293
Surprisingly, if you read Koran you’ll be amazed that Mohammed Sahib

186
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:53,879
 wanted to bring peace, but it's not so.

187
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:59,554
I met one man from Kashmir.

188
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:03,239
He said that, “Where is the peace?

189
00:22:04,326 --> 00:22:07,695
They are all fighting, fighting; we want peace.”

190
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:13,025
But surprisingly, he said, “In India we find there’s peace.

191
00:22:13,331 --> 00:22:18,453
But this Kashmir is a mad place 
where everybody is all the time challenged

192
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:23,392
and everything attacked - under the name of Islam itself.”

193
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:27,677
So I said, it's not Islam.

194
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:30,702
Islam means surrender.

195
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:34,340
And he said, “If you surrender they‘ll kill you.

196
00:22:34,578 --> 00:22:38,425
We have no protection.”

197
00:22:39,085 --> 00:22:42,883
It's very surprising, very, very surprising,

198
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:47,066
 how now the Muslims themselves are realizing

199
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,910
that this cannot be Divine life.
This cannot be Divine life,

200
00:22:53,299 --> 00:23:00,910
because in Divine life people are just the same with each other.

201
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:04,567
You see we had Sufis all over the world.

202
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,676
I have read them.

203
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:16,728
I have read the Sufis of Turkey and also other places.

204
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:22,621
Even in India we had Sufis, though 
they don't call themselves Sufis so much.

205
00:23:23,224 --> 00:23:31,132
Sufi means, I don't know what ever you may think it, 
but according to Indian understanding

206
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:36,407
Sufi means 'saaf' and 'saaf' means clean, means pure.

207
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:39,787
Those who are pure people are Sufis.

208
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:50,436
In the purity they see nothing 
but Divine grace, Divine love, Divine peace.

209
00:23:50,578 --> 00:23:55,361
They talked of peace only; they could not talk of war.

210
00:23:55,609 --> 00:24:05,409
Anybody who talks of war cannot be a person who 
has got any right to do that.

211
00:24:07,718 --> 00:24:12,812
War is absolutely like madness.

212
00:24:13,055 --> 00:24:15,934
Even animals won't fight like that.

213
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:22,290
We are even worse than animals when 
we think of war and killing each other.

214
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:29,558
This should not be done and it has to be stopped completely.

215
00:24:29,754 --> 00:24:39,949
Nobody has right to kill anybody unless and until he is attacked.

216
00:24:41,444 --> 00:24:50,699
So what we hear about our resurrection 
is this - that we are above so many things.

217
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:56,856
We have lost all those destructive qualities.

218
00:24:56,997 --> 00:25:06,572
As in Sanskrit they call it we have six enemies –
 kama, kroda, mada, mathsarya, loba moha.

219
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:10,392
Kama means sexual perversion.

220
00:25:10,595 --> 00:25:12,968
Kroda means anger.

221
00:25:13,576 --> 00:25:16,490
Moha means attraction.

222
00:25:16,736 --> 00:25:19,350
Mada means the pride.

223
00:25:19,699 --> 00:25:24,331
Mathsarya means jealously.

224
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:36,024
All these six things, sixth one is the greed,

225
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:45,500
all these six things that we had in our mind - out of 
our ignorance, out of our upbringing,

226
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:49,936
out of our reading, whatever it is,

227
00:25:50,055 --> 00:25:55,880
whatever we had developed, we were having - just drops out.

228
00:25:57,002 --> 00:26:03,501
When the Kundalini rises and you become one with the Divine,

229
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:07,541
then you are on sound grounds.

230
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,856
You realize that you have found the truth

231
00:26:12,062 --> 00:26:17,763
and you no more can enjoy all these destructive habits.

232
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:20,329
They just drop out.

233
00:26:20,727 --> 00:26:29,637
So you go into a new realm of Divine construction within you.

234
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:34,329
This is the real resurrection of human beings.

235
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:43,387
Now, you know that certain subtle things 
still remain despite the fact

236
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:50,363
that people try to destroy the books, to spoil the meaning of things.

237
00:26:50,514 --> 00:26:55,154
Despite that, subtle things remain there.

238
00:26:55,711 --> 00:27:04,246
For example we offer eggs during Easter.

239
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,132
What's the meaning of offering eggs?

240
00:27:09,373 --> 00:27:11,934
Why should we offer an egg?

241
00:27:12,262 --> 00:27:20,807
First of all we offer egg because 
the egg can go into a transformation.

242
00:27:21,274 --> 00:27:25,132
It can become a small chick;

243
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:31,208
it can be born again. 
It’s the egg has the capacity to be born again.

244
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:41,222
So when you get this egg as a symbol of Easter it means -

245
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:48,737
you can become a different person, a reformed person

246
00:27:48,824 --> 00:27:54,519
and a great spiritual person. 
You can become; it means that.

247
00:27:54,574 --> 00:27:56,839
Why do we give eggs?

248
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,902
People don't know.

249
00:27:59,053 --> 00:28:01,073
I asked so many people.

250
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:06,047
I asked even some priests who think
they are great authorities of Christianity.

251
00:28:06,294 --> 00:28:10,379
They didn't know why they give eggs.

252
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:22,604
Secondly, if you read the story about 
the birth of Shri Ganesh

253
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:30,535
and then you proceed on, you’ll be surprised is written down 
that it was called as Brahmand -

254
00:28:30,814 --> 00:28:38,860
means the egg of the Brahma that came into existence,

255
00:28:39,226 --> 00:28:47,141
and half of it became the Mahavishnu means the Christ,

256
00:28:47,244 --> 00:28:53,664
 and half of it remained as Shri Ganesh.

257
00:28:54,005 --> 00:29:03,824
And then it is said that then when Mahavishnu 
came out, He started crying for His Father.

258
00:29:04,246 --> 00:29:09,357
Just think of it, He was asking for His Father.

259
00:29:09,563 --> 00:29:16,306
Now if you see Christ, He always uses these two fingers.

260
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,537
No other Incarnation has used these two fingers.

261
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:28,920
This means you know this is the Vishuddhi and this is the Nabhi.

262
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:39,954
That means He’s talking of His Father who was Nabhi King.

263
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:43,467
Who's that? You know that very well is the Vishnu,

264
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:49,445
 and His incarnation as Shri Krishna.

265
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:55,612
So what He’s indicating is this, that - they are My Father.

266
00:29:55,803 --> 00:29:58,022
How clearly He does that.

267
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:04,460
Why not have some other mudras, 
other style of holding the fingers?

268
00:30:04,578 --> 00:30:09,251
But He hold always these two fingers, meaning -

269
00:30:09,331 --> 00:30:15,297
My Father the one who was Vishnu and who was Shri Krishna.

270
00:30:16,916 --> 00:30:29,279
And then in the lives of Shri Krishna 
they say, “Mahavishnu will be Your Son.”

271
00:30:29,483 --> 00:30:35,450
All these things are not put together as
 I am telling you; separately,

272
00:30:35,532 --> 00:30:43,924
but if you have proper understanding 
you can understand the connection between the two -

273
00:30:44,043 --> 00:30:55,236
 that Christ was the son of Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna

274
00:30:55,696 --> 00:31:04,806
 and that was blessed that
 “You will be the support of the whole universe.”

275
00:31:04,961 --> 00:31:08,810
The support, the adhar of the whole universe, He said it clearly.

276
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:19,061
It is said so that “You will be supporting the whole universe.”

277
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:26,447
Now the one half is Shri Ganesh who, is the support in a way;

278
00:31:26,542 --> 00:31:31,712
it supports the Kundalini, it looks after the Kundalini,

279
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:39,401
 it looks after the chastity of the Mother -

280
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:48,565
and the another one which is expressed is Jesus Christ,

281
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:54,549
who is the support of the whole universe.

282
00:31:55,103 --> 00:32:02,084
So naturally it has to be the moral basis

283
00:32:02,307 --> 00:32:09,055
as He is a part and parcel of Shri Ganesha,

284
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:12,751
it's the moral basis of human beings.

285
00:32:12,841 --> 00:32:18,811
On the moral basis only you will be supported;

286
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,173
not all other nonsense that they have,

287
00:32:22,348 --> 00:32:31,030
but a moral basis, and which is missing 
in the lives of Christianity.

288
00:32:31,254 --> 00:32:36,982
Everything is allowed, very surprising.

289
00:32:37,316 --> 00:32:45,730
You can do whatever you like as long as 
you don't take a divorce in the Catholic Church.

290
00:32:46,206 --> 00:32:55,714
And also in the other Church which you can call 
non-Catholic Churches, there are many,

291
00:32:56,035 --> 00:33:06,916
even if you are married, you can do whatever you like.

292
00:33:07,274 --> 00:33:12,989
Even the Vatican I was told has all these problems.

293
00:33:13,736 --> 00:33:20,626
How can that be if you are the people who think you are baptized?

294
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:26,011
I mean there's a big celebration of baptism by these priests.

295
00:33:26,317 --> 00:33:31,074
Then where is the Sahasrara and where is the Kundalini

296
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:34,195
and how do you have your second birth?

297
00:33:34,663 --> 00:33:39,548
There's no second birth, just some priest puts his hand on your head.

298
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:44,525
Actually it makes a problem for realized souls,

299
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:49,338
 to put hand of the priest who are not realized souls,

300
00:33:49,711 --> 00:33:53,045
and that creates a problem for children.

301
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,996
I have seen many children they start crying loudly

302
00:33:57,108 --> 00:34:01,206
when they are being blessed by these priests,

303
00:34:02,015 --> 00:34:05,973
because they are realized souls and the priests are not.

304
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,500
It's very interesting.

305
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:12,854
But they say, “After all you see it's the priests that are bad,

306
00:34:12,898 --> 00:34:17,615
but not Christ.” But how are they related to each other?

307
00:34:17,852 --> 00:34:22,327
Christ stood for morality.

308
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:32,047
And about Him also in these modern times 
they are saying all kinds of filthy things.

309
00:34:32,288 --> 00:34:41,932
They cannot understand a character 
which is moral; to this extent we have gone.

310
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,621
Morality is out of question.

311
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:54,857
You do whatever you like; as long as 
you go to church and confess, you’re all right.

312
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:01,358
These are the absurdities of modern religions.

313
00:35:01,561 --> 00:35:09,836
Every religion has problems and the worst  I feel, 
when you have

314
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,043
the support of the world as your leader -

315
00:35:14,163 --> 00:35:21,789
how can you allow people to have such a immoral life?

316
00:35:24,287 --> 00:35:33,756
Immorality how can you tolerate when you follow the example of Christ?

317
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,762
Out of question!

318
00:35:38,113 --> 00:35:42,994
He is the embodiment of morality.

319
00:35:43,138 --> 00:35:51,183
He is Shri Ganesh and how can you allow people

320
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:56,160
 to come to churches, to the temples,

321
00:35:56,584 --> 00:36:02,084
and allow them to have immoral life?

322
00:36:02,505 --> 00:36:07,174
What is the atonement for such people?

323
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:19,329
The basis of Christ's life, the whole being 
of Christ is morality; to establish purity.

324
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:28,678
Now, it was Shri Ganesha who was created first

325
00:36:28,868 --> 00:36:36,967
by the Adishakti, because She wanted purity around.

326
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,369
She wanted human beings to enjoy their purity

327
00:36:45,448 --> 00:36:55,029
and their personality which was emitting light to others.

328
00:36:55,560 --> 00:37:01,900
If there is impurity say for example on a glass

329
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:09,207
and if you use that glass on top of the light, 
how can the light pass out?

330
00:37:09,865 --> 00:37:17,830
The impure life cannot, cannot give light to others,

331
00:37:17,885 --> 00:37:21,785
 and cannot show your inner light also.

332
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:30,165
Both things are absolutely true about impurities.

333
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:35,016
But people say that we have to accept

334
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:40,159
because if you have to have more people for your religion

335
00:37:40,233 --> 00:37:46,635
you should accept many things, and one of them is impurity.

336
00:37:49,233 --> 00:37:51,571
And just think of it.

337
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:56,469
Now at the Agnya where Christ resides,

338
00:37:56,739 --> 00:38:02,580
if your eyes are impure, full of lust and greed,

339
00:38:03,351 --> 00:38:11,442
then you are against Christ; you are an antichrist.

340
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:20,459
If your eyes are clean and pure,

341
00:38:20,783 --> 00:38:30,085
 then only you can enjoy love of God, otherwise you cannot.

342
00:38:31,128 --> 00:38:38,550
And also the love of another Sahaja Yogi or Yogini you can only enjoy

343
00:38:38,633 --> 00:38:43,426
 in completeness if your eyes are clean.

344
00:38:43,513 --> 00:38:45,929
Just imagine.

345
00:38:46,539 --> 00:38:56,230
But if you have roving eyes and all sorts of things, I don't know

346
00:38:56,588 --> 00:39:01,217
 how can you call yourself Christians? You cannot.

347
00:39:02,172 --> 00:39:06,453
Whatever certificate you may carry, but you are not,

348
00:39:06,622 --> 00:39:13,991
 because those who are following Christ 
have to have absolutely a moral life.

349
00:39:14,515 --> 00:39:22,521
That's a compulsion of the inner being on you -

350
00:39:22,721 --> 00:39:28,558
that you enjoy your morality

351
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:36,300
 and you enjoy above all your clean eyes.

352
00:39:37,643 --> 00:39:48,276
This is what I have come to know about the Western life
 that the eyes are not clean.

353
00:39:48,411 --> 00:39:53,315
They’ll go to the church and their eyes will be moving here and there.

354
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:55,737
How can that be?

355
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:58,178
How can you do that?

356
00:39:58,203 --> 00:40:05,184
If you think Christ is the one who was resurrected 
and you are to be resurrected,

357
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:11,568
first of all see that you have pure love in your eyes.

358
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:20,012
Now pure love is not relative, cannot be contaminated,

359
00:40:20,345 --> 00:40:25,551
 cannot have lust and greed in them.

360
00:40:27,126 --> 00:40:32,727
These two things have to drop out from your mind completely.

361
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:42,783
These are the days of people having greed, lots of greed they have.

362
00:40:45,258 --> 00:40:48,961
I just don't know what sort of things they have because

363
00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:53,307
 I haven't studied so much the immorality of human being.

364
00:40:54,169 --> 00:40:58,715
Whatever I see are beautiful people like you.

365
00:40:59,094 --> 00:41:06,875
But when I try to understand the so-called Western culture

366
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:12,634
I am surprised that even if they want to make a life for someone -

367
00:41:12,896 --> 00:41:18,285
 like “The Life of Shakespeare” I saw, 
who was according to Me

368
00:41:18,484 --> 00:41:26,650
was Avadhoota; means a person who has gone beyond all human

369
00:41:26,941 --> 00:41:34,908
destructive habits, Avadhoot is a very high quality yogi -

370
00:41:35,122 --> 00:41:41,653
and they show him as a stupid man running after a woman.

371
00:41:41,995 --> 00:41:53,815
They cannot conceive of human beings 
who could be morally perfect, who will have moral sense.

372
00:41:53,886 --> 00:42:02,554
They cannot conceive, because those 
who do this kind of thing are not realized soul.

373
00:42:02,783 --> 00:42:05,144
They are not Sahaja Yogis.

374
00:42:05,247 --> 00:42:10,944
So the conception about morality doesn't come into their head.

375
00:42:11,103 --> 00:42:14,121
They think as we are like that, the others are.

376
00:42:14,174 --> 00:42:18,805
Actually mostly they do it to justify themselves.

377
00:42:18,972 --> 00:42:30,492
So ugly and so horrifying is the depiction 
of the character of such great people

378
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:39,350
who talk such great things, shows that human beings 
are really degraded in their value system.

379
00:42:39,483 --> 00:42:47,471
They cannot conceive of somebody who is an ideal personality.

380
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:56,410
They think by saying so they are talking of something beyond reality.

381
00:42:56,465 --> 00:42:59,430
They don't know reality.

382
00:43:00,937 --> 00:43:04,858
Yesterday’s Sufi thing, I was very impressed

383
00:43:04,883 --> 00:43:08,202
when they said about the four stages that you have.

384
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:14,069
And out of that the Haakikat - means the reality,

385
00:43:14,371 --> 00:43:18,926
you have to get into the reality.

386
00:43:19,777 --> 00:43:21,979
Reality is what?

387
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,472
It’s not a perception.

388
00:43:25,655 --> 00:43:31,201
It's not seeing something, but it’s being something.

389
00:43:33,742 --> 00:43:40,793
If you start seeing, you might see something 
white, red, yellow but you are not that.

390
00:43:41,006 --> 00:43:50,050
When you are, you are the reality, 
then you emit reality,

391
00:43:50,367 --> 00:43:56,235
you see reality, you enjoy reality, you live in reality.

392
00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:01,521
This is real life and you don't indulge into

393
00:44:01,585 --> 00:44:08,866
something which is unreal, imaginary or below dignity.

394
00:44:08,891 --> 00:44:10,437
No you don't do it.

395
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:15,645
You are the reality, is the Haakikat, as they say.

396
00:44:15,721 --> 00:44:22,178
You are the reality and you are emitting reality

397
00:44:22,234 --> 00:44:29,644
 in your behavior, in your talks, in your lives, in everything.

398
00:44:32,223 --> 00:44:41,913
All this brings forth the greatest force of spirituality.

399
00:44:44,792 --> 00:44:53,217
Whatever is falsehood, whatever is wrong, whatever is destructive,

400
00:44:53,749 --> 00:44:59,993
 will run away from a man who stands in reality; is automatic.

401
00:45:02,311 --> 00:45:07,212
It is absolutely part and parcel

402
00:45:07,418 --> 00:45:12,724
of the same personality who is supposed to be a realized soul.

403
00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:18,888
So the resurrection has taken place no doubt - all right.

404
00:45:19,141 --> 00:45:21,711
Your hands are speaking - all right.

405
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:33,615
I don't want to give you any command or
any kind of a fixed road that you have to follow.

406
00:45:33,936 --> 00:45:38,186
Now you are free, because you have the light.

407
00:45:38,288 --> 00:45:41,271
When you have the light why should I tell you which way to go?

408
00:45:41,296 --> 00:45:50,286
You know yourself that you have the light, 
so you follow yourself in a way

409
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:55,734
 that is an enlightened path, with your own light.

410
00:45:55,861 --> 00:45:59,891
Don’t somebody has to tell you 
hat don't do this, don't do, nothing of the kind.

411
00:46:00,074 --> 00:46:05,340
You want just do it, if something wrong
 you will not do; if you are doing it

412
00:46:05,374 --> 00:46:11,409
then know that you have to still rise above all this thing.

413
00:46:12,012 --> 00:46:18,003
You are the Nabhis that are described in the Koran.

414
00:46:18,243 --> 00:46:23,574
You are the ones who are going to resurrect the whole world.

415
00:46:23,733 --> 00:46:31,066
You are the ones who are going to help the downtrodden people

416
00:46:31,202 --> 00:46:36,712
into the filth of immorality. Your life should show.

417
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:45,923
Look at these few of these people who were Sufis,

418
00:46:46,114 --> 00:46:53,342
who were very clean people, how have they been able to channelize

419
00:46:53,699 --> 00:46:56,900
 the other people into a better life?

420
00:46:57,695 --> 00:47:00,110
That is what you are.

421
00:47:00,273 --> 00:47:05,768
You have to channelize their lives; that's your job.

422
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:13,650
Don't think about what is happening, 
how the people are stupid, immoral, forget it.

423
00:47:13,905 --> 00:47:16,715
What you have to know what you are.

424
00:47:16,803 --> 00:47:24,324
You have to be aware of yourself 
and of your responsibility as being the purest of pure.

425
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:29,350
As my name is indicates, you are My children,

426
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:35,266
and that indicates the children of Nirmal, means purity.

427
00:47:35,501 --> 00:47:41,261
Purity is the basis of your existence.

428
00:47:42,117 --> 00:47:48,250
You should try to see where, what you were, in which part.

429
00:47:48,522 --> 00:47:54,151
There’s no mistake in appreciating the art,

430
00:47:54,310 --> 00:48:00,730
appreciating all that is beautiful, appreciating all

431
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:05,937
that is created out of beautiful minds,

432
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:10,838
but there should be no lust and greed in that appreciation.

433
00:48:11,133 --> 00:48:16,648
Pure appreciation, purity is the message,

434
00:48:16,702 --> 00:48:22,230
and once you have the purity within yourself you will love yourself.

435
00:48:22,505 --> 00:48:25,854
As I love you, you will love you also.

436
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:32,756
And then you will understand this word love 
which comes out of the purity.

437
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:42,191
The blossoming of your purity, 
the fragrance of your purity, you enjoy all the time

438
00:48:42,332 --> 00:48:48,334
and the love that you have flows,

439
00:48:48,445 --> 00:48:55,095
 flows towards all those who are to be loved, 
who have to be looked after.

440
00:48:55,412 --> 00:49:01,701
Don’t worry about the people who are destructive.

441
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:06,896
That's the only word I can use, 
because there are so many things one can say about.

442
00:49:07,095 --> 00:49:12,285
Let them be destructive because they are destroying themselves.

443
00:49:12,386 --> 00:49:14,967
Why should we worry about them?

444
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:17,480
They think they are destroying others but they are not,

445
00:49:17,615 --> 00:49:22,295
they are destroying themselves. 
So forget about it, just forget.

446
00:49:22,448 --> 00:49:32,150
You think yourself to be responsible for the construction 
of the whole world,

447
00:49:32,217 --> 00:49:34,937
 it's not only a few people.

448
00:49:35,255 --> 00:49:39,978
You are very intelligent, knowledgeable and understanding.

449
00:49:40,073 --> 00:49:44,689
You are not like the Disciples of Christ who were not educated,

450
00:49:44,716 --> 00:49:52,611
who didn't understand so much and 
who did get realization but were not of your level.

451
00:49:53,265 --> 00:50:01,436
Whatever they could do reached to a point 
where this kind of a mess of a Christianity has come,

452
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,772
but you can't create that kind.

453
00:50:04,856 --> 00:50:14,879
You will create a new vibrant religion which is global.

454
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:21,392
I was very happy to see that now 
we have people from all over the world.

455
00:50:21,638 --> 00:50:24,264
It’s a global movement all over.

456
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:31,843
It has nothing to do with the limited ideas of so called religions.

457
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:35,240
They have ruined every religion.

458
00:50:35,279 --> 00:50:43,504
Islam is ruined, Christianity ruined, 
and Hinduism ruined, and Buddhism the worst.

459
00:50:44,017 --> 00:50:47,047
In Buddhism you give up everything -

460
00:50:47,222 --> 00:50:54,500
all your belongings, all your property, give to the guru, imagine!

461
00:50:54,929 --> 00:51:02,417
And the guru is so greedy horrible fellow.

462
00:51:03,256 --> 00:51:09,812
How can he give resurrection?
Himself is a greedy fellow,

463
00:51:10,027 --> 00:51:15,890
misleading others just taking away everything.

464
00:51:16,917 --> 00:51:20,478
Then same thing about Christianity

465
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:23,584
that you all become Nuns,
 you become Fathers, you become

466
00:51:23,609 --> 00:51:27,362
Brothers and I don’t know, all nonsense.

467
00:51:27,619 --> 00:51:31,139
But there's no change within.

468
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:38,549
Somebody came to Me and I said, “Why did you become a priest?”

469
00:51:38,638 --> 00:51:41,348
He said, “Because I was jobless.

470
00:51:42,705 --> 00:51:44,450
I had no job.”

471
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:45,450
Baba?

472
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:47,892
“So I took up the job of a priest.”

473
00:51:47,971 --> 00:51:49,431
Can you imagine?

474
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:56,996
He could not fit into any job, so the minimum of minimum 
he took is this job.

475
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:59,553
Then what did you do?

476
00:51:59,727 --> 00:52:06,197
“They told me what I have to preach and first I had to practice

477
00:52:06,615 --> 00:52:11,107
and remember it by heart, and then I don't know,

478
00:52:11,231 --> 00:52:18,143
I started talking this, talking that.” 
I said he must be a big possessed man.

479
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:23,779
He had no mind of his own; he didn't know what he was talking.

480
00:52:23,914 --> 00:52:30,580
He would take out one sentence from Bible 
and go on talking, boring everybody.

481
00:52:30,761 --> 00:52:37,992
And I was surprised that within fifteen minutes 
people wanted to get out of the church.

482
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:45,865
As soon as the sermon was over they would run out 
and breathe, “Thank God.”

483
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:50,602
Is that what religion gives you?

484
00:52:50,817 --> 00:52:53,470
Is that what should happen to you?

485
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:56,473
No, it's not that.

486
00:52:56,617 --> 00:53:02,780
What happens to you that 
you enjoy yourself, you enjoy the collectivity,

487
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,079
you enjoy the goodness, the morality.

488
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:11,162
The whole thing is like the nectar of life.

489
00:53:12,341 --> 00:53:16,900
So that changes the whole picture.

490
00:53:17,447 --> 00:53:24,200
The ritualism is so much; in the Hindu religion 
there is too much of ritualism.

491
00:53:24,457 --> 00:53:31,954
You sit on the right or you sit on the left; 
you do this at this time I mean, lots of it.

492
00:53:32,118 --> 00:53:36,952
That when your sister dies how many days you should starve yourself;

493
00:53:36,977 --> 00:53:40,369
if your husband dies then how many days?

494
00:53:41,303 --> 00:53:46,691
Dies is died, finished; the body’s finished now.

495
00:53:47,062 --> 00:53:51,413
So you fast for so many days - is very wrong,

496
00:53:51,438 --> 00:53:55,124
because you’re fasting the bhoot might come in to you.

497
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:03,873
But still, what I would say all these ritualisms and all that,

498
00:54:04,013 --> 00:54:12,465
are created by human beings 
who were claiming to be something great.

499
00:54:12,653 --> 00:54:19,777
They are not; by no means they are the people in charge of morality,

500
00:54:19,824 --> 00:54:24,767
 in charge of higher life.

501
00:54:25,338 --> 00:54:30,881
They lead such a mundane useless life.

502
00:54:32,966 --> 00:54:36,160
I went to a temple of Shri Ganesha,

503
00:54:36,244 --> 00:54:42,284
which is supposed to be Swayambhu, 
one of the eight temples; it is one of them.

504
00:54:45,554 --> 00:54:47,261
And I was surprised.

505
00:54:47,286 --> 00:54:56,509
The man who was worshipping was supposed to be the priest, 
he was suffering from paralysis,

506
00:54:57,083 --> 00:55:04,603
and his brother died of paralysis, now his son was also paralyzed.

507
00:55:04,889 --> 00:55:08,017
He said, “What is this Ganesha doing to us Mother?”

508
00:55:08,042 --> 00:55:11,552
I said, “What are you doing to Ganesha?

509
00:55:11,814 --> 00:55:15,824
How much money you earn out of it?”

510
00:55:15,927 --> 00:55:18,536
He said, “Quite a lot.”

511
00:55:18,798 --> 00:55:21,053
“And then what do you do with this money?

512
00:55:21,078 --> 00:55:23,922
Do you do anything for the society?

513
00:55:23,947 --> 00:55:26,472
Do you try to improve their lives?

514
00:55:26,497 --> 00:55:33,034
Have you any attention on the society 
or you are just ooking after yourself?”

515
00:55:33,189 --> 00:55:39,661
As a result, he’s got paralysis,
 his brother got paralysis, son got paralysis.

516
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:43,706
And he was blaming Ganesha for that.

517
00:55:44,206 --> 00:55:48,948
He said, “Is it a real Ganesha?”
“Yes it is, but you are not.

518
00:55:49,258 --> 00:55:52,334
You don't deserve.”
I told him off on his face.

519
00:55:52,477 --> 00:55:55,908
He said, “All right you may say whatever you like but You cure me.”

520
00:55:56,027 --> 00:56:01,295
I said, “First promise that whatever money you get out of this temple

521
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:06,139
you will spend it for the betterment of people.”

522
00:56:07,098 --> 00:56:10,129
But how can they?

523
00:56:11,573 --> 00:56:13,953
They are not realized souls.

524
00:56:14,056 --> 00:56:19,326
Such a lot of priests I see walking about with all this funny dresses.

525
00:56:19,366 --> 00:56:20,366
What?

526
00:56:20,557 --> 00:56:27,686
These are like dead bodies, 
walking around with all kinds bad vibrations.

527
00:56:28,512 --> 00:56:30,707
I can't understand.

528
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:36,935
And the other people are very simple,
they say, "Oh my goodness, see now he’s a priest."

529
00:56:37,134 --> 00:56:39,007
So they must respect.

530
00:56:39,032 --> 00:56:42,744
But, they don't see it; they do not ascertain

531
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:50,369
what is the spiritual value of that person 
who calls himself as the priest.

532
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,913
That is your job.

533
00:56:54,016 --> 00:56:55,635
You don't have to fight with them.

534
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,509
You don't have to denounce them.

535
00:56:57,509 --> 00:57:00,630
You don't have to describe them.

536
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:04,470
No need, but understand that you are different.

537
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:08,345
You have the right. You are the authority

538
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,714
 and so with that authority and confidence

539
00:57:11,739 --> 00:57:14,809
 you have to go about and save people.

540
00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:18,258
You are realized souls.

541
00:57:18,411 --> 00:57:21,112
You got your resurrection.

542
00:57:21,144 --> 00:57:27,174
You are yogis; I agree, but what is your job?

543
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,851
Why, why this has happened?

544
00:57:29,938 --> 00:57:36,731
Why this light has come in to you is to take the blind

545
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:42,671
in your hands and take them towards the light.

546
00:57:42,909 --> 00:57:46,786
This is what is your resurrection for.

547
00:57:46,961 --> 00:57:56,296
It's not only for your seeking but also is the grace of the Divine,

548
00:57:56,410 --> 00:58:01,478
for you to make the whole world Divine, as far as possible.

549
00:58:01,563 --> 00:58:04,502
How many people have you given realization?

550
00:58:04,582 --> 00:58:06,616
How many people you have talked to them?

551
00:58:06,641 --> 00:58:10,043
I tell you I was surprised; once I was traveling by plane

552
00:58:10,163 --> 00:58:13,687
 and there was some lady traveling with Me

553
00:58:13,712 --> 00:58:18,635
and she started talking to Me about her cult, about her nonsense.

554
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:22,292
So look at it, shamelessly she was talking.

555
00:58:22,569 --> 00:58:28,117
Listening to her I said, Sahaja Yogis won't,
 they won't talk about Sahaja Yoga.

556
00:58:28,344 --> 00:58:34,108
Every person who is a Sahaja Yogi has to talk about Sahaja Yoga,

557
00:58:34,298 --> 00:58:38,626
may not be with the wrong type but with the right type of people.

558
00:58:39,138 --> 00:58:43,520
That's a thing you have to do. That's why you are enlightened.

559
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:48,673
You are not enlightened to be put somewhere in the forest

560
00:58:49,181 --> 00:58:52,116
or to be lost to the whole world.

561
00:58:52,141 --> 00:58:57,990
You are enlightened; you are resurrected to enlighten other people.

562
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,429
That's what you are there for

563
00:59:01,993 --> 00:59:04,583
and you can do it. Many have done it.

564
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,945
So many of you have done it,

565
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:13,594
and I would say that all of you, whether
 you are a man or a woman, you have to do it.

566
00:59:15,277 --> 00:59:25,740
And that's the request of your Mother - t
hat make use of your realization.

567
00:59:26,378 --> 00:59:32,843
And the attention should be only on realization.

568
00:59:33,228 --> 00:59:38,381
How many people you are going to give realization to?

569
00:59:38,618 --> 00:59:42,505
How many people you are going to save?

570
00:59:43,386 --> 00:59:46,450
Is a very simple job for you.

571
00:59:46,507 --> 00:59:48,488
You have to just raise the Kundalini.

572
00:59:48,586 --> 00:59:49,636
You can.

573
00:59:49,779 --> 00:59:54,295
You should see how just with your hand 
you can raise the Kundalini of others

574
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,000
 and give them their resurrection.

575
00:59:57,402 --> 00:59:59,648
You don't have to do anything.

576
00:59:59,673 --> 01:00:02,917
The life is not that difficult for you.

577
01:00:02,956 --> 01:00:07,115
Your job is the easiest thing; it’s just to raise your hand.

578
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:09,591
In hand, in your hand you have the power,

579
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:18,469
 just to raise your hand and give them realization, 
instead of feeling diffident.

580
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:24,384
That's why I would say you are all resurrected,

581
01:00:24,472 --> 01:00:27,325
you are all realized souls,

582
01:00:27,493 --> 01:00:31,095
and you have to create the Divine paradise on this earth.
