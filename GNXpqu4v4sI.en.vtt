First Public Program
Sydney, Australia

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.479
16th March, 1990

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.940
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.730
You have to know that truth is what it is.
We cannot conceptualize it with our human

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.560
awareness. We cannot order it, we cannot manipulate
it, we cannot organize it. It is what it is,

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:51.569
has been and will be. And what is the truth?
Truth is that we are surrounded or we are

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:04.969
penetrated or we are nourished, looked after
and loved by a very subtle energy which is

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.180
the energy of divine love. The second truth
is that we are not this body, this mind, these

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:33.569
conditionings, this ego, but we are the spirit.
You don’t have to accept what I’m saying

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:47.430
blindly, because blind faith leads to fanaticism.
But as scientists you must keep your minds

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:57.099
open and see for yourself what I’m saying:
if it is so, honestly you must accept it.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.700
We know so much through science about our
civilization, our advancement. This is the

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.400
advancement of a tree which has grown outside
very much; but if we do not know our roots,

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:40.240
we’ll be destroyed. So it is important to
know about our roots. And this is what it

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.860
is that I would say are our roots.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.860
As you can see, there are seven centers within
us, and these subtle centers are placed in

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:21.470
the spinal cord and the brain. These cater
to our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:32.580
needs. On the physical side they manifest
the energy for the use of our plexuses which

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:43.030
look after our physical problems. That is
on the right side, the energy which is supplied

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:58.210
by this yellow line, a subtle channel – we
call it as the Pingala Nadi – this supplies

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:10.099
energy for our physical and mental actions.
So this is the power of action within us which

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:21.400
also caters to the right sympathetic nervous
system. The another channel you see on the

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:30.099
left-hand side is the channel by which we
desire, put our energy to our desire. So this

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:40.199
is the power of desire and looks after our
emotions. This is the one which looks after

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:50.930
our conditionings also. At the end of these
two channels they create two institutions:

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:02.050
one on the right side crosses over, and the
yellow balloon that you see is the ego, is

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:09.050
the balloon of ego that we have; and the left-hand
side one that, which conditions our mind is

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:18.870
the balloon of superego. As we start growing,
in age by the time we are twelve years of

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:27.310
age, these two completely meet and the soft
bone in our head becomes completely calcified.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:41.400
Now there’s third energy within us which
is in the center, and this central energy

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:55.460
is the one which has made us human beings.
And these centers are the milestones of our

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:06.030
evolution. So now the last jumping is left
out. It has reached up to the limbic area.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:19.870
Now, only thing, it has to break through the
soft bone in the, on the head and break through

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:39.700
that, which is the actualization of baptism.
Baptism is not an artificial thing – it

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:51.810
is an actualization. But the energy that does
it is, we call it sleeping energy, in the

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:05.610
triangular bone called as sacrum. That means
the Greeks knew that this is a sacred bone,

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:15.770
that they called it “sacrum.” This energy
has to rise and break through that fontanel

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:23.620
bone area and connect us to that subtle divine
Power which we have never felt during human

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:33.500
awareness. Thus we get connected to this divine
Power, and we start feeling it on our fingertips.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:52.110
It’s described in the Koran that “at the
time of resurrection your hands will speak,

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:59.529
and they will give witness against you.”
That is, you start feeling your own centers

00:09:59.529 --> 00:10:05.970
– these are five, six and seven centers
– and they indicate what’s wrong with

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:12.970
you within yourself, what’s the problem.
Also you can feel the cool breeze coming out

00:10:17.089 --> 00:10:24.089
of your head, cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.
Because this sleeping power which is called

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:31.089
as the kundalini – “kundala” means “coils”
– is the power of pure desire within us.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:46.130
[Disturbance by a man in the audience]

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:55.380
What’s he talking? Ah …. This is the result,
you know, of tensions, on modern tensions.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:10.740
So many such things are happening. People
have no peace. That’s what I say, the tree

00:11:11.589 --> 00:11:18.589
has outgrown itself: it must find its roots.
In America they say there are fifty-five per

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:28.620
cent people who suffer from terrible nervousness,
and at least thirty per cent people have got

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:36.410
schizophrenia. It’s a very dangerous thing.
If we don’t understand how delicately we

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:50.170
are made and to realize that we are human
beings, the epitome of evolution, we are going

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:59.420
to land in great difficulties. We may try
to run away from reality, but reality will

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.420
have an effect on us.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:10.420
Now, so now we have this kind of a mechanism
within us existing. Now this is a living process

00:12:14.769 --> 00:12:21.769
of evolution, and you must understand that
we don’t pay for living process, and we

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:31.050
can’t even explain it; because when you
take a small little seed and put it in the

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:39.940
Mother Earth, it germinates by itself spontaneously.
You don’t pay to the Mother Earth anything.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:49.570
And when it germinates, it grows into a tree
and produces thousands of seeds. So in that

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:58.550
little seed the map of all the things it was
going to create is there. How it works, we

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:09.420
never ask this question. We take all the things
for granted. We don’t even ask the question

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:16.050
how this wonderful eye of ours is made like
a camera, and that how we are programmed within

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:23.050
ourselves like computers. You see this is
the color; you don’t have to think about

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:31.370
– it’s there. Through our sensory organs,
how we find out things: we’d never question

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:40.610
it. But to answer now all our questions, we
have to become the divine computer. And that’s

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:55.910
why we have to be connected to the mains,
I call them, as the people who are self-realized,

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:03.870
the people who have got their spirit in their
attention.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:13.860
When the attention is enlightened through
this happening, then you can see the absolute

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:23.720
truth. Like supposing you are holding on to
a snake and there’s darkness, and somebody

00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:32.040
tells, there is darkness, “But you have
got a snake in your hand. I can see it.”

00:14:33.529 --> 00:14:40.529
He’ll say, “No, I think it is a rope.”
Now if you put on the light, immediately that

00:14:42.649 --> 00:14:49.649
person will drop. In the same way, when the
attention gets enlightened by the spirit,

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:57.589
the first nature, innate nature of the spirit
is that it manifests absolute truth. You immediately

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:07.920
become so empowered that you give up all those
habits which are destructive to your life

00:15:07.929 --> 00:15:13.440
– immediately. I have seen people giving
up drugs overnight in London, alcoholism,

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:20.440
all kinds of things. I was amazed the way
it’s working.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:28.990
It’s your own power within you; it just
there, is existing. There’s no obligation

00:15:34.449 --> 00:15:41.449
of any kind, it’s just one enlightened candle
can enlighten another candle. That’s how

00:15:41.509 --> 00:15:48.509
it works. And it has to work – otherwise,
as I told you, we are standing on the brink

00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:55.829
of destruction. Leave alone things like drugs
and things we take to escape reality, there

00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:03.940
are so many diseases that have come up and
coming up that it is going to be very difficult

00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:14.389
for us to exist on this Mother Earth after
some time: ecological problems, the uncertainty

00:16:19.149 --> 00:16:26.149
of life, the insecurities that are built within
us. So many conditionings we have. How to

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:36.720
get rid of them? How to be cleansed is a very
big problem today. And for that I think it

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:44.060
is important that we have to get our Self-realization.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:51.060
We talk, “my, my body, my hand, my mind,
my ego” – but which is this “my”?

00:16:54.279 --> 00:17:00.949
Which is the “I” behind it? And when doctors
also talk about the autonomous nervous system,

00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:05.500
they don’t say what is this auto, who is
this auto. We say “automobile” – so

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:12.500
there is a driver sitting driving the car.
But who is driving this car? That is what

00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:21.190
we have to find out. And that auto is the
spirit within us. Unless and until the connection

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:30.980
with the Divine is established, all other
efforts are really fruitless. And that’s

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:37.610
why many people ask Me why all the religions
are fighting among themselves, why people

00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:44.450
who believe in God are fighting among themselves;
why they are so sinful, why aren’t they

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:51.450
so good. The reason is, they have not found
the truth as yet. Just believing in any God

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:59.370
or being born in any religion doesn’t make
you a righteous person at all: anybody following

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:04.419
any religion can commit any sin. There’s
no bondage.

00:18:04.419 --> 00:18:10.220
But when this kundalini rises into that green
part, as you see – we call it as a Void:

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:17.220
is the area which is like a bridging. Very
significant it is, like Moses bridged; in

00:18:17.799 --> 00:18:24.799
the same way, this is the bridging. And this
bridging, when it takes place you can cross

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:31.820
over this ocean of illusion, as we say. But
actually this ocean of illusion is representing

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:41.140
our ten valencies within us. We have ten valencies,
ten dharmas, ten – our innate nature as

00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:51.909
human beings. So when kundalini rises into
this area, it enlightens this area, and a

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:58.570
person who is a realized soul doesn’t do
anything wrong. He doesn’t cheat, he doesn’t

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:04.590
bribes, he’s not frightened. He’s so courageous,
he’s so compassionate, he’s so dynamic,

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:11.590
he’s so loving. This is only possible when
you are innately religious. Unless and until

00:19:16.679 --> 00:19:23.679
that happens, the religion outside, the man-made
religion, cannot give you what it is promising

00:19:23.679 --> 00:19:28.289
you. And that’s why people are surprised
that there is a big difference between the

00:19:28.289 --> 00:19:31.350
practice and precepts of religion.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:38.350
Every religion has said that “you seek your
Self.” So there was nothing wrong with all

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:45.990
the prophets, incarnations, all the saints.
They all said the same thing. But we have

00:19:49.169 --> 00:19:56.169
missed the point. Everything has become either
money-oriented or is an intellectual, intellectual

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:04.900
probing. It is through intellectual probing
you reach a point where you realize that you

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:12.900
have not reached the reality. So what should
we do? And this is a very great gift of modern

00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:23.039
times which was promised long time back. Is
described already in our Puranas that at the

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:31.360
time, these modern times called as Kali Yuga,
the Paramachaitanya or this all-pervading

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:38.580
Power will become active – means there is
Krita Yuga, it will become active – and

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:46.080
through it thousands of people will get their
realization. Even in the Bible they have said

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:55.350
that it’s quite a limited number. John the
– John has written in his “Revelation”

00:20:55.350 --> 00:21:02.350
it’s quite a limited number, but we have
already crossed that.

00:21:02.919 --> 00:21:09.919
And so many people have to become realized
souls. It’s very important today, and it’s

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:17.929
so easy – Sahaja. “Saha” is “with”,
“ja” is “born.” Born with you is the

00:21:17.929 --> 00:21:24.929
right to become one with the Divine, united
with the Divine – that is yoga. “Yoga”

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:33.220
is nothing but to be united with that divine
Power. That’s what yoga is; all other things

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:38.350
are subsidiary.

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:45.350
This union brings forth new dimensions on
our central nervous system. As a evolution,

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:56.640
we always develop a new dimension. By this
you develop a new awareness of collective

00:22:00.659 --> 00:22:07.659
consciousness, by which you can feel other
people, their centers. Sitting down here you

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:15.620
can feel the center of somebody – somebody
who is dead, even you can feel his centers

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:21.650
and find out what he was: was he a realized
soul or not? You can find out about anybody

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:25.630
whether he was a realized soul or not, sitting
down here. You have to just think about him,

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:29.600
put your hands. If you are a realized soul
you can feel on your fingertips what is the

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:36.600
problem. And somehow if you know how to correct
those problems, you get rid of your own diseases

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:46.210
and the diseases of others, your own problems
and the problems of others.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:54.250
First you enter into a state of mind which
we call as “thoughtless awareness.” When

00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:03.010
you cross this center of Agnya that is placed
in the optic chiasma, you become thoughtlessly

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:10.020
aware. You are aware, but there is no thought.
What a blessing it is! Say, I see a carpet

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:18.380
here, it’s beautiful, and when I look at
it if I start thinking “what a good carpet!”

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:22.659
If it is Mine it’s a very big headache because
I’ll be thinking, “I hope it goes home,

00:23:22.659 --> 00:23:29.659
is already insured, is not lost, is not spoilt”
– all kinds of worries about this carpet.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:35.559
Thank God it’s not Mine, so I’ll look
at it, still I start thinking how much I should

00:23:35.559 --> 00:23:40.559
pay to get it, from where can I get it; all
these thoughts coming.

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:47.559
But if I look at it without any thoughts,
then the joy of its creation, to whomsoever

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:56.970
it may belong, so-called, starts pouring on
Me like beautiful flow of joy. Whatever the

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:12.210
artist has put into it, all his joy starts
pouring, that peace and that joyous feeling

00:24:15.059 --> 00:24:22.059
within Me when I don’t think about it. Thinking
makes a person mad, creates lots of problems.

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:31.990
Too much thinking is wasteful, also. As I’ll
tell you about the second center we have here,

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:39.940
tomorrow, about the second center, that by
thinking, how many diseases you get.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:46.940
The other day I was in a radio station and
the gentleman was asking Me, “How can I

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:54.600
get rid of my diabetes? You say that by thinking
it happens.”

00:24:54.600 --> 00:25:01.600
I said, “Yes.” Because in India if they
have to take tea in a village, the sugar is

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:10.970
put so much that the spoon must stand at right
angle! And nobody gets diabetes. But people

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:21.350
who are sedentary, planning too much – I
mean mostly, say, bureaucrats, diplomats,

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:31.010
politicians – they are very vulnerable.
What is the reason for that, which I’ll

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:36.140
explain to you tomorrow, how we get all these
diseases because we think too much and we

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:42.909
cannot stop thinking.

00:25:42.909 --> 00:25:49.909
But so far, we have to understand that we
are all on the, either on the right side or

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:58.090
on the left side. We are not in the center.
The centers are like this, I would say: the

00:26:00.279 --> 00:26:07.279
left and the right, and the left side and
the right side join together to make the center.

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:12.779
Now supposing you are right-sided – means
you are using too much of your physical or

00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:19.779
mental aptitudes, you are planning for future,
you are very futuristic – then this starts

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:28.529
extracting energy from this center and starts
moving to the left, right, starts moving to

00:26:28.529 --> 00:26:35.529
the right. At the same time if something happens
on the left side and you get a jerk, it is

00:26:37.899 --> 00:26:44.899
broken. Then you are vulnerable to diseases
which we call as psychosomatic, because this

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:52.840
is the one is the somatic and this is the
psycho. And these diseases cannot be cured.

00:26:58.399 --> 00:27:05.169
Because if somebody’s a doctor then he doesn’t
know about psychology; somebody is psychologist,

00:27:05.169 --> 00:27:09.380
he doesn’t know the medicine. I mean, we
have doctors for one eye and another doctor

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:13.630
for another eye! We have gone to that limit
of specialization.

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:20.630
This is the science of integration. Is not
a science of specialization but integration,

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:32.360
because this is one body which has got the
nose, eyes, ears all stuck to one body. And

00:27:33.429 --> 00:27:40.190
this is one personality, and we have to deal
with this personality as a whole. But if you

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:47.190
start treating it like one for the nose, one
for the ears, it’s not going to work out.

00:27:47.299 --> 00:27:54.299
So when this kundalini rises through these
centers it brings them back to normal, to

00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:01.880
the balance, integrates them one with another
and connects them with the mains from where

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:11.600
the energy flows inside. And that’s how
you become very dynamic, you don’t get tired,

00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:20.950
you feel very young, you never feel your age;
and you are extremely compassionate and kind,

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:30.029
and you love to do good to others.

00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:37.029
It is so much I have to tell you. Now Sahaja
Yoga is working in forty nations, and working

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:46.289
out very well. The most surprising place was
USSR. And now the people are saying, “Mother,

00:28:46.289 --> 00:28:51.809
You have been working for twenty years in
the West and only went last year to USSR,

00:28:51.809 --> 00:28:57.990
and You have more Sahaja yogis there than
You have all over the world.” Not in India:

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:01.510
we have many more, of course, because they
know about it, they were not ignorant, so

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:08.320
it’s all right – if you forget India.
I don’t know what’s so special about them

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.840
that they could see this so clearly.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:19.840
And one of the snags of Sahaja Yoga is that
you cannot pay for it. And this really is

00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:27.549
the very great snag, I think, because a gentleman
from BBC in England told Me that Anglo-Saxon

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:34.590
brain cannot understand anything that can
be done without money. I said, “Who has

00:29:34.679 --> 00:29:41.679
made this brain, God or somebody else?”
It’s very surprising! And even in, I went

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:48.820
to Toronto – no, Boston – and they said,
“How many Rolls-Royces You’ve got?”

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:55.110
I said, “I have none, because I don’t
take any money. Whatever I have is of My husband’s.”

00:29:55.110 --> 00:30:00.460
They said, “Then we are not interested.
You have to be in the business.”

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:07.460
It’s very shocking, this kind of a attitude
towards Divine. I said, “How much money

00:30:08.779 --> 00:30:15.779
did you pay to Christ?”

00:30:15.809 --> 00:30:22.399
Today also there was a question from a radio,
and they asked Me, “You don’t take any

00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:24.890
money; then how do You travel?”

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:31.809
I said, “So far, for quite some time I was
travelling with My husband’s money, no doubt.

00:30:31.809 --> 00:30:37.269
But now we have so many Sahaja yogis and they
have some self-respect, and they don’t pay

00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:44.269
Me, they pay to the travel agents, not to
Me. They don’t want I to pay for them – then

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:50.880
tomorrow will say ‘all right, You pay for
our food also!’” I mean, any self-respecting

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:57.880
people can understand that. So if somebody
does not take money, they go to that limit

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:04.890
that even I should pay for their salvation,
coming to their place I should pay for the

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:13.220
hall, I should pay for everything. This kind
of a brain – oh, it’s not all, all of

00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:20.860
you are not Anglo-Saxon, I hope so! – I
can’t understand. And that’s why it has

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:25.730
not come up to the point where it should have.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:32.730
On the contrary, I must say Russians are very
brave people. With the war they have become

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:47.399
very strong. On the contrary, in other countries
I have seen with the war they have become

00:31:47.399 --> 00:31:54.399
very nervous, very frightened. And immediately
they took to Sahaja Yoga for one point, that

00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:03.470
you cannot pay for it. They could see it,
that you can’t pay because it’s a living

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:10.470
process. Is such a wisdom that clicked. You
won’t believe, in England I was fighting

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:21.620
with seven hippies for four years: the questions,
the bombardment and – too much! I was about

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:29.870
to give up. They just thought that it’s
something to be attacked. And that’s the

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:40.760
reason they attacked all the saints, all the
incarnations and all the prophets.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:51.320
But I hope now everybody realizes that we
are in trouble. We are all in trouble. We

00:32:52.429 --> 00:32:58.059
don’t know what’s going to happen next
day. We might get into cancer, might get into

00:32:58.059 --> 00:33:05.059
some other trouble. We might have any problem
that we do not know about. We are not sure

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:13.630
of our future. So it is better that we get
our special energy that is within us, we get

00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:21.320
ourselves enlightened and take to something
that will make us much wiser, healthier, joyous

00:33:26.289 --> 00:33:32.159
and knowledgeable. “Knowledge” does not
mean what you know through your brains, but

00:33:32.159 --> 00:33:34.620
on your central nervous system.

00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:41.620
That’s what everybody said, that the time
has come – it’s a blossom time, I call

00:33:45.399 --> 00:33:52.399
it. There are thousands and thousands who
can get realization. It’s such a great blessing

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:59.100
that we could have en masse realization. On
the Tree of Life there would have been only

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:06.100
one or two flowers to begin with, but today
I call it a blossom time. Is actually the

00:34:07.799 --> 00:34:14.799
Day of Judgment, but “blossom time” seems
better to say – is more promising. I hope

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:24.630
tonight we all will get realization and enjoy
ourselves. May God bless you all.

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:42.500
I would like you to ask Me some questions,
because today is a first day. I’m sorry,

00:34:42.500 --> 00:34:47.030
the mike was not all right so they started
very late, they said. The musicians have come

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:54.030
from India – and you’d be amazed that
Australians, Swiss, Germans, English, all

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:05.160
of them have learned Sanskrit songs and Marathi
songs, which is such a difficult language,

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:14.390
all these songs – and they have learnt English
songs. It was impossible to teach an Englishman

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:23.110
one sentence in Hindi. One gentleman asked
Me, “What do you say to the 'close the door'?”

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:34.450
So My father told him, “You just say 'there
was a banker.' That means ‘you close the

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:41.670
door’! And for opening the door you say
'there was a cold day.' That’s how you will

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:49.160
say 'open the door'!” So it was so difficult,
and I’m amazed how through Sahaja Yoga they

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:51.560
have become so dynamic.

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:58.400
We have got many artists now flowering out.
In your country itself there are so many artists

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:05.400
who have come out of Sahaja Yoga. They are
very well known here. Also great potters and

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:13.650
ceramic makers have come out of this. It’s
working on this part, on this area of creativity,

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:24.220
and lots of musicians have become great musicians
in India. It’s working out in another direction

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:32.030
in England, that people are writing books
and they have become good orators who would

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:39.030
never come on the stage. So this is on a worldly
level, we should say, but they themselves

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:46.370
are so patient and so loving that the happiest
thing I would like to tell you is that twenty-five

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:53.430
Germans rushed to USSR, to Russia, to help
Me to give realization to Russians. It was

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:04.820
very touching, really, to see Germans should
feel that innately that it’s their duty

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:12.280
to give them realization. They spent their
own money coming down there. It’s rather

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:17.360
difficult to go to Russia because you have
to pay for the hotels beforehand and all that.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:24.200
They did all that and they were there. It’s
a beautiful that’s happening in the world,

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:31.120
very beautiful people. And the way they admire
each other and adore, it’s wonderful.

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:37.650
So I would expect you to ask Me some questions.
But the questions should be relevant because

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:43.180
I’m not here to aggress you, I’m here
just to give you what you have, your own property.

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:48.790
So there’s no need to be aggressive with
Me or to be angry with Me. I’ve not come

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:55.770
here to take anything from you. So in a sensible
way, whatever you want to ask please ask,

00:37:55.770 --> 00:38:02.570
and we should not waste also time of other
people who are anxious to have their realization.

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:08.680
[Question: Is Mr. Gorbachev realized?]

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:15.680
Yes, he is very much. Thank God for that!

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:26.680
[Question: What about Mr. Bush then?]

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:28.230
Who?

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:30.670
[Mr. Bush.]

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:33.340
You can give him realization. You can.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:39.160
[Question: What for?]

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:46.160
It’s better not to ask about that. You see,
even Americans don’t understand sometimes

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:59.270
that if Gorbachev has opted for democracy
he’s not opted for an American style of

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:05.110
democracy, because American democracy has
not created very good atmosphere. It’s a,

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:11.430
if you go to America you can’t even wear
a wedding ring. They can kill you even for

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:15.560
a wedding ring. Such a situation is there.
Horrible!

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:21.880
And I was going once on a Los Angeles road
and the one who was driving Me told Me that

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.830
“Mother, put down Your head.”

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:23.360
I said, “Why?”

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.890
And he said, “On this road last week eleven
people were killed.”

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:27.990
I said, “Why?”

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:29.250
“For the heck of it.”

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:36.250
I said, “For the heck of it? So mad?”

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:43.440
So that democracy has not created a good society,
not good society. They have money, that’s

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:51.380
all. But money is also not so much well-balanced,
I would say; it doesn’t create good people,

00:39:54.820 --> 00:40:01.820
good children, good families. It should be
the money which is auspicious, which should

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:09.600
create good atmosphere. And very sick people
there are: certain are very silly also, stupid.

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:20.090
Like eighty-two-year-old people, cinema actors
and actresses, going for a shake dance – they’re

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:30.920
already shaking! I mean, this I can’t understand.
And they, they want to ride horses at the

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:45.380
age of ninety-two years of age. And then they
fall down and die. What is the need at ninety-two

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:52.380
to ride a horse? I mean, there’s no maturity.
If democracy cannot mature you, then it’s

00:40:55.030 --> 00:41:02.030
not nourishing. It must mature; you must become
a wiser person. If you still remain a sixteen-year-old

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:10.640
brat, what’s the use?

00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:19.430
So it has failed somewhere. As communism has
failed, it has also failed. But Gorbachev

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:27.280
could see. Mr. Bush has to also see that.
Also the way they are supporting these Azerbaijanis

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:33.420
– they’re horrible people, these Azerbaijani.
I’ve been there, I’ve been to Samarkand

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:38.750
and I’ve been to all these places, and they
were rolling in luxuries, rolling in luxuries

00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:43.570
when I went there, thousand time better than
their neighbors Afghanis.

00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:49.790
But they said, “We are very miserable because
we can’t follow Islam.”

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:54.240
But I said, “Why do you want to follow Islam?
What Islam has done good or Christianity has

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:58.150
done good? Why are you so much anxious to
follow Islam?”

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:00.190
“No, we must have.”

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:04.720
And now the Iranians are penetrating that,
and if you support these Azerbaijanis you

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:11.720
are supporting the Iranians and their fundamentalism.
So there’s no thought given to it. It’s

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:19.300
not a proper vision; it’s a very blurred
vision. One should see clearly what we are

00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:27.190
doing, who are we helping. There should be
some principle in what we are doing. Imagine,

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:38.230
Abraham Lincoln who started, who was a realized
soul himself, and how far you have taken him

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:47.370
there? And there’s only one single road
somewhere in his name. I mean, nobody bothers

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:53.790
about the principles he established. So something
has gone wrong there. So we must sit back

00:42:53.790 --> 00:43:00.790
and see that what’s wrong with our democracy.
And in all these democratic countries all

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:14.910
kinds of false gurus have prospered, because
everybody has freedom to give the money to

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:16.930
whosoever they like.

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:23.930
Yes? These two ladies …. All right, you
ask first.

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:35.530
[Question: She’s been doing yoga for fifteen
years. And she says she has reached all these

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:56.150
points that You have mentioned, but she is
weak on her left side. Can You help her?]

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:04.250
Yah. It’s just the outcome of the modern
yoga, absolutely. Actually, Patanjali has

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:15.500
written such a big book on Hatha Yoga. Nobody
reads that. Only they have taken a wee, wee,

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:23.940
wee part of it, which is ashtanga, means there
are eight portions out of which one portion

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:32.580
is yam niyam, out of which it’s one-eighth
of the portion is about exercise, the physical.

00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:42.650
But that also is to be used when your kundalini
is rising and you see the defects in your

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:51.340
spinal cord, or anywhere in your chakras:
then you must know if there is any need for

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:59.350
a physical correction – all right? But the
way we are doing now Hatha Yoga is like taking

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:07.300
all the medicines of the medicine box inside,
without any discrimination. So when we pay

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:12.180
so much attention to the physical side, we
go to the right side and left side is neglected.

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:19.180
There’s an imbalance. And you develop lots
of physical troubles also – physical. Like

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:26.030
these days jogging is a fashion, so everybody’s
jogging. Everybody wants to be a cinema actress,

00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:32.420
or might be a beauty competition – I don’t
know what they want. And they don’t understand

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:38.390
that we are human beings, we are delicately
made. Even old people of eighty years are

00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:45.390
jogging, for what? And then they get heart
attacks, serious troubles.

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:53.400
So this kind of a Hatha Yoga weakens your
left side to such an extent that a woman may

00:45:53.400 --> 00:46:00.400
not be able to produce a child, even. Apart
from that, a man who does Hatha Yoga of this

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:06.030
kind is such a hot-tempered fellow, like an
oven, that you’d better approach that person

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:13.030
with a barge-pole! God knows when he’ll
jump on you. But in Sahaja Yoga you’ll achieve

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:20.330
your balance. So don’t, not to do so many
exercises now, discriminately understanding

00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:26.460
which one you want, you have to do – that
much you should do.

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:33.460
Yes. Then there’s one lady here who raised
the hand.

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:43.250
[Question: How can you tell whether you are
acting from intuition or if it's just the

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:52.830
desire of the moment?]

00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:56.160
You mean you are asking Me or about yourself?

00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:03.160
[Question: In a general sense. How can you
tell the difference?]

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:10.230
Because you have not reached that state of
Self-realization. In Self-realization if you

00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:20.930
ask a question, any question: say, somebody
says, “I don’t believe in God.” All

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:27.930
right, ask a question, “Is there God?”
three times, and you get a beautiful wind

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:36.860
coming on you. “Was Christ the Son of God?”
Ask this question: you get it. Then ask about

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:47.290
some horrid guru who has been lynching you,
and you will get burns, might get even blisters.

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:55.240
But unless and until you are a realized soul,
you have to – it’s not easy to make it

00:47:55.240 --> 00:48:02.240
out. The only thing, you have to be connected
first of all and to be established. Then you

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:09.960
reach a state of doubtless awareness, from
the thoughtless awareness. And then you become

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:10.210
tremendous.

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:16.330
[Sahaja yogi: There’s one right at the back.]

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:22.560
Anyone.

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:29.560
[Question: Does your realization take place
instantly or does it take place gradually?]

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:46.740
It takes instantly, My child. It should. Most
of the cases it has to; it’s so spontaneous.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:54.620
There was a saint called Ramadasa who was
the guru of Shivaji, a great king in India

00:48:54.620 --> 00:49:00.970
– a realized soul, again – and somebody
asked that saint, “How much time does it

00:49:00.970 --> 00:49:03.070
take for the kundalini to rise?”

00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:08.220
And in Sanskrit he said, “Tatkshan” – means
“that moment.” That moment. But there

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:15.220
has to be the person who gives you realization
authorized by the Divine, and the one who

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:24.090
is a seeker of truth. I mean, I’m Myself
surprised the way it's happening today, everywhere.

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:34.470
These days it’s really very surprising that
the Divine is so anxious to give you realization.

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:39.290
Many people ask Me, “Mother, why do You
give realization to so many people?”

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:43.790
I said, “How can I limit it? Now it has
become limitless.”

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:50.790
Some, like the parable of Christ, fall in
the marshy land and just sprouted and lost

00:49:53.780 --> 00:50:00.780
– I know that. But they’ll come back;
I’m sure they’ll come back. But some do

00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:08.180
prosper very fast and settle down. Imagine
in a place like Russia, I thought this must

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:14.020
be just wilderness, there I find beautiful
things happening. They, they never talked

00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:21.020
of God, they never talked of religion, they
never talked of spirituality. And openly I

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:30.260
talked of God and everything; nobody arrested
Me there. Here, we who worship God and who

00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:39.620
have so many churches, who have so many temples
and mosques and all that, you have – I have

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:46.620
to move like a criminal! Except for their
church or their mosque or their temples, you

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:53.930
are a cult; while they take all the money,
everything – they are very money-oriented

00:50:53.930 --> 00:51:00.930
and power-oriented also – but you are a
cult! Is very funny.

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:09.890
Yes, please? There’s still the another gentleman
also? …. All right. They need to ask Me

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:10.210
….

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:15.550
[Question: Mother, I’ve been trying for
about two months, but I don’t feel any cool

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:16.070
breeze up here.]

00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:23.070
You feel it in your hands?

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:25.410
[No, I don’t.]

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:30.810
All right, we’ll see about it. After the
program – ah, definitely today you’ll

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:34.720
feel it.

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:41.720
[Question: Where in the seven centers would
You place instinct?]

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:50.770
You see, “instinct” is a very confusing
word – all right? In the seventh center

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:58.580
when you arrive, you arrive in the limbic
area. And limbic area has got the seven seats

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:05.580
of seven centers. So you cannot say that any
particular place is the instinct, but the

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:16.540
instinct comes from the Divine. So when it
is connected with the Divine, you receive

00:52:19.510 --> 00:52:26.510
it in your brain and it’s transmitted to
your nerves. Also it is transmitted to your

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:38.240
centers, nourishing it. So you cannot categorize
it.

00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:49.580
Yes, what is it? Ask, ask!

00:52:53.460 --> 00:53:00.460
[Question: He finds it very confusing: what
is mind, what is a thought and what is thinking?]

00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:14.860
I think tomorrow I’m going to talk about
thinking. In that I’ll tell you everything

00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:20.660
– all right? Can you keep it for tomorrow,
please? All right? Tomorrow I’ll tell you.

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:26.100
[Question: Got food anything to do with this
process or technique?]

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:32.700
You see, any kind of food that you eat has
to be suitable for your temperament, your

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:37.760
prakriti. It has to be suitable. Supposing
you are a very right-sided person, then it’s

00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:43.960
better for you to take more to carbohydrates.
But supposing you are a left-sided person,

00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:49.930
is better for you to take to proteins. There’s
no hard and fast rule about it. It has to

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:56.930
be complementary to your nature. That’s
how we decide. Every individual has a different

00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:04.750
temperament, and accordingly we have to decide
what sort of food one should take. … May

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:12.570
God bless.

00:54:12.570 --> 00:54:19.570
[Question: Two questions, Shri Mother. One,
are You a vegetarian? And secondly, does the

00:54:23.410 --> 00:54:27.800
soul have a memory?]

00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:34.660
All right. About Me you’d better discover.
You see, I don’t talk about Myself. The

00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:41.660
reason is this: anybody who tried to seek,
say anything about oneself or claim anything,

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:49.650
people have been very nasty. Christ said,
“I am the Son of God” – which is a fact.

00:54:53.430 --> 00:55:00.430
They crucified Him. He didn’t tell a lie.
So I’m very tactful! So you first get your

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:11.490
realization, because I don’t want to get
crucified just now; I want to postpone it

00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:18.490
as much as possible! So about Me you can find
out, once you get your realization, is better.

00:55:20.810 --> 00:55:24.320
What is the second?

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:28.220
[Question: Does the soul have a memory?]

00:55:28.220 --> 00:55:33.580
Soul has a memory, of course it has. Soul
also is another subject which will take at

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:40.490
least three, four lectures, and I have given
lectures on that. You can take the tape and

00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:47.420
see for yourself, and after realization you
can see those dead souls also and also you

00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:54.420
can see the Chaitanya, these vibrations, as
small little commas shining. After realization

00:55:55.460 --> 00:56:00.520
you see them. And now there are lots of discoveries
have been made which I’ve said about soul,

00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:07.520
which you can also see from My tapes and can
hear about it. It’s a very long subject.

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:37.950
All right?

00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:44.950
[Question: He has some artificial heart valves
and things in his body, and he wonders if

00:56:50.290 --> 00:56:55.050
a person who has artificial organs can obtain
Self-realization.]

00:56:55.050 --> 00:57:02.050
Of course, you can. Anybody who is living
can get realization. Because, you are living

00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:11.910
because there is spirit within you. The day
spirit disappears from your heart, we are

00:57:17.610 --> 00:57:24.610
no more. On the contrary, your heart condition
will improve, very much. Many people who had

00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:33.590
bypass got rid of it. Many people who had
angina got completely cured. Many heart patients

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:37.390
were cured completely.

00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:44.390
Yes, now, you ask. Now she is asking. … Can
you hear her? Little loudly, can you?

00:57:57.460 --> 00:58:04.460
[Question: Apparently the authors of a lot
of these chakra books say that each chakra

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:22.310
corresponds to a different …]

00:58:22.310 --> 00:58:22.560
Areas.

00:58:22.370 --> 00:58:23.150
[Question continues: ... corroboration of
your soul, of your being. Is that actually

00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:24.810
true? Like as in the chakra here – ]

00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:25.480
Agnya.

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:32.090
[Question continues: Yeah. If, they say that
if that’s opened, you are able to perceive

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:33.730
things in other beings; like you’re able
to see where they have been and … or you

00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:34.750
are able to use psychic powers and things,
you know? Is that actually true?]

00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:38.170
Yah. Now, this chakra is very important … This
chakra of Agnya which is on the optic chiasma

00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:45.170
is a very important center. It is a very constricted
thing, and the resurrection of Christ has

00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:55.510
solved the problem for us, because He was
resurrected and He's bestowed upon on this

00:58:55.510 --> 00:59:02.510
chakra. He’s the ruling deity of this chakra.
So when kundalini awakens Him on this chakra,

00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:11.670
He sucks in these two balloons, as I told
you: ego and superego. Now the ego and superego

00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:21.460
are controlled by two organs or two things,
what we call as the pituitary and the pineal.

00:59:24.330 --> 00:59:30.940
So this center controls pituitary and the
pineal part. Also it is on the optic chiasma.

00:59:30.940 --> 00:59:37.940
So you can see things clearly through it.
When it is awakened, you start seeing subtler

00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:47.640
things. But if you see the light, then it’s
not correct. That means you have moved to

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:52.550
the right, because you see elements on the
right side. You may see also the past: you

00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:59.550
may, you may see Krishna; you may see somebody,
the past. What you have to see, whatever you

01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:08.960
see, you are not that. Supposing I see the
light, I am not the light. So you have to

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:15.960
be the light. So this movement is deviation
from reality. Either to the right, to the

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:23.750
left, is not correct and should not be considered
as some achievement, because seeing gives

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:31.950
you nothing. Being gives you. It is becoming;
you have to become. All right? Now, is there?

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:53.120
[Question: Are our actions governed by free
will, or is it just fate?]

01:00:53.120 --> 01:01:00.120
It’s free will, absolute free will. You
have come here with your free will, and I

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:09.360
respect your free will, your freedom. If you
don’t want to have Self-realization, it

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:17.240
cannot be forced, it cannot be done. It respects
your free will. You can only get it if you

01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:27.730
in free will, in your free glory, you want
to have it. In a way, of course, it does help

01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:38.690
people who live in moderation; but as I told
you, the Divine is so anxious that whatever

01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:45.250
you might have been, you get your realization,
sort of a thing happening today. That’s

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:52.250
what I’ve seen it. So that’s what you
should expect, and shouldn’t think of your

01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:57.220
past at all. Forget it. Yes?

01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:58.940
[Question: What then of karma?]

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:05.940
Karma, as I told you, is sucked in when the
kundalini rises through this center. She’s

01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:13.400
sucked in those two institutions. One of them
is of ego. Is the only ego tells us we are

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:18.040
doing karmas. Animals don’t feel they are
committing sins or doing karmas; only we,

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:24.010
because we have ego. This ego is sucked in.
So all our karmas are finished. They said

01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:31.010
Christ has died for our sins, and that is
proved. … So far …

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:49.260
[Question: In regard to reincarnation, do
humans come back as humans?]

01:02:59.350 --> 01:03:06.350
Yes, they do. Some of them do come from animal
stage also, because that we can explain why

01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:08.910
they behave like this!

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:15.910
[Question: Mother, I’ve been getting very
powerful sensations on this finger here and

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:26.580
this area here. What is the cause of that
disturbance …?]

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:31.670
What is the feeling? In the Agnya, here? Here
and here. You are feeling heat?

01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:38.670
[Pain on top of that finger and a small, a
kind of heat and pain there …]

01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:47.460
Here? All right. You don’t worry about the
cause. We’ll correct it. All right? It’s,

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:57.020
it’s better not to know about it. It’s
nothing serious but still … You see, this

01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:59.550
may be that – what is your job?

01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:06.550
[I don’t have a job. I was in an auto accident
last year and I’ve been incapacitated since.]

01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:08.760
Incapacitated?

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.020
[Yes.]

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:09.290
How?

01:04:09.290 --> 01:04:16.290
[Injuries to both legs and right up to my
abdomen, right up to my chest.]

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:18.500
What he said?

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:19.320
[Sahaja yogi: He's had severe injuries to
both legs and his torso up to his chest.]

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:19.810
And on your left hand, what are you feeling?

01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:24.100
[A lot of pain in that finger there and a
pain just here which is in line with the third

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:24.350
finger.]

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:24.720
All of them?

01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:31.720
[Sahaja yogi: The right Vishuddhi, Shri Mother
…]

01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:38.760
[And this one here.]

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:45.760
All right. So this is, this is definitely
connected with your body and that has to be

01:04:47.530 --> 01:04:53.820
corrected, that’s all. All right? Then you
won’t feel anything.

01:04:53.820 --> 01:05:00.820
[Question: Why do we take on the physical
state?]

01:05:04.550 --> 01:05:11.550
You cannot get realization without it, My
child. You cannot get
it in the air!

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:31.480
[Question: He said, if realization is the
dropping away of habits, isn’t riding a

01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:47.770
horse at ninety-five just a matter of habit?]

01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:54.300
No, no, no, no, no! You didn’t understand.
No, what happens, you become a very powerful

01:05:54.300 --> 01:06:00.960
personality. And you become an enlightened
personality. So you drop out whatever is bad

01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.050
for you, that’s all.

[Question: Is horse-riding necessarily bad?]

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:12.920
Anything that is not good for you, you understand
and nobody has to tell you. You become your

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:17.630
own master, you become your own guru and you
drop it. I don’t have to tell you “don’t

01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:21.800
do this” or “don’t do that” – you
just do it yourself. Isn’t it better for

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:28.800
Me? (Now, so many questions; it’s ten o’clock
about, yes?)

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:37.060
[Unclear question]

[Sahaja yogi: I don’t think I got that one.
…. I think he said, if You promote the idea

01:07:16.310 --> 01:07:23.310
of jumping into the divine flow of vibrations
and want to clear ourselves, once upon a time

01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:28.420
we jumped into the river to get clean but
now the river is polluted. Are there dangers

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:31.790
in jumping into the spirit?]

01:07:31.790 --> 01:07:38.790
No, no, not at all dangerous – it’s wonderful!
No, no, not at all dangerous: that’s a myth.

01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:45.130
That’s a myth about kundalini. It’s such
a myth they have created because they never

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:50.070
wanted you to get your realization, so that
they could make money out of you, you see.

01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:55.580
They don’t want you to go to reality. So
then, they can use you. That’s the reason

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:59.880
they said all these things. It has no meaning.
We have now been working in so many places,

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:06.450
I’ve never seen. At the most some people,
like this lady who was here was sick, was

01:08:06.450 --> 01:08:12.090
shaking her hand, and then she put it to her
Mother Earth and she was sitting before Me,

01:08:12.090 --> 01:08:18.409
and she got all right. So her shaking stopped.
It was Parkinson’s. Just sitting here; she’s

01:08:18.409 --> 01:08:18.659
gone now.

01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:18.839
[Question: What is the flame, Shri Mother
‒ the spirit? What is the flame? …. On

01:08:18.839 --> 01:08:23.140
the chart.]

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:30.140
Where is the flame?

01:08:31.730 --> 01:08:38.230
[Sahaja yogi: On the left Heart.]

01:08:38.230 --> 01:08:45.230
On the left Heart is the spirit. Is the spirit.
It’s difficult to show spirit, you see,

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:55.960
so they have shown it as a flame.

01:08:58.449 --> 01:09:05.449
[Question: Do dreams have a part in one's
spirit?]

01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:12.870
They come from different areas. They don’t
only come from collective subconscious, they

01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:18.830
come also from the subconscious that you have
had in past lives, maybe in this life; could

01:09:18.830 --> 01:09:25.120
be from just from yesterday. So it depends
on from what area it comes. But it’s not

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:29.420
important. Once you know the real truth, then
you don’t bother about these things; because

01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:35.170
the communication is not circuitous, it’s
just direct, so you know the truth. So you’re

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:39.580
not interested to know any more.

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:46.580
[Question: Is there
a place for sorrow in someone who is self-realized?]

01:09:54.100 --> 01:10:01.100
No, no, not at all. It’s such a joy. You
see, sorrow comes through our ignorance. Also

01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:13.010
they want to, you to feel sorry for everything,
you know. Like the way they show Christ like

01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:20.010
a skeleton, you see, naturally you feel sorry;
but only Michelangelo could see clearly that

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:27.340
it was a great Personality. So he painted
Him like a great giant in the, you see Him

01:10:28.690 --> 01:10:35.690
in the Sistine Chapel. But below on the table
they have placed a skeleton of Christ which

01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:44.440
is, creates such horrible feelings within
yourself. I think we should ask one of these

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:51.290
priests to carry one, the cross across and
see if they can do it with their skeleton

01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:52.000
bodies.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:59.000
So sorrow is also created. Also, people like
to show they are sorry. Like this Greek tragedy

01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:08.110
has no sense in it; just make it Greek tragedy,
unnecessarily. I mean, one gentleman falls

01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:19.650
in love: he falls, doesn’t rise, falls in
love! And then he doesn’t marry that person;

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:27.840
then he is pining. I mean, human life is worth
much more, not to pine after one lady. Then

01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:35.240
in next year he marries that lady. I mean
this is the – you see, everything must have

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:41.080
an antithesis also. So then he marries the
same lady, and then he wants to get rid of

01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:48.080
her somehow. And then he murders her out of
frustration. This should be the story, because

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:55.570
this kind of wasteful habits of human beings
leading nowhere. You cannot get joy from another

01:11:56.250 --> 01:12:03.250
person: joy is your own property. This comes
from your own spirit. It doesn’t depend

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:11.820
on another person. Only a realized soul can
enjoy another realized soul. Only you understand

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:19.270
the value of another person when you are a
realized soul, and another person is also

01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:25.210
a realized soul; otherwise you cannot. Yes?

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:29.780
[Unclear question]

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:36.780
You see, Gorbachev has solved one problem,
a little bit. Because these are two superior

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:54.440
powers, you see: super-most, we can call,
superpowers. So the, you need two hands to

01:12:54.520 --> 01:13:00.690
clap. So one hand has receded. Now this hand
doesn’t know what to do, what to hit, so

01:13:00.690 --> 01:13:07.690
it has to recede also. So in a way, the pressure
of war he has lessened, and he is going to

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:16.120
lessen more. But I think today the world problem
is, if you see internationally, is fundamentalism.

01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:25.630
Is fundamentalism. And those who try to encourage
fundamentalism are really committing sins

01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:32.630
against humanity, I think. So fundamentalism
I find as the biggest problem, and to answer

01:13:33.170 --> 01:13:35.710
to this is Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:39.880
Then our social problems come because we don’t
understand the role of a woman and the role

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:45.190
of a man; and when we don’t respect women
for their great role they are playing, they

01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:52.190
become something funny. So all this understanding
comes to you very beautifully when you become

01:13:53.000 --> 01:14:00.000
a self-realized person. Another problem is
ecological problem, comes out of our own imbalances.

01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:07.170
Whatever is inside, we manifest outside. You
see, there’s so much imbalance in us.

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:14.650
Like in, when we were in India I never allowed
any drinks in My house. I said, “All right,

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:19.420
if you want to drink, drink in your house
and come to My house.” But I can’t understand

01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:26.420
a person who is drunk. God knows, he might
just get up and slap Me or do anything! But

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:33.740
when we went to London, they, they said we
have to offer them. I said, “All right.”

01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:39.050
I told My husband, “You arrange all that.
Do it yourself.” That time ‒ it’s long

01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:46.050
time back I’m telling you ‒ just to buy
crystal tumblers for an ordinary party we

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:55.000
had to shell out nine hundred pounds, to begin
with. That’s the beginning of the library.

01:14:57.490 --> 01:15:02.790
And so many were to be added later on. There
is one cup for this and a one cup for that

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:09.790
– I mean, a one cup is sufficient. And one
tumbler for that and this – big, it’s

01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:19.950
a big science, you know ‒ books after books.
I told My husband, “You’d better get it

01:15:20.670 --> 01:15:26.540
and read it.” Then we hired three, four
people. I said, “Baba, you look after these

01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:32.070
people.” Somebody wants this, somebody wants
that, and it’s a very big sort of a social

01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:33.110
nonsensical wastage.

01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:40.110
So these things we have created. Then, fork
and spoon, you start from here, go on like

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:50.600
that; and then go on that way. There’s no
need to do all that. And I understand, if

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:57.490
it was something artistic, all right, some
artists are doing. But these days there’s

01:15:57.490 --> 01:16:02.580
no art: it’s so simple, there’s no art
in it. If there’s even one flower they don’t

01:16:02.580 --> 01:16:09.580
like it – this is too much. No art anywhere,
no Limoges, it’s just straightforward march.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:18.160
So all this creation is all useless rubbish
which will form another plastic mountain.

01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:27.210
So this ecological problem has come because
we have no sense of balance and discretion.

01:16:27.210 --> 01:16:31.750
Just go to the shopping: the husband gives
the money to the wife to buy some shirts and

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:38.750
she comes out with some three, four funny
punk dresses which will be discarded after

01:16:41.190 --> 01:16:47.980
three, four months. We play into the hands
of entrepreneurs all the time. Entrepreneurs

01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:52.130
start some sort of a funny dress: all right,
everybody must dress up like that. We have

01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:58.110
our own intelligence, we have our own personality!
We have no individuality left; everybody must

01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:59.450
dress up the same way.

01:16:59.450 --> 01:17:06.070
Now, I should say that we must put some oil
in our head at least the day we want to wash

01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:13.070
our hair, because we’ll all become bald
and then these entrepreneurs will sell us

01:17:13.070 --> 01:17:19.290
the wigs. That’s the trick! So now the fashion
is not to put oil – all right, don’t put

01:17:19.290 --> 01:17:25.270
oil; but at least before washing your hair
you can put some oil in your head. You see,

01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:29.750
this is what I am saying: the wisdom part
is not there and the balance is not there,

01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:36.750
and because of that we are getting into trouble.
All kinds of venturesome things have started,

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:44.560
like the Grand Prix. Now, the man must die
in the Grand Prix, otherwise it’s not a

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:48.100
good one – that’s what they say, exactly.

01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:53.400
So this sensationalisation – must have sensations,
as if we have become numbed people: absolutely

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:58.830
we have no sensitivity to feel any joy or
happiness, so we have to be given injections

01:17:58.830 --> 01:18:05.560
all the time, like electric shocks. To Me
all these things, this looks so shocking.

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:09.810
And I’ll tell you tomorrow what happens
to you when you get into all these shocks.

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:16.810
This is what happens, that you develop blood
cancer. Cancer is created by us, by our imbalance,

01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:26.950
by our insanity. We have to become sane people.
We must respect ourselves. Perhaps we have

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:34.810
had no identity so far, that’s why we are
like this. But once you are realized, you

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:41.810
know your identity and then you enjoy yourself,
you respect yourself. And don’t waste your

01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:46.340
time in useless things, destroying yourself.

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:53.340
Yes? I, I tell you now, you see, the time
is coming up much more, so one question will

01:18:55.730 --> 01:19:02.730
do. Now who will withdraw? …. All right,
one lady waiting. Who is that one? This one?

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:20.700
…. What is it? …. What?

01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:27.700
[Question: The spirit. Does the spirit discriminate
between good and evil, love and hate, or does

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:31.970
it just react?]

01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:38.970
Spirit is the source of knowledge, absolute
knowledge; is the source of peace, is the

01:19:44.190 --> 01:19:51.190
source of wisdom, is the source of joy, is
the source that enlightens our attention.

01:19:59.190 --> 01:20:06.190
We have such a big property with us. We should
allow it to enlighten us, shouldn’t we?

01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:16.880
Now I think we should stop the questions,
because there’s one thing: I’m quite good

01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:24.020
at answering questions. I’ll answer all
your questions, but by that I cannot guarantee

01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:32.840
your realization. I can answer most of your
questions, but I can’t guarantee your realization.

01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:38.660
Realization has to work out. So even if you
have not been able to ask some question, forget

01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:45.660
it. You can bring them tomorrow written down,
and I would like to answer them when you come

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:51.540
tomorrow. Beforehand if you give, I’ll answer
them. But just now I think, tell your mind

01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:55.670
not to bother you any more about questions.
And that’s why I wanted you to ask questions,

01:20:55.670 --> 01:21:00.460
so that your mind should not suddenly come
out like jack-in-the-box and say, “Oh, you

01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:07.460
didn’t ask this question. How can you have
realization?” So the most important thing

01:21:08.710 --> 01:21:13.490
is to get your realization.

01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:20.490
So I think, let us have it now. Again, I cannot
force on you. You have to have it in your

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:28.460
free will. So please, those who want to have
should be there. It will take hardly ten minutes

01:21:29.670 --> 01:21:36.670
to work it out, and then tomorrow again I’m
going to work it out. It’s very simple,

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:44.960
very easy. But those who don’t want to have
it should not be in the hall. It’s not proper,

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:50.690
it’s not civil. So all those who want to
have it, are welcome.

01:21:50.690 --> 01:21:57.690
At the very outset, at the very outset there
are two conditions I have to tell you. First

01:22:09.170 --> 01:22:16.170
one, as I told you before also, you have to
forget the past. You have to forgive yourself,

01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:25.160
and know that you are not guilty at all. All
these ideas are given to you that you are

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:32.160
sinful, you are guilty, you are this and that
because they wanted to cash it. You don’t

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:41.800
have to suffer either. So first of all you
should know that you must forgive yourself

01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:50.750
and must have self-esteem and you should be
very pleasantly placed towards yourself, because

01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:57.750
you are going to enter into the Kingdom of
God. This is the first condition.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:06.440
Now the second condition is that you have
to forgive everyone. Some will say it’s

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:15.850
very difficult to forgive. But whether you
forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do

01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:23.190
anything. It’s a myth. But if you don’t
forgive then you really play into the hands

01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:28.650
of the people who want to torture you. So
best is to forgive them, forget about them.

01:23:28.650 --> 01:23:34.200
Forgive and forget. But don’t start counting
how many people I have to forgive, what mistakes

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:40.140
they have done – nothing of the kind. Just
in general say “I forgive everyone” – just,

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:46.500
and it’s done. Because Divine is the ocean
of forgiveness, it’s a very powerful ocean

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:53.500
of forgiveness, and you cannot do anything
that it cannot forgive. And once you say “I

01:23:53.670 --> 01:24:00.670
forgive,” Divine takes over; we don’t
have to bother. All right? These are the two

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:08.610
conditions we have; very simple conditions,
I think. We have to take out our shoes to

01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:15.610
take the help of the Mother Earth. That’s
very important.

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:28.760
(It’s supposed to be .… Too much for the
throat, talking all the time. All right.)

01:24:58.130 --> 01:25:05.130
Now …. (It’s all right.) You have to put
both your feet apart from each other, because

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:12.710
as I told you there are two powers. A little
apart from each other, not touching. And you

01:25:12.710 --> 01:25:18.960
have to be comfortable. If there’s something
tight you can release it a little bit. You

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:25.920
need not bend down or stretch yourself too
much. Just in a normal way you sit down. Put

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:32.920
no strain on your body. You have to put your
left hand towards Me like this, in a comfortable

01:25:34.890 --> 01:25:41.890
way, on your – you can keep it on your lap,
whatever is comfortable. Now this represents

01:25:43.810 --> 01:25:49.280
that you desire to have your realization.
So you keep it all the time like this. And

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:56.280
with the right hand we’ll nourish our centers.
With the right hand we will nourish our centers.

01:25:58.150 --> 01:26:04.730
And so you will know also how to raise your
kundalini yourself. So two things can be done:

01:26:04.730 --> 01:26:11.730
your kundalini will be raised; as well as
you will feel, you will know how to feel your

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:19.560
centers within yourself and how to correct
them. We’ll be working only on the left-hand

01:26:19.560 --> 01:26:26.560
side. So now you have to put the left hand
towards Me. First I’ll show you, he will

01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:34.770
show you what is to be done, and then you’ll
have to close your eyes later on.

01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:45.620
First we’ll put our hand on our heart. In
the heart resides the spirit. Then we’ll

01:26:53.970 --> 01:27:00.970
have to put our hand on the upper portion
of our abdomen, on the left-hand side. This

01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:09.520
is the center of your mastery, created by
great masters. Then you have to take your

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:16.850
right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen
on the left-hand side, which is a very important

01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:23.850
center which manifests this pure knowledge
on your central nervous system. Then you have

01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:40.540
to raise your hand higher, again on to the
left side of your abdomen, on the upper part.

01:27:42.290 --> 01:27:49.290
Press it hard, on the center of mastery. Then
to your heart again. And then on to the corner

01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:02.280
between your neck and your shoulder – from
the front side, not from the back but from

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:08.910
the front side – and turn your head to your
right. Now this center is very important,

01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:15.380
because this catches on very much, specially
in the West, because people all the time feel

01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:22.380
guilty. And because of this people get spondylitis
and angina and all other lethargic organs

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:30.240
diseases. So please put your hand here, as
far back as possible, and turn your head to

01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:33.230
your right.

01:28:33.230 --> 01:28:40.230
Now, take your right hand and put it on your
forehead across and try to put your head down

01:28:44.490 --> 01:28:51.490
slowly, resting on this hand. And now press
it on both the sides, as we do it when we

01:28:57.930 --> 01:29:04.930
have headache. This is the center for forgiving
others. Then you have to take down your hand,

01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:11.740
take up your hand onto the back side of your
head where the optic lobe is, here at the

01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:18.740
back. And now turn your head upward as far
as possible, resting on your hand. This is

01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:27.670
the center where you have to ask for forgiveness
from the Divine without feeling guilty – is

01:29:27.670 --> 01:29:34.670
for your satisfaction. Now, stretch your hand,
stretch your palm and put the center of your

01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:44.030
palm just on top of the fontanel bone area,
which was the soft bone in your childhood.

01:29:45.610 --> 01:29:52.610
And now bend your head, please, downward as
much as possible. Push back your fingers,

01:29:55.570 --> 01:30:02.570
push back as much as possible. Now there will
be a pressure on the scalp. Now move this

01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:10.070
pressure on the scalp slowly clockwise, seven
times. You have to move the scalp, not your

01:30:10.450 --> 01:30:17.450
hand so much as the scalp, seven times clockwise,
slowly. Bend your head.

01:30:20.670 --> 01:30:27.670
That’s what we’ll have to do. That’s
all, nothing more. That’s the only thing

01:30:33.930 --> 01:30:40.340
we have to do. Now, you can take out your
spectacles if you want because you’re closing

01:30:40.340 --> 01:30:46.470
your eyes, and might help your eyesight also.

01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:53.470
Now, put your left hand towards Me, comfortably.
Put your feet apart from each other. And now

01:30:56.900 --> 01:31:03.900
put your right hand on your heart and close
your eyes. Here you have to ask Me a very

01:31:12.210 --> 01:31:19.210
important question, in your heart. You ask
Me a question as you would ask a computer.

01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:26.910
You can call Me “Shri Mataji” or “Mother”,
whatever you like. “Mother, am I the spirit?”

01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:35.800
Ask the question, in your heart, not loudly.
Three times ask in your heart, not loudly,

01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:42.800
“Mother, am I the spirit?” You have to
only ask in your heart.

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:58.780
If you are the spirit you become your own
guide, you become your own master, you become

01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:05.780
your own guru. So now take down your right
hand into the upper portion of your abdomen

01:32:08.090 --> 01:32:15.090
on the left-hand side. And here you have to
ask another question, three times, not loudly,

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:29.500
in your heart, “Mother, am I the spirit?”
– ah! “Mother, am I my own master? Mother,

01:32:30.570 --> 01:32:37.570
am I my own master?” Ask this question three
times. “Am I my own master?”

01:32:55.770 --> 01:33:02.770
I have told you that I respect your freedom,
and the pure knowledge cannot be forced on

01:33:08.610 --> 01:33:15.610
you. So please take your right hand in the
lower portion of your abdomen, and say it

01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:27.510
six times, asking Me, “Mother, please give
me pure knowledge.” I cannot force on you.

01:33:30.430 --> 01:33:37.430
You have to ask in your free will.

01:33:40.230 --> 01:33:47.230
As soon as you ask for the pure knowledge,
the kundalini starts moving upward.

01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:07.430
So now we have to nourish the higher centers
with our self-confidence. Raise your right

01:34:14.210 --> 01:34:21.210
hand in the upper portion of your abdomen.
Press it hard, on the left-hand side. And

01:34:27.170 --> 01:34:34.170
here with full confidence you have to say
ten times, in your heart, not loudly, “Mother,

01:34:36.190 --> 01:34:43.190
I am my own master.” Please say this ten
times, “Mother, I am my own master.”

01:35:05.170 --> 01:35:12.170
I told you at the very outset that the greatest
truth about you is that you are not this body,

01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:19.760
you are not this mind, you are not these conditionings,
emotions, nor this ego, but you are the spirit.

01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:29.860
You are the pure spirit. So now raise your
right hand onto your heart and ask here, or

01:35:43.930 --> 01:35:50.930
say with full confidence, twelve times, “Mother,
I am the spirit.” Just say it without any

01:35:55.510 --> 01:36:02.510
hesitation. Say it twelve times, please.

01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:19.960
For your information you have to know that
the divine Power is the source of knowledge,

01:36:29.890 --> 01:36:36.890
is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of
love. It is the ocean of peace and ocean of

01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:50.430
bliss. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.
So you cannot commit any mistake which cannot

01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:59.870
be dissolved by the power of this ocean of
forgiveness. So please raise your right hand

01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:07.900
in the corner of your neck, on your shoulder,
push it back as much as possible and turn

01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:16.260
your head to your right, and with full confidence
please say sixteen times, full confidence,

01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:27.840
in your heart, “Mother, I am not guilty
at all.”

01:37:38.970 --> 01:37:45.970
All right. As I told you before that you have
to forgive everyone, and those who say it

01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:02.470
is difficult, they must know that it is a
myth whether you forgive or don’t forgive.

01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:09.470
But if you don’t forgive then you play into
the wrong hands and get yourself tortured

01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:16.120
by yourself. So please forgive – in general,
everyone, not counting how many people you

01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:22.000
have to forgive, what you have to forgive
– but just say, by raising your hand and

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:29.000
putting it on top of your forehead across,
putting down your head as much as possible,

01:38:30.060 --> 01:38:37.060
resting on your hand. Please say, with an
open heart please say, “Mother, I forgive

01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:51.550
everyone.” Please say it, please say; otherwise
it is difficult later on for Me: I have to

01:38:58.070 --> 01:39:04.570
clear out everybody’s Agnya and this takes
too much time then. So best is to say it from

01:39:04.570 --> 01:39:11.570
your heart. After all, you are not going to
miss your Self-realization for that.

01:39:14.110 --> 01:39:21.110
Now take back your right hand on the back
side of your head, and put your head on it,

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:32.600
resting on it, upward. Here you have to say
for your own satisfaction, “Oh Divine, if

01:39:36.180 --> 01:39:42.660
I have done any mistakes, please forgive me.”
But don’t feel guilty, don’t count your

01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:47.780
mistakes, don’t think about them. In general
you have to say, “Oh Divine, please forgive

01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:54.780
me if I have done any mistakes or anything
wrong, anything against You.”

01:39:59.810 --> 01:40:06.810
Now, stretch your palm, stretch your palm
and put the center of your palm on top of

01:40:08.910 --> 01:40:15.910
the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone
in your childhood. Now put down your head

01:40:16.989 --> 01:40:23.989
properly. And here push back your fingers
as far as possible. Please push back. This

01:40:27.190 --> 01:40:34.190
is very important. And now put a pressure
on your scalp, and move your scalp slowly

01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:41.840
seven times clockwise. Here again I respect
your freedom, and I cannot force Self-realization

01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:52.050
on you. So here you have to say seven times,
bending your head properly and pressing it

01:40:52.830 --> 01:40:59.280
hard, moving seven times, “Mother, please
give me my Self-realization.” Please ask

01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:01.580
seven times, please.

01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:08.580
[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.]

01:41:29.170 --> 01:41:36.170
Now, take down your hands and put them towards
Me, little higher. Now, little bit put your

01:42:08.130 --> 01:42:15.130
right hand like this. Bend your head, and
see for yourself if there is a cool breeze

01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:22.500
coming out of your head. But don’t touch
it – above your head, above your head. And

01:42:24.530 --> 01:42:31.360
some people get it far. So just try to feel
if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your

01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:38.280
head. Now, don’t start doubting that it’s
air-conditioning and all that – air-conditioning

01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:45.280
cannot come out of your head! So see for yourself.
Now, put
your left hand towards Me. Now again bend

01:42:55.050 --> 01:43:02.050
your head, and see for yourself if there’s
a cool breeze coming out of your head. All

01:43:10.650 --> 01:43:17.650
right? Now put your right hand again, and
again bend your head and see for yourself

01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:25.620
if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your
head. It might be hot also, doesn’t matter.

01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:32.480
It may be heat coming out first and then the
cool breeze. Doesn’t matter if it is hot,

01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:34.890
doesn’t matter.

01:43:34.890 --> 01:43:41.890
Now, put your both the hands towards the sky
like this. Bend back, and ask Me a question.

01:43:46.370 --> 01:43:52.920
Three times, you can ask Me the question,
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:59.920
Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the all-pervading
Power of divine love? Mother, is this the

01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:09.280
Paramachaitanya?” Ask any one of these questions
three times.

01:44:15.170 --> 01:44:22.170
Now put down your hands. Now watch Me without
thinking. You can do it. Those who have felt

01:44:30.750 --> 01:44:37.750
the cool breeze in their hands or out of their
fontanel bone area, whether cool or hot, please

01:44:39.660 --> 01:44:46.660
raise both your hands – both. Let’s see.
Just see the en masse, just see – wonderful!

01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:54.220
So may God bless you all.

01:44:54.220 --> 01:45:01.220
I bow to you all, because you have started
now your saintly life. And all those who didn’t

01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:08.720
get also should not get disappointed. On the
contrary, if time permits I would like to

01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:14.880
meet the people who have felt the cool breeze,
and those who haven’t felt can come on this

01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:20.980
side and the Sahaja yogis can work on them.
Again tomorrow you must come so you’ll be

01:45:20.980 --> 01:45:25.980
fixed properly. Some, those who want to meet
Me can come and see Me, because there is some

01:45:25.980 --> 01:45:32.980
time, and in the meanwhile we can have some
music. Now don’t think about it. If you

01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:40.210
start thinking, you’ll be lost. Just don’t
think about it; it’s beyond thinking.

01:45:40.210 --> 01:45:46.840
Thank you very much. Thank you. Beautiful!
Oh, My! Thank you. It’s beautiful flowers.

01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:51.489
If you can push this apart, I’d like to
meet people.

01:45:51.489 --> 01:45:51.920
[Bhajans]
