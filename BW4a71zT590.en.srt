00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,530
TC from Amruta 21-12-2016

3
00:00:01,286 --> 00:00:05,992
I see in My own country when they were fighting for freedom,

4
00:00:07,302 --> 00:00:10,414
My father himself gave up all his property,

5
00:00:10,534 --> 00:00:16,724
gave up his practice, with eleven children in the family.

6
00:00:16,844 --> 00:00:21,641
And we were living in palaces, started living in huts,

7
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:24,471
for days together, for years together.

8
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:28,475
But for the gross freedom we'll do anything,

9
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:30,763
but for the subtler freedom

10
00:00:30,883 --> 00:00:34,886
the Sahaja Yogis have to do everything that is possible.

11
00:00:35,006 --> 00:00:39,144
So, the first thing is to realize, to be aware,

12
00:00:39,264 --> 00:00:44,368
to be in your conscious mind all the time that you are yogis.

13
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:49,012
You are the ones who are very much higher

14
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:52,397
than the rest of the humanity.

15
00:00:52,517 --> 00:00:59,276
That the salvation of the whole of humanity depends on you.

16
00:00:59,396 --> 00:01:04,461
The purpose of creation will be served by you.

17
00:01:04,581 --> 00:01:06,980
So, first of all you have to be conscious

18
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,521
in your consciousness that you are so important,

19
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:14,961
and that's why you were given Realization.

20
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:18,270
How can you be living with your conditionings

21
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,349
and with your ego?

22
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:22,385
The conditionings are like this:

23
00:01:22,506 --> 00:01:25,332
Supposing you are coming from a Christian religion,

24
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,556
then you must bring that

25
00:01:27,676 --> 00:01:30,567
little bit of that religion into Sahaja Yoga.

26
00:01:30,687 --> 00:01:32,704
Or if you are from a Hindu religion,

27
00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:35,255
you want to bring some out of that.

28
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:39,486
We have all the essences of these in Sahaja Yoga,

29
00:01:39,607 --> 00:01:44,233
the pure essences; but we can't have the gross nonsense.

30
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:52,261
All these things are like dirt over

31
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:56,892
our Sahasrara which must be shaken off.

32
00:01:57,012 --> 00:01:59,388
Though now you are aware,

33
00:01:59,508 --> 00:02:04,474
you are aware and conscious of your chakras,

34
00:02:04,594 --> 00:02:07,844
you do not keep them clean.

35
00:02:08,914 --> 00:02:11,188
Ordinary human beings if they have clothes,

36
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:14,897
they have houses, they try to keep them clean.

37
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:17,499
But you do not feel ashamed of them

38
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:20,563
also when they are bad,

39
00:02:21,127 --> 00:02:23,566
because after some time

40
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:27,156
you also loose the awareness of them.

41
00:02:27,276 --> 00:02:30,733
That means you have become subtler,

42
00:02:30,853 --> 00:02:36,405
but in your consciousness you are not yet subtle.

43
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:42,063
There are so many things you know more

44
00:02:42,443 --> 00:02:47,190
than the people who are not realized,

45
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:50,881
as absolute reality.

46
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,345
For example: We don't even use vibrations.

47
00:02:56,147 --> 00:02:59,058
Whenever it is needed, we don't use it.

48
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:03,251
Or sometimes mechanically, just like a machine,

49
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:06,342
we start giving bandhans.

50
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:11,652
So you are still unconscious about your chakras.

51
00:03:11,772 --> 00:03:14,790
Slightly conscious when you put your mind to it,

52
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,269
otherwise, in your central nervous system

53
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:19,864
you are not yet so conscious.

54
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:23,694
This is the reason, why you do not know

55
00:03:24,392 --> 00:03:31,700
why you had to do a thing at a particular time.

56
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,825
Unless and until you rise to this Nirvikalpa state,

57
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:39,312
you cannot go further.

58
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:44,134
For example, I know everything what I do.

59
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:49,266
I can handle any power whenever I want to.

60
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:53,035
I can absorb any negativity I want to,

61
00:03:53,155 --> 00:03:57,491
I need not absorb any negativity I don't want to.

62
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:00,406
You may be thousands of miles away from Me,

63
00:04:00,526 --> 00:04:03,950
I know about everyone of you.

64
00:04:04,071 --> 00:04:07,343
I may not know your worldly names,

65
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:12,545
but I know you as a part and parcel in My Being.

66
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:17,741
I also can behave like a human being,

67
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:21,102
absolutely like you, aging like you,

68
00:04:21,222 --> 00:04:24,154
even using spectacles,

69
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:33,035
doing all the things that will make Me a complete human being.

70
00:04:33,155 --> 00:04:38,088
I have accepted this role consciously,

71
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:41,465
not unconsciously.

72
00:04:41,735 --> 00:04:44,992
To Me, nothing is unconscious.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,521
So if you have to be conscious of what you are doing,

74
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:56,164
you have to be alert about it.

75
00:04:56,284 --> 00:05:00,929
The first thing that you have achieved is the peace,

76
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:02,421
the peace.

77
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:06,007
But even now I find that peace

78
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:10,289
which would become joy becomes the quarrel.

79
00:05:10,409 --> 00:05:14,239
Truth is one, you cannot argue about truth.

80
00:05:14,359 --> 00:05:17,172
It is a homogenous thing.

81
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:21,102
It doesn't quarrel with each other.

82
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:24,694
We are unconscious about our fingers,

83
00:05:24,814 --> 00:05:26,666
but when we have to hold something,

84
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:28,769
all of them come togethe.

85
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:33,464
So the part of the brain, which is working this out,

86
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:38,724
the unconscious part of it, is to be made conscious.

87
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:42,012
That is what evolution is.

88
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:51,849
So now adherence to any concept is against evolution.

89
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:55,591
You must learn to face the reality,

90
00:05:55,711 --> 00:06:02,452
to accept the reality and act in a real way.

91
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:05,874
Now you may say, "Mother, this is a miracle."

92
00:06:05,994 --> 00:06:08,496
Something happens, "this is a miracle."

93
00:06:08,616 --> 00:06:11,546
Maybe for the human beings,

94
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:14,152
maybe for Sahaja Yogis also,

95
00:06:14,272 --> 00:06:16,423
but not for Me

96
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,554
because I know what it is.

97
00:06:20,237 --> 00:06:27,829
So to rise above this half-baked consciousness,

98
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:35,165
one has to see how you are working it out.

99
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:39,526
The whole system of relating to

100
00:06:39,646 --> 00:06:42,785
each other must change completely.

101
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:46,852
That is very important, at least for western people.

102
00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:50,173
Because at least in India people know

103
00:06:50,293 --> 00:06:53,154
that human efforts lead you nowhere,

104
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:56,005
you have to take to your ascent -

105
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,778
I mean the real Indians.

106
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:02,083
Some of them do take advantage of Sahaja Yoga

107
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:06,292
and then disappear, some of them do.

108
00:07:06,412 --> 00:07:10,615
But mostly they know that you have to be

109
00:07:10,735 --> 00:07:15,864
conscious of what you have got.

110
00:07:15,984 --> 00:07:21,397
So, we can say that we have got self-knowledge,

111
00:07:21,517 --> 00:07:24,654
but we haven't got self-consciousness.

112
00:07:24,774 --> 00:07:27,427
Now, for example, you take somebody's name,

113
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,668
say of some great saint.

114
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:34,402
You feel the vibrations are flowing.

115
00:07:34,522 --> 00:07:39,391
Also you know why - because he is a saint.

116
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:42,109
But why not you the Sahaja Yogis?

117
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:46,041
If your names are taken, why don't the vibrations flow?

118
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:50,491
And in this you have greater advantages

119
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:53,676
because the Adi Shakti, Herself, is before you.

120
00:07:53,796 --> 00:07:57,394
They didn't have anybody to tell them all these things.

121
00:07:57,514 --> 00:08:03,311
But the disadvantage of that is this: that you take it for granted.

122
00:08:03,685 --> 00:08:09,782
Now, in expression, when we say something,

123
00:08:09,902 --> 00:08:12,904
when we express; are we natural,

124
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:16,178
are we it doing from our heart?

125
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:21,323
The consciousness that "I'm doing it from my heart,"

126
00:08:21,443 --> 00:08:24,218
is what I want you to achieve.

127
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:28,145
Like there are people who work very hard in Sahaja Yoga,

128
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:31,005
others will just take it for granted.

129
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:33,809
They do not want to help.

130
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:37,852
They want everything to be ready-made.

131
00:08:37,972 --> 00:08:40,386
That shows that they are not conscious

132
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:43,880
of their own powers of enjoyment.

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,509
If they do it from their heart,

134
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:54,001
then they will never feel what effort they have put in,

135
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:58,699
they will only feel what they have been blessed with

136
00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:00,524
or what they have achieved.

137
00:09:00,644 --> 00:09:03,120
Now the second stage would be

138
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,886
where you will be conscious of whatever you are doing,

139
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:11,397
where there will be no mistakes.

140
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:13,812
Whatever you will do

141
00:09:13,932 --> 00:09:16,911
may appear to be a mistake will turn out to be all right.

142
00:09:17,031 --> 00:09:19,946
Nobody is so far like that, so I would like to tell you.

143
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:23,918
Because some people do feel whatever I say of praising,

144
00:09:24,045 --> 00:09:26,298
they think I'm saying it to them.

145
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:30,609
Now for example, today I had My watch,

146
00:09:30,729 --> 00:09:34,913
I wanted to set My watch, so I pulled this screw up,

147
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:37,067
say, simple thing.

148
00:09:37,187 --> 00:09:40,287
Now this I did, I would say, in a way unconsciously,

149
00:09:40,407 --> 00:09:42,614
but quite consciously.

150
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:48,469
Because the watch stopped and I knew the time,

151
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,782
what time I have to be there for puja.

152
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:55,983
So consciously I put Myself against Myself.

153
00:09:56,103 --> 00:10:01,798
If the watch had not stopped, I would have come earlier.

154
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:05,409
But that was not the time I had to come.

155
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:10,111
So I had to pull the screw to keep it stopped.

156
00:10:10,231 --> 00:10:13,709
So whatever mischief you play,

157
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:17,284
you know and you can play it against yourself also.

158
00:10:17,404 --> 00:10:20,113
And then you can make a drama.

159
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:25,022
"Oh, I made a mistake!" and things like that, for nothing at all.

160
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:28,814
But such a stage is far off. I must tell you.

161
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:33,338
Just now the stage at which we are,

162
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:36,060
we are still making lots of mistakes

163
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,373
because we are not Self-conscious.

164
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:43,455
In a gross way we understand this word self-consciousness like this:

165
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:45,836
When a person has to go for an interview

166
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:47,938
then, he selects his suit properly,

167
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:50,219
he'll comb his hair properly before going,

168
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:54,793
he'll clear his throat. Self-conscious.

169
00:10:55,134 --> 00:10:58,060
But when it is the question of your ascent,

170
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:01,912
are we alert? Or we are taking it for granted

171
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:05,249
that Mother is just now going to give us a nice bath,

172
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:08,556
put us in the cradle and take us there.

173
00:11:08,676 --> 00:11:12,765
You have to mature in your ascent.

174
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:16,252
Now you may say, "What should we do?"

175
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:20,406
Face yourself every day!

176
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:25,157
In reality, see how much time you spend about

177
00:11:25,277 --> 00:11:30,186
mundane worries and how much about your ascent.

178
00:11:30,306 --> 00:11:36,576
Have you left everything, all your worries to God Almighty?

179
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:41,629
Have you completely jumped out of your background?

180
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:50,136
Have you come out all the way, leaving everything that was nonsensical?

181
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:54,326
And how do I relate to others?

182
00:11:54,446 --> 00:11:59,036
How do I talk to others who are Sahaja Yogis?

183
00:11:59,156 --> 00:12:05,383
I am surprised sometimes, if the one Sahaja Yogi is attacked

184
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,824
by a non-Sahaja Yogi that

185
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:15,062
a Sahaja Yogi group should support a non-Sahaja Yogi.

186
00:12:15,182 --> 00:12:18,439
Or a Sahaja Yogi who has to come up

187
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,172
pays more attention to the negative people

188
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:24,342
than to the positive.

189
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:27,456
He relates better to the people who are negative

190
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:30,126
than to the people who are positive.

191
00:12:30,246 --> 00:12:33,757
He is more friendly and open with the negative persons

192
00:12:33,877 --> 00:12:35,789
than with the positive.

193
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:38,121
You have to cling on to the positive.

194
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:43,623
But it's always the other way round because also is a very subtle ego in there.

195
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:48,542
All these subtle understanding

196
00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:51,203
I have told you many a time.

197
00:12:51,323 --> 00:12:56,088
But with your complicated brain, which is like a machine,

198
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,164
like a spoiled computer,

199
00:12:59,284 --> 00:13:01,977
you can reach some conclusions

200
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:07,052
out of what I have said which are just contrary.

201
00:13:07,172 --> 00:13:10,574
Like, supposing I say, "You forget the past."

202
00:13:10,694 --> 00:13:15,244
That means you forget everything that is good of the past?

203
00:13:15,364 --> 00:13:18,065
That is as if you should not understand

204
00:13:18,185 --> 00:13:20,210
why you're behaving like this?

205
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,960
Forget the past means don't allow the past to overpower you.

206
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,521
A brain, which is simple, which is straightforward,

207
00:13:31,641 --> 00:13:35,637
which has got love in it,

208
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:40,486
can understand what I am saying straightforward.

209
00:13:40,606 --> 00:13:44,371
This complicated brain is to be put right,

210
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:48,519
and the best way is to stop thinking.

211
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,447
Just stop thinking.

212
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:53,094
That's what you have to do.

213
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:59,322
Now when you stop thinking you feel that nothing can be done.

214
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:03,994
But by thinking only you don't do anything.

215
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:08,685
Now for example, I have to give you a speech now,

216
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:12,560
but I start thinking about it, what will you hear?

217
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,291
Can you hear My thinking?

218
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:21,156
You have to, say, enlighten these lights, all right?

219
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:23,866
Then you just start thinking about it,

220
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:27,271
"I have to enlighten." Will it get enlightened?

221
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:33,525
This is to be understood, that by thinking you do not do anything.

222
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:36,219
Thinking is lazy man's garb,

223
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:38,817
and is used to avoid work.

224
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:43,534
Once I asked a lady I had in the house

225
00:14:43,654 --> 00:14:49,090
that "We are going out. Will you be cooking something for us?"

226
00:14:49,574 --> 00:14:52,294
When we came back she had not cooked anything.

227
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:56,082
I used to cook every day but she had not cooked anything.

228
00:14:56,202 --> 00:15:01,560
I said, "Why? Why didn't you cook something for us?"

229
00:15:01,681 --> 00:15:05,482
She said, "I thought You may eat outside."

230
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:08,223
She was a western lady.

231
00:15:09,152 --> 00:15:13,148
So my husband said, "All right, we are going to eat outside. You stay at home."

232
00:15:13,268 --> 00:15:15,285
I said, "It doesn't look nice." He said,

233
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:19,788
"No, let her know what she thought is meant for herself."

234
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:25,638
So this is the escape which, you have learnt before,

235
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,115
the cleverness.

236
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:33,346
So you do not argue about it.

237
00:15:34,462 --> 00:15:38,159
Do not argue about Sahaja Yoga.

238
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:43,402
You do not argue with your leaders.

239
00:15:43,522 --> 00:15:46,604
You may be his wife, but don't argue.

240
00:15:46,724 --> 00:15:49,839
We are having a very bad time from some of the wives

241
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:54,811
of the leaders because they try to influence the husbands.

242
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:57,655
As far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

243
00:15:57,775 --> 00:16:00,092
they have nothing to do with that.

244
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:02,138
Supposing you are working in an office

245
00:16:02,258 --> 00:16:05,085
and the husband is some great official

246
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:09,064
and you are a clerk, will you correct the husband?

247
00:16:09,184 --> 00:16:15,774
In this case the women have to nourish the organization,

248
00:16:15,895 --> 00:16:20,273
nourish the husband with love

249
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:23,533
from their heart and not from their brains.

250
00:16:23,653 --> 00:16:30,076
I think it's so great to have been born as a woman Myself,

251
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:36,601
because I can enjoy the heart, the emotions.

252
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:40,572
The emotions of My love,

253
00:16:40,692 --> 00:16:44,577
the working and the play of My love.

254
00:16:44,697 --> 00:16:46,889
It's so great

255
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:51,926
that no incarnation can enjoy that as I can.

256
00:16:52,046 --> 00:16:54,052
So the women should not feel degraded

257
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:57,766
if they have to look after the heart,

258
00:16:57,886 --> 00:17:02,579
but they are in a higher, in a way, in a higher aspect.

259
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:06,713
You can do without thinking but you cannot do without the heart.

260
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:11,279
So the ladies should not argue

261
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:14,616
with their husbands if they are leaders,

262
00:17:14,736 --> 00:17:18,208
and also one should not argue otherwise, also.

263
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:22,118
Because I have seen if the women are very argumentative,

264
00:17:22,238 --> 00:17:24,539
the men become deaf.

265
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:28,417
They just don't listen what women are talking.

266
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:31,184
If they are very aggressive, then the men

267
00:17:31,304 --> 00:17:35,494
become absolutely shut up.

268
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:39,176
So in relationship with each other,

269
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:42,448
you must behave in a natural way that

270
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:44,742
you are a man and you are a woman.

271
00:17:44,862 --> 00:17:48,034
You should become more a woman and more a man

272
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:50,339
and then you will see the fun.

273
00:17:50,459 --> 00:17:53,365
Imagine in this world if there were only men or only women,

274
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:56,880
what would have happened?

275
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:05,534
So we have to know that in our awareness

276
00:18:05,654 --> 00:18:10,883
we have to be conscious how far we have achieved

277
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:18,858
the consciousness for our relationship with each other,

278
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:25,351
that is the collective consciousness of Virat, of the brain,

279
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,688
that is of Sahasrara.

280
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:34,200
So in principle Sahasrara is Vishnu Tattwa,

281
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:39,333
but the Deity is Mataji Nirmala Devi.

282
00:18:39,705 --> 00:18:46,309
So you can see how the beautiful integration has taken place.

283
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:50,244
All the powers of Shri Vishnu have to act

284
00:18:50,364 --> 00:18:55,802
according to the Deity, surrendered at the Lotus Feet of the Deity.

285
00:18:55,922 --> 00:19:00,548
So the consciousness of Shri Vishnu is

286
00:19:00,668 --> 00:19:05,518
absolutely in the hands of the Deity.

287
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:11,550
I do not want to talk about this tremendous Deity,

288
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:18,358
it's too much, because it may fill you up with awe.

289
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:31,293
So, whatever is working out, allow it to work out.

290
00:19:31,413 --> 00:19:35,939
They say, "Surrender your Sahasrara to this Deity."

291
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:39,834
And it's so, so simple for you,

292
00:19:39,954 --> 00:19:44,172
because you have the Deity,

293
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:49,122
you have your own Sahasrara, and it's only you,

294
00:19:49,242 --> 00:19:53,444
the people who are Sahaja Yogis today in modern times,

295
00:19:53,564 --> 00:19:56,153
have seen that Deity.

296
00:19:56,273 --> 00:19:59,747
They say that you have to ask for three things

297
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:03,399
called salokya, samipya, sanidhya from God;

298
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:08,766
meaning to see God, salokya;

299
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:12,019
samipya, the closeness with God

300
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:16,716
and sanidhya is the companionship of God.

301
00:20:16,836 --> 00:20:21,330
But you have got tadatmya, is oneness with God

302
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:24,840
which is not in the concept of any one

303
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:29,736
of the yogis and the saints and the seers who have been before.

304
00:20:29,856 --> 00:20:34,933
And this tadatmya you have when you are outside My body,

305
00:20:35,053 --> 00:20:38,659
while they have this tadatmya when they are inside My body,

306
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,360
they are no more.

307
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,437
Now, So you should understand the time limit.

308
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:49,367
You must understand your greatness

309
00:20:49,487 --> 00:20:54,610
and you must understand how you people

310
00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:02,929
are chosen for the highest work in this creation.

311
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:06,186
So now there's no time for lethargy.

312
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:10,737
Now you have to rise and awake.

313
00:21:10,857 --> 00:21:14,602
Today is the day when I hope

314
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:18,049
you have to jump into Nirvikalpa.

315
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:20,441
But only by effort you will stay there,

316
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:22,824
otherwise you will again slip down.

317
00:21:22,944 --> 00:21:25,558
So go through this lecture again and again,

318
00:21:25,678 --> 00:21:28,551
and do not think about it.

319
00:21:28,671 --> 00:21:33,422
Don't think that it is for somebody else, it is for you.

320
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,597
For all of you,

321
00:21:35,717 --> 00:21:38,244
each of you,

322
00:21:38,736 --> 00:21:41,432
and you must know yourself

323
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:46,147
how far you are going every day.

324
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:53,931
Today is a special day of Sahasrara.

325
00:21:56,121 --> 00:22:00,929
Actually, if you see, it is according to

326
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:04,820
the sun calendar,

327
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,991
Sahasrara would have been tomorrow.

328
00:22:08,111 --> 00:22:12,249
It is a Monday, which is the Sahasrara

329
00:22:13,884 --> 00:22:19,876
and just imagine that we are having it one day earlier.

330
00:22:19,997 --> 00:22:26,693
So one has to know that the calendar of God

331
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:31,633
has nothing to do with the human calendar.

332
00:22:32,054 --> 00:22:34,646
According to certain calendars,

333
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:39,429
I should have come two thousand years later

334
00:22:47,063 --> 00:22:49,362
and some think I should have come

335
00:22:49,482 --> 00:22:52,943
at least two thousand years back,

336
00:22:53,063 --> 00:22:54,896
in this form.

337
00:22:55,017 --> 00:23:01,404
So the calendar is all right, timing is all right,

338
00:23:01,525 --> 00:23:03,819
everything is all right.

339
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:09,920
You are not robots, you are not machines,

340
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:16,819
you are evolved through the evolutionary process.

341
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:21,044
And through evolutionary process only

342
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:24,708
you have to achieve the higher.

343
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:30,451
So whatever we may do or whatever may be all right,

344
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:36,814
it's you who have to show the results.

345
00:23:36,934 --> 00:23:44,030
We may take your Sahasrara

346
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:48,926
to a great enlightenment but again it will collapse.

347
00:23:49,046 --> 00:23:54,325
So you have to know that whatever heights

348
00:23:54,445 --> 00:23:59,544
you are brought to, it is you who have to maintain it

349
00:23:59,664 --> 00:24:04,162
with full will power and action.

350
00:24:08,824 --> 00:24:11,023
May God bless you!
