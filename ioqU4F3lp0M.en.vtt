00:02.671 --> 00:17.413
I welcome all the sahaja yogis from abroad
to this great country of yoga.

00:22.468 --> 00:28.674
It gives me immense pleasure; I have
no words to express,

00:28.699 --> 00:37.026
to see sahaja yogis coming from
all over the world,

00:37.051 --> 00:45.619
all over the country to celebrate this
special occasion today.

00:48.223 --> 00:54.938
It’s so auspicious today that you all
should be here;

00:54.963 --> 01:02.678
because you are the chosen ones,
the soldiers

01:03.797 --> 01:15.157
who are going to fight till Satya Yuga
is established on this earth.

01:16.725 --> 01:20.145
Is the day of revolution.

01:20.769 --> 01:26.700
San-krant means: san means, you know,
auspicious, krant means revolution.

01:26.725 --> 01:30.949
Today is the day of holy revolution.

01:30.974 --> 01:37.831
I’ve told you about the rebellion that
in rebellion we move in a pendulum

01:37.856 --> 01:45.835
from one to another end as a result
of inertia.

01:46.772 --> 01:51.395
But through the ascent,

01:54.771 --> 02:01.809
when we achieve a higher state, it’s only
possible when there is a revolution

02:01.834 --> 02:07.115
and revolution takes spirally. The movement
has to be spiral

02:07.140 --> 02:12.536
to land up at a higher position.
So this is the revolution

02:12.561 --> 02:15.525
which is the holy revolution.

02:15.550 --> 02:22.688
We have known of many revolutions so far;
we have had revolutions in our country.

02:22.713 --> 02:27.027
In other western countries also we have
had revolution

02:27.052 --> 02:35.432
on the political grounds, on the grounds
of disparities.

02:35.457 --> 02:41.224
Many other things have been fought
through revolution,

02:41.249 --> 02:48.550
but still, the ascent has not been
achieved within.

02:48.575 --> 02:55.377
I am talking about the revolution
within ourselves.

02:55.402 --> 03:03.845
In this revolution you are very much helped
by your own Mother, the Kundalini,

03:03.870 --> 03:11.747
and you evolve in a very sweet manner;

03:11.772 --> 03:19.830
in a spiral ascent to land up as realized
souls.

03:21.603 --> 03:28.133
You have been very kind to come to this
country

03:28.158 --> 03:32.869
because this country does not have
the comforts

03:32.894 --> 03:37.601
and the facilities you have in your
own country;

03:37.626 --> 03:42.141
so one has to be prepared for
the roughing out,

03:42.166 --> 03:46.733
which may be difficult for some people
to do so.

03:46.758 --> 03:52.040
I had to buy a present for some gentleman
when I came to Bombay

03:52.065 --> 03:56.786
and I thought what should I buy? I’d better
go and buy some ivory piece for him.

03:56.811 --> 04:01.189
So I went to the shop, and I got
a beautiful ivory piece

04:01.214 --> 04:08.200
called hitopadesh where Shri Krishna
is sitting on a beautiful chariot of ivory

04:08.225 --> 04:19.043
and giving the hitopadesh, the sermon
of Gita to Arjuna.

04:19.068 --> 04:24.959
It was very easy to buy; it took only half
an hour for me to go and buy the thing.

04:24.984 --> 04:31.296
But to buy the wrapping paper I had
to waste two hours in Bombay.

04:31.321 --> 04:34.634
Because you can’t get a sensible wrapping
paper here;

04:34.659 --> 04:39.730
and then the ribbon and then the flowers,
is an impossible situation.

04:39.755 --> 04:41.883
So I didn’t know what to do.

04:41.908 --> 04:46.899
I got absolutely, according to my husband,
a third class wrapping paper.

04:46.924 --> 04:51.057
I brought it back home; he said,
“You can’t wrap with this nonsense;

04:51.082 --> 04:55.992
it looks so horrid.” I said, “Now,
if you want, I can get silk to wrap it

04:56.017 --> 05:00.207
in this country, but a wrapping paper
is a problem.”

05:00.232 --> 05:03.795
So when the gentleman was presented,
I told him very frankly,

05:03.820 --> 05:07.577
"I’m sorry, in Bombay I couldn’t get
a good wrapping paper,

05:07.602 --> 05:13.137
but ivory I’ve brought for you", and he was
so enamored by the present.

05:13.162 --> 05:17.505
So in this country, you have to see that
we can get ivory,

05:17.530 --> 05:20.270
but we cannot get wrapping paper.

05:20.295 --> 05:25.332
And those who are used to wrapping paper
find it difficult to adjust

05:25.357 --> 05:29.403
because we are used to convenience
of wrapping paper.

05:29.428 --> 05:40.014
So one has to realize that the wrapping
paper, of which we are so much

05:43.505 --> 05:48.596
fond of or we are used to, is of no
importance;

05:48.621 --> 05:52.750
while you cannot get ivory in the western
countries.

05:52.775 --> 05:56.714
If you have to get an ivory piece,
I don’t know,

05:56.739 --> 05:59.869
you’ll have to move for years together
to an ivory piece,

05:59.894 --> 06:03.660
but the wrapping paper you can get it
in five minutes.

06:03.685 --> 06:08.241
So one has to realize this is a country,
if you have to know about it,

06:08.266 --> 06:12.389
you have to go deep down into it.

06:12.414 --> 06:16.586
You have to develop a deeper understanding
of this country.

06:16.611 --> 06:21.403
If you see the bathrooms and if you see
the roads, if you see the houses

06:21.428 --> 06:27.500
all black, dark, dirty, according to
all the, all the common standards of life.

06:27.525 --> 06:33.010
Forget it; forget it.

06:33.035 --> 06:37.946
You have not come here to see this, that
all you can see in your own country,

06:37.971 --> 06:43.257
and you have seen it. But what you have
come to see here is the depth,

06:43.282 --> 06:47.945
the love, the affection, the human beings.

06:49.422 --> 06:57.792
And you’ll be very happy because
you’ll find very rare experiences,

06:57.817 --> 07:05.695
which will really enthrall you with joyous
memories for all your life.

07:05.720 --> 07:13.880
Also, this country, especially Maharashtra,
is a special country

07:13.905 --> 07:19.342
because the Kundalini of the universe
resides

07:19.367 --> 07:29.613
in this triangular plane. Or we can say
this is the atta:

07:29.638 --> 07:36.526
the triangular raised platform,

07:36.551 --> 07:45.733
and hence the vibrations in this country,
this part of the country, are very great.

07:45.758 --> 07:51.721
Now, to come to for Maha Yoga, as the Sahaja
Yoga today has become Maha Yoga,

07:51.746 --> 07:57.084
you have to come to Maharashtra.
Maharashtra is the great nation.

07:57.109 --> 08:03.969
So I’m sure you are expecting lot of things
to happen to you,

08:03.994 --> 08:09.289
but keep your minds open because
it’s a revolution.

08:09.314 --> 08:16.520
It’s not just a pendulum that from comfort
you are coming to discomfort.

08:16.545 --> 08:24.451
One thing you have to realize, it has
nothing to do like an anti-culture stuff.

08:24.476 --> 08:34.793
You have come here to jump into your
subtler and subtler sensitivities;

08:34.818 --> 08:41.159
so the grosser sensitivities must be
neglected and negated

08:41.184 --> 08:47.247
so that you can feel your subtler
sensitivities.

08:47.272 --> 08:52.609
Once you start understanding this basic
principle of enjoying here,

08:52.634 --> 09:03.243
I’m sure the whole venture will be
extremely fruitful.

09:03.268 --> 09:10.084
Because all over the world we realize
that Sahaja Yoga

09:10.109 --> 09:16.779
is the only way for human emancipation;
is the only way

09:16.804 --> 09:23.691
we are going to transform this world
into a beautiful place.

09:24.770 --> 09:35.814
For that we have to get into a proper
understanding geared up;

09:35.839 --> 09:40.165
absolutely like soldiers into a disciplined
life,

09:40.190 --> 09:51.871
so that whatever we want to do, we can do
in our optimum capacities.

09:51.896 --> 09:58.621
So to allow your full capacities
to manifest, try to negate,

09:58.646 --> 10:05.002
to overlook your gross sensitivities,
whichever come in-between.

10:05.027 --> 10:09.445
You have to cut it short sometimes.
You’ll have to get up early in the morning;

10:09.470 --> 10:15.050
you’ll have to bathe in a funny way,
and it will be a difficult thing.

10:15.075 --> 10:23.492
But if you try to adjust with this
noble idea

10:23.517 --> 10:33.765
that you are a part and parcel
of the great Virat.

10:33.790 --> 10:39.035
And that you all have to join together
in such a way

10:39.060 --> 10:44.293
that in your sensitivity you become
equally the same;

10:44.318 --> 10:47.707
that you understand each other
very well.

10:47.732 --> 10:56.789
I’m sure you will enjoy the love and
hospitality of your hosts here.

10:56.814 --> 11:02.315
This revolution starts on such a day
today I’m very happy.

11:02.340 --> 11:06.550
So we have to have the revolution
acceptable to us.

11:06.575 --> 11:10.672
You know, when French revolution took place,
how people lived;

11:10.697 --> 11:14.738
when in this country people fought
for their freedom, how they lived.

11:14.763 --> 11:21.410
I know, My father sacrificed every single
farthing he had;

11:21.435 --> 11:26.960
he, we had to live in huts while we lived
in very great comforts ourselves.

11:26.985 --> 11:31.767
He sacrificed everything. My mother
went to jail five times.

11:31.799 --> 11:36.326
My father went to jail three times, and
every time he was in the jail

11:36.351 --> 11:41.554
for not less than two to three years. So
you can imagine, with so many children,

11:41.579 --> 11:47.146
how they sacrificed everything that
they had to achieve this freedom.

11:47.171 --> 11:50.953
Now if you have to achieve the freedom
of the spirit

11:50.978 --> 11:57.114
we must have the sense of sacrifice. But
it doesn’t mean sacrifice with complaint;

11:57.139 --> 12:03.997
but sacrifice that can be enjoyed,
sacrifice of which you have to be proud,

12:04.022 --> 12:13.689
sacrifice that you don’t feel, sacrifice
that ennobles you.

12:13.714 --> 12:18.431
That is the spirit with which this
revolution has to take place.

12:18.456 --> 12:22.371
So far, if you know, we have not sacrificed
anything.

12:22.396 --> 12:27.625
Of course, ego and all these nonsensical
things you have sacrificed, no doubt,

12:27.650 --> 12:34.401
but that you never wanted in any way;
none of you liked that ego.

12:34.426 --> 12:41.579
Even Indians had to sacrifice a lot,
they have given up many habits

12:41.604 --> 12:50.174
which are very deterrent or injurious
to healthy growth of this nation.

12:50.199 --> 12:56.027
As sahaja yogis they have also come up
so high,

12:56.052 --> 13:05.299
they have become very honest, extremely
sweet and hospitable people.

13:05.324 --> 13:11.155
In the same way, I would say that
My children abroad

13:11.180 --> 13:17.751
have really done marvelous feats
to give up some things,

13:17.776 --> 13:22.409
which I thought will be difficult for them
to give up.

13:22.434 --> 13:28.414
They have changed their moral values, they
have accepted a very strict moral code.

13:28.439 --> 13:31.686
And they enjoy that morality and that
virtue.

13:31.711 --> 13:35.140
I don’t know how to congratulate you
for this.

13:35.165 --> 13:41.212
You may say, "Mother, your love has
done it", but I just don’t know.

13:41.237 --> 13:47.067
I think it’s your own capacities,
your purvo janmas sanchitas;

13:47.092 --> 13:52.664
whatever you have earned in your previous
lives has done all this.

13:52.689 --> 13:57.767
Otherwise, it is impossible even to change
one person.

13:57.792 --> 14:02.300
All this change has come for the good,
for the enjoyment and happiness.

14:02.325 --> 14:06.068
You don’t have to change much more;
you don’t have to change,

14:06.093 --> 14:12.369
but now you have to enjoy the change.
And the enjoyment of the change comes

14:12.394 --> 14:18.669
when all the tags that you have from India,
from east or from west,

14:18.694 --> 14:24.058
are pulling you down; just throw them away
and come up.

14:24.083 --> 14:33.135
All of you together should enjoy together
the joy and the bliss of your Father.

14:33.160 --> 14:39.482
So today is a great day. This sankramana
that has started

14:39.507 --> 14:44.751
requires serious effort.

14:44.776 --> 14:50.480
We cannot play about with that.
It's very great emergency.

14:50.505 --> 14:54.838
I can feel in the atmosphere
the emergency:

14:54.863 --> 15:01.782
all the Gods and Goddesses are there
to help you to work it out.

15:01.807 --> 15:07.134
You are on the stage and you have
to create

15:07.159 --> 15:12.067
that great drama of revolution.

15:12.092 --> 15:18.402
We have to show to this world that
it’s only the spirit

15:18.427 --> 15:22.961
that can save the world, nothing else.

15:22.986 --> 15:28.394
And so, from today we start our journey

15:28.419 --> 15:34.848
towards that subtlety and that sensitivity,
which you can feel;

15:34.873 --> 15:40.188
which you can feel Nirananda. Nirananda,
your Mothers name is Nira,

15:40.213 --> 15:45.900
and at Sahasrara, you feel the ananda,
the joy of Nira.

15:45.925 --> 15:48.667
May God bless you all.
