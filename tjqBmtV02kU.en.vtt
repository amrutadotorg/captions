00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:07.080
YOGI: … become a tremendous family and spread Sahaja Yoga

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:14.000
in such a way that the Kingdom of God truly comes on this earth.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.880
You graciously declared Yourself,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.880
here in Australia at the Mooladhara Chakra,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.560
declared that You are the one Who is Adi Shakti,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.200
Who is the incarnation of the Holy Spirit.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.640
And [UNCLEAR] [HAVE BEEN SO] [UNCLEAR]

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.080
that mankind has been able to face this stage of his evolution.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.400
By Your declaration we truly thank You, Mother.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.040
We trust that as Your children we’ll be able to

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.720
live up to the tremendous challenge

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.920
and the tremendous work that lies ahead.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.520
But no way here do I speak on behalf of the Australian Sahaja Yogis

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.640
because there is no such thing as Australian Sahaja Yogis.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.720
We are, in fact, all one.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.000
So from all our brothers and sisters, Mother, all over the world,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.840
in all the continents, in all the countries within those continents,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.160
we thank You, Mother, we wish You

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.720
such a joyous birthday on this most auspicious day

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.720
and we all say: “Jay Mataji!”

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.840
SHRI MATAJI: [INAUDIBLE]. Very nice.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.200
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.000
[UNCLEAR] [AND THEN ALL THESE VIRUSES, THIS, THAT] [UNCLEAR]

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.640
It is vibrating now.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.560
You are supposed to [UNCLEAR] to have the [BATH?], you see.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.440
All right.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.160
YOGI: Can we sing the…

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.040
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR],

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.280
because [UNCLEAR] the vibrations start [UNCLEAR].

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.960
[HAVE TO TALK] [UNCLEAR]

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.320
[UNCLEAR] vibrations start flowing.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.680
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.720
“Awaken… awaken them in me.”

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.040
“Awaken them in me.”

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.920
[UNCLEAR]. Just [UNCLEAR]. “Awaken…

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.360
them in me.” “Awaken them in me.”

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.640
YOGI: “And You have… You have awakened them in me.”

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.960
SHRI MATAJI: “Awaken them in me.”

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:58.560
YOGI: This is from all Your Sydney children, Mother.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.840
Happy birthday, Mother!

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.040
SHRI MATAJI: Thank you. Beautiful!

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.080
[UNCLEAR]

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.240
YOGI: [UNCLEAR]

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.360
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR]

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.760
YOGI: Let me read the telegrams to You, Mother.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.800
“This is to Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.”

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.840
“Shri Mataji, on the most auspicious occasion

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.640
of Your sixtieth birthday we respectfully bow at Your Lotus Feet

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.520
and wishing You a very long life,

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.240
full of excellent health, happiness and prosperity!

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.440
We Sahaja Yogis of Bombay pledge on this momentous occasion

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.160
to rededicate ourself to Your most holy cause.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.240
With love from the Bombay Sahaja Yogis.”

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.640
“Mataji Nirmala Devi.”

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.880
“Dear Mother, we all wish You a very very happy and joyful birthday!

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.840
All the Belgian Sahaja Yogis.”

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.520
“Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, most glorious One,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.240
we now have an ashram in Vienna.”

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.960
SHRI MATAJI: That’s the [UNCLEAR]

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.280
“May the Sahaja Yoga Centre, this Sahaja Yoga Centre

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.440
in the world light up this auspicious year.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.360
Happy birthdays and pranams! Sahaja Yogis of Austria.”

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.560
SHRI MATAJI: It was beautiful.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.760
YOGI: And there was a telephone call this morning, Mother,

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.200
from Mary Laura. They now have an ashram in Geneva.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.400
SHRI MATAJI: Great!

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.160
YOGI: She’ll be ringing.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.160
SHRI MATAJI: And Rustem rang Me up this morning too.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.480
YOGI: Rustem from Saudi Arabia telephoned to Mother also.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.680
SHRI MATAJI: And also David rang Me up yesterday before the puja.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.880
[UNCLEAR], yes.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.240
YOGI: “Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.”

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.320
Happy birthday to the Eternal and Divine Mother!

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.080
May we wish You many more

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.760
with an ever growing family love and devotion from France.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.640
At Your Lotus Feet, the French Sahaja Yogis.”

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.160
“Mrs Nirmala Shrivastava.”

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.840
SHRI MATAJI: [HE BROUGHT IT?] [UNCLEAR].

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.800
“Did You find telegram?” I said, “No, [UNCLEAR]”

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.960
YOGI: “My thoughts are continuously with You

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.160
on Your sixtieth birthday anniversary.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.360
Wish we would together on this most important day of our lives.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:56.880
May Your Love for ever lighten the path of true spiritual life!

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:00.080
Fondest love, C.P.”

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:13.280
And from Your daughter and son-in-law Romal and Sadhana:

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:18.000
“Many happy returns with much love! Paper’s complete.”

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.520
“Paper’s complete.” We know what that means.

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.720
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR] I find another [BOX?] [UNCLEAR] and [UNCLEAR].

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.400
And My grandchildren.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.840
YOGI: There are many many cards here, Mother,

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.440
which I’ll let You read at Your leisure.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.920
SHRI MATAJI: Anupama was sick.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.120
So Anupama said, “Let’s have a puja.”

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.000
Rustem told Me on the phone

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.160
that Anupama, My youngest granddaughter, was sick,

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.920
so she said, “Let’s have some puja.”

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.880
So they did some puja in the house of My daughter.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.600
And next day it rained, and rained for eight days,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.520
and flooded all the horrible places there.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.600
And there’s one place known for smuggling, this, that,

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.000
and all that was flooded.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.440
That’s a good thing, something good is going to happen with this.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.640
They are all trying to cleanse.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.800
Wonderful! It should be [UNCLEAR] by [UNCLEAR].

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:25.480
Like in according to Sanskrit…

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.680
Sanskrit…

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:38.080
Sanskrit… I would say, the literary point of view, or…

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:43.280
They have got a big science about what song should be…

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:46.920
what words, what types of words should be used

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.080
for the, say, a song of war now.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.640
So you have to use word t’a, t’ha, d’a, d’ha, n’a out of this.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.200
These [UNCLEAR] “Thaa, thaa, thaa”, like that.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:58.760
T’a, t’ha, d’a, d’ha, n’a.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.760
These are the things used for singing a song —

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.800
when you are singing the song of war, you must use all these words.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.640
So “dis” is the way, it’s a good idea.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.840
But it’s still D, D is… Da, ta, tha, dha is little milder.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.600
Then the t’a.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.320
T’a, d’a, t’ha, d’a, d’ha, n’a.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.840
“T’is the way.”

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.040
If you say “T’is the way…”

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.920
YOGI: D’at’s, d’at’s the way.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.200
SHRI MATAJI: D’aat’s the way. D’aat’s the way.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.480
Let’s… better song let’s sing.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.200
[IT GIVES YOU THAT?] [UNCLEAR].

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.920
They are… they are very scientific in all this.

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.640
What words to use,

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.400
in what kind of a rasa, what mood you are singing.

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.920
There are nine rasas. You know, you have seen that.

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.000
Nine rasas, the dancing you had the…

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:25.080
Please study the dancing, [WHAT KIND] rasas was there.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.000
It’s done by this… Pavan fellow?

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.880
YOGI: Oh yes. Yes, yes.

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.760
SHRI MATAJI: What is dancing on the… the tape?

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.800
YOGI: Yes, we’ve got it somewhere. We have.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.480
SHRI MATAJI: You must seen that. All the nine rasas are there.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.560
You didn’t see the film? How is that?

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.800
YOGI: Ah yes, they’ve seen it, Mother.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.360
We showed it to them when we came back.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.160
SHRI MATAJI: Again tomorrow, today, tonight you see,

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:47.880
so it will be good. There are nine rasas, so… how they act…

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.840
Even in acting, you see, what should,

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.720
what muscles should you put down to express that.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.240
Everything is for…

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.520
Karuna — means compassion —

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.360
or for… what you call this…

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:03.720
Raudra — means anger.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.480
Or for the showing this…

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.920
what you call the Veera Rasa. This is Veera Rasa.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.160
This… what you call in English language…

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.400
What is the mood of war?

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:20.240
War?

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.480
YOGI: Warlike? Martial?

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.800
SHRI MATAJI: Martial.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.960
Martial mood, for the martial mood.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.920
See, so there are different different moods, and he has shown that.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:31.240
Even romans, and everything he has shown.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:36.120
How the muscles going to different styles…

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.160
[I’VE?] finished to [UNCLEAR]?

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.960
Good. Thank you very much.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.720
YOGI: Thank You, Mother.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.960
SHRI MATAJI: So, can you give Me My…

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.840
[UNCLEAR] something for Me to eat.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.880
YOGI: Oh yes. [WE FORGOT IT?] all this celebration.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.960
Should the ladies [COME AND HELP?], Mother?

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:05.840
SHRI MATAJI: No-no-no. Boys can do it.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.800
[UNCLEAR].

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.720
[UNCLEAR] from Spain.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:51.320
YOGI: From [DON?].

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.520
SHRI MATAJI: [DON, OUR DON?].

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.440
YOGI: With all the signatures of the Sahaja Yogis.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.360
SHRI MATAJI: [UNCLEAR].

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.000
“May all Your dreams get true.”

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.360
Very [UNCLEAR].

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.800
[UNCLEAR].

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.880
[THIS IS WHY?], [THIS?] they’ve got lots of people there now.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.080
Just count them.

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.920
YOGI: One, two,

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.120
three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.040
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:50.920
SHRI MATAJI: Oh great!

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:56.840
YOGI: Fourteen people. This is at the centre in Madrid.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.600
“Like something new and wonderful one day you came into my life,

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.760
which vibrated with its first love.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.600
Since then the tender awe of this most innocent joy

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.680
returns every year, hidden in the first buds of your red roses

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:15.800
that say in their silence everything I can’t express.”

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.280
It’s a quotation from Tagor.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.120
Tagor.

00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.840
SHRI MATAJI: From whom is it?

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.400
YOGI: From Wood Green. It’s from London, Mother.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.600
SHRI MATAJI: Wood Green?

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:45.480
YOGI: Sally.
