00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:03,959
Shivaratri Puja, Pune,
17 March 2002.

2
00:00:04,792 --> 00:00:13,959
Tonight we have gathered here to do Shri Shiva Puja.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,041
Those people who have a clean heart can only do Shiva Puja.

4
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:42,208
Those whose heart is not clean cannot do Shiva Puja.

5
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,166
It's a simple principle of Shri Shivaratri.

6
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:06,166
As you have seen yesterday, we have snakes,

7
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:11,792
or, these are horrible snakes

8
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,291
guiding behind the Shiva Linga.

9
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:30,625
The significance is this - those who are clean in heart,

10
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:38,291
who are full of love for others,

11
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:51,125
are always guarded by the power of Shiva,

12
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,041
which are the snakes.

13
00:01:55,291 --> 00:02:02,041
It's a symbolic thing, to say, very symbolic.

14
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:07,375
But I must say that animals understand

15
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:14,208
Divine force much better than human beings, much better.

16
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:18,625
Because they have a clean heart.

17
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:28,875
Whatever is their lifestyle built by nature,

18
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:30,875
they carry on with it.

19
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:37,166
But there's no malice, there's no jealousy,

20
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:42,208
there's not all these mean things in their heart.

21
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:45,667
They do it because it is supposed to be.

22
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:53,291
But the quality of human beings is only one

23
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:59,667
- and that is how much they love and forgive.

24
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:07,500
Loving capacity of human beings are such by

25
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:12,041
which they conquer all their negative forces -

26
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:16,500
they can, easily, see that it's not good

27
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,667
to have all these qualities,

28
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:24,291
or maybe that they understand it's not noble

29
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:30,041
to indulge into all these inhuman behaviour.

30
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:39,667
They are not bound to indulge into all these things.

31
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:49,041
Neither they are asked to be,

32
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:59,959
but suddenly they get lured by such things which has got hatred,

33
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:08,291
jealously and greed.

34
00:04:11,667 --> 00:04:14,125
You see how Shiva lives.

35
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:17,375
He lives in the Himalayas.

36
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:23,792
See what clothes He wears, what He eats.

37
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:30,375
He has no demand for anything because He's complete, He's perfect.

38
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:38,000
Such a personality is Shiva's.

39
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:42,208
And if you are worshipping Him,

40
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:46,000
you should find out within your heart

41
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:56,041
what sort of feelings you have, what sort of malice you nurture.

42
00:04:56,125 --> 00:05:02,542
These days in India, greed has become the main point.

43
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,834
They are so mean and so low.

44
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:18,166
Which impossible to understand that they think money is everything,

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,041
which is not in the culture of Indians, no, no.

46
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,041
In no way.

47
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,959
But somehow they have picked it up,

48
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,542
in the foreign countries perhaps,

49
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,375
and it is spreading very much now,

50
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:38,542
that money is the most important thing.

51
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,959
Think of Shiva.

52
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,208
He never thought of money.

53
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:51,208
He never wanted any money.

54
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,291
He never wanted to show off himself.

55
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:03,834
There is such a difference between Shiva and Shakti.

56
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,208
In their whole attitude.

57
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:12,625
Because Shiva is absolutely a liberated personality,

58
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:14,625
he's not bothered.

59
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,667
If the people

60
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:21,166
are indulging into wrong things, he'll destroy - finished!

61
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:24,959
He doesn't want to cure,

62
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:27,542
He doesn't want to improve, nothing of the kind.

63
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,959
But for the Shakti it is important,

64
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:35,959
because this is Her child, this universe is Her child.

65
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:39,125
All this is created by Her,

66
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,792
so naturally She is worried

67
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,333
and She doesn't like people

68
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:48,834
who try to take to mean things and nonsense.

69
00:06:52,208 --> 00:06:58,959
First of all it was human beings started indulging in power.

70
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:05,125
They moved from countries to country to empower themselves.

71
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,291
Where is that power gone? Finished.

72
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:14,417
Then, after that, what happened with them

73
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:19,709
is that they left their style with others.

74
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,125
And now it seems

75
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:28,834
it is very common to see people shamelessly being greedy.

76
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,542
For them, is the solution, is Shiva.

77
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,333
All such people will be destroyed. First of all

78
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:47,709
they will be exposed and then they will be destroyed,

79
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,542
to the last bit of it.

80
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,333
Another thing is that

81
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:02,458
Shiva respects a person who has a good character;

82
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:05,834
a person with a good character.

83
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:11,333
And if anyone is bad charactered

84
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:20,458
or indulges into bad things, Shiva won't spare them.

85
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:29,041
So the Shakti creates, protects, looks after them, brings them up.

86
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:33,709
But Shiva is sitting there, just to destroy!

87
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:40,709
Very important, this destruction is very important.

88
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:44,125
The Shakti doesn't show those qualities.

89
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,333
She may destroy some rakshasas,

90
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:50,166
but He can destroy nations after nations.

91
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:59,125
First of all the ego you have - who will destroy that?

92
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:05,458
, Shiva. Shiva is in your Sahasrara.

93
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:08,125
He is sitting in the Sahasrara;

94
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:11,709
now remember, on top of everything.

95
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:25,291
The other day I saw one gentleman from the Broadcasting, a newsman,

96
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:32,291
who was very, very stupid and was talking, very harshly.

97
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:39,625
And I saw his Ekadesha Rudra "My God" I said,

98
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:44,458
"This one is now going to be in trouble. "

99
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:50,125
What is Ekadesha is nothing but the eleven powers of Shiva.

100
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:53,500
They build up here

101
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,667
and give you all kinds of diseases;

102
00:09:56,834 --> 00:10:00,000
the worst of all is cancer.

103
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:04,875
And I knew that this fellow is going to have a very bad time.

104
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:09,166
He is not a Sahaja Yogi, how am I to tell him?

105
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,208
How anybody has to tell him?

106
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:16,041
But it comes from this Ekadesha Rudra.

107
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,625
Now these are eleven powers of Shiva, very well described.

108
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,166
Now these powers start working on people,

109
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,208
even on Sahaja Yogis,

110
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,875
if they do not follow the principle of Sahaja Yoga.

111
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:39,166
He is, I should say, watching everything.

112
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,291
Every part of your life He watches.

113
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:50,333
How you behave, what you do, what is your dharma

114
00:10:50,792 --> 00:10:52,625
- He watches all that.

115
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And so many saints have warned you,

116
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,333
so many incarnations have warned you;

117
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:04,458
but I tell you if don't listen to them,

118
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:08,208
then Shiva is not going to listen.

119
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,875
He doesn't listen to anyone.

120
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,875
If he's angry, he's angry.

121
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:19,375
Whatever it is, very difficult to convince Him

122
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:24,917
that 'Please spare this person, it's alright. Forgive.

123
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,125
' But his basic quality is forgiveness,

124
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,500
can you imagine? His basic quality is forgiveness.

125
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:38,875
But if He doesn't forgive, then you are finished.

126
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:45,375
Up to a point maybe He might forgive, but after that..

127
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:50,166
It's a very, very difficult situation.

128
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:55,166
And I find that people don't realise

129
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,792
what Shiva is.

130
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,709
In the south we have two types of people worshipers.

131
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,500
One are shaivaites, another vaishnavaites.

132
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,208
They are having a big fight between them.

133
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:11,375
Now it is less, much less.

134
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:17,667
What is the work of Vishnu is to give you realisation,

135
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:21,792
emancipation of human beings, evolution of human beings.

136
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:31,291
But if you fail in your goodness, in your dharma,

137
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:36,959
then Shiva comes in your life.

138
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,667
We have to understand

139
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:44,667
that we are all surrounded by their powers,

140
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:47,792
we are all made by their powers,

141
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:53,166
is the Shakti who is protecting you.

142
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:59,792
But to an extent. She cannot go above Shiva,

143
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,375
She cannot cross Him.

144
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,792
These days you find so many people indulging into politics

145
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,375
- it's all money-making propositions.

146
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:21,291
They all try to make money, it's not politics!

147
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:26,375
They don't do any good to the whole communities, nowhere

148
00:13:26,792 --> 00:13:31,041
- either under fear or under abandonment.

149
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:38,375
They behave in such a manner that they are not afraid of God,

150
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:45,375
they are not afraid of His own attention on them.

151
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:51,291
Perhaps they don't know that they are under the attention of Shiva.

152
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,166
He's watching each and every person,

153
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:01,834
whether you are Australian, English or Indian.

154
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:09,291
Whatever religion you may follow, He's watching them.

155
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,166
This is a thing one has to understand.

156
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:16,542
And once you understand this,

157
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:23,208
you will accept that you have to be good and dharmic people.

158
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:26,166
You have to be good character people.

159
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:30,834
Why people talk of good character?

160
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,166
Try to understand!

161
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:37,542
It's stupidity these days when people don't believe in it.

162
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,959
People are doing all kinds of things,

163
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:52,125
they are drinking, they are playing this...money business.

164
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:54,667
All kinds of things they are doing

165
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:03,959
without having any fear of the wrath of God.

166
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,166
And that wrath comes from Shiva.

167
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,166
I would like to warn you all,

168
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,458
though you are all my children - be careful!

169
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:17,291
Try to weigh every step that you take.

170
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:22,041
Of course I am there to support you, to help you,

171
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,166
to protect you.

172
00:15:23,542 --> 00:15:26,709
But, not beyond Shiva,

173
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:29,709
I can't go beyond Him.

174
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:39,959
It's such a power of Shiva, it's such an authority of Shiva.

175
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:45,458
And to worship Him means to worship goodness in Him.

176
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:53,125
The goodness could be compassion, could be love,

177
00:15:53,166 --> 00:15:55,959
could be forgiveness, anything.

178
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,166
He likes only good people,

179
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,166
and He will protect only good people.

180
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:06,333
For example, some people are very power oriented,

181
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:11,208
some are money oriented and some are power oriented.

182
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:15,542
And the power oriented also do it for money sometimes,

183
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,542
that's the aim.

184
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,834
They'll not stay in Sahaj.

185
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,834
They will be displaced.

186
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:26,041
They do it, and then come and ask for forgiveness,

187
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:29,333
"Oh Mother forgive us, we have done it".

188
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:33,166
But try not to do anything of that kind.

189
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:39,166
I, of course, forgive you, but Shiva, He won't, He won't.

190
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,125
He will take you to task

191
00:16:43,166 --> 00:16:44,375
and then you will come to Me "Mother,

192
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:47,041
You must save us!" It's very difficult.

193
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:51,125
From His clutches it is very difficult.

194
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:54,458
Also He's a very forgiving person.

195
00:16:54,834 --> 00:16:58,125
He forgives you, many things.

196
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:01,333
Because of Me also He forgives.

197
00:17:01,709 --> 00:17:04,834
But, after some time when He takes over,

198
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,458
there's no appeal, there's no safety.

199
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:12,458
I do not want to frighten you,

200
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:16,208
but I want to tell you the truth, it is the truth.

201
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,875
You have to try to be good people.

202
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:27,041
You have to try to be really good character people.

203
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:31,333
I am told some people who are in Sahaja Yoga

204
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:37,333
indulge in money laundering and all that.

205
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:41,041
Also some of them have very bad characters,

206
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,458
they run after girls

207
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:48,291
and they try to look at the girls and all sorts of things.

208
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:53,208
Now this has ruined the west especially.

209
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:57,000
Also our Indians are learning from it.

210
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:03,000
As it is, we have to respect ourselves.

211
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:09,333
If we don't respect ourselves, and we try to misbehave,

212
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:17,709
I can only help you with your Kundalini.

213
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,000
But if you go too much beyond it,

214
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:27,500
Ekadesha Rudra will catch, no doubt.

215
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,166
It's a very big barrier on your forehead.

216
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:45,125
Eka-desha Rudra, and it is so effective nowadays, so much active.

217
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,917
All kinds of diseases which are coming out, is all incurable,

218
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,333
are because of Ekadesha.

219
00:18:54,792 --> 00:19:02,000
And also those who are suffering from possessions.

220
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,625
The other day I met somebody who was very much caught-up.

221
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,208
And the Ekadesha was working.

222
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:19,083
I found out that he is very fanatically

223
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:24,000
influenced by something.

224
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,291
I don't want to name it,

225
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:34,625
but these, we have found out, are not correct things.

226
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,083
In every religion we have

227
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:42,375
people who are spreading nonsensical ideas.

228
00:19:42,792 --> 00:19:46,291
Now if you don't have discretion about it,

229
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,208
nobody can help you.

230
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,208
You should have a full discretion

231
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:57,291
as to what is right and what is wrong.

232
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:03,792
Then Shiva is with you.

233
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:06,583
But if you indulge

234
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:14,166
into all such nonsensical things, it is self-destructive, I must say

235
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:19,500
But to the Self which is destructive is the power of Shiva.

236
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:25,500
What we call the Self here, is the power of Shiva.

237
00:20:27,875 --> 00:20:31,500
He destroys by many ways, by many ways.

238
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,375
You can lose your reputation,

239
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:39,375
you can lose your health,

240
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:43,792
you can lose your wealth,

241
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,166
everything can happen to you

242
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:51,291
till you are completely finished and that

243
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:58,875
I have known people on the death-bed also,

244
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,166
start talking about money,

245
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:05,250
'What should she get, money, how will he get money,

246
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:06,667
and this and that'.

247
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:10,083
Instead of talking about God

248
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:13,875
or Self Realisation, they are talking like this.

249
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:18,125
It's such a noble thing.

250
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:24,500
But if you see Shiva, He doesn't possess anything,

251
00:21:24,959 --> 00:21:26,792
He doesn't want anything.

252
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,041
Whatever you give to him,

253
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,792
as a samarpana or anything,

254
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:41,667
that He doesn't accept, and He passes on to the Shakti,

255
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:44,041
"You do whatever you want to do. "

256
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:48,959
She's the one who is working out everything

257
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:55,375
to benefit you to make you happy. He's not bothered.

258
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:59,792
In this case, you have to please Shiva!

259
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,667
He will not try to please you,

260
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:06,041
you have to go all the way to please Him.

261
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:10,792
It is a very difficult personality of Shiva.

262
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:18,375
In the Koran, it is not written separately

263
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:25,291
for Allah or for Shiva, it is not differentiated.

264
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,208
Because the people with whom He had to deal

265
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:32,208
were all uneducated, stupid people.

266
00:22:32,291 --> 00:22:34,959
So He didn't give all the details that

267
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,166
God is in different forms.

268
00:22:38,542 --> 00:22:41,166
So there is only one Allah they know.

269
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:45,208
But they don't do anything that

270
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:49,959
shows the differentiations of their jobs and work.

271
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,959
It is the Shakti who loves, I agree.

272
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,834
But She too, can get angry very much.

273
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:06,166
And once She gets angry, there is no end to it!

274
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:12,375
Now I have to tell you, as Sahaja Yogis,

275
00:23:12,834 --> 00:23:17,291
that you develop your qualities to please the Shiva.

276
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:27,959
It's too much of hankering, too much of 'wants'.

277
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:34,166
All this is not necessary.

278
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:38,834
Of course I want you to live well, and beautifully,

279
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,458
not stupidly - to go into jungles

280
00:23:42,834 --> 00:23:45,959
or to behave like hippies - that's not the point.

281
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,834
The point is,

282
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:56,834
from your heart, the attachment to things must go away.

283
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:01,667
A person who is a Shiva Bhakti

284
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,834
- he doesn't care for money, he doesn't know about money.

285
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:14,125
He is a very generous person, extremely. He's just generous.

286
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:19,208
People may say, "Stupid"- the way he goes on, the way he works it.

287
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,458
But I don't think so.

288
00:24:22,834 --> 00:24:31,166
That's not at all the description.

289
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:37,959
The description of a man

290
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:45,291
who is a bhakta of Shiva has no interest in money,

291
00:24:45,709 --> 00:24:47,709
is very generous.

292
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:52,166
Anything you ask from that, he'll give.

293
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:55,000
Mahavira's was like that.

294
00:24:55,041 --> 00:25:01,208
Mahavira had gone for his meditation in his own garden

295
00:25:02,458 --> 00:25:09,709
and Vishnu as Shri Krishna

296
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,542
came and told him that,

297
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,834
"See, I have no clothes.

298
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:18,834
You have got this cloth, why don't you give me half of it?"

299
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:26,125
He said, "All right, you can have it. You can have the whole. "

300
00:25:27,208 --> 00:25:33,333
Because he said this, "My house is here, I'll just wear my clothes"

301
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:35,834
What he did was not

302
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:41,125
to show that nudity is a very great thing.

303
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,625
But if you see the Jains, what to do,

304
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:52,125
they make big, big statues of Mahavira

305
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:55,125
showing Him completely nude.

306
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:58,291
I mean, this is the perversion of human mind.

307
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,291
Why He did it, we should know.

308
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:04,458
He was so detached, so detached, to

309
00:26:04,834 --> 00:26:08,208
give away the clothes, what is the harm?

310
00:26:08,625 --> 00:26:11,125
It was not to show-off or anything.

311
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:16,875
But the generosity, people don't understand.

312
00:26:17,291 --> 00:26:20,625
And the Jainies are the least generous!

313
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:30,041
So the quality of all these great incarnations is also not understood.

314
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:38,625
Because a kind of an illusion is there.

315
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,041
For example, Shiva is always with very few clothes, very few.

316
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:52,625
And what does he eat? No-one knows.

317
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,875
What is his desires and what does he want? No-one knows.

318
00:27:00,291 --> 00:27:05,125
A person with a great knowledge of music will sing before him,

319
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,291
He's alright.

320
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,041
Or even any madcap comes and sings, He's alright.

321
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,041
For Him it doesn't matter,

322
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:21,041
He's not meticulous about how the music is and what the notes are,

323
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,625
whether it is alright or not, no.

324
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,291
He is beyond all these things.

325
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:31,875
He is beyond all these formalities that we have about everything,

326
00:27:32,291 --> 00:27:35,125
he is beyond.

327
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:40,792
He is spirituality itself, he is beyond all these things.

328
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:46,458
Whether you are a musician or you are an artist,

329
00:27:46,792 --> 00:27:51,792
whatever it is you are, He'll enjoy.

330
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:56,208
He's the enjoyer, and He'll enjoy -

331
00:27:56,625 --> 00:28:02,625
whatever is simple, whatever is given with the heart, He'll enjoy.

332
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Whatever is expressed with the heart, He'll enjoy.

333
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:10,333
He is not a conditioned person,

334
00:28:10,792 --> 00:28:15,208
that it should be modern, it should be such and such.

335
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,166
He is not conditioned.

336
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:22,166
He doesn't think that way like human beings who will sit down

337
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:27,375
and make a meticulous everything, does it fit into it or not.

338
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:31,291
Even, even for art,

339
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:37,166
even for anything that is created out of somebody's heart,

340
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:40,625
they will try to discourage that person.

341
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:46,375
I have seen people, they have such conditioning.

342
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:50,166
And one thing about Shiva, he has no

343
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:53,792
conditioning of anything, nothing.

344
00:28:54,375 --> 00:28:57,291
That's why they call him a mast-maulaa

345
00:28:57,375 --> 00:29:00,208
- He is not at all conditioned.

346
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:03,208
If you have any conditioning in your mind,

347
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:05,208
then you are not a Shivabhakta.

348
00:29:05,667 --> 00:29:08,792
It's all right, you should dress up well, you should do this …

349
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:12,792
but you should not have conditioning that 'If you don't do that

350
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:21,208
you are being out of cast, out of fashion, out of this …'.

351
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:27,667
It is very difficult for people not to accept.

352
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:32,375
All kinds of fashions are coming nowadays, all kinds.

353
00:29:32,792 --> 00:29:36,291
I tell them, "What is this?" "Oh this is the fashion. "

354
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:39,500
Is it some God behind this fashion,

355
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:43,125
or is there some deity who is telling you these fashions?

356
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,959
Today it comes, tomorrow it will disappear.

357
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,041
So, what I am saying,

358
00:29:49,125 --> 00:29:53,291
that if you have to worship Shiva,

359
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:56,291
you should de-condition yourself.

360
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:00,125
You are living in the world of Sahasrara.

361
00:30:00,959 --> 00:30:05,291
Now, somebody is not properly dressed - finished!

362
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:08,959
Somebody is over-popularly dressed - finished!

363
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:13,959
Human beings have a capacity to criticise everyone.

364
00:30:15,291 --> 00:30:19,542
And to criticise everyone, this is nothing fundamental

365
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:23,375
because if you do it on vibrations, one can understand.

366
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:25,959
But not on vibrations, just

367
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,375
because 'this is not the fashion, that is not the fashion'.

368
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:36,291
What is the fashion of Shiva, tell me.

369
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,792
Has He any fashions?

370
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:42,542
Anything you give Him, He's happy.

371
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:45,542
Whatever you give Him, He eats that.

372
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:54,542
He is full of such appreciation because He is personified as Joy.

373
00:30:55,208 --> 00:30:58,000
He is peace and He is joy.

374
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:02,041
If you are worshippers of Shiva,

375
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:08,542
then you should not have any conditioning of any kind.

376
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:15,542
I mean, normally I also wear simple saris, very simple.

377
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:20,667
And it happens that people think I am a very poor woman.

378
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:22,667
I am poor

379
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:29,166
because I don't care for money, I don't bother.

380
00:31:29,542 --> 00:31:39,166
So, we should know that Shiva is the poorest man, purest God.

381
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:45,125
He doesn't wear any alankaras, he doesn't wear anything, just

382
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:49,166
he lives with his own body.

383
00:31:49,542 --> 00:31:56,000
Because he is nothing but embodiment of enjoyment,

384
00:31:56,458 --> 00:32:04,834
nothing but complete form of enjoyment and joy.

385
00:32:06,208 --> 00:32:10,834
So another quality of Shivabhakta* should be joy.

386
00:32:12,166 --> 00:32:15,834
You should be joyous about everything

387
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:20,959
- whatever you see, whatever type of person you see.

388
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:23,291
So the only way you can do, is

389
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:27,542
give up human quality of criticism

390
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:32,709
- to criticise others.

391
00:32:33,125 --> 00:32:36,291
Like if the English go into the Indian house,

392
00:32:36,709 --> 00:32:37,959
they say "We don't like it. "

393
00:32:38,041 --> 00:32:39,291
"Yes, what, what you don't like?"

394
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:42,291
"We didn't like the carpet. "

395
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:48,542
'I don't like it' itself is against your Shakti.

396
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Then, if supposing an American goes to an English home,

397
00:32:53,041 --> 00:32:56,125
he'll say, "I don't like it. " It's very common.

398
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:59,709
All the people say "I don't like it", "I didn't like that".

399
00:33:00,125 --> 00:33:01,834
Who are you

400
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,458
to say 'I don't like it' or 'I like it'.

401
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:10,208
People don't realise that by saying all these things,

402
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:14,834
you are showing that there is no Shiva principle in you.

403
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:22,041
I can understand somebody who cannot walk, alright,

404
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:28,125
for such a person is allowed to use some sticks or something,

405
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:30,166
allowed.

406
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,125
But if he says "I don't like that person

407
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:34,709
because he doesn't use the stick.",

408
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:39,000
shows that he is such an egoistical fellow;

409
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:43,041
himself is using the stick and

410
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:46,542
he wants to create what, warns or what,

411
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,458
in a democratic country, that people should

412
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:54,458
walk with the sticks in their hands. It is very difficult.

413
00:33:54,834 --> 00:33:57,709
In the west it is very common, you see,

414
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:00,041
to have this kind of a hat,

415
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:03,291
to have this kind of a dress,

416
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,208
to wear this kind of a cheroot.

417
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:09,125
All kinds of things have a conditioning.

418
00:34:10,208 --> 00:34:15,625
Nowadays the hairstyle has become very funny with women.

419
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,291
Because they don't put oil in their hair.

420
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:26,208
They will not have any grease in their hair.

421
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:30,000
If somebody's going to meet them they will wash their hair.

422
00:34:31,041 --> 00:34:33,291
I don't think it looks very nice.

423
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:34,625
Of course I don't say that

424
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,875
you need not have so much of oil on your face and ears.

425
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:43,333
But, what is so important?

426
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:55,208
In life, is also this is another thing that we are very self-centred.

427
00:34:56,709 --> 00:34:59,000
We want to impress people.

428
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:07,291
If I wear a dress or anything, it should impress.

429
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:12,000
I mean, even it impresses - what?

430
00:35:13,041 --> 00:35:17,041
If a snake comes along, he will bit you, whatever dress

431
00:35:17,875 --> 00:35:21,500
you might be wearing, whatever country you might be from.

432
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:29,625
All this kind of identification, it doesn't behove a Shivabhakta.

433
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,625
A Shivabhakta has to be just

434
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,625
absolutely lost in the raptures of joy.

435
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:47,208
Very particular about hairdress, very particular about dresses

436
00:35:47,417 --> 00:35:50,166
- I don't know what they are particular about.

437
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:54,208
With all that, what do they gain? Nothing.

438
00:35:55,625 --> 00:35:57,667
Do they become popular?

439
00:35:58,458 --> 00:36:00,959
And this kind of popularity,

440
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:04,792
which is so skin-deep, what's the use?

441
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:10,792
You must have respect, respect of your being.

442
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:17,041
As not only human beings, but as Sahaja Yogis.

443
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,166
You are Sahaja Yogis.

444
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:25,875
We are Shiva's bhaktas, we don't care.

445
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:28,875
We are not bothered.

446
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:35,125
Whatever it is, Shiva is there within us

447
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:45,208
and we shine with that power within us that is of Kundalini.

448
00:36:47,375 --> 00:36:50,125
You may be very well dressed, you may be anything.

449
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,792
If your vibrations are bad, what's the use?

450
00:36:54,166 --> 00:36:55,959
If you cannot judge people

451
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:58,959
by their vibrations,by nonsensical things

452
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:04,583
like their dress and moustaches, is it of any value?

453
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:10,208
In Sahaja Yoga your value system has to be Sahaj.

454
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:14,875
I have seen many people,

455
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:18,166
"I don't like their house, I didn't like this …"

456
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:23,875
'I don't like' is the sentence, is nishidda,

457
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:27,667
is to be given up by Sahaja Yogis.

458
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:33,375
If you don't like anything, you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

459
00:37:37,291 --> 00:37:43,500
Now, of course, I mean, if there is somebody who is anti-Sahaj and all that,

460
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:48,375
but still by saying 'I don't like', what are you going to gain?

461
00:37:50,291 --> 00:37:52,166
It's a waste of energy.

462
00:37:56,291 --> 00:38:01,291
Because of this, in Sahaja Yoga I have seen,

463
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:05,500
people have created problems for Me, so many problems.

464
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:10,375
Only because they are such much 'self' oriented.

465
00:38:12,792 --> 00:38:16,792
"This man is bad, that woman is bad, he is this, that …"

466
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,500
Sometimes I am surprised.

467
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:21,792
Because when those people come to me,

468
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:25,375
I am amazed that they are very nice people.

469
00:38:26,792 --> 00:38:30,291
But people are very self-centred, also.

470
00:38:30,583 --> 00:38:35,375
Like I have seen people who are not bothered

471
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:42,667
to come to meetings, to pujas.

472
00:38:44,041 --> 00:38:46,208
Because they have got work.

473
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:54,291
Altogether there are eleven pujas, but they don't come.

474
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,291
Because they are very busy.

475
00:39:00,667 --> 00:39:02,959
At least to one puja you should come.

476
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:12,667
But those who are Shivabhaktas only enjoy nothing but pujas.

477
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:15,208
Nothing else

478
00:39:16,291 --> 00:39:22,542
Their whole being is absolutely vibrated by Shiva bhakti.

479
00:39:22,959 --> 00:39:25,667
To them, that's the most important thing to do.

480
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:29,959
Also there are people in Sahaja Yoga

481
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,291
who are trying to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

482
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:37,166
Very wrong, very wrong, very wrong.

483
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,959
Sahaja Yoga is to give you punyas,

484
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,375
to give you blessings,

485
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:49,000
and if that is not in your mind,

486
00:39:49,458 --> 00:39:50,375
better give up Sahaja Yoga.

487
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:53,959
You can join some business or something

488
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,834
of malpractices very easily, very easily.

489
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:59,458
Till you end up in the jail you are there.

490
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:08,291
But to enjoy your spiritual powers

491
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:11,291
you must learn certain things.

492
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:15,166
And one of them is de-condition yourself

493
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:19,166
- 'I don't like it' or 'I like it' -

494
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:23,709
this sentence must go away from your tongue!

495
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,125
Likes and dislikes

496
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:33,125
are only for people who have limited vision.

497
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:39,458
You should learn to appreciate.

498
00:40:39,834 --> 00:40:42,166
Your power of appreciation will show

499
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:45,583
how spiritually you are endowed.

500
00:40:48,959 --> 00:40:54,458
And your power of observation

501
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:56,959
will show what do you observe.

502
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:00,834
For example, some people will come and tell me,

503
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:05,458
"I didn't like that lady, she was wearing a funny sari. "

504
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:08,458
I mean, what is this?

505
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:16,041
"I didn't like her, because she was putting her hand on her head".

506
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,333
So what?

507
00:41:19,709 --> 00:41:22,542
Because you make your own images of people, and you want

508
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,000
everybody to be like that, otherwise you don't like it.

509
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:31,125
Whether you like it or don't like it, nobody's going to change.

510
00:41:32,166 --> 00:41:34,458
Why waste your energy?

511
00:41:36,208 --> 00:41:39,542
Sometimes there are musicians who are not so good.

512
00:41:46,458 --> 00:41:54,625
I remember, once I went home and I asked my father,

513
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,041
"How does this musician sing?"

514
00:41:57,458 --> 00:42:01,291
He says, "He's very courageous, very courageous. "

515
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:03,291
I said, "Why, what happened?"

516
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:08,125
He said, "He sings without bothering about it

517
00:42:08,166 --> 00:42:10,583
and he goes out of tune sometimes,

518
00:42:10,792 --> 00:42:13,000
he goes out of taala, doesn't matter,

519
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:14,333
but he sings.

520
00:42:14,709 --> 00:42:16,458
He's very courageous, himmatwala"

521
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:21,000
So, that's how he used to appreciate, I have seen.

522
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:26,333
When this fellow started singing, I saw he was like that,

523
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:31,709
but my father was saying "Wa-wa, wa-wa" and encouraging him.

524
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:36,041
You see, I have seen in my father these divine qualities,

525
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:39,333
how he used to tolerate,

526
00:42:39,709 --> 00:42:43,875
how he used to - I mean not tolerance also, just appreciation.

527
00:42:44,291 --> 00:42:47,709
Of any kind of thing he used to appreciate.

528
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:50,917
That's what, if the Sahaja Yogis have that

529
00:42:51,208 --> 00:42:56,208
condition of appreciation they will enjoy everything.

530
00:42:56,417 --> 00:42:59,625
Because you kill your enjoyment, do you know that?

531
00:43:02,041 --> 00:43:05,625
You are all variety of people here, all variety of dresses,

532
00:43:05,792 --> 00:43:10,500
all variety of families and so many countries you are here.

533
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:14,291
To Me you are nothing but Sahaja Yogis, my children, that's all.

534
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:19,792
Now I don't go on judging you on your dress, or

535
00:43:19,959 --> 00:43:22,875
on what your hairstyle is, no.

536
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:27,500
All modern things are extremely conditioning.

537
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:35,500
And they condition you so much that you get irresponsible.

538
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,041
As Sahaja Yogis you get irresponsible.

539
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:44,291
Your first and foremost responsibility is Sahaja Yoga.

540
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:47,208
Because you should know what a work it is.

541
00:43:48,625 --> 00:43:55,125
It is such a great work, to transform the whole world - that is My vision.

542
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,792
And this old age I think the same.

543
00:43:59,166 --> 00:44:03,500
Now, if that is My vision, what should be your attitude?

544
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:08,125
That we should go all out to spread Sahaja Yoga.

545
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,208
That's the main thing.

546
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:17,792
I call you for these pujas just to renovate, I should say,

547
00:44:18,166 --> 00:44:21,500
to give you more of energy and all that.

548
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:24,709
But if you are just taking it as a great

549
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,959
blessings and sitting at home it's of no use.

550
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:31,041
You must spread Sahaja Yoga!

551
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:34,291
I was surprised that they said

552
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:40,792
in Lucknow there are only 200 Sahaja Yogis. How can that be?

553
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:43,291
First time I went to Lucknow,

554
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,875
there were at least three thousand Sahaja Yogis

555
00:44:46,291 --> 00:44:49,375
and we had not fixed any hall or anything.

556
00:44:49,792 --> 00:44:53,875
And can you imagine, suddenly I find so many people.

557
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:58,166
How is it there can be two hundred Sahaja Yogis?

558
00:44:58,208 --> 00:45:03,375
Either you are telling lies, or you are good for nothing.

559
00:45:04,792 --> 00:45:07,792
So the responsibility of all the Sahaja Yogis,

560
00:45:08,041 --> 00:45:13,125
of all the Sahaja Yogis, first and foremost,

561
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,291
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

562
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:18,500
How many people have you given realisation?

563
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:22,125
Where have you talked about Sahaja Yoga?

564
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,875
I have seen even in the plane, if you are travelling,

565
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:30,917
anyone who is there will tell Me "My guru is this,

566
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:33,875
you know, such a great guru, this that. "

567
00:45:34,291 --> 00:45:37,667
Openly, shamelessly, about horrible gurus!

568
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:45,166
While you people are very shy to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

569
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:49,375
Never publicly unless and until

570
00:45:49,792 --> 00:45:54,166
you have a programme, and public programme and all that.

571
00:45:56,291 --> 00:46:01,166
You have no time, also, for Sahaja Yoga, very busy people.

572
00:46:05,667 --> 00:46:12,917
So, if you have to follow Shiva and His blessings all the time,

573
00:46:13,125 --> 00:46:14,667
His protection to you...

574
00:46:14,959 --> 00:46:22,375
then you have to be Sahaja Yogis of very high quality.

575
00:46:24,792 --> 00:46:27,792
It shows when you go all out

576
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:30,125
to spread Sahaja Yoga.

577
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:35,375
That is the thing missing.

578
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:38,667
I am very happy that in Australia

579
00:46:39,041 --> 00:46:41,375
Sahaja Yoga has spread so much.

580
00:46:41,792 --> 00:46:45,125
I don't know what has happened.

581
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:49,041
In a far fetched place like Australia.

582
00:46:49,959 --> 00:46:53,208
In the beginning I had some set-backs

583
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:58,083
but now it has spread. Also in Austria it has spread.

584
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,959
And also in Italy.

585
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:08,041
But otherwise, just doesn't spread. What's the matter?

586
00:47:08,166 --> 00:47:12,000
The matter is the leaders are not going all-out.

587
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:16,291
Say, for in England I travelled from north to south,

588
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,208
east to west in all the directions.

589
00:47:21,959 --> 00:47:27,375
We have very poor, very poor Sahaja Yogis there.

590
00:47:27,834 --> 00:47:32,959
You have to go to universities, to younger people.

591
00:47:34,041 --> 00:47:40,000
If hippy-ism can spread, why not Sahaja Yoga?

592
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,542
It spread like wild-fire, why not Sahaja Yoga?

593
00:47:47,959 --> 00:47:54,542
All these things are there, which I have to warn you - be careful!

594
00:47:55,959 --> 00:47:59,667
If you have got Realisation, you have a responsibility

595
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:05,208
- to give realisation to others, and to spread Sahaja Yoga.

596
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:12,166
If you can't do it, then God save you.

597
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:13,959
I have nothing to say.

598
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
You have to introspect,

599
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:20,458
'What have I done for Sahaja Yoga.

600
00:48:21,834 --> 00:48:23,458
What have I got from Sahaja Yoga?'

601
00:48:25,834 --> 00:48:29,667
And I am sure after this Shiva puja,

602
00:48:29,917 --> 00:48:34,542
you will dedicate yourself to Shiva principle within you.

603
00:48:34,834 --> 00:48:38,834
Shiva principle doesn't 'stir out',

604
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:47,959
it's very, very stern, it's very powerful.

605
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:56,458
You have to dedicate, and you have to surrender.

606
00:48:56,834 --> 00:49:03,166
Above every other job, above every other performance,

607
00:49:03,542 --> 00:49:05,458
the highest is this.

608
00:49:05,834 --> 00:49:13,709
So, with this, I ask Shiva to give you blessings,

609
00:49:14,125 --> 00:49:16,041
complete blessings,

610
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:22,333
so that you get transformed into the personality of Shiva.

611
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:23,333
May God bless you all
