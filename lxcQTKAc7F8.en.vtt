Public Program The Nabhi Chakra

00:03.880 --> 00:07.120
New Delhi – India January 31, 1983

00:08.280 --> 00:15.080
The music was very fine and elevating to all of you.

00:17.800 --> 00:21.760
The effect of music in Sahaja Yoga is tremendous,

00:21.920 --> 00:25.680
and if a Sahaja Yogi sings the song

00:25.960 --> 00:32.760
it's so great that it acts like a mantra upon My being.

00:33.520 --> 00:38.000
So I'm very thankful to Mrs. Venogopalan

00:39.160 --> 00:44.280
for singing such a beautiful song today. It stirred Me completely.

00:44.520 --> 00:51.320
Then Gavin Brown was very sweet. He's an Englishman, very gentle

00:51.480 --> 00:54.160
and a very steady Sahaja Yogi.

00:54.600 --> 01:00.920
He's one of the first Western Sahaja Yogis I met.

01:04.080 --> 01:09.560
Today I will tell you about the Nabhi Chakra which deals

01:09.720 --> 01:13.400
with this honesty of seeking.

01:15.680 --> 01:21.040
Nabhi Chakra is the center which controls

01:21.200 --> 01:25.720
or manifests outside in the gross as

01:27.560 --> 01:35.200
Solar Plexus. Nabhi Chakra has two sides: one is the left,

01:35.360 --> 01:39.720
another the right, and one in the center.

01:41.760 --> 01:45.520
So on the left hand side is the Gruha Lakshmi,

01:45.720 --> 01:49.440
on the right hand side is the Raja Lakshmi or Gaja Lakshmi

01:49.720 --> 01:55.960
and in the center is the Lakshmi which ascends into Mahalakshmi.

02:03.640 --> 02:09.480
When the seeking starts,

02:11.960 --> 02:18.440
a human being first starts seeking food.

02:19.960 --> 02:23.800
Food is very important for all the animals.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.880
If they have no food

02:30.440 --> 02:35.440
then they cannot exist.

02:35.600 --> 02:39.640
So the seeking starts with food,

02:40.120 --> 02:46.560
and when the shelter is sought, they try to find the water.

02:52.840 --> 02:57.960
So this center is made of water

03:00.800 --> 03:11.320
and in this center resides the Deity of Shri Vishnu or Narayana;

03:15.360 --> 03:23.680
and His power, as I told you, is Lakshmi and then Mahalakshmi.

03:25.040 --> 03:28.120
You will find out in Sahaja Yoga

03:28.280 --> 03:35.960
that gradually you start developing one power and then the other.

03:37.120 --> 03:42.000
Everyone who comes to Sahaja Yoga, if they are truthful

03:42.160 --> 03:47.520
and not involved with any wrong things,

03:48.200 --> 03:52.200
then definitely they are helped in Lakshmi Tattwa,

03:52.360 --> 03:55.320
means their well-being is looked after.

03:55.520 --> 03:59.480
As Krishna has said, "yogakshema vahaamya."

03:59.680 --> 04:03.440
So He looks after the kshema part of it.

04:03.600 --> 04:06.560
Everyone who has been to Sahaja Yoga

04:06.720 --> 04:08.720
has been helped miraculously

04:08.960 --> 04:13.400
also in the Lakshmi Tattwa, that means materially.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.640
In so many ways they are helped,

04:15.840 --> 04:18.120
that one has to just see for themselves

04:18.280 --> 04:21.520
how these miracles take place.

04:22.240 --> 04:31.720
An example is of a villager who had a small little holding of land

04:31.960 --> 04:38.560
and he was living hand to mouth every day.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.960
When he came to Me, after some time I found

04:43.120 --> 04:44.960
he would bring one garland,

04:45.120 --> 04:47.640
big garland, for Me every evening.

04:47.800 --> 04:52.040
And he was away in the village every day he would attend My program.

04:52.280 --> 04:57.840
I was quite surprised that how could he afford it, and I asked him,

04:58.000 --> 05:01.680
"How can you afford a garland for Me every day?

05:01.840 --> 05:04.560
You shouldn't bring it, it's not proper."

05:05.600 --> 05:07.520
So he said, "Mother, You know everything."

05:07.680 --> 05:09.160
I said, "Why, what happened?"

05:09.320 --> 05:15.120
He said, "I have a plot of land next to mine

05:15.280 --> 05:18.760
which we never used because it was absolutely a barren land -

05:18.920 --> 05:24.840
little bit, not much big land, but a small land, piece of land.

05:25.360 --> 05:28.800
And after Realization I used to always go

05:28.960 --> 05:32.240
walk over it bare feet to plough this little

05:32.560 --> 05:35.680
piece of land that I had.

05:35.880 --> 05:40.080
After some time when I was coming here after that,

05:40.240 --> 05:43.720
one gentleman came to see me and he said that

05:43.880 --> 05:47.080
“This piece of land that you have is very precious.“

05:47.240 --> 05:50.320
I said, “What's the problem?” He said that

05:50.480 --> 05:58.960
“I have a kiln of bricks, and I have seen that even

05:59.160 --> 06:07.200
by chance – Sahaja - we mixed a little clay from this soil,

06:07.360 --> 06:12.320
from this part of the land that you have,

06:12.480 --> 06:17.480
and we found that our bricks have become so good and so strong

06:17.640 --> 06:21.480
that we would like to purchase this clay from you

06:21.640 --> 06:25.200
at the price of seers."

06:25.640 --> 06:29.520
And that's how he started getting money sufficient for him

06:29.680 --> 06:34.960
and he became much better off.

06:35.160 --> 06:39.320
But in Sahaja Yoga one has to remember you don't go to extremes,

06:39.480 --> 06:41.000
in any principle.

06:41.160 --> 06:45.640
That is one thing people should know, that you don't go to extremes.

06:46.200 --> 06:49.360
You don't become extremely rich.

06:49.960 --> 06:52.880
I've seen those people who are extremely rich,

06:53.040 --> 06:55.520
when they come to Sahaja Yoga, they are a big headache,

06:55.680 --> 06:57.280
very big headache.

06:57.480 --> 07:02.440
If they are sick, if you cure them of their heart trouble,

07:03.120 --> 07:05.520
then they try to possess you.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.960
They will get all the heart patients, they will get

07:08.120 --> 07:09.800
all kinds of patients to you,

07:09.960 --> 07:12.760
you go on tolerating it, they try to possess you.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.120
They immediately start talking about their cures

07:15.280 --> 07:18.040
to everyone, they publish in papers, this thing, that thing,

07:18.200 --> 07:21.880
it's impossible. And they just try to overpower you.

07:22.040 --> 07:23.880
Without any appointment they'll arrive

07:24.040 --> 07:26.840
and they would expect you to attend to them immediately,

07:26.960 --> 07:28.800
it's terrible.

07:30.960 --> 07:35.080
And then they’ll send all their relations for cure

07:35.240 --> 07:36.960
and you have to show all patience,

07:37.120 --> 07:40.120
all their friends, they become like agents.

07:40.760 --> 07:46.720
All their patients, all their relations, all their friends,

07:46.880 --> 07:50.360
they want to oblige them and spare

07:50.520 --> 07:54.480
no love, no affection, nothing further.

07:56.080 --> 07:59.280
The Sahaja Yogis, if they try

07:59.520 --> 08:02.240
to say that “No, you shouldn't do like that and all that,"

08:02.400 --> 08:04.200
they feel insulted.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.920
And they all try curing much faster

08:10.040 --> 08:11.480
than anybody else does.

08:11.640 --> 08:14.680
They themselves are weak, they are sick people themselves,

08:14.840 --> 08:16.800
heart patient, this patient, that,

08:16.960 --> 08:19.400
but if you tell them, “Don't cure,” they'll feel bad.

08:19.560 --> 08:21.080
If you don't tell them, they'll get sick

08:21.240 --> 08:23.120
and you'll have another problem.

08:23.280 --> 08:26.480
They never try to understand Sahaja Yoga in it's big way.

08:26.640 --> 08:34.080
They just want to see it according to their own way of ego

08:34.440 --> 08:38.360
that they have accumulated with their money,

08:38.520 --> 08:42.320
and they never know how they go on hurting

08:43.040 --> 08:48.320
everyone by overpowering Me all the time.

08:48.480 --> 08:52.520
It's very amazing, whenever I cure a rich man,

08:52.680 --> 08:55.640
I've been wanting to run away from that person.

08:55.800 --> 08:59.120
I would never go to their house, I would not like to eat in their house.

08:59.280 --> 09:01.360
It's a very bad thing.

09:03.640 --> 09:08.520
So too much of riches is also not okay

09:08.680 --> 09:11.920
because it gives you a tremendous

09:12.080 --> 09:13.680
ego that you don't see yourself,

09:13.840 --> 09:16.440
and anybody tries to say anything protect oneself,

09:16.600 --> 09:20.720
then such a person feels insulted or humiliated.

09:21.040 --> 09:25.680
Not only that, but they try to hold Me and hold the whole thing

09:25.840 --> 09:30.600
according to their business ways which is impossible.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.200
See, they have to gain money,

09:32.360 --> 09:35.680
they have another attitude because they are miserly.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.960
I don't have to earn money or anything.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.920
If I am doing anything, I’m, really, in a way,

09:41.120 --> 09:43.320
I'm obliging. Isn't it?

09:43.480 --> 09:46.760
But they will force on Me all their rules and regulations, everything,

09:46.920 --> 09:49.480
without having their own discipline.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.320
So very rich people in Sahaja Yoga

09:52.480 --> 09:56.640
so far have been extremely troublesome,

09:56.800 --> 10:00.120
I should say, to Me and to the whole organization.

10:00.280 --> 10:02.640
They are very narrow-minded.

10:02.800 --> 10:08.280
They cannot see the big vision that I have before Me.

10:08.760 --> 10:12.560
Whatever little ideas they have about themselves and about their

10:12.720 --> 10:17.200
own thinking, reading, they will try to push onto Sahaja Yoga.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.040
It's not My experience once, but many a times.

10:20.200 --> 10:24.920
Then somehow or other it so happens that they drop out.

10:25.520 --> 10:29.720
So, too much richness gives you a tremendous ego, worse than

10:29.880 --> 10:33.560
even, I would say, a bulldog.

10:33.720 --> 10:37.040
It’s impossible for a rich man to see

10:37.200 --> 10:42.160
that all these riches are outside him. They are not inside him.

10:42.600 --> 10:47.360
He has to be rich in heart to understand compassion.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.840
Compassion doesn't mean that you give alms to others,

10:50.960 --> 10:54.600
or if you give money to others, it's not that.

10:54.760 --> 10:58.680
On the contrary, you just have beggars by doing that.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.640
Compassion is that works,

11:03.720 --> 11:06.920
compassion is that flows,

11:07.400 --> 11:10.200
compassion is that manifests.

11:10.360 --> 11:13.960
It is not in compassion where you can make it materialize it,

11:14.160 --> 11:17.320
“All right, come along I'll give you a hundred rupees.”

11:17.640 --> 11:22.160
On the contrary, giving somebody a hundred rupees is the worst thing.

11:22.520 --> 11:25.960
I have tried this with some Sahaja Yogis who were with Me.

11:26.120 --> 11:29.600
I tried to give them some money some time as they were very poor.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.280
They became horrid.

11:34.320 --> 11:37.720
Some of them started drinking,

11:37.880 --> 11:40.200
some of them took to some other ways and they became

11:40.360 --> 11:42.880
sort of addicted to money. It was impossible.

11:43.040 --> 11:46.960
And they tried to spoil as many Sahaj Yogis as they could.

11:49.240 --> 11:54.400
So such people if they come, it's impossible to manage them.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.840
They are not Sahaja Yogis because they are asahaja.

11:57.960 --> 12:01.440
They are still sticking to the idea that they have so much money,

12:01.600 --> 12:06.080
that they are so rich and they can overpower everyone with money.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.360
Not Me, I'm sorry.

12:11.880 --> 12:15.160
But only thing I feel sorry for them

12:15.320 --> 12:19.400
that they cannot get to God.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.600
There is no honesty of seeking in them,

12:23.800 --> 12:26.640
there is no honesty of seeking.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.760
The elite people whom I have addressed

12:29.920 --> 12:32.360
so many places like this, because

12:32.520 --> 12:36.480
some people whom I have cured wanted Me to address the elite,

12:36.640 --> 12:41.160
so-called. I think they are elated, to Me what they are.

12:41.320 --> 12:44.320
They don't want to be in Sahaja Yoga.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.760
They are already eliminated, I sometimes feel.

12:46.920 --> 12:50.880
Thousands of them I've addressed, I've wasted My time with them.

12:51.000 --> 12:56.080
They are good for nothing, absolutely empty people.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.760
They are very happy because they have a few cars,

13:00.920 --> 13:03.640
or some houses or something like that.

13:03.800 --> 13:08.600
I too have all these things, I would say so-called riches.

13:08.760 --> 13:11.960
I have always seen from My father's side

13:12.160 --> 13:14.120
and from My husband's side.

13:14.280 --> 13:18.360
I don't understand what is there to be proud of this emptiness.

13:18.520 --> 13:20.760
But human beings are such,

13:20.960 --> 13:24.600
a empty vessel makes a big sound,

13:24.760 --> 13:30.200
in the same way, an empty rich man makes a very big sound.

13:34.440 --> 13:38.920
Not that the very poor are also good,

13:39.080 --> 13:42.200
because those who are extremely poor

13:42.520 --> 13:44.680
are busy with their food problems.

13:44.840 --> 13:47.920
They have little, little problems and their values are still have to

13:48.080 --> 13:49.600
come up to a point.

13:49.760 --> 13:54.240
It's only in the middle you can work out Sahaja Yoga better.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.840
Those who are extremely rich and proud

13:57.040 --> 13:59.880
cannot come to Sahaja Yoga easily.

14:00.040 --> 14:03.480
Those who are very poor also cannot come to Sahaja Yoga.

14:03.640 --> 14:09.760
But when this middle part of the river is enriched

14:09.920 --> 14:12.480
and starts flowing well, then it spreads on the sides

14:12.640 --> 14:14.280
and then it can engulf.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.320
But you cannot  start it the other way round. I have tried.

14:17.480 --> 14:20.360
I have tried both ways and I have told you what happened.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.200
Whom I gave money,

14:22.360 --> 14:24.880
whom I tried to help through giving money

14:25.040 --> 14:28.680
became wayward, useless, frivolous people,

14:28.840 --> 14:33.560
got lost to Sahaja Yoga. And those whom

14:33.720 --> 14:36.560
I thought were moneyed and satisfied people

14:36.720 --> 14:40.920
had another role to play is to possess Me all the time,

14:41.080 --> 14:43.720
to use Me all the time whenever they wanted,

14:43.880 --> 14:48.280
for whatever purpose they wanted to use Me.

14:50.440 --> 14:55.760
And they must know, you cannot possess Me, you cannot possess Me,

14:56.080 --> 14:58.600
but this kind of an ignorance still in their minds

14:58.760 --> 15:02.680
is that they can possess God, they can possess everyone.

15:03.440 --> 15:09.920
For such people there are no reasons

15:10.640 --> 15:13.240
to come to Sahaja Yoga, to be very frank.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.200
And even if they come to Sahaja Yog

15:16.360 --> 15:21.080
they have to know that for Mother richness of heart,

15:21.240 --> 15:23.680
understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

15:23.840 --> 15:28.440
humility, non-possessiveness are very important.

15:33.320 --> 15:38.760
In this ascent of yours,

15:38.920 --> 15:42.960
money is not important at all.

15:43.280 --> 15:46.520
Even if you are poor or rich, you get your Realization.

15:46.680 --> 15:52.280
For example, I went to Maharashtra, most of them are,

15:53.080 --> 15:57.480
I would say, very poor people in the sense that

15:57.640 --> 16:01.160
they are not middle class at all. They are not educated,

16:01.320 --> 16:04.720
they are sometimes factory workers

16:04.880 --> 16:10.480
or they have small holdings. Not very rich.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.800
But they are very good Sahaja Yogis, excellent Sahaja Yogis.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.960
They have such beautiful eyes

16:18.120 --> 16:22.640
and such beautiful feeling and such compassion

16:22.800 --> 16:30.160
that Lakshmi Tattwa is absolutely balanced in them.

16:30.880 --> 16:35.360
You know that Lakshmi is shown to be a lady,

16:35.520 --> 16:39.560
and lady who is a mother.

16:39.720 --> 16:43.400
Mother doesn't care whether you are rich or poor.

16:43.560 --> 16:46.960
If her one son is rich and another is poor,

16:47.120 --> 16:50.680
she'll pay more attention to the poor and ask the rich

16:50.840 --> 16:53.720
to give his money to the poor also.

16:53.880 --> 16:57.280
She is not bothered. If somebody is in need,

16:57.480 --> 17:00.760
she will be the first to help the person who needs.

17:00.920 --> 17:05.440
Now this is a spiritual thing in the spiritual life.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.520
The person who is a real seeker,

17:07.680 --> 17:13.080
who is a truthful seeker, the Mother will go out of the way

17:14.080 --> 17:18.480
to be with that person. And those who are not honest about it,

17:18.640 --> 17:22.640
Mother will try somehow or other cut them short.

17:26.960 --> 17:32.520
The problem that lies with human beings is

17:32.680 --> 17:36.600
that they do not know what they want.

17:36.840 --> 17:40.000
They think they want first of all money.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.840
But those who have money,

17:41.960 --> 17:43.480
they think they must have power.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.760
If they have too much money, they think that they must go into politics

17:46.920 --> 17:48.760
because they have had no power.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.480
Then they fail in politics,

17:50.680 --> 17:53.720
or say they become too much in politics, whatever it is,

17:53.880 --> 17:58.560
then they want love from their children which they can't get,

17:58.720 --> 18:02.520
because they are too busy or something like that.

18:02.840 --> 18:05.920
So they don't know what they want.

18:06.840 --> 18:10.440
Those who believe that by having money will be better off,

18:10.600 --> 18:13.280
should listen to all these people who have come from affluent countries

18:13.440 --> 18:16.400
and they will tell you how things have gone wrong there,

18:16.560 --> 18:18.920
how people are ruined, what's going wrong with them,

18:19.080 --> 18:22.760
absolutely they are in a bad shape.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.320
You cannot call them human beings

18:26.480 --> 18:29.760
because they are so cruel, they kill even their own children,

18:29.920 --> 18:32.640
and that society tolerates such people.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.520
In India if you hear somebody killing a child,

18:35.680 --> 18:38.880
I have never heard so far in the sixty years of My life,

18:39.040 --> 18:43.120
but supposing you hear someone has killed his daughter or son,

18:43.320 --> 18:45.560
nobody will ever look at that person.

18:45.720 --> 18:48.680
He will not be allowed in the society, nobody will even

18:48.840 --> 18:53.720
give any girl in the marriage to

18:54.280 --> 18:58.840
his daughter or a son. He'll be absolutely barred from the society.

18:59.080 --> 19:04.080
No one can think of such a relationship between children and parents.

19:04.240 --> 19:06.600
And then there are funny relationships also,

19:06.760 --> 19:08.240
it's something so absurd,

19:08.400 --> 19:11.840
on both the sides on cruelty and on morality,

19:11.960 --> 19:15.800
they are so absurd, it's impossible to understand.

19:15.960 --> 19:20.640
So money has given this ego and they say, “What's wrong?

19:21.240 --> 19:24.840
What’s wrong?” It's absolutely malignant attitude.

19:25.000 --> 19:26.880
When you say, “What's wrong?” that means

19:27.040 --> 19:30.800
you do not want to keep your relationship with the whole.

19:31.720 --> 19:34.240
You do not want to keep your relationship

19:34.400 --> 19:41.960
with the Primordial One, the One who has you,

19:42.520 --> 19:46.600
everyone within Himself. You are part and parcel of the whole,

19:46.760 --> 19:49.680
and how can you say, “What's wrong? I do what I like.”

19:49.840 --> 19:53.840
You just become like a malignant cell.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.280
So at the Nabhi Chakra one has to know

19:58.440 --> 20:03.120
that one should not hanker after money too much.

20:03.440 --> 20:06.800
Now those who hanker too much after money,

20:07.760 --> 20:14.120
may develop their right side better, they may have money, no doubt.

20:15.120 --> 20:20.280
But they miss their left side. Left side is Gruha Lakshmi,

20:20.720 --> 20:22.840
they have no Gruha Lakshmi in their house.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.800
They are very hectic people, they run about,

20:25.960 --> 20:28.960
they run the rat race, they get heart attacks,

20:29.120 --> 20:32.600
if not heart attacks, they will get leukemia,

20:32.760 --> 20:37.920
they'll get diabetes, liver, all such things,

20:39.920 --> 20:44.120
because their attention is on money and not on God.

20:44.280 --> 20:48.080
So either you are on the right or on the left.

20:50.760 --> 20:52.840
Those who are very emotional people,

20:52.960 --> 20:56.640
extremely emotional, more worried about their family;

20:56.800 --> 20:58.680
for them family is everything,

20:58.840 --> 21:01.480
the relations are everything, they are like that,

21:01.640 --> 21:04.000
they may not have so much of Lakshmi because they distribute

21:04.160 --> 21:07.800
all the Lakshmi. But still they are better people.

21:07.960 --> 21:10.320
But sometimes

21:10.480 --> 21:13.720
such people who sacrifice so much for others,

21:13.880 --> 21:17.160
give up everything that they have, can become crazy

21:17.320 --> 21:21.080
because they’ll find people do not reciprocate,

21:21.240 --> 21:23.080
they do not return their love,

21:23.240 --> 21:25.240
they do not understand what they have done.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.760
So going to the extreme of helping others can cause

21:28.920 --> 21:32.680
trouble to the person who does this job, and also trouble to people

21:32.840 --> 21:34.520
who have taken free money from him,

21:34.680 --> 21:38.120
because if you distribute free money to people what will happen?

21:38.280 --> 21:43.160
I'll give you a simple example of America helping India.

21:44.240 --> 21:46.400
When Americans helped India,

21:46.560 --> 21:49.080
they thought they were doing a great favor to Indians,

21:49.240 --> 21:51.760
which was wrong. Because whatever they did

21:51.920 --> 21:55.480
whatever they did was lost in the wilderness.

21:55.640 --> 21:58.880
Nobody tried to maintain it, it was free.

22:00.360 --> 22:04.320
But by giving that they showed the contempt,

22:05.040 --> 22:08.880
and when they gave some wheat and rice to India

22:09.040 --> 22:11.200
there was no grace about it, because

22:11.360 --> 22:13.960
then put some sort of a seed in it

22:14.160 --> 22:17.440
which creted two horrible things in the villages.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.400
One was called as congress grass

22:20.560 --> 22:22.720
because it came from America.

22:22.880 --> 22:28.600
And another was called as a mad acacia.

22:28.760 --> 22:31.680
Babool, as we call it, mad babool.

22:31.840 --> 22:35.120
These trees have grown so much in the villages

22:35.280 --> 22:37.160
that they don't know what to do with them.

22:37.320 --> 22:40.960
They have such big, big thorns that anyone who is stung by them

22:41.120 --> 22:44.040
can even die. They are very poisonous

22:44.200 --> 22:47.240
and if the children get it, they get such poisonous problems

22:47.400 --> 22:50.480
that they cannot be cured.

22:50.640 --> 22:53.440
This is how American government has helped us.

22:53.600 --> 22:57.360
Now who's going to tell them what you have done so ungraciously?

22:57.520 --> 23:02.080
It was better to starve than to get any help from anyone.

23:02.280 --> 23:06.960
Long time back I had said that it is better to starve in this country

23:07.160 --> 23:10.480
than to get any help from these wretched, horrible

23:10.640 --> 23:14.280
Western countries who think no end of themselves.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.280
You just pamper their ego for nothing at all.

23:17.440 --> 23:20.920
What have they got? They have just plastic affluence.

23:21.080 --> 23:25.320
But this ego out of money makes them so stupid

23:25.480 --> 23:28.760
that they don't know what's happening in their own country.

23:28.920 --> 23:31.760
How their country’s going down in every way.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.400
How their people are going down. Either they are in

23:34.560 --> 23:37.040
fear or they are abandoned.

23:37.320 --> 23:39.360
Otherwise they are communist

23:39.520 --> 23:42.640
or they are so-called capitalist

23:42.800 --> 23:44.960
where they are just abandoned.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.120
If you go and see that country,

23:47.280 --> 23:50.560
I mean you can't sit like this anywhere and talk in the outside,

23:50.720 --> 23:53.840
somebody might come and murder somebody.

23:53.960 --> 23:56.120
If you walk in the dark you can be murdered.

23:56.280 --> 24:01.360
In America, so called advanced country of America, in New York City.

24:03.600 --> 24:06.920
So this kind of riches we are trying to aspire, especially

24:07.080 --> 24:11.720
people in Delhi are very anxious to aspire lot of money.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.480
I don't know why Punjabis, Gujaratis

24:15.640 --> 24:17.560
and Maarwadis have taken to this.

24:17.720 --> 24:20.960
Maarwadis are another style.

24:21.480 --> 24:25.360
How the Punjabis and the Gujaratis

24:25.520 --> 24:28.880
are trying to acquire the money.

24:29.040 --> 24:31.360
And when I see them abroad I

24:31.520 --> 24:34.640
just don't know if they are anywhere near India.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.240
Horrid people they.

24:36.440 --> 24:41.600
They have no culture left in them that is Indian.

24:41.760 --> 24:44.840
They are absolutely outward.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.320
They think no end of themselves,

24:46.480 --> 24:50.160
they think they have reached the heavens.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.480
Then if you see their Nabhi Chakra,

24:52.640 --> 24:56.040
you'll be amazed, all of them suffer from horrible livers,

24:56.200 --> 25:00.800
high blood pressure, diabetes, heart attacks

25:00.960 --> 25:04.320
and they drink like fish, especially Sardargis.

25:04.480 --> 25:09.960
I was surprised who are supposed to be in the name of God,

25:10.120 --> 25:13.360
they drink like fish.

25:13.520 --> 25:16.240
They are very particular about wearing a Puggadi and a Dhari,

25:16.400 --> 25:18.400
but while drinking they don't mind.

25:18.560 --> 25:22.160
Every Sardargi you go to has a big bar in his house,

25:22.320 --> 25:23.360
where even a lord

25:23.520 --> 25:26.760
does not have because it is regarded as very vulgar in England.

25:26.920 --> 25:30.720
Without learning any aesthetics of that country,

25:30.880 --> 25:36.840
they have become just like a agriculture there is no culture

25:39.560 --> 25:41.480
is the fact,

25:41.640 --> 25:43.920
this is what money has done to them, they have

25:44.080 --> 25:46.560
no respect for themselves.

25:46.720 --> 25:49.080
So this Lakshmi Tattwa is to be balanced.

25:49.240 --> 25:52.840
Same about these Gujaratis who have gone.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.160
Another kind lives here, the Maarwadis.

25:55.320 --> 25:58.480
Less said the better about these horrible Maarwadis.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.440
I don't think anyone of them will ever get Realization

26:01.600 --> 26:05.040
or a place in the Kingdom of God.

26:06.640 --> 26:09.680
They are blood suckers.

26:11.040 --> 26:14.080
They are not human beings. For money's sake, they'll

26:14.240 --> 26:16.520
suck the blood like juice, suck the blood,

26:16.720 --> 26:20.720
and now they had a nice time.

26:23.120 --> 26:28.200
This is not a world for you to seek money.

26:28.360 --> 26:31.280
You have come on this earth as a human being to seek God,

26:31.440 --> 26:34.960
to seek your Spirit, to be one with your Self,

26:35.120 --> 26:37.960
to be in that peaceful place

26:38.120 --> 26:42.840
which is the Kingdom of God, which is the Kingdom of Heaven,

26:42.960 --> 26:48.480
and not to jump into a mire which looks very beautiful

26:49.360 --> 26:52.800
but is not really beautiful.

26:52.960 --> 26:56.640
It's agonizing, it's terrorizing.

26:56.800 --> 26:59.760
People can't sleep if they have too much money,

26:59.920 --> 27:01.760
because they don't know what to do with that.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.400
Here also all those who have got money,

27:04.560 --> 27:08.240
they don't know when the income tax will come on them.

27:08.400 --> 27:13.760
I have solved My income tax problem by having no income at all.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.320
I have no income, no income tax,

27:17.480 --> 27:20.920
so I'm not worried about the Income Tax Commissioner.

27:21.080 --> 27:24.040
He cannot control Me.

27:24.960 --> 27:27.800
Best is not to have more income

27:27.960 --> 27:29.640
that is to be taxed, otherwise you’ll have

27:29.800 --> 27:32.840
to have another income tax

27:34.040 --> 27:37.080
lawyer that My brother is. I told him,

27:37.120 --> 27:42.200
“I don't need you at all, all My life, thank you very much.”

27:42.200 --> 27:45.480
You get so absolutely free,

27:45.680 --> 27:49.840
on top of the world if you have no income.

27:50.960 --> 27:58.360
Like if you want to solve your car problem, never learn driving.

27:58.520 --> 28:04.680
Somebody drives you down or nothing, you can walk with your feet.

28:05.400 --> 28:08.440
The accumulation of all these nonsensical things

28:08.600 --> 28:12.480
have caused us all this tension, so-called:

28:13.680 --> 28:17.240
“How much we have to pay, what is the income tax,

28:17.400 --> 28:20.640
tomorrow the police is going to come in my house?”

28:20.800 --> 28:22.600
If they come to Me I'll say, “All right,

28:22.760 --> 28:26.200
have everything that you can. Nothing there,

28:26.360 --> 28:30.440
certain bills which I have not paid, that's all.”

28:30.600 --> 28:33.480
Just let them pay.

28:34.720 --> 28:38.000
One has to live with complete freedom in this world.

28:38.160 --> 28:41.880
And to achieve that freedom, one has to know that

28:42.040 --> 28:45.760
the priorities should be all right. If money is your priority,

28:45.920 --> 28:52.080
you have it. No, not Me. If you want to give Me money,

28:52.240 --> 28:55.360
“No Sir,” I won't at any cost.

28:55.520 --> 29:01.160
You can give Me flowers, this, that, all right, but no money at all.

29:01.640 --> 29:07.440
I don't want to know about money at all, it's a headache.

29:09.040 --> 29:17.960
In the same way, we do not realize that having relationships -

29:18.120 --> 29:24.320
brother, sister or son, this and that - is another big headache.

29:25.400 --> 29:28.160
That doesn't mean that you should start beating them,

29:28.320 --> 29:34.200
but people can sell their country for the sake of their children.

29:35.720 --> 29:39.920
It’s a very dangerous thing, horrible,

29:40.080 --> 29:42.520
that kind of an attachment, the mamatva (ownership).

29:42.680 --> 29:45.000
This is my son, finished.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.880
If he's your son then you can murder anyone you feel like,

29:48.040 --> 29:50.560
you can do what you like because he is your son.

29:50.720 --> 29:54.960
He is not somebody's son whom you are murdering?

29:55.800 --> 29:58.240
This mamatva that comes - “My husband.”

29:58.400 --> 30:00.760
Specially our Indian women.

30:00.920 --> 30:05.720
“My husband” immediately starts problem.

30:08.920 --> 30:15.920
All this comes out of ignorance. Of course, love has to be there.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.840
But love never gives you attachment,

30:19.960 --> 30:22.800
because it is wise, it is wisdom.

30:23.000 --> 30:27.960
Supposing in a tree the sap of the tree

30:28.160 --> 30:33.320
goes and gets fixed in one fruit because it loves. “It's mine.”

30:33.480 --> 30:36.600
Then what happens to the rest of the tree? It dies

30:36.760 --> 30:40.120
and that fruit also dies.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.240
So this mamatva has to go out.

30:45.400 --> 30:49.160
But by telling it will not go,

30:49.320 --> 30:51.440
by just advising it will not go.

30:51.600 --> 30:54.840
Even if you suffer, I have seen so many people coming to Me,

30:54.960 --> 30:58.760
“My own father deceived me.

30:58.920 --> 31:03.080
My own son deceived me.” I said, “Which one is your own?

31:03.240 --> 31:07.160
The one who deceived you is not your own.”

31:08.680 --> 31:10.400
“My husband.”

31:10.560 --> 31:15.200
There are some ladies who eat My head out of their husbands.

31:15.360 --> 31:20.440
“My husband did this, my husband did this, my husband did this.”

31:20.600 --> 31:24.760
Baba, why don't you hit him hard and finish with it?

31:26.640 --> 31:32.840
But it's so much accepted,

31:33.000 --> 31:36.720
this mamatva, this attachment.

31:36.880 --> 31:43.240
Attachment to money, attachment to people, attachment to this

31:43.400 --> 31:51.240
is nothing but a hook which hooks you to baser levels.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.800
You have to rise above,

31:55.960 --> 32:01.720
and then you really enjoy the beauty of richness.

32:02.240 --> 32:06.040
As I told you the other day, I see all beautiful things.

32:06.200 --> 32:07.760
It's nice I don't possess them.

32:07.960 --> 32:10.560
See now these carpets are spread here.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.960
If they were Mine, I should worry, “Oh God, now

32:14.160 --> 32:16.720
I hope they are not going to be spoilt.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.840
I hope nobody sits on them.

32:20.000 --> 32:24.800
I hope they are insured, so nobody runs away with that.”

32:24.960 --> 32:29.440
But when they don't belong to Me, I'm enjoying them better.

32:29.600 --> 32:33.160
Other people's things is a better idea.

32:33.680 --> 32:40.120
This myth carries us to such an extent of stupidity

32:41.520 --> 32:45.880
that sometimes I feel whether these human beings are human beings,

32:46.040 --> 32:48.760
or they are their possessions.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.840
Their Spirit is lost,

32:52.320 --> 32:57.120
everything is lost, they're not bothered.

32:57.360 --> 33:01.960
But if their little position is lost, they weep and wail,

33:02.160 --> 33:07.240
as if they are dead, their forefathers are dead hundred times.

33:10.520 --> 33:14.880
But people like Me are just batchas, emperors.

33:15.040 --> 33:22.520
They are not bothered. To them comfort cannot capture,

33:22.680 --> 33:27.040
they don’t need any comfort. If you have comfort

33:27.200 --> 33:30.520
it crawls upon you, it makes you a slave, too.

33:30.680 --> 33:35.400
If you seek comfort you are in for enslavement,

33:35.560 --> 33:40.120
take it from Me. Any kind of comfort.

33:42.320 --> 33:45.560
It's only human beings who can become really so crazy.

33:45.720 --> 33:50.280
No animal can become. There is another type of a comfort,

33:50.440 --> 33:55.760
is that a mental idea

33:55.920 --> 33:58.400
that everybody must appreciate,

33:58.560 --> 34:02.120
and that you should be able to overpower others.

34:02.280 --> 34:06.240
This also comes I think from Nabhi Chakra.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.040
Is a kind of a feeling

34:08.200 --> 34:10.640
that you should be able to overpower many people,

34:10.800 --> 34:11.960
they should look at you.

34:12.120 --> 34:15.440
These days in London there are women who are suffering from

34:15.600 --> 34:19.840
a funny disease called anorexia, where they just don't eat.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.560
Women just don't eat because they should be thin and skinny.

34:23.720 --> 34:27.520
For what? For what you should be thin and skinny?

34:27.720 --> 34:31.560
Because you look attractive, but for what?

34:33.120 --> 34:36.680
I don't think skinny people look attractive by any chance.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.800
Horrible they are. They create only pity

34:39.960 --> 34:44.880
and you feel you know repulsive about the whole stuff.

34:45.040 --> 34:48.400
Once a beauty queen came to see Me.

34:48.600 --> 34:52.080
I thought she was a T.B. patient.

34:53.640 --> 34:56.200
And I said, “You look all right but

34:56.400 --> 34:58.400
it seems you are a T.B. patient.”

34:58.560 --> 35:02.680
She said, “No Mother, I've got a beauty prize.” “Yes?

35:03.080 --> 35:05.400
Who were the people? Doctors must have given it

35:05.560 --> 35:08.760
because they want some patients there.”

35:08.920 --> 35:10.440
This is the trouble,

35:10.600 --> 35:14.400
we go out of the way to trouble our Nabhi,

35:14.560 --> 35:17.600
not to eat your food, fasting.

35:17.760 --> 35:22.600
If you want to fast this life, next life you will not have any food.

35:22.760 --> 35:26.720
Thank you very much. No food.

35:26.880 --> 35:28.320
Fasting? All right,

35:28.520 --> 35:31.080
you’ll have a permanent fasting. What do you say?

35:31.240 --> 35:35.480
You don't have to do any fasting. Why do you want to fast?

35:35.640 --> 35:37.560
And even if you want to fast

35:37.720 --> 35:42.480
because you want to change the timing or maybe

35:42.640 --> 35:44.240
for your health's sake, it's all right.

35:44.400 --> 35:48.320
But why in the name of God you want to malign Me?

35:48.480 --> 35:51.320
You have got everything to eat and you don’t want to eat.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.800
Those who have got food to eat, they don’t want to eat.

35:53.960 --> 35:59.040
Next life they become poor and then they blame the rich.

35:59.200 --> 36:02.960
But in last life you'd been wanted to fast,

36:03.560 --> 36:08.680
so this life you are not given any food, because you asked for it.

36:10.200 --> 36:13.400
And that is how also the Nabhi Chakra gets you twisted,

36:13.560 --> 36:15.800
when you fast like mad.

36:15.960 --> 36:18.960
There is no need to fast in the name of God.

36:19.120 --> 36:24.520
God has given you all the wealth, all the beauty,

36:24.720 --> 36:28.240
all the love. Actually in Sahaja Yoga

36:28.400 --> 36:32.760
if you fast in My name, I think it's horrible

36:32.920 --> 36:36.120
because if you want to trouble your Mother

36:36.280 --> 36:40.240
or to make Her uneasy, or to take a revenge on Her,

36:40.400 --> 36:42.360
then you say, “Mother, I'm not going to eat my food.”

36:42.520 --> 36:45.520
Then Mother is finished. That's the best way to conquer Her.

36:45.680 --> 36:48.440
To say, “Mother I'm not going to eat my food.”

36:48.600 --> 36:51.720
So this kind of a mad fasting

36:51.880 --> 36:55.880
is also very bad for your Nabhi and when you do that

36:56.040 --> 36:58.880
then you have a problem because you are invaded

36:59.040 --> 37:04.880
by your left-sided, what you call, beyond

37:05.920 --> 37:10.880
the Ida Nadi, you have the collective subconscious;

37:11.040 --> 37:14.520
and you are invaded by them.

37:14.680 --> 37:20.880
And you are in for trouble, physically, mentally, emotionally.

37:21.680 --> 37:25.640
And mostly those people who fast are very hot tempered.

37:25.800 --> 37:29.840
The day they are fasting day is there, never go near them.

37:29.960 --> 37:34.280
Because they are already planning what they are going to eat.

37:36.920 --> 37:40.480
And in the morning they plan and they don't get it,

37:40.640 --> 37:44.160
so they are very angry for that part.

37:44.960 --> 37:48.200
All these asahaja things are not going to help you.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.760
You have to be normal people.

37:50.920 --> 37:54.320
You don't have to put up into tension yourself for Sahaja Yoga,

37:54.400 --> 37:57.760
Nothing. Be normal. Be nice people.

37:57.960 --> 37:59.560
Don't torture yourself.

37:59.720 --> 38:02.560
That is one point on the Nabhi on the left hand side

38:02.720 --> 38:07.040
and on the right hand side: don't get into indulgences.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.200
Don't pamper yourself.

38:09.360 --> 38:11.680
Both things are the same for Sahaja Yoga.

38:11.840 --> 38:16.240
Whether you starve or you overeat, is the same.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.880
There is no difference between the two,

38:19.040 --> 38:21.640
because if you are not on the seat,

38:21.800 --> 38:22.920
whether you are on the left

38:23.080 --> 38:26.560
falling on the right, does it make any difference?

38:27.640 --> 38:30.960
So to be on the seat is to be

38:31.160 --> 38:33.560
in the blessings of Shri Lakshmi.

38:33.720 --> 38:37.760
And I have described to you how Shri Lakshmi is a lady

38:37.920 --> 38:43.800
and in Her left hand She has got two lotuses and the right,

38:43.960 --> 38:50.240
one lotus, and right hand another lotus on top, which shows a person

38:50.720 --> 38:54.800
who is balancing. She’s balancing on a lotus.

38:54.960 --> 38:59.360
Imagine. She’s standing on a lotus. That means She is balancing.

39:00.960 --> 39:04.400
And She’s balancing, She’s standing there

39:04.560 --> 39:10.520
and She is holding two lotuses in Her hand showing

39:11.200 --> 39:14.120
that She’s like a lotus.

39:15.800 --> 39:20.440
A person who is a rich man, Lakshmi Pati,

39:20.600 --> 39:25.520
has to be like a lotus, warm, pink, warm.

39:25.680 --> 39:30.320
And even a horrible thing, like

39:36.320 --> 39:39.400
wasp-like thing. I don’t know what you call it in English,

39:39.480 --> 39:41.200
you don’t have that black thing.

39:41.360 --> 39:45.200
We have a very black wasp, you see, which is hard,

39:45.360 --> 39:49.920
hard like nut and has angular thorny legs.

39:50.080 --> 39:54.280
That black thing comes in

39:54.760 --> 39:59.680
and is good for nothing, but it comes in

40:00.720 --> 40:04.240
for the residence, for the ashraya,

40:04.400 --> 40:07.400
the lotus keeps it

40:07.760 --> 40:11.040
on top of it’s corolla, which is a very, very soft thing,

40:11.200 --> 40:12.720
with all love.

40:12.880 --> 40:15.960
And in the night it closes down so that

40:16.120 --> 40:19.120
the poor insect who is just like a nut

40:19.280 --> 40:24.120
should not get any trouble from the outside weather.

40:24.280 --> 40:29.360
Like a mother who takes the child in the armchair,

40:30.000 --> 40:34.040
that love should be there for a Lakshmi Pati.

40:34.200 --> 40:38.320
How many are Lakshmi Pati’s like that? Have you seen any?

40:38.480 --> 40:43.240
If they see somebody who is coming with money propositions,

40:43.400 --> 40:45.400
then they may open their doors.

40:45.560 --> 40:49.000
Otherwise, they have no love for anybody.

40:49.160 --> 40:54.800
For those who come for their ashrayas, for their help,

40:54.960 --> 40:57.560
they are not there.

40:57.720 --> 41:01.680
On the other side are the people

41:04.360 --> 41:11.640
who are so repulsive. They are not like lotus.

41:11.800 --> 41:16.720
There is no fragrance. They are such miserly people

41:16.880 --> 41:21.280
that they stink of miserliness.

41:21.440 --> 41:26.120
While the lotus gives its fragrance

41:26.280 --> 41:30.520
through that mud, to that horrible thing

41:30.680 --> 41:36.520
that even the little worms which crawl upon

41:37.200 --> 41:44.640
those lotus petals smell of this beautiful fragrance.

41:45.640 --> 41:49.440
This is what it has to be. It has to give.

41:49.600 --> 41:52.640
It has to be beautiful. It has to be cozy.

41:52.800 --> 41:55.960
It has to be welcoming.

41:56.120 --> 42:00.440
Then another hand is giving.

42:00.600 --> 42:03.360
The Lakshmi is always giving. She doesn’t receive;

42:03.520 --> 42:05.240
She just gives.

42:05.400 --> 42:07.200
If you are really a Lakshmi Pati

42:07.360 --> 42:11.320
you don’t want to have anything from anyone. You don’t receive.

42:11.480 --> 42:16.760
If you are really rich, who can enrich you more?

42:17.080 --> 42:21.320
What can you give to a person who is fully rich? There is no

42:21.480 --> 42:24.600
way of entering into it now it’s all up to the brim.

42:24.760 --> 42:28.200
He’s rich up to the brim. Then what will you give?

42:28.360 --> 42:30.120
You cannot give anything.

42:30.280 --> 42:33.880
But where you have to give means that he’s a beggar –

42:34.040 --> 42:36.920
he’s still a beggar.

42:37.280 --> 42:40.960
All of these so-called rich people who still are hankering money

42:41.160 --> 42:43.240
are still beggars, they are not rich.

42:43.400 --> 42:46.840
They may think themselves. Empty vessels, but they are not rich

42:46.960 --> 42:50.360
because they are still expecting money.

42:54.760 --> 43:01.760
So, it is important that we should understand,

43:03.720 --> 43:05.520
the money is not the way.

43:05.680 --> 43:07.880
Money takes us away from dharma.

43:08.040 --> 43:11.640
It takes us away from God. It takes us away from reality.

43:11.800 --> 43:15.160
It covers our eyes. We don’t think

43:15.320 --> 43:20.560
that we have to follow a path of righteousness and of virtue

43:20.720 --> 43:23.480
because we think we are rich, God is going to be afraid of us.

43:23.640 --> 43:25.960
We can even purchase Him and can

43:26.120 --> 43:29.000
manage Him by giving some bribes.

43:30.120 --> 43:31.720
That’s not so.

43:32.520 --> 43:36.600
You must face yourself. You have to face yourself.

43:36.760 --> 43:42.320
That it’s not the money that’s going to give you that elation,

43:42.480 --> 43:51.280
that higher life, but it is the love of God,

43:52.040 --> 43:56.720
the honesty of seeking, honesty.

43:56.880 --> 44:02.400
That is the quality of this chakra is the Satya,

44:02.560 --> 44:05.720
Vishnu, is the Satya.

44:05.880 --> 44:09.560
He’s the Narayana. Narayana means Satya.

44:09.720 --> 44:12.600
So there cannot be Satya Narayan, isn’t it?

44:12.760 --> 44:15.960
Narayan is Satya, then how can there be Satya Narayan?

44:16.160 --> 44:19.280
But we have many Satya Narayana Pujas.

44:19.440 --> 44:24.080
For all these Satya Narayanas, Sahaja Yogis are not supposed to go.

44:24.240 --> 44:26.960
They can only go to Narayana Puja

44:27.120 --> 44:31.840
because Satya Narayana is that path which is added to it

44:31.960 --> 44:34.560
for camouflaging, is meant for these

44:34.720 --> 44:39.760
horrible Brahmins who make you pay. For what?

44:42.280 --> 44:46.560
Sahaja Yogis are not allowed to go to Satya Narayana Puja.

44:46.720 --> 44:49.200
They can have Narayana Puja.

44:49.360 --> 44:52.520
And what is Narayana ultimately becomes?

44:52.680 --> 44:54.720
In the Nabhi Chakra

44:54.880 --> 45:01.360
Narayana existed since He was created by the Devi.

45:02.360 --> 45:04.960
And It looks after

45:05.880 --> 45:10.120
the seeking, the nourishing of the seeking like a father,

45:10.280 --> 45:14.920
and then It incarnates again and then It incarnates again

45:15.080 --> 45:19.600
to help our seeking to a higher position and a higher position

45:19.760 --> 45:28.200
till it reaches a point where you start seeking God Almighty.

45:28.360 --> 45:33.640
Then you jump into the Shakti of Mahalakshmi.

45:33.800 --> 45:38.360
Then you are in the hands of Mahalakshmi Shakti.

45:38.520 --> 45:43.400
Means Lakshmi evolves into Mahalakshmi principle.

45:46.880 --> 45:50.840
Now this Mahalakshmi principle resides

45:51.040 --> 45:54.080
in the central path of Sushumna.

45:55.120 --> 46:04.440
And this central path of Sushumna is to be established fully

46:04.720 --> 46:08.120
and awakened when the Kundalini rises.

46:08.200 --> 46:10.400
When the Kundalini does not rise,

46:10.520 --> 46:13.840
this path is kept absolutely black.

46:16.080 --> 46:19.800
It is absolutely black, there is nothing in it

46:20.000 --> 46:22.560
except for the deities

46:22.720 --> 46:27.280
who are lying without any light.

46:27.720 --> 46:32.920
When the Kundalini rises, then only these deities get awakened

46:33.080 --> 46:36.800
and when they get awakened this Sushumna path,

46:36.960 --> 46:44.400
this central path of Mahalakshmi starts acting

46:44.560 --> 46:50.480
as the balancing power, to begin with at the Nabhi chakra.

46:50.640 --> 46:56.440
So Nabhi Chakra is surrounded by ten Gurus, the Prophets

46:56.600 --> 46:58.360
who give you the balance,

46:58.520 --> 47:03.320
who come on this earth again and again to give you balance in life.

47:03.480 --> 47:06.200
They tell you, “don’t do this, don’t do that.”

47:06.360 --> 47:10.640
But we don’t listen, we don’t accept it. We may say

47:10.800 --> 47:13.240
that we follow such guru, such guru. Like,

47:13.400 --> 47:17.280
you know Muslims are. They say, “We follow Mohammed Sahib.”

47:17.440 --> 47:19.240
Now if Mohammed Sahib has said

47:19.400 --> 47:23.360
anything it is that don’t drink, is the thing he said.

47:23.520 --> 47:26.560
But I’ve yet to come across a Muslim who doesn’t drink.

47:26.720 --> 47:30.000
They may not drink in Riyad because they’ll be killed there.

47:30.160 --> 47:32.040
But if they come to London, they drink.

47:32.200 --> 47:35.640
Actually, when My husband went to Saudi Arabia they said,

47:35.800 --> 47:38.960
“You are the only Muslim we have ever come across.”

47:39.120 --> 47:40.280
It’s true.

47:40.480 --> 47:44.880
Whatever is said to them, they do just the opposite of that.

47:45.040 --> 47:47.720
At that time there were no cigarettes, no tobaccos,

47:47.880 --> 47:50.440
so He didn’t say about that so they have found a loophole.

47:50.600 --> 47:55.040
Muslims smoke, doesn’t matter, because Mohammed Sahib never said.

47:55.200 --> 47:57.440
Mohammed Sahib had to take another birth

47:57.600 --> 48:00.840
to come as Guru Nanaka to tell them, “Oh, God.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.960
Now you are smoking this horrible thing has come,

48:05.040 --> 48:07.320
now you don’t smoke.”

48:07.480 --> 48:09.800
But who will accept that Nanaka

48:09.960 --> 48:12.880
and Mohammed Sahib were the same people?

48:13.040 --> 48:20.040
No difference. Same thing it was. We can prove it in Sahaja Yoga.

48:21.800 --> 48:26.720
We can prove it, how important it is that we should know

48:26.880 --> 48:28.960
that they were all the same,

48:29.120 --> 48:32.760
and that they stood for the same thing, but at a period.

48:32.920 --> 48:35.520
Now today you have got ganja,

48:35.680 --> 48:38.200
I don’t know the names also of all these things what you

48:38.360 --> 48:40.560
drink and smoke, God knows what.

48:40.720 --> 48:42.320
Human beings are really clever

48:42.480 --> 48:45.360
to get everything that can destroy you. It's like,

48:45.520 --> 48:47.880
call a bull, “come and hit me.” It's like that. If there’s

48:48.000 --> 48:50.360
then you’ll like ask a buffalo, “come and hit me.”

48:50.520 --> 48:52.440
Now there's no buffalo, all right,

48:52.600 --> 48:55.960
you ask an elephant, “come and stampede me.” It's like that.

48:56.160 --> 48:58.040
Human beings are so stupid.

48:58.200 --> 48:59.480
So now supposing, I say

48:59.640 --> 49:02.720
if I write down a list of all the thing you drink and smoke,

49:02.880 --> 49:05.160
I don't know how many things there are in this world,

49:05.320 --> 49:07.840
then you'll find out the third thing when I die,

49:08.000 --> 49:12.600
that “Mataji didn't say this one.” So we should do it.

49:12.760 --> 49:18.600
Very intelligent. All the time destroying your central path,

49:19.800 --> 49:22.120
and nicely managing through that.

49:22.280 --> 49:26.480
Is this the way are you going to go to God by any chance?

49:26.640 --> 49:28.560
Is this the way are you following

49:28.720 --> 49:32.720
the great incarnations who came on this earth?

49:34.640 --> 49:38.640
So the balancing comes through Nabhi

49:38.800 --> 49:45.720
and Nabhi looks after you and teaches you how to behave.

49:46.360 --> 49:51.360
For example, now your left Nabhi is Gruha Lakshmi.

49:52.080 --> 49:55.400
Gruha Lakshmi is the Deity of the household.

49:55.560 --> 50:00.040
But if you have too much outward type, you're running a madness.

50:00.200 --> 50:02.760
So early in the morning you get up, read the newspapers.

50:02.920 --> 50:04.720
Is against Sahaja Yoga again.

50:04.880 --> 50:07.280
Not to read newspapers in the morning time.

50:07.440 --> 50:10.200
You can read it in the night,

50:10.520 --> 50:13.960
but not in the morning. Because if you read it in the morning,

50:14.160 --> 50:15.840
you'll get upset.

50:16.120 --> 50:20.840
And poor this spleen has to pour in more red blood corpuscles

50:21.080 --> 50:24.160
and it becomes mad and fails you.

50:24.320 --> 50:26.760
On the contrary, in the morning talk to your wife,

50:26.920 --> 50:29.880
talk to your children, look after your Gruha Lakshmi Tattwa.

50:30.040 --> 50:33.280
The wife also has to be a Gruha Lakshmi as I told you.

50:33.960 --> 50:37.120
Then you have your food properly.

50:37.280 --> 50:39.840
Sit down and eat properly.

50:39.960 --> 50:43.920
But no, just after that, upsetting that Nabhi,

50:44.080 --> 50:45.720
you jump into your car,

50:45.880 --> 50:48.720
taking your breakfast in your hand, eating on the way,

50:48.880 --> 50:53.560
honking at people, getting angry with them,

50:53.720 --> 50:55.840
the wife is calling, “Come along you have your breakfast!”

50:55.960 --> 51:00.080
Nothing doing. You are on your way on a special work,

51:00.240 --> 51:04.240
you end up with leukemia at least, minimum of minimum,

51:04.400 --> 51:07.440
if not with heart attack.

51:08.280 --> 51:14.080
Leukemia comes from left Nabhi, when your Gruha Lakshmi is ruined.

51:16.520 --> 51:19.080
The Deity of Gruha Lakshmi is Fatimabai,

51:19.240 --> 51:22.320
the daughter of Mohammed Sahib,

51:24.160 --> 51:31.160
while the sister

51:32.160 --> 51:39.120
of Nanak Sahib is on the left Vishuddhi. You'll see that.

51:40.520 --> 51:42.920
Nanaki.

51:43.080 --> 51:47.080
Now this aspect of life we never think about.

51:47.240 --> 51:50.520
When you get leukemia, then you'll come to Mother, “please cure me.”

51:50.760 --> 51:54.160
And if you are rich, you will see to it that I cure that person.

51:54.320 --> 51:57.000
If I don't cure you will sit on My head.

51:57.160 --> 51:58.720
You'll be in ten times on My head

51:58.920 --> 52:00.720
unless and until I cure your leukemia.

52:00.880 --> 52:04.480
But if I tell you, “My son, you take it easy,

52:04.640 --> 52:08.080
life is not for getting wretchedness out of you.

52:08.240 --> 52:11.240
What have you gained out of all this running about?

52:11.400 --> 52:14.240
Nothing. But this horrible left Nabhi

52:14.400 --> 52:17.480
by which you are suffering, your family people are suffering.

52:17.640 --> 52:20.200
Only person who has gained is the doctor

52:20.360 --> 52:23.720
or the doctors or the hospitals.”

52:24.960 --> 52:27.240
They won't listen.

52:28.160 --> 52:32.280
And you know leukemia is such a fast developing disease of cancer

52:32.440 --> 52:36.360
that one can pass out within one month,

52:36.360 --> 52:37.600
doctors will tell you,

52:37.800 --> 52:39.960
at the most you'll live for one month, that's all.

52:40.120 --> 52:43.680
They'll take all the money to give this certificate, very nicely.

52:43.880 --> 52:45.600
But why have that?

52:45.760 --> 52:47.960
Be patient with yourself.

52:48.160 --> 52:52.680
Be kind to your Nabhi, look after your Gruha Lakshmi.

52:53.480 --> 52:55.880
All kinds of diseases of the stomach

52:56.040 --> 52:59.800
come from this imbalance this way or that way.

53:00.480 --> 53:03.160
All these great gurus came on this earth

53:03.320 --> 53:06.400
to give us balance, to teach us balance and tell us,

53:06.560 --> 53:11.440
“Don't do this and don't do that.” All the Ten Commandments.

53:11.600 --> 53:16.880
But to us these Ten Commandment have no meaning.

53:19.080 --> 53:22.760
Now I’ll touch a point which is very important today

53:22.920 --> 53:25.080
for you people to understand

53:25.240 --> 53:28.400
about non-vegetarianism and vegetarianism.

53:28.560 --> 53:31.000
Because this subject I wanted to handle,

53:31.160 --> 53:34.040
because if they are vegetarians they can’t bear to see

53:34.200 --> 53:37.880
that Mother says it doesn't matter if you are a non-vegetarian,

53:38.040 --> 53:41.880
because it doesn’t go against your awareness. It does not.

53:42.040 --> 53:43.960
But drinking does.

53:44.160 --> 53:46.960
Drinking does go against your awareness.

53:47.160 --> 53:50.840
But not eating meat or not eating meat.

53:50.960 --> 53:54.120
But one has to understand.

53:54.280 --> 53:57.440
Now somebody told Me that in Gita it is written that

53:57.600 --> 54:04.480
those who eat meat are Tamo Gunis.

54:04.640 --> 54:07.400
I am surprised at Gita itself.

54:07.560 --> 54:11.880
Because Shri Krishna Himself in the very beginning,

54:12.040 --> 54:17.480
has told Arjuna that you should go all out to kill all these people,

54:17.920 --> 54:22.400
even your relations, kill, actually kill human beings.

54:22.560 --> 54:26.600
Your relations and your guru also is to be killed,

54:26.760 --> 54:28.520
because I have already killed.

54:28.680 --> 54:30.920
Nothing is going to be killed by you

54:31.120 --> 54:34.240
because they are already killed.

54:34.600 --> 54:38.640
And He gives so many explanations that it should not be done,

54:38.800 --> 54:42.200
but He said, “No, I tell you, you have to go and kill.

54:42.400 --> 54:44.600
Surrender yourself to Me and I'll take care of them.”

54:44.760 --> 54:48.440
So how did He preach this, I just don’t understand, in Gita.

54:48.600 --> 54:50.760
Now this seems to be a new introduction

54:50.920 --> 54:54.960
that the people who eat (meat) are Tamo Gunis. They are not,

54:55.120 --> 54:58.160
they are never. They are Rajo Gunis.

54:58.320 --> 55:02.440
If you eat meat you become Rajo Gunis not Tamo Gunis.

55:02.600 --> 55:04.960
Tamo Gunis are the people who eat carbohydrates,

55:05.160 --> 55:06.920
we have seen it in Sahaja Yoga.

55:07.080 --> 55:08.880
We have two types of diseases,

55:09.040 --> 55:14.320
one is lethargic organs and one is active organs.

55:15.040 --> 55:22.880
So those who are lethargic having too much carbohydrates

55:23.040 --> 55:28.400
and those who are overactive are having too much proteins in them.

55:28.560 --> 55:32.520
I mean if you take proteins, in the science, scientifically,

55:32.680 --> 55:37.520
will you become lethargic? I mean ask any doctor.

55:37.680 --> 55:39.720
And then the doctor says Gita is all humbug

55:39.880 --> 55:42.960
because it doesn't understand what it is saying.

55:43.120 --> 55:46.680
And while you say like this that “We must follow Gita.”

55:46.840 --> 55:48.960
I think somebody has gone wrong there

55:49.120 --> 55:50.600
and has written something wrong in Gita

55:50.760 --> 55:53.960
as they have written in Bible, they have written in every book.

55:54.160 --> 55:55.560
I'll tell you what they have written wrong in

55:55.720 --> 55:58.480
Bible later on when it comes to Christ.

55:58.640 --> 56:03.040
I think just some people have put it there for oppose.

56:03.200 --> 56:05.800
If you eat too much meat you get Raj Gunis

56:05.960 --> 56:08.720
and Raj Gunis become as I have told you right-sided people,

56:08.880 --> 56:10.440
become very aggressive

56:10.600 --> 56:14.320
and they become ahamkaris and they can harm.

56:14.480 --> 56:17.800
But the people who just eat grass can become

56:17.960 --> 56:20.840
lethargic, absolutely lethargic.

56:20.960 --> 56:23.440
They will have lethargic heart if not active one,

56:23.600 --> 56:25.560
they will also get heart attack.

56:25.720 --> 56:29.240
They will have lethargic intestines by which they will get

56:29.400 --> 56:31.800
tremendous all the time passing out of the stools,

56:31.960 --> 56:33.960
they'll never be able to digest any food,

56:34.120 --> 56:36.120
they'll be very weak people.

56:36.280 --> 56:41.560
So those people who have a lethargic heart or a lethargic

56:44.440 --> 56:51.560
liver or lethargic intestines should take to proteins.

56:51.720 --> 56:53.840
I'm not saying meats, but proteins.

56:53.960 --> 56:56.320
But a vegetarian doesn't take so much proteins.

56:56.480 --> 56:59.360
It's easier to take meat, there's no harm.

56:59.520 --> 57:03.880
But those who are active people should take

57:04.040 --> 57:07.640
more to vegetables. It’s sensible.

57:08.160 --> 57:12.280
Guru Nanaka ate all the meats, was he a bad man?

57:12.440 --> 57:17.920
These Maarwadis who are supposed to be absolutely abstaining

57:18.080 --> 57:21.360
from even from lahasoon (garlic) and pyaj (onion).

57:21.520 --> 57:25.720
Was He worse than them by any chance?

57:25.880 --> 57:27.920
What about Buddha, Himself? He ate meat

57:28.080 --> 57:32.160
because He died of eating raw meat, Himself.

57:32.360 --> 57:34.640
Only thing you should not eat the meat

57:34.800 --> 57:36.640
of animals which are bigger than you,

57:36.800 --> 57:39.680
and not of a cow which is an Indian cow.

57:39.840 --> 57:41.320
Specially Indian cow.

57:41.480 --> 57:43.200
Also bigger cows are not good

57:43.360 --> 57:46.480
because they give you a problem on the teeth.

57:50.280 --> 57:54.960
But smaller animals, even with Jainism

57:55.120 --> 58:03.800
they said that you must save the bullocks, the cows,

58:04.240 --> 58:08.520
and you must save other animals,

58:08.680 --> 58:11.120
but they never said you must save goats

58:11.280 --> 58:13.240
and you must save chickens.

58:13.400 --> 58:18.080
Because Mahavira knew we cannot give Realization to chickens.

58:18.240 --> 58:21.760
What is the use of saving chickens and mosquitoes

58:21.920 --> 58:25.520
and also bugs?

58:26.040 --> 58:28.360
Of course they are doing like that.

58:28.520 --> 58:30.760
Some Jain people save bugs and

58:30.920 --> 58:36.520
put it on a human being, and they take the blood of those

58:37.040 --> 58:39.960
human beings and they are paid for it.

58:40.160 --> 58:41.760
It's absurd but they do it.

58:41.920 --> 58:45.000
For them bugs are more important than human beings.

58:45.160 --> 58:49.640
Billions and billions of bugs cannot make a human being.

58:50.960 --> 58:54.440
All these absurd ideas we have in this country.

58:54.600 --> 58:58.640
So when I say you are not to be a vegetarian

58:58.800 --> 59:01.960
or non-vegetarian, you have to see what you need and eat that.

59:02.120 --> 59:07.320
But all the time your attention is in food itself is wrong.

59:08.320 --> 59:13.040
So there is no good in you people

59:13.200 --> 59:16.960
getting into these problems of vegetarianism and non-vegetarianism.

59:17.160 --> 59:20.160
Of course in the Western countries people should take

59:20.320 --> 59:25.880
to vegetarian food, not absolutely, but more than what they have,

59:26.040 --> 59:29.280
while the people who are in India who are vegetarians

59:29.440 --> 59:31.400
will have to later on take to meat. Otherwise

59:31.560 --> 59:33.240
they will have lethargic heart.

59:33.400 --> 59:35.720
I’ll cure them once again they will have problem,

59:35.880 --> 59:40.360
then they will have to go for a by-pass. Save money there?

59:40.520 --> 59:45.280
You cannot. You will have lethargic intestines,

59:45.440 --> 59:52.040
then you will have lethargic liver. You will have all kinds of

59:52.800 --> 59:56.120
cirrhosis, or maybe on the hand you might get

59:56.280 --> 01:00:02.320
all kinds of rashes and things like that, allergies,

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:07.960
all these problems will come. And then ultimately such people

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:12.120
look so peaceful because you see, they are like cabbages.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:17.360
Yes. If somebody is like a cabbage

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.840
then how do you give him Realization?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.040
You can't give Realization to cabbages can you?

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.120
We have to have here chivalrous people,

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:29.560
brave people, warriors.

01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:33.640
You have to fight the evil forces, and what can

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:39.480
these people who are cabbages going to do for it?

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:49.080
One has to understand yatharth, the reality

01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:54.680
and not put your conception. Because you are born in a Jain family

01:00:54.840 --> 01:01:03.600
and that's why you want everybody to eat grass, is wrong , is wrong.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:09.080
The one who has to eat protein must eat protein.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.960
Now what is the food for Sattvic people?

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.400
That one should eat. You can’t live with it.

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:20.120
So what I eat? Channa.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:24.840
Can you live with channa? Is protein.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:27.600
Channa, or you can eat meat.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:33.120
But not very heavy meats, lean meats and ghee,

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:46.480
and what I eat the most is honey.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:54.320
That's My food. Honey I eat, you know that, honey I drink.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:59.800
That's. But you can't live with that can you?

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:03.120
So you have to eat little carbohydrates. Doesn't matter,

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.120
but you balance yourself in Nabhi Chakra

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:13.680
But there should be no attention on food at all.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:15.280
Actually if you ask Me what I ate

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.960
in the morning, I won't be able to tell you.

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:19.080
Really I'm very bad

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.840
because I have no attention on it.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.360
Whatever one gets, eat it, and you don't feel like eating, don't eat.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:31.520
What's so important is to enjoy every moment of your life.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.920
If a person is finicky about food, specially Indians are,

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.640
is very dangerous for Nabhi Chakra.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:41.280
Because those who are mad after food

01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:44.640
and about Nabhi Chakra

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:48.080
are extremely hot-tempered, I think and...

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.320
I don’t know the word in English is but in

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.560
Hindi we call it chichode,

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:01.960
irritable, irritable, and these chichode

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.160
will make their wives’ lives miserable.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:08.800
They will come and tell, “In that house I ate very good curry nuts.”

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.800
So that poor lady is running after the curry nuts.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.240
We Indians are so much food-minded.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.800
You can't imagine, they won't believe we are supposed to be

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.440
starving people.

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.080
But we are so food-minded

01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:24.440
that once there was for these Bengalis,

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:27.600
supposed to be Mukha Bengalis, I must tell you about them.

01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.680
They had raw fish, raw fish which they get it from the Central India

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:34.800
and people couldn't get fish so they were starving.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.040
So Bombay people very graciously sent one shipload,

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.640
because I know that, I was part of it,

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:45.520
to them as a gracious act that let the Bengalis eat the fish.

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:48.680
They said, “What? We are not going to eat sea fish,

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.200
we are Bangladeshis.”

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.800
Threw all the fishes in the sea.

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:57.080
It all become sardana (rotten) and it was thrown into the sea.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.720
Can you imagine? Nobody will believe in the West,

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:02.000
this is how we are fasting and

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.800
that is how we are poor people.

01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:09.600
Can poor people afford to throw away one shipload of fish

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:14.280
in the sea because they want raw fish?

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:21.240
We are so food-minded that our Nabhis are always like this.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.040
And our women are to be blamed because

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:28.520
they know to control their husbands, they are spoilt them.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:35.360
The job of a woman is to be a Gruha Lakshmi.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:39.040
To have ideals before the family,

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.320
ideals before a husband,

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:43.920
ideals before the children.

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.720
The house should be ideal,

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:49.640
should be a warm house where everybody's welcome.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.040
The wife’s job is to keep her Nabhi all right,

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:56.400
the Nabhi of the children all right and the Nabhi of the husband

01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:00.280
and Nabhi of all the people who come to her house.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:03.360
She has to lead a life of auspiciousness,

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.920
of kindliness, of religious nature.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:11.760
She has to be a soft-natured woman.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:16.560
But this is all missing, only thing she is worried with,

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.480
how to please the husbands.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.560
Because that's one of the big jobs for her.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.720
So to keep our Nabhi all right

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.480
we have to understand as Sahaja Yogis

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:33.440
that we have not to pay so much attention to food.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:38.320
That doesn't mean you eat all dirty food.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:41.520
But it definitely means that when you eat your food,

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:44.600
you must see the vibrations of the food.

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.280
You must always give vibrations to the food.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:50.240
Eat the food which is vibrated.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.440
Certain foods, now supposing if

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:57.240
I have to go and eat in any one of these big five star hotels,

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.920
next moment I vomit, I always vomit.

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:02.600
If somebody invites Me in a hotel,

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:05.960
I start thinking, ‘Baba, now what an ordeal.’

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:09.600
Because it is not cooked with love.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:14.120
That's what it says [Marathi],

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:18.600
“He likes the little berries of Shabari.”

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:25.360
[ Marathi]

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.520
Was does that mean?  That means the love

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:39.200
that is expressed in that food

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.520
is what we should care for,

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:51.600
and not for the lavishness, not for the show of it

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.200
and not at all for your own taste,

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.440
but the taste of food should be

01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:03.240
that it should carry love. Let your tongue feel the love.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.520
That is the best taste,

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:13.760
and whatever is cooked with love always tastes very well.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:20.160
So when you cook, cook with love.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:23.720
When you eat, eat with love.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:28.680
With kind words to the person who has cooked with love

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:33.720
and above all, count your blessings,

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:36.520
count your blessings,

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:43.000
and think of others who may not have had food today.

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:47.160
This is the Lakshmi Tattwa, is where the hand is like this,

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:49.840
where it gives and there's a hand

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.400
where it gives protection to people who need money.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:57.160
But not in a way we do it,

01:07:57.320 --> 01:08:00.560
the way Americans do or Russians do it. We do the way

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.200
Lakshmi does,

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:05.400
that this protection does not get out of hand.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.760
You give it without telling anyone.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:10.280
Just because you have to give you give,

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.280
and actually you do that.

01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:15.960
If you have given, as My father said, one rupee to someone,

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:19.720
run away from that person as soon as possible

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.600
with the speed of one mile, he said.

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.640
But if you have given

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:29.680
five rupees, run away from him at the speed of 500 miles.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:33.360
It's very practical.

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.440
That is how we have to give.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.680
This is the Lakshmi Tattwa,

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:41.160
is the Nabhi Chakra about which I have told you.

01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:44.840
It's a very important Chakra,

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:51.040
because today you are here, because in your Chakra,

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:53.960
Mahalakshmi Tattwa was awakened

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.920
because you wanted to seek God.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.960
Because you wanted to come to God.

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.520
You have not come here for money.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:08.080
You have not come here for anything else but God.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.520
Your seeking is in God.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.960
You want to know the truth about God

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.360
and you want to have God.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:18.040
You don't want to put your ideas on to this,

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.920
but you want to see how Mother wants

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.080
us to receive the blessings of God.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:30.160
So become that as we seek the love of God,

01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:32.720
the grace of God.

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:38.960
The Lakshmi has to be gracious and the Mahalakshmi

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:45.280
is the One who is the gracious lady, is the graciousness in you.

01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:50.280
The grace that must come evolved into your personality.

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:54.280
Within that grace he feels the hankering of the Father.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:59.600
The Father, the Narayana. He wants to have His blessings,

01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:02.200
and that is how the first, the truth,

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.840
the seeking of the truth rises in you,

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:09.120
and that is how the honesty of seeking is blessed

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.480
when the Kundalini rises.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:15.280
She first gives you - first thing that you get

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:20.360
is the truth, by enlightening your brain.

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.840
When I will tell you about Sahasrara

01:10:23.560 --> 01:10:30.560
and about Agnya, I will tell you how this brain becomes

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.920
a receptor of the ultimate truth,

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:39.600
how truth is spread, you start

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:43.280
receiving the knowledge of absolute truth.

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.040
How this brain when enlightened

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:54.920
gives you the power to know what is truth and what is not truth,

01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.680
and there are no alternatives.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.400
This I'll tell you later on

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.960
when the Kundalini I'll describe at the brain level.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:10.960
But for today I think Nabhi Chakra is very important.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:14.080
For all of us, for India specially,

01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:16.080
our Nabhi Chakra is very important,

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.640
that we should know that God Almighty,

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.760
the Narayana, the Vishnu,

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.880
is the One who gives the kshema after Yoga.

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.200
He says, “Yoga Kshema Mahatmyam,” He gives the kshema.

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.960
And we are sinning against the God

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:41.400
when we don't believe that honest and

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.240
righteous and virtuous life will give us the kshema

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.400
as promised by God Almighty.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:51.840
You are sinning against our Father, while in the West

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.320
they are sinning against the Mother

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.360
on the left hand side,

01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:00.880
because they have forgotten that immoral life

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:04.120
is an insult to the Mother Power of God.

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:07.640
So both things are important,

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:11.320
whether in the West or East, is important

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:16.360
that we should not sin against the Father and sin against the Mother.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:21.200
I hope I've tried to tell you everything

01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.720
in such a way that you do not feel hurt.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:26.640
Because all of you come from different, different

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:30.040
types of lives; different, different conceptions;

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:34.840
different, different gurus, and you can get confused about it.

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.040
So, in Sahaja Yoga you should

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.560
allow this to work out.

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.760
Allow the light to come in and don't get confused, don't get upset.

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.360
Here you are to seek God

01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:50.480
and not to sit on what you have known so far,

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:53.840
or which you have heard so far, or whatever you have followed.

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:58.200
Because that has not given you anything whatsoever.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.600
Like one of My disciples who's a big officer

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.960
and one day he told Me, “Mother,

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.880
I don't know about Gita,

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.840
I don't know about Ramana, Krishna, anyone.

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:16.760
I know You, because You are the One who has given me Realization.”

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:22.880
Of course after knowing Me you will know all of them.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:25.280
But it is better you know Me now, because

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:28.360
Those are no more here. It is I Who is sitting here,

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.240
so better know Me first,

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.680
and then you will know Them better

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.200
than what you have known Them before.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.080
So let us compromise in this point:

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:41.480
that try to understand it through Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:45.080
Everything can be proved. Whatever I have said is absolute truth,

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:47.320
nothing but the truth.

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:52.880
But you allow yourself not to be bound by any

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:55.520
previous ideas and previous conceptions.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.880
But let it be open mind to see what I've said,

01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:02.400
it's just a hypothesis, let it become a law.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.960
When you see it yourself, when it becomes in your heart,

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:09.280
on the vibrations, when you see and judge what I've said,

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:17.160
you'll be amazed that Nabhi Chakra which you feel on these fingers,

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.600
even the children can tell you.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:24.160
May God bless you all. Thank you very much.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:30.880
Tomorrow I'll tell you about other chakra called

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:35.080
the Chakra of the Devi, Herself .

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.520
If there are any questions, I've told you, you better write it down.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.320
It's always worked out very well.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:49.760
I think now we should go in for meditation and try

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:52.240
to get your Realization.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:10.080


01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:23.720
Will you please put your hands towards Me,

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.480
like this, just in humble way.

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:33.320
Because you have not known so far, and you will know it

01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:38.440
when you will know it: So you put your hands towards Me like this

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:40.840
and as I've told you these are

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.680
five chakras, sixth and seventh chakra is here is on our hands.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:45.720
Five chakras, sixth and seventh.

01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.280
I must tell you today I met

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:52.440
some Kashmiri Muslims, that's a good idea.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:56.400
Suddenly they did feel for Me something. I don't know how.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.120
And they said, “Are You the Mother?”

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:01.760
I said, “Yes, I am.” They came to Me

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.760
and then said that “You must tell us about Ruh, about Ruh,

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.600
about spiritual life, about Spirit.”

01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:10.680
They came to Me. I said,

01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.440
“All right, you put your hands towards Me like this.”

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:16.200
They put their hands towards Me and they felt the cool breeze.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.360
And they said, “This is what it is. Mohammed has said

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:22.960
that your hands will speak. This is it. That's the truth.”

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:26.040
I said, “Yes,

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.040
when you have your second birth,

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.760
you’ll be rid of all the nonsense of

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:37.560
these so-called religions which are separating you.

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:40.720
They were never meant to be separated,

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:44.480
they were meant to integrate you. But you have done it, doesn't matter.

01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:49.560
Now by God's grace Sahaja Yoga has come, you'll have second birth.

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:52.520
So all the things that are attached to your birth

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:58.960
will be finished and you’ll be a new person having a new life in which

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:03.640
you forget all that is attacking you,

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:06.960
is attached to you, which is dragging you,

01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:11.920
which is making you think, think, think but not ascend.”

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:17.960
I'm very happy, these simple Muslims who met Me, they were in a shop

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:21.960
selling something, and they were so sweet and so beautiful.

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.640
They didn't say that “You are not Mohammed.” Nothing of the kind.

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.640
They said, “This is what Mohammed has said,

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:32.280
that “At the time of the Resurrection, your hands will speak,”

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:37.240
and what are these people fighting for?”

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:44.280
You see. This is what it is.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:47.880
May God bless you all!

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:57.160
Let us have now both the hands towards Me and close your eyes

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.320
just close your eyes.

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.640
[Shri Mataji gives Realization.]
