Shakti Puja, Togliatti (Russia), 3 August 1993.

00:00:09.617 --> 00:00:15.730
Today it is such a great day for our Being,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.145
to be with you all again this year.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:43.701
It’s so very joyous and full of fragrance.

00:00:53.267 --> 00:01:00.853
Today we have decided to have a Puja of Shakti that is the power,

00:01:01.053 --> 00:01:05.201
that is the Devi.

00:01:21.025 --> 00:01:27.575
You know within us there are many powers

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:35.689
of Maha Kali, Maha Saraswati, Maha Lakshmi, Kundalini.

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:54.223
All these powers are there for us to ascent.

00:02:23.115 --> 00:02:32.512
If these powers are properly used and understood,

00:02:32.712 --> 00:02:39.572
then your ascent can be permanent.

00:02:47.743 --> 00:02:51.688
Once you achieve your ascent

00:02:51.888 --> 00:02:55.461
and enter into the kingdom of God,

00:02:55.661 --> 00:03:00.294
all these powers get enlightened.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:15.732
And these powers which are enlightened

00:03:15.932 --> 00:03:24.096
are absolutely filled with Love.

00:03:34.182 --> 00:03:38.722
Enlightenment, we have to understand that

00:03:38.922 --> 00:03:44.086
we get completely enlightened by Love.

00:03:51.406 --> 00:03:55.385
So after enlightenment, after realisation,

00:03:55.585 --> 00:04:01.679
we use only one power which is of Love.

00:04:10.138 --> 00:04:16.872
Shri Rama had two sons: one was Lav and one was Kush.

00:04:21.091 --> 00:04:26.742
One of them, Lav, came to Russia.

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:34.265
That’s why you are called as Slavs, means ‘with love’.

00:04:38.641 --> 00:04:50.241
So Russian people are already quite full of their heart with love.

00:04:55.645 --> 00:05:01.258
But once you get your enlightenment

00:05:01.458 --> 00:05:06.430
you realise that your love becomes

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:13.559
a beautiful ocean of joy for yourself.

00:05:23.795 --> 00:05:31.400
This love is not the same which you had before enlightenment.

00:05:35.246 --> 00:05:46.386
It’s transformed into a new dimension, into a new form.

00:05:48.707 --> 00:05:53.640
Before enlightenment you are attached to yourself,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.765
first of all, very much: to your body, to your mind,

00:05:57.965 --> 00:06:04.077
to your conditionings, to your intellect, to your ego.

00:06:13.621 --> 00:06:16.757
And that is how you develop

00:06:16.957 --> 00:06:24.978
darkness of many horrible things within yourself.

00:06:30.157 --> 00:06:32.513
If you are too much attached to your body,

00:06:32.713 --> 00:06:35.760
then you may eat too much or you may not eat at all

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.899
or you may exercise too much

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:46.913
or you may work it out for a particular form of your figure.

00:06:57.996 --> 00:07:02.632
And you will use your body for absolutely wrong things

00:07:02.832 --> 00:07:07.035
or sinful things also.

00:07:11.638 --> 00:07:15.032
But then you become enlightened

00:07:15.232 --> 00:07:21.301
and you understand that your body is the temple of God.

00:07:27.043 --> 00:07:34.442
Then you keep your body clean and also you try to avoid

00:07:34.642 --> 00:07:39.892
all that is destructive for your body.

00:07:48.255 --> 00:07:53.014
The another attachment we have is very limited,

00:07:53.215 --> 00:07:57.515
say for your own family, for your children, for your wife,

00:07:57.715 --> 00:08:02.361
for your husband, something like that.

00:08:10.736 --> 00:08:15.501
Despite that a human being can be extremely selfish

00:08:15.702 --> 00:08:18.294
and could only bother about himself

00:08:18.494 --> 00:08:23.759
and first of all him and then the rest.

00:08:32.994 --> 00:08:37.563
Also he may spoil his children or spoil her husband

00:08:37.763 --> 00:08:46.914
or his wife in any way just to pamper their ego.

00:08:58.857 --> 00:09:03.891
Some people might indulge into alcoholism

00:09:04.091 --> 00:09:08.340
or drugs or all kinds of things.

00:09:12.622 --> 00:09:21.441
Also to help their families they may draw other people,

00:09:28.392 --> 00:09:34.712
because they are very self-centered and their vision is very narrow.

00:09:38.788 --> 00:09:43.430
Sometimes they discover that for those people for whom

00:09:43.631 --> 00:09:50.818
they are doing wrong things, are not actually bother about them.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:04.218
Then there’s enlightenment and they see for themselves

00:10:04.418 --> 00:10:07.452
that whatever I’m doing is neither good for me

00:10:07.652 --> 00:10:12.200
nor for my family, nor my relations.

00:10:22.127 --> 00:10:27.174
After enlightenment you think collectively.

00:10:29.845 --> 00:10:33.809
Also when you think about your wife and your children,

00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:39.689
your family, you think what is the right thing for them to do.

00:10:48.457 --> 00:10:52.891
Immediately you become attentive to their problems

00:10:53.091 --> 00:10:57.177
and to their destructiveness.

00:11:05.826 --> 00:11:11.802
Then this power of love changes the whole atmosphere.

00:11:14.697 --> 00:11:19.653
In the family people see how sacrificing you are

00:11:19.853 --> 00:11:23.977
and how noble you are.

00:11:31.477 --> 00:11:38.084
This nobility is seen very clearly among Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:42.834 --> 00:11:47.706
In that noble understanding of life

00:11:47.906 --> 00:11:56.669
they try to be extremely patient, sweet in the family

00:11:56.869 --> 00:12:02.220
and try to bring them to the right path.

00:12:12.325 --> 00:12:19.358
At the same time when they are helping their families

00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:25.359
and try to improve their understanding,

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:31.704
they can be also very particular as to see that

00:12:31.928 --> 00:12:41.655
they do not allow over indulgence into their family.

00:12:51.055 --> 00:12:55.391
Because of the enlightenment, there’s detachment.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:04.764
And the power of detached love is the greatest.

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:12.202
It’s like the sap in the trees which rises from the Mother Earth,

00:13:12.402 --> 00:13:17.429
goes up into the smallest of leaves

00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:24.272
and then it is either evaporated or goes back to the Mother Earth.

00:13:34.993 --> 00:13:38.184
It doesn’t stay in one flower

00:13:38.384 --> 00:13:45.770
because it likes it or in one leaf because it likes it.

00:13:52.458 --> 00:13:56.586
It nourishes every part of the tree, whatever is need,

00:13:56.786 --> 00:14:01.107
and is not attached.

00:14:05.969 --> 00:14:12.996
But supposing it gets entangled or involved in one flower

00:14:13.196 --> 00:14:16.684
or in one leaf, the tree will die

00:14:16.884 --> 00:14:21.712
and that leaf and that flower will also die.

00:14:29.673 --> 00:14:37.501
So detached love only gives, doesn’t expect anything back.

00:14:42.157 --> 00:14:47.384
If it expects anything is complete prosperity

00:14:47.584 --> 00:14:54.873
and the goodness of the tree.

00:14:59.818 --> 00:15:04.485
In the same way a saintly person, who is a Sahaja Yogi,

00:15:04.685 --> 00:15:08.384
behaves towards his family, towards his friends,

00:15:08.584 --> 00:15:12.614
towards everything.

00:15:19.663 --> 00:15:25.132
We have used only the power of hatred so far.

00:15:28.241 --> 00:15:31.658
In the politics, especially, one country believes that

00:15:31.858 --> 00:15:36.913
they must hate another country, they are born for that.

00:15:42.606 --> 00:15:44.833
Because hundred years back

00:15:45.034 --> 00:15:48.672
some quarrel took place or a war took place,

00:15:48.872 --> 00:15:53.593
so the children are still fighting among themselves.

00:15:59.749 --> 00:16:03.636
You’ll be amazed that when I first came to Russia,

00:16:03.836 --> 00:16:10.851
25 German Sahaja Yogis rushed to help Me here.

00:16:19.289 --> 00:16:22.905
Instead of bearing that malice in their hearts,

00:16:23.105 --> 00:16:26.655
as their forefathers had killed so many of Russians,

00:16:26.855 --> 00:16:32.613
they felt it was their greatest wishes to go

00:16:32.813 --> 00:16:37.785
and do some service for the Russians.

00:16:49.863 --> 00:16:56.427
So all the hatred changes into this powerful Love.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:08.043
This power of Love is the greatest power and after Sahaja Yoga,

00:17:08.243 --> 00:17:13.422
we have to use only our power of Love.

00:17:18.842 --> 00:17:26.921
It’s the most powerful, effective weapon that we have.

00:17:30.835 --> 00:17:35.116
Because this is Divine Love.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.848
We are getting the source of Divine Love

00:17:40.048 --> 00:17:45.501
from the all pervading power of God’s Love.

00:17:50.906 --> 00:17:54.914
They say that God is Almighty.

00:17:57.369 --> 00:18:01.986
Then who can be more powerful than God?

00:18:04.603 --> 00:18:07.877
And if we are connected with God Almighty,

00:18:08.077 --> 00:18:12.304
who could be mightier than us?

00:18:16.874 --> 00:18:23.511
In His Love He protects us, He gives us whatever we want,

00:18:23.711 --> 00:18:29.752
He blesses us and He makes us enjoy ourselves.

00:18:37.486 --> 00:18:44.751
His government is the most efficient
one and is very quick and very fast.

00:18:48.397 --> 00:18:52.939
Today only when I was coming, one
of the Sahaja Yogis came and said,

00:18:53.139 --> 00:18:57.850
“Mother it is very cloudy, it may rain.”

00:19:04.212 --> 00:19:06.812
And when I came out after five minutes

00:19:07.013 --> 00:19:11.125
I found the whole sky is cleared out.

00:19:14.852 --> 00:19:23.376
So all these five elements also are at
the disposal of the children of God.

00:19:27.821 --> 00:19:31.537
Even the cruellest of the cruel person melts down

00:19:31.737 --> 00:19:40.899
and comes to the humble understanding of this power.

00:19:46.665 --> 00:19:50.815
No one can harm you.

00:19:51.612 --> 00:19:57.104
And anybody who tries to harm you becomes melted away.

00:20:01.761 --> 00:20:05.238
It is so many miracles that in this short speech

00:20:05.446 --> 00:20:07.732
I won’t be able to tell you all of them.

00:20:07.932 --> 00:20:13.099
But you’ll find it in your life itself, how this power of Love,

00:20:13.299 --> 00:20:18.843
that you have within your heart, has protected you.

00:20:28.005 --> 00:20:30.648
I have seen people who are very hot tempered,

00:20:30.848 --> 00:20:35.918
who are angry type, who are all the
time making other’s life miserable,

00:20:36.119 --> 00:20:41.336
become extremely beautiful, nice people.

00:20:51.924 --> 00:20:57.404
With this Light of Love, you love yourself in the right way

00:20:57.604 --> 00:21:03.765
and give up all that is wrong, all that is immoral.

00:21:12.254 --> 00:21:17.022
This Love is eternal, is very powerful

00:21:17.222 --> 00:21:24.846
and gives you a confidence in the collectivity of human beings.

00:21:29.665 --> 00:21:37.813
Because it’s the Spirit which enlightens all your power.

00:21:41.215 --> 00:21:48.895
And the Spirit is the source of collectivity and love

00:21:49.095 --> 00:21:53.189
for every human being in the world.

00:21:58.239 --> 00:22:02.102
Then your attention goes to all the people who are in trouble,

00:22:02.302 --> 00:22:07.953
who are suffering, who need help.

00:22:13.705 --> 00:22:16.833
And with this attention, which is so enlightened,

00:22:17.033 --> 00:22:22.300
you can solve their problems sitting down here.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:33.862
With such people there’s no need to have any wars,

00:22:34.062 --> 00:22:40.696
no need to have any weapons, no need to have any boundaries.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.719
If Russians go to India, they feel India as their country,

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:58.848
if Indians come to Russia they think Russia their own country.

00:23:06.134 --> 00:23:10.151
So who will fight?

00:23:10.351 --> 00:23:14.753
There’s no one to whom you can really say: “He is my enemy” ,

00:23:14.953 --> 00:23:20.552
because everybody is part and parcel of your being.

00:23:29.696 --> 00:23:35.601
These are the special times, I call them the Blossom time

00:23:35.801 --> 00:23:42.239
when too many flowers are there who are seeking the Truth.

00:23:52.484 --> 00:23:57.954
And their fragrance is their Love.

00:24:01.314 --> 00:24:05.536
And they have all to become fruits now.

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:10.624
And this is what is going to happen

00:24:10.825 --> 00:24:15.680
as these times are very, very important.

00:24:20.383 --> 00:24:24.758
In all the religions they are described.

00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:31.021
We don’t hate anyone because we believe in one religion

00:24:31.221 --> 00:24:38.068
or another religion. On the contrary,
we believe in all the religions.

00:24:46.884 --> 00:24:50.723
This is the power by which a drop becomes the ocean

00:24:50.923 --> 00:24:55.197
and individual becomes the collective.

00:25:02.091 --> 00:25:05.591
So all your powers that are there are enlightened

00:25:05.791 --> 00:25:09.924
by the all pervading power.

00:25:15.057 --> 00:25:23.281
It transforms you and it has such a beautiful, delicate way

00:25:23.481 --> 00:25:27.739
of handling everything.

00:25:35.082 --> 00:25:41.526
The only thing that is needed is faith in this power,

00:25:44.566 --> 00:25:49.249
that only by having Love for others,

00:25:49.449 --> 00:25:53.405
and this enlightened Love

00:25:53.605 --> 00:25:59.346
is going to give you whatever you want.

00:26:07.169 --> 00:26:12.075
And there is such a power, All-pervading power.

00:26:18.448 --> 00:26:22.663
There is no doubt about it.

00:26:22.863 --> 00:26:27.118
And we have to just accept it with our open heart

00:26:27.318 --> 00:26:32.982
that it fills it and makes us a great personality.

00:26:39.244 --> 00:26:43.099
So there’s no competition, there’s no ambition,

00:26:43.299 --> 00:26:49.239
there’s no jealousy, nothing of the kind.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:27:00.308
The only desire then left is that "I am enjoying myself,

00:27:00.508 --> 00:27:04.539
let others also enjoy."

00:27:11.118 --> 00:27:16.672
People go out of the way to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:20.211 --> 00:27:26.232
They work very hard, travel with very little money,

00:27:26.432 --> 00:27:29.607
they try to convince people,

00:27:29.807 --> 00:27:35.599
do all kinds of things for no material gain.

00:27:43.497 --> 00:27:46.536
But the greatest joy is when you see that

00:27:46.736 --> 00:27:49.911
you have raised the Kundalini of another person

00:27:50.111 --> 00:27:54.791
and given him self-realisation.

00:28:01.663 --> 00:28:06.852
That lits up your faces I have seen many times.

00:28:12.456 --> 00:28:17.894
Let this Love grow more and more.

00:28:21.142 --> 00:28:26.556
They asked me, why of all places I came to Togliatti.

00:28:30.126 --> 00:28:38.508
Not for Volga, not for these beautiful houses you have

00:28:38.708 --> 00:28:43.289
but for My children who are here.

00:28:50.054 --> 00:28:54.450
May God bless you.
