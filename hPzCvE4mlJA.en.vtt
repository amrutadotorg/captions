00:07.830 --> 00:11.750
If you can put your hands towards me, like this just,

00:13.246 --> 00:17.166
and close your eyes, just close your eyes.

00:25.311 --> 00:30.111
If your hands are shaking or your body is shaking

00:30.111 --> 00:34.231
or your eyes are fluttering, I mean the eyelids,

00:34.271 --> 00:38.191
then you open your eyes and just watch me,

00:38.831 --> 00:41.751
just watch me on my forehead.

00:45.231 --> 00:49.311
Have you been to some guru or someone? No one?

00:49.498 --> 00:53.298
What do you do for your work?

00:54.587 --> 00:56.039
Seeker: I’m a clerk.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.842
Shri Mataji: Ah, that’s it.

00:58.963 --> 01:03.003
Ah, the right side is too much used.

01:04.619 --> 01:06.579
Should work out. Are

01:11.279 --> 01:13.199
Are you shaking also?

01:13.540 --> 01:16.700
No? You are getting cool breeze? It’s great.

01:17.823 --> 01:24.943
Are you getting? Not yet. None of the fingers? Which one?

01:25.271 --> 01:31.150
Did you go to any guru or anyone? Did you to anyone? Guru or anyone?

01:31.271 --> 01:36.231
To spiritualist or anyone? No?

01:42.106 --> 01:46.026
Are you getting cool breeze? Good.

01:48.682 --> 01:54.190
Put both the feet straight. Relax. You are getting? Good.

01:54.311 --> 01:57.311
Close your eyes and enjoy your Self.

02:01.863 --> 02:04.823
Better now. Just do it like that, you see.

02:04.944 --> 02:07.190
It’s more on the right side, is a problem.

02:07.190 --> 02:10.514
It’s because too much thinking, thinking, you know.

02:10.635 --> 02:16.635
So the imbalance of…too much thinking also gives an imbalance, you see.

02:16.756 --> 02:19.389
All the time you’re thinking, thinking, thinking.

02:19.510 --> 02:22.882
That gives you a trouble. It should work out.

02:23.936 --> 02:28.536
See, put your left hand on the stomach, the centre, yes.

02:28.657 --> 02:33.150
Put your right hand now towards me, like this.

02:33.271 --> 02:36.231
Now the shaking will be less.

02:38.311 --> 02:41.311
Put it there so you will be comfortable.

02:41.533 --> 02:43.693
It will reduce gradually.

02:45.271 --> 02:50.231
You See? This is nothing but there’s nervousness inside,

02:50.271 --> 02:51.631
which has to go out.

02:51.752 --> 02:56.718
You see the nerves have been too much tortured by thinking.

02:59.751 --> 03:02.831
Now it’s better, soothing down.

03:04.410 --> 03:06.061
Much better, see?

03:06.182 --> 03:08.182
It will soothe down.

03:08.801 --> 03:12.961
Are you better now? Are you feeling any cool breeze?

03:21.366 --> 03:24.246
How many years you have worked as a clerk?

03:26.911 --> 03:27.951
Clerk: Twelve.

03:31.558 --> 03:36.598
Shri Mataji: Look after his Vishuddhi
and centre heart. He’ll be all right.

03:36.950 --> 03:39.990
Yah! Vishuddhi and centre heart.

03:44.138 --> 03:48.045
Terrific, they are terrific people.

03:49.413 --> 03:52.334
It’s nice you came to see me.

03:53.221 --> 03:57.141
Really, because anything could have happened, you know,

03:57.181 --> 04:01.261
with this kind of a tremendous pressure on your mind.

04:01.883 --> 04:04.963
It’s still there. It will be.

04:08.221 --> 04:11.920
That’s how people get all these troubles, like diabetes, you see.

04:12.041 --> 04:15.961
Then even if they don’t listen to that then they could get heart.

04:16.061 --> 04:19.666
Then you get other problems on the left hand side, you see.

04:19.787 --> 04:22.101
Even paralysis can be due to this.

04:22.141 --> 04:28.140
It’s a very bad thing to work like that, worrying about it. Are you alright?
