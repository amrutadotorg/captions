00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.750
If you can put your hands towards me, like this just,

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:17.166
and close your eyes, just close your eyes.

00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:30.111
If your hands are shaking or your body is shaking

00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:34.231
or your eyes are fluttering, I mean the eyelids,

00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:38.191
then you open your eyes and just watch me,

00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:41.751
just watch me on my forehead.

00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:49.311
Have you been to some guru or someone? No one?

00:00:49.498 --> 00:00:53.298
What do you do for your work?

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.039
Seeker: I’m a clerk.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.842
Shri Mataji: Ah, that’s it.

00:00:58.963 --> 00:01:03.003
Ah, the right side is too much used.

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.579
Should work out. Are

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.199
Are you shaking also?

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.700
No? You are getting cool breeze? It’s great.

00:01:17.823 --> 00:01:24.943
Are you getting? Not yet. None of the fingers? Which one?

00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:31.150
Did you go to any guru or anyone? Did you to anyone? Guru or anyone?

00:01:31.271 --> 00:01:36.231
To spiritualist or anyone? No?

00:01:42.106 --> 00:01:46.026
Are you getting cool breeze? Good.

00:01:48.682 --> 00:01:54.190
Put both the feet straight. Relax. You are getting? Good.

00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:57.311
Close your eyes and enjoy your Self.

00:02:01.863 --> 00:02:04.823
Better now. Just do it like that, you see.

00:02:04.944 --> 00:02:07.190
It’s more on the right side, is a problem.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.514
It’s because too much thinking, thinking, you know.

00:02:10.635 --> 00:02:16.635
So the imbalance of…too much thinking also gives an imbalance, you see.

00:02:16.756 --> 00:02:19.389
All the time you’re thinking, thinking, thinking.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.882
That gives you a trouble. It should work out.

00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:28.536
See, put your left hand on the stomach, the centre, yes.

00:02:28.657 --> 00:02:33.150
Put your right hand now towards me, like this.

00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:36.231
Now the shaking will be less.

00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:41.311
Put it there so you will be comfortable.

00:02:41.533 --> 00:02:43.693
It will reduce gradually.

00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:50.231
You See? This is nothing but there’s nervousness inside,

00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:51.631
which has to go out.

00:02:51.752 --> 00:02:56.718
You see the nerves have been too much tortured by thinking.

00:02:59.751 --> 00:03:02.831
Now it’s better, soothing down.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.061
Much better, see?

00:03:06.182 --> 00:03:08.182
It will soothe down.

00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:12.961
Are you better now? Are you feeling any cool breeze?

00:03:21.366 --> 00:03:24.246
How many years you have worked as a clerk?

00:03:26.911 --> 00:03:27.951
Clerk: Twelve.

00:03:31.558 --> 00:03:36.598
Shri Mataji: Look after his Vishuddhi
and centre heart. He’ll be all right.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.990
Yah! Vishuddhi and centre heart.

00:03:44.138 --> 00:03:48.045
Terrific, they are terrific people.

00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:52.334
It’s nice you came to see me.

00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:57.141
Really, because anything could have happened, you know,

00:03:57.181 --> 00:04:01.261
with this kind of a tremendous pressure on your mind.

00:04:01.883 --> 00:04:04.963
It’s still there. It will be.

00:04:08.221 --> 00:04:11.920
That’s how people get all these troubles, like diabetes, you see.

00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:15.961
Then even if they don’t listen to that then they could get heart.

00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:19.666
Then you get other problems on the left hand side, you see.

00:04:19.787 --> 00:04:22.101
Even paralysis can be due to this.

00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:28.140
It’s a very bad thing to work like that, worrying about it. Are you alright?
