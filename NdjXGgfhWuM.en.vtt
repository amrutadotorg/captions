00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:13.090
Today we are worshipping Adi Shakti.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:22.210
I think this is the most important puja

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:31.410
because it is the power of Adi Shakti

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.490
that has given you Self Realisation,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.370
that has given you the Truth,

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.490
that has given you the power of compassion and love.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:07.570
That's the power that separated from Sadashiva

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:27.810
and this power wanted Herself to create this complete universe.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:38.250
Universes after universes, She's creating and loving.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:46.690
With Her love, She did this great creation,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.210
creation of this world also.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.810
This is a specially selected planet,

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.570
which was very beautifully brought in the centre

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.170
between the sun and the moon

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.530
for the creation of, ultimately, the human beings.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:31.850
This is Her great work with such love and affection

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.810
and with very great hope

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.010
that Her children will know the truth

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.850
and will get the ultimate knowledge about themselves

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.130
and about everything else.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.650
As you have read in the Bible

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.450
about how Adi Shakti came in the form of a snake

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.810
and told human beings

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:23.890
that you have to know the knowledge,

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.250
Adam and Eve, and to Eve specially,

00:03:30.413 --> 00:03:37.090
and they accepted to eat the fruit of knowledge

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.080
because they would have remained just like animals,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.040
without knowing anything subtleties of life —

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.800
little higher animals maybe —

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.320
that once they ate the fruit they started feeling

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.240
that there is something wrong the

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.360
way they are without any clothes,

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.880
so they brought some leaves of the tree

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.480
and covered themselves.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.880
So the first knowledge came was of chastity

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.240
because Shri Ganesha was established

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:40.400
and His influence brought forth this consciousness

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.480
that we have to cover our bodies.

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.040
We are no more animals.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.160
Only the animals

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.000
— of course, they're not standing, so it is all right —

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.160
are not aware of it.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.120
With the knowledge of chastity,

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.440
gradually human beings started growing

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.160
into beautiful nations,

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.440
but there are so many things, which were still to be known,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.840
to be aware of it.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:36.520
You may be aware of many things,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:49.960
but unless and until you get your spiritual awakening,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.600
unless and until you get your self knowledge,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:02.080
all other knowledge is absolutely nothing.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.800
With this self knowledge only, you become powerful.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:19.520
The real power — the real power is of love and compassion.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:31.000
Today when you see the whole world is busy fighting

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.840
and they are trying to protect people

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.760
from wars and creating

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:50.400
great, huge, protecting instruments.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.640
The whole world seems to be in a mad race

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:02.720
of killing each other, of destroying each other,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:11.840
of competition, ambition,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.360
leading to fighting and then to greater wars.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.200
They're fighting for a piece of land.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.520
So ignorant they are.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:36.360
Can you carry even a pinch of this land with you

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:39.160
when you die?

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.400
When you are born you come with closed fists.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.600
When you die you go with open hands.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.760
What do you take with you?

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.720
All right, you may not like to take anything,

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.120
but do you enjoy whatever you think is so great

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.560
for which you are fighting?

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:15.120
Why this fighting going on among all nonsensical people?

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:25.280
It's surprising how people give up their peace,

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.520
give up their understanding

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:34.280
when it comes to a piece of land.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:44.120
And the whole thing has moved into a very wrong direction

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:50.560
and going towards complete destruction.

00:08:51.560 --> 00:09:01.480
The thing that has made human beings so much suffering

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:09.600
because of all their ignorance,

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:16.040
by which they have all those habits,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.880
all those attractions,

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:26.640
all those identification, which is ruinous,

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:34.360
which will ruin all of them, each one by one.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.960
They have to take to sense

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:46.400
and they have to take to their self knowledge.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:55.040
Self knowledge is the key

00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:03.320
for a saviour to give to people.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:09.000
We have had so many saints.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.280
We have had so many Sufis.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:18.000
We had Tao people. We had Zen people.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:24.240
All kinds of realised souls came on this Earth.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:31.200
They all suffered. They were tortured. Nobody understood them.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:40.200
But now the time has come for you to know the truth,

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:47.240
but truth which is not dry, truth which has compassion,

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.400
truth that encompasses everyone,

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:59.760
that brings the complete view of our existence.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:06.400
Why are we here on this Earth? What is our purpose?

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.520
What should we do? Adi Shakti's

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.920
powers are such

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.680
of love and compassion,

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:24.040
that makes you understand your self first.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:31.480
The love, for you, is very, very limited.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:39.160
There's no awareness of your own being.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:44.280
Just imagine what a great task is for you,

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:50.440
how much you have to be seriously

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.280
becoming aware of your self first.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.080
That is extremely important.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:05.360
First you have to be aware of your self.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:11.720
And now you have the light of your spirit.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.640
In the light of that spirit you can see what you are

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.440
and you can see how far you are going,

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:24.240
how wrong things you are doing,

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.760
what harm you are doing to yourself

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.280
and you have a power to cure it,

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:38.640
to improve it and to come to your senses.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.200
These are the most important times.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.520
You will never get these times again.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:53.480
Never had it in the history and you can never get it in the future.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:01.400
This is the time you have got, not only the awareness,

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.640
not only the self knowledge,

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.840
but you know how to do it.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.360
Otherwise, about the saints,

00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.040
about those people, Tao and Zen people,

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.880
they have just described

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:27.800
what a person with self knowledge is,

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:33.000
how he behaves, how his style is,

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.160
how he's so different from others.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:41.360
But none of them have said how you become that.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.000
No one has been able to say that.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.160
Nobody has been able to do that also

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:58.760
because perhaps most of them didn't know about kundalini

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:06.120
and those who knew also could not talk about it to people.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:12.360
So the greatest work of the Adi Shakti is

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:21.800
to put the kundalini in your sacrum bone.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:30.320
This kundalini is not the Adi Shakti.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.040
The Adi Shakti is a much greater thing, a much bigger thing,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.520
much wider thing, much deeper, much stronger,

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.960
much stronger, much more powerful.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:50.800
Kundalini is the reflection of Adi Shakti power

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:58.240
and when She rises you know what happens to you

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:04.480
and how you get your Realisation.

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.440
But you have to be very watchful.

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.440
Are you really a compassionate person?

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:19.000
If you are compassionate,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.680
the first thing that will happen to any compassionate person,

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:29.560
I think, will be to help others,

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.480
to emancipate others.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:38.960
They cannot be satisfied with their own achievements

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:48.160
and with their own state of Self Realisation.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.760
It cannot happen.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:57.240
What was the need for the Adi Shakti to do all, all these efforts

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.080
to work so hard?

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:04.240
You know that, that I had to work very, very hard,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.880
but, from my very childhood

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:11.440
I've worked very hard

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.880
and I've gone through very difficult times,

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:23.920
very, very difficult times according to human understanding,

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:30.080
but the worst time I have, when I see

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.480
those people whom I have given Realisation,

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.600
those who are self-realised people,

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:46.400
they are the ones who have no responsibility for others

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:50.440
and, if they have, it is very little.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.760
They don't have that compassion

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.800
and don't have that love

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.640
that we have to today save the world,

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.040
save the humanity.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:09.440
That's our — not only our principal work,

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.440
but the only work that we have to do.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.960
All other things are going to achieve nothing,

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:25.880
except for your own efforts here,

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.720
individual efforts

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.200
to give Self Realisation to others

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.200
and give them this knowledge.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:42.240
This knowledge is so, so easy to understand.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.880
It is very subtle, no doubt,

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:48.800
and, as I've told you,

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:55.160
that the quantum theory they're talking about now, the scientists,

00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:01.240
is that they have seen those miraculous waves of lights

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.520
and they are trying to find out something about it.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:13.720
It cannot be that some Sahaja Yogis will rise above others.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:21.000
Every one of you [has] to know that this is a very special thing

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.240
that has happened to you.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.960
Even if you had gone to Himalayas,

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.680
even if you have starved yourself,

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:36.160
even if you have been singing the praise of God for years,

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:43.040
even you had done all kinds of rituals and penances,

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.000
you could not have got your Realisation.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:48.600
That would not have been possible.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:55.240
I knew this. That's why I have to work very hard,

00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:01.000
facing all kinds of problems, all kinds of turmoils,

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:06.560
all kinds of pressures, what was the thing?

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:13.560
Just to see that you all are created

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.840
and you're all My hands.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.800
You have to work. Every finger has to work.

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.800
And that is what I have been telling you,

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:33.320
that now it is our responsibility to see that we become,

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:40.480
not only Sahaja Yogis ourself, but blossoming time

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:46.440
and many, many Sahaja Yogis we should have.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:52.720
It's a work of Adi Shakti.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.600
Try to understand this.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.560
It's not work of any saint.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.320
It's not work of any incarnation.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:08.360
It's not work of any politician.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:14.800
And not work of any big leader.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.000
It is the work of Adi Shakti,

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:26.360
which is so transparently showing its results in you.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:32.400
Now it is for you to see.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:40.800
To please Me is your ardent desire, I know.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:50.480
I see how you love Me and how you want to do for Me.

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.560
The greatest thing you can do for Me

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.000
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:07.240
It is a very special, extremely difficult blessings you have got.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.440
You didn't have to do any efforts.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.680
You didn't have to pay any money.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:26.600
You don't have to get sick with rituals.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.800
You got it spontaneously.

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:37.360
But that doesn't mean that it's sort of your birthright to get it.

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.560
[It] is the work of Adi Shakti.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:53.800
And the work of Adi Shakti has to be shown in your life.

00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:03.840
[It] is the compassion, without any reward.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.920
People have tried to spread their religion

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.760
by showing compassion to poor people,

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.880
looking after the poor people, handicapped people.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:24.480
There's no need, actually, for Sahaja Yogis to do that.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:30.800
What they have to do is to transform other people.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:36.240
Find out ways and methods how you can transform,

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:41.200
how you can spread the message of Adi Shakti.

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.840
Put your mind to it

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.520
and you will know how you can manage it.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.080
There should be all the time compelling desire

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.080
that we have to find out method

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:06.040
by which we can spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:13.240
Otherwise it's like what Christ has described

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:20.360
that some seed fell on the marshy land

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:26.840
and they sprouted, but never grew.

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:34.280
You can only grow in the real sense of the word

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:41.200
and become something very, very special and real

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:48.160
by knowing what you can do.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.400
I have a vision, no doubt,

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:56.760
and I've been talking about it quite a lot,

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:03.400
but it ends up with the puja is not a good thing.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.440
I know some countries are very difficult.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:12.680
Try to find out what is the problem,

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:17.800
why it is so very difficult.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:24.040
Attention has to be paid to this,

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:31.800
that what other human beings are doing to destroy themselves,

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.480
as if it is the part and parcel of the same game

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:41.400
which we call as the last judgement,

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.240
but let us, through our compassion and love,

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.360
save as many as possible.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:53.880
This is the work of Adi Shakti,

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:59.280
not the work of any saint or any incarnation.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:02.040
They're all there, no doubt.

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.120
They're all with us, all the time to help us,

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:11.880
but you people have the power of Adi Shakti,

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.720
which is very great,

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:19.680
which is very penetrating,

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.880
which is miraculous.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.320
It's so effective,

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:32.440
but unless and until you become aware of your own powers,

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.600
how will you work it out.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:41.160
It would be like a dead machine that has everything,

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.520
but nobody is there to work it out.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:52.560
All the time I had to go through very,

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:55.640
very hazardous times

00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:02.560
and sometimes I felt that I may have to take another birth,

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.640
the way things are so difficult for Me.

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:13.280
But now, for you, it has been very easy,

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:19.400
as if the one who makes the road has to work very hard,

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.000
but those who walk on that,

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:27.320
they don't realise how easily they have got it.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:33.760
And if they realise this, then they will realise also

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:36.920
'Let many walk on this road,

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.600
which was created with such

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.880
patience, understanding and love.'

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:50.640
I have to really see you all Sahaja Yogis

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:56.280
doing your level best to change this world

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.440
— has to be changed.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.360
As it is, humanity has to be saved

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:06.240
through you and nobody else.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.000
No president, no prime minister,

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.440
no minister,

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.400
none of these people can change the world

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.320
and save it.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.400
It is you who are entitled.

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.000
You have got this power.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:31.960
Do you realise your own status?

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.760
Your own being?

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.480
which has risen so high?

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:46.520
It is not there. If that realisation is there,

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.520
you would go all out

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:57.640
to express your love and compassion to other people,

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:03.040
to make them realise what they are.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.280
Only with Sahaja Yoga you can save this world.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.720
There's no other way out.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:15.600
Whatever you may try, say, to help the poor, to help this and that

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.200
is something very, very superficial.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:28.480
Best thing is to give Realisation to every person you see.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.040
We have seen children. They're coming up.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:38.880
They'll be great Sahaja Yogis also. I can see that.

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:45.120
But before them, you have to show your own merits

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.160
of what you have done.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:51.240
It's not a static work.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:57.800
It's a big movement, which has to be really explosive

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:07.320
and unless and until such a great step is taken,

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:20.320
I don't know who will be blamed for the doomsday.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:27.680
You are the one[s] who have to build up

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.440
the destiny of human beings.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:36.320
Don't consider as yourself, as something nothing.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.960
You could never have got your Realisation.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:41.200
You'd never have come to Me.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.680
Among so many, you are the ones who came to Me

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.960
and who asked for Realisation and got it.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.040
You know it cannot be forced.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.840
This Realisation cannot be forced.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.160
This awareness cannot be forced.

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:07.360
And the growthof this awareness also cannot be forced.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:13.920
You have to develop that attention deep down within yourself.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:18.520
And see for yourself what you have done,

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.840
what you have done.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.240
If you are still busy with the money problem or the power problem

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:31.800
and this problem and that, you are a problem.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.360
You are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:38.560
Sahaja Yogi is above everything else

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.320
and is very powerful.

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:47.040
Power will be achieved by them

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.880
— power of love and compassion,

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:54.280
which is not only words of love.

00:30:54.440 --> 00:31:00.040
It is not only act of loving others,

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:09.400
but it is a powerful personality that you will have,

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:13.000
which will just emit

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:23.480
that great Divine Light and can capture people.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:35.120
All should just take a very brave personality.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.200
I must say people have improved,

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.480
otherwise everybody used to write to Me:

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.800
'This is wrong with me and that is wrong with my father.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.360
That is wrong with my great-grandmother' and all kinds of things.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:57.160
That is over now. Much less, I must say, much less.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:05.000
But instead of telling Me about people who are sick,

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.520
people who have failed,

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:16.480
people who are still in a state

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:23.760
that cannot be improved, attention should be changed.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:30.040
If there's one person who has got cancer anywhere,

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:34.280
immediately at least ten photographs will come to Me.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.880
Leader will write to Me. The wife's leader will write to Me.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:43.960
Everybody will write to Me that Mother, say such-and-such thing.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:52.600
Why? Is that My job?

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:56.960
That person can be cured — we have hospitals —

00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.400
can be cured by photographs,

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:05.720
but attention always goes now to compassion part.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:11.280
To those people who are so-called suffering physically,

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:16.040
mentally, emotionally, financially,

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.120
also in the marriages,

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.120
that's not your job,

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:28.080
neither Mine.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:32.400
If they're sick, they should take a photograph and work it out.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:37.000
If it doesn't work, that means that it doesn't deserve.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:46.840
There is no need for you to treat them and to work it out and,

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.880
if it fails, to write to Me

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.480
that 'Mother, such-and-such person is sick.'

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.520
What's so important?

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:03.360
Already we have so many healthy people going round.

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.720
Why not use them first?

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:10.040
Our job is not to cure people.

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:15.080
Affection is all right. Compassion is all right. Is a natural thing

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:21.960
that our attention goes to sick people or to the poor people

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:26.600
or to the people who are suffering,

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:32.040
but what about Sahaj Yog?

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.680
If you have one sick person,

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.960
hundred Sahaja Yogis will get after that.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.360
What is the reason?

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:50.440
Is it compassion?

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.800
It's not.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:35:01.080
They want to prove that they can cure that person.

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.960
Is not compassion.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.400
Compassion today is

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:14.920
to transform human beings into Sahajis,

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.720
into good people.

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.960
That is the love of Adi Shakti.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.200
Because those who are born have to die in any case.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:31.520
We should not be unkind, of course, but

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:38.000
our attention should be how many people we are giving Realisation.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:41.400
Is a very common thing

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:47.160
that people indulge more into so-called curing

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:52.880
and improving and this. It's all right.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:58.440
Also there are problems like in the marriages, you see.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:01.880
Some marriage couple don't want to be there.

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.480
It's all right. Finish them.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.600
If they don't want to live together, let them.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:15.040
We have many people who are sensible in this world,

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.000
many people who are healthy in this world.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:22.520
Now how can you go on struggling with people

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.560
who don't want to live together and have problems?

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:29.840
That's not your job.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.080
First of all, you are a spiritual worker.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.400
You are not a social worker.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.120
Of course,

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:43.640
by the way, you can do social work. It doesn't matter, by the way.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:51.400
But the main thing for you is to transform human beings.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.840
With that, the greatest disease

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.680
is of meanness, of cruelty,

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:10.800
of torturing others, anger.

00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.480
All these diseases can be cured,

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.680
which are internal, not external.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.400
That is today wanted.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.560
Every country's fighting and is tortured

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:33.880
and is in peril all the time of getting destroyed.

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:40.160
The only way you can do it is to give them Realisation.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:44.920
Now what happens is to be seen very clearly

00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:51.160
that when you give Realisation to someone

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:56.840
and he values it, and he grows into it,

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:01.520
then you are protected.

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.520
You are completely protected.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.880
Who protects you, you may say?

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.960
The Adi Shakti, all right,

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:20.760
but also there is a destructive power working in this world,

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:27.600
not of negativity, but positive destructive power of Shiva.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:39.680
If He says that if Adi Shakti's work is going on well, He's happy.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:43.720
But He's sitting there and watching each and every person,

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:47.560
each and every work of Sahaja Yogis

00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:56.040
and if He finds something really very wrong,

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:59.800
I cannot control it.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:06.560
He destroys. I cannot go to that point.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.360
He destroys.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:18.240
Not only destroys, but thousands He can destroy.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.840
Anywhere there is a calamity,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:33.000
we can say, like an earthquake

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:37.680
or some sort of a hurricane,

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.680
all these things come

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:47.720
through the working of Shri Mahadeva.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.320
I can't help you there,

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:58.160
but if you really give Realisation to people,

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.520
all these can be averted.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:10.480
Of course, it is the whim, I should say, of Adi Shakti

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:15.040
that She started this work of creating this world,

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:20.360
of creating you and making you Sahaja Yogis,

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:24.880
but your responsibility is also very important.

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:31.760
You cannot be responsible.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:44.480
Maybe it was, I felt, My responsibility, but there's a difference.

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.680
I never felt it was My responsibility,

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:55.640
never felt this was My job,

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:58.880
never felt I have to do it.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.520
'I did it.'

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.840
That is the work.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.280
That's the kind of personality you should have.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:17.320
You have to do it in a very humble manner,

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:23.960
in a very beautiful manner

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:29.280
and you'll be amazed to see how you are protected,

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:35.960
how you are supported and how everything works out.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.840
The greatest joy you will get when you will find

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.080
you can give Realisation to people.

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.320
You can change their lives.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.320
Never you would feel such joy,

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:59.440
even if you get, say, a big lottery maybe,

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.880
a big job or a big name

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:10.480
or a very big award, no.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:16.640
The joy of creating Sahaja Yogis

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:22.320
knows no bounds,

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:26.800
is such a joy-giving thing.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:32.880
You develop such fraternities,

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:39.080
such solidarity, as they call it, such oneness,

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:44.320
such enjoyment of love,

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.960
enjoyment of compassion.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:51.920
It's a different level of enjoyment

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:56.160
that's not like ordinary enjoyments.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:01.880
You're not to be afraid of Me,

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:06.280
but be afraid of yourself.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:10.160
Have a watch on yourself and see for yourself

00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:13.880
what have you been doing so far.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:17.280
What have you done so far?

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:23.760
Because you have been enlightened.

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.480
If the enlightened people

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:31.480
cannot give light, what's the use in having them?

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.400
Look at these little, little candles.

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:40.320
Whatever little light they have, they're giving that light.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:44.440
They're burning themselves to give that light.

00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:50.680
If we cannot give that light,

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:56.240
what is the use of enlightenment?

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:02.120
Enlightened doesn't mean the light for yourself only

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:07.160
the light of love, compassion,

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:14.040
which is divine, which is not normal, which is not ordinary,

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.960
as you see in the films.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:22.480
It is a divine love which works

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:28.720
and that is what makes Me sometimes little weak

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.280
when I hear that Sahaja Yogis now

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:37.000
are getting involved in money, in cheating.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:41.720
I mean, all kinds of criminal activities they do.

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:45.640
I can't understand. I can't believe it.

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.760
After getting the highest,

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:55.760
why do you want to go so low as that?

00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:01.600
Because you have not yet felt what you have got.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:07.400
You have not realised what you have got.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.280
And you don't respect yourself.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:20.640
Still, if you are on the same line and the same level,

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:31.520
I must say you have done no justice to Me or to yourself.

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:35.600
We have to work it out.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.240
Single-handed, I've done it,

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:43.000
worked very hard, I must say,

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:50.320
in the sense that I had to deal with horrible people,

00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:59.040
very unkind, very selfish, very cruel.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.760
That doesn't matter.

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:09.200
And such beautiful pearls I have discovered.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:14.520
But you must keep your lustre

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:17.560
and work it out.

00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:24.600
I'll be very happy to know that Sahaja Yoga is spreading

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:29.400
with leaps and bounds, with great speed

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:33.280
and that people are really

00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:41.360
getting into that realm

00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:48.800
of peace, joy and happiness.

00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:51.760
That's My dream

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:55.880
and I hope you all will all work it out.

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.000
Thank you very much.
