WEBVTT

01:25.612 --> 01:29.798
Brothers and Sisters of the World,

01:29.798 --> 01:37.880
It is a great honor for Me to talk about global
problems of women in front of this distinguished assembly.

01:37.880 --> 01:45.105
First of all, I would like to offer My profound
gratitude to the government and people of

01:45.105 --> 01:48.730
our host country, the People’s Republic
of China.

01:48.730 --> 01:54.635
I have had a privilege of visiting China on
two previous occasions, and I am a great admirer

01:54.635 --> 02:00.335
of the wisdom and culture of this great nation
that I have visited.

02:00.335 --> 02:05.865
This is beyond My imagination the most glorious
time in the history of the world, that at

02:05.865 --> 02:10.208
this time we are so much aware of the problems
of women.

02:10.208 --> 02:18.351
Women as a whole have definitely suffered
over the ages, as the previous lady has told

02:18.351 --> 02:26.540
you, because we have not realized what their
importance is and what their proper role is

02:26.540 --> 02:28.185
in human society.

02:28.185 --> 02:34.327
Society itself, which is her creation, tries
to control or put down the womanhood.

02:34.327 --> 02:40.228
In the East, we can say, that due to fundamentalist
influence women have been under great pressure

02:40.228 --> 02:43.782
and their morality is based on fear rather
than freedom.

02:43.782 --> 02:50.875
In the West they have fought for their freedom,
but what they have attained is spurious freedom.

02:50.875 --> 02:56.151
The women in the West have freedom to abandon
all social and moral values.

02:56.160 --> 03:01.473
Thus in the East, we can say, that most of
the women are timid, oppressed and cannot

03:01.473 --> 03:07.623
express themselves, while in the West we find
most of the women are reduced to a sex symbol.

03:08.010 --> 03:10.101
They are keen to expose their bodies.

03:10.101 --> 03:15.994
Their anxiety is to appear in fashion advertisements
and very cheap popularity.

03:15.994 --> 03:21.136
Most of them accepted this position because
otherwise they could not have survived in

03:21.136 --> 03:23.302
that chaotic world of the West.

03:23.302 --> 03:29.171
What most of the women in the East would regard
as very humiliating and degrading is regarded

03:29.171 --> 03:33.243
as something very glorifying in the West.

03:33.573 --> 03:39.351
I have seen both the worlds very deeply and
I feel that unless and until you bring a new

03:39.351 --> 03:46.495
culture by which women from the East and West
can both rise in their own esteem and express

03:46.495 --> 03:52.217
themselves in such a way that they create
high moral standards for their society, women

03:52.217 --> 03:58.201
neither in the East nor in the West will rise
to their full stature of feminine speciality.

03:58.201 --> 04:04.176
The speciality is that if women are respected
for their womanhood, understanding what they

04:04.176 --> 04:10.559
are capable of and how they can empower themselves
with all the education needed, all the security

04:10.559 --> 04:15.162
will be provided to them and they will provide
security to the society.

04:15.162 --> 04:21.424
All the fundamentalists who talk of religion
expect women to be absolutely moral and the

04:21.424 --> 04:22.977
men can do whatever they like.

04:22.977 --> 04:28.560
I feel we have to educate men more than women,

04:28.871 --> 04:35.713
because the idea of war comes also only from the men, in the beginning.

04:36.503 --> 04:42.364
I must admit it is not difficult to collect
money for poor women in the developing countries

04:42.364 --> 04:47.427
and help them to get out of their poverty,
but unfortunately My knowledge is that the

04:47.427 --> 04:55.100
money we are collecting may not reach the
poor women but may end up into the pockets

04:55.100 --> 04:59.030
of the corrupt ministers, bureaucrats and
other people in charge, and ultimately it

04:59.030 --> 05:02.177
will end up in the Swiss Bank.

05:02.177 --> 05:08.044
I do not want to criticize any UN organization
because I know they are very honest in their

05:08.044 --> 05:12.844
purpose, but they must be made aware of what
is happening under the table.

05:12.844 --> 05:20.890
We in India have two very big states
called as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar which are

05:20.890 --> 05:25.283
very much helped by UNICEF as well as the
World Health Organization.

05:25.283 --> 05:30.267
UNICEF started a project called Angan, meaning
“courtyard”, where the children were to

05:30.267 --> 05:32.537
be educated and brought up in a proper shape.

05:32.537 --> 05:39.654
This project is not working at all for the
children, but all the money goes into the

05:39.654 --> 05:44.011
pockets of all the corrupt people who are
in charge of that project and the children

05:44.011 --> 05:49.931
do not even get two percent of what is being
sent for them.

05:51.461 --> 05:58.383
Same with the World Health Organization, which
is sending medicines and equipment to India.

05:58.510 --> 06:03.252
These medicines are sold in the market and
are completely used by the recipients for

06:03.354 --> 06:04.452
their own gains.

06:04.452 --> 06:06.954
The same happens to W.H.O. equipment.

06:06.954 --> 06:11.332
So the poor people never get any benefit and
they remain all the time helpless.

06:11.444 --> 06:16.545
All this money is called dirty money but goes
to the clean Swiss bank.

06:21.046 --> 06:26.895
A large part of the loans which the World
Bank gives to the developing country is also

06:27.007 --> 06:31.724
siphoned back to the personal account of the
corrupt officials maintained in Swiss Bank.

06:32.022 --> 06:36.706
Thus all the developing countries are indebted
to the World Bank but have no money.

06:36.706 --> 06:38.425
The money is in the Swiss Bank.

06:38.539 --> 06:43.990
So I would request you all to take this up
with the Swiss Bank and request them to return

06:43.990 --> 06:50.976
all such money which has been siphoned in
the Swiss Bank [Applause] by very corrupt

06:50.976 --> 06:56.637
people and give this money to the UN so that
the UN can utilize it for the education of

06:56.637 --> 07:05.635
women and other purposes as well as what is
to be given to people under very effective vigilance.

07:05.635 --> 07:12.421
One has to have a very good network of people,
especially women, who are involved and who

07:12.421 --> 07:17.890
are honest, compassionate and who would like
to make the best out of this money, helping

07:17.890 --> 07:21.015
the women who have to achieve social equality.

07:21.015 --> 07:30.193
The main work of womanhood is to create a
good society that would enjoy peace better.

07:30.193 --> 07:36.740
Immorality, corruption and violence are the
two horrible monsters which are eating up our society.

07:36.740 --> 07:41.539
I would blame the mothers of these corrupt
and immoral persons because they failed in

07:41.539 --> 07:43.300
their duty as mothers in their childhood.

07:43.300 --> 07:48.985
The loving training of the mother is the first
and most effective influence in shaping the

07:48.985 --> 07:52.301
children into beautiful citizens.

07:52.780 --> 07:57.748
Mothers who never tried to guide with great
concern and love, or the wives or the daughters

07:57.748 --> 08:02.572
who are falling into the fear of the men or
of the destructive culture, have not done

08:02.572 --> 08:08.294
their duty as integral members of the family
to strengthen the moral fiber of the men.

08:08.294 --> 08:13.452
It is important also to see how children are
treated in these two cultures of East and West.

08:13.452 --> 08:17.558
What we see in the East is that the children
would listen to their mothers if they are

08:17.558 --> 08:20.108
not under fundamentalist culture.

08:20.108 --> 08:26.894
This culture relegates women to the level
of an inferior human being, fit to be dominated

08:26.894 --> 08:28.607
by men and children.

08:28.607 --> 08:30.990
In the West also the same thing happens.

08:30.990 --> 08:34.522
Children don’t respect their mothers, neither
do they listen to them.

08:34.522 --> 08:41.308
I feel this is because, generally, the Western
women spend more time looking after their

08:41.308 --> 08:45.485
bodies and looks than on looking after and
loving their children.

08:45.485 --> 08:50.788
The nexus between the mother and children
weakens and then it is for this reason that

08:50.788 --> 08:54.000
many children become street urchins and violent.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.847
Fortunately there are still many families
in the East and some in the West who deeply

08:58.847 --> 09:04.796
defy the corrupting influence of today and
look after their children and bring them up properly.

09:04.796 --> 09:10.816
But still I must say that the children in
the East are not that much ruined as they are in the West.

09:10.816 --> 09:17.076
The reason, also, is that in the East there
are many people who have not taken to fundamentalist

09:17.076 --> 09:22.067
culture or to the Western culture and have
a very good society and produce children who

09:22.067 --> 09:25.694
are exceptionally good, though this number
may not be very great.

09:25.694 --> 09:31.643
But whatever culture they have inherited,
since long, traditionally, is very much ingrained

09:31.643 --> 09:36.970
in them and to them the moral value system
is the highest, more than money or power.

09:37.975 --> 09:39.807
The West is full of problems.

09:39.807 --> 09:43.937
Though they have money, they don’t have
peace within themselves.

09:45.421 --> 09:51.082
The truth is that women are the potential
power of every civilization and every country.

09:51.082 --> 09:56.839
It is evident that women are the creators
and the preservers of the entire humankind.

09:56.839 --> 10:01.783
This is the role which the almighty God has
given, assigned to them.

10:02.046 --> 10:04.405
Seeds cannot create anything by themselves.

10:04.405 --> 10:09.683
It is the Mother Earth which provides the
flowers and the fruits and other bounties.

10:11.023 --> 10:17.163
Similarly, it is the woman who create the
child, who nurtures the baby and eventually

10:17.163 --> 10:19.163
brings up the citizen of tomorrow.

10:19.163 --> 10:24.274
Women must therefore rank with Mother Earth
as the edifice of the entire humanity.

10:24.274 --> 10:29.505
Unfortunately, men have utilized muscle power
to gain a dominating position over women.

10:29.505 --> 10:39.952
They have not recognized that women are complementary
and equal, but not similar partners in human endeavors.

10:40.311 --> 10:47.121
A society that does not recognize this fundamental
truth and does not give to women their rightful

10:47.121 --> 10:49.121
role is not a civilized society.

10:49.121 --> 10:55.548
In My own country there is a saying in Sanskrit,
“Yatra narya pujyante tatra ramante devata”,

10:55.548 --> 11:02.669
which means that “Where the women are respected
and respectable, there resides the gods of our well-being."

11:02.669 --> 11:10.149
So it is for us, at this moment, to understand
the value of this great power that is given to us by our Creator.

11:10.149 --> 11:11.790
But what do we find?

11:11.790 --> 11:17.618
Whether in the East or in the West, women
have not been able to give a full manifestation of their greatness.

11:17.618 --> 11:24.000
I am not suggesting at all that the only role
of women in human society is that of the mother,

11:24.000 --> 11:28.752
the procreator and preserver of children, or that of a wife, or a sister.

11:28.752 --> 11:35.657
Women have a full right to participate as
equal partners in every aspect of life – social,

11:35.657 --> 11:40.265
cultural, educational, political, economical,
administrative and the rest.

11:40.552 --> 11:46.142
In order to prepare themselves for this all-pervading
role, they must have the right to education

11:46.142 --> 11:47.903
in all branches of knowledge.

11:47.903 --> 11:53.875
But if they are mothers, they have a great
responsibility towards their children as well as their society.

11:53.875 --> 11:59.856
Men are responsible for politics and economics
of the country, but women are responsible for the society.

11:59.856 --> 12:06.212
Women can also support men and they can take
a leading part, of course, in any post, but

12:06.212 --> 12:11.084
it is very important that they should not
forget they are women who have to manifest

12:11.084 --> 12:13.563
deep motherly concern and love.

12:13.563 --> 12:18.195
If they become manly and aggressive, the balance
of the society cannot be maintained.

12:20.851 --> 12:25.579
At the same time I must submit that, while
we ask for the rights of women, we must also

12:25.579 --> 12:29.566
stress the fundamental duties of women to
the human society.

12:29.566 --> 12:38.456
The women in the West, or those who are educated
in the West, also some others I have seen,

12:38.456 --> 12:46.127
have gone to the other extreme when they are
taking to political, economical or administrative roles.

12:46.127 --> 12:53.392
To compete with men they have become much
too self-willed, self-centered and ambitious.

12:53.392 --> 12:59.699
They have no more their soothing, pleasing
qualities which can bring peace and balance.

12:59.699 --> 13:04.714
On the contrary, they become dominating, pleasure-seeking
individuals.

13:04.714 --> 13:10.279
They are far more worried about their physical
attractions than about having a pleasing,

13:10.279 --> 13:12.590
sweet and dignified personality.

13:12.590 --> 13:19.065
They give into their baser self much faster
than men, wittingly or unwittingly.

13:19.065 --> 13:28.182
All this leads to chaotic societies and children
grow up into street urchins, preparing for wars.

13:28.996 --> 13:32.049
What we need is a balance between the two
extremes.

13:32.049 --> 13:37.303
We need women as equal but not similar partners
with men, but with a subtle understanding

13:37.303 --> 13:43.252
of the nature of men and how to bring them
into the center with their inner balance.

13:43.252 --> 13:49.057
We need balanced women in order to have a
balanced human race with peace within itself.

13:49.057 --> 13:54.790
You might say all this is excellent in thought,
but how do we achieve this state of balance?

13:54.790 --> 14:02.010
How do we stem the tide of diseases, corruption,
immorality, immaturity and violence?

14:02.010 --> 14:05.158
How do we end the present state of conflict
and confusion?

14:05.158 --> 14:09.072
How do we bring about peace within every mind
and heart?

14:09.072 --> 14:13.106
I very humbly submit that there is an answer
to these questions.

14:13.106 --> 14:14.795
There is a new way…

14:14.795 --> 14:17.824
Do you want Me to tell the new way?

14:18.374 --> 14:20.374
Moderator: Just tell them.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.528
You have three more minutes.

14:26.347 --> 14:31.889
Whatever I am going to tell you now is not
be taken for granted.

14:31.889 --> 14:38.005
You should, of course, have your minds open
like scientists and treat whatever I am stating as a hypothesis.

14:38.005 --> 14:43.164
If this hypothesis can be proved, then you
have to accept it as honest persons as the

14:43.164 --> 14:46.887
absolute truth because it is for your benevolence.

14:48.275 --> 14:50.274
It is for the benevolence of your family.

14:50.274 --> 14:55.696
It is for the benevolence of your country
and for the benevolence of the whole world.

14:55.696 --> 15:00.711
I am here to tell you about the last breakthrough
of our evolution.

15:00.711 --> 15:07.616
This breakthrough of our evolution in our
awareness has to happen in these modern times

15:07.616 --> 15:14.761
and has been, moreover, recorded in the writings
of many seers.

15:14.761 --> 15:22.121
These are the times called as the “Decadent
Times”, last called by the great saint Vyasa

15:22.121 --> 15:27.830
who has written the Gita, and it is the decadence
of humanity that we see around in every way

15:27.830 --> 15:32.821
possible, and unless and until we improve
that, wars cannot be avoided.

15:32.821 --> 15:36.471
Now I would like to tell the secret knowledge of our inner being

15:36.471 --> 15:38.985
which was known in India thousands of years back.

15:38.985 --> 15:44.168
For our evolution and spiritual ascent there
is a residual power within us which is located

15:44.168 --> 15:46.287
in the triangular bone at the base of our
spine.

15:46.287 --> 15:49.746
This residual power is known as Kundalini.

15:49.746 --> 15:54.857
Though the knowledge of this power was available
thousands of years back in India, the awakening

15:54.857 --> 15:58.604
of the Kundalini was done, traditionally,
on an individual basis only.

15:58.604 --> 16:01.848
One guru would give awakening to one disciple.

16:01.848 --> 16:04.141
As a result of that awakening, what happens

16:04.141 --> 16:07.318
is that you achieve your Self Realization, your Selfhood.

16:07.318 --> 16:12.333
Secondly, when this power is awakened, it
rises and passes through six subtle energy

16:12.333 --> 16:17.205
centers in your body, nourishing them and
integrating them.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.944
Ultimately, this power breaks through the
fontanel bone area called as the Taloo or

16:22.944 --> 16:28.103
the Brahmarandra and connects you to the all-pervading
power of Divine love, which is described in

16:28.103 --> 16:33.429
the Bible also as the cool breeze of the Holy
Ghost also in the Koran as Ruh and also in

16:33.429 --> 16:35.859
the Indian scriptures as Paramchaitanya.

16:35.859 --> 16:38.576
Patanjali has called it as Ritambhara Pragya.

16:38.576 --> 16:43.185
Whatever the name, this is a power which is
all-pervading, which does all the subtle works

16:43.185 --> 16:46.262
of living process, of evolutionary process.

16:46.262 --> 16:51.110
The existence of this all-pervading energy
is not felt before Realization, but after

16:51.110 --> 16:54.000
Self Realization you can feel it on your fingertips

16:54.000 --> 16:58.159
or at the center of your palm or above the fontanel bone area.

16:58.159 --> 17:01.428
Moreover, this process has to be spontaneous,
Sahaja.

17:01.428 --> 17:03.954
Saha means with and ja means born.

17:03.954 --> 17:08.323
That means the right to get this union with
the all-pervading power of Divine love is

17:08.323 --> 17:10.323
the birthright of every human being.

17:10.323 --> 17:12.323
Our mental energies are limited.

17:12.323 --> 17:18.319
Our limited mental energy, which is linear
in movement and has no sustenance of reality,

17:18.319 --> 17:21.252
reaches a point and stops.

17:21.252 --> 17:28.732
From there it boomerangs and all mental, linear
movement comes back to us as a punishment sometimes.

17:28.732 --> 17:34.872
So now we need more energy, higher energy,
deeper energy and for that this happening

17:34.872 --> 17:37.853
has to take place if we don’t want to have
another war.

17:37.853 --> 17:45.620
I must say that in the West, I have met many
people who are true seekers of Truth and are

17:45.620 --> 17:49.175
fed up of artificiality of the Western life.

17:49.175 --> 17:55.124
Also they didn’t know what they were seeking
sometimes and they have made lots of mistakes.

17:55.124 --> 18:00.139
They have gone to false gurus who have taken
lots of money and the people have become bankrupts

18:00.139 --> 18:02.139
and mentally and physically handicapped.

18:02.498 --> 18:10.337
The one thing you must note that the awakening
of the Kundalini and thus achieving Self-Realization

18:10.337 --> 18:14.682
is a living process of evolution for which
we cannot pay anything.

18:14.682 --> 18:17.809
It is like putting a seed in the Mother Earth.

18:17.809 --> 18:21.652
It sprouts because Mother Earth has the power
to sprout it.

18:26.392 --> 18:32.991
Which shows – in the same way we have this
germinating power in the triangular bone which

18:32.991 --> 18:36.484
Greeks called as Sacrum which is a three and
a half coiled energy

18:36.484 --> 18:43.482
which shows that the Greeks knew that this was a sacred bone and hence they gave the same name, Sacrum.

18:43.482 --> 18:49.007
Actually in some people you can see this triangular
bone pulsating and the Kundalini very slowly

18:49.007 --> 18:52.435
rising, but there are many who have got Self
Realization.

18:52.435 --> 18:57.106
Now this Sahaja Yoga is working in 85 nations,

18:57.106 --> 19:01.153
and they have all become extremely peaceful

19:01.153 --> 19:03.280
with each other.

19:03.280 --> 19:10.073
In their hearts, they’re integrated and
they have become extremely loving and compassionate.

19:10.073 --> 19:13.141
I’m sorry I can’t tell you more, but the
time is over.

19:13.141 --> 19:14.514
I hope you don’t mind.

19:14.514 --> 19:19.202
Thank you very much.
