00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:30.310
Dedication through Meditation
Cowley Manor Seminar

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:52.590
Cheltenham, England
31st July 1982

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:29.340
Today, for the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:59.659
first time, I’m venturing to say something
which I should have said much earlier.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:16.440
As today I told you that it is necessary that
you have to recognize Me.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.850
And that recognition is fixed, that condition
is fixed.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.100
I cannot change it.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:43.270
As Christ has already said, that “Anything
against Me will be tolerated, will be forgiven,

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.060
but anything against the Holy Ghost will not
be.’’

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.310
It’s a very big warning ... very big warning.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.760
Perhaps people don’t realize what it means.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.300
Of course none of you are against Me, that
I know, and you don’t do anything against

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.319
Me, that’s very true.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:22.050
After all, you are My children, I love you
very much and you love Me.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:30.030
That’s only the warning that Christ has
given you.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:44.520
But one must think why we are not progressing
so fast as we should have.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:54.989
When people are mesmerized, they fall completely
flat on the ground in front of their gurus,

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:55.989
absolutely.

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:04.450
They give up their money, they give up everything,
homes, houses, families, children, and just

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:15.660
go flat - when they are mesmerized; without
asking any questions, without going into any

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:24.449
detail, without trying to find out the life
of their guru.

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:41.889
All such people also go very fast into darkness,
into greater darkness, and into complete destruction.

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:49.250
But you are Sahaja Yogis and you have to construct
yourself.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.020
I didn’t want to shatter your egos before,
never to tell you in these words.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:01.690
Perhaps this is the first time I am saying
this to you, that you have to dedicate yourself

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:07.659
completely to Me - not to Sahaja Yoga - but
to Me.

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:12.219
Sahaja Yoga is just one of My aspects.

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:18.400
Leaving everything, you have to dedicate.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.400
Complete dedication, otherwise you cannot
ascend any further.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.680
Without questioning, without arguing.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:36.150
Complete dedication is the only way you can
achieve it.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.289
People still get caught up, still get into
problems.

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.770
What’s the reason?

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:53.699
So many people ask Me that, “Once we have
got Realization, how is it Mother we go down?”

00:05:53.699 --> 00:06:00.930
The only reason is the dedication is not complete.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:07.889
Is complete reverence and complete dedication
has been not established.

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:15.990
You still do not know that I am Divine, to
that extent as you should.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.520
I don’t say all of you.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:26.110
But still if you look into your heart and
look into your mind, you’ll find out that

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:35.110
complete devotion that you had for say, Christ,
or for Krishna, or for any one of those who

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.509
have been, is not there.

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:43.889
Krishna said, Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam
sharanam vraja.

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:49.479
“Forget all the religions of the world.”

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:54.569
He didn’t mean the religions like Hindu,
Christian, Muslim, but He was meaning all

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:55.699
the sustenances.

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:03.759
“Forget all the sustenances, and completely
dedicate to Me.”

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:05.779
That was six thousand years back.

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:12.469
And there are many who would still say that
“we have completely dedicated ourselves

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:14.849
to Shri Krishna.”

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:18.590
Where is He now?

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:24.020
Even those whom I have given Realization,
they say like this.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:29.759
Of course, there’s no difference between
Him and Me, but today I am the one, I am the

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:37.009
one who has given you Realization.

00:07:37.009 --> 00:07:53.319
But our first consideration could be our jobs,
our own problems, our family problems, our

00:07:53.319 --> 00:08:03.509
financial problems, and dedication is the
last.

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:08.559
I’m illusive, is true.

00:08:08.559 --> 00:08:09.559
My name is Mahamaya.

00:08:09.559 --> 00:08:12.800
I am illusive, no doubt.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:25.809
But I’m illusive just to judge you.

00:08:25.809 --> 00:08:34.209
Now the dedication is a very important part
of the ascent.

00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:37.500
Why?

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:47.700
Because when you are precariously placed,
when there is immediate danger to your existence;

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:59.640
at this time, when the whole world is standing
at a precarious position where it is going

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:09.033
to be destroyed completely, it’s very important
that you cling on to thing that is going to

00:09:09.033 --> 00:09:18.530
save you with complete might and complete
faith.

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:23.730
Like you are getting drenched in ordinary
water, doesn’t matter.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:30.370
But if you are sinking in the sea, and there’s
a question of this moment of existence and

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:38.720
that moment of destruction - that time, if
a hand comes forward to fetch you out, there’s

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:54.620
no time for you to think anymore but cling
on to it, with all your might, with all your

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.710
faith.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:04.740
When we have baddhas, when we are surrounded
by negativity, we get aware of it, and little

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:07.390
bit we get confused.

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:12.840
And that’s the time we want to cling on.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.780
But the baddhas give you ideas which are detrimental.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:25.810
So big struggle is set in.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:34.660
At that time, what is the best way?

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:39.710
Best way is to forget everything else.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:43.850
Forget that you are possessed, or there’s
baddha or anything.

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:55.650
With all your might, whatever is there, you
have to hold on to Me.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:11:07.760
But our style of dedication is very fashionable
and modern, in which Sahaja Yoga is by the

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.280
way, and Mother is very much by the way.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.870
I’m sorry it’s not going to work out.

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:22.990
I don’t have to tell this to Indians, because
if you read Devi Mahatmayam it’s sufficient.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:30.420
Even if you read Her thousand names, it’s
sufficient, that She can be only achieved

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.420
through bhakti.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.680
She can only be achieved through dedication.

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.860
She’s only fond of Her bhaktas, the devotees.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:45.490
It’s nowhere written that She is fond of
people who can talk better, who can argue

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:52.880
better, who dress better, who live better,
who have better surroundings - but Her devotees.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:12:02.880
And this devotion and dedication should not
be a frenzy or anything, but should be sustained,

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.220
continuous, ever-flowing, ever growing.

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:15.530
That’s the only way, now, for further development.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:29.900
For us, so many small problems are important.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:35.720
Somebody has a house, somebody has a admission
in the college, somebody has some job to be

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:43.240
done.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:51.870
All these considerations are the dharmas which
Shri Krishna has described as Sarva dharmanam

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:54.110
parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:58.780
Give up all the dharmas - all these so called
dharmas.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:05.920
Like a patni dharma is the duty of a wife,
then the pati dharma is duty of a husband,

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:12.630
then the putra dharma is the duty of a son,
the pita dharma duty of a father, and duty

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:18.470
of a citizen, and a duty of a world-citizen.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:34.620
All these dharmas are to be given up, entirely,
and you have to surrender fully from your

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.250
heart.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:43.340
I am what I am, I’ve been that, I’ll be
that.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:49.110
I’m not going to grow any more, or less.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:51.710
This is an eternal Personality.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:14:03.380
It is now for you to get out of Me whatever
is possible, to make the best use of your

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:27.340
birth in these modern times, to grow to your
full maturity, to be able to work out the

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:39.500
complete design that Divine wants to do through
you.

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:51.470
As soon as the dedication starts, you become
dynamic.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.800
Clinging on to that.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:04.990
For this, meditation is the only way, I should
say.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:09.300
Of course, rationally you can do many things.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:14.940
You can rationally accept Me.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:22.740
Emotionally you may feel closer to Me in your
heart.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:29.960
But through meditation, surrender.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:40.550
Meditation is nothing but surrendering, is
complete surrendering - which is a difficult

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:44.540
task for a modern man in the Western countries.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:51.980
He only surrenders to people who mesmerize,
who fully mesmerize them.

00:15:51.980 --> 00:15:56.680
They become slaves of people who mesmerize.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:06.360
But in their own freedom, their ego is more
powerful than their Spirit - in their own

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.360
freedom.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.750
That’s why all the free countries have gone
to dogs.

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:18.050
Because ego plays part, not the Spirit.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:27.610
They cannot master their ego when they are
free.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:34.310
Only if somebody can just entangle their ego
and mesmerize them, then they are all right

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.540
- they are shut, completely they surrender.

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:45.720
And it’s so obvious from the way these false
people have mastered their art of making slaves

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:49.050
out of you.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:17:09.429
In your full freedom, complete freedom, you
have to surrender.

00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:15.309
Freedom does not mean ego, one should understand.

00:17:15.309 --> 00:17:21.669
Freedom is killed by ego.

00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:29.549
Not only killed but is disfigured and disgraced,
is made ugly.

00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:48.919
Freedom, in its subtlest form, means complete
egolessness, no angularities, complete hollowness,

00:17:48.919 --> 00:17:55.049
just like the flute, so that the melody of
God could be played well.

00:17:55.049 --> 00:18:04.049
That’s complete freedom - no “hangs-up”.

00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:22.730
We have to realize that we are in the mire:
mire of ignorance, mire of sin.

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:27.380
Ignorance brings sin.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:37.090
How are we to get out of the mire?

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:41.590
Anybody who tries to pull us out will also
go in the mire.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:51.090
Anybody who wants to come even near the mire,
gets into the mire.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:57.399
He becomes part and parcel of the mire.

00:18:57.399 --> 00:19:04.210
The more we try to take help from others,
we pull him more in the mire and we go more

00:19:04.210 --> 00:19:10.919
down, deep down, into it.

00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:27.369
So the tree of Kundalini has to grow, and
from that tree, Paramatma Himself, the Parabrahma

00:19:27.369 --> 00:19:35.260
itself has to pull you out.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:48.000
It grows out of the mire, and the Parabrahma
has to pull you out, one by one, take you

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:56.419
in the hand and swing you outward.

00:19:56.419 --> 00:20:10.999
But still when you are pulled out, your catch
is not sufficient, you slip down again.

00:20:10.999 --> 00:20:21.330
You come up partly, again you go down.

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:28.720
It’s very enjoyable to be out of it, but
still the feet have not come out fully.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:33.129
Still you are not completely cleansed.

00:20:33.129 --> 00:20:40.940
Unless and until you are cleansed how can
you be completely blessed?

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:52.080
You have to be fully blessed by the Divine,
clothed by the love of God.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:21:00.850
It is surprising to see how the people who
go to these false gurus stick on to him, or

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:10.250
stick on to her, in such tremendous dedication,
that you are amazed - they become just like

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:11.250
cabbages.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:24.509
Till they are completely ruined they just
go on surrendering everything that they have.

00:21:24.509 --> 00:21:37.340
But in Sahaja Yoga, when people come, they
do not surrender, but they are nourished,

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.000
they are looked after.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:47.980
Their health improves, their wealth improves,
their mind improves, their relations improve,

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.059
every way they feel better, their conditions
improve.

00:21:52.059 --> 00:21:57.830
They are all the time getting the benefit.

00:21:57.830 --> 00:22:12.610
We have ashrams which are beautiful, which
are the cheapest, and the food, every advantage

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:20.299
that is available -best possible.

00:22:20.299 --> 00:22:38.039
Everything is there.

00:22:38.039 --> 00:22:49.980
But we don’t realize that all this nourishment
is for what?

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:53.190
All these blessings are for what?

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:55.499
For your higher ascent.

00:22:55.499 --> 00:23:01.179
For getting out of the mire completely.

00:23:01.179 --> 00:23:12.249
Now, you have to adhere, you have to be dedicated,
you have to be devoted.

00:23:12.249 --> 00:23:26.159
We have reservations, we hide things.

00:23:26.159 --> 00:23:39.139
We try to be smart.

00:23:39.139 --> 00:23:52.109
That’s a dangerous situation.

00:23:52.109 --> 00:24:14.129
You all should, within yourself, try to see
what part is so sneaky.

00:24:14.129 --> 00:24:22.070
What conditioning is keeping you out of dedication?

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:28.090
What is making you have reservations?

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:41.570
What fright, which ego, what angle still sticking
out into the mire?

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:52.159
What attachments, what relationships?

00:24:52.159 --> 00:25:01.470
You have to get out of it.

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:09.350
Unless and until you fully get out of it,
it’s not going to work out.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:18.289
There’s no place for half-way things.

00:25:18.289 --> 00:25:23.440
It’s question of now or never.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.480
Christ has said it.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:42.029
He has said it, “You give your devotion
and dedication and leave the rest to Me.’’

00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:51.759
I know who are progressing in dedication and
devotion.

00:25:51.759 --> 00:25:56.769
I have seen people improving so much.

00:25:56.769 --> 00:26:02.489
You need not face Me, you need not see Me.

00:26:02.489 --> 00:26:05.020
In person I need not be there.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.419
It’s all in the all-pervading Power.

00:26:09.419 --> 00:26:21.620
That’s all My light, which knows each and
everything about you.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:29.769
And only through your bhakti, through your
devotion and dedication, you can achieve Me.

00:26:29.769 --> 00:26:39.470
My achievement is the complete manifestation
of your Divine power.

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:48.770
It’s very simple, made so simple.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:27:02.789
I’m only pleased by people who are simple,
innocent, who are not tricky, who are loving,

00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:06.580
affectionate to each other.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:13.879
It’s very easy to please Me.

00:27:13.879 --> 00:27:21.520
When I see you loving each other, talking
good of each other, helping each other, respecting

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:31.609
each other, laughing aloud together, enjoying
together each other’s company, I get My

00:27:31.609 --> 00:27:43.539
first blessing, first joy.

00:27:43.539 --> 00:27:53.150
Try to love each other, in dedication to Me,
because you are all My children, created out

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:58.669
of My love.

00:27:58.669 --> 00:28:04.690
In the womb of My love you all have resided.

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:13.350
From My heart I have given you these blessings.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:23.080
I get disturbed, My hands shake and you fall
back into the mire again, when I see you quarrelling

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.239
among yourselves.

00:28:24.239 --> 00:28:33.220
Jealousies and petty things which belong to
your past life.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:58.109
The help is not so much gross that is felt,
but is a very deeper sense of security, that

00:28:58.109 --> 00:29:05.739
is given to your brothers and sisters.

00:29:05.739 --> 00:29:11.070
A deep love should exist.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:21.630
Selfishness has no place in Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:28.470
Miserliness has no place - has no place.

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:31.710
Miserliness is a sign of a very small mind.

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:35.019
I’m not saying you give Me money, of course.

00:29:35.019 --> 00:29:42.840
But the way we look at money, the way we cling
on to it, the material things, the material

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:47.629
wealth, the material objects, the possessions
you see.

00:29:47.629 --> 00:29:50.389
The greatest possession you have is your Mother.

00:29:50.389 --> 00:30:02.200
Through Her you have your brothers and sisters.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.159
Get out of that past life.

00:30:04.159 --> 00:30:10.289
That past is the mire.

00:30:10.289 --> 00:30:20.580
That should be over now.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:28.960
You are quite aware how, with My power of
Love, I have protected you all.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:36.049
You know how, at every moment, I’ve helped
you.

00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:42.619
At every point of your desire, I have come
forward to fulfill it.

00:30:42.619 --> 00:30:54.909
That’s one side, as I said, the nourishment.

00:30:54.909 --> 00:30:58.850
But now your ascent has to come from you.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:10.669
Your rising has to come from you.

00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:16.340
That has to be worked out by you and you alone.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:23.249
Not by any other Sahaja Yogi or by Me.

00:31:23.249 --> 00:31:28.299
I can only give you suggestions.

00:31:28.299 --> 00:31:32.840
Not only the suggestion, but the warnings.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:35.039
And everything is at hand.

00:31:35.039 --> 00:31:36.039
It’s all worked out so well.

00:31:36.039 --> 00:31:38.389
I’m in Form.

00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:42.080
I’m in Form before you.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:46.299
You don’t have to go anywhere.

00:31:46.299 --> 00:31:51.159
The whole thing is within yourself.

00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:56.960
You don’t have to give money, you don’t
have to give anything.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:03.000
But develop that dedication within yourself.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:19.570
You see, this man who interviewed Me said
that the unemployed are maneuvered by the

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.549
politicians.

00:32:21.549 --> 00:32:29.509
Let God maneuver you.

00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:33.350
But how?

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:39.529
Supposing I have a brush in My hand, I want
to paint something, and the brush I cannot

00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:42.249
maneuver.

00:32:42.249 --> 00:32:52.789
The brush is angular, it’s troublesome,
it’s inconvenient to use that, or, you can

00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:58.970
say it’s uncomfortable, it’s awkward,
it’s clumsy.

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:06.549
How can you use it?

00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:13.109
Dedication is the easiest way to get rid of
all your angularities, all your problems,

00:33:13.109 --> 00:33:20.049
all your baddhas.

00:33:20.049 --> 00:33:29.940
Now watch and see within yourself: are you
dedicated?

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:38.119
Those who are fanatically adhering to Me are
also not correct.

00:33:38.119 --> 00:33:42.499
There should be no fanaticism about it.

00:33:42.499 --> 00:33:49.179
The whole thing becomes a complete logical
thing.

00:33:49.179 --> 00:34:03.580
There is no fanaticism about it.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:20.700
Like, somebody
has to go to a doctor, to see a doctor, then

00:34:20.700 --> 00:34:27.830
fanatic person might say, “Oh, I’m not
going to see the doctor.

00:34:27.830 --> 00:34:35.419
I’m not going, because Mother has told me
that She’s going to look after me.”

00:34:35.419 --> 00:34:42.260
And when she gets sick, she’ll come to Mother
in fright, “Mother You had told me that

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:46.909
You’ll look after me, and how is it I’ve
got sick?”

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:48.900
This is fanaticism.

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:51.440
What is surrendering?

00:34:51.440 --> 00:35:02.570
Deep down you should say, “It’s the Mother,
She’s there, She’s my doctor.

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:09.930
Whether She treats me or not, whether She
cures me or not I’ve nothing to say.

00:35:09.930 --> 00:35:10.930
I only know Her.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:18.910
I don’t know anyone else.”

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:22.850
Is very logical.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:28.900
The logic is, that Mother is the most powerful
thing that you know - logically it’s true.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:34.570
“And if She is so, She’ll cure me.

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:37.630
But if She does not cure me, it’s Her Power,
it’s Her whim.

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:39.870
If She wants to cure me, She’ll cure me.

00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:44.680
If She does not want to cure me, how can I
put my will upon Her?”

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:49.520
Like the dedication of Shri Ganesha.

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:55.490
That when his Mother said, “All right, between
the two brothers, Kartikeya and Him, the one

00:35:55.490 --> 00:36:05.520
who will go round the Mother Earth first will
get the first prize.’’

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:14.850
Now poor Ganesha had a little rat on which
to move, but wisdom He had.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:22.380
And Kartikeya had a very quick-moving peacock
which used to fly.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:32.000
He looked at the peacock and He said, “Who
is greater than My Mother?

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
She’s Adi Shakti.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.260
What is this earth?

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.010
Who has created this earth?

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.660
Is My Mother has created her.

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.510
Who has created this sun?

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.870
The Mother has created it.

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:42.520
Who is greater than My Mother?

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:44.020
No one else.

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.060
Why not go round My Mother only?

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:52.630
What’s the need to go all round the whole
earth?”

00:36:52.630 --> 00:37:01.880
And much before Kartikeya arrived He was sitting
with His present in His hand.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:08.560
His innocence gave Him this wisdom to understand
– that’s what logical is.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:12.089
It’s very logical.

00:37:12.089 --> 00:37:17.560
And also logical it is that “Mother feels
my pain more than I feel.”

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:25.010
What will you say when Christ was crucified
for his Mother?

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:31.480
She was Mahalakshmi Herself, so powerful.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:39.580
She made Her Son sacrifice His life, suffer
like a human being.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:49.860
It was too much, to make Your Son sacrifice,
when You have all the powers in Your hand

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.180
to finish everyone there.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:38:03.300
But was a very delicate job to create this
Agnya Chakra.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:07.270
What does that mean?

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:18.510
Does that mean that He lacked something in
His devotion?

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:30.850
On the contrary, She was so sure of Him, of
His devotion, that She could ask Him to do

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:33.000
that.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.480
So when we expect Mother to do something for
you, there are people who say, “All right,

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.070
Mother I’m giving this thesis.

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:40.380
I must get through.”

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:43.240
All right, give a bandhan, you get a thesis.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.900
“Mother, I’m trying to discover this.’’

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.270
All right, you have it.

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:48.550
“Mother I’m trying to get this job.’’

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:51.310
You have it.

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:59.670
Now, is the other way round.

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:02.390
How many have dedication that of Christ?

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:03.410
None.

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:06.450
It’s a fact.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:11.100
Why is He the eldest brother?

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.330
Because no-one like Him.

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:26.040
He went through all those horrible sufferings,
because He was part and parcel of His Mother.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:30.100
She suffered much more than Him.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:35.930
He also went through that suffering for a
greater goal, for a greater happiness, for

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:37.950
a greater life, for a wholesome life.

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:45.940
That is real dedication.

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:53.140
But the false people can take advantage of
this.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:57.800
When they make the people suffer, they say,
“after all, you have to suffer.”

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:02.530
See how they make it up.

00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:09.270
“You must suffer because after all you must
suffer, otherwise you cannot rise.”

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:19.230
It’s a very subtle understanding, very subtle
it is.

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:25.750
That will make it clear to you that in Sahaja
Yoga first you are nourished, you are brought

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:31.080
up, you are trained, you are made all right.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:37.330
And all the things after that, the sufferings,
are no more sufferings to you because you

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:38.950
have become the Spirit.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:45.960
“Nainam chhidanti shashtrani, nainam dahti
pavkah, nainam kledanti aapoh, nainam shoshati

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:56.540
marutah”: “It cannot be killed by any
instrument, it cannot be thrown away or blown

00:40:56.540 --> 00:41:02.430
away by any wind, it cannot be burnt by any
fire.”

00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:09.490
There’s no way you can destroy this.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:15.920
That is the Spirit that you are.

00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:19.030
So the nourishment has been given now.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:20.900
You have grown up.

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.330
You are nourished.

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:27.740
People when they see Sahaja Yogis, say, “Oh,
they are like flowers.

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:30.080
See their faces, they glow.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.890
How confident, how dignified, how beautiful.”

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:39.420
But for what?

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:45.890
To be the wheels of the chariot of God.

00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:58.230
You have to bear the brunt, and the sacrifices,
which are no more sacrifices to you because

00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:02.160
Spirit gives, it never sacrifices.

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.750
Its quality is to give.

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:08.640
So you don’t sacrifice, you just give.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:20.180
First the mother has the labor pains, all
right, she has all the problems, all right.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:32.060
When the child is grown then he stands by
the mother.

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:37.860
He is the proud son.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:41.430
She is proud of him and he is proud of her.

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:47.300
They stand together, they fight the battle
together.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:59.150
That’s only possible if complete dedication
and preparation for the future life of a Sahaja

00:42:59.150 --> 00:43:01.980
Yogi, you accept.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:14.640
A life which outwardly looks to be a struggle,
a problem, but inwardly is most fulfilling.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:24.710
Once upon a time, when Sahaja Yogis come to
Me, to them even to sit on the ground is too

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:30.670
much of a sacrifice; even to take out shoes
is a big sacrifice.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:35.750
Yesterday, in a program, three people walked
off because they were asked to take out shoes,

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:39.660
as if somebody was making them bald-headed.

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:48.830
They just walked off.

00:43:48.830 --> 00:43:54.110
But why to grow in Sahaja Yoga?

00:43:54.110 --> 00:44:01.800
To grow, to stand up like great children of
a great Mother.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.650
The work is tremendous.

00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:19.190
It’s not for medium, mediocre people to
do this job, frightened, fearful, arrogant,

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:35.020
cheeky - they cannot, they have no mettle.

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:50.270
So, the dedication in meditation, complete
dedication in meditation must be practiced.

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:57.180
It’s not for your good now you are doing,
so-called “your”.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:02.860
First you were a little baby, a small thing;
now you are that collective being, so you

00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:07.200
are not doing anything for yourself, but for
that collective being.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:23.860
You are growing to be aware of that whole
which you are going to become.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:36.630
Your jobs, your money, your wives, your husbands,
your children, your father, mother, relations,

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:43.460
these considerations are over now.

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:49.400
You all have to take up the responsibility
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:56.290
Every one of you is quite capable.

00:45:56.290 --> 00:46:04.000
You are brought up for that.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:13.660
Do whichever way you like, whatever are your
capacities.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:21.760
With full dedication you’ll get it.

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:31.330
Dedication is the thing.

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:38.460
Complete dedication is the only way you can
go further.

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:43.650
There are some Sahaja Yogis, who are half-baked,
we have to drop them.

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:46.000
We can’t help it.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.390
You don’t have sympathies with them.

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:49.390
No good.

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:53.890
If they prove all right we’ll bring them
back again, but you leave that to Me.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:58.160
You don’t put your effort or put your attention
to them.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:02.140
You have to come up.

00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:12.680
You were seekers, then you have found it,
now you have thrived over it, now you are

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:14.220
grown up.

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:15.760
For what?

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.620
Is to stand up.

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:27.110
As I am facing you today, you have to face
the others, you have to face the people.

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:30.730
Dedication doesn’t mean that you don’t
talk of Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:35.660
Many people think that keeping silent is the
way you are dedicated.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:40.170
Only in meditation you should be.

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:45.140
But you have to get out of that shell.

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:54.730
Tell all the nations and tell all the people,
all over, the great message that the time

00:47:54.730 --> 00:48:04.170
of Resurrection is here, now, at this time,
and that you all are capable of doing it.

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:17.770
If somebody tries to sneer at you for that,
with understanding, wisdom, try to say things.

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:25.180
Individual likes and dislikes must be sacrificed.

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:31.830
“I like this” and “I like that” must
be given up.

00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:36.480
It doesn’t mean that you all become like
machines.

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.850
No.

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:43.530
But the enslavement to this “I” must be
given up.

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:47.000
Enslavery to habits must be given up.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.280
You’ll be amazed.

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:55.570
Once you are dedicated, you’ll not eat much.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:59.030
You may not eat at all sometimes.

00:48:59.030 --> 00:49:02.160
You wouldn’t even remember a food.

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.790
You wouldn’t even remember what you have
eaten.

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:13.970
You wouldn’t even remember where you slept,
how you slept.

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:26.110
Is a life that will be like a telescope - expanding.

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:34.620
You will create your own visions and complete
them, fulfill them.

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:44.140
You look so simple, ordinary people, but you
are not.

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:59.210
In dedication, in complete devotion, you have
to do it, now, not for your own gain, for

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:03.650
your own achievement, that’s over now.

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:15.210
Is for completely getting out of the mire
and standing on the land, singing aloud the

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:20.410
praise of your Father.

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:23.970
Those who are in the mire, what music can
they give?

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:26.230
What songs they can sing?

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:31.270
What security can they give?

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:35.400
What help they can render to others?

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:39.380
You have to be out of it, completely.

00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:47.810
Steadfast wisdom is needed for that, steadfast.

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:53.600
Every moment.

00:50:53.600 --> 00:51:06.200
You need not blame your left side and right
side for that, nothing, you just get out of

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.200
it.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.200
Cling on to it.

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:11.930
The Parabrahma has come to look after you.

00:51:11.930 --> 00:51:14.210
Cling on to it.

00:51:14.210 --> 00:51:17.370
Even the death has to go back.

00:51:17.370 --> 00:51:22.270
Then what about these minor things?

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:40.680
Now the name of your Mother is very powerful.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:53.840
You know that is the most powerful Name than
all other names, the most powerful mantra.

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:57.470
But you must know how to take it.

00:51:57.470 --> 00:52:03.870
With that complete dedication you have to
take that Name.

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:07.200
Not like any other name.

00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:13.460
You know that in India when take the name
of Guru, they pull their ears for taking the

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:14.800
name of the Guru.

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:22.160
Means, “While taking the Name if I am making
any mistakes, please forgive me” - means

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.980
that.

00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:30.040
This mantra is a very powerful mantra.

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:43.100
Only what you need is the dedication, the
dynamite of dedication.

00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:54.230
Today I told Rita that all the daisies in
England have fragrance now.

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:55.270
She couldn’t believe it.

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:57.770
She said, “I have never known that.

00:52:57.770 --> 00:53:04.460
On the contrary I always felt that daisies
had no fragrance and they were very funnily-smelling

00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:05.510
flowers.’’

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:12.160
I said, “All right, these daisies you have,
just go and smell them.’’

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:17.310
When she smelt it, she was surprised.

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:21.770
The Name, how subtle it is.

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:26.490
They are the most fragrant flowers of England
today.

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:45.580
Just the Name; which means Nishkalanka, which
means Nirmala, which means completely without

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:46.580
any mala.

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:47.710
What is this, mala?

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:50.870
Is this mire.

00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:55.340
Without any mire.

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:56.830
Nil.

00:53:56.830 --> 00:53:58.330
Absolutely.

00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:03.520
The joy at the Sahasrara is called as Nirananda,
since long.

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:08.480
Since ancient times called Nirananda or Nirmalananda.

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:15.400
So many call it as Nirmalananda or Nirananda.

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:22.700
That joy is the joy that you enjoy even when
you get crucified.

00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:27.650
That joy, you enjoy even when you are poisoned.

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:32.450
Even on your deathbed, you enjoy that joy.

00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:35.830
That joy is Nirananda.

00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:43.540
So be prepared for the second phase.

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:47.220
You are in the front.

00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:54.030
It’s very little time I need.

00:54:54.030 --> 00:55:02.070
But I need really people with steadfast wisdom
and dedication; steadfast.

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:13.780
Even for a second it should not go this side
or that side.

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:23.460
Then, we can progress faster, we can go ahead
to fight the battle.

00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:32.430
Perhaps now you are aware of the subtleties
of the negativities, how they work, how they

00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:42.350
use their power - of course which is limited
- to destroy God’s work, and how you have

00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:47.070
to be alert, equipped, and dedicated.

00:55:47.070 --> 00:56:03.610
This I can only talk to you, I cannot say
to the people who come to Caxton Hall.

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:14.490
Some of them are half-baked, some of them
are absolutely new, naive, and some of them

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:16.200
are absolutely third-raters.

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:31.510
But here, as you are before Me today, I want
to tell you very frankly, as Krishna had told

00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:40.270
only Arjuna, “sarva dharmanam parityajya,
mamekam sharanam vraja”.

00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:45.750
There’s no other way out.

00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:58.120
Vraja means the one who is twice-born, like
a solid, solid personality.

00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:02.840
When you are solid then you must dedicate.

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:07.730
When you are perfected then you must dedicate.

00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:21.150
It will help you to get out of the mire, and
then it will help the great cause.

00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:28.110
No one understands that why Mother is trying
to help us?

00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:32.030
Oh they think She’s too generous.

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:33.110
I’m not.

00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:40.150
I’ve lot of common sense.

00:57:40.150 --> 00:57:55.330
Because you are the ones who are capable of
manifesting God’s joy on this earth.

00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:59.230
You are the flutes which are going to play
the melody of God.

00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:09.560
You are going to be used and maneuvered by
God.

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:18.270
I am doing all this to perfect you, to be
the most beautiful instrument of God.

00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:21.880
To be the right instrument of God.

00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:37.630
I don’t know if you understand how sweet,
beautiful life it would be.

00:58:37.630 --> 00:58:52.110
The life of dedication, with understanding,
logical, completely dedicated, extracting

00:58:52.110 --> 00:59:03.360
all the nourishment, and dedicating it for
a higher purpose.

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:20.350
Something like the leaves extract the sun’s
rays, and give color, achieve color for themselves,

00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:31.440
for a higher purpose, that they can be used
by human beings later on.

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:37.420
Nothing on this earth works out the other
way round.

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:56.740
Everything works out for a purpose; but such
an unselfish, such a wide, such a great, dynamic

00:59:56.740 --> 01:00:00.430
purpose.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:13.840
You become the ocean, you become the moon,
you become the sun, you become the earth,

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:21.070
you become the ether, the firmament, and you
become the Spirit.

01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:26.530
You work for all of them.

01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:35.150
All the stars and universes you become, and
take up their work.

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:42.710
That’s what it is.

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:47.420
Because you have jumped onto your principle,
onto your tattwa.

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:52.390
That’s how you jump onto everybody’s tattwa.

01:00:52.390 --> 01:01:02.410
But be dedicated on that tattwa, because I
am the Principle of all these things.

01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:09.140
I am the tattwa - Tattvamasi, I am the Principle.

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:17.580
Keep to your principle.

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:21.790
I am the Kundalini.

01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:27.460
I am the Essence.

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:35.080
We can only understand dedication of something
which looks bigger in gross ways, which appears

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.420
bigger in a gross way.

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:45.210
But we cannot dedicate ourselves to something
that is so much subtler, which is so much

01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:57.910
minuter, which is so much deeper, which is
so much effective, which is so much dynamic,

01:01:57.910 --> 01:02:01.000
so universal and so eternal.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:10.760
We cannot think of dedicating ourselves to
that.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.700
We can surrender ourselves to somebody who
looks like a mountain, who comes to oppress

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:21.980
us just like a mountain, who is like Hitler,
who is like a false guru.

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:39.790
But to surrender to your subtler being, which
you cannot see with your eyes, which is not

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:50.730
audible, but, in effect, is so powerful.

01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:55.090
Like the atomic bomb, when the atom is split.

01:02:55.090 --> 01:03:02.700
When it is not split, it’s everywhere.

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:15.140
But at the subtlest point it’s so dynamic
that, when you separate it, it becomes such

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:18.240
a dynamic force of destruction.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:34.410
As your attention has now penetrated into
the subtler side of this universe, you get

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:40.369
deeper and deeper into.

01:03:40.369 --> 01:03:57.310
The urge that takes the end of the root to
the source of water, is the same as the source.

01:03:57.310 --> 01:04:09.600
Your Kundalini is the same as the Adi Kundalini
and its Power, the Parabrahma.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:23.240
All these things are to be understood after
Realization and after maturity.

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:25.190
Before that it’s not possible.

01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:30.770
That’s why for last eight years, I didn’t
say these things to you.

01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:41.690
I was always on a very patronizing and a sweet
terms with you.

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:47.810
And always, I made you feel that you are obliging
Me.

01:04:47.810 --> 01:04:56.920
There’s no obligation.

01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:05.790
But beyond all these conceptions, you have
become your Self.

01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:12.250
Now ready to be responsible, to be what you
are made for.

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:25.030
Like the ship is built, is brought to the
sea, tried, and found out to be sea-worthy,

01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:33.640
to sail out now, into the sea.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:42.240
So this is the second phase, where you have
to sail out, when you know everything about

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:47.450
the ship, everything about the sea.

01:05:47.450 --> 01:05:57.970
With complete freedom and wisdom, you have
to sail now, not afraid of any storms, or

01:05:57.970 --> 01:06:07.180
any hails, or any typhoons, because now on
you know, your job is to cross through.

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.910
May God bless you!

01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:10.640
May God bless you!

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.240
Should we meditate for a while?

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:30.810
Can you put off the lights?

01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:52.240
Such vibrations, I tell you.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:07:16.230
If you can form a chain, would be a good idea...

01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:20.110
[SOUNDS OF YOGIS SHIFTING]

01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:24.430
Just see where is Aradhana and Anupama and
also, who's there, Bhavila just look after

01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:25.430
them.

01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:26.430
