00:03.580 --> 00:30.310
Dedication through Meditation
Cowley Manor Seminar

00:30.310 --> 00:52.590
Cheltenham, England
31st July 1982

00:52.590 --> 01:29.340
Today, for the

01:29.340 --> 01:59.659
first time, I’m venturing to say something
which I should have said much earlier.

01:59.659 --> 02:16.440
As today I told you that it is necessary that
you have to recognize Me.

02:16.440 --> 02:21.850
And that recognition is fixed, that condition
is fixed.

02:21.850 --> 02:25.100
I cannot change it.

02:25.100 --> 02:43.270
As Christ has already said, that “Anything
against Me will be tolerated, will be forgiven,

02:43.270 --> 02:48.060
but anything against the Holy Ghost will not
be.’’

02:48.060 --> 02:52.310
It’s a very big warning ... very big warning.

02:52.310 --> 02:59.760
Perhaps people don’t realize what it means.

02:59.760 --> 03:06.300
Of course none of you are against Me, that
I know, and you don’t do anything against

03:06.300 --> 03:10.319
Me, that’s very true.

03:10.319 --> 03:22.050
After all, you are My children, I love you
very much and you love Me.

03:22.050 --> 03:30.030
That’s only the warning that Christ has
given you.

03:30.030 --> 03:44.520
But one must think why we are not progressing
so fast as we should have.

03:44.520 --> 03:54.989
When people are mesmerized, they fall completely
flat on the ground in front of their gurus,

03:54.989 --> 03:55.989
absolutely.

03:55.989 --> 04:04.450
They give up their money, they give up everything,
homes, houses, families, children, and just

04:04.450 --> 04:15.660
go flat - when they are mesmerized; without
asking any questions, without going into any

04:15.660 --> 04:24.449
detail, without trying to find out the life
of their guru.

04:24.449 --> 04:41.889
All such people also go very fast into darkness,
into greater darkness, and into complete destruction.

04:41.889 --> 04:49.250
But you are Sahaja Yogis and you have to construct
yourself.

04:49.250 --> 04:54.020
I didn’t want to shatter your egos before,
never to tell you in these words.

04:54.020 --> 05:01.690
Perhaps this is the first time I am saying
this to you, that you have to dedicate yourself

05:01.690 --> 05:07.659
completely to Me - not to Sahaja Yoga - but
to Me.

05:07.659 --> 05:12.219
Sahaja Yoga is just one of My aspects.

05:12.219 --> 05:18.400
Leaving everything, you have to dedicate.

05:18.400 --> 05:24.400
Complete dedication, otherwise you cannot
ascend any further.

05:24.400 --> 05:28.680
Without questioning, without arguing.

05:28.680 --> 05:36.150
Complete dedication is the only way you can
achieve it.

05:36.150 --> 05:39.289
People still get caught up, still get into
problems.

05:39.289 --> 05:41.770
What’s the reason?

05:41.770 --> 05:53.699
So many people ask Me that, “Once we have
got Realization, how is it Mother we go down?”

05:53.699 --> 06:00.930
The only reason is the dedication is not complete.

06:00.930 --> 06:07.889
Is complete reverence and complete dedication
has been not established.

06:07.889 --> 06:15.990
You still do not know that I am Divine, to
that extent as you should.

06:15.990 --> 06:18.520
I don’t say all of you.

06:18.520 --> 06:26.110
But still if you look into your heart and
look into your mind, you’ll find out that

06:26.110 --> 06:35.110
complete devotion that you had for say, Christ,
or for Krishna, or for any one of those who

06:35.110 --> 06:37.509
have been, is not there.

06:37.509 --> 06:43.889
Krishna said, Sarva dharmanam parityajya mamekam
sharanam vraja.

06:43.889 --> 06:49.479
“Forget all the religions of the world.”

06:49.479 --> 06:54.569
He didn’t mean the religions like Hindu,
Christian, Muslim, but He was meaning all

06:54.569 --> 06:55.699
the sustenances.

06:55.699 --> 07:03.759
“Forget all the sustenances, and completely
dedicate to Me.”

07:03.759 --> 07:05.779
That was six thousand years back.

07:05.779 --> 07:12.469
And there are many who would still say that
“we have completely dedicated ourselves

07:12.469 --> 07:14.849
to Shri Krishna.”

07:14.849 --> 07:18.590
Where is He now?

07:18.590 --> 07:24.020
Even those whom I have given Realization,
they say like this.

07:24.020 --> 07:29.759
Of course, there’s no difference between
Him and Me, but today I am the one, I am the

07:29.759 --> 07:37.009
one who has given you Realization.

07:37.009 --> 07:53.319
But our first consideration could be our jobs,
our own problems, our family problems, our

07:53.319 --> 08:03.509
financial problems, and dedication is the
last.

08:03.509 --> 08:08.559
I’m illusive, is true.

08:08.559 --> 08:09.559
My name is Mahamaya.

08:09.559 --> 08:12.800
I am illusive, no doubt.

08:12.800 --> 08:25.809
But I’m illusive just to judge you.

08:25.809 --> 08:34.209
Now the dedication is a very important part
of the ascent.

08:34.209 --> 08:37.500
Why?

08:37.500 --> 08:47.700
Because when you are precariously placed,
when there is immediate danger to your existence;

08:47.700 --> 08:59.640
at this time, when the whole world is standing
at a precarious position where it is going

08:59.640 --> 09:09.033
to be destroyed completely, it’s very important
that you cling on to thing that is going to

09:09.033 --> 09:18.530
save you with complete might and complete
faith.

09:18.530 --> 09:23.730
Like you are getting drenched in ordinary
water, doesn’t matter.

09:23.730 --> 09:30.370
But if you are sinking in the sea, and there’s
a question of this moment of existence and

09:30.370 --> 09:38.720
that moment of destruction - that time, if
a hand comes forward to fetch you out, there’s

09:38.720 --> 09:54.620
no time for you to think anymore but cling
on to it, with all your might, with all your

09:54.620 --> 09:56.710
faith.

09:56.710 --> 10:04.740
When we have baddhas, when we are surrounded
by negativity, we get aware of it, and little

10:04.740 --> 10:07.390
bit we get confused.

10:07.390 --> 10:12.840
And that’s the time we want to cling on.

10:12.840 --> 10:17.780
But the baddhas give you ideas which are detrimental.

10:17.780 --> 10:25.810
So big struggle is set in.

10:25.810 --> 10:34.660
At that time, what is the best way?

10:34.660 --> 10:39.710
Best way is to forget everything else.

10:39.710 --> 10:43.850
Forget that you are possessed, or there’s
baddha or anything.

10:43.850 --> 10:55.650
With all your might, whatever is there, you
have to hold on to Me.

10:55.650 --> 11:07.760
But our style of dedication is very fashionable
and modern, in which Sahaja Yoga is by the

11:07.760 --> 11:10.280
way, and Mother is very much by the way.

11:10.280 --> 11:15.870
I’m sorry it’s not going to work out.

11:15.870 --> 11:22.990
I don’t have to tell this to Indians, because
if you read Devi Mahatmayam it’s sufficient.

11:22.990 --> 11:30.420
Even if you read Her thousand names, it’s
sufficient, that She can be only achieved

11:30.420 --> 11:31.420
through bhakti.

11:31.420 --> 11:34.680
She can only be achieved through dedication.

11:34.680 --> 11:38.860
She’s only fond of Her bhaktas, the devotees.

11:38.860 --> 11:45.490
It’s nowhere written that She is fond of
people who can talk better, who can argue

11:45.490 --> 11:52.880
better, who dress better, who live better,
who have better surroundings - but Her devotees.

11:52.880 --> 12:02.880
And this devotion and dedication should not
be a frenzy or anything, but should be sustained,

12:02.880 --> 12:07.220
continuous, ever-flowing, ever growing.

12:07.220 --> 12:15.530
That’s the only way, now, for further development.

12:15.530 --> 12:29.900
For us, so many small problems are important.

12:29.900 --> 12:35.720
Somebody has a house, somebody has a admission
in the college, somebody has some job to be

12:35.720 --> 12:43.240
done.

12:43.240 --> 12:51.870
All these considerations are the dharmas which
Shri Krishna has described as Sarva dharmanam

12:51.870 --> 12:54.110
parityajya mamekam sharanam vraja.

12:54.110 --> 12:58.780
Give up all the dharmas - all these so called
dharmas.

12:58.780 --> 13:05.920
Like a patni dharma is the duty of a wife,
then the pati dharma is duty of a husband,

13:05.920 --> 13:12.630
then the putra dharma is the duty of a son,
the pita dharma duty of a father, and duty

13:12.630 --> 13:18.470
of a citizen, and a duty of a world-citizen.

13:18.470 --> 13:34.620
All these dharmas are to be given up, entirely,
and you have to surrender fully from your

13:34.620 --> 13:37.250
heart.

13:37.250 --> 13:43.340
I am what I am, I’ve been that, I’ll be
that.

13:43.340 --> 13:49.110
I’m not going to grow any more, or less.

13:49.110 --> 13:51.710
This is an eternal Personality.

13:51.710 --> 14:03.380
It is now for you to get out of Me whatever
is possible, to make the best use of your

14:03.380 --> 14:27.340
birth in these modern times, to grow to your
full maturity, to be able to work out the

14:27.340 --> 14:39.500
complete design that Divine wants to do through
you.

14:39.500 --> 14:51.470
As soon as the dedication starts, you become
dynamic.

14:51.470 --> 14:54.800
Clinging on to that.

14:54.800 --> 15:04.990
For this, meditation is the only way, I should
say.

15:04.990 --> 15:09.300
Of course, rationally you can do many things.

15:09.300 --> 15:14.940
You can rationally accept Me.

15:14.940 --> 15:22.740
Emotionally you may feel closer to Me in your
heart.

15:22.740 --> 15:29.960
But through meditation, surrender.

15:29.960 --> 15:40.550
Meditation is nothing but surrendering, is
complete surrendering - which is a difficult

15:40.550 --> 15:44.540
task for a modern man in the Western countries.

15:44.540 --> 15:51.980
He only surrenders to people who mesmerize,
who fully mesmerize them.

15:51.980 --> 15:56.680
They become slaves of people who mesmerize.

15:56.680 --> 16:06.360
But in their own freedom, their ego is more
powerful than their Spirit - in their own

16:06.360 --> 16:07.360
freedom.

16:07.360 --> 16:11.750
That’s why all the free countries have gone
to dogs.

16:11.750 --> 16:18.050
Because ego plays part, not the Spirit.

16:18.050 --> 16:27.610
They cannot master their ego when they are
free.

16:27.610 --> 16:34.310
Only if somebody can just entangle their ego
and mesmerize them, then they are all right

16:34.310 --> 16:37.540
- they are shut, completely they surrender.

16:37.540 --> 16:45.720
And it’s so obvious from the way these false
people have mastered their art of making slaves

16:45.720 --> 16:49.050
out of you.

16:49.050 --> 17:09.429
In your full freedom, complete freedom, you
have to surrender.

17:09.429 --> 17:15.309
Freedom does not mean ego, one should understand.

17:15.309 --> 17:21.669
Freedom is killed by ego.

17:21.669 --> 17:29.549
Not only killed but is disfigured and disgraced,
is made ugly.

17:29.549 --> 17:48.919
Freedom, in its subtlest form, means complete
egolessness, no angularities, complete hollowness,

17:48.919 --> 17:55.049
just like the flute, so that the melody of
God could be played well.

17:55.049 --> 18:04.049
That’s complete freedom - no “hangs-up”.

18:04.049 --> 18:22.730
We have to realize that we are in the mire:
mire of ignorance, mire of sin.

18:22.730 --> 18:27.380
Ignorance brings sin.

18:27.380 --> 18:37.090
How are we to get out of the mire?

18:37.090 --> 18:41.590
Anybody who tries to pull us out will also
go in the mire.

18:41.590 --> 18:51.090
Anybody who wants to come even near the mire,
gets into the mire.

18:51.090 --> 18:57.399
He becomes part and parcel of the mire.

18:57.399 --> 19:04.210
The more we try to take help from others,
we pull him more in the mire and we go more

19:04.210 --> 19:10.919
down, deep down, into it.

19:10.919 --> 19:27.369
So the tree of Kundalini has to grow, and
from that tree, Paramatma Himself, the Parabrahma

19:27.369 --> 19:35.260
itself has to pull you out.

19:35.260 --> 19:48.000
It grows out of the mire, and the Parabrahma
has to pull you out, one by one, take you

19:48.000 --> 19:56.419
in the hand and swing you outward.

19:56.419 --> 20:10.999
But still when you are pulled out, your catch
is not sufficient, you slip down again.

20:10.999 --> 20:21.330
You come up partly, again you go down.

20:21.330 --> 20:28.720
It’s very enjoyable to be out of it, but
still the feet have not come out fully.

20:28.720 --> 20:33.129
Still you are not completely cleansed.

20:33.129 --> 20:40.940
Unless and until you are cleansed how can
you be completely blessed?

20:40.940 --> 20:52.080
You have to be fully blessed by the Divine,
clothed by the love of God.

20:52.080 --> 21:00.850
It is surprising to see how the people who
go to these false gurus stick on to him, or

21:00.850 --> 21:10.250
stick on to her, in such tremendous dedication,
that you are amazed - they become just like

21:10.250 --> 21:11.250
cabbages.

21:11.250 --> 21:24.509
Till they are completely ruined they just
go on surrendering everything that they have.

21:24.509 --> 21:37.340
But in Sahaja Yoga, when people come, they
do not surrender, but they are nourished,

21:37.340 --> 21:40.000
they are looked after.

21:40.000 --> 21:47.980
Their health improves, their wealth improves,
their mind improves, their relations improve,

21:47.980 --> 21:52.059
every way they feel better, their conditions
improve.

21:52.059 --> 21:57.830
They are all the time getting the benefit.

21:57.830 --> 22:12.610
We have ashrams which are beautiful, which
are the cheapest, and the food, every advantage

22:12.610 --> 22:20.299
that is available -best possible.

22:20.299 --> 22:38.039
Everything is there.

22:38.039 --> 22:49.980
But we don’t realize that all this nourishment
is for what?

22:49.980 --> 22:53.190
All these blessings are for what?

22:53.190 --> 22:55.499
For your higher ascent.

22:55.499 --> 23:01.179
For getting out of the mire completely.

23:01.179 --> 23:12.249
Now, you have to adhere, you have to be dedicated,
you have to be devoted.

23:12.249 --> 23:26.159
We have reservations, we hide things.

23:26.159 --> 23:39.139
We try to be smart.

23:39.139 --> 23:52.109
That’s a dangerous situation.

23:52.109 --> 24:14.129
You all should, within yourself, try to see
what part is so sneaky.

24:14.129 --> 24:22.070
What conditioning is keeping you out of dedication?

24:22.070 --> 24:28.090
What is making you have reservations?

24:28.090 --> 24:41.570
What fright, which ego, what angle still sticking
out into the mire?

24:41.570 --> 24:52.159
What attachments, what relationships?

24:52.159 --> 25:01.470
You have to get out of it.

25:01.470 --> 25:09.350
Unless and until you fully get out of it,
it’s not going to work out.

25:09.350 --> 25:18.289
There’s no place for half-way things.

25:18.289 --> 25:23.440
It’s question of now or never.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.480
Christ has said it.

25:25.480 --> 25:42.029
He has said it, “You give your devotion
and dedication and leave the rest to Me.’’

25:42.029 --> 25:51.759
I know who are progressing in dedication and
devotion.

25:51.759 --> 25:56.769
I have seen people improving so much.

25:56.769 --> 26:02.489
You need not face Me, you need not see Me.

26:02.489 --> 26:05.020
In person I need not be there.

26:05.020 --> 26:09.419
It’s all in the all-pervading Power.

26:09.419 --> 26:21.620
That’s all My light, which knows each and
everything about you.

26:21.620 --> 26:29.769
And only through your bhakti, through your
devotion and dedication, you can achieve Me.

26:29.769 --> 26:39.470
My achievement is the complete manifestation
of your Divine power.

26:39.470 --> 26:48.770
It’s very simple, made so simple.

26:48.770 --> 27:02.789
I’m only pleased by people who are simple,
innocent, who are not tricky, who are loving,

27:02.789 --> 27:06.580
affectionate to each other.

27:06.580 --> 27:13.879
It’s very easy to please Me.

27:13.879 --> 27:21.520
When I see you loving each other, talking
good of each other, helping each other, respecting

27:21.520 --> 27:31.609
each other, laughing aloud together, enjoying
together each other’s company, I get My

27:31.609 --> 27:43.539
first blessing, first joy.

27:43.539 --> 27:53.150
Try to love each other, in dedication to Me,
because you are all My children, created out

27:53.150 --> 27:58.669
of My love.

27:58.669 --> 28:04.690
In the womb of My love you all have resided.

28:04.690 --> 28:13.350
From My heart I have given you these blessings.

28:13.350 --> 28:23.080
I get disturbed, My hands shake and you fall
back into the mire again, when I see you quarrelling

28:23.080 --> 28:24.239
among yourselves.

28:24.239 --> 28:33.220
Jealousies and petty things which belong to
your past life.

28:33.220 --> 28:58.109
The help is not so much gross that is felt,
but is a very deeper sense of security, that

28:58.109 --> 29:05.739
is given to your brothers and sisters.

29:05.739 --> 29:11.070
A deep love should exist.

29:11.070 --> 29:21.630
Selfishness has no place in Sahaja Yoga.

29:21.630 --> 29:28.470
Miserliness has no place - has no place.

29:28.470 --> 29:31.710
Miserliness is a sign of a very small mind.

29:31.710 --> 29:35.019
I’m not saying you give Me money, of course.

29:35.019 --> 29:42.840
But the way we look at money, the way we cling
on to it, the material things, the material

29:42.840 --> 29:47.629
wealth, the material objects, the possessions
you see.

29:47.629 --> 29:50.389
The greatest possession you have is your Mother.

29:50.389 --> 30:02.200
Through Her you have your brothers and sisters.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.159
Get out of that past life.

30:04.159 --> 30:10.289
That past is the mire.

30:10.289 --> 30:20.580
That should be over now.

30:20.580 --> 30:28.960
You are quite aware how, with My power of
Love, I have protected you all.

30:28.960 --> 30:36.049
You know how, at every moment, I’ve helped
you.

30:36.049 --> 30:42.619
At every point of your desire, I have come
forward to fulfill it.

30:42.619 --> 30:54.909
That’s one side, as I said, the nourishment.

30:54.909 --> 30:58.850
But now your ascent has to come from you.

30:58.850 --> 31:10.669
Your rising has to come from you.

31:10.669 --> 31:16.340
That has to be worked out by you and you alone.

31:16.340 --> 31:23.249
Not by any other Sahaja Yogi or by Me.

31:23.249 --> 31:28.299
I can only give you suggestions.

31:28.299 --> 31:32.840
Not only the suggestion, but the warnings.

31:32.840 --> 31:35.039
And everything is at hand.

31:35.039 --> 31:36.039
It’s all worked out so well.

31:36.039 --> 31:38.389
I’m in Form.

31:38.389 --> 31:42.080
I’m in Form before you.

31:42.080 --> 31:46.299
You don’t have to go anywhere.

31:46.299 --> 31:51.159
The whole thing is within yourself.

31:51.159 --> 31:56.960
You don’t have to give money, you don’t
have to give anything.

31:56.960 --> 32:03.000
But develop that dedication within yourself.

32:03.000 --> 32:19.570
You see, this man who interviewed Me said
that the unemployed are maneuvered by the

32:19.570 --> 32:21.549
politicians.

32:21.549 --> 32:29.509
Let God maneuver you.

32:29.509 --> 32:33.350
But how?

32:33.350 --> 32:39.529
Supposing I have a brush in My hand, I want
to paint something, and the brush I cannot

32:39.529 --> 32:42.249
maneuver.

32:42.249 --> 32:52.789
The brush is angular, it’s troublesome,
it’s inconvenient to use that, or, you can

32:52.789 --> 32:58.970
say it’s uncomfortable, it’s awkward,
it’s clumsy.

32:58.970 --> 33:06.549
How can you use it?

33:06.549 --> 33:13.109
Dedication is the easiest way to get rid of
all your angularities, all your problems,

33:13.109 --> 33:20.049
all your baddhas.

33:20.049 --> 33:29.940
Now watch and see within yourself: are you
dedicated?

33:29.940 --> 33:38.119
Those who are fanatically adhering to Me are
also not correct.

33:38.119 --> 33:42.499
There should be no fanaticism about it.

33:42.499 --> 33:49.179
The whole thing becomes a complete logical
thing.

33:49.179 --> 34:03.580
There is no fanaticism about it.

34:03.580 --> 34:20.700
Like, somebody
has to go to a doctor, to see a doctor, then

34:20.700 --> 34:27.830
fanatic person might say, “Oh, I’m not
going to see the doctor.

34:27.830 --> 34:35.419
I’m not going, because Mother has told me
that She’s going to look after me.”

34:35.419 --> 34:42.260
And when she gets sick, she’ll come to Mother
in fright, “Mother You had told me that

34:42.260 --> 34:46.909
You’ll look after me, and how is it I’ve
got sick?”

34:46.909 --> 34:48.900
This is fanaticism.

34:48.900 --> 34:51.440
What is surrendering?

34:51.440 --> 35:02.570
Deep down you should say, “It’s the Mother,
She’s there, She’s my doctor.

35:02.570 --> 35:09.930
Whether She treats me or not, whether She
cures me or not I’ve nothing to say.

35:09.930 --> 35:10.930
I only know Her.

35:10.930 --> 35:18.910
I don’t know anyone else.”

35:18.910 --> 35:22.850
Is very logical.

35:22.850 --> 35:28.900
The logic is, that Mother is the most powerful
thing that you know - logically it’s true.

35:28.900 --> 35:34.570
“And if She is so, She’ll cure me.

35:34.570 --> 35:37.630
But if She does not cure me, it’s Her Power,
it’s Her whim.

35:37.630 --> 35:39.870
If She wants to cure me, She’ll cure me.

35:39.870 --> 35:44.680
If She does not want to cure me, how can I
put my will upon Her?”

35:44.680 --> 35:49.520
Like the dedication of Shri Ganesha.

35:49.520 --> 35:55.490
That when his Mother said, “All right, between
the two brothers, Kartikeya and Him, the one

35:55.490 --> 36:05.520
who will go round the Mother Earth first will
get the first prize.’’

36:05.520 --> 36:14.850
Now poor Ganesha had a little rat on which
to move, but wisdom He had.

36:14.850 --> 36:22.380
And Kartikeya had a very quick-moving peacock
which used to fly.

36:22.380 --> 36:32.000
He looked at the peacock and He said, “Who
is greater than My Mother?

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
She’s Adi Shakti.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.260
What is this earth?

36:34.260 --> 36:36.010
Who has created this earth?

36:36.010 --> 36:37.660
Is My Mother has created her.

36:37.660 --> 36:39.510
Who has created this sun?

36:39.510 --> 36:40.870
The Mother has created it.

36:40.870 --> 36:42.520
Who is greater than My Mother?

36:42.520 --> 36:44.020
No one else.

36:44.020 --> 36:47.060
Why not go round My Mother only?

36:47.060 --> 36:52.630
What’s the need to go all round the whole
earth?”

36:52.630 --> 37:01.880
And much before Kartikeya arrived He was sitting
with His present in His hand.

37:01.880 --> 37:08.560
His innocence gave Him this wisdom to understand
– that’s what logical is.

37:08.560 --> 37:12.089
It’s very logical.

37:12.089 --> 37:17.560
And also logical it is that “Mother feels
my pain more than I feel.”

37:17.560 --> 37:25.010
What will you say when Christ was crucified
for his Mother?

37:25.010 --> 37:31.480
She was Mahalakshmi Herself, so powerful.

37:31.480 --> 37:39.580
She made Her Son sacrifice His life, suffer
like a human being.

37:39.580 --> 37:49.860
It was too much, to make Your Son sacrifice,
when You have all the powers in Your hand

37:49.860 --> 37:51.180
to finish everyone there.

37:51.180 --> 38:03.300
But was a very delicate job to create this
Agnya Chakra.

38:03.300 --> 38:07.270
What does that mean?

38:07.270 --> 38:18.510
Does that mean that He lacked something in
His devotion?

38:18.510 --> 38:30.850
On the contrary, She was so sure of Him, of
His devotion, that She could ask Him to do

38:30.850 --> 38:33.000
that.

38:33.000 --> 38:37.480
So when we expect Mother to do something for
you, there are people who say, “All right,

38:37.480 --> 38:39.070
Mother I’m giving this thesis.

38:39.070 --> 38:40.380
I must get through.”

38:40.380 --> 38:43.240
All right, give a bandhan, you get a thesis.

38:43.240 --> 38:44.900
“Mother, I’m trying to discover this.’’

38:44.900 --> 38:46.270
All right, you have it.

38:46.270 --> 38:48.550
“Mother I’m trying to get this job.’’

38:48.550 --> 38:51.310
You have it.

38:51.310 --> 38:59.670
Now, is the other way round.

38:59.670 --> 39:02.390
How many have dedication that of Christ?

39:02.390 --> 39:03.410
None.

39:03.410 --> 39:06.450
It’s a fact.

39:06.450 --> 39:11.100
Why is He the eldest brother?

39:11.100 --> 39:13.330
Because no-one like Him.

39:13.330 --> 39:26.040
He went through all those horrible sufferings,
because He was part and parcel of His Mother.

39:26.040 --> 39:30.100
She suffered much more than Him.

39:30.100 --> 39:35.930
He also went through that suffering for a
greater goal, for a greater happiness, for

39:35.930 --> 39:37.950
a greater life, for a wholesome life.

39:37.950 --> 39:45.940
That is real dedication.

39:45.940 --> 39:53.140
But the false people can take advantage of
this.

39:53.140 --> 39:57.800
When they make the people suffer, they say,
“after all, you have to suffer.”

39:57.800 --> 40:02.530
See how they make it up.

40:02.530 --> 40:09.270
“You must suffer because after all you must
suffer, otherwise you cannot rise.”

40:09.270 --> 40:19.230
It’s a very subtle understanding, very subtle
it is.

40:19.230 --> 40:25.750
That will make it clear to you that in Sahaja
Yoga first you are nourished, you are brought

40:25.750 --> 40:31.080
up, you are trained, you are made all right.

40:31.080 --> 40:37.330
And all the things after that, the sufferings,
are no more sufferings to you because you

40:37.330 --> 40:38.950
have become the Spirit.

40:38.950 --> 40:45.960
“Nainam chhidanti shashtrani, nainam dahti
pavkah, nainam kledanti aapoh, nainam shoshati

40:45.960 --> 40:56.540
marutah”: “It cannot be killed by any
instrument, it cannot be thrown away or blown

40:56.540 --> 41:02.430
away by any wind, it cannot be burnt by any
fire.”

41:02.430 --> 41:09.490
There’s no way you can destroy this.

41:09.490 --> 41:15.920
That is the Spirit that you are.

41:15.920 --> 41:19.030
So the nourishment has been given now.

41:19.030 --> 41:20.900
You have grown up.

41:20.900 --> 41:23.330
You are nourished.

41:23.330 --> 41:27.740
People when they see Sahaja Yogis, say, “Oh,
they are like flowers.

41:27.740 --> 41:30.080
See their faces, they glow.

41:30.080 --> 41:32.890
How confident, how dignified, how beautiful.”

41:32.890 --> 41:39.420
But for what?

41:39.420 --> 41:45.890
To be the wheels of the chariot of God.

41:45.890 --> 41:58.230
You have to bear the brunt, and the sacrifices,
which are no more sacrifices to you because

41:58.230 --> 42:02.160
Spirit gives, it never sacrifices.

42:02.160 --> 42:06.750
Its quality is to give.

42:06.750 --> 42:08.640
So you don’t sacrifice, you just give.

42:08.640 --> 42:20.180
First the mother has the labor pains, all
right, she has all the problems, all right.

42:20.180 --> 42:32.060
When the child is grown then he stands by
the mother.

42:32.060 --> 42:37.860
He is the proud son.

42:37.860 --> 42:41.430
She is proud of him and he is proud of her.

42:41.430 --> 42:47.300
They stand together, they fight the battle
together.

42:47.300 --> 42:59.150
That’s only possible if complete dedication
and preparation for the future life of a Sahaja

42:59.150 --> 43:01.980
Yogi, you accept.

43:01.980 --> 43:14.640
A life which outwardly looks to be a struggle,
a problem, but inwardly is most fulfilling.

43:14.640 --> 43:24.710
Once upon a time, when Sahaja Yogis come to
Me, to them even to sit on the ground is too

43:24.710 --> 43:30.670
much of a sacrifice; even to take out shoes
is a big sacrifice.

43:30.670 --> 43:35.750
Yesterday, in a program, three people walked
off because they were asked to take out shoes,

43:35.750 --> 43:39.660
as if somebody was making them bald-headed.

43:39.660 --> 43:48.830
They just walked off.

43:48.830 --> 43:54.110
But why to grow in Sahaja Yoga?

43:54.110 --> 44:01.800
To grow, to stand up like great children of
a great Mother.

44:01.800 --> 44:03.650
The work is tremendous.

44:03.650 --> 44:19.190
It’s not for medium, mediocre people to
do this job, frightened, fearful, arrogant,

44:19.190 --> 44:35.020
cheeky - they cannot, they have no mettle.

44:35.020 --> 44:50.270
So, the dedication in meditation, complete
dedication in meditation must be practiced.

44:50.270 --> 44:57.180
It’s not for your good now you are doing,
so-called “your”.

44:57.180 --> 45:02.860
First you were a little baby, a small thing;
now you are that collective being, so you

45:02.860 --> 45:07.200
are not doing anything for yourself, but for
that collective being.

45:07.200 --> 45:23.860
You are growing to be aware of that whole
which you are going to become.

45:23.860 --> 45:36.630
Your jobs, your money, your wives, your husbands,
your children, your father, mother, relations,

45:36.630 --> 45:43.460
these considerations are over now.

45:43.460 --> 45:49.400
You all have to take up the responsibility
of Sahaja Yoga.

45:49.400 --> 45:56.290
Every one of you is quite capable.

45:56.290 --> 46:04.000
You are brought up for that.

46:04.000 --> 46:13.660
Do whichever way you like, whatever are your
capacities.

46:13.660 --> 46:21.760
With full dedication you’ll get it.

46:21.760 --> 46:31.330
Dedication is the thing.

46:31.330 --> 46:38.460
Complete dedication is the only way you can
go further.

46:38.460 --> 46:43.650
There are some Sahaja Yogis, who are half-baked,
we have to drop them.

46:43.650 --> 46:46.000
We can’t help it.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.390
You don’t have sympathies with them.

46:48.390 --> 46:49.390
No good.

46:49.390 --> 46:53.890
If they prove all right we’ll bring them
back again, but you leave that to Me.

46:53.890 --> 46:58.160
You don’t put your effort or put your attention
to them.

46:58.160 --> 47:02.140
You have to come up.

47:02.140 --> 47:12.680
You were seekers, then you have found it,
now you have thrived over it, now you are

47:12.680 --> 47:14.220
grown up.

47:14.220 --> 47:15.760
For what?

47:15.760 --> 47:18.620
Is to stand up.

47:18.620 --> 47:27.110
As I am facing you today, you have to face
the others, you have to face the people.

47:27.110 --> 47:30.730
Dedication doesn’t mean that you don’t
talk of Sahaja Yoga.

47:30.730 --> 47:35.660
Many people think that keeping silent is the
way you are dedicated.

47:35.660 --> 47:40.170
Only in meditation you should be.

47:40.170 --> 47:45.140
But you have to get out of that shell.

47:45.140 --> 47:54.730
Tell all the nations and tell all the people,
all over, the great message that the time

47:54.730 --> 48:04.170
of Resurrection is here, now, at this time,
and that you all are capable of doing it.

48:04.170 --> 48:17.770
If somebody tries to sneer at you for that,
with understanding, wisdom, try to say things.

48:17.770 --> 48:25.180
Individual likes and dislikes must be sacrificed.

48:25.180 --> 48:31.830
“I like this” and “I like that” must
be given up.

48:31.830 --> 48:36.480
It doesn’t mean that you all become like
machines.

48:36.480 --> 48:37.850
No.

48:37.850 --> 48:43.530
But the enslavement to this “I” must be
given up.

48:43.530 --> 48:47.000
Enslavery to habits must be given up.

48:47.000 --> 48:52.280
You’ll be amazed.

48:52.280 --> 48:55.570
Once you are dedicated, you’ll not eat much.

48:55.570 --> 48:59.030
You may not eat at all sometimes.

48:59.030 --> 49:02.160
You wouldn’t even remember a food.

49:02.160 --> 49:04.790
You wouldn’t even remember what you have
eaten.

49:04.790 --> 49:13.970
You wouldn’t even remember where you slept,
how you slept.

49:13.970 --> 49:26.110
Is a life that will be like a telescope - expanding.

49:26.110 --> 49:34.620
You will create your own visions and complete
them, fulfill them.

49:34.620 --> 49:44.140
You look so simple, ordinary people, but you
are not.

49:44.140 --> 49:59.210
In dedication, in complete devotion, you have
to do it, now, not for your own gain, for

49:59.210 --> 50:03.650
your own achievement, that’s over now.

50:03.650 --> 50:15.210
Is for completely getting out of the mire
and standing on the land, singing aloud the

50:15.210 --> 50:20.410
praise of your Father.

50:20.410 --> 50:23.970
Those who are in the mire, what music can
they give?

50:23.970 --> 50:26.230
What songs they can sing?

50:26.230 --> 50:31.270
What security can they give?

50:31.270 --> 50:35.400
What help they can render to others?

50:35.400 --> 50:39.380
You have to be out of it, completely.

50:39.380 --> 50:47.810
Steadfast wisdom is needed for that, steadfast.

50:47.810 --> 50:53.600
Every moment.

50:53.600 --> 51:06.200
You need not blame your left side and right
side for that, nothing, you just get out of

51:06.200 --> 51:07.200
it.

51:07.200 --> 51:08.200
Cling on to it.

51:08.200 --> 51:11.930
The Parabrahma has come to look after you.

51:11.930 --> 51:14.210
Cling on to it.

51:14.210 --> 51:17.370
Even the death has to go back.

51:17.370 --> 51:22.270
Then what about these minor things?

51:22.270 --> 51:40.680
Now the name of your Mother is very powerful.

51:40.680 --> 51:53.840
You know that is the most powerful Name than
all other names, the most powerful mantra.

51:53.840 --> 51:57.470
But you must know how to take it.

51:57.470 --> 52:03.870
With that complete dedication you have to
take that Name.

52:03.870 --> 52:07.200
Not like any other name.

52:07.200 --> 52:13.460
You know that in India when take the name
of Guru, they pull their ears for taking the

52:13.460 --> 52:14.800
name of the Guru.

52:14.800 --> 52:22.160
Means, “While taking the Name if I am making
any mistakes, please forgive me” - means

52:22.160 --> 52:23.980
that.

52:23.980 --> 52:30.040
This mantra is a very powerful mantra.

52:30.040 --> 52:43.100
Only what you need is the dedication, the
dynamite of dedication.

52:43.100 --> 52:54.230
Today I told Rita that all the daisies in
England have fragrance now.

52:54.230 --> 52:55.270
She couldn’t believe it.

52:55.270 --> 52:57.770
She said, “I have never known that.

52:57.770 --> 53:04.460
On the contrary I always felt that daisies
had no fragrance and they were very funnily-smelling

53:04.460 --> 53:05.510
flowers.’’

53:05.510 --> 53:12.160
I said, “All right, these daisies you have,
just go and smell them.’’

53:12.160 --> 53:17.310
When she smelt it, she was surprised.

53:17.310 --> 53:21.770
The Name, how subtle it is.

53:21.770 --> 53:26.490
They are the most fragrant flowers of England
today.

53:26.490 --> 53:45.580
Just the Name; which means Nishkalanka, which
means Nirmala, which means completely without

53:45.580 --> 53:46.580
any mala.

53:46.580 --> 53:47.710
What is this, mala?

53:47.710 --> 53:50.870
Is this mire.

53:50.870 --> 53:55.340
Without any mire.

53:55.340 --> 53:56.830
Nil.

53:56.830 --> 53:58.330
Absolutely.

53:58.330 --> 54:03.520
The joy at the Sahasrara is called as Nirananda,
since long.

54:03.520 --> 54:08.480
Since ancient times called Nirananda or Nirmalananda.

54:08.480 --> 54:15.400
So many call it as Nirmalananda or Nirananda.

54:15.400 --> 54:22.700
That joy is the joy that you enjoy even when
you get crucified.

54:22.700 --> 54:27.650
That joy, you enjoy even when you are poisoned.

54:27.650 --> 54:32.450
Even on your deathbed, you enjoy that joy.

54:32.450 --> 54:35.830
That joy is Nirananda.

54:35.830 --> 54:43.540
So be prepared for the second phase.

54:43.540 --> 54:47.220
You are in the front.

54:47.220 --> 54:54.030
It’s very little time I need.

54:54.030 --> 55:02.070
But I need really people with steadfast wisdom
and dedication; steadfast.

55:02.070 --> 55:13.780
Even for a second it should not go this side
or that side.

55:13.780 --> 55:23.460
Then, we can progress faster, we can go ahead
to fight the battle.

55:23.460 --> 55:32.430
Perhaps now you are aware of the subtleties
of the negativities, how they work, how they

55:32.430 --> 55:42.350
use their power - of course which is limited
- to destroy God’s work, and how you have

55:42.350 --> 55:47.070
to be alert, equipped, and dedicated.

55:47.070 --> 56:03.610
This I can only talk to you, I cannot say
to the people who come to Caxton Hall.

56:03.610 --> 56:14.490
Some of them are half-baked, some of them
are absolutely new, naive, and some of them

56:14.490 --> 56:16.200
are absolutely third-raters.

56:16.200 --> 56:31.510
But here, as you are before Me today, I want
to tell you very frankly, as Krishna had told

56:31.510 --> 56:40.270
only Arjuna, “sarva dharmanam parityajya,
mamekam sharanam vraja”.

56:40.270 --> 56:45.750
There’s no other way out.

56:45.750 --> 56:58.120
Vraja means the one who is twice-born, like
a solid, solid personality.

56:58.120 --> 57:02.840
When you are solid then you must dedicate.

57:02.840 --> 57:07.730
When you are perfected then you must dedicate.

57:07.730 --> 57:21.150
It will help you to get out of the mire, and
then it will help the great cause.

57:21.150 --> 57:28.110
No one understands that why Mother is trying
to help us?

57:28.110 --> 57:32.030
Oh they think She’s too generous.

57:32.030 --> 57:33.110
I’m not.

57:33.110 --> 57:40.150
I’ve lot of common sense.

57:40.150 --> 57:55.330
Because you are the ones who are capable of
manifesting God’s joy on this earth.

57:55.330 --> 57:59.230
You are the flutes which are going to play
the melody of God.

57:59.230 --> 58:09.560
You are going to be used and maneuvered by
God.

58:09.560 --> 58:18.270
I am doing all this to perfect you, to be
the most beautiful instrument of God.

58:18.270 --> 58:21.880
To be the right instrument of God.

58:21.880 --> 58:37.630
I don’t know if you understand how sweet,
beautiful life it would be.

58:37.630 --> 58:52.110
The life of dedication, with understanding,
logical, completely dedicated, extracting

58:52.110 --> 59:03.360
all the nourishment, and dedicating it for
a higher purpose.

59:03.360 --> 59:20.350
Something like the leaves extract the sun’s
rays, and give color, achieve color for themselves,

59:20.350 --> 59:31.440
for a higher purpose, that they can be used
by human beings later on.

59:31.440 --> 59:37.420
Nothing on this earth works out the other
way round.

59:37.420 --> 59:56.740
Everything works out for a purpose; but such
an unselfish, such a wide, such a great, dynamic

59:56.740 --> 01:00:00.430
purpose.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:13.840
You become the ocean, you become the moon,
you become the sun, you become the earth,

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:21.070
you become the ether, the firmament, and you
become the Spirit.

01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:26.530
You work for all of them.

01:00:26.530 --> 01:00:35.150
All the stars and universes you become, and
take up their work.

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:42.710
That’s what it is.

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:47.420
Because you have jumped onto your principle,
onto your tattwa.

01:00:47.420 --> 01:00:52.390
That’s how you jump onto everybody’s tattwa.

01:00:52.390 --> 01:01:02.410
But be dedicated on that tattwa, because I
am the Principle of all these things.

01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:09.140
I am the tattwa - Tattvamasi, I am the Principle.

01:01:09.140 --> 01:01:17.580
Keep to your principle.

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:21.790
I am the Kundalini.

01:01:21.790 --> 01:01:27.460
I am the Essence.

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:35.080
We can only understand dedication of something
which looks bigger in gross ways, which appears

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.420
bigger in a gross way.

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:45.210
But we cannot dedicate ourselves to something
that is so much subtler, which is so much

01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:57.910
minuter, which is so much deeper, which is
so much effective, which is so much dynamic,

01:01:57.910 --> 01:02:01.000
so universal and so eternal.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:10.760
We cannot think of dedicating ourselves to
that.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.700
We can surrender ourselves to somebody who
looks like a mountain, who comes to oppress

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:21.980
us just like a mountain, who is like Hitler,
who is like a false guru.

01:02:21.980 --> 01:02:39.790
But to surrender to your subtler being, which
you cannot see with your eyes, which is not

01:02:39.790 --> 01:02:50.730
audible, but, in effect, is so powerful.

01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:55.090
Like the atomic bomb, when the atom is split.

01:02:55.090 --> 01:03:02.700
When it is not split, it’s everywhere.

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:15.140
But at the subtlest point it’s so dynamic
that, when you separate it, it becomes such

01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:18.240
a dynamic force of destruction.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:34.410
As your attention has now penetrated into
the subtler side of this universe, you get

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:40.369
deeper and deeper into.

01:03:40.369 --> 01:03:57.310
The urge that takes the end of the root to
the source of water, is the same as the source.

01:03:57.310 --> 01:04:09.600
Your Kundalini is the same as the Adi Kundalini
and its Power, the Parabrahma.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:23.240
All these things are to be understood after
Realization and after maturity.

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:25.190
Before that it’s not possible.

01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:30.770
That’s why for last eight years, I didn’t
say these things to you.

01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:41.690
I was always on a very patronizing and a sweet
terms with you.

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:47.810
And always, I made you feel that you are obliging
Me.

01:04:47.810 --> 01:04:56.920
There’s no obligation.

01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:05.790
But beyond all these conceptions, you have
become your Self.

01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:12.250
Now ready to be responsible, to be what you
are made for.

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:25.030
Like the ship is built, is brought to the
sea, tried, and found out to be sea-worthy,

01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:33.640
to sail out now, into the sea.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:42.240
So this is the second phase, where you have
to sail out, when you know everything about

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:47.450
the ship, everything about the sea.

01:05:47.450 --> 01:05:57.970
With complete freedom and wisdom, you have
to sail now, not afraid of any storms, or

01:05:57.970 --> 01:06:07.180
any hails, or any typhoons, because now on
you know, your job is to cross through.

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.910
May God bless you!

01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:10.640
May God bless you!

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.240
Should we meditate for a while?

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:30.810
Can you put off the lights?

01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:52.240
Such vibrations, I tell you.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:07:16.230
If you can form a chain, would be a good idea...

01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:20.110
[SOUNDS OF YOGIS SHIFTING]
 

01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:24.430
Just see where is Aradhana and Anupama and
also, who's there, Bhavila just look after

01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:25.430
them.

01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:26.430
And where is that.

01:07:26.430 --> 01:07:29.170
Kay, can you go down and also see where is
that lady?

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:32.040
This is a big house and they should not be
lost."
