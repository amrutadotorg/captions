00:32.490 --> 00:57.359
have it on Saturday dr. Calaway hello

00:47.129 --> 00:59.070
Halloween mother Halloween is an

00:57.359 --> 01:01.640
abbreviation of the term Hallows Eve

00:59.070 --> 01:01.640
because

01:42.200 --> 01:50.460
suspended indefinitely some new zombie

01:48.600 --> 01:55.259
is refuted to be all famous a mother the

01:50.460 --> 01:57.270
day of all the same that's what we

01:55.259 --> 02:00.869
didn't email all things they pursue any

01:57.270 --> 02:08.190
did anything we have it on Sunday all

02:00.869 --> 02:10.810
right Billy 43 it's very important

02:08.190 --> 02:18.460
because that is the day

02:10.810 --> 02:23.440
the goddess as a power as a power

02:18.460 --> 02:29.920
because it was kartikeya he did not pass

02:23.440 --> 02:35.490
whatever and he was one of the worst of

02:29.920 --> 02:39.220
all did not be killed so she WA and

02:35.490 --> 02:41.940
Parvati were married for the special

02:39.220 --> 02:45.010
purpose to produce this fault rule

02:41.940 --> 02:50.170
shucks people trapped in the front of

02:45.010 --> 02:54.480
the shop owners car together and he was

02:50.170 --> 02:59.640
just called to kill this horrible them

02:54.480 --> 03:03.250
fathers not possible and he kicked that

02:59.640 --> 03:06.250
is the day between three it's something

03:03.250 --> 03:09.730
like valuation that way because that is

03:06.250 --> 03:14.940
the day they open the gates of hand and

03:09.730 --> 03:17.890
put all these Devils in to help and

03:14.940 --> 03:25.959
that's why that the one has to rest in

03:17.890 --> 03:30.610
the body tonight because some of them

03:25.959 --> 03:35.080
might be hanging around better

03:30.610 --> 03:39.640
all of it I mean either then that you

03:35.080 --> 03:41.290
are you do not feel much stirring but if

03:39.640 --> 03:45.310
you ran in the realm of subconscious

03:41.290 --> 03:47.799
area of collective subconscious you can

03:45.310 --> 03:49.750
see even some of the spirits and also

03:47.799 --> 03:52.739
can feel their existence we see the

03:49.750 --> 03:52.739
blacks who are Sonora

03:52.940 --> 04:03.370
so that day is very dangerous but

03:58.130 --> 04:07.360
because Nana Karim escaped people

04:03.370 --> 04:11.950
celebrated that celebration it expects

04:07.360 --> 04:16.430
next year next day which that day is the

04:11.950 --> 04:18.530
day of Diwali to say it is America which

04:16.430 --> 04:22.400
needs sahaja yoga much more than any

04:18.530 --> 04:25.550
other country my concern for America is

04:22.400 --> 04:28.490
for the same reason I am NOT saying so

04:25.550 --> 04:31.460
much about South America but more about

04:28.490 --> 04:34.580
the North America but even in South

04:31.460 --> 04:45.740
America what I found is that it is a

04:34.580 --> 04:50.530
kind of a nation where they have no

04:45.740 --> 04:53.930
guidance at all about them no guidance

04:50.530 --> 04:57.170
openly that bring Carnaval these that I

04:53.930 --> 05:01.100
mean how can you do it in a country all

04:57.170 --> 05:04.400
those things they are following the

05:01.100 --> 05:05.780
footsteps of North America like in North

05:04.400 --> 05:08.090
America they have this Halloween

05:05.780 --> 05:11.480
nonsense I mean imagine openly on the

05:08.090 --> 05:14.000
street doing Halloween nonsense so they

05:11.480 --> 05:16.790
are following carnival to them uh what a

05:14.000 --> 05:19.580
thing it is to go to Rio as if there's a

05:16.790 --> 05:21.950
very big achievement and going into that

05:19.580 --> 05:28.100
carnival from all over the places from

05:21.950 --> 05:30.710
Australia people are coming down but the

05:28.100 --> 05:39.560
worst and the worst and the worst is the

05:30.710 --> 05:44.169
Hollywood is the film industry under the

05:39.560 --> 05:44.169
name of industry you can do anything now

05:44.830 --> 05:53.690
this Hollywood is creating such horrible

05:49.520 --> 05:57.620
films but the worst is that they get

05:53.690 --> 06:00.230
awards for these worst films this one

05:57.620 --> 06:03.860
film they sure I have not seen I can't

06:00.230 --> 06:04.529
see it they told me that a man is a

06:03.860 --> 06:07.409
cannibal

06:04.529 --> 06:13.949
he's eating the flesh of human beings

06:07.409 --> 06:16.979
and their soul and they enjoy very very

06:13.949 --> 06:18.839
famous apart from that not only famous

06:16.979 --> 06:23.759
but they got awards for the best film

06:18.839 --> 06:26.369
the best actor the best you must get a

06:23.759 --> 06:29.969
director from there and make him eat the

06:26.369 --> 06:31.619
flesh of human things it's the only way

06:29.969 --> 06:33.659
I think this horn with you

06:31.619 --> 06:36.139
then they are producing other pictures

06:33.659 --> 06:39.569
have seen another one for a short time

06:36.139 --> 06:46.349
where they shows all dead bodies hanging

06:39.569 --> 06:50.519
is it horrible why these people like to

06:46.349 --> 06:54.509
see such horrible things what is their

06:50.519 --> 06:58.379
character where have they gone why do

06:54.509 --> 07:03.860
they enjoy things which no human being

06:58.379 --> 07:03.860
who is a human being with Angela and

07:04.279 --> 07:11.459
then it goes further there hollowing

07:08.099 --> 07:14.729
business I saw a film castle my god this

07:11.459 --> 07:19.649
is a hell in which they thought it was

07:14.729 --> 07:21.360
like the wrath of Shri Krishna so it was

07:19.649 --> 07:25.379
Krishna consciousness I think that was

07:21.360 --> 07:28.409
working there there are thousand and one

07:25.379 --> 07:33.619
things which can shop you in America and

07:28.409 --> 07:33.619
also in England also in Europe

07:33.930 --> 07:55.860
