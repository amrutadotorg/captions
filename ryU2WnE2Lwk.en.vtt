00:01.230 --> 00:16.470
[Music]

00:20.380 --> 00:34.559
I know very well that Ganesha is the

00:25.689 --> 00:34.559
symbol of purity of sanctity and

00:35.370 --> 00:48.519
worshiping the innocence when you are

00:45.040 --> 00:52.799
worshipping Shri Ganesha you have to

00:48.519 --> 00:59.379
know that he's the embodiment of

00:52.799 --> 01:03.640
innocence so to be innocent is not

00:59.379 --> 01:08.070
possible you have to be innocent in the

01:03.640 --> 01:12.270
sense that you are innately innocent

01:08.070 --> 01:20.409
this happens after sahaja yoga after

01:12.270 --> 01:25.030
realization and your power to fight all

01:20.409 --> 01:31.840
these wrong negative feelings within you

01:25.030 --> 01:36.960
and without are absolutely supported

01:31.840 --> 01:40.149
protected by the mother of Shri Ganesha

01:36.960 --> 01:43.679
worship investiga Nisha improves your

01:40.149 --> 01:49.270
mooladhara improves your sense of shame

01:43.679 --> 01:52.869
improves of your own dignity self-esteem

01:49.270 --> 01:56.709
you dress up in a way that shows that

01:52.869 --> 01:59.469
you respect your body you talk in such a

01:56.709 --> 02:02.530
way that just shows that you respect

01:59.469 --> 02:05.439
your tongue your language you cannot

02:02.530 --> 02:10.420
have a foul mouth if you are in a sane

02:05.439 --> 02:14.590
person cannot have a mind that can abuse

02:10.420 --> 02:17.530
or can say horrible words I have seen in

02:14.590 --> 02:20.440
America they talk in such a funny manner

02:17.530 --> 02:23.530
that you are shocked there's no need to

02:20.440 --> 02:26.700
use these dirty words to express

02:23.530 --> 02:30.099
yourself with that your tongue is born

02:26.700 --> 02:32.200
so innocence is gone from your tongue

02:30.099 --> 02:34.299
if you have lost innocence from your

02:32.200 --> 02:37.900
tongue whatever you say will never come

02:34.299 --> 02:40.269
true will never come true but if you are

02:37.900 --> 02:41.469
innocent and your tongue is innocent and

02:40.269 --> 02:44.620
respect

02:41.469 --> 02:48.280
so the basic as you can see respect your

02:44.620 --> 02:50.920
innocence in every manner now in sahaja

02:48.280 --> 02:55.420
yoga also we have some people who just

02:50.920 --> 02:58.359
tick on hiepro critically and they have

02:55.420 --> 03:03.099
kanesha problem and there are some who

02:58.359 --> 03:06.459
support this fellow can say oh I was

03:03.099 --> 03:10.349
such a sick man and I have no wife or I

03:06.459 --> 03:15.549
had no love from my parents or anything

03:10.349 --> 03:19.419
and others start supporting this kind of

03:15.549 --> 03:21.760
sympathy is very dangerous is extremely

03:19.419 --> 03:25.269
dangerous first of all this sympathy

03:21.760 --> 03:29.079
raise that person who cannot get over

03:25.269 --> 03:33.370
his problems and gradually you also pick

03:29.079 --> 03:36.099
up these problems instead of helping him

03:33.370 --> 03:38.639
that you do the meditation of and he

03:36.099 --> 03:43.239
shall you just sit on the mother earth

03:38.639 --> 03:45.790
see a say a thorough shisha use the

03:43.239 --> 03:49.780
paddle your problem will go away instead

03:45.790 --> 03:53.290
of that they start sympathizing this is

03:49.780 --> 03:57.970
not sympathy is sympathy means to share

03:53.290 --> 04:01.419
but he means pathos so you share all the

03:57.970 --> 04:04.750
problems of that person yourself so

04:01.419 --> 04:06.549
never supported wrong thing if you

04:04.750 --> 04:09.069
really love that person you care for

04:06.549 --> 04:11.229
that person you have to tell that person

04:09.069 --> 04:11.709
this is wrong this is wrong this is

04:11.229 --> 04:15.030
wrong

04:11.709 --> 04:19.510
that's why Ganesha is worshipped first

04:15.030 --> 04:24.699
because Ganesha was the first deity that

04:19.510 --> 04:28.090
was created by a discipline because if

04:24.699 --> 04:30.460
she has to create something she must

04:28.090 --> 04:33.699
know that there has to be power of

04:30.460 --> 04:35.770
innocence otherwise people will go wrong

04:33.699 --> 04:39.360
they'll do all kinds of wrong things so

04:35.770 --> 04:42.400
first she created Ganesha whose

04:39.360 --> 04:46.870
innocence you can call the vibration

04:42.400 --> 04:49.060
are so strong that it controls of course

04:46.870 --> 04:52.180
there are people who have I wonder

04:49.060 --> 04:53.830
abandoned completely their innocence and

04:52.180 --> 04:57.419
they think no end of themselves let's

04:53.830 --> 05:00.130
forget about it but normally normally

04:57.419 --> 05:03.460
you are always guided by your own

05:00.130 --> 05:07.780
innocence whether you are aware of it or

05:03.460 --> 05:12.190
not and that is such a sweet such a

05:07.780 --> 05:14.410
sweet thing that it makes people driving

05:12.190 --> 05:18.100
their nobleness in their greatness and

05:14.410 --> 05:19.090
that is what we have to develop in us

05:18.100 --> 05:22.900
the sahaja Yogi's

05:19.090 --> 05:25.930
well sahaja Yogi's go anywhere try to do

05:22.900 --> 05:29.289
anything meet anybody any social work

05:25.930 --> 05:33.610
anything people should feel that joy

05:29.289 --> 05:38.669
that you have within us it's for that

05:33.610 --> 05:42.699
joy only they initially created Shri

05:38.669 --> 05:46.389
Ganesha because that joy which is rough

05:42.699 --> 05:48.639
innocent Java it doesn't harm anybody we

05:46.389 --> 05:51.310
don't expect anything we doesn't demand

05:48.639 --> 05:56.020
anything they don't want anything but

05:51.310 --> 05:58.870
just emitting joy all over that sort of

05:56.020 --> 06:01.750
personality you should have there's

05:58.870 --> 06:04.180
nothing wrong in wearing good dresses

06:01.750 --> 06:09.580
nothing wrong in eating good food

06:04.180 --> 06:13.270
nothing wrong in having conversation but

06:09.580 --> 06:15.669
in all that it is the respect of the

06:13.270 --> 06:19.539
innocence the expression of innocence

06:15.669 --> 06:22.690
should be there with this innocence we

06:19.539 --> 06:24.909
can solve the problems all the problems

06:22.690 --> 06:28.539
of the world can be solved that's why

06:24.909 --> 06:33.099
Shri Ganesha is so important if you do

06:28.539 --> 06:37.330
not have proper understanding of Shri

06:33.099 --> 06:39.699
Ganesha and if you're still Ganesha is

06:37.330 --> 06:42.780
energy Oh party I don't know what can

06:39.699 --> 06:46.930
happen to you these days see so many

06:42.780 --> 06:49.120
horrible diseases are coming because

06:46.930 --> 06:52.029
they are not sanctified the

06:49.120 --> 06:55.860
relationships are not sanctified every

06:52.029 --> 06:58.380
relationship has to be sanctified with

06:55.860 --> 07:02.340
like you have a system you have a mother

06:58.380 --> 07:05.340
you have a brother you have a father

07:02.340 --> 07:07.950
you have all these relationships this

07:05.340 --> 07:11.130
all relationships they are so good so

07:07.950 --> 07:14.790
beautiful and sanctified because we're

07:11.130 --> 07:17.670
in the relationship of innocence you

07:14.790 --> 07:19.620
love your father out of innocence and

07:17.670 --> 07:22.730
you love your daughter out of innocence

07:19.620 --> 07:25.980
you love your mother out of innocence

07:22.730 --> 07:29.280
why should you love for some sort of a

07:25.980 --> 07:35.010
gain then it's cunning but some sort of

07:29.280 --> 07:37.590
I am overpowering then it's cunning it

07:35.010 --> 07:40.380
just for love love sake that's possible

07:37.590 --> 07:42.300
if you're innocent innocence works out

07:40.380 --> 07:44.190
in everything you see because everybody

07:42.300 --> 07:48.230
has little bit of innocence in you have

07:44.190 --> 07:52.800
given a sentence so you can it's like a

07:48.230 --> 07:55.710
fifth columnist to see the innocence is

07:52.800 --> 07:56.850
the fifth power within you so if any

07:55.710 --> 07:58.560
person is innocent

07:56.850 --> 08:01.020
you see if he'll work out on your fifth

07:58.560 --> 08:04.200
column and will make your right when you

08:01.020 --> 08:06.900
give wonder to others what happens you

08:04.200 --> 08:09.930
actually bind him by your innocence and

08:06.900 --> 08:12.390
the poor Caravelle know he has his

08:09.930 --> 08:14.640
innocence within it to capture that

08:12.390 --> 08:17.960
innocence that's how we are there that's

08:14.640 --> 08:22.680
how you make it sensible to work out the

08:17.960 --> 08:26.910
only principle the third father whole

08:22.680 --> 08:30.540
thing rests on what that one is nothing

08:26.910 --> 08:33.060
but innocence so try to develop this

08:30.540 --> 08:35.550
vibe all these things are in 1880

08:33.060 --> 08:37.740
imaginary good morning traversing not

08:35.550 --> 08:39.780
these not these not there is not these

08:37.740 --> 08:44.820
not these to all your thoughts not this

08:39.780 --> 08:48.710
not this not is not you reach them not

08:44.820 --> 08:48.710
my not my not my not

08:50.450 --> 08:57.740
and that is how it is and you see the

08:53.420 --> 09:03.080
whole material world is now attacking

08:57.740 --> 09:05.570
innocence because they're frightened you

09:03.080 --> 09:07.550
cannot attack innocence cannot be

09:05.570 --> 09:11.720
destroyed it cannot be destroyed in a

09:07.550 --> 09:14.060
sense if something is all-pervading and

09:11.720 --> 09:16.010
it cannot destroy it so whatever people

09:14.060 --> 09:20.750
may try it cannot be disturbed but it

09:16.010 --> 09:25.820
can be covered it can recede but it

09:20.750 --> 09:29.030
cannot it will act it's only now many

09:25.820 --> 09:32.630
people have a feeling also that we have

09:29.030 --> 09:36.680
lost our innocence that is something an

09:32.630 --> 09:41.900
eternal quality you have what you never

09:36.680 --> 09:45.200
lose your innocence maybe as clouds can

09:41.900 --> 09:47.090
cover the whole sky maybe your ego and

09:45.200 --> 09:49.970
conditionings and your mistakes might

09:47.090 --> 09:54.590
have covered it but it is always there

09:49.970 --> 09:58.820
always there only thing it is for you to

09:54.590 --> 10:06.530
respect it to behave in a manner that

09:58.820 --> 10:09.740
you respect your innocence not to feel

10:06.530 --> 10:12.560
shy about your innocence never your

10:09.740 --> 10:19.030
innocence itself is a power and your

10:12.560 --> 10:19.030
innocence will definitely give you that

10:21.310 --> 10:30.290
wisdom by which you can solve all the

10:25.520 --> 10:32.990
problems without any difficulty but in a

10:30.290 --> 10:41.020
deeper way if you see who is Shri

10:32.990 --> 10:45.490
Ganesha he is the child of Adi Shakti

10:41.020 --> 10:48.890
she created from the Okara

10:45.490 --> 10:55.990
now Okara is the logos as you call it is

10:48.890 --> 10:58.980
the first sound when she Sadashiva and

10:55.990 --> 11:05.790
adi shakti separated

10:58.980 --> 11:15.400
for creation that sound is used as Okara

11:05.790 --> 11:20.890
which are vibrations which have light in

11:15.400 --> 11:26.530
it they have all the causals of all the

11:20.890 --> 11:31.240
elements only on the right side then

11:26.530 --> 11:35.380
left side it has the power of your

11:31.240 --> 11:40.680
emotions in the center it has the power

11:35.380 --> 11:40.680
of your ascent so it's a very powerful

11:41.280 --> 11:56.770
deity we have and he is playful children

11:49.180 --> 12:01.900
are seldom cruel he is not cruel but if

11:56.770 --> 12:03.840
anything is done against the mother then

12:01.900 --> 12:08.710
he goes all wild

12:03.840 --> 12:13.440
then he punishes and that is how the

12:08.710 --> 12:13.440
divine justice is brought to people

12:15.680 --> 12:24.290
thus if he surrender to Shri Ganesh he

12:19.550 --> 12:26.930
protects us he gives us wisdom he gives

12:24.290 --> 12:31.250
a proper understanding the protocol of

12:26.930 --> 12:37.340
the mother he does not know any other

12:31.250 --> 12:42.080
deity but his mother he doesn't bother

12:37.340 --> 12:44.390
about any other deity but his mother and

12:42.080 --> 12:51.920
he knows that she's the most powerful

12:44.390 --> 12:55.160
deity and this is his wisdom which must

12:51.920 --> 13:00.110
be imbibed when you pray you must try to

12:55.160 --> 13:06.740
invite that that Shri Ganesha please be

13:00.110 --> 13:09.860
kind and merciful and forgiving that you

13:06.740 --> 13:12.110
manifest within ourselves let all these

13:09.860 --> 13:15.860
hypocritical things all these

13:12.110 --> 13:20.860
conditionings and all these wrong ideas

13:15.860 --> 13:24.830
we have all the wrong life we have had

13:20.860 --> 13:30.170
should just disappear like thin air I'll

13:24.830 --> 13:32.780
let the beautiful moonlight of your

13:30.170 --> 13:36.800
soothing qualities of innocence be

13:32.780 --> 13:40.310
manifested through us so preserve your

13:36.800 --> 13:43.420

13:40.310 --> 13:47.240
important to preserve your innocence

13:43.420 --> 13:52.490
that Shri Ganesh should be awakened

13:47.240 --> 13:55.550
within you and also in other men that is

13:52.490 --> 13:59.240
going to save this world nothing else

13:55.550 --> 14:02.780

13:59.240 --> 14:05.750
to save them whatever you may know

14:05.750 --> 14:12.130
write please see that you are not

14:08.480 --> 14:16.450
hurting the innocence within

14:12.130 --> 14:19.750
it's not necessary to lead a life of

14:16.450 --> 14:22.600
morality it is that what is needed is
