00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:16.470
[Music]

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:34.559
I know very well that Ganesha is the

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:34.559
symbol of purity of sanctity and

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:48.519
worshiping the innocence when you are

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.799
worshipping Shri Ganesha you have to

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:59.379
know that he's the embodiment of

00:00:52.799 --> 00:01:03.640
innocence so to be innocent is not

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:08.070
possible you have to be innocent in the

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:12.270
sense that you are innately innocent

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:20.409
this happens after sahaja yoga after

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:25.030
realization and your power to fight all

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:31.840
these wrong negative feelings within you

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:36.960
and without are absolutely supported

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:40.149
protected by the mother of Shri Ganesha

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.679
worship investiga Nisha improves your

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:49.270
mooladhara improves your sense of shame

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:52.869
improves of your own dignity self-esteem

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.709
you dress up in a way that shows that

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.469
you respect your body you talk in such a

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:02.530
way that just shows that you respect

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:05.439
your tongue your language you cannot

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.420
have a foul mouth if you are in a sane

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:14.590
person cannot have a mind that can abuse

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.530
or can say horrible words I have seen in

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.440
America they talk in such a funny manner

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.530
that you are shocked there's no need to

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.700
use these dirty words to express

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.099
yourself with that your tongue is born

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.200
so innocence is gone from your tongue

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.299
if you have lost innocence from your

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.900
tongue whatever you say will never come

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:40.269
true will never come true but if you are

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.469
innocent and your tongue is innocent and

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.620
respect

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:48.280
so the basic as you can see respect your

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.920
innocence in every manner now in sahaja

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.420
yoga also we have some people who just

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.359
tick on hiepro critically and they have

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:03.099
kanesha problem and there are some who

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:06.459
support this fellow can say oh I was

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:10.349
such a sick man and I have no wife or I

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:15.549
had no love from my parents or anything

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:19.419
and others start supporting this kind of

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.760
sympathy is very dangerous is extremely

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:25.269
dangerous first of all this sympathy

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:29.079
raise that person who cannot get over

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:33.370
his problems and gradually you also pick

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:36.099
up these problems instead of helping him

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.639
that you do the meditation of and he

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:43.239
shall you just sit on the mother earth

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:45.790
see a say a thorough shisha use the

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:49.780
paddle your problem will go away instead

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:53.290
of that they start sympathizing this is

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:57.970
not sympathy is sympathy means to share

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:01.419
but he means pathos so you share all the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.750
problems of that person yourself so

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:06.549
never supported wrong thing if you

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.069
really love that person you care for

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:11.229
that person you have to tell that person

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.709
this is wrong this is wrong this is

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:15.030
wrong

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:19.510
that's why Ganesha is worshipped first

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:24.699
because Ganesha was the first deity that

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:28.090
was created by a discipline because if

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:30.460
she has to create something she must

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.699
know that there has to be power of

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.770
innocence otherwise people will go wrong

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:39.360
they'll do all kinds of wrong things so

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:42.400
first she created Ganesha whose

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.870
innocence you can call the vibration

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:49.060
are so strong that it controls of course

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.180
there are people who have I wonder

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.830
abandoned completely their innocence and

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.419
they think no end of themselves let's

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:00.130
forget about it but normally normally

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:03.460
you are always guided by your own

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:07.780
innocence whether you are aware of it or

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:12.190
not and that is such a sweet such a

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:14.410
sweet thing that it makes people driving

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.100
their nobleness in their greatness and

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.090
that is what we have to develop in us

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.900
the sahaja Yogi's

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:25.930
well sahaja Yogi's go anywhere try to do

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:29.289
anything meet anybody any social work

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:33.610
anything people should feel that joy

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:38.669
that you have within us it's for that

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:42.699
joy only they initially created Shri

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:46.389
Ganesha because that joy which is rough

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:48.639
innocent Java it doesn't harm anybody we

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.310
don't expect anything we doesn't demand

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:56.020
anything they don't want anything but

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:58.870
just emitting joy all over that sort of

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:01.750
personality you should have there's

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:04.180
nothing wrong in wearing good dresses

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:09.580
nothing wrong in eating good food

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:13.270
nothing wrong in having conversation but

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:15.669
in all that it is the respect of the

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:19.539
innocence the expression of innocence

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:22.690
should be there with this innocence we

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:24.909
can solve the problems all the problems

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:28.539
of the world can be solved that's why

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:33.099
Shri Ganesha is so important if you do

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:37.330
not have proper understanding of Shri

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:39.699
Ganesha and if you're still Ganesha is

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.780
energy Oh party I don't know what can

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:46.930
happen to you these days see so many

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:49.120
horrible diseases are coming because

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:52.029
they are not sanctified the

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.860
relationships are not sanctified every

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:58.380
relationship has to be sanctified with

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:02.340
like you have a system you have a mother

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:05.340
you have a brother you have a father

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.950
you have all these relationships this

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:11.130
all relationships they are so good so

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:14.790
beautiful and sanctified because we're

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:17.670
in the relationship of innocence you

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:19.620
love your father out of innocence and

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:22.730
you love your daughter out of innocence

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:25.980
you love your mother out of innocence

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:29.280
why should you love for some sort of a

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:35.010
gain then it's cunning but some sort of

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:37.590
I am overpowering then it's cunning it

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:40.380
just for love love sake that's possible

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.300
if you're innocent innocence works out

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.190
in everything you see because everybody

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:48.230
has little bit of innocence in you have

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:52.800
given a sentence so you can it's like a

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:55.710
fifth columnist to see the innocence is

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.850
the fifth power within you so if any

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.560
person is innocent

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:01.020
you see if he'll work out on your fifth

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:04.200
column and will make your right when you

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:06.900
give wonder to others what happens you

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:09.930
actually bind him by your innocence and

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:12.390
the poor Caravelle know he has his

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:14.640
innocence within it to capture that

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:17.960
innocence that's how we are there that's

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:22.680
how you make it sensible to work out the

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:26.910
only principle the third father whole

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:30.540
thing rests on what that one is nothing

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:33.060
but innocence so try to develop this

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:35.550
vibe all these things are in 1880

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:37.740
imaginary good morning traversing not

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:39.780
these not these not there is not these

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:44.820
not these to all your thoughts not this

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:48.710
not this not is not you reach them not

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:48.710
my not my not my not

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:57.740
and that is how it is and you see the

00:08:53.420 --> 00:09:03.080
whole material world is now attacking

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:05.570
innocence because they're frightened you

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.550
cannot attack innocence cannot be

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:11.720
destroyed it cannot be destroyed in a

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:14.060
sense if something is all-pervading and

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.010
it cannot destroy it so whatever people

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:20.750
may try it cannot be disturbed but it

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:25.820
can be covered it can recede but it

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:29.030
cannot it will act it's only now many

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:32.630
people have a feeling also that we have

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:36.680
lost our innocence that is something an

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:41.900
eternal quality you have what you never

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:45.200
lose your innocence maybe as clouds can

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:47.090
cover the whole sky maybe your ego and

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.970
conditionings and your mistakes might

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:54.590
have covered it but it is always there

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:58.820
always there only thing it is for you to

00:09:54.590 --> 00:10:06.530
respect it to behave in a manner that

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:09.740
you respect your innocence not to feel

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:12.560
shy about your innocence never your

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:19.030
innocence itself is a power and your

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:19.030
innocence will definitely give you that

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:30.290
wisdom by which you can solve all the

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:32.990
problems without any difficulty but in a

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:41.020
deeper way if you see who is Shri

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:45.490
Ganesha he is the child of Adi Shakti

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:48.890
she created from the Okara

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:55.990
now Okara is the logos as you call it is

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:58.980
the first sound when she Sadashiva and

00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:05.790
adi shakti separated

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:15.400
for creation that sound is used as Okara

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:20.890
which are vibrations which have light in

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:26.530
it they have all the causals of all the

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:31.240
elements only on the right side then

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:35.380
left side it has the power of your

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:40.680
emotions in the center it has the power

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:40.680
of your ascent so it's a very powerful

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:56.770
deity we have and he is playful children

00:11:49.180 --> 00:12:01.900
are seldom cruel he is not cruel but if

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:03.840
anything is done against the mother then

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:08.710
he goes all wild

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:13.440
then he punishes and that is how the

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:13.440
divine justice is brought to people

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:24.290
thus if he surrender to Shri Ganesh he

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:26.930
protects us he gives us wisdom he gives

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:31.250
a proper understanding the protocol of

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:37.340
the mother he does not know any other

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:42.080
deity but his mother he doesn't bother

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:44.390
about any other deity but his mother and

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:51.920
he knows that she's the most powerful

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:55.160
deity and this is his wisdom which must

00:12:51.920 --> 00:13:00.110
be imbibed when you pray you must try to

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:06.740
invite that that Shri Ganesha please be

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:09.860
kind and merciful and forgiving that you

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:12.110
manifest within ourselves let all these

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:15.860
hypocritical things all these

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:20.860
conditionings and all these wrong ideas

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:24.830
we have all the wrong life we have had

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:30.170
should just disappear like thin air I'll

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:32.780
let the beautiful moonlight of your

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:36.800
soothing qualities of innocence be

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:40.310
manifested through us so preserve your

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:43.420
innocence in these modern times is very
