WEBVTT

00:09.210 --> 00:19.850
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:19.850 --> 00:33.980
I am very happy that this book is now published
and a subtler side, a deeper dimension of

00:33.980 --> 00:40.809
‘Gita’ is being brought, to the readers.

00:40.809 --> 01:02.010
As Krishna was a great diplomat and understood
that human beings are very clever and they

01:02.010 --> 01:06.230
cannot accept truth in a straightforward manner.

01:06.230 --> 01:19.590
He, in His advice to Arjuna used His diplomacy
and the essence of His diplomacy is always

01:19.590 --> 01:31.939
specially of the defined, Divine Diplomacy
which He used that give absurd conditions

01:31.939 --> 01:41.040
and solutions to such difficult people who
are so proud of their limited intellect.

01:41.040 --> 01:46.850
That’s a difference between a father and
a mother I should say.

01:46.850 --> 01:49.240
As we say in Hindi ‘Sidhe Haath ghee na
nikle tho tedhii ungli karni pardti hai’

01:49.240 --> 01:51.420
[Meaning: when we can’t take out ghee with
straight finger, we have to bend our finger.

01:51.420 --> 01:56.670
Famous proverb implying that when we can’t
get a work done in a straight way, we need

01:56.670 --> 02:00.920
to bend our ways.].

02:00.920 --> 02:13.790
The first and foremost thing we have to understand
that Shri Krishna is a Divine incarnation

02:13.790 --> 02:25.980
and He came at a time where we needed to understand
what is the essence of dharma.

02:25.980 --> 02:39.140
For example I have been quite surprised the
way people explain Him as far as the hinsa

02:39.140 --> 02:41.860
is concerned.

02:41.860 --> 02:46.890
That Shri Krishna preached ahinsa to such
an extent that we have to look after all the

02:46.890 --> 02:48.640
mosquitoes of Delhi.

02:48.640 --> 03:08.290
Such absurd things people have deducted by
what Krishna tried to emphasize in Shri Gita.

03:08.290 --> 03:22.910
When the war started, Arjuna actually became
nervous I can say and He said, “I would

03:22.910 --> 03:29.030
not like to fight My own kith and kin and
My Gurus.

03:29.030 --> 03:30.030
”

03:30.030 --> 03:38.200
So Shri Krishna says, “They are already
dead, they are killed.

03:38.200 --> 03:43.140
Because they were not enlightened people,
are already dead people their eyes are not

03:43.140 --> 03:44.140
open.

03:44.140 --> 03:49.170
Whom are You going to kill here?

03:49.170 --> 03:55.440
Just You have to remove some people from this
Earth to establish Dharma.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.440
”

03:56.440 --> 04:02.481
Now the idea of Dharma according to us is
some sort of a Hinduism or Islamism or some

04:02.481 --> 04:06.380
sort of a ism; it is not.

04:06.380 --> 04:14.140
Dharma is the valency in a human being just
like carbon has four valencies; dharma has

04:14.140 --> 04:16.570
ten valencies in a human being.

04:16.570 --> 04:23.250
And when a person falls down from there then
he loses his powers as a human being.

04:23.250 --> 04:32.370
One of the examples He said at the time of
war – Karna the great generous man very

04:32.370 --> 04:45.210
well known for His great virtues was caught
up by a wheel of His chariot and He could

04:45.210 --> 04:49.250
not take out His leg out of that chariot.

04:49.250 --> 05:07.320
When Arjuna faced Him and raised His own Gandiva
and Karna challenged Him saying that, “I

05:07.320 --> 05:21.759
am a Vira” – a chivalrous person, a person
who is fighting, “and You are another warrior

05:21.759 --> 05:33.300
and in Dharma when I have no weapons on Me,
You cannot kill Me with Your weapon.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.300
”

05:34.300 --> 05:39.720
That time Shri Krishna pointed at Him like
this and He said, “Kill Him.

05:39.720 --> 05:47.730
Where was His warrior virtues when Draupadi
was insulted?

05:47.730 --> 05:55.879
Draupadi’s insult was the greatest sin that
was committed and what was He doing at that

05:55.879 --> 05:59.249
time?”

05:59.249 --> 06:04.039
And Arjuna killed Karna.

06:04.039 --> 06:08.729
This is Dharma.

06:08.729 --> 06:23.740
He’s called as the Leeladhara – the one
for Him the whole world is a play.

06:23.740 --> 06:29.610
And that’s why He says that already they
are killed.

06:29.610 --> 06:35.860
That doesn’t mean that you start killing
people, becoming violent because you do not

06:35.860 --> 06:38.360
agree with some people.

06:38.360 --> 06:43.659
Shri Krishna can say whom to kill.

06:43.659 --> 06:53.039
You have to be a realized soul to understand
why Shri Krishna had to ask Him to kill and

06:53.039 --> 07:01.159
why the Goddess had to kill so many demons.

07:01.159 --> 07:13.620
But the idea today is – we should try to
be sympathetic towards also demons and the

07:13.620 --> 07:20.789
devils who are spreading ‘asuri vidya’
everywhere.

07:20.789 --> 07:25.809
And we should be sympathetic with all the
people and there is good in everyone.

07:25.809 --> 07:29.099
That is not Krishna’s message.

07:29.099 --> 07:38.860
He showed His love by killing the demons.

07:38.860 --> 07:47.349
I don’t know in this book if I have talked
on this point or not because he had very limited

07:47.349 --> 07:53.380
subjects, which he dealt with, and I didn’t
want to pressurize him with some new subject

07:53.380 --> 07:54.380
matters.

07:54.380 --> 08:00.180
But there’s one thing definitely, which
I didn’t say there which is a very important

08:00.180 --> 08:03.509
point one should try to see.

08:03.509 --> 08:19.259
That the awareness – ‘Chetana’, the
awareness, grows downward of a human being

08:19.259 --> 08:27.830
and the roots of the tree of the awareness
are in the brain.

08:27.830 --> 08:37.150
So one has to take to ‘urdvagati’ – means
the ascent and not to the descent.

08:37.150 --> 08:47.140
A human being is born in the Bhavasagara,
which is as we call in the void, as you can

08:47.140 --> 08:50.690
see here clearly in Sahaja Yoga.

08:50.690 --> 08:54.880
Either he can go upward or he can go downward.

08:54.880 --> 09:05.600
Now see the, how the human awareness has reached
‘adhogati’ – is a downward descent.

09:05.600 --> 09:13.010
Very simple to see if you understand what
Krishna meant that the roots are in the brain?

09:13.010 --> 09:21.510
When I’ve been in the Western countries
I realize it’s much more because they are

09:21.510 --> 09:28.660
supposed to be advanced, developed, sophisticated,
educated, intellectuals, whatever you may

09:28.660 --> 09:30.320
call them.

09:30.320 --> 09:37.870
I’ve been to all Communists countries and
all the democracies and all kinds of isms.

09:37.870 --> 09:47.710
What I realized that exactly what Shri Krishna
had said that asuri vidya will take over.

09:47.710 --> 09:52.350
The descent of awareness is seen clearly in
those countries.

09:52.350 --> 09:56.230
Thank God we are not that advanced.

09:56.230 --> 10:06.841
The descent starts from the Nabhi Chakra as
we call it where a person starts seeking the

10:06.841 --> 10:15.780
food this that and other requirements, then
it starts moving downwards.

10:15.780 --> 10:20.290
The essence of the Nabhi Chakra is ‘Swaha’.

10:20.290 --> 10:23.470
‘Swaha’ is the consumption.

10:23.470 --> 10:28.460
It consumes everything, it aggresses everything,
consumes, just like the fire.

10:28.460 --> 10:33.790
In the same way once upon a time these developed
countries spread all over the world started

10:33.790 --> 10:39.200
consuming everyone.

10:39.200 --> 10:45.240
Ruling our country, China, all kinds of countries,
they went round all over the world.

10:45.240 --> 10:51.200
Thank God Columbus missed his point otherwise
we would not have been here.

10:51.200 --> 11:00.640
He went to America and you cannot find aboriginals
unless and until you enter into some far fetched

11:00.640 --> 11:04.840
places like Peru.

11:04.840 --> 11:12.670
Then the consumption of money on the economic
ground started.

11:12.670 --> 11:20.880
Then the consumption of the Mother Earth started
at the ‘Bhu’ level.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.770
But the ‘Bhurva’ is the ‘Antariksha’
in the whole Universe.

11:24.770 --> 11:29.340
We are going to the Sun, we are going to the
moon, we are going to this, we are going to

11:29.340 --> 11:30.340
that.

11:30.340 --> 11:34.070
What about going inside in the ascent?

11:34.070 --> 11:43.470
Now little bit they are seeing it that there’s
intelligence also plus the energy.

11:43.470 --> 11:51.520
But you are seeing it from the outside.

11:51.520 --> 11:57.340
That’s the intelligence of God Almighty,
whether you like it or not.

11:57.340 --> 12:05.870
So now we are going to the ‘Antarikshas’,
we are going to all these Universes to find

12:05.870 --> 12:06.870
what?

12:06.870 --> 12:14.750
So the ‘Bhurva’ is the essence – the
‘Antariksha’.

12:14.750 --> 12:17.700
Awareness reached there also.

12:17.700 --> 12:23.930
Then it has gone further.

12:23.930 --> 12:31.620
In the Sahaja Yoga we can say that from Nabhi
chakra they started moving downwards towards

12:31.620 --> 12:38.450
the Swadishthana, which deals with the Antariksha,
with the Universes, which was created by the

12:38.450 --> 12:40.760
Creator Brahmadeva.

12:40.760 --> 12:51.631
Below that they moved again, comes the Mooladhara,
which is the essence of human life, which

12:51.631 --> 12:54.440
is the support of human life.

12:54.440 --> 13:00.570
For which Christ Himself has said, “Thou
shall not have adulterous eyes.

13:00.570 --> 13:08.250
” I have yet to find real Christians of
that kind who do not have adulterous eyes.

13:08.250 --> 13:18.240
And that’s why people have gone to now nothing
but they have become sex points, I can tell

13:18.240 --> 13:19.240
you.

13:19.240 --> 13:28.320
The whole awareness of your intellectual movement
has gone to nothing but to this filth beyond

13:28.320 --> 13:29.320
Ganesha.

13:29.320 --> 13:35.940
You have left everything that was holy, that
was auspicious, much behind and crossed, and

13:35.940 --> 13:43.250
one step forward and the hell is there, the
hell.

13:43.250 --> 13:50.210
Where our awareness is going today?

13:50.210 --> 13:55.380
But we have not thought of the ‘urdvagati’
that Shri Krishna has said.

13:55.380 --> 14:02.500
Giving lectures on Shri Krishna, having bhajans
about Shri Krishna, makes no difference.

14:02.500 --> 14:06.200
What about the urdvagati?

14:06.200 --> 14:10.400
In the sixth century a great saint Gyaneshwara
was born.

14:10.400 --> 14:16.250
In the sixth chapter of Gyaneshwari He’s
clearly described, is the Kundalini, which

14:16.250 --> 14:21.510
is going to raise you higher, very clearly,
openly He said it.

14:21.510 --> 14:24.820
Of course as usual everybody tortured His
life.

14:24.820 --> 14:32.870
He didn’t have sometimes water to drink,
that’s different.

14:32.870 --> 14:40.130
In the sixth chapter when He described, even
today in Maharashtra it is said that sixth

14:40.130 --> 14:41.130
chapter is tabooed.

14:41.130 --> 14:45.590
You are not supposed to read the sixth chapter
of Gyaneshwari.

14:45.590 --> 14:46.700
Why?

14:46.700 --> 14:57.380
Because they don’t know a word about Kundalini
and they don’t know how to ascend?

14:57.380 --> 15:04.410
Because it is the knowledge of the roots you
have to go to.

15:04.410 --> 15:14.100
If you are honest please try to understand
that what Shri Krishna has said that the roots

15:14.100 --> 15:24.880
are in the brain and the awareness grows towards
‘adhogati’.

15:24.880 --> 15:31.280
He did not say precisely that Kundalini is
the one that gives you the urdvagati.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.670
He did not say; that was not the time.

15:33.670 --> 15:40.130
At the time of war when He was talking about
Dharma, He did not mention the word Kundalini

15:40.130 --> 15:44.390
doesn’t mean that there was no device behind
it.

15:44.390 --> 15:51.760
Mark said that we would like to have a country
without State.

15:51.760 --> 15:52.760
How?

15:52.760 --> 15:54.970
How will you have?

15:54.970 --> 16:01.920
I’ve been to most of the Communist countries
I think the state is very powerful.

16:01.920 --> 16:08.220
The democrat said that we would like to have
a free nation.

16:08.220 --> 16:09.220
Free?

16:09.220 --> 16:10.220
Abandonment.

16:10.220 --> 16:15.500
It is demonacracy they are practicing.

16:15.500 --> 16:20.900
If you want to deceive yourself and all the
time, accept something that is falsehood nobody

16:20.900 --> 16:22.460
can help you.

16:22.460 --> 16:30.450
But the time is precarious and is important
that we should see to the truth that the name

16:30.450 --> 16:37.410
of democracy and the name of communism and
the name of capitalism is just a myth.

16:37.410 --> 16:42.750
It has not given what it had promised.

16:42.750 --> 16:56.560
So let us come back to the Saints – to the
deeper people, to the people who understood

16:56.560 --> 16:59.750
life beyond life.

16:59.750 --> 17:10.079
There we find the urdvagati, has to be, the
ascent has to be achieved.

17:10.079 --> 17:15.360
How, is the point?

17:15.360 --> 17:24.779
Then later on Mohammad Saab also has talked
about it, not that He has not talked; He’s

17:24.779 --> 17:27.249
talked about the Resurrection.

17:27.249 --> 17:30.759
He said that at the time of Resurrection your
hands will speak.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.220
Who’s bothered about that?

17:32.220 --> 17:36.529
The whole Namaz is nothing but Kundalini raising.

17:36.529 --> 17:43.669
But it leads to another kind of stupid fanaticism.

17:43.669 --> 17:45.669
Christians are sophisticated fanatics.

17:45.669 --> 17:48.700
Hindus are another type of fanatics.

17:48.700 --> 17:55.279
Everybody is become a fanatic because it’s
all a dead flower.

17:55.279 --> 17:59.629
All these flowers grew on one tree of life.

17:59.629 --> 18:07.309
They’ve been extracted, taken over as mine,
mine, mine and they are all fighting about

18:07.309 --> 18:08.990
it.

18:08.990 --> 18:20.710
So it’s only the Kundalini awakening which
is going to give you your Self-Realization

18:20.710 --> 18:34.279
and this Self-Realization is going to let
you know that you are a part and parcel of

18:34.279 --> 18:35.330
the whole.

18:35.330 --> 18:38.559
It’s not just a mental conception.

18:38.559 --> 18:41.779
This is the point we miss every time.

18:41.779 --> 18:50.769
All these democracies and capitalism and all
these theories are mental projections of human

18:50.769 --> 18:51.769
beings.

18:51.769 --> 19:01.730
All these mental projections are nothing but
your own jails, your own bondages into which

19:01.730 --> 19:03.539
you are caught up.

19:03.539 --> 19:08.299
You have to get out of it.

19:08.299 --> 19:16.370
Even to such an extent that people start saying
that Adishankaracharya did not write Saundarya

19:16.370 --> 19:17.370
Lahiri.

19:17.370 --> 19:20.200
Who says that?

19:20.200 --> 19:22.129
Intellectuals again.

19:22.129 --> 19:24.059
What makes them think that he did not write?

19:24.059 --> 19:27.090
They have explanations for everything.

19:27.090 --> 19:34.529
But he did, which we can prove after Self-Realization.

19:34.529 --> 19:41.820
How all the essence of all the religions are
so much one can be proved only after Self-Realization

19:41.820 --> 19:45.870
and not through discussions.

19:45.870 --> 19:55.670
Because Self – the Spirit, is the absolute
and is the collective being, that is not the

19:55.670 --> 19:57.360
awakened within us.

19:57.360 --> 20:00.879
One may say that why Buddha did not talk of
God?

20:00.879 --> 20:05.929
Because he knew human beings very well and
he said, “No use talking about God, better

20:05.929 --> 20:08.250
talk about Self-Realization”.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.580
Same with Mahavira.

20:10.580 --> 20:15.139
But what are the Buddhists and Mahaviris doing?

20:15.139 --> 20:17.289
God alone knows.

20:17.289 --> 20:19.450
Where are they?

20:19.450 --> 20:29.350
But today is the time as described in the
Puranas many, many seekers are born on Earth.

20:29.350 --> 20:35.059
A special time is a time of real blossom.

20:35.059 --> 20:39.490
Maybe in the olden day there were only one
or two flowers like Nachiketa.

20:39.490 --> 20:47.200
But today is the time when thousands are there
just to become the fruit.

20:47.200 --> 20:57.140
But unfortunately a market has been opened
out where the seekers go and get lost.

20:57.140 --> 21:02.210
Get lost into the convictions and the ideas
of some other person which is gone into their

21:02.210 --> 21:04.340
heads and they just finish off there.

21:04.340 --> 21:09.860
Their seeking finishes off there, they end
up as sick or obstinate people.

21:09.860 --> 21:15.169
They do not want to go any further.

21:15.169 --> 21:25.200
Shri Krishna is to be understood in Sahaja
style.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.860
Leela – He was Leeladhara.

21:28.860 --> 21:37.890
In the Sahaja Yoga we believe that on the
left hand side, the left sympathetic nervous

21:37.890 --> 21:46.000
system is represented by the ‘Ida Nadi’
– which we call as also the ‘Chandra Nadi’

21:46.000 --> 21:53.399
and the right hand side it is represented
by the ‘Pingala Nadi’ – the right sympathetic.

21:53.399 --> 22:01.840
The left we use when we desire.

22:01.840 --> 22:05.970
The right we use when we act.

22:05.970 --> 22:13.119
The left is the ‘bhakti marga’ [path of
devotion] and the right is the ‘karma marga’

22:13.119 --> 22:18.970
[path of action] that they used for doing
all kinds of yagnas and all that.

22:18.970 --> 22:30.150
The central part of ascent is the ‘Sushumna’
is the path of dharma.

22:30.150 --> 22:38.602
‘Dharaiti Sa dharma’ – means the one
that is your sustenance is the Dharma.

22:38.602 --> 22:46.610
It’s not an outside concept but an innate
nature of human beings is the dharma.

22:46.610 --> 22:51.730
This dharma we have achieved through evolutionary
process, as you know ‘matsya rupa’ and

22:51.730 --> 22:53.340
other things took place.

22:53.340 --> 22:56.530
And afterwards we are today human beings.

22:56.530 --> 22:58.390
But why?

22:58.390 --> 23:04.669
Let us ask a question, simple question to
ourselves ‘why are we here on this Earth?

23:04.669 --> 23:07.259
To seek what?

23:07.259 --> 23:12.259
To seek the truth and what is the truth?’

23:12.259 --> 23:18.919
The truth is that you are the Spirit.

23:18.919 --> 23:28.840
Not this bhakti, not this karma.

23:28.840 --> 23:33.269
But you are the Spirit.

23:33.269 --> 23:40.100
Now Shri Krishna’s diplomacy can be seen
very clearly, if you want to see even, even

23:40.100 --> 23:41.139
without Self-Realization.

23:41.139 --> 23:47.340
He says for bhakti [devotion] – “patram”
[leaf], “pushpam” [flower], “phalam”

23:47.340 --> 23:49.200
[fruit], “toyam” [water].

23:49.200 --> 23:53.129
All these things you give it to Him, He’ll
accept.

23:53.129 --> 24:01.360
But see the diplomacy on one word He has played
the whole people and nobody has seen the point.

24:01.360 --> 24:04.279
What does He say?

24:04.279 --> 24:08.619
He says that you have to do ‘ananya bhakti’.

24:08.619 --> 24:13.000
‘Ananya’ shabda [word] itself means, the
word itself means when there is not the other;

24:13.000 --> 24:14.639
means you are a realized soul.

24:14.639 --> 24:20.220
Logically let us see what does it mean?

24:20.220 --> 24:25.919
If there is no connection with God whom are
you praying to?

24:25.919 --> 24:28.840
The connection has to be established.

24:28.840 --> 24:34.570
You may go on describing God as a myth, you
may go on supporting Him doing anything you

24:34.570 --> 24:35.570
like.

24:35.570 --> 24:45.080
But you have not yet been connected with Him
what are you talking?

24:45.080 --> 24:47.899
Something in the air.

24:47.899 --> 24:51.159
‘Ananya bhakti’.

24:51.159 --> 24:54.000
Now about karma, see the diplomacy.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.429
If you keep your mind open as a scientist
you’ll see My point clearly.

24:58.429 --> 25:11.070
For that He says that do your karmas but put
the fruit of your doing at the Lotus Feet

25:11.070 --> 25:12.260
of the Lord.

25:12.260 --> 25:20.539
This is the absurd condition; is not possible,
cannot be done.

25:20.539 --> 25:22.759
Before Realization you cannot do this.

25:22.759 --> 25:27.870
Many people come to Me, “Yes Mother You
know whatever we are doing, we are putting

25:27.870 --> 25:33.379
at the Lotus Feet of the God” – black
marketing, everything.

25:33.379 --> 25:37.600
What does that mean?

25:37.600 --> 25:44.279
That you put it at the Lotus Feet of the Lord,
that you are no more there.

25:44.279 --> 25:54.299
It’s only after Realization you realize,
that a Sahaja Yogi would tell you, he doesn’t

25:54.299 --> 26:00.679
say, “I give him Realization”, he doesn’t
say that, “I am moving his Kundalini.

26:00.679 --> 26:05.669
” What he says, “It is not moving, It
is not coming up.

26:05.669 --> 26:06.669
”

26:06.669 --> 26:12.600
There was a lady who traveled with Me to America
once and her son came all the way from Honalulu,

26:12.600 --> 26:16.389
a very rich man and all those things.

26:16.389 --> 26:18.200
So he could not get his Realization.

26:18.200 --> 26:23.609
So she came to Me and said, “Mother, give
him the Realization.

26:23.609 --> 26:24.609
”

26:24.609 --> 26:25.609
I said, “You give him.

26:25.609 --> 26:26.609
”

26:26.609 --> 26:27.609
She said, “No, no, no I cannot give him.

26:27.609 --> 26:28.609
”

26:28.609 --> 26:29.610
So I said, “I can’t give him either, the
Kundalini doesn’t move what to do?

26:29.610 --> 26:34.169
Then give him a false certificate you are
a realized soul.

26:34.169 --> 26:38.700
He can say ‘born again’ or sort of a nonsense
he can go about, talking about.

26:38.700 --> 26:39.700
”

26:39.700 --> 26:44.139
She said, “No, no how can you give such
a false certificate?”

26:44.139 --> 26:45.139
I said, “That’s it.

26:45.139 --> 26:52.570
If the Kundalini has not risen if it is not
broken the Brahmarandra we cannot even say

26:52.570 --> 26:56.770
it is awakened, leave alone calling him a
Sahaja Yogi.

26:56.770 --> 26:57.770
”

26:57.770 --> 26:58.770
She agreed there.

26:58.770 --> 27:02.100
You cannot give a false certificate about
it.

27:02.100 --> 27:07.019
That’s what happens when you do your karmas.

27:07.019 --> 27:09.320
You don’t say that you are doing it.

27:09.320 --> 27:14.509
It’s done ‘it’ in the third; like small
children always talk like that.

27:14.509 --> 27:18.289
“Mother this boy Munna wont listen, is a
bad one.

27:18.289 --> 27:22.642
” In the third person they talk so many
times you must’ve seen.

27:22.642 --> 27:31.399
In the same way a realized soul always talks
in the third person.

27:31.399 --> 27:37.119
That’s the different world in which they
have lived and they have been very, very few

27:37.119 --> 27:46.450
tortured, and never understood by the people
who were ruling or the people who were the

27:46.450 --> 27:51.190
intellectuals or whose who were the priests.

27:51.190 --> 27:57.130
And the public was helplessly watching all
their tortures.

27:57.130 --> 28:02.860
In Maharashtra we have a great saint called
Namdev.

28:02.860 --> 28:13.139
Very great saint – Namdeva, he was a tailor,
ordinary tailor and when this tailor went

28:13.139 --> 28:22.809
to see another saint whose name was Gorakumbhar
– is a potter.

28:22.809 --> 28:33.909
The words he says is so beautiful which you
can understand with little subtler feelings

28:33.909 --> 28:36.870
about it.

28:36.870 --> 28:43.679
He says, “Nirgunachya bheti aalo sagunashi”
– I came here to meet the nirguna – the

28:43.679 --> 28:47.769
formless and here is standing in the form.

28:47.769 --> 28:52.330
Where do you find these talks these days?

28:52.330 --> 28:58.529
If two great meet they go with swords, with
pistols.

28:58.529 --> 29:10.309
Here he goes and talks to a potter that I
came to see the ‘nirakara’, the ‘nirguna’

29:10.309 --> 29:14.059
– the formless and here it is in the form.

29:14.059 --> 29:15.710
But he was a tailor.

29:15.710 --> 29:21.249
How can be a tailor a realized soul?

29:21.249 --> 29:33.240
And when Namdeva went to Punjab Shri Nanak
Saab gave Him all the honor of a saint and

29:33.240 --> 29:40.090
told Him that He should also write some beautiful
verses because He compiled the Granth Saab

29:40.090 --> 29:49.260
out of all the realized souls poems – that
You compile the poems in Punjabi or Hindi.

29:49.260 --> 29:56.060
Namadeva, coming from such a far-fetched place
He studied Hindi and Punjabi and you’ll

29:56.060 --> 30:03.919
be amazed that half of His book, which is
so big is in Hindi or in Punjabi language.

30:03.919 --> 30:08.490
For that you need Shri Nanaka who can recognize.

30:08.490 --> 30:15.860
But today seekers run after somebody who pampers
their ego, where you can pay some money, where

30:15.860 --> 30:21.960
you can befool you by getting some Rolls Royces
or some sort of a Geeta pravachana [discourse]

30:21.960 --> 30:28.019
he gives or gives you some sort of a name
in the ear so that you become mad.

30:28.019 --> 30:35.940
This is the quality of the seekers, which
I have to face.

30:35.940 --> 30:43.129
Whatever it is, the concern is so great; whatever
is the quality today it has to happen, it

30:43.129 --> 30:44.919
has to work out.

30:44.919 --> 30:53.929
Which one now I heard to My complete surprise
that now people – the intellectuals are

30:53.929 --> 31:02.580
propounding, that the Namadeva who came from
Maharashtra was not the same as the Namadeva

31:02.580 --> 31:09.039
who was a tailor because he was not an intellectual.

31:09.039 --> 31:18.129
I am talking about the unlimited not about
the limited.

31:18.129 --> 31:25.419
Like in any one of your spacecrafts you have
different cylinders, which explode one after

31:25.419 --> 31:30.639
another and accelerate the one, which comes.

31:30.639 --> 31:37.899
First one will explode and accelerate the
second one; the second one will explode and

31:37.899 --> 31:39.919
accelerate the third one.

31:39.919 --> 31:52.960
In the same way the intellect is to be exploded
to go into the space, to jump into the space,

31:52.960 --> 32:00.999
is the most important thing that the intellect
has to leave its limitedness to the unlimited

32:00.999 --> 32:04.539
intelligence, which covers the whole universe.

32:04.539 --> 32:15.119
That is the ‘Brahma Shakti’ described,
that’s the All-Pervading Power of God, that

32:15.119 --> 32:17.509
is the power of love of God.

32:17.509 --> 32:22.150
And is such a tremendous one where Shri Krishna
Himself has said ‘Yogakshema Vahamyaham’.

32:22.150 --> 32:23.150
First He said ‘yoga’.

32:23.150 --> 32:24.739
Why did He not say ‘Kshema Yoga’?

32:24.739 --> 32:31.549
Many people ask Me in the West that how is
it in Your country there’s so much of poverty

32:31.549 --> 32:36.249
and that You talk that it’s a Yoga bhumi?

32:36.249 --> 32:41.389
Because we have not taken to yoga so far.

32:41.389 --> 32:49.519
And Kshema doesn’t mean how may pubs you
have in your village, it doesn’t mean how

32:49.519 --> 33:00.010
many drunkards move about in your village,
it means, how many saints there are in your

33:00.010 --> 33:01.010
country.

33:01.010 --> 33:05.619
Let the Yoga come up, you’ll be surprised
this great country of Bharat Bhoomi will one

33:05.619 --> 33:08.679
day show its merit to the whole world.

33:08.679 --> 33:19.419
In its reality, in its glory and in its Divinity
which resides in this country.

33:19.419 --> 33:25.179
You are great people that you are born in
this country but you don’t know, you have

33:25.179 --> 33:28.460
no idea as to where you are born?

33:28.460 --> 33:30.179
What is your heritage?

33:30.179 --> 33:38.619
There are people I’ve met very surprisingly
so

33:38.619 --> 33:52.909
stupefied by Hegle and Kant and all such people
that they believe that all these saints and

33:52.909 --> 34:02.639
all these great people including Krishna or
Rama, all of them are false.

34:02.639 --> 34:09.020
This is the height of arrogance and ignorance
both put together because they are ignorant

34:09.020 --> 34:13.030
one has to forgive them, there’s no way
out.

34:13.030 --> 34:26.260
God is the ocean of love, ocean of praise,
ocean of wisdom, ocean of this All-Pervading

34:26.260 --> 34:43.789
Power, which is so efficient, so kind, so
understanding, works out everything so well.

34:43.789 --> 34:49.640
But above all He is the ocean of forgiveness
I can tell you.

34:49.640 --> 34:55.879
I really tell you in My experience, I feel
this forgiveness is so greatly effective today

34:55.879 --> 35:00.900
otherwise I don’t think I could’ve managed
this job so well.

35:00.900 --> 35:03.630
May God bless you all.

35:03.630 --> 35:15.270
As a Mother I’ve try to explain and express
My concern.

35:15.270 --> 35:16.270
Try to understand.

35:16.270 --> 35:22.730
It is Sahaja – is born with you, ‘Sahaja’
– ‘saha’ means with, ‘ja’ – born.

35:22.730 --> 35:27.750
It’s your fundamental right as a human being
to get your Self-Realization.

35:27.750 --> 35:32.260
But if you want to deny it because you have
some convictions because you are following

35:32.260 --> 35:37.900
certain people, because you think this is
all right we don’t want to have Self-Realization.

35:37.900 --> 35:41.589
God is not going to fall at your feet.

35:41.589 --> 35:45.670
You have to ask for it.

35:45.670 --> 35:48.790
You have to knock at the door and the door
will be opened.

35:48.790 --> 35:57.990
In Sahaja Yoga we can prove today that there’s
no quarrel between Moses and Christ, there

35:57.990 --> 36:06.100
is no quarrel between Christ and Mohammad
Saab and there is no quarrel between Mohammad

36:06.100 --> 36:08.180
Saab and Shri Krishna.

36:08.180 --> 36:10.140
They are all one together.

36:10.140 --> 36:16.009
As Christ has clearly said, “Those who are
not against Me are with Me.

36:16.009 --> 36:18.460
” Who wants to see that?

36:18.460 --> 36:21.940
Who are those?

36:21.940 --> 36:29.450
Christ was not even allowed to work out for
more than three and half years.

36:29.450 --> 36:35.140
It took Me four years to give Realization
to seven English men.

36:35.140 --> 36:37.390
So you can imagine what must be His plight?

36:37.390 --> 36:42.650
Three and a half years with all the mad people
around.

36:42.650 --> 36:44.690
But not in our villages.

36:44.690 --> 36:51.700
Yesterday I went to Jaipur; first we had a
big meeting in a big sophisticated hall and

36:51.700 --> 36:55.190
all this and this, My Indian English.

36:55.190 --> 37:01.170
I was trying to explain to them and I thought
it’s all gone over their heads; nothing

37:01.170 --> 37:04.849
went inside or maybe under their feet.

37:04.849 --> 37:11.910
Then I said, “Let’s go to a place where
ordinary people live.

37:11.910 --> 37:17.170
And there I found thousands thronging together
to get their Self-Realization.

37:17.170 --> 37:23.450
They don’t want money, they don’t want
power, they don’t want anything, they don’t

37:23.450 --> 37:26.569
want any conviction, they want their Self-Realization.

37:26.569 --> 37:28.799
“Maa humko atma bodh dijiye.

37:28.799 --> 37:30.130
Humko atma gyan.

37:30.130 --> 37:38.080
” They understand that ‘bodha’ doesn’t
mean lecturing, it doesn’t mean, it means

37:38.080 --> 37:43.230
on your central nervous system you have to
feel the All-Pervading Power – that is ‘bodha’,

37:43.230 --> 37:45.920
that is the “vidh” which is described
in the Vedas.

37:45.920 --> 37:51.299
They understand; they live with the life,
they are natural people.

37:51.299 --> 37:54.849
They know all this talking is on and on and
on.

37:54.849 --> 38:00.660
They know something has to happen and the
second thing they said was so encouraging

38:00.660 --> 38:05.200
– “Ke Maa parivartan hona chahiye ham
mein” – we should be transformed.

38:05.200 --> 38:09.550
It’s not our mental idea that we have become
some great yogi, this, that.

38:09.550 --> 38:10.819
We should be transformed.

38:10.819 --> 38:16.910
I said, “Not only transformed but you’ll
have your powers as realized souls”.

38:16.910 --> 38:25.600
By God’s grace even in Delhi, which is supposed
to be the most sophisticated place where after

38:25.600 --> 38:32.640
English left we became merry more, much more
westernized; when they were here we were better

38:32.640 --> 38:33.640
off.

38:33.640 --> 38:45.470
And in this place also I find there are so
many great Sahaja Yogis who are now completely

38:45.470 --> 38:54.339
endowed with the power of Realization, of
curing, of doing all the things that can be

38:54.339 --> 38:59.309
done as a yogi.

38:59.309 --> 39:04.480
I hope today all of you will get your Realization,
but you have to establish yourself.

39:04.480 --> 39:15.330
It’s just a wee bit of your Kundalini, I
should say like a hair comes out through the

39:15.330 --> 39:23.140
Brahma Nadi, but with humility, abhyase [practice],
for few days you establish yourself.

39:23.140 --> 39:31.060
Of course today you might get your ‘nirvichar
samadhi’ [thoughtless awareness] just like

39:31.060 --> 39:32.280
that, maybe.

39:32.280 --> 39:36.460
But you’ll have to establish your ‘nirvikalpa’
[doubtless awareness].

39:36.460 --> 39:41.609
You must give some time to yourself and some
respect to your Self-Realization and to yourself

39:41.609 --> 39:42.609
[pratigya?

39:42.609 --> 39:43.609
– It’s not pratigya but can’t make out
the word said by Shri Mataji].

39:43.609 --> 39:43.613
May God bless you.
