00:00.000 --> 00:01.268
8o Dia do Navaratri, Mumbai, India, 1979-0929

00:01.468 --> 00:05.855
Shri Vijay Merchant, Mr. Rakure,

00:06.055 --> 00:12.010
all the Sahaja Yogis who have come here

00:12.210 --> 00:15.032
to express their love for Me

00:15.232 --> 00:21.955
and all the rest of the people who are in the search of truth.

00:22.156 --> 00:28.757
It was really a very gracious of Shri Merchant to come

00:28.958 --> 00:34.192
and inaugurate this book.

00:34.393 --> 00:37.714
I have been from My childhood watching his cricket.

00:37.914 --> 00:41.500
I must say I’m quite a big cricket fan Myself.

00:41.700 --> 00:45.611
I think cricket is the game which is really Sahaja,

00:45.811 --> 00:51.946
between one extreme of football and
another boring game of golf.

00:52.146 --> 00:56.394
And I always have been appreciating the way he has been

00:56.594 --> 01:00.490
managing our teams and has been such a good captain to our country

01:00.690 --> 01:04.600
and I’ve been admiring him,
the way he has been able to handle

01:04.800 --> 01:07.121
the glory in the field of cricket.

01:07.321 --> 01:10.217
Even after that, instead of wasting his life like

01:10.418 --> 01:14.100
all other successful people of this life in retirement,

01:14.300 --> 01:17.448
he’s doing such a great work, and such a feeling he has

01:17.649 --> 01:21.522
for all the downtrodden and the poor people of this country

01:21.722 --> 01:25.817
shows that he is a very sensitive personality.

01:26.017 --> 01:32.599
I’m very thankful to him the way he is being kind to all of us

01:32.800 --> 01:38.691
and have been here and spoke to us about his own work.

01:38.891 --> 01:42.479
I agree with him entirely that the downtrodden

01:42.679 --> 01:47.248
or the ones who are not so well off as we are

01:47.449 --> 01:51.605
or, we can say, the one who is not such a good batsman,

01:51.805 --> 01:55.751
the weaker one, has to be helped and sustained by the stronger one.

01:55.951 --> 02:00.091
This is exactly what we are doing in Sahaja Yoga.

02:00.291 --> 02:02.932
What we are doing in Sahaja Yoga is that

02:03.132 --> 02:06.074
we are reaching to the roots of poverty.

02:06.274 --> 02:09.911
We are not just trying to do the, do the patchwork of

02:10.111 --> 02:14.537
just improving the material conditions of people.

02:14.737 --> 02:17.054
Because you have seen in the world people there

02:17.254 --> 02:20.966
have been very affluent in the countries like Switzerland and Sweden

02:21.167 --> 02:24.196
where people are very affluent and they are committing suicide.

02:24.397 --> 02:28.242
The maximum number of suicides are coming from Sweden.

02:28.442 --> 02:31.966
I’ve informed you last time that we had some people coming

02:32.167 --> 02:37.299
from Sweden and their vibrations were something like the dead bodies.

02:37.499 --> 02:41.374
We have to know the roots of our troubles first of all.

02:41.574 --> 02:45.593
If we just try to treat the symptoms, we cannot go too far.

02:45.793 --> 02:50.623
And maybe that we may cure one symptom, but may cure another symptom.

02:50.824 --> 02:55.923
I’ll give you a very simple
example of My husband’s sensitivity

02:56.124 --> 02:59.750
to his organization which is World Shipping Corporation.

02:59.951 --> 03:05.513
He is another philanthropic gentleman and he wanted to do a lot of good

03:05.714 --> 03:09.833
for the drivers who were in the organization. And he said,

03:10.034 --> 03:15.470
"Their pay is very little and the women and the men are really

03:15.671 --> 03:19.093
living in substandard conditions, we must do something about them."

03:19.294 --> 03:21.628
And so he started raising their pay.

03:21.828 --> 03:28.134
After three months or so suddenly I had a call from a lady,

03:28.335 --> 03:33.069
she said, "We are the wives of the drivers and we want to come and see You.

03:33.269 --> 03:35.503
" I said, "It’s a good idea. You all must come and see Me,"

03:35.704 --> 03:39.799
because in Shipping Corporation, I always had a very motherly role

03:40.000 --> 03:43.172
towards all the employees, and they would always come and tell Me

03:43.373 --> 03:46.578
if they thought that it would be difficult to talk to My husband.

03:46.778 --> 03:51.942
Now they came round and they told Me that, "It’s nice that he has given us lot of pay,

03:52.142 --> 03:55.791
but do our drivers know how to handle that additional money?

03:55.991 --> 03:59.186
Now they have taken to drinking, they have taken to bad women

03:59.387 --> 04:03.546
and they are not even giving us money what they were giving us."

04:03.746 --> 04:09.058
What is the basic root of poverty? It is not God, it is human beings.

04:09.324 --> 04:13.414
The human beings who have got too much ambitions,

04:13.614 --> 04:19.595
human beings who are all the time running after the mirage of money.

04:19.795 --> 04:23.326
In money-oriented societies of the West have created

04:23.527 --> 04:27.546
this kind of mentality, even in the East

04:27.747 --> 04:31.919
where people want to have everything of the world. They want to have today the house,

04:32.120 --> 04:36.133
tomorrow the car, day after tomorrow the
helicopter. Maybe they may like to have

04:36.333 --> 04:39.585
even a big jumbo jet to themselves.

04:39.786 --> 04:44.742
How do you curb this? Unless and until you bring those people

04:44.942 --> 04:50.214
who are en-massing these money too much
and extracting the money from the poor

04:50.414 --> 04:54.925
and on the other hand the poor who do not feel responsible enough

04:55.125 --> 05:00.648
to create work for themselves and not to be parasites on anyone.

05:00.848 --> 05:03.816
These two factors must to be tackled at the same time,

05:04.016 --> 05:06.912
and Sahaja Yoga is the only way you can win.

05:07.112 --> 05:10.915
Now you must have seen that in Sahaja Yoga

05:11.115 --> 05:15.600
mostly the people of about middle class people are there.

05:15.801 --> 05:17.828
Very poor people are also there;

05:18.029 --> 05:20.762
we have lots of poor people from the villages.

05:20.962 --> 05:24.094
In the Sahaja Yoga when the Kundalini rises,

05:24.294 --> 05:26.917
you get your own power within yourselves

05:27.117 --> 05:29.470
by which you feel satisfied,

05:29.670 --> 05:34.238
and this too much of hankering after money, position and all that dies out a

05:34.439 --> 05:38.215
nd such a person himself thinks of the others who are around,

05:38.416 --> 05:43.849
because on his vibrations he can feel
and he can feel the needs of others.

05:44.050 --> 05:49.424
As far the sick that are poor or sick who are the rich,

05:49.624 --> 05:55.462
even diseases like cancer and leprosy
can only be cured by Sahaja Yoga.

05:55.662 --> 05:58.457
We treat people without taking a single pie.

05:58.657 --> 06:04.323
We have cured thousands of people all over the
world without taking a single pie from them,

06:04.523 --> 06:08.935
whether they are poor, rich or anything.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.626
Mentally there are many people who are disturbed.

06:11.826 --> 06:15.676
For example, most of the money of the poor goes for drinking.

06:15.876 --> 06:20.932
They drink like fishes, they waste their energy in drinking.

06:21.132 --> 06:23.438
You might think I am talking on prohibition,

06:23.638 --> 06:26.921
but drinking is against human sustenance.

06:27.121 --> 06:29.481
Now you cannot ask people to stop drinking.

06:29.681 --> 06:32.211
It’s an impossibility. If you tell anybody

06:32.411 --> 06:35.330
that, "You stop drinking," he cannot stop.

06:35.530 --> 06:38.627
Most of the poor people so-called poor, sometimes I feel,

06:38.827 --> 06:41.666
have lots of money to waste on drinking.

06:41.866 --> 06:44.254
We must see to the other side of the poor also.

06:44.454 --> 06:48.363
By giving them more money, are we really making them responsible,

06:48.564 --> 06:53.312
are we making them better people, are we making them good citizens

06:53.512 --> 06:59.318
and are we making them one with the divine force?

06:59.519 --> 07:05.655
So supposing a poor man comes to you and he is a drinking fellow.

07:05.856 --> 07:08.297
Now you cannot tell him, "Don’t drink." " If you tell him, "Don’t drink,"

07:08.498 --> 07:11.086
he’ll hit you hard. If there are ten more,

07:11.287 --> 07:15.063
that’s more danger, and such prohibition has never worked.

07:15.263 --> 07:18.039
But you’ll be amazed to know that in the Amart Nagar district

07:18.239 --> 07:20.987
there are thousands of people who have just given up

07:21.188 --> 07:24.229
drinking just like that by getting this realization.

07:24.429 --> 07:29.126
Now what is realization? If we understand in one stroke,

07:29.326 --> 07:32.647
you will know that this is what we should have first

07:32.847 --> 07:34.881
and then other things should follow.

07:35.081 --> 07:39.710
Is that you by realization you get to know yourself.

07:39.910 --> 07:43.823
You get to know your own powers, which are again within.

07:44.024 --> 07:49.608
You get to know what are you and you get to know the absolute.

07:49.809 --> 07:53.428
As you said, is very true; without getting
to Self-realization,

07:53.629 --> 07:57.014
you will not know what is really right and what is wrong.

07:57.214 --> 07:59.146
There cannot be any absolute value

07:59.346 --> 08:01.905
because you have not yet discovered your absolute.

08:02.105 --> 08:04.828
Everything is relative, that’s why there is a confusion.

08:05.028 --> 08:07.979
But supposing you discover, supposing I say,

08:08.179 --> 08:13.915
keep it as a hypothesis, you discover your Spirit, the absolute.

08:14.116 --> 08:17.791
If you discover that then relative whatever are the problems

08:17.992 --> 08:20.900
you know through the vibrations that are flowing through you,

08:21.100 --> 08:24.439
you can make out whether it is right or wrong.

08:24.640 --> 08:28.368
If it is wrong the vibrations will stop immediately.

08:28.569 --> 08:32.678
I’ve been saying that cancer cannot be cured by anything else,

08:32.879 --> 08:36.667
but Sahaja Yoga and we have cured cancer of so many people.

08:36.867 --> 08:39.976
The other day I went to Saskar and you know there were

08:40.176 --> 08:42.580
lots of sick people around.

08:42.780 --> 08:47.023
Out of them was a blind man from the year when he was five years,

08:47.224 --> 08:50.716
and for about twenty-five years, he has been a blind person.

08:50.916 --> 08:53.732
His both the pupils were turned upside down

08:53.932 --> 08:57.121
and he could not see anything; he could only see the white retina.

08:57.321 --> 09:00.178
And he started seeing within ten minutes time.

09:00.379 --> 09:03.052
If you want to write you can write to the President’s sister

09:03.252 --> 09:05.543
and ask the secretary, Mr. Madapa.

09:05.744 --> 09:08.608
There I have also cured our President, no doubt,

09:08.808 --> 09:11.318
but apart from that there was a little girl

09:11.518 --> 09:15.351
who was the daughter of a sentry who was a Muslim gentleman.

09:15.551 --> 09:18.561
And he called and he said that, "This girl cannot see at all,

09:18.762 --> 09:21.774
Mother, and she’s a young girl of seven-eight years

09:21.974 --> 09:25.160
and she’s lost her eye sight because there was a fire."

09:25.360 --> 09:28.860
She also within five or ten minutes started seeing so clearly

09:29.061 --> 09:33.275
that she saw My husband’s suit which had white lines on it.

09:33.475 --> 09:37.647
Sahaja Yoga is the only way you can solve the troubles

09:37.848 --> 09:41.031
of the downtrodden. There’s no other way out,

09:41.231 --> 09:44.035
because unless and until you are realized

09:44.235 --> 09:48.302
you have, must have seen how these social workers react.

09:48.502 --> 09:51.737
I have also been in the social work and I have seen their reaction,

09:51.938 --> 09:54.335
how they behave, because they are imperfect.

09:54.536 --> 09:57.230
Till this instrument is put to the mains,

09:57.430 --> 10:01.692
this cannot work out properly. It is still an imperfect instrument.

10:01.893 --> 10:06.104
You must get the instrument perfected. It’s all ready.

10:06.305 --> 10:09.681
The instrument is within you; it is just to be perfected.

10:09.881 --> 10:13.262
All your diseases can be cured. Now what about poverty?

10:13.462 --> 10:16.421
Poverty, as you know is the Lakshmi tattwa.

10:16.621 --> 10:20.963
It resides in your Nabhi. The Lakshmi tattwa resides in your Nabhi

10:21.163 --> 10:24.527
and if your Nabhi chakra is cured, your Lakshmi tattwa is cured.

10:24.727 --> 10:31.158
In our country because of black magic, because of horrible gurus,

10:31.358 --> 10:36.466
because of all kinds of bad things we think about others

10:36.667 --> 10:40.787
as far as Nabhi is concerned, because of fasting, nonsensical fasting,

10:40.987 --> 10:44.694
because of going to temples and taking bad prasadas,

10:44.894 --> 10:49.624
all these things have caused the augmentation of the Nabhi chakra.

10:49.824 --> 10:52.161
Now here the Sahaja Yogis who have come

10:52.361 --> 10:57.180
have definitely gained materially. All of them have gained materially.

10:57.380 --> 11:00.412
If there is anybody can stand up and tell Me, "We have not gained."

11:00.612 --> 11:02.790
We have had very poor people coming to us.

11:02.990 --> 11:06.248
We had one gentleman coming to us from Kalwa.

11:06.448 --> 11:13.047
He told Me, "Mother, since I have joined this Sahaja Yoga,

11:13.248 --> 11:16.197
I’m very well off." I was surprised because every time, he would come

11:16.398 --> 11:20.062
from Kalwa bring Me a garland. I said, "What happened?"

11:20.263 --> 11:27.172
He said, "I don’t know, but I was walking
on the soil of my land every morning

11:27.372 --> 11:31.020
and suddenly one day a gentleman came to me and told me

11:31.220 --> 11:37.290
that, ‘Will you please sell me your this clay from your land,

11:37.490 --> 11:40.667
at such and such price?’ Because it’s a very good clay,

11:40.867 --> 11:43.713
very good for brick make.

11:43.914 --> 11:48.302
And he started paying me such a lot."
"Perhaps you do not realize, sir,

11:48.502 --> 11:52.051
that these vibrations are dynamic, are blessings of God

11:52.251 --> 11:55.787
and once you touch them, the Lakshmi tattwa improves just like that.

11:55.987 --> 11:59.631
"You don’t have to bother to look after the downtrodden or anything.

11:59.831 --> 12:03.531
Anybody, whether he is rich or whether he is poor,

12:03.731 --> 12:07.747
when he comes to Sahaja Yoga, he gets related to the whole.

12:07.947 --> 12:12.502
This sensitivity in all the people who are doing work,

12:12.703 --> 12:16.552
good work for helping the poor, becomes really enlightened.

12:16.752 --> 12:19.301
Only by touching a thing, you can cure people.

12:19.501 --> 12:21.659
By just standing there, you can stop accidents.

12:21.859 --> 12:25.273
By just thinking about it, you can manage the whole show.

12:25.473 --> 12:28.368
It is that is how, by going deeper into it,

12:28.568 --> 12:32.185
with a deeper being, that is the whole, the Viraat,

12:32.386 --> 12:34.976
you learn that you are a part of the whole.

12:35.176 --> 12:38.355
Only you have to be connected; the dynamic starts flowing in.

12:38.555 --> 12:42.465
But of course you cannot become very rich in Sahaja Yoga, neither very poor,

12:42.666 --> 12:46.179
because as in the nature, these imbalances are never there.

12:46.380 --> 12:49.362
The other day I told you, a human being grows up to, say, certain height

12:49.563 --> 12:52.129
of five, six, seven feet; that’s all, not more.

12:52.330 --> 12:55.045
Even the, say, a mango tree grows up to a certain point.

12:55.246 --> 12:58.593
The nature looks after. God looks after you. He does everything.

12:58.794 --> 13:03.582
Let us be connected only to God and He looks after this.

13:03.783 --> 13:07.195
I agree that philanthropic work is a very essential part

13:07.396 --> 13:09.367
of a country like ours.

13:09.568 --> 13:14.019
But we have to know that philanthropy is not the job of God.

13:14.220 --> 13:16.494
Human beings have created poverty.

13:16.694 --> 13:18.882
Human beings have created all these problems.

13:19.082 --> 13:22.351
So they should solve their own problems. It is not the work of God.

13:22.551 --> 13:25.369
God’s work is to bless you, to gift you.

13:25.569 --> 13:28.814
When you go to Him, when you enter into the Kingdom of God,

13:29.014 --> 13:31.841
He blesses you. Not too much, not too less,

13:32.041 --> 13:36.075
but the satisfaction and the, and the joy of owning it.

13:36.275 --> 13:38.859
Actually, we do not own anything.

13:39.059 --> 13:43.109
Whatever we own, so-called, is just a myth in our minds.

13:43.309 --> 13:48.824
Even in our poor people, we have
given them sometimes very wrong ideas,

13:49.024 --> 13:51.996
and they have formed the sort of a group thinking they are very poor

13:52.196 --> 13:56.217
and they can assert a political pressure and all sorts of things.

13:56.418 --> 14:00.712
You have to be careful that when we want to do something for the poor,

14:00.913 --> 14:07.196
let us do it from the within and not from the without. Actually, this is such a wonderful country.

14:07.397 --> 14:10.140
Here you don’t need much. You have seen Me:

14:10.341 --> 14:13.471
I can sleep on the street; I can move about anywhere I like.

14:13.671 --> 14:17.255
There is no need to have too much. That’s why Gandhiji always said

14:17.456 --> 14:23.350
that we should press on our sagara. He told all the gandhivad, Gandhi,

14:23.551 --> 14:26.406
gandhian people that you should have less. But what you find,

14:26.607 --> 14:29.985
most of the gandhivadis have the greatest amount of black money,

14:30.185 --> 14:33.852
the greatest amount of diamonds and the greatest amount of money.

14:34.052 --> 14:38.409
They might wear ordinary clothes but I have heard they are not.

14:38.609 --> 14:41.775
This heart has to be changed.

14:41.975 --> 14:46.718
Unless and until you change the heart of the people, unless and until

14:46.919 --> 14:51.106
sincerely they really feel the way you feel, not only that

14:51.307 --> 14:54.976
but they just feel it as an actual feeling within themselves.

14:55.176 --> 14:57.943
For example, if there’s a poor man standing before Me,

14:58.143 --> 15:01.004
immediately I can feel his Nabhi chakra.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.941
I can put My hand on Nabhi chakra. I can solve his problem,

15:04.141 --> 15:06.569
just like this. It’s a fact, you know that.

15:06.769 --> 15:09.578
All the Sahaja Yogis who are here, most of them are Sahaja Yogis,

15:09.779 --> 15:12.632
will say that Mataji has done.

15:12.832 --> 15:17.299
The poorest of poorest can be touched by Lakshmi tattwa

15:17.500 --> 15:20.516
and can be cured. That is the most important part,

15:20.716 --> 15:24.498
that his Lakshmi tattwa must be cured and not his money or materia.

15:24.699 --> 15:27.379
Now the difference between Lakshmi tattwa and materia,

15:27.579 --> 15:30.681
you must find out. Lakshmi tattwa is a person.

15:30.881 --> 15:34.640
He may be just an ordinary driver, but he can be like a batcha.

15:34.841 --> 15:37.228
You see, we had a driver with us for many years.

15:37.428 --> 15:40.879
He was just like a batcha and I knew that he was like a king,

15:41.079 --> 15:44.062
because he was a king in his previous life.

15:44.262 --> 15:50.360
The way he was like a batcha,

15:50.560 --> 15:54.196
that nothing would disturb him and everything would satisfy him.

15:54.396 --> 15:57.086
If you tell him that you have to wait for three hours he’ll wait.

15:57.287 --> 15:59.847
If you tell him you cannot stay here now, you can go

16:00.048 --> 16:02.937
and sleep anywhere, he’ll do. Whatever you tell him,

16:03.138 --> 16:06.973
he will not hesitate and he was such a happy personality.

16:07.173 --> 16:10.186
Now, the reason is, I would say he’s better than many rich people

16:10.387 --> 16:13.125
who cannot sleep in the night and who are all the time thinking

16:13.326 --> 16:16.524
about dirty tricks that they are going to try and many of these

16:16.725 --> 16:21.148
politicians who are just planning all the time all the dirty designs.

16:21.349 --> 16:23.537
We have to purify ourselves from within.

16:23.737 --> 16:27.720
Poverty is just a mere myth of that symptom.

16:27.920 --> 16:31.551
Now to say that people are very much tortured,

16:31.751 --> 16:36.874
I know that they are being, of course, very much put down.

16:37.074 --> 16:42.265
But what is the solution you have? If
the solution is to give them some money,

16:42.465 --> 16:45.801
or to have them money wise or to just put little cure,

16:46.001 --> 16:50.124
that is not going to help. You have to awaken their Lakshmi tattwa.

16:50.325 --> 16:54.425
I am going to the essence, to the base of it, from where the problem comes in.

16:54.626 --> 17:00.749
Lakshmi stands with one hand like this, one
hand like this and with two kamala in Her hand,

17:00.949 --> 17:06.493
and She is a woman with a very simple sari, white sari.

17:06.693 --> 17:11.039
Be sure a Lakshmi pati, a person who has got Lakshmi,

17:11.239 --> 17:16.749
the satisfaction of Lakshmi has always a way of giving.

17:16.950 --> 17:20.626
All the time he is giving. If the Lakshmi tattwa

17:20.826 --> 17:24.179
of all these so-called multi-millionaires is awakened,

17:24.379 --> 17:27.751
they will be frightened of keeping all these black money with them

17:27.951 --> 17:35.069
and extracting the blood of the poor. If the
Lakshmi tattwa of the poor is enlightened,

17:35.269 --> 17:39.117
they’ll be ashamed of begging and being parasites.

17:39.317 --> 17:43.744
No use developing parasite tendencies into them.

17:43.945 --> 17:47.892
A parasite is to be hated like leprosy.

17:48.093 --> 17:50.863
In this country we have had enough of this beggary.

17:51.064 --> 17:55.992
Our leaders also have become greatest beggars of the world.

17:56.192 --> 17:58.769
All over the world if you go, you feel so ashamed.

17:58.969 --> 18:02.718
It does not matter if half of this country is damned,

18:02.918 --> 18:07.170
because they can be born again. But live with your self-respect.

18:07.370 --> 18:11.133
This kind of beggary that is on and this kind of begging

18:11.333 --> 18:14.948
that we are doing with other countries is so shameful for us,

18:15.148 --> 18:18.395
because God has given us such a blessing of this yoga bhoomi.

18:18.596 --> 18:23.052
What a mess we have made out of it by not understanding our own values,

18:23.252 --> 18:28.241
our own culture and our own heritage that we have got from God.

18:28.449 --> 18:31.735
This is the only country in the whole world which is yoga-oriented.

18:31.993 --> 18:34.154
Do you understand the importance of this country?

18:34.354 --> 18:38.153
Not only that it is yoga-oriented but also,

18:38.354 --> 18:43.160
also it is a punya bhoomi. Here all the great saints have come and lived.

18:43.361 --> 18:47.722
Even Zoroaster whom Parsees worship is nothing but an incarnation

18:48.022 --> 18:53.852
of Datattreya, and you know how we worship him in our Sahaja Yoga,

18:54.053 --> 18:56.702
how we worship Mohamed Sahib in our Sahaja Yoga,

18:56.902 --> 18:59.064
how we understand where He stands within us.

18:59.264 --> 19:03.533
The deeper, the intercurrence of all these problems

19:03.733 --> 19:08.146
of the whole world can be solved by you people, the Indians.

19:08.347 --> 19:12.138
You are being blessed to be Indians in this country

19:12.339 --> 19:18.884
and not to feel so bad if you don’t have one helicopter or one transistor.

19:19.085 --> 19:24.391
Poverty is of the mind, I can tell you. It’s not more of eating or non-eating.

19:24.592 --> 19:28.311
If a person has a mind which is sickening, he may be the multi-millionaire

19:28.512 --> 19:32.288
still he’ll be crying, "I don’t
have this. I don’t have that."

19:32.489 --> 19:35.082
Nothing can satisfy human beings,

19:35.283 --> 19:38.201
and you know the economics law is such that,

19:38.402 --> 19:41.423
"No want is satiable in general."

19:41.624 --> 19:45.987
In particular, everything is satisfied but nobody is satisfied.

19:46.187 --> 19:51.241
With Sahaja Yoga you can give them satisfaction and self-respect.

19:51.442 --> 19:55.933
Develop their self-respect. Teach them how to come up,

19:56.133 --> 19:59.514
not to look after them as just downtrodden.

19:59.715 --> 20:05.122
I have had a very good opportunity of working for a blind school here.

20:05.322 --> 20:08.558
And the blind school people wanted to collect money and this and that and all that,

20:08.759 --> 20:12.218
and I said, "Nothing doing. You
are not to make them begging girls.

20:12.418 --> 20:15.955
They can all work out something for themselves." They started working out.

20:16.156 --> 20:20.708
Then they made some nice things

20:20.909 --> 20:24.307
and bed covers and this and that. So they said, "Now, who will
market?" I said, "You go all out to do the marketing for them."

20:24.508 --> 20:27.130
But then I told them that in Japan I was surprised

20:27.330 --> 20:29.776
that the blind were taught massage.

20:29.977 --> 20:35.829
I said, "You give them realization and let them do massage.

20:36.030 --> 20:40.791
If a realized blind person gives massaging, all these foreigners

20:40.992 --> 20:44.855
would be paying  them at least hundred rupees per massage, minimum.

20:45.056 --> 20:49.294
And if that person is blind, it’s much easier to do the massage."

20:49.494 --> 20:51.788
But the people could not accept this kind of a thing. They said,

20:51.989 --> 20:54.870
"No, no, Mataji, then, You see, You should not give them realization."

20:55.071 --> 20:59.400
Here we lack the understanding of the depth of our problem.

20:59.600 --> 21:03.180
They, they said, "Mataji, how can You give realization to these blind [too/people]?"

21:03.381 --> 21:05.553
And the blind people would have got it in no time.

21:05.754 --> 21:09.656
Only they could have been cured and they would have had this realization.

21:09.857 --> 21:13.790
But because that organization belongs to other great people

21:13.991 --> 21:17.282
of great thinking and wisdom, they would not accept such a situation

21:17.483 --> 21:22.971
where I would say, "All right, you bring all your
blind and I’ll try to give them their eyesight."

21:23.172 --> 21:25.633
They are not willing to accept this. I will tell you

21:25.833 --> 21:31.282
a very simple example that I cured a leukemia of a little boy of ten years

21:31.482 --> 21:37.193
who was a patient of blood, blood cancer patient in Delhi.

21:37.394 --> 21:40.424
Of course, we never charge a single pie. No Sahaja Yogis allow

21:40.624 --> 21:44.861
to charge a single pie for whatever he does; you know that.

21:45.061 --> 21:47.693
Not a single pie. And this boy was cured.

21:47.894 --> 21:53.330
He was brought by Doctor Mulher, and Doctor
Mulher referred Me to the medical institute.

21:53.531 --> 21:59.107
The medical institute came to Me and just see what was their proposition,

21:59.307 --> 22:02.201
"You give us the list of people whom You have cured,

22:02.402 --> 22:05.184
how You have cured, where they live and all." I said, "For what?

22:05.385 --> 22:08.216
I’m not asking for any money. Nothing is selling here.

22:08.417 --> 22:13.010
You are as if you are going into cross-examination,

22:13.210 --> 22:16.561
as if I am out here for any donation from you.

22:16.761 --> 22:19.669
You just come and see for yourselves. I don’t write the names of people

22:19.870 --> 22:23.089
whom I give food or how many morsels they have eaten.

22:23.289 --> 22:26.474
This is My love that is flowing. It’s My love that is working out.

22:26.675 --> 22:29.219
You people can’t understand love. You want Me to write down

22:29.419 --> 22:32.839
all the people I have cured. I refuse to do it.

22:33.040 --> 22:36.839
This is the way they look at a thing.

22:37.040 --> 22:41.807
They do not know the power of love. For us now, it
is necessary first to generate the power of love

22:42.008 --> 22:47.657
through Sahaja Yoga. It is very easy. Sahaja Yoga is not the blessing

22:47.857 --> 22:52.608
of one year or one yuga but of all the yugas.

22:52.809 --> 22:57.418
You have to get it. You have to get to know your Atma.

22:57.618 --> 23:02.301
You have to know your Self, and the Last Judgment is here now.

23:02.501 --> 23:06.034
There is no need to think of another Last Judgment coming in.

23:06.234 --> 23:08.625
Here, now, by knowing your Atma,

23:08.826 --> 23:11.364
you will get the power of God flowing through you,

23:11.564 --> 23:15.744
like when I put it to the mains, the power starts flowing through us.

23:15.944 --> 23:21.147
And then this power can communicate that dynamic power. What is this poverty?

23:21.348 --> 23:24.917
It’s at the Feet of that Lord.
You can just throw it away.

23:25.118 --> 23:29.497
I agree that going to temples and churches there is no God.

23:29.698 --> 23:35.045
But even going to poor will not help, I can tell you this much today,

23:35.246 --> 23:40.014
but going to the roots of poverty, by understanding why there is poverty

23:40.215 --> 23:42.712
and why human beings behave like this.

23:42.913 --> 23:46.331
You have to transform the whole thing. You are still in the flower state.

23:46.532 --> 23:50.555
You all have to become fruits. All of us have to become fruits today.

23:50.756 --> 23:55.420
If we are not fruits, we cannot solve the problem of our country

23:55.621 --> 23:59.375
and of another country. If this takes place,

23:59.575 --> 24:04.252
if this tremendous transformation takes place in our country today,

24:04.453 --> 24:09.386
then the whole world is going to be led by us, and in any case,

24:09.587 --> 24:13.056
it is going to be led, which I am sure, hundred per cent sure,

24:13.257 --> 24:15.870
that the time it’s coming when the whole world will have

24:16.071 --> 24:19.013
to listen to us on this point to solve their problems.

24:19.214 --> 24:21.569
There are countries, communist countries are there;

24:21.770 --> 24:24.545
people have everything. I’ve been to all the countries. I’ve been to Russia.

24:24.746 --> 24:28.498
Those who talk of communism should go to Russia and see for themselves.

24:28.699 --> 24:32.027
Those who talk of capitalism should go to America and see for themselves

24:32.228 --> 24:35.474
how stupid and silly and useless people they have been,

24:35.675 --> 24:40.214
how their society is finished.
Money cannot bring you happiness.

24:40.414 --> 24:45.012
If you want to make people happy, then awaken their Nabhi chakra,

24:45.212 --> 24:47.879
as they call it, or you can call it the Lakshmi tattwa.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.491
And the Lakshmi tattwa can only be awakened,

24:50.691 --> 24:53.188
only be awakened through Sahaja Yoga,

24:53.388 --> 24:55.790
by which the whole country will be transformed.

24:55.990 --> 25:02.322
Like you go to a barren garden and you see
the garden absolutely in a barren condition.

25:02.523 --> 25:07.506
Suddenly water comes in and the power of the water generates

25:07.706 --> 25:12.122
all that affluence, and suddenly you find the whole place

25:12.322 --> 25:15.415
bubbling with joy, and that’s what is going to happen

25:15.615 --> 25:19.069
to this our country, which people think as to be poor.

25:19.270 --> 25:22.504
Still I would say we may be poor outwardly because we don’t have

25:22.704 --> 25:26.934
very good clothes maybe, according to them,
and we don’t have too many plastics with us.

25:27.135 --> 25:30.544
What is their affluence? It’s nothing but plastics and rubbers.

25:30.744 --> 25:33.540
They eat plastics and they sleep on rubbers.

25:33.740 --> 25:38.407
They don’t even have so much of natural cotton with them.

25:38.607 --> 25:45.719
Our affluence is our yoga, is our power, our sustenance,

25:45.920 --> 25:50.442
our humanity, and our humanity has to be sustained.

25:50.643 --> 25:54.323
We have to have many more people like Mr. Vijay Merchant

25:54.524 --> 25:57.823
who think of the whole, of the all the people who are suffering,

25:58.024 --> 26:01.103
but philanthropy of Sahaja Yoga is different

26:01.303 --> 26:05.757
because for Me who is the other?

26:05.958 --> 26:08.751
When somebody is just a part and parcel of My being,

26:08.951 --> 26:14.059
itself my finger is paining; I’m just rubbing it and I must do it.

26:14.260 --> 26:17.455
For that I don’t have to awaken people; they just get it.

26:17.656 --> 26:19.846
You just stand near a person, you get a headache and you ask the person,

26:20.047 --> 26:21.891
"Have you got a headache?" "Yes."

26:22.092 --> 26:24.257
You rub your head and rub his head and just finish it off.

26:24.457 --> 26:32.736
You just cannot help it because the macrocosm, the Viraat,

26:32.937 --> 26:38.878
informs you when you are one with it that, "see, the other fellow is suffering."

26:39.079 --> 26:42.129
You become that. You become collectively conscious.

26:42.330 --> 26:45.118
It is not a lecture or anything but it’s a becoming

26:45.319 --> 26:47.504
within you that you start feeling on your fingers,

26:47.704 --> 26:51.023
on your fingertips, what are the centers catching,

26:51.223 --> 26:54.305
what is the problem of the other person, how to cure it, what to do it.

26:54.506 --> 26:59.506
Everything, all this knowledge is given in Sahaja Yoga, absolutely free.

26:59.706 --> 27:02.665
Out of so many who are sitting here, you can ask how many

27:02.866 --> 27:06.118
have been suffering from diseases, have been cured completely,

27:06.318 --> 27:08.898
and since they have been realized not a single pie

27:09.099 --> 27:11.595
has been given to the doctors.

27:11.795 --> 27:15.345
It is not necessary to look after your health,

27:15.545 --> 27:19.510
not necessary to do much about it. We have had people who have had

27:19.711 --> 27:22.646
three heart attacks and now they are going strong.

27:22.847 --> 27:25.624
We have had people who had leukemia, who had all kinds of diseases.

27:25.825 --> 27:28.792
Today you won’t believe they ever had that disease

27:28.993 --> 27:32.388
because now the inside is completely into balance,

27:32.589 --> 27:37.202
integrated and blessed by God’s divine power within you.

27:37.402 --> 27:40.235
This is our heritage. We have to cash on it.

27:40.436 --> 27:43.027
And by this only we are going to remove the poverty,

27:43.227 --> 27:47.789
one day you will see, and not by patching up few things.

27:47.989 --> 27:51.519
I would request Mr. Vijay Merchant and we have another

27:51.719 --> 27:55.765
great social worker with us, is Gidubai Kotak,

27:55.965 --> 27:59.106
that you should pay little more attention to our Sahaja Yoga

27:59.306 --> 28:01.571
and see the dynamics of the Sahaja Yoga.

28:01.771 --> 28:05.380
You’ll be amazed how one person, the person who spoke to you

28:05.580 --> 28:08.753
just now, was from Rahuri, these two persons.

28:08.953 --> 28:12.027
They have given realization to ten thousands people.

28:12.227 --> 28:15.261
Just go and see their houses. Just go and see their children.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.781
They are bubbling with joy, with happiness,

28:17.981 --> 28:21.104
and you do not see any poverty in their hearts at all.

28:21.304 --> 28:23.961
Their hearts have been enriched and they are doing so well.

28:24.161 --> 28:28.605
Because the energy comes within you,
the Saraswati tattwa is also enlightened

28:28.805 --> 28:34.953
and you start thinking as to what is to be
done and how to, how to make your life happy.

28:35.153 --> 28:38.248
But money is not everything; food is not everything.

28:38.449 --> 28:43.646
Unless and until you get to know your Atma, you can never be happy.

28:43.846 --> 28:46.765
So go to the roots and it’s so easy. You don’t have to pay anything,

28:46.965 --> 28:49.264
you don’t have to have many organization, nothing. It just works,

28:49.465 --> 28:55.387
just like this. So why worry and why just think of something terrible?

28:55.588 --> 28:57.872
Now more we are ahead, talk to Gidubai also

28:58.072 --> 29:02.461
that they were enamored by one guru who were showing some miracles.

29:02.662 --> 29:07.302
And I, I had met somebody from Morvi who came to see Me, and I told him

29:07.503 --> 29:10.746
that you just don’t have anything to do with this horrible fellow,

29:10.947 --> 29:16.744
because a day will come when Kalki is
at work and there will be destruction.

29:16.945 --> 29:21.275
He wouldn’t listen to Me. I went to Andhra. For your information I tell you,

29:21.476 --> 29:27.868
I went to Andhra. I told to Andhra people
that, "You don’t grow this tobacco."

29:28.069 --> 29:31.193
In Andhra there are two types of people: one who are making lots of money;

29:31.394 --> 29:35.106
the other are the so-called poor who are doing lot of black magic.

29:35.307 --> 29:38.121
I talked to both of them. I told them, "Don’t do black magic

29:38.322 --> 29:41.322
because if you do black magic Lakshmi tattwa will disappear."

29:41.523 --> 29:45.297
If the black magic comes from this side, the Lakshmi goes from the other side.

29:45.498 --> 29:47.900
And they just didn’t listen to Me. And I talked to these people

29:48.101 --> 29:53.585
who were growing tobacco. They wouldn’t listen. There are on three tapes,

29:53.786 --> 30:00.955
there is a lecture, where I said that the sea is the incarnation of Datattreya.

30:01.156 --> 30:07.069
It will take a respite, and believe Me.
And that’s what has happened with it.

30:07.270 --> 30:13.585
We have to understand that God knows all of us. He knows us in masses,

30:13.786 --> 30:17.601
and He knows where we are going and what we are doing.

30:17.802 --> 30:21.842
Your Bombay has escaped recently a very big drought.

30:22.042 --> 30:26.144
But please take heed and take to God.

30:26.344 --> 30:30.428
It is no question of going to Himalayas, of course, and no question of running away from it.

30:30.629 --> 30:36.601
But get it within yourself, try, as
many as you can bring in here,

30:36.801 --> 30:40.897
if the saints are there. Those who are Sahaja Yogis are saints.

30:41.097 --> 30:46.155
Then God definitely will bless you, definitely will bless you.

30:46.355 --> 30:50.415
And the same people who are realized today have done tremendous work

30:50.616 --> 30:55.294
in the villages. They have emancipated
so many villages without any money,

30:55.494 --> 30:58.805
without anything. When I go in the villages I’m really surprised

30:59.005 --> 31:04.818
how people get cured, how they are helped, how they get energetic,

31:05.018 --> 31:08.381
how they understand things. It’s most amazing.

31:08.581 --> 31:13.243
So the power of all the powers, that is the power of God’s Love,

31:13.443 --> 31:19.688
let us take to it. Let us take advantage of
it and leave everything in the hands of God.

31:19.889 --> 31:23.631
Only get Him into everyone you think who is suffering.

31:23.831 --> 31:27.401
You get Me hundred people who are suffering, I will see to them.

31:27.601 --> 31:30.548
Today if the whole hall was filled I would have cured all of them.

31:30.748 --> 31:32.909
You know that I have done it. It is not difficult.

31:33.109 --> 31:37.274
It is no boasting. It’s a fact. It’s a fact.

31:37.474 --> 31:41.769
It works in five minutes, for so many people can get it.

31:41.969 --> 31:46.662
But people do not want to face reality
and they do not want to attend to it.

31:46.862 --> 31:50.176
Now we have already so many Sahaja Yogis in Bombay. So you can imagine

31:50.377 --> 31:53.576
I’ve worked here for nine years. We have
some more of course in the outer centers

31:53.777 --> 31:57.623
but here in the center we have so many or little more. So you can see

31:57.824 --> 32:02.805
how people are. And the work you are doing from outside,

32:03.005 --> 32:08.232
it’s all like a blind person going doing this work, that work, that work, that work.

32:08.433 --> 32:10.877
Politicians also think they are doing great work.

32:11.078 --> 32:13.686
All right, they are doing. Social workers are also doing

32:13.887 --> 32:16.824
great work. Everybody’s doing. But there’s no coordination,

32:17.024 --> 32:21.084
there’s no integration and there’s no satisfaction of what one is doing.

32:21.285 --> 32:24.382
The reason is all of them belong to the one whole

32:24.582 --> 32:27.563
and they have not yet connected with the whole, which one has to do.

32:27.764 --> 32:30.317
We are finding our wholesomeness all over the world,

32:30.518 --> 32:32.828
whether we are Indians, Americans or anything.

32:33.028 --> 32:35.566
We are all just trying to find out our wholesomeness,

32:35.766 --> 32:40.479
and the answer is Sahaja Yoga. It is Sahaja Yoga.

32:40.680 --> 32:43.798
There’s no other answer to anyone of these problems.

32:43.998 --> 32:47.503
Today I am telling you, again you can tell Me afterwards.

32:47.703 --> 32:50.235
You give Me your problems, you tell Me who are the downtrodden.

32:50.436 --> 32:52.892
Let Me see. Let Me see who are the downtrodden.

32:53.092 --> 32:55.565
Now you, somebody wanted Me to go and see the fishermen. I said,

32:55.766 --> 32:59.519
"All right, I’ll go and see them." I’m sure if I, they get realization,

32:59.719 --> 33:03.669
their fishery will improve, definitely, hundred per cent; I’m sure of it.

33:03.870 --> 33:07.178
Everything improves because God’s blessings are there

33:07.378 --> 33:11.438
and God has got the six qualities which makes Him Bhagwan.

33:11.638 --> 33:16.312
It’s one of them is Shubha, Auspicious. Another is Kalyan.

33:16.513 --> 33:20.902
Another is Aishwary [GW: Ishwari?]. Like these the six qualities of God.

33:21.102 --> 33:23.898
These six qualities emit from the being,

33:24.098 --> 33:26.529
and once you face it, you get it.

33:26.729 --> 33:30.021
You want to do Kalyan; all right, then face people to God,

33:30.221 --> 33:32.402
and this is the way by which you can face it.

33:32.602 --> 33:35.656
You don’t have to organize churches and temples or anything.

33:35.856 --> 33:41.294
It’s just the energy which has to flow, Shakti that has to flow.

33:41.494 --> 33:45.064
Like you can see a wood is lying there, has nothing.

33:45.264 --> 33:48.709
But if you enlighten it, it gives you light, fire, everything.

33:48.909 --> 33:52.868
In the same way enlightenment is the only way to solve the problem,

33:53.068 --> 33:57.531
and all of us should try to enlighten as many people as possible.

33:57.731 --> 34:00.116
Our work, of course, is more for the middle class

34:00.316 --> 34:03.264
because the extremes do not take to us.

34:03.465 --> 34:05.487
But when the middle course increases,

34:05.687 --> 34:08.979
the river flows on both the sides. She can feed on the both the sides.

34:09.179 --> 34:11.895
Gradually the both the sides can also join [them],

34:12.095 --> 34:14.665
but the depth is in the center, in the madhya marga,

34:14.865 --> 34:17.711
and there it works out. It is only the middle class,

34:17.912 --> 34:20.822
which can work it out because they have the values necessary,

34:21.023 --> 34:24.824
they have the feelings necessary and they have the blessings necessary

34:25.025 --> 34:28.942
because they lead a very normal life. Once they learn their swimming,

34:29.143 --> 34:31.523
they must know themselves before helping others.

34:31.723 --> 34:34.380
You must help yourself, you must become yourself,

34:34.580 --> 34:37.396
before you help others. Once they achieve that,

34:37.596 --> 34:41.265
they can easy help, easy help others and that has been done.

34:41.465 --> 34:43.646
It is such a silent work of Sahaja Yoga

34:43.846 --> 34:46.044
that we have not maintain any statistics.

34:46.244 --> 34:49.114
We have not yet been able to say. Here there are people who have given

34:49.315 --> 34:53.341
realization to minimum of ten thousands or eight thousands people.

34:53.541 --> 34:55.580
There are people who have cured thousands of people

34:55.781 --> 34:57.798
who are sitting here just like ordinary people,

34:57.998 --> 35:01.670
but they don’t know about it and they’ll say, "We didn’t do, Mother.

35:01.871 --> 35:05.836
It just worked. It was just happening. It happened."

35:06.037 --> 35:08.812
So this is what is a very dynamic force. I would request

35:09.013 --> 35:13.710
all the social workers to open their eyes to this tremendous discovery

35:13.910 --> 35:17.748
that has come to our country and to see for themselves what it is like,

35:17.949 --> 35:22.913
what it means. It transforms a personality into such a dynamic web

35:23.113 --> 35:27.661
that an ordinary boy can become a great cricket player.

35:27.862 --> 35:30.770
An ordinary musician can become a great musician.

35:30.970 --> 35:36.430
An ordinarily dull boy can become a first class student.

35:36.631 --> 35:41.582
It has happened. There are many who will say it has happen in their cases.

35:41.783 --> 35:43.865
So many things have happen like this,

35:44.065 --> 35:48.250
and so we have to depend on the mercy of God for this.

35:48.450 --> 35:51.378
Only thing is we have to desire and ask for it.

35:51.579 --> 35:55.526
I think, the other day I had a talk with one of the political leaders.

35:55.727 --> 35:58.984
I said, "Politics without adhyatma has no life."

35:59.184 --> 36:03.447
In the same way I’ll say, "Social work without adhyatma has no meaning."

36:03.647 --> 36:06.638
Without adhyatma, without the Atma in it,

36:06.838 --> 36:09.695
without the Spirit of God in it, you are doing it

36:09.895 --> 36:13.756
because in you something is dying, in you something is feeling,

36:13.957 --> 36:18.445
that what is feeling in you is the part of the whole.

36:18.645 --> 36:21.620
So know the whole and you’ll be so dynamic.

36:21.820 --> 36:25.662
You’ll be so great and the whole thing will flow from you

36:25.862 --> 36:28.996
and you can really help thousands of people.

36:29.196 --> 36:33.050
I hope, it’s a good thing today we have two great social workers here

36:33.251 --> 36:36.269
and I put forward to them this kind of a proposition.

36:36.469 --> 36:39.285
So on behalf of all the Sahaja Yogis, we render all our services.

36:39.485 --> 36:41.587
Any number of downtrodden people you have got,

36:41.787 --> 36:45.090
you send them over to our centers and we’ll see to them.

36:45.291 --> 36:50.854
May God bless you all.
