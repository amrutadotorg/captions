00:00:03.774 --> 00:00:10.390
Yesterday, in the lecture, I gave a

00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:13.940
new announcement about Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:14.141 --> 00:00:18.150
But the whole lecture was in Marathi language

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:21.777
and before it is translated

00:00:21.978 --> 00:00:26.110
I would like to tell you what was my announcement.

00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:31.083
There was a question that, in America and in England,

00:00:31.284 --> 00:00:39.174
no trust which is not a religion can be registered.

00:00:39.375 --> 00:00:43.845
Of course, Sahaja Yoga is the religion, no doubt,

00:00:44.046 --> 00:00:45.462
is the universal religion,

00:00:45.663 --> 00:00:48.790
is a religion that integrates all the religion,

00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:51.886
brings all the principles of religions together

00:00:52.087 --> 00:00:57.451
and shows the - shows the oneness.

00:00:57.652 --> 00:01:00.364
It integrates all the incarnations.

00:01:00.565 --> 00:01:03.648
It integrates all the scriptures.

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:06.697
It's a very integrating great religion

00:01:06.898 --> 00:01:09.731
which we can call as the universal religion and,

00:01:09.932 --> 00:01:13.055
in Hindi, it is called as Vishwa Dharma.

00:01:13.256 --> 00:01:17.810
Now to make it more particular,

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:21.753
I thought that if you say universal religion

00:01:21.954 --> 00:01:25.789
then it may not be that particular because like the Buddhist,

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.142
then we have got people who are called

00:01:29.343 --> 00:01:31.420
after Christ as Christians

00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:35.301
and after other people according to the incarnations.

00:01:35.502 --> 00:01:38.435
So this time the incarnation being Nirmala,

00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:40.607
I thought we can call it

00:01:40.808 --> 00:01:45.631
"The Religion which is Universal, in the name of Nirmala."

00:01:45.832 --> 00:01:48.410
So to make it short, I thought we can call it

00:01:48.611 --> 00:01:52.993
"Universal Nirmala Religion". What do you say to that?

00:01:58.607 --> 00:02:03.999
Now Nirmala, you'll be all called as 'Nirmalites'.

00:02:07.218 --> 00:02:12.551
Is the one who have been enlightened by Nirmala,

00:02:12.752 --> 00:02:14.485
it goes, light shabda (word) goes,

00:02:14.686 --> 00:02:17.613
the word light goes very well with you people

00:02:17.814 --> 00:02:19.115
because you are enlightened.

00:02:19.316 --> 00:02:22.183
Others are just lights without any flame.

00:02:22.384 --> 00:02:24.358
So this is Nirmalites,

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:28.033
means the ones who are being enlightened by Nirmala.

00:02:28.234 --> 00:02:29.665
So if you like the name,

00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:33.759
we can call it 'Universal Nirmala Religion'.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.219
If that suits your people in the west,

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.102
I think that's a good name. So we have now proclaimed

00:02:41.303 --> 00:02:43.703
and pronounced that this is a religion

00:02:43.904 --> 00:02:47.373
which is a pure universal religion.

00:02:47.574 --> 00:02:49.728
When you say Universal Nirmala

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:53.957
means pure or immaculate religion.

00:02:55.192 --> 00:02:58.701
And I hope you are agreeable to that.

00:02:58.902 --> 00:03:01.042
Now, once we accept that religion,

00:03:01.243 --> 00:03:03.385
once we become universal

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:07.301
then we have to forget about our small little caste,

00:03:07.502 --> 00:03:13.521
customs, our old dead traditions

00:03:13.722 --> 00:03:20.881
and the things that are not keeping with our spirit.

00:03:21.082 --> 00:03:23.363
Whatever is comfortable to your spirit

00:03:23.564 --> 00:03:29.054
has to be accepted as the principle of our religion.

00:03:29.255 --> 00:03:32.260
And whatever is not comfortable for it,

00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:34.891
we are not going to accept.

00:03:35.092 --> 00:03:39.709
So whatever is the way I have brought you,

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.390
these are my teachings. Out of my teachings,

00:03:42.591 --> 00:03:46.603
whatever you have achieved, belongs to this religion.

00:03:46.804 --> 00:03:48.739
Of course in this religion, as you know,

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.753
all the great prophets are really respected.

00:03:51.954 --> 00:03:54.610
The best advantage of this religion is ki (that), so far,

00:03:54.811 --> 00:03:56.955
all the religions, though they were true religions,

00:03:57.156 --> 00:04:00.144
were established by true people and prophets,

00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:03.474
were all ruined by their disciples.

00:04:03.675 --> 00:04:06.955
The reason was they were not given realization, firstly,

00:04:07.156 --> 00:04:13.053
and secondly there was no proof of that religion.

00:04:13.254 --> 00:04:16.171
Now we can give them the proof of everything,

00:04:16.372 --> 00:04:20.222
of how it is doing good to your body.

00:04:20.423 --> 00:04:24.685
Once you know that you can prove it, that it does good to you,

00:04:24.886 --> 00:04:28.333
then people will take to this religion much faster

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:29.676
and they can test it.

00:04:29.877 --> 00:04:32.834
Because the word 'religion' makes people quite nervous.

00:04:33.035 --> 00:04:35.081
They think religion means you are binding

00:04:35.282 --> 00:04:39.898
and then you have to get into some sort of a

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:42.467
traditional style of living which is dead.

00:04:42.668 --> 00:04:45.961
But here our traditions are that we accept

00:04:46.162 --> 00:04:50.010
which are comfortable for our spirit and for our ascent.

00:04:50.211 --> 00:04:53.426
So that gives us the complete freedom

00:04:53.627 --> 00:04:56.913
to enjoy ourselves in the fullest way.

00:04:57.114 --> 00:05:04.288
Under these circumstances, we forget what country we come from,

00:05:04.489 --> 00:05:08.422
what caste we come from,

00:05:08.623 --> 00:05:10.898
what families we come from,

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.127
all these past things we forget and we become

00:05:14.328 --> 00:05:17.030
new blossoming lotuses

00:05:17.231 --> 00:05:21.252
spreading our beautiful fragrance all over the world.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.628
So all these old ideas

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:31.336
which are just curbing our progress should be given up.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.870
Now, I told them another thing: that

00:05:34.071 --> 00:05:37.570
we are three types of people in this world, mainly divided into,

00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:43.279
one are people who are tamasik, another people who are the rajasik,

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.872
NOW BE QUIET AND OBSERVE.

00:05:45.073 --> 00:05:49.697
and the third person is the one who is called as sattvikas.

00:05:49.898 --> 00:05:55.789
Now tamasik are people, as we say that, they take wrong things,

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.919
attach attention more to the wrong things

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.038
and then waste all their life.

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:04.561
They will say, for example, a woman,

00:06:04.762 --> 00:06:06.485
she gets attached to her son,

00:06:06.686 --> 00:06:08.607
she gets so much attached to that son

00:06:08.815 --> 00:06:11.711
that that covers all entire activities,

00:06:11.918 --> 00:06:15.682
her whole life is covered with that, which is a wrong thing.

00:06:15.883 --> 00:06:18.302
It can be anything. Like I've seen most of the Sahaja yogis

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:20.299
when they come, "Mother, please treat my sister,

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.622
please treat my father, treat my husband, my husband, ..."

00:06:23.823 --> 00:06:25.499
My husband is very common.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:31.195
So all these things are absolutely frivolous and flippant.

00:06:31.396 --> 00:06:37.671
So those people who indulge into such petty things

00:06:37.872 --> 00:06:40.042
which are wrong and waste their life

00:06:40.243 --> 00:06:43.256
are the people who are tamasikas. So that's one extreme.

00:06:43.457 --> 00:06:46.448
The goodness about it that such people are loving,

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:50.370
they're affectionate, they are kindly, they are not aggressive,

00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:54.663
but they are so much attached to their family life

00:06:54.864 --> 00:06:56.018
and family things

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:59.498
that to them it is only the family and nothing else.

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:04.206
Now these people being extremely left sided

00:07:04.407 --> 00:07:06.188
have much more children than normal.

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:09.768
That's why in India we have more children.

00:07:10.917 --> 00:07:15.104
Now the another style is the western style is called the rajasik.

00:07:15.305 --> 00:07:18.715
Now the rajasik are the people who are the ones

00:07:18.916 --> 00:07:21.990
who do not know what is right and wrong.

00:07:22.191 --> 00:07:24.860
They are, they think they are the wisest in the whole world

00:07:25.061 --> 00:07:27.836
and they said, "This is also good, that is also good."

00:07:28.037 --> 00:07:31.123
As Satan is also good, and God is also good.

00:07:31.324 --> 00:07:34.413
They go on like this, you see, as if they are very generous people,

00:07:34.614 --> 00:07:36.962
they are very kindly, trying to show off.

00:07:37.163 --> 00:07:39.581
But such people become extremely right sided.

00:07:39.782 --> 00:07:42.027
Especially their women become very right sided.

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:43.992
As soon as the women become right sided,

00:07:44.193 --> 00:07:47.121
the men loose their potency, I should say.

00:07:47.322 --> 00:07:50.242
Because the women start dominating them all the time

00:07:50.443 --> 00:07:54.666
so men become just like cabbages. You see that very clearly.

00:07:55.327 --> 00:07:57.424
And the women decide for everything,

00:07:57.625 --> 00:07:59.814
they'll sit on their heads, they'll take a decision

00:08:00.015 --> 00:08:03.065
and the men start accepting everything, "All right, all right"

00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:06.977
because they want peace at any cost.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.933
But there is nothing like "right," so they are confused.

00:08:13.134 --> 00:08:14.515
You ask anybody, "I am confused."

00:08:14.716 --> 00:08:16.390
They are not ashamed to say that also.

00:08:16.591 --> 00:08:18.433
In India if someone says, "I'm confused,"

00:08:18.634 --> 00:08:21.228
they'll say, "Go to the lunatic asylum."

00:08:21.429 --> 00:08:23.881
But, they say, "I'm confused,"

00:08:24.082 --> 00:08:27.616
because by that they try to show that I'm very aware ---

00:08:27.817 --> 00:08:29.675
because I'm confused, you see?

00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:32.229
That's not the sign. You must know the right path.

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:33.929
How are you confused?

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.531
If you don't know the right path then something wrong with your brain.

00:08:37.732 --> 00:08:39.158
And that's what happens that the people,

00:08:39.359 --> 00:08:42.582
as a result of not deciding this, not deciding that,

00:08:42.783 --> 00:08:45.340
all the time wavering, this is good, that is good,

00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:47.885
should I do this or should I not do that.

00:08:48.086 --> 00:08:50.632
They become really stupid sometimes.

00:08:50.833 --> 00:08:53.528
To them, it's alright if they have to puncture

00:08:53.729 --> 00:08:58.515
their cheeks with nails

00:08:58.716 --> 00:09:02.049
or some pins or something like that,

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.243
which you call as punks or something.

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:06.803
That's also good. It's alright.

00:09:07.004 --> 00:09:08.509
After all, "what's wrong, what's wrong?"

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.295
Let them be punks, you see?

00:09:10.496 --> 00:09:14.768
All sorts of stupid idiotic things they do.

00:09:14.969 --> 00:09:17.158
And they become such idiots, I tell you.

00:09:17.359 --> 00:09:21.208
And for them, nothing is wrong. They will aggress another person.

00:09:21.409 --> 00:09:25.076
They'll go and aggress other countries

00:09:25.277 --> 00:09:30.208
and do all kinds of dominating,

00:09:30.409 --> 00:09:34.382
aggressive acts without feeling there's anything wrong in it.

00:09:34.583 --> 00:09:38.099
I mean, they loose all their guidelines. There's no discretion.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.899
There's no guideline. And they don't know how to go.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.649
It's like a lost ship, you see.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:46.892
But still, the worst part of it is that you think, "What's wrong?"

00:09:47.093 --> 00:09:50.853
I mean, if it is not silly, it is happy going to hell directly.

00:09:51.054 --> 00:09:54.429
That sort of a mentality develops and it's very dangerous.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.026
Here, now, and naturally with this kind of right sided people,

00:09:58.227 --> 00:10:00.189
they don't produce children much.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.423
They don't produce, that's why all these western countries

00:10:03.624 --> 00:10:06.536
are on the minus side because love part is missing.

00:10:06.737 --> 00:10:10.600
To them, love is also mechanical. Love is also a sort of a thing,

00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:14.103
"Let me think then I will love." Then they will write it down,

00:10:14.304 --> 00:10:15.986
I don't know what they do for their love also,

00:10:16.187 --> 00:10:19.520
must be planning how to love.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.994
They loose all spontaneity.

00:10:22.195 --> 00:10:24.935
Being so much mechanized and thinking,

00:10:25.136 --> 00:10:28.062
they loose all the spontaneity of all the normal things

00:10:28.263 --> 00:10:30.219
and that's how they are like that.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.968
All the time they are confused, they say "Oh! Have I done right?

00:10:33.169 --> 00:10:35.176
Have I done wrong? Should I do like this?"

00:10:35.377 --> 00:10:37.272
And they cannot enjoy anything.

00:10:37.473 --> 00:10:40.477
Because even if there is something you give them to eat,

00:10:40.678 --> 00:10:44.154
then they'll think, "Is it good or bad?"

00:10:44.699 --> 00:10:47.467
Eat it! See for yourself! Your tongue will tell you.

00:10:47.668 --> 00:10:51.342
But tongue also does the same, I think, in their case.

00:10:53.051 --> 00:10:55.043
It's such a confused state they are in.

00:10:55.244 --> 00:10:58.331
They cannot enjoy their marriages, they cannot enjoy their family life,

00:10:58.532 --> 00:11:02.174
they cannot enjoy anything. They are absolutely joyless

00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:06.260
and in a pursuit of joy they do all kinds of nonsensical things

00:11:06.461 --> 00:11:10.271
which are so stupid and so idiotic and so adharmic.

00:11:10.472 --> 00:11:14.137
Still they are never joyous. They'll say, "We are very joyous."

00:11:14.338 --> 00:11:16.797
Certify!

00:11:20.054 --> 00:11:22.859
All such clowns you must have seen around.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.924
So now we don't belong to those clown stage so let us stand up

00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:31.263
and say that we know what is wrong, right and what is wrong.

00:11:31.464 --> 00:11:34.528
Don't stand wavering. If you are wavering like that

00:11:34.729 --> 00:11:37.833
then you are not a Sahaja yogi. Now stand on right path.

00:11:38.034 --> 00:11:40.953
Say that, "This is it and I'm going to do this."

00:11:41.154 --> 00:11:45.276
If you know that then you are sattvikas, then you are in the center.

00:11:45.477 --> 00:11:52.029
So you neither too much attached to your family, this, that,

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.321
neither you are too much attached to your own thinking

00:11:55.522 --> 00:11:58.311
and understanding but you are in the center

00:11:58.512 --> 00:12:02.694
where neither you think nor you worry

00:12:02.895 --> 00:12:07.375
but you stand in the center to enjoy the present moment,

00:12:07.576 --> 00:12:09.032
which is to be enjoyed.

00:12:09.233 --> 00:12:13.644
And so this is a spontaneous thing that has to come.

00:12:13.845 --> 00:12:17.473
Now there's a big cry for spontaneity in the west.

00:12:17.674 --> 00:12:22.259
How can they have spontaneity? They cannot have spontaneity,

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.807
that's why they think they pierce a little bit,

00:12:25.008 --> 00:12:28.295
some sensation is there, is good, they go in for sensation.

00:12:28.496 --> 00:12:31.610
Even in the newspapers they must have everyday some sensation

00:12:31.811 --> 00:12:35.979
because they are getting deadened with this kind of indecision.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.400
So now you decide!

00:12:38.601 --> 00:12:41.937
And the decision only can come in a person

00:12:42.138 --> 00:12:46.232
who has developed that wisdom through understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:51.552
through its Kundalini, that you have to stand in the center.

00:12:52.495 --> 00:12:54.840
Even in the case of marriage.

00:12:55.041 --> 00:12:57.538
Even if you marry them, after that,

00:12:57.739 --> 00:13:01.955
"I wonder Mother if I could carry on with her or with him."

00:13:02.156 --> 00:13:05.264
I said, "Why? Why are you wondering that?"

00:13:05.465 --> 00:13:08.806
"I think Mother ..."

00:13:09.424 --> 00:13:14.090
"Oh that's your wife! Enjoy it!"

00:13:15.106 --> 00:13:17.369
I've been busy fixing up marriages.

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:27.170
But I hope you will not neutralize all my efforts,

00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:30.416
all my trying. Because I still see some of them

00:13:30.617 --> 00:13:33.741
who are married look little miserable.

00:13:33.942 --> 00:13:37.805
Because you think, because you want them to be like this,

00:13:38.006 --> 00:13:40.530
they are what they are, try to enjoy!

00:13:40.731 --> 00:13:44.256
Now why do you want to change your wife and change your husband,

00:13:44.457 --> 00:13:47.624
change everything? You're married, that's the way she has to be.

00:13:47.825 --> 00:13:51.356
In any case, you'll be changing as you'll be growing old.

00:13:51.557 --> 00:13:54.682
So, one must understand that: "at every moment,

00:13:54.883 --> 00:13:57.202
how much I have enjoyed myself?"

00:13:57.403 --> 00:14:00.942
That's the test of a Sahaja yogi.

00:14:01.395 --> 00:14:04.419
Some people who are married must have had children before

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.125
because they've divorced.

00:14:06.326 --> 00:14:11.489
There may be some who might have had some other attachments.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.047
Forget it!

00:14:14.409 --> 00:14:15.791
Forget it.

00:14:15.992 --> 00:14:19.225
Otherwise this miserable nature is not going to go away.

00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:22.266
So forget all that is miserable,

00:14:22.467 --> 00:14:26.105
come in the center and enjoy everything.

00:14:26.306 --> 00:14:30.327
Now, for the first time I'm venturing now to have widow marriages.

00:14:30.528 --> 00:14:35.032
In India widow marriage is something was tried long time back,

00:14:35.233 --> 00:14:39.518
people tried it but still one can say that

00:14:39.719 --> 00:14:42.042
it was not so successful.

00:14:42.243 --> 00:14:44.646
Now, if you have to have a Universal Religion,

00:14:44.847 --> 00:14:47.733
you have to marry people from one place to another.

00:14:47.934 --> 00:14:50.039
You have to! That's one of the things.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.865
You, we call it roti biti, means you must eat food,

00:14:54.066 --> 00:14:58.620
in India I've seen people who won't even eat food

00:14:58.821 --> 00:15:00.873
I don't want to talk about it in India

00:15:01.074 --> 00:15:05.080
because they are so particular, when, with whom they eat the food.

00:15:05.281 --> 00:15:08.362
Their own relations also in that,

00:15:08.563 --> 00:15:10.787
if there is a little caste difference

00:15:10.988 --> 00:15:13.028
they will not eat food at their place.

00:15:13.229 --> 00:15:16.946
And with that what they have achieved is starvation.

00:15:17.147 --> 00:15:19.413
They don't mind starving.

00:15:19.614 --> 00:15:22.275
But they will not eat food at a particular caste

00:15:22.476 --> 00:15:25.681
because that's a different caste. Such stupid people live here also.

00:15:25.882 --> 00:15:28.955
So, this has to go away.

00:15:29.156 --> 00:15:31.488
Gandhiji tried, before that many people tried that

00:15:31.689 --> 00:15:32.871
you must marry outside

00:15:33.072 --> 00:15:34.725
but they didn't say marry in the foreign countries otherwise

00:15:34.926 --> 00:15:38.960
they would have been murdered ten times more.

00:15:39.213 --> 00:15:40.819
But now I'm saying,

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:43.886
it is now the Universal Religion we are talking about

00:15:44.087 --> 00:15:46.247
so we should accept these marriages

00:15:46.448 --> 00:15:51.424
and must keep the sanctity of the marriage.

00:15:54.114 --> 00:15:58.677
Now the ladies, I have to especially request you,

00:15:58.918 --> 00:16:01.387
now that you are the one who are going to mar

00:16:01.588 --> 00:16:03.722
or make Sahaja Yoga alright.

00:16:03.923 --> 00:16:08.832
If you try to dominate your husbands and overdo things,

00:16:09.033 --> 00:16:13.652
they are not going to be normal people and I don't want cabbages here.

00:16:15.564 --> 00:16:19.386
You have to become sweet,

00:16:19.587 --> 00:16:23.191
extremely sweet, nice, kindly and attentive.

00:16:23.392 --> 00:16:25.809
You see, that's how you can capture you husbands.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:31.510
You don't know how to capture. You are stupid women, I must say.

00:16:33.364 --> 00:16:36.440
You see, how we, actually my husband if you ask him he'll say,

00:16:36.641 --> 00:16:41.196
"I'm so dependent, I don't know what to do."

00:16:42.582 --> 00:16:46.966
That's what it is, absolutely dependent, 100%.

00:16:47.167 --> 00:16:50.043
And then he sometimes gets angry, "You made me dependent,

00:16:50.244 --> 00:16:54.323
now how can you leave me and go away?"

00:16:54.736 --> 00:16:59.690
But you people have funny ideas, you are not men, you are women.

00:16:59.891 --> 00:17:03.914
You are much more powerful than men are.

00:17:04.115 --> 00:17:09.257
But stupidly if you want to become less powerful then become men.

00:17:09.592 --> 00:17:13.899
So the women should try to be little simpler,

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:19.548
easier, kindly, compassionate, affectionate, let them dominate,

00:17:19.749 --> 00:17:24.042
they feel they're dominating, let them dominate.

00:17:25.152 --> 00:17:27.451
Doesn't matter. If, supposing your husband says,

00:17:27.652 --> 00:17:31.414
"Alright, I like the blue color." Alright, you buy the green

00:17:31.615 --> 00:17:35.154
say that this is blue, they'll believe you.

00:17:35.363 --> 00:17:39.299
They don't know green from the blue.

00:17:40.054 --> 00:17:41.323
You see, they don't know many things.

00:17:41.524 --> 00:17:45.397
You don't know, they don't know anything about life.

00:17:45.793 --> 00:17:48.602
The things that are important to you, they don't know,

00:17:48.803 --> 00:17:52.118
they just try to say "do this" but they don't know anything.

00:17:52.319 --> 00:17:54.497
I mean, at least our men are like that.

00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:57.055
Absolutely hopeless, they don't know anything.

00:17:57.256 --> 00:17:59.911
And if you tell them, alright, I am buying,

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:03.683
supposing we say that we want to plant a mango tree.

00:18:03.884 --> 00:18:07.761
They say, "don't have a mango tree." "Then what should I have?"

00:18:07.962 --> 00:18:10.333
"Uh no, you should have another tree,

00:18:10.534 --> 00:18:13.732
" uh, some other name they'll give you. Supposing they'll say that,

00:18:13.933 --> 00:18:19.381
"Put some, uh, we can say, coconut tree."

00:18:19.582 --> 00:18:23.744
Now you know that you cannot plant coconut tree in a particular place.

00:18:23.945 --> 00:18:26.820
But they don't know that you cannot plant coconut tree.

00:18:27.021 --> 00:18:31.838
So you say, "alright, I'll put coconut." Then you put the mango there.

00:18:32.039 --> 00:18:35.792
"What a nice coconut tree," they'll say.

00:18:38.928 --> 00:18:41.002
And when the mangos will appear, you see,

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:44.086
when the mangos will appear then they will look at them,

00:18:44.287 --> 00:18:48.439
"Oh! Our coconut tree has given mangos!

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.465
That's wonderful. Better, this is better." And then they will laugh.

00:18:56.861 --> 00:18:59.530
So you shouldn't, they are worried about bigger things

00:18:59.731 --> 00:19:05.889
like world peace, atomic bombs.

00:19:06.131 --> 00:19:08.561
You just don't worry about these big things.

00:19:08.762 --> 00:19:11.047
Let them worry about these big things, you see.

00:19:11.248 --> 00:19:14.020
And all, they will be worried about traffic lights,

00:19:14.221 --> 00:19:17.512
motor cars and all that let them worry.

00:19:17.713 --> 00:19:21.336
You worry about the things which concerns you.

00:19:21.537 --> 00:19:25.300
And you'll be surprised that this division of labor

00:19:25.501 --> 00:19:28.082
will bring more joy and more happiness.

00:19:28.283 --> 00:19:32.404
Like the nose has to smell, mouth has to eat, ears have to hear.

00:19:32.605 --> 00:19:35.646
But if somebody, that's what I've seen in the west that,

00:19:35.847 --> 00:19:37.502
everybody does everybody's work.

00:19:37.703 --> 00:19:40.527
You know, a president can be a garbage cleaner also.

00:19:40.728 --> 00:19:43.834
That is not done in India. Everybody has his own capacity.

00:19:44.035 --> 00:19:46.394
Of course nothing, no work is higher or lower,

00:19:46.595 --> 00:19:50.187
but whatever is your capacity you should do accordingly.

00:19:50.388 --> 00:19:53.381
Specially with ladies and men, this is very important.

00:19:53.582 --> 00:19:56.035
And if you have not learned how to be sweet,

00:19:56.236 --> 00:20:01.240
try to learn from some Indian women how they manage their husbands.

00:20:02.193 --> 00:20:04.979
Now, regarding the Sattvikas,

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.591
are the people who know what the right thing is.

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:12.199
They are actually the category of the seekers.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:17.429
And such seekers automatically find the truth.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:19.916
They are the people who come to the right thing.

00:20:20.117 --> 00:20:26.017
They have a special sense, a special seventh sense,

00:20:26.218 --> 00:20:28.748
that sense gives them understanding.

00:20:28.949 --> 00:20:33.030
What we call a very deep penetration and a pure intelligence

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:40.131
which gives them an understanding that this is the way it is.

00:20:40.332 --> 00:20:42.800
This is it.

00:20:43.001 --> 00:20:45.609
Of course some of them take time, because they are

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.390
left sided or right sided, to come in the center.

00:20:48.591 --> 00:20:51.641
But even if they come to the center, they may just go to the right,

00:20:51.842 --> 00:20:54.964
they may go to the left, they may little bit go like that,

00:20:55.165 --> 00:20:59.054
but these are the people who come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:59.255 --> 00:21:01.555
Those who are extremes will never come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:01.756 --> 00:21:04.319
You should not try to pull them in,

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.287
specially men on the right,

00:21:07.488 --> 00:21:13.903
women on too much on the right or too much on the left,

00:21:14.104 --> 00:21:17.573
even the men who are too much on the left, like here in Nashik,

00:21:17.774 --> 00:21:20.056
I find people are so conditioned.

00:21:20.257 --> 00:21:23.118
If you are too much conditioned then, also,

00:21:23.319 --> 00:21:25.201
you cannot come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:25.402 --> 00:21:28.149
Now all such people, even if they come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:30.440
they'll stay for a short time and go away.

00:21:30.641 --> 00:21:34.279
That's why sometimes I say that such and such marriage won't be successful.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.125
One should try to understand why Mother has said it.

00:21:37.326 --> 00:21:40.204
Because they will deliberately force that marriage on me,

00:21:40.405 --> 00:21:42.832
"Mother, no, we want to get married. We have decided."

00:21:43.033 --> 00:21:46.870
And within three days they'll come back for divorce.

00:21:47.071 --> 00:21:50.400
So one must understand why Mother has said that this won't work out.

00:21:50.601 --> 00:21:55.091
It's important, very important for us to know that

00:21:55.292 --> 00:21:59.926
there are many other things within ourselves which also work out.

00:22:00.892 --> 00:22:04.806
Now sometimes the men also can be extremely dominating

00:22:05.007 --> 00:22:09.745
that they should not - come inside, the dais is ending here.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:19.630
They should not be dominating also.

00:22:19.831 --> 00:22:22.754
I have seen that they get very dominating.

00:22:22.955 --> 00:22:25.042
Some of the men who have married Indian girls

00:22:25.243 --> 00:22:28.965
have become so dominating that I'm shocked, how did they learn it?

00:22:29.166 --> 00:22:32.091
And then try to tell the wife, "do this, do that, do that,"

00:22:32.292 --> 00:22:34.393
if she doesn't do it then they feel bad.

00:22:34.594 --> 00:22:36.638
Italians also have a habit, I have seen.

00:22:36.839 --> 00:22:40.781
They also dominate Italian women very much. And the Greeks too.

00:22:40.982 --> 00:22:43.741
Because they are suppose to be traditionalist like us, you see,

00:22:43.942 --> 00:22:47.072
Italians, Greeks and Egyptians and Indians.

00:22:47.273 --> 00:22:50.101
But Indians are the worst ...

00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:54.207
and I cannot number the rest. But they try to dominate their women.

00:22:54.408 --> 00:22:57.742
Money they will control, this they will control, that they will control,

00:22:57.943 --> 00:23:00.686
they will control the women, they can't control themselves.

00:23:00.887 --> 00:23:03.871
So, this is what one should not try to do.

00:23:04.072 --> 00:23:07.902
That when it comes to women, you must respect them.

00:23:08.103 --> 00:23:12.040
They are respectable. And if you cannot respect them,

00:23:12.241 --> 00:23:14.677
you cannot marry them and live with them.

00:23:14.878 --> 00:23:19.031
Now these people, who are very dominating, hot tempered,

00:23:19.232 --> 00:23:21.083
puzzled type of people,

00:23:21.284 --> 00:23:24.077
they actually spoil Sahaja yoginis, I've seen them.

00:23:24.278 --> 00:23:27.654
Very good Sahaj yoginis have been spoiled by such men.

00:23:27.855 --> 00:23:29.584
By marrying them, sometimes I feel:

00:23:29.785 --> 00:23:32.790
why did I marry this good girl to this horrible fellow?

00:23:32.991 --> 00:23:36.342
Because the girl, first of all, opposes such a man.

00:23:36.543 --> 00:23:40.199
She says, "Mother, I can't bear such a man. It's too much for me,

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.518
I just .. it's too much. He's too rustic.

00:23:44.719 --> 00:23:46.284
He behaves in a funny manner."

00:23:46.485 --> 00:23:50.035
And then she herself starts behaving in the same manner.

00:23:50.236 --> 00:23:53.794
Her language changes, style changes, it's something surprising!

00:23:53.995 --> 00:23:56.670
A person who is a good Sahaj yogini.

00:23:56.871 --> 00:23:59.656
Extremely good sahaj yogini and we have in London, we have in America.

00:23:59.857 --> 00:24:02.984
I've seen such girls. So I would request you that

00:24:03.185 --> 00:24:07.184
don't try to put your tempers and all those things on your wives

00:24:07.385 --> 00:24:11.176
because then they react and you will ruin their lives and their ascent,

00:24:11.377 --> 00:24:15.247
as well as yours, you have already ruined. Try to bring down.

00:24:15.448 --> 00:24:20.083
You have to be peaceful, loving, affectionate people.

00:24:20.284 --> 00:24:24.736
You have no reason to have any temper whatsoever.

00:24:26.387 --> 00:24:30.283
No temper, at all. So that is extremely important.

00:24:30.484 --> 00:24:33.491
You must remember that Krishna started with the temper.

00:24:33.692 --> 00:24:37.210
That how a person gets spoiled is through the temper.

00:24:37.411 --> 00:24:40.005
Temper not allowed. As soon as you get into temper,

00:24:40.214 --> 00:24:42.126
go and beat yourself with shoes. That's the best way

00:24:42.327 --> 00:24:44.139
or you cannot just go on beating there.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:46.952
So that no temper should be allowed to come up

00:24:47.153 --> 00:24:49.849
because this will spoil Sahaja Yoga out and out.

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:56.523
Is not allowed to have any temper whatsoever at any cost.

00:24:56.724 --> 00:24:59.902
Except when your Mother has been ..

00:25:00.103 --> 00:25:02.742
of course then I cannot stop it because it's too much to expect ..

00:25:02.943 --> 00:25:06.124
when people abuse me, say bad thing you get into temper, doesn't matter.

00:25:06.325 --> 00:25:08.878
But even then you need not answer them back. I look after them.

00:25:09.079 --> 00:25:12.047
Don't you worry.

00:25:12.398 --> 00:25:16.074
They'll have to pay for it. So don't show any temper.

00:25:16.275 --> 00:25:19.655
Of course for women it is out of question.

00:25:21.263 --> 00:25:25.712
And they should be not like matrons like Mrs. Thatcher is.

00:25:25.913 --> 00:25:28.824
Alright? Like, "Why did you not clean? Do this. Do that."

00:25:29.025 --> 00:25:31.814
They are not to say that. Not even once!

00:25:32.015 --> 00:25:33.858
You better do everything yourself.

00:25:34.059 --> 00:25:36.592
Don't tell your husband, "Do this. Do that." like a servant.

00:25:36.793 --> 00:25:41.245
Don't make them into servants. It is your job to do something.

00:25:41.446 --> 00:25:45.425
It is their pleasure to help you out. It's a fact.

00:25:45.626 --> 00:25:49.776
But you will see that that once you start doing everything

00:25:49.977 --> 00:25:53.707
then, men become your slaves.

00:25:54.438 --> 00:25:55.945
And...

00:25:56.146 --> 00:25:57.227
(automatically)

00:25:57.428 --> 00:26:00.239
Automatically he says!

00:26:01.005 --> 00:26:03.721
So because we are in a very joyful mood today.

00:26:03.922 --> 00:26:05.631
So many are getting married, you know.

00:26:05.832 --> 00:26:08.604
Just before you came I was late because I was arranging marriages.

00:26:08.805 --> 00:26:12.812
We have arranged about ten marriages within this time.

00:26:18.491 --> 00:26:22.009
So now we have to be in the center.

00:26:22.293 --> 00:26:24.206
We have to be in a joyous mood.

00:26:24.407 --> 00:26:27.321
We have to enjoy our wives and our husbands.

00:26:27.522 --> 00:26:31.832
That's the only thing that is your own, is your private,

00:26:32.033 --> 00:26:33.938
which is just something great.

00:26:34.139 --> 00:26:38.215
But don't start crying, weeping about the past. Forget the past!

00:26:38.416 --> 00:26:40.466
Don't discuss it! Don't talk! No one likes it.

00:26:40.667 --> 00:26:44.672
These all romantic nonsensical ideas, throw them out!

00:26:44.873 --> 00:26:48.593
They're all nonsensical ideas. Just start it afresh

00:26:48.794 --> 00:26:51.263
with a great idea that you are going to start

00:26:51.464 --> 00:26:54.313
a new life of understanding and joy.

00:26:54.514 --> 00:26:56.901
Doesn't matter what your mother says father says, anything.

00:26:57.102 --> 00:27:00.406
That's not important for us. I'm your father, I'm your mother,

00:27:00.607 --> 00:27:04.035
I'm your sister, whatever you may call it.

00:27:04.428 --> 00:27:09.658
And I have given you a wife. So now you cannot blame me for anything.

00:27:11.335 --> 00:27:20.298
Now, let us start afresh with this new Universal Nirmala Religion.

00:27:20.499 --> 00:27:27.429
So you are all the members of the Universal Nirmala Religion, alright?

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:30.622
All of you agree?

00:27:33.198 --> 00:27:38.230
"Bola Vishwa Dharma Nirmala Dharma ki jay"

00:27:40.182 --> 00:27:42.513
"Vishwa Nirmala Dharma" say it like this.

00:27:42.714 --> 00:27:47.000
"Vishwa Nirmala Dharma ki jay"
