1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,700
Please be seated.

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,760
He's finished it? What happened?

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,140
He's finished now?

4
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,840
[UNCLEAR] Have you finished or ...

5
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,700
I have finished. Mother, I meant that I just mentioned realization..

6
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,660
[UNCLEAR] All right, thank you.

7
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,840
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

8
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,180
Yesterday, I explained to you, that

9
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,180
this power lies within you, is your own power

10
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,320
and once it is manifested, you will know how great you are.

11
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:25,680
Just now, you are just thinking that you are an ordinary human-being

12
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,800
but once you are connected to the mains,

13
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,940
then you realize what you are. Like this instrument is

14
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:43,840
without it is connected to the mains, it has no meaning - and then you understand your meaning.

15
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,260
From human level to a higher level you have to move

16
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,200
to know what is Divinity is.

17
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:04,160
This is a happening, this is  a becoming.

18
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,160
Like a seed becomes a tree through a living process, you have to become the Spirit.

19
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:14,320
Yesterday I told you,

20
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:21,460
that I will be able to tell you today about the nature of the Spirit; What is the Spirit?

21
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:29,880
Of course, English language as you know, has it's limitations. Spirit means Atman -

22
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:38,260
the Spirit which is the reflection of God. Also spirit means alcohol,

23
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,460
also it means the spirit which is a dead thing.

24
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,700
So, we have to now know, only about the Atman, the One

25
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,760
which is the Self within ourselves.

26
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:04,020
When you are enlightened by the awakening of this power within you

27
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:12,840
then, the light of the Spirit comes into your attention

28
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,720
and then your attention becomes enlightened.

29
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,560
Through our Central Nervous System we express our attention

30
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,020
but in this nervous system

31
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,360
we have limitations. Firstly, we do not know the Absolute, the Absolute Truth -

32
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,980
we live in a relative world.

33
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:48,180
But once the Spirit shines your attention, you see everything clearly.

34
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:55,920
For example, we are all sitting here, there is light, we can see each other, we know how to relate to each other

35
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:00,260
and if we have to walk or to sit down,

36
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,380
we know where to sit because we can see everything clearly but when

37
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,240
we're not enlightened, whatever ideas we have are mostly mental or emotional

38
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:19,840
or sometimes coming from our conditioning or from our ego.

39
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:27,660
They do not relate to the Absolute and sometimes not at all to the reality.

40
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,960
So you have to reach the point where you get the Absolute knowledge.

41
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,840
Like, just now, I'm sitting before you, you all can see it - it's an Absolute knowledge, you know that I'm sitting here.

42
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:46,380
But you will not know whether

43
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,880
you should have divorce or not,

44
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,320
whether this person is suffering from some madness,

45
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,080
or the other person who call himself a guru, is a real guru or false guru - you will not know.

46
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:10,920
By reasoning you will not know, by rationality you will not know - you cannot find out about a person through rationality

47
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:18,420
so, there must be some method by which we can get the proof of what

48
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,160
is there really existing. So when the attention gets enlightened -

49
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:35,860
you have felt the other day the cool breeze on your finger-tips and you felt the cool breeze out of your fontanel bone area.

50
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,960
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, I said and the Holy Ghost is this All-Pervading power

51
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,740
which is reflected in us as this Kundalini.

52
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:55,160
So when you know the Absolute, then you can feel it on your finger-tips,

53
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,800
your own centers and centers of another person,

54
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:08,300
so that you become collectively conscious. Means your consciousness develops a new awareness

55
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:15,540
where you are collectively conscious - you know about yourself and you know about others.

56
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,080
Now you have to only know, how to correct

57
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:28,180
the centers, which you have found out to be out of place or something wrong with them or constricted.

58
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,520
If you know how to do it, then you can get cured

59
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:40,540
and you can cure other people, not on physical but also mental, emotional and spiritual level.

60
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:45,820
All this could be done, very easily, by you, once you get your Self-realization.

61
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,560
Without that you cannot do it

62
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:57,540
because you do not have the idea of the inner problem that exists.

63
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,480
Supposing there's a tree which is sick and you want to treat it.

64
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:14,380
No use treating that tree through the leaves, through the branches, through the fruits or through the flowers.

65
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,740
Best thing is to go to the roots and this is the knowledge of the roots.

66
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,540
We have the knowledge of the tree. This great civilization has grown so big

67
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,960
but it has not found out it's roots as yet. But as the tree was growing so big,

68
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:41,880
also the roots were growing inside and this is the knowledge of the roots, which one has to

69
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,180
just now, listen to it with an open mind as a hypothesis.

70
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,260
So, when these roots are within us -

71
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:57,440
is described in the Bible as the tree of life. I mean, I'm not telling something which was not described.

72
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:05,020
Also, this is said that, "I'll appear before you like tongues of flames,"

73
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,640
and that's how all these chakras look like tongues of flames, specially

74
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:16,780
the Sahastrara, the last chakra looks like beautiful flames of seven colors

75
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:25,060
and they're burning so smoothly, as if there's no heat in it but some sort of a peace.

76
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,700
All this, whatever I'm saying, has to have a proof and that proof you can only get

77
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,680
when you transcend this human awareness into your spiritual awareness.

78
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,920
So the first thing that happens to you, that you become collectively conscious.

79
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:54,860
The second thing, I told you, that you become thoughtlessly aware - to begin with - means you can remain in the present

80
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,020
without thinking. Whenever you want you can think, whenever you don't want you need not think.

81
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,220
As a result of that you become a very peaceful personality.

82
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:13,200
If there's a crisis, suddenly you jump into that position where you're thoughtlessly aware.

83
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:20,740
Like, as I told you yesterday, that if you're standing in the sea water, you're afraid of the waves

84
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,800
but if you get to the boat you can see all that. In the same way,

85
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,440
you just jump on to that state of mind -

86
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:38,260
mind is a wrong word, I should say, because you go beyond mind also - but you go into that state of being

87
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:43,420
where you just see the whole thing as a play - you become a witness.

88
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:50,860
You become a witness of the whole play and because you're outside the problem, you can solve it much better.

89
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:58,320
Also you have a Divine help by which you can solve your problems and the problems of others.

90
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:05,860
So the third thing which is very important for the Spirit, is that you know the truth.

91
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:15,380
Put ten children together who are realized souls and tie their eyes and ask somebody to face.

92
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:24,560
The children will immediately show the same finger, all of them. Supposing they show this finger, you go and ask the person,

93
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:31,600
"Have you got some trouble with your throat?" "Yes I have, I have a throat cancer but how do you know?"

94
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,480
"Because these children have told us. These children what have they told us - just the finger which was burning very badly.

95
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:46,880
So, must be the cancer or could be some serious because it's burning so badly." And they start, children will start rubbing them and clearing them.

96
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:54,780
When you know gradually through experience

97
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:01,380
that whatever you are recording on your hands is the truth,

98
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,260
then you start accepting it as the truth,

99
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:12,660
then your awareness that is human awareness goes to a new awareness called as vibratory awareness.

100
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,900
When your hands are vibrating, you're feeling this cool breeze in your hand and you can feel

101
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:27,960
your own centers and the centers of others - sometimes they burn, sometimes you get a kind of a tingling,

102
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,500
sometimes you get pins and needles or sometimes you also get little burning.

103
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,500
If it's a very horrid person, then might get a little blister for a while just to indicate - you become like a barometer.

104
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:46,060
But you don't feel bad about it because you just feel it like a barometer and you know what's the problem

105
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,540
with the other person is and also your own problem.

106
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:55,140
So, you know the truth about everything. You want to find out about anyone,

107
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:02,780
you want to know about any book, you want to know about any kind of a knowledge

108
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,840
if it is true or not - you have to just put your hands and ask, "Is this the truth?"

109
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:19,800
"Is there God?" Many people say, "We don't believe in God." I think, is very unscientific to say like that, "We don't believe in God."

110
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,180
Because you have not yet found it out. Unless and until you found out there is God or not,

111
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,780
how can you say that, "I don't believe in God," - it is great arrogance, I think.

112
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,880
So is best is, to find out. If you ask a question, "Is there God," -

113
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,220
if you are realized soul,  immediately you'll start getting tremendous vibrations.

114
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,060
That is how it works and gradually, you don't have to

115
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:52,740
see on your vibrations but you just know the truth - you just know it what is the truth.

116
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,720
Immediately as soon as you see the person, you know about him, as soon as you listen to someone, you know about him -

117
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,960
it's becomes very clear and vivid. There's no problem then how to find out

118
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:12,880
what is the truth - so you get all the proofs of it, all the proofs of it.

119
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,680
Now the third thing,

120
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:23,200
which I've told you, is the spiritual part of it.

121
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,920
Of course, you become a witness, you become absolutely peaceful

122
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:34,620
and the most important thing that you get is the joy.

123
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,060
Joy is not like happiness and unhappiness.

124
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:44,140
Unhappiness comes when your ego is hurt

125
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,440
or your conditionings are hurt, your emotions are hurt

126
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:57,000
and you feel happy when ego is pampered or your emotions are substantiated.

127
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,460
But joy is something which doesn't have this double face - joy is Absolute.

128
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,880
So, you start enjoying everything. For example, now see there's a beautiful carpet here,

129
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,200
I watch it without thinking

130
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:19,340
and whatever the artist has put the joy in it, starts pouring on My head

131
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,480
just like a soothing river Ganges, as they say

132
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,860
because I don't think about it, I'm just watching it.

133
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:37,660
Artist must have involved himself with great joy to do it in an abstract way but that all abstract,

134
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,140
just reflects on Me and starts flowing down.

135
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:52,340
This joy becomes then the main nourishing factor in your life.

136
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,960
Your family life changes, husband wife's relations change,

137
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,680
children's relations change, relation of the whole

138
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,780
sahaja yoga brotherhood comes absolutely spontaneously.

139
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:14,940
I don't have to tell you to 'Love thy neighbor' - you just love, you enjoy.

140
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,600
The first time you enjoy another personality.

141
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:26,620
For example now, they must have told you, we are working in fifty-five nations, it's more than that, I think, but still fifty-five

142
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,180
is all right to make it look all right.

143
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:36,700
These fifty-five nations have got people of different nature,

144
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,780
different temperament, different culture, different

145
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,640
uh.. races, different religions and when they meet

146
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,680
they look so beautiful, they never fight, they never argue,

147
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:04,500
they never think of jealousies, there's no hatred of any kind,

148
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:10,340
they do not value you what your skin is or what your position is

149
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,120
everyone feels that they are part and parcel of the whole

150
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,820
and enjoy each other. If there's a problem -

151
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:27,780
first when I went to Russia first, who came there you'll be surprised

152
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,340
were the Germans, just came rushing to help Me.

153
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,260
I said, "How are you here?" "Mother, don't you think, is our responsibility?"

154
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:45,380
Really, I was filled with joy and tears. I said look at these Germans and they became so gentle with them,

155
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:52,940
so gentle with the Russians that Russians were amazed how these Germans could be so gentle!

156
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:58,960
But the feeling that they had that these Russians must be brought

157
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:06,860
to reality, so that they'll have better life, like we are enjoying, they should also enjoy.

158
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,140
This joy is so great that people want to spread it.

159
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:21,540
As you know that I'm a housewife, I have children, I have grandchildren and I'm very busy otherwise also

160
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:28,720
but I can't help it, I have to travel for this joy because I cannot enjoy it Myself,

161
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,440
I must enjoy it with all of you and it's very simple that you can achieve the state

162
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,800
of your Spirit because it's very important.

163
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:47,860
This is for the emancipation for the whole world because all our problems come from us only, from human-beings.

164
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,820
Once they're transformed, you'll be amazed how things work out.

165
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,400
Also materially, I've seen, all of them are very much helped

166
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:07,800
because they become so smart, so intelligent, so compassionate, so good, that somehow or the other, everything works out.

167
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:14,420
I was asking them, "Is there anybody unemployed in sahaja yoga?"

168
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:21,280
They said, "None." In Australia, can you imagine? But in England, which is much worse,

169
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,100
there's nobody unemployed in sahaja yoga - everybody is doing very well.

170
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,880
You ask them, "How are you?" "Oh Mother, we're swimming in the ocean of joy."

171
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,920
All those complaints, all those aggressions, everything has disappeared

172
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:44,580
and they have become such beautiful people like angels, absolutely like angels

173
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:52,500
and you all are capable of becoming that. You all have those powers, just you have to get them

174
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,940
and you have to desire, you have to desire and that's how it is going to work out.

175
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:10,580
It is such a big subject and I must have given at least four to five thousand lectures, in only in English language

176
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,260
and many in other languages. So you can imagine that

177
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:22,440
this subject cannot be covered in one or two days but I'm sorry I cannot uh.. spend more time

178
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:29,460
in Melbourne or in Australia also. That's My life is but whatever it is,

179
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,900
what you have to get is your Self-realization.

180
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,160
After getting the Self-realization, though the Kundalini has

181
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:47,000
got out of your fontanel bone area, has touched the mains, everything is there, but still there's [UNCLEAR - I MEAN?] a very

182
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:53,700
small part of Kundalini is, few threads of Kundalini have done that

183
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,300
and also there are problems with your physical side or mental side, emotional side - whatever it is -

184
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,420
so it has to go back to correct you. It goes back to correct you again and again

185
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,900
so you have to only learn how to make this connection perfect and whole being to be purified.

186
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,480
Now for that you don't have to go to Himalayas or do any kind of penance, sacrifice, fasting - nothing,

187
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,040
it's not needed at all. Only thing, you have to come to the collective.

188
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:29,740
We have very simple type of collective because we don't take money or anything - you can't pay for it - it's so invaluable that you can't pay.

189
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,340
How much will you pay? How much do we pay to Mother Earth for these beautiful flowers?

190
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:38,660
You can't pay for it. So people, who are sahaja yogies,

191
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:45,960
have, somehow or the other, gathered a little money and they have a little place where they're having meditation forum - it's a humble place.

192
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,560
You should humble down and come there and join the collective.

193
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,420
Once you join the collective, you'll be amazed that you'll be cleansed automatically.

194
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:02,600
Automatically you'll be cleansed, also they'll tell you how to meditate at home.

195
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:07,120
Just try and you'll be amazed that

196
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,300
you are really glorious, you are really beautiful

197
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,660
and there is a purpose to our life. We are not born

198
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,700
just by chance - there's a very big purpose

199
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,240
and when you discover that you'll know your value and your identity.

200
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,540
So, May God bless you! I'm very happy today you're all here, we should uh..

201
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,900
now have the session for meditation by which

202
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,880
I'm sure, you all can get your realization - I have no doubts about it.

203
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:54,160
You see, I can go on talking for hours but, I think, talking is not going to help.

204
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:01,100
But some people have questions, I don't mind answering the questions.

205
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,160
But the questions should be relevant, please and should be

206
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,760
such that you really desire to have your Self-realization

207
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:20,580
because I'm not here to take anything from you, it's your own property, everything, I may just give you the key.

208
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,740
And if you ask Me any questions - of course, I'm quite an expert now because I've be doing this for the last

209
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:37,580
twenty-one years, so, I'm quite an expert but even if I answer your question, that doesn't guarantee that you'll get your realization,

210
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:44,260
doesn't guarantee - it's just a mental feat. So, what you have to think of is your Self-realization

211
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,200
that you should all get it - that is to be desired.

212
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,580
- Doesn't appear to be any questions, Shri Mataji 
- Umm? 
- There are no questions.

213
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:10,420
Are you sure? [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] All right. They're wonderful people, really.

214
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:16,960
This time I'm really meeting very beautiful people in Australia, really, I must tell you.

215
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,460
Even in Perth, there were such nice people - all of them got realization.

216
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,320
And yesterday also you saw, how everybody got realization. But now the connection

217
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,780
has to be established permanently. For that you have to give some time -

218
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,380
that's the main thing, we don't give any time to ourselves.

219
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:46,360
After all, we have these watches all the time to save the time but to save the time, to waste it.

220
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,860
We have to give little time to ourselves, to our realization

221
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,800
and morning and evening, say five minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening, if you do meditation at home, is all right.

222
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:05,980
Once a week they meet where you can go - they'll give you all the necessary information that you want, whatever you want

223
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:14,420
and you don't have to pay anything. If they ask any money, you let Me know - they will never ask.

224
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,000
[INAUDIBLE]

225
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,080
Wonderful!

226
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:43,220
So at the very outset, I have to tell you, that I respect your freedom.

227
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:51,300
Human-beings have been given freedom to choose and I cannot force on you

228
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,340
Self-realization - no, I cannot. It cannot be done.

229
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,540
So, you have to have that desire within you

230
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:06,620
and Kundalini is the power of pure desire within you because all other desires

231
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,940
are never satiable, in general.

232
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:16,120
So you have to have desire within you  that you want to have your realization.

233
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:24,420
Now the first condition is, that you have to be absolutely self-confident.

234
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,060
You shouldn't have diffidence about yourself - how can I get it,

235
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,980
how will it work it out?

236
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,900
We have so many ideas about ourselves and we start judging ourselves

237
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,020
Please don't judge yourself. Your Kundalini will judge

238
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,080
and She will tell you what is wrong with you and She will manage you.

239
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,420
She has been waiting all these years to give you this second birth - She's your mother.

240
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,580
She will find Her way and She'll manage everything. You don't have to

241
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:03,060
trouble yourself and tell yourself that this is wrong with me, that is wrong with me.

242
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:11,240
So first of all, you must have full self-confidence that we are going to get Self-realization

243
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:18,840
and that we are going to grow completely into our spiritual awareness. You have please, that self-confidence in yourself.

244
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:24,640
Whatever you might have done, forget it at this moment. You have to be in the present and here

245
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,740
you're perfectly all right and suitable for your ascent.

246
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:34,460
The another thing is that, you don't have to think you're guilty

247
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,860
This is also another, I think, like a fashion, everybody feels guilty.

248
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,780
What is there to feel guilty, what wrong have you done. After all you are human-beings. If the human-beings

249
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:52,660
make mistakes, what's wrong with that? You're not gods - if you've done mistakes, it's all right.

250
00:27:53,020 --> 00:28:00,080
Forget about it but don't feel guilty. If you feel guilty, then this center here, on the left side, catches

251
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:05,960
which is a terrible center because it gives you horrible diseases like Angina,

252
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:13,640
it gives you Spondylitis, also it gives you lethargic organs - so please, don't feel guilty.

253
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,100
I don't know how this idea came into the people who were in charge of

254
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:25,000
religion and God, that you all should feel guilty - is wrong.

255
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:32,980
Absolutely wrong that you should suffer - this is another wrong. Christ has suffered for us -

256
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,120
are we going to suffer more than Him? We don't have to suffer.

257
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:45,220
All these ideas must be that you suffer, you fast and give us the money - must be that.

258
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:52,720
I just can't understand, why to tell somebody to suffer - because God Almighty is your Father.

259
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,720
and He is the essence of fatherhood.

260
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:06,600
He's the greatest father you could think of and how can any loving father want his children to suffer?

261
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,580
Logically you must understand this -

262
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,360
why should you suffer? He's created all this beautiful world for you

263
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,420
You should not suffer at all - so the idea of suffering should go away.

264
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:27,200
It's becoming too much these days, the way people are taking to sufferings, for nothing at all.

265
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:36,160
There are so many such principles, uh.. which are being sold in the market, that you have to suffer.

266
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:41,220
And there was one in England which came to say, that you must go to Gobi desert.

267
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:48,980
And now, Gobi desert if you go, you'll get Nirvana according to them. Of course you'll die, that's the Nirvana you'll get, no doubt.

268
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,440
The simple thing is to go to Gobi desert without any water -

269
00:29:53,580 --> 00:30:00,580
within say, five, six minutes, you will die - there's nothing will be left out of you, so there's nothing to uh..

270
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:05,860
suffer but it's a straight forward march to your death, that's all.

271
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:13,100
So all these nonsensical ideas are to be given up. Nobody has to suffer,

272
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:21,080
nobody has to think that they have to fast - of course, if you want to fast for your health, [UNCLEAR] that's different - but not for God.

273
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:27,800
Is something uh... so absurd

274
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:37,980
and ridiculous to make someone suffer, to tell somebody that you're a sinner - is all absurdly very cruel also,

275
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,880
extremely cruel, while this All-Pervading power is the love of God.

276
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,340
He loves us. This is what

277
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,900
we should see in any person who talks of God or talks of religion.

278
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:01,880
That's what they all said but the religions have gone, you know where they have gone to

279
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,120
because they didn't seek the truth, they didn't seek the Spirit.

280
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:16,780
If they had deviated, they are responsible for such a thing.

281
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,080
They need not have done all this; They should have, really, found out what is reality.

282
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,600
But they were very much against people who found out

283
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,480
and tortured them, troubled them, killed them - did all kinds of things.

284
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:41,000
But now, they cannot do anything because now this All-Pervading power has become dynamic.

285
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:47,400
It looks after you, it protects, it worries about you - no one can touch you.

286
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,140
Those days are gone when saints had to suffer.

287
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,760
So just now, in short, you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself,

288
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:11,240
not to be angry with yourself or anything. Just to be very pleasantly placed that you are a human-being

289
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:19,940
and the epitome of evolution and that you have to just travel a little more to reach there.

290
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:31,760
All right. The third condition which is also another very simple one is this

291
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,540
that you have to forgive everyone.

292
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,820
As I told you the other day, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything - actually you don't do anything.

293
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,560
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

294
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:57,180
But always I've seen people say, it's very difficult to forgive. What is difficult - just to say, "I forgive everyone," - finished.

295
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:05,200
In general you forgive. Don't think of those people because by thinking about them also you play into wrong hands.

296
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:13,180
So just forgive all of them. Just try, it's very simple, just to say - it's a mantra you can call it.

297
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:20,020
"I forgive all of them, in general," just say that and you'll feel much lighter within yourself,

298
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:25,860
much better, just forgive. Why to carry this load on your head for nothing at all.

299
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,680
I hope, you'll fulfill these three conditions which are very simple. One is the self-confidence,

300
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:45,900
second is no guilt and the third one is forgiving everyone.

301
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,260
All right, so now we are placed very pleasantly towards ourselves

302
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:59,260
and we're sure we're going to get our Self-realization. We have to enter into the Kingdom of God - how can you be guilty?

303
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,520
All right, so now

304
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:16,220
there's one request is to take out your shoes because that helps you a lot to clear out your

305
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:24,160
problems by the Mother Earth. She's very kind, She's the kindest thing that you can think of.

306
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:52,760
Now, please put both the feet apart from each other

307
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,580
because the left side

308
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:03,100
is for your power of desire, ordinary desire.

309
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:10,100
Kundalini is for pure desire and the right side is for your action.

310
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,860
Now we'll tell you in the beginning, how we're going to proceed

311
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:25,880
and then you can close your eyes. I hope you're pleasantly placed towards yourself.

312
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:36,600
Now, please put your left hand towards Me, like this, on your lap, on your lap very comfortably. You don't have to do anything

313
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:43,220
uh.. which is troublesome or painful, just like this and the right hand on your heart.

314
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:50,180
Left hand on your lap and right hand on your heart.

315
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:56,620
In the heart resides the Spirit

316
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:04,980
and if this Spirit comes into your attention, then you have

317
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:12,360
the light of the Spirit and in that light you become your own guide,

318
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:21,120
you become your own master, you become your own guru. So please,

319
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:29,440
now take your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now, this is the center of

320
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:37,240
your mastery which is created by great masters for you.

321
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:49,460
Now, please take your right hand the lower portion of the abdomen on the left hand side.

322
00:36:52,340 --> 00:37:00,180
This is the center for pure knowledge. Whatever knowledge we have, is not pure knowledge

323
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,100
but this is pure knowledge because it gives you the knowledge about

324
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,920
the laws of the Divine.

325
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:14,220
It makes you capable of working it out.

326
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:22,320
This is the pure knowledge you should have. Of course, we have another kind of knowledge, as you know, is black magic, this and that

327
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,640
but this is pure knowledge of the Divine.

328
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,940
Now, you raise your right hand, in the upper portion of the abdomen again, and push it down.

329
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,840
This is the center again of, as I told you, of your mastery.

330
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:43,600
Then you put your hand on your heart where resides the Spirit.

331
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:51,940
Now you raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your face to your right.

332
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:59,700
Now this is the center, I've already told you, when it is out of gear, you get diseases like Angina -

333
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:05,980
so, don't feel guilty. Just now, I feel, all of you have this one the worst.

334
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,640
What is there to feel guilty, I don't know.

335
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:19,360
Please don't feel guilty. All right, now you have to take your right hand on your forehead across -

336
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:25,500
you can put it this way that on one side your fingers, another side your

337
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:33,740
thumb and you can press it. Now, bend your head slowly forward, as far as possible.

338
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,320
This is the center where you have to forgive everyone.

339
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:47,320
Now, please take this right hand on the back side of your head, back side of your head, on the optic lobe

340
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:51,460
and hold it tight. Now, push back your head as far as possible.

341
00:38:53,140 --> 00:39:00,300
Now, this is the center where, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

342
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:07,220
just for your own satisfaction, you have to ask for forgiveness from

343
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,400
this All-Pervading power of love.

344
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:17,360
Now, the last center is the most important. Stretch your hands, stretch your palm, push back your fingers.

345
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,520
Put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area,

346
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:29,800
which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now, put down your head as far as possible,

347
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:36,780
press it hard, by pushing out your fingers only, that's important. Now, push the scalp

348
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,200
and move it seven times clockwise, slowly, move it seven times clockwise.

349
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,880
Please put down your head, put down your head.

350
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,420
That's all is to be done, that's all. Now

351
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:10,800
again, please take out your shoes, put your feet apart from each other, please put left hand towards Me.

352
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,040
You can take out your spectacles, also if there's something

353
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:21,240
tight on your neck or on your waist, you may take it out

354
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:31,800
or say, loosen it I mean to say, if there's something, just take out the pressure, if there is any. That's all.

355
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,820
Now, please put the left hand towards Me on your lap

356
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:43,920
comfortably and the right hand on your heart.

357
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:53,260
Close the eyes, please close the eyes and don't open them till I tell you.

358
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,180
Please close the eyes, you can remove your spectacles also.

359
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:06,940
Now here, you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself,

360
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:14,940
three times in your heart - you can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji.

361
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:23,080
Now the question is, "Mother, am I the Spirit?" Ask this question three times.

362
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:45,520
Now, if you are the Spirit, you are your master.

363
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:53,980
So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, press it little hard.

364
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:59,760
Here you have to ask another fundamental question in your heart,

365
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,920
"Mother, am I my own master?"

366
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:18,120
I have already told you that I respect your freedom

367
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,340
so I cannot force

368
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,600
pure knowledge on you.

369
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:37,180
So now, take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side,

370
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:53,280
press it hard. Here you have to say, I mean you have to ask -

371
00:42:53,540 --> 00:43:00,580
because I cannot force pure knowledge on you - six times because this center has got six petals,

372
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,900
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

373
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:42,480
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising upward, so we have

374
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:47,200
to nourish the upper centers with our self-confidence.

375
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:54,220
So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, press it and here

376
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:59,500
you have to say with full confidence, ten times,

377
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:07,940
"Mother, I am my own master, Mother, I am my own master,"

378
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,660
or, "Mother, I am my own guru."

379
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:32,080
The fundamental truth about you is that you're not this body, this mind,

380
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:40,080
this ego, these conditionings, these emotions but you are pure Spirit.

381
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:47,500
So now, raise your hand on top of your heart and here

382
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:52,100
you have to say with full confidence again, twelve times,

383
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:59,240
"Mother, I am pure Spirit."

384
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,980
Twelve times, "Mother, I am pure Spirit."

385
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,240
This All-Pervading power

386
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:30,260
of love is the ocean of knowledge,

387
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:36,240
is the ocean of compassion and blisses

388
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,900
but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness

389
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:49,360
and whatever you may do - mistakes as they call them

390
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:57,920
can be easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness.

391
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,140
So now, raise your right hand

392
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:21,040
into the corner of your neck and your shoulder and put your head to your right.

393
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,400
Here you have to say with full confidence,

394
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:37,580
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all." Please say it sixteen times because this has sixteen petals.

395
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:45,840
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all." Please say it with full confidence, sixteen times.

396
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:05,000
I've already told you, whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

397
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:12,840
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands and suffer,

398
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:20,620
torture yourself, while the person who has tortured you or troubled you, is quite happy.

399
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:30,960
So please, you have to forgive all those, in general,

400
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,540
who have given you trouble.

401
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:43,240
So now, please take your right hand on top of your forehead, put it across

402
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:50,380
with fingers on one side and the thumb on the other and now, put it down your head.

403
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:56,160
Press it and put it down. Here you have to say,

404
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:00,560
not how many times but from your heart,

405
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:06,380
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

406
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:14,120
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general." This you have to say

407
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:26,420
with full confidence, with your heart, from your heart -

408
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:36,960
not how many times. It's very important because this is a very constricted

409
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:44,680
center and if you don't say this and you don't forgive all of them, Kundalini won't rise, so please,

410
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:53,200
you have to say it from your heart, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

411
00:48:56,580 --> 00:49:03,260
Now, take back your right hand on the back side of your head

412
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,580
and push back your head as far as possible.

413
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:17,780
Here again, you have to say it from your heart, not how many times, without counting your mistakes,

414
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:23,140
without feeling guilty, just for your satisfaction,

415
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:28,840
you have to say from your heart, not how many times, again I say,

416
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,660
"Oh Divine power, if I have done

417
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,120
anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

418
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:48,000
"Oh Divine power, if I have done anything wrong

419
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:52,120
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

420
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:07,880
Now, stretch your hand fully

421
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:17,540
and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area

422
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:26,320
and here you have to push back your fingers and put down your head.

423
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:34,040
Now again, I respect your freedom and I cannot force Self-realization on you.

424
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:41,640
So, you have to move your scalp with a pressure, seven times, very slowly,

425
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:47,300
saying seven times, "Mother, please give me Self-realization.

426
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:54,720
Mother, please give me Self-realization." You have to say this seven times.

427
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,940
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

428
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,560
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

429
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:10,260
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

430
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:15,620
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

431
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,240
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

432
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:29,800
Now please take down your hands, please open your eyes slowly.

433
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:36,060
Please put both the hands, like this, towards Me, little higher.

434
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:40,980
Now watch Me without thinking.

435
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:53,680
Now, put the right hand towards Me like this, and

436
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:00,620
put the left hand on top of the fontanel bone area.

437
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,780
The fontanel bone area doesn't mean that you touch it but away from it

438
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:14,000
just hold it, bend your head and just hold it and see for yourself if there's a cool or a warm

439
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:20,040
breeze like waves are coming out of your fontanel bone area.

440
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:25,840
You have to certify, please try to put it little away from your head.

441
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:32,960
Sometimes it can be quite far away so be careful, move your hand up and down and see for yourself,

442
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,520
if there's a cool or a warm breeze coming out of your head.

443
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:45,940
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, it can be warm - if you've not forgiven it would be quite warm - so please forgive even now.

444
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:54,460
Now try with the left hand. Put down your right, head again and see with your right hand,

445
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:02,480
if there's a cool breeze or a warm breeze like waves coming through your fontanel bone area.

446
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:11,880
Now again with the right hand, again put down your head and see for yourself

447
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:18,240
if there's a cool breeze or a warm breeze like waves

448
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:22,040
are coming out of your fontanel bone area.

449
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,740
Now, raise both your hands towards the sky, push back your head

450
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:39,580
and now here you have to ask one of these following questions, one of them,

451
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,220
three times, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

452
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:53,660
or, "Mother, is this the All-Pervading power of God's love?" or "Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya,

453
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:59,420
is this the Brahma Chaitanya?" Ask one of these questions three times in your heart.

454
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,440
Now please take down your hands.

455
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:18,700
You'll feel very relaxed.

456
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:27,480
All those who have felt cool or warm breeze out of their fontanel bone area

457
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:35,140
or on their finger-tips or on their hands, please raise both your hands, please raise both your hands.

458
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:44,040
[UNCLEAR] You didn't feel it? All right, let's see.

459
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:48,560
You feel it here. She's got it but she's not feeling, maybe.

460
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:56,620
