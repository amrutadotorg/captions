1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000


2
00:00:08,107 --> 00:00:14,169
It is good that all Sahaja Yogis have come together.

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:22,053
When we meet like this, we can discuss many things of mutual interest

4
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,922
and tell even small details about them to each other

5
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:31,927
how to clean yourself as your Mother’s name itself is Nirmala

6
00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:36,952
and it contains many powers.

7
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:41,151
The first word is NIH which means not.

8
00:00:41,232 --> 00:00:47,291
Something that actually does not exist but appears to exist,

9
00:00:47,397 --> 00:00:52,850
is called Mahamaya (illusion).

10
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:57,984
In fact it is not there but we feel it exists

11
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:04,200
and this is called Mahamaya and the whole world is like that.

12
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:07,981
It is seen but it is not true:

13
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:16,133
if we are trapped into it we feel that it is the only thing we have to live for.

14
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:21,454
Then we feel that economic conditions are unsatisfactory,

15
00:01:21,534 --> 00:01:27,100
social and domestic (family) conditions are bad,

16
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:33,127
everything around us is bad and we cannot see anything good.

17
00:01:33,208 --> 00:01:38,849
Water on the sea surface is very dirty and turbid.

18
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:42,711
Many objects are seen floating on it.

19
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:49,285
But if we go deep into the sea there is so much beauty, wealth and power

20
00:01:49,365 --> 00:01:54,330
that we forget that on the surface the water is so bad.

21
00:01:54,411 --> 00:02:00,235
The point is that everything that you see around is illusion.

22
00:02:00,322 --> 00:02:03,832
You must remember first of all it is all nothing.

23
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:10,534
If you have to establish ‘NIH’ you have to tell yourself,

24
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,740
whenever a thought comes, say “not this

25
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,678
(ya neti neti vachane nigamor avochus)

26
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,455
another thought comes, say it is not there.

27
00:02:24,536 --> 00:02:28,902
You have to say this again and again.

28
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:35,678
Then you will understand the meaning of word ‘NIH’.

29
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:43,940
The illusion that you see is not just the illusion,

30
00:02:45,436 --> 00:02:49,921
but there is something beyond that.

31
00:02:50,127 --> 00:02:56,270
However, we have wasted so many years of lives in these illusions

32
00:02:56,351 --> 00:03:02,650
that we give importance to all that actually does not exist

33
00:03:02,743 --> 00:03:07,436
and in doing that we have made heaps of sins.

34
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:13,047
We have tried to derive the pleasure from many things.

35
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:21,752
We have received nothing from whatever we have tried to enjoy.

36
00:03:22,965 --> 00:03:28,195
Essentially, it is all nothing – tasteless.

37
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:37,029
So, the outlook should be, it is all that nothing, it is all false.

38
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:43,770
Only Brahma is real the rest all is false.

39
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:46,815
You have to adopt this view point everywhere in life.

40
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:50,037
Then you will understand the true meaning of Sahaja Yoga.

41
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:53,935
What happens with most of the Sahaja Yogis after realisation, is that they think,

42
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:57,796
“now that we are realised we have Mataji’s blessings.

43
00:03:58,836 --> 00:04:01,922
Then why are we not prosperous?”.

44
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:08,508
That means they think God is in the prosperity.

45
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:14,961
Inspite of having our realization why our family conditions do not improve?

46
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:20,526
Instead, you should think that, inspite of the realization

47
00:04:20,654 --> 00:04:24,900
why my temperament (swabhav) has not changed.

48
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:32,247
Then you’ll realise that my swabhav has not changed.

49
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:36,801
See, how beautiful is this word ‘Swabhav’

50
00:04:36,882 --> 00:04:41,230
– ‘Swa’ is Atman i.e. the spirit and bhav is the nature.

51
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:44,142
Have you become the nature of your Self ?

52
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:47,797
If you become your self there is so much beauty within,

53
00:04:47,878 --> 00:04:53,120
that all that goes on outside would appear like drama.

54
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:58,197
So long as this witness state is not fully awakened within you,

55
00:04:58,277 --> 00:05:01,924
you have not followed the word ‘NIH’ and also you have not practised it.

56
00:05:02,005 --> 00:05:07,395
Suppose you are aware that you have not established ‘NIH’ within you

57
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:11,145
and even now you become s emotional or egoistical,

58
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:14,608
coercive or submissive and feel sad about it,

59
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:18,247
then the state of being on ‘NIH’ is at the centre of these extremes.

60
00:05:18,934 --> 00:05:21,740
You are neither in this state nor in that.

61
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,186
This state has to be established and it can be best achieved in meditation.

62
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:30,986
Just by following the idea of ‘NIH’ in your life 
you will become (Nirvichar) thoughtless.

63
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:34,240
First of all, you should become thoughtless.

64
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,757
Once you start jumping on a thought 
however good or bad it may be,

65
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,874
you go into some sort of inertia

66
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:42,715
and in that state you jump from one thought to another.

67
00:05:42,795 --> 00:05:49,511
So some people have said that a bad thought 
should be opposed by a good thought.

68
00:05:49,591 --> 00:05:55,381
In other words if a vehicle or train coming from one direction,

69
00:05:55,461 --> 00:06:00,963
is pushed back by another one, both 
will stop somewhere at the centre.

70
00:06:01,043 --> 00:06:04,831
It is good but occasionally it can become harmful.

71
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:08,958
A bad thought when put down by a good thought remains suppressed

72
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:14,011
but it can suddenly come up and it happens with many people.

73
00:06:14,092 --> 00:06:19,345
They press down their normal thoughts and always tell themselves

74
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:24,030
that they must be good to others and must be well behaved etc.

75
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,451
These people can sometimes be in trouble.

76
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:36,470
Suddenly they get exasperated and others cannot understand,

77
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:43,361
why these well behaved people are annoyed.

78
00:06:43,826 --> 00:06:50,132
Also they lose their inner peace.

79
00:06:50,358 --> 00:07:00,987
All the beauty within them is destroyed. So we should be always thoughtless.

80
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:07,105
Ban all thoughts from your mind

81
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:14,664
and then you would automatically remain at the centre in the Vilamba.

82
00:07:16,043 --> 00:07:20,476
You must make all efforts. Now you would ask

83
00:07:20,562 --> 00:07:25,079
“Mother how can we do anything without thinking?”

84
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:31,173
But what are thoughts? They are hollow.

85
00:07:31,293 --> 00:07:35,881
In thoughtless state you are one with the God’s power

86
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:41,688
that is, the drop, which is you, comes in the ocean which is God.

87
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:45,423
Hence His power also comes to you.

88
00:07:45,503 --> 00:07:50,026
Does this finger think? Is it not still moving?

89
00:07:50,107 --> 00:07:55,011
Give your thoughts to God and ask Him to think about you.

90
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:01,327
But it is rather difficult, because you are not thoughtless.

91
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:06,032
Many people say “we have surrendered everything”,

92
00:08:06,113 --> 00:08:11,488
but it does not happen because they do it only in talking.

93
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:14,707
Surrendering is not just talking.

94
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:20,410
When you attain thoughtlessness then surrendering is automatic .

95
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:23,237
That is you have stopped thinking.

96
00:08:23,318 --> 00:08:26,738
When you stop thinking you come to the centre.

97
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:32,628
When at the centre, immediately you go into 
thoughtless awareness, i.e. become one with God’s power

98
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:36,695
and when you are one with the God’s power, He looks after you.

99
00:08:36,776 --> 00:08:40,673
He takes care of your small things also. You will be amazed.

100
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:44,609
Sometimes try doing things on your own.

101
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:51,861
Then you’ll experience “Sankalpa vikalpa karoti”
 (Man proposes and God disposes).

102
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:57,499
If you want to go through a particular way, try doing it.

103
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,722
All the countries have tried it and failed.

104
00:09:01,803 --> 00:09:06,511
It is worth trying and after that you will realise

105
00:09:06,591 --> 00:09:10,851
that what you were doing earlier was wrong.

106
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:19,477
So once you are in thoughtlessness you will get all inspirations,

107
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:24,269
all powers and everything.

108
00:09:29,554 --> 00:09:35,370
The idea that you get in thoughtlessness is an inspiration.

109
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:38,537
You will be surprised.

110
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:42,962
Everything will come to you as if on a plate.

111
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:46,286
You are standing to give a speech.

112
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,402
Just be thoughtless and start.

113
00:09:48,489 --> 00:09:56,016
Although you have never given a speech earlier or do not even know how to do it

114
00:09:56,097 --> 00:10:02,464
or have no special knowledge of any subject, you will speak so well

115
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:08,348
that others will be astonished how you know so much.

116
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:12,909
But once you are deep in the thoughtless state,

117
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:18,205
all comes from there and not from your brain.

118
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:21,460
I tell you about Me. You pray:

119
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:26,828
‘Mother kindly see that such and such happens to me’

120
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:31,126
and I do not think about that.

121
00:10:31,206 --> 00:10:36,331
It is amazing. I put all that in the thoughtlessness.

122
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:39,674
All machinery is working there. J

123
00:10:39,755 --> 00:10:44,755
ust put it to that machinery and it is all ready.

124
00:10:44,836 --> 00:10:49,164
Allow that machinery, you can call it silent machinery, to work.

125
00:10:49,245 --> 00:10:52,648
You should put all your problems to it.

126
00:10:52,729 --> 00:10:56,616
But it is very difficult for intellectuals

127
00:10:56,697 --> 00:11:01,408
because their habit is to go on thinking about everything.

128
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:05,915
You should be able to go into thoughtlessness

129
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:12,363
while trying to understand a subject.

130
00:11:12,443 --> 00:11:15,127
All becomes clear automatically.

131
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:20,711
Research that you are doing should also be in thoughtless state.

132
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:25,183
Let your hands work while you are thoughtless.

133
00:11:25,264 --> 00:11:29,477
You can do your research extremely well in this way. I tell you many things.

134
00:11:29,665 --> 00:11:33,407
I have never read science in my life and know nothing about it.

135
00:11:33,487 --> 00:11:38,164
Still I tell you all that. Where does all the knowledge come from?

136
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:42,667
From the thoughtlessness; I only speak and see all that is going on.

137
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:45,854
It was all kept ready in that computer which is speaking.

138
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:48,067
If you are not in the thoughtless state

139
00:11:48,147 --> 00:11:52,861
you do not use your computer and put your brain on top of it.

140
00:11:52,948 --> 00:11:58,510
It is such on old computer and lot of accurate work has been done on it.

141
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,048
You are bound to make mistakes if you use your own brain

142
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:07,554
and do not consult the computer. It has no meaning.

143
00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:11,296
Thus the solution for all this is the prefix “PRA”.

144
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:17,924
We say PRASHIKSHAN (Enlightened Education) in which we use the suffix PRA.

145
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:23,352
[Ndlr – Whenever prefix “PRA” is used (in Sanskrit, 
Hindi or Marathi) it means enlightened].

146
00:12:23,433 --> 00:12:28,871
All that happens in the thoughtless state is enlightened 
and thus is PRA.

147
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:33,262
It is so PRACHANDA (Enormous) – here again it is PRA.

148
00:12:33,342 --> 00:12:37,614
Some other words are PRAKASHIT (brought to light),

149
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:43,047
PRADNYA (wise), where we use the prefix PRA meaning enlightened.

150
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:47,650
Light never talks. If you switch on the light in the room,

151
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:51,267
the light won’t speak or give you any ideas.

152
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:54,552
It would just make everything visible.

153
00:12:54,632 --> 00:13:00,131
Same is about the light of thoughtlessness.

154
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:06,138
That ‘NIH’ is common in all such words like ‘Nirvichar’ (thoughtless),

155
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:15,836
Nirvajya (Selfless), Nirahankar (egoless), Nirakar (formless).

156
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:20,074
Thus lots of words come from the prefix NIH.

157
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:27,335
You establish it and then you come into Nirvikalpa (doubtless state).

158
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:33,452
First become thoughtless and then doubtless (Nirvikalpa).

159
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:39,113
Then all your doubts go and you know that there is some power that works.

160
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:44,484
It works very fast and is all subtle.
 You will be amazed how it happens.

161
00:13:44,564 --> 00:13:48,647
This is also about time. I never see watch.

162
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:54,582
Sometimes it stops and shows, when the time is 3.00 o’clock.

163
00:13:54,662 --> 00:13:57,930
Just to show others I wind my watch.

164
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:04,284
But my real watch is in the thoughtlessness. 
It is permanently stopped.

165
00:14:04,364 --> 00:14:10,200
If anything is to be done, it takes place at the right time.

166
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,301
Then there are no regrets whether it is late or not.

167
00:14:15,382 --> 00:14:18,094
Whatever it may be I am where I am.

168
00:14:18,175 --> 00:14:24,720
Yesterday, my car failed but I was relaxing 
because I wanted to see the stars.

169
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:29,733
That beauty is not visible in London and I wanted to see it.

170
00:14:29,813 --> 00:14:32,786
Thus I was enjoying the starlit night.

171
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:37,206
Others were worried and they started giving vibrations (bandhans).

172
00:14:37,286 --> 00:14:40,652
I told them, why are you wasting your vibrations?

173
00:14:40,732 --> 00:14:44,964
See the stars which you do not watch often. 
I had to see the beauty in the sky.

174
00:14:45,045 --> 00:14:47,531
Its splendour was spread all over the sky.

175
00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:50,438
The sky thought Mataji should see it also

176
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,602
because (it thinks) She always Her attention only on Sahaja yogis.

177
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:56,049
I wanted to get down and watch it but I was worried

178
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,247
that the Sahaja yogis might think that I am in trouble.

179
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:02,448
So I was just watching the sky from where I was and enjoying it.

180
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:05,426
In short, you should not be a slave of anything.

181
00:15:05,507 --> 00:15:12,391
If you are thoughtless God takes you everywhere as if on his hands.

182
00:15:12,618 --> 00:15:14,685
He makes all arrangements.

183
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:19,484
He knows everything and there is no need to tell him about anything.

184
00:15:19,565 --> 00:15:23,910
But you must see whether you are in the PRAVAHA (main stream) or not.

185
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,720
You should see if you are in God’s Pravaha.

186
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,651
If you are not in it then you are stuck up somewhere on the bank;

187
00:15:31,744 --> 00:15:35,845
then current comes and takes you in, twice or thrice

188
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:37,849
but again you are on the bank.

189
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:42,661
Then you say ‘Mataji, nothing goes smoothly for me’. It won’t.

190
00:15:47,428 --> 00:15:49,619
Because you are entangled.

191
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:55,097
Shri Ganesha’s praise that you sing is excellent. It says,

192
00:15:55,424 --> 00:15:58,388
PADTA PRAVAHI “flowing in the main stream (Pravaha)”

193
00:15:58,468 --> 00:16:01,678
which means enlightened main stream.

194
00:16:01,758 --> 00:16:04,797
We should swim in the pravaha.

195
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:08,631
You should not bring your own separate, current in it.

196
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:11,350
Pravaha also means enlightened vehicle.

197
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:19,841
The Arti of Shri Ganesha also says ‘Nirvani Rakshave’, 
i.e. protect me when I am dying.

198
00:16:19,921 --> 00:16:24,058
You also pray ‘Raksha Raksha Parameshwara’

199
00:16:24,138 --> 00:16:26,935
O God protect me, but you want to protect yourself.

200
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:33,111
Why should, then, God protect you? He says, “let him protect himself.”

201
00:16:33,217 --> 00:16:39,978
Then you have all the sufferings of the world upon you like big mountains.

202
00:16:40,575 --> 00:16:46,324
I feel like laughing. These are all like balloons. They have no meaning.

203
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:54,607
What I want to emphasise is that you must learn to go deep within yourself

204
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:59,837
and realise all this in the thoughtlessness then you can become Nirvikalpa (doubtless).

205
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:03,246
You should attain Nirasaktata – Asaktata means attachments.

206
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:05,602
You must have no attachment (Nirasakta).

207
00:17:05,683 --> 00:17:07,902
We have here, (India) ‘my son, my daughter’.

208
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:09,803
In England, it is just the opposite.

209
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:14,328
There, they are not attached to son or daughter.

210
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,358
They are worried only about themselves.

211
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:21,075
Son is left to the dogs. They even kill their children.

212
00:17:21,155 --> 00:17:24,408
Some might not believe it but they kill.

213
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:28,411
Each week a mother kills two children. They are so cruel.

214
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:36,676
Here you have this attachment; my son, my daughter, my husband, my house etc.,

215
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:43,061
everything is mine and at the end your “self” is left out!

216
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:49,401
You should say “Nothing is mine and everything is yours.”

217
00:17:50,205 --> 00:17:56,524
Kabir says “so long as a goat is alive it is bleating ‘main, main’ (I, I)

218
00:17:56,605 --> 00:18:01,639
but when it is slaughtered there is no life left,

219
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,795
she realizes that I spent my whole life in saying “main, main”.

220
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,601
Those whom I called mine have turned out to be useless

221
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:19,785
– everybody in the family, in the house –

222
00:18:19,955 --> 00:18:27,230
all those whom I considered to be mine have turned out to be useless.

223
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:34,439
They themselves killed me and ate. Then it realizes it’s mistake.

224
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,486
Then someone creates taut strings of its guts

225
00:18:40,597 --> 00:18:44,076
and fixes them on an musical instrument.

226
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:48,096
When these strings are pulled they make a sound “Toohie, Toohie”

227
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:51,407
(you alone are.) You must become like that.

228
00:18:51,488 --> 00:18:53,933
Once you are established in the idea I am nought, I have no existence,

229
00:18:54,014 --> 00:18:57,841
then only you will understand the word ‘NIH’.

230
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:05,501
Let us consider the word ‘LA’. It is Lalita’s word.

231
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:08,294
My second name is Lalita.

232
00:19:08,374 --> 00:19:13,173
It is the blessing of Devi. It is Her weapon.

233
00:19:13,294 --> 00:19:21,425
When LA i.e. goddess becomes Lalit
or when the Shakti becomes Lalit

234
00:19:21,579 --> 00:19:29,555
which means active that is when
the vibrations rise within Her.

235
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:40,886
The waves of vibrations which you are feeling on
your palms that shakti when is activated is Lalita Shakti.

236
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:46,141
It is full of beauty and love.

237
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:53,039
Most important is that it is love. When the power
of love becomes active, it becomes LA Shakti.

238
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,305
She envelops you from all sides.

239
00:19:56,391 --> 00:20:03,265
When she is active, what is the worry? What is your power?

240
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:06,809
Can you make even one fruit from tree?

241
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:11,575
Show me if you can convert one fruit on a tree.

242
00:20:11,655 --> 00:20:16,311
Leave, fruit, you cannot make even a leaf or a root!

243
00:20:16,391 --> 00:20:18,666
Only ‘LA’ shakti does all the work.

244
00:20:18,747 --> 00:20:21,797
The realisation that you have got is also from this power.

245
00:20:21,878 --> 00:20:24,757
From this Shakti have emerged ‘MA’ Shakti and ‘NIH’ Shakti.

246
00:20:24,838 --> 00:20:28,251
‘NIH’ Shakti is Shri Brahmadeva’s Power
Shri Saraswati Shakti.

247
00:20:28,345 --> 00:20:33,606
And in Saraswati Shakti you must attain
the qualities of ‘NIH’.

248
00:20:33,686 --> 00:20:39,826
Attaining ‘NIH’ is you must attain a state
of ANASAKTATA ( complete detachment).

249
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:50,093
You must become completely detached. ‘LA’ shakti
has love in it. She relates us to others.

250
00:20:50,255 --> 00:20:54,434
Word LA comes in words like LALAM, LAVANYA.

251
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:57,294
All these words have got prefix LA.

252
00:20:57,374 --> 00:21:02,888
When we want a child to stop crying we say LA, LA, LA…..

253
00:21:02,968 --> 00:21:09,444
Word LA has a sweetness of its own and
you should impress others with it.

254
00:21:09,524 --> 00:21:14,175
You should use this Shakti while speaking to others.

255
00:21:14,255 --> 00:21:20,878
What should you do when this Shakti the power
of love, is spread everywhere in the nature.

256
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:28,551
You should leave all thoughts to the first power
 because thoughts come from the first power.

257
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:33,930
What should you do in the last power, i.e. LA Shakti?

258
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:38,946
You should enjoy the bliss of love.

259
00:21:39,026 --> 00:21:42,711
How? By becoming TANMAYA (forgetting yourself).

260
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:47,779
Has anyone measured how much one loves others?

261
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,944
We should measure it. How you enjoy it?

262
00:21:52,024 --> 00:21:55,032
Does it occur to you, how much you love others?

263
00:21:55,153 --> 00:22:00,420
I always enjoy loving others; feel,
how the love is flowing everywhere.

264
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:07,156
I do not know whether you feel or not.
I cannot understand much about human beings.

265
00:22:07,236 --> 00:22:12,637
But I feel how the love is flowing all over.
It is so joy giving.

266
00:22:12,717 --> 00:22:20,310
Like a musician who forgets himself in his own
melodies and feels how his music is flowing everywhere.

267
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:24,167
Similarly love must flow without any interruption.

268
00:22:24,247 --> 00:22:32,716
That is, the same as Lalam Shakti, which is the power
of waves of vibrations, i.e. Lalita Shakti.

269
00:22:33,283 --> 00:22:36,527
Therefore, you should first achieve Lalita Shakti.

270
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:42,015
You must first find out how is your attitude towards others.

271
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:50,264
Some people of low category look at others with
an idea to steal something or to get some benefit.

272
00:22:50,344 --> 00:22:56,744
Like when a thief comes he’ll try to see if there are
new shoes lying around.

273
00:22:56,824 --> 00:22:58,310
He will steal them.

274
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:04,752
Then they come in and try to find out if
there are rich people around.

275
00:23:04,832 --> 00:23:09,886
Where are their pockets and see
if they can find their purse.

276
00:23:09,966 --> 00:23:15,380
Then if they see a person in power
then they shower praises on them,

277
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:20,104
try to be friendly with them and try
to obtain some gains from them.

278
00:23:20,184 --> 00:23:33,328
This is the view point of very low category
of people who try to obtain benefit from everyone.

279
00:23:33,408 --> 00:23:40,009
There are some, who are interested
in finding other people’s faults.

280
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:47,520
I do not know what pleasure they get,
but they keep looking for other’s shortcomings.

281
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:54,860
What are they going to gain from such an attitude?

282
00:23:56,053 --> 00:23:59,400
This way they become aloof and then suffer.

283
00:24:01,353 --> 00:24:11,560
Only man can teach how to invite troubles.

284
00:24:12,855 --> 00:24:24,678
It is not possible for Me. How glad am I to meet all.

285
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:35,740
You should use Lalam Shakti in such a way that you should
go into thoughtlessness while looking at other person.

286
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:43,585
That person also will then become thoughtless.

287
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:49,541
Hence I ask you to do ‘Bandhan’. It is helpful
to do ‘Bandhan’ to ‘NIH’ Shakti

288
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:53,091
and ‘LA’ Shakti which is transferring
‘LA’ Shakti into ‘NIH’ Shakti.

289
00:24:53,171 --> 00:24:59,165
I have to tell many people to raise their left side
and put to the right.

290
00:24:59,245 --> 00:25:03,331
I tell those people to raise their left sides,

291
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:08,162
who are very proud or think they are working
very hard or are very busy.

292
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:13,443
It is filling our own love into own five elements.

293
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:23,827
Love in our hearts or the power of that love
from our hearts should be filled into the power of action

294
00:25:23,907 --> 00:25:29,090
as if you are painting with colours on a canvas.

295
00:25:29,211 --> 00:25:35,531
When the power of love is filled in the power
of action in a person,

296
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:41,621
he becomes extremely loving and that love
gradually shines through his behaviours

297
00:25:41,742 --> 00:25:44,644
and in his personality and flows to others.

298
00:25:44,724 --> 00:25:51,604
In  Marathi it is called SNEHALTE. It makes
his every action enjoyable to others.

299
00:25:51,725 --> 00:25:59,917
Such person becomes so alluring that you feel
relaxed and happy in his company for hours.

300
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:11,914
So, your love should become enjoyable and winning
other people’s hearts.

301
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:20,626
This becomes useful in such a way that we get friends
and the affection for each other grows.

302
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:29,805
Everyone feels that there is a place where one can get
all love and affection.

303
00:26:30,011 --> 00:26:34,250
Hence we must cultivate the God’s power of Love.

304
00:26:34,434 --> 00:26:44,438
If we get any thought we must tell ourselves
that we are throwing dirt in the Ganges of God’s power.

305
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:51,105
With this attitude of mind our ‘LA’ Shakti
the power of love will remain absolutely clean

306
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:54,361
and we will enjoy that cleanliness.

307
00:26:54,441 --> 00:26:57,858
You should never be critical of others.

308
00:26:57,979 --> 00:27:02,009
If you ask me about some person, I can
only tell you regarding his kundalini

309
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:06,152
and on which chakra he is caught
at present or gets frequently caught.

310
00:27:06,232 --> 00:27:13,415
I cannot understand anything beyond that; but if
someone asks me how he is or how his nature is etc.

311
00:27:13,495 --> 00:27:15,892
I cannot understand the question.

312
00:27:15,972 --> 00:27:22,033
If one comes to me criticizing someone,
I say ‘what is nature ?’ It is so changing!

313
00:27:22,154 --> 00:27:29,839
River is flowing here. Who can tell where
it will be in future? You have to see where you stand.

314
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:36,717
If you are on this side in the dirt, you are bound
to feel it unusual that the river is flowing here.

315
00:27:36,797 --> 00:27:41,358
I see from the side of the ocean so I know
where this river will join the sea.

316
00:27:41,438 --> 00:27:48,525
Transformation is a continuous process in Sahaja yoga.
So never brand anybody as useless.

317
00:27:48,605 --> 00:27:56,590
Every person changes and he must change.
The work of Sahaja Yoga is to bring about the change.

318
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:04,537
Those who believe in Sahaja Yoga should never
say that such and such person has become useless.

319
00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:08,939
Everybody must be given the chance.

320
00:28:09,491 --> 00:28:18,000
You should try to see where you were, where
you reached and where the river will go further.

321
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:26,429
If you think this way you will not only respect
yourself but will also respect others.

322
00:28:26,509 --> 00:28:31,770
One who has no respect for himself never respects others.

323
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:35,131
We must develop ‘Lalam’ Shakti.

324
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:46,851
I cannot adequately describe the joy of it even by writing
 a book, because it cannot be expressed through words

325
00:28:47,084 --> 00:28:50,584
they are very much inadequate.

326
00:28:50,664 --> 00:28:59,496
In other words if you have to describe smile
you can only tell how the muscles move

327
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:05,881
but you cannot tell the effects of the smiles.

328
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:14,742
You should allow this power to be effective
and develop it with this LALAM Shakti.

329
00:29:14,842 --> 00:29:22,047
Man gets a kind of beauty, an elegance
and good nature from ‘Lalam’ Shakti.

330
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:33,908
You must see that this power grows through
 your speech, behaviour and other activities.

331
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:40,839
Some person’s annoyance is also pleasant.

332
00:29:41,086 --> 00:29:47,140
He gets annoyed in one minute and laughs in second minute.

333
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:58,408
That sweet and pleasant power is called Lalita Shakti.

334
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:09,634
People have completely distorted its idea.
They say that it is the power of destruction.

335
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:14,837
But it is not at all correct. This power is
extremely beautiful, creative and artistic.

336
00:30:15,031 --> 00:30:22,354
Suppose you sow a seed, then some of its
parts get destroyed this is also ‘Lalita’ Shakti.

337
00:30:22,522 --> 00:30:28,038
But the destruction is very gentle and easy.

338
00:30:28,172 --> 00:30:34,855
The seed then grows into a tree that has leaves.

339
00:30:35,906 --> 00:30:41,177
Those leaves also fall, which is again very spontaneous.
Then come the flowers.

340
00:30:43,098 --> 00:30:50,246
When the flowers become fruits some of
its components fall and then come the fruits.

341
00:30:50,585 --> 00:31:02,053
Those fruits are also cut for eating. The taste
that you get after eating is also this power.

342
00:31:02,174 --> 00:31:05,379
In this way these two powers work.

343
00:31:05,461 --> 00:31:13,381
You should understand that you cannot make
any statue without cutting and chopping.

344
00:31:13,758 --> 00:31:20,178
If you understand that this chip-chopping
is of the same kind,

345
00:31:20,258 --> 00:31:25,008
you should not feel bad, if you have to do it sometimes.

346
00:31:25,096 --> 00:31:34,158
That is also necessary. But an artist does it
artistically whereas an artless person does it bluntly.

347
00:31:34,238 --> 00:31:38,785
So this power depends on how much art is in you.

348
00:31:38,865 --> 00:31:46,118
Sometimes you look at a picture and you want to keep looking.

349
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:52,741
If someone asks you what is so nice in that picture,
you cannot express it in words.

350
00:31:53,644 --> 00:31:57,125
You only look at the picture.

351
00:31:57,246 --> 00:32:01,106
Some pictures are such that you become thoughtless
just by looking at them.

352
00:32:01,227 --> 00:32:06,793
In that thoughtless state you are enjoying
 the whole pleasure of it, and this state is the very best.

353
00:32:06,873 --> 00:32:12,853
Instead of comparing it with something
or describing it with similes

354
00:32:12,948 --> 00:32:20,317
you should enjoy the bliss of this state, to your hearts’ content.

355
00:32:24,128 --> 00:32:31,702
It is called RASASWAD. There are no words or no expression to describe it.

356
00:32:31,823 --> 00:32:41,405
You have to experience it from within. All should have this experience.

357
00:32:43,157 --> 00:32:48,751
The letter MA is very interesting. ‘MA’ is the word of Mahalakshmi.

358
00:32:48,858 --> 00:32:58,288
‘MA’ is the power of Dharma (Righteousness)
and also the power of our evolution.

359
00:32:58,842 --> 00:33:06,388
In ‘MA’ Shakti you have to put in effort, assimilate and achieve Mastery.

360
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:13,156
For example, an artist conceives the idea
of his creation with his ‘LA’ Shakti,

361
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:23,532
he puts it practice with ‘NIH’ Shakti and then uses
‘MA’ Shakti to bring it in conformity with his idea.

362
00:33:24,902 --> 00:33:36,044
At every stage he checks whether it agrees
with his idea and tries to improve, if it does not.

363
00:33:36,197 --> 00:33:40,752
He does that again and again. This is ‘MA’ Shakti.

364
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:46,564
That is, if something is not good do it again,
once, twice and so on.

365
00:33:46,704 --> 00:34:04,114
This job of improving involves efforts.
We have to improve ourselves also.

366
00:34:04,235 --> 00:34:10,395
But for this, the evolution would have been impossible.
God has to make enormous efforts.

367
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:17,237
We have to accomplish ‘MA’ Shakti and preserve it.

368
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:27,688
If it is not done, other two powers fall off,
because this power is the centre of gravity.

369
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:40,105
So you should be at the centre of gravity,
and the centre of gravity is ‘MA’ Shakti of our evolution.

370
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:48,005
Other two powers will become active in you only
when you grow along the power of evolution.

371
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:56,822
But you must fully understand and develop ‘MA’ Shakti.
You should not only depend on God.

372
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:06,317
So long as you are not realized, it is alright to say
that if God loves you He should come to you,

373
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:11,953
but thereafter you cannot say so. For with ‘MA’ Shakti
you have to balance other two powers.

374
00:35:12,033 --> 00:35:17,698
In melody you balance the tunes; while painting a picture
you bring about the balance of different colours.

375
00:35:17,778 --> 00:35:22,325
Similarly you have to achieve the balance
of ‘NIH’ Shakti and ‘LA’ Shakti.

376
00:35:22,405 --> 00:35:27,733
You have to work for attaining this balance.
On many occasions you lose it.

377
00:35:27,813 --> 00:35:32,085
A Sahaja Yogi who can maintain it, rises to a very high level.

378
00:35:32,165 --> 00:35:35,566
Very emotional Sahaja Yogi is not good.

379
00:35:35,646 --> 00:35:40,360
Similarly very busy Sahaja Yogi is also not very good.

380
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,830
One should activate one’s power of love
and continuously monitor it’s progress.

381
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:52,505
Suppose I follow certain method but even in that
every time I do something different.

382
00:35:52,585 --> 00:35:59,641
You must have seen that every time, I come out
with something new, some new method.

383
00:35:59,721 --> 00:36:05,373
If this does not work, try some other thing.
If that also does not work, do something else.

384
00:36:05,453 --> 00:36:11,471
If something cannot enter (the body) through the head,
try to enter it through the tail.

385
00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:18,287
Sometimes I tell it with a smile or with a cry
or try to explain it lovingly, “It should be like this”.

386
00:36:18,367 --> 00:36:20,300
Nobody should fix his method.

387
00:36:20,402 --> 00:36:23,946
You rise in the morning apply vermilion,
pay obeisance to Mataji;

388
00:36:24,026 --> 00:36:26,572
this is all mechanical. It is not a living process.

389
00:36:26,652 --> 00:36:31,915
In a living process, you should find out different new methods.

390
00:36:31,995 --> 00:36:38,782
I always give the example of the root of a tree.

391
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:46,564
It penetrates deeper and deeper into the soil
circumventing the obstacles.

392
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:49,619
It does not fight with them.

393
00:36:49,699 --> 00:36:56,932
[The roots] would not have been able
to hold the tree without the obstacles.

394
00:36:57,012 --> 00:37:05,378
Hence the problems are necessary because
you cannot progress without the problems.

395
00:37:05,499 --> 00:37:12,384
The power that teaches you how to overcome
these problems is ‘MA Shakti’.

396
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:18,210
Therefore it is ‘MA Shakti’ i.e. Mother’s power.

397
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,675
For that first thing required is wisdom.

398
00:37:22,796 --> 00:37:28,317
If someone says that I’ve been doing this
in the past so I’ll continue doing it.

399
00:37:28,437 --> 00:37:34,334
For example a person is very mild natured
and says, “Mother I am very soft what can I do?”

400
00:37:34,455 --> 00:37:40,201
I tell him to change himself and become a lion.

401
00:37:40,322 --> 00:37:47,081
If some other person is a lion I tell him to become a goat.

402
00:37:47,285 --> 00:37:55,424
Otherwise it won’t work. You have to change your methods.

403
00:37:55,584 --> 00:38:01,776
Person who cannot change his methods
cannot spread Sahaja Yoga

404
00:38:01,856 --> 00:38:07,367
because he sticks to only one way,
with which people get bored.

405
00:38:07,488 --> 00:38:15,610
You should find new ways.
This is how ‘MA Shakti’ works.

406
00:38:15,891 --> 00:38:29,397
Ladies are expert in it. They make different recipes every
day and the husbands are eager to know the menu.

407
00:38:29,616 --> 00:38:36,267
Thus they do not go to the restaurants but come straight home.

408
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:51,905
This is the shakti with which you accomplish
your balance and concentration.

409
00:38:52,130 --> 00:39:07,031
When you take it to the highest state, you get
the vibrations flow from your balance and wisdom.

410
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:17,427
They will not flow if you do not have wisdom.

411
00:39:19,074 --> 00:39:22,276
Person from whom the maximum vibrations are

412
00:39:22,356 --> 00:39:26,178
flowing is a wise person;
in fact it is his wisdom that is flowing.

413
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:30,137
On this basis, it can be assessed
how great Sahaja Yogi you are.

414
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,748
Even if you pretend to be a
great Sahaja yogi, it’ll be shown

415
00:39:34,828 --> 00:39:38,296
when you come on my Feet
and see that catch on your chakras.

416
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:43,117
You should know when you are caught
that you have lost your balance.

417
00:39:43,198 --> 00:39:46,761
The imbalance shows that MA Shakti is weak in you.

418
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:51,598
The first letter from any real name Mataji is MA that is mother

419
00:39:51,678 --> 00:39:55,334
and this work has been done only by ‘MA’ shakti within me.

420
00:39:55,414 --> 00:40:03,314
This was not possible if only ‘LA shakti’ or ‘NIH shakti’ were there.

421
00:40:03,395 --> 00:40:07,568
I have come with all the three powers but MA shakti is on top.

422
00:40:07,648 --> 00:40:10,461
You have seen that MA shakti is Mother’s power.

423
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:14,267
It must be proved that She is our Mother.

424
00:40:14,347 --> 00:40:21,025
Will you accept if someone comes and says
“I am your Mother.” You won’t.

425
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:22,620
Mother must be proved.

426
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,919
What is Mother?

427
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:31,370
We have a place in Her heart. We have every right on Her
and She has on us, because She loves us very much.

428
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:34,025
Her love is absolutely NIRVAJYA (disinterested).

429
00:40:34,105 --> 00:40:40,001
She always wishes well of us and has nothing
in Her heart except love for us.

430
00:40:40,082 --> 00:40:43,471
You will have faith in the Mother only if you under

431
00:40:43,551 --> 00:40:47,681
If your mother is dangerous who will believe in Her?

432
00:40:47,761 --> 00:40:53,802
You should prove all these to others.

433
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:57,490
Sahaja Yogi should be able to do that.

434
00:40:57,571 --> 00:41:03,465
Other people should realise that he is a wise person.

435
00:41:05,298 --> 00:41:13,202
For that you need the balance; the balance
between the powers of love and action

436
00:41:13,282 --> 00:41:19,393
and it should be so beautiful that people are influenced
by such person without their knowledge.

437
00:41:19,473 --> 00:41:24,228
Sahaja Yogi should accomplish it.

438
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:30,182
You think at home how to activate these three powers and use them.

439
00:41:30,262 --> 00:41:36,280
‘NIH’ Shakti should give all beauty and creativity to your homes.

440
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:41,456
You should device new ways and means of contacting the people.

441
00:41:41,536 --> 00:41:47,618
These powers should be used to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

442
00:41:47,698 --> 00:41:56,996
For their proper use your ‘NIH’ Shakti
 i.e. the power of action should be very strong.

443
00:41:57,096 --> 00:42:02,467
Albeit, you must have main ‘LA’ Shakti
that is the power of love.

444
00:42:02,548 --> 00:42:08,621
But LA Shakti is to be activated with ‘NIH’ Shakti.

445
00:42:08,702 --> 00:42:11,716
But if one way does not work, find some other way,

446
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:16,251
try first red and yellow if it does not suit, take yellow and green

447
00:42:16,331 --> 00:42:19,370
and if that also does not help do something else.

448
00:42:19,451 --> 00:42:23,954
It would be wise not to be adamant.
An adamant man cannot do anything in Sahaja Yoga.

449
00:42:24,034 --> 00:42:29,410
All that you want to do is to spread Sahaja Yoga
 for the wellbeing of human beings.

450
00:42:29,491 --> 00:42:32,188
Then try different ways.

451
00:42:32,269 --> 00:42:36,260
I always fall a prey to your insistence

452
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:40,891
because if I do not do as per your
wishes then you’ll be more obstinate.

453
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:43,434
So I go along with your wishes.

454
00:42:43,514 --> 00:42:49,032
But sometimes I insist on having my way
if I want to go somewhere or do something.

455
00:42:49,113 --> 00:42:54,056
Only occasionally I try to have my way but
most of the times I do as per your wishes

456
00:42:54,137 --> 00:42:57,596
because I know that human beings are not like me.

457
00:42:57,677 --> 00:43:01,780
You can never tell what an obstinate person will do,

458
00:43:01,861 --> 00:43:05,661
you should not allow him to go to an extremity
like removing his own eyes or nose.

459
00:43:05,742 --> 00:43:09,017
Thus one should not challenge obstinacy of a person.

460
00:43:09,098 --> 00:43:13,487
I know all this from ‘MA’ Shakti.
But you should not insist on particular things.

461
00:43:13,568 --> 00:43:16,881
Mataji does not insist.
Whatever is there, you should accept.

462
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:22,608
Whatever you do you should have in mind
that you are doing an important work.

463
00:43:22,688 --> 00:43:29,462
I have no desire. There is no ‘LA’ Shakti
or ‘NIH’ Shakti or ‘MA’ Shakti within me.

464
00:43:29,542 --> 00:43:38,424
There is nothing. I even do not know
that I am these powers. I only witness all the play.

465
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:45,735
When the life is changed like this there
will be ‘Siddha’ Sahaja Yogis

466
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:54,702
(i.e. those who have complete mastery over Sahaja Yoga)
 among human beings.

467
00:43:55,499 --> 00:44:03,948
So far they have not become siddhas.

468
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:28,305
You have to achieve the mastery.

469
00:44:28,385 --> 00:44:33,770
Siddha Sahaja Yogi is the one who becomes
completely one with God and wins Him over.

470
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:40,035
He has to do everything for that.
I am now going away for a year.

471
00:44:40,115 --> 00:44:43,588
After that, it is to be seen how and
where you use your mastery.

472
00:44:43,669 --> 00:44:47,890
Sometimes I tell you not to do certain things.
You should not feel bad about that.

473
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:53,116
You should not feel sorry in ‘MA’ Shakti because
I must tell you not to do certain things.

474
00:44:53,196 --> 00:44:56,422
But some people feel bad about it.

475
00:44:56,502 --> 00:45:00,340
There was a yogi in Mumbai, who used
to take others on his feet.

476
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,834
I did not know anything about it.
Once one of his disciples came to me.

477
00:45:04,914 --> 00:45:10,582
I was unaware that he had disciples of his own.
So I asked him why do you take others on your feet?

478
00:45:10,662 --> 00:45:16,278
He felt very bad about it. I said that the
vibrations of both of you have gone down.

479
00:45:16,358 --> 00:45:22,143
So I said, you should take a promise
that you’ll not take anyone on your feet.

480
00:45:22,223 --> 00:45:31,034
That’s why your mastery has decreased.
It is absolutely forbidden to take anyone on your feet.

481
00:45:31,114 --> 00:45:37,045
That is the only solution. You must remember
that you have to become master (Siddha).

482
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:40,318
All others must accept that you are Siddha.

483
00:45:40,398 --> 00:45:44,905
It should be clear to them the very
moment they see you that you are Siddha.

484
00:45:44,985 --> 00:45:50,999
You must ensure this. If it happens everything will be fine.

485
00:45:54,264 --> 00:46:02,165
One day I told you that you should invite
your friends and relations for lunch or dinner

486
00:46:02,245 --> 00:46:08,922
or for some function or tell them that
you are arranging a big puja.

487
00:46:09,002 --> 00:46:17,019
Also call some Sahaja Yogis on that day
and give realization to all your guests.

488
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:21,076
If you do this for one year it will be very beneficial.

489
00:46:21,156 --> 00:46:27,065
This is a very beautiful talk, it can be
translated into English and distributed.

490
00:46:27,146 --> 00:46:28,586
May God Bless You!
