WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:06.080
I am overjoyed really today

00:06.200 --> 00:08.880
to see you all here

00:09.480 --> 00:14.440
to celebrate the Diwali Puja.

00:15.360 --> 00:19.480
We were to be in Portugal

00:19.680 --> 00:23.640
but it was not so - so we are here.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.520
Diwali Puja is a very small puja

00:31.640 --> 00:35.400
but extremely significant.

00:36.160 --> 00:39.400
Firstly in Diwali,

00:39.600 --> 00:44.800
the first day they buy something

00:45.000 --> 00:47.320
for the family.

00:48.680 --> 00:55.480
You can - maybe some cooking utensil could be,

00:55.680 --> 00:58.360
an ornament for the wife

00:58.560 --> 01:00.320
or something like that.

01:01.080 --> 01:07.600
Because that is the day of housewife.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.680
And that day is to be celebrated

01:11.880 --> 01:19.600
as the housewife’s, I should say, homage to her.

01:21.920 --> 01:26.560
As a result you know in India even now

01:26.760 --> 01:30.480
housewives are very much respected.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.640
Actually they are respected all over.

01:32.840 --> 01:39.000
You will be amazed that even

01:39.200 --> 01:44.240
in the protocol of the government

01:44.440 --> 01:47.480
receptions anywhere

01:47.680 --> 01:51.680
the wife is very important.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.880
And where she is sitting,

01:54.080 --> 01:57.440
what is her position is very important.

01:57.640 --> 01:58.840
Even today

01:59.040 --> 02:04.240
in the most modern and advanced countries also

02:04.440 --> 02:07.320
they have a special respect for the housewife.

02:07.520 --> 02:10.680
The housewife may not be educated,

02:10.880 --> 02:15.080
she may be a very simple woman,

02:15.280 --> 02:18.000
she may not be very modern.

02:20.320 --> 02:24.720
There was an experience for Me:

02:25.640 --> 02:29.240
in London we had a program

02:30.000 --> 02:33.120
where we all were invited,

02:33.320 --> 02:40.200
and the head of the delegation,

02:40.400 --> 02:42.760
his wife was missing.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.920
So they asked Me, “Where is she?"

02:46.120 --> 02:50.120
Because there is a seat for her, she has to sit there.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.000
I said, “I don’t know, I didn’t see her.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.280
She must be somewhere here.”

02:55.320 --> 02:58.240
So just before starting

02:58.840 --> 03:05.480
I went to the washing room

03:06.360 --> 03:07.480
and I was surprised

03:07.680 --> 03:10.480
she was sitting in the waiting room there.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.600
I said, “What are you doing here?

03:12.800 --> 03:15.560
They are all waiting for you outside.”

03:15.760 --> 03:19.800
So she said, “They asked me to sit here.”

03:20.000 --> 03:21.720
So I went out and I told them

03:21.920 --> 03:23.560
“Now she is sitting there. Why…

03:23.760 --> 03:27.000
why don’t you call her to sit in her seat?”

03:27.160 --> 03:28.240
“Is she the wife?”

03:28.440 --> 03:32.400
I said, “Yes, of course, she is the wife.”

03:32.600 --> 03:35.320
“We thought she was some secretary.”

03:35.520 --> 03:37.240
I said, “What made you think?”

03:37.440 --> 03:40.440
This lady had, you see, very modern ideas -

03:40.640 --> 03:45.600
wearing a very modern slick dress and all that and

03:45.800 --> 03:47.120
and everybody thought

03:47.320 --> 03:50.120
this lady must be the secretary at the most.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.360
So they made her sit in the waiting room.

03:53.560 --> 03:58.240
You see - So it is expected of a housewife

03:58.440 --> 04:02.440
to be decently dressed, honorably dressed

04:02.640 --> 04:05.920
and not to dress up like a secretary

04:06.120 --> 04:11.560
or somebody who is just in the office.

04:11.760 --> 04:14.760
Because she is regarded as the highest -

04:15.000 --> 04:17.320
whether you like it or not.

04:17.520 --> 04:20.360
But she had permed her hair

04:20.560 --> 04:23.200
and she has been to a very expensive place

04:23.400 --> 04:26.720
for all decorations and everything.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.000
And poor thing, when she arrived

04:29.200 --> 04:34.800
they put her in the waiting room near the bathroom.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.240
That’s what it is.

04:38.440 --> 04:41.200
So for a housewife,

04:41.400 --> 04:44.080
she is the dignity of the household.

04:44.280 --> 04:47.320
Not only that, but she is responsible

04:47.520 --> 04:53.200
for the complete culture of that country,

04:54.680 --> 04:57.600
complete culture of that country.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.560
They represent the culture.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.680
Like in India nowadays they have started

05:04.880 --> 05:08.120
in the films showing all kinds of funny, funny dresses.

05:08.320 --> 05:11.400
But I haven’t seen any housewife wearing that.

05:11.600 --> 05:13.320
I haven’t seen anybody.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.280
It’s not in reality, it’s only in the film,

05:16.480 --> 05:19.920
because the society is so strong

05:20.120 --> 05:24.920
and the housewife is supposed to be a decent person.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.360
She has to be decent,

05:26.560 --> 05:30.680
she has to be very dignified

05:30.880 --> 05:34.640
and she has to behave in a dignified manner.

05:36.120 --> 05:37.680
On the contrary I would say,

05:37.880 --> 05:41.560
we had a prime minister called Lal Bahadur Shastri.

05:41.760 --> 05:44.720
His wife was absolutely uneducated

05:44.920 --> 05:47.120
because Shastriji went to jail

05:47.320 --> 05:49.480
and she couldn’t take her education -

05:49.680 --> 05:53.160
very simple, ordinary woman.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.880
And she went to France.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.400
That time there was this Mr. de Gaulle,

05:59.600 --> 06:01.600
he was the president.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.200
And his wife was another very simple woman.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.120
So Shastriji told her

06:07.320 --> 06:10.640
that “You are not to cry when you are leaving Mrs. de Gaulle,

06:10.840 --> 06:12.320
now you’ve become great friends.”

06:12.520 --> 06:14.240
God knows she didn’t know French

06:14.440 --> 06:16.080
and she didn’t know Hindi,

06:16.280 --> 06:19.400
but somehow both of them became great friends,

06:19.600 --> 06:22.400
on the level of housewives.

06:22.600 --> 06:28.160
And when he warned her not to cry,

06:29.320 --> 06:32.320
what happened that they started crying

06:32.520 --> 06:34.080
when they had to leave.

06:34.280 --> 06:36.680
So Shastriji said, “I told you not to cry."

06:36.880 --> 06:40.000
She said, “It is she, this French lady started crying.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.600
What can I do? I had to cry with her.”

06:43.800 --> 06:47.920
So you see, it’s a kind of a great

06:48.120 --> 06:51.000
collectivity of housewives

06:51.640 --> 06:53.200
that has to work out.

06:53.400 --> 06:56.000
They have common problems,

06:56.200 --> 06:59.160
they have to face their children,

06:59.360 --> 07:01.920
they have to look after the household,

07:02.120 --> 07:05.720
everything – I mean there are so many common problems

07:05.920 --> 07:07.920
with the housewives.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.600
And the housewife also

07:10.800 --> 07:13.280
knows all little, little things.

07:13.480 --> 07:17.000
You see, men at least in India don’t know much

07:17.160 --> 07:20.920
because they live in the air, I think.

07:21.120 --> 07:24.000
So the women have more sense

07:24.160 --> 07:27.000
in this respect, for small, small things

07:27.160 --> 07:29.200
they are quite aware.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.800
It’s very interesting sometimes,

07:34.000 --> 07:37.320
the men commit mistakes

07:37.520 --> 07:41.240
of such a great humor.

07:41.440 --> 07:45.000
Because they do not deal with day-to-day life,

07:45.200 --> 07:51.640
with all the problems of daily life.

07:51.840 --> 07:53.720
On one side the woman,

07:53.920 --> 07:57.600
housewife, has to deal with the daily life.

07:57.880 --> 08:02.040
On the other side she has to look after her family,

08:02.240 --> 08:03.880
her children.

08:04.080 --> 08:07.640
Also, poor thing, she is responsible

08:07.840 --> 08:09.840
for the society.

08:10.040 --> 08:12.880
She has to maintain the society.

08:13.080 --> 08:16.520
In a country where women are sensible

08:16.720 --> 08:19.080
and are matured,

08:19.280 --> 08:21.520
you will be amazed that they become

08:21.720 --> 08:25.000
extremely good families,

08:25.160 --> 08:27.480
good societies and good children.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.320
That’s why I must say,

08:29.520 --> 08:34.520
India is a very good country of very good society.

08:34.720 --> 08:38.440
This is come out of the housewives,

08:38.640 --> 08:41.160
the Gruha Lakshmis of the house,

08:41.360 --> 08:45.720
who have done all the work that is important

08:45.920 --> 08:48.640
as far as the culture is concerned.

08:48.840 --> 08:53.680
This kind of thing is very much in India

08:53.880 --> 08:57.520
and with that, what you find

08:57.760 --> 09:01.880
that the people respect,

09:02.600 --> 09:05.080
respect the housewives.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.280
So respecting the housewife

09:07.480 --> 09:12.760
is the most important thing in our Sahaj culture.

09:13.320 --> 09:16.120
But that doesn’t mean that

09:16.320 --> 09:21.080
the women should try to dominate and trouble

09:21.280 --> 09:24.080
and fight with the husbands.

09:24.280 --> 09:30.080
But it means a very important position

09:30.480 --> 09:33.800
in the society, of a housewife.

09:34.000 --> 09:40.560
She is treated as a something a, like a devi only.

09:40.760 --> 09:43.600
But she too has to be a devi.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.920
If you treat her like a doormat,

09:47.120 --> 09:49.920
then children will never respect her.

09:50.120 --> 09:53.680
If you don’t pay proper respect to her,

09:53.880 --> 09:57.160
the children won’t respect the mother

09:57.360 --> 09:59.440
and there will be no impact

09:59.640 --> 10:02.160
of the mother on the children.

10:02.360 --> 10:05.680
As a result the children get wayward,

10:05.880 --> 10:09.440
and in the societies or in the countries

10:09.640 --> 10:12.680
where the mother is not respected,

10:12.880 --> 10:18.000
you will find the children become extremely dominating,

10:18.200 --> 10:23.240
hot-tempered and horribly uncollective.

10:24.560 --> 10:27.000
So it’s very important that on this day

10:27.160 --> 10:30.040
we call it Dhanteras - the thirteenth day -

10:30.240 --> 10:33.840
you have to buy something for your wife,

10:34.040 --> 10:37.280
and you have to give her something as a present.

10:37.480 --> 10:42.000
At least you should buy a little pot

10:42.200 --> 10:46.360
or something that can be used in the kitchen

10:46.560 --> 10:49.120
to show your respect to her.

10:49.320 --> 10:52.560
In the families where mother is not respected

10:52.760 --> 10:56.160
children become extremely troublesome

10:56.360 --> 10:59.640
and the whole, their family also suffers -

10:59.840 --> 11:03.120
wherever they are married, whatever happens to them.

11:03.320 --> 11:06.280
Men have to realize, it is their mistake

11:06.560 --> 11:11.320
that they have never respected their wife as they should have.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.280
In the presence of the children if they shout,

11:14.480 --> 11:19.000
in the presence of the children if they don’t show any respect,

11:19.160 --> 11:23.000
the children can never respect the mother.

11:23.680 --> 11:27.480
It is something, a criminal thing to do

11:27.680 --> 11:30.520
to women who are in the household

11:30.720 --> 11:32.640
doing all the work for you,

11:32.840 --> 11:35.560
looking after you, your family,

11:35.760 --> 11:37.920
not demanding anything.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.200
Only if you want to understand

11:41.400 --> 11:43.080
how they can be troublesome,

11:43.280 --> 11:45.480
is see them in the politics.

11:45.680 --> 11:50.040
When they go in the politics they put all men upside-down.

11:50.680 --> 11:55.480
And one woman can put all of them in their proper senses.

11:55.760 --> 12:00.560
Because their field is their house, their family.

12:00.760 --> 12:03.120
If they are not respected in the family,

12:03.320 --> 12:05.280
they get out of the family

12:05.480 --> 12:09.320
and behave in such manner that you can’t imagine.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.800
Though she has to bear a lot,

12:12.000 --> 12:13.480
she has to suffer a lot,

12:13.680 --> 12:18.200
but in the family she must be respected.

12:18.400 --> 12:24.360
That’s a very, very important message of Gruha Lakshmi.

12:26.840 --> 12:30.360
Then the second day is the one where

12:30.680 --> 12:36.240
this horrible rakshasa called as Narakasura was killed.

12:36.760 --> 12:43.000
Always all killing is done with the power of the Shakti.

12:43.200 --> 12:49.240
This Narakasura was the fellow who had tortured so many people

12:49.440 --> 12:53.280
and had done lots of cunning stuff.

12:53.480 --> 12:56.080
He was a very treacherous, cunning man

12:56.280 --> 13:00.160
and it was impossible to kill him.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.120
But then somehow or other,

13:03.320 --> 13:07.080
with the advent of a special power

13:07.280 --> 13:10.120
that this Narakasura was killed.

13:10.320 --> 13:14.800
That was the another day, fourth day,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.600
where Narakasura was killed.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.280
They say that when he was killed,

13:21.480 --> 13:25.160
the door of hell was closed.

13:25.360 --> 13:29.120
So people should take their baths early in the morning.

13:29.320 --> 13:31.560
But I am of the opinion

13:31.760 --> 13:35.240
that day if the door is open, better not take bath.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.440
Be in your beds

13:38.640 --> 13:43.040
till this fellow is put fully into narak.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.000
You should not bother about him.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.000
“Naraka” means hell.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.560
And from the hell

13:50.760 --> 13:55.000
they extracted him and killed him.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.520
The last one is the best,

13:57.720 --> 14:01.720
where they have the meeting of Shri Rama

14:01.920 --> 14:04.800
and His brother Bharat.

14:05.000 --> 14:09.480
Shri Rama went to jail, obeying His father.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.360
And for fourteen years

14:11.560 --> 14:15.240
He was – not a jail but in a, we could say,

14:15.440 --> 14:17.480
He went in the forest

14:17.680 --> 14:21.240
as a - it was a kind of a jail only, because

14:21.440 --> 14:25.120
He was living in the palaces and He was sent in the

14:27.080 --> 14:28.880
forest by His father

14:29.080 --> 14:31.680
and his daughter-in-law;

14:31.880 --> 14:34.480
also I mean it’s His own wife.

14:34.680 --> 14:39.640
And also the brother, they went together

14:39.840 --> 14:42.000
into great sufferings.

14:42.200 --> 14:45.240
And you know the whole story of Ramayana.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.240
The child

14:51.360 --> 14:54.000
that lived in the palaces

14:54.200 --> 14:56.200
had to go in the forest

14:56.400 --> 15:00.000
and live in terrible conditions,

15:00.200 --> 15:03.040
when He was to be the king.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.160
Was too much.

15:05.760 --> 15:09.160
But Sita went with Him

15:09.360 --> 15:12.000
and She supported Him

15:12.160 --> 15:16.760
and ultimately it so happened that

15:19.680 --> 15:25.680
Ravana came and took away Sita.

15:25.880 --> 15:28.080
But Shri Rama fought Ravana,

15:28.280 --> 15:31.720
killed him and brought back His wife.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.800
But when they came back

15:34.000 --> 15:38.440
to their own capital in Ayodhya,

15:38.640 --> 15:40.560
there was a big jubilation

15:40.760 --> 15:43.040
and Bharat, His brother -

15:43.240 --> 15:46.440
he was very much attached to his brother

15:46.640 --> 15:49.680
and he ruled that country

15:49.880 --> 15:52.120
with the paduka -

15:52.320 --> 15:58.480
they say is the kind of sandalwood chappals

15:58.680 --> 16:01.280
they use – of his brother.

16:01.480 --> 16:05.000
He put it on the throne and ruled.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.840
So that is how the Bharat milan-

16:08.040 --> 16:10.480
the meeting of Bharat with Shri Rama-

16:10.680 --> 16:11.800
is celebrated,

16:12.000 --> 16:14.800
and that was the time He was crowned also

16:15.000 --> 16:16.320
as the king.

16:16.520 --> 16:18.000
So it is long time back,

16:18.160 --> 16:19.520
thousands of years back

16:19.720 --> 16:21.120
this thing has happened.

16:21.320 --> 16:25.240
That jubilation is very significant

16:25.440 --> 16:29.440
that the right king gets His own throne,

16:29.640 --> 16:31.600
and He rules.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.160
And all the injustice

16:33.360 --> 16:37.800
and all kind of atrocities He has gone through

16:38.000 --> 16:42.200
has to be completely finished from His life.

16:42.400 --> 16:46.120
And that’s why Diwali is important.

16:47.920 --> 16:51.920
So the last day they worship the Goddess Lakshmi.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.160
Because it is Her blessings

16:54.360 --> 16:58.400
that brought forth all these beautiful meetings.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.880
And that’s why they worship Her, Lakshmi, as such.

17:03.080 --> 17:07.680
But there are nine types of Lakshmis within us,

17:07.880 --> 17:11.160
which I think I have told you sometimes back.

17:12.040 --> 17:15.800
Now in that Lakshmi Puja is this, that

17:16.000 --> 17:18.280
you worship the Lakshmi Herself.

17:18.480 --> 17:20.320
It doesn’t mean money,

17:20.520 --> 17:21.600
not at all.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.840
To worship money is wrong.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.000
But what it means that

17:26.200 --> 17:30.480
Lakshmi is the money which is with us -

17:30.680 --> 17:33.040
or the whatever prosperity with that -

17:33.240 --> 17:35.600
should be very carefully spent,

17:35.800 --> 17:39.640
because She is very mobile

17:39.840 --> 17:41.760
and the money can slip out.

17:42.000 --> 17:46.920
On the contrary you should not be at all miserly.

17:47.120 --> 17:50.240
Miserly people – Lakshmi is not happy.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.120
But if you want to spend,

17:52.320 --> 17:54.480
you must spend it in the right way,

17:54.680 --> 17:58.920
otherwise the money is spent in the wrong way.

18:00.600 --> 18:08.480
Now when the Lakshmi was created -

18:08.680 --> 18:09.480
you must be knowing

18:09.680 --> 18:12.800
out of the churning of the sea She came out.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.680
She had four hands,

18:16.880 --> 18:20.160
one hand was to give.

18:20.680 --> 18:23.200
She is generous, She gives.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.720
Like this She gives,

18:26.920 --> 18:29.800
and with one hand She blesses.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.680
These are Her two hands.

18:31.880 --> 18:35.360
One is to give, and to bless the person.

18:36.760 --> 18:39.360
Very important it is,

18:39.560 --> 18:43.920
that when you give to somebody something,

18:44.120 --> 18:46.000
you forget about it,

18:46.360 --> 18:48.600
and you bless that person.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.320
Not only you give money,

18:50.520 --> 18:53.680
but also you bless that person.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.000
The other two hands

18:57.200 --> 19:02.200
have got two lotuses of pink color.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.320
Pink is the color of love.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.680
And a person who has money

19:09.880 --> 19:12.680
should have a house

19:12.880 --> 19:16.040
which is full of love.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.560
Any guest who comes in the house

19:18.760 --> 19:20.880
should be respected.

19:21.600 --> 19:25.880
He should be treated just like God.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.520
In India you have noticed how

19:28.720 --> 19:29.880
they think foreigners -

19:30.080 --> 19:32.000
“foreigners” means God to them.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.000
Here “foreigner” is a bad word,

19:34.200 --> 19:36.400
but in India is very respectable.

19:36.600 --> 19:37.840
If you are a foreigner

19:38.040 --> 19:40.160
means that you are God.

19:40.360 --> 19:43.720
How they have looked after you, you know that, in India.

19:43.920 --> 19:45.280
This is the reason,

19:45.480 --> 19:48.680
this is the basic culture of India

19:48.880 --> 19:51.240
that anybody who is a guest -

19:51.440 --> 19:52.520
he may be anything -

19:52.720 --> 19:53.840
if he is a guest

19:54.040 --> 19:57.120
then he is to be treated like God.

19:57.400 --> 20:01.160
In the other countries it’s just the other way round, you know.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.560
If you are a foreigner

20:03.760 --> 20:08.120
then people think it’s not even proper to talk to that person.

20:08.640 --> 20:12.440
I don’t know how the mentality is like that.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.480
But not in Sahaja Yoga.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.680
Sahaja yogis are not like that.

20:31.880 --> 20:38.120
They treat the guests very well, I’ve heard.

20:38.320 --> 20:40.080
They look after each other

20:40.320 --> 20:43.520
and they are beautifully collective.

20:44.000 --> 20:49.600
So this is what is the meaning of the lotus,

20:49.800 --> 20:52.400
is a house full of love.

20:52.600 --> 20:56.920
Like a beetle which has got even thorns,

20:57.120 --> 21:01.240
when it comes to the lotus, the lotus open out

21:01.440 --> 21:03.080
and the beetle goes inside

21:03.280 --> 21:07.280
and sleeps very nicely and comfortably.

21:07.840 --> 21:10.920
Even the beetle - undisturbed.

21:11.120 --> 21:14.920
That is how one should treat, if you have money.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.480
But here what I find

21:17.680 --> 21:19.920
in the world now, if you have money

21:20.120 --> 21:22.920
you become yourself like a beetle.

21:23.200 --> 21:26.680
They’re so full of thorns and horrible ideas,

21:26.880 --> 21:30.680
so insulting, and think no end of yourself.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.000
It’s just surprising is

21:33.160 --> 21:35.480
that money which should give them

21:35.680 --> 21:39.440
the form of Lakshmi

21:39.640 --> 21:41.000
- Lakshmi Swarupa -

21:41.200 --> 21:43.200
they become like devils.

21:43.400 --> 21:48.200
And the way they treat other people is even worse than that.

21:49.280 --> 21:53.680
So these are the significance of the form of the Goddess.

21:53.880 --> 21:57.240
But the best is, She’s just standing on the lotus.

21:57.440 --> 22:00.280
That means no pressure on anyone.

22:00.480 --> 22:03.240
She exists on Her own - no pressure.

22:03.440 --> 22:07.560
She doesn’t put any pressure on anyone,

22:07.760 --> 22:10.040
just on Her own She stands

22:10.240 --> 22:16.680
and all Her weight and all balanced on Her own dignity.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.480
This is the way a Lakshmi should be.

22:20.680 --> 22:23.720
And that’s how, if it is, when happens

22:23.920 --> 22:27.480
in the countries where people are having now financial crisis

22:27.680 --> 22:31.840
and all kinds of crisis, things will improve.

22:32.040 --> 22:36.200
People will enjoy. They don’t enjoy their money, nothing.

22:36.480 --> 22:40.280
They don’t enjoy. This is just aggressiveness

22:40.520 --> 22:42.720
and also funny ideas

22:42.920 --> 22:48.160
of having a, something, very expensive things

22:48.360 --> 22:53.280
and what you call the designers.

22:53.480 --> 22:57.440
Now I think these are designers are anti-Lakshmi,

22:57.640 --> 22:59.160
that they have come.

22:59.360 --> 23:03.000
Because they are extracting all your money nicely

23:03.200 --> 23:06.120
and all your money goes to waste.

23:06.320 --> 23:12.080
If not that, then people take to womanizing or to drinking -

23:12.280 --> 23:14.040
such wasteful habits.

23:14.240 --> 23:17.400
They don’t do anything which we can call as

23:17.600 --> 23:20.320
really the blessing of the Lakshmi.

23:20.840 --> 23:23.520
So one has to remember

23:23.720 --> 23:27.280
that when you want to give something to someone

23:27.480 --> 23:30.280
do it with the full heart.

23:30.480 --> 23:32.480
Such full heart that

23:32.680 --> 23:36.200
it forms that Lakshmi Prasada.

23:36.520 --> 23:38.680
You see, that should happen, otherwise

23:38.880 --> 23:42.480
what’s the use of giving presents to anyone?

23:42.680 --> 23:45.440
You see, they are very funny people, you know

23:45.640 --> 23:51.080
who give presents out of a very narrow outlook.

23:52.480 --> 23:56.160
But they try to give presents.

23:56.360 --> 23:58.200
Like in Japan, if you go,

23:58.400 --> 24:00.480
they’ll give you such a big present.

24:00.680 --> 24:04.680
You go on opening and opening and opening and opening it,

24:04.880 --> 24:09.280
till you come to a point when you’ll get a matchbox.

24:09.480 --> 24:12.000
In the matchbox - inside the matchbox,

24:12.200 --> 24:16.120
you will take two,

24:17.840 --> 24:21.560
you can say, it’s two doll-like things made out of

24:21.760 --> 24:24.320
small little those matchsticks.

24:24.520 --> 24:25.680
Start looking at them

24:25.880 --> 24:30.640
“What this is, why such a big design?”

24:30.840 --> 24:33.640
and very surprising.

24:33.920 --> 24:37.400
But they are very simple people otherwise, very simple.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.800
When we went there, they told us

24:41.480 --> 24:46.160
they – wherever we went, you know even in a shop when it was raining

24:46.400 --> 24:47.840
they would give us a present.

24:48.040 --> 24:49.360
Now I said, “What is this?

24:49.560 --> 24:52.280
Why are they giving us a present like this?”

24:52.480 --> 24:55.360
So the lady who was translating, she said

24:55.560 --> 24:57.920
“They think You are from a royal family.”

24:58.120 --> 25:01.600
I said, “What makes them feel we are from a royal family?”

25:01.800 --> 25:04.680
“Because You don’t go to hairdresser.”

25:04.880 --> 25:06.000
I said, “Really?”

25:06.160 --> 25:11.800
“Yes. In Japan, royal family people never go to a hairdresser.”

25:12.000 --> 25:16.120
I said, “I didn’t know this, that they don’t go to the hairdresser.”

25:16.360 --> 25:19.720
“That’s why they think, You are from the royal family.”

25:19.920 --> 25:24.840
Just imagine what ideas people have about

25:28.000 --> 25:30.600
hairdressing and all that.

25:30.800 --> 25:33.920
But in India or these places

25:34.120 --> 25:38.440
a woman must be properly combed - her hair.

25:38.640 --> 25:41.480
She shouldn’t look like a hippie going round, you know.

25:41.680 --> 25:45.440
Because we have many people who

25:45.640 --> 25:48.120
still believe in a kind of a hippieism

25:48.320 --> 25:52.000
and they wear their hairdress like that.

25:52.200 --> 25:56.680
Now, woman plays a very big part in the society as I told you.

25:56.880 --> 26:00.720
Whatever way she wears, whatever where she goes about,

26:00.920 --> 26:03.200
also the children pick up much more

26:03.400 --> 26:06.160
then from the mother than from the father.

26:06.360 --> 26:09.200
Sometimes could be much more from the father also.

26:09.400 --> 26:12.840
But actually the, all the refined things

26:13.040 --> 26:15.320
are picked up from the mother.

26:15.520 --> 26:18.760
So it is more for the ladies

26:19.000 --> 26:22.880
to understand how they dress up, how they live.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.560
Nowadays – I went to London

26:25.760 --> 26:28.000
and I’ve asked one Indian Sahaja yogini

26:28.160 --> 26:29.920
“What is the fashion now?”

26:30.120 --> 26:32.560
So she said “jipreya” in Marathi.

26:32.760 --> 26:35.760
“Jipreya” means if you put your hair like this is.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.200
See in India, if we have hair like this

26:38.400 --> 26:41.320
the mother will say “Now remove your jipreyas.”

26:41.520 --> 26:46.440
Because if you put like that hair your eyes can become squinty.

26:46.920 --> 26:49.840
But that’s the fashion to put the hair like this, you see -

26:50.040 --> 26:52.680
very much, sometimes on the eyes also.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.800
So that’s a jipreya fashion.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.400
And this now is quite common I find everybody

26:58.600 --> 27:00.720
dignified ladies also,

27:00.920 --> 27:02.640
except for Mrs. Thatcher,

27:02.840 --> 27:05.360
everybody puts on this kind of a thing.

27:05.560 --> 27:09.040
I don’t know how Mrs. Thatcher has escaped it.

27:09.280 --> 27:12.080
But anybody who does anything

27:12.280 --> 27:14.400
that should not be followed by women.

27:14.600 --> 27:15.920
It’s very slavish.

27:16.120 --> 27:18.600
Because this is the fashion, that’s why they do it.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.880
That’s the fashion, so they do it.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.640
It’s absolutely stupid to do that way

27:23.840 --> 27:27.120
and to play into the hands of these people who make fashions.

27:27.360 --> 27:29.440
Because you are independent.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.640
You must stand on your own character.

27:31.840 --> 27:34.640
you must stand on your own understanding of things.

27:34.840 --> 27:37.520
Instead of ruining your faces

27:37.720 --> 27:40.280
you should try to improve them

27:40.480 --> 27:43.920
by your dignity, by your

27:45.400 --> 27:47.440
understanding.

27:47.640 --> 27:51.480
Now it’s more on the women - I am sorry to say -

27:51.680 --> 27:54.440
Lakshmi Puja is more on the women

27:54.640 --> 27:56.400
that what they have to understand,

27:56.600 --> 28:00.080
what they have to be, how they should be.

28:00.920 --> 28:04.480
I have always told you

28:04.680 --> 28:09.120
that it’s necessary for a woman to be dignified,

28:09.320 --> 28:11.680
very much more than the man.

28:11.880 --> 28:14.600
Man can be stupid – doesn’t matter, you see,

28:14.800 --> 28:16.120
doesn’t matter so much.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.560
But women have to be dignified and sensible.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.680
And men, as it is, don’t know much

28:21.880 --> 28:23.360
as you know that very well.

28:23.560 --> 28:24.640
Poor things, you know,

28:24.840 --> 28:26.720
they are

28:30.200 --> 28:34.000
They are educated only in the universities.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.840
But as far as the practical side is concerned,

28:37.040 --> 28:38.840
they don’t know anything.

28:39.040 --> 28:45.480
So one should not feel bad about it.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.240
I mean, it’s very enjoyable

28:47.440 --> 28:49.840
to see the way men make mistake and

28:50.040 --> 28:52.520
then they go on saying “No, no, I know this, I know that,”

28:52.720 --> 28:54.760
and they don’t know anything!

28:58.760 --> 29:03.720
So - But man will never say, “I don’t know.”

29:03.920 --> 29:05.160
You see, that’s his character.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.880
It’s all right.

29:07.080 --> 29:09.560
You must know that he doesn’t mean it,

29:09.760 --> 29:12.520
because he really doesn’t know anything!

29:23.000 --> 29:25.720
Also in art.

29:26.120 --> 29:29.760
I don’t think men know much about art,

29:30.000 --> 29:37.280
and also their one side is missing is aesthetics.

29:37.720 --> 29:41.000
Poor things, they make one type of clothes

29:41.200 --> 29:43.280
wear all throughout.

29:43.640 --> 29:47.480
Just one type of dresses they will make

29:47.680 --> 29:50.800
and that they will make and wear throughout.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.720
They don’t have any demand.

29:52.920 --> 29:55.680
But women are artistic.

29:55.880 --> 30:00.400
And if our Indian women give up wearing saris

30:00.600 --> 30:04.000
and take to jeans, where will the villagers go?

30:04.200 --> 30:06.800
Because they live with their saris that they make

30:07.000 --> 30:09.640
during holidays and things like that.

30:09.840 --> 30:13.160
So in India is not possible to introduce

30:13.360 --> 30:15.440
all these dresses.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.200
In the school maybe,

30:17.400 --> 30:21.160
but later on they all give up, because they like saris.

30:21.360 --> 30:23.720
So the saris are still on

30:23.920 --> 30:27.360
and will be on because it’s so artistic,

30:27.560 --> 30:28.840
it’s so beautiful.

30:29.040 --> 30:32.000
One sari doesn’t look like another sari.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.560
So the idea of beauty and the idea of art

30:35.760 --> 30:38.920
much more with the women, not with the men.

30:39.120 --> 30:42.000
And so one should see that

30:42.200 --> 30:44.080
if men don’t know, doesn’t matter.

30:44.280 --> 30:50.680
But you make your houses absolutely artistic.

30:50.880 --> 30:55.720
Make it comfortable like the lotus, as I said,

30:56.000 --> 30:57.280
that should be such.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.480
But some of the ladies

30:59.680 --> 31:03.800
can be very much like a Hitler, you know,

31:04.000 --> 31:06.240
in the household, very dictating.

31:06.440 --> 31:09.080
“This should be like this, that should be like that,”

31:09.280 --> 31:13.360
making the life of men absolutely miserable.

31:13.560 --> 31:15.000
I have known a person

31:15.200 --> 31:19.040
who used to carry a newspaper in his house.

31:19.240 --> 31:21.280
So I said, “Why do you carry it all the time?”

31:21.480 --> 31:22.600
He said, “Whenever I sit,

31:22.800 --> 31:25.920
I put the newspaper first and then I sit.”

31:26.120 --> 31:26.680
“Why?”

31:26.880 --> 31:30.400
“Because if it is spoilt a little bit

31:30.600 --> 31:32.800
my wife will shout at me.”

31:33.000 --> 31:34.200
I said, “Why?”

31:34.400 --> 31:38.360
“Because she doesn’t like anything to be spoilt.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.040
So she’s so particular.

31:40.240 --> 31:42.880
I carry a newspaper always with me -

31:43.080 --> 31:45.600
wherever I have to sit I put the newspaper."

31:45.800 --> 31:47.440
I said, “It’s too much.”

31:47.640 --> 31:52.200
He said, “You will also have to do that, I tell You.”

31:56.800 --> 32:03.480
So very particular about the whole house

32:03.680 --> 32:07.320
that it’s impossible to live in that house.

32:07.520 --> 32:10.320
It’s even worse than a hospital.

32:10.520 --> 32:14.160
So some women can be very particular about that

32:14.360 --> 32:17.840
and very methodical, could be.

32:18.440 --> 32:23.120
But normally women should be very loving

32:23.320 --> 32:26.360
and extremely accommodating,

32:26.560 --> 32:31.360
and also being friendly with all the family members,

32:31.560 --> 32:33.400
with everyone.

32:33.640 --> 32:38.480
It’s very important that I’ve a family so big.

32:38.680 --> 32:41.120
We have a very large family,

32:41.320 --> 32:43.880
so many brothers and sisters

32:44.080 --> 32:48.120
and everybody one better than the other.

32:48.320 --> 32:51.680
It is so remarkable that

32:52.000 --> 32:57.000
everybody has a different type of a perfume, I think,

32:57.200 --> 32:59.560
or a kind of a fragrance

32:59.760 --> 33:03.280
that shows an individual personality in them.

33:03.480 --> 33:07.360
Despite that they are all so nice and so good,

33:07.560 --> 33:10.920
so accommodating and so much enjoying,

33:11.120 --> 33:15.160
that it’s remarkable how people live together.

33:15.360 --> 33:19.840
Specially in Russia I found the women are very adaptable

33:20.080 --> 33:21.560
and very humorous.

33:21.760 --> 33:25.200
And they were making fun of everything

33:25.400 --> 33:27.800
and enjoying life.

33:28.480 --> 33:32.240
Very surprising, we had taken presents for them.

33:32.440 --> 33:35.160
But we had taken for about two thousand people,

33:35.360 --> 33:38.200
but there were sixteen thousand people.

33:38.400 --> 33:41.880
So how could we give these presents?

33:42.080 --> 33:44.440
So the women took out their chains

33:44.640 --> 33:47.120
and they said, “All right, we’ll give it to men, all right.

33:47.320 --> 33:50.920
We’ll give them our ear-tops, all right,”

33:51.120 --> 33:53.080
and they were making fun of men,

33:53.280 --> 33:56.240
who were feeling bad that they couldn’t get anything.

33:56.440 --> 34:00.280
Such fun, you know, such understanding.

34:00.480 --> 34:03.560
Because they are not so money-oriented I think

34:03.760 --> 34:08.400
and they are very spiritual-minded.

34:08.600 --> 34:12.560
So a spiritual woman wouldn’t bother about other things like this

34:12.760 --> 34:15.320
and will keep a dignity of her own

34:15.520 --> 34:19.360
and will show by her every gesture

34:19.560 --> 34:21.400
that she is spiritual.

34:21.600 --> 34:25.320
This is something so sweet, you know.

34:25.520 --> 34:28.000
As I was telling you, on one side

34:28.240 --> 34:30.120
sometimes you feel

34:32.440 --> 34:36.320
a little different, say, I said it about Japan.

34:36.520 --> 34:39.680
But in the same Japan when I went there,

34:39.880 --> 34:42.600
I liked their tiles very much.

34:43.400 --> 34:46.280
So they were building up something,

34:46.480 --> 34:48.680
I liked the design of their tiles.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.480
So I said, “Can I take one from here?”

34:51.680 --> 34:56.760
“No, no, doesn’t matter. We’ll send it to Your ship.”

34:57.000 --> 35:00.240
And on the ship a big load

35:00.440 --> 35:02.640
of those tiles arrived.

35:02.840 --> 35:05.120
And the captain asked Me, “Now what are we to do?”

35:05.320 --> 35:06.680
I said, “How did you get it?”

35:06.880 --> 35:08.440
He said, “They brought it to You.”

35:08.640 --> 35:12.920
All kinds of varieties of those tiles,

35:13.120 --> 35:14.760
can you imagine?

35:15.000 --> 35:17.040
So on one side it is

35:17.240 --> 35:20.320
a way of expression,

35:20.520 --> 35:23.600
on the other side is different.

35:23.800 --> 35:26.320
So one should understand also.

35:26.520 --> 35:29.240
When somebody gives you something

35:29.440 --> 35:31.200
you should understand

35:31.400 --> 35:36.000
what is the significance of that,

35:36.160 --> 35:38.320
and not to feel bad about it.

35:38.520 --> 35:42.560
The significance of that could be very much great,

35:42.760 --> 35:44.320
you may not understand.

35:44.520 --> 35:48.520
So better to ask, why they have given you these things.

35:48.720 --> 35:51.920
That is what is, what we call auspiciousness,

35:52.120 --> 35:55.440
one of the great qualities of the Lakshmi is,

35:55.640 --> 35:58.800
that it should be auspicious.

35:59.320 --> 36:03.240
Whatever you give should be auspicious.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.160
Like sometimes

36:05.360 --> 36:07.760
I have seen little children out of mischief

36:08.000 --> 36:11.000
will bring a lizard and try to give you.

36:11.160 --> 36:13.520
I mean, it’s very inauspicious to do that.

36:13.720 --> 36:16.440
But they are not told that it’s inauspicious,

36:16.640 --> 36:18.160
so they are doing like that.

36:18.360 --> 36:20.280
They have to be told it’s not auspicious,

36:20.480 --> 36:22.440
it will not please the Goddess.

36:22.640 --> 36:25.080
So that has to be understood very well

36:25.280 --> 36:28.920
that you should not try to insult

36:29.120 --> 36:33.080
the Lakshmi by giving something which is wrong.

36:33.280 --> 36:35.520
If you don’t know, you should find out

36:35.720 --> 36:37.760
and do it properly.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.560
In this way this is the Diwali thing.

36:41.760 --> 36:45.000
But the greatest message of this is

36:45.200 --> 36:51.080
that the kingdom was given to Shri Rama.

36:51.280 --> 36:56.920
Shri Rama was the embodiment of justice

36:57.120 --> 36:59.200
and fair play.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.840
And this was given to Him.

37:02.040 --> 37:05.120
In the same way we have to feel

37:05.320 --> 37:11.720
that our expression of gratitude,

37:11.920 --> 37:18.880
our expression of love should be such that it should be

37:19.080 --> 37:23.400
given to a person who is a symbol

37:23.600 --> 37:26.640
of such greatness like Shri Ram.

37:27.680 --> 37:32.200
It’s a very, very subtle thing one should try to understand.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.320
If you don’t want to give, you should not give.

37:34.520 --> 37:37.800
But if you want to give, then you must give something

37:38.000 --> 37:41.840
which is worth the person to whom you are giving.

37:42.400 --> 37:45.200
That is one of the lessons you should have

37:45.400 --> 37:51.880
about Shri Rama’s temperament.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.720
When He went into the village

37:54.920 --> 37:57.680
and He found there was an old woman

37:57.880 --> 38:03.600
and this old woman had all her teeth out practically.

38:03.800 --> 38:07.680
And she was from the aboriginal

38:07.880 --> 38:11.440
and she gave Him some

38:13.160 --> 38:17.320
we call them “ber” - is something like

38:20.120 --> 38:23.320
is a kind of a fruit, small fruits.

38:23.520 --> 38:27.880
And she said, “See, I have tasted all of them

38:28.080 --> 38:31.000
and all of them are very sweet.

38:31.160 --> 38:35.320
Because You should not have something which is not sweet.

38:35.520 --> 38:37.280
So I have tasted them with my tooth,

38:37.480 --> 38:41.080
I have put my tooth on to them and I have tasted it.

38:41.280 --> 38:43.200
So please have them.”

38:43.400 --> 38:45.000
Immediately He took it.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.680
But His brother Lakshmana got very angry

38:47.880 --> 38:50.360
that it’s very inauspicious in India,

38:50.560 --> 38:52.640
if you have put something in the mouth

38:52.840 --> 38:54.680
and then you want to give to somebody

38:54.880 --> 38:58.160
is something [utishta ? ] – is not to be done.

39:00.680 --> 39:01.760
But Shri Rama said

39:02.000 --> 39:04.880
“I have never eaten such beautiful fruits.

39:05.080 --> 39:08.120
They are the most beautiful fruits I have eaten.”

39:08.320 --> 39:09.440
So His wife says

39:09.640 --> 39:13.640
“Also give Me some. After all, I am Your half

39:13.840 --> 39:16.240
this thing, You must give Me.”

39:17.240 --> 39:19.760
So Shri Rama gave Her some.

39:20.400 --> 39:23.880
She said, “Wow, what a thing it is, tremendous.”

39:24.080 --> 39:28.160
She ate it and then the Lakshmana says

39:28.360 --> 39:30.400
“Give me also, sister-in-law.”

39:30.600 --> 39:32.480
She said, “Just now you were saying

39:32.680 --> 39:34.600
all kinds of things against this lady.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.200
Why do you want to have it?”

39:36.400 --> 39:39.320
He said, “Now please forgive me and give me.”

39:39.520 --> 39:42.520
So, see, it shows

39:42.720 --> 39:45.720
that Shri Rama could see her love,

39:45.920 --> 39:49.920
her vibrations in those fruits

39:50.120 --> 39:52.000
that she had offered.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.360
And He could appreciate

39:54.560 --> 39:57.880
to that extent that He gave it to His wife

39:58.080 --> 40:01.320
and the wife also joined hands with Him.

40:01.520 --> 40:02.880
This is what it is.

40:03.080 --> 40:06.440
That whatever you do, you do it with love.

40:06.640 --> 40:08.440
If you do it with love,

40:08.640 --> 40:12.480
you will be able to make it auspicious.

40:12.680 --> 40:17.920
But if there’s no love, you are just doing for some purpose,

40:18.120 --> 40:20.040
then it is useless.

40:20.240 --> 40:26.040
So this is what is there for giving; giving to the

40:28.720 --> 40:31.360
person like Shri Ram,

40:32.120 --> 40:36.520
and to such a great incarnation.

40:37.760 --> 40:40.400
She just thought of her love

40:40.600 --> 40:42.640
and she gave it to Him.

40:42.840 --> 40:46.440
In the same way you have to be very simple,

40:46.640 --> 40:51.880
simple-hearted, and then you will know what is the best to be done.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.880
So today is, actually the Diwali is over

40:57.080 --> 41:00.440
and I want to wish you again and again a happy Diwali

41:00.640 --> 41:03.080
and a very prosperous new year.

41:03.280 --> 41:07.480
May God bless you all.

41:50.520 --> 41:53.680
The same Lakshmi becomes Mahalakshmi.

41:53.880 --> 41:57.600
That is, when you understand

41:59.560 --> 42:02.080
the value of money

42:04.520 --> 42:07.280
and when you are saturated

42:08.120 --> 42:10.880
and you are fed up.

42:11.080 --> 42:14.200
From inside you get detached,

42:14.400 --> 42:20.080
then a new form of Lakshmi comes forward,

42:20.280 --> 42:22.880
that is Mahalakshmi.

42:23.080 --> 42:27.040
That’s the power which takes you higher and higher,

42:27.240 --> 42:30.080
which is the spiritual awakening.

42:30.280 --> 42:34.800
You have seen in all the countries which are very rich,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.800
this desire started

42:38.000 --> 42:42.600
that they should seek the truth, they should find out the truth

42:42.800 --> 42:45.320
and that’s how you are all here.

42:45.520 --> 42:50.000
That means Mahalakshmi Power started working in you,

42:50.160 --> 42:52.640
that you were seeking the truth.

42:52.840 --> 42:56.600
And while seeking the truth you came to Sahaja Yoga.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.600
So this Mahalakshmi

42:58.800 --> 43:01.560
is very important for you also.

43:01.760 --> 43:06.200
And you know Kolhapur, there’s a temple of this Mahalakshmi

43:06.400 --> 43:09.280
which came out of the Mother Earth.

43:09.480 --> 43:12.680
But they themselves didn’t know that

43:12.880 --> 43:19.320
in that temple why they sang “Jogawa,” which said that

43:19.520 --> 43:22.320
“O Ambe, awaken.”

43:22.520 --> 43:24.280
