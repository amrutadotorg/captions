00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.300
Okay, so this is our fourth and final session of Sari stories. And we're going to start

2
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:25.800
with Rosalind's Sari story, and then there'll be a little bit of a hiatus while I switch

3
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.000
everything around for Gary's Sari story. Okay, Rosalind.

4
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.200
Okay, well, I've just been looking through some old diaries to try and find the date of this and

5
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.840
I cannot sort of pin the date. So other yoginis might remember when it was, it was India tour.

6
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.560
Both of the stories, they're very, very short, were on India tours, it could have been my first

7
00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:01.520
India tour actually, 89, 90. And we, Shri Mataji very kindly allowed us to go to Protestant, and we

8
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:09.280
stayed overnight there. I don't know if anyone remembers this, whether Danny was there. And I

9
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.760
think it was the year that Shri Mataji, the Italians had brought some pasta. And everybody was

10
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:24.000
a little bit fed up with the tour food and pasta came and everybody was very cheerful about that.

11
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But anyway, I'd put my name down on the marriage list. I was very nervous about it. But they told

12
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.120
me, all I could go on was what yogis told me how things go. And they told me that you need this

13
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:47.080
certain amount of money if you're going to get married. So I duly took out a lot of money in

14
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:57.200
England and changed it at the airport into rupees. And I have this sort of large in my bag,

15
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.440
wandering around India, you know, thinking, you know, worrying about this money, you need this

16
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.320
money to pay for the marriage or you might have to pay for the marriage. Anyway, when we got to

17
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:17.400
practice that Shri Mataji had all of these beautiful, beautiful saris brought into, well,

18
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:26.360
they were outside on tables in the garden. So can you hear me Caroline, because some, some things

19
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:37.720
just come up on my screen. I can hear you fine. Okay. Just came up about Spanish on my screen. And

20
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.120
we were looking to see the saris, we were able to choose a sari and I saw one that I really liked.

21
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:52.400
It was a dark, almost like a midnight blue thing. It had silver stars and things on it. I really, I

22
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.880
love this sari. And I, you know, once I've got my eye on that one, I couldn't really forget about

23
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.320
it. But I kept thinking about this money and the marriage. And I thought, you know, I didn't know

24
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:10.880
what to do. It was, I was very new. I mean, that was, I was only been in Sahaja about 18 months.

25
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.120
And that was my first time in India. So I didn't really know how things worked. Anyway, I must have

26
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:25.720
decided not to go for the sari and to save the money in case I got married. Then I saw over the

27
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.800
next few days or the next puja that we had, I saw one of the other English girls had bought this

28
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:38.240
sari and was wiring it to the pojo. So you can imagine how I felt. And I didn't get the sari and I

29
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:46.880
didn't get a husband either. So it was a big lesson in, in being, you know, surrendered, but of

30
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.720
course, I didn't really know about surrender then. So, so all of the other stories on saris, people

31
00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.120
have been able to show either a picture or the actual sari and I can't because I never got that

32
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.040
sari. So it was a bit sad. It's funny how you remember things like that, though, because it was

33
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.600
a real lesson to just live in the moment really and go for, you know, whatever was being put in

34
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.760
front of you. That's the thing to do. So that was that. And then there's only one other very short

35
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.280
story and again on an India tour. And it's not really about a sari but it's about Punjabi suit.

36
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.440
And again, I think he, I don't know whether it was that same tour, and Sramath Ji had taken us all

37
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.840
to the theatre. And all I had in mind was I wanted to have a Punjabi suit. I'd seen other girls in

38
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.960
them and, you know, I really liked them and thought they looked very comfortable. And I just

39
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.520
again, I was very attached, I couldn't get my mind off wanting a Punjabi suit. And we hadn't been

40
00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.600
anywhere to buy anything until this one day. And we were near a town, I can't really remember where

41
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:08.040
it was. That's why I've been trying to look in my diaries for the date. And another yogini from

42
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.600
Germany said she'd come with me. And she came with me and I tried one on and I'm very tall and quite

43
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:22.200
broad shoulders. So not all of them fit me very well. This one did. And I bought it. I asked her

44
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:29.480
opinion and she said it's okay. And then I wore it that night, or one night for the theatre. And I

45
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.280
just happened to be, I didn't really mean it to happen, but I just happened to be right at the

46
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:43.640
side where Sramath Ji was walking out when we'd finished the play at the theatre. And she just

47
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:52.440
looked at me and very, very firmly, I mean really firmly said, children's clothes, she said directly

48
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.480
at me, and then turned away to the rest of the collective and said, oh, you can buy them in

49
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.920
such and such a place, you know, you can buy children's clothes. And it was quite a shock,

50
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.600
because she looked directly at me and said, very firmly, children's clothes. And I thought

51
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.440
afterwards, it took me a while to understand. But I thought afterwards that she was telling me, no,

52
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:21.640
that's not the right thing to wear. And now I know about things. It was actually quite a very young

53
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:28.200
Punjab, it wasn't really suitable for me. So that was, you know, so obviously, I was,

54
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.800
I should have had a sari on really. That's it, really, those are my two very short stories.

55
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.200
Well, they're both lovely. And, and just so

56
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.800
emblematic, I think is what I'm looking for, of these things that happened to us,

57
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.480
that we really recognise as lessons, especially, I think, in the early days,

58
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.400
when it's all when we're changing so much so quickly, and we and and these incidents happen,

59
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.200
and we know that they are specifically happening, so that we'll learn something from them.

60
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:08.680
Yes, exactly. That's exactly right. I thought that they did, I knew even then,

61
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.160
they were happening to teach me something, but it's a bit of a blur, you know, you're not quite

62
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:18.920
sure at the time, but of course, you know, you learn later. Very funny.

63
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:27.880
Thank you very much, Rosalind. I'm going to remove the pin from you. And Gary,

64
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.000
you switch your camera on, please, my dear.

65
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:39.640
So here I am.

66
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:46.040
Yeah, lovely. And now you're pinned also for the recording, which is continuing. So I've got these

67
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.680
images lined up. So just let me know when to put them up.

68
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:58.680
Okay. Well, I'll introduce myself for the people who don't know me. I'm Gary, originally from

69
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:06.440
Australia. And I got my realisation in 1981 in Australia. And I've been living in Austria now

70
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:12.360
for the last 40 years, married to Hamid Mirani, which you probably quite a few of them probably

71
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:20.760
know Hamid. My stories are varied. Initially, when we went on the first India tours,

72
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:29.640
Sharmataji was giving out saris to all of the women on the tour. And it was such a joy to know,

73
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.120
to wonder what colour you were going to get. There was always this red one or a blue one or a green

74
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:42.520
one. And they were the first saris we were ever given in 1981. I've got one sari here.

75
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:55.720
I don't know what that is there. Okay. And this one was I think from 1982. So it's a good 42 years

76
00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:03.000
old, this sari. And it's still in very, very good condition. As you can see, it's a cotton sari. And

77
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:09.960
we were allowed to bow down to Sharmataji's feet. And then she gave us the saris personally. So it

78
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:16.120
really has still very nice vibrations, even though it's such an old sari, which I haven't worn for a

79
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:25.560
long time. But it's this pure cotton, really lovely sari. The main story that I'm going to say today

80
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:35.640
is about how I actually got my name Gauri. In 1988, as many of you know, there were nine nights

81
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:43.800
of the Devi. It was celebrated in Pune. And my husband was working in Pratastan. He went there

82
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:50.760
for at least five years, consecutive years. And in 1988, we decided we would go with him.

83
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.240
A nine month old baby and a three year old little girl, two little girls.

84
00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:02.600
So we boarded the plane and we landed in Bombay. And Hamid, because he was doing work in the garden

85
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:09.320
while we were there, he'd taken a lot of seeds and earth and different things from Austria that

86
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:17.000
probably were not really allowed to be imported into India. But he just bought them all and

87
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.680
surrendered. But when we got to the airport, the lady said, look, I'm sorry, but you'll have to go

88
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:30.440
into quarantine. It was two o'clock in the morning. And here's the two little kids there. And I

89
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:37.320
thought, how are we going to do this? So, bhandans, bhandans. And suddenly a lady came out of the blue

90
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:43.000
with a white sari on and she looked at the little girls and she said, don't worry. She said, you can

91
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.400
just go straight through. Don't tell anybody. Don't look anything. Just go straight through.

92
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:54.120
And she said to Hamid, now you go and plant your garden. Don't worry. So we got into Bombay. And

93
00:10:54.120 --> 00:11:03.320
then next day we went to Pune and we were staying with a family there. And Hamid was working at the

94
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.840
garden every day and going each day to the pujas. And he was able to do the whole nine pujas.

95
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:16.760
In the course of this time, I received a sari through Hamid. And Caroline, you can put up the

96
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:27.960
photo of Sumerji writing my name, if you wouldn't mind. Hello?

97
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.720
Yeah, just have one moment's patience with me.

98
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:41.480
Yeah, okay. Anyway, in the meantime, before she puts it up, Sumerji gave a sari to me. And

99
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:49.080
she said to Hamid, what's your wife's name? And he said, Glenda. And she said, that's not a good

100
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:56.520
name. That means lady from the valley or lady from the glen. And she should be more from the

101
00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:03.080
mountain. And gauri means white or snow or up in the mountains, Sripavati. And she said,

102
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:13.640
and Sri Shiva. So she gave me the name Gauri. And that was how I got my name. But not directly from

103
00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.680
Sumerji, through Hamid actually. And this is the sari. I don't know whether I can…

104
00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.000
Yes, just let me stop sharing the picture.

105
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.520
Yeah, you can actually put the other sari up. Maybe it's better than if I show it like this.

106
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.640
But this is my Gauri sari, I call it.

107
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.680
Yeah, I'll share a picture also.

108
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:46.700
There.

109
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:54.200
Yeah, that's it. And I mean, it's very old now. And I've worn it a few times. So it's not in

110
00:12:54.200 --> 00:13:00.520
the best condition. But it's still a very precious sari naturally. And we were

111
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:09.160
at the puja actually. The puja was on the 16th of October, as far as I remember, in Pune. And

112
00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:16.440
I was actually allowed to go up on the stage and do the puja. But at the time I was feeding my

113
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:24.520
child, the little one. And suddenly my name was called Hamid's wife. And so I had to kind of

114
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:34.600
quickly button my blowers up and walk all the way up to the stage. And Daya came up with me.

115
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:40.280
And she wasn't supposed to. But she came throttling up in her little sari, which was so cute

116
00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:45.480
actually. She was only three. And she ended up actually doing the whole puja. She was so

117
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:52.360
enthralled by her because she was being so good that she was offering the bracelets and she was

118
00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:58.440
offering the perfume. And it was a very, very powerful puja. You can imagine it's an Abaratri

119
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:07.080
puja. And it was really, really special. And afterwards, when we got back home,

120
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:14.600
Sharmataji invited us to Protestant. And so we went and we were in a private room with Sharmataji.

121
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:21.320
And she was saying to me, I don't know how to pay Hamid for all the work he's been doing

122
00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:29.560
in Protestant in the garden. And she was looking right at me, you know. And somehow inside of my

123
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:37.720
head was, he always wanted a son. This was somehow in my head. And then Sharmataji looked at me very,

124
00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:45.960
very knowingly, let's say. And I was sitting there and I was thinking, oh yes, okay.

125
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:50.760
And then when we got to Australia, because we went to Australia after India,

126
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:57.000
and then afterwards Sharmataji invited us back for Ganapati Pule.

127
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.000
And in Australia, I felt very tired. I wasn't feeling very well at all.

128
00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:12.280
I was still breastfeeding my daughter, the middle daughter. And we got to Ganapati Pule and

129
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:18.920
I didn't feel well at all. And I thought, gosh, I hope I'm not pregnant again.

130
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:28.040
Anyway, I got back to Austria and I was. And later on, about a year after this,

131
00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:34.840
I know I'm going a bit out of order here, but a year after this, a lady came into the room in

132
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:40.760
Pertelsdorf. And Sarah's up, so actually she might even be online, I don't know.

133
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:47.080
And she said, why isn't she going to India? And I said, oh, she's pregnant, Sharmataji.

134
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.560
And then Sharmataji looked at me, she said, but you were pregnant. And I said,

135
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.520
yes, but I didn't know Sharmataji. She said, oh yes, but I did.

136
00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:02.520
And this was the time when I was pregnant in Ganapati Pule. So yeah.

137
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:12.760
This was the sari Sharmataji sat on in Pertelsdorf when she was talking about this.

138
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:20.200
And so that was a really nice moment.

139
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:29.160
Sharmataji gave me quite a few saris, not always personally. I got them mostly through Hamid.

140
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:34.360
But this one I got personally. And this was at Saraswade.

141
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:49.720
I think it was about 1997, around about this time. Hamid was leader of Austria for quite some time,

142
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:57.000
so this is why I received quite a lot of saris. And we had another

143
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.440
I'll just get this one.

144
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.680
I mean, when you look at them, you think, gosh, I got all these saris. And you don't

145
00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:15.480
really remember exactly when the time was that you got them. But this sari I remember.

146
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:27.000
Sharmataji gave me this sari. It was in when Iran and Australia were holding Guru Puja.

147
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:35.320
And this was actually given to me for Iran. So that was this sari.

148
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:49.320
So I have other saris here. Maybe I can just put the screen on it.

149
00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:03.880
I think you can see them there. There's about four or five saris that were given to me

150
00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:12.760
at different times during Hamid's leadership. Sabina Akhil also has more or less the same

151
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:20.920
saris we were given them. We both got saris the same together. So yeah, what else?

152
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:29.320
I'm just going to put up the picture of your name in the frame as well.

153
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:36.680
Yeah, okay. That would be nice. I did the Sharmataji's handwriting. It was so special

154
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:42.360
when I received the sari with the name written. And my name written down Glenda, you know,

155
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:49.080
which was really quite amazing that Sharmataji wrote my name. And then underneath she writes

156
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:55.800
it in Hindi and then underneath that Gauri. I don't know whether you can see it that closely

157
00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:02.840
there. I think that's the other one, Caroline. I had already previously put up.

158
00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:07.160
There's one that's really. I had already put it up again.

159
00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:17.720
And Edward was so kind to frame it for me. And I've kept it ever since. It's a very beautiful

160
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:22.040
thing to have. You can see the Hindi is at the bottom. The Hindi is at the bottom. Yeah.

161
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:30.600
Yeah. And it is a beautiful frame as well.

162
00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:42.520
Yeah. So should I tell any other stories? Yes, please. As many as you have. I don't have that

163
00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:49.000
many sari stories. I mean the saris. Well, I can tell you another story about my daughter,

164
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:59.720
actually. She put on a fashion show of all Indian clothing. And it was part of her getting into

165
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:07.640
university in Australia. And it was at La Donna Messa. It's called the Women's exhibition.

166
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:14.280
And I mean I had 16 girls parading with all different types of clothes down in my cellar

167
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:19.800
for quite a few months before this. But it was really powerful. Because each,

168
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.000
they started off with the muladhara and they had everything in red. So there was red punjabis,

169
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.360
red saris. And it was just a mixture. And then they danced to it and came out with these,

170
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:35.800
in a very good display. So they started off with the muladhara and then they went up to

171
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:42.280
Swatthastan, went up to all the colours of the chakras. And the last one was a wedding. They had

172
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:50.360
the Indian clothes on for the wedding as well. The sari, the wedding saris on. So it was a really

173
00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:57.640
nice thing to do. And it just showed you how auspicious Indian clothing is. And it was very

174
00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:04.200
successful actually. And she used it and got into university with this presentation of her work. So

175
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:08.440
it was actually really, really a lovely thing. Well what was she studying, Gary?

176
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:21.960
Oh she did film, communication in film and media. She got her bachelor in Australia with that.

177
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:27.880
Unfortunately she can't use it because she's in Czech Republic with two little boys at the moment.

178
00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:32.280
So she's not really doing the job she worked for. But she'll get back to it probably.

179
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:43.160
Yeah. That's lovely. So I do have, no I mean that is a lovely story. I do have also this

180
00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.640
picture of you and Christine which I don't know if you, that was because you talked about that.

181
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.960
Yeah. I don't know whether Christine's online but I can't see who's online but I think she might be.

182
00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:59.640
Christine and I came to Sahaja Yoga around about the same time, about the same age. We're both

183
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:07.000
born in 1952. And somebody happened to walk past and see us both sitting there with our saris on

184
00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:12.040
and took a photo. And I thought, it was just after Christine did her sari presentation as

185
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:17.000
well. So it was really nice to have it. It was at Sri Katikeya Puja recently.

186
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.600
Yes if you put it up I can tell another story about that sari.

187
00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:32.600
Yeah. Sri Katikeya Puja. And we were both sitting there. The sari I have on was actually one of

188
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:40.360
these saris where Shri Mataji bought them all. And I think they were from China. And she said,

189
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:46.520
we all should take one. And I don't, I think they were all free. I don't believe we paid for them

190
00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:54.440
even. And I chose this one. And the altar happened to be exactly the same colour of my sari. It was

191
00:22:54.440 --> 00:23:02.360
golden and this sort of petrol coloured. And yeah, it was really, it's a very comfortable sari to

192
00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:09.320
wear. But it's also one that Shri Mataji bought and gave to the collective to choose. You know.

193
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.240
Yeah. Wow.

194
00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.800
Yeah. What else can I talk about?

195
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:37.720
I mean quite often we were ironing, I was ironing Shri Mataji's saris for the program. I remember

196
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:46.840
ironing her white saris. That was extremely powerful. You know, you just went into meditation

197
00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:52.040
ironing her sari. Of course you were a little bit nervous that you didn't do it properly.

198
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.920
But I remember ironing her sari for the program and

199
00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.840
this beautiful white sari. Yeah. That was amazing.

200
00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:15.240
We were very, very blessed to be so often with Shri Mataji. And we can't thank her enough for

201
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:24.200
allowing us this time with her. We were so close. And in the early days in India, we were able to

202
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:31.080
offer garlands around her neck every day. And we were able to go to her feet every day. And

203
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:38.200
sometimes we were at Shri Mataji's feet for, you know, ten minutes while she worked on us. And

204
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:46.200
we felt amazing afterwards. I remember one time when Shri Mataji gave us all the bindi

205
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:56.760
and worked on our aagirs. It was really powerful. These first India tours were very, very personal

206
00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:05.720
and we were very often called by our name. And Shri Mataji gave us little Ganesha's in our hands

207
00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:14.200
and we received so much in those first India tours. And that's why these saris also receiving

208
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:22.040
them personally from Shri Mataji is such an amazing blessing. And yeah, we treasure them.

209
00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.120
And I've looked after them all these years. I don't wear them. You know, it's something that

210
00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:38.440
I've kept. So yeah, especially my Gauri sari. That is, was a very special time.

211
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:46.600
It wasn't easy with two little girls there in India for three weeks while Hamid was enjoying

212
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:52.680
every day the Navarachupujas in Pratistan. And I was there with the two girls in this private home.

213
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:57.720
But the blessings came and the time we had in Pratistan with Shri Mataji at that time

214
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:03.480
was very special. And it was just my family, just our family with the two little kids. And

215
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:09.480
Shri Mataji was talking about the little kids. Oh, oh, look, see the lovely kids. And they were

216
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:16.440
really nice and they were well behaved. But it was such a special close time with Shri Mataji. And

217
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:25.640
with Shri Mataji. And we will never forget it. And also in Ganapati Pula,

218
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:34.600
we were invited to Ganapati Pula that year. And that was a very special year too, 1988.

219
00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:42.840
Yeah. I mean, I can go on, I suppose, with different stories, but it's not sari stories then.

220
00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:50.200
Maybe somebody else likes to tell a story. Is there somebody online that wants to tell a story

221
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:57.320
spontaneously? Gary, Gary, when you talked about Hamid in the garden, I remember all the Austrians.

222
00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:06.200
He he wanted all these trees from Austria. Yeah. So we all were going to India tour. And we,

223
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:11.320
every one of us had a little tree, like it was smaller than us. And we brought them on the

224
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:18.280
planes with us. And in those days, I don't know how we just need to get through, didn't you? Yeah.

225
00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:23.640
We, we, we had trees and the plane was filled with these trees.

226
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:29.640
We're bringing from mother's garden. We had all of these seeds, you know,

227
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:34.760
boxes and boxes of seeds he brought in, you know, we got them out of our, like, we checked them all

228
00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:39.720
in, you know, and it actually would have been really illegal to bring them all in, you know,

229
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:44.760
there's seeds from all over the world. I think Hamid was asking for people to donate things over

230
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:51.000
all around the world or all over Europe. And he gathered them all, you know, and so it wasn't,

231
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:59.320
it wasn't normal to, to come in with all these seeds. And I remember this, I remember so clearly

232
00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:04.360
this lady in the white sari coming up as like a savior, you know, it's like, it was like

233
00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:09.720
Sumatranji was in this woman, you know, she just came up and she said, oh, just go through,

234
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.680
you plant a nice garden. But the way she said it was just so beautiful, you know, she just sort of,

235
00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:21.160
she knew, you know, that it was something special. And yeah, it was so, so nice.

236
00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:28.120
And it's such a beautiful garden. It was, it was so, it was like a paradise garden,

237
00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:36.840
like the Garden of Eden. And then, and then they raised it, I believe. Then it was at one point,

238
00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:45.240
completely bulldozed by one of the sisters. Yeah, it's not there anymore.

239
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:51.880
Oh, yeah, really? Yeah, yeah. I mean, Hamid went there every, every year for two months,

240
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:57.560
two months holiday. He had two months holiday after his work and every year for two months.

241
00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:06.040
He was working in Protestant. In fact, he was working there when I, when my second child was born.

242
00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:12.600
How many years did he do that for, Gary? Four or five years, you know, bro, yeah, consecutive years.

243
00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.840
You had to because he had to watch it, you know, make sure it was going to grow properly and then

244
00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:23.560
new plants were planted and it was a lot of work. Yeah, a lot of work. So Betty wants to,

245
00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:28.760
Betty from the US wants to know if you had a son after you were thinking about wanting a son?

246
00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:36.440
No, we didn't have a son. We had a, we had a third daughter who lives in America, actually. Yeah,

247
00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:43.560
no, we didn't get our son. No. Each child was a son for Hamid

248
00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:51.080
and they're all daughters. Yeah, but they've got sons. Well, Daya's got two sons. Yeah.

249
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:58.120
So I went on India tour pregnant. I was five months pregnant and I went on my last India tour

250
00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:05.320
with my first child. Yes, I know, I didn't know, but then when, when Shimadaji, a year later,

251
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:11.720
when Shudeva was already one, Shimadaji looked at me and it was just so amazing, you know, she said,

252
00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:17.640
well, I knew you were pregnant. I was just sitting there. I thought, oh my gosh, you know, of course

253
00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:24.920
you knew. Yeah, I got into a little bit of trouble when I came back because that was the year that was

254
00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:33.000
1991, 1992. It was the year when everybody got hepatitis. Oh yeah, including me.

255
00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:40.040
Pregnant. Oh yeah, but I had no symptoms. Unlike other people, I only found out because I was

256
00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:44.520
getting the regular pregnancy blood tests and they said, oh, do you know you've got hepatitis B?

257
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.480
Wow. My gynecologist wasn't very impressed. I have to say.

258
00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:00.360
No, I came back from Australia, from India, you know, and went to the gynecologist. I was already

259
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:05.320
two and a half months pregnant, you know, I was shocked actually. I just had no idea, you know,

260
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:12.840
at the time. And yeah, that was the gift for Protestant. She's the gift.

261
00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:22.840
Okay, well, I'm going to stop the recording now.
