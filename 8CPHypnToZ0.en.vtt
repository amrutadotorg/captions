00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.290
It was very interesting I was thinking about
you all and about the people who have done

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.819
so much for Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:35.349
It is impossible really to say how many have
worked for Sahaja Yoga with such interest

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.190
and dedication.

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:50.700
And this dedication is directed by divine
force that’s why I think you people are

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:59.340
not even aware how much you have worked so
hard without getting any material gain out

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.519
of it.

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:10.452
And the joy has no value.

00:03:10.452 --> 00:03:22.599
We cannot evaluate in any human terminology
nor can we describe it as to how we feel

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:28.329
the joy of oneness together.

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:34.790
This togetherness is very much felt in Ganapatipule.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:42.620
I see the leaders from all over the world
have become great friends – there’s no

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.790
jealousy, there’s no quarrelling, there’s
no fighting, there’s no domination, there’s

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.479
no shouting, nothing.

00:03:50.479 --> 00:04:04.009
Such beautiful brothers and sisters such a
beautiful family we have created out of this

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:07.340
beautiful universe.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:14.590
Now we have to maintain the beauty individually
and collectively.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:22.079
Some people think that individually if you
do something that is alright, but if it is

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.940
not related to the collective it cannot be
sahaja.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:37.498
Anything that you do has to be related to
the collective.

00:04:37.498 --> 00:04:46.029
Now to be individualistic is a trend in the
modern times and in that how far we have gone

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:51.089
into nonsense that we know very well.

00:04:51.089 --> 00:05:01.720
Individuality is a personality within yourself
which has to be of different hues, of different

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.500
colours, of different beauties.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.745
Like if you see the flowers, now every flower
is different and individual.

00:05:11.745 --> 00:05:21.030
In its beauty, in it’s softness, in it’s
fragrance, in it’s form, in it’s colour

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:33.460
every leaf is different, but they adorn the
whole forest, the whole garden in such a beautiful

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.560
manner that the whole thing works towards
the collective.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:46.150
So the individuality is where we do not become
like other people, exactly like military people

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:55.740
as they are, the outside people may become
like military people but inside you become

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:05.590
individual in the sense everybody has a different
way of pleasing others, of teasing others,

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.520
of loving others of saying beautiful things.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:18.800
Everybody has a style of saying nice things
and of offering your words of thanks and words

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.040
of appreciation.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.909
This individuality is to be developed by all
of you.

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:31.620
That what is the new thing I can say to please.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:37.470
As people I have seen every day think ‘What
fashion I should have, what sort of a fashion

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:45.950
I should wear, how I should become more fashionable
outside, if you can think ‘How can I be

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:49.360
more fashionable inside myself?’

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.599
In India fashionable has a different meaning.

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:56.719
It doesn’t mean the way we know in England.

00:06:56.719 --> 00:07:01.150
I think many people don’t know that in England
fashionable means popular.

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:09.060
Here fashionable means out of the blue, something
special, something extraordinary is fashionable

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.380
here.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:19.290
So if we could put our attention to this,
how we could be more beautiful inside, when

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:26.719
we are touching others hearts, how we could
be very pure in our expression, genuine in

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:29.140
our expression, not artificially.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:34.560
Like we have seen also that even we are superficial
you’ll say ‘Thank you very much, thank

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:39.890
you very much, thank you very much’ and
you don’t mean it, it’s just a lip service

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.649
you don’t mean it.

00:07:41.649 --> 00:07:47.800
But in Sahaja Yoga when you want to thank
you see it is really heart felt you say it

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.410
from your heart, you have to put your hand
on your heart otherwise you just can’t say

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:59.280
it, it is that way that we should feel and
once you open that heart fully, opening of

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:05.669
the heart is very important and that, unless
and until you can do it you cannot enjoy anything

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:11.720
in Sahaja Yoga because the heart where resides
the Spirit and it is the Spirit that emits

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.830
the joy.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:20.079
So if you do not have an open heart, and if
you are just living on very superficial level

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:29.670
you can never enjoy Sahaja Yoga, and this
enjoyment of Sahaja Yoga is something to be

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:35.139
really achieved and to be enjoyed.

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:39.389
Because that’s why you are here for, there’s
nothing else to offer in Sahaja Yoga but the

00:08:39.389 --> 00:08:44.589
joy of life, and that is the essence of all
the achievements of life.

00:08:44.589 --> 00:08:50.160
Everything we do for the joy but everything
whatever we do for joy after some times we

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.990
find it becomes a sort of a reaction.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:04.240
So there is very important point that to make
our individuality beautiful we should not

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:11.760
immediately react to people, should not give
our own opinion ‘I don’t like it, I don’t

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.529
want it’, but we should absorb the beauty
of another person.

00:09:16.529 --> 00:09:21.300
Now supposing there’s a flower you get,
immediately you will see the beauty of the

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:26.050
flower, you like to take the fragrance of
the flower but suddenly you say ‘I don’t

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:30.740
like flowers’ then what can the flower do
to you?

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.450
So one should not react and one should not
have such subtle idea about your likes and

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:41.110
dislikes because it’s a joy-killer habit,
it’s a joy killer habit.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:51.089
If you want to enjoy take enjoyment from every
person like the bee which takes the honey

00:09:51.089 --> 00:09:58.149
from every flower you must develop that sweet
personality within yourself and then only

00:09:58.149 --> 00:10:05.170
you will know what is sweet, what is good
and the enjoyment from one person to another,

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:13.600
from one collective to another, from one city
to another, from one country to another will

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:22.050
be just beautiful like a swing, it will be
like a swing going up and down enjoying yourself,

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:31.339
that’s what is your real divine sensitivity.

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:33.779
And the divine just wants to do that.

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:41.770
It’s working out so many ways of giving
you photographs, giving you miracles, working

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:48.050
it out and making you believe that you are in
the Kingdom of God.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:53.730
But if you have all these angularities and
if you have all these ideas about yourself

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.960
then please try to neutralise them.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.260
Now some people also feel that Mother is angry
with us or some sort of thing I can never

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.000
be angry with you, for what should I be angry.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.770
But if you think like that forget it.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:11.140
First of all you must see that "something wrong
with me that’s why I think like that, I

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.140
must put myself right".

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:20.990
So just to judge yourself through such ideas
and it is only your mental projection it has nothing

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.950
to do with your heart.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:36.520
So again today the first thing we have to
know that in our heart lies the power to absorb,

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:41.050
to enjoy the beauty of spirituality.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:47.870
There’s a beautiful shloka which I had told
Mahatmaji that he should put it first, I was

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:55.830
a very small girl but he listened to me which is a beautiful Pratarnamani, the first thing you have to say

00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:03.122
'Pratarnamani udisanskura-aatm-tatvum,Sad-chit-sukham
paramhansam gatim turyam’.

00:12:03.122 --> 00:12:11.575
meaning ‘Early in the morning
I pray to that principle of my spirit

00:12:11.575 --> 00:12:26.770
Which is the truth, the attention, and joy.
So that I should go to the highest state of

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.791
my ascent.’

00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:35.505
So, opening of the heart is very important
for all of us.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:13:04.050
I am sure that most of you understand Hindi
very well, and also the English language.
