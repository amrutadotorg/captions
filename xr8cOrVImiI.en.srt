1
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,750
What is this need to go on My past?

2
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,500
In the present.

3
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:41,458
Om twamewa sakshat, Shri Nirmala Devyai namoh namaha.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's the biggest mantra, I tell you.

5
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:49,709
That's the biggest mantra. Try it.

6
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:55,417
Please repeat it again.

7
00:01:19,041 --> 00:01:23,166
Come along. Wash My feet. With the hands.

8
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:37,709
Use both your hands.

9
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:44,500
Two again.

10
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:48,999
Faster. Wash it.

11
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,417
Now, other three.

12
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:59,667
Both the hands. Come along. Two of you.

13
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:12,875
Good - done.

14
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:46,208
Those who have not been, come along.

15
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:14,667
Now the little children coming, in front.

16
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,166
Come from this side, come along.

17
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,250
Use the other hand.

18
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:52,291
All right - done.

19
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:00,709
With both the hands.

20
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,625
Now say English mantras.

21
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:18,208
All right. The another group. Come along, one by one.

22
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,542
In English.

23
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:29,500
Both the hands, good - done.

24
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:44,750
Nice. Very nice.

25
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,999
Please use both the hands.

26
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:55,583
Rub it with both the hands. That's good. All right.

27
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,250
Now, who's next? Is there more?

28
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:06,875
Go and sit behind them, one after another.

29
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:26,709
Hard. Rub it hard.

30
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:35,709
All right, done.

31
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,999
Come close.

32
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:55,250
That's the boy. You wash My feet.

33
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:01,041
Good. With the other hand also.

34
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:10,750
May God bless you. Lots of confidence!

35
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,291
May God bless you. Good.

36
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,125
Take it in, what he's saying, take it in.

37
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:39,083
You all are saying it.

38
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,542
Now, you could have seen that, Ganesha is the key.

39
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,917
Christ is the key of all the things.

40
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,999
He's the key, He's the essence of all the things, you see,

41
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:37,583
and so through Him everything works out.

42
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:39,750
See, even if you have to come to Me,

43
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,166
you have to come through Him.

44
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,166
That means in you that innocence must be born,

45
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:47,834
then you come to Me.

46
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,625
So Ganesha is so important.

47
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:52,875
And Australia is the centre of Ganesha.

48
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:57,041
So you people are so important, you are the key.

49
00:13:57,917 --> 00:13:59,625
So it is more necessary

50
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,041
that you should be much more on the essences

51
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,125
than anybody else.

52
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,166
In every way - as I told you,

53
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,709
that man has to be a man, woman has to be a woman.

54
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,041
These are all the essences, that's the essence.

55
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,709
That's very important. On you rests;

56
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:17,792
because through you it's going to work out,

57
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,458
through your innocence.

58
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,208
You are the ones who make the innocence

59
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:26,375
of the Western people - it's very important.

60
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:26,125
Better give it to Warren for the time being.

61
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:49,875
Also you must notice that every year,

62
00:15:50,208 --> 00:15:51,625
everything is shortening.

63
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,667
You see, even giving realization is shortening,

64
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,208
puja is shortening.

65
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,625
We have to save time, isn't it?

66
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:01,625
So shortening is there. But why? Because there's powers.

67
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,542
There is sustenance, and you can sustain that power,

68
00:16:14,834 --> 00:16:17,333
because you are there, so many channels;

69
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:20,583
so you can shorten it.

70
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:25,917
I hope this doesn't fall off!

71
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:30,291
Are you saying - he's saying yes.

72
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,500
All right. Now, what do we do -

73
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:40,625
just to have the washing of the hands, let's do that.

74
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,999
But you don't have to, you can put just one ....

75
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:38,208
Can somebody else do this? Come here. Pour this on.

76
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:43,834
You come the other side. You come here to do it.

77
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,999
Today, as it is the Birthday

78
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:53,375
in the island of Shri Ganesh,

79
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:57,250
I think all the Puja should be done by children,

80
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,291
it would be better.

81
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,917
All right, so the girls have to get up now.

82
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,500
Hold the sari - let them have the sari.

83
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:12,208
Have you got bigger girls, unmarried?

84
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:17,291
Just give them the sari to hold - the girls.

85
00:30:23,542 --> 00:30:25,458
I don't know if the children can hold it or not,

86
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,792
it's so heavy.

87
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:32,000
Have it double, like that.

88
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:37,125
So - now, you all stand up at an end, all right?

89
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,333
And hold the sari from this side,

90
00:30:40,959 --> 00:30:44,083
and you go that side and hold it, high.

91
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:50,041
Now, all the children first. Little that side.

92
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:54,792
All right. Now - you come forward.

93
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,917
Let the girls show the sari round. Right;

94
00:30:57,208 --> 00:30:58,542
you come forward this way.

95
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:00,709
All right. Now, you hold the sari. Go that way.

96
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:02,709
Now you, all the girls come here.

97
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:06,458
Now, you hold it on this side, hold higher.

98
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,709
Let everyone see the sari.

99
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:15,000
Some big girls should also help them.

100
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:38,250
Let them hold it at their height.

101
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,000
Now, you come along, bigger girls,

102
00:31:43,999 --> 00:31:48,208
You two or four of you, come along - the bigger ones.

103
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,041
Come here. Let them hold it a little that side.

104
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:57,208
All right, just move it in, in the children.

105
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:05,667
Now, what you do is to put here,

106
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:10,041
the red mark. Is the red mark, from there?

107
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:16,417
First make the line, all right?

108
00:32:20,875 --> 00:32:22,709
I think the big girls should hold it now,

109
00:32:22,959 --> 00:32:25,166
and we'll call them for putting the flowers, all right?

110
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,250
Just the big girls should do it. All right.

111
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:30,959
All the little ones now should sit down.

112
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:34,750
We'll call you for the flowers, all right?

113
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,875
Now, you have to put the line here ...

114
00:32:48,999 --> 00:32:50,166
and then beyond the line.

115
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:54,583
Here also one line, and then beyond the line.

116
00:32:57,417 --> 00:33:00,542
This thing has to be inside the line.

117
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,166
Put the line.

118
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:51,208
Put this under the foot.

119
00:35:18,709 --> 00:35:24,208
You have to complete the red fully, there.

120
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,125
Now you have to make a swastika.

121
00:35:57,999 --> 00:36:00,625
On top.

122
00:36:16,709 --> 00:36:21,792
Now put one also this side. It's all right.

123
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:30,291
Exactly seven you are! Did you notice that?

124
00:36:37,375 --> 00:36:40,625
Yes, now remove this from here,

125
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,542
and you have to put these individual...from here.

126
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:48,667
Have to put it little bit.

127
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,333
Make a swastika on the red,

128
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,750
in the center.

129
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:16,792
I'll help you put it.

130
00:37:19,917 --> 00:37:23,500
On top of that one.

131
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:30,000
Good. All right, done.

132
00:37:30,542 --> 00:37:34,625
Now, you bring the sari around - now.

133
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:42,375
Now, decorate with flowers.

134
00:37:42,625 --> 00:37:43,875
The children can come.

135
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:46,917
Now, bring the sari around, like that.

136
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:58,792
Let the children come, to do the flowers

137
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,667
Now, get the boys here for the flowers.

138
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:44,375
And other flowers also we got.

139
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:52,542
Let the boys do that.

140
00:38:53,917 --> 00:38:59,583
Make it straight, put it down

141
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:18,709
so that the flowers are on top.

142
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:30,166
Let the boys do the flowers and ask them to arrange them.

143
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:41,458
The bigger girls can come to do it, the girls.

144
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,999
Not the ones who have done My Feet now,

145
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,959
because the ones who have done My feet you have seen.

146
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,041
The ones who have done My Feet now,

147
00:40:49,417 --> 00:40:52,583
the other ones, come along.

148
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:10,417
Give one to her.

149
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:16,041
There, too - take one.

150
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:25,166
And all these rings...

151
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:38,125
First left, that's it .

152
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:53,834
So thank you very much!

153
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:18,959
Get some more girls there now.

154
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,999
Any other girls? Come and help.

155
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:30,667
Can you do this, you see, one side.

156
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,667
You do it equally ... the same thing the other side.

157
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:39,458
Now, this one you have to put the other way round, you see.

158
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:43,834
One is this side, and one is for that side.

159
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:26,125
So beautiful it is.

160
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,542
Shri Mataji,from all the children of Australia

161
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,667
for Your birthday.

162
00:48:12,999 --> 00:48:15,041
Thank you very much.

163
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:17,000
It's too much!

164
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:20,875
He says I have to have it now, I don't know what.

165
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:26,709
Do you know, it matches with My sari.

166
00:50:02,999 --> 00:50:06,875
It's a collar of love!

167
00:50:12,667 --> 00:50:16,959
Now, that's how it should be.

168
00:50:17,083 --> 00:50:18,542
With this collar, Shri Mataji,

169
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:23,375
we expect that the left Vishuddhi be cleared everywhere!

170
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:39,041
Also with this collar, Shri Mataji,

171
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:42,208
we chose that because the chakra of the pearls

172
00:50:42,417 --> 00:50:44,041
also is cleared!

173
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:48,166
Very good idea!

174
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:08,834
There's another ring - smaller ring - all right.

175
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:11,166
That looks so nice!

176
00:52:29,709 --> 00:52:31,792
Bit high.

177
00:52:40,999 --> 00:52:44,041
One is all right.

178
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,083
Let Me have the comb, please.

179
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:38,208
Now I am sixty-three years of age.

180
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:59,583
No, sixty-fourth year, can you imagine?

181
00:54:02,125 --> 00:54:05,208
We will have this special...

182
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:17,709
Now, those who want to take photographs can come.

183
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:18,792
This is for You, Mother.

184
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,750
Is it?

185
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,875
I know you have to look after such tremendous things,

186
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:45,875
but I don't know where our photographer has gone.

187
00:55:46,208 --> 00:55:50,208
I think he is not here ... Matthew's not here.

188
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:55,000
Let's see how it goes.

189
00:55:57,041 --> 00:56:02,250
Take a full one. Take a nice one or two.

190
00:57:01,875 --> 00:57:05,750
Now it's done. All right.

191
00:57:36,709 --> 00:57:40,875
You'd like to take it without garlands, I think it's better

192
00:57:44,542 --> 00:57:47,583
Look at this one.

193
00:57:48,041 --> 00:57:50,542
These are so beautiful.

194
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:52,750
It's the real Radha style, you see.

195
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:56,500
Most are the back side.

196
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:11,000
Look at this one here - beautiful!

197
00:58:29,625 --> 00:58:33,750
Come along. So, from where did you get all these?

198
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:39,000
Is there somebody to help?

199
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,875
It's beautiful. The best style we've had.

200
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,917
This is the design we should have also.

201
00:59:09,333 --> 00:59:11,125
We should take it to England, India,

202
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:14,999
we'll work it out which is the best.

203
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:21,291
These are the three Goddesses...So many ornaments!

204
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:41,667
Now. I'd better see what ....

205
01:00:41,999 --> 01:00:44,291
It's so nice and comfortable.

206
01:00:44,709 --> 01:00:46,458
It could be like that, you see,

207
01:00:46,542 --> 01:00:49,792
because this must have been Mooladhara ...

208
01:00:50,041 --> 01:00:51,542
That was the thing:

209
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:55,792
there's no way of covering the Mooladhara.

210
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,083
So must be like that. See?

211
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,500
Now, let Me have the sari on.

212
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:12,125
Put the sari on, the girls - come along.

213
01:02:53,291 --> 01:02:57,250
Take a full one, if you like.

214
01:03:19,917 --> 01:03:21,375
They've taken the feet, all right.

215
01:03:21,709 --> 01:03:23,750
Now, that's all the photographs?

216
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:27,333
Now, lots to do. You have to get the garland.

217
01:03:27,834 --> 01:03:30,542
So first of all give Me those things that are there.

218
01:03:30,875 --> 01:03:33,750
I'll just touch them. All right?

219
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,000
More girls, bigger girls.

220
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:15,375
Three saris in one.

221
01:07:40,959 --> 01:07:42,999
All the seven girls come.

222
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:45,250
Those who were holding My sari.

223
01:07:56,417 --> 01:08:00,500
All right? May God bless you.

224
01:08:02,917 --> 01:08:06,417
Now done. Now flowers.

225
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,834
The girls can do it.

226
01:08:17,999 --> 01:08:21,583
Now the garlands.

227
01:08:56,083 --> 01:09:02,417
This is typically, this is made in South India,

228
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:04,250
they make a huge big thing.

229
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,709
And also in India they did it.

230
01:09:05,999 --> 01:09:07,667
And they called as ...

231
01:09:07,959 --> 01:09:11,083
Thank you very much!

232
01:09:56,041 --> 01:10:01,917
Take a full one, with the feet in.

233
01:10:51,792 --> 01:10:54,083
Thank you very much, thank you.

234
01:10:56,750 --> 01:11:00,500
With the aarti we'd like to keep the garland.

235
01:13:04,834 --> 01:13:08,375
Also the big brass things can be brought in.

236
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:11,999
One this side, one that side.

237
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:13,333
These things can move out,

238
01:13:13,625 --> 01:13:17,834
so that you can take a full photograph.

239
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:48,166
All right. Now I'll come down here.
