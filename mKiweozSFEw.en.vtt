02:41.000 --> 02:48.780
﻿I don’t know how to thank you all for
such a welcome you have organized for Me.

03:05.843 --> 03:13.452
Actually on Moscow’s airport
they were little non-cooperative,

03:13.652 --> 03:19.340
and I was worried because
they said, “You can’t go to Kyiv”.

03:41.627 --> 03:46.740
All of your prayers have
worked and I am here with you.

04:05.543 --> 04:08.380
There are so many who have come with Me,

04:08.855 --> 04:13.540
and everybody is so anxious to meet you here.

04:22.037 --> 04:26.502
They have had a big conference of the scientists.

04:26.718 --> 04:30.940
There were 2,000 scientists and about 10,000 people,

04:31.864 --> 04:40.075
and they were convinced that
morality is very important for medicine.

05:00.151 --> 05:06.054
Without morality people cannot keep
good health. They contaminate diseases.

05:21.677 --> 05:26.929
And I was surprised, this is
only possible in your country

05:27.247 --> 05:31.900
– either Russia or Kyiv – where
people have such enlightened mind.

05:45.644 --> 05:49.536
No one can think of such
a thing in other countries.

05:49.737 --> 05:53.100
You people are very advanced in your wisdom.

06:00.068 --> 06:06.100
Also you are very deep in understanding
spirituality – how important it is.

06:15.743 --> 06:21.020
I don’t know when will I learn
Russian, it’s quite a difficult language.

06:31.011 --> 06:37.060
If I had come in My young age I would
have learnt it, but I didn’t come that time.

06:37.260 --> 06:41.695
And I find that even if I
don’t understand the language

06:41.895 --> 06:44.095
– I understand your heart.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.969
Some Indians had come and they said,

07:15.169 --> 07:21.060
“These people have a very, very large
heart. We cannot be compared with them.”

07:50.992 --> 07:58.060
Even the English, the Germans,
Austrians – all of them feel that about you.

08:04.819 --> 08:11.420
So, now we have a Diwali Puja in,

08:13.631 --> 08:15.940
in Istanbul,

08:16.140 --> 08:22.540
and it is specially I have arranged
there so that it’s easy for you to come there.

08:36.191 --> 08:43.740
We are going to have marriages there.
So, I would like to have the forms filled by you.

08:57.431 --> 09:03.340
So, I hope to see you in Istanbul,
which is not so difficult to go from here.

09:19.717 --> 09:23.317
So, may God bless you all, may God bless You.
