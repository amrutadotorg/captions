09:31.039 --> 09:34.967
So we have all gathered here today

09:37.094 --> 09:40.390
in this country of Austria,

09:40.869 --> 09:42.994
which in Sanskrit we call it Astra.

09:43.000 --> 09:47.474
Astra means: The divine weapons.

09:48.377 --> 09:57.393
And the greatest credit,
I would give to Austria is this:

09:57.584 --> 10:03.842
That you don´t find
any fundamentalism of any kind,

10:03.875 --> 10:09.259
whether it is Islam, or whether
it is Christian, or Hindu.

10:09.284 --> 10:13.717
any kind of fundamentalism
operating in this country.

10:15.284 --> 10:18.647
Which is a very, very, very rare thing.

10:18.672 --> 10:25.328
Right from Russia to England you find everywhere

10:25.353 --> 10:31.517
there is a subtle fundamentalism existing.

10:32.438 --> 10:35.249
And this country has this speciality

10:35.274 --> 10:38.354
that there is no fundamentalism.

10:38.379 --> 10:42.003
And also racialism you don´t feel here at all.

10:42.028 --> 10:46.093
In every country I have felt that there is racialism.

10:46.118 --> 10:49.829
Of course, in Russia, there isn´t.
But otherwise.

10:50.799 --> 10:58.671
So this country seems to be
a very open minded country

10:58.965 --> 11:05.998
and perhaps because they have
such beautiful nature with them.

11:06.236 --> 11:13.186
In this beautiful nature they want to enjoy the nature

11:13.218 --> 11:16.124
and for that you have to have an open heart.

11:16.149 --> 11:20.855
Or maybe the vice versa, the nature
must have opened their heart.

11:21.705 --> 11:25.764
So, this land has a speciality:

11:25.780 --> 11:28.404
And I am very happy you all have from all the way

11:28.417 --> 11:32.697
from so many countries, even from America, Australia,

11:32.722 --> 11:38.387
India, such far-off countries you have assembled here

11:38.951 --> 11:45.696
for this celebration and yesterday we actually saw

11:45.721 --> 11:50.502
ourselves, with our own eyes,
the grace falling on this country.

11:50.514 --> 11:53.202
Cause this country deserves it.

11:53.227 --> 11:57.470
Any country which has fundamentalism behind it,

11:57.505 --> 11:59.892
will have to go down in this modern times.

11:59.917 --> 12:04.941
Any kind of fundamentalism is out of date

12:04.966 --> 12:08.233
and they cannot survive.
They will be thrown out.

12:08.258 --> 12:12.700
Out of the evolution of the societies.

12:12.744 --> 12:17.647
So: One has to open yourself to everything.

12:17.947 --> 12:23.095
Moreover, Sahaja Yoga encompasses all the great religions

12:23.120 --> 12:29.460
and all the great incarnations,
prophets and saints.

12:29.963 --> 12:33.755
We respect all of them equally,

12:33.780 --> 12:38.259
like the jews respect Christ as they respect Moses,

12:38.284 --> 12:44.052
the Muslims respect Moses, as they respect Muhammed Sahab,

12:44.124 --> 12:48.752
the Hindus respect Muhammed Sahab,
as they respect Shri Rama.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.815
This kind of a mutual respect,

12:51.840 --> 12:55.684
that we have, is not by blind faith,

12:55.764 --> 12:59.345
but by understanding through Sahaja Yoga,

12:59.388 --> 13:02.878
what we call  on our central nervous system

13:02.903 --> 13:08.961
we can feel the divine power,

13:08.986 --> 13:14.192
and our whole being works like a computer

13:14.217 --> 13:18.197
and we can find out what is the truth about all of them.

13:18.222 --> 13:23.303
And that is how through our enlightenment,

13:23.328 --> 13:29.081
in that light, we worship all these people equally the same.

13:29.106 --> 13:35.285
But when it starts going to
the fundamental bases,

13:35.341 --> 13:42.278
everybody is ruining,
everybody's name is put into shame

13:42.303 --> 13:46.426
and all these great people are looked upon

13:46.431 --> 13:50.950
as some sort of trouble-makers.

13:55.292 --> 13:59.797
So, today´s thing speciality is that

13:59.845 --> 14:03.264
if we have any fundamentalistic ideas within our head,

14:03.289 --> 14:05.322
first of all, we should drive it out.

14:05.347 --> 14:08.066
In a way, whatever is happening in modern times

14:08.091 --> 14:12.579
is the exposure of all, that is wrong,
evil and destructive.

14:12.969 --> 14:17.162
And all that is today shown to us, very clearly.

14:17.195 --> 14:19.589
We see it so clearly happening,

14:19.621 --> 14:25.749
that those people, who are against
unification of the world,

14:25.774 --> 14:32.914
oneness of the world, and love for each other ,
are just getting exposed.

14:32.939 --> 14:35.343
So, our main power is our love.

14:35.376 --> 14:39.026
And that love is so effective,

14:39.051 --> 14:42.444
so kind, so tender, so beautiful,

14:42.469 --> 14:48.219
it has to be felt and to be enjoyed.

14:48.429 --> 14:51.197
So I am here for a very short time with you

14:51.222 --> 14:53.498
but I´ll be coming back .

14:53.523 --> 14:57.975
Because they want to shoot me down there but after some time

15:01.603 --> 15:04.945
I´ll be here to talk to you

15:04.977 --> 15:11.354
and I hope, you´ll enjoy this beautiful place.

15:16.337 --> 15:25.766
Have they arranged there?

15:25.791 --> 15:28.162
Have they arranged the other place all right ?

15:28.187 --> 15:30.877
Can we go now? Ask them.

15:30.902 --> 15:33.484
In case they want, I can go and come back here,

15:33.516 --> 15:37.216
so I could be here for a longer period..

15:49.538 --> 15:53.022
So let them go first, I will join.

16:46.662 --> 16:49.574
Yet there are some more to arrive, has it?

16:49.859 --> 16:52.969
All of them not yet arrived they believe.

16:54.321 --> 16:57.701
Are we expecting more people?

16:59.361 --> 17:04.358
French have not. French ? Few of them have come.

17:15.786 --> 17:19.527
They are expecting about 800 people.
