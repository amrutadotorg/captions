“The statutes of the Lord”, Guru purnima, London (UK), 27 July 1980

00:03.302 --> 00:15.871
Today you have arranged this worship of your guru,

00:16.071 --> 00:22.279
that is your Mother. Perhaps you are very unique people

00:22.479 --> 00:27.494
that have a guru who is a Mother.

00:31.318 --> 00:36.935
Why this puja is arranged?

00:39.285 --> 00:44.500
One has to know that it is very important

00:44.700 --> 00:50.593
for every disciple to worship the guru,

00:50.793 --> 00:53.267
but the guru has to be a real guru,

00:53.468 --> 00:58.792
not a one who is just exploiting the disciples

00:58.992 --> 01:04.375
and who is not authorised by God.

01:09.264 --> 01:16.352
The puja is arranged because you have been initiated

01:16.553 --> 01:21.921
into the statutes of the Lord.

01:22.702 --> 01:31.483
You have been told what are the dharmas of a human being.

01:34.054 --> 01:36.861
For that actually you need not have a guru.

01:37.061 --> 01:39.150
You can read any book and you will know

01:39.350 --> 01:43.494
what are the statutes of the Lord.

01:45.133 --> 01:51.906
But [the] guru has to see that you practise them.

01:56.113 --> 02:02.759
These statutes are to be practised,

02:02.959 --> 02:08.671
to be brought into your own life,

02:08.872 --> 02:15.594
which is a difficult thing. And without a guru, a correcting force,

02:15.794 --> 02:20.539
it is very difficult to follow these statutes of Lord;

02:20.739 --> 02:25.820
because there is a gap between human awareness and Divine awareness,

02:26.020 --> 02:28.132
a very big gap.

02:28.332 --> 02:33.083
And that gap can be only fulfilled by a guru

02:33.284 --> 02:37.253
who himself is complete.

02:37.453 --> 02:41.581
Today is a purnima day. “Purnima” means the complete moon.

02:41.781 --> 02:47.129
The guru has to be a complete personality

02:47.329 --> 02:53.944
to talk about these statutes and to elevate

02:54.144 --> 02:59.191
his disciples to this level of understanding,

02:59.392 --> 03:03.788
by which they imbibe those statutes.

03:03.988 --> 03:10.953
He is there to fulfil this gap,

03:11.153 --> 03:14.899
and for that it is essential that every guru has to be

03:15.100 --> 03:22.272
a realised-soul of a very high quality and greatly evolved.

03:23.374 --> 03:27.842
He need not be a person who is an ascetic,

03:28.042 --> 03:35.672
or he need not be a person who is living in the forest.

03:36.359 --> 03:40.883
He could be a common householder.

03:41.084 --> 03:45.199
He could be a king.

03:46.207 --> 03:55.606
All these outward manifestations of one’s life do not matter.

03:55.806 --> 04:01.002
Whatever may be your position,

04:01.203 --> 04:05.763
I would say the so-called position, in this world,

04:05.963 --> 04:11.810
makes no difference to your being a guru,

04:12.010 --> 04:17.229
as long as you have imbibed the statutes of the Lord.

04:17.429 --> 04:24.179
Again, I say, you have to imbibe the statutes.

04:29.484 --> 04:33.718
Let’s see what are the statutes.

04:36.082 --> 04:43.714
First is, you do not harm anyone.

04:47.094 --> 04:53.816
First principle is that we are not to harm anyone.

04:54.016 --> 05:00.242
Animals do harm without knowing that they are doing harm.

05:00.443 --> 05:03.501
If you go near a snake, he’ll bite.

05:03.701 --> 05:10.535
If a scorpion is there he can put his poison into your being.

05:10.736 --> 05:16.800
Animals are not to harm anyone;

05:17.000 --> 05:21.097
they can correct but not harm.

05:21.297 --> 05:30.219
So the principle of not harming was taken a very, very -

05:42.596 --> 05:49.740
to a point where reality disappeared.

05:49.940 --> 05:54.414
For example, when it was said “Do not harm anyone”,

05:54.614 --> 05:58.336
so people started saying, “Alright, we’ll not harm mosquitoes.

05:58.536 --> 06:01.605
We’ll not harm bugs. We’ll not kill them.”

06:01.805 --> 06:05.948
And there are some people who are following religions

06:06.148 --> 06:11.094
in which they preserve mosquitoes and bugs.

06:12.993 --> 06:15.504
This is absurdity!

06:15.704 --> 06:22.544
Taking anything to absurdity cannot be Reality.

06:23.550 --> 06:30.186
First of all, we should not harm

06:30.386 --> 06:35.681
anyone who is walking in the path of God,

06:35.881 --> 06:41.709
the one who is a realised-soul.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.025
He may be wrong, there may be some mistakes in him,

06:50.226 --> 06:54.981
still he needs correction; nobody’s perfect as yet.

06:55.181 --> 07:00.386
So do not harm, always try to help.

07:03.198 --> 07:06.224
Secondly, anybody who is a real seeker,

07:06.432 --> 07:09.120
he may be wrong, he might have gone to wrong gurus,

07:09.321 --> 07:13.026
he might have done wrong things;

07:13.227 --> 07:16.945
but have feelings, because you have been going

07:17.145 --> 07:19.699
on the wrong path yourself sometimes;

07:19.899 --> 07:26.831
you have been misled before, so have more sympathies.

07:27.031 --> 07:30.706
That’s why, if you have done mistakes, in a way it’s good,

07:30.906 --> 07:36.027
because you have more sympathies for such people.

07:37.354 --> 07:43.504
Then you are not to harm human beings in any way.

07:47.379 --> 07:51.999
You are not to cause them any bodily harm;

07:52.199 --> 08:01.023
any emotional upsetting just for harm’s sake.

08:01.224 --> 08:05.384
For correction it’s alright.

08:11.582 --> 08:19.851
The second statute is that you have to stand on your own legs

08:20.051 --> 08:26.598
and know that you are here, one with the truth,

08:26.798 --> 08:31.652
the testimony,

08:31.852 --> 08:34.685
the testimony of the truth:

08:34.885 --> 08:38.653
that you have seen the truth, you know what truth is,

08:38.853 --> 08:44.329
and you cannot compromise with falsehood, you cannot.

08:45.257 --> 08:49.491
For that you need not harm anyone.

08:51.810 --> 08:56.339
You have to just profess it.

08:57.456 --> 09:00.479
You have to stand up and say that you have seen the truth

09:00.680 --> 09:08.226
and this is the truth, and you have to be one with it,

09:08.426 --> 09:13.840
so that people see that light of truth in you and they accept you.

09:15.183 --> 09:18.093
It’s not for telling others that, “You have to be truthful,

09:18.293 --> 09:21.890
and this is the truth we have seen, that this is what God’s laws are,

09:22.090 --> 09:24.368
how they work out.”

09:24.568 --> 09:27.220
Through vibratory awareness we have been able to see

09:27.421 --> 09:31.397
this is the truth.

09:31.598 --> 09:35.621
But be completely confident about it.

09:35.821 --> 09:39.855
But for that, first of all you must test yourself completely;

09:40.055 --> 09:42.558
otherwise you might be playing into the hands of ego.

09:42.758 --> 09:45.168
It happens with many people who start doing Sahaja Yoga,

09:45.368 --> 09:48.328
to begin with. So be cautious,

09:48.529 --> 09:53.659
be sure that you are telling the truth and nothing else,

09:53.860 --> 09:56.636
and that you have felt the truth in full ways.

09:56.836 --> 09:58.852
Those who have not felt any vibrations

09:59.053 --> 10:03.648
shouldn’t talk of Sahaj Yog at all; they have no authority.

10:04.874 --> 10:07.776
They have to receive vibrations,

10:07.976 --> 10:10.768
they have to fully imbibe within them,

10:10.968 --> 10:17.855
and then they can say, “Yes, we have felt.”

10:18.830 --> 10:22.123
This is a very important task Sahaja Yogis have to do

10:22.323 --> 10:27.348
in these modern times, is to tell aloud

10:27.548 --> 10:30.652
that they have found the truth.

10:30.852 --> 10:35.087
That part is very weak.

10:35.287 --> 10:38.102
In whatever way you like: you can write books,

10:38.302 --> 10:40.805
you can announce it, you can talk to your friends, to your relations,

10:41.005 --> 10:45.584
everywhere; tell them, “This is the truth now!”

10:45.785 --> 10:49.482
That you have entered into the Kingdom of God;

10:49.682 --> 10:54.826
that you are blessed by the grace of God.

10:55.026 --> 10:59.164
That you are realised-souls,

10:59.364 --> 11:04.747
that you have felt the Divine power which is pervading everywhere,

11:04.948 --> 11:09.802
and that you can give Realisations to others.

11:11.630 --> 11:16.375
This you have to tell others.

11:16.575 --> 11:19.155
And know that, by your accepting Truth,

11:19.355 --> 11:25.004
you are not adding anything to the Truth, but you are adorning yourself.

11:26.931 --> 11:34.971
One requires courage to enjoy the truth.

11:37.370 --> 11:40.293
Sometimes people will laugh at you, will mock at you,

11:40.493 --> 11:43.512
may persecute also;

11:43.712 --> 11:46.512
but that should not be any worry to you,

11:46.712 --> 11:50.695
because your relationship is with the statutes

11:50.895 --> 11:55.207
and with the grace of God.

11:57.744 --> 12:02.839
When that is your connection,

12:03.040 --> 12:06.637
you should not worry about other people, what they have to say about you.

12:06.837 --> 12:10.695
You have to stand up, adorn yourself with that Truth

12:10.895 --> 12:15.769
and talk to people [so] that people will know that you have found it.

12:15.970 --> 12:18.869
With that authenticity with which you speak,

12:19.069 --> 12:23.148
people will know that you have found it.

12:23.905 --> 12:29.201
The difference between a realised-soul and a non-realised-soul

12:29.401 --> 12:32.842
is basically this:

12:33.042 --> 12:37.305
he doesn’t talk of his woes and his separation with God,

12:37.505 --> 12:42.349
but he says, “l have found it now. This is it.”

12:43.605 --> 12:49.392
Like Christ said, “I am the Light, I am the Path.”

12:50.661 --> 12:55.508
Anybody else can say that,

12:55.709 --> 12:59.712
but you can make out that it is not true.

12:59.912 --> 13:06.415
With the confidence,

13:06.615 --> 13:12.043
with that complete understanding coming out of your heart,

13:12.243 --> 13:16.246
people can make out this is Absolute Truth.

13:16.446 --> 13:20.223
And then all kinds of falsehood must be denounced.

13:20.423 --> 13:23.720
It doesn’t matter if somebody feels bad,

13:23.921 --> 13:29.209
because by telling that you are saving them, and not harming them.

13:29.409 --> 13:35.404
But [it] must be told in a correct way, not in a frivolous way.

13:35.604 --> 13:39.057
In a very persuasive way, you must tell them that, “No, this is wrong.”

13:39.257 --> 13:42.888
You must wait for the time when you can tell people,

13:43.089 --> 13:46.177
more in confidence. Talk to them, “This is wrong,

13:46.378 --> 13:51.037
this is wrong, you don’t know. We’ve done the same thing.”

13:51.237 --> 13:57.206
This is how you are going to express

13:57.407 --> 14:02.582
your principle of mastery,

14:02.782 --> 14:06.899
or you can say Guru Tattwa.

14:08.821 --> 14:12.902
You have to be truthful. First and foremost thing is that

14:13.102 --> 14:16.410
you should know the Truth, you should stand the testimony,

14:16.610 --> 14:21.071
and that you should announce it.

14:24.774 --> 14:28.959
The third thing a guru in Sahaja Yoga has to do

14:29.159 --> 14:33.190
is to develop detachment.

14:34.220 --> 14:38.528
Gradually you do develop it, because you find

14:38.728 --> 14:42.278
that, unless and until you develop that detachment,

14:42.478 --> 14:48.330
you are not receiving vibrations in full way.

14:49.407 --> 14:52.799
All kinds of detachments have to be developed,

14:52.999 --> 15:00.332
means your priorities change. Once your attention gets

15:00.533 --> 15:10.095
fixed up with your Spirit, the catch or the hold on things

15:10.296 --> 15:16.159
which are of no importance starts reducing by itself.

15:19.033 --> 15:22.476
For example, you have a father, you have a mother,

15:22.676 --> 15:25.812
you have a sister, this is a bigger problem in India.

15:26.012 --> 15:30.632
Here you are over-detached,

15:30.832 --> 15:34.427
but in India people are very much involved in their own children,

15:34.627 --> 15:41.528
in their own: “This is my son,” and others are all orphans.

15:41.728 --> 15:46.307
Only your sons are the real children, your daughter, your sons.

15:46.507 --> 15:50.242
“My daughter”,

15:50.443 --> 15:55.864
“I must do this for my son,

15:56.064 --> 16:00.333
for my father, mother”. Here also,

16:00.533 --> 16:05.249
two types of attachments are there, one through moha,

16:05.449 --> 16:11.223
through involvement into them;

16:11.424 --> 16:13.504
that you want to do this for them and that for them,

16:13.704 --> 16:15.981
and give all the property to them, insurance for them,

16:16.181 --> 16:20.082
every sort of thing. And another could be,

16:20.282 --> 16:22.738
the way we have here, that you hate your mother,

16:22.938 --> 16:27.563
you hate your father, you hate everyone.

16:29.452 --> 16:33.858
Both things are just the same.

16:35.693 --> 16:41.361
So a detachment must be developed.

16:41.561 --> 16:44.772
A detachment is that you are your father, you are your mother,

16:44.972 --> 16:48.533
you are everything, your Spirit is everything to you.

16:48.733 --> 16:55.456
You have to enjoy only your Spirit, as everything.

16:59.842 --> 17:02.034
Then the detachment comes from there.

17:02.234 --> 17:05.892
And then you really do good to them by detaching,

17:06.092 --> 17:10.066
because you see the complete vision about them

17:10.266 --> 17:12.910
and about what is to be done.

17:13.110 --> 17:16.824
For example, people have also attachments to certain crazes.

17:17.024 --> 17:21.749
Human beings always become crazy after something!

17:21.950 --> 17:26.168
I mean it can be anything.

17:28.584 --> 17:32.710
One has to understand [that] there should be only one craze:

17:32.911 --> 17:38.598
is to be settled absolutely into your Spirit.

17:40.210 --> 17:42.160
All other crazes will disappear,

17:42.361 --> 17:45.799
because that’s the greatest joy-giving thing,

17:45.999 --> 17:51.037
that’s the most nourishing thing,
that’s the most beautiful thing.

17:51.237 --> 17:54.834
So all the other things fall off, you enjoy only that,

17:55.034 --> 17:59.586
which is the source of all enjoyments.

18:00.547 --> 18:04.587
So you get yourself attached to your Spirit,

18:04.788 --> 18:08.991
detachment starts working.

18:15.535 --> 18:20.348
Sometimes detachment is taken as a license

18:20.548 --> 18:28.603
for becoming dry to others,

18:28.804 --> 18:32.062
which is absurd. This is only human quality also:

18:32.262 --> 18:36.804
[to] make everything ugly, whatever is beautiful.

18:37.004 --> 18:42.090
Actually, a person who is detached is the most beautiful person,

18:42.290 --> 18:47.626
is the extremely loving person. He is love.

18:50.693 --> 18:54.587
Look at the flowers, they are detached.

18:54.887 --> 18:57.051
They are dying. Tomorrow they are not going to live.

18:57.252 --> 19:03.079
But every minute they live, they are emitting fragrance to you.

19:03.279 --> 19:06.266
The trees are not attached to anything.

19:06.466 --> 19:10.826
They will die tomorrow, doesn’t matter.

19:11.026 --> 19:17.284
But anybody who comes to them, they give shade, they give fruits,

19:22.294 --> 19:25.797
Attachment means death of love;

19:25.997 --> 19:29.094
complete death of love is attachment.

19:29.294 --> 19:35.407
For example, in a tree, the sap rises, goes to all the leaves,

19:35.607 --> 19:38.974
goes to all the necessary parts, all the flowers,

19:39.175 --> 19:43.013
all the fruits, and goes back to the Mother Earth. He is not attached to anyone.

19:43.214 --> 19:47.401
Supposing the sap goes and gets attached into one fruit,

19:47.602 --> 19:52.209
what will happen? The tree will die, and the fruit will die.

19:52.409 --> 19:58.816
Detachment gives you the movement of your love, circulation of it.

20:02.547 --> 20:06.621
For things now.

20:08.184 --> 20:14.227
Things have no value unless and until there are emotions behind it.

20:15.742 --> 20:19.261
Now for example, a sari, this one I am wearing today,

20:19.461 --> 20:22.379
was bought for Guru day, Guru Purnima.

20:22.580 --> 20:27.203
But they had no sari. The other day
they wanted to have a sari for puja,

20:27.403 --> 20:31.234
so I said, “Alright, use this.”

20:31.434 --> 20:34.538
But I wore it again today, just to say that this was bought

20:34.738 --> 20:37.406
with that emotion that, on a Guru day, Mother would like

20:37.606 --> 20:42.633
to wear something of a lighter shade;

20:42.833 --> 20:47.977
white, the pure colour of silk.

20:48.178 --> 20:51.462
It’s complete detachment.

20:51.662 --> 20:55.223
But in white all the colours are mixed,

20:55.424 --> 20:59.283
then only it becomes white. In such a balance and unity it is,

20:59.483 --> 21:05.570
should be, that you become white, and whiter than snow.

21:05.771 --> 21:10.404
Detachment is purity, is innocence.

21:10.604 --> 21:15.685
Innocence is such a light, I tell you;

21:15.885 --> 21:21.188
light that really blinds you to all that is filthy.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.160
You wouldn’t even know that a person has come with bad intentions.

21:25.360 --> 21:28.897
You look at the person, somebody who comes to you

21:29.097 --> 21:32.983
and you’ll say, “Oh,

21:33.183 --> 21:35.571
come along! What do you want?”

21:35.779 --> 21:38.145
You’ll offer him tea and all that. And he’ll say,

21:38.345 --> 21:41.635
“I have come to rob you.” “Alright, rob me if you want to.

21:41.836 --> 21:43.925
It’s alright.”

21:44.125 --> 21:48.437
He may not at all rob you!

21:51.585 --> 21:54.557
That is what is innocence; which one can develop

21:54.757 --> 22:00.253
only through detachment. Detachment is of the attention.

22:00.454 --> 22:04.286
Do not allow your attention to get involved into something too much;

22:04.486 --> 22:06.965
even rituals of anything. Say, now,

22:07.165 --> 22:10.946
we have not washed Mataji’s Feet – alright, doesn’t matter.

22:11.146 --> 22:14.071
If you love me, alright! And if some mistakes are committed

22:14.271 --> 22:21.183
what does it matter? If you see on the abstract plane, it’s love.

22:23.142 --> 22:27.259
This is just a step forward.

22:29.150 --> 22:37.554
Like somebody ran very fast and fell down before reaching me

22:37.755 --> 22:40.531
and he says, “Mother, sorry I fell down before reaching you.

22:40.731 --> 22:43.883
I should have not done that.

22:44.083 --> 22:48.114
But see how I prostrated before you!”

22:48.948 --> 22:53.987
It’s complete poetry. Detachment.

23:01.181 --> 23:10.017
So one has to develop that detachment to be a guru.

23:11.232 --> 23:15.898
And that detachment doesn’t mean sanyasa or anything like that.

23:16.099 --> 23:21.156
Yes, sometimes one has to wear those dresses to announce because

23:21.356 --> 23:25.296
if you have to do [a] lot of work in a short time,

23:25.496 --> 23:29.835
then you have to take such intensive behaviour.

23:30.035 --> 23:33.685
Like Christ, we can say, Adi Shankaracharya,

23:33.886 --> 23:36.968
all these people had a very, very short life.

23:37.168 --> 23:40.788
And in that short life they had to achieve

23:40.988 --> 23:45.725
such a tremendous task that they had to actually take

23:45.925 --> 23:52.980
a military uniform,

23:53.180 --> 23:55.434
just to avoid problems; not to impress others.

23:55.634 --> 23:58.293
Nowadays people wear that dress just to impress others

23:58.493 --> 24:04.266
that they are detached, and do just the thing opposite of it.

24:06.196 --> 24:09.559
So we understand that,

24:09.760 --> 24:13.151
the first one [statute] is not to harm anyone, ahimsa;

24:13.351 --> 24:15.555
not to kill anyone.

24:15.756 --> 24:18.743
That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t eat meat and fish and all that.

24:18.943 --> 24:22.280
That’s all nonsense.

24:22.480 --> 24:25.120
Of course you should not hanker after food,

24:25.321 --> 24:27.120
no doubt about it.

24:27.346 --> 24:30.919
“You don’t kill anyone” means you do not kill a human being:

24:31.119 --> 24:35.320
“Thou shall not kill”.

24:37.594 --> 24:43.275
Just move forward so that they can sit there, a little.

24:43.475 --> 24:48.936
Come forward. I think best thing is to come very forward.

25:04.506 --> 25:09.393
So first thing is, not to harm anyone.

25:09.593 --> 25:12.455
Second is to know that you have found the Truth and

25:12.655 --> 25:17.265
give the testimony of the Truth.

25:20.360 --> 25:25.144
Third is the detachment, the way
I have told you about detachment:

25:25.344 --> 25:34.280
not to get attached to any one person
because he’s a relation or a something,

25:34.481 --> 25:38.036
but develop a universal feeling.

25:38.236 --> 25:43.326
And also not to hate anyone: that is even worse.

25:43.527 --> 25:48.226
That’s a kind of a worse type of attachment.

25:48.427 --> 25:52.308
This word should go away from the mouth of all the Sahaja Yogis:

25:52.508 --> 25:55.941
“I hate”.

25:57.623 --> 26:01.519
It’s called as a ‘dandak’, is the statute.

26:01.719 --> 26:06.019
You cannot hate anyone.

26:09.636 --> 26:17.660
Even rakshasas, you better not hate them. Give them a chance.

26:25.666 --> 26:30.834
Now the fourth thing, the fourth statute of the Lord is

26:31.034 --> 26:35.588
to lead a moral life.

26:37.836 --> 26:40.911
These statutes were given by all the Gurus,

26:41.112 --> 26:48.886
take them from Socrates onward; Moses, Abraham,

26:49.086 --> 26:55.109
Dattatreya, Janaka; up to say Nanaka, Mohammed Sahib,

26:55.310 --> 27:00.307
and take up to the point where it was only about a hundred years back,

27:00.507 --> 27:05.164
we can say, at the most, was Sai Nath.

27:09.761 --> 27:14.757
All of them have said that you have to lead a moral life.

27:14.958 --> 27:20.598
None of them have said that you do not get
married, that you do not talk to your wife,

27:20.799 --> 27:23.523
that you have no relationship with your wife.

27:23.723 --> 27:27.549
All this is nonsensical.

27:27.750 --> 27:30.402
Lead a moral life.

27:30.602 --> 27:37.394
When you are young, not married, keep your eyes on the ground.

27:40.615 --> 27:44.717
Mother Earth gives you that innocence by which

27:44.917 --> 27:48.026
you develop that principle within you.

27:48.226 --> 27:53.004
It’s a very important principle.

27:53.204 --> 27:58.623
It’s such a pure principle. It really helps the society

27:58.823 --> 28:01.398
to develop its dignity. Now think, in a society

28:01.598 --> 28:05.263
where you do not know who is your sister, who is your brother,

28:05.463 --> 28:11.965
who is your mother, what complications it can create.

28:18.155 --> 28:21.792
What confusion,

28:21.992 --> 28:25.260
what unhappiness!

28:25.460 --> 28:29.951
It is one of the most essential things for human beings to be moral.

28:30.151 --> 28:34.188
For animals it is not necessary.

28:34.389 --> 28:38.543
Most of the confusions and problems,

28:38.743 --> 28:41.098
specially in the Western life, have come because

28:41.298 --> 28:47.282
they have thrown morality in the sea.

28:49.263 --> 28:57.128
And to accept morality as the very basis of society

28:57.329 --> 29:01.920
is very difficult for them; it’s a complete reversion.

29:02.121 --> 29:07.264
But you have to do it. You have to turn the whole wheel back.

29:10.407 --> 29:14.836
So many things were done, in the beginning of the society,

29:15.037 --> 29:17.764
to establish this pure relationship.

29:17.965 --> 29:21.830
There are laws which act. As there are laws of,

29:22.031 --> 29:25.027
chemical laws are there, they have physical laws are there,

29:25.234 --> 29:30.163
in physics and chemistry if you read; there
are human laws which one should understand.

29:30.364 --> 29:33.194
The relationships between each other,

29:33.394 --> 29:35.781
the sublimity of their relationship,

29:35.981 --> 29:40.750
the purity of their relationship must be understood.

29:40.950 --> 29:46.616
And then only you can have a very, very happy married life,

29:46.816 --> 29:50.355
which is the basis.

29:55.911 --> 29:59.555
“Thou shall not commit adultery.”

29:59.756 --> 30:01.977
But Christ has said – perhaps He knew the modern people

30:02.177 --> 30:04.700
as they would be using their brains for this –

30:04.900 --> 30:09.852
He said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

30:10.843 --> 30:13.017
What a vision, in those days to think,

30:13.217 --> 30:16.366
I mean, even I could not understand it when I was in India.

30:16.566 --> 30:21.899
After only coming here I could see what did it mean.

30:22.099 --> 30:26.129
It’s a possession on the eyes, possession.

30:26.329 --> 30:35.761
It’s a joyless, useless behaviour.

30:35.961 --> 30:38.761
It’s tiring.

30:38.961 --> 30:42.691
Attention is frittered away completely.

30:42.892 --> 30:46.972
There’s no dignity.

30:50.836 --> 30:53.881
Eyes should be steady.

30:54.081 --> 31:00.421
When you look at somebody steadily,

31:00.621 --> 31:05.794
you should know that you have got Sahaja Yoga in you;

31:05.994 --> 31:10.391
with love, with respect, with dignity.

31:11.510 --> 31:14.990
Not staring at people and just playing into the hands

31:15.190 --> 31:19.244
of these possessions.

31:19.444 --> 31:24.088
The whole society is possessed.

31:24.794 --> 31:27.682
All the satanic forces have been let loose, I think.

31:27.882 --> 31:29.896
And the way people are possessed, they cannot see

31:30.096 --> 31:35.946
through these things. And they are supposed to be Christians.

31:41.803 --> 31:45.832
Attention is to be looked after.

31:47.133 --> 31:50.275
That’s the most important thing because [the] attention

31:50.475 --> 31:54.957
is the one which is going to be enlightened.

31:58.910 --> 32:05.582
So we have to know what morality is.

32:05.783 --> 32:07.835
Let people laugh at us. Let them say that,

32:08.036 --> 32:10.826
“These are goodie-goodies,” or this sort of a thing.

32:11.026 --> 32:14.112
We are. We are proud of it.

32:14.312 --> 32:18.521
We are not ashamed of being righteous people.

32:18.721 --> 32:23.530
This is a very important part of righteousness.

32:24.395 --> 32:30.572
Those who do not follow this will lose their vibrations very fast.

32:37.281 --> 32:42.200
Then, for a guru, he should not accumulate things.

32:42.400 --> 32:47.904
He should not have possessions, much possessions, with him.

32:48.104 --> 32:53.303
If he has possessions, they should be just for giving away.

32:55.065 --> 32:59.367
A guru must give away his possessions.

33:01.700 --> 33:07.027
He should not have a stamp-collection (laughter),

33:11.534 --> 33:14.216
and all kinds of collections that people have.

33:14.416 --> 33:19.671
Whatever things are useful, beautiful,

33:19.871 --> 33:25.433
which give happiness and joy to others, to their eyes,

33:25.633 --> 33:30.645
such things must be collected;

33:30.845 --> 33:35.598
such things which give the symbol to his life.

33:35.798 --> 33:41.439
Very symbolic things he should have,

33:41.639 --> 33:46.187
which suggest that he is a dharmic person.

33:48.595 --> 33:54.125
He should not have things which are symbolic of adharmic style,

33:54.325 --> 33:59.008
of irreligious life.

33:59.208 --> 34:05.176
Everything that he has or he wears, or he shows,

34:05.377 --> 34:10.277
should be representative of his dharma.

34:11.679 --> 34:15.050
I don’t know,

34:15.250 --> 34:18.985
I  don't know what was the situation here but, in India, when we were young,

34:19.186 --> 34:22.191
we were not allowed to listen to all kinds of music,

34:22.392 --> 34:26.416
not allowed, just not allowed;

34:26.616 --> 34:29.575
not to see all kinds of filthy things

34:29.775 --> 34:39.633
and filthy documentaries and things, not allowed.

34:39.833 --> 34:42.466
Anything that is impure, giving bad vibrations

34:42.666 --> 34:44.903
should not be possessed.

34:45.104 --> 34:48.341
And even, whatever you have, you should think:

34:48.541 --> 34:52.583
whom you can give this.

34:53.821 --> 34:57.502
So it means you should have possessions

34:57.702 --> 35:01.446
to express your generosity.

35:01.646 --> 35:05.969
A Sahaja Yogi has to be generous like the sea.

35:06.169 --> 35:09.001
A miserly Sahaja Yogi, I cannot think of that,

35:09.201 --> 35:16.889
it is like mixing of darkness with light.

35:17.421 --> 35:23.478
Miserliness is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

35:23.678 --> 35:27.002
Anybody whose mind goes, “How much I can save money?”

35:27.202 --> 35:31.097
or “Save my labour how?”

35:31.297 --> 35:34.646
There are many labour-saving devices also,

35:34.846 --> 35:39.536
and money-saving devices. Or cheating others,

35:39.737 --> 35:42.784
or making money out of certain few things here and there,

35:42.984 --> 35:47.212
all such things are against Sahaja Yoga.

35:47.412 --> 35:50.466
They will pull you down.

35:50.666 --> 35:54.178
Enjoy your generosity.

35:54.378 --> 35:59.569
How many times I must have told you about generosity.

36:00.545 --> 36:04.414
I remember once [that] I wanted to give a sari

36:04.614 --> 36:10.787
that I had from abroad.

36:10.987 --> 36:13.874
You see, because in India people like that kind of a sari very much;

36:14.074 --> 36:18.541
though I don’t understand why they like it,

36:18.741 --> 36:21.771
a nylon sort of thing.

36:21.971 --> 36:25.695
And a lady said that, “I haven’t got any sari from outside

36:25.895 --> 36:28.131
and I would like to have one imported sari.”

36:28.331 --> 36:32.735
And I had only one left with me because I am quite good at giving away.

36:32.936 --> 36:34.983
So I told one of my niece-in-laws, I said,

36:35.184 --> 36:37.544
“I want to give away this sari to her. On a holy day

36:37.744 --> 36:39.987
we can give it to elders, so I’ll give it.” She said,

36:40.188 --> 36:42.125
“You have only one left now, why do you want to give away?

36:42.325 --> 36:45.610
You have given away all you had.” I said, “Now, I feel like giving.

36:45.810 --> 36:49.016
I’ll give away.”

36:49.897 --> 36:52.022
And we were discussing this in the kitchen, you see,

36:52.222 --> 36:54.310
and I said, “Why do you tell me? I am not going to take

36:54.511 --> 36:57.372
your advice on this point.”

36:57.572 --> 37:01.122
And at that time the bell rang and a gentleman came.

37:01.322 --> 37:04.471
He had brought three saris for me from Africa,

37:04.671 --> 37:08.678
and one of them was exactly the same as the one I had.

37:08.878 --> 37:12.478
Because I had given some silk saris to this lady

37:12.678 --> 37:14.804
when she was going to Africa, she thought she should send me

37:15.004 --> 37:17.916
some saris, so she sent.

37:18.117 --> 37:20.935
You are just standing in the centre, from one door it comes

37:21.135 --> 37:25.459
and from the other door it goes. It’s nice to see all that movement.

37:25.659 --> 37:31.518
It’s very interesting. Apart from that, the way you give it,

37:31.718 --> 37:36.383
the emotional side of it, is so beautiful, you can’t imagine.

37:36.583 --> 37:41.337
I met a lady after, say, twenty years of her married life,

37:41.537 --> 37:44.694
in London suddenly,

37:44.894 --> 37:50.956
and she said, “Oh, what a coincidence!” I said, “Why?”

37:51.156 --> 37:54.083
“You see, I am wearing the same pearl necklace you had given me

37:54.283 --> 37:57.695
on my wedding day, today, and I should meet you!”

37:57.895 --> 38:00.227
And the whole thing, the whole drama changed, you know,

38:00.428 --> 38:05.307
that "I meet You." I mean it was nothing so great.

38:08.983 --> 38:14.902
It is how you give even a small thing.

38:15.102 --> 38:20.916
It’s the greatest art of giving one has to learn in Sahaja Yoga.

38:23.599 --> 38:25.978
Give up the mundane type of things, you see.

38:26.178 --> 38:29.436
Like if you go to somebody’s birthday, you send a card,

38:29.636 --> 38:33.018
“Thank you very much.”

38:33.218 --> 38:37.272
Make it a more deeper, significant thing.

38:37.472 --> 38:42.309
Let us see how you develop your symbols of love.

38:44.468 --> 38:49.482
And when you’ll have these things of vibrations,

38:49.682 --> 38:54.347
and then you’ll give it to a Sahaja Yogi, he will know what it is.

38:54.547 --> 39:00.946
Never lack in generosity, specially among Sahaja Yogis.

39:01.146 --> 39:05.200
Gradually you will be amazed how, through small things,

39:05.400 --> 39:08.629
you win over [others]; as if the vibrations flow

39:08.829 --> 39:13.384
through those things and work out on those people.

39:18.488 --> 39:26.440
Then, for a Sahaja Yogi, it is important to use things

39:26.640 --> 39:33.011
which are more natural in their character;

39:33.211 --> 39:40.053
to give up artificialities; to be more natural.

39:40.253 --> 39:42.927
I don’t say that you go and take out the roots and eat them,

39:43.128 --> 39:45.190
or you can eat the fish raw. I don’t mean that.

39:45.390 --> 39:49.031
I mean, going too far with things, always you must avoid.

39:49.231 --> 39:55.167
But try to lead a life which is more natural.

39:58.754 --> 40:05.760
Natural, in the sense that

40:05.960 --> 40:10.635
people know that there is no vanity about you.

40:12.842 --> 40:16.943
Or some people can be the other way round, you see,

40:17.143 --> 40:21.136
they will dress up like a tramp just to attract more attention.

40:21.336 --> 40:24.374
I mean they can be both ways, you see.

40:24.574 --> 40:30.391
Then I find some of the people, you see, colouring their hair and all that.

40:31.827 --> 40:35.883
Who is there? Let them come.

40:51.899 --> 40:54.222
Alright, let them go, let them go.

40:54.985 --> 40:58.143
Let them go.

41:00.357 --> 41:04.578
Put your attention here and we will work out.

41:06.681 --> 41:08.974
So you have to be a natural person;

41:09.174 --> 41:12.125
very natural in your behaviour.

41:12.325 --> 41:15.847
It can mean anything absurd also to some people

41:16.047 --> 41:19.768
who do not use their wisdom. Wisdom is very important in Sahaja Yoga;

41:19.968 --> 41:23.479
that one has to keep intact all the time.

41:23.679 --> 41:27.281
‘Natural’ means you must wear natural dresses

41:27.481 --> 41:31.343
which are suitable to you.

41:31.544 --> 41:36.376
For example, in this climate there is no need for you

41:36.576 --> 41:40.717
to wear a dress like Rama used to wear.

41:40.917 --> 41:44.484
He would not wear anything on top, you see.

41:44.684 --> 41:48.976
There is no need. You have to wear the dress

41:49.176 --> 41:53.452
to whatever country you belong,

41:53.652 --> 41:57.582
whatever suits you for the occasion.

41:57.782 --> 42:01.733
Whatever you think is dignified and good,

42:01.933 --> 42:13.848
which speaks for your more elegance and your personality.

42:14.628 --> 42:19.301
Whatever suits you, you should wear.

42:19.501 --> 42:25.422
Not like all the people wearing that Moss Bros dress,

42:25.623 --> 42:28.587
in the grey suit, a horrible looking,

42:28.787 --> 42:34.200
and absolutely making clowns out of them.

42:37.577 --> 42:41.623
No clownish things are necessary.

42:41.823 --> 42:45.228
No dandy stuff is necessary.

42:45.428 --> 42:50.966
Simple, beautiful dresses should be worn,

42:51.166 --> 42:55.277
which give you dignity.

42:56.902 --> 42:59.377
Actually in the East,

42:59.577 --> 43:03.202
people believe that God has given you a beautiful body

43:03.402 --> 43:08.901
and it is to be adorned with the beauty

43:09.101 --> 43:12.416
of what human beings have created

43:12.616 --> 43:17.550
just to respect it, just to worship your body.

43:17.750 --> 43:22.058
For example now in India people wear, women wear their saris.

43:22.258 --> 43:24.677
The saris are expressive of their moods of these women

43:24.877 --> 43:31.692
and of [the] expression of their worship of their body,

43:31.892 --> 43:36.265
because you must respect your body.

43:36.980 --> 43:41.614
Dresses should be such that should be for utility

43:41.814 --> 43:45.987
as well as dignity.

43:46.187 --> 43:50.059
There is no need to have uniform clothes for Sahaja Yoga at all.

43:50.259 --> 43:56.583
I do not like it. There should be variety, as the nature is.

43:56.783 --> 43:59.772
Everyone should look a different person.

43:59.972 --> 44:03.439
For a puja and all that you may wear something similar,

44:03.639 --> 44:07.259
doesn’t matter, where your attention need not be on the variety.

44:07.459 --> 44:10.323
But outside, you should be a normal person.

44:10.523 --> 44:13.148
You are all householders.

44:13.348 --> 44:18.440
Nobody has to announce something. Even you people, I do not tell you

44:18.641 --> 44:20.647
that you put on your red mark while walking on the street,

44:20.848 --> 44:25.242
because you should be like normal people, not to be pointed out.

44:25.965 --> 44:28.646
You need not be absurdly dressed or funnily dressed;

44:28.846 --> 44:33.209
in a normal way as others wear.

44:34.787 --> 44:39.422
To be normal is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

44:46.740 --> 44:51.874
Then we have to know that Sahaja Yogis have to get over

44:52.074 --> 44:57.128
all kinds of discrimination and identifications

44:57.328 --> 45:00.279
according to races, colour

45:00.479 --> 45:04.755
or different religions into [which] you are born.

45:04.955 --> 45:10.477
Because you are born as a Christian, you do not belong to a church.

45:10.677 --> 45:13.581
You were not born in a church,

45:13.781 --> 45:17.643
thank God (laughter).

45:18.651 --> 45:24.246
Otherwise all the spirits there would capture you immediately.

45:24.873 --> 45:29.665
But these identifications will linger on.

45:29.865 --> 45:32.545
To accept anything new, you are to be reborn,

45:32.745 --> 45:36.270
and you are reborn now.

45:36.470 --> 45:39.635
Now you are dharmateet, means you need not follow

45:39.835 --> 45:45.726
any particular type of religion.

45:45.926 --> 45:48.503
You are open to all the religions,

45:48.703 --> 45:53.553
and all the essence of religions you have to take.

45:55.100 --> 45:57.348
You are not to denounce any religion any time,

45:57.548 --> 45:59.477
to insult any religion any time,

45:59.678 --> 46:03.435
or to insult any religious Incarnation at any time, it’s sin.

46:03.635 --> 46:08.680
It is a great sin in Sahaja Yoga,

46:08.880 --> 46:14.404
any one of Them. And you know who They are.

46:20.841 --> 46:24.371
There should be no racial understanding of oneself.

46:24.571 --> 46:28.998
You could have been a Chinese or you could have been a Negro,

46:29.198 --> 46:33.015
you could have been anything.

46:37.772 --> 46:40.778
As long as we are all human beings,

46:40.978 --> 46:45.159
we should know that we laugh the same way,

46:45.359 --> 46:49.445
we smile the same way, we hold the same way.

46:49.645 --> 46:57.342
This is all conditioning in our mind of this society

46:57.542 --> 47:01.746
that some are untouchables, some are touchables.

47:01.946 --> 47:07.272
This is in our Indian community, horrible people.

47:08.876 --> 47:14.231
Brahmanism of India has ruined India completely,

47:14.431 --> 47:16.850
and you learnt from them.

47:17.050 --> 47:22.598
For example, who was Vyasa?

47:22.798 --> 47:26.321
The one who wrote Gita, who was he?

47:26.521 --> 47:31.869
He was illegitimate son of a fisherwoman.

47:32.742 --> 47:38.192
That’s why deliberately he was born like that.

47:38.392 --> 47:44.638
All these Brahmins who read Gita, tell them, “Who was Vyasa?”

47:45.828 --> 47:49.319
“Brahmins” are those who are Realised-souls, and for Realised-souls,

47:49.519 --> 47:52.763
there’s nothing like all these nonsensical things,

47:52.963 --> 47:58.860
like where are you born; in what caste and community you are born.

48:01.153 --> 48:04.176
With all education and everything in the West,

48:04.376 --> 48:09.687
you find this nonsense of racialism.

48:09.887 --> 48:13.306
I just can’t understand.

48:13.506 --> 48:16.877
If somebody is fair or dark, after all God has to make variety,

48:17.077 --> 48:19.901
in colour, in every way.

48:20.101 --> 48:25.458
Who told you that you are the most handsome people going round?

48:28.982 --> 48:32.953
Maybe for some of the markets here,

48:33.153 --> 48:36.826
or maybe in the Hollywood it may fit in.

48:37.026 --> 48:44.051
But in the kingdom of God,

48:44.251 --> 48:49.838
all these so-called handsome people will be denied entry.

48:50.261 --> 48:55.332
Marrying seven husbands and all sorts of things.

48:57.705 --> 49:01.094
They will be all put in hell.

49:01.294 --> 49:04.459
The beauty is of the heart and not of the face.

49:04.659 --> 49:08.730
And that shows and shines.

49:10.660 --> 49:13.484
I mean, people are a little bit aware of it,

49:13.684 --> 49:17.803
that’s why they go and tan their faces.

49:19.430 --> 49:21.722
I don’t know. They are quite aware

49:21.922 --> 49:26.200
that "it is too much showing off we are doing."

49:29.842 --> 49:35.547
But to have vanity, to have such absurd ideas,

49:35.747 --> 49:40.177
some people like red hair, some like black hair, some like this.

49:40.377 --> 49:42.835
I mean there have to be different types of hair.

49:43.035 --> 49:45.043
And why do you like a particular type of hair?

49:45.244 --> 49:48.661
This I can’t understand. There’s nothing like like and dislike,

49:48.861 --> 49:52.494
whatever God has created is all beautiful.

49:52.694 --> 49:55.185
Who are you to judge whether “I like this” and “I like that”?

49:55.385 --> 49:58.241
“I”, who is this “I”?

49:58.441 --> 50:02.670
Who likes is Mr. Ego, which is being pampered by this society;

50:02.870 --> 50:05.773
which teaches you how to smoke cigars

50:05.973 --> 50:10.810
and how to have your lager, morning till evening.

50:11.904 --> 50:15.514
All this training and all this conditioning has to be thrown away,

50:15.714 --> 50:18.727
just like filth.

50:18.927 --> 50:23.890
And see that God has created all of you as

50:24.090 --> 50:27.912
His own children. It’s such a beautiful thing.

50:28.121 --> 50:32.706
Why do you want to make it ugly with these ugly ideas?

50:33.809 --> 50:37.784
All this ugliness

50:37.984 --> 50:43.677
of “I like” and “I dislike” are nonsensical.

50:43.877 --> 50:48.526
Only there should be one word: “I love”.

50:48.726 --> 50:51.672
Forget everything.

50:51.872 --> 50:55.696
There’s no need to remember what British did to Indians

50:55.896 --> 51:02.181
and what Germans did to Jews. Forget it.

51:02.381 --> 51:04.641
Those people who did anything are dead and finished.

51:04.841 --> 51:08.856
We are different people. We are different people.

51:09.056 --> 51:12.849
We are saints.

51:15.325 --> 51:21.252
This is for your statutes, I have told you,

51:21.452 --> 51:24.127
which you have to imbibe.

51:24.327 --> 51:32.745
But today I authorise you to be the gurus,

51:32.946 --> 51:40.349
so that through your own character

51:40.549 --> 51:45.189
and through your own personalities,

51:45.389 --> 51:49.760
the way you practise Sahaja Yoga in your own life,

51:49.960 --> 51:55.677
and manifest the light, others will follow you.

51:55.877 --> 52:02.900
And that you will establish the statutes of Lord in their hearts,

52:03.100 --> 52:06.724
emancipate them, give them their salvation,

52:06.924 --> 52:11.177
because you have got your salvation.

52:11.377 --> 52:13.375
You are the channels.

52:13.575 --> 52:17.868
Without the channels, this All-pervading Power cannot work out.

52:18.068 --> 52:22.090
That’s the system. If you see the sun,

52:22.290 --> 52:25.855
its light spreads through its rays.

52:26.055 --> 52:32.895
From your heart the blood flows through arteries;

52:33.095 --> 52:36.518
they become smaller and smaller.

52:36.718 --> 52:40.867
You are the arteries which is going to flow

52:41.067 --> 52:47.031
this blood of My love to all the people.

52:47.231 --> 52:51.118
If the arteries are broken, it will not reach the people.

52:51.318 --> 52:56.972
That is why you are so important; very, very important.

52:57.172 --> 53:00.988
The bigger you become, the bigger artery you become,

53:01.188 --> 53:06.218
then you encompass more people.

53:06.418 --> 53:11.343
By that also you are more responsible.

53:16.224 --> 53:19.457
Guru must have the dignity, as I have told you last time.

53:19.657 --> 53:23.862
‘Guru’ means ‘the weight',

53:24.062 --> 53:28.299
is the gravity.

53:28.499 --> 53:32.330
‘Gurutwa’ means ‘gravity’. You must have the gravity,

53:32.530 --> 53:36.735
by your weight.

53:36.935 --> 53:43.098
‘Weight’ means the weight of your character,

53:43.298 --> 53:48.382
the weight of your dignity,

53:48.582 --> 53:55.962
the weight of your behaviour, the weight of your faiths,

53:56.162 --> 54:00.030
and your light.

54:00.230 --> 54:04.117
You become the guru not through frivolousness and vanity,

54:04.317 --> 54:12.766
cheapness, vulgar language,

54:12.966 --> 54:18.203
cheap jokes,

54:18.403 --> 54:22.236
anger, temper.

54:22.436 --> 54:27.110
All must be avoided completely.

54:30.134 --> 54:35.538
And with the weight of your sweetness,

54:35.738 --> 54:46.126
of your tongue, the dignity will attract people,

54:46.327 --> 54:51.531
just like the flowers when loaded with nectar attract

54:51.731 --> 54:54.785
the bees from all over.

54:54.985 --> 54:59.642
In the same way you’ll be attracting people.

54:59.842 --> 55:05.670
But be proud of that. Be very, very proud of that,

55:05.870 --> 55:09.781
and have sympathies for others and care for others.

55:09.981 --> 55:17.825
Now in short I have to tell you how you have to do it yourself,

55:18.025 --> 55:23.380
the ways of the Guru’s working.

55:23.580 --> 55:27.620
You have to work out your Void clearly.

55:28.739 --> 55:33.945
First of all, you have to know that the Void catches

55:34.145 --> 55:38.867
when you have a wrong type of a guru, you have had.

55:42.799 --> 55:47.498
You must know about your Guru entirely.

55:49.815 --> 55:56.133
Try to find out the character of your Guru.

55:56.333 --> 56:01.936
It’s rather difficult, because your Guru is very elusive.

56:04.832 --> 56:09.966
She’s Mahamaya, not easy to find out.

56:10.166 --> 56:13.710
She behaves in a very normal way,

56:13.910 --> 56:20.068
and sometimes you are outwitted.

56:23.828 --> 56:31.374
But you [should] see how, in small things also, how She behaves,

56:31.574 --> 56:34.612
how Her character is expressed, how Her love is expressed,

56:34.812 --> 56:40.003
try to remember all that, Her forgiveness.

56:41.328 --> 56:47.538
And then you should know that you have the Guru

56:47.738 --> 56:54.030
which many people must have desired to have,

56:54.230 --> 56:58.539
which is the Source of all the gurus.

57:03.285 --> 57:10.910
It is the ardent desire of even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha

57:11.110 --> 57:17.169
to have a Guru like that, and They must be all jealous of you.

57:17.369 --> 57:21.114
But this Guru is very elusive,

57:21.314 --> 57:30.052
so to improve your Void, say that: “Mother, You are our Guru.”

57:30.252 --> 57:32.267
Because of this elusiveness,

57:32.467 --> 57:35.358
that fear or that awe which is necessary,

57:35.558 --> 57:39.826
that respect which is necessary for the guru is not established.

57:40.026 --> 57:43.263
Unless and until you develop that awe,

57:43.463 --> 57:51.448
complete awe within you, your guru principle won’t develop.

57:53.408 --> 57:57.687
No liberty is to be taken.

57:59.179 --> 58:03.241
I am telling you myself, but I am extremely elusive.

58:03.441 --> 58:07.301
Next moment I’ll make you laugh and forget about it,

58:07.501 --> 58:13.499
because I’m testing your freedom to do it, complete freedom.

58:13.699 --> 58:17.965
I play with you in such a manner that you’ll be

58:18.165 --> 58:24.133
forgetting every moment that I’m your Guru, every moment.

58:32.141 --> 58:36.525
So first of all you must find out about your own Guru.

58:36.725 --> 58:41.610
Establish Her in your heart.

58:46.487 --> 58:48.747
I mean you have a wonderful Guru otherwise, I must say,

58:48.947 --> 58:53.409
I wish I had one like that (laughter).

59:03.683 --> 59:08.209
And She is desireless and sinless, absolutely sinless.

59:08.409 --> 59:11.344
Whatever I do, it’s not a sin for Me.

59:11.544 --> 59:15.376
I can kill anyone, do whatever intrigue or do anything.

59:15.576 --> 59:19.587
I really tell you, that’s a fact.

59:19.787 --> 59:23.746
Do anything, I am above sin.

59:23.946 --> 59:33.030
But I see to it that I do not do anything like that in your presence,

59:33.231 --> 59:39.297
so that you do not get one of these things, because that is my quality.

59:39.497 --> 59:44.416
You have a very supreme Guru, no doubt. But still,

59:44.616 --> 59:53.119
you must know that those powers of supremacy you don’t have.

59:56.976 --> 01:00:01.147
I am above all these things.

01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:03.536
I don’t know what are temptations are, nothing.

01:00:03.736 --> 01:00:07.520
I mean, I’ll do whatever I like.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.886
It’s all my will.

01:00:11.086 --> 01:00:13.814
But despite that, I have made myself very normal,

01:00:14.014 --> 01:00:17.981
and because I must appear before you

01:00:18.181 --> 01:00:22.920
in such a manner that you understand about these statutes.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:26.068
For me there are no statutes.

01:00:26.268 --> 01:00:29.565
I make all the statutes, isn’t it?

01:00:29.765 --> 01:00:32.454
Because of you I do all these things

01:00:32.654 --> 01:00:39.667
and teach you every small, small thing, because you are still children.

01:00:41.056 --> 01:00:44.195
In the same way, you must remember that

01:00:44.395 --> 01:00:48.257
when you are talking to other people about Sahaja Yoga,

01:00:48.457 --> 01:00:52.773
remember that they will see you all the time,

01:00:52.973 --> 01:00:55.765
and try to understand how far you are in it.

01:00:55.965 --> 01:00:59.000
As I understand you, you try to understand them.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.152
As I love you, you try to love them.

01:01:07.462 --> 01:01:10.802
I definitely love you, no doubt. But I am Nirmama,

01:01:11.002 --> 01:01:15.850
I am beyond love.

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:20.379
It’s a different state altogether.

01:01:26.323 --> 01:01:30.043
Under these circumstances

01:01:30.244 --> 01:01:32.989
you are better off, much better off,

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:39.436
because no guru ever goes to that extent.

01:01:42.635 --> 01:01:47.982
Apart from that I am the Source of
all the shaktis, of all the powers.

01:01:48.182 --> 01:01:53.274
So you can have all the powers from Me, whatever you like.

01:01:53.474 --> 01:01:57.750
I am desireless, but whatever desire you have will be fulfilled.

01:01:57.950 --> 01:02:01.660
Even about me you have to desire, look at that.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:04.922
How much I am bound by you.

01:02:05.122 --> 01:02:10.321
Unless and until you desire my good health, I’ll have bad health.

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:16.842
It is to that extent. But to me, what is bad health and good health?

01:02:19.771 --> 01:02:23.491
And under these beautiful conditions,

01:02:23.691 --> 01:02:27.412
you should really prosper so well.

01:02:27.612 --> 01:02:31.070
There should be no problem for you to be gurus.

01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:37.088
Now, the Void is to be established. First of all you must know your Guru.

01:02:39.405 --> 01:02:43.887
And She is on every Chakra working, imagine.

01:02:44.087 --> 01:02:48.309
And what a tremendous Guru you have.

01:02:49.928 --> 01:02:54.231
With that you will feel the confidence.

01:02:54.834 --> 01:02:57.594
And because it is such a tremendous Guru,

01:02:57.794 --> 01:03:01.531
everybody is getting Realisation so easily.

01:03:01.731 --> 01:03:09.021
If you go to a rich man, for him he’s
not going to give you 2p (£0.02).

01:03:10.338 --> 01:03:15.176
Because She’s so powerful,

01:03:15.376 --> 01:03:19.765
you are getting your powers just like that.

01:03:24.395 --> 01:03:29.576
So you have to feel very happy about it, extremely happy

01:03:29.776 --> 01:03:32.683
and beautiful that you have got all these powers.

01:03:32.883 --> 01:03:36.342
At least, those who have been in Sahaja Yoga will know this,

01:03:36.542 --> 01:03:38.612
for some time. Those who have come for the first time may be

01:03:38.812 --> 01:03:43.683
little bit puzzled with my lecture. All of you know.

01:03:44.723 --> 01:03:48.866
All of you know for definite what it is.

01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:54.910
So to understand your own Guru power,

01:03:55.110 --> 01:03:59.657
you must know who is your Guru.

01:04:02.388 --> 01:04:08.053
"Sakshat Adi Shakti. Oh God, it’s too much."

01:04:11.775 --> 01:04:16.140
Then establish your Void.

01:04:18.175 --> 01:04:20.921
A guru does not bend his head before anybody else

01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:25.123
and specially my disciples. Except for mothers and sisters and,

01:04:25.323 --> 01:04:30.561
you see, in some relationship if it is so, so you bow to that.

01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:37.816
But they do not bow to anybody else.

01:04:47.026 --> 01:04:52.223
And secondly, you must know that

01:04:52.423 --> 01:05:01.601
your Guru has been the Mother of very great people.

01:05:08.937 --> 01:05:13.404
The thought of them, itself,

01:05:13.604 --> 01:05:18.666
should establish your Guru Tattwa.

01:05:18.866 --> 01:05:26.830
What tremendous sons I have had, what great personalities.

01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:30.092
No words can describe them.

01:05:30.292 --> 01:05:35.356
And so many of them, one after another.

01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:42.933
And you are in the same tradition, My disciples.

01:05:43.133 --> 01:05:46.741
Keep them as your ideals.

01:05:46.941 --> 01:05:49.717
Try to follow them.

01:05:49.917 --> 01:05:52.294
Read about them, understand them, what they have said,

01:05:52.494 --> 01:05:58.599
how they have achieved such heights.

01:05:59.313 --> 01:06:04.623
Recognise them. Respect them.

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.134
You will establish your Guru Tattwa.

01:06:09.334 --> 01:06:12.904
Imbibe all the statutes within you, and be proud about it.

01:06:13.104 --> 01:06:15.611
Don’t be misguided by what people are talking,

01:06:15.811 --> 01:06:17.996
multitudes are talking.

01:06:18.196 --> 01:06:22.202
We are going to pull the whole multitude towards ourselves.

01:06:22.402 --> 01:06:27.290
First of all let us establish our weight,

01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:31.154
the gravity.

01:06:31.908 --> 01:06:36.986
As Mother Earth keeps pulling everybody towards Her,

01:06:37.186 --> 01:06:41.753
we’ll be pulling all of them to ourselves.

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:54.966
Today all of you must, within yourself, to your Spirit, promise

01:06:55.166 --> 01:07:04.229
that you will be a guru, worthy of your Mother.

01:07:04.429 --> 01:07:07.214
May God bless you.
