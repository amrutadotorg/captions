00:00:05.867 --> 00:00:08.860
Sahaja yogis should now

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.438
try to understand that they have to grow.

00:00:17.855 --> 00:00:22.604
Now this growth has to be two-sided.

00:00:34.062 --> 00:00:38.354
One is

00:00:39.563 --> 00:00:43.187
yourself,

00:00:44.438 --> 00:00:51.521
"How much time do I spend thinking about Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:56.938
and how much about my personal life,

00:00:57.312 --> 00:01:02.062
my education, my business, my duties,

00:01:02.438 --> 00:01:05.938
my jobs, my family?"

00:01:09.604 --> 00:01:12.062
Because it is important,

00:01:12.646 --> 00:01:17.479
as the brain has to think and Virata is there.

00:01:18.146 --> 00:01:21.479
So in Sahasrara,

00:01:22.354 --> 00:01:25.855
how much energy do we use

00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:31.062
to think about Sahaja Yoga?

00:01:31.813 --> 00:01:36.438
How can we spread Sahaja Yoga?

00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:39.521
What should we do?

00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:42.187
What should we work it out?

00:01:42.688 --> 00:01:46.730
How much I should support, in which way?

00:01:48.438 --> 00:01:54.438
How it can be my every moment living?

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.146
How I look at everything,

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.813
I see Sahaj working in it?

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.813
What is the Sahaj culture?

00:02:05.312 --> 00:02:07.813
Am I in the Sahaj culture?

00:02:08.312 --> 00:02:11.521
How much I'm impressed by other cultures

00:02:11.896 --> 00:02:13.688
and fashions and things?

00:02:14.104 --> 00:02:19.521
And what have I to gain,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.020
to grow in my mental capacity to be a Sahaj?

00:02:27.563 --> 00:02:33.021
For example, a person who is a Sahaj personality,

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.980
in everything he sees Sahaj, in everything,

00:02:36.312 --> 00:02:40.563
whether it is flowers, it's carpets, lights,

00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:45.229
statues, pendal, anything,

00:02:46.563 --> 00:02:49.855
it sees the Sahaj.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.604
How? See now, these pillars are standing at an angle;

00:02:57.062 --> 00:03:01.062
just imagine, to support it

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:05.104
how you had to bend on one side.

00:03:05.604 --> 00:03:08.021
What do we do in Sahaj?

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:12.855
We have to bend towards Divinity.

00:03:13.312 --> 00:03:19.646
See like that, all ideas go moving towards Sahaj.

00:03:20.312 --> 00:03:23.021
The whole thinking is Sahaj.

00:03:23.438 --> 00:03:24.896
Such a married life also

00:03:25.187 --> 00:03:26.646
between husband and wife I have seen.

00:03:27.021 --> 00:03:30.938
If both are Sahaj, they all the time talk of Sahaj

00:03:31.312 --> 00:03:35.479
- no frivolous talk, not useless talk, but only about Sahaj,

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.563
how it is Sahaj to be husband and wife,

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:43.187
what is the relationship,

00:03:43.563 --> 00:03:45.521
that's the most interesting in Sahaj.

00:03:45.896 --> 00:03:49.521
Like that, you see the everything that you do,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.020
you think on Sahaj way.

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.855
So now then you can judge yourself in this Mahamaya.

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:02.688
How far do you care really to think about Sahaj?

00:04:03.146 --> 00:04:05.187
But all other worries would be like this,

00:04:05.521 --> 00:04:08.688
"How much I will get money out of it?

00:04:09.062 --> 00:04:10.980
How much business I'll get?

00:04:11.438 --> 00:04:13.688
How much pleasure I can get?

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:20.187
How much physical problems can be solved?"

00:04:20.813 --> 00:04:24.688
All these gains are nothing

00:04:25.146 --> 00:04:29.604
compared to your maturity in Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:30.104 --> 00:04:31.521
But the mind takes over.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:34.563
It starts thinking and thinking,

00:04:35.104 --> 00:04:38.479
and it goes on wandering on various things:

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:44.312
maybe your wife, your children, your house, this, that.

00:04:46.062 --> 00:04:49.271
But if you think in a Sahaj way you'll think,

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.438
"I should do something that my children should be Sahaj.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.271
I should make a house which is useful to the Sahaj.

00:05:00.312 --> 00:05:04.563
I should behave in such a manner that I am Sahaj."

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.104
The maturity in you should grow

00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:13.479
in such a way that you can feel it.

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.688
Firstly is the peace.

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.688
When person is not peaceful

00:05:21.104 --> 00:05:26.396
his mind is like

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.730
a wobbly instrument.

00:05:32.187 --> 00:05:35.146
He cannot think properly, he cannot see properly,

00:05:35.604 --> 00:05:37.521
he cannot understand properly.

00:05:37.896 --> 00:05:41.896
You tell him something, he understands something else.

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.521
Now the whole world today is wobbly,

00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:49.229
whole world.

00:05:49.646 --> 00:05:53.062
Here this new party

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.104
has dismantled the other whole party in politics;

00:05:57.521 --> 00:06:00.020
it is this one is to be dismantled now.

00:06:00.396 --> 00:06:01.980
Everything is going upside-down.

00:06:02.354 --> 00:06:05.181
That too is through Mahamaya.

00:06:05.254 --> 00:06:08.629
Another very good aspect of Mahamaya is

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:11.837
that She transforms you.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.420
Everything is in the brain for human beings.

00:06:15.837 --> 00:06:19.254
If you are a crook, you're a crook in the brain.

00:06:21.254 --> 00:06:25.587
If you are a person who hates others, it's all in the brain.

00:06:26.462 --> 00:06:32.171
If you are a addict to something, it's all in the brain.

00:06:34.088 --> 00:06:39.295
It's a very complicated conditioning in the head.

00:06:40.462 --> 00:06:44.004
So this Sahasrara is very important, no doubt,

00:06:44.754 --> 00:06:51.088
but the power of Virata and Viratangana

00:06:52.253 --> 00:06:56.921
can only be effective if there is Mahamaya rupa.

00:06:58.545 --> 00:07:03.545
And She, in Her own sweet ways, opens,

00:07:04.963 --> 00:07:08.420
dislodges all these conditionings

00:07:09.213 --> 00:07:11.254
which make you ugly,

00:07:11.671 --> 00:07:14.712
which make you horrible,

00:07:15.295 --> 00:07:18.712
which makes you hot tempered,

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:22.420
non-Sahaja yogis.

00:07:23.004 --> 00:07:27.629
She's the one who really, like the Mother Earth,

00:07:28.254 --> 00:07:31.088
gives all that She has,

00:07:31.545 --> 00:07:38.295
to make you really very joyous, happy,

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:45.587
so that you enjoy nirananda - nothing but ananda,

00:07:46.921 --> 00:07:50.046
nothing but joy.

00:07:50.879 --> 00:07:55.254
And this is what is the Sahasrara.

00:07:55.671 --> 00:07:58.254
But it's only possible

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:04.254
when your brahmarandhra is to be opened out;

00:08:04.796 --> 00:08:09.088
otherwise you cannot enter into the subtleties

00:08:09.671 --> 00:08:13.712
of divine love, compassion,

00:08:14.213 --> 00:08:19.088
of that ever-flowing Mahamaya.

00:08:20.253 --> 00:08:23.253
From the outside I have told you what She is,

00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:29.253
but from inside when you enter, penetrate into Her

00:08:32.171 --> 00:08:34.213
through the brahmarandhra,

00:08:34.712 --> 00:08:39.587
then this Mahamaya which is an incarnation, as you know,

00:08:40.129 --> 00:08:43.629
of this all-pervading Power,

00:08:44.587 --> 00:08:47.504
becomes very different.

00:08:48.004 --> 00:08:52.129
On one side She tries to teach you lessons,

00:08:53.004 --> 00:08:55.462
She tries to destroy that is evil,

00:08:56.004 --> 00:08:59.129
all that is harmful, all that is destructive;

00:08:59.629 --> 00:09:05.088
and on the other side She loves you, protects you,

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:09.504
very delicately guides you.

00:09:10.337 --> 00:09:15.504
Her love is without any expectations.

00:09:15.921 --> 00:09:19.545
She loves because She cannot help but to love.

00:09:20.629 --> 00:09:23.879
So in that love you are drenched.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.837
You enjoy it.

00:09:26.253 --> 00:09:32.295
Everybody knows that they are close to Her,

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.253
absolutely close to Her.

00:09:35.671 --> 00:09:38.671
Whenever they want they can always ask Her help;

00:09:39.171 --> 00:09:42.712
wherever they are, they are supported by Her.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.253
So this Sahasrara is very important,

00:09:46.754 --> 00:09:49.754
because through this only we react,

00:09:50.295 --> 00:09:53.046
through this we accumulate

00:09:54.796 --> 00:09:56.545
all kinds of nonsense.

00:09:57.004 --> 00:10:00.046
In the world of this nonsense that we are living,

00:10:00.462 --> 00:10:03.420
we have to be something like the lotuses

00:10:04.046 --> 00:10:06.254
who cannot be tarnished,

00:10:06.837 --> 00:10:09.545
who cannot be affected

00:10:10.046 --> 00:10:13.420
by all the ills that are going on.

00:10:14.088 --> 00:10:17.295
This is what is the test, is the pariksha,

00:10:17.754 --> 00:10:19.921
that at this time,

00:10:20.379 --> 00:10:23.129
at this difficult time

00:10:23.754 --> 00:10:26.129
we can blossom

00:10:26.754 --> 00:10:29.587
and create fragrance,

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:35.213
and get so many others to this beautiful atmosphere.

00:10:36.337 --> 00:10:39.337
It is a kind

00:10:40.254 --> 00:10:46.712
of a beautiful, playful war, I - we can say,

00:10:49.213 --> 00:10:53.295
against what is supposed to be negative.

00:10:53.796 --> 00:10:56.254
What is the power of this negativity?

00:10:56.796 --> 00:10:58.921
What is the power of these conditionings?

00:10:59.379 --> 00:11:04.171
What is the power of this stupidity that anybody can see?

00:11:07.754 --> 00:11:11.295
So you develop the sight, the vision.

00:11:12.545 --> 00:11:16.046
So clearly, you understand so clearly

00:11:16.504 --> 00:11:20.420
that you are the ones who are responsible.

00:11:20.963 --> 00:11:26.420
You are the cells of this Sahasrara, of this brain,

00:11:26.963 --> 00:11:28.837
and you all have to act.

00:11:29.254 --> 00:11:32.129
I was yesterday enamored when you said

00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:37.004
that these lights have to enlighten many lights.

00:11:37.712 --> 00:11:40.671
This was really a great promise to Me.

00:11:41.171 --> 00:11:42.337
So coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:11:42.671 --> 00:11:47.004
is not just for your personal limited

00:11:47.837 --> 00:11:50.004
personalities and their problems,

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.754
but as I said, it's you

00:11:55.254 --> 00:11:57.379
on one side has to grow,

00:11:57.837 --> 00:12:00.671
and on the other side

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.004
everyone has to grow through you.

00:12:05.545 --> 00:12:10.004
So this is the second side which you should look after.

00:12:10.879 --> 00:12:13.545
Today of course I am very happy

00:12:14.046 --> 00:12:16.088
that in My lifetime I could see

00:12:16.545 --> 00:12:20.129
the manifestation of Mahamaya.

00:12:20.587 --> 00:12:22.587
It's such a beautiful one,

00:12:23.046 --> 00:12:25.629
that this door that is opened

00:12:26.295 --> 00:12:30.629
is now just

00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:36.004
able to enter into the Kingdom of God,

00:12:36.504 --> 00:12:40.712
and to enjoy the heavenly bliss and the protection.

00:12:41.254 --> 00:12:43.171
But have faith in it.

00:12:43.587 --> 00:12:45.462
Have faith in it.

00:12:45.879 --> 00:12:49.545
Do not get disturbed by small things,

00:12:50.004 --> 00:12:53.213
and I am sure it will work out in a very great way.

00:12:53.587 --> 00:12:58.254
If you get that complete faith

00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:06.088
and a complete surrendering,

00:13:06.796 --> 00:13:09.587
I am sure it will work out very well.

00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:11.762
May God bless you.
