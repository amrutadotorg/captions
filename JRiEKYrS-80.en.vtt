00:02.898 --> 00:06.523
SIGNIFICANCE OF HALLOWEEN

00:06.724 --> 00:12.898
IN THE TALKS OF SHRI MATAJI

00:22.256 --> 00:27.255
Or else if you have the puja on Saturday
evening it would be better idea.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.880
Chaya, Saturday... (question in Hindi)

00:30.040 --> 00:35.134
Sunday - you see. Let us have it
on Saturday evening.

00:35.335 --> 00:38.815
[Question in Hindi]
Yogini: Thirty-first.

00:39.016 --> 00:40.959
Shri Mataji: It will be alright.
Yogi: Yes, thirty-first.

00:41.160 --> 00:42.759
Shri Mataji: Thirty-first? Is it?
Yogi: Halloween.

00:42.936 --> 00:46.433
Shri Mataji: Eh? End of week. Yogi:
Halloween. Shri Mataji: Ah. Yogi: Yes.

00:46.634 --> 00:54.001
Shri Mataji: Hallo…? Yogi: Halloween,
Mother, it’s a festival… of doubtful origin.

00:54.202 --> 00:56.120
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogi: It’s a fest, a fest.

00:56.321 --> 00:59.196
Halloween is the abbreviation
of the term Hallow’s eve,

00:59.397 --> 01:02.919
because November 1st is supposed
to be All Saints’ Day.

01:03.120 --> 01:06.524
November 1st, so the last day
of October is Hallows’eve,

01:06.725 --> 01:09.683
it’s called Halloween. It’s supposed
to be the night when all the demons

01:09.884 --> 01:14.800
and witches fly through the sky on those
broomsticks, things like that Mother…

01:15.001 --> 01:18.495
When all the spirits take to the sky
on the night of Halloween.

01:18.704 --> 01:22.647
That's Saturday night.

01:23.329 --> 01:26.798
Shri Mataji: Then we should do it
on a Sunday day!

01:26.999 --> 01:31.492
Yogi: The children dress up, Mother,
and dress up as spirits,

01:31.693 --> 01:35.040
and ghosts, and they carry lanterns,
witches.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.319
Shri Mataji: Very bad.
Yogi: Witches too.

01:37.520 --> 01:40.760
It’s reputed to be a night when the spirits,
when the dead come out and...

01:40.960 --> 01:43.245
Shri Mataji: That’s the fourteenth of…
So we’ll have it on a Sunday then,

01:43.446 --> 01:47.352
it’s on a Sunday, Sunday. I would not
like to do that day.

01:47.553 --> 01:50.298
Yogi: Sunday is, Sunday is reputed
to be All Saints’ Day, Mother,

01:50.499 --> 01:53.266
the day of all the Saints, November 1st.
Shri Mataji: That’s good.

01:53.467 --> 01:55.344
Yogi: It's called All Saints' Day.
Shri Mataji: That’s a good day.

01:55.545 --> 01:57.835
Then we’ll have All Saints’ Day
plus Diwali day.

01:58.036 --> 02:02.318
Saints’ day, it’s good! So we’ll have it
on Sunday, all right?

02:04.494 --> 02:08.759
Then the fourteenth day is
very important,

02:08.960 --> 02:13.827
because that is the day the Goddess

02:16.540 --> 02:18.540
as a power, as a power,

02:18.741 --> 02:26.259
because it was Kartikeya who killed
Narakasura, the devil.

02:26.780 --> 02:33.827
And he was one of the worst of all,
could not be killed.

02:34.315 --> 02:40.347
So Shiva and Parvati were married
for this special purpose to produce

02:40.548 --> 02:49.551
this powerful Shaktiputra, means the son
of the Shakti, known as Kartikeya.

02:49.848 --> 02:57.661
And He was just born to kill this horrible
devil, called as Narakasura.

02:57.862 --> 03:02.504
And He killed. That is the day,
fourteenth day.

03:02.705 --> 03:05.426
It is something like Halloween,
that day.

03:05.627 --> 03:15.458
Because that is the day they open the gates
of hell and put all the devils into hell.

03:15.674 --> 03:21.184
And that’s why that day one has to rest
in the morning time as long as possible.

03:21.385 --> 03:24.944
So that let all the devils be put in
nicely

03:25.121 --> 03:29.912
because some of them might be
hanging around still.

03:30.113 --> 03:33.396
It’s better to allow them to get out.

03:33.597 --> 03:38.920
I mean, in the realm that you are
you do not feel much their existence.

03:39.121 --> 03:44.561
But if you were in the realm of subconscious
area or collective subconscious,

03:44.996 --> 03:49.084
people see even some of the spirits
and also can feel their existence,

03:49.285 --> 03:52.733
they see the black spots and all that.

03:53.238 --> 04:01.795
So that day is very dangerous, but
because Narakasura was killed,

04:02.941 --> 04:10.209
people celebrated. That celebration
is expressed next day,

04:10.433 --> 04:14.732
which that day is the day of Diwali
they say.

04:15.308 --> 04:20.389
It is America which needs Sahaja Yoga
much more than any other country.

04:20.574 --> 04:24.420
My concern for America is for
the same reason.

04:24.621 --> 04:30.092
I’m not saying so much about South America
but more about the North America.

04:30.293 --> 04:38.070
But even in South America, what
I found is that it is a kind of

04:41.328 --> 04:47.312
a nation where they have
no guidance at all

04:47.513 --> 04:50.719
about dharma, no guidance.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.944
Openly they are doing carnival,
this, that.

04:54.145 --> 04:59.490
I mean, how can you do it in a country,
all those things?

04:59.738 --> 05:03.639
They are following the footsteps
of North America.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.311
Like in North America they have
that Halloween nonsense.

05:06.512 --> 05:10.928
I mean, imagine openly on the street
doing Halloween nonsense.

05:11.129 --> 05:15.990
So they are following carnival. To them,
“Ah, what a thing it is to go to Rio,”

05:16.191 --> 05:20.159
as if there is a very big achievement
and going into that carnival

05:20.360 --> 05:25.115
from all over the places. From Australia
people are coming down.

05:27.785 --> 05:33.061
But the worst and the worst
and the worst is the Hollywood.

05:35.104 --> 05:43.798
Is the film industry. Under the name
of industry you can do anything.

05:45.444 --> 05:51.969
Now this Hollywood is creating
such horrible films,

05:52.130 --> 05:57.258
but the worst is that they get awards
for these worst films.

05:57.459 --> 05:59.658
There’s one film they showed,
I’ve not seen,

05:59.859 --> 06:01.601
I can’t see it.
(The Silence of the Lambs, 1991)

06:01.802 --> 06:07.665
They told Me that a man is a cannibal
and he is eating the flesh of human beings

06:07.866 --> 06:12.164
and they have shown and they enjoy.

06:13.397 --> 06:17.056
Very, very famous. Apart from that,
not only famous,

06:17.257 --> 06:22.812
but they got awards for the best film,
the best actor, the best devil.

06:23.207 --> 06:29.124
You must get a director from there and
make him eat the flesh of human beings.

06:29.325 --> 06:31.880
It’s the only way, I think,
this horrible thing...

06:32.065 --> 06:34.053
Then they are producing other
pictures.

06:34.254 --> 06:36.777
I’ve seen another one for a short time

06:36.978 --> 06:40.585
where they shows all dead bodies
hanging, you see.

06:40.786 --> 06:43.202
Horrible!

06:44.520 --> 06:49.709
Why these people like to see such
horrible things?

06:49.910 --> 06:54.062
What is their character? Where have
they gone?

06:54.263 --> 06:58.533
Why do they enjoy things which
no human being

06:58.734 --> 07:03.241
who is a human being will enjoy?

07:04.700 --> 07:08.504
And then it goes further.
Their Halloween business –

07:08.705 --> 07:13.730
I saw a film, I said, “My God.”
This is a hell in which

07:13.931 --> 07:18.494
they thought it was like the Ras
of Shri Krishna.

07:19.243 --> 07:23.853
So it was Krishna consciousness,
I think, that was working there.

07:24.054 --> 07:28.049
There are thousand and one things
which can shock you in America,

07:28.250 --> 07:32.993
and also in England, also in Europe.
