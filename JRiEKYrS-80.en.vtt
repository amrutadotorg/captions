SIGNIFICANCE OF HALLOWEEN

00:00:06.724 --> 00:00:12.898
IN THE TALKS OF SHRI MATAJI

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:27.255
Or else if you have the puja on Saturday
evening it would be better idea.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.880
Chaya, Saturday... (question in Hindi)

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.134
Sunday - you see. Let us have it
on Saturday evening.

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.815
[Question in Hindi]
Yogini: Thirty-first.

00:00:39.016 --> 00:00:40.959
Shri Mataji: It will be alright.
Yogi: Yes, thirty-first.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.759
Shri Mataji: Thirty-first? Is it?
Yogi: Halloween.

00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:46.433
Shri Mataji: Eh? End of week. Yogi:
Halloween. Shri Mataji: Ah. Yogi: Yes.

00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:54.001
Shri Mataji: Hallo…? Yogi: Halloween,
Mother, it’s a festival… of doubtful origin.

00:00:54.202 --> 00:00:56.120
Shri Mataji: Eh?
Yogi: It’s a fest, a fest.

00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:59.196
Halloween is the abbreviation
of the term Hallow’s eve,

00:00:59.397 --> 00:01:02.919
because November 1st is supposed
to be All Saints’ Day.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.524
November 1st, so the last day
of October is Hallows’eve,

00:01:06.725 --> 00:01:09.683
it’s called Halloween. It’s supposed
to be the night when all the demons

00:01:09.884 --> 00:01:14.800
and witches fly through the sky on those
broomsticks, things like that Mother…

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.495
When all the spirits take to the sky
on the night of Halloween.

00:01:18.704 --> 00:01:22.647
That's Saturday night.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.798
Shri Mataji: Then we should do it
on a Sunday day!

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:31.492
Yogi: The children dress up, Mother,
and dress up as spirits,

00:01:31.693 --> 00:01:35.040
and ghosts, and they carry lanterns, 
witches.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.319
Shri Mataji: Very bad. 
Yogi: Witches too.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.760
It’s reputed to be a night when the spirits,
when the dead come out and...

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.245
Shri Mataji: That’s the fourteenth of…
So we’ll have it on a Sunday then,

00:01:43.446 --> 00:01:47.352
it’s on a Sunday, Sunday. I would not
like to do that day.

00:01:47.553 --> 00:01:50.298
Yogi: Sunday is, Sunday is reputed
to be All Saints’ Day, Mother,

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:53.266
the day of all the Saints, November 1st.
Shri Mataji: That’s good.

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:55.344
Yogi: It's called All Saints' Day.
Shri Mataji: That’s a good day.

00:01:55.545 --> 00:01:57.835
Then we’ll have All Saints’ Day
plus Diwali day.

00:01:58.036 --> 00:02:02.318
Saints’ day, it’s good! So we’ll have it
on Sunday, all right?

00:02:04.494 --> 00:02:08.759
Then the fourteenth day is
very important,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.827
because that is the day the Goddess

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.540
as a power, as a power,

00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:26.259
because it was Kartikeya who killed
Narakasura, the devil.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.827
And he was one of the worst of all,
could not be killed.

00:02:34.315 --> 00:02:40.347
So Shiva and Parvati were married
for this special purpose to produce

00:02:40.548 --> 00:02:49.551
this powerful Shaktiputra, means the son
of the Shakti, known as Kartikeya.

00:02:49.848 --> 00:02:57.661
And He was just born to kill this horrible
devil, called as Narakasura.

00:02:57.862 --> 00:03:02.504
And He killed. That is the day,
fourteenth day.

00:03:02.705 --> 00:03:05.426
It is something like Halloween,
that day.

00:03:05.627 --> 00:03:15.458
Because that is the day they open the gates
of hell and put all the devils into hell.

00:03:15.674 --> 00:03:21.184
And that’s why that day one has to rest
in the morning time as long as possible.

00:03:21.385 --> 00:03:24.944
So that let all the devils be put in
nicely

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:29.912
because some of them might be
hanging around still.

00:03:30.113 --> 00:03:33.396
It’s better to allow them to get out.

00:03:33.597 --> 00:03:38.920
I mean, in the realm that you are
you do not feel much their existence.

00:03:39.121 --> 00:03:44.561
But if you were in the realm of subconscious
area or collective subconscious,

00:03:44.996 --> 00:03:49.084
people see even some of the spirits
and also can feel their existence,

00:03:49.285 --> 00:03:52.733
they see the black spots and all that.

00:03:53.238 --> 00:04:01.795
So that day is very dangerous, but
because Narakasura was killed,

00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:10.209
people celebrated. That celebration
is expressed next day,

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:14.732
which that day is the day of Diwali
they say.

00:04:15.308 --> 00:04:20.389
It is America which needs Sahaja Yoga
much more than any other country.

00:04:20.574 --> 00:04:24.420
My concern for America is for
the same reason.

00:04:24.621 --> 00:04:30.092
I’m not saying so much about South America
but more about the North America.

00:04:30.293 --> 00:04:38.070
But even in South America, what
I found is that it is a kind of

00:04:41.328 --> 00:04:47.312
a nation where they have
no guidance at all

00:04:47.513 --> 00:04:50.719
about dharma, no guidance.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.944
Openly they are doing carnival,
this, that.

00:04:54.145 --> 00:04:59.490
I mean, how can you do it in a country,
all those things?

00:04:59.738 --> 00:05:03.639
They are following the footsteps
of North America.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.311
Like in North America they have
that Halloween nonsense.

00:05:06.512 --> 00:05:10.928
I mean, imagine openly on the street
doing Halloween nonsense.

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:15.990
So they are following carnival. To them,
“Ah, what a thing it is to go to Rio,”

00:05:16.191 --> 00:05:20.159
as if there is a very big achievement
and going into that carnival

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:25.115
from all over the places. From Australia
people are coming down.

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:33.061
But the worst and the worst
and the worst is the Hollywood.

00:05:35.104 --> 00:05:43.798
Is the film industry. Under the name
of industry you can do anything.

00:05:45.444 --> 00:05:51.969
Now this Hollywood is creating
such horrible films,

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:57.258
but the worst is that they get awards
for these worst films.

00:05:57.459 --> 00:05:59.658
There’s one film they showed,
I’ve not seen,

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.601
I can’t see it.
(The Silence of the Lambs, 1991)

00:06:01.802 --> 00:06:07.665
They told Me that a man is a cannibal
and he is eating the flesh of human beings

00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:12.164
and they have shown and they enjoy.

00:06:13.397 --> 00:06:17.056
Very, very famous. Apart from that,
not only famous,

00:06:17.257 --> 00:06:22.812
but they got awards for the best film,
the best actor, the best devil.

00:06:23.207 --> 00:06:29.124
You must get a director from there and
make him eat the flesh of human beings.

00:06:29.325 --> 00:06:31.880
It’s the only way, I think,
this horrible thing...

00:06:32.065 --> 00:06:34.053
Then they are producing other
pictures.

00:06:34.254 --> 00:06:36.777
I’ve seen another one for a short time

00:06:36.978 --> 00:06:40.585
where they shows all dead bodies
hanging, you see.

00:06:40.786 --> 00:06:43.202
Horrible!

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.709
Why these people like to see such
horrible things?

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.062
What is their character? Where have
they gone?

00:06:54.263 --> 00:06:58.533
Why do they enjoy things which
no human being

00:06:58.734 --> 00:07:03.241
who is a human being will enjoy?

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.504
And then it goes further.
Their Halloween business –

00:07:08.705 --> 00:07:13.730
I saw a film, I said, “My God.”
This is a hell in which

00:07:13.931 --> 00:07:18.494
they thought it was like the Ras
of Shri Krishna.

00:07:19.243 --> 00:07:23.853
So it was Krishna consciousness,
I think, that was working there.

00:07:24.054 --> 00:07:28.049
There are thousand and one things
which can shock you in America,

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:32.993
and also in England, also in Europe.
