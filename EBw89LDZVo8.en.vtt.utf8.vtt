WEBVTT

00:06.509 --> 00:15.070
all the clashes all the problems of

00:11.049 --> 00:19.869
human beings are because they are not

00:15.070 --> 00:23.939
what they talk ideas are out out of

00:19.869 --> 00:23.939
their life

00:27.160 --> 00:35.170
that is how a sahaja yogi will show

00:30.490 --> 00:38.260
himself up compared to anybody else take

00:35.170 --> 00:40.660
an example say of Abraham Lincoln you

00:38.260 --> 00:43.750
know Abraham Lincoln believed that

00:40.660 --> 00:45.790
everybody must have freedom and the

00:43.750 --> 00:47.550
government should be for the public for

00:45.790 --> 00:53.500
the people

00:47.550 --> 00:56.860
whatever he talked he practiced whatever

00:53.500 --> 01:00.930
he believed in he worked it up and gave

00:56.860 --> 01:00.930
his life for that's why he's a great man

01:02.670 --> 01:08.910
take off Padma honey

01:05.399 --> 01:11.740
they were not like Christ's incarnations

01:08.910 --> 01:14.979
think of any great man think of Shivaji

01:11.740 --> 01:16.560
Maharaj any one of the Saints they were

01:14.979 --> 01:21.490
human beings

01:16.560 --> 01:23.710
but once they knew this is the principle

01:21.490 --> 01:25.179
on which we have to live they become one

01:23.710 --> 01:33.060
with the principles they do not

01:25.179 --> 01:39.450
compromise so what sahaja yogi has to be

01:33.060 --> 01:43.270
that we should understand a sahaja yogi

01:39.450 --> 01:46.720
is a person who has got realization

01:43.270 --> 01:50.770
through the Kundalini and Kundalini is

01:46.720 --> 01:55.780
the mother Houdini is the caring

01:50.770 --> 01:58.720
nourishing power but mother will never

01:55.780 --> 02:01.420
compromise with the son if he wants to

01:58.720 --> 02:04.479
kill somebody she say no I mean a real

02:01.420 --> 02:07.290
mother she will even shoot that sir who

02:04.479 --> 02:07.290
tries to do wrong

02:09.869 --> 02:16.300
we're the same way if you become the

02:12.460 --> 02:19.240
mother of yourself then you have to look

02:16.300 --> 02:23.560
after yourself in the same manner that

02:19.240 --> 02:25.690
you nourish yourself and all others also

02:23.560 --> 02:29.550
you have to nourish them care for them

02:25.690 --> 02:34.480
and do not compromise with wrongdoings

02:29.550 --> 02:39.209
unrighteous things absurd things so in

02:34.480 --> 02:39.209
your meditations you have to sit down

02:39.270 --> 02:49.030
now what do you say in meditation try to

02:44.260 --> 02:51.880
see all the chakras what chakras are

02:49.030 --> 02:58.140
catching face it yourself these might be

02:51.880 --> 03:02.500
from your past life sub chakras avi

02:58.140 --> 03:07.480
trying to make them all right try to

03:02.500 --> 03:09.850
strengthen them because ideals have to

03:07.480 --> 03:15.870
be worked out the instrument has to be

03:09.850 --> 03:22.269
ordered if the instrument is a crazy one

03:15.870 --> 03:24.130
how will you do so first of all you must

03:22.269 --> 03:29.280
develop your instrument toughening it

03:24.130 --> 03:29.280
should be balanced powerful not cowardly

03:29.880 --> 03:37.840
people should feel your power of course

03:35.500 --> 03:40.690
the power is of love but love doesn't

03:37.840 --> 03:43.269
mean that you compromise with all the

03:40.690 --> 03:44.940
nonsensical things there should be no

03:43.269 --> 03:47.910
compromise at all

03:44.940 --> 03:51.269
[Music]

03:47.910 --> 03:51.269
it's a very

03:54.500 --> 04:03.659
self-certifying state you cannot say

03:58.799 --> 04:05.700
when it is so you just cannot say itself

04:03.659 --> 04:09.629
the state will certify that I am alright

04:05.700 --> 04:12.989
now I have reached that state you cannot

04:09.629 --> 04:18.449
say and after five hours three minutes

04:12.989 --> 04:20.160
two seconds will become that you just

04:18.449 --> 04:28.349
mature and you see that maturity

04:20.160 --> 04:31.130
beginning once you understand that

04:28.349 --> 04:35.070
unless and until you become your ideas

04:31.130 --> 04:36.479
you are not a searchable everybody can

04:35.070 --> 04:40.820
call themselves a yogi there's no

04:36.479 --> 04:47.789
inaugural we don't have any sort of a

04:40.820 --> 04:51.300
inauguration of a university where

04:47.789 --> 04:53.550
people can come and get their degrees

04:51.300 --> 04:57.770
and diplomas alright you are certified

04:53.550 --> 05:03.150
Thais twice-born there are some work

04:57.770 --> 05:04.560
several times try spot that tries not

05:03.150 --> 05:07.220
today tomorrow they are not then again

05:04.560 --> 05:10.470
they come twice born again twice for

05:07.220 --> 05:15.180
some of them can be 108 times twice born

05:10.470 --> 05:19.320
in sahaja yoga and even then they are

05:15.180 --> 05:21.990
not certified so you have to give

05:19.320 --> 05:25.159
yourself a certificate there's no inner

05:21.990 --> 05:25.159
city to do that

05:26.360 --> 05:30.680
you have to understand yourself what are

05:28.610 --> 05:35.270
your problems why you are behaving like

05:30.680 --> 05:38.140
this you treat yourself as a child when

05:35.270 --> 05:40.280
it is needed you have to remove yourself

05:38.140 --> 05:44.510
when you have to glorify you should

05:40.280 --> 05:46.520
notify yourself so now you separate you

05:44.510 --> 05:49.490
become the mother the Spirit is the

05:46.520 --> 05:54.560
mother and you whatever you are which

05:49.490 --> 05:59.900
has to grow is the child mother is the

05:54.560 --> 06:04.190
idea she is the inspiration she is the

05:59.900 --> 06:06.740
power and the child is the recipe if the

06:04.190 --> 06:09.530
child is an obstinate fellow then you

06:06.740 --> 06:12.080
can't do anything about it also find out

06:09.530 --> 06:12.980
you might be one of them I know who are

06:12.080 --> 06:16.610
they like that

06:12.980 --> 06:18.940
there are many and you can find them out

06:16.610 --> 06:18.940
in no time

06:19.000 --> 06:27.890
obstinate fellows if they live with ten

06:23.510 --> 06:32.420
people suddenly we hear reports of their

06:27.890 --> 06:34.340
existence they are quite eloquent even

06:32.420 --> 06:37.130
if they are not talking a word people

06:34.340 --> 06:41.150
can't tell you I had a fight with such

06:37.130 --> 06:44.000
as such that person said such and such

06:41.150 --> 06:47.600
two thing to me that person was so cruel

06:44.000 --> 06:50.390
to me that person demanded this you know

06:47.600 --> 06:52.850
which person it is where you see as

06:50.390 --> 06:54.410
diamond can be made out thoughts can be

06:52.850 --> 06:58.310
made out also anytime you go near the

06:54.410 --> 07:01.430
thought anyone without exception it will

06:58.310 --> 07:06.440
bite everyone it is not going to spare

07:01.430 --> 07:07.910
it's a thorn so thorn has to me but if

07:06.440 --> 07:15.020
you are a sahaja yogi you have to be a

07:07.910 --> 07:20.520
flower and a strong power and an eternal

07:15.020 --> 07:24.240
flower that always grows does not feed

07:20.520 --> 07:28.370
always growing never feels such a flower

07:24.240 --> 07:33.990
you have then you will be surprised that

07:28.370 --> 07:41.789
you do not get into a trip of ego

07:33.990 --> 07:50.610
neither you go into a complete collapse

07:41.789 --> 07:52.530
of super so much you know that any one

07:50.610 --> 07:56.460
of you can be called as a scholar I can

07:52.530 --> 07:59.310
tell I mean so many times you can have

07:56.460 --> 08:03.560
asked me are they all scholars that you

07:59.310 --> 08:08.009
have your disciples you know so much

08:03.560 --> 08:12.289
much more than any saint ever knew I can

08:08.009 --> 08:19.199
assure but you know only in the brain

08:12.289 --> 08:21.630
outside it's all blah blah blah it's

08:19.199 --> 08:25.770
comes to the brain you use it to show

08:21.630 --> 08:28.229
off to others and finished it doesn't

08:25.770 --> 08:34.320
even settle down there now we need to go

08:28.229 --> 08:37.669
to that so everybody's talking babe they

08:34.320 --> 08:39.990
can impress people I mean if some

08:37.669 --> 08:42.120
journalist come here they'll be so

08:39.990 --> 08:47.660
impressed by the sahaja Yogi's so many

08:42.120 --> 08:47.660
wise men in England sitting down here

08:48.200 --> 08:58.920
but you laugh at yourself you have known

08:54.060 --> 09:01.100
all this because I've been speaking too

08:58.920 --> 09:01.100
much

09:03.390 --> 09:11.339
also the spirit is shiny

09:07.820 --> 09:14.550
let your spirit shine in such a way that

09:11.339 --> 09:19.709
people know this is a man who is

09:14.550 --> 09:22.950
completely integrated the spirit the

09:19.709 --> 09:25.769
talk the behavior the life itself is

09:22.950 --> 09:29.279
completely integrated and this is what

09:25.769 --> 09:31.290
it says Lara so if there is no

09:29.279 --> 09:39.450
integration you have not achieved your

09:31.290 --> 09:47.220
sister there will be no need to fill

09:39.450 --> 09:50.640
your ears and they should come when you

09:47.220 --> 09:56.640
all will raise your heads with great

09:50.640 --> 09:59.450
pride and glory because your ideas your

09:56.640 --> 10:02.970
writings will shine their condiments I

09:59.450 --> 10:05.850
want to say those days and all those who

10:02.970 --> 10:08.010
claim to be sahaja Yogi's become that

10:05.850 --> 10:10.709
that's the most important all other

10:08.010 --> 10:13.670
things are useless getting an ashram

10:10.709 --> 10:16.850
getting these doing this doing that

10:13.670 --> 10:16.850
forget it

10:21.670 --> 10:27.649
what you have to manage is this child

10:25.040 --> 10:31.839
which has to grow who is still naughty

10:27.649 --> 10:34.790
sometimes tries to misbehave now put it

10:31.839 --> 10:39.980
give it a name you call yourself a

10:34.790 --> 10:41.899
sahaja yogi and that child as mr. X mr.

10:39.980 --> 10:44.120
Y whatever you know your name has been

10:41.899 --> 10:47.480
and always try to turn now will you

10:44.120 --> 10:52.690
behave yourself get up in the morning

10:47.480 --> 10:55.970
have your bath sit down for meditation I

10:52.690 --> 10:59.240
feel lazy the child says I can't then

10:55.970 --> 11:00.980
you accept the child then the child will

10:59.240 --> 11:08.329
become the mother and you will be losing

11:00.980 --> 11:11.019
your powers excuses the child knows very

11:08.329 --> 11:13.250
intelligent it's a very clever child

11:11.019 --> 11:18.740
extremely intelligent knows how to

11:13.250 --> 11:23.620
deceive you but the child also knows in

11:18.740 --> 11:26.660
it what it needs if it comes to know

11:23.620 --> 11:29.690
that the mother in you has developed

11:26.660 --> 11:32.389
that personality when it accepts

11:29.690 --> 11:34.279
mother's personality but if the child

11:32.389 --> 11:38.779
knows the mother herself is read then he

11:34.279 --> 11:45.110
starts taking advantage of the water so

11:38.779 --> 11:47.440
you have to not fight yourself but to

11:45.110 --> 11:47.440
take

11:49.640 --> 11:54.860
and this is very easy you start enjoying

11:52.700 --> 11:57.769
it looking at yourself

11:54.860 --> 12:01.930
Oh mr. so unsure then you won't be angry

11:57.769 --> 12:04.700
I know how to handle you

12:01.930 --> 12:15.500
you are hiding behind there all right

12:04.700 --> 12:18.709
living its uses and the child was big so

12:15.500 --> 12:23.990
big that mother sees time and is amazed

12:18.709 --> 12:26.870
like in sri krishna's childhood the

12:23.990 --> 12:30.290
mother wasn't sure and the child was

12:26.870 --> 12:36.050
Shri Krishna is very symbolic I needs to

12:30.290 --> 12:39.800
play very naughty tricks and she said

12:36.050 --> 12:44.000
you went innate that mud from there I

12:39.800 --> 12:46.490
know you're weak so how can I eat how

12:44.000 --> 12:49.930
can i I can't even go out of the house

12:46.490 --> 12:53.959
I'm sitting down here where is the mud

12:49.930 --> 12:59.690
how can we you did eat I know you have

12:53.959 --> 13:03.410
it so better show me your mouth this is

12:59.690 --> 13:08.240
really and then the mouth opens and the

13:03.410 --> 13:12.829
complete which Russell come free to

13:08.240 --> 13:17.540
medium the hole which fans to see and a

13:12.829 --> 13:19.130
mother falls satisfied that's what she

13:17.540 --> 13:21.860
truth

13:19.130 --> 13:25.330
this mother has to fall at the feet of

13:21.860 --> 13:25.330
the child that has grown

13:29.310 --> 13:32.120
very soon

13:33.339 --> 13:43.199
that is how you have to move into that

13:37.980 --> 13:46.769
which resolved into that collective be

13:43.199 --> 13:46.769
into that Virata

13:51.350 --> 13:57.139
Arjuna and Shri Krishna is another very

13:54.199 --> 14:05.810
good symbolic thing Arjuna was a friend

13:57.139 --> 14:11.709
used to take liberties with Shri Krishna

14:05.810 --> 14:16.310
tried to tell him about Gita or these

14:11.709 --> 14:18.529
but still Shri Krishna could not

14:16.310 --> 14:21.800
convince him of that all these were just

14:18.529 --> 14:23.630
outside blah blah blahs as mother talks

14:21.800 --> 14:27.370
ah mother talks are very entertaining

14:23.630 --> 14:29.870
you know very humorous nice to hear them

14:27.370 --> 14:32.990
he's not listening to any music better

14:29.870 --> 14:34.910
to hear mother's talks and then the

14:32.990 --> 14:38.449
people think they're listening to mother

14:34.910 --> 14:45.980
they become mother already that's what

14:38.449 --> 14:47.690
happened to our analogy but see he said

14:45.980 --> 14:50.750
he found out that there's something

14:47.690 --> 14:52.970
lacking in that he has not become the

14:50.750 --> 14:58.399
idea till his attention is not there as

14:52.970 --> 15:03.079
it should have been so he asked Shri

14:58.399 --> 15:05.250
Krishna I think I'll see your great

15:03.079 --> 15:08.160
image

15:05.250 --> 15:11.819
I said all right are we prepared he said

15:08.160 --> 15:14.040
yes I'm prepared and then he became the

15:11.819 --> 15:17.129
we're after the vision of the we gotta

15:14.040 --> 15:20.940
and when he saw it he said stop it is

15:17.129 --> 15:24.779
too much for me that's what should

15:20.940 --> 15:29.310
happen to your friend who is this child

15:24.779 --> 15:31.740
that it should become that we dot when

15:29.310 --> 15:34.759
you see that should be amazed at

15:31.740 --> 15:36.930
yourself for God has grown like this

15:34.759 --> 15:39.720
just like I should have falling at the

15:36.930 --> 15:43.050
feet of the little child you have to

15:39.720 --> 15:47.810
fall at the feet of the child that is

15:43.050 --> 15:53.389
below I'm sure this will happen now so

15:47.810 --> 15:55.740
remember that no argument no explanation

15:53.389 --> 15:59.540
mother is forgiving she'll forgive you

15:55.740 --> 16:02.100
everything you know that anything you do

15:59.540 --> 16:08.459
alpha you even if you murder me and

16:02.100 --> 16:18.529
forgive me but you won't be able to

16:08.459 --> 16:18.529
forgive us allow that child to grow
