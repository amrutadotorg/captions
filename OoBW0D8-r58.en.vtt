00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.870
Diwali Puja. Los Angeles (USA), 9 November 2003

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.720
Today is the great day of Diwali.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.360
That means today is the great day .....(?)

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.280
lights of your heart together

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.360
to make a greater light

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.920
for the world to move in a proper direction.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.920
It's a day of great joy, and those who join in this,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.720
are spreading also great joy.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.760
But the problems are there, as they say,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.080
but for us there is no problem because there is no darkness,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.160
we don't see any darkness anywhere,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.360
we see lights, and lights, and lights.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:11.040
Then what is the thing missing, missing is our sincerity.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.440
We have to be very sincere with ourselves,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.040
because it is not just a borrowed love or a borrowed joy,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.560
but it is from within the source,

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.840
it's flowing, flowing and flowing.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.960
So that is to be awakened, and that love should flow,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.640
and our small petty things like jealousies

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.560
and competitions and all those things which spoil us

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.320
must be washed away.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.200
And it can be washed if your heart is full of love.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.840
Today is a day of spreading love, light of love,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.880
so that everybody feels enlightened and happy

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.120
and forgets these petty problems.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.960
I am happy that you have been able to get some hall,

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.880
it's all luck that we got it,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.640
people were so much worried about getting a hall.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.600
But it has just happened,

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.880
so you should know also that our destiny is all also

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.360
guided and looked after.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
You are already blessed people,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.400
there is no doubt about it.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.880
And we should not worry about small things and small matters.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.840
It will all work out very well, you will see,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.400
if you just leave it to your destiny, which is very high,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.840
very great - in this your own destiny you will go very far.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
This is the promise of Diwali

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.200
to you all, that you will reach highest

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.080
and the noblest way of life.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.320
Every word I say will be there

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.840
to prove what I say is there.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.120
Whatever petty problems you have,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.320
they'll all be washed off.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.840
All these are the messages from the Divine,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.240
you don't have to worry about petty things,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.800
about money, about jobs, that's not your job.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.480
Your destiny will work it out.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.120
You have a promise that you'll be looked after.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.440
I hope you believe in that promise

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.200
and are joyous in the highest way.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.320
I bless you all from my heart, all of you,

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.480
for a very happy and prosperous Diwali.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.520
Thank you very much.
