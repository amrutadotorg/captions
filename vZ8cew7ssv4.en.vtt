00:19:58.881 --> 00:20:01.037
Some of you cannot sit on the ground

00:20:01.238 --> 00:20:05.386
Can be some chairs from inside.

00:21:47.718 --> 00:21:55.548
Today, we have to something about the connection

00:21:55.749 --> 00:22:00.407
of Sahaja Yoga with this Mother Earth.

00:22:00.608 --> 00:22:02.407
It is very important,

00:22:02.608 --> 00:22:07.717
that we must understand the value of the Mother Earth.

00:22:08.616 --> 00:22:10.571
She has been very kind to all of you,

00:22:10.772 --> 00:22:13.368
She has been sucking your vibrations.

00:22:13.569 --> 00:22:16.248
She has been, otherwise also,

00:22:16.449 --> 00:22:21.568
She has given you everything that you see around.

00:22:21.769 --> 00:22:29.091
So today, we have to understand the connection,

00:22:29.292 --> 00:22:34.614
and the symbolic expression of the Mother Earth within ourselves.

00:22:34.815 --> 00:22:38.458
I have told you before also that

00:22:38.659 --> 00:22:42.060
Kundalini, which is in three and a half coils

00:22:42.261 --> 00:22:49.042
is placed within a triangular bone.

00:22:49.378 --> 00:22:56.036
Now this abode of the Kundalini is called as Mooladhara,

00:22:56.237 --> 00:23:03.458
and is represented in the universe as this Mother Earth.

00:23:05.495 --> 00:23:08.513
Or in the puja, it is represented as the Kumbha.

00:23:08.714 --> 00:23:11.714
I don’t know if you have made the Kumbha or not? Have you?

00:23:11.915 --> 00:23:16.440
Yes. The Kumbha is it here.

00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:30.569
So far, in the movement of our consciousness,

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:40.193
we have been trying to understand the God Almighty

00:23:40.394 --> 00:23:47.256
and all other five elements that we call as important.

00:23:57.346 --> 00:24:01.605
And also,

00:24:01.806 --> 00:24:05.558
the consciousness has been moving

00:24:05.759 --> 00:24:12.175
towards the understanding of

00:24:12.376 --> 00:24:17.985
all the other four elements but the Mother Earth.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:23.230
That had to be such, because unless and until

00:24:23.431 --> 00:24:28.964
the understanding of all these four other elements

00:24:29.165 --> 00:24:32.495
are brought to a certain degree,

00:24:32.696 --> 00:24:35.401
the Mother Earth cannot express itself.

00:24:35.602 --> 00:24:39.956
Like if all your chakras, four chakras, are caught up,

00:24:40.157 --> 00:24:42.940
you cannot raise the Kundalini,

00:24:43.141 --> 00:24:45.932
you cannot give Self-Realization.

00:24:46.133 --> 00:24:50.346
You cannot have a mass evolutionary process done.

00:24:50.547 --> 00:24:54.955
That’s why we had yagyas,

00:24:55.156 --> 00:25:00.564
all other methods of exciting the four elements.

00:25:00.765 --> 00:25:03.587
They worshipped the water

00:25:03.788 --> 00:25:10.616
and they worshipped air, the sky, the firmament, the light.

00:25:13.321 --> 00:25:16.639
And that’s how they came up to the time of Christ

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:22.050
where light was worshipped.

00:25:24.067 --> 00:25:29.702
But today when we are in this modern Sahaja Yoga,

00:25:29.903 --> 00:25:33.015
we are actually at the level of the Mother Earth,

00:25:33.216 --> 00:25:35.804
because this is the age of the Aquarius.

00:25:36.005 --> 00:25:40.671
And Aquarius is the same as the Kumbha—

00:25:40.872 --> 00:25:43.546
is the Mother Earth.

00:25:43.747 --> 00:25:48.715
So we are at the level of the Mother Earth.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:55.007
You can also see in the consciousness of human beings;

00:25:55.208 --> 00:25:59.226
I’m saying not only men, but women also and men.

00:25:59.427 --> 00:26:02.656
The consciousness is moving more towards

00:26:02.857 --> 00:26:08.258
the feminine expression of life.

00:26:08.459 --> 00:26:10.906
But as stupid as human beings are,

00:26:11.107 --> 00:26:15.164
the feminists also have been very stupid,

00:26:15.365 --> 00:26:20.097
that they are fighting on the level of rationality,

00:26:20.298 --> 00:26:24.933
of economics, of politics—all useless things.

00:26:25.134 --> 00:26:28.050
Equality on all these things if they are to be sought,

00:26:28.251 --> 00:26:32.308
you become men, you just become like men.

00:26:32.509 --> 00:26:35.115
If you are argumentative, if you are rational,

00:26:35.316 --> 00:26:39.435
if you talk like man, it’s a masculine development.

00:26:39.636 --> 00:26:42.756
But the Mothers development, the feminine development,

00:26:42.957 --> 00:26:48.045
is not equality in the way the men have been stupid.

00:26:48.246 --> 00:26:50.967
No use competing with men in their stupidity,

00:26:51.168 --> 00:26:53.934
the amount of stupidity has been created already for us

00:26:54.135 --> 00:26:56.536
quite sufficiently.

00:26:56.737 --> 00:27:00.427
The whole world is today, is expressing that nonsense

00:27:00.628 --> 00:27:05.560
that they have—the competition, the aggression, the oppression.

00:27:05.761 --> 00:27:08.958
So the other side of the woman, which was called as the

00:27:09.159 --> 00:27:14.488
dominated one, the dark side, the oppressed and all that

00:27:14.689 --> 00:27:17.118
has to express itself in a different way.

00:27:17.319 --> 00:27:21.462
The whole mode, the style, has to change.

00:27:21.663 --> 00:27:24.329
See now, in Christianity one should understand;

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:27.352
why Christianity, even Judaism, any religion,

00:27:27.553 --> 00:27:30.844
even Hinduism and all that

00:27:31.045 --> 00:27:33.795
but its more in Christianity, surprisingly

00:27:33.996 --> 00:27:40.170
they just had no place for Mary.

00:27:40.371 --> 00:27:46.311
And Muslims even crowned it by completely canceling Fatima.

00:27:46.512 --> 00:27:52.209
And on top of that,

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:56.693
you will see that among Christians, I think that ordination,

00:27:56.894 --> 00:28:00.476
or what you call that, is not given to the . . . to women,

00:28:00.677 --> 00:28:05.755
while Christ was not born of a man.

00:28:07.505 --> 00:28:10.921
But that does not in any way mean that you compete men

00:28:11.122 --> 00:28:16.486
in their foolish enterprises by which they have practically

00:28:16.687 --> 00:28:20.291
brought this world to such a ruinous state.

00:28:20.492 --> 00:28:26.518
So today we have to understand that it is the time for

00:28:26.719 --> 00:28:30.374
the motherly qualities to develop. Even a man,

00:28:30.575 --> 00:28:33.968
when he becomes motherly only, becomes a great man.

00:28:34.169 --> 00:28:41.054
Like Christ, when he had compassion, he was called as a saint.

00:28:41.255 --> 00:28:45.702
So the quality of a woman as a Mother—

00:28:45.903 --> 00:28:49.288
Goddess is always as a Mother—

00:28:49.489 --> 00:28:53.602
and She is the power most important to ignite Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:53.803 --> 00:28:56.696
Now how She ignites, I’ll tell you.

00:28:56.897 --> 00:29:00.305
I’ll give an analogy, but analogy should not be carried too far—

00:29:00.506 --> 00:29:04.907
as wise Sahaja Yogis you should not carry it too far.

00:29:05.108 --> 00:29:08.251
Say there is a zero, it has no meaning.

00:29:08.452 --> 00:29:11.978
In the same way God Almighty has no meaning,

00:29:12.179 --> 00:29:16.978
till you put some sort of one or two before it.

00:29:17.179 --> 00:29:20.025
It’s a zero. It has an existence

00:29:20.226 --> 00:29:24.525
but it has no capacity or a power to express itself.

00:29:24.726 --> 00:29:26.119
So it’s a zero.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:30.807
Like that we should say the masculine growth is a zero.

00:29:31.008 --> 00:29:33.557
Another analogy I will give you to understand it.

00:29:33.758 --> 00:29:38.995
That if you see

00:29:39.196 --> 00:29:45.198
very high power wires, going over your head,

00:29:45.399 --> 00:29:48.998
they are absolutely harmless, there’s no trouble.

00:29:49.199 --> 00:29:53.059
In Delhi there was a suggestion that there is a very big plot of

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:58.349
available where there are high power wires are going

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:02.693
and we can have it for free. I asked "What is the problem?"

00:30:02.894 --> 00:30:06.411
They said only, if earth gets connected with that

00:30:06.612 --> 00:30:10.036
then you will have problem.

00:30:10.237 --> 00:30:13.626
So till these-this high power thing, whatever it is—

00:30:13.827 --> 00:30:18.306
is not connected with the earth, it has no meaning at all.

00:30:18.507 --> 00:30:23.799
But earth is very different from this dynamic power

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.549
that is flowing through those wires, which are zero,

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:33.031
which mean nothing.

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:37.095
In the same way, in a woman,

00:30:37.296 --> 00:30:42.811
the womb of a woman is the Kundalini.

00:30:43.257 --> 00:30:46.869
Now what is a womb? Now, if that is the Kundalini,

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:49.494
that expresses the Kundalini in the gross;

00:30:49.695 --> 00:30:53.908
that means the Mother Earth is also like the womb.

00:30:54.109 --> 00:30:57.416
Now what does a womb do?

00:30:57.617 --> 00:31:02.236
It receives the sperm,

00:31:02.437 --> 00:31:06.454
which is just a frivolous act of man

00:31:06.655 --> 00:31:09.938
or you can say just an aggression,

00:31:10.139 --> 00:31:13.907
and she then nourishes -

00:31:14.108 --> 00:31:18.446
looks after it, corrects it

00:31:18.647 --> 00:31:22.993
and allows it to grow, not in an aggressive way

00:31:23.194 --> 00:31:27.446
but in a very compassionate and a sensible way,

00:31:27.647 --> 00:31:33.865
till it is expelled out of the womb when it is grown up.

00:31:35.147 --> 00:31:39.446
So the idea of womb is that the expression has to be

00:31:39.647 --> 00:31:44.884
in such a manner that it does not dominate.

00:31:45.085 --> 00:31:49.056
It does not dominate the embryo.

00:31:49.257 --> 00:31:51.697
If it dominates, how can it grow?

00:31:51.898 --> 00:31:55.705
So it nourishes it and makes it grow.

00:31:55.906 --> 00:31:58.400
This is what today’s Sahaja Yoga is.

00:31:58.601 --> 00:32:01.681
That now the Mother Earth is the one,

00:32:01.882 --> 00:32:07.072
who is symbolized within you as the Mooladhara,

00:32:07.273 --> 00:32:10.986
as symbolized as the AdiShakti here-

00:32:11.187 --> 00:32:14.791
is sitting down before you to nourish you,

00:32:14.992 --> 00:32:17.963
to make you grow into new personalities—

00:32:18.164 --> 00:32:21.796
into mature personalities.

00:32:23.117 --> 00:32:27.218
This concept we must understand.

00:32:27.812 --> 00:32:30.580
So the women of the West must understand

00:32:30.781 --> 00:32:33.324
that the nonsensical ideas they have taken from men

00:32:33.525 --> 00:32:38.769
must be completely discarded. They have to become women first.

00:32:38.970 --> 00:32:42.558
Those women who just are talking like men,

00:32:42.759 --> 00:32:46.535
can never help in Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:46.736 --> 00:32:51.957
They have to be like this Mother Earth who allows you

00:32:52.158 --> 00:32:54.410
to do what you like with Her.

00:32:54.611 --> 00:32:57.247
I mean you human beings have been so stupid

00:32:57.448 --> 00:33:00.177
to exploit Her to the maximum,

00:33:00.378 --> 00:33:05.769
not onlyt hat but also She

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:08.926
bears lot of nonsense upon Herself.

00:33:09.127 --> 00:33:13.606
But then a time reaches where She becomes explosive,

00:33:13.807 --> 00:33:18.864
then She starts consuming people inside Herself.

00:33:19.065 --> 00:33:22.044
And when She is consuming people

00:33:22.245 --> 00:33:26.302
then you see the earthquakes and droughts and this and that,

00:33:26.503 --> 00:33:31.357
all these things start coming in and people get engulfed

00:33:31.558 --> 00:33:36.232
into these problems

00:33:36.433 --> 00:33:41.018
which they blame Mother Earth for that.

00:33:47.303 --> 00:33:50.235
The problems that human beings have created

00:33:50.436 --> 00:33:55.243
out of aggressive nature—even aggression towards the Mother Earth,

00:33:55.444 --> 00:34:00.071
they have to pay dividend for that. And they are paying.

00:34:00.272 --> 00:34:04.266
Now, to stop this kind of a movement of aggressiveness

00:34:04.467 --> 00:34:07.110
which brings all kinds of disturbances,

00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:11.243
one has to recede back and should develop

00:34:11.444 --> 00:34:16.157
the sense of totality, of compassion.

00:34:16.358 --> 00:34:20.759
Unless and until, you understand totality,

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.087
the total, the complete, the whole—

00:34:23.288 --> 00:34:28.415
that’s the womb that’s your Mother.

00:34:28.616 --> 00:34:31.610
As long as you try to be individualistic

00:34:31.811 --> 00:34:36.305
you cannot be a good Sahaja Yogi.

00:34:36.506 --> 00:34:40.813
You have to become one with the whole.

00:34:41.014 --> 00:34:44.559
Now we have to face ourselves for that, very important it is.

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:48.239
Specially in the west, I would say we have to face ourselves

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.427
very clearly—what are we up to?

00:34:51.628 --> 00:34:55.557
That’s a very important thing.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:02.557
First of all let us see where is our attention.

00:35:03.245 --> 00:35:08.505
Ask a question. We are Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yogis

00:35:08.706 --> 00:35:13.169
within our fold

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:18.427
and I am sometimes surprised that even now,

00:35:18.628 --> 00:35:22.815
the attention can be very funny.

00:35:24.675 --> 00:35:27.935
Like, simple thing, like we can have attention

00:35:28.136 --> 00:35:31.792
on material things:

00:35:33.152 --> 00:35:38.287
"this is mine-this is yours;

00:35:38.488 --> 00:35:41.529
that I should have my privacy." Then you are gone into

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:45.435
the another realm of aggressiveness.

00:35:45.636 --> 00:35:47.755
If you try to have your own privacy,

00:35:47.956 --> 00:35:55.463
then you are depriving others of their privacy.

00:35:56.002 --> 00:35:59.374
It was all right when you were not Sahaja Yogis,

00:35:59.575 --> 00:36:01.921
to have your privacy, because you had to grow

00:36:02.122 --> 00:36:06.452
in your privacy at that time. But after Sahaja Yoga

00:36:06.653 --> 00:36:13.593
you have to become one with everyone else—

00:36:13.794 --> 00:36:16.929
that is very important. Before Sahaja Yoga

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:22.812
you were different and after Sahaja Yoga you are different.

00:36:23.013 --> 00:36:27.953
The whole concept must change after Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:28.154 --> 00:36:31.086
That now you have become one with the whole

00:36:31.287 --> 00:36:34.391
and to feel that you are one with the whole,

00:36:34.592 --> 00:36:39.805
you should try to give up all your individualistic attitudes.

00:36:40.006 --> 00:36:47.024
That’s very common now to hear "Yes, I like this, I like that."

00:36:48.552 --> 00:36:52.157
It’s very common: "I like it." Very common.

00:36:52.358 --> 00:36:57.654
But doesn’t behove a Sahaja Yogi to say such a thing.

00:36:58.725 --> 00:37:03.766
You see, how can I say that I like some thing?

00:37:03.967 --> 00:37:09.282
Think of a mother who has to bear the child,

00:37:09.483 --> 00:37:14.516
has to give birth to a child, has to look after the child,

00:37:14.717 --> 00:37:18.891
the needs of the child, protect the child,

00:37:19.092 --> 00:37:21.297
train the child. How can she say:

00:37:21.498 --> 00:37:25.802
"I like this" and "I like that"! Where is the time?

00:37:26.272 --> 00:37:29.391
To think what you like and what you don’t like,

00:37:29.592 --> 00:37:34.938
"I like this food, I like that food". Where is the time?

00:37:35.139 --> 00:37:38.438
Where is the energy left for that? Where is the attention?

00:37:38.639 --> 00:37:45.157
The attention is on the upbringing of the child.

00:37:45.358 --> 00:37:50.938
Now in the same way a Sahaja Yogi must know that

00:37:51.139 --> 00:37:56.211
the child within him is born—

00:37:56.412 --> 00:37:58.774
the Spirit.

00:37:58.975 --> 00:38:02.602
Spirit is the child

00:38:02.803 --> 00:38:05.422
which has been born within him,

00:38:05.623 --> 00:38:10.578
now he has to nourish, through the Kundalini.

00:38:10.779 --> 00:38:14.875
He has to water it, he has to look after it.

00:38:15.076 --> 00:38:18.578
It has to make it grow. Now where is the time

00:38:18.779 --> 00:38:21.867
for other nonsensical things? You have a child in hand.

00:38:22.068 --> 00:38:27.211
You are all mothers looking after your child—that’s your Spirit.

00:38:27.412 --> 00:38:31.203
So where do you have time for all these things?

00:38:31.404 --> 00:38:33.172
What attention should be:

00:38:33.373 --> 00:38:36.555
"What can I do to make this child happy,

00:38:36.756 --> 00:38:40.774
to make this child grow, to make this child

00:38:40.975 --> 00:38:43.626
completely manifest my self."

00:38:43.827 --> 00:38:47.165
The mother replaces herself

00:38:47.366 --> 00:38:51.110
as soon as the child becomes a mature child.

00:38:51.311 --> 00:38:53.665
So now in you, the Motherhood

00:38:53.866 --> 00:38:57.853
must take over than the Fatherhood.

00:38:58.054 --> 00:39:01.212
Motherhood towards yourself. The attitude should be

00:39:01.413 --> 00:39:04.048
like a Mother towards the child.

00:39:04.249 --> 00:39:06.712
How her attention is towards the child?

00:39:06.913 --> 00:39:11.751
You can see in every day-to-day life how we behave.

00:39:11.952 --> 00:39:16.478
I have seen people very much interested even now, in food.

00:39:16.679 --> 00:39:19.189
I mean, where is the time? Where is the attention?

00:39:19.390 --> 00:39:22.127
How can you be so much worried about your food?

00:39:22.328 --> 00:39:25.197
Worried about your sleep. Worried about your health;

00:39:25.398 --> 00:39:29.431
worried about this-that? I mean, here you are to worry about your child

00:39:29.632 --> 00:39:31.962
which you have got now within.

00:39:32.163 --> 00:39:35.517
And that’s why the child is neglected and sometimes you find

00:39:35.734 --> 00:39:40.749
the child becomes sick or sometimes goes into a coma

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:44.538
or may die away also.

00:39:44.739 --> 00:39:48.749
So the situation is very different now for Sahaja Yogis:

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:53.007
"how to treat themselves?"

00:39:53.208 --> 00:39:56.148
Those who are running after still food

00:39:56.349 --> 00:39:59.359
and all these nonsensical things. I mean have seen Sahaja Yogis,

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:04.106
all their attention is on food all the time.

00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:07.367
How dedication can come in a person

00:40:07.568 --> 00:40:12.927
who is so much dedicated to food habits?

00:40:13.568 --> 00:40:17.859
Like, we have seen,

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:21.468
you might have also seen—some of you—Ajanta caves were built.

00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:25.257
In ten generations they built Ajanta caves,

00:40:25.458 --> 00:40:29.663
ten generations! And

00:40:29.864 --> 00:40:34.272
they built it in a place where there was not even water available—

00:40:34.473 --> 00:40:37.280
to begin with.

00:40:37.481 --> 00:40:40.374
And day in and day out thousands of people,

00:40:40.575 --> 00:40:44.913
without getting any payment, without getting anything, built it.

00:40:45.114 --> 00:40:47.015
No food—no question!

00:40:47.216 --> 00:40:50.171
They used to eat some fruits somewhere here, there,

00:40:50.372 --> 00:40:55.114
but their dedication gave them power to do it.

00:40:56.552 --> 00:40:59.226
But this dedication can only be developed

00:40:59.427 --> 00:41:05.098
if you realize that you have to Mother your child.

00:41:07.637 --> 00:41:12.496
Now if the mother is ugly, the child will be ugly too.

00:41:12.697 --> 00:41:16.613
Because it is the mother who is expressed in the child.

00:41:16.814 --> 00:41:18.933
She doesn’t dominate the child all right,

00:41:19.134 --> 00:41:24.938
but she definitely can corrupt the image of the child.

00:41:26.142 --> 00:41:31.777
And that’s what exactly happens when we, the Sahaja Yogis,

00:41:31.978 --> 00:41:34.980
are not bothered as to look after our Spirit

00:41:35.181 --> 00:41:39.805
and our spiritual growth. Even now, you will be surprised,

00:41:40.006 --> 00:41:43.594
fifty percent people write letters to Me:

00:41:43.795 --> 00:41:46.672
"Mother I am still possessed,

00:41:46.873 --> 00:41:50.070
I have worked with lemons and chilies,

00:41:50.271 --> 00:41:53.484
I am coming to you for this and that."

00:41:53.685 --> 00:41:56.794
It is a very low-grade business. I think even after so many years

00:41:56.995 --> 00:41:59.613
if you are possessed, then I think you should beat yourself

00:41:59.814 --> 00:42:02.847
every day hundred and eight times.

00:42:03.048 --> 00:42:09.175
It’s a very low grade behavior, I personally think,

00:42:09.376 --> 00:42:12.738
that after your Mother has worked so hard with you;

00:42:12.939 --> 00:42:16.801
you are still just the same, coming back with the

00:42:17.002 --> 00:42:21.957
horrible idea of bringing

00:42:22.158 --> 00:42:27.134
all kinds of problems to your Mother.

00:42:28.713 --> 00:42:33.450
That means you have not looking after your child.

00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:36.723
Now in Sahaja Yoga it’s not a child

00:42:36.924 --> 00:42:40.098
which is an individual child you have to look after.

00:42:40.299 --> 00:42:45.036
This is, one should understand. This is where we miss very much,

00:42:45.237 --> 00:42:48.239
especially by the intellectuals.

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:52.411
They think it is their own child which should be all right,

00:42:52.612 --> 00:42:56.070
doesn’t matter about others’ children. Or, doesn’t matter

00:42:56.271 --> 00:43:00.812
if you have connection with others or not. It’s very common.

00:43:01.013 --> 00:43:02.803
Because, in the rationality gives them that sense,

00:43:03.004 --> 00:43:05.858
"Oh my spirits are all right, my vibrations are all right,

00:43:06.059 --> 00:43:08.691
so it is all right if I do not go to puja

00:43:08.892 --> 00:43:11.254
or if I do not go to any collective thing

00:43:11.455 --> 00:43:13.746
or if I do not support in any collective work

00:43:13.947 --> 00:43:18.355
or if I do not take any responsibility of Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:18.556 --> 00:43:22.996
Because once you become collective you take responsibilities.

00:43:23.197 --> 00:43:27.582
So you are over satisfied with yourself that is good,

00:43:27.783 --> 00:43:31.762
that I need not take up any responsibility.

00:43:31.963 --> 00:43:35.137
All the Sahaja Yogis are bad, or some of them are bad.

00:43:35.338 --> 00:43:40.614
I have nothing to do with them and this is that and that and that.

00:43:40.815 --> 00:43:46.994
But in Sahaja Yoga as it is, the Motherhood is universal.

00:43:48.065 --> 00:43:56.066
Because if you are the nose, say then somebody is the eye;

00:43:56.267 --> 00:44:02.399
if you are the ears, somebody is the lips.

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:07.981
So, it is essential for you to understand

00:44:08.182 --> 00:44:14.723
that anybody who is a Sahaja Yogi is in trouble,

00:44:14.924 --> 00:44:19.067
you are in trouble. Is threat to your growth;

00:44:19.268 --> 00:44:22.020
it is a threat to your growth, because it is the Whole that is growing.

00:44:22.221 --> 00:44:24.872
Of course, those who are absolutely useless

00:44:25.073 --> 00:44:29.802
will be thrown away, gradually. That’s what Mother does.

00:44:30.003 --> 00:44:35.779
They can be thrown away absolutely,

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.849
so much far away that they will never return.

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:41.677
But you don’t have to worry about such people,

00:44:41.878 --> 00:44:45.763
they will be thrown away. They will be given some chances,

00:44:45.964 --> 00:44:51.622
some more credits will be given, some graces will be given,

00:44:51.823 --> 00:44:54.552
but ultimately they will be thrown away. So you don’t have to worry.

00:44:54.753 --> 00:44:57.161
But you must worry about the Whole.

00:44:57.362 --> 00:45:01.333
And you have to take up the responsibility.

00:45:01.534 --> 00:45:05.731
Those who do not take up the responsibility

00:45:05.932 --> 00:45:11.317
are not the people who are yet matured their child—

00:45:11.518 --> 00:45:14.137
that’s the Spirit.

00:45:14.338 --> 00:45:17.473
Every type of responsibility that you can take,

00:45:17.674 --> 00:45:20.957
think of what responsibilities you can take.

00:45:21.158 --> 00:45:23.918
That is why most of us have bad Vishuddhis,

00:45:24.119 --> 00:45:26.824
because we do not take the responsibilities,

00:45:27.025 --> 00:45:29.871
and whatever responsibility we do take

00:45:30.072 --> 00:45:34.355
we have to be much, much, much more responsible

00:45:34.556 --> 00:45:39.985
than ordinary government servants are.

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:46.538
Sometimes we hear from one ear and throw it away from the same—

00:45:46.739 --> 00:45:50.856
don’t even allow it to come into the head.

00:45:54.153 --> 00:46:00.866
So, one has to understand that the child is your responsibility,

00:46:01.067 --> 00:46:03.179
you have to look after the child.

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:08.762
And the Whole is also your responsibility.

00:46:10.013 --> 00:46:15.914
Now, how to establish the connection between your Spirit,

00:46:16.115 --> 00:46:20.797
or keep the connection on between the Spirit and the womb,

00:46:20.998 --> 00:46:24.621
or the Kundalini,

00:46:24.822 --> 00:46:27.488
is the biggest problem that we all face:

00:46:27.689 --> 00:46:30.480
that our connections are very loose

00:46:30.681 --> 00:46:37.806
and that’s why this Kundalini cannot look after the Spirit.

00:46:38.142 --> 00:46:41.964
I wonder if you have noticed one thing in Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:42.165 --> 00:46:47.805
that you can maneuver the Kundalini, but not the Spirit.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.780
You can raise your hand, the Kundalini will move.

00:46:52.981 --> 00:46:54.936
You can maneuver it.

00:46:55.137 --> 00:46:58.702
You can give it a bandhan, it will go round and round and round.

00:46:58.903 --> 00:47:02.405
But what about the Spirit?

00:47:02.606 --> 00:47:04.928
You cannot maneuver it.

00:47:05.129 --> 00:47:07.930
There is only one mantra to awaken the Spirit,

00:47:08.131 --> 00:47:12.344
in the sense that to please him you have to say you are the Spirit.

00:47:12.545 --> 00:47:15.687
But you cannot maneuver it. You have to bring in Kundalini

00:47:15.888 --> 00:47:19.578
to look after it, you have to take Kundalini there,

00:47:19.779 --> 00:47:25.133
to the heart, so that this child

00:47:25.334 --> 00:47:29.133
which is the little offspring just now

00:47:29.334 --> 00:47:35.943
has to be carefully developed and matured.

00:47:38.383 --> 00:47:42.785
So on both the sides, of men or women,

00:47:42.986 --> 00:47:48.816
we have to understand, that if you are a man,

00:47:49.017 --> 00:47:54.004
and if you are dominating man, it’s all right.

00:47:54.205 --> 00:47:56.559
But if you are a woman and if you are dominating,

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:59.747
then it’s a difficult thing for Sahaja Yoga to cure you,

00:47:59.948 --> 00:48:02.435
because you have lost your quality of being a woman.

00:48:02.636 --> 00:48:05.466
At least you have to be a woman to begin with.

00:48:05.667 --> 00:48:08.309
If you are not even a woman, then what can you do with

00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:13.447
this third persons who are neither man nor woman?

00:48:14.049 --> 00:48:17.220
Now the men, when they are dominating, they have to understand,

00:48:17.421 --> 00:48:20.892
that they have to be compassionate.

00:48:21.093 --> 00:48:25.181
They have to be kind,

00:48:25.382 --> 00:48:31.392
they have to be considerate, but never subservient,

00:48:31.593 --> 00:48:35.448
never subservient. This is one should understand,

00:48:35.649 --> 00:48:38.831
that you should not be subservient.

00:48:39.032 --> 00:48:41.964
Now the women, what they have to be;

00:48:42.165 --> 00:48:46.777
is to be great, large, receptive;

00:48:46.978 --> 00:48:49.816
receiving

00:48:50.017 --> 00:48:53.188
and nourishing all that.

00:48:54.673 --> 00:48:58.143
Now the way husbands are told sometimes in this West—

00:48:58.344 --> 00:49:01.476
I am shocked.

00:49:02.547 --> 00:49:05.846
Wife says this to Mr. X, "X you haven’t done this,

00:49:06.047 --> 00:49:08.221
X you haven’t done that. How have you put this?

00:49:08.422 --> 00:49:12.330
Do this, do that, do that." It’s not woman’s way of doing it,

00:49:12.531 --> 00:49:16.857
it’s absolutely wrong that to do it.

00:49:17.058 --> 00:49:20.446
To tell him to do something.

00:49:20.647 --> 00:49:24.235
You are becoming a manly, and then we lose completely

00:49:24.436 --> 00:49:32.778
that power of giving that nourishment of a woman’s love,

00:49:32.979 --> 00:49:35.645
which is the power of a woman,

00:49:35.846 --> 00:49:39.575
which women don’t understand. I’ll tell you a simple example;

00:49:39.776 --> 00:49:43.590
My own grand daughter. She wants to be an air hostess all the time, she wants.

00:49:43.791 --> 00:49:46.168
She says, "You must have also thought of being an air hostess."

00:49:46.369 --> 00:49:48.621
I said, "Why? What is so great about air hostess?"

00:49:48.822 --> 00:49:54.290
She says, “That’s the only time you can give food to someone.”

00:49:55.838 --> 00:50:01.520
You see a natural instinct of a Mother that let me see them eat, you see.

00:50:01.721 --> 00:50:06.627
They don’t eat themselves, they want others to eat.

00:50:07.776 --> 00:50:11.513
But this is not in the conception of the western women, I tell you.

00:50:11.714 --> 00:50:13.451
They can’t understand this.

00:50:13.652 --> 00:50:16.646
"Why? I have done this, so why not he does this, this."

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:20.373
It’s your privilege to do these things properly,

00:50:20.574 --> 00:50:21.967
in a proper way.

00:50:22.168 --> 00:50:25.115
But supposing somebody is a very good mechanic,

00:50:25.316 --> 00:50:28.373
the woman will also become a mechanic, "I’ll do the mechanical things".

00:50:28.574 --> 00:50:30.568
She is not there for doing mechanical work.

00:50:30.769 --> 00:50:36.706
She is there for the mechanics of the emotions.

00:50:37.792 --> 00:50:40.161
On the contrary she just does the other way round.

00:50:40.362 --> 00:50:42.224
Like a man comes home; she goes on ordering,

00:50:42.425 --> 00:50:45.333
"You have to put that right, why did you spoil my carpet?

00:50:45.534 --> 00:50:49.747
Why did you do this? Clean it up, get that thing, do that."

00:50:49.948 --> 00:50:55.098
All his mechanics of emotions are finished.

00:50:55.299 --> 00:50:57.954
Once his mechanics of emotions are finished,

00:50:58.155 --> 00:51:01.629
he is useless and you are useless as it is.

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:06.798
And men also should not do their jobs. Let them do their own jobs.

00:51:07.385 --> 00:51:12.114
I think this is one of the biggest problems of the West today.

00:51:12.315 --> 00:51:18.442
That men are neither men, and women are not women.

00:51:18.643 --> 00:51:21.583
I find the quality so horrid,

00:51:21.784 --> 00:51:25.208
that I don’t know how to deal with the mixtures.

00:51:25.409 --> 00:51:29.903
You must understand this very simple thing in life

00:51:30.104 --> 00:51:33.208
that if you are a hybrid stuff,

00:51:33.409 --> 00:51:36.903
you can’t have the quality of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:51:37.104 --> 00:51:40.067
If you mix it up, it’s a very funny thing, isn’t it?

00:51:40.268 --> 00:51:43.915
So a woman must try to be a woman

00:51:44.116 --> 00:51:46.438
and a man must try to be a man.

00:51:46.639 --> 00:51:53.382
Now see, what is the situation, of a man,

00:51:53.583 --> 00:52:02.358
as a masculine effect on the development of consciousness?

00:52:02.559 --> 00:52:06.491
So, as the manliness was expressed

00:52:06.692 --> 00:52:10.434
we have developed science.

00:52:11.247 --> 00:52:14.694
We have developed all this knowledge,

00:52:14.895 --> 00:52:18.546
all these things which are outside.

00:52:18.747 --> 00:52:21.726
Now everything is ready.

00:52:21.927 --> 00:52:24.519
Now the woman has to come up.

00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:27.503
I mean, I am saying in the very abstract way; don’t think of woman,

00:52:27.704 --> 00:52:29.776
but you can say the feminine.

00:52:29.977 --> 00:52:33.854
The feminine nature has to rise now.

00:52:34.078 --> 00:52:38.197
Now everything is ready, it has to just spark.

00:52:39.688 --> 00:52:43.947
All the chakras are ready, now awaken the Kundalini.

00:52:44.148 --> 00:52:49.595
Kundalini is as important as the other chakras are.

00:52:49.804 --> 00:52:52.876
So now awaken the Kundalini. Now Kundalini’s behavior

00:52:53.077 --> 00:52:55.587
and mode of action is very different

00:52:55.788 --> 00:53:00.592
from the mode of action of the chakras.

00:53:03.939 --> 00:53:07.494
If the Kundalini becomes the chakras and the chakras become the Kundalini,

00:53:07.695 --> 00:53:12.589
how will you manage Sahaja Yoga? But we must assume

00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:16.753
our own nature in all dignity and in all pride;

00:53:16.954 --> 00:53:20.855
not to feel any way low down. Because a man sits on a horse,

00:53:21.056 --> 00:53:24.300
the woman wants to sit on a horse.

00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:27.777
What is the need for a woman to sit on a horse,

00:53:27.978 --> 00:53:30.668
I can’t understand. Here all the women are sitting on a horse.

00:53:30.869 --> 00:53:33.082
They’ll become like horses.

00:53:33.283 --> 00:53:37.871
Already I think half of your royal family looks like horses,

00:53:38.072 --> 00:53:40.816
don’t they?

00:53:41.017 --> 00:53:44.308
I think so. Their faces look like horses.

00:53:44.509 --> 00:53:47.066
See, so there is no need for women to do

00:53:47.267 --> 00:53:50.659
all the things that man have already done. Say, for example,

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:55.159
there’s one personality of masculine personality that has to come

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:58.776
and do a certain job. Now you’ve done it.

00:53:58.977 --> 00:54:01.540
All right now the another personality has to do this job.

00:54:01.741 --> 00:54:05.681
Now see the situation of the Divine also.

00:54:05.882 --> 00:54:08.498
Now the whole complication comes in that

00:54:08.699 --> 00:54:11.592
once a kind of a thing has been done,

00:54:11.793 --> 00:54:15.748
the another one that comes wants to do the same.

00:54:15.949 --> 00:54:18.068
Do you follow My point?

00:54:18.269 --> 00:54:23.136
So the whole energy is completely wasted.

00:54:23.911 --> 00:54:26.292
The whole preparation has been made

00:54:26.493 --> 00:54:29.206
for this Aquarius age to come in

00:54:29.407 --> 00:54:31.874
to bring in the Kundalini upward

00:54:32.075 --> 00:54:34.276
and to make the whole work out

00:54:34.477 --> 00:54:37.096
in such way that the left and right meet

00:54:37.297 --> 00:54:43.479
and you all become ignited enlightened

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:50.815
It was a question of our being sharing the whole job

00:54:51.016 --> 00:54:52.831
in a proper understanding

00:54:53.032 --> 00:54:55.019
Now see how Mother Earth Herself was created,

00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:57.707
it is also a very simple thing

00:54:57.908 --> 00:55:06.159
First, the movement of the energy started flowing.

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:09.425
Now this is a combined energy all right?

00:55:09.626 --> 00:55:14.034
Then the combined energy went round and round and round like that.

00:55:14.235 --> 00:55:19.018
And when it consolidated there was a-this big bang.

00:55:19.219 --> 00:55:22.635
When big bang took place—now this is the manly work,

00:55:22.836 --> 00:55:25.182
I should say in a way; manly style,

00:55:25.383 --> 00:55:28.745
because still the Mother earth is not produced—

00:55:28.946 --> 00:55:34.206
so then these little fragments again went round and round.

00:55:34.407 --> 00:55:36.503
With the momentum, they became roundish.

00:55:36.704 --> 00:55:39.847
Out of them the Mother Earth was selected for one job.

00:55:40.048 --> 00:55:42.644
Not to do anything - you keep quiet now.

00:55:42.845 --> 00:55:50.620
Alright. On the Mother Earth out of the water came the life—

00:55:50.821 --> 00:55:53.558
the carbon came in.

00:55:53.759 --> 00:55:57.878
Everybody helped there and a human being was created.

00:55:58.079 --> 00:56:01.155
Then the men went round, to improve their societies

00:56:01.356 --> 00:56:03.811
and whatever they have done to it, whatever was possible

00:56:04.012 --> 00:56:06.700
with their ego is done, finished now.

00:56:06.901 --> 00:56:12.185
Now they have done their job, you see. Now they are on dole,

00:56:12.386 --> 00:56:14.638
you can say.

00:56:14.839 --> 00:56:19.685
Now the womb, or we can say the Kundalini

00:56:19.886 --> 00:56:22.521
which has been waiting all these years, was resting,

00:56:22.722 --> 00:56:25.154
waiting for that time, isn’t it? So we call it:

00:56:25.355 --> 00:56:27.506
"the blossom time has now come".

00:56:27.707 --> 00:56:33.678
At that time the Kundalini has to rise and ignite,

00:56:33.879 --> 00:56:38.231
in such a way that the completion of the whole work takes place—

00:56:38.432 --> 00:56:42.486
it is simple. Do you understand now?

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:47.521
So there’s no competition between men or women,

00:56:47.722 --> 00:56:51.513
but the style of work is different.

00:56:51.714 --> 00:56:56.005
If you understand that, then only this kind of revolution

00:56:56.206 --> 00:56:58.505
will take place and not turn out a rebellion.

00:56:58.706 --> 00:57:01.739
Actually women are rebelling against men, and a nonsense it is.

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:05.356
It is such a headache, that you create something,

00:57:05.557 --> 00:57:08.198
allow them to grow, and the another party comes

00:57:08.399 --> 00:57:12.479
which has to complete the job starts rebelling.

00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:16.640
So the revolution has to take place and this revolution is only possible

00:57:16.841 --> 00:57:23.528
when we understand that what part is left out now to be done.

00:57:25.853 --> 00:57:28.941
Are you getting Me all right?

00:57:29.142 --> 00:57:33.089
So that part is now Realization,

00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:36.612
our awakening of the Kundalini.

00:57:36.813 --> 00:57:42.081
For that your feminine qualities are going to help you,

00:57:42.282 --> 00:57:44.635
not your masculine qualities.

00:57:44.836 --> 00:57:48.315
So aggressiveness must be given up by men.

00:57:48.516 --> 00:57:50.768
Also, because they are Sahaja Yogis now,

00:57:50.969 --> 00:57:53.940
they have to take feminine qualities. Not of fighting.

00:57:54.141 --> 00:57:56.831
If women fight they are not women.

00:57:57.032 --> 00:58:00.136
You see, women are told that

00:58:00.337 --> 00:58:06.988
"you are useless, you are good for nothing",

00:58:07.189 --> 00:58:11.636
so now they are trying to show, ‘no’, we are also all right.

00:58:11.837 --> 00:58:16.743
If you have eaten one crow we will eat three."

00:58:18.703 --> 00:58:30.047
Now, this understanding and the wise perception would be such that

00:58:30.248 --> 00:58:33.274
"what do we have to do now to change the mode

00:58:33.475 --> 00:58:35.805
and the style of our lives?"

00:58:36.006 --> 00:58:38.508
What’s wrong here?

00:58:38.709 --> 00:58:40.899
A turning point has come.

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:48.055
Now the evolution is not rebellion, at all by any chance.

00:58:48.256 --> 00:58:51.852
It’s a wrong idea people have. It’s not rebellion,

00:58:52.053 --> 00:58:54.385
that you hit me and I hit you—go on hitting each other,

00:58:54.586 --> 00:58:57.268
like a pendulum you move; you see the movement of a pendulum.

00:58:57.469 --> 00:59:01.041
It’s not like a boom, this thing—that today you are born as a Muslim,

00:59:01.242 --> 00:59:03.782
tomorrow you are born as a Jew, then you are born as a Jew,

00:59:03.983 --> 00:59:06.157
then you are born as a Hindu, then you are born as—

00:59:06.358 --> 00:59:10.470
it’s not pendulum. It is spiral movement.

00:59:10.671 --> 00:59:15.329
So every time you achieve an evolution

00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:17.517
you are at a higher level than before.

00:59:17.718 --> 00:59:21.595
So the movement is spiral—see My point?

00:59:21.796 --> 00:59:28.876
Now to achieve the higher position in our whole being

00:59:29.077 --> 00:59:31.032
what should we do?

00:59:31.233 --> 00:59:34.923
Is to understand that from this point to that point we have to rise—

00:59:35.124 --> 00:59:43.000
we have to rise in a way that we move in such a way

00:59:43.201 --> 00:59:51.408
that it is not in a pendulum way but in a spiral way.

00:59:51.792 --> 00:59:58.771
And to move spirally, you have to use another kind of force.

00:59:58.972 --> 01:00:03.591
Whatever you have used so far has to be endowed

01:00:03.792 --> 01:00:05.586
with another kind of force

01:00:05.787 --> 01:00:08.594
and that’s the feminine qualities of women.

01:00:08.795 --> 01:00:12.180
But where are the feminine women?

01:00:12.381 --> 01:00:16.336
They dress up like women, they will try to be feminine

01:00:16.537 --> 01:00:20.805
and all that. That’s not the way. From inside, from the heart.

01:00:21.006 --> 01:00:26.672
A feminine heart. Christ showed that in His life—

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:30.258
He forgave. Only a woman can forgive, man cannot,

01:00:30.459 --> 01:00:34.149
because he is aggressive. How can he forgive?

01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:38.172
Krishna never forgave anyone. He used to kill.

01:00:38.373 --> 01:00:45.826
Right royal fashion, go, all right? if you are so, all right. Done.

01:00:46.283 --> 01:00:49.293
He forgave to such an extent to show that

01:00:49.494 --> 01:00:54.176
He is now giving a turn to the spiral

01:00:54.377 --> 01:00:59.309
and now a feminine quality has to be developed among human beings.

01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:02.497
But that doesn’t mean that you start walking like women

01:01:02.698 --> 01:01:07.448
or developing waistlines.

01:01:09.948 --> 01:01:13.013
Because that’s another stupidity.

01:01:13.214 --> 01:01:16.513
But to be Motherly.

01:01:16.714 --> 01:01:20.669
Not to be fatherly, but to be Motherly.

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:24.474
That kindness, that gentleness

01:01:24.675 --> 01:01:28.544
should be in your behavior towards each other.

01:01:28.745 --> 01:01:33.060
Of course this force also corrects, sometimes also gets angry also.

01:01:33.261 --> 01:01:35.826
Mother also has to get angry sometimes,

01:01:36.027 --> 01:01:39.584
specially with people who never get all right with their behavior,

01:01:39.785 --> 01:01:42.123
She has to be shouting, punishing,

01:01:42.324 --> 01:01:46.607
and sometimes She also destroys; it’s all right.

01:01:46.808 --> 01:01:51.683
But that is sometimes, not all the time.

01:01:52.636 --> 01:01:58.052
So just now one has to accept that to be like the Mother Earth

01:01:58.253 --> 01:02:01.568
we have to be forbearing—Dhara.

01:02:01.769 --> 01:02:06.795
Daharaitey sadara. She is the sustenance of everything.

01:02:06.996 --> 01:02:11.951
She takes everything, the vibrations are sucked in; see, talk about it.

01:02:12.152 --> 01:02:14.717
And now for the first time after Realization,

01:02:14.918 --> 01:02:19.537
you can give Her back what you have got it, from Her.

01:02:19.738 --> 01:02:21.981
You can give vibrations to Her trees that are created, y

01:02:22.182 --> 01:02:26.994
ou can make them beautiful. You can transform a flower

01:02:27.222 --> 01:02:30.287
into a more beautiful flower.

01:02:30.488 --> 01:02:32.873
Now whatever you have got from the Mother Earth

01:02:33.074 --> 01:02:38.053
you can give because your Mother Earth is awakened within you now.

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:39.254
So you return Her back everything that you got from Her

01:02:41.547 --> 01:02:46.112
and give it to others. Generosity, the greatness of heart,

01:02:46.313 --> 01:02:53.292
nobility, forgiveness, love, affection, bearing everything for love.

01:02:53.493 --> 01:02:57.753
And for the mother, to save her child, she’ll starve herself,

01:02:57.954 --> 01:03:01.589
she’ll do everything to save her child,

01:03:01.790 --> 01:03:05.573
complete dedication she has for her child.

01:03:05.774 --> 01:03:09.160
That’s a real mother—I mean the kind of mothers you see these days,

01:03:09.361 --> 01:03:12.104
neither they are mothers nor women. But what I am saying,

01:03:12.305 --> 01:03:18.336
that’s the real image of a mother, and you have a image before you.

01:03:20.416 --> 01:03:23.673
So, this is what one has to develop now,

01:03:23.874 --> 01:03:26.657
whether you are men or women as Sahaja Yogis

01:03:26.858 --> 01:03:30.837
you must develop a new consciousness of affection,

01:03:31.038 --> 01:03:33.962
love and compassion.

01:03:34.163 --> 01:03:38.767
Getting angry, getting into a temper, shouting at people,

01:03:38.968 --> 01:03:43.423
screaming at people—is not going to help you much.

01:03:43.624 --> 01:03:46.212
If you have to help the whole, the growth of the whole,

01:03:46.413 --> 01:03:50.720
try to make yourself a milder person—

01:03:50.921 --> 01:03:53.993
be angry with yourself that you are losing tempers

01:03:54.194 --> 01:03:58.673
and you are so unkind to others.

01:03:58.874 --> 01:04:03.564
All the problems have come out of the over-growth of the masculinity—

01:04:03.765 --> 01:04:06.127
over-growth. It reaches a certain point, you see,

01:04:06.328 --> 01:04:11.632
it’s reached such a wretched point now, that it has to come down.

01:04:14.906 --> 01:04:19.332
But also femininity, at a lower level, without Realization

01:04:19.533 --> 01:04:24.105
could be very, very small hearted, chicken hearted,

01:04:24.306 --> 01:04:28.931
could be all the time worried about her own child.

01:04:29.329 --> 01:04:32.886
That’s what one has to change—

01:04:33.087 --> 01:04:37.949
is to have love and affection for every Sahaja Yogi,

01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:41.624
for every person. When it comes to fighting others

01:04:41.825 --> 01:04:46.226
you are all one but among yourselves you can look after each other,

01:04:46.427 --> 01:04:49.820
tell them—say for example, something is paining in my nose here,

01:04:50.021 --> 01:04:52.578
I will just try to rub it in the same way.

01:04:52.779 --> 01:04:57.984
But I won’t try to cut my nose will I? Or bang my nose, I won’t?

01:04:58.185 --> 01:05:03.129
So the feeling that the other is myself; be kind and gentle—

01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:06.660
try to improve and help in that manner.

01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:09.426
I hope you have understood the whole thing.

01:05:09.627 --> 01:05:13.315
In a nutshell is that: we have to change the whole mode—

01:05:13.516 --> 01:05:18.417
a radical change has to come in the society of Sahaja Yogis.

01:05:18.618 --> 01:05:23.899
Now, if there is any question you ask Me, before we start the puja.

01:05:26.118 --> 01:05:31.109
Now the problem of divorce and all that, you can see this.

01:05:42.217 --> 01:05:47.474
Left Nabhi problema, we can talk to.

01:06:14.973 --> 01:06:18.274
What is it?

01:06:23.568 --> 01:06:25.888
See.

01:06:27.466 --> 01:06:32.578
This problem comes in where you are not the whole.

01:06:32.779 --> 01:06:34.578
All right?

01:06:34.779 --> 01:06:38.726
Now supposing, as I told you, if you are the whole,

01:06:38.927 --> 01:06:42.677
then who is the other?

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.952
Then you will, even if you have to hurt. Say, for example,

01:06:47.153 --> 01:06:51.140
if there is blood coming out of my thumb,

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:55.546
I press it hard to stop the blood. It will hurt the thumb, thing.

01:06:55.747 --> 01:06:58.748
But the discrimination must be used, that I'm loosing my blood

01:06:58.949 --> 01:07:01.247
which is precious, much more precious than this finger

01:07:01.448 --> 01:07:04.666
it will hurt.

01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:08.223
But that discretion must be achieved, you see.

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:10.317
In Sahaja Yoga, you're all free to develop

01:07:10.518 --> 01:07:12.489
your sense of discretion.

01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:14.578
And once you develop your sense of discretion,

01:07:14.779 --> 01:07:17.133
gradually you will know what to do. In the beginning you will hurt,

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:19.774
no doubt, because you are used to that.

01:07:19.975 --> 01:07:22.391
I've seen people here, just barking at each other,

01:07:22.592 --> 01:07:25.586
as soon as they see each other they start barking.

01:07:25.787 --> 01:07:27.977
You go anywhere in the whole country you go anywhere,

01:07:28.178 --> 01:07:30.196
they start barking for nothing at all. I was surprised.

01:07:30.397 --> 01:07:31.618
In a school, I went there,

01:07:31.819 --> 01:07:34.063
there also everybody is barking at each other, you know.

01:07:34.264 --> 01:07:36.868
Whether they are drunk or not drunk, makes no difference-

01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:41.711
is the same state. But after Realization, you do say.

01:07:41.912 --> 01:07:46.555
Because you feel concerned, you're worried.

01:07:46.756 --> 01:07:51.594
But you say in such a way that you achieve the result.

01:07:51.795 --> 01:07:54.633
See My point is-that is the criteria:

01:07:54.834 --> 01:07:58.693
that you should achieve the results.

01:07:59.537 --> 01:08:01.938
But, supposing a man has come for the first time, and tell him

01:08:02.139 --> 01:08:04.672
that "you are a bhoot",

01:08:04.873 --> 01:08:09.000
then naturally he will be hurt;

01:08:09.201 --> 01:08:12.701
very common.

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:18.016
First day, somebody walks in and you say "you are a bhoot".

01:08:18.217 --> 01:08:20.050
I mean, thank God if he doesn't understand the meaning

01:08:20.251 --> 01:08:24.586
of the word bhoot -then it's all right.

01:08:28.554 --> 01:08:33.681
But first you think of being gentle, nice,

01:08:33.882 --> 01:08:38.939
embalming, sweet. Let's see, find out ways and methods;

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:42.041
there's a very good way-in the evening, to write down

01:08:42.242 --> 01:08:46.609
"how many sweet things I've said today."

01:08:51.687 --> 01:08:53.994
Not like this, sweet things we say,

01:08:54.195 --> 01:08:57.314
"You're looking beautiful" all that.

01:08:57.515 --> 01:09:02.546
Not the superficial ones. That may pamper the ego.

01:09:02.882 --> 01:09:05.853
But they're so sweet you know, things are.

01:09:06.054 --> 01:09:12.400
Let's say

01:09:12.601 --> 01:09:15.220
there are some very good words,

01:09:15.421 --> 01:09:19.772
you can say, like-"Are you warm enough?"

01:09:20.476 --> 01:09:24.470
-very sweet way of asking a question. Then, it's very simple;

01:09:24.671 --> 01:09:26.430
but you can say like that.

01:09:26.631 --> 01:09:30.125
Just-it's very difficult for people to say that even, I've seen.

01:09:30.326 --> 01:09:33.672
Looking after others comforts. Somebody is sitting, he wants water.

01:09:33.873 --> 01:09:37.616
Awkwardly sitting. You just go rush and given him water.

01:09:37.817 --> 01:09:43.476
Oh that's too much to expect. That, Oh God you gave water,

01:09:43.677 --> 01:09:47.679
"I'm not his servant"-immediately the question comes into the head.

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:51.843
Little bit trying to do something here and there.

01:09:52.044 --> 01:09:56.726
Or sometimes thinking-going in the market,

01:09:56.927 --> 01:10:00.460
you find something. "Oh let me take it for him".

01:10:00.661 --> 01:10:02.793
Children do. I've seen children all the time;

01:10:02.994 --> 01:10:09.869
they think of their friends-what they can buy for others.

01:10:12.061 --> 01:10:14.110
"This is good for my friend, this is good for..."

01:10:14.311 --> 01:10:15.946
She's very fond of things, she "likes. . ."

01:10:16.147 --> 01:10:18.493
All these little-little things, you know.

01:10:18.694 --> 01:10:20.626
Sometimes even a small thing

01:10:20.827 --> 01:10:22.228
like; early in the morning you get up,

01:10:22.429 --> 01:10:24.963
you find the another person is sleeping on one side,

01:10:25.164 --> 01:10:29.791
his blanket on the third side and his pillow in the fourth side.

01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:31.750
So you just put his head on the pillow

01:10:31.951 --> 01:10:36.242
and cover him with the blanket. That's mother's job.

01:10:39.585 --> 01:10:44.538
Not out of fear, but out of sheer love.

01:10:46.512 --> 01:10:49.303
Like even if it is cold and buttons are open,

01:10:49.504 --> 01:10:53.717
you can button up a person you like. Little-little things you know.

01:10:53.918 --> 01:10:56.530
Women have very little-sweet things which they do,

01:10:56.731 --> 01:11:02.645
which makes men very happy. But women have lost now, that sense.

01:11:07.125 --> 01:11:09.289
Not the fighting, but thinking of

01:11:09.490 --> 01:11:11.797
what sweet things you can do for him.

01:11:11.998 --> 01:11:16.130
And also, sometimes teasing is all right.

01:11:17.732 --> 01:11:21.101
Sometimes tickling is all right.

01:11:21.302 --> 01:11:27.593
But a kind of a sweet you see rapport between each other;

01:11:27.794 --> 01:11:33.567
even the feeling, that we can do that. It's a master's job.

01:11:34.271 --> 01:11:37.229
Is a master's job. The one who is a master can do it,

01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:39.576
those who are not, will not be able to.

01:11:39.777 --> 01:11:42.459
They'll again come back to hurt. Ultimately, they'll land up

01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:46.225
with hurting or biting or coming to blows.

01:11:46.426 --> 01:11:49.374
But those who are masters will be so beautifully doing

01:11:49.575 --> 01:11:55.444
the whole job that you see a kind of a very sweet relationship-

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:57.297
it's called Madhurya. Without any lust,

01:11:57.498 --> 01:12:02.266
without any money-business, anything. Such sweet relationships.

01:12:02.467 --> 01:12:06.771
And the joy would be bubbling.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.649
All these perversions, all these things will drop off.

01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:15.350
But a very sweet relationship-

01:12:20.428 --> 01:12:26.295
all right? Even saying that, you are feeling happy.
