WEBVTT

19:58.881 --> 20:01.037
Some of you cannot sit on the ground

20:01.238 --> 20:05.386
Can be some chairs from inside.

21:47.718 --> 21:55.548
Today, we have to something about the connection

21:55.749 --> 22:00.407
of Sahaja Yoga with this Mother Earth.

22:00.608 --> 22:02.407
It is very important,

22:02.608 --> 22:07.717
that we must understand the value of the Mother Earth.

22:08.616 --> 22:10.571
She has been very kind to all of you,

22:10.772 --> 22:13.368
She has been sucking your vibrations.

22:13.569 --> 22:16.248
She has been, otherwise also,

22:16.449 --> 22:21.568
She has given you everything that you see around.

22:21.769 --> 22:29.091
So today, we have to understand the connection,

22:29.292 --> 22:34.614
and the symbolic expression of the Mother Earth within ourselves.

22:34.815 --> 22:38.458
I have told you before also that

22:38.659 --> 22:42.060
Kundalini, which is in three and a half coils

22:42.261 --> 22:49.042
is placed within a triangular bone.

22:49.378 --> 22:56.036
Now this abode of the Kundalini is called as Mooladhara,

22:56.237 --> 23:03.458
and is represented in the universe as this Mother Earth.

23:05.495 --> 23:08.513
Or in the puja, it is represented as the Kumbha.

23:08.714 --> 23:11.714
I don’t know if you have made the Kumbha or not? Have you?

23:11.915 --> 23:16.440
Yes. The Kumbha is it here.

23:24.161 --> 23:30.569
So far, in the movement of our consciousness,

23:30.770 --> 23:40.193
we have been trying to understand the God Almighty

23:40.394 --> 23:47.256
and all other five elements that we call as important.

23:57.346 --> 24:01.605
And also,

24:01.806 --> 24:05.558
the consciousness has been moving

24:05.759 --> 24:12.175
towards the understanding of

24:12.376 --> 24:17.985
all the other four elements but the Mother Earth.

24:19.790 --> 24:23.230
That had to be such, because unless and until

24:23.431 --> 24:28.964
the understanding of all these four other elements

24:29.165 --> 24:32.495
are brought to a certain degree,

24:32.696 --> 24:35.401
the Mother Earth cannot express itself.

24:35.602 --> 24:39.956
Like if all your chakras, four chakras, are caught up,

24:40.157 --> 24:42.940
you cannot raise the Kundalini,

24:43.141 --> 24:45.932
you cannot give Self-Realization.

24:46.133 --> 24:50.346
You cannot have a mass evolutionary process done.

24:50.547 --> 24:54.955
That’s why we had yagyas,

24:55.156 --> 25:00.564
all other methods of exciting the four elements.

25:00.765 --> 25:03.587
They worshipped the water

25:03.788 --> 25:10.616
and they worshipped air, the sky, the firmament, the light.

25:13.321 --> 25:16.639
And that’s how they came up to the time of Christ

25:16.840 --> 25:22.050
where light was worshipped.

25:24.067 --> 25:29.702
But today when we are in this modern Sahaja Yoga,

25:29.903 --> 25:33.015
we are actually at the level of the Mother Earth,

25:33.216 --> 25:35.804
because this is the age of the Aquarius.

25:36.005 --> 25:40.671
And Aquarius is the same as the Kumbha—

25:40.872 --> 25:43.546
is the Mother Earth.

25:43.747 --> 25:48.715
So we are at the level of the Mother Earth.

25:49.880 --> 25:55.007
You can also see in the consciousness of human beings;

25:55.208 --> 25:59.226
I’m saying not only men, but women also and men.

25:59.427 --> 26:02.656
The consciousness is moving more towards

26:02.857 --> 26:08.258
the feminine expression of life.

26:08.459 --> 26:10.906
But as stupid as human beings are,

26:11.107 --> 26:15.164
the feminists also have been very stupid,

26:15.365 --> 26:20.097
that they are fighting on the level of rationality,

26:20.298 --> 26:24.933
of economics, of politics—all useless things.

26:25.134 --> 26:28.050
Equality on all these things if they are to be sought,

26:28.251 --> 26:32.308
you become men, you just become like men.

26:32.509 --> 26:35.115
If you are argumentative, if you are rational,

26:35.316 --> 26:39.435
if you talk like man, it’s a masculine development.

26:39.636 --> 26:42.756
But the Mothers development, the feminine development,

26:42.957 --> 26:48.045
is not equality in the way the men have been stupid.

26:48.246 --> 26:50.967
No use competing with men in their stupidity,

26:51.168 --> 26:53.934
the amount of stupidity has been created already for us

26:54.135 --> 26:56.536
quite sufficiently.

26:56.737 --> 27:00.427
The whole world is today, is expressing that nonsense

27:00.628 --> 27:05.560
that they have—the competition, the aggression, the oppression.

27:05.761 --> 27:08.958
So the other side of the woman, which was called as the

27:09.159 --> 27:14.488
dominated one, the dark side, the oppressed and all that

27:14.689 --> 27:17.118
has to express itself in a different way.

27:17.319 --> 27:21.462
The whole mode, the style, has to change.

27:21.663 --> 27:24.329
See now, in Christianity one should understand;

27:24.530 --> 27:27.352
why Christianity, even Judaism, any religion,

27:27.553 --> 27:30.844
even Hinduism and all that

27:31.045 --> 27:33.795
but its more in Christianity, surprisingly

27:33.996 --> 27:40.170
they just had no place for Mary.

27:40.371 --> 27:46.311
And Muslims even crowned it by completely canceling Fatima.

27:46.512 --> 27:52.209
And on top of that,

27:52.410 --> 27:56.693
you will see that among Christians, I think that ordination,

27:56.894 --> 28:00.476
or what you call that, is not given to the . . . to women,

28:00.677 --> 28:05.755
while Christ was not born of a man.

28:07.505 --> 28:10.921
But that does not in any way mean that you compete men

28:11.122 --> 28:16.486
in their foolish enterprises by which they have practically

28:16.687 --> 28:20.291
brought this world to such a ruinous state.

28:20.492 --> 28:26.518
So today we have to understand that it is the time for

28:26.719 --> 28:30.374
the motherly qualities to develop. Even a man,

28:30.575 --> 28:33.968
when he becomes motherly only, becomes a great man.

28:34.169 --> 28:41.054
Like Christ, when he had compassion, he was called as a saint.

28:41.255 --> 28:45.702
So the quality of a woman as a Mother—

28:45.903 --> 28:49.288
Goddess is always as a Mother—

28:49.489 --> 28:53.602
and She is the power most important to ignite Sahaja Yoga.

28:53.803 --> 28:56.696
Now how She ignites, I’ll tell you.

28:56.897 --> 29:00.305
I’ll give an analogy, but analogy should not be carried too far—

29:00.506 --> 29:04.907
as wise Sahaja Yogis you should not carry it too far.

29:05.108 --> 29:08.251
Say there is a zero, it has no meaning.

29:08.452 --> 29:11.978
In the same way God Almighty has no meaning,

29:12.179 --> 29:16.978
till you put some sort of one or two before it.

29:17.179 --> 29:20.025
It’s a zero. It has an existence

29:20.226 --> 29:24.525
but it has no capacity or a power to express itself.

29:24.726 --> 29:26.119
So it’s a zero.

29:26.320 --> 29:30.807
Like that we should say the masculine growth is a zero.

29:31.008 --> 29:33.557
Another analogy I will give you to understand it.

29:33.758 --> 29:38.995
That if you see

29:39.196 --> 29:45.198
very high power wires, going over your head,

29:45.399 --> 29:48.998
they are absolutely harmless, there’s no trouble.

29:49.199 --> 29:53.059
In Delhi there was a suggestion that there is a very big plot of

29:53.260 --> 29:58.349
available where there are high power wires are going

29:58.550 --> 30:02.693
and we can have it for free. I asked "What is the problem?"

30:02.894 --> 30:06.411
They said only, if earth gets connected with that

30:06.612 --> 30:10.036
then you will have problem.

30:10.237 --> 30:13.626
So till these-this high power thing, whatever it is—

30:13.827 --> 30:18.306
is not connected with the earth, it has no meaning at all.

30:18.507 --> 30:23.799
But earth is very different from this dynamic power

30:24.000 --> 30:29.549
that is flowing through those wires, which are zero,

30:29.750 --> 30:33.031
which mean nothing.

30:33.898 --> 30:37.095
In the same way, in a woman,

30:37.296 --> 30:42.811
the womb of a woman is the Kundalini.

30:43.257 --> 30:46.869
Now what is a womb? Now, if that is the Kundalini,

30:47.070 --> 30:49.494
that expresses the Kundalini in the gross;

30:49.695 --> 30:53.908
that means the Mother Earth is also like the womb.

30:54.109 --> 30:57.416
Now what does a womb do?

30:57.617 --> 31:02.236
It receives the sperm,

31:02.437 --> 31:06.454
which is just a frivolous act of man

31:06.655 --> 31:09.938
or you can say just an aggression,

31:10.139 --> 31:13.907
and she then nourishes -

31:14.108 --> 31:18.446
looks after it, corrects it

31:18.647 --> 31:22.993
and allows it to grow, not in an aggressive way

31:23.194 --> 31:27.446
but in a very compassionate and a sensible way,

31:27.647 --> 31:33.865
till it is expelled out of the womb when it is grown up.

31:35.147 --> 31:39.446
So the idea of womb is that the expression has to be

31:39.647 --> 31:44.884
in such a manner that it does not dominate.

31:45.085 --> 31:49.056
It does not dominate the embryo.

31:49.257 --> 31:51.697
If it dominates, how can it grow?

31:51.898 --> 31:55.705
So it nourishes it and makes it grow.

31:55.906 --> 31:58.400
This is what today’s Sahaja Yoga is.

31:58.601 --> 32:01.681
That now the Mother Earth is the one,

32:01.882 --> 32:07.072
who is symbolized within you as the Mooladhara,

32:07.273 --> 32:10.986
as symbolized as the AdiShakti here-

32:11.187 --> 32:14.791
is sitting down before you to nourish you,

32:14.992 --> 32:17.963
to make you grow into new personalities—

32:18.164 --> 32:21.796
into mature personalities.

32:23.117 --> 32:27.218
This concept we must understand.

32:27.812 --> 32:30.580
So the women of the West must understand

32:30.781 --> 32:33.324
that the nonsensical ideas they have taken from men

32:33.525 --> 32:38.769
must be completely discarded. They have to become women first.

32:38.970 --> 32:42.558
Those women who just are talking like men,

32:42.759 --> 32:46.535
can never help in Sahaja Yoga.

32:46.736 --> 32:51.957
They have to be like this Mother Earth who allows you

32:52.158 --> 32:54.410
to do what you like with Her.

32:54.611 --> 32:57.247
I mean you human beings have been so stupid

32:57.448 --> 33:00.177
to exploit Her to the maximum,

33:00.378 --> 33:05.769
not onlyt hat but also She

33:05.970 --> 33:08.926
bears lot of nonsense upon Herself.

33:09.127 --> 33:13.606
But then a time reaches where She becomes explosive,

33:13.807 --> 33:18.864
then She starts consuming people inside Herself.

33:19.065 --> 33:22.044
And when She is consuming people

33:22.245 --> 33:26.302
then you see the earthquakes and droughts and this and that,

33:26.503 --> 33:31.357
all these things start coming in and people get engulfed

33:31.558 --> 33:36.232
into these problems

33:36.433 --> 33:41.018
which they blame Mother Earth for that.

33:47.303 --> 33:50.235
The problems that human beings have created

33:50.436 --> 33:55.243
out of aggressive nature—even aggression towards the Mother Earth,

33:55.444 --> 34:00.071
they have to pay dividend for that. And they are paying.

34:00.272 --> 34:04.266
Now, to stop this kind of a movement of aggressiveness

34:04.467 --> 34:07.110
which brings all kinds of disturbances,

34:07.311 --> 34:11.243
one has to recede back and should develop

34:11.444 --> 34:16.157
the sense of totality, of compassion.

34:16.358 --> 34:20.759
Unless and until, you understand totality,

34:20.960 --> 34:23.087
the total, the complete, the whole—

34:23.288 --> 34:28.415
that’s the womb that’s your Mother.

34:28.616 --> 34:31.610
As long as you try to be individualistic

34:31.811 --> 34:36.305
you cannot be a good Sahaja Yogi.

34:36.506 --> 34:40.813
You have to become one with the whole.

34:41.014 --> 34:44.559
Now we have to face ourselves for that, very important it is.

34:44.760 --> 34:48.239
Specially in the west, I would say we have to face ourselves

34:48.440 --> 34:51.427
very clearly—what are we up to?

34:51.628 --> 34:55.557
That’s a very important thing.

34:57.620 --> 35:02.557
First of all let us see where is our attention.

35:03.245 --> 35:08.505
Ask a question. We are Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yogis

35:08.706 --> 35:13.169
within our fold

35:13.370 --> 35:18.427
and I am sometimes surprised that even now,

35:18.628 --> 35:22.815
the attention can be very funny.

35:24.675 --> 35:27.935
Like, simple thing, like we can have attention

35:28.136 --> 35:31.792
on material things:

35:33.152 --> 35:38.287
"this is mine-this is yours;

35:38.488 --> 35:41.529
that I should have my privacy." Then you are gone into

35:41.730 --> 35:45.435
the another realm of aggressiveness.

35:45.636 --> 35:47.755
If you try to have your own privacy,

35:47.956 --> 35:55.463
then you are depriving others of their privacy.

35:56.002 --> 35:59.374
It was all right when you were not Sahaja Yogis,

35:59.575 --> 36:01.921
to have your privacy, because you had to grow

36:02.122 --> 36:06.452
in your privacy at that time. But after Sahaja Yoga

36:06.653 --> 36:13.593
you have to become one with everyone else—

36:13.794 --> 36:16.929
that is very important. Before Sahaja Yoga

36:17.130 --> 36:22.812
you were different and after Sahaja Yoga you are different.

36:23.013 --> 36:27.953
The whole concept must change after Sahaja Yoga.

36:28.154 --> 36:31.086
That now you have become one with the whole

36:31.287 --> 36:34.391
and to feel that you are one with the whole,

36:34.592 --> 36:39.805
you should try to give up all your individualistic attitudes.

36:40.006 --> 36:47.024
That’s very common now to hear "Yes, I like this, I like that."

36:48.552 --> 36:52.157
It’s very common: "I like it." Very common.

36:52.358 --> 36:57.654
But doesn’t behove a Sahaja Yogi to say such a thing.

36:58.725 --> 37:03.766
You see, how can I say that I like some thing?

37:03.967 --> 37:09.282
Think of a mother who has to bear the child,

37:09.483 --> 37:14.516
has to give birth to a child, has to look after the child,

37:14.717 --> 37:18.891
the needs of the child, protect the child,

37:19.092 --> 37:21.297
train the child. How can she say:

37:21.498 --> 37:25.802
"I like this" and "I like that"! Where is the time?

37:26.272 --> 37:29.391
To think what you like and what you don’t like,

37:29.592 --> 37:34.938
"I like this food, I like that food". Where is the time?

37:35.139 --> 37:38.438
Where is the energy left for that? Where is the attention?

37:38.639 --> 37:45.157
The attention is on the upbringing of the child.

37:45.358 --> 37:50.938
Now in the same way a Sahaja Yogi must know that

37:51.139 --> 37:56.211
the child within him is born—

37:56.412 --> 37:58.774
the Spirit.

37:58.975 --> 38:02.602
Spirit is the child

38:02.803 --> 38:05.422
which has been born within him,

38:05.623 --> 38:10.578
now he has to nourish, through the Kundalini.

38:10.779 --> 38:14.875
He has to water it, he has to look after it.

38:15.076 --> 38:18.578
It has to make it grow. Now where is the time

38:18.779 --> 38:21.867
for other nonsensical things? You have a child in hand.

38:22.068 --> 38:27.211
You are all mothers looking after your child—that’s your Spirit.

38:27.412 --> 38:31.203
So where do you have time for all these things?

38:31.404 --> 38:33.172
What attention should be:

38:33.373 --> 38:36.555
"What can I do to make this child happy,

38:36.756 --> 38:40.774
to make this child grow, to make this child

38:40.975 --> 38:43.626
completely manifest my self."

38:43.827 --> 38:47.165
The mother replaces herself

38:47.366 --> 38:51.110
as soon as the child becomes a mature child.

38:51.311 --> 38:53.665
So now in you, the Motherhood

38:53.866 --> 38:57.853
must take over than the Fatherhood.

38:58.054 --> 39:01.212
Motherhood towards yourself. The attitude should be

39:01.413 --> 39:04.048
like a Mother towards the child.

39:04.249 --> 39:06.712
How her attention is towards the child?

39:06.913 --> 39:11.751
You can see in every day-to-day life how we behave.

39:11.952 --> 39:16.478
I have seen people very much interested even now, in food.

39:16.679 --> 39:19.189
I mean, where is the time? Where is the attention?

39:19.390 --> 39:22.127
How can you be so much worried about your food?

39:22.328 --> 39:25.197
Worried about your sleep. Worried about your health;

39:25.398 --> 39:29.431
worried about this-that? I mean, here you are to worry about your child

39:29.632 --> 39:31.962
which you have got now within.

39:32.163 --> 39:35.517
And that’s why the child is neglected and sometimes you find

39:35.734 --> 39:40.749
the child becomes sick or sometimes goes into a coma

39:40.950 --> 39:44.538
or may die away also.

39:44.739 --> 39:48.749
So the situation is very different now for Sahaja Yogis:

39:48.950 --> 39:53.007
"how to treat themselves?"

39:53.208 --> 39:56.148
Those who are running after still food

39:56.349 --> 39:59.359
and all these nonsensical things. I mean have seen Sahaja Yogis,

39:59.560 --> 40:04.106
all their attention is on food all the time.

40:04.849 --> 40:07.367
How dedication can come in a person

40:07.568 --> 40:12.927
who is so much dedicated to food habits?

40:13.568 --> 40:17.859
Like, we have seen,

40:18.060 --> 40:21.468
you might have also seen—some of you—Ajanta caves were built.

40:21.669 --> 40:25.257
In ten generations they built Ajanta caves,

40:25.458 --> 40:29.663
ten generations! And

40:29.864 --> 40:34.272
they built it in a place where there was not even water available—

40:34.473 --> 40:37.280
to begin with.

40:37.481 --> 40:40.374
And day in and day out thousands of people,

40:40.575 --> 40:44.913
without getting any payment, without getting anything, built it.

40:45.114 --> 40:47.015
No food—no question!

40:47.216 --> 40:50.171
They used to eat some fruits somewhere here, there,

40:50.372 --> 40:55.114
but their dedication gave them power to do it.

40:56.552 --> 40:59.226
But this dedication can only be developed

40:59.427 --> 41:05.098
if you realize that you have to Mother your child.

41:07.637 --> 41:12.496
Now if the mother is ugly, the child will be ugly too.

41:12.697 --> 41:16.613
Because it is the mother who is expressed in the child.

41:16.814 --> 41:18.933
She doesn’t dominate the child all right,

41:19.134 --> 41:24.938
but she definitely can corrupt the image of the child.

41:26.142 --> 41:31.777
And that’s what exactly happens when we, the Sahaja Yogis,

41:31.978 --> 41:34.980
are not bothered as to look after our Spirit

41:35.181 --> 41:39.805
and our spiritual growth. Even now, you will be surprised,

41:40.006 --> 41:43.594
fifty percent people write letters to Me:

41:43.795 --> 41:46.672
"Mother I am still possessed,

41:46.873 --> 41:50.070
I have worked with lemons and chilies,

41:50.271 --> 41:53.484
I am coming to you for this and that."

41:53.685 --> 41:56.794
It is a very low-grade business. I think even after so many years

41:56.995 --> 41:59.613
if you are possessed, then I think you should beat yourself

41:59.814 --> 42:02.847
every day hundred and eight times.

42:03.048 --> 42:09.175
It’s a very low grade behavior, I personally think,

42:09.376 --> 42:12.738
that after your Mother has worked so hard with you;

42:12.939 --> 42:16.801
you are still just the same, coming back with the

42:17.002 --> 42:21.957
horrible idea of bringing

42:22.158 --> 42:27.134
all kinds of problems to your Mother.

42:28.713 --> 42:33.450
That means you have not looking after your child.

42:33.651 --> 42:36.723
Now in Sahaja Yoga it’s not a child

42:36.924 --> 42:40.098
which is an individual child you have to look after.

42:40.299 --> 42:45.036
This is, one should understand. This is where we miss very much,

42:45.237 --> 42:48.239
especially by the intellectuals.

42:48.440 --> 42:52.411
They think it is their own child which should be all right,

42:52.612 --> 42:56.070
doesn’t matter about others’ children. Or, doesn’t matter

42:56.271 --> 43:00.812
if you have connection with others or not. It’s very common.

43:01.013 --> 43:02.803
Because, in the rationality gives them that sense,

43:03.004 --> 43:05.858
"Oh my spirits are all right, my vibrations are all right,

43:06.059 --> 43:08.691
so it is all right if I do not go to puja

43:08.892 --> 43:11.254
or if I do not go to any collective thing

43:11.455 --> 43:13.746
or if I do not support in any collective work

43:13.947 --> 43:18.355
or if I do not take any responsibility of Sahaja Yoga.

43:18.556 --> 43:22.996
Because once you become collective you take responsibilities.

43:23.197 --> 43:27.582
So you are over satisfied with yourself that is good,

43:27.783 --> 43:31.762
that I need not take up any responsibility.

43:31.963 --> 43:35.137
All the Sahaja Yogis are bad, or some of them are bad.

43:35.338 --> 43:40.614
I have nothing to do with them and this is that and that and that.

43:40.815 --> 43:46.994
But in Sahaja Yoga as it is, the Motherhood is universal.

43:48.065 --> 43:56.066
Because if you are the nose, say then somebody is the eye;

43:56.267 --> 44:02.399
if you are the ears, somebody is the lips.

44:03.080 --> 44:07.981
So, it is essential for you to understand

44:08.182 --> 44:14.723
that anybody who is a Sahaja Yogi is in trouble,

44:14.924 --> 44:19.067
you are in trouble. Is threat to your growth;

44:19.268 --> 44:22.020
it is a threat to your growth, because it is the Whole that is growing.

44:22.221 --> 44:24.872
Of course, those who are absolutely useless

44:25.073 --> 44:29.802
will be thrown away, gradually. That’s what Mother does.

44:30.003 --> 44:35.779
They can be thrown away absolutely,

44:35.980 --> 44:38.849
so much far away that they will never return.

44:39.050 --> 44:41.677
But you don’t have to worry about such people,

44:41.878 --> 44:45.763
they will be thrown away. They will be given some chances,

44:45.964 --> 44:51.622
some more credits will be given, some graces will be given,

44:51.823 --> 44:54.552
but ultimately they will be thrown away. So you don’t have to worry.

44:54.753 --> 44:57.161
But you must worry about the Whole.

44:57.362 --> 45:01.333
And you have to take up the responsibility.

45:01.534 --> 45:05.731
Those who do not take up the responsibility

45:05.932 --> 45:11.317
are not the people who are yet matured their child—

45:11.518 --> 45:14.137
that’s the Spirit.

45:14.338 --> 45:17.473
Every type of responsibility that you can take,

45:17.674 --> 45:20.957
think of what responsibilities you can take.

45:21.158 --> 45:23.918
That is why most of us have bad Vishuddhis,

45:24.119 --> 45:26.824
because we do not take the responsibilities,

45:27.025 --> 45:29.871
and whatever responsibility we do take

45:30.072 --> 45:34.355
we have to be much, much, much more responsible

45:34.556 --> 45:39.985
than ordinary government servants are.

45:42.270 --> 45:46.538
Sometimes we hear from one ear and throw it away from the same—

45:46.739 --> 45:50.856
don’t even allow it to come into the head.

45:54.153 --> 46:00.866
So, one has to understand that the child is your responsibility,

46:01.067 --> 46:03.179
you have to look after the child.

46:03.380 --> 46:08.762
And the Whole is also your responsibility.

46:10.013 --> 46:15.914
Now, how to establish the connection between your Spirit,

46:16.115 --> 46:20.797
or keep the connection on between the Spirit and the womb,

46:20.998 --> 46:24.621
or the Kundalini,

46:24.822 --> 46:27.488
is the biggest problem that we all face:

46:27.689 --> 46:30.480
that our connections are very loose

46:30.681 --> 46:37.806
and that’s why this Kundalini cannot look after the Spirit.

46:38.142 --> 46:41.964
I wonder if you have noticed one thing in Sahaja Yoga,

46:42.165 --> 46:47.805
that you can maneuver the Kundalini, but not the Spirit.

46:49.900 --> 46:52.780
You can raise your hand, the Kundalini will move.

46:52.981 --> 46:54.936
You can maneuver it.

46:55.137 --> 46:58.702
You can give it a bandhan, it will go round and round and round.

46:58.903 --> 47:02.405
But what about the Spirit?

47:02.606 --> 47:04.928
You cannot maneuver it.

47:05.129 --> 47:07.930
There is only one mantra to awaken the Spirit,

47:08.131 --> 47:12.344
in the sense that to please him you have to say you are the Spirit.

47:12.545 --> 47:15.687
But you cannot maneuver it. You have to bring in Kundalini

47:15.888 --> 47:19.578
to look after it, you have to take Kundalini there,

47:19.779 --> 47:25.133
to the heart, so that this child

47:25.334 --> 47:29.133
which is the little offspring just now

47:29.334 --> 47:35.943
has to be carefully developed and matured.

47:38.383 --> 47:42.785
So on both the sides, of men or women,

47:42.986 --> 47:48.816
we have to understand, that if you are a man,

47:49.017 --> 47:54.004
and if you are dominating man, it’s all right.

47:54.205 --> 47:56.559
But if you are a woman and if you are dominating,

47:56.760 --> 47:59.747
then it’s a difficult thing for Sahaja Yoga to cure you,

47:59.948 --> 48:02.435
because you have lost your quality of being a woman.

48:02.636 --> 48:05.466
At least you have to be a woman to begin with.

48:05.667 --> 48:08.309
If you are not even a woman, then what can you do with

48:08.510 --> 48:13.447
this third persons who are neither man nor woman?

48:14.049 --> 48:17.220
Now the men, when they are dominating, they have to understand,

48:17.421 --> 48:20.892
that they have to be compassionate.

48:21.093 --> 48:25.181
They have to be kind,

48:25.382 --> 48:31.392
they have to be considerate, but never subservient,

48:31.593 --> 48:35.448
never subservient. This is one should understand,

48:35.649 --> 48:38.831
that you should not be subservient.

48:39.032 --> 48:41.964
Now the women, what they have to be;

48:42.165 --> 48:46.777
is to be great, large, receptive;

48:46.978 --> 48:49.816
receiving

48:50.017 --> 48:53.188
and nourishing all that.

48:54.673 --> 48:58.143
Now the way husbands are told sometimes in this West—

48:58.344 --> 49:01.476
I am shocked.

49:02.547 --> 49:05.846
Wife says this to Mr. X, "X you haven’t done this,

49:06.047 --> 49:08.221
X you haven’t done that. How have you put this?

49:08.422 --> 49:12.330
Do this, do that, do that." It’s not woman’s way of doing it,

49:12.531 --> 49:16.857
it’s absolutely wrong that to do it.

49:17.058 --> 49:20.446
To tell him to do something.

49:20.647 --> 49:24.235
You are becoming a manly, and then we lose completely

49:24.436 --> 49:32.778
that power of giving that nourishment of a woman’s love,

49:32.979 --> 49:35.645
which is the power of a woman,

49:35.846 --> 49:39.575
which women don’t understand. I’ll tell you a simple example;

49:39.776 --> 49:43.590
My own grand daughter. She wants to be an air hostess all the time, she wants.

49:43.791 --> 49:46.168
She says, "You must have also thought of being an air hostess."

49:46.369 --> 49:48.621
I said, "Why? What is so great about air hostess?"

49:48.822 --> 49:54.290
She says, “That’s the only time you can give food to someone.”

49:55.838 --> 50:01.520
You see a natural instinct of a Mother that let me see them eat, you see.

50:01.721 --> 50:06.627
They don’t eat themselves, they want others to eat.

50:07.776 --> 50:11.513
But this is not in the conception of the western women, I tell you.

50:11.714 --> 50:13.451
They can’t understand this.

50:13.652 --> 50:16.646
"Why? I have done this, so why not he does this, this."

50:16.847 --> 50:20.373
It’s your privilege to do these things properly,

50:20.574 --> 50:21.967
in a proper way.

50:22.168 --> 50:25.115
But supposing somebody is a very good mechanic,

50:25.316 --> 50:28.373
the woman will also become a mechanic, "I’ll do the mechanical things".

50:28.574 --> 50:30.568
She is not there for doing mechanical work.

50:30.769 --> 50:36.706
She is there for the mechanics of the emotions.

50:37.792 --> 50:40.161
On the contrary she just does the other way round.

50:40.362 --> 50:42.224
Like a man comes home; she goes on ordering,

50:42.425 --> 50:45.333
"You have to put that right, why did you spoil my carpet?

50:45.534 --> 50:49.747
Why did you do this? Clean it up, get that thing, do that."

50:49.948 --> 50:55.098
All his mechanics of emotions are finished.

50:55.299 --> 50:57.954
Once his mechanics of emotions are finished,

50:58.155 --> 51:01.629
he is useless and you are useless as it is.

51:01.830 --> 51:06.798
And men also should not do their jobs. Let them do their own jobs.

51:07.385 --> 51:12.114
I think this is one of the biggest problems of the West today.

51:12.315 --> 51:18.442
That men are neither men, and women are not women.

51:18.643 --> 51:21.583
I find the quality so horrid,

51:21.784 --> 51:25.208
that I don’t know how to deal with the mixtures.

51:25.409 --> 51:29.903
You must understand this very simple thing in life

51:30.104 --> 51:33.208
that if you are a hybrid stuff,

51:33.409 --> 51:36.903
you can’t have the quality of a Sahaja Yogi.

51:37.104 --> 51:40.067
If you mix it up, it’s a very funny thing, isn’t it?

51:40.268 --> 51:43.915
So a woman must try to be a woman

51:44.116 --> 51:46.438
and a man must try to be a man.

51:46.639 --> 51:53.382
Now see, what is the situation, of a man,

51:53.583 --> 52:02.358
as a masculine effect on the development of consciousness?

52:02.559 --> 52:06.491
So, as the manliness was expressed

52:06.692 --> 52:10.434
we have developed science.

52:11.247 --> 52:14.694
We have developed all this knowledge,

52:14.895 --> 52:18.546
all these things which are outside.

52:18.747 --> 52:21.726
Now everything is ready.

52:21.927 --> 52:24.519
Now the woman has to come up.

52:24.720 --> 52:27.503
I mean, I am saying in the very abstract way; don’t think of woman,

52:27.704 --> 52:29.776
but you can say the feminine.

52:29.977 --> 52:33.854
The feminine nature has to rise now.

52:34.078 --> 52:38.197
Now everything is ready, it has to just spark.

52:39.688 --> 52:43.947
All the chakras are ready, now awaken the Kundalini.

52:44.148 --> 52:49.595
Kundalini is as important as the other chakras are.

52:49.804 --> 52:52.876
So now awaken the Kundalini. Now Kundalini’s behavior

52:53.077 --> 52:55.587
and mode of action is very different

52:55.788 --> 53:00.592
from the mode of action of the chakras.

53:03.939 --> 53:07.494
If the Kundalini becomes the chakras and the chakras become the Kundalini,

53:07.695 --> 53:12.589
how will you manage Sahaja Yoga? But we must assume

53:12.790 --> 53:16.753
our own nature in all dignity and in all pride;

53:16.954 --> 53:20.855
not to feel any way low down. Because a man sits on a horse,

53:21.056 --> 53:24.300
the woman wants to sit on a horse.

53:24.501 --> 53:27.777
What is the need for a woman to sit on a horse,

53:27.978 --> 53:30.668
I can’t understand. Here all the women are sitting on a horse.

53:30.869 --> 53:33.082
They’ll become like horses.

53:33.283 --> 53:37.871
Already I think half of your royal family looks like horses,

53:38.072 --> 53:40.816
don’t they?

53:41.017 --> 53:44.308
I think so. Their faces look like horses.

53:44.509 --> 53:47.066
See, so there is no need for women to do

53:47.267 --> 53:50.659
all the things that man have already done. Say, for example,

53:50.860 --> 53:55.159
there’s one personality of masculine personality that has to come

53:55.360 --> 53:58.776
and do a certain job. Now you’ve done it.

53:58.977 --> 54:01.540
All right now the another personality has to do this job.

54:01.741 --> 54:05.681
Now see the situation of the Divine also.

54:05.882 --> 54:08.498
Now the whole complication comes in that

54:08.699 --> 54:11.592
once a kind of a thing has been done,

54:11.793 --> 54:15.748
the another one that comes wants to do the same.

54:15.949 --> 54:18.068
Do you follow My point?

54:18.269 --> 54:23.136
So the whole energy is completely wasted.

54:23.911 --> 54:26.292
The whole preparation has been made

54:26.493 --> 54:29.206
for this Aquarius age to come in

54:29.407 --> 54:31.874
to bring in the Kundalini upward

54:32.075 --> 54:34.276
and to make the whole work out

54:34.477 --> 54:37.096
in such way that the left and right meet

54:37.297 --> 54:43.479
and you all become ignited enlightened

54:43.680 --> 54:50.815
It was a question of our being sharing the whole job

54:51.016 --> 54:52.831
in a proper understanding

54:53.032 --> 54:55.019
Now see how Mother Earth Herself was created,

54:55.220 --> 54:57.707
it is also a very simple thing

54:57.908 --> 55:06.159
First, the movement of the energy started flowing.

55:06.360 --> 55:09.425
Now this is a combined energy all right?

55:09.626 --> 55:14.034
Then the combined energy went round and round and round like that.

55:14.235 --> 55:19.018
And when it consolidated there was a-this big bang.

55:19.219 --> 55:22.635
When big bang took place—now this is the manly work,

55:22.836 --> 55:25.182
I should say in a way; manly style,

55:25.383 --> 55:28.745
because still the Mother earth is not produced—

55:28.946 --> 55:34.206
so then these little fragments again went round and round.

55:34.407 --> 55:36.503
With the momentum, they became roundish.

55:36.704 --> 55:39.847
Out of them the Mother Earth was selected for one job.

55:40.048 --> 55:42.644
Not to do anything - you keep quiet now.

55:42.845 --> 55:50.620
Alright. On the Mother Earth out of the water came the life—

55:50.821 --> 55:53.558
the carbon came in.

55:53.759 --> 55:57.878
Everybody helped there and a human being was created.

55:58.079 --> 56:01.155
Then the men went round, to improve their societies

56:01.356 --> 56:03.811
and whatever they have done to it, whatever was possible

56:04.012 --> 56:06.700
with their ego is done, finished now.

56:06.901 --> 56:12.185
Now they have done their job, you see. Now they are on dole,

56:12.386 --> 56:14.638
you can say.

56:14.839 --> 56:19.685
Now the womb, or we can say the Kundalini

56:19.886 --> 56:22.521
which has been waiting all these years, was resting,

56:22.722 --> 56:25.154
waiting for that time, isn’t it? So we call it:

56:25.355 --> 56:27.506
"the blossom time has now come".

56:27.707 --> 56:33.678
At that time the Kundalini has to rise and ignite,

56:33.879 --> 56:38.231
in such a way that the completion of the whole work takes place—

56:38.432 --> 56:42.486
it is simple. Do you understand now?

56:43.120 --> 56:47.521
So there’s no competition between men or women,

56:47.722 --> 56:51.513
but the style of work is different.

56:51.714 --> 56:56.005
If you understand that, then only this kind of revolution

56:56.206 --> 56:58.505
will take place and not turn out a rebellion.

56:58.706 --> 57:01.739
Actually women are rebelling against men, and a nonsense it is.

57:01.940 --> 57:05.356
It is such a headache, that you create something,

57:05.557 --> 57:08.198
allow them to grow, and the another party comes

57:08.399 --> 57:12.479
which has to complete the job starts rebelling.

57:12.680 --> 57:16.640
So the revolution has to take place and this revolution is only possible

57:16.841 --> 57:23.528
when we understand that what part is left out now to be done.

57:25.853 --> 57:28.941
Are you getting Me all right?

57:29.142 --> 57:33.089
So that part is now Realization,

57:33.290 --> 57:36.612
our awakening of the Kundalini.

57:36.813 --> 57:42.081
For that your feminine qualities are going to help you,

57:42.282 --> 57:44.635
not your masculine qualities.

57:44.836 --> 57:48.315
So aggressiveness must be given up by men.

57:48.516 --> 57:50.768
Also, because they are Sahaja Yogis now,

57:50.969 --> 57:53.940
they have to take feminine qualities. Not of fighting.

57:54.141 --> 57:56.831
If women fight they are not women.

57:57.032 --> 58:00.136
You see, women are told that

58:00.337 --> 58:06.988
"you are useless, you are good for nothing",

58:07.189 --> 58:11.636
so now they are trying to show, ‘no’, we are also all right.

58:11.837 --> 58:16.743
If you have eaten one crow we will eat three."

58:18.703 --> 58:30.047
Now, this understanding and the wise perception would be such that

58:30.248 --> 58:33.274
"what do we have to do now to change the mode

58:33.475 --> 58:35.805
and the style of our lives?"

58:36.006 --> 58:38.508
What’s wrong here?

58:38.709 --> 58:40.899
A turning point has come.

58:41.100 --> 58:48.055
Now the evolution is not rebellion, at all by any chance.

58:48.256 --> 58:51.852
It’s a wrong idea people have. It’s not rebellion,

58:52.053 --> 58:54.385
that you hit me and I hit you—go on hitting each other,

58:54.586 --> 58:57.268
like a pendulum you move; you see the movement of a pendulum.

58:57.469 --> 59:01.041
It’s not like a boom, this thing—that today you are born as a Muslim,

59:01.242 --> 59:03.782
tomorrow you are born as a Jew, then you are born as a Jew,

59:03.983 --> 59:06.157
then you are born as a Hindu, then you are born as—

59:06.358 --> 59:10.470
it’s not pendulum. It is spiral movement.

59:10.671 --> 59:15.329
So every time you achieve an evolution

59:15.530 --> 59:17.517
you are at a higher level than before.

59:17.718 --> 59:21.595
So the movement is spiral—see My point?

59:21.796 --> 59:28.876
Now to achieve the higher position in our whole being

59:29.077 --> 59:31.032
what should we do?

59:31.233 --> 59:34.923
Is to understand that from this point to that point we have to rise—

59:35.124 --> 59:43.000
we have to rise in a way that we move in such a way

59:43.201 --> 59:51.408
that it is not in a pendulum way but in a spiral way.

59:51.792 --> 59:58.771
And to move spirally, you have to use another kind of force.

59:58.972 --> 01:00:03.591
Whatever you have used so far has to be endowed

01:00:03.792 --> 01:00:05.586
with another kind of force

01:00:05.787 --> 01:00:08.594
and that’s the feminine qualities of women.

01:00:08.795 --> 01:00:12.180
But where are the feminine women?

01:00:12.381 --> 01:00:16.336
They dress up like women, they will try to be feminine

01:00:16.537 --> 01:00:20.805
and all that. That’s not the way. From inside, from the heart.

01:00:21.006 --> 01:00:26.672
A feminine heart. Christ showed that in His life—

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:30.258
He forgave. Only a woman can forgive, man cannot,

01:00:30.459 --> 01:00:34.149
because he is aggressive. How can he forgive?

01:00:34.350 --> 01:00:38.172
Krishna never forgave anyone. He used to kill.

01:00:38.373 --> 01:00:45.826
Right royal fashion, go, all right? if you are so, all right. Done.

01:00:46.283 --> 01:00:49.293
He forgave to such an extent to show that

01:00:49.494 --> 01:00:54.176
He is now giving a turn to the spiral

01:00:54.377 --> 01:00:59.309
and now a feminine quality has to be developed among human beings.

01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:02.497
But that doesn’t mean that you start walking like women

01:01:02.698 --> 01:01:07.448
or developing waistlines.

01:01:09.948 --> 01:01:13.013
Because that’s another stupidity.

01:01:13.214 --> 01:01:16.513
But to be Motherly.

01:01:16.714 --> 01:01:20.669
Not to be fatherly, but to be Motherly.

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:24.474
That kindness, that gentleness

01:01:24.675 --> 01:01:28.544
should be in your behavior towards each other.

01:01:28.745 --> 01:01:33.060
Of course this force also corrects, sometimes also gets angry also.

01:01:33.261 --> 01:01:35.826
Mother also has to get angry sometimes,

01:01:36.027 --> 01:01:39.584
specially with people who never get all right with their behavior,

01:01:39.785 --> 01:01:42.123
She has to be shouting, punishing,

01:01:42.324 --> 01:01:46.607
and sometimes She also destroys; it’s all right.

01:01:46.808 --> 01:01:51.683
But that is sometimes, not all the time.

01:01:52.636 --> 01:01:58.052
So just now one has to accept that to be like the Mother Earth

01:01:58.253 --> 01:02:01.568
we have to be forbearing—Dhara.

01:02:01.769 --> 01:02:06.795
Daharaitey sadara. She is the sustenance of everything.

01:02:06.996 --> 01:02:11.951
She takes everything, the vibrations are sucked in; see, talk about it.

01:02:12.152 --> 01:02:14.717
And now for the first time after Realization,

01:02:14.918 --> 01:02:19.537
you can give Her back what you have got it, from Her.

01:02:19.738 --> 01:02:21.981
You can give vibrations to Her trees that are created, y

01:02:22.182 --> 01:02:26.994
ou can make them beautiful. You can transform a flower

01:02:27.222 --> 01:02:30.287
into a more beautiful flower.

01:02:30.488 --> 01:02:32.873
Now whatever you have got from the Mother Earth

01:02:33.074 --> 01:02:38.053
you can give because your Mother Earth is awakened within you now.

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:39.254
So you return Her back everything that you got from Her

01:02:41.547 --> 01:02:46.112
and give it to others. Generosity, the greatness of heart,

01:02:46.313 --> 01:02:53.292
nobility, forgiveness, love, affection, bearing everything for love.

01:02:53.493 --> 01:02:57.753
And for the mother, to save her child, she’ll starve herself,

01:02:57.954 --> 01:03:01.589
she’ll do everything to save her child,

01:03:01.790 --> 01:03:05.573
complete dedication she has for her child.

01:03:05.774 --> 01:03:09.160
That’s a real mother—I mean the kind of mothers you see these days,

01:03:09.361 --> 01:03:12.104
neither they are mothers nor women. But what I am saying,

01:03:12.305 --> 01:03:18.336
that’s the real image of a mother, and you have a image before you.

01:03:20.416 --> 01:03:23.673
So, this is what one has to develop now,

01:03:23.874 --> 01:03:26.657
whether you are men or women as Sahaja Yogis

01:03:26.858 --> 01:03:30.837
you must develop a new consciousness of affection,

01:03:31.038 --> 01:03:33.962
love and compassion.

01:03:34.163 --> 01:03:38.767
Getting angry, getting into a temper, shouting at people,

01:03:38.968 --> 01:03:43.423
screaming at people—is not going to help you much.

01:03:43.624 --> 01:03:46.212
If you have to help the whole, the growth of the whole,

01:03:46.413 --> 01:03:50.720
try to make yourself a milder person—

01:03:50.921 --> 01:03:53.993
be angry with yourself that you are losing tempers

01:03:54.194 --> 01:03:58.673
and you are so unkind to others.

01:03:58.874 --> 01:04:03.564
All the problems have come out of the over-growth of the masculinity—

01:04:03.765 --> 01:04:06.127
over-growth. It reaches a certain point, you see,

01:04:06.328 --> 01:04:11.632
it’s reached such a wretched point now, that it has to come down.

01:04:14.906 --> 01:04:19.332
But also femininity, at a lower level, without Realization

01:04:19.533 --> 01:04:24.105
could be very, very small hearted, chicken hearted,

01:04:24.306 --> 01:04:28.931
could be all the time worried about her own child.

01:04:29.329 --> 01:04:32.886
That’s what one has to change—

01:04:33.087 --> 01:04:37.949
is to have love and affection for every Sahaja Yogi,

01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:41.624
for every person. When it comes to fighting others

01:04:41.825 --> 01:04:46.226
you are all one but among yourselves you can look after each other,

01:04:46.427 --> 01:04:49.820
tell them—say for example, something is paining in my nose here,

01:04:50.021 --> 01:04:52.578
I will just try to rub it in the same way.

01:04:52.779 --> 01:04:57.984
But I won’t try to cut my nose will I? Or bang my nose, I won’t?

01:04:58.185 --> 01:05:03.129
So the feeling that the other is myself; be kind and gentle—

01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:06.660
try to improve and help in that manner.

01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:09.426
I hope you have understood the whole thing.

01:05:09.627 --> 01:05:13.315
In a nutshell is that: we have to change the whole mode—

01:05:13.516 --> 01:05:18.417
a radical change has to come in the society of Sahaja Yogis.

01:05:18.618 --> 01:05:23.899
Now, if there is any question you ask Me, before we start the puja.

01:05:26.118 --> 01:05:31.109
Now the problem of divorce and all that, you can see this.

01:05:42.217 --> 01:05:47.474
Left Nabhi problema, we can talk to.

01:06:14.973 --> 01:06:18.274
What is it?

01:06:23.568 --> 01:06:25.888
See.

01:06:27.466 --> 01:06:32.578
This problem comes in where you are not the whole.

01:06:32.779 --> 01:06:34.578
All right?

01:06:34.779 --> 01:06:38.726
Now supposing, as I told you, if you are the whole,

01:06:38.927 --> 01:06:42.677
then who is the other?

01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.952
Then you will, even if you have to hurt. Say, for example,

01:06:47.153 --> 01:06:51.140
if there is blood coming out of my thumb,

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:55.546
I press it hard to stop the blood. It will hurt the thumb, thing.

01:06:55.747 --> 01:06:58.748
But the discrimination must be used, that I'm loosing my blood

01:06:58.949 --> 01:07:01.247
which is precious, much more precious than this finger

01:07:01.448 --> 01:07:04.666
it will hurt.

01:07:06.190 --> 01:07:08.223
But that discretion must be achieved, you see.

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:10.317
In Sahaja Yoga, you're all free to develop

01:07:10.518 --> 01:07:12.489
your sense of discretion.

01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:14.578
And once you develop your sense of discretion,

01:07:14.779 --> 01:07:17.133
gradually you will know what to do. In the beginning you will hurt,

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:19.774
no doubt, because you are used to that.

01:07:19.975 --> 01:07:22.391
I've seen people here, just barking at each other,

01:07:22.592 --> 01:07:25.586
as soon as they see each other they start barking.

01:07:25.787 --> 01:07:27.977
You go anywhere in the whole country you go anywhere,

01:07:28.178 --> 01:07:30.196
they start barking for nothing at all. I was surprised.

01:07:30.397 --> 01:07:31.618
In a school, I went there,

01:07:31.819 --> 01:07:34.063
there also everybody is barking at each other, you know.

01:07:34.264 --> 01:07:36.868
Whether they are drunk or not drunk, makes no difference-

01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:41.711
is the same state. But after Realization, you do say.

01:07:41.912 --> 01:07:46.555
Because you feel concerned, you're worried.

01:07:46.756 --> 01:07:51.594
But you say in such a way that you achieve the result.

01:07:51.795 --> 01:07:54.633
See My point is-that is the criteria:

01:07:54.834 --> 01:07:58.693
that you should achieve the results.

01:07:59.537 --> 01:08:01.938
But, supposing a man has come for the first time, and tell him

01:08:02.139 --> 01:08:04.672
that "you are a bhoot",

01:08:04.873 --> 01:08:09.000
then naturally he will be hurt;

01:08:09.201 --> 01:08:12.701
very common.

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:18.016
First day, somebody walks in and you say "you are a bhoot".

01:08:18.217 --> 01:08:20.050
I mean, thank God if he doesn't understand the meaning

01:08:20.251 --> 01:08:24.586
of the word bhoot -then it's all right.

01:08:28.554 --> 01:08:33.681
But first you think of being gentle, nice,

01:08:33.882 --> 01:08:38.939
embalming, sweet. Let's see, find out ways and methods;

01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:42.041
there's a very good way-in the evening, to write down

01:08:42.242 --> 01:08:46.609
"how many sweet things I've said today."

01:08:51.687 --> 01:08:53.994
Not like this, sweet things we say,

01:08:54.195 --> 01:08:57.314
"You're looking beautiful" all that.

01:08:57.515 --> 01:09:02.546
Not the superficial ones. That may pamper the ego.

01:09:02.882 --> 01:09:05.853
But they're so sweet you know, things are.

01:09:06.054 --> 01:09:12.400
Let's say

01:09:12.601 --> 01:09:15.220
there are some very good words,

01:09:15.421 --> 01:09:19.772
you can say, like-"Are you warm enough?"

01:09:20.476 --> 01:09:24.470
-very sweet way of asking a question. Then, it's very simple;

01:09:24.671 --> 01:09:26.430
but you can say like that.

01:09:26.631 --> 01:09:30.125
Just-it's very difficult for people to say that even, I've seen.

01:09:30.326 --> 01:09:33.672
Looking after others comforts. Somebody is sitting, he wants water.

01:09:33.873 --> 01:09:37.616
Awkwardly sitting. You just go rush and given him water.

01:09:37.817 --> 01:09:43.476
Oh that's too much to expect. That, Oh God you gave water,

01:09:43.677 --> 01:09:47.679
"I'm not his servant"-immediately the question comes into the head.

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:51.843
Little bit trying to do something here and there.

01:09:52.044 --> 01:09:56.726
Or sometimes thinking-going in the market,

01:09:56.927 --> 01:10:00.460
you find something. "Oh let me take it for him".

01:10:00.661 --> 01:10:02.793
Children do. I've seen children all the time;

01:10:02.994 --> 01:10:09.869
they think of their friends-what they can buy for others.

01:10:12.061 --> 01:10:14.110
"This is good for my friend, this is good for..."

01:10:14.311 --> 01:10:15.946
She's very fond of things, she "likes. . ."

01:10:16.147 --> 01:10:18.493
All these little-little things, you know.

01:10:18.694 --> 01:10:20.626
Sometimes even a small thing

01:10:20.827 --> 01:10:22.228
like; early in the morning you get up,

01:10:22.429 --> 01:10:24.963
you find the another person is sleeping on one side,

01:10:25.164 --> 01:10:29.791
his blanket on the third side and his pillow in the fourth side.

01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:31.750
So you just put his head on the pillow

01:10:31.951 --> 01:10:36.242
and cover him with the blanket. That's mother's job.

01:10:39.585 --> 01:10:44.538
Not out of fear, but out of sheer love.

01:10:46.512 --> 01:10:49.303
Like even if it is cold and buttons are open,

01:10:49.504 --> 01:10:53.717
you can button up a person you like. Little-little things you know.

01:10:53.918 --> 01:10:56.530
Women have very little-sweet things which they do,

01:10:56.731 --> 01:11:02.645
which makes men very happy. But women have lost now, that sense.

01:11:07.125 --> 01:11:09.289
Not the fighting, but thinking of

01:11:09.490 --> 01:11:11.797
what sweet things you can do for him.

01:11:11.998 --> 01:11:16.130
And also, sometimes teasing is all right.

01:11:17.732 --> 01:11:21.101
Sometimes tickling is all right.

01:11:21.302 --> 01:11:27.593
But a kind of a sweet you see rapport between each other;

01:11:27.794 --> 01:11:33.567
even the feeling, that we can do that. It's a master's job.

01:11:34.271 --> 01:11:37.229
Is a master's job. The one who is a master can do it,

01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:39.576
those who are not, will not be able to.

01:11:39.777 --> 01:11:42.459
They'll again come back to hurt. Ultimately, they'll land up

01:11:42.660 --> 01:11:46.225
with hurting or biting or coming to blows.

01:11:46.426 --> 01:11:49.374
But those who are masters will be so beautifully doing

01:11:49.575 --> 01:11:55.444
the whole job that you see a kind of a very sweet relationship-

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:57.297
it's called Madhurya. Without any lust,

01:11:57.498 --> 01:12:02.266
without any money-business, anything. Such sweet relationships.

01:12:02.467 --> 01:12:06.771
And the joy would be bubbling.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.649
All these perversions, all these things will drop off.

01:12:10.850 --> 01:12:15.350
But a very sweet relationship-

01:12:20.428 --> 01:12:26.295
all right? Even saying that, you are feeling happy.
