1
00:01:46,417 --> 00:01:49,250
We all have today gathered here

2
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:53,166
on top of this beautiful mountain,

3
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,583
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.

4
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:03,542
It’s very significant for Sahaja yogis

5
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:09,959
to understand the great event of His resurrection,

6
00:02:11,834 --> 00:02:14,333
by which He showed

7
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,999
that the spirit does not die.

8
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:22,792
He was – He was the Omkara,

9
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:27,542
He was the Logos and He was the Spirit,

10
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:33,709
and that is why He could walk on the water.

11
00:02:34,834 --> 00:02:39,583
And also now we have made a film

12
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:45,166
where we have shown how the Mooladhara,

13
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:48,709
which shows the carbon atom,

14
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,999
as clearly if you see from right to the left,

15
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:56,959
you find a proper swastika there;

16
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,709
and left to the right we see Omkara.

17
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:05,709
But when you see from down below upward,

18
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:09,709
what you see is alpha and omega.

19
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:14,583
That proves beyond doubt that Christ, as He said,

20
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:18,250
“I am the Alpha and I am the Omega,”

21
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:25,125
shows clearly that He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

22
00:03:26,166 --> 00:03:29,500
It’s a scientific proof we have now with us,

23
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:35,500
and that’s how we can tell people that it’s a fact.

24
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,458
I don’t know at the time of Christ

25
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:44,625
this alpha and omega was known to the mathematicians,

26
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:47,250
but definitely to Him

27
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:52,375
when He said, “I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

28
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:05,417
His was an incarnation very remarkable,

29
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,125
and very important for our ascent.

30
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:16,041
If He had not resurrected Himself,

31
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:20,583
we could not have achieved our ascent at all.

32
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,000
So it’s a great contribution.

33
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,250
The resurrection of Christ is evident now in your own life:

34
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:33,208
what you were before

35
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:36,792
and what you are today.

36
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,709
It is such a change,

37
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,250
such a difference,

38
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:48,500
such a transformation.

39
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,959
It is His own sacrifice

40
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:54,875
on the cross

41
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:58,875
and His own

42
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,917
beautiful resurrection

43
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,417
has created a way for all of us

44
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:10,999
to get into this new transformed state.

45
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:21,625
In this state is a different story for human beings,

46
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:24,458
and a different for Christ.

47
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,875
Christ was Himself

48
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:31,375
was holiness, was purity.

49
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:35,333
So His resurrection

50
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:42,083
is nothing but just a physical happening, we can say,

51
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:47,583
because He did not need transformation,

52
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,166
He did not

53
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:55,959
have to go through any cleansing.

54
00:05:57,417 --> 00:06:00,750
But what happened in His case

55
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:06,542
was that He became

56
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:11,208
resurrected from death

57
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:16,250
– symbolizes the life of human beings without spirituality

58
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,208
is like a death;

59
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,583
because they do everything

60
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:27,542
without any understanding about the totality,

61
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,917
about the reality,

62
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:34,291
about the absolute truth.

63
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,875
Whatever they do ultimately

64
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:41,375
takes them to their destruction.

65
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:46,375
Even the religions which are established

66
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,834
by these great incarnations

67
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:53,625
are absolutely on a decline.

68
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You do not find any trace of religious life

69
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,917
with all those people

70
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,125
who claim that they are the ones

71
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:07,250
who can represent those incarnations.

72
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:11,000
If you see in a subtle way

73
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,333
it’s very painful also,

74
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:17,834
that in the name of all these great incarnations

75
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,750
the kind of work people are doing,

76
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:25,709
the activities that they take to is something impossible,

77
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:28,999
because they have no fear of God.

78
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:32,500
In the name of God they’re doing all these horrible things

79
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:34,500
all over the world.

80
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:35,917
Of course here,

81
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,125
you can say Catholic Church has been exposed.

82
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,375
Everywhere people are seeing

83
00:07:40,792 --> 00:07:44,041
all these false things have been exposed.

84
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:48,291
But these false things they have used

85
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:52,750
under a garb of God,

86
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:55,959
spirituality and beauty.

87
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:59,583
That’s the best way you can hide.

88
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:05,083
All the cruelty, all the violence,

89
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,917
all the ugliness

90
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:12,250
– this is how they have worked it out.

91
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,333
And it has gone into such a state

92
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,750
that you do not find the slightest

93
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,625
even tinge of religious life among these people.

94
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:27,041
Like all the thieves of the world,

95
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,333
all the great crooks of the world

96
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,333
and all the intriguers of the world has taken over.

97
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:39,875
It’s only because what was written in all the books

98
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:44,041
and all the scriptures that you have to seek yourself,

99
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:47,000
was never done.

100
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:51,999
“You have to know yourself” was never done.

101
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,834
How many times Christ has said, “Know thyself.”

102
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,625
He also said that “You are to be born again”

103
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,917
– so immediately they take a certificate, “I am born again”

104
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:07,750
and start taking advantage of that kind of a certificate.

105
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:12,041
But they don’t think that actually

106
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:15,000
what benevolence it has given them.

107
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:17,250
At the most they might have made some money,

108
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:21,041
at the most they might have had some superficial powers;

109
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:27,417
but it has done nothing, if you see from a innate nature.

110
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:34,166
One must pity their insanity,

111
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:38,625
the way they have taken to Christ’s life

112
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:40,542
or to anybody else’s life

113
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:45,250
of such a noble and a higher value system,

114
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:51,750
and are doing all very low-graded things.

115
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:58,917
In Sahaja Yoga now you have transformed yourself.

116
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,083
I would say your kundalini has done the job.

117
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,792
But still the difference between Christ and you is this,

118
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:12,792
that you are coming from that environment,

119
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:15,999
that style of life,

120
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,625
that kind of thinking

121
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:21,208
which was all for your destruction.

122
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:25,875
Everything if you see now is for your destruction.

123
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,917
So when you’re coming out of it,

124
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,375
still these things hang over,

125
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:37,750
still you get affected by them.

126
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,959
Even when you’re rising higher and higher,

127
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,542
you find suddenly you are again pushed down

128
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,417
to some sort of a funny situation,

129
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:53,208
to some sort of a degrading things.

130
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:56,667
Of course, sometimes you are shocked at yourself;

131
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:59,917
sometimes you accept all that.

132
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,709
So for a Sahaja yogi it is very important

133
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:04,792
that after coming to realization

134
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,208
he has to be very introspective.

135
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,458
Instead of seeing the bad of others,

136
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:14,583
he should try to see what is bad in within himself.

137
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:19,333
It’s very important that you have to know

138
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,667
how far you are going towards your spirituality.

139
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:28,542
Because Christ did not need this,

140
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,875
He did not have to even introspect Himself.

141
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:39,709
He was something which was beyond any corruption,

142
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:46,875
and for Him it was just a physical transformation,

143
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,542
on the sense that from He died

144
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:53,041
and then He resurrected Himself.

145
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,750
But for us it is very different.

146
00:11:57,166 --> 00:12:00,166
We are now Sahaja yogis,

147
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:04,041
but we were ordinary human beings.

148
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,917
We had no light within us.

149
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,333
Now the light comes within us

150
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:11,999
and we see the light,

151
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,709
then what do we become?

152
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:19,583
We have to become the light itself.

153
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:21,750
Christ was the light.

154
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,667
He did not have to become.

155
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So we have to become the light.

156
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:30,208
And now you have to guard on

157
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,667
the way this light might get disturbed,

158
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,333
might be reduced, or may be completely extinguished.

159
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,458
So carrying on yourself with this light,

160
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:49,166
first thing you should know that

161
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,834
if you see the light, is not proper

162
00:12:52,166 --> 00:12:53,500
– means you are not the light.

163
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:57,333
You have to become the light.

164
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,166
When you are the light,

165
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,208
then in that light you can easily see

166
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:06,041
how your mind works,

167
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:08,625
what ideas it gives,

168
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,542
what affects your mind

169
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,208
while you’re ascending.

170
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:20,458
Is this the worry

171
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:26,250
or is this the responsibility that you have?

172
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:30,875
Or is this from the bad habits you had,

173
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,041
that there is an impediment

174
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:38,542
in your growth as a spiritual personality?

175
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,999
So you have to guard yourself all the time,

176
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:47,375
and see for yourself how you are progressing.

177
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,875
It’s a very beautiful journey

178
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,959
– very, very beautiful journey.

179
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,625
Yesterday I was very much happy to hear

180
00:13:56,999 --> 00:14:01,625
the song of the Russians who describe about the journey,

181
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:07,875
the journey of kundalini.

182
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:17,583
This is true, no doubt, that you are a realized soul.

183
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,959
Basically you were not a realized soul,

184
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:27,208
but now you are a realized soul.

185
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:29,583
You are a evolved state.

186
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:35,792
Now what is missing is the idea

187
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:41,208
that we are absolutely all right

188
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:46,000
and nothing can harm us, nothing can bring us down.

189
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:52,041
If you develop such an egoistical idea,

190
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:55,208
it’s not going to help you at all.

191
00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:58,709
What you have to do is to

192
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,333
all the time introspect yourself.

193
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,917
That’s what is meditation for,

194
00:15:04,291 --> 00:15:05,834
to see for yourself

195
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:10,291
how you are keeping up

196
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:13,959
your spiritual ascent.

197
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:15,875
No one else can do it,

198
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,709
it’s your own individual work.

199
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:20,959
Of course, if you go to the collective, immediately

200
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:24,000
they will know what chakras you are catching, no doubt.

201
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:28,125
They may not say, they may not refer it,

202
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:29,999
but they will know definitely

203
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,125
that such-and-such chakra is catching

204
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:34,458
and this person has this problem.

205
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:39,583
But they won’t know themselves what they are catching,

206
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:44,083
what is their problem is.

207
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,542
So if somebody tells you

208
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:48,792
that “I think this chakra is catching in you,”

209
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,792
you should never, never feel bad about it,

210
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,834
because by keeping that chakra intact

211
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:58,041
you are ruining your own life.

212
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:00,999
So what you have to do is to see

213
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,125
that if somebody tells you that

214
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,417
“I think this chakra is, there’s something wrong,”

215
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:10,375
you should thank that person, “Thank God you’ve told me.”

216
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:13,375
Like a mirror – if you see in the mirror

217
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,917
there’s something wrong with your face,

218
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,625
you can immediately correct it.

219
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:21,625
In the same way if somebody points it out to you,

220
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,417
you have to be mature enough that you should know

221
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,417
that it is a great blessing

222
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:30,917
that such thing has been pointed out to you.

223
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:33,583
Like the other day there was some quarrel

224
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:35,333
between the two leaders.

225
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:38,166
Always – there are two leaders, always there are quarrels.

226
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,750
There should not be.

227
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:43,542
It’s like two eyes never fight, two hands don’t fight,

228
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:45,208
two legs do not fight.

229
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:48,500
But if there are two leaders, there’s always a problem.

230
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:53,041
You have to have always one leader, otherwise big problem.

231
00:16:53,834 --> 00:16:56,625
So they were arguing among themselves, you see,

232
00:16:56,999 --> 00:17:01,583
two leaders arguing among themselves, and they came to Me.

233
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:05,625
Immediately I saw one of them was absolutely caught up.

234
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:08,291
I said, “You put your hands towards Me.”

235
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:10,291
When he puts his hand towards Me,

236
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:13,583
immediately he pushed it back. “What happened?”

237
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:16,125
He said, “I’m getting burning sensation, Mother.”

238
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,333
I said, “That’s it. Now, do you know what’s wrong with you?”

239
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,834
He says, “I’m very hot-tempered, that I know.

240
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,875
I’m very egoistical. I should not have behaved like this.”

241
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:32,959
But at the same time he could have felt very bad,

242
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,875
because I said it to him.

243
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,458
But he did not because he’s a Sahaja yogi

244
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,792
and he knows what is benevolent for him,

245
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,250
what is good for him.

246
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:45,000
He did not feel bad at all.

247
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,500
On the contrary, he was so thankful to Me that

248
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,667
“Mother, because of You I have been found out.

249
00:17:51,041 --> 00:17:55,417
Otherwise I was hiding it within my heart.”

250
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:06,000
Now, the problem with us is that

251
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:10,625
we have achieved a lot of development within ourself,

252
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:14,125
and we have consolidated it.

253
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,625
Also, we have a great collective force,

254
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,500
I can see, in every country.

255
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:22,667
We can give realizations to so many,

256
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,667
and we can really establish

257
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:30,792
all these great truths in our lives.

258
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,625
We can do it.

259
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:36,500
All the time we should establish them.

260
00:18:37,291 --> 00:18:40,667
But there is one point

261
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,125
on which one should not be very sure:

262
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:50,750
that you have absolutely reached the last truth.

263
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,417
You have to be careful on this point very much.

264
00:18:54,834 --> 00:19:00,625
I have seen people who go very high in Sahaja Yoga,

265
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,709
come up very high, and suddenly they go down very low.

266
00:19:06,792 --> 00:19:10,125
Makes Me very sad, extremely sad.

267
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:13,917
The reason is that they have no faith

268
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:20,875
– faith in themself and faith in Sahaj.

269
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,959
This is the faith which is missing.

270
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:30,166
You have to have faith in yourself and faith in Sahaj.

271
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,125
Sahaj means there is the divine Power,

272
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:43,458
and this all-pervading divine Power is looking after us.

273
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:51,166
It is now felt also, you have felt it.

274
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,291
It’s not that only by saying it’s there

275
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,709
– you have known that it is so.

276
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,709
But even knowing that,

277
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,542
it has not become such a faith within you.

278
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,792
But this is the faith about Christ has talked.

279
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,667
This is the faith with an enlightened mind,

280
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,500
not the blind faith.

281
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:14,333
And with the blind you might make mistakes,

282
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:18,875
while with the enlightened one if you have faith

283
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:24,125
you become extremely powerful, extremely powerful.

284
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,750
There cannot be any problems

285
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:30,583
if your faith is enlightened.

286
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,250
So now, you see in Sahaja Yoga

287
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:38,083
many people who are very steady,

288
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:43,000
who are upright,

289
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,875
who are very valuable.

290
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:48,208
They are like the people

291
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,750
who know they are standing on the rocks.

292
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:56,333
But those who are not yet so steady are the people,

293
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:59,750
they think they are still dwindling

294
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:05,834
on some sort of a funny waters of this life.

295
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:12,041
The rocks have been there, you’re standing on the rocks;

296
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,667
and also that has come out of faith

297
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,166
that nothing can disturb us, that faith,

298
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,166
nothing can trouble us.

299
00:21:23,709 --> 00:21:27,000
As far as Christ is concerned, naturally,

300
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:29,083
I mean, He knew everything,

301
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,500
so He was sure about it.

302
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,667
He never bothered, He never dwindled, He never doubted.

303
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,709
He knew that, that He is the Son of God,

304
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,750
and that was the fact that He knew very well.

305
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,917
And He never challenged it, He never doubted it, nothing.

306
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,166
It is so.

307
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:52,834
And that’s why He, I say, was standing on the rocks;

308
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,667
while the other people,

309
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:01,291
even Sahaja yogis,

310
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:04,959
have to become like Christ

311
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,208
as far as the faith is concerned.

312
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:13,166
This faith is to be understood.

313
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,792
This is an enlightened faith.

314
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:21,500
Like Christ – He went into crucifixion,

315
00:22:21,917 --> 00:22:24,375
He went into all kinds of things,

316
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:28,792
just because He knew it was just a drama

317
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:33,417
and He was doing all this just in a drama, playing;

318
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:37,166
and there’s nothing serious,

319
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:39,333
nothing is going to matter,

320
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,166
and that He’s going to resurrect Himself.

321
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:43,792
He played the drama.

322
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:47,750
To Him it was nothing very serious.

323
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:53,999
He saw people making fun of Him, mocking at Him.

324
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:58,750
He also in His heart knew everything that

325
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:03,125
“These people who are mocking don’t know what I am.”

326
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:07,999
But at the same time,

327
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,917
He was the embodiment of faith:

328
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:16,917
faith in Himself

329
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,999
and in this all-pervading Power.

330
00:23:22,417 --> 00:23:24,709
This never lets you down,

331
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:30,083
but for that you have to have absolute faith.

332
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:35,542
Supposing I have someone on whom I have faith,

333
00:23:36,792 --> 00:23:40,875
naturally I will give him all the work,

334
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,792
I will trust everything,

335
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:47,125
I’ll keep the keys with him or the money with him,

336
00:23:47,458 --> 00:23:50,750
never doubt such a person.

337
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:57,166
In the same way if you have faith – faith in yourself,

338
00:23:57,834 --> 00:24:04,625
faith in Sahaja Yoga where you are established

339
00:24:05,417 --> 00:24:09,542
– you’ll be surprised how things will work out,

340
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,125
how life will improve

341
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:18,709
and you will be standing on the rocks, you’ll feel that way.

342
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,542
You’ll have no doubts,

343
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:26,667
you’ll have no problems, no diseases.

344
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:33,458
So, this is such a state

345
00:24:33,999 --> 00:24:35,709
– only with faith.

346
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,959
But now this faith, how do you get?

347
00:24:39,375 --> 00:24:43,542
The problem is, how to get to this faith?

348
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:45,333
There’s no course about it,

349
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,542
there’s no literature about it,

350
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:50,166
there’s no lecture about it.

351
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:56,041
But there is an awakening within you

352
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,542
which will ask this

353
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,583
“What am I?” – this awakening,

354
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:06,375
“What am I? What have I achieved?”

355
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:12,208
You see, this will question

356
00:25:14,291 --> 00:25:18,083
“What is it that I have achieved?

357
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,750
What have I got out of Sahaja Yoga?”

358
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:24,792
All these questions will come to you.

359
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,333
But if you have faith,

360
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:30,166
not the blind but the enlightened

361
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:33,125
which is established by many miracles in life,

362
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,625
many things in life;

363
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:37,792
small, small things you’ll find there have been miracles,

364
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:39,333
small, small things.

365
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:41,750
There have been miracles even in big things,

366
00:25:42,125 --> 00:25:45,875
in so many things where you never expected this will happen.

367
00:25:46,291 --> 00:25:47,917
So now you know, very well settled,

368
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:51,834
that you are now very nicely in Sahaja Yoga.

369
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:54,917
For example, it starts raining.

370
00:25:55,417 --> 00:25:58,500
Half of you would get worried about it why it’s raining,

371
00:25:58,917 --> 00:26:01,542
but they will know that there’s a very beautiful roof,

372
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:03,125
nothing can happen.

373
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,667
Let it rain as much as it likes.

374
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:09,792
And then you’ll have faith that it is not going to rain,

375
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:11,875
it’s not going to drench us.

376
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:17,375
In the same way this faith within us

377
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,458
has to be absolutely solid,

378
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:26,125
and that makes you extremely strong

379
00:26:26,583 --> 00:26:29,000
and makes you responsible

380
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,625
for the resurrection of thousands

381
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:36,417
and thousands and thousands and thousands of people.

382
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:45,834
This kind of life that we have

383
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:52,917
– that only by our own establishment,

384
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:57,000
by our own understanding,

385
00:26:57,458 --> 00:27:03,041
by our own observation that we settle into ourselves,

386
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:06,625
we settle into Sahaja Yoga

387
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,208
– it’s something remarkable, but it should, it has happened,

388
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:15,792
it is happening, and should happen to all of you.

389
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:20,417
You all should have the chance

390
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:24,583
to know your spirit

391
00:27:25,041 --> 00:27:29,208
and to know yourself.

392
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:32,667
So one has to have faith in oneself.

393
00:27:33,125 --> 00:27:35,333
I’ve seen some Sahaja yoginis always come and say,

394
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:38,709
“Mother, I am no good, I am useless. I am doing no work.

395
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:43,083
I’m absolutely a lazy lump,” or whatever it is.

396
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:50,166
It’s all right, you think that way – ask for it.

397
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:53,792
What do you want?

398
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:58,458
Even if you don’t ask it will work out,

399
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:02,417
even if you don’t ask.

400
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:08,375
Even you just think about it, it will work out.

401
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:12,291
Even if you pay attention it will work out,

402
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:15,333
because this all-pervading Power

403
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,458
is the only real power,

404
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:20,750
the all the rest of the powers are useless.

405
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:28,333
And it’s so very efficient, so compassionate

406
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,083
that in the split of the second it can work out things.

407
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:40,750
The other day we had somebody from Australia,

408
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,834
and he was deceived by someone

409
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,667
and made him buy a land and a house

410
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:49,999
at a very exorbitant price, for which he had no money.

411
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:51,375
And this fellow said,

412
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:53,208
“Doesn’t matter even if you don’t have money,

413
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:55,291
they will not say anything to you.”

414
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,999
He believed him – had wrong faith,

415
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:02,000
I should say, and then he said, “All right.”

416
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:07,875
He paid all the money that he had, just to reserve it.

417
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:14,834
Somebody went there, there was a puja so so many went there.

418
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:21,333
So many pujas, you see, and things happened,

419
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,667
and so many people came and saw all this.

420
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:29,208
But this fellow was so upset, so upset,

421
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:30,875
he could not understand,

422
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:32,875
“Why it has happened to me

423
00:29:33,291 --> 00:29:37,250
that I am placed into such a difficult situation?”

424
00:29:39,041 --> 00:29:40,917
And he was deceived and he was,

425
00:29:41,583 --> 00:29:43,917
I mean, absolutely flabbergasted.

426
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:48,083
He had no idea as to how he will get out of this mess.

427
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:51,917
He had put in all his money there, everything was involved,

428
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:58,500
and if he doesn’t pay that money he would have been in jail.

429
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,542
I just wrote to him, “Have faith in yourself.”

430
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:08,041
That’s all – “Have faith.”

431
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,750
And what a miraculous thing happened,

432
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:15,875
that somebody else offered a much higher price for that.

433
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:20,834
And that fellow said,

434
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:24,250
“Of course I’ll pay it whatever you have promised.

435
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:27,667
I’ll pay you back, and I’ll pay you all the more

436
00:30:28,083 --> 00:30:31,917
that I want to pay.”

437
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:38,208
It’s something unbelievable.

438
00:30:40,417 --> 00:30:43,834
So many went there, so many wanted to solve the problem,

439
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:48,417
did this, met the fellow and told them that he cannot pay.

440
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:51,542
Nothing worked out, nothing

441
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:54,041
– only his faith.

442
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,166
And can you imagine, now he’s going to become a rich man.

443
00:30:58,834 --> 00:31:00,125
He was supposed to go to jail,

444
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,792
now he’s going to become a rich man.

445
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:04,583
There are many miracles like that, that happen.

446
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,583
This is just the financial side of it,

447
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:07,792
but I know you know

448
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:10,041
that there are so many other miracles happening.

449
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:14,667
After realization if you do not have faith, that shows,

450
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:18,500
I mean, you are a very poor personality.

451
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:22,583
After realization at least you should take to faith.

452
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,917
That really is something surprising

453
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,333
that people get their realization and everything,

454
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:33,083
still they do not have faith in themselves.

455
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:38,917
Those who have had, have really achieved so much.

456
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:44,291
Now, the difference between us and Christ is that

457
00:31:44,667 --> 00:31:47,333
faith was part and parcel of His being.

458
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:52,542
It was not that He had to have faith – He was faith.

459
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:56,125
Now we have to have it.

460
00:31:56,709 --> 00:32:00,375
We have to believe in ourselves.

461
00:32:01,041 --> 00:32:03,083
There’s so many incidents I can give you

462
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,959
which you can also tell Me, so many incidents

463
00:32:06,375 --> 00:32:10,375
where just the faith has helped.

464
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:14,125
If you were in Romania I think it happened,

465
00:32:14,625 --> 00:32:16,792
one lady came on the stage, she couldn’t walk,

466
00:32:17,166 --> 00:32:19,375
they had to bring her on a wheelchair.

467
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:23,542
And she said, “Mother, I know You can cure me.

468
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:25,999
Nobody can cure me; I know You can cure me.”

469
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:27,625
She said it three times.

470
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:29,959
I said, “So, you believe that I’ll cure you.”

471
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:32,583
“Yes.” I said, “Then get up.”

472
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:34,667
She just got up, walked out.

473
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:37,542
And then she started running all the way,

474
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:39,917
and everybody started laughing.

475
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,959
They said, “Mother, she’s not a Sahaja yogini!”

476
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,583
I said, “But see her faith!”

477
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:51,125
Because when there is faith all the deities take it up:

478
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:58,458
they’re challenged, they have to do it.

479
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:02,166
They have shown faith in that person.

480
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:04,000
As I have told you always,

481
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:07,333
in Sahaja Yoga we trust people, we trust.

482
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:09,417
One among hundred might deceive us

483
00:33:09,709 --> 00:33:11,208
doesn’t matter, we trust.

484
00:33:11,583 --> 00:33:15,333
That faith you put in that person works in his mind also,

485
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,542
that “they have put so much faith in me.”

486
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:20,834
But what about deities?

487
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,166
You show faith in them and it works,

488
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:25,917
immediately they work out.

489
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:27,583
Like Guido told Me that

490
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:30,709
“Mother, they said there will be heavy rains

491
00:33:31,208 --> 00:33:32,875
for these two days.”

492
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:37,375
I said, “All right. Don’t worry.” ,Where is the rain?

493
00:33:38,625 --> 00:33:41,458
It disappeared.

494
00:33:41,917 --> 00:33:47,458
You can control anything if your faith is under control.

495
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:54,291
And when we talk of faith, you know,

496
00:33:55,125 --> 00:34:00,583
it’s the challenge to this all-pervading Power,

497
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:06,417
which organizes, which knows everything,

498
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:09,041
which is so intelligent, efficient

499
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:10,999
– above all, it loves you.

500
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:14,458
And then you show faith.

501
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,125
The resurrection in Sahaja Yoga is that your faith is solid.

502
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:29,083
This you have to achieve: solid faith.

503
00:34:29,709 --> 00:34:31,000
They don’t feel then bad,

504
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:34,125
supposing I may not meet them, supposing I may say,

505
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,000
“All right, come. You see, this time I may not be there.”

506
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:40,458
Nothing matters, you see, whether Mother meets us or not,

507
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:43,375
whether this thing happens or not.

508
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:47,792
Everything is for our good, for our benevolence.

509
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:49,458
Supposing you are lost on the way,

510
00:34:49,834 --> 00:34:53,125
know that it has to be that way.

511
00:34:53,959 --> 00:34:57,667
If you have to look at the life of Christ,

512
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:59,583
He was to be crucified.

513
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:01,417
He had to carry the cross,

514
00:35:01,875 --> 00:35:05,375
He had to do all these things – it’s all right, whatever.

515
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:07,792
“It’s fated. I’ll do it.”

516
00:35:08,125 --> 00:35:10,667
He never grumbled, He never grudged,

517
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:15,041
He didn’t want anybody to share His problems.

518
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:18,583
But this faith in Him gave Him

519
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:24,083
such a tremendous powers.

520
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,208
He could have done anything.

521
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,709
He could have killed all these people

522
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,625
who were trying to persecute Him, easily – what’s the harm?

523
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,959
Just one glance could have killed them.

524
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:39,417
But no, He knew He had to go through all that,

525
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:40,959
He went through it.

526
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:44,792
Ultimately, He is the one who’s victorious,

527
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:48,000
He is the one who won everything.

528
00:35:48,709 --> 00:35:50,542
In the same way, a Sahaja yogi

529
00:35:50,917 --> 00:35:52,750
has to look at one’s own life.

530
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:59,542
It’s very precious, life, it’s very precious in this world.

531
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:04,583
These days, the how many there are Sahaja yogis?

532
00:36:05,083 --> 00:36:06,999
In the evolutionary process

533
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:10,959
how many will become Sahaja yogis, I can’t say.

534
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:17,792
And once look at the world, then you start feeling that

535
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:20,834
most of it is going to be destroyed or finished,

536
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:24,000
most of the people are not going to be there.

537
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:25,917
Not that we are not available,

538
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:31,999
but because they are not fated

539
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,250
to come to Sahaja Yoga,

540
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,875
they’re not meant to come to Sahaja Yoga.

541
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,792
So, you are so fortunate

542
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:43,041
that you have got your realization, your resurrection.

543
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:46,417
But now have faith in that resurrection of yours,

544
00:36:46,834 --> 00:36:51,250
in your resurrection that is your being now.

545
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:54,792
And with that you will know how precious

546
00:36:55,166 --> 00:36:57,959
you are for the whole world,

547
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,458
and that what you have to do is not

548
00:37:00,792 --> 00:37:03,542
to think of material gains, physical gains

549
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:09,250
or some emotional gains, but spiritual gains.

550
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:14,667
What have we done for spirituality, our own and of others?

551
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,208
This is the only thing that you have to think about,

552
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:19,834
and you’ll be amazed, everything is organized,

553
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:21,291
everything works out,

554
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:25,458
everything in its own time shows its own results.

555
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:31,417
Now I am sure at least eighty percent of you

556
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:36,959
believe into what I am saying – maybe, say, ninety percent.

557
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,917
But there could be about ten percent who still think that

558
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,750
“All right, Mother says so.

559
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:51,291
But then why it happened, why that happened?”

560
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:53,542
Like the other day I had a journalist,

561
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,959
very well-known person, he said, “I can’t believe in God.”

562
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:58,333
I said, “Why?”

563
00:37:58,667 --> 00:38:03,000
“Because how can there be such miseries in this world?

564
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:05,375
How can there be a blind child,

565
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:08,166
how can this and how can that?”

566
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:11,083
Then he started giving Me instances. “All right now,”

567
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:13,208
I said, “have you told Me everything?” "Yes".

568
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,917
I said, “Now, supposing we say that

569
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:22,208
you are sitting in the realm of congress government,

570
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:27,083
or your Andreotti government or whatever you call it.

571
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:31,917
So the situation is explainable;

572
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:36,792
you have not yet gone into the realm of God.

573
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,250
If you go to that state, and if you achieve it

574
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:43,542
and if you settle down, then tell Me,

575
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,959
have you any problems? None.”

576
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:53,000
I said, “Why do you see to the negative side?

577
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:57,208
Now if you say that there is a way out

578
00:38:57,667 --> 00:39:00,667
and that there is a solution,

579
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:04,125
and that a time can come

580
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:07,375
when in this race of Sahaja yogis there will be no diseases,

581
00:39:07,792 --> 00:39:11,166
no troubles, nothing, no problems;

582
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:14,667
so why not see this?

583
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:18,750
Why do you want to see one boy who is blind?

584
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:23,999
But why don’t you see that the blind become all right?”

585
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:27,834
So this kind of negative attitude

586
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:30,333
also Sahaja yogis can have.

587
00:39:30,792 --> 00:39:33,041
I’ve seen them: somebody’s sick,

588
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,999
they’ll say, “Mother, he’s sick. I must bring him to You.

589
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,542
You must see them.” There’s no need at all.

590
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:44,542
You can cure, your faith can cure.

591
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:47,875
You know about somebody whose uncle was sick,

592
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,500
who was not a Sahaja yogi.

593
00:39:49,999 --> 00:39:53,625
He went down there to see him, and his wife said that

594
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:56,250
“You are capable of praying to Mother.

595
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:01,166
Why don’t you tell Her to get my husband all right?”

596
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:04,375
He was a cancer patient on deathbed.

597
00:40:04,834 --> 00:40:07,583
He said, “All right.” He just bowed down and he prayed,

598
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:10,083
“Mother, please cure my uncle.”

599
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,959
Third day he was out of hospital,

600
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:14,417
and now he’s roaming about all over the world.

601
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:18,417
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, still it has worked;

602
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:21,041
because now a Sahaja yogi saying that,

603
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:23,709
the deities have to work it out.

604
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:27,333
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, doesn’t matter.

605
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:30,709
It’s the deities who stood by it.

606
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:41,125
And this one has to believe in oneself, fully,

607
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:47,917
that if these powers are with us, why not we use it?

608
00:40:48,667 --> 00:40:52,166
Why not we develop that complete faith

609
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:54,542
that we are now Sahaja yogis,

610
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:57,917
we are in the Kingdom of God,

611
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:02,667
and that this Power is going to look after us?

612
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:05,792
Then we’ll have no choices,

613
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:12,125
we’ll have no hesitation.

614
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,542
We’ll not bother, if you have to go to, say,

615
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:19,417
to Singapore or you have to go to Africa

616
00:41:19,834 --> 00:41:21,999
or go anywhere – so what?

617
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:25,667
We are still in the Kingdom of God wherever we go,

618
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:28,667
it’s perfectly all right.

619
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:31,583
And no worry of any kind.

620
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,542
We are slaves of so many things, of our watches,

621
00:41:34,875 --> 00:41:37,291
we are slaves of conditionings, things like that.

622
00:41:37,667 --> 00:41:39,417
Everything drops out.

623
00:41:39,834 --> 00:41:41,125
Doesn’t matter.

624
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:44,417
What does it matter? Nothing is important.

625
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:48,667
As long as you are with yourself, everything is all right.

626
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:50,083
Like people tell Me,

627
00:41:50,417 --> 00:41:51,792
“Mother, You travel so much. How do You do it?”

628
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:54,917
I said, “I never travel. As I am sitting here in the chair,

629
00:41:55,166 --> 00:41:57,750
I am sitting there in the chair, that’s all;

630
00:41:58,208 --> 00:41:59,333
only the seat is changed.

631
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,000
I never think I’m traveling. Nicely sitting down,

632
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:07,125
settled in My seat I’m all right, so I am not tired.”

633
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:14,709
So when you have complete faith in yourself,

634
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,792
then you don’t bother.

635
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,709
Many people will find out whether

636
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:23,458
“I go there – there’ll be a bathroom or not,

637
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:28,375
or there will be a place to sleep or not?” Nothing.

638
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:33,291
You are looking for the comfort of your spirit.

639
00:42:33,709 --> 00:42:37,333
If you get, well and good, otherwise you can sleep anywhere.

640
00:42:37,834 --> 00:42:40,709
Nothing can bind you,

641
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:42,917
nothing can pull you down,

642
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:47,083
no habit can come back on you;

643
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:54,375
because faith will purify you completely,

644
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:58,000
it will enlighten you, it will nourish you.

645
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,291
This faith is not something

646
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,375
that can be put into your heads

647
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:08,375
or can be put into your hearts, cannot be.

648
00:43:09,083 --> 00:43:13,917
It’s a state which you have to achieve,

649
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:19,625
and which you can achieve through Sahaja Yoga.

650
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:24,834
That’s how our resurrection would be complete,

651
00:43:25,959 --> 00:43:27,959
would be established,

652
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:30,125
would be effective,

653
00:43:30,542 --> 00:43:35,917
and for the whole world will be a model.

654
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,083
May God bless you all.

655
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:18,375
There are just the children, there are so many children.

656
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:22,959
Today is the day of Christ,

657
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:27,417
so we should have children in any case to wash My feet.

658
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:33,709
Can you fit it there, or you will have to move it?
