1
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,360
It’s my privilege and pleasure to introduce

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,880
the first of our distinguished guest-speakers.

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,720
He bears a famous name

4
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,480
and needs very little in the way of introduction.

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,600
Alfred Nobel, the Swedish chemist and industrialist

6
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,600
of course, he was the man who invented dynamites

7
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,880
and left his fortune to be used for the Nobel Prize

8
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,800
himself was a bachelor,

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,840
but Mr. Claes Nobel is his grandnephew.

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:09,320
He was inspired by the work of his distinguished forebear

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,200
and has himself had the inspiration to found an organization

12
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,760
which is called “United Earth”, which he is still the chairman.

13
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,880
And this organization has itself instituted a prize

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,080
in the ecological sphere

15
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,920
which is not one of the Nobel Prizes, there is no prize for ecology.

16
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,720
And this prize he calls “Earth Ethics”.

17
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,240
He met Shri Mataji last year in India

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,600
when he was the chairman of the World Philosophers conference.

19
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,280
So without any more ado, I’dd like to

20
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,000
invite Mr. Claes Nobel to come on to the stage, please.

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,120
Well, indeed, life is full of surprises,

22
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,840
after all we are meeting here inspired by the message and work

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,080
by Holy Mother Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

24
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:33,200
and She is not here in body, but She is here in Spirits.

25
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,440
Also the wonderful letter that we recently heard

26
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,280
from ayatollah Ruhani

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,280
which speaks very highly about the work and the mission

28
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,680
of the Holy Mother,

29
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,560
where he indicates the importance of women

30
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,400
in the world is needed here.

31
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,400
And frankly speaking, only 36 hours ago

32
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,000
I did not know that I would be here

33
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,360
tonight at the Royal Albert Hall,

34
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,920
addressing this audience.

35
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:17,080
Still I say: Dear Holy Mother,

36
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:25,120
and I also recognize her husband Sir C.P. Srivastava in the audience,

37
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,840
and I say, most importantly: dear friends, fellow-seekers of truth,

38
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,200
Are you out there? Because with all this light,

39
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,120
I can only see about 20 people in front of me.

40
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,320
So, say “yes”, if you are in here, then I know…

41
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,720
Ah…

42
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,840
Now I can see you, I can here you as well as you can see and here me.

43
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,200
With that said, I want to say I have a vision,

44
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:08,080
I have a vision for a world that is better, safer and saner

45
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,600
than the one that we presently are experiencing.

46
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,360
It is a world where people live in harmony and peace with themselves

47
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,000
and in harmony and peace with Nature.

48
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,480
Now, those words of vast, it’s a bold vision,

49
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,600
do I have a practical way of going from vision to reality?

50
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,280
Yes, I will share that with you.

51
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,560
And I will share it and indicate a tone of the meeting

52
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,440
by ten small words.

53
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,680
And they indicate how this global world transformation

54
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,120
should be undertaken.

55
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:05,320
And they are: Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Deeds,

56
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,560
Right Here and Right Now.

57
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:20,960
The key word, the key word is, of course, “right”,

58
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,240
this world is fighting about what is right,

59
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,320
what is right to you might be wrong to me or vice-versa,

60
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,200
it’s a grey area.

61
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,240
So we need a reference point,

62
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,720
so we can distinguish between right and wrong

63
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,560
and between truth and lie.

64
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,000
Tonight Shri Mataji will show us what is right.

65
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,800
Tonight Shri Mataji will empower us

66
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,640
to become the masters of our own destiny.

67
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,680
And tonight we’ll be guided

68
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,920
by the knowledge of Self Realization.

69
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,040
We will do so in the light of Truth

70
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,680
and we shall all know absolute truth and absolute peace.

71
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,800
Now, 100 years ago Alfred Nobel established the Nobel Prizes.

72
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,280
These prizes represent excellence.

73
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,840
We have prizes in chemistry, physics, medicine, literature

74
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,320
and peace.

75
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:46,920
All those prizes, I hold the peace prize to be the finest.

76
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,080
And I want to tell you that Alfred Nobel listened to a woman,

77
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,840
he listened to his secretary Bertha von Suttner in Paris

78
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,920
100 years ago when she said:

79
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,600
”Dr. Nobel, you should use your vast fortune

80
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,040
for betterment of the world”.

81
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,600
Tonight we are listening to another woman,

82
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,840
we are listening to the message of Shri Mataji.

83
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,160
However, I am very much inspired first by my uncle

84
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,120
and later on, you will hear, by Shri Mataji.

85
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:31,280
Alfred Nobel talked much about peace.

86
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,080
He was frightened that his awesome explosive dynamite

87
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,360
which cleared up land for harbors and tunnels

88
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,600
could also be used for war affair.

89
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,680
Today, in the arsenal of military systems,

90
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,920
it’s like a small fire cracker,

91
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,720
but at that time dynamite was a most awesome destructive material.

92
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,920
Now, Alfred Nobel thought basically

93
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:04,680
about peace as absence of war.

94
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,440
But I assure you that peace is much more than absence of war.

95
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,360
And I see that peace exists in four specific areas.

96
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:23,320
The first area is the peace that an individual has in him or herself

97
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,680
how do we treat our mind, our emotions and our feelings?

98
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,240
How do we treat our body?

99
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,320
Are we slaves to other masters

100
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,800
or are we our own master?

101
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,600
Until we have the inner peace in ourselves,

102
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,280
we can never have an outer peace in the world.

103
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,520
And the safest and best way of finding world peace

104
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,360
is to have mass movements that include all religions and philosophies,

105
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:04,760
all enterprises, whether they are of political or scientific nature,

106
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,480
to realize what inner peace is.

107
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,840
And that’s what we are talking about tonight: Self Realization.

108
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,200
What does Self Realization mean?

109
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,680
Well, it means that we are realizing something, but what is the Self?

110
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:27,240
Ladies and gentlemen, the Self in us is the Divine Cosmic Power

111
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,360
that exist in each and every individual,

112
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,560
but which is dormant in most people around the world.

113
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,160
The spiritual leaders from ancient lores,

114
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,360
they knew about this and they spoke about this.

115
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,440
But this secret of secrets has been suppressed deliberately

116
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,120
until Shri Mataji with great courage and great wisdom,

117
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,840
being an old soul would decided by Herself

118
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,440
to come back to the Earth at this critical time in our history,

119
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,040
in order to share Her knowledge and wisdom

120
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,640
which is the Sahaja Yoga,

121
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,720
which is instant Self Realization,

122
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,120
which is to activate the dormant principle

123
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,080
that we all have: the Kundalini,

124
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,120
and have the Kundalini to rise up and thus we become

125
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,120
what it says in the Bible: “You are created in My image”.

126
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,120
That was the first category, first sphere of peace

127
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
the one we have in ourselves.

128
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:49,840
The next one is the peace that we have among each other

129
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,200
in the family, in our community, in our nation,

130
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,240
that we have peace with other ethnic groups

131
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,520
and with other religions,

132
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:07,280
that we really become true what I call “active listeners”

133
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:11,240
And, as “active listeners” are able to put ourselves

134
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:18,240
in the place, in the shoes of the other party.

135
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,800
Only then, when we have the outlook from their perspective,

136
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,360
shall we understand what they are trying to say.

137
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,120
We are always talking, talking, talking.

138
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,360
My dear wife, who is not here tonight,

139
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,080
she said: ”Claes, you talk too much, you don’t listen”.

140
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,800
I have start to practice what she calls “active listening”.

141
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,360
The third sphere is a sphere that put me in, originally.

142
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,640
After all, I am a European Swedish business man,

143
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,760
why am I up here speaking the language of spirituality

144
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,240
and saying that that is where the hope of the future exists?

145
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,480
I am doing so, because I have a deep and profound

146
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,600
reverence for Nature,

147
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,240
as a Nobel Peace laureate Dr. Albert Schweitzer said.

148
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,560
After, he add, worked and worked, trying to

149
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,480
distil the phrase that contained everything that he knew,

150
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,400
everything he wanted to say through his philosophy,

151
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,400
Dr. Albert Schweitzer calling the phrase “reverence for Life”

152
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,760
Nature is nothing but a plethora

153
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,920
of examples of life in its multifaceted version.

154
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,440
And I tell you, dear fellows seekers of Truth,

155
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,600
we, humanity today, in our ignorance,

156
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,880
in our greed and in our lust for power,

157
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,240
we are in the process of destroying the

158
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,920
very thing that makes this planet unique

159
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,480
and that is Life on Earth.

160
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,560
And, so far, we do not know of another planet in the universe

161
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,400
that harbors this miracle.

162
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:18,840
Earth is like a blue jewel in space

163
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,520
and is only one Earth and this Earth is fragile

164
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,360
and we must take care of her and respect her.

165
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,800
Earth is also called Nature.

166
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,080
We cannot break the laws of Nature,

167
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,760
we must live by the laws of Nature.

168
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,800
If we break them, Mother Earth will break us.

169
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,000
And we are only one species of –

170
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,280
we don’t know how many species we have – 5, 10, 15 millions.

171
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,400
But this we know

172
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,160
and this is being proven by the world foremost scientist

173
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,760
in Harvard University U.S., Dr. Edward O. Wilson:

174
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:07,200
we are today bringing to extinction 250 species per day.

175
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,080
That is as if we are deliberately and willfully

176
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,840
pulling out thread after thread after thread

177
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,600
of what consists the fabric of life

178
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,000
and Mother Nature will not let us continue doing that

179
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,840
without correcting us as naughty children.

180
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:31,520
The fourth sphere of peace is the peace that we shall know

181
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,160
between ourselves and God.

182
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,320
Any religion or any group

183
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,160
who raises their arms and destroys its enemy

184
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,280
in the name of God is not following what God has asked us to do.

185
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,920
The world should not know of violence

186
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,920
and the world should not know of war.

187
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,760
I call, as you earlier heard, these four spheres of peace

188
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,840
“Earth Ethics”

189
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,680
And tonight we will hear more from the Holy Mother

190
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,120
how we shall have a reference point, how we can distinguish

191
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,880
if we have a charlatan and a fraud in front of us,

192
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,080
or if it’s a genuine honest person.

193
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,400
And you, dear audience, you have come here tonight

194
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,320
from many different walks of life.

195
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:40,160
And like you, I have also been seeking for the truth.

196
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:46,240
I am beginning to discern truth rather clearly

197
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,080
and let me tell you this, that I look upon life on Earth

198
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,320
as a kind of a school, a school

199
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,480
where we are learning perfection and purification.

200
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,800
Now on Earth everything is interdependent,

201
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,160
interactive and interrelated.

202
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,400
And on Earth, as well as in Heaven, I guess

203
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,760
every action has a reaction,

204
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,680
every effect has a cause, every cause has an effect.

205
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:25,280
And the Holy Mother, as I said, She is a highly evolved soul,

206
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,200
She has learned from many many lives

207
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,640
what it is all about

208
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,720
and these what it is all about laws, the unseen laws,

209
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,520
the spiritual laws,

210
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,360
they’re always here and they work as infallible

211
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,560
as the law of gravity works.

212
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,320
It always works, all those unseen laws.

213
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,240
It is for us to learn and perceive that law.

214
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:04,200
I am very comfortable with the teachings of Shri Mataji

215
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,640
and I am very comfortable with the Holy Mother Herself.

216
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,840
I say so because in the Bible there is one saying

217
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:22,480
among several good ones: “You shall know the tree by its fruit”.

218
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,880
And lately, I have met young men and women

219
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,360
in different parts of the world,

220
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,560
and certainly from many different parts of the world

221
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,720
and they are all shining, beautiful human individuals

222
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,720
that radiate inner peace and balance.

223
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,600
They are unique.

224
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,440
You who follow or who are in a process of following

225
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:53,080
will be, I think,

226
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,200
those individuals who shall call themselves

227
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,000
“ambassadors for the Earth”.

228
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,520
And after tonight session is over,

229
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,400
I’m sure that you shall see clearly

230
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,840
how you shall distinguish between truth and lie

231
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:16,440
and you shall realize that blind faith

232
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:23,520
is of no value and that fanaticism and

233
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:31,240
to take up violence as a last argument is of no value:

234
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,120
eventually those things will bring you unhappiness

235
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:41,280
and will bring you conflict and potential war.

236
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:51,440
Ladies and gentlemen, I know that we hold the future in our hands.

237
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,000
I know that the future is in your hands

238
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,800
I know it’s in my hands.

239
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,320
And I also know that the future of the planet

240
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,640
exists in the heart of the individuals.

241
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,840
Now, I will close my remarks tonight by a fable from India.

242
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,360
I heard it when I attended the Rio Conference ’92,

243
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,080
that was the 20-th anniversary of the Stockholm Conference,

244
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,520
that for the first time put on the environment on the world agenda.

245
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,680
In Stockholm ’72 we had only two heads of states:

246
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,600
the prime minister of India and the king of Sweden.

247
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,840
In Rio, 20 years later, we had 110 heads of states.

248
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,440
A marvelous declaration was drafted, “Agenda 21”.

249
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,200
Just last week in New York there were 70 heads of state

250
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,200
that continued with “Rio plus 5”.

251
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,680
What is I told Sir C.P. when he asked me

252
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,360
about how is the outcome of this conference,

253
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,360
I said: Well, we are talking about sustainable future,

254
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,400
for it seems to me that in UN there is much

255
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,480
of a sustainable dialogue ongoing.

256
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,720
Tonight we should take the action.

257
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,600
Well, I asked the holy man from India, a white robed Acharya

258
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,760
and I said:

259
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,520
“Is there hope for the future?”.

260
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:30,560
And he said: “Mr. Nobel, I will answer your question as follows”,

261
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,320
and this is what he said: “When the Dear Lord had created the Earth,

262
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,840
He was very very happy, very very very pleased,

263
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,600
it was His finest creation in the Universe

264
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,440
and He decided to celebrate, to have a party.

265
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:56,040
And God invited in all angels and all the devils.

266
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,040
When they were there,

267
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,840
He toasted them and wished them welcome as a good host

268
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
and said:

269
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,360
There is only one rule that you must strictly obey while you are here

270
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,440
having a good time. And, by the way,

271
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,880
the best food and the best wine was served, the ambrosia and nectar.

272
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,160
And He said: "There is one rule and that is that while you are here"

273
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:26,320
celebrating My creation, you may never bend your elbows.

274
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,400
The devils cried out and said:

275
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,120
We don’t want any part of such party.

276
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,080
How can we enjoy it, not bending our elbows?!

277
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,720
So they left.

278
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,320
Then the party started,

279
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,880
the angels were having a jolly good time

280
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,360
and the Dear God was very very happy.”

281
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:55,480
Now, how could they eat and drink, without bending their elbows?

282
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:04,880
Well, I sense that you can see what the moral of the fable is.

283
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,240
The angels were feeding each other,

284
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,920
they were sharing and they were caring,

285
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:18,880
and that is what we shall do in the future together.

286
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,880
Thank you very much.
