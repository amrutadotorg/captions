00:00.785 --> 00:05.831
ï»¿I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:06.838 --> 00:14.775
At the very outset, I have to tell you that truth is what it is.

00:15.466 --> 00:19.536
We cannot change it.

00:19.965 --> 00:24.418
We cannot describe it.

00:24.672 --> 00:33.400
Unfortunately, at this human awareness, we cannot feel it.

00:34.298 --> 00:42.595
Absolute truth has to be felt on you central nervous system.

00:46.092 --> 00:49.624
Now, whatever I am going to tell you tonight,

00:49.825 --> 00:58.370
you have to take it not for granted at all.

00:59.274 --> 01:05.753
We have had inner problems of blind faith.

01:06.870 --> 01:15.052
But if you treat it as a hypothesis and if it is proved,

01:15.253 --> 01:20.878
then you have to accept it as honest people.

01:24.431 --> 01:31.333
The truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this intellect,

01:31.534 --> 01:37.307
these emotions, these conditioning and ego.

01:38.369 --> 01:43.337
But you are the pure Spirit.

01:48.786 --> 01:55.864
Here now you see beautiful flowers and we take it for granted.

01:56.446 --> 02:01.188
Actually it is a miracle.

02:04.721 --> 02:09.494
Many livings things, we take it for granted.

02:11.384 --> 02:15.935
Who runs your heart? If you ask the doctor,

02:16.136 --> 02:20.810
he will say: "It is autonomous nervous system."

02:21.059 --> 02:25.788
But who is this "auto"?

02:27.318 --> 02:30.100
So the second truth is that

02:30.301 --> 02:37.343
there's a All-Pervading Subtle Power of Divine Love

02:37.981 --> 02:41.577
that does all the living work.

02:45.109 --> 02:54.696
We cannot feel this Power on our fingers, but it exists.

02:55.393 --> 03:00.154
Today for the first time you all are going to feel it.

03:01.189 --> 03:08.033
It is called in the Bible as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

03:10.706 --> 03:17.500
In the Koran, it is called as Ruh.

03:18.217 --> 03:24.413
And in the Indian scriptures, it is called as Paramchaitanya.

03:25.990 --> 03:31.958
Patanjali has called it as Ritambhara Pragya.

03:33.064 --> 03:35.614
So in all the books,

03:35.815 --> 03:42.417
this Chaitanya has been described by different names.

03:43.530 --> 03:47.853
So "saha" means "with, "ja" means "born",

03:48.054 --> 03:55.077
is the right to have this yoga, this union.

03:55.411 --> 04:02.770
You all have this right to have this union with the Divine Power.

04:03.673 --> 04:11.149
Specially at this time, it was to happen.

04:11.851 --> 04:15.881
It's already been predicted.

04:16.976 --> 04:20.781
They called as Last Judgment,

04:20.982 --> 04:24.607
in the Koran they called it as Kyiama.

04:26.164 --> 04:29.906
And the great astrologer, the pioneer of Astrology,

04:30.107 --> 04:39.014
Gehrig has written that at this time, thousands will get their enlightenment.

04:39.224 --> 04:41.746
I call it a blossom time,

04:43.638 --> 04:48.509
where there are so many seekers of truth

04:48.710 --> 04:53.662
who have a right to get their enlightenment.

04:55.018 --> 05:03.409
So it is through the evolutionary process, the last breakthrough.

05:03.957 --> 05:09.524
This Power that connects you to the All-Pervading Power

05:09.725 --> 05:15.689
is called as Kundalini.

05:18.300 --> 05:23.880
"Kundal" is different circles.

05:26.376 --> 05:30.406
That's why it is called as Kundalini.

05:31.099 --> 05:36.706
It rests in the triangular bone which is called as sacrum,

05:36.907 --> 05:43.418
that means that Greeks knew that is a sacred bone.

05:45.043 --> 05:53.058
When this Power rises, it passes through six centers.

05:54.622 --> 05:59.045
All the problems of the world

05:59.246 --> 06:03.958
are mostly from human beings.

06:05.365 --> 06:09.318
And most of the problems of human beings

06:09.519 --> 06:14.019
come from these subtle centers within us.

06:14.778 --> 06:19.678
Thus when this Kundalini rises and passes through six centers

06:19.879 --> 06:26.943
and enlightens the fontanel bone area, passes through it,

06:27.144 --> 06:31.597
then it enlightens all the centers.

06:32.015 --> 06:39.093
It integrates it and also it corrects it.

06:41.600 --> 06:49.132
These centers are for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being.

06:50.022 --> 06:55.460
Thus all our problems

06:55.661 --> 07:02.242
on physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being are solved.

07:02.439 --> 07:07.915
In Delhi, there are two doctors who have got their MD

07:08.116 --> 07:13.052
for curing incurable diseases in Sahara Yoga.

07:14.580 --> 07:22.172
All over the world, we have doctors who are curing people

07:22.373 --> 07:26.335
of incurable diseases.

07:28.032 --> 07:35.001
The second thing that happens to you that your attention becomes innocent.

07:36.060 --> 07:41.178
Innocence is eternal, it's never lost.

07:41.379 --> 07:47.244
Of course there are some clouds on it.

07:47.894 --> 07:56.878
But with the awakening of the Kundalini, your innocence is established.

07:57.320 --> 08:03.835
And your attention becomes innocent devoided of lust and greed.

08:04.554 --> 08:10.577
Such an innocence, innocent attention is very powerful.

08:12.427 --> 08:20.372
And wherever it goes, it emits peace and joy.

08:21.562 --> 08:26.392
The another thing that happens to you automatically

08:26.593 --> 08:33.132
is that you can feel these centers on your fingertips.

08:33.565 --> 08:36.665
Is not going to people at all, is not,

08:36.866 --> 08:40.648
they can't hear Me.

08:47.596 --> 08:50.706
Is alright?

08:54.308 --> 09:04.435
This attention is innocent, but also is active.

09:05.140 --> 09:12.114
You can cure your centers by your pure attention.

09:13.155 --> 09:20.264
Also you can feel the centers of others on your fingertips.

09:21.324 --> 09:24.538
In the Koran, it is written very clearly

09:24.739 --> 09:29.148
that at the time of Kyiama, that is the resurrection,

09:29.349 --> 09:35.712
your hands will speak and they will give witness against you.

09:36.260 --> 09:40.166
So your attention, whenever you put it,

09:40.367 --> 09:47.343
is so pure that it acts on others also.

09:47.818 --> 09:51.591
But who is the other?

09:52.944 --> 09:59.570
Because you become, you become again collectively conscious,

09:59.771 --> 10:04.748
that you can feel the attention of others very clearly

10:04.949 --> 10:12.774
on your fingertips, the centers of others on your fingertips.

10:14.403 --> 10:20.887
Thus you have self-knowledge on you central nervous system.

10:23.449 --> 10:30.926
For example, we go to religion to find out a solution.

10:31.127 --> 10:35.746
For example, people like Christ and Mohammed Saab,

10:35.947 --> 10:43.717
very highly evolved Incarnations came on this Earth.

10:45.934 --> 10:52.339
We could not understand Them and They could not understand human beings.

10:52.657 --> 10:56.806
They did not know what sort of people they are facing.

10:57.773 --> 11:01.932
For example, Christ has said in the fifth chapter, Mathews,

11:02.133 --> 11:08.445
if your one eye commits a sin, take it down.

11:09.252 --> 11:16.852
And if your hand commits a sin, cut it out.

11:17.919 --> 11:24.980
If someone slaps you on one cheek, you turn another cheek.

11:25.181 --> 11:28.467
I Myself was born in a Christian family

11:28.668 --> 11:36.130
and I never see any man doing that without two eyes and without two hands.

11:37.066 --> 11:40.980
Christ was talking to saints.

11:41.337 --> 11:45.075
That's why He talked,

11:45.276 --> 11:49.424
that He was talking to angels.

11:49.625 --> 11:53.928
And Mohammed Saab was even worse,

11:54.129 --> 11:57.757
because He thought Christ has been very strict on men,

11:57.958 --> 12:01.477
why not on women? So He also said horrible things

12:01.678 --> 12:05.785
that have to be done to women.

12:06.324 --> 12:10.304
That if a woman looks another man with lust,

12:10.505 --> 12:13.391
she must be buried half in the Mother Earth

12:13.592 --> 12:17.717
and should be stoned till she is dead.

12:18.324 --> 12:23.785
Imagine what would have happened to American women, I can't understand.

12:25.202 --> 12:29.139
Where they could have been?

12:31.054 --> 12:38.721
On top of that, Shariat, which was given by Moses to the Jews,

12:38.922 --> 12:42.976
who were very decadent, greed took it over,

12:43.177 --> 12:46.753
because Jews defied it.

12:47.923 --> 12:52.551
So we can see that these restrictions

12:52.752 --> 12:57.002
are for people who are enlightened.

12:57.401 --> 13:01.531
And not for ordinary human beings.

13:02.286 --> 13:08.997
So first ordinary human beings have to become enlightened.

13:09.353 --> 13:13.587
They have to enter into the Kingdon of God.

13:15.640 --> 13:20.601
There only they can be punished like this.

13:21.381 --> 13:26.178
But in Sahaja Yoga, we have no punishments.

13:26.569 --> 13:31.576
Forgiveness is the only remedy,

13:32.425 --> 13:35.413
up to a point.

13:35.614 --> 13:41.218
And even after that if people continue to do wrong,

13:41.419 --> 13:46.245
then they are requested to get out of Sahaja Yoga.

13:46.549 --> 13:50.993
But once you get enlightenment, you become righteous,

13:51.194 --> 13:55.339
nobody has to tell you: "Don't do this, don't do that."

13:56.081 --> 14:02.132
In the light of the Spirit, you become your guide, your own master.

14:03.671 --> 14:07.135
Whatever is destructive, you give up

14:07.336 --> 14:11.500
and take to constructive for you life.

14:11.701 --> 14:15.165
This is like this, supposing I am an obstinate person

14:15.366 --> 14:20.241
and I have a snake in My hand and there's darkness.

14:20.664 --> 14:23.777
And you tell Me that there's a snake,

14:23.978 --> 14:29.517
but I will not give up because I am obstinate till the snake bites Me.

14:29.936 --> 14:34.975
But if there's a little light, immediately I will Myself give up.

14:35.208 --> 14:39.270
Nobody has to tell Me.

14:39.502 --> 14:44.190
You yourself become virtuous and righteous.

14:44.791 --> 14:53.458
So your health becomes first class, your mind becomes first class,

14:53.659 --> 14:59.472
because of that, your financial problems are also solved.

15:01.469 --> 15:05.814
We actually live in a relative world.

15:06.995 --> 15:12.432
Either we are thinking about the past or about the future.

15:12.994 --> 15:17.308
We are jumping on the cusp of this thoughts.

15:17.509 --> 15:21.954
But past is finished and future doesn't exist.

15:22.500 --> 15:26.557
We have to be in the present.

15:26.758 --> 15:30.938
And that is very difficult.

15:33.143 --> 15:35.178
When Kundalini rises

15:35.379 --> 15:42.167
She elongates those thoughts and our attention stands in the middle.

15:42.368 --> 15:46.966
And we become thoughtlessly aware.

15:47.167 --> 15:49.706
Means you are fully aware, but there's no thought

15:49.907 --> 15:54.441
from the future and the past.

15:54.762 --> 15:57.242
That is the time you grow spiritually

15:57.443 --> 16:01.821
and we get inspirations from the Divine.

16:02.239 --> 16:10.411
So we are in the present, which is the reality.

16:11.263 --> 16:17.615
And we know the reality, we become absolutely confident.

16:18.918 --> 16:23.194
Now the another thing that is very remarkable is that

16:23.395 --> 16:27.715
you know the absolute truth.

16:27.916 --> 16:32.322
That too on your fingertips.

16:33.137 --> 16:37.746
,Many people don't believe that there is God.

16:38.056 --> 16:43.501
Many people don't believe that Christ was the Son of God.

16:43.837 --> 16:47.379
But after enlightened, you just put your hands like this

16:47.580 --> 16:52.072
and ask the question: "Is there God?".

16:52.321 --> 16:57.672
And you feel a tremendous cool breeze flowing.

16:58.296 --> 17:02.572
Supposing there is a man false who comes and meets you,

17:02.773 --> 17:05.654
you just put your hands towards that person

17:05.855 --> 17:11.097
and you immediately will know what sort of a person he is.

17:11.390 --> 17:18.190
By recording the sensations on your central nervous system

17:18.430 --> 17:25.290
which is indicated on your fingertips, you can know everything.

17:27.132 --> 17:33.624
Such a person is blessed by the Divine Power.

17:34.918 --> 17:39.030
To such an extent that once they get Realization,

17:39.231 --> 17:44.673
they write letters to Me what miracles have happened to them.

17:46.070 --> 17:50.250
I've told somebody: "You better compile", and within one month,

17:50.474 --> 17:53.446
he telephoned to Me that: "They have come up over my head,

17:53.646 --> 17:57.701
I don't know what to select."

17:58.186 --> 18:01.689
When you become thoughtlessly aware,

18:01.890 --> 18:07.171
you become absolutely peaceful within yourself.

18:08.014 --> 18:12.259
I have seen people have got awards of peace,

18:12.460 --> 18:18.919
but what I know that they have no peace within themselves.

18:19.235 --> 18:26.274
And if you have to meet them, better take a barge pole.

18:27.032 --> 18:30.582
They are so hot-tempered.

18:30.790 --> 18:34.892
So egoistical and arrogant.

18:36.474 --> 18:42.107
How can you have peace if you have no peace within yourself?

18:42.692 --> 18:47.661
With Sahaja Yoga, it has been created

18:47.862 --> 18:55.111
a new race of extremely peaceful, loving, dynamic people.

18:55.343 --> 19:00.381
Sahaja Yoga is working in 65 nations.

19:00.997 --> 19:03.464
Of course in India is not difficult,

19:03.665 --> 19:08.793
but Russia has been a wonderful place for Sahaja Yoga.

19:09.168 --> 19:15.199
Russians are extremely sensitive to spirituality.

19:15.400 --> 19:20.790
At least 65 to 70%.

19:20.991 --> 19:27.616
The rest are materialistic, they want Malboro cigarette and all kinds of things.

19:27.817 --> 19:30.973
But they are all very well educated

19:31.174 --> 19:36.482
and this people has such a sense of spirituality.

19:37.032 --> 19:40.586
For example, Saint Petersburg University,

19:40.787 --> 19:44.370
which is one of the oldest universities,

19:44.571 --> 19:50.325
gave Me an award of Honorary Academician.

19:51.069 --> 19:56.881
And the tenth person to get it so far.

19:57.143 --> 20:01.791
And one of them is Einstein.

20:02.370 --> 20:05.341
And I was surprised, I asked them: "How do you put Me

20:05.542 --> 20:09.768
in the same line as Einstein?"

20:10.004 --> 20:13.530
So they said: "What Einstein has done is on the matter,"

20:13.731 --> 20:17.886
but You can work on human beings."

20:18.387 --> 20:24.403
In that conference there were two thousand great scientists.

20:25.162 --> 20:34.651
And they gave the subject of Medicine and Self-knowledge.

20:35.427 --> 20:40.621
But there were many others who spoke on morality and health.

20:40.822 --> 20:49.017
Morality has become a prime subject for these people.

20:49.708 --> 20:54.965
I was surprised scientist talking of morality.

20:55.166 --> 20:59.197
Because science is unmoral.

20:59.545 --> 21:08.099
And that is what they said that there is a gap with the science.

21:10.543 --> 21:16.499
I must tell you that I've been there only four times

21:16.700 --> 21:22.075
and in one place only, one place called Tolyatti,

21:22.276 --> 21:26.279
we have 21.000 Sahaja Yogis.

21:26.805 --> 21:30.406
There is a joke that they went once

21:30.607 --> 21:36.674
and one of the Toliatti Sahaja Yogi asked an American one:

21:36.875 --> 21:40.870
"How many Sahaja Yogis you have in America?"

21:41.283 --> 21:45.571
He said: "There are fifty-six."

21:45.960 --> 21:48.428
So a Toliatti Sahaja Yogi said: "Oh my God,

21:48.629 --> 21:54.710
"you have 56.000, we have 21.000 only in Toliatti."

21:56.028 --> 22:00.387
Because Americans lack maturity.

22:00.680 --> 22:03.975
They lack wisdom.

22:04.176 --> 22:08.350
They live like Hollywood actors and actresses,

22:08.551 --> 22:11.872
in the imaginary world.

22:14.016 --> 22:19.164
Like a one lady married eight times

22:19.365 --> 22:25.318
and ninth time she was going with a very young man for her honeymoon.

22:25.702 --> 22:33.311
And there were four, five thousand people just to see her going for her honeymoon.

22:33.956 --> 22:38.487
Not only that, but there were ten helicopters from where

22:38.688 --> 22:42.807
there were parachute down taking photographs

22:43.050 --> 22:48.385
They fell on people and some on trees.

22:48.933 --> 22:52.380
I must say India may be a poor country, but you won't get

22:52.581 --> 22:57.548
even one person to see such idiotic things.

22:58.214 --> 23:03.073
So Sahaja Yoga is not meant for idiots

23:03.274 --> 23:07.985
and for superficial people.

23:08.186 --> 23:12.592
It is of course not meant for arrogant.

23:12.922 --> 23:18.609
But it is meant for people who are true seekers of truth.

23:19.435 --> 23:23.013
In this seeking, people do go to wrong things.

23:23.214 --> 23:27.498
They have gone to false gurus, doesn't matter.

23:28.166 --> 23:33.205
You should know that we cannot pay for your enlightenment.

23:34.502 --> 23:37.908
God doesn't know money. He doesn't understand banking,

23:38.109 --> 23:42.017
that is our headache.

23:42.725 --> 23:46.335
So, if somebody ask money for your enlightenment,

23:46.536 --> 23:51.600
you better understand that he is a cheat.

23:52.245 --> 23:58.303
Also enlightenment doesn't mean some sort of a dressing up

23:58.504 --> 24:03.064
or shaving your hair.

24:03.806 --> 24:08.361
A great poet Kabira has said: "If by shaving your hair,

24:08.562 --> 24:10.562
if you are going to get your Nirvana,

24:10.763 --> 24:17.601
then the sheep who it is shaved every year will go there first."

24:19.390 --> 24:23.093
This time in Chicago, you will be surprised,

24:23.294 --> 24:28.669
I saw a Hare Rama fellow, the leader who came with a dot,

24:28.870 --> 24:33.209
that you wear, very light cloth.

24:33.885 --> 24:41.080
It was really very cold and as a Mother, I felt concern what is he after all.

24:41.776 --> 24:44.559
Then I asked him: "Why you are wearing a dot? It is so very cold,

24:44.760 --> 24:49.931
you will get troubles."

24:50.401 --> 24:53.401
So he said that "My guru has initiated

24:53.602 --> 24:58.924
and I am supposed to wear only dot, whether it is cold or not."

24:59.168 --> 25:04.894
And he said, "That is how it is I am going to get my Nirvana."

25:05.423 --> 25:09.259
I said, "In India, 80% people wear dots,

25:09.460 --> 25:14.475
if they are going to get Nirvana, then where you will be?"

25:15.398 --> 25:18.156
There is another really shocking thing.

25:18.357 --> 25:24.732
In Cabella, one fellow came and he told Me, that "I have become a very poor man,

25:24.933 --> 25:30.147
because all my money I have given to Dalai Lama."

25:30.452 --> 25:37.913
So in the name of God, how many types of people there are who are cheating,

25:38.395 --> 25:44.574
I have to tell you all these things because I am your Mother.

25:44.871 --> 25:48.621
I am not afraid of them.

25:48.822 --> 25:52.129
I am only afraid that you people are great seekers

25:52.330 --> 25:56.941
and you should not be lost.

25:57.538 --> 26:01.479
Guru Nanak has said, "The one who is a real master

26:01.680 --> 26:06.608
is the one who makes you meet the Divine."

26:06.809 --> 26:12.111
Christ also said that "You are to be born again."

26:12.312 --> 26:17.929
In Sanskrit, we have the word called "dwija" for a bird

26:18.130 --> 26:23.098
and also for an enlighten soul.

26:23.350 --> 26:30.427
That means a person who is born again like the bird.

26:31.143 --> 26:36.994
The bird is first an egg and then it becomes a bird,

26:37.195 --> 26:41.460
it has a second birth.

26:41.945 --> 26:45.530
In the same way, we have to have our second birth,

26:45.731 --> 26:49.858
where you get complete transformation.

26:51.468 --> 26:54.305
As it is, several people have that,

26:54.506 --> 26:59.271
"we are born again, we are Christians, Hindus, Muslims",

26:59.472 --> 27:03.534
these are nothing but brands.

27:04.001 --> 27:07.594
You maybe are a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anything,

27:07.795 --> 27:13.912
but you can commit any mistake and can commit any sin.

27:14.481 --> 27:19.777
In Sahaja Yoga, you become, becoming is the point.

27:20.171 --> 27:24.999
And when the Kundalini pierces through your fontanel bone area,

27:25.200 --> 27:29.887
is the actualization of your baptism, actualization.

27:30.088 --> 27:34.971
It is the experience of feeling the Divine.

27:35.708 --> 27:41.371
Is not a lecture or it is not a sermon.

27:43.108 --> 27:46.624
But the greatest thing that happens to you

27:46.825 --> 27:50.865
that you jump in the ocean of joy.

27:52.296 --> 27:58.655
Happiness and unhappiness are two sides of a coin.

28:00.470 --> 28:05.243
But joy is singular.

28:05.723 --> 28:10.684
Where you become the source of peace

28:10.885 --> 28:15.108
and you witness the whole world as a drama.

28:15.471 --> 28:22.127
But you yourself become the light of peace and joy.

28:23.111 --> 28:27.697
Sahaja Yoga is working in 55 nations now.

28:27.898 --> 28:32.718
And I am amazed that I've never seen anybody quarreling,

28:32.919 --> 28:37.145
fighting or even arguing.

28:37.868 --> 28:42.024
They all enjoy each others company.

28:42.286 --> 28:46.059
Such pure love, friendship

28:46.260 --> 28:50.471
that you really feel a new age has started.

28:50.672 --> 28:57.954
Very pure relationships of husband and wife, sisters, brothers,

28:58.155 --> 29:00.936
I've never heard somebody running away with somebody's wife

29:01.137 --> 29:05.543
or somebody's husband in Sahaja Yoga.

29:05.744 --> 29:13.923
I really know there are so many great
souls who want to be born on this Earth.

29:14.331 --> 29:22.701
And if they are born to non Sahaja Yogi, they will never understand their children.

29:23.632 --> 29:29.600
Moreover they are anxious to be born to Sahaja Yogis.

29:30.438 --> 29:37.446
In this lecture, I cannot tell you everything about Sahaja Yoga, I'm sorry.

29:38.151 --> 29:44.479
Only in English language, I must have addressed five thousand lectures so far.

29:45.325 --> 29:50.270
But it is like this, we have so many beautiful lights here.

29:50.894 --> 29:56.620
And we have to just put on one switch and all the lights come in.

29:57.681 --> 30:01.892
Because it is built in.

30:02.093 --> 30:06.234
In the same way, it is built in within you.

30:06.833 --> 30:11.035
This is your own power.

30:11.236 --> 30:15.431
This is your own glory.

30:16.157 --> 30:20.329
All your protection powers will manifest.

30:20.899 --> 30:27.641
So many artists, musicians have become world famous today.

30:28.280 --> 30:35.631
You will be happy to know this time, Miss Universe was a Sahaja Yogini.

30:36.426 --> 30:40.340
She is going to see Me and she said, "I don't want to wear funny dresses."

30:40.541 --> 30:44.431
I said, "No, you can wear, if you can wear swimming dresses,

30:44.632 --> 30:48.839
is alright, doesn't matter, you go ahead."

30:49.040 --> 30:54.000
She is a very simple, intelligent girl.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.337
I wouldn't say she is a beauty or anything

30:57.538 --> 31:01.907
according to Hollywood standards.

31:02.212 --> 31:08.517
But her innocence and her pose or her intelligence

31:08.718 --> 31:15.320
has achieved this wisdom for her that she is today Miss Universe.

31:15.835 --> 31:19.819
So is a very remarkable thing that we don't know

31:20.020 --> 31:26.582
what qualities we have, what potential we have, how dynamic people we are.

31:26.963 --> 31:31.231
It is like a candle which is not get enlightened

31:31.432 --> 31:38.034
but a enlightened candle can enlighten the one which is not enlightened.

31:39.183 --> 31:45.756
This is like is a seed, if it is embedded in the Mother Earth,

31:45.957 --> 31:50.792
it sprouts spontaneously, sahaja.

31:51.380 --> 31:54.633
Because the seed as well the Mother Earth

31:54.834 --> 31:59.177
has the built in quality to sprout.

31:59.519 --> 32:04.909
So believe Me, all of you have got this.

32:05.110 --> 32:09.245
And it will work out.

32:09.461 --> 32:13.843
Please have no doubts about yourself.

32:14.044 --> 32:19.719
Another thing is that this Power that is in the triangular bone

32:19.920 --> 32:24.623
is the Power of Pure Desire.

32:25.132 --> 32:29.420
All desires are not pure.

32:29.968 --> 32:33.813
You want to have house today, then you want to have a car,

32:34.014 --> 32:39.707
then want to have a helicopter, I don't know, goes on like that.

32:39.968 --> 32:43.197
There is no end.

32:43.456 --> 32:50.354
According to economics: wants are not satiable in general.

32:50.904 --> 32:59.458
Because they are not pure wants, pure desires.

32:59.811 --> 33:03.814
So you should have full confidence and also should have

33:04.015 --> 33:09.724
desire to be one with the Divine Power.

33:10.715 --> 33:15.778
I cannot force on you, you have to ask for it.

33:17.627 --> 33:21.751
Because I respect your freedom.

33:22.391 --> 33:27.101
This Power is your individual Mother.

33:27.711 --> 33:32.004
She knows everything about you.

33:32.205 --> 33:37.319
Like a tape recorder, She knows what are your desires,

33:37.520 --> 33:41.527
what are your aspirations.

33:42.470 --> 33:47.876
And She is very anxious to give you your second birth.

33:48.446 --> 33:53.668
And as when you were born, your mother took all the troubles,

33:53.869 --> 33:58.547
this Mother of yours takes all the trouble

33:58.748 --> 34:03.841
and you get your Self-Realization.

34:06.494 --> 34:10.783
It will hardly take fifteen minutes.

34:12.494 --> 34:16.805
But those who don't want to have it should leave the hall.

34:17.006 --> 34:20.711
Because they cannot get it also.

34:20.912 --> 34:24.982
On the contrary, they will disturb you.

34:25.282 --> 34:31.197
If you have faith in yourself, I'm sure it will work out.

34:31.398 --> 34:35.492
You have to respect yourself,

34:36.069 --> 34:42.092
Because you are a human being at epitome of evolution.

34:53.839 --> 34:56.460
Now as I told you

34:56.661 --> 35:02.380
that this Kundalini, your Mother, knows everything about you.

35:03.094 --> 35:07.656
Please do not judge yourself.

35:08.396 --> 35:12.951
She knows, She judges you.

35:13.427 --> 35:22.325
So first condition is that you should not feel guilty at all.

35:25.332 --> 35:30.035
Whatever has happen in the past has happen.

35:30.337 --> 35:38.938
Why carry the guilty on your left side, this center?

35:39.618 --> 35:46.438
As a result of this mythical behaviour, you get spondylitis,

35:46.639 --> 35:49.564
or you get angina,

35:49.765 --> 35:53.223
or you get lethargic organs.

35:53.489 --> 35:59.051
You might even get diseases like tuberculosis.

35:59.252 --> 36:04.042
So why to carry this myth of guilt?

36:06.326 --> 36:10.974
You have to really forgive yourself.

36:11.175 --> 36:15.698
And should be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

36:15.977 --> 36:19.894
Even in My lecture, if you think that I have said something

36:20.095 --> 36:24.337
that makes you feel guilty, forget it.

36:25.727 --> 36:30.347
The second condition is even simpler

36:30.548 --> 36:33.832
if you understand it.

36:34.033 --> 36:38.728
You have to forgive everyone

36:38.929 --> 36:42.694
even without thinking about them,

36:42.895 --> 36:47.522
because it is a headache to think about it.

36:47.723 --> 36:54.660
Now, logically whether you forgive or don't forgive, what do you do?

36:55.346 --> 36:58.396
You don't do anything.

36:58.597 --> 37:06.315
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself.

37:08.244 --> 37:13.345
All your life, you tortured yourself.

37:13.546 --> 37:18.096
But at this moment is important to get this center

37:18.297 --> 37:24.409
and the center in the optic chiasma opened out.

37:24.899 --> 37:31.094
If you feel guilty, this center won't open and the Kundalini won't pass through.

37:31.363 --> 37:38.854
But the worst is the center on the optic chiasma which is constricted like this.

37:39.293 --> 37:42.327
And it won't open unless and until

37:42.528 --> 37:47.528
you forgive everyone without thinking about them.

37:47.769 --> 37:53.787
As it is you are playing into wrong hands and by not forgiving

37:53.988 --> 38:00.332
you will miss the most important thing that is your enlightenment.

38:01.990 --> 38:10.872
Third condition is very simpler that I request you to get out your shoes

38:12.561 --> 38:15.951
I'm sorry I have to say that because in England, first time I said:

38:16.160 --> 38:21.485
"Please take out your shoes", half of them left the hall.

38:28.212 --> 38:33.352
This help us to be in contact with the Mother Earth,

38:34.154 --> 38:38.193
which help us a lot.

38:41.209 --> 38:48.201
Now, you don't say any prays, any mantras, nothing.

38:49.057 --> 38:53.283
Please don't try to concentrate.

38:53.688 --> 38:58.908
Kundalini Itself will take your attention upward.

38:59.469 --> 39:03.508
Alright.

39:09.985 --> 39:13.816
Those who are sitting on the ground are alright.

39:14.017 --> 39:17.090
But those who are sitting on the chair have to keep

39:17.291 --> 39:21.595
both their feet apart from each other.

39:22.933 --> 39:27.667
Please all of you do it, otherwise you can go.

39:33.985 --> 39:40.165
Because the left and right are two powers.

39:40.645 --> 39:46.559
The left one is the power of desire

39:47.533 --> 39:52.790
And the right one is the power of action.

39:54.080 --> 40:02.017
First we tell you how to nourish your center with your self-confidence.

40:02.218 --> 40:04.675
These exercises have to be done only for tonight,

40:04.876 --> 40:09.586
afterwards you don't have to do anything.

40:10.969 --> 40:13.672
Now, so please put your left hand towards Me

40:13.873 --> 40:18.694
like this on your lap very comfortably sitting.

40:18.895 --> 40:25.543
Why he is not doing himself there? What is the matter with you?

40:26.372 --> 40:31.067
If you don't want to do, you can go out.

40:34.034 --> 40:37.523
obstinate.

40:42.113 --> 40:48.960
Alright. Now please understand that

40:49.161 --> 40:52.547
you have to be comfortable in your chair,

40:52.748 --> 40:57.509
but not slouch, not put one foot on top of other,

40:57.710 --> 41:02.275
but comfortably sitting.

41:04.497 --> 41:08.693
You don't have to go to Himalayas and stand on your head.

41:08.981 --> 41:13.192
You don't have to give up anything.

41:13.738 --> 41:19.339
I have told you it is not outside, but inside something has to happen.

41:20.708 --> 41:24.109
So please put your left hand on your lap,

41:24.310 --> 41:32.435
which is symbolizing that you have a desire to have your Self-Realization.

41:33.478 --> 41:38.396
Now put your right hand on your heart.

41:39.075 --> 41:48.015
We use our right hand for nourishing our centers on the left hand side.

41:48.216 --> 41:52.212
In the heart resides the Spirit.

41:52.413 --> 41:54.413
Please put left hand towards Me, try to understand,

41:54.614 --> 42:00.092
left hand towards Me and right hand on your heart, please.

42:01.854 --> 42:09.400
Now, we put our hand on the heart, where resides the Spirit.

42:10.410 --> 42:14.788
Now we take our right hand to the upper portion of abdomen

42:14.989 --> 42:19.790
on the left hand side.

42:19.991 --> 42:27.140
I've told you that if you become the Spirit, you become your master.

42:27.341 --> 42:35.512
So this is the center of your mastery, which is created by prophets and seers.

42:36.355 --> 42:43.355
Now, we take our right hand to the lower portion of abdomen

42:43.556 --> 42:47.556
on the left hand side.

42:48.332 --> 42:56.605
This is the center, surprisingly, is of pure divine knowledge.

42:57.347 --> 43:03.503
Now we take it up again in the upper portion of your abdomen.

43:03.704 --> 43:08.770
Then we take it on our heart.

43:09.005 --> 43:11.453
Then in the corner of the neck and shoulder

43:11.654 --> 43:16.646
and turn our head to right.

43:17.575 --> 43:21.582
I've already told you about this center.

43:21.929 --> 43:24.132
And quite that is in today with you,

43:24.333 --> 43:29.061
please don't feel guilty at all.

43:29.262 --> 43:34.098
I tell you, you have done nothing wrong.

43:34.299 --> 43:37.011
After all you are human beings and only human beings

43:37.212 --> 43:41.533
can commit mistakes, you are not gods.

43:42.435 --> 43:49.036
In Sahaja Yoga, there's no confession and there's no guilty.

43:49.503 --> 43:54.277
Is only love, compassion and forgiveness.

43:55.002 --> 44:05.033
Now, raise your right hand on top of your forehead across and put down your head.

44:05.234 --> 44:13.859
Here you have to forgive everyone without thinking about them.

44:15.836 --> 44:20.199
Now without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

44:20.400 --> 44:24.830
just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness

44:25.031 --> 44:29.321
from the All-Pervading Divine Power.

44:30.340 --> 44:34.312
So take back your right hand on the back side of your head.

44:34.513 --> 44:38.732
This is the center for asking forgiveness.

44:39.172 --> 44:44.438
Now the last center, you have to stretch your palm fully.

44:44.723 --> 44:50.195
And put the center of your palm on top of fontanel bone area,

44:50.396 --> 44:57.132
which is a soft bone (...) your scalp.

44:57.590 --> 45:01.663
Now please, put down your head.

45:01.864 --> 45:05.919
And move your scalp seven times slowly.

45:06.364 --> 45:10.539
That is all you have to do.

45:10.740 --> 45:14.771
Now you have to close your eyes.

45:16.571 --> 45:20.965
Before that, see that you put your both the feet apart from each other

45:21.165 --> 45:25.321
and your left hand on your lap.

45:34.980 --> 45:46.753
Now, please close your eyes and don't open them till I tell you.

45:50.832 --> 45:54.870
Take down your hands now.

45:57.410 --> 46:01.441
And now put your right hand on your heart.

46:08.252 --> 46:11.036
Close your eyes.

46:11.236 --> 46:16.244
Now, here your have to ask Me a very fundamental question

46:16.445 --> 46:20.290
about yourself.

46:29.423 --> 46:34.860
You can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji.

46:37.844 --> 46:42.566
So please say three times, ask a question:

46:42.766 --> 46:46.876
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

47:01.108 --> 47:05.947
I have told already to you that if you become the Spirit,

47:06.147 --> 47:11.108
you become your own master.

47:16.767 --> 47:21.161
So please take your right hand upper portion of you abdomen

47:21.361 --> 47:24.846
on the left hand side.

47:28.517 --> 47:33.849
And here, you have to ask another fundamental question

47:34.049 --> 47:38.048
about yourself three times.

47:43.577 --> 47:46.471
Please ask Me in your heart three times:

47:46.671 --> 47:51.690
"Mother, am I my own master?"

48:00.250 --> 48:03.484
Now,

48:06.852 --> 48:13.305
I have already told you that I respect your freedom.

48:16.565 --> 48:24.385
And I cannot force on you the Pure Divine Knowledge.

48:28.685 --> 48:32.290
You have to ask for it.

48:32.490 --> 48:38.818
So please put down your hand in the left hand side of your abdomen,

48:44.535 --> 48:48.117
in the lower region.

48:48.317 --> 48:55.629
Here you ask again six times because this center has got six petals.

49:00.687 --> 49:08.820
Here you have to ask: "Mother, please give me Pure Divine Knowledge."

49:19.801 --> 49:25.765
Now, as soon as you ask for Pure Divine Knowledge,

49:25.965 --> 49:30.707
your Kundalini starts moving upward.

49:37.266 --> 49:44.382
So we have to nourish upper centers with your self-confidence.

49:49.557 --> 49:52.958
Please now put your right hand the upper portion of your abdomen

49:53.159 --> 49:57.210
on the left hand side.

50:02.229 --> 50:10.261
Here you have to say ten times with your full self-confidence:

50:10.462 --> 50:14.876
"Mother, I am my own master."

50:32.174 --> 50:37.748
At very outset, I told you that you are not this body, this mind,

50:37.948 --> 50:43.654
this intellect, these emotions, your ego or your conditionings,

50:43.854 --> 50:48.292
but you are the pure Spirit.

50:58.878 --> 51:02.482
So now please raise your hand on your heart

51:02.682 --> 51:07.785
and say again with full self-confidence twelve times:

51:07.986 --> 51:12.487
"Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

51:23.142 --> 51:29.653
This All-Pervading Divine Power is the ocean of knowledge

51:29.853 --> 51:33.783
of bliss.

51:42.025 --> 51:47.244
Ocean of bliss.

51:48.439 --> 51:56.517
It is the ocean of compassion and love.

51:59.540 --> 52:06.009
But above all, It is the ocean of forgiveness.

52:08.579 --> 52:11.864
So whatever mistakes your might have committed

52:12.064 --> 52:19.392
can be easily dissolved in the power of this ocean of forgiveness.

52:26.703 --> 52:31.683
So please, forgive yourself.

52:31.883 --> 52:36.151
And put your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder

52:36.351 --> 52:40.336
and push your neck to your right.

52:47.989 --> 52:54.047
Here you have to say, again, with full self-confidence sixteen times:

52:54.247 --> 52:59.319
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

53:14.922 --> 53:23.562
I have already told you that you have to forgive everyone.

53:27.288 --> 53:34.124
Logically, whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything.

53:39.096 --> 53:45.252
But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

53:48.946 --> 53:58.360
So it is very important to forgive everyone without thinking about them.

54:04.743 --> 54:09.236
Leave them to the Divine Power to deal.

54:12.556 --> 54:21.962
Then you all raise your hand on top of your forehead across and please put down your head.

54:27.049 --> 54:35.744
Here you have to say from your heart not how many times:

54:41.898 --> 54:47.812
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

54:51.511 --> 54:54.647
At this moment, if you don't forgive,

54:54.847 --> 54:58.897
then this center which is so constricted won't open

54:59.097 --> 55:03.307
and the Kundalini cannot pass through it.

55:12.796 --> 55:17.878
Now without feeling guilty, without pointing your mistakes,

55:18.078 --> 55:23.042
for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness

55:23.242 --> 55:27.476
from the All-Pervading Divine Power.

55:35.976 --> 55:39.190
So please take your right hand back side of your head

55:39.390 --> 55:43.780
and push back your head as far as possible.

55:49.752 --> 55:55.758
Here you have to say, again, from your heart, not how many times:

55:55.958 --> 56:03.071
"Oh, Divine Power, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong

56:03.271 --> 56:07.308
knowingly or unknowingly.

56:24.627 --> 56:30.447
Now the last center, which is very important.

56:33.919 --> 56:39.022
You have to stretch your hand fully, the palm fully

56:39.223 --> 56:47.774
and put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area,

56:47.974 --> 56:53.037
it was a soft bone in your childhood.

57:04.629 --> 57:08.769
Now please put down your head.

57:10.574 --> 57:15.363
Please stretch your fingers outward.

57:17.433 --> 57:24.499
Here again I cannot force enlightenment on you,

57:24.699 --> 57:28.965
you have to ask for it.

57:34.410 --> 57:39.311
So now move your scalp seven times slowly clockwise,

57:39.511 --> 57:46.965
saying seven times: "Mother, please give me my Self-Realization."

58:31.164 --> 58:35.375
Now please take down your hands.

58:37.023 --> 58:42.203
And open your eyes slowly.

58:43.227 --> 58:47.516
Put both the hands towards Me like this.

58:50.321 --> 58:54.633
And watch Me without thinking.

59:02.564 --> 59:08.728
Now please put your right hand towards Me like this.

59:11.671 --> 59:15.650
And put down your head.

59:15.850 --> 59:23.096
See with the left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze like vibrations

59:23.296 --> 59:29.366
coming from your fontanel bone area

59:37.509 --> 59:40.497
Please bend your head.

59:40.697 --> 59:47.197
And don't put your hand on top of the head, but away from it, near it.

59:53.276 --> 59:59.424
Now please turn, put the left hand towards Me like this.

01:00:02.446 --> 01:00:07.829
Again bend your head and see with the right hand,

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:15.332
if there is a hot or a cool breeze like vibrations

01:00:15.532 --> 01:00:20.368
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:00:27.446 --> 01:00:31.602
Some people get it further.

01:00:34.509 --> 01:00:40.641
But if it is hot, then you have not forgiven yourself

01:00:40.841 --> 01:00:45.534
or your have not forgiven others, so please do that now.

01:00:53.388 --> 01:00:57.693
Now again, lastly, put your right hand towards Me

01:00:57.894 --> 01:01:02.071
and try to feel if there is any cool or hot breeze

01:01:02.272 --> 01:01:06.370
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:01:23.791 --> 01:01:29.635
Now do not doubt you, is coming from your own head.

01:01:36.555 --> 01:01:40.578
Bend your heads, bend your heads.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:47.690
Now, raise your both the hands towards the sky like this

01:01:47.891 --> 01:01:51.969
and push back your head.

01:01:58.964 --> 01:02:05.554
Here you have to ask a question three times

01:02:05.754 --> 01:02:09.784
anyone of these three questions.

01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:17.882
Please ask, first question:

01:02:18.082 --> 01:02:22.714
"Mother, this is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:02:29.637 --> 01:02:38.411
Second question: "Mother, is this the All-Pervading Power of Divine Love, the Ruh?

01:02:44.241 --> 01:02:49.436
Or "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?"

01:02:51.483 --> 01:02:59.304
Ask anyone of these three questions, anyone three times.

01:03:03.685 --> 01:03:08.154
Now take down your hands.

01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:23.401
All those who have felt cool breeze on their fingertips

01:03:23.601 --> 01:03:29.237
or on their palm or out of their fontanel bone area,

01:03:29.437 --> 01:03:34.655
even maybe hot, please raise both your hands.

01:03:48.626 --> 01:03:52.887
Brazil! I bow to you all the saints of Brazil.

01:03:53.087 --> 01:03:57.220
May God bless you all. May God bless you.

01:04:04.104 --> 01:04:08.448
Specially Brasilia.

01:04:08.648 --> 01:04:12.711
May God bless you.

01:04:28.607 --> 01:04:33.654
Please, one thing I have to tell you clearly,

01:04:36.717 --> 01:04:42.545
that whatever has happen to you is a collective happening.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:50.261
You can only grow collectively,

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:58.214
not in your homes, but you have to come to the collective.

01:05:01.925 --> 01:05:06.292
You don't have to pay for anything.

01:05:08.378 --> 01:05:11.389
As you know that we don't take any money,

01:05:11.589 --> 01:05:17.487
we don't have elaborate places, we are humble.

01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:32.391
So please make it a point to respect your Self-Realization.

01:05:37.541 --> 01:05:46.294
You don't have to pay, but you have to respect your Self-Realization

01:05:46.494 --> 01:05:50.633
and give little time to it.

01:05:57.976 --> 01:06:04.015
If you have any problems, they can be solved in the collective.

01:06:07.377 --> 01:06:11.411
Also they will tell you all about how to meditate,

01:06:11.611 --> 01:06:15.627
hardly for ten minutes everyday.

01:06:20.471 --> 01:06:25.200
Gradually you will come to know everything and within one month time,

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:29.182
you can become a master of Sahaja Yoga.

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:39.508
You will have powers to raise the Kundalini of others.

01:06:42.119 --> 01:06:46.267
You will have powers to cure others.

01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:55.721
There are so many powers of love and compassion and dynamism,

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:05.680
that you will get the answer which science cannot give you,

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:10.482
why are you on this Earth?

01:07:16.575 --> 01:07:21.071
Firstly you enter into the Kingdom of God

01:07:21.271 --> 01:07:27.349
and secondly to be the channel of this All-Pervading Power.

01:07:34.639 --> 01:07:39.595
This is for your benevolence, for the benevolence of your family,

01:07:39.795 --> 01:07:46.896
for the benevolence of your country and for the benevolence of the whole world.

01:07:53.581 --> 01:07:58.113
Thus we can create a very peaceful world.

01:08:01.191 --> 01:08:05.800
And this is the Truth you have been seeking.

01:08:09.339 --> 01:08:13.194
May God bless you all.

01:08:13.394 --> 01:08:17.996
Thank you very much.
