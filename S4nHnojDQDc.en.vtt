00:09:57.667 --> 00:10:03.648
It's a very great day for Me to
see so many Sahaja Yogis here

00:10:04.042 --> 00:10:10.899
who are from this
country, Greece.

00:10:12.643 --> 00:10:16.218
When first I came
to Greece,

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:21.174
I told My husband that this
country is full of vibrations

00:10:21.455 --> 00:10:27.061
and there have been many
evolved souls in this country

00:10:27.574 --> 00:10:31.088
but perhaps the people
have lost their heritage,

00:10:31.475 --> 00:10:34.507
but the vibrations are
in the atmosphere

00:10:34.957 --> 00:10:39.790
and one day Sahaja Yoga
should prosper here very much.

00:10:40.584 --> 00:10:48.291
And somehow, we met some
bureaucrats who were Greeks and

00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:53.165
the experience was not good with
them and My husband said

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.266
that, "If you said that Greeks
are really religious people,

00:10:57.527 --> 00:11:00.483
then look at these people
- what are they doing to me?"

00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:04.327
I said, "They may be bureaucrats
and all over, bureaucrats,

00:11:04.596 --> 00:11:06.717
you can't say what sort
of people they could be."

00:11:06.964 --> 00:11:13.282
But, on the whole, the vibrations
were very, very good, no doubt,

00:11:13.607 --> 00:11:19.480
and I went to all the places
in here, like I went to Delphi,

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.649
I went up there to see Athena's
temple and everything.

00:11:23.986 --> 00:11:29.579
To all the places of interest,
they took Me round, especially Me,

00:11:32.235 --> 00:11:35.385
because he was busy
with his conference,

00:11:35.659 --> 00:11:39.553
and so they took Me round.
And everywhere I felt

00:11:39.853 --> 00:11:44.372
even the sea I felt was
so beautiful. This was about,

00:11:44.665 --> 00:11:49.598
I think I came here at least
about fifteen years back,

00:11:49.867 --> 00:11:55.167
maybe fourteen years
back - and I find now

00:11:56.211 --> 00:11:59.672
the vibrations are coming
back now through you people

00:12:00.097 --> 00:12:03.378
and the whole place
is again vibrating.

00:12:03.665 --> 00:12:05.489
Now, you have to understand
that you people

00:12:05.821 --> 00:12:09.089
have a very big responsibility
because you're

00:12:09.339 --> 00:12:13.570
strategically placed
in Greece, you see.

00:12:13.882 --> 00:12:19.720
Creece and Italy, I mean Turkey,
both are very important.

00:12:20.439 --> 00:12:24.511
First of all, you are the bridge
between the eastern side

00:12:24.774 --> 00:12:29.686
and the western side and
everybody is interested in,

00:12:30.061 --> 00:12:33.333
somehow or another,
managing these two areas

00:12:33.627 --> 00:12:38.946
so that hey could control
eastern and western side.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.365
I mean the western
countries especially.

00:12:44.633 --> 00:12:47.252
Now the greatest danger
that you have now

00:12:47.534 --> 00:12:51.715
is that this western culture
may try to grab you

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.175
and which is very
dangerous.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.638
To understand it,
you have to know

00:12:59.944 --> 00:13:03.738
that you are people coming
from a very great tradition,

00:13:04.082 --> 00:13:08.427
ancient people of ages
just like Indians,

00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:15.720
and there is so much you can do
to improve the culture of Europe

00:13:16.063 --> 00:13:19.001
by your own behavior.

00:13:19.289 --> 00:13:23.568
Like these people we have
coming here, tourists are coming,

00:13:24.062 --> 00:13:30.168
and they see the
behavior of the Greeks

00:13:30.718 --> 00:13:36.017
and they see that they
can influence very well,

00:13:37.555 --> 00:13:43.849
the Europeans, think that Greeks
can be very easily influenced

00:13:44.093 --> 00:13:48.061
by their culture,
by their cheap life.

00:13:48.798 --> 00:13:53.648
So, as you being the
such traditional people,

00:13:53.942 --> 00:13:59.217
down to earth and
so many, so many

00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:04.365
good things you
have known in life,

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:08.878
it's very important to
understand the historical

00:14:09.185 --> 00:14:11.768
background of your country,
first of all.

00:14:12.043 --> 00:14:17.129
For Sahaja Yogis it is very
important to be educated that way

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.279
because tomorrow you'll have
to talk to other people

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:25.748
and you'll have to tell them
about Athena, about your traditions,

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:30.686
about your background and how
it is connected to Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:30.973 --> 00:14:35.153
connected to Mother Mary, connected
to Christ and all those things.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.564
For this, it is very necessary that
we all should try to understand

00:14:40.864 --> 00:14:43.594
the historical background
of this country

00:14:44.154 --> 00:14:50.085
and educate yourself in a way that
you can talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:50.847 --> 00:14:54.165
As it is, you know, Athena has
the Kundalini in Her hand

00:14:54.497 --> 00:14:59.161
and you can see that clearly
that She was the Adi Shakti.

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:03.165
Actually, in Sanskrit language
atha means primordial.

00:15:03.434 --> 00:15:05.965
So She was
the Primordial Mother.

00:15:06.514 --> 00:15:07.918
Because there was
no connection

00:15:08.187 --> 00:15:10.849
left between the Greeks
and the Indians,

00:15:11.126 --> 00:15:14.495
this, I mean, translation

00:15:14.782 --> 00:15:19.489
was not there and they didn't
know what it meant by Athena.

00:15:20.563 --> 00:15:23.819
But Indians know that it
is this is the place

00:15:24.125 --> 00:15:29.717
for the manifestation
of the Adi Shakti

00:15:30.118 --> 00:15:34.683
because in the Devi Mahatmyam,
if you read, or you will find out

00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:38.648
they have described Greece
as the Manipurndwip.

00:15:38.973 --> 00:15:45.523
Means the island in the Manipur.
Manipur is this Nabhi Chakra.

00:15:45.873 --> 00:15:52.497
So in the Nabhi there's an
island where it is your Greece,

00:15:52.833 --> 00:15:57.125
where the Goddess resides.
Manipur chakra is where She resides.

00:15:58.414 --> 00:16:02.551
And so, this Athena has
been described,

00:16:02.789 --> 00:16:06.902
and when I went to Her
temple I found that there was

00:16:07.196 --> 00:16:13.274
a little temple for the child God.
That was Shri Ganesha.

00:16:13.552 --> 00:16:17.014
And then, when I went to Delphi,
also, when I went there

00:16:17.295 --> 00:16:20.321
I was surprised to see, they showed
Me a mound and said,

00:16:20.608 --> 00:16:24.252
"This is the Nabhi, navel
of the whole universe."

00:16:24.515 --> 00:16:27.502
I said, "That's correct." But when
I turned round there

00:16:27.777 --> 00:16:32.182
were lots of vibrations and what
I find is a Ganesha statue there.

00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:35.039
Then Gregoire came here
he took photographs

00:16:35.339 --> 00:16:37.439
and everything
and he saw that.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.221
So now you are the Nabhi.
You are sitting here in the Nabhi

00:16:41.496 --> 00:16:44.558
of the whole universe.
So how important is Nabhi?

00:16:44.877 --> 00:16:49.613
You know that very well,
that Nabhi Chakra gets spoilt,

00:16:49.881 --> 00:16:53.800
the whole life becomes
miserable for a human being.

00:16:54.088 --> 00:16:57.600
So, on the right side of
the Nabhi, as you see,

00:16:58.425 --> 00:17:04.900
is the liver and because, of course,
we had lots of philosophers,

00:17:05.212 --> 00:17:09.824
they used to think a lot and
they created lots of tragedies,

00:17:10.093 --> 00:17:13.990
you see Greek tragedy's well
known, where a marriage system was

00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:19.365
little bit challenged, that
there was, say, two men,

00:17:19.658 --> 00:17:23.053
one woman or maybe
two women, one man

00:17:23.316 --> 00:17:26.535
and never they felt happy
with the marriage.

00:17:26.841 --> 00:17:30.751
So the left Nabhi was
under attack, throughout.

00:17:31.045 --> 00:17:36.048
To have such a tragedy, they
wrote so many, I would say,

00:17:36.373 --> 00:17:41.880
so many dramas and they played them
here and so many plays were there

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.199
showing that there are two
men and one woman

00:17:45.506 --> 00:17:49.506
or two women and one
man and no relationship

00:17:49.811 --> 00:17:53.066
between the husband
and wife which was pure.

00:17:53.349 --> 00:17:54.702
And that was the tragedy.

00:17:54.964 --> 00:17:57.939
It's known all over
as the Greek tragedy.

00:17:58.202 --> 00:18:00.633
It's all imaginary
and people, you see,

00:18:00.908 --> 00:18:04.139
became very left-sided to
begin with. They started thinking,

00:18:04.395 --> 00:18:07.615
Oh, this life is a misery.
It's a tragedy.

00:18:07.859 --> 00:18:11.396
What should we do?
Why should we?

00:18:11.821 --> 00:18:16.621
Why should we try to
show that we are happy?

00:18:16.896 --> 00:18:18.634
We are very
unhappy people.

00:18:18.902 --> 00:18:22.077
And all these things
started here to begin with.

00:18:22.377 --> 00:18:25.514
Then came these
your Orthodox Church.

00:18:25.814 --> 00:18:29.045
Now this Orthodox Church is
another one, which, of course,

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.338
is really doesn't treat women
very well and treats them

00:18:33.601 --> 00:18:39.007
as if they are all the
time unholy. Certain times

00:18:39.276 --> 00:18:42.738
they cannot go to church
and they cannot touch people,

00:18:43.007 --> 00:18:45.850
all kinds of nonsensical
ideas they had.

00:18:46.206 --> 00:18:49.288
That also made women
very left-sided.

00:18:49.613 --> 00:18:52.307
Then, on top of that,
all this was happening

00:18:52.589 --> 00:18:54.563
with these tragedies
and all that.

00:18:54.976 --> 00:19:01.540
Suddenly the economic problem
came up and people felt very,

00:19:01.827 --> 00:19:04.941
sort of, disgusted
about that.

00:19:05.262 --> 00:19:07.394
So the left side
became very,

00:19:07.712 --> 00:19:11.194
very prominent here
and that is how I think

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:13.791
many of these left-sided,

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.979
bhootish organizations
started here

00:19:18.566 --> 00:19:22.504
and many gurus came who
made you feel miserable.

00:19:22.829 --> 00:19:25.378
But the worst that was
done by the Greek Church

00:19:25.728 --> 00:19:28.242
which made you feel so guilty.

00:19:28.548 --> 00:19:31.592
So you became
very left-sided.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:35.974
Now this left-sidedness was
later on counter-balanced

00:19:36.249 --> 00:19:38.727
by people who started
becoming overactive;

00:19:38.996 --> 00:19:42.952
thinking too much, working too
hard and all those things.

00:19:43.296 --> 00:19:46.633
But still, I think that they don't
work very hard as they should work.

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:49.327
They're on the lazy side,
the Greeks are.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.386
They're on the lazy side. Of course,
the Sahaja Yogis are not.

00:19:52.642 --> 00:19:54.108
The Sahaja Yogis have
worked very hard,

00:19:54.414 --> 00:19:57.425
I can see all that very
clearly, but otherwise.

00:19:57.744 --> 00:20:03.833
So, now to bring
out Sahaja Yoga

00:20:04.195 --> 00:20:07.456
in Greece, is important,
first of all, to know

00:20:07.712 --> 00:20:11.244
what is our historical
background.

00:20:11.507 --> 00:20:13.957
The second, they should
be very well equipped

00:20:14.187 --> 00:20:17.381
with the knowledge
of chakras and centers

00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:23.771
and how to improve these centers.
If you do not have that knowledge,

00:20:24.021 --> 00:20:26.913
you cannot face people. It's not
that only men should know,

00:20:27.176 --> 00:20:29.828
women also should
know everything about it.

00:20:30.084 --> 00:20:33.716
What is the chakras are,
how they work out

00:20:35.303 --> 00:20:40.400
and what are their results
are, how do we suffer

00:20:40.668 --> 00:20:42.880
because our chakras
are in danger.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:45.817
All this knowledge
is free to you.

00:20:46.283 --> 00:20:49.059
You don't have to pay for
this knowledge. Only thing,

00:20:49.321 --> 00:20:52.920
every day-to-day life, when you
start working out Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:58.639
then you'll find that what I'm
saying is absolutely tangible.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:03.961
You can verify it. It is so.
It's not something in the air.

00:21:04.204 --> 00:21:07.780
It is absolutely there.
We can prove everything

00:21:08.025 --> 00:21:11.678
that we believe in and we
can show others also

00:21:11.946 --> 00:21:15.584
that this is the truth.
Is an absolute truth.

00:21:15.884 --> 00:21:18.077
We are not here to
spread some sort

00:21:18.365 --> 00:21:21.941
of a fanaticism or racialism
or anything like that,

00:21:22.227 --> 00:21:25.215
but we are here to combine
the whole world together

00:21:25.515 --> 00:21:29.810
under one understanding; that
we belong to one universe

00:21:30.091 --> 00:21:33.879
and we have one
universal religion.

00:21:34.322 --> 00:21:35.753
Now, people will ask
you then,

00:21:36.034 --> 00:21:38.453
"Have we to give up
your religion?"

00:21:38.716 --> 00:21:40.141
You don't have to tell them that
you have to give up your religion,

00:21:40.391 --> 00:21:43.174
don't have to say that. You don't
have to be hard with them at all.

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.586
On the contrary, no, no, no,
nothing has to be done.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:50.449
You just come and take to Sahaja
Yoga and take to your spirit.

00:21:50.736 --> 00:21:54.331
Gradually it will start
opening out.

00:21:54.762 --> 00:21:56.531
It has happened with
all of you

00:21:56.787 --> 00:21:58.537
that first when you
came to Sahaja Yoga

00:21:58.831 --> 00:22:01.572
you were in a different
shape. Now gradually,

00:22:01.884 --> 00:22:03.478
you started opening
out, you matured

00:22:03.766 --> 00:22:06.465
and you understood
Sahaja Yoga very well.

00:22:06.746 --> 00:22:11.538
In the same way, you must
teach others in the same manner,

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:16.647
with the same understanding,
compassion and love.

00:22:16.897 --> 00:22:20.053
Otherwise, normally people
think that somebody

00:22:20.353 --> 00:22:22.664
is to be condemned
all the time.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:27.061
Of course, some are people
who are under bad influence

00:22:27.348 --> 00:22:31.122
and you cannot get along
with them, but most of you

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:35.604
should know that we have to get
more people into Sahaja Yoga

00:22:35.885 --> 00:22:42.135
through our compassion, love
and also lot of understanding

00:22:42.403 --> 00:22:48.665
about others' feelings. I've
found that even countries

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.809
where have been Sahaja
Yoga for so many time,

00:22:52.115 --> 00:22:57.275
suddenly someone comes up
and starts giving trouble

00:22:57.575 --> 00:23:02.569
and becoming bhootish sort of
thing, you see, and misbehaving.

00:23:02.894 --> 00:23:06.931
Suddenly, it happens. Such a person,
you know, if it is informed,

00:23:07.187 --> 00:23:09.993
we can take him out of Sahaja
Yoga. We can cleanse him.

00:23:10.299 --> 00:23:12.979
But all of you must know
one thing for definite

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:16.685
that you all have these
powers to cure yourself,

00:23:16.966 --> 00:23:19.185
improve yourself,
to help others.

00:23:19.466 --> 00:23:21.701
You can do everything
yourself.

00:23:22.008 --> 00:23:24.711
You all have these powers,
but the only thing

00:23:24.979 --> 00:23:27.029
is you have to be
sincere and honest.

00:23:27.361 --> 00:23:31.142
If you are not sincere and
honest, it will never work out.

00:23:31.467 --> 00:23:34.473
On the contrary, it will
boomerang on you.

00:23:34.773 --> 00:23:39.889
So, in Sahaja Yoga, it's very impor-
tant is the sincerity of purpose.

00:23:40.251 --> 00:23:42.951
You must have complete
sincerity of purpose

00:23:43.219 --> 00:23:48.473
that you are here to achieve your
own self-emancipation, first.

00:23:48.787 --> 00:23:55.936
And secondly, you are
here to help others.

00:23:57.155 --> 00:24:01.886
The people all along in the
whole world now require help.

00:24:02.193 --> 00:24:05.955
There's so many problems,
so many catastrophes,

00:24:06.299 --> 00:24:12.792
so many horrible things
we everyday know going on.

00:24:13.042 --> 00:24:15.660
So now we need people who
are solid, who are balanced,

00:24:15.923 --> 00:24:19.923
who are peaceful, who understand
what is right and what is wrong.

00:24:20.623 --> 00:24:22.243
But apart from that,
you should know

00:24:22.476 --> 00:24:26.130
that you have now entered
into the Kingdom of God.

00:24:26.368 --> 00:24:28.924
Many people will say, all right,
we were so religious,

00:24:29.157 --> 00:24:31.157
we were praying to Christ,
we were praying to this one,

00:24:31.384 --> 00:24:34.066
praying to that one.
What did we get?

00:24:34.333 --> 00:24:36.935
You cannot get it because
you are not connected.

00:24:37.191 --> 00:24:40.571
You have to be connected. Once
you are connected to that,

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.570
then you will find that
things start sorting out.

00:24:44.859 --> 00:24:48.513
But sincerity is very important
and faith in yourself.

00:24:48.922 --> 00:24:52.745
You must have faith in yourself
that you're quite capable,

00:24:52.973 --> 00:24:57.268
quite capable person and
you can achieve

00:24:57.829 --> 00:25:02.074
a very high degree of awareness by
which you can work out many things.

00:25:02.307 --> 00:25:05.500
It doesn't matter from what sort
of background you come in.

00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:08.095
It doesn't matter from what sort
of country you come in,

00:25:08.351 --> 00:25:09.573
race anything.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.288
You all can do very well

00:25:11.533 --> 00:25:16.520
and we have seen this happening in
so many countries where we had

00:25:16.751 --> 00:25:23.606
no hope at all. For example,
a country like Russia,

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:28.005
imagine, they've never
worshipped any God.

00:25:28.238 --> 00:25:31.266
They didn't know about God.
They were not allowed to know

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:33.766
about any religion,
anything,

00:25:34.053 --> 00:25:37.885
but suddenly I went there, I don't
know, they recognized Me, suddenly.

00:25:38.266 --> 00:25:41.309
They just recognized Me and
just with My photograph

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.858
I find them there. I was
amazed that the first time

00:25:44.158 --> 00:25:52.839
I went to Leningrad there were
two thousand seats in the hall,

00:25:53.202 --> 00:25:55.359
but outside they were
all standing. I said,

00:25:55.652 --> 00:25:57.283
"Why are they standing
outside?" They said,

00:25:57.558 --> 00:25:59.920
"All the seats are full, Mother,
and these are extra people.

00:26:00.265 --> 00:26:03.556
There are more than two
thousand outside." So I said,

00:26:03.875 --> 00:26:07.194
"This is too much." And so they
said, "Mother, what about us?"

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.325
I said, "All right, let me
finish the program."

00:26:09.619 --> 00:26:12.258
I went inside, did the program,
everything happened

00:26:12.634 --> 00:26:13.684
and you'll be amazed

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.406
when we had the program,
the people who were outside

00:26:17.703 --> 00:26:20.662
were still waiting. I gave
realization to people

00:26:20.925 --> 00:26:22.768
and they were waiting,
waiting, waiting.

00:26:23.037 --> 00:26:25.612
When I came out
I gave them.

00:26:26.318 --> 00:26:27.735
I said, "Now, what to do?

00:26:28.011 --> 00:26:30.148
I can't give you
realization just now."

00:26:30.429 --> 00:26:32.586
So they said, "All right,
what can we do?"

00:26:32.898 --> 00:26:34.769
I said, "Tomorrow morning
can you come?" They said,

00:26:35.069 --> 00:26:38.267
"All right." So all those who were
inside and those who were outside,

00:26:38.517 --> 00:26:41.470
all of them came and
came and sat down

00:26:41.757 --> 00:26:46.722
and that open ground and
I gave them realization.

00:26:47.003 --> 00:26:50.097
So this is the first beginning,
but now in Moscow

00:26:50.378 --> 00:26:56.124
or any place we have to
reserve a huge, big stadium.

00:26:56.487 --> 00:26:59.343
Fourteen to sixteen
thousand people are there

00:26:59.606 --> 00:27:03.268
and realization is
being given.

00:27:03.699 --> 00:27:06.286
But they are so quick
to accept Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:06.555 --> 00:27:10.979
so quick to accept Me, so quick
to understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:11.273 --> 00:27:16.495
I just can't imagine how these
Russians have got this capacity.

00:27:18.278 --> 00:27:20.022
No question of their
going back,

00:27:20.328 --> 00:27:22.678
no question of their
sincerity being challenged.

00:27:22.966 --> 00:27:28.798
There is no question of their
doubting themselves, nothing.

00:27:29.173 --> 00:27:33.648
Just there and so much so,
so much that I sometimes feel

00:27:33.967 --> 00:27:36.429
this democracy has
just harmed us.

00:27:36.898 --> 00:27:39.861
Because of democracy,of course,
we could do Sahaja Yoga all right,

00:27:40.148 --> 00:27:45.131
but where the people are,
absolutely sometimes very idiotic.

00:27:45.469 --> 00:27:48.943
Like in America, I find there's
very idiotic people live there

00:27:49.206 --> 00:27:53.768
and they were only busy
choosing their bathrooms

00:27:54.087 --> 00:27:58.343
and their curtains and their soaps
and all the time they will choose,

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.086
only busy with all these
nonsensical things.

00:28:01.367 --> 00:28:08.004
They are so idiotic, while the
people in Russia are so sensible,

00:28:08.292 --> 00:28:15.075
so deep, so introspective and
even the artists and the scientists.

00:28:16.375 --> 00:28:20.849
I had a conference with the scientists.
There were about three hundred of them

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:23.274
and I started talking to
them about science.

00:28:23.531 --> 00:28:24.781
I thought, better start
with science.

00:28:25.068 --> 00:28:26.699
They said, "Mother, no more
science, no more science.

00:28:26.999 --> 00:28:30.761
Tell us the science
of God."

00:28:32.393 --> 00:28:33.893
Such open-minded people.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.018
We have two hundred
doctors in Russia

00:28:37.311 --> 00:28:42.299
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga
and it has spread up to Siberia.

00:28:45.748 --> 00:28:47.777
Now, what's the use
of this democracy

00:28:48.033 --> 00:28:51.213
which doesn't take us to God.
It doesn't give us sense

00:28:51.482 --> 00:28:55.270
that we should seek God and
we should be humble towards God.

00:28:55.576 --> 00:28:59.507
So what's the use of having
this kind of a democracy and

00:28:59.819 --> 00:29:04.475
this kind of freedom which has
made us mad and idiotic?

00:29:04.881 --> 00:29:07.812
And that's very true about
every democratic country

00:29:08.093 --> 00:29:11.692
because you must know
democracy is money-oriented.

00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:15.867
And you know Greeks are very money
-oriented people also, as well.

00:29:16.148 --> 00:29:18.573
Of course, they're not
as bad as Americans,

00:29:18.867 --> 00:29:20.598
but they are quite
money-oriented.

00:29:20.886 --> 00:29:23.110
Also, Italians are very
money-oriented,

00:29:23.392 --> 00:29:25.804
but the worst is
the corruption.

00:29:26.321 --> 00:29:28.321
Now Italy is getting
exposed.

00:29:28.609 --> 00:29:30.740
I'm sure your country will
also get exposed.

00:29:31.021 --> 00:29:32.715
All these countries
are to be exposed.

00:29:32.984 --> 00:29:36.886
But, first of all, the Sahaja
Yogis have to be firm people.

00:29:37.448 --> 00:29:41.035
They have to be very, very
firm and they should know that

00:29:41.292 --> 00:29:43.605
Sahaja Yoga is only
spirit-oriented,

00:29:43.948 --> 00:29:45.742
nothing but
spirit-oriented,

00:29:46.011 --> 00:29:48.948
that you have to have
your spirit enlightened,

00:29:49.267 --> 00:29:52.455
that your spirit has
to work everything,

00:29:52.698 --> 00:29:56.306
that you are not this body,
this money, this position,

00:29:56.618 --> 00:30:00.154
these powers, nothing.
But you are the spirit.

00:30:00.492 --> 00:30:03.210
This is what one
has to know.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.931
I was told it is very
difficult for you

00:30:07.237 --> 00:30:10.765
to come for pujas
to Cabella

00:30:11.052 --> 00:30:14.688
you all cannot join,
but one week,

00:30:14.988 --> 00:30:18.620
supposing you take
during Guru Puja, I think.

00:30:18.908 --> 00:30:21.089
You can come by boat
or something like that,

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:24.701
would be easier for you to
come to Genoa by boat

00:30:25.001 --> 00:30:27.870
and then we can organize
your coming down.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:31.613
For Guru Puja, you all should
come. You see, Sahasrara Puja

00:30:31.888 --> 00:30:35.313
and Guru Puja are
very important

00:30:35.619 --> 00:30:40.212
and if you could come for Guru
Puja, it would be a very nice idea.

00:30:40.711 --> 00:30:42.799
I think it can be
arranged and organized

00:30:43.092 --> 00:30:46.898
that you can come
to Guru Puja.

00:30:47.479 --> 00:30:50.460
I know it's wherever I am,

00:30:50.766 --> 00:30:55.134
supposing if I have it here, then
for all the rest of the people

00:30:55.445 --> 00:30:58.723
it will be far away. So
I just thought of Milan

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:02.342
being quite in the center that
it would be nearer to England,

00:31:02.623 --> 00:31:05.051
nearer to other European
countries.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.695
You see, the Americans and
the South Americans

00:31:08.958 --> 00:31:11.779
find it very difficult,
so this time

00:31:12.091 --> 00:31:14.301
we had to provide all
tickets, everything

00:31:14.595 --> 00:31:18.095
to South Americans to come.
But they're very deep people.

00:31:18.376 --> 00:31:21.785
I was surprised in Colombia, they
are such good Sahaja Yogis,

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.822
very beautiful
Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:24.141 --> 00:31:28.404
Very simple-hearted, very
good, well educated.

00:31:28.692 --> 00:31:33.144
Three, four of them got married
in India and they're very happy.

00:31:36.172 --> 00:31:43.153
So, now for that, two
things have to be done.

00:31:43.546 --> 00:31:50.996
Firstly, is that you
should come to collective.

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:54.275
It's very important. You all
should come to collective

00:31:54.556 --> 00:31:58.712
and put your - please put attention
to Me, not to them, alright.

00:31:59.099 --> 00:32:01.043
Please put your attention
towards Me,

00:32:01.312 --> 00:32:02.967
don't turn your attention
very much.

00:32:03.242 --> 00:32:07.861
You have to keep your attention
all right. It's very important.

00:32:11.048 --> 00:32:15.323
So you have to one thing is
to do, is to come to the collective

00:32:15.585 --> 00:32:19.268
and watch out for your attention.
Where is your attention?

00:32:19.574 --> 00:32:22.117
Where are you looking? Are you
turning your head too much

00:32:22.406 --> 00:32:24.818
or are you putting your
attention straight?

00:32:25.079 --> 00:32:28.448
It's very important that you
must keep your attention

00:32:28.709 --> 00:32:32.072
absolutely wrapped and
towards the meetings

00:32:32.305 --> 00:32:37.819
that you have here for
your collective.

00:32:38.432 --> 00:32:41.914
In that way, when your
attention is fixed you'll find

00:32:42.152 --> 00:32:45.334
you'll definitely rise into
thoughtless awareness,

00:32:45.589 --> 00:32:47.856
a state where you
grow spiritually.

00:32:48.129 --> 00:32:52.031
You have to rise up to that
state of thoughtless awareness

00:32:52.281 --> 00:32:55.151
where you grow
spiritually.

00:32:55.463 --> 00:32:57.156
If you're not in thoughtless
awareness,

00:32:57.401 --> 00:33:00.122
you cannot grow in
your spirituality.

00:33:00.377 --> 00:33:04.483
So it's very important to
see where is your attention.

00:33:04.726 --> 00:33:06.745
Where are you putting
your attention?

00:33:07.008 --> 00:33:09.089
If the attention could
be controlled

00:33:09.371 --> 00:33:11.414
then things will
be all right.

00:33:11.689 --> 00:33:14.564
He is crying,
the child is crying,

00:33:14.884 --> 00:33:18.302
may be you can take
him outside a litle bit,

00:33:26.914 --> 00:33:32.307
he is feeling hot I think
is all right now with the mother

00:33:47.368 --> 00:33:49.499
So the first thing is to
be in the collective.

00:33:49.786 --> 00:33:56.704
Now it's a very sinister,
also idea of some people

00:33:56.978 --> 00:33:59.909
is to always break the
collective, to create problems,

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:06.614
to disregard the leaders. As a
result, leaders also get so fed up,

00:34:06.908 --> 00:34:09.482
they give up, you see. They don't
want to have anything to do.

00:34:09.819 --> 00:34:14.259
So they put up their own ideas,
they try to trouble the leaders,

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:18.793
they create problems for them, they
just try to show off everywhere,

00:34:19.069 --> 00:34:24.712
as if they know everything. All
such people also create groups.

00:34:25.018 --> 00:34:31.068
So beware about them. You should
stick on always to the collective

00:34:31.356 --> 00:34:37.049
and not to anyone who tries to
create a kind of a group at all

00:34:37.374 --> 00:34:42.936
or who troubles or who
makes things difficult.

00:34:43.505 --> 00:34:47.649
You must understand those who
are collective only will grow,

00:34:47.924 --> 00:34:53.011
those who aren't, will not grow.
Because like a nail, if it breaks,

00:34:53.297 --> 00:34:57.361
then it doesn't grow.
In the same manner,

00:34:57.675 --> 00:35:01.350
if you keep out of this
thing, by any chance,

00:35:01.681 --> 00:35:03.637
if you have any problems
with the leaders,

00:35:03.943 --> 00:35:05.574
you can always
write to Me,

00:35:05.899 --> 00:35:07.766
you can tell Me,
I can work it out.

00:35:08.079 --> 00:35:12.641
But all the time, to go on
like this and grouping

00:35:12.928 --> 00:35:15.846
like this will break and there
will be someone who'll do that.

00:35:16.103 --> 00:35:18.953
There will be some negative
person who'll try to do that.

00:35:19.203 --> 00:35:23.928
So, you have to be very careful
not to get out of the collective.

00:35:24.202 --> 00:35:26.602
You must always
support the collective,

00:35:26.852 --> 00:35:32.208
must help this collective
and must nourish it.

00:35:33.783 --> 00:35:36.232
As you know, I was
telling him also

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.151
that he, if he has
problem with money,

00:35:39.451 --> 00:35:42.132
we can give money
from Cabella

00:35:42.432 --> 00:35:44.613
because before that I used
to travel on My own.

00:35:44.882 --> 00:35:48.807
Even to Greece, I came on
My own, and paid for everything.

00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:52.375
So, see also, then Stomatis
had to pay something,

00:35:52.688 --> 00:35:55.275
which I didn't like very much.
He was paying so much,

00:35:55.549 --> 00:35:57.350
because we had such
a small group.

00:35:57.625 --> 00:36:01.163
But now as you have a big
group, you feel responsible,

00:36:01.462 --> 00:36:03.788
you want to pay for it.
All right, doesn't matter.

00:36:04.087 --> 00:36:09.855
But not to pay for your Sahaja
Yoga, not for your realization,

00:36:10.129 --> 00:36:14.473
not for knowledge of Sahaja
Yoga. This is there.

00:36:14.754 --> 00:36:18.110
And so people will start putting
ideas into your heads that,

00:36:18.372 --> 00:36:20.435
Why this? Why that?",
and all that.

00:36:20.691 --> 00:36:23.540
Such people you should keep
out because you are here

00:36:23.827 --> 00:36:26.277
to develop your spirituality
and not to listen

00:36:26.546 --> 00:36:29.065
to these stupid people who
have been troublesome.

00:36:29.321 --> 00:36:32.577
So best is to keep
to your own,

00:36:33.264 --> 00:36:38.157
own development and own
nourishment. It's very important.

00:36:38.858 --> 00:36:42.545
So it is in a way collective,
but also individual,

00:36:42.825 --> 00:36:45.722
because what you're
gaining out of the collective

00:36:46.028 --> 00:36:48.259
you should be on the watch
out, you should see for yourself

00:36:48.553 --> 00:36:50.697
what you are gaining
out of the collective.

00:36:50.997 --> 00:36:53.515
Then secondly, at home, you
must every day, every day,

00:36:53.815 --> 00:36:57.633
every day, again I say,
not to miss it out,

00:36:57.952 --> 00:37:02.599
in the evening before sleeping
you must have meditation.

00:37:02.886 --> 00:37:05.381
You can wash
yourself up, like,

00:37:05.693 --> 00:37:07.656
what you call, the water
treatment or anything

00:37:07.923 --> 00:37:09.872
then sit down for meditation
for ten minutes.

00:37:10.185 --> 00:37:13.477
You must give fifteen minutes to
yourself and then sleep off.

00:37:13.765 --> 00:37:16.340
Supposing you can't do
one night, doesn't matter,

00:37:16.627 --> 00:37:19.970
but try to do it every
night. If not possible,

00:37:20.239 --> 00:37:22.427
if you don't do it one night,
you can do it in the morning.

00:37:22.726 --> 00:37:26.226
But it's very important. I can
easily make out a person

00:37:26.513 --> 00:37:29.751
who does meditation and
who does not do meditation.

00:37:30.138 --> 00:37:34.850
It's a difference, such a difference.
I immediately know a person

00:37:35.175 --> 00:37:40.075
who is meditating
everyday, in his health,

00:37:40.367 --> 00:37:44.899
in his face, in his behavior,
in everything, he's very different.

00:37:45.228 --> 00:37:48.396
And those who do not do
any meditation you'll find,

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:52.596
not only that they are funny,
but their children are funny,

00:37:52.896 --> 00:37:56.775
their relationships are
funny, everything is funny.

00:37:57.124 --> 00:38:01.149
So the meditation is
a very important part for you.

00:38:01.568 --> 00:38:03.886
Because also the women
who are pregnant, when they,

00:38:04.186 --> 00:38:06.636
if they do not meditate
their children turn out

00:38:06.924 --> 00:38:11.699
to be very troublesome and very
funny. It's a thing like that.

00:38:12.043 --> 00:38:16.468
It effects everything. But your
character of meditativeness,

00:38:16.736 --> 00:38:22.516
your character of Sahaja Yoga
helps everyone, your children,

00:38:22.853 --> 00:38:25.185
your family, your society,
everybody,

00:38:25.441 --> 00:38:29.084
and everybody can make it out
what sort of a family you are,

00:38:29.391 --> 00:38:32.728
what sort of a people you are,
what sort of a personality you are.

00:38:32.984 --> 00:38:34.941
And from you they
take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:35.215 --> 00:38:40.884
So is important in individual life
also just to meditate, nothing else.

00:38:41.497 --> 00:38:46.190
You have to come to a state
of thoughtless awareness.

00:38:46.496 --> 00:38:49.040
So the mantra is, as
you know, Nirvichara.

00:38:49.296 --> 00:38:51.358
You should use the
mantra of Nirvichara

00:38:51.632 --> 00:38:53.814
for coming to the
state of thoughtlessness

00:38:54.077 --> 00:38:56.228
and try to increase
this area,

00:38:56.546 --> 00:38:58.426
this space of thoughtless
awareness

00:38:58.714 --> 00:39:02.807
and that is how you will find
you will be growing very much.

00:39:03.301 --> 00:39:07.325
Now as you get lots of powers,
as you get lots of people

00:39:07.657 --> 00:39:10.343
being realized by you,
curing by you,

00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:13.128
sometimes maybe it
might affect your ego.

00:39:13.377 --> 00:39:17.640
You might get into ego things.
For such people, I have to say

00:39:17.928 --> 00:39:20.928
that you have to be introspective
and see for yourself.

00:39:21.221 --> 00:39:23.746
You face the mirror and ask
now how much ego you have.

00:39:24.046 --> 00:39:27.202
Laugh at yourself. Once you
start laughing at yourself,

00:39:27.477 --> 00:39:29.932
your ego will drop out
and you'll understand

00:39:30.189 --> 00:39:34.189
that it was false to have this
kind of ego within you.

00:39:34.475 --> 00:39:37.718
There are so many ways and methods
of finding out about yourself.

00:39:38.007 --> 00:39:41.275
Put yourself into bandhan and put
your hands towards the photograph,

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:43.988
immediately you can feel what
chakras are catching

00:39:44.295 --> 00:39:48.288
and you know how to clear it out.
Also sometimes you feel it inside.

00:39:48.557 --> 00:39:50.971
If your chakras are catching,
you can feel it inside

00:39:51.272 --> 00:39:56.368
and you can feel it,
the different centers

00:39:56.637 --> 00:39:58.980
on your fingertips
about yourself.

00:39:59.261 --> 00:40:03.654
So it is about yourself you will
know. About others, you know,

00:40:03.929 --> 00:40:06.028
you should just talk on
chakras. You should not say,

00:40:06.301 --> 00:40:09.203
he's bhootish, or he has ego
- nothing. But you should say,

00:40:09.466 --> 00:40:12.709
his Agnya is catching,
means he has got ego.

00:40:13.028 --> 00:40:15.984
You can say, his Nabhi's bad,
his, this thing is bad.

00:40:16.246 --> 00:40:17.914
So the language is
to change now.

00:40:18.189 --> 00:40:23.239
We have to talk in the
language of Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:23.939 --> 00:40:27.795
It is to be understood that
now we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:28.082 --> 00:40:31.319
We've got the powers
we have vibratory powers.

00:40:31.599 --> 00:40:36.211
But if you don't use these vibratory
powers, what is going to happen?

00:40:37.018 --> 00:40:39.024
We have to use them,
that's the point.

00:40:39.268 --> 00:40:41.455
We always forget. I've
seen, the other day

00:40:41.733 --> 00:40:43.586
they couldn't open something.
I said, "Give a bandhan."

00:40:43.867 --> 00:40:46.260
Gave a bandhan and immediately
it worked out, you see.

00:40:46.529 --> 00:40:48.496
Small, small things also
you'll be surprised

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.591
that if it doesn't work out, you have
to just give a bandhan

00:40:50.836 --> 00:40:52.302
and it works out.

00:40:52.641 --> 00:40:55.003
It is important to know
that you are Sahaja Yogis,

00:40:55.291 --> 00:40:57.928
you are saints and that
you can do lots of things

00:40:58.209 --> 00:41:00.472
and you shouldn't forget it.
You shouldn't forget it

00:41:00.722 --> 00:41:03.740
that you are Sahaja Yogis. Now
you are no more ordinary people.

00:41:04.015 --> 00:41:06.533
You are saints now and
you can do a lot.

00:41:06.815 --> 00:41:10.783
All this, when it works out,
you'll be amazed at yourself how,

00:41:11.077 --> 00:41:13.958
how you have achieved
all these things.

00:41:14.281 --> 00:41:17.419
And, I tell you, people tell Me
that they look like roses,

00:41:17.694 --> 00:41:20.489
all of their faces shining,
they look so beautiful and

00:41:20.791 --> 00:41:22.846
they can make it out that
you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:41:23.159 --> 00:41:25.568
I've seen at the airport
also many people say that,

00:41:25.863 --> 00:41:27.250
"Who were those people

00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:32.426
looking so sweet and beautiful,
shining. Who were those?"

00:41:32.785 --> 00:41:35.491
So if I tell them that they
are saints, they won't believe

00:41:35.785 --> 00:41:38.241
that there could be so
many saints, but there are

00:41:38.517 --> 00:41:40.841
and we have achieved
that all over the world.

00:41:41.116 --> 00:41:43.410
All over the world now there
are so many Sahaja Yogis

00:41:43.691 --> 00:41:47.762
that I can't even say how many they
are, in thousands and thousands.

00:41:48.082 --> 00:41:50.242
So, I again tell
you that Greece

00:41:50.509 --> 00:41:52.577
is a place where
you can do a lot.

00:41:52.858 --> 00:41:55.870
First of all, you must establish
yourself in Sahaja Yoga

00:41:56.127 --> 00:41:59.295
and you have to
know what you are,

00:41:59.577 --> 00:42:02.014
all the time to remember what
you are. You are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:42:02.301 --> 00:42:04.513
Even to children, you have
to say, "You are a Sahaja Yogi,"

00:42:04.789 --> 00:42:07.556
so they also develop that
personality by which

00:42:07.868 --> 00:42:10.731
they behave properly and
they behave in a manner

00:42:11.044 --> 00:42:13.805
that a Sahaja Yogi
should behave.

00:42:14.912 --> 00:42:19.962
So all these things are just
the preliminaries of Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:20.249 --> 00:42:24.061
but I am sure you must be
getting my tapes from Cabella

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:27.174
and you must be knowing
about all the deeper things

00:42:27.455 --> 00:42:29.922
about yourself and
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:30.205 --> 00:42:34.029
It's a new age
that has started.

00:42:34.330 --> 00:42:37.630
The other day I said that the
Satya Yuga has started now.

00:42:37.973 --> 00:42:40.366
So it will start exposing
all that is a-satya,

00:42:40.673 --> 00:42:43.309
which is whatever is false.
All those who are false people

00:42:43.603 --> 00:42:47.746
will be exposed and you'll
be amazed at the way

00:42:48.052 --> 00:42:52.451
things will work out. And it's
such a great time you are born

00:42:52.781 --> 00:42:55.900
and it's such a great thing that
you have come to Sahaja Yoga

00:42:56.188 --> 00:42:58.059
and that you have
got your realization

00:42:58.309 --> 00:43:00.326
and that you are
one of those

00:43:00.638 --> 00:43:05.595
who have to lift the whole of this
universe into a higher awareness.

00:43:05.888 --> 00:43:07.900
Of course, we can't say
how many will be saved.

00:43:08.188 --> 00:43:12.088
It's another point because
what I know about is that

00:43:12.369 --> 00:43:16.999
in the evolutionary portion,
supposing we came from chimpanzees,

00:43:17.267 --> 00:43:20.224
many were lost
in between, you know,

00:43:20.524 --> 00:43:24.274
and there are so many
chimpanzees now left

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.217
and there's the middle,
the people were lost.

00:43:27.504 --> 00:43:29.447
In the same way, many
human beings may be lost

00:43:29.735 --> 00:43:33.808
because of their stupidity, because
of their self-destructive habits

00:43:34.087 --> 00:43:36.310
that they have formed.

00:43:36.673 --> 00:43:38.554
But your responsibility
is very great.

00:43:38.779 --> 00:43:41.660
Don't think, I am just mediocre.
I'm good for nothing.

00:43:41.916 --> 00:43:43.285
Never. Never think
like that.

00:43:43.563 --> 00:43:47.328
You are all saints and you
are capable of great things.

00:43:47.647 --> 00:43:50.165
May God bless you.

00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:57.246
So today they want to
do the puja of Athena

00:43:57.616 --> 00:44:00.477
And you will be surprised
that the names of Athena

00:44:00.766 --> 00:44:06.252
are exactly about the same as
that of the Goddess, of Adi Shakti.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:09.533
Is very surprising, they
have such beautiful names.

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:13.765
But we can have hundred
and eight names of… today

00:44:14.013 --> 00:44:16.918
and you can read the
names and the meanings

00:44:17.181 --> 00:44:19.162
and they can
say the mantras.

00:44:19.469 --> 00:44:21.931
But first the children
have to wash My feet

00:44:22.206 --> 00:44:25.543
with Ganesha stuti,
you can sing

00:44:25.981 --> 00:44:27.723
Ganesha stuti.

00:44:28.049 --> 00:44:32.766
You've got some musical
instrument or not?

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:36.098
Yes, yes.
You have.
