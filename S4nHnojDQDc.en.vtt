09:57.667 --> 10:03.648
It's a very great day for Me to
see so many Sahaja Yogis here

10:04.042 --> 10:10.899
who are from this
country, Greece.

10:12.643 --> 10:16.218
When first I came
to Greece,

10:16.530 --> 10:21.174
I told My husband that this
country is full of vibrations

10:21.455 --> 10:27.061
and there have been many
evolved souls in this country

10:27.574 --> 10:31.088
but perhaps the people
have lost their heritage,

10:31.475 --> 10:34.507
but the vibrations are
in the atmosphere

10:34.957 --> 10:39.790
and one day Sahaja Yoga
should prosper here very much.

10:40.584 --> 10:48.291
And somehow, we met some
bureaucrats who were Greeks and

10:48.691 --> 10:53.165
the experience was not good with
them and My husband said

10:53.440 --> 10:57.266
that, "If you said that Greeks
are really religious people,

10:57.527 --> 11:00.483
then look at these people
- what are they doing to me?"

11:00.790 --> 11:04.327
I said, "They may be bureaucrats
and all over, bureaucrats,

11:04.596 --> 11:06.717
you can't say what sort
of people they could be."

11:06.964 --> 11:13.282
But, on the whole, the vibrations
were very, very good, no doubt,

11:13.607 --> 11:19.480
and I went to all the places
in here, like I went to Delphi,

11:19.780 --> 11:23.649
I went up there to see Athena's
temple and everything.

11:23.986 --> 11:29.579
To all the places of interest,
they took Me round, especially Me,

11:32.235 --> 11:35.385
because he was busy
with his conference,

11:35.659 --> 11:39.553
and so they took Me round.
And everywhere I felt

11:39.853 --> 11:44.372
even the sea I felt was
so beautiful. This was about,

11:44.665 --> 11:49.598
I think I came here at least
about fifteen years back,

11:49.867 --> 11:55.167
maybe fourteen years
back - and I find now

11:56.211 --> 11:59.672
the vibrations are coming
back now through you people

12:00.097 --> 12:03.378
and the whole place
is again vibrating.

12:03.665 --> 12:05.489
Now, you have to understand
that you people

12:05.821 --> 12:09.089
have a very big responsibility
because you're

12:09.339 --> 12:13.570
strategically placed
in Greece, you see.

12:13.882 --> 12:19.720
Creece and Italy, I mean Turkey,
both are very important.

12:20.439 --> 12:24.511
First of all, you are the bridge
between the eastern side

12:24.774 --> 12:29.686
and the western side and
everybody is interested in,

12:30.061 --> 12:33.333
somehow or another,
managing these two areas

12:33.627 --> 12:38.946
so that hey could control
eastern and western side.

12:41.150 --> 12:44.365
I mean the western
countries especially.

12:44.633 --> 12:47.252
Now the greatest danger
that you have now

12:47.534 --> 12:51.715
is that this western culture
may try to grab you

12:52.040 --> 12:55.175
and which is very
dangerous.

12:56.770 --> 12:59.638
To understand it,
you have to know

12:59.944 --> 13:03.738
that you are people coming
from a very great tradition,

13:04.082 --> 13:08.427
ancient people of ages
just like Indians,

13:09.159 --> 13:15.720
and there is so much you can do
to improve the culture of Europe

13:16.063 --> 13:19.001
by your own behavior.

13:19.289 --> 13:23.568
Like these people we have
coming here, tourists are coming,

13:24.062 --> 13:30.168
and they see the
behavior of the Greeks

13:30.718 --> 13:36.017
and they see that they
can influence very well,

13:37.555 --> 13:43.849
the Europeans, think that Greeks
can be very easily influenced

13:44.093 --> 13:48.061
by their culture,
by their cheap life.

13:48.798 --> 13:53.648
So, as you being the
such traditional people,

13:53.942 --> 13:59.217
down to earth and
so many, so many

13:59.759 --> 14:04.365
good things you
have known in life,

14:04.710 --> 14:08.878
it's very important to
understand the historical

14:09.185 --> 14:11.768
background of your country,
first of all.

14:12.043 --> 14:17.129
For Sahaja Yogis it is very
important to be educated that way

14:17.410 --> 14:20.279
because tomorrow you'll have
to talk to other people

14:20.610 --> 14:25.748
and you'll have to tell them
about Athena, about your traditions,

14:26.030 --> 14:30.686
about your background and how
it is connected to Sahaja Yoga,

14:30.973 --> 14:35.153
connected to Mother Mary, connected
to Christ and all those things.

14:35.440 --> 14:40.564
For this, it is very necessary that
we all should try to understand

14:40.864 --> 14:43.594
the historical background
of this country

14:44.154 --> 14:50.085
and educate yourself in a way that
you can talk about Sahaja Yoga.

14:50.847 --> 14:54.165
As it is, you know, Athena has
the Kundalini in Her hand

14:54.497 --> 14:59.161
and you can see that clearly
that She was the Adi Shakti.

14:59.465 --> 15:03.165
Actually, in Sanskrit language
atha means primordial.

15:03.434 --> 15:05.965
So She was
the Primordial Mother.

15:06.514 --> 15:07.918
Because there was
no connection

15:08.187 --> 15:10.849
left between the Greeks
and the Indians,

15:11.126 --> 15:14.495
this, I mean, translation

15:14.782 --> 15:19.489
was not there and they didn't
know what it meant by Athena.

15:20.563 --> 15:23.819
But Indians know that it
is this is the place

15:24.125 --> 15:29.717
for the manifestation
of the Adi Shakti

15:30.118 --> 15:34.683
because in the Devi Mahatmyam,
if you read, or you will find out

15:35.002 --> 15:38.648
they have described Greece
as the Manipurndwip.

15:38.973 --> 15:45.523
Means the island in the Manipur.
Manipur is this Nabhi Chakra.

15:45.873 --> 15:52.497
So in the Nabhi there's an
island where it is your Greece,

15:52.833 --> 15:57.125
where the Goddess resides.
Manipur chakra is where She resides.

15:58.414 --> 16:02.551
And so, this Athena has
been described,

16:02.789 --> 16:06.902
and when I went to Her
temple I found that there was

16:07.196 --> 16:13.274
a little temple for the child God.
That was Shri Ganesha.

16:13.552 --> 16:17.014
And then, when I went to Delphi,
also, when I went there

16:17.295 --> 16:20.321
I was surprised to see, they showed
Me a mound and said,

16:20.608 --> 16:24.252
"This is the Nabhi, navel
of the whole universe."

16:24.515 --> 16:27.502
I said, "That's correct." But when
I turned round there

16:27.777 --> 16:32.182
were lots of vibrations and what
I find is a Ganesha statue there.

16:32.875 --> 16:35.039
Then Gregoire came here
he took photographs

16:35.339 --> 16:37.439
and everything
and he saw that.

16:37.740 --> 16:41.221
So now you are the Nabhi.
You are sitting here in the Nabhi

16:41.496 --> 16:44.558
of the whole universe.
So how important is Nabhi?

16:44.877 --> 16:49.613
You know that very well,
that Nabhi Chakra gets spoilt,

16:49.881 --> 16:53.800
the whole life becomes
miserable for a human being.

16:54.088 --> 16:57.600
So, on the right side of
the Nabhi, as you see,

16:58.425 --> 17:04.900
is the liver and because, of course,
we had lots of philosophers,

17:05.212 --> 17:09.824
they used to think a lot and
they created lots of tragedies,

17:10.093 --> 17:13.990
you see Greek tragedy's well
known, where a marriage system was

17:14.284 --> 17:19.365
little bit challenged, that
there was, say, two men,

17:19.658 --> 17:23.053
one woman or maybe
two women, one man

17:23.316 --> 17:26.535
and never they felt happy
with the marriage.

17:26.841 --> 17:30.751
So the left Nabhi was
under attack, throughout.

17:31.045 --> 17:36.048
To have such a tragedy, they
wrote so many, I would say,

17:36.373 --> 17:41.880
so many dramas and they played them
here and so many plays were there

17:42.180 --> 17:45.199
showing that there are two
men and one woman

17:45.506 --> 17:49.506
or two women and one
man and no relationship

17:49.811 --> 17:53.066
between the husband
and wife which was pure.

17:53.349 --> 17:54.702
And that was the tragedy.

17:54.964 --> 17:57.939
It's known all over
as the Greek tragedy.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.633
It's all imaginary
and people, you see,

18:00.908 --> 18:04.139
became very left-sided to
begin with. They started thinking,

18:04.395 --> 18:07.615
Oh, this life is a misery.
It's a tragedy.

18:07.859 --> 18:11.396
What should we do?
Why should we?

18:11.821 --> 18:16.621
Why should we try to
show that we are happy?

18:16.896 --> 18:18.634
We are very
unhappy people.

18:18.902 --> 18:22.077
And all these things
started here to begin with.

18:22.377 --> 18:25.514
Then came these
your Orthodox Church.

18:25.814 --> 18:29.045
Now this Orthodox Church is
another one, which, of course,

18:29.270 --> 18:33.338
is really doesn't treat women
very well and treats them

18:33.601 --> 18:39.007
as if they are all the
time unholy. Certain times

18:39.276 --> 18:42.738
they cannot go to church
and they cannot touch people,

18:43.007 --> 18:45.850
all kinds of nonsensical
ideas they had.

18:46.206 --> 18:49.288
That also made women
very left-sided.

18:49.613 --> 18:52.307
Then, on top of that,
all this was happening

18:52.589 --> 18:54.563
with these tragedies
and all that.

18:54.976 --> 19:01.540
Suddenly the economic problem
came up and people felt very,

19:01.827 --> 19:04.941
sort of, disgusted
about that.

19:05.262 --> 19:07.394
So the left side
became very,

19:07.712 --> 19:11.194
very prominent here
and that is how I think

19:11.450 --> 19:13.791
many of these left-sided,

19:14.060 --> 19:17.979
bhootish organizations
started here

19:18.566 --> 19:22.504
and many gurus came who
made you feel miserable.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.378
But the worst that was
done by the Greek Church

19:25.728 --> 19:28.242
which made you feel so guilty.

19:28.548 --> 19:31.592
So you became
very left-sided.

19:32.530 --> 19:35.974
Now this left-sidedness was
later on counter-balanced

19:36.249 --> 19:38.727
by people who started
becoming overactive;

19:38.996 --> 19:42.952
thinking too much, working too
hard and all those things.

19:43.296 --> 19:46.633
But still, I think that they don't
work very hard as they should work.

19:46.890 --> 19:49.327
They're on the lazy side,
the Greeks are.

19:49.620 --> 19:52.386
They're on the lazy side. Of course,
the Sahaja Yogis are not.

19:52.642 --> 19:54.108
The Sahaja Yogis have
worked very hard,

19:54.414 --> 19:57.425
I can see all that very
clearly, but otherwise.

19:57.744 --> 20:03.833
So, now to bring
out Sahaja Yoga

20:04.195 --> 20:07.456
in Greece, is important,
first of all, to know

20:07.712 --> 20:11.244
what is our historical
background.

20:11.507 --> 20:13.957
The second, they should
be very well equipped

20:14.187 --> 20:17.381
with the knowledge
of chakras and centers

20:17.669 --> 20:23.771
and how to improve these centers.
If you do not have that knowledge,

20:24.021 --> 20:26.913
you cannot face people. It's not
that only men should know,

20:27.176 --> 20:29.828
women also should
know everything about it.

20:30.084 --> 20:33.716
What is the chakras are,
how they work out

20:35.303 --> 20:40.400
and what are their results
are, how do we suffer

20:40.668 --> 20:42.880
because our chakras
are in danger.

20:43.180 --> 20:45.817
All this knowledge
is free to you.

20:46.283 --> 20:49.059
You don't have to pay for
this knowledge. Only thing,

20:49.321 --> 20:52.920
every day-to-day life, when you
start working out Sahaja Yoga,

20:53.220 --> 20:58.639
then you'll find that what I'm
saying is absolutely tangible.

20:58.920 --> 21:03.961
You can verify it. It is so.
It's not something in the air.

21:04.204 --> 21:07.780
It is absolutely there.
We can prove everything

21:08.025 --> 21:11.678
that we believe in and we
can show others also

21:11.946 --> 21:15.584
that this is the truth.
Is an absolute truth.

21:15.884 --> 21:18.077
We are not here to
spread some sort

21:18.365 --> 21:21.941
of a fanaticism or racialism
or anything like that,

21:22.227 --> 21:25.215
but we are here to combine
the whole world together

21:25.515 --> 21:29.810
under one understanding; that
we belong to one universe

21:30.091 --> 21:33.879
and we have one
universal religion.

21:34.322 --> 21:35.753
Now, people will ask
you then,

21:36.034 --> 21:38.453
"Have we to give up
your religion?"

21:38.716 --> 21:40.141
You don't have to tell them that
you have to give up your religion,

21:40.391 --> 21:43.174
don't have to say that. You don't
have to be hard with them at all.

21:43.430 --> 21:45.586
On the contrary, no, no, no,
nothing has to be done.

21:45.900 --> 21:50.449
You just come and take to Sahaja
Yoga and take to your spirit.

21:50.736 --> 21:54.331
Gradually it will start
opening out.

21:54.762 --> 21:56.531
It has happened with
all of you

21:56.787 --> 21:58.537
that first when you
came to Sahaja Yoga

21:58.831 --> 22:01.572
you were in a different
shape. Now gradually,

22:01.884 --> 22:03.478
you started opening
out, you matured

22:03.766 --> 22:06.465
and you understood
Sahaja Yoga very well.

22:06.746 --> 22:11.538
In the same way, you must
teach others in the same manner,

22:11.870 --> 22:16.647
with the same understanding,
compassion and love.

22:16.897 --> 22:20.053
Otherwise, normally people
think that somebody

22:20.353 --> 22:22.664
is to be condemned
all the time.

22:22.920 --> 22:27.061
Of course, some are people
who are under bad influence

22:27.348 --> 22:31.122
and you cannot get along
with them, but most of you

22:31.410 --> 22:35.604
should know that we have to get
more people into Sahaja Yoga

22:35.885 --> 22:42.135
through our compassion, love
and also lot of understanding

22:42.403 --> 22:48.665
about others' feelings. I've
found that even countries

22:48.990 --> 22:51.809
where have been Sahaja
Yoga for so many time,

22:52.115 --> 22:57.275
suddenly someone comes up
and starts giving trouble

22:57.575 --> 23:02.569
and becoming bhootish sort of
thing, you see, and misbehaving.

23:02.894 --> 23:06.931
Suddenly, it happens. Such a person,
you know, if it is informed,

23:07.187 --> 23:09.993
we can take him out of Sahaja
Yoga. We can cleanse him.

23:10.299 --> 23:12.979
But all of you must know
one thing for definite

23:13.260 --> 23:16.685
that you all have these
powers to cure yourself,

23:16.966 --> 23:19.185
improve yourself,
to help others.

23:19.466 --> 23:21.701
You can do everything
yourself.

23:22.008 --> 23:24.711
You all have these powers,
but the only thing

23:24.979 --> 23:27.029
is you have to be
sincere and honest.

23:27.361 --> 23:31.142
If you are not sincere and
honest, it will never work out.

23:31.467 --> 23:34.473
On the contrary, it will
boomerang on you.

23:34.773 --> 23:39.889
So, in Sahaja Yoga, it's very impor-
tant is the sincerity of purpose.

23:40.251 --> 23:42.951
You must have complete
sincerity of purpose

23:43.219 --> 23:48.473
that you are here to achieve your
own self-emancipation, first.

23:48.787 --> 23:55.936
And secondly, you are
here to help others.

23:57.155 --> 24:01.886
The people all along in the
whole world now require help.

24:02.193 --> 24:05.955
There's so many problems,
so many catastrophes,

24:06.299 --> 24:12.792
so many horrible things
we everyday know going on.

24:13.042 --> 24:15.660
So now we need people who
are solid, who are balanced,

24:15.923 --> 24:19.923
who are peaceful, who understand
what is right and what is wrong.

24:20.623 --> 24:22.243
But apart from that,
you should know

24:22.476 --> 24:26.130
that you have now entered
into the Kingdom of God.

24:26.368 --> 24:28.924
Many people will say, all right,
we were so religious,

24:29.157 --> 24:31.157
we were praying to Christ,
we were praying to this one,

24:31.384 --> 24:34.066
praying to that one.
What did we get?

24:34.333 --> 24:36.935
You cannot get it because
you are not connected.

24:37.191 --> 24:40.571
You have to be connected. Once
you are connected to that,

24:40.820 --> 24:44.570
then you will find that
things start sorting out.

24:44.859 --> 24:48.513
But sincerity is very important
and faith in yourself.

24:48.922 --> 24:52.745
You must have faith in yourself
that you're quite capable,

24:52.973 --> 24:57.268
quite capable person and
you can achieve

24:57.829 --> 25:02.074
a very high degree of awareness by
which you can work out many things.

25:02.307 --> 25:05.500
It doesn't matter from what sort
of background you come in.

25:05.789 --> 25:08.095
It doesn't matter from what sort
of country you come in,

25:08.351 --> 25:09.573
race anything.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.288
You all can do very well

25:11.533 --> 25:16.520
and we have seen this happening in
so many countries where we had

25:16.751 --> 25:23.606
no hope at all. For example,
a country like Russia,

25:24.390 --> 25:28.005
imagine, they've never
worshipped any God.

25:28.238 --> 25:31.266
They didn't know about God.
They were not allowed to know

25:31.510 --> 25:33.766
about any religion,
anything,

25:34.053 --> 25:37.885
but suddenly I went there, I don't
know, they recognized Me, suddenly.

25:38.266 --> 25:41.309
They just recognized Me and
just with My photograph

25:41.640 --> 25:43.858
I find them there. I was
amazed that the first time

25:44.158 --> 25:52.839
I went to Leningrad there were
two thousand seats in the hall,

25:53.202 --> 25:55.359
but outside they were
all standing. I said,

25:55.652 --> 25:57.283
"Why are they standing
outside?" They said,

25:57.558 --> 25:59.920
"All the seats are full, Mother,
and these are extra people.

26:00.265 --> 26:03.556
There are more than two
thousand outside." So I said,

26:03.875 --> 26:07.194
"This is too much." And so they
said, "Mother, what about us?"

26:07.500 --> 26:09.325
I said, "All right, let me
finish the program."

26:09.619 --> 26:12.258
I went inside, did the program,
everything happened

26:12.634 --> 26:13.684
and you'll be amazed

26:13.900 --> 26:17.406
when we had the program,
the people who were outside

26:17.703 --> 26:20.662
were still waiting. I gave
realization to people

26:20.925 --> 26:22.768
and they were waiting,
waiting, waiting.

26:23.037 --> 26:25.612
When I came out
I gave them.

26:26.318 --> 26:27.735
I said, "Now, what to do?

26:28.011 --> 26:30.148
I can't give you
realization just now."

26:30.429 --> 26:32.586
So they said, "All right,
what can we do?"

26:32.898 --> 26:34.769
I said, "Tomorrow morning
can you come?" They said,

26:35.069 --> 26:38.267
"All right." So all those who were
inside and those who were outside,

26:38.517 --> 26:41.470
all of them came and
came and sat down

26:41.757 --> 26:46.722
and that open ground and
I gave them realization.

26:47.003 --> 26:50.097
So this is the first beginning,
but now in Moscow

26:50.378 --> 26:56.124
or any place we have to
reserve a huge, big stadium.

26:56.487 --> 26:59.343
Fourteen to sixteen
thousand people are there

26:59.606 --> 27:03.268
and realization is
being given.

27:03.699 --> 27:06.286
But they are so quick
to accept Sahaja Yoga,

27:06.555 --> 27:10.979
so quick to accept Me, so quick
to understand Sahaja Yoga.

27:11.273 --> 27:16.495
I just can't imagine how these
Russians have got this capacity.

27:18.278 --> 27:20.022
No question of their
going back,

27:20.328 --> 27:22.678
no question of their
sincerity being challenged.

27:22.966 --> 27:28.798
There is no question of their
doubting themselves, nothing.

27:29.173 --> 27:33.648
Just there and so much so,
so much that I sometimes feel

27:33.967 --> 27:36.429
this democracy has
just harmed us.

27:36.898 --> 27:39.861
Because of democracy,of course,
we could do Sahaja Yoga all right,

27:40.148 --> 27:45.131
but where the people are,
absolutely sometimes very idiotic.

27:45.469 --> 27:48.943
Like in America, I find there's
very idiotic people live there

27:49.206 --> 27:53.768
and they were only busy
choosing their bathrooms

27:54.087 --> 27:58.343
and their curtains and their soaps
and all the time they will choose,

27:58.630 --> 28:01.086
only busy with all these
nonsensical things.

28:01.367 --> 28:08.004
They are so idiotic, while the
people in Russia are so sensible,

28:08.292 --> 28:15.075
so deep, so introspective and
even the artists and the scientists.

28:16.375 --> 28:20.849
I had a conference with the scientists.
There were about three hundred of them

28:21.250 --> 28:23.274
and I started talking to
them about science.

28:23.531 --> 28:24.781
I thought, better start
with science.

28:25.068 --> 28:26.699
They said, "Mother, no more
science, no more science.

28:26.999 --> 28:30.761
Tell us the science
of God."

28:32.393 --> 28:33.893
Such open-minded people.

28:34.130 --> 28:37.018
We have two hundred
doctors in Russia

28:37.311 --> 28:42.299
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga
and it has spread up to Siberia.

28:45.748 --> 28:47.777
Now, what's the use
of this democracy

28:48.033 --> 28:51.213
which doesn't take us to God.
It doesn't give us sense

28:51.482 --> 28:55.270
that we should seek God and
we should be humble towards God.

28:55.576 --> 28:59.507
So what's the use of having
this kind of a democracy and

28:59.819 --> 29:04.475
this kind of freedom which has
made us mad and idiotic?

29:04.881 --> 29:07.812
And that's very true about
every democratic country

29:08.093 --> 29:11.692
because you must know
democracy is money-oriented.

29:12.549 --> 29:15.867
And you know Greeks are very money
-oriented people also, as well.

29:16.148 --> 29:18.573
Of course, they're not
as bad as Americans,

29:18.867 --> 29:20.598
but they are quite
money-oriented.

29:20.886 --> 29:23.110
Also, Italians are very
money-oriented,

29:23.392 --> 29:25.804
but the worst is
the corruption.

29:26.321 --> 29:28.321
Now Italy is getting
exposed.

29:28.609 --> 29:30.740
I'm sure your country will
also get exposed.

29:31.021 --> 29:32.715
All these countries
are to be exposed.

29:32.984 --> 29:36.886
But, first of all, the Sahaja
Yogis have to be firm people.

29:37.448 --> 29:41.035
They have to be very, very
firm and they should know that

29:41.292 --> 29:43.605
Sahaja Yoga is only
spirit-oriented,

29:43.948 --> 29:45.742
nothing but
spirit-oriented,

29:46.011 --> 29:48.948
that you have to have
your spirit enlightened,

29:49.267 --> 29:52.455
that your spirit has
to work everything,

29:52.698 --> 29:56.306
that you are not this body,
this money, this position,

29:56.618 --> 30:00.154
these powers, nothing.
But you are the spirit.

30:00.492 --> 30:03.210
This is what one
has to know.

30:03.560 --> 30:06.931
I was told it is very
difficult for you

30:07.237 --> 30:10.765
to come for pujas
to Cabella

30:11.052 --> 30:14.688
you all cannot join,
but one week,

30:14.988 --> 30:18.620
supposing you take
during Guru Puja, I think.

30:18.908 --> 30:21.089
You can come by boat
or something like that,

30:21.370 --> 30:24.701
would be easier for you to
come to Genoa by boat

30:25.001 --> 30:27.870
and then we can organize
your coming down.

30:28.170 --> 30:31.613
For Guru Puja, you all should
come. You see, Sahasrara Puja

30:31.888 --> 30:35.313
and Guru Puja are
very important

30:35.619 --> 30:40.212
and if you could come for Guru
Puja, it would be a very nice idea.

30:40.711 --> 30:42.799
I think it can be
arranged and organized

30:43.092 --> 30:46.898
that you can come
to Guru Puja.

30:47.479 --> 30:50.460
I know it's wherever I am,

30:50.766 --> 30:55.134
supposing if I have it here, then
for all the rest of the people

30:55.445 --> 30:58.723
it will be far away. So
I just thought of Milan

30:59.010 --> 31:02.342
being quite in the center that
it would be nearer to England,

31:02.623 --> 31:05.051
nearer to other European
countries.

31:06.020 --> 31:08.695
You see, the Americans and
the South Americans

31:08.958 --> 31:11.779
find it very difficult,
so this time

31:12.091 --> 31:14.301
we had to provide all
tickets, everything

31:14.595 --> 31:18.095
to South Americans to come.
But they're very deep people.

31:18.376 --> 31:21.785
I was surprised in Colombia, they
are such good Sahaja Yogis,

31:22.060 --> 31:23.822
very beautiful
Sahaja Yogis.

31:24.141 --> 31:28.404
Very simple-hearted, very
good, well educated.

31:28.692 --> 31:33.144
Three, four of them got married
in India and they're very happy.

31:36.172 --> 31:43.153
So, now for that, two
things have to be done.

31:43.546 --> 31:50.996
Firstly, is that you
should come to collective.

31:51.290 --> 31:54.275
It's very important. You all
should come to collective

31:54.556 --> 31:58.712
and put your - please put attention
to Me, not to them, alright.

31:59.099 --> 32:01.043
Please put your attention
towards Me,

32:01.312 --> 32:02.967
don't turn your attention
very much.

32:03.242 --> 32:07.861
You have to keep your attention
all right. It's very important.

32:11.048 --> 32:15.323
So you have to one thing is
to do, is to come to the collective

32:15.585 --> 32:19.268
and watch out for your attention.
Where is your attention?

32:19.574 --> 32:22.117
Where are you looking? Are you
turning your head too much

32:22.406 --> 32:24.818
or are you putting your
attention straight?

32:25.079 --> 32:28.448
It's very important that you
must keep your attention

32:28.709 --> 32:32.072
absolutely wrapped and
towards the meetings

32:32.305 --> 32:37.819
that you have here for
your collective.

32:38.432 --> 32:41.914
In that way, when your
attention is fixed you'll find

32:42.152 --> 32:45.334
you'll definitely rise into
thoughtless awareness,

32:45.589 --> 32:47.856
a state where you
grow spiritually.

32:48.129 --> 32:52.031
You have to rise up to that
state of thoughtless awareness

32:52.281 --> 32:55.151
where you grow
spiritually.

32:55.463 --> 32:57.156
If you're not in thoughtless
awareness,

32:57.401 --> 33:00.122
you cannot grow in
your spirituality.

33:00.377 --> 33:04.483
So it's very important to
see where is your attention.

33:04.726 --> 33:06.745
Where are you putting
your attention?

33:07.008 --> 33:09.089
If the attention could
be controlled

33:09.371 --> 33:11.414
then things will
be all right.

33:11.689 --> 33:14.564
He is crying,
the child is crying,

33:14.884 --> 33:18.302
may be you can take
him outside a litle bit,

33:26.914 --> 33:32.307
he is feeling hot I think
is all right now with the mother

33:47.368 --> 33:49.499
So the first thing is to
be in the collective.

33:49.786 --> 33:56.704
Now it's a very sinister,
also idea of some people

33:56.978 --> 33:59.909
is to always break the
collective, to create problems,

34:00.190 --> 34:06.614
to disregard the leaders. As a
result, leaders also get so fed up,

34:06.908 --> 34:09.482
they give up, you see. They don't
want to have anything to do.

34:09.819 --> 34:14.259
So they put up their own ideas,
they try to trouble the leaders,

34:14.500 --> 34:18.793
they create problems for them, they
just try to show off everywhere,

34:19.069 --> 34:24.712
as if they know everything. All
such people also create groups.

34:25.018 --> 34:31.068
So beware about them. You should
stick on always to the collective

34:31.356 --> 34:37.049
and not to anyone who tries to
create a kind of a group at all

34:37.374 --> 34:42.936
or who troubles or who
makes things difficult.

34:43.505 --> 34:47.649
You must understand those who
are collective only will grow,

34:47.924 --> 34:53.011
those who aren't, will not grow.
Because like a nail, if it breaks,

34:53.297 --> 34:57.361
then it doesn't grow.
In the same manner,

34:57.675 --> 35:01.350
if you keep out of this
thing, by any chance,

35:01.681 --> 35:03.637
if you have any problems
with the leaders,

35:03.943 --> 35:05.574
you can always
write to Me,

35:05.899 --> 35:07.766
you can tell Me,
I can work it out.

35:08.079 --> 35:12.641
But all the time, to go on
like this and grouping

35:12.928 --> 35:15.846
like this will break and there
will be someone who'll do that.

35:16.103 --> 35:18.953
There will be some negative
person who'll try to do that.

35:19.203 --> 35:23.928
So, you have to be very careful
not to get out of the collective.

35:24.202 --> 35:26.602
You must always
support the collective,

35:26.852 --> 35:32.208
must help this collective
and must nourish it.

35:33.783 --> 35:36.232
As you know, I was
telling him also

35:36.520 --> 35:39.151
that he, if he has
problem with money,

35:39.451 --> 35:42.132
we can give money
from Cabella

35:42.432 --> 35:44.613
because before that I used
to travel on My own.

35:44.882 --> 35:48.807
Even to Greece, I came on
My own, and paid for everything.

35:49.069 --> 35:52.375
So, see also, then Stomatis
had to pay something,

35:52.688 --> 35:55.275
which I didn't like very much.
He was paying so much,

35:55.549 --> 35:57.350
because we had such
a small group.

35:57.625 --> 36:01.163
But now as you have a big
group, you feel responsible,

36:01.462 --> 36:03.788
you want to pay for it.
All right, doesn't matter.

36:04.087 --> 36:09.855
But not to pay for your Sahaja
Yoga, not for your realization,

36:10.129 --> 36:14.473
not for knowledge of Sahaja
Yoga. This is there.

36:14.754 --> 36:18.110
And so people will start putting
ideas into your heads that,

36:18.372 --> 36:20.435
Why this? Why that?",
and all that.

36:20.691 --> 36:23.540
Such people you should keep
out because you are here

36:23.827 --> 36:26.277
to develop your spirituality
and not to listen

36:26.546 --> 36:29.065
to these stupid people who
have been troublesome.

36:29.321 --> 36:32.577
So best is to keep
to your own,

36:33.264 --> 36:38.157
own development and own
nourishment. It's very important.

36:38.858 --> 36:42.545
So it is in a way collective,
but also individual,

36:42.825 --> 36:45.722
because what you're
gaining out of the collective

36:46.028 --> 36:48.259
you should be on the watch
out, you should see for yourself

36:48.553 --> 36:50.697
what you are gaining
out of the collective.

36:50.997 --> 36:53.515
Then secondly, at home, you
must every day, every day,

36:53.815 --> 36:57.633
every day, again I say,
not to miss it out,

36:57.952 --> 37:02.599
in the evening before sleeping
you must have meditation.

37:02.886 --> 37:05.381
You can wash
yourself up, like,

37:05.693 --> 37:07.656
what you call, the water
treatment or anything

37:07.923 --> 37:09.872
then sit down for meditation
for ten minutes.

37:10.185 --> 37:13.477
You must give fifteen minutes to
yourself and then sleep off.

37:13.765 --> 37:16.340
Supposing you can't do
one night, doesn't matter,

37:16.627 --> 37:19.970
but try to do it every
night. If not possible,

37:20.239 --> 37:22.427
if you don't do it one night,
you can do it in the morning.

37:22.726 --> 37:26.226
But it's very important. I can
easily make out a person

37:26.513 --> 37:29.751
who does meditation and
who does not do meditation.

37:30.138 --> 37:34.850
It's a difference, such a difference.
I immediately know a person

37:35.175 --> 37:40.075
who is meditating
everyday, in his health,

37:40.367 --> 37:44.899
in his face, in his behavior,
in everything, he's very different.

37:45.228 --> 37:48.396
And those who do not do
any meditation you'll find,

37:48.670 --> 37:52.596
not only that they are funny,
but their children are funny,

37:52.896 --> 37:56.775
their relationships are
funny, everything is funny.

37:57.124 --> 38:01.149
So the meditation is
a very important part for you.

38:01.568 --> 38:03.886
Because also the women
who are pregnant, when they,

38:04.186 --> 38:06.636
if they do not meditate
their children turn out

38:06.924 --> 38:11.699
to be very troublesome and very
funny. It's a thing like that.

38:12.043 --> 38:16.468
It effects everything. But your
character of meditativeness,

38:16.736 --> 38:22.516
your character of Sahaja Yoga
helps everyone, your children,

38:22.853 --> 38:25.185
your family, your society,
everybody,

38:25.441 --> 38:29.084
and everybody can make it out
what sort of a family you are,

38:29.391 --> 38:32.728
what sort of a people you are,
what sort of a personality you are.

38:32.984 --> 38:34.941
And from you they
take to Sahaja Yoga.

38:35.215 --> 38:40.884
So is important in individual life
also just to meditate, nothing else.

38:41.497 --> 38:46.190
You have to come to a state
of thoughtless awareness.

38:46.496 --> 38:49.040
So the mantra is, as
you know, Nirvichara.

38:49.296 --> 38:51.358
You should use the
mantra of Nirvichara

38:51.632 --> 38:53.814
for coming to the
state of thoughtlessness

38:54.077 --> 38:56.228
and try to increase
this area,

38:56.546 --> 38:58.426
this space of thoughtless
awareness

38:58.714 --> 39:02.807
and that is how you will find
you will be growing very much.

39:03.301 --> 39:07.325
Now as you get lots of powers,
as you get lots of people

39:07.657 --> 39:10.343
being realized by you,
curing by you,

39:10.599 --> 39:13.128
sometimes maybe it
might affect your ego.

39:13.377 --> 39:17.640
You might get into ego things.
For such people, I have to say

39:17.928 --> 39:20.928
that you have to be introspective
and see for yourself.

39:21.221 --> 39:23.746
You face the mirror and ask
now how much ego you have.

39:24.046 --> 39:27.202
Laugh at yourself. Once you
start laughing at yourself,

39:27.477 --> 39:29.932
your ego will drop out
and you'll understand

39:30.189 --> 39:34.189
that it was false to have this
kind of ego within you.

39:34.475 --> 39:37.718
There are so many ways and methods
of finding out about yourself.

39:38.007 --> 39:41.275
Put yourself into bandhan and put
your hands towards the photograph,

39:41.550 --> 39:43.988
immediately you can feel what
chakras are catching

39:44.295 --> 39:48.288
and you know how to clear it out.
Also sometimes you feel it inside.

39:48.557 --> 39:50.971
If your chakras are catching,
you can feel it inside

39:51.272 --> 39:56.368
and you can feel it,
the different centers

39:56.637 --> 39:58.980
on your fingertips
about yourself.

39:59.261 --> 40:03.654
So it is about yourself you will
know. About others, you know,

40:03.929 --> 40:06.028
you should just talk on
chakras. You should not say,

40:06.301 --> 40:09.203
he's bhootish, or he has ego
- nothing. But you should say,

40:09.466 --> 40:12.709
his Agnya is catching,
means he has got ego.

40:13.028 --> 40:15.984
You can say, his Nabhi's bad,
his, this thing is bad.

40:16.246 --> 40:17.914
So the language is
to change now.

40:18.189 --> 40:23.239
We have to talk in the
language of Sahaja Yoga.

40:23.939 --> 40:27.795
It is to be understood that
now we are Sahaja Yogis.

40:28.082 --> 40:31.319
We've got the powers
we have vibratory powers.

40:31.599 --> 40:36.211
But if you don't use these vibratory
powers, what is going to happen?

40:37.018 --> 40:39.024
We have to use them,
that's the point.

40:39.268 --> 40:41.455
We always forget. I've
seen, the other day

40:41.733 --> 40:43.586
they couldn't open something.
I said, "Give a bandhan."

40:43.867 --> 40:46.260
Gave a bandhan and immediately
it worked out, you see.

40:46.529 --> 40:48.496
Small, small things also
you'll be surprised

40:48.760 --> 40:50.591
that if it doesn't work out, you have
to just give a bandhan

40:50.836 --> 40:52.302
and it works out.

40:52.641 --> 40:55.003
It is important to know
that you are Sahaja Yogis,

40:55.291 --> 40:57.928
you are saints and that
you can do lots of things

40:58.209 --> 41:00.472
and you shouldn't forget it.
You shouldn't forget it

41:00.722 --> 41:03.740
that you are Sahaja Yogis. Now
you are no more ordinary people.

41:04.015 --> 41:06.533
You are saints now and
you can do a lot.

41:06.815 --> 41:10.783
All this, when it works out,
you'll be amazed at yourself how,

41:11.077 --> 41:13.958
how you have achieved
all these things.

41:14.281 --> 41:17.419
And, I tell you, people tell Me
that they look like roses,

41:17.694 --> 41:20.489
all of their faces shining,
they look so beautiful and

41:20.791 --> 41:22.846
they can make it out that
you are Sahaja Yogis.

41:23.159 --> 41:25.568
I've seen at the airport
also many people say that,

41:25.863 --> 41:27.250
"Who were those people

41:27.551 --> 41:32.426
looking so sweet and beautiful,
shining. Who were those?"

41:32.785 --> 41:35.491
So if I tell them that they
are saints, they won't believe

41:35.785 --> 41:38.241
that there could be so
many saints, but there are

41:38.517 --> 41:40.841
and we have achieved
that all over the world.

41:41.116 --> 41:43.410
All over the world now there
are so many Sahaja Yogis

41:43.691 --> 41:47.762
that I can't even say how many they
are, in thousands and thousands.

41:48.082 --> 41:50.242
So, I again tell
you that Greece

41:50.509 --> 41:52.577
is a place where
you can do a lot.

41:52.858 --> 41:55.870
First of all, you must establish
yourself in Sahaja Yoga

41:56.127 --> 41:59.295
and you have to
know what you are,

41:59.577 --> 42:02.014
all the time to remember what
you are. You are a Sahaja Yogi.

42:02.301 --> 42:04.513
Even to children, you have
to say, "You are a Sahaja Yogi,"

42:04.789 --> 42:07.556
so they also develop that
personality by which

42:07.868 --> 42:10.731
they behave properly and
they behave in a manner

42:11.044 --> 42:13.805
that a Sahaja Yogi
should behave.

42:14.912 --> 42:19.962
So all these things are just
the preliminaries of Sahaja Yoga,

42:20.249 --> 42:24.061
but I am sure you must be
getting my tapes from Cabella

42:24.300 --> 42:27.174
and you must be knowing
about all the deeper things

42:27.455 --> 42:29.922
about yourself and
about Sahaja Yoga.

42:30.205 --> 42:34.029
It's a new age
that has started.

42:34.330 --> 42:37.630
The other day I said that the
Satya Yuga has started now.

42:37.973 --> 42:40.366
So it will start exposing
all that is a-satya,

42:40.673 --> 42:43.309
which is whatever is false.
All those who are false people

42:43.603 --> 42:47.746
will be exposed and you'll
be amazed at the way

42:48.052 --> 42:52.451
things will work out. And it's
such a great time you are born

42:52.781 --> 42:55.900
and it's such a great thing that
you have come to Sahaja Yoga

42:56.188 --> 42:58.059
and that you have
got your realization

42:58.309 --> 43:00.326
and that you are
one of those

43:00.638 --> 43:05.595
who have to lift the whole of this
universe into a higher awareness.

43:05.888 --> 43:07.900
Of course, we can't say
how many will be saved.

43:08.188 --> 43:12.088
It's another point because
what I know about is that

43:12.369 --> 43:16.999
in the evolutionary portion,
supposing we came from chimpanzees,

43:17.267 --> 43:20.224
many were lost
in between, you know,

43:20.524 --> 43:24.274
and there are so many
chimpanzees now left

43:24.580 --> 43:27.217
and there's the middle,
the people were lost.

43:27.504 --> 43:29.447
In the same way, many
human beings may be lost

43:29.735 --> 43:33.808
because of their stupidity, because
of their self-destructive habits

43:34.087 --> 43:36.310
that they have formed.

43:36.673 --> 43:38.554
But your responsibility
is very great.

43:38.779 --> 43:41.660
Don't think, I am just mediocre.
I'm good for nothing.

43:41.916 --> 43:43.285
Never. Never think
like that.

43:43.563 --> 43:47.328
You are all saints and you
are capable of great things.

43:47.647 --> 43:50.165
May God bless you.

43:54.309 --> 43:57.246
So today they want to
do the puja of Athena

43:57.616 --> 44:00.477
And you will be surprised
that the names of Athena

44:00.766 --> 44:06.252
are exactly about the same as
that of the Goddess, of Adi Shakti.

44:06.540 --> 44:09.533
Is very surprising, they
have such beautiful names.

44:09.840 --> 44:13.765
But we can have hundred
and eight names of… today

44:14.013 --> 44:16.918
and you can read the
names and the meanings

44:17.181 --> 44:19.162
and they can
say the mantras.

44:19.469 --> 44:21.931
But first the children
have to wash My feet

44:22.206 --> 44:25.543
with Ganesha stuti,
you can sing

44:25.981 --> 44:27.723
Ganesha stuti.

44:28.049 --> 44:32.766
You've got some musical
instrument or not?

44:33.110 --> 44:36.098
Yes, yes.
You have.
