00:14:06.118 --> 00:14:20.860
I welcome all the sahaja yogis from abroad
to this great country of yoga.

00:14:25.915 --> 00:14:32.121
It gives me immense pleasure; I have
no words to express,

00:14:32.146 --> 00:14:40.473
to see sahaja yogis coming from
all over the world,

00:14:40.498 --> 00:14:49.066
all over the country to celebrate this
special occasion today.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:58.385
It’s so auspicious today that you all
should be here;

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:06.125
because you are the chosen ones,
the soldiers

00:15:07.244 --> 00:15:18.604
who are going to fight till Satya Yuga
is established on this earth.

00:15:20.172 --> 00:15:23.592
Is the day of revolution.

00:15:24.216 --> 00:15:30.147
San-krant means: san means, you know,
auspicious, krant means revolution.

00:15:30.172 --> 00:15:34.396
Today is the day of holy revolution.

00:15:34.421 --> 00:15:41.278
I’ve told you about the rebellion that
in rebellion we move in a pendulum

00:15:41.303 --> 00:15:49.282
from one to another end as a result
of inertia.

00:15:50.219 --> 00:15:54.842
But through the ascent,

00:15:58.218 --> 00:16:05.256
when we achieve a higher state, it’s only
possible when there is a revolution

00:16:05.281 --> 00:16:10.562
and revolution takes spirally. The movement
has to be spiral

00:16:10.587 --> 00:16:15.983
to land up at a higher position.
So this is the revolution

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:18.972
which is the holy revolution.

00:16:18.997 --> 00:16:26.135
We have known of many revolutions so far;
we have had revolutions in our country.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:30.474
In other western countries also we have
had revolution

00:16:30.499 --> 00:16:38.879
on the political grounds, on the grounds
of disparities.

00:16:38.904 --> 00:16:44.671
Many other things have been fought
through revolution,

00:16:44.696 --> 00:16:51.997
but still, the ascent has not been
achieved within.

00:16:52.022 --> 00:16:58.824
I am talking about the revolution
within ourselves.

00:16:58.849 --> 00:17:07.292
In this revolution you are very much helped
by your own Mother, the Kundalini,

00:17:07.317 --> 00:17:15.194
and you evolve in a very sweet manner;

00:17:15.219 --> 00:17:23.277
in a spiral ascent to land up as realized
souls.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:31.580
You have been very kind to come to this
country

00:17:31.605 --> 00:17:36.316
because this country does not have
the comforts

00:17:36.341 --> 00:17:41.048
and the facilities you have in your
own country;

00:17:41.073 --> 00:17:45.588
so one has to be prepared for
the roughing out,

00:17:45.613 --> 00:17:50.180
which may be difficult for some people
to do so.

00:17:50.205 --> 00:17:55.487
I had to buy a present for some gentleman
when I came to Bombay

00:17:55.512 --> 00:18:00.233
and I thought what should I buy? I’d better
go and buy some ivory piece for him.

00:18:00.258 --> 00:18:04.636
So I went to the shop, and I got
a beautiful ivory piece

00:18:04.661 --> 00:18:11.647
called hitopadesh where Shri Krishna
is sitting on a beautiful chariot of ivory

00:18:11.672 --> 00:18:22.490
and giving the hitopadesh, the sermon
of Gita to Arjuna.

00:18:22.515 --> 00:18:28.406
It was very easy to buy; it took only half
an hour for me to go and buy the thing.

00:18:28.431 --> 00:18:34.743
But to buy the wrapping paper I had
to waste two hours in Bombay.

00:18:34.768 --> 00:18:38.081
Because you can’t get a sensible wrapping
paper here;

00:18:38.106 --> 00:18:43.177
and then the ribbon and then the flowers,
is an impossible situation.

00:18:43.202 --> 00:18:45.330
So I didn’t know what to do.

00:18:45.355 --> 00:18:50.346
I got absolutely, according to my husband,
a third class wrapping paper.

00:18:50.371 --> 00:18:54.504
I brought it back home; he said,
“You can’t wrap with this nonsense;

00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:59.439
it looks so horrid.” I said, “Now,
if you want, I can get silk to wrap it

00:18:59.464 --> 00:19:03.654
in this country, but a wrapping paper
is a problem.”

00:19:03.679 --> 00:19:07.242
So when the gentleman was presented,
I told him very frankly,

00:19:07.267 --> 00:19:11.024
"I’m sorry, in Bombay I couldn’t get
a good wrapping paper,

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:16.584
but ivory I’ve brought for you", and he was
so enamored by the present.

00:19:16.609 --> 00:19:20.952
So in this country, you have to see that
we can get ivory,

00:19:20.977 --> 00:19:23.717
but we cannot get wrapping paper.

00:19:23.742 --> 00:19:28.779
And those who are used to wrapping paper
find it difficult to adjust

00:19:28.804 --> 00:19:32.850
because we are used to convenience
of wrapping paper.

00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:43.461
So one has to realize that the wrapping
paper, of which we are so much

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:52.043
fond of or we are used to, is of no
importance;

00:19:52.068 --> 00:19:56.197
while you cannot get ivory in the western
countries.

00:19:56.222 --> 00:20:00.161
If you have to get an ivory piece,
I don’t know,

00:20:00.186 --> 00:20:03.316
you’ll have to move for years together
to an ivory piece,

00:20:03.341 --> 00:20:07.107
but the wrapping paper you can get it
in five minutes.

00:20:07.132 --> 00:20:11.688
So one has to realize this is a country,
if you have to know about it,

00:20:11.713 --> 00:20:15.836
you have to go deep down into it.

00:20:15.861 --> 00:20:20.033
You have to develop a deeper understanding
of this country.

00:20:20.058 --> 00:20:24.850
If you see the bathrooms and if you see
the roads, if you see the houses

00:20:24.875 --> 00:20:30.947
all black, dark, dirty, according to
all the, all the common standards of life.

00:20:30.972 --> 00:20:36.457
Forget it; forget it.

00:20:36.482 --> 00:20:41.393
You have not come here to see this, that
all you can see in your own country,

00:20:41.418 --> 00:20:46.704
and you have seen it. But what you have
come to see here is the depth,

00:20:46.729 --> 00:20:51.392
the love, the affection, the human beings.

00:20:52.869 --> 00:21:01.239
And you’ll be very happy because
you’ll find very rare experiences,

00:21:01.264 --> 00:21:09.142
which will really enthrall you with joyous
memories for all your life.

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:17.327
Also, this country, especially Maharashtra,
is a special country

00:21:17.352 --> 00:21:22.789
because the Kundalini of the universe
resides

00:21:22.814 --> 00:21:33.060
in this triangular plane. Or we can say
this is the atta:

00:21:33.085 --> 00:21:39.973
the triangular raised platform,

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:49.180
and hence the vibrations in this country,
this part of the country, are very great.

00:21:49.205 --> 00:21:55.168
Now, to come to for Maha Yoga, as the Sahaja
Yoga today has become Maha Yoga,

00:21:55.193 --> 00:22:00.531
you have to come to Maharashtra.
Maharashtra is the great nation.

00:22:00.556 --> 00:22:07.416
So I’m sure you are expecting lot of things
to happen to you,

00:22:07.441 --> 00:22:12.736
but keep your minds open because
it’s a revolution.

00:22:12.761 --> 00:22:19.967
It’s not just a pendulum that from comfort
you are coming to discomfort.

00:22:19.992 --> 00:22:27.898
One thing you have to realize, it has
nothing to do like an anti-culture stuff.

00:22:27.923 --> 00:22:38.240
You have come here to jump into your
subtler and subtler sensitivities;

00:22:38.265 --> 00:22:44.606
so the grosser sensitivities must be
neglected and negated

00:22:44.631 --> 00:22:50.694
so that you can feel your subtler
sensitivities.

00:22:50.719 --> 00:22:56.056
Once you start understanding this basic
principle of enjoying here,

00:22:56.081 --> 00:23:06.690
I’m sure the whole venture will be
extremely fruitful.

00:23:06.715 --> 00:23:13.531
Because all over the world we realize
that Sahaja Yoga

00:23:13.556 --> 00:23:20.226
is the only way for human emancipation;
is the only way

00:23:20.251 --> 00:23:27.138
we are going to transform this world
into a beautiful place.

00:23:28.217 --> 00:23:39.261
For that we have to get into a proper
understanding geared up;

00:23:39.286 --> 00:23:43.612
absolutely like soldiers into a disciplined
life,

00:23:43.637 --> 00:23:55.318
so that whatever we want to do, we can do
in our optimum capacities.

00:23:55.343 --> 00:24:02.068
So to allow your full capacities
to manifest, try to negate,

00:24:02.093 --> 00:24:08.449
to overlook your gross sensitivities,
whichever come in-between.

00:24:08.474 --> 00:24:12.892
You have to cut it short sometimes.
You’ll have to get up early in the morning;

00:24:12.917 --> 00:24:18.497
you’ll have to bathe in a funny way,
and it will be a difficult thing.

00:24:18.522 --> 00:24:26.939
But if you try to adjust with this
noble idea

00:24:26.964 --> 00:24:37.212
that you are a part and parcel
of the great Virat.

00:24:37.237 --> 00:24:42.482
And that you all have to join together
in such a way

00:24:42.507 --> 00:24:47.740
that in your sensitivity you become
equally the same;

00:24:47.765 --> 00:24:51.154
that you understand each other
very well.

00:24:51.179 --> 00:25:00.236
I’m sure you will enjoy the love and
hospitality of your hosts here.

00:25:00.261 --> 00:25:05.762
This revolution starts on such a day
today I’m very happy.

00:25:05.787 --> 00:25:09.997
So we have to have the revolution
acceptable to us.

00:25:10.022 --> 00:25:14.119
You know, when French revolution took place,
how people lived;

00:25:14.144 --> 00:25:18.185
when in this country people fought
for their freedom, how they lived.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:24.857
I know, My father sacrificed every single
farthing he had;

00:25:24.882 --> 00:25:30.407
he, we had to live in huts while we lived
in very great comforts ourselves.

00:25:30.432 --> 00:25:35.214
He sacrificed everything. My mother
went to jail five times.

00:25:35.246 --> 00:25:39.773
My father went to jail three times, and
every time he was in the jail

00:25:39.798 --> 00:25:45.001
for not less than two to three years. So
you can imagine, with so many children,

00:25:45.026 --> 00:25:50.593
how they sacrificed everything that
they had to achieve this freedom.

00:25:50.618 --> 00:25:54.400
Now if you have to achieve the freedom
of the spirit

00:25:54.425 --> 00:26:00.561
we must have the sense of sacrifice. But
it doesn’t mean sacrifice with complaint;

00:26:00.586 --> 00:26:07.444
but sacrifice that can be enjoyed,
sacrifice of which you have to be proud,

00:26:07.469 --> 00:26:17.136
sacrifice that you don’t feel, sacrifice
that ennobles you.

00:26:17.161 --> 00:26:21.878
That is the spirit with which this
revolution has to take place.

00:26:21.903 --> 00:26:25.818
So far, if you know, we have not sacrificed
anything.

00:26:25.843 --> 00:26:31.072
Of course, ego and all these nonsensical
things you have sacrificed, no doubt,

00:26:31.097 --> 00:26:37.848
but that you never wanted in any way;
none of you liked that ego.

00:26:37.873 --> 00:26:45.026
Even Indians had to sacrifice a lot,
they have given up many habits

00:26:45.051 --> 00:26:53.621
which are very deterrent or injurious
to healthy growth of this nation.

00:26:53.646 --> 00:26:59.474
As sahaja yogis they have also come up
so high,

00:26:59.499 --> 00:27:08.746
they have become very honest, extremely
sweet and hospitable people.

00:27:08.771 --> 00:27:14.602
In the same way, I would say that
My children abroad

00:27:14.627 --> 00:27:21.198
have really done marvelous feats
to give up some things,

00:27:21.223 --> 00:27:25.856
which I thought will be difficult for them
to give up.

00:27:25.881 --> 00:27:31.861
They have changed their moral values, they
have accepted a very strict moral code.

00:27:31.886 --> 00:27:35.133
And they enjoy that morality and that
virtue.

00:27:35.158 --> 00:27:38.587
I don’t know how to congratulate you
for this.

00:27:38.612 --> 00:27:44.659
You may say, "Mother, your love has
done it", but I just don’t know.

00:27:44.684 --> 00:27:50.514
I think it’s your own capacities,
your purvo janmas sanchitas;

00:27:50.539 --> 00:27:56.111
whatever you have earned in your previous
lives has done all this.

00:27:56.136 --> 00:28:01.214
Otherwise, it is impossible even to change
one person.

00:28:01.239 --> 00:28:05.747
All this change has come for the good,
for the enjoyment and happiness.

00:28:05.772 --> 00:28:09.515
You don’t have to change much more;
you don’t have to change,

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:15.816
but now you have to enjoy the change.
And the enjoyment of the change comes

00:28:15.841 --> 00:28:22.116
when all the tags that you have from India,
from east or from west,

00:28:22.141 --> 00:28:27.505
are pulling you down; just throw them away
and come up.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:36.582
All of you together should enjoy together
the joy and the bliss of your Father.

00:28:36.607 --> 00:28:42.929
So today is a great day. This sankramana
that has started

00:28:42.954 --> 00:28:48.198
requires serious effort.

00:28:48.223 --> 00:28:53.927
We cannot play about with that.
It's very great emergency.

00:28:53.952 --> 00:28:58.285
I can feel in the atmosphere
the emergency:

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:05.229
all the Gods and Goddesses are there
to help you to work it out.

00:29:05.254 --> 00:29:10.581
You are on the stage and you have
to create

00:29:10.606 --> 00:29:15.514
that great drama of revolution.

00:29:15.539 --> 00:29:21.849
We have to show to this world that
it’s only the spirit

00:29:21.874 --> 00:29:26.408
that can save the world, nothing else.

00:29:26.433 --> 00:29:31.841
And so, from today we start our journey

00:29:31.866 --> 00:29:38.295
towards that subtlety and that sensitivity,
which you can feel;

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:43.635
which you can feel Nirananda. Nirananda,
your Mothers name is Nira,

00:29:43.660 --> 00:29:49.347
and at Sahasrara, you feel the ananda,
the joy of Nira.

00:29:49.372 --> 00:29:52.114
May God bless you.
