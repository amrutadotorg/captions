14:06.118 --> 14:20.860
I welcome all the sahaja yogis from abroad
to this great country of yoga.

14:25.915 --> 14:32.121
It gives me immense pleasure; I have
no words to express,

14:32.146 --> 14:40.473
to see sahaja yogis coming from
all over the world,

14:40.498 --> 14:49.066
all over the country to celebrate this
special occasion today.

14:51.670 --> 14:58.385
It’s so auspicious today that you all
should be here;

14:58.410 --> 15:06.125
because you are the chosen ones,
the soldiers

15:07.244 --> 15:18.604
who are going to fight till Satya Yuga
is established on this earth.

15:20.172 --> 15:23.592
Is the day of revolution.

15:24.216 --> 15:30.147
San-krant means: san means, you know,
auspicious, krant means revolution.

15:30.172 --> 15:34.396
Today is the day of holy revolution.

15:34.421 --> 15:41.278
I’ve told you about the rebellion that
in rebellion we move in a pendulum

15:41.303 --> 15:49.282
from one to another end as a result
of inertia.

15:50.219 --> 15:54.842
But through the ascent,

15:58.218 --> 16:05.256
when we achieve a higher state, it’s only
possible when there is a revolution

16:05.281 --> 16:10.562
and revolution takes spirally. The movement
has to be spiral

16:10.587 --> 16:15.983
to land up at a higher position.
So this is the revolution

16:16.008 --> 16:18.972
which is the holy revolution.

16:18.997 --> 16:26.135
We have known of many revolutions so far;
we have had revolutions in our country.

16:26.160 --> 16:30.474
In other western countries also we have
had revolution

16:30.499 --> 16:38.879
on the political grounds, on the grounds
of disparities.

16:38.904 --> 16:44.671
Many other things have been fought
through revolution,

16:44.696 --> 16:51.997
but still, the ascent has not been
achieved within.

16:52.022 --> 16:58.824
I am talking about the revolution
within ourselves.

16:58.849 --> 17:07.292
In this revolution you are very much helped
by your own Mother, the Kundalini,

17:07.317 --> 17:15.194
and you evolve in a very sweet manner;

17:15.219 --> 17:23.277
in a spiral ascent to land up as realized
souls.

17:25.050 --> 17:31.580
You have been very kind to come to this
country

17:31.605 --> 17:36.316
because this country does not have
the comforts

17:36.341 --> 17:41.048
and the facilities you have in your
own country;

17:41.073 --> 17:45.588
so one has to be prepared for
the roughing out,

17:45.613 --> 17:50.180
which may be difficult for some people
to do so.

17:50.205 --> 17:55.487
I had to buy a present for some gentleman
when I came to Bombay

17:55.512 --> 18:00.233
and I thought what should I buy? I’d better
go and buy some ivory piece for him.

18:00.258 --> 18:04.636
So I went to the shop, and I got
a beautiful ivory piece

18:04.661 --> 18:11.647
called hitopadesh where Shri Krishna
is sitting on a beautiful chariot of ivory

18:11.672 --> 18:22.490
and giving the hitopadesh, the sermon
of Gita to Arjuna.

18:22.515 --> 18:28.406
It was very easy to buy; it took only half
an hour for me to go and buy the thing.

18:28.431 --> 18:34.743
But to buy the wrapping paper I had
to waste two hours in Bombay.

18:34.768 --> 18:38.081
Because you can’t get a sensible wrapping
paper here;

18:38.106 --> 18:43.177
and then the ribbon and then the flowers,
is an impossible situation.

18:43.202 --> 18:45.330
So I didn’t know what to do.

18:45.355 --> 18:50.346
I got absolutely, according to my husband,
a third class wrapping paper.

18:50.371 --> 18:54.504
I brought it back home; he said,
“You can’t wrap with this nonsense;

18:54.529 --> 18:59.439
it looks so horrid.” I said, “Now,
if you want, I can get silk to wrap it

18:59.464 --> 19:03.654
in this country, but a wrapping paper
is a problem.”

19:03.679 --> 19:07.242
So when the gentleman was presented,
I told him very frankly,

19:07.267 --> 19:11.024
"I’m sorry, in Bombay I couldn’t get
a good wrapping paper,

19:11.049 --> 19:16.584
but ivory I’ve brought for you", and he was
so enamored by the present.

19:16.609 --> 19:20.952
So in this country, you have to see that
we can get ivory,

19:20.977 --> 19:23.717
but we cannot get wrapping paper.

19:23.742 --> 19:28.779
And those who are used to wrapping paper
find it difficult to adjust

19:28.804 --> 19:32.850
because we are used to convenience
of wrapping paper.

19:32.875 --> 19:43.461
So one has to realize that the wrapping
paper, of which we are so much

19:46.952 --> 19:52.043
fond of or we are used to, is of no
importance;

19:52.068 --> 19:56.197
while you cannot get ivory in the western
countries.

19:56.222 --> 20:00.161
If you have to get an ivory piece,
I don’t know,

20:00.186 --> 20:03.316
you’ll have to move for years together
to an ivory piece,

20:03.341 --> 20:07.107
but the wrapping paper you can get it
in five minutes.

20:07.132 --> 20:11.688
So one has to realize this is a country,
if you have to know about it,

20:11.713 --> 20:15.836
you have to go deep down into it.

20:15.861 --> 20:20.033
You have to develop a deeper understanding
of this country.

20:20.058 --> 20:24.850
If you see the bathrooms and if you see
the roads, if you see the houses

20:24.875 --> 20:30.947
all black, dark, dirty, according to
all the, all the common standards of life.

20:30.972 --> 20:36.457
Forget it; forget it.

20:36.482 --> 20:41.393
You have not come here to see this, that
all you can see in your own country,

20:41.418 --> 20:46.704
and you have seen it. But what you have
come to see here is the depth,

20:46.729 --> 20:51.392
the love, the affection, the human beings.

20:52.869 --> 21:01.239
And you’ll be very happy because
you’ll find very rare experiences,

21:01.264 --> 21:09.142
which will really enthrall you with joyous
memories for all your life.

21:09.167 --> 21:17.327
Also, this country, especially Maharashtra,
is a special country

21:17.352 --> 21:22.789
because the Kundalini of the universe
resides

21:22.814 --> 21:33.060
in this triangular plane. Or we can say
this is the atta:

21:33.085 --> 21:39.973
the triangular raised platform,

21:39.998 --> 21:49.180
and hence the vibrations in this country,
this part of the country, are very great.

21:49.205 --> 21:55.168
Now, to come to for Maha Yoga, as the Sahaja
Yoga today has become Maha Yoga,

21:55.193 --> 22:00.531
you have to come to Maharashtra.
Maharashtra is the great nation.

22:00.556 --> 22:07.416
So I’m sure you are expecting lot of things
to happen to you,

22:07.441 --> 22:12.736
but keep your minds open because
it’s a revolution.

22:12.761 --> 22:19.967
It’s not just a pendulum that from comfort
you are coming to discomfort.

22:19.992 --> 22:27.898
One thing you have to realize, it has
nothing to do like an anti-culture stuff.

22:27.923 --> 22:38.240
You have come here to jump into your
subtler and subtler sensitivities;

22:38.265 --> 22:44.606
so the grosser sensitivities must be
neglected and negated

22:44.631 --> 22:50.694
so that you can feel your subtler
sensitivities.

22:50.719 --> 22:56.056
Once you start understanding this basic
principle of enjoying here,

22:56.081 --> 23:06.690
I’m sure the whole venture will be
extremely fruitful.

23:06.715 --> 23:13.531
Because all over the world we realize
that Sahaja Yoga

23:13.556 --> 23:20.226
is the only way for human emancipation;
is the only way

23:20.251 --> 23:27.138
we are going to transform this world
into a beautiful place.

23:28.217 --> 23:39.261
For that we have to get into a proper
understanding geared up;

23:39.286 --> 23:43.612
absolutely like soldiers into a disciplined
life,

23:43.637 --> 23:55.318
so that whatever we want to do, we can do
in our optimum capacities.

23:55.343 --> 24:02.068
So to allow your full capacities
to manifest, try to negate,

24:02.093 --> 24:08.449
to overlook your gross sensitivities,
whichever come in-between.

24:08.474 --> 24:12.892
You have to cut it short sometimes.
You’ll have to get up early in the morning;

24:12.917 --> 24:18.497
you’ll have to bathe in a funny way,
and it will be a difficult thing.

24:18.522 --> 24:26.939
But if you try to adjust with this
noble idea

24:26.964 --> 24:37.212
that you are a part and parcel
of the great Virat.

24:37.237 --> 24:42.482
And that you all have to join together
in such a way

24:42.507 --> 24:47.740
that in your sensitivity you become
equally the same;

24:47.765 --> 24:51.154
that you understand each other
very well.

24:51.179 --> 25:00.236
I’m sure you will enjoy the love and
hospitality of your hosts here.

25:00.261 --> 25:05.762
This revolution starts on such a day
today I’m very happy.

25:05.787 --> 25:09.997
So we have to have the revolution
acceptable to us.

25:10.022 --> 25:14.119
You know, when French revolution took place,
how people lived;

25:14.144 --> 25:18.185
when in this country people fought
for their freedom, how they lived.

25:18.210 --> 25:24.857
I know, My father sacrificed every single
farthing he had;

25:24.882 --> 25:30.407
he, we had to live in huts while we lived
in very great comforts ourselves.

25:30.432 --> 25:35.214
He sacrificed everything. My mother
went to jail five times.

25:35.246 --> 25:39.773
My father went to jail three times, and
every time he was in the jail

25:39.798 --> 25:45.001
for not less than two to three years. So
you can imagine, with so many children,

25:45.026 --> 25:50.593
how they sacrificed everything that
they had to achieve this freedom.

25:50.618 --> 25:54.400
Now if you have to achieve the freedom
of the spirit

25:54.425 --> 26:00.561
we must have the sense of sacrifice. But
it doesn’t mean sacrifice with complaint;

26:00.586 --> 26:07.444
but sacrifice that can be enjoyed,
sacrifice of which you have to be proud,

26:07.469 --> 26:17.136
sacrifice that you don’t feel, sacrifice
that ennobles you.

26:17.161 --> 26:21.878
That is the spirit with which this
revolution has to take place.

26:21.903 --> 26:25.818
So far, if you know, we have not sacrificed
anything.

26:25.843 --> 26:31.072
Of course, ego and all these nonsensical
things you have sacrificed, no doubt,

26:31.097 --> 26:37.848
but that you never wanted in any way;
none of you liked that ego.

26:37.873 --> 26:45.026
Even Indians had to sacrifice a lot,
they have given up many habits

26:45.051 --> 26:53.621
which are very deterrent or injurious
to healthy growth of this nation.

26:53.646 --> 26:59.474
As sahaja yogis they have also come up
so high,

26:59.499 --> 27:08.746
they have become very honest, extremely
sweet and hospitable people.

27:08.771 --> 27:14.602
In the same way, I would say that
My children abroad

27:14.627 --> 27:21.198
have really done marvelous feats
to give up some things,

27:21.223 --> 27:25.856
which I thought will be difficult for them
to give up.

27:25.881 --> 27:31.861
They have changed their moral values, they
have accepted a very strict moral code.

27:31.886 --> 27:35.133
And they enjoy that morality and that
virtue.

27:35.158 --> 27:38.587
I don’t know how to congratulate you
for this.

27:38.612 --> 27:44.659
You may say, "Mother, your love has
done it", but I just don’t know.

27:44.684 --> 27:50.514
I think it’s your own capacities,
your purvo janmas sanchitas;

27:50.539 --> 27:56.111
whatever you have earned in your previous
lives has done all this.

27:56.136 --> 28:01.214
Otherwise, it is impossible even to change
one person.

28:01.239 --> 28:05.747
All this change has come for the good,
for the enjoyment and happiness.

28:05.772 --> 28:09.515
You don’t have to change much more;
you don’t have to change,

28:09.540 --> 28:15.816
but now you have to enjoy the change.
And the enjoyment of the change comes

28:15.841 --> 28:22.116
when all the tags that you have from India,
from east or from west,

28:22.141 --> 28:27.505
are pulling you down; just throw them away
and come up.

28:27.530 --> 28:36.582
All of you together should enjoy together
the joy and the bliss of your Father.

28:36.607 --> 28:42.929
So today is a great day. This sankramana
that has started

28:42.954 --> 28:48.198
requires serious effort.

28:48.223 --> 28:53.927
We cannot play about with that.
It's very great emergency.

28:53.952 --> 28:58.285
I can feel in the atmosphere
the emergency:

28:58.310 --> 29:05.229
all the Gods and Goddesses are there
to help you to work it out.

29:05.254 --> 29:10.581
You are on the stage and you have
to create

29:10.606 --> 29:15.514
that great drama of revolution.

29:15.539 --> 29:21.849
We have to show to this world that
it’s only the spirit

29:21.874 --> 29:26.408
that can save the world, nothing else.

29:26.433 --> 29:31.841
And so, from today we start our journey

29:31.866 --> 29:38.295
towards that subtlety and that sensitivity,
which you can feel;

29:38.320 --> 29:43.635
which you can feel Nirananda. Nirananda,
your Mothers name is Nira,

29:43.660 --> 29:49.347
and at Sahasrara, you feel the ananda,
the joy of Nira.

29:49.372 --> 29:52.114
May God bless you.
