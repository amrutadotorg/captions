1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,662
You have come here to learn

2
00:00:05,662 --> 00:00:09,815
something, to go deep into your experiences

3
00:00:09,815 --> 00:00:16,664
of the knowledge of your roots.

4
00:00:16,664 --> 00:00:21,873
Shri Krishna has said that this is

5
00:00:21,873 --> 00:00:25,616
a tree which is upside down, the

6
00:00:25,616 --> 00:00:29,604
roots are upwards and the

7
00:00:29,604 --> 00:00:32,563
leaves are outwards.

8
00:00:32,563 --> 00:00:35,313
In the same way, you

9
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:38,772
know that Kundalini, really, when

10
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:42,498
it rises in the Sahasrara or above

11
00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:45,763
Sahasrara, then you start getting the

12
00:00:45,763 --> 00:00:51,156
feeling of Kundalini. So, one has to

13
00:00:51,156 --> 00:00:55,150
understand that when we are now getting

14
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,204
subtler and subtler and trying to

15
00:00:58,204 --> 00:01:00,766
feel the Kundalini, we should try to

16
00:01:00,766 --> 00:01:05,971
get out of materialistic attitude and

17
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:09,036
materialistic viewpoint and materialistic

18
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:13,225
sticking point. I had met one

19
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:15,694
guru before, because you know I went

20
00:01:15,694 --> 00:01:18,498
to all of them. And I asked one of

21
00:01:18,498 --> 00:01:21,432
them, I said, why do you take money,

22
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:24,441
so much money from these people who

23
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:27,497
are western people? So much, why do you

24
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:30,659
take and just they become beggars,
absolutely, like beggars they become

25
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,694
because you charge them so much and

26
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:38,487
so heavily? And he told me that unless

27
00:01:38,487 --> 00:01:40,715
and until you make them beggars

28
00:01:40,715 --> 00:01:43,244
they will never take to God. They are

29
00:01:43,244 --> 00:01:46,335
too rich to be near God. I mean,

30
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:49,894
this explanation I just could not

31
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:53,154
understand. It was absurd, I could not

32
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:58,896
understand: How can this explanation
have any proper meaning that you should

33
00:01:58,896 --> 00:02:01,888
make people beggars and
then they be nearer to God?

34
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,205
I said, in India we have
many beggars; do you think

35
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:08,085
those beggars are nearer to God??So he

36
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:10,335
said, 揘o, otherwise, you see, they get

37
00:02:10,335 --> 00:02:12,718
stuck up with their money and you

38
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:16,055
must just make them absolutely without

39
00:02:16,055 --> 00:02:19,327
any money, moneyless people.

40
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:27,120
So, I mean, of course to such a
stupid person what can you talk?

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,750
What can you convince?

42
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,346
I couldn't say to him, then
why are you taking the money, if you are?

43
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:39,411
Then he would have said,
because I am detached.?

44
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:46,003
You see, anything one can say like that. If you
start like that, you cannot just stop it.

45
00:02:46,003 --> 00:02:51,945
But one has to understand that
materialism has gone into our roots.

46
00:02:51,945 --> 00:02:57,477
And if we have to clear out our roots
we must get out of materialism.

47
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:01,316
That's important, but that does not
in any way mean that you torture your

48
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:03,527
body or anything, I dont mean that.

49
00:03:03,527 --> 00:03:06,377
But what Iam saying, your attention.

50
00:03:06,377 --> 00:03:11,370
[Shri Mataji addresses some
children] you shouldn't do like that.

51
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:15,326
Always Natali you get up which you know is not
good.Always disturb is not good.Sit Down.

52
00:03:15,326 --> 00:03:17,778
Now even if there are so many
childrens sitting down here.

53
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:20,912
Please sit down and dont
disturb any more sit down.

54
00:03:20,912 --> 00:03:24,179
Sonu come and sit here. Sonu come here.Better....
and then she gets the diarrhea always.

55
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:44,993
You are not here just to enjoy but you are here for a
puja do you understand that. You are grown up girl now.

56
00:03:45,019 --> 00:04:23,109
Look at all these children's how they are sitting quitely.Will they move out? they don't understand English.I have seen all our English children whether it is in Caxton hall or whether it is any hall all of them must go out and
make a big noise and play there. It's always seen they cannot sit down. Look at them these children how quitely they are sitting. What a quality it is! They are just feeling the vibrations and they are enjoying it. They dont want

57
00:04:23,135 --> 00:05:39,616
to go out.There is no enjoyment outside. Its inside. See them. See the contrast.You must keep eyes open to see. See our children. Now Linda is there she will tell you. She has to manage the children outside the caxton hall.They are shouting,screaming and the caxton hall people will always tell me that its better not have childrens for your program because they make suchh a lot of noise. Its very common problem. They have atleast told me 10 times that please
don't allow children to come in. But the children will never sit quitely even for 5 minutes. As soon as 5 min. will start they will say lets go out.. They can't sit quitely. Poor Sonu whenever she goes out she gets a diarrhea. .....All right Orea you sit somewhere out from there separately. You also.You have only here 3 childrens and you will always see them walking about. and another is Mathews where is he? I have to keep eye on them. It's dangerous.

58
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:45,537
So now, when we are
dealing with our

59
00:05:46,248 --> 00:05:50,950
roots we have to be in the centre.

60
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,864
In the core. In the core mean we are

61
00:05:55,864 --> 00:06:00,866
taking in, sucking in the feeling

62
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:03,116
or you can say the?

63
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:10,671
Feeling and awareness put together, what do you
say to that in English, is there any word?

64
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:14,936
Is there any word which makes
awareness and feeling put together?

65
00:06:14,936 --> 00:06:20,197
Is there Gavin?

66
00:06:20,197 --> 00:06:23,519
[answer: Experience]

67
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,036
Oh, yeah, experience, you can say the

68
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:29,789
experience into your awareness and feeling.

69
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:34,517
You have to get the experience
into your awareness and feeling.

70
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:38,218
In Marathi it is a very simple word janiv

71
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:40,495
comes from the word ja.

72
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:45,955
Ja comes the word spontaneous.

73
00:06:45,955 --> 00:06:48,608
Also ja has two meanings:

74
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:57,274
Ja also means dnyana, awareness, and
also it means spontaneous. Janiv.

75
00:06:57,274 --> 00:07:07,638
So you start sucking that within yourself, when
you are not entangled into other things.

76
00:07:07,638 --> 00:07:12,538
If your attention is entangled
outside, you cannot enjoy.

77
00:07:12,538 --> 00:07:16,827
So, to be lost into which is
samaadhi you see, is the one where

78
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:21,402
your attention is completely
drowned into the experience.

79
00:07:21,402 --> 00:07:25,028
That iswhat we have to achieve.

80
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:29,817
So it is  not only materialism: also emotionalism, all kinds of "isms".

81
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:33,159
We are attacked by all kind of isms?

82
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:40,282
since the history of word started in this
world I think and now the unholy thing that

83
00:07:40,282 --> 00:07:46,034
the ism? latest is, could be sahaja
Yoga-ism?

84
00:07:46,034 --> 00:07:52,712
also could be the greatest word because now
there has to be an attack on Sahaja Yoga also.

85
00:07:52,712 --> 00:08:02,004
In this one is that as I told you, I didnt explain
it properly or you didnt hear Me properly that day,

86
00:08:02,004 --> 00:08:15,413
that Sahaja Yoga does not mean lethargy or
slowness, not at all, but is a quick and a fast

87
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:20,048
stepping in into the dissolution.

88
00:08:20,048 --> 00:08:23,110
Very quick.

89
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:27,005
And once you very quickly

90
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:29,955
dissolve into it, the whole movement

91
00:08:29,955 --> 00:08:31,797
of your body is quick but not jerky,

92
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:39,647
is smooth and quick. Rhythmic. Is musical,

93
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:42,813
neither is awkward nor lethargic,

94
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,889
but is musical. It has a rhythm about

95
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:49,852
it. Is very gracious.

96
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:54,442
The whole movement of dissolution can happen

97
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:59,687
to you very easily if you don't allow

98
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:07,014
your attention to be attacked by all these "isms."

99
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,543
There is no end to it.

100
00:09:08,543 --> 00:09:12,793
I mean, if I have to write all of them I
think we will have to need at least one book

101
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:18,878
to write all the ism's of the world, there
is no end to it, which we have created.

102
00:09:18,878 --> 00:09:23,185
Then the worst of all is now,
I think, Sahaja Yoga-ism

103
00:09:23,185 --> 00:09:30,432
in which first of all is
the feeling of lethargy:

104
00:09:30,432 --> 00:09:35,615
"It will happen Sahaja. Sit down,
Mother will do everything for you."

105
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:38,834
Another is Sahaja Yoga-egoism

106
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:42,604
in which we haven't got one fellow lying there.

107
00:09:42,604 --> 00:09:50,758
In which people, Sahaja Yogis, get into tantrums, try
to show off that they are great Sahaja Yogis.

108
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:56,686
they have reached the third stage
or the seventh stage or whatever they may be.

109
00:09:56,686 --> 00:10:02,434
Now it's good this example is a very
good example, I wish you had taken up.

110
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:08,875
But see the expression of the Indian,

111
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,359
the enamoured expressions. You see, it

112
00:10:11,359 --> 00:10:15,329
so genuine, they can't control within themselves, seeing Me.

113
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:22,688
Now, see, it's like, I just don't know, but people
think it's a package deal sort of a thing.

114
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:26,114
It's so nonsensical, I tell you. That either

115
00:10:26,114 --> 00:10:28,274
they could be taken out all their money

116
00:10:28,274 --> 00:10:33,631
or if they are to be told now for puja.
All of them are paying twenty-one

117
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:39,167
because they have to do this or this extra work, so
they are charging twenty-one.

118
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:42,981
And if you tell them [it’s] for puja they
will even give them fifty-one.

119
00:10:42,981 --> 00:10:51,183
But I have told some of you have even refused
that. I mean it's so shameful, I tell you!

120
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:55,855
It's absolutely shameful! Can you imagine?

121
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:58,016
What is twenty-one rupees to you?

122
00:10:58,016 --> 00:11:05,662
To them it's quite a lot, because it's some sort of
part of you you are giving which is so nonsensical.

123
00:11:05,662 --> 00:11:14,598
Just is a feeling. Is a sign of complete negativity. Left Nabhi.

124
00:11:14,598 --> 00:11:18,202
It's a problem. Materialism
it's complete materialism.

125
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:26,299
Those who have been, say, doing
vegetarianism are materialists in India,

126
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:35,071
we have seen the cases, like you see the Jains
and the Marvari and the Gujaratis.

127
00:11:35,071 --> 00:11:40,925
They are all vegetarians, supposed to be compassionate people.

128
00:11:40,925 --> 00:11:46,573
They build some temples also and sometimes
they give to poor people also and

129
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:50,562
sometimes to people like Hare-Rama-Hare-Krishna
who are begging in India.

130
00:11:50,562 --> 00:11:54,897
They give money to them. Supposed to be very compassionate

131
00:11:54,897 --> 00:11:59,252
They are more compassionate to
chickens than to human beings.

132
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:01,741
We have that kind.

133
00:12:01,741 --> 00:12:08,650
And the same kind I have seen in the
West also. Such materialistic people,

134
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:15,620
I mean, they have no shame.
So when you just turn and

135
00:12:15,646 --> 00:12:22,227
see that, should abhor that.
Abhor it. It's shameful!

136
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,555
How could you be like that even
in Sahaja Yoga?

137
00:12:25,597 --> 00:12:31,143
So as I have told you, there are
some people who are materialistic,

138
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:37,815
some people who are emotionalistic
and some people who are egoistic.

139
00:12:37,815 --> 00:12:43,121
Now leave all these things on the
sides, then you come in the centre.

140
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:46,163
Now you are in the centre.

141
00:12:46,163 --> 00:12:54,027
In the centre, people enjoy just the love
of their Mother, like Shri Ganesha does.

142
00:12:54,027 --> 00:13:01,872
Just think how your Mother loves you. Finished!
Can you? It’s a very sweet feeling

143
00:13:01,872 --> 00:13:05,188
And who is your Mother if you
really believe in Her, in Sahaja

144
00:13:05,188 --> 00:13:11,608
Yoga, these two things should solve the problem.
No more thinking.

145
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:14,139
Just think how much your Mother loves.

146
00:13:14,186 --> 00:13:22,655
That means you are jumping onto My Kundalini
and when you jump onto My Kundalini,

147
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:29,043
then there is no thought.
You cannot think.

148
00:13:29,043 --> 00:13:37,162
When you think that, how much your Mother loves
you, you are jumping onto My Kundalini. And

149
00:13:37,162 --> 00:13:40,456
that time, there is no thought.

150
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:43,795
It is very simple to
meditate in Sahaja Yoga

151
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:46,535
because you have somebody in person.

152
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,847
They never had somebody in person.

153
00:13:49,918 --> 00:13:52,308
So I can understand their problems-

154
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:54,525
there was nobody in person;

155
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:58,240
they had to do it in the air.

156
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,625
But here a sure-shot thing:
you can feel your vibrations

157
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:14,973
you can feel My love and you
can feel your own quality.

158
00:14:14,973 --> 00:14:21,456
It's very simple.

159
00:14:21,456 --> 00:14:29,610
But it's not the love that is selfish, it's not the love where you

160
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,074
say, Oh Mother loves me so She look after me,
She will do everything for me,

161
00:14:33,074 --> 00:14:37,994
She is going to do
everything.

162
00:14:37,994 --> 00:14:43,570
It's the love that other loves me so much,
what can I do for Her?

163
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:49,304
Which is the best flower I can give to my Mother?

164
00:14:49,304 --> 00:14:52,103
What does She need? She needs nothing.

165
00:14:52,103 --> 00:14:58,986
She doesn't need money, She doesn't need anything.
What can I give Her?

166
00:14:58,986 --> 00:15:01,582
Which is the best flower

167
00:15:01,582 --> 00:15:09,754
Like Shri Hanuman was given a gold necklace by Shri Sitaji.

168
00:15:09,754 --> 00:15:14,657
And He saw that, and He was sitting on a tree and

169
00:15:14,657 --> 00:15:24,411
He was breaking one by one all of those
big-big gold balls of His necklace.

170
00:15:24,411 --> 00:15:28,119
So Sitaji said, what are you doing?

171
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:33,623
He said, "I am trying to see in these balls where is Ram."

172
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:41,983
He said, none of them has, so I am just breaking
them to find out. Otherwise why should I wear it?

173
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:45,256
And then She said, "Really? Where is Ram?"

174
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:52,659
He opened His chest. He said,
see in My chest. He exists there.

175
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:57,893
So it is never a one-sided sort
of a thing. It is a thing that

176
00:15:57,893 --> 00:16:02,231
exists within you and you feel that
and then has to be reciprocal.

177
00:16:02,231 --> 00:16:14,959
In the water, if there is a ripple it goes
to the shores and then it returns back.

178
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:23,880
So with this force only, I tell you, you
can conquer your ego and superego.

179
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,969
There is no way out.

180
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:35,835
And for these Indians it is very easy to do because they

181
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:41,096
know their Mother's love.

182
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:46,060
I know there has been an attack on that point and

183
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,176
the mothers have been funny there.

184
00:16:48,176 --> 00:16:53,192
But doesn't matter; when you see
something, just put yourself to it.

185
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:58,148
To feel your roots.

186
00:16:58,148 --> 00:17:03,248
These are your roots. And then you see the enjoyment.

187
00:17:03,248 --> 00:17:06,795
The Mother Earth Herself
is sucking you now.

188
00:17:06,795 --> 00:17:13,612
She is sucking you down.

189
00:17:13,612 --> 00:17:16,061
That is how you meditate now.

190
00:17:16,104 --> 00:17:21,871
This is how you have to meditate, and it's
such a security giving thing.

191
00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:25,963
It will change your expressions, faces, everything.

192
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:38,170
And that enamoured expressions that you find in these
people will be on your face very soon

193
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:47,100
And complete silence will exist once you come on My Kundalini.

194
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:59,173
But not through your mental projections, but
through your meditative, spontaneous experience.

195
00:17:59,173 --> 00:18:02,863
It's very joygiving.

196
00:18:02,863 --> 00:18:05,712
Just feel the joy of that.

197
00:18:05,712 --> 00:18:13,976
You are all with Me here and the joy of that
feeling will really enlarge your hearts,

198
00:18:13,976 --> 00:18:19,704
and then, then you can give it to others.

199
00:18:19,704 --> 00:18:23,200
You don't have to be crazy about these things,

200
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:31,672
but just to feel it within yourself.

201
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:37,821
All right. Now I move on to Indians because

202
00:18:37,821 --> 00:18:41,927
they are a different style of people.

203
00:18:41,927 --> 00:18:46,582
May God bless you!

204
00:18:46,582 --> 00:18:48,793
(Marathi talk)

205
00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:40,759
Now, I was telling them, I must

206
00:31:40,759 --> 00:31:46,184
translate it to you in English is the
most important point

207
00:31:46,184 --> 00:31:51,759
I was telling that now you are transformed,
now you have become saints, no doubt of it.

208
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:54,678
Now from an egg you have become a bird,

209
00:31:54,678 --> 00:32:01,020
but, now what should happen to you?
Your Kundalini is still in the sacrum.

210
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:06,260
How it has happened that now you
have got all the Ganesha Shakti?

211
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:12,872
I have made you like Ganesha, in the same
pattern as I had made Ganesha you are made.

212
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:20,725
Now you have become a Ganesha,
and from this Ganesha stage,

213
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:30,109
which you think you are a Ganesha now,
if I offer you a throne of Shri Ganesha,

214
00:32:30,109 --> 00:32:35,649
if you have to sit on that throne
as a king, then what should happen?

215
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:40,922
Actually, that now your Kundalini should
not be anymore in the sacrum bone,

216
00:32:40,922 --> 00:32:46,013
but in your stomach, because Ganesha's
Kundalini is in the stomach.

217
00:32:46,013 --> 00:32:49,276
In the stomach means in the Nabhi Chakra.

218
00:32:49,276 --> 00:32:55,862
Means all your seeking has been
so far in materialism,

219
00:32:55,862 --> 00:33:01,566
has been in other things like in money, or in

220
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:05,964
power or in love or whatever it was.

221
00:33:05,964 --> 00:33:11,295
But now your Kundalini itself
is in the Nabhi Chakra, means

222
00:33:11,295 --> 00:33:16,187
your seeking is nothing but
itself has become the Kundalini.

223
00:33:16,187 --> 00:33:22,514
Your seeking has become the Kundalini,
means that you are the giver,

224
00:33:22,514 --> 00:33:26,425
now you are the Guru, you have
now become the Guru.

225
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:32,386
When the Kundalini starts from the Nabhi
that means now you are the Guru,

226
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:38,746
now you have to give all the
blessings,everything, as a Guru does.

227
00:33:38,746 --> 00:33:41,285
Now you all have become Gurus.

228
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:44,355
But that's only possible when the Kundalini has risen,

229
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:50,301
has lifted Her abode from the sacrum
to the stomach,

230
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:55,716
and this stage, unless and until it has
arrived, you are not a confirmed Guru.

231
00:33:55,716 --> 00:33:58,983
Once that has happened you
become a Guru and then

232
00:33:58,983 --> 00:34:05,047
you can really impress
people and work it out.

233
00:34:05,047 --> 00:34:07,267
It has to be done very fast.

234
00:34:07,267 --> 00:34:11,019
It has to work out very fast
and for that, first of all,

235
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:14,474
please get rid of your
entanglements which are stupid.

236
00:34:14,474 --> 00:34:18,330
If you really believe that you
have to progress in your seeking,

237
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:23,261
that you have to have your Kundalini
coming up from your Nabhi,

238
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:31,060
then please, please hurry up, please try to
work out, otherwise you are very few who

239
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:39,938
have been given also the privilege of
doing My Puja, very few.

240
00:34:39,938 --> 00:34:43,201
And those who have been given have a chance

241
00:34:43,201 --> 00:34:46,213
to develop to that stage, and
once you become that, all

242
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:51,777
of you who have achieved that
stage can become the Gurus.

243
00:34:51,777 --> 00:34:55,412
And for that, you have to have only wisdom.

244
00:34:55,412 --> 00:34:58,621
Wisdom, keep to your wisdom,

245
00:34:58,621 --> 00:35:04,289
and like Shri Ganesha has His
wisdom and in that wisdom He knew

246
00:35:04,289 --> 00:35:07,411
one thing: that His Mother was all powerful

247
00:35:07,411 --> 00:35:11,952
and that He doesn't have to worship
anybody else but His Mother.

248
00:35:11,952 --> 00:35:17,116
And He has to have all the
powers which are granted by Her.

249
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:22,994
His powers, no one, even Brahma,
Vishnu, Mahesha does not have.

250
00:35:22,994 --> 00:35:24,914
They cannot reach Ganesha;

251
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:28,699
They cannot reach His stage because
They are one-sided but

252
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:32,669
Shri Ganesha has all the powers,
all the Chaitanya powers He has.

253
00:35:32,669 --> 00:35:36,640
So to become like that, to be like
that,He should be your ideal:

254
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,338
how He behaved and how He would sacrifice
anything for the sake of Mother.

255
00:35:43,338 --> 00:35:49,904
Here there are people who don't even
want to pay for something like a puja and ..stuff

256
00:35:49,904 --> 00:35:54,298
which you may just spend away
somewhere in nonsensical things,

257
00:35:54,298 --> 00:35:58,379
because your attention has to
be brought round completely.

258
00:35:58,379 --> 00:36:04,601
It has to be completely severed from
all these nonsensical entanglements

259
00:36:04,601 --> 00:36:09,058
and there should be less talking and more experiencing.

260
00:36:09,058 --> 00:36:13,188
Then only it's going to work out.

261
00:36:13,188 --> 00:36:21,830
It's a good pleasure and a great
thing to be here in this holy land,

262
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:25,295
it's a very holy place
you can see it, so peaceful.

263
00:36:25,295 --> 00:36:28,221
Try to feel the peace within yourself that

264
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:31,839
is within every human being and after

265
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,803
that you have to know that this

266
00:36:33,803 --> 00:36:37,722
peace that you are achieving
has to be given to others.

267
00:36:37,722 --> 00:36:43,157
In Sahaja Yoga, perhaps you have realized,
whatever you have got from the nature,

268
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:45,774
you can release it back.

269
00:36:45,774 --> 00:36:50,964
For example if you give vibrations
to a plant you can make it grow.

270
00:36:50,964 --> 00:36:56,739
If you give vibrations to a flower
you can make it sustain its life.

271
00:36:56,739 --> 00:36:59,986
For the first time you are giving
something to the nature,

272
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:03,762
but as soon as you grow up to that state of a

273
00:37:03,762 --> 00:37:06,657
Guru then you can give the peace

274
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:13,917
that is in the nature, you can give the
feeling of bliss that is in the nature.

275
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:17,184
But first achieve it within yourself.

276
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:23,772
Make this go inside you and see
that bliss settle down within you.

277
00:37:23,772 --> 00:37:27,441
You don't see other nonsensical
things which are very disturbing

278
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:29,532
sometimes to your western mind.

279
00:37:29,532 --> 00:37:36,696
For example if a telephone is not working or the road is not all right, if the
bathroom is not this.

280
00:37:36,696 --> 00:37:43,066
These nonsensical things have no meaning, but
feel the peace outside,

281
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:52,194
try to establish that peace within because
this peace you have to give to others.

282
00:37:52,194 --> 00:37:56,322
The whole development plan
that I have is very fast

283
00:37:56,322 --> 00:37:59,101
and I am sure you will keep pace with me.

284
00:37:59,101 --> 00:38:00,172
So may God bless you!

285
00:38:00,172 --> 00:38:07,079
When you sit down just feel the peace and
try to achieve that peace within yourself.

286
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,001
Don't pay attention to nonsensical
things and this with this your little

287
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:16,790
brain trying to criticize, but try to
achieve the peace within yourself so

288
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:20,168
that you can give peace to others.

289
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:26,324
It's not proper that some of you are looking after
the negative people all the time, it's not proper.

290
00:38:26,324 --> 00:38:28,189
You don't have to look
after the negative people.

291
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:29,812
Just leave them alone.

292
00:38:29,812 --> 00:38:34,265
Keep out of that because negative
people can always bring you down.

293
00:38:34,265 --> 00:38:39,156
Don't try to improve the conditions of the
negative, leave them behind. You go fast.

294
00:38:39,156 --> 00:38:45,069
Once you have achieved that state
then we can arrange for them to come.

295
00:38:45,069 --> 00:38:49,113
For example, if My car has failed, all
right, I got into another car, which

296
00:38:49,113 --> 00:38:51,685
was all right because I have to come to the program.

297
00:38:51,685 --> 00:38:55,107
Then I can send the tempo
from here to get that another

298
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:59,912
car where there were some people who
were not supposed to be at the program.

299
00:38:59,912 --> 00:39:04,031
That's how you have to be quick and
not bother your heads too much

300
00:39:04,031 --> 00:39:08,368
about the negative people who are sick
people, trying to be compassionate.

301
00:39:08,368 --> 00:39:09,353
There is no need.

302
00:39:09,353 --> 00:39:10,866
Tell them, tell Mother.

303
00:39:10,866 --> 00:39:12,360
Let you talk to Mother.

304
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,898
Look after yourselves and
don't be bothered about them.

305
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:19,197
This is another nonsensical
idea of compassion you have got.

306
00:39:19,197 --> 00:39:22,252
Compassion is not mental projection I told you:

307
00:39:22,252 --> 00:39:25,024
the compassion that works, that flows.

308
00:39:25,024 --> 00:39:28,996
It's all mental you see for us
compassion is mental, every idea,

309
00:39:28,996 --> 00:39:34,591
peace is mental, bliss is mental, God
is mental, everything is mental for us.

310
00:39:34,591 --> 00:39:41,260
He is not. He is the one that
resides in the heart as Spirit.

311
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,858
He is the one who works
through the compassion.

312
00:39:43,858 --> 00:39:49,980
And now you know My compassion is
that it flows, it works, it acts.

313
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,898
It's not mental.

314
00:39:54,898 --> 00:40:00,475
So don't try to be mentally concerned
with people and try to be compassionate.

315
00:40:00,475 --> 00:40:01,448
All right?

316
00:40:01,448 --> 00:40:05,944
I hope you understand that the
compassion is not a mental idea

317
00:40:05,944 --> 00:40:10,416
that we are compassionate, we are working
for the unity of the world.And all that.

318
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:15,963
Even unity and all those ideas, even
the idea of collective understanding

319
00:40:15,963 --> 00:40:20,428
is in the heart, it should work.

320
00:40:20,428 --> 00:40:23,972
In Sanskrit it is Kaaryanvit.

321
00:40:23,972 --> 00:40:27,175
In English there is no word. Kaaryanvit

322
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:30,066
is embodied with the working capacity,

323
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:32,917
embodied with the working out capacity

324
00:40:32,917 --> 00:40:35,953
actually working out capacity
you can translate like that.

325
00:40:35,953 --> 00:40:36,993
It should work.

326
00:40:36,993 --> 00:40:41,345
If it does not work out then what's the use
of looking after somebody who is sick?

327
00:40:41,345 --> 00:40:46,194
all right, come along This is
nonsense, this is very mental.

328
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:54,438
Just don't waste your energy; you have
not come here to look after the sick.

329
00:40:54,438 --> 00:41:01,469
I hope you understand this idea of looking after the
sick and being very

330
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:04,734
is all ego-oriented, see we are trying to help the sick,

331
00:41:04,734 --> 00:41:08,603
we are trying to help this, that,?all ego-oriented.

332
00:41:08,603 --> 00:41:13,199
Another superego-oriented that we
are sacrificing this and that and

333
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:18,265
we are becoming beggars in India like the
Hare-Rama-Hare-Krishna. Beggars, parasites.

334
00:41:18,265 --> 00:41:21,804
Both are just the same, now
please don't do all these things

335
00:41:21,804 --> 00:41:31,321
and try to keep yourself glued to one ideal:

336
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:34,735
that you have to ascend faster.

337
00:41:34,735 --> 00:41:41,148
You have to individually ascend faster
and collectively pull out everyone

338
00:41:41,148 --> 00:41:45,876
but not those who are heavily
laden with problems and

339
00:41:45,876 --> 00:41:49,282
who are creating problems and
objecting your progress.

340
00:41:49,282 --> 00:41:53,115
That doesn't mean that you are
not compassionate.

341
00:41:53,115 --> 00:41:59,249
You know how much compassion that I have but
My compassion doesn't make stories,

342
00:41:59,249 --> 00:42:02,310
I am so compassionate and I am this and that.

343
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:07,581
Up to a point is all right but don't so too much
bother about people who are dragging you behind.

344
00:42:07,581 --> 00:42:10,091
You have come here for a training,

345
00:42:10,091 --> 00:42:18,440
a training into the understanding
of awareness which is compassion.

346
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,671
You all have to, even, when you go to the
school, you are not bothered about a person

347
00:42:22,671 --> 00:42:26,328
who is lacking in the
class, do you?

348
00:42:26,328 --> 00:42:29,086
You want to study fast so that you come up well.

349
00:42:29,086 --> 00:42:32,539
In the same way, I would
request you not to bother your

350
00:42:32,539 --> 00:42:36,552
heads too much about people who
are trying to pull you down

351
00:42:36,552 --> 00:42:39,478
because I don't want you to be pulled down.

352
00:42:39,478 --> 00:42:45,710
That's My compassion for them and for you.

353
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:48,630
Let Me look after them and you just
don't worry your heads about them.

354
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,693
They will be all right.

355
00:42:51,693 --> 00:42:52,849
So, may God bless you!

356
00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:59,919
Lets have a puja today, and
this puja will be simple today.

357
00:42:59,919 --> 00:43:05,580
I think we will have Ganesha's Puja and
then we will have Devi's Puja today,

358
00:43:05,659 --> 00:43:12,286
and then we will have a good havan.
That is a good place for havan.
