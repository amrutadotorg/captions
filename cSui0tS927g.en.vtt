00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:11.042
The difference between us and Christ is that

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:13.876
faith was part and parcel of His being.

00:00:14.334 --> 00:00:19.042
It was not that He had to have faith – He was faith.

00:00:19.751 --> 00:00:22.667
Now we have to have it.

00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:26.918
We have to believe in ourselves.

00:00:27.584 --> 00:00:29.626
There’s so many incidents I can give you

00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.876
which you can also tell Me, so many incidents

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:36.999
where just the faith has helped.

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:40.751
If you were in Romania I think it happened,

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:43.584
one lady came on the stage, she couldn’t walk,

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:46.250
they had to bring her on a wheelchair.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.125
And she said, “Mother, I know You can cure me.

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:52.709
Nobody can cure me; I know You can cure me.”

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:54.417
She said it three times.

00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:56.709
I said, “So, you believe that I’ll cure you.”

00:00:56.834 --> 00:00:59.334
“Yes.” I said, “Then get up.”

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:01.459
She just got up, walked out.

00:01:01.584 --> 00:01:04.375
And then she started running all the way,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.667
and everybody started laughing.

00:01:06.792 --> 00:01:08.751
They said, “Mother, she’s not a Sahaja yogini!”

00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:11.459
I said, “But see her faith!”

00:01:11.792 --> 00:01:17.667
Because when there is faith all the deities take it up:

00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:24.999
they’re challenged, they have to do it.

00:01:26.125 --> 00:01:28.709
They have shown faith in that person.

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:30.751
As I have told you always,

00:01:30.876 --> 00:01:34.167
in Sahaja Yoga we trust people, we trust.

00:01:34.292 --> 00:01:36.083
One among hundred might deceive us

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:37.999
doesn’t matter, we trust.

00:01:38.083 --> 00:01:42.125
That faith you put in that person works in his mind also,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.417
that “they have put so much faith in me.”

00:01:44.542 --> 00:01:47.709
But what about deities?

00:01:47.834 --> 00:01:50.999
You show faith in them and it works,

00:01:51.083 --> 00:01:52.751
immediately they work out.

00:01:52.876 --> 00:01:54.375
Like Guido told Me that

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.626
“Mother, they said there will be heavy rains

00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:59.709
for these two days.”

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:03.918
I said, “All right. Don’t worry.” ,Where is the rain?

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.083
It disappeared.

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.999
You can control anything if your faith is under control.

00:02:16.792 --> 00:02:20.999
And when we talk of faith, you know,

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:27.209
it’s the challenge to this all-pervading Power,

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.959
which organizes, which knows everything,

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.876
which is so intelligent, efficient

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.792
– above all, it loves you.

00:02:37.918 --> 00:02:40.999
And then you show faith.

00:02:42.542 --> 00:02:49.667
The resurrection in Sahaja Yoga is that your faith is solid.

00:02:50.918 --> 00:02:55.626
This you have to achieve: solid faith.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.834
They don’t feel then bad,

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.918
supposing I may not meet them, supposing I may say,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.792
“All right, come. You see, this time I may not be there.”

00:03:03.918 --> 00:03:07.250
Nothing matters, you see, whether Mother meets us or not,

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:10.250
whether this thing happens or not.

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:14.292
Everything is for our good, for our benevolence.

00:03:14.792 --> 00:03:16.417
Supposing you are lost on the way,

00:03:16.542 --> 00:03:19.834
know that it has to be that way.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.459
If you have to look at the life of Christ,

00:03:24.584 --> 00:03:26.417
He was to be crucified.

00:03:26.542 --> 00:03:28.250
He had to carry the cross,

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:32.250
He had to do all these things – it’s all right, whatever.

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:34.542
“It’s fated. I’ll do it.”

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:37.500
He never grumbled, He never grudged,

00:03:37.626 --> 00:03:41.584
He didn’t want anybody to share His problems.

00:03:42.083 --> 00:03:45.250
But this faith in Him gave Him

00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:50.626
such a tremendous powers.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
He could have done anything.

00:03:54.125 --> 00:03:56.417
He could have killed all these people

00:03:56.542 --> 00:04:00.417
who were trying to persecute Him, easily – what’s the harm?

00:04:00.542 --> 00:04:02.792
Just one glance could have killed them.

00:04:02.918 --> 00:04:06.125
But no, He knew He had to go through all that,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.709
He went through it.

00:04:07.834 --> 00:04:11.584
Ultimately, He is the one who’s victorious,

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.542
He is the one who won everything.

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.042
In the same way, a Sahaja yogi

00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:19.584
has to look at one’s own life.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:26.042
It’s very precious, life, it’s very precious in this world.

00:04:27.083 --> 00:04:31.209
These days, the how many there are Sahaja yogis?

00:04:34.125 --> 00:04:40.250
So when you have complete faith in yourself,

00:04:40.792 --> 00:04:43.334
then you don’t bother.

00:04:43.792 --> 00:04:46.459
Many people will find out whether

00:04:46.584 --> 00:04:49.250
“I go there – there’ll be a bathroom or not,

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:53.918
or there will be a place to sleep or not?” Nothing.

00:04:56.417 --> 00:04:59.125
You are looking for the comfort of your spirit.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.876
If you get, well and good, otherwise you can sleep anywhere.

00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:06.250
Nothing can bind you,

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:08.667
nothing can pull you down,

00:05:08.792 --> 00:05:12.626
no habit can come back on you;

00:05:14.751 --> 00:05:20.000
because faith will purify you completely,

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:23.959
it will enlighten you, it will nourish you.

00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:28.167
This faith is not something

00:05:28.292 --> 00:05:30.209
that can be put into your heads

00:05:30.334 --> 00:05:33.918
or can be put into your hearts, cannot be.

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:39.459
It’s a state which you have to achieve,

00:05:40.167 --> 00:05:45.167
and which you can achieve through Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:50.375
That’s how our resurrection would be complete,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.751
would be established,

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:55.999
would be effective,

00:05:56.083 --> 00:06:01.459
and for the whole world will be a model.

00:06:02.083 --> 00:06:04.083
May God bless you all.
