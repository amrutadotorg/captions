00:07.751 --> 00:11.042
The difference between us and Christ is that

00:11.167 --> 00:13.876
faith was part and parcel of His being.

00:14.334 --> 00:19.042
It was not that He had to have faith – He was faith.

00:19.751 --> 00:22.667
Now we have to have it.

00:23.209 --> 00:26.918
We have to believe in ourselves.

00:27.584 --> 00:29.626
There’s so many incidents I can give you

00:30.125 --> 00:32.876
which you can also tell Me, so many incidents

00:32.999 --> 00:36.999
where just the faith has helped.

00:38.209 --> 00:40.751
If you were in Romania I think it happened,

00:41.125 --> 00:43.584
one lady came on the stage, she couldn’t walk,

00:43.709 --> 00:46.250
they had to bring her on a wheelchair.

00:46.500 --> 00:50.125
And she said, “Mother, I know You can cure me.

00:50.334 --> 00:52.709
Nobody can cure me; I know You can cure me.”

00:52.834 --> 00:54.417
She said it three times.

00:54.542 --> 00:56.709
I said, “So, you believe that I’ll cure you.”

00:56.834 --> 00:59.334
“Yes.” I said, “Then get up.”

00:59.459 --> 01:01.459
She just got up, walked out.

01:01.584 --> 01:04.375
And then she started running all the way,

01:04.500 --> 01:06.667
and everybody started laughing.

01:06.792 --> 01:08.751
They said, “Mother, she’s not a Sahaja yogini!”

01:08.876 --> 01:11.459
I said, “But see her faith!”

01:11.792 --> 01:17.667
Because when there is faith all the deities take it up:

01:18.626 --> 01:24.999
they’re challenged, they have to do it.

01:26.125 --> 01:28.709
They have shown faith in that person.

01:29.209 --> 01:30.751
As I have told you always,

01:30.876 --> 01:34.167
in Sahaja Yoga we trust people, we trust.

01:34.292 --> 01:36.083
One among hundred might deceive us

01:36.209 --> 01:37.999
doesn’t matter, we trust.

01:38.083 --> 01:42.125
That faith you put in that person works in his mind also,

01:42.250 --> 01:44.417
that “they have put so much faith in me.”

01:44.542 --> 01:47.709
But what about deities?

01:47.834 --> 01:50.999
You show faith in them and it works,

01:51.083 --> 01:52.751
immediately they work out.

01:52.876 --> 01:54.375
Like Guido told Me that

01:54.500 --> 01:57.626
“Mother, they said there will be heavy rains

01:57.751 --> 01:59.709
for these two days.”

01:59.834 --> 02:03.918
I said, “All right. Don’t worry.” ,Where is the rain?

02:05.250 --> 02:08.083
It disappeared.

02:08.459 --> 02:13.999
You can control anything if your faith is under control.

02:16.792 --> 02:20.999
And when we talk of faith, you know,

02:21.792 --> 02:27.209
it’s the challenge to this all-pervading Power,

02:28.209 --> 02:32.959
which organizes, which knows everything,

02:33.250 --> 02:35.876
which is so intelligent, efficient

02:35.999 --> 02:37.792
– above all, it loves you.

02:37.918 --> 02:40.999
And then you show faith.

02:42.542 --> 02:49.667
The resurrection in Sahaja Yoga is that your faith is solid.

02:50.918 --> 02:55.626
This you have to achieve: solid faith.

02:56.209 --> 02:57.834
They don’t feel then bad,

02:57.959 --> 03:00.918
supposing I may not meet them, supposing I may say,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.792
“All right, come. You see, this time I may not be there.”

03:03.918 --> 03:07.250
Nothing matters, you see, whether Mother meets us or not,

03:07.375 --> 03:10.250
whether this thing happens or not.

03:10.375 --> 03:14.292
Everything is for our good, for our benevolence.

03:14.792 --> 03:16.417
Supposing you are lost on the way,

03:16.542 --> 03:19.834
know that it has to be that way.

03:20.500 --> 03:24.459
If you have to look at the life of Christ,

03:24.584 --> 03:26.417
He was to be crucified.

03:26.542 --> 03:28.250
He had to carry the cross,

03:28.375 --> 03:32.250
He had to do all these things – it’s all right, whatever.

03:32.375 --> 03:34.542
“It’s fated. I’ll do it.”

03:34.667 --> 03:37.500
He never grumbled, He never grudged,

03:37.626 --> 03:41.584
He didn’t want anybody to share His problems.

03:42.083 --> 03:45.250
But this faith in Him gave Him

03:45.375 --> 03:50.626
such a tremendous powers.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
He could have done anything.

03:54.125 --> 03:56.417
He could have killed all these people

03:56.542 --> 04:00.417
who were trying to persecute Him, easily – what’s the harm?

04:00.542 --> 04:02.792
Just one glance could have killed them.

04:02.918 --> 04:06.125
But no, He knew He had to go through all that,

04:06.250 --> 04:07.709
He went through it.

04:07.834 --> 04:11.584
Ultimately, He is the one who’s victorious,

04:11.709 --> 04:14.542
He is the one who won everything.

04:15.209 --> 04:17.042
In the same way, a Sahaja yogi

04:17.167 --> 04:19.584
has to look at one’s own life.

04:19.709 --> 04:26.042
It’s very precious, life, it’s very precious in this world.

04:27.083 --> 04:31.209
These days, the how many there are Sahaja yogis?

04:34.125 --> 04:40.250
So when you have complete faith in yourself,

04:40.792 --> 04:43.334
then you don’t bother.

04:43.792 --> 04:46.459
Many people will find out whether

04:46.584 --> 04:49.250
“I go there – there’ll be a bathroom or not,

04:49.375 --> 04:53.918
or there will be a place to sleep or not?” Nothing.

04:56.417 --> 04:59.125
You are looking for the comfort of your spirit.

04:59.250 --> 05:02.876
If you get, well and good, otherwise you can sleep anywhere.

05:03.375 --> 05:06.250
Nothing can bind you,

05:06.709 --> 05:08.667
nothing can pull you down,

05:08.792 --> 05:12.626
no habit can come back on you;

05:14.751 --> 05:20.000
because faith will purify you completely,

05:20.375 --> 05:23.959
it will enlighten you, it will nourish you.

05:24.042 --> 05:28.167
This faith is not something

05:28.292 --> 05:30.209
that can be put into your heads

05:30.334 --> 05:33.918
or can be put into your hearts, cannot be.

05:34.626 --> 05:39.459
It’s a state which you have to achieve,

05:40.167 --> 05:45.167
and which you can achieve through Sahaja Yoga.

05:45.792 --> 05:50.375
That’s how our resurrection would be complete,

05:51.500 --> 05:53.751
would be established,

05:53.999 --> 05:55.999
would be effective,

05:56.083 --> 06:01.459
and for the whole world will be a model.

06:02.083 --> 06:04.083
May God bless you all.
