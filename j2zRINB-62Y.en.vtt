00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
Based on and inspired by the teachings
of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, this series

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.574
aims to explore the evolutionary relationship
between two interconnected domains

00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:07.844
expressing human awareness
at the gross and subtle levels.

00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:11.115
It endeavors to elucidate this complex interplay
between the current scientific understanding

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:13.919
of human neuroanatomy; the autonomic
nervous system in particular,

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.923
and the so-called subtle system as described
in the traditional literature on yoga.

00:00:16.923 --> 00:00:19.961
Ultimately, the series tries to bring its viewers
along this exploratory journey

00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:23.500
to experience these relationships through meditation
as taught by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.520
Hello and welcome to yet another milestone

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.240
in our learning journey with
our guest, Dr. Ashish Pradhan.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.440
We have had some very interesting
conversations thus far

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.320
and I am really looking forward to another
intriguing discussion today with him.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.480
Welcome, Dr. Ashish.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.880
Thank you.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.680
Thanks for having me back, Monikaji.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.360
We'll start with the question,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.280
which is the relationship between
the autonomic nervous system

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.320
and the energy center
that we are discussing today,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.760
which is the fourth one

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.000
and which organs does this
energy center relate to?

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.160
So as we have said
in the previous episodes,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.040
as we look at the Sahaj principles

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.960
and the relationship between energy centers
and the organs that it controls,

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.680
the fourth energy center, also
called the Anahata chakra,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.880
controls multiple
absolutely vital organs.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.760
The first one of course is the heart.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.760
The second one is the entire respiratory system,
which is the tracheobronchial tree,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.160
which is the trachea, the bronchi,
and the lungs, both of them.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.920
And another gland, which is
called a thymus gland,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.680
which sits here in front of the sternum

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.320
and it is related to our immunology
and we'll come to that later.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.360
That is what this
energy center controls.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.320
To get into a little more detail,
this energy center controls the heart

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.680
probably through the cardiac plexus.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.520
The cardiac plexus is a group of nerves

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.800
that have both parasympathetic
and sympathetic components

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.640
of the autonomic nervous system.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.640
We have said the autonomic nervous system
has two components,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.320
parasympathetic, 
which is rest and digest,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.480
sympathetic that is more
related to flight and fight.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.880
And today we are going to discuss
this extremely critical component

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.440
or this critical aspect
of human physiology.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.640
So the cardiac plexus
controls the heart rate,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.800
as well as the force of contraction
of the heart.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.520
And both those things
are very important.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.440
With that, it also helps to
regulate our blood pressure.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.280
So that's as far as
the heart is concerned,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.040
and we'll come to that a little
later in today's session.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.400
The other component in how
this chakra controls

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.600
the other most important organs
within this anatomical space

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.360
are of course our lungs
and the tracheobronchial tree.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.000
And that is controlled
through the vagus nerve,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.680
not the cardiac plexus.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.720
The vagus nerve 
we have discussed previously

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.400
is a nerve that originates in
the brain, in the midbrain.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.720
And it is a predominant aspect

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.160
of the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.560
So it is through the vagus nerve
that both the lungs,

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.720
as well as the trachea
and the bronchi,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.520
which is like a tree
that allows the air to come in,

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.560
oxygen to be exchanged, so on and so forth.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.560
So that is the importance
of this energy center.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.960
Once again to paraphrase,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.600
through the cardiac plexus, this
energy center controls the heart,

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.200
its heart rate, and its contractility.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.280
And then through the vagus nerve,

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.000
controls the function of the lungs

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.320
and the entire respiratory system.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.160
It also controls the
functioning of the thymus gland,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.680
which is an endocrine gland,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.120
which is an immunologically very important gland,
but we'll come to that a little later.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.280
So when we talk about this energy center,
is there a relationship between this energy center

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.240
and the nervous system at
a human evolutionary level

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.360
or maybe at the embryological level?

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:21.680
Absolutely, this energy center is tremendously fascinating.
At an embryological level,

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.360
what happens is when the
embryo is formed,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.160
it is just a group of cells

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.480
and then, as everybody knows,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.920
it starts off at the zygote and
then it starts dividing.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.880
And what is formed initially
is a single line of cells

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.640
and within that single sort of line,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.880
it's like a column of cells, it has a cephalic end,
which you might say like a head end

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.160
and a caudal end, which is the back end.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:02.080
And there are cells that are formed
at the level of the cephalic end,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.720
which means at the head end of
this little column of cells,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:13.440
which are later on differentiated into
what are called cardiogenic cells.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.480
Cardiogenesis means the genesis
of the buds of the heart.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.760
And these cells are formed

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.200
at the head end of this little
group of cells in a column,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.080
and then they migrate downwards

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.840
as the embryo starts
differentiating into multiple organs.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.560
And that is how the heart is formed

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.520
and thereafter the blood
vessels, so on and so forth.

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:47.680
It is very interesting to know
that the origin of the heart as an organ

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:55.360
actually begins at the apex of the human organism,
even as it is being formed.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:06.560
And this has very, very profound implications
by way of inference of human spirituality.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.040
And we'll talk more about
this also in this episode,

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.920
but also when we talk about
it in the last episode,

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.560
when we talk about
the seventh energy center.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.680
So the origin of the heart
literally begins at the crown -

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.120
or what is the crown end
of this little organism.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.000
And by day 21, the heart
is already pumping blood

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.840
to allow for the oxygenation
and the health of this organism.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.720
So from an evolutionary point of view,

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.960
this energy center literally controls
the existence of the organism,

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.440
because without that, there would be no organism,
the viability of this organism,

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.440
that is us, each and every one of us

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.000
when we were conceived in our
mother's womb would not be possible.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.120
So that is at the embryological level.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:10.400
At an evolutionary level,
it is obvious,

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.240
as we have seen
from unicellular bacteria,

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.200
that when life began in the very first episode,
when we talked about the first energy center,

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.400
its differentiation, its gradual evolution
into multicellular organisms,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:28.480
it is entirely possible that it
is due to this energy center,

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.800
that the better differentiation started happening.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:38.640
So if you look at these small
organisms, let's say fish,

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.600
in the aquatic life forms,

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:51.200
and we look at the circulatory system,
it goes on evolving from a single chambered organ,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.280
so called the heart,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.120
from a single chambered organ,
it goes to a two chambered organ,

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:01.280
it then becomes a three chambered
organ in birds, for example,

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:06.320
and then in mammals, such as us, it
becomes a fully four chambered heart.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:12.640
So this energy center
plays that critical role,

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:18.000
or that has probably played this
role in the evolution from fish,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.080
and from those kinds of organisms
from amphibians to terrestrials,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:26.480
to birds to vertebrates, 
including us as human beings.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.280
And this has been important because

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.280
as the human body became more
and more complex,

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.400
as vertebrates and mammals
became more and more complex,

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:44.080
the metabolic demand for oxygenated
blood was more required.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.280
That is why the differentiation of the heart

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.600
between a single chambered right
up to a four chambered heart

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.360
with complete partition between
the atria, which is on top,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.520
and the ventricles, which are below.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.760
The left side of the heart
deals with oxygenated blood;

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:09.360
the right side pumps out
deoxygenated blood into the lungs.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:16.000
All of that organization, if you will,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.200
or the entire evolutionary process was
governed probably by this fourth energy center.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.720
Again, to paraphrase,
our very existence

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:29.520
and our continued existence
depends on this energy center

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:33.200
because it controls
the heart and the lungs.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.320
Very nicely explained.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.840
I think this is really,
really very helpful information.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.280
So this brings me to just another question

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.840
that there is this expression that
the heart is the spark of life.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:50.400
Now, is there any truth or a
spiritual correlation here?

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.560
Absolutely. So it is kind of metaphorical,

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.880
but if we examine
how does the heart function?

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.760
Within the upper right chamber
of the heart, the right atrium,

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.640
there is a small group of cells.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.840
It is called the sinoatrial node.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.880
And this is a highly
specialized group of cells.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:18.240
We discussed in the very
first episode, I believe,

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.520
What causes the generation
of an electrical impulse

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.960
within any cellular system?

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:32.160
It is the inflow and outflow
of potassium and sodium ions.

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.040
They pass through what
are called as ion channels,

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.480
and they create a difference in
the polarity of the cell membrane.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:47.034
And that causes a change in the polarity
that creates an electrical current.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:55.200
In this sinoatrial node, for reasons
that we have still not been able to fully fathom,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:12:00.160
the movement of these sodium and
potassium ions happens very, very fast.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.920
And it happens in a way that
literally creates the spark of life,

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.040
because it is from here that
the impulse is generated

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:13.200
in the upper right hand side of the heart.

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:18.240
And from there, it is transmitted downwards
from the atria to the ventricles.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.960
And when that impulse is transmitted,
it causes the heart to contract.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.120
And then it contracts and then it relaxes.
It contracts and it relaxes.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:32.960
And it does that 72 times
on an average per minute,

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.920
that is literally thousands of times per day,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:40.000
and in a lifetime
of an average individual,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.120
a couple of billion times.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:49.360
So this energy, literally this
energy is the spark of life.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:55.120
The spark of life is literally
generated within the heart.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:00.400
And this spark,
if it goes out of sync,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.600
or if it stops, then
life is in many ways extinguished.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.800
So there is a lot of
physiological truth to the fact

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:15.360
that within the heart
is the spark of life.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.800
From the spiritual point of
view, we say that it is the place

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.520
where the Soul or the Atma resides.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:26.640
So there is an absolute
synchrony or congruence

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.920
to the notion that the Atma
or the Soul or the Spirit

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.080
is the true spark of life from
a spiritual point of view.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:41.040
And that is what Sahaj is really about,
realizing our true selves, self-realization.

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.920
But from a physiological point of view,
there is 100% correlation that the spark of life

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:49.040
literally resides within the heart.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:55.120
So, Dr. Ashish, when we talk about heart,
even as a layman, or whether it's in medicine,

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.400
we know of it as a single organ, right?

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.840
But I understand that within Sahaj principles,
there is something called the center heart

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.640
that relates to the sense
of protection and security.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:11.440
So is there any support for this principle
at the level of human physiology?

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:12.800
Yes, there is.

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.560
So what happens is, from a Sahaj point of view,
we have not one but three hearts,

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.120
we have one on the left side,
one in the center,

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.760
one also on the right side
of the human subtle system.

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.760
But essentially, it is

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.880
the fourth energy center, which we
can say has three aspects to it.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.760
So the center heart is related to

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.440
or probably governs the
function of the thymus gland.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.800
The thymus gland is a very
important immunologic organ,

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:49.200
because what it does is it
produces the white blood cells

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.400
of the T variety, which are
called thymus derived cells.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:15:04.080
And these cells play an absolutely critical role
in protecting the body from infections.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.640
Whenever there is an infection -

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:10.880
viral, bacterial or parasitic -

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.040
these are the cells that literally
are the soldiers of the body

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.840
that go out and they attack these
foreign organisms, these invaders,

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.560
and they destroy them,
they help to destroy them.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:29.600
There are also other kinds of white blood cells
called B cells. But these - the T cells - 

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.200
are lymphocytes, the fighter cells

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.360
that help protect the organism.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.160
So the notion of protection comes
from that point of view as well.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:48.400
It's of interest to know that people
who feel insecure or are depressed

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:54.640
tend to have a greater proportion
of susceptibility to infections,

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.960
to autoimmune disorders,

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:02.880
there is a lot of literature around it
that people who tend to be depressed,

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.680
what we call in Sahaja left-sided,

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.800
they tend to have a lot of
susceptibility to infections

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.920
and sometimes even certain malignancies.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.240
So, such a correlation is possible.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:20.020
But is there a one-to-one correspondence

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.920
between cause and effect?

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:26.080
The cause and effect relationship over
a period of time will become clearer,

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:30.160
but it is absolutely clear
that at a physical level,

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:32.400
from an immunologic point of view,

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:38.240
the 4th energy center plays a very critical role
in the immune homeostasis

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.360
or maintaining the immune profile
or immune competence of the organism

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.080
and allows for our survival.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.720
And at the same time, from
an emotional point of view,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.840
it tends to give that sense of protection

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:57.040
that allows us to overcome
any kind of adversity.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.480
Adversity is a fact of life,
not every day is all roses.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.920
There are difficulties that
everybody has to face in their life.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.160
It is the way in which you face them.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:14.000
And it is this energy center that
provides that support

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.240
to individuals to overcome that.

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:21.440
Yes, there is very much a sense
of providing security

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.600
through the function of this energy center.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.080
So this is really very interesting.

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:29.040
When we talk about
the heart as an organ,

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.680
is there something about
the heart which directly relates

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.360
to the concept of collectivity in any way?

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.920
Yes, it's a question I
was really looking forward to,

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:43.200
to explain.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:50.240
So the heart represents a very
interesting physiologic paradigm.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.000
And the paradigm is this,
that just a few moments ago,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.640
we described how the electrical
impulse that is generated

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.480
in the upper right part of the heart
travels across the entire musculature.

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.760
Now, the heart is a muscular organ,

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:13.680
it has no bones in it,
it's just a mass of muscle.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:22.880
And when the impulse is conducted,
the entire thing happens in less than a second.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.120
If you're beating 72 times per minute,

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.040
obviously one cardiac cycle
from contraction to relaxation

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:33.600
has to happen in less than one second.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.840
So it is extremely fast,
it's extremely efficient.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.840
But the beauty of this is
that when the impulse passes

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:46.800
the entire mass of cells,

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.920
there are millions and millions of
cells that constitute the heart.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:58.560
The nerve fibers that
are made up of these cells,

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.680
they all contract in unison.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:06.000
It all happens at once; it's
not like one muscle cell says,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.880
"I will think about it later. 
Okay. You know..."

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.560
It doesn't function that way.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.480
If it functions that way, that
is when we get arrhythmias.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:19.200
Arrhythmias are a break in
the rhythm of the heart.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:25.520
So when the heart beats, it beats in
this very beautiful cyclical rhythm.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.320
And that is literally what keeps us alive.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:33.840
The moment the heart starts going out of rhythm,
that's when we start getting into trouble.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.940
Heart attacks can cause arrhythmias

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:39.280
or other things can cause arrhythmias.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:44.720
So the concept of collectivity as the
heart represents is this,

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.880
that when there is an impulse,
all the cells of the heart,

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:52.400
the musculature of the heart,
the entire tissue,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.920
every cell, every fiber in the heart
comes together and contracts together.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.920
And that is how they work together.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:05.360
There is no notion of a democracy there,

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.160
where a group of cells says, "No, no, no,

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.760
we are not interested in contracting.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.640
We'll think about this
later. Or we are dissenting."

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.720
No, the heart doesn't function that way.

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.320
It's not a political system.
It's not a democratic system.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.720
It's a system where
everything works together.

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.520
And it works beautifully harmoniously.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.400
And that is the Sahaj
concept of collectivity.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:33.360
We will examine that more when we
talk about the fifth energy center.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:36.560
But even at the level of the heart,
this is where

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.920
at least for somebody like myself
who has a medical background,

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:44.320
and is a Sahaj practitioner,
I find that absolutely fascinating

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:50.400
that when we say we are all part
of the heart of a divine power,

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:58.000
we are all part of this one existence,
we are all cells of a larger being.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.240
What does that mean?
It actually means
even at a physiological level,

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:07.280
it is represented within us
that all the cells of our heart,

00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:11.760
all the tissues,
all the muscle fibers,

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:17.280
work together for our benefit
for the benevolence of this organism.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.600
And that's how the heart to me
at least represents an organ

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.840
that symbolizes at a physiological,
at an anatomical level,

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.920
the spiritual concept of collectivity.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:33.840
It is so fascinating
to learn more and more about

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:35.040
all of this from you.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.680
It tells us how nature has created

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:43.040
such complex mechanisms within everything
that exists as life on this planet.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:45.840
This was really very helpful.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.520
And I would like to thank you,
Dr. Ashish, for your time today.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:52.160
And we look forward to meeting you soon

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:55.680
with our next discussion topic, which
will be the fifth energy center.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.440
Thanks once again.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.520
Thank you, Monikaji.
It was a real pleasure.

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.040
See you soon.

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.560
We would like to invite
and recommend our audiences

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.280
to follow the video by
the founder, Shri Mataji

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.000
and get an experience of this meditation.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.640
We will talk to you soon
in our next episode.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:25.360
Shri Mataji: The center one I have
told you is the heart plexus,

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:30.160
which we call as cardiac plexus,
and it has got ten sub-plexuses.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:34.400
And the English names for that I will, again,
I am going to give you the complete list.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.280
I don't know when we'll have time
to go to the medical journal,

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.520
but I'll find out all of them
and I'm going to tell you

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.960
what they call it
in medical terminology.

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.000
But they know that
there are ten sub-plexuses

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.920
which are supplying to the
muscles of the heart, to the lungs

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.656
and to the right side lungs,
and that's how they divide it.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:07.040
Keep your eyes closed.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:11.920
First of all, please put your right hand
on your heart.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.920
All the time the left hand is towards Me.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:26.240
Now, here you have to say in your heart,
with all sincerity, Mother, am I the Spirit?

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.880
Ask the question three times
in your heart.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.990
This is a very fundamental question.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:58.240
Now bring the right hand
on to the left hand side of your stomach,

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:02.160
in the upper part.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.520
Here press it.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:12.000
Now this is the center of your mastery,
your guidance, your guru Tattva, as they say.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.400
So ask a question,
Mother, am I my own master?

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.720
This is the question to be asked
three times.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:24.551
Mother, am I my own master?

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:44.480
Now bring your right hand down below
in the lower part of the abdomen.

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:52.160
Now this is the center from which
all the Divine work is done,

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.960
all the pure work is done.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:00.080
So to ask six times,
because this center has got six petals,

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:05.760
Mother, please give me pure knowledge.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.960
Six times you just ask.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:14.191
As a result of this asking
the Kundalini starts getting awakened.

00:25:25.071 --> 00:25:29.840
Now to help the Kundalini to rise
you have to cooperate with Her.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:34.000
So please put your right hand
on the left hand side

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:43.200
in the upper part of your abdomen
and press it on the stomach.

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:48.880
Now here you have to say
with full confidence,

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:55.600
to help the Kundalini to rise,
Mother, I am my own master.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.840
This you have to say ten times.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.880
These are the ten commandments
which you have to say,

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:05.615
that Mother, I am my own master.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.400
Now, ten times with full confidence.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:58.480
Now please raise your right hand
to your heart.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:05.360
Now here you have to say,
again with full confidence,

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.760
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:10.160
This is the truth, you are the Spirit.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:15.600
But you have to say with full confidence,
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.356
This you have to say twelve times.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:54.960
Now one has to know
that God Almighty is the ocean of love.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.840
But above all He is the ocean
of forgiveness.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.680
So He forgives.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.320
Whatever wrong you do He forgives.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:12.000
So don't feel guilty
and put your right hand across

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:20.480
on the left hand side in the corner
which is made by your neck and your shoulder.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.640
Now here you have to say
again with full confidence,

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.400
sixteen times, Mother, I am not guilty.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:31.680
Please say it, Mother, I am not guilty.

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.120
Sixteen times.

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.483
I am not guilty at all.

00:28:38.483 --> 00:28:46.619
Please say it.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:26.160
Now raise your hand across on your forehead
and it's a very important center.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:36.960
Here you have to say from your heart,
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.200
Please say it from your heart.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.280
How many times is not the point.

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.680
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:49.360
Now some would say
that it's very difficult to forgive.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:55.280
But it's a myth
that we do not forgive or we forgive.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.160
We do not do anything
in both the cases.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:02.160
But if we don't forgive
then we play into wrong hands.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:09.148
So please say from your heart,
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:23.760
Now please take your hand on the back agnya,
the same center, on the back side of your head

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:28.800
and allow your head to rest on it
and push it back a little bit.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:36.160
Now here you have to say
for your satisfaction,

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:42.640
because you always feel guilty,
that, O Divine, if I have done anything wrong,

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.950
please forgive me.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:31:00.160
Please forgive me, from your heart.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:06.720
Stretch your hand fully
and put your center of your palm

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:15.520
on top of the fontanel bone area,
which was a very soft bone in your childhood.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.720
Press it hard.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:20.240
Press hard your scalp.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:26.480
Now you have to move it seven times
saying one thing, which you have to ask for,

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:31.760
Mother, please give us My Self-realization,
because I cannot force on you.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.480
So you have to ask for it.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:43.040
Seven times press it hard
and move it seven times very hard.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:47.334
Slowly saying that.
