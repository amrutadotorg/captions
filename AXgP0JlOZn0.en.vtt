WEBVTT

02:45.955 --> 02:48.160
BM: Gravity is also one type of energy, isn't it, Shri Mataji?

02:48.361 --> 02:50.959
SM: Of course, in the Feet.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.999
SY: In the Feet.

02:53.200 --> 02:55.859
BM: Because it is one of the things which balances us,

02:56.060 --> 02:58.500
called migraine (n.t. probably Baba Mama meant magnetism).

02:58.771 --> 03:02.471
Migraine (n.t. magnetism), migraine is one thing which balances us.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.639
Is there any relation between head and the feet?

03:05.840 --> 03:07.999
SM: The whole feet are in the head. (n.t. connected to the head probably).

03:08.200 --> 03:09.940
BM: The feet are in the head?

03:10.320 --> 03:12.520
SM: Or head is in the feet. BM: I also thought the same.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.660
Head in the feet or feet in the head, because...

03:16.180 --> 03:18.986
SM: When you rub My soles, vibrations come of your head.

03:19.187 --> 03:20.619
BM: Yes.

03:20.820 --> 03:23.354
SM: [unclear]

03:31.800 --> 03:36.604
BM: Yes, because when we rub Your Feet, we get a very good sleep.

03:36.805 --> 03:39.180
SM: Now, if we start from here...

03:39.460 --> 03:41.460
BM: Yes, Shri Mataji.

03:41.680 --> 03:46.179
SM: If you start... Now see, if you fold the sari

03:46.380 --> 03:48.888
like this, you see,

03:49.375 --> 03:52.100
the break is a forth, you see.

03:52.296 --> 03:55.679
So when it opens out, you see, these chakras.

03:55.880 --> 03:59.310
open up like this, see.

03:59.774 --> 04:03.485
So, this one at the back

04:03.686 --> 04:06.700
are the chakras and these are the incarnations,

04:06.918 --> 04:08.887
So in the center comes the heart.

04:09.088 --> 04:10.088
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

04:10.303 --> 04:13.834
Here is Mooladhara and here's Agnya.

04:15.180 --> 04:17.087
Then is Swadhishtana.

04:17.288 --> 04:21.639
Now, this Swadhishthana is moving like that.

04:22.917 --> 04:26.733
Right? And then comes the Nabhi.

04:27.157 --> 04:28.157
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

04:28.358 --> 04:29.941
So these are the incarnations here.

04:30.142 --> 04:33.579
Now the Nabhi incarnation is Virata, is here.

04:33.780 --> 04:35.565
SY: They all go up till the pitha - I know.

04:35.766 --> 04:37.960
SM: I mean, like this they open out.

04:38.161 --> 04:40.637
So Mooladhara becomes Christ.

04:40.838 --> 04:44.179
Then, you get this Swadhishthana.

04:44.380 --> 04:49.798
Swadhishtana we have got the incarnations like Ali,

04:49.999 --> 04:52.262
SY: Yes.
SM: He's one of them.

04:52.816 --> 04:56.172
Or you can say all these “Nath Panthis” and all.

04:56.377 --> 05:00.335
Then comes the... third chakra is Nabhi.

05:00.536 --> 05:02.706
Nabhi is Lakshmi Narayana.

05:02.907 --> 05:06.355
So they are expressed here, as Virat.

05:06.560 --> 05:09.570
Now ultimately you come to Heart. Heart is here.

05:09.771 --> 05:11.600
SY: O.k. Jai Shri Mataji.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.820
Now, I see!

05:14.017 --> 05:16.332
SM: So there is only one for heart.

05:16.533 --> 05:20.198
Because at that point they meet.
BM: Yes.

05:26.556 --> 05:29.390
When you get diabetes,

05:29.591 --> 05:32.691
what happens is, of course Swadhishtana is here also.

05:32.902 --> 05:35.665
This is the “Nath Panthi”, right?

05:35.856 --> 05:38.908
But here at the back what happens, when you get diabetes,

05:39.109 --> 05:41.400
your Swadhishtana [is there].

05:41.601 --> 05:45.613
And the Swadhishtana is surrounding the Mooladhara in the brain -

05:45.814 --> 05:48.716
on top, so it presses.

05:48.917 --> 05:53.816
And that’s how you get problems with the eyes in diabetes.

06:00.003 --> 06:02.677
So if you put ice -

06:02.878 --> 06:06.128
if your liver is bad also, you get problems of eyes.

06:06.329 --> 06:10.905
So you put ice on that, on the back side, your eyes can be cured.

06:11.620 --> 06:14.459
For diabetes, simply put ice on the liver

06:14.660 --> 06:15.904
and ice here (on the back Agnya).

06:16.105 --> 06:21.967
But also there is a little touch of left in diseases like that.

06:22.168 --> 06:26.244
Because, after all diabetes is caused by the left organs.

06:27.544 --> 06:31.364
So you have to use lemons also.

06:32.846 --> 06:36.820
You know, [after use], throw them away.

06:37.021 --> 06:39.786
For diseases like that. For liver you don’t have to -

06:39.987 --> 06:41.624
liver is on the right side.

06:41.825 --> 06:46.140
For right side organs you don’t have to use.

06:46.341 --> 06:49.517
But even I have seen, if you get asthma,

06:49.718 --> 06:51.718
that is also the right side,

06:51.919 --> 06:54.520
but little bit triggered by the left.

06:54.721 --> 06:56.056
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

06:56.257 --> 06:58.390
SM: So no use using lemon all the time,

06:58.591 --> 07:01.005
I mean whatever disease may be, right or left.

07:01.206 --> 07:05.325
But in some places is just left - mental cases.

07:05.526 --> 07:09.623
Then you have to only work on lemons, left side, light.

07:09.824 --> 07:15.455
When it is right side, then you have to use only water.

07:15.656 --> 07:18.517
When it is left side you have to use the light.

07:18.718 --> 07:21.513
SY: When it's left side, we have to use the light

07:21.714 --> 07:25.390
And the right side, you have to use the water.

07:25.893 --> 07:27.171
So it's only the left hand,

07:27.372 --> 07:30.120
left sided people get right side diseases

07:30.321 --> 07:32.458
and the right sided people get left diseases?

07:32.659 --> 07:34.645
Is that the manifestation Shri Mataji?

07:34.846 --> 07:36.276
SM: No.
SY: Not necessarily!

07:36.477 --> 07:39.344
SM: You see, right sided people get first of all the liver.

07:39.545 --> 07:40.545
SY: Yes.

07:40.776 --> 07:46.046
SM: As a result, the liver has to excrete its heat into the

07:48.095 --> 07:49.739
blood stream.

07:49.940 --> 07:51.770
But it does not.

07:51.971 --> 07:56.815
So what happens that that heat passes upwards or downwards.

07:58.132 --> 08:02.238
So, when it goes upwards, it causes asthma to the lungs.

08:02.439 --> 08:05.134
When it goes downwards

08:05.335 --> 08:08.072
also the coagulation of the kidneys take place.

08:08.273 --> 08:11.282
So problems of kidneys start - you cannot pass urine.

08:11.483 --> 08:14.998
If it is goes further also you get constipation.

08:15.649 --> 08:20.032
But if it passes on the sides, then you get a massive heart attack.

08:20.233 --> 08:23.824
Supposing a person is drinking very early in age

08:24.025 --> 08:26.177
and also playing very hard games,

08:26.378 --> 08:29.503
he will die at a very young age.

08:31.231 --> 08:34.807
Now, the left sided problems are more mental.

08:35.008 --> 08:39.192
They are depressant, they are sulky.

08:39.393 --> 08:41.666
SY: They are emotional.
SM: They are unhappy, they are crying.

08:41.867 --> 08:45.356
No, even the people who are right sided can cry.

08:45.696 --> 08:48.811
Because they think they are very miserable, but they are not.

08:49.012 --> 08:50.918
They make everybody miserable.

08:51.119 --> 08:53.566
Right sided people make others miserable

08:53.767 --> 08:57.237
and the left sided people suffer themselves.

08:57.777 --> 09:00.088
SY: All Christians must be left-sided, Shri Mataji.

09:00.289 --> 09:02.215
All Christians should be left sided then.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.297
SM: They try to, but they are not.

09:04.498 --> 09:07.897
Where have you seen them to be kind?

09:08.754 --> 09:12.176
In any country they went with the gun in their hands

09:12.377 --> 09:14.819
and Bible in the other hand.
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

09:15.020 --> 09:17.608
SM: These Christians have killed thousands!

09:20.783 --> 09:24.336
They are not Christians at all. Not at all.

09:25.215 --> 09:29.808
So this is how. Then the psychosomatic comes when both combine.

09:30.009 --> 09:33.894
Like cancer, can be a person, can get it when... SY: Left and right.

09:34.095 --> 09:37.880
SM: ...he uses right side too much, but triggered by left.

09:38.081 --> 09:40.140
So, first always try left for such people,

09:40.341 --> 09:42.433
incurable, any incurable diseases.

09:42.634 --> 09:45.655
Try first left, then the right.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.612
SY: I see.

09:49.712 --> 09:52.174
It means he must start with the light.

09:52.375 --> 09:54.525
SM: I mean, not in everyone if they are right-sided,

09:54.726 --> 09:57.384
but you see, you can see on the...
SY: On the vibrations.

09:57.585 --> 10:00.680
Now supposing you have hot vibrations on the left

10:00.879 --> 10:02.248
then start on that.

10:02.449 --> 10:04.594
Hot vibrations on right - then start on that.

10:04.795 --> 10:08.561
Immediately you will know which one to start first.
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

10:09.153 --> 10:11.008
And you should all get into it.

10:11.215 --> 10:13.943
You see we have got now [Gayakwar].

10:14.144 --> 10:16.301
SY: Yes Shri Mataji.
SM: So good.

10:16.502 --> 10:17.975
SY: He is really...

10:18.176 --> 10:22.364
He describes the house

10:22.565 --> 10:24.169
of a person whom he has never visited

10:24.370 --> 10:26.000
because on vibrations, he can feel that.

10:26.232 --> 10:27.931
He's gone, he's gone so deep.

10:28.132 --> 10:32.832
He can describe the house of a person, whom he has not visited.

10:33.388 --> 10:36.258
SM: Yes. He goes to the right, Baba, that's the problem with him.

10:36.459 --> 10:38.290
He shouldn’t do all these things.

10:38.491 --> 10:40.658
There's no need. Why to describe somebody's house?

10:40.859 --> 10:42.282
I mean it's senseless. SY: Yes.

10:42.483 --> 10:45.070
In Sahaja Yoga you should do whatever is necessary.

10:45.271 --> 10:49.418
Whatever is not necessary why to do it? Describe somebody’s house!

10:49.619 --> 10:52.172
What is the need? SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

10:52.373 --> 10:55.867
He goes right sided. I've told him to stop all these things.

10:56.068 --> 10:58.993
Only just feel the vibrations. That’s all.

10:59.194 --> 11:02.120
Otherwise he'll lose powers.

11:02.751 --> 11:05.257
You better tell him once he shouldn't do all these things.

11:05.458 --> 11:08.151
I've told him already.
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

11:08.352 --> 11:12.656
We had one fellow like that and he went so much to the right

11:12.857 --> 11:16.824
and unfortunately he met one Scientologist lady.

11:17.025 --> 11:21.325
And then he just vomited blood, vomited blood and died.

11:22.728 --> 11:26.345
SY: It is again an imbalance Shri Mataji - misusing the power.

11:26.546 --> 11:30.011
SM: No, no, you go to the right - sees futures!

11:30.392 --> 11:32.811
So why? You just see this.

11:33.012 --> 11:35.359
What is the need to see this... somebody’s house?

11:35.560 --> 11:39.728
One should try to understand - what is the need

11:41.076 --> 11:44.187
to do unnecessary things?

11:44.900 --> 11:47.075
How many unnecessary things we do?

11:47.276 --> 11:50.595
I mean, we are like monkeys, I tell you, in a way.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.988
SY: That You were saying Shri Mataji once, that

11:54.197 --> 11:58.168
our, our ancestors have left a permanent imprint on us.

11:58.369 --> 12:00.975
I remember You have said.
SM: I mean unnecessarily as monkeys

12:01.176 --> 12:02.714
will go on doing things and all.

12:02.915 --> 12:04.622
We too [unclear]. We are copycats like them.

12:04.823 --> 12:06.757
Absolutely we are copycats.

12:06.958 --> 12:10.063
Once a monkey came into our room.

12:10.264 --> 12:13.035
We are staying in somebody’s house, upstairs.

12:13.236 --> 12:15.639
And it took a pair of C.P. ’s - one shoe.

12:15.840 --> 12:17.306
And C.P. got quite worried,

12:17.505 --> 12:20.007
"Now what to do?" It has taken [unclear] - one shoe.

12:20.208 --> 12:22.938
This is very easy. I took another shoe and put it on the ground.

12:23.139 --> 12:25.982
He also put it on the ground.

12:26.549 --> 12:29.026
Brainless creatures.

12:29.833 --> 12:33.482
And that’s how we follow fashions, because we are brainless.

12:33.683 --> 12:36.466
Monkey brands.

12:38.460 --> 12:41.710
But Hanumana had wisdom.

12:43.745 --> 12:48.297
Hanumana was a monkey which shot up because of His wisdom.

12:48.506 --> 12:53.379
We are still monkeys and fools! [Folly] pets I think!

12:55.462 --> 13:00.162
Why to do unnecessary things? Just, it’s not necessary.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.562
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji

13:03.629 --> 13:06.709
SM: That’s all - very simple.

13:09.831 --> 13:12.632
SY: And wisdom will tell you as to what is necessary

13:12.833 --> 13:15.004
and what is not necessary.
SM: Of course, vibrations are there.

13:15.205 --> 13:18.302
SY: Vibrations will tell you, Shri Mataji.

13:28.009 --> 13:31.847
SM: That at least, minimum you have is wisdom.

13:32.347 --> 13:34.785
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

13:34.986 --> 13:37.785
If you people don't even get your wisdom,

13:37.986 --> 13:41.170
what’s the use of coming to Sahaja yoga? If you are still a donkey

13:41.371 --> 13:44.154
it’s better not to come to Sahaja Yoga - this is the point, you see.

13:44.355 --> 13:46.484
At least ask for wisdom.

13:46.685 --> 13:48.595
[But that's not so] - what they do,

13:48.796 --> 13:50.857
as soon as they come they want assert themselves,

13:51.058 --> 13:52.381
"I am something", you know.

13:52.582 --> 13:56.007
SM: I say: "Big pot".
SY: I say: "Big pot he is".

13:56.208 --> 13:59.363
SY: Shri Mataji, would it be proper to conclude that, for that,

13:59.564 --> 14:03.653
the culmination of pure knowledge is wisdom, in Sahaja Yoga?

14:03.860 --> 14:05.140
SM: What is the?

14:05.320 --> 14:09.260
SY: The culmination of pure knowledge is wisdom, Shri Mataji?

14:09.460 --> 14:13.020
SM: No, wisdom is the symptom of it.

14:13.230 --> 14:16.910
SY: It’s a symptom of that. Oh, I see! It’s reverse.

14:17.111 --> 14:19.449
SM: Effect.

14:26.393 --> 14:28.153
But also you have the wisdom to see

14:28.354 --> 14:30.585
what is necessary, what is not necessary.

14:30.786 --> 14:33.116
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.
SM: You just do what is necessary.

14:33.317 --> 14:36.597
SY: Because, even if it feels , as they say knowledge has come,

14:36.798 --> 14:38.983
they say the wisdom is lingering.

14:39.184 --> 14:43.150
Because if you are not wise and your knowledgeable

14:43.351 --> 14:46.071
that is useless.

14:48.360 --> 14:51.651
SM: So that’s what I say is yoga without knowledge is useless

14:51.852 --> 14:54.859
and knowledge without yoga is useless.

14:55.420 --> 14:57.318
SY: I see.

15:01.598 --> 15:04.091
Wisdom is something which is within ourselves, you see,

15:04.292 --> 15:06.580
only it’s like an ocean,

15:06.781 --> 15:09.233
only thing you have to get into it.

15:09.434 --> 15:11.844
It’s a symptom of that knowledge,

15:12.045 --> 15:15.898
or you can say is the projection or the light.

15:17.402 --> 15:20.220
But you are not worldly wise,

15:20.421 --> 15:23.197
you don't, you are not meticulous,

15:23.398 --> 15:27.962
but you are in that ocean so the ocean looks after.

15:28.163 --> 15:31.972
The ocean has the wisdom, no doubt of it.

15:32.353 --> 15:35.850
And you accept it, you see, that "All right,

15:36.051 --> 15:38.996
this was to be, all right, doesn’t matter."

15:39.455 --> 15:41.938
Let it go on!

15:43.261 --> 15:44.871
Don’t get frustrated with it.

15:45.072 --> 15:47.222
Just say, "All right, this was the part of the game".

15:47.423 --> 15:51.403
Like we have lots of [funny], horrible things in this Australia.

15:51.604 --> 15:55.124
One after another they are cleared out.

15:56.689 --> 16:01.255
Some were really unwise people, extremely unwise.

16:01.512 --> 16:03.985
So they went away.

16:15.388 --> 16:17.214
SY: I think you would required wisdom

16:17.415 --> 16:20.124
even to understand what vibrations are saying, Shri Mataji.

16:20.325 --> 16:22.499
SM: Np, you have to have just vibrations, Baba, that's

16:22.700 --> 16:24.709
so innately built within you.

16:24.910 --> 16:28.228
We don’t need any wisdom to see things through our eyes.

16:28.429 --> 16:31.117
It’s your awareness now.

16:32.745 --> 16:35.111
SY: But we... Don’t we have to go to mental level to...?

16:35.312 --> 16:36.803
SM: No, no, not at all.
SY: Not at all.

16:37.004 --> 16:39.572
SM: No need. You know already what it is now.

16:39.773 --> 16:42.020
Immediately you will know what’s wrong with this person,

16:42.228 --> 16:46.370
what’s wrong with that person, what’s wrong with you.

16:47.520 --> 16:51.057
But the problem in the West is this thing, you see. Two...

16:51.438 --> 16:53.797
Double type - in India and different here.

16:53.998 --> 16:57.583
Here they say, “Yes I have ego. All right, so what?"

16:58.298 --> 16:59.580
As simple.

16:59.781 --> 17:01.740
In India, they'll say, “No, I don’t have ego”!

17:01.941 --> 17:04.769
I mean, both ways it’s just the same.

17:04.970 --> 17:07.723
Here they just come out: "Yes, I have terrible ego Mother.

17:07.924 --> 17:09.947
I know, I have terrible ego."

17:10.148 --> 17:13.611
Then you start looking, "[Wrong but] true!"

17:15.448 --> 17:17.673
They'll just confess.

17:17.874 --> 17:19.489
SY: It's ego's idea, of course.

17:19.690 --> 17:22.035
SM: Yes, I know... Yes, of course, ego is quite intact.

17:22.236 --> 17:24.317
But, you see, they say it.

17:24.518 --> 17:26.738
In India they would never say such a thing, you know?

17:26.939 --> 17:30.536
They would never say such a thing - never. They'll never accept.

17:30.737 --> 17:34.416
They never feel guilty, can you imagine these Indians?

17:34.626 --> 17:37.518
We have quite shameless people there (in India).

17:42.148 --> 17:45.434
I got a letter about Patrice - many - and I asked him,

17:45.635 --> 17:46.798
from Finland.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.922
I said, “Patrice, there is so much complaints about you”.

17:50.123 --> 17:55.050
“Yes Mother, I have a terrible ego. I know that - terrible”.

17:57.834 --> 18:01.667
I didn’t know what to say to him after that.

18:03.010 --> 18:06.373
Here, people will shamelessly tell you.

18:07.154 --> 18:09.760
In India people are shameless and they will never accept.

18:09.961 --> 18:13.540
And here people will tell you shamelessly.

18:14.810 --> 18:18.127
SY: Because it’s considered to be social taboo, Shri Mataji,

18:18.328 --> 18:20.657
to be egoistic in India, I think.

18:20.858 --> 18:23.740
I mean, a bad we'll be said the “garvishtha”.

18:23.941 --> 18:26.223
Is that something we say? Garvishtha, garvishtha.

18:26.424 --> 18:28.801
SM: I know that in our place, you see,

18:29.002 --> 18:33.082
is such a, so many stuff good manners and social taboos.

18:33.514 --> 18:36.376
I mean, we'll never say to somebody “I hate you”, can we?

18:36.586 --> 18:39.721
Does anyone say in Marathi "I hate you"? BM: If someone says "I hate you" then that's it.

18:39.922 --> 18:41.151
SM: I mean, imagine.

18:41.352 --> 18:45.185
I would regard him as a mad man or something - is absolutely stupid.

18:45.386 --> 18:47.704
SY: So it will be so uncultured the statement...

18:47.920 --> 18:50.757
This will be considered, it will be considered a very uncultured statement.

18:50.958 --> 18:52.715
SM: SM: Uncool. But they are never going to say that ever.

18:52.916 --> 18:55.500
SY: Yes, we will not say also, because, because of the taboo...

18:55.701 --> 18:57.587
SM: The social taboo.
SY: The social taboo.

18:57.788 --> 19:00.194
SM:(Bhayankar= excessive) good manners are ingrained in Indians.

19:00.395 --> 19:02.912
But here invariably they say "I hate you",

19:03.113 --> 19:05.555
"I hate you, I hate this, I hate that" -

19:05.756 --> 19:08.250
all the time.

19:08.779 --> 19:10.982
SY: Yeah, there is, there are only two stages,

19:11.183 --> 19:15.684
either you hate somebody or you like somebody.

19:22.825 --> 19:25.489
SM:  How can they use the word "hate" so easily?

19:25.690 --> 19:28.340
In our place, imagine, if somebody says like that, the father will beat him.

19:28.541 --> 19:30.552
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

19:31.628 --> 19:33.580
SM: Here, they will say "darling" to anyone,

19:33.781 --> 19:36.563
they will say "I love you" to anyone.

19:38.224 --> 19:40.743
In India they will do it secretly, openly they will never do it.

19:40.934 --> 19:42.036
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji

19:42.237 --> 19:45.945
SY: And again it has a bearing...
SM: Yes, on the social taboos.

19:46.146 --> 19:48.537
Whether they'll hate you like a snake,

19:48.744 --> 19:51.370
they'll never openly say so.

19:52.996 --> 19:57.260
That’s India. That’s another extreme.This is another extreme.

20:01.199 --> 20:03.856
But if you have ego why not correct it?

20:04.057 --> 20:07.682
Thank God you know you have ego, so why not correct it?

20:09.492 --> 20:12.173
SY: Here Mother, if, it's almost to the point,

20:12.374 --> 20:14.876
if you hate somebody you put in advertisement in the newspaper

20:15.077 --> 20:16.838
so everybody knows it.

20:17.039 --> 20:18.259
SM: Is it so?

20:18.460 --> 20:20.652
SY: It's not quite, but...
SY: Yes.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.269
SM: I mean nobody will say.
SY: [Then amounting to]!

20:23.470 --> 20:27.671
SM: But if you hate someone, supposing, I'm taking another view,

20:27.872 --> 20:31.251
central view - now, supposing you hate someone...

20:31.452 --> 20:34.201
So what? Who are you? What’s your authority?

20:34.402 --> 20:35.894
SY: That's right.

20:36.095 --> 20:37.505
You hate, so hate, go ahead…

20:37.706 --> 20:40.875
SY: And that again, it’s a product of ego Shri Mataji! Hating...

20:41.076 --> 20:42.506
SM: I hate you.
SY: I hate!

20:42.707 --> 20:44.640
I hate - so it’s a product of ego.

20:44.841 --> 20:47.015
SM: Who are you? I mean, you hate.

20:47.216 --> 20:50.239
O.k., what does it matter? I mean, who are you?

20:50.440 --> 20:53.874
Authority - what is your authority saying "I hate you"?

20:54.075 --> 20:56.784
SY: So the reply, should be: "Go and jump in the sea".

20:56.985 --> 21:00.475
SM: Or, should be that, "As you do, I do".

21:03.382 --> 21:07.263
But that won’t be wise. Just to say that "All right, I had enough".

21:07.464 --> 21:09.962
SY: But in Marathi, how do we say, Shri Mataji? "Same to you".

21:10.163 --> 21:13.310
SM: Same to you!

21:17.163 --> 21:22.243
Marathi language is only humor, humor, humor.

21:22.553 --> 21:25.299
SY: It's the same with this forgiveness thing, isn't it Shri Mataji?

21:25.500 --> 21:27.641
I mean, who are, who are we not to forgive?

21:27.842 --> 21:29.953
What are we doing when we don't forgive?

21:30.154 --> 21:32.494
It's the same what are we doing when we hate. I mean,

21:32.695 --> 21:33.698
it's all here.

21:33.899 --> 21:36.799
SM: I mean there's nothing that you do: hate only. But...

21:37.000 --> 21:38.974
you see, at least when you say I don't forgive,

21:39.175 --> 21:41.919
you have a right about yourself: that you forgive or don't forgive.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.633
But if you hate, what right have you got to hate anyone?

21:44.834 --> 21:48.428
And even if you hate, who, who cares for you are hating?

21:49.041 --> 21:51.462
You are not God, that you hate me and it means

21:51.663 --> 21:53.907
it has a meaning or has any purpose

21:54.108 --> 21:55.743
or has an effect.

21:55.944 --> 21:59.831
And the Christians, pardon me, Shri Mataji, are forbidden,

22:00.032 --> 22:02.655
both for, for forgiving or for hating,

22:02.856 --> 22:07.387
because both these places they acquire the status of judgment.

22:07.888 --> 22:10.063
In both the cases, they are judging.

22:10.264 --> 22:12.409
And there is prohibition for judgment in..

22:12.610 --> 22:13.997
SM: But forgiving, yes...

22:14.198 --> 22:16.889
SY: Even forgiving you are judging, Shri Mataji.

22:17.090 --> 22:20.370
You are judging that: "I, I have judged you

22:20.571 --> 22:22.865
and I have forgiven you".

22:23.638 --> 22:26.575
SM: It's all just in the head!

22:26.776 --> 22:29.835
Keeping in the head, all right.

22:30.090 --> 22:32.281
So they are so anti-Christian qualities.

22:32.482 --> 22:34.853
SM: Oh, this you pour here. That way.

22:37.322 --> 22:38.770
It’s all anti-Christian, Baba.

22:38.971 --> 22:41.244
It's all anti-Hindu, anti-Christian, anti-Muslim.

22:41.445 --> 22:45.459
SY: It's anti-God, Shri Mataji.
SM: It's all anti-God.

22:46.524 --> 22:50.147
We should relate to One - the Absolute -

22:50.607 --> 22:52.500
otherwise is all absurd.

22:52.701 --> 22:55.787
What is the criteria

22:55.988 --> 22:59.842
for this kind of different, different types of things

23:00.043 --> 23:02.384
that people have?

23:02.585 --> 23:04.326
Means division undivided.

23:04.527 --> 23:07.830
There should be no difference.

23:09.193 --> 23:10.917
SY: Because God has made no difference

23:11.118 --> 23:13.933
between human being and human being, Shri Mataji.

23:14.134 --> 23:16.635
SM: He has just varieties, that's all.

23:16.836 --> 23:19.878
Variety is important, otherwise we will be bored stiff, you see?

23:20.079 --> 23:22.496
To see all of us that's the same, imagine?

23:22.697 --> 23:25.115
How it would look?

23:27.256 --> 23:30.525
SY: Shri Mataji, even the animals would be having this variety.

23:30.726 --> 23:33.695
I mean, supposing there is tiger and there is another tiger.

23:33.896 --> 23:35.661
SM: Yes, but they are under control of God.

23:35.844 --> 23:37.064
They are "pashu", aren't they?

23:37.265 --> 23:39.235
in the "Paash" (leash) - control of God.

23:39.436 --> 23:41.692
They don’t have problem of sin at all.

23:41.893 --> 23:44.738
A tiger can go and kill any cow, eat it nicely,

23:44.939 --> 23:47.033
leave it for others to eat.

23:47.234 --> 23:50.066
He doesn’t think he has committed any sin.

23:50.267 --> 23:52.126
It's only the human being in their freedom

23:52.327 --> 23:55.369
think they are committing sins.

24:03.485 --> 24:06.300
So for human beings,

24:06.501 --> 24:08.354
the second stage,

24:08.555 --> 24:11.438
first the stage of animals is

24:11.639 --> 24:15.830
to be completely under the control of Divine.

24:16.837 --> 24:19.334
And then the second stage is:

24:19.535 --> 24:22.338
human beings where they have freedom to choose.

24:22.539 --> 24:28.832
And then, in their own freedom, they should control

24:30.306 --> 24:32.172
their divinity, which they have got it.

24:32.373 --> 24:35.707
Control means they should be under the divinity that they have got,

24:35.908 --> 24:37.748
the light that they have got.

24:37.949 --> 24:41.620
But here they are aware. Animals are not aware.

24:42.620 --> 24:46.346
In our awareness we have to

24:46.850 --> 24:49.838
know that we are free

24:51.675 --> 24:54.486
and surrendered.

24:54.904 --> 24:57.915
This is the difference is. So in three stages we [move],

24:58.116 --> 25:02.183
from animal, human and then to superhuman.

25:16.118 --> 25:19.799
Any confession in the West, Baba, is so horrifying.

25:20.016 --> 25:23.129
You can’t read them, really.

25:23.361 --> 25:26.382
I used to get piles and piles of letters and would burn them.

25:26.583 --> 25:28.646
Confessions are the worst thing.

25:28.847 --> 25:32.035
It's coming from Catholic church I think.

25:32.977 --> 25:37.955
"Confessing my past life". Who is interested in your past life?

25:38.156 --> 25:40.412
Piles and piles of letters.

25:40.613 --> 25:42.177
"Mother I did this, I did"...

25:42.378 --> 25:46.784
I mean I just don’t want to know about it - finished.

25:48.855 --> 25:51.701
I am here for cleansing.

25:55.912 --> 25:59.832
Right, right hand, put your left like this.

26:00.038 --> 26:02.820
Put right straight.

26:04.440 --> 26:07.597
After some time it shakes.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.736
And they say, "I have 'bhoots'".

26:17.937 --> 26:20.455
They will also say that, “Mother I have got a bhoot in me" –

26:20.656 --> 26:23.137
there's no harm".

26:25.865 --> 26:29.580
"I am negative” - that’s all. Then what do you do?

26:29.781 --> 26:33.016
I mean it's a confession of a thief, you know.

26:34.142 --> 26:38.683
It’s very difficult for Me to deal with them, then.

26:38.925 --> 26:41.053
So they have confessed, so what?

26:41.254 --> 26:44.446
It’s a Christian idea: that as long as you confess it to a priest,

26:44.647 --> 26:46.653
you are out of it.
SY: Yes, your sins is lost.

26:46.854 --> 26:51.161
SY: Because their idea is that Christ had come to wash your sins.

26:51.362 --> 26:55.669
And if you come clean, then He will be doing, doing the...

26:55.870 --> 26:57.958
He will be laundering your sins, you see.

26:58.159 --> 27:01.287
SM: Same with Me, but there is no need to confess.

27:01.488 --> 27:02.704
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

27:02.905 --> 27:04.120
SM: Not necessary.

27:04.321 --> 27:06.280
I know already whatever is there.

27:06.481 --> 27:09.920
But by confession, you say: "I have now confessed it". So what?

27:10.121 --> 27:11.682
SY: "So I am free.

27:11.873 --> 27:15.412
I have got a clean [slate] for another set of sins."

27:17.757 --> 27:21.740
SY: "Yes, I have to make room for the next lots".

27:23.108 --> 27:25.992
SM: You have to go to the end of Feet.

27:32.843 --> 27:35.416
All right. May God bless you.

27:37.565 --> 27:39.686
Now, don’t feel guilty.

27:39.887 --> 27:43.073
Little bit probably, but don't feel guilty.

27:45.504 --> 27:46.737
Let's go. It's done.

27:46.938 --> 27:49.207
I will get ready. We have to go now.

27:49.408 --> 27:51.215
Still little time.

27:53.472 --> 27:57.712
But otherwise, you see, it’s working out very well, I must say.

27:57.963 --> 27:59.185
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

27:59.386 --> 28:02.169
I never expected, Baba, in My life time to see all this,

28:02.370 --> 28:04.552
really, to be very frank.

28:05.254 --> 28:08.043
So I'm very happy.

28:08.244 --> 28:12.507
And the more you open out the vision, the more you will see

28:14.365 --> 28:17.049
and more see the peripheries also.

28:17.240 --> 28:20.017
It's very encouraging,

28:21.775 --> 28:26.049
that so many can see so clearly and know,

28:26.250 --> 28:28.732
and I can talk to them.

28:31.180 --> 28:34.377
Imagine Christ talking to these people there,

28:34.568 --> 28:36.735
to the multitudes.

28:37.249 --> 28:41.283
I used to say mule-titudes. Mules -

28:42.318 --> 28:44.142
talk to the mules.

28:44.343 --> 28:47.507
And they crucified Him, very nicely.

28:48.326 --> 28:51.369
I mean, just think of that.

29:10.763 --> 29:13.083
Later, when they accept this article,

29:13.284 --> 29:15.789
we will write about them, about Andha Shraddha (blind faith).

29:15.996 --> 29:17.813
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

29:19.473 --> 29:22.798
SM: I will definitely write an article before leaving.

29:33.682 --> 29:37.622
I think there is already an article written about.

29:39.460 --> 29:42.217
SY: They started their activity, Shri Mataji,

29:42.418 --> 29:46.282
because of the gullible rural people.

29:46.483 --> 29:49.094
And they, they also did not want to

29:49.295 --> 29:52.157
bring into their folds the real gurus.

29:52.358 --> 29:54.532
But now they have become so successful

29:54.740 --> 29:57.841
and the succes is given, I mean triggered out their ego.

29:58.042 --> 30:00.490
So now they are taking everywhere.
SM: No, no, not everywhere. Not everywhere.

30:00.691 --> 30:05.293
Recently, there was an article in this "Police Times" (Marathi newspaper).

30:06.809 --> 30:12.844
that Andha Shraddha Nirmulan has been blasted.

30:13.045 --> 30:14.320
And she wrote that.

30:14.521 --> 30:19.850
There was a lady who was taking out these: kumkum and this and that.

30:20.051 --> 30:22.469
And they said, "We'll give you 2 lakhs if you show us".

30:22.670 --> 30:25.769
And she showed them. They never gave her 2 lakhs.

30:25.970 --> 30:27.661
So it was all reported.

30:27.862 --> 30:30.396
Then [Methani] answered that very beautifully,

30:30.607 --> 30:32.391
that, "All these things are done, no doubt.

30:32.592 --> 30:34.518
I also went to a guru like that and I suffered a lot

30:34.719 --> 30:35.948
and all those things, but,

30:36.149 --> 30:38.200
these things are not good, they should not be followed.

30:38.401 --> 30:40.563
What you you have to follow is Sahaja Yoga" - like that.

30:40.764 --> 30:43.194
Very good article came.

30:43.395 --> 30:48.162
So, you see, they have been successful in some cases -

30:48.363 --> 30:53.828
where it has been really something wrong, they could find out -

30:54.029 --> 30:56.074
very few cases like this.

30:56.275 --> 30:59.035
But they went up to a hill where there was a lady

30:59.236 --> 31:02.940
who was supposed to be curing or something whatever it is,

31:03.141 --> 31:05.715
and they burnt her hut - they [breed/buried] all this,

31:05.882 --> 31:07.544
they are very violent people.

31:07.745 --> 31:11.671
If they don’t find anything they just go amok.

31:13.655 --> 31:15.582
SY: Yes.

31:18.690 --> 31:20.532
SM: Now, the Christian missionaries,

31:20.733 --> 31:22.779
they have been successful because

31:22.980 --> 31:27.955
nobody is allowed to propagate religion, like this, in India.

31:28.156 --> 31:29.371
So they were successful.

31:29.572 --> 31:31.484
SY: Yes.

31:32.933 --> 31:35.280
SY: They were showing a television, on Babhulkar,

31:35.481 --> 31:37.350
they were showing him on television.

31:37.551 --> 31:39.663
SM: Yes because, because of Sharad Pawar.

31:39.864 --> 31:44.985
SY: Yes. He had shown in some instances, where you know, in...

31:46.123 --> 31:48.741
South of Maharashtra there is a village

31:48.942 --> 31:52.185
and they believe - all of them in the village believe that

31:52.386 --> 31:53.940
in a particular temple,

31:54.160 --> 31:57.342
that at a particular day, on a particular day if they go

31:57.543 --> 32:01.318
and hit their head to the wall of the temple,

32:01.519 --> 32:02.632
then they will be blessed.

32:02.833 --> 32:04.639
SM: No, no, what I am saying, anything like that,

32:04.840 --> 32:06.323
now we had “Devadasis”,

32:06.524 --> 32:11.383
we had the problem of [“Nathvara”] -

32:11.584 --> 32:12.948
all these problems were there.

32:13.149 --> 32:15.630
You see, there were some gurus who were doing wrong things.

32:15.831 --> 32:18.556
But they were all corrected by government, not by a... like that.

32:18.757 --> 32:21.031
SY: Yes, therefore, therefore there are laws for this.

32:21.232 --> 32:22.375
SM: There are laws for that.

32:22.576 --> 32:24.975
They have, they have no business to take law into their hand.

32:25.176 --> 32:26.120
SY: Absolutely.

32:26.321 --> 32:28.425
SM: This is the point I am trying to make.
SY: That's right, Shri Mataji.

32:28.626 --> 32:31.064
If the government comes forward we’ll  talk to them.

32:31.265 --> 32:32.407
SY: Yes...

32:32.608 --> 32:35.606
And best they can, they can go to the government

32:35.807 --> 32:37.547
and say that this is what is happening.

32:37.748 --> 32:39.151
But they cannot do themselves.

32:39.352 --> 32:42.243
SM: They cannot do. You see the...

32:42.444 --> 32:45.035
the AIG police Pune came to see Me

32:45.236 --> 32:46.964
and it said they have no right to do it.

32:47.165 --> 32:48.165
SY: Absolutely.

32:48.366 --> 32:50.869
And then we have to send the police here and the police there.

32:51.070 --> 32:54.226
I mean they have no bases, but this is Sharad Pawar.

32:54.427 --> 32:58.902
And Rajneesh - Rajneesh has started this organisation,

33:02.526 --> 33:05.179
to create problems. They have no right.

33:05.380 --> 33:08.230
Rajneesh made fun of all the deities, everything

33:08.431 --> 33:13.019
and told that these people worship [Gods] and things like that.

33:21.813 --> 33:25.395
SY: Rajneesh, his very existence, Shri Mataji,

33:25.596 --> 33:28.039
is challenged because of Sahaja Yoga, because...

33:28.240 --> 33:30.130
SM: That’s true, but what he has done,

33:30.331 --> 33:33.214
he has paid the money to start this organisation.

33:33.415 --> 33:37.149
Now, last, last two-three years they are there.

33:37.350 --> 33:40.464
SY: Initially he was not interested in what we were doing, Shri Mataji.

33:40.665 --> 33:42.933
Only when Sahaja Yoga picked up, then...

33:43.134 --> 33:45.441
SM: No, initially also they tried to trouble us

33:45.642 --> 33:47.661
long time back, in [Israel] country.

33:47.862 --> 33:49.692
SY: Rajneesh's people?
SM: No, [unclear].

33:49.893 --> 33:51.356
SY: [unclear], I see.
SM: They hit us.

33:51.557 --> 33:55.272
But they told us we are from "Jnana probhodhini".

33:55.473 --> 33:59.155
When we inquired, they said, "We have nothing to do with these people".

33:59.356 --> 34:00.845
They are all drunkards.

34:01.046 --> 34:05.187
SY: Oh yes, they drink, most of them drink so much.

34:06.181 --> 34:09.914
SM: So they are showing Dabholkar. Why not Me?

34:10.801 --> 34:12.616
Another thing Baba, you have to take up with,

34:12.817 --> 34:15.073
is with the communication minister.

34:15.274 --> 34:16.472
Same person.

34:16.673 --> 34:19.154
That how could this Paranzape go there, Ram Paranzape,

34:19.355 --> 34:21.489
to that remote village to film Me?

34:21.690 --> 34:26.106
Why the whole of this television working for these people?

34:26.307 --> 34:27.786
Who are they?

34:27.987 --> 34:30.590
SY: How did he know that such an event is going to take place?

34:30.791 --> 34:33.846
SM: No. no, they are working for him. They always project.

34:34.047 --> 34:36.311
Shyam Manav was all the time there,

34:36.512 --> 34:39.120
and this fellow was all the time there, Dabholkar and this...

34:39.321 --> 34:42.350
SY: Shyam Manav was there?
SM: Yes, on the film.

34:42.551 --> 34:44.053
SY: Was he there in the... ?

34:44.254 --> 34:45.747
SM: He was not there but on the...

34:45.948 --> 34:48.130
they show him too much on the television.

34:48.331 --> 34:50.014
SY: Yes.

34:51.800 --> 34:55.027
SM: So we should meet these central government people on television

34:55.228 --> 34:59.200
and why is it so much importance giving to this organization?

34:59.430 --> 35:03.350
And what they said that they will go and open the

35:03.530 --> 35:06.970
Samadhi of Gyaneshwara to see if he really

35:07.150 --> 35:10.690
went inside or not, to see if there are bones inside or not.

35:10.901 --> 35:12.745
SY: Yes.

35:15.729 --> 35:18.701
SY: In fact Andha Shraddha Nirmulan should be the first

35:18.902 --> 35:21.173
to join Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji, because Sahaja Yoga..

35:21.374 --> 35:23.775
SM: I have done so much on this Shraddha Nirmulan.
SY: Yes.

35:23.976 --> 35:25.176
SM: But what I am saying that

35:25.377 --> 35:27.902
how they have got such authority you should ask.

35:28.103 --> 35:30.346
SY: Then they don't have, they have no authority Shri Mataji.

35:30.547 --> 35:32.754
SM: That’s what - we challenged their authority legally.

35:32.955 --> 35:33.955
SY: Yes, of course.

35:34.156 --> 35:36.129
SM: You see, if the government sees anything wrong,..

35:36.330 --> 35:37.925
And also you should ask these TV people,

35:38.126 --> 35:41.285
why are they giving so much importance to them?

35:41.486 --> 35:43.610
They have brought Shyam Manav so many times there,

35:43.811 --> 35:47.793
They have got this Dhabolkar there. Why? Who is he?

35:47.994 --> 35:51.698
Just an ordinary doctor, a non-practicing doctor.

35:52.357 --> 35:54.309
They are the ones who are giving him publicity.

35:54.510 --> 35:56.771
They said Shri Mataji is doing a perfect publicity,

35:56.972 --> 35:59.299
but they can't say I am doing it for money.

35:59.500 --> 36:00.830
They can't find it out.

36:01.031 --> 36:03.345
But they are the ones who are seeking publicity,

36:03.546 --> 36:06.415
so these people should be, another point, it's very important.

36:06.616 --> 36:08.628
You must go and see the central government and ask them how is it?

36:08.818 --> 36:10.166
and ask them how is it?

36:10.367 --> 36:12.380
SY: That they are showing them on TV.
SM: Communication matter.

36:12.605 --> 36:14.849
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

36:19.681 --> 36:22.828
Delhi people are little bit haphazard.

36:23.029 --> 36:24.765
Let them form a committee for this.

36:24.966 --> 36:28.457
SY: Yes Shri Mataji, I will go and meet them all.

36:28.831 --> 36:30.968
SM: They are going to see him tomorrow

36:31.169 --> 36:33.647
this gentlemen, the Home minister.

36:33.848 --> 36:37.662
Is he also dealing with the communications? They said so?

36:37.863 --> 36:40.656
SY: No idea, Shri Mataji, those ministers have been changing.

36:40.857 --> 36:45.321
SM: So this felow, is he, he's a, he is great friend of Yashwant Sinha.

36:45.522 --> 36:48.112
SY: What's his name, Shri Mataji? Sahaya?

36:48.313 --> 36:49.463
SM: Sahaya.

36:49.664 --> 36:51.283
SY: Sahaya.

36:51.484 --> 36:52.949
There have been so many.

36:53.150 --> 36:56.002
SM: But you better, you see, you should ask,

36:56.203 --> 36:57.950
you should ask them why,

36:58.151 --> 37:01.384
how can these people support this organisation.

37:01.585 --> 37:05.493
What right have they got? Now supposing somebody is a thief.

37:05.694 --> 37:07.810
All right, let the government see to it.

37:08.011 --> 37:11.037
SY: Yes.
SM: Who are you?

37:14.449 --> 37:15.640
Ananda, Andha name...

37:15.841 --> 37:18.300
In the name of Andha Shradha they have tortured many people.

37:18.501 --> 37:21.682
Police are very angry with them because they keep them so busy.

37:21.883 --> 37:23.940
SY: Yes.

37:28.999 --> 37:31.195
SM: The only thing they can do is to bring it

37:31.396 --> 37:33.140
to the notice of the government. SM: Yes, that's all.

37:33.341 --> 37:35.749
SY: That’s all, that’s all.

37:36.514 --> 37:39.801
And that’s their legal right - nothing beyond.

37:40.002 --> 37:42.583
SM: As if they are cheated themselves.
SY: Yes.

37:42.784 --> 37:45.526
SY: And if they take to pelting of stones

37:45.727 --> 37:49.890
or if they take to any violent act it is totally...

37:50.091 --> 37:53.103
SM: That's to be banned.
SY: Yes, it's totally illegal.

37:55.704 --> 37:58.151
SM: This is the point you have to make.

37:58.352 --> 38:01.425
But what should we do now?

38:01.690 --> 38:03.411
When are you going to go?

38:03.612 --> 38:07.790
SY: I am in Delhi on the 23-rd night, Shri Mataji.

38:07.990 --> 38:10.470
But I could stay back and...

38:10.671 --> 38:12.510
SM: Go there and do it.
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

38:12.711 --> 38:14.711
SM: And you should go and meet communication minister.

38:14.902 --> 38:16.302
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

38:16.503 --> 38:18.721
SM: And tell he must pass [such strictness].

38:18.922 --> 38:21.283
How can they show Dhabolkar? Who is he?

38:21.484 --> 38:23.218
SY: Yes.

38:23.419 --> 38:27.074
That means your, your Police department is bekar [useless],

38:27.275 --> 38:30.452
your secret police is there bekar. Everybody is bekar.

38:30.653 --> 38:31.984
He's the only one

38:32.185 --> 38:35.109
most sensible, you know, like a hero in an Indian, in an Indian film.

38:35.310 --> 38:38.161
SY: Yes, all wisdom personified.

38:39.623 --> 38:42.169
SM: So we have to ask some questions.

38:42.370 --> 38:44.589
Already started seeing...

38:44.790 --> 38:46.365
SY: No, these signals, you know.

38:46.566 --> 38:48.839
SM: Now take out your watches, take out your watches.

38:49.040 --> 38:51.856
There's no, is very bad. Don’t see your watches, just take out.

38:52.057 --> 38:53.716
I don’t wear.

38:53.917 --> 38:56.528
I know the time, Myself.

38:56.729 --> 38:59.281
Take out your watches - that makes you mad, you see?

38:59.482 --> 39:01.027
You are very time bound people,

39:01.234 --> 39:03.461
and also slaves of your watches.

39:03.662 --> 39:07.147
We never had watches before. We were quite happy.

39:07.978 --> 39:11.423
Yesterday same thing happened: we had to go to that reception.

39:11.624 --> 39:15.080
She became so nervous, her center heart was catching so badly.

39:15.281 --> 39:16.360
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

39:16.561 --> 39:19.336
SM: And I Myself suggested that we have to go now.

39:19.537 --> 39:21.642
I have a time in My head.

39:21.843 --> 39:25.434
I've never missed a plane, I haven't missed anything.

39:30.409 --> 39:34.527
And you are not responsible for Me. I am responsible for Myself.

39:34.728 --> 39:39.384
Nor, also for Sahaja Yoga you are not responsible in a way.

39:42.179 --> 39:46.641
But here, in the West, they make a time bound. Too much of it.

39:48.065 --> 39:52.525
But in India is bad manners to see watch in the presence of a saint.

39:52.726 --> 39:54.158
It's bad manners.

39:54.349 --> 39:57.269
It's sinful actually to see a watch.

39:57.470 --> 39:59.238
When you have left everything to the saint,

39:59.439 --> 40:01.380
why should you see the watch?

40:01.581 --> 40:03.881
And normally also Indians won't see a watch

40:04.082 --> 40:08.420
if they are talking to someone or... is regarded as bad manners.

40:08.621 --> 40:12.458
Indian bad manners if you see, you will be shocked.

40:14.131 --> 40:18.119
Dhara is her husband, isn't it?  You married Mr. Dhara, isn't it?

40:18.320 --> 40:19.716
Who is a lawyer.
SY: Yes.

40:19.917 --> 40:22.592
SM: Atul.
SY: Atul, yes.

40:30.042 --> 40:32.466
SM: All right.

40:33.923 --> 40:35.944
Bhoot.

40:38.912 --> 40:41.748
This watch must be a bhoot.

40:41.949 --> 40:43.638
SY: We should shoebeat it, Shri Mataji.

40:43.839 --> 40:47.116
SM: Really shoebeat it. Give it a bhandan.

40:50.468 --> 40:53.925
Attention is, attention is the one.

40:54.158 --> 40:55.636
But if you have a proper attention

40:55.837 --> 40:59.431
immediately you know what you have to do, at what time.

41:01.195 --> 41:03.660
Like it was at 10.30.

41:03.861 --> 41:05.292
But they unnecessarily hurried

41:05.493 --> 41:08.950
