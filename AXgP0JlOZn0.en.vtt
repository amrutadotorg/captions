00:02:45.955 --> 00:02:48.160
BM: Gravity is also one type of energy, isn't it, Shri Mataji?

00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:50.959
SM: Of course, in the Feet.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.999
SY: In the Feet.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.859
BM: Because it is one of the things which balances us,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.500
called migraine (n.t. probably Baba Mama meant magnetism).

00:02:58.771 --> 00:03:02.471
Migraine (n.t. magnetism), migraine is one thing which balances us.

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:05.639
Is there any relation between head and the feet?

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.999
SM: The whole feet are in the head. (n.t. connected to the head probably).

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.940
BM: The feet are in the head?

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.520
SM: Or head is in the feet. BM: I also thought the same.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.660
Head in the feet or feet in the head, because...

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.986
SM: When you rub My soles, vibrations come of your head.

00:03:19.187 --> 00:03:20.619
BM: Yes.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.354
SM: [unclear]

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.604
BM: Yes, because when we rub Your Feet, we get a very good sleep.

00:03:36.805 --> 00:03:39.180
SM: Now, if we start from here...

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.460
BM: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.179
SM: If you start... Now see, if you fold the sari

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.888
like this, you see,

00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:52.100
the break is a forth, you see.

00:03:52.296 --> 00:03:55.679
So when it opens out, you see, these chakras.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.310
open up like this, see.

00:03:59.774 --> 00:04:03.485
So, this one at the back

00:04:03.686 --> 00:04:06.700
are the chakras and these are the incarnations,

00:04:06.918 --> 00:04:08.887
So in the center comes the heart.

00:04:09.088 --> 00:04:10.088
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:04:10.303 --> 00:04:13.834
Here is Mooladhara and here's Agnya.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.087
Then is Swadhishtana.

00:04:17.288 --> 00:04:21.639
Now, this Swadhishthana is moving like that.

00:04:22.917 --> 00:04:26.733
Right? And then comes the Nabhi.

00:04:27.157 --> 00:04:28.157
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:04:28.358 --> 00:04:29.941
So these are the incarnations here.

00:04:30.142 --> 00:04:33.579
Now the Nabhi incarnation is Virata, is here.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.565
SY: They all go up till the pitha - I know.

00:04:35.766 --> 00:04:37.960
SM: I mean, like this they open out.

00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:40.637
So Mooladhara becomes Christ.

00:04:40.838 --> 00:04:44.179
Then, you get this Swadhishthana.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.798
Swadhishtana we have got the incarnations like Ali,

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.262
SY: Yes.
SM: He's one of them.

00:04:52.816 --> 00:04:56.172
Or you can say all these “Nath Panthis” and all.

00:04:56.377 --> 00:05:00.335
Then comes the... third chakra is Nabhi.

00:05:00.536 --> 00:05:02.706
Nabhi is Lakshmi Narayana.

00:05:02.907 --> 00:05:06.355
So they are expressed here, as Virat.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.570
Now ultimately you come to Heart. Heart is here.

00:05:09.771 --> 00:05:11.600
SY: O.k. Jai Shri Mataji.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.820
Now, I see!

00:05:14.017 --> 00:05:16.332
SM: So there is only one for heart.

00:05:16.533 --> 00:05:20.198
Because at that point they meet.
BM: Yes.

00:05:26.556 --> 00:05:29.390
When you get diabetes,

00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:32.691
what happens is, of course Swadhishtana is here also.

00:05:32.902 --> 00:05:35.665
This is the “Nath Panthi”, right?

00:05:35.856 --> 00:05:38.908
But here at the back what happens, when you get diabetes,

00:05:39.109 --> 00:05:41.400
your Swadhishtana [is there].

00:05:41.601 --> 00:05:45.613
And the Swadhishtana is surrounding the Mooladhara in the brain -

00:05:45.814 --> 00:05:48.716
on top, so it presses.

00:05:48.917 --> 00:05:53.816
And that’s how you get problems with the eyes in diabetes.

00:06:00.003 --> 00:06:02.677
So if you put ice -

00:06:02.878 --> 00:06:06.128
if your liver is bad also, you get problems of eyes.

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:10.905
So you put ice on that, on the back side, your eyes can be cured.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.459
For diabetes, simply put ice on the liver

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:15.904
and ice here (on the back Agnya).

00:06:16.105 --> 00:06:21.967
But also there is a little touch of left in diseases like that.

00:06:22.168 --> 00:06:26.244
Because, after all diabetes is caused by the left organs.

00:06:27.544 --> 00:06:31.364
So you have to use lemons also.

00:06:32.846 --> 00:06:36.820
You know, [after use], throw them away.

00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:39.786
For diseases like that. For liver you don’t have to -

00:06:39.987 --> 00:06:41.624
liver is on the right side.

00:06:41.825 --> 00:06:46.140
For right side organs you don’t have to use.

00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:49.517
But even I have seen, if you get asthma,

00:06:49.718 --> 00:06:51.718
that is also the right side,

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:54.520
but little bit triggered by the left.

00:06:54.721 --> 00:06:56.056
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:06:56.257 --> 00:06:58.390
SM: So no use using lemon all the time,

00:06:58.591 --> 00:07:01.005
I mean whatever disease may be, right or left.

00:07:01.206 --> 00:07:05.325
But in some places is just left - mental cases.

00:07:05.526 --> 00:07:09.623
Then you have to only work on lemons, left side, light.

00:07:09.824 --> 00:07:15.455
When it is right side, then you have to use only water.

00:07:15.656 --> 00:07:18.517
When it is left side you have to use the light.

00:07:18.718 --> 00:07:21.513
SY: When it's left side, we have to use the light

00:07:21.714 --> 00:07:25.390
And the right side, you have to use the water.

00:07:25.893 --> 00:07:27.171
So it's only the left hand,

00:07:27.372 --> 00:07:30.120
left sided people get right side diseases

00:07:30.321 --> 00:07:32.458
and the right sided people get left diseases?

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:34.645
Is that the manifestation Shri Mataji?

00:07:34.846 --> 00:07:36.276
SM: No.
SY: Not necessarily!

00:07:36.477 --> 00:07:39.344
SM: You see, right sided people get first of all the liver.

00:07:39.545 --> 00:07:40.545
SY: Yes.

00:07:40.776 --> 00:07:46.046
SM: As a result, the liver has to excrete its heat into the

00:07:48.095 --> 00:07:49.739
blood stream.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.770
But it does not.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:56.815
So what happens that that heat passes upwards or downwards.

00:07:58.132 --> 00:08:02.238
So, when it goes upwards, it causes asthma to the lungs.

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:05.134
When it goes downwards

00:08:05.335 --> 00:08:08.072
also the coagulation of the kidneys take place.

00:08:08.273 --> 00:08:11.282
So problems of kidneys start - you cannot pass urine.

00:08:11.483 --> 00:08:14.998
If it is goes further also you get constipation.

00:08:15.649 --> 00:08:20.032
But if it passes on the sides, then you get a massive heart attack.

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:23.824
Supposing a person is drinking very early in age

00:08:24.025 --> 00:08:26.177
and also playing very hard games,

00:08:26.378 --> 00:08:29.503
he will die at a very young age.

00:08:31.231 --> 00:08:34.807
Now, the left sided problems are more mental.

00:08:35.008 --> 00:08:39.192
They are depressant, they are sulky.

00:08:39.393 --> 00:08:41.666
SY: They are emotional.
SM: They are unhappy, they are crying.

00:08:41.867 --> 00:08:45.356
No, even the people who are right sided can cry.

00:08:45.696 --> 00:08:48.811
Because they think they are very miserable, but they are not.

00:08:49.012 --> 00:08:50.918
They make everybody miserable.

00:08:51.119 --> 00:08:53.566
Right sided people make others miserable

00:08:53.767 --> 00:08:57.237
and the left sided people suffer themselves.

00:08:57.777 --> 00:09:00.088
SY: All Christians must be left-sided, Shri Mataji.

00:09:00.289 --> 00:09:02.215
All Christians should be left sided then.

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:04.297
SM: They try to, but they are not.

00:09:04.498 --> 00:09:07.897
Where have you seen them to be kind?

00:09:08.754 --> 00:09:12.176
In any country they went with the gun in their hands

00:09:12.377 --> 00:09:14.819
and Bible in the other hand.
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.608
SM: These Christians have killed thousands!

00:09:20.783 --> 00:09:24.336
They are not Christians at all. Not at all.

00:09:25.215 --> 00:09:29.808
So this is how. Then the psychosomatic comes when both combine.

00:09:30.009 --> 00:09:33.894
Like cancer, can be a person, can get it when... SY: Left and right.

00:09:34.095 --> 00:09:37.880
SM: ...he uses right side too much, but triggered by left.

00:09:38.081 --> 00:09:40.140
So, first always try left for such people,

00:09:40.341 --> 00:09:42.433
incurable, any incurable diseases.

00:09:42.634 --> 00:09:45.655
Try first left, then the right.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.612
SY: I see.

00:09:49.712 --> 00:09:52.174
It means he must start with the light.

00:09:52.375 --> 00:09:54.525
SM: I mean, not in everyone if they are right-sided,

00:09:54.726 --> 00:09:57.384
but you see, you can see on the...
SY: On the vibrations.

00:09:57.585 --> 00:10:00.680
Now supposing you have hot vibrations on the left

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:02.248
then start on that.

00:10:02.449 --> 00:10:04.594
Hot vibrations on right - then start on that.

00:10:04.795 --> 00:10:08.561
Immediately you will know which one to start first.
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:10:09.153 --> 00:10:11.008
And you should all get into it.

00:10:11.215 --> 00:10:13.943
You see we have got now [Gayakwar].

00:10:14.144 --> 00:10:16.301
SY: Yes Shri Mataji.
SM: So good.

00:10:16.502 --> 00:10:17.975
SY: He is really...

00:10:18.176 --> 00:10:22.364
He describes the house

00:10:22.565 --> 00:10:24.169
of a person whom he has never visited

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.000
because on vibrations, he can feel that.

00:10:26.232 --> 00:10:27.931
He's gone, he's gone so deep.

00:10:28.132 --> 00:10:32.832
He can describe the house of a person, whom he has not visited.

00:10:33.388 --> 00:10:36.258
SM: Yes. He goes to the right, Baba, that's the problem with him.

00:10:36.459 --> 00:10:38.290
He shouldn’t do all these things.

00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:40.658
There's no need. Why to describe somebody's house?

00:10:40.859 --> 00:10:42.282
I mean it's senseless. SY: Yes.

00:10:42.483 --> 00:10:45.070
In Sahaja Yoga you should do whatever is necessary.

00:10:45.271 --> 00:10:49.418
Whatever is not necessary why to do it? Describe somebody’s house!

00:10:49.619 --> 00:10:52.172
What is the need? SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:10:52.373 --> 00:10:55.867
He goes right sided. I've told him to stop all these things.

00:10:56.068 --> 00:10:58.993
Only just feel the vibrations. That’s all.

00:10:59.194 --> 00:11:02.120
Otherwise he'll lose powers.

00:11:02.751 --> 00:11:05.257
You better tell him once he shouldn't do all these things.

00:11:05.458 --> 00:11:08.151
I've told him already.
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:11:08.352 --> 00:11:12.656
We had one fellow like that and he went so much to the right

00:11:12.857 --> 00:11:16.824
and unfortunately he met one Scientologist lady.

00:11:17.025 --> 00:11:21.325
And then he just vomited blood, vomited blood and died.

00:11:22.728 --> 00:11:26.345
SY: It is again an imbalance Shri Mataji - misusing the power.

00:11:26.546 --> 00:11:30.011
SM: No, no, you go to the right - sees futures!

00:11:30.392 --> 00:11:32.811
So why? You just see this.

00:11:33.012 --> 00:11:35.359
What is the need to see this... somebody’s house?

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.728
One should try to understand - what is the need

00:11:41.076 --> 00:11:44.187
to do unnecessary things?

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.075
How many unnecessary things we do?

00:11:47.276 --> 00:11:50.595
I mean, we are like monkeys, I tell you, in a way.

00:11:51.667 --> 00:11:53.988
SY: That You were saying Shri Mataji once, that

00:11:54.197 --> 00:11:58.168
our, our ancestors have left a permanent imprint on us.

00:11:58.369 --> 00:12:00.975
I remember You have said.
SM: I mean unnecessarily as monkeys

00:12:01.176 --> 00:12:02.714
will go on doing things and all.

00:12:02.915 --> 00:12:04.622
We too [unclear]. We are copycats like them.

00:12:04.823 --> 00:12:06.757
Absolutely we are copycats.

00:12:06.958 --> 00:12:10.063
Once a monkey came into our room.

00:12:10.264 --> 00:12:13.035
We are staying in somebody’s house, upstairs.

00:12:13.236 --> 00:12:15.639
And it took a pair of C.P. ’s - one shoe.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.306
And C.P. got quite worried,

00:12:17.505 --> 00:12:20.007
"Now what to do?" It has taken [unclear] - one shoe.

00:12:20.208 --> 00:12:22.938
This is very easy. I took another shoe and put it on the ground.

00:12:23.139 --> 00:12:25.982
He also put it on the ground.

00:12:26.549 --> 00:12:29.026
Brainless creatures.

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:33.482
And that’s how we follow fashions, because we are brainless.

00:12:33.683 --> 00:12:36.466
Monkey brands.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.710
But Hanumana had wisdom.

00:12:43.745 --> 00:12:48.297
Hanumana was a monkey which shot up because of His wisdom.

00:12:48.506 --> 00:12:53.379
We are still monkeys and fools! [Folly] pets I think!

00:12:55.462 --> 00:13:00.162
Why to do unnecessary things? Just, it’s not necessary.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.562
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji

00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:06.709
SM: That’s all - very simple.

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:12.632
SY: And wisdom will tell you as to what is necessary

00:13:12.833 --> 00:13:15.004
and what is not necessary.
SM: Of course, vibrations are there.

00:13:15.205 --> 00:13:18.302
SY: Vibrations will tell you, Shri Mataji.

00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:31.847
SM: That at least, minimum you have is wisdom.

00:13:32.347 --> 00:13:34.785
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:13:34.986 --> 00:13:37.785
If you people don't even get your wisdom,

00:13:37.986 --> 00:13:41.170
what’s the use of coming to Sahaja yoga? If you are still a donkey

00:13:41.371 --> 00:13:44.154
it’s better not to come to Sahaja Yoga - this is the point, you see.

00:13:44.355 --> 00:13:46.484
At least ask for wisdom.

00:13:46.685 --> 00:13:48.595
[But that's not so] - what they do,

00:13:48.796 --> 00:13:50.857
as soon as they come they want assert themselves,

00:13:51.058 --> 00:13:52.381
"I am something", you know.

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:56.007
SM: I say: "Big pot".
SY: I say: "Big pot he is".

00:13:56.208 --> 00:13:59.363
SY: Shri Mataji, would it be proper to conclude that, for that,

00:13:59.564 --> 00:14:03.653
the culmination of pure knowledge is wisdom, in Sahaja Yoga?

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.140
SM: What is the?

00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.260
SY: The culmination of pure knowledge is wisdom, Shri Mataji?

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:13.020
SM: No, wisdom is the symptom of it.

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:16.910
SY: It’s a symptom of that. Oh, I see! It’s reverse.

00:14:17.111 --> 00:14:19.449
SM: Effect.

00:14:26.393 --> 00:14:28.153
But also you have the wisdom to see

00:14:28.354 --> 00:14:30.585
what is necessary, what is not necessary.

00:14:30.786 --> 00:14:33.116
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.
SM: You just do what is necessary.

00:14:33.317 --> 00:14:36.597
SY: Because, even if it feels , as they say knowledge has come,

00:14:36.798 --> 00:14:38.983
they say the wisdom is lingering.

00:14:39.184 --> 00:14:43.150
Because if you are not wise and your knowledgeable

00:14:43.351 --> 00:14:46.071
that is useless.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.651
SM: So that’s what I say is yoga without knowledge is useless

00:14:51.852 --> 00:14:54.859
and knowledge without yoga is useless.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:57.318
SY: I see.

00:15:01.598 --> 00:15:04.091
Wisdom is something which is within ourselves, you see,

00:15:04.292 --> 00:15:06.580
only it’s like an ocean,

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:09.233
only thing you have to get into it.

00:15:09.434 --> 00:15:11.844
It’s a symptom of that knowledge,

00:15:12.045 --> 00:15:15.898
or you can say is the projection or the light.

00:15:17.402 --> 00:15:20.220
But you are not worldly wise,

00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:23.197
you don't, you are not meticulous,

00:15:23.398 --> 00:15:27.962
but you are in that ocean so the ocean looks after.

00:15:28.163 --> 00:15:31.972
The ocean has the wisdom, no doubt of it.

00:15:32.353 --> 00:15:35.850
And you accept it, you see, that "All right,

00:15:36.051 --> 00:15:38.996
this was to be, all right, doesn’t matter."

00:15:39.455 --> 00:15:41.938
Let it go on!

00:15:43.261 --> 00:15:44.871
Don’t get frustrated with it.

00:15:45.072 --> 00:15:47.222
Just say, "All right, this was the part of the game".

00:15:47.423 --> 00:15:51.403
Like we have lots of [funny], horrible things in this Australia.

00:15:51.604 --> 00:15:55.124
One after another they are cleared out.

00:15:56.689 --> 00:16:01.255
Some were really unwise people, extremely unwise.

00:16:01.512 --> 00:16:03.985
So they went away.

00:16:15.388 --> 00:16:17.214
SY: I think you would required wisdom

00:16:17.415 --> 00:16:20.124
even to understand what vibrations are saying, Shri Mataji.

00:16:20.325 --> 00:16:22.499
SM: Np, you have to have just vibrations, Baba, that's

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.709
so innately built within you.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:28.228
We don’t need any wisdom to see things through our eyes.

00:16:28.429 --> 00:16:31.117
It’s your awareness now.

00:16:32.745 --> 00:16:35.111
SY: But we... Don’t we have to go to mental level to...?

00:16:35.312 --> 00:16:36.803
SM: No, no, not at all.
SY: Not at all.

00:16:37.004 --> 00:16:39.572
SM: No need. You know already what it is now.

00:16:39.773 --> 00:16:42.020
Immediately you will know what’s wrong with this person,

00:16:42.228 --> 00:16:46.370
what’s wrong with that person, what’s wrong with you.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.057
But the problem in the West is this thing, you see. Two...

00:16:51.438 --> 00:16:53.797
Double type - in India and different here.

00:16:53.998 --> 00:16:57.583
Here they say, “Yes I have ego. All right, so what?"

00:16:58.298 --> 00:16:59.580
As simple.

00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:01.740
In India, they'll say, “No, I don’t have ego”!

00:17:01.941 --> 00:17:04.769
I mean, both ways it’s just the same.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.723
Here they just come out: "Yes, I have terrible ego Mother.

00:17:07.924 --> 00:17:09.947
I know, I have terrible ego."

00:17:10.148 --> 00:17:13.611
Then you start looking, "[Wrong but] true!"

00:17:15.448 --> 00:17:17.673
They'll just confess.

00:17:17.874 --> 00:17:19.489
SY: It's ego's idea, of course.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:22.035
SM: Yes, I know... Yes, of course, ego is quite intact.

00:17:22.236 --> 00:17:24.317
But, you see, they say it.

00:17:24.518 --> 00:17:26.738
In India they would never say such a thing, you know?

00:17:26.939 --> 00:17:30.536
They would never say such a thing - never. They'll never accept.

00:17:30.737 --> 00:17:34.416
They never feel guilty, can you imagine these Indians?

00:17:34.626 --> 00:17:37.518
We have quite shameless people there (in India).

00:17:42.148 --> 00:17:45.434
I got a letter about Patrice - many - and I asked him,

00:17:45.635 --> 00:17:46.798
from Finland.

00:17:46.999 --> 00:17:49.922
I said, “Patrice, there is so much complaints about you”.

00:17:50.123 --> 00:17:55.050
“Yes Mother, I have a terrible ego. I know that - terrible”.

00:17:57.834 --> 00:18:01.667
I didn’t know what to say to him after that.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.373
Here, people will shamelessly tell you.

00:18:07.154 --> 00:18:09.760
In India people are shameless and they will never accept.

00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:13.540
And here people will tell you shamelessly.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.127
SY: Because it’s considered to be social taboo, Shri Mataji,

00:18:18.328 --> 00:18:20.657
to be egoistic in India, I think.

00:18:20.858 --> 00:18:23.740
I mean, a bad we'll be said the “garvishtha”.

00:18:23.941 --> 00:18:26.223
Is that something we say? Garvishtha, garvishtha.

00:18:26.424 --> 00:18:28.801
SM: I know that in our place, you see,

00:18:29.002 --> 00:18:33.082
is such a, so many stuff good manners and social taboos.

00:18:33.514 --> 00:18:36.376
I mean, we'll never say to somebody “I hate you”, can we?

00:18:36.586 --> 00:18:39.721
Does anyone say in Marathi "I hate you"? BM: If someone says "I hate you" then that's it.

00:18:39.922 --> 00:18:41.151
SM: I mean, imagine.

00:18:41.352 --> 00:18:45.185
I would regard him as a mad man or something - is absolutely stupid.

00:18:45.386 --> 00:18:47.704
SY: So it will be so uncultured the statement...

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.757
This will be considered, it will be considered a very uncultured statement.

00:18:50.958 --> 00:18:52.715
SM: SM: Uncool. But they are never going to say that ever.

00:18:52.916 --> 00:18:55.500
SY: Yes, we will not say also, because, because of the taboo...

00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:57.587
SM: The social taboo.
SY: The social taboo.

00:18:57.788 --> 00:19:00.194
SM:(Bhayankar= excessive) good manners are ingrained in Indians.

00:19:00.395 --> 00:19:02.912
But here invariably they say "I hate you",

00:19:03.113 --> 00:19:05.555
"I hate you, I hate this, I hate that" -

00:19:05.756 --> 00:19:08.250
all the time.

00:19:08.779 --> 00:19:10.982
SY: Yeah, there is, there are only two stages,

00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:15.684
either you hate somebody or you like somebody.

00:19:22.825 --> 00:19:25.489
SM:  How can they use the word "hate" so easily?

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:28.340
In our place, imagine, if somebody says like that, the father will beat him.

00:19:28.541 --> 00:19:30.552
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:19:31.628 --> 00:19:33.580
SM: Here, they will say "darling" to anyone,

00:19:33.781 --> 00:19:36.563
they will say "I love you" to anyone.

00:19:38.224 --> 00:19:40.743
In India they will do it secretly, openly they will never do it.

00:19:40.934 --> 00:19:42.036
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji

00:19:42.237 --> 00:19:45.945
SY: And again it has a bearing...
SM: Yes, on the social taboos.

00:19:46.146 --> 00:19:48.537
Whether they'll hate you like a snake,

00:19:48.744 --> 00:19:51.370
they'll never openly say so.

00:19:52.996 --> 00:19:57.260
That’s India. That’s another extreme.This is another extreme.

00:20:01.199 --> 00:20:03.856
But if you have ego why not correct it?

00:20:04.057 --> 00:20:07.682
Thank God you know you have ego, so why not correct it?

00:20:09.492 --> 00:20:12.173
SY: Here Mother, if, it's almost to the point,

00:20:12.374 --> 00:20:14.876
if you hate somebody you put in advertisement in the newspaper

00:20:15.077 --> 00:20:16.838
so everybody knows it.

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:18.259
SM: Is it so?

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.652
SY: It's not quite, but...
SY: Yes.

00:20:20.853 --> 00:20:23.269
SM: I mean nobody will say.
SY: [Then amounting to]!

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:27.671
SM: But if you hate someone, supposing, I'm taking another view,

00:20:27.872 --> 00:20:31.251
central view - now, supposing you hate someone...

00:20:31.452 --> 00:20:34.201
So what? Who are you? What’s your authority?

00:20:34.402 --> 00:20:35.894
SY: That's right.

00:20:36.095 --> 00:20:37.505
You hate, so hate, go ahead…

00:20:37.706 --> 00:20:40.875
SY: And that again, it’s a product of ego Shri Mataji! Hating...

00:20:41.076 --> 00:20:42.506
SM: I hate you.
SY: I hate!

00:20:42.707 --> 00:20:44.640
I hate - so it’s a product of ego.

00:20:44.841 --> 00:20:47.015
SM: Who are you? I mean, you hate.

00:20:47.216 --> 00:20:50.239
O.k., what does it matter? I mean, who are you?

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.874
Authority - what is your authority saying "I hate you"?

00:20:54.075 --> 00:20:56.784
SY: So the reply, should be: "Go and jump in the sea".

00:20:56.985 --> 00:21:00.475
SM: Or, should be that, "As you do, I do".

00:21:03.382 --> 00:21:07.263
But that won’t be wise. Just to say that "All right, I had enough".

00:21:07.464 --> 00:21:09.962
SY: But in Marathi, how do we say, Shri Mataji? "Same to you".

00:21:10.163 --> 00:21:13.310
SM: Same to you!

00:21:17.163 --> 00:21:22.243
Marathi language is only humor, humor, humor.

00:21:22.553 --> 00:21:25.299
SY: It's the same with this forgiveness thing, isn't it Shri Mataji?

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.641
I mean, who are, who are we not to forgive?

00:21:27.842 --> 00:21:29.953
What are we doing when we don't forgive?

00:21:30.154 --> 00:21:32.494
It's the same what are we doing when we hate. I mean,

00:21:32.695 --> 00:21:33.698
it's all here.

00:21:33.899 --> 00:21:36.799
SM: I mean there's nothing that you do: hate only. But...

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.974
you see, at least when you say I don't forgive,

00:21:39.175 --> 00:21:41.919
you have a right about yourself: that you forgive or don't forgive.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.633
But if you hate, what right have you got to hate anyone?

00:21:44.834 --> 00:21:48.428
And even if you hate, who, who cares for you are hating?

00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:51.462
You are not God, that you hate me and it means

00:21:51.663 --> 00:21:53.907
it has a meaning or has any purpose

00:21:54.108 --> 00:21:55.743
or has an effect.

00:21:55.944 --> 00:21:59.831
And the Christians, pardon me, Shri Mataji, are forbidden,

00:22:00.032 --> 00:22:02.655
both for, for forgiving or for hating,

00:22:02.856 --> 00:22:07.387
because both these places they acquire the status of judgment.

00:22:07.888 --> 00:22:10.063
In both the cases, they are judging.

00:22:10.264 --> 00:22:12.409
And there is prohibition for judgment in..

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:13.997
SM: But forgiving, yes...

00:22:14.198 --> 00:22:16.889
SY: Even forgiving you are judging, Shri Mataji.

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:20.370
You are judging that: "I, I have judged you

00:22:20.571 --> 00:22:22.865
and I have forgiven you".

00:22:23.638 --> 00:22:26.575
SM: It's all just in the head!

00:22:26.776 --> 00:22:29.835
Keeping in the head, all right.

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.281
So they are so anti-Christian qualities.

00:22:32.482 --> 00:22:34.853
SM: Oh, this you pour here. That way.

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:38.770
It’s all anti-Christian, Baba.

00:22:38.971 --> 00:22:41.244
It's all anti-Hindu, anti-Christian, anti-Muslim.

00:22:41.445 --> 00:22:45.459
SY: It's anti-God, Shri Mataji.
SM: It's all anti-God.

00:22:46.524 --> 00:22:50.147
We should relate to One - the Absolute -

00:22:50.607 --> 00:22:52.500
otherwise is all absurd.

00:22:52.701 --> 00:22:55.787
What is the criteria

00:22:55.988 --> 00:22:59.842
for this kind of different, different types of things

00:23:00.043 --> 00:23:02.384
that people have?

00:23:02.585 --> 00:23:04.326
Means division undivided.

00:23:04.527 --> 00:23:07.830
There should be no difference.

00:23:09.193 --> 00:23:10.917
SY: Because God has made no difference

00:23:11.118 --> 00:23:13.933
between human being and human being, Shri Mataji.

00:23:14.134 --> 00:23:16.635
SM: He has just varieties, that's all.

00:23:16.836 --> 00:23:19.878
Variety is important, otherwise we will be bored stiff, you see?

00:23:20.079 --> 00:23:22.496
To see all of us that's the same, imagine?

00:23:22.697 --> 00:23:25.115
How it would look?

00:23:27.256 --> 00:23:30.525
SY: Shri Mataji, even the animals would be having this variety.

00:23:30.726 --> 00:23:33.695
I mean, supposing there is tiger and there is another tiger.

00:23:33.896 --> 00:23:35.661
SM: Yes, but they are under control of God.

00:23:35.844 --> 00:23:37.064
They are "pashu", aren't they?

00:23:37.265 --> 00:23:39.235
in the "Paash" (leash) - control of God.

00:23:39.436 --> 00:23:41.692
They don’t have problem of sin at all.

00:23:41.893 --> 00:23:44.738
A tiger can go and kill any cow, eat it nicely,

00:23:44.939 --> 00:23:47.033
leave it for others to eat.

00:23:47.234 --> 00:23:50.066
He doesn’t think he has committed any sin.

00:23:50.267 --> 00:23:52.126
It's only the human being in their freedom

00:23:52.327 --> 00:23:55.369
think they are committing sins.

00:24:03.485 --> 00:24:06.300
So for human beings,

00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:08.354
the second stage,

00:24:08.555 --> 00:24:11.438
first the stage of animals is

00:24:11.639 --> 00:24:15.830
to be completely under the control of Divine.

00:24:16.837 --> 00:24:19.334
And then the second stage is:

00:24:19.535 --> 00:24:22.338
human beings where they have freedom to choose.

00:24:22.539 --> 00:24:28.832
And then, in their own freedom, they should control

00:24:30.306 --> 00:24:32.172
their divinity, which they have got it.

00:24:32.373 --> 00:24:35.707
Control means they should be under the divinity that they have got,

00:24:35.908 --> 00:24:37.748
the light that they have got.

00:24:37.949 --> 00:24:41.620
But here they are aware. Animals are not aware.

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:46.346
In our awareness we have to

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.838
know that we are free

00:24:51.675 --> 00:24:54.486
and surrendered.

00:24:54.904 --> 00:24:57.915
This is the difference is. So in three stages we [move],

00:24:58.116 --> 00:25:02.183
from animal, human and then to superhuman.

00:25:16.118 --> 00:25:19.799
Any confession in the West, Baba, is so horrifying.

00:25:20.016 --> 00:25:23.129
You can’t read them, really.

00:25:23.361 --> 00:25:26.382
I used to get piles and piles of letters and would burn them.

00:25:26.583 --> 00:25:28.646
Confessions are the worst thing.

00:25:28.847 --> 00:25:32.035
It's coming from Catholic church I think.

00:25:32.977 --> 00:25:37.955
"Confessing my past life". Who is interested in your past life?

00:25:38.156 --> 00:25:40.412
Piles and piles of letters.

00:25:40.613 --> 00:25:42.177
"Mother I did this, I did"...

00:25:42.378 --> 00:25:46.784
I mean I just don’t want to know about it - finished.

00:25:48.855 --> 00:25:51.701
I am here for cleansing.

00:25:55.912 --> 00:25:59.832
Right, right hand, put your left like this.

00:26:00.038 --> 00:26:02.820
Put right straight.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.597
After some time it shakes.

00:26:15.041 --> 00:26:17.736
And they say, "I have 'bhoots'".

00:26:17.937 --> 00:26:20.455
They will also say that, “Mother I have got a bhoot in me" –

00:26:20.656 --> 00:26:23.137
there's no harm".

00:26:25.865 --> 00:26:29.580
"I am negative” - that’s all. Then what do you do?

00:26:29.781 --> 00:26:33.016
I mean it's a confession of a thief, you know.

00:26:34.142 --> 00:26:38.683
It’s very difficult for Me to deal with them, then.

00:26:38.925 --> 00:26:41.053
So they have confessed, so what?

00:26:41.254 --> 00:26:44.446
It’s a Christian idea: that as long as you confess it to a priest,

00:26:44.647 --> 00:26:46.653
you are out of it.
SY: Yes, your sins is lost.

00:26:46.854 --> 00:26:51.161
SY: Because their idea is that Christ had come to wash your sins.

00:26:51.362 --> 00:26:55.669
And if you come clean, then He will be doing, doing the...

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.958
He will be laundering your sins, you see.

00:26:58.159 --> 00:27:01.287
SM: Same with Me, but there is no need to confess.

00:27:01.488 --> 00:27:02.704
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:27:02.905 --> 00:27:04.120
SM: Not necessary.

00:27:04.321 --> 00:27:06.280
I know already whatever is there.

00:27:06.481 --> 00:27:09.920
But by confession, you say: "I have now confessed it". So what?

00:27:10.121 --> 00:27:11.682
SY: "So I am free.

00:27:11.873 --> 00:27:15.412
I have got a clean [slate] for another set of sins."

00:27:17.757 --> 00:27:21.740
SY: "Yes, I have to make room for the next lots".

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:25.992
SM: You have to go to the end of Feet.

00:27:32.843 --> 00:27:35.416
All right. May God bless you.

00:27:37.565 --> 00:27:39.686
Now, don’t feel guilty.

00:27:39.887 --> 00:27:43.073
Little bit probably, but don't feel guilty.

00:27:45.504 --> 00:27:46.737
Let's go. It's done.

00:27:46.938 --> 00:27:49.207
I will get ready. We have to go now.

00:27:49.408 --> 00:27:51.215
Still little time.

00:27:53.472 --> 00:27:57.712
But otherwise, you see, it’s working out very well, I must say.

00:27:57.963 --> 00:27:59.185
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:27:59.386 --> 00:28:02.169
I never expected, Baba, in My life time to see all this,

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:04.552
really, to be very frank.

00:28:05.254 --> 00:28:08.043
So I'm very happy.

00:28:08.244 --> 00:28:12.507
And the more you open out the vision, the more you will see

00:28:14.365 --> 00:28:17.049
and more see the peripheries also.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:20.017
It's very encouraging,

00:28:21.775 --> 00:28:26.049
that so many can see so clearly and know,

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:28.732
and I can talk to them.

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:34.377
Imagine Christ talking to these people there,

00:28:34.568 --> 00:28:36.735
to the multitudes.

00:28:37.249 --> 00:28:41.283
I used to say mule-titudes. Mules -

00:28:42.318 --> 00:28:44.142
talk to the mules.

00:28:44.343 --> 00:28:47.507
And they crucified Him, very nicely.

00:28:48.326 --> 00:28:51.369
I mean, just think of that.

00:29:10.763 --> 00:29:13.083
Later, when they accept this article,

00:29:13.284 --> 00:29:15.789
we will write about them, about Andha Shraddha (blind faith).

00:29:15.996 --> 00:29:17.813
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:29:19.473 --> 00:29:22.798
SM: I will definitely write an article before leaving.

00:29:33.682 --> 00:29:37.622
I think there is already an article written about.

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:42.217
SY: They started their activity, Shri Mataji,

00:29:42.418 --> 00:29:46.282
because of the gullible rural people.

00:29:46.483 --> 00:29:49.094
And they, they also did not want to

00:29:49.295 --> 00:29:52.157
bring into their folds the real gurus.

00:29:52.358 --> 00:29:54.532
But now they have become so successful

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.841
and the succes is given, I mean triggered out their ego.

00:29:58.042 --> 00:30:00.490
So now they are taking everywhere.
SM: No, no, not everywhere. Not everywhere.

00:30:00.691 --> 00:30:05.293
Recently, there was an article in this "Police Times" (Marathi newspaper).

00:30:06.809 --> 00:30:12.844
that Andha Shraddha Nirmulan has been blasted.

00:30:13.045 --> 00:30:14.320
And she wrote that.

00:30:14.521 --> 00:30:19.850
There was a lady who was taking out these: kumkum and this and that.

00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:22.469
And they said, "We'll give you 2 lakhs if you show us".

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:25.769
And she showed them. They never gave her 2 lakhs.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:27.661
So it was all reported.

00:30:27.862 --> 00:30:30.396
Then [Methani] answered that very beautifully,

00:30:30.607 --> 00:30:32.391
that, "All these things are done, no doubt.

00:30:32.592 --> 00:30:34.518
I also went to a guru like that and I suffered a lot

00:30:34.719 --> 00:30:35.948
and all those things, but,

00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:38.200
these things are not good, they should not be followed.

00:30:38.401 --> 00:30:40.563
What you you have to follow is Sahaja Yoga" - like that.

00:30:40.764 --> 00:30:43.194
Very good article came.

00:30:43.395 --> 00:30:48.162
So, you see, they have been successful in some cases -

00:30:48.363 --> 00:30:53.828
where it has been really something wrong, they could find out -

00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:56.074
very few cases like this.

00:30:56.275 --> 00:30:59.035
But they went up to a hill where there was a lady

00:30:59.236 --> 00:31:02.940
who was supposed to be curing or something whatever it is,

00:31:03.141 --> 00:31:05.715
and they burnt her hut - they [breed/buried] all this,

00:31:05.882 --> 00:31:07.544
they are very violent people.

00:31:07.745 --> 00:31:11.671
If they don’t find anything they just go amok.

00:31:13.655 --> 00:31:15.582
SY: Yes.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:20.532
SM: Now, the Christian missionaries,

00:31:20.733 --> 00:31:22.779
they have been successful because

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:27.955
nobody is allowed to propagate religion, like this, in India.

00:31:28.156 --> 00:31:29.371
So they were successful.

00:31:29.572 --> 00:31:31.484
SY: Yes.

00:31:32.933 --> 00:31:35.280
SY: They were showing a television, on Babhulkar,

00:31:35.481 --> 00:31:37.350
they were showing him on television.

00:31:37.551 --> 00:31:39.663
SM: Yes because, because of Sharad Pawar.

00:31:39.864 --> 00:31:44.985
SY: Yes. He had shown in some instances, where you know, in...

00:31:46.123 --> 00:31:48.741
South of Maharashtra there is a village

00:31:48.942 --> 00:31:52.185
and they believe - all of them in the village believe that

00:31:52.386 --> 00:31:53.940
in a particular temple,

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.342
that at a particular day, on a particular day if they go

00:31:57.543 --> 00:32:01.318
and hit their head to the wall of the temple,

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:02.632
then they will be blessed.

00:32:02.833 --> 00:32:04.639
SM: No, no, what I am saying, anything like that,

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.323
now we had “Devadasis”,

00:32:06.524 --> 00:32:11.383
we had the problem of [“Nathvara”] -

00:32:11.584 --> 00:32:12.948
all these problems were there.

00:32:13.149 --> 00:32:15.630
You see, there were some gurus who were doing wrong things.

00:32:15.831 --> 00:32:18.556
But they were all corrected by government, not by a... like that.

00:32:18.757 --> 00:32:21.031
SY: Yes, therefore, therefore there are laws for this.

00:32:21.232 --> 00:32:22.375
SM: There are laws for that.

00:32:22.576 --> 00:32:24.975
They have, they have no business to take law into their hand.

00:32:25.176 --> 00:32:26.120
SY: Absolutely.

00:32:26.321 --> 00:32:28.425
SM: This is the point I am trying to make.
SY: That's right, Shri Mataji.

00:32:28.626 --> 00:32:31.064
If the government comes forward we’ll  talk to them.

00:32:31.265 --> 00:32:32.407
SY: Yes...

00:32:32.608 --> 00:32:35.606
And best they can, they can go to the government

00:32:35.807 --> 00:32:37.547
and say that this is what is happening.

00:32:37.748 --> 00:32:39.151
But they cannot do themselves.

00:32:39.352 --> 00:32:42.243
SM: They cannot do. You see the...

00:32:42.444 --> 00:32:45.035
the AIG police Pune came to see Me

00:32:45.236 --> 00:32:46.964
and it said they have no right to do it.

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:48.165
SY: Absolutely.

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:50.869
And then we have to send the police here and the police there.

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:54.226
I mean they have no bases, but this is Sharad Pawar.

00:32:54.427 --> 00:32:58.902
And Rajneesh - Rajneesh has started this organisation,

00:33:02.526 --> 00:33:05.179
to create problems. They have no right.

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:08.230
Rajneesh made fun of all the deities, everything

00:33:08.431 --> 00:33:13.019
and told that these people worship [Gods] and things like that.

00:33:21.813 --> 00:33:25.395
SY: Rajneesh, his very existence, Shri Mataji,

00:33:25.596 --> 00:33:28.039
is challenged because of Sahaja Yoga, because...

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.130
SM: That’s true, but what he has done,

00:33:30.331 --> 00:33:33.214
he has paid the money to start this organisation.

00:33:33.415 --> 00:33:37.149
Now, last, last two-three years they are there.

00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:40.464
SY: Initially he was not interested in what we were doing, Shri Mataji.

00:33:40.665 --> 00:33:42.933
Only when Sahaja Yoga picked up, then...

00:33:43.134 --> 00:33:45.441
SM: No, initially also they tried to trouble us

00:33:45.642 --> 00:33:47.661
long time back, in [Israel] country.

00:33:47.862 --> 00:33:49.692
SY: Rajneesh's people?
SM: No, [unclear].

00:33:49.893 --> 00:33:51.356
SY: [unclear], I see.
SM: They hit us.

00:33:51.557 --> 00:33:55.272
But they told us we are from "Jnana probhodhini".

00:33:55.473 --> 00:33:59.155
When we inquired, they said, "We have nothing to do with these people".

00:33:59.356 --> 00:34:00.845
They are all drunkards.

00:34:01.046 --> 00:34:05.187
SY: Oh yes, they drink, most of them drink so much.

00:34:06.181 --> 00:34:09.914
SM: So they are showing Dabholkar. Why not Me?

00:34:10.801 --> 00:34:12.616
Another thing Baba, you have to take up with,

00:34:12.817 --> 00:34:15.073
is with the communication minister.

00:34:15.274 --> 00:34:16.472
Same person.

00:34:16.673 --> 00:34:19.154
That how could this Paranzape go there, Ram Paranzape,

00:34:19.355 --> 00:34:21.489
to that remote village to film Me?

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:26.106
Why the whole of this television working for these people?

00:34:26.307 --> 00:34:27.786
Who are they?

00:34:27.987 --> 00:34:30.590
SY: How did he know that such an event is going to take place?

00:34:30.791 --> 00:34:33.846
SM: No. no, they are working for him. They always project.

00:34:34.047 --> 00:34:36.311
Shyam Manav was all the time there,

00:34:36.512 --> 00:34:39.120
and this fellow was all the time there, Dabholkar and this...

00:34:39.321 --> 00:34:42.350
SY: Shyam Manav was there?
SM: Yes, on the film.

00:34:42.551 --> 00:34:44.053
SY: Was he there in the... ?

00:34:44.254 --> 00:34:45.747
SM: He was not there but on the...

00:34:45.948 --> 00:34:48.130
they show him too much on the television.

00:34:48.331 --> 00:34:50.014
SY: Yes.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.027
SM: So we should meet these central government people on television

00:34:55.228 --> 00:34:59.200
and why is it so much importance giving to this organization?

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:03.350
And what they said that they will go and open the

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.970
Samadhi of Gyaneshwara to see if he really

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:10.690
went inside or not, to see if there are bones inside or not.

00:35:10.901 --> 00:35:12.745
SY: Yes.

00:35:15.729 --> 00:35:18.701
SY: In fact Andha Shraddha Nirmulan should be the first

00:35:18.902 --> 00:35:21.173
to join Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji, because Sahaja Yoga..

00:35:21.374 --> 00:35:23.775
SM: I have done so much on this Shraddha Nirmulan.
SY: Yes.

00:35:23.976 --> 00:35:25.176
SM: But what I am saying that

00:35:25.377 --> 00:35:27.902
how they have got such authority you should ask.

00:35:28.103 --> 00:35:30.346
SY: Then they don't have, they have no authority Shri Mataji.

00:35:30.547 --> 00:35:32.754
SM: That’s what - we challenged their authority legally.

00:35:32.955 --> 00:35:33.955
SY: Yes, of course.

00:35:34.156 --> 00:35:36.129
SM: You see, if the government sees anything wrong,..

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:37.925
And also you should ask these TV people,

00:35:38.126 --> 00:35:41.285
why are they giving so much importance to them?

00:35:41.486 --> 00:35:43.610
They have brought Shyam Manav so many times there,

00:35:43.811 --> 00:35:47.793
They have got this Dhabolkar there. Why? Who is he?

00:35:47.994 --> 00:35:51.698
Just an ordinary doctor, a non-practicing doctor.

00:35:52.357 --> 00:35:54.309
They are the ones who are giving him publicity.

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.771
They said Shri Mataji is doing a perfect publicity,

00:35:56.972 --> 00:35:59.299
but they can't say I am doing it for money.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.830
They can't find it out.

00:36:01.031 --> 00:36:03.345
But they are the ones who are seeking publicity,

00:36:03.546 --> 00:36:06.415
so these people should be, another point, it's very important.

00:36:06.616 --> 00:36:08.628
You must go and see the central government and ask them how is it?

00:36:08.818 --> 00:36:10.166
and ask them how is it?

00:36:10.367 --> 00:36:12.380
SY: That they are showing them on TV.
SM: Communication matter.

00:36:12.605 --> 00:36:14.849
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:36:19.681 --> 00:36:22.828
Delhi people are little bit haphazard.

00:36:23.029 --> 00:36:24.765
Let them form a committee for this.

00:36:24.966 --> 00:36:28.457
SY: Yes Shri Mataji, I will go and meet them all.

00:36:28.831 --> 00:36:30.968
SM: They are going to see him tomorrow

00:36:31.169 --> 00:36:33.647
this gentlemen, the Home minister.

00:36:33.848 --> 00:36:37.662
Is he also dealing with the communications? They said so?

00:36:37.863 --> 00:36:40.656
SY: No idea, Shri Mataji, those ministers have been changing.

00:36:40.857 --> 00:36:45.321
SM: So this felow, is he, he's a, he is great friend of Yashwant Sinha.

00:36:45.522 --> 00:36:48.112
SY: What's his name, Shri Mataji? Sahaya?

00:36:48.313 --> 00:36:49.463
SM: Sahaya.

00:36:49.664 --> 00:36:51.283
SY: Sahaya.

00:36:51.484 --> 00:36:52.949
There have been so many.

00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:56.002
SM: But you better, you see, you should ask,

00:36:56.203 --> 00:36:57.950
you should ask them why,

00:36:58.151 --> 00:37:01.384
how can these people support this organisation.

00:37:01.585 --> 00:37:05.493
What right have they got? Now supposing somebody is a thief.

00:37:05.694 --> 00:37:07.810
All right, let the government see to it.

00:37:08.011 --> 00:37:11.037
SY: Yes.
SM: Who are you?

00:37:14.449 --> 00:37:15.640
Ananda, Andha name...

00:37:15.841 --> 00:37:18.300
In the name of Andha Shradha they have tortured many people.

00:37:18.501 --> 00:37:21.682
Police are very angry with them because they keep them so busy.

00:37:21.883 --> 00:37:23.940
SY: Yes.

00:37:28.999 --> 00:37:31.195
SM: The only thing they can do is to bring it

00:37:31.396 --> 00:37:33.140
to the notice of the government. SM: Yes, that's all.

00:37:33.341 --> 00:37:35.749
SY: That’s all, that’s all.

00:37:36.514 --> 00:37:39.801
And that’s their legal right - nothing beyond.

00:37:40.002 --> 00:37:42.583
SM: As if they are cheated themselves.
SY: Yes.

00:37:42.784 --> 00:37:45.526
SY: And if they take to pelting of stones

00:37:45.727 --> 00:37:49.890
or if they take to any violent act it is totally...

00:37:50.091 --> 00:37:53.103
SM: That's to be banned.
SY: Yes, it's totally illegal.

00:37:55.704 --> 00:37:58.151
SM: This is the point you have to make.

00:37:58.352 --> 00:38:01.425
But what should we do now?

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:03.411
When are you going to go?

00:38:03.612 --> 00:38:07.790
SY: I am in Delhi on the 23-rd night, Shri Mataji.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:10.470
But I could stay back and...

00:38:10.671 --> 00:38:12.510
SM: Go there and do it.
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:38:12.711 --> 00:38:14.711
SM: And you should go and meet communication minister.

00:38:14.902 --> 00:38:16.302
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:38:16.503 --> 00:38:18.721
SM: And tell he must pass [such strictness].

00:38:18.922 --> 00:38:21.283
How can they show Dhabolkar? Who is he?

00:38:21.484 --> 00:38:23.218
SY: Yes.

00:38:23.419 --> 00:38:27.074
That means your, your Police department is bekar [useless],

00:38:27.275 --> 00:38:30.452
your secret police is there bekar. Everybody is bekar.

00:38:30.653 --> 00:38:31.984
He's the only one

00:38:32.185 --> 00:38:35.109
most sensible, you know, like a hero in an Indian, in an Indian film.

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:38.161
SY: Yes, all wisdom personified.

00:38:39.623 --> 00:38:42.169
SM: So we have to ask some questions.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.589
Already started seeing...

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:46.365
SY: No, these signals, you know.

00:38:46.566 --> 00:38:48.839
SM: Now take out your watches, take out your watches.

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:51.856
There's no, is very bad. Don’t see your watches, just take out.

00:38:52.057 --> 00:38:53.716
I don’t wear.

00:38:53.917 --> 00:38:56.528
I know the time, Myself.

00:38:56.729 --> 00:38:59.281
Take out your watches - that makes you mad, you see?

00:38:59.482 --> 00:39:01.027
You are very time bound people,

00:39:01.234 --> 00:39:03.461
and also slaves of your watches.

00:39:03.662 --> 00:39:07.147
We never had watches before. We were quite happy.

00:39:07.978 --> 00:39:11.423
Yesterday same thing happened: we had to go to that reception.

00:39:11.624 --> 00:39:15.080
She became so nervous, her center heart was catching so badly.

00:39:15.281 --> 00:39:16.360
SY: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:39:16.561 --> 00:39:19.336
SM: And I Myself suggested that we have to go now.

00:39:19.537 --> 00:39:21.642
I have a time in My head.

00:39:21.843 --> 00:39:25.434
I've never missed a plane, I haven't missed anything.

00:39:30.409 --> 00:39:34.527
And you are not responsible for Me. I am responsible for Myself.

00:39:34.728 --> 00:39:39.384
Nor, also for Sahaja Yoga you are not responsible in a way.

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:46.641
But here, in the West, they make a time bound. Too much of it.

00:39:48.065 --> 00:39:52.525
But in India is bad manners to see watch in the presence of a saint.

00:39:52.726 --> 00:39:54.158
It's bad manners.

00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:57.269
It's sinful actually to see a watch.

00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:59.238
When you have left everything to the saint,

00:39:59.439 --> 00:40:01.380
why should you see the watch?

00:40:01.581 --> 00:40:03.881
And normally also Indians won't see a watch

00:40:04.082 --> 00:40:08.420
if they are talking to someone or... is regarded as bad manners.

00:40:08.621 --> 00:40:12.458
Indian bad manners if you see, you will be shocked.

00:40:14.131 --> 00:40:18.119
Dhara is her husband, isn't it?  You married Mr. Dhara, isn't it?

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.716
Who is a lawyer.
SY: Yes.

00:40:19.917 --> 00:40:22.592
SM: Atul.
SY: Atul, yes.

00:40:30.042 --> 00:40:32.466
SM: All right.

00:40:33.923 --> 00:40:35.944
Bhoot.

00:40:38.912 --> 00:40:41.748
This watch must be a bhoot.

00:40:41.949 --> 00:40:43.638
SY: We should shoebeat it, Shri Mataji.

00:40:43.839 --> 00:40:47.116
SM: Really shoebeat it. Give it a bhandan.

00:40:50.468 --> 00:40:53.925
Attention is, attention is the one.

00:40:54.158 --> 00:40:55.636
But if you have a proper attention

00:40:55.837 --> 00:40:59.431
immediately you know what you have to do, at what time.

00:41:01.195 --> 00:41:03.660
Like it was at 10.30.

00:41:03.861 --> 00:41:05.292
But they unnecessarily hurried

00:41:05.493 --> 00:41:08.950
and we were sitting there for half an hour.

00:41:09.818 --> 00:41:12.217
And the lady must have thought, "What's the matter with them?

00:41:12.418 --> 00:41:14.920
Why have they come so early?"

00:41:22.029 --> 00:41:26.755
One should go and live in Lucknow. You'll never do things in time.
