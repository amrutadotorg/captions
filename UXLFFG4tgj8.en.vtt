WEBVTT

02:15.542 --> 02:22.041
Today we have gathered here on the right occasion

02:24.083 --> 02:29.083
and very auspicious day to worship Shri Ganesha.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.583
Shri Ganesha is the first Deity that was created

02:40.000 --> 02:45.166
so that the whole Universe is filled with auspiciousness,

02:47.250 --> 02:55.417
with peace, bliss, and spirituality.

03:02.333 --> 03:04.250
He is the source.

03:08.417 --> 03:11.125
He’s the source of spirituality.

03:14.500 --> 03:19.291
As a result of that all other things follow.

03:21.041 --> 03:25.166
Like when it rains and is windy

03:25.166 --> 03:29.125
you feel a coolness in the atmosphere.

03:32.083 --> 03:39.166
In the same way when Shri Ganesha emits His Power

03:40.417 --> 03:45.125
we feel all these three things within and without.

03:47.291 --> 03:56.333
But it has been so unfortunate, specially in the West,

03:56.333 --> 04:07.041
that the most important fundamental Deity

04:07.041 --> 04:11.041
has been completely not only neglected,

04:11.041 --> 04:15.125
but insulted and crucified.

04:18.291 --> 04:21.583
So today though I did not want to say anything

04:23.250 --> 04:28.041
to upset you people, but I must tell you

04:28.083 --> 04:35.458
that worshiping Shri Ganesha means there has to be

04:35.500 --> 04:38.250
a thorough cleansing within you.

04:40.583 --> 04:43.000
When you worship Shri Ganesha

04:44.166 --> 04:50.125
keep your mind clean, keep your heart clean,

04:51.333 --> 04:53.250
keep your being clean -

04:53.250 --> 04:58.333
no thoughts of lust and greed should come up.

05:00.417 --> 05:02.417
Actually when the Kundalini rises

05:02.458 --> 05:06.333
Ganesha had to be awakened within us,

05:06.375 --> 05:09.000
the innocence has to come up –

05:09.041 --> 05:19.333
which obliterates all such degrading ideas within us.

05:21.583 --> 05:27.125
If ascent has to be achieved, we have to understand

05:27.166 --> 05:32.542
that we have to mature.

05:38.208 --> 05:40.125
People are sick now.

05:40.166 --> 05:45.208
All over the western life one feels they are sick.

05:45.333 --> 05:50.500
Sick because they have never recognized Shri Ganesha.

05:52.375 --> 05:58.083
If one Freud came that doesn’t mean that you should accept him.

05:58.125 --> 06:06.166
But you did - as if it was such an important thing to be done;

06:08.500 --> 06:11.333
there was nothing more important than that.

06:17.375 --> 06:23.250
So today we are faced with our power of ascent

06:24.375 --> 06:27.542
and the power of conditionings we have had.

06:28.291 --> 06:30.458
When Freud talks of conditioning he didn’t know

06:30.500 --> 06:33.542
he was putting another type of horrid conditionings on you,

06:33.583 --> 06:34.583
terrible.

06:42.291 --> 06:45.542
Sex is not important for human beings at all,

06:48.291 --> 06:50.458
is not at all important.

06:54.041 --> 06:56.583
It is only when you want to have children

06:57.000 --> 06:59.458
actually a human being

06:59.500 --> 07:03.166
who is of the highest level will indulge into a sex.

07:06.083 --> 07:09.166
The lure, the romance, this nonsense and all that

07:09.166 --> 07:14.125
doesn’t exist in a pure mind; it’s all a human creation.

07:19.208 --> 07:28.125
And this servility one has to that is so much surprising,

07:29.458 --> 07:35.458
it comes from a very low grading within us.

07:37.250 --> 07:41.125
It comes from the low-graded human beings

07:46.208 --> 07:50.083
that one becomes servile to it.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.333
You should be the master of that.

07:57.166 --> 08:01.166
And today when I see around Myself, in the West,

08:01.208 --> 08:04.333
which is also part and parcel of the same creation,

08:06.542 --> 08:15.125
so much of sickness that has come, I am really aghast,

08:17.542 --> 08:22.041
how to turn your attention now to the maturity of sex.

08:24.375 --> 08:29.125
When the sex matures you become a father, a mother,

08:30.083 --> 08:32.291
and a pure personality.

08:36.208 --> 08:39.458
When you hear about a ninety-year old woman

08:39.500 --> 08:41.291
marrying a nineteen-year old boy,

08:41.417 --> 08:43.125
I mean, you just don’t understand,

08:43.125 --> 08:48.166
this is - what sort of a society it has been created in this world,

08:48.166 --> 08:53.375
this kind of a stupid behaviour?

08:54.083 --> 08:56.166
We have to mature ourselves.

08:59.500 --> 09:04.083
That doesn’t mean I’m saying austerity at young age,

09:05.500 --> 09:10.542
that doesn’t mean that. Another absurdity is that.

09:10.583 --> 09:14.041
But of course you must mature;

09:14.041 --> 09:16.208
you need a tapasya for that.

09:19.333 --> 09:22.375
Unimportant thing when become important

09:22.375 --> 09:28.333
and such unimportant thing that they’re just like anything

09:28.375 --> 09:30.166
that we have, like we have hair.

09:30.166 --> 09:34.291
Even if you lose hair it means something.

09:35.125 --> 09:38.542
But if you lose sex, what’s wrong with it? It’s very good.

09:38.583 --> 09:42.083
Good riddance of bad rubbish.

09:42.208 --> 09:45.166
Such a waste of energy.

09:50.250 --> 09:55.500
So much interest, so much of a precious attention,

09:55.500 --> 09:58.583
so much of auspiciousness is spent

09:59.000 --> 10:01.500
in this kind of a nonsensical thing.

10:05.375 --> 10:09.250
So to worship Ganesha one has to understand

10:09.250 --> 10:10.291
we have to mature.

10:13.250 --> 10:15.500
Maturity has to come within us.

10:19.500 --> 10:23.208
We have to go deeper within ourselves;

10:23.250 --> 10:29.417
our attention has to go deeper within ourselves, spontaneously.

10:30.333 --> 10:36.166
How do we achieve the depth if we are still like worms?

10:42.250 --> 10:46.250
Otherwise it’s a great sort of a sacrifice

10:46.250 --> 10:51.250
or a pressure on people.

10:54.542 --> 11:01.291
These tags and these pressures have been very costly

11:01.291 --> 11:04.375
for you people, very costly.

11:04.375 --> 11:07.417
You have paid through so much;

11:09.083 --> 11:13.000
you have gone through so much. For what?

11:21.083 --> 11:24.583
So the priorities have to change

11:24.583 --> 11:27.458
if Shri Ganesha is to be worshipped.

11:28.542 --> 11:33.333
What are we worshipping today is the innocence within us.

11:35.083 --> 11:41.083
We are worshipping that is auspicious, which is innocent.

11:44.333 --> 11:48.375
Innocence, which is deep down within us - that’s our character,

11:48.375 --> 11:51.208
that’s our nature, that’s what we are born with –

11:54.000 --> 12:00.333
is the basic of this whole Creation;

12:02.125 --> 12:06.291
is the essence of this Creation.

12:10.208 --> 12:15.041
So when matter becomes active, all right, reproduction starts,

12:16.500 --> 12:21.041
animal stage comes in, then comes the stage of human beings

12:21.041 --> 12:23.542
who are primitive, then comes the stage

12:23.542 --> 12:27.291
where human beings are developed.

12:27.333 --> 12:32.041
Not the way what we understand of the developed world, horrible.

12:32.083 --> 12:35.208
I’ll never call them developed by any chance at all.

12:36.166 --> 12:39.000
What is development is not outside.

12:39.041 --> 12:42.458
What is the within development one has to see.

12:42.500 --> 12:45.458
What have we grown inside?

12:48.125 --> 12:51.250
What have we got inside ourselves?

12:53.333 --> 13:00.166
Anything that gross, big, is plastic, of that kind.

13:02.083 --> 13:05.208
The one which hasn’t got any inner power grown,

13:05.250 --> 13:07.583
say, for example, I give you a mango.

13:07.583 --> 13:09.291
I said, “All right, now you eat it.”

13:10.583 --> 13:14.458
And you see it just has the cover and nothing inside it,

13:14.458 --> 13:19.500
what will you eat? Will you eat that plastic?

13:23.542 --> 13:29.500
Anything that grown like that is plastic, is dead.

13:31.542 --> 13:34.208
What is the substance inside, let’s see.

13:38.250 --> 13:41.125
What is our substance within ourselves?

13:45.333 --> 13:50.333
This is what Christ preached – morality point.

13:51.375 --> 13:54.458
So important for Him it was.

13:54.500 --> 13:58.583
Because after dharma, which was a balance,

13:58.583 --> 14:02.125
where of course morality is very important,

14:02.500 --> 14:09.458
but it was necessary for Christ to talk of the innate,

14:09.458 --> 14:14.542
deeper morality, which is a part and parcel of a being,

14:14.583 --> 14:18.375
it is not just taught, or told, or frightened

14:18.375 --> 14:21.333
because there’s a fear of God and wrath of God.

14:21.333 --> 14:25.000
But it should be your own innate light,

14:25.000 --> 14:28.125
that’s why Christ talked about it.

14:30.083 --> 14:39.250
And the same Christ was used to demolish innocence.

14:44.125 --> 14:49.000
And I would not say that people were not warned.

14:49.041 --> 14:51.583
Freud was not the only person who was born.

14:53.208 --> 14:58.333
The other day I went to Prado in Spain

14:58.375 --> 15:02.542
and I saw paintings after paintings of the hell.

15:02.542 --> 15:06.583
And all these modern times we see those lanky pankies

15:07.000 --> 15:09.583
going around without clothes, sort of people were shown

15:10.000 --> 15:12.500
with all kind of funny things, stupid things they were doing.

15:12.542 --> 15:16.417
This was Bosch. I was surprised, a German, Bosch,

15:16.458 --> 15:20.125
who showed all this nonsense there, very clearly - way to hell,

15:20.166 --> 15:23.166
then the attack of the death, all these things.

15:23.583 --> 15:26.458
I mean he was quite a recent person.

15:26.500 --> 15:34.291
If you call Blake as a madcap, so what about Bosch?

15:34.291 --> 15:39.083
Everybody’s a madcap, except for the stupid useless people.

15:42.208 --> 15:50.041
So much warning has come for us. For example, we can say,

15:50.083 --> 15:53.000
since long we know about hell.

15:53.333 --> 15:57.375
Mahavira of all the persons wrote so clearly about hell.

15:57.417 --> 16:00.208
This is hell.

16:06.083 --> 16:14.375
But in the West the priorities are absolutely upside down.

16:17.250 --> 16:22.000
What is your power? Just think of it. Think within yourself.

16:22.041 --> 16:25.208
Is it mental power that’s important?

16:25.250 --> 16:28.208
I have told you mental power has nothing to do,

16:28.250 --> 16:31.500
because it is just linear, it moves in one direction, falls off,

16:31.542 --> 16:39.542
comes back to you. It has no substance in it.

16:39.542 --> 16:46.291
It’s just a mind projection, plastic.

16:48.542 --> 16:52.333
What is your emotional power?

16:52.375 --> 16:56.583
Emotions that you have takes you where?

16:59.208 --> 17:03.375
See you have emotions for, even good emotions you have.

17:03.458 --> 17:07.083
Say, you love your wife very much.

17:09.375 --> 17:11.125
Where does it take you?

17:11.166 --> 17:16.083
There was a poet called Tulsidasa who loved his wife very much

17:16.083 --> 17:18.458
and she had gone to her mother’s place.

17:19.458 --> 17:26.000
So he couldn’t bear it and went to see her

17:26.041 --> 17:33.291
and he climbed over to her balcony and she got a fright.

17:33.333 --> 17:34.291
She said, “How did you climb?”

17:34.291 --> 17:36.375
He said, “You had put a rope there.” She said, “No.”

17:36.417 --> 17:39.125
And they saw it was a big snake hanging.

17:41.291 --> 17:45.083
So she said, “The amount of love you have for me,

17:45.083 --> 17:47.458
if you have that for God, where will you be?”

17:53.375 --> 17:57.166
So where does these emotions take you - to frustration,

17:57.208 --> 18:00.375
to unhappiness, to our destruction.

18:03.375 --> 18:07.417
The mental power gives you a horrible thing called ego,

18:07.417 --> 18:10.125
which destroys others.

18:10.125 --> 18:12.375
And the emotional power gives you

18:12.417 --> 18:17.542
nothing but crying, weeping, and always feeling unhappy,

18:17.583 --> 18:21.333
“Oh, I have done so much of emotional investment

18:21.375 --> 18:24.375
on such and such person and what did I get?”

18:30.583 --> 18:34.166
So it is not absolute, it’s relative.

18:35.500 --> 18:39.000
And mentally you are zero if you cannot destroy others.

18:39.041 --> 18:42.125
Emotionally you are zero

18:42.166 --> 18:50.125
because you cannot overpower people with your emotions.

18:54.542 --> 19:00.041
So what is your power? Where does your power lie?

19:03.000 --> 19:08.208
It lies in the Spirit. But even before the Spirit is achieved,

19:08.208 --> 19:14.417
what is your power? Is Kundalini? She’s sleeping.

19:14.458 --> 19:17.500
Then what is your power?

19:17.500 --> 19:23.333
Is your chastity.

19:24.542 --> 19:31.000
If a man is chaste, chaste temperament he has

19:31.041 --> 19:43.583
and he stands up in his chastity, it acts, it works.

19:49.542 --> 19:56.000
But first of all chastity pays dividend in your good health.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.166
From the face of a person you can say

20:02.208 --> 20:04.375
that this person is a chaste man.

20:04.375 --> 20:15.166
Like in our Shastras used to say a Saint or a brahmachari,

20:15.166 --> 20:17.458
the one who has never had sex in life,

20:17.458 --> 20:20.166
always shining on his face.

20:20.208 --> 20:25.500
And as we say that the greatest brahmachari was Shri Krishna

20:25.542 --> 20:28.041
who has so many wives.

20:34.500 --> 20:40.166
Because no wastage of energy, no wastage of attention is on that.

20:40.166 --> 20:42.583
So the whole energy is inside.

20:43.000 --> 20:46.500
I will say today as I was coming by car it was raining,

20:46.542 --> 20:51.375
it was windy, it was very cold, but we were in the car,

20:51.375 --> 20:59.083
nothing affected us, because we were quite warm inside the car,

20:59.083 --> 21:03.083
ourselves. We passed through everything, nothing touched us,

21:03.125 --> 21:09.458
nothing bothered us, we came away, everything fine. How?

21:09.458 --> 21:14.583
Because we kept to our own vehicle

21:14.583 --> 21:19.375
and the vehicle we have is our chastity.

21:24.125 --> 21:27.041
We are so particular that others must respect us,

21:27.083 --> 21:31.083
other must give us homage, otherwise we get into tempers.

21:34.500 --> 21:41.500
Did you respect yourself? Do you respect yourself?

21:47.333 --> 21:50.458
It sounds sometimes to people in the West

21:50.500 --> 21:56.458
that Mother is very trying to preach about Indian culture.

21:56.458 --> 21:59.458
Many people think that way.

22:01.458 --> 22:05.583
But I say that one has to learn science from the West.

22:06.000 --> 22:10.125
All right. One has to learn other things from the West,

22:10.166 --> 22:13.208
aesthetics, of course.

22:14.500 --> 22:19.083
Paintings and art, maybe, colour schemes.

22:21.166 --> 22:24.125
But culture you better learn from Indians.

22:29.208 --> 22:33.125
There’s dearth of culture, no culture at all, I find.

22:34.500 --> 22:39.291
What is this culture where a woman is supposed to expose her body?

22:39.291 --> 22:44.583
Is a prostitute’s culture, simple as that. Face it up.

22:55.333 --> 22:59.542
Where a woman is not supposed to respect her private parts

22:59.583 --> 23:05.041
is no culture whatsoever in the aesthetics of the Divine.

23:08.125 --> 23:15.041
So much so today that they are making a film showing Mary

23:15.041 --> 23:20.375
to be a prostitute. I mean, this is where you have ended up.

23:21.125 --> 23:26.250
In India even if you say this they’ll beat you nicely - anyone,

23:26.291 --> 23:28.417
whether Muslim, Hindu, Christian.

23:30.083 --> 23:34.458
I mean, shocking to hear that the way they talk about Christ.

23:34.458 --> 23:37.417
I mean, to an Indian it gives a shock.

23:37.458 --> 23:44.000
How can you talk because once you give up your chastity

23:44.041 --> 23:49.083
you can not understand that there can be someone

23:49.083 --> 23:51.458
who is absolutely chaste.

23:52.333 --> 23:55.083
For a thief everybody is a thief.

23:59.458 --> 24:04.166
Because you don’t have that respect for your chastity

24:04.166 --> 24:08.208
you can not imagine what Christ could have been.

24:08.208 --> 24:10.333
You can not imagine, you can not accept.

24:14.291 --> 24:17.500
Unbearable things are said about Christ.

24:17.542 --> 24:20.083
I tell you, unbearable, I don’t know.

24:20.125 --> 24:27.500
I’ve faced His crucifixion, which was unbearable as it was.

24:27.542 --> 24:32.041
But this kind of a thing you say about somebody;

24:32.041 --> 24:36.291
to an Indian woman if you pass such a remark,

24:36.291 --> 24:39.250
to an Indian ordinary woman, she would commit suicide.

24:52.083 --> 24:55.208
Is never said that anybody comes and says,

24:55.250 --> 24:57.250
“You looking very beautiful.” It’s all right,

24:57.291 --> 24:59.375
you can say to your mother, “you’re looking nice,” is all right,

25:00.291 --> 25:02.375
that’s different. But you don’t say to any woman like that.

25:12.333 --> 25:15.542
You have to turn yourself out.

25:15.583 --> 25:22.166
And this is one of the reasons why

25:22.166 --> 25:25.166
people are very hot-tempered.

25:28.542 --> 25:35.333
The magnet within you is Shri Ganesha.

25:38.333 --> 25:41.208
Many people know that I have a great sense of direction.

25:41.250 --> 25:44.500
That comes through this magnet which is perfect.

25:44.542 --> 25:53.083
This magnet is the one which keeps you sticking or adjusted

25:53.083 --> 25:58.125
or all the time pointed towards Spirit.

25:58.125 --> 26:05.250
If you don’t have the sense of chastity you will dangle this way,

26:05.291 --> 26:08.333
that way. Suddenly you become a very good Sahaja Yogi,

26:08.333 --> 26:09.542
tomorrow you become a devil –

26:11.166 --> 26:17.250
because there’s nothing that keeps you binding

26:20.500 --> 26:29.291
to the great idea of the Spirit. Let us face it up.

26:29.333 --> 26:32.417
Now the time has come for all of us, all the Sahaja Yogis,

26:34.291 --> 26:39.125
that the greatest thing within us is not sex, but is chastity.

26:49.542 --> 26:53.166
And that’s what will mature you.

26:58.208 --> 27:03.458
It’s very amazing how some people were behaving in Bordi,

27:03.458 --> 27:05.583
I came to know about it, I was amazed,

27:05.583 --> 27:10.000
how could they behave like this before the villagers of Bordi,

27:10.000 --> 27:12.083
who are innocent, simple people?

27:17.208 --> 27:22.125
But the best part of it that when you indulge into frivolous

27:22.166 --> 27:28.250
and nonsensical behaviour, insulting your chastity,

27:28.291 --> 27:31.458
you really lag in the action of it.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.583
Like, if you fritter away your petrol, your car can’t move,

27:36.583 --> 27:38.583
it’s like that, something happens to you.

27:43.166 --> 27:45.417
All the time you go on pinching people

27:45.417 --> 27:49.166
and frivolously talking to each other and to,

27:49.208 --> 27:52.125
what is the need to do all these, I just don’t understand.

27:52.125 --> 27:54.542
And then end up in the divorce case.

27:56.542 --> 27:58.583
Once I had gone to a Selfridges,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.083
I must tell you a very interesting story.

28:01.083 --> 28:05.583
And in such a crowd there were two people, man and woman,

28:06.000 --> 28:07.375
kissing each other all the time,

28:07.375 --> 28:09.333
least bothered there are other people

28:09.375 --> 28:12.291
who are also going on the same escalator.

28:12.291 --> 28:16.250
Escalator they were kissing, in the thing they were kissing,

28:16.250 --> 28:19.500
I mean, torturing all the Indians who were there

28:19.500 --> 28:23.166
or maybe the other people, Chinese, for example, Egyptians.

28:23.208 --> 28:31.542
Such an exhibition going on. And I saw them next time.

28:31.583 --> 28:35.166
They were not kissing.

28:35.208 --> 28:36.291
I said, “What happened?”

28:36.333 --> 28:38.083
“We are divorced.”

28:41.000 --> 28:43.083
I said, “Why were you kissing that day so much?”

28:43.125 --> 28:46.417
So they said, “Because we were going to be divorced,

28:46.458 --> 28:49.041
so wanted to have the last bit of it.”

28:50.291 --> 28:55.166
What a level it is. Imagine what a level. What love,

28:55.166 --> 29:00.166
what feeling you have for anyone, nothing of the kind.

29:04.291 --> 29:06.333
All the time quarrelling with each other,

29:06.375 --> 29:13.542
ending up in the divorce cases and showing off all this.

29:13.583 --> 29:19.208
Any deep personality doesn’t show these things outside.

29:19.208 --> 29:24.125
Of course, I’m told here that here in the public school it is said

29:24.125 --> 29:26.458
that you should never show your emotions outside.

29:28.583 --> 29:31.041
But otherwise you can show anything else,

29:31.041 --> 29:36.041
ridiculous or shameless. But not your emotions.

29:37.417 --> 29:40.417
What an absurd place it is.

29:45.417 --> 29:48.208
You have accepted all these values

29:50.000 --> 29:52.458
just like sheep, without thinking about it.

29:58.333 --> 30:02.000
Like I was in France, one girl came and she was crying.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.208
She said, “I will - horrid, horrid,

30:04.250 --> 30:08.291
I will never go to these psychologists.”

30:08.333 --> 30:10.041
So I said, “Why?”

30:10.083 --> 30:12.458
“They were saying dirty things about my father.”

30:13.583 --> 30:15.458
Imagine.

30:19.417 --> 30:23.375
And people accepted those ideas of this horrible Freud.

30:27.125 --> 30:31.250
Is basically wrong. Whether it is historically they are,

30:31.291 --> 30:33.125
or whatever it is, you better give it up.

30:34.583 --> 30:40.500
Whatever wrong is wrong, in the Divine.

30:40.542 --> 30:43.542
Whatever is right is right, in the Divine.

30:48.291 --> 30:52.208
But there’s a real objection now,

30:52.208 --> 30:54.458
that people when they go abroad,

30:54.458 --> 30:58.083
husband and wife and this and that, they kiss each other

30:58.125 --> 31:00.000
and tease each other. What is the need?

31:01.000 --> 31:03.417
You kiss the person and come and tell Me against that person,

31:03.417 --> 31:11.500
I’ve seen it. If there has to be some self-preservation,

31:11.542 --> 31:16.250
this has to be your chastity, your privacy.

31:17.500 --> 31:21.208
That’s why you have no willpower to do anything, no willpower.

31:21.208 --> 31:24.000
Let some stupid fellow come and tell you something,

31:24.000 --> 31:27.333
you’ll say, “All right. We accept.”

31:31.041 --> 31:35.208
What is the essence of your personality – is your chastity.

31:38.500 --> 31:42.166
And in Sahaja Yoga you can re-establish everything

31:42.166 --> 31:45.041
whatever you have lost, you can.

31:45.500 --> 31:48.291
That’s why the depth is lacking.

31:54.500 --> 31:58.333
And this is the reason there is no consistency

31:58.375 --> 32:03.208
in the temperament of people, no consistency.

32:05.417 --> 32:09.458
Now you’ll get twelve hundred people for My lecture

32:09.500 --> 32:13.083
and next day not even one, all lost.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.417
Because there’s no base, you know. Like a loose connection.

32:19.041 --> 32:24.000
There’s no connection, connection point is your chastity.

32:26.458 --> 32:30.583
So there is no consistency, sthaapayati is not there.

32:32.375 --> 32:35.083
If you tell them, “You have to get up in the morning,

32:35.125 --> 32:40.375
have a bath, do some puja,” it’s too much for them.

32:47.208 --> 32:54.333
But if you tell, say an Indian ladies or Me, if you say that

32:54.333 --> 32:56.375
“that you wear such and such dress,”

32:56.417 --> 33:03.083
I just can’t, I just can’t, no, not possible. Is not possible.

33:03.083 --> 33:06.125
I can keep the whole night awake,

33:06.166 --> 33:08.542
but that thing I can not do, just cannot do it.

33:11.375 --> 33:15.500
So the priorities are changed because where is your attention.

33:19.375 --> 33:22.542
You have everything within you.

33:22.542 --> 33:28.333
You are the storehouse of chastity, which is your power.

33:28.333 --> 33:33.333
Everything within you, nothing has gone out, it’s all there.

33:33.333 --> 33:40.000
All that fragrance is within you. Is all preserved,

33:40.000 --> 33:45.041
don’t condemn yourself. And you are so fortunate

33:45.041 --> 33:47.291
I’m here to tell you all about it.

33:47.333 --> 33:50.417
You are so fortunate I am with you.

33:50.458 --> 33:52.542
Do you understand that point?

33:55.083 --> 33:56.542
You don’t have to go to Himalayas;

33:56.583 --> 33:59.417
you don’t have to stand on your heads.

34:02.250 --> 34:04.583
You don’t have to do anything like that.

34:04.583 --> 34:10.041
You see, formerly these saints used to sit, you know,

34:10.041 --> 34:16.291
you won’t believe, in the cold frozen water or on the Himalayas

34:16.291 --> 34:20.333
in the open they used to sit for hours together

34:20.375 --> 34:25.291
Now that’s not necessary.

34:25.333 --> 34:30.333
It’s all made very easy. But change your priorities now.

34:34.291 --> 34:38.417
The whole attention once goes to your own Spirit

34:38.458 --> 34:46.208
you’ll be surprised the whole chart will change.

34:48.250 --> 34:52.500
What’s the most important thing? To meditate every day.

34:55.166 --> 34:58.500
I have seen people who want to do some course, say, for example,

34:58.500 --> 35:00.375
I told that “You better do some course.”

35:00.417 --> 35:04.542
Every day they will go for that course and join that class

35:04.583 --> 35:08.250
and they will work it out and they’ll pass that course

35:08.250 --> 35:12.041
and do it up and finish it.

35:12.041 --> 35:16.041
But meditation they cannot do regularly.

35:20.083 --> 35:25.083
But now there’s a little gap you should understand,

35:26.250 --> 35:36.291
that once we get the inkling of that joy which is eternal,

35:38.000 --> 35:41.250
we start moving towards that more and more,

35:41.291 --> 35:44.500
more and more and establishing ourselves

35:44.500 --> 35:47.500
in the ocean of that joy.

35:47.542 --> 35:54.083
A little. You see, when somebody wants you to swim,

35:54.125 --> 35:58.375
you are frightened, you don’t want to do it,

35:58.375 --> 36:01.333
you are very happy on the gross shore,

36:01.375 --> 36:05.375
you don’t want to swim. Somebody pushes you,

36:05.417 --> 36:08.166
again you are back, “No, baba, I can not do it.”

36:08.208 --> 36:13.250
But once you learn to swim you enjoy that swimming.

36:14.417 --> 36:17.542
And when you like it then you want to do it every day,

36:17.542 --> 36:20.125
regularly, religiously.

36:22.208 --> 36:27.375
So there’s a little gap, which has to be achieved.

36:27.417 --> 36:33.417
Second point is that as I’ve been always saying,

36:33.458 --> 36:37.417
you are lotuses, but under a mire.

36:37.417 --> 36:40.166
And you know what mire is,

36:40.208 --> 36:47.375
while India is the ocean, so it’s very easy for the lotuses

36:47.375 --> 36:50.333
to come out of the water.

36:50.333 --> 36:54.208
But to come out of the mire is very difficult.

36:58.083 --> 37:01.208
Say, somebody falls in the mire.

37:02.125 --> 37:05.041
If you kick it, you go deeper.

37:05.041 --> 37:08.000
If you try to do anything you go deeper.

37:08.041 --> 37:12.083
Best thing is to keep watching it and still.

37:12.083 --> 37:16.458
And that’s the best way – is to witness yourself.

37:16.500 --> 37:20.125
But your attention is not all right, how will you witness?

37:20.125 --> 37:23.041
Attention is: somebody’s going that side –

37:23.041 --> 37:25.417
that person you’ll see. Another person going that –

37:25.417 --> 37:28.000
that person you’ll see, must see every person.

37:29.291 --> 37:34.250
But you don’t see the flowers, you don’t see the trees,

37:34.291 --> 37:38.125
you don’t see the Mother Earth, you don’t see anything.

37:38.125 --> 37:47.125
What you see is something hopelessly bad, worse than you.

37:52.333 --> 37:55.291
Today is the day they say one should not see the moon.

37:56.583 --> 38:00.375
If you see the moon it becomes inauspicious

38:00.375 --> 38:03.166
and you get a bad name. They say Shri Krishna saw the moon

38:03.166 --> 38:07.041
and then He got a bad name; He was ranchordas,

38:07.083 --> 38:09.417
means He had to run away from the battlefield.

38:09.417 --> 38:11.417
But that was His trick, He had to run away.

38:11.458 --> 38:13.125
So you are not supposed to see the moon.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.458
The reason is, why it is said,

38:15.458 --> 38:18.166
that today we have to see Shri Ganesh,

38:18.208 --> 38:20.500
who is the Mother Earth,

38:22.041 --> 38:23.542
who acts through Mother Earth.

38:23.542 --> 38:28.458
Most of the things that we have are from the Mother Earth.

38:31.125 --> 38:33.417
So this time you must see the Mother Earth,

38:33.417 --> 38:40.041
the Kundalini and Shri Ganesh, today.

38:41.166 --> 38:45.375
The Mother Earth has created Shri Ganesha.

38:45.375 --> 38:50.000
So you don’t see anything outside, you don’t even see the moon.

38:50.041 --> 38:53.375
Just see the Mother Earth.

39:02.333 --> 39:05.583
Because the Mother Earth in Her love

39:05.583 --> 39:09.333
and compassion has done so much for us,

39:09.333 --> 39:12.208
your Kundalini has done so much for you.

39:15.166 --> 39:20.333
And Her Son, Who is the innocence within us,

39:20.333 --> 39:26.583
is to be worshipped today because He has done the maximum.

39:26.583 --> 39:31.583
Despite all the insults we have put on Him, all the ridicule,

39:32.000 --> 39:36.083
all the filth, all kinds of nonsense,

39:36.083 --> 39:40.208
still He stands up like a little child to amuse us.

39:47.208 --> 39:50.375
If Shri Ganesha is within you become like a child,

39:50.417 --> 39:56.333
childlike innocence, you don’t get angry with somebody

39:56.375 --> 39:59.417
like a dog barks; there are some Sahaja Yogis I know

39:59.458 --> 40:04.000
who all the time barking, just like dogs or beggars in India.

40:09.083 --> 40:13.375
But you become like a child who is very sweet,

40:13.417 --> 40:16.291
who always tries to amuse you,

40:16.333 --> 40:19.291
always tries to say nice things,

40:19.333 --> 40:25.000
always tries to make you feel happy. The source of such joy.

40:29.083 --> 40:33.291
And that’s how you become a source of joy,

40:33.333 --> 40:39.291
source of happiness, source of fulfilment.

40:43.542 --> 40:47.458
All the time bubbling with laughter and happiness,

40:47.500 --> 40:55.041
bubbling with beautiful things. How the children amuse you,

40:55.041 --> 40:57.125
just see and watch.

40:57.125 --> 41:01.458
How they come round with little-little hands,

41:01.500 --> 41:03.542
how they work it out.

41:07.208 --> 41:10.333
How they know what is the right thing.

41:10.333 --> 41:14.166
A child who is a Realized soul is much more sensible

41:14.166 --> 41:16.375
than a grown up person, I’ve seen that.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.375
Like My youngest granddaughter was about, I think,

41:22.375 --> 41:28.333
three years of age and the maid was folding My sari

41:28.333 --> 41:32.000
and by mistake she put it on the ground.

41:32.000 --> 41:37.041
This child just couldn’t bear it. She just lifted the sari,

41:37.041 --> 41:41.208
put it to her head and put it on the sofa.

41:41.208 --> 41:44.166
She said, “What you mean by putting this sari on the ground,

41:44.208 --> 41:46.125
what you do know about my Grandmother?

41:46.166 --> 41:48.542
She is the Goddess of Goddesses

41:48.583 --> 41:51.333
and you put Her sari on the ground.

41:52.583 --> 41:59.208
The dogs are going to bite you now,” she said, “Be careful.”

41:59.250 --> 42:03.333
And she again went and put the sari, kissed it and kissed it

42:03.333 --> 42:07.166
and said, “Mother, forgive her, Grandmother, please,

42:07.208 --> 42:11.083
forgive this woman, she doesn’t know what she’s done to You”.

42:16.250 --> 42:25.250
But that sensitivity comes from the depth of your chastity.

42:32.208 --> 42:34.458
You listen to the children and you’ll be amazed

42:34.458 --> 42:38.417
how they talk and what they say, how they behave,

42:38.458 --> 42:42.041
how they try to amuse you. I mean,

42:42.041 --> 42:44.166
in the West children are very much spoiled, I must say,

42:44.166 --> 42:46.583
they do not amuse you so much, they trouble you quite a lot.

42:48.417 --> 42:53.000
Because again, again the same thing.

42:54.291 --> 42:57.041
If the father and mother don’t have chastity,

42:57.083 --> 43:02.291
the children don’t feel all right, they don’t feel peaceful,

43:02.333 --> 43:05.125
they’ll become restless, and then they develop

43:05.166 --> 43:07.375
the same restlessness within themselves.

43:07.417 --> 43:12.458
A chaste man can never get possessed, take it from Me,

43:12.458 --> 43:21.000
can never get possessed. You might be very intelligent,

43:21.000 --> 43:23.458
you might be anything, you might be a great writer,

43:23.500 --> 43:26.500
but you can get possessed. But a chaste man,

43:26.542 --> 43:29.291
an ordinary chaste person can never get possessed.

43:29.291 --> 43:31.208
Bhoots are afraid of chaste people.

43:31.208 --> 43:35.083
If one chaste person is going on the road, all the bhoots run away.

43:39.208 --> 43:44.333
They just run away. At least I’ve known many cases

43:44.333 --> 43:48.000
but some of them I can tell you,

43:48.000 --> 43:54.083
that there were three of them,

43:54.125 --> 44:03.458
who used to go by motorcycle in the night

44:03.500 --> 44:05.500
about twelve o’clock on a road.

44:08.250 --> 44:14.333
And some people who were possessed wrote letters to Me,

44:14.333 --> 44:21.125
saying that “Please don’t allow them to go there in the night,

44:21.125 --> 44:23.375
because where should we go and stay?”

44:23.417 --> 44:28.542
I was amazed. These are the people

44:28.542 --> 44:31.208
who were possessed by some sort of horrible bhoots

44:31.208 --> 44:34.417
who used to go and rest on these trees in the night

44:34.417 --> 44:37.583
where these three persons used to go on the motorcycle

44:38.000 --> 44:40.333
and they actually wrote letters to Me.

44:40.333 --> 44:43.208
Very possessed people, I knew them, saying that,

44:43.208 --> 44:47.417
“Ask them not to go that way, because where are we to live?”

44:49.041 --> 44:52.542
And they were like mad, mad people themselves.

44:52.583 --> 44:54.542
I said, “Why did you write like this?”

44:54.583 --> 44:58.542
They said, “These people go that way and they trouble us.”

45:06.250 --> 45:13.458
And the negative within us disappears

45:13.500 --> 45:16.417
with the light of Shri Ganesha.

45:21.000 --> 45:24.208
You can see it so clearly in another person.

45:25.583 --> 45:29.041
If you don’t have chastity you can never see

45:29.041 --> 45:32.041
who is unchaste or chaste, you can not.

45:32.041 --> 45:35.125
Everybody just the same, “Very good, very good,

45:35.125 --> 45:37.000
very nice person, very nice person”.

45:40.083 --> 45:45.583
I mean real possessed people are certified as very good people,

45:46.000 --> 45:50.125
in Sahaja Yoga also sometimes and I start wondering,

45:50.125 --> 45:55.083
“What’s happening, what is it? How is it these people

45:55.125 --> 46:02.208
are certified as that? Can’t they feel it?” There’s no light.

46:03.583 --> 46:05.583
Even if you get your Realization,

46:06.000 --> 46:12.500
even if your Spirit is working out your collective consciousness,

46:12.542 --> 46:15.458
even if you are giving Self Realization to others,

46:15.500 --> 46:19.375
you are nowhere if you have no chastity.

46:24.500 --> 46:28.333
That’s like a broken glass which is trying to reflect something;

46:28.375 --> 46:30.542
it can never give the right picture.

46:32.291 --> 46:37.000
It’s so important. And I have to tell you this now.

46:37.041 --> 46:41.500
The time has come for Me to tell you – this is the snag in our life.

46:44.417 --> 46:48.500
First thing people will ask, “Whom I’m going to marry?”

46:48.500 --> 46:55.375
What is such a hurry? Of course, marriage I call it

46:55.375 --> 46:58.083
an auspicious thing, marriage should be there,

46:58.083 --> 47:01.041
there should be a collective sanction, everything, but for what?

47:02.417 --> 47:07.375
To adore the chastity within us. Then they are married,

47:07.417 --> 47:10.083
then they have children. Then they want to have a house,

47:10.125 --> 47:11.583
then they want to have this.

47:12.000 --> 47:16.291
There’s whole such an insular business goes on, and on, and on,

47:16.291 --> 47:20.125
and the light of your life doesn’t spread.

47:25.083 --> 47:28.291
But I’ve known people who were just in the hell

47:28.333 --> 47:31.000
and have come out and have spread light,

47:31.041 --> 47:39.041
beautiful meteoric heights they have achieved.

47:39.041 --> 47:40.583
I’ve seen people like that.

47:45.000 --> 47:49.000
So today you have come to worship Shri Ganesha - within yourself.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.500
What is Me to worship as Ganesha I don’t understand.

47:56.333 --> 48:02.250
Because I’m That. When you are worshiping Me

48:02.291 --> 48:05.375
you want to have that Shri Ganesh within you awakened.

48:09.125 --> 48:11.542
Let that be awakened within you.

48:11.542 --> 48:17.000
Let what I say becomes the mantra to awaken that within you,

48:17.041 --> 48:24.000
so that as My children you enjoy the bliss of chastity

48:24.041 --> 48:29.125
as I have enjoyed all My human life and all My Divine lives.

48:31.250 --> 48:34.500
You enjoy the same quantity, that’s what I want.

48:34.542 --> 48:37.333
At least you should have the taste of it.

48:42.417 --> 48:44.333
I’m telling you about something

48:44.333 --> 48:46.333
which you may not have heard before.

48:46.333 --> 48:49.083
But you never heard about Kundalini also.

48:49.125 --> 48:53.166
You had never heard about Self Realization like this.

48:54.333 --> 48:59.500
But today I think by chance, absolutely in a Sahaja way,

48:59.500 --> 49:04.500
this Puja was arranged. I was to have this Puja in Bombay.

49:04.542 --> 49:09.458
It was all organized; people were all willing to come there

49:09.458 --> 49:15.458
to do this puja. I mean, a Ganesha Puja in England

49:15.458 --> 49:21.000
or in the West is so important that I thought better have it one,

49:21.041 --> 49:26.166
without the right time in Rome,

49:26.208 --> 49:31.417
which is one of the basic things

49:31.417 --> 49:34.250
which has ruined the chastity of human beings.

49:38.000 --> 49:42.000
Romans started it and others carried on.

49:43.000 --> 49:56.041
But it was to be here in Brighton at the Lotus Feet of Sadashiva.

49:56.083 --> 49:59.458
But the English must know

50:01.000 --> 50:06.125
that they have got such a golden land

50:06.166 --> 50:12.542
and they don’t deserve it. They have to deserve it.

50:14.458 --> 50:19.417
Imagine, you are living in the land of Sadashiva

50:21.583 --> 50:26.208
where even water beads also the snow –

50:26.250 --> 50:29.417
means like distilled water, clean, clear, white.

50:32.375 --> 50:35.125
Where Shri Ganesha is the One

50:36.583 --> 50:40.041
Who washes the feet of His Father.

50:42.500 --> 50:48.000
Where the chastity itself resides as your Mother.

50:50.375 --> 50:55.583
And you have to deserve that coveted position.

50:58.375 --> 51:01.458
English Sahaja Yogis have to come up very much.

51:02.542 --> 51:06.000
Just the opposite English were.

51:09.250 --> 51:14.375
Coming from Sadashiva’s land just the opposite.

51:14.375 --> 51:25.208
Tremendous arrogance, arrogance so horrible,

51:25.250 --> 51:28.458
which one can not think in Shiva’s place.

51:35.375 --> 51:39.250
All unchaste people are arrogant.

51:40.333 --> 51:43.291
Otherwise, how can they forgive themselves?

51:46.125 --> 51:49.417
You talk to any prostitute, in two minutes you’ll find out

51:49.417 --> 51:51.583
she’s a prostitute because she’s extremely arrogant,

51:51.583 --> 51:55.166
“What’s wrong? I’m a prostitute, so what?”

52:05.458 --> 52:10.458
Arrogance is a sign of unchaste personality.

52:13.333 --> 52:16.083
And such a person also becomes insular

52:16.125 --> 52:22.000
because he’s ashamed, ashamed to face others.

52:26.458 --> 52:29.333
But a chaste personality is open,

52:29.375 --> 52:32.083
why should he be afraid of anyone?

52:34.375 --> 52:37.125
Talks to everyone nicely,

52:37.125 --> 52:42.125
kind to everyone in all innocence and simplicity

52:42.166 --> 52:45.458
without falling in love in every third person you come across.

52:57.000 --> 53:04.583
And that, one has to realize that this country is given to you

53:04.583 --> 53:10.291
with a purpose and if you do not come up to that level,

53:10.291 --> 53:12.375
you’ll be thrown away.

53:21.333 --> 53:28.000
So respecting your chastity is real respecting Me,

53:28.041 --> 53:32.208
because I reside within you as chastity.

53:36.041 --> 53:39.583
If Shri Ganesha is the auspiciousness,

53:39.583 --> 53:43.291
I reside within you as chastity.

53:47.458 --> 53:49.542
Chastity is never aggressive,

53:49.583 --> 53:55.041
is never harsh, because there’s no need, you know.

53:58.166 --> 54:01.500
No need, you are so powerful, you are so powerful,

54:01.542 --> 54:04.208
that there is no need to aggress anyone.

54:04.250 --> 54:06.500
Why should you aggress, you are not frightened of anyone.

54:06.542 --> 54:13.417
It’s so generous, it’s so kind, it’s so beautiful,

54:16.000 --> 54:23.333
always fresh and young, yet so sublime and so dignified.

54:28.417 --> 54:31.291
Now twelve years have passed since I’ve been here.

54:31.291 --> 54:36.458
Two more years, very intense work is needed,

54:36.500 --> 54:42.000
within and without. Within we have to work very hard

54:42.000 --> 54:44.250
for these two years, very hard,

54:44.250 --> 54:47.250
real tapasya we have to go into,

54:50.500 --> 54:55.125
all of us, whether men or women.

55:00.583 --> 55:03.542
And then we’ll see.

55:06.083 --> 55:13.333
I can say that, we have done good job,

55:15.041 --> 55:22.166
with little jump, courage and faith we can achieve a lot.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.083
Have faith in yourself.

55:28.291 --> 55:37.000
Not mental faith but actual chastity is faith.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.583
Chastity is the consolidation of your faith.

55:49.291 --> 55:52.333
When you have faith in God, you are chaste.

55:52.375 --> 55:55.458
When you have faith in yourself you are chaste.

55:55.458 --> 55:58.250
You have faith in your wife, you are chaste.

55:58.250 --> 56:00.041
Why should you have faith in your wife?

56:00.041 --> 56:04.125
Because you are a chaste person, how can she be unchaste?

56:04.166 --> 56:09.458
Your faith in your child - is chastity, because you are chaste,

56:09.500 --> 56:12.417
how can your child be anything else?

56:17.000 --> 56:21.083
Crystalline form of faith is chastity.

56:22.333 --> 56:27.458
And that you can have even before Realization. Many have.

56:28.417 --> 56:35.500
Actually like the camphor, which, you see,

56:37.041 --> 56:41.000
is volatile and evaporates into the fragrance,

56:41.041 --> 56:48.291
in the same way we can say chastity acts into faith.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.458
If you don’t have chastity you cannot have faith,

56:51.500 --> 56:54.041
in anything.

56:55.333 --> 56:58.417
Because either you are dealing with your emotions

56:58.458 --> 57:00.375
that you are emotionally attached to Me

57:00.375 --> 57:02.583
or maybe you are mentally attached to Me.

57:03.250 --> 57:08.375
But if you have sense of chastity faith will be apparent.

57:08.417 --> 57:11.333
Within yourself you don’t have to have faith,

57:11.375 --> 57:15.041
“Now Mother I will have faith within myself.” You cannot.

57:19.083 --> 57:23.500
Faith is something, which is volatile

57:26.375 --> 57:32.208
and the volatile fragrance comes from chastity.

57:35.083 --> 57:40.000
So from today we are not going to look at the stars or the moon,

57:40.000 --> 57:42.583
but you are going to look at the Mother Earth.

57:45.250 --> 57:51.417
In the Universe She represents the Kundalini,

57:51.417 --> 58:00.208
is nothing but chastity. She’s just chastity.

58:01.000 --> 58:08.166
Can you believe it? What a power.

58:14.125 --> 58:19.166
Motherhood, everything is chastity.

58:22.166 --> 58:26.125
Fatherhood, any relationship is chastity.

58:30.000 --> 58:34.166
Purity is again the fragrance of chastity.

58:35.291 --> 58:40.000
Goodness, compassion, everything comes from chastity,

58:40.000 --> 58:42.542
a sense of chastity, which is not mental.

58:42.542 --> 58:45.166
If you are mentally chaste, you can be horrid.

58:46.375 --> 58:50.208
Like some of the nuns are or some of those people

58:50.250 --> 58:52.125
who are austere, not that.

58:52.166 --> 58:58.166
Chastity is an innate built-in Kundalini within you,

59:01.500 --> 59:09.208
which acts because it understands Me.

59:09.208 --> 59:12.000
She understands Me. She knows Me,

59:12.041 --> 59:14.500
She’s part and parcel of Me, It’s My reflection.

59:17.083 --> 59:21.125
So make your Kundalini strong by being chaste.

59:23.375 --> 59:27.417
People try to do things to look very attractive and this and that.

59:27.417 --> 59:30.000
Don’t waste your energy like this;

59:30.041 --> 59:32.125
you are saints, live like saints.

59:36.291 --> 59:42.250
Traditionally as we live, we have to live that way

59:42.250 --> 59:46.375
and evolve out of the tradition; don’t do something new,

59:46.417 --> 59:49.583
something absurd, nonsensical.

59:50.458 --> 59:52.500
We don’t have to attract anyone.

59:52.500 --> 59:57.208
Chastity is the fragrance in the flower,

59:58.333 --> 01:00:01.250
which attracts the bees,

01:00:03.041 --> 01:00:05.458
is the honey of the flower,

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:09.208
is the essence of our existence.

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:23.333
So this time you are all coming to India,

01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:31.250
I have to request you to respect Me by not misbehaving.

01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:37.542
Not childishly behaving in the manner you see in the pictures

01:00:37.583 --> 01:00:39.583
and the films and all that nonsense.

01:00:39.583 --> 01:00:42.041
You are above all that.

01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:58.458
Attention, achievements are to be seen

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.083
from the seat of your chastity.

01:01:07.083 --> 01:01:09.291
We can’t leave our seats,

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:13.125
whether we are acclaimed or not makes no difference.

01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:14.417
We can’t leave our seat.

01:01:14.458 --> 01:01:18.375
Like all these avadhootas they’ll say,

01:01:18.417 --> 01:01:21.458
takiya sodaa sana - means we’ll not leave our seats.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:32.083
We are in our seats. This is our seat, in the lotus.

01:01:34.125 --> 01:01:41.583
We can’t leave the lotus. We are sitting in the lotus.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.542
That’s our seat. Then all these nonsensical things

01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:51.041
that you have acquired will drop out.

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:52.583
You’ll see you’ll become beautiful being.

01:01:57.250 --> 01:02:01.417
All bhoots will run away, all catches will run away.

01:02:05.375 --> 01:02:09.250
But is not austerity, again and again I’m telling you.

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:18.542
It is respect of your Being. As you respect Me outside,

01:02:18.583 --> 01:02:26.375
you respect Me within. As simple as that.

01:02:26.417 --> 01:02:33.583
Today is a great day for us to be worshipping Shri Ganesh.

01:02:36.375 --> 01:02:39.583
He is the first and the foremost to be worshipped.

01:02:46.125 --> 01:02:50.000
And when you worship Him, you must realize

01:02:51.083 --> 01:02:54.041
that you are worshipping His manifestation as well,

01:02:54.083 --> 01:02:59.000
that is of Christ. Anybody who talks cheaply about Christ,

01:03:00.041 --> 01:03:02.166
you should abhor such a person.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:07.250
You cannot intellectualize Christ. Anybody who does it,

01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:09.417
just have nothing to do with that person.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:20.083
Christ is innocence.

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:26.250
If you don’t have the depth of your chastity

01:03:26.291 --> 01:03:30.291
you can’t understand Him. You cannot worship Him.

01:03:37.166 --> 01:03:40.458
That’s the best they could do, is to finish your chastity

01:03:40.458 --> 01:03:42.542
so that you never recognize Him.

01:03:52.083 --> 01:03:56.375
All that comes to you through your meditative efforts.

01:03:56.375 --> 01:04:01.375
Now the effort is to be just that you have to be meditative.

01:04:01.417 --> 01:04:06.542
That’s all. Keep your meditation on.

01:04:06.583 --> 01:04:09.083
Try to be meditative. See things.

01:04:09.083 --> 01:04:12.291
What is witness state is nothing but that you are meditative.

01:04:16.291 --> 01:04:24.375
So I have decided also that I’ll meet the Brighton people

01:04:24.375 --> 01:04:32.500
here tomorrow morning and I will meet all the English people

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:36.291
if possible day after tomorrow evening

01:04:38.333 --> 01:04:45.458
to tell them how important it is for them to achieve

01:04:47.041 --> 01:05:00.166
that state of purity. I think it’s working out.

01:05:00.166 --> 01:05:02.458
I really work very hard,

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.333
you have no idea how much I work hard.

01:05:05.375 --> 01:05:10.208
But this is also they said that, is an idea that people think

01:05:10.208 --> 01:05:12.542
that others should do all their work.

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:17.083
This is like pound saving, this saving, that saving

01:05:17.125 --> 01:05:22.458
and also labour saving. Let Mother do all the job for us.

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:25.417
Mother is looking after us. She should get up in the morning.

01:05:25.458 --> 01:05:27.208
She should do meditation.

01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:35.458
There is no saving.

01:05:36.583 --> 01:05:41.333
You can save everything else if you just know

01:05:41.375 --> 01:05:48.083
how to save your Spirit. Only your ascent is important.

01:05:48.083 --> 01:05:51.166
Once you ascend, everything is saved.

01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:54.500
But first save yourself.

01:05:56.542 --> 01:06:01.166
For that you have to put in effort. You have to work hard.

01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:06.542
You have to go deep into you, evolve yourself.

01:06:06.583 --> 01:06:12.417
You are quite capable of it. Do not blame anyone;

01:06:12.417 --> 01:06:16.125
do not blame your wife, mother, father, country anything.

01:06:16.125 --> 01:06:18.542
Everyone can work it out.

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:22.000
Don’t see other people, see yourself,

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.542
“How far I have gone? What have I contributed?

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:29.375
Let me go ahead with it.” Every one of you.

01:06:32.083 --> 01:06:34.166
I am thankful that all the people

01:06:34.208 --> 01:06:37.250
have come from all over England.

01:06:38.291 --> 01:06:40.458
It was right thing to do it in a way,

01:06:42.125 --> 01:06:46.583
but this country must be created of that level

01:06:47.375 --> 01:06:51.125
that it becomes pilgrimage for everybody to come here.

01:06:55.208 --> 01:06:57.041
On the contrary it should not happen

01:06:57.083 --> 01:06:58.417
that once they come to England,

01:06:58.458 --> 01:07:00.417
after that they never come to Sahaja Yoga.

01:07:01.333 --> 01:07:09.542
Could happen, could happen with the arrogance

01:07:09.542 --> 01:07:13.333
that people have may be that it might become like that,

01:07:13.583 --> 01:07:15.542
that once they come here they’ll say,

01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:18.125
“No more Sahaja Yoga, had enough of it.”

01:07:20.583 --> 01:07:24.500
The other way round in India, once they go to India they stick on it.

01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:29.542
I have known some people that they came to England

01:07:29.542 --> 01:07:32.458
and the way they, some of the Sahaja Yogis behaved

01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:36.291
and some of the ashrams run, they just ran away.

01:07:36.333 --> 01:07:37.417
“Mother nothing doing,

01:07:37.458 --> 01:07:40.125
we are not going to be in Sahaja Yoga anymore

01:07:40.125 --> 01:07:44.041
after seeing your developed Sahaja Yogis in England

01:07:44.083 --> 01:07:46.125
where you have worked for twelve years.”

01:07:49.333 --> 01:07:57.083
So today we are sitting on this beautiful land of England

01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:03.417
and we have certain debts to be paid,

01:08:04.542 --> 01:08:07.458
to be born in this country,

01:08:09.083 --> 01:08:14.458
and the debt is that we have to be great Sahaja Yogis.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:21.375
You can make out, very easily, who is a great Sahaja Yogi.

01:08:21.375 --> 01:08:26.166
When you say that, “shut that window,”

01:08:27.083 --> 01:08:30.166
you’ll find most of them will be sitting looking at others.

01:08:30.208 --> 01:08:33.583
I don’t say they are all English but could be.

01:08:39.458 --> 01:08:44.458
Make others work is not the way.

01:08:44.458 --> 01:08:47.291
You have to be really very dedicated.

01:08:47.333 --> 01:08:51.083
You are not of that level, believe Me you are not of that level.

01:08:51.083 --> 01:08:54.291
Don’t look at other people who are here.

01:08:54.291 --> 01:08:57.166
You are very different type of people. You are special people.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:07.542
Try to be alert, respect yourself because you are English

01:09:07.542 --> 01:09:11.166
and that you have a special responsibility.

01:09:14.125 --> 01:09:18.500
So may God bless you.

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:13.208
All the way he has brought the water of River Godhavari

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:19.041
which flows in the Nasik, in the river, Nasik.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:23.500
You see you know that where Shri Rama and Shri Sita

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:26.250
and Lakshmana all lived there in Nasik.

01:10:28.083 --> 01:10:32.625
And this river is called as the Ganges of the south. Godhavari.

01:10:35.417 --> 01:10:42.000
He got the water from Godhavari. See the vibrations flowing.

01:10:44.041 --> 01:10:47.375
In the country where the rivers even are mantras,

01:10:47.375 --> 01:10:53.542
their names are mantras - the whole credit goes to the Saints,

01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:06.458
to the people who lived so religiously and so much full of purity

01:11:06.458 --> 01:11:10.208
that the rivers, even if you take their names the vibration comes.

01:11:15.458 --> 01:11:21.375
See? Why not one day Thames becomes like that?

01:11:21.417 --> 01:11:29.250
Through your punyas it should be.

01:11:30.166 --> 01:11:45.500
Every particle of this earth should become vibrated

01:11:47.166 --> 01:11:49.458
through your punyas only.

01:11:57.291 --> 01:12:04.083
Now we have to see that Shri Ganesha state.

01:12:05.166 --> 01:12:09.250
The people who have to worship, we have to see

01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:12.041
who are the people who have to worship.

01:12:15.208 --> 01:12:17.250
Very difficult situation.

01:12:52.333 --> 01:12:56.375
Get the small children, that’s the best.

01:12:57.583 --> 01:13:00.208
Come along. Nira. Come along.

01:13:04.417 --> 01:13:10.125
Yes, yes you both come along.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:21.458
Very good. Great. Below ten years. All right. Sit down.

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:44.291
All of them should be below ten years.

01:13:57.208 --> 01:14:00.291
Not below two but below ten.

01:14:00.291 --> 01:14:03.291
All right. Come, come, come, all of you.

01:14:15.333 --> 01:14:28.166
Very good children, must say.

01:14:28.166 --> 01:14:30.250
Tremendous they are. Aren’t they?

01:14:30.250 --> 01:14:37.083
What we are going to do is to wash Mataji´s Feet.

01:14:37.083 --> 01:14:40.250
Alright? How do we wash, she is putting water on my Feet

01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:42.500
and you just have to rub. Alright.

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:45.083
Come along, four at the time.

01:14:45.083 --> 01:14:46.458
Now who are the four?

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:50.166
She will put the water,

01:14:50.166 --> 01:14:53.291
you rub, now you rub It,

01:14:53.291 --> 01:14:56.166
you rub My Foot.
