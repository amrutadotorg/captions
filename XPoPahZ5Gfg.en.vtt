00:06:03.103 --> 00:06:06.263
I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:06:30.236 --> 00:06:34.076
In this beautiful surround, surroundings,

00:06:36.578 --> 00:06:47.608
many of you are wondering why God has created these beautiful things.

00:06:47.688 --> 00:06:51.528
Because you people had to come on this Earth

00:06:51.608 --> 00:06:55.414
and enjoy the beauty that is one of the reasons.

00:06:55.494 --> 00:07:01.690
And now God feels very much fulfilled

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:16.736
with the joy and satisfaction and a kind of a completion of His desire.

00:07:16.817 --> 00:07:26.118
Why God has created this beautiful universe
has been a question

00:07:26.198 --> 00:07:29.903
asked for thousands of years.

00:07:32.109 --> 00:07:38.176
The reason is very simple to understand:

00:07:38.256 --> 00:07:45.562
this beauty that is created cannot see itself.

00:07:45.763 --> 00:07:56.013
In the same way, God who is the source
of beauty, cannot see its own beauty,

00:07:56.093 --> 00:08:01.027
like a pearl cannot enter into itself to see its beauty,

00:08:01.108 --> 00:08:07.515
like the sky cannot understand its own beauty,

00:08:07.595 --> 00:08:12.814
the stars cannot see their own beauty,

00:08:12.894 --> 00:08:24.772
the Sun cannot behold its own brilliance.

00:08:24.853 --> 00:08:34.661
In the same way God Almighty cannot behold His own being.

00:08:34.741 --> 00:08:37.991
He needs a mirror

00:08:38.071 --> 00:08:45.935
and that is how He has created this
beautiful universe as His mirror.

00:08:46.015 --> 00:08:52.482
In this mirror He has created now beautiful things like the Sun,

00:08:52.562 --> 00:08:59.380
then the Sun has to see his own reflection also.

00:09:00.821 --> 00:09:06.530
So, he has created these beautiful trees to see that

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:14.102
when he shines, they come up so well and look so green.

00:09:14.182 --> 00:09:19.306
Then He has created those birds to rise early in the morning

00:09:19.386 --> 00:09:26.653
to greet the Sun, so the Sun knows that: “Yes, I am there, I am existing”;

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:32.623
or else He has created these beautiful lakes
for these trees to see their reflection

00:09:32.809 --> 00:09:39.363
and the lakes to feel their existence when the
ripples start moving within themselves.

00:09:39.543 --> 00:09:43.013
So then He created human beings.

00:09:43.093 --> 00:09:47.942
The human beings cannot also see their own beauty, their own glory.

00:09:48.022 --> 00:09:52.173
That is why they are in the darkness, they are ignorant.

00:09:52.253 --> 00:09:57.716
They cannot see what lies within themselves.

00:09:57.796 --> 00:10:05.072
So they are running after something
which is absolutely against themselves,

00:10:05.153 --> 00:10:11.385
which is ugliness, which is self destructive.

00:10:11.484 --> 00:10:17.312
And the struggle to get to is such a lot,

00:10:17.392 --> 00:10:20.767
that as a result, they destroy themselves.

00:10:20.848 --> 00:10:26.235
Like as people have taken to these drugs, taken to all bad
habits

00:10:26.315 --> 00:10:29.733
– of in this place, they say a lot of smuggling going on –

00:10:29.813 --> 00:10:35.004
and all such endeavors that people take up because they do not know

00:10:35.084 --> 00:10:37.643
what beautiful things they are.

00:10:37.723 --> 00:10:43.840
So now a mirror has to be created for them,
to see for themselves how beautiful they are.

00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:47.974
Their mirror is their Spirit.

00:10:48.054 --> 00:10:53.221
That Spirit is to be brought in their consciousness, their attention.

00:10:53.301 --> 00:10:58.630
If it comes in their attention then they can see their image.

00:10:58.723 --> 00:11:08.731
Now this attention that comes in as an enlightened attention

00:11:08.811 --> 00:11:14.783
is called in Sanskrit language as chidabhas

00:11:14.863 --> 00:11:20.745
is the expression of the attention which is enlightened.

00:11:20.825 --> 00:11:27.967
But it is also said that it is got a nature, which is very transitory,

00:11:28.047 --> 00:11:33.959
or, we can say, which is disappearing every moment to moment.

00:11:34.039 --> 00:11:38.064
When
this is happening what is to be done?

00:11:38.144 --> 00:11:44.199
For that you have to steady yourself with meditation,

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:49.938
with hearing the enlightened talks,

00:11:50.018 --> 00:11:58.893
by seeing the good things of life without thinking about them,

00:11:58.973 --> 00:12:03.655
by seeing also the goodness of others

00:12:03.735 --> 00:12:07.937
and then you start seeing
goodness in yourself also.

00:12:08.017 --> 00:12:11.793
That is why I always say that one should not feel guilty.

00:12:11.873 --> 00:12:20.125
Because you are feeling guilty of something, which is just, just an illusion.

00:12:20.219 --> 00:12:25.150
You are guilty that you have got a shadow. It is something like that.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.825
So if you know that you are beautiful beings

00:12:28.905 --> 00:12:34.673
and that you have got a shadow is nothing to do with you and your beauty.

00:12:34.753 --> 00:12:41.282
If you can see you own beauty then you will be amazed that within us lies

00:12:41.363 --> 00:12:47.551
all those joy giving, all those beautiful
things, which we are seeing outside.

00:12:47.631 --> 00:12:50.231
But just now, the mirror is not all right,

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:53.519
that’s
why you have to see in the nature the beauty.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:13:03.927
But, when you are one with your Self, then
you see all these nature within yourself,

00:13:04.008 --> 00:13:07.663
all the joy giving qualities of this nature within yourself.

00:13:07.743 --> 00:13:14.223
So I wanted you to come to this place just
to learn how God has created this beautiful

00:13:15.649 --> 00:13:20.830
area for you people to enjoy and to be here.

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:23.043
May God bless you.
