00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:03.642
Public Program, Royal Albert Hall, London,
11 June 1992

00:01:36.936 --> 00:01:44.977
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:01:46.383 --> 00:01:55.060
At the very outset we have to know that truth
is what it is.

00:01:55.112 --> 00:01:59.812
We cannot change it.

00:01:59.812 --> 00:02:02.922
We cannot conceptualize it.

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:05.451
We have to know it.

00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:14.351
For example, today science has become our
God.

00:02:14.351 --> 00:02:19.952
But you can’t know truth through science.

00:02:19.952 --> 00:02:34.802
It may solve some problems, one by one, but
it is not conclusive.

00:02:34.802 --> 00:02:40.082
It doesn’t reach you anywhere.

00:02:40.082 --> 00:02:46.544
It has created this problem, as you know,
the conference in New York from where the

00:02:46.544 --> 00:02:49.282
Goddess [sounds like a person’s name] has
come just now.

00:02:49.282 --> 00:02:53.731
[?] was telling Me the story that they don’t
know what to do, how to solve the problem.

00:02:53.731 --> 00:02:57.152
Then the violence.

00:02:57.152 --> 00:03:03.332
It cannot stop violence because it is amoral.

00:03:03.332 --> 00:03:04.792
It has no morality in it.

00:03:04.792 --> 00:03:09.962
It doesn’t tell you how to transcend.

00:03:09.962 --> 00:03:15.202
It doesn’t tell you that you are a spirit.

00:03:15.202 --> 00:03:24.091
He doesn’t know we can say it does not know
what the soul is.

00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:35.152
It does work out in a way, but I must say
Sahaja Yoga works out much faster, in a much

00:03:35.152 --> 00:03:36.341
simpler way.

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:42.002
And if you take to Sahaja Yoga you’ll be
convinced, despite all your conditionings

00:03:42.002 --> 00:03:57.012
and cynicism, that Sahaja Yoga is the Meta
Science, is above science, above.

00:03:57.012 --> 00:04:08.182
With Sahaja Yoga, once you get your realization
automatically you get cured, automatically.

00:04:08.182 --> 00:04:15.982
This Kundalini which is your Mother, individual
Mother, She rises, passes through these centers

00:04:15.982 --> 00:04:23.672
and these centers are the basics within us
because when they are in your body you get

00:04:23.672 --> 00:04:29.092
all these troubles, sicknesses, cancer, all
kinds of incurable diseases, all kinds of

00:04:29.092 --> 00:04:34.563
mental troubles and spiritual problems due
to wrong seeking.

00:04:34.563 --> 00:04:44.342
I have seen people in England itself, so many
of them got rid of their drug addiction overnight

00:04:44.342 --> 00:04:47.071
with Kundalini awakening.

00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:51.342
It is their own power which has worked it
out.

00:04:51.342 --> 00:04:53.532
It does work.

00:04:53.532 --> 00:05:02.612
There are three doctors in Delhi University
who have got their MD in curing incurable

00:05:02.612 --> 00:05:04.702
diseases.

00:05:04.702 --> 00:05:16.612
We have people definitely suffering from all
kinds of problems of muscular disabilities

00:05:16.612 --> 00:05:24.722
or cancers of various types, even AIDS, I
would say.

00:05:24.722 --> 00:05:26.972
It has worked wonders with that.

00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:31.411
No doubt it works.

00:05:31.411 --> 00:05:32.521
How?

00:05:32.521 --> 00:05:38.602
There is another science beyond this science.

00:05:38.602 --> 00:05:43.791
There is another world beyond this world which
we do not know, about which all the saints

00:05:43.791 --> 00:05:44.791
have told us.

00:05:44.791 --> 00:05:51.792
The vision of that great life is described
by a great seer.

00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:59.302
We call it a [Brachta?], a great visionary,
William Blake of this country.

00:05:59.302 --> 00:06:05.692
He said the sleeping Albion, the sleeping
country, has to awake and arise.

00:06:05.692 --> 00:06:09.561
That was not imagination.

00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:14.452
That was his real penetration into the reality
which he described.

00:06:14.452 --> 00:06:17.422
But science cannot go into that dimension.

00:06:17.422 --> 00:06:31.262
That exists for all of us but we are so conditioned
that we cannot accept it that such a thing

00:06:31.262 --> 00:06:32.262
can exist.

00:06:32.262 --> 00:06:39.292
I don’t know when it started the deviation,
maybe Galileo’s invention of a telescope,

00:06:39.292 --> 00:06:40.292
maybe.

00:06:40.292 --> 00:06:50.552
I don’t know what happened that people started
giving up philosophy and taking to science,

00:06:50.552 --> 00:06:58.982
to economics, and now everything has become
nothing but economics and money, everything.

00:06:58.982 --> 00:07:09.852
You can’t find truth by paying.

00:07:09.852 --> 00:07:17.721
But one has to think there must be something
else; otherwise are we all going to be destroyed

00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:27.621
by these unlimited endeavors we have in all
kinds of destructive areas.

00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:31.542
Science was all right to begin with but it
has no limitation.

00:07:31.542 --> 00:07:38.932
It doesn’t keep to that point where now
we have started derailing into our destruction.

00:07:38.932 --> 00:07:44.412
Where have we gone wrong?

00:07:44.412 --> 00:07:45.811
We have no control.

00:07:45.811 --> 00:07:49.642
We have no discretion.

00:07:49.642 --> 00:07:54.132
So people turn, say, to religion.

00:07:54.132 --> 00:08:03.982
Now religion is also, as you know, is a farce
because it is also money-oriented or it is

00:08:03.982 --> 00:08:04.982
power-oriented.

00:08:04.982 --> 00:08:06.072
It is not at all spirit-oriented.

00:08:06.072 --> 00:08:07.392
No religion is now today.

00:08:07.392 --> 00:08:13.142
Take any religion, whether they like it or
not.

00:08:13.142 --> 00:08:25.422
Of course the prophets, the incarnations,
the seers, the saints, sages, all of them

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:28.272
knew the truth.

00:08:28.272 --> 00:08:34.112
They were absolutely there where we have to
go.

00:08:34.112 --> 00:08:43.832
But later on people thought it is not reality;
what we discovered through science is reality.

00:08:43.832 --> 00:08:51.151
If it is so, why such problems are coming
to us?

00:08:51.151 --> 00:09:00.122
Why all our enterprises are boomeranging on
us?

00:09:00.122 --> 00:09:08.692
We don’t even realize that we are becoming
now slaves of this so-called modern scientific

00:09:08.692 --> 00:09:13.262
world.

00:09:13.262 --> 00:09:17.852
We can’t calculate two plus two.

00:09:17.852 --> 00:09:29.802
Also it’s very surprising that we do not
realize how we are playing into the hands

00:09:29.802 --> 00:09:34.392
of entrepreneurs.

00:09:34.392 --> 00:09:40.742
My granddaughters were with Me in Italy and
they wanted to buy some nice long skirts because

00:09:40.742 --> 00:09:44.862
they are still, you see, not so much sophisticated.

00:09:44.862 --> 00:09:52.322
And you’ll be surprised; no shop had any
skirts of that kind.

00:09:52.322 --> 00:09:59.172
They had now only of six inches and eight
inches because somebody, some mad person,

00:09:59.172 --> 00:10:05.232
must have taken out this idea in Paris and
we have to wear those dresses.

00:10:05.232 --> 00:10:07.162
Otherwise we are not in.

00:10:07.162 --> 00:10:09.272
People will laugh at us.

00:10:09.272 --> 00:10:10.622
If you wear long [Shri Mataji said “long”
but She meant to say “short”] dresses

00:10:10.622 --> 00:10:12.292
in this cold, imagine!

00:10:12.292 --> 00:10:14.022
Especially in England.

00:10:14.022 --> 00:10:17.432
What’s the sense in wearing these short
dresses?

00:10:17.432 --> 00:10:19.122
I can’t understand.

00:10:19.122 --> 00:10:30.102
I can understand in a place on the Equator
where it is so hot.

00:10:30.102 --> 00:10:42.192
Nonsensical inventions come out and we think,
“Oh, it’s great because it is new.”

00:10:42.192 --> 00:10:45.362
What are we going to do with these telescopes?

00:10:45.362 --> 00:10:47.316
What is the need to go to the moon?

00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:48.941
What did you achieve?

00:10:48.966 --> 00:10:51.906
Did you solve the problem of poverty in our
country?

00:10:51.906 --> 00:10:55.516
[She said first “in this” then corrected
“in our country”.]

00:10:55.516 --> 00:10:56.706
Wasted so much money.

00:10:56.706 --> 00:11:06.736
So there is an inborn force in all our adventures
which tries to bring us down, put us down.

00:11:06.736 --> 00:11:09.856
Now the psychological problem is another.

00:11:09.856 --> 00:11:15.195
That’s a force, inner force which is working
out and teaching us.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.236
Sickness is another.

00:11:17.236 --> 00:11:25.116
When you do things which are not natural,
go to the extremes, sickness comes in.

00:11:25.116 --> 00:11:29.126
There is no discretion.

00:11:29.126 --> 00:11:30.846
There is no direction.

00:11:30.846 --> 00:11:34.235
We do not know what is our future is.

00:11:34.489 --> 00:11:37.589
Now science has discovered DNA.

00:11:37.589 --> 00:11:41.059
Of course, scientist are quite shocked by
that.

00:11:41.059 --> 00:11:43.459
It’s a big question mark for them.

00:11:43.459 --> 00:11:45.699
But they’ll go to DNA.

00:11:45.699 --> 00:11:49.479
They’ll try to find out what was the origin
of man.

00:11:49.479 --> 00:11:51.339
What is the need to know the origin of man?

00:11:51.339 --> 00:11:55.469
We should know the future of man now.

00:11:55.469 --> 00:12:00.039
If you know what is the origin, what are you
going to gain out of that?

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:01.279
Have you to become now animals?

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:06.189
Or have you to become something higher?

00:12:06.189 --> 00:12:22.719
In this great country of England there have
been great seers who have talked about, who

00:12:22.719 --> 00:12:33.759
have wrote about the great visions they had
about the English, the Wales, the Scots.

00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:42.559
But they were considered as mad people because
our conditionings are such that we don’t

00:12:42.559 --> 00:12:47.729
think it is mad to become punk or to become
a hippy.

00:12:47.729 --> 00:12:49.892
We don’t think that way.

00:12:50.098 --> 00:12:54.259
The other day I saw a gentleman with big holes
in his pant.

00:12:54.394 --> 00:12:56.819
I asked him, “What’s this going on?”

00:12:56.819 --> 00:12:58.889
He said, “It’s a holey pant.”

00:12:58.889 --> 00:13:00.959
[Indian words sounds like jailwai]”.

00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:09.249
And I said, “But mister, this holey pant
will give you some sort of trouble because

00:13:09.249 --> 00:13:12.649
it’s a very cold country.”

00:13:12.649 --> 00:13:15.089
“No, we are having a holey pant.”

00:13:15.089 --> 00:13:22.139
To dress up funny, to make your hair in a
funny way, is that’s the way you are going

00:13:22.139 --> 00:13:26.729
to change yourself inside?

00:13:26.729 --> 00:13:28.189
What is the reason?

00:13:28.189 --> 00:13:31.909
Why we cannot solve our ecological problem?

00:13:31.909 --> 00:13:37.489
Is the human being, he has to transform himself.

00:13:37.489 --> 00:13:44.549
And when he is transformed, the first thing
which happens to him that he becomes collectively

00:13:44.549 --> 00:13:45.689
conscious.

00:13:45.689 --> 00:13:53.449
You start feeling others on your fingertips,
you can feel others their centers, you can

00:13:53.449 --> 00:14:00.019
feel others, and an upsurge of compassion,
upsurge.

00:14:00.019 --> 00:14:15.649
I went to Russia and I was surprised in Russia
that so many Germans, Germans Sahaja yogis

00:14:15.649 --> 00:14:17.959
flew to help Me out.

00:14:17.959 --> 00:14:21.302
So surprised at them.

00:14:21.846 --> 00:14:23.376
I said, “You’re given up your jobs or
something?”

00:14:23.401 --> 00:14:25.392
They said, “No, we are taking a leave and
come.”

00:14:25.417 --> 00:14:26.417
I said, “Why?”

00:14:27.067 --> 00:14:29.681
“Mother, don’t you think it is our responsibility?

00:14:29.705 --> 00:14:33.456
What our forefathers have done we have to
rectify.

00:14:33.481 --> 00:14:37.220
We have to help them.”

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:43.580
We talk of democracy, this liberal democracy.

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:53.240
Churchill himself has said that is the worst
type of government is democratic, but I don’t

00:14:53.240 --> 00:15:01.170
know anything of better; so better have it.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:06.121
All these things make you abnormal when you
have so many choices.

00:15:06.121 --> 00:15:11.670
Choices of what?

00:15:11.695 --> 00:15:18.790
Choices of clothes, choices of food, choices
of these stones and ashes.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:25.142
What about the choice of our future life?

00:15:25.205 --> 00:15:28.229
What about the progeny that is going to come?

00:15:28.254 --> 00:15:30.425
What are we going to give them?

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:32.814
Plastics?

00:15:35.322 --> 00:15:45.045
Then some people intelligent, you have to
have superior type of intelligence.

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.189
Think about it.

00:15:48.214 --> 00:15:52.000
There must be some solution; so they become
seekers.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:03.240
William Blake has said, he called them men
of God, and they will seek and they will become

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.300
Divine and they’ll make others Divine.

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.880
He has prophesized it.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:15.740
All his prophecies can be absolutely executed,
can be manifested in this great country of

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.370
Great Britain.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:23.690
But first we should get out of our conditionings.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:38.360
The first conditioning is that anything which
comes from East is stupid, while anything

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.220
that comes from West is the best.

00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.450
Of course, one has to learn about science.

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.010
One has to learn about so many things.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:50.270
There are so many good things about West.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:57.300
But if in the East there is something good,
after all we human beings only separate East,

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:02.480
West, North, South, Black, White, this, that.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.710
God does not.

00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:09.490
So if there is something that is going to
nourish our roots, whether it comes from East,

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:13.340
North, South, anywhere, why not take it?

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:17.410
Whatever is good for our benevolence, why
not accept it?

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:18.900
All right.

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:24.590
Then people came out with these ideas, and
I am sorry to say from our India lots of horrible

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:30.135
people were exported.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.790
And thousands and thousands joined these hypocritical
people.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:39.340
But for Sahaja Yoga, no.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:43.900
Because what is the basic difference in Sahaja
Yoga and any other nonsensical thing like

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.890
that is that here you cannot pay.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:52.450
You have to become.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:55.330
What is important is what you become.

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:57.260
You cannot become a member of Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.260
You cannot.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:04.250
We do not have any organization like that.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:11.730
You have to become yourself ,and there is
divinity all within yourself.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:16.550
I verily say to you that, “Don’t condemn
yourself.”

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:19.220
By no means.

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:31.390
You are at the epitome of evolution, and what
you have to get is just humble down and see

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:34.910
for yourself that in your heart resides the
spirit.

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:42.300
And you have all the divinity, all the powers
which are above this science.

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:49.220
For a diagnosis of a person, they will kill
that person with that diagnosis in the medical

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:50.220
profession.

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:57.760
But in Sahaja Yoga anybody can tell you what’s
wrong with you on the fingertips.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:01.850
It’s a fact.

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:05.950
It’s the truth.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:12.200
But how many years it’s going to take for
people to accept the truth?

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:19.070
As it is I’ve been here for eighteen years;
no, this is the nineteen year I am here.

00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:27.190
Whatever one may say what Marx has done, Marxism,
one has to ask question.

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:33.120
He could have been right in some ways, and
when I went to Russia I did feel that one

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:38.910
thing he did was take out the attention of
people from materialism.

00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:40.970
It’s a fact.

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:47.280
We always had sixteen thousand, twenty thousand
people and in one place called [Togliati]

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.640
there are twenty thousand Sahaja Yogis practicing
Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:20:00.670
One day this Russia will be the greatest country,
if not India.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:05.520
If we have lost our soul, if we have lost
our connection with that Divine Power which

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:11.200
is the Power of God Almighty, then what are
we going to be left with?

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:13.610
What are we going to win?

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.850
Drug addicts?

00:20:15.850 --> 00:20:16.970
AIDS?

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:18.090
Homosexual?

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.330
This nonsense?

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.570
That nonsense?

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.906
We should have our self-esteem.

00:20:25.961 --> 00:20:31.890
We must know that God has not created us to
be wasted like this.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:38.770
It’s the first time I allowed them to show
some of these pictures because I know the

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:43.230
mind here is so clever that they can cheat
themselves.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:48.200
They start saying, “Oh, this must be arranged.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.200
This must be organized.”

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.370
For what should we arrange and organize logically?

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:54.610
We are well-off people.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:58.920
We have nothing to gain from you.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:04.840
We don’t need any money.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:12.830
The people now who have come to Sahaja Yoga
are angelic people; you’ll be surprised.

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:18.560
We have no difference of races, no difference
of religion, no difference of nationality

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:22.830
and all these things that create problems.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:29.430
We believe in all the prophets and all the
religions but we do not hate any religion.

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.810
We are not fundamentalist.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:37.270
That’s why all the fundamentalists are angry
with us, because how dare you love all the

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:40.420
religions, because they are all one.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:45.000
Fundamentally they are one, which you can
understand once you get your realization.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:52.570
After realization you can feel the truth on
your fingertips and you can find out all these

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:54.070
people who they were.

00:21:54.070 --> 00:22:02.010
Christ Himself has said, “Those who are
not against Me, are with Me.”

00:22:02.010 --> 00:22:03.331
Who are those?

00:22:03.331 --> 00:22:08.001
All this fundamentalism has created a problem
today and that is the greatest problem, as

00:22:08.001 --> 00:22:16.410
good as ecological problem, I think.

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:23.250
We have people from all the religions, as
I told you, and the compassion and love that

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.630
they have.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:33.460
I’ve never seen them fighting, quarrelling,
hitting, violent, abusing.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:41.000
Such decent, beautiful citizen they have become.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.920
Honest.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.000
We all have to be like that.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.410
Only thing you must know your own powers.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:53.860
You must know what you are.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.100
And the truth is that you are the spirit.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.020
You are not this body, not this mind.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.520
You are the spirit which you have to become.

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:11.420
And the another truth is that there is an
All-pervading Power which you may call by

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:17.980
any name, like “Ruh”, like the All-pervading
Power of Divine Love, or Brahmachaitanya.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:21.890
Call by any name, it’s there.

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:24.270
You have to just get connected with it.

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.080
All the powers start flowing through you.

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:35.460
Do you mean to say that all these great saints
and incarnations and prophets were telling

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.350
us lies?

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:52.290
But not just reading their books, not by reciting
their names, not by being fundamentalist;

00:23:52.290 --> 00:24:01.620
but by becoming a realized soul that you understand
every one of them.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:10.950
You integrate within yourself and without.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:23.390
Tomorrow I am going to tell you what the spirit
works out in you when you get your Self-realization,

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.420
and also we’ll have a session of Self-realization.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:28.700
Today not, tomorrow.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:38.160
First, you just don’t be thinking about
it, arguing about it.

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.160
You cannot argue.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.350
It is beyond your mind.

00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:49.330
And it is not Aristotle did say that there
is a world beyond the moon and one below the

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:50.330
moon.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:51.330
We live in the below the moon.

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:55.730
But there is another world beyond which we
have to know.

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:59.440
All of you have the right to know.

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.610
And Sahaja means born with you.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:06.110
Is the right to get union with that All-pervading
Power.

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:10.050
Is your birthright and you all can have it.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:14.720
So why not have it?

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.230
Of course, there are many fundamentalists
who may write against us, because they think

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:21.670
we go against them.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.120
It’s not a fact.

00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:29.050
They do not want you to change.

00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:35.690
They want you to belong to their clubs by
which they could fight, denounce others.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:42.060
The whole world is created by One God.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:46.120
How can we fight in the name of God?

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.120
Not only fighting.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.210
They are doing all kind of things.

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.190
You know that.

00:25:50.190 --> 00:25:54.190
All kinds of horrible things they are doing
in the name of God.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:57.920
But after realization, we don’t have to
tell you anything.

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.860
You just do what is righteous.

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:09.150
You become that kind of a personality, so
powerful as that, I assure you.

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:13.350
Tomorrow, please, all of you come along again.

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:15.690
Today there was a bomb scare.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:16.690
Imagine!

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:20.250
What a stupid thing people are doing wasting
their life.

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:25.060
For what did you come on this earth?

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:29.870
To create bombs, scare, kill people, murder
someone?

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:34.680
I mean, they are worse than animals sometimes.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.290
Tomorrow call also your friends, everyone.

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:44.640
First time in England we have spoken so openly
about Sahaja Yoga, because they always said,

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:50.040
“Mother ,if You say something very openly,
they will never understand.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.040
You should not tell them.

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:58.960
You should try to pamper their ego all the
time and should not say much about Sahaja

00:26:58.960 --> 00:26:59.960
Yoga.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.380
Let them get their realization.”

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:07.480
And you will be surprised; the reaction was
that we may have people about, say, three

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:11.000
hundred, four hundred, out of which two would
come to the program.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.960
Even Indians here are, I must say.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.960
Not in India.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.970
In India thousands, thousands have taken to
Sahaja Yoga, thousands.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:29.070
It is their heritage, but they have also lost
their heritage and they are doing such a tremendous

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.900
work.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:38.730
With Sahaja Yoga you can nourish crops; you
can nourish your animals.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.640
In science you cannot do.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:53.900
You have to play into the hands of organizations
who produce seeds for you, hybrid seeds.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:28:01.860
In Sahaja Yoga none hybrid seeds can be vibrated,
and you can get much more crops than you get

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:05.050
from these hybrid seeds.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:13.910
Then we eat those hybrid seeds, hybrid animals,
and our attention also becomes hybrid.

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:19.800
We are no more natural then.

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:32.520
How it is done is very simple because once
you are connected to the mains, for example,

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.810
this is connected to the mains and you can
hear Me.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:37.779
How it is done?

00:28:37.779 --> 00:28:38.930
Because it is built in.

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:42.830
It is built in within you, this power.

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:46.820
It acts and it works.

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:56.270
Only thing is that first of all this connection
has to be little bit fixed.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:29:01.050
Of course, you don’t have to pay for anything,
one thing for sure.

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:08.330
We have tried and tried and tried in this
country.

00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:13.279
And do you know that England is the heart
of the universe?

00:29:13.279 --> 00:29:15.170
Whatever happens here circulates.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:25.140
It’s a great responsibility on all the residents
of this country to understand what is their

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:35.320
work and they have to take to something which
is so important in these modern times.

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.940
Thank you very much.

00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:40.450
Tomorrow I hope to see you all.

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:45.770
Those who will be real honest seekers will
definitely come, I am sure, and bring your

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:47.060
friends and invite them.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:52.310
There is nothing more is to be given, nothing
higher to be given.

00:29:52.310 --> 00:30:03.470
It’s the highest where you get your peace,
joy, compassion and complete security.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:08.880
This is how you enter into the Kingdom of
God which has been promised.

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:13.490
All the promises are to be fulfilled.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:24.390
Please remember that to doubt is a very good
idea because that means you are free, but

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:34.470
to get Self-realization is the best because
you become absolutely a free person.

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:36.040
Nothing can dominate you.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:40.790
Real freedom is only after Self-realization.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:51.670
I hope all of you will respect yourself and
come tomorrow, and I am sure we will definitely

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:52.910
work it out.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:56.460
We can see these people coming from different
countries.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:59.210
They sing Sanskrit songs.

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:02.780
They haven’t sang today.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.650
Even the Indians can’t sing like that.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:11.710
Adi Shankaracharya has completely think that
they can sing, how can they?

00:31:11.710 --> 00:31:19.940
I mean, I had never known English people speaking
Indian language so easily.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:25.070
In olden days when they were there rahaj they
had for one sentence, you know you had to

00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:26.800
break your head with them.

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:37.330
If you have to say, “Open the door,” they
say ‒ they couldn’t say that; that is

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:42.710
Darwaja Khol Dey ‒ so they used to say,
“There was a cold day.”

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:46.300
In English they would say this, meaning Darwaja
Khol Dey.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:48.010
It was so difficult.

00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:52.200
But look at their tongues, what has happened
to them.

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:59.580
There are many musicians, artists who have
risen very high in life after coming to Sahaja

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:00.660
Yoga.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:07.820
So for all the artists, musicians it’s a
kind of a temptation I am giving but that’s

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.330
just a temptation.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:18.690
Actually you have [just] to achieve that supreme
position from where you can give it to others

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.520
and you are in power.

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:24.820
May God bless you all.
