00:00.001 --> 00:03.642
Public Program, Royal Albert Hall, London,
11 June 1992

01:36.936 --> 01:44.977
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

01:46.383 --> 01:55.060
At the very outset we have to know that truth
is what it is.

01:55.112 --> 01:59.812
We cannot change it.

01:59.812 --> 02:02.922
We cannot conceptualize it.

02:02.922 --> 02:05.451
We have to know it.

02:05.451 --> 02:14.351
For example, today science has become our
God.

02:14.351 --> 02:19.952
But you can’t know truth through science.

02:19.952 --> 02:34.802
It may solve some problems, one by one, but
it is not conclusive.

02:34.802 --> 02:40.082
It doesn’t reach you anywhere.

02:40.082 --> 02:46.544
It has created this problem, as you know,
the conference in New York from where the

02:46.544 --> 02:49.282
Goddess [sounds like a person’s name] has
come just now.

02:49.282 --> 02:53.731
[?] was telling Me the story that they don’t
know what to do, how to solve the problem.

02:53.731 --> 02:57.152
Then the violence.

02:57.152 --> 03:03.332
It cannot stop violence because it is amoral.

03:03.332 --> 03:04.792
It has no morality in it.

03:04.792 --> 03:09.962
It doesn’t tell you how to transcend.

03:09.962 --> 03:15.202
It doesn’t tell you that you are a spirit.

03:15.202 --> 03:24.091
He doesn’t know we can say it does not know
what the soul is.

03:24.091 --> 03:35.152
It does work out in a way, but I must say
Sahaja Yoga works out much faster, in a much

03:35.152 --> 03:36.341
simpler way.

03:36.341 --> 03:42.002
And if you take to Sahaja Yoga you’ll be
convinced, despite all your conditionings

03:42.002 --> 03:57.012
and cynicism, that Sahaja Yoga is the Meta
Science, is above science, above.

03:57.012 --> 04:08.182
With Sahaja Yoga, once you get your realization
automatically you get cured, automatically.

04:08.182 --> 04:15.982
This Kundalini which is your Mother, individual
Mother, She rises, passes through these centers

04:15.982 --> 04:23.672
and these centers are the basics within us
because when they are in your body you get

04:23.672 --> 04:29.092
all these troubles, sicknesses, cancer, all
kinds of incurable diseases, all kinds of

04:29.092 --> 04:34.563
mental troubles and spiritual problems due
to wrong seeking.

04:34.563 --> 04:44.342
I have seen people in England itself, so many
of them got rid of their drug addiction overnight

04:44.342 --> 04:47.071
with Kundalini awakening.

04:47.071 --> 04:51.342
It is their own power which has worked it
out.

04:51.342 --> 04:53.532
It does work.

04:53.532 --> 05:02.612
There are three doctors in Delhi University
who have got their MD in curing incurable

05:02.612 --> 05:04.702
diseases.

05:04.702 --> 05:16.612
We have people definitely suffering from all
kinds of problems of muscular disabilities

05:16.612 --> 05:24.722
or cancers of various types, even AIDS, I
would say.

05:24.722 --> 05:26.972
It has worked wonders with that.

05:26.972 --> 05:31.411
No doubt it works.

05:31.411 --> 05:32.521
How?

05:32.521 --> 05:38.602
There is another science beyond this science.

05:38.602 --> 05:43.791
There is another world beyond this world which
we do not know, about which all the saints

05:43.791 --> 05:44.791
have told us.

05:44.791 --> 05:51.792
The vision of that great life is described
by a great seer.

05:51.792 --> 05:59.302
We call it a [Brachta?], a great visionary,
William Blake of this country.

05:59.302 --> 06:05.692
He said the sleeping Albion, the sleeping
country, has to awake and arise.

06:05.692 --> 06:09.561
That was not imagination.

06:09.561 --> 06:14.452
That was his real penetration into the reality
which he described.

06:14.452 --> 06:17.422
But science cannot go into that dimension.

06:17.422 --> 06:31.262
That exists for all of us but we are so conditioned
that we cannot accept it that such a thing

06:31.262 --> 06:32.262
can exist.

06:32.262 --> 06:39.292
I don’t know when it started the deviation,
maybe Galileo’s invention of a telescope,

06:39.292 --> 06:40.292
maybe.

06:40.292 --> 06:50.552
I don’t know what happened that people started
giving up philosophy and taking to science,

06:50.552 --> 06:58.982
to economics, and now everything has become
nothing but economics and money, everything.

06:58.982 --> 07:09.852
You can’t find truth by paying.

07:09.852 --> 07:17.721
But one has to think there must be something
else; otherwise are we all going to be destroyed

07:17.721 --> 07:27.621
by these unlimited endeavors we have in all
kinds of destructive areas.

07:27.621 --> 07:31.542
Science was all right to begin with but it
has no limitation.

07:31.542 --> 07:38.932
It doesn’t keep to that point where now
we have started derailing into our destruction.

07:38.932 --> 07:44.412
Where have we gone wrong?

07:44.412 --> 07:45.811
We have no control.

07:45.811 --> 07:49.642
We have no discretion.

07:49.642 --> 07:54.132
So people turn, say, to religion.

07:54.132 --> 08:03.982
Now religion is also, as you know, is a farce
because it is also money-oriented or it is

08:03.982 --> 08:04.982
power-oriented.

08:04.982 --> 08:06.072
It is not at all spirit-oriented.

08:06.072 --> 08:07.392
No religion is now today.

08:07.392 --> 08:13.142
Take any religion, whether they like it or
not.

08:13.142 --> 08:25.422
Of course the prophets, the incarnations,
the seers, the saints, sages, all of them

08:25.422 --> 08:28.272
knew the truth.

08:28.272 --> 08:34.112
They were absolutely there where we have to
go.

08:34.112 --> 08:43.832
But later on people thought it is not reality;
what we discovered through science is reality.

08:43.832 --> 08:51.151
If it is so, why such problems are coming
to us?

08:51.151 --> 09:00.122
Why all our enterprises are boomeranging on
us?

09:00.122 --> 09:08.692
We don’t even realize that we are becoming
now slaves of this so-called modern scientific

09:08.692 --> 09:13.262
world.

09:13.262 --> 09:17.852
We can’t calculate two plus two.

09:17.852 --> 09:29.802
Also it’s very surprising that we do not
realize how we are playing into the hands

09:29.802 --> 09:34.392
of entrepreneurs.

09:34.392 --> 09:40.742
My granddaughters were with Me in Italy and
they wanted to buy some nice long skirts because

09:40.742 --> 09:44.862
they are still, you see, not so much sophisticated.

09:44.862 --> 09:52.322
And you’ll be surprised; no shop had any
skirts of that kind.

09:52.322 --> 09:59.172
They had now only of six inches and eight
inches because somebody, some mad person,

09:59.172 --> 10:05.232
must have taken out this idea in Paris and
we have to wear those dresses.

10:05.232 --> 10:07.162
Otherwise we are not in.

10:07.162 --> 10:09.272
People will laugh at us.

10:09.272 --> 10:10.622
If you wear long [Shri Mataji said “long”
but She meant to say “short”] dresses

10:10.622 --> 10:12.292
in this cold, imagine!

10:12.292 --> 10:14.022
Especially in England.

10:14.022 --> 10:17.432
What’s the sense in wearing these short
dresses?

10:17.432 --> 10:19.122
I can’t understand.

10:19.122 --> 10:30.102
I can understand in a place on the Equator
where it is so hot.

10:30.102 --> 10:42.192
Nonsensical inventions come out and we think,
“Oh, it’s great because it is new.”

10:42.192 --> 10:45.362
What are we going to do with these telescopes?

10:45.362 --> 10:47.316
What is the need to go to the moon?

10:47.341 --> 10:48.941
What did you achieve?

10:48.966 --> 10:51.906
Did you solve the problem of poverty in our
country?

10:51.906 --> 10:55.516
[She said first “in this” then corrected
“in our country”.]

10:55.516 --> 10:56.706
Wasted so much money.

10:56.706 --> 11:06.736
So there is an inborn force in all our adventures
which tries to bring us down, put us down.

11:06.736 --> 11:09.856
Now the psychological problem is another.

11:09.856 --> 11:15.195
That’s a force, inner force which is working
out and teaching us.

11:15.220 --> 11:17.236
Sickness is another.

11:17.236 --> 11:25.116
When you do things which are not natural,
go to the extremes, sickness comes in.

11:25.116 --> 11:29.126
There is no discretion.

11:29.126 --> 11:30.846
There is no direction.

11:30.846 --> 11:34.235
We do not know what is our future is.

11:34.489 --> 11:37.589
Now science has discovered DNA.

11:37.589 --> 11:41.059
Of course, scientist are quite shocked by
that.

11:41.059 --> 11:43.459
It’s a big question mark for them.

11:43.459 --> 11:45.699
But they’ll go to DNA.

11:45.699 --> 11:49.479
They’ll try to find out what was the origin
of man.

11:49.479 --> 11:51.339
What is the need to know the origin of man?

11:51.339 --> 11:55.469
We should know the future of man now.

11:55.469 --> 12:00.039
If you know what is the origin, what are you
going to gain out of that?

12:00.039 --> 12:01.279
Have you to become now animals?

12:01.279 --> 12:06.189
Or have you to become something higher?

12:06.189 --> 12:22.719
In this great country of England there have
been great seers who have talked about, who

12:22.719 --> 12:33.759
have wrote about the great visions they had
about the English, the Wales, the Scots.

12:33.759 --> 12:42.559
But they were considered as mad people because
our conditionings are such that we don’t

12:42.559 --> 12:47.729
think it is mad to become punk or to become
a hippy.

12:47.729 --> 12:49.892
We don’t think that way.

12:50.098 --> 12:54.259
The other day I saw a gentleman with big holes
in his pant.

12:54.394 --> 12:56.819
I asked him, “What’s this going on?”

12:56.819 --> 12:58.889
He said, “It’s a holey pant.”

12:58.889 --> 13:00.959
[Indian words sounds like jailwai]”.

13:00.959 --> 13:09.249
And I said, “But mister, this holey pant
will give you some sort of trouble because

13:09.249 --> 13:12.649
it’s a very cold country.”

13:12.649 --> 13:15.089
“No, we are having a holey pant.”

13:15.089 --> 13:22.139
To dress up funny, to make your hair in a
funny way, is that’s the way you are going

13:22.139 --> 13:26.729
to change yourself inside?

13:26.729 --> 13:28.189
What is the reason?

13:28.189 --> 13:31.909
Why we cannot solve our ecological problem?

13:31.909 --> 13:37.489
Is the human being, he has to transform himself.

13:37.489 --> 13:44.549
And when he is transformed, the first thing
which happens to him that he becomes collectively

13:44.549 --> 13:45.689
conscious.

13:45.689 --> 13:53.449
You start feeling others on your fingertips,
you can feel others their centers, you can

13:53.449 --> 14:00.019
feel others, and an upsurge of compassion,
upsurge.

14:00.019 --> 14:15.649
I went to Russia and I was surprised in Russia
that so many Germans, Germans Sahaja yogis

14:15.649 --> 14:17.959
flew to help Me out.

14:17.959 --> 14:21.302
So surprised at them.

14:21.846 --> 14:23.376
I said, “You’re given up your jobs or
something?”

14:23.401 --> 14:25.392
They said, “No, we are taking a leave and
come.”

14:25.417 --> 14:26.417
I said, “Why?”

14:27.067 --> 14:29.681
“Mother, don’t you think it is our responsibility?

14:29.705 --> 14:33.456
What our forefathers have done we have to
rectify.

14:33.481 --> 14:37.220
We have to help them.”

14:37.220 --> 14:43.580
We talk of democracy, this liberal democracy.

14:43.580 --> 14:53.240
Churchill himself has said that is the worst
type of government is democratic, but I don’t

14:53.240 --> 15:01.170
know anything of better; so better have it.

15:01.170 --> 15:06.121
All these things make you abnormal when you
have so many choices.

15:06.121 --> 15:11.670
Choices of what?

15:11.695 --> 15:18.790
Choices of clothes, choices of food, choices
of these stones and ashes.

15:18.790 --> 15:25.142
What about the choice of our future life?

15:25.205 --> 15:28.229
What about the progeny that is going to come?

15:28.254 --> 15:30.425
What are we going to give them?

15:30.450 --> 15:32.814
Plastics?

15:35.322 --> 15:45.045
Then some people intelligent, you have to
have superior type of intelligence.

15:45.070 --> 15:48.189
Think about it.

15:48.214 --> 15:52.000
There must be some solution; so they become
seekers.

15:52.000 --> 16:03.240
William Blake has said, he called them men
of God, and they will seek and they will become

16:03.240 --> 16:06.300
Divine and they’ll make others Divine.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.880
He has prophesized it.

16:07.880 --> 16:15.740
All his prophecies can be absolutely executed,
can be manifested in this great country of

16:15.740 --> 16:17.370
Great Britain.

16:17.370 --> 16:23.690
But first we should get out of our conditionings.

16:23.690 --> 16:38.360
The first conditioning is that anything which
comes from East is stupid, while anything

16:38.360 --> 16:42.220
that comes from West is the best.

16:42.220 --> 16:45.450
Of course, one has to learn about science.

16:45.450 --> 16:47.010
One has to learn about so many things.

16:47.010 --> 16:50.270
There are so many good things about West.

16:50.270 --> 16:57.300
But if in the East there is something good,
after all we human beings only separate East,

16:57.300 --> 17:02.480
West, North, South, Black, White, this, that.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.710
God does not.

17:04.710 --> 17:09.490
So if there is something that is going to
nourish our roots, whether it comes from East,

17:09.490 --> 17:13.340
North, South, anywhere, why not take it?

17:13.340 --> 17:17.410
Whatever is good for our benevolence, why
not accept it?

17:17.410 --> 17:18.900
All right.

17:18.900 --> 17:24.590
Then people came out with these ideas, and
I am sorry to say from our India lots of horrible

17:24.590 --> 17:30.135
people were exported.

17:30.160 --> 17:34.790
And thousands and thousands joined these hypocritical
people.

17:34.790 --> 17:39.340
But for Sahaja Yoga, no.

17:39.340 --> 17:43.900
Because what is the basic difference in Sahaja
Yoga and any other nonsensical thing like

17:43.900 --> 17:46.890
that is that here you cannot pay.

17:46.890 --> 17:52.450
You have to become.

17:52.450 --> 17:55.330
What is important is what you become.

17:55.330 --> 17:57.260
You cannot become a member of Sahaja Yoga.

17:57.260 --> 17:58.260
You cannot.

17:58.260 --> 18:04.250
We do not have any organization like that.

18:04.250 --> 18:11.730
You have to become yourself ,and there is
divinity all within yourself.

18:11.730 --> 18:16.550
I verily say to you that, “Don’t condemn
yourself.”

18:16.550 --> 18:19.220
By no means.

18:19.220 --> 18:31.390
You are at the epitome of evolution, and what
you have to get is just humble down and see

18:31.390 --> 18:34.910
for yourself that in your heart resides the
spirit.

18:34.910 --> 18:42.300
And you have all the divinity, all the powers
which are above this science.

18:42.300 --> 18:49.220
For a diagnosis of a person, they will kill
that person with that diagnosis in the medical

18:49.220 --> 18:50.220
profession.

18:50.220 --> 18:57.760
But in Sahaja Yoga anybody can tell you what’s
wrong with you on the fingertips.

18:57.760 --> 19:01.850
It’s a fact.

19:01.850 --> 19:05.950
It’s the truth.

19:05.950 --> 19:12.200
But how many years it’s going to take for
people to accept the truth?

19:12.200 --> 19:19.070
As it is I’ve been here for eighteen years;
no, this is the nineteen year I am here.

19:19.070 --> 19:27.190
Whatever one may say what Marx has done, Marxism,
one has to ask question.

19:27.190 --> 19:33.120
He could have been right in some ways, and
when I went to Russia I did feel that one

19:33.120 --> 19:38.910
thing he did was take out the attention of
people from materialism.

19:38.910 --> 19:40.970
It’s a fact.

19:40.970 --> 19:47.280
We always had sixteen thousand, twenty thousand
people and in one place called [Togliati]

19:47.280 --> 19:51.640
there are twenty thousand Sahaja Yogis practicing
Sahaja Yoga.

19:51.640 --> 20:00.670
One day this Russia will be the greatest country,
if not India.

20:00.670 --> 20:05.520
If we have lost our soul, if we have lost
our connection with that Divine Power which

20:05.520 --> 20:11.200
is the Power of God Almighty, then what are
we going to be left with?

20:11.200 --> 20:13.610
What are we going to win?

20:13.610 --> 20:15.850
Drug addicts?

20:15.850 --> 20:16.970
AIDS?

20:16.970 --> 20:18.090
Homosexual?

20:18.090 --> 20:20.330
This nonsense?

20:20.330 --> 20:22.570
That nonsense?

20:22.570 --> 20:25.906
We should have our self-esteem.

20:25.961 --> 20:31.890
We must know that God has not created us to
be wasted like this.

20:31.890 --> 20:38.770
It’s the first time I allowed them to show
some of these pictures because I know the

20:38.770 --> 20:43.230
mind here is so clever that they can cheat
themselves.

20:43.230 --> 20:48.200
They start saying, “Oh, this must be arranged.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.200
This must be organized.”

20:49.200 --> 20:53.370
For what should we arrange and organize logically?

20:53.370 --> 20:54.610
We are well-off people.

20:54.610 --> 20:58.920
We have nothing to gain from you.

20:58.920 --> 21:04.840
We don’t need any money.

21:04.840 --> 21:12.830
The people now who have come to Sahaja Yoga
are angelic people; you’ll be surprised.

21:12.830 --> 21:18.560
We have no difference of races, no difference
of religion, no difference of nationality

21:18.560 --> 21:22.830
and all these things that create problems.

21:22.830 --> 21:29.430
We believe in all the prophets and all the
religions but we do not hate any religion.

21:29.430 --> 21:31.810
We are not fundamentalist.

21:31.810 --> 21:37.270
That’s why all the fundamentalists are angry
with us, because how dare you love all the

21:37.270 --> 21:40.420
religions, because they are all one.

21:40.420 --> 21:45.000
Fundamentally they are one, which you can
understand once you get your realization.

21:45.000 --> 21:52.570
After realization you can feel the truth on
your fingertips and you can find out all these

21:52.570 --> 21:54.070
people who they were.

21:54.070 --> 22:02.010
Christ Himself has said, “Those who are
not against Me, are with Me.”

22:02.010 --> 22:03.331
Who are those?

22:03.331 --> 22:08.001
All this fundamentalism has created a problem
today and that is the greatest problem, as

22:08.001 --> 22:16.410
good as ecological problem, I think.

22:16.410 --> 22:23.250
We have people from all the religions, as
I told you, and the compassion and love that

22:23.250 --> 22:24.630
they have.

22:24.630 --> 22:33.460
I’ve never seen them fighting, quarrelling,
hitting, violent, abusing.

22:33.460 --> 22:41.000
Such decent, beautiful citizen they have become.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.920
Honest.

22:43.920 --> 22:48.000
We all have to be like that.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.410
Only thing you must know your own powers.

22:50.410 --> 22:53.860
You must know what you are.

22:53.860 --> 22:58.100
And the truth is that you are the spirit.

22:58.100 --> 23:02.020
You are not this body, not this mind.

23:02.020 --> 23:04.520
You are the spirit which you have to become.

23:04.520 --> 23:11.420
And the another truth is that there is an
All-pervading Power which you may call by

23:11.420 --> 23:17.980
any name, like “Ruh”, like the All-pervading
Power of Divine Love, or Brahmachaitanya.

23:17.980 --> 23:21.890
Call by any name, it’s there.

23:21.890 --> 23:24.270
You have to just get connected with it.

23:24.270 --> 23:27.080
All the powers start flowing through you.

23:27.080 --> 23:35.460
Do you mean to say that all these great saints
and incarnations and prophets were telling

23:35.460 --> 23:38.350
us lies?

23:38.350 --> 23:52.290
But not just reading their books, not by reciting
their names, not by being fundamentalist;

23:52.290 --> 24:01.620
but by becoming a realized soul that you understand
every one of them.

24:01.620 --> 24:10.950
You integrate within yourself and without.

24:10.950 --> 24:23.390
Tomorrow I am going to tell you what the spirit
works out in you when you get your Self-realization,

24:23.390 --> 24:26.420
and also we’ll have a session of Self-realization.

24:26.420 --> 24:28.700
Today not, tomorrow.

24:28.700 --> 24:38.160
First, you just don’t be thinking about
it, arguing about it.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.160
You cannot argue.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.350
It is beyond your mind.

24:41.350 --> 24:49.330
And it is not Aristotle did say that there
is a world beyond the moon and one below the

24:49.330 --> 24:50.330
moon.

24:50.330 --> 24:51.330
We live in the below the moon.

24:51.330 --> 24:55.730
But there is another world beyond which we
have to know.

24:55.730 --> 24:59.440
All of you have the right to know.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.610
And Sahaja means born with you.

25:01.610 --> 25:06.110
Is the right to get union with that All-pervading
Power.

25:06.110 --> 25:10.050
Is your birthright and you all can have it.

25:10.050 --> 25:14.720
So why not have it?

25:14.720 --> 25:19.230
Of course, there are many fundamentalists
who may write against us, because they think

25:19.230 --> 25:21.670
we go against them.

25:21.670 --> 25:24.120
It’s not a fact.

25:24.120 --> 25:29.050
They do not want you to change.

25:29.050 --> 25:35.690
They want you to belong to their clubs by
which they could fight, denounce others.

25:35.690 --> 25:42.060
The whole world is created by One God.

25:42.060 --> 25:46.120
How can we fight in the name of God?

25:46.120 --> 25:47.120
Not only fighting.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.210
They are doing all kind of things.

25:48.210 --> 25:50.190
You know that.

25:50.190 --> 25:54.190
All kinds of horrible things they are doing
in the name of God.

25:54.190 --> 25:57.920
But after realization, we don’t have to
tell you anything.

25:57.920 --> 26:01.860
You just do what is righteous.

26:01.860 --> 26:09.150
You become that kind of a personality, so
powerful as that, I assure you.

26:09.150 --> 26:13.350
Tomorrow, please, all of you come along again.

26:13.350 --> 26:15.690
Today there was a bomb scare.

26:15.690 --> 26:16.690
Imagine!

26:16.690 --> 26:20.250
What a stupid thing people are doing wasting
their life.

26:20.250 --> 26:25.060
For what did you come on this earth?

26:25.060 --> 26:29.870
To create bombs, scare, kill people, murder
someone?

26:29.870 --> 26:34.680
I mean, they are worse than animals sometimes.

26:34.680 --> 26:38.290
Tomorrow call also your friends, everyone.

26:38.290 --> 26:44.640
First time in England we have spoken so openly
about Sahaja Yoga, because they always said,

26:44.640 --> 26:50.040
“Mother ,if You say something very openly,
they will never understand.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.040
You should not tell them.

26:51.040 --> 26:58.960
You should try to pamper their ego all the
time and should not say much about Sahaja

26:58.960 --> 26:59.960
Yoga.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.380
Let them get their realization.”

27:01.380 --> 27:07.480
And you will be surprised; the reaction was
that we may have people about, say, three

27:07.480 --> 27:11.000
hundred, four hundred, out of which two would
come to the program.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.960
Even Indians here are, I must say.

27:15.960 --> 27:16.960
Not in India.

27:16.960 --> 27:21.970
In India thousands, thousands have taken to
Sahaja Yoga, thousands.

27:21.970 --> 27:29.070
It is their heritage, but they have also lost
their heritage and they are doing such a tremendous

27:29.070 --> 27:30.900
work.

27:30.900 --> 27:38.730
With Sahaja Yoga you can nourish crops; you
can nourish your animals.

27:38.730 --> 27:41.640
In science you cannot do.

27:41.640 --> 27:53.900
You have to play into the hands of organizations
who produce seeds for you, hybrid seeds.

27:53.900 --> 28:01.860
In Sahaja Yoga none hybrid seeds can be vibrated,
and you can get much more crops than you get

28:01.860 --> 28:05.050
from these hybrid seeds.

28:05.050 --> 28:13.910
Then we eat those hybrid seeds, hybrid animals,
and our attention also becomes hybrid.

28:13.910 --> 28:19.800
We are no more natural then.

28:19.800 --> 28:32.520
How it is done is very simple because once
you are connected to the mains, for example,

28:32.520 --> 28:35.810
this is connected to the mains and you can
hear Me.

28:35.810 --> 28:37.779
How it is done?

28:37.779 --> 28:38.930
Because it is built in.

28:38.930 --> 28:42.830
It is built in within you, this power.

28:42.830 --> 28:46.820
It acts and it works.

28:46.820 --> 28:56.270
Only thing is that first of all this connection
has to be little bit fixed.

28:56.270 --> 29:01.050
Of course, you don’t have to pay for anything,
one thing for sure.

29:01.050 --> 29:08.330
We have tried and tried and tried in this
country.

29:08.330 --> 29:13.279
And do you know that England is the heart
of the universe?

29:13.279 --> 29:15.170
Whatever happens here circulates.

29:15.170 --> 29:25.140
It’s a great responsibility on all the residents
of this country to understand what is their

29:25.140 --> 29:35.320
work and they have to take to something which
is so important in these modern times.

29:35.320 --> 29:38.940
Thank you very much.

29:38.940 --> 29:40.450
Tomorrow I hope to see you all.

29:40.450 --> 29:45.770
Those who will be real honest seekers will
definitely come, I am sure, and bring your

29:45.770 --> 29:47.060
friends and invite them.

29:47.060 --> 29:52.310
There is nothing more is to be given, nothing
higher to be given.

29:52.310 --> 30:03.470
It’s the highest where you get your peace,
joy, compassion and complete security.

30:03.470 --> 30:08.880
This is how you enter into the Kingdom of
God which has been promised.

30:08.880 --> 30:13.490
All the promises are to be fulfilled.

30:13.490 --> 30:24.390
Please remember that to doubt is a very good
idea because that means you are free, but

30:24.390 --> 30:34.470
to get Self-realization is the best because
you become absolutely a free person.

30:34.470 --> 30:36.040
Nothing can dominate you.

30:36.040 --> 30:40.790
Real freedom is only after Self-realization.

30:40.790 --> 30:51.670
I hope all of you will respect yourself and
come tomorrow, and I am sure we will definitely

30:51.670 --> 30:52.910
work it out.

30:52.910 --> 30:56.460
We can see these people coming from different
countries.

30:56.460 --> 30:59.210
They sing Sanskrit songs.

30:59.210 --> 31:02.780
They haven’t sang today.

31:02.780 --> 31:04.650
Even the Indians can’t sing like that.

31:04.650 --> 31:11.710
Adi Shankaracharya has completely think that
they can sing, how can they?

31:11.710 --> 31:19.940
I mean, I had never known English people speaking
Indian language so easily.

31:19.940 --> 31:25.070
In olden days when they were there rahaj they
had for one sentence, you know you had to

31:25.070 --> 31:26.800
break your head with them.

31:26.800 --> 31:37.330
If you have to say, “Open the door,” they
say ‒ they couldn’t say that; that is

31:37.330 --> 31:42.710
Darwaja Khol Dey ‒ so they used to say,
“There was a cold day.”

31:42.710 --> 31:46.300
In English they would say this, meaning Darwaja
Khol Dey.

31:46.300 --> 31:48.010
It was so difficult.

31:48.010 --> 31:52.200
But look at their tongues, what has happened
to them.

31:52.200 --> 31:59.580
There are many musicians, artists who have
risen very high in life after coming to Sahaja

31:59.580 --> 32:00.660
Yoga.

32:00.660 --> 32:07.820
So for all the artists, musicians it’s a
kind of a temptation I am giving but that’s

32:07.820 --> 32:09.330
just a temptation.

32:09.330 --> 32:18.690
Actually you have [just] to achieve that supreme
position from where you can give it to others

32:18.690 --> 32:20.520
and you are in power.

32:20.520 --> 32:24.820
May God bless you all.
