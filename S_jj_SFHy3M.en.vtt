00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:15.829
[Music]

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.829
[Applause]

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.810
my idea of coming to conduct me for

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.380
Shibuya

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:35.820
was this that Shiva represents the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:39.350
spirit and the spirit is residing in all

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.350
of you in your hearts

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:55.470
the seat of Sadashiva is on top of your

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:55.470
head but is reflected in your heart

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.700
now your brain is the bitter

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:16.720
so to bring spirit to your brain means

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.720
enlightenment of your brain

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:28.439
enlightenment of your brain means the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:38.700
limited capacity of your brain has to

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:40.950
become unlimited in its capacity to

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.880
realize God we I will not use the word

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:51.740
understand to realize God how powerful

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.740
is how miraculous is how greatly

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:06.520
the another is that the brain of man can

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.520
create of course out of the dead

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:14.950
but when T Spirit comes into brain

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:26.860
then you create living things living

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.860
work of Kundalini

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:39.180
even the dead start behaving like living

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:42.180
because you touch the spirit in the dead

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.180
like

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:56.370
the nucleus inside every atom or a

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:02.400
molecule has the spirit of that molecule

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:06.739
and if you become useful we can say the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.739
brain of

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:16.250
a molecule or an atom is like the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.410
nucleus body of the nucleus but the one

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.250
that controls a nucleus is the spirit

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:27.550
that resides within the nucleus so now

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.550
you have got the attention of the body

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:37.190
the whole body of the atom then the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.640
nucleus and inside the nucleus is the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.480
spirit in the same way we have this body

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:56.860
the attention of the body

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:56.860
and then we have the we have

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.960
the nucleus

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.110
is the brain

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:20.690
and the Spirit is in the heart so the

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.690
brain is controlled through the spirit

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:33.710
how that around the heart there are

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.710
seven auras

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:49.520
which can be multiplied into any number

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:52.520
seven raised to power 1600 which are

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.520
once

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.610
which

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:02.610
much

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.759
the seven chakras needs to power 16 and

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.759
eight

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.430
16000 sorry

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:18.820
now this

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.820
spirit is watching through this aura

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:30.550
watching I'm again Singh watching

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.550
through this aura this aura is watching

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:40.580
the behavior of your seven centers in

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:44.330
your brain is also watching all the

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:49.070
nerves that are working into being

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:51.700
watching again but when you bring the

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.700
spirit

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:04.520
into your brain then you go to step side

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.110
because when you have CUDA linearizes

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:22.800
she catches the Sadashiva and Sadashiva

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:27.570
informs the spirit informs the self

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:34.490
reflects in the spirit so that's the

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:34.490
first state where the watching or us

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:49.640
start communicating through your

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:54.900
different chakras in the brain and

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:59.550
integrating it but when you bring your

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:01.820
spirit to your brain this is the second

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.820
state

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:12.220
then you really become self-realized in

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:18.340
the food in the food because then your

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:24.940
scent that is the spirit becomes your

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:29.440
brain action is very dynamic

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:36.400
it opens then the fifth dimension in the

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:39.009
human being first when you become

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.639
realized collectively conscious and

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:47.530
start raising the Kundalini you are in

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:53.259
you cross the fourth dimension when your

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:56.229
spirit comes into your brain then you

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:58.919
become the fifth dimension means you

00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:58.919
become the doer

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:08.730
our brain now for example says alright

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:12.210
lift this thing up when you touch it

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:16.650
with your hands you lift it you have the

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:22.740
door but when the brain becomes the

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:32.420
spirit the Spirit is the world and when

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:32.420
spirit is the doer then you become

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:39.180
a complete Shiva self-realized

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:50.380
in that state if you get angry you are

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.380
not attached

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:57.889
you are not an attached person to

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:59.930
anything what sir if you possess

00:08:57.889 --> 00:09:03.910
anything you are not attached

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:11.870
you cannot attach because Felicity - not

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:15.230
completely you don't bother about any

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:17.889
attachments whatsoever even for a second

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.889
you are not attached

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:29.220
now I would say to understand the

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:34.710
detachment of spirit we should study

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:40.890
ourselves very well clearly how are we

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:46.020
attached we are attached firstly by our

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:48.650
brain mostly by our brain because all

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:54.800
our conditionings are in the our brain

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:54.800
and all over ego is also in our place

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:07.470
so all emotional attachments are through

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:11.240
our brain and all our egoistical

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.240
attachments also are through our brain

00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:18.210
that's why it is said that after

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:23.150
realization one must try to practice the

00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:25.710
Shiva tattva by practicing detachment

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:30.600
now you just watch your attention where

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:33.630
is it one watches as soon as you start

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:35.400
watching yourself your attention you

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:37.530
will become more identified with your

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.000
spirit because if you have to watch your

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:42.110
attention you have to be your strength

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.110
otherwise how will you watch it

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:52.130
the detachment is to be watched and seen

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:52.130
through your own attachments

00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:00.649
now because you are realized Souls not

00:10:59.089 --> 00:11:02.689
yet the spirit has not come into your

00:11:00.649 --> 00:11:05.509
brain of course but still you're

00:11:02.689 --> 00:11:09.709
realized Souls so what you have you can

00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:15.049
do is at least to watch your attention

00:11:09.709 --> 00:11:22.549
you can do that you can watch your

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:25.839
attention very clearly by seeing where

00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:25.839
your attention is way

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:35.480
and then controlling your attention also

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:35.480
isn't very simple

00:11:37.439 --> 00:11:45.929
to control your attention you have to

00:11:42.149 --> 00:11:52.559
just remove your attention from this to

00:11:45.929 --> 00:11:57.239
that try to change your priorities all

00:11:52.559 --> 00:12:04.279
this has to be done now so the spirit is

00:11:57.239 --> 00:12:04.279
like the ocean which has the light in it

00:12:04.369 --> 00:12:14.789
and when this ocean pours into the

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:18.269
little cup of your brain the cup loses

00:12:14.789 --> 00:12:22.619
its identity and everything becomes

00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:25.679
virtually everything so it's the ocean

00:12:22.619 --> 00:12:32.129
that is the spirit well your brain is

00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:36.449
limited so the detachment from your

00:12:32.129 --> 00:12:39.209
limited brain has to be brought in all

00:12:36.449 --> 00:12:42.989
limitations of brain should be broken so

00:12:39.209 --> 00:12:47.119
that when this ocean fills that brain

00:12:42.989 --> 00:12:47.119
will break that

00:12:48.339 --> 00:12:56.800
little captain and every bit of that Cup

00:12:55.029 --> 00:13:00.699
she'll become colorful the whole

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:04.240
atmosphere everything whatever relocate

00:13:00.699 --> 00:13:06.999
should be colorful color of the spirit

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:10.300
with her life to the spirit and this

00:13:06.999 --> 00:13:13.499
light of the Spirit acts works thinks

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:15.579
coordinates does everything

00:13:13.499 --> 00:13:20.170
this is the reason today

00:13:15.579 --> 00:13:22.379
I decided to bring Shiva tattva to the

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.379
blade

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:28.070
the first procedure is to take your

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:32.770
brain towards the shooter by telling it

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:35.090
see where are you going mr. brain

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:38.090
putting attention to this reporting

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:41.120
attention to that getting involved on

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:46.520
detach become the brain yourself only

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:49.310
the brain detach and then take this

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:52.730
detached brain completely filled with

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:56.870
the color of the spirit it will

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:59.420
automatically happen so today I hope we

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:06.860
all pray that O Lord give us strength

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:09.080
and that source of attraction by which

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.990
we give up all the refractions of all

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:14.150
the pleasures of joy of ego of

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:17.270
everything that we think of but we

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:23.570
should fall into the pure joy form of

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:26.680
the sheer thought oh absolutely

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.680
you got richer

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:35.940
