00:00:00.011 --> 00:00:01.412
Seminar in Mill Farm – Sherborne, Dorset (UK), 2 August 1981.

00:00:01.474 --> 00:00:05.532
In Mahalakshmi’ s temple, which is a real temple,

00:00:05.532 --> 00:00:08.297
where all the three deities have come out in Bombay

00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:11.430
where I used to live very close to that place,

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.118
just imagine, and this is very common.

00:00:16.118 --> 00:00:20.962
So to understand how human beings reacted to that

00:00:21.063 --> 00:00:23.690
is very well shown in Delphi.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.859
It’s a beautiful thing is so done.

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:30.315
But I was amazed at the Temple of Athena when we went there.

00:00:30.315 --> 00:00:33.643
It’s so much so near to the thing that

00:00:33.643 --> 00:00:38.299
the Mooladhara is shown there where the Kundalini exists.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.682
Now She is the one who has snakes around Her, see?

00:00:41.682 --> 00:00:45.002
And She has little, little snakes as Her children. Can you imagine?

00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:48.438
And She is one, and She has a daughter,

00:00:48.438 --> 00:00:54.833
which is the Kundalini in you and a God who is a child God.

00:00:55.331 --> 00:00:58.341
And when She stands She has a Kundalini in her hand,

00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:02.116
the snake coming out of Her hand. With all the charkas, she is made.

00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:04.529
It’s so beautifully shown.

00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:07.754
The best was Her Sanctum Sanctorum

00:01:07.754 --> 00:01:10.846
where nobody is allowed to go inside where She resides,

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:13.243
is the Adi Kundalini.

00:01:13.275 --> 00:01:21.513
But they say that She came out of the head of Zeus,

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:26.874
the Primordial Kundalini. And Her place nobody can go inside,

00:01:26.874 --> 00:01:31.133
nobody can reach except for Her son, the child son.

00:01:31.334 --> 00:01:34.477
But Her,

00:01:34.477 --> 00:01:37.914
Her steps are very large

00:01:37.914 --> 00:01:41.842
also are roundish. She curved. Can you imagine?

00:01:41.842 --> 00:01:45.876
They’re curved as if part of the Kundalas they are.

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:53.566
And they are 3 ½ in height,

00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:57.602
you can see that, in height and in width also.

00:01:57.602 --> 00:02:00.491
Like every place is made of big,

00:02:00.692 --> 00:02:03.825
I mean the three are made of big stones and the last one

00:02:03.825 --> 00:02:08.188
is made of the small, three and a half, and they go in a curve.

00:02:08.188 --> 00:02:13.553
And that is Sanctum Sanctorum nobody can go inside.

00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:18.991
Now what an expression it was. This was the early Expression

00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:22.586
and Athens is after Her name Athena.

00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:26.715
If you see the face also you will find your Mother very much there.

00:02:26.715 --> 00:02:29.532
I’ve got the photographs and all that which I will show you later on.

00:02:29.532 --> 00:02:32.747
But what I’m saying the Mother Earth has done Her job.

00:02:32.747 --> 00:02:39.548
People have done their job. Christ or we can say Mohammed

00:02:39.548 --> 00:02:45.207
or Buddha, Kabira, anyone of them;

00:02:45.207 --> 00:02:49.219
they have done their jobs, alright. They have worked for you.

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.743
They have created places within you. They have done their job.

00:02:52.743 --> 00:02:58.460
Now it is you who are on the stage, not Me.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.769
Sahastrara has to work it out.

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.928
And Sahastrara always surrounds the heart.

00:03:10.531 --> 00:03:16.666
You are enlightened by your Spirit, which resides in your heart.

00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:24.033
And the whole Sahastrara’s mandalas are around the heart.

00:03:27.498 --> 00:03:35.871
So as you are now the temple of that Spirit,

00:03:35.871 --> 00:03:38.589
you are the heart.

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:42.454
You have to be very, very assiduous.

00:03:42.454 --> 00:03:48.542
This is the fourth point, which is again against all Englishmen.

00:03:49.684 --> 00:03:52.827
They are holidaying permanently.

00:03:52.827 --> 00:03:56.073
The whole attention is in holidays.

00:03:56.073 --> 00:04:00.906
At the slightest pretext, they are on a holiday.

00:04:01.597 --> 00:04:06.946
The word holiday comes from the word holy day,

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.231
is to do something holy on that day.

00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:19.028
God took his leave from the whole world for one day

00:04:19.028 --> 00:04:21.782
to cleanse Himself and to be in a holy condition.

00:04:21.983 --> 00:04:24.274
Because you see when you clear other people,

00:04:24.274 --> 00:04:27.520
when you create something,

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.987
then you want to have some time to yourself and to enjoy yourself.

00:04:31.987 --> 00:04:34.566
That’s why He got this holiday.

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:41.182
Here it is permanent holiday not holy day, holly means hollow.

00:04:41.182 --> 00:04:43.682
It’s hollow day.

00:04:43.682 --> 00:04:47.055
And this madness of holiday

00:04:47.055 --> 00:04:52.173
is of course I am working out on my level to cut it down.

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:59.452
This is the time one has to really get into Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:59.452 --> 00:05:06.524
to work hard, is the time to give up all your lethargies.

00:05:09.785 --> 00:05:14.277
You have to get out of your sleep.

00:05:14.277 --> 00:05:17.301
I have seen people – I’ve told, she asked Me that,

00:05:17.301 --> 00:05:19.704
“Mother we would like to have your puja”. I said, “I know

00:05:19.704 --> 00:05:24.157
why you want to have puja is good because puja means flooding.”

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:29.101
The floods come in, ah everybody feels fine.

00:05:29.101 --> 00:05:33.117
Some feel fine for a month, some for a week,

00:05:33.117 --> 00:05:35.871
some for a day, some for an hour.

00:05:35.871 --> 00:05:39.879
Again, as it is.

00:05:45.593 --> 00:05:50.822
Because with flooding

00:05:50.822 --> 00:05:54.108
you feel the water has come inside.

00:05:54.108 --> 00:05:58.036
But it should be needed; there should be some depth.

00:05:58.036 --> 00:06:04.298
That is not done. Every Sahaja Yogi must do it every day,

00:06:04.298 --> 00:06:07.986
is a part of his life.

00:06:07.986 --> 00:06:12.740
Cleansing is a part of his life. Is just like brushing his teeth.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.431
Even if he does not brush his teeth does not matter.

00:06:17.652 --> 00:06:22.723
I do not brush My teeth every night. You might have noticed it.

00:06:22.723 --> 00:06:27.921
I need not brush. My teeth are still solid and I was asking My husband,

00:06:28.122 --> 00:06:31.596
“When do the human beings lose their teeth?”

00:06:31.596 --> 00:06:36.168
He said, “You have already passed that age.”

00:06:36.168 --> 00:06:39.597
I said, “That means I will never lose My teeth?”

00:06:39.597 --> 00:06:43.060
He said, “May not.” But I never brush My teeth in the night

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.869
before sleeping as you people religiously do.

00:06:49.655 --> 00:06:53.143
The most important thing is cleansing yourself every night.

00:06:53.143 --> 00:06:58.096
Whether you cleanse it with water or rub it yourself with salt

00:06:58.096 --> 00:07:07.015
or with butter or you do the tratrika, with the flame,

00:07:07.015 --> 00:07:09.229
do what you like

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:12.825
but you have to pay attention to your cleansing every night.

00:07:12.825 --> 00:07:17.011
And morning time you have to surrender

00:07:17.011 --> 00:07:19.210
before doing anything else.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:24.409
You have to get up early? All right get up early.

00:07:27.067 --> 00:07:31.393
Do what you like but you have to work hard.

00:07:31.956 --> 00:07:38.482
And you have to think every day what have I done for Sahaja Yoga today?

00:07:43.482 --> 00:07:46.869
It’s not the same cycle we are going to start you see.

00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:51.115
Once you have denied materialism you became hippies,

00:07:51.115 --> 00:07:54.072
now after coming out of that we are not going to start

00:07:54.072 --> 00:07:58.163
the same cycle of materialism.

00:08:01.296 --> 00:08:05.812
This is a new way where we have to go,

00:08:05.812 --> 00:08:09.375
where we understand our detachments from things.

00:08:09.375 --> 00:08:12.625
It’s all right.

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:15.070
We are not going to run away from matter

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.308
but we are going to master it. If we get it well and good

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:20.816
if we don’t get it well and good, it’s just the same,

00:08:20.816 --> 00:08:24.554
makes no difference.

00:08:28.184 --> 00:08:31.613
And hard work is needed now, real hard work I tell you

00:08:31.613 --> 00:08:33.581
because now I’m going to America.

00:08:33.581 --> 00:08:36.351
When I am there, there is so much of lethargy;

00:08:36.351 --> 00:08:41.296
when I don’t allow you to sleep after 6 o’clock even if you try.

00:08:41.296 --> 00:08:44.280
I’ve done that if you notice,

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:49.202
rather difficult for people to sleep after six.

00:08:49.202 --> 00:08:54.090
But, still,

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.067
when I go away you have to really work very hard

00:08:57.067 --> 00:08:59.661
and keep yourself clean every day

00:08:59.661 --> 00:09:02.677
and write it down on a piece of paper.

00:09:02.677 --> 00:09:07.344
By the time I come back again I find all my horses.

00:09:08.336 --> 00:09:11.814
That’s not going to be this time.

00:09:11.814 --> 00:09:14.544
Today you have to promise Me that,

00:09:14.544 --> 00:09:17.346
that all of you are going to work very hard,

00:09:17.346 --> 00:09:20.954
cleanse yourself completely. Go all out.

00:09:20.954 --> 00:09:25.660
After all, this country is not so big to travel.

00:09:26.605 --> 00:09:31.151
It makes a big impressive. You have seen Australian Times.

00:09:31.151 --> 00:09:36.492
I had only one Sahaja Yogi with me thank God, that was Mr. Regis.

00:09:36.492 --> 00:09:41.168
I was only controlling him. Only one horse I had to control

00:09:41.168 --> 00:09:44.255
and he was all right. He behaved very well,

00:09:44.255 --> 00:09:46.358
otherwise he could have gone off you know.

00:09:46.358 --> 00:09:49.747
Anything is possible under the sun.

00:09:49.747 --> 00:09:53.729
But he behaved very well. He was quite under control

00:09:53.729 --> 00:09:56.549
and they were impressed by his presence there

00:09:56.549 --> 00:10:00.688
and they called him serene. Imagine Regis very serene.

00:10:00.688 --> 00:10:03.116
And he was very sweet I must say

00:10:03.116 --> 00:10:06.164
and he explained to them very well because he is well educated,

00:10:06.164 --> 00:10:08.640
he is a doctor.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.176
Today I played a trick on him though, I’m sorry for that.

00:10:12.176 --> 00:10:15.814
It was too much, whatever it is,

00:10:15.814 --> 00:10:20.501
but he, it worked out and he’s done it well.

00:10:20.501 --> 00:10:24.358
In the same way it is you people I have seen it

00:10:24.358 --> 00:10:26.455
and said it again and again,

00:10:26.455 --> 00:10:30.915
that you are the people who are going to

00:10:30.915 --> 00:10:33.725
bring Sahaja Yoga on this earth.

00:10:33.725 --> 00:10:39.604
You are the people who are going to do it. I am nothing.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:50.284
You see now when there is waterfall,

00:10:50.284 --> 00:10:55.101
what energy do you see? Nothing, it’s just a waterfall.

00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:59.415
But when you put it to turbines

00:10:59.415 --> 00:11:03.208
and take out that electricity from the turbines

00:11:03.208 --> 00:11:08.938
and then you see them here then you say, "yes there is electricity".

00:11:12.256 --> 00:11:17.538
Whatever is potential has no meaning.

00:11:17.538 --> 00:11:24.165
Whatever is kinetic, whatever is showing has a meaning.

00:11:24.165 --> 00:11:28.104
And so it is for you

00:11:28.104 --> 00:11:32.728
to be the showpieces of Sahaja Yoga, not Me.

00:11:32.728 --> 00:11:35.291
Because some will say

00:11:35.291 --> 00:11:37.939
that, “Oh you may be, so what,

00:11:37.939 --> 00:11:40.502
you are a different clan altogether.”

00:11:40.502 --> 00:11:45.590
Some may say that,

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:47.922
“Oh we can’t believe you.”

00:11:47.922 --> 00:11:51.239
But they will believe you much more they will believe Me.

00:11:51.239 --> 00:11:56.049
They will not believe Me at all. They’ll say I’m fantastic.

00:11:56.049 --> 00:11:59.680
I, I cannot be understood, you see?

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.767
So they won’t believe Me, they will believe you.

00:12:02.767 --> 00:12:06.354
They will not trust Me, but they will trust you.

00:12:06.354 --> 00:12:09.155
They would not trust Christ but they will trust you

00:12:09.155 --> 00:12:13.315
because you are one of them.

00:12:15.244 --> 00:12:19.113
That is why it is important that you should improve

00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:26.074
in all sincerity, in all truthfulness to yourself.

00:12:26.836 --> 00:12:31.955
Become a perfect mechanism of God.

00:12:31.955 --> 00:12:34.582
No reservations, should be no reservation.

00:12:34.582 --> 00:12:38.827
You see thinking, “All right, if I do this much

00:12:38.827 --> 00:12:42.065
then it’s all right, then I come back.”

00:12:42.065 --> 00:12:44.145
This is not all out effort.

00:12:44.145 --> 00:12:48.145
It seems to be very common you see, ‘cutting corners’ as they say.

00:12:48.145 --> 00:12:52.156
“Oh this much, all right, should I do this much

00:12:52.156 --> 00:12:54.418
or should I do this much?”

00:12:54.418 --> 00:12:57.386
I’ve seen very much discretion is used for all these things.

00:12:57.386 --> 00:13:02.878
It’s typical you see, “How many people so how many sandwiches?

00:13:02.878 --> 00:13:05.302
They will eat at the most two or three

00:13:05.302 --> 00:13:09.013
what’s the use of making more? So but everybody will not eat three

00:13:09.013 --> 00:13:13.552
so make it say two is all right, somebody will eat one.”

00:13:13.552 --> 00:13:16.552
These calculations, see?

00:13:17.349 --> 00:13:21.151
Who will eat one? The one who is calculating should not eat at all,

00:13:21.151 --> 00:13:24.647
then that’s the best way.

00:13:24.647 --> 00:13:27.886
But it’s all this calculations starts in the mind, you see,

00:13:27.886 --> 00:13:31.520
and these calculations ruin you.

00:13:34.179 --> 00:13:38.220
It’s a very tricky path. I know it’s very tricky.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:45.546
But you have beacons before you. Really I tell you, ‘lit’.

00:13:45.747 --> 00:13:47.990
Nobody had that.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.831
And you have got the torches in your hand.

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:56.651
And you have a balancing way automatically in built.

00:13:56.651 --> 00:14:01.952
Just trust in all those things, and if you walk straight forward,

00:14:01.952 --> 00:14:06.192
straight forward, forget all that is past,

00:14:06.192 --> 00:14:11.081
all that is nonsensical. Forget it, you are a different person.

00:14:11.081 --> 00:14:14.668
I’m sure you’ll rise very fast.

00:14:15.668 --> 00:14:20.768
And you will be really a living, organized being.

00:14:20.768 --> 00:14:26.278
All of you put together. Living, organized.

00:14:26.278 --> 00:14:30.405
These two are not complimentary ever.

00:14:30.405 --> 00:14:34.001
Because living is always disorganized,

00:14:34.072 --> 00:14:36.342
according to human concept like

00:14:36.342 --> 00:14:38.550
they will say that this flower comes out this way t

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.786
hat should come out that way. That human being’s thinking

00:14:41.786 --> 00:14:45.833
but God thinks that this is the wayit is organized.

00:14:45.833 --> 00:14:52.293
So, living organized means organized in the will of God.

00:14:53.772 --> 00:15:00.669
That’s how Sahaja Yogi are going to form that nucleus,

00:15:00.669 --> 00:15:07.169
that great nucleus, that powerful nucleus,

00:15:07.169 --> 00:15:13.312
that tremendous source

00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:18.621
which is going to overthrow all that is nonsensical.

00:15:20.097 --> 00:15:24.208
It is tremendous, believe Me.

00:15:25.421 --> 00:15:29.730
May God bless you
