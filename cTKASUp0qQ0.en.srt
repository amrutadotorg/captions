1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,760
The Chakra of the Goddess

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:25,840
lies behind the sternum bone in the spinal cord.

3
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,640
This Chakra is placed above the Bhavasagara,

4
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,800
above the Void, as we call it in Sahaja Yoga.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,520
And the bridge that has to be crossed

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:58,560
by the bhaktas, by the seekers, is guarded by.

7
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,600
She's the one, She helps Her children to come

8
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,680
through that passage

9
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,520
when there are negative forces trying to attack on a seeker.

10
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,920
This chakra is placed at the back of the sternum bone as I told you.

11
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,160
In childhood, the antibodies are formed

12
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,760
in the sternum bone.

13
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:49,240
They are the warriors or the Sainikas of the Devi.

14
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:56,480
Until the age of 12 years they grow and multiply,

15
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:05,440
and ultimately they all get distributed all over the body,

16
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,560
and a human being is made

17
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,160
able to face any outside invasion on him.

18
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:33,200
These antibodies know how to fight.

19
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,280
They are extremely confident

20
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,520
and they know who are their enemies.

21
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,160
They've all these messages built in themselves.

22
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,560
So when the anti-God element enters into the being

23
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,000
through any process,

24
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,640
say, through food, through words,

25
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,160
through action, through devilish people,

26
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,720
or black magic,

27
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,480
these antibodies combine together,

28
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,760
collectively fight the invaders.

29
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:39,240
Those who do not have their Central Heart properly developed

30
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,840
suffer from tremendous insecurity all their lives.

31
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,080
When they are children,

32
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:58,000
you try to control them by frightening.

33
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:05,640
These children later on become extremely insecure.

34
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,080
They are afraid of darkness, they are afraid of night.

35
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,320
Some of them are afraid of everything.

36
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:21,640
Because the antibodies that are built in the body

37
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,720
are not sufficient in number

38
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,160
and being this center so weak,

39
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,520
the person feels extremely insecure.

40
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,000
Later on in life when the child goes to the school

41
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:54,600
or he tries to work out something for the future,

42
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,560
then also his confidence can be shaken

43
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:05,480
by parents, teachers, and outside people.

44
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:13,280
So it is very important to understand children who are growing.

45
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,160
In the West they analyze everything

46
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,480
and try to put human beings into compartments.

47
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,040
First the child, is a child according to them,

48
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,320
child has no innocence,

49
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,040
and he's extremely selfish.

50
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,040
Second part is adolescence,

51
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:48,480
which they think is a very arbitrary, moody stuff.

52
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:56,760
In India, we do not know that there is something like adolescence.

53
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,640
Now these adolescent people form a group,

54
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,680
and they start criticizing or making fun of all the elders.

55
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,480
At a very young age it starts.

56
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,200
First they make fun of the teachers, then of the parents,

57
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,400
then of all the people who are senior to them.

58
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,960
They start becoming extremely active in their brains

59
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,600
because they see too many televisions and things like that,

60
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,200
and then they start behaving at a very young age

61
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:45,640
in such violent ways that one cannot imagine.

62
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,120
I used to live about 25 miles away from London.

63
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,960
And every time I would go to London,

64
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,560
I would find some children doing some sort of a mischief, somewhere.

65
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,720
One day some of them entered into my compartment,

66
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,360
and they started pulling out all the covers,

67
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,960
thrusting their knives into the seats,

68
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,120
opening out all the upholstery.

69
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,960
I was just sitting and watching.

70
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,280
So I said, "Now are you tired? Please sit down.

71
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,400
What's the problem?"

72
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,920
They said, "We are all very angry." I said, "For what?

73
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,760
Why are you angry?" Said, "We are just angry."

74
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,200
I said, "But you have to be angry for something."

75
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,520
They were children going to good schools definitely,

76
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,240
wearing very good clothes.

77
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,880
And then I had to, when the train stopped, I called the ticket collector

78
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,680
and told him that these boys have been

79
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,520
doing all this hooliganic, hooliganism

80
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,440
in the compartment and you better look at it.

81
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,480
And he came in and he said, "this is a common thing"

82
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,960
and then somehow or other he took them out.

83
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,440
But the only thing I felt about them is,

84
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,200
that all of them had their Center Heart catching.

85
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,040
On the Kundalini, they were catching their Center Heart.

86
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,560
But when they saw Me, they sat down.

87
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,640
They were quiet, they listened to Me.

88
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,960
I settled their Center Heart.

89
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,600
And most of them said, "We are angry with our mother."

90
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,280
"Why?" "Because our brothers are angry."

91
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,200
"But why your brothers are angry?"

92
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,840
Then I discovered that Freud has given these funny ideas

93
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,360
against the mother.

94
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,520
Mother itself, can you imagine!

95
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,720
What a anti-God activity it is.

96
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,640
To an Indian, Mother is the primal thing

97
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,600
any Indian.

98
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,400
Because his sense of security lies in the mother.

99
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,280
Even if the father is hot-tempered,

100
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,640
is angry, still they depend on the mother.

101
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,760
Because mother knows when to get angry

102
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,360
and when not to get angry. She has the discrimination.

103
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,760
And she is the one who protects them.

104
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,960
The idea of Mother is completely blasted in the West,

105
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,440
and this is the reason why

106
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,120
the children of that country feel so insecure,

107
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,240
and when they grow, they are extremely insecure.

108
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,920
You won't believe

109
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,880
that all the time they are polishing their brass,

110
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,440
cleaning their house,

111
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,280
but not even a rat enters their houses.

112
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
And if they have to talk to someone,

113
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,240
they'll make a person stand outside and talk from inside,

114
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,240
specially in London,

115
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,960
because they are literally frightened.

116
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,120
Nobody will believe,

117
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,760
the British who ruled us, are such frightened people.

118
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,600
But they are.

119
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,760
They are frightened of each other, they are frightened of themselves.

120
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:44,080
The reason is, the Center Heart is absolutely weak.

121
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,960
I've told you the first reason, the family insecurities.

122
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,280
The child does not know when he comes back from school,

123
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,480
whether his mother would be there or she would be gone.

124
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:04,120
They don't have mothers who can bear a lot from the husbands

125
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,600
and smile and show no signs of their agony to their children.

126
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,880
But the mothers in that country, I've seen,

127
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,600
always try to use their children

128
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,040
from all kinds of emotional blackmail, you can call it.

129
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,960
They try to torture the child

130
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,200
by telling all the things the husband is doing to them

131
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,840
and whatever is the problem they are facing with the husbands.

132
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,920
So the child is not secured by the mother, but, on the contrary,

133
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,800
child starts giving security to mother there.

134
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,680
At a very young age it starts,

135
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,760
and the child becomes extremely negative

136
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,120
and left-sided. He feels that he's born in a place

137
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,640
full of hatred, insecurity, and fear.

138
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,200
When a person is frightened,

139
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,400
this center start breathing fast,

140
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:09,200
giving rhythmic instructions to all the antibodies.

141
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:16,080
With that you feel you are getting a palpitation in the heart.

142
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,520
This palpitation is nothing

143
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,960
but a signal to all the antibodies to fight

144
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,520
the emergency of an attack.

145
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:43,680
But when somebody builds up insecurity later on in life,

146
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,680
it becomes a physical problem.

147
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,960
If they have insecurities earlier,

148
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,200
it is an emotional problem.

149
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,760
But later on in life,

150
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:01,680
when one develops a insecurity - any kind,

151
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,480
like a wife is insecure about her husband;

152
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,040
husband is a loafer or a bad man,

153
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,520
and carrying on with other women,

154
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:18,520
so the motherhood of the wife is challenged.

155
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,680
And when her motherhood is challenged,

156
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,760
she may get the weakening of this center,

157
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,520
by which she may suffer quite a lot

158
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,600
and may have even breast cancer.

159
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,120
These insecurities can be also self-made, imaginary.

160
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,960
People can just think about it

161
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,520
and build up some sort of insecurities,

162
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:48,880
which are of no actual existence.

163
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,880
But such fears are very much more in the West.

164
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,120
Because the life in the West has no mooring,

165
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,720
has no explanation.

166
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,040
Whatever you ask them, they'll say, "What's wrong?"

167
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,200
A husband will say, "What's wrong?" in having a keep.

168
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,600
And the wife will also say,

169
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,160
"All right, if he wants to have a keep, let him have it."

170
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,680
In India, no woman would tolerate such a situation.

171
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,040
She would starve, she would do everything,

172
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,800
but she will never touch a man who has a keep.

173
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:34,680
So the basis of the strength of Indian women

174
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,440
is their sense of chastity.

175
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,200
The sense of chastity

176
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,520
in the Indian women is so great

177
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,440
that nothing can deter them

178
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,200
as long as they are chaste.

179
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,520
But if they are not chaste,

180
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,360
then fear settles in them very fast.

181
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,880
Chastity is the strength of women.

182
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,520
And that's why those women who have fear, mostly,

183
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,600
have a problem of their chastity being challenged.

184
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:22,560
A woman who is frightened that her chastity may be disturbed,

185
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:30,920
also can develop a problem with the Heart Chakra.

186
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,000
Such women can develop

187
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,600
breast cancers, breathing troubles,

188
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,040
and other kind of frightening diseases

189
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,120
on the emotional level also.

190
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,280
This Chakra is ruined in women

191
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,240
when they lose their only child;

192
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,760
because their motherhood is finished, they feel.

193
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,960
And that is the worst thing that can happen to a woman,

194
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,960
if she's a woman.

195
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,760
But if she's not a woman, she doesn't feel much,

196
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,360
and she just behaves in a very manly way.

197
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,320
And that's what I've seen in the West,

198
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:28,360
that women really don't much care when their children die.

199
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,840
But it is because they are not women.

200
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,840
If you are a woman

201
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,040
you definitely feel for your children and their death.

202
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,120
But after some time,

203
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,720
such a woman comes back again

204
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,880
and she accepts the life as it is, for the sake of her husband,

205
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,920
or may be if she has more relations or other children.

206
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,160
She becomes extremely powerful

207
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,000
as a reaction to what has happened to her.

208
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:10,200
That's only possible if your center of Heart is all right.

209
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,800
Such women do not grudge, do not complain,

210
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,520
are extremely serene,

211
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,120
and can bear up lots of things.

212
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,360
They are extremely tolerant

213
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:28,120
and can go to any extent to help their children,

214
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,360
but they are never spoiling their children.

215
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,200
They never spoil their children,

216
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,200
because they understand

217
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,280
spoiling is much worse than beating the child.

218
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,880
They never spoil the children, nor ever pamper them,

219
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:46,920
and never get dominated by their children.

220
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,440
They know, "I have to guide the child

221
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,520
and have to look after the child."

222
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,440
So they look after all the ideals and righteousness

223
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,280
and the virtues of the child.

224
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,120
And if he tries to get out of it,

225
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,200
they go all out to win him over back to virtue

226
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,680
and to better life.

227
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,040
But those people, those women, who do not care

228
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,120
for actual growth of the child,

229
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,440
may just avoid it and escape it.

230
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,120
In the men, this chakra is caught up

231
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,600
if they have lost their mother very early,

232
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,960
or if their mother by chance is a very cruel woman.

233
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,680
Also this chakra can be caught up by men,

234
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,160
if they have been to wars,

235
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,840
and if they have seen frightful things in the war.

236
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,120
Such people could be extremely emotional

237
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,400
and could be easily befooled

238
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,600
by people who try to win over their emotions.

239
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,040
This Heart Center is caught up by various emotional problems

240
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,200
in human beings.

241
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,280
Husband and wife, if they all the time quarrel,

242
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,600
there's always quarrelling in the house,

243
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,960
especially if the mother is very dominating,

244
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,680
the child develops this center.

245
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,600
And if the father is very dominating,

246
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,440
the child develops this - the Heart itself.

247
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,960
So it is very important that

248
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,760
husband and wife should never quarrel

249
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,040
in the presence of their children.

250
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,040
Center Heart can be developed in countries

251
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,680
where there's all fear, people are frightened.

252
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,280
It can be developed by other things

253
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,440
by which people are frightened.

254
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,040
Reading books of bad gurus

255
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,200
and reading the books about

256
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,040
shocking things, like many people who read

257
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,440
the Kundalini's book have got Center Heart

258
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,200
because they are so frightened about the Kundalini!

259
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,440
Anything that frightens you if you read

260
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,520
can make your heart very, very weak and dangerous.

261
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,440
So the right side of every human being

262
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,520
represents the fatherhood, the Fatherhood.

263
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,280
And the Fatherhood of a man is very important.

264
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,520
If this center is spoilt,

265
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,440
or if there's something wrong with it,

266
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,440
then you get asthma as a disease.

267
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,440
Asthma is only caused

268
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,880
by this center being spoilt

269
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,280
or some other combinations with this center.

270
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,360
Asthma is very common among girls and boys.

271
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,800
And the relationship with the father,

272
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,080
or the understanding of the father,

273
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,760
or your own fatherhood is not all right,

274
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,440
you get this trouble of asthma,

275
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,680
and for that one has to ask the questions to the sadhakas,

276
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,680
what sort of a father you have. As one gentleman came and asked Me,

277
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,960
"Why everybody's asking me, what sort of a father you have?

278
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,960
What sort of a - everybody asked me, what about your father,

279
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,440
what about your father?

280
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,520
What has my father to do with me?"

281
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,760
Actually everybody feels the Right Heart,

282
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,880
and they have to ask about the father.

283
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,280
Because father resides in the Right Heart,

284
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,720
and the principle of fatherhood, if it is spoilt,

285
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,960
if there is a problem with the principle of fatherhood,

286
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,520
then you get this problem and many other problems

287
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,680
which I do not want to discuss now at length.

288
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,120
But you can understand a person who has no father,

289
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,280
how diffident he is, and how he behaves,

290
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,600
and also such people, those who have not known a father,

291
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,880
can become very wayward, licentious or permissive,

292
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,200
or could be very much secretly licentious.

293
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,960
The people who lose their father do not

294
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,360
have that lacking - a lacking --

295
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,840
they lack in that discipline that the father gives them.

296
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,600
Or could be, such people

297
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,200
could take to a very remorse and unhappy life.

298
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,120
Or they could be very hard on their children,

299
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,200
or could be extremely kind and spoil the children.

300
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,320
It could be any way. So it has of both the reactions,

301
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,520
either too much of love-giving or too much of strictness.

302
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,200
It can be anything.

303
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,520
Or a person could be of this kind,

304
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,520
may be very strict in childhood,

305
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,600
and could be extremely lavish in old age.

306
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,200
It's a - it is a very imbalanced personality.

307
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,120
So the person who has no father

308
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,440
has to know that his father is Shri Rama.

309
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,280
He should not worry about anything.

310
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,680
He is the One, with one arrow

311
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,960
He can kill any number of people.

312
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,680
So he should have no fear, at all,

313
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,280
about his father not being there

314
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,520
or father being dead or something happening like that.

315
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,000
On the contrary, if the father is dead,

316
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,200
it's better to tell him not to worry about you

317
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,040
and that you are all right,

318
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,200
so that you leave your father in peace

319
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,880
and ask him to take his birth,

320
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,760
than to bind him to this earth.

321
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,040
This is the Right Heart and the Left Heart is the mother,

322
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,040
actually your own mother, whosoever it is.

323
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,280
That is the motherhood, in the sense,

324
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,760
that if your mother has been extremely unkind

325
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
and extremely funny,

326
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,040
or your relationship with mother is bad,

327
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,360
then know that there's something wrong on the Left Heart

328
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,880
which is indicated in you.

329
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,080
So these two points are very important in human beings.

330
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,200
If a Sahaja Yogi just decides that

331
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,280
"I have a Father and a Mother;

332
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,040
God Almighty is my Father and my Mother"

333
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,280
then these problems can be easily solved.

334
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,760
But in Sahaja Yoga,

335
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,760
it is not what you think that works out, it does not.

336
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,960
Like in the car if you sit down and think that,

337
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,960
"I am going to Connaught Place", you won't move.

338
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,760
You have to move your hands.

339
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,760
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga you have to move your hands.

340
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,120
Clear you Chakras, move them higher and put them up.

341
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,880
It's not what you think is important in Sahaja Yoga.

342
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,200
Not at all. You may think that,

343
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,360
"I'm doing very well in Sahaja Yoga, I'm very good",

344
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,520
but it's not so.

345
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,600
It is what you actually achieve, your ascent is the point.

346
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,760
So, as in the car, as I told you,

347
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,360
you cannot just sit down and think and do the job.

348
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,600
In the same way, you have to run this machine,

349
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,120
and you have to see that you get all this movement.

350
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,520
There should be "ghati" in you. Otherwise,

351
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,280
there is no sense in just talking about Sahaja Yoga,

352
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,960
thinking about Sahaja Yoga,

353
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,200
and convincing yourself that you are a great Sahaja Yogi.

354
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,960
It is how you manifest it is the point,

355
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,040
which very few people understand.

356
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,200
Very, very few people understand that

357
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,960
it has to be manifesting, it has to be karyanmit.

358
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,360
It is not just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk morning till evening.

359
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,600
Even when I'm talking, now I'm opening your heart,

360
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,040
Heart Center.

361
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,960
I'm working it.

362
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,600
Even I'm talking, also I'm opening. It's working.

363
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,960
You will see your Heart Chakra is open

364
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,600
by the time I finish My lecture.

365
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,680
It is so, because I know how to do it.

366
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,120
When I talk I'm just watching

367
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,120
where the Chakras are catching,

368
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,360
what's happening and I'm catching all these points and touching it

369
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,880
and trying to open it.

370
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:34,360
And that's how it should be, that even when you talk it should be karyanvit.

371
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,680
Even when you are quiet and raising hands

372
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,880
it should be karyanvit.

373
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,760
Whatever you do, you should be karyanvit.

374
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,880
Even if you glance at anyone it should be karyanvit,

375
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,440
it should not be just

376
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,720
a kind of a jabbering that we do sometimes about Sahaja Yoga.

377
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,880
The greatest fear human beings have

378
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,280
that they think they have done lots of mistakes,

379
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,960
and these mistakes are too many,

380
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,960
and they can never get Realization,

381
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,520
they'll be doomed, they'll be going to hell.

382
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,680
This is not true, at all true.

383
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,600
Nobody is going to go hell

384
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,120
if they you do not want to.

385
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,960
If you want to stop it, you can stop it.

386
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,520
The time has come.

387
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,880
You are going to be blessed and blessed for ever.

388
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,360
So may God bless you!

389
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,960
Today's lecture I've given you

390
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,600
in a way that you should understand importance

391
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,680
of confidence, but not by saying, "I am confident."

392
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,440
Because when you say outwardly you are actually egoistical.

393
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,520
But when you say in your vibrations,

394
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,080
then you are confident.

395
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,880
May God bless you all!
