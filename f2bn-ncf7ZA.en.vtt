[CLAPS]

19:09.398 --> 19:12.518
Hello, hello

19:13.238 --> 19:20.258
Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I want to welcome you here on behalf of sahaja yoga, in Victoria

19:20.938 --> 19:28.438
and in particular to draw to your attention to the fact that we have now in our midst

19:28.638 --> 19:36.318
a very great personality, whose affect on hundreds and thousands of people round the world has been

19:36.518 --> 19:40.558
quite dynamic and in many respects, unbelievable.

19:41.798 --> 19:48.358
Now the Russians have flooded into sahaja yoga,

19:48.918 --> 19:54.698
the Europeans in 64 countries is operative,

19:54.998 --> 19:59.378
it's a very, very big undertaking in India

20:00.098 --> 20:05.238
and it's on these occasions that one realizes the immense importance of

20:05.738 --> 20:09.298
uh.. the individual life and the collective life

20:09.598 --> 20:14.698
and how these are now coming together in a very, very positive way.

20:15.818 --> 20:22.658
When our friend Steven here was talking to you about the nature of the inner

20:22.878 --> 20:28.778
quality of dynamic, which we call the Kundalini and the chakra system

20:29.178 --> 20:34.218
that we're looking at something which has been embedded in human-beings

20:34.578 --> 20:40.838
and has been awakened through the great historical periods by dynamic and

20:41.278 --> 20:48.858
uh.. highly spiritual avatars. Each of these chakras represents a stage in human development

20:49.198 --> 20:56.938
and they're all there in every human-being. Not only that the power of the Kundalini

20:57.558 --> 21:04.878
is so uh..as we are aware, spread throughout the whole of the human race and it's importance is so great

21:05.138 --> 21:10.878
that when one sits awake and all those distinctions of race, of class,

21:11.178 --> 21:19.138
of wealth, of poverty, of importance in society, are illuminated

21:19.558 --> 21:23.598
and the human-being can, for the first time,

21:23.878 --> 21:31.358
uh.. actually move into the consciouness of what the real self is, not the self which sits on the surface,

21:31.678 --> 21:35.118
the self which belongs to the ego

21:35.338 --> 21:40.078
and the emotions, but the real self which is hidden deeply in the unconscious

21:40.318 --> 21:44.938
and these two things are dynamic of that Kundalini awakening

21:45.258 --> 21:51.538
and the entry into consciousness of the operations of the real self

21:51.738 --> 21:56.898
which, in fact, is linked with all other human-beings and all life,

21:57.178 --> 22:03.758
is one of the great opportunities offered in this great critical time at the end of the twentieth century.

22:04.258 --> 22:09.938
Now this history, if you like, of the

22:11.738 --> 22:17.158
human-being in our civilization has been one from this operation

22:17.418 --> 22:22.478
as it were of the left side to the dynamic of the right side.

22:22.638 --> 22:29.238
The left side with it's emotion is particular quality of civilization is taken quite a number of centuries.

22:29.658 --> 22:35.178
If you look at human-beings in our Western world today, they're functioning with this ego,

22:35.458 --> 22:43.318
the personal consciousness and the dynamic of the right side or if we use the Sanskrit term, the Rajoguna,

22:43.698 --> 22:50.358
dynamic and externally oriented. And when one takes one's attention away

22:50.678 --> 22:56.278
as it were with [UNCLEAR - ROSETTE] from that externality, one has the chance

22:56.518 --> 23:00.158
in meditation to reach the real center.

23:00.398 --> 23:06.638
If you look at the history of civilization, you'll find that it's either the left or the right side,

23:06.878 --> 23:11.338
through great periods of time, that's been dominated in the way people act and behave.

23:11.618 --> 23:16.978
In our centuries, the acuteness of the ego is so great

23:17.178 --> 23:23.458
that the ego now feels itself totally cut off from life, from other human-beings

23:23.738 --> 23:30.478
and from the whole web of existence. And the ecological problems which exist in our external world

23:30.678 --> 23:36.698
and in nature are brought by the industrial society and expression of the fragmentation

23:36.918 --> 23:41.178
which is going on within the human-being uh.. internally.

23:41.538 --> 23:47.458
Now sahaja yoga offers that wonderful opportunity of bringing

23:47.798 --> 23:52.638
consciousness back into the center. We have never really tried

23:52.858 --> 23:58.338
as a civilization, to operate in the dynamic reascending mode

23:58.558 --> 24:06.038
which is this pathway here. And the purpose of the Kundalini is to pass through and awaken and cleanse

24:06.298 --> 24:11.598
each of the chakras within this system and ultimately to provide

24:11.878 --> 24:17.818
the total experience of what the self really is and that self is collective.

24:18.058 --> 24:23.538
It's not something which we can call uh the individual 'I' anymore, it's something which is

24:23.698 --> 24:30.638
deeply embedded in the whole totality of existence. Now, Shri Mataji is a remarkable figure,

24:30.858 --> 24:37.438
who in hundreds and thousands of instances has brought this realization

24:37.678 --> 24:43.058
to people all over the world. It is no longer an individual thing

24:43.278 --> 24:50.538
for a few people with a guru. It is now something to be experienced within the consciousness

24:50.758 --> 24:57.358
of modern man in vast numbers. In fact, the very

24:57.478 --> 25:05.118
uh.. existence of large numbers of people enhances the experience of this collective realization principle.

25:05.638 --> 25:11.078
So, I have the greatest pleasure in introducing this figure

25:11.338 --> 25:19.038
of world importance in, in the field of yoga - Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. [CLAPPING]

25:30.767 --> 25:34.427
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

25:40.027 --> 25:47.247
At the very outset we have to know, that truth is what it is.

25:49.227 --> 25:54.407
We cannot change it, we cannot transform it

25:55.307 --> 26:01.787
and unfortunately, at the level of human awareness, we cannot know it.

26:03.927 --> 26:08.107
The reason is, as they have explained to you already,

26:08.687 --> 26:12.967
these two things called conditionings and the ego

26:13.447 --> 26:18.507
are covering our brain. Apart from that

26:19.747 --> 26:25.727
we are not connected to the All-Pervading power, which is

26:27.047 --> 26:35.067
the love God. In these modern times, to talk of God is something out of trade.

26:35.647 --> 26:40.707
and also there are many people who have talked about God

26:41.487 --> 26:46.927
established religions, established all kinds of huge, big organizations

26:47.227 --> 26:50.907
and people have discovered that there's no truth in it.

26:52.487 --> 26:59.107
It's not based on truth though the Incarnations, prophets

26:59.927 --> 27:07.247
all of them have been expressing nothing but truth, manifesting nothing but truth.

27:07.427 --> 27:14.047
But somehow or other, all these organizations have deviated and what is the reason for that?

27:15.287 --> 27:20.547
The reason for that is simple thing which was important,

27:21.267 --> 27:27.347
is that one has to go beyond this human awareness

27:27.627 --> 27:34.287
through their Self-realization, through their second birth or as Walihood, as they call it in Islam.

27:35.527 --> 27:40.947
This was not at all attempted, nor the attention paid

27:41.187 --> 27:44.267
to such an important thing, that we have to

27:44.787 --> 27:51.427
get our Self-realization, that we have to be connected to this All-Pervading power of God.

27:52.527 --> 27:59.327
That's why they deviated into, I think, two three things, firstly it deviated into many orientation.

28:00.207 --> 28:03.487
It became the thing where people must make money.

28:04.047 --> 28:11.787
And such horrible things they have done, it's surprising how could they do it, when they were professing truth.

28:13.427 --> 28:21.327
The second was that they wanted to have power - they did for power so they mixed up politics, this that - such a mixture of things.

28:22.987 --> 28:29.247
But they are not spirit oriented - they didn't work out that you have to be the spirit.

28:30.967 --> 28:36.467
Now this mechanism exists within you, I say so, but you shouldn't take it for granted,

28:37.287 --> 28:43.787
you shouldn't believe Me blindly but you must experience yourself, if it is so.

28:44.447 --> 28:52.047
Like a hypothesis you can accept what I am saying but supposing I prove it, then you have to accept it as honest people.

28:52.307 --> 28:58.927
Because it is for your benevolence, is the benevolence of this Australia, benevolence of the whole world.

28:59.127 --> 29:05.167
This is what we have been waiting for all these days, this is being promised to us in all the scriptures.

29:05.507 --> 29:12.407
But instead of seeking that, people have deviated into businesses or into political organizations

29:15.067 --> 29:22.007
which is a very unjust, unfair treatment to Divinity.

29:25.907 --> 29:31.467
This Divinity resides within you all, as shown here, is within you.

29:31.747 --> 29:35.387
This power is within you, is your own power.

29:35.907 --> 29:42.307
Maybe, I just trigger it like one enlightened light can enlighten another light

29:42.947 --> 29:48.127
but is within you, residing just like a primule in a seed.

29:48.447 --> 29:55.367
And whatever powers you get afterwards, when you are connected to the mains, are also within you.

29:58.047 --> 30:02.687
You are not to feel obliged to Me nor am I in any way obligated to you.

30:03.287 --> 30:07.127
It's just that it is your own,

30:07.627 --> 30:12.427
this is your own property and that the key has to be found.

30:13.587 --> 30:19.987
Of course you can't pay for it - one must understand you can't pay for a higher awareness.

30:20.367 --> 30:25.567
What can you pay? It's something so natural - it's a living process

30:25.847 --> 30:30.867
and what do we pay to this Mother Earth for sprouting a seed - She doesn't understand even.

30:31.727 --> 30:38.127
So you can't pay for it - first of all understand that it is not something material that you can buy

30:38.427 --> 30:41.827
but it's your own energy which has to manifest it.

30:44.427 --> 30:49.947
Tomorrow, of course, I'm going to tell you about what is the nature of the spirit

30:50.927 --> 30:58.387
but today I've just to tell you one thing that this Kundalini is within you

30:59.627 --> 31:06.727
and when She rises, she definitely solves your physical, mental, emotional problems,

31:08.187 --> 31:14.227
also your material problems but above all your spiritual urge.

31:14.547 --> 31:18.187
They say that, in this

31:19.867 --> 31:24.487
Kaliyuga, ghor Kaliyuga - these modern times - this

31:25.367 --> 31:30.947
work will be done - is already been predicted

31:31.907 --> 31:38.447
that people who were seeking the truth in the hills and dales

31:39.187 --> 31:44.507
will find it within themselves, as ordinary householders.

31:44.787 --> 31:49.647
And that's what I find, is so easy. The time is such

31:50.167 --> 31:54.667
that it is working out in such great numbers.

31:56.087 --> 32:02.447
Surprisingly, in a place, which we call the country called Russia

32:02.847 --> 32:10.867
where they had never heard about God, they were not supposed to think about God, they were not supposed to even utter the word God

32:12.007 --> 32:18.607
where thousands and thousands have got realization and such seeking.

32:19.347 --> 32:26.227
I was wondering, what is the thing that they have that they should in thousands should come to these

32:26.547 --> 32:32.427
lectures of Mine and I had to arrange them in stadiums - never in a hall like this.

32:33.867 --> 32:38.947
And the way they got their realization is very surprising - how they got it.

32:40.387 --> 32:45.127
Because they said, "Mother, we have nothing to do with spirituality,

32:45.367 --> 32:51.367
we never heard there is something higher than this human awareness and how do we get this."

32:54.427 --> 33:02.447
I said, 'There must be something special about you.' And the special about them, I think, that they were kept out of materialism.

33:03.667 --> 33:07.347
They have everything provided for, whatever is necessary.

33:08.407 --> 33:14.107
Moreover, they are very introspective by nature, extremely introspective. If you read their

33:14.507 --> 33:20.307
writers like Tolstoy or anyone, even the hero will introspect himself.

33:21.047 --> 33:27.387
This introspection has brought forth such personalities that they are finding,

33:27.667 --> 33:32.487
one thing in common, that they haven't found out the Absolute Truth.

33:33.907 --> 33:38.667
Whatever they know is on the relative terminology - even the Science.

33:38.827 --> 33:44.347
Science, they think, is all the time changing, is nothing of a permanent nature.

33:44.627 --> 33:51.627
And when I address there, the Scientists, they said, "Mother, tell us everything else but not Science - we had enough of it."

33:52.247 --> 33:58.567
So this is what it is, that we have to see also what all these enterprises we have entered into.

33:59.547 --> 34:07.367
Like Science, what has happened to us. Today we have created a big devil there, atom bomb and here a Hydrogen bomb sitting on our head.

34:08.127 --> 34:13.967
We have created those devils and they are frightening us. We have created these ecological problems.

34:14.207 --> 34:18.047
We have created this political problems, economical problems ourselves.

34:19.107 --> 34:24.447
That means, something wrong with human-beings, that means, they haven't found the Absolute.

34:26.187 --> 34:29.647
So, this human-being has to be transformed.

34:31.247 --> 34:35.127
This transformation once takes place, you become the Spirit.

34:35.387 --> 34:42.767
It's question of becoming, it's not just giving a sermon or a lecture or anything like that - it's, it should happen to you.

34:43.547 --> 34:50.187
From this human awareness you have to become a higher personality, which is a spiritual awareness.

34:51.427 --> 34:59.167
This can happen very easily. Sahaja means also very easy, simple - also it means born with you.

34:59.487 --> 35:06.287
So you all have a birthright, you're born with this birthright, to get your Self-realization.

35:07.147 --> 35:15.127
For that, you do not have to pay, do not have to exert, it's, it's absolutely effortless

35:16.107 --> 35:21.187
and also you do not have to think about it because it is beyond thinking.

35:23.807 --> 35:29.447
So many things people are talking about, so many theories -

35:29.687 --> 35:33.507
they talk of Capitalism, Communism, this ism, that isms,

35:33.747 --> 35:38.627
goes on like a yarn out of the brain comes out and everybody gets engulfed.

35:38.787 --> 35:44.467
Once it is written down, it becomes a Bible - people start following it but of no avail.

35:46.367 --> 35:54.007
Only compartments have been created - you are this, you're that, you're a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, this, that and all that - into compartments.

35:54.707 --> 36:02.007
Human-beings are divided by all this thinking - you are a Communist, you are a Capitalist, you're this, you're that - you're not.

36:04.367 --> 36:10.367
You are a human-being to begin with and you're the pure Spirit. And if the Spirit

36:10.747 --> 36:18.207
is the reflection of one God, then how can we be separated, how can we put into some compartments.

36:18.967 --> 36:23.587
We are part and parcel of one God Almighty.

36:23.827 --> 36:30.127
The microcosm has to become the macrocosm, that's all. This happening has to take place

36:30.387 --> 36:35.167
where the drop of your personality has to become one with the whole.

36:35.827 --> 36:42.367
Also the concept of individuality is so wrong. This concept of individuality that we have

36:43.047 --> 36:51.067
is against the Spirit of the whole, absolutely against the Spirit of the whole but individuality,

36:51.647 --> 36:59.587
I mean, the way nature is individual in the sense every leaf is different from another leaf, every flower is different from another flower, to look at,

37:01.687 --> 37:09.007
but in it's nature it is just the same - it comes from the same source.

37:10.487 --> 37:14.967
In the same way, we have to become the Spirit though we may dress up separately,

37:15.127 --> 37:22.607
differently - I mean, in sahaja yoga nobody is wearing funny dresses, you see, like regimentation or some sort of a uh..

37:22.827 --> 37:29.527
orange dress or nothing of the kind. It's not the dress that matters, it's something very much inside and innate.

37:29.987 --> 37:35.587
So the innate religion has to be awakened. Unless and until that innate religion is awakened -

37:35.847 --> 37:42.187
you may be a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anything - you can commit any kind of sin,

37:42.447 --> 37:49.107
any kind of murder, any theft, anything that is all absolutely against the collective.

37:50.487 --> 37:57.167
Nothing stops you. That means whatever you're professing, is just outside, is just mental nothing has gone inside.

37:58.367 --> 38:05.207
Even if you are educated in that. You have seen the priest, you have seen the mullahs, you have seen all these people - they are so well educated -

38:05.547 --> 38:08.807
they do the same thing. What's wrong there?

38:09.267 --> 38:14.367
When they know this is right, why don't they do what is right?

38:15.527 --> 38:19.207
The reason is, they haven't got the power of the Spirit.

38:19.447 --> 38:25.567
In the light of the Spirit only, you become what you profess.

38:27.207 --> 38:34.907
You walk what you talk. We don't have to tell anyone that you do this and do that because they have the light.

38:35.787 --> 38:41.807
In their own light they see the same thing, understand the same thing, they know what is right and what is wrong

38:42.107 --> 38:45.407
and what is good for you, what is for your benevolence.

38:45.687 --> 38:52.487
Of course, by the raising of this Kundalini, as I told you, many diseases can be cured physically.

38:52.827 --> 38:59.907
We have three doctors in Delhi, those who have got M.D. after doing their M.B.B.S.

39:00.687 --> 39:07.407
in the subject of sahaja yoga. They have cured people of some incurable diseases.

39:07.767 --> 39:14.767
And now, there are seven doctors in England, also we have doctors here, two or three, who are collecting datas to show how

39:15.007 --> 39:21.107
sahaja yoga can cure you without wasting your time into something

39:21.387 --> 39:27.127
that we call as the medicines and all artificial things.

39:28.587 --> 39:35.887
So many things can be done with your own power. You don't have to depend on anybody else

39:36.167 --> 39:43.887
but the cleansing part of your being takes place when you become collective,

39:44.167 --> 39:49.367
when you are together. Like supposing, a nail of Mine is broken, it won't grow.

39:50.527 --> 39:55.587
It will be just left at the same point where it was thrown away.

39:55.887 --> 40:03.167
In the same way, if you are collective, the whole body of Spirituality will cleanse you completely,

40:03.647 --> 40:10.527
will manifest all your powers, will give you what you're worth.

40:11.027 --> 40:15.547
You have to know your glory, you have to know your beauty.

40:15.827 --> 40:22.667
And no use condemning yourself that, "I'm a sinner, I've done this wrong, that wrong." After all you're human-beings

40:23.027 --> 40:27.367
and as human-beings we're supposed to commit mistakes - we're not Gods.

40:27.707 --> 40:32.927
So those people who tell you that, "You're a sinner, this thing, that thing," should see their own sins.

40:34.167 --> 40:40.027
So please have no diffidence about yourself, no diffidence at all.

40:40.327 --> 40:45.767
I assure you all of you can get realization, if you can just get over your diffidence.

40:46.767 --> 40:54.147
It's one thing we have to accept that we're human-beings and we are

40:54.727 --> 41:01.967
the epitome of evolution. We have evolved up to this state and a little more is needed which is

41:02.987 --> 41:10.127
very easy and should happen to you - is already built-in within you, is already there. For example, see this instrument is

41:10.327 --> 41:16.327
made but if it is not put to the mains, it has no meaning. In the same way you're to be put to the mains

41:16.647 --> 41:22.627
and this All-Pervading power about which I'm saying, we start feeling it for the first time.

41:23.687 --> 41:27.747
We see these beautiful flowers all around, we take them for granted.

41:28.667 --> 41:34.967
How have they come out of this Mother Earth which looks so gross and out of one seed?

41:35.427 --> 41:39.007
How these different flowers have come with different personalities?

41:40.407 --> 41:44.907
We take them for granted. All the living work we take it for granted,

41:45.107 --> 41:50.827
even ourselves. Look at our eye, what a camera it is! Look at our brain,

41:52.987 --> 42:01.267
what a computer it is! We take it for granted. Why? Because we have no answer - we cannot say how.

42:02.067 --> 42:08.687
But in sahaja yoga we'll know how it works out. I hope, you all will take your realization

42:09.027 --> 42:14.047
and tomorrow again I'll tell you all about the Spirit, what the Spirit is.

42:14.467 --> 42:19.047
You don't have to take Me for granted, again I'm saying that - blind faith is not needed

42:19.307 --> 42:25.727
but as Scientist you must keep an open mind to test for yourself and see for yourself.

42:27.227 --> 42:35.167
It will hardly take ten minutes, maybe, five minutes also for you to get your realization. There is no

42:36.887 --> 42:44.247
necessity for you to have any kind of a reading done or any kind of a uh.. penance done.

42:46.007 --> 42:53.307
As long as a human-being, you're a human-being and that you desire, very strongly,

42:53.547 --> 42:57.387
your Self-realization, nothing more is needed.

42:57.607 --> 43:01.707
This Kundalini is the power of your pure desire.

43:02.127 --> 43:06.227
All other desires are not pure because they're never satiable.

43:07.247 --> 43:14.767
So, this pure desire should be in your heart that, "I should get my Self-realization and let my, all my powers manifest."

43:15.827 --> 43:20.607
I think, we can have some little time for questioning

43:20.947 --> 43:27.627
but please don't ask Me unnecessary questions to waste time for everyone because

43:30.527 --> 43:35.087
it's easy to answer because I'm now quite an expert

43:35.327 --> 43:41.907
I've been working on this for twenty one years and I know all the Western minds how they work and the Eastern minds how they work

43:42.287 --> 43:49.507
and I can answer all your questions still, I would request you that it's not important.

43:50.207 --> 43:53.887
Even if I answer you, even if you are satisfied mentally

43:56.007 --> 43:59.767
still, it's no guarantee that your Kundalini will rise.

44:00.487 --> 44:07.827
Main thing is that your Kundalini must rise and you must get your Self-realization, which is the actualization of baptism.

44:08.247 --> 44:16.227
Is actualization, it is not just putting My hand on your head and say that now you have got your realization or you have got your baptism.

44:17.367 --> 44:24.587
This is what it is, so I would request you, if you have any questions, do ask Me, please. Thank you very much.

44:31.747 --> 44:38.127
- [INAUDIBLE]
- What did he say?
-

44:38.367 --> 44:44.467
- When You raise the Kundalini, don't you automatically raise the impurities and the chakras as well?
- Yeah.

44:47.047 --> 44:51.207
You see, the Kundalini is to be understood in a very proper way.

44:51.507 --> 44:58.087
These are the chakras, say on the Left Sympathetic and the Right Sympathetic, when they meet they make the Parasympathetic Nervous System

44:58.187 --> 45:05.187
and these are the centers. Now, when you start using too much of right or left side, then what happens that they become constricted.

45:05.687 --> 45:11.607
Now, when the Kundalini rises, She doesn't rise the whole of Her own body -

45:11.907 --> 45:18.907
it's like many strings put together like a rope - so some strings rise and they try to expand

45:19.307 --> 45:26.547
this space by nourishing those centers but completely they're not nourished,

45:26.867 --> 45:33.227
not nourished fully. Some people do have very beautiful uh.. balanced life,

45:33.727 --> 45:41.587
they do get it but not mostly, they don't. So what happens, when the Kundalini rises, She passes through the, nourishes there

45:41.907 --> 45:47.827
and pierces through your fontanel bone area but it's a very small thread, I should say, in the beginning

45:48.307 --> 45:53.587
which passes through the very, very subtle uh.. channel, we call as Brahma nadi.

45:53.807 --> 45:58.227
When it pierces through, then it opens this,

45:58.707 --> 46:05.887
I should say, the, as the ego and conditioning part of it, these two open out and this thousand petalled

46:07.527 --> 46:12.927
chakra, we call as the Sahastrara, the thousand petalled lotus also opens out.

46:13.747 --> 46:20.047
When it opens out it gets connected, of course, but the connection is not established fully.

46:20.407 --> 46:27.087
Even if you connect this, it may not be if it is little faulty, may not be established. So it has to be established.

46:27.347 --> 46:34.327
That hardly, it takes a  month at the most, for some people it doesn't even take one day, even one minute.

46:34.707 --> 46:42.847
So depends on. So we have to pay respect to ourselves and understand that if there's any problem, doesn't matter, we should correct it.

46:43.427 --> 46:48.227
Then also you must know, what it is. You must have the full knowledge as to

46:48.887 --> 46:55.187
what is this Kundalini, what you have achieved, what are your powers, how can you work it out

46:55.467 --> 47:01.107
everything you must know because once you're enlightened, you should be able to give light to others.

47:01.667 --> 47:09.007
After this happening, you can give realization to others - you get that power - you can cure people, you can put them right.

47:09.307 --> 47:17.147
Even a person who is spiritually so awakened, even if he enters any place, peace comes in,

47:17.947 --> 47:21.307
balance, equilibrium even in the nature comes in.

47:21.947 --> 47:26.427
So, such a personality if you create within yourself,

47:26.927 --> 47:33.007
you have to do it and that if it is required little time, you should give that time to yourself.

47:33.787 --> 47:39.327
And then, when in a full way you become a really a Divine personality.

47:40.167 --> 47:48.167
That's what we have to achieve but you don't have to give up your families, you don't have to give up your anything - it's something that happens within yourself.

47:49.147 --> 47:54.107
And that should happen to all of us. It makes no difference what age you are, it makes no difference

47:54.507 --> 47:59.947
what race you are, nothing of the kind. As long as you are a human-being, it works out.

48:05.707 --> 48:12.247
[INAUDIBLE]

48:12.527 --> 48:20.547
The question is, what is actually the meaning of the term realization and what actually is happening.

48:21.387 --> 48:24.407
We have told them.

48:24.747 --> 48:31.807
Actually happening is the awakening of the Kundalini and you are getting connected to the mains, means the All Pervading power,

48:32.067 --> 48:35.047
which is all the time flowing through you.

48:35.247 --> 48:42.467
Now, what is Self-realization, that I'm going to tell you tomorrow, as I said, but in short is that you know about your own centers.

48:43.467 --> 48:47.847
You become aware of yourself firstly.

48:48.267 --> 48:52.587
Many things happen but one of them is, on a physical level you know.

48:52.847 --> 48:57.647
Now people get cancer they don't know if they're getting cancer, they become mad they don't know they're becoming mad.

48:58.347 --> 49:06.367
But you become knowledgeable, you can feel it, on your finger-tips you can feel it - your centers and the centers of others

49:06.987 --> 49:12.387
so that you become collectively conscious. Your conscious, consciousness

49:13.087 --> 49:20.087
is so much enlarged that you can feel the centers of other people. Sitting down here you can feel the centers of others.

49:20.307 --> 49:23.907
Then you don't talk about a person as an Australian, Indian or anything

49:24.147 --> 49:29.627
but you will say that this center is not all right, that center is not all right, this center is very good.

49:30.627 --> 49:33.907
This is the language you start talking about.

49:35.367 --> 49:41.547
And what happens is, such a lot, that in one lecture I don't think I can cover it.

49:41.747 --> 49:49.207
But tomorrow, I'm sure, I'll be able to tell you elaborately what all the good things happen to a person who is a Self-realized.

49:52.227 --> 49:57.927
First you get your Self-realization, is better. For example, you see here beautiful lights are here

49:58.667 --> 50:03.407
and when you come, you have to just switch on one switch

50:04.867 --> 50:08.627
because it's all built-in there, it's there existing.

50:09.087 --> 50:13.647
What's the use of telling about all the history of these lights and the history of electricity

50:13.927 --> 50:20.887
and all how it came here to Melbourne and how it was brought here. Better have your lights first and then we'll talk about it

50:22.247 --> 50:25.427
otherwise it will be boring.

50:31.027 --> 50:34.007
Any more questions?

50:37.307 --> 50:45.227
I'm saying that [UNCLEAR]

50:45.547 --> 50:53.327
[UNCLEAR]

50:53.547 --> 51:00.447
[UNCLEAR]

51:00.707 --> 51:08.547
[UNCLEAR]

51:08.787 --> 51:16.047
[UNCLEAR]

51:16.307 --> 51:24.287
- I didn't follow him.
- The questioner is a little uncertain about the nature of the term

51:24.707 --> 51:30.227
desiring the Spirit. In order to achieve the Spirit, you have to desire it

51:30.567 --> 51:36.607
and that you have to have a purity of Spirit in order to achieve the Spirit.

51:36.887 --> 51:42.687
You see, why I said you have to desire because God has given you freedom.

51:43.467 --> 51:48.147
I cannot be disrespectful to that freedom.

51:48.987 --> 51:53.607
If you don't desire, I cannot force on you, cannot be done.

51:58.967 --> 52:01.867
You have to ask for it.

52:04.927 --> 52:11.407
It cannot be forced, it cannot be... we cannot mesmerize people, we cannot do something like that,

52:12.007 --> 52:15.507
you cannot force people, you cannot dominate -

52:15.787 --> 52:21.807
it is your will which has to come. Only through your sweet will it will work out.

52:29.747 --> 52:35.647
And do you know that many have written about this - like William Blake has written

52:36.287 --> 52:44.347
that, "Men of God," - it's a special category of people  who are seekers of truth, it's a special category. He's described them

52:44.827 --> 52:49.867
as, "Men of God will know God and they'll have powers to make others Godly."

52:50.147 --> 52:56.007
So many have said about this in India also but I must say William Blake was a great seer

52:56.227 --> 53:00.307
that he could see this so clearly what was going to happen in the future.

53:07.587 --> 53:12.707
[INAUDIBLE]

53:12.967 --> 53:17.147
- Why not have faith in Western medicine?
- Annh?

53:17.387 --> 53:22.767
- Why not have faith in Western medicine?
- You should, why not. I did also western medicine, you must have.

53:23.147 --> 53:29.767
But I'm saying, your faith in Western medicine is all right but they have no control over Parasympathetic Nervous System.

53:30.147 --> 53:34.707
There're many things which cannot be answered by medical sciences

53:34.947 --> 53:39.087
but if we can manage it with something else, why not do it.

53:50.807 --> 53:58.207
- So quiet [UNCLEAR] They're in thoughtless awareness
- Looks like questions are finished.
- [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] All right.

54:06.627 --> 54:12.147
Agnya chakra which is shown there. Then what happens

54:12.627 --> 54:18.307
that these two conditioning and ego, these two institutions are sucked in like that.

54:20.887 --> 54:24.827
With that you achieve a state which we call as

54:26.047 --> 54:30.987
thoughtless awareness, called as 'nirvichar samadhi' in Sanskrit language.

54:31.387 --> 54:36.207
Thoughtless awareness, means you are absolutely aware but there is no thought.

54:36.487 --> 54:42.927
Otherwise we are always bombarded with thinking. Thoughts are coming whether you like it or not - you can't stop it.

54:44.267 --> 54:50.387
Now, thoughts come either from the future or from the past.

54:51.447 --> 54:58.747
In the present if I say, "Stop your thought," you cannot. And you cannot be in the present unless and until you stop your thoughts.

55:00.087 --> 55:05.127
So, the first state that comes to you, that you become thoughtlessly aware

55:05.447 --> 55:11.207
means you have a command over your thoughts. If you want you'll think otherwise you'll not think.

55:12.527 --> 55:17.027
And you grow spiritually only when you are in the present.

55:17.407 --> 55:22.307
If I say, "Pay attention to yourself," you can't. Say, "How to pay attention inside?"

55:24.627 --> 55:32.327
But supposing Kundalini rises, then the attention, which we can say, like a sari like this and it pushes up

55:33.107 --> 55:38.467
the attention. Attention, here, when it reaches

55:39.827 --> 55:47.727
then the Grace starts falling or you can say the light starts falling on the attention and your attention becomes enlightened.

55:49.987 --> 55:55.547
but you are in thoughtless awareness state.

55:57.167 --> 56:01.647
Afterwards, when you have established your connections properly

56:02.207 --> 56:07.587
then you are in the second state, that we call as doubtless awareness.

56:09.267 --> 56:14.727
And this doubtless awareness state in which you start manifesting all your powers -

56:15.087 --> 56:18.527
and this is what we have to achieve,

56:20.567 --> 56:27.407
which is very easy, works out in a very simple way; of course, you don't have to pay at all for that.

56:29.767 --> 56:36.007
And it works wonderfully because you get the proof of it.

56:39.027 --> 56:46.547
You get these powers working and you understand that these powers are working.

56:47.807 --> 56:55.607
You have to certify yourself - nobody is going to give you the certificate. It is you who's going to decide it.

56:58.287 --> 57:05.707
Is it all right now, should we have the session for Self-realization?

57:09.467 --> 57:17.347
- Second [UNCLEAR]
- [INAUDIBLE]

57:17.587 --> 57:22.647
[INAUDIBLE]

57:22.967 --> 57:30.227
Can you achieve a balance of the chakras through mantras and meditation or singing?

57:30.407 --> 57:36.727
Of course, but it's a science; One has to know what to do exactly.

57:36.987 --> 57:41.487
It's not just say any mantras. You see, these, there are people giving mantras

57:42.047 --> 57:46.427
for 300 pounds or 6000 pounds - I mean, nonsense it is.

57:48.847 --> 57:55.087
And mantras are related to your chakras, which you yourself will know.

57:55.807 --> 58:00.567
But mostly it is not needed. If it is needed, you have to, may also have to do

58:00.927 --> 58:05.227
some sort of a asana, as Hatha yoga is but very rarely.

58:06.687 --> 58:13.687
So mantras do not play much role, unless and until, you have that problem then you have to use the mantras

58:14.047 --> 58:19.407
but which is the chakra for which you need, you have to find out first of all.

58:19.687 --> 58:27.027
That's only possible when the Kundalini rises, then you know where there is obstructed, then you have to use a particular mantra - that helps.

58:27.407 --> 58:35.467
On the whole, all this knowledge is very easily available - it's not difficult - but first of all you must enter into the Kingdom of God

58:36.707 --> 58:44.007
then you're looked after. Unless and until that has happened, is impossible - it will be just talk, talk and talk.

58:44.627 --> 58:49.487
And you have had many talks, it should not be another talk to you

58:50.067 --> 58:55.207
but it should happen - is the becoming.

59:01.907 --> 59:08.227
All these things which we have known, part here, part there, something false, something true.-

59:08.727 --> 59:12.687
in the light you see everything so clearly.

59:15.227 --> 59:21.147
In the darkness of ignorance, you believe this is true, this is true, that should be such

59:21.387 --> 59:28.287
but what you need, is the enlightened mind. Once you're enlightened, you are a different person altogether.

59:36.727 --> 59:43.207
So now, please don't get worried

59:43.627 --> 59:49.147
about yourself. You are all going to get your Self-realization.

59:50.187 --> 59:54.367
Don't doubt yourself. That's the first condition is, relax.

59:55.287 --> 01:00:00.667
Don't doubt yourself. You're all going to get your realization.

01:00:01.927 --> 01:00:06.327
I have no doubts about it but if you doubt yourself, I can't help it.

01:00:08.087 --> 01:00:14.147
Must have full confidence in yourself - that is the first condition.

01:00:16.687 --> 01:00:20.747
The second condition is that,

01:00:21.707 --> 01:00:26.407
you're not to feel guilty about anything, whatsoever.

01:00:32.507 --> 01:00:40.247
It's a fashion these days also to feel guilty for nothing at all - specially in English language, we go on saying sorry, sorry, morning till evening.

01:00:40.807 --> 01:00:48.507
Even on the telephone you see now in Our times We used to say 'beg your pardon' but nowadays people say sorry for that also. I don't know

01:00:48.707 --> 01:00:52.127
for anything they go on saying sorry. What is there to be sorry about?

01:00:53.687 --> 01:00:58.327
So, in short, you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:00:59.807 --> 01:01:05.647
Don't have any diffidence. Whatever has been a mistake is all right, has to be corrected

01:01:05.907 --> 01:01:13.147
and can be done very easily, if you have self-confidence. So please, don't feel guilty.

01:01:15.227 --> 01:01:21.467
Don't start confessing in your mind, what wrong you have done to yourself or anything - please, please, don't.

01:01:22.907 --> 01:01:30.407
And third condition is also very simple, if you understand, that you have to forgive everyone, in general.

01:01:32.927 --> 01:01:37.607
Now, this people sometimes say is very difficult but logically understand.

01:01:37.907 --> 01:01:43.047
Whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything - what do you do - nothing.

01:01:43.907 --> 01:01:47.047
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:01:47.367 --> 01:01:53.207
Those who wanted to trouble you, are happy while you are the one who is feeling extremely

01:01:53.447 --> 01:01:57.767
unhappy, all the time torturing yourself for the sake of others.

01:02:01.847 --> 01:02:07.567
So just forgive everyone - take it out of your mind. Now since I've come to Australia,

01:02:08.787 --> 01:02:15.107
I find, when I meet them, that they say, "Mother, difficult to forgive, difficult to forgive."

01:02:15.367 --> 01:02:20.367
I mean, there's nothing difficult - it's your own mental nonsense - throw it away.

01:02:20.927 --> 01:02:28.687
You'll feel so much lighter just now. Just say, "I forgive everyone." All those nonsensical people you need not even think of.

01:02:30.447 --> 01:02:35.427
In general, you should say, "I've forgiven everyone," and you'll be very much better off.

01:02:36.167 --> 01:02:40.367
These are the only three conditions, which are very easy - everybody can do it.

01:02:44.187 --> 01:02:51.187
Now, I have to request you, that you have to take out your shoes, if possible, because this Mother Earth really helps us a lot.

01:02:57.847 --> 01:03:03.087
Now those who are sitting on the ground, it's all right but those who are not sitting on the ground, have to know

01:03:03.627 --> 01:03:07.447
that you have to put your -

01:03:14.487 --> 01:03:18.967
you can come in front, if you like, can come in front -

01:03:20.767 --> 01:03:27.927
uh.. put your left foot away from the right because the left side represents

01:03:29.627 --> 01:03:37.187
our power of desire. Now, medical science doesn't make difference between the left lobe and the right lobe of the brain but we do.

01:03:39.947 --> 01:03:47.087
So we have to put the left foot away from the right foot and

01:03:50.307 --> 01:03:56.227
we have to use our left hand to express our pure desire to get Self-realization -

01:03:56.747 --> 01:03:59.707
is to put your left hand like this,

01:04:02.487 --> 01:04:08.307
just like this as he's showing, left hand and the right hand is

01:04:09.187 --> 01:04:13.427
the power of action. So, we'll use our right hand

01:04:13.747 --> 01:04:17.107
to give nourishment to our centers.

01:04:21.387 --> 01:04:27.787
This is to be done only today not all the time. Once you're realized, you don't have to do all this.

01:04:28.007 --> 01:04:35.427
This is just for your realization and also for you to know how you can raise your own Kundalini just now.

01:04:36.987 --> 01:04:44.247
So now, the left hand is towards Me suggesting that you are desirous of having Self-realization

01:04:45.947 --> 01:04:50.167
and the right hand is to be used for your action.

01:04:52.807 --> 01:05:00.807
I've already told you that I respect your freedom and those who do not want to have Self-realization

01:05:01.587 --> 01:05:05.267
should not watch others and sit here.

01:05:05.927 --> 01:05:11.507
They should go and that would be very civil of them, to do. But those who want

01:05:15.407 --> 01:05:20.947
can have it very easily. But

01:05:21.307 --> 01:05:27.387
whatever we get so easily without paying anything, sometimes we do not have respect for that.

01:05:28.547 --> 01:05:34.447
But you don't know, this is the most precious thing to become a Spirit

01:05:34.967 --> 01:05:42.287
and we should really respect the Self-realization and try to expand our awareness.

01:05:44.447 --> 01:05:49.167
So please, put left hand towards Me and now the right hand on your heart.

01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:53.667
In the heart resides the Spirit.

01:06:01.107 --> 01:06:07.487
If you become the Spirit, you become your own guide, your own master, your own guru.

01:06:08.767 --> 01:06:13.367
So, take your right hand in the upper portion of the abdomen

01:06:15.307 --> 01:06:22.967
which is the center of - on the left hand side. We're working only on the left hand side - which is the center of your mastery.

01:06:24.907 --> 01:06:31.387
Then you take your hand in the lower portion of the abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center

01:06:33.567 --> 01:06:41.027
of pure knowledge - knowledge of the Divine laws and how to work them out.

01:06:43.607 --> 01:06:47.447
When you get your Self-realization, you'll find,

01:06:47.667 --> 01:06:52.127
first time you'll feel this All-Pervading power on your finger-tips,

01:06:52.447 --> 01:06:57.687
Also you'll find a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area,

01:06:58.407 --> 01:07:01.847
maybe warm in the beginning but later on cools down.

01:07:03.007 --> 01:07:09.907
So, this power that you get, you should know how to use it

01:07:10.447 --> 01:07:16.647
for your benevolence and for the benevolence of others. This is the pure knowledge.

01:07:17.227 --> 01:07:22.047
Now, please take your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

01:07:25.147 --> 01:07:29.127
and now again on your heart.

01:07:36.827 --> 01:07:43.967
Now you have to put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your hand to your right.

01:07:46.287 --> 01:07:53.507
This center is caught up when you feel guilty and it's a very dangerous thing because

01:07:53.947 --> 01:08:01.447
when this, this center is out of gear, you get a horrible disease called Angina,

01:08:01.907 --> 01:08:09.727
you get spondylitis, also you get very lethargic organs. So please don't feel guilty.

01:08:10.607 --> 01:08:16.087
Now, raise your hand to your forehead across, put your thumb on one side

01:08:16.767 --> 01:08:21.567
and the fingers on the other and press it hard. Now, put it down your head.

01:08:22.507 --> 01:08:26.267
This is the center for forgiving others.

01:08:28.427 --> 01:08:35.467
Now, take this right hand - I'm just showing you now  and then we'll do it and I'll explain to you -

01:08:36.307 --> 01:08:43.767
on the back side of your head. Now, push back your head as far as possible. This is the center,

01:08:45.487 --> 01:08:51.387
without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, only for your satisfaction

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:55.307
you have to ask forgiveness from this All-Pervading power.

01:08:56.827 --> 01:09:04.207
Now, stretch your hand fully - the palm is to stretch fully -

01:09:04.447 --> 01:09:11.747
and put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:09:12.307 --> 01:09:19.707
Now, put down your head as far as possible, now press it hard, your scalp, by pushing out

01:09:20.047 --> 01:09:28.687
your fingers outward. Now, this is very important - push them out and now press it and move your scalp seven times -

01:09:30.167 --> 01:09:35.907
you will know the reason for all this, why seven times you have to move it.

01:09:37.307 --> 01:09:43.047
Press your scalp and put down your head -

01:09:43.527 --> 01:09:49.127
clockwise, move it clockwise, seven times. That's all you have to do, that's all.

01:10:00.927 --> 01:10:07.447
Now, we have to close the eyes. You can take away your spectacles,

01:10:07.867 --> 01:10:11.507
please see that your both the feet are away from each other.

01:10:12.607 --> 01:10:19.807
If there's anything tight on your neck too much or on your waist, you can loosen it little bit and you have to be comfortable,

01:10:20.187 --> 01:10:27.067
not to slouch nor to stretch too much but in a comfortable state, way, you have to sit down.

01:10:29.447 --> 01:10:36.407
Now, please put the left hand towards Me, right hand on your heart and close your eyes.

01:10:36.867 --> 01:10:41.187
Here, you have to ask Me a question in your heart -

01:10:41.647 --> 01:10:47.447
you may call Me Mother or you may call Me Shri Mataji, whatever you feel like.

01:10:48.047 --> 01:10:54.827
Ask a question in your heart, three times - a very fundamental question about yourself

01:10:55.067 --> 01:10:58.307
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:10:58.527 --> 01:11:04.347
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" ask this question three times in your heart.

01:11:26.927 --> 01:11:33.527
If you are the Spirit, you are your master. So please, put your right hand

01:11:33.767 --> 01:11:39.827
on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it with your fingers - not very hard.

01:11:40.367 --> 01:11:48.367
Here you ask another fundamental question in your heart, three times, "Mother, am I my own master?"

01:11:49.787 --> 01:11:52.947
With full confidence ask this question.

01:12:02.227 --> 01:12:07.927
Again, I cannot cross over your freedom - I respect it

01:12:08.307 --> 01:12:13.667
and I cannot force pure knowledge on you - you have to ask for it.

01:12:14.127 --> 01:12:21.327
So, please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard.

01:12:22.287 --> 01:12:25.627
on the left hand side. Here

01:12:27.407 --> 01:12:32.187
please say six times because this center has got six petals.

01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:42.167
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge. Mother, please give me pure knowledge," ask this six times.

01:12:52.187 --> 01:12:58.567
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts moving upward.

01:13:01.167 --> 01:13:04.127
So now,

01:13:05.247 --> 01:13:10.407
with full confidence you have to open your higher centers.

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:16.667
Please, raise your right hand on the left hand side

01:13:17.127 --> 01:13:21.087
of your abdomen in the upper portion and press it hard.

01:13:23.487 --> 01:13:29.747
Here, you have to say with full confidence, ten times,

01:13:30.947 --> 01:13:36.267
"Mother, I am my own master." Say it with full confidence,

01:13:37.307 --> 01:13:45.107
complete self-confidence. "Mother, I am my own master." You have to say it ten times.

01:13:50.867 --> 01:13:56.847
We have to know that we are not this body, this mind,

01:13:57.347 --> 01:14:03.847
this intellect, emotions, conditionings, ego

01:14:04.507 --> 01:14:08.267
but we are pure Spirit.

01:14:10.387 --> 01:14:16.887
This is the fundamental truth about yourself. So now, please raise your right hand

01:14:17.647 --> 01:14:23.447
on your heart and with full confidence say, twelve times,

01:14:23.947 --> 01:14:29.507
please say it twelve times, "Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

01:14:29.947 --> 01:14:34.447
Please say it twelve times, "Mother, I am the,

01:14:34.707 --> 01:14:38.867
I am the pure Spirit," twelve times, please.

01:14:49.947 --> 01:14:57.127
Another thing we have to know that this All-Pervading power of God's love,

01:14:57.667 --> 01:15:03.687
is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of compassion and bliss

01:15:04.027 --> 01:15:11.347
but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes we might have committed

01:15:11.647 --> 01:15:17.627
can be easily dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness.

01:15:18.167 --> 01:15:24.747
So, please forgive yourself and now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

01:15:26.067 --> 01:15:30.587
push it as far back as possible and turn your head to your right.

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:35.667
Here, you have to say sixteen times,

01:15:38.627 --> 01:15:44.867
with full confidence, "Mother, I am not guilty at all."

01:15:47.567 --> 01:15:50.567
Please say it sixteen times.

01:15:52.267 --> 01:15:56.847
You don't judge yourself, let your Kundalini judge.

01:15:58.127 --> 01:16:05.087
"Mother, I am not guilty at all," please say it sixteen times.

01:16:05.407 --> 01:16:10.287
This center has the maximum number of petals - sixteen petals.

01:16:10.607 --> 01:16:17.287
This center looks after your ear, nose, throat, face, everything, your tongue, your eyes.

01:16:27.387 --> 01:16:31.887
I have already told you whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything

01:16:32.187 --> 01:16:36.347
but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands

01:16:38.507 --> 01:16:45.967
so, in general, you have to forgive everyone not remembering anyone of the people who have troubled you.

01:16:46.787 --> 01:16:49.967
Now, raise your right hand

01:16:50.687 --> 01:16:55.867
on your forehead, across, put your thumb on one side

01:16:57.807 --> 01:17:02.347
and fingers on the other. Now press it hard.

01:17:03.247 --> 01:17:06.587
Please bend your head as far as possible.

01:17:08.967 --> 01:17:13.707
Here, without thinking of anybody else

01:17:14.547 --> 01:17:20.727
just, in general, you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:17:22.487 --> 01:17:30.047
or, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general." Say it from your heart, not how many times but from your heart.

01:17:44.007 --> 01:17:50.187
Now, please take your hand on the back side of your head and push it back as far as possible.

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:59.647
Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to say

01:18:02.387 --> 01:18:08.347
with full confidence, "Oh Divine power, please forgive me

01:18:09.067 --> 01:18:14.747
if I have done anything wrong against you knowingly or unknowingly.

01:18:15.647 --> 01:18:22.187
"Oh Divine power, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong against you

01:18:22.347 --> 01:18:30.147
knowingly or unknowingly." This you're going to say for your satisfaction from your heart - not how many times.

01:18:40.227 --> 01:18:45.347
Now the last center which is very important. Please stretch your hand

01:18:51.027 --> 01:18:58.467
and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood.

01:19:03.527 --> 01:19:09.087
Please put down your head as far as possible, push back your fingers.

01:19:17.427 --> 01:19:25.387
Please push back your fingers, put a good pressure on your scalp. Here again, I respect your freedom -

01:19:26.407 --> 01:19:32.507
I cannot force Self-realization on you so you have to say seven times,

01:19:32.867 --> 01:19:38.827
"Mother, please give me Self-realization, my second birth,"

01:19:40.007 --> 01:19:46.187
and you just move your scalp, very slowly, seven times,  saying that.

01:19:51.507 --> 01:19:55.727
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:19:56.507 --> 01:20:00.767
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:20:02.087 --> 01:20:07.887
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE] Push back your fingers, push back, push back your fingers other there's no pressure.

01:20:08.107 --> 01:20:14.967

01:20:15.267 --> 01:20:18.367
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:20:18.807 --> 01:20:22.807
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:20:23.307 --> 01:20:27.367
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:20:27.607 --> 01:20:31.307
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:20:31.607 --> 01:20:36.827
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

01:20:37.307 --> 01:20:43.987
Now, please take down your hands. Put both the hands towards Me, like this.

01:20:45.307 --> 01:20:51.387
Open your eyes, you can wear your spectacles also. Put both the hands towards Me, like this.

01:20:52.307 --> 01:21:00.027
Now, put the right hand towards Me, like this, put down your head and see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot

01:21:00.747 --> 01:21:03.687
breeze like waves coming from your head.

01:21:04.787 --> 01:21:10.547
Bend your head and see for yourself. Don't put your hand on top of your head, away from it.

01:21:10.787 --> 01:21:17.507
Some people get it far away, some get it nearer. Just see, if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming inside.

01:21:26.527 --> 01:21:30.027
Now, please put the left hand towards Me

01:21:33.087 --> 01:21:39.107
and bend your head and see for yourself now

01:21:40.007 --> 01:21:45.367
with the right hand, if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

01:21:53.267 --> 01:21:57.827
Again with the right hand, please try again with the right hand.

01:22:07.147 --> 01:22:11.287
See yourself, if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming.

01:22:15.147 --> 01:22:20.127
Now, raise your both the hands towards the sky, like this

01:22:23.887 --> 01:22:31.727
and ask a question, three times, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:22:34.247 --> 01:22:39.707
Or you can ask, "Mother, is this the All-Pervading power of God's love?"

01:22:40.767 --> 01:22:48.167
Or you can ask, "Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya?" Ask anyone of these questions. These are the names of only one

01:22:48.587 --> 01:22:56.407
thing which is the All-Pervading power of Divine love which does all the living work.

01:22:56.947 --> 01:23:00.147
Just ask anyone of these questions, three times

01:23:02.947 --> 01:23:10.907
Push back your head towards the sky. Please, put down your hands now.

01:23:13.127 --> 01:23:16.227
Just put the hands like this.

01:23:20.147 --> 01:23:26.447
You can become thoughtless, you can watch Me without thinking. Just put [UNCLEAR]

01:23:27.667 --> 01:23:33.087
Now, those who have felt - please put down your hands

01:23:34.547 --> 01:23:37.987
Put your hands like this. Now,

01:23:39.967 --> 01:23:47.327
those who have felt cool or warm or hot breeze like waves

01:23:47.567 --> 01:23:51.747
on the fingers, on the hands

01:23:51.987 --> 01:23:57.247
or out of the fontanel bone area please raise both your hands.

01:24:03.467 --> 01:24:08.347
So, that's it! May God bless you!

01:24:08.607 --> 01:24:13.047
Everyone seems to have got it except for very few people who haven't.

01:24:14.287 --> 01:24:20.487
Very few didn't get it - doesn't matter, you'll get it tomorrow, it's all right.

01:24:21.107 --> 01:24:27.427
You shouldn't doubt, that's the main point is the doubting and you should forgive, most of you.

01:24:28.267 --> 01:24:33.647
Except for 3-4 people, I think, most of you have got it so, May god bless you!.

01:24:35.367 --> 01:24:40.227
I hope to see you tomorrow again and tomorrow

01:24:40.467 --> 01:24:44.527
I'll meet all of you, individually, all of you.

01:24:45.007 --> 01:24:52.027
Now, you have to inform your friends and everyone, that they should come and we should have more people

01:24:54.007 --> 01:24:59.487
because I'm here only for tomorrow and then I'll come back after two years,

01:24:59.687 --> 01:25:06.187
one year. I shouldn't say two years, will  be too much. All right, so I would request you

01:25:06.427 --> 01:25:12.867
that you should inform your friends, you should inform your relations

01:25:13.207 --> 01:25:16.507
because this is the only thing you can give it to them.

01:25:17.767 --> 01:25:21.347
Now, you have reached a state where you are thoughtless,

01:25:21.647 --> 01:25:28.707
so don't argue with people who haven't got it. Those who haven't got it will also get it tomorrow and those who have got it,

01:25:29.427 --> 01:25:34.027
should know that you have to maintain it - like keeping the peace in your heart

01:25:34.427 --> 01:25:37.827
and not arguing about it and quarreling with others

01:25:38.067 --> 01:25:43.207
because those who won't get it will start saying something - doesn't matter, makes no difference.

01:25:43.527 --> 01:25:49.507
You have got it, so keep your experience with yourself and we have to share it with others, so many

01:25:49.767 --> 01:25:52.747
in Melbourne. May God bless you!

01:25:53.587 --> 01:25:55.907
Tomorrow
