00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:55.159
Today it's a great day for us, for all the
Sahaja Yogis that on this day, I would say

00:00:55.159 --> 00:01:16.230
we are late by one day or two days, the Sahasrara
was opened out.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:34.119
It was just a miracle I should say because
I didn't think that I am at a point where

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.340
it could be done.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:56.840
So I wanted to wait but some things happened
that made Me think that it has to be open.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:09.039
It was 
in such a situation that I felt if I delayed

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:23.100
any more now, it may help these false gurus
to spread their nonsense all over.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:37.570
This is just I should say, is a Sahaj way
of doing things.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.410
Now 25 years have passed.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:53.290
You all have gathered during this time, and
we have so many others who are not here, who

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.349
have achieved so many things.

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:09.450
But perhaps, we are not aware as to what we
have achieved in the real sense of the word.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.409
You've got your vibrations.

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:18.200
You can feel this All Pervading Power.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.739
You are as they say, swimming in the ocean
of joy.

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:33.099
You are all enjoying the collectivity, and
that you have transcended many of your limitations.

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:45.019
All this has happened to you because it is
your right to have it.

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.720
I don't take any credit for it.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:58.129
Only thing all the time I've been pointing
it out to you one thing that now, you have

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:06.459
entered into the Kingdom of God, and enjoy
yourself.

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.480
We have to see around ourselves.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:20.700
The whole nature enjoys itself; doesn't bother,
doesn't bother about anything.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.050
They haven't got realization.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.110
They haven't felt the Paramachaitanya.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.120
But how is it they know that we have to enjoy?

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:42.280
The flowers that come out for a short time
and fade out, but as long as they live, they're

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.280
very happy.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.870
They don't think of their past or of their
future, but they enjoy the present.

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:57.290
And in the present, they enjoy what is - that
they are fragrant and giving fragrance to

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.290
others.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.010
They're beautiful and they are soothing others.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.870
The whole nature is like that.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:18.180
If you look at the birds or anything that
we call as natural is all sort of in a meditative

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.180
mood.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.760
All these hills, and big, big mountains.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:32.630
They look as if they are witness to whatever
has been happening.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:41.870
Now we have to really first look back what
we have achieved.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:53.340
That is important, because if you're climbing
up on a hill, if you look back, you get a

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.330
shock and you may fall down.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.230
So normally people say, never look back.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:09.659
But a person who has earned some treasure,
he again and again goes and counts it and

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:17.370
finds out how much he has got, and every time
he sees that, he enjoys.

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:26.589
So to know relatively what we have got and
how we have achieved something will definitely

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:36.760
give you greater strength of mind and richness
of life.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.770
The first thing that has happened to you I
would say it is very important is this - that

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:48.610
you have felt this All Pervading Power.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:58.280
That shows that you must have been great seekers
of truth, honest, sincere, sensible.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:12.159
That just coming to My program you felt the
vibrations, and after that you started settling

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:14.219
down into it.

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:22.029
So many of you have felt it suddenly, and
they were amazed and they were shocked and

00:07:22.029 --> 00:07:28.520
surprised, and they wanted to test whether
it is true or not.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:37.500
But then you were confident, you found it
that you've got definitely a new dimension

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:47.460
in your life, and that you are feeling this
All Pervading Power of Divine Love.

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:54.120
I'll take one lecture sufficient to describe
this All Pervading Power.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:08:01.990
But what you got out of it is the essence
of it, one has to know, is a complete freedom.

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.490
You have achieved your complete freedom.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:17.190
First of all, the freedom has come to you,
first of all, most important, is from your

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.630
ego.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.400
This wall of ego you have crossed.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:36.700
You have got out of the bondage of this ego,
which was really so much full of problems

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.930
for you.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:43.940
So many things this ego does of which you
are not aware.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:50.130
Firstly, a person who is egoist doesn't mind
hurting anyone.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:56.700
He hurts, but if he's hurt, he doesn't like
it.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.440
Immediately start crying.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:06.200
Specially I've seen people who have too much
ego are very easily hurt, but they don't understand

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:18.920
how many people they have hurt already, and
how many are really frightened of such a person.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.569
So you got rid of your ego.

00:09:22.569 --> 00:09:31.480
It is sinful to hurt any other human being
for anything; for whatever may be the reason

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.649
that you feel you should hurt another one.

00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:42.190
The first is the revenge; the idea of revenge
is there, that I must take a revenge on the

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:53.439
person who has hurt me or has done some wrong
to me or something of that kind.

00:09:53.439 --> 00:09:56.910
This idea of revenge comes when you react.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.459
Some react very violently.

00:09:58.459 --> 00:10:06.750
I have seen people murdering each other in
the name of revenge, killing their own kith

00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:13.759
and kin, killing their fellow men, their country
men, all over the world is some sort of a

00:10:13.759 --> 00:10:19.040
stupid idea of revenge.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:27.500
But if you go to the subtle side of revenge,
what is it?

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.820
What revenge have you taken?

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.480
Supposing there is somebody who has troubled
you.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:38.250
You are angry with that person and you have
killed that person, so you have actually saved

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.250
him.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:46.370
He won't have to suffer from guilty conscience,
it won't have to do anything, it's just finished.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.529
What is the revenge is?

00:10:48.529 --> 00:10:58.750
The revenge should be only by which a person
gets out of his idea of killing others.

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:05.899
Like a sword never fights a sword, it fights
the shield.

00:11:05.899 --> 00:11:18.040
In the same way, the revenge that we think
we can take on another person is not a revenge,

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:25.470
because any action you take in the name of
revenge comes back to you and hurts you much

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:26.470
more.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:32.329
So many things can happen if a person in the
name of revenge starts acting.

00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:38.009
Now for example, these days you know in the
whole world, there's so much of revenge going

00:11:38.009 --> 00:11:47.680
on, even in the name of God; taking revenge
because certain people are following some

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:53.959
religion, or they are doing something else
that you are doing.

00:11:53.959 --> 00:12:01.009
Working out this kind of a revenge, what has
happening is that you are just killing people,

00:12:01.009 --> 00:12:07.959
destroying them, who do not even understand
what sort of a revenge you are taking.

00:12:07.959 --> 00:12:13.949
People are putting bombs and putting all kinds
of things and by that thousands of innocent

00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:19.160
people one is killing; so what kind of a revenge
have you taken?

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.959
They don't deserve any revenge.

00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:31.060
So this revenge when it explodes can destroy
so many innocent people and it will definitely

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.180
react on you.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:36.180
You cannot get away with it.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:42.079
It's a very long process of this revenge.

00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:52.960
I've told you about Bermuda Triangle what
they say, that so many blacks were taken slaves

00:12:52.960 --> 00:13:00.309
and were drowned in that area, so their spirits
they are saying, are haunting on the people

00:13:00.309 --> 00:13:04.540
who are passing by; mostly the whites and
they just drowned.

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:11.990
So it's a very long process, and all that
I need not discuss at this auspicious occasion,

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:19.470
but I have to say that when we take a revenge,
every action has a reaction.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:29.389
So somehow you have got out of that idea of
revenge, just out of that idea.

00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:37.230
There's another thing that if you don't take
revenge, and leave it to God, It acts.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:47.279
It acts, not only that, but a Divine Power
takes into Its own control how to really give

00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:56.809
a good lesson to that person or to that community
or to that kind of organization which is taking

00:13:56.809 --> 00:14:00.800
a revenge on you.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.050
You don't have to worry.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:10.680
I'll have to tell you that in this 25 years
I've seen, people have been extremely unkind

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.540
to me.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:19.300
Many organizations, many so called religions,
and all kinds of things have been after us.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.189
Media has been after us.

00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:24.610
Take the example of French media.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:33.399
They tried to trouble us so much and tried
to bring bad name to us, doesn't matter.

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:40.830
The media people now, three of them who went
to India, are now under warrant and if they

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:45.499
go to India, they will be arrested.

00:14:45.499 --> 00:14:46.959
I didn't do anything.

00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:50.360
We didn't do anything.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:59.050
Secondly, the same media, I mean the same
newspapers are all bankrupt.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.689
You didn't do anything about it.

00:15:00.689 --> 00:15:01.939
You didn't go and say that they should become
bankrupt.

00:15:01.939 --> 00:15:04.100
You didn't take any revenge.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.730
Why should we?

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:08.980
Why should we take any revenge?

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:16.079
Because we are not bothered as to what happens;
we are not bothered as to what these people

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:18.610
have done to us.

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:26.180
But legally they are now involved in such
a way that they are under warrant and if they

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:29.160
go to India, they'll be arrested.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:36.480
And the whole of French government is with
them, all of them are trying so much, but

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.089
this punishment is on their head.

00:15:40.089 --> 00:15:47.420
In their lifetime, they didn't have to die
or anything; in their lifetime they have got

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.420
it.

00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:56.689
So you have got this special power that you
don't have to take revenge or you have to

00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:57.790
just forgive.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:06.220
Just forgive and the forgiveness will look
after the whole arrangement of how to bring

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:12.029
the other person to its proper path.

00:16:12.029 --> 00:16:22.019
So once you are out of this idea of revenge,
you really feel very peaceful, extremely peaceful

00:16:22.019 --> 00:16:27.269
because this peace that you have within yourself
is not unnatural, it's not mental, but its

00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:28.269
just happens to you.

00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:29.269
It's all right.

00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:34.329
So what if they have said, they have done
anything wrong to us?

00:16:34.329 --> 00:16:37.579
Why should we bother?

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:43.649
So many things are there which I can tell
you have worked out automatically.

00:16:43.649 --> 00:16:54.259
Now in Turkey they told Me that there is some
boy who is from England and he went and told

00:16:54.259 --> 00:16:59.689
the media something against Sahaja Yoga and
it was all published.

00:16:59.689 --> 00:17:05.339
But in the court he confessed that, "Whatever
I said was wrong."

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:09.300
Nobody went and told him, nobody threatened
him, nothing happened.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:16.920
So from your point of view you must understand,
that you're not going to get into any mess

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:31.340
of taking revenge of any kind, because you
belong to the Government of God.

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:36.540
And this Government is extremely alert, very
genuine and also extremely efficient.

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:42.300
And as far as you are concerned, you are a
citizen of that Great Kingdom.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:50.620
So what you have achieved is the citizenship
of this great Kingdom of God where you should

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.050
feel absolutely secured.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:58.320
The man who is secure is never afraid, never
afraid.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:04.080
So you have also got rid of your fear.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:09.920
Man is in the - I don't know why he's afraid
of this and afraid of that, and worries about

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:13.130
this and worries about that.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:20.400
It's something surprising how they worry about
their health, worry about their family, their

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:26.490
children, their house, I mean all sorts of
things.

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:30.180
But Sahaja Yogis don't, they don't.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.910
We have no worry.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.080
It all works out.

00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:36.260
Why should we worry?

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.530
That instrument of worry is over.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:42.830
It's finished; I think it's gone out of order.

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:52.150
And what you are now in a state where you
just have no time to worry, because you are

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.390
enjoying yourself.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:19:05.260
This fear I have seen in people works so much
that so many diseases people get out of fear,

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:11.780
so many diseases, specially most of these
left sided diseases people get out of fear.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.300
What is there to fear?

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:19.480
This is like you beat the Mother Earth saying
that there's a snake.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:25.750
There's no snake, but you may just feel that
way and you may go on with this fear.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:38.040
Anybody, any kind of a idea about a phantom
or someone or some sort of a big devil standing

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.020
somewhere; it is all nonsense.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.470
For you, it doesn't exist.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:48.650
Say in the darkness you are walking so you
see forms and things and some people say I

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:53.470
saw one on a tree, one some sort of a form;
it doesn't exist actually, it doesn't exist.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:59.540
But this fear in man makes him think like
that.

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:05.660
He's afraid of this and afraid of that, and
then as a result, he loses his freedom.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:13.330
He becomes slave, slave to so many people
he's afraid of - that such and such man will

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:21.620
harm me, such and such man will trouble Me,
and the whole concept of fear has ruined our

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.620
family lives.

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:31.360
For example, a wife is dominating, husband
is dominating, there's nothing to fear, nothing

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.360
to fear.

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.340
By fear only you play into their hands.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.450
So supposing the wife is dominating, just
make fun out of it.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:46.130
If you cannot make the fun in the presence
of say your wife or your husband, better make

00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:47.130
it outside.

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.670
Take it, "Oh look at that."

00:20:49.670 --> 00:21:00.320
It is your special quality now that you can
really get rid of your fear completely.

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.750
What is there to be afraid of wife or afraid
of husband?

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:06.570
What can he do to you?

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:11.390
At the most he'll kill you, so what, you are
going to die in anyway.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:17.370
So the fear of death is another nonsense people
have.

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:24.490
First time when I started My work everywhere
they asked Me, "What about death?"

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:29.590
I said, but just now you are living; why are
you asking, "What about death?"

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:33.870
So many people ask Me question, "What about
our death"; with why do you want to know about

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:34.870
it?

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.390
I'll tell you what about today, just now.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:45.220
So this is another mad idea - that we should
know about our death, what's going to happen,

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.220
and whatever happens.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:48.840
Once you are dead you are finished.

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.780
You don't have to do anything after that.

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:56.690
So what's the use of knowing when, when you
will die, what will happen to you?

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:58.840
Whatever has to happen will happen.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:02.180
We never ask, that when I sleep what will
happen to me, do we?

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:07.800
And this is a permanent sleep and we worry
so much about it that we should know what

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.280
will happen after death.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:15.950
One has to die at the time whenever it has
to die, because whatever is born has to be

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.760
dead.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:25.880
But you do know that you have got eternal
life.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.420
You can never die.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:40.740
Death is not this body disappearing; death
is where you are absolutely without any control

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:43.330
of your soul live.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:53.310
Once you are a realized soul you have all
the control, all the powers: to take your

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:59.370
soul wherever you feel like, to be born if
you like; if you don't want you will not be

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:07.560
born, to be born with the people in the families,
in the communities wherever you like.

00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:14.260
There are many great souls I know that have
taken birth daringly into societies which

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:22.150
are very much, I should say, deteriorating
and are in danger of getting destroyed because

00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:24.760
of stupidity they do.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:39.789
So this happening, that we are afraid of death,
is absolutely absurd for Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:43.270
What is there to think even about your death?

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:50.590
There is nothing like death for you because
you have got eternal life.

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:54.700
It's not that you continue with the same body.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:24:01.110
You may go on changing your dress but you
are living, you are aware, and you know even

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:08.770
if this body is not there-you will be there;
all the time, available for Sahaja Yoga, for

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:14.320
anything that is to be done in the name of
reality.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:27.620
So you must know your position as eternal
being what is your work, what is your idea,

00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.070
what you have to do.

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:40.050
So one has to get rid of this idea of death
because death doesn't exist for you.

00:24:40.050 --> 00:24:41.320
It's finished.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:49.150
Moreover, all such people who are afraid of
their death go on having insurances, this,

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:53.070
that, all headaches, see, and ultimately what
happens?

00:24:53.070 --> 00:25:00.340
All these worldly things you leave here and
you depart.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:11.360
There is I don't think anybody could carry
even a little dust with that soul which is

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.490
departing.

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:20.840
But in your case, when you people are no more
on this earth so called, then you don't carry

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.660
all this material things because you have
already given up.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.680
You have no interest in them.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:35.780
You're not materialistic so your spirit is
free, and when you die what happens to you

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:42.060
is a very simple thing - that you feel very
liberated, absolutely.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:52.690
And then you feel your freedom completely,
and you can decide what you want to do.

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:58.450
It's all under your own guidance, your own
desire; everything works out.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:04.920
You don't feel that you have come out of your
body, and this is what should tell you that

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:13.850
there should be no fear of death, but on the
contrary - it should be welcomed.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:21.780
Because you will feel much more liberated,
much more at ease.

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:27.140
You don't have other problems that you have
to in any case carry on in this world so because

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.270
of this body.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:35.370
Now see I have to take some medicines, I have
to take vitamins; don't have to take anything,

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:36.370
don't need it.

00:26:36.370 --> 00:26:38.650
This body's finished is a very good idea.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:45.730
They're so troublesome it is you see.

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:51.350
All the time despite the fact that you may
say that, "Oh I don't care for this body,"

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:52.700
and all that, but this body won't leave you.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:59.360
This is the most sticky thing we have is our
body.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:09.710
So to forget about death should be the easiest
thing for you.

00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:13.260
We have broken many walls.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:23.690
As you know very well that the conditionings
we had, we have finished that.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.310
It's very surprising.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:33.130
I've seen people when they get their realization,
immediately after that they start seeing around

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:34.130
them.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:39.780
They'll immediately tell you what's wrong
with their religion, then they'll tell you

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:44.820
what's wrong with their country; what's wrong
with their culture.

00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.890
It's through them I have come to know so much.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:51.340
I didn't know that this was so, but they themselves
told us.

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:57.850
Now for example there's a French man, take
it - if a Frenchman gets realization, I mean

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:01.200
you know everything about French.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:05.940
The things you could never even imagine what
sort of people they are; they will tell you

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:06.940
everything.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:09.540
Same with the English I've seen.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:16.650
English they may, they laugh at themselves
all right, but actually when they become realized

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:22.900
souls you see, they give you a complete picture
of English people: what sort of people are

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:26.760
there, what's wrong with them, how they are
egoistical, this, that.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.760
I was amazed.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:32.930
I mean, I, I, I never knew so many things
which I came to know through Sahaja Yogis

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:34.720
who got realization.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.970
Because they have seen all these things very
thoroughly and very closely and they knew

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:43.950
what was it.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:56.220
Now when you become so cleaned, washed out
completely, mind completely cleaned out from

00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:04.630
all kinds of conditionings you see; you become
like a mirror, beautiful mirror.

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:11.760
And in that mirror one can see complete picture
of the society in which you live, the complete

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:18.340
picture of the government which rules you;
everything, so clear-cut.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.450
And it is absolute.

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:20.740
It is not biased.

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:25.180
For example you ask somebody, then he will
say, "What is your politics?"

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:29.830
If I say My politics is I have no politics,
say, "What you have no politics, how can we

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.090
exist without politics?"

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:32.710
I have no politics.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:42.350
So they will go on asking questions to you
which are very much unknown.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:48.580
But for a realized soul, it's just the other
way round.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:57.020
Hes not only sees, but also shows and expresses,
very clearly.

00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:07.560
I've been amazed at the way people have been
really so reflective of the society into which

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:12.030
they live and the country which they represent.

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:16.100
So the identification is lost, complete identification
is lost.

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:19.020
You don't feel identified much.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.500
You just see what's wrong with that world.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:29.510
Then also another point is that you start
seeing how you can help, what you should do,

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.960
how you can work it out.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:38.020
And the importance of that becomes your main
thing in life.

00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:43.680
Everybody I see, yesterday the way you brought
all this flags and all that, behind that flag,

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:49.800
I could see, all of you wanted that peace
should prevail in those countries, they should

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.910
get all the joy and beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:53.910 --> 00:30:55.970
It's what a feeling it is.

00:30:55.970 --> 00:31:01.430
It's not like yourself becoming Sahaja Yogis
and sitting in the corner, no.

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:09.680
They want to do it for that country about
which they are not identified, but without

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:16.670
identification, they have that deep feeling
that they have to work out; correct it.

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:21.270
It's a very different type of personality
you develop.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:27.490
Normally you see if you say a word against
somebody that, "See in your country they do

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:28.490
like this.."

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:31.100
"Oh what you're talking, what about your country?"

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.100
Immediately.

00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:33.980
They'll never accept.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:42.800
If you just try to even say one word against
them, their country or their government, which

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:46.430
may be the most rotten government, but no
still, "What?

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:49.140
We are all right."

00:31:49.140 --> 00:32:00.180
That kind of stupid identification, which
keeps you completely glued to that society;

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:04.070
like some people will say, "No, no, I have
to go to the pub."

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.760
I say, why?

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.200
Why you have to go to the pub?

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.630
"That's our society; that's our culture.

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:10.630
We have to go.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:18.230
We have to go to the pub, get drunk and fall
down, all of us together.

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:20.350
That's the sort of thing we are; we can't
help it you see.

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:21.350
This is what it is."

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:25.680
You tell anybody that, why do you do this
like this?

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.300
What is the need to do?

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:33.350
"Now, because I have to live in this society,
after all, after all I belong to this society

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:37.610
and I just can't do what I like."

00:32:37.610 --> 00:32:40.510
But when you get your realization, you can
do what you like.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:47.880
You can do what you like, because you only
like that is righteous, that is good, that

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.230
is constructive, that is helpful.

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:54.890
So you can do whatever you like; after realization,
there's no restriction for you.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:59.740
All these restriction of, "don't, don't, don't,
don't" - these clearly enslave you.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:03.700
I think it very much enslaves you.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:09.680
But in after realization, you are such a free
bird that nothing can enslave you.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:14.730
For example, there are many preachers who
preach - you shouldn't drink, you should not

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:24.780
smoke, this, shouldn't take drugs, you should
do this, you should do that - but it doesn't

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.780
stop.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:26.780
It doesn't help.

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:30.280
People struggle, try everything, ultimately
they commit suicides, but they can't get rid

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:36.160
of those habits; while now you are so powerful
that nothing can stick to you.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:42.770
That's the purity of your character that has
come up; it doesn't allow any nonsensical

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:44.760
things to stick to you.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:52.110
I've heard of so many Sahaja Yogis telling
me, how their eyes have steadied down, how

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:58.300
they have become so righteous, how they have
become so pure and they can't understand.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:03.430
They said, "Mother is it Your power, Your
purity You have given us, or it is our purity

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:04.430
You have awakened?"

00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:05.430
Of course yours.

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:06.430
No doubt.

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:14.010
All these things you have, and you become
aware of it, and thus you get absolutely misidentified

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:21.440
I should say with all these nonsensical things,
and you don't like it.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.139
You just don't like it.

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:24.540
And you go on criticizing.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:33.440
I've been to all these countries also before,
and I have met people who are very much identified,

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:39.720
and diplomatically I was not suppose to say
anything whatsoever that would make them feel

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:42.540
that they are doing something wrong.

00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:48.940
But after Sahaja Yoga, the same people are
telling us and making fun of the whole thing.

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:51.409
For example, I've heard some Sahaja Yogis
talking to each other.

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:57.170
He says, "You see my country, this is so stupid
thing going on."

00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:02.390
Another one said, "Nobody can beat mine; it's
much worse."

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:14.099
Is a very common competition among Sahaja
Yogis going on.

00:35:14.099 --> 00:35:31.549
So that we have to see how pure we have become,
and in this purity anything that is dirty,

00:35:31.549 --> 00:35:39.740
murky, anything that will spoil this purity;
we don't like it.

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.180
We don't like it.

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:51.749
We are washed, cleaned, from inside, and won't
want to take anything like that within us

00:35:51.749 --> 00:35:52.749
anymore.

00:35:52.749 --> 00:35:59.930
Then I've seen also, the way people have become
so compassionate.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:06.250
Is very surprising how they have become compassionate
to each other.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:14.700
For example, there were two Sahaja Yogis,
they were not very happy with each other,

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.599
not compatible; whatever you say that is.

00:36:17.599 --> 00:36:23.720
And I didn't know how to make them feel that,
"You see the other Sahaja Yogi's all right;

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.750
doesn't matter after all, what is."

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.900
"No I don't like this thing in him."

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:32.650
And the another one would say, "I don't like
this thing about him."

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:36.580
So it went on: "I don't like," he says, "I
don't like."

00:36:36.580 --> 00:36:43.180
I mean they were seeing each other's defects
or whatever you may call them.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:49.539
So I said, "All right now will you meditate
for some time?"

00:36:49.539 --> 00:36:51.900
Again, "Meditate, meditate."

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.269
And I said, "Now, do you love me?"

00:36:56.269 --> 00:37:00.519
She said I, one says, "I love You more than
he loves."

00:37:00.519 --> 00:37:06.200
I said, "Is difficult situation."

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:19.119
How to make them understand now that you cannot
weigh your love; you cannot make a chart out

00:37:19.119 --> 00:37:20.119
of it.

00:37:20.119 --> 00:37:27.920
It is something within yourself, and if you
love somebody then you enjoy it.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:32.250
I mean you cannot qualify it; you cannot quantify
it.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:40.660
But this was going on with these two gentlemen
together, and I thought, "Now what to do?"

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:46.940
They are very important, and still there's
no understanding between the two.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:51.450
So the Divine Power took over I think.

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:56.490
One of them fell very sick suddenly, very
sick.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:38:02.740
And I had sent word also that, "You'll be
sick; be careful."

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:10.549
But it was I mean they thought that the other
fellow might be trying to be funny or something;

00:38:10.549 --> 00:38:11.880
it was not understood.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:12.880
He was very sick.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:24.710
When he fell sick, then this one, the another
one, felt such tremendous love for him.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:31.130
It's something, nobody can explain, that he
went and sat with that patient for 24 hours,

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:38.289
and said that, "If you need any money, I have
got."

00:38:38.289 --> 00:38:45.369
He paid for wherever he could pay.

00:38:45.369 --> 00:38:54.780
So this gentleman also was very sensible,
reasonable person on his own - felt this love,

00:38:54.780 --> 00:39:02.220
this affection, in this hard taskmaster, the
other one - and such understanding grew up

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:03.279
within them.

00:39:03.279 --> 00:39:13.900
It is I think, is the Divine's Play that they
were brought together, so close and such compassion.

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:21.519
So the force of compassion within you is so
much, it's very subtle; you don't see.

00:39:21.519 --> 00:39:30.059
Because on mental level - I was telling them,
arguing, trying to pacify him, pacify him;

00:39:30.059 --> 00:39:33.390
like that was on - it would not work out.

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:44.970
But when this force of compassion started
acting suddenly into one of them, the another

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:57.730
one saw the compassion, the pure compassion,
and just they became great friends.

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:03.720
So one has to feel the compassion within yourself.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:14.319
I've seen many a times that there are many
Sahaja Yogis and sometimes I have to correct

00:40:14.319 --> 00:40:16.599
them, or say something.

00:40:16.599 --> 00:40:22.180
Immediately, another one will say, "Mother
can You forgive him, You can't forgive?"

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:24.529
I say I have forgiven.

00:40:24.529 --> 00:40:26.869
I am not doing anything.

00:40:26.869 --> 00:40:28.279
"Please forgive, please."

00:40:28.279 --> 00:40:40.859
I feel so happy to hear that, that in one
point, in one condition, when it comes to

00:40:40.859 --> 00:40:48.190
Sahaja Yogi, you support him, even against
Me; I feel happy.

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:55.269
Shows that you are not only generous, but
you are filled with your compassion.

00:40:55.269 --> 00:41:04.849
So this source of compassion which is within
your being, in your heart, you have to just

00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:06.319
open your heart.

00:41:06.319 --> 00:41:11.700
If you open that heart, it's like opening
the Sahasrara.

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:19.490
You'll be amazed how you can forgive people
and you can live with them.

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:25.509
I've reports which disturbs Me many a times
that people are forming different groups,

00:41:25.509 --> 00:41:31.940
and having different ashrams, and they don't
come to the collective, and all that.

00:41:31.940 --> 00:41:34.319
I feel very much concerned.

00:41:34.319 --> 00:41:40.259
Now what is missing is, of course, there are
also some people who think that they must

00:41:40.259 --> 00:41:46.960
have a separate, their own organization, and
why should they be in the collective, and

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:47.960
all that.

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:55.900
So that it is definite, that such a person
has not yet achieved that state of compassion.

00:41:55.900 --> 00:42:10.519
In the state of compassion, you like that
somebody tells you that, "Don't say anything

00:42:10.519 --> 00:42:12.789
to such and such person.

00:42:12.789 --> 00:42:14.890
I don't want you to say this."

00:42:14.890 --> 00:42:18.240
It's very, very joy giving to Me.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:22.999
Like we had one couple, they were quarrelling
throughout.

00:42:22.999 --> 00:42:25.839
They used to send Me letters after letters.

00:42:25.839 --> 00:42:32.720
Ah baba, was fed up; telephones after telephones,
both of them quarrelling.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:39.829
Quarrelling so much, I didn't know what to
do with them.

00:42:39.829 --> 00:42:45.819
So, I thought that it's better that they divorce
and finish it off.

00:42:45.819 --> 00:42:58.170
And I told them, separately, that, "You better
divorce each other and get out of it, but

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:02.859
the complaints you have are such that they
cannot be solved."

00:43:02.859 --> 00:43:03.859
Said, "How?"

00:43:03.859 --> 00:43:12.680
I said, "You are saying that my husband doesn't
give me more time, he is always out, and he

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:20.390
doesn't spend any nice moments with me, we
don't go out and all these complaints are

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:21.390
there.

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:24.839
And the husband says that, she always troubles
me that I must take her out, and I must do

00:43:24.839 --> 00:43:26.849
this, and I must do that.

00:43:26.849 --> 00:43:28.720
I want to do it but I can't do it."

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:33.090
So I said, "But when you take a divorce, you'll
never, can claim anything.

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:36.390
Permanently, the husband is lost and you are
lost.

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:38.579
So why do you want to do such a thing?"

00:43:38.579 --> 00:43:42.430
Immediately, know this compassion started
working, and then I put in a word, "Supposing

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:54.020
any one of you is sick tomorrow, then who
will look after each other?"

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:58.230
This just put them out.

00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:04.380
You know such little, little moments in life,
come in, in the life of Sahaja Yogis I've

00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:13.900
seen, that suddenly this heart opens, and
with that - they combat all these petty, nonsensical,

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:20.529
ideas which keeps them out; out of each other
and out of the collectivity.

00:44:20.529 --> 00:44:27.700
What gives me the greatest enjoyment is to
see how you love each other, care for each

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:32.749
other, joke with each other and dance with
each other.

00:44:32.749 --> 00:44:35.829
This is the greatest thing that I enjoy.

00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:39.519
I don't want to get rid of this idea of Mine.

00:44:39.519 --> 00:44:46.619
Despite the fact, so many times I find it's
hard to believe how could Sahaja Yogis behave

00:44:46.619 --> 00:44:58.430
like this, and try to create rifts, and distances
between the people who are realized souls.

00:44:58.430 --> 00:45:06.029
Because realized souls anywhere in the world,
you should see them, they respect each other.

00:45:06.029 --> 00:45:13.500
Not only respect, cared and never talked ill
of another realized soul.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.500
Never.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:18.680
I don't know if you have known about the private
lives of these saints.

00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:25.849
But in India as we have had so many of them,
when you see them - how they have behaved

00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:35.839
towards each other, the way they have looked
after each other - it's so beautiful; it's

00:45:35.839 --> 00:45:37.059
so noble.

00:45:37.059 --> 00:45:45.480
As if they care for the other Sahaja Yogi,
or yogi, or a realized soul, than for themselves.

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:59.200
And the whole thing makes you feel like in
a new world, of new people, who care for the

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:06.300
feelings of others, and not - what they want
to say, or what they want to have, or they

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.890
are something special.

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:16.289
Also in Sahaja Yoga, you have come; you have
lost your specialities.

00:46:16.289 --> 00:46:21.650
Some of them think they're very special.

00:46:21.650 --> 00:46:31.720
Supposing I call some lady to put say alta
on My Feet, she starts thinking she is very

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:43.660
special, but I just call her because I know
she has a horrible agnya and 

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:44.660
I have to clear it out.

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:48.809
And when somebody told Me, "Mother she thinks
something very special," I said, "Really,

00:46:48.809 --> 00:46:50.029
what makes her think like that?"

00:46:50.029 --> 00:46:54.119
"Because You call her to put some alta on
Your Feet."

00:46:54.119 --> 00:47:02.670
I said I just called her that she has such
a horrid, ugly, agnya that she will trouble

00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:06.970
everyone, so I want to clear it.

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:15.329
So, either I should have told her that you
are a very egoistical, horrible and all the

00:47:15.329 --> 00:47:20.720
words that are possible, otherwise she won't
understand.

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.059
It's so surprising.

00:47:22.059 --> 00:47:30.529
There is one lady who was really very nasty
to her in-laws and everybody in India, and

00:47:30.529 --> 00:47:31.829
she came to see Me.

00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:33.560
I called her.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.759
I actually scolded her.

00:47:35.759 --> 00:47:39.059
I said, "What business you had to behave like
this here?

00:47:39.059 --> 00:47:43.670
Your father who was such a racist, you never
said a word against him, and why are you talking

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:45.559
so much against these people?"

00:47:45.559 --> 00:47:46.700
I scolded her.

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:54.170
She went out and told, "Oh look at Mother
has called me; nobody is allowed to see Her."

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:56.309
I said, "What's this?"

00:47:56.309 --> 00:48:03.279
It's a very funny situation with people I
sometimes feel the way they think they're

00:48:03.279 --> 00:48:06.150
something special, and they should make themselves
special.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:09.400
It is becoming really difficult.

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:22.220
Now just to show My love, to appreciate something
people have done, and if you give some present

00:48:22.220 --> 00:48:29.809
to that person, or you show concern about
that person, because he's done some good work

00:48:29.809 --> 00:48:34.749
or something, he starts thinking he's something
special.

00:48:34.749 --> 00:48:44.000
I mean is an impossible situation, because
I expect that if I have done anything good

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:52.849
to that person, or in any way suggested My
concern about a person - that person has to

00:48:52.849 --> 00:49:02.200
become a very good Sahaja Yogi; in the sense
the most humble, and honest, and loving person.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:05.849
Otherwise it has no meaning.

00:49:05.849 --> 00:49:13.730
No use being good to anyone if that means
that person jumps into hell.

00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:31.329
So this one is also another idea of speciality,
that they have lost their sense of speciality.

00:49:31.329 --> 00:49:41.019
When a drop becomes the ocean, it has become
the ocean, but it's not the drop anymore.

00:49:41.019 --> 00:49:47.410
If anybody thinks, "I am a special person,"
then know that you are no more an ocean; you

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:49.369
are still the drop.

00:49:49.369 --> 00:49:57.089
Because unless and until you are the drop,
how can you feel that "I am something special"?

00:49:57.089 --> 00:50:01.440
So you have lost your speciality.

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:10.210
You have lost it, because all these ideas
of speciality comes from your past.

00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:19.930
One lady I met once, long time back, she was
a very rude, proud, arrogant woman.

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:25.599
So this was in Delhi, where people are very
conscious of their husband's jobs, and this

00:50:25.599 --> 00:50:27.960
and that.

00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:33.970
I didn't even know the destination, or even
the designation of My husband.

00:50:33.970 --> 00:50:40.260
So she was very rude to Me.

00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:43.279
I said what's the matter with you, why are
you so rude, what's the problem?

00:50:43.279 --> 00:50:45.279
She said, "You don't know?

00:50:45.279 --> 00:50:48.739
I'm the wife of such and such."

00:50:48.739 --> 00:50:54.070
You're the wife or the husband?

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:58.890
"I'm the wife of such and such."

00:50:58.890 --> 00:51:04.509
So she asked Me, "What are you doing here?"

00:51:04.509 --> 00:51:05.509
I said, "I am a housewife."

00:51:05.509 --> 00:51:12.420
Then My husband came.

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:16.369
She said, "Do you know him?"

00:51:16.369 --> 00:51:20.249
I said, "Yes I know, why?"

00:51:20.249 --> 00:51:24.579
I thought there must be something wrong there
also.

00:51:24.579 --> 00:51:31.849
So she said, "No I just want to know.

00:51:31.849 --> 00:51:35.910
How do you know him?"

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:39.460
As if I was some criminal or what?

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:40.960
I said, "He's My husband."

00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:45.099
"Oh my God, he's your husband?"

00:51:45.099 --> 00:51:46.479
What happened?

00:51:46.479 --> 00:51:51.289
As if ten serpents had bitten her.

00:51:51.289 --> 00:51:58.499
Maybe, maybe her husband was at a much lower
position than my husband, maybe something

00:51:58.499 --> 00:52:00.869
which I am not conscious of it.

00:52:00.869 --> 00:52:10.670
But this is what is "I'm something special."

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:18.749
This stupid idea of being special has to be
completely negated in Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:18.749 --> 00:52:20.150
Not mentally.

00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:21.190
Not mentally.

00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:32.079
Mentally if you're again saying, "I'm not
special, I'm not special," like a mantra,

00:52:32.079 --> 00:52:37.680
you'll become much more.

00:52:37.680 --> 00:52:45.280
Because you'll say, "I've said this mantra
23,000 times.

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:53.320
Who can say like me?"

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:58.950
So this idea - I'm something special, I'm
something great, I'm something out of the

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:06.640
blue, something superior to others - just
vanishes.

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:13.329
Like as I said, you are a drop in the sea.

00:53:13.329 --> 00:53:21.440
You have become the ocean, but you are no
more a drop, to have any relative value system.

00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.989
There's no relative value system.

00:53:23.989 --> 00:53:32.059
There is no system by which you can say that
I'm higher or he's lower; all that has created

00:53:32.059 --> 00:53:35.220
all the problems of the world.

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:45.119
See from our caste system in India, the social
systems in the West, the racialism in the

00:53:45.119 --> 00:53:55.150
West, also self consciousness of "my religion
is better, yours is worst, we are the best"

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:57.119
- all these things have created problems.

00:53:57.119 --> 00:53:59.650
It has done no good.

00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:03.440
It has failed and failed and failed.

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:12.599
So in Sahaja Yoga at least don't bring this
disease anymore - that, "I'm better, we, our

00:54:12.599 --> 00:54:13.849
country's better..."

00:54:13.849 --> 00:54:22.029
This speciality you should drop, and real
beauty of your personality will show.

00:54:22.029 --> 00:54:28.809
For that you don't need a special scale, you
don't need a special body, you don't need

00:54:28.809 --> 00:54:34.349
a special, what you can call, a glamorous
look.

00:54:34.349 --> 00:54:37.809
What you need is a beautiful heart.

00:54:37.809 --> 00:54:44.170
And I tell you, it's the beautiful heart that
attracts; nothing else.

00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:48.200
It's the beautiful heart that you want to
have.

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:54.039
I've known people nay many like that.

00:54:54.039 --> 00:54:56.859
There was one gentleman who divorced his first
wife.

00:54:56.859 --> 00:55:01.759
She maybe not be so good looking, maybe ugly,
or whatever it was.

00:55:01.759 --> 00:55:08.759
Then he married another good-looking woman,
and he ran away from the house.

00:55:08.759 --> 00:55:10.890
So I asked him why.

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:16.259
You didn't like that woman because she was
ugly or whatever it was, so why have you now

00:55:16.259 --> 00:55:17.970
running away from this one?

00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:19.019
"She has no heart.

00:55:19.019 --> 00:55:26.180
She has no heart."

00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:35.380
And this is what you have - a very great,
generous, beautiful, dharmic heart.

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:44.510
You have got it as a present from the Divine,
and which you must respect.

00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:56.710
Should be proud of it, and enjoy it, as you
should enjoy your generosity.

00:55:56.710 --> 00:56:02.789
You should enjoy the way all this nature is
enjoying itself.

00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:09.680
To be very meticulous about things, to be
all the time correcting others, is a headache.

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:12.980
It's a headache.

00:56:12.980 --> 00:56:18.809
The best thing is to correct yourself, and
laugh at yourself; that's the best way you

00:56:18.809 --> 00:56:19.809
can do it.

00:56:19.809 --> 00:56:24.210
Everybody has some funny things about themselves.

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:27.890
I also have; I must confess.

00:56:27.890 --> 00:56:33.739
And I enjoy them because I think I try and
try, but always I forget.

00:56:33.739 --> 00:56:37.430
For example spectacles, I always forget them.

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:41.059
Before coming see I must always forget it.

00:56:41.059 --> 00:56:46.519
I tell Myself that I need it, I should take
it, must remember; but invariably I forget,

00:56:46.519 --> 00:56:49.869
and I don't know why.

00:56:49.869 --> 00:56:55.869
I, I, I can't do without it, but still I forget.

00:56:55.869 --> 00:56:57.410
There's so many things.

00:56:57.410 --> 00:57:00.489
For example, I don't know how to count money.

00:57:00.489 --> 00:57:04.519
If you may give me 100 rupees, I'll count
it 200 rupees.

00:57:04.519 --> 00:57:09.309
I tell you I, I'm good at mathematics, but
I can't count.

00:57:09.309 --> 00:57:12.460
I don't know how to sign a check; can you
believe it?

00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:13.460
I can't sign.

00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:16.890
You have to write the check for Me, otherwise
I can't.

00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:25.470
And somebody asks Me say for say 100 rupees;
I'll give him a big 500 and forget about it.

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:26.619
And that person says, "Mother You gave me
500."

00:57:26.619 --> 00:57:29.140
No, no, no, I gave you 100 only.

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.219
"No, You gave me 500."

00:57:31.219 --> 00:57:32.819
I went home and found out.

00:57:32.819 --> 00:57:34.319
It's all right.

00:57:34.319 --> 00:57:38.969
After all, if he's dishonest - he's dishonest;
if he's honest - he's honest.

00:57:38.969 --> 00:57:43.671
So why to worry about how much money you gave,
and this thing, that thing, meticulously you

00:57:43.671 --> 00:57:47.400
see, finding everything like this?

00:57:47.400 --> 00:57:50.849
And I've seen with all these meticulous people,
they always fail.

00:57:50.849 --> 00:57:54.549
Because you see this brain plays some tricks
on them.

00:57:54.549 --> 00:58:02.540
For example, there was one fellow who told
Me that, "The size of your car is such and

00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:03.540
such."

00:58:03.540 --> 00:58:04.540
All right then.

00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:12.999
"So the size of the garage will be such and
such."

00:58:12.999 --> 00:58:16.739
I said all right.

00:58:16.739 --> 00:58:20.819
So, when we build the garage, the car won't
get in.

00:58:20.819 --> 00:58:25.910
I said such a meticulous architect, and such
a well-known person who has got so many awards,

00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:29.289
this, that - how could he make such a mistake?

00:58:29.289 --> 00:58:36.509
But I still didn't understand it you see.

00:58:36.509 --> 00:58:42.190
Now he said, "Now you better buy a smaller
car."

00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:45.299
I said at least now you measure this garage
in a proper way, otherwise again if I buy

00:58:45.299 --> 00:58:48.650
something it won't enter in.

00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:53.670
So you see what I'm saying, we are so particular,
so meticulous.

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:57.809
Now see these little, little flowers I see
them here; they're not meticulous.

00:58:57.809 --> 00:59:04.380
They are growing on their own freely, everybody
gets the sun's rays, and they're quite happy.

00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:11.760
But the way we are particular, those people
are very particular, are headaches to themselves.

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:15.279
And then ultimately they find that it's not
so.

00:59:15.279 --> 00:59:16.279
You have lost that; you have lost that meticulousness.

00:59:16.279 --> 00:59:23.299
I know of a Sahaj Yogini; she was running
a shop, and she said, "Mother I knew each

00:59:23.299 --> 00:59:29.190
and everything, and I knew each and every
price, and everything I knew in this shop,

00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:32.380
but since I've got realization; I've forgotten
everything."

00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:35.130
So are you happy or unhappy?

00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:36.499
"I'm very happy."

00:59:36.499 --> 00:59:37.499
Why?

00:59:37.499 --> 00:59:41.400
"Because now I'm making a big profit."

00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:42.400
Profit is the main thing.

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:45.529
Why should you try to remember each and every
thing?

00:59:45.529 --> 00:59:53.619
So it is to be very meticulous, to be very
systematic, very, world is, if you see around

00:59:53.619 --> 00:59:57.700
- no tree is systematic.

00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:00.160
It is unsystematically systematic.

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:05.249
Some leaves are this side, some are that side;
some branches are on that side.

01:00:05.249 --> 01:00:12.099
There's no system, because then you become
a military, if you form a system.

01:00:12.099 --> 01:00:15.460
So in Sahaja Yoga there is no system.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.569
We are beyond time.

01:00:17.569 --> 01:00:23.309
We are beyond all kinds of systems; we have
no system.

01:00:23.309 --> 01:00:28.650
All of our system is, "What is the unigion
within ourselves?"

01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:35.710
Like these two hands, they have no system
built in nothing, but they move.

01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:41.819
Especially Italy if you want, both the hands
move like that all the time in Italy.

01:00:41.819 --> 01:00:46.289
And I don't know what it means, but they all
do the same thing.

01:00:46.289 --> 01:00:48.410
There's no system built in.

01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:52.140
Nobody said them that do these gestures and
all that.

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:58.420
But they do it, and do it naturally, all of
them together - without any system.

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:05.779
So to build up mental systems is wrong and
against Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:05.779 --> 01:01:09.339
Some people have written to Me, "Mother we
want to translate your transcriptions, do

01:01:09.339 --> 01:01:11.390
this, do that" and plans.

01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:15.200
I said forget it.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.200
Forget.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:22.190
Because if you start planning you see, you
will definitely, definitely fall into the

01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:25.079
trap of systems.

01:01:25.079 --> 01:01:30.369
You'll have to follow systems; this system
is good, that system is good.

01:01:30.369 --> 01:01:31.690
Why not have this way?

01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:36.920
And because I don't, I don't say that it's
wrong, because you have been used to systems.

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:37.970
Especially in the West people have over systematic,
over systematic, in everything.

01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:46.849
Like they'll have courses you see built up,
then the spoons, then the forks, then the

01:01:46.849 --> 01:02:01.720
how to move, and what to eat, and how to eat.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.839
I mean it is too much.

01:02:05.839 --> 01:02:06.840
If you have to eat food, it's straightforward;
you can eat it with your hands.

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:07.840
No system needed.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:14.950
For all these systems and norms are too much
in the West, and you should really try to

01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:15.979
them curb down.

01:02:15.979 --> 01:02:22.410
As a result they had anti-culture and all
that nonsense; another kind of stupidity where

01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:26.710
they were building up another kind of a system.

01:02:26.710 --> 01:02:30.640
See then they said, "We are hippies now."

01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:31.640
All right.

01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:37.059
So they must have hair never washed, never
clean with lice in their heads, and must be

01:02:37.059 --> 01:02:39.900
all like, you can say, the shankara style
you see.

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:47.299
So all of them have to have that.

01:02:47.299 --> 01:02:49.619
Again system.

01:02:49.619 --> 01:02:52.869
There's no variety; one hippie means another
the same.

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:55.450
You cannot make them out one from another.

01:02:55.450 --> 01:02:58.829
If somebody puts say a ring here - everybody
will put.

01:02:58.829 --> 01:03:05.619
If he puts a ring here - everybody will put;
without any brains, without any understanding.

01:03:05.619 --> 01:03:12.640
And they talk of individuality; of personality
-where is the individuality?

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:19.829
There's no individuality, because you take
to anything that your gang, you can call,

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:26.410
or you can call the crowds that take it, very
fashionable.

01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:35.140
In India if you say if it is very fashionable,
it means it is very expensive, and very beautiful

01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:42.140
and is, I mean is very elite, elite word.

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:46.420
But when I said, "This is very fashionable,"
means everybody likes it.

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:50.160
It could be punky thing or anything, it's
fashionable.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.160
Finished.

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.450
It's the fashion.

01:03:52.450 --> 01:04:00.569
Means you do not have your own idea, your
own personality, your own individuality.

01:04:00.569 --> 01:04:07.920
In Sahaja Yoga, you too are not bound to any
fashion, no fashion.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:11.539
If like; wear this, wear that, whatever you
like.

01:04:11.539 --> 01:04:19.829
If you fit do what you like, you can wear
whatever you like, but you, as I said again

01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:26.400
that you will govern yourself, you'll be your
own guru, you'll be your own master, and you'll

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:34.340
do whatever is good, whatever is decent, whatever
the Deities will like, will just do it that

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:39.349
way because now you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:42.900
So the life becomes so much easier, so much
easier.

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:48.829
You don't worry about things which are not
there, and you are not also worried about

01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:51.019
the things which are there.

01:04:51.019 --> 01:04:57.099
Because you think now, you see something,
all right I have got these knives now; I must

01:04:57.099 --> 01:05:00.880
keep this one for somebody.

01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.690
I must give it to someone.

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:05.640
So I got a ring which was quite big.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:10.109
Was thinking whom should I give this; who
has got thick fingers?

01:05:10.109 --> 01:05:15.680
So I started looking at the fingers of everyone
you see, whosoever has a thick finger I'll

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:17.880
give him this one.

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:21.219
I mean the thought was just the other way
around.

01:05:21.219 --> 01:05:24.380
Supposing you are not a Sahaja Yogi then you'll
say, "Oh Ma, such a big thick finger, why

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:27.849
not take out some gold and use it, sell it
off?"

01:05:27.849 --> 01:05:34.680
Or else you see, "You can take out the stone
from here."

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:39.420
I mean all kinds of nonsensical things you'll
think, but you'll not think that you better

01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:42.859
give it to somebody because you can't wear
it; it's too big for you.

01:05:42.859 --> 01:05:45.239
Why not give it to other?

01:05:45.239 --> 01:05:46.839
What's wrong?

01:05:46.839 --> 01:05:51.329
After all, it is not fitting you, so give
it to other.

01:05:51.329 --> 01:05:53.880
But this is only possible in Sahaja Yoga.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:06:05.280
I've seen people, very kind, very, very kind
people who have been very sweet to each other

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:11.299
and exactly what the other person wants, they'll
buy and give it to that person.

01:06:11.299 --> 01:06:16.599
Or may say, oh no I have one, I'll give it
to you.

01:06:16.599 --> 01:06:18.799
They do it like that.

01:06:18.799 --> 01:06:21.540
It's all the time thinking about others.

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:23.989
What should I give?

01:06:23.989 --> 01:06:26.769
What should I do?

01:06:26.769 --> 01:06:30.609
It's the expression of that joy, the compassion
within you.

01:06:30.609 --> 01:06:37.250
You use your matter for that, all the time,
all the time.

01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:41.390
Like somebody's house was burgled in Canada.

01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:46.900
So she writes to Me, "Thank God my house is
cleaned out now, I didn't know what to do

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:48.569
with it - the junk".

01:06:48.569 --> 01:06:53.420
So you see this kind of an attitude comes
in that if you have to do, give to someone,

01:06:53.420 --> 01:07:01.440
then give it to someone who is a Sahaja Yogi
to express your love.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:06.609
But normally people will do whatever is the
junk in the house, you see whatever is rotten,

01:07:06.609 --> 01:07:09.849
finished, that they will give as a present.

01:07:09.849 --> 01:07:14.759
But when you are a Sahaja Yogi you want to
give something really very special, because

01:07:14.759 --> 01:07:23.369
the whole being has become so beautiful - just
like a flower I should say which wants to

01:07:23.369 --> 01:07:31.260
give fragrance to others; all the time the
fragrance of your compassion and love, affection

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:33.489
and security.

01:07:33.489 --> 01:07:43.700
It's a new age, that what they say, but I
would say it's a new human beings that are

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:45.309
before Me.

01:07:45.309 --> 01:07:53.459
And all this newness has so many beautiful
facets that they really sparkle like diamonds,

01:07:53.459 --> 01:07:57.289
no doubt about it.

01:07:57.289 --> 01:08:10.240
My only blessings to you is that you grow
in it and grow in it and become greater and

01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:19.319
greater people; never thinking that you are
better than others; never thinking that you

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:20.319
are special than others.

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:22.740
This will definitely soothe you down completely.

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:25.570
Somebody might have hurt you somewhere, doesn't
matter.

01:08:25.570 --> 01:08:28.359
Somebody must have scolded you, doesn't matter.

01:08:28.359 --> 01:08:35.779
What is your capacity is to - love another
person, and to be affectionate and kind.

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:45.460
I'm really amazed how these 25 years have
passed with all kinds of stupid problems,

01:08:45.460 --> 01:08:50.190
and nice things and - such a mixture.

01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:56.710
And all those things have never disturbed
Me; I was never disturbed.

01:08:56.710 --> 01:09:02.549
I used to act sometimes that I am angry, or
sometimes I used to say things which I should

01:09:02.549 --> 01:09:08.389
not have normally said, because it was needed
to be said.

01:09:08.389 --> 01:09:18.650
But, on the whole, like sitting in a very
big ship you can say, we all are elevated

01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:24.659
into the realm of Divine Love.

01:09:24.659 --> 01:09:27.900
And this is what one has to enjoy.

01:09:27.900 --> 01:09:36.609
One person if he has that love and compassion,
and that pure love, then that person can emit

01:09:36.609 --> 01:09:46.150
it to others, and the record of this compassion
is extremely beautiful; which cannot be described

01:09:46.150 --> 01:09:47.150
in words.

01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:49.859
Like yesterday I couldn't speak.

01:09:49.859 --> 01:09:53.170
In what words I could put My feelings?

01:09:53.170 --> 01:10:03.860
I thought there are no words yet created on
this earth to express My deep feeling that

01:10:03.860 --> 01:10:07.090
how you people have taken Sahaja Yoga so well
and have understood it.

01:10:07.090 --> 01:10:08.090
May God bless you all.

01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:09.090
Sahasrara Puja is a short one.

01:10:09.090 --> 01:10:10.090
We don't have a very long puja for Sahasrara,
because you know Sahasrara breaks in no time.

01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:11.090
So it's not a very long puja, but it's very
deep, and again ultimately the last chakra

01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:12.090
which is opened out is here, is the heart.

01:10:12.090 --> 01:10:13.090
So in the Sahasrara Puja our hearts open out,
that's the main thing, and that is what one

01:10:13.090 --> 01:10:14.090
has to enjoy, opening of your heart.

01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:15.090
Don't worry about any Deities, about any rituals,
any this and that, but just open your heart.

01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:16.090
We are not bound by anything; just open your
heart.

01:10:16.090 --> 01:10:16.094
May God bless you.
