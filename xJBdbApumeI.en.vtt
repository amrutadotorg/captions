00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.160
Shri Raja Rajeshwari Puja

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.060
December 6th, 1991, Madras, India

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.190
Today we’ll be having Shri Ganesha Puja,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.090
followed by Raja Rajeshwari.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.020
So many names have been described of the Goddess:

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.200
specially Adi Shankaracharya called Her Raja

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.240
Rajeshwari, meaning She’s the Queen of all the Queens.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:20.050
Also for Mother Mary they have used this title in the West.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.180
These ideas have come from the pagan religion,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:38.010
as I have told you before, and that they didn’t come by

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.090
the description of Mother Mary in the Bible.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:54.060
That shows that there has been lot of changes into the

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.030
script of holy Bible.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.230
Also there has been lot of changes in the script of

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.000
Indian scriptures, even Gita.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.040
And that’s how the derailment in every religion started.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.060
And the intellectuals took advantage of it

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.070
and started projecting their own idea,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.050
saying things, describing things

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.130
which were absolutely against divine Power.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.220
You are all very fortunate people on this Earth

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.050
that you have discovered the reality,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.020
and you see that all these things

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.180
which were mythological are true;

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.050
all the things that are intellectual is not true;

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:14.060
also whatever are used for the purpose of dividing people

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.170
from each other are not true.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.090
Because we believe in all the religions,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.040
that’s why every religious person, so-called,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.020
is against us;

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.080
because you are supposed to believe only in one religion

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.000
and fight all the rest.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.080
If you believe in all religions, that means you are

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.200
absolutely not religious – this is the concept.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.110
And that shocked them, that we believe in all the religions

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.040
and we respect all the incarnations, and that we believe in

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.040
the integration of all these deities.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.080
Regarding Ganesha, it must have been a big revelation for

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.150
you people who are from the Western countries.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.030
Even in the north I don’t find Ganesha is so much

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.160
worshipped as worshipped in the south, specially in this

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.180
area, and also in Maharashtra; because in Maharashtra

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.050
we have eight swayambhu Ganeshas,

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.160
and they all believe in it.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.090
It is now said that it is all blind faith, and this and that.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.130
But now you have seen Ganesha standing behind Me,

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.140
within Me:

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.100
it’s just to prove that there is a deity called Ganesha.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.100
You’ll be given those photographs where Ganesha is

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.020
halfway sitting here, and the rest is My sari and all that.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.190
But all this is to convince you

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.150
that there is a deity which is Shri Ganesh,

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.080
and that He acts, works through Mooladhara.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.050
This knowledge was known to Indian people

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.080
thousands of years back.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.070
This kuchipudi dancing started seven centuries before Christ,

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.110
so you can imagine, the concept of Ganesha must

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.190
have been thousands of years back.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.140
So the people were very much evolved spiritually in this

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.020
country, and they knew what are the deities are, how they

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.130
look like, what are their functions are – though it was a

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.080
secret knowledge for the general public.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.190
But whatever the saints said was accepted,

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.040
because there was no ego about it.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.000
I have been trying to locate why

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.170
in the West people develop so much of ego.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.010
Still I have not been able to find out the basic reason,

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:17.190
why this kind of aggressiveness comes in through the ego part.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.230
One can say that competitiveness and all that, but this has

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:30.030
been the history in the West that even the people who

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:37.010
followed Christ, which was nothing but humility absolutely

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.090
absolutely writ large everywhere,

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.100
still those people were so aggressive.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.050
Now the humility is the main thing one has to understand.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.050
And you’ll be surprised, the humility is called as vinay,

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:56.130
which is the quality of Shri Ganesha – Vinayaka.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.120
“Vidya vinayen shobhate.” “Vidya” means “The knowledge

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.230
is only decorated with humility.”

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.090
So the humility you saw yesterday of these great artists,

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.100
and the great gurus who were there.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.060
And the guru invited Me to his academy,

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:24.140
and he made all kinds of offerings as they would do

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.140
to a Goddess.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.060
I was so much touched, the ready acceptance

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.120
of Me and of Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.000
Even this Kalakshetra, which was dominated by

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.200
Theosophical Society – though this lady

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.060
didn’t bother so much about Theosophical Society –

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.120
and she had created this big auditorium and all that,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.230
and everything she dedicated to art.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.140
She didn’t allow Theosophical Society enter into it.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:04.100
Despite all that, how they accepted Me, all of them,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:12.100
you can see so clearly their devotion and understanding.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.070
To be humble with a saint is absolutely

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:21.180
an unwritten law of this country.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:27.190
And a saint is not to be challenged, not to be dominated.

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.030
Whatever the saint says must be accepted.

00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:37.190
So the first quality that Ganesha should give us is vinay –

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:41.060
“vinay” meaning the humility.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.160
The humility is not superficial, like you go on saying

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.210
“sorry” or “excuse me”, “I’m afraid” -

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.100
not that way. It’s not watchik,

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.220
it’s not just lip-service, but from within

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.120
the humility has to come.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.100
Now the humility is, of course, is always marred by ego

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.140
and the ego just keeps you afloat, and you never

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.170
understand that you have been egoistical.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.000
Even when I talk about ego, people think that

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.120
Mother is saying about somebody else there,

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.180
they never think “it’s me who has this ego.”

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.100
So Ganesha is the killer of ego,

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:31.070
because humility is the only thing that really

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:34.040
can neutralize your ego.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:38.230
To humble down yourself, you have to see what?

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.240
For example in this country you have come, very simple

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.130
people, you see, living very simply, they don’t have all

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:52.060
these sophisticated things around them; eating

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:56.080
with their hands, eating on the plant and leaves, you see.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:59.110
And according to certain ladies who have lived here,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.180
the Westerners, they think they are all primitive.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:13.120
But see the way they have developed this art.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:19.050
This kind of swiftness and this kind of, even jumping

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:24.130
this kind, you cannot achieve.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:30.020
Now, what is the reason for this kind of working,

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:34.010
is humility towards art.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.080
Art is to be respected.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:39.100
A guru is to be respected.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:45.050
Respect is the only way to learning anything.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:49.120
That is sort of ingrained in an Indian blood, I think,

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:57.110
that you must obey your guru implicitly, implicitly.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.220
And this guru is training so many people,

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:02.140
there are so many girls there,

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:11.110
not for anything but just to express his art.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.040
He doesn’t get much money, I could see that.

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:16.230
They have very little provision,

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.030
and also he doesn’t charge too much.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.120
But the dedication he has is like

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:30.160
the dedication of Shri Ganesha to His Mother.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:37.080
And the way he is completely drawn into it:

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.100
all other things are not important.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.150
So for humility you have to withdraw your attention

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:48.200
from other things.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.040
This is an extremely important thing.

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:59.110
If your attention is going to your other problems,

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:03.100
this, that, or if you are trying to come to Sahaja Yoga

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:10.160
through other channels, it’s not going to work out.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.160
You have to humble down in your heart,

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.100
absolutely humble down.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.060
He's innocent, that’s why He’s humble.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:29.010
If you are not innocent, then you cannot be humble.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:36.140
Sign of innocence is humility.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:42.150
A good child, a nice innocent child is extremely obedient.

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:47.070
Whatever you tell them, they just obey.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:52.000
I know My grandchildren – once we were going to Nepal,

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.140
and it was very cold there.

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.020
And their mother said,

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.030
“They won’t take anything on their heads.”

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.170
I said, “I’ll do it in one, one minute.”

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.240
I just called them, gave them pieces of ordinary cloth.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.230
I said, “You have to cover your head”. “All right.”

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.090
They put it on their head,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.240
put it properly, fixed it up.

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:14.110
They were looking a little weird, but they didn’t mind.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:18.230
This is what

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.200
is missing,

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:28.210
and that’s why we find the depth is less.

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.070
Not just only the conditionings –

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.130
I would not say the conditioning.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:40.090
People are out of conditioning;

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.240
even Indians have become like that.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:51.180
It’s difficult for them to be humble, very difficult.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.060
You may call Western influence, or maybe that they have

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:57.010
forgotten their past.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.180
But humility is so important.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.210
Like I must tell you, from our childhood, though I was born

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.140
in a Christian family, we had to touch the Mother Earth

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.100
and ask for forgiveness first,

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.130
so you put it to your head.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.070
And touch the feet of your parents,

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:18.210
and all the elders of the family – isn’t it so?

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.070
Touch everybody’s feet who are elder in the family.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.070
Even some old servants, you see, who had looked after our

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:31.110
elder brothers and all that – touch their feet also.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.180
But that humility is lacking.

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:41.100
And that dignity that elders should have is also not there.

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:46.190
But whatever it is, it was our duty to touch everybody’s feet,

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:51.060
and not to discuss the elders.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:57.010
So this will create such a beautiful atmosphere in Sahaja Yoga

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:03.060
if you insist that “Am I humble in doing this?”

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.000
Just ask a question,

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:10.040
“Have I been humble in doing this, or in saying this?”

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:16.130
Now the problems are criticizing the leaders.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:22.210
They are leaders because they deserve it.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.200
The day I find they are no good, I’ll throw them out –

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.110
also you know that very well.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:31.000
But there is no humility.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.060
Then the humility is replaced by ego, and that ego creates

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.120
an ego in the leaders.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:44.220
The leaders become egoistical, and so many leaders

00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.020
are thrown out.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.030
I mean I just don’t know, when the balance has to come,

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:55.100
whether I should blame the members or the leaders.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.140
So Mother has appointed them as leaders,

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:00.230
so let us be humble.

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:04.130
After all, there must be some reason why Mother has asked

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.020
them to be the leaders.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.000
Why should we try to quarrel with them, find faults?

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:15.150
Like a union we form.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:22.230
So Shri Ganesha, who is so humble, and His ganas

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.110
are even more humble in a way,

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:28.120
because He won’t tolerate any gana

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.110
who is not humble to Mother.

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:38.100
With a little movement of the eyes they are there to fight,

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:41.210
and to do whatever it is they are suggested.

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:46.000
And they understand every angle of the eye of their Mother,

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.160
what is to be done.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:50.240
So this kind of dedication only

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:54.190
can make you deeper and deeper.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:17:00.240
Now may be that the way we know about that in the West,

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:05.120
we have to spread out more, we have to advertise more,

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:08.010
we have to talk about ourselves more,

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.230
we have to boast about ourselves more.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.230
The more you do it, the more successful you’ll be.

00:17:15.090 --> 00:17:17.060
That’s what you see it every day.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.040
They boast “I believe” – you see,

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:22.040
who are you to believe or not to believe?

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.050
Who are you to say this?

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:27.020
But sort of, see your image has to go like that –

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:36.090
a man of great personality, or some sort of a big profile.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:42.090
You create a profile; absolutely artificial, nonsensical.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.030
And very surprising, to such a profile which is so

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:51.090
artificial, people bow.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:56.190
Maybe they are also artificial, that’s why they bow to

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.240
these artificial people.

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.100
I’m surprised. I mean, these are well-known crooks,

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.200
so people know they are crooks, they have done all kinds,

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:09.170
but still they will prostrate before them.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.000
Because maybe that they want some sort of a material

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.130
advantage out of it, or I don’t know,

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:20.050
some sort of an artificial advantage.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.180
Even a taking a photograph with such a man is regarded

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:26.180
as something very great.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:37.190
So all these ideas must be seen through by Sahaja yogis.

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.080
They have to see through this joke, this drama, what’s

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:46.020
going on, and also reflect it back and introspect and see,

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:50.020
“I hope I don’t have this in me.”

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:55.220
Sometimes we laugh at others but we ourselves are in it.

00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:00.130
So once we start introspecting, we see within ourselves,

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:05.220
“Yes, this is there.”

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:10.070
There are certain Sahaja yogis in certain countries,

00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.230
I’m always being reported as, suddenly they say,

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:17.230
“Mother has given me special powers.” Or they say,

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.120
“I am Maha Mataji” – also there was one like that,

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:25.060
Maha Mataji.

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.130
I’ve never said I am Mataji even.

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:33.060
You people call Me that, I’ve never said that.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.190
But he said, “I am Maha Mataji.”

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.130
You can call him mad, you can call him anything,

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:44.030
but it is definitely his arrogance

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:49.010
has prospered in such a way that

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:52.120
he doesn’t see what he’s talking about.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:02.150
This is how also you pamper the ego of your leaders,

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.130
by attacking him.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.170
The more you attack him, he reacts and when he reacts,

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:12.160
his ego goes on pumping like that.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:22.200
As I told you, today we are going to do

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.050
the worship of Raja Rajeshwari.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.070
I have never said this to you before.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.100
I’ve never asked you to read Guru Gita,

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.070
for the same reason.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.220
I’ve never told you that She is Raja Rajeshwari,

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:41.000
because again that might little bit go into your ego,

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:44.000
“How can She be the Queen of all the Queens?”

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.190
Of course, Christ’s Mother is all right,

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.050
but not Mataji – it’s too much!

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.160
So I never told you this.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:56.040
I said, “Baba, I’m a humble Mother, that’s all,

00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:59.240
Holy Mother” – finished.

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:04.190
Creates holes here, that’s why it may, may be!

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:12.010
Whatever it is, I could understand what was the problem,

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:15.140
and in a very humorous way we have managed many things.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:21.100
But still I feel that, see the way these artists are,

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:25.230
the way these people are, the way they are creating things –

00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:30.190
may not be according to your ideas about decorativeness,

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:32.010
or all that.

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:35.030
You might say it’s rather loud, or maybe this, that,

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:39.080
as it is, you see, always in the brain.

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.160
“It could have been much less, there should be some

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
spaced-out thing,” and all that.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:49.060
You might start criticizing, because that‘s one of

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:52.210
the qualities of people who are not humble,

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:56.140
that they think they have a capacity to criticize anything.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:59.190
“Oh, I don’t like this color, it’s no good.”

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:07.060
But the artist has made it with his heart – appreciate it!

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.230
So the second point is to appreciate.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:18.060
Appreciate your life; whatever it is, appreciate,

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.050
accept it.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:23.240
But not with reluctance.

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:28.110
All these mental ideas in the head that art means this

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:32.220
and art means that, has led us to this situation that

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.070
we are not going to have any more Rembrandts nor

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.140
Michelangelo – finished.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.180
It’s not mental, art is never mental.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:45.150
It’s coming from inside, and whatever is coming from

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:53.110
inside cannot be compared with outside our ideas.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:58.080
So the appreciation part – I mean, you can say South

00:22:58.170 --> 00:23:03.150
Indians wear very, very loud dresses in our own style.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:07.240
But to Me they do not.

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.220
Some might say something else.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:16.190
Also I’ve noticed the North Indians must criticize

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.200
the South Indians, the South Indians must criticize

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.040
the North Indians.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.070
But whatever it is, what is – nobody’s getting

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:31.020
good out of anyone. It’s stupidity, it is stupidity.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:34.050
But to appreciate

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:41.170
and to accept, you imbibe that.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:47.150
North Indians cannot like South Indian food, whatever it is.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.210
Whatever you may try, they cannot.

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:51.190
They cannot like their music also.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.050
Now, can you imagine the whole of India divided

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.210
into two parts,

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.020
and the South Indians cannot like North Indian food nor

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.110
the North Indian dancing –

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:05.040
I mean, even in our country.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:10.220
We’re so divisible, is this country is, that a person

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:15.000
from Rameshwaram won’t like food from Madras,

00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.040
a person from Madras won’t like the food from Delhi.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:26.000
So these divisive methods have come through

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:30.200
the innate humility not being you.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.160
If you can enjoy each and everything,

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:37.220
then you are humble.

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:44.200
If you can appreciate each and every expression,

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:50.180
then you are humble.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.130
This humility is a very deep-down character,

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:01.210
because from Mooladhara it comes.

00:25:05.010 --> 00:25:08.040
And that is what is Shri Ganesha.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:12.160
Just imagine, He has a little rat on which He moves about,

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:19.100
He doesn’t have Impala cars or Rolls Royces.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.210
He just moves, with all His big stomach

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:26.210
He moves on a little rat.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:35.140
No assertion of His powers – He’s so humble,

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:39.090
He’s so sweet.

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:42.170
And He’s the creator of all the rhythms and

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.240
things and vibrations.

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:50.230
Without Him, I don’t know what would be this world.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:57.200
And that’s what we have to really appreciate everywhere,

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.010
instead of denouncing this, that.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:04.100
I mean, like even the color of this room you may not like,

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.150
this you may not like.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.090
I mean, there are so many things you don’t like.

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:11.210
Then I have to ask, “What do you like?”

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:15.180
“Baked beans” – all right!

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.080
We have to open out ourselves.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:31.100
With humility you open out, you penetrate, you spread.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:35.060
Without humility you cannot, because you are objecting

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:39.110
to everything, creating a wall.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:45.040
Only the humility will make you spread out.

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:49.090
Today, the first day of our tour,

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:58.050
I would request you that you have to be very, very humble.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:04.070
Understand that humility is extremely simple,

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:07.040
and is beautiful.

00:27:07.150 --> 00:27:10.180
You saw that little girl playing veena, such a difficult

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:16.000
Adi Vadyam, primordial instrument, playing with such

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.150
sweetness, with such deftness, and so humble.

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:21.120
And she came to Me and she said,

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.190
“Mother, what a privilege it was that I got

00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:28.230
the opportunity to play before You.”

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:33.230
Just imagine – such a genius.

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:37.180
Another one who met Me last time was a mandolin player

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.000
about the same age, maybe younger.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.190
I mean, he is now world-renowned, but when he played

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.170
before Me, wouldn’t accept any money, nothing,

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.180
he just went into ecstasy.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:53.130
Even the dancer, she told Me she went into ecstasy

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:54.210
when she saw Me,

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:57.170
and she just danced so well with such vigor.

00:27:58.010 --> 00:28:00.080
And she – she had temperature.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:01.230
She said, “My temperature is gone, everything,

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:05.130
I am perfectly all right.”

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:09.110
Look at those artists. I mean, they have never known Me,

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.190
they don’t know anything about Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:16.010
But what a humble understanding of Divinity –

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:20.120
because they are humble.

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.200
Divinity never asserts itself, doesn’t propagate itself,

00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:27.020
doesn’t make a big sound.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.010
So now they are here. Come along.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.220
Is that Guido?

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.220
Italians have come.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:42.180
That’s why I delayed the puja today.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.090
Is that Guido? Just call him.

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:59.110
Guido is too humble to come forward.

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:15.160
Come in, come in.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:27.050
Just move forward a little bit.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:40.030
May God bless you.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:44.230
I’ve been waiting for you!

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:55.080
Please, please be seated.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.120
No, no, come! Come along.

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:13.180
Can you – you can all sit in front, there is space.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:17.030
Just come …. you can all sit there.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.140
I have to keep them pleased, you see,

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:23.130
because I am living in Italy!

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.080
Just come on ….

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:35.160
It’s all right, so they might get a part of it.

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.140
Just come in front, there.

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.160
Or you can sit in the middle, doesn’t matter.

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:46.000
You can sit there wherever you are, yes, you can.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:57.240
Come forward, come forward, there’s space here.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.180
So I was telling them about Shri Ganesha,

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:17.160
that His essential power comes through His humility;

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:22.020
and that we all have to be extremely humble,

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:26.130
extremely humble, appreciating everything.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:30.020
Of course, you must make them hear My lecture –

00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:32.120
they have already taped it – so they will know

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:35.010
what I am saying today.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:37.020
But now we can have the puja.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:42.190
May God bless you.
