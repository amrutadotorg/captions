WEBVTT

00:20.080 --> 00:26.160
Shri Raja Rajeshwari Puja

00:28.160 --> 00:35.060
December 6th, 1991, Madras, India

00:38.180 --> 00:41.190
Today we’ll be having Shri Ganesha Puja,

00:42.130 --> 00:47.090
followed by Raja Rajeshwari.

00:49.030 --> 00:56.020
So many names have been described of the Goddess:

00:57.180 --> 00:59.200
specially Adi Shankaracharya called Her Raja

01:00.010 --> 01:04.240
Rajeshwari, meaning She’s the Queen of all the Queens.

01:05.160 --> 01:20.050
Also for Mother Mary they have used this title in the West.

01:24.120 --> 01:29.180
These ideas have come from the pagan religion,

01:30.050 --> 01:38.010
as I have told you before, and that they didn’t come by

01:40.000 --> 01:45.090
the description of Mother Mary in the Bible.

01:45.220 --> 01:54.060
That shows that there has been lot of changes into the

01:54.220 --> 01:59.030
script of holy Bible.

01:59.200 --> 02:05.230
Also there has been lot of changes in the script of

02:06.110 --> 02:09.000
Indian scriptures, even Gita.

02:13.040 --> 02:20.040
And that’s how the derailment in every religion started.

02:21.090 --> 02:25.060
And the intellectuals took advantage of it

02:26.130 --> 02:30.070
and started projecting their own idea,

02:33.000 --> 02:37.050
saying things, describing things

02:37.230 --> 02:42.130
which were absolutely against divine Power.

02:43.200 --> 02:48.220
You are all very fortunate people on this Earth

02:49.120 --> 02:52.050
that you have discovered the reality,

02:52.070 --> 02:56.020
and you see that all these things

02:56.110 --> 02:59.180
which were mythological are true;

03:00.060 --> 03:04.050
all the things that are intellectual is not true;

03:04.170 --> 03:14.060
also whatever are used for the purpose of dividing people

03:14.180 --> 03:18.170
from each other are not true.

03:18.240 --> 03:22.090
Because we believe in all the religions,

03:22.220 --> 03:27.040
that’s why every religious person, so-called,

03:27.160 --> 03:29.020
is against us;

03:29.170 --> 03:31.080
because you are supposed to believe only in one religion

03:31.170 --> 03:34.000
and fight all the rest.

03:34.140 --> 03:36.080
If you believe in all religions, that means you are

03:37.000 --> 03:41.200
absolutely not religious – this is the concept.

03:42.060 --> 03:44.110
And that shocked them, that we believe in all the religions

03:44.230 --> 03:49.040
and we respect all the incarnations, and that we believe in

03:49.100 --> 03:55.040
the integration of all these deities.

03:56.110 --> 04:01.080
Regarding Ganesha, it must have been a big revelation for

04:01.190 --> 04:04.150
you people who are from the Western countries.

04:04.220 --> 04:07.030
Even in the north I don’t find Ganesha is so much

04:07.110 --> 04:11.160
worshipped as worshipped in the south, specially in this

04:12.020 --> 04:16.180
area, and also in Maharashtra; because in Maharashtra

04:17.040 --> 04:20.050
we have eight swayambhu Ganeshas,

04:20.150 --> 04:22.160
and they all believe in it.

04:23.200 --> 04:27.090
It is now said that it is all blind faith, and this and that.

04:28.070 --> 04:32.130
But now you have seen Ganesha standing behind Me,

04:32.230 --> 04:34.140
within Me:

04:35.000 --> 04:40.100
it’s just to prove that there is a deity called Ganesha.

04:41.150 --> 04:44.100
You’ll be given those photographs where Ganesha is

04:44.180 --> 04:50.020
halfway sitting here, and the rest is My sari and all that.

04:54.100 --> 04:58.190
But all this is to convince you

04:59.160 --> 05:05.150
that there is a deity which is Shri Ganesh,

05:05.190 --> 05:10.080
and that He acts, works through Mooladhara.

05:10.230 --> 05:15.050
This knowledge was known to Indian people

05:15.160 --> 05:18.080
thousands of years back.

05:18.080 --> 05:24.070
This kuchipudi dancing started seven centuries before Christ,

05:24.190 --> 05:28.110
so you can imagine, the concept of Ganesha must

05:29.000 --> 05:32.190
have been thousands of years back.

05:33.240 --> 05:37.140
So the people were very much evolved spiritually in this

05:37.220 --> 05:42.020
country, and they knew what are the deities are, how they

05:42.110 --> 05:47.130
look like, what are their functions are – though it was a

05:47.200 --> 05:50.080
secret knowledge for the general public.

05:50.090 --> 05:53.190
But whatever the saints said was accepted,

05:54.070 --> 05:58.040
because there was no ego about it.

05:59.220 --> 06:02.000
I have been trying to locate why

06:02.120 --> 06:05.170
in the West people develop so much of ego.

06:06.030 --> 06:10.010
Still I have not been able to find out the basic reason,

06:10.130 --> 06:17.190
why this kind of aggressiveness comes in through the ego part.

06:18.100 --> 06:22.230
One can say that competitiveness and all that, but this has

06:23.080 --> 06:30.030
been the history in the West that even the people who

06:30.110 --> 06:37.010
followed Christ, which was nothing but humility absolutely

06:37.120 --> 06:39.090
absolutely writ large everywhere,

06:39.240 --> 06:43.100
still those people were so aggressive.

06:43.210 --> 06:48.050
Now the humility is the main thing one has to understand.

06:48.200 --> 06:52.050
And you’ll be surprised, the humility is called as vinay,

06:52.140 --> 06:56.130
which is the quality of Shri Ganesha – Vinayaka.

06:56.220 --> 07:01.120
“Vidya vinayen shobhate.” “Vidya” means “The knowledge

07:01.200 --> 07:05.230
is only decorated with humility.”

07:06.140 --> 07:10.090
So the humility you saw yesterday of these great artists,

07:10.210 --> 07:13.100
and the great gurus who were there.

07:13.130 --> 07:16.060
And the guru invited Me to his academy,

07:16.220 --> 07:24.140
and he made all kinds of offerings as they would do

07:24.230 --> 07:26.140
to a Goddess.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.060
I was so much touched, the ready acceptance

07:33.120 --> 07:37.120
of Me and of Sahaja Yoga.

07:37.120 --> 07:40.000
Even this Kalakshetra, which was dominated by

07:40.120 --> 07:42.200
Theosophical Society – though this lady

07:43.040 --> 07:46.060
didn’t bother so much about Theosophical Society –

07:46.160 --> 07:51.120
and she had created this big auditorium and all that,

07:51.240 --> 07:53.230
and everything she dedicated to art.

07:54.070 --> 07:58.140
She didn’t allow Theosophical Society enter into it.

08:00.090 --> 08:04.100
Despite all that, how they accepted Me, all of them,

08:04.160 --> 08:12.100
you can see so clearly their devotion and understanding.

08:13.120 --> 08:18.070
To be humble with a saint is absolutely

08:18.170 --> 08:21.180
an unwritten law of this country.

08:22.110 --> 08:27.190
And a saint is not to be challenged, not to be dominated.

08:28.060 --> 08:32.030
Whatever the saint says must be accepted.

08:32.150 --> 08:37.190
So the first quality that Ganesha should give us is vinay –

08:38.020 --> 08:41.060
“vinay” meaning the humility.

08:43.080 --> 08:47.160
The humility is not superficial, like you go on saying

08:48.010 --> 08:51.210
“sorry” or “excuse me”, “I’m afraid” -

08:52.030 --> 08:54.100
not that way. It’s not watchik,

08:54.230 --> 08:58.220
it’s not just lip-service, but from within

08:59.050 --> 09:02.120
the humility has to come.

09:03.040 --> 09:07.100
Now the humility is, of course, is always marred by ego

09:07.230 --> 09:11.140
and the ego just keeps you afloat, and you never

09:11.220 --> 09:15.170
understand that you have been egoistical.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.000
Even when I talk about ego, people think that

09:18.080 --> 09:20.120
Mother is saying about somebody else there,

09:20.200 --> 09:23.180
they never think “it’s me who has this ego.”

09:24.120 --> 09:27.100
So Ganesha is the killer of ego,

09:27.210 --> 09:31.070
because humility is the only thing that really

09:31.170 --> 09:34.040
can neutralize your ego.

09:34.170 --> 09:38.230
To humble down yourself, you have to see what?

09:39.140 --> 09:41.240
For example in this country you have come, very simple

09:42.100 --> 09:46.130
people, you see, living very simply, they don’t have all

09:46.150 --> 09:52.060
these sophisticated things around them; eating

09:52.150 --> 09:56.080
with their hands, eating on the plant and leaves, you see.

09:56.210 --> 09:59.110
And according to certain ladies who have lived here,

10:00.000 --> 10:05.180
the Westerners, they think they are all primitive.

10:06.240 --> 10:13.120
But see the way they have developed this art.

10:15.120 --> 10:19.050
This kind of swiftness and this kind of, even jumping

10:19.240 --> 10:24.130
this kind, you cannot achieve.

10:25.110 --> 10:30.020
Now, what is the reason for this kind of working,

10:30.050 --> 10:34.010
is humility towards art.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.080
Art is to be respected.

10:37.190 --> 10:39.100
A guru is to be respected.

10:39.220 --> 10:45.050
Respect is the only way to learning anything.

10:45.180 --> 10:49.120
That is sort of ingrained in an Indian blood, I think,

10:49.220 --> 10:57.110
that you must obey your guru implicitly, implicitly.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.220
And this guru is training so many people,

10:59.230 --> 11:02.140
there are so many girls there,

11:05.220 --> 11:11.110
not for anything but just to express his art.

11:11.240 --> 11:14.040
He doesn’t get much money, I could see that.

11:14.050 --> 11:16.230
They have very little provision,

11:18.030 --> 11:21.030
and also he doesn’t charge too much.

11:22.040 --> 11:26.120
But the dedication he has is like

11:26.220 --> 11:30.160
the dedication of Shri Ganesha to His Mother.

11:31.120 --> 11:37.080
And the way he is completely drawn into it:

11:37.160 --> 11:41.100
all other things are not important.

11:43.020 --> 11:46.150
So for humility you have to withdraw your attention

11:46.230 --> 11:48.200
from other things.

11:49.080 --> 11:53.040
This is an extremely important thing.

11:54.140 --> 11:59.110
If your attention is going to your other problems,

11:59.230 --> 12:03.100
this, that, or if you are trying to come to Sahaja Yoga

12:03.200 --> 12:10.160
through other channels, it’s not going to work out.

12:10.160 --> 12:15.160
You have to humble down in your heart,

12:16.030 --> 12:18.100
absolutely humble down.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.060
He's innocent, that’s why He’s humble.

12:24.170 --> 12:29.010
If you are not innocent, then you cannot be humble.

12:29.230 --> 12:36.140
Sign of innocence is humility.

12:37.020 --> 12:42.150
A good child, a nice innocent child is extremely obedient.

12:43.110 --> 12:47.070
Whatever you tell them, they just obey.

12:47.190 --> 12:52.000
I know My grandchildren – once we were going to Nepal,

12:52.080 --> 12:54.140
and it was very cold there.

12:54.230 --> 12:56.020
And their mother said,

12:56.110 --> 12:58.030
“They won’t take anything on their heads.”

12:58.090 --> 13:00.170
I said, “I’ll do it in one, one minute.”

13:00.240 --> 13:03.240
I just called them, gave them pieces of ordinary cloth.

13:03.260 --> 13:06.230
I said, “You have to cover your head”. “All right.”

13:07.040 --> 13:08.090
They put it on their head,

13:08.160 --> 13:09.240
put it properly, fixed it up.

13:10.050 --> 13:14.110
They were looking a little weird, but they didn’t mind.

13:16.130 --> 13:18.230
This is what

13:20.220 --> 13:23.200
is missing,

13:24.070 --> 13:28.210
and that’s why we find the depth is less.

13:33.090 --> 13:35.070
Not just only the conditionings –

13:35.170 --> 13:37.130
I would not say the conditioning.

13:37.210 --> 13:40.090
People are out of conditioning;

13:40.180 --> 13:43.240
even Indians have become like that.

13:44.240 --> 13:51.180
It’s difficult for them to be humble, very difficult.

13:52.020 --> 13:54.060
You may call Western influence, or maybe that they have

13:54.120 --> 13:57.010
forgotten their past.

13:57.130 --> 13:59.180
But humility is so important.

14:00.050 --> 14:02.210
Like I must tell you, from our childhood, though I was born

14:03.020 --> 14:06.140
in a Christian family, we had to touch the Mother Earth

14:06.220 --> 14:09.100
and ask for forgiveness first,

14:09.150 --> 14:12.130
so you put it to your head.

14:12.210 --> 14:15.070
And touch the feet of your parents,

14:15.130 --> 14:18.210
and all the elders of the family – isn’t it so?

14:19.040 --> 14:23.070
Touch everybody’s feet who are elder in the family.

14:23.140 --> 14:26.070
Even some old servants, you see, who had looked after our

14:26.140 --> 14:31.110
elder brothers and all that – touch their feet also.

14:32.010 --> 14:35.180
But that humility is lacking.

14:36.070 --> 14:41.100
And that dignity that elders should have is also not there.

14:41.180 --> 14:46.190
But whatever it is, it was our duty to touch everybody’s feet,

14:47.070 --> 14:51.060
and not to discuss the elders.

14:53.080 --> 14:57.010
So this will create such a beautiful atmosphere in Sahaja Yoga

14:57.090 --> 15:03.060
if you insist that “Am I humble in doing this?”

15:03.170 --> 15:05.000
Just ask a question,

15:05.090 --> 15:10.040
“Have I been humble in doing this, or in saying this?”

15:10.140 --> 15:16.130
Now the problems are criticizing the leaders.

15:18.150 --> 15:22.210
They are leaders because they deserve it.

15:23.110 --> 15:25.200
The day I find they are no good, I’ll throw them out –

15:26.030 --> 15:28.110
also you know that very well.

15:28.230 --> 15:31.000
But there is no humility.

15:32.000 --> 15:38.060
Then the humility is replaced by ego, and that ego creates

15:38.160 --> 15:41.120
an ego in the leaders.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.220
The leaders become egoistical, and so many leaders

15:44.220 --> 15:46.020
are thrown out.

15:46.120 --> 15:49.030
I mean I just don’t know, when the balance has to come,

15:49.140 --> 15:55.100
whether I should blame the members or the leaders.

15:55.210 --> 15:58.140
So Mother has appointed them as leaders,

15:58.230 --> 16:00.230
so let us be humble.

16:01.090 --> 16:04.130
After all, there must be some reason why Mother has asked

16:04.230 --> 16:07.020
them to be the leaders.

16:07.120 --> 16:10.000
Why should we try to quarrel with them, find faults?

16:10.070 --> 16:15.150
Like a union we form.

16:18.130 --> 16:22.230
So Shri Ganesha, who is so humble, and His ganas

16:23.100 --> 16:26.110
are even more humble in a way,

16:26.110 --> 16:28.120
because He won’t tolerate any gana

16:29.100 --> 16:32.110
who is not humble to Mother.

16:32.210 --> 16:38.100
With a little movement of the eyes they are there to fight,

16:38.180 --> 16:41.210
and to do whatever it is they are suggested.

16:42.030 --> 16:46.000
And they understand every angle of the eye of their Mother,

16:46.080 --> 16:48.160
what is to be done.

16:48.180 --> 16:50.240
So this kind of dedication only

16:51.110 --> 16:54.190
can make you deeper and deeper.

16:55.100 --> 17:00.240
Now may be that the way we know about that in the West,

17:01.090 --> 17:05.120
we have to spread out more, we have to advertise more,

17:05.220 --> 17:08.010
we have to talk about ourselves more,

17:08.080 --> 17:10.230
we have to boast about ourselves more.

17:11.060 --> 17:14.230
The more you do it, the more successful you’ll be.

17:15.090 --> 17:17.060
That’s what you see it every day.

17:17.080 --> 17:19.040
They boast “I believe” – you see,

17:19.110 --> 17:22.040
who are you to believe or not to believe?

17:22.100 --> 17:24.050
Who are you to say this?

17:24.140 --> 17:27.020
But sort of, see your image has to go like that –

17:27.050 --> 17:36.090
a man of great personality, or some sort of a big profile.

17:36.220 --> 17:42.090
You create a profile; absolutely artificial, nonsensical.

17:43.020 --> 17:46.030
And very surprising, to such a profile which is so

17:46.100 --> 17:51.090
artificial, people bow.

17:51.210 --> 17:56.190
Maybe they are also artificial, that’s why they bow to

17:57.020 --> 17:58.240
these artificial people.

17:59.080 --> 18:02.100
I’m surprised. I mean, these are well-known crooks,

18:02.160 --> 18:05.200
so people know they are crooks, they have done all kinds,

18:06.020 --> 18:09.170
but still they will prostrate before them.

18:09.240 --> 18:13.000
Because maybe that they want some sort of a material

18:13.060 --> 18:16.130
advantage out of it, or I don’t know,

18:16.190 --> 18:20.050
some sort of an artificial advantage.

18:20.110 --> 18:22.180
Even a taking a photograph with such a man is regarded

18:22.230 --> 18:26.180
as something very great.

18:28.120 --> 18:37.190
So all these ideas must be seen through by Sahaja yogis.

18:38.110 --> 18:41.080
They have to see through this joke, this drama, what’s

18:41.140 --> 18:46.020
going on, and also reflect it back and introspect and see,

18:46.080 --> 18:50.020
“I hope I don’t have this in me.”

18:50.110 --> 18:55.220
Sometimes we laugh at others but we ourselves are in it.

18:56.060 --> 19:00.130
So once we start introspecting, we see within ourselves,

19:01.030 --> 19:05.220
“Yes, this is there.”

19:06.060 --> 19:10.070
There are certain Sahaja yogis in certain countries,

19:10.140 --> 19:13.230
I’m always being reported as, suddenly they say,

19:14.030 --> 19:17.230
“Mother has given me special powers.” Or they say,

19:18.040 --> 19:20.120
“I am Maha Mataji” – also there was one like that,

19:20.120 --> 19:25.060
Maha Mataji.

19:27.040 --> 19:30.130
I’ve never said I am Mataji even.

19:30.220 --> 19:33.060
You people call Me that, I’ve never said that.

19:33.160 --> 19:36.190
But he said, “I am Maha Mataji.”

19:37.010 --> 19:39.130
You can call him mad, you can call him anything,

19:39.200 --> 19:44.030
but it is definitely his arrogance

19:45.030 --> 19:49.010
has prospered in such a way that

19:49.090 --> 19:52.120
he doesn’t see what he’s talking about.

19:56.200 --> 20:02.150
This is how also you pamper the ego of your leaders,

20:02.240 --> 20:05.130
by attacking him.

20:05.220 --> 20:08.170
The more you attack him, he reacts and when he reacts,

20:09.010 --> 20:12.160
his ego goes on pumping like that.

20:17.120 --> 20:22.200
As I told you, today we are going to do

20:23.060 --> 20:25.050
the worship of Raja Rajeshwari.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.070
I have never said this to you before.

20:28.190 --> 20:30.100
I’ve never asked you to read Guru Gita,

20:30.230 --> 20:32.070
for the same reason.

20:32.160 --> 20:35.220
I’ve never told you that She is Raja Rajeshwari,

20:36.170 --> 20:41.000
because again that might little bit go into your ego,

20:41.090 --> 20:44.000
“How can She be the Queen of all the Queens?”

20:44.010 --> 20:45.190
Of course, Christ’s Mother is all right,

20:46.040 --> 20:49.050
but not Mataji – it’s too much!

20:51.030 --> 20:53.160
So I never told you this.

20:54.030 --> 20:56.040
I said, “Baba, I’m a humble Mother, that’s all,

20:56.210 --> 20:59.240
Holy Mother” – finished.

21:00.090 --> 21:04.190
Creates holes here, that’s why it may, may be!

21:05.030 --> 21:12.010
Whatever it is, I could understand what was the problem,

21:12.120 --> 21:15.140
and in a very humorous way we have managed many things.

21:15.230 --> 21:21.100
But still I feel that, see the way these artists are,

21:21.160 --> 21:25.230
the way these people are, the way they are creating things –

21:26.110 --> 21:30.190
may not be according to your ideas about decorativeness,

21:31.020 --> 21:32.010
or all that.

21:32.110 --> 21:35.030
You might say it’s rather loud, or maybe this, that,

21:35.100 --> 21:39.080
as it is, you see, always in the brain.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.160
“It could have been much less, there should be some

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
spaced-out thing,” and all that.

21:45.070 --> 21:49.060
You might start criticizing, because that‘s one of

21:49.130 --> 21:52.210
the qualities of people who are not humble,

21:53.010 --> 21:56.140
that they think they have a capacity to criticize anything.

21:56.230 --> 21:59.190
“Oh, I don’t like this color, it’s no good.”

22:00.030 --> 22:07.060
But the artist has made it with his heart – appreciate it!

22:09.060 --> 22:12.230
So the second point is to appreciate.

22:13.060 --> 22:18.060
Appreciate your life; whatever it is, appreciate,

22:18.160 --> 22:21.050
accept it.

22:21.230 --> 22:23.240
But not with reluctance.

22:24.090 --> 22:28.110
All these mental ideas in the head that art means this

22:28.200 --> 22:32.220
and art means that, has led us to this situation that

22:33.070 --> 22:36.070
we are not going to have any more Rembrandts nor

22:36.160 --> 22:39.140
Michelangelo – finished.

22:39.240 --> 22:42.180
It’s not mental, art is never mental.

22:43.010 --> 22:45.150
It’s coming from inside, and whatever is coming from

22:45.240 --> 22:53.110
inside cannot be compared with outside our ideas.

22:54.040 --> 22:58.080
So the appreciation part – I mean, you can say South

22:58.170 --> 23:03.150
Indians wear very, very loud dresses in our own style.

23:03.200 --> 23:07.240
But to Me they do not.

23:10.060 --> 23:12.220
Some might say something else.

23:13.060 --> 23:16.190
Also I’ve noticed the North Indians must criticize

23:17.020 --> 23:19.200
the South Indians, the South Indians must criticize

23:20.040 --> 23:22.040
the North Indians.

23:22.120 --> 23:26.070
But whatever it is, what is – nobody’s getting

23:26.120 --> 23:31.020
good out of anyone. It’s stupidity, it is stupidity.

23:31.090 --> 23:34.050
But to appreciate

23:36.080 --> 23:41.170
and to accept, you imbibe that.

23:42.020 --> 23:47.150
North Indians cannot like South Indian food, whatever it is.

23:48.020 --> 23:49.210
Whatever you may try, they cannot.

23:50.050 --> 23:51.190
They cannot like their music also.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.050
Now, can you imagine the whole of India divided

23:55.120 --> 23:56.210
into two parts,

23:57.070 --> 24:00.020
and the South Indians cannot like North Indian food nor

24:00.100 --> 24:02.110
the North Indian dancing –

24:02.190 --> 24:05.040
I mean, even in our country.

24:07.010 --> 24:10.220
We’re so divisible, is this country is, that a person

24:11.080 --> 24:15.000
from Rameshwaram won’t like food from Madras,

24:15.080 --> 24:19.040
a person from Madras won’t like the food from Delhi.

24:20.180 --> 24:26.000
So these divisive methods have come through

24:26.200 --> 24:30.200
the innate humility not being you.

24:31.140 --> 24:34.160
If you can enjoy each and everything,

24:35.030 --> 24:37.220
then you are humble.

24:39.170 --> 24:44.200
If you can appreciate each and every expression,

24:45.100 --> 24:50.180
then you are humble.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.130
This humility is a very deep-down character,

24:57.230 --> 25:01.210
because from Mooladhara it comes.

25:05.010 --> 25:08.040
And that is what is Shri Ganesha.

25:08.170 --> 25:12.160
Just imagine, He has a little rat on which He moves about,

25:12.230 --> 25:19.100
He doesn’t have Impala cars or Rolls Royces.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.210
He just moves, with all His big stomach

25:23.020 --> 25:26.210
He moves on a little rat.

25:27.120 --> 25:35.140
No assertion of His powers – He’s so humble,

25:36.010 --> 25:39.090
He’s so sweet.

25:40.020 --> 25:42.170
And He’s the creator of all the rhythms and

25:42.230 --> 25:44.240
things and vibrations.

25:45.090 --> 25:50.230
Without Him, I don’t know what would be this world.

25:51.160 --> 25:57.200
And that’s what we have to really appreciate everywhere,

25:58.130 --> 26:00.010
instead of denouncing this, that.

26:00.190 --> 26:04.100
I mean, like even the color of this room you may not like,

26:04.200 --> 26:05.150
this you may not like.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.090
I mean, there are so many things you don’t like.

26:07.180 --> 26:11.210
Then I have to ask, “What do you like?”

26:12.060 --> 26:15.180
“Baked beans” – all right!

26:24.080 --> 26:26.080
We have to open out ourselves.

26:26.160 --> 26:31.100
With humility you open out, you penetrate, you spread.

26:31.220 --> 26:35.060
Without humility you cannot, because you are objecting

26:35.110 --> 26:39.110
to everything, creating a wall.

26:39.240 --> 26:45.040
Only the humility will make you spread out.

26:45.210 --> 26:49.090
Today, the first day of our tour,

26:50.130 --> 26:58.050
I would request you that you have to be very, very humble.

26:58.150 --> 27:04.070
Understand that humility is extremely simple,

27:04.190 --> 27:07.040
and is beautiful.

27:07.150 --> 27:10.180
You saw that little girl playing veena, such a difficult

27:11.010 --> 27:16.000
Adi Vadyam, primordial instrument, playing with such

27:16.060 --> 27:19.150
sweetness, with such deftness, and so humble.

27:20.030 --> 27:21.120
And she came to Me and she said,

27:21.180 --> 27:24.190
“Mother, what a privilege it was that I got

27:25.020 --> 27:28.230
the opportunity to play before You.”

27:29.120 --> 27:33.230
Just imagine – such a genius.

27:34.060 --> 27:37.180
Another one who met Me last time was a mandolin player

27:38.030 --> 27:41.000
about the same age, maybe younger.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.190
I mean, he is now world-renowned, but when he played

27:45.000 --> 27:47.170
before Me, wouldn’t accept any money, nothing,

27:48.010 --> 27:49.180
he just went into ecstasy.

27:50.020 --> 27:53.130
Even the dancer, she told Me she went into ecstasy

27:53.150 --> 27:54.210
when she saw Me,

27:55.090 --> 27:57.170
and she just danced so well with such vigor.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.080
And she – she had temperature.

28:00.130 --> 28:01.230
She said, “My temperature is gone, everything,

28:01.230 --> 28:05.130
I am perfectly all right.”

28:06.070 --> 28:09.110
Look at those artists. I mean, they have never known Me,

28:09.180 --> 28:11.190
they don’t know anything about Sahaja Yoga.

28:12.050 --> 28:16.010
But what a humble understanding of Divinity –

28:16.070 --> 28:20.120
because they are humble.

28:20.210 --> 28:23.200
Divinity never asserts itself, doesn’t propagate itself,

28:24.060 --> 28:27.020
doesn’t make a big sound.

28:27.120 --> 28:30.010
So now they are here. Come along.

28:30.080 --> 28:32.220
Is that Guido?

28:33.210 --> 28:35.220
Italians have come.

28:38.090 --> 28:42.180
That’s why I delayed the puja today.

28:47.120 --> 28:50.090
Is that Guido? Just call him.

28:55.130 --> 28:59.110
Guido is too humble to come forward.

29:11.090 --> 29:15.160
Come in, come in.

29:18.080 --> 29:27.050
Just move forward a little bit.

29:36.110 --> 29:40.030
May God bless you.

29:41.180 --> 29:44.230
I’ve been waiting for you!

29:50.220 --> 29:55.080
Please, please be seated.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.120
No, no, come! Come along.

30:10.210 --> 30:13.180
Can you – you can all sit in front, there is space.

30:14.030 --> 30:17.030
Just come …. you can all sit there.

30:17.100 --> 30:18.140
I have to keep them pleased, you see,

30:18.220 --> 30:23.130
because I am living in Italy!

30:23.200 --> 30:26.080
Just come on ….

30:32.120 --> 30:35.160
It’s all right, so they might get a part of it.

30:35.240 --> 30:37.140
Just come in front, there.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.160
Or you can sit in the middle, doesn’t matter.

30:40.230 --> 30:46.000
You can sit there wherever you are, yes, you can.

30:52.140 --> 30:57.240
Come forward, come forward, there’s space here.

31:10.010 --> 31:12.180
So I was telling them about Shri Ganesha,

31:12.240 --> 31:17.160
that His essential power comes through His humility;

31:17.220 --> 31:22.020
and that we all have to be extremely humble,

31:22.110 --> 31:26.130
extremely humble, appreciating everything.

31:26.210 --> 31:30.020
Of course, you must make them hear My lecture –

31:30.090 --> 31:32.120
they have already taped it – so they will know

31:32.210 --> 31:35.010
what I am saying today.

31:35.070 --> 31:37.020
But now we can have the puja.

31:37.140 --> 31:42.190
May God bless you.
