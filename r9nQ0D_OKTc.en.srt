1
00:00:04,573 --> 00:00:09,844
You must pray, to God and ask, what you want.

2
00:00:09,924 --> 00:00:14,244
Ask for: Complete satisfaction in my heart,

3
00:00:14,324 --> 00:00:17,944
joy in my heart, bliss in my heart,

4
00:00:18,024 --> 00:00:21,794
so that the whole world becomes blissful.

5
00:00:21,874 --> 00:00:27,436
Give me love, love that I could love the whole world

6
00:00:27,516 --> 00:00:32,109
and that the whole world becomes one in love.

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:51,322
Give salvation to this… humanity.

8
00:00:53,673 --> 00:00:57,786
Which is suffering.

9
00:01:00,568 --> 00:01:04,008
Take me to Your feet.

10
00:01:04,088 --> 00:01:11,519
Cleanse me with Thy love.

11
00:01:19,543 --> 00:01:22,957
Now see if there is God or not?

12
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:29,177
You can feel it within yourself.

13
00:01:29,257 --> 00:01:31,197
He hears you.

14
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:36,157
He understands you.

15
00:01:36,237 --> 00:01:42,862
He’s the glory of all the glory.

16
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:48,078
He loves you.

17
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:50,708
He protects you.

18
00:01:50,788 --> 00:01:53,002
He guides you.

19
00:01:53,082 --> 00:01:59,325
He created you to reveal His love, but accept it.

20
00:02:08,397 --> 00:02:12,250
Any time, any thought is coming, you pray

21
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:19,967
and you will be moving in the waves of that ocean

22
00:02:20,047 --> 00:02:25,485
which is unconscious mind,

23
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:30,127
which starts with thoughtless awareness.

24
00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:10,729
If you cannot become thoughtless, you pray to Him:

25
00:03:10,809 --> 00:03:14,916
Forgive me for what I have done

26
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:20,048
and forgive those who have done harm to me.
