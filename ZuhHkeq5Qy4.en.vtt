00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:10.540
I think some of the Sahaja Yogis were rather
amazed that I accepted Rita’s invitation

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:20.880
to come to this place! Rita has been very
kind to call me here.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:30.490
Every place has its own attractions, as far
as the Divine is concerned.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:42.040
And I knew there must be some very deep seekers
in this place who could be really benefited

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:51.780
if I could visit this place. And I was overjoyed
to arrive here.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:03.370
Now the question about Sahaja Yoga is very
simple to understand. All that is vital is

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:10.870
extremely simple. For example the way we breathe
is so simple. We don’t read any book, we

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.760
don’t do any exercise for that. We don’t
have to go and learn from anyone, we just

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:28.540
do it. In the same way, if our seeking has
some meaning and if we have to find out something

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:36.250
it must be the most vital thing offered. It’s
not just an alternative life. Many people

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.880
have a feeling that the seekers are nothing
but they are finding alternative theories,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:50.220
and to alternate, with the present norms and
conditions – it’s not so.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.290
The time, that is today, the modern times,
are special times described in the ancient

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.010
scriptures in India and also in The Bible
and Koran. In all the scriptures they are

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:15.700
described. In the Koran they are described
as the resurrection time. Christ has many

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:26.500
a time talked about it that: you have to know
My Father forever. That your hands will speak.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:34.680
Lots of descriptions he has given of this
state which you will achieve at a time. As

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:45.260
in life you have seen [that] a tree has to
grow. First it may have just one or two flowers

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.140
but when time comes when the same tree which
has only one or two flowers – about, say,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:58.130
two years back [or] three years back – suddenly
gets into a blossom time and has lots of flowers.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.060
Like that, today is the time of blossom time
of all the seekers.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.180
So many seekers have taken birth today on
this Earth. Especially England it’s described

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.950
by William Blake that these times are going
to come when England is going to become Jerusalem.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:15.250
‘Jerusalem’ means ‘where it will be
pilgrimage.’ For people will think this

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.970
is the Holy Land of God. That people will
come to this Holy Land, to visit this place.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.970
So the people have to be holy, they have to.
It’s not the trees that are going to become

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:38.230
holy, it is not the land that is going to
be holy but it’s the people. Their hearts

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.090
are going to be holy.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.680
Then how do they become holy? What happen
to a person when he really becomes holy? We

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:55.620
talk of saints. We talk of prophets. What
is the difference between these revered people

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:04.760
and ordinary people? There’s only one difference.
The difference is this: that in their attention,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:12.220
in their central nervous system, there is
the light of their Spirit. While for the other

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.290
people, they live in ignorance without this
light of the Spirit.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:24.180
The Spirit exists in every one of us. It is
always there, present, all the time. It’s

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:31.880
Omnipresent. It’s all the time present within
us. But the problem is that we are not aware

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:37.020
of it, that it is not shining in our attention,
in our awareness.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.370
When Gavin told you about the new awareness
it means that the awareness that we have,

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.990
the human awareness, becomes enlightened – a
new awareness – and in that awareness what

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.400
happens is that our Spirit manifests.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.210
Now one may say, Mother it must be a difficult
thing. People have to do so many tapasya,

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:09.610
they have to do so much penance and they have
to go to Himalayas and do all kinds of things,

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.050
stand on their heads for days together, and
how is it that it is working so easily now?

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:19.520
Actually that kind of thing is not needed
today because the time has come.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:31.490
When the time has come it just work out fast,
it works out en masse. Now I am with you here

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.130
but in India, those people who have visited
with me know that there are thousands of people

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:40.050
for every programme I go [to] there. And all
of them get realisation. All of them get realisation.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.860
Means they started feeling the All-pervading
Power for the first time on their hands. “Your

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:54.750
hands will speak.” First time the All-pervading
Power about which Christ has described, every

00:05:54.750 --> 00:06:02.210
scripture has described, you start to feel
it as cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.090
Now this feeling, somebody can say, “Could
be due to this, could be due to that,” because

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.710
we are doubting Thomases sometimes and we
start doubting it. But the thing is, you can

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:20.580
see, in so many people, the rising of the
power from the triangular bone which is called

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.660
as ‘Sacrum’. Surprisingly ‘sacrum’
means ‘sacred’. That means that Greeks

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.190
knew that it is a sacred bone, it’s a sacred
bone. Nowadays this word has no meaning but

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:38.090
it will come back when people realise what
is sacred.

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:46.520
In this bone, the triangular bone, we have
this power called Kundalini settled down.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.500
This residual power which creates us, which
creates the whole being, is still not manifested,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:58.630
it is still sleeping. Because it is the power
of our desire which is the ultimate desire

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:05.420
to become one with the Spirit, to feel the
All-pervading Power, to be the instrument

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.750
of the God.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:15.680
Until this power, or we can say this power
of desire has manifested itself, we are not

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.930
going to be happy people. We can try anything
we like [but we will not].

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:25.210
Now, in the beginning you may say, that so
many prophets came in: Christ came in, all

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:32.380
of them came just to make us ready for this
day when we can be born again. Christ has

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.130
clearly said you have to be born again. Now
who is bothered about it? There are people

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:40.910
I have met who have certified themselves “born
again,” but you can’t certify yourself

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:46.420
as “born again”. “Born again” means
a person who has felt this All-pervading Power.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:55.050
Who can make this All-pervading Power flow
through his being and can manoeuvre it and

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:55.700
understand it.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:04.160
Now this All-pervading Power is the power
that has all the powers that you see: all

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:09.830
this electricity, everything is a part of
that power. That’s the vitality of the whole

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:15.740
Universe, that has created this Universe.
This All-pervading Power that flows when you

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.860
get your realisation, gives you tremendous
powers. But the biggest power it gives you

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:28.740
is to love. God is love, and His power is
the power of love. He really loves us. He

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:35.830
loves us so much that He is the one who wants
to save us. It is He who is anxious to save

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:42.590
His creation. He doesn’t want that His creation
which He has created with such love with such

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:49.080
attention, with such delicate help, out of
which you are the epitome of His creation.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.380
The human beings are the highest, and [for
them] to be destroyed – that He cannot bear.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:09:01.120
And it is His desire that is flowering today
as Sahaja Yoga and that the people are getting

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.440
Self-realisation in such a mass quantities.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:11.900
But the main problem today is that there are
so many in the market that people don’t

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:19.710
know what to do. To begin with, we have churches,
we have mosques, we have temples, we have

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:27.000
all kinds of people selling God, or maybe
talking about God, or saying that, “This

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.470
is God.”

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:34.990
Now these religions came on this Earth, all
the Prophets came on this Earth, to establish

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:43.640
a balance within us, as I told you, to prepare
us for the ultimate. But I have noticed that

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:51.400
without enlightenment whatever is the belief,
whether it is Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism,

00:09:51.400 --> 00:10:01.300
all any isms or Communism or Capitalism or
any sort of thing, it is fanatic belief.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:07.500
The reason is without the light, you can not
see.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:12.730
For example, I come upon this table, I feel
this table [when] there is no light [in the

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:15.830
room]. To me this table is the main thing,
the rest doesn’t exist. To another person

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:21.270
comes here and sees a chair, to him this chair,
nothing [else] exists. Now this myth that

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:27.050
he believes into, he has to establish it.
It’s a myth because he’s not yet enlightened

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:33.820
and he cannot enlighten other people so it’s
a myth. And he has to adhere to that myth

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:44.440
with such glue-like tenacity that created
a great barrier between him and the Truth.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:53.590
Because he has not known the Reality yet.
Reality is very different from what we feel

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.570
today as human beings.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:11:03.040
For example, I will tell you that this Gavin
(Brown) who has today spoke to, met me about

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.280
six, seven years back or we should say more
than that.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:13.550
And first he got his realisation I told him,
“This is All-pervading Power. ” He started

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:17.930
feeling the Cool Breeze. He said, “Mother
how are we to know that it has got telecommunication,

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.760
it has every way of informing us?” I said,
“Alright, what do you want to find out?”

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:28.320
He said, “I want to find out about my father.”
I said, “Alright, you put your hands and

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.380
just ask ‘how is my father?’.” And he
asked this question: immediately he started

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.610
getting the burning on his hand, on here.
Now, these are the centres of your father.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:47.270
These are the centres of your mother. When
he started getting the burning here, he said,

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:51.780
“Mother what is this?” I said it means
you father is down with very bad bronchitis.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.080
His father was in Scotland. I said, “Why
don’t you telephone to him and find out?

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:02.430
It’s very easy to find out.” And when
he telephoned, he found out, his mother told,

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:07.910
that, “Your father is down with very bad
bronchitis.” So that is how the information

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:11.440
comes to us from this All-pervading Power.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:17.540
Now before that, whatever we do, say we talk
of capitalism, we talk of communism. I would

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:34.420
say I am the greatest capitalist because I
have all my powers within my control. I have

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:47.210
all my powers within my control And I am the
greatest communist because I cannot live without

00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:54.080
sharing. I have to share them because otherwise
I cannot enjoy all those powers that I have.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:13:07.840
I really cannot enjoy my own life unless and
until I share it with all of you.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:18.230
I have lots of joy within myself but unless
and until I share my joy with you all, I am

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:23.690
not going to enjoy it. So I am a regular communist.
So all these things you have done, like communism,

00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:26.200
capitalism, communism, democracy are nothing
but the myths of the Reality. Like, sometimes

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.170
you say, “I am my nose, I am my ears, I
am my eyes.” They are all one!

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.830
You do not see the integration. Why? Because
you haven’t yet awakened yourself.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:31.580
Once you are awakened you find “Oh! I am
the whole body.” All this whole body has

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:32.210
all these different parts which we consider,
“This is good, that is good,” but none

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.470
of them have proved to be really perfect.
They are good, but they are not that good.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:35.150
So there must be some way where all these
things integrate, and they integrate at a

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:38.280
point where you become the Spirit because
Spirit is the thing within you which is the

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.000
Collective Being.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:45.060
Now my husband, as you know, is at the UN
system and you have an agency here called

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:52.440
the ‘Maritime Organisation’. And he also
feels that, whatever they are doing on a global

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:58.740
level, on an international level lacks something,
lacks something, in human beings. Because

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:03.130
rationally they understand that the whole
world is the same, that you are my brother

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:10.440
and I am your sister this sort of things but
in their hearts there is still something lurking

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:18.060
because the heart and the head are not integrated.
We believe into so many things but the heart

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.910
and the brain, they are not integrated.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:30.140
How do you find, that the person who is believing
into something but is not doing that? Because

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:37.960
they are not integrated. When the heart and
brain both are absolutely integrated then

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:43.440
you do what you believe into, and [if] you
believe into something, then you do that.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:48.410
Both things go hand in hand, and that’s
how these things that we feel look so funny

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:50.800
with people. They talk so big! They say they,
“We’ll do this for you,” and, “This

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.840
is what we feel,” They make all kinds of
drama. And ultimately you find they have no

00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:02.460
feels about it. But I do not blame them because
they haven’t found their Spirit, which integrates

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:08.900
you completely. And this is the time when
you will get your complete integration in

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:09.420
life.

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:17.750
Now coming to absolute mundane level of things:
the other day, a gentleman of the radio came

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.390
to interview me and he said, “Alright. You
tell tell me that physical, emotional and

00:15:20.390 --> 00:15:23.380
also mental problems can be solved through
Sahaja Yoga.” It’s true. We have cured

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:32.160
cancer. There is one girl today, who came
today from America. She has cured a blood

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:38.250
cancer [case]. Of course it’s true. It can
be cured. With this happening, with the awakening

00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:44.260
of Kundalini you can cure all these diseases.
Heart troubles, all these can be cured. Then

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:48.830
mentally also: many mad people have become
sane people. Many addicts and all sorts of

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:58.410
things have become alright. No doubt! It can
be done. But you have to first of all get

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:03.790
your realisation. Without that, without that
first step, nothing can be achieved.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:08.820
First step is that you get your light in.
Now some people think that we should work

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.300
very hard and we should cleanse ourselves,
we should do this and we should do that and

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.070
then we should take realisation. But why?

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:21.870
Unless and until you get out of yourself you
cannot cleanse yourself, you cannot see yourself,

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:27.110
and you cannot understand because you are
so identified. For example, if you correct

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:31.320
somebody, “You have got ego.” He’ll
just punch you on your nose and say, “What

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.850
do you mean by such a thing? What do you mean,
‘You have an ego’? You are the one who

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:37.050
has the ego! What do you mean by saying such
a thing to me that ‘You have an ego’?”

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:44.180
But when you get your realisation, when the
Kundalini rises, here at this point, where

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:49.080
you see this red mark, behind it, on the optic
chiasma there’s a very subtle centre called

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:58.830
Agya chakra. On this centre resides our Lord
Jesus Christ. And He sucks in your ego and

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:03.970
superego. And when your attention is there,
you can see your ego bloating up like a balloon.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:09.900
You see it and you say, “Oh God! This is
me? Alright.” Nobody minds then if you tell

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.870
them that, “Your Agya chakra is catching.”
Nobody minds it. Because they don’t like

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:16.000
it [to be catching]. They want to have these
vibrations flowing into you.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.610
Then there can be a person with a superego.
A person who is always frightened, who has

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:29.310
fear and who always keeps quiet and goes into
some sort of alcoholism or something, shuns

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:37.100
the society. There could be person like that.
Such a person, also, when he sees light within

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:40.460
himself he becomes normal. Sahaja Yoga is
there to normalise you completely, to make

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.420
you a normal person.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:46.160
But coming to the absolutely mundane thing
like this gentleman asked me a question that,

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:52.100
“What about our unemployment in England?
What do you say? What is the solution you

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.790
give for our unemployment if through Sahaja
Yoga?” I said, “That’s a very great

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:59.800
employment for you?” He said, “How?”
I said, “Let’s see how you got employed.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:06.900
Let us be very practical about it.” You
are over developed people. You have got your

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:14.670
railways done, you have got your aeroplanes
done, all kinds of machineries you have finished

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:21.350
with. I mean, you have done everything and
to add to it now you have computers! Sitting

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:25.890
down here you can move everybody’s nose
and eyes and everything, you don’t have

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:33.690
to move out of here. You can even destroy
the whole world sitting down here. You don’t

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:37.490
have to do anything.

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.030
So you have reached that state where, now,
you must rest. You have had too much development.

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:44.850
So, as a holiday, now you are resting. And
that’s how you are unemployed. But, in the

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:51.780
subtle way, it is a Divine’s working. How?
Science and all these powers have been given

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:58.990
to us, exposed to us because we have to finish
our every day-to-day work and save time. We

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:04.220
have been wearing watches. I don’t think
my grandmother wore any watch all her life.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:08.460
Nor could have been yours also. That time
nobody bothered about time. Time was passing,

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:14.070
nobody bothered about that. But now we are
all the time, “Save the time, save the time,

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:19.690
save the time.” But save for what? Save
for the pub, or save for the ballroom dancing,

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:30.050
or for the quarrelling, or for hitting others
or talking ill of others? Save for yourself.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:45.210
Save for your meditation. Save for your ascent.
And this saving itself, the time that you

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:52.870
have saved, has brought in the birth of so
many seekers on this Earth.

00:19:52.870 --> 00:20:03.490
Now this is the time [that] you have got such
a lot of spare time to you. Why this spare

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:08.940
time has been awarded to you? Is to ascend.
Now you have been employed for worldly things

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:16.200
and worldly materialistic things and all that
but now you are to be employed by God. You

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.740
have to seek His employment. Once you get
your realisation, now we have Sahaja Yogis,

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:32.480
first I first said all Sahaja Yogis must seek
some jobs. They should not be unemployed.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:38.330
But just to make it look normal I told that.
But they are so employed now, they have no

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:46.010
time, they are so busy. They are giving realisation
to people, they are curing people, they are

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:51.730
going round telling them about the message.
They are so busy, they are doing God’s work.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:21:03.610
Now you are no more employed with the government.
You are not employed by any private companies,

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:15.590
but you are employed by God. So, you are free,
you are getting your food alright, you are

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:23.460
getting your pensions alright. Now you work.
I have seen people who are even eighty years

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:30.530
old, ninety years old [that] are doing God’s
work. From India, recently when I went to

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:36.860
America, a gentleman who is about seventy-six
years of age came down to get me from India,

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:45.520
all the way. And he said, “Now I am doing
God’s work, so I am not at all tired, I

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:55.550
am not at all afraid.” He and his wife,
both of them, came to Los Angeles to help

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:56.740
me down there.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:20.980
So now the new employment has to start and
that is the employment of God.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:50.010
You can meet the Sahaja Yogis and ask them.
They are very busy people. They have no time.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:23:07.990
Now my grandchildren who are here, they are
also born-realised people, they are very enlightened

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:26.740
people. And they are very busy. They have
no time for anything. You see, since we have

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.010
come here they have been busy going round
and trying to see wider people. Now, we went

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:42.000
to the airport one day, and this girl was
tying up like this, very fast, she was doing

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:51.740
like this, very fast, like a machine was on.
So her mother asked, “What are you doing?”

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:59.090
She said, “I’m trying to tie up the whole
of airport. You see, they are running helter-skelter

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:07.990
they are all getting mad!” And this action
works out because the hands are flowing [with]

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:18.600
that Divine Power. So this action has a meaning.
And she was working it out like that and she

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:26.040
was going on, and she said, “I have to tie
up all these people, they are so speedy, so

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:35.850
crazy, they are running fast for nothing at
all.” And she was just trying to do that.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.830
They are all the time busy. [If] you talk
to them, “No I’m just I’m busy!” They

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:44.550
will do something here and there and they
try to correct it.

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:53.910
So the new employment one has to take. But
the first of all, the first criteria of this

00:24:53.910 --> 00:25:02.620
new employment is that you should become the
Spirit. If you are not the Spirit, you cannot

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:18.500
do it. So you become the Spirit. Then you
must learn the methods of how to use this

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.100
Divine Power, how should it be done.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:28.410
That’s all! It’s so simple. It’s all
made for you. It’s very easy. Nothing to

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:38.130
work out. But one should not go on thinking
about it. Because it is beyond thought. By

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:48.510
thinking you have built up all these things,
by planning you have done all this. But now

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:58.760
you have to enter into the Realm of God, to
be the citizen of God Empire where he gives

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:07.440
you powers by which you work out the world.
But the whole. And then you really feel your

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:18.650
generosity and your giving powers which are
so great, your forgiving powers, which are

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:27.360
so satisfying. All the great powers will start
feeling once you become that Spirit. And that

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:32.600
is very important, to become the Spirit.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:41.860
Now of course, you can say, there are many
who talk like this. They have to! They have

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:52.730
to talk like this, but there are ways of understanding
how to make out a person who is real and who

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:53.490
is unreal.

00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:59.670
First of all, it is a living happening. It’s
the happening in your evolutionary process.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:10.450
As you have become human being you have to
become a higher being. You are still in transition.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:19.210
You do not know why you are here. You don’t
know your meaning, that’s why you are frustrated,

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:25.070
that’s why you are unhappy. So this has
to happen to all of us.

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:33.160
Now for this, everybody can say, “Alright,
I’ll give you an experience.”

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:44.600
The other day one girl told me that a gentleman
came and told us, “I’ll give you an experience.”

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:50.720
And what experience did he give? She said,
“We became dumbfounded.” I said, “What

00:27:50.720 --> 00:28:00.200
is there [so special] to be dumbfounded?”
Supposing you go to a pub and have a big drink

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:08.570
you can be dumbfounded! What’s so valuable
[in that]? What is an experience? Supposing

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:17.010
you are pricked you might get the experience
of pain or something. Experience is not the

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:24.090
thing, it’s the awareness. What happens
to your awareness is the point. Is your awareness

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:29.690
is enlightened? Has your awareness got the
new dimension by which you understand other

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:35.580
people, the collectively consciousness? Did
you become collective? Are you collectively

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:37.100
conscious? Ask this simple question to yourself.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.290
But it’s very easy to scan out these people
because everything they do is for money or

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:47.570
for women, or something very, very low level
thing. I mean, everybody who is trying to

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:51.940
do something is nothing but money or buildings
or all these things which are not important.

00:28:51.940 --> 00:29:02.880
In the realm of God, what is important is
the joy, is the peace, is the love. And when

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:12.190
we can achieve that Spirit then only we can
talk about it. Before that, if I tell you

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:19.120
a big story, what’s the use? It has to happen,
it has to work out. It’s your own right

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:25.050
to get it. You cannot sell it in the market
because it’s a living process. For example,

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:30.140
supposing there’s a seed which has to grow,
sprout, and it’s a living process, can we

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:37.170
pay money to the seed? “Now you please grow?”
Or a flower which has to become the fruit,

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:43.990
can you pay money to the flower? “Alright,
come along now, become a fruit!” Will it

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:45.150
become? It’s as simple as that.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:52.630
All these living things are done by this All-pervading
Power. We have become human beings also through

00:29:52.630 --> 00:30:00.220
the grace of this All-pervading Power. Even
you have to become higher beings it will be

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:01.330
through that.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:04.860
‘Sahaja’ means ‘born with you’. Also
it means it’s ‘simple’, ‘spontaneous’.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:14.400
Everything living is spontaneous and that’s
why you cannot pay for it, you cannot sell

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:20.860
it in the market. It has nothing to do with
money.

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:29.290
God doesn’t understand money. He never saw
money. He doesn’t know what it is you human

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.530
beings have created, this money, this poverty,
this richness. He has nothing to do with it.

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:43.570
He has created a beautiful world, a beautiful
place for all of you live and He has created

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:59.070
you to enjoy it. But if you have made complications
and hangs-up and you are so complicated it’s

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:09.380
better to get out of it and become a simple
personality. To become a simple personality

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:13.970
also you have to get to that level which is
the Spirit.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:18.480
And that is what Sahaja yoga is today.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:24.600
As Gavin has told you that you have to put
hands towards me.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:32.070
Now I must say, I must confess that that’s
my job. I have to accept it. But it should

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:38.360
not in any way hurt your ego. Because the
other day somebody told me, “Why you Mother?”

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:44.670
I said, “Please come along! I’ll be very
happy.

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:52.690
If you can do it nothing like it! I’ll be
very happy. Now see, I have a good family,

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:56.340
a very good husband, my family, my children,
my grandchildren and they are happy people.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:01.020
Actually yesterday he was not well also so
much and he didn’t want me to come here

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.900
but I said, “No I must go to this place.
It’s definite I must go.” And I managed

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:08.470
to come here. And he also realises how important
it is to transform people. But it’s my job

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:12.220
what can I do? You see, if it is my job are
you going to crucify me for that? I have been

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:18.840
really asked to do this job and I am doing
it in my own humble way just to give you something.

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:31.070
I have to just give you. I have nothing to
take from you. I am standing at an end where

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:42.360
I cannot take anything. I can just give you
my love and you should just accept it. Is

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:48.720
there any harm in accepting somebody’s love?
Which you cannot pay for.

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:55.940
But once you get realisation, once you are
enlightened, you can enlighten other people.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:03.230
Like one light which is enlightened can enlighten
another person and when that person is enlightened,

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.320
can enlighten another person.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:09.220
It’s simple as that. I was born as an enlightened
personality. And I was aware of it. And then

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:12.270
my father told me, very frankly that, “Now
you find out a method by which you can give

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:13.400
a en-masse realisation. Because otherwise
if you speak it will become another Bible,

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:22.250
and people will fight; it will be another
Judaism, and they will fight, another Islam,

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:25.720
and they will fight. It’s better that you
give them realisation. Because [if] somebody

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:33.220
is born on the tenth storey and he talks of
the tenth storey and people on the ground

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:35.030
do not rise. First they are jealous or they
are angry or they think the man is mad and

00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:35.740
they will do all kinds of things like crucifixion,
giving poison, torturing the saints and all

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:36.150
that.” He said, “Nothing doing! First
of all you make them rise at least two storeys

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:36.970
or three storeys. Let them feel that there
is something beyond. Once they start feeling

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:37.880
there’s something beyond that they have
to achieve it in their awareness then only

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.580
they will understand that there is God and
there is Divinity.”

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:50.190
Blind faith is no use. In the same way, denying
God is also no use. You must see and witness

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:50.660
this happening and then, once you become the
Self, you will understand God. Before becoming

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.140
the Self you cannot understand God, that’s
why even Buddha didn’t talk about God. He

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.720
said, “You better not talk of God. Once
you talk of God, again hypocrisy starts.”

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.390
So he said, “Let’s talk of the Self-realisation
only. Once they get their Self-realisation,

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.920
then I’ll talk about God.” But you know,
he didn’t live that long to tell people.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:58.840
Actually, in his life time, he couldn’t
give realisation to many people.

00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:05.300
Luckily I am in England. It’s all arranged,
I think. I have to be here because this is

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:10.470
going to be the Jerusalem. And I have been
struggling with English people quite a lot!

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:12.340
And I had six people with me for four years
– you won’t believe – and I was struggling

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.010
with them, with the six people. But they were
managed and they are now the foundation of

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:14.150
Sahaja Yoga in England.

00:34:14.150 --> 00:34:14.650
English people are wise people. They are scholarly
people. They don’t rush to conclusions.

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:17.290
They are sensible people. But a kind of an
inertia is settled because of the experiences

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:18.710
of the past. Experiences of the religious
people, experiences of the fake gurus, experiences

00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:20.500
of the other experiments that people have
done and they are really now fed up and fagged

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:20.720
out that, “We are not going to go in for
anything more!”

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:21.250
But supposing you are seeking a diamond and
ultimately find it.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:21.750
Won’t you ask for it? Because you have been
seeking that only. So why not get to it and

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.780
do it?

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:21.950
No use identifying yourself with something:
with some organisation, with some cult, with

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:22.070
some sort of a misguided religion, or religious
behaviours.

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:22.320
Best is to be your Self. And then, you will
be surprised, your hands will speak. You yourself

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:28.010
will know who is the real who is the unreal.

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:29.650
Now there is one drawback that people feel
that, if you start jumping, you have become,

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:31.140
you are, blessed by Holy Ghost! If you start
talking something non-sensical, you have been

00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:31.540
blessed by Holy Ghost.

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.220
How can that be? We can always jump. It’s
not difficult. Is it difficult to jump? Anybody

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:34.510
can start jumping. Anybody can start saying
something like that. Now, this misunderstanding

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:34.800
has come, because

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.470
‘Saint’ Paul I think said something, which
he should not have said because he was not

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:35.470
realised soul. And he had no business to say
that the Holy Ghost made them jump. Actually

00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:38.110
this is done by the [dead] spirits. People
can mesmerise you and can make you jump. They

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:40.880
can mesmerise you. You have seen so many cases
where mass hypnosis has taken place. People

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.040
are just hypnotised to become the slaves of
these people, to give them money,

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:42.980
to give them Rolls Royces, to give them all
kinds of useless things.

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:45.520
So we must understand that this happening
is a living happening. You cannot pull out

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:45.820
your Kundalini like that. You cannot pull
out the primule, the germinating seedling

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:46.190
from the seed. You cannot pull it out [and
say], “Now come along now! You grow.”

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.830
It has to grow by itself. In the same way,
the happening of the Kundalini, in so many

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:54.940
people you can see. If you come to my programme
later on, you will be able to see. That you

00:34:54.940 --> 00:35:02.180
can see the pulsation of the Kundalini in
the Sacrum, you can see the pulsation rising.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.030
You can feel it on the fontanel bone area.
And once this opens out, you can feel the

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:05.870
cool breeze coming out of your head. You can
feel it, the cool breeze, coming out. And

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:08.440
also then you start feeling the cool breeze
in your hand.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:13.320
Now this you cannot do! No one can do it.
Something has happened to you. And then once

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:18.070
you get it, if you start practicing it, you
will be amazed what powers you have got. Because,

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:22.910
supposing, even if I have powers, or if I
have money and I don’t know how to spend

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:25.010
it, I don’t know what the money is, what
this paper means – what’s the use? In

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.400
the same way, when you get this, you have
to give it to others. You have to look after

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:25.680
others. You have to impart this beauty to
others. In doing that you do not get into

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:25.820
any trouble, you do not suffer from anything.
On the contrary you feel so elated. And the

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:25.830
fulfilment of your being comes into you that
there’s some meaning to our lives. Something

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:25.830
that we are doing which is so substantial,
so living. We are doing the work of God.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:25.840
May God bless you all.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:25.840
It’s such a big subject that, in this short
time, I cannot explain every aspect of it.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:25.850
It’s a very, very wide thing. But now I
can only say that there are about six [to]

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:25.860
severn hundred lectures I have given only
in England and I don’t know how many in

00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:25.870
India. Still they say, “Mother, always you
say something new. I just don’t understand.”

00:35:25.870 --> 00:35:25.880
But whatever it is, knowledge by words is
of no use. Knowledge should be your own which

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:25.890
should come to you as light. For example,
in a library, if you get a way of knowing

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:25.890
every book, just by the subtle entering into
it, or penetration into it, you [will] become

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:25.900
the knowledge. So best thing is to become
the knowledge instead of just knowing through

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:25.910
me and understanding it through me, which
you can do it. You are quite capable of doing

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.910
it and it can happen to all of you.

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920
I wish this evening especially it should happen.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:25.930
They say it is a small village. And to me,
small or big doesn’t matter. It’s how

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:25.930
many are there [who are] genuine seekers,
who are genuinely seeking God, who are seeking

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:28.980
their Spirit? That’s the most important
thing for me. Even there is one person like

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:35.430
that I’ll go to that place. Whether it’s
one house, or one village, or a big city,

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.550
makes no difference to me.
