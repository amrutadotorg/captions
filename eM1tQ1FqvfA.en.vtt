00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.286
Shri Mataji: Suddenly become little cold, isn’t it? Yogini: Yes

00:00:09.487 --> 00:00:11.487
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:00:11.846 --> 00:00:14.053
What about him, did he have tea? Reporter: Yup.

00:00:14.254 --> 00:00:17.753
Don't mind our photographer is just sitting here, getting some photographs.

00:00:17.954 --> 00:00:20.500
Yogini: Would you like a cup of tea or coffee?

00:00:21.194 --> 00:00:23.726
Shri Mataji: A little loudly? Yogini: Would you like a cup of tea or coffee?

00:00:23.927 --> 00:00:25.760
Shri Mataji: Yes, I don’t mind. What about him?

00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:28.460
Photographer: I’m all right, thank you, thank you. Yogini: He preferred not to take.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.413
Shri Mataji: All right. Yogini: Cup of tea? Shri Mataji: Cup of tea.

00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:39.420
R: So, how was the tour going? Your tour in Australia going so far?

00:00:39.674 --> 00:00:41.620
Shri Mataji: So far? R: Yes.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.386
Shri Mataji: It was very good in Brisbane,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.460
except for the reporter who came and could not get his Realisation, and he was very disappointed.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.380
R: Can you just explain to me, it’s quite a basic question, what exactly Self Realisation is?

00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:02.340
Shri Mataji: I will explain.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.056
You see, we have reached a stage of human awareness now.

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.716
But that’s not the absolute.

00:01:16.563 --> 00:01:18.700
If it was absolute,

00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:24.660
then there would have been no problem.

00:01:27.743 --> 00:01:30.340
All the human problems come in

00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:33.830
-it's all right, all right. Never mind.

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.349
Because we have not yet got to that stage.

00:01:45.243 --> 00:01:50.180
Now, that stage which I’m talking about

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:54.220
is Self Realisation, where you become the Spirit.

00:01:56.876 --> 00:01:59.020
That in your awareness,

00:02:01.846 --> 00:02:04.246
the light of spirit comes in.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.300
The light of spirit comes in.

00:02:08.956 --> 00:02:11.042
Without that light

00:02:14.563 --> 00:02:16.820
we have no discrimination

00:02:21.356 --> 00:02:23.420
and

00:02:25.275 --> 00:02:29.060
we have selfishness,

00:02:32.293 --> 00:02:36.580
temptations, habits,

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.660
all kind of dominations on us.

00:02:45.563 --> 00:02:47.620
But when you become the Spirit,

00:02:55.596 --> 00:02:59.060
then you feel complete.

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.820
R: How did you find Self Realisation?

00:03:06.328 --> 00:03:08.540
Shri Mataji: I was born with it.

00:03:15.141 --> 00:03:20.860
But it was a process so far only for few people.

00:03:24.347 --> 00:03:27.340
But I found out a method by which

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.460
thousands could get Self Realisation at the same time.

00:03:36.283 --> 00:03:38.283
R: How?

00:03:40.636 --> 00:03:42.736
Shri Mataji: We have within us the power

00:03:46.996 --> 00:03:49.180
which is called as the Kundalini.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.140
Kundalini is the power, residual power.

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:01.620
Now, this has to be awakened.

00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:04.700
R: Sorry? Shri Mataji: This has to be awakened.

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:13.620
It’s a living process

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.580
because it is the epitome of our evolution.

00:04:28.183 --> 00:04:30.620
Like you sprout the seed.

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:38.340
It works spontaneously

00:04:43.447 --> 00:04:45.660
but you must have

00:04:49.693 --> 00:04:52.180
that divine power within you

00:04:53.407 --> 00:04:55.419
to achieve it.

00:04:56.243 --> 00:04:58.740
Photographer: Excuse me, can you just move this?

00:04:59.856 --> 00:05:04.249
Just wanted to move it a little way, thank you.

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.449
Shri Mataji: Now? Photographer: Thank you.

00:05:09.187 --> 00:05:11.187
Thank you.

00:05:12.696 --> 00:05:19.180
Shri Mataji: So, you have everything within you.

00:05:19.773 --> 00:05:23.660
And the time has come also, I call it the blossom time.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.340
And that’s how many are getting Realisation.

00:05:39.023 --> 00:05:44.020
R: So, for example, how could I find out Self Realisation?

00:05:44.336 --> 00:05:47.900
Shri Mataji: You can also get Realisation. R: How? How would I do that?

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.045
Shri Mataji: It’s very simple. R: Tapping into this energy.

00:05:51.246 --> 00:05:54.220
Shri Mataji: No, no, just you have to put your hands towards Me.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.940
But with the reporters, they are always in a hurry, you see, they’re not in a relaxed mood.

00:05:59.141 --> 00:06:03.059
That’s one problem, isn’t it true? R: The work, yes it's true.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.789
Shri Mataji: And that’s what I found, that when the reporters say that we want to have Realisation,

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.950
they couldn’t get it and the photographer had got it.

00:06:14.363 --> 00:06:20.460
It’s very surprising. So, there’s nothing wrong with any reporter as such.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.140
And he asked Me, “What’s wrong with me?” And then I say nothing is wrong, but you are in a hurry, that’s the trouble is.

00:06:26.376 --> 00:06:32.220
So, this is something you need little peace to get it.

00:06:36.706 --> 00:06:40.340
And more, in the collective it works much faster.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:46.820
R: When's it in a group of people? Shri Mataji: Yes, there are many, many of them, works better.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:53.623
R: Right. Do you find people sceptical about your work, your teachings?

00:06:53.823 --> 00:06:57.740
Shri Mataji: Yes, they are always to begin with, it’s all right

00:06:58.723 --> 00:07:01.029
because that's their freedom.

00:07:02.366 --> 00:07:06.073
They have to have their freedom, if they have to achieve the

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.259
complete freedom.

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:18.100
People who are in bondage cannot receive the freedom isn't it.

00:07:21.522 --> 00:07:26.820
R: So how do you see the future of your work? You obviously travel around, teaching.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.860
Shri Mataji: This point I would like to clarify little more, the one you’ve asked just now about.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.896
What I would to say is that when you’re doubting someone,

00:07:37.816 --> 00:07:40.460
then you must have a scientific attitude.

00:07:41.163 --> 00:07:46.140
Is to keep your mind open,

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.053
not to close it down.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.020
Because this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:07:59.887 --> 00:08:03.420
You know the knowledge of the tree, I should say, tree of life.

00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:12.180
It’s like a hypothesis whatever I put before you is like a hypothesis,

00:08:13.333 --> 00:08:17.420
and then, if it is proved, you have to accept.

00:08:18.386 --> 00:08:24.620
But if your mind is closed, is very difficult to force it on anyone.

00:08:26.573 --> 00:08:29.420
Actually, you have to ask for it.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.980
R: Yes. Shri Mataji: All right?

00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:37.740
Now, what was the next question you asked me? R: The future.

00:08:38.199 --> 00:08:43.257
Shri Mataji: Future. R: What would you like to do, carry on touring because your 64 now?

00:08:43.643 --> 00:08:49.020
Shri Mataji: Yes, I think I have to do it for some time more.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.020
Things are working out well and

00:08:56.067 --> 00:08:58.073
many young people

00:08:58.586 --> 00:09:02.593
who were lost into various searches

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.100
are coming around.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.700
Most of the false gurus are exposed.

00:09:12.026 --> 00:09:17.030
These evangelistic people and all that sort of people are also now getting exposed.

00:09:20.523 --> 00:09:23.180
And so many conditionings

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.860
that they had are dropping down.

00:09:34.173 --> 00:09:37.180
And I’m sure, within ten years time

00:09:42.266 --> 00:09:45.220
we will be able to establish Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:52.700
that people will have to understand

00:09:55.033 --> 00:09:57.700
that it is something

00:09:59.627 --> 00:10:02.780
that will transform the whole world.

00:10:05.646 --> 00:10:11.100
And that’s the only way the solution will come to all our problems.

00:10:14.286 --> 00:10:19.860
R: What do your followers, I’ve hesitated to use the word, the people you’ve taught,

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:25.100
what they get out to your teachings, have they -did they come back to you and say it's changed their life?

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:29.380
Shri Mataji: Yes. Firstly they become very peaceful people.

00:10:32.806 --> 00:10:34.806
Say we talk of peace,

00:10:35.527 --> 00:10:39.620
but here’s no peace within, so what’s the use of talking about peace?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.660
They become very righteous and virtuous.

00:10:57.293 --> 00:11:00.660
I don’t have to tell them don’t do this or don’t do that,

00:11:03.867 --> 00:11:06.740
they themselves become powerful.

00:11:09.986 --> 00:11:15.340
Then they are very satisfied souls,

00:11:19.786 --> 00:11:22.660
they do not hanker after anything anymore.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.500
R: Have you been meeting

00:11:25.946 --> 00:11:30.630
people on this trip? That you taught, on your previous…?

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:35.660
Shri Mataji: On the street? R: No here, because you have been to Australia three times before, haven’t you?

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.683
Shri Mataji: Yes, R: Have you met any old friends that you taught,

00:11:40.123 --> 00:11:43.860
coming back to you saying how much they’re enjoying life since you taught them about the Yoga?

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.253
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, all of them.

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:50.860
All of them write to Me letters after letters.

00:11:52.207 --> 00:11:55.700
R: Got many friends in Australia? Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, many, many.

00:11:59.407 --> 00:12:02.780
But they get the power to give Realisation to others.

00:12:06.227 --> 00:12:10.060
We have no organization as such, no organization.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.780
And so many are married in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.340
R: Oh really? Shri Mataji: Oh, they are very happily married,

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.060
and have very sweet children, we had seventy one marriages this year.

00:12:24.739 --> 00:12:27.430
R: Where, were any particular countries? Shri Mataji: In India.

00:12:27.631 --> 00:12:31.979
R: In India? Shri Mataji: They were from various countries, international marriages you can call it.

00:12:35.186 --> 00:12:37.830
R: So you bring these couples together? Shri Mataji: Yes,

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:43.589
and they meet each other and they like each other then they marry

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:48.300
and they are very successful marriages, very successful.

00:12:50.733 --> 00:12:55.246
And the children also are very beautiful children,

00:12:55.446 --> 00:13:01.700
are Realised children, but intelligent and very disciplined.

00:13:04.146 --> 00:13:06.580
R: You brought any Australian couples together?

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.460
Shri Mataji: So many. So many are sitting here, I think.

00:13:16.313 --> 00:13:18.420
R: You met through the organization?

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.760
Yogini: Yes. Shri Mataji: Australians are the best

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.820
I may say foreign Sahaja Yogis, what you say,

00:13:24.033 --> 00:13:28.060
from India we call them they are the best, among all of them, will you?

00:13:32.118 --> 00:13:34.118
R: Excellent.

00:13:34.487 --> 00:13:38.340
You mentioned, I’ve read, read something said that

00:13:38.613 --> 00:13:42.987
your Yoga could cure diabetes, AIDS? It helps?

00:13:43.188 --> 00:13:44.837
Shri Mataji: Yes, many diseases.

00:13:45.037 --> 00:13:48.740
R: In what way? Shri Mataji: Even we can work to AIDS we can say,

00:13:50.166 --> 00:13:52.180
one can work it out.

00:13:53.726 --> 00:13:59.020
But people come to us at such a stage when they are absolutely lost and they have no will power.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.580
Then it’s difficult.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.330
R: But AIDS is incurable, they say.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.210
Shri Mataji: No, it’s not incurable, it is quite curable.

00:14:07.411 --> 00:14:08.700
R: How?

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.662
Shri Mataji: It is caused by the copper I think, in the blood.

00:14:12.863 --> 00:14:16.632
And the copper gets this virus on top of this.

00:14:16.833 --> 00:14:20.020
And this virus is carried by the copper in the body.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.460
If you can neutralize the copper in the body

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.053
through some gold.

00:14:28.419 --> 00:14:34.020
In India we have methods of making gold soluble

00:14:36.147 --> 00:14:39.180
and with that maybe that

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:45.460
this copper can be covered with that gold and can become untarnishable

00:14:46.879 --> 00:14:49.700
and this virus can be thrown out of the body.

00:14:55.446 --> 00:14:59.220
But after that one has to lead a sane life, that’s the problem.

00:15:09.133 --> 00:15:13.459
R: So, you’re looking forward to meeting more people in Australia,

00:15:13.659 --> 00:15:15.772
teaching more people here?

00:15:15.973 --> 00:15:18.597
Shri Mataji: I beg your pardon. R: You’re looking forward teaching more people?

00:15:18.797 --> 00:15:22.819
Shri Mataji: Yes, I hope so, this year there will be some more people will be coming

00:15:23.093 --> 00:15:25.923
and learning this method of transformation

00:15:26.124 --> 00:15:29.030
and giving transformation to so many.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:36.043
R: When did you discover your powers? How old were you when you discovered you had powers?

00:15:36.499 --> 00:15:38.883
Shri Mataji: I knew it from my childhood

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:45.720
but this one I had to discover, one thing: how to give Realisation to many?

00:15:53.053 --> 00:15:59.820
So I’ve worked out all the permutations and combinations, and then I found out this method.

00:16:01.813 --> 00:16:04.860
R: Very successful method. Shri Mataji: Very successful.

00:16:08.479 --> 00:16:11.820
R: OK, that’s fine, that's for honestly was great.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.893
Shri Mataji: All right? R: Yes, it was lovely.

00:16:14.094 --> 00:16:18.227
Photographer: Could I do a picture next door? Shri Mataji: All right. Photographer: Just in there?

00:16:20.333 --> 00:16:23.426
R: Thank you very much for talking to me. Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. R: It was great.

00:16:23.626 --> 00:16:25.426
Shri Mataji: May God bless you! R: Very interesting.

00:16:25.627 --> 00:16:27.576
Do come to my program! R: Yes, it’s on Thursday and Friday?

00:16:27.777 --> 00:16:31.696
Shri Mataji: You must because it must be authentically said, isn’t it?

00:16:32.793 --> 00:16:37.123
Once you get Realisation you can be authentic about it.
