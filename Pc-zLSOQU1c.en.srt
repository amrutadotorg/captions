1
00:00:09,933 --> 00:00:16,532
You can't imagine how a Mother who has so many beautiful children

2
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:21,497
sees them in such joyous mood

3
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:28,315
with their families, their children, nicely settled down.

4
00:00:29,314 --> 00:00:35,694
It's very satisfying to see you all so much

5
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:42,913
in joy and complete oneness with the Divine.

6
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:48,363
One has to realize only one thing:

7
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,728
that though you are many,

8
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:57,267
still compared to the population of this world, we are very few

9
00:00:57,517 --> 00:01:03,697
who really know the true knowledge, the real knowledge.

10
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:07,817
You are the people who are knowledgeable, no doubt,

11
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:16,506
but also knowledge which is not being adorned with truth

12
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:20,948
or which is not the true knowledge has no meaning.

13
00:01:21,276 --> 00:01:26,392
All that vanishes into thin air because it is artificial.

14
00:01:27,425 --> 00:01:31,951
By your Kundalini awakening you all have achieved

15
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:35,849
that state where we can say you know.

16
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:39,487
You know what is the real knowledge is,

17
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:45,229
but think of the people who do not know what knowledge is.

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,713
We take, for example we say that

19
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:55,183
our knowledge is nothing but love,

20
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:58,188
but one should understand the discrimination.

21
00:01:58,188 --> 00:02:02,711
The knowledge that is love within you

22
00:02:02,711 --> 00:02:07,239
is just emitting out from your being.

23
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:11,511
You don't have to assert, you don't have to think,

24
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:16,738
you don't have to read some sort of a poetry or go into some romantic mood

25
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:24,055
just pure love which emits, and this is the knowledge also.

26
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,626
How you have to relate it is this way:

27
00:02:31,357 --> 00:02:37,975
the knowledge that you have about yourself is evident,

28
00:02:38,204 --> 00:02:41,403
is absolutely expressed on your fingertips,

29
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:43,945
and about others also.

30
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:47,754
You know about others and about yourself.

31
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:56,902
This is the greatest subtle knowledge you have.

32
00:02:56,902 --> 00:02:58,831
No one knows like that.

33
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:04,935
Apart from you people, no one knows about themselves or about others.

34
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,033
So this knowledge that has come to you,

35
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:13,530
which is extremely subtle,

36
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,426
extremely secretive, absolutely secret.

37
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:21,902
If you know about somebody, you know.

38
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:26,913
Others do not know that you know about them,

39
00:03:26,913 --> 00:03:31,843
and so this knowledge that you have got is nothing but love.

40
00:03:31,843 --> 00:03:37,366
It's very difficult to make knowledge and love put together,

41
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:41,092
because our idea of knowledge is very different,

42
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:43,651
what we read from the books.

43
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:46,709
How can you love from the books?

44
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:49,628
What love means, our attachments

45
00:03:49,628 --> 00:03:53,354
to us, in ignorance we get attached

46
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:58,473
to people, to children, to family, to things.

47
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:06,960
By getting attachment it is proved that we do not have the knowledge.

48
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,397
If you have the knowledge then all attachments

49
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:14,636
should just drop out and you should become a global personality,

50
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:16,539
a drop in the ocean.
