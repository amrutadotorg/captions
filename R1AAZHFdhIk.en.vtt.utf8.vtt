00:17.040 --> 00:25.750
what does look after all of us his

00:22.870 --> 00:28.840
compassion his love he has created as he

00:25.750 --> 00:30.670
has made a beautiful human being out of

00:28.840 --> 00:32.500
us within us he has placed all these

00:30.670 --> 00:34.270
centers he has placed the Kundalini

00:32.500 --> 00:36.520
within us and the Kundalini has to rise

00:34.270 --> 00:40.059
you have to get realization all that is

00:36.520 --> 00:44.890
so no doubt all this has to work out

00:40.059 --> 00:49.650
that's also it the truth is but still

00:44.890 --> 00:53.890
one must know that he not in your hand

00:49.650 --> 00:56.829
you are in his hand there are many

00:53.890 --> 00:58.930
people who pray to God give me promotion

00:56.829 --> 01:02.230
Oh God

00:58.930 --> 01:03.760
you have to give me promotion and then

01:02.230 --> 01:08.259
if he doesn't give this God is not

01:03.760 --> 01:08.979
helpful to me why has he not given me

01:08.259 --> 01:11.880
promotion

01:08.979 --> 01:15.040
you should not cheap in God like that

01:11.880 --> 01:18.399
God is the one who is almighty who has

01:15.040 --> 01:21.000
created all this universe he has created

01:18.399 --> 01:25.500
you and he has created you for a purpose

01:21.000 --> 01:29.410
and that purpose is something supreme

01:25.500 --> 01:31.899
that's not ordinary purpose the way you

01:29.410 --> 01:32.550
think him to be he's not an ordinary

01:31.899 --> 01:36.039
person

01:32.550 --> 01:37.959
he's supreme and he will give you

01:36.039 --> 01:41.470
something that is supreme supposing you

01:37.959 --> 01:46.869
go to see some king he will not get give

01:41.470 --> 01:51.369
you one piece really he may give you a

01:46.869 --> 01:54.009
diamond but if you want to ask anything

01:51.369 --> 01:58.840
from God then you must ask for the

01:54.009 --> 02:04.360
supreme now what is the supreme the

01:58.840 --> 02:06.220
supreme is to know him unless and until

02:04.360 --> 02:11.050
you know yourself you are not going to

02:06.220 --> 02:13.270
know him he has placed within you that

02:11.050 --> 02:17.170
instrument by which you first know

02:13.270 --> 02:22.240
yourself once you know yourself through

02:17.170 --> 02:25.120
yourself you know him but the first

02:22.240 --> 02:27.730
important thing is that your attention

02:25.120 --> 02:29.760
has to be on him there is a very

02:27.730 --> 02:33.540
different thing to

02:29.760 --> 02:36.379
attention on God and to have a blind

02:33.540 --> 02:41.459
faith in God these two things are

02:36.379 --> 02:44.250
absolutely far apart to have faith in

02:41.459 --> 02:46.830
God means I have already told you all

02:44.250 --> 02:51.170
the silly things we do in the name of

02:46.830 --> 02:57.709
faith but to have your attention on God

02:51.170 --> 03:01.049
is to ask when am I going to be myself

02:57.709 --> 03:04.709
when are you going to accept me as a

03:01.049 --> 03:07.319
citizen of your kingdom when are you

03:04.709 --> 03:10.230
going to use me as your instrumental

03:07.319 --> 03:12.329
Lord this should be your attention if

03:10.230 --> 03:16.769
your attention is like that and if you

03:12.329 --> 03:20.040
are really of pure nature about it it

03:16.769 --> 03:22.019
will work out it works out this is the

03:20.040 --> 03:27.209
only thing that is needed in sahaja yoga

03:22.019 --> 03:30.299
is a clean heart ask for it to desire

03:27.209 --> 03:33.000
for it but today we have to understand

03:30.299 --> 03:36.500
one thing that the essence is within us

03:33.000 --> 03:40.349
for example innocence is absolutely pure

03:36.500 --> 03:44.700
within us it is absolutely pure in its

03:40.349 --> 03:47.190
own form it is absolutely pure but when

03:44.700 --> 03:52.590
it is reflected through our medium it

03:47.190 --> 03:55.290
gets all the way you are the way you

03:52.590 --> 03:59.099
express it it gets spoiled if you are a

03:55.290 --> 04:01.919
cunning person the innocence cannot be

03:59.099 --> 04:04.079
para fest it cannot be manifested you

04:01.919 --> 04:06.660
are in ourselves whatever God has placed

04:04.079 --> 04:09.690
within you is completely darkened

04:06.660 --> 04:13.829
because you cannot reflect it back there

04:09.690 --> 04:19.200
is no manifestation about it why it

04:13.829 --> 04:21.510
happens if you are pure if you are all

04:19.200 --> 04:24.810
right the innocence is all right then

04:21.510 --> 04:26.699
why it is not manifested through you why

04:24.810 --> 04:29.310
these cunningness can stop that

04:26.699 --> 04:31.050
innocence or any other essences that are

04:29.310 --> 04:34.500
within you which you know which exists

04:31.050 --> 04:38.520
on different chakras we must think about

04:34.500 --> 04:42.840
it why it happens that even after

04:38.520 --> 04:43.380
realization we cannot properly manifest

04:42.840 --> 04:50.250
our in

04:43.380 --> 04:53.460
since our primordial powers which are

04:50.250 --> 04:57.300
within us in absolute purest form why

04:53.460 --> 05:01.590
what happens with us the trouble is with

04:57.300 --> 05:04.410
our attention when you became human

05:01.590 --> 05:06.630
beings you were given full freedom to

05:04.410 --> 05:11.040
put your attention on to anything you

05:06.630 --> 05:16.770
wanted say if you want you can put your

05:11.040 --> 05:19.590
attention on to any subject so I receive

05:16.770 --> 05:21.420
a telephone so I put my attention to it

05:19.590 --> 05:23.400
now I can go on identifying with it

05:21.420 --> 05:25.260
thinking about it all my attention will

05:23.400 --> 05:27.120
be enveloped and I will not pay

05:25.260 --> 05:33.240
attention to anything else that is

05:27.120 --> 05:35.820
happening the attention is so mobile it

05:33.240 --> 05:37.980
has no base as if the whole thing like a

05:35.820 --> 05:40.470
journey goes and gets attached to a

05:37.980 --> 05:42.750
thing I mean if you waste your attention

05:40.470 --> 05:48.420
on foolish nonsensical things what's

05:42.750 --> 05:53.400
going to happen so this is how we put

05:48.420 --> 05:55.530
our attention on to absolutely useless

05:53.400 --> 05:58.080
things sometimes known to many different

05:55.530 --> 06:02.730
things also we may put our attention to

05:58.080 --> 06:05.930
anything that we think requires our

06:02.730 --> 06:09.360
attention but do you have your yourself

06:05.930 --> 06:14.690
esteem if you have then where should be

06:09.360 --> 06:19.970
your attention it should be on yourself

06:14.690 --> 06:25.050
where is yourself now it is God Almighty

06:19.970 --> 06:31.470
is a part of that great primordial P

06:25.050 --> 06:33.540
your attention should be on that after

06:31.470 --> 06:35.660
realization your attention should be in

06:33.540 --> 06:41.250
your heart

06:35.660 --> 06:44.190
on your spirit which is the part of God

06:41.250 --> 06:47.640
Almighty if your attention is on your

06:44.190 --> 06:50.910
spirit you will be amazed how your

06:47.640 --> 06:53.490
attention will act you seem like a jolly

06:50.910 --> 06:55.350
which is attached to a point it may

06:53.490 --> 06:57.270
little bit get disturbed again it will

06:55.350 --> 06:59.370
settle down again it will graduate

06:57.270 --> 07:02.520
disturbed it will settle now it will not

06:59.370 --> 07:07.290
hang on to any point and will not bother

07:02.520 --> 07:09.900
you so to put all your senses properly

07:07.290 --> 07:13.650
first of all put your attention to your

07:09.900 --> 07:15.300
heart and through you spirit because

07:13.650 --> 07:18.000
that's your absolute point which you

07:15.300 --> 07:20.730
have discovered but it doesn't happen

07:18.000 --> 07:23.570
with many people the trouble is when

07:20.730 --> 07:26.250
Kundalini Rises she gives two kinds of

07:23.570 --> 07:29.730
experiences one is called as shambhavi

07:26.250 --> 07:32.760
another called is Shakti shambhavi is

07:29.730 --> 07:36.900
the feeling of the Shambu is the shiva

07:32.760 --> 07:40.710
in the heart means God Almighty but the

07:36.900 --> 07:43.560
other is shift now with Western people

07:40.710 --> 07:46.290
it is the other because you know your

07:43.560 --> 07:49.320
problems you have used your powers for

07:46.290 --> 07:52.230
all kinds of ramblings in your mental

07:49.320 --> 07:54.270
efforts everything will sit down alright

07:52.230 --> 07:59.310
let us discuss realization what are you

07:54.270 --> 08:02.280
going to discuss what are you going to

07:59.310 --> 08:06.390
discuss about realization did you get

08:02.280 --> 08:10.290
your realization by discussion how to

08:06.390 --> 08:13.340
meditate you have to go within

08:10.290 --> 08:15.840
yourselves see the world work out within

08:13.340 --> 08:18.600
you cannot talk about it you cannot

08:15.840 --> 08:22.950
discuss it you cannot argue about it it

08:18.600 --> 08:25.170
is within because of his ramblings we

08:22.950 --> 08:28.830
were up to the Shakti point but shadows

08:25.170 --> 08:30.870
we do not reach not in the East where

08:28.830 --> 08:34.950
people are not that much intelligent

08:30.870 --> 08:38.520
that will educate it and sophisticated I

08:34.950 --> 08:43.650
would say simple people it goes just

08:38.520 --> 08:45.570
there and they just enjoy if you show

08:43.650 --> 08:47.880
them any book written about sahaja yoga

08:45.570 --> 08:49.350
example divorce book those were mother

08:47.880 --> 08:53.280
we don't want it to read we don't

08:49.350 --> 08:54.960
understand this there's a favor now

08:53.280 --> 08:57.290
there what is there now flowing through

08:54.960 --> 08:59.790
our body everything we know it's there

08:57.290 --> 09:02.250
why should we bother about these things

08:59.790 --> 09:04.530
and all the controversies and dogmas and

09:02.250 --> 09:06.690
what are the churches have told you and

09:04.530 --> 09:10.040
why they have failed and why this region

09:06.690 --> 09:10.040
has failed fools bother

09:10.650 --> 09:18.140
so these problems come up because their

09:14.010 --> 09:18.140
attention has been on the spirit of

09:18.860 --> 09:26.400
simple people have that to capacity

09:23.090 --> 09:28.470
so now forgetting everything else all

09:26.400 --> 09:30.900
your intelligence all your books on

09:28.470 --> 09:34.320
education and all that you have had

09:30.900 --> 09:38.880
forget it and just put your attention to

09:34.320 --> 09:42.180
your heart where lies the connection

09:38.880 --> 09:46.620
with God Almighty if your attention is

09:42.180 --> 09:50.460
there you will be surprised that your

09:46.620 --> 09:52.710
attention will be stabilized not only

09:50.460 --> 09:57.900
that it will be stabilized but the

09:52.710 --> 10:02.370
source of joy is that and you will start

09:57.900 --> 10:04.890
feeling that job but if you want to

10:02.370 --> 10:07.050
cooperate and help yourself then you

10:04.890 --> 10:11.400
have to put your attention in such a way

10:07.050 --> 10:15.000
that every problem comes in you go to

10:11.400 --> 10:17.490
your heart not to your brain any

10:15.000 --> 10:20.580
question comes in go to your heart there

10:17.490 --> 10:22.440
resides the blessings of God and you

10:20.580 --> 10:23.910
will be surprised how it will be solved

10:22.440 --> 10:26.370
that's why I said go into thoughtless

10:23.910 --> 10:31.710
awareness that is the quality of heart

10:26.370 --> 10:34.500
because heart doesn't think you go to

10:31.710 --> 10:39.210
your heart means you put your attention

10:34.500 --> 10:43.110
to your spirit you sahaja Yogi's have to

10:39.210 --> 10:48.210
be people of higher outward

10:43.110 --> 10:51.690
manifestation inside you are but outward

10:48.210 --> 10:55.490
manifestation has to be higher you have

10:51.690 --> 10:59.840
to be humble people kind of people

10:55.490 --> 11:03.180
sweeter people loving people

10:59.840 --> 11:08.460
compassionate understanding that you are

11:03.180 --> 11:12.660
there where they are today joyous people

11:08.460 --> 11:14.310
and cheerful people otherwise nobody is

11:12.660 --> 11:16.680
going to believe what is happening in

11:14.310 --> 11:18.240
the Kundalini inside because whatever is

11:16.680 --> 11:22.080
happening is happening you cannot see

11:18.240 --> 11:24.120
that it is important that it should be

11:22.080 --> 11:27.480
evident on you faith in

11:24.120 --> 11:30.860
your behavior in everything for that you

11:27.480 --> 11:34.230
have to understand that you have to

11:30.860 --> 11:36.990
stabilize your attention at the lotus

11:34.230 --> 11:40.410
feet of God this is called saranagati

11:36.990 --> 11:46.670
surrendering by surrendering by

11:40.410 --> 11:50.220
worshiping by bhakti by singing songs by

11:46.670 --> 11:53.160
absolutely settling yourself at the

11:50.220 --> 11:55.290
lotus feet of God already that's the

11:53.160 --> 11:57.630
only way you are going to achieve it

11:55.290 --> 12:01.110
after realization only you have the

11:57.630 --> 12:03.450
entry into the kingdom of God before

12:01.110 --> 12:06.150
that whatever you try has no meaning

12:03.450 --> 12:09.360
Muslims world animal morning till

12:06.150 --> 12:11.580
evening do not get in but we had some

12:09.360 --> 12:13.860

12:13.860 --> 12:18.029
bend I get vibrations every time I say a

12:16.110 --> 12:20.790
last name I get vibration it has

12:18.029 --> 12:27.210
happened with all of them because God

12:20.790 --> 12:30.750
exists he's there it's a fact and the

12:27.210 --> 12:33.540
time has come for all of us to feel him

12:30.750 --> 12:44.970
and know him please put you at the

12:33.540 --> 12:47.070
attention to your heart you cannot feel

12:44.970 --> 12:49.410
heart you cannot know heart chakra

12:47.070 --> 12:51.380
nothing when I say that just say that I

12:49.410 --> 12:54.270
am putting my attention to my spirit

12:51.380 --> 12:56.880
that's all you are saying is a mantra

12:54.270 --> 13:00.089

desire is enlightened and if you just

13:03.180 --> 13:11.510

13:07.380 --> 13:11.510
my heart in the organ of heart

13:17.070 --> 13:25.300

13:25.300 --> 13:30.130
enlightened now there's a light only

13:28.450 --> 13:32.500
thing is if your attention is not

13:32.500 --> 13:40.660
dim if in the dim light to see half

13:35.410 --> 13:42.730
things but you do see but if it is a

13:40.660 --> 13:45.459
bright light you can see it very clearly

13:42.730 --> 13:49.170
so to brighten up the light we just say

13:45.459 --> 13:54.490
that let me be in my heart

13:49.170 --> 13:56.079
