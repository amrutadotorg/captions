00:08:18,784 --> 00:08:23,367
1987-0516 Shri Ganesha Puja, Auckland (New Zealand)

3
00:08:23,923 --> 00:08:31,447
I think it was, very nice that I could come to New Zealand.

4
00:08:34,018 --> 00:08:37,892
You should not feel depressed or unhappy,

5
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:42,003
that the program started with a big bang and then it subsided

6
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:46,378
then its coming up and all that. This is a common thing.

7
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:50,687
Because it is a living process. In every living process,

8
00:08:50,808 --> 00:08:54,052
the thing starts with a very small thing.

9
00:08:54,172 --> 00:09:02,166
And then it grows, according to the weight, that one can, bear.

10
00:09:02,531 --> 00:09:07,998
You see the little tree, or when it was just a sampling,

11
00:09:08,118 --> 00:09:11,383
it had to fight a lot to come up.

12
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:17,426
And when it came up, then also, it would not bear fruits.

13
00:09:17,546 --> 00:09:21,123
It would only bear two leaves, you see, to open out.

14
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:26,500
Because the stock was not so powerful to hold the whole thing.

15
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,395
So when your Sahaja Yogis will be more, and ready,

16
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:33,262
then you’ll get more people and more people.

17
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:37,012
But one should not expect too much of quantity.

18
00:09:37,132 --> 00:09:39,563
What we need is quality.

19
00:09:39,683 --> 00:09:44,623
If you try for quantity, then there would be a problem.

20
00:09:45,488 --> 00:09:49,250
Because quantity, the quality will go down.

21
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:51,760
So in the beginning, when it is the foundation,

22
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,188
it is very important to have good quality.

23
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:57,295
As you see in a house,

24
00:09:57,415 --> 00:10:01,730
in the foundation we always put, very heavy stones,

25
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,269
which can bear the whole structure.

26
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:07,602
In the same way, in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

27
00:10:07,722 --> 00:10:13,128
we have to put very solid people, to work it out.

28
00:10:13,248 --> 00:10:17,896
Unless and until they are of a very solid nature, they’re thrown out.

29
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:20,914
That’s why Christ has said, first could be the last.

30
00:10:21,034 --> 00:10:23,887
Because so many people come for the first time,

31
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:26,835
and may just get lost. Because they are no good.

32
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:29,304
They have to bear the structure.

33
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:31,929
They cannot be ordinary Sahaja Yogis.

34
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:38,717
Now we have many qualities, to, to make it really,

35
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:46,687
very very strong and also, to make it bearing.

36
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:51,241
First of all, a Sahaja Yogi, which is on in the foundation

37
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:56,444
doesn’t show off. He bears, he holds.

38
00:10:57,285 --> 00:11:02,332
He is the, actually the Adhara as they say, the support.

39
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:05,654
The complete support of Sahaja Yoga in a country.

40
00:11:05,774 --> 00:11:08,412
So the first few, you come to the Sahaja Yoga,

41
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:11,031
are very very important people.

42
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:13,982
And an intensive work has to be done on them.

43
00:11:14,102 --> 00:11:17,395
And they have to work out also intensively.

44
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:18,962
Because the first ones,

45
00:11:19,082 --> 00:11:23,078
if they are weak, the whole thing topples down.

46
00:11:23,355 --> 00:11:27,242
So by some mistake, you see, some weak persons may join you.

47
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:29,336
Then the whole thing will topple down.

48
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:32,734
Again you’ll have to raise it. It’s like another resurrection.

49
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:36,197
Then again you have to see that you don’t have weak people there.

50
00:11:36,317 --> 00:11:38,689
Then you have to build them up in such a manner

51
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:41,919
that they grow properly

52
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:46,529
to the size that can bear the whole structure.

53
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:48,567
Later on, of course, you’ll be surprised,

54
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:52,629
the structure grows very fast. Like in Australia

55
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:57,889
you know we started in a very, very, poor way, to begin with.

56
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,491
And the people who really started are out of Sahaja Yoga.

57
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:04,982
Absolutely out. And the rest of them,

58
00:12:05,102 --> 00:12:09,017
out of them also, those who were really solid people,

59
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:14,266
could form the foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

60
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:18,839
So, one has to be careful, as to understand,

61
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,103
that what we need now is quality, not the quantity.

62
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:25,985
If you have too many people around your heads,

63
00:12:26,105 --> 00:12:28,329
you won’t be able to manage them at all.

64
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:31,633
But if you have few good people you should be thankful.

65
00:12:31,753 --> 00:12:35,993
That’s why, if, there is no publicity that has come,

66
00:12:36,113 --> 00:12:40,763
or there are small number of people, you should be very satisfied.

67
00:12:40,883 --> 00:12:42,679
Not to feel sad about it,

68
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,340
that see now, Sahaja Yoga is not spreading.

69
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,341
It’s not the spreading that is important now.

70
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:54,702
Is the deeper, embeddiment, that is important.

71
00:12:54,822 --> 00:12:58,584
And for that we need really solid people for Sahaja Yoga.

72
00:12:58,704 --> 00:13:02,237
So, you are the first, few people here,

73
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:04,920
who are going to form the foundation,

74
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,728
of New Zealand’s Sahaja Yoga.

75
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:11,654
Maybe one day it might be a very very big structure.

76
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:15,425
Doesn’t matter. Maybe your, you might be, taking a role

77
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:18,921
of a foundation, which doesn’t show off.

78
00:13:19,501 --> 00:13:23,412
But your names will be written in golden letters,

79
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,645
that such people started Sahaja Yoga.

80
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:29,252
Because it’s a big struggle in the beginning to

81
00:13:29,372 --> 00:13:31,364
implement Sahaja Yoga.

82
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:37,425
Now I have seen that people, who are false spread very fast.

83
00:13:37,545 --> 00:13:40,349
Very fast. You’ll hear their names everywhere,

84
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:42,509
suddenly you see it’s all going everywhere.

85
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:45,752
And you’ll be surprised that they are in the market already.

86
00:13:45,872 --> 00:13:49,526
The reason is, that, is not a living process.

87
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,948
Is just Plastics.

88
00:13:52,068 --> 00:13:57,040
Plastic flower you can produce, in 1 day, thousands.

89
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,830
But to produce 1 flower, on a tree,

90
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,073
first flower is so difficult.

91
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:07,887
Then few flowers, then the blossom time comes.

92
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:11,485
Is not, that suddenly you get many flowers.

93
00:14:11,605 --> 00:14:15,274
So one has to understand that, in the beginning of anything,

94
00:14:15,394 --> 00:14:18,757
there are difficulties, and there are problems.

95
00:14:18,877 --> 00:14:20,407
Funny people will come in,

96
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,757
they start doubting, they’ll go out.

97
00:14:22,877 --> 00:14:25,581
Then some more will come, they will get into it,

98
00:14:25,701 --> 00:14:27,955
they will do this, and they’ll get out.

99
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,229
So there are two forces always working in Sahaja Yoga:

100
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:34,511
one is the centripetal, another is centrifugal.

101
00:14:34,631 --> 00:14:37,809
By one force, people are attracted towards to Sahaja Yoga,

102
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:39,563
because they know it’s the truth.

103
00:14:39,683 --> 00:14:42,182
And this is the end of their seeking.

104
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:45,579
And this, they have to have. Because they, find out

105
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:49,677
through their pure intelligence that this is the way.

106
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:52,204
Now there are people who just try to test,

107
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,621
like guru shopping you see. So they think:

108
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:58,134
“let us go this shop is, they don’t charge you anything.

109
00:14:58,254 --> 00:14:59,257
Let’s get in here”.

110
00:14:59,377 --> 00:15:02,936
but they are the people, who just do not stick-on sometime.

111
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:06,257
Or they have too many problems, from other gurus maybe.

112
00:15:06,377 --> 00:15:08,372
Or maybe they may stick-on.

113
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:12,050
And some of them who stick-on, stick-on very well.

114
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,363
So, we cannot say, what immediately will happen,

115
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:19,548
in a living process you can’t say this tree,

116
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,853
which side it will take?

117
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:23,411
Whether it will go straight or on the sides

118
00:15:23,531 --> 00:15:25,153
or it will move the other way.

119
00:15:25,273 --> 00:15:27,431
So, it is, you cannot say that way.

120
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:33,190
But we can say one thing, that, at least from my experience,

121
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:36,895
I feel that in the beginning, whatever starts in a small way,

122
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:40,667
in a struggling way, really is embedding itself nicely,

123
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:42,580
into the Mother Earth.

124
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,266
And is a very good sign.

125
00:15:44,386 --> 00:15:47,842
Because that’s the way, it always works out better.

126
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:50,861
Whatever is frivolous, or whatever is cheapish,

127
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:55,983
or which spreads out without much difficulties, is of no use.

128
00:15:56,103 --> 00:16:00,188
It’s like grass. Anybody can take it away.

129
00:16:00,308 --> 00:16:03,302
So the embeddiment and all that, has to go inside.

130
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:06,052
As you are shaking it nicely to go inside.

131
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:09,492
And that’s what it is. Where, you should be very happy,

132
00:16:09,612 --> 00:16:11,207
that it is working out that way.

133
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:17,459
Somebody has come? Let him come. Come along.

134
00:16:24,864 --> 00:16:31,776
So the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, may look to be little shaky.

135
00:16:31,896 --> 00:16:35,277
May look to be little feeble. But it is not.

136
00:16:35,397 --> 00:16:38,529
It is getting stronger and stronger.

137
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:42,580
And it is getting embedded into the Mother Earth.

138
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,706
And, that is what, is the test of you being the real seekers.

139
00:16:47,826 --> 00:16:51,400
You being the people who want truth.

140
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,458
Who do not want a big show, big,

141
00:16:55,578 --> 00:16:59,161
sort of a, community sitting there,

142
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:04,771
all going mad with some sort of a shouting, screaming and nonsense.

143
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:08,681
As it is you know, Sahaja Yoga, is a living process.

144
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:12,080
And, it goes both, grows both, both ways.

145
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,631
Upwards and downwards.

146
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:17,301
In the beginning it grows more downwards,

147
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:20,453
and in the downwards process, we have to depend,

148
00:17:20,587 --> 00:17:24,705
on our vibrations very much. We must all the time remember,

149
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:29,376
that we are realized souls. That we have got vibrations.

150
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:31,524
This is the way we have to judge.

151
00:17:31,644 --> 00:17:33,794
This is the way we have to understand.

152
00:17:33,914 --> 00:17:38,291
The vibration is the only way, that we’ll know others.

153
00:17:38,411 --> 00:17:42,358
Not by something, something you will feel

154
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,422
that the person looks very sweet and nice and,

155
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:47,768
may a snake come out of that person.

156
00:17:47,888 --> 00:17:51,671
So best is, to judge a person, through vibrations.

157
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,953
Judge everything through vibrations.

158
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,620
Not through your own understanding,

159
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,584
or superficial methods of judging others.

160
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,786
Now, there are also so many conditionings we have got,

161
00:18:03,906 --> 00:18:08,463
by which we judge others. And these conditionings, can also,

162
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:13,347
bias our judgment. So best way is to see the vibrations.

163
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,428
Through vibrations, you will have the real knowledge

164
00:18:16,548 --> 00:18:18,388
about what is happening.

165
00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:22,864
Now many people, in the beginning, also start misguiding.

166
00:18:22,984 --> 00:18:25,938
So best is to develop your vibrations.

167
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:28,550
For that you have to grow inward first of all.

168
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:33,345
If you grow inward, deeply, then what will happen,

169
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:38,878
that outward growth will be very solid, and would be exact.

170
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:41,059
You won’t have any problems with that.

171
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:42,932
But if you do not grow inward,

172
00:18:43,052 --> 00:18:45,998
if you do not meditate and pay attention to it,

173
00:18:46,118 --> 00:18:51,423
and, I would say, it is more the dedication that you have,

174
00:18:51,543 --> 00:18:56,334
that works out so well that you grow upwards so well.

175
00:18:56,454 --> 00:18:59,914
I mean you can give a speech whenever you want about Sahaja Yoga,

176
00:19:00,034 --> 00:19:02,700
you can give realization to people whenever you want,

177
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,036
you can cure people whenever you want.

178
00:19:05,156 --> 00:19:07,561
But first, there should be a depth in you.

179
00:19:07,681 --> 00:19:09,365
If that you have not achieved,

180
00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:11,920
you just start superficially doing something.

181
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,556
Then maybe you are hit, or maybe you are in trouble,

182
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:20,787
or maybe you may start doubting yourself, maybe Sahaja Yoga too.

183
00:19:20,907 --> 00:19:24,994
So the first thing is for us to grow deeply.

184
00:19:25,114 --> 00:19:28,941
And while we are growing deeply, we have to also grow

185
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:34,177
in such a manner that we understand our vibrations clearly.

186
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:38,663
Now see a root, of a little plant,

187
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:43,424
has a got a very small little cell at the base of it.

188
00:19:43,544 --> 00:19:46,577
And the plant, doesn’t know anything,

189
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:49,172
as much as that little cell knows.

190
00:19:49,292 --> 00:19:54,662
Because it is going inside, by its own intelligence,

191
00:19:54,782 --> 00:19:56,305
its own vibrations.

192
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:59,106
Now if it finds a stone, it doesn’t go and quarrel.

193
00:19:59,226 --> 00:20:02,330
So don’t fight with the people who are stonies.

194
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,942
Just don’t argue with them.

195
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:06,895
You cannot make them understand. It’s not possible.

196
00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:10,155
They have to be seekers and soft,

197
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:13,071
like the soft clay you can say,

198
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:19,553
through which this little cell goes, penetrates.

199
00:20:19,673 --> 00:20:23,407
Then it finds, supposing, it finds a big stone.

200
00:20:23,803 --> 00:20:26,015
Then what, it goes round and round and round.

201
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:29,435
So gives it a bandhan nicely! And goes down.

202
00:20:29,555 --> 00:20:32,906
Later on when it becomes a tree, he uses the stone

203
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:36,967
for its, you see, for its support.

204
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:38,134
So in the same way,

205
00:20:38,255 --> 00:20:41,276
you can go round and round and round somebody like that.

206
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:44,188
But, giving just bandhan without saying anything.

207
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:47,462
In your heart. Not saying, arguing with him anything.

208
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:50,485
Because you’ll break your head but he will never be alright.

209
00:20:50,605 --> 00:20:52,777
So best is not to argue with him.

210
00:20:52,897 --> 00:20:54,884
But just give him bandhan in your heart

211
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:58,003
and somehow or another bind it. So that later on,

212
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,478
you see, he will become Sahaja Yogi,

213
00:21:00,598 --> 00:21:02,153
but will be a big support to us.

214
00:21:02,273 --> 00:21:04,861
Because it’s just a stone you see. Just now,

215
00:21:04,981 --> 00:21:08,857
use soft people, people who are easy people,

216
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:14,086
people who are seekers, who are not so complicated.

217
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:17,006
And, you cannot argue it out.

218
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:20,093
Sahaja Yoga cannot be argued out, cannot be explained to.

219
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:23,157
Only thing you have to get it. And if they don’t get it,

220
00:21:23,277 --> 00:21:25,974
you cannot argue it out: “Oh this is this, this is this”.

221
00:21:26,094 --> 00:21:28,466
Like, one reporter was asking me:

222
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:30,887
“why is it I’m not getting realization?”.

223
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:33,466
I couldn’t tell him that he was such an egoist.

224
00:21:33,586 --> 00:21:36,684
I couldn’t tell him that so I said: “maybe this, maybe that”.

225
00:21:36,804 --> 00:21:38,727
you see, I was avoiding the topic!

226
00:21:38,847 --> 00:21:40,628
No use telling him you are a big egoist.

227
00:21:40,748 --> 00:21:43,819
How can you get your realization? Because if I tell him like that,

228
00:21:43,939 --> 00:21:47,676
then he would be, just off! Absolutely. And he would be against

229
00:21:47,796 --> 00:21:49,339
Sahaja Yoga completely.

230
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:53,589
So we have to use also, tactfully, a method by which

231
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:57,649
we do not hurt others. But try to be nice and gentle,

232
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:00,009
so they like at least your outer appearance

233
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:04,911
that they are very gentle people, they
are very good people and all that.

234
00:22:05,165 --> 00:22:08,854
Now, in Sahaja Yoga also there is a temptation you might have.

235
00:22:08,974 --> 00:22:11,427
Because you suddenly get lot of money sometimes,

236
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:13,398
suddenly get a big position.

237
00:22:13,518 --> 00:22:22,444
Suddenly, also you might get a very, rare, dynamic gifts.

238
00:22:22,564 --> 00:22:26,379
Like you can become great artist, you can become a great poet,

239
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:29,761
you might be, something might happen to you suddenly.

240
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:34,204
You get a public speaking gifts or anything like that.

241
00:22:34,324 --> 00:22:37,882
But these are all temptations, and one should not fall into it.

242
00:22:38,002 --> 00:22:40,997
Of course you must use them for Sahaja Yoga, is alright.

243
00:22:41,117 --> 00:22:42,738
But you should not fall into it

244
00:22:42,858 --> 00:22:45,369
and start thinking I’m something great. You see.

245
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:50,270
If that is done, then there is a big problem because,

246
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:56,369
such a thing gets a person completely out of Sahaja Yoga

247
00:22:56,489 --> 00:22:59,143
and he gets also punished, in a way.

248
00:22:59,263 --> 00:23:01,185
Maybe he loses his powers.

249
00:23:01,305 --> 00:23:06,603
So it’s best is, to keep to your Sahaja Yoga meditation.

250
00:23:06,723 --> 00:23:09,103
Keep to your own understanding.

251
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:11,568
Know yourself, that is the best way.

252
00:23:11,688 --> 00:23:16,383
And not to be diverted by all these temptations.

253
00:23:16,503 --> 00:23:19,029
But the same can be used for Sahaja Yoga.

254
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:22,429
If that is used for Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing wrong.

255
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:26,712
Because these gifts are given to you, not to tempt you but,

256
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:29,340
for using for Sahaja Yoga.

257
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,117
For example, she got my photograph with the light on my head.

258
00:23:34,237 --> 00:23:42,000
That means there is something happen, between her and the light.

259
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,462
Because how did I get that light upon my head is a problem.

260
00:23:45,582 --> 00:23:50,022
To be understood, very simply, that the Vishnumaya is the,

261
00:23:50,878 --> 00:23:54,954
is the, Goddess for light. For electricity.

262
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:59,245
And if She wants, She can turn it into any angle

263
00:23:59,365 --> 00:24:03,448
and can put a subtle meaning to her photograph.

264
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:06,072
Now people have taken photographs of the clouds

265
00:24:06,192 --> 00:24:08,501
and they found me there, absolutely there.

266
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:11,187
People believe it or not but it is so.

267
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:13,515
Two photographs they saw like that.

268
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:16,687
And normally we don’t take photographs of the clouds.

269
00:24:16,807 --> 00:24:18,810
But it showed in such a way that,

270
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:25,275
they first saw a very, luminous, cluster of a cloud.

271
00:24:25,395 --> 00:24:29,265
And then it expanded and started looking like a Ganesha.

272
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:31,385
So, their attention was attracted.

273
00:24:31,505 --> 00:24:38,018
Then, strings of lights started flowing from both the sides.

274
00:24:38,138 --> 00:24:40,181
And they found two clusters.

275
00:24:40,301 --> 00:24:42,467
So they took photos of these two clusters

276
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:45,298
and when they developed it, they found my photographs,

277
00:24:45,418 --> 00:24:47,393
two photographs of mine were there.

278
00:24:47,513 --> 00:24:50,974
One was with, even with the nose thing, when I was wearing it,

279
00:24:51,094 --> 00:24:52,360
means very latest ones!

280
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,327
And another one where I look more like a, Red Indian face.

281
00:24:58,447 --> 00:25:01,132
That kind, coming out of the thing. It’s clearly,

282
00:25:01,252 --> 00:25:04,176
very clearly you can see. So that’s how they have taken it.

283
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:08,322
It’s in the Bible, that you will know the Holy Ghost,

284
00:25:08,442 --> 00:25:14,124
with the forms of the clouds. Its written down.

285
00:25:14,244 --> 00:25:16,109
So this is how it is verified.

286
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,835
But how many people are going to believe it? Very few.

287
00:25:18,955 --> 00:25:21,955
Very few people are going to believe that this is natural.

288
00:25:22,075 --> 00:25:25,078
They’ll think “oh, it’s all made up and done up and all that”.

289
00:25:25,198 --> 00:25:29,051
Because even if the nose ring is showing, is too much.

290
00:25:29,171 --> 00:25:31,083
Now this Vishnumaya works that way.

291
00:25:31,203 --> 00:25:34,325
There are so many other Deities who work out something

292
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:36,908
in a different way. But whatever it is,

293
00:25:37,028 --> 00:25:39,705
they are all for your construction.

294
00:25:39,825 --> 00:25:43,908
For your building up as a good Sahaja Yogi.

295
00:25:44,028 --> 00:25:47,882
So the inner movement is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

296
00:25:48,002 --> 00:25:51,386
I’m very happy to know that you people are gathering here,

297
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:54,617
for meditation and you’re listening to my tapes

298
00:25:54,737 --> 00:25:58,036
and are growing up well, and I was very happy to see

299
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:01,832
the way you are growing. And keep your steady growth.

300
00:26:01,952 --> 00:26:04,723
Then you’ll become great Sahaja Yogis.

301
00:26:04,843 --> 00:26:09,885
I’m sure one day, New Zealand or Australia,

302
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:16,450
may become the leader, of all the world to, follow, spirituality.

303
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:20,582
Because, India is, of course, I must say India is spiritually

304
00:26:20,702 --> 00:26:23,735
very developed but, they are not leaders I think.

305
00:26:23,855 --> 00:26:27,565
So far, I have not seen much leaders coming out of India.

306
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:30,424
But, once the leaders start coming out of India,

307
00:26:30,544 --> 00:26:32,952
we can say the, then the second position

308
00:26:33,072 --> 00:26:36,756
should be given to Australia and New Zealand.

309
00:26:36,876 --> 00:26:40,759
There will be great people coming out of Australia and New Zealand.

310
00:26:40,879 --> 00:26:47,848
No doubt about it. Because the, the root part maybe in India.

311
00:26:47,968 --> 00:26:50,748
The foundation part maybe from India,

312
00:26:50,868 --> 00:26:53,926
but the tree part, will be from the west.

313
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,875
And that is how the east and west

314
00:26:55,995 --> 00:26:59,400
is going to complete the tree of Sahaja Yoga,

315
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,229
blossoming and giving fruits.

316
00:27:02,349 --> 00:27:04,182
May God bless you all.
