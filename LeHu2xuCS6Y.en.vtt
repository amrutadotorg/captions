"Enlightened by Mahalakshmi Principle"

00:10.890 --> 00:16.804
1992-0220 Australia (Excerpts)

00:21.218 --> 00:27.832
As you know, the Mahalakshmi principle
lies within all of you, in the center.

00:28.032 --> 00:34.479
And once you are fed up with the falsehood,

00:34.679 --> 00:42.046
and also with the hypocrisy of people,

00:42.644 --> 00:47.271
you start seeking the truth within.

00:47.472 --> 00:54.819
That's how a new category of people are
born, who are called as seekers - sadhakas.

00:55.019 --> 00:58.982
They are very different from others.

00:59.779 --> 01:07.434
They don't care for any material gain

01:08.156 --> 01:16.318
or any power, position.

01:16.519 --> 01:24.764
They want to seek the truth and this
category is the one you are,

01:24.965 --> 01:28.983
and that's why you have come
to Sahaja Yoga.

01:29.889 --> 01:34.272
This comes from your past lives also.

01:34.472 --> 01:37.448
For many people, I think, it's their
past life

01:37.648 --> 01:41.344
which has brought this seeking in them.

01:41.544 --> 01:45.146
Also the affluence through which
you have gone,

01:45.347 --> 01:51.195
you got fed up with it, and you are
seeking the truth.

01:52.346 --> 01:56.229
So now, first of all to understand
Mahalakshmi principle

01:56.430 --> 02:01.407
we must know that we have two other
channels into which we can jump.

02:01.607 --> 02:04.297
One is the left, another is the right.

02:04.497 --> 02:09.625
And it depends on what sort
of a background you had in this life.

02:09.825 --> 02:13.521
Because of your background in last life,
you have come to the right path.

02:13.721 --> 02:20.138
But last life has been covered
by this life.

02:20.338 --> 02:26.153
The surroundings, the country in which
you are born, your friends, parents,

02:26.354 --> 02:33.769
the society in which you lived,
has dominated you in so many ways

02:34.979 --> 02:44.907
that the Mahalakshmi principle doesn't
express itself in that full power

02:45.107 --> 02:48.802
which should really suck in everything else

02:49.003 --> 02:55.010
and put you onto the throne
of a Sahaja Yogi.

02:56.158 --> 03:01.042
Now for a Sahaja Yogi to keep
his Mahalakshmi principle all right -

03:01.242 --> 03:07.334
has to always introspect, not to look
at others but to introspect.

03:07.534 --> 03:16.105
"What am I doing? Am I in the left side
or on the right side?

03:16.306 --> 03:24.042
Which side [am] I moving? What side
I’m following?

03:24.243 --> 03:27.384
Am I in the center?"

03:29.240 --> 03:31.355
Now how will you judge?

03:31.556 --> 03:37.980
The best is to feel your vibrations,
feel your vibrations.

03:38.181 --> 03:43.949
But sometimes you go so far to the left
or to the right,

03:44.150 --> 03:51.062
that you just do not feel vibrations.
Your Mahalakshmi principle is not working.

03:51.275 --> 03:56.808
Then you go on. It's like a complete
derailment, I should say,

03:57.009 --> 04:02.328
a kind of a slope on which you just
go on falling on to that.

04:03.462 --> 04:07.043
So all these conditionings we should
watch out,

04:07.244 --> 04:10.665
in ourselves and in others - how we
have got

04:10.866 --> 04:14.839
these problems that we slip out
from the central path.

04:15.040 --> 04:19.371
Imagine a train is going on a proper
railway track,

04:19.572 --> 04:23.184
and suddenly it starts moving this way
or that way.

04:23.384 --> 04:30.417
So, where will it end up? Into destruction
going. But you have a way of arranging

04:30.618 --> 04:37.071
that this derailment can be brought back
to the middle path.

04:37.271 --> 04:43.017
So in a very detached way if you look
at yourself like a witness,

04:43.217 --> 04:46.382
and see for yourself, not about others...
even when I give lectures

04:46.582 --> 04:48.434
people start saying, "Oh Mother is saying
about somebody else."

04:48.634 --> 04:53.541
No, I’m saying about you, yourself.
So you watch out that,

04:53.750 --> 05:00.916
"Are you in the center or are you going
to the left or to the right."

05:01.323 --> 05:07.650
First of all, those who are in the center
should not have any physical problems.

05:07.835 --> 05:12.983
Should be able to completely cure
themselves.

05:13.183 --> 05:17.574
If not others, they should be able
to cure themselves.

05:17.775 --> 05:26.972
Secondly, a person who is in the center
is a very peaceful person.

05:27.173 --> 05:31.215
He is never angry. He might put up
a show that you are angry.

05:31.415 --> 05:37.276
But he doesn't get involved into anger
or any emotions whatsoever.

05:37.476 --> 05:47.503
He just watches and he can act. He can
act to be in that feeling of temper,

05:47.704 --> 05:53.371
also lust, greed, anything - but just
to act.

05:53.572 --> 05:58.400
Because sometimes this acting is needed
so he can use it.

05:58.600 --> 06:02.574
But you should be sure, first of all,
that you are completely detached.

06:02.775 --> 06:07.642
So first of all, before acting, you must
become a master of acting.

06:07.842 --> 06:14.699
And for that you have to become your Self.
If you become your Self,

06:14.900 --> 06:22.611
then you are a master and you can see
where are you going.

06:23.189 --> 06:31.095
Now the difference between a Sahaja Yogi
and a Sahaja Yogi who is like this,

06:31.296 --> 06:36.966
as you say, is this, that he is capable
of going to the left or to the right.

06:37.166 --> 06:40.731
They are not solidly Sahaja Yogis,

06:41.359 --> 06:44.468
and they go on like this and there’s
no progress. Imagine

06:44.646 --> 06:47.965
any airplane which is wobbling like that:
will be on the ground only.

06:48.165 --> 06:54.794
Nobody will be able to put it up
in the air,

06:54.994 --> 06:59.305
because God knows what time -
when will it fall down.

06:59.505 --> 07:03.335
So for any machinery, we have to fix it up
properly first,

07:03.535 --> 07:09.186
before we start working it out.
Is to fix up our

07:10.750 --> 07:15.373
Mahalakshmi principle, you have to see
that your physical being

07:15.573 --> 07:18.739
is all right, is normal, no problem.

07:18.940 --> 07:22.801
I’m not meaning the modern ways
of looking at health,

07:23.001 --> 07:26.152
but that you should feel healthy and happy.

07:26.352 --> 07:30.732
You should feel that there’s no problem
with your physical being.

07:30.932 --> 07:35.065
But if you are a complaining type (like)
“I’m here paining, I’m paining there”,

07:35.265 --> 07:38.449
then there’s something wrong with you.

07:40.775 --> 07:47.117
This is the first criteria that you are
in the center.

07:48.222 --> 07:54.280
Then your attention should be more
towards nature -

07:54.480 --> 07:59.840
how the nature is, how it is blossoming,
how it is working out.

08:00.040 --> 08:03.440
It should be towards the sky, stars
and things.

08:03.641 --> 08:08.631
Just to enjoy all the creation that is
around, just to enjoy it.

08:08.832 --> 08:15.636
That’s an enjoyment which is really
so surprisingly deep.

08:15.836 --> 08:19.349
When you see something, beautiful scene
or something,

08:19.549 --> 08:25.416
you go to a very beautiful place, then
a kind of a joy that pours in you

08:25.616 --> 08:29.985
from your Sahastrara, that also you
must experience.

08:30.185 --> 08:33.482
Also you must experience your thoughtless
awareness,

08:33.683 --> 08:38.798
that is when you look at something beautiful
you should suddenly become thoughtless.

08:38.999 --> 08:44.413
Just start seeing it. The whole joy
will start pouring on you.

08:45.166 --> 08:52.149
All of you can know yourself very well
because now you are quite sensitive

08:52.327 --> 08:56.775
and you have your own centers
enlightened by Mahalakshmi principle.

08:56.975 --> 09:03.345
The Kundalini has definitely enlightened
your Mahalakshmi principle.

09:03.545 --> 09:07.059
So you can always make out where are [we],
what my chakras are,

09:07.259 --> 09:13.026
how are they catching, where are they
catching. Instead of avoiding that,

09:13.226 --> 09:18.098
you just work it out - what's the problem,
where is the problem?

09:18.298 --> 09:23.254
Once you work it out then you’ll be
surprised that,

09:23.455 --> 09:28.746
as soon as your desire goes inward,

09:28.946 --> 09:35.086
the Kundalini itself will rush through
and She will cleanse your chakras.

09:35.286 --> 09:38.528
As I was telling you, we do not know
our powers.

09:38.728 --> 09:43.869
Only one thing you have to do is
to desire. You have to desire that,

09:44.070 --> 09:48.769
“Let my vibrations be all right,
let my chakras be cleared out,

09:48.970 --> 09:53.892
let me be in the center, in the balance”.
Just you have to desire.

09:54.095 --> 09:59.660
I mean, it’s such a simple thing to desire.
But that also we cannot do.

09:59.861 --> 10:03.972
Our desires are something else.
Not what we have to be.

10:04.172 --> 10:10.530
Just you have to desire that: “Let me be
a clean Sahaja Yogi.

10:10.730 --> 10:13.127
Let me be a solid Sahaja Yogi”.

10:13.296 --> 10:15.957
There are mediocres who can never be.

10:16.158 --> 10:19.384
I’m not talking about them.
But so many can be

10:19.585 --> 10:25.112
very high up, can be very high up
in Sahaja Yoga.

10:25.312 --> 10:30.228
But their desires are not yet being
fully manifested.

10:30.428 --> 10:37.457
Then there’s a damping effect of so many
things I have told you about.

10:37.658 --> 10:40.582
So supposing you have to catch the plane,

10:40.783 --> 10:44.777
then you don't get down on the way
somewhere and stay out.

10:44.978 --> 10:48.222
In the same way, when your Kundalini
has to rise,

10:48.423 --> 10:50.752
you can see everything that’s happening.

10:50.953 --> 10:54.361
But keep yourself aloof, because you
have to reach your point

10:54.562 --> 10:57.362
and that is through this Mahalakshmi
principle.

10:57.567 --> 10:59.824
It nourishes our brain, our intellect,

11:00.024 --> 11:03.890
everything it nourishes this Mahalakshmi
principle,

11:04.091 --> 11:09.569
above all it is the balancing.
It balances you.

11:09.770 --> 11:17.257
If you are overdoing something,
then it gives you a kind of a push.

11:17.458 --> 11:24.557
If you are not doing anything, again it
works in such a manner that it balances you.

11:25.183 --> 11:29.643
So this is the guiding factor for you,
this Mahalakshmi principle,

11:29.852 --> 11:34.485
which works out everything, you can say,

11:34.685 --> 11:41.340
that is balancing, the equilibrium
and the wisdom.

11:41.540 --> 11:49.027
As the light of Mahalakshmi principle
starts, the wisdom dawns upon you.

11:49.227 --> 11:54.624
But the greatest of all is the love.
Love for God,

11:54.825 --> 12:01.723
love for truth and you thrive on that love.
Just you are there.

12:02.437 --> 12:05.616
So this Mahalakshmi principle is to be
preserved

12:05.816 --> 12:10.176
and has to be always watched
and looked into.

12:10.376 --> 12:14.078
And the blessings of Mahalakshmi
are so many

12:14.263 --> 12:16.583
that, I tell you, I cannot even tell them

12:16.783 --> 12:19.276
in one lecture. I'll have to give
at least ten lectures.

12:19.476 --> 12:24.964
But you yourself know what are the blessings
of this Mahalakshmi principle is.

12:25.164 --> 12:29.405
The greatest is the complete
self-contentedness,

12:29.606 --> 12:32.935
is absolutely self-contented.

12:33.135 --> 12:39.688
You don't want to grab something,
you don't want to run after something,

12:39.888 --> 12:43.912
you are just self contented. You don't
want any publicity,

12:44.112 --> 12:51.893
you don't want any comfort, nothing.
You are comfortable in your Spirit.

12:52.093 --> 12:57.790
This is the greatest blessing of this
Mahalakshmi principle.

12:57.991 --> 13:04.237
And if that is so, then why not we look
after our Mahalakshmi principle

13:04.395 --> 13:07.711
and forget about the rest.

13:07.911 --> 13:11.900
Last of all, when it enters into your
brain,

13:12.101 --> 13:21.296
then the Virata is manifesting and you
become collective, absolutely collective.

13:22.258 --> 13:25.117
It’s such a beautiful thing is to be
collective.

13:25.318 --> 13:27.963
There was a girl who went to Sicily

13:28.163 --> 13:31.344
and she was in a restaurant eating
something alone.

13:31.544 --> 13:36.720
And then she looked at somebody else
and that girl also looked at her.

13:36.921 --> 13:42.431
And this one got up and came to her and
she said... they were not wearing badges.

13:42.632 --> 13:49.242
They said, 'Have you been to Shri Mataji -
Yes, Have you been - Yes.'

13:49.443 --> 13:54.731
'We are Sahaja Yogis - Yes.' And then they
just embraced each other with such joy.

13:54.931 --> 14:00.423
In a far-fetched place somewhere in
Sicily, in some restaurant, imagine!

14:00.632 --> 14:06.587
They just got lost. The feeling of fondness,
the brotherhood, the friendship

14:06.788 --> 14:12.409
is so great and so joyous. You don't then
consider from what country you are,

14:12.609 --> 14:15.431
from where do you come, what is the color
of your skin,

14:15.632 --> 14:19.603
or what is the religion you had followed,
what your parents are.

14:19.804 --> 14:25.548
You just enjoy meeting people.

14:25.749 --> 14:31.914
This friendship, this joy comes from
the same Mahalakshmi principle,

14:32.114 --> 14:36.653
when She enlightens your Sahastrara.

14:36.853 --> 14:41.175
In the Sahastrara you get this feeling
of the whole

14:41.375 --> 14:44.838
and the feeling of the whole is something
so great.

14:45.038 --> 14:48.850
Individualism, people talk, but it is
against the principle of whole.

14:49.050 --> 14:53.278
Who do not know the whole, you see,
talk of individualism.

14:53.478 --> 14:59.142
This individualism which has worked
all kinds of dangers for us - now,

14:59.342 --> 15:02.882
we have to know that we are one
with the whole.

15:03.052 --> 15:10.600
Of course, we are individuals in the sense
that we have different, different faces,

15:10.800 --> 15:14.700
different clothes, different living,
different relationships,

15:14.900 --> 15:19.394
but we belong to the whole.

15:20.171 --> 15:25.330
And this Virata’s feeling that we are
part and parcel of the whole

15:25.531 --> 15:29.938
gives you complete peace and complete
protection.

15:30.138 --> 15:35.685
You never feel that something can
happen to you – never feel.

15:36.687 --> 15:39.169
Some accident will take place, all right,
will take place,

15:39.370 --> 15:43.147
but nothing will happen to me.
I’m a Sahaja Yogi.

15:43.554 --> 15:48.830
So many people have gained like this,
by allowing themselves

15:49.031 --> 15:54.300
to be completely looked after by this
Mahalakshmi principle.

15:54.500 --> 15:59.568
Just surrender to the Mahalakshmi principle
means that you give up your ego

15:59.768 --> 16:03.786
and you give up your conditionings.
You give up both the things.

16:03.986 --> 16:06.432
Just surrendering to your Mahalakshmi
principle.

16:06.632 --> 16:10.768
That's why Mahalakshmi is so important.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.753
May God bless you all.
