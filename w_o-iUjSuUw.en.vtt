00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.570
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.155
As I told you yesterday,

00:05:27.313 --> 00:05:31.180
that truth is what it is.

00:05:31.381 --> 00:05:37.592
We cannot understand it,

00:05:37.957 --> 00:05:40.420
you have to feel it.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.960
We cannot conceptualize it,

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.630
and you cannot feel it also

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.282
at this human awareness.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.020
We have to become a subtler being,

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.700
as described in all the Scriptures,

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.880
that you are to be born again

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.800
and that you have to become the Spirit,

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:14.635
to feel the existence of Truth.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:23.949
First thing, we have to understand,

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.401
that all this is a process

00:06:27.601 --> 00:06:30.609
of a living energy.

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.300
Divine is a living energy,

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:41.330
and divinity within you also is a living energy.

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:48.000
We do not understand sometimes what is a living energy.

00:06:49.195 --> 00:06:53.535
When we sow a seed in the ground,

00:06:53.735 --> 00:06:57.049
they sprout by themselves.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.490
When a mother conceives the child,

00:07:01.691 --> 00:07:06.307
according to the normal nature of human beings,

00:07:06.508 --> 00:07:12.064
their body has to expel everything that is foreign.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.875
But when the child is conceived,

00:07:15.075 --> 00:07:19.209
it is not only kept in the body

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.000
but is nourished, looked after, developed,

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.130
and at the right time it is expelled.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.290
There are so many other things which cannot be explained

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.330
through medical science.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:43.193
But one must know that to understand what I am saying,

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.774
you must have an open mind,

00:07:46.974 --> 00:07:49.521
like a scientist has.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.891
And if you find what I am saying,

00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:56.639
which is like a hypothesis,

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:02.120
is true and gives you the experience of the truth,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.482
then as honest people you must accept it,

00:08:05.705 --> 00:08:10.050
because it is for your emancipation

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:14.077
and for the emancipation of the whole world.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:19.516
In our evolutionary process now we have become human beings,

00:08:19.717 --> 00:08:23.530
but as you know we have not achieved the absoluteness.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.970
For that something has to happen within us:

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.990
the last breakthrough has to take place,

00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:38.394
and that is what we are talking about here.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.930
You have been already told about the mechanism that is here.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.919
And this mechanism exists within you,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.069
these two lines that you see, left and right,

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:57.810
are nourishing our left and right sympathetic nervous system.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.560
And the central one that you see here

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:06.683
is nourishing our parasympathetic nervous system.

00:09:07.802 --> 00:09:13.639
Now these centers are

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.476
created by these two sides,

00:09:17.714 --> 00:09:21.164
left and the right like this in the center,

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.500
and these centers

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.289
are all the time exhausted by us

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.380
whenever we try to use energy.

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.920
For example, if you are running fast

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.086
you can increase the heart rate,

00:09:40.287 --> 00:09:43.210
but it comes to its normal self

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.120
through the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:50.546
while in emergency you use your sympathetic nervous system.

00:09:51.252 --> 00:09:56.689
Thus, we start exhausting the energy of these centers,

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.309
and that’s how we get into problems

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:05.525
of our physical, mental and emotional being.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.795
Supposing we are exhausting the energy on the right-hand side

00:10:09.996 --> 00:10:11.400
means you are very futuristic,

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.400
you are planning all the time, thinking of the future

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.700
then what happens, the right side starts moving like this.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:21.969
And something happens on the left side, a shock, then it breaks.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.960
When it breaks, then we lose our connection

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.300
with the central nervous system;

00:10:28.594 --> 00:10:31.557
that means we lose our connection with our brain that controls it

00:10:31.758 --> 00:10:33.520
and we become on our own.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.729
And that’s how psychosomatic troubles start, specially cancer,

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.290
and the malignancy sets in.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.139
When the Kundalini rises from there,

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.009
She goes through this center as well as this center,

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.490
pushes them together and nourishes them.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.439
Now let us see

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.449
what is the quality of all these centers within us.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.300
This is all within us, and we have to see

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:06.409
that how we exist with the energy of these centers.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:11.480
The first center that you see is down below.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.035
This center which is down below,

00:11:15.235 --> 00:11:17.569
is below the Kundalini,

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:21.979
and so we have to understand that

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:27.100
this center supports the rising of the Kundalini,

00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:30.570
but it's not pierced through by the Kundalini.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.600
This center is

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.822
for all our excretion,

00:11:38.023 --> 00:11:39.700
even sex.

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:42.680
So those people who say that through sex

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.570
you can raise your Kundalini,

00:11:44.771 --> 00:11:48.519
they are absolutely wrong and are misleading you.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.239
Because you can see here clearly, it is below that.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.700
This is the center of innocence,

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:57.916
is the center

00:11:58.116 --> 00:12:00.999
where we say that the deity of innocence is sitting here,

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.240
who incarnated later on as Christ

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.380
on the higher center there

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.960
between, where you see this [lying], my red spot,

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.417
is one of the windows.

00:12:12.618 --> 00:12:15.703
It is on the optic chiasma.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.319
And that’s how we say that

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:23.636
Christ was the incarnation of innocence.

00:12:23.837 --> 00:12:27.995
Because He is sitting on the optic chiasma,

00:12:28.196 --> 00:12:30.566
He said that,

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:37.272
“Thou shall not have adulterous eyes”.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:41.280
This is the sentence He has used.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.340
To such a subtle way He has suggested

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.900
that you will not have adulterous eyes,

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.641
meaning you will have very pure eyes,

00:12:51.842 --> 00:12:53.799
innocent eyes.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.850
Why did He talk of the eyes?

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:59.480
Because He’s sitting on the optic chiasma.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.820
It’s a very constricted center,

00:13:03.043 --> 00:13:05.799
and He was to be resurrected

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.279
to show that you can also pass through

00:13:09.479 --> 00:13:11.299
that center very easily.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:16.000
So His message is not His crucifixion, but His resurrection.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.170
And that is how we are all going to resurrected,

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:22.060
not after death, but right now.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.991
We should not postpone our resurrection any more.

00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:32.020
Then this second center that we have, is very important,

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.320
which is called as the Swadisthana.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.425
This center looks after physical

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.552
and our mental activities.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.930
Perhaps the doctors don’t know

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:49.106
that it has a very important work to do,

00:13:49.307 --> 00:13:54.809
is that it has to nourish the brain

00:13:55.031 --> 00:13:59.229
with new cells,

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.479
because all the time the brain is using

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.780
these cells for its activity.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:09.380
So the energy has to go from this center,

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.869
up there you can see

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.739
and then it nourishes the center,

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.596
it nourishes the brain

00:14:19.796 --> 00:14:21.929
through its activity.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.049
Now when we are very futuristic

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.833
or we are using too much of our brain, I should say,

00:14:27.034 --> 00:14:28.940
too much of our brain activity we have,

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.544
we are futuristic, we are planning too much,

00:14:31.745 --> 00:14:35.540
thinking too much, all the time thoughts and thoughts and thoughts,

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:40.970
that time we are using the energy of this center.

00:14:41.453 --> 00:14:45.980
But this center has another very important thing to be done,

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.000
that it goes round, as you see,

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.940
it moves all round here

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.580
is shown here directly but it’s connected to the center

00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.140
and it moves round and round and round,

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.280
and gives energy to this area

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.200
where we have our liver, our pancreas,

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:09.380
our spleen, kidney, and parts of intestines.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:14.449
Now if you start exhausting ourselves with too much thinking,

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:18.250
then the main work of this center suffers

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:22.400
and that’s how we develop all these diseases of all these organs:

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:26.309
like for example, with liver you develop a liver problem.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:30.290
Liver problem means that liver has a function

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:35.489
to emit heat from your body, which is poison,

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:38.380
into the bloodstream.

00:15:38.581 --> 00:15:43.290
But when liver gets upset, we should say,

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:46.289
the heat is retained in the liver.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:48.877
It passes upward and downward.

00:15:49.078 --> 00:15:51.249
When it passes upward it affects

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:54.891
a center there, as you can see, which we call as the right heart,

00:15:55.092 --> 00:15:58.479
and people develop what we call the disease as asthma.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.000
And when it passes downwards

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.189
it reaches the kidneys and coagulates

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:04.849
and you get kidney troubles,

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:10.501
for which we have to go on dialysis and ultimately to die.

00:16:10.702 --> 00:16:16.788
So this heat is created because our liver is out of gear.

00:16:17.149 --> 00:16:19.759
At the same time this heat can also pass,

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.897
if a person, say, at a very young age drinks

00:16:23.098 --> 00:16:26.297
and puts in too much of physical efforts

00:16:26.497 --> 00:16:29.327
and is all the time busy thinking, thinking,

00:16:29.528 --> 00:16:32.880
he might get a very fatal heart attack,

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.610
because this heat can go towards his heart

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.259
and just collapse it.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.280
Also those people work very hard like that

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.893
can get a very massive heart attack.

00:16:43.094 --> 00:16:46.309
But the people who have other problems,

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:49.226
on the left-hand side, are different type.

00:16:49.427 --> 00:16:52.713
They are the people who have lethargic organs.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.992
These organs do not work,

00:16:55.192 --> 00:16:56.969
and when they do not work

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.140
then they have all the other problems

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.200
of the left side, as we call it;

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.979
and this also causes another serious problem

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.440
of psychosomatic troubles.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.120
Now the essence of this center

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.427
is that it is creativity.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:18.520
When the Kundalini nourishes this center,

00:17:18.730 --> 00:17:21.720
people become extremely creative.

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:24.600
Now you have seen these artists who are playing here.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.570
They were very simple, ordinary artists,

00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:29.560
but after coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.900
suddenly they have bloomed so much.

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:34.450
The most surprising thing is that people,

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:36.580
say, even from Switzerland

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.770
who do not know a word of Sanskrit,

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:40.825
who do not know a word of Hindi language

00:17:41.026 --> 00:17:44.460
have composed poems, they have put them to tunes,

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.240
and they sing as good as these people can sing.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.139
It's impossible to believe that even the English

00:17:51.339 --> 00:17:54.027
who were so difficult to even pronounce

00:17:54.228 --> 00:17:56.740
one sentence in Hindi language,

00:17:56.941 --> 00:18:00.940
are now fluently speaking Sanskrit and talking all these things;

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.966
because of this creativity improves you.

00:18:05.189 --> 00:18:08.330
We have so many artists in India who came to Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.440
I don’t know if you know their names or not

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.730
like Amjad Ali, Jalota, so many of them.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.252
They got their Realization

00:18:15.453 --> 00:18:18.769
and after that, now today they are very well-known artists.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.460
Also the paintings: we have some Australian people,

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:24.920
who became quite good artists,

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.840
after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:32.569
So it gives you a sense of aesthetics,

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:36.720
and also it gives you the energy to express yourself.

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:41.388
Now if you have the technique of how to create anything

00:18:41.589 --> 00:18:44.920
say you want to make a house or you want to paint,

00:18:45.121 --> 00:18:47.555
or if you want to do something,

00:18:47.756 --> 00:18:50.000
mouldings or anything that you want to do

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.120
if you have the technique,

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.920
the creativity, the power of creativity starts pouring in you,

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:58.733
and you start producing things

00:18:58.934 --> 00:19:02.170
on which you cannot even have thought of,

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.340
and these things happen to a person.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.939
So a person can become extremely dynamic with this.

00:19:08.161 --> 00:19:12.570
But if with that you do not keep your Sahaja Yoga practice,

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:16.529
means if you do not keep your connection with the Divine,

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.080
then the energy gets exhausted.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.880
That’s why Self-Realization is very important

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:24.650
for every artist,

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.400
that he should get his connection

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.420
with this All-pervading Power

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:32.160
which is the combination of all the powers,

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:35.060
so that he doesn’t feel exhausted with it.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.535
Not only that, but all the time this source is flowing into him.

00:19:39.789 --> 00:19:43.140
Constantly it has to flow, and that’s why you have to do

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.097
a little practice of Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:45.298 --> 00:19:47.910
after getting your Realization, as I told you yesterday,

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:50.120
that now you don’t stop at this point,

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.380
you have to make the connection perfect.

00:19:52.581 --> 00:19:55.103
Without the connection,

00:19:55.303 --> 00:19:58.159
it may be that you may go down.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.438
So it’s best is to keep your connection on and work it out,

00:20:02.639 --> 00:20:06.840
to give full respect to yourself,

00:20:07.086 --> 00:20:08.739
to your being.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.290
You are not an ordinary thing,

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.750
you are not a chicken or something like that.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:15.369
You are a human being.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.730
And the beauty that is within you is to be discovered,

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.463
is to be nourished

00:20:20.664 --> 00:20:23.080
and to be proud of.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.697
It is such a great thing you have within yourself,

00:20:25.898 --> 00:20:28.849
the powers, which I’ll tell you one by one.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:33.640
Now above that is the, you see the third center.

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.934
which is called as Nabhi, means the navel.

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:41.520
This is the center of

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:46.280
the way we absorb the virtues,

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:50.080
or the virtues are enlightened.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.490
When this center is enlightened

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:54.290
we really become righteous.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:57.360
We don’t have to tell, “Now you don’t do this and don’t do that”.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.964
You just become.

00:20:59.165 --> 00:21:01.409
Like a saint, a real saint,

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.800
will not do wrong things.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.609
In the same way when a person gets his Realization,

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:10.070
by the virtue of this center,

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.620
he becomes absolutely balanced:

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.300
balanced with his family life, with his wife, with his children,

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:21.170
balanced with the politics, economics,

00:21:21.370 --> 00:21:23.200
balanced with the society,

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:26.610
balanced with all the people whom he knows;

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:30.980
in a very balancing way he starts behaving.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:33.519
There’s not one-sided activity.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.163
For example, somebody may be very much attached to the wife

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:39.620
and may try to harm others.

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.727
Somebody who is very much attached to others,

00:21:42.927 --> 00:21:44.241
may harm his wife.

00:21:44.442 --> 00:21:47.660
So a kind of a balance is established by this,

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.370
and a person who gets this

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:54.129
develops a personality which we call as regal.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:57.170
That sense of dignity comes into such a person.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.829
Now you see our children have lost the virtues,

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:03.400
our children don’t have that regalty.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.715
They have become very cheapish also,

00:22:05.915 --> 00:22:08.463
and they run after materialism and things like that;

00:22:08.664 --> 00:22:10.495
they fight for small, small things.

00:22:10.696 --> 00:22:13.560
It’s not only children, even the grown-ups are like that

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.760
and they try to waste their energy,

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.420
fighting for something that is so useless.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.544
So by enlightenment of this center

00:22:21.745 --> 00:22:25.260
you understand the value of matter.

00:22:25.540 --> 00:22:27.840
And the value of matter is this:

00:22:28.041 --> 00:22:30.240
that it has aesthetics, first of all,

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.110
and secondly, you can express your love only through matter.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.240
If you love somebody you’ll give them something,

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.240
a little flower also can express your love.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.200
Anything can express your love through matter,

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.480
and then you become a very generous

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:49.010
and very enjoyable person.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.687
Some people feel

00:22:50.888 --> 00:22:52.919
that if you become generous, you will be bankrupt.

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.061
It’s not so. On the contrary,

00:22:55.262 --> 00:22:58.550
if you open one door, no air will come in,

00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:02.724
but if you open the other door, all the air will start circulating.

00:23:02.925 --> 00:23:06.090
In the same way, when a person is generous

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.671
he starts getting so many blessings -

00:23:08.872 --> 00:23:12.352
because he is also connected with the Divine - that he is amazed.

00:23:12.553 --> 00:23:15.000
He doesn’t know what to do with the things that he has got,

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.050
and then he starts pouring it to others.

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:19.738
There are so many things people are telling Me about,

00:23:19.939 --> 00:23:22.751
miracles and miracles of even material things

00:23:22.951 --> 00:23:26.880
in their jobs, in their purchasing, in their shopping,

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.720
the way they have seen miracles happening

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.010
that it is nothing but just

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.170
that this center is enlightened.

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:39.680
And with this center, within you a righteousness comes in.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.029
And this righteousness doesn’t force anybody else,

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:49.294
it’s just righteousness itself which doesn’t command anything

00:23:49.495 --> 00:23:51.087
or demand anything,

00:23:51.288 --> 00:23:54.285
but it becomes a respectable personality,

00:23:54.486 --> 00:23:57.730
and you just start really understanding

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:59.119
that, “Look at this man”.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.252
Somebody was telling Me today that in the office people asked,

00:24:02.453 --> 00:24:04.720
“How are you so dignified?”

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.740
He said, “I didn’t know I was so dignified.”

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.940
"No, you don’t do anything undignified,

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.440
and you do everything just like a child also".

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.450
So there’s a child-like dignity you develop,

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:19.000
and it’s a beautiful thing to happen, really it’s angelic.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.909
Now then there, we have another center on top,

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:24.139
which we call as the heart center.

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:26.370
It is in the center.

00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:28.739
Now in the sternum bone, behind the sternum bone

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.220
this center is there,

00:24:30.421 --> 00:24:33.993
and thymus produces the antibodies

00:24:34.194 --> 00:24:35.759
in your sternum bone.

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.631
These antibodies, later on, fight your diseases.

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.519
When you are about twelve years of age

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.178
they go into the whole body, and waiting there,

00:24:45.379 --> 00:24:51.286
for a signal from your sternum bone.

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.198
That means supposing you see something, you get frightened,

00:24:54.399 --> 00:24:56.045
this bone starts pulsating.

00:24:56.246 --> 00:24:59.480
When it pulsates, the antibodies know there’s some emergency,

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.719
and they get prepared for it.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:06.188
Now this is such a normal thing to happen to people.

00:25:06.389 --> 00:25:10.050
But the insecurities can be of the worst type,

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.780
and when these insecurities develop,

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:15.780
people can develop all kinds of diseases of the lungs;

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:17.530
specially the women develop

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.980
what you call as the breast cancer.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:21.810
Mostly these women are insecure:

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:24.740
maybe their husbands are not good, or they feel

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.730
that the husband may leave them alone or something like that.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.650
There are certain insecurities that are built in.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.760
They might be quite frightened people, personalities.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.959
I have seen most of the air-hostesses

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.059
have this center heart catching,

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:41.096
because they are afraid they may miss the plane or I don’t know,

00:25:41.297 --> 00:25:43.780
they have to be on the job and run and do.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:46.560
Mostly these time-bound jobs

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.080
cause you a trouble here of the center heart,

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.860
and this center heart is very important,

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.760
because for women specially, they have to be secured.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:59.100
If their motherhood is challenged then they are even worse.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.404
And this is how one has to understand,

00:26:01.605 --> 00:26:03.850
a woman should be very much respected

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:07.350
if she is your wife, she’s your child or anything.

00:26:07.551 --> 00:26:10.770
She has to be respected and given all the security.

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.890
It’s the woman who makes the society,

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.800
it's the woman who creates the children,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.119
it's the woman who looks after the children.

00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.049
So the men have to give all the security and the protection

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:25.400
to the womenhood and understand that is a very important factor,

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:30.080
which if we neglect we can have lots of problems with our society;

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.660
and the women will start competing with men

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:36.180
and then the society will be all dislocated.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.410
So the center on the left side and the right side

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:44.560
are the centers of your father, of your mother and your father.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.890
If there’s any problem with your father,

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:51.120
then the right side catches and it gives you asthma.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.574
First of all you are, we can say,

00:26:53.775 --> 00:26:55.760
vulnerable to asthma, due to bad liver.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.639
Plus if you have problems with your father

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.460
or if with your fatherhood -

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.380
supposing you are an unhappy father,

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.290
or maybe that you are not looking after your children,

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:07.060
then you get this center caught up very badly.

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:09.175
Then on the left side is the mother’s,

00:27:09.376 --> 00:27:12.079
and the mother’s thing is that when some mothers

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.097
are not good mothers; also children can get this.

00:27:15.298 --> 00:27:21.220
Or when the children are not nice to the mother, they also get it.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:25.740
So mother and father are very important factors in Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:27.945
and you have to understand

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:31.016
that if your parents have been unkind to you,

00:27:31.217 --> 00:27:33.495
you must forgive them. Just forget about them.

00:27:33.696 --> 00:27:36.158
Because they have given you birth, you should be thankful,

00:27:36.359 --> 00:27:37.850
and just forget about them.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:42.770
That’s the best way to get over the problem of left and right heart.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.280
Then we have, on top, if you see, is this chakra

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.459
which we call as the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.740
This Vishuddhi chakra is, has got sixteen petals,

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:57.160
and looks after our ear, nose, eyes, throat, everything.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.690
Our face, everything is looked after by this center.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.780
Now this center also has left and right.

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.490
All centers have left and right

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:07.970
and when you feel guilty

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:10.580
the left center catches,

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.396
which is a very dangerous thing

00:28:12.597 --> 00:28:15.370
because this gives you diseases like angina,

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:20.609
or maybe diseases like spondylitis and lethargic organs.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:24.360
Right when a person is very aggressive, talks very aggressively,

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.050
and tries to dominate others,

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:32.155
and use his power of speech to show off,

00:28:32.356 --> 00:28:33.756
the right side catches.

00:28:33.957 --> 00:28:37.740
The reactions of this can be many, that the hands gets frozen,

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:40.900
and they also get the cancer of the throat;

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.760
all kinds of things can happen

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.120
with this chakra being in trouble.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:51.040
Now then we go to the chakra here, in between the optic chiasma.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:54.010
It is placed like this, and it’s absolutely closed.

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:56.065
It is when you forgive.

00:28:56.266 --> 00:28:58.694
Christ has said that you have to forgive.

00:28:58.894 --> 00:29:01.469
When you forgive

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.864
everyone and also when

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.840
you ask for forgiveness,

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.600
this chakra opens like this.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.433
Otherwise it cannot open.

00:29:13.633 --> 00:29:15.812
We saw yesterday that some people,

00:29:16.013 --> 00:29:18.440
at least there were ten, fifteen people

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.410
who never got their Realization, because they had not forgiven.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:24.370
Then when I put My hand, worked on them and it worked.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:26.660
But it’s very simple to forgive,

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.660
because whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.413
you don’t do anything, it’s a myth,

00:29:30.614 --> 00:29:32.768
it’s absolutely a myth that you don’t forgive.

00:29:32.969 --> 00:29:35.930
But for that myth you suffered so much.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.690
So you have to forgive, to open this center of Agnya.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:42.370
It’s very important and is,

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:45.410
the deity on that is Jesus Christ.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.280
Then you enter into the area called limbic area

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.340
which is on top, which is called as Sahasrara in Sanskrit,

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.288
means there are one thousand petals.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.560
These look like

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.420
“tongues of flames” as described in the Bible.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.540
All of them look like “tongues of flames”

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.369
but in the brain they are of seven colors,

00:30:06.570 --> 00:30:11.596
beautifully, very silently, peacefully

00:30:13.217 --> 00:30:15.929
opening, closing, opening, closing.

00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:19.040
So when the Kundalini goes into the limbic area

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.966
it enlightens your brain, it enlightens.

00:30:22.167 --> 00:30:24.490
And as I told yesterday there are many children

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:27.106
who have been dullards, have now

00:30:27.307 --> 00:30:29.917
records in their examination,

00:30:30.118 --> 00:30:32.796
and they have put so much of

00:30:32.996 --> 00:30:35.739
new dimension to their understanding,

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:39.220
that their teachers, their professors are surprised.

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.020
This is what happens when the brain,

00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:45.040
which is used very little, starts getting enlightened.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.809
Automatically you start using it.

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:50.720
Then it pierces through the fontanel bone area,

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.180
which is a very soft bone,

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.709
through which this Kundalini comes out.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:02.699
I told you yesterday that Kundalini is your mother,

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.220
individual mother,

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:08.010
and she is the power of pure desire.

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.360
All other desires that we have are impure.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:16.016
Today we want to have, say, a chair,

00:31:16.216 --> 00:31:19.479
then we want to have a table, then we want to have a house, then...

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.146
We are never satisfied, we go from one to another;

00:31:22.353 --> 00:31:27.449
and it is a principle of economics that

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:30.650
wants are not satiable in general.

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:33.220
So what is that want which is satiable?

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.320
Is this want, this pure desire.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:36.867
And what is the pure desire,

00:31:37.067 --> 00:31:39.579
is to be one with this divine power.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.260
Whether you know it or not,

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:43.169
whether you are aware of it or not,

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:45.460
it exists in all the human beings

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:47.800
and the only thing that has to be done is

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.130
it is to be awakened

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:53.449
and to be connected to this All-pervading Power.

00:31:53.649 --> 00:31:55.303
So the truth is that

00:31:55.503 --> 00:31:59.155
you are not this body, not this mind,

00:31:59.356 --> 00:32:02.319
not these conditionings or ego,

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.579
but you are the pure Spirit.

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:09.570
And the second one, is that with this All-pervading Power,

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:11.680
which is a wonderful thing,

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:15.370
is impossible to describe it in this short lecture of Mine

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:18.479
but it’s the one which organizes,

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.650
which does all the living work.

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.200
To the minutest things it organizes,

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.788
so complicated everything is,

00:32:25.988 --> 00:32:27.646
but it manages all that.

00:32:27.847 --> 00:32:30.182
Not only, but above all,

00:32:30.383 --> 00:32:32.969
it forgives and it loves.

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:35.860
So such a beautiful power is all around us,

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.910
so why should we have any worry?

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:40.940
And now we have to know

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.013
that yesterday we had lots of questions,

00:32:43.214 --> 00:32:44.680
and nice questions were there.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:47.540
Today also I would like you to ask Me questions.

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.118
But in asking questions, please remember

00:32:50.319 --> 00:32:53.197
not to ask “What is Your opinion about this person or that person?”

00:32:53.398 --> 00:32:56.121
Of course, now you must have known that I condemn all the people

00:32:56.322 --> 00:32:59.090
who take money in the name of God; absolutely openly.

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:02.121
So please don’t ask Me questions about such people.

00:33:02.322 --> 00:33:06.600
Moreover, you ask questions which are related to our subject,

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.420
because I have come here

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.210
not to get anything out of you,

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:12.250
but to give you what is your own:

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.400
your beauty, your divinity, your glory.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.941
And then you will be surprised

00:33:18.142 --> 00:33:21.479
that the first thing that happens to you

00:33:21.679 --> 00:33:24.056
is a new awareness, it's a new dimension

00:33:24.256 --> 00:33:26.819
in your awareness comes in

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:30.850
and this awareness is called as collective consciousness,

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:33.570
by which you feel others on your fingertips.

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.060
Who is the other then?

00:33:36.824 --> 00:33:41.409
Also within yourself you can feel what’s wrong with you.

00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:45.150
Only thing, you have to be decoding these signals

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:47.848
and you should know how to correct it.

00:33:48.049 --> 00:33:50.930
This is what has to happen, which is very simple.

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:53.850
Within a month’s time you can become your own masters,

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:58.000
and you know how to treat yourself and how to look after yourself.

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:00.940
I’m sorry I am here in only for today.

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.770
Tomorrow I have to go to Canberra.

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:05.220
And in this lecture,

00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:07.930
whatever was possible in short, I've tried to tell you

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.930
about this great mechanism that is within us.

00:34:11.131 --> 00:34:14.599
But by this you achieve so many beautiful things,

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.303
as I told you yesterday,

00:34:16.504 --> 00:34:19.509
that you achieve the peace,

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.691
you achieve the witness state,

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:24.250
you achieve the collective consciousness,

00:34:24.451 --> 00:34:26.452
you achieve

00:34:26.786 --> 00:34:32.459
the light in your attention, which acts.

00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:37.114
You pay attention to something, it acts, it works.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:40.960
Then you get the power that you can raise the Kundalini of others.

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:45.009
Like one light enlightened can enlighten another light.

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:48.520
Then it gives you a complete idea

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.018
about yourself and about others.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:56.547
Above all, you get an absolute knowledge

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.530
about everything.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:01.956
When you have the absolute knowledge, there’s no quarrel, no war,

00:35:02.157 --> 00:35:06.209
because everybody knows it on their fingertips.

00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:10.520
To know on your central nervous system is the real bodha,

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:12.783
from where the word Buddha has come,

00:35:12.984 --> 00:35:15.699
is the "vida", from where the word Vedas has come.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:19.900
Gnostics, “gn”: “gn” means “jnana”. “Jnana” means the knowledge.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.395
And the knowledge is not mental knowledge,

00:35:22.596 --> 00:35:25.850
but the knowledge on your central nervous system.

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:31.260
Whatever we have achieved in our ascent as human beings,

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.820
we have got all this on our central nervous system.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:40.769
For example, you take a dog or a horse through a dirty place,

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:42.548
he can pass through easily;

00:35:42.749 --> 00:35:44.274
but a human being cannot pass,

00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:47.569
because he has developed a new awareness about it.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:51.279
He knows what is beauty is, he knows what virtues are,

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.509
he knows what is sin is.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.330
For an animal there is no sin, he’ll do whatever he likes,

00:35:56.530 --> 00:36:00.676
because he’s completely under the control of the Divine.

00:36:01.029 --> 00:36:03.479
But for human beings there’s freedom,

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.320
and he has to judge it with trial and error

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.510
and reach a point to understand

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:14.460
that he has to get to a higher awareness.

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:17.467
May God bless you all.

00:36:35.231 --> 00:36:37.625
Thank you.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:52.172
You have to ask the questions. I think they are all forgotten!

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:12.425
Are melanomas and skin-cancers

00:37:12.626 --> 00:37:14.980
caused by a blockage in a chakra?

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:18.123
Yes, all. Of course,

00:37:18.324 --> 00:37:21.025
all our diseases are because of the blockage in the chakras,

00:37:21.226 --> 00:37:22.249
no doubt.

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:25.810
But see now, if you have to treat a tree

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:29.000
and you start putting the medicine on the leaves,

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:31.850
it will never be cured. You have to go to the roots.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.540
And because it is at the roots, it’s so simple.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:38.505
Only there are seven chakras and three nadis

00:37:38.706 --> 00:37:41.647
means about twenty-one permutations and combinations,

00:37:41.848 --> 00:37:44.324
you have to work out, that’s all.

00:37:59.832 --> 00:38:05.428
In meditation, where should we put our consciousness in the body?

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.400
You don’t have to do anything, you just get into it.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:12.480
When the Kundalini crosses over this center,

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.840
immediately you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:17.490
That’s a state when you are in the present,

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:19.980
neither in the future, not in the past.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:24.199
and then the growth, spiritual growth starts working it out.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.219
And suddenly you will find one day

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:31.497
that you have touched that depth of your divinity.

00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:37.140
You don’t have to direct yourself at all.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.740
The Kundalini itself directs.

00:38:55.233 --> 00:38:56.810
Yes?

00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:00.208
Mother, I'd like to know the relationship

00:39:00.409 --> 00:39:03.813
between what is happening in the world in terms of the pollution

00:39:04.014 --> 00:39:07.233
and the damage that's been [unclear] and harms us

00:39:07.434 --> 00:39:10.261
Is there an object, a lesson for mankind in that?

00:39:10.462 --> 00:39:12.765
And I suppose, most, most of us would say "yes",

00:39:12.966 --> 00:39:15.711
but what is the spiritual aspect of what we are doing to our world,

00:39:15.912 --> 00:39:17.244
[what is spiritually to be done]?

00:39:17.445 --> 00:39:21.333
- What's this?
What is the spiritual significance

00:39:21.534 --> 00:39:25.409
on what we are doing to our world in the sense of pollution?

00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:30.208
Yes, spiritual aspect is that we do not have a balance.

00:39:32.490 --> 00:39:35.569
Now once we start a machine,

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:39.129
then machine has to produce, go on producing like mad.

00:39:39.399 --> 00:39:41.279
It produces more and more.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.689
Then the accent is on money, not on Spirit.

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:46.273
So what happens?

00:39:46.474 --> 00:39:48.930
That they produce more and more things

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:53.250
and they create an atmosphere through advertisement, this, that

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:56.739
and everybody starts running for it.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:01.420
Then we have accumulation of so much of rubbish,

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:05.449
and what you have done is that you have exhausted the Mother Earth.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:09.240
But when you get your Realization and when you are spiritual,

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.090
then what happens, you buy very few things,

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:14.089
but very good things.

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:16.938
You don’t run after the fashions or anything,

00:40:17.138 --> 00:40:19.089
but you make a dress

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:22.560
which is good for you, which is decent for you,

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:26.960
and may not be one hundred dresses,

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:29.160
maybe five or six,

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:34.089
but very beautiful, dignified, artistic dresses.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:37.051
In the same way now, supposing

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:40.500
I tell you that “you don’t drink any alcohol,”

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.339
you will all run away. But I don’t say that.

00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.540
After Sahaja Yoga, people just don’t drink.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:48.610
Now your money is saved by that.

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:51.381
But also what is saved in that is

00:40:51.581 --> 00:40:57.300
the amount of paraphernalia you need for a drinking party!

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:05.603
First time, in India I never used to serve any drinks in My house,

00:41:05.804 --> 00:41:08.021
but C.P. said, "In England You have to do it”.

00:41:08.222 --> 00:41:10.015
My husband said,“You have to do it there” .

00:41:10.216 --> 00:41:12.170
I said, “All right, that’s your lookout, not Mine”.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.941
So he got hold of a dictionary, you see,

00:41:15.142 --> 00:41:16.608
a French dictionary, to find out

00:41:16.809 --> 00:41:19.299
what all we have to buy to begin with.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.054
So you’ll be amazed, at that time -

00:41:22.255 --> 00:41:26.982
it was in 1973 we went to London, yes -

00:41:27.183 --> 00:41:28.746
and he said that,

00:41:28.946 --> 00:41:33.398
“At least we’ll have to pay nine hundred pounds,

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:36.210
to get the best quality tumblers”.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:39.229
I said, “Nine hundred pounds for what?” He said,

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:43.219
“For everything you have to have a different type of a tumbler.”

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:46.370
I said, “Really, but for what? What is the need?”

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:49.310
He said, “That’s the custom, that’s the norm”.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:52.040
So you see, also the norms that we have created

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.947
are so stupid. There is no need.

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:58.020
Instead of that in India supposing you are well off, all right,

00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:03.199
they’ll have six tumblers made of silver,

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:07.000
which they’ll pass on from father to son,

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:10.740
son to his son, and that’s all.

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:13.170
You won’t need many things.

00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:17.682
Or plates now; so you’ll have first course, then a second course,

00:42:17.883 --> 00:42:20.759
and a third course, and then you start moving

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:25.060
with all your cutlery this way, then this way, then this way,

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:28.346
and really you don’t know what to do with it.

00:42:28.547 --> 00:42:30.229
So there’s no need to do all that.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.710
There’s no need, you see, to do it.

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:34.599
What is the necessity, you see?

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.217
But you could be simple, you could use your fingers, is the best,

00:42:38.418 --> 00:42:41.318
because after Realization you have vibrations in your hands,

00:42:41.519 --> 00:42:42.769
divine vibrations.

00:42:42.970 --> 00:42:44.631
So you start using your hands,

00:42:44.832 --> 00:42:49.090
and you can use a one nice plate of brass

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:51.800
or of silver, in that same amount.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.280
You see, six plates of silver

00:42:54.480 --> 00:43:01.299
cost you the same as this elaborate, say, a dinner-set

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:06.259
which is always, I would say,

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.800
has to be replaced because it breaks, this happens, that happens.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.480
And the same plates you can pass on to other people.

00:43:13.681 --> 00:43:15.980
There are so many things, we waste our time.

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:20.250
Now if you go to a lady’s apartment,

00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:23.190
you will be surprised that the whole place will be filled

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:26.541
with this Elizabeth Arden, this, that, that, that.

00:43:26.742 --> 00:43:29.649
You open something, it all falls on you.

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:31.873
And then you say, “Why have you got so many?”

00:43:32.074 --> 00:43:33.823
“No, Mother, this is gone out of fashion.”

00:43:34.024 --> 00:43:36.480
“Baba, whatever it was good for your skin,

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.560
whatever was once good for you, use that throughout”.

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.360
“No, but they are changing every time.”

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.200
I said, “But you decide what you want to use it,

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.700
and use that thing all through.

00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:50.160
What’s the use of filling these cupboards with all this?”

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.885
You see, we were in London, we were searching out houses

00:43:54.086 --> 00:43:57.960
and I mean, horrible, I tell you, the experiences were.

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:00.660
You go into any house and suddenly you’ll find

00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:02.880
two legs of the pants falling on, to your [room].

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.664
And then you look up and there’s a pile of things

00:44:05.865 --> 00:44:07.280
kept on the top of the loft.

00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.880
Just the loft is overfilled with all the clothes.

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.879
And so much was filled.

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:16.080
I tell you, Australians are much more neater people,

00:44:16.281 --> 00:44:18.260
but if you go to England you’ll be shocked,

00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.683
because they are the buyers,

00:44:20.884 --> 00:44:23.770
for ages they have been buying, buying, buying, buying,

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:26.200
and there’s no place for human beings to live inside.

00:44:26.401 --> 00:44:28.974
They live outside,

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:32.831
in the Hyde Park!

00:44:33.032 --> 00:44:35.145
They are sitting in the Hyde Park. If you ask them,

00:44:35.346 --> 00:44:39.053
“Why are you here?”, “Our house are overfull”.

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:44.640
So you develop the balance.

00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:47.129
And because of this lack of balance,

00:44:47.329 --> 00:44:50.185
there is ecological problem.

00:44:54.486 --> 00:44:56.123
Is Kundalini to be developed

00:44:56.323 --> 00:45:00.025
within certain age of human existence

00:45:00.226 --> 00:45:04.130
or can it be developed any age?

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.368
Is the Kundalini to be developed

00:45:10.639 --> 00:45:14.175
you know, at a certain age in human existence,

00:45:14.376 --> 00:45:16.300
or can it be developed at any age?

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.159
At any age. There’s nothing like that.

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:23.997
There’s no age, no time, nothing. It’s beyond all that.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:28.340
Even so many children are born realized these days.

00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:31.890
Sahaja Yogis get the children, when they marry,

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:34.330
they get children who are already born realized.

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:37.169
They are so wise, you know, very wise,

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:41.850
and they come and have a conference with Me very special.

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:44.953
And then they tell Me about all the uncle and aunties,

00:45:45.154 --> 00:45:47.960
what’s wrong with their chakras.

00:45:51.089 --> 00:45:53.099
They are My great friends, I should say;

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.001
but very wise, you know.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.130
She was recently told that she should never meditate

00:46:22.331 --> 00:46:24.700
unless she’s had a glass of water.

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:26.934
- Should I? For Me?
- This is neccessary...

00:46:27.135 --> 00:46:30.089
- For Me?
- No, no, anyone meditating.

00:46:30.297 --> 00:46:33.424
- I didn’t understand, what is it?
- Nor did I.

00:46:34.764 --> 00:46:39.200
She said she was recently told that she shouldn’t meditate

00:46:39.401 --> 00:46:42.450
until she’s had a glass of water.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.112
Are you? Sahaja Yogis told you that?

00:46:46.312 --> 00:46:48.449
Yes, [finding how]...

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:52.199
See, sometimes what happens, supposing you are a liver patient,

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.090
then the heat might be generated out of your head, you see,

00:46:56.290 --> 00:46:58.099
like a chimney it opens out.

00:46:58.300 --> 00:46:59.944
So if you take little water,

00:47:00.145 --> 00:47:02.820
the heat won’t feel so much. May be that.

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:05.130
But I get the heat from all the rest of the people,

00:47:05.338 --> 00:47:09.335
and I go on drinking water all the time to cool Myself, too.

00:47:20.027 --> 00:47:23.200
There are so many different forms of meditation.

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.720
Does any sort of meditation work?

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.139
No, no, it does not. We do not meditate,

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.345
we have to be in meditation.

00:47:31.546 --> 00:47:33.849
There’s difference between the two.

00:47:34.050 --> 00:47:36.740
You do not meditate before Realization;

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:40.379
after Realization you are in meditation.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:42.880
So you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.330
So when you meditate in Sahaja Yoga

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:47.850
you become thoughtlessly aware,

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:52.340
and then you start growing into a new awareness

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:53.800
or a higher awareness

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.919
which you call as doubtless awareness,

00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:59.260
and that is how you start growing.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:03.290
So the meditation is that you get into meditation,

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:05.920
you don’t do meditation.

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.779
This one.

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:11.995
If you are one of these people that are thinking all the time

00:48:12.196 --> 00:48:14.228
and you are blocking up the other side,

00:48:14.429 --> 00:48:17.089
how do you balance [that]?

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:21.890
If you are an excessive thinker, if you’re thinking all the time,

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:24.640
and this causes a block on the opposite side,

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.490
how are you balance things out?

00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:33.379
Just by, you see, turning your hand left to the right.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.619
It's very simple.

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:39.320
You won’t believe, but that’s how we manage it.

00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.797
First the vibrations must flow from your hand,

00:48:46.998 --> 00:48:48.600
then you will know how to balance.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.840
But when that doesn’t happen,

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.580
then you can ask somebody to balance you.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:32.449
It’s quite a big question.

00:49:34.112 --> 00:49:41.025
He says, You appear to be forming a hypothesis about Kundalini

00:49:41.226 --> 00:49:45.419
and relating it to medical conditions.

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:48.309
From where does this hypothesis come?

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:51.180
- Hypothesis?
- About Kundalini.

00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:53.849
Is My own knowledge.

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:58.445
I have also done medicine, to relate it to that.

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:02.170
Is My own knowledge, I should say,

00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:04.770
and so many saints had this knowledge too.

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:07.890
But the only thing I have done is I have related

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:11.279
to not only to medical, but also to science.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.040
That’s very important. Apart from that,

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:17.529
I have devised a method, I would say,

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:21.398
of permutations and combinations of human problems.

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:25.050
I’ve studied them and worked it out in such a way

00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:28.400
that en masse Realization can be given.

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:34.400
You see, I always try not to talk about Myself

00:50:34.601 --> 00:50:38.129
because, you see, Christ said that He was the Son of God

00:50:38.330 --> 00:50:42.550
which was the truth, truth, absolute truth,

00:50:42.751 --> 00:50:44.939
but people crucified Him for that.

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:48.060
Because people don’t understand divine things,

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:50.049
they don’t understand, you see;

00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:52.410
they have no idea as to the divine Power,

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:53.893
what it can do.

00:50:54.094 --> 00:50:55.770
So they don’t understand,

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:58.330
so no use telling them about yourself.

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:01.170
As I told you, that I want to live,

00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:04.956
I don’t want to get crucified just now.

00:51:27.958 --> 00:51:29.717
So when you are meditating

00:51:29.918 --> 00:51:31.889
and you feel a force within you blooming,

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:34.759
could You explain what this force is?

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:37.090
- When you are meditating?
- Yes.

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:40.874
Now which meditation she is doing, first of all, let’s know.

00:51:41.074 --> 00:51:44.293
- What kind of meditation are you doing?

00:51:44.642 --> 00:51:46.119
Chanting meditation.

00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:48.200
Chanting?

00:51:48.684 --> 00:51:53.220
Chanting is absolutely wrong. Absolutely wrong.

00:51:53.779 --> 00:51:56.500
Because if you are not connected,

00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:00.729
supposing you are taking the name of God, any way,

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:03.679
and you are not connected,

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.580
then what’s the use of taking the name?

00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:10.919
You are not connected. It’s like telephoning without connection.

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.704
It’s very practical.

00:52:12.905 --> 00:52:16.440
Moreover, say, if you have to meet,

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.050
say, the Queen of England,

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:20.139
you have to have a protocol.

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:23.420
You have to know her, you have to go by proper channel.

00:52:23.620 --> 00:52:26.457
You cannot just go and say, “Oh, Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth”.

00:52:26.658 --> 00:52:28.379
They’ll all arrest you there.

00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:31.159
And if you do chanting, then you get into troubles,

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.139
terrible trouble.

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:35.410
So you must have authority.

00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:37.249
God is not in your pocket,

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:39.460
that you go on chanting His name all the time.

00:52:39.677 --> 00:52:42.615
But what you have to do is to

00:52:42.816 --> 00:52:45.000
be in His Kingdom;

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:47.849
then even once if you take His name,

00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:50.625
you are blessed.

00:52:52.930 --> 00:52:57.450
Chanting is the most maddening thing, I think.

00:53:02.812 --> 00:53:07.002
There are a number of teachers, such as You say;

00:53:08.065 --> 00:53:13.875
they arrived to connect people to Divinity.

00:53:14.076 --> 00:53:16.825
On [unclear] born this divine time,

00:53:17.026 --> 00:53:19.678
what, how and what that relationship is

00:53:19.885 --> 00:53:23.868
between the teacher and those who do receive the connection?

00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:26.809
And whether it can be

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:29.036
whether it needs to be just one teacher

00:53:29.236 --> 00:53:32.045
or whether a number of teachers to be?

00:53:33.095 --> 00:53:35.969
Just stand before the light, I can't see.

00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:39.490
There is a number, he says there are a number of teachers

00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:43.200
who can make this connection for one with the Divinity.

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:46.340
I have not known any, so far.

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.090
I have not known any.

00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:51.760
They are all in the market and making money, that’s all.

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:54.465
I would like to know if there’s somebody else.

00:53:54.666 --> 00:53:57.405
But once you get your Realization,

00:53:57.606 --> 00:54:00.079
once you become a Sahaja Yogi,

00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:04.009
then you can give Realization to others. That’s different.

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:08.000
But I have not known anyone so far who is doing this.

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.398
If you know anyone, please let me know.

00:54:13.446 --> 00:54:16.310
What you see God as a [change]?

00:54:17.303 --> 00:54:18.403
Please translate.

00:54:18.604 --> 00:54:22.935
How do you see God, how do you describe God?

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:25.920
Should I describe Him just now?

00:54:27.250 --> 00:54:29.548
It is, we should say that

00:54:29.748 --> 00:54:35.826
God is the one who is

00:54:38.970 --> 00:54:41.650
the Divinity, we can call it Divinity.

00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:44.920
And the Divinity becomes active.

00:54:45.210 --> 00:54:47.935
It sleeps, and then it becomes active.

00:54:48.135 --> 00:54:50.279
When it becomes active,

00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:54.969
then we say that God is now awakened.

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:57.443
And when it is awakened,

00:54:57.644 --> 00:55:01.935
He separates Himself from His Power;

00:55:02.136 --> 00:55:05.500
and His Power is the Primordial Mother

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.969
as we call Her, or the Holy Ghost.

00:55:08.170 --> 00:55:12.680
And He is watching the work of the Holy Ghost.

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:16.169
She creates everything,

00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:19.760
She creates up to human beings,

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:24.800
and it is He who is watching it. He is the spectator.

00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.369
There are many things can be said,

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:31.100
because you see, God cannot be described in such a short time.

00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:33.280
But once you get your Realization

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:36.450
you start understanding what is God Almighty

00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:38.025
and what is His Power.

00:55:38.226 --> 00:55:40.260
But first you must have the light.

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:44.769
As I told you yesterday, now there are so many lights in this hall.

00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:46.520
Now if I start telling you

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:49.430
about the origin of this light and electricity

00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:52.539
and how it came here and all that, it’s a headache.

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:54.330
But what you have to do

00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:57.689
is to just put on one switch and it comes up.

00:55:57.890 --> 00:56:00.900
When you have the light, in that light if you see,

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:04.139
this subtle knowledge will be easily understood.

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:06.090
I am surprised that these people,

00:56:06.290 --> 00:56:09.289
who have never heard a name of Kundalini

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:13.279
and who had no idea of Divinity also much,

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:16.884
have become such experts in this knowledge, in such a short time,

00:56:17.085 --> 00:56:19.420
while it’s a very, very subtle knowledge.

00:56:19.971 --> 00:56:23.089
So gradually you will know everything.

00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:26.143
First you get your Realization.

00:56:27.323 --> 00:56:28.999
Now, again.

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:32.810
I just wanted to respond to what You said.

00:56:34.612 --> 00:56:37.644
The response we have among people is very similar

00:56:37.845 --> 00:56:39.570
to what You say, in terms of

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:41.980
“I don’t know of anybody else who is able to…”

00:56:42.181 --> 00:56:44.539
- Really? That’s all right.
So what it is?

00:56:44.740 --> 00:56:48.126
Yes, I really, I must tell you that they,

00:56:48.356 --> 00:56:51.745
I think these people understood there’s a market,

00:56:51.946 --> 00:56:55.969
because, you see, this is a special category of people you are.

00:56:56.170 --> 00:56:58.520
It's a special category, it's already described

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.359
as such a special category of people who will seek God

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.279
- they are called as “men of God” by William Blake -

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:06.951
will be on this Earth

00:57:07.152 --> 00:57:11.550
and they will know God,

00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:14.220
also they will make others men of God.

00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:18.054
This is described. So many of them have prophesized like that.

00:57:18.728 --> 00:57:22.180
But when they came to know about that such a thing exists,

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:24.820
they just started a market.

00:57:30.008 --> 00:57:34.646
I'm still confused. I have a connection with someone in India,

00:57:34.847 --> 00:57:38.570
by name [Shri Shritagu Balak Brahmachari]

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:39.886
What is he saying?

00:57:40.087 --> 00:57:41.879
and he responds in a similar way.

00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:44.860
He has a connection with somebody in India

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:47.320
who speaks in a similar way

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:49.253
about these things to Yourself.

00:57:49.454 --> 00:57:53.860
He's confused as to who are the genuine and who are the...

00:57:54.090 --> 00:57:58.068
You see, the genuineness is first to apply one thing,

00:57:58.269 --> 00:58:00.171
does he take money, first?

00:58:00.371 --> 00:58:02.939
Ninety-nine percent they’ll finished.

00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:07.240
Then you should say, does he give Realization to his disciples?

00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.020
You talk to the disciples. Have they got their Realization?

00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:11.929
Have they got any knowledge?

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:14.280
They know the modus operandi or not?

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:16.574
If they do not know, just

00:58:16.775 --> 00:58:19.170
they said, “Now, you are realized”, that’s not.

00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:20.830
They have to know each and everything.

00:58:21.031 --> 00:58:22.959
What is their depth of knowledge?

00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:26.189
First, as you go in the market, you see, find out

00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:29.219
so if somebody has purchased something, is it good,

00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:31.020
is really good, or not?

00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:34.320
In the same way when you are seeking something,

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:37.249
you must first really with a free mind

00:58:37.450 --> 00:58:40.709
go and see the disciples, what have they got,

00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:42.639
what have they achieved,

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:46.878
how are they, what sort of a life they are leading?

00:58:47.079 --> 00:58:50.120
It’s the best way if you want to really find out,

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:52.999
it’s the best way to do that.

00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:56.059
You should not just blindly go to something,

00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:59.039
and you should not just succumb to something

00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:00.428
because somebody says so.

00:59:00.629 --> 00:59:02.570
Even I, whatever I have said it,

00:59:02.771 --> 00:59:04.770
I said that you first experience.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.720
If you have the experience,

00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.820
then only you have to believe in yourself

00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:10.460
and you believe in Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:13.940
Not before that. It’s a blindness.

00:59:14.141 --> 00:59:17.450
But you can't have the experience unless you have the connection.

00:59:17.651 --> 00:59:18.736
- What’s he saying?

00:59:18.937 --> 00:59:21.200
That's  what we are here for tonight to give you that thing.

00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:23.452
Of course, now I am going to do it.

00:59:23.653 --> 00:59:25.515
Just go on saying. Do you remember what people said?

00:59:25.716 --> 00:59:26.870
Please say that I would like to finish,

00:59:27.071 --> 00:59:29.723
- What’s he saying?
and just give me the experience.

00:59:30.599 --> 00:59:32.556
- Can I answer that Shri Mataji?
- Yes.

00:59:32.757 --> 00:59:35.320
- That is exactly what we will give you.

00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:37.881
You see, Shri Mataji will give you that experience

00:59:38.081 --> 00:59:41.289
and then you can make connections [to upon].

00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:44.849
You are making the connections through that experience.

00:59:45.050 --> 00:59:46.538
- All right.
- That's not something

00:59:46.738 --> 00:59:48.394
that you have to believe or something you will favour...

00:59:48.595 --> 00:59:49.680
No, no, no.

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.439
No, no, no. Not at all it’s not thing like that.

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.650
You have to certify yourself.

00:59:54.850 --> 00:59:56.180
Now the experience is

00:59:56.381 --> 00:59:57.859
that you feel the cool breeze

00:59:58.059 --> 01:00:01.109
coming out of your fontanel bone area

01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:03.009
yourself.

01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:07.250
And also you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost all around you.

01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.175
This is to be certified by you only.

01:00:11.376 --> 01:00:14.170
But you should not also doubt yourself.

01:00:14.370 --> 01:00:15.880
Even so many feel, they'll say,

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:19.090
“This is due to this air-conditioning.”

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:22.499
Then they go home, close the windows, close the doors,

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:25.009
make it hermetically sealed. Still they feel.

01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:27.703
Then they say, “Now what is this?”

01:00:28.167 --> 01:00:30.680
So doubting up to a point is sensible,

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.471
but if you go beyond that

01:00:32.672 --> 01:00:35.147
then it’s harmful to you, not to anyone.

01:00:35.348 --> 01:00:38.894
Because I don’t need Sahaja Yoga, you need it.

01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:43.119
You need it.

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:46.570
You want it, you have to ask for it.

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:50.740
I cannot force on you. No, no, no way I can force you.

01:00:51.054 --> 01:00:53.969
You have to say “I want my Self-Realization.”

01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:55.921
In your freedom you have to ask,

01:00:56.122 --> 01:00:59.540
otherwise I cannot force. It cannot be forced.

01:01:00.488 --> 01:01:04.090
Now one more question and then we will start the...

01:01:04.490 --> 01:01:06.467
See person [started].

01:01:11.438 --> 01:01:12.760
I'm sorry.

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:17.538
Can healing capacity is aligned to ayurvedic medicine?

01:01:17.739 --> 01:01:19.712
So is usual...

01:01:19.912 --> 01:01:24.180
Is the healing capacity of Sahaja Yoga

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.180
aligned to ayurvedic medicine?

01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:29.070
What medicine?

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.899
Is the ability of Sahaja Yoga to heal

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.839
in any way connected with ayurvedic medicine?

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.930
Of course. There are two doctors

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:43.449
who have got their M.D. in Delhi,

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:44.890
in Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:47.756
They have shown how certain diseases are cured.

01:01:47.957 --> 01:01:50.679
They have taken three, four diseases, each person;

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.288
Now there’s third one who’s doing.

01:01:52.489 --> 01:01:54.442
And there are seven doctors in London

01:01:54.642 --> 01:01:56.319
who are doing experiments.

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:58.440
I mean, they are just trying to document it.

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:00.300
Those people have been cured.

01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:05.490
There are people, like blood cancers, nephritis, myelitis,

01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:07.849
all kinds of people have been cured,

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:10.290
So they are trying to document it.

01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:13.129
We have two hundred no, how many?

01:02:13.329 --> 01:02:15.999
Four hundred doctors in Russia

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.139
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:18.395 --> 01:02:20.340
It’s all related to it.

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:23.420
Because this is a new science, we can call it,

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:26.409
this is Meta-modernism,

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:29.739
when people are seeing something higher.

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:32.290
It is working out.

01:02:33.777 --> 01:02:34.880
But that doesn’t mean

01:02:35.081 --> 01:02:36.943
that we’ll take away all the practice of doctors.

01:02:37.144 --> 01:02:38.781
They should not be afraid of it.

01:02:38.981 --> 01:02:41.619
Because, you see,

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:45.099
we can only help people who get Realization,

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.730
not the people who do not get Realization.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:51.379
Those people who do not get Realization, we cannot help them.

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:54.980
So it is a by-product of your Realization.

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:09.450
Reincarnation, Shri Mataji. What are Your thoughts he's asking.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.720
Reincarnation. What are Your thoughts on reincarnation?

01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:19.040
You do reincarnate, no doubt, you do.

01:03:19.431 --> 01:03:21.200
But you should not believe whatever I say.

01:03:21.401 --> 01:03:23.158
Why should you believe that?

01:03:23.359 --> 01:03:26.449
Because I am saying that? You should find out yourself.

01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:28.460
You can find out in Sahaja Yoga

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:31.530
whatever I say is true or not.

01:03:34.452 --> 01:03:36.490
Whatever I say

01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:40.680
is for you to judge later on.

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:45.840
It’s all absolutely open.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:56.573
The biggest thing that Sahaja Yoga has achieved, I feel,

01:03:56.774 --> 01:03:58.559
more than medical,

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:04.320
is that they are absolutely free of addictions.

01:04:05.330 --> 01:04:07.439
People who came to Me

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:14.669
were so addicted to such horrible type of drugs,

01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:17.639
that when they came they couldn’t see Me even.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:19.760
They were like coma patients.

01:04:19.961 --> 01:04:22.299
And overnight they gave it up.

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:25.700
This is the biggest achievement today, I think.

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.599
And I feel very gratified for that,

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:33.580
because you must have heard how even small children

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.650
below twelve years of age in England,

01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:40.365
in one part of England, in the southern part,

01:04:40.565 --> 01:04:41.960
are taking drugs,

01:04:42.161 --> 01:04:44.930
which is such a dangerous thing.

01:04:51.164 --> 01:04:54.379
Because you become absolutely free,

01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:58.610
and capable of asserting your freedom.

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:07.900
Should we now have our Self-Realization, all of us?

01:05:22.925 --> 01:05:25.482
Before we start,

01:05:25.682 --> 01:05:30.760
I have to request you to take out your shoes,

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.300
because this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

01:05:49.425 --> 01:05:51.991
Not working?

01:05:52.191 --> 01:05:54.460
All right.

01:05:55.263 --> 01:05:57.239
Now, it's all right.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:01.070
Connections, you see, that’s the point!

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:08.340
Now there are two conditions

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:12.045
which you have to accept.

01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:17.966
First one is that at this moment you forget the past.

01:06:18.167 --> 01:06:20.966
Absolutely,

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:25.401
you should know that

01:06:25.655 --> 01:06:29.599
you have no business to condemn yourself,

01:06:31.851 --> 01:06:36.803
that you are not guilty at all of anything.

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:40.099
If you feel guilty,

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.890
then it’s another myth.

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:47.329
And at this time

01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:50.819
you have to know this All-pervading Power

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:53.559
is the ocean of forgiveness,

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.800
and you cannot commit any mistakes

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.259
which cannot be completely dissolved by this Power.

01:07:00.466 --> 01:07:03.011
So have confidence in yourself, please.

01:07:03.212 --> 01:07:05.600
These are very important conditions.

01:07:05.850 --> 01:07:07.580
Yesterday I met all of you,

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:10.593
but today I may not be able to meet you all.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.890
At least those whom I’ve met yesterday must have noticed that

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:19.579
I had to really correct them on these two points.

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:23.120
So please help Me, cooperate.

01:07:24.490 --> 01:07:30.009
Then secondly, the second condition is very simple,

01:07:30.210 --> 01:07:32.999
if you understand

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:40.412
that you have to forgive everyone, in general.

01:07:40.613 --> 01:07:44.332
Because logically, whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

01:07:44.533 --> 01:07:47.497
you don’t do anything. Logically, think about it.

01:07:47.698 --> 01:07:49.517
You don’t do anything,

01:07:49.718 --> 01:07:52.879
whether we forgive or we don’t forgive.

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.668
But if we don’t forgive,

01:07:55.869 --> 01:07:58.517
then we play into wrong hands.

01:07:58.718 --> 01:08:02.450
The people who have tortured us or troubled us or hurt us

01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:04.771
are quite happy, but we are the ones,

01:08:04.972 --> 01:08:08.349
by not forgiving are suffering.

01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:10.204
Now some people say it’s very difficult,

01:08:10.405 --> 01:08:12.119
but it is just a myth,

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.820
it’s just a bubble in your head.

01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:17.410
So just forgive all of them, once for all.

01:08:17.610 --> 01:08:20.060
I told yesterday those people who were not forgiving,

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:21.520
they got their Realization,

01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:24.450
“Tell all the flowers, all the trees and everyone loudly,

01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:26.280
".

01:08:26.690 --> 01:08:28.760
Don’t think about them also individually.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:33.093
Just say “All of them I have forgiven, in general”.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:38.000
It’s such a relief. Immediately you’ll feel the relief on your head.

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:41.480
It’s very important to forgive.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:46.080
And that you must have full confidence

01:08:46.281 --> 01:08:50.023
that you are all human beings, and you all are capable

01:08:50.224 --> 01:08:52.800
of getting Self-Realization.

01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:56.419
And “I will get my Realization”,

01:08:56.634 --> 01:09:00.086
that should be your

01:09:01.931 --> 01:09:06.665
full self-confidence. That is going to help us.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.420
Now as I have told you, that there’s left and right, two energies.

01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:17.899
The left is the energy of mundane desires,

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:20.340
everyday desires, not the pure desire.

01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:23.780
And the right is the energy of action.

01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:28.279
So you please put both your feet

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:31.960
little apart from each other, who are sitting on the chairs.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:34.397
Who are sitting on the ground are perfectly all right.

01:09:34.598 --> 01:09:36.579
They don’t have to worry.

01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:41.180
Now, please put your left hand towards Me.

01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:43.520
This is symbolic

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:46.340
that you really want your Self-Realization.

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:50.600
Those who do not want to have, I cannot force it on them

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.780
and they should

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:57.699
in all civility leave the hall,

01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:00.769
because they can disturb others’ ascent.

01:10:00.970 --> 01:10:03.916
So to be civil to others, they should leave the hall.

01:10:04.117 --> 01:10:06.960
But those who want to have their Self-Realization

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.572
have to do this much, is

01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:14.378
to do what I’m telling you;

01:10:14.593 --> 01:10:19.752
and hardly ten minutes will take

01:10:19.953 --> 01:10:22.439
to have your Self-Realization.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.500
So just left hand towards Me,

01:10:24.701 --> 01:10:26.428
the right hand is to be used

01:10:26.629 --> 01:10:30.629
for nourishing your different centers.

01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:35.344
So you put first your right hand on your heart.

01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:44.110
This is the center of the Spirit.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.339
The Spirit resides in your heart,

01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:51.942
but its seat is here; but it resides in your heart.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:56.309
It resides in your heart.

01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:58.580
Then you take down your right hand

01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:01.640
in the upper portion of your abdomen.

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.839
This is the center of your mastery,

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.882
which has been created by great masters and prophets.

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.044
Then you take down your right hand

01:11:15.245 --> 01:11:18.140
in the lower portion of your abdomen.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.438
This is the center of pure knowledge,

01:11:23.638 --> 01:11:25.319
absolute knowledge;

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.520
knowledge about the divine powers,

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.490
its laws, which work through your being.

01:11:31.690 --> 01:11:33.290
You don’t have to know mentally,

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:36.719
but they are manifested through your being

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:38.539
pure knowledge.

01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:40.903
As you can see Me,

01:11:41.103 --> 01:11:43.299
as you can feel something,

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:47.500
in the same way, this pure knowledge works through you.

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:53.005
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen.

01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:59.754
Then again on your heart.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.677
Then in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, as I told you,

01:12:04.878 --> 01:12:07.640
that when you feel guilty this center goes out of order,

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:11.220
and turn your head to your right, completely.

01:12:14.420 --> 01:12:16.299
Here is the center where

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:19.010
you have to forgive yourself completely,

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:22.410
and to know that you are not guilty at all.

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:31.119
Now take your right hand on your forehand across,

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:36.080
like this, and gently put down your head as far as possible,

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:38.640
resting on your hand.

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:41.570
This is the center

01:12:41.771 --> 01:12:45.945
where you have to forgive everyone in general.

01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:52.617
Now you have to take your right hand on the back side of your head,

01:12:52.817 --> 01:12:54.195
back side of your head,

01:12:54.396 --> 01:12:57.369
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:12:57.570 --> 01:13:01.007
Push it back as far as possible.

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:08.000
This is the center where, without feeling guilty,

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.380
without counting your mistakes

01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:15.412
you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power.

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:19.860
Now stretch your palm. I’m just telling you how to do it;

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:22.250
then later on we’ll do it in a proper way.

01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:25.069
Now stretch your palm fully,

01:13:25.269 --> 01:13:29.476
and put the center of your palm

01:13:29.677 --> 01:13:32.479
exactly on the fontanel bone area,

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.900
which was the soft bone in your childhood.

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:40.760
Now please put down your head as far as possible,

01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:42.866
please put it down,

01:13:43.067 --> 01:13:49.009
and now start moving your scalp.

01:13:49.210 --> 01:13:51.970
Push back your fingers, otherwise there’s no proper pressure.

01:13:52.171 --> 01:13:54.360
Please push back your fingers nicely.

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.379
Now move your scalp with that pressure

01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.849
not the hand so much as the scalp

01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:02.280
seven times, clockwise.

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:05.739
Put down your head please, push back your fingers,

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:10.680
and move your scalp slowly seven times.

01:14:13.980 --> 01:14:16.186
Very slowly,

01:14:19.231 --> 01:14:21.670
with a proper pressure.

01:14:35.719 --> 01:14:39.207
Done. That’s all we have to do.

01:14:39.408 --> 01:14:42.890
Now I will request you to take out your spectacles

01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:45.379
because you have to close your eyes,

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:50.380
and till I tell you, please don’t open your eyes.

01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:55.548
Move your legs apart from each other,

01:14:55.749 --> 01:15:01.519
and please put your left hand towards Me

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:04.419
and right hand on your heart,

01:15:04.620 --> 01:15:08.320
and now, if there is anything

01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:12.115
that is tight on your neck or on your waist,

01:15:12.316 --> 01:15:17.087
please reduce the pressure, be comfortable,

01:15:17.288 --> 01:15:21.674
sit straight, not too much bending or bending back

01:15:21.875 --> 01:15:25.710
but in a comfortable way, in a very comfortable way.

01:15:25.980 --> 01:15:30.632
Now, you have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:37.929
Now, please put your right hand on your heart.

01:15:55.606 --> 01:15:57.461
Here you have to ask Me

01:15:57.662 --> 01:16:00.930
a very fundamental question about yourself,

01:16:01.854 --> 01:16:04.960
because I told you, you have to become a divine computer.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.620
So first you use Me for that.

01:16:07.820 --> 01:16:10.690
Now ask a question, in your heart -

01:16:10.890 --> 01:16:14.810
you can call Me “Shri Mataji” or “Mother” whatever you like -

01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:17.210
ask a question three times,

01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:20.850
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask sincerely.

01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:24.701
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask three times.

01:16:44.957 --> 01:16:47.615
Now,

01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:56.130
if you are the Spirit,

01:16:56.330 --> 01:16:57.880
you are your master,

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.487
because in that light you know,

01:17:01.688 --> 01:17:04.079
what is right, what is wrong,

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.320
and you become your own guide.

01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:07.900
So now put your right hand

01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:10.730
in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side.

01:17:10.930 --> 01:17:13.673
We are only working on the left-hand side.

01:17:13.874 --> 01:17:16.719
Press it hard. And here

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:20.362
you ask another question three times,

01:17:20.593 --> 01:17:25.420
“Mother, am I my own master?”

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:27.969
Ask this question three times,

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:32.780
“Mother, am I my own master?”

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:40.819
I have already told you that I respect your freedom.

01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:45.829
I cannot force pure knowledge upon you.

01:17:47.490 --> 01:17:49.839
So now please put your right hand

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:52.879
in the lower portion of your abdomen.

01:17:53.140 --> 01:18:00.233
Here you have to ask, three times,

01:18:01.690 --> 01:18:03.858
six times, because this petal,

01:18:04.058 --> 01:18:07.249
this, this center has got six petals.

01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:10.610
Please ask six times,

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:17.640
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge.”

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:19.610
Please say that six times,

01:18:19.810 --> 01:18:22.960
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge.”

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:27.579
Say it in humility; you are asking for the highest.

01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:30.680
Six times, please.

01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:55.159
When you ask for pure knowledge

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:58.079
your Kundalini starts rising.

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:01.170
So we have to clear our upper centers

01:19:01.370 --> 01:19:05.469
with our self-confidence.

01:19:05.670 --> 01:19:07.000
So raise your right hand

01:19:07.201 --> 01:19:09.880
in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side,

01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.170
and here you press it hard

01:19:12.371 --> 01:19:17.999
and say with full confidence ten times, ten times,

01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:21.780
“Mother, I am my own master”.

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:25.089
“Mother, I am my own master”.

01:19:25.290 --> 01:19:27.090
Please say.

01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:32.400
Ten times.

01:19:46.050 --> 01:19:47.410
As I told you

01:19:47.610 --> 01:19:52.200
that you are not this body, this mind, this ego,

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:54.429
these conditionings,

01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:59.837
but you are the pure Spirit.

01:20:00.759 --> 01:20:06.220
So now please raise your right hand on your heart.

01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:11.880
Here now, say with full confidence, twelve times,

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:15.500
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit”.

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:18.420
Please say it twelve times,

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:22.899
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit”.

01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:26.356
Please put your hand on your heart.

01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:31.559
This divine Power,

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:34.769
is the ocean of knowledge,

01:20:34.970 --> 01:20:39.368
is the ocean of love, compassion and bliss;

01:20:39.569 --> 01:20:43.800
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness,

01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:46.680
and you can not commit any mistakes

01:20:46.890 --> 01:20:49.584
which cannot be dissolved

01:20:49.785 --> 01:20:54.189
by this great power of forgiveness.

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:57.739
So please forgive yourself,

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:02.210
and put your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

01:21:02.410 --> 01:21:04.969
and turn your head to your right.

01:21:05.170 --> 01:21:07.564
Here, please help Me,

01:21:07.765 --> 01:21:10.080
by saying with full confidence,

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:14.155
“Mother, I am not guilty at all”.

01:21:14.356 --> 01:21:18.582
Just say that, with full confidence, please.

01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:34.381
You have to say that, please,

01:21:34.582 --> 01:21:37.256
sixteen times.

01:21:42.207 --> 01:21:44.259
I have already told you

01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:48.545
that if you forgive or don’t forgive,

01:21:48.746 --> 01:21:52.314
you do not do anything. It’s a myth,

01:21:52.515 --> 01:21:53.697
absolute myth.

01:21:53.898 --> 01:21:55.849
But if you don’t forgive,

01:21:56.050 --> 01:22:00.819
then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself.

01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:03.103
So give up this myth, once for all,

01:22:03.304 --> 01:22:05.560
just give up this myth!

01:22:06.170 --> 01:22:08.662
Now raise your right hand

01:22:08.863 --> 01:22:11.986
onto your forehead across,

01:22:12.187 --> 01:22:16.531
and put down your head as far as possible.

01:22:17.540 --> 01:22:23.130
Now, here, you have to say, not how many times but with

01:22:24.910 --> 01:22:27.279
your heart in it.

01:22:27.494 --> 01:22:29.759
Say it,

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:36.179
“Mother, I forgive everyone in general.”

01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:38.750
Just say that,

01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:44.170
from your heart.

01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:08.709
Now take back your right hand on the back side of your head,

01:23:08.910 --> 01:23:13.200
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:18.990
Here,

01:23:21.370 --> 01:23:23.300
without feeling guilty,

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.160
without counting your mistakes,

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.340
just for your satisfaction,

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:30.109
you have to say

01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:33.820
from your heart, not how many times,

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:36.310
“Oh divine Power,

01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:39.918
if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly,

01:23:40.119 --> 01:23:42.040
please forgive me”.

01:23:42.630 --> 01:23:44.420
Say it from your heart,

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:46.070
“Oh divine Power,

01:23:46.270 --> 01:23:51.086
if I have done anything, against you or any mistakes,

01:23:51.287 --> 01:23:53.379
please forgive me”.

01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:57.000
That’s all you have to say, from your heart.

01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:01.850
Stretch back your head, fully.

01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:13.400
Now, stretch your hand fully.

01:24:32.090 --> 01:24:36.280
And put the center of your palm

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:41.449
on top of your fontanel bone area,

01:24:41.650 --> 01:24:46.212
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:03.221
Now, bend your head as far as possible.

01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:08.054
Now, push back your fingers,

01:25:08.254 --> 01:25:11.690
to have a good pressure on your scalp.

01:25:12.730 --> 01:25:15.769
Here again, I cannot force

01:25:15.970 --> 01:25:20.009
Self-Realization on you, I cannot force.

01:25:20.210 --> 01:25:23.549
So you have to ask for it.

01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:28.510
Now move your scalp slowly, seven times,

01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:32.139
saying seven times,

01:25:32.340 --> 01:25:35.840
“Mother, please give me Self-Realization”,

01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:38.290
saying seven times,

01:25:38.490 --> 01:25:42.570
“Mother, please give me Self-Realization”.

01:26:31.930 --> 01:26:34.655
Please open your eyes, slowly.

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:37.933
Put down your hands.

01:26:39.903 --> 01:26:44.170
Now please put both your hands towards Me, like this.

01:26:48.288 --> 01:26:52.999
Put your right hand towards Me, like this,

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.129
and now put down your head,

01:26:56.330 --> 01:27:00.249
and see if you are getting yourself

01:27:00.450 --> 01:27:05.392
a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:27:05.593 --> 01:27:07.976
Just see for yourself.

01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:13.130
Now don’t put the hand on top of your head, but away from it.

01:27:13.330 --> 01:27:16.640
And sometimes you might get it much further.

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:20.250
You can also move your hand to see

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:23.859
if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:28.120
Now don’t doubt about the air-conditioner,

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:31.643
because it’s coming out of your head.

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:36.572
Now,

01:27:37.140 --> 01:27:40.300
put your left hand towards Me,

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:46.179
and put down your head.

01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:49.800
And now see with your right hand, right hand,

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.360
if you are getting a cool or a hot breeze

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:58.431
out of your fontanel bone area.

01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:05.600
Now, again put your right hand towards Me,

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:07.710
right hand like this.

01:28:08.210 --> 01:28:09.948
Put down your head.

01:28:10.178 --> 01:28:13.009
See for last time, see clearly,

01:28:13.210 --> 01:28:17.059
if there’s a cool or a hot breeze

01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:19.481
may be slight, might be more coming.

01:28:19.681 --> 01:28:21.439
Don’t get confused.

01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:24.891
See for yourself, your attention.

01:28:25.097 --> 01:28:27.406
It’s coming out.

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:33.059
Now put both the hands towards Me like this,

01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:35.600
and watch Me without thinking.

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:39.334
You will see that there’s no thought in your mind.

01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:45.569
Now raise both your hands

01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:48.544
towards the sky like this,

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:53.540
and ask another fundamental question,

01:28:53.740 --> 01:28:56.354
“Mother, is this the...

01:28:56.561 --> 01:29:00.171
Mother is this the breeze,

01:29:02.830 --> 01:29:06.760
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:10.800
"Mother,

01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:16.689
is this the All-pervading Power of divine love?

01:29:16.890 --> 01:29:20.220
Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?”

01:29:20.450 --> 01:29:22.580
Ask anyone of these questions three times.

01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:25.169
Put back your head completely.

01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:28.140
Push back your head completely,

01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:33.020
and ask this question, anyone of them, three times.

01:29:35.770 --> 01:29:37.356
Now take down your hands.

01:29:37.556 --> 01:29:40.293
Such flowing of vibrations!

01:29:45.850 --> 01:29:50.910
All those who have felt cool breeze on your fingertips,

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:53.009
in your hands,

01:29:53.209 --> 01:29:58.789
or on top of your fontanel bone area,

01:29:58.990 --> 01:30:00.621
please raise both your hands.

01:30:00.822 --> 01:30:03.463
Please raise both your hands.

01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:12.480
May God bless you all.

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:16.020
May God bless you all.

01:30:16.220 --> 01:30:18.149
Now you should know, it has not happened

01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:20.280
through any mental activity.

01:30:20.530 --> 01:30:22.980
So you cannot argue it out, you cannot discuss it,

01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:25.480
but you have to just feel it and grow into it.

01:30:25.710 --> 01:30:28.349
Another thing I would suggest that

01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:32.260
it’s not an individual procedure,

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:35.400
it’s a collective procedure, it’s a collective thing.

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:39.120
Like one nail, which falls out of your body,

01:30:39.320 --> 01:30:41.249
it’s not looked after. In the same way,

01:30:41.450 --> 01:30:44.200
if you say that “I am doing it at home, Mother, it’s all right”,

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:47.309
that’s not the thing. You have to come to our collective.

01:30:47.510 --> 01:30:51.590
And we have a very nice collective arrangements here

01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:53.212
where you can come,

01:30:53.413 --> 01:30:55.429
and you can tell your problems,

01:30:55.630 --> 01:30:57.620
and you can master this art,

01:30:57.820 --> 01:30:59.240
absolutely master.

01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:02.390
I hope next year I’ll come to Melbourne

01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:04.720
and I’ll find lots of people

01:31:05.010 --> 01:31:07.170
who have achieved this mastery.

01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:09.440
I bless you all from My heart.

01:31:09.710 --> 01:31:11.840
Those who have not felt cool breeze

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.280
can come on this side.

01:31:13.481 --> 01:31:15.480
So I may not be able to meet all of you,

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:18.460
though I wanted very much to meet all of you today again,

01:31:18.660 --> 01:31:22.770
but we’ll have some music for you to enjoy. Please!

01:31:26.170 --> 01:31:28.010
Just....

01:31:33.854 --> 01:31:35.291
Sit down. Yes.

01:31:35.503 --> 01:31:37.670
Make a... We have a special announcement to make.

01:31:37.871 --> 01:31:40.331
So please, please.

01:31:48.029 --> 01:31:50.302
She wants what?

01:31:50.881 --> 01:31:52.506
I will follow.

01:31:52.706 --> 01:31:54.203
Water, all right, please come.

01:31:54.404 --> 01:31:57.221
Give her some. Is there any other glass?

01:31:58.011 --> 01:32:01.749
Some other glass. Just put some other glass, please.

01:32:04.890 --> 01:32:08.390
It’s difficult for Me.  It’s all right for a child.

01:32:34.568 --> 01:32:37.095
So, yes, how are you?

01:32:37.314 --> 01:32:40.699
Mother, they came for Sahaja Yoga in July,

01:32:40.899 --> 01:32:42.967
- They are here.
- Who?

01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:46.131
There is one with wheelchair and the one behind.

01:32:46.331 --> 01:32:48.417
- She's all right?
- Yes, she's there.

01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:51.343
- Ah, She is the one?
- The young, the young one there.

01:32:51.544 --> 01:32:54.340
- Yes, really! What trouble they had?

01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:56.160
That one was paralyzed.

01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:59.070
Now she can move left hand and the [right foot]...

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:04.563
Amjad! Amjad! Doctor Amjad Ali, please come along.

01:33:05.119 --> 01:33:07.762
Are you here?

01:33:08.410 --> 01:33:09.896
We will just talk to them,

01:33:10.096 --> 01:33:11.739
and he has to take their,

01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:14.717
they must be having their medical reports.

01:33:14.924 --> 01:33:16.628
No, they haven't, because they live,

01:33:16.829 --> 01:33:20.435
that one, she lives in nursing house where is no doctor.

01:33:20.636 --> 01:33:23.508
They look after [unclear]. We do [unclear] and send to you

01:33:23.709 --> 01:33:25.153
- before nursing her.
- Yes.

01:33:25.354 --> 01:33:27.620
Here, they haven't, but everybody can see it.

01:33:27.821 --> 01:33:30.689
She is still in chair but she can move the left leg.

01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:33.970
So I think I’ll ask Amjad to file it,

01:33:34.170 --> 01:33:38.020
because we have to send certain documents

01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:39.776
of people being cured here.

01:33:39.976 --> 01:33:41.600
Yes, I'll take down.

01:33:41.801 --> 01:33:45.292
Yes, but I’ll tell Doctor Amjad to help you.

01:33:45.499 --> 01:33:48.175
But I go to bring Nirmala.

01:33:48.376 --> 01:33:50.229
I go to bring her here?

01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:53.567
Not necessary, it’s all right.

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.326
Somebody is outside who is hurt,

01:34:08.527 --> 01:34:11.476
and the doctor is helping him at the moment.

01:34:11.676 --> 01:34:13.763
- Hurt what?
- [unclear]

01:34:13.964 --> 01:34:14.964
How?

01:34:15.165 --> 01:34:16.872
Like walking through the door and he had some glasses...

01:34:17.073 --> 01:34:19.189
and wearing the glasses and they [stepped] on that.

01:34:19.390 --> 01:34:22.400
Bring them here, I’ll cure.
