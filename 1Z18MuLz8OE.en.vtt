WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:11.490
Divine to work out its working.

00:11.490 --> 00:19.239
Because Divine can go up to a point, that’s
the trouble.

00:19.239 --> 00:25.119
It has no interest in your money, nor in your
position or anything.

00:25.119 --> 00:32.989
It has only one interest: that you should
take to Divine love.

00:32.989 --> 00:47.140
And if you go on accepting something that
is stupid

00:47.140 --> 00:50.850
how can Divine help you?

00:50.850 --> 01:01.079
I have been thinking on these lines all through
and I have talked to some of those who came

01:01.079 --> 01:07.820
to us that, “How is is [that] you never
discovered that they were false gurus?”

01:07.820 --> 01:11.220
They said, “We could see.

01:11.220 --> 01:15.460
There was something in us that was saying
that, ‘There’s something false about this

01:15.460 --> 01:16.460
gentleman.’”

01:16.460 --> 01:20.420
And still, why did you continue?

01:20.420 --> 01:30.430
They said, “Because we were walking in a
dark alley and didn’t know whether we were

01:30.430 --> 01:38.360
walking forwards or backwards and they said,
‘Go on and on and on,’ promising us about

01:38.360 --> 01:39.780
the future.”

01:39.780 --> 01:43.930
And that’s the point.

01:43.930 --> 01:50.530
Because you are futuristic, you are people
who are futuristic, you do not want to believe

01:50.530 --> 01:53.399
that you can get your Realisation today.

01:53.399 --> 01:54.579
You just don’t want to believe it.

01:54.579 --> 02:01.840
You don’t want to listen to that person
who says, “You can get your Realisation

02:01.840 --> 02:02.840
today.”

02:02.840 --> 02:04.969
You want to keep it for the future.

02:04.969 --> 02:08.899
Everything postponed for the future.

02:08.899 --> 02:16.100
And that’s why you go on living with it,
till you are completely finished and wrecked,

02:16.100 --> 02:21.410
when Kundalini cannot rise, when you cannot
get your Realisation.

02:21.410 --> 02:32.819
I think the worst thing this futuristic society
has done to us is that we always postpone

02:32.819 --> 02:34.640
even our Self-realisation.

02:34.640 --> 02:36.380
Can you imagine?

02:36.380 --> 02:44.350
It’s a very sad thing.

02:44.350 --> 02:51.360
This kind of postponement is going to lead
us into great troubles.

02:51.360 --> 02:59.690
The Divine Power today is so active, so activated.

02:59.690 --> 03:04.790
It was never so activated, I can tell you.

03:04.790 --> 03:09.880
Those who are Realised-souls can see that.

03:09.880 --> 03:20.150
At the time of Vedas the Divine Power which
looked like small sparks of light, which you

03:20.150 --> 03:27.480
can see, the Realised-souls can see, was called
as ‘bhargo’, ‘bharga’.

03:27.480 --> 03:35.540
And in the main mantra of Vedas it was written
that, “Make me such that I should be able

03:35.540 --> 03:46.360
to see that bharga, that Divine sparkle, in
the sky,” which Sahaja Yogis can see.

03:46.360 --> 03:54.560
And for that people were willing to sacrifice
anything to get to that state where they could

03:54.560 --> 03:56.660
at least see that.

03:56.660 --> 04:06.130
But today, because of futuristic society,
we’ll also say that, “Alright, we’ll

04:06.130 --> 04:09.460
see it tomorrow, not today.

04:09.460 --> 04:14.060
Leave it for tomorrow.”

04:14.060 --> 04:32.599
Now this power, today, is so very active it
was never that active, it was never that sensitive.

04:32.599 --> 04:43.941
Today that Divine Power is extremely sensitive
and those people who are simple people, who

04:43.941 --> 04:47.440
are not futuristic by temperament, can feel
it.

04:47.440 --> 04:56.990
They are so sensitive to it [that] in a split
of a second you can give Realisation to thousands

04:56.990 --> 04:58.900
of these people.

04:58.900 --> 05:08.520
So, I personally think that one should try
to feel this Divine Power, those who are Realised-souls,

05:08.520 --> 05:12.159
in its all aspects.

05:12.159 --> 05:19.979
And the greatest aspect of it is that, today
it is very active.

05:19.979 --> 05:27.060
It is very active because so many people are
Realised-souls on this Earth.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.820
Because of you.

05:30.820 --> 05:35.249
It is working out things in such a dimension.

05:35.249 --> 05:39.159
I mean, you can see the result of this yourself.

05:39.159 --> 05:44.509
For example, when the Sahaja Yogis got this
ashram they were amazed.

05:44.509 --> 05:50.930
But it’s the blessing of the Divine Power.

05:50.930 --> 05:54.400
You know how knowledgeable it is.

05:54.400 --> 06:03.599
A tree which is a mango tree will have to
give mango fruits.

06:03.599 --> 06:15.159
This power first sprouts the tree, chooses
all of them in such a way that a mango tree

06:15.159 --> 06:21.500
gives a mango.

06:21.500 --> 06:29.080
Any other tree will [also] give the fruit
that it has.

06:29.080 --> 06:32.830
The child is born to a mother.

06:32.830 --> 06:39.759
People have not heard that dogs are born to
human beings.

06:39.759 --> 06:42.949
A human child is born to a human being.

06:42.949 --> 06:52.389
So many forces have been active before but
today the spiritual force is so magnetic and

06:52.389 --> 06:55.900
so great.

06:55.900 --> 07:03.930
And the greatest of work it has done [is to]
bring forth so many seekers in this world.

07:03.930 --> 07:09.669
It’s the Divine force which has brought
all of you on this Earth.

07:09.669 --> 07:20.680
And now the only problem is of guiding them
to the right lines.

07:20.680 --> 07:27.499
Now, the Divine Power [which] can be called
as the ‘Universal Unconscious’ for people

07:27.499 --> 07:37.900
who are not Realised-souls, can give you dreams
and you can understand through dreams the

07:37.900 --> 07:46.539
symbols, if you could, or even clearly see
things by which you can come to Sahaja Yoga.

07:46.539 --> 07:51.150
And you can find your Self-realisation.

07:51.150 --> 07:57.419
But when a person sleeps, in a deep sleep,
he goes to a state called ‘shushupti’.

07:57.419 --> 08:00.909
There he does see many things.

08:00.909 --> 08:09.159
But when he’s returning to consciousness,
that time, there are other layers which cover

08:09.159 --> 08:12.219
you up, your memory.

08:12.219 --> 08:19.339
Here also the futuristic temperament is responsible.

08:19.339 --> 08:25.839
The people who are futuristic have got a very
bad memory.

08:25.839 --> 08:35.390
Their past is cut out and even when they go
into their depth, their memory itself is inactive.

08:35.390 --> 08:44.200
Apart from that the mind of a modern man is
so full of thoughts and ideas.

08:44.200 --> 08:52.630
There’s so much of pressure and load on
his head, that by the time he comes to his

08:52.630 --> 09:00.030
consciousness, all that he has seen in the
dreams becomes to zero and the superficial

09:00.030 --> 09:05.400
dreams of this present day life cover it up.

09:05.400 --> 09:16.430
So that even the glimpse of that is not convincing
or maybe it cannot guide.

09:16.430 --> 09:26.690
The telecommunication system of the Divine
is through dreams, to human beings, but only

09:26.690 --> 09:33.020
the dreams we see in the state of shushupti.

09:33.020 --> 09:42.450
For a Realised-soul it is easy to be in that
state, to remember it, and to forget about

09:42.450 --> 09:54.540
all useless things because he is no more identified
with the mundane things of life, with the

09:54.540 --> 10:03.210
useless things of life.

10:03.210 --> 10:09.630
But the guidance of these dreams, I have seen
some people had these dreams.

10:09.630 --> 10:12.080
In Rome, I was surprised.

10:12.080 --> 10:22.530
In Rome, so many people came to my programme
because they saw me in a dream.

10:22.530 --> 10:33.260
There was an actress who saw me in her dreams
and she came to see me and then she came to

10:33.260 --> 10:40.880
talk to me later on and she told me that,
“Mother I saw you in my dreams.”

10:40.880 --> 10:49.190
And clearly she saw me as something that was
important to her.

10:49.190 --> 10:58.140
The activity of this Divine force is also
marred when we are taking our spiritual life

10:58.140 --> 11:02.470
to some sort of an organised religious form.

11:02.470 --> 11:10.320
Now, any religious form, say Indian religious
form or say an English or say a Christian

11:10.320 --> 11:13.560
religious form, has deviated from reality.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.810
One must accept it.

11:14.810 --> 11:17.730
It’s a fact, whatever you may say.

11:17.730 --> 11:27.790
That churches or temples or all these religions,
which were really meant for Sahaja Yoga today

11:27.790 --> 11:29.810
– there it is.

11:29.810 --> 11:33.110
I have to go and work.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.340
But where are they?

11:34.340 --> 11:36.660
They are going to deny me completely.

11:36.660 --> 11:38.800
Why will they accept me?

11:38.800 --> 11:43.060
If I am the redeemer I have to look after
them isn’t it?

11:43.060 --> 11:46.530
But they are not going to accept me at all.

11:46.530 --> 11:55.990
On the contrary they’ll be against me because
their activities are either money activities

11:55.990 --> 12:01.410
or you can say the other organisational activities
and all these nonsensical activities, which

12:01.410 --> 12:08.070
has no meaning as far as the Spirit is concerned.

12:08.070 --> 12:18.940
So all such people who are extremely overpowered
by these ideas…now just look at the dogmas

12:18.940 --> 12:21.160
that people are fighting for.

12:21.160 --> 12:27.010
Like, I can’t understand that Catholics
and the Protestants are saying that there

12:27.010 --> 12:28.290
are lots of differences.

12:28.290 --> 12:31.080
How can you have when the essence is Christ.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.630
Essence is Christ.

12:32.630 --> 12:37.270
How can you have differences if you believe
in Christ.

12:37.270 --> 12:46.380
At least on that point you cannot have difference.

12:46.380 --> 12:53.280
And once you have all these dogmas covering
you and these differences in you, you are

12:53.280 --> 13:03.330
identified all the time with something that
is really dead, is done by your mental projection,

13:03.330 --> 13:10.800
so whatever this power may try, how far can
you take it?

13:10.800 --> 13:21.490
And from this deadening thing, when you start
to get out of it, you will land up into another

13:21.490 --> 13:27.800
problems like these fake gurus.

13:27.800 --> 13:34.290
And they are on and on and on because for
them it does not matter if somebody is ruined,

13:34.290 --> 13:39.340
somebody is suffering from any diseases, doesn’t
matter at all, it is what they earn out of

13:39.340 --> 13:40.450
you.

13:40.450 --> 13:43.180
So they cheat you today.

13:43.180 --> 13:46.120
If you get out they have another lot which
is willing to be cheated.

13:46.120 --> 13:53.040
They go on and on and on.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.030
They mesmerise you.

13:55.030 --> 13:56.280
They keep you completely under their control.

13:56.280 --> 13:57.280
They brainwash you.

13:57.280 --> 14:06.480
And there is nothing in between: one side
is this darkness of organised ways of looking

14:06.480 --> 14:17.190
at things and another is this kind of mesmeric
imprisonment from where you cannot get out.

14:17.190 --> 14:25.100
Where is the freedom?

14:25.100 --> 14:40.070
And whatever one may try to work out it is
impossible to convince a person who is enslave

14:40.070 --> 14:43.030
with his own will.

14:43.030 --> 14:49.700
Mesmerism is nothing but imprisonment with
your own will.

14:49.700 --> 14:55.970
You have accepted to be mesmerised, you are
accepting it, you are going on and on and

14:55.970 --> 15:00.930
when there is a pull still going on all the
time that there’s something wrong with this

15:00.930 --> 15:01.930
person.

15:01.930 --> 15:06.250
There’s something wrong with this kind of
Christianity and this kind of Hinduism and

15:06.250 --> 15:10.640
this kind of Islam and all those things.

15:10.640 --> 15:16.550
But still you go on with it because you have
accepted that enslavement with your own desire.

15:16.550 --> 15:18.600
It sustains your ego.

15:18.600 --> 15:26.100
You think you have been with it throughout
so you should [continue to] be.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.770
But what about your Spirit?

15:28.770 --> 15:34.350
What about getting your second birth?

15:34.350 --> 15:36.150
That is in future – next life!

15:36.150 --> 15:41.360
This life it’s not possible.

15:41.360 --> 15:52.680
It should not be an impossible task but the
situation is such today that the whole world

15:52.680 --> 16:00.240
is in a trauma, in a shock and the people
who know about the future don’t want to

16:00.240 --> 16:06.700
look at it, in a way, those who really can
see it because it shows horrible things which

16:06.700 --> 16:09.790
can happen to us, the way we are moving.

16:09.790 --> 16:12.920
Those who know about it know it.

16:12.920 --> 16:19.930
And human beings are intelligent enough to
understand that there is something definitely

16:19.930 --> 16:26.260
wrong with our whole system and we have not
been able to correct it.

16:26.260 --> 16:28.250
Also they have reached this state.

16:28.250 --> 16:31.150
They are not ignorant people today.

16:31.150 --> 16:34.050
They are knowledgeable, they understand this.

16:34.050 --> 16:40.380
Whether they are with the science or not,
whether they are with the Churches or not,

16:40.380 --> 16:49.450
in their heart of hearts I am sure there is
a kind of an understanding which makes them

16:49.450 --> 16:53.810
understand [that] this is not the answer.

16:53.810 --> 17:00.920
Definitely they have this idea, I am sure
of every one of them who are still a little

17:00.920 --> 17:03.660
bit left free.

17:03.660 --> 17:07.669
Maybe a priest would not think like that,
but I can’t even think of a priest who would

17:07.669 --> 17:10.639
not think like that, “There’s something
wrong with this system.

17:10.639 --> 17:12.459
I’m [going] on and on with this.

17:12.459 --> 17:17.170
I have been doing it every day, day in and
day out, I’m preaching every day but that’s

17:17.170 --> 17:18.829
not the end.”

17:18.829 --> 17:23.240
I mean, if they are dishonest, if they could
be dishonest to themselves to that extent

17:23.240 --> 17:29.950
I can’t say, but they must be thinking [that]
there is a way out.

17:29.950 --> 17:44.480
But that doubting is killed every moment by
giving a new supply of explanations.

17:44.480 --> 17:50.670
In the science also there are many people
who understand that science is not the end

17:50.670 --> 17:51.770
of everything.

17:51.770 --> 17:55.620
It doesn’t give you answers to everything.

17:55.620 --> 18:01.960
In politics also people realise that it’s
a confusion, you can’t say what is right,

18:01.960 --> 18:03.840
what is wrong.

18:03.840 --> 18:12.429
The other day I was seeing a very peculiar
type of an argument which was really very

18:12.429 --> 18:18.999
foreign to me as an Indian, that they were
discussing whether to keep the children with

18:18.999 --> 18:24.559
the parents or not, how to remove the children,
when to remove, how to delimit.

18:24.559 --> 18:29.159
I mean, I can’t think of an Indian ever
proposing such a thing.

18:29.159 --> 18:35.249
Such a government will go to the dust in India
if you say such a thing that, “We’ll remove

18:35.249 --> 18:36.389
your children from you.”

18:36.389 --> 18:40.990
But that’s a different society, this is
a different society.

18:40.990 --> 18:45.169
But such a confusion between them that [they]
didn’t know whether they should remove the

18:45.169 --> 18:51.279
children from the parents, they didn’t know
whether, if you remove the children, then

18:51.279 --> 19:01.640
are you really going to help the children
or not, if the parents are cruel what’s

19:01.640 --> 19:03.909
going to happen?

19:03.909 --> 19:06.029
I mean, I can’t think of parents being that
cruel.

19:06.029 --> 19:09.200
I cannot think [like that] myself, because
we had no wars.

19:09.200 --> 19:13.169
You had wars, maybe, people have become warmongers.

19:13.169 --> 19:19.950
Still, parents being that cruel that you have
to remove children from them is something

19:19.950 --> 19:24.799
unnatural, absolutely unnatural, because nature
has given you children and nature has given

19:24.799 --> 19:31.169
you that love and how is it that in between
these two natural things some sort of an unnatural

19:31.169 --> 19:33.850
happening is taking place?

19:33.850 --> 19:40.860
But it is happening and these confusions only
make it possible for me to say that, in this

19:40.860 --> 19:49.049
confusion only, man is doubting today, “Is
this the meaning of our lives?

19:49.049 --> 19:50.320
Is it what we are seeking?”

19:50.320 --> 19:57.429
We have to be honest about it.

19:57.429 --> 20:06.980
If this doubt is there then maybe the Divine
Power can work it out I am sure.

20:06.980 --> 20:11.660
But they don’t want to listen about it,
they don’t want to know about it, they are

20:11.660 --> 20:13.710
not bothered about it.

20:13.710 --> 20:18.529
They are going the way they have been going,
they are very happy.

20:18.529 --> 20:23.130
They say, “We are not seekers.”

20:23.130 --> 20:26.029
What does that mean that they are not seekers?

20:26.029 --> 20:27.820
Are they satisfied with themselves?

20:27.820 --> 20:32.980
Do we like the way we live?

20:32.980 --> 20:39.649
But this freedom is not available, is not
available.

20:39.649 --> 20:47.269
If you like the way you live, you may have
cancer, who knows.

20:47.269 --> 20:50.379
You may have any disease.

20:50.379 --> 20:53.730
You may get mental problems.

20:53.730 --> 21:02.770
If not, your wife may divorce you, your children
may leave you.

21:02.770 --> 21:06.639
I mean there are immediate problems which
you may face, you do not know what’s happening

21:06.639 --> 21:08.289
today and what’s going to happen tomorrow.

21:08.289 --> 21:14.970
For example, I know somebody who is a very
nice man and who is not a seeker and he openly

21:14.970 --> 21:16.799
told me, very nicely.

21:16.799 --> 21:18.179
No seeker, alright.

21:18.179 --> 21:20.470
We don’t discuss religion, alright.

21:20.470 --> 21:24.799
And his wife ran away.

21:24.799 --> 21:28.919
So he comes back on God, “Why God is doing
such things?”

21:28.919 --> 21:36.360
I mean, “What have I done that God should
punish me like this?”

21:36.360 --> 21:39.380
On what level are you just now?

21:39.380 --> 21:46.480
You are just thinking of leading a very mundane,
ordinary life, but you cannot.

21:46.480 --> 21:50.330
This freedom is not available under the circumstances.

21:50.330 --> 22:03.040
It’s a time when there is an emergency,
tremendous emergency, in the atmosphere, which

22:03.040 --> 22:04.040
we must understand.

22:04.040 --> 22:09.190
When we talk of the society, the decadent
society, “this is happening,” what is

22:09.190 --> 22:10.190
it?

22:10.190 --> 22:18.250
It means that you are placed in a way, as
if there is [a] plague, and you have to be

22:18.250 --> 22:28.080
careful about it, to find out ways and methods,
the escape of it; where to get it.

22:28.080 --> 22:34.190
You cannot carry on with your mundane type
of life even if you want to because the problems

22:34.190 --> 22:42.241
that are around you, in front of you, at the
back of you, are so many that they will definitely

22:42.241 --> 22:49.580
take charge of you if you do not become your
Spirit.

22:49.580 --> 22:50.840
It is like that.

22:50.840 --> 23:01.499
If they don’t want to hear, alright, but
they must know that there is God’s grace

23:01.499 --> 23:03.230
on this Earth.

23:03.230 --> 23:10.409
My Grandson who was only at that time four
years of age – I don’t know how he knows

23:10.409 --> 23:15.340
so many Sanskrit words – he came to me [and
said] that, “It’s most surprising that

23:15.340 --> 23:19.210
people don’t know that there is God’s
grace working out everything.”

23:19.210 --> 23:21.230
He has told me.

23:21.230 --> 23:22.600
In Sanskrit it is ‘anukampa’.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.919
That, “God’s anukampa is there, they don’t
know.

23:24.919 --> 23:29.059
What do you say to this?

23:29.059 --> 23:30.509
They don’t know.”

23:30.509 --> 23:37.080
He’s a Realised-soul, he’s a born Realised-soul,
no doubt.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.159
But still [he’s] a little child, you know.

23:38.159 --> 23:40.760
He said, “They don’t know.”

23:40.760 --> 23:44.770
And he had that compassion, “Because they
don’t know they are punished.”

23:44.770 --> 23:51.460
He had that sort of a feeling that, “They
are blind and that’s why they are punished.

23:51.460 --> 23:53.250
They don’t know.”

23:53.250 --> 24:01.230
But he doesn’t know that they don’t want
to know also.

24:01.230 --> 24:10.999
And why they don’t want to know is the second
enquiry we should come up to.

24:10.999 --> 24:15.330
The other day we had dinner with some very
big leaders of your country.

24:15.330 --> 24:19.389
Labour leaders and Conservative leaders and
all that.

24:19.389 --> 24:23.330
And I was surprised that they were amazed
when I told them that I am a happy person.

24:23.330 --> 24:25.419
They said, “We are not.

24:25.419 --> 24:26.419
How can you be happy?”

24:26.419 --> 24:31.200
I said, “I am not only happy but I live
in joy.”

24:31.200 --> 24:33.010
They said, “How can that be?

24:33.010 --> 24:34.480
We don’t know what joy is.”

24:34.480 --> 24:38.489
So I said, “Would you like to know?”

24:38.489 --> 24:45.799
They said, “No!” (laughter) They also
told me, “In this country we don’t discuss

24:45.799 --> 24:46.799
religion.”

24:46.799 --> 24:47.799
I said, “It’s no question of religion.

24:47.799 --> 24:50.269
I am just talking about joy.”

24:50.269 --> 24:51.980
“No!”

24:51.980 --> 24:59.789
And what they were discussing among themselves,
I must say, was something, I mean I don’t

24:59.789 --> 25:05.549
know how to and intelligent man this gossip
business and this and that…All sorts of

25:05.549 --> 25:12.179
things they were discussing which had no relationship
to their status or to their position in life

25:12.179 --> 25:14.460
or to anything whatsoever.

25:14.460 --> 25:17.669
I was wondering, “How are these great people?”

25:17.669 --> 25:22.149
When you reach near them you find they are
so small, so mundane.

25:22.149 --> 25:28.360
There’s no subtlety in them.

25:28.360 --> 25:42.090
They don’t want to know about it perhaps
because they are frightened.

25:42.090 --> 25:49.879
They are frightened to know that there is
something higher than that.

25:49.879 --> 25:55.799
And this fear comes from ignorance, complete
ignorance.

25:55.799 --> 26:04.360
Because that is the area of full joy, complete
bliss and peace.

26:04.360 --> 26:15.210
All the nations have to rise to that so that
there’s no fear, there’s no war.

26:15.210 --> 26:19.720
The war is because we are not integrated people.

26:19.720 --> 26:23.749
Individually we are not integrated.

26:23.749 --> 26:28.340
Like we’ll eat the food which doesn’t
suit our body, we’ll desire for something

26:28.340 --> 26:30.759
which doesn’t suit our mind.

26:30.759 --> 26:32.700
We are so disintegrated.

26:32.700 --> 26:37.429
We live in seven personalities, fight with
each other.

26:37.429 --> 26:43.700
And when these seven personalities get together
we have collective fighting going on.

26:43.700 --> 26:55.629
So, the confusion comes from within and from
without and in this confusion only, I think

26:55.629 --> 26:59.559
human beings must seek.

26:59.559 --> 27:04.279
Now the stage has come where I have to tell
people, “Please seek!

27:04.279 --> 27:07.409
For heaven’s sake seek God!”

27:07.409 --> 27:11.090
Christ has said that, but people don’t understand.

27:11.090 --> 27:17.230
They’ll stand on the pulpit and read out
that Christ has said you must seek and you

27:17.230 --> 27:21.580
have to have your second birth.

27:21.580 --> 27:28.090
After that a big lecture follows – finished!

27:28.090 --> 27:34.299
These things are of very vital importance
today.

27:34.299 --> 27:39.590
If they are neglected nations after nations
will be destroyed.

27:39.590 --> 27:41.389
Nations after nations.

27:41.389 --> 27:44.309
It’s definite.

27:44.309 --> 27:48.119
The time is so short that’s why Realisation
has to be quick.

27:48.119 --> 27:50.039
We cannot postpone it [until] tomorrow.

27:50.039 --> 27:51.330
I can do the same trick.

27:51.330 --> 27:57.009
Christina wrote to me, “Mother, we should
never give realisation on the first [day].

27:57.009 --> 27:59.809
If you give on the first day they’ll never
turn up second day.

27:59.809 --> 28:03.880
You tell them, ‘Today is very difficult.’

28:03.880 --> 28:09.140
Then next day you just raise Kundalini up
to one chakra and keep it hanging there.

28:09.140 --> 28:15.549
Keep them hanging, never give them Realisation.

28:15.549 --> 28:20.360
Then reach the last stage when you are sure
that they are the seekers.

28:20.360 --> 28:24.820
Otherwise it is like throwing pearls before
the swines.”

28:24.820 --> 28:26.009
This exactly she has written to me.

28:26.009 --> 28:33.890
Of course I can’t do it because I see the
emergency, I see what’s going to happen.

28:33.890 --> 28:38.779
So many will be thrown away from the grace
of God.

28:38.779 --> 28:41.950
So we have to work it out.

28:41.950 --> 28:56.109
Because those today who are refusing will
come to me I know at a very later stage when

28:56.109 --> 28:57.190
it will not work out.

28:57.190 --> 29:05.379
The clicking of the mass Realisation will
only work out if the seeking on your part

29:05.379 --> 29:11.139
is also of that magnitude.

29:11.139 --> 29:23.240
Otherwise, if there is a light and [it’s]
kept under the table, how can it spread?

29:23.240 --> 29:28.369
You have to be prepared to get the masses.

29:28.369 --> 29:30.350
But how?

29:30.350 --> 29:33.909
Is the problem.

29:33.909 --> 29:41.259
The people in charge of all communications
on this worldly life, I don’t know what

29:41.259 --> 29:42.559
they are seeking.

29:42.559 --> 29:48.149
They discuss all other nonsensical things
but they don’t want to talk about Sahaj

29:48.149 --> 29:49.429
Yog.

29:49.429 --> 29:59.020
And the whole problem with me is [that] I
can’t understand human beings on that level.

29:59.020 --> 30:02.220
I just can’t understand.

30:02.220 --> 30:06.730
How can they postpone it when they know it
is evident, it is coming?

30:06.730 --> 30:12.580
It’s going to work out on them and they
are going to face the greatest difficulties,

30:12.580 --> 30:14.100
very soon.

30:14.100 --> 30:23.030
It’s going to work out through their children,
through their families, through societies,

30:23.030 --> 30:26.890
through nations.

30:26.890 --> 30:39.159
And this universal understanding has to become
a collective understanding, then only, what

30:39.159 --> 30:44.220
the Divine Power is doing on its part will
work out.

30:44.220 --> 30:45.220
Otherwise it is useless.

30:45.220 --> 30:47.230
You cannot blame God for that.

30:47.230 --> 30:50.690
It’s nice to blame God for everything.

30:50.690 --> 30:57.259
What about thinking about yourselves [and]
what you are up to?

30:57.259 --> 31:01.889
It’s true Kundalini awakening is a very
difficult thing.

31:01.889 --> 31:08.539
It’s not easy to awaken the Kundalini, no
doubt.

31:08.539 --> 31:16.109
One had to work for days together, for years
together, they said even lives together.

31:16.109 --> 31:34.979
They had to go on cleansing themselves and
then clearing out themselves for years and

31:34.979 --> 31:41.559
years and years and then the guru would raise
your Kundalini.

31:41.559 --> 31:43.440
It’s a fact.

31:43.440 --> 31:54.429
But today the emergency has come and the Divine
Power understands that this emergency is there.

31:54.429 --> 32:00.789
People have to get Realisation.

32:00.789 --> 32:07.700
That is how you are placed, in a very precarious
way.

32:07.700 --> 32:14.899
I do not know when people in charge of human
beings will realise.

32:14.899 --> 32:21.559
They are supposed to be in charge, but up
to what point?

32:21.559 --> 32:26.690
Up to what point?

32:26.690 --> 32:36.479
They have to realise that, if they do not
accept their evolution, all those who are

32:36.479 --> 32:45.590
following them up and thinking them to be
their leaders and ideals are blocked by their

32:45.590 --> 32:48.330
nonsensical lives that they are leading.

32:48.330 --> 32:56.929
But it’s hard because, as it is, to be leaders
means that you must have big egos.

32:56.929 --> 32:59.860
And they don’t think that there is anything
like God also.

32:59.860 --> 33:04.619
Just they use God because by that they can
impress people.

33:04.619 --> 33:09.889
But there is no real understanding about God’s
ways.

33:09.889 --> 33:17.740
As it is Sahaja Yoga is doing a lot of work
in this country.

33:17.740 --> 33:19.509
I can see that.

33:19.509 --> 33:23.429
And the people I have got are really beautiful
people.

33:23.429 --> 33:25.489
They have become dynamic now.

33:25.489 --> 33:28.129
They are wonderful.

33:28.129 --> 33:34.549
But I must say we are very few compared to
the population of this place and compared

33:34.549 --> 33:38.080
to the importance of England, which is the
heart of the universe.

33:38.080 --> 33:45.520
We have to have many more and not only that
but we have to have much deeper Sahaja Yogis

33:45.520 --> 33:56.119
who will go deep into themselves and would
spread out and get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

33:56.119 --> 34:00.010
I don’t want to talk about Kundalini again.

34:00.010 --> 34:02.519
Every time I have been repeating about it.

34:02.519 --> 34:06.059
You’ve got the books, you can see the new
people who have come.

34:06.059 --> 34:12.309
Today I think there are very few new people
but those who are there should come in front,

34:12.309 --> 34:15.200
without any fears or reservation.

34:15.200 --> 34:18.500
One should not feel bad if we say, “You
come forward.”

34:18.500 --> 34:21.559
There is no show going on here.

34:21.559 --> 34:27.579
If you have come here for your Realisation
you must come forward and get your Realisation.

34:27.579 --> 34:30.559
It’s not another kind of a lecture that
is going on.

34:30.559 --> 34:38.280
We do not ask you to pay any money or anything,
because you are deserving cases, because you

34:38.280 --> 34:40.599
want your Realisation.

34:40.599 --> 34:43.799
Like sensible people you must get your Realisation.

34:43.799 --> 34:47.250
Now you may say that, “We have come just
to see and we have gone away.”

34:47.250 --> 34:49.730
This is an ego-trip I personally think.

34:49.730 --> 34:52.119
There’s no spying going on here.

34:52.119 --> 34:53.599
Have you come to spy here?

34:53.599 --> 34:54.770
Or why have you come?

34:54.770 --> 34:55.929
Are you from the newspaper?

34:55.929 --> 34:58.329
We have nothing to do with newspapers either.

34:58.329 --> 35:03.250
If you have come for your Realisation you
should come and get it.

35:03.250 --> 35:04.830
It’s a simple thing.

35:04.830 --> 35:10.289
If you just want to sit here you disturb the
vibrations of other people; you do not know

35:10.289 --> 35:11.289
that.

35:11.289 --> 35:18.740
A person who doesn’t want Realisation is
no good for us and is troublesome and it irritates

35:18.740 --> 35:23.329
the good vibrations that are here.

35:23.329 --> 35:26.030
The Deities don’t like that.

35:26.030 --> 35:29.580
So I would request you not to feel afraid
of it.

35:29.580 --> 35:31.160
There’s nothing to be afraid.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.630
There’s nothing to be angry.

35:33.630 --> 35:36.840
And don’t get into any ego-trips.

35:36.840 --> 35:37.970
Just get your Realisation.

35:37.970 --> 35:42.619
That is very important: for which you cannot
pay.

35:42.619 --> 35:47.930
But that doesn’t give you a right to assert
yourself the way you want to be.

35:47.930 --> 35:56.210
You have to little bit understand that this
is a place, not Caxton Hall, but is a temple,

35:56.210 --> 35:58.250
where you have to get the blessings.

35:58.250 --> 36:03.349
If you don’t want to have it it’s an insult,
so you better go.

36:03.349 --> 36:07.700
If you are here for not having it, it’s
better not to come.

36:07.700 --> 36:10.380
It’s better not to insult.

36:10.380 --> 36:14.650
At least you should be so kind as not to insult.

36:14.650 --> 36:21.900
There is a way, of course, of telling people,
because you must know that people don’t

36:21.900 --> 36:24.230
like it if you tell them like that.

36:24.230 --> 36:28.020
But you have come here for your Realisation
and for nothing else.

36:28.020 --> 36:44.020
It is my ardent desire, has been that the
whole of this country should become Realised.

36:44.020 --> 36:48.710
Because I think it is one of the leading countries.

36:48.710 --> 36:51.380
It can change lots of things.

36:51.380 --> 36:55.240
But it is too much to expect, I believe, now.

36:55.240 --> 36:57.480
I have spent eight years.

36:57.480 --> 37:02.789
And from my experience I feel that this country
has lost it’s moorings.

37:02.789 --> 37:05.040
It has lost it’s depth.

37:05.040 --> 37:09.660
It runs after things which are very superficial.

37:09.660 --> 37:18.640
They were known for their scholarship, for
going into the details of the things, for

37:18.640 --> 37:21.560
finding out about rights and wrongs.

37:21.560 --> 37:29.190
And today I find the whole thing has become
nothing but a matter of discussion and talking

37:29.190 --> 37:31.510
and showing off.

37:31.510 --> 37:35.260
There is no heart in it.

37:35.260 --> 37:43.869
This is the heart and if the heart fails the
whole universe is going to suffer.

37:43.869 --> 37:49.790
To work it out we have tried everything.

37:49.790 --> 37:51.090
Whatever people have said I have accepted.

37:51.090 --> 37:54.819
If they have said, “Mother, you have to
advertise,” I said, “Advertise, do what

37:54.819 --> 37:57.883
you like, the way you want to do it you can
do it.”

37:57.883 --> 38:08.670
We have tried everything but also, as I said,
it can go to an extent; it has its own maryadas,

38:08.670 --> 38:11.809
its own boundaries, then it recedes.

38:11.809 --> 38:16.869
If you have any questions please ask me.

38:16.869 --> 38:34.410
Today I’m in a preparation mood because
if you know there’s a big event coming and

38:34.410 --> 38:37.280
that was such a big event on this Earth.

38:37.280 --> 38:53.610
I don’t know how people have forgotten everything
and just, the crucifixion has become a symbol

38:53.610 --> 38:55.720
of showing off.

38:55.720 --> 38:58.990
It’s very sad.

38:58.990 --> 39:04.460
It’s a very sad thing.

39:04.460 --> 39:13.609
If you have any questions please ask me.

39:13.609 --> 39:24.260
Ask some questions.

39:24.260 --> 39:29.780
Seeker: (inaudible)

39:29.780 --> 39:46.339
Shri Mataji: Did you hear him?

39:46.339 --> 40:00.130
Come here, please, come forward.

40:00.130 --> 40:05.650
Seeker: (inaudible)

40:05.650 --> 40:16.690
Shri Mataji: No, no.

40:16.690 --> 40:23.279
You see, I know the question.

40:23.279 --> 40:25.990
You sit down, I’ll tell you.

40:25.990 --> 40:32.570
This question has been asked many a times,
that: “Once you feel the cool breeze are

40:32.570 --> 40:36.380
you a Realised-soul?”

40:36.380 --> 40:42.700
Once you are born as a human being you are
human being, isn’t it?

40:42.700 --> 40:45.830
Then you don’t become an animal.

40:45.830 --> 40:50.170
But you can, if you again go on living with
other animals, you can.

40:50.170 --> 41:00.500
Supposing a human being becomes friendly with
monkeys, he’ll start behaving like monkeys.

41:00.500 --> 41:07.520
But if he lives with human beings and develops
himself and matures himself then he becomes

41:07.520 --> 41:12.020
a good, matured human being.

41:12.020 --> 41:19.549
For a human being to be alright he has to
learn the ways and methods of the sustenance

41:19.549 --> 41:22.050
of his human qualities.

41:22.050 --> 41:28.930
Every human being who walks about is not a
human being according to me.

41:28.930 --> 41:32.069
Some of them are monkeys, some of the are
donkeys.

41:32.069 --> 41:37.920
Yes, to me they look like that, without their
outer appearances, the way they talk, the

41:37.920 --> 41:40.060
way they behave, the way they are.

41:40.060 --> 41:42.570
And some of them are like jackals and things
like that.

41:42.570 --> 41:55.150
Some are so aggressive and some are so secretive
just like scorpions and like other animals

41:55.150 --> 41:58.900
which just crawl up; from some hole they’ll
appear.

41:58.900 --> 42:04.869
You see, all these things are so dominantly
there that, though they have got the human

42:04.869 --> 42:10.690
form, that [their] past is so dominantly there
that you see nothing but a snake coming out

42:10.690 --> 42:15.309
from somewhere and just hissing at you.

42:15.309 --> 42:18.599
So when you touch it, what do you touch?

42:18.599 --> 42:21.599
You touch this Divine Power which is surrounding
you.

42:21.599 --> 42:23.500
That is the cool breeze you are feeling.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.609
Just you have touched it now.

42:25.609 --> 42:32.140
But your past is so great and you are identified
with so many other things.

42:32.140 --> 42:38.720
And there are so many other problems with
you that you have to come out of it completely.

42:38.720 --> 42:44.289
Like, as I have said, the egg has to become
the bird.

42:44.289 --> 42:55.200
Now once the egg is broken, it must be a bird
inside otherwise it won’t break, but the

42:55.200 --> 43:03.289
bird has to come out of the egg fully, otherwise
it’s stuck with all the things that are

43:03.289 --> 43:04.720
in the egg.

43:04.720 --> 43:13.240
So some of the Sahaja Yogis have been who
just came out and flew, spread their wings

43:13.240 --> 43:14.240
beautifully.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.960
I have seen that.

43:16.960 --> 43:23.020
But some are still sticking on because some
of them think that Sahaja Yoga is here to

43:23.020 --> 43:29.630
solve their physical problems or their family
problems or their somebody’s problems.

43:29.630 --> 43:32.310
You see, they are stuck up!

43:32.310 --> 43:36.960
I have seen people will bring all the family
people who are suffering from cancer if I

43:36.960 --> 43:45.810
cure one cancer patient; I mean, [if] a cancer
is cured automatically, supposing, of somebody.

43:45.810 --> 43:51.400
Then he goes and brings…there was in Poona,
I gave Realisation to one fellow and his angina

43:51.400 --> 43:54.670
was cured and the doctor said, “You are
completely cured!”

43:54.670 --> 43:58.799
So he got at least twelve people who were
suffering from all kinds of diseases.

43:58.799 --> 44:01.940
Imagine, he had only twelve patients around.

44:01.940 --> 44:05.520
Otherwise he would have taken me to the hospital.

44:05.520 --> 44:15.480
And then, naturally, he loses his vibrations
because that’s not the way [to progress].

44:15.480 --> 44:22.211
You are just coming up, you have just touched
outside, you are just out of the water, just

44:22.211 --> 44:26.950
breathed once, but that is what is Self-realisation.

44:26.950 --> 44:31.549
It’s not self-recognition as yet, it’s
only Self-realisation.

44:31.549 --> 44:38.000
But recognition starts when you start understanding
what this power is, how far you can go with

44:38.000 --> 44:41.660
it, what you can do it, how many people you
can give Realisation to.

44:41.660 --> 44:46.150
[Only] then you become a Sahaja Yogi, you
are not a Sahaja Yogi [before that].

44:46.150 --> 44:50.920
I have known some people who are born Self-realised,
good for nothing, absolutely useless people.

44:50.920 --> 44:57.610
They feel my vibrations, just as soon as they
enter the room they’ll feel my vibrations

44:57.610 --> 44:58.610
– so what?

44:58.610 --> 45:01.600
They are thoroughly useless people.

45:01.600 --> 45:05.790
Now we have decided not to tell anyone that
they are born-realised because their heads

45:05.790 --> 45:06.900
go off.

45:06.900 --> 45:08.569
Can you imagine?

45:08.569 --> 45:12.760
Even Self-realised people have this problem
of ego.

45:12.760 --> 45:13.839
You have to outgrow.

45:13.839 --> 45:21.109
It’s just the connection [that] is established
with the Self.

45:21.109 --> 45:25.039
But still the connection is so weak.

45:25.039 --> 45:27.680
Alright?

45:27.680 --> 45:28.680
That is what it is.

45:28.680 --> 45:30.910
You have to grow.

45:30.910 --> 45:44.840
But even touching that connection, itself,
was a very difficult thing.

45:44.840 --> 45:50.339
But because it was difficult, people used
to stick onto it.

45:50.339 --> 45:56.579
Because it is easy today they just take it
for granted.

45:56.579 --> 46:01.839
But one has to do it fast, that’s all – I
can’t help it.

46:01.839 --> 46:05.010
I know it has a reaction.

46:05.010 --> 46:16.769
But I have known people who got Realisation,
they just said, “That’s it!”

46:16.769 --> 46:17.769
– Finished!

46:17.769 --> 46:24.339
It’s like you are standing in the water
and there are waves and you are frightened

46:24.339 --> 46:33.079
of the waves but somebody is dragging you
onto a boat, you are not in the boat yet,

46:33.079 --> 46:35.549
you have touched the boat, you are just coming
up.

46:35.549 --> 46:40.260
But you want to live with the crocodile as
well.

46:40.260 --> 46:41.950
So the thing is going on.

46:41.950 --> 46:48.079
One foot in the crocodile’s mouth and one
hand on the boat.

46:48.079 --> 46:53.110
But some just jump into it and then they see
the waves, and they are not bothered, “These

46:53.110 --> 46:55.900
are waves, after all we are in the boat!”

46:55.900 --> 46:57.569
Alright?

46:57.569 --> 47:01.990
So it depends on the quality of a seeker,
very much.

47:01.990 --> 47:04.920
Because the quality is now to be improved,
after Self-realisation.

47:04.920 --> 47:09.099
It doesn’t matter: whatever is the quality
you shouldn’t mind.

47:09.099 --> 47:13.029
Whatever is the quality can be improved.

47:13.029 --> 47:14.490
No problem!

47:14.490 --> 47:15.490
Alright?

47:15.490 --> 47:18.130
May God bless you.

47:18.130 --> 47:21.180
Are you alright now or not?

47:21.180 --> 47:25.780
So you give up all your personal problems.

47:25.780 --> 47:30.460
Forget about them.

47:30.460 --> 47:39.420
You are so much shocked because you have come
from and Indian family, but these problems

47:39.420 --> 47:41.369
will never shock English people.

47:41.369 --> 47:45.910
Because it’s very common and mundane.

47:45.910 --> 47:49.170
You come home and you find your wife is disappeared.

47:49.170 --> 47:53.160
It’s very common, nothing wrong in it (according
to them).

47:53.160 --> 47:55.299
You see you are free to do what you like.

47:55.299 --> 48:01.190
So you should not be so much shocked about
it and worried about anything like that.

48:01.190 --> 48:03.040
Alright?

48:03.040 --> 48:09.809
If you have come to this country you must
know [that] you have to pay for it!

48:09.809 --> 48:13.440
(laughing) Isn’t it?

48:13.440 --> 48:17.520
I mean, you may gain something in money but
you may lose your wife or someone, can’t

48:17.520 --> 48:18.520
say.

48:18.520 --> 48:19.520
Yes, that’s very true.

48:19.520 --> 48:22.819
You see you have to.

48:22.819 --> 48:25.640
It’s very difficult.

48:25.640 --> 48:28.460
It’s very difficult.

48:28.460 --> 48:36.700
You can’t trust anyone in this respect here.

48:36.700 --> 48:42.950
Suddenly you will find you neighbour walking
into your room and settling down there as

48:42.950 --> 48:44.570
the husband of your wife.

48:44.570 --> 48:47.100
It’s quite possible.

48:47.100 --> 48:50.010
So this is what it is and one should not be
shocked about it now.

48:50.010 --> 48:51.530
I have reached that conclusion now.

48:51.530 --> 48:54.960
I tell all the Indians from abroad not to
have any cultural shocks.

48:54.960 --> 48:59.589
They should be quite prepared for it or they
should not stay here – finished.

48:59.589 --> 49:05.589
We have other shocks and they have other types
of shocks, you see.

49:05.589 --> 49:14.180
So, to get out of all these things, one has
to know that, by coming to England, you have

49:14.180 --> 49:18.660
gained your Realisation, and get to it.

49:18.660 --> 49:19.660
That’s the main thing.

49:19.660 --> 49:22.910
Is that the most important thing for you?

49:22.910 --> 49:26.760
Is it?

49:26.760 --> 49:30.109
If it is the most important thing then you
have got it.

49:30.109 --> 49:32.720
But you should make it the most important
also.

49:32.720 --> 49:33.720
Alright?

49:33.720 --> 49:40.650
That’s how it is going to work out: make
it as the most important thing, then you will

49:40.650 --> 49:42.460
be in joy.

49:42.460 --> 49:44.369
And you must spend it.

49:44.369 --> 49:52.039
If you have got your Self-realisation you
have to give Realisation to others, isn’t

49:52.039 --> 49:53.220
it?

49:53.220 --> 49:57.950
And it’s so nice that Indians get it so
fast.

49:57.950 --> 50:00.589
That’s also a great thing.

50:00.589 --> 50:07.510
You should be thankful that you get it so
fast compared to others.

50:07.510 --> 50:08.510
Alright?

50:08.510 --> 50:12.289
May God bless you.

50:12.289 --> 50:24.730
Now what else is the question?

50:24.730 --> 50:29.710
You see it’s a very complicated life here,
one must understand, and in this complication

50:29.710 --> 50:32.160
there are problems no doubt.

50:32.160 --> 50:36.650
That’s why the Realisation works like that.

50:36.650 --> 50:47.580
You see, it moves with a snails pace, where
it’s a jet age.

50:47.580 --> 50:49.260
Yes please?

50:49.260 --> 50:50.940
Seeker: (inaudible)

50:50.940 --> 50:53.460
Shri Mataji: Great.

50:53.460 --> 50:56.820
What a nice question.

50:56.820 --> 51:07.150
He wants to know the relationship between
the Self and the Divine Power of God.

51:07.150 --> 51:15.329
It’s such a nice question but requires at
least half an hour.

51:15.329 --> 51:34.059
Self is the reflection of God within us, which
is the Spirit, which resides in our heart,

51:34.059 --> 51:35.210
normally.

51:35.210 --> 51:53.680
And the Divine Power is the power of God which
is his love, which desires, activates, creates

51:53.680 --> 51:56.230
and evolves.

51:56.230 --> 52:20.860
It evolves human beings after creating them,
to such a point that they can feel this power

52:20.860 --> 52:24.550
through the connection of the Spirit.

52:24.550 --> 52:31.780
When you get connected to the Spirit then
only you can feel this power around you, before

52:31.780 --> 52:35.550
that you do not feel anything.

52:35.550 --> 52:44.839
Because the one that can feel this power is
your Spirit but the Spirit in the human consciousness

52:44.839 --> 52:54.180
is not conscious [this] means you cannot feel
it on your central nervous system.

52:54.180 --> 53:02.250
But once you are Realised it starts acting
in your central nervous system and that’s

53:02.250 --> 53:06.569
why you can feel it all around you.

53:06.569 --> 53:07.569
Alright?

53:07.569 --> 53:12.849
I made it (the answer) rather short but in
one of my lectures of Creation you might be

53:12.849 --> 53:21.730
able to understand it better.

53:21.730 --> 53:27.069
May God bless.

53:27.069 --> 53:31.970
You see they say that there is All-pervading
Power, everybody says that, isn’t it, in

53:31.970 --> 53:32.970
every scripture.

53:32.970 --> 53:34.530
But how do you know?

53:34.530 --> 53:38.520
In Vedas they have said about Bharga, they
have talked about Bhargo.

53:38.520 --> 53:43.640
So you can imagine, even that time they knew
there is Divine Power around us.

53:43.640 --> 53:45.119
But how can you see it?

53:45.119 --> 53:49.650
How can you feel it?

53:49.650 --> 53:53.619
That means human level is not sufficient.

53:53.619 --> 53:59.900
You have to rise up to a certain higher level
and that level is where you become the Spirit

53:59.900 --> 54:02.080
and Spirit is the Collective Being within
you.

54:02.080 --> 54:05.910
That’s the collective, that’s the connecting
line.

54:05.910 --> 54:11.170
I cannot give any example because it’s such
an absolute thing.

54:11.170 --> 54:13.690
It cannot be relative.

54:13.690 --> 54:18.730
But something that exists within you which
is collectively connected, part of the collective,

54:18.730 --> 54:21.170
which is conscious of it’s collectivity.

54:21.170 --> 54:27.630
And once you get connected you get collectively
conscious, not only that but your central

54:27.630 --> 54:36.869
nervous system gets activated [this] means
it has a greater dimension in itself and you

54:36.869 --> 54:39.650
start feeling the All-pervading Power.

54:39.650 --> 54:45.190
You can start feeling the vibrations of another
person.

54:45.190 --> 54:51.000
You can see in that person where is the problem
and you can see in yourself where is the problem

54:51.000 --> 54:52.779
by feeling it on your fingers.

54:52.779 --> 54:54.869
This should happen to you.

54:54.869 --> 55:00.569
If this does not happen to you all other things
are useless.

55:00.569 --> 55:08.410
This is what it is, what Christ has said,
what everybody has said, and if it is not

55:08.410 --> 55:11.420
happening [there’s] no use going to church
on every Sunday.

55:11.420 --> 55:15.670
No use, it’s just a waste of time.

55:15.670 --> 55:24.720
No use ringing the bells or singing the praise
of God or anything – it’s all useless.

55:24.720 --> 55:31.089
If you cannot get to that, that means the
ladders are wrong, you are climbing the wrong

55:31.089 --> 55:34.619
ladders.

55:34.619 --> 55:38.150
Alright?

55:38.150 --> 55:50.940
So any other question from Sahaja Yogis will
be a good idea.

55:50.940 --> 55:52.130
(Break in audio.

55:52.130 --> 55:53.130
Yogi probably asks question about family and
giving Realisation to them but it’s not

55:53.130 --> 55:54.130
on the audio.)

55:54.130 --> 55:57.730
Shri Mataji: Now you see, you have to Decide
like this: if he’s not – give him up.

55:57.730 --> 56:03.029
Because he’s your family so it’s an accident
[that he got Realisation].

56:03.029 --> 56:04.349
Just forget it!

56:04.349 --> 56:07.160
Don’t waste your energies with these people.

56:07.160 --> 56:11.119
Christ has said clearly, “Don’t throw
pearls before some people.”

56:11.119 --> 56:12.119
Alright?

56:12.119 --> 56:13.119
So that’s what it is.

56:13.119 --> 56:20.210
If he is a seeker then it’s a different
point.

56:20.210 --> 56:24.829
No use breaking your head against a wall.

56:24.829 --> 56:36.160
But if he is a seeker, alright, then you can
work it out in your own ways, if you know

56:36.160 --> 56:38.390
about Sahaja Yoga, how to work it out.

56:38.390 --> 56:39.829
A seeker may be alright.

56:39.829 --> 56:44.990
I mean, we have had such experiences of family
people, very absurd, you know.

56:44.990 --> 56:48.190
You just don’t know.

56:48.190 --> 56:55.859
There was a gentleman who came to see me who
was the father of one of the Sahaja Yogis.

56:55.859 --> 56:57.670
I gave him Realisation.

56:57.670 --> 57:05.760
And he is a drunkard, and he gave up his drinking
for some time, but his wife said, “What

57:05.760 --> 57:06.769
is this?

57:06.769 --> 57:08.230
This is not our culture!

57:08.230 --> 57:11.779
We have to have drinking otherwise how are
we to entertain people?” or whatever it

57:11.779 --> 57:12.779
is.

57:12.779 --> 57:14.859
He was again drawn into that society.

57:14.859 --> 57:18.710
So, just imagine, to say, “This is our culture!”
(laughing).

57:18.710 --> 57:20.330
Again drawn into the same society.

57:20.330 --> 57:22.160
And she’s a big Catholic!

57:22.160 --> 57:24.089
And she said, “You must confess your sins!”

57:24.089 --> 57:32.950
And one of the sins he must have confessed
[is] that he got his Realisation, I am sure!

57:32.950 --> 57:37.540
And then, so much so that he lost everything,
and he’s a drunkard now.

57:37.540 --> 57:38.980
He sleeps and gone.

57:38.980 --> 57:47.910
Now the son and the daughter who are great
Sahaja Yogis today, have given them up, finished!

57:47.910 --> 57:57.099
How far can you go with them?

57:57.099 --> 58:06.549
Do you see the point?

58:06.549 --> 58:17.240
So, under the circumstances, one should find
out if he is a seeker.

58:17.240 --> 58:20.859
If he is not a seeker, no use talking to him
about anything whatsoever.

58:20.859 --> 58:22.359
It’s a waste.

58:22.359 --> 58:27.049
I tell you it’s a waste.

58:27.049 --> 58:33.730
But I have seen [that] non-seekers are very
much attracted towards people who have superficial

58:33.730 --> 58:36.440
things and they have a pompous show and things.

58:36.440 --> 58:38.829
They are very much attracted.

58:38.829 --> 58:46.769
And they will ruin their lives like that.

58:46.769 --> 58:48.470
And how far can you go with them?

58:48.470 --> 58:50.660
I mean, you should try but what can you do?

58:50.660 --> 58:55.839
Like, another Sahaja Yogini, she had a son
who became like a criminal personality.

58:55.839 --> 58:59.030
Then she said, “Mother, how to give him
Realisation?”

58:59.030 --> 59:00.030
I said, “No forget it!

59:00.030 --> 59:03.059
Now if the police is arresting him, what can
you do?

59:03.059 --> 59:06.109
Give up!”

59:06.109 --> 59:10.500
That I said, that, you can go up to a point,
up to an extent, but beyond that you cannot

59:10.500 --> 59:13.491
force people to be Realised, you cannot.

59:13.491 --> 59:17.390
They have to get it themselves, they have
to ask for it.

59:17.390 --> 59:21.000
There’s a protocol of the Divine Power.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.789
You cannot fall at their feet.

59:22.789 --> 59:25.920
After all, for what?

59:25.920 --> 59:28.430
It is for their gain, not for our gain.

59:28.430 --> 59:31.230
We don’t take any money, nothing of the
kind.

59:31.230 --> 59:33.619
We are doing it for their gain.

59:33.619 --> 59:35.960
They should ask for it, isn’t it.

59:35.960 --> 59:40.470
Or should we fall at their feet, “Take your
Realisation!

59:40.470 --> 59:42.910
Take your Realisation!”

59:42.910 --> 59:45.349
Is it expected?

59:45.349 --> 59:48.710
That’s going too far.

59:48.710 --> 59:53.220
So forget about such people who do not care
for Realisation.

59:53.220 --> 59:54.220
Forget it!

59:54.220 --> 59:57.849
If you think you can bring them round, well
and good, otherwise don’t go too far otherwise

59:57.849 --> 01:00:01.609
you will lose your vibrations I can tell you.

01:00:01.609 --> 01:00:03.829
You will lose your Realisation.

01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:05.170
That happens.

01:00:05.170 --> 01:00:11.910
But I must say, Sahaja Yogis are very sensible.

01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:13.740
Any other question?

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:16.549
Are you still involved in your family so much?

01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:19.369
Are you still very much involved?

01:00:19.369 --> 01:00:24.600
Yogini: (inaudible)

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:32.029
Shri Mataji: Your husband?

01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:38.660
If it comes from a wife they’ll not have
it.

01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:41.279
That’s another point about men.

01:00:41.279 --> 01:00:44.280
You better try it through some other Sahaja
Yogis.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:48.250
You see, men are such that, if it comes from
the wife they may not have it.

01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:51.910
Yes, it’s true.

01:00:51.910 --> 01:01:03.150
So better try some other Sahaja Yogis to talk
to him.

01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:08.509
If he is a seeker you should try, otherwise
forget it.

01:01:08.509 --> 01:01:16.069
When you were married you were not a Realised-soul
so it’s alright.

01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:25.859
If you believe in many lives, how many times
you must have been married before also?

01:01:25.859 --> 01:01:28.289
(laughing)

01:01:28.289 --> 01:01:38.310
Yes, any other question please?

01:01:38.310 --> 01:02:15.099
Gavin: Is there anything we can do to increase
the vibrations?

01:02:15.099 --> 01:02:35.609
Shri Mataji: Actually Gavin, I feel here everybody
is not a Sahaja Yogi, and this we should discuss

01:02:35.609 --> 01:02:43.900
separately because this will be another secret
working we’ll have to do.

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:50.930
So I think we’ll do it next time when I
meet you in the ashram.

01:02:50.930 --> 01:02:54.279
Will that be alright Gavin?

01:02:54.279 --> 01:02:58.170
Because what we can do, we can do a lot.

01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:03.309
I think you people can do a lot, no doubt,
and that’s how I had exactly in my mind

01:03:03.309 --> 01:03:10.950
to tell you but I just wanted to see.

01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:20.940
I feel today, it would be not very good because
the people who are here may be new and you

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:25.900
know how they get shocked if you tell them
anything like that.

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:32.740
Of course, nothing that you are going to do
that is any way wrong or anything, but they

01:03:32.740 --> 01:03:37.650
won’t understand, I mean to say.

01:03:37.650 --> 01:03:42.579
Our terminology is different from theirs and
they are absolutely new so they won’t understand

01:03:42.579 --> 01:03:47.499
our terminology when we say about bandhans
and this and that, so it’s better to discuss

01:03:47.499 --> 01:03:53.590
it amongst Sahaja Yogis only where one can
understand all the terminology, otherwise

01:03:53.590 --> 01:04:02.460
they’ll be quite shocked thinking that this
is another language we are speaking.

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:10.910
About the new people who have got Realisation
and have been here for more than three times

01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:17.369
should come to our programme on the seventh,
will be a good idea.

01:04:17.369 --> 01:04:24.849
Those new people who have got Realisation
and who have been to the programme three times

01:04:24.849 --> 01:04:33.960
should come to the new ashram on the seventh
of April.

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:36.490
I hope you know the address of the new ashram.

01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:37.700
Who are like that?

01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:43.630
People who are new and who have got Realisation.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:45.910
You touched your Realisation the other day.

01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:46.910
No?

01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:47.910
You did.

01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:52.250
And you have been coming to our programmes,
so you please come.

01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:53.250
Alright?

01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:54.250
Who else?

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:56.950
Yes please come, if you don’t mind.

01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:58.509
This gentleman has come today?

01:04:58.509 --> 01:05:02.460
Is he feeling the cool breeze?

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:03.809
Are you feeling the cool breeze.

01:05:03.809 --> 01:05:05.009
Seeker: Not yet.

01:05:05.009 --> 01:05:06.210
Shri Mataji: Alright.

01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:07.809
It will work out.

01:05:07.809 --> 01:05:10.910
And have you come for the first time today?

01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:11.910
Alright.

01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:13.560
Just put your hands towards me.

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:14.580
Just like this.

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:15.580
Let’s see.

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:16.580
Just like this.

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.579
You all have to feel the cool breeze.

01:05:18.579 --> 01:05:22.430
If you don’t feel the cool breeze then we
cannot talk about it.

01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:27.609
You have to feel the cool breeze, the All-pervading
Power.

01:05:27.609 --> 01:05:34.299
Unless and until that has happened we cannot
say we have touched it.

01:05:34.299 --> 01:05:37.400
But so many will not feel on the hand in the
beginning.

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:46.339
So we should see that it comes out of your
head, from the brahmarandhra, is the fontanelle

01:05:46.339 --> 01:05:48.359
bone area.

01:05:48.359 --> 01:05:53.150
If there is a cool breeze coming out of your
head from here then you should know that you

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:59.079
have touched it.

01:05:59.079 --> 01:06:07.140
Now please put both the hands towards me and
close your eyes.

01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:08.569
Just close your eyes.

01:06:08.569 --> 01:06:17.700
Put both the hands towards me and both the
feet on the ground, touching the ground.

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:29.319
Just put your, both, the hands.

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:34.880
Just close your eyes.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:45.040
Come here, come, come here.

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.040
There’s a place here.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.040
Come along!

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:54.329
Him also, if he could come here, will be a
good idea.

01:06:54.329 --> 01:07:01.150
This gentleman at the end Gavin, he’s come
for the first time.

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:06.539
It’s better.

01:07:06.539 --> 01:07:12.680
Just put your hands like this and please close
your eyes.

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:15.519
Please close your eyes.

01:07:15.519 --> 01:07:17.890
Yes, please come forward, come forward.

01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:19.049
Will be a good idea.

01:07:19.049 --> 01:07:20.049
See?

01:07:20.049 --> 01:07:22.540
As we have to see that you get it.

01:07:22.540 --> 01:07:27.380
It is the becoming which is important, it’s
not just giving a lecture, you have to become.

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:32.079
If you do not become then it has no meaning.

01:07:32.079 --> 01:07:36.190
It’s the becoming that is important.

01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:37.190
Please.

01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:38.420
Please come.

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:39.900
It’s good.

01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:42.200
We have to see that you get it.

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:47.210
That’s our main interest and concern, nothing
else!

01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:55.160
Do come all of you please.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.160
Please come forward.

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.160
Very sweet.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.220
Come along, make yourself comfortable.

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:00.220
Come along.

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:05.079
Please come, there’s a seat here.

01:08:05.079 --> 01:08:11.630
Just join, here there’s a seat, come along.

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:13.270
Sit down.

01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:16.880
Put your both the hands.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:23.429
Close your eyes, close your eyes.

01:08:23.429 --> 01:08:28.889
Don’t keep your eyes open.
