00:08:53.168 --> 00:08:56.151
Shri Mataji: Oh you brought it all the way.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.580
Done the havan. The havan is done now? Let me see,

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.880
what is the situation.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.018
Put all the fruits and everything.

00:09:06.173 --> 00:09:09.173
Yogi: Oh, She’s taking her shoes off.

00:09:49.186 --> 00:09:51.380
Shri Mataji: Oh, be seated.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.186
Still the heaviness of the puja is there.

00:10:00.625 --> 00:10:02.625
Much clearer.

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:06.458
Be careful, be careful now.

00:10:09.082 --> 00:10:11.082
All right?

00:10:14.789 --> 00:10:17.989
So now we can leave at 1 o’clock from here?

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.191
Brian Bell: Best leave earlier Shri
Mataji. Shri Mataji: Little earlier. All right.

00:10:22.365 --> 00:10:26.025
Brian Bell: We should be on the way twenty to, to see the gardens.

00:10:26.725 --> 00:10:30.049
Shri Mataji: So the luggage and all that can be sent ahead I think.

00:10:30.615 --> 00:10:32.133
All right.

00:10:32.334 --> 00:10:36.170
So, first of all, I would like to know your names. Individual names.

00:10:36.492 --> 00:10:39.372
Yogi: This is a car
full of people last night who come.

00:10:39.558 --> 00:10:41.130
Shri Mataji: So did the havan today?

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:43.658
Yogi: No… Shri Mataji: They were not here. What’s your name?

00:10:43.848 --> 00:10:45.848
Yogini: Hansa. Hansa?

00:10:46.262 --> 00:10:47.762
Hansa…?

00:10:47.918 --> 00:10:49.660
Yogi: Hansa. Shri Mataji: Hansaj!

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.418
What’s your name? Another Yogi: Suresh. Shri Mataji: Suresh.

00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:54.444
What’s yours?

00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:56.601
Yogini: Anish. Shri Mataji: Anish.

00:11:50.602 --> 00:11:53.602
Shri Mataji: How are you? What’s your name?

00:11:54.984 --> 00:11:59.023
He likes my photograph, see...

00:12:05.528 --> 00:12:07.528
What’s your name?

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.490
Surrender.

00:12:21.827 --> 00:12:23.827
That’s a good thing.

00:12:25.793 --> 00:12:28.193
He’s curable, he can be cured.

00:12:30.988 --> 00:12:35.488
Give him some of my kum kum to be put in the night for him.

00:12:39.037 --> 00:12:43.375
It’s all right. Now, I would like to know
other names also. Now, what’s your name?

00:12:43.576 --> 00:12:46.127
Young girl: Rachael. Yogi: Rachael. Shri Mataji: Rachael.

00:12:46.308 --> 00:12:49.363
All right, for her she has a little problem here

00:12:49.563 --> 00:12:51.660
and it’s not due to the liver

00:12:51.861 --> 00:12:57.020
so you treat her liver, she’ll be all
right, perfectly all right here and also,

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:01.320
we get in India something called Multani Mitti.

00:13:02.298 --> 00:13:06.898
In India we get something called Multani Mitti. It’s a kind of a...

00:13:07.132 --> 00:13:10.832
- Did a yogi give somebody a packet or something?

00:13:11.646 --> 00:13:13.879
For treatment of the skin.

00:13:15.598 --> 00:13:17.568
Yes, did he give?

00:13:17.887 --> 00:13:20.887
Yogi Mahajan? Did he give you? A yogini: No.

00:13:21.683 --> 00:13:26.063
Shri Mataji: No. So you see if you use that, that clears your...

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.440
Yogi: Sort of ointment is it?
Shri Mataji: It’s a clay, it’s a kind of clay.

00:13:31.699 --> 00:13:35.199
It’s a kind of clay that clears it out.

00:13:37.303 --> 00:13:40.260
What I can… Yogini: We have got some sort of

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.207
solid pieces of clay.

00:13:44.575 --> 00:13:47.042
Shri Mataji: Let me have, let us see.

00:13:53.897 --> 00:13:57.604
All right. So now, you put your left hand here.

00:13:57.788 --> 00:14:00.948
All right Rachael? No, left hand here. This side.

00:14:01.149 --> 00:14:04.880
Now, what about your name? Other young girl: Rebecca.

00:14:06.169 --> 00:14:09.620
Brian Bell: Rebecca. Shri Mataji:
Rebecca. Brian Bell: Rachael and Rebecca.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.575
Shri Mataji: She’s all right. Children
are all right, both of them are all right.

00:14:12.776 --> 00:14:17.482
Little, she has a little liver problem
and mother also has a little liver problem

00:14:17.682 --> 00:14:19.580
because she worries a lot

00:14:19.819 --> 00:14:23.647
and I’ve already told her. Did you get my message?

00:14:23.835 --> 00:14:27.413
You are to stand up on your legs and say that, you see clearly.

00:14:27.624 --> 00:14:30.694
After all, no husband should be a dictater.

00:14:30.895 --> 00:14:35.826
What love has he given is the point. How much
he has loved is the point, how much compassion

00:14:36.027 --> 00:14:41.248
and as you do not force him to come to
Sahaja Yoga, he should not force you to go on an act.

00:14:41.449 --> 00:14:45.755
See, the act you don’t like, you don’t like to
go to the sea, you should say, “I don’t like it,

00:14:45.955 --> 00:14:48.140
I feel sick, so why do you want to take me?”

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:52.260
So I think you also go for a little
liver treatment, it will be a good idea.

00:14:55.797 --> 00:14:57.878
Now, what’s her name?

00:14:58.728 --> 00:15:02.628
Brian Bell: Adrian. Shri Mataji:
Adrian, I know. Next to him, yeah.

00:15:02.829 --> 00:15:06.389
Brian Bell: This is Margaret.
Shri Mataji: Margaret, Margaret. She's all right.

00:15:10.679 --> 00:15:12.379
David, I know.

00:15:12.794 --> 00:15:15.866
This one was there at the program.

00:15:16.046 --> 00:15:18.113
Were you there for the program?

00:15:18.328 --> 00:15:21.195
Brian Bell: He was here for Puja yesterday.

00:15:21.984 --> 00:15:25.985
Shri Mataji: And what’s his name?
Brian Bell: Greg. Shri Mataji: Greg.

00:15:26.204 --> 00:15:29.442
So how are you, Greg? Are you feeling better now?

00:15:30.954 --> 00:15:35.491
Dorothy’s all right, I can see that. Brian Bell: Gladys, this is Gladys.

00:15:35.692 --> 00:15:38.980
Shri Mataji: But she told me her
name is Dorothy. Brian Bell: Dorothy’s the…

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:42.447
Shri Mataji: Another one?

00:15:43.283 --> 00:15:46.905
She’s Gladys. They look so much the same.

00:15:48.429 --> 00:15:51.437
To a Mother, everybody looks the same, I think.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.415
She has been to India and a very nice person.

00:16:00.331 --> 00:16:03.415
What have you done to the sweets that she has given us?

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.388
Have you’ve been,

00:16:05.612 --> 00:16:10.160
- Are you better pack it up properly,
otherwise these Australians will trouble us a lot.

00:16:12.068 --> 00:16:14.420
Smuggling business is bad.

00:16:14.679 --> 00:16:19.180
You see we couldn’t smuggle all the mangos.
We have brought so many mangoes for all of you

00:16:19.381 --> 00:16:23.366
and they wouldn’t allow us to take them in
and I was very angry. I said this is very wrong.

00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:29.227
You see, these mangoes, after all, there’s nothing’s
going to go wrong with it, we’re going to all eat it off.

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.680
They said no, no.

00:16:32.088 --> 00:16:34.757
And they argued and argued and argued.

00:16:36.567 --> 00:16:38.567
Now, what’s your name?

00:16:38.838 --> 00:16:41.775
Yogi: Bryce. Brian Bell: Bryce.

00:16:41.976 --> 00:16:44.951
Shri Mataji: Price? Price, P-R-I-C-E?

00:16:45.411 --> 00:16:47.849
Shri Mataji: Bryce, Bryce.

00:16:48.029 --> 00:16:53.109
You have different names, isn’t it,
in New Zealand? Little different, yes.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.990
Now, her’s I know. What’s your name?

00:16:56.191 --> 00:16:57.940
Yogini: Janie, Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji: Jane?

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:01.082
Brian Bell: Janie. Shri Mataji: Janie, Janie.

00:17:01.283 --> 00:17:06.167
This one I know. What’s her name
there? I’ve also know Pritisha, yes.

00:17:06.355 --> 00:17:09.919
Brian Bell: Carol and Trisha,
Pritisha? Shri Mataji: I know both of them.

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:14.658
She’s been to a Puja and all that, isn’t it, in India.

00:17:15.603 --> 00:17:20.443
Because I was surprised there was no sari for you because

00:17:20.643 --> 00:17:25.315
I remember I had chosen a sari
that’s why I asked from where did you get the sari.

00:17:26.734 --> 00:17:30.968
Yes, no, but you see this is
surprising because I had bought a sari for you.

00:17:31.297 --> 00:17:32.803
Very surprising.

00:17:33.004 --> 00:17:36.300
Many things have happened in Sahaja
Yoga which is very shocking sometimes.

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.078
How these people come into Sahaja Yoga and sort of,

00:17:40.278 --> 00:17:43.187
I just don’t understand why are they there?

00:17:43.387 --> 00:17:47.374
We don’t have to have money problems and things like that.

00:17:47.574 --> 00:17:50.900
If you - I mean there should be no such problem.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.608
But there are some people who come inside, you see, like

00:17:55.273 --> 00:17:59.811
be able to call a fox in sheep’s dress or something like that.

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:01.900
So that is how it has happened.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.528
But definitely I had a sari for you.

00:18:06.814 --> 00:18:11.680
I’ll find out, I’ll try to locate it. I’m sorry for that., really.

00:18:14.813 --> 00:18:17.351
Brian Bell: The only thing
Mother was that you liked the sari.

00:18:17.541 --> 00:18:21.660
Shri Mataji: Oh beautiful! The one you
bought was much better than the one I had bought.

00:18:27.257 --> 00:18:31.700
So very nice coming to New Zealand and
yesterday’s program was very encouraging.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.162
There were so many people, I was amazed because

00:18:34.362 --> 00:18:38.780
we could not send an article, we could not do the television,

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.832
everything was against us and

00:18:41.032 --> 00:18:45.860
we could not also have the article in the Eve’s Weekly.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.810
Nothing came out, only on my

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.090
just see my photograph, just see.

00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:59.328
Brian Bell: Shri Mataji, there are presents,

00:18:59.529 --> 00:19:03.415
some little presents for the people who have been with us,

00:19:03.873 --> 00:19:08.510
who has joined us, our overseas brothers and sisters.

00:19:09.401 --> 00:19:13.596
A present here, a little thing for Dr Rustom.

00:19:13.927 --> 00:19:15.900
Shri Mataji: That’s good.

00:19:21.599 --> 00:19:24.633
I hope it is not an injection bottle.

00:19:25.803 --> 00:19:30.900
Because he is supposed to be looking after my
health. And I don’t know what he’s doing with it.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.718
Well, my husband has told him that you look after my wife’s health

00:19:34.918 --> 00:19:38.823
and today again he telephoned to
ask is Doctor Rostam looking after me.

00:19:39.023 --> 00:19:41.868
I said he is killing me with his looking after.

00:19:42.069 --> 00:19:44.540
Dr Rustom : Well, you are much better, Shri Mataji.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:47.841
Brian Bell: That is for Bala Sahib.

00:19:48.041 --> 00:19:49.940
Shri Mataji: Bala Sahib.

00:19:59.405 --> 00:20:01.460
Bala Sahib: Thank you so much.

00:20:04.944 --> 00:20:06.820
Shri Mataji: That’s my brother.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:09.900
May God bless you.

00:20:10.258 --> 00:20:15.179
Now I adjusted vibrations. After the Puja it started flowing.

00:20:16.529 --> 00:20:20.780
Bala Sahib: Thank you very much and I invite all of you to India

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.340
and to Aurangabad, especially.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:25.260
Brian Bell: Ah, thank you very much.

00:20:30.623 --> 00:20:35.380
For Carol, who has been with us
and helped us over the last few days.

00:20:40.379 --> 00:20:44.100
Shri Mataji: Keep laughing and enjoying, that’s the best.

00:20:47.412 --> 00:20:50.540
She’s got a very good husband, John. It’s a very fine man.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.540
I am sure she’ll enjoy married life with him.

00:20:57.561 --> 00:21:00.636
Brian Bell: And Christophe has been with us and

00:21:00.836 --> 00:21:05.260
before he went to Australia and he’s been very helpful to us.

00:21:06.438 --> 00:21:10.980
Shri Mataji: So sweet of you to have
come all the way and help them, isn’t it?

00:21:13.108 --> 00:21:17.588
Brian Bell: And the television guest from England, for Mark.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:23.522
Shri Mataji: I also didn’t know they were
already married. I thought they are still engaged.

00:21:24.953 --> 00:21:29.667
May God bless you. I mean I
didn’t want them to be married so soon.

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.452
Brian Bell: And for Nick, Mother.

00:21:36.483 --> 00:21:40.288
Shri Mataji: At least, I thought Nick is left
out but he is also married in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:40.489 --> 00:21:44.608
Nick: Married for four years. Three-four years Shri Mataji.

00:21:44.809 --> 00:21:46.740
Shri Mataji: Really?

00:21:47.922 --> 00:21:49.550
Imagine!

00:21:50.242 --> 00:21:53.142
All right. May God bless you.

00:21:54.136 --> 00:21:56.780
I thought you are still little kids.

00:21:57.426 --> 00:22:02.580
Really? Ah, I didn’t know that. Just imagine.

00:22:03.061 --> 00:22:05.127
Brian Bell: And this one is for Mary,

00:22:05.328 --> 00:22:08.140
who we hope will come back again, and again and again.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:11.860
Shri Mataji: She’s coming with us, isn’t she? Yes, good.

00:22:13.413 --> 00:22:15.323
May God bless you.

00:22:15.523 --> 00:22:17.611
She’s been so nice and so good.

00:22:17.812 --> 00:22:20.900
The way she’s done the whole thing, it’s wonderful.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:26.340
Brian Bell: Mother, the tiles that we, that New Zealand gave you for,

00:22:28.214 --> 00:22:32.540
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes I opened them
and saw they were wonderful, really.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.275
Brian Bell: This is the case for them to sit in.

00:22:35.476 --> 00:22:39.480
Shri Mataji: I see. Brian Bell: They actually fit into, they fit into this case.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:44.980
Shri Mataji: I see, I see. They are very
wonderful. I tell you ,everybody was amazed at them.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.094
It was done so well.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:51.073
Brian Bell: Those birds are the native wood pigeon,

00:22:51.273 --> 00:22:56.526
which is a very auspicious bird and very respected by the Maori.

00:22:56.727 --> 00:22:59.076
The two, the wood pigeons. The birds.

00:22:59.276 --> 00:23:01.460
Shri Mataji: The birds. Beautiful.

00:23:01.661 --> 00:23:06.397
Brian Bell: A little bit of, a little bit
of Ganesh. A little bit of, perhaps the -

00:23:06.666 --> 00:23:10.150
Shri Mataji: They have something of
that throughout I saw, because on the sides,

00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:14.860
on both the Swadishthanas
they have put this Kundalini mark.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:20.229
And also here to put a Kundalini means the, if they are on

00:23:20.429 --> 00:23:24.220
-in the mouth if there is Kundalini, then you speak good words, you see.

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:28.180
Is a sign of respect they said, if the Kundalini is here.

00:23:32.528 --> 00:23:36.589
Yogini: We have to wait on this to be built
for the tiles. Shri Mataji: Yes, all right. Yes, thank you.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:39.538
Yogini: Thank you.

00:23:43.034 --> 00:23:47.539
Shri Mataji: So now, I am going away and I wish you all good luck.

00:23:47.764 --> 00:23:49.846
You are going to have too many people here.

00:23:50.046 --> 00:23:52.060
I hope the space would be alright.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:56.420
If there is love, then everything is sufficient.

00:23:56.821 --> 00:24:02.259
See if there is understanding, nobody minds anything.

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:05.020
But if there is no love, one start seeing faults

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:08.420
and finding faults and saying things like that.

00:24:08.735 --> 00:24:14.165
So it is for you people here to establish a complete

00:24:14.578 --> 00:24:17.712
feeling of love and affection

00:24:18.373 --> 00:24:21.678
and also, you have to look after the patients like these.

00:24:21.878 --> 00:24:24.689
It will work out, you can all work it out on chakras

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:27.259
and this would be the first patient you will work out.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.500
And I’m sure you will cure him, I’m sure. Try to work on him.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.647
When you cure him, then let me know because I’m sure you can.

00:24:35.847 --> 00:24:40.903
And this is the one you have to work out on the
chakras only you have to work out. He’ll be all right.

00:24:41.103 --> 00:24:45.070
Brian Bell: Shri Mataji, they come from Hamilton, from a city,

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:50.100
a smaller city than Auckland, quite a
small city but a very very beautiful city

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:55.220
about 2 hours or an hour and a half’s drive away from here.

00:24:55.420 --> 00:25:00.380
And it is been my desire that that would be the next place we would have a centre.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.534
So these, Suresh and his family are from that city.

00:25:04.735 --> 00:25:06.987
Shri Mataji: You live in that Hamilton place, is it.

00:25:07.188 --> 00:25:11.868
But you can come next Sunday and
these will all work it out on him. All right?

00:25:14.408 --> 00:25:17.020
It’s not difficult at this age to cure.

00:25:17.532 --> 00:25:19.740
He’s already smiling.

00:25:22.019 --> 00:25:24.322
His Vishuddhi, more the Vishuddhi he has.

00:25:24.522 --> 00:25:28.060
The Nabhi, the Vishuddhi, the left Swadishthana.

00:26:52.699 --> 00:26:57.059
Parents were worshipping Satya Sai Baba.

00:26:58.714 --> 00:27:01.809
You will have to use the Mahishasura Mardini mantra.

00:27:02.009 --> 00:27:03.609
It will work out.

00:28:00.661 --> 00:28:04.900
… despite the fact he is affected by
this horrible fellow, he’ll be all right.

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:15.710
He was a realized soul and this fellow has fierce attack him.

00:28:15.910 --> 00:28:17.540
Can see it.

00:28:19.304 --> 00:28:22.860
You’ll see, he’s got it.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:25.540
He’ll be all right in no time.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:29.583
This is what it is.

00:29:15.571 --> 00:29:19.088
And this is for the ladies here, who are here.

00:29:21.836 --> 00:29:24.940
Who are the six ladies you said, now?

00:29:25.446 --> 00:29:27.900
Yogini: Ah, Adrienne. Shri Mataji: Adrienne.

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.340
This is a very small thing, Adrienne, for you, all right?

00:29:32.017 --> 00:29:35.956
And, I think, I’ll give you something.

00:29:40.314 --> 00:29:44.749
All right, it's this one, it's nice for both you and your husband.

00:29:47.923 --> 00:29:51.759
And you tell him that what have you got
by doing all this, spending all this money,

00:29:51.967 --> 00:29:55.451
household money you are spending on
these things? For what? What do you get?

00:29:55.660 --> 00:30:01.060
I don’t get any pleasure out of it nor you are getting also.
So many people I have seen they have no pleasures, nothing.

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:05.860
They don’t have good relations with their wives but
I have seen many Sahaja Yogis smiling, smiling Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:11.159
There have very good relations, they live so happily, they enjoy such fun they have by this force

00:30:11.359 --> 00:30:14.620
and with all these things we are
not going to enjoy a good married life.

00:30:15.055 --> 00:30:20.014
That’s the point, you must put down your foot
there. And say: “Are you a Hitler or a husband?”

00:30:20.215 --> 00:30:24.889
Just ask him, then he’ll be all right.
This is not the way to talk to your wife,

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.656
this is not the way to command your wife.

00:30:27.856 --> 00:30:31.860
Say, “I don’t force you to do anything.
Why do you force me to do anything?

00:30:34.748 --> 00:30:38.388
This country which is a free country, not a slave country, is it?“

00:30:38.589 --> 00:30:42.739
That’s what you have to say. And he’ll be all right, I’m sure.

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:47.980
So why don’t you learn how to enjoy
married life? The best is to come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:49.392 --> 00:30:52.060
All right? May God bless you.

00:30:52.816 --> 00:30:56.700
Now we have other ladies? Yogini: Margaret.

00:31:04.146 --> 00:31:07.020
Shri Mataji: May God bless you. Thank you.

00:31:08.666 --> 00:31:10.669
Yogini: Gladys.

00:31:18.916 --> 00:31:23.441
Shri Mataji: The price also written on this,
it is too much. Yogini: You can't read Chinese?

00:31:23.641 --> 00:31:26.860
Shri Mataji: This is, is it Chinese written down? Yogini: I think so.

00:31:27.067 --> 00:31:30.460
Shri Mataji: All right, I don’t mind Chinese.

00:31:33.333 --> 00:31:35.821
May God bless you, May God bless.

00:31:36.996 --> 00:31:39.850
Ah, now I know, it's difference.

00:31:40.051 --> 00:31:43.620
In the smoke, you are looking just the same to me.

00:31:47.493 --> 00:31:50.390
She is only one year younger to me, Dorothy.

00:31:50.599 --> 00:31:54.740
Yogini: No, no this is Gladys.. Shri Mataji: Yes I know but Dorothy I’m saying. Yes, yes.

00:31:54.941 --> 00:32:00.140
Now, these girls, because she’s coming with Melbourne, I want to buy something nice for her there.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:04.140
So this one is Janie. Yogini: Janie.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.300
Shri Mataji: Janie.

00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:11.643
Who else we have? May God bless you.

00:32:12.979 --> 00:32:16.100
Yogini: Patricia. Shri Mataji: Patricia.

00:32:16.494 --> 00:32:18.139
May God bless you.

00:32:19.144 --> 00:32:21.052
Patricia is married?

00:32:22.534 --> 00:32:25.139
No? Ah? Patricia: No, I’m divorced.

00:32:25.347 --> 00:32:28.667
Shri Mataji: What she say?
Yogini: Divorced. Shri Mataji: When was this?

00:32:29.181 --> 00:32:33.060
Patricia: A year ago in Sydney, just over a year ago...

00:32:34.825 --> 00:32:40.295
Shri Mataji: Oh, that’s good. That you are divorced is a good idea.

00:32:42.154 --> 00:32:47.260
To live with a husband who’s not a realised
soul is a headache, I tell you. It’s terrible. Who else?

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.820
Yogini: There is Linda, Mother. Shri Mataji: Come along.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:58.539
It’s very difficult to carry on with a person who is not a seeker.

00:32:58.755 --> 00:33:04.199
And it’s very difficult because he
can never understand. May God bless.

00:33:09.784 --> 00:33:12.700
This time if you are coming to India,

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:17.940
please give me all the details about those who want to get married.

00:33:18.652 --> 00:33:24.401
And of all the people who want to have their children baptised.

00:33:26.518 --> 00:33:31.629
And give me full information, that’s very important. Give me full information about them.

00:33:31.829 --> 00:33:36.180
This time we’ll have better - Did you get any forms here? Brian Bell: Yes, Mother. Shri Mataji: All right.

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.540
So we’ll send better forms to understand.

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:42.180
All right? May God bless you.

00:33:43.038 --> 00:33:48.299
Brian Bell: Bryce has a little gift for you. Shri Mataji: For me now? This is too much.

00:33:50.432 --> 00:33:55.660
Bryce: Makes me very happy.
Shri Mataji: All right, yes, thank you, thank you very much.

00:33:55.963 --> 00:33:59.580
Should I open it? May God bless you. Bryce: Thank you, Mother.

00:34:01.892 --> 00:34:06.499
Shri Mataji: They are very bad at, all
these knots you know, good at Vishnugranti,

00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:13.860
very bad. It is beautifully done.

00:34:25.588 --> 00:34:28.100
Shri Mataji: Oh beautiful,

00:34:29.145 --> 00:34:31.089
so beautiful is -

00:34:33.073 --> 00:34:36.180
Beautifully done, very good.

00:34:36.678 --> 00:34:40.540
In this you can beat and everyone hollow I tell you.

00:34:42.063 --> 00:34:44.317
Look at this, very beautiful,

00:34:45.152 --> 00:34:46.772
so beautiful it is.

00:34:46.973 --> 00:34:49.453
Thank you very much. Very beautiful.

00:34:54.170 --> 00:34:56.055
Is tremendous.

00:34:57.235 --> 00:35:01.611
You have lots of handicrafts and your hands are deft.

00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:04.300
You all must practice, I think.

00:35:05.469 --> 00:35:09.549
Just keep it now in the box, in the
box, it will have to go a little bit down.

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.940
All right, thank you very much.

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:16.580
And I think all of you should develop
some sort of a handicraft, is a good idea.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.635
See the way her aunt is doing this little

00:35:20.947 --> 00:35:25.300
work on the porcelain, it is something so extraordinary,

00:35:26.739 --> 00:35:30.493
is a real piece of art. We have kept it
inside otherwise you’d have shown them.

00:35:30.694 --> 00:35:32.694
A real piece of art.

00:35:33.833 --> 00:35:35.881
So now should we go? Brian Bell: Yes, Mother.

00:35:36.082 --> 00:35:39.740
Shri Mataji: May God bless you all.
Thank you very much, thank you very much.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:44.484
Try to come to India if possible.
Otherwise, I’m coming next year again.

00:35:44.685 --> 00:35:46.699
Yogini: Jai Shri Mataji.

00:35:47.334 --> 00:35:52.204
Shri Mataji: We are coming to that big program in Australia. I hope you are coming to that one.

00:35:52.405 --> 00:35:54.300
Yogini: Oh yes.

00:36:01.945 --> 00:36:04.202
Shri Mataji: People are coming from all over the world

00:36:04.402 --> 00:36:08.180
and even if you cannot manage India, do come to that, please.

00:36:10.873 --> 00:36:14.540
Also, bring some nice new people there, will be a good idea.

00:36:15.086 --> 00:36:16.940
Yogini: Yes, Mother.

00:36:18.533 --> 00:36:21.469
Shri Mataji: If you can remove this, then only I can get up.

00:36:25.507 --> 00:36:28.340
Shri Mataji: You can take this out first of all.

00:36:33.463 --> 00:36:38.820
Adrianne, you should not worry, no worries
at all now. Give me all your worries. Yogi: Right.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.154
Shri Mataji: I can stand up. That’s better.

00:36:44.183 --> 00:36:47.620
It’s a nice three-day sun we had.

00:36:50.227 --> 00:36:53.180
I hope next Sunday you have the same.

00:37:00.735 --> 00:37:03.022
Shri Mataji: We should leave? Brian Bell: Yes, Mother.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:06.780
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:09.820
All the yogis: Jai Shri Mataji, Jai Shri Mataji.

00:37:11.133 --> 00:37:13.147
Shri Mataji: Namaste...

00:37:18.818 --> 00:37:22.530
Brian Bell: We have a program at
4 this afternoon if you want to stay.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.240
If not, you know the other details are next Sunday.
