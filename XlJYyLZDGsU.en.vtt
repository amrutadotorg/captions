00:01:36.915 --> 00:01:41.580
﻿It is such a pleasure, again, to come to Hampstead

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.858
and to the town hall of Hampstead.

00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:51.180
Hampstead has a special place in the play of the Divine.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.204
Perhaps the people living in Hampstead,

00:01:59.227 --> 00:02:04.900
do no know the significance of this place.

00:02:10.447 --> 00:02:16.378
But we know there have been great poets who have created,

00:02:16.622 --> 00:02:21.231
out of the beautiful atmosphere of this area

00:02:23.362 --> 00:02:27.740
and one of them was William Blake

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:32.180
who has said a lot about the future,

00:02:33.023 --> 00:02:35.860
about the future ascent of man.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.740
He is one of the greatest
seers of modern times, I should say.

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.900
Into such details he has gone that it is surprising,

00:02:50.534 --> 00:02:53.220
how a human being,

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.132
could reach that height of
understanding of the Divine laws.

00:03:06.195 --> 00:03:10.780
We understand the laws that are made by human beings.

00:03:14.521 --> 00:03:17.390
These laws also have come to us,

00:03:18.536 --> 00:03:20.881
through our unconscious,

00:03:21.081 --> 00:03:25.140
through that great energy within us,

00:03:25.932 --> 00:03:29.904
which inspires:

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.060
how to regulate our lives,

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:43.420
how to improve and how to give the basics,

00:03:44.302 --> 00:03:47.780
required securities in life.

00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:52.500
The whole social structure was based,

00:03:53.986 --> 00:03:55.986
on the laws,

00:03:56.846 --> 00:04:00.379
that we received from the unconscious.

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.620
If human beings think that they have
got these through their mental projection,

00:04:04.976 --> 00:04:06.820
they are sadly mistaken.

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:13.020
Whatever you project through
your mental effort is actually dead.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.852
It’s already there; whatever
is known to you is in the library,

00:04:19.848 --> 00:04:21.500
you have to just read it.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.700
But whatever new has to be known
comes to you through the unconscious.

00:04:29.037 --> 00:04:32.117
This unconscious knows the Divine laws,

00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:37.820
and by the time it arrives at the human awareness,

00:04:38.465 --> 00:04:43.860
there are some distortions,
there are some misunderstandings.

00:04:44.953 --> 00:04:49.060
That’s how we go on improving our systems,

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.048
our governments, our ideas –

00:04:53.623 --> 00:04:55.623
how to change,

00:04:56.109 --> 00:05:00.431
how to be more peaceful,

00:05:00.631 --> 00:05:05.459
how to be more congenial with each other,

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.660
how to keep countries together,

00:05:09.253 --> 00:05:13.380
bound in some basic things.

00:05:14.011 --> 00:05:17.653
But alas, what we find,

00:05:17.853 --> 00:05:21.260
that human beings have separated themselves,

00:05:22.352 --> 00:05:27.141
nations have separated themselves, the whole world,

00:05:27.977 --> 00:05:31.900
is on the brink of breaking into pieces.

00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:39.820
The laws that are based, actually,

00:05:40.545 --> 00:05:45.460
basically, on the fact that man must love man,

00:05:48.745 --> 00:05:53.820
sometimes start creating hatred amongst human beings.

00:05:56.208 --> 00:06:00.382
But Divine laws never change. They are eternal laws.

00:06:00.904 --> 00:06:04.940
They are the laws that are made,

00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:10.420
for only our well-being.

00:06:11.635 --> 00:06:13.635
Nothing bad can come through them.

00:06:16.953 --> 00:06:21.820
And to understand these laws we have to enter into,

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.189
the Realm, the Realm of God,

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:31.900
into the Realm of where they operate, to understand them.

00:06:32.643 --> 00:06:36.820
For example, to understand the laws
of England, I had to come to England.

00:06:37.612 --> 00:06:43.340
In the same way, you have to enter into
the Kingdom of God to understand those laws

00:06:43.654 --> 00:06:48.380
and you are amazed how effective they are,

00:06:49.126 --> 00:06:51.060
how universal they are.

00:06:52.142 --> 00:06:54.823
Supposing there is a Sahaja Yogi in London

00:06:55.023 --> 00:06:58.820
and one in China, another in Russia

00:06:59.358 --> 00:07:02.900
and one in Australia,

00:07:03.147 --> 00:07:05.580
they speak the same language,

00:07:06.967 --> 00:07:09.140
they know the same thing,

00:07:09.861 --> 00:07:15.743
because these are the laws manifested,

00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:21.980
by the All-pervading universal
Divine power of the love of God.

00:07:22.454 --> 00:07:26.220
It cannot be contained into small pots,

00:07:27.664 --> 00:07:30.580
into small nations,

00:07:31.304 --> 00:07:35.140
into small brains of human beings.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.780
Those laws govern us everywhere.

00:07:41.933 --> 00:07:45.980
For example a flower becomes a fruit under that law.

00:07:47.874 --> 00:07:51.020
A seed becomes a tree under that law.

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:55.460
Your heart pulsates under that law.

00:07:56.416 --> 00:07:59.620
Your food is digested under that law.

00:08:00.408 --> 00:08:03.585
You are brought to your balances, also, under that law.

00:08:03.786 --> 00:08:09.786
For example, you are an extrovert, you work
very hard and you think of the future all the time –

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:12.540
your heart will be attacked.

00:08:13.857 --> 00:08:18.940
Supposing you work too much, means you work
with your brain, your heart will be attacked – a balance.

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:22.060
If you work with your heart too much,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.460
you are en emotional person,
you weep too much, cry too much,

00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:31.100
then your brain goes out. Look at the balance!
The heart should go out but the brain goes out.

00:08:32.222 --> 00:08:35.620
All these balancing forces are worked out,

00:08:36.344 --> 00:08:40.420
by this All-pervading Power of love.

00:08:40.743 --> 00:08:44.460
Now many people have talked
about this All-pervading Power of love.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.253
Everybody says, “This is love”.
There’s a big organisation coming up,

00:08:49.454 --> 00:08:53.488
every third day, I find a organisation of love!

00:08:56.421 --> 00:09:01.389
This All-pervading Power, has been felt by so many before,

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.913
but when they wrote of it others took,

00:09:05.113 --> 00:09:08.590
a key from that, or a clue from that,

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:13.860
and started dead organisations
in the name of All-pervading Power.

00:09:15.244 --> 00:09:19.340
Now, this All-pervading Power is a very subtle thing.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.142
At this human level you cannot feel it,

00:09:22.343 --> 00:09:26.313
it’s a fact, you cannot feel
this All-pervading Power at all.

00:09:26.513 --> 00:09:30.260
If you say, “I feel it!” then you are denying the reality.

00:09:30.537 --> 00:09:33.860
If you want to live with unreal things,

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:37.700
dishonest to yourself, then nobody can help!

00:09:38.157 --> 00:09:41.140
But if you are honest you have to know,

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.020
that this All-pervading Power – when you have –

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:47.483
you yourself become collectively conscious.

00:09:47.683 --> 00:09:51.860
You yourself have a different awareness than what you have.

00:09:53.936 --> 00:09:59.108
Now people might say, “Alright,
We have felt that different awareness!

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.260
We are there!” The other day
somebody told me that, “I am God-realised!”

00:10:07.736 --> 00:10:12.900
I said, “Alright, now there must be
something special about you to be God-realised.”

00:10:13.692 --> 00:10:18.700
And when we talked about things
I was amazed what he was saying!

00:10:19.121 --> 00:10:23.169
And I just couldn’t believe
how could he believe into such a,

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:28.562
thing as pronouncing that he was God-realised.

00:10:30.445 --> 00:10:34.420
So we have to understand that, when these laws operate,

00:10:35.313 --> 00:10:39.300
they operate but we do not
know about them, we cannot feel it.

00:10:39.875 --> 00:10:43.580
At the most we might see a flower becoming a fruit

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.460
but can we say how it becomes?

00:10:48.569 --> 00:10:50.493
It’s a living process.

00:10:50.693 --> 00:10:54.020
All living processes can be only reported,

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.500
but they cannot be explained.

00:10:56.917 --> 00:10:58.917
For example, you can say,

00:10:59.785 --> 00:11:01.785
the foetus is there,

00:11:02.947 --> 00:11:06.820
the foetus has to grow and a child is born.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.400
This is just reporting!

00:11:09.978 --> 00:11:14.740
But how can you explain that
a foreign body goes into a human being,

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.132
into the mother’s womb, and it is not rejected?

00:11:19.332 --> 00:11:24.187
According to all laws known, everything that
goes into the human body has to be rejected.

00:11:24.388 --> 00:11:29.300
But it’s not rejected, it is nurtured, looked after, loved.

00:11:30.458 --> 00:11:34.020
And then at the right time it is thrown out of the body.

00:11:35.947 --> 00:11:39.100
Who does all these things?
We don’t want to know about it.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.220
We have turned our faces to that.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:46.740
We never explain that. We can report
that there is gravity in the Mother Earth

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:52.169
but how there is gravity and why
there is gravity, that we cannot explain.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.098
Alright, this is being very honest I should say,

00:11:55.298 --> 00:11:58.500
that whatever we cannot explain, we should accept it.

00:11:59.211 --> 00:12:02.860
And we have to now know is there any method,

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:08.140
to find out how these things happen, how it is worked out.

00:12:08.806 --> 00:12:14.540
After all, in the realm of science,
you haven’t found out everything so far

00:12:14.849 --> 00:12:17.789
and whatever you have
found out you have only found out,

00:12:17.989 --> 00:12:22.100
the things that you can see,
perceive, by this human awareness

00:12:22.633 --> 00:12:26.660
but nothing beyond. You cannot explain anything.

00:12:28.055 --> 00:12:30.900
And once you know that you cannot explain,

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.580
you just take it for granted and say that, “It’s alright.”

00:12:35.535 --> 00:12:39.740
One of the things that we have
taken for granted is our human awareness.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:45.460
We do not want to think that there must be
some reason God has made us human beings.

00:12:46.877 --> 00:12:49.780
We know there is evolution, that we accept, thank God!

00:12:50.155 --> 00:12:55.540
Now no more somebody is going to
crucify me for saying that you are evolved!

00:12:56.538 --> 00:13:00.220
But nobody want to think why,

00:13:00.869 --> 00:13:06.020
why are we evolved to be human beings: to be crazy people?

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.220
To be paranoid?

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:14.900
Or to be just insured in
some insurance company? To die?

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:19.020
Or to love two, three children
and to leave all the money in their name?

00:13:19.761 --> 00:13:26.300
Or some sort of a limited sphere that
we think of, in which we find satisfaction?

00:13:27.828 --> 00:13:33.380
Was that the reason for this Universal
Being to create us into a human being?

00:13:33.875 --> 00:13:36.860
There must be some purpose, it cannot be purposeless.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.900
Why did He create us? We must all think.

00:13:40.442 --> 00:13:44.260
Is it just to slog and run a rat race and then die?

00:13:44.614 --> 00:13:46.780
Or is there something beyond?

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.300
And when people start thinking about something beyond

00:13:53.093 --> 00:13:58.194
then some create an image
of God and say, “Alright, there is God.”

00:13:58.395 --> 00:14:02.980
Then they say, “Alright, if there is no
God, there is some sort of a Cosmic power.”

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.780
Or they have given big, big
names to all this unknown power.

00:14:08.261 --> 00:14:13.361
It’s a simple name I give it is – Love of God.

00:14:14.452 --> 00:14:16.782
That also many people use, you will be amazed.

00:14:16.982 --> 00:14:20.460
‘Love of God’ – many people use it.

00:14:21.936 --> 00:14:24.580
But when you know this love of God

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.140
then this love flows from you –

00:14:29.853 --> 00:14:34.660
it just emits, it acts.

00:14:35.622 --> 00:14:39.740
It works out the way a flower becomes a fruit,

00:14:40.208 --> 00:14:43.180
in the way all these things happen.

00:14:44.796 --> 00:14:48.140
This flow of love acts

00:14:49.859 --> 00:14:52.940
and that action, you may
call it ‘miracle’ or whatever it is,

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:55.940
but it’s very natural, because if it is flowing now,

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:01.380
on a level that is available to you,

00:15:02.521 --> 00:15:06.273
it has taken you to a subtler level from where,

00:15:06.473 --> 00:15:10.820
you are emitting this, you get connected.

00:15:11.357 --> 00:15:15.460
Say to that tremendous power of universal love,

00:15:16.224 --> 00:15:18.224
then it must act.

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.786
It’s easy to talk about it. I mean you can have people,

00:15:21.986 --> 00:15:26.220
who can give lectures and
lectures and lots of lectures about love.

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:30.505
Also you can see groups of people just moving in a wave,

00:15:32.271 --> 00:15:36.060
like some drugged or

00:15:37.052 --> 00:15:41.820
alcoholic people saying, “Oh, we
are all in love you see! We are moving.”

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.880
But it doesn’t act! Love has to act!

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:52.220
If it is not acting then it is not God’s
love, it is some sort of a mental projection

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:56.005
or maybe your imagination that you are in love

00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:59.438
and you are in a romantic
situation or some sort of a thing like that!

00:15:59.638 --> 00:16:04.300
It’s something like any other human romantic adventure.

00:16:06.247 --> 00:16:08.247
This is not Reality.

00:16:09.004 --> 00:16:14.220
Love of God, in Reality, acts, manifests.

00:16:15.543 --> 00:16:17.620
And how does it manifest?

00:16:19.845 --> 00:16:22.860
As Mohammed Sahib has said,

00:16:23.118 --> 00:16:27.940
that, “At the time of Resurrection, your hands will speak.”

00:16:29.346 --> 00:16:32.339
Their mouth only speaks, not the hands.

00:16:32.855 --> 00:16:37.460
With the mouth they will say, “Alright,
this is in love of God we are doing this.”

00:16:38.366 --> 00:16:44.380
Sometimes I see all these plays going on,

00:16:44.913 --> 00:16:47.699
or we can say the circus going on.

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:53.700
I am amazed how can they befool
themselves and befool others for nothing at all.

00:16:54.415 --> 00:16:58.131
When this dynamic love flows it acts

00:16:58.559 --> 00:17:00.940
because this is the vital love.

00:17:01.731 --> 00:17:06.820
This is the love which has
energy of giving energy to others.

00:17:10.023 --> 00:17:14.860
This is the love that
combines all the energies of the world.

00:17:16.333 --> 00:17:21.606
And if this love, cannot do the work,

00:17:22.036 --> 00:17:27.813
of those energies, what’s the use
of having this love or talk about it?

00:17:28.231 --> 00:17:31.272
So the time has come for people now

00:17:31.473 --> 00:17:36.220
to face it directly and see it directly, what it is.

00:17:37.644 --> 00:17:39.860
But the most surprising thing is,

00:17:40.308 --> 00:17:45.120
that human beings don’t like
the Truth, they don’t like it normally.

00:17:46.058 --> 00:17:51.784
If they are put some show, of artificiality,

00:17:53.553 --> 00:17:56.620
you will get thousands of people here sitting down.

00:17:56.858 --> 00:18:00.275
You may get the whole of Delhi caught up into it;

00:18:00.568 --> 00:18:02.980
some sort of an artificial thing

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.260
which has no relationship with God and his love,

00:18:06.646 --> 00:18:09.107
that is very much more appreciated.

00:18:09.642 --> 00:18:15.300
Because people think by that
they don’t have to achieve something;

00:18:16.218 --> 00:18:19.300
there’s nothing to be done about it.

00:18:20.313 --> 00:18:22.073
For example,

00:18:22.376 --> 00:18:26.465
if I say I am going to take out a diamond from the air

00:18:27.442 --> 00:18:31.060
then thousands will be impressed,
especially in the developing countries,

00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:34.580
where they think diamond is
the last word for God to give us!

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.967
It’s a headache you know that.

00:18:37.918 --> 00:18:41.241
Thank God the diamonds have now gone down in value!

00:18:42.043 --> 00:18:45.646
So now they will take out something else from the air!

00:18:45.847 --> 00:18:50.736
But there are many who are mad after
such people who materialise things and give you.

00:18:50.936 --> 00:18:55.620
I mean, one should use the
brains! God has given us for using it!

00:18:57.554 --> 00:19:03.340
Do you think that God is interested in giving us diamonds?

00:19:06.945 --> 00:19:09.158
Then there are people who will tell you,

00:19:09.358 --> 00:19:13.940
“Alright, if you stand on your
head for ten days, every day,

00:19:14.733 --> 00:19:19.580
then you will have your
Realisation, you will become a great man.”

00:19:20.483 --> 00:19:24.700
So they will do it, because it’s a challenge to the ego.

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.928
But after ten days, having all the headaches and all that,

00:19:28.128 --> 00:19:32.540
you go to the gentleman: he’ll
say, “No, these were your karmas!

00:19:33.216 --> 00:19:36.060
You had some blockages.

00:19:36.755 --> 00:19:40.855
And this happened and that
happened, that’s why you didn’t get it!”

00:19:41.370 --> 00:19:45.528
So you do it with a double energy,

00:19:45.728 --> 00:19:48.700
the same thing again for ten days.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:52.192
Within one month you are
starved, finished, and you might develop,

00:19:52.392 --> 00:19:57.082
epilepsy or something and finish off
in a lunatic asylum – could be, anything.

00:19:58.423 --> 00:20:00.500
There could be some other type

00:20:00.745 --> 00:20:05.380
who would say, “Alright we must all
meditate. Meditate here, meditate there.”

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.385
You cannot meditate! You have to be in meditation:

00:20:09.586 --> 00:20:14.480
means you have to be in that subtle
awareness where you are collectively conscious.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.420
It’s an awareness. It’s a higher
awareness than what you have.

00:20:20.882 --> 00:20:24.688
Now then they start meditating
– meditate on this, meditate on a light,

00:20:24.888 --> 00:20:27.100
meditate on your head and all that.

00:20:30.142 --> 00:20:32.524
You are to be connected first.

00:20:33.728 --> 00:20:36.060
Even prayers are the same thing.

00:20:36.544 --> 00:20:42.420
If you are praying, praying like
mad, God must be fed up, first of all.

00:20:42.778 --> 00:20:46.041
If not, if He is not fed up with you,

00:20:46.241 --> 00:20:50.700
at least one should find out,
“Are we at least connected with God?”

00:20:52.453 --> 00:20:56.740
How are we to believe that
whatever we are talking is heard by Him?

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:01.580
What is the proof?

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.820
We have to first of all establish that there is a rapport

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:12.103
already established between us and God.

00:21:12.303 --> 00:21:16.500
If it is not so, then you are dishonest.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:22.540
Because, if you are a scientist, you must first verify,

00:21:23.258 --> 00:21:28.060
that whatever you are doing, you are doing in a proper way.

00:21:29.323 --> 00:21:33.140
I would say most of the people who have been now,

00:21:33.416 --> 00:21:36.740
going to different groups and churches and this and that,

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.540
are thinking, “What are we doing?
Are we doing something sensible?”

00:21:43.032 --> 00:21:47.500
What have we being doing?
What did our forefathers do? Is it correct?

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:53.020
Did it lead us anywhere or did we lead others anywhere?

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.434
Why not ask this question?

00:21:56.106 --> 00:21:59.220
You see, nowadays, I have seen some people,

00:21:59.512 --> 00:22:03.397
sit down and plan out how to make
it more interesting for people to come.

00:22:03.597 --> 00:22:07.504
I mean, they may start,
for example, a discotheque in a church

00:22:07.704 --> 00:22:10.420
or anything, to make it more entertaining!

00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:14.460
I mean, is that the way you are going to reach God?

00:22:15.937 --> 00:22:20.820
That could be the attitude of any
sect which is not yet connected with God!

00:22:22.156 --> 00:22:28.220
That’s why I would say that,
we, all of us, have to face ourselves

00:22:28.643 --> 00:22:33.220
and ask ourselves honestly,
“Are we connected to God or not?”

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.340
Now, how are we to know whether we are connected or not?

00:22:38.857 --> 00:22:41.900
I mean if you believe you are
already connected I have nothing to say!

00:22:42.552 --> 00:22:46.302
Because this argument can,

00:22:47.005 --> 00:22:50.860
take me away to such an extent
that I will have no time for others!

00:22:51.255 --> 00:22:56.098
The other day one gentleman took half an
hour just arguing and I had to work you know!

00:22:56.426 --> 00:23:02.020
And he kept me busy very selfishly and I said, “Now will
you please stop it and come and see me some other time!”

00:23:02.225 --> 00:23:04.303
And the others were all waiting!

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.380
So we have to find out how far,

00:23:12.369 --> 00:23:17.220
do we know that we are connected to God.

00:23:18.783 --> 00:23:21.420
How are we going to find out,

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:28.312
that is very, very simple. Very simple it is.

00:23:28.513 --> 00:23:33.138
How do you find out that this is receiving my mouth,

00:23:34.364 --> 00:23:37.780
My mouth piece that it is receiving my sound?

00:23:39.089 --> 00:23:42.200
That on the other side a person can hear;

00:23:42.479 --> 00:23:44.740
that means this is working alright.

00:23:46.932 --> 00:23:51.540
Now if I ask a question and that person can answer it,

00:23:51.763 --> 00:23:54.900
that means he is listening to
me and this is working alright.

00:23:57.513 --> 00:24:02.020
Now supposing my talking on this mic,

00:24:02.922 --> 00:24:08.265
is giving some recording there, say on a graph,

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:13.350
and when that person asks the question,

00:24:13.929 --> 00:24:18.180
my answer again goes in the
graph which answers his question,

00:24:18.735 --> 00:24:22.636
then he will definitely believe that the
connection is there. Isn’t it? It’s a simple thing.

00:24:22.837 --> 00:24:25.037
That’s the way we do it everyday.

00:24:28.261 --> 00:24:31.140
There is no question of blind faith.

00:24:32.253 --> 00:24:34.560
So when your hands speak,

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.537
you ask a question, it’s very simple.

00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:41.260
You see, for people it has to be something very serious!

00:24:42.248 --> 00:24:45.188
Oh, you must discuss it

00:24:45.388 --> 00:24:47.475
and talk in a very serious manner!

00:24:47.675 --> 00:24:51.882
The whole is thing is extremely serious as if
there is a big operation is going to take place:

00:24:52.082 --> 00:24:55.320
your stomachs are going to be cut out
and something is going to be pushed into it

00:24:55.521 --> 00:24:58.381
and then your Realisation is going to be worked out!

00:24:58.582 --> 00:25:01.620
But look at the flowers how they become the fruit.

00:25:02.455 --> 00:25:04.624
And how did you become a human being?

00:25:04.824 --> 00:25:07.244
Without any seriousness about it!

00:25:07.445 --> 00:25:12.256
Of course, it is not frivolous, but it is cheerful!

00:25:12.457 --> 00:25:16.580
And the whole thing, if you
understand, that this operation,

00:25:17.425 --> 00:25:20.500
is happening because you are made for it,

00:25:21.317 --> 00:25:23.317
because,

00:25:26.004 --> 00:25:28.088
you are built-in for it.

00:25:28.288 --> 00:25:30.859
All these things are within yourself!

00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:37.134
Just it is a matter of connecting you to the mains.

00:25:37.697 --> 00:25:43.020
And when that thing has to happen it should be the simplest

00:25:43.255 --> 00:25:49.355
because you have already reached a certain point,
only from this point you have to go one step forward.

00:25:50.715 --> 00:25:55.582
For that you need not spend thousands
of years writing books and this and that.

00:25:56.223 --> 00:26:00.222
But people can’t understand.
They have a big objection that,

00:26:00.423 --> 00:26:05.315
“How Sahaja Yoga is just
available to people who just come there,

00:26:05.515 --> 00:26:09.820
their Kundalini rises and they just
get Realisation?” I say, “Why not?”

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:15.500
According to them you must read
some books on law, income tax, everything

00:26:15.887 --> 00:26:19.582
and then find out about God, ultimately.

00:26:19.783 --> 00:26:25.380
Or maybe you should belong to some union or
something, to political party and all that you should do,

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:30.525
and then if you come to Sahaja Yoga,
then you are rightly place for Sahaja Yog.

00:26:30.758 --> 00:26:32.558
It’s not!

00:26:33.619 --> 00:26:36.780
What books do we read for our breathing?

00:26:38.381 --> 00:26:43.580
What knowledge do we have for our breathing?
Nothing. We breath, that’s all! Isn’t it? Simple as that!

00:26:44.108 --> 00:26:48.946
In the same way your
Realisation, is absolutely living and simple.

00:26:49.146 --> 00:26:54.660
For that, you don’t have to waste
your energy on all these artificial things.

00:26:55.203 --> 00:26:58.420
It’s a living process of a living God.

00:27:01.227 --> 00:27:03.817
And then it is to be verified.

00:27:04.018 --> 00:27:06.648
So as Mohammed has said, correctly,

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.500
that, “Your hands will speak.”

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.420
Means what?

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:14.490
To be very frank,

00:27:15.315 --> 00:27:18.420
I must say I am very fortunate, compared to all of them,

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.540
because in modern times you cannot crucify me.

00:27:22.197 --> 00:27:24.100
And Mohammed Sahib,

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:28.660
was given poison and tortured
all his life. That won’t happen to me.

00:27:30.622 --> 00:27:34.420
You cannot cut short my life as you did that of Christ.

00:27:36.016 --> 00:27:40.112
In four years what could he do to these fishermen?

00:27:40.312 --> 00:27:43.260
What could he tell them? Four years is nothing!

00:27:43.655 --> 00:27:47.540
I was working on seven British,

00:27:47.952 --> 00:27:50.155
intelligent people,

00:27:51.217 --> 00:27:53.740
for four years – struggling with them –

00:27:54.092 --> 00:27:58.020
so what are four years for a person like Christ?

00:27:59.826 --> 00:28:02.900
Whatever he tried to say, in a nutshell,

00:28:05.779 --> 00:28:07.940
has to be explained.

00:28:09.015 --> 00:28:12.340
We must find out some other methods by which,

00:28:13.608 --> 00:28:15.700
it can be complimented.

00:28:16.233 --> 00:28:20.045
But anybody who says you have to go
to some other books to find out about him –

00:28:20.245 --> 00:28:22.940
oh – they will be very angry!

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.178
They will not have it. They will have
their own mental projections about it

00:28:27.378 --> 00:28:30.300
and they’ll produce it
before you saying, “See! This is it!”

00:28:31.238 --> 00:28:35.420
And that’s how people are
surprised why none of them are near him

00:28:36.732 --> 00:28:40.226
how they lead such a horrible life and call themselves,

00:28:40.683 --> 00:28:44.062
the followers of Christ or
followers of Mohammed or followers,

00:28:44.262 --> 00:28:47.620
of any other great incarnations on this earth.

00:28:48.651 --> 00:28:52.020
The reason is there is no relationship,

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.140
there is no rapport.

00:28:58.271 --> 00:29:02.260
If there was there would have been no problems

00:29:02.615 --> 00:29:07.060
because they are all related
to each other. As Christ has said,

00:29:07.727 --> 00:29:12.180
“Those who are not against me
are with me.” And who are those?

00:29:12.961 --> 00:29:15.980
I mean you didn’t give him a chance to talk much

00:29:16.545 --> 00:29:20.660
and whatever he has said, he has tried to point out,

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.791
as much as possible, what is going to happen in the future.

00:29:25.047 --> 00:29:27.260
He has talked of the future.

00:29:27.499 --> 00:29:32.140
He has said, “I’ll send you a
counsellor, I’ll send you a redeemer.”

00:29:32.803 --> 00:29:37.365
He has talked about this, but
what about looking out for that?

00:29:37.566 --> 00:29:39.379
Instead of that people are satisfied:

00:29:39.579 --> 00:29:43.941
Sunday morning, get ready, go to
church, come back home – finished!

00:29:44.934 --> 00:29:48.900
Then they get angry, then become communist!

00:29:50.637 --> 00:29:54.462
They think if this is hell, the other
is heaven! That’s equally the same!

00:29:54.663 --> 00:29:56.663
No difference at all.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.940
Deny God! By denying God are you going to find him out?

00:30:03.679 --> 00:30:07.940
Like a lady who says, “I love my husband,”
and goes for a divorce! Something like that.

00:30:08.141 --> 00:30:09.702
It’s absurd.

00:30:09.903 --> 00:30:13.412
If you love your God and you want to find him out

00:30:13.613 --> 00:30:15.786
then how can you deny Him?

00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:19.740
Alright, some people are wrong but you should find Him!

00:30:20.894 --> 00:30:25.482
Within you resides this great
power of God, which is the Spirit;

00:30:25.682 --> 00:30:29.581
which is described by all
the great scriptures of the world.

00:30:31.319 --> 00:30:35.700
Once you get to that Spirit, once that light,

00:30:36.561 --> 00:30:42.300
the great light of your own Spirit
shines in your attention, you are amazed!

00:30:42.825 --> 00:30:44.917
The whole thing gets integrated:

00:30:45.117 --> 00:30:48.700
your physical, mental, emotional being gets integrated.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.460
That’s how you get rid of your diseases automatically.

00:30:55.614 --> 00:30:59.460
Your Spirit does everything. People sometimes thank me.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:03.020
I said, “What is there to thank
me? I mean I haven’t done anything.”

00:31:03.785 --> 00:31:08.498
You are like a lamp and there is the Spirit,

00:31:08.698 --> 00:31:14.500
only the Spirit has come into your attention by
Kundalini awakening, which is your own Mother.

00:31:15.822 --> 00:31:19.580
You can do it the same way, you can do the same work.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.300
So there is nothing to thank me about it.

00:31:23.392 --> 00:31:25.700
And when it happens,

00:31:26.571 --> 00:31:31.020
you become collectively
conscious, again I say – you become!

00:31:34.119 --> 00:31:39.860
The other day I had a phone
call from someone who is a patient,

00:31:40.236 --> 00:31:44.700
and one of the Sahaja Yogis
has been able to cure that patient.

00:31:46.427 --> 00:31:51.239
The lady, she’s from India – she said,

00:31:51.675 --> 00:31:56.860
“Mother I have been to many
sadhus and saints and real saints and seers,

00:31:58.219 --> 00:32:03.540
but none of them do any upkaar,”
means they do not try to help us out,

00:32:03.873 --> 00:32:07.922
“See, we have to go, touch their
feet and all that, but nobody does this!

00:32:08.123 --> 00:32:11.789
And look at this Sahaja Yogi, for
not paying a single pie to him, nothing,

00:32:11.989 --> 00:32:16.060
he comes every second day and he’s cured me completely!

00:32:16.798 --> 00:32:18.798
And he’s enjoying that.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.940
He doesn’t ask for money, he
doesn’t take tea, he just comes home and

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:27.700
tells me how to do it and just it has
awakened now and he’s trying to establish it.”

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.940
Nobody does that! If you go to
them they’ll give you a big lecture:

00:32:32.811 --> 00:32:35.890
“Don’t do this and don’t do that!”

00:32:36.717 --> 00:32:42.256
All kinds of commandments they
come out with, but they never help us.

00:32:43.276 --> 00:32:45.810
Upkaar has no translation,

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:51.058
in English language, I’m sorry to say, but it
means ‘gracious helping’ in the concrete form.

00:32:51.259 --> 00:32:55.500
You see graciousness is also we can say, “I’m gracious”

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.300
but may not do anything about it, you see.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:01.500
I could be gracious without doing anything about it.

00:33:01.701 --> 00:33:03.700
I can say I’m compassionate

00:33:04.259 --> 00:33:06.743
but may not do anything out of compassion, you see.

00:33:06.944 --> 00:33:11.680
Or you can say that, “Oh, she’s very
compassionate!” But what has she done?

00:33:12.398 --> 00:33:16.700
It’s a concrete thing that you do
out of your compassion; is upkaar.

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.940
And that’s what she said and I was amazed really:

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.399
what are they doing all these saints

00:33:23.679 --> 00:33:26.300
who are such great born-realised souls.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:30.580
In India we have many saints, you will be
surprised; everywhere I find there are saints.

00:33:31.073 --> 00:33:35.573
They are quite satisfied with themselves but
they are not bothered that they have to help others:

00:33:35.774 --> 00:33:38.820
and a gracious help;

00:33:39.137 --> 00:33:41.086
which could be health,

00:33:41.492 --> 00:33:44.420
could be their well-being,

00:33:44.741 --> 00:33:47.700
could be their family relationships,

00:33:48.641 --> 00:33:51.340
or could be their spiritual ascent.

00:33:51.728 --> 00:33:53.715
But spiritual ascent is the main thing!

00:33:53.915 --> 00:33:57.580
If that happens everything works out automatically.

00:33:57.892 --> 00:34:01.180
Like when the light is put in, you see everything clearly.

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:04.860
In the same way, once this
thing happens, it should work out.

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.736
I think there is no compulsion of anything.

00:34:10.936 --> 00:34:13.660
Whatever type they are they can come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:15.031 --> 00:34:17.100
Drunkards have come to my programme

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:21.020
and shouted at me at the top of their voices; they have.

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:26.460
Fanatics have come to my
programme with a Bible, about to hit on my head!

00:34:28.901 --> 00:34:33.220
People have come from all
walks of life and all types of people.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:37.780
But once they are changed they know this is the Spirit

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:40.020
and this is what we have to have.

00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:45.340
If you are a seeker you get it much faster.

00:34:46.009 --> 00:34:50.268
If you are a superficial person you will
come only for sickness or something, then your -

00:34:50.468 --> 00:34:54.460
you will feel - curiosity will be
awakened, then you will become a seeker

00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:57.340
and ultimately you will get your Realisation.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:34:59.458
It takes time for some people like that.

00:34:59.658 --> 00:35:04.380
If you are already conditioned and
you have fixed ideas about yourself,

00:35:04.797 --> 00:35:08.580
that God is like this or God is like that,

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:12.580
then you have to come out of it a little bit, gradually;

00:35:13.055 --> 00:35:16.260
and then you see for yourself what it is.

00:35:17.644 --> 00:35:20.500
Sitting in my car, if I had been thinking about this hall,

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:24.580
I would have never have been
able to see what sort of a hall it is

00:35:25.331 --> 00:35:28.220
but when I came in I can see it clearly!

00:35:28.641 --> 00:35:30.500
But supposing,

00:35:30.922 --> 00:35:35.580
I was stuck up with the ideas that I
had about God or Realisation or anything,

00:35:35.936 --> 00:35:37.940
I would have been just there,

00:35:38.256 --> 00:35:41.100
not here to see what it is like.

00:35:41.967 --> 00:35:44.453
So all these things, all the blockages,

00:35:44.653 --> 00:35:48.820
do retard the speed of Realisation, no doubt,

00:35:49.878 --> 00:35:53.900
but all of you have to have
Realisation because the time has come.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.820
This is the special time

00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:59.420
when all of you must have your Realisation.

00:36:00.733 --> 00:36:05.211
What will happen if you do not have
your Realisation? Many people ask me.

00:36:07.492 --> 00:36:11.300
I cannot see any answer to the collapse of human beings,

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.620
collapse of all this Creation,

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.940
if people do not get their Realisation.

00:36:17.372 --> 00:36:20.300
This is the complete emancipation of human beings!

00:36:21.669 --> 00:36:24.980
All the diseases of the world are because of that,

00:36:25.618 --> 00:36:29.140
all the political, economic problems are because of that.

00:36:30.563 --> 00:36:33.740
All other calamities are because of that.

00:36:34.213 --> 00:36:38.100
The nature is trying to teach you, make you understand.

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:41.926
Your own temperament is reacting against you.

00:36:42.774 --> 00:36:44.581
You are restless.

00:36:44.852 --> 00:36:47.740
The whole atmosphere looks so dark.

00:36:48.516 --> 00:36:52.056
That is the time when you start looking out for God.

00:36:52.341 --> 00:36:55.521
If everything is fine, nobody is bothered about God!

00:36:56.138 --> 00:37:00.260
These modern times, called
as Kali Yuga, are the best suited

00:37:01.241 --> 00:37:05.806
and that’s why many people who are seeking God are born

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:11.740
on this earth and they are
a special category of the seeking.

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:17.366
They are called as ‘seekers’ but how
many of them know what they have to seek?

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:22.346
They stick on to things which are absolutely absurd,

00:37:22.546 --> 00:37:25.500
which has nothing to do with God.

00:37:26.973 --> 00:37:30.599
Like a guru says that you can seek God

00:37:30.799 --> 00:37:37.635
through sex relationships is absolutely wrong. You cannot.

00:37:41.562 --> 00:37:45.100
Because it is available to everyone!

00:37:45.615 --> 00:37:51.591
Every person has got it,

00:37:52.475 --> 00:37:57.904
every animal has got it and the more
you are an animal the more you become that.

00:37:58.855 --> 00:38:01.824
You need not run away from it, no doubt,

00:38:02.024 --> 00:38:05.460
but you must have a sane, proper life,

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:09.300
a sane married life, a balanced life,

00:38:10.451 --> 00:38:12.180
then it works out.

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:16.468
As you will grow in Sahaja Yoga then
you will see how much harm it is done,

00:38:16.668 --> 00:38:19.940
to us, to our innocence,

00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:25.500
the way we have played around with our sex life.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.871
It does harm us.

00:38:28.071 --> 00:38:31.317
It can be seen in nature also

00:38:31.518 --> 00:38:37.018
how we suffer from diseases and other kinds of problems,

00:38:37.698 --> 00:38:40.220
because we have lost our innocence.

00:38:40.924 --> 00:38:43.460
It’s alright to say, “What’s wrong?!”

00:38:44.307 --> 00:38:46.580
But no, there is wrong;

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.317
believe me there is wrong.

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:51.860
But before Realisation I
don’t want to say anything about it.

00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:56.660
For example, people would say, “What’s
wrong in smoking?” when I first came to England.

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.300
Now they know it’s wrong.

00:38:59.552 --> 00:39:02.379
Or about drinking, they know it’s wrong.

00:39:02.579 --> 00:39:08.180
But I don’t say, “You don’t drink, you
don’t smoke, or don’t have all those habits.”

00:39:08.479 --> 00:39:10.199
I don’t say that.

00:39:10.721 --> 00:39:14.860
You just get your Realisation, then I will talk to you.

00:39:16.568 --> 00:39:18.980
Before Realisation all questions start,

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:21.780
“Why not this? Why Mother said so?”

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:24.100
“Why this?” and “Why that?”

00:39:26.251 --> 00:39:28.740
But once you get your Realisation

00:39:29.274 --> 00:39:32.860
then you don’t say that, you just give it up.

00:39:33.652 --> 00:39:37.620
Today only somebody, before coming here,
came to see me and he said he has given up drinking.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.113
I said, “How?”

00:39:39.314 --> 00:39:43.460
He came from India and he thought he
was a Englishman, you see now he must drink!

00:39:43.913 --> 00:39:46.939
And he used to drink everything.
He became an expert on that, you see.

00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:50.541
He was about to write a book on
that! I mean, there’s a science of it!

00:39:50.741 --> 00:39:52.523
I said, “How is it you have given up?”

00:39:52.724 --> 00:39:55.994
He said, “Mother, I just can’t
drink now anymore! What to do?”

00:39:56.194 --> 00:40:00.260
He just laughed. I said, “Can’t drink
at all?” He said, “Just can’t drink Mother!”

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:06.140
I said, “What happens?” He said, “Oh, I feel
horrible! It smells like this and smells like that and smells.”

00:40:08.401 --> 00:40:13.820
I think he gets the smell of the molasses
or something, from where it has originated.

00:40:15.365 --> 00:40:17.411
I don’t say anything about those things.

00:40:17.612 --> 00:40:21.900
Many people have told me that, “Mother, in
Sahaja Yoga you cannot come if you are drinking.”

00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:26.580
No, no, you drink a lot. Even if you
have got drunk today doesn’t matter to me

00:40:28.554 --> 00:40:31.728
because once your Spirit is
awakened it will look after you.

00:40:31.928 --> 00:40:34.100
You have that thing within you.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:38.481
That correcting point is within you.
That joy-giving point is within you.

00:40:38.681 --> 00:40:42.620
That emancipating point is within you.

00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:46.580
That ennobling point is
within you. I don’t have to tell you.

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:50.923
Just awaken it and you will be
amazed how powerful you became.

00:40:51.095 --> 00:40:53.321
All your habits drop out.

00:40:56.861 --> 00:41:00.540
All your slavery drops out

00:41:00.822 --> 00:41:02.980
and you become a free man,

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.740
absolutely powerful to handle yourself the way you like.

00:41:08.247 --> 00:41:10.585
This is what it is, the Self-realisation.

00:41:10.785 --> 00:41:14.620
It should act, within and without.

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:20.220
It acts within you and also without – on other people.

00:41:20.915 --> 00:41:23.100
If there is a Realised-soul,

00:41:23.942 --> 00:41:26.661
he acts on others – automatically.

00:41:26.862 --> 00:41:29.936
He need not speak, he need not say anything.

00:41:30.136 --> 00:41:34.180
But it has an effect of making that person relaxed

00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:38.940
and see a balanced view of the whole thing.

00:41:41.351 --> 00:41:45.940
Things change very fast for a Sahaja Yogi,

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:51.983
once he knows the technique of
manoeuvring this wonderful power.

00:41:52.631 --> 00:41:55.728
First you have to get it, then establish it

00:41:55.928 --> 00:41:58.300
and then to know how to arrange it

00:41:59.045 --> 00:42:00.815
and organise it.

00:42:01.016 --> 00:42:05.166
Once you know that, you yourself become
the guru. There is no need to have these gurus,

00:42:05.366 --> 00:42:11.060
for whom you have to pay such a lot of money and
sell your houses and take out your children from schools.

00:42:11.494 --> 00:42:16.494
You become the guru. But you
become the guru who is a real guru.

00:42:16.635 --> 00:42:21.354
The guru who knows all about oneself,

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.820
all about the Divine Power

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:30.904
and all about the real knowledge of how to impart,

00:42:31.104 --> 00:42:35.368
this joy of Spirit.

00:42:37.634 --> 00:42:42.980
I think this lecture has to be stopped now

00:42:43.275 --> 00:42:48.020
because I have spoken so many times,

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:53.500
even in Hampstead; and much more in Caxton Hall.

00:42:55.857 --> 00:43:01.140
And there are people here who are
great Sahaja Yogis sitting down before me,

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:06.260
who look just like you, but if you see them and
talk to them you will find out they are a different type.

00:43:07.208 --> 00:43:13.692
It’s difficult also for anybody to accept
anybody of the same clan as a guru – very difficult.

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:18.782
So we had to send some English
Sahaja Yogis to India to talk about,

00:43:18.983 --> 00:43:23.421
Sahaja Yoga because if I talk they
say, “Oh! She’s from our corner, you see.

00:43:24.079 --> 00:43:28.260
I saw her the other day in the car,” or something.

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:35.420
But they are Sahaja Yogis and you all can become that.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.900
There is nothing like superiority or inferiority.

00:43:39.178 --> 00:43:42.780
There’s nothing like feeling in any way less or more.

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:46.316
You are just going to become. You are just ready.

00:43:46.516 --> 00:43:49.900
They have come earlier so they have
got it and now you are going to get it.

00:43:50.263 --> 00:43:53.700
These flowers will become fruit tomorrow

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:57.020
and the others will become the day
after. What difference does it make?

00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:01.422
Because in the Realm of God there
is nothing like time, it is eternal life.

00:44:01.732 --> 00:44:07.000
It is eternal life where you
enter, where there is no time, no space.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.820
And that is the life one has to achieve.

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:13.660
But not by just lecturing or taking a lecture in,

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:19.899
or thinking that Mataji is quite a good lecturer or bad
lecturer – whatever you may think – that’s not the way.

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:22.740
The time has come of actualisation.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:25.420
Of really getting it within you.

00:44:25.654 --> 00:44:29.340
That’s what it is. Of course for this you can’t pay.

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:35.460
You can’t pay for love. I mean, it’s very childish to say
but some people think that, “How can it be we cannot pay?”

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.086
You don’t have to pay for it. You can’t pay.

00:44:38.286 --> 00:44:43.036
Payment means some sort of an
inferior understanding of the whole thing.

00:44:43.851 --> 00:44:49.701
This is Divine love. How much do these
flowers pay to God for making them into fruits?

00:44:49.858 --> 00:44:52.930
And how much did you pay to become a human being?

00:44:53.335 --> 00:44:55.681
How much do we pay for breathing?

00:44:55.882 --> 00:45:01.142
Maybe in London you are paying because you
have stopped all the air to come in! What to do?

00:45:01.275 --> 00:45:06.415
You have to pay for your own doing, for the
undoing of it you have to pay: that’s a different point.

00:45:06.798 --> 00:45:10.140
But otherwise everything is available to us free

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:13.381
and God’s grace is available to us free. It has to be,

00:45:13.581 --> 00:45:17.581
because it is so vital it has to be free.

00:45:19.921 --> 00:45:25.327
The whole system of God’s working is is fantastic!

00:45:27.578 --> 00:45:32.197
When you become Sahaja Yogis
you will be amazed to know that His,

00:45:33.116 --> 00:45:35.007
television system,

00:45:35.208 --> 00:45:39.718
His intercommunication system, are so well developed

00:45:40.105 --> 00:45:44.123
that we cannot conceive with this mind

00:45:44.714 --> 00:45:48.525
how quick and efficient they are: they never fail.

00:45:48.725 --> 00:45:52.546
We may fail, but they never fail.

00:45:54.592 --> 00:45:58.780
For all of you who are here I am very much thankful

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:03.177
that you have listened to me so carefully,

00:46:03.377 --> 00:46:07.140
but take your Realisation and then go.

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:10.420
You have come here for
Realisation; take your Realisation and go.

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:13.643
There is no fear of anything happening to you.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:19.900
If you belong to some cult or
to some group or to some ideas

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:24.980
you must know that you have to know yourself!

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:29.609
Otherwise how will you know others? You are in a confusion.

00:46:29.828 --> 00:46:34.393
There are many people who come and fight for
some cults or things like that – I am surprised at them.

00:46:34.593 --> 00:46:40.739
Why are you supporting anyone which has not given
you anything? None of your powers are manifesting?

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:44.803
Have they given you some money? No! We
have given them money! Then why are you,

00:46:45.003 --> 00:46:46.786
paying money to fight for them?

00:46:46.987 --> 00:46:50.420
If there is a lawyer, if he
fights for you, you have to pay him!

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:53.587
Have you seen any lawyer who will fight for you,

00:46:53.788 --> 00:46:56.145
for whom you have not given money?

00:46:56.345 --> 00:47:00.293
But the cult business and other things are such,

00:47:00.493 --> 00:47:06.417
that you are so brainwashed
that you think it’s your duty to fight.

00:47:07.034 --> 00:47:11.220
But where are you? Have you
known yourself? Do you know yourself?

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:14.279
Do you know your relationship with you and the whole?

00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:17.652
Do you know your relationship with yourself and this,

00:47:17.853 --> 00:47:23.060
cult of yours which has put you
into a group? You cannot have a group.

00:47:23.426 --> 00:47:27.420
You cannot form into groups. It’s a universal thing.

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:32.620
That cannot be formed into an
organisation. It cannot be organised.

00:47:33.117 --> 00:47:38.642
If it is universal, if it has to do with
the Divine love, you cannot organise.

00:47:38.842 --> 00:47:42.367
Only if it is something human,
which is dead, you can organise it.

00:47:42.567 --> 00:47:47.300
Alright, do what you like! You have
secretaries, president, this that and the other.

00:47:47.747 --> 00:47:51.153
But anything that is living, you cannot organise.

00:47:51.353 --> 00:47:54.208
If you try to organise it dies.

00:47:54.409 --> 00:47:58.551
And that is why one should understand God’s love,

00:47:58.751 --> 00:48:01.687
that flows sometimes as the sap in a tree;

00:48:01.887 --> 00:48:07.068
which goes to all the places, from
the roots it comes and goes all over,

00:48:07.268 --> 00:48:12.079
gives it’s love to the tree, to the bark,

00:48:12.815 --> 00:48:14.815
to the thorns,

00:48:15.188 --> 00:48:19.580
to the leaves to the flowers and ultimately to the fruit.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.836
It doesn’t settle down into one.

00:48:22.036 --> 00:48:27.374
It doesn’t form a group, otherwise the whole tree dies

00:48:27.575 --> 00:48:30.167
and also that group dies with it.

00:48:30.367 --> 00:48:34.595
If the tree cannot live how can that group,

00:48:34.795 --> 00:48:37.562
of cells exist?

00:48:38.731 --> 00:48:42.140
Also, as you have seen in life,

00:48:42.434 --> 00:48:48.060
in the cases of cancer, one cell starts growing,

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:51.340
it starts growing big and big and big.

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:55.034
When it starts growing big it becomes very big

00:48:55.235 --> 00:48:58.909
and whosoever it touches, it forms a group with that.

00:48:59.109 --> 00:49:03.626
It becomes malignant. With
that it tries to overpower others.

00:49:03.826 --> 00:49:06.556
You cannot overpower anyone with love.

00:49:06.756 --> 00:49:09.992
You do not want to overpower anyone. Why should you?

00:49:10.192 --> 00:49:15.300
There is no need to aggress anyone in
this, nor to take any aggression from anyone.

00:49:16.037 --> 00:49:21.140
It is the most balanced personality that you develop.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:24.093
Because love cannot be forced on anyone.

00:49:24.293 --> 00:49:27.140
You have to ask for it otherwise it doesn’t work out.

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:30.462
You cannot force Sahaja Yoga on
anyone. Supposing you come and tell me,

00:49:30.662 --> 00:49:34.540
“Mother my son hasn’t got Realisation,
give him Realisation!” I cannot!

00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:37.234
I cannot do it. It has to work out.

00:49:37.434 --> 00:49:41.380
Even my own son I may not be able to give Realisation too.

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:46.918
If he’s not getting it, he’s not getting
it. You cannot give a certificate to that!

00:49:47.119 --> 00:49:51.220
But the way people come, with the attitude, is as if,

00:49:52.579 --> 00:49:54.980
there can be an aggression

00:49:55.242 --> 00:49:57.460
or there can be a demand.

00:49:57.757 --> 00:50:00.431
I am sorry, you cannot demand it!

00:50:00.632 --> 00:50:04.980
You have to get it, achieve it and deserve it, in a way.

00:50:05.181 --> 00:50:09.749
And that deserving comes through your only one

00:50:09.949 --> 00:50:12.622
and only one quality:

00:50:12.822 --> 00:50:16.191
that is the true seeking.

00:50:18.605 --> 00:50:21.381
If you are not truly seeking,

00:50:21.743 --> 00:50:25.243
then you will always run
after things which are not truthful.

00:50:25.478 --> 00:50:29.300
If you are truly seeking,
then you will discard all that is,

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:32.203
not the Truth and come to the Truth.

00:50:32.403 --> 00:50:35.324
If so, it works out,

00:50:37.276 --> 00:50:39.500
very well and very fast.

00:50:40.011 --> 00:50:41.945
So may God bless you all.

00:50:42.146 --> 00:50:44.533
Those who want to have Realisation,

00:50:45.475 --> 00:50:49.209
have to be settled down a little bit

00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:55.220
and they have to just put their hands towards me like that.

00:50:56.322 --> 00:51:01.593
Before that I don’t mind if you
want to ask any questions. I don’t mind.

00:51:01.793 --> 00:51:04.761
But one should not ask questions

00:51:04.962 --> 00:51:09.300
in such a way that you disturb the whole audience,

00:51:09.618 --> 00:51:15.328
you take away all their possibilities of
getting Realisation, and try to show off.

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:18.512
And if you have to give a big lecture it is better

00:51:18.712 --> 00:51:22.720
you again hire this hall and get
the people and give them a lecture.

00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:27.856
But here people have come, 99%, to get Realisation.

00:51:28.056 --> 00:51:31.486
So one should not be like a
dog in the manger policy, you see.

00:51:31.687 --> 00:51:34.011
If you don’t want to have it – alright, don’t have it.

00:51:34.211 --> 00:51:37.123
You can go away. As I told you I cannot force on you.

00:51:37.324 --> 00:51:40.357
I have not to achieve anything or gain anything from you.

00:51:40.558 --> 00:51:44.140
If you have to gain your own
Self-realisation, you’d better have it.

00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:48.540
But if you just are here to use
this audience for your own purpose

00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:50.740
then that’s not fair,

00:51:51.063 --> 00:51:54.572
that’s not fair at all, because then you can go

00:51:54.772 --> 00:51:59.500
and you can again hire this hall and address to the people.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:05.210
I have seen, also, people standing outside and
shouting and saying, “Oh, come to our organisation.”

00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:09.180
Then why not advertise in the paper and get them for that?

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:12.817
This is not the way to be fair to anyone.

00:52:13.017 --> 00:52:15.237
We would not do that to any organisation.

00:52:15.437 --> 00:52:18.212
For example, if there is an organisation

00:52:18.413 --> 00:52:22.260
which is working out it’s
methods – alright, let them work it out.

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:27.500
We’ll not go and visit that organisation and go on
saying that, “This is wrong, that is wrong,” except,

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:32.654
when there are people who belong to that
organisation who have come to Sahaja Yoga

00:52:32.854 --> 00:52:36.980
and have achieved something then they want
to tell others – that’s a different point altogether.

00:52:37.191 --> 00:52:42.780
But this is not fair and I would
request you that please don’t try to waste the,

00:52:43.050 --> 00:52:46.580
time of other people who are genuine, who are seeking.

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:51.103
If you want to ask any nice, good
question, you are welcome; you should ask.

00:52:51.303 --> 00:52:54.580
I mean, I am open to all your
questioning, no doubt about it.

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:56.650
Thank you very much.

00:52:59.857 --> 00:53:04.740
So, any questions please ask.
Somebody has to be here to communicate to me.

00:53:15.437 --> 00:53:17.860
Anyone has any questions?

00:53:29.738 --> 00:53:35.700
Alright! So just a simple thing
is to put your hands towards me.

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:38.324
I am sure Graham must have told you about,

00:53:38.525 --> 00:53:41.420
these finger tips have got the five centres,

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:46.180
and six and seven centres. These are
right and left sympathetic nervous systems,

00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:50.700
within us which have got these centres working here.

00:53:51.329 --> 00:53:55.460
Now, whatever I say, you need not believe in me altogether.

00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:59.360
But also should not deny me
because I am not doing anything to you.

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:03.398
Just to expect something that will happen to you

00:54:03.598 --> 00:54:07.241
which I do not want to tell you
because, you see, people come with an attitude

00:54:07.441 --> 00:54:11.207
as if I am going to mesmerise them
and take away something from you.

00:54:11.407 --> 00:54:13.697
And then they think, “Oh, why this and why that?”

00:54:13.897 --> 00:54:18.018
I do not want to take anything
from you whatsoever, take it from me.

00:54:18.686 --> 00:54:20.940
And I do not want anything from you.

00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:25.103
Only thing is, if you cooperate
with me a little, it will work out.

00:54:25.303 --> 00:54:29.679
But if you do not want to have it it’s better
to leave the hall and leave others in peace.

00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.700
I would request you to do that.

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:34.420
Now put your, just, hands like this. Straight like this.

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:38.500
Simple hands, like this, and close your eyes.

00:54:39.755 --> 00:54:42.796
And please don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

00:54:42.996 --> 00:54:45.981
Before doing that I hope you take out your shoes

00:54:46.181 --> 00:54:49.060
because the Mother Earth helps us a lot

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:52.660
and we have a nice wooden floor we can do it.

00:55:01.953 --> 00:55:04.401
Please keep your eyes shut, that’s very important.

00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:08.820
Don’t open your eyes because when
the Kundalini rises above the Agnya,

00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:11.980
it does not rise because,

00:55:15.490 --> 00:55:19.380
if your eyes are open it does not rise.

00:55:34.842 --> 00:55:36.488
This is your own.

00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:41.300
Everything is within yourself, which you have to get.

00:55:44.312 --> 00:55:47.972
As it is, in every Western country I have seen,

00:55:48.172 --> 00:55:52.700
the first blockage is that everyone feels guilty.

00:55:53.890 --> 00:55:56.980
Now I have to again request you not to feel guilty.

00:55:57.475 --> 00:55:59.220
There’s nothing to feel guilty.

00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:05.020
After all you are a human being means
you are at the epitome of the Creation of God,

00:56:06.072 --> 00:56:08.384
and what is there to feel guilty,

00:56:08.947 --> 00:56:13.031
when God is the ocean of forgiveness,

00:56:13.232 --> 00:56:17.420
ocean of compassion, ocean of love?

00:56:17.745 --> 00:56:21.140
Then what is there to feel guilty about? For what?

00:56:21.838 --> 00:56:24.820
You just have to say, in your heart,

00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:27.199
at least thrice, genuinely,

00:56:27.399 --> 00:56:31.024
that, “Mother I am not Guilty.” Genuinely I say, again.

00:56:34.835 --> 00:56:39.900
Put the hands towards me and not
towards yourself or towards your hands.

00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:44.860
Straight please. And now,
just say, “Mother I am not guilty.”

00:56:46.053 --> 00:56:48.980
Please put them straight! On your lap will be alright.

00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:51.460
Be relaxed! Be relaxed!

00:56:53.051 --> 00:56:54.740
Be relaxed!

00:56:56.541 --> 00:57:01.700
There should be no tension about
anything. It will just work out. It is all within you.

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:07.900
It is not going to take any time. And if you have
any diseases and troubles, as a result you will be cured.

00:59:01.625 --> 00:59:05.053
Please keep your eyes shut, because you see,

00:59:05.253 --> 00:59:09.900
it’s no question of curiosity or anything
but it has to work out. It’s very hot today.

01:01:06.657 --> 01:01:09.100
Now put your right hand, without opening your eyes,

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:12.473
please put it on the heart.

01:01:12.673 --> 01:01:17.340
Right had on the heart, without
opening your eyes. Please put it on the heart

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:22.916
and ask a question in your heart, a question –

01:01:23.116 --> 01:01:27.220
this is the establishment of the rapport – a question,

01:01:27.692 --> 01:01:31.980
“Mother am I the Spirit?”
Ask a question, “Am I the Spirit?”

01:01:34.161 --> 01:01:36.140
Right on the heart please.

01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:39.500
“Mother am I the Spirit?”

01:01:40.041 --> 01:01:43.438
Some have put it higher some
have put it lower so put it just,

01:01:43.639 --> 01:01:46.079
on the heart where you feel the beat.

01:01:47.188 --> 01:01:50.563
And please ask a question, “Mother am I the Spirit?”

01:01:55.079 --> 01:01:56.879
Which you are!

01:02:01.665 --> 01:02:03.740
“Am I the Atma?”

01:02:22.515 --> 01:02:26.740
Now put the same right hand on top of your head, on top,

01:02:27.955 --> 01:02:31.340
touching it in the centre of the fontanelle bone area,

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:35.680
where the fontanelle bone is,
where you had a soft bone in the head.

01:02:35.881 --> 01:02:39.940
Just it is little on the front side.

01:02:40.195 --> 01:02:45.461
It is more on the front side. Now press
it with your fingers, in the central parting.

01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:50.100
Press it with your fingers and turn it clockwise.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.020
I am telling you how to do it for yourself.

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:57.700
Press it hard and turn it clockwise with your fingers!

01:02:57.987 --> 01:03:00.340
Turn the scalp clockwise.

01:03:01.253 --> 01:03:06.880
Put your fingers in such a
way that they lie parallel to your,

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:12.595
hair parting, same way.

01:03:14.142 --> 01:03:18.460
Now, raise your hand up on the head –

01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:20.820
higher –

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.020
and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

01:03:44.558 --> 01:03:47.827
Higher than your head then you will feel it.

01:03:49.275 --> 01:03:52.275
Some people will feel it in the
hand. Some people will feel it hot.

01:03:52.476 --> 01:03:56.089
You can put now your left hand,
without opening your eyes please,

01:03:56.289 --> 01:03:58.900
and put your left hand on top of your head

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.755
and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

01:04:01.956 --> 01:04:04.580
And right hand towards me, on your lap.

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.825
Please put your right hand towards me on your lap.

01:04:40.887 --> 01:04:44.887
Now see in your hands if it is cool breeze is coming now.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:20.406
Those who are getting the cool breeze raise your hands!

01:05:22.704 --> 01:05:24.514
So many new people!

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.920
Raise them higher!

01:05:27.744 --> 01:05:29.244
Good.

01:05:29.688 --> 01:05:33.298
Slowly everybody will be
getting, slowly. Yes, may God bless you.

01:05:33.494 --> 01:05:36.501
Slowly everybody will be getting it, just keep it up!

01:05:36.705 --> 01:05:38.385
Just keep it on!

01:05:49.044 --> 01:05:51.144
Put down your hands please.

01:05:54.588 --> 01:05:58.220
Now, if you can open your eyes slowly.
