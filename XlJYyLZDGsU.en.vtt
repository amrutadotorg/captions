01:36.915 --> 01:41.580
﻿It is such a pleasure, again, to come to Hampstead

01:41.780 --> 01:44.858
and to the town hall of Hampstead.

01:46.353 --> 01:51.180
Hampstead has a special place in the play of the Divine.

01:52.040 --> 01:58.204
Perhaps the people living in Hampstead,

01:59.227 --> 02:04.900
do no know the significance of this place.

02:10.447 --> 02:16.378
But we know there have been great poets who have created,

02:16.622 --> 02:21.231
out of the beautiful atmosphere of this area

02:23.362 --> 02:27.740
and one of them was William Blake

02:29.429 --> 02:32.180
who has said a lot about the future,

02:33.023 --> 02:35.860
about the future ascent of man.

02:37.740 --> 02:41.740
He is one of the greatest
seers of modern times, I should say.

02:42.349 --> 02:45.900
Into such details he has gone that it is surprising,

02:50.534 --> 02:53.220
how a human being,

02:58.829 --> 03:04.132
could reach that height of
understanding of the Divine laws.

03:06.195 --> 03:10.780
We understand the laws that are made by human beings.

03:14.521 --> 03:17.390
These laws also have come to us,

03:18.536 --> 03:20.881
through our unconscious,

03:21.081 --> 03:25.140
through that great energy within us,

03:25.932 --> 03:29.904
which inspires:

03:32.850 --> 03:37.060
how to regulate our lives,

03:37.834 --> 03:43.420
how to improve and how to give the basics,

03:44.302 --> 03:47.780
required securities in life.

03:49.917 --> 03:52.500
The whole social structure was based,

03:53.986 --> 03:55.986
on the laws,

03:56.846 --> 04:00.379
that we received from the unconscious.

04:00.579 --> 04:04.620
If human beings think that they have
got these through their mental projection,

04:04.976 --> 04:06.820
they are sadly mistaken.

04:07.929 --> 04:13.020
Whatever you project through
your mental effort is actually dead.

04:13.220 --> 04:18.852
It’s already there; whatever
is known to you is in the library,

04:19.848 --> 04:21.500
you have to just read it.

04:21.700 --> 04:26.700
But whatever new has to be known
comes to you through the unconscious.

04:29.037 --> 04:32.117
This unconscious knows the Divine laws,

04:34.121 --> 04:37.820
and by the time it arrives at the human awareness,

04:38.465 --> 04:43.860
there are some distortions,
there are some misunderstandings.

04:44.953 --> 04:49.060
That’s how we go on improving our systems,

04:49.320 --> 04:53.048
our governments, our ideas –

04:53.623 --> 04:55.623
how to change,

04:56.109 --> 05:00.431
how to be more peaceful,

05:00.631 --> 05:05.459
how to be more congenial with each other,

05:05.660 --> 05:08.660
how to keep countries together,

05:09.253 --> 05:13.380
bound in some basic things.

05:14.011 --> 05:17.653
But alas, what we find,

05:17.853 --> 05:21.260
that human beings have separated themselves,

05:22.352 --> 05:27.141
nations have separated themselves, the whole world,

05:27.977 --> 05:31.900
is on the brink of breaking into pieces.

05:35.225 --> 05:39.820
The laws that are based, actually,

05:40.545 --> 05:45.460
basically, on the fact that man must love man,

05:48.745 --> 05:53.820
sometimes start creating hatred amongst human beings.

05:56.208 --> 06:00.382
But Divine laws never change. They are eternal laws.

06:00.904 --> 06:04.940
They are the laws that are made,

06:07.989 --> 06:10.420
for only our well-being.

06:11.635 --> 06:13.635
Nothing bad can come through them.

06:16.953 --> 06:21.820
And to understand these laws we have to enter into,

06:24.460 --> 06:27.189
the Realm, the Realm of God,

06:27.389 --> 06:31.900
into the Realm of where they operate, to understand them.

06:32.643 --> 06:36.820
For example, to understand the laws
of England, I had to come to England.

06:37.612 --> 06:43.340
In the same way, you have to enter into
the Kingdom of God to understand those laws

06:43.654 --> 06:48.380
and you are amazed how effective they are,

06:49.126 --> 06:51.060
how universal they are.

06:52.142 --> 06:54.823
Supposing there is a Sahaja Yogi in London

06:55.023 --> 06:58.820
and one in China, another in Russia

06:59.358 --> 07:02.900
and one in Australia,

07:03.147 --> 07:05.580
they speak the same language,

07:06.967 --> 07:09.140
they know the same thing,

07:09.861 --> 07:15.743
because these are the laws manifested,

07:16.361 --> 07:21.980
by the All-pervading universal
Divine power of the love of God.

07:22.454 --> 07:26.220
It cannot be contained into small pots,

07:27.664 --> 07:30.580
into small nations,

07:31.304 --> 07:35.140
into small brains of human beings.

07:37.660 --> 07:40.780
Those laws govern us everywhere.

07:41.933 --> 07:45.980
For example a flower becomes a fruit under that law.

07:47.874 --> 07:51.020
A seed becomes a tree under that law.

07:52.030 --> 07:55.460
Your heart pulsates under that law.

07:56.416 --> 07:59.620
Your food is digested under that law.

08:00.408 --> 08:03.585
You are brought to your balances, also, under that law.

08:03.786 --> 08:09.786
For example, you are an extrovert, you work
very hard and you think of the future all the time –

08:10.115 --> 08:12.540
your heart will be attacked.

08:13.857 --> 08:18.940
Supposing you work too much, means you work
with your brain, your heart will be attacked – a balance.

08:19.450 --> 08:22.060
If you work with your heart too much,

08:22.260 --> 08:25.460
you are en emotional person,
you weep too much, cry too much,

08:26.589 --> 08:31.100
then your brain goes out. Look at the balance!
The heart should go out but the brain goes out.

08:32.222 --> 08:35.620
All these balancing forces are worked out,

08:36.344 --> 08:40.420
by this All-pervading Power of love.

08:40.743 --> 08:44.460
Now many people have talked
about this All-pervading Power of love.

08:44.660 --> 08:49.253
Everybody says, “This is love”.
There’s a big organisation coming up,

08:49.454 --> 08:53.488
every third day, I find a organisation of love!

08:56.421 --> 09:01.389
This All-pervading Power, has been felt by so many before,

09:01.740 --> 09:04.913
but when they wrote of it others took,

09:05.113 --> 09:08.590
a key from that, or a clue from that,

09:08.790 --> 09:13.860
and started dead organisations
in the name of All-pervading Power.

09:15.244 --> 09:19.340
Now, this All-pervading Power is a very subtle thing.

09:19.680 --> 09:22.142
At this human level you cannot feel it,

09:22.343 --> 09:26.313
it’s a fact, you cannot feel
this All-pervading Power at all.

09:26.513 --> 09:30.260
If you say, “I feel it!” then you are denying the reality.

09:30.537 --> 09:33.860
If you want to live with unreal things,

09:34.060 --> 09:37.700
dishonest to yourself, then nobody can help!

09:38.157 --> 09:41.140
But if you are honest you have to know,

09:41.340 --> 09:44.020
that this All-pervading Power – when you have –

09:44.220 --> 09:47.483
you yourself become collectively conscious.

09:47.683 --> 09:51.860
You yourself have a different awareness than what you have.

09:53.936 --> 09:59.108
Now people might say, “Alright,
We have felt that different awareness!

10:00.460 --> 10:04.260
We are there!” The other day
somebody told me that, “I am God-realised!”

10:07.736 --> 10:12.900
I said, “Alright, now there must be
something special about you to be God-realised.”

10:13.692 --> 10:18.700
And when we talked about things
I was amazed what he was saying!

10:19.121 --> 10:23.169
And I just couldn’t believe
how could he believe into such a,

10:23.370 --> 10:28.562
thing as pronouncing that he was God-realised.

10:30.445 --> 10:34.420
So we have to understand that, when these laws operate,

10:35.313 --> 10:39.300
they operate but we do not
know about them, we cannot feel it.

10:39.875 --> 10:43.580
At the most we might see a flower becoming a fruit

10:43.780 --> 10:46.460
but can we say how it becomes?

10:48.569 --> 10:50.493
It’s a living process.

10:50.693 --> 10:54.020
All living processes can be only reported,

10:54.220 --> 10:56.500
but they cannot be explained.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.917
For example, you can say,

10:59.785 --> 11:01.785
the foetus is there,

11:02.947 --> 11:06.820
the foetus has to grow and a child is born.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.400
This is just reporting!

11:09.978 --> 11:14.740
But how can you explain that
a foreign body goes into a human being,

11:16.020 --> 11:19.132
into the mother’s womb, and it is not rejected?

11:19.332 --> 11:24.187
According to all laws known, everything that
goes into the human body has to be rejected.

11:24.388 --> 11:29.300
But it’s not rejected, it is nurtured, looked after, loved.

11:30.458 --> 11:34.020
And then at the right time it is thrown out of the body.

11:35.947 --> 11:39.100
Who does all these things?
We don’t want to know about it.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.220
We have turned our faces to that.

11:41.420 --> 11:46.740
We never explain that. We can report
that there is gravity in the Mother Earth

11:46.940 --> 11:52.169
but how there is gravity and why
there is gravity, that we cannot explain.

11:52.370 --> 11:55.098
Alright, this is being very honest I should say,

11:55.298 --> 11:58.500
that whatever we cannot explain, we should accept it.

11:59.211 --> 12:02.860
And we have to now know is there any method,

12:03.060 --> 12:08.140
to find out how these things happen, how it is worked out.

12:08.806 --> 12:14.540
After all, in the realm of science,
you haven’t found out everything so far

12:14.849 --> 12:17.789
and whatever you have
found out you have only found out,

12:17.989 --> 12:22.100
the things that you can see,
perceive, by this human awareness

12:22.633 --> 12:26.660
but nothing beyond. You cannot explain anything.

12:28.055 --> 12:30.900
And once you know that you cannot explain,

12:31.100 --> 12:34.580
you just take it for granted and say that, “It’s alright.”

12:35.535 --> 12:39.740
One of the things that we have
taken for granted is our human awareness.

12:39.940 --> 12:45.460
We do not want to think that there must be
some reason God has made us human beings.

12:46.877 --> 12:49.780
We know there is evolution, that we accept, thank God!

12:50.155 --> 12:55.540
Now no more somebody is going to
crucify me for saying that you are evolved!

12:56.538 --> 13:00.220
But nobody want to think why,

13:00.869 --> 13:06.020
why are we evolved to be human beings: to be crazy people?

13:06.220 --> 13:08.220
To be paranoid?

13:08.440 --> 13:14.900
Or to be just insured in
some insurance company? To die?

13:15.100 --> 13:19.020
Or to love two, three children
and to leave all the money in their name?

13:19.761 --> 13:26.300
Or some sort of a limited sphere that
we think of, in which we find satisfaction?

13:27.828 --> 13:33.380
Was that the reason for this Universal
Being to create us into a human being?

13:33.875 --> 13:36.860
There must be some purpose, it cannot be purposeless.

13:37.060 --> 13:39.900
Why did He create us? We must all think.

13:40.442 --> 13:44.260
Is it just to slog and run a rat race and then die?

13:44.614 --> 13:46.780
Or is there something beyond?

13:46.980 --> 13:51.300
And when people start thinking about something beyond

13:53.093 --> 13:58.194
then some create an image
of God and say, “Alright, there is God.”

13:58.395 --> 14:02.980
Then they say, “Alright, if there is no
God, there is some sort of a Cosmic power.”

14:03.180 --> 14:07.780
Or they have given big, big
names to all this unknown power.

14:08.261 --> 14:13.361
It’s a simple name I give it is – Love of God.

14:14.452 --> 14:16.782
That also many people use, you will be amazed.

14:16.982 --> 14:20.460
‘Love of God’ – many people use it.

14:21.936 --> 14:24.580
But when you know this love of God

14:24.780 --> 14:28.140
then this love flows from you –

14:29.853 --> 14:34.660
it just emits, it acts.

14:35.622 --> 14:39.740
It works out the way a flower becomes a fruit,

14:40.208 --> 14:43.180
in the way all these things happen.

14:44.796 --> 14:48.140
This flow of love acts

14:49.859 --> 14:52.940
and that action, you may
call it ‘miracle’ or whatever it is,

14:53.140 --> 14:55.940
but it’s very natural, because if it is flowing now,

14:56.140 --> 15:01.380
on a level that is available to you,

15:02.521 --> 15:06.273
it has taken you to a subtler level from where,

15:06.473 --> 15:10.820
you are emitting this, you get connected.

15:11.357 --> 15:15.460
Say to that tremendous power of universal love,

15:16.224 --> 15:18.224
then it must act.

15:18.620 --> 15:21.786
It’s easy to talk about it. I mean you can have people,

15:21.986 --> 15:26.220
who can give lectures and
lectures and lots of lectures about love.

15:26.420 --> 15:30.505
Also you can see groups of people just moving in a wave,

15:32.271 --> 15:36.060
like some drugged or

15:37.052 --> 15:41.820
alcoholic people saying, “Oh, we
are all in love you see! We are moving.”

15:42.020 --> 15:45.880
But it doesn’t act! Love has to act!

15:46.360 --> 15:52.220
If it is not acting then it is not God’s
love, it is some sort of a mental projection

15:52.420 --> 15:56.005
or maybe your imagination that you are in love

15:56.205 --> 15:59.438
and you are in a romantic
situation or some sort of a thing like that!

15:59.638 --> 16:04.300
It’s something like any other human romantic adventure.

16:06.247 --> 16:08.247
This is not Reality.

16:09.004 --> 16:14.220
Love of God, in Reality, acts, manifests.

16:15.543 --> 16:17.620
And how does it manifest?

16:19.845 --> 16:22.860
As Mohammed Sahib has said,

16:23.118 --> 16:27.940
that, “At the time of Resurrection, your hands will speak.”

16:29.346 --> 16:32.339
Their mouth only speaks, not the hands.

16:32.855 --> 16:37.460
With the mouth they will say, “Alright,
this is in love of God we are doing this.”

16:38.366 --> 16:44.380
Sometimes I see all these plays going on,

16:44.913 --> 16:47.699
or we can say the circus going on.

16:47.899 --> 16:53.700
I am amazed how can they befool
themselves and befool others for nothing at all.

16:54.415 --> 16:58.131
When this dynamic love flows it acts

16:58.559 --> 17:00.940
because this is the vital love.

17:01.731 --> 17:06.820
This is the love which has
energy of giving energy to others.

17:10.023 --> 17:14.860
This is the love that
combines all the energies of the world.

17:16.333 --> 17:21.606
And if this love, cannot do the work,

17:22.036 --> 17:27.813
of those energies, what’s the use
of having this love or talk about it?

17:28.231 --> 17:31.272
So the time has come for people now

17:31.473 --> 17:36.220
to face it directly and see it directly, what it is.

17:37.644 --> 17:39.860
But the most surprising thing is,

17:40.308 --> 17:45.120
that human beings don’t like
the Truth, they don’t like it normally.

17:46.058 --> 17:51.784
If they are put some show, of artificiality,

17:53.553 --> 17:56.620
you will get thousands of people here sitting down.

17:56.858 --> 18:00.275
You may get the whole of Delhi caught up into it;

18:00.568 --> 18:02.980
some sort of an artificial thing

18:03.180 --> 18:06.260
which has no relationship with God and his love,

18:06.646 --> 18:09.107
that is very much more appreciated.

18:09.642 --> 18:15.300
Because people think by that
they don’t have to achieve something;

18:16.218 --> 18:19.300
there’s nothing to be done about it.

18:20.313 --> 18:22.073
For example,

18:22.376 --> 18:26.465
if I say I am going to take out a diamond from the air

18:27.442 --> 18:31.060
then thousands will be impressed,
especially in the developing countries,

18:31.260 --> 18:34.580
where they think diamond is
the last word for God to give us!

18:34.780 --> 18:36.967
It’s a headache you know that.

18:37.918 --> 18:41.241
Thank God the diamonds have now gone down in value!

18:42.043 --> 18:45.646
So now they will take out something else from the air!

18:45.847 --> 18:50.736
But there are many who are mad after
such people who materialise things and give you.

18:50.936 --> 18:55.620
I mean, one should use the
brains! God has given us for using it!

18:57.554 --> 19:03.340
Do you think that God is interested in giving us diamonds?

19:06.945 --> 19:09.158
Then there are people who will tell you,

19:09.358 --> 19:13.940
“Alright, if you stand on your
head for ten days, every day,

19:14.733 --> 19:19.580
then you will have your
Realisation, you will become a great man.”

19:20.483 --> 19:24.700
So they will do it, because it’s a challenge to the ego.

19:24.900 --> 19:27.928
But after ten days, having all the headaches and all that,

19:28.128 --> 19:32.540
you go to the gentleman: he’ll
say, “No, these were your karmas!

19:33.216 --> 19:36.060
You had some blockages.

19:36.755 --> 19:40.855
And this happened and that
happened, that’s why you didn’t get it!”

19:41.370 --> 19:45.528
So you do it with a double energy,

19:45.728 --> 19:48.700
the same thing again for ten days.

19:49.120 --> 19:52.192
Within one month you are
starved, finished, and you might develop,

19:52.392 --> 19:57.082
epilepsy or something and finish off
in a lunatic asylum – could be, anything.

19:58.423 --> 20:00.500
There could be some other type

20:00.745 --> 20:05.380
who would say, “Alright we must all
meditate. Meditate here, meditate there.”

20:06.260 --> 20:09.385
You cannot meditate! You have to be in meditation:

20:09.586 --> 20:14.480
means you have to be in that subtle
awareness where you are collectively conscious.

20:14.680 --> 20:18.420
It’s an awareness. It’s a higher
awareness than what you have.

20:20.882 --> 20:24.688
Now then they start meditating
– meditate on this, meditate on a light,

20:24.888 --> 20:27.100
meditate on your head and all that.

20:30.142 --> 20:32.524
You are to be connected first.

20:33.728 --> 20:36.060
Even prayers are the same thing.

20:36.544 --> 20:42.420
If you are praying, praying like
mad, God must be fed up, first of all.

20:42.778 --> 20:46.041
If not, if He is not fed up with you,

20:46.241 --> 20:50.700
at least one should find out,
“Are we at least connected with God?”

20:52.453 --> 20:56.740
How are we to believe that
whatever we are talking is heard by Him?

20:59.580 --> 21:01.580
What is the proof?

21:03.620 --> 21:07.820
We have to first of all establish that there is a rapport

21:09.310 --> 21:12.103
already established between us and God.

21:12.303 --> 21:16.500
If it is not so, then you are dishonest.

21:17.430 --> 21:22.540
Because, if you are a scientist, you must first verify,

21:23.258 --> 21:28.060
that whatever you are doing, you are doing in a proper way.

21:29.323 --> 21:33.140
I would say most of the people who have been now,

21:33.416 --> 21:36.740
going to different groups and churches and this and that,

21:36.940 --> 21:40.540
are thinking, “What are we doing?
Are we doing something sensible?”

21:43.032 --> 21:47.500
What have we being doing?
What did our forefathers do? Is it correct?

21:47.950 --> 21:53.020
Did it lead us anywhere or did we lead others anywhere?

21:53.220 --> 21:55.434
Why not ask this question?

21:56.106 --> 21:59.220
You see, nowadays, I have seen some people,

21:59.512 --> 22:03.397
sit down and plan out how to make
it more interesting for people to come.

22:03.597 --> 22:07.504
I mean, they may start,
for example, a discotheque in a church

22:07.704 --> 22:10.420
or anything, to make it more entertaining!

22:11.081 --> 22:14.460
I mean, is that the way you are going to reach God?

22:15.937 --> 22:20.820
That could be the attitude of any
sect which is not yet connected with God!

22:22.156 --> 22:28.220
That’s why I would say that,
we, all of us, have to face ourselves

22:28.643 --> 22:33.220
and ask ourselves honestly,
“Are we connected to God or not?”

22:34.950 --> 22:38.340
Now, how are we to know whether we are connected or not?

22:38.857 --> 22:41.900
I mean if you believe you are
already connected I have nothing to say!

22:42.552 --> 22:46.302
Because this argument can,

22:47.005 --> 22:50.860
take me away to such an extent
that I will have no time for others!

22:51.255 --> 22:56.098
The other day one gentleman took half an
hour just arguing and I had to work you know!

22:56.426 --> 23:02.020
And he kept me busy very selfishly and I said, “Now will
you please stop it and come and see me some other time!”

23:02.225 --> 23:04.303
And the others were all waiting!

23:05.640 --> 23:09.380
So we have to find out how far,

23:12.369 --> 23:17.220
do we know that we are connected to God.

23:18.783 --> 23:21.420
How are we going to find out,

23:23.520 --> 23:28.312
that is very, very simple. Very simple it is.

23:28.513 --> 23:33.138
How do you find out that this is receiving my mouth,

23:34.364 --> 23:37.780
My mouth piece that it is receiving my sound?

23:39.089 --> 23:42.200
That on the other side a person can hear;

23:42.479 --> 23:44.740
that means this is working alright.

23:46.932 --> 23:51.540
Now if I ask a question and that person can answer it,

23:51.763 --> 23:54.900
that means he is listening to
me and this is working alright.

23:57.513 --> 24:02.020
Now supposing my talking on this mic,

24:02.922 --> 24:08.265
is giving some recording there, say on a graph,

24:10.640 --> 24:13.350
and when that person asks the question,

24:13.929 --> 24:18.180
my answer again goes in the
graph which answers his question,

24:18.735 --> 24:22.636
then he will definitely believe that the
connection is there. Isn’t it? It’s a simple thing.

24:22.837 --> 24:25.037
That’s the way we do it everyday.

24:28.261 --> 24:31.140
There is no question of blind faith.

24:32.253 --> 24:34.560
So when your hands speak,

24:35.160 --> 24:37.537
you ask a question, it’s very simple.

24:37.737 --> 24:41.260
You see, for people it has to be something very serious!

24:42.248 --> 24:45.188
Oh, you must discuss it

24:45.388 --> 24:47.475
and talk in a very serious manner!

24:47.675 --> 24:51.882
The whole is thing is extremely serious as if
there is a big operation is going to take place:

24:52.082 --> 24:55.320
your stomachs are going to be cut out
and something is going to be pushed into it

24:55.521 --> 24:58.381
and then your Realisation is going to be worked out!

24:58.582 --> 25:01.620
But look at the flowers how they become the fruit.

25:02.455 --> 25:04.624
And how did you become a human being?

25:04.824 --> 25:07.244
Without any seriousness about it!

25:07.445 --> 25:12.256
Of course, it is not frivolous, but it is cheerful!

25:12.457 --> 25:16.580
And the whole thing, if you
understand, that this operation,

25:17.425 --> 25:20.500
is happening because you are made for it,

25:21.317 --> 25:23.317
because,

25:26.004 --> 25:28.088
you are built-in for it.

25:28.288 --> 25:30.859
All these things are within yourself!

25:31.510 --> 25:37.134
Just it is a matter of connecting you to the mains.

25:37.697 --> 25:43.020
And when that thing has to happen it should be the simplest

25:43.255 --> 25:49.355
because you have already reached a certain point,
only from this point you have to go one step forward.

25:50.715 --> 25:55.582
For that you need not spend thousands
of years writing books and this and that.

25:56.223 --> 26:00.222
But people can’t understand.
They have a big objection that,

26:00.423 --> 26:05.315
“How Sahaja Yoga is just
available to people who just come there,

26:05.515 --> 26:09.820
their Kundalini rises and they just
get Realisation?” I say, “Why not?”

26:10.170 --> 26:15.500
According to them you must read
some books on law, income tax, everything

26:15.887 --> 26:19.582
and then find out about God, ultimately.

26:19.783 --> 26:25.380
Or maybe you should belong to some union or
something, to political party and all that you should do,

26:25.580 --> 26:30.525
and then if you come to Sahaja Yoga,
then you are rightly place for Sahaja Yog.

26:30.758 --> 26:32.558
It’s not!

26:33.619 --> 26:36.780
What books do we read for our breathing?

26:38.381 --> 26:43.580
What knowledge do we have for our breathing?
Nothing. We breath, that’s all! Isn’t it? Simple as that!

26:44.108 --> 26:48.946
In the same way your
Realisation, is absolutely living and simple.

26:49.146 --> 26:54.660
For that, you don’t have to waste
your energy on all these artificial things.

26:55.203 --> 26:58.420
It’s a living process of a living God.

27:01.227 --> 27:03.817
And then it is to be verified.

27:04.018 --> 27:06.648
So as Mohammed has said, correctly,

27:07.060 --> 27:09.500
that, “Your hands will speak.”

27:09.700 --> 27:11.420
Means what?

27:12.590 --> 27:14.490
To be very frank,

27:15.315 --> 27:18.420
I must say I am very fortunate, compared to all of them,

27:18.620 --> 27:21.540
because in modern times you cannot crucify me.

27:22.197 --> 27:24.100
And Mohammed Sahib,

27:24.300 --> 27:28.660
was given poison and tortured
all his life. That won’t happen to me.

27:30.622 --> 27:34.420
You cannot cut short my life as you did that of Christ.

27:36.016 --> 27:40.112
In four years what could he do to these fishermen?

27:40.312 --> 27:43.260
What could he tell them? Four years is nothing!

27:43.655 --> 27:47.540
I was working on seven British,

27:47.952 --> 27:50.155
intelligent people,

27:51.217 --> 27:53.740
for four years – struggling with them –

27:54.092 --> 27:58.020
so what are four years for a person like Christ?

27:59.826 --> 28:02.900
Whatever he tried to say, in a nutshell,

28:05.779 --> 28:07.940
has to be explained.

28:09.015 --> 28:12.340
We must find out some other methods by which,

28:13.608 --> 28:15.700
it can be complimented.

28:16.233 --> 28:20.045
But anybody who says you have to go
to some other books to find out about him –

28:20.245 --> 28:22.940
oh – they will be very angry!

28:23.840 --> 28:27.178
They will not have it. They will have
their own mental projections about it

28:27.378 --> 28:30.300
and they’ll produce it
before you saying, “See! This is it!”

28:31.238 --> 28:35.420
And that’s how people are
surprised why none of them are near him

28:36.732 --> 28:40.226
how they lead such a horrible life and call themselves,

28:40.683 --> 28:44.062
the followers of Christ or
followers of Mohammed or followers,

28:44.262 --> 28:47.620
of any other great incarnations on this earth.

28:48.651 --> 28:52.020
The reason is there is no relationship,

28:54.120 --> 28:57.140
there is no rapport.

28:58.271 --> 29:02.260
If there was there would have been no problems

29:02.615 --> 29:07.060
because they are all related
to each other. As Christ has said,

29:07.727 --> 29:12.180
“Those who are not against me
are with me.” And who are those?

29:12.961 --> 29:15.980
I mean you didn’t give him a chance to talk much

29:16.545 --> 29:20.660
and whatever he has said, he has tried to point out,

29:20.860 --> 29:24.791
as much as possible, what is going to happen in the future.

29:25.047 --> 29:27.260
He has talked of the future.

29:27.499 --> 29:32.140
He has said, “I’ll send you a
counsellor, I’ll send you a redeemer.”

29:32.803 --> 29:37.365
He has talked about this, but
what about looking out for that?

29:37.566 --> 29:39.379
Instead of that people are satisfied:

29:39.579 --> 29:43.941
Sunday morning, get ready, go to
church, come back home – finished!

29:44.934 --> 29:48.900
Then they get angry, then become communist!

29:50.637 --> 29:54.462
They think if this is hell, the other
is heaven! That’s equally the same!

29:54.663 --> 29:56.663
No difference at all.

29:58.460 --> 30:01.940
Deny God! By denying God are you going to find him out?

30:03.679 --> 30:07.940
Like a lady who says, “I love my husband,”
and goes for a divorce! Something like that.

30:08.141 --> 30:09.702
It’s absurd.

30:09.903 --> 30:13.412
If you love your God and you want to find him out

30:13.613 --> 30:15.786
then how can you deny Him?

30:16.050 --> 30:19.740
Alright, some people are wrong but you should find Him!

30:20.894 --> 30:25.482
Within you resides this great
power of God, which is the Spirit;

30:25.682 --> 30:29.581
which is described by all
the great scriptures of the world.

30:31.319 --> 30:35.700
Once you get to that Spirit, once that light,

30:36.561 --> 30:42.300
the great light of your own Spirit
shines in your attention, you are amazed!

30:42.825 --> 30:44.917
The whole thing gets integrated:

30:45.117 --> 30:48.700
your physical, mental, emotional being gets integrated.

30:49.150 --> 30:52.460
That’s how you get rid of your diseases automatically.

30:55.614 --> 30:59.460
Your Spirit does everything. People sometimes thank me.

30:59.660 --> 31:03.020
I said, “What is there to thank
me? I mean I haven’t done anything.”

31:03.785 --> 31:08.498
You are like a lamp and there is the Spirit,

31:08.698 --> 31:14.500
only the Spirit has come into your attention by
Kundalini awakening, which is your own Mother.

31:15.822 --> 31:19.580
You can do it the same way, you can do the same work.

31:19.780 --> 31:22.300
So there is nothing to thank me about it.

31:23.392 --> 31:25.700
And when it happens,

31:26.571 --> 31:31.020
you become collectively
conscious, again I say – you become!

31:34.119 --> 31:39.860
The other day I had a phone
call from someone who is a patient,

31:40.236 --> 31:44.700
and one of the Sahaja Yogis
has been able to cure that patient.

31:46.427 --> 31:51.239
The lady, she’s from India – she said,

31:51.675 --> 31:56.860
“Mother I have been to many
sadhus and saints and real saints and seers,

31:58.219 --> 32:03.540
but none of them do any upkaar,”
means they do not try to help us out,

32:03.873 --> 32:07.922
“See, we have to go, touch their
feet and all that, but nobody does this!

32:08.123 --> 32:11.789
And look at this Sahaja Yogi, for
not paying a single pie to him, nothing,

32:11.989 --> 32:16.060
he comes every second day and he’s cured me completely!

32:16.798 --> 32:18.798
And he’s enjoying that.

32:19.000 --> 32:22.940
He doesn’t ask for money, he
doesn’t take tea, he just comes home and

32:23.140 --> 32:27.700
tells me how to do it and just it has
awakened now and he’s trying to establish it.”

32:27.900 --> 32:31.940
Nobody does that! If you go to
them they’ll give you a big lecture:

32:32.811 --> 32:35.890
“Don’t do this and don’t do that!”

32:36.717 --> 32:42.256
All kinds of commandments they
come out with, but they never help us.

32:43.276 --> 32:45.810
Upkaar has no translation,

32:46.010 --> 32:51.058
in English language, I’m sorry to say, but it
means ‘gracious helping’ in the concrete form.

32:51.259 --> 32:55.500
You see graciousness is also we can say, “I’m gracious”

32:55.840 --> 32:58.300
but may not do anything about it, you see.

32:58.500 --> 33:01.500
I could be gracious without doing anything about it.

33:01.701 --> 33:03.700
I can say I’m compassionate

33:04.259 --> 33:06.743
but may not do anything out of compassion, you see.

33:06.944 --> 33:11.680
Or you can say that, “Oh, she’s very
compassionate!” But what has she done?

33:12.398 --> 33:16.700
It’s a concrete thing that you do
out of your compassion; is upkaar.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.940
And that’s what she said and I was amazed really:

33:21.140 --> 33:23.399
what are they doing all these saints

33:23.679 --> 33:26.300
who are such great born-realised souls.

33:26.500 --> 33:30.580
In India we have many saints, you will be
surprised; everywhere I find there are saints.

33:31.073 --> 33:35.573
They are quite satisfied with themselves but
they are not bothered that they have to help others:

33:35.774 --> 33:38.820
and a gracious help;

33:39.137 --> 33:41.086
which could be health,

33:41.492 --> 33:44.420
could be their well-being,

33:44.741 --> 33:47.700
could be their family relationships,

33:48.641 --> 33:51.340
or could be their spiritual ascent.

33:51.728 --> 33:53.715
But spiritual ascent is the main thing!

33:53.915 --> 33:57.580
If that happens everything works out automatically.

33:57.892 --> 34:01.180
Like when the light is put in, you see everything clearly.

34:01.380 --> 34:04.860
In the same way, once this
thing happens, it should work out.

34:07.880 --> 34:10.736
I think there is no compulsion of anything.

34:10.936 --> 34:13.660
Whatever type they are they can come to Sahaja Yoga.

34:15.031 --> 34:17.100
Drunkards have come to my programme

34:17.300 --> 34:21.020
and shouted at me at the top of their voices; they have.

34:21.659 --> 34:26.460
Fanatics have come to my
programme with a Bible, about to hit on my head!

34:28.901 --> 34:33.220
People have come from all
walks of life and all types of people.

34:33.420 --> 34:37.780
But once they are changed they know this is the Spirit

34:37.980 --> 34:40.020
and this is what we have to have.

34:41.829 --> 34:45.340
If you are a seeker you get it much faster.

34:46.009 --> 34:50.268
If you are a superficial person you will
come only for sickness or something, then your -

34:50.468 --> 34:54.460
you will feel - curiosity will be
awakened, then you will become a seeker

34:54.660 --> 34:57.340
and ultimately you will get your Realisation.

34:57.540 --> 34:59.458
It takes time for some people like that.

34:59.658 --> 35:04.380
If you are already conditioned and
you have fixed ideas about yourself,

35:04.797 --> 35:08.580
that God is like this or God is like that,

35:09.110 --> 35:12.580
then you have to come out of it a little bit, gradually;

35:13.055 --> 35:16.260
and then you see for yourself what it is.

35:17.644 --> 35:20.500
Sitting in my car, if I had been thinking about this hall,

35:20.700 --> 35:24.580
I would have never have been
able to see what sort of a hall it is

35:25.331 --> 35:28.220
but when I came in I can see it clearly!

35:28.641 --> 35:30.500
But supposing,

35:30.922 --> 35:35.580
I was stuck up with the ideas that I
had about God or Realisation or anything,

35:35.936 --> 35:37.940
I would have been just there,

35:38.256 --> 35:41.100
not here to see what it is like.

35:41.967 --> 35:44.453
So all these things, all the blockages,

35:44.653 --> 35:48.820
do retard the speed of Realisation, no doubt,

35:49.878 --> 35:53.900
but all of you have to have
Realisation because the time has come.

35:54.100 --> 35:55.820
This is the special time

35:56.154 --> 35:59.420
when all of you must have your Realisation.

36:00.733 --> 36:05.211
What will happen if you do not have
your Realisation? Many people ask me.

36:07.492 --> 36:11.300
I cannot see any answer to the collapse of human beings,

36:11.500 --> 36:13.620
collapse of all this Creation,

36:13.820 --> 36:16.940
if people do not get their Realisation.

36:17.372 --> 36:20.300
This is the complete emancipation of human beings!

36:21.669 --> 36:24.980
All the diseases of the world are because of that,

36:25.618 --> 36:29.140
all the political, economic problems are because of that.

36:30.563 --> 36:33.740
All other calamities are because of that.

36:34.213 --> 36:38.100
The nature is trying to teach you, make you understand.

36:38.300 --> 36:41.926
Your own temperament is reacting against you.

36:42.774 --> 36:44.581
You are restless.

36:44.852 --> 36:47.740
The whole atmosphere looks so dark.

36:48.516 --> 36:52.056
That is the time when you start looking out for God.

36:52.341 --> 36:55.521
If everything is fine, nobody is bothered about God!

36:56.138 --> 37:00.260
These modern times, called
as Kali Yuga, are the best suited

37:01.241 --> 37:05.806
and that’s why many people who are seeking God are born

37:07.090 --> 37:11.740
on this earth and they are
a special category of the seeking.

37:11.940 --> 37:17.366
They are called as ‘seekers’ but how
many of them know what they have to seek?

37:18.150 --> 37:22.346
They stick on to things which are absolutely absurd,

37:22.546 --> 37:25.500
which has nothing to do with God.

37:26.973 --> 37:30.599
Like a guru says that you can seek God

37:30.799 --> 37:37.635
through sex relationships is absolutely wrong. You cannot.

37:41.562 --> 37:45.100
Because it is available to everyone!

37:45.615 --> 37:51.591
Every person has got it,

37:52.475 --> 37:57.904
every animal has got it and the more
you are an animal the more you become that.

37:58.855 --> 38:01.824
You need not run away from it, no doubt,

38:02.024 --> 38:05.460
but you must have a sane, proper life,

38:05.720 --> 38:09.300
a sane married life, a balanced life,

38:10.451 --> 38:12.180
then it works out.

38:12.380 --> 38:16.468
As you will grow in Sahaja Yoga then
you will see how much harm it is done,

38:16.668 --> 38:19.940
to us, to our innocence,

38:20.231 --> 38:25.500
the way we have played around with our sex life.

38:25.700 --> 38:27.871
It does harm us.

38:28.071 --> 38:31.317
It can be seen in nature also

38:31.518 --> 38:37.018
how we suffer from diseases and other kinds of problems,

38:37.698 --> 38:40.220
because we have lost our innocence.

38:40.924 --> 38:43.460
It’s alright to say, “What’s wrong?!”

38:44.307 --> 38:46.580
But no, there is wrong;

38:46.780 --> 38:48.317
believe me there is wrong.

38:48.550 --> 38:51.860
But before Realisation I
don’t want to say anything about it.

38:52.060 --> 38:56.660
For example, people would say, “What’s
wrong in smoking?” when I first came to England.

38:56.860 --> 38:59.300
Now they know it’s wrong.

38:59.552 --> 39:02.379
Or about drinking, they know it’s wrong.

39:02.579 --> 39:08.180
But I don’t say, “You don’t drink, you
don’t smoke, or don’t have all those habits.”

39:08.479 --> 39:10.199
I don’t say that.

39:10.721 --> 39:14.860
You just get your Realisation, then I will talk to you.

39:16.568 --> 39:18.980
Before Realisation all questions start,

39:19.180 --> 39:21.780
“Why not this? Why Mother said so?”

39:22.126 --> 39:24.100
“Why this?” and “Why that?”

39:26.251 --> 39:28.740
But once you get your Realisation

39:29.274 --> 39:32.860
then you don’t say that, you just give it up.

39:33.652 --> 39:37.620
Today only somebody, before coming here,
came to see me and he said he has given up drinking.

39:37.820 --> 39:39.113
I said, “How?”

39:39.314 --> 39:43.460
He came from India and he thought he
was a Englishman, you see now he must drink!

39:43.913 --> 39:46.939
And he used to drink everything.
He became an expert on that, you see.

39:47.140 --> 39:50.541
He was about to write a book on
that! I mean, there’s a science of it!

39:50.741 --> 39:52.523
I said, “How is it you have given up?”

39:52.724 --> 39:55.994
He said, “Mother, I just can’t
drink now anymore! What to do?”

39:56.194 --> 40:00.260
He just laughed. I said, “Can’t drink
at all?” He said, “Just can’t drink Mother!”

40:00.460 --> 40:06.140
I said, “What happens?” He said, “Oh, I feel
horrible! It smells like this and smells like that and smells.”

40:08.401 --> 40:13.820
I think he gets the smell of the molasses
or something, from where it has originated.

40:15.365 --> 40:17.411
I don’t say anything about those things.

40:17.612 --> 40:21.900
Many people have told me that, “Mother, in
Sahaja Yoga you cannot come if you are drinking.”

40:22.100 --> 40:26.580
No, no, you drink a lot. Even if you
have got drunk today doesn’t matter to me

40:28.554 --> 40:31.728
because once your Spirit is
awakened it will look after you.

40:31.928 --> 40:34.100
You have that thing within you.

40:34.300 --> 40:38.481
That correcting point is within you.
That joy-giving point is within you.

40:38.681 --> 40:42.620
That emancipating point is within you.

40:42.820 --> 40:46.580
That ennobling point is
within you. I don’t have to tell you.

40:46.780 --> 40:50.923
Just awaken it and you will be
amazed how powerful you became.

40:51.095 --> 40:53.321
All your habits drop out.

40:56.861 --> 41:00.540
All your slavery drops out

41:00.822 --> 41:02.980
and you become a free man,

41:03.180 --> 41:06.740
absolutely powerful to handle yourself the way you like.

41:08.247 --> 41:10.585
This is what it is, the Self-realisation.

41:10.785 --> 41:14.620
It should act, within and without.

41:14.970 --> 41:20.220
It acts within you and also without – on other people.

41:20.915 --> 41:23.100
If there is a Realised-soul,

41:23.942 --> 41:26.661
he acts on others – automatically.

41:26.862 --> 41:29.936
He need not speak, he need not say anything.

41:30.136 --> 41:34.180
But it has an effect of making that person relaxed

41:34.380 --> 41:38.940
and see a balanced view of the whole thing.

41:41.351 --> 41:45.940
Things change very fast for a Sahaja Yogi,

41:46.140 --> 41:51.983
once he knows the technique of
manoeuvring this wonderful power.

41:52.631 --> 41:55.728
First you have to get it, then establish it

41:55.928 --> 41:58.300
and then to know how to arrange it

41:59.045 --> 42:00.815
and organise it.

42:01.016 --> 42:05.166
Once you know that, you yourself become
the guru. There is no need to have these gurus,

42:05.366 --> 42:11.060
for whom you have to pay such a lot of money and
sell your houses and take out your children from schools.

42:11.494 --> 42:16.494
You become the guru. But you
become the guru who is a real guru.

42:16.635 --> 42:21.354
The guru who knows all about oneself,

42:22.740 --> 42:24.820
all about the Divine Power

42:25.020 --> 42:30.904
and all about the real knowledge of how to impart,

42:31.104 --> 42:35.368
this joy of Spirit.

42:37.634 --> 42:42.980
I think this lecture has to be stopped now

42:43.275 --> 42:48.020
because I have spoken so many times,

42:48.220 --> 42:53.500
even in Hampstead; and much more in Caxton Hall.

42:55.857 --> 43:01.140
And there are people here who are
great Sahaja Yogis sitting down before me,

43:01.340 --> 43:06.260
who look just like you, but if you see them and
talk to them you will find out they are a different type.

43:07.208 --> 43:13.692
It’s difficult also for anybody to accept
anybody of the same clan as a guru – very difficult.

43:14.100 --> 43:18.782
So we had to send some English
Sahaja Yogis to India to talk about,

43:18.983 --> 43:23.421
Sahaja Yoga because if I talk they
say, “Oh! She’s from our corner, you see.

43:24.079 --> 43:28.260
I saw her the other day in the car,” or something.

43:31.460 --> 43:35.420
But they are Sahaja Yogis and you all can become that.

43:35.620 --> 43:38.900
There is nothing like superiority or inferiority.

43:39.178 --> 43:42.780
There’s nothing like feeling in any way less or more.

43:42.980 --> 43:46.316
You are just going to become. You are just ready.

43:46.516 --> 43:49.900
They have come earlier so they have
got it and now you are going to get it.

43:50.263 --> 43:53.700
These flowers will become fruit tomorrow

43:53.900 --> 43:57.020
and the others will become the day
after. What difference does it make?

43:57.220 --> 44:01.422
Because in the Realm of God there
is nothing like time, it is eternal life.

44:01.732 --> 44:07.000
It is eternal life where you
enter, where there is no time, no space.

44:07.200 --> 44:09.820
And that is the life one has to achieve.

44:10.020 --> 44:13.660
But not by just lecturing or taking a lecture in,

44:13.860 --> 44:19.899
or thinking that Mataji is quite a good lecturer or bad
lecturer – whatever you may think – that’s not the way.

44:20.100 --> 44:22.740
The time has come of actualisation.

44:22.940 --> 44:25.420
Of really getting it within you.

44:25.654 --> 44:29.340
That’s what it is. Of course for this you can’t pay.

44:29.850 --> 44:35.460
You can’t pay for love. I mean, it’s very childish to say
but some people think that, “How can it be we cannot pay?”

44:35.660 --> 44:38.086
You don’t have to pay for it. You can’t pay.

44:38.286 --> 44:43.036
Payment means some sort of an
inferior understanding of the whole thing.

44:43.851 --> 44:49.701
This is Divine love. How much do these
flowers pay to God for making them into fruits?

44:49.858 --> 44:52.930
And how much did you pay to become a human being?

44:53.335 --> 44:55.681
How much do we pay for breathing?

44:55.882 --> 45:01.142
Maybe in London you are paying because you
have stopped all the air to come in! What to do?

45:01.275 --> 45:06.415
You have to pay for your own doing, for the
undoing of it you have to pay: that’s a different point.

45:06.798 --> 45:10.140
But otherwise everything is available to us free

45:10.340 --> 45:13.381
and God’s grace is available to us free. It has to be,

45:13.581 --> 45:17.581
because it is so vital it has to be free.

45:19.921 --> 45:25.327
The whole system of God’s working is is fantastic!

45:27.578 --> 45:32.197
When you become Sahaja Yogis
you will be amazed to know that His,

45:33.116 --> 45:35.007
television system,

45:35.208 --> 45:39.718
His intercommunication system, are so well developed

45:40.105 --> 45:44.123
that we cannot conceive with this mind

45:44.714 --> 45:48.525
how quick and efficient they are: they never fail.

45:48.725 --> 45:52.546
We may fail, but they never fail.

45:54.592 --> 45:58.780
For all of you who are here I am very much thankful

45:58.980 --> 46:03.177
that you have listened to me so carefully,

46:03.377 --> 46:07.140
but take your Realisation and then go.

46:07.340 --> 46:10.420
You have come here for
Realisation; take your Realisation and go.

46:10.620 --> 46:13.643
There is no fear of anything happening to you.

46:14.760 --> 46:19.900
If you belong to some cult or
to some group or to some ideas

46:20.100 --> 46:24.980
you must know that you have to know yourself!

46:25.180 --> 46:29.609
Otherwise how will you know others? You are in a confusion.

46:29.828 --> 46:34.393
There are many people who come and fight for
some cults or things like that – I am surprised at them.

46:34.593 --> 46:40.739
Why are you supporting anyone which has not given
you anything? None of your powers are manifesting?

46:40.940 --> 46:44.803
Have they given you some money? No! We
have given them money! Then why are you,

46:45.003 --> 46:46.786
paying money to fight for them?

46:46.987 --> 46:50.420
If there is a lawyer, if he
fights for you, you have to pay him!

46:50.620 --> 46:53.587
Have you seen any lawyer who will fight for you,

46:53.788 --> 46:56.145
for whom you have not given money?

46:56.345 --> 47:00.293
But the cult business and other things are such,

47:00.493 --> 47:06.417
that you are so brainwashed
that you think it’s your duty to fight.

47:07.034 --> 47:11.220
But where are you? Have you
known yourself? Do you know yourself?

47:11.420 --> 47:14.279
Do you know your relationship with you and the whole?

47:14.480 --> 47:17.652
Do you know your relationship with yourself and this,

47:17.853 --> 47:23.060
cult of yours which has put you
into a group? You cannot have a group.

47:23.426 --> 47:27.420
You cannot form into groups. It’s a universal thing.

47:27.620 --> 47:32.620
That cannot be formed into an
organisation. It cannot be organised.

47:33.117 --> 47:38.642
If it is universal, if it has to do with
the Divine love, you cannot organise.

47:38.842 --> 47:42.367
Only if it is something human,
which is dead, you can organise it.

47:42.567 --> 47:47.300
Alright, do what you like! You have
secretaries, president, this that and the other.

47:47.747 --> 47:51.153
But anything that is living, you cannot organise.

47:51.353 --> 47:54.208
If you try to organise it dies.

47:54.409 --> 47:58.551
And that is why one should understand God’s love,

47:58.751 --> 48:01.687
that flows sometimes as the sap in a tree;

48:01.887 --> 48:07.068
which goes to all the places, from
the roots it comes and goes all over,

48:07.268 --> 48:12.079
gives it’s love to the tree, to the bark,

48:12.815 --> 48:14.815
to the thorns,

48:15.188 --> 48:19.580
to the leaves to the flowers and ultimately to the fruit.

48:19.780 --> 48:21.836
It doesn’t settle down into one.

48:22.036 --> 48:27.374
It doesn’t form a group, otherwise the whole tree dies

48:27.575 --> 48:30.167
and also that group dies with it.

48:30.367 --> 48:34.595
If the tree cannot live how can that group,

48:34.795 --> 48:37.562
of cells exist?

48:38.731 --> 48:42.140
Also, as you have seen in life,

48:42.434 --> 48:48.060
in the cases of cancer, one cell starts growing,

48:48.260 --> 48:51.340
it starts growing big and big and big.

48:51.540 --> 48:55.034
When it starts growing big it becomes very big

48:55.235 --> 48:58.909
and whosoever it touches, it forms a group with that.

48:59.109 --> 49:03.626
It becomes malignant. With
that it tries to overpower others.

49:03.826 --> 49:06.556
You cannot overpower anyone with love.

49:06.756 --> 49:09.992
You do not want to overpower anyone. Why should you?

49:10.192 --> 49:15.300
There is no need to aggress anyone in
this, nor to take any aggression from anyone.

49:16.037 --> 49:21.140
It is the most balanced personality that you develop.

49:21.340 --> 49:24.093
Because love cannot be forced on anyone.

49:24.293 --> 49:27.140
You have to ask for it otherwise it doesn’t work out.

49:27.340 --> 49:30.462
You cannot force Sahaja Yoga on
anyone. Supposing you come and tell me,

49:30.662 --> 49:34.540
“Mother my son hasn’t got Realisation,
give him Realisation!” I cannot!

49:34.740 --> 49:37.234
I cannot do it. It has to work out.

49:37.434 --> 49:41.380
Even my own son I may not be able to give Realisation too.

49:41.580 --> 49:46.918
If he’s not getting it, he’s not getting
it. You cannot give a certificate to that!

49:47.119 --> 49:51.220
But the way people come, with the attitude, is as if,

49:52.579 --> 49:54.980
there can be an aggression

49:55.242 --> 49:57.460
or there can be a demand.

49:57.757 --> 50:00.431
I am sorry, you cannot demand it!

50:00.632 --> 50:04.980
You have to get it, achieve it and deserve it, in a way.

50:05.181 --> 50:09.749
And that deserving comes through your only one

50:09.949 --> 50:12.622
and only one quality:

50:12.822 --> 50:16.191
that is the true seeking.

50:18.605 --> 50:21.381
If you are not truly seeking,

50:21.743 --> 50:25.243
then you will always run
after things which are not truthful.

50:25.478 --> 50:29.300
If you are truly seeking,
then you will discard all that is,

50:29.500 --> 50:32.203
not the Truth and come to the Truth.

50:32.403 --> 50:35.324
If so, it works out,

50:37.276 --> 50:39.500
very well and very fast.

50:40.011 --> 50:41.945
So may God bless you all.

50:42.146 --> 50:44.533
Those who want to have Realisation,

50:45.475 --> 50:49.209
have to be settled down a little bit

50:49.860 --> 50:55.220
and they have to just put their hands towards me like that.

50:56.322 --> 51:01.593
Before that I don’t mind if you
want to ask any questions. I don’t mind.

51:01.793 --> 51:04.761
But one should not ask questions

51:04.962 --> 51:09.300
in such a way that you disturb the whole audience,

51:09.618 --> 51:15.328
you take away all their possibilities of
getting Realisation, and try to show off.

51:15.940 --> 51:18.512
And if you have to give a big lecture it is better

51:18.712 --> 51:22.720
you again hire this hall and get
the people and give them a lecture.

51:22.920 --> 51:27.856
But here people have come, 99%, to get Realisation.

51:28.056 --> 51:31.486
So one should not be like a
dog in the manger policy, you see.

51:31.687 --> 51:34.011
If you don’t want to have it – alright, don’t have it.

51:34.211 --> 51:37.123
You can go away. As I told you I cannot force on you.

51:37.324 --> 51:40.357
I have not to achieve anything or gain anything from you.

51:40.558 --> 51:44.140
If you have to gain your own
Self-realisation, you’d better have it.

51:44.340 --> 51:48.540
But if you just are here to use
this audience for your own purpose

51:48.740 --> 51:50.740
then that’s not fair,

51:51.063 --> 51:54.572
that’s not fair at all, because then you can go

51:54.772 --> 51:59.500
and you can again hire this hall and address to the people.

51:59.700 --> 52:05.210
I have seen, also, people standing outside and
shouting and saying, “Oh, come to our organisation.”

52:05.410 --> 52:09.180
Then why not advertise in the paper and get them for that?

52:09.380 --> 52:12.817
This is not the way to be fair to anyone.

52:13.017 --> 52:15.237
We would not do that to any organisation.

52:15.437 --> 52:18.212
For example, if there is an organisation

52:18.413 --> 52:22.260
which is working out it’s
methods – alright, let them work it out.

52:22.460 --> 52:27.500
We’ll not go and visit that organisation and go on
saying that, “This is wrong, that is wrong,” except,

52:27.700 --> 52:32.654
when there are people who belong to that
organisation who have come to Sahaja Yoga

52:32.854 --> 52:36.980
and have achieved something then they want
to tell others – that’s a different point altogether.

52:37.191 --> 52:42.780
But this is not fair and I would
request you that please don’t try to waste the,

52:43.050 --> 52:46.580
time of other people who are genuine, who are seeking.

52:46.780 --> 52:51.103
If you want to ask any nice, good
question, you are welcome; you should ask.

52:51.303 --> 52:54.580
I mean, I am open to all your
questioning, no doubt about it.

52:54.850 --> 52:56.650
Thank you very much.

52:59.857 --> 53:04.740
So, any questions please ask.
Somebody has to be here to communicate to me.

53:15.437 --> 53:17.860
Anyone has any questions?

53:29.738 --> 53:35.700
Alright! So just a simple thing
is to put your hands towards me.

53:35.900 --> 53:38.324
I am sure Graham must have told you about,

53:38.525 --> 53:41.420
these finger tips have got the five centres,

53:41.620 --> 53:46.180
and six and seven centres. These are
right and left sympathetic nervous systems,

53:46.380 --> 53:50.700
within us which have got these centres working here.

53:51.329 --> 53:55.460
Now, whatever I say, you need not believe in me altogether.

53:55.660 --> 53:59.360
But also should not deny me
because I am not doing anything to you.

53:59.560 --> 54:03.398
Just to expect something that will happen to you

54:03.598 --> 54:07.241
which I do not want to tell you
because, you see, people come with an attitude

54:07.441 --> 54:11.207
as if I am going to mesmerise them
and take away something from you.

54:11.407 --> 54:13.697
And then they think, “Oh, why this and why that?”

54:13.897 --> 54:18.018
I do not want to take anything
from you whatsoever, take it from me.

54:18.686 --> 54:20.940
And I do not want anything from you.

54:21.140 --> 54:25.103
Only thing is, if you cooperate
with me a little, it will work out.

54:25.303 --> 54:29.679
But if you do not want to have it it’s better
to leave the hall and leave others in peace.

54:29.880 --> 54:31.700
I would request you to do that.

54:31.900 --> 54:34.420
Now put your, just, hands like this. Straight like this.

54:34.620 --> 54:38.500
Simple hands, like this, and close your eyes.

54:39.755 --> 54:42.796
And please don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

54:42.996 --> 54:45.981
Before doing that I hope you take out your shoes

54:46.181 --> 54:49.060
because the Mother Earth helps us a lot

54:49.580 --> 54:52.660
and we have a nice wooden floor we can do it.

55:01.953 --> 55:04.401
Please keep your eyes shut, that’s very important.

55:04.601 --> 55:08.820
Don’t open your eyes because when
the Kundalini rises above the Agnya,

55:09.020 --> 55:11.980
it does not rise because,

55:15.490 --> 55:19.380
if your eyes are open it does not rise.

55:34.842 --> 55:36.488
This is your own.

55:37.549 --> 55:41.300
Everything is within yourself, which you have to get.

55:44.312 --> 55:47.972
As it is, in every Western country I have seen,

55:48.172 --> 55:52.700
the first blockage is that everyone feels guilty.

55:53.890 --> 55:56.980
Now I have to again request you not to feel guilty.

55:57.475 --> 55:59.220
There’s nothing to feel guilty.

55:59.420 --> 56:05.020
After all you are a human being means
you are at the epitome of the Creation of God,

56:06.072 --> 56:08.384
and what is there to feel guilty,

56:08.947 --> 56:13.031
when God is the ocean of forgiveness,

56:13.232 --> 56:17.420
ocean of compassion, ocean of love?

56:17.745 --> 56:21.140
Then what is there to feel guilty about? For what?

56:21.838 --> 56:24.820
You just have to say, in your heart,

56:25.020 --> 56:27.199
at least thrice, genuinely,

56:27.399 --> 56:31.024
that, “Mother I am not Guilty.” Genuinely I say, again.

56:34.835 --> 56:39.900
Put the hands towards me and not
towards yourself or towards your hands.

56:40.100 --> 56:44.860
Straight please. And now,
just say, “Mother I am not guilty.”

56:46.053 --> 56:48.980
Please put them straight! On your lap will be alright.

56:49.180 --> 56:51.460
Be relaxed! Be relaxed!

56:53.051 --> 56:54.740
Be relaxed!

56:56.541 --> 57:01.700
There should be no tension about
anything. It will just work out. It is all within you.

57:01.900 --> 57:07.900
It is not going to take any time. And if you have
any diseases and troubles, as a result you will be cured.

59:01.625 --> 59:05.053
Please keep your eyes shut, because you see,

59:05.253 --> 59:09.900
it’s no question of curiosity or anything
but it has to work out. It’s very hot today.

01:01:06.657 --> 01:01:09.100
Now put your right hand, without opening your eyes,

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:12.473
please put it on the heart.

01:01:12.673 --> 01:01:17.340
Right had on the heart, without
opening your eyes. Please put it on the heart

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:22.916
and ask a question in your heart, a question –

01:01:23.116 --> 01:01:27.220
this is the establishment of the rapport – a question,

01:01:27.692 --> 01:01:31.980
“Mother am I the Spirit?”
Ask a question, “Am I the Spirit?”

01:01:34.161 --> 01:01:36.140
Right on the heart please.

01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:39.500
“Mother am I the Spirit?”

01:01:40.041 --> 01:01:43.438
Some have put it higher some
have put it lower so put it just,

01:01:43.639 --> 01:01:46.079
on the heart where you feel the beat.

01:01:47.188 --> 01:01:50.563
And please ask a question, “Mother am I the Spirit?”

01:01:55.079 --> 01:01:56.879
Which you are!

01:02:01.665 --> 01:02:03.740
“Am I the Atma?”

01:02:22.515 --> 01:02:26.740
Now put the same right hand on top of your head, on top,

01:02:27.955 --> 01:02:31.340
touching it in the centre of the fontanelle bone area,

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:35.680
where the fontanelle bone is,
where you had a soft bone in the head.

01:02:35.881 --> 01:02:39.940
Just it is little on the front side.

01:02:40.195 --> 01:02:45.461
It is more on the front side. Now press
it with your fingers, in the central parting.

01:02:45.661 --> 01:02:50.100
Press it with your fingers and turn it clockwise.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:53.020
I am telling you how to do it for yourself.

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:57.700
Press it hard and turn it clockwise with your fingers!

01:02:57.987 --> 01:03:00.340
Turn the scalp clockwise.

01:03:01.253 --> 01:03:06.880
Put your fingers in such a
way that they lie parallel to your,

01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:12.595
hair parting, same way.

01:03:14.142 --> 01:03:18.460
Now, raise your hand up on the head –

01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:20.820
higher –

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.020
and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

01:03:44.558 --> 01:03:47.827
Higher than your head then you will feel it.

01:03:49.275 --> 01:03:52.275
Some people will feel it in the
hand. Some people will feel it hot.

01:03:52.476 --> 01:03:56.089
You can put now your left hand,
without opening your eyes please,

01:03:56.289 --> 01:03:58.900
and put your left hand on top of your head

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.755
and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

01:04:01.956 --> 01:04:04.580
And right hand towards me, on your lap.

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:07.825
Please put your right hand towards me on your lap.

01:04:40.887 --> 01:04:44.887
Now see in your hands if it is cool breeze is coming now.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:20.406
Those who are getting the cool breeze raise your hands!

01:05:22.704 --> 01:05:24.514
So many new people!

01:05:25.180 --> 01:05:26.920
Raise them higher!

01:05:27.744 --> 01:05:29.244
Good.

01:05:29.688 --> 01:05:33.298
Slowly everybody will be
getting, slowly. Yes, may God bless you.

01:05:33.494 --> 01:05:36.501
Slowly everybody will be getting it, just keep it up!

01:05:36.705 --> 01:05:38.385
Just keep it on!

01:05:49.044 --> 01:05:51.144
Put down your hands please.

01:05:54.588 --> 01:05:58.220
Now, if you can open your eyes slowly.
