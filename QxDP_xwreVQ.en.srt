1997-1004 EP Navaratri Puja P2,
Cabella

2
01:29:04,591 --> 01:29:09,812
“Litany for the doom of Materasura”

3
01:29:10,013 --> 01:29:16,622
This is the world that feeds the Swiss
Banks’ Octopus.

4
01:29:16,873 --> 01:29:23,146
This is the world where too much
is not enough.

5
01:29:23,347 --> 01:29:28,343
This is the world where negativity
is a plus.

6
01:29:28,544 --> 01:29:36,267
This is the world where the saints
say: “Enough”.

7
01:29:52,426 --> 01:29:57,288
1. This is a world where 1.3 billion
people

8
01:29:57,489 --> 01:30:01,507
live on an income of less
than $1 a day

9
01:30:01,708 --> 01:30:06,553
and where the planet does not have
enough natural resources

10
01:30:06,754 --> 01:30:11,546
to sustain, at a worldwide scale,
the consumption pattern

11
01:30:11,747 --> 01:30:15,483
of Malaysia, leave alone America.

12
01:30:15,684 --> 01:30:17,497
PLEASE SHRI DURGA,

13
01:30:17,698 --> 01:30:22,322
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

14
01:30:22,523 --> 01:30:27,156
Om Twameva Sakshat

15
01:30:27,357 --> 01:30:34,905
Shri Durga Namoh Namaha.

16
01:30:35,106 --> 01:30:38,625
2. This is a world where ten per cent
of world trade

17
01:30:38,826 --> 01:30:44,007
is generated by drugs and narco-traffics,
or US$100 billion

18
01:30:44,208 --> 01:30:48,164
represents the amount that yearly
poisons mankind,

19
01:30:48,365 --> 01:30:51,328
while money laundering in Switzerland
and elsewhere

20
01:30:51,536 --> 01:30:53,960
has become a most prosperous
activity,

21
01:30:54,161 --> 01:30:57,788
reaching all levels of society.

22
01:30:57,989 --> 01:31:01,148
PLEASE SHRI RAKTABIJA VINASHINI,

23
01:31:01,349 --> 01:31:05,533
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

24
01:31:05,734 --> 01:31:10,653
Om Twameva Sakshat

25
01:31:10,854 --> 01:31:20,445
Shri Raktabija Vinashini
Namoh Namaha.

26
01:31:20,646 --> 01:31:24,513
3. This is a world where Wall Street
sucks the wealth

27
01:31:24,714 --> 01:31:28,130
from the working middle class
to bestow it upon the rich

28
01:31:28,331 --> 01:31:32,568
and where Walt Disney makes you
forget all about it.

29
01:31:32,769 --> 01:31:35,349
PLEASE SHRI KATYAYANI,

30
01:31:35,550 --> 01:31:39,737
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

31
01:31:39,938 --> 01:31:44,675
Om Twameva Sakshat

32
01:31:44,876 --> 01:31:54,464
Shri Katyayani Namoh Namaha.

33
01:31:54,665 --> 01:32:00,402
4. This is a world where an Egyptian
eats at MacDonalds in Cairo

34
01:32:00,603 --> 01:32:06,054
and a Chinese at Pizza Hut in Beijing,
because modern consumerism

35
01:32:06,255 --> 01:32:10,969
expresses the lowest common
denominator of world culture

36
01:32:11,170 --> 01:32:16,742
and erases the meaning of national
values and traditions.

37
01:32:16,943 --> 01:32:19,772
PLEASE SHRI SHAKAMBARI,

38
01:32:19,973 --> 01:32:24,085
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

39
01:32:24,286 --> 01:32:28,741
Om Twameva Sakshat

40
01:32:28,942 --> 01:32:36,571
Shri Shakambari Namoh Namaha.

41
01:32:36,772 --> 01:32:40,981
5. The new multinational entities are
experimenting with new forms

42
01:32:41,182 --> 01:32:46,030
of dictatorship, setting their production
sites in the developing world,

43
01:32:46,231 --> 01:32:49,468
reducing to slavery a subdued
working class

44
01:32:49,669 --> 01:32:54,022
and exploiting children on the altar
of productivity gains.

45
01:32:54,223 --> 01:32:56,350
PLEASE SHRI RAKSHAKARI,

46
01:32:56,551 --> 01:33:00,608
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

47
01:33:00,809 --> 01:33:05,163
Om Twameva Sakshat

48
01:33:05,364 --> 01:33:13,218
Shri Rakshakari Namoh Namaha.

49
01:33:13,489 --> 01:33:18,585
6. The globalization of production and
services allow a few global players

50
01:33:18,816 --> 01:33:22,639
to befool us and impose the rules
of their game

51
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:26,077
to the mass of unsuspecting
consumers.

52
01:33:26,278 --> 01:33:28,241
PLEASE SHRI BHIMADEVI,

53
01:33:28,442 --> 01:33:32,327
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

54
01:33:32,528 --> 01:33:36,836
Om Twameva Sakshat

55
01:33:37,037 --> 01:33:46,352
Shri Bhimadevi Namoh Namaha.

56
01:33:46,553 --> 01:33:51,008
7. Vast restructuration endeavours
are progressively leading

57
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:55,362
to the eradication of small and
medium-sized enterprises

58
01:33:55,563 --> 01:34:01,972
for the benefit of gigantic corporations
operating on a worldwide scale.

59
01:34:02,173 --> 01:34:03,736
PLEASE SHRI CHANDIKA,

60
01:34:03,937 --> 01:34:08,739
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

61
01:34:08,940 --> 01:34:13,626
Om Twameva Sakshat

62
01:34:13,827 --> 01:34:21,781
Shri Chandika Namoh Namaha.

63
01:34:21,982 --> 01:34:27,222
8. The gradual concentration of liquid
wealth in the hands of the super rich

64
01:34:27,423 --> 01:34:32,165
is marginalizing national sovereignty
and its elected officials,

65
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:37,011
and is imposing a titanic dimension
to the ruler-ship of money.

66
01:34:37,212 --> 01:34:38,999
PLEASE SHRI RAKSHASAGNI,

67
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:42,824
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

68
01:34:43,025 --> 01:34:47,918
Om Twameva Sakshat

69
01:34:48,119 --> 01:34:56,276
Shri Rakshasagni Namoh Namaha.

70
01:34:56,477 --> 01:34:59,636
9. Greed raised to the power 108

71
01:34:59,837 --> 01:35:03,251
means the pauperization of the world’s
middle class

72
01:35:03,467 --> 01:35:07,489
and outrageous wealth for
the remaining 10%.

73
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:10,327
PLEASE SHRI DAITYENDRA MARDINI,

74
01:35:10,528 --> 01:35:14,917
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

75
01:35:15,118 --> 01:35:19,541
Om Twameva Sakshat

76
01:35:19,742 --> 01:35:30,671
Shri Daityendra Mardini Namoh Namaha.

77
01:35:30,872 --> 01:35:35,741
10. The systematic elimination
of alternative economic solutions,

78
01:35:35,949 --> 01:35:41,902
unequal trade and financial manipulations
are challenging

79
01:35:42,104 --> 01:35:46,491
the equitable distribution of wealth
among the population of the world.

80
01:35:46,692 --> 01:35:48,478
PLEASE SHRI VAJRINI,

81
01:35:48,679 --> 01:35:51,968
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

82
01:35:52,169 --> 01:35:57,201
Om Twameva Sakshat

83
01:35:57,402 --> 01:36:04,510
Shri Vajrini Namoh Namaha.

84
01:36:04,711 --> 01:36:09,236
11. The deregulation of the financial
markets has opened wide the gates

85
01:36:09,437 --> 01:36:14,897
of Jurassic Park for the large financial
predators to roam about

86
01:36:15,098 --> 01:36:20,098
and thousands of billions of dollars are
created from nothing by speculators

87
01:36:20,299 --> 01:36:23,653
to feed their unlimited thirst for money
and power.

88
01:36:23,854 --> 01:36:26,148
PLEASE SHRI UGRACHANDESHWARI,

89
01:36:26,349 --> 01:36:30,843
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

90
01:36:31,044 --> 01:36:35,253
Om Twameva Sakshat

91
01:36:35,454 --> 01:36:44,778
Shri Ugrachandeshwari Namoh Namaha.

92
01:36:44,979 --> 01:36:49,736
12. The Swiss financial centre works
as a haven for rich tax-dodgers

93
01:36:49,937 --> 01:36:53,796
from developing countries, and diverts
needed capital

94
01:36:53,997 --> 01:36:58,022
from national investment programmes,
industrial infrastructures

95
01:36:58,223 --> 01:37:04,647
and social expenditure to inflate the stock
exchange of the developed countries.

96
01:37:04,848 --> 01:37:07,230
PLEASE SHRI UGRAPRABHA,

97
01:37:07,431 --> 01:37:11,472
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

98
01:37:11,673 --> 01:37:16,238
Om Twameva Sakshat

99
01:37:16,439 --> 01:37:25,684
Shri Ugraprabha Namoh Namaha.

100
01:37:25,885 --> 01:37:30,904
13. The trend of today’s mega mergers
is to marginalize the State,

101
01:37:31,105 --> 01:37:35,608
bypass national legislation, manipulate
the market,

102
01:37:35,809 --> 01:37:40,200
control the economy and, for all
practical purposes,

103
01:37:40,401 --> 01:37:45,619
finish off the social foundations
of real democracy.

104
01:37:45,820 --> 01:37:47,646
PLEASE SHRI MAHAKALI,

105
01:37:47,847 --> 01:37:52,532
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

106
01:37:52,733 --> 01:37:57,578
Om Twameva Sakshat

107
01:37:57,779 --> 01:38:06,907
Shri Mahakali Namoh Namaha.

108
01:38:07,108 --> 01:38:10,777
14. The lure and mirage of such a radical
concentration of wealth

109
01:38:10,978 --> 01:38:15,480
and power threatens to neutralize
all seeking of the Spirit,

110
01:38:15,681 --> 01:38:19,517
and the deafening roar of the triumph
of asuric materialism

111
01:38:19,718 --> 01:38:22,790
destroys the hope of millions
of seekers.

112
01:38:22,991 --> 01:38:24,736
PLEASE SHRI MAHAMAYA,

113
01:38:24,937 --> 01:38:29,233
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

114
01:38:29,434 --> 01:38:34,175
Om Twameva Sakshat

115
01:38:34,376 --> 01:38:42,867
Shri Mahamaya Namoh Namaha.

116
01:38:43,068 --> 01:38:47,576
15. The alliance of mafia, secretive
bankers and corrupt managers

117
01:38:47,777 --> 01:38:52,947
has infiltrated the world economy and
is threatening the ethics of collectivity

118
01:38:53,148 --> 01:38:59,563
which provides the foundation for the value
system of our entire civilization.

119
01:38:59,764 --> 01:39:01,830
PLEASE SHRI VIRATANGANA,

120
01:39:02,031 --> 01:39:06,748
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

121
01:39:06,949 --> 01:39:11,421
Om Twameva Sakshat

122
01:39:11,622 --> 01:39:21,534
Shri Viratangana Namoh Namaha.

123
01:39:21,735 --> 01:39:27,068
16. The enormous increase of financial
assets has siphoned cash money

124
01:39:27,269 --> 01:39:32,026
out of the real economy and channeled it
into the financial markets,

125
01:39:32,227 --> 01:39:35,424
building up a planetary gambling
casino

126
01:39:35,625 --> 01:39:39,723
where arbitrary currency speculation
can mount

127
01:39:39,924 --> 01:39:47,097
huge attacks against any country which
tries to follow socially-minded policies.

128
01:39:47,298 --> 01:39:49,806
PLEASE SHRI KHADGAPALINI,

129
01:39:50,007 --> 01:39:54,257
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

130
01:39:54,458 --> 01:39:58,679
Om Twameva Sakshat

131
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:07,027
Shri Khadgapalini Namoh Namaha.

132
01:40:07,228 --> 01:40:13,100
17. The etheric sophistication of financial
electronic circuits has created

133
01:40:13,301 --> 01:40:19,535
a virtual world where the immateriality
of money has become the sole reality.

134
01:40:19,736 --> 01:40:21,343
PLEASE SHRI VISHNUMAYA,

135
01:40:21,544 --> 01:40:26,110
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

136
01:40:26,311 --> 01:40:30,551
Om Twameva Sakshat

137
01:40:30,752 --> 01:40:38,947
Shri Vishnumaya Namoh Namaha.

138
01:40:39,148 --> 01:40:42,131
18. The progressive domination
of technology

139
01:40:42,332 --> 01:40:46,153
is sucking the blood of the farmer,
the artist and the potter,

140
01:40:46,361 --> 01:40:52,092
turning the man who works with his hands
into a permanently handicapped person.

141
01:40:52,293 --> 01:40:55,120
PLEASE SHRI DEVA KARYA SAMUDYATA,

142
01:40:55,321 --> 01:40:59,457
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

143
01:40:59,658 --> 01:41:04,097
Om Twameva Sakshat

144
01:41:04,298 --> 01:41:14,107
Shri Deva Karya Samudyata Namoh Namaha.

145
01:41:14,308 --> 01:41:19,405
19. The information highway leads
to the maya web of a virtual world

146
01:41:19,606 --> 01:41:24,346
where human attention is scattered,
desire is confused,

147
01:41:24,547 --> 01:41:30,018
truth is atomized and the soul
is thereby reduced to slavery.

148
01:41:30,219 --> 01:41:31,965
PLEASE SHRI RADHA,

149
01:41:32,166 --> 01:41:36,732
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

150
01:41:36,933 --> 01:41:41,168
Om Twameva Sakshat

151
01:41:41,369 --> 01:41:49,289
Shri Radha Namoh Namaha.

152
01:41:49,490 --> 01:41:53,269
20. Modern communication can become
a domestic [may that mean “demonic”] tool

153
01:41:53,470 --> 01:41:57,988
in the hands of a few media moguls
and opinion-making tycoons

154
01:41:58,189 --> 01:42:05,312
which are spreading their hedonistic
world views of power, money and sex.

155
01:42:05,513 --> 01:42:07,633
PLEASE SHRI SHUKRATMIKA,

156
01:42:07,817 --> 01:42:12,287
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

157
01:42:12,488 --> 01:42:16,927
Om Twameva Sakshat

158
01:42:17,128 --> 01:42:25,183
Shri Shukratmika Namoh Namaha.

159
01:42:25,384 --> 01:42:30,258
21. The Mlechas of Satan have infiltrated
the Internet global village

160
01:42:30,459 --> 01:42:34,228
to pour pornographic dirt and filth
within the nest

161
01:42:34,429 --> 01:42:40,231
of the family and to spread hell’s shadows
in the minds of helpless people.

162
01:42:40,432 --> 01:42:42,462
PLEASE SHRI NIRMALA KUMARI,

163
01:42:42,663 --> 01:42:47,078
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

164
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:52,219
Om Twameva Sakshat

165
01:42:52,420 --> 01:43:02,906
Shri Nirmala Kumari Namoh Namaha.

166
01:43:03,107 --> 01:43:08,119
Hail, salutations to the great Devi!
Aum, Amen.

167
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:12,371
May there be Auspiciousness,
Joy and Peace.

168
01:43:12,572 --> 01:43:15,612
May Thy Divine grace penetrate
the waters

169
01:43:15,813 --> 01:43:19,626
flowing from our mountains to the four
corners of Europe

170
01:43:19,827 --> 01:43:25,003
and spread the pure vibrations
of the Aquarian Age.

171
01:43:25,204 --> 01:43:28,920
Salutations to Thee Shri Mataji
Nirmala Devi Ji,

172
01:43:29,121 --> 01:43:32,944
the Resplendent One, O formidable
Avatar!

173
01:43:33,145 --> 01:43:37,543
We bow to Thee, most pleasing
yet most frightful,

174
01:43:37,744 --> 01:43:43,701
who has been approached by the Trimurtis
for the sake of protecting the universe.

175
01:43:43,902 --> 01:43:47,081
Today, in this festival of Navaratri,

176
01:43:47,282 --> 01:43:50,767
we chant the litany of Thy children
in Switzerland

177
01:43:50,968 --> 01:43:53,351
for the defeat of the foes
of the Spirit,

178
01:43:53,552 --> 01:44:01,417
and we offer to Thy glittering teeth
the new asuric forms of materialism.

179
01:44:01,618 --> 01:44:03,900
PLEASE SHRI RAKTADANTIKA,

180
01:44:04,101 --> 01:44:10,540
DESTROY THE EVIL FORCES THAT 
MATERIALISM CREATED.

181
01:44:10,741 --> 01:44:18,628
Om Twameva Sakshat

182
01:44:18,829 --> 01:44:25,485
Shri Kalki Sakshat

183
01:44:25,686 --> 01:44:33,685
Shri Sahastrara Swamini

184
01:44:33,886 --> 01:44:46,527
Moksha Pradayini Mataji

185
01:44:46,736 --> 01:45:01,027
Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namaha.

186
01:45:08,721 --> 01:45:19,106
It has been such a great treat for us,
not only entertainment,

187
01:45:20,696 --> 01:45:29,355
but the way for our future – how to move
and what to do.

188
01:45:29,556 --> 01:45:38,637
It’s very surprising that this Swiss bank
business

189
01:45:38,838 --> 01:45:45,372
has been attracting My attention
all the time.

190
01:45:45,993 --> 01:45:52,333
I don’t know much, how they can digest
everything so well.

191
01:45:55,069 --> 01:46:02,120
In these modern times, when people are
talking of democracy,

192
01:46:02,321 --> 01:46:05,751
talking of very big ideal things and
all that,

193
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:15,339
at the same time how can such a illegal
system exist openly?

194
01:46:16,319 --> 01:46:20,659
And for that I have a plan.

195
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:27,662
As Arneau has said I have to expose, I have
a plan to do something about it.

196
01:46:27,863 --> 01:46:33,812
As far as the materialism is concerned,
it’s working out.

197
01:46:34,013 --> 01:46:40,819
All these countries who were supposed to
be very advanced, developed are suffering;

198
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:45,776
first from recession – and a terrible
recession.

199
01:46:45,977 --> 01:46:49,776
That recession is going to give them
a lesson

200
01:46:49,999 --> 01:46:58,165
about overproduction of nonsensical goods.

201
01:46:58,452 --> 01:47:06,262
Materialism comes because people have
gone mad with their greed.

202
01:47:06,904 --> 01:47:15,801
I was searching a house in England – went
round to see houses, and I was surprised

203
01:47:16,002 --> 01:47:21,393
that all kinds of plastic things and mixed
things and all that,

204
01:47:21,594 --> 01:47:25,537
were piled up in mountains in every house,
mountains!

205
01:47:25,738 --> 01:47:33,692
And you pass through a door you will find
two legs of a pant falling on you.

206
01:47:33,893 --> 01:47:37,507
But not only in England, same in Paris:

207
01:47:37,708 --> 01:47:42,719
I’ve seen people accumulating so much
of nonsense

208
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:47,296
that they don’t know where to put it and
what to do.

209
01:47:47,979 --> 01:47:52,125
This madness is on and on and on.

210
01:47:52,326 --> 01:47:58,806
Now, I have found out a solution for Sahaja
Yogis, what they should do.

211
01:47:59,007 --> 01:48:03,662
They should try to encourage handicrafts.

212
01:48:04,525 --> 01:48:09,200
Every country I went to, I bought
handicrafts,

213
01:48:09,401 --> 01:48:17,223
whether it was Czechoslovakia or England
or anywhere.

214
01:48:17,424 --> 01:48:23,796
I cannot understand – how can you go
and buy this rubbish of plastic,

215
01:48:23,997 --> 01:48:26,497
of these useless things?

216
01:48:26,673 --> 01:48:30,099
And these handicrafts, when I bought,
I was surprised –

217
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:37,364
I must tell you about Czechoslovakia that
there were small, small, very small shops

218
01:48:37,565 --> 01:48:41,774
and they all came, one by one, “Mother,
buy something from us also,

219
01:48:41,974 --> 01:48:46,915
Mother buy something from us”. You know,
I was surprised, such beautiful things.

220
01:48:47,116 --> 01:48:54,583
They said, “We cannot sell them.” But all
nonsensical things people are buying.

221
01:48:54,784 --> 01:48:57,392
So for Sahaja Yogis, they must take a vow

222
01:48:57,593 --> 01:49:01,309
that “we’ll only take things which are
handmade”.

223
01:49:01,510 --> 01:49:09,483
You need not have many things, you can
have few, but something handmade.

224
01:49:09,684 --> 01:49:16,071
Now, supposing you get a dress, there
should be some handmade embroidery

225
01:49:16,272 --> 01:49:22,484
or something put it on that, so some labor
is put in into that.

226
01:49:24,559 --> 01:49:33,050
It is very difficult to see how people
go in for things

227
01:49:33,229 --> 01:49:41,192
which are very cheap and extremely
troublesome.

228
01:49:41,393 --> 01:49:44,633
I must tell you one thing, I can’t wear
nylon,

229
01:49:44,834 --> 01:49:48,954
I can’t wear anything artificial, really,
I can’t.

230
01:49:49,155 --> 01:49:54,468
For a while, if I even wear socks also,
My whole body starts paining.

231
01:49:54,669 --> 01:49:57,405
So, it is against you.

232
01:49:57,606 --> 01:50:06,780
Handmade things are few, I agree, but use
as far as possible handmade things.

233
01:50:06,981 --> 01:50:12,574
From the Mother Earth they make very nice,
say, terracotta.

234
01:50:12,775 --> 01:50:16,435
So, I’m a socialist by temperament,
I think.

235
01:50:16,636 --> 01:50:27,172
So, I felt a great urge that I should
really export nothing but terracotta.

236
01:50:27,689 --> 01:50:31,467
And terracotta is such a beautiful thing.

237
01:50:31,668 --> 01:50:36,408
It’s so soothing, it’s so good – it smells
so well.

238
01:50:36,609 --> 01:50:40,759
But people think, “No, we should buy
something that is made

239
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:48,812
from America in some machinery thing.”
They go on buying like that.

240
01:50:50,006 --> 01:50:55,643
In America also I was surprised that
beautiful things are selling

241
01:50:55,844 --> 01:51:00,554
in shops which they call them as outlets,
very good,

242
01:51:00,832 --> 01:51:10,300
mostly of silk, or of cotton, and leather –
pure leather.

243
01:51:10,501 --> 01:51:13,972
But people will go to big, big markets
and buy all nonsense

244
01:51:14,173 --> 01:51:19,335
at a very high price and not from there –
means they have no wisdom.

245
01:51:19,514 --> 01:51:25,338
And this is what happens, that the wisdom,
if it is lacking in your sense,

246
01:51:25,538 --> 01:51:31,134
then this wisdom corrodes the society.

247
01:51:31,335 --> 01:51:36,467
Because wisdom itself shows

248
01:51:36,668 --> 01:51:42,732
how dangerous it is to go on buying all
these nonsensical things.

249
01:51:43,297 --> 01:51:48,266
Also now you are seeing that people
are taking now more

250
01:51:48,467 --> 01:51:52,443
to Ayurveda and to homeopathy.

251
01:51:52,644 --> 01:51:58,557
They don’t want to use these horrible
medicines produced by your great country.

252
01:51:58,758 --> 01:52:07,791
You know what they do, Swiss? They send
very big offers

253
01:52:07,992 --> 01:52:11,842
to doctors from India to come to work
for them.

254
01:52:12,043 --> 01:52:16,607
And supposing they have produced one “A”
sample as you’ve shown,

255
01:52:16,808 --> 01:52:20,748
then the same one they change a little bit
(and) say “It’s better”.

256
01:52:20,949 --> 01:52:26,537
And you know these medicines, most of them
are very dangerous and troublesome.

257
01:52:26,738 --> 01:52:30,761
By mistake, My family gave Me these
antibiotics.

258
01:52:30,962 --> 01:52:36,712
Since then My legs are very weak and
troublesome – I’ve improved, no doubt.

259
01:52:36,913 --> 01:52:40,542
So, you see, why we are now taking
to this -

260
01:52:40,743 --> 01:52:46,130
because pollution is there another thing,
which is created by this machinery.

261
01:52:46,331 --> 01:52:51,028
Gandhiji was saying: “There is no need
to use so much machinery.”

262
01:52:51,229 --> 01:52:57,329
Now, motor cars – we can walk, we can
use trains,

263
01:52:57,530 --> 01:53:03,617
but people want to go anywhere by motor
car, even if it is about, say,

264
01:53:03,818 --> 01:53:09,354
ten meters, they don’t want to walk.
That’s how our health has gone down.

265
01:53:09,555 --> 01:53:15,313
I must tell you when I was studying in the
school, My school was about five miles.

266
01:53:15,477 --> 01:53:23,058
And we had a car, and we had also horses,
and what we call is a buggy in our house.

267
01:53:23,259 --> 01:53:28,492
But it was compulsory for us to walk
five miles in the morning.

268
01:53:28,693 --> 01:53:31,278
Evening time the car used to come,

269
01:53:31,479 --> 01:53:37,863
but morning time we all had to walk
five miles to go to our school.

270
01:53:38,064 --> 01:53:43,921
And in between there was a small, little
mountain which we had to climb.

271
01:53:44,122 --> 01:53:51,214
That is how we learnt about nature. If you
don’t walk, from the car what do you know?

272
01:53:51,415 --> 01:53:55,445
At the most you can see some lamppost.

273
01:53:55,646 --> 01:54:01,427
What do you see from the car? Nothing,
you cannot see the nature.

274
01:54:01,627 --> 01:54:08,491
And this walking system is very much out
of date now for people. People don’t walk.

275
01:54:09,506 --> 01:54:16,311
I’m not saying that today we are very
changed, and we are very advanced people.

276
01:54:16,494 --> 01:54:21,573
In a way we have gone down because
we cannot walk.

277
01:54:21,774 --> 01:54:25,843
God has given these legs to walk, but
we cannot walk.

278
01:54:26,044 --> 01:54:32,356
We avoid walking. Now, because of that
so many cars.

279
01:54:33,250 --> 01:54:38,894
I know that in some families they have
five cars because 5 family members.

280
01:54:39,095 --> 01:54:43,561
Especially in Spain, I was surprised,
so many cars, so many cars

281
01:54:43,762 --> 01:54:48,563
and every car has only one person in it
sitting.

282
01:54:49,408 --> 01:54:54,041
Now, problem has started with the pollution
and all these things,

283
01:54:54,242 --> 01:55:00,688
because we have lost the habits
of depending upon ourselves.

284
01:55:01,429 --> 01:55:09,989
Now see what has happened in, say,

285
01:55:10,190 --> 01:55:16,486
this Kuala Lumpur and all these places
suffering from what you call, the smoke.

286
01:55:16,696 --> 01:55:21,478
Now I have not done it, if you think that
way. And they are praying to Allah,

287
01:55:21,679 --> 01:55:24,732
“Give us water”. Why should God give
them water

288
01:55:24,933 --> 01:55:29,790
when they are doing all kinds of
nonsensical things?

289
01:55:30,512 --> 01:55:35,273
Now, there is smoke going on, why? Because
they have cut the trees.

290
01:55:35,474 --> 01:55:43,748
So, why do they want to cut the trees?
Because they want to make money, that’s all.

291
01:55:43,949 --> 01:55:49,753
Their wood is coming to India, because in
India also they have cut the trees.

292
01:55:49,954 --> 01:55:54,159
If you go on like this – mad, you will have
pollution, means what?

293
01:55:54,360 --> 01:56:00,030
Is that, destructive forces will act
and stop it.

294
01:56:01,827 --> 01:56:05,799
For that you don’t have to pray to
the Goddess, it will work out.

295
01:56:05,976 --> 01:56:08,711
And it’s all working out everywhere.

296
01:56:08,912 --> 01:56:14,220
So, whatever you have to have, try to have
something which is handmade.

297
01:56:14,421 --> 01:56:21,488
Even your clothes - need not be many,
try to have it which are handmade -

298
01:56:22,921 --> 01:56:26,230
is one of the things Sahaja Yogis can do.

299
01:56:26,431 --> 01:56:32,119
There need not be to send money to this
Swiss Bank also.

300
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:34,871
This Swiss Bank will be very badly exposed
now,

301
01:56:35,048 --> 01:56:38,826
I’m angry with them for one more thing,
that they had promised that they’ll give

302
01:56:39,027 --> 01:56:43,553
the money to the Jews and now they are
going like this, they don’t want to give.

303
01:56:43,754 --> 01:56:48,454
When they will die are they going
to take it with them?

304
01:56:51,802 --> 01:56:56,667
All these sins will be punished and that is
why I’m very happy

305
01:56:56,868 --> 01:56:59,718
this he has brought in, because I’ve been
talking about it –

306
01:56:59,919 --> 01:57:05,733
even in that conference I went to in China,
I talked openly about this Swiss Bank.

307
01:57:05,934 --> 01:57:12,342
I have talked to many magistrates and
to many, what you call them,

308
01:57:12,543 --> 01:57:17,062
the head of the law ministry and all that,
and I’ve told them,

309
01:57:17,263 --> 01:57:24,122
“Why not we have a conference and say
that this banking is nonsense”.

310
01:57:24,323 --> 01:57:34,445
Now, all types of bad people are taking
advantage of this system

311
01:57:34,646 --> 01:57:40,157
and are trying to make money, look very
nice or so, I don’t know.

312
01:57:40,358 --> 01:57:42,704
So many have lost their money there,

313
01:57:42,881 --> 01:57:45,436
I don’t know what was the need to put
all this money there.

314
01:57:45,637 --> 01:57:49,857
That when they die, their children do not
get anything.

315
01:57:50,058 --> 01:57:58,902
But the problem is this greed, is some sort
of a inner defect in a human being.

316
01:57:59,799 --> 01:58:10,811
He becomes greedy, greedy because he has
deviated from dharma.

317
01:58:12,571 --> 01:58:18,239
He thinks he can get pleasure out
of things, he cannot.

318
01:58:18,580 --> 01:58:23,862
And he goes on accumulating and buying
and this and that.

319
01:58:24,063 --> 01:58:31,125
I would say your Mother also does that.
I buy, but I buy things which are handmade.

320
01:58:31,331 --> 01:58:37,345
So that tomorrow, if I have to give it
presents, or if I have to sell off things,

321
01:58:37,546 --> 01:58:42,631
even the ornaments you have given Me,
I didn’t know what to do, I’m selling them.

322
01:58:42,832 --> 01:58:52,217
What will I do with the ornaments – I have
to buy so many ashrams, this, that.

323
01:58:52,418 --> 01:58:55,368
My family ornaments also I’m selling,

324
01:58:55,569 --> 01:58:59,962
because I spent money on My family things
also.

325
01:59:00,163 --> 01:59:07,174
Just think of it, what is all this for,
what pleasure does it give us?

326
01:59:07,357 --> 01:59:11,259
I can understand, if you want to give
somebody a present,

327
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:18,093
or somebody you want to give some
happiness, joy – you should do it,

328
01:59:18,294 --> 01:59:25,412
but just for yourself go on, go on, how
much can you digest it? You cannot.

329
01:59:25,613 --> 01:59:29,240
Joy is much more in giving to others.

330
01:59:29,441 --> 01:59:37,729
It’s not, it’s not a thing that gives you
any understanding of the fundamentals,

331
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:43,645
and the fundamentals is that you are
dharma.

332
01:59:43,846 --> 01:59:51,613
Within you is that, that is your valency,
and this materialism absolutely against it,

333
01:59:51,814 --> 02:00:04,261
because it creates all kinds of people:
mafias, this Swiss bank, cheats -

334
02:00:04,462 --> 02:00:09,284
we have communities after communities
who are known to be cheats,

335
02:00:09,485 --> 02:00:13,693
who are very materialistic, they have
no spiritual sense.

336
02:00:13,894 --> 02:00:18,477
So for Sahaja Yogis, I would say -
of course you have said all the mantras

337
02:00:18,678 --> 02:00:22,583
so I’m supposed to do all that.
But what you have to do

338
02:00:22,784 --> 02:00:28,139
is not to buy any more anything which is
not handmade. Try it.

339
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:30,740
At least, there should be some embroidery,

340
02:00:30,941 --> 02:00:35,345
at least, there should be some work
done on it.

341
02:00:35,551 --> 02:00:39,943
I’m surprised that these things are
not very good for us,

342
02:00:40,144 --> 02:00:42,904
they are injurious to our health.

343
02:00:43,105 --> 02:00:48,244
So Sahaja Yogis must learn that they
have to walk.

344
02:00:48,445 --> 02:00:53,252
They must walk and they must see
the nature, what is in the nature.

345
02:00:53,453 --> 02:00:58,998
Many of you don’t know what - say, I ask
the name of this flower,

346
02:00:59,199 --> 02:01:02,382
how many of you know?

347
02:01:06,970 --> 02:01:15,285
It’s a very sweet name, “Kiss Me Quick”,
apart from its botanical name.

348
02:01:15,486 --> 02:01:19,575
But it is, you see, what I’m saying,
everything you should know -

349
02:01:19,776 --> 02:01:26,655
you should know about small, small things,
from where do this embroidery comes?

350
02:01:26,856 --> 02:01:29,939
From where does this sari comes?

351
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:35,921
Our Indian men are the worst, I would say,
they don’t know anything whatsoever.

352
02:01:36,122 --> 02:01:40,188
But even western men also have the same
problem.

353
02:01:40,389 --> 02:01:44,447
You must take interest in things in which
you have not taken interest.

354
02:01:44,643 --> 02:01:48,924
For example, Indians don’t know how
to cook, they don’t know!

355
02:01:49,125 --> 02:01:52,371
Once My husband told Me that he knows
how to cook.

356
02:01:52,572 --> 02:01:56,746
I said, “What? He said, “I’ll make
chapatis, rotis.”

357
02:01:56,947 --> 02:02:03,142
And what he made was nothing –
Australia, America, this, that.

358
02:02:04,806 --> 02:02:10,891
But he said, “I give up because I was doing
shipping, but shipping means shipping.”

359
02:02:12,784 --> 02:02:20,078
But minute things you can see, what we
call is a subtle vision, subtle eyesight.

360
02:02:20,279 --> 02:02:26,201
If you walk, look at the nature, love
the trees, love the animals.

361
02:02:26,402 --> 02:02:30,127
You’ll be amazed, there are so many
things to be known

362
02:02:30,328 --> 02:02:34,058
than reading newspaper, what is there
to read in the newspaper?

363
02:02:34,259 --> 02:02:39,514
For hours together you go on reading
newspaper, next day you forget it.

364
02:02:39,715 --> 02:02:46,982
You’ll be amazed that they say that
for Goddess it is said that

365
02:02:47,183 --> 02:02:53,893
“Kataksha Kataksha Nirikshana” – every
glance, She knows everything.

366
02:02:54,094 --> 02:03:00,961
Any glance She puts on any man, woman
or anything, She knows where it is.

367
02:03:01,162 --> 02:03:04,233
And if you are My children you should
also try that,

368
02:03:04,394 --> 02:03:08,245
because I always used to run out
into jungles, in the forest,

369
02:03:08,446 --> 02:03:14,963
I used to go to all such places and really
enjoy the beautiful Mother,

370
02:03:15,164 --> 02:03:20,191
this Mother Earth who has created such
a beautiful thing.

371
02:03:20,392 --> 02:03:25,535
Have you noticed just now that the colors
of the background

372
02:03:25,736 --> 02:03:32,569
which were made by the Russians and
the colors of this facing thing

373
02:03:32,770 --> 02:03:39,051
are just the same, they have used the same
colors. It’s true collectivity.

374
02:03:39,252 --> 02:03:44,559
Now, you notice in the nature it’s so
matching, you know.

375
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:47,438
Nothing gross, nothing loud – it’s
so beautiful,

376
02:03:47,639 --> 02:03:51,701
this is red but it has green to match it.

377
02:03:51,902 --> 02:03:55,400
This Mother Earth knows everything,
She understands everything,

378
02:03:55,601 --> 02:04:00,631
She does everything, but what do we do
for Mother Earth? –

379
02:04:00,832 --> 02:04:05,219
Is to run after artificial things,
machinery, this thing –

380
02:04:05,420 --> 02:04:09,206
and now a new thing has come, is computer.

381
02:04:10,650 --> 02:04:12,917
It’s all right if you want to write letters
to someone,

382
02:04:13,118 --> 02:04:16,131
but otherwise it’s quite maddening,
you know.

383
02:04:16,332 --> 02:04:20,250
And this computer will make our brain
absolutely zero.

384
02:04:20,451 --> 02:04:24,561
We’ll be paralyzed, we won’t be able
to think 2 + 2.

385
02:04:24,762 --> 02:04:29,922
So, anything that you want to use also,
should have its maryadas,

386
02:04:30,123 --> 02:04:33,741
don’t go beyond it. If you take
to swimming,

387
02:04:33,942 --> 02:04:37,218
you’ll go on swimming till you get sick.

388
02:04:37,432 --> 02:04:42,782
If you are horse-riding, you’ll go on
horse-riding till you fall down.

389
02:04:42,983 --> 02:04:49,645
You see, this is also a kind of a life
which has no maryadas –

390
02:04:49,846 --> 02:04:56,779
like greed has no maryadas, that’s how
also this kind of nonsense,

391
02:04:56,980 --> 02:05:00,383
“I am only fond of this, I am only
fond of this.”

392
02:05:00,584 --> 02:05:04,000
You are a human being, you should never
say like that.

393
02:05:04,201 --> 02:05:08,269
On the contrary you should say, “I must
learn this, I must know this,

394
02:05:08,470 --> 02:05:12,651
what is this all about?”. It is very
important,

395
02:05:12,852 --> 02:05:17,970
otherwise your personality will be a dwarf
personality –

396
02:05:18,171 --> 02:05:23,394
and ultimately people end up in money.
I don’t understand.

397
02:05:23,595 --> 02:05:27,640
I can’t even count 200 notes, can’t even.

398
02:05:27,841 --> 02:05:31,599
I don’t know about money, I should say.
But I’m good at mathematics -

399
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:35,613
but I don’t know, whatever money you are
giving goes direct to them

400
02:05:35,814 --> 02:05:38,592
and they do it what they like. Now,
if somebody says,

401
02:05:38,793 --> 02:05:41,668
“How much You got for this?”
“I don’t know”.

402
02:05:41,869 --> 02:05:48,013
“How much for royalties?” “I don’t know”,
because I’m not interested.

403
02:05:48,214 --> 02:05:52,694
I’m not interested. What is there to be
so much interested in money?

404
02:05:52,895 --> 02:05:58,812
But I get money, all right, no problem,
never a problem.

405
02:05:59,013 --> 02:06:01,830
I sold one of My ornaments

406
02:06:02,031 --> 02:06:06,726
and I got at least 100 times more
than what I have spent.

407
02:06:06,926 --> 02:06:11,235
Maybe you might say it’s vibrations,
whatever you may say.

408
02:06:11,436 --> 02:06:22,180
So to get after money means you get
very much in the clutches of money.

409
02:06:22,807 --> 02:06:28,290
So what is the solution, to get rid
of this greed?

410
02:06:28,504 --> 02:06:33,946
Is to try and give it to others and see
the joy.

411
02:06:35,234 --> 02:06:43,369
Give something to others, share and see
the joy you feel by giving something.

412
02:06:45,676 --> 02:06:48,890
I must tell you, Gregoire is not her
 but I am missing him

413
02:06:49,091 --> 02:06:54,395
because once I went to a sari shop
and wanted to buy one sari

414
02:06:54,596 --> 02:06:57,075
but I thought “It’s rather expensive,

415
02:06:57,276 --> 02:07:02,899
why should I buy such an expensive sari”,
came away.

416
02:07:03,100 --> 02:07:09,077
And you’ll be amazed, he gave Me the same
sari on My birthday

417
02:07:09,278 --> 02:07:13,789
and I was so filled with joy, because
he bought it next day,

418
02:07:13,990 --> 02:07:20,241
went and bought it from that shop, kept it
with him and on My birthday he gave Me.

419
02:07:22,642 --> 02:07:26,314
These small, small things can give you
great joy

420
02:07:26,515 --> 02:07:32,395
in giving people, other people,
not yourself.

421
02:07:32,596 --> 02:07:37,178
I don’t know if I have bought anything
much for Myself in My lifetime, never.

422
02:07:37,379 --> 02:07:39,660
Even if I go out shopping, even if
I am thirsty,

423
02:07:39,861 --> 02:07:43,978
I won’t even buy one Coca-Cola for Myself.

424
02:07:44,179 --> 02:07:48,321
People know that I don’t buy anything
for Myself,

425
02:07:48,522 --> 02:07:51,796
practically nothing, but you all give Me
so much, what to do.

426
02:07:51,997 --> 02:07:59,180
Now, I have decided that after these
75 years of age,

427
02:07:59,381 --> 02:08:03,110
I shouldn’t take anything from you
whatsoever.

428
02:08:03,311 --> 02:08:06,014
But to please you maybe, they are asking
that,

429
02:08:06,215 --> 02:08:10,886
“Only take a national, international”,
all right. But no more,

430
02:08:11,087 --> 02:08:15,816
every country shouldn’t bring. What
after all this national, international –

431
02:08:16,017 --> 02:08:21,369
you are all international people, what is
the need to bring any present for Me?

432
02:08:21,570 --> 02:08:25,731
I don’t even have time to see them.

433
02:08:26,638 --> 02:08:33,287
I’m so very busy with other things, because
there are so many problems in this world.

434
02:08:33,509 --> 02:08:37,214
So, I would suggest that, to get over
all these things

435
02:08:37,415 --> 02:08:41,396
we should see ourselves, what we are
doing about it.

436
02:08:41,605 --> 02:08:45,982
I’m sure none of you have money
in the Swiss Bank, thank God.

437
02:08:46,183 --> 02:08:52,284
But never earn more than what you can –
you have, there’s no need.

438
02:08:52,485 --> 02:08:57,158
Whatever comes your way is all right.
Of course if you are doing some work

439
02:08:57,359 --> 02:09:04,557
of creativity, of creating some designs,
creating something is all right.

440
02:09:05,448 --> 02:09:09,205
But don’t buy things, go on buying things
for yourself

441
02:09:09,406 --> 02:09:17,349
or putting then money here, hiding, hiding
there, there’s no need.

442
02:09:17,739 --> 02:09:23,252
You see, you’ll feel so satisfied and
so happy being honest,

443
02:09:23,453 --> 02:09:31,117
being absolutely beyond any problem.

444
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:37,003
Now this mafia business is there, I agree
with you. Now this mafia can be controlled

445
02:09:37,204 --> 02:09:43,010
only by the government because they give
such a big tax.

446
02:09:43,211 --> 02:09:46,918
Now I mean, for example, an artisan
in this poor country -

447
02:09:47,119 --> 02:09:51,840
I will say poor because most of the people
are suffering from tax –

448
02:09:52,041 --> 02:09:58,296
you see, he has to pay 265 types of taxes.

449
02:09:59,414 --> 02:10:04,241
Italians are known for their art, they make
beautiful things,

450
02:10:04,442 --> 02:10:08,644
but they cannot because they have to pay
so much taxation.

451
02:10:08,845 --> 02:10:11,983
Only the designers they make the money.

452
02:10:12,183 --> 02:10:17,047
Designers make the money befooling
everybody.

453
02:10:18,598 --> 02:10:26,470
They befool people so much. Once My husband
went to Cairo and bought one scarf for Me.

454
02:10:27,718 --> 02:10:30,324
So, he said, “This is designer’s.”

455
02:10:30,525 --> 02:10:35,618
I said, “This looks Indian to me, this is
an Indian thing.”

456
02:10:35,819 --> 02:10:41,049
And surprisingly in the corner it was
written “Made in India”.

457
02:10:42,129 --> 02:10:49,145
He paid £25 for that, in India you can
get it for £2.

458
02:10:50,592 --> 02:10:54,603
So, this is another thing is to run a race
of eliteness.

459
02:10:54,804 --> 02:10:58,795
You see this one was bought by
My son-in-law.

460
02:10:58,996 --> 02:11:03,986
I said: “What is so special?”
He said, “It’s very great, you know.”

461
02:11:04,194 --> 02:11:07,956
I didn’t know what was so special about
those spectacles.

462
02:11:08,157 --> 02:11:14,381
So, I went to one shop in America

463
02:11:14,582 --> 02:11:17,566
and they all started saying, “Madam,
Madam, Madam …”.

464
02:11:17,767 --> 02:11:22,344
I said, “What is so Madam about Me?.
Why are they calling Me ‘Madam’?”

465
02:11:22,545 --> 02:11:29,081
“Oh, You don’t know?” - they said - “This
is Cartier.” I said, “Who is this Cartier?”

466
02:11:29,282 --> 02:11:33,795
So I’m going to put Kartikeya against him!

467
02:11:35,957 --> 02:11:43,952
All such stupid ideas, you see, and then
they bought Me a…

468
02:11:44,153 --> 02:11:52,661
[Aside: “What you call that? The watch was…
what was that watch? Ah, Patek Philippe!] -

469
02:11:52,862 --> 02:11:57,519
Patek Philippe, that watch they brought
for Me

470
02:11:57,720 --> 02:12:02,349
and it would not run in time. I said,
“What is this?

471
02:12:02,984 --> 02:12:07,404
Never keeps the time, it’s always
out of time.

472
02:12:07,990 --> 02:12:11,136
My vibrations must be trying some tricks”.

473
02:12:11,337 --> 02:12:15,102
So I gave it to one of them, I said, “Baba,
show this to the Patek Phillips.”

474
02:12:15,388 --> 02:12:19,383
Ah, that day Mathias was here. “This
will hit their ego, Mother, very much”.

475
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:23,529
I said, “Why?” “Because they think
they are the best.”

476
02:12:24,196 --> 02:12:28,358
I said, “Whatever it is, tell them you
change it, it doesn’t keep to time.”

477
02:12:28,559 --> 02:12:32,079
Then I asked My daughter to have it,
I said, “Baba, I can’t make …

478
02:12:32,280 --> 02:12:36,645
I don’t know why, maybe I will have
something simple, it’s better.”

479
02:12:36,846 --> 02:12:43,009
That too again turned out to be a,
what you call? ‘Designers’.

480
02:12:43,210 --> 02:12:47,880
They are now all - most of these designers
are in jail.

481
02:12:48,081 --> 02:12:53,153
And some of them met Me when I was
coming from Russia.

482
02:12:53,354 --> 02:12:57,841
They are absolutely useless people,
you know.

483
02:12:58,042 --> 02:13:00,762
They take out some idea and sell it
for a high price

484
02:13:00,971 --> 02:13:09,625
and if you are a fool you go and buy that.
Did you notice that this is Cartier?

485
02:13:12,058 --> 02:13:17,856
For Sahaja Yogis are simple people. Now
this is the thing is that there are,

486
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:21,314
these are also mafias, I tell you, these
are also mafias.

487
02:13:21,515 --> 02:13:25,460
And these mafias are exploiting you,
I’ve written it in My book also,

488
02:13:25,661 --> 02:13:30,074
if you read it, how these entrepreneurs
are trying to befool you.

489
02:13:30,275 --> 02:13:37,113
You wear simple dress, simple from
handmade – will be much better

490
02:13:37,314 --> 02:13:43,543
than to wear something that makes you
look like something out of the blue.

491
02:13:44,309 --> 02:13:49,714
And there is no need because it is just
satisfying your ego.

492
02:13:49,915 --> 02:13:59,469
Some people have a habit – as soon as –
say, I have, supposing some dinner set,

493
02:13:59,670 --> 02:14:04,235
may not be good or… - they’ll come and see
the back of the dinner plate.

494
02:14:04,436 --> 02:14:09,149
“Ah, from where did You get it?” –
“I don’t know.” “You don’t know?”

495
02:14:09,350 --> 02:14:13,321
“No, no, this was, I think, I think somebody
gave Me, I don’t know, I don’t know.”

496
02:14:13,535 --> 02:14:16,278
“No, no, You better find out, because
very nice.”

497
02:14:16,446 --> 02:14:19,567
Next day they’ll go round the whole place
to find out

498
02:14:19,768 --> 02:14:23,548
if they can get the same dinner set.

499
02:14:23,749 --> 02:14:28,171
And Sahaja Yoga is just the opposite.
I tell you, you depend on Sahaja Yoga.

500
02:14:28,372 --> 02:14:37,933
Once My husband liked one tea set. So
you know London has huge, big stores.

501
02:14:38,134 --> 02:14:41,985
Some of them are really horrid.
I went there –

502
02:14:42,186 --> 02:14:46,221
baarpre baap - we walked and walked
and walked through so many.

503
02:14:46,422 --> 02:14:50,207
They said, “All right, we promise after
6 months.” Another said, “7 months”,

504
02:14:50,408 --> 02:14:57,803
another said, “8 months, you give us
the order.” So I gave up the idea.

505
02:14:58,091 --> 02:15:00,792
Then C.P. said, “What has happened
to their factories?”

506
02:15:01,022 --> 02:15:03,825
I said, “They don’t have anything, they
are exporting.”

507
02:15:04,026 --> 02:15:10,989
Then I went to Australia, you’ll be amazed
- and there for a special price,

508
02:15:11,190 --> 02:15:17,111
just for propagating, they had put
these tea sets there.

509
02:15:17,833 --> 02:15:23,379
Imagine, in Australia, and I got it
for the half price.

510
02:15:23,996 --> 02:15:30,100
So, if you don’t have greed you get
what you want just there.

511
02:15:32,427 --> 02:15:35,788
Just there you get it.

512
02:15:36,742 --> 02:15:42,222
But if you have greed, then God makes
you dance. All right?

513
02:15:42,432 --> 02:15:46,904
That is what is so simple as that -
whatever you want you can get it,

514
02:15:47,105 --> 02:15:50,621
if you don’t have greed about it.

515
02:15:50,828 --> 02:15:56,610
That’s such an enslaving thing within us,
that we have greed.

516
02:15:56,811 --> 02:16:03,316
I mean I can give you 1,001 examples
of that, 1,001.

517
02:16:03,517 --> 02:16:09,474
That if you don’t ask for anything, if you
don’t desire for anything,

518
02:16:09,675 --> 02:16:15,768
you get what you need, whatever you need
you get.

519
02:16:16,427 --> 02:16:23,682
But if you go on desiring, then go mad
after it. Go there, get this and get lost.

520
02:16:24,054 --> 02:16:27,523
And then the thing also gets lost.

521
02:16:27,724 --> 02:16:34,971
That’s why it is said, better try
to develop a detachment.

522
02:16:35,309 --> 02:16:40,334
It’s all right, if it is there well and
good, if it is not there, doesn’t matter.

523
02:16:41,587 --> 02:16:45,298
Then you’ll be surprised your attention
will be so subtle.

524
02:16:45,499 --> 02:16:51,471
Now none of you I think have seen these
beautiful flowers, what are there.

525
02:16:51,672 --> 02:16:57,271
The beautiful embroidery that is there.
The way they have done this.

526
02:16:57,472 --> 02:17:02,571
Now can you tell Me how many there are,
hands in this work –

527
02:17:05,052 --> 02:17:14,418
14, 28. This side 14, this side 14.

528
02:17:20,480 --> 02:17:26,143
I mean, inclusive of all these other
things.

529
02:17:27,608 --> 02:17:33,460
So you don’t notice anything and your
attention becomes…

530
02:17:33,661 --> 02:17:38,281
“Mahamaya” - they say has been - “it has
been the Mahamaya”. This is no explanation.

531
02:17:38,482 --> 02:17:45,284
Your attention if it is clear, is simple,
you can see the thing clearly.

532
02:17:46,926 --> 02:17:52,251
And with that attention only, that
attention yourself

533
02:17:53,135 --> 02:17:55,724
takes you to the right place where you
have to go,

534
02:17:55,925 --> 02:17:59,823
you get the right thing what you want
to buy.

535
02:18:03,129 --> 02:18:07,624
Can you tell Me you see these carpets
are from where?

536
02:18:13,804 --> 02:18:17,150
They are mostly from Russia.

537
02:18:18,862 --> 02:18:27,603
I went to Russia and I saw this carpet
factory. They have no sense of export also.

538
02:18:27,804 --> 02:18:32,848
So I told them that, “How much will
a carpet cost?” - Doctor knows -

539
02:18:33,049 --> 02:18:38,472
They said, “Only $20.” I said, “Baba,
$20 for a carpet?”

540
02:18:38,673 --> 02:18:42,556
So, I told Doctor, “Now what to do,
we have to buy many”.

541
02:18:42,757 --> 02:18:47,905
I said, “How much for export?” “$200.”

542
02:18:48,483 --> 02:18:52,611
I said, “In India the other way round.
If you have to export something,

543
02:18:52,812 --> 02:18:58,127
then the price is less.” I said,
“All right,

544
02:18:58,328 --> 02:19:02,262
so I guess we must think of the solution
because I need it.”

545
02:19:02,463 --> 02:19:06,700
So I asked about 20 Sahaja Yogis to go
and buy each one.

546
02:19:06,908 --> 02:19:12,143
To Russians they give for $20.
I said, “All right, you bring these.”

547
02:19:13,319 --> 02:19:19,471
So, you should go in for solutions and not
for problems.

548
02:19:19,672 --> 02:19:24,705
Greed is a problem, greed is a problem.

549
02:19:24,906 --> 02:19:27,802
How to get rid of the greed is the point.

550
02:19:28,003 --> 02:19:31,652
And to get rid of the greed is that
if I buy something –

551
02:19:31,853 --> 02:19:37,162
for whom should I buy this one, for whom
should I buy?

552
02:19:37,363 --> 02:19:42,973
Ah, this will be all right for another
friend of mine, like that.

553
02:19:43,174 --> 02:19:49,979
If you train your mind on these lines,
not for yourself, but for others,

554
02:19:50,180 --> 02:19:56,184
then you’ll be amazed this greed will run
away and you’ll have joy.

555
02:19:56,978 --> 02:20:01,571
As you want to give Me things, I understand
that, I also want to give you.

556
02:20:01,772 --> 02:20:07,585
In the same way, think of all others,
they are all brothers and sisters.

557
02:20:08,477 --> 02:20:12,837
From other countries, make friends
with other countries.

558
02:20:13,038 --> 02:20:17,008
If giving is there, then this greed goes
away (indistinct)

559
02:20:17,209 --> 02:20:22,862
and you get what you want. It’s a very
simple mantra.

560
02:20:24,599 --> 02:20:34,438
It’s surprising, so far, with all
the miracles,

561
02:20:34,639 --> 02:20:39,524
we don’t understand that whatever
we need also be provided for.

562
02:20:39,725 --> 02:20:46,823
But you must need it, not for stupid
collection of things.

563
02:20:48,154 --> 02:20:53,481
This was a very, very good thing, acted
very well, I enjoyed it thoroughly,

564
02:20:53,682 --> 02:20:59,712
this Swiss Bank laundering. I know
My country suffers from it.

565
02:21:00,354 --> 02:21:05,404
Now, the another drama, which was done
by the English,

566
02:21:05,605 --> 02:21:11,610
shows – it’s a – “Pilgrim’s Progress” is
an old, quite an old drama,

567
02:21:11,811 --> 02:21:16,947
which I have read long time back. But this
is the real pilgrims they have shown,

568
02:21:17,148 --> 02:21:21,836
how a seeker goes into wrong ways, methods,

569
02:21:22,037 --> 02:21:26,474
and throughout they have very nicely
brought in how even a Sahaja Yogi,

570
02:21:26,675 --> 02:21:32,455
while rising, falls into different pits.
So it’s a very good thing for you to know

571
02:21:32,656 --> 02:21:38,069
that if you are Sahaja Yogis, you should be
very careful, and you should see that

572
02:21:38,270 --> 02:21:45,307
you don’t fall into these pits and
ultimately the ego and superego.

573
02:21:46,097 --> 02:21:53,798
In the west the problem is more of ego,
not of superego. And for ego,

574
02:21:58,616 --> 02:22:06,171
to accept that you have ego is the only
way; and then it will drop out.

575
02:22:06,372 --> 02:22:10,706
If you know there is ego, ego will
drop out.

576
02:22:11,651 --> 02:22:16,790
The simple thing is to know that you have
ego. Ego of something.

577
02:22:16,991 --> 02:22:20,239
People have ego of any nonsense, you know.

578
02:22:20,440 --> 02:22:23,619
There was one lady very proud
and egoistical.

579
02:22:23,820 --> 02:22:29,924
So I asked about her, “What is the matter
with her?”

580
02:22:30,125 --> 02:22:33,245
“Because she knows how to make dolls” –
Why?

581
02:22:33,446 --> 02:22:37,078
That should give you ego or what?
I didn’t understand that part.

582
02:22:37,279 --> 02:22:41,025
But this is what it is, even for small
things people have ego,

583
02:22:41,226 --> 02:22:49,274
and all this designing and all that
is based on your stupid ego

584
02:22:49,475 --> 02:22:53,882
which makes you buy all these things
to show off your ego.

585
02:22:54,083 --> 02:23:01,544
So try to be humble – humble and try
to understand

586
02:23:01,745 --> 02:23:06,701
that all these worldly things we are not
going to take them with us.

587
02:23:06,902 --> 02:23:09,588
They are going to lie down here. I am not
saying you renounce.

588
02:23:09,802 --> 02:23:13,734
I’m not saying you take sanyasa, but you
should know that

589
02:23:13,935 --> 02:23:17,742
the value of these things is nothing
compared to you.

590
02:23:17,943 --> 02:23:20,408
When ego comes, this idiocity comes in.

591
02:23:20,609 --> 02:23:27,093
You think by wearing something great
you are very much influencing others.

592
02:23:27,294 --> 02:23:34,427
You may, but those who are influenced
are another set of fools, I must say.

593
02:23:34,628 --> 02:23:41,630
Once I was wearing a ring and I went
to shopping in one of the places

594
02:23:41,831 --> 02:23:45,256
and they were so respectful to Me.
I said, “Suddenly the shopkeepers,

595
02:23:45,457 --> 02:23:50,247
they never respect Me because I’m
an Indian – what has happened?”

596
02:23:50,409 --> 02:23:54,497
So I had gone to a shop where the lady
was known to Me.

597
02:23:54,698 --> 02:24:00,526
She said, “May I ask You, is this real?”
I said, “What do you mean, real?”

598
02:24:00,727 --> 02:24:06,182
“Is it a real emerald?” “Yes, yes, very old
from My family.”

599
02:24:06,407 --> 02:24:10,111
“Ah, so Your family very rich?”

600
02:24:10,312 --> 02:24:16,446
“No, no, it was from My forefathers,
I’m just wearing that.”

601
02:24:16,647 --> 02:24:21,702
“Oh my God, if it is real, what will be
the price?” I said, “How will I know,

602
02:24:21,903 --> 02:24:26,192
it was bought long time back, I don’t know
the price.” “No, can you get me one?”

603
02:24:26,393 --> 02:24:30,637
I said, “Why do you want to have it,
you can have this one if you like.”

604
02:24:30,838 --> 02:24:38,296
Like that, you know, a small thing makes
them so…, that you are so great. It’s not.

605
02:24:38,497 --> 02:24:42,267
What is the greatest thing in us is
our Spirit,

606
02:24:42,468 --> 02:24:47,181
is the Spirit that we have and we should
know that we should be proud of it,

607
02:24:47,382 --> 02:24:50,125
that we have got the Spirit within us.

608
02:24:50,326 --> 02:24:55,856
And if you become proud, then you will not
do nonsensical things.

609
02:24:56,057 --> 02:24:59,547
You are people who are all realized souls.

610
02:24:59,748 --> 02:25:04,617
And already, you have crossed over this
pilgrims stage, you are much above that.

611
02:25:04,818 --> 02:25:09,189
Now the greatest thing is to know that
we are spiritual people

612
02:25:09,390 --> 02:25:17,006
and as spiritual people – you even
dominate Me, in a way.

613
02:25:17,207 --> 02:25:21,113
If you all desire for something, I can’t
get over it.

614
02:25:21,313 --> 02:25:28,304
I have to accept. I have to keep you
pleased.

615
02:25:28,505 --> 02:25:33,168
Many things I’m doing just because
you want it;

616
02:25:33,369 --> 02:25:38,452
doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter to Me
because nothing comes over My head.

617
02:25:38,653 --> 02:25:41,857
So it’s all right, whatever children want,
let them do.

618
02:25:42,058 --> 02:25:49,095
But the one point is this ego has to be
really under control.

619
02:25:50,101 --> 02:25:53,706
There’s one little more point I want
to tell you,

620
02:25:53,907 --> 02:25:55,947
because tomorrow I may not be able to say,

621
02:25:56,148 --> 02:26:00,638
in Navaratri, you see, I am bound by other
things, is this –

622
02:26:00,839 --> 02:26:06,986
I wanted to talk to people who are married
in Sahaja Yoga, especially to the ladies.

623
02:26:07,187 --> 02:26:14,196
I think some of them are extremely
dominating and stupid.

624
02:26:14,529 --> 02:26:20,708
What is marriage? Marriage is honeymoon
as they call it.

625
02:26:20,909 --> 02:26:25,904
Honey is the essence and moon is the peace.

626
02:26:26,105 --> 02:26:32,237
Now if the women are quarrelsome,
fighting, sarcastic,

627
02:26:32,438 --> 02:26:36,867
it is absolutely a hell for man.

628
02:26:38,193 --> 02:26:44,114
Instead of that, if woman knows
the essence, the honey,

629
02:26:44,315 --> 02:26:50,304
she should know how to please the husband,
to bring peace in the family.

630
02:26:50,505 --> 02:26:55,376
Now some of the husbands are drunkards
or anything – not in Sahaja Yoga.

631
02:26:55,521 --> 02:26:58,862
What pleases the husband?

632
02:27:00,374 --> 02:27:03,761
You see, in a way, it’s a trick.

633
02:27:03,962 --> 02:27:09,656
It’s a trick of a realized soul, how
to please others.

634
02:27:09,857 --> 02:27:14,720
What do we do to our husbands?
Do we try to please?

635
02:27:14,921 --> 02:27:18,581
First of all find out what he likes.

636
02:27:20,309 --> 02:27:23,276
My husband, I would say - he’s gone away,
thank God -

637
02:27:23,477 --> 02:27:26,342
he used to say, “You shouldn’t wear
any flower in your head.”

638
02:27:26,543 --> 02:27:31,085
But in Maharashtra all the married women
are supposed to wear flowers.

639
02:27:31,286 --> 02:27:36,781
Since that day I have never worn any flower
in My head.

640
02:27:36,982 --> 02:27:42,653
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, he didn’t
know what I was,

641
02:27:42,854 --> 02:27:46,209
so he said, “Don’t wear any flowers,
I don’t like.” Then he said,

642
02:27:46,410 --> 02:27:49,838
“You must wear bangles” because he comes
from a very traditional family.

643
02:27:50,039 --> 02:27:56,921
All My life I have worn bangles. It pleases
him, what’s the matter?

644
02:27:57,122 --> 02:28:00,611
Little, little things you do just to please
him,

645
02:28:00,788 --> 02:28:04,899
then he also starts thinking, “See, what
should I do for My wife?”.

646
02:28:05,100 --> 02:28:09,674
But first it must start from woman,
not from man,

647
02:28:09,875 --> 02:28:13,307
because women are responsible
for the society.

648
02:28:13,508 --> 02:28:19,786
In the western culture they had not told
what is their job is.

649
02:28:19,987 --> 02:28:24,602
Man’s job is economics, politics,
money earning.

650
02:28:24,803 --> 02:28:30,278
They have made a mess out of it, I agree
with you. It’s quite a big mess.

651
02:28:30,479 --> 02:28:34,898
But your job is to make the society.

652
02:28:35,099 --> 02:28:39,658
And to make the society, first you must
know how to keep children pleased,

653
02:28:39,859 --> 02:28:44,242
how to keep your husband pleased, how
to help and be close to them (Unclear).

654
02:28:44,443 --> 02:28:49,875
On the contrary, if you try all the time
to dominate,

655
02:28:50,076 --> 02:28:52,679
that’s not your job to dominate at all.

656
02:28:52,880 --> 02:29:01,739
Your job is to make neutralize his
domination by simple, simple things.

657
02:29:02,596 --> 02:29:08,292
I’ll give you an example. Thank God
he is not here!

658
02:29:10,002 --> 02:29:16,401
He knows, he knows I’m very, I am very
clever in certain things.

659
02:29:16,602 --> 02:29:22,189
In his office he had a gentleman. I never
used to interfere with his office.

660
02:29:22,390 --> 02:29:25,365
But there was one gentleman, good one,

661
02:29:25,566 --> 02:29:29,536
who gave up his organization and joined
another one

662
02:29:29,737 --> 02:29:33,587
because it was a private one, he was
getting more money, so he joined that.

663
02:29:33,788 --> 02:29:40,683
But there he found it was horrible, so he
wanted to come back to Shipping Corporation.

664
02:29:41,457 --> 02:29:44,420
But My husband is very particular about
rules and regulations.

665
02:29:44,621 --> 02:29:47,445
He said, “No, no, no, now I won’t have you,
I don’t want to see your face, get out”,

666
02:29:47,646 --> 02:29:54,473
this thing, that (thing). So he came to Me.
Normally, I never interfere.

667
02:29:54,674 --> 02:29:58,871
He came to Me and he said, “If You tell
him he might listen.”

668
02:29:59,072 --> 02:30:04,445
I said, “No, if I tell him he will never
listen. But I know how to do it.”

669
02:30:04,646 --> 02:30:09,152
So I told him that this gentleman came
to see Me.

670
02:30:09,353 --> 02:30:13,951
“Ha, so he’s come to the right person, now
are you going to trouble me about it?”

671
02:30:14,152 --> 02:30:18,905
I said, “No, no, no, not Me, but just think
why he came to Me.”

672
02:30:19,106 --> 02:30:23,031
He said, “Why?” “Because he thinks I’m more
generous than you are.”

673
02:30:23,232 --> 02:30:27,097
Immediately this competition.

674
02:30:32,532 --> 02:30:35,633
And that fellow got the job, he was
a great friend of his,

675
02:30:35,834 --> 02:30:38,799
even in London he was helping him a lot.

676
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:44,951
So, when we think that we have to control
our husband,

677
02:30:45,152 --> 02:30:49,653
it’s better to do it in a very simple way.

678
02:30:51,460 --> 02:30:55,356
Only on fundamentals you can put down
your foot.

679
02:30:55,557 --> 02:30:59,037
Otherwise for small, small things,

680
02:30:59,238 --> 02:31:03,821
if you go on dominating your husband
I tell you, you will miss the point.

681
02:31:04,022 --> 02:31:10,454
You have married for stupidity or
for honeymoon?

682
02:31:11,899 --> 02:31:16,676
And in the West, especially in Italy, we
have had very bad experiences of women.

683
02:31:16,877 --> 02:31:21,618
English also, I must say. English girls
also have given Me lot of trouble.

684
02:31:21,819 --> 02:31:27,359
I mean, they are banned now, because
I can’t help it.

685
02:31:27,560 --> 02:31:33,195
One girl from Sri Lanka she was married
to somebody in…

686
02:31:33,396 --> 02:31:35,767
 [Aside, maybe to a child: “Sit down,
sit down”] -

687
02:31:35,968 --> 02:31:40,543
she was married to somebody in USA.

688
02:31:40,744 --> 02:31:48,098
Imagine from that horrible Sri Lanka where
there’s everyday at least 30 murders,

689
02:31:48,299 --> 02:31:51,776
she got such a good chance to go to USA.

690
02:31:51,977 --> 02:31:59,042
Of course, USA’s also not a very great
place - but she started behaving

691
02:31:59,243 --> 02:32:05,574
as if she is a childish person and talking
to him in such a manner.

692
02:32:05,775 --> 02:32:11,214
He told Me “Mother, she is a sadist.
Whenever I telephone to her she talks to me

693
02:32:11,415 --> 02:32:16,800
in such a sarcastic manner and this
and that, that I’m surprised.”

694
02:32:17,001 --> 02:32:20,712
I said, “A lady from Sri Lanka? I can’t
believe it!”

695
02:32:20,913 --> 02:32:25,987
Then he told Me what she talked to him and
how she talked to him. I was amazed.

696
02:32:26,188 --> 02:32:29,754
I mean, no man would be happy to hear
all these things.

697
02:32:29,938 --> 02:32:36,472
But she thought she was very friendly, and
she was joking or something like that.

698
02:32:36,673 --> 02:32:40,612
This doesn’t work out in marriage.

699
02:32:41,545 --> 02:32:51,178
Man doesn’t want a wife to be on the horse
and beating with a whip.

700
02:32:51,379 --> 02:32:54,307
Why has he married?

701
02:32:54,508 --> 02:33:01,493
For the happiness, for the joy, for
the sweetness of a woman.

702
02:33:05,092 --> 02:33:07,484
 It’s a very important thing I wanted
to talk

703
02:33:07,685 --> 02:33:12,653
because so many of women are thinking
that they are something great.

704
02:33:12,854 --> 02:33:16,104
Some of them have some money, some of them
have some jobs,

705
02:33:16,305 --> 02:33:21,216
but first job is to keep the society
very happy

706
02:33:21,417 --> 02:33:25,708
and to keep your husband happy –
is the first job.

707
02:33:26,190 --> 02:33:31,734
If a woman cannot keep the husband happy,
she is no good for us.

708
02:33:31,901 --> 02:33:36,972
She is no good Sahaja Yogini. This is
a place, like a man

709
02:33:37,173 --> 02:33:40,317
who is working in the office, he has
to keep his boss pleased.

710
02:33:40,518 --> 02:33:44,451
If he doesn’t please his boss, he is
useless, he’s thrown out of.

711
02:33:44,652 --> 02:33:51,038
In the same way a woman has to think about
the husband, in a very kindly manner,

712
02:33:51,239 --> 02:33:56,662
because this is her job, this is why
she is marrying.

713
02:33:56,863 --> 02:34:01,158
Otherwise she should not marry, she can do
what she likes.

714
02:34:02,319 --> 02:34:07,667
It’s a difficult thing to convince anyone

715
02:34:07,844 --> 02:34:11,827
because, you see, men are right-sided,
they are hot-tempered.

716
02:34:12,028 --> 02:34:19,361
But I have told you just now how to capture
their anger.

717
02:34:21,500 --> 02:34:25,490
I’ve seen also in the films, you see
all romantic scenes going on –

718
02:34:25,691 --> 02:34:28,363
it never happens, there’s nobody is
like that,

719
02:34:28,564 --> 02:34:31,381
you see, it’s all absurd things you see,

720
02:34:31,582 --> 02:34:36,918
so you expect them to be Clark Gable
or somebody, it’s not so.

721
02:34:39,097 --> 02:34:45,086
You have to love, you have to take
your husband into your heart first.

722
02:34:45,287 --> 02:34:50,147
This is your duty, otherwise what else
are you doing?

723
02:34:54,358 --> 02:34:57,496
I was shocked, a girl from Sri Lanka -
and this boy has said,

724
02:34:57,697 --> 02:35:01,444
“Mother, you can kill me, but I will not
have that girl here,

725
02:35:01,645 --> 02:35:05,941
because she is not joy-giving.”
It’s a fact.

726
02:35:06,142 --> 02:35:11,375
So if your wife is like that supposing -
now I am telling men.

727
02:35:13,013 --> 02:35:16,406
The trick of the trade is, if your wife
is like that,

728
02:35:16,607 --> 02:35:20,088
try to understand why she does it.

729
02:35:20,289 --> 02:35:25,093
What is her problem, why is she
dominating you?

730
02:35:25,294 --> 02:35:30,881
Or you think she is dominating you. Most
of the times, most of the men who talk,

731
02:35:31,082 --> 02:35:35,994
“Oh, wives are like this, wives”… they are
very dominating.

732
02:35:36,195 --> 02:35:41,675
Why is she dominating you, what’s wrong
with you, that she is dominating?

733
02:35:41,876 --> 02:35:47,855
If you introspect, you’ll find that you
give very little time to her.

734
02:35:48,056 --> 02:35:52,308
Now, the other part is, there was one lady,
she wanted to have a divorce.

735
02:35:52,509 --> 02:35:56,467
I said, “Why?” “Because he goes to work
all the time

736
02:35:56,668 --> 02:36:01,122
and he is not there and this and that.”

737
02:36:01,438 --> 02:36:04,779
But I said, “If you divorce, then you will
never be with him.

738
02:36:04,980 --> 02:36:10,385
So why do you want to have a divorce?
At least, at least he gives you some time,

739
02:36:10,586 --> 02:36:14,614
but if you divorce, then he’ll never be
with you, so why do you ask for divorce?”

740
02:36:14,815 --> 02:36:17,605
I can’t understand the logic.

741
02:36:17,806 --> 02:36:22,303
I mean women should not be brainless,
isn’t it - to say such a thing.

742
02:36:22,504 --> 02:36:28,015
If you want to divorce your husband
for this – it’s absurd.

743
02:36:28,681 --> 02:36:37,285
Now, for men it is important that they
should give some time,

744
02:36:37,486 --> 02:36:43,635
pay some attention and get some things
that they like.

745
02:36:45,242 --> 02:36:47,828
Now, I’ll give you again My own example.

746
02:36:48,029 --> 02:36:52,844
My husband never brought any flowers
for Me, you all bring flowers for Me,

747
02:36:53,045 --> 02:36:58,393
but he never brought any flowers for Me,
whether it was birthday or anything.

748
02:36:58,594 --> 02:37:03,138
Then I realized that this man has no sense
of flowers.

749
02:37:03,339 --> 02:37:08,603
He doesn’t know what is a rose or what is
any other flower.

750
02:37:08,804 --> 02:37:12,967
And he might bring something which is
horrible, you know.

751
02:37:13,168 --> 02:37:16,423
Maybe (a) cactus he might bring.

752
02:37:17,074 --> 02:37:23,077
It’s better he doesn’t bring anything,
because that would be insulting, isn’t it?

753
02:37:23,278 --> 02:37:26,908
And then one day he admitted, “I don’t know
anything about flowers,

754
02:37:27,109 --> 02:37:32,178
now will you tell me – except for roses,
I don’t know anything.”

755
02:37:32,363 --> 02:37:36,147
And you’ll be amazed, even roses, he misses
out (for that? Indistinct).

756
02:37:36,348 --> 02:37:38,955
So, with such an ignorance of things,

757
02:37:39,156 --> 02:37:44,071
if your husband doesn’t do, it shows
consideration.

758
02:37:45,591 --> 02:37:52,928
But men should try to know what a woman
likes, what she wants.

759
02:37:53,129 --> 02:37:57,709
Moreover, men have their own style
of thinking.

760
02:37:57,917 --> 02:38:06,145
Now, to give My own example again,
better (it) is.

761
02:38:06,408 --> 02:38:09,257
He buys always very expensive things.

762
02:38:09,458 --> 02:38:13,693
So, I’ve told him, “Don’t buy anything
for Me.” So, “You don’t like?”

763
02:38:13,894 --> 02:38:18,945
“No, no, I like it, but too much of these
too expensive things, why should you buy?”

764
02:38:19,146 --> 02:38:24,528
So, he is very fond of buying these kind
of sweaters from that Scotch House,

765
02:38:24,729 --> 02:38:29,671
very expensive they are, £250 each,
you know.

766
02:38:29,872 --> 02:38:34,976
I don’t know how many I have, how many
in black, how many, you see.

767
02:38:35,177 --> 02:38:40,940
I told him, “I’ll get it from Switzerland,
they are much cheaper there” and all that.

768
02:38:41,141 --> 02:38:45,291
Then another is he wants to buy a cashmere
coat for Me, always.

769
02:38:45,468 --> 02:38:49,110
I must be having at least 10 of them
hanging,

770
02:38:49,311 --> 02:38:53,033
but he likes to give that only – all right.

771
02:38:53,234 --> 02:38:57,889
So, I’m passing out them to My daughters,
granddaughters and all that.

772
02:38:58,090 --> 02:39:02,043
Then what to do now? You see, men –
he doesn’t mean anything bad,

773
02:39:02,244 --> 02:39:07,864
but because he doesn’t know, doesn’t know.

774
02:39:08,065 --> 02:39:12,897
First thing he did was to, when in India,
before going to the Puja,

775
02:39:13,098 --> 02:39:19,765
he went to buy a sari for Me. The one
of My nephews went with him.

776
02:39:19,966 --> 02:39:26,503
So he says, “Give me the most expensive
sari that you have.”

777
02:39:26,704 --> 02:39:29,637
So these people thought there’s somebody
has come now.

778
02:39:29,838 --> 02:39:34,507
The shopkeepers could understand this
gentleman doesn’t know anything of it.

779
02:39:34,708 --> 02:39:38,282
So they brought out a sari, said,
“This is the most expensive,

780
02:39:38,483 --> 02:39:42,392
the price is 45,000 rupees” – in those
days this was.

781
02:39:42,593 --> 02:39:45,644
“All right, all right, you give me. I have
a card, will you take the card?”

782
02:39:45,845 --> 02:39:49,216
“Yes, yes, we’ll take the card.” He bought
the sari for Me.

783
02:39:49,417 --> 02:39:55,198
It is so heavy, it is so heavy that it was
something…

784
02:39:55,399 --> 02:40:00,570
[Hindi aside]

785
02:40:00,780 --> 02:40:04,010
That… what do you call that, arm.. – you
wear… Some yogis: Armor.

786
02:40:04,224 --> 02:40:08,146
Shri Mataji: Eh? Some yogis: Armor.
Shri Mataji: Very heavy, you know.

787
02:40:08,347 --> 02:40:12,238
I said, “Now what?”
He said, “You must wear for the Puja."

788
02:40:12,439 --> 02:40:16,760
I was walking like a giant, you know.

789
02:40:22,989 --> 02:40:27,312
There’s a description of your Mother is
“Ati saumya Ati raudra” –

790
02:40:27,513 --> 02:40:31,548
She is extremely soft and extremely
terrible.

791
02:40:31,749 --> 02:40:34,825
But, I don’t know with that sari,
how I sat!

792
02:40:35,026 --> 02:40:39,257
I sat in one place glued down into that.

793
02:40:39,458 --> 02:40:44,717
Now to get up I didn’t know how to get up
with that weight on My body. You see?

794
02:40:44,918 --> 02:40:50,429
And then I brought it and put it properly
in a box and this and that.

795
02:40:50,630 --> 02:40:54,017
So he said, “When are you wearing that
next?” “Now,” I said, “Please,

796
02:40:54,218 --> 02:40:58,151
I’ve kept it nicely for one wedding,
I’ll wear sometime.”

797
02:40:58,352 --> 02:41:04,247
I promised him and kept it there, because
he doesn’t understand about saris.

798
02:41:05,001 --> 02:41:07,525
I know he doesn’t understand about saris.

799
02:41:07,690 --> 02:41:12,571
So if he doesn’t understand, whatever
he buys, I say “All right”.

800
02:41:12,772 --> 02:41:15,455
And he spends so much money on those
things, you know,

801
02:41:15,656 --> 02:41:21,984
45,000 rupees for such a sari...
[Hindi words]

802
02:41:22,208 --> 02:41:28,737
So he doesn’t understand what is real,
what is unreal, nothing – doesn’t matter.

803
02:41:28,938 --> 02:41:33,811
You have to just see his heart, how he
is giving you,

804
02:41:34,012 --> 02:41:37,251
with what love he is giving you. He doesn’t
understand.

805
02:41:37,452 --> 02:41:40,549
So what can you do, poor man, you know.

806
02:41:40,749 --> 02:41:46,241
I always buy suit lengths for him or suits
for him, I always – Myself.

807
02:41:46,442 --> 02:41:49,387
Once he said, “All right, I’m going to buy
this time.” I said, “Better buy.”

808
02:41:49,588 --> 02:41:53,075
He bought such a horrible one and he went
to the office

809
02:41:53,276 --> 02:41:58,232
and everybody said, “Sir, this is not
your taste.”

810
02:42:01,228 --> 02:42:03,420
So he threw it away, he said, “I will never
buy now,

811
02:42:03,621 --> 02:42:06,365
can you, better go and buy for myself.”

812
02:42:06,566 --> 02:42:11,681
See, it’s - but the trouble is if women
take interest and know

813
02:42:11,882 --> 02:42:14,581
what sort of color he will like and this
and that.

814
02:42:14,782 --> 02:42:20,733
And also public opinion is very important
for men, for example what the public says.

815
02:42:20,934 --> 02:42:25,619
Like once I painted My drawing room
with a very nice color,

816
02:42:25,820 --> 02:42:31,457
pink and black film mixed – very nice.
Because it’s a sign of warmth.

817
02:42:31,643 --> 02:42:33,255
He said, “What is this color you have
put it?

818
02:42:33,456 --> 02:42:36,545
You should have done this and that”,
he started shouting.

819
02:42:36,746 --> 02:42:40,516
I said, “All right, tomorrow we are having
a party, after that I’ll change it.”

820
02:42:40,717 --> 02:42:44,923
Next day the people came in, they said,
“Oh, what a color, what a color,

821
02:42:45,124 --> 02:42:49,701
how have you made this color, how did…?”
He started looking at Me.

822
02:42:49,902 --> 02:42:54,832
I said, “Should I remove it?”
“No, no, no, no, no, it’s very nice.”

823
02:42:56,986 --> 02:43:01,261
Men care for public opinion very much
and you should see

824
02:43:01,446 --> 02:43:07,394
that you create a good public opinion
in his presence,

825
02:43:07,595 --> 02:43:11,530
so that he’ll appreciate you. All these
are tricks, you see?

826
02:43:11,731 --> 02:43:17,718
I tell you, men are very simple, but you
have to understand them.

827
02:43:17,919 --> 02:43:20,304
Sometimes they get angry, doesn’t matter.

828
02:43:20,505 --> 02:43:25,185
Actually, if they are angry with somebody
else, they will come and put it on you.

829
02:43:25,360 --> 02:43:29,550
It’s better, because if they do anything
to others, they’ll beat them.

830
02:43:29,750 --> 02:43:32,655
You are not going to beat (them).

831
02:43:33,733 --> 02:43:38,972
If you understand few things about men,
it can work out.

832
02:43:39,173 --> 02:43:42,100
Of course, some are very miserable
husbands, I know,

833
02:43:42,301 --> 02:43:46,074
and some miserable wives – for them we have
divorce allowed

834
02:43:46,275 --> 02:43:50,084
in our Sahaja Yoga, we have divorce
for them.

835
02:43:50,285 --> 02:43:53,943
So that is the thing I wanted to tell you,

836
02:43:54,144 --> 02:43:58,867
that you should make a very good housewife,
a very good Gruha Lakshmi.

837
02:43:59,068 --> 02:44:06,085
Now, why I am telling you this, that I am
suffering from Gruha Lakshmi’s chakra,

838
02:44:06,286 --> 02:44:10,760
and all the doctors have told Me it is
because in the collective

839
02:44:10,968 --> 02:44:19,210
Gruha Lakshmis are not all right, because
they are not good housewives.

840
02:44:19,411 --> 02:44:24,791
Like I’ll tell you now we have Swiss women.
They are very good, agreed about that,

841
02:44:24,992 --> 02:44:31,414
but very fond of cleanliness. Swiss are
mad after cleanliness, women, women.

842
02:44:31,621 --> 02:44:35,104
You can’t talk to them even for five
minutes. If you are sitting there

843
02:44:35,305 --> 02:44:37,871
they are picking up this, picking up that,
picking up that, picking all the…,

844
02:44:38,072 --> 02:44:43,145
cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. It’s very
difficult, Swiss women.

845
02:44:43,346 --> 02:44:45,889
Now, I was… - Eritrea,

846
02:44:46,090 --> 02:44:51,294
Alga told Me that the women of Eritrea
are known to be Swiss women.

847
02:44:51,495 --> 02:44:58,105
So, doesn’t matter if the house is little
untidy, if there’s something fallen off.

848
02:44:58,306 --> 02:45:01,127
In India no woman will do that.

849
02:45:01,328 --> 02:45:05,687
Now, the guests are sitting and she’s
with the Hoover.

850
02:45:11,337 --> 02:45:17,315
Like another thing is, like anything
breaks, say,

851
02:45:17,516 --> 02:45:20,748
supposing the thermometer breaks –
in India they’ll say, “Very good,

852
02:45:20,949 --> 02:45:25,138
now there will be no temperature,
thermometer’s broken.”

853
02:45:25,339 --> 02:45:28,237
But I’ve seen in the West, it’s very
surprising,

854
02:45:28,438 --> 02:45:34,723
supposing some coffee spills, I’m a guest,
immediately they’ll bring the Hoover,

855
02:45:34,924 --> 02:45:38,315
bring something to clean it –
in the presence of the person.

856
02:45:38,516 --> 02:45:41,336
Now, if a glass breaks, finished.

857
02:45:41,537 --> 02:45:45,397
It’s not important. This is a very subtle
type of materialism, I think,

858
02:45:45,598 --> 02:45:49,408
that the person is sitting there, who is
a guest,

859
02:45:49,609 --> 02:45:56,754
and why are you trying to do all these
things in her presence or in his presence?

860
02:45:56,955 --> 02:46:01,008
But this Western women never understand.

861
02:46:01,209 --> 02:46:07,223
Another thing is, now, you go to an Indian
house. Their color scheme is different.

862
02:46:07,423 --> 02:46:12,874
If you go to south Indians theirs is
different. Everybody has their own taste.

863
02:46:13,075 --> 02:46:16,586
As soon as they will enter –
Western women –

864
02:46:16,787 --> 02:46:20,898
“What a color scheme! What a thing you
have bought! Oh my God, this is horrible.”

865
02:46:21,099 --> 02:46:25,753
Immediately they will criticize
on the face.

866
02:46:25,954 --> 02:46:31,154
So another point is that you must always
consider the feelings of others.

867
02:46:31,355 --> 02:46:39,735
Woman is there to give proper understanding
of feelings of others, what they think.

868
02:46:39,936 --> 02:46:47,369
Or they go to an Indian house which
will be smelling of their food, “Huh”.

869
02:46:47,570 --> 02:46:50,783
They’ll eat the same food, they’ll enjoy
the food,

870
02:46:50,984 --> 02:46:56,791
but they’ll try to show, to show that it is
something lower.

871
02:46:56,992 --> 02:46:59,645
This is very Western, I must say.

872
02:46:59,846 --> 02:47:06,685
If somebody is wearing a dress, immediately
they’ll pass a remark.

873
02:47:06,963 --> 02:47:12,582
Very Western idea. You will not find
good Indians doing that,

874
02:47:12,783 --> 02:47:16,554
I don’t know about the modern Indians
what sort of things they are.

875
02:47:16,755 --> 02:47:20,834
But immediately they’ll say things which
will hurt.

876
02:47:21,035 --> 02:47:24,567
This is not the way a woman should look.

877
02:47:24,768 --> 02:47:29,478
On the contrary, always praise -
what’s the harm?

878
02:47:29,679 --> 02:47:35,905
By praising something you are not losing
your business.

879
02:47:36,106 --> 02:47:43,619
By saying, “What a nice thing, what a nice
sari, what nice clothes” – what’s the harm?

880
02:47:43,820 --> 02:47:48,449
You’ll enjoy your sweetness, you know?
Really enjoy your sweetness.

881
02:47:48,650 --> 02:47:52,770
It’s not telling lies, not to be that
honest also necessary.

882
02:47:52,971 --> 02:47:56,015
Because you don’t like something you must
say, “I don’t like it.”

883
02:47:56,216 --> 02:48:06,419
This word has to go from Sahaja Yoga.
“I like this and I don’t like that."

884
02:48:06,620 --> 02:48:14,225
If I, say, saying that, how many will
remain in Sahaja Yoga?

885
02:48:18,628 --> 02:48:23,831
So it’s very important to drop this
“I like it, I don’t like it.”

886
02:48:24,016 --> 02:48:26,443
Who are you to like or not like?

887
02:48:26,644 --> 02:48:31,581
What about your Spirit? What about
your heart?

888
02:48:31,782 --> 02:48:37,972
So again the same thing comes to,
that women have to have a heart,

889
02:48:38,181 --> 02:48:45,976
very large heart, beautiful heart.
And your Guru is a Mother,

890
02:48:46,177 --> 02:48:50,762
so you have to be wonderful mothers
and wonderful wives

891
02:48:50,963 --> 02:48:55,472
and should have very, very large hearts.

892
02:48:59,072 --> 02:49:07,683
So that all this selfishness, even this
bank will collapse if you do that.

893
02:49:07,884 --> 02:49:11,088
It is existing because we have small
hearts.

894
02:49:11,289 --> 02:49:17,103
If you have large hearts this will
collapse – isn’t it?

895
02:49:19,620 --> 02:49:24,801
I have said it, especially because I’ve had
many complaints about the women

896
02:49:25,002 --> 02:49:32,015
who are married here, some Indian women
also. That’s why I’m telling you.

897
02:49:32,216 --> 02:49:37,072
Best reports are about Russian women
I must say,

898
02:49:37,273 --> 02:49:40,379
very, very good reports about them.

899
02:49:40,580 --> 02:49:45,483
They are very satisfied souls, they want
very little, they are not greedy.

900
02:49:45,684 --> 02:49:48,843
It’s surprising, communism has done
so much good to them.

901
02:49:49,044 --> 02:49:55,015
It’s not communism, but the extremities
of communism has thrown them

902
02:49:55,216 --> 02:50:02,814
into that area where they don’t have any
sense of possession, they don’t have.

903
02:50:03,015 --> 02:50:05,866
Their government said, “All right, you can
have your flats and look after them.”

904
02:50:06,067 --> 02:50:09,632
Said, “We don’t want to have, you have it.”

905
02:50:10,200 --> 02:50:12,915
Government servants were told that
“you can have your cars”.

906
02:50:13,116 --> 02:50:16,802
Said, “No, no, we don’t want, you’d
better have.”

907
02:50:17,003 --> 02:50:21,794
Because just to own the car is such
a headache – they know.

908
02:50:21,995 --> 02:50:25,742
Let the government have the headache.
They are not, you know,

909
02:50:25,943 --> 02:50:30,212
sort of people who are even conscious
of possessiveness.

910
02:50:30,413 --> 02:50:33,643
Of course, now, they had some funny people.

911
02:50:33,844 --> 02:50:38,244
I’m forgetting his name, who was finance
minister you had,

912
02:50:38,476 --> 02:50:44,757
and he was in Geneva, where he learned
all the tricks of the trade

913
02:50:44,927 --> 02:50:48,071
and he brought forth lots of reforms,
so-called.

914
02:50:48,272 --> 02:50:53,777
So now Leningrad and Moscow have become
very expensive places –

915
02:50:53,978 --> 02:50:56,498
thanks to Swiss influence.

916
02:50:56,699 --> 02:51:01,673
So this has happened there also, but still
the people are very good,

917
02:51:01,880 --> 02:51:07,357
and the ladies who come from there, even
Romanian girls are very much respected,

918
02:51:07,558 --> 02:51:12,140
now everybody wants Romanian or Russians,

919
02:51:17,378 --> 02:51:21,393
or from Kiev. But this time they didn’t
come,

920
02:51:21,594 --> 02:51:26,919
we are sorry they are not here, I’m missing
them all.

921
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:34,021
Lastly, I have to tell you that there’s
a very good book, Arun Apte has written.

922
02:51:35,337 --> 02:51:38,499
This is the book. You all should buy it.

923
02:51:38,700 --> 02:51:42,114
I don’t know, what is the price you have
put it?

924
02:51:42,315 --> 02:51:45,633
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi about
the book and its price]

925
02:52:08,053 --> 02:52:11,319
Alright. So, those who want to have
this book should apply.

926
02:52:11,520 --> 02:52:15,100
There are only five, are here,
very good book.

927
02:52:15,301 --> 02:52:20,150
So, you will understand about Indian music.

928
02:52:20,351 --> 02:52:26,549
It is said that this music has come
from Omkara.

929
02:52:26,983 --> 02:52:33,864
And it is very sort of – sensible music.

930
02:52:34,065 --> 02:52:40,316
Now, I think all those musicians who sang
before Me,

931
02:52:40,517 --> 02:52:45,253
who were singing western song, was alright.

932
02:52:45,454 --> 02:52:50,588
But what is missing in that: melody.
It’s not melodious.

933
02:52:50,789 --> 02:52:54,031
You see, is like little bit you sing,
then you sing this,

934
02:52:54,232 --> 02:52:57,829
then you shout, then you bring it down,
then do like this.

935
02:52:58,030 --> 02:53:02,098
And they think that they have to sing
through their heart.

936
02:53:02,299 --> 02:53:05,746
They have to express the feeling
of their heart.

937
02:53:05,947 --> 02:53:10,187
Now, supposing somebody is dejected,
so he sings the song of dejection.

938
02:53:10,388 --> 02:53:14,497
Then another one who is talking about love,
he starts to sing a song.

939
02:53:14,674 --> 02:53:20,195
He may not be, but artificially they want
to produce that effect.

940
02:53:20,396 --> 02:53:28,258
There is no need; to sing in parts,
like one word, then one word,

941
02:53:28,459 --> 02:53:32,095
there’s no melody in it, there’s no flow
in it.

942
02:53:32,296 --> 02:53:38,695
And, while, Russian songs, though they
were folk songs, were very melodious.

943
02:53:38,896 --> 02:53:43,065
But don’t worry, Americans are invading
that part also.

944
02:53:43,266 --> 02:53:45,824
They are having all this horrible music
there.

945
02:53:46,025 --> 02:53:51,445
Now, the music means, it should please you.
It should give you more entertainment;

946
02:53:51,646 --> 02:53:55,831
not to make you unhappy, not to make
you sad.

947
02:53:56,012 --> 02:54:03,154
If you have all these feelings within you,
then you should try to say like this:

948
02:54:03,322 --> 02:54:07,661
“Yes, there is problem, but I’ll get
over it.”

949
02:54:07,862 --> 02:54:11,761
Because you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
to show the victory;

950
02:54:11,962 --> 02:54:14,592
the victorious nature of yours,
in your music.

951
02:54:14,793 --> 02:54:19,750
I’m not talking about others; they go on
crying, weeping and singing.

952
02:54:19,950 --> 02:54:24,731
But there is no melody first of all, it is
just part, part, part, part.

953
02:54:24,956 --> 02:54:28,391
Even the orchestra, which I was surprised:
it all goes like this

954
02:54:28,592 --> 02:54:33,086
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”, then it goes
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”.

955
02:54:33,287 --> 02:54:42,963
But Indian orchestra, you will see,
is melodious. It flows like a river.

956
02:54:43,164 --> 02:54:49,608
So, this difference is very bad. So, I would
request all the musicians who are singing,

957
02:54:49,809 --> 02:55:00,637
the singing doesn’t mean that you use words
which nobody can understand.

958
02:55:00,838 --> 02:55:05,384
Words must be clear-cut and the melody
must be there.

959
02:55:05,585 --> 02:55:11,571
Now, in Indian ragas, there is melody
but words are not important.

960
02:55:11,771 --> 02:55:13,712
So, you enjoy the tune and everything,

961
02:55:13,913 --> 02:55:17,822
whether you know the language or not,
doesn’t matter.

962
02:55:18,023 --> 02:55:22,196
So, when you can combine melody
with western music,

963
02:55:22,397 --> 02:55:25,841
you will see how different it will be.

964
02:55:27,978 --> 02:55:31,562
And this book will teach you. This is
a very good book,

965
02:55:31,763 --> 02:55:34,407
which you should have, and which you should
understand

966
02:55:34,608 --> 02:55:43,843
that how the music can cure you,
music can give you joy,

967
02:55:44,044 --> 02:55:50,341
what is the basic, the essence of music.
And then you can flower it out.

968
02:55:50,542 --> 02:55:55,779
I am sure, if Indian musicians take
to western music,

969
02:55:55,940 --> 02:56:01,983
will be much better than to western music
as it is.

970
02:56:03,432 --> 02:56:07,061
I can’t understand, these people are
so famous

971
02:56:07,262 --> 02:56:11,244
and people think they are very well-earning
and all that.

972
02:56:11,445 --> 02:56:16,839
In America, anybody can earn like that,
but to make it a proper music,

973
02:56:17,040 --> 02:56:19,788
I think you must have the basis
of Indian music.

974
02:56:19,989 --> 02:56:23,681
Then you can expand it as you like.

975
02:56:23,882 --> 02:56:30,006
Now, please try to buy this book,
to understand Indian music.

976
02:56:30,207 --> 02:56:34,471
There’s no price yet given, but it won’t be
much more than normal,

977
02:56:34,672 --> 02:56:40,950
so next time, I think for Diwali Puja, they
might bring more. Eh? Ganapatipule.

978
02:56:41,238 --> 02:56:47,802
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi to know
when the book will be available]

979
02:56:48,334 --> 02:56:50,673
Accha.

980
02:56:50,874 --> 02:56:55,641
I will try to get more of these, but this
you must really read,

981
02:56:55,842 --> 02:57:02,215
because you will know what is the essence
of music, alright?

982
02:57:02,416 --> 02:57:12,137
And, lastly, today is the 4th day
of Navaratri

983
02:57:12,564 --> 02:57:20,700
and they have given Me - some of them
are names which are really horrid,

984
02:57:24,738 --> 02:57:29,641
but they must be people who have suffered
so much

985
02:57:29,842 --> 02:57:36,931
and they asked Mother to kill those
horrible rakshasas.

986
02:57:37,132 --> 02:57:45,381
Now in a way, it all will kill in its
natural course, I know that.

987
02:57:45,582 --> 02:57:52,318
If you people take to sense, because you
are the ones who can do it.

988
02:57:52,519 --> 02:58:00,839
If you do not try to acquire things which
you don’t want, unnecessary things.

989
02:58:01,040 --> 02:58:09,106
If you try to reduce all these things
and take to something natural

990
02:58:09,307 --> 02:58:14,214
and love the Mother Earth, I am sure
it will work out.

991
02:58:14,389 --> 02:58:18,505
The Mother Earth herself will work it out.

992
02:58:18,706 --> 02:58:25,330
You know this earthquake. Now nobody
is going in the church.

993
02:58:25,531 --> 02:58:30,887
But I didn’t do anything. It’s the Mother
Earth.

994
02:58:31,260 --> 02:58:38,059
Now nobody goes in the church. What -
I didn’t do anything, I would not.

995
02:58:38,260 --> 02:58:45,836
I was sorry for the art-pieces gone, but
see now how the nature is working out.

996
02:58:46,037 --> 02:58:52,542
Now Islamic people, these Islamic people
from Indonesia onward,

997
02:58:52,743 --> 02:58:58,532
all these people are suffering from
the smoke – I didn’t do that.

998
02:58:58,733 --> 02:59:02,039
Because when you try to do something wrong

999
02:59:02,240 --> 02:59:06,336
it comes back to you. Action has
a reaction.

1000
02:59:09,018 --> 02:59:13,305
So, your faces should be Sahaj. You should
be Sahaj.

1001
02:59:13,506 --> 02:59:19,390
You shouldn’t look like strained people.
I can’t understand.

1002
02:59:19,591 --> 02:59:25,455
You are Sahaj and be in that Sahaj mood.
I’m sorry I’ve taken so much time,

1003
02:59:25,656 --> 02:59:29,312
but tomorrow I won’t be able to speak
all these things to you.

1004
02:59:29,513 --> 02:59:34,374
And you should try to think about it,
that “Our Mother loves me,

1005
02:59:34,575 --> 02:59:38,759
She wants us to have a good family, She
wants us to look after our children.”

1006
02:59:38,960 --> 02:59:43,898
So, I have advised all the men, as well
as the women.

1007
02:59:44,099 --> 02:59:47,539
It’s better to be hen-pecked, there’s
no harm.

1008
02:59:47,740 --> 02:59:51,227
But hen-pecked doesn’t mean they are
hen-pecked.

1009
02:59:51,428 --> 02:59:56,993
See, they are – just to please your wife,
what’s the harm?

1010
02:59:58,767 --> 03:00:04,841
But that doesn’t mean if she dominates you.
That’s not the thing.

1011
03:00:05,042 --> 03:00:09,386
Like, “Come to my father’s house, I must
go to my mother’s house”.

1012
03:00:09,586 --> 03:00:13,293
All these kind of things you should not
permit.

1013
03:00:13,494 --> 03:00:18,577
But women should also understand,
her family is more important

1014
03:00:18,778 --> 03:00:23,361
than father, mother, even Mataji.

1015
03:00:24,662 --> 03:00:29,591
Because I’ll be only happy to see a happy
family.

1016
03:00:30,531 --> 03:00:32,804
So, thank you very much.
