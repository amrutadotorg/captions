Public Program. Brasilia, Brazil, 1992-1015

00:01:28.668 --> 00:01:33.770
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:01:40.413 --> 00:01:45.437
We have to know that truth is what it is.

00:01:48.434 --> 00:01:53.372
We cannot change it, we cannot transform it,

00:01:55.724 --> 00:01:58.941
we cannot read about it.

00:02:01.785 --> 00:02:08.129
Also, unfortunately at this human awareness, we cannot know it.

00:02:16.706 --> 00:02:21.529
We have to become the Spirit.

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:29.634
Whatever I am going to tell you today,

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:34.092
you need not believe me blindfolded.

00:02:42.852 --> 00:02:50.360
But keep your mind open as a scientist has.

00:02:55.364 --> 00:02:59.660
Treat is as a hypothesis.

00:03:02.428 --> 00:03:07.424
And if it turns to be the truth,

00:03:07.624 --> 00:03:12.397
you have to accept it as honest people.

00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:21.556
Because it is for the benevolence

00:03:24.025 --> 00:03:28.739
of your own, benevolence of your country

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:33.017
and benevolence of the whole world.

00:03:39.656 --> 00:03:43.563
We are born in a very special time today.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.722
These are the times when lots of things are going to happen.

00:03:55.384 --> 00:04:00.020
And people will be in illusions,

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.869
won't understand what is right and what is wrong.

00:04:11.407 --> 00:04:18.430
But at this time only, there are many who are seeking the truth.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.880
They are not sticking on to any one book

00:04:28.096 --> 00:04:30.919
or sticking on to one ideology.

00:04:31.119 --> 00:04:36.150
But they want to know what is beyond.

00:04:42.621 --> 00:04:47.262
They are a special category of people.

00:04:49.628 --> 00:04:53.741
William Blake, a great poet, has said that

00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:58.668
"Men of God will be born in those days.

00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:09.335
And they will find their divinity

00:05:09.535 --> 00:05:14.031
and they will make others divine."

00:05:19.281 --> 00:05:27.180
Believe Me, you all have your divinity intact within yourself.

00:05:32.407 --> 00:05:37.033
It cannot be tarnished,

00:05:37.234 --> 00:05:42.788
it cannot be destroyed whatever you might have done to yourself.

00:05:46.735 --> 00:05:51.125
Because it is eternal in nature.

00:05:54.235 --> 00:06:00.008
Only question is of manifesting this divinity

00:06:03.922 --> 00:06:10.563
through your ascent into a new realm of reality.

00:06:15.786 --> 00:06:19.911
You are all ready for it.

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:25.950
There is no more fasting or suffering needed.

00:06:29.318 --> 00:06:34.958
There is no need to change you dress and you foods.

00:06:38.452 --> 00:06:44.061
It is the internal happening that is important.

00:06:48.152 --> 00:06:53.272
You have been already told about

00:06:53.472 --> 00:06:58.183
the subtle system that works it out.

00:07:03.652 --> 00:07:09.631
When this power called Kundalini, which resides in the sacrum bone,

00:07:09.831 --> 00:07:15.230
awakens, She passes through six centers.

00:07:24.691 --> 00:07:27.738
The Greeks perhaps knew it was a sacrum bone,

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:32.150
so they call it a sacrum.

00:07:37.595 --> 00:07:43.891
And this is awaken just like a seed is sprouted,

00:07:47.921 --> 00:07:53.014
because the seed has the built in quality to sprout.

00:07:58.137 --> 00:08:02.832
All living process is spontaneous.

00:08:06.582 --> 00:08:10.288
So there are two things we should know

00:08:10.488 --> 00:08:14.566
when we are seeking the truth.

00:08:24.324 --> 00:08:30.756
The first one is that you are not this body, this mind,

00:08:30.956 --> 00:08:34.686
this ego, this conditioning,

00:08:34.886 --> 00:08:39.183
but you are the pure Spirit.

00:08:48.393 --> 00:08:54.091
The second truth is that there is an All Pervading Divine Power

00:08:54.291 --> 00:08:58.924
which does all the living work.

00:09:06.092 --> 00:09:11.366
You see these beautiful plants, it is a miracle.

00:09:15.255 --> 00:09:19.310
But we take it for granted.

00:09:20.958 --> 00:09:25.743
We have these eyes which are, which is a camera.

00:09:25.943 --> 00:09:30.794
It is a miracle, but we take it for granted.

00:09:35.833 --> 00:09:42.352
Then look at our brain, which is such a great computer,

00:09:42.552 --> 00:09:46.583
but we take it for granted.

00:09:51.505 --> 00:09:55.849
If you ask a doctor who runs your heart,

00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:05.906
he will say it is the autonomous nervous system.

00:10:09.219 --> 00:10:12.836
Now, who is this auto?

00:10:14.352 --> 00:10:21.868
So there is some power which is working out all these living miracles.

00:10:26.236 --> 00:10:30.130
So the first truth is that you are the pure Spirit

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:38.986
and the second one is that there is this All Pervading Power of Divine Love.

00:10:47.226 --> 00:10:52.858
We cannot feel it, we cannot see it, but it exists.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:05.139
Now when this Power rises through these centers,

00:11:05.339 --> 00:11:09.425
It nourishes those centers.

00:11:14.871 --> 00:11:25.012
All human problems are because of these centers.

00:11:29.347 --> 00:11:32.928
And if these centers are put right,

00:11:33.128 --> 00:11:38.644
all your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problems

00:11:38.845 --> 00:11:43.173
can be solved.

00:11:49.587 --> 00:11:53.688
It is as simple as that.

00:11:55.946 --> 00:12:01.308
Also I would like to tell you in short

00:12:01.508 --> 00:12:06.102
what happens to your awareness.

00:12:10.462 --> 00:12:15.793
When this Kundalini connects you to the mains

00:12:15.994 --> 00:12:19.001
as this instrument when connected to the mains

00:12:19.202 --> 00:12:22.946
has some meaning,

00:12:33.602 --> 00:12:37.899
so you too have some meaning.

00:12:40.095 --> 00:12:47.282
But it makes you stand in the present.

00:12:52.149 --> 00:12:57.684
We are all the time jumping on the cusp of the thoughts

00:12:57.884 --> 00:13:03.032
which are coming from the past or from the present.

00:13:12.324 --> 00:13:16.944
But then when the Kundalini rises, She separates those thoughts

00:13:17.144 --> 00:13:21.308
and the space in between is the present.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.313
So you develop a new awareness

00:13:33.514 --> 00:13:37.531
called as thoughtless awareness.

00:13:42.782 --> 00:13:44.902
You are aware, fully aware,

00:13:45.102 --> 00:13:50.219
but there is no thought in your mind to disturb you.

00:13:56.101 --> 00:14:01.289
Thus you achieve peace within yourself.

00:14:05.299 --> 00:14:09.885
There a many people who have got prices for peace,

00:14:10.093 --> 00:14:14.444
but I am not seeing that peace within themselves.

00:14:22.568 --> 00:14:29.216
So this peace within us is existing there, we become that peace.

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.495
And such a person emits peace

00:14:39.695 --> 00:14:44.250
and neutralizes violence and anger.

00:14:51.973 --> 00:14:58.965
Now the nature of the Spirit is that Spirit is the universal being.

00:15:03.628 --> 00:15:07.996
We are also universal.

00:15:08.597 --> 00:15:12.421
If you cut a part of your body,

00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:17.218
you'll find every one has the same bone,

00:15:17.418 --> 00:15:22.128
the same muscle, the same artery.

00:15:30.403 --> 00:15:36.528
So we are all inside universal.

00:15:41.576 --> 00:15:46.279
We laugh the same way, we smile the same.

00:15:50.464 --> 00:15:54.432
The difference is just skin deep.

00:15:56.271 --> 00:16:01.294
That is also just to create variety,

00:16:01.495 --> 00:16:05.737
otherwise it would have been boring.

00:16:12.308 --> 00:16:15.996
But this universal like nature within us

00:16:16.197 --> 00:16:22.478
is manifested when the light of the Spirit comes into our consciousness.

00:16:30.596 --> 00:16:37.364
We transcend all the barriers of races, cast, community,

00:16:37.564 --> 00:16:41.697
religion and nations.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:55.816
In short, you become part and parcel of the whole.

00:16:59.943 --> 00:17:05.295
Like the microcosm become the macrocosm.

00:17:08.476 --> 00:17:12.227
But it is a becoming, it is not just a lecture

00:17:12.428 --> 00:17:14.728
or telling something or a false certificate,

00:17:14.928 --> 00:17:19.068
but is the becoming that is important.

00:17:28.478 --> 00:17:33.132
And you develop a balance in your life.

00:17:36.765 --> 00:17:40.874
Moreover you become innately righteous.

00:17:44.501 --> 00:17:48.978
For example, you're maybe a Hindu, Christian, Muslim, anything.

00:17:49.179 --> 00:17:53.475
You can commit any sin.

00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:02.685
But once you become the Spirit,

00:18:02.885 --> 00:18:08.268
you become above everything that is wrong.

00:18:14.478 --> 00:18:23.432
You get your sense of security and your power.

00:18:24.919 --> 00:18:29.684
Sense of security and your power of love.

00:18:33.339 --> 00:18:37.214
This power is flowing in you then.

00:18:40.706 --> 00:18:45.210
With that power, you become extremely compassionate

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:49.442
and extremely dynamic.

00:18:53.817 --> 00:18:58.320
But when the light of the Spirit comes into you attention,

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.731
your attention becomes enlightened

00:19:07.923 --> 00:19:12.313
Whenever you put your attention, it acts.

00:19:18.334 --> 00:19:22.954
the another great thing about the Spirit is that

00:19:23.154 --> 00:19:27.834
It is the source of absolute knowledge.

00:19:34.065 --> 00:19:37.951
Like you have ten children together, tie their eyes

00:19:38.151 --> 00:19:42.791
ask them about somebody: "What is wrong with this person?"

00:19:51.985 --> 00:19:56.107
Now, all your centers are in your hand reflected,

00:19:56.308 --> 00:20:01.782
sympathetic, five, six, seven centers.

00:20:05.852 --> 00:20:10.212
They all will raise one finger like this.

00:20:17.595 --> 00:20:22.548
Ask the gentleman: "Have you got heart trouble?"

00:20:27.616 --> 00:20:31.084
He will say: "Hoe do you know?"

00:20:32.969 --> 00:20:36.984
Because everyone will know the same thing.

00:20:41.109 --> 00:20:44.034
As you all can see Me sitting here, that is all.

00:20:44.234 --> 00:20:48.367
You see the same thing.

00:20:52.687 --> 00:20:57.644
So then there are no dogmas, no theories, nothing of the kind,

00:20:57.844 --> 00:21:01.906
but actually you see the reality.

00:21:09.153 --> 00:21:13.200
Then who is going to quarrel?

00:21:14.309 --> 00:21:18.317
How can there is difference of opinion,

00:21:21.051 --> 00:21:25.176
There cannot be wars then at all.

00:21:28.215 --> 00:21:35.239
But the Spirit is the ocean of joy.

00:21:38.349 --> 00:21:43.118
And after you get your Self Realization,

00:21:43.318 --> 00:21:47.935
you feel as if you are swimming in the ocean of joy.

00:21:56.786 --> 00:22:02.387
You get separated from your problems and you see them as a witness.

00:22:08.087 --> 00:22:12.134
And then you can solve them much better.

00:22:14.517 --> 00:22:19.798
Without getting involved into it or upset about it.

00:22:25.199 --> 00:22:32.098
I am so very happy to be in Brazil, specially in Brasilia.

00:22:36.607 --> 00:22:41.388
No doubt, this is a very spiritual place.

00:22:44.373 --> 00:22:48.743
There are great seekers and one day this may become

00:22:48.943 --> 00:22:53.865
the greatest spiritual nucleus for the whole world.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:09.277
You can get your Realization in hardly ten minutes time.

00:23:13.963 --> 00:23:18.877
In this short time, I cannot tell you all about it.

00:23:23.479 --> 00:23:26.232
In this hall, say, there are so many lights

00:23:26.432 --> 00:23:31.924
and only you put on the switch and you get the lights there.

00:23:38.449 --> 00:23:42.574
Because it is all built in.

00:23:43.769 --> 00:23:47.573
No use telling you about the history of electricity,

00:23:47.774 --> 00:23:53.230
how it was brought to Brasilia, it is all boring.

00:23:59.891 --> 00:24:04.751
So the best thing is to get your Realization.

00:24:07.243 --> 00:24:11.243
I know you have some questions in your mind.

00:24:14.282 --> 00:24:18.439
And I would love to answer them.

00:24:20.072 --> 00:24:25.486
After your Self Realization, you may change your mind.

00:24:29.617 --> 00:24:33.710
So why not get your Self Realization?

00:24:36.468 --> 00:24:40.906
You can't pay for it.

00:24:41.757 --> 00:24:46.874
It is a living process of your evolution.

00:24:51.516 --> 00:24:56.805
Without this happening, you can never be satisfied with yourself.

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:08.312
Anybody who ask money in the name of God is a hypocrite.

00:25:11.539 --> 00:25:16.664
Because God doesn't understand money and banking.

00:25:20.204 --> 00:25:24.539
It is the headache of human beings.

00:25:28.602 --> 00:25:36.055
So now, I would say that you all can get your Self Realization.

00:25:42.609 --> 00:25:47.844
But I cannot force on you because I respect your freedom.

00:25:52.794 --> 00:25:56.888
Those who want to have can get it

00:25:57.089 --> 00:26:02.886
and those who don't want to have, it cannot be.

00:26:08.707 --> 00:26:15.418
Christ has said that "The meek will inherit the Earth."

00:26:21.519 --> 00:26:26.535
So Sahaja Yoga is not meant for arrogant people

00:26:29.105 --> 00:26:34.027
nor it is meant for people who are stupid.

00:26:36.832 --> 00:26:43.144
It is meant for people who are truly seeking the truth.

00:26:47.865 --> 00:26:54.267
So I will request people who do not want to have their Realization

00:26:54.467 --> 00:26:58.498
should leave the hall.

00:27:05.326 --> 00:27:10.650
It will be very kind. And also very civil on their part

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:15.170
not to stay here and watch others.

00:27:22.323 --> 00:27:27.568
If you are sticking on to some sort of a ideology,

00:27:27.768 --> 00:27:31.908
then also is difficult.

00:27:36.111 --> 00:27:40.221
You must keep your mind open,

00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:45.584
then it works.

00:27:46.588 --> 00:27:50.674
So I said it won't take much time.

00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:55.623
And leave about half a minute

00:27:55.823 --> 00:28:00.299
for you to leave with those who wants to leave.

00:28:13.414 --> 00:28:19.272
Alright. Such a wonderful thing that no one wants to leave.

00:28:21.929 --> 00:28:24.092
Alright.

00:28:24.293 --> 00:28:28.824
So there are three conditions which are very simple.

00:28:32.687 --> 00:28:35.752
The first condition is

00:28:35.952 --> 00:28:44.299
that you all have to be absolutely self-confident

00:28:44.499 --> 00:28:50.296
that you all will get your Self Realization tonight.

00:29:01.364 --> 00:29:06.145
So the second one is follows that

00:29:06.346 --> 00:29:10.628
you are not to condemn yourself for anything,

00:29:15.822 --> 00:29:19.658
You have to forget the past.

00:29:20.634 --> 00:29:24.650
And don't feel guilty at all.

00:29:27.243 --> 00:29:29.466
If you have done committed some mistakes,

00:29:29.666 --> 00:29:34.095
after all you are human begins, you are not gods.

00:29:39.426 --> 00:29:45.707
And this All Pervading Power is a ocean of forgiveness.

00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:54.523
So all your mistakes can be easily neutralized by that.

00:30:01.404 --> 00:30:05.521
So please don't feel guilty.

00:30:07.827 --> 00:30:13.721
If you feel guilty, it works against the center on the left-handed side,

00:30:13.921 --> 00:30:17.726
this center on the left-handed side.

00:30:23.355 --> 00:30:29.233
And you can get diseases like angina, like spondylitis,

00:30:29.433 --> 00:30:33.847
could be lethargic organs.

00:30:43.067 --> 00:30:47.406
And at this time, if the centers are blocked,

00:30:47.606 --> 00:30:51.739
how will the Kundalini rises?

00:30:57.512 --> 00:30:59.512
So as they say in English language is the

00:30:59.713 --> 00:31:03.561
pain in the neck, you see that.

00:31:03.762 --> 00:31:06.973
...pain in the neck

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:20.307
So let's get rid of that pain in the neck.

00:31:26.312 --> 00:31:29.003
In short, you should be very pleasantly placed

00:31:29.203 --> 00:31:33.030
towards yourself.

00:31:37.059 --> 00:31:43.457
Because you are glorious, you are magnificent.

00:31:48.374 --> 00:31:52.073
You are fantastic.

00:31:52.273 --> 00:31:56.569
Because you are not connected, you don't know what you are.

00:32:01.365 --> 00:32:06.063
Like a, supposing in an Indian village I take a television

00:32:06.263 --> 00:32:10.344
and tell them that you can see lots of films,

00:32:10.544 --> 00:32:15.849
then he will say: "Oh, what is this box? How can you see films in this?"

00:32:29.138 --> 00:32:31.680
But once you get it connected,

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:36.068
you can see what fantastic thing it is.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:45.713
We also think about ourselves that we are just a box.

00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:54.520
But you do not know how many powers there are within you.

00:32:59.624 --> 00:33:01.612
So you should be very pleasantly placed

00:33:01.812 --> 00:33:05.420
towards yourself.

00:33:08.656 --> 00:33:12.726
Because now you have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:33:15.648 --> 00:33:19.432
That Kingdom of God is the most efficient,

00:33:19.632 --> 00:33:26.555
is the most loving organization.

00:33:33.621 --> 00:33:42.222
The third condition is even simpler that you have to forgive everyone.

00:33:48.448 --> 00:33:53.158
Many people say is very difficult to forgive.

00:33:55.541 --> 00:33:57.541
Logically, if you see,

00:33:57.758 --> 00:34:02.089
whether you forgive or you don't forgive, what do you do?

00:34:06.785 --> 00:34:09.933
You don't do anything.

00:34:10.134 --> 00:34:15.009
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

00:34:18.642 --> 00:34:22.833
Those who have troubled you and have tortured you are happy,

00:34:23.033 --> 00:34:27.767
and you are torturing yourself on their behalf.

00:34:35.215 --> 00:34:42.997
But also the center of optical chiasma is like that in the Agnya Chakra.

00:34:49.304 --> 00:34:54.760
And this will never open unless and until you forgive.

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:04.603
So you have to forgive, otherwise this won't open like this.

00:35:08.525 --> 00:35:12.005
As it is you are torturing yourself

00:35:12.205 --> 00:35:17.076
all your life and now at this very important moment,

00:35:17.276 --> 00:35:21.432
you will miss your Self Realization.

00:35:29.982 --> 00:35:35.300
So just to forgive all of them, even don't think about them.

00:35:41.022 --> 00:35:45.467
Even thinking about them is a headache.

00:35:47.701 --> 00:35:52.639
So in your heart, you should forgive all of them in general.

00:35:57.833 --> 00:36:01.935
These are the only three conditions.

00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:06.046
First is that you should be fully self-confident

00:36:06.247 --> 00:36:10.294
that you all will get your Realization.

00:36:14.825 --> 00:36:21.481
The second one is that you are not guilty at all.

00:36:24.283 --> 00:36:31.564
And the third one is we have to forgive everyone in general.

00:36:37.337 --> 00:36:43.853
Now we have to take out our shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

00:37:02.289 --> 00:37:07.429
Please sit inside otherwise, you have all to sit down.

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:11.679
Don't be standing, please.

00:37:20.227 --> 00:37:24.235
There is some room here, behind.

00:37:48.978 --> 00:37:53.619
Now those who are sitting on the chairs, not on the ground,

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.714
have to put both their feet on both the sides

00:37:56.914 --> 00:38:01.781
because left and right are two different powers.

00:38:12.232 --> 00:38:16.865
The left side power is the power of desire,

00:38:19.169 --> 00:38:23.833
And the right side one is the power of action.

00:38:26.583 --> 00:38:29.278
So now we put our left hand

00:38:29.479 --> 00:38:34.317
on our lap very comfortably.

00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:46.408
Someone has to come and show here.

00:38:47.205 --> 00:38:53.189
And the right hand we use for nourishing our centers.

00:38:57.871 --> 00:39:01.923
The left hand suggests that you are desirous

00:39:02.123 --> 00:39:07.486
of Self Realization, you have a strong desire to have Self Realization.

00:39:12.887 --> 00:39:16.410
And the right one is for the action.

00:39:16.611 --> 00:39:21.236
So first we put our right hand on our heart.

00:39:26.038 --> 00:39:30.366
In the heart resides the Spirit.

00:39:38.446 --> 00:39:43.004
So now if you become the Spirit, you become

00:39:43.204 --> 00:39:48.462
in the light of the Spirit, your own guide, your own master.

00:39:57.291 --> 00:40:02.240
So we take our hand in the upper portion of abdomen

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:06.010
on left hand side,

00:40:10.205 --> 00:40:14.627
which is the center of our mastery.

00:40:18.557 --> 00:40:23.373
Then we take our right hand in the lower portion of abdomen

00:40:23.573 --> 00:40:27.276
on left hand side,

00:40:31.573 --> 00:40:39.682
which is the center of pure knowledge of Divine Laws.

00:40:44.513 --> 00:40:50.614
Then we raise again our right hand in the upper portion of abdomen.

00:40:54.786 --> 00:40:58.613
Then on our heart.

00:40:59.168 --> 00:41:02.703
Then in the corner of our neck and our shoulder

00:41:02.903 --> 00:41:06.536
and turn our head to right.

00:41:12.993 --> 00:41:17.254
I've already told you about this center that when you feel guilty,

00:41:17.454 --> 00:41:21.259
it goes out of order.

00:41:26.485 --> 00:41:32.363
Now we take our right hand and put it across our forehead

00:41:32.563 --> 00:41:36.407
and put down our head.

00:41:40.704 --> 00:41:48.555
This is the center to forgive everyone in general.

00:41:53.375 --> 00:41:58.902
Now we take back our right hand on the back side of our head

00:41:59.102 --> 00:42:03.797
and push back our head as far as possible.

00:42:10.828 --> 00:42:15.847
This is the center where without feeling guilty,

00:42:16.047 --> 00:42:20.050
without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction,

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:25.125
you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power.

00:42:33.812 --> 00:42:36.210
Now the last center, you have to

00:42:36.411 --> 00:42:41.060
stretch your palm fully.

00:42:45.632 --> 00:42:50.671
And put the center of your palm on top of fontanel bone area

00:42:50.872 --> 00:42:55.601
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:43:02.962 --> 00:43:06.493
Now please bend your head.

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:11.076
Very important is to push back your fingers,

00:43:11.276 --> 00:43:15.244
so that there is a good pression on your scalp.

00:43:25.553 --> 00:43:35.037
Please now move your scalp clockwise seven times slowly.

00:43:44.006 --> 00:43:47.928
Please put down your hands.

00:43:49.904 --> 00:43:52.211
That is all we have to do now.

00:43:52.412 --> 00:43:54.634
We have to now close our eyes

00:43:54.834 --> 00:43:59.381
and please don't open them till I tell you.

00:44:05.968 --> 00:44:09.960
You can take out your glasses.

00:44:14.706 --> 00:44:18.757
Now, again, please put both feet apart from each other,

00:44:18.957 --> 00:44:23.707
put left hand like this and the right hand on the heart.

00:44:30.602 --> 00:44:34.829
And now please close your eyes.

00:44:37.532 --> 00:44:41.386
Here resides the Spirit,

00:44:41.586 --> 00:44:46.474
so you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself.

00:44:46.674 --> 00:44:51.620
You may call Me Mother or you may call Me Shri Mataji.

00:45:01.853 --> 00:45:08.017
Please ask Me three time in your heart: "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

00:45:20.351 --> 00:45:24.823
I already told you that if you are the Spirit,

00:45:25.023 --> 00:45:29.187
you become your own master.

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:37.612
So now, please take your right hand

00:45:37.812 --> 00:45:41.960
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:51.508
You are working only on the left hand side.

00:45:53.406 --> 00:46:02.027
Here again you have to ask a fundamental question three times:

00:46:02.227 --> 00:46:06.711
"Mother, am I my own master?"

00:46:15.152 --> 00:46:21.551
Now, I have already told you that I respect your freedom

00:46:21.751 --> 00:46:29.043
and I cannot force the pure knowledge of Divine on you,

00:46:29.243 --> 00:46:32.982
you have to ask for it.

00:46:41.121 --> 00:46:43.148
So now you have to take your right hand

00:46:43.348 --> 00:46:45.748
in the lower portion of your abdomen

00:46:45.949 --> 00:46:50.133
on the left hand side and press it and here

00:46:50.333 --> 00:46:52.774
you have to ask six times,

00:46:52.974 --> 00:46:57.368
because this center has got six petals.

00:46:57.568 --> 00:47:05.833
Please say six time: "Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

00:47:30.197 --> 00:47:35.872
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

00:47:36.072 --> 00:47:39.281
your Kundalini starts rising.

00:47:39.481 --> 00:47:49.300
So now you have to enrich your higher centers

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:54.508
with your full self-confidence.

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:13.538
So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

00:48:13.738 --> 00:48:18.098
on the left hand side and press it.

00:48:22.483 --> 00:48:28.627
Here with full confidence, you have to say ten times:

00:48:28.827 --> 00:48:33.506
"Mother, I am my own master."

00:48:56.699 --> 00:49:01.859
I have already told you the fundamental truth about you

00:49:02.059 --> 00:49:07.726
that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings,

00:49:07.926 --> 00:49:12.192
but you are the pure Spirit.

00:49:22.398 --> 00:49:28.112
So now, please raise your right hand on top of your heart

00:49:28.312 --> 00:49:34.706
and here you have to say with full confidence twelve times:

00:49:34.906 --> 00:49:40.476
"Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

00:50:01.893 --> 00:50:09.190
This All Pervading Power of Divine Love is the ocean of knowledge.

00:50:14.893 --> 00:50:23.940
It is the ocean of compassion and ocean of bliss.

00:50:27.659 --> 00:50:32.498
It is the ocean of miracles.

00:50:32.698 --> 00:50:37.604
But above all, It is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:50:40.339 --> 00:50:43.826
And all your mistakes can be easily dissolve

00:50:44.026 --> 00:50:48.425
by this ocean of forgiveness.

00:50:52.193 --> 00:50:55.798
So please forgive yourself and raise your right hand

00:50:55.998 --> 00:50:58.368
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

00:50:58.568 --> 00:51:02.373
and turn your head to right.

00:51:13.863 --> 00:51:18.042
Please turn it to right.

00:51:20.214 --> 00:51:25.678
Now here you have to say with full self-confidence:

00:51:25.878 --> 00:51:31.300
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

00:51:47.834 --> 00:51:51.087
I've already told you that

00:51:51.287 --> 00:51:57.146
logically whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything.

00:52:03.106 --> 00:52:09.817
But if you don't forgive, the you play into wrong hands all your life.

00:52:13.345 --> 00:52:17.004
And at this juncture, if you don't forgive,

00:52:17.204 --> 00:52:19.567
your Agnya Chakra won't open

00:52:19.767 --> 00:52:25.603
and the Kundalini will not be able to penetrate through it.

00:52:32.574 --> 00:52:37.171
So you have already tortured yourself all your life and now

00:52:37.371 --> 00:52:41.957
at this great moment, you miss your Self Realization.

00:52:49.781 --> 00:52:52.831
So now say in your heart,

00:52:53.031 --> 00:52:55.917
not how many times, but from your heart:

00:52:56.117 --> 00:53:03.094
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general." Don't think about them.

00:53:23.807 --> 00:53:27.248
Now you have to take your hand on the back side of your head

00:53:27.448 --> 00:53:30.920
and push back your head as far as possible.

00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:35.670
Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:42.315
just for your satisfaction, you have to say,

00:53:57.101 --> 00:54:01.287
say from your heart, not how many times:

00:54:05.553 --> 00:54:09.345
"Oh Divine Power, if I have done any mistakes,

00:54:09.545 --> 00:54:14.194
knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

00:54:33.125 --> 00:54:37.768
Now, the last center, is very important,

00:54:37.968 --> 00:54:42.226
we have to stretch our palm fully.

00:54:48.317 --> 00:54:52.430
And now we have to put our center of our palm

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:56.973
on top of fontanel bone area.

00:55:02.925 --> 00:55:07.457
Now stretch back your fingers, that's important.

00:55:10.582 --> 00:55:14.527
And please put down your head as far as possible.

00:55:20.036 --> 00:55:32.561
Here I again cannot cross over your freedom.

00:55:37.806 --> 00:55:48.312
Again you have to ask Me to give you Self Realization.

00:55:53.727 --> 00:55:57.808
So now move your scalp slowly

00:55:58.009 --> 00:56:00.979
clockwise seven times saying:

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:06.883
"Mother, please give me Self Realization", seven times.

00:57:26.478 --> 00:57:30.244
Please take down your hands.

00:57:32.525 --> 00:57:36.883
And open your eyes, please.

00:57:38.391 --> 00:57:42.047
Please put both the hands towards Me like this.

00:57:49.213 --> 00:57:53.025
Like this, not like that.

00:57:54.197 --> 00:57:58.572
And watch Me without thinking.

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:05.176
Now bend your head and see with your left hand

00:58:05.377 --> 00:58:10.739
if there's a cool, warm or a hot breeze like wave

00:58:10.939 --> 00:58:14.439
coming out of your own head.

00:58:24.877 --> 00:58:29.830
Put your hand on top of your head, but away from it.

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:38.009
Some people get it too far.

00:58:41.727 --> 00:58:45.532
Now please put the left hand towards Me like this.

00:58:48.173 --> 00:58:50.863
And bend your head and now see with your right hand

00:58:51.063 --> 00:58:55.895
if there's a cool, warm or a hot breeze like wave

00:58:56.095 --> 00:58:59.860
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

00:59:09.023 --> 00:59:12.697
If it is warm or hot, it means you are not forgiving,

00:59:12.898 --> 00:59:17.346
so please forgive.

00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:27.018
I cannot forgive for you, you have to forgive yourself.

00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:34.777
Now, please put right hand.

00:59:34.978 --> 00:59:39.048
Bend your heads, bend your heads.

00:59:42.767 --> 00:59:49.012
And see with your left hand, if there's a cool breeze like waves

00:59:49.212 --> 00:59:55.509
or hot or warm coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:00:03.497 --> 01:00:06.266
Now, please do it.

01:00:06.466 --> 01:00:10.458
Put both the hands towards the sky.

01:00:13.763 --> 01:00:17.536
And push back your head.

01:00:19.982 --> 01:00:26.396
Now, ask anyone of these three questions three times.

01:00:32.579 --> 01:00:40.754
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:00:40.954 --> 01:00:49.102
Or "Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of Love, Divine Love?"

01:00:54.643 --> 01:00:59.229
Or "Is it Brahma Chaitanya."

01:00:59.503 --> 01:01:03.792
Anyone of these questions, you can ask three times.

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:13.575
Now take down your hands.

01:01:20.847 --> 01:01:23.901
Put your hands like this.

01:01:28.276 --> 01:01:32.089
You can feel your silence within yourself.

01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:42.975
Now, all those who have felt cool breeze on their fingertips,

01:01:43.175 --> 01:01:46.615
or hot or warm breeze on their fingertips,

01:01:46.815 --> 01:01:54.232
or the same on their hands or out of their fontanel bone area,

01:01:54.432 --> 01:01:58.893
please raise both your hands.

01:02:10.699 --> 01:02:14.561
Please raise both.

01:02:14.761 --> 01:02:18.839
That is Brasilia. May God Bless you.

01:02:20.472 --> 01:02:25.808
I bow to you all. You all have started your saintly life.

01:02:31.363 --> 01:02:35.379
Every where, all of you have got it.

01:02:37.637 --> 01:02:41.765
May God bless you all.

01:02:41.965 --> 01:02:48.918
There is to be - it is to be understood that you have gone beyond your mind.

01:02:53.490 --> 01:02:57.740
So don't argue and don't doubt.

01:03:01.052 --> 01:03:05.313
We have here a very good center for you,

01:03:05.513 --> 01:03:10.560
where you must learn how to make this connection perfect.

01:03:18.388 --> 01:03:26.271
All the knowledge about your subtle system, everything you will know.

01:03:32.456 --> 01:03:37.838
But one should know that you can only grow in collectivity.

01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:48.501
Supposing one nail is cut out of My body, it will never grow.

01:03:52.987 --> 01:03:59.115
So you have to be humble about it and you should, all of you,

01:03:59.315 --> 01:04:02.940
master this art.

01:04:08.577 --> 01:04:14.873
You will have the powers to raise the Kundalini of others and awaken them.

01:04:19.338 --> 01:04:23.448
You can cure people, you can do so many things.

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:30.549
And for all this, you don't have to pay at all.

01:04:34.221 --> 01:04:36.681
You don't have to be also obliged,

01:04:36.882 --> 01:04:41.182
because it is your own power it has worked it.

01:04:45.855 --> 01:04:50.121
It is your honest seeking it has worked out.

01:04:54.707 --> 01:04:57.717
I will definitely come next year here again for a longer period.

01:04:57.918 --> 01:05:01.864
por um período mais longo.

01:05:05.299 --> 01:05:09.740
I would love you all to grow into your wisdom

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:14.283
like a great tree of spirituality.

01:05:20.971 --> 01:05:24.596
May God Bless you all.
