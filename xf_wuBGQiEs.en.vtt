00:14:41.068 --> 00:14:58.408
I bow to all the seekers of truth. It gives
me immense pleasure to come to Cardiff again

00:14:58.433 --> 00:15:09.103
for this programme of Sahaja Yoga. They must
have explained to you what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:09.103 --> 00:15:17.263
That is, ‘Saha’ is ‘with’ and ‘Ja’
is ‘born’–it is born with you and all

00:15:17.263 --> 00:15:25.513
of us have a birth right to get this spontaneous
yoga, that is the union with the Divine. Ascent

00:15:25.513 --> 00:15:34.203
to the Divine is our birth right. Only thing
we must reach that state of awareness where

00:15:34.203 --> 00:15:49.142
we become aware of higher seeking within us.
First as a human being we seek food, then

00:15:49.142 --> 00:15:58.953
protection, house, possessions, money, power-and
then we find that all these things even if

00:15:58.953 --> 00:16:07.343
you have achieved you have not been able to
achieve what you wanted-that is the state

00:16:07.343 --> 00:16:17.063
of joy, and thus you start seeking furthermore
to find out what should be that state in which

00:16:17.063 --> 00:16:20.712
you remain in complete joy.

00:16:20.712 --> 00:16:29.782
Many people have no idea as to what to expect
and also they are quite naive about the structure

00:16:29.782 --> 00:16:38.982
or the nature of this tree of life which is
built within us. Now what I’m going to tell

00:16:38.982 --> 00:16:48.362
you is the Knowledge of the Roots. So far
with our developments we only know the Knowledge

00:16:48.362 --> 00:16:56.463
of the Tree, but we have to know the Knowledge
of the Roots which sustains this tree. If

00:16:56.463 --> 00:17:02.933
we do not know that Knowledge, it may be one
day this great tree that we see which seems

00:17:02.933 --> 00:17:10.983
to be quite secure, may completely be destroyed.
So it is important for everyone to have that

00:17:10.983 --> 00:17:19.333
Knowledge of the Roots within ourselves and
within our society, within human beings as

00:17:19.333 --> 00:17:20.243
a whole.

00:17:20.243 --> 00:17:27.143
Now we have to realise that we have come to
this state of human awareness up to a point

00:17:27.143 --> 00:17:35.323
where we find we are lost. These days in the
modern times, we are very much confused because

00:17:35.323 --> 00:17:41.623
there are so many ideas afloat. All these
ideas confuse us and we don’t know where

00:17:41.623 --> 00:17:47.733
to look, what to see, the value systems have
changed rapidly so drastically that it is

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:54.383
difficult for us to keep up and cope with
it. Despite all that, it seems that there

00:17:54.383 --> 00:18:03.583
must be some hope for us: after all God, God
who has created this Universe must be worried

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:09.703
about this creation. After all, He has to
do something about it. It’s no use only

00:18:09.703 --> 00:18:17.423
our worrying about it, or being aware of the
shocks, the future shocks that we may receive

00:18:17.423 --> 00:18:29.183
because of the mistakes we have committed
before. It is He who has made us and it is

00:18:29.183 --> 00:18:36.233
He who works out everything for us. For example,
we believe that we do this and we do that.

00:18:36.233 --> 00:18:45.953
What we do is the work of the dead to the
dead. We do not do any living work. We cannot

00:18:45.953 --> 00:18:54.753
transform one flower into a fruit. But you
see in different seasons we find different

00:18:54.753 --> 00:19:01.593
types of flowers, different types of fruits
coming in, we find every child that is born

00:19:01.593 --> 00:19:07.783
has something to do with the society, with
the parents, with the country where it is

00:19:07.783 --> 00:19:16.102
born, it is such a big selection that it is
impossible to find out who could have done

00:19:16.102 --> 00:19:25.862
it with such tremendous powers of accuracy.
A child is conceived in a Mother’s womb,

00:19:25.862 --> 00:19:31.272
is a very big miracle itself to all the medical
science because normally everything that is

00:19:31.272 --> 00:19:38.153
foreign is thrown out of the body–but when
the foetus is formed in the body, it is not

00:19:38.153 --> 00:19:44.533
thrown out, on the contrary it is preserved,
looked after, nourished and thrown out at

00:19:44.533 --> 00:19:50.903
the time when it is fully matured. This is
such a remarkable thing that we see everyday,

00:19:50.903 --> 00:19:54.563
but somehow or other we take everything for
granted.

00:19:54.563 --> 00:20:00.262
Human beings if they look at themselves, they’ll
be amazed how beautifully we are made. This

00:20:00.262 --> 00:20:07.772
is something special about us. We know so
many things more than the animals do. An animal

00:20:07.772 --> 00:20:14.933
can pass through a dirty lane, he cannot understand
any architecture, he cannot understand any

00:20:14.933 --> 00:20:23.612
colours, any beauty, but we human beings have
so many ideas and also abstract ideas. But

00:20:23.612 --> 00:20:32.232
beyond this is a state where you reach into
an absolute state-so far still we live in

00:20:32.232 --> 00:20:38.852
a relative world. Whatever we know is so relative
that it is difficult to decide really what

00:20:38.852 --> 00:20:45.102
is right and what is wrong. Relatively we
can say alright, this is little right and

00:20:45.102 --> 00:20:51.362
this is little wrong. But we cannot absolutely
say that this is right and this is wrong.

00:20:51.362 --> 00:20:59.452
Here then we start thinking-ate we really
fully evolved? We are not. We are not evolved.

00:20:59.452 --> 00:21:06.042
And when I say this you should take it as
an hypothesis with a very open mind of a scientist.

00:21:06.042 --> 00:21:11.602
And then if it is proved you have to accept
it as a law, not before that.

00:21:11.602 --> 00:21:20.862
It is very hard to believe that we can become
the Spirit. This is one of the big myths of

00:21:20.862 --> 00:21:28.302
modern times and many a times when I speak
about becoming the Spirit people say that

00:21:28.302 --> 00:21:36.772
-how can you say like that, how can it be
that easy-but it is a living process of our

00:21:36.772 --> 00:21:43.702
evolution and if it is done by the power.
of a living God, then it has to be very simple,

00:21:43.702 --> 00:21:51.072
has to be very easy-like if you have to sprout
a seed You just Put it in the Mother Earth,

00:21:51.072 --> 00:21:55.852
and the seed has a capacity to become the
plant and the Mother Earth has a capacity

00:21:55.852 --> 00:22:03.063
to sprout it. In the same way, this happening
has to take place. Today that time has come.

00:22:03.063 --> 00:22:10.343
That time has come, the time of judgement
has come and at this time we have to see that

00:22:10.343 --> 00:22:16.653
we’ll be judging ourselves, but not by some
sort of a weight or some sort of an authority,

00:22:16.653 --> 00:22:21.843
but by something which is within us which
we call as the Kundalini:, is placed in the

00:22:21.843 --> 00:22:27.862
triangular bone called as sacrum. Just see,
Greeks knew about it, that’s why they called

00:22:27.862 --> 00:22:33.992
this bone as sacrum. But what is this bone
in the biblical understanding-it is the reflection

00:22:33.992 --> 00:22:40.582
of the Holy Ghost. We have to understand that
if there is a Father God and a Son-there has

00:22:40.582 --> 00:22:46.482
to be a Mother. So this is the primordial
Mother who is the Holy Ghost and She is reflected

00:22:46.482 --> 00:22:55.662
within us as the Kundalini. In our heart is
reflected the God Almighty. It is He who is

00:22:55.662 --> 00:23:02.352
the witness of whatever we are doing. This
power manifests everything within us and then

00:23:02.352 --> 00:23:10.153
resides in a sleeping state in that triangular
bone and is said to be residual because it

00:23:10.153 --> 00:23:18.673
has not yet manifested itself. This is the
power of our desire which is true and the

00:23:18.673 --> 00:23:26.363
only desire we have which is pure. Because
all other desires are not true. If they were

00:23:26.363 --> 00:23:31.463
true, any one of them when satisfied, we would
not have desired for anything else. But it

00:23:31.463 --> 00:23:37.153
is not so as you know in economics that wants
in general are not satiable. So you want to

00:23:37.153 --> 00:23:46.393
have something today, then we want to have
another thing tomorrow. But once the desire

00:23:46.393 --> 00:23:51.963
of becoming one with the Divine manifests
then you don’t want anything-you want to

00:23:51.963 --> 00:24:01.503
give. Like you want to be the light and then
you become the light that emits light and

00:24:01.503 --> 00:24:08.803
emancipates others -raises them to the level
of their Spirit by giving them peace and bliss.

00:24:08.803 --> 00:24:13.753
Today we talk of peace. But how can we have
peace with the people who are so disturbed.

00:24:13.753 --> 00:24:19.133
We have to have transformation of human beings,
who should feel peaceful within themselves

00:24:19.133 --> 00:24:24.843
and should feel that they are the ones who
are part and parcel of the whole. But this

00:24:24.843 --> 00:24:29.923
should not be a conception or a mental projection.
Because mental projection can disappear in

00:24:29.923 --> 00:24:36.063
no time. Like you would believe that this
particular person is my friend but you discover

00:24:36.063 --> 00:24:39.143
that he is not and the whole mental projection
drops out.

00:24:39.143 --> 00:24:43.943
So all mental projections are artificial,
they last for a short time and disappear.

00:24:43.943 --> 00:24:49.433
But this is a happening that has to take place
within us when we become the Spirit. It is

00:24:49.433 --> 00:24:56.633
the question of you feeling that Spirit on
your central nervous system. So in our evolutionary

00:24:56.633 --> 00:25:03.873
process whatever happened to us has happened
to our central nervous system, and that is

00:25:03.873 --> 00:25:08.753
what Christ has exactly said when he said
you are to be born again. He didn’t say

00:25:08.753 --> 00:25:13.253
that you just ask somebody to do an exercise
of putting some water on top of your head

00:25:13.253 --> 00:25:19.053
and then say now you are baptised. No. There
is a true baptism of the real awakening of

00:25:19.053 --> 00:25:24.093
this Kundalini passing through these six centres
above, piercing through your fontanel bone

00:25:24.093 --> 00:25:29.613
area and giving you the true experience of
the breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of

00:25:29.613 --> 00:25:37.523
your own head and this cannot be by just putting
water by somebody. It has to happen within

00:25:37.523 --> 00:25:42.653
yourself and you have to seek the truth, and
not something that just satisfies you for

00:25:42.653 --> 00:25:43.373
the time being.

00:25:43.373 --> 00:25:48.363
That’s why even if you profess any religion
we find we don’t have much transformation

00:25:48.363 --> 00:25:55.663
within. But here you become the Spirit, the
fight of the Spirit we can say, on our central

00:25:55.663 --> 00:26:01.483
nervous system just guides you. Like first
of all when this Kundalini rises She passes

00:26:01.483 --> 00:26:07.733
through these centres on the physical level
and you get physical health. Some people say,

00:26:07.733 --> 00:26:12.303
Mother, you heal us or cure us-is not true.
It is your own Kundalini. It’s your own

00:26:12.303 --> 00:26:13.503
Mother within you.

00:26:13.503 --> 00:26:22.453
Everybody has an individual Mother, when She
rises, She actually fulfils the need of every

00:26:22.453 --> 00:26:30.413
subtle centre that supplies to your gross
centres, because these are the abstract or

00:26:30.413 --> 00:26:35.903
we can say are the subtle centres which are
first fulfilled and they look after your plexuses,

00:26:35.903 --> 00:26:41.923
that’s how you get heated automatically.
It is you who heal yourself, not me. I’m

00:26:41.923 --> 00:26:47.173
just a catalyst you can say, like one enlightened
light can enlighten another one , and once

00:26:47.173 --> 00:26:52.953
you are enlightened, you can enlighten another
person. That is how it is. So there is no

00:26:52.953 --> 00:26:58.913
obligation. There is no give and take. It’s
like we are part and parcel of the whole.

00:26:58.913 --> 00:27:05.923
Now we have, say, a problem on a finger. What
do we do? We just rub that finger and find

00:27:05.923 --> 00:27:12.753
that we feel better. But have we any way obliged
this finger? Because it is part and parcel

00:27:12.753 --> 00:27:19.073
of you it just spontaneously has happened
and has worked out. In the same way it happens

00:27:19.073 --> 00:27:23.333
to you also that you get this Realisation
automatically.

00:27:23.333 --> 00:27:29.883
Now the mass evolution has started and there
are many who have got Realisation like that.

00:27:29.883 --> 00:27:36.573
I’m happy to know in England also we have
at least two to three thousand people who

00:27:36.573 --> 00:27:43.613
are realised very well, who are established,
but there may be much more who have got Realisation,

00:27:43.613 --> 00:27:48.703
but then you have to establish yourself like
a tree. Once you establish like a tree you

00:27:48.703 --> 00:27:53.583
can give Realisation to others and you can
give them peace and the whole thing is such

00:27:53.583 --> 00:27:58.233
a transformed personality-because the second
thing that happens to you when you become

00:27:58.233 --> 00:28:05.143
the Spirit that you become so powerful that
nothing dominates you. Nothing dominates you.

00:28:05.143 --> 00:28:11.313
There is no habit that can dominate you. No
temptation can dominate you and you become

00:28:11.313 --> 00:28:16.933
very powerful, But at the same time you are
extremely compassionate, you are extremely

00:28:16.933 --> 00:28:22.453
kind, so it is a very compassionate power
that you develop of the Spirit and you become

00:28:22.453 --> 00:28:28.873
a new personality, a wonderful personality.
We know when we have Christmas, when we have

00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:35.933
Easter, we give eggs to people. This denotes
the Resurrection of Christ as our own Resurrection,

00:28:35.933 --> 00:28:43.583
that an egg has to become the bird. It is
symbolic of that. That we are like eggs when

00:28:43.583 --> 00:28:49.343
we are closed, when we have this ‘I ness
within us, and then suddenly when this happens

00:28:49.343 --> 00:28:56.413
to us, this egg becomes the bird and you become
completely free and you know what freedom

00:28:56.413 --> 00:29:06.273
is. Freedom is no licence but freedom which
, is absolutely not curbing anybody’s freedom

00:29:06.273 --> 00:29:13.673
nor is giving you any bondages. It is something
so great it should happen to all of us.

00:29:13.673 --> 00:29:20.133
We have had many great saints in this country,
I would like to mention William Blake who

00:29:20.133 --> 00:29:26.263
was a great saint and who saw all this happening
Ion ‘time back, two hundred years back-and

00:29:26.263 --> 00:29:34.313
He wrote about it that such and such time
will come when men of God will become prophets

00:29:34.313 --> 00:29:39.743
and these prophets will have powers to make
others prophets. He has said so many things

00:29:39.743 --> 00:29:47.913
that time has come today for England to rise
as He has desired and described. That time

00:29:47.913 --> 00:29:54.503
is here today now at this time you should
get your Realisation-you’ll realise that

00:29:54.503 --> 00:30:01.073
now you have entered into that Kingdom of
God. We have also many people, we can say

00:30:01.073 --> 00:30:06.853
even Mohammed Sahib has said that “At the
time of Resurrection your hands will speak.”

00:30:06.853 --> 00:30:12.033
Exactly this happens, that when you get your
Realisation, when the Kundalini comes up,

00:30:12.033 --> 00:30:20.123
and She touches the seat of God here immediately
in your heart the reflection of God starts

00:30:20.123 --> 00:30:28.473
emitting cool vibrations from your hands also.
When it starts happening you are amazed that

00:30:28.473 --> 00:30:35.133
all around you feel the subtle power. of God,
the power of His love, what we call the all-pervading

00:30:35.133 --> 00:30:41.323
Brahma, what we call the Chaitanya, that’s
how you start feeling it and once you start

00:30:41.323 --> 00:30:48.403
feeling it you are amazed that how you can
find about anything. You become like a computer.

00:30:48.403 --> 00:30:54.063
As soon as you want to find out whether it
is right or wrong, say you want to ask a question,”

00:30:54.063 --> 00:30:58.653
Is there God?”-Immediately you’ll find
there will be cool breeze coming out. But

00:30:58.653 --> 00:31:03.773
if You want to find about Hitler, you might
get a blister or a heat on your hands and

00:31:03.773 --> 00:31:09.173
you’ll feel horrible about it. So that is
how you start working it out and gradually

00:31:09.173 --> 00:31:15.563
you become absolutely wise in the sense you
become absolute and you understand.

00:31:15.563 --> 00:31:20.163
Just now if you look at a person how will
you find out who is right and who is wrong?

00:31:20.163 --> 00:31:25.852
But when this happens to you, you don’t
have to know about him. On his centres you

00:31:25.852 --> 00:31:31.183
know because you become collectively conscious.
You become, again I say, it is a becoming,

00:31:31.183 --> 00:31:36.033
You become collectively conscious, you can
know about your own centres and you can know

00:31:36.033 --> 00:31:41.303
about the centres of others. And when you
feel the centres of others, you know what

00:31:41.303 --> 00:31:46.343
the problem is, you don’t talk like other
people talk, but you talk in the language

00:31:46.343 --> 00:31:51.103
of centres. This is exactly what happened
to the disciples of Christ when they were

00:31:51.103 --> 00:31:55.943
blessed by the Holy Ghost, the cool breeze
came on them, they started speaking in strange

00:31:55.943 --> 00:32:00.943
languages. And the same thing you’ll find
with Sahaja Yogis that they speak in a strange

00:32:00.943 --> 00:32:06.233
language in the sense that they talk in the
language of the centres, and they start using

00:32:06.233 --> 00:32:10.763
their hands in a way because the hand has
got the power flowing, and they use it to

00:32:10.763 --> 00:32:15.503
bind it up and that looks very strange and
at that time also it looked very strange so

00:32:15.503 --> 00:32:20.733
people started saying that they are mad people,
they are doing some sort of funny actions.

00:32:20.733 --> 00:32:27.203
So all this happens, it’s very simple, has
to happen, the time has come, it is the blossom

00:32:27.203 --> 00:32:36.433
time; at that time I would say, in the early
days, it was not the blossom time but it was

00:32:36.433 --> 00:32:41.443
the time when there were hardly one or two
flowers on the tree of life, but today is

00:32:41.443 --> 00:32:47.953
different-there are so many seekers all over
the world though misled by all kinds of things,

00:32:47.953 --> 00:32:55.373
because as soon as they come to know, the
negatives, that God has decided to work it

00:32:55.373 --> 00:33:00.313
out, they have come in the market and they
are selling their goods. One must know that

00:33:00.313 --> 00:33:07.193
you cannot sell God in the market. Secondly
you cannot organise God. But we are so much

00:33:07.193 --> 00:33:12.253
used to it, paying for everything that we
can’t understand that we can get something

00:33:12.253 --> 00:33:13.882
without paying.

00:33:13.882 --> 00:33:21.382
But think of a seed which we sow in the Mother
Earth. What do we do? Do we pay anything?

00:33:21.382 --> 00:33:26.873
Does it understand money? Do living processes
understand money? Do you think God understands

00:33:26.873 --> 00:33:35.393
money? You can’t pay for it. If you put
this one small little test,-99 per cent of

00:33:35.393 --> 00:33:40.382
these bogus people will disappear from the
scene. But we don’t think, we don’t use

00:33:40.382 --> 00:33:45.313
our brains, we go headlong into it. On the
contrary they will ask thousands of questions

00:33:45.313 --> 00:33:50.183
to me but to these people who have taken thousands
of pounds and have finished them off they

00:33:50.183 --> 00:33:55.413
don’t ask any question. They just go headlong
into it, ruin their lives, get into epilepsies

00:33:55.413 --> 00:34:00.413
and all kinds of diseases, then they come
to me and I find that they are in a very bad

00:34:00.413 --> 00:34:04.353
shape. But doesn’t matter, whatever has
happened has happened. Nobody should feel

00:34:04.353 --> 00:34:09.583
guilty about it. That’s one condition of
Sahaja Yoga is that we should not feel guilty.

00:34:09.583 --> 00:34:11.323
We have to be in the present.

00:34:11.323 --> 00:34:15.903
Forget the past. We are not to think about
the past. And at this present moment this

00:34:15.903 --> 00:34:18.143
should happen to all of us.

00:34:18.143 --> 00:34:22.993
Now the subject matter is so great and the
knowledge is like an ocean, I cannot in this

00:34:22.993 --> 00:34:28.083
short time tell you all about it, I would
say there must be at least two thousand lectures

00:34:28.083 --> 00:34:34.963
in English language which I have given all
over the places, and I would request you first

00:34:34.963 --> 00:34:36.973
of all to get the light within you.

00:34:36.973 --> 00:34:44.123
Like this room when it is not lighted and
if I tell you about this room it will be a

00:34:44.123 --> 00:34:49.323
headache, and if I tell you about the electricity,
the history of the electricity, the connections

00:34:49.323 --> 00:34:53.882
of electricity, the sources of electricity,
you’ll be fed up. First of all, let us have

00:34:53.882 --> 00:34:58.013
the light. Once we have the light it’s much
easier to understand, and you’ll have much

00:34:58.013 --> 00:35:03.713
patience. So I would request you first to
have the light We can try it, I cannot guarantee,

00:35:03.713 --> 00:35:10.093
I must say, I cannot guarantee to everyone-is
something that works out but may not work

00:35:10.093 --> 00:35:18.303
out also. As far as possible, we should try
and let us see what happens to us and if it

00:35:18.303 --> 00:35:27.903
works out that would be really a very great pleasure for me. May God bless you all.
