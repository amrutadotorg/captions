00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.850
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.290
Yesterday we talked about

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.550
the power that lies within us which is the power of the Holy Ghost

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.030
and which has to give us the Self-realization.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.290
Now, one may say that we have never heard about such a thing,

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:45.610
it's a very new idea but this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.930
In the West we have the knowledge of the tree

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:00.070
and somebody must also have the knowledge of the roots - there's nothing objectionable about it.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.290
Like in the East people learnt about Science and other knowledge

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:16.770
that the Western people gathered, in the same way, when this tree of life grew so big

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.050
there was a search inside as well and when that search started, they in their meditative

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.670
processes, they found out that within us lies the power which can give us Self-realization.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.310
But this very, very ancient discovery - this is nothing new that I'm telling you.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.470
Only thing is that today the time has come, the blossom time has come,

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.230
that many can get Self-realization.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.510
But Self-realization history is very, very ancient

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.750
that it is said that about 16000 years back

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.350
the king of all the Gods, called Indra, got his realization. I don't know in Greeks,

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.650
Greek language what He is called as but He is the one, who got his realization in a place called Chidendra

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.510
means, He was made, the hole was made into His head - Chidendra.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.450
So this knowledge existed in our country since centuries because people had

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:36.110
more meditative temperament. Now this meditative temperament comes because they did not have to fight the Nature so much.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.470
As you know, the climate in India is quite good, people can go outside

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.950
there's no problem of too much heat or uh.. too much uh.. wind -

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.510
it is easy to live outside and that's how people didn't fight much of the Nature.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.750
Because of the fighting with the Nature, the reaction created this

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.410
enthusiasm of the Western people to find out something about the Nature

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:15.210
and that's how we discovered all the Science and all the discoveries which we are enjoying but

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.490
whatever we have discovered so far, is a part of the same.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.450
If you do not discover say, all these instruments, you cannot today talk to people,

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.190
you cannot propagate what is important, you cannot achieve

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:43.450
the Spiritual ascent en-masse, you cannot give it to thousands of people unless and until you have some means to do it.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.890
So, even these discoveries are just complementary to the discoveries about the Self.

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.990
The Kundalini has been described by many people

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.710
but specially, I would mention, Markandeya who lived about 14000 years back.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:10.950
He described this Kundalini, about which I told you yesterday, which resides in the triangular bone

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.670
and I told you that even the Greeks called it a Sacrum bone, meaning a sacred bone.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:22.810
Now the word sacredness, holiness - all these are becoming sort of out of date

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.270
but there's a fact, there is something that is Holy, something that is Sacred.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.990
Now what is this sacredness is, what is this Holiness is, it is rather difficult

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:43.110
for us to know because we deal with matter and matter doesn't talk about these things. At the most, if you go on

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:51.210
with the matter, you go on analysing it one after another and we reach analysis of everything disintegrating

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:56.650
the other parts. Like Medical Science now few

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.330
start studying the human body through Medical Science, which I also studied.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:08.810
You go on analysing it. Ultimately, you reach a point uh.. where you will find a doctor -

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.770
one doctor for one eye another doctor for another eye - there's no synthesis but

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:22.550
when you go to the roots, it is the synthesis of all the uh.. nature, of all the characters of a trade.

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.050
So this is the difference between the approach of one to another.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.490
Now this knowledge was not written down

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:40.770
was told to people, communicated to very few people and that's how it was passed on

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:48.510
from people to people. In the earlier days, they tried only on one or two persons whether they could get realization.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:56.590
At the time of Rama, his father-in-law was the person who was quite deft uh.. in

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:03.270
giving realization but he gave realization to one person called Nachiketa. So you can imagine

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:10.650
that how difficult it was to give realization to one person. First they had to cleanse a person, then

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:18.450
tell him to lead a very austere life, a life of balance - all kinds of things were done and then the Kundalini was

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:23.730
made to rise. That too one by one, every center it used to rise

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:30.990
and then they would see that it was established. For that they had to lead a very secluded life

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:37.590
and it was worked out when the children were about, say, twelve years of age

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:43.210
to about twenty-five years, in complete celibate life.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.750
But now, as the time has come, as I told you, that blossom time has come.

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:56.270
But one must know that those who are sitting here, have gone through it - it is not a new thing that you have come here,

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:01.530
you're already ready for it and that's how you are going to get it. Only in this life time,

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:08.670
in these modern times, we have committed some mistakes because we were cut off from this,

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.710
cut off from the knowledge of the roots and suddenly we became modern

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:20.590
and in this modernism, we started understanding everything through our mental projections.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:25.050
Now mental projection can be very mythical. Supposing, I project My mind

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:31.670
and I say that, ' I am just now sitting in New York, I'm feeling like this and that,' - it's just a mental projection.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:38.690
Whatever we do has to be real but mostly mental projections are mythical

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:45.010
and many people have done that and have been successful in life, so called, they have made lots of money,

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:51.610
they have put their mental projections to this, mental projections to that and said, "This is knowledge, this is knowledge, this is knowledge."

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:57.850
And how are we to make out whether this is true or not? Is there any Absolute method

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.050
by which we can make out whether this is true or not?

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:10.650
The reason is, the Absolute is nowhere to be seen, it's the relative life in which we live.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:16.830
Now the words like Holiness or the words like Sacredness and Auspiciousness,

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.670
have lost their value because we have lost the sense of that knowledge, that sensitivity.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:30.850
As I told you yesterday that I went to Rome and the mayor there just seeing My photograph, just

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:38.830
said, "Oh, this is Divinity!" and he helped us so much but the thing that has acted in him, is that sensitive

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:44.630
temperament which he, they have retained somehow or the other or it existed within him.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:53.350
But we have to understand that every matter has a kind of a

00:09:54.910 --> 00:10:02.310
coefficience by which it can tell you whether it is sacred or not, which is Holy or not.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:10.390
Like in India, we say that this place is Holy. Now how do we say this is a Holy place,

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:17.590
how do we understand this is a Holy place? Because a person who is a realized soul, who

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:24.790
may not be a rich man, he may be a poor man, he might be just a ascetic, he may be a married man but a realized soul

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:30.970
is a category, is a state of mind, if he has, he can feel the

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:37.930
Divine vibrations from that place and can say, "O, this is a Holy place." I'll give you an instance.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:46.270
In Rahuri is a place uh.. uh.. called as Musalwadi and that place they have got a huge, big lake

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:50.570
and that lake was uh.. to be

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.690
put into proper channel so they thought, make a big [UNCLEAR - BUNK OR BUND?]  on it.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:02.350
So they tried to make - an Englishman. It is about 50 - 60 years back an English engineer tried to make a bund there

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:09.190
and at a point he found he could not build anything. The thing that he build used to fall down,

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:15.070
again he used to build something, used to fall down; So he was surprised. Then one

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:22.130
Muslim fakir, as we call them - a realized soul came that way, he said, "Oh, this you leave it, this is a Holy place,

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:27.310
you cannot do anything, you better leave it alone." So they went round that place.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:32.050
Can you imagine a bund going uh.. straight like this and the place is like that!

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:38.150
So when I went to that place they asked Me, "Mother, we would like You to see if it is a Holy place."

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:43.870
I took some of the sahaja yogies who are sitting here and when we went there

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:49.490
we found it was emitting cool breeze from that place. You could feel it, all of us could feel it.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:55.950
Now, it is something, a miracle for people to think that how this can give cool breeze.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:03.870
Now as you know that the Spiritual touch of anything

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:11.890
starts emitting vibrations. There's another example I'll give you when

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:16.830
I went to Kashmir once and we were driving along a road

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:22.650
and I just felt tremendous vibrations coming from somewhere so I asked the driver, I said,

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:28.190
"Is there a temple here or something?" He said, "No, it's all wilderness. I said, "Alright,

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:35.950
uh.. let's go the way the vibrations are coming." So we went to a place of complete wilderness and passed through that and

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:43.790
then we saw some poor people living there, some Muslims so I asked them, "Is there any temple here?" They said, "No, we don't have

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:49.610
but we have a mosque ahead." I said, "What mosque is that?" They said, "This is Hazratbal."

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:55.030
I said, "Hazratbal?" They said, "There's one hair of Mohammad Sahab kept there."

00:12:55.470 --> 00:13:02.330
I caught it about five, seven miles away from there so we went and we saw. I saw it was there

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:07.450
because it was emitting vibrations - of course we couldn't see the hair because hair was kept inside.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.990
Now this is the thing we have been told even in the Bible

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:18.670
that whatever is created by Mother Earth or by the sky, is not to be reproduced and worshipped.

00:13:19.090 --> 00:13:23.970
Now we must think what is created by the Mother Earth? We never think on those lines,

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:30.070
we just accept whatever people give us the interpretation but let us think what is created by the Mother Earth.

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:37.310
This is what are the Holy places created by Mother Earth. Say, for example, Stonehenge that you have here.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:42.210
Perhaps you do not know it's a Holy thing. All these stones have come out of the Mother Earth,

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:47.050
then some stupid people must have taken it out [UNCLEAR - HUNED?] it up put these things but

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:52.170
actually the stones that have come out, are really the stones that have come out of the Mother Earth.

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:59.210
If you go there and see, it has vibrations. Not only that but it is made in the way, same way as this Kundalini is.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:05.850
So you had, on this island, some people who knew the knowledge of the Divine.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:12.130
They definitely knew otherwise how is it they went round and made a circular thing like that

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:19.150
and they even now go, these tourists go and worship them but they don't know what they're doing, they have no idea what they are doing.

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:25.650
As I told you yesterday, like Mohammad Sahab has told you how to do namaz but the Muslims don't know why to do namaz,

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:31.450
what does that mean, what all these things mean, what Allah-ho-Akbar means - they just do it because they're told.

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:39.770
So there's a gap between what we're told and the gap between what it is but there is a coefficience

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:46.590
of Divinity in a thing. Unless and until you become the Spirit, you cannot feel it.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:53.870
Like the magnet can feel the magnetism, in the same way, you have to become that which can feel all those

00:14:54.190 --> 00:15:01.710
beautiful things which we call as the Divine vibrations. Now, the Divine vibration flows within us

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:09.070
when we get our Self-realization. Before that we are cut off from our Spirit.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:17.210
The Spirit resides in our heart and we are, our attention is not enlightened by that Spirit.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:22.030
The Spirit watches us like a witness, it watches us,

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:29.990
sees how we behave, where we go, what we do, everything is just watching - it's a spectator. That's the situation is of God also,

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:38.170
God Almighty is watching the play, is watching the play of His power which we call as the Holy Ghost.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:44.750
Holy Ghost is the power or we can say, is the Mother who, who has created the whole world,

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:51.930
who has created the whole Universe and is showing the play to one spectator that is the God Almighty

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:59.550
and He is watching all that play and when He's watching all that play, He wants to enjoy it -

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:06.190
the moment He doesn't like it He can destroy it. In the same way within ourselves resides

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:12.810
this Spirit which watches us and sees what we are up to, what we do. But the Kundalini,

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:19.890
this one, which is the Holy Ghost, the reflection of the Holy Ghost which resides in the triangular bone, records everything that we do.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:27.270
It's just like a tape-recorder. It records what we do, what have been our hankering, where have we been, what we have been doing.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:34.550
It's a subtler knowledge; For that we have to extend ourselves and understand that at the human level

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:40.670
you can only go into four dimensions at the most but the fourth one is also in the thinking.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:48.350
Three dimensions actually exist for you but the fourth dimension is in your thinking -

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:54.950
you have imagined, you have listened to people, you have been told by people, it has been

00:16:55.250 --> 00:17:01.410
uh..described to you but it is not part and parcel of your being - is just you know as there -

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:07.250
it's something else, is not yourself. Now this fourth dimension you have to achieve.

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:15.210
So to know this fourth dimension there has to be some arrangement within us, if we are created for that.

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:22.470
If we have to become the fourth dimension, there must be some arrangement within us and this is the arrangement we have got of

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:28.490
uh.. our subtle being which remains working

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:35.510
as Parasympathetic Nervous System. Now this Parasympathetic Nervous System is a system within us

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:43.510
which nourishes us, gives us balance, repairs us just like a fountain

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:50.850
of every energy but that too has limited energy. Sympathetic Nervous System we use

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:58.550
when we have any emergencies - as we run fast uh.. we develop a very high speed

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:05.430
and the heart can start pumping very fast but when we relax,

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:11.650
heart comes back to it's own position. That happens through the Parasympathetic Nervous System.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:18.790
Parasympathetic Nervous System also repairs us all the time but it has a limited energy

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:26.450
and that's how diseases are caused because we exhaust our limited energies due to some reason.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:32.730
May be, it may be that we have overused it so much that it is not

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:40.410
to be now fulfilled by the Parasympathetic. All these things happen and we develop diseases of different kinds.

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:48.630
As I told you yesterday we have three powers within us. One of them is the left-hand side power of desire,

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:55.410
the second power is the right-hand side power of action and the central power of our evolution.

00:18:56.430 --> 00:19:03.730
So the left-hand side power is manifested outside in the gross as Left Sympathetic Nervous System

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:10.150
and the right-hand side is manifested within us as the Right Sympathetic Nervous System

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:16.530
and the central one, the Parasympathetic - so in the gross we call them by these names.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:24.050
Now, the evolutionary process has taken place since long - it's not today that the evolution has been going on.

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:29.790
At the matter level the evolution takes place when we have the periodic table

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:37.770
and the Carbon is placed in the center and balancing, it has four valencies, then it becomes higher and higher and higher.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:45.310
At the human stage when we come, we start balancing ourselves like trial and error. First we try this,

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:49.430
"Oh, it's no good, it doesn't help us," so try another. It's like we try

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:54.690
uh.. Capitalism, then Communism, then Capitalism, then Communism - we try all these things.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:20:01.290
It's just we go from one extreme to another extreme, then we try to come to the center

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:09.090
and when we come to the center, that's the time our ascent takes place - it's not going to the left or to the right.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:16.630
Now the left represents our past and the right represents our future so we have to be in the present, at this moment

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:25.310
we have to be there but we cannot be. We can, now for example people might be thinking at this time about the past,

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:30.890
may be about the future, "Whether I'll get the conveyance or not," but at this moment

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:37.550
we cannot stay but when we come to this moment, there is no thought, there is no thought.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:44.490
One thought rises and falls off, another thought rises and falls off. In between the thought there's a little gap

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:52.890
and that gap is the present and that we cannot feel within ourselves because we live in the past or in the future.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:21:00.970
So when this Kundalini rises, what She does, She elongates those thoughts and by that elongation

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:07.490
the gap between the two thoughts elongates, we can say, increases

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:13.470
and we become thoughtlessly aware. But in the movement of the Kundalini,

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:18.410
when  the Kundalini moves, from this state when it rises

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:24.370
first it enters, as you see, into the first chakra of the

00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:30.810
this green chakra, which we can as the Nabhi Chakra.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:39.090
The Nabhi chakra is the one, which we can, the Navel center or the Solar Plexus, in the, in the gross is called as Solar Plexus

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:46.370
which has got ten sub-plexuses, in the same way, this has got ten petals, is said there are ten petals.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:53.630
Now this is a very important center for us because this is the center where we start our evolution.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:22:00.370
As animals we were seeking food, we were seeking protection and that's how we evolved.

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:04.910
Then, now at a human stage this seeking is

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:11.950
manifested as we seek power - people want to become members of Parliament, this, that is all seeking in the power.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:17.830
Then some people want to have money, possessions, this, that - we seek in possessions.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:23.550
Some people think that, "This is my son, my child," - this my, my business goes on

00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:31.450
and they call it love and it's very possessiveness also sometimes and that's also manifests but then they discover

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:39.190
that these things do not give you joy - there's something beyond that must be giving us joy

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:46.150
and when that comes within our awareness then our real evolution starts.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:54.090
That's the point one has to reach. That's a special category of people whom we call as seekers but at this point

00:22:54.830 --> 00:23:02.250
it's a very dangerous thing. I've warned you before also, two years back, I told you that there are people in the market

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:10.290
who are just waiting to catch hold of you because they're all here to just make money, nothing else - it's all money-oriented.

00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:19.070
And when you are seeking they just grab you. They tell you, "Alright, five pounds for this and you get God."

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:23.770
Can you imagine such nonsense they talk and people believe them!

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:29.670
How can you get your evolution by giving money, think of it!

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:38.190
And when I told this they were so angry with Me. I said you cannot do it, you cannot organize it, it's natural process, is your birthright

00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:43.890
to get your realization and nobody can charge you money - it's a ridiculous.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:52.390
You are very intelligent people, you have got sciences and all that but in these matters you don't know anything, you are naive

00:23:52.790 --> 00:24:00.750
to accept these things as that you can pay for God, you can uh.. pay for your evolution, you can pay for your realization.

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:10.450
The same thing here happens to you when you start seeking, then you think we must do something about, we must put in some effort.

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:18.450
As I told you yesterday, with effort you go in the wrong direction - either you move to the left side or to the right side.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:22.910
So when you move to the left side, what happens you get possessed,

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:29.030
you get possessed because on the left side all your Collective Consciousness is there.

00:24:30.170 --> 00:24:37.470
Cancer is caused by possessions - that is the one that triggers. I saw a television show in which

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:44.370
they told Me, the doctors uh.. were telling people that

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:52.370
the vulnerability of the cancer is first established because when sympathetic is too much active,

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:59.330
vulnerable you become but triggering takes place with some proteins called protein 58

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:07.810
and protein 52 - because they give just names - uh.. they attack you and the triggering comes from

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:13.830
the area which is built within us since our creation - means the Collective Subconscious.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:21.710
So unless and until you get possessed by something cancer cannot be triggered though we are vulnerable every moment

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:29.710
because we are so much on the sympathetic - all the time we are in emergency. So this kind of an attack comes to us from

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:35.530
this area which is built within us, known as Collective Consciousness, Subconscious.

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:41.530
Now this Collective Subconscious is existing within us since our creation.

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:49.330
Now, if you start moving too much into, say, bow to someone and submit to someone

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:54.070
and that guru is an expert on all these things, which we call in Sanskrit language,

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:58.730
as Preta Vidya, Shamshan Vidya - is the, uh..is the knowledge of the dead -

00:26:00.150 --> 00:26:07.530
then they can entice you, they can mesmerise you, they can ask you to kill yourself, they can do what they like, they'll say, "Go and destroy yourself."

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:11.070
You have heard of such cases where people have destroyed.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:18.810
But we must use our intelligence to understand that, "Are we to destroy ourselves now?"

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:27.330
Then they are another kind, they will say, "You have to jump like frogs, you have to jump all the time."

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:32.690
Anybody can jump; What is so great? But are we to become frogs or worms?

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:42.810
Then some people going to these things, I mean, TM now, I must tell you openly, I have so many people coming from TM,  suffering from Epilepsy -

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:49.690
absolutely they suffer from Epilepsy, no doubt about it and they have come to Me and the person who was the

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:54.670
director of their uh... academic in

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:59.830
[ASIDE - WHAT WAS THAT PLACE?] [ROANOKE OR RONOCK?]  [ROANOKE OR RONOCK?]  in, in Scotland

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:06.990
he came to Me and he was suffering from Epilepsy, his wife was suffering from Epilepsy, his child was suffering from Epilepsy.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:14.030
The fellow was such a rich man, he was a diamond merchant, he became a bankrupt, he had to go away to South Africa,

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:21.330
the wife is now gone to India, she's so fed up of life. Now of course, she's cured with sahaja yoga and the child is alright.

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:28.090
So they paid thousands of pounds, thousands - six thousand pounds they paid to this man,

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:35.090
to go to Switzerland where they were given food for six days, in such way, that first day only the water

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:42.690
that has boiled some potatoes. Then the second day that same water, third day the same water, fourth day the same water

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:49.210
and the fifth day they were given the rind of the potato with all the filth - imagine what a mockery!

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:55.090
And last day, the potato and six thousand pounds they paid each - is a fact.

00:27:55.790 --> 00:28:03.690
There are so many sitting here, from TM, who have been cured. Now people go just headlong, why?  Because they wanted to fly.

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:11.210
Who has flown? Put their guru on to one of these uh.. Pisa, what you call, the leaning tower of Pisa.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:19.010
Let him fly, let's see, can he fly? He cannot fly but when I tell about them people don't like it because I'm telling you the truth

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:25.870
that understand, you cannot pay for it. Now why you want to fly, I can't understand - are you going to become birds?

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:35.030
All these queer and strange ideas, how can any intelligent man go to but the reason I ask them sometimes

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:42.670
why, why did you? There's a Jew girl, very intelligent, she's very well educated and a barrister and all that

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:50.830
she had big problems. I asked her, "Why, why did you go to TM? What was so great? This was all stupid they did, then why did you go?"

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:55.690
She said, "I was so fed up with the fanaticism of the Jews that I jumped into it."

00:28:56.150 --> 00:29:03.550
Another one says, "I was so fed up with the Catholics that I went there." Another says, "The Christians were so this way, I went there."

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:08.330
This is going 'from fire to frying pan.'

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:14.770
How the brain works I don't understand but it is so

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:22.830
much a common sense to understand, if somebody says that, by saying some words you are going to fly in the air

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:31.030
for that you have to pay some money and you accept it, I must say, that somebody has really enticed you and mesmerised you

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:36.450
otherwise nobody who is saying would accept such an absurd thing - isn't it?

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:44.290
And I was shocked because these are the seekers, again I say, the special category of people who are seeking God.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:52.150
Then another group comes from India, another thugs, I tell you, real thugs, you must know

00:29:52.330 --> 00:30:00.150
that Indians are now trying to attack you in a subtle way, definitely because you attacked them in a very gross way so now they are attacking you.

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:07.210
Same thing happening in America - you go and destroyed them, they're not dead, they're there - they are attacking back Americans.

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:13.590
And that's how you are attacked and you accept these things because, you see, they pamper your ego,

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:18.590
perhaps because they tell you something very intellectual, big things and you accept.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:24.210
Why don't you go and find out what's happening to the people? How many people have gone to the lunatic asylum?

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:30.910
And they have money, they have so much money they can hush up anything. There were one fellow who ran away from India

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:36.790
to America because he, Indians couldn't bear him

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:44.610
and this fellow who ran away to America, you see, a picture was made about them, what was that, it's

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:50.090
'God who ran away' or something like that, that picture was shown here in the BBC.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:58.670
BBC showed it, we have got the tape of that but this fellow has so much money that he purchased that picture from BBC

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:06.510
and now it cannot be shown to the public; I wish we could show you that but in the private, in the drawing-rooms you can see.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:14.670
All these tricks are there, you see, so the money itself begets money,

00:31:15.290 --> 00:31:22.370
also begets all kinds of trickeries. You gave him money, you gave them money and they are playing money on you.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:27.530
One must understand that as far as God is concerned, keep money away.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:33.370
Anybody who asks for money is seeking money - how can he talk of God?

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:42.710
This seeking can take you to the right side also, like these lamas are -

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:48.690
all these people are doing right side jobs, what you call the Supra-conscious jobs, the Collective Supra-conscious.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:53.350
Lamas, you see, you must have known that Hitler took advice from lamas.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:32:01.250
Lamas gave them advice how to capture these spirits who are very aggressive, very ruthless, very

00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:06.750
uh.. very heartless people, emotionless and that's how he managed

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:10.090
to entice these Germans, who are still there.

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:17.650
Even in this country or everywhere you can find this horrible, aggressive uh.. spirits are hovering on people

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:22.470
who try to destroy others. So that work is still on,

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:30.130
that play is still on. Actually, I must say, in the West people have, are so naive - they have no idea about the dead.

00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:39.190
What happens about the dead, they don't know and they play about. For example to have all the dead bodies in the church, is very dangerous for children.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:45.970
Special care must be taken when you take your children to the cemetery -

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:54.430
it's very dangerous. I mean, Indian churches don't have anything like that. No Indian would tolerate a nonsense like that to have

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:59.870
to walk on the graves - imagine! A lady came here to see the cathedral, they took her round,

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:04.070
she's walking like this. I said, "Why?" She said, "You see, all dead are lying here, how to walk on top of them?"

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:13.810
We have no idea as to how this dead acts and all these diseases are so common in this country

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:20.110
or in the West, are because we have not paid any attention to keep out the dead.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:28.330
Now this knowledge was not with you that's why they took advantage of you, they came down here upon you and enticed you.

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:38.130
And this enticement is so subtle that you can make it out. Then, in India we grow all kinds of drugs,

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:45.670
all kinds of drugs. I've never seen any drug all My life nor do I know one person who is an Indian who takes drugs - can you imagine?

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:53.010
But here, the drugs have crawled into - how? Because these people have introduced and the dead -

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:56.570
those dead who want drugs, want you to drink.

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:03.750
Even Alcoholism, if you go maximum to that side, can take you to that kind of enticement.

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:10.930
Alcoholism can be cured by sahaja yoga because is a spirit that is drinking. It's not that you are drinking.

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:17.010
Like, I had a lady from Cuba, a thin, little, petite lady and her husband told Me,

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:24.630
"She can take one bottle of whisky neat." I said, "Annh, she looks such a little thing how can she take one bottle?" "Yes, she does."

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:30.590
So I asked her, I put a, a bandhan, as we call it, on her

00:34:30.970 --> 00:34:37.690
and I saw a huge, big negro coming out of her. I asked her, "Did you know any negro?"

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:42.690
She said, "Mother, did you see him, you see him! This is the one who drinks - everyone blames me."

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:49.950
Really, she said so and now she is a cured woman.

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:56.790
So, all these extremes things if you go - if you go to the extreme of the right - now people are jogging like mad. I mean,

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:00.370
one should not do anything of extremes - little bit is alright,

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:08.530
but going like mad, everybody running fast like, you'll get heart attacks, you must understand. You'll get heart attacks in no time.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:14.850
Wearing tight clothes to that extent - you will get varicose veins, you will develop all these uh..

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:21.270
troubles of your uh.. knees and all that. You must understand you should be normal people, you should

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:29.290
keep yourself in a way that you do everything in a moderate manner, so you keep in the central path of evolution.

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:34.550
But going to the extreme of everything is our style.

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:40.570
We go to extremes as Indians also go to some extremes and you go to another extremes, we can see the uh..

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:47.690
uh..French going to another extremes - everybody is like that; They are towards the extremes but keep a moderate life

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:53.690
and the one who leads a moderate life, is very easy for him to get his ascent.

00:35:54.170 --> 00:36:00.790
Now the same seeking becomes the seeking of God, seeking of beyond, seeking of something higher

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:06.470
and that higher, is the Spirit; You have to become the Spirit

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:11.870
and when you become the Spirit, what happens to you that we have to see.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:19.150
When you become the Spirit, physically you get alright automatically.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:28.230
When you start getting the vibrations, physically you are alright. Leukemia can be cured, cancer can be cured, so many things can be cured -

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:36.130
Why? Because the exhausted energy that is in your centers gets refilled,

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:44.910
you get connected from here to the whole, to the subtler energy which is nourishing, which is permeated into everything,

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:50.350
which is nourishing everything - you get in contact with that; This is the yoga

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:58.010
and all the time that energy is flowing within you. When it is flowing within you, you do not get into tensions.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:04.190
Not only that but this connection makes you an universal being.

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:09.110
You become part and parcel of the whole - you are already but you are not aware.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:17.050
For this finger is aware that it is a part and parcel of the whole but we are not aware that we are part and parcel of the whole.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:25.710
So what happens that we feel, "Oh, we have helped this gentleman, we have helped that gentleman, we have done so much for that person."

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:33.530
Actually whom do you help? You help yourself. If this finger is sick and if this finger rubs it,

00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:40.210
is it helping anyone? In the same way in sahaja yoga, we are not helping anyone, we are helping ourselves

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:48.350
because it just flows to that area which requires help. That's how, but you become collectively conscious

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:54.150
you start feeling where you are lacking that vitality,

00:37:54.370 --> 00:38:01.470
in what center you lack it, on your finger-tips. As I told you, that English language has a beautiful sentence called finger-tips

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:10.010
so on your finger-tips you can feel it what is lacking in another person. Then the compassion flows - you become the compassion.

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:16.890
You don't have to say, "Oh, I'm so compassionate," but you are the compassion but it is the compassion

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:24.330
that starts flowing and when it starts flowing, you're in joy. You don't say, "I do it." You say, "It goes, it comes."

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:31.910
You start talking in a third person. The word 'I' goes away. 'I believe' doesn't exist. Then we say, 'We believe,'

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:38.710
because we are not alone, we are so many. How can we say 'I', who is the 'I'? 'I' is lost in 'We'.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:48.110
The energy flows to another person without any difficulty but inside yourself the peace, the joy that you feel.

00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:55.530
The attention is so enlightened that you pay attention to anyone and the person feels alright.

00:38:56.490 --> 00:39:04.350
You think of anyone you want to know, just put your hands; Like we have someone here from Scotland - he was one of the first few who got realization

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:10.750
and very great intellectual, so he started doubting. He thought, "How can it be sitting down here I can feel something?"

00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:19.310
I said, "Alright, what do you want to know about?" He said, "My father has not telephoned for sometime, I would like to know." I said, "Alright, you put your hands like this and try to find out

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:26.950
how is your father?" You know very gross level it is, so he put his hand and said, "Mother, I am getting a burning here, what does that mean?"

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:33.510
Said, "It means that your father has a, a very bad uh.. throat trouble."

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:40.550
He said, "Really?" I said, "Yes, these are all your father's centers and this center is for the throat."

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:48.210
So he telephoned. 'Very bad bronchitis,' this is the word I used and he telephoned to his house and his mother answered

00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:52.830
and he said, "Where is father?" He said, "He is down with very bad bronchitis."

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:58.430
He was amazed - I said, "Alright, we'll cure him now." We just rubbed this finger quite a lot

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:05.370
and there it was, the phone came after one hour, "Your father is alright, surprisingly, miraculously, I don't know how he got well."

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:15.170
So physically you are alright. Mentally - I have seen many mad people become alright because how you become mad

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:21.350
is that, there is an imbalance, you went on the left side too much, you were pulled back, you've become alright.

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:29.030
Then emotionally you develop a balance. You see, all the time we say, "My, my, this is my sister,"

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:34.890
till we discover that she's a snake in the grass, "She's my sister, she's my,

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:41.670
my wife, she is my father," all those but then you see them in their real

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:47.570
way. For example, maybe your own sister may be a snake in the grass and

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:51.630
maybe your husband may be a gem of a person but how do you know?

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:58.830
How do you know that this person is like that or that? On your vibrations you can see.

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:07.870
Same thing you can ask about these gurus who have come. You ask just a question, "What do you think of this guru?" Now anyone -

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:13.550
if he's a horrible one, you'll get burning over here. Sometimes you get blisters

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:18.290
on your fingers and you're surprised how you got this blisters

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:24.290
but the people who are enticed by them are absolutely gone cases.

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:28.150
Till they are absolutely finished they don't come to sahaja yoga.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:34.430
It's very difficult to convince them that you get out of it, you're enticed because they think

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:41.770
firstly, they're paid for it so they must go through it - it's a human nature. Supposing you have paid a ticket for a drama or a play

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:46.250
and you don't like it but still you have paid for it, you sit down, "Alright, I've paid for it, better go through."

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:53.150
Like that, they want to go through it but those who are insane, how can you talk to them?

00:41:54.770 --> 00:42:01.830
The another thing that happens to your attention is that, your attention becomes very balanced.

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:08.130
All the time our eyes are going to this, to that, to  - our eyes become weak and

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:15.670
we become really confused because every time we see something, we see a reaction comes in. Now I come to this place I see, "Oh, how many holes,"

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:24.010
then I start counting the holes and people are really mad I've seen. They see advertisement, they'll say this advertisement, that adver... if they miss one they'll turn around say, "Oh, I miss that."

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:31.730
It's like that. It's a craze with our attention which goes out all the time like mad and it reacts back

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:38.190
and when it reacts, what happens to us that we become a confusion,

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:44.930
a complicated personality and we do not know what to see, what not to see.

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:52.510
Now when your attention is enlightened, you just become a pure personality - your eyes become pure.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:43:00.510
You just see purity, you can't see impure things. If you see something impure, you feel horrible, don't want to do it.

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:08.650
Like our awareness gets that purity. For example, if you take a dog through a dirty lane,

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:14.510
he'll just walk through, he'll have no problem but human beings will have to close their nose - they may not even go through that.

00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:23.010
But after realization you know what is sin what is not sin and you can walk through the places which are beautiful

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:30.990
but if it is a sinful place, you don't like it, you don't enjoy - priorities change immediately. You become such a virtuous person,

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:38.690
you are surprised at yourself what has happened to me. I have known people who have been, so called, uh..

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:44.790
all kinds of things they call it I don't know what names but all sorts of perverted people, I can say, in general

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:51.450
uh.. they, if they come to sahaja yoga, they become such beautiful husband, such nice wives,

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:58.390
such straightforward people, enjoy their married life, enjoy their children and enjoy each other with purity.

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:04.290
Now our society here in the West - for Me it is now My society because I'm sitting here -

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:12.750
Indian society has it's problems, you have your problems but the society has become so funny that we say that

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:21.070
uh... if you have an Indian in your house, maybe your things might disappear but if you have an Englishman or a Western man in your house, maybe your wife may disappear -

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:28.690
is a dangerous thing and nobody minds it - it's love you see; Any nonsense is love.

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:34.710
You spoil anybody's daughter, anything - it's love. All wrong ideas, you see.

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:42.810
If there's purity, say, everybody is a sister or a brother or a mother - a pure relationship -

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:49.590
the life becomes so much easier. You don't know, sahaja yogies are like that; They travel thousands.

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:55.950
This time they went to Switzerland we had one program there, a seminar, they all lived together, no problem

00:44:56.190 --> 00:45:03.170
otherwise if so many people live there, half of the marriages would have been broken down and so many would have eloped

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:06.350
and come back again to say that we have divorced again.

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:14.250
This madness of divorce has come because our, our ideas have

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:19.490
confused us - we're confused. There is no purity.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:25.290
If a pure person like that even looks at such a person, he becomes pure.

00:45:25.570 --> 00:45:31.690
Like Marie Magdalene when she was blessed was Christ, she became a pure woman.

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:39.590
So the purity has to be brought in the society. If you have to save this society, you have to purify

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:47.550
yourself. Every individual has to purify oneself. Now they say, "This is freedom," - this is license,

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:56.130
this is not freedom. Freedom is where there is purity. Without purity there is no freedom - is abandonment,

00:45:56.690 --> 00:46:03.250
is nonsense and that's how we have felt about our life. Of course, when I'm saying that, please don't feel guilty

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:10.810
because that is another thing can happen to you. It's just I'm saying, just telling you how you purify but don't feel guilty about anything

00:46:11.050 --> 00:46:18.450
because whatever I say, you have to forget about it. When I am giving you realization, don't remember all these points otherwise it will be difficult to give you realization.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:23.570
So that's past, finished, gone case - don't worry on that. Just think that how

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:28.330
we immediately become part and parcel of a pure, beautiful society.

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:34.590
The race that has been described, the race of God, that what William Blake has described

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:40.970
that, "Men of God will become prophets and they'll have powers to make others prophets."

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:46.750
For example, for a saint there is nothing like a temptation; He doesn't do wrong things - why?

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:54.550
He just doesn't do. He doesn't have to tell himself that, "I don't run away with his things," or, "I don't run away with his wife,"

00:46:54.770 --> 00:47:02.090
or, "I don't do this wrong," or, "I don't murder anybody." He doesn't have to remember that these ten commandments are there - he's just there.

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:10.910
He doesn't have to remember - how? Because he's gone above them. These ten commandments are in these chakras.

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:17.410
In this chakra are these ten commandments that we have to keep a balance - don't do this, don't do that.

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:24.930
That was alright at the time of Moses - if you say these days," Don't do," you'll have it, so best thing is to raise your Kundalini.

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:31.470
Once you become the Spirit, you become your own master - you start guiding yourself, you know what is wrong, you don't just like it.

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:35.250
I don't have to tell you, you just don't like it - you become a different personality.

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:45.990
Like, I told you, a dog becomes a human being, he doesn't like a dirty lane and when a human become, a human being becomes a saint

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:53.030
he doesn't like it, he doesn't like. But it doesn't mean that you run away to Himalaya, you run away from here - nothing.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:47:57.570
You lead absolutely a normal life but you are a detached person

00:47:58.370 --> 00:48:04.890
and that's how you enjoy the most. For example, see this carpet is beautiful - it's not Mine, I don't possess it. Thank God!

00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:11.570
I can enjoy it better than the person who possesses because he might, the one who possesses it might be thinking, "Might be dirtied

00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:17.070
don't know, Mother is sitting there, God knows what's going to happen to the carpet. I may have to take it for dry-cleaning,"

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:21.110
or some sort of a problem will be in his mind but for Me, nothing - I'm just enjoying.

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:30.350
So this idea of possession is a myth, we do not possess anything. It's a myth created by human-beings, you see.

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:37.470
They have a registration office where they put it. This is, belongs to this person but can we carry it with us when we die?

00:48:40.450 --> 00:48:46.930
It's all outside and that's how we understand and then we understand something very, very beautiful about matter

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:54.830
that the matter is for giving others, matter is to express our feelings to others.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:49:02.450
And you become generosity and generosity has it's own blessings.

00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:10.690
I enjoy My generosity very much but sometimes, you know, I feel generosity give a problem to Me

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:16.970
because I open one door to give and ten doors are open to give Me and I don't know where to keep them, you see, it's very difficult.

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:22.770
Now we had a big house, now My husband is saying, "You better have another big house." I said, "Why?"

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:30.050
He said, "These things what to do? Everyday, You see,  You're having from ten doors while You're giving from one door." Now if I give from ten doors, there will be twenty doors open.

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:39.370
Generosity fills you completely; You're not at all in need of anything. You try that - open your heart.

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:46.950
You have to open your heart. People don't open their heart, they're so frightened, they'll open a chink and see who's there, "Oh, I see."

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:55.530
It maybe raining, it maybe a snowy day, a lady might be standing with a perambulator and a child will be inside that

00:49:55.750 --> 00:50:01.590
but she'll be afraid to see from a chink. Who's going to invade you, who can destroy you?

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:09.570
Who can destroy your spirit? Just enjoy your generosity. See how you will have everything.

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:15.630
I'll give you a very small example of this in My own lifetime. I've been like this all My life

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:20.730
and My husband had problems and My family had problems because of this.

00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:28.210
One day I was just sitting outside and knitting something when I saw a lady coming down with two other men

00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:33.650
and she said, "We are refugees from Punjab, we have no place to live in." And I had a huge house because

00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:40.630
My father was Member of the Parliament and he had a huge house of his own so, I said, "Alright, there's a room here you come along and settle down."

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:46.750
Well I didn't ask who they were, what they were doing, I said it's an outside room let them stay there. They stayed.

00:50:47.770 --> 00:50:54.990
Then My brother came in - you see, he's now, he's now a minister, you see, a very careful man and My husband came in and My brother

00:50:55.430 --> 00:51:00.430
screwed into his brain that, "This is wrong, we don't know these may be thieves, these may be this and

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:04.830
My sister always does like that, I don't know what's going to happen to us and all."

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:09.970
I said, "Whatever they are, they are My responsibility, now you're not going to drive them out at any cost."

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:16.790
At that time a war started and people came to kill and one of them was a Muslim so he, the people came

00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:23.290
in our house and they said, "We have heard there's a Muslim staying in your house." I said, "See this, I am a Christian but I put on this."

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:31.310
I said, "See this is a mark, now, do you believe Me or not." I said, "You better get out from here," and they went away and this the fellow was saved, you see.

00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:36.170
Now, he was a very great poet. I went to Bombay long, long

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:40.610
uh.. years later, I should say, about twelve or fourteen years later

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:49.110
and we were making a little film about something and I was dealing with it so I said, "I know this lady

00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:56.130
uh.. but I won't come there to ask her because she was a great film actress." I said, "I will not ask her because she'll have no choice."

00:51:56.690 --> 00:52:00.650
They said, "But You must say something about." I said, "No, nothing doing, I'm not coming, you go and ask her."

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:05.490
So they went and asked her. She said, "No, no, no, no I cannot join, I must have so much money

00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:10.550
and you cannot have me for nothing at all and this I don't believe in all these charities, this, that,"

00:52:12.070 --> 00:52:20.130
so I kept quiet, didn't say anything but for the opening of the film I went and she was there, she looked at Me and tears started rolling her eyes, just came and embraced Me.

00:52:21.130 --> 00:52:28.730
She said, "I didn't know You were with this." I said, "I know you didn't know, " but she said, "Forgive me, I'll give money, I'll give everything.

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:34.390
This is the lady who saved me long time back," and everybody was amazed

00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:40.510
how this lady who was so materialistic and so particular about her payment has suddenly melted away.

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:48.690
She said, "Oh God, now I learnt, I'd forgotten, I'fd forgotten what it means to be generous," and she was completely changed after that.

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:56.630
So all these things are the quality of the Spirit which is not afraid of anyone - why should you be afraid of anyone

00:52:57.070 --> 00:53:04.650
if you are one with God? Look at Christ, he had nothing to do with the prostitute but when people started hitting her with the stone

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:11.770
He came up and He said, "Now among you, who has not committed any sin, can throw a stone at Me."

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:18.890
Imagine the courage! The courage comes from the Spirit. Because He was Spirit, so He could say such a thing.

00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:26.510
He was not a man compromising with His values, "Alright, if you want we can have discotheque in the church,"

00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:37.150
or we can start a pub; Nowadays they are selling it for pubs. "Let us compromise."

00:53:38.250 --> 00:53:45.950
Truth cannot compromise - it does not. Compassion is different from compromising.

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:54.390
It cannot compromise - truth stands on it's own legs. So that's what happened when Christ said that

00:53:54.910 --> 00:54:00.890
and that happens to you, you become a strong person. You become a person who's strong

00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:08.710
but does not try to oppress other. You do not try to destroy others, you do not want to hate anyone

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:16.930
but what you do is, to stand up on your own, to stand up for the rights of other, to stand up for something great.

00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:24.910
Like we will say Abraham Lincoln, a person like him - Abraham Lincoln was a realized soul - and how he fought for the rights,

00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:30.210
how he talked about democracy. Today let's compromise this, let's compromise that.

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:36.010
Even if somebody is a Hitler - doesn't matter, as long as he is with us, alright, accept him.

00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:46.190
To have that strength you have to be the Spirit - so you become a very, strong, compassionate person.

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:52.130
Only a person who is strong can be compassionate. How can a weakling be a compassionate person - tell Me?

00:54:52.870 --> 00:54:58.990
A tree, which is strong, can only give shelter to people or do you think a falling tree can

00:54:59.230 --> 00:55:02.190
shelter the people - on the contrary it will fall on the people.

00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:08.330
Our ideas are very, very confused about compassion

00:55:08.690 --> 00:55:13.630
and when you become such a strong person, you see the truth before you,

00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:21.210
you know the truth and you are no more afraid of anyone and God looks after you, the best part of it.

00:55:21.590 --> 00:55:27.130
You just don't worry - God looks after you in every inch of the world.

00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:34.810
Every inch of the world - in material way, in your emotional way,

00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:43.250
in your physical way - every way you feel surrounded by His love and His guidance

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:49.350
and His help. He does in such a way - I'll give you a very recent example of sahaja yogies.

00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:56.270
They wanted to go to a place, a very beautiful uh...

00:55:58.090 --> 00:56:03.690
hill, mountain peak, which is known as Zelmet, in uh...

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:08.110
Switzerland and it's a very expensive place to go to

00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:15.430
because I told them something about that - it looks like a one of the deities and all that - they were wanting to go and have a seminar there.

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:19.450
It's a very expensive place and we cannot pay for that,

00:56:19.710 --> 00:56:24.410
they thought that it will be very difficult because uh.. they are not so well off.

00:56:26.370 --> 00:56:33.810
So I said, "Alright, you go and find out." So the people went down to find out and there is a huge, big hotel like place

00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:38.610
and, "Oh," they said, "When do you want to come?"  So they said such and such date.

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:46.030
"Oh, for that date!" they just ran, "Oh, very good, very good. If you want to come for those dates - we somehow or the other cannot fill those dates

00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:51.810
so we are very happy." And they were charging 70

00:56:53.230 --> 00:57:00.290
francs per night and for three days now they're charging us  - how much - 33 francs, for three days -

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:06.490
means about eleven pounds or twelve pounds - can you imagine?

00:57:07.050 --> 00:57:13.450
And now all of them can go and see. This is just a miracle and so many miracles take place like that.

00:57:13.810 --> 00:57:21.350
Even the poster they have put here - you have seen a big poster uh.. in Brighton - now we can't afford because we don't take any money, we

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:26.230
whatever little money they have, they collect and put things. They were finding it impossible

00:57:26.450 --> 00:57:32.430
to advertise. We cannot compete with these false people on two things. Firstly, we cannot advertise

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:36.630
the way they can because they have money and secondly, we cannot go on telling lies the way they do.

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:44.630
They can tell any lies, they'll say that, "We, we will create a new world for you and there will be all gold for you, " and all those because they're liars.

00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:51.370
We are our limitations, we cannot tell you lies. So these uh.. advertising thing also

00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:57.490
was impossible for us to do it but they did it for a song, just for a song.
