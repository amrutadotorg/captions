00:00:08.617 --> 00:00:14.922
You have to do exactly what will
please Me, and not what will please you.

00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:18.906
So you must change your
attention from pleasing all the public.

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:23.195
Some people say, “Those who come
first time, Mother, we must not say this”.

00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:27.382
You must! Certain things you must say to them.

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:36.974
Otherwise, you will make Me
a-prasanna; that will cause problems!

00:00:37.054 --> 00:00:40.968
But when you say to others, you need
not go like Puna and Bombay people

00:00:41.048 --> 00:00:46.697
in their special Marathi language,
but say it in a proper Urdu style,

00:00:46.777 --> 00:00:50.887
that people don’t feel bad, but you must say it!

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:53.781
You should not put those people on My head;

00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:58.086
instead of that, you should tell them
in such a way that people are all right.

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:05.769
So to go deeper into you, you must do also
individual meditation and samuhik (collective).

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:09.133
I would not say all the Sahaja
Yogis in Delhi are like that,

00:01:09.213 --> 00:01:13.437
but… we are very good at organizing,

00:01:13.517 --> 00:01:18.830
which our Bombay Sahaja Yogis and
these Puna Sahaja Yogis must learn.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.285
They quarrel among themselves and I really get fed up.

00:01:22.365 --> 00:01:26.386
And they treat each other shabbily, that I don’t like.

00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:30.557
But individually they are all right,
so they become individualistic.

00:01:30.637 --> 00:01:38.792
Some people become individualistic and
some people become publicist, publicist,

00:01:38.872 --> 00:01:41.906
you see, they’ll please the
public, now they are two extremes.

00:01:41.986 --> 00:01:48.714
What should a Sahaja Yogi do?
They have to become Mother addicts.

00:01:48.794 --> 00:01:53.048
They should do what your Mother likes.

00:01:54.117 --> 00:02:00.035
Do you understand? Need not please
the public or need not please the individual,

00:02:00.115 --> 00:02:03.892
but do what your Mother will
like. That’s a very simple thing

00:02:03.972 --> 00:02:09.485
which Adi Shankaracharya has told
you, that just keep the Mother pleased.

00:02:09.565 --> 00:02:12.093
But nobody makes that study.

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:15.998
Try to make the study, “What makes Mother pleased?”

00:02:16.078 --> 00:02:25.140
Then you will see, I’m very easily
pleased, you see, as a Shiva tattwa.

00:02:25.836 --> 00:02:30.964
Even if you make mistakes,
thrice you pull your ears, it's all right.

00:02:33.193 --> 00:02:37.107
But don't go too far with it.

00:02:37.187 --> 00:02:40.746
You see, the mistakes you commit is all right,

00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:45.025
but don’t take it for granted that
you can go on committing mistakes.

00:02:45.105 --> 00:02:49.862
Because you really get a big rope, but
you will hang yourself ultimately, isn’t it?

00:02:49.942 --> 00:02:52.947
So be afraid of the rope also which is given to you,

00:02:53.027 --> 00:02:55.956
it will hang you much better, otherwise.

00:02:56.036 --> 00:03:00.818
So one has to understand that you
should not be addicted to public opinion

00:03:00.898 --> 00:03:05.497
or to the opinion of your own. Both things are wrong.

00:03:05.577 --> 00:03:10.679
You must behave in such a manner that
it should please all the deities within Me.

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:15.892
As far as I am concerned, I
don't exist, I have no existence.

00:03:15.972 --> 00:03:21.132
Really, believe Me, I have no existence at all, I just...

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.924
It's an assemblage of so many existences, you can say.

00:03:27.004 --> 00:03:31.068
Otherwise, I don’t exist, I don’t find
Myself anywhere in this body, anywhere;

00:03:31.148 --> 00:03:33.529
I don’t find Myself anywhere in the universe.

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:40.533
I’m nowhere, I sometimes find, “What is
all this? Is not Mine, is all foreign to Me.”

00:03:40.613 --> 00:03:49.810
But still, I permeate into it, enjoy it, live with it,

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.253
but I’m not in it, nowhere.

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:59.452
So if you just try to understand
what pleases your Mother,

00:03:59.532 --> 00:04:03.651
you will develop your dignity
because I want you to be dignified;

00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:07.576
it will develop your joy because I want you to be joyous;

00:04:07.656 --> 00:04:18.260
it will give you more capacity to
achieve more vibrations within yourself

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.757
because that is what I’m giving.

00:04:21.837 --> 00:04:27.058
Whatever is good for you, if
you do that, it will please Me.

00:04:27.138 --> 00:04:31.645
For whatever methods are there, by
which one should not positively displease,

00:04:31.725 --> 00:04:34.863
that’s the only thing is. You don’t do anything special,

00:04:34.943 --> 00:04:38.625
but don’t do something extraordinary just to displease.

00:04:38.705 --> 00:04:42.743
If you understand this simple
thing, that don’t try to do anything

00:04:42.823 --> 00:04:47.814
that will displease, you please Me, It is so simple.

00:04:47.894 --> 00:04:54.430
You don’t have to do anything extra, just try to be

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:00.694
loving, affectionate, dignified,
and I’ll be very happy with all that.

00:05:05.628 --> 00:05:11.256
Now, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

00:05:11.336 --> 00:05:14.507
the basic thing is Kundalini.

00:05:14.587 --> 00:05:20.674
And the Kundalini, as I have
told you, is the pure desire.

00:05:20.754 --> 00:05:25.548
Again, listen to it carefully: pure desire.

00:05:25.628 --> 00:05:29.006
That means all other desires are impure.

00:05:29.086 --> 00:05:34.382
There's only one pure desire.
And that is to be one with the Divine.

00:05:34.462 --> 00:05:40.465
One with the Brahma, one with
God — that's the only pure desire.

00:05:40.545 --> 00:05:44.173
All other desires are impure.

00:05:44.253 --> 00:05:49.048
So train your mind gradually

00:05:49.128 --> 00:05:53.253
to achieve that desire as the main thing.

00:05:54.128 --> 00:05:57.674
If you train your mind in that fashion,

00:05:57.754 --> 00:06:01.048
then you can develop pure desire,

00:06:01.128 --> 00:06:06.674
so all other desires will negate, gradually.

00:06:06.754 --> 00:06:08.215
All right.

00:06:08.295 --> 00:06:14.211
Now, this desire to be one with the Divine

00:06:15.253 --> 00:06:18.674
is the purest and the highest.

00:06:18.754 --> 00:06:22.256
And to achieve that

00:06:22.336 --> 00:06:25.336
what have you to do?

00:06:26.712 --> 00:06:31.215
To achieve that you have to keep your Mother pleased.

00:06:31.295 --> 00:06:34.256
Very simple.

00:06:34.336 --> 00:06:37.548
Adi Shankaracharya has said
that you don't bother about it,

00:06:37.628 --> 00:06:40.006
just keep your Mother pleased.

00:06:40.086 --> 00:06:42.215
You have to be a simple person,

00:06:42.295 --> 00:06:45.048
not try to be cunning with Me or clever with Me,

00:06:45.128 --> 00:06:47.507
I know everyone very well.

00:06:47.587 --> 00:06:51.674
Try to tell yourself that "I should say things,

00:06:51.754 --> 00:06:56.507
I should behave in a manner that will please my Mother."

00:06:56.587 --> 00:07:00.340
Supposing you are in Sahaja
Yoga and you are doing wrong things.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.503
It is not going to please Me at all.

00:07:04.378 --> 00:07:08.765
So how to please Mother — that
you should try to see for yourself,

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:14.215
what kind of a thing pleases Me the best.

00:07:14.295 --> 00:07:16.389
I am also a very simple person.

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:19.992
So I want a simple-hearted person who is simple about it.

00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:23.863
But this Lakshmi Tattwa has to become Mahalakshmi Tattwa.

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.696
That is for your ascent.

00:07:25.776 --> 00:07:29.696
And just to get it to that Mahalakshmi Tattwa

00:07:29.776 --> 00:07:34.155
what you have to do is to use all your material things

00:07:34.235 --> 00:07:38.239
and your material being in such a way that you please Me.

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:40.239
That is very important.

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:43.947
So you should not do something that will not please Me.

00:07:44.027 --> 00:07:47.863
That's very important, everybody must understand.

00:07:47.943 --> 00:07:52.981
I want you to understand that when you dress up, also,

00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:58.228
certain things I don't like, at
all, like disheveled hair… At all.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.380
She can be achieved through bhakti.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.120
She can only be achieved through dedication.

00:08:09.065 --> 00:08:12.498
She’s only fond of her bhaktas, the devotees.

00:08:12.578 --> 00:08:15.885
For this, meditation is the only way I should say.

00:08:15.965 --> 00:08:19.360
Emotionally you may feel closer to me in your heart.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.473
But through meditation, surrender.

00:08:22.553 --> 00:08:27.013
Meditation is nothing but
surrendering, is complete surrendering.

00:08:27.093 --> 00:08:31.772
In your full freedom, complete
freedom, you have to surrender.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.160
And only through your bhakti,
through your devotion and dedication,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.776
you can achieve me.

00:08:37.856 --> 00:08:41.876
My achievement is the complete
manifestation of your Divine powers.

00:08:45.107 --> 00:08:49.784
It’s very simple, made so simple.

00:08:49.864 --> 00:08:52.880
I’m only pleased by people who are simple,

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.226
innocent, who are not tricky,

00:08:55.306 --> 00:08:58.397
who are loving, affectionate to each other.

00:08:58.477 --> 00:09:00.653
It’s very easy to please me.

00:09:00.733 --> 00:09:03.293
When I see you loving each other,

00:09:03.373 --> 00:09:07.759
talking good of each other, helping
each other, respecting each other,

00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:12.287
laughing aloud together, enjoying
together each other’s company,

00:09:12.367 --> 00:09:15.386
I get my blessing, my first joy.

00:09:16.393 --> 00:09:19.460
So, the dedication in meditation,

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:23.400
complete dedication in meditation, must be practiced.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:28.727
It’s not for your good now
you are doing it, so-called ‘your’.

00:09:28.911 --> 00:09:32.379
So, how to please Mother?

00:09:32.459 --> 00:09:35.033
I am also a simple person

00:09:35.113 --> 00:09:38.513
so I want a simple-hearted person.

00:09:43.753 --> 00:09:47.406
So, this Heart Chakra is to be first looked after.

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:51.286
That with your heart - desire,
you will keep your Mother pleased.

00:09:55.555 --> 00:09:57.962
First of all, your heart must be clear.

00:09:58.042 --> 00:09:59.772
If the heart is not clear,

00:09:59.852 --> 00:10:04.334
then everything has no meaning
because it is a “dark heart”

00:10:04.415 --> 00:10:06.579
which is doing all these things.

00:10:06.659 --> 00:10:10.558
The heart has to be clean, absolutely surrendered

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:14.473
and must try to put me before everything else.

00:10:14.553 --> 00:10:18.846
The Lakshmi tattva has to become Mahalakshmi tattva.

00:10:18.926 --> 00:10:21.938
That is for your ascent.

00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:26.567
And just to get into the Mahalakshmi tattva

00:10:26.647 --> 00:10:30.807
what you have to do is to use all your material things

00:10:30.887 --> 00:10:33.726
and your material being in such a way

00:10:33.806 --> 00:10:35.560
that you please me.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:41.207
You have to keep your Mother
pleased by pleasing other Sahaja Yogis

00:10:41.287 --> 00:10:44.034
and not other people.

00:10:44.114 --> 00:10:48.795
What guru dakshinat have you given me?

00:10:48.875 --> 00:10:54.141
Understand that your money is not worth the dust

00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:58.341
on the feet of your Mother Guru.

00:10:58.421 --> 00:11:00.761
You should give your hearts,

00:11:00.841 --> 00:11:04.561
only clean and holy hearts.

00:11:04.641 --> 00:11:07.421
You must clean your physical beings.

00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:10.442
You must get up early in the morning

00:11:10.522 --> 00:11:14.166
and spend at least one hour
on meditation and worshipping.

00:11:14.246 --> 00:11:17.787
Perform "Aarti" and meditation in the evening.

00:11:22.015 --> 00:11:27.295
But the matured people are those who surrender,

00:11:27.375 --> 00:11:30.735
who bow to the Mother Earth.

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:35.975
So the capacity to bow is the best judgment of yourself;

00:11:36.055 --> 00:11:39.215
and leaving everything,

00:11:39.295 --> 00:11:45.495
to the power of gravity of Your Mother

00:11:45.575 --> 00:11:47.775
to do every work for you;

00:11:47.855 --> 00:11:53.815
and leaving all your small little worries behind.

00:11:53.895 --> 00:12:05.295
You have to rise above, these restricting powers.

00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:11.935
And achieve the completion of this Virata Shakti,

00:12:12.015 --> 00:12:15.055
which ultimately becomes a madhura Shakti,

00:12:15.135 --> 00:12:18.575
madhura. There's no word in English language

00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:21.495
but it means a sweet power.

00:12:21.575 --> 00:12:25.095
Like the fruit becomes sweet,

00:12:25.175 --> 00:12:28.935
that's how you all have to become very sweet.

00:12:29.015 --> 00:12:33.215
Krishna tried to make everything very sweet in the sense

00:12:33.295 --> 00:12:35.615
it was all madhura shakti that was acting,

00:12:35.695 --> 00:12:39.055
all His play, all His dancing,

00:12:39.135 --> 00:12:41.256
all His stories if you read

00:12:41.336 --> 00:12:44.375
is nothing but madhura shakti

00:12:44.455 --> 00:12:46.735
- towards gopas and gopis,

00:12:46.815 --> 00:12:48.535
towards other Sahaja Yogis.

00:12:48.615 --> 00:12:50.575
So you have to keep your Mother pleased

00:12:50.655 --> 00:12:53.695
by pleasing all other Sahaja Yogis,

00:12:53.775 --> 00:12:58.051
and not other people, they are not important.

00:13:01.818 --> 00:13:06.695
So also I convince you that what I say, what I do,

00:13:06.775 --> 00:13:10.041
you know that, that I look after you.

00:13:10.121 --> 00:13:14.951
But when you take up responsibility
upon yourself and start thinking about it,

00:13:15.031 --> 00:13:20.996
then I cannot help. So just know that, leave it to God.

00:13:21.076 --> 00:13:24.017
It’s all for your good, for your ‘hita’.

00:13:24.097 --> 00:13:26.542
Everything is for your ‘hita’, whatever it is.

00:13:26.622 --> 00:13:31.102
Sometimes I have to shout at you,
sometimes I have to correct you,

00:13:31.182 --> 00:13:33.798
sometimes I have to tell you that, “Don’t come here.”

00:13:33.878 --> 00:13:37.928
Some people who touch me, you
see, can give me horrible sensations.

00:13:38.008 --> 00:13:43.218
Then I say, “You just don’t come here. You don’t
stand before me, you get out from here.” That helps them.

00:13:43.298 --> 00:13:45.682
But if they stand there, the bhoots will never leave

00:13:45.762 --> 00:13:49.503
because the bhoots want to trouble me.

00:13:51.134 --> 00:13:54.295
So this point if you understand,
you will get completely detached

00:13:54.375 --> 00:13:58.188
and we’ll know that for our good, for our betterment

00:13:58.268 --> 00:14:03.241
we must keep Mother pleased and
these things if we do, by displeasing Her,

00:14:03.321 --> 00:14:06.164
we are going to be finished.

00:14:06.244 --> 00:14:11.146
Now to understand this, what
you need – not age, not position,

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:19.708
not your qualifications, nothing – you
need a wise mind, deep personality.

00:14:23.537 --> 00:14:31.546
Then the second thing you said that you
are facing: your Sahasrara was on the thing.

00:14:31.626 --> 00:14:33.987
Yes, one of the reasons for nirvichara is that.

00:14:34.067 --> 00:14:39.167
But also nirvichara is a way to
express the blessings of your Mother.

00:14:39.247 --> 00:14:42.706
When She wants to bless you. See,
you wrote the letter [so] She was happy.

00:14:42.786 --> 00:14:45.330
Just to bless you, you became nirvichar.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:51.085
You see, it’s the blessing. That’s how you…that’s
the grace that comes to you from your Mother,

00:14:51.165 --> 00:14:54.439
that you become nirvichar – that one has to recognise.

00:14:54.519 --> 00:14:58.206
If you do the things that I tell
you, I feel I bless you very much,

00:14:58.286 --> 00:15:02.305
because they are for your good, for your kalyana
(benevolence), for your mangal (auspiciousness)

00:15:02.385 --> 00:15:06.398
and that’s why you are blessed and
that blessing you feel as nirvichara.

00:15:06.478 --> 00:15:08.645
Because I am Nirvichara myself.

00:15:12.807 --> 00:15:15.941
Sahaja yoga cannot workout without Shri Ganesha.

00:15:16.021 --> 00:15:19.416
He is the one who is Sahaja.

00:15:19.496 --> 00:15:24.333
He is the one who creates all spontaneity of the world.

00:15:24.413 --> 00:15:27.208
He is the one who takes you to the right path.

00:15:27.288 --> 00:15:30.917
He is the one who gives you everything easily.

00:15:30.997 --> 00:15:34.039
He is the one who creates all the chamatkars,

00:15:34.119 --> 00:15:41.911
all the magic, all the miracles of the world.

00:15:44.368 --> 00:15:50.708
He is the Ganapati. He is the
one who is sitting on Ganas,

00:15:50.788 --> 00:15:58.454
in the sense that He is like the king of all the Ganas.

00:16:00.409 --> 00:16:05.708
The one who has pleased Shri Ganesha
has pleased all the Gods and Goddesses

00:16:05.788 --> 00:16:12.499
because all the Gods and Goddesses are
pleasing Shri Ganesha, so what is the need?

00:16:12.579 --> 00:16:14.917
And Shri Ganesha is very clever.

00:16:14.997 --> 00:16:16.583
He knows,

00:16:16.663 --> 00:16:26.371
please His Mother is the only simple thing He has to do.

00:16:27.247 --> 00:16:30.397
To have all the powers of the world,

00:16:30.477 --> 00:16:33.683
just keep the Mother pleased.

00:16:33.763 --> 00:16:35.363
May God bless you.
