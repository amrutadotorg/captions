Shri Ganesha Gauri Puja

00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:20.843
Sydney, Australia

00:00:21.044 --> 00:00:24.837
April 4, 1981

00:06:11.049 --> 00:06:15.281
Today is a very unique thing that is happened,

00:06:15.482 --> 00:06:22.324
is a special luck for Sahaja yogis of Australia.

00:06:23.501 --> 00:06:26.212
This day has never been celebrated before

00:06:26.413 --> 00:06:28.968
in the history of Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.374
Today is the New Year’s Day for Sahaja yogis,

00:06:33.575 --> 00:06:40.849
because this is the New Year’s Day

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.852
of the Shalivahan calendar.

00:06:44.053 --> 00:06:48.345
As you know, Shalivahan is My dynasty,

00:06:48.546 --> 00:06:50.870
and they are called as Shalivahan

00:06:51.071 --> 00:06:53.700
because they are the carriers of the shawls of the Goddess,

00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:56.826
they are called as the, because as you are also carrying

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.799
so many times My shawls around.

00:07:01.301 --> 00:07:03.305
And they were called as Shalivahan.

00:07:03.506 --> 00:07:12.221
So this New Year’s Day is the first day of advent of Goddess,

00:07:12.422 --> 00:07:15.426
the nine days there are.

00:07:15.859 --> 00:07:23.916
Then in another times that there are Satya Yug,

00:07:24.117 --> 00:07:29.232
then there’s Dvapara, Treta, Kali Yuga: there are four yugas.

00:07:29.433 --> 00:07:33.894
So in two yugas the Goddess incarnated,

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.248
one before the Satya Yuga and one after it.

00:07:38.988 --> 00:07:45.177
So today is the day to mark absolutely the first day

00:07:45.378 --> 00:07:49.698
when She incarnated on this Earth.

00:07:50.357 --> 00:07:53.950
That’s the day also of the Gauri,

00:07:54.151 --> 00:07:58.971
because Virgin is the first form of the Goddess.

00:08:00.103 --> 00:08:13.625
And She created also Ganesha on Tuesday,

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:17.021
just starting this week.

00:08:17.591 --> 00:08:19.825
What is the day? The day today is …?

00:08:20.026 --> 00:08:21.280
[Today’s the fourth.]

00:08:21.481 --> 00:08:22.481
Today ….

00:08:22.682 --> 00:08:25.123
[Saturday, Mother.]

00:08:25.894 --> 00:08:27.842
[Saturday.]

00:08:28.043 --> 00:08:32.071
Saturday. Now, now, it’s over. Now don’t stay, all right?

00:08:32.272 --> 00:08:34.477
While I’m speaking you should not take My photographs.

00:08:34.678 --> 00:08:37.389
It’s a very wrong idea, because it disturbs Me.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:40.357
Moreover, you see, when the speaking, while I’m speaking

00:08:40.558 --> 00:08:41.692
and when you take My photograph

00:08:41.893 --> 00:08:44.556
sometimes I’ve seen they come out very odd.

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:46.922
Best take photographs when I’m not speaking, you see,

00:08:47.123 --> 00:08:50.598
because all the time the sound is coming, everybody is distracted

00:08:50.799 --> 00:08:52.911
and the attention doesn’t fix, you see.

00:08:53.112 --> 00:08:55.347
Is a very important thing I’m talking, all right?

00:08:55.548 --> 00:08:58.558
Now don’t take any photographs, please.

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:01.915
Pay attention to what I’m saying.

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:05.216
[Hindi]

00:09:13.797 --> 00:09:19.681
So Tuesday is the day when Ganesha was established,

00:09:19.882 --> 00:09:26.356
and then the Goddess started working.

00:09:26.557 --> 00:09:32.494
The first one, the one day when She started is, was the Wednesday.

00:09:32.695 --> 00:09:35.339
She started working out on Wednesday.

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:38.418
Wednesday is the action day,

00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:41.209
that’s why she started on Wednesday.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:45.586
Today is, under the circumstances it is Saturday;

00:09:45.787 --> 00:09:50.154
but I’m telling you about the original timings.

00:09:52.579 --> 00:09:56.966
Because Wednesday is the day of the Swadisthana,

00:09:57.167 --> 00:10:01.690
that’s the day She started working it out, the whole thing.

00:10:01.999 --> 00:10:06.295
So first, Tuesday is the first day in Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:06.496 --> 00:10:09.088
Wednesday is the second day.

00:10:09.289 --> 00:10:14.021
And you’ll be surprised that the stars are also the same,

00:10:14.222 --> 00:10:18.673
because Tuesday is the day of the Mars

00:10:18.874 --> 00:10:23.491
which is resided by Shri Ganesh.

00:10:23.692 --> 00:10:30.757
Wednesday is the day of Mercury, and Mercury is the Swadisthana.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:41.769
Third day – yes – third day is the day of Jupiter:

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.259
what you call, we call it guru, is the day of the guru,

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:48.975
is the Jupiter, is the teacher.

00:10:51.288 --> 00:10:54.377
Now, Friday is the day of the Goddess.

00:10:54.578 --> 00:10:57.916
Now see the chakras also, of the Goddess,

00:10:58.117 --> 00:11:01.205
Mother of the Earth, Mother of the Universe,

00:11:01.406 --> 00:11:03.648
Venus.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:09.213
But in Indian Sanskrit language the names of the days

00:11:09.414 --> 00:11:14.679
are exactly the same, tallying with the stars,

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:22.815
Then Saturday is the day of Shri Krishna, Shani, is Saturn.

00:11:26.777 --> 00:11:31.308
Then Sunday is the day of Christ, the Sun.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:37.965
Monday is the day of Sadashiva,

00:11:38.166 --> 00:11:41.767
is of realization, of integration.

00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:47.135
These are the seven days when God created the whole universe.

00:11:50.114 --> 00:11:52.570
That’s what I told yesterday, that in this narrow way

00:11:52.771 --> 00:11:54.977
you cannot understand Christianity.

00:11:55.178 --> 00:11:58.990
You’ll think it’s all mad, which is not.

00:11:59.191 --> 00:12:02.030
Only when you read other things, other scriptures,

00:12:02.231 --> 00:12:06.426
then only you will understand what Christ said.

00:12:06.861 --> 00:12:11.707
So today is the day of – first day –

00:12:11.908 --> 00:12:14.366
of when Ganesha was created,

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:21.702
in the sense that, though today is not a Tuesday,

00:12:21.903 --> 00:12:27.505
but according to dates of the moon,

00:12:27.706 --> 00:12:35.327
today is the day, first day of the moon in this month.

00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:37.063
[Marathi]

00:12:37.264 --> 00:12:41.138
Chaitra. We call it Chaitra. Chaitra is the month.

00:12:41.339 --> 00:12:43.072
And this is the time when –

00:12:43.273 --> 00:12:46.753
[Marathi]

00:12:52.166 --> 00:12:53.758
Gauri is the Chaitra.

00:12:53.959 --> 00:12:56.176
So the establishment of the Gauri

00:12:56.377 --> 00:12:59.064
is taken place during these nine days.

00:12:59.265 --> 00:13:03.199
But Ganesha has to be established before anything else.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.728
Though first Gauri had to come,

00:13:05.929 --> 00:13:11.327
you can see that. Gauri had to come first to establish Ganesha.

00:13:11.528 --> 00:13:15.569
But Ganesha is always put before even Gauri.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:22.118
Before the pujana of the, worship of the Ganesha,

00:13:22.319 --> 00:13:24.105
nothing starts;

00:13:24.306 --> 00:13:27.471
because He’s the one who takes out all the obstacles,

00:13:27.672 --> 00:13:30.441
all the negativities,

00:13:30.642 --> 00:13:33.151
all the hurdles that are going to come up,

00:13:33.352 --> 00:13:38.094
all the attentions that are here and there.

00:13:38.295 --> 00:13:40.830
So that’s why we first worship Ganesha,

00:13:41.031 --> 00:13:43.786
just to ask Him to protect us.

00:13:43.987 --> 00:13:45.749
But first the Gauri has to come,

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:50.796
and that’s how the Gauri is this nine days.

00:13:50.997 --> 00:13:57.929
She came on this Earth to fight the devils and demons,

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:05.999
negativity, for people to transcend

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.797
the Bhavasagara, the Void,

00:14:10.998 --> 00:14:14.567
the maya, the illusion.

00:14:14.768 --> 00:14:19.016
When they were praying, when they were doing anything,

00:14:19.217 --> 00:14:21.901
people used to obstruct

00:14:22.102 --> 00:14:27.249
and then they troubled the bhaktas, the devotees of God.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:33.791
Rakshasas, in those days the rakshasas were separate

00:14:33.992 --> 00:14:36.677
and the saints were separate;

00:14:36.878 --> 00:14:39.675
there was not such a mixture as it is today.

00:14:39.876 --> 00:14:43.156
We find in saints there are negativities sitting there.

00:14:43.357 --> 00:14:46.539
Was never so before. This is Kali Yuga.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.578
It’s such a confusion that there is no absolute saint

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:52.172
or there’s no absolute rakshasas.

00:14:52.373 --> 00:14:55.588
These rakshasas have come and sitting in our heads.

00:14:55.789 --> 00:14:58.434
They are within us, so the negativity is there,

00:14:58.635 --> 00:15:01.256
so we are not absolute saints.

00:15:01.457 --> 00:15:04.711
And this is the big problem of Sahaja Yoga is, that

00:15:04.912 --> 00:15:06.975
even when you are worshipping Me,

00:15:07.176 --> 00:15:11.346
try to be more on the saints than on the negative side.

00:15:11.547 --> 00:15:14.792
Try to be more on the saintly side.

00:15:14.993 --> 00:15:17.272
Because you are saints, no doubt,

00:15:17.473 --> 00:15:21.216
but these horrible things have somehow or other

00:15:21.417 --> 00:15:23.825
gone into your heads and they are sitting in

00:15:24.026 --> 00:15:27.735
your superego and ego, these horrible negativities,

00:15:27.936 --> 00:15:31.766
which you must really decide today to throw them away.

00:15:31.967 --> 00:15:37.219
Because you are really saints and these are the bad spots,

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.579
kalanka.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:42.999
Is the thing that really ruins you, is within you.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.110
So try to throw it away; try to become positive,

00:15:47.311 --> 00:15:49.885
be one with the puja.

00:15:50.086 --> 00:15:57.214
The second thing is the importance of this day is,

00:15:57.415 --> 00:16:03.728
that I have never celebrated this first day anywhere, so far.

00:16:04.876 --> 00:16:07.878
It was to be in Australia.

00:16:08.079 --> 00:16:11.872
It is the right of Australia to have this day here,

00:16:12.073 --> 00:16:14.713
celebrated here.

00:16:21.502 --> 00:16:25.697
We had other pujas, other Navaratris we had;

00:16:25.898 --> 00:16:28.215
with that I celebrated the first, second, third,

00:16:28.416 --> 00:16:30.072
over nine days we have done.

00:16:30.273 --> 00:16:32.265
But never this Navaratri as such

00:16:32.466 --> 00:16:36.415
we have celebrated this day anywhere, of the Shalivahana.

00:16:36.616 --> 00:16:40.425
Though in London they had a little sort of a thing on this, which I,

00:16:40.626 --> 00:16:44.411
we had on the seventh of April, then I spoke about it;

00:16:44.612 --> 00:16:49.969
but actually on this day we had no puja, before.

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:56.615
So, this is very creditable that it should happen here.

00:16:56.816 --> 00:17:03.778
I’m very happy, because this is where Gauri established Shri Ganesh.

00:17:11.006 --> 00:17:15.556
Now for today we have two things to be worshipped:

00:17:15.757 --> 00:17:22.905
one, Ganesha, because Ganesha can preserve our status,

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:26.756
our heights,

00:17:26.957 --> 00:17:28.733
in our realization.

00:17:28.934 --> 00:17:31.900
He protects us when we are getting our realization,

00:17:32.101 --> 00:17:34.170
we are rising high;

00:17:34.371 --> 00:17:37.755
so He preserves and He protects.

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:44.769
And He looks after us and gives us wisdom,

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:50.716
to have our ascent in such a way

00:17:50.917 --> 00:17:55.225
that we do not deviate into the left and the right side;

00:17:55.426 --> 00:17:58.241
we have full dignity;

00:17:58.442 --> 00:18:04.138
and that we are fully integrated with our heart,

00:18:04.339 --> 00:18:07.686
with Shiva Tattwa, with our realization,

00:18:07.887 --> 00:18:11.112
and do it with our heart genuinely.

00:18:11.313 --> 00:18:15.055
That’s why we worship Shri Ganesh.

00:18:16.102 --> 00:18:19.576
But today is actually the puja of the Gauri,

00:18:19.777 --> 00:18:22.084
that is, the Kundalini.

00:18:22.285 --> 00:18:25.620
So Shri Ganesh we’ll do first of all,

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.759
and then we’ll worship the Kundalini, which is the Gauri.

00:18:29.985 --> 00:18:35.713
Now luckily I got a sari: this is really remarkable,

00:18:35.914 --> 00:18:39.448
because this is the color of Australia.

00:18:39.649 --> 00:18:43.744
Green is the color of the Gauri. Gauri wears the green sari.

00:18:43.945 --> 00:18:47.738
And there is also – this is the, this is the,

00:18:47.939 --> 00:18:51.452
this is the symbol of Gauri only.

00:18:51.653 --> 00:18:57.004
This is the symbol of Gauri, and this one inside is the Ganesha,

00:18:57.205 --> 00:19:00.585
is in that color, is most surprising this sari I got.

00:19:00.786 --> 00:19:02.772
So this one also is just the other way round,

00:19:02.973 --> 00:19:06.832
more of Ganesha color and less of the Gauri color.

00:19:07.033 --> 00:19:10.927
This is a very traditional combination

00:19:11.128 --> 00:19:16.378
in the Indian color scheme, because red is the color of Ganesha.

00:19:18.305 --> 00:19:24.621
In you people it is very red and it can become more crimson,

00:19:24.822 --> 00:19:27.059
can become absolutely black,

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.172
can be absolutely reduced to nothing.

00:19:31.373 --> 00:19:40.822
But in Me it is the color of this clay,

00:19:41.023 --> 00:19:44.387
because it’s absolutely obedient, it’s absolutely one with Me,

00:19:44.588 --> 00:19:49.611
so it’s the color of the clay. And the Gauri is the Mother Earth.

00:19:50.673 --> 00:19:55.572
That’s the place where the Gauri exists, in the Mother Earth;

00:19:55.773 --> 00:19:57.915
and that’s why the color is green

00:19:58.116 --> 00:20:01.155
because Mother Earth is always covered with green,

00:20:01.356 --> 00:20:04.610
at least She’s covered with.

00:20:04.891 --> 00:20:08.681
And Ganesha’s color is that of the clay

00:20:08.882 --> 00:20:11.555
because He’s made out of the Mother Earth,

00:20:11.756 --> 00:20:14.841
element is the Mother Earth.

00:20:16.038 --> 00:20:21.967
I hope I have been able to explain to you the symbolic relationship.

00:20:22.781 --> 00:20:26.736
Do you know the story how Ganesha was created by Gauri?

00:20:26.937 --> 00:20:29.680
So that I will tell you; and then we all can have.

00:20:29.881 --> 00:20:34.966
It’s very interesting, that’s why I said I’ll have My bath here.

00:20:36.175 --> 00:20:37.175
It is said this ….

00:20:37.376 --> 00:20:40.804
[Excuse me, Mother, we can’t hear very well down the back.]

00:20:41.005 --> 00:20:43.484
[Is there any way You can speak louder or that we can hear better?]

00:20:43.685 --> 00:20:44.544
What’s she say?

00:20:44.745 --> 00:20:45.638
[They cannot hear.]

00:20:45.839 --> 00:20:47.064
You can’t hear Me?e …]

00:20:47.265 --> 00:20:48.265
[Yogini: No, Mother.]

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.214
All right, so I’ll have to shout.

00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:54.091
Not at all?

00:20:54.292 --> 00:20:55.642
[Yogini: Yes, a little, most of the time...]

00:20:55.843 --> 00:20:58.560
All right. Should I use this?

00:21:00.226 --> 00:21:03.132
All right. This you can hear.

00:21:05.936 --> 00:21:11.361
So I’m now going to tell you

00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:14.507
the story of Shri Ganesha’s birth.

00:21:14.708 --> 00:21:19.074
Is very interesting, it’s very symbolic. This is Christ, and that is,

00:21:19.275 --> 00:21:23.419
He is the Omega and He is the Alpha and all that they talk of,

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.867
they don’t know what they are talking.

00:21:26.068 --> 00:21:29.660
There’s so short form of what the whole thing is.

00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:32.290
They don’t know Ganesha at all, nothing.

00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:37.701
They just take one word here and there, just talk like that.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:43.227
So He’s the first one created.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.608
Now it’s very symbolic:

00:21:46.809 --> 00:21:49.881
the pure power

00:21:50.082 --> 00:21:57.582
of desire to be one with the spirit is symbolized in the Gauri.

00:21:57.783 --> 00:22:02.388
The primordial Gauri is that power

00:22:02.589 --> 00:22:06.563
which has separated from Her Lord,

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.588
we can say.

00:22:10.507 --> 00:22:14.061
In Her previous lives She was separated,

00:22:14.262 --> 00:22:17.924
and again She’s born as Parvati.

00:22:18.125 --> 00:22:23.593
And She wants to be one with Shiva, which is the Spirit.

00:22:25.191 --> 00:22:27.926
So now the marriage has taken place,

00:22:28.127 --> 00:22:31.860
in the sense that now She can meet Him.

00:22:32.061 --> 00:22:35.506
The wedding kindling has to start.

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.886
But She’s not yet married,

00:22:38.087 --> 00:22:39.972
in the sense that She’s still a Virgin,

00:22:40.173 --> 00:22:48.417
but married otherwise – means She is now about to rise.

00:22:48.893 --> 00:22:52.844
Before that She wants to have a bath,

00:22:53.045 --> 00:22:55.985
because She has to meet Her Lord.

00:22:56.186 --> 00:22:59.734
So She must have Her bath, the bridal bath.

00:22:59.935 --> 00:23:05.099
She’s a virgin, absolutely virgin, and She goes for Her bath.

00:23:06.155 --> 00:23:09.055
Now, She’s afraid that anybody might come inside

00:23:09.256 --> 00:23:12.177
when She’s having Her bath.

00:23:13.087 --> 00:23:15.346
Look at the delicacy of the whole thing:

00:23:15.547 --> 00:23:20.256
this desire, which just is meant for the spirit,

00:23:20.457 --> 00:23:22.734
doesn’t want to be exposed to anything else,

00:23:22.935 --> 00:23:26.552
any negativity coming in, anything happening like that.

00:23:27.341 --> 00:23:30.647
So She closes the door,

00:23:30.848 --> 00:23:35.699
but still She’s worried from the back side somebody may come.

00:23:36.201 --> 00:23:46.948
So She puts this scented powder, which we use in India,

00:23:47.149 --> 00:23:50.431
for the bride specially it is the right one,

00:23:50.632 --> 00:23:53.385
and rubs Her body with that, and She finds

00:23:53.586 --> 00:23:56.795
that a lot of it comes out. So She makes the Ganesha out of that,

00:23:56.996 --> 00:24:01.253
now imagine how much vibrated it must be.

00:24:04.795 --> 00:24:07.789
She puts that – is made of camphor

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:11.961
and all these beautiful things which are really celestial –

00:24:12.162 --> 00:24:16.701
and that is completely vibrated on Her body.

00:24:16.902 --> 00:24:22.441
She makes a Ganesha and puts Him to the back of the bathroom;

00:24:23.006 --> 00:24:25.673
She’s having Her bath nicely.

00:24:25.874 --> 00:24:30.971
At that time Shiva comes suddenly, knocks at the door.

00:24:31.172 --> 00:24:33.523
She doesn’t hear Him.

00:24:33.724 --> 00:24:39.606
So He goes from the back door. There
He sees Shri Ganesha sitting.

00:24:40.545 --> 00:24:42.889
He asks Shri Ganesha, “Who are You?”

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:47.679
So He says, “I am the Son of Gauri.”

00:24:47.893 --> 00:24:50.640
Shiva can’t understand; She is a Virgin

00:24:50.841 --> 00:24:53.704
and this one is saying, “I am the Son of the Gauri.”

00:24:53.905 --> 00:24:57.774
See now the Immaculate Conception,

00:24:57.975 --> 00:25:00.293
try to understand.

00:25:00.494 --> 00:25:08.440
So Shiva says, “How can She have a child? She is the Virgin.”

00:25:08.641 --> 00:25:13.443
And He thinks [She’s] He’s bringing slander on His wife who is a Virgin.

00:25:13.644 --> 00:25:18.155
So He cuts His neck in anger,

00:25:18.356 --> 00:25:20.958
and He enters into the bathroom.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.039
And Gauri is ready to receive Him.

00:25:25.246 --> 00:25:29.185
And She looks out and She sees Her child is dead.

00:25:29.386 --> 00:25:34.190
So He asked Her, “What is this?”

00:25:34.391 --> 00:25:39.119
Said, “That’s My child I created out of My, this mala” –

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:42.357
what you call this, all the body things that came out –

00:25:42.558 --> 00:25:46.236
“I’ve created Him, and I have put Him down there.

00:25:46.437 --> 00:25:49.265
How dare You kill Him?”

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.654
She said, “ Now what to do?”

00:25:51.855 --> 00:25:54.466
He said, “All right, what You do is to go

00:25:54.667 --> 00:26:02.231
and find the head of any animal that is available,

00:26:02.432 --> 00:26:06.583
and we will put that on this trunk

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.399
and He’ll be My son again.”

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.759
Now it’s all prearranged;

00:26:14.967 --> 00:26:18.878
because this child was not to grow into

00:26:19.079 --> 00:26:21.961
a human ego and superego business.

00:26:22.162 --> 00:26:26.333
It had to be the embodiment of childhood,

00:26:26.534 --> 00:26:31.869
embodiment of childlike innocence,

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:35.118
because He’s the embodiment of innocence.

00:26:35.319 --> 00:26:38.880
So they had to get the head of an animal.

00:26:39.081 --> 00:26:48.006
Now the wisest animal on this Earth is elephant,

00:26:48.207 --> 00:26:51.778
and elephant was saved in evolution in a very miraculous way,

00:26:51.979 --> 00:26:55.705
is also another description which I’ll give you later on.

00:26:56.089 --> 00:26:59.823
So a she-elephant, mother elephant

00:27:00.024 --> 00:27:03.907
was lying down with her back towards her child,

00:27:04.108 --> 00:27:07.655
that’s why in India women never sleep with their back

00:27:07.856 --> 00:27:09.999
towards their children, never.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.836
The child has to be in front, pudhe, in front.

00:27:14.037 --> 00:27:17.329
It should never be put at the back of the mother, never.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:21.050
Mother will get up and go on the other side and change the sides,

00:27:21.251 --> 00:27:23.819
but she would never put the child at the back.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.715
So the head of that little animal was cut,

00:27:27.916 --> 00:27:31.934
and He brought it and was put for Shri Ganesh.

00:27:32.135 --> 00:27:35.931
And that’s how Shri Ganesha was created.

00:27:36.132 --> 00:27:45.513
But you know, elephant is the conveyance of Mahalakshmi.

00:27:46.779 --> 00:27:51.465
So the body is from Mahakali,

00:27:51.666 --> 00:27:57.166
but the head is given by Mahalakshmi, the evolutionary power.

00:28:01.332 --> 00:28:09.229
Now this Ganesha within us resides

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:12.430
in the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:17.735
Some people who tried all kinds of tricks to find God

00:28:17.936 --> 00:28:24.256
must have seen the trunk of Shri Ganesha,

00:28:24.457 --> 00:28:27.067
and must have thought this is the kundalini,

00:28:27.268 --> 00:28:30.734
because as a Mother I give them few marks for that,

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.513
and that’s how they started all these perversions

00:28:33.714 --> 00:28:36.160
and wrong things about Ganesha.

00:28:36.376 --> 00:28:39.943
But He is embodiment of innocence,

00:28:40.144 --> 00:28:44.551
and later on you must read in “Devi Bhagwat”

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:50.759
how He incarnated on this Earth as Christ;

00:28:50.964 --> 00:28:54.871
and how He is going to come with His eleven powers

00:28:55.072 --> 00:28:57.846
on this Earth as Kalki.

00:28:58.047 --> 00:29:00.689
It is very difficult for Hindus to accept that Ganesha,

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:02.854
such a dynamic personality like Him,

00:29:03.055 --> 00:29:06.505
should become a person like Christ, who got Himself crucified.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.425
And it is impossible,

00:29:08.626 --> 00:29:10.654
at least Hindus have much wider knowledge

00:29:10.855 --> 00:29:15.840
and much wider sense, but it is impossible for ardent Christians

00:29:16.053 --> 00:29:21.844
to understand that Christ could be this elephant boy.

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:26.199
That is beyond them, because for them Christ should be a man

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:30.340
who has no power to kill anyone.

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.039
And then they say that He’s coming to kill us,

00:29:34.221 --> 00:29:37.806
I don’t know how they manage these things.

00:29:39.948 --> 00:29:42.418
They catch hold of one thing,

00:29:42.619 --> 00:29:44.892
like He was the Omega and Alpha, finished;

00:29:45.093 --> 00:29:48.588
now how are they authorized, God knows?

00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:52.189
But whatever it is, they do not see the other things,

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:55.568
that He had a Mother; He said about the Holy Spirit.

00:29:55.769 --> 00:29:57.813
He said it in such a good way,

00:29:58.014 --> 00:30:01.785
that “I’ll be sending Holy Spirit.” And also He said

00:30:01.986 --> 00:30:05.325
that “Those who are,

00:30:05.526 --> 00:30:08.316
those who have sinned against Me or have insulted Me,

00:30:08.517 --> 00:30:11.266
it’s all right, but with the Holy Spirit nothing will be tolerated”,

00:30:11.467 --> 00:30:15.150
very clearly. Why did He say so?

00:30:15.351 --> 00:30:19.364
He’s Alpha and Omega, but why did He say so?

00:30:19.565 --> 00:30:22.140
Of course, He’s the first who was created,

00:30:22.341 --> 00:30:25.152
and at this stage, at Kalki stage also it is He who,

00:30:25.353 --> 00:30:28.351
He’s there at the end of it, no doubt.

00:30:28.552 --> 00:30:30.442
But that doesn’t mean because you are Christians

00:30:30.643 --> 00:30:33.427
you have a special right.

00:30:33.628 --> 00:30:36.380
Not at all. On the contrary, I would say many Hindus

00:30:36.581 --> 00:30:40.864
have much more right on Ganesha than you have,

00:30:41.065 --> 00:30:45.252
because you have spoilt your innocence.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:49.216
They have not spoilt their innocence.

00:30:49.672 --> 00:30:51.359
So though you may call yourself Christians,

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:55.465
Christians and fight for Christ, but you are not;

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.211
because the basics of Christ is innocence,

00:30:58.412 --> 00:31:00.961
which we have ruined.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.919
So those who – also Sahaja yogis – get identified

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.213
with Christ must know that this identification is actually

00:31:08.414 --> 00:31:10.759
a conditioning;

00:31:10.982 --> 00:31:17.216
it is not factually so. If so, you have to become innocent.

00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:20.060
You must re-establish your innocence.

00:31:20.261 --> 00:31:25.583
Then you are really Christians, and then you are really so.

00:31:25.784 --> 00:31:29.199
And I would say people in India – as it is, you know,

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:33.596
luckily we did not get advanced as you people got.

00:31:33.797 --> 00:31:37.485
We never fall into the traps of advancement, luckily:

00:31:37.686 --> 00:31:40.435
too sluggish, elephant-like people,

00:31:40.636 --> 00:31:43.343
we could not fall into anything.

00:31:43.544 --> 00:31:46.914
India is like, large like an elephant.

00:31:47.115 --> 00:31:49.922
Anything comes in, this just goes on throwing this side,

00:31:50.123 --> 00:31:52.010
that side, that doesn’t accept anything.

00:31:52.211 --> 00:31:54.739
We never bothered about Freud. For us he’s some sort of

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:57.751
a legendary fellow living in fool’s paradise,

00:31:57.952 --> 00:31:59.905
we never accepted him.

00:32:00.106 --> 00:32:03.284
Nothing can penetrate that elephantine thing.

00:32:03.485 --> 00:32:07.724
You see, it just goes on blowing off all the things that comes round,

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:10.084
so nothing got into their heads.

00:32:10.285 --> 00:32:12.119
They never spoiled their innocence,

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.679
simply because they are too large and very lethargic

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:18.640
to new ideas.

00:32:19.599 --> 00:32:22.824
And that’s how they have, despite everything

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.899
they are not converted Christians,

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.924
they never heard of Christ, some of them.

00:32:27.125 --> 00:32:30.280
They have maintained their innocence much more

00:32:30.494 --> 00:32:32.972
and their sincerity of their heart,

00:32:33.173 --> 00:32:35.662
because they are not disconnected.

00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.999
When Ganesha is destroyed you get disconnected.

00:32:38.183 --> 00:32:42.148
Your heart works on one side, your brain works on another side.

00:32:42.349 --> 00:32:45.079
So, that they have not been able to yet achieve,

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.280
that kind of a dissociation. And whatever they may try,

00:32:48.481 --> 00:32:51.025
they know in their – that it is wrong.

00:32:51.226 --> 00:32:53.023
They may try, I mean, like people steal

00:32:53.224 --> 00:32:57.226
but they know it is wrong; in the same way they still know.

00:32:57.427 --> 00:33:02.769
So for us, we must know that we have to achieve

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:09.493
our position as innocent people.

00:33:09.747 --> 00:33:13.043
But your Mother is very gracious,

00:33:13.244 --> 00:33:16.848
She’s very powerful, She’s very loving,

00:33:17.049 --> 00:33:23.892
and She has created you on the same pattern as Ganesha.

00:33:24.115 --> 00:33:27.339
You have all the powers that Shri Ganesha has.

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.087
The greatest power that Shri Ganesha has,

00:33:30.288 --> 00:33:34.038
that you can come so close to Me.

00:33:34.903 --> 00:33:39.903
No other gods can come that close to Me as you can come.

00:33:43.018 --> 00:33:48.268
Kundalini cannot be risen by any gods, any incarnations

00:33:48.469 --> 00:33:51.523
but Shri Ganesha.

00:33:52.395 --> 00:33:58.254
He has to inform the kundalini, otherwise kundalini cannot rise.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:03.009
And it is you who have the power to raise the kundalini

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:05.640
on your fingers. How many powers I have given you.

00:34:05.857 --> 00:34:09.061
you have no idea at all.

00:34:09.262 --> 00:34:15.301
I have made you in the pattern of Shri Ganesh.

00:34:16.153 --> 00:34:19.260
So you have to establish that innocence within you;

00:34:19.461 --> 00:34:21.913
that is being also established.

00:34:22.114 --> 00:34:24.604
You’ll get back your innocence.

00:34:24.805 --> 00:34:28.701
But the second thing which is so important about Shri Ganesh

00:34:28.902 --> 00:34:30.267
one has to learn, that

00:34:30.468 --> 00:34:34.751
He does not know any other god but His Mother.

00:34:34.952 --> 00:34:38.905
For Him nothing exists but His Mother.

00:34:39.614 --> 00:34:41.695
He’s so dedicated.

00:34:41.896 --> 00:34:46.261
There’s a story once when Parvati,

00:34:46.462 --> 00:34:50.141
His Mother gave –

00:34:51.711 --> 00:34:55.435
said that “I will give You a big present,

00:34:55.636 --> 00:34:58.482
that there should be competition between You two brothers.”

00:34:58.683 --> 00:35:02.647
Second was the Kartikeya, the one, another brother of His

00:35:02.848 --> 00:35:06.949
who came on this Earth just to destroy this Narakasura.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:10.049
Is the, all the destructive powers

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.998
were combined to create Kartikeya.

00:35:13.199 --> 00:35:18.696
So She said, “Whosoever goes round this Earth,

00:35:18.897 --> 00:35:21.740
I’ll give You a prize.”

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:27.854
So, the conveyance of

00:35:28.055 --> 00:35:31.462
Kartikeya is such a fast one, is a peacock.

00:35:31.663 --> 00:35:36.045
So He got onto His peacock, started flying out like an aeroplane.

00:35:36.339 --> 00:35:41.525
And Shri Ganesha’s conveyance is just a little mouse,

00:35:41.726 --> 00:35:44.944
so what should He do? He took to wisdom.

00:35:45.145 --> 00:35:49.090
He said, “Who can be greater than My Mother?

00:35:49.795 --> 00:35:52.079
She has created all the gods.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.372
She’s the Mahakali, She’s the Adi Shakti.

00:35:55.573 --> 00:35:58.225
She has created all the gods, She has created all the universes,

00:35:58.426 --> 00:36:01.409
She’s the one who has done everything, who can be greater than Her?

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:05.767
She’s the greatest of all.” So she just, He just went round Her

00:36:05.968 --> 00:36:08.821
only thrice and He got the prize.

00:36:09.022 --> 00:36:13.279
And still He was flying in the air, Kartikeya.

00:36:13.576 --> 00:36:16.904
He fought even Shiva.

00:36:17.206 --> 00:36:20.049
He fought everyone.

00:36:20.286 --> 00:36:23.519
It’s a very interesting story how all that happened,

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:27.509
that shows complete dedication.

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:29.834
And for Sahaja yogis

00:36:30.035 --> 00:36:35.481
it is important to understand complete surrendering, dedication,

00:36:35.682 --> 00:36:41.955
and also a genuine feeling from the heart.

00:36:44.127 --> 00:36:47.833
I will ask Raul Bai sometimes to talk to you about the protocol,

00:36:48.034 --> 00:36:51.401
that’s important, though I am so close.

00:36:51.805 --> 00:36:57.322
Even Christ would not say anything;

00:36:57.523 --> 00:37:02.671
sometimes the way you people talk to Me, I am amazed.

00:37:03.207 --> 00:37:05.290
Certain things you say to Me, I’m amazed:

00:37:05.491 --> 00:37:10.166
how can you say these things to Me, knowingly what I am?

00:37:10.367 --> 00:37:13.406
But you forget.

00:37:13.649 --> 00:37:19.293
So it is important to understand that they were great

00:37:19.494 --> 00:37:24.391
because they knew the greatness of their Mother.

00:37:24.592 --> 00:37:27.952
In the same way, you all have to learn certain protocols

00:37:28.153 --> 00:37:30.590
which Raul Bai will teach you,

00:37:30.791 --> 00:37:34.603
so that you do not make any mistakes

00:37:34.804 --> 00:37:37.598
of saying things which are not proper.

00:37:37.799 --> 00:37:39.924
It comes from bad Vishuddhi, no doubt,

00:37:40.125 --> 00:37:43.065
but consciously if you work it out

00:37:43.266 --> 00:37:46.461
you will do good to yourself; because you know,

00:37:46.662 --> 00:37:49.475
anything against the Holy Spirit won’t be tolerated,

00:37:49.676 --> 00:37:53.574
anything, can you believe it?

00:37:54.071 --> 00:37:58.097
What strong words these are! Just think of it,

00:37:58.298 --> 00:38:02.290
anything against the Holy Spirit.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.661
So one has to understand the protocol, for Sahaja yogis,

00:38:06.862 --> 00:38:11.640
for Sahaja yogis, don’t talk against the Holy Spirit.

00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.098
But the protocol is there which one must understand,

00:38:15.299 --> 00:38:18.467
and how far to go, how far to understand

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:24.394
is very, very, absolutely rudimentary for Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:24.882 --> 00:38:27.369
So today we have a great day

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:35.140
of Shri Ganesha’s Mother being established, incarnated.

00:38:35.341 --> 00:38:39.366
Today is the day She had Her bath, we can say,

00:38:39.567 --> 00:38:42.836
and that’s why I said I’ll come and have a bath here.

00:38:43.037 --> 00:38:45.037
About the times and timings,

00:38:45.238 --> 00:38:48.073
one should know that Mother knows best,

00:38:48.274 --> 00:38:51.861
and everything works out with the timing properly.

00:38:52.062 --> 00:38:57.515
Because the, you know you are, you are ahead of India,

00:38:58.476 --> 00:39:02.388
and all the timings work out in that way.

00:39:02.589 --> 00:39:06.171
So everything has to work in the way,

00:39:06.372 --> 00:39:08.796
actually the timings are of the moon,

00:39:08.997 --> 00:39:11.572
so you don’t have to worry about what is the timing,

00:39:11.773 --> 00:39:13.654
what time this works out, this thing, that.

00:39:13.855 --> 00:39:16.264
The watches and all that, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:16.465 --> 00:39:20.911
work out according to My understanding.

00:39:21.112 --> 00:39:25.800
So one has to relax and just enjoy the puja.

00:39:26.001 --> 00:39:29.126
I think today you are going to receive lots of vibrations.

00:39:29.327 --> 00:39:31.495
Just enjoy them, just enjoy them.

00:39:31.696 --> 00:39:34.491
And if your ego is there or anything,

00:39:34.692 --> 00:39:38.254
just ask them to shut up, that’s all.

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:41.598
All right?

00:39:41.799 --> 00:39:45.669
Now, so first we’ll have Ganesha Puja,

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:47.538
as Modi will be doing,

00:39:47.739 --> 00:39:51.899
and he will be explaining what is to be done.

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:56.115
How Ganesha is pleased with small, small things you will see now.

00:40:00.832 --> 00:40:03.816
[Hindi]

00:40:05.596 --> 00:40:09.070
Who will come for the – children should come for the puja?

00:40:09.271 --> 00:40:13.267
Let all the children come for the puja.
