02:27.529 --> 02:38.514
Today is a very important day in
the history of spirituality.

02:38.715 --> 02:50.992
The Ekadasha Rudra Incarnation has been
prophesized by every prophet,

02:51.193 --> 03:02.009
that the Ekadasha Avatara will be coming
and it will destroy all the negativity,

03:02.210 --> 03:07.883
all the anti-God activities.

03:11.660 --> 03:19.848
Ekadasha Principle actually is built
in [the] Void

03:20.049 --> 03:27.991
because when the saints wanted to cross

03:28.749 --> 03:35.086
the ocean of illusion through their
meditation,

03:36.592 --> 03:47.684
they were hindered, troubled, tortured
and slaughtered by negative forces.

03:49.502 --> 03:53.669
These negative forces came up

03:55.875 --> 04:03.969
through the failings of human beings.

04:04.170 --> 04:10.212
When human beings failed, they saw
other people

04:10.413 --> 04:14.426
who were so much better than them

04:14.627 --> 04:33.022
and they saw that they are nowhere compared
to many other human beings,

04:33.223 --> 04:38.439
or sometimes out of anger and temper

04:40.201 --> 04:47.769
the villainous temperament grew into them

04:47.970 --> 05:05.623
and then it formed this anti-God negativity
in the Void.

05:05.824 --> 05:22.313
So Void has given actually the villainy to
come into form.

05:24.892 --> 05:31.550
As you see, in Sahaja Yoga, we must have
seen it many a times

05:31.757 --> 05:38.783
that when you go to a wrong guru
or to a wrong person

05:38.984 --> 05:49.887
or you do unauthorised worshipping,
your left Void catches.

05:51.990 --> 06:01.549
So in the left Void all those destructive
forces acted.

06:04.175 --> 06:17.724
Also in the process of evolution, there
were many plants, animals

06:17.955 --> 06:24.598
who were destroyed because they were
not in the centre.

06:24.799 --> 06:29.254
Because they were egoistical, some were
cunning,

06:29.455 --> 06:37.837
some were too big, some were too small.
And they were all thrown out.

06:38.057 --> 06:47.555
And when they were thrown out, they felt
that they must react.

06:47.758 --> 06:51.314
So they went into the collective
subconscious

06:51.515 --> 07:04.553
and came as subtler entities to harm
the people who were ascending.

07:06.095 --> 07:10.039
Like we see these days viruses that
attack us.

07:10.240 --> 07:14.719
These are the plants which have gone
out of circulation.

07:14.920 --> 07:19.712
After some time you will find tobacco
will go out of circulation,

07:19.913 --> 07:24.958
many drugs will go out of circulation.

07:25.240 --> 07:35.265
All these can form a kind of anti-growth,

07:35.466 --> 07:46.745
anti-development, anti-freedom forces
within ourselves.

07:46.946 --> 07:58.542
So in the area of Void these horrible
negative forces were formed.

07:58.743 --> 08:06.910
In the same way, many human beings
who were born

08:08.362 --> 08:19.355
and tried to assert their ego, went into
egoistical processes

08:19.556 --> 08:22.769
and thought that they can control people,

08:22.970 --> 08:26.856
they can have their domain over all
the human beings,

08:27.057 --> 08:32.481
they can overpower the whole world.

08:32.682 --> 08:44.121
All such people form a very powerful
institutions in the history.

08:44.322 --> 08:52.613
And today also there are many such forces
coming into existence.

08:52.814 --> 08:59.246
These forces are building and destroying
every moment;

08:59.447 --> 09:07.529
they are building into our Void area, and
then they are destroyed.

09:08.386 --> 09:13.591
These people when they come from
the right side,

09:13.792 --> 09:19.011
from the right Void, we call them
as supra-conscious,

09:19.217 --> 09:25.830
and those who come from the left side,
we call them as the subconscious entities.

09:26.031 --> 09:34.639
All these entities do exist, as human
beings are the image of God,

09:34.840 --> 09:41.752
as in the collective subconscious
of God Almighty,

09:41.953 --> 09:49.001
and also in the supra-conscious of God
Almighty.

09:49.202 --> 09:54.323
These forces still remain till they go
to hell.

09:54.524 --> 09:59.984
In the same way in us also, in human
beings also,

10:00.185 --> 10:08.777
these forces exist and they try
to overpower us.

10:10.737 --> 10:18.931
It is very remarkable that we had this
Puja in Austria,

10:20.415 --> 10:33.673
because in the geography of this world
Europe is the Void,

10:33.882 --> 10:42.194
and in that Austria is the one where we
should have

10:42.395 --> 10:55.470
anti-negative forces built up
to fight the negative forces.

10:55.671 --> 11:03.033
It is such a right place to have this Puja.

11:03.234 --> 11:08.984
And I am really thankful to all the Sahaja
Yogis

11:09.192 --> 11:15.038
who have chosen this place for Ekadasha
Rudra puja.

11:17.703 --> 11:22.855
In the modern times as we see today,

11:23.056 --> 11:29.655
these forces are acting in very subtler
manner,

11:29.856 --> 11:35.932
in a manner that human beings cannot
understand.

11:38.226 --> 11:41.582
And they are driven into it.

11:41.783 --> 11:47.684
If you see the way we are drifting
from reality,

11:47.885 --> 11:57.384
the way we are getting tempted by
superficial nonsensical things,

11:57.585 --> 12:04.693
the way we have horrible diseases waiting
at our doorsteps,

12:04.894 --> 12:14.386
we realize that we are standing on
the verge of falling into a mire,

12:14.587 --> 12:20.409
from where we may never rise, we may
never come up.

12:22.777 --> 12:26.527
So we have to understand what is within us

12:26.728 --> 12:39.015
which can destroy for ever this
anti-development,

12:40.459 --> 12:53.346
anti-evolutionary, anti-constructive
temperament of the nature.

12:55.550 --> 13:04.487
In the nature, if you see, everything
circulates in a very regular manner.

13:04.688 --> 13:10.790
For example in the winter time the leaves
have to fall down,

13:10.991 --> 13:19.861
because the nitrogen of the leaves has to go
into the Mother Earth to nourish the trees.

13:20.030 --> 13:28.251
Moreover the Mother Earth must get
sun’s rays.

13:28.452 --> 13:34.808
so there should be no leaves and
the sun’s rays can penetrate

13:35.009 --> 13:38.784
into the Mother Earth to nourish her.

13:39.975 --> 13:50.073
Then the trees when they are nourished they
again become green and lush

13:50.274 --> 14:00.665
so that they receive the sun’s light
and make chlorophyll out of them.

14:02.334 --> 14:11.843
Also they suck in the water from the Mother
Earth and throw them in the atmosphere

14:12.020 --> 14:17.445
to act as catalyst for the rain to come.

14:17.646 --> 14:20.758
Then the rain comes during the rainy
season,

14:20.959 --> 14:32.908
then again nourished with water the life
again [starts].

14:33.109 --> 14:39.789
They lose all their leaves and the whole
circle goes on in a beautiful manner.

14:39.990 --> 14:44.374
There is no reversion, it is just
a continuous circle

14:44.575 --> 14:51.142
going in a very beautiful manner to create
and recreate.

14:53.262 --> 15:02.377
But with the interference of man nature
gets disturbed.

15:02.578 --> 15:08.212
Also you can enhance the nature,

15:08.577 --> 15:15.316
you can save the nature’s destruction
which could be natural also.

15:17.076 --> 15:24.436
But when you get your realisation, when
you get your realisation,

15:24.637 --> 15:31.216
then with your vibrations you can save
all natural things

15:31.417 --> 15:36.637
that are decaying under the modern
influence.

15:36.891 --> 15:43.528
So first of all, we see the effect
of realisation

15:43.729 --> 15:48.715
how it acts as Ekadasha Rudra.

15:48.916 --> 16:00.122
It destroys the negative forces which are
trying to destroy the nature.

16:03.325 --> 16:08.236
One day I am sure you all will evolve
to such a state

16:08.437 --> 16:16.762
that even your glance is sufficient
to make the trees grow,

16:16.963 --> 16:24.784
to make the fruits sweet, to make
the flowers fragrant.

16:25.601 --> 16:33.366
That’s possible because our growth
is showing results.

16:33.567 --> 16:36.749
Slowly, slowly it is showing results,

16:36.950 --> 16:40.464
because you should not be stunned, you
should not be shocked,

16:40.681 --> 16:47.720
so that you can see for yourself what you
are and what you are achieving.

16:50.042 --> 16:54.149
But to allow this force within us to grow,

16:54.350 --> 16:59.466
first of all, we should be very
introspective,

16:59.713 --> 17:06.709
we should try to see ourselves, what is
happening to us?

17:06.910 --> 17:09.309
We must watch our steps.

17:09.552 --> 17:17.065
Are we moving towards our construction
or towards our destruction?

17:17.266 --> 17:20.117
What are we doing?

17:20.318 --> 17:25.724
This Ekadasha Rudra force which is
within us

17:25.925 --> 17:30.034
is so powerful, is so very powerful

17:30.235 --> 17:38.512
that not only in nature but also in human
beings it acts.

17:41.590 --> 17:50.221
It acts in a way that you are shocked and
surprised at.

17:50.422 --> 17:54.869
There is a gentleman whom I had given
realisation, he’s very dedicated,

17:55.070 --> 18:00.532
but he is not in a place where he can come
to Sahaja Yoga.

18:00.733 --> 18:05.200
And some people tried to trouble him very
much.

18:05.401 --> 18:07.378
And he told Me they all met with
an accident

18:07.579 --> 18:12.032
and all of them are now lying
in the hospital.

18:12.737 --> 18:15.919
So I said, “I didn’t do anything.

18:20.240 --> 18:25.357
By their own doings they have crossed
the limits.”

18:25.558 --> 18:31.588
And if you cross the limits of goodness,
naturally you go [grow] something

18:31.789 --> 18:34.874
what we call as evil.

18:35.075 --> 18:41.308
And if you fall into the ditches of evil,
you have to suffer.

18:42.656 --> 18:46.915
But also it acts on Sahaja Yogis.

18:47.116 --> 18:53.169
I have known of a Sahaja Yogi who tried
to be little funny about money.

18:53.370 --> 18:57.419
I did not think that he should be punished.
I never thought of such a thing,

18:57.620 --> 19:01.991
that he should be punished, really,
but they acted,

19:02.192 --> 19:07.568
his own forces acted against him.

19:07.769 --> 19:11.947
And he got so sick, so very sick

19:12.148 --> 19:18.500
that in My presence he used to just shake
like a dried leaf.

19:21.286 --> 19:26.301
I never even told him that, “I know
what you are doing.”

19:29.859 --> 19:33.667
In Sahaja Yoga when you enter,
you have to know

19:33.868 --> 19:41.568
that slowly and steadily you are climbing
up a very steep road.

19:41.769 --> 19:52.424
Because it has to be very quick, so
the rise is very steep.

19:52.625 --> 19:56.008
And when you are climbing up that rise,

19:56.209 --> 20:01.918
you have to know, if you don’t go further
you’ll slip down.

20:02.119 --> 20:07.189
But if you move sideways you will
fall down.

20:07.390 --> 20:17.241
You may say that, “Mother, we are moving
sideways, so there is a movement”,

20:17.442 --> 20:22.717
because you’re falling down also one may
feel the movement.

20:23.043 --> 20:26.302
That is the movement of destruction.

20:26.480 --> 20:29.814
So you must have proper discretion about
yourself.

20:30.015 --> 20:34.583
Are we ascending or descending?

20:34.784 --> 20:44.025
Are we losing our steps? Are we going
higher in our steps?

20:44.226 --> 20:48.168
Which sometimes we do not realize

20:48.369 --> 20:59.646
that we are amidst the worst possible
negativity in the history of this universe.

20:59.839 --> 21:04.932
In the olden times there would be only one
rakshasa at a time one had to deal with.

21:05.133 --> 21:09.768
It was so easy to deal with one rakshasa.

21:10.510 --> 21:22.191
But to deal with so many of them already
needs lot of work.

21:22.392 --> 21:26.365
But the worst part about it is that
in the modern times

21:26.566 --> 21:32.352
these rakshasas have entered into
the brains of people.

21:32.553 --> 21:39.856
Because of their teachings, because of
their delusions people have accepted them,

21:40.057 --> 21:43.117
and these people are My children.

21:43.318 --> 21:47.740
They are seekers, they are seekers
of Truth.

21:47.941 --> 21:56.146
It’s like people using children for
a ransom.

21:56.971 --> 22:04.061
They put the children before Me and I don’t
know what to do:

22:04.229 --> 22:10.859
if I try to kill the devils, then
the children are in front.

22:12.127 --> 22:16.943
So which is the best way is to destroy
in modern times?

22:17.144 --> 22:20.490
Of course, they can be killed, they can
die,

22:20.691 --> 22:27.049
but how am I to save the people whom they
have polluted, whom they have wronged?

22:27.250 --> 22:34.225
It’s a very, very difficult and very
delicate work.

22:35.669 --> 22:42.176
For that there’s only way is to bring them

22:43.360 --> 22:49.221
to a point where they get completely
exposed, they are debased,

22:49.431 --> 22:55.923
and the whole world knows who are they,
how they look like.

22:56.129 --> 23:03.554
So instead of fighting them from outside or
just asking Yama to go and kill them,

23:03.755 --> 23:16.341
is best is to make their own being caught
into the web of Ekadasha Rudra,

23:16.542 --> 23:22.340
so that they are exposed to people by their
misdeed.

23:22.541 --> 23:31.317
That is the advantage, I should say, a part
of the ugly game of falsehood.

23:31.518 --> 23:34.888
Falsehood always gets exposed.

23:35.089 --> 23:42.021
You can see written large on their faces
their hypocrisy,

23:42.222 --> 23:51.018
their evil intentions and their satanic
schemes.

23:53.053 --> 24:00.071
As I said that modern times are the worst
for these attacks.

24:00.272 --> 24:07.223
We have to be more alert, more aware,
more understanding.

24:07.424 --> 24:12.634
As Sahaja Yogis you all are very well
equipped.

24:12.801 --> 24:19.408
but we all the time forget that we have
got our vibrations,

24:19.609 --> 24:23.747
that we have got a new awareness
of vibrations.

24:23.980 --> 24:30.098
We have got vibratory awareness and this
vibratory awareness

24:30.299 --> 24:39.621
are a kind of a messenger which is
absolute,

24:39.853 --> 24:42.577
which communicates and which tells us

24:42.778 --> 24:46.651
what’s wrong with others, what’s wrong
with us.

24:46.852 --> 24:59.289
But if you start taking your decision
through your mental, emotional enterprises,

24:59.490 --> 25:09.659
then be sure that you’ll be misguided,
because all these endeavours are one-sided.

25:09.860 --> 25:15.378
Like a mental projection goes like this in
a linear way, falls upon you;

25:15.579 --> 25:23.690
and also an emotional one does the same.
Even the physical is just the same.

25:23.898 --> 25:27.531
But when you start seeing through
the vibrations,

25:27.732 --> 25:33.571
what do you do is to ask your Spirit
to communicate to you,

25:33.772 --> 25:38.251
and the Spirit is the absolute knowledge.

25:38.452 --> 25:43.784
So you do not succumb to your conditioning
or to your ego

25:43.985 --> 25:50.632
or to any other training or any other guru
but yourself.

25:50.833 --> 25:55.217
So it is very important for all of you

25:55.963 --> 26:00.728
to understand that we are not going to take
any decision

26:00.917 --> 26:07.610
on our mental level but on our vibrations.

26:08.316 --> 26:12.987
Many people think that if I say something
about someone,

26:13.188 --> 26:18.042
[it] may be because they have reported it
to Me.

26:20.590 --> 26:24.398
But supposing if I am the source of all
the vibrations,

26:24.599 --> 26:28.918
what is there for Me to get reported?

26:30.741 --> 26:33.556
Why should anybody report to Me? If they
want to report they may,

26:33.757 --> 26:37.593
but I know what exactly is the situation.

26:37.794 --> 26:45.895
Once in Rahuri I was waiting in the Guest
House

26:46.096 --> 26:51.288
and about five, six professors came
on their bikes.

26:51.489 --> 26:54.820
[They] came and told Me, “Mother, we have
come to warn You

26:55.021 --> 27:00.023
about a particular gentleman.” I said,
“Who is this gentleman?”

27:00.224 --> 27:02.207
They gave the name of this gentleman

27:02.408 --> 27:06.624
and said, “You have to be very careful,
he is a politician.”

27:06.825 --> 27:11.351
I said, “Alright, that’s all you know about
him?” They said, “Yes.

27:11.552 --> 27:15.404
So you have to be very careful.”
I said, “Now I’ll tell you about him,

27:15.605 --> 27:20.998
that this man has not married his ‘wife’.

27:21.199 --> 27:25.960
She is the wife of somebody else and he has
eloped with this woman.

27:26.184 --> 27:29.076
And the child is his,

27:29.277 --> 27:33.139
but this lady was raped by him, that’s how
he’s got the child.”

27:33.340 --> 27:36.158
When I started telling, you know, they all
started

27:36.359 --> 27:39.717
raising their eyebrows and opening
their eyes.

27:39.918 --> 27:43.738
They said,: “Mother, how do you know?”
I said, “You go and find out

27:43.946 --> 27:52.532
whatever I am saying, is it true or not.”
They were completely stunned.

27:52.733 --> 27:55.337
They went back and then reported to Me

27:55.538 --> 28:00.641
that, “Mother, it’s surprising, what You
said was the truth.”

28:00.842 --> 28:06.499
So on vibrations you can know everything,

28:06.700 --> 28:12.159
but those who try to decide things without
vibrations,

28:12.360 --> 28:16.101
can make mistakes, till you reach
a certain stage

28:16.302 --> 28:21.155
where you don’t have to spread your hands
to ask, just you will know.

28:21.474 --> 28:24.868
But to go to that stage you have to,
first of all, surrender

28:25.069 --> 28:30.069
your discretion to vibrations.

28:30.752 --> 28:34.274
Now some people don’t have proper
vibrations.

28:34.475 --> 28:40.140
Maybe their Vishuddhis are bad. They should
take proper care of their Vishuddhis.

28:40.340 --> 28:43.737
Even then, if they don’t have some physical
problem on the Vishuddhi,

28:43.938 --> 28:48.186
they can feel it within themselves what
chakras are catching,

28:48.387 --> 28:55.257
what is happening to this gentleman.
Normally, because we are in modern times,

28:55.458 --> 29:01.493
the people who are possessed

29:01.701 --> 29:06.820
appear more beautiful than the people
who are not possessed.

29:07.021 --> 29:10.804
Once we had a lady who came to us
in our programme.

29:11.005 --> 29:16.167
She was completely possessed, thin like
a beanstalk, absolutely,

29:16.368 --> 29:19.421
and everybody – that was the beginning
of Sahaja Yoga –

29:19.622 --> 29:22.682
felt that what a beautiful woman has come.

29:22.883 --> 29:26.254
When I told them to keep her out
of the hall for the time being,

29:26.455 --> 29:29.601
they couldn’t understand.

29:30.418 --> 29:35.088
Then she got cured and she looks
very different now,

29:35.289 --> 29:41.217
to Me she is very beautiful. The beauty
that was seen at that time

29:41.418 --> 29:45.921
must have been the camouflage
of the negativity that people saw.

29:46.122 --> 29:50.259
Like as you see these cinema actresses,
cinema actors

29:50.460 --> 29:56.704
and some of the clowns who move
as presidents, this, that.

29:56.905 --> 30:02.316
You can see it written large on their
faces, how horrid they are.

30:02.517 --> 30:09.819
But unless and until you yourself are
of that level and sincere,

30:10.020 --> 30:13.036
you won’t be able to make it out.

30:13.237 --> 30:20.583
Today what we are doing is to awaken within
us this Ekadasha Rudra force,

30:20.784 --> 30:24.812
which will help you to fight your own
negativity

30:25.013 --> 30:27.994
and fight the negativity of the whole
world.

30:28.202 --> 30:32.117
Now we have so many hands,
so many people

30:32.318 --> 30:37.355
with different what we call them ayudha,
means the weapons.

30:37.556 --> 30:41.829
All these weapons are with you, they are
within you

30:42.030 --> 30:46.053
and you can definitely use them,

30:46.254 --> 30:51.588
but first you must know what weapons
you are carrying and how to use them.

30:51.789 --> 30:57.572
There’s so much blind faith. There is
so much of wrong ideas,

30:57.773 --> 31:04.778
so much of organisational fortresses they
have built.

31:04.979 --> 31:10.854
All kinds of nonsensical things are going
on in this world,

31:12.881 --> 31:18.731
but they’ll all be finished. Nobody will
know anything about them

31:18.932 --> 31:26.031
except that they might know [be known] as
some villainous creatures on this earth.

31:26.232 --> 31:31.349
Ultimately the living will exist.

31:31.550 --> 31:33.968
We have to know that we know the living
force

31:34.169 --> 31:36.689
and we have to be very sure about it

31:36.920 --> 31:43.080
and we have to be proud about it that we
know what is the living force.

31:43.281 --> 31:51.169
Then this Ekadasha Rudra within us becomes
very strong.

31:51.370 --> 31:57.937
Anybody who tries to trouble you will have
a nice punch.

31:58.944 --> 32:04.033
Any organisation which tries to subdue
Sahaja Yoga

32:04.234 --> 32:10.459
or in any way harm it, will have a nice
time.

32:10.660 --> 32:15.236
Like you know, I went for Merv Griffin
Show and he misbehaved.

32:15.437 --> 32:20.935
Next week that show was closed down.
No more.

32:21.136 --> 32:26.374
In India there was a newspaper which tried
to make a funny article out of Me.

32:26.575 --> 32:33.112
The newspaper was closed down for months
together, just it happens.

32:33.279 --> 32:39.490
I don’t say anything of the kind, but
the way things happen is very surprising

32:39.691 --> 32:46.569
how this Ekadasha is now active.

32:46.770 --> 32:53.705
Also the most significant thing is that
this Ekadasha is going to act

32:53.906 --> 32:59.264
only in Kali Yuga, in these modern times.

32:59.465 --> 33:08.767
Earlier it was not going to act because
there was hardly one guru -

33:08.968 --> 33:13.453
who is today a ‘guru’, must have been
the Satan last time -

33:13.630 --> 33:24.291
only one horrible rakshasa there,
so it was very easy to kill him.

33:24.521 --> 33:31.387
To kill Kamsa it took no time for
Shri Krishna,

33:31.588 --> 33:36.860
or to kill Ravana it took no time for
Shri Rama.

33:37.061 --> 33:42.819
And once they have killed, the whole thing
becomes clean start.

33:43.020 --> 33:48.980
But here they are like mosquitoes. So many
of them!

33:49.181 --> 33:52.772
One after the another, there’s no end
to it.

33:52.973 --> 33:56.454
And they have entered also into the being
of human beings

33:56.655 --> 34:00.512
giving them diseases, all kinds of problems
and tortures.

34:00.697 --> 34:07.059
So the problem is much more deeper and
very very complicated.

34:07.260 --> 34:14.092
That is why Ekadasha Rudra, which has got
eleven destroying powers.

34:14.293 --> 34:18.716
We say that there are ten

34:21.041 --> 34:28.017
(Hindi) directions, you can say,

34:28.444 --> 34:36.907
and this is the eleventh. So ten from
outside, one from inside.

34:37.108 --> 34:43.877
All these eleven forces can act on to
anyone

34:44.086 --> 34:48.575
who tries to hamper the progress of Sahaja
Yoga

34:48.776 --> 34:53.626
or even to say something against Me
or against you people.

34:53.827 --> 34:58.810
Anybody who tries to trouble you it will
act.

35:00.779 --> 35:06.538
On the physical level it appears on your
forehead here.

35:06.739 --> 35:12.262
The Ekadasha Rudra shows on your forehead,
and you get a swelling over here.

35:12.463 --> 35:16.157
Some people, you must have seen, have
a furrow here

35:16.358 --> 35:20.086
and a huge, big thing coming out.

35:20.287 --> 35:24.094
Mostly the cancer patients, if you see
them, they have

35:24.302 --> 35:29.068
from left it rises to the right side quite
a lot,

35:29.269 --> 35:34.132
a bump there, on the right hand side,

35:34.333 --> 35:38.330
and there are some who have got
on the left hand side.

35:38.507 --> 35:42.772
So from the left hand side it rises, goes
to the right side,

35:42.973 --> 35:46.925
and the one which rises from the right side
goes to the left side.

35:47.126 --> 35:50.588
So the more dangerous ones are which go
to the right side,

35:50.789 --> 35:56.736
because they are the ones who are very sly,
which we cannot see,

35:56.937 --> 36:02.458
which are hiding, which can harm you
very much.

36:02.659 --> 36:09.098
So all these horrible things that are
acting today

36:09.299 --> 36:19.840
can be completely destroyed if we develop
our Ekadasha Rudra within ourselves.

36:21.420 --> 36:29.711
They are not so powerful: one Sahaja Yogi
can kill thousands of them,

36:30.195 --> 36:36.090
while they cannot harm even one
Sahaja Yogi.

36:36.291 --> 36:46.287
So they are really powerless before you,
they have no way of torturing you.

36:46.488 --> 36:55.325
In case you are a powerful person, they
will all disappear and disappear forever.

36:55.526 --> 36:59.708
I remember once there were three Sahaja
Yogis in India

36:59.909 --> 37:04.904
who used to go by a particular road
in a village.

37:05.105 --> 37:11.268
So one lady got possessed and she started
doing, “Ho, ho, ho,” like that.

37:11.469 --> 37:17.946
So they said, “Why are you here?” She said,
“We are here in this lady to tell you

37:18.147 --> 37:21.984
that please tell these three Sahaja Yogis
not to go by that road,

37:22.185 --> 37:25.766
because now we have run away from all
the villages

37:25.967 --> 37:30.284
and we are just residing in that area, and
if the Sahaja Yogis go through that also

37:30.485 --> 37:33.584
the whole night we’ll be jumping around.

37:33.785 --> 37:36.836
So better ask these three Sahaja Yogis not
to come that way

37:37.037 --> 37:42.546
so that at least we’ll have some place
to reside.”

37:43.711 --> 37:48.338
These are, as I told you, gone out of
the circulation of evolution,

37:48.539 --> 37:52.283
so these are dead, dead people.

37:52.484 --> 38:00.040
And these dead people can in their subtle
bodies enter into us and form entities

38:00.241 --> 38:04.943
and those entities can grab us and can
possess us.

38:05.144 --> 38:07.876
Such possessed people look quite normal.

38:08.077 --> 38:16.747
As I was saying today homosexuality,
over sexuality, no sexuality,

38:16.948 --> 38:32.199
then we can say no aesthetics, or too much
of artistic tendencies.

38:32.400 --> 38:40.355
Then we can say too much of eating
and hunger

38:40.556 --> 38:48.799
or eating nothing at all, fasting.

38:49.000 --> 38:54.634
Then not afraid of anyone, “What’s wrong?”,
for everything, “What’s wrong?”,

38:54.835 --> 39:01.913
not afraid of God, or afraid of even
an ant.

39:02.278 --> 39:06.778
Then there are people who feel guilty
all the time,

39:06.979 --> 39:11.085
or those who make others feel guilty

39:11.286 --> 39:16.112
as if the other person is good for nothing
– they too.

39:16.313 --> 39:23.668
Plus we have another kind who are very,
very cruel,

39:23.869 --> 39:28.741
that they can entrap people, can make
their own slaves,

39:28.942 --> 39:34.331
can work out anything horrible, wars,
by their own talking.

39:34.532 --> 39:39.479
And there are others who subjugate
themselves to these evil people

39:39.680 --> 39:46.545
and accept their dominance and try
to destroy other people

39:46.746 --> 39:52.253
in the glory of these dominating
personalities.

39:52.454 --> 39:58.659
Then comes the area of Sahaja Yoga

39:58.860 --> 40:05.840
where nobody can enter in, you are
perfectly happy there.

40:06.041 --> 40:13.850
Ekadeshas are standing round you on your
forehead to look after that area.

40:14.051 --> 40:19.121
They are watching you, they are guards,
and nobody can harm you.

40:19.322 --> 40:22.939
You are very nicely settled down there
in the Sahastrara,

40:23.140 --> 40:33.124
and nothing can touch you, nothing can
even bring a slur on you.

40:33.325 --> 40:40.091
They are very alert and they have
many facets -

40:40.292 --> 40:46.732
each deity has many facets - and all these
facets are all the time

40:46.942 --> 40:55.552
throwing light in that area so that there
is no intruder to enter in.

40:55.754 --> 41:00.582
This is what you have got within yourself.

41:00.783 --> 41:07.251
And when anybody tries to enter into this
area of Sahastrara,

41:07.452 --> 41:13.181
immediately they react and can harm
the other man to such an extent

41:13.382 --> 41:18.702
that you are yourself amazed and you don’t
know how it has happened.

41:18.903 --> 41:23.829
But to develop this force we have
to meditate with sincerity,

41:24.030 --> 41:28.838
with understanding. Not with just words
before the photograph to say,

41:29.039 --> 41:33.509
“Mother, I surrender myself to You”,
this, that. Sincerely.

41:33.710 --> 41:37.565
Because the deities know who is sincere,
who is innate,

41:37.766 --> 41:44.060
who is the one who is really trying to rise
and ascend.

41:44.261 --> 41:48.581
It is a struggle in a way. It is a struggle

41:48.782 --> 41:54.201
but it is not the struggle which will not
bring you any fruits.

41:54.402 --> 41:58.225
Otherwise, all other struggles give you
no fruits.

41:58.426 --> 42:04.650
But this struggle is so simple and so
already explained

42:04.851 --> 42:09.168
and worked out that you don’t have
to worry too much.

42:09.369 --> 42:17.989
So today, we have to invite all these
forces of Ekadasha Rudra

42:18.190 --> 42:22.907
to destroy the negativity in this Kali Yuga
completely.

42:23.108 --> 42:27.380
Also to pray that if there is any
negativity within us,

42:27.581 --> 42:29.666
it should be destroyed.

42:29.867 --> 42:33.984
If there is any negativity against Sahaja
Yoga, it should be destroyed.

42:34.185 --> 42:37.337
Anywhere in our character and in our
understanding,

42:37.538 --> 42:40.415
if there is any negativity, it should be
destroyed.

42:40.586 --> 42:44.963
This is today’s message for you on Ekadasha
Rudra.

42:45.185 --> 42:48.447
May God bless you.
