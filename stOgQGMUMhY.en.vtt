00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.880
Now let us see what are the states of attentions are.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.320
Either your attention would be a cunning attention.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.280
Anything you see, you see from a cunning angle.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.240
Many people develop that in an ego-oriented society.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.480
And moreover if you are sort of possessed by cunning bhoots,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.720
then God save you and save others.

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:38.160
Like the cunning attention would be that,
anything you see, you start thinking

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.440
"What advantage I can take out of this.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.280
How much money I can save", you see.
It's very, very quick.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.000
"It would be cheaper this way."

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.120
"If I go by this way I'll save some time",

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.360
you see, "save pounds", "save time",

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.280
save everything and save your own Self.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.920
So just to save you are going on.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.480
The attention becomes cunning when you try to save money.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.920
Save here. Save there.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.320
With your own calculations.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.280
But if you try to save the money spontaneously,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.840
actually there is nothing to be tried,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.160
just it happens that you save.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.800
But the cunning attention tries all the time

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.160
to be smart about things.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:44.480
It argues, it gives explanations,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.240
"Is it better....?" These days

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.800
it's such a cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, thing
that you go mad really.

00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:51.941
Like I had a ticket to go to America.

00:01:52.062 --> 00:01:57.080
I said, "Don't give Me an expensive ticket, first class, or ....I'll go by a cheap ticket".

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.040
So they gave Me a ticket, of such a kind

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.480
that, I would never have come back to London

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.880
at least for a year,

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.960
and I would have lost in that American English,
I tell you, somewhere.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.760
So it's so much [they ?] had worked out,
you know, this into that, into that.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.520
That kind of a horrible attention is useless.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.880
Leave it, forget it.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.360
With that saving also I've not seen anybody becoming rich.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.720
Like you want, I want to go and buy some paint.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.440
So we buy some paint.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.080
Then they think, "All right, if you bring it back,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.560
then how can we return it,

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.960
what should we do, this, that." Nonsense!

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.200
All the time the mind is on that level.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.480
I'll give you an example, the other day

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.960
we got some paint to paint the glass.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.440
See the subtle part of it,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.080
you see, in the gross there is a subtler indication,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.640
and the paint was brought.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.920
And then, it was worth nothing, eighty p (pence) or something.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.760
All right, I mean I can afford it,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.000
so that's why I bought.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.520
If you can't afford don't buy!

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.120
So they said, "Now we should return" I said,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.160
"But why? Now it's come out, now go and return.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.280
You spend so much petrol going there.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.520
If you want to calculate also it's stupid,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.440
and the time you'll be wasting."

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.240
"No but Mother, you see, ultimately we save two p!"

00:03:35.576 --> 00:03:38.960
I said, "All right, now I'll save a lot
of money, and I'll show you how."

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.320
I took that paint and painted many things

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.880
which looked like glass, or which was stone-like,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.760
and the whole thing looked so beautiful.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.080
So the mind that is destructive is only calculating.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.901
If you have such a mind know yourself

00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:04.616
that you have to get rid of that kind of a calculation.

00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:07.040
Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, things

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.680
you should just give up.
Keep in the centre.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.640
You should not be, of course, over-indulgent.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.640
But you should not be also going for, all
the time, for this kind of a calculation,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.800
because you are wasting your important awakened attention

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.520
which very few people have in this world.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.520
Must know that you are realized souls,

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.960
you are not ordinary mundane type of people.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.280
You are special people and you are not to waste

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.960
your attention in useless calculating money, 'p',

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.640
and this and that.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.320
Let's go ahead. What happens, let's see.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.720
I never calculate you know that, but I live very cheaply,

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.400
and you can also do that.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.680
This attention, cunning attention,

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.120
is also a very fussy attention.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.760
Here it starts saving money

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.520
and then, there it is in the evening it must drink.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.840
So all the saving of p, p, p, p, goes into

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.680
the gutters of drinking.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.640
Just sin. The sum total of such a personality is what?

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.960
So this mentality has to be controlled.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.080
Specially for ego-oriented people are extremely calculating

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.880
most surprising it is.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.000
But the people like Indians who are not calculating

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.680
are not so rich.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.360
They are very generous, they always have money for Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.640
I have had never a problem of money with them, never,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.520
because they are not so calculating.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:07.160
To them, to do for others, not for yourself, but for others.

00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:10.039
To spend for others.
If they have to come to your house:

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.480
"All right, open your heart. Now this is the time to spend."

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.080
Not for drinking and self-indulgence,

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.640
but for the indulgence of doing for others.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.280
That's their practice and tradition.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.520
So in this respect, you have to take to that tradition:

00:06:26.641 --> 00:06:31.961
"Oh they have come. Let's spend now.
What can we do?"

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.200
This is the main thing one should understand,
those who are mostly self-indulgent

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.800
are extremely miserly people.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:52.160
So the attention which is cunning,
is the worse attention, because you see,

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.560
cunningness also cheats yourself. It is cunning with you,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:00.520
and you think, "Oh I've been smart
enough, you see, I've saved two p".

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.480
But you have lost your soul.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.640
You are no more a Sahaja Yogi.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.760
I'll give you an example.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.240
I told somebody that,

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.800
"Keep the van down there, go by train,

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.400
this van seems to be a horrible van."

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.800
And there was a lot of a, you see, explanation,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.640
with both the fingers going on like this to Me, you see,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.640
and I got so fed up with the bomb shells coming on Me

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.920
that I said, to go ahead.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.880
And the thing fell,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:53.090
and the thing got spoilt or whatever it is,
is out of order now.

00:07:53.211 --> 00:07:55.199
So they had to do what I was telling them.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:00.760
Without the bomb shell, if they had listened to Me
it would have been all right.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:08.400
So your attention should not be on saving material things

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.720
and worldly things and all that,

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:17.480
but attention itself must be saved.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.640
Ask a question, "Where is my attention?".

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.360
I've seen in the programs

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.760
some people are concentratedly listening to me,

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.840
but some people cannot.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.960
Some are concentrated for a short while,

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:36.240
and some get disinterested after some time.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.400
Some are looking here. Some are looking there.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.120
So how much attention you have saved is the only concern

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.680
of a Sahaja Yogi. Forget about others,

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.920
they are all garbage cleaners, you see.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.280
Forget about others who are not seeking,

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.160
who are not of your quality, but you are a quality.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.960
Now what do you have to save?

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.520
For example somebody is a king.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.640
He doesn't bother of two p being saved.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.080
I don't know baba, these days, I can't say definitely!

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.280
They must be also doing that kind of a thing, you know, but

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.480
what is he bothered to save his grace, to dignity.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.920
But for a Sahaja Yogi the most important thing is,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.200
you must save your attention.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.160
It's called as Chitta Nirodha.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.440
Nirodh -- is saving of your attention.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.760
"Where is it going, It's such a precious thing for me.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.480
Where is it running?"

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.920
Then how do you save your attention?

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.960
Is through concentration.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.880
Concentrate. Try to concentrate.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:52.400
Don't allow your attention to wobble.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:58.760
Gradually you will develop concentration.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:04.600
You can watch My photograph, it's the best.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:07.520
Concentrate, bring it in your heart,

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.000
let it be integrated in your heart.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.600
You are lucky people,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.200
you don't have to build up a photograph,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.760
and then give it up because it is just a Avalambana,

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.720
means it's just a dependence,

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.160
and then you remove it.

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.680
It's a complete dependence for you

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:33.960
and a load for Me -- of complete joy.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.360
So when you are concentrating in Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:43.480
absolutely fully in Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:49.120
then you are controlling, saving, your attention.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:52.600
This is one type of people.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.400
Then the another type of an attention, what we call,

00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:05.760
are the people who are sort of take a very negative attitude.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.320
The first are the positive, so called,

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.160
so called positive,

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:19.000
who are saving money, saving everything that is useless.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:26.960
Now the second type are the archbishops of all that is disaster,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.400
misery, mishaps

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.680
This type of an attention.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.240
If you read newspaper every morning

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.480
you will have an attention like that.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.240
All the newspaper people have that kind of an attention,

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.200
to find where is the disaster.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.440
I mean, in a sinister way,

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.960
they feel happy there's a disaster.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.520
I've seen people, "Oh Mother, I came to the seminar

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:56.440
but the problem is, you see, there was no water."

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.440
The attention is in finding disasters

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.360
within and without.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.520
"What happened?", "There's a disaster",

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:10.960
"What happened?" "I lost the pin".

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:18.680
Absurd, to have such stupid ideas.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:22.400
They will cry and weep and make everyone miserable,

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.640
"Oooh, I'm so miserable."

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:29.000
"What?", "My husband doesn't talk to me",

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.800
or "My child is not with me."

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.120
Such people are extremely self-indulgent

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.480
as far as their relationships are concerned.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:39.440
They make everyone like that,

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.840
"Oh, the person didn't talk to me nicely

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.680
and he was this way and that way."

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:47.880
They feel hurt at the slightest touch

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.360
and by that they think they are saving their emotions

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.258
if not the material things.

00:12:57.379 --> 00:13:00.159
Such people are very frightened people to talk to anyone,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:03.200
and anybody says nice things also, they get a fright,

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.400
like this, they'll frown.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.920
The reason is they do not know what they have to save,

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.600
is not their emotions at all.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.784
There's no need to save your emotions, you are protected.

00:13:14.905 --> 00:13:17.463
What does it matter if somebody says anything to you,

00:13:17.584 --> 00:13:21.720
you are above there, nobody can touch you!

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.320
You are wasting your attention all the time

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:32.480
by trying to save your emotions.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.360
There's nothing to be frightened of anyone,

00:13:38.481 --> 00:13:41.105
because somebody is going to say something, harsh word,

00:13:41.226 --> 00:13:45.132
that's why you don't want to do something.
Such compromising people,

00:13:45.252 --> 00:13:47.480
so called,

00:13:47.879 --> 00:13:49.519
have not understood Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:58.040
There is no compromise in Sahaja Yoga at all.
It is just like a diamond.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.920
Diamond will remain a diamond whatever you do,

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.520
it's for ever and ever,

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.760
it's like that.

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.720
So one has to understand that the attention should not be allowed

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.640
to drift into this kind of an indulgence

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.880
which is of a drunkard,

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.440
that, they are the most miserable people, the drunkards are

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:28.400
Just imagine. They'll be always crying, weeping,

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:33.880
and people would think they are very miserable.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.560
So what you have to save at that time is your attention

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.440
from such indulgences

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.680
into useless expression of your fear

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.720
about your emotions.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:54.050
The third one is a very horrid idiotic one.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.666
The idiotic one comes from the second type,

00:14:57.787 --> 00:15:04.050
where the person is emotionally indulgent.

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.570
That is the "A" of the third.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:10.050
And the "B" of the third comes from the first type,

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:14.010
which is stupid. So we have two types of people,

00:15:14.170 --> 00:15:19.130
one idiotic and another are stupid.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.010
But in Indian language there's only one word,

00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:26.610
specially in Marathi -- is murkha.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.530
For them both categories are the same,

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:33.650
as if the circle meets at the same point.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:40.450
I mean English language in some ways is good

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:44.810
at least it differentiates between the murkhas,

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:48.090
like they can be stupid or they can be idiotic, you see.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.610
Because of psyche being so confused here,

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:55.090
that psychologists have brought out. Some are schizophrenic,

00:15:55.250 --> 00:16:02.970
some are idiots, some are stupid, some are donkeys.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:11.650
So this, the third type is the worst, is most frustrating for Me.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:13.770
They'll stick onto Me like leeches,

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.170
they'll be saying stupid things all the time.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.210
Just can't bear an idiot, isn't it?

00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:23.010
They can bore a person. I mean all sorts of this put together

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:24.570
is called as murkha.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.370
So I don't want to analyze it, it's a bit too much.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:33.170
So that kind of an attention you have, then you better keep quiet.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:40.090
Don't talk. Just listen to others what they talk, what they say.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:43.690
There are some people who will just go on talking, talking, talking,

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:48.410
irrelevantly, uselessly, wasting their energy,

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:51.770
and such people are always friends of the cunning.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.370
The cunning and such people go hand in hand,

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.850
because the cunning wants to befool someone,

00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:00.370
and the fool wants to be befooled.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.650
Like a king will have a jester,

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:06.610
it's like that you see, these combinations work out.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:11.890
So for such people the best thing is to keep quiet.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.530
Preserve all their attention,

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:19.050
all their energies just for cleansing.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:24.290
All this idiocity will pass away very soon

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:27.890
if you try to preserve yourself. Don't talk,

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:32.250
don't say things which are stupid,

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:38.850
which are idiotic, just keep quiet, and watch others.

00:17:38.971 --> 00:17:44.290
Sometimes such people can become
very great vehicle of God's power,

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:51.290
but if they do not take to stupidity and idiocy.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:56.610
This is the type of people, three types I would say,

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:02.330
but the fourth type are the people who lead a life of concentration.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.850
I mean a person who is working very hard,

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:09.850
say, in the office, is a very remarkably successful person,

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.690
and this and that, and that, and that, and that,

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:15.050
is also very concentrated.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.850
Somebody who works very well, anywhere,

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:21.370
with a concentrated mind, is concentrated.

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:26.290
A housewife who looks after her husband and children is very concentrated,

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:29.490
and a husband who looks after his family

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.850
and his things in a very concentrated way.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.650
They know how to paint well, they know how to do things,

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:38.570
and their hands are deft, and they know everything.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:45.450
But such people can have a very immobile attention,

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:48.650
very immobile, like plastic,

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:53.050
or you can call it, like rubber.

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:55.930
At the most, to improve on it, we can say,

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.650
like some of the things I have seen which you use

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.850
for damp-proofing, you see,

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:07.490
you just apply it, after some time it's just parched, into it.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:09.970
They just can't get out of it.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:12.730
They just can't. They can't enjoy anything.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:16.090
Unless and until you show them a file you can't talk to them.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:21.490
You see, if you have to talk to such a
person, better take a file before you,

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:25.290
and before starting you put the file before you.

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:31.370
If it is on the file only, they will see,
but if you talk, they say, "Make a file."

00:19:31.675 --> 00:19:34.915
Very parched, and they cannot enjoy life.

00:19:35.036 --> 00:19:37.569
There's no mobility, they cannot be creative.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:42.290
They can be creative only as far as their style is concerned,

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:47.530
but not the creative of the joy.

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:50.370
So that kind of concentration is there,

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.410
concentrated effort people put in.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:55.130
Like there are people who are fanatics.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:57.810
They are very concentrated in their effort, extremely.

00:19:57.931 --> 00:20:00.778
That's how all these religions have spread, like Christianity,

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:05.650
Islam, Hinduism and all that, because they
had a concentrated effort of fanaticism

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:08.650
concentrated effort.

00:20:08.771 --> 00:20:12.690
If you read the letters of Paul in the Bible,
you will see the concentration of it:

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.210
"You go there and you go there and establish a church and do this"

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:20.730
and "What you have done?". Very organized, very systematic,

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:28.810
absolutely moving like a belt on a machine.

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:35.370
And they all the time have that after effects of that movement.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:39.370
Charlie Chaplin has shown in his picture "Modern Times".

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.290
I used to enjoy that very much,

00:20:41.411 --> 00:20:46.431
that he used to tie up a belt, you see,
standing for about an hour, and then

00:20:46.552 --> 00:20:49.696
after some time when he was released of the job,

00:20:49.817 --> 00:20:53.690
he used to go on like that.

00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:56.450
That kind of an attention,

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:59.810
that is concentrated, means stuck onto something.

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:03.210
It's not that, it's not penetrating.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:06.170
Because if your attention doesn't become, by concentration,

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.690
subtler and subtler, then it is not that

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.290
but it is getting stuck, and the stuck attention

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:14.810
is of no use for Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:19.090
Such people, I do not know, will never be saved perhaps.

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:21.850
So called successful.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:25.690
They'll go with all their badges, everything,

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.850
and God will say, "Go back gentlemen,

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:33.090
you are not yet been passed through the customs."

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:37.130
There is another organization,

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:42.050
which works much faster, much smarter way,

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:47.130
and a very specially efficient thing.

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:53.450
So these people will be just 'stuck' people.

00:21:56.130 --> 00:22:02.770
Now there are fourth type of people which are concentrated.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:07.450
They are intense, deep.

00:22:08.337 --> 00:22:12.668
They penetrate because they are living minds.

00:22:12.788 --> 00:22:17.478
Theirs are not dead, parched minds,
they have living mind, they penetrate.

00:22:17.599 --> 00:22:22.569
I watch sometimes, I ask some people
"What do you think of a particular person?"

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:26.130
Immediately I know, what they talk.

00:22:26.251 --> 00:22:28.770
If they just talk in a mundane way,

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.690
"He is a fine person, he is a bad person, this thing, that thing",

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:37.090
then I know what it is. Very superficial, shallow.

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:42.930
But a person who sees the possibilities and the potentialities of

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.610
it's awakening, and the problems a person is facing,

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:50.330
then I know that he is the one who has that concentration

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:52.890
into the subject.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:59.648
And the subject of Sahaja Yoga requires
the maximum, maximum, penetration,

00:22:59.769 --> 00:23:02.455
because Sahaja Yoga, if you have understood,

00:23:02.575 --> 00:23:05.850
I don't know if you have understood
or you are aware of it or not,

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:11.130
but is learned through experience and through nothing else.

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:16.730
You have to experience and then believe into it.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:20.490
It is not that what I told you is a conditioning on your mind,

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.410
nothing, you experience it yourself and learn.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:26.730
But those who have that penetrating intelligence,

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.210
who have that penetrating love, emotions

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:37.890
and those [who] have that penetrating
movement of their understanding,

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:41.370
they are the ones who experience, learn, experience,

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:43.890
learn, experience, learn.

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:46.850
They do not allow their mind to play on them,

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:49.050
"No, no, no.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:53.370
This mind of mine has got experiences of the past,

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:59.810
and is based on that. No, I have
to take everyday a new experience

00:24:00.050 --> 00:24:03.410
and that experience must be silenced within me,

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:06.930
must be sustained within me,

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:11.490
must be conditioned within me."

00:24:11.650 --> 00:24:18.170
Sahaja Yoga experiences are the good conditionings,

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:20.930
"How can it be? I've seen it,

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:26.610
I have faced it, I've had it. How can it be?".

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:31.450
But for that also, to have the best experiences,

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:34.918
first condition is of Rutambhara Pragnya,

00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:39.010
where you should be of that level
that you really get those experiences,

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:43.530
otherwise you'll be just a mundane
type of a person all the time,

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:45.410
and you may live with Me,

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:47.450
but you will not have those experiences,

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.450
you'll not have that blissful feeling,

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:52.850
nothing, that joy.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:25:00.770
So this penetration starts by your meditation

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.290
and sustenance of the meditation,

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:09.810
and the Samadhi seed sprouting,

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:14.130
manifesting the new dimension within.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:21.370
This sort of an attention, one has to develop,

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:24.930
by watching the attention, Chitta Nirodha.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.770
As you watch your money,

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.650
as you watch your road when you drive,

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:32.370
as you watch your child when it is growing,

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.650
as you watch the beauty of your wife,

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:39.170
or the care of your husband.

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:44.650
All put together, you watch yourself, your attention,

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:51.050
where is it going?
Where is it lagging behind?

00:25:51.219 --> 00:25:54.979
What is happening to my attention?

00:25:56.570 --> 00:26:00.010
Such people have no problems.

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:04.490
You'll be surprised, that such people

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:08.170
when they want to do something it becomes dynamic.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:12.010
They can work it out. Nobody has any problem,

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:16.409
and if there is a problem,
which you are facing all the time,

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:20.610
in you then know there is something wrong with you.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:23.930
Something is wrong with the instrument.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:25.490
If you don't have a tin cutter

00:26:25.611 --> 00:26:29.521
and you start using a knife to cut a tin, doesn't work out.

00:26:29.642 --> 00:26:32.410
Then you'll say, "The tin is, something wrong with the tin",

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:36.702
or something wrong with you?
No, it's wrong with the instrument

00:26:36.823 --> 00:26:39.757
and that instrument has to be corrected.

00:26:39.878 --> 00:26:46.130
When the instrument is all right,
after all, with all the powers you have,

00:26:46.290 --> 00:26:50.690
with all the blessings you have,
and the source of power behind it,

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.930
everything should work out.
It should work out.

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:58.090
You have had experiences of things working out.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:02.690
You have had experiences

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:07.770
of many of miracles happening before your eyes,

00:27:07.930 --> 00:27:12.130
but still the attention has not settled down

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:16.130
with those experiences. Still 'gatanubhavas'

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:20.130
means the old experiences continue.

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:25.650
Old identifications continue.
You still continue with that

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:29.170
and the filth of that is still on your being.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:34.050
Change everything.
Become a fresh new person.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:40.610
You are blooming out as a
flower and then as a tree

00:27:40.770 --> 00:27:43.770
and assume your position.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:51.570
Assume your position as the Sahaj yogi.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:55.890
So this attention must be brought round.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:28:00.210
You judge yourself, where is your attention

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:04.050
and what is the point of understanding?

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:07.970
What is the measure of understanding?

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:13.170
It's very simple: I have to be pleased.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:16.970
Because I'm the attention.

00:28:17.507 --> 00:28:22.147
If I am pleased then you have done the job.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:25.450
But I cannot be pleased by mundane things,

00:28:25.571 --> 00:28:31.011
by any arguments with that, but only by your ascent.
