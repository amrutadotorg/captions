00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
Diwali Puja. Los Angeles (USA),
9 November 2003

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.120
Today is the great day of Diwali.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.520
That means today is the great day .....(?)

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.580
lights of your heart together

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:21.417
to make a greater light

00:00:21.709 --> 00:00:26.125
for the world to move in a proper direction.

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:34.500
It's a day of great joy, and those who join in this,

00:00:34.792 --> 00:00:38.208
are spreading also great joy.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.125
But the problems are there, as they say,

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:51.500
but for us there is no problem because there is no darkness,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.125
we don't see any darkness anywhere,

00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:58.208
we see lights, and lights, and lights.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:11.125
Then what is the thing missing, missing is our sincerity.

00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:16.125
We have to be very sincere with ourselves,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.125
because it is not just a borrowed love or a borrowed joy,

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:28.625
but it is from within the source,

00:01:28.917 --> 00:01:31.917
it's flowing, flowing and flowing.

00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:40.208
So that is to be awakened, and that love should flow,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.000
and our small petty things like jealousies

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:52.917
and competitions and all those things which spoilus

00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:55.709
must be washed away.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.709
And it can be washed if your heart is full of love.

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:12.333
Today is a day of spreading love, light of love,

00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:20.125
so that everybody feels enlightened and happy

00:02:20.625 --> 00:02:24.917
and forgets these petty problems.

00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:38.041
I am happy that you have been able to get some hall,

00:02:40.041 --> 00:02:42.333
it's all luck that we got it,

00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:46.208
people were so much worried about getting a hall.

00:02:48.542 --> 00:02:50.834
But it has just happened,

00:02:52.125 --> 00:02:58.834
so you should know also that our destiny is all also

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:01.125
guided and looked after.

00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:04.417
You are already blessed people,

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.417
there is no doubt about it.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.625
And we should not worry about small things and small matters.

00:03:12.917 --> 00:03:16.417
It will all work out very well, you will see,

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.625
if you just leave it to your destiny, which is very high,

00:03:23.917 --> 00:03:29.917
very great - in this your own destiny you will go very far.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.250
This is the promise of Diwali

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.417
to you all, that you will reach highest

00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:48.250
and the noblest way of life.

00:03:51.542 --> 00:03:56.333
Every word I say will be there

00:03:57.542 --> 00:04:00.250
to prove what I say is there.

00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:06.041
Whatever petty problems you have,

00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:08.250
they'll all be washed off.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.542
All these are the messages from the Divine,

00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:17.458
you don't have to worry about petty things,

00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:25.041
about money, about jobs, that's not your job.

00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:28.250
Your destiny will work it out.

00:04:29.166 --> 00:04:35.333
You have a promise that you'll be looked after.

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:41.667
I hope you believe in that promise

00:04:43.542 --> 00:04:49.458
and are joyous in the highest way.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.540
I bless you all from my heart, all of you,

00:04:56.834 --> 00:04:59.542
for a very happy and prosperous Diwali.

00:05:02.041 --> 00:05:03.667
Thank you very much.
