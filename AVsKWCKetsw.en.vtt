01:38.583 --> 01:43.250
Sorry. I’ll tell you how it’s to be done, you see.

02:01.792 --> 02:02.667
Now all right?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.625
You have to go from forward backwards,

02:05.999 --> 02:10.208
otherwise the hairs start coming forward.

02:42.834 --> 02:46.000
Is it all right for you people?

02:57.125 --> 02:58.625
Just hold it.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.959
This is rather a big one, you see, just –

03:01.250 --> 03:03.750
just a minute, I’ll take it.

03:43.917 --> 03:47.250
Hold it, eh? I’ll just put it right. Just hold it.

04:35.083 --> 04:38.834
In Krishna’s – this is Krishna’s country, you see,

04:39.208 --> 04:42.500
and it has to be everything upside-down.

04:53.458 --> 04:58.041
All right. Big problem!

05:39.709 --> 05:41.917
Now let Me see.

05:52.583 --> 05:55.417
Now it’s better.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.208
Yes, it’s better idea.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.625
Put it that way.

06:42.041 --> 06:44.834
I look like a

06:48.333 --> 06:51.375
Red Indian lady;

06:54.125 --> 06:57.041
Inca, Inca-style.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.250
All right?

09:52.083 --> 09:55.458
Both hands.

13:32.166 --> 13:35.917
Somebody should take a full photograph.

13:42.041 --> 13:46.291
I hope you get some miraculous photographs.

15:17.999 --> 15:21.000
Aarti …[Marathi]

23:43.875 --> 23:45.792
Just give the bandhan there.

23:46.041 --> 23:49.291
Kundalini’s just clearcut.

23:51.834 --> 23:53.083
No, anti-clockwise.

23:53.333 --> 23:55.917
No, no, there, at ….

24:16.375 --> 24:18.709
Just bow down. Let’s see.

24:25.875 --> 24:30.166
Keep bowing down. We want to see your kundalini.

24:56.583 --> 25:01.041
It’s all right. Now you try on him. Just move it.

25:11.750 --> 25:13.291
Swadisthan.

25:18.417 --> 25:20.834
Center Heart.

25:21.875 --> 25:25.417
So hold it tight, hold it.

25:32.709 --> 25:35.542
He’s all right.

25:48.417 --> 25:52.375
You just see his kundalini, at Nabhi.

25:55.542 --> 25:58.917
Just bow down. Is he all right?

25:59.375 --> 26:03.834
Left Swadisthan and the Nabhi. You come now.

26:10.041 --> 26:15.959
Bandhan there. Now you are all right. You are all right.

26:29.166 --> 26:32.500
Everybody. Let us see everybody. It’s better to watch it.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.750
You come along just one minute.

26:35.083 --> 26:38.041
I want to see everybody’s kundalini. Now, it’s good.

26:41.458 --> 26:43.458
Now Doug, you are all right. You are all right.

26:43.792 --> 26:45.583
But in the Vishuddhi, throat, little bit.

26:45.834 --> 26:47.333
All right, now, let’s see, one by one.

27:08.542 --> 27:12.000
Now just put both the hands forward.

27:57.959 --> 28:01.333
Just see, his kundalini.

28:28.125 --> 28:32.917
Come along. See, his vibrations.

29:29.333 --> 29:31.709
Ah. All right?

29:32.041 --> 29:35.417
No, left – not all right. We’ll see, now.

29:39.250 --> 29:40.875
Michael.

29:45.000 --> 29:49.333
Hold your breath. Hold your breath. Hmm.

29:50.542 --> 29:52.792
Leave it.

30:02.458 --> 30:05.333
Leave it.

30:22.834 --> 30:27.792
Ah. Nabhi.

30:28.667 --> 30:31.458
All right?

30:34.166 --> 30:36.417
Are you all right?

30:36.792 --> 30:40.000
Let’s see. Started now.

30:49.375 --> 30:51.458
You are perfectionists, all of you!

30:51.834 --> 30:54.041
He himself is a perfectionist.

31:13.999 --> 31:16.750
Heart.

32:02.000 --> 32:06.500
Done! Been worried a bit too much.

32:06.875 --> 32:11.208
Nothing to worry. It’s done now, all right?

32:12.917 --> 32:17.125
She’s all right, now. She’s all right.

32:17.792 --> 32:20.083
Are you all right? Why?

32:20.709 --> 32:25.709
Hold it, hold it there. Hold your breath for a minute.

32:26.625 --> 32:29.999
Leave it now ….

32:31.709 --> 32:33.875
You come here. This lady.

32:34.208 --> 32:35.917
Yes, you come here.

32:36.208 --> 32:40.208
She’s catching on the center Heart. Now, hold it .

32:42.959 --> 32:47.417
… Sit down, sit down. Now, bow.

32:55.125 --> 32:59.250
Hah! Leave it.

33:15.250 --> 33:18.542
Center Heart …

33:45.250 --> 33:48.709
Void … She went to some gurus?

33:49.333 --> 33:51.125
You have been?

34:07.875 --> 34:10.959
…. I don’t know what is it ….

34:12.083 --> 34:14.792
What is it? ….

34:16.500 --> 34:19.208
Builders of the ….

34:28.041 --> 34:30.792
Center Heart you are catching.

34:31.125 --> 34:34.792
Hold your breath, please.

34:42.208 --> 34:45.333
You leave it.

34:47.999 --> 34:50.917
Again hold your breath.

34:56.709 --> 35:00.333
Hah! Leave it.

35:00.959 --> 35:05.250
Again hold your breath.

35:07.458 --> 35:09.000
Are you better now?

35:09.375 --> 35:12.250
Hah! Leave it.

35:12.834 --> 35:16.500
How are you?

35:17.999 --> 35:19.583
Left Agnya.

35:20.041 --> 35:21.583
You’re all right.

35:21.917 --> 35:24.625
Is she all right? See her vibrations.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.625
She has to work it out on her left.

35:26.917 --> 35:29.834
Left is problem, I think.

35:31.834 --> 35:34.166
Center Heart [Marathi]

35:40.458 --> 35:45.166
Ah! Now it’s good

36:07.542 --> 36:11.083
… Now. All right.

36:16.750 --> 36:20.542
Have you got one like that? Smaller one?

36:28.500 --> 36:31.542
… Are you all right now?

36:31.917 --> 36:34.083
You got caught up with others.

36:34.417 --> 36:38.625
Don’t get worried. Nothing to worry.

37:30.709 --> 37:32.917
First class!

37:33.208 --> 37:36.291
Put your right hand towards that. That’s right.

37:36.709 --> 37:38.291
And left hand towards Me. Now.

37:38.709 --> 37:43.709
Why do you hear so many things? Just now take it …

37:51.750 --> 37:54.917
Very good, excellent.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.625
Tell her how to do it.

38:01.917 --> 38:04.291
Little this side.

38:04.709 --> 38:09.458
You tell her, little this side.

38:10.083 --> 38:13.417
Put it, hah ….

38:23.959 --> 38:26.709
Left Nabhi.

38:51.959 --> 38:54.166
How is he? ….

38:55.792 --> 38:58.458
left Swadisthan

39:40.875 --> 39:43.500
Better?

39:46.500 --> 39:49.291
How many days you did that?

39:52.250 --> 39:55.542
Not for a long time?

39:57.083 --> 40:00.333
About how many years?

40:14.917 --> 40:21.583
Put it next to the light. Higher. Fixing the light there.

40:26.166 --> 40:28.917
In between, you have to hold your breath.

40:29.208 --> 40:32.375
[Marathi]

41:12.083 --> 41:14.625
Ah! Good.

41:15.041 --> 41:17.458
You’re all right now.

41:17.834 --> 41:20.500
All right?

41:20.999 --> 41:24.375
What happens in Vancouver?

41:28.999 --> 41:32.333
Must meditate regularly, that’s the real way.

41:32.750 --> 41:36.333
Now, let’s see ….

41:41.750 --> 41:43.709
Patricia.

41:49.709 --> 41:54.500
She’s from a very strict ashram

41:58.917 --> 42:01.750
– of Bala the great!

42:02.291 --> 42:05.417
You are perfectly all right. You are all right.

42:10.291 --> 42:13.250
No problem.

42:32.999 --> 42:36.041
Bala is coming here, like Hanumana,

42:36.542 --> 42:39.583
to America very soon.

42:41.166 --> 42:43.542
But you see, when he starts all correcting and all that

42:43.834 --> 42:46.000
he’s all right, but then sometimes he gets so tired,

42:46.375 --> 42:49.959
then he becomes a complaint master, you know – isn’t he?

42:50.333 --> 42:52.208
So I have told him next time

42:52.583 --> 42:54.041
you don’t complain to Me about anyone,

42:54.333 --> 42:55.709
otherwise he’ll get ….

42:56.083 --> 43:00.792
… is done. All right, he’s done. Excellent!

43:16.417 --> 43:19.083
You are right, all right, come along.

43:19.458 --> 43:22.417
You are perfectly all right. Yes, now come along.

43:22.792 --> 43:25.375
If you want Me to see you again, on hand.

43:27.125 --> 43:31.208
You are perfectly all right.

43:43.625 --> 43:46.917
Very good.

44:17.667 --> 44:22.417
For trade you have to now stick onto your job, all right?

44:23.458 --> 44:25.125
It goes from right to left, right to left

44:25.417 --> 44:27.166
– that’s not good, eh?

44:27.542 --> 44:30.917
Just try My trade!

44:33.041 --> 44:35.583
May God bless you.

44:38.542 --> 44:39.959
I think, you’ll be all right.

44:40.208 --> 44:43.417
But you see, your Heart catching, all that is because,

44:43.750 --> 44:45.500
if you start changing jobs,

44:45.875 --> 44:49.709
it works on your – put your hands towards Me.

45:16.458 --> 45:20.333
You are all right, James, and despite Santa Cruz!

45:22.041 --> 45:23.000
May God bless you.

45:23.291 --> 45:24.500
I’m really very happy about it.

45:24.792 --> 45:27.333
I didn’t know you worked there in Santa Cruz.

45:27.750 --> 45:30.291
That’s something I’m very much worried about.

45:30.583 --> 45:32.125
May God bless you.

45:32.583 --> 45:33.792
I’m very happy that you are there.

45:34.083 --> 45:36.959
Something is working out.

45:37.333 --> 45:39.999
It’s good. You are very good.

45:40.291 --> 45:42.417
Santa Cruz otherwise could be –

45:42.709 --> 45:44.000
[Yogi: I should stay in Santa Cruz?]

45:44.333 --> 45:45.792
Yes, I think so, you can.

45:46.083 --> 45:49.166
Very few people can, without catching,

45:49.500 --> 45:52.208
so you’d better stay there.

45:56.667 --> 45:58.083
So may God bless you.

46:01.333 --> 46:07.125
Now, who else? So everybody has been?

47:20.583 --> 47:23.917
Very good. Excellent .…

47:48.875 --> 47:51.667
Now. Better take out the … if you can.

47:51.999 --> 47:56.083
It’s mine, all right, take it out, doesn’t matter.

48:11.834 --> 48:14.375
Better?

48:15.834 --> 48:18.709
That’s how you can treat people, you see?

48:19.041 --> 48:21.542
Ah, now. Left …

48:21.959 --> 48:25.500
left Nabhi, left Nabhi.

48:43.709 --> 48:45.041
You are all right.

48:45.375 --> 48:48.375
Hah, now, better? Better.

48:55.291 --> 48:59.041
[Yogini: Should I not wear the other rings?]

48:59.458 --> 49:02.959
Better not, because sometimes your chakras

49:03.291 --> 49:05.166
are not all right.

49:05.542 --> 49:07.417
They give a pressure ….

49:15.250 --> 49:17.792
What?

49:18.583 --> 49:21.834
Yes, that’s what is needed.

49:37.000 --> 49:41.959
Who else? Come along, come.

49:56.208 --> 49:59.000
Nabhi … Swadisthana …

50:00.291 --> 50:03.291
artistic?

50:31.250 --> 50:32.875
Hah! It’s all right.

50:33.125 --> 50:38.291
Working in the restaurant, so you can have …!

50:39.291 --> 50:42.750
She’s all right.

50:47.750 --> 50:51.625
Come along now, who else?

51:00.417 --> 51:04.291
Ah, better, isn’t it?

52:11.083 --> 52:14.083
I’m saying that you search a husband for her;

52:14.458 --> 52:17.875
because I searched yours in no time!

52:19.000 --> 52:24.291
It was such a fast thing, such a fast thing, wasn’t it?

52:56.291 --> 53:00.625
Those who tie it up put their hands like that.

53:07.875 --> 53:10.000
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah!

53:28.875 --> 53:32.250
I think you just take a photograph.

56:25.875 --> 56:31.458
So, Alex, everybody has got it? Come forward.

56:37.875 --> 56:41.500
Let’s see. Are you all right now?

56:41.875 --> 56:45.667
Better? Better now.

56:46.083 --> 56:49.000
Let it work out. That’s all right.

56:49.542 --> 56:53.959
Hah, now, is he? Left.

56:56.375 --> 56:59.709
Right to the left. Right to the left.

57:00.250 --> 57:02.250
Ah, that’s it.

57:39.041 --> 57:41.667
Hah! Done!

57:42.000 --> 57:45.000
All right?

57:49.417 --> 57:53.667
How is he? Bring him.

57:55.917 --> 57:57.875
Where’s the other baby?

57:58.166 --> 57:59.959
Where is he? Shaun.

58:00.291 --> 58:01.709
Shaun, come here.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.834
I wanted you to come and make Me wear this.

58:04.125 --> 58:06.709
You have to make – good, you’re all right now.

58:06.917 --> 58:08.542
God bless you – now, now, Shaun,

58:08.959 --> 58:11.000
you have to put this in My neck;

58:11.375 --> 58:12.583
she’s feeling shy, you see.

58:12.999 --> 58:14.542
Now, this one is not feeling shy.

58:14.959 --> 58:16.583
Now, let Me have this one.

58:16.959 --> 58:18.291
This one doesn’t feel shy.

58:18.750 --> 58:19.667
Ohoho!

58:19.959 --> 58:23.125
This one doesn’t feel shy.

58:24.792 --> 58:27.208
Oh! You are crying, so he’s also crying!

58:27.291 --> 58:30.333
He’s also …

58:32.583 --> 58:34.291
See now, they have done the puja,

58:34.667 --> 58:37.333
they have done everything for Me, you have done nothing!

58:37.834 --> 58:41.834
Shaun, you have to put some – All right,

58:42.166 --> 58:45.375
let’s – don’t disturb her, they are all sleeping.

58:47.000 --> 58:52.834
[Yogini asks about a name given previously to her child]

58:54.500 --> 58:57.500
You put it “Narasimha”, should be her name.

58:57.959 --> 59:00.041
Where was that?

59:02.917 --> 59:05.750
Narasimhini.

59:10.709 --> 59:13.750
I gave you the name!

59:16.250 --> 59:18.041
She was born – when was she born?

59:18.542 --> 59:19.458
[Yogini: On July the fifth.]

59:19.834 --> 59:23.041
Ah, that’s why, because she’s a Leo.

59:25.417 --> 59:31.125
You can give her another name also, a simple one.

59:40.709 --> 59:43.959
That’s a power of Goddess, you know.

59:44.333 --> 59:49.000
Oh! Somebody’s coming up! Ah!

01:00:04.083 --> 01:00:07.667
You can call her Kesar. Kesar.

01:00:08.083 --> 01:00:11.000
“Kesar” means “the power of the lion.”

01:00:11.458 --> 01:00:14.667
Kesar. “Kesari” is the lion,

01:00:15.041 --> 01:00:16.834
and the “Kesar” is the power of the lion;

01:00:17.166 --> 01:00:18.500
same thing as Narasimha.

01:00:18.834 --> 01:00:20.000
That’s easier, Kesar.

01:00:23.333 --> 01:00:30.625
What does she want? K-E-S-A-R. Kesar.

01:00:35.458 --> 01:00:37.375
All right.

01:00:37.625 --> 01:00:39.041
He wants to have something more.

01:00:39.375 --> 01:00:43.041
Whatever you want, Shaun, what do you want?

01:00:43.667 --> 01:00:47.667
Shaun, what do you want to have? You want to have this?

01:00:48.917 --> 01:00:51.291
Which one do you want to eat?

01:00:51.875 --> 01:00:54.917
Which one you like? You’re hungry. Whatever it is, have it.

01:00:57.667 --> 01:01:00.500
Everybody has been? Hallo.

01:01:03.875 --> 01:01:06.583
Come along, come along. What do you want?

01:01:07.375 --> 01:01:10.583
All right, all right. Let him have something there.

01:01:16.291 --> 01:01:19.458
They all like grapes.

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:32.125
There. So let’s see you. You have to bow.

01:01:33.875 --> 01:01:36.999
You – she has to still come, yes.

01:01:38.208 --> 01:01:41.458
What about you? You have, I see.

01:01:41.959 --> 01:01:43.750
So sweet.

01:01:44.125 --> 01:01:48.959
He’s shy, that’s all. He’s excellent, Shaun is excellent!

01:01:49.917 --> 01:01:53.667
Very beautiful, excellent, see now!

01:01:53.959 --> 01:01:57.417
Now slowly open the eyes. He’s a bit shy.

01:02:49.709 --> 01:02:51.458
[Yogis: Butter.]

01:02:51.917 --> 01:02:55.375
You made it? You made it here?

01:02:55.875 --> 01:02:59.500
Really? It’s great!

01:03:02.583 --> 01:03:07.583
Now, take it, it’s all right. Good. May God bless you.

01:03:08.291 --> 01:03:11.583
Come along, now let Me see.

01:03:14.083 --> 01:03:17.542
Are you all right now? Not yet?

01:03:19.583 --> 01:03:22.000
I think you sit more comfortably.

01:03:22.458 --> 01:03:24.999
You’re very tired.

01:03:25.917 --> 01:03:28.709
Be comfortable, that’s important. And now let’s see.

01:03:28.999 --> 01:03:33.166
What’s the matter? His left side is so tired today.

01:03:35.834 --> 01:03:38.583
Left Agnya is still there.

01:03:39.417 --> 01:03:42.375
And right Swadisthana, Heart … chakras.

01:03:42.959 --> 01:03:45.792
Now come along.

01:04:01.709 --> 01:04:06.000
David, you put this light on his back.

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:10.417
Here. And now you put both your hands towards Me like this.

01:04:10.834 --> 01:04:12.917
The light you take it in your hand, that one, that one.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:15.500
The one that is before you.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.917
Now, she’s all right. She’s all right.

01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:23.458
You’re all right. May God bless you.

01:04:23.999 --> 01:04:26.999
You are all right. Now, who else is left?

01:04:30.834 --> 01:04:34.458
In Marathi also we say “I” is “me”, “I”.

01:04:52.625 --> 01:04:59.750
Better? Now – it will work out.

01:05:02.041 --> 01:05:03.709
[Yogi: Shri Lalita.]

01:05:04.083 --> 01:05:06.041
It’s catching.

01:05:06.458 --> 01:05:10.125
Put right hand on the Mother Earth.

01:05:10.834 --> 01:05:17.750
Hah! She’s all right. You are all right. May God bless you.

01:05:18.583 --> 01:05:21.917
Come.

01:05:25.999 --> 01:05:27.583
Now you grow up fast;

01:05:27.959 --> 01:05:30.917
you have to give realization!

01:05:38.959 --> 01:05:41.709
Hah! All right. She’s all right.

01:05:42.125 --> 01:05:44.959
You are all right.

01:05:45.834 --> 01:05:48.750
You come along now. You have been.

01:05:49.125 --> 01:05:52.583
All of you? Now, right.

01:06:14.959 --> 01:06:17.999
Heart.

01:06:18.917 --> 01:06:20.959
Right Swadisthan.

01:06:22.458 --> 01:06:24.375
Left Swadisthan.

01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:26.458
Heart.

01:06:26.917 --> 01:06:29.375
Both sides.

01:06:29.959 --> 01:06:32.917
Heart.

01:06:45.333 --> 01:06:48.709
Combination is funny – left, right Swadisthan and Heart;

01:06:49.125 --> 01:06:51.417
center Heart now.

01:06:51.917 --> 01:06:54.250
[Marathi]

01:06:54.709 --> 01:06:57.375
Hah!

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:04.125
Hold your breath.

01:07:07.792 --> 01:07:11.291
Do like that, do like that.

01:07:12.417 --> 01:07:16.000
Hah! Better?

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:19.583
Better now.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.291
Now better.

01:07:21.667 --> 01:07:23.041
Better, but she has to work.

01:07:23.458 --> 01:07:25.417
Hallo!

01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:27.999
Work it out, because a funny combination:

01:07:28.333 --> 01:07:34.000
left Swadisthan, right Swadisthan, Heart, and Sahasrara.

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:38.750
E-G-O.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.542
As simple as that.

01:07:50.875 --> 01:07:53.959
Rub My foot, right? Still.

01:08:04.834 --> 01:08:07.208
Now, what you do is to put your right hand towards Me,

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:09.208
left hand up. Let’s see, one by one.

01:08:09.583 --> 01:08:12.083
Are you better now?

01:08:12.542 --> 01:08:14.667
Still the left is catching.

01:08:15.166 --> 01:08:17.792
Why don’t you both get some lemon and chillies?

01:08:18.125 --> 01:08:21.542
Would be a good idea.

01:08:22.375 --> 01:08:24.083
What have you been doing?

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.458
Have you been – I don’t know what you have been doing.

01:08:27.792 --> 01:08:30.875
I just don’t understand.

01:08:36.458 --> 01:08:42.625
You had right side, but this left you didn’t have it.

01:08:43.917 --> 01:08:45.875
Left Nabhi.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:49.875
Very hectic liver.

01:08:50.583 --> 01:08:52.959
That way you’re much better.

01:08:53.417 --> 01:08:56.959
Left Nabhi’s all right, but left Swadisthana.

01:08:57.667 --> 01:09:00.917
That is your psychology.

01:09:01.834 --> 01:09:05.000
Do you meditate?

01:09:18.417 --> 01:09:21.417
You see, I just thought that right-sidedness

01:09:21.834 --> 01:09:26.542
could be down in a place where it is quieter,

01:09:27.875 --> 01:09:31.208
so that your speed at least should come down first of all.

01:09:32.041 --> 01:09:34.458
And then it will be all right.

01:09:38.458 --> 01:09:41.542
Just put down your speed.

01:09:42.875 --> 01:09:45.208
“I don’t do anything,” you should say.

01:09:45.667 --> 01:09:49.333
All right? Put it everything into the hands of God.

01:09:50.250 --> 01:09:52.542
Still there?

01:09:52.999 --> 01:09:55.792
Better now.

01:09:59.375 --> 01:10:03.041
It’s very surprising.

01:10:10.917 --> 01:10:16.041
What’s that? A gift? That’s all right. Thank you.

01:10:17.291 --> 01:10:21.000
What’s this – two? Two things not allowed!

01:10:23.291 --> 01:10:26.834
What’s that?

01:10:30.417 --> 01:10:33.959
I did not see the gift!

01:10:36.875 --> 01:10:41.709
That is his trick, I tell you: I was buying it, and he bought it!

01:10:43.583 --> 01:10:51.375
Oh, it’s beautiful. So we quarreled for quite some time.

01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:55.875
It’s not easy to win over Mr. Danny!

01:10:57.917 --> 01:11:00.250
But this one is a trick you played.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.999
This one is, this is not. This one was tricky.

01:11:07.125 --> 01:11:10.625
For the other two is all right, but this one was tricky.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.750
It’s a beautiful piece, though, isn’t it?

01:11:20.875 --> 01:11:23.583
These are magnets?

01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:28.917
Beautiful. Very good.

01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:36.999
We should get a suitcase

01:11:37.291 --> 01:11:40.583
where you can keep all these things, in several boxes.

01:11:53.792 --> 01:11:57.125
You see, in that if you put this ….

01:12:01.125 --> 01:12:04.500
No, he was saying, doctor was saying he has got a box

01:12:04.917 --> 01:12:08.667
which he’ll vacate it.

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:13.458
But so far they have not telephoned, these people.

01:12:14.333 --> 01:12:16.625
Ah, he is worried on that.

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:20.834
All right now. Better? Are you better?

01:12:27.834 --> 01:12:30.709
I think first the financial situation should improve,

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:32.250
then you’ll be all right.

01:12:32.625 --> 01:12:33.959
I think if you really go to Mexico,

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:36.083
that would make some money also.

01:12:36.542 --> 01:12:38.917
And she is also very clever.

01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:41.999
May God bless you.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:47.208
But to establish, how will they do it, suddenly?

01:12:48.250 --> 01:12:49.959
They have to ask the government here

01:12:50.375 --> 01:12:52.583
to employ them, or something.

01:13:06.625 --> 01:13:09.208
But there is no job problem there.

01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:18.375
All right.

01:13:18.834 --> 01:13:23.667
That’s a good idea. May God bless you.

01:13:24.041 --> 01:13:26.875
I don’t know how also his boss is.

01:13:27.208 --> 01:13:29.458
Might be he’s caught up with his boss, or something.

01:13:29.834 --> 01:13:31.333
How is he? [Yogi: Terrible, Mother.]

01:13:31.667 --> 01:13:33.999
Ah, that’s it. [Yogi: Garam’s uncle.]

01:13:34.375 --> 01:13:40.333
Because you are not so bad. I know. I heard.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.834
Must be, must be him.

01:13:47.125 --> 01:13:48.125
So better change him now.

01:13:48.417 --> 01:13:50.792
As he says, they can find out something for you.

01:13:51.166 --> 01:13:54.208
Better try.

01:13:55.375 --> 01:13:58.166
Because that will bring down her speed also, I think,

01:13:58.625 --> 01:14:03.625
because your country is very, moving slowly, yes.

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:06.583
It’s a very speedy place also;

01:14:06.999 --> 01:14:09.875
America’s extremely speedy.

01:14:10.542 --> 01:14:12.250
Those who have no speed can come here,

01:14:12.667 --> 01:14:16.417
but those who have speed should get out of this place.

01:14:17.166 --> 01:14:18.959
At first I thought it would be nice if you go to New York,

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:24.333
but New York is no less, and that won’t suit.

01:14:24.792 --> 01:14:28.041
So if it could be arranged in Mexico, nothing like.

01:14:28.667 --> 01:14:30.709
Once they are all right then there’s no problem,

01:14:31.083 --> 01:14:35.250
once they are balanced; but both are caught up.

01:14:36.375 --> 01:14:38.500
And they are good people there, they’re nice,

01:14:38.875 --> 01:14:41.834
they’re not horrible people in that country.

01:14:42.375 --> 01:14:45.500
Except for this black magic they do,

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.083
which can be corrected.

01:14:47.458 --> 01:14:49.667
Slowly they’ll be all right.

01:14:51.125 --> 01:14:55.000
Things are so much cheaper there, so much cheaper ….

01:15:00.834 --> 01:15:03.458
Handmade, yes, that’s also a good thing,

01:15:03.875 --> 01:15:05.875
compared to machinery.

01:15:06.291 --> 01:15:08.291
So all right, thank you very much. May God bless you.

01:15:08.667 --> 01:15:10.750
Thank you for the purse. May God bless you.

01:15:28.291 --> 01:15:29.959
Now as you have given Me purse,

01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:33.417
you must have lots of money here!

01:15:34.417 --> 01:15:36.333
In this ashram you must get lots of money.

01:15:37.083 --> 01:15:40.999
So far, nobody gave Me a purse, for your information.

01:15:41.875 --> 01:15:43.792
This is the first time.

01:15:44.583 --> 01:15:48.417
[Yogi: For auspiciousness we should have put a dollar in.]

01:15:48.959 --> 01:15:51.000
Ah, it’s a good idea – one dollar, then.

01:15:59.542 --> 01:16:03.125
Five dollar is too much. One dollar.

01:16:07.083 --> 01:16:12.250
No, no, no, no. This is the puja money?

01:16:13.125 --> 01:16:16.000
So this you give it in the general puja there,

01:16:16.583 --> 01:16:18.041
when they have it, eh?

01:16:18.583 --> 01:16:21.875
Now I have got this purse, that’s all.

01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:25.458
You don’t have one dollar, isn’t it?

01:16:25.875 --> 01:16:27.208
All right.

01:16:36.542 --> 01:16:39.291
But he’s given twenty-one now.

01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:41.250
He’s another difficult person!

01:16:41.667 --> 01:16:42.999
All right. Now what I’m saying,

01:16:43.417 --> 01:16:45.291
that this puja money whatever you’ve got,

01:16:45.834 --> 01:16:49.000
you count it and put it in a packet,

01:16:49.542 --> 01:16:52.542
give it to Me in the general puja money,

01:16:52.999 --> 01:16:55.792
but from your side – all right?

01:16:56.250 --> 01:16:58.166
So for the real puja it’s going to be there.

01:16:58.542 --> 01:17:01.375
It’s of course a real puja too, today, it was a great puja,

01:17:01.834 --> 01:17:04.041
but the Krishna Puja we are going to have there.

01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:06.917
So thank you very much, it’s rather smart for Me.

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:12.333
Very good.

01:17:14.083 --> 01:17:17.417
This time, you know, four forces I have got, luckily.

01:17:30.792 --> 01:17:36.000
We must give a bandhan to that gentleman.
