1
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,190
Would you like a drink, Shri Mataji?

2
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:35,420
Diet Coke.

3
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:55,062
So we are with the nature here. So beautiful!

4
00:01:06,508 --> 00:01:12,272
The way it is planned you can see how the person who has planned it had the feel of the land,

5
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,552
feel of the nature.

6
00:01:14,552 --> 00:01:20,862
How he has made up, by not destroying it.

7
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,144
Whatever is there he used it,

8
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:28,822
otherwise they would have put one
bulldozer and finished it off.

9
00:01:31,432 --> 00:01:37,822
The way it is planned shows he had
feeling for the land and he could understand.

10
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:44,073
The way we look at nature also, is our own.

11
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:46,596
The way we are inside, that’s how we look at nature.

12
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:51,785
Nature is our friend absolutely;
it's working for us all the time.

13
00:01:52,694 --> 00:01:55,194
And we don’t do much for it.

14
00:01:57,272 --> 00:02:01,792
Look at these trees.

15
00:02:01,782 --> 00:02:05,902
They give shade, they give fruits.

16
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,045
Whatever is possible for them, they do it.

17
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:15,575
And when they are old, we use them for wood.

18
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,845
All supportive to our life.

19
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:29,732
But we must have feeling; otherwise, what’s happening today is this ecological problem.

20
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:44,933
And this is because we do not have
any feeling for the Mother Earth.

21
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:47,447
No feeling for the nature.

22
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:54,749
We are really plundering her
and then the whole thing reacts.

23
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:09,784
It's a kind of an aggression that

24
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:13,634
you want to have so many
things at the same time.

25
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:20,482
Like I have seen once, first
when we went to England,

26
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:31,126
we never served any drinks in our house in India, but in England nobody would come to your house, so we had to organise.

27
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,126
I told C.P. that “You better
do something about it.”

28
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,633
So he went and bought some
books, how to organise.

29
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:46,542
So first the question of tumblers.

30
00:03:46,542 --> 00:03:50,963
And so many types of tumblers you had to use.

31
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:57,415
I mean in those days, this was I’m telling
you, 1973, or say beginning of ’74.

32
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:08,044
The first lot we had to get cost us
nine thousand pounds. First total.

33
00:04:08,044 --> 00:04:13,391
But we had to get about twenty-four of
the best crystal, the best crystal.

34
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:24,576
Because for everything there's a different
type of a crystal that you have to have.

35
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:30,216
I just thought that if you had some
silver, it would be much better.

36
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:37,890
 One glass of silver is sufficient, once for all your lifetime, your children’s lifetime.

37
00:04:37,896 --> 00:04:41,147
Instead of that, all these things like crystal.

38
00:04:41,146 --> 00:04:47,546
But at least it was crystal, it was all right
because it was in a way, some sort of an art.

39
00:04:50,494 --> 00:04:59,093
And then I learnt how they make, even in England, etching and all that. Beautiful in Scotland!

40
00:04:59,114 --> 00:05:03,663
English crystal also is nice.
The best is Czechoslovakian.

41
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:12,467
All these things I learnt there with
that horrible sets of tumblers

42
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:20,192
and you had to have the best quality,

43
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:27,052
that’s something, part of the prestige, you see.

44
00:05:27,073 --> 00:05:32,382
So somebody will come and just
see the glass,

45
00:05:35,672 --> 00:05:37,623
slowly, you see.

46
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:42,854
And the plates also, they’ll
come and just turn round.

47
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:45,404
First I didn’t know what was happening.

48
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:48,654
Because that’s not done in India,
I mean nobody’s bothered, you see.

49
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:53,064
Only if there’s art they will appreciate, finished.

50
00:05:53,074 --> 00:05:58,452
We don’t have Saville Rows and all
that in India, so it's different.

51
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:07,922
And that’s what I felt, that so many
tumblers are needed for one household.

52
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:16,806
So, they are spending so much
money to buy all these varieties.

53
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,936
But the worst is in America and
now they’re suffering from it.

54
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:27,455
Even in plastic they have varieties.

55
00:06:29,547 --> 00:06:32,926
So you go to somebody’s house, so they…

56
00:06:55,372 --> 00:07:06,153
So even in plastic they would, say, they have plastic tumblers which are just usable once.

57
00:07:06,153 --> 00:07:10,433
So they use once that, then it’s thrown out.

58
00:07:10,451 --> 00:07:15,503
Even in the drawing room, in a, say, restaurant or anything,

59
00:07:15,524 --> 00:07:17,656
even in their own drawing
rooms they have plastics.

60
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:19,529
Can you imagine?

61
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:24,909
And then they will use a lot
of paper, plastic things.

62
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:27,409
They never have proper plates.

63
00:07:28,619 --> 00:07:31,537
They may be very rich but they
are always on the picnic,

64
00:07:31,557 --> 00:07:38,897
you see, eating with the paper
plates, using plastic things.

65
00:07:38,897 --> 00:07:42,007
But they are so proud of it.

66
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:47,197
You see, this is a new on that has come now in the plastic scene.

67
00:07:49,357 --> 00:07:52,902
But what is so great about
this? It's after all plastic.

68
00:07:52,922 --> 00:07:56,392
It's new, you see, new.  New is the idea.

69
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:02,934
Then everything has to be different. Every year.

70
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:05,457
So this is the fashion this
year, so this kind of clothes

71
00:08:26,642 --> 00:08:32,732
Now they go on discarding this plastic
that they use, then dresses also.

72
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:36,032
This is the fashion in Paris,
so that’s the dress comes in.

73
00:08:37,002 --> 00:08:41,702
Then the entrepreneurs have really
made us slaves out of that.

74
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:49,982
Now, if you are dressed differently they say,
“Oh, you are out of fashions, out of date.”

75
00:08:49,982 --> 00:08:52,957
So one lady came to see Me.

76
00:08:52,978 --> 00:09:03,238
She had pants cut here, here, jeans
you see cut here, there, everywhere.

77
00:09:03,248 --> 00:09:07,656
I was just worried that if
she sits on, may give way.

78
00:09:07,656 --> 00:09:09,976
The way it was cut.

79
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:16,536
And a funny type of a shirt with all cuttings
everywhere, all the threads coming out.

80
00:09:17,644 --> 00:09:21,444
So I said, "Why are you dressed up like this?"

81
00:09:21,452 --> 00:09:23,952
"I'm up to date."

82
00:09:33,752 --> 00:09:39,226
So I asked her, "What about
Me?" "You're antique!"

83
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:45,297
I said, "Antique is more
precious that up- to-date."

84
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:56,984
So in India, we say that these people
have got now the desire to be beggars.

85
00:09:57,015 --> 00:09:58,654
With everything beggarish!

86
00:09:58,654 --> 00:10:05,435
The houses are beggarish, dresses are
beggarish, the hair are beggarish.

87
00:10:05,414 --> 00:10:07,914
To add up to it, drugs have come,

88
00:10:07,914 --> 00:10:17,421
so it’s all absolutely… you feel you are
in some sort of a fish market, smelling.

89
00:10:17,428 --> 00:10:22,091
The way people live is… I mean, they
are no way better than our slumming,

90
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:26,721
the way they live, the way
they eat, the way they like.

91
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:30,224
They have money, not that
they don’t have money.

92
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:33,934
Well they probably pay lots of money
for the clothes with the cuts in.

93
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:38,603
Oh, they pay more for that. They pay more.

94
00:10:38,607 --> 00:10:44,683
But you go to any house you
see, England is worse this way,

95
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:51,456
and when I was searching for a house,
we had to go from places to places.

96
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:53,976
Quite big houses we were looking out for.

97
00:10:55,382 --> 00:11:01,426
Suddenly, you find two legs of
pants falling on you from somewhere,

98
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:03,726
and then some shirts
coming on your faces.

99
00:11:03,726 --> 00:11:05,786
I said, "What's this?"

100
00:11:05,796 --> 00:11:09,004
"Oh, these are old clothes we have, you see."

101
00:11:09,896 --> 00:11:10,854
"Since long?"

102
00:11:10,854 --> 00:11:13,354
"Oh no! This was last year's."

103
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,512
"Why are you keeping them?"

104
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,032
"What to do?"

105
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:24,822
"You better throw them away. It's
no good, give it away to someone."

106
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:29,956
"No, we are keeping them. Maybe
the fashion might come back."

107
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:33,486
Piles and piles and piles.

108
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:39,853
You get into a room and suddenly
you are on a pile of dirty clothes.

109
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:42,362
So untidy! So horribly lousy!

110
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:47,642
This is advancement.

111
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:50,135
This is what we have progressed.

112
00:11:50,441 --> 00:11:55,707
So this funny greed of having
more and more and more and more,

113
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,007
I mean, you can have, but
have something artistic

114
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,344
so you won’t have too many
things, you’ll have few.

115
00:12:02,344 --> 00:12:06,550
If you try to have artistic things,
then you will have some few things.

116
00:12:06,548 --> 00:12:09,048
 But if you want to buy
plastic, there’s no end to it.

117
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:22,413
The clothes are all artificial these days
and in that the fashions are changing.

118
00:12:22,414 --> 00:12:27,584
So we should not be slave of these entrepreneurs
who are just befooling us all the time.

119
00:12:27,591 --> 00:12:30,091
In the market something comes up funny,

120
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:34,413
transparent clothes, you see, made of plastic.

121
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:40,673
Something absurd, you know sometimes
the clothes are very absurd.

122
00:12:40,673 --> 00:12:44,173
Like they had very tight
jeans once upon a time.

123
00:12:44,174 --> 00:12:48,775
And they tighten it by … they said
that you wear it and get into the tub.

124
00:12:48,775 --> 00:12:51,525
And when you come out they
just stick to your body.

125
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:54,035
And then you bathe with it all the time.

126
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:57,745
I don’t know if they bathe
also, that’s another point.

127
00:12:57,745 --> 00:13:02,115
Now, it’s such a funny
thing that with this,

128
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:06,003
the ladies couldn’t get into the buses
so they were to be pushed in you see.

129
00:13:12,871 --> 00:13:16,861
But the worst was that they
developed varicose veins.

130
00:13:19,752 --> 00:13:23,270
So they would come to Me.
I said, “Why did you wear?”

131
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,940
So that was the fashion. Then
they started with the baggy ones,

132
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,350
with the holes, holy pants.

133
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:36,798
Like that, you see, moving from one to
another, having too many things of no value.

134
00:13:36,798 --> 00:13:42,614
So the Sahaja yogis should understand
that we are friends of the nature.

135
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:47,170
And whatever nature gives
us, we have to respect it.

136
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:49,696
Better wear natural clothes as far as possible.

137
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:59,865
One natural shirt is better
than three unnatural ones,

138
00:13:59,865 --> 00:14:05,139
because you can breathe better, your skin
breathes better, you can wash it better.

139
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:07,926
So best is to take to more natural things.

140
00:14:07,926 --> 00:14:13,211
I think this trend is coming up,
and that’s a very good trend,

141
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:16,456
that we should take to natural things.

142
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:23,131
And when we take to natural things, there’s
one thing we cannot have too many of it.

143
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:30,127
But if you start using something
plastic, then there can be any number

144
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:34,653
and that's how you really
torture the Mother Earth.

145
00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:37,153
First of all, you dig her out.

146
00:14:37,153 --> 00:14:40,521
Then you wear all these things.

147
00:14:40,586 --> 00:14:43,558
And they cannot be destroyed.

148
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:46,072
There are mountains and mountains!

149
00:14:46,072 --> 00:14:50,251
Mountains and mountains of this
plastic if you go in America.

150
00:14:50,243 --> 00:14:55,158
Even in England I’ve seen
mountains, such a filthy sight.

151
00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:00,278
They can’t burn it. If you
put it in the sea, it floats.

152
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:09,682
And wherever you go near all these so - called very big cities,

153
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:18,779
 if you see the sea from the aeroplane
you find all littered up completely.

154
00:15:18,786 --> 00:15:27,278
So we are spoiling our beaches, we are
spoiling our homes and wasting our money.

155
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:33,930
So these entrepreneurs have
no feelings for the nature.

156
00:15:35,246 --> 00:15:38,596
They never think what nature is like.

157
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:45,146
When I wanted to build this Pratishthan,

158
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:50,938
the five six architects from
India (they’re Sahaja yogis also)

159
00:15:50,947 --> 00:15:54,918
very well qualified but in
the Western manner, you know.

160
00:15:56,616 --> 00:16:07,811
 So the design they made was some sort of a colonial style house with a platform all along

161
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:10,871
because the land was like this, you see.

162
00:16:10,884 --> 00:16:15,811
So they took the zero point as the highest.

163
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:21,212
So you hang on a platform, for which
you have to pay enormous amount.

164
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:28,162
I said, " All the way we have not come
to this place to hang in the air.

165
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:30,506
They couldn't understand
what I was talking to them.

166
00:16:30,508 --> 00:16:33,008
I said, "I want to stick to the ground

167
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:35,508
I'll build the house on the ground."

168
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:41,237
They said, "You have to make a topography,
you have to make this 'graphy,' that 'graphy.'

169
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:46,167
"This is very simple. What is this
'graphies' you are making? Just get to it.

170
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:52,048
Luckily, they had gone all of them
on leave for about fifteen days.

171
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:54,548
I changed the whole lot.

172
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:59,331
And we would have been
hanging on twenty-two feet high.

173
00:17:00,377 --> 00:17:08,468
So I put one hall underneath that.

174
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:14,108
And when you are moving down, you never
feel that you are going down that low.

175
00:17:15,348 --> 00:17:21,421
And it’s the personality of the nature
which is expressed in that house.

176
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,920
It’s very interesting.

177
00:17:23,935 --> 00:17:26,601
You have seen Pratishthan?

178
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:29,115
You see, did you feel that
you are going too much down?

179
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:30,878
Nobody feels that way.

180
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:33,398
You don't actually feel
you are going down at all.

181
00:17:35,185 --> 00:17:37,118
Well it is.

182
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,984
but after fifteen days they returned.

183
00:17:40,983 --> 00:17:42,443
All go!

184
00:17:42,463 --> 00:17:43,513
"What?"

185
00:17:43,533 --> 00:17:44,864
"How?"

186
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:49,394
It's going to happen." I said, "Nothing
going to happen, take it from Me."

187
00:17:49,378 --> 00:17:55,152
I’ve used it the best way one has to use and
nothing is going to happen to your building

188
00:17:55,176 --> 00:17:56,402
And they were after the builder.

189
00:17:56,402 --> 00:18:00,142
The builder said, "Shri Mataji
praised me, so I'm not bothered."

190
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:05,824
And it all worked out so well. So well!

191
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:11,374
So this is what it is in the...
it's also labour saving, you see.

192
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:15,242
If you ask somebody, “Why
do you wear plastic?”

193
00:18:15,255 --> 00:18:19,534
they say, “You don’t have to press it.”

194
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:22,035
But what’s the harm in pressing?

195
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:28,894
You see there’s one cloth if you have to press it’s all right, it’s a good idea, or don’t press.

196
00:18:28,894 --> 00:18:33,826
Don’t want to press, don’t press,
you’ll look quite neat, doesn’t matter.

197
00:18:33,823 --> 00:18:41,423
But what is the need, I don’t
understand, to have so many plastics?

198
00:18:41,422 --> 00:18:46,009
So Sahaja yogis should avoid
plastic things as far as possible,

199
00:18:45,995 --> 00:18:53,102
especially for children, one should be
careful not to make them wear plastics.

200
00:18:58,739 --> 00:19:01,000
All of them are here, isn't it?

201
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:03,509
A gathering of the clans Mother!

202
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,162
They must be going home.

203
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:10,372
Either they are having a birthday
party... or must be doing a training exercise.

204
00:19:10,386 --> 00:19:12,886
Or celebrating some rescue work.

205
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:18,826
Why! Look at that (unclear)

206
00:19:26,724 --> 00:19:32,864
What about plastic toys for the
children? Is that a bad thing?

207
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:37,976
Not very good for them.

208
00:19:37,984 --> 00:19:44,126
Also these plastic napkins you
use for children are not necessary

209
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:49,616
Then you see, you become unattentive
to children also with that.

210
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:58,217
I mean, toys they play for a while but still
sometimes they put it in the mouth and…

211
00:20:05,077 --> 00:20:13,063
If you see, children are more fond of things
made out of cloth or made out of wood.

212
00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:16,683
They like it. They like the feel of it.

213
00:20:16,678 --> 00:20:26,348
You put five plastic things and one thing made out of wood or made out of cloth, they’ll pick up the cloth one.

214
00:20:26,348 --> 00:20:28,848
They like the feel of the
smoothness of it, you see.

215
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:37,225
They’re very expensive here, I agree,
but in India they’re very cheap.

216
00:20:37,225 --> 00:20:40,345
This time in Madras I don’t know
if you picked up something or not,

217
00:20:40,345 --> 00:20:44,035
lots of things were there for sale for children.

218
00:20:46,115 --> 00:20:51,755
You see, they wouldn’t stop My car anywhere, I was on the run, otherwise I would have bought.

219
00:20:51,754 --> 00:20:58,059
The wooden toys for girls are very good in India. Beautiful!

220
00:20:58,069 --> 00:21:00,569
Also for boys!

221
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,787
But the plastic toys which are
covered with cloth are all right.

222
00:21:06,801 --> 00:21:09,301
Not so dangerous!

223
00:21:15,902 --> 00:21:19,894
Plastic is something that
penetrates into everything.

224
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,403
Into everything!

225
00:21:24,663 --> 00:21:27,163
We also give too many toys to our children.

226
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:34,223
In our days, a girl would have
only one doll or two dolls now.

227
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:38,494
But now the plastic toys,

228
00:21:38,494 --> 00:21:45,034
the whole room is filled with it, I mean you have to just wade through to find out your child in all this.

229
00:21:45,015 --> 00:21:46,655
So many toys!

230
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:52,145
Perhaps maybe we avoid having
relationship with our children.

231
00:21:54,285 --> 00:22:00,003
We don’t talk to them, we have no time, so give them some toys, stop them, there.

232
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:03,732
Sort of a diversion.

233
00:22:03,732 --> 00:22:06,672
And that’s how we don’t
know our children at all.

234
00:22:07,832 --> 00:22:09,002
Too many toys.

235
00:22:09,001 --> 00:22:14,021
And the toys also now are coming out

236
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:18,731
in such a way that’s another slavery because
on the television they’ll advertise it.

237
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:21,991
Your children will be after
you, "I want that toy."

238
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:31,350
There was a bear, they took it
out, which had a birth date.

239
00:22:31,348 --> 00:22:44,537
And so they would celebrate the birthday and all the bears were invited you see, for that.

240
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:52,223
It’s so funny, isn’t it, that
children should be given such ideas?

241
00:22:52,223 --> 00:22:59,506
Because there’s no rapport. If the parents have a rapport with children, children won’t need so much.

242
00:22:59,522 --> 00:23:06,213
You must read some proper stories to
be told to children, talk to them.

243
00:23:06,221 --> 00:23:11,588
If you keep company with them, I don’t
think they’ll ask for toys, too many toys.

244
00:23:11,588 --> 00:23:13,148
They would not.

245
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:16,628
They’ll be very satisfied, because
most of them are realised souls.

246
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:25,242
 So talk to them in such a manner that they develop their spirituality rather than all these materialistic things.

247
00:23:28,513 --> 00:23:33,292
I have found that we don’t spend
much time with our children.

248
00:23:33,302 --> 00:23:35,492
That’s why they are like this.

249
00:23:35,502 --> 00:23:41,552
We had such a problem. I was telling you about these wise children we had in our school there.

250
00:23:41,547 --> 00:23:44,840
The teachers were mad. They
didn’t know what to do.

251
00:23:44,838 --> 00:23:47,338
They said, "Within one month's
time, we will give up."

252
00:23:47,338 --> 00:23:50,730
They said, "We can't do this any more."

253
00:23:52,229 --> 00:24:04,122
The relationship between the child and parents
should be very sensible and of respect.

254
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:12,791
Because I have seen that children go on asking questions, “Why? Why?” like that.

255
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,300
You see, it’s kind of an
aggressive nature, that’s all.

256
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,480
They don’t want to know anything.
Just go on asking questions.

257
00:24:19,483 --> 00:24:25,779
At that time you have to tell them, “You are not to know this. There’s no need for you to know.”

258
00:24:25,774 --> 00:24:28,274
You have to shut them.

259
00:24:28,274 --> 00:24:34,259
The quieter child is much
better, who observes, who learns.

260
00:24:34,257 --> 00:24:40,496
But the one who is aggressive becomes
later on a very wild personality.

261
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:43,556
So to see that your child is not aggressive.

262
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:47,823
They are exhausting. These
children are absolutely exhausting.

263
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:51,026
This time I went to Rome.

264
00:24:53,977 --> 00:24:58,876
And I bought some sweets for them.

265
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:01,736
Some chocolates.

266
00:25:01,756 --> 00:25:10,546
So when I sat down I said, "Now these
children, some lollipops and chocolates."

267
00:25:11,836 --> 00:25:14,680
So they all rushed on to Me,

268
00:25:14,676 --> 00:25:18,090
pushing their hands like this.

269
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,453
I said, "This is not to be done, you
are not beggars. Are you beggars?"

270
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,553
Then they sat back.

271
00:25:23,553 --> 00:25:25,363
They are not beggars.

272
00:25:25,353 --> 00:25:29,452
But say in India you try this, no
child will push forward this way.

273
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:33,192
 If you try to give he’ll feel
shy, he’ll look at the mother.

274
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:43,102
Should he take it or not? But this comes only
because of the rapport we have with children.

275
00:25:43,098 --> 00:25:45,932
Now how do we have rapport with them?

276
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:55,886
See now, you take them to the nature
here and see them, how they behave,

277
00:25:55,886 --> 00:25:58,916
what is their style,

278
00:25:58,936 --> 00:26:02,117
what is their treatment?

279
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,877
 Instead of making them
run about like mad

280
00:26:06,891 --> 00:26:12,337
or taking out some flowers or doing
some sort of an aggressive act,

281
00:26:12,357 --> 00:26:15,477
just make them sit down. Tell
them, “Now what is this flower?

282
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,991
Do you know the name of this flower?

283
00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:20,999
Now this one, do you know what that flower is?"

284
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:26,769
I mean many parents don't know themselves.
I don't know if they can explain.

285
00:26:26,776 --> 00:26:28,959
Then, "What is this tree?"

286
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,861
Look at the nature.

287
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:34,881
Put the attention of the
children on to something

288
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:41,331
 which will make them more
contented and more deeper.

289
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:45,449
Instead of that, as soon as they see
the space they just start running.

290
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:47,599
You don’t know what to do with them.

291
00:26:47,613 --> 00:26:53,459
It is because you have not taught them how to be concentrated on something very interesting.

292
00:26:53,459 --> 00:26:57,406
Now see, I am sitting here. I am
sitting watching these stones.

293
00:26:57,425 --> 00:26:59,306
Even this will be in My head.

294
00:26:59,315 --> 00:27:03,286
See what a beautiful fibre,
just see, just see. Beautiful!

295
00:27:03,283 --> 00:27:04,626
This is nature.

296
00:27:04,626 --> 00:27:10,846
And if once children start appreciating
it, their attention will be more on this

297
00:27:10,873 --> 00:27:13,373
than on something
nonsensical, you see.

298
00:27:27,817 --> 00:27:34,585
So a rapport needs to be established
and an understanding of the children.

299
00:27:34,607 --> 00:27:37,107
An appreciation. When they do something good,

300
00:27:37,107 --> 00:27:38,795
you must appreciate.

301
00:27:38,795 --> 00:27:43,365
And when they are doing something, mostly they
do wrong things just to attract your attention.

302
00:27:43,365 --> 00:27:50,475
If you don’t pay any attention to that and just distract their attention, to something else, it’s very easy.

303
00:27:50,475 --> 00:27:57,035
For example, now if you are going to somebody’s
house, the children are going with us;

304
00:27:57,032 --> 00:28:01,552
before going we tell them, “See now,
you have to behave there properly,

305
00:28:01,552 --> 00:28:05,302
otherwise they’ll think that
your parents are no good.

306
00:28:05,312 --> 00:28:11,578
Now we go there. You should not,
in no way try to misbehave.

307
00:28:11,578 --> 00:28:14,431
Shouldn't ask for anything. Just keep quiet."

308
00:28:14,428 --> 00:28:17,991
So first of all, you tell them how to behave.

309
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:22,905
Now when they go there and they behave properly
when you come back, you have to tell them,

310
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:27,475
“This is tremendous. You have been so good.

311
00:28:27,492 --> 00:28:30,325
You behaved so well, it's really very good.

312
00:28:30,325 --> 00:28:34,395
I'm so proud of you. So next time even better.

313
00:28:37,598 --> 00:28:42,838
Then you have to tell them about
their dignity,

314
00:28:42,842 --> 00:28:46,408
about what they are.

315
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:49,278
And also the dignity of the nature.

316
00:28:49,283 --> 00:28:52,402
“See how dignified the tree is.

317
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:55,492
How it is standing there for giving a shade.”

318
00:28:55,502 --> 00:28:57,882
 So they develop that feeling within them.

319
00:28:57,882 --> 00:29:06,524
If you do not have feeling for the nature, you cannot stop these ecological problems.

320
00:29:06,524 --> 00:29:09,024
That's important, very important.

321
00:29:11,784 --> 00:29:17,401
Luckily, with Sahaja Yoga,
Hamid has done some research

322
00:29:17,396 --> 00:29:23,565
and he has worked on the trees near Austria.

323
00:29:23,588 --> 00:29:34,924
There’s a very beautiful mountainous area, much higher than this, between Germany and Austria.

324
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:39,503
There used to be some sort
of wasps, were really fatal.

325
00:29:39,516 --> 00:29:50,046
 Now they have all disappeared and the trees are crumbling down with this acid rain and getting completely destroyed.

326
00:29:50,061 --> 00:29:52,561
So the government asked him to
do some experiment with them.

327
00:29:54,181 --> 00:30:02,934
So, he took My vibrated water in a puja and he mixed it with other water, put it everywhere.

328
00:30:02,949 --> 00:30:11,342
So he said, “All the trees about
sixty years of age didn’t react much.

329
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:21,201
 But below that, they all reacted
and they started looking healthier.”

330
00:30:21,213 --> 00:30:23,713
But he said still, the speed was not there.

331
00:30:23,713 --> 00:30:30,286
So there were lots of these badges from America left over

332
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:34,196
So he went and pushed them into every tree.

333
00:30:34,196 --> 00:30:38,896
And he said, “I went there after six
months and the whole thing was changed,

334
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:42,740
vibrated and it's all so green, so beautiful.

335
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:49,570
It’s a remarkable thing to happen.

336
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:56,975
So I think My picture must be giving
balance or something to this acid rain,

337
00:30:56,975 --> 00:30:59,390
or it nourishes these trees.

338
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:04,525
The vibrations after all, vibrations do nourish everything,

339
00:31:04,511 --> 00:31:08,535
and I don’t know what happened to the acid rain.

340
00:31:08,546 --> 00:31:11,046
It’s very different.

341
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:20,175
We can try that everywhere,
vibrated water and these badges.

342
00:31:20,188 --> 00:31:23,673
Even the rings have done great works.

343
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:29,017
He had a problem because they don’t
have well as we have in India.

344
00:31:29,042 --> 00:31:31,208
They only have those taps.

345
00:31:31,202 --> 00:31:42,421
So he removed the joining ring and put his
ring inside that, and then he joined it.

346
00:31:42,424 --> 00:31:49,265
With that ring only, it worked
wonders, can you imagine?

347
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:53,269
Ah, just imagine.

348
00:31:54,889 --> 00:31:57,389
Maybe the ring was emitting.... (break in recording)

349
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:08,961
...what is our status and what is our position.

350
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,470
We are something very different from others.

351
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:13,981
We have so much capacities.

352
00:32:15,576 --> 00:32:26,960
So we must understand what we can do to
really improve the conditions around us,

353
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:29,467
our children, everything,

354
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:33,726
because now you have that
vital force which you can use.

355
00:32:35,281 --> 00:32:40,815
But many Sahaja yogis are such, they do not understand

356
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:48,547
that Sahaja Yoga is not for only for your personal cleanliness or for your personal ascent,

357
00:32:48,547 --> 00:32:56,107
but for the ascent of the whole
universe, of the whole people.

358
00:32:56,117 --> 00:32:59,471
Anywhere there’s a Sahaja yogi you can make it out.

359
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:10,226
Once I was going in a village and I saw a
beautiful, very beautiful field of corn.

360
00:33:10,236 --> 00:33:15,786
Such beautiful corn, such thick, thick seeds in it.

361
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:19,506
He said, "Whose field?"

362
00:33:19,516 --> 00:33:22,466
I asked the Sahaja yogi, I said, "Whose field is this?"

363
00:33:22,486 --> 00:33:24,986
He said, "This is mine."

364
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:28,040
"What did you do?"

365
00:33:28,046 --> 00:33:34,778
"I just got one coconut vibrated by You and put it my well."

366
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:41,436
All these miracles are happening.

367
00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:47,516
Something, when I was building Pratishthan
you see, we didn’t have water or well there.

368
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:50,426
So the neighbour said, “My well
is lying here, you can use it,

369
00:33:50,421 --> 00:33:53,868
 but it only can work for a few days.

370
00:33:53,877 --> 00:33:57,478
You'll have to arrange for water to build the house.

371
00:33:57,497 --> 00:34:00,268
I said, “All right.”

372
00:34:00,264 --> 00:34:05,848
So the first thing Sahaja yogis did was
to put My vibrated water in that well

373
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:08,888
and one coconut.

374
00:34:08,908 --> 00:34:13,378
Suddenly that well started getting filled up.

375
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:19,768
And while building, you see there’s a big ball kept there,

376
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,318
to suck the water up.

377
00:34:21,331 --> 00:34:23,831
The ball was hanging in the air,
but still the water was coming.

378
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:29,990
And the whole of Pratishthan was built with that water.

379
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:36,144
We never had to buy any water and
everybody was amazed. How can it be?

380
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:43,844
But the water from, I don’t know from
where that source, but just sucked it.

381
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:47,988
Till we finished the house,
there was water in that well.

382
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:54,219
Then the fellow said, “I want this
well for my own use."  He'll use it for himself.

383
00:34:54,232 --> 00:34:56,732
Immediately it dried up.

384
00:34:56,732 --> 00:34:58,769
Touched the bottom.

385
00:34:58,772 --> 00:35:01,702
So he came to Me and he said, "I
don't know what has happened.

386
00:35:01,712 --> 00:35:04,812
There's no water, not a drop."

387
00:35:04,822 --> 00:35:07,172
I said, "Really?"

388
00:35:07,182 --> 00:35:09,682
"It's dried out."

389
00:35:09,682 --> 00:35:13,215
So I said, "All right, you take one coconut."

390
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,885
He said,"Your coconut is lying there."

391
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:21,252
I said, "Take another one." It wouldn't.
He took another one, it wouldn't

392
00:35:21,282 --> 00:35:23,532
Then I said, "All right, you get your realisation."

393
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:26,472
We gave him realisation, this that.

394
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:29,852
Then he said, "I would like to sell this well to You."

395
00:35:29,873 --> 00:35:34,113
He sold it to Me, again the water came in.

396
00:35:34,143 --> 00:35:36,643
Poor fellow, now he didn’t
know what to do with that.

397
00:35:36,663 --> 00:35:40,294
So we bought that well. Hari knows about it.

398
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:43,334
We bought that well and now
that well is again all right.

399
00:35:45,133 --> 00:35:48,476
So the nature is a great friend of Sahaja yogis.

400
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:50,994
This is what I am trying to say.

401
00:35:50,994 --> 00:35:53,494
Whatever you want, it will work out for you.

402
00:35:53,506 --> 00:35:57,024
See how the rain came.

403
00:35:57,016 --> 00:35:59,516
Least expected at this time.

404
00:35:59,514 --> 00:36:05,846
You needed it and when I was in the plane
only, I saw all the thundering going on.

405
00:36:07,691 --> 00:36:24,568
In Perth, when we went to the place where they have built a very beautiful cottage, it was all parched and all brown.

406
00:36:24,598 --> 00:36:27,910
When I came it was all green, absolutely green.
