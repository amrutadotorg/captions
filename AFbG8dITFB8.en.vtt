WEBVTT

01:46.417 --> 01:49.250
We all have today gathered here

01:49.583 --> 01:53.166
on top of this beautiful mountain,

01:54.959 --> 01:58.583
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.

01:59.959 --> 02:03.542
It’s very significant for Sahaja yogis

02:03.999 --> 02:09.959
to understand the great event of His resurrection,

02:11.834 --> 02:14.333
by which He showed

02:14.667 --> 02:17.999
that the spirit does not die.

02:18.999 --> 02:22.792
He was – He was the Omkara,

02:23.083 --> 02:27.542
He was the Logos and He was the Spirit,

02:28.333 --> 02:33.709
and that is why He could walk on the water.

02:34.834 --> 02:39.583
And also now we have made a film

02:40.125 --> 02:45.166
where we have shown how the Mooladhara,

02:45.458 --> 02:48.709
which shows the carbon atom,

02:49.250 --> 02:52.999
as clearly if you see from right to the left,

02:53.375 --> 02:56.959
you find a proper swastika there;

02:57.250 --> 03:02.709
and left to the right we see Omkara.

03:03.041 --> 03:05.709
But when you see from down below upward,

03:05.999 --> 03:09.709
what you see is alpha and omega.

03:10.291 --> 03:14.583
That proves beyond doubt that Christ, as He said,

03:14.917 --> 03:18.250
“I am the Alpha and I am the Omega,”

03:18.625 --> 03:25.125
shows clearly that He was the incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

03:26.166 --> 03:29.500
It’s a scientific proof we have now with us,

03:29.875 --> 03:35.500
and that’s how we can tell people that it’s a fact.

03:36.959 --> 03:40.458
I don’t know at the time of Christ

03:40.834 --> 03:44.625
this alpha and omega was known to the mathematicians,

03:44.999 --> 03:47.250
but definitely to Him

03:47.667 --> 03:52.375
when He said, “I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

04:00.125 --> 04:05.417
His was an incarnation very remarkable,

04:06.000 --> 04:11.125
and very important for our ascent.

04:12.667 --> 04:16.041
If He had not resurrected Himself,

04:16.458 --> 04:20.583
we could not have achieved our ascent at all.

04:21.208 --> 04:24.000
So it’s a great contribution.

04:24.500 --> 04:29.250
The resurrection of Christ is evident now in your own life:

04:30.125 --> 04:33.208
what you were before

04:33.583 --> 04:36.792
and what you are today.

04:39.750 --> 04:42.709
It is such a change,

04:43.125 --> 04:45.250
such a difference,

04:45.542 --> 04:48.500
such a transformation.

04:49.375 --> 04:52.959
It is His own sacrifice

04:53.417 --> 04:54.875
on the cross

04:55.125 --> 04:58.875
and His own

04:59.333 --> 05:01.917
beautiful resurrection

05:02.208 --> 05:05.417
has created a way for all of us

05:05.750 --> 05:10.999
to get into this new transformed state.

05:15.709 --> 05:21.625
In this state is a different story for human beings,

05:21.999 --> 05:24.458
and a different for Christ.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.875
Christ was Himself

05:27.208 --> 05:31.375
was holiness, was purity.

05:32.834 --> 05:35.333
So His resurrection

05:35.625 --> 05:42.083
is nothing but just a physical happening, we can say,

05:43.709 --> 05:47.583
because He did not need transformation,

05:49.208 --> 05:51.166
He did not

05:51.458 --> 05:55.959
have to go through any cleansing.

05:57.417 --> 06:00.750
But what happened in His case

06:01.417 --> 06:06.542
was that He became

06:07.999 --> 06:11.208
resurrected from death

06:11.709 --> 06:16.250
– symbolizes the life of human beings without spirituality

06:16.625 --> 06:19.208
is like a death;

06:19.583 --> 06:21.583
because they do everything

06:21.959 --> 06:27.542
without any understanding about the totality,

06:28.750 --> 06:30.917
about the reality,

06:31.250 --> 06:34.291
about the absolute truth.

06:34.625 --> 06:36.875
Whatever they do ultimately

06:37.291 --> 06:41.375
takes them to their destruction.

06:43.041 --> 06:46.375
Even the religions which are established

06:46.750 --> 06:48.834
by these great incarnations

06:49.208 --> 06:53.625
are absolutely on a decline.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
You do not find any trace of religious life

06:58.417 --> 06:59.917
with all those people

07:00.250 --> 07:03.125
who claim that they are the ones

07:03.458 --> 07:07.250
who can represent those incarnations.

07:07.959 --> 07:11.000
If you see in a subtle way

07:11.417 --> 07:13.333
it’s very painful also,

07:13.709 --> 07:17.834
that in the name of all these great incarnations

07:18.208 --> 07:20.750
the kind of work people are doing,

07:21.166 --> 07:25.709
the activities that they take to is something impossible,

07:26.041 --> 07:28.999
because they have no fear of God.

07:29.375 --> 07:32.500
In the name of God they’re doing all these horrible things

07:32.792 --> 07:34.500
all over the world.

07:34.834 --> 07:35.917
Of course here,

07:36.208 --> 07:38.125
you can say Catholic Church has been exposed.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.375
Everywhere people are seeing

07:40.792 --> 07:44.041
all these false things have been exposed.

07:44.417 --> 07:48.291
But these false things they have used

07:48.834 --> 07:52.750
under a garb of God,

07:53.041 --> 07:55.959
spirituality and beauty.

07:56.375 --> 07:59.583
That’s the best way you can hide.

08:00.625 --> 08:05.083
All the cruelty, all the violence,

08:06.000 --> 08:08.917
all the ugliness

08:09.834 --> 08:12.250
– this is how they have worked it out.

08:12.625 --> 08:16.333
And it has gone into such a state

08:16.750 --> 08:19.750
that you do not find the slightest

08:20.166 --> 08:24.625
even tinge of religious life among these people.

08:25.125 --> 08:27.041
Like all the thieves of the world,

08:27.375 --> 08:29.333
all the great crooks of the world

08:29.750 --> 08:33.333
and all the intriguers of the world has taken over.

08:35.583 --> 08:39.875
It’s only because what was written in all the books

08:40.208 --> 08:44.041
and all the scriptures that you have to seek yourself,

08:44.542 --> 08:47.000
was never done.

08:48.542 --> 08:51.999
“You have to know yourself” was never done.

08:52.375 --> 08:55.834
How many times Christ has said, “Know thyself.”

08:56.250 --> 08:58.625
He also said that “You are to be born again”

08:59.041 --> 09:01.917
– so immediately they take a certificate, “I am born again”

09:02.291 --> 09:07.750
and start taking advantage of that kind of a certificate.

09:09.333 --> 09:12.041
But they don’t think that actually

09:12.417 --> 09:15.000
what benevolence it has given them.

09:15.417 --> 09:17.250
At the most they might have made some money,

09:17.667 --> 09:21.041
at the most they might have had some superficial powers;

09:21.417 --> 09:27.417
but it has done nothing, if you see from a innate nature.

09:29.917 --> 09:34.166
One must pity their insanity,

09:34.917 --> 09:38.625
the way they have taken to Christ’s life

09:38.999 --> 09:40.542
or to anybody else’s life

09:40.917 --> 09:45.250
of such a noble and a higher value system,

09:45.709 --> 09:51.750
and are doing all very low-graded things.

09:53.709 --> 09:58.917
In Sahaja Yoga now you have transformed yourself.

09:59.500 --> 10:03.083
I would say your kundalini has done the job.

10:03.750 --> 10:07.792
But still the difference between Christ and you is this,

10:08.166 --> 10:12.792
that you are coming from that environment,

10:13.875 --> 10:15.999
that style of life,

10:16.375 --> 10:18.625
that kind of thinking

10:18.999 --> 10:21.208
which was all for your destruction.

10:21.583 --> 10:25.875
Everything if you see now is for your destruction.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.917
So when you’re coming out of it,

10:29.375 --> 10:32.375
still these things hang over,

10:32.792 --> 10:37.750
still you get affected by them.

10:38.291 --> 10:40.959
Even when you’re rising higher and higher,

10:41.250 --> 10:44.542
you find suddenly you are again pushed down

10:44.875 --> 10:47.417
to some sort of a funny situation,

10:47.750 --> 10:53.208
to some sort of a degrading things.

10:53.834 --> 10:56.667
Of course, sometimes you are shocked at yourself;

10:57.041 --> 10:59.917
sometimes you accept all that.

11:00.375 --> 11:02.709
So for a Sahaja yogi it is very important

11:02.999 --> 11:04.792
that after coming to realization

11:05.208 --> 11:08.208
he has to be very introspective.

11:08.625 --> 11:10.458
Instead of seeing the bad of others,

11:10.792 --> 11:14.583
he should try to see what is bad in within himself.

11:15.125 --> 11:19.333
It’s very important that you have to know

11:19.750 --> 11:23.667
how far you are going towards your spirituality.

11:24.333 --> 11:28.542
Because Christ did not need this,

11:29.166 --> 11:32.875
He did not have to even introspect Himself.

11:33.375 --> 11:39.709
He was something which was beyond any corruption,

11:40.583 --> 11:46.875
and for Him it was just a physical transformation,

11:47.208 --> 11:49.542
on the sense that from He died

11:49.999 --> 11:53.041
and then He resurrected Himself.

11:53.500 --> 11:56.750
But for us it is very different.

11:57.166 --> 12:00.166
We are now Sahaja yogis,

12:00.542 --> 12:04.041
but we were ordinary human beings.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.917
We had no light within us.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.333
Now the light comes within us

12:09.709 --> 12:11.999
and we see the light,

12:12.333 --> 12:15.709
then what do we become?

12:16.083 --> 12:19.583
We have to become the light itself.

12:20.125 --> 12:21.750
Christ was the light.

12:22.125 --> 12:23.667
He did not have to become.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
So we have to become the light.

12:26.291 --> 12:30.208
And now you have to guard on

12:31.083 --> 12:34.667
the way this light might get disturbed,

12:35.000 --> 12:40.333
might be reduced, or may be completely extinguished.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.458
So carrying on yourself with this light,

12:46.792 --> 12:49.166
first thing you should know that

12:49.583 --> 12:51.834
if you see the light, is not proper

12:52.166 --> 12:53.500
– means you are not the light.

12:53.875 --> 12:57.333
You have to become the light.

12:58.625 --> 13:00.166
When you are the light,

13:00.625 --> 13:03.208
then in that light you can easily see

13:03.542 --> 13:06.041
how your mind works,

13:06.542 --> 13:08.625
what ideas it gives,

13:09.000 --> 13:15.542
what affects your mind

13:16.250 --> 13:18.208
while you’re ascending.

13:18.542 --> 13:20.458
Is this the worry

13:20.750 --> 13:26.250
or is this the responsibility that you have?

13:26.625 --> 13:30.875
Or is this from the bad habits you had,

13:31.291 --> 13:33.041
that there is an impediment

13:33.417 --> 13:38.542
in your growth as a spiritual personality?

13:39.250 --> 13:41.999
So you have to guard yourself all the time,

13:42.375 --> 13:47.375
and see for yourself how you are progressing.

13:48.875 --> 13:51.875
It’s a very beautiful journey

13:52.250 --> 13:53.959
– very, very beautiful journey.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.625
Yesterday I was very much happy to hear

13:56.999 --> 14:01.625
the song of the Russians who describe about the journey,

14:02.792 --> 14:07.875
the journey of kundalini.

14:09.959 --> 14:17.583
This is true, no doubt, that you are a realized soul.

14:19.250 --> 14:23.959
Basically you were not a realized soul,

14:24.542 --> 14:27.208
but now you are a realized soul.

14:27.709 --> 14:29.583
You are a evolved state.

14:30.041 --> 14:35.792
Now what is missing is the idea

14:36.250 --> 14:41.208
that we are absolutely all right

14:41.709 --> 14:46.000
and nothing can harm us, nothing can bring us down.

14:47.417 --> 14:52.041
If you develop such an egoistical idea,

14:52.542 --> 14:55.208
it’s not going to help you at all.

14:55.709 --> 14:58.709
What you have to do is to

14:59.500 --> 15:01.333
all the time introspect yourself.

15:01.750 --> 15:03.917
That’s what is meditation for,

15:04.291 --> 15:05.834
to see for yourself

15:06.166 --> 15:10.291
how you are keeping up

15:10.792 --> 15:13.959
your spiritual ascent.

15:14.458 --> 15:15.875
No one else can do it,

15:16.291 --> 15:18.709
it’s your own individual work.

15:18.999 --> 15:20.959
Of course, if you go to the collective, immediately

15:21.208 --> 15:24.000
they will know what chakras you are catching, no doubt.

15:24.375 --> 15:28.125
They may not say, they may not refer it,

15:28.542 --> 15:29.999
but they will know definitely

15:30.375 --> 15:32.125
that such-and-such chakra is catching

15:32.542 --> 15:34.458
and this person has this problem.

15:34.875 --> 15:39.583
But they won’t know themselves what they are catching,

15:41.125 --> 15:44.083
what is their problem is.

15:44.625 --> 15:46.542
So if somebody tells you

15:46.917 --> 15:48.792
that “I think this chakra is catching in you,”

15:49.083 --> 15:51.792
you should never, never feel bad about it,

15:52.125 --> 15:54.834
because by keeping that chakra intact

15:55.125 --> 15:58.041
you are ruining your own life.

15:58.542 --> 16:00.999
So what you have to do is to see

16:01.375 --> 16:03.125
that if somebody tells you that

16:03.500 --> 16:07.417
“I think this chakra is, there’s something wrong,”

16:07.792 --> 16:10.375
you should thank that person, “Thank God you’ve told me.”

16:10.792 --> 16:13.375
Like a mirror – if you see in the mirror

16:13.750 --> 16:15.917
there’s something wrong with your face,

16:16.208 --> 16:17.625
you can immediately correct it.

16:17.999 --> 16:21.625
In the same way if somebody points it out to you,

16:22.000 --> 16:25.417
you have to be mature enough that you should know

16:25.750 --> 16:27.417
that it is a great blessing

16:27.834 --> 16:30.917
that such thing has been pointed out to you.

16:31.917 --> 16:33.583
Like the other day there was some quarrel

16:33.917 --> 16:35.333
between the two leaders.

16:35.709 --> 16:38.166
Always – there are two leaders, always there are quarrels.

16:38.458 --> 16:39.750
There should not be.

16:39.959 --> 16:43.542
It’s like two eyes never fight, two hands don’t fight,

16:43.917 --> 16:45.208
two legs do not fight.

16:45.583 --> 16:48.500
But if there are two leaders, there’s always a problem.

16:48.917 --> 16:53.041
You have to have always one leader, otherwise big problem.

16:53.834 --> 16:56.625
So they were arguing among themselves, you see,

16:56.999 --> 17:01.583
two leaders arguing among themselves, and they came to Me.

17:02.083 --> 17:05.625
Immediately I saw one of them was absolutely caught up.

17:06.083 --> 17:08.291
I said, “You put your hands towards Me.”

17:08.709 --> 17:10.291
When he puts his hand towards Me,

17:10.709 --> 17:13.583
immediately he pushed it back. “What happened?”

17:13.917 --> 17:16.125
He said, “I’m getting burning sensation, Mother.”

17:16.500 --> 17:20.333
I said, “That’s it. Now, do you know what’s wrong with you?”

17:20.709 --> 17:22.834
He says, “I’m very hot-tempered, that I know.

17:23.166 --> 17:26.875
I’m very egoistical. I should not have behaved like this.”

17:27.709 --> 17:32.959
But at the same time he could have felt very bad,

17:33.333 --> 17:35.875
because I said it to him.

17:36.500 --> 17:39.458
But he did not because he’s a Sahaja yogi

17:39.959 --> 17:41.792
and he knows what is benevolent for him,

17:42.208 --> 17:43.250
what is good for him.

17:43.542 --> 17:45.000
He did not feel bad at all.

17:45.375 --> 17:47.500
On the contrary, he was so thankful to Me that

17:47.875 --> 17:50.667
“Mother, because of You I have been found out.

17:51.041 --> 17:55.417
Otherwise I was hiding it within my heart.”

18:02.417 --> 18:06.000
Now, the problem with us is that

18:06.333 --> 18:10.625
we have achieved a lot of development within ourself,

18:11.709 --> 18:14.125
and we have consolidated it.

18:14.625 --> 18:16.625
Also, we have a great collective force,

18:17.000 --> 18:19.500
I can see, in every country.

18:19.959 --> 18:22.667
We can give realizations to so many,

18:23.125 --> 18:25.667
and we can really establish

18:26.083 --> 18:30.792
all these great truths in our lives.

18:31.208 --> 18:32.625
We can do it.

18:32.959 --> 18:36.500
All the time we should establish them.

18:37.291 --> 18:40.667
But there is one point

18:41.041 --> 18:44.125
on which one should not be very sure:

18:44.583 --> 18:50.750
that you have absolutely reached the last truth.

18:51.750 --> 18:54.417
You have to be careful on this point very much.

18:54.834 --> 19:00.625
I have seen people who go very high in Sahaja Yoga,

19:01.000 --> 19:05.709
come up very high, and suddenly they go down very low.

19:06.792 --> 19:10.125
Makes Me very sad, extremely sad.

19:10.667 --> 19:13.917
The reason is that they have no faith

19:14.291 --> 19:20.875
– faith in themself and faith in Sahaj.

19:22.166 --> 19:24.959
This is the faith which is missing.

19:25.542 --> 19:30.166
You have to have faith in yourself and faith in Sahaj.

19:30.750 --> 19:35.125
Sahaj means there is the divine Power,

19:36.875 --> 19:43.458
and this all-pervading divine Power is looking after us.

19:46.375 --> 19:51.166
It is now felt also, you have felt it.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.291
It’s not that only by saying it’s there

19:53.625 --> 19:55.709
– you have known that it is so.

19:56.041 --> 19:57.709
But even knowing that,

19:58.041 --> 20:01.542
it has not become such a faith within you.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.792
But this is the faith about Christ has talked.

20:06.208 --> 20:08.667
This is the faith with an enlightened mind,

20:08.999 --> 20:10.500
not the blind faith.

20:10.917 --> 20:14.333
And with the blind you might make mistakes,

20:14.875 --> 20:18.875
while with the enlightened one if you have faith

20:19.166 --> 20:24.125
you become extremely powerful, extremely powerful.

20:24.583 --> 20:26.750
There cannot be any problems

20:27.125 --> 20:30.583
if your faith is enlightened.

20:32.125 --> 20:34.250
So now, you see in Sahaja Yoga

20:34.667 --> 20:38.083
many people who are very steady,

20:39.999 --> 20:43.000
who are upright,

20:43.625 --> 20:45.875
who are very valuable.

20:46.417 --> 20:48.208
They are like the people

20:48.583 --> 20:51.750
who know they are standing on the rocks.

20:52.291 --> 20:56.333
But those who are not yet so steady are the people,

20:56.625 --> 20:59.750
they think they are still dwindling

21:00.125 --> 21:05.834
on some sort of a funny waters of this life.

21:07.959 --> 21:12.041
The rocks have been there, you’re standing on the rocks;

21:12.500 --> 21:16.667
and also that has come out of faith

21:17.000 --> 21:20.166
that nothing can disturb us, that faith,

21:20.625 --> 21:23.166
nothing can trouble us.

21:23.709 --> 21:27.000
As far as Christ is concerned, naturally,

21:27.417 --> 21:29.083
I mean, He knew everything,

21:29.458 --> 21:31.500
so He was sure about it.

21:31.999 --> 21:35.667
He never bothered, He never dwindled, He never doubted.

21:36.166 --> 21:39.709
He knew that, that He is the Son of God,

21:40.125 --> 21:42.750
and that was the fact that He knew very well.

21:43.166 --> 21:45.917
And He never challenged it, He never doubted it, nothing.

21:46.291 --> 21:48.166
It is so.

21:48.625 --> 21:52.834
And that’s why He, I say, was standing on the rocks;

21:53.291 --> 21:56.667
while the other people,

21:59.375 --> 22:01.291
even Sahaja yogis,

22:01.667 --> 22:04.959
have to become like Christ

22:05.291 --> 22:08.208
as far as the faith is concerned.

22:08.792 --> 22:13.166
This faith is to be understood.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.792
This is an enlightened faith.

22:17.208 --> 22:21.500
Like Christ – He went into crucifixion,

22:21.917 --> 22:24.375
He went into all kinds of things,

22:24.834 --> 22:28.792
just because He knew it was just a drama

22:29.125 --> 22:33.417
and He was doing all this just in a drama, playing;

22:33.875 --> 22:37.166
and there’s nothing serious,

22:38.125 --> 22:39.333
nothing is going to matter,

22:39.667 --> 22:41.166
and that He’s going to resurrect Himself.

22:41.542 --> 22:43.792
He played the drama.

22:44.291 --> 22:47.750
To Him it was nothing very serious.

22:50.166 --> 22:53.999
He saw people making fun of Him, mocking at Him.

22:54.625 --> 22:58.750
He also in His heart knew everything that

22:59.125 --> 23:03.125
“These people who are mocking don’t know what I am.”

23:03.834 --> 23:07.999
But at the same time,

23:09.000 --> 23:11.917
He was the embodiment of faith:

23:12.417 --> 23:16.917
faith in Himself

23:17.250 --> 23:20.999
and in this all-pervading Power.

23:22.417 --> 23:24.709
This never lets you down,

23:25.166 --> 23:30.083
but for that you have to have absolute faith.

23:30.792 --> 23:35.542
Supposing I have someone on whom I have faith,

23:36.792 --> 23:40.875
naturally I will give him all the work,

23:41.458 --> 23:43.792
I will trust everything,

23:44.208 --> 23:47.125
I’ll keep the keys with him or the money with him,

23:47.458 --> 23:50.750
never doubt such a person.

23:51.917 --> 23:57.166
In the same way if you have faith – faith in yourself,

23:57.834 --> 24:04.625
faith in Sahaja Yoga where you are established

24:05.417 --> 24:09.542
– you’ll be surprised how things will work out,

24:11.333 --> 24:13.125
how life will improve

24:13.583 --> 24:18.709
and you will be standing on the rocks, you’ll feel that way.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.542
You’ll have no doubts,

24:21.917 --> 24:26.667
you’ll have no problems, no diseases.

24:29.291 --> 24:33.458
So, this is such a state

24:33.999 --> 24:35.709
– only with faith.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.959
But now this faith, how do you get?

24:39.375 --> 24:43.542
The problem is, how to get to this faith?

24:43.917 --> 24:45.333
There’s no course about it,

24:45.750 --> 24:47.542
there’s no literature about it,

24:47.917 --> 24:50.166
there’s no lecture about it.

24:50.583 --> 24:56.041
But there is an awakening within you

24:56.500 --> 25:00.542
which will ask this

25:01.125 --> 25:03.583
“What am I?” – this awakening,

25:03.959 --> 25:06.375
“What am I? What have I achieved?”

25:06.750 --> 25:12.208
You see, this will question

25:14.291 --> 25:18.083
“What is it that I have achieved?

25:18.500 --> 25:21.750
What have I got out of Sahaja Yoga?”

25:22.208 --> 25:24.792
All these questions will come to you.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.333
But if you have faith,

25:27.792 --> 25:30.166
not the blind but the enlightened

25:30.625 --> 25:33.125
which is established by many miracles in life,

25:33.500 --> 25:34.625
many things in life;

25:34.999 --> 25:37.792
small, small things you’ll find there have been miracles,

25:38.125 --> 25:39.333
small, small things.

25:39.667 --> 25:41.750
There have been miracles even in big things,

25:42.125 --> 25:45.875
in so many things where you never expected this will happen.

25:46.291 --> 25:47.917
So now you know, very well settled,

25:48.333 --> 25:51.834
that you are now very nicely in Sahaja Yoga.

25:52.166 --> 25:54.917
For example, it starts raining.

25:55.417 --> 25:58.500
Half of you would get worried about it why it’s raining,

25:58.917 --> 26:01.542
but they will know that there’s a very beautiful roof,

26:01.917 --> 26:03.125
nothing can happen.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.667
Let it rain as much as it likes.

26:06.041 --> 26:09.792
And then you’ll have faith that it is not going to rain,

26:10.208 --> 26:11.875
it’s not going to drench us.

26:12.208 --> 26:17.375
In the same way this faith within us

26:17.750 --> 26:21.458
has to be absolutely solid,

26:22.208 --> 26:26.125
and that makes you extremely strong

26:26.583 --> 26:29.000
and makes you responsible

26:29.375 --> 26:31.625
for the resurrection of thousands

26:31.959 --> 26:36.417
and thousands and thousands and thousands of people.

26:41.834 --> 26:45.834
This kind of life that we have

26:47.250 --> 26:52.917
– that only by our own establishment,

26:53.375 --> 26:57.000
by our own understanding,

26:57.458 --> 27:03.041
by our own observation that we settle into ourselves,

27:04.083 --> 27:06.625
we settle into Sahaja Yoga

27:07.834 --> 27:11.208
– it’s something remarkable, but it should, it has happened,

27:11.625 --> 27:15.792
it is happening, and should happen to all of you.

27:16.291 --> 27:20.417
You all should have the chance

27:20.999 --> 27:24.583
to know your spirit

27:25.041 --> 27:29.208
and to know yourself.

27:29.999 --> 27:32.667
So one has to have faith in oneself.

27:33.125 --> 27:35.333
I’ve seen some Sahaja yoginis always come and say,

27:35.750 --> 27:38.709
“Mother, I am no good, I am useless. I am doing no work.

27:39.041 --> 27:43.083
I’m absolutely a lazy lump,” or whatever it is.

27:46.333 --> 27:50.166
It’s all right, you think that way – ask for it.

27:51.041 --> 27:53.792
What do you want?

27:54.208 --> 27:58.458
Even if you don’t ask it will work out,

28:00.417 --> 28:02.417
even if you don’t ask.

28:02.875 --> 28:08.375
Even you just think about it, it will work out.

28:08.959 --> 28:12.291
Even if you pay attention it will work out,

28:12.792 --> 28:15.333
because this all-pervading Power

28:15.875 --> 28:17.458
is the only real power,

28:17.834 --> 28:20.750
the all the rest of the powers are useless.

28:21.583 --> 28:28.333
And it’s so very efficient, so compassionate

28:29.000 --> 28:36.083
that in the split of the second it can work out things.

28:37.458 --> 28:40.750
The other day we had somebody from Australia,

28:41.166 --> 28:42.834
and he was deceived by someone

28:43.250 --> 28:45.667
and made him buy a land and a house

28:46.083 --> 28:49.999
at a very exorbitant price, for which he had no money.

28:50.458 --> 28:51.375
And this fellow said,

28:51.667 --> 28:53.208
“Doesn’t matter even if you don’t have money,

28:53.583 --> 28:55.291
they will not say anything to you.”

28:55.625 --> 28:57.999
He believed him – had wrong faith,

28:58.291 --> 29:02.000
I should say, and then he said, “All right.”

29:02.333 --> 29:07.875
He paid all the money that he had, just to reserve it.

29:09.999 --> 29:14.834
Somebody went there, there was a puja so so many went there.

29:17.625 --> 29:21.333
So many pujas, you see, and things happened,

29:21.750 --> 29:24.667
and so many people came and saw all this.

29:25.083 --> 29:29.208
But this fellow was so upset, so upset,

29:29.625 --> 29:30.875
he could not understand,

29:31.291 --> 29:32.875
“Why it has happened to me

29:33.291 --> 29:37.250
that I am placed into such a difficult situation?”

29:39.041 --> 29:40.917
And he was deceived and he was,

29:41.583 --> 29:43.917
I mean, absolutely flabbergasted.

29:44.333 --> 29:48.083
He had no idea as to how he will get out of this mess.

29:48.625 --> 29:51.917
He had put in all his money there, everything was involved,

29:52.291 --> 29:58.500
and if he doesn’t pay that money he would have been in jail.

30:00.250 --> 30:04.542
I just wrote to him, “Have faith in yourself.”

30:04.959 --> 30:08.041
That’s all – “Have faith.”

30:08.667 --> 30:10.750
And what a miraculous thing happened,

30:11.125 --> 30:15.875
that somebody else offered a much higher price for that.

30:18.999 --> 30:20.834
And that fellow said,

30:21.291 --> 30:24.250
“Of course I’ll pay it whatever you have promised.

30:24.709 --> 30:27.667
I’ll pay you back, and I’ll pay you all the more

30:28.083 --> 30:31.917
that I want to pay.”

30:33.083 --> 30:38.208
It’s something unbelievable.

30:40.417 --> 30:43.834
So many went there, so many wanted to solve the problem,

30:44.208 --> 30:48.417
did this, met the fellow and told them that he cannot pay.

30:48.709 --> 30:51.542
Nothing worked out, nothing

30:52.041 --> 30:54.041
– only his faith.

30:54.500 --> 30:58.166
And can you imagine, now he’s going to become a rich man.

30:58.834 --> 31:00.125
He was supposed to go to jail,

31:00.500 --> 31:01.792
now he’s going to become a rich man.

31:02.166 --> 31:04.583
There are many miracles like that, that happen.

31:05.083 --> 31:06.583
This is just the financial side of it,

31:06.959 --> 31:07.792
but I know you know

31:08.125 --> 31:10.041
that there are so many other miracles happening.

31:10.542 --> 31:14.667
After realization if you do not have faith, that shows,

31:15.083 --> 31:18.500
I mean, you are a very poor personality.

31:18.999 --> 31:22.583
After realization at least you should take to faith.

31:23.250 --> 31:25.917
That really is something surprising

31:26.250 --> 31:28.333
that people get their realization and everything,

31:28.792 --> 31:33.083
still they do not have faith in themselves.

31:33.667 --> 31:38.917
Those who have had, have really achieved so much.

31:39.709 --> 31:44.291
Now, the difference between us and Christ is that

31:44.667 --> 31:47.333
faith was part and parcel of His being.

31:47.834 --> 31:52.542
It was not that He had to have faith – He was faith.

31:53.208 --> 31:56.125
Now we have to have it.

31:56.709 --> 32:00.375
We have to believe in ourselves.

32:01.041 --> 32:03.083
There’s so many incidents I can give you

32:03.625 --> 32:05.959
which you can also tell Me, so many incidents

32:06.375 --> 32:10.375
where just the faith has helped.

32:11.625 --> 32:14.125
If you were in Romania I think it happened,

32:14.625 --> 32:16.792
one lady came on the stage, she couldn’t walk,

32:17.166 --> 32:19.375
they had to bring her on a wheelchair.

32:19.875 --> 32:23.542
And she said, “Mother, I know You can cure me.

32:23.834 --> 32:25.999
Nobody can cure me; I know You can cure me.”

32:26.291 --> 32:27.625
She said it three times.

32:27.999 --> 32:29.959
I said, “So, you believe that I’ll cure you.”

32:30.291 --> 32:32.583
“Yes.” I said, “Then get up.”

32:32.917 --> 32:34.667
She just got up, walked out.

32:35.041 --> 32:37.542
And then she started running all the way,

32:37.959 --> 32:39.917
and everybody started laughing.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.959
They said, “Mother, she’s not a Sahaja yogini!”

32:42.333 --> 32:44.583
I said, “But see her faith!”

32:45.250 --> 32:51.125
Because when there is faith all the deities take it up:

32:52.083 --> 32:58.458
they’re challenged, they have to do it.

32:59.625 --> 33:02.166
They have shown faith in that person.

33:02.542 --> 33:04.000
As I have told you always,

33:04.333 --> 33:07.333
in Sahaja Yoga we trust people, we trust.

33:07.792 --> 33:09.417
One among hundred might deceive us

33:09.709 --> 33:11.208
doesn’t matter, we trust.

33:11.583 --> 33:15.333
That faith you put in that person works in his mind also,

33:15.750 --> 33:17.542
that “they have put so much faith in me.”

33:17.999 --> 33:20.834
But what about deities?

33:21.291 --> 33:24.166
You show faith in them and it works,

33:24.583 --> 33:25.917
immediately they work out.

33:26.333 --> 33:27.583
Like Guido told Me that

33:27.959 --> 33:30.709
“Mother, they said there will be heavy rains

33:31.208 --> 33:32.875
for these two days.”

33:33.291 --> 33:37.375
I said, “All right. Don’t worry.” ,Where is the rain?

33:38.625 --> 33:41.458
It disappeared.

33:41.917 --> 33:47.458
You can control anything if your faith is under control.

33:50.083 --> 33:54.291
And when we talk of faith, you know,

33:55.125 --> 34:00.583
it’s the challenge to this all-pervading Power,

34:01.709 --> 34:06.417
which organizes, which knows everything,

34:06.959 --> 34:09.041
which is so intelligent, efficient

34:09.458 --> 34:10.999
– above all, it loves you.

34:11.375 --> 34:14.458
And then you show faith.

34:16.000 --> 34:23.125
The resurrection in Sahaja Yoga is that your faith is solid.

34:24.375 --> 34:29.083
This you have to achieve: solid faith.

34:29.709 --> 34:31.000
They don’t feel then bad,

34:31.417 --> 34:34.125
supposing I may not meet them, supposing I may say,

34:34.500 --> 34:37.000
“All right, come. You see, this time I may not be there.”

34:37.375 --> 34:40.458
Nothing matters, you see, whether Mother meets us or not,

34:40.875 --> 34:43.375
whether this thing happens or not.

34:43.875 --> 34:47.792
Everything is for our good, for our benevolence.

34:48.250 --> 34:49.458
Supposing you are lost on the way,

34:49.834 --> 34:53.125
know that it has to be that way.

34:53.959 --> 34:57.667
If you have to look at the life of Christ,

34:58.041 --> 34:59.583
He was to be crucified.

34:59.999 --> 35:01.417
He had to carry the cross,

35:01.875 --> 35:05.375
He had to do all these things – it’s all right, whatever.

35:05.875 --> 35:07.792
“It’s fated. I’ll do it.”

35:08.125 --> 35:10.667
He never grumbled, He never grudged,

35:11.083 --> 35:15.041
He didn’t want anybody to share His problems.

35:15.583 --> 35:18.583
But this faith in Him gave Him

35:18.875 --> 35:24.083
such a tremendous powers.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.208
He could have done anything.

35:27.625 --> 35:29.709
He could have killed all these people

35:30.000 --> 35:33.625
who were trying to persecute Him, easily – what’s the harm?

35:33.999 --> 35:35.959
Just one glance could have killed them.

35:36.375 --> 35:39.417
But no, He knew He had to go through all that,

35:39.750 --> 35:40.959
He went through it.

35:41.291 --> 35:44.792
Ultimately, He is the one who’s victorious,

35:45.166 --> 35:48.000
He is the one who won everything.

35:48.709 --> 35:50.542
In the same way, a Sahaja yogi

35:50.917 --> 35:52.750
has to look at one’s own life.

35:53.166 --> 35:59.542
It’s very precious, life, it’s very precious in this world.

36:00.458 --> 36:04.583
These days, the how many there are Sahaja yogis?

36:05.083 --> 36:06.999
In the evolutionary process

36:07.417 --> 36:10.959
how many will become Sahaja yogis, I can’t say.

36:11.542 --> 36:17.792
And once look at the world, then you start feeling that

36:18.291 --> 36:20.834
most of it is going to be destroyed or finished,

36:21.250 --> 36:24.000
most of the people are not going to be there.

36:24.458 --> 36:25.917
Not that we are not available,

36:26.333 --> 36:31.999
but because they are not fated

36:32.583 --> 36:34.250
to come to Sahaja Yoga,

36:34.583 --> 36:36.875
they’re not meant to come to Sahaja Yoga.

36:37.250 --> 36:38.792
So, you are so fortunate

36:39.166 --> 36:43.041
that you have got your realization, your resurrection.

36:43.417 --> 36:46.417
But now have faith in that resurrection of yours,

36:46.834 --> 36:51.250
in your resurrection that is your being now.

36:51.750 --> 36:54.792
And with that you will know how precious

36:55.166 --> 36:57.959
you are for the whole world,

36:58.333 --> 37:00.458
and that what you have to do is not

37:00.792 --> 37:03.542
to think of material gains, physical gains

37:03.999 --> 37:09.250
or some emotional gains, but spiritual gains.

37:10.125 --> 37:14.667
What have we done for spirituality, our own and of others?

37:15.166 --> 37:17.208
This is the only thing that you have to think about,

37:17.583 --> 37:19.834
and you’ll be amazed, everything is organized,

37:20.208 --> 37:21.291
everything works out,

37:21.792 --> 37:25.458
everything in its own time shows its own results.

37:27.625 --> 37:31.417
Now I am sure at least eighty percent of you

37:31.917 --> 37:36.959
believe into what I am saying – maybe, say, ninety percent.

37:40.000 --> 37:45.917
But there could be about ten percent who still think that

37:46.250 --> 37:47.750
“All right, Mother says so.

37:48.083 --> 37:51.291
But then why it happened, why that happened?”

37:51.875 --> 37:53.542
Like the other day I had a journalist,

37:54.000 --> 37:56.959
very well-known person, he said, “I can’t believe in God.”

37:57.333 --> 37:58.333
I said, “Why?”

37:58.667 --> 38:03.000
“Because how can there be such miseries in this world?

38:03.417 --> 38:05.375
How can there be a blind child,

38:05.667 --> 38:08.166
how can this and how can that?”

38:08.625 --> 38:11.083
Then he started giving Me instances. “All right now,”

38:11.375 --> 38:13.208
I said, “have you told Me everything?” "Yes".

38:13.625 --> 38:16.917
I said, “Now, supposing we say that

38:17.166 --> 38:22.208
you are sitting in the realm of congress government,

38:22.583 --> 38:27.083
or your Andreotti government or whatever you call it.

38:28.583 --> 38:31.917
So the situation is explainable;

38:32.333 --> 38:36.792
you have not yet gone into the realm of God.

38:37.500 --> 38:41.250
If you go to that state, and if you achieve it

38:41.667 --> 38:43.542
and if you settle down, then tell Me,

38:44.000 --> 38:47.959
have you any problems? None.”

38:50.792 --> 38:53.000
I said, “Why do you see to the negative side?

38:53.417 --> 38:57.208
Now if you say that there is a way out

38:57.667 --> 39:00.667
and that there is a solution,

39:01.083 --> 39:04.125
and that a time can come

39:04.458 --> 39:07.375
when in this race of Sahaja yogis there will be no diseases,

39:07.792 --> 39:11.166
no troubles, nothing, no problems;

39:12.999 --> 39:14.667
so why not see this?

39:15.041 --> 39:18.750
Why do you want to see one boy who is blind?

39:20.041 --> 39:23.999
But why don’t you see that the blind become all right?”

39:25.667 --> 39:27.834
So this kind of negative attitude

39:28.208 --> 39:30.333
also Sahaja yogis can have.

39:30.792 --> 39:33.041
I’ve seen them: somebody’s sick,

39:33.500 --> 39:35.999
they’ll say, “Mother, he’s sick. I must bring him to You.

39:36.291 --> 39:39.542
You must see them.” There’s no need at all.

39:40.083 --> 39:44.542
You can cure, your faith can cure.

39:45.041 --> 39:47.875
You know about somebody whose uncle was sick,

39:48.250 --> 39:49.500
who was not a Sahaja yogi.

39:49.999 --> 39:53.625
He went down there to see him, and his wife said that

39:53.999 --> 39:56.250
“You are capable of praying to Mother.

39:56.750 --> 40:01.166
Why don’t you tell Her to get my husband all right?”

40:01.583 --> 40:04.375
He was a cancer patient on deathbed.

40:04.834 --> 40:07.583
He said, “All right.” He just bowed down and he prayed,

40:07.917 --> 40:10.083
“Mother, please cure my uncle.”

40:10.500 --> 40:11.959
Third day he was out of hospital,

40:12.208 --> 40:14.417
and now he’s roaming about all over the world.

40:14.834 --> 40:18.417
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, still it has worked;

40:18.834 --> 40:21.041
because now a Sahaja yogi saying that,

40:21.417 --> 40:23.709
the deities have to work it out.

40:24.166 --> 40:27.333
Though he’s not a Sahaja yogi, doesn’t matter.

40:27.875 --> 40:30.709
It’s the deities who stood by it.

40:34.667 --> 40:41.125
And this one has to believe in oneself, fully,

40:41.917 --> 40:47.917
that if these powers are with us, why not we use it?

40:48.667 --> 40:52.166
Why not we develop that complete faith

40:52.667 --> 40:54.542
that we are now Sahaja yogis,

40:54.959 --> 40:57.917
we are in the Kingdom of God,

40:58.417 --> 41:02.667
and that this Power is going to look after us?

41:03.208 --> 41:05.792
Then we’ll have no choices,

41:06.250 --> 41:12.125
we’ll have no hesitation.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.542
We’ll not bother, if you have to go to, say,

41:16.959 --> 41:19.417
to Singapore or you have to go to Africa

41:19.834 --> 41:21.999
or go anywhere – so what?

41:22.458 --> 41:25.667
We are still in the Kingdom of God wherever we go,

41:26.041 --> 41:28.667
it’s perfectly all right.

41:29.208 --> 41:31.583
And no worry of any kind.

41:32.000 --> 41:34.542
We are slaves of so many things, of our watches,

41:34.875 --> 41:37.291
we are slaves of conditionings, things like that.

41:37.667 --> 41:39.417
Everything drops out.

41:39.834 --> 41:41.125
Doesn’t matter.

41:41.542 --> 41:44.417
What does it matter? Nothing is important.

41:44.875 --> 41:48.667
As long as you are with yourself, everything is all right.

41:49.125 --> 41:50.083
Like people tell Me,

41:50.417 --> 41:51.792
“Mother, You travel so much. How do You do it?”

41:52.125 --> 41:54.917
I said, “I never travel. As I am sitting here in the chair,

41:55.166 --> 41:57.750
I am sitting there in the chair, that’s all;

41:58.208 --> 41:59.333
only the seat is changed.

41:59.750 --> 42:02.000
I never think I’m traveling. Nicely sitting down,

42:02.375 --> 42:07.125
settled in My seat I’m all right, so I am not tired.”

42:08.583 --> 42:14.709
So when you have complete faith in yourself,

42:15.250 --> 42:17.792
then you don’t bother.

42:18.250 --> 42:20.709
Many people will find out whether

42:21.041 --> 42:23.458
“I go there – there’ll be a bathroom or not,

42:23.834 --> 42:28.375
or there will be a place to sleep or not?” Nothing.

42:30.875 --> 42:33.291
You are looking for the comfort of your spirit.

42:33.709 --> 42:37.333
If you get, well and good, otherwise you can sleep anywhere.

42:37.834 --> 42:40.709
Nothing can bind you,

42:41.166 --> 42:42.917
nothing can pull you down,

42:43.250 --> 42:47.083
no habit can come back on you;

42:49.083 --> 42:54.375
because faith will purify you completely,

42:54.959 --> 42:58.000
it will enlighten you, it will nourish you.

42:58.500 --> 43:02.291
This faith is not something

43:02.750 --> 43:04.375
that can be put into your heads

43:04.792 --> 43:08.375
or can be put into your hearts, cannot be.

43:09.083 --> 43:13.917
It’s a state which you have to achieve,

43:14.625 --> 43:19.625
and which you can achieve through Sahaja Yoga.

43:20.250 --> 43:24.834
That’s how our resurrection would be complete,

43:25.959 --> 43:27.959
would be established,

43:28.417 --> 43:30.125
would be effective,

43:30.542 --> 43:35.917
and for the whole world will be a model.

43:37.500 --> 43:41.083
May God bless you all.

44:13.875 --> 44:18.375
There are just the children, there are so many children.

44:21.458 --> 44:22.959
Today is the day of Christ,

44:23.250 --> 44:27.417
so we should have children in any case to wash My feet.

44:29.208 --> 44:33.709
Can you fit it there, or you will have to move it?
