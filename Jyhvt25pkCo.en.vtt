00:01.170 --> 00:05.060
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna

00:08.150 --> 00:14.030
as a very great personality.

00:15.180 --> 00:20.240
And you know why He came on this earth –

00:22.030 --> 00:30.120
to establish this is the new form of, not Virat, not Virata,

00:32.000 --> 00:42.010
but a form by which this country became so prosperous.

00:47.220 --> 00:55.030
And by His advent only He created a beautiful mentality

00:55.160 --> 01:04.200
among the people how to develop this country with Dharma.

01:07.050 --> 01:09.140
And you had very great leaders

01:12.050 --> 01:14.090
who followed Him

01:17.050 --> 01:22.010
and who worshipped Him in a way,

01:23.120 --> 01:29.040
and created a new world of this America.

01:31.180 --> 01:34.170
But unfortunately as the time passed on,

01:35.210 --> 01:42.220
His form vanished from the minds of the people.

01:44.090 --> 01:48.130
The reason was, Krishna was represented here

01:49.020 --> 01:54.010
by very, very wrong type of people who had no idea

01:54.170 --> 01:57.100
about Shri Krishna:

02:00.240 --> 02:08.140
that He was a great master of wealth,

02:10.030 --> 02:16.040
that He knew how to use the wealth and how to create

02:16.170 --> 02:20.170
the wealth with dharma, not with adharma.

02:22.170 --> 02:26.180
They all forgot about it completely

02:27.090 --> 02:31.070
and gradually started using maneuvering powers,

02:31.240 --> 02:41.100
all kinds of, all kinds of adharmic things – cheating, grabbing

02:41.240 --> 02:50.000
money, spending their money in absolutely useless things.

02:52.240 --> 02:57.120
He is Kubera. He doesn’t need any money, of course,

02:58.170 --> 03:01.210
He achieves money;

03:03.240 --> 03:06.010
and not only that,

03:06.200 --> 03:10.020
He is living, He lived in money.

03:11.040 --> 03:17.160
They said that He created a golden house for Him,

03:18.080 --> 03:23.080
absolutely made with gold in Dwarika,

03:23.240 --> 03:26.120
but it submerged in the water,

03:26.210 --> 03:33.100
in the sea, and nobody believed that it is true.

03:33.220 --> 03:38.100
But now they have found out His house under the water,

03:38.200 --> 03:40.030
very deep waters,

03:41.000 --> 03:48.030
so all their conjecture about Him was wrong, all false;

03:48.170 --> 03:52.200
that He was definitely a man who made lots of money

03:53.070 --> 03:54.200
by dharma.

03:55.110 --> 04:00.050
Also He was a son of a king, and He built this Dwarika

04:00.210 --> 04:03.040
out of gold.

04:03.160 --> 04:07.130
It is still there and people have found it,

04:08.120 --> 04:11.160
but under the sea.

04:12.230 --> 04:17.000
Thousands of years have passed, but still existed.

04:18.020 --> 04:21.200
Only because perhaps we belong to Shri Krishna,

04:22.070 --> 04:24.070
it is still existing.

04:24.210 --> 04:29.090
That’s what it is, because He was the one

04:29.220 --> 04:33.100
who was for satya first – truth.

04:34.030 --> 04:40.150
He was for truth, and He worked out everything

04:41.040 --> 04:44.210
on the principle of truth.

04:45.130 --> 04:49.040
Whatever was not truth, He tried to finish it off.

04:49.180 --> 04:56.080
Whatever was destructive, He tried to remove that;

04:56.240 --> 05:03.200
and He established Himself through truth only, truth only.

05:04.120 --> 05:08.190
He’s the one who represent the truth, absolute truth,

05:09.160 --> 05:14.030
and how the truth can prevail in everything.

05:18.110 --> 05:21.000
I’m just the opposite of Him because I don’t understand

05:21.130 --> 05:23.070
money at all,

05:23.220 --> 05:28.000
but He’s looking after that part in My life.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.160
I’m so hopelessly bad –

05:32.070 --> 05:36.240
I don’t understand banking, I don’t understand money,

05:37.150 --> 05:42.070
I can’t even count money. Now what can you say to that?

05:43.070 --> 05:45.240
But He’s there to look after,

05:46.140 --> 05:50.230
and I've never a dearth of money, never a dearth of any

05:51.240 --> 05:56.020
wealth, it’s all full of it.

05:57.020 --> 06:02.090
Also it comes through your sense of satisfaction.

06:03.130 --> 06:06.180
If you have that sense of satisfaction,

06:07.050 --> 06:11.230
you don’t look for money.

06:12.120 --> 06:16.160
What happened in your country that some people got money.

06:17.030 --> 06:21.030
If you got little money, then you get the taste of money.

06:21.200 --> 06:24.040
They’re not satisfied people.

06:24.170 --> 06:29.200
So like mad they went on spending on nonsensical things.

06:31.140 --> 06:34.180
It is something very much human.

06:35.090 --> 06:38.230
After your human evolution,

06:39.100 --> 06:43.060
after you have reached a certain state of enlightenment,

06:43.240 --> 06:50.240
then all these demeaning things like greed

06:52.080 --> 06:55.090
all disappear from your character.

06:55.090 --> 06:59.180
You don’t have that greed in you anymore

07:00.080 --> 07:05.010
and you become extremely a satisfied person.

07:05.140 --> 07:09.230
To you money is there, all right, but it’s not so important.

07:11.010 --> 07:19.130
It is just that you think don’t need it, and you’ll get it –

07:20.050 --> 07:23.240
all done by Shri Krishna all over, can you imagine?

07:24.110 --> 07:27.120
He’s doing all this, looking after you

07:28.000 --> 07:31.240
and helping you with money.

07:32.120 --> 07:35.210
We started Sahaja Yoga without a single pai.

07:36.100 --> 07:39.100
I don’t, never had any problem.

07:39.240 --> 07:47.090
So one thing, as Kubera He’s the supplier of wealth.

07:47.230 --> 07:51.020
He looks after people who don’t have money.

07:51.160 --> 07:55.060
He gives money to people who stand by truth,

07:55.220 --> 08:00.150
who enjoy the life of truth.

08:03.110 --> 08:15.180
It is His work that people enjoy wealth, otherwise they don’t.

08:16.220 --> 08:18.140
They have this much, they want to have more;

08:19.060 --> 08:21.150
that means they don’t enjoy the wealth.

08:22.020 --> 08:25.040
They have a little, they want to get much more. Why?

08:25.180 --> 08:30.090
Because they are not enjoying whatever they have.

08:30.210 --> 08:34.150
But after Self-realization you will see that you enjoy

08:35.050 --> 08:37.150
whatever you have.

08:38.020 --> 08:41.100
You enjoy it fully, absolutely,

08:41.210 --> 08:45.110
and you don’t hanker after something that is not there.

08:45.210 --> 08:48.020
Doesn’t matter if you don’t have.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.010
Many a times people have asked Me,

08:51.140 --> 08:56.150
“Mother, why not we have the puja of Krishna as Kubera?”

08:56.230 --> 08:58.120
I said, “All right.

08:58.230 --> 09:01.070
Just now everybody’s trying to become Kuber.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.160
Let them learn a lesson,

09:04.010 --> 09:07.170
and then we will have the puja of Kubera.”

09:08.020 --> 09:13.060
And that’s why today I’ve agreed to have this puja.

09:14.240 --> 09:19.120
Because now you have seen what happens if you have greed.

09:20.170 --> 09:24.150
You go on committing all kinds of sins,

09:24.240 --> 09:30.010
all kinds of wrong things which can destroy your country.

09:30.110 --> 09:33.240
Such a rich country has now become a poor country.

09:34.070 --> 09:36.160
Where is that money gone?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.050
They’re very clever.

09:38.140 --> 09:41.240
Somebody told Me today that this money with the insurance.

09:41.240 --> 09:44.120
“My God,” I said, “the law is such that

09:44.200 --> 09:46.230
you can’t get out that money.”

09:47.090 --> 09:51.080
Secondly they said that it is in offshore and all that.

09:51.230 --> 09:57.060
I said, “But see now, they were never afraid

09:58.190 --> 10:01.230
that they'll be caught up,

10:02.160 --> 10:06.040
and they continued for so many years.

10:07.140 --> 10:10.080
But I’m sure one day

10:10.150 --> 10:14.170
they'll all be exposed by Kubera Himself.”

10:15.100 --> 10:20.090
So today by worshipping Kubera what we are doing,

10:20.190 --> 10:26.080
we are going to establish, establish the truth of money,

10:27.000 --> 10:31.010
what lies behind the money,

10:35.160 --> 10:41.000
what is the point of having money.

10:41.060 --> 10:43.040
This country had money.

10:43.160 --> 10:48.160
As a result so many good people came here to work,

10:49.010 --> 10:52.070
and you had so many complementary things.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.180
You had lots of people who have complemented,

10:57.020 --> 11:01.000
because I think in certain things Americans were little less;

11:01.100 --> 11:05.080
not in intelligence, but in brilliance I think

11:05.150 --> 11:07.220
they were little bit lacking.

11:08.070 --> 11:11.050
So they got very brilliant people from abroad,

11:11.140 --> 11:16.180
and also they were very focused people,

11:17.010 --> 11:19.110
so they worked it out very well.

11:19.220 --> 11:24.040
Also they respected people who came with brains.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.220
So this is what happens when you forget

11:28.110 --> 11:32.010
that truth is the main point.

11:32.090 --> 11:37.020
If you don’t have the truth, no use having money.

11:37.120 --> 11:42.000
Because what you did was to go around with this thing,

11:42.080 --> 11:48.150
that thing, I mean all kinds of things, to just get money.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.170
The other day I was traveling through Las Vegas – last year.

11:55.020 --> 11:57.120
And when we stopped at that airport

11:58.030 --> 12:01.040
so many people walked into the aeroplane,

12:01.200 --> 12:03.190
and they all were looking as if somebody’s dead

12:04.070 --> 12:05.180
in their family or what has happened.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.060
First I couldn’t understand.

12:08.180 --> 12:12.120
Then said, “Mother, they have lost all their money.”

12:16.210 --> 12:20.110
So when they have money, they are jumping, next moment

12:20.220 --> 12:22.240
they are crying because they have lost the money.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.120
What’s the use of such a money

12:25.230 --> 12:30.010
which is so temporary, which is so useless?

12:30.130 --> 12:35.240
But that is human nature, to run after maya.

12:36.150 --> 12:43.010
And this is the quality of money, that it gives you maya.

12:43.200 --> 12:48.090
Maya like this, that they get a little money somehow;

12:48.230 --> 12:52.210
with that little money, they buy something.

12:53.080 --> 12:56.060
Then they think money is very important.

12:56.190 --> 12:59.100
You see, you can buy lots of things,

12:59.200 --> 13:02.110
you can buy cars, you can buy airplanes, this, that.

13:03.090 --> 13:08.120
So there is where maya plays on you, and you start running

13:08.240 --> 13:13.010
after that mad money which makes you mad.

13:13.120 --> 13:17.220
It’s nice that at this juncture they have discovered

13:18.130 --> 13:21.200
the falsehood of this maya money.

13:22.090 --> 13:26.020
And I am so happy that they were all handcuffed,

13:26.150 --> 13:32.010
and all their power of money was finished.

13:32.170 --> 13:37.120
So, this Kubera is working out all these tricks.

13:38.160 --> 13:44.080
Krishna is a very tricky, extremely tricky personality.

13:44.220 --> 13:50.240
He puts the tricks, every action after every action.

13:52.020 --> 13:54.080
Now money matters:

13:54.220 --> 14:00.010
He first befools you that you run after it,

14:01.040 --> 14:05.180
and then you just discover that it was stupidity.

14:06.040 --> 14:11.000
We have a story in our land, country, called “Sheikh Chili.”

14:11.110 --> 14:13.080
He got little money,

14:13.220 --> 14:19.060
and he got into the grab of this maya.

14:19.180 --> 14:22.220
So he thought, “I can do very well.”

14:23.070 --> 14:26.020
So he started dreaming as to what he should do.

14:26.170 --> 14:30.040
So he went and bought lots of eggs and he said,

14:30.130 --> 14:35.040
“Now these eggs will have little, little chicks which will grow,

14:35.130 --> 14:38.090
which will I’ll sell and I’ll so much money,”

14:38.170 --> 14:40.100
and it was like that he was talking.

14:41.050 --> 14:46.230
And while thinking about it in his mind went off to sleep,

14:47.090 --> 14:50.190
and then in his sleep he fell on the eggs

14:51.030 --> 14:54.080
and all the eggs broke.

14:54.190 --> 14:57.130
So the maya was over.

14:58.040 --> 15:01.100
This should happen early, but if it doesn’t happen

15:01.230 --> 15:06.100
then you end up in the jail or something like that.

15:06.240 --> 15:13.020
Sahaja Yoga is one thing which gives you a complete vision,

15:13.100 --> 15:16.070
complete vision of the destruction

15:16.190 --> 15:21.010
that can follow this maya business.

15:21.230 --> 15:26.070
It is something, such a insight

15:26.200 --> 15:29.100
that you don’t have to do anything with it.

15:30.040 --> 15:34.010
I'm different, I told you I don’t understand it at all.

15:34.120 --> 15:38.010
But even if you understand the value of money,

15:38.110 --> 15:42.020
even if you understand that money can bring

15:42.130 --> 15:47.090
lots of things to you, despite that you don’t look at it,

15:47.170 --> 15:53.160
just turn your face – that is the sign of a real Sahaja yogi.

15:53.230 --> 15:57.080
To him it doesn’t matter, temperamentally.

15:57.160 --> 16:02.020
It’s not that he does something for that or tells his mind, nothing;

16:02.130 --> 16:07.060
temperamentally he doesn’t care for money,

16:07.150 --> 16:11.140
just because he’s above it.

16:11.240 --> 16:15.170
The one who is above money is a real Sahaja yogi.

16:16.010 --> 16:19.200
The one who is engulfed in the nonsense

16:20.030 --> 16:24.020
and the maya of money is not a Sahaja yogi.

16:24.130 --> 16:26.130
Of course I have seen most of the Sahaja yogis

16:26.210 --> 16:29.000
are extremely honest, specially in the West.

16:29.140 --> 16:33.120
But in India there’s a disease: as you have some here viruses,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.100
we have certain viruses in India also.

16:37.240 --> 16:40.010
So they still go on running after money,

16:40.130 --> 16:42.130
to them money is important.

16:43.040 --> 16:46.220
But in the evolutionary process if you reach a certain state

16:47.090 --> 16:50.140
where you rise above your Nabhi Chakra,

16:51.020 --> 16:56.000
rise your Nabhi Chakra, then money’s not so important.

16:56.110 --> 16:58.170
It’s not so important.

17:03.040 --> 17:12.030
To Me, I find I cannot buy things unnecessarily.

17:13.190 --> 17:15.230
Of course I mean there are so many unnecessary things

17:16.130 --> 17:20.140
gathered, because you people give Me here presents, this that.

17:21.010 --> 17:26.000
But Myself, you’ll be amazed, I’m so nervous or I should say

17:26.080 --> 17:32.120
hesitant, or you may call it absolutely absent from the spot

17:32.230 --> 17:37.100
where they are doing any business, any purchasing.

17:39.030 --> 17:41.240
Come here and fix it please.

17:47.030 --> 17:50.170
It falls down, so I'm holding on!

17:55.100 --> 17:59.090
Correct, now all right.

18:01.190 --> 18:09.190
In the same way, Sahaja yogis have to fix their mind

18:17.090 --> 18:19.210
to their spirit,

18:20.110 --> 18:26.090
and enjoy the powers of your spirit, your own.

18:26.230 --> 18:33.060
That enjoyment once you get it, you don’t fall to your greed.

18:34.100 --> 18:36.030
This is something

18:36.200 --> 18:41.000
very, very simple,

18:41.180 --> 18:44.080
but sometimes you don’t do it.

18:44.220 --> 18:50.010
You get enamored by something, maybe a car,

18:50.130 --> 18:53.120
maybe aeroplane, I don’t know what – whatever it is.

18:54.010 --> 18:58.020
It’s a headache to have too many cars, isn’t it?

18:59.180 --> 19:01.140
But people have;

19:02.030 --> 19:04.060
they think by that people are impressed,

19:04.180 --> 19:07.150
and they think no end of themselves or not – nothing.

19:08.070 --> 19:11.220
If they are impressed, what is the use to us?

19:12.080 --> 19:14.200
What do you get out of it?

19:15.060 --> 19:20.120
Sahaja yogi has his own spirit to enjoy,

19:20.230 --> 19:22.100
more than anything else.

19:23.010 --> 19:24.220
He doesn’t want to possess anything.

19:25.090 --> 19:28.020
It’s a headache to possess things also.

19:28.160 --> 19:32.110
The other side of it is a Mahalakshmi.

19:33.100 --> 19:36.180
If that principle is within you, Mahalakshmi Principle,

19:37.070 --> 19:39.200
you’ll have never a problem of money.

19:40.070 --> 19:43.080
On the contrary, you’ll know how to stop it.

19:43.210 --> 19:47.220
So far as I am concerned,

19:48.080 --> 19:52.140
I get fed up of My Mahalakshmi Principle

19:53.020 --> 19:55.110
because I don’t know from where it works out,

19:55.230 --> 20:01.140
how it works out, without any effort.

20:03.140 --> 20:08.240
But the temperamentally, I have no interest at all,

20:09.120 --> 20:11.200
temperamentally.

20:12.120 --> 20:19.120
But it is the, I don’t know what is the cause of this effect.

20:21.050 --> 20:25.010
Now supposing I buy some small thing, just like that,

20:25.160 --> 20:29.220
it will sell at least ten times more.

20:30.110 --> 20:34.160
It will be of value at least ten times more, I don’t know how.

20:35.220 --> 20:41.130
It’s very surprising – automatically.

20:42.130 --> 20:49.000
I’ll buy something very small, then I find it’s very expensive.

20:49.190 --> 20:54.220
How it works, just must be miracles of Mahalakshmi, I think.

20:55.140 --> 20:59.160
So what I have to tell you is this,

21:00.070 --> 21:05.190
that you should not worry about your financial situations

21:06.040 --> 21:08.030
at all.

21:08.150 --> 21:10.090
Do not go on calculating,

21:10.210 --> 21:15.000
do not see how much money you have in the bank,

21:15.120 --> 21:17.000
what you have to do with your money,

21:17.110 --> 21:18.140
where you should invest.

21:19.040 --> 21:23.000
I have seen people going mad planning the whole thing.

21:23.170 --> 21:27.090
There’s no need to do that once you are a Sahaja yogi.

21:27.220 --> 21:31.000
It all works automatically.

21:31.110 --> 21:35.090
The greed is within you, just like any other disease.

21:35.230 --> 21:39.050
As you have diseases, greed is also there.

21:39.210 --> 21:43.140
As your diseases can get cured with Sahaja Yoga,

21:44.050 --> 21:52.230
your diseases, as much as your greed is, it vanishes.

21:54.060 --> 21:57.150
You don’t know what is greed is.

21:58.240 --> 22:03.120
The only way to counter-balance is to become extremely

22:03.230 --> 22:06.090
generous.

22:06.230 --> 22:11.020
If you are extremely generous, greed will run away.

22:11.150 --> 22:14.120
That may be another way of doing it.

22:15.110 --> 22:21.050
Supposing you get something in your house

22:23.040 --> 22:25.070
and you think it is too much.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.030
Not to get rid of it but just to think it’s too much,

22:29.030 --> 22:31.050
you should give it to someone; you just start thinking,

22:31.150 --> 22:33.050
whom can you give?

22:33.230 --> 22:35.240
And immediately you’ll remember,

22:36.100 --> 22:40.100
“Oh, that person doesn’t have this. Let me give him this.”

22:41.000 --> 22:44.160
And if you give him he’ll be so thankful, so thankful,

22:45.040 --> 22:48.110
and he’ll say all kinds of nice things to you

22:49.000 --> 22:53.000
which normally nobody would say to you, nobody.

22:56.230 --> 23:02.090
And it’s surprising how joy-giving it is,

23:02.210 --> 23:07.040
how people like your generosity.

23:07.160 --> 23:10.160
So you have to be generous, just generous;

23:11.030 --> 23:13.130
not with yourself, but with others.

23:14.020 --> 23:19.050
As much as possible, be generous.

23:20.110 --> 23:28.090
Generosity is very love-giving, one of the expressions

23:28.210 --> 23:31.090
of your love.

23:31.210 --> 23:35.190
Many a times it has happened with Me

23:36.070 --> 23:40.190
that I saw somebody needed something,

23:42.020 --> 23:44.080
and kept it in My mind.

23:44.240 --> 23:48.090
Then I bought that thing and gave it to that person.

23:49.010 --> 23:54.140
And the amount of love that person gave Me

23:55.020 --> 23:57.040
was thousand time more

23:57.180 --> 24:05.000
than what I would have got joy out of buying it, by that thing.

24:05.130 --> 24:09.100
It was so insipid for Me, but for him it was.... He told so

24:09.200 --> 24:14.040
many people, “Mother gave me this. Mother gave me.”

24:14.150 --> 24:16.220
I mean, I was surprised.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.180
Then they asked Me, “Mother, how did You give him?”

24:20.050 --> 24:22.170
I said, “Just out of love.”

24:23.050 --> 24:26.080
Many people took to Sahaja Yoga thinking,

24:26.170 --> 24:29.030
“What a generosity is!”

24:29.150 --> 24:33.220
So to be generous is the best way to live in this world.

24:35.100 --> 24:39.000
After all it’s a headache to have too many things.

24:39.110 --> 24:43.210
Better to get rid of them, but out of love.

24:44.060 --> 24:46.180
If you do that,

24:47.070 --> 24:52.080
you’ll be know how much they’ll be appreciative of you.

24:53.090 --> 25:00.200
Another thing is, to get greed of, to get rid of greed

25:02.000 --> 25:07.120
you should try to do some sort of a collective social work.

25:08.140 --> 25:13.150
Supposing you go to some place where lots of poor people

25:14.010 --> 25:18.110
are there, I tell you your greed will just drop out.

25:19.230 --> 25:21.240
You’ll be amazed how these people are living,

25:22.110 --> 25:24.030
in what conditions.

25:24.140 --> 25:28.110
“Why do I care for all the wealth and everything?”

25:29.090 --> 25:32.060
That will be just shocking.

25:32.170 --> 25:35.120
Sometimes, you see, you see people

25:36.230 --> 25:40.150
in India also in a very bad condition.

25:41.010 --> 25:43.170
Once I went to Calcutta

25:45.090 --> 25:50.200
and I was so – somehow or other you see by chance,

25:51.060 --> 25:56.040
I happened to be in places where people were very, in a very,

25:56.220 --> 26:01.150
very great poverty, even the children.

26:02.020 --> 26:05.210
And you’ll be amazed, for days together I wouldn’t eat My food.

26:06.100 --> 26:10.040
I was crying and not eating My food, I just didn’t know

26:10.140 --> 26:12.100
what to do.

26:12.210 --> 26:15.220
Because I felt, “What is this?

26:16.120 --> 26:19.120
Why these people are so poor?”

26:19.220 --> 26:23.120
And I was helpless so I was crying,

26:23.210 --> 26:29.100
that one day I should try to do something for them.

26:29.220 --> 26:34.010
It is really remarkable, at a very young age of Mine

26:34.230 --> 26:43.060
I started a leper home, I started a infirmary, a refugee home,

26:44.090 --> 26:46.120
all kinds of things.

26:48.080 --> 26:53.210
And I never even thought that whatever money I have,

26:55.070 --> 27:02.070
if I give to these people I may have to give up some things.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.140
I also sold some of My things,

27:06.010 --> 27:10.130
because so pleasure-giving I tell you, so pleasure-giving,

27:11.010 --> 27:14.160
so joy-giving to be generous.

27:15.140 --> 27:22.060
It is so pain in every way that you should be generous.

27:22.230 --> 27:25.170
That is the quality of Kubera.

27:26.080 --> 27:30.070
He’s an extremely generous personality,

27:31.080 --> 27:35.140
and that’s what’s personality you should be.

27:36.020 --> 27:39.150
So, I’ve seen that Sahaja yogis are very generous.

27:40.150 --> 27:46.010
So far nobody has told Me that somebody is a miserly fellow –

27:46.140 --> 27:49.100
so far, so far.

27:50.060 --> 27:55.240
But I’m sure one day will come when we’ll have people

27:56.100 --> 28:00.010
of very high quality.

28:00.120 --> 28:04.080
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t say like other cults say that

28:04.190 --> 28:10.130
you give up your clothes, you give up your family, you stay,

28:11.010 --> 28:16.240
stay in a forest or in a hut or anything – nothing of the kind.

28:17.100 --> 28:20.120
Don’t give up anything.

28:20.220 --> 28:24.220
You have to give up from your heart.

28:25.100 --> 28:27.220
Just it should happen in your personality;

28:28.070 --> 28:30.210
don’t have to give up.

28:31.090 --> 28:40.010
And if you have that well-built in spirituality,

28:41.020 --> 28:48.060
you’ll not even think of grabbing someone.

28:49.150 --> 28:52.100
On the contrary,

28:52.240 --> 28:55.190
you would like to give up everything.

28:56.060 --> 28:59.060
My father was even worse than Me, I should say.

29:00.110 --> 29:03.130
He always used to leave the house open, all doors open.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.140
He said, “No thief will come in if you keep the doors closed.”

29:09.000 --> 29:11.110
So one day a thief came

29:12.000 --> 29:15.160
and he took away his gramophone – in the old times,

29:16.010 --> 29:19.190
these big horn ones – he took away.

29:20.100 --> 29:23.160
The next day My father was sitting, very sad.

29:24.040 --> 29:25.100
So My mother asked him,

29:25.200 --> 29:27.130
“Why are you sad, because of the gramophone?”

29:28.010 --> 29:31.120
“No, I’m only sad because it seems he is a connoisseur of

29:31.240 --> 29:38.110
music, he has taken the gramophone but no records.”

29:39.110 --> 29:42.240
So My mother said, “All right, what should we do?

29:43.110 --> 29:46.060
Should we advertise in the newspaper that you take away

29:46.180 --> 29:49.210
your records?”

29:51.150 --> 29:57.070
I mean, it's such a beauty, that even after so many years

29:57.180 --> 30:00.220
I am telling you and you are enjoying.

30:01.080 --> 30:05.220
What a beautiful character it was of generosity.

30:06.100 --> 30:11.030
But if you force it through religion,

30:11.170 --> 30:16.000
through any such ideas that “you give up that, you give” –

30:16.130 --> 30:19.010
don’t have to give up.

30:19.140 --> 30:23.140
You give up from within.

30:24.090 --> 30:28.120
If you are not attached to it, you have given up.

30:28.240 --> 30:32.060
That much should be there and if you all enjoy your

30:32.200 --> 30:37.200
generosity and charity, nothing like it!

30:38.100 --> 30:42.200
I have known people who are very rich and all that,

30:43.090 --> 30:47.040
but they lack generosity.

30:47.160 --> 30:50.160
That is another quality of Kubera.

30:51.030 --> 30:54.190
He perhaps understand banking, perhaps.

30:55.060 --> 30:59.050
That time there were no banks but I think must be,

30:59.150 --> 31:02.030
because the way He manages banks, you know,

31:02.130 --> 31:06.080
it seems to Me that He’s sitting on top of them,

31:06.200 --> 31:11.010
and that’s why still in the banks there is no problem.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.210
I don’t know.

31:13.080 --> 31:19.090
But He’s a very clever person,

31:21.240 --> 31:23.220
very intelligent,

31:24.090 --> 31:26.110
very alert,

31:27.150 --> 31:32.150
which is important if you have to deal with money –

31:33.200 --> 31:38.050
though He was absolutely detached from money.

31:39.010 --> 31:42.020
And just see His life, what He did.

31:42.130 --> 31:47.040
He lived in childhood with His guru,

31:47.200 --> 31:49.160
and He used to take

31:50.040 --> 31:59.120
what you call the cows and herds outside in the jungles.

32:01.130 --> 32:07.130
That is how He lived in His childhood, and later on

32:10.020 --> 32:14.230
He was playing with the boys

32:15.080 --> 32:19.230
who were looking after the cows in a very,

32:20.130 --> 32:23.070
I mean, ordinary family.

32:27.050 --> 32:30.120
He never hankered after money.

32:31.090 --> 32:32.230
He used to steal,

32:34.220 --> 32:40.020
used to steal the butter,

32:40.210 --> 32:46.120
because these ladies used to sell these to Kamsa’s

32:50.120 --> 32:53.050
military people.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.100
So He used to eat that,

32:56.200 --> 33:00.030
so that this lady should not give it to them.

33:00.170 --> 33:04.090
Just imagine, such a little boy like Him.

33:04.210 --> 33:11.110
So actually, how He was teaching them a lesson.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.210
Those ladies were greedy, and wanted to give that

33:16.090 --> 33:18.220
to these horrible soldiers,

33:19.080 --> 33:24.070
and He would eat all that butter Himself.

33:24.180 --> 33:27.120
In everything that He did,

33:28.000 --> 33:33.150
what you see is extreme generosity, extreme generosity.

33:35.000 --> 33:40.020
With all His intelligence He, He was so good.

33:44.240 --> 33:48.200
And He killed

33:52.230 --> 33:56.210
His own uncle, I should say;

33:58.190 --> 34:01.090
but for Him it is, was not important,

34:02.090 --> 34:05.160
so-called relations were not important.

34:06.130 --> 34:09.160
But what you see in our India specially,

34:10.040 --> 34:12.180
that relations are very important.

34:13.040 --> 34:17.130
The father is a thief, his son is thief, his grandson is a thief,

34:17.220 --> 34:22.090
all of them are thieves – can you imagine?

34:23.060 --> 34:28.090
I haven’t seen in a family if there’s one person who is a thief,

34:28.190 --> 34:33.010
any one his progeny are honest.

34:33.120 --> 34:38.170
It’s a very funny thing, but such greed crawls into their minds

34:39.170 --> 34:43.150
that they don’t think is important.

34:44.030 --> 34:49.150
They just think that stealing is the only way one can live.

34:50.050 --> 34:54.190
Though in India there are people who are extremely honest.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.080
I have seen our servants,

34:56.220 --> 34:59.180
they never steal anything, nothing, never.

35:00.140 --> 35:02.210
I don’t know, they have no reasoning for it,

35:03.070 --> 35:05.050
it’s a matter of habit.

35:05.140 --> 35:10.220
They never steal anything – very surprising.

35:14.030 --> 35:16.170
Why, why don’t they steal?

35:17.150 --> 35:22.130
They’re happy with their lives, they don’t want to change it.

35:22.220 --> 35:28.010
They don’t want to have these horrible things

35:28.140 --> 35:30.190
that can put them in jail.

35:31.040 --> 35:33.090
But they don’t know,

35:33.170 --> 35:38.000
they don’t even think about it; just they just don’t do it.

35:39.000 --> 35:44.120
Why, because they have a sense of shame.

35:45.020 --> 35:48.230
In the poorer peoples, sense of shame is very,

35:49.070 --> 35:51.010
very developed.

35:51.100 --> 35:59.050
In that society they have a great respect for people who are

35:59.140 --> 36:02.040
honest, and they are all honest.

36:02.200 --> 36:06.240
One of them may be not,

36:07.100 --> 36:10.240
but they have no respect for such a person,

36:11.140 --> 36:16.210
because they think self-respect is the biggest thing.

36:17.040 --> 36:20.090
Can you imagine these poor people?

36:20.200 --> 36:24.120
They have food once a day,

36:24.220 --> 36:28.110
but to them their self-respect is above everything.

36:28.220 --> 36:34.190
So the third solution for this kind of a nonsensical greed is

36:35.200 --> 36:38.230
your self-respect.

36:39.080 --> 36:41.140
Why should you steal,

36:41.240 --> 36:44.070
why should you have anything that is stolen,

36:44.200 --> 36:46.190
or why should you have anything that belongs

36:47.030 --> 36:49.140
to another person?

36:50.060 --> 36:52.170
If you have that self-respect within you,

36:53.030 --> 36:58.080
you won’t touch anything that is not yours.

36:59.160 --> 37:02.210
When the servants can do that, why not people

37:03.070 --> 37:07.060
who are not that badly off?

37:07.170 --> 37:13.030
It is a temperament of a higher level, I think,

37:13.150 --> 37:16.050
which they develop, where their self-respect

37:16.170 --> 37:21.020
is much more important than all kinds of

37:21.120 --> 37:25.120
other things that may satisfy their greed.

37:25.230 --> 37:31.010
But one thing about greed is, it is never satisfied.

37:31.120 --> 37:34.000
It is never satisfied.

37:34.110 --> 37:37.000
I’ve seen people who were very rich once upon a time,

37:37.100 --> 37:39.190
became very, very poor.

37:40.080 --> 37:43.070
So to them life has become hell.

37:43.190 --> 37:49.050
They can’t live with, without their great,

37:50.160 --> 37:55.140
I should say, pomp and show,

37:56.010 --> 37:59.020
but they don’t understand that it was false.

37:59.170 --> 38:04.100
They just go on feeling extremely

38:05.110 --> 38:09.150
downtrodden when they lose their money.

38:10.170 --> 38:14.150
Then there are people who want to have money;

38:15.010 --> 38:21.000
they’ll do anything but get money.

38:21.120 --> 38:27.150
It’s a very funny thing, but also power is the same as that.

38:28.020 --> 38:30.150
If you have your own powers,

38:31.000 --> 38:33.160
you don’t hanker after these powers.

38:33.160 --> 38:35.230
But they want to have power because

38:36.070 --> 38:40.150
they want to have money, and they get power with money –

38:40.230 --> 38:42.120
can you imagine?

38:42.220 --> 38:45.220
Where are human beings, at what level?

38:46.080 --> 38:49.040
At what level of evolution they are?

38:49.130 --> 38:54.240
They are going round and round the circle of this money.

38:55.150 --> 38:58.190
This is Nabhi Chakra

38:59.050 --> 39:01.090
which has to improve,

39:01.170 --> 39:04.190
which gives you satisfaction.

39:05.060 --> 39:08.020
If your Nabhi Chakra is satisfied,

39:08.120 --> 39:12.100
you have achieved the state of Kubera.

39:12.200 --> 39:16.000
That’s very important, to see

39:16.100 --> 39:20.230
that your Nabhi should be satisfied.

39:22.030 --> 39:25.070
There are so many other kinds of things we have,

39:25.190 --> 39:29.110
but I think now the worst is this greed.

39:29.220 --> 39:34.130
And this, if it is managed somehow or other,

39:34.220 --> 39:37.130
brought to its own level,

39:37.230 --> 39:41.080
then I think world will improve very much.

39:41.080 --> 39:43.010
May God bless you.
