00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.230
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.350
Definitely it is evident today

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.269
that you have come here all the way in the rain

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.310
to seek the truth, that you are real seekers.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.869
And the real seekers

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.270
will find the real way.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.168
Whatever they may do, whatever wrong path they may take,

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:42.354
they may identify themselves with wrong things also,

00:00:42.555 --> 00:00:45.282
and may oppose in the beginning the truth,

00:00:45.483 --> 00:00:50.870
but ultimately they will all find the real path,

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.205
as long as they do not try to deceive themselves.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.628
The awakening of the Kundalini

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.309
is not a new thing as you people may be thinking.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.909
It has been done since

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.821
sixteenth century back,

00:01:19.022 --> 00:01:24.559
when it is said Indra, the God King,

00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:27.189
was given Realization.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.164
So you can imagine,

00:01:29.365 --> 00:01:32.583
that is called as Siddhendra,

00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:38.310
means the Indra first made a hole here.

00:01:38.968 --> 00:01:42.869
And there’s a place where it was done in India.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.716
It’s a very ancient thing,

00:01:44.884 --> 00:01:47.189
and at the time of Rama also,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.466
there was a fellow called Nachiketa

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:54.218
who came to Rama’s father-in-law, Janaka,

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:59.060
and asked Him if he could get his Self Realization.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.389
And the father-in-law said that

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.989
“You can ask anything but not for your Realization.”

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.459
He said, “No, I don’t want anything else but Realization”.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.966
And they say that He put him to test, many a times, for years,

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:18.269
and then he was the first who got Realization,

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:21.245
at the time of Shri Rama.

00:02:22.027 --> 00:02:28.084
It is very interesting that how this system of Self Realization,

00:02:28.286 --> 00:02:32.398
was kept more or less exclusive, and rather secretive,

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.480
because the people would like always

00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:40.780
to use this method to make some money out of it;

00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:44.551
that they would not respect the reality,

00:02:44.752 --> 00:02:49.769
and would learn, say about your chakras, Kundalini,

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.390
this, that, few words and start selling books

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.790
or posing that they are born again,

00:02:56.973 --> 00:02:59.108
and impressing others with it,

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.268
and try to make some cults or some sort of groups,

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.829
just forming into some falsehood.

00:03:08.258 --> 00:03:11.669
And that is the reason this was kept quite a secret.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.269
But on the right hand side of the seeking,

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:20.269
they tried to find out the ways and methods

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:25.029
how to initiate the elements within us, the casual of elements,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.989
first to initiate the causal of the elements,

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.429
by which we could control the elements for our own purpose.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.789
This was one way where they called it as the Yagnya and all that.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.006
And that’s how the Vedas were written.

00:03:39.207 --> 00:03:42.469
Veda means vida, means to know.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.123
These were written to say that you have to know.

00:03:46.324 --> 00:03:49.350
And at the very beginning of the Vedas, it is written

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.492
that after reading this book, throughout,

00:03:52.693 --> 00:03:56.124
if you have not known the truth,

00:03:56.267 --> 00:03:59.149
it is of no use to you.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.909
The very first stanza says so.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.780
So the whole thing was done with that idea,

00:04:05.982 --> 00:04:09.097
and in the ancient country of India,

00:04:09.298 --> 00:04:11.433
they started working on the right side

00:04:11.634 --> 00:04:15.158
to know this subtle body

00:04:15.373 --> 00:04:18.654
or the subtle Deities of all the elements

00:04:18.855 --> 00:04:22.230
so that they could master the elements; this was first idea.

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:27.183
On the left hand side, they started another kind of a search,

00:04:27.384 --> 00:04:30.270
in believing that there is God,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.910
and we have to ask the help of God.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.243
And they started praying,

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.509
first to Primordial Mother,

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.869
because in every religion there is a place for the Mother.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.989
There’s no religion which does not believe in the Primordial Mother.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.910
You can say that at the time of Mohammed Sahib,

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.629
He didn’t talk much about it, because the time was such.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.699
But His own daughter

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.937
was an incarnation of the Primordial Mother,

00:05:00.128 --> 00:05:01.909
whose name was Fatima Bi.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.401
And the two sons that were born to Her, are the sons

00:05:06.603 --> 00:05:12.636
who came on this earth also as Mahavira and Buddha.

00:05:12.837 --> 00:05:14.863
And they were born even earlier.

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:17.515
Like that, they were born again and again,

00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:21.870
as these two elements, as the disciples, as two disciples.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.531
And you can see if you read their life,

00:05:25.732 --> 00:05:29.029
their character, their behavior, you’ll be surprised,

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.669
how these two characters have been born again and again,

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.110
in different times, to suggest two personalities

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.389
of two types, who have been seeking God,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.032
and who have been trying to understand God

00:05:44.233 --> 00:05:46.591
through their personality as disciples;

00:05:46.793 --> 00:05:50.069
and how they reached a conclusion

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:55.030
after taking a kind of a position in life.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.830
Now for example Buddha preached that

00:05:58.031 --> 00:06:00.629
there should be complete non-violence,

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.096
and also Mahavira said so, there should be non-violence.

00:06:05.297 --> 00:06:07.630
But they carried it to such an extent.

00:06:07.831 --> 00:06:11.401
that Mahavira’s disciples started saving the bugs.

00:06:11.602 --> 00:06:14.713
They would get some bugs from the village,

00:06:14.968 --> 00:06:16.737
put them in a hut

00:06:16.938 --> 00:06:20.949
and put a Brahmin inside that – fanaticism at that stage -

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.050
and the bugs would eat,

00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:29.469
or take, take out the blood of that poor brahmin,

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:32.789
and when they would be all filled with blood,

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.829
then they would give money to this brahmin.

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.549
Such extreme vegetarianism or extreme type of ahinsa!

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.468
Or another type of Buddha’s ahinsa that started

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.269
that Buddha was not the one who was a vegetarian,

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:49.990
because He died, at the end you know that,

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.189
He ate the meat of a boar which was not properly cooked.

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:58.412
So this kind of extreme type of

00:06:58.613 --> 00:07:02.468
food-oriented religion started out of them,

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.088
so they got themselves born again,

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.427
as Hassan and Hussein and (unclear)

00:07:12.025 --> 00:07:15.188
that when it come to righteousness,

00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:19.081
when it comes to the (fight) for righteousness, you have to fight.

00:07:19.282 --> 00:07:21.572
That time the one who doesn't fight

00:07:21.794 --> 00:07:25.509
is not a person who is a religious person.

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:32.377
So the idea of all these people was in such a way

00:07:32.578 --> 00:07:37.527
that the time at that period was such and such,

00:07:37.728 --> 00:07:41.829
and at that period this was the proper thing to be done.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.910
Now we can see the example of Christ is.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.782
Christ came at a time

00:07:46.983 --> 00:07:50.629
where the Son of God had to manifest.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:55.310
And He came at a time where He had to forgive,

00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:01.430
and He had to show to people how stupid they were, to crucify Him,

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:06.430
so that they could repent for what stupidity they have done.

00:08:06.631 --> 00:08:08.790
And that’s how He came on this earth.

00:08:09.037 --> 00:08:11.640
But when He will come again,

00:08:11.897 --> 00:08:14.669
He’s not going to come in that way.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:17.444
The Second Advent of Christ,

00:08:17.573 --> 00:08:20.829
is going to be a very serious one.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:25.110
When He will come, He will have eleven destroying powers.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.469
With that He will destroy all that is useless,

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.030
all that has gone wasted, all those fanatics

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.726
or "Whom they'll call Christ, Christ&gt;&gt;, I won’t know,

00:08:34.927 --> 00:08:36.390
He’s told that, very well.

00:08:36.591 --> 00:08:39.830
All these things He’s going to absolutely finish off.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.750
And those who are realized souls,

00:08:43.951 --> 00:08:47.269
who have entered into the Kingdom of God, will be only saved.

00:08:47.469 --> 00:08:51.030
And this is what is described in all the Scriptures.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.417
Of course somebody calls them, say Islam calls it “Mahdi”

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:58.110
in India He is called as “Kalki”,

00:08:58.311 --> 00:09:01.790
in the Bible He is called as “the Christ on the white horse”.

00:09:01.991 --> 00:09:03.590
He is called by various names,

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:06.310
but it is definite that He is going to come,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.955
and when He comes,

00:09:08.156 --> 00:09:12.884
then He is not going to bother as to tell you, and convince you,

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:18.104
and to counsel you or to redeem you and give you Realization.

00:09:18.398 --> 00:09:21.469
That time, He is not going to bother about it.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.430
He is going to come in pure destructive form,

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.241
where He will destroy all that is useless.

00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:31.953
And to understand this, if you see
the Sistine Chapel of Michelangelo,

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:35.110
you can see Him clearly standing, at the Agnya chakra,

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.069
with a robust body, throwing people up and down.

00:09:38.271 --> 00:09:40.790
Those who call, “Christ, Christ”, He throws them down,

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:45.757
because they did not do anything what Christ has asked for.

00:09:46.469 --> 00:09:48.368
Now the people should know

00:09:48.569 --> 00:09:51.630
what we have got out of anything whatsoever.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.350
You may be identified with any cult, with any idea,

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:57.310
with any group, or anything,

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:00.828
but always must know what you have you got out of it.

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:05.189
For example, I would say for Christians it is necessary to know

00:10:05.469 --> 00:10:08.190
that Christ has said a very strong thing,

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:11.950
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.790
Let us find out, do we have innocent eyes?

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.108
If we don’t, we are not Christians.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:21.310
How do we have innocent eyes?

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:24.468
How do we develop our innocence, is the problem.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:28.749
And to develop our innocence we have to awaken the Kundalini.

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.935
When the Kundalini is awakened, the first center

00:10:31.136 --> 00:10:34.269
of innocence is awakened.

00:10:34.469 --> 00:10:39.789
At that time all the excretion work of the body just stops,

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:46.484
and this center of Mooladhara, informs the Kundalini,

00:10:46.685 --> 00:10:50.750
that “There is somebody who knows the job and You can rise.”

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.030
Then only the Kundalini rises.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:57.251
This center of innocence is first awakened within us.

00:10:57.453 --> 00:11:02.789
If this center finds that the person is anti-God,

00:11:02.991 --> 00:11:05.110
he is anti-Christ,

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.590
he is a man who is a devil, or any sort of a thing,

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.350
it just does not allow the Kundalini to rise.

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:15.590
I have seen people with absolute frozen Kundalini;

00:11:15.791 --> 00:11:19.230
I have seen people who have nothing to do with Kundalini,

00:11:19.469 --> 00:11:21.395
we can say they are just like devils

00:11:21.596 --> 00:11:25.429
and they have no way that they can be realized.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:29.015
But ninety-nine percent people in this world

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:32.670
are excellent people, good people,

00:11:32.872 --> 00:11:35.150
and out of them I think at least

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:38.189
thirty to forty percent people are seeking God.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:42.790
Not all; some are seeking money, some are seeking power

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.150
and some are seeking some personal indulgences.

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.070
But there are definitely true seekers on this earth,

00:11:50.271 --> 00:11:54.197
and this thirty percent people are, or forty percent people,

00:11:54.398 --> 00:11:57.789
are the most important people from the God’s point of view.

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.590
You might be anything. You might be having any organization,

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:04.269
you might be having any position in life,

00:12:04.469 --> 00:12:08.030
you might be any great personality, makes no difference to God.

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.469
What is important is that are you seeking?

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.350
If you’re not, the door will be opened has been promised.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:17.870
But if you think you have already achieved it

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.909
and that you are there, how can it be worked out?

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:25.430
So one has to be humble about it, and allow the Kundalini to rise

00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:29.318
in Its own glory, giving you your real beauty.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:34.189
Now the thing we have to know that

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:39.469
as the Kundalini ascends, we also start getting powers.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.269
The first power is that of innocence.

00:12:43.469 --> 00:12:48.577
Innocence has a power above all other powers.

00:12:48.778 --> 00:12:50.789
It’s the most powerful thing,

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.572
but in the human beings it takes time

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:57.025
for innocence to be awakened in the full way.

00:12:57.226 --> 00:13:00.549
It takes time. As a child they have the innocence;

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:03.710
and in childhood, if they get their awakening

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:06.269
that’s the best thing that can happen to human beings

00:13:06.469 --> 00:13:09.790
that in the childhood only they become, get their Realization.

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.909
But as soon as you start growing

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:16.029
your attention starts going either to the left or to the right.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.990
You start indulging into all kinds of things

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.070
as far as your sex is concerned,

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.878
as far as your seeking is concerned,

00:13:24.079 --> 00:13:27.929
and you then jump on to some sort of a wrong thing

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.792
which you should not have done.

00:13:29.993 --> 00:13:32.642
And that’s how the first center gets lost.

00:13:32.843 --> 00:13:36.910
An innocent person is looked after by angels.

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:40.092
Such a person has no fear of anything.

00:13:40.294 --> 00:13:44.400
He’s not bothered, he’s never violent, he’s never hasty,

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.549
he’s never in a temper, he’s so peaceful,

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:51.990
and he knows that what he is doing is the right thing.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.468
Such a person stands by righteousness.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.789
Like you can see in the life of Christ is a very good example

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:04.395
that when Mary Magdalene was stoned by people, He stood up,

00:14:04.597 --> 00:14:07.629
and He said, “Among you who has done no sin

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:09.469
can throw the stone at her.”

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:12.630
Actually Christ had nothing to do with a prostitute.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.390
He had no relationship of any kind with her.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.469
She is a prostitute and He is the Son of God.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:24.469
But at that time He did feel that she has a right to exist,

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:27.550
because those who are stoning her

00:14:27.751 --> 00:14:30.230
are the people who have committed also sins.

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:34.269
Only she is a person who’s exposed, and He stood by her.

00:14:34.529 --> 00:14:37.042
And that is what happens to a person who is innocent

00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:38.428
he is fearless.

00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:40.350
He has no fear of anything,

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:44.870
because he knows that he stands on truth and on innocence.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:51.070
Such a person also has a capacity to bear up lots of nonsense,

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:55.990
to laugh at lots of tortures and troubles people bestow upon him.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.643
And the greatest thing of innocence is,

00:14:58.889 --> 00:15:00.749
that it gives you discretion.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:04.444
Such a person is immensely discreet. He’s so wise.

00:15:04.645 --> 00:15:07.829
He may be a little child, he may be a grown-up person,

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.949
he may be a villager, he might be educated,

00:15:11.151 --> 00:15:14.229
he might be uneducated, but he’s so wise

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:18.476
that he sees what is right and what is righteous.

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.269
And this is the greatest quality of an innocent person,

00:15:22.469 --> 00:15:25.150
that he’s very discreet about everything.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:29.710
His discretion is just like a straight forward hit.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.989
He doesn’t have to think, he doesn’t have to bother.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:36.469
Whatever he decides is absolute discreet,

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.549
and he doesn’t have to have choices.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.980
He doesn’t go on choosing people, he doesn’t go on choosing things.

00:15:42.181 --> 00:15:44.109
He said, “This is the thing” – finished.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:47.269
So, such a person becomes absolutely dynamic

00:15:47.469 --> 00:15:51.269
because he doesn’t waste any energy, he doesn’t waste his brains,

00:15:51.469 --> 00:15:54.350
he doesn’t waste his arguments with anyone.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.110
If he thinks a person is worth arguing, he’ll argue,

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:00.869
otherwise he’ll say, “All right, you are clever. Go ahead.”

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:05.379
This is the understanding of a person,

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:07.350
who is completely discreet.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:11.070
Like there was a very big joke about it, that

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:15.630
there was a man who was going up the road,

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:20.629
up the stairs, and another one was coming downstairs.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:24.870
The one who was going up the road was a wise man

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.669
and the one who was coming down was not a wise man.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:30.989
So he tried to be aggressive, so, and he told him

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:35.749
that “I will not move for you, because I don’t move for fools.”

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:40.410
So the other one moved on one side and he said, “I do.”

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.950
Meaning, “I move out for fools,”

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:46.268
you see, but he said, “I do.” And he moved out.

00:16:46.469 --> 00:16:50.589
So he has such a discretion – how far to go and how far not to go.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:52.830
Now, I will give you an example how

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.590
in nature you can find this very easily.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:58.949
See, the root has a little root cap.

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:01.110
It’s a very, very small minute thing,

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:03.269
you have to see through the microscope.

00:17:03.469 --> 00:17:06.195
Now this root cap is a wise thing.

00:17:06.469 --> 00:17:09.799
It goes in the soil, it sees there are some stones,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.588
so it goes around the stones.

00:17:11.789 --> 00:17:14.868
Then it finds there are boulders. It goes around the boulders.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:17.405
It has to find its way, so it's not bothered.

00:17:17.607 --> 00:17:19.309
“You are a boulder? All right, doesn’t matter,

00:17:19.517 --> 00:17:20.943
I am not going to fight with you.”

00:17:21.144 --> 00:17:24.539
It passes through that, it goes directly

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:27.550
to that place where it has to arrive,

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:31.080
and when it reaches that place, when he arrives that place,

00:17:31.282 --> 00:17:34.802
what happens, he finds that he has tied up these boulders

00:17:35.004 --> 00:17:38.510
around himself to support the whole tree.

00:17:39.306 --> 00:17:44.190
This is the wisdom of a little bit, small little cell

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.310
which is the root-end.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.430
So you can imagine how much there is wisdom

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:55.269
in a little cell like that.

00:17:55.469 --> 00:17:58.430
And God has given us such a good brain

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:00.870
and if we do not have discretion

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:03.269
we are like people who are blind,

00:18:03.469 --> 00:18:06.909
who walk without knowing where they have to go.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:13.190
So the first power of your innocence is awakened.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.030
Innocent men cannot be harmed.

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:20.268
Those who try to harm the innocent men are harmed ultimately.

00:18:20.469 --> 00:18:25.070
They are very severely harmed, and it is amazing sometimes

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:28.710
that the harm can be too much, too severe

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.830
and that’s why the compassion of Christ thought of it,

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:34.590
and He said, “Oh God, please forgive them,

00:18:34.791 --> 00:18:37.230
for they do not know what they are doing.”

00:18:37.469 --> 00:18:39.469
Because it could have been that

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.430
with the Father who is so wrathful,

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.269
they would have been all destroyed completely.

00:18:44.469 --> 00:18:47.268
So the way He said, “Forgive them,

00:18:47.469 --> 00:18:49.830
because I do not want

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.270
that these people, who are ignorant people,

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:55.910
who have tortured Me like this, should be destroyed.”

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:59.920
This is the sign of innocence.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:05.509
Then the second chakra, when it is awaken within you,

00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:11.181
you have a special quality of creativity.

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:14.269
Because when the second chakra is awaken,

00:19:14.469 --> 00:19:18.358
you are actually thoughtless, there’s no thought in your mind.

00:19:18.559 --> 00:19:23.049
So you start looking at anything, without thinking.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:28.230
You start looking at anything that is created

00:19:28.469 --> 00:19:31.749
without any ripple of thought in your mind.

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:36.029
Like all that is created round the lake of your mind

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:42.398
is completely reflected in that ripple-less lake,

00:19:42.599 --> 00:19:48.269
and you see the complete reflection of that creation,

00:19:48.469 --> 00:19:53.269
as well as the joy that is bubbling in that creation.

00:19:53.469 --> 00:19:56.269
So your creativity becomes tremendous.

00:19:56.469 --> 00:19:59.852
You start seeing things, but not thinking about it.

00:20:00.053 --> 00:20:03.269
Now, see if you come to this hall,

00:20:03.469 --> 00:20:05.869
and you start seeing something, you like it,

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.790
then you start thinking, “Oh God, this is a beautiful thing,

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:12.269
but how much it must have cost? And now how old it is?

00:20:12.469 --> 00:20:15.469
Is it going to last or not? Is it insured or not?”

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:17.550
All sorts of funny ideas will come to you,

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:19.734
and you’ll never enjoy what it is.

00:20:19.935 --> 00:20:22.349
But supposing you have no thought about it,

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.269
you just watch it, you just see it.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:28.350
What happens? The creation that of the artist

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.389
who has created this beautiful thing,

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.109
the joy of that creation that the artist had -

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.567
who might be dead now - you start enjoying that joy.

00:20:36.768 --> 00:20:41.567
The whole thing can be filled in you with that bubbling joy

00:20:41.768 --> 00:20:45.401
that he wanted to put there with his own heart.

00:20:45.602 --> 00:20:48.510
And that’s what happens because there is no thought.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.269
So the creativity becomes tremendous.

00:20:51.469 --> 00:20:54.710
But it’s not only that the creativity is tremendous,

00:20:54.911 --> 00:20:56.469
but your techniques even.

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.910
For example, a musician can become a tremendous musician.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:04.790
People who have never done any work, can become extremely powerful.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.869
We have somebody here from India.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:09.668
The other day he was telling people,

00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:12.047
because he gave one of the lectures,

00:21:12.248 --> 00:21:14.696
that “I had never seen what is wood is.

00:21:14.897 --> 00:21:18.269
I did not know what was teak, what was other wood and all that.”

00:21:18.469 --> 00:21:20.269
And he had no job when he came to Me.

00:21:20.469 --> 00:21:22.960
And he said, “Now, after Realization what job should I take?”

00:21:23.161 --> 00:21:25.672
I said, “You take to interior decoration”, and he got a shock.

00:21:25.873 --> 00:21:27.469
He said, “I don’t know what (to do).

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:29.337
How am I to take interior decoration?”

00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:31.750
I said, “You can start feeling the vibrations.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.630
You just do it on the basis on vibrations.”

00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:37.469
And he did it, and he made a big money out of it,

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:39.590
because as I told you the other day,

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:42.710
whatever is absolutely beautiful you think,

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.550
has nothing in it but has vibrations.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:48.869
It has a coefficient which gives you vibrations.

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.510
Like Mona Lisa now. We like her, Mona Lisa.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.109
According to modern standards she cannot be a beauty

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:57.330
because she was a very plump lady, an elderly lady.

00:21:57.531 --> 00:22:01.030
But today also, if you go there, you cannot see her painting,

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:04.190
it’s so crowded, everybody’s anxious to see Mona Lisa.

00:22:04.469 --> 00:22:06.269
And if you go and feel the vibrations,

00:22:06.469 --> 00:22:08.269
from distance you’ll get vibrations,

00:22:08.469 --> 00:22:12.270
because the coefficients of her body, face and everything

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:15.469
is made so well, that you get the vibrations.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:19.468
Now people are very anxious to create new ideas,

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.757
new type of things, and these,

00:22:21.958 --> 00:22:24.184
but these things do not sell

00:22:24.385 --> 00:22:27.910
and even if they sell temporarily, they have no eternal values.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:31.790
So the people with this chakra enlightened,

00:22:32.030 --> 00:22:37.405
start creating things of very eternal values,

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.718
of universal values.

00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:42.933
Anywhere you take such a thing, you will take it to India,

00:22:43.134 --> 00:22:46.510
you take it to China, you take it to Japan or you take it to America

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.469
anywhere, any human being who sees that,

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:54.269
sees the beauty of the Spirit,

00:22:54.469 --> 00:22:57.230
because it gives you joy in your Spirit.

00:22:57.469 --> 00:23:01.269
So the pure art is produced (through you).

00:23:01.469 --> 00:23:02.690
That’s the purity,

00:23:02.891 --> 00:23:05.750
or I would say the holy art is produced through you.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:09.704
When you start producing that holy art, then you should believe

00:23:09.905 --> 00:23:14.269
that you have got an enlightenment on that chakra.

00:23:14.469 --> 00:23:16.481
This chakra has another capacity,

00:23:16.682 --> 00:23:20.362
to transform your fat, for the use of your brain.

00:23:20.563 --> 00:23:24.350
And it works very hard for that, when you start thinking too much.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:26.392
And by that over thinking,

00:23:26.593 --> 00:23:29.036
what happens, that you develop all the diseases

00:23:29.237 --> 00:23:31.990
of the organs which it has to look after.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.230
Like, it has to look after the liver,

00:23:34.469 --> 00:23:37.269
it has to look after the pancreas, it has to look after the spleen,

00:23:37.469 --> 00:23:41.470
it has to look after the parts of the intestine and the uterus.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:45.437
So what happens that when you use this chakra

00:23:45.638 --> 00:23:49.349
only for the use of thinking and thinking and thinking,

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.830
all these things go out of order.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:56.085
And one by one you start developing diseases like diabetes,

00:23:56.286 --> 00:24:00.904
and then you start developing diseases of the stomach,

00:24:01.105 --> 00:24:04.541
and sometimes the spleen, and all other diseases

00:24:04.742 --> 00:24:06.769
which are very dangerous, that the,

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.666
as you can call the blood cancer and all those things,

00:24:09.867 --> 00:24:12.229
out of this kind of mad thinking.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.510
Now to tell you that you shouldn’t think too much,

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.902
you shouldn’t bother too much, you should not be wobbly,

00:24:19.103 --> 00:24:21.696
you should take things easy, be light-hearted,

00:24:21.897 --> 00:24:23.744
is not possible in the modern times

00:24:23.896 --> 00:24:25.789
because we are slaves of the watch.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:30.149
But what happens, that when you get Realization,

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:32.670
your thinking process becomes regulated.

00:24:32.910 --> 00:24:34.590
You only think when you have to think.

00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:37.269
You just go on thinking, thinking, like horns coming out.

00:24:37.469 --> 00:24:40.589
You don’t think like that. You only think when you have to think.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:44.628
And whatever you think comes from you inspiration as such.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:48.590
Now for time, you see, My watch is always out of order.

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:53.468
I deliberately keep it out of order, because the time is

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:57.510
in your hands.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.310
Supposing these people will hurry Me up too much,

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.612
“Mother we have go now, we’ll miss
the plane, this thing, that thing.”

00:25:03.813 --> 00:25:05.601
I said, “All right, if you say I’ll go.”

00:25:05.802 --> 00:25:07.498
I go to the airport

00:25:07.699 --> 00:25:09.909
and there they find the plane is three hours late.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.269
Then they said, “Mother, why didn’t you tell us?”

00:25:12.469 --> 00:25:14.590
I said, “I was telling you, no need to hurry up.

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:16.349
Why didn’t you telephone and find out?

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.710
If you had telephoned, we would not have been there earlier.”

00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:22.726
So you see, you start seeing

00:25:22.927 --> 00:25:27.399
that this time is best for this, this time is best for that.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.881
You don’t have to become a slave of the watch.

00:25:30.082 --> 00:25:32.417
Like this, people become such slaves

00:25:32.618 --> 00:25:37.469
that they arrive at a point where there can be

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:39.710
some sort of a wrong thing happening

00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:43.469
or maybe that you reach the place
and you have to wait for four hours,

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:47.496
you have to do all kinds of arrangements

00:25:47.697 --> 00:25:49.408
to make yourself comfortable.

00:25:49.609 --> 00:25:52.550
Or sometimes it so happens that you quarrel with your wife,

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.941
quarrel with your husband, quarrel with your children,

00:25:55.142 --> 00:25:56.883
“Oh, we are getting late, we are getting late

00:25:57.084 --> 00:25:58.200
we have to be on the time.”

00:25:58.401 --> 00:26:00.268
All this madness comes to people

00:26:00.469 --> 00:26:02.870
because they have not got their Realization.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:05.790
Once you get Realization, you station down.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:08.830
You are very much at ease with yourself.

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:12.189
You don’t hurry others and you don’t trouble others.

00:26:12.430 --> 00:26:15.709
Like small, small things, how much we trouble by our worries.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:19.470
You see, human beings will go on saying, “I’m worried.”

00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:22.390
But what’s the use of worrying? Now if I tell you, “Don’t worry”

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:23.774
you cannot stop it.

00:26:23.976 --> 00:26:25.990
But once the hole is made here,

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.190
which we call the Brahmarandhra is opened,

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.750
then there’s a hole out of which the worry comes out,

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:32.990
and then you just cannot worry.

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.230
Even if you want to worry, you won’t worry;

00:26:35.469 --> 00:26:40.270
because somehow or other you go beyond that nonsense of worrying.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:44.910
In any way, mentally I cannot convince you that you don’t worry.

00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.390
But once you get Realization, you’ll be amazed,

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.590
you’ll be just enjoying yourself.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:52.310
Even if you are late, you are not going to bother about

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:54.510
or trouble others and you will find

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.670
that you’ll be are always in time for things,

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:58.630
because there is a force,

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:02.150
this All Pervading Power of God looks after you.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:04.750
You start believing in it, how it works out.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.590
You won’t believe how much it helps,

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:12.070
how much it works out, how it can operate

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:14.469
just beyond description.

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:17.116
I mean, I’ll tell you a story which you won’t believe.

00:27:17.324 --> 00:27:20.105
Did I tell them yesterday about the boy who fainted?

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.029
SY: I don't think so, Mother.
SM: No.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.269
SM: A story about Myself,

00:27:24.469 --> 00:27:27.269
and then a story about Warren I can tell you.

00:27:27.469 --> 00:27:30.190
It’s in the newspaper, so you can believe it.

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:32.670
I was giving a lecture in Bedford

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.950
and that was from seven to ten

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:38.710
and about eight o’clock a boy fell down somewhere,

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:42.269
about I don’t know ten-fifteen miles from a bridge.

00:27:42.469 --> 00:27:45.750
Very deep down he fell down from his motorbike.

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.120
And they sent for an ambulance.

00:27:48.321 --> 00:27:50.640
They got frightened; they thought this boy must be dead,

00:27:50.841 --> 00:27:52.869
to fall down to this extent.

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:56.270
So the ambulance came in and when the ambulance came in,

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.630
this boy just walked up, and he came up

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:00.390
and he sat in the ambulance.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.269
So they said, “How are you?”

00:28:02.469 --> 00:28:04.269
He said “I’m all right, nothing wrong with me.”

00:28:04.469 --> 00:28:06.071
So they said, “But nothing happened to you.”

00:28:06.272 --> 00:28:07.950
He said, “No, I broke lots of things

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.556
but a Lady came in a white clothes,

00:28:10.757 --> 00:28:13.122
in a white Mercedes (that’s My car),

00:28:13.323 --> 00:28:16.469
and She walked down up to me and She cured me.

00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:21.510
And only She left the lower portion of my bone,

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.950
and She said that, You come for this to Me,

00:28:24.151 --> 00:28:26.150
and the rest is I’m perfectly all right, see."

00:28:26.469 --> 00:28:28.190
They couldn’t believe it, you see.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.790
And the police was there, and everybody was there.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:34.917
And the next day he saw My photograph in the newspaper,

00:28:35.118 --> 00:28:36.990
and he informed them, he informed the police,

00:28:37.191 --> 00:28:38.914
“This is the Lady Who came and cured me.”

00:28:39.115 --> 00:28:40.990
So they telephoned our people, and ask them,

00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:42.310
“Did She pass this way that day?”

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:44.710
They said, “That time She was just giving lecture

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:47.109
before six hundred people. She was not there.”

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.269
So they were quite amazed, how it has happened. But it can happen.

00:28:50.469 --> 00:28:52.710
It’s nothing new. I mean it has happened many a times.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:55.670
But one of these that has appeared in the newspaper is like that.

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:57.469
Now, how does this happen?

00:28:57.670 --> 00:29:01.110
God has got wonderful television also, perfect,

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.550
it’s so systematic, it’s so scientific.

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:08.389
How it works, that for that you have to just see and wonder.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:12.189
He has got telecommunication, He has got computers,

00:29:12.469 --> 00:29:14.590
He has got everything that you have created,

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:18.463
but extremely efficient and methodical.

00:29:18.664 --> 00:29:21.349
You don’t have to worry, it just works out.

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.909
There are so many things that have happened,

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:27.190
like you have heard that Christ gave bread,

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:30.269
five bread and fish to so many people.

00:29:30.469 --> 00:29:32.710
It’s nothing new to now Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:34.469
They have seen this many a times happening,

00:29:34.670 --> 00:29:36.310
in our groups and in our camps.

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:39.349
But another thing which is not believable

00:29:39.550 --> 00:29:41.590
but it has happened to one Mr. Warren,

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.468
Dr. Warren, who is here from Australia.

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:47.269
When he came to India and he got his Realization,

00:29:47.469 --> 00:29:48.736
and when he went back he said,

00:29:48.895 --> 00:29:51.845
“I must now start talking about Sahaja Yoga

00:29:52.046 --> 00:29:53.630
and giving Realization to people.”

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:58.830
And when he went back to Australia there was a petrol crisis.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.909
And there was no petrol in his car, about to finish,

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:03.803
so they thought, “Now, what to do?

00:30:04.004 --> 00:30:06.550
We’ll not have any petrol. How to do Mother’s work?”

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.119
So they said, “Lets try.

00:30:08.321 --> 00:30:11.990
We’ll just go wherever we want, we’ll not look at the petrol.”

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:15.950
And they did this for twenty-one days, continuously,

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:19.092
and when they went to the petrol pump after twenty-one days,

00:30:19.293 --> 00:30:22.109
because the petrol pumps had opened out,

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:24.349
the petrol pump fellow said that,

00:30:24.551 --> 00:30:29.269
“There is hardly one liter space there. What am I to fill in?”

00:30:29.469 --> 00:30:32.750
And they were amazed, they did it twenty-one days. It can happen.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:36.268
You do not know when you say God is Almighty,

00:30:36.469 --> 00:30:39.270
when we say that He can do whatever He wants to do.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.630
He does everything.

00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:44.350
When we say that we are not aware that what He can do.

00:30:44.622 --> 00:30:48.548
We just think that at the most He can make flowers into fruits,

00:30:48.749 --> 00:30:51.269
at the most He can make our heart beat,

00:30:51.508 --> 00:30:55.349
at the most He can make us from amoeba to human being.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.269
But just think of it,

00:30:57.469 --> 00:30:59.789
how far He can go,

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:02.030
and how capable He is

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:07.779
and how full of compassion He is for His own creation.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:10.870
Now you have to enter into that area.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.230
First of all, unless and until you are there,

00:31:13.469 --> 00:31:15.150
you are really blessed by God,

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:18.539
you cannot believe it how it helps.

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:24.469
Thirdly, the third center, is the center of your seeking,

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:28.030
as he has told you, is the center of your seeking.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:31.150
Now the seeking gets satisfied

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:36.550
in the sense that you feel you are no more to seek,

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:38.470
now you have to give.

00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.070
You are asking for the light,

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:44.269
you have got the light, and you have to give the light.

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:47.762
But you do not develop the fanatic attitude

00:31:47.963 --> 00:31:51.504
that, “I am the right person, and you are the wrong person”

00:31:51.706 --> 00:31:54.492
and that kind of a violent nature,

00:31:54.693 --> 00:31:58.230
but you develop a very gentle and a kindly

00:31:58.469 --> 00:32:00.670
and affectionate nature towards that person.

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:03.510
Because you have gone through that kind of an experience,

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:06.030
so you know that this person is ignorant.

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:09.070
Gradually when he will see the light, he will understand.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:12.150
So you don’t force your way onto him, at all.

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:16.347
On the contrary you allow that person to slowly

00:32:16.548 --> 00:32:21.109
take to it, and awaken his Kundalini and see for himself

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:23.150
so that he should certify himself.

00:32:23.390 --> 00:32:25.510
You don’t force him to say things,

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:27.346
you do not organize him,

00:32:27.547 --> 00:32:30.957
you do not make him a member,

00:32:31.158 --> 00:32:33.268
you do not take money from him, nothing.

00:32:33.469 --> 00:32:36.510
You leave him alone. If he wants to come, he can come.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.393
If he does not want to come, he need not come.

00:32:39.594 --> 00:32:42.590
In Sahaja Yoga, we have made it compulsory

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:44.429
that all the centers we are running,

00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:47.790
no young boys should come who are below age

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:49.550
without the permission of their parents,

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:51.950
even to visit, leave alone living there.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:56.510
So that, that’s how we allow only those people

00:32:56.750 --> 00:33:01.069
who are grown up, adults, to come with their own wishes.

00:33:01.270 --> 00:33:02.602
They are not to be forced.

00:33:02.803 --> 00:33:06.273
If they want to go today, we’ll say, “All right, go just now.”

00:33:07.171 --> 00:33:10.110
There is no compulsion on anyone,

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:13.350
because one thing you must know, that you cannot compel

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:16.269
as far as your Self Realization is concerned.

00:33:16.469 --> 00:33:18.350
Because it is of no use.

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:21.310
It has to come through your freedom,

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:24.629
through your asking, otherwise we cannot work it out.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:28.590
Unless and until you ask for it, we cannot do it,

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.070
it is an impossibility.

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:32.436
So you must understand that

00:33:32.627 --> 00:33:35.462
I cannot force you to get Realization.

00:33:35.663 --> 00:33:36.950
It has to work out.

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:41.004
If it works out, you are a lucky person. I cannot guarantee it.

00:33:41.205 --> 00:33:44.149
If it works out that means it is your own,

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:47.750
and if it has not worked out and if you want to work Me out

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.390
or anybody to work it out, they’ll work it out.

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:54.269
But it cannot be guaranteed, it cannot be promised.

00:33:54.469 --> 00:33:57.670
So your seeking stops and what happens

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:01.339
that you start looking at yourself

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.993
and seeing your own glory,

00:34:04.184 --> 00:34:07.189
and understanding your own powers,

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.430
get yourself cleaned out,

00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:14.483
and you want to give others that solace that you have got,

00:34:14.684 --> 00:34:17.030
that Realization that you have got.

00:34:17.390 --> 00:34:20.590
So, I always say that I’m the greatest capitalist,

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:24.165
because if I have all the powers I’m the greatest capitalist,

00:34:24.366 --> 00:34:26.269
and I’m the greatest communist

00:34:26.468 --> 00:34:29.070
because I cannot live without distributing you.

00:34:29.649 --> 00:34:32.190
I must distribute. When we talk of capitalism,

00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:34.468
what do you have? These stones? What do you have?

00:34:34.709 --> 00:34:36.349
What do you distribute? The stones?

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.310
And what are you a communist? What are you distributing?

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:39.709
Only stones.

00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:43.468
So there is nothing to be proud of these worldly possessions.

00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:45.349
What you are to be proud of,

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.629
or to be conscious of, is your Spirit.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:52.790
Spirit is the only thing that can kindle another Spirit.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:57.269
I have not seen any matter can kindle that joy in anyone.

00:34:57.469 --> 00:35:00.757
At the most if you give some matter to somebody, at the most,

00:35:00.958 --> 00:35:04.284
that is the only advantage of having some material thing is

00:35:04.485 --> 00:35:06.028
that you can give away,

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.550
that you can express your love through some material things.

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:12.790
But otherwise the matter has no value of any kind.

00:35:13.469 --> 00:35:15.670
But Spirit has absolute value,

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:18.910
because it can kindle light into another’s life,

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:22.430
and there cannot be anything better than to be given to anyone else.

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:26.670
No amount of money, no amount of empires,

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:29.550
nothing can give that which is the Spirit,

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:31.830
because the Spirit is the ultimate.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.477
After that you don’t seek anything.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:38.190
That’s what is the Kundalini, is the true desire

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:41.270
which wants to become the reality,

00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:44.269
which wants to become the divinity.

00:35:44.469 --> 00:35:47.630
To get divinity within you is the highest thing,

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:49.630
and that’s what once you get,

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:52.230
you don’t want anything else.

00:35:52.469 --> 00:35:55.110
So the seeking starts improving.

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:58.149
Around the seeking are the Ten Commandments, you can say,

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.652
or the ten primordial masters.

00:36:00.853 --> 00:36:04.070
There are many others, but the primordial masters, the ten,

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:06.269
who came on this earth, one after another,

00:36:06.469 --> 00:36:08.454
to teach us how to balance ourselves.

00:36:08.655 --> 00:36:11.749
After Realization I’ve seen people automatically balance.

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:14.510
I don’t tell them anything about Ten Commandments.

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:16.870
I don’t say “Don’t”, I never say.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:18.856
I said, “You get your Realization.”

00:36:19.058 --> 00:36:22.268
Once they get Realization they just start

00:36:22.469 --> 00:36:26.269
behaving in such a manner that is extremely righteous,

00:36:26.469 --> 00:36:30.229
extremely balanced, extremely holy.

00:36:30.469 --> 00:36:32.869
Such a person becomes immediately

00:36:33.110 --> 00:36:37.630
rid of all the horrible habits they have,

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:43.057
all the enslavement of passion, and lust and greed.

00:36:43.258 --> 00:36:44.989
Everything drops out just like that,

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:50.601
and like a beautiful lotus they come out of that mire,

00:36:53.948 --> 00:36:56.269
that darkness, into light.

00:36:56.469 --> 00:37:00.508
And then in the light they see it so clearly,

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:03.829
that this is not the thing that I can have,

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:06.269
this is not the thing that I can wear,

00:37:06.469 --> 00:37:08.190
and immediately they give it up.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:11.030
That’s how you become a new personality.

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:13.296
This religion is born within you.

00:37:13.497 --> 00:37:16.840
Now we talk of religion, this religion that religion, that religion.

00:37:17.041 --> 00:37:18.789
Everybody is talking of different religions

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:20.390
and dogmas, and this and that,

00:37:20.591 --> 00:37:22.590
and only fighting everywhere you go.

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:25.190
They are fighting among each other, it’s still going on.

00:37:25.469 --> 00:37:28.909
It’s endless; they are all fighting morning till evening.

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:31.910
Then I have seen also some people who try to unite religions

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:35.389
and there also they have nothing but all the devils put together,

00:37:35.590 --> 00:37:37.269
all devils joined together to unite.

00:37:37.469 --> 00:37:39.710
There is nothing of reality in them.

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:43.469
So the people are puzzled, “What is happening to religion?”

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:46.990
These organized religions also can be very dangerous.

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:50.070
They can put you into such norms that you can really

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:52.990
get absolutely brain-washed,

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:55.790
and you start believing that what you are doing is correct,

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:58.590
without understanding why are you doing it.

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:02.030
Most of the things tell, “This is a mystery, that is a mystery.”

00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:03.830
Then why, what are you doing there?

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:05.867
If it is a mystery, it is better you give up.

00:38:06.068 --> 00:38:08.761
But they’ll just brand you that “This is mystery, that is mystery”.

00:38:08.962 --> 00:38:10.149
You have to accept.

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:12.390
But what is the advantage of that kind of a life,

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:13.789
nobody wants to see.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:17.229
As I told you, that Christ has asked for one thing,

00:38:17.469 --> 00:38:20.070
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”,

00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:25.199
and let us see which religious organization

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.990
has granted that to people.

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:30.445
It’s only your Spirit, when It is awakened and reborn,

00:38:30.646 --> 00:38:32.709
you can have that innocence within you.

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:36.110
As it is today, it’s getting late,

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:38.630
but I have to tell you that the chakras

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:42.190
as he explained, I am just giving you the powers of every chakra.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:49.216
And the power of the chakra of heart is tremendous.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:53.969
It gives you the fearlessness.

00:38:54.658 --> 00:38:57.310
When the child is about twelve years of age,

00:38:57.510 --> 00:39:02.268
in this sternum bone, the antibodies are created by this chakra.

00:39:02.469 --> 00:39:04.604
And they are sent all over the body

00:39:04.805 --> 00:39:09.268
to fight the disease or any kind of an attack on the personality.

00:39:09.538 --> 00:39:14.350
Now, these are actually looked after by the deity in that center,

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:19.110
and this deity, when gets the message,

00:39:19.469 --> 00:39:25.269
She informs all the antibodies that “You have to fight.”

00:39:25.469 --> 00:39:29.119
And all of them will go at that point, join together,

00:39:29.321 --> 00:39:33.469
to fight the enemy of life, enemy of God.

00:39:34.091 --> 00:39:37.909
Like now we are having, now I’m here,

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:41.469
and Americans are to be realized,

00:39:41.710 --> 00:39:44.229
and we have to do something about America.

00:39:44.469 --> 00:39:47.789
Then knowing that how America is important -

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:51.268
I’ll tell you where America is in this body -

00:39:51.469 --> 00:39:55.070
people from Australia, from India,

00:39:55.469 --> 00:39:58.829
from France, from all over,

00:39:59.469 --> 00:40:01.469
have come down here.

00:40:02.289 --> 00:40:04.470
All the way they have come,

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:07.509
just to give Realization to Americans.

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:11.389
All of them. I never forced anybody, I never asked anybody,

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:14.350
they just came forward, “Mother, we are going to go with You,

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:18.224
and we are going to do this great work of Realization

00:40:18.425 --> 00:40:21.829
to people of America who are seekers.”

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:25.310
They all have come on their own, spending their own money,

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:27.575
and they are doing this work with Me.

00:40:27.776 --> 00:40:34.274
So you can image what a great attraction it must be,

00:40:34.475 --> 00:40:38.670
what a great attachment it must be, for the seekers of America,

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:42.230
that they have come all the way. They are all people on big jobs

00:40:42.431 --> 00:40:45.398
one is a doctor, another is an architect, another is this,

00:40:45.599 --> 00:40:49.269
all of them sacrificing their money, everything, time

00:40:49.469 --> 00:40:53.188
have come down here to be with Me for these two months

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.600
to work for America, from all over.

00:40:55.801 --> 00:40:58.317
We have some people who are actresses

00:40:58.518 --> 00:41:04.599
in the English drama

00:41:04.801 --> 00:41:07.830
or some are directors and things like that.

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:09.550
They all have come here.

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:11.430
In your Boston we have at least,

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:14.269
I think, ten people from ten countries.

00:41:14.469 --> 00:41:20.258
So you can imagine how is the whole attention, the priority.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:23.630
This is the important thing. They must get Realization.

00:41:23.921 --> 00:41:25.990
They do not get any money out of it;

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:28.269
they do not get any reward out of it,

00:41:28.469 --> 00:41:32.389
only the satisfaction that so many have got Realization.

00:41:32.704 --> 00:41:35.830
The more, the merrier. When they see more people coming

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:39.268
getting Realization, you must see their faces, they lit up.

00:41:39.469 --> 00:41:42.710
This kind of a personality people have not seen.

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:44.869
I had one bishop

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:48.028
who came to stay with Me in My house in London,

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.430
and when he saw Sahaja Yogis, he said,

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.469
“This is a rare caste and community. I have never seen such a...

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:56.710
So I’ve been telling people to do little things

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:59.350
in life, they cannot do it and look at these people,

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:03.630
how beautiful they are. I can’t believe how can they be so nice.”

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:06.030
Because your Spirit is beautiful,

00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:08.070
the Spirit is glorious,

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:10.110
and when you become that,

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:13.390
automatically it starts manifesting its beauty.

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:16.469
You don’t have to tell yourself, you’ll be amazed at yourself

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:18.829
how you have become so beautiful,

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:21.390
and so good and so nice.

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:25.030
So this quality of fearlessness comes to you

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:27.269
because your antibodies

00:42:27.469 --> 00:42:31.829
are completely charged with the power of the Spirit.

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:35.550
And you start understanding what sort of a disease is coming,

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:38.030
what sort of an attack is coming,

00:42:38.262 --> 00:42:40.393
and your body knows how to fight it.

00:42:40.594 --> 00:42:43.710
You know how to fight it, and when you know that,

00:42:43.911 --> 00:42:46.101
you are not afraid of any disease whatsoever,

00:42:46.302 --> 00:42:47.749
even it is cancer, anything,

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:51.629
people know how to fight it themselves and for others.

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:55.909
Now the higher chakra is of Vishuddhi chakra

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:59.390
and this chakra is what America is.

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:02.829
In the Universe this is the chakra,

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:07.408
Vishuddhi chakra, is what America represents.

00:43:07.609 --> 00:43:09.990
Because America has a responsibility,

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:12.134
this center has the responsibility.

00:43:12.375 --> 00:43:14.777
When they raise the head,

00:43:16.647 --> 00:43:19.390
human beings, then this center developed

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:22.498
the responsibility to be human beings.

00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:26.269
And the responsibility of spirituality

00:43:26.469 --> 00:43:29.293
lies on the shoulders of Americans.

00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:34.440
You had great people like Abraham Lincoln,

00:43:34.641 --> 00:43:38.869
very great people here professing about

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:43.670
freedom of your country and big ideal things.

00:43:44.033 --> 00:43:47.710
But to My dismay I find: where are those gone?

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:49.580
Where are those people

00:43:49.781 --> 00:43:52.510
who will take the responsibility of spirituality?

00:43:52.750 --> 00:43:56.790
They are lost with fake gurus, they are lost with cults,

00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:01.149
they are lost with all kinds of things and where are they?

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:04.469
It’s such a sad thing that the responsibility

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:06.749
which was on the shoulders of Americans

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:09.950
has been not properly tackled, at all.

00:44:10.151 --> 00:44:13.390
But now the time is – though we start slowly,

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:16.710
let us take up the responsibility and see for ourselves,

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:20.269
what we can do for our countrymen, for our people,

00:44:20.469 --> 00:44:22.869
and on the hole for the whole world.

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:26.309
You can do a lot, because that is your specialty

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:29.702
that is your job, which has to be done.

00:44:30.469 --> 00:44:34.510
Now this chakra gives you the power to be the witness.

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:37.550
First power you get that you become the witness

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:40.950
– witness of everything. The whole thing becomes like a drama,

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:44.789
like you are in the water, and then you suddenly come in a boat

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:48.870
and you start seeing the play of all these waves.

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:51.856
You are no more afraid, you just start seeing it as a drama;

00:44:52.058 --> 00:44:53.443
you become a witness.

00:44:53.644 --> 00:44:55.918
The second thing that happens to you with this,

00:44:56.119 --> 00:44:58.430
that you become collectively conscious.

00:44:58.630 --> 00:45:02.829
Your hands, if this chakra is good, start feeling the cool breeze,

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:07.189
start feeling the chakras of yourself and chakras of other people.

00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:09.709
With your hands you can cure people,

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:12.030
with your hands you can raise the Kundalini,

00:45:12.231 --> 00:45:13.950
with your hands you can give Realization.

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:17.112
These hands become powerful things.

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:20.630
Even the movement of these hands has a meaning;

00:45:20.862 --> 00:45:22.637
everything has a meaning.

00:45:22.838 --> 00:45:26.469
Whatever it does, little fingers, they all have a meaning

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:28.789
and because they get enlightened.

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:31.150
Mohammed Sahib has said very clearly,

00:45:31.351 --> 00:45:34.758
“At the time of resurrection your hands will speak.”

00:45:35.766 --> 00:45:38.909
Now if you talk to any Muslims,

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:42.508
they will say, “We have never heard of Resurrection day.”

00:45:42.709 --> 00:45:44.695
Find in the Koran, if you see,

00:45:44.896 --> 00:45:47.398
most of it is dealt with the resurrection day,

00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:50.659
and the doomsday is very little.

00:45:51.283 --> 00:45:53.469
But people will talk about the doomsday

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:55.990
because they can frighten others with that

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:59.550
and have their own cults and own things.

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:03.150
But actually the resurrection day is the most important thing.

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:07.615
And for which Mohammed Sahib has clearly said the future.

00:46:07.816 --> 00:46:10.790
He didn’t say that, “I’m the last, now nothing is going to happen.”

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:15.430
He said, “At the time of resurrection, your hands will speak.”

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:17.430
And that’s exactly what happens,

00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:20.829
that you start feeling others on your fingertips.

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:22.874
You know through your fingertips

00:46:23.076 --> 00:46:26.790
what centers are catching in another person or in yourself also,

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:30.670
and immediately you start improving it, if you know how to do it.

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:33.950
And that’s what you have to learn: is the divine technique,

00:46:34.151 --> 00:46:39.746
the true knowledge, of how to handle this power of Divine Love,

00:46:39.947 --> 00:46:42.046
that is flowing through you.

00:46:42.537 --> 00:46:46.269
So this center is very important, I think, for Americans.

00:46:46.469 --> 00:46:50.309
It has one side by which people are aggressive.

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:55.524
When they talk they’re bumptious, they are ego oriented,

00:46:55.725 --> 00:46:58.070
they try to suppress others by their speeches

00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:00.789
and try to dominate others when they talk

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:02.723
– these are the right sided people.

00:47:02.924 --> 00:47:06.350
The other side are the left sided people when they feel guilty,

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:09.030
they think they have done this wrong, and that wrong,

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:10.790
they should not have done this wrong.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:12.830
Actually I’ve seen that in America

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:16.110
most of the people have problems here, most surprising,

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:19.061
They are all the time shaking their neck like this, all the time.

00:47:19.262 --> 00:47:22.430
In My program also I’ve seen, they have always a problem here.

00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:25.950
The thing is that they have a greater responsibility

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:27.853
to keep this center the best,

00:47:28.048 --> 00:47:30.818
by keeping the responsibility of spirituality

00:47:31.019 --> 00:47:34.269
quite the highest priority.

00:47:34.469 --> 00:47:36.670
They should have the highest priority.

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:39.275
But what you find that all the people are coming

00:47:39.476 --> 00:47:41.669
from all over the world to help the Americans.

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:45.235
A day should come when the Americans should go all over the world

00:47:45.436 --> 00:47:46.630
to give Realization.

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:49.015
And I’m sure that day will come one day

00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:51.854
when you will grow up to that sense of responsibility

00:47:52.055 --> 00:47:54.673
when this center will really stand up,

00:47:54.874 --> 00:47:57.272
as a spiritual personality.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:01.811
Now, the higher center is of Agnya chakra which

00:48:02.013 --> 00:48:06.571
he has told you about, is the center when you get Realization,

00:48:06.772 --> 00:48:08.909
and when the Kundalini rises above that,

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:11.967
you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:48:12.423 --> 00:48:17.349
Now at this time you get the power first of all of curing people.

00:48:17.622 --> 00:48:19.390
If you touch somebody, he’s cured.

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:21.390
If you say something, that happens.

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:24.789
If you go in the house, something good comes in that house.

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:27.227
Auspiciousness starts working through you,

00:48:27.347 --> 00:48:28.781
when this center is opened.

00:48:28.982 --> 00:48:30.750
But one should not leave at that center,

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:33.973
because if you start moving onto the left, or to the right,

00:48:34.174 --> 00:48:35.989
you'll get into problems.

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:38.990
If that center starts moving onto the right,

00:48:39.191 --> 00:48:42.230
then you start seeing visions, which is a very wrong thing.

00:48:42.469 --> 00:48:44.548
You go into the realm of supra-conscious

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:46.590
or into the collective supra-conscious,

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:49.230
by you can become a very ego oriented person.

00:48:49.469 --> 00:48:53.268
You can be a very violent, hot tempered, quarrelsome person.

00:48:53.469 --> 00:48:55.590
Actually, Hitler used this.

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:59.310
Hitler used this method from the lamas he learnt,

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:03.269
and he put people onto the right side of the supraconscious,

00:49:03.469 --> 00:49:07.148
into collective supraconscious and put the spirits, dead spirits,

00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:12.630
who were of the people who were extremely ambitious and cruel.

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:15.269
That’s how this cruelty came into the Germans

00:49:15.431 --> 00:49:17.354
and they forgot what they were.

00:49:17.556 --> 00:49:19.030
They forgot they were human beings,

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:21.269
the way they killed, the way they behaved,

00:49:21.469 --> 00:49:23.950
it’s impossible for any human being to do that.

00:49:24.151 --> 00:49:26.249
But he managed this, and is written down

00:49:26.450 --> 00:49:30.590
that he got all this from lamas from Tibet.

00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:33.269
From there he got the knowledge how to put people

00:49:33.469 --> 00:49:35.909
onto the collective supraconscious.

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:38.390
Now the people who can go to the left side,

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:41.910
also start curing people, they start...

00:49:43.246 --> 00:49:45.950
In such a company you might just get stunned.

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:48.630
If you face such a person you might just get stunned.

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:55.389
Or you might get a kind of a complete attraction for such a person

00:49:55.590 --> 00:49:58.749
You might get completely under the domination of such a person.

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:01.430
You might surrender completely to such a person,

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:03.344
and you will not know what you are doing,

00:50:03.545 --> 00:50:05.844
till that person has completely destroyed you.

00:50:06.045 --> 00:50:08.869
This type of people have these horrible powers

00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:11.510
because they enter into the collective subconscious.

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:14.052
And when they enter into the collective subconscious,

00:50:14.253 --> 00:50:18.390
they gather those spirits, which they use.

00:50:19.234 --> 00:50:23.269
But the people, who as it is, move to the left side,

00:50:23.469 --> 00:50:28.630
who cry, weep, emotional, feel guilty all the time

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:31.990
miserable people, they jump onto the left side.

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:35.082
Now all the diseases, practically most of them,

00:50:35.283 --> 00:50:39.037
like AIDS, like cancer, like myelitis.

00:50:39.238 --> 00:50:42.030
All these diseases come from the left sided entry

00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:44.310
and is accepted by the doctors;

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:47.150
because I’ve seen a very good film made by the doctors,

00:50:47.351 --> 00:50:48.869
who were researching on cancer,

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:51.950
that when the body is vulnerable to these diseases,

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:56.110
means when you are over-exerting yourself,

00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:59.710
when there is too much of sympathetic activity in a person,

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:03.190
and when a person is absolutely fagged out with it,

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:05.531
at that time, they say,

00:51:05.732 --> 00:51:08.084
that these diseases are triggered into you,

00:51:08.227 --> 00:51:09.749
that somebody triggers it.

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:14.560
And what is this they call, is the protein 52, and protein 58,

00:51:14.761 --> 00:51:17.012
and all these names they give because doctors don’t know

00:51:17.213 --> 00:51:18.481
that they are dead spirits.

00:51:18.683 --> 00:51:21.257
And these are the things when they enter into you

00:51:21.458 --> 00:51:22.606
then they trigger it.

00:51:22.808 --> 00:51:24.604
But they say something very right,

00:51:24.724 --> 00:51:26.768
and that is that these things come

00:51:26.969 --> 00:51:29.941
from the area built in you since your creation,

00:51:30.142 --> 00:51:32.761
means your collective subconscious.

00:51:33.144 --> 00:51:35.190
And that I have been saying for so many years.

00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:37.029
Now recently I saw this film.

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:41.030
So they are coming to the same point, but after such a long time,

00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:42.950
that it is triggered by them.

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:46.909
So those people who go too much to the left get this trouble.

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:52.829
Those who go too much to the right get heart trouble, heart attacks;

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:56.989
but not the slow attack, because heart has double type of attacks,

00:51:57.190 --> 00:52:00.429
it can a be slow heart or it can be a fast heart.

00:52:00.699 --> 00:52:03.430
The people who go on the right side have everything fast,

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:06.190
liver is moving fast, everything moving fast,

00:52:06.391 --> 00:52:09.438
it’s such a speedy temperament because they are so speedy.

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.242
In the morning they’ll get up, “Now I have to go to the office”

00:52:12.385 --> 00:52:14.701
and they’ll be taking the breakfast in one hand,

00:52:14.902 --> 00:52:17.320
putting one foot in the trousers,

00:52:17.522 --> 00:52:20.750
and another hand into the coat, running to the car,

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:23.670
and there's a big another jam coming up

00:52:23.950 --> 00:52:27.268
and then swearing at everything and it’s a mess throughout.

00:52:27.469 --> 00:52:29.150
And the whole body gets messed up.

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:31.783
And when the whole body gets messed up,

00:52:31.894 --> 00:52:34.244
then what happens, that your speedometer

00:52:34.445 --> 00:52:36.789
which is the spleen also goes out of order

00:52:36.990 --> 00:52:39.670
and you develop a funny type of temperament.

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:42.430
If you say them that, “We have to go now to the airport”

00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:44.990
you see them absolutely gone as they are wobbly.

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:48.269
The whole machine goes off, you don’t know why,

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:50.639
if you ask them, “What’s the …?” “Oh! I have to go to the airport.”

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.910
So what? Even the name of the airport can put people like that.

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:57.590
So they become absolutely uneasy people,

00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:02.030
and this kind of thing when happens, you see, you are in for trouble

00:53:02.231 --> 00:53:04.026
you are very much in for trouble.

00:53:04.233 --> 00:53:06.651
And this is to be balanced and put right

00:53:06.852 --> 00:53:09.413
through your Kundalini awakening.

00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:12.749
Now this center as you know, is the most important center

00:53:12.951 --> 00:53:16.469
because this is the gate to the Kingdom of God,

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:19.628
and is governed by our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:22.269
who is the embodiment of innocence.

00:53:22.469 --> 00:53:26.606
Here He does not incarnate, there He incarnates on this earth.

00:53:26.807 --> 00:53:31.338
Now, His crucifixion was fixed, and He was to be crucified

00:53:31.539 --> 00:53:36.323
to show that He is eternal life, which does not die.

00:53:36.524 --> 00:53:39.749
He is Chaitanya; He is made of all these vibrations.

00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:42.150
So He could walk on the water also,

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:47.191
and He could pass through that tight closeness

00:53:47.405 --> 00:53:52.669
of these two balloon-like structures, ego and superego,

00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:56.630
and could settle there to establish that center for us,

00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:58.870
which is called as the Agnya chakra,

00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:01.789
which controls your ego and superego, both.

00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:06.710
But most surprising, the people who are, say, Catholics

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:10.150
are the people who use their superego.

00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:13.510
They get conditioned very much, this should not be done,

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:18.230
confessions, weeping, crying, unhappy...

00:54:18.469 --> 00:54:19.949
"We have to be miserable"… Why?

00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:23.909
Christ has been crucified for you. He has suffered for you.

00:54:24.110 --> 00:54:26.950
Why? If you have accepted Christ, you should be joyous.

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:28.661
Only to be awakened Christ,

00:54:28.844 --> 00:54:32.242
so that you get your Realization, that’s all. What is there to cry?

00:54:32.443 --> 00:54:35.269
If they are, say Protestants and all that...

00:54:35.469 --> 00:54:37.349
I took My birth in Protestant religion,

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:39.310
and many Hindus and Muslims ask Me,

00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:42.269
“Mother, why did You take Your birth in Protestant religion?”

00:54:42.469 --> 00:54:45.269
So I said, “They are very sophisticated fanatics,

00:54:45.469 --> 00:54:47.269
because they rationalize everything.

00:54:47.469 --> 00:54:50.269
They rationalize God, they rationalize every dogma, everything

00:54:50.469 --> 00:54:52.269
it’s such a thinking going on there,

00:54:52.469 --> 00:54:54.749
So it is very difficult to push them back,

00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:58.149
that God is not thinking, God is beyond thought,

00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:00.830
God is beyond your mind. Mind is limited.

00:55:01.070 --> 00:55:02.474
You have to go beyond that,

00:55:02.675 --> 00:55:05.789
and that’s why Christ crossed that limit by His resurrection.

00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:08.461
So His message is His resurrection

00:55:08.635 --> 00:55:12.890
and His resurrection has given us a special quality,

00:55:13.091 --> 00:55:14.887
that once He is awakened within us,

00:55:15.088 --> 00:55:18.150
the both these ego and superego are sucked in by Him.

00:55:18.390 --> 00:55:20.310
That means He died for our sins,

00:55:20.510 --> 00:55:22.950
so that He sucked our sins, our karmas,

00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:25.365
everything sucked in and this opens out.

00:55:25.566 --> 00:55:28.510
Once this opens out, the Kundalini comes out.

00:55:28.711 --> 00:55:31.269
And this is what He has done such a great work

00:55:31.469 --> 00:55:33.030
that He has died for our sins

00:55:33.217 --> 00:55:35.720
and when He is awakened,

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:39.404
both these institutions are sucked in,

00:55:39.605 --> 00:55:41.470
and you become

00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:45.430
egoless, superegoless,

00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:48.269
you become de-conditioned automatically.

00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:52.469
Now this great incarnation was called as Mahavishnu

00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:55.269
and is described in the ancient books

00:55:55.469 --> 00:55:58.708
about fourteen thousand years back, by Markandeya.

00:55:58.910 --> 00:56:01.269
But people could not relate it to that,

00:56:01.469 --> 00:56:03.269
because when Christians went from here,

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:05.973
they went in a different mode, it was a political stunt.

00:56:06.174 --> 00:56:09.268
You see, they carried a gun in one hand and a Bible in another hand.

00:56:09.469 --> 00:56:12.383
Such people could not communicate with other people,

00:56:12.585 --> 00:56:14.226
who had everything with them,

00:56:14.427 --> 00:56:17.630
and they never read those books to them, it was all prohibited.

00:56:17.870 --> 00:56:22.030
Bible is too small a book to contain a character like Christ.

00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:24.006
He was too great a man,

00:56:24.207 --> 00:56:26.268
and we should have gone all out to see

00:56:26.469 --> 00:56:28.510
what He’s described in other scriptures,

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:30.630
how He’s talked about, let us find out.

00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:32.630
We should have been open minded about it.

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:35.270
Instead of that people just laughed

00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:38.835
and mocked at all these old books, the Scriptures,

00:56:39.036 --> 00:56:40.557
and they thought they are the wisest.

00:56:40.759 --> 00:56:44.190
This is the worst part is that the ego thinks they are the highest,

00:56:44.430 --> 00:56:46.390
they are the best, they can do what they like

00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:48.030
and that is how they lived.

00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:51.230
But thank God, now, people are realizing

00:56:51.469 --> 00:56:54.789
that we have missed the point, we have definitely missed the point.

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:57.263
So we have to see what He was

00:56:57.464 --> 00:57:00.430
before He came on this earth,

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:05.269
in the Heaven, how He was created, how He was Alpha and Omega,

00:57:05.469 --> 00:57:08.869
what was His own nature, for what purpose He came,

00:57:09.110 --> 00:57:12.030
and why He died, why He was resurrected,

00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:14.509
why this drama was to be carried out?

00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:18.710
For this, only three and a half years of Christ cannot explain,

00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:22.390
and people cannot tell us why all these things happened.

00:57:22.590 --> 00:57:25.269
We have to keep a very open mind about Christ,

00:57:25.469 --> 00:57:28.829
and we have to see with our own eyes how it works out.

00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:31.269
In Kundalini awakening you’ll be surprised,

00:57:31.469 --> 00:57:33.269
when the Kundalini stops here,

00:57:33.469 --> 00:57:35.336
and this chakra is closed,

00:57:35.537 --> 00:57:39.469
then you have to say the Lord’s prayer, everywhere,

00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:41.830
whether you are a Jew, you are a Muslim,

00:57:42.070 --> 00:57:44.190
you are a Hindu or a Christian.

00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:47.269
From whatever community you become a yogi,

00:57:47.469 --> 00:57:50.829
you become a realized soul, you have to say the Lord’s Prayer,

00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:52.581
because the Kundalini won’t rise,

00:57:52.782 --> 00:57:57.430
and that is the one of the greatest proof

00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:59.349
that Christ resides here.

00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:02.870
If you do not say the Lord’s Prayer, it doesn’t work out.

00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:05.309
So Lord’s Prayer is a mantra, is a chanting,

00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:07.786
but is to be said by a person who is a realized soul,

00:58:07.987 --> 00:58:09.349
who is authorized for you.

00:58:09.550 --> 00:58:11.550
Otherwise it is called as anadhikar cheshta,

00:58:11.790 --> 00:58:13.629
means the person who has no right,

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:16.390
is trying to do something, is doing a wrong thing.

00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:19.469
So those who are realized souls, when they say

00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:23.269
this mantra, then this center is opened up,

00:58:23.469 --> 00:58:25.869
Christ is awakened, and you are allowed

00:58:26.106 --> 00:58:29.051
to see, allow your Kundalini to pass through it

00:58:29.252 --> 00:58:33.269
and enter into the realm of this limbic area

00:58:33.469 --> 00:58:40.469
where is one thousand petaled Lotus remains.

00:58:40.964 --> 00:58:43.830
Now these petals then open up,

00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:47.269
because of the pressure being reduced

00:58:47.469 --> 00:58:49.139
of the ego and super ego,

00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:54.390
and they are in different beautiful colored flames.

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:58.350
The outside starts with a just like

00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:01.454
from vibgyor if you take it, from

00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:05.749
Vibgyor in the same way they start, but very slowly moving

00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:08.763
and the end ones are like crystal, crystal,

00:59:08.964 --> 00:59:10.910
absolutely like crystal, they’re shinning.

00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:13.229
And when the Kundalini comes out of it

00:59:13.469 --> 00:59:16.990
you see the whole thing opened out, the whole chakra opens out.

00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:21.550
This is a very important center which has to be opened out

00:59:21.790 --> 00:59:24.510
because here all the seven centers are there.

00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:27.339
For example, we have got here at the back,

00:59:27.540 --> 00:59:31.124
if you start here, from here if you start, is the Mooladhara,

00:59:31.325 --> 00:59:33.835
and then around it is the Swadisthana,

00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:37.235
and here is the Nabhi, and then it is the Heart.

00:59:37.436 --> 00:59:40.780
See now. This is the hole which has to open,

00:59:40.981 --> 00:59:42.326
and this is the Heart,

00:59:42.527 --> 00:59:46.269
means if there is a dirty heart,

00:59:46.469 --> 00:59:49.469
if there is a closed heart, if it is a tired heart,

00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:53.188
if there is a sick heart, then this doesn’t open.

00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:56.230
So in the heart resides the Spirit,

00:59:56.469 --> 00:59:58.789
and that’s why this is the seat of the Spirit,

00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:00.550
but it resides in the heart.

01:00:00.790 --> 01:00:03.910
So when this opens out,

01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:08.416
this flower-like lotus opens out,

01:00:08.639 --> 01:00:11.550
then the Kundalini rises in Her own glory,

01:00:11.751 --> 01:00:14.190
and you get your Realization, as you got it.

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:17.350
Now as I told you, it is the beginning.

01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:19.269
In the Bible it is said,

01:00:19.469 --> 01:00:22.269
“I will appear before you like tongues of flames,”

01:00:22.477 --> 01:00:24.972
and you can see it. I see it every day,

01:00:25.173 --> 01:00:27.030
the beautiful tongues of flames.

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:29.630
But you can’t see it because you are in it.

01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:33.549
Whatever you see, you are not, so you have to first become.

01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:36.350
Once you become and you grow into that,

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:39.950
then you can also start seeing, but just now you have to become.

01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:43.188
Supposing you see the light, means you are not the light.

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.350
If you see anything, you are not that.

01:00:45.550 --> 01:00:50.705
So the question is of becoming, of actualizing and growing into it

01:00:50.906 --> 01:00:53.510
and knowing about everything that you do,

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:56.590
Everything should be knowledgeable and should be understood,

01:00:56.830 --> 01:00:58.469
should be logical.

01:00:58.790 --> 01:01:02.350
I hope it works out in this place.
I have told you all about chakras.

01:01:02.550 --> 01:01:06.269
Tomorrow what to do after Self Realization I’ll tell you.

01:01:07.404 --> 01:01:09.560
And we'll have another session here in this hall,

01:01:09.761 --> 01:01:11.131
luckily we have got it,

01:01:11.332 --> 01:01:13.900
and we have decided to have one more program tomorrow.

01:01:14.101 --> 01:01:16.950
I hope it will be nice tomorrow and it won’t rain so much.

01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:19.749
So call all your friends. I will tell you what’s to be done

01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:22.546
after Realization, what is the situation.

01:01:22.747 --> 01:01:25.950
So, may God bless you. Thank you.

01:01:29.502 --> 01:01:31.110
SY: Friday night, Shri Mataji.

01:01:31.311 --> 01:01:33.262
SM: We have tomorrow.
SY: Friday, Friday.

01:01:33.413 --> 01:01:37.414
SM: I'm sorry. I don't know, whatever it is, you tell them.

01:04:21.043 --> 01:04:23.994
Like yesterday you have to do. We'll do it again today

01:04:24.234 --> 01:04:25.874
and it will work out I'm sure.

01:04:26.074 --> 01:04:31.313
Like yesterday we have to put our hands on our lap just like this,

01:04:31.514 --> 01:04:33.073
in a very comfortable way.

01:04:33.273 --> 01:04:35.233
First of all, we must sit comfortably.

01:04:35.434 --> 01:04:39.073
There should be no discomfort and that is distractive.

01:04:39.273 --> 01:04:41.073
So just seat very comfortable.

01:04:41.273 --> 01:04:45.233
And everyone should do it. There is nothing special or anything,

01:04:45.434 --> 01:04:47.798
but you must try to do it and achieve it

01:04:47.925 --> 01:04:50.073
because is not proper not to do it.

01:04:50.274 --> 01:04:51.965
When there is a chance you must do it,

01:04:52.166 --> 01:04:55.073
and it won't be good for others also if you don't want to do it.

01:04:55.273 --> 01:04:59.153
It's nothing, nothing too much for you to do it, it's very simple.

01:04:59.354 --> 01:05:01.593
So put your left hands towards Me like this

01:05:01.834 --> 01:05:04.113
and the right hand you have to use,

01:05:04.314 --> 01:05:06.866
because the left hand is the power of desire

01:05:07.046 --> 01:05:09.982
and the right hand is the power of action.

01:05:10.183 --> 01:05:12.272
And as I told you yesterday,

01:05:12.473 --> 01:05:16.114
that in a village of 6000 people I did not do anything like that.

01:05:16.314 --> 01:05:18.634
Just when I stand up they get Realization

01:05:18.874 --> 01:05:21.273
because they are very simple people in a village.

01:05:21.514 --> 01:05:24.305
But here people are quite complicated, they have problems:

01:05:24.506 --> 01:05:27.952
self-created, society-generated,

01:05:28.153 --> 01:05:30.832
the atmosphere generated, all sorts of things are there.

01:05:31.076 --> 01:05:33.664
Doesn’t matter. So we have to little bit nourish

01:05:33.865 --> 01:05:37.572
our different centers, which is a very easy thing to do,

01:05:37.772 --> 01:05:41.262
and I, as I told you, you try to follow it.

01:05:41.462 --> 01:05:44.138
Now, you have to close your eyes,

01:05:44.338 --> 01:05:47.439
and not to open your eyes because of the Agya Chakra.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:48.694
That’s very important.

01:05:48.894 --> 01:05:50.548
Because if your eyes are opened

01:05:50.748 --> 01:05:53.731
I find it difficult to raise your Kundalini.

01:05:53.931 --> 01:05:55.921
You have to keep your eyes completely closed,

01:05:56.121 --> 01:05:57.627
it will help your eyesight also.

01:05:57.827 --> 01:05:59.572
So keep your eyes completely closed.

01:05:59.772 --> 01:06:03.421
You don’t have to open till you are told to open your eyes.

01:06:03.621 --> 01:06:06.250
So you don’t have to worry at all.

01:06:06.454 --> 01:06:10.247
If there is anything tight in your body, somewhere,

01:06:10.447 --> 01:06:13.215
just loosen it a little bit, – will be a good idea,

01:06:13.415 --> 01:06:16.045
so that you don’t feel uncomfortable.

01:06:17.252 --> 01:06:20.101
There’s nothing dangerous happens, never has happened.

01:06:20.546 --> 01:06:23.330
At the most you may feel little hot in the hand,

01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:25.735
at the most, doesn’t matter.

01:06:26.257 --> 01:06:29.342
So now, please close your eyes. Just close your eyes.

01:06:29.542 --> 01:06:32.254
Put your both the hands on your lap towards Me.

01:06:32.454 --> 01:06:35.584
Strain your fingers, stretching towards Me.

01:06:35.785 --> 01:06:39.373
Just put your hands on your lap stretching.

01:06:39.574 --> 01:06:41.683
Now put the right hand...

01:06:41.883 --> 01:06:44.723
Left hand has to be fixed as it is, all the time.

01:06:44.923 --> 01:06:49.580
Now the left hand is to be stretched towards Me,

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:52.104
stretched towards Me, not towards your own hands,

01:06:52.306 --> 01:06:54.496
but towards Me, straight.

01:06:55.208 --> 01:07:00.979
Now, the right hand has to be lifted and put on your heart.

01:07:01.181 --> 01:07:04.728
Just put it on the left side, on your heart.

01:07:06.966 --> 01:07:10.113
At this point, with all sincerity,

01:07:10.716 --> 01:07:15.648
you have to say or ask a question three times:

01:07:15.849 --> 01:07:19.611
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" - with full confidence.

01:07:19.813 --> 01:07:22.356
First of all, you should not feel guilty at all.

01:07:22.557 --> 01:07:25.262
Forget the past. Forget the past!

01:07:25.462 --> 01:07:26.881
Please, forget the past.

01:07:27.081 --> 01:07:29.421
Just now we are talking about the present.

01:07:29.621 --> 01:07:35.300
So just say: "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:07:42.695 --> 01:07:45.218
Three times.

01:07:47.954 --> 01:07:51.271
With full confidence, ask the question.

01:08:01.667 --> 01:08:05.997
Now, put this right hand on your stomach,

01:08:06.198 --> 01:08:08.126
on the left-hand side,

01:08:08.327 --> 01:08:12.378
the center of Swadishtana on the left-hand side.

01:08:14.629 --> 01:08:18.944
Nabhi Chakra, on the Nabhi chakra on the left-hand side.

01:08:21.459 --> 01:08:24.966
This is the center of the primordial master within you.

01:08:25.166 --> 01:08:29.778
And as you are the Spirit, you have to say with full confidence:

01:08:30.066 --> 01:08:34.494
“Mother, I am my own master”.

01:08:34.716 --> 01:08:38.749
“I am my own guru” - you have to assert it.

01:08:39.958 --> 01:08:42.229
So that if you have been to wrong gurus,

01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:44.627
fake gurus, all kinds of cults,

01:08:44.827 --> 01:08:46.899
it will all disappear.

01:08:47.684 --> 01:08:49.388
Please, say ten times:

01:08:49.589 --> 01:08:54.230
"Mother, am I my own guide? Am I my own guru?"

01:08:54.431 --> 01:08:57.639
"Am I my own master?”

01:09:07.542 --> 01:09:10.056
Don’t feel guilty, please, don’t feel guilty.

01:09:10.256 --> 01:09:12.702
Don’t feel guilty.

01:09:15.304 --> 01:09:18.704
Still you are feeling guilty - it’s very wrong.

01:09:24.733 --> 01:09:26.765
Candles.

01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:33.477
Now, put this right hand down below on the stomach.

01:09:33.677 --> 01:09:38.220
Down below the stomach is the Swadishtana on the left-hand side.

01:09:40.061 --> 01:09:44.990
At this point you have to say:

01:09:45.471 --> 01:09:49.262
“Mother, make me the master of the Divine art

01:09:49.463 --> 01:09:51.499
or Divine technique”.

01:09:51.701 --> 01:09:55.267
“Mother, I want to be the master of Divine technique”.

01:09:55.468 --> 01:10:00.193
This is the center of the mastery of Divine technique.

01:10:04.890 --> 01:10:07.361
Better.

01:10:27.131 --> 01:10:30.024
Please, say this six times.

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:37.329
It's all right.

01:10:41.262 --> 01:10:46.273
Press this hand again onto the heart.

01:10:48.762 --> 01:10:50.586
Now assert here

01:10:50.788 --> 01:10:54.888
(unclear) you have to say it without feeling guilty.

01:10:55.288 --> 01:11:02.283
With full confidence you have to say: “Mother I am the Spirit”.

01:11:16.144 --> 01:11:18.846
SY: Vishuddhi.

01:11:55.685 --> 01:11:59.142
SM: Still, the Hamsa is.

01:12:07.283 --> 01:12:11.928
Now, please put this right hand on the neck.

01:12:12.128 --> 01:12:16.762
Please, put your neck straight, don’t push it back too much.

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:21.658
On the neck, on the left-hand side, near the shoulder,

01:12:21.859 --> 01:12:24.739
just put it there and..

01:12:26.112 --> 01:12:28.241
press it hard.

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:32.396
At this point

01:12:32.597 --> 01:12:36.142
you have to say: “Mother, I’m not guilty”.

01:12:37.407 --> 01:12:40.707
Please, say it: “Mother, I’m not guilty”.

01:12:40.907 --> 01:12:46.127
Sixteen times you have to say: “Mother, I’m not guilty”.

01:12:46.764 --> 01:12:49.516
Heart.

01:13:12.814 --> 01:13:15.643
It's better.

01:13:24.702 --> 01:13:27.500
SY: Yes, it's good.

01:13:39.672 --> 01:13:43.954
Now raise this hand higher onto your forehead across,

01:13:44.154 --> 01:13:45.866
on your forehead across.

01:13:46.066 --> 01:13:53.175
At this point you have to say: “Mother, I forgive everyone”.

01:13:55.035 --> 01:13:56.823
SM: Put the light there I think,

01:13:56.998 --> 01:14:00.811
because with this the right Vishuddhi is heated.

01:14:10.052 --> 01:14:12.381
Press it hard.

01:14:22.025 --> 01:14:23.598
Now without feeling guilty,

01:14:23.798 --> 01:14:26.542
put your right hand to the back of your head,

01:14:26.742 --> 01:14:27.928
back of your head,

01:14:28.128 --> 01:14:29.548
and try to press it hard,

01:14:29.748 --> 01:14:31.921
back of your head, just above, yes,

01:14:32.128 --> 01:14:34.932
back of your head. Now, try to pull it.

01:14:35.716 --> 01:14:37.861
Pull the head,

01:14:38.939 --> 01:14:42.787
and push the head backwards and pull with your hand.

01:14:42.988 --> 01:14:48.088
At this point you have to say without feeling guilty -

01:14:48.288 --> 01:14:51.040
hundred times I say: without feeling guilty -

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.763
you have to say:

01:14:54.788 --> 01:15:00.413
"Oh Lord, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong".

01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:04.845
Again you feel guilty. Don’t feel guilty.

01:15:04.997 --> 01:15:08.175
Please, don’t feel guilty.

01:15:09.182 --> 01:15:11.382
SM: Better.
SY: Yes, it's passed.

01:15:11.583 --> 01:15:13.894
SM: It's the (unclear). Still there.

01:15:24.891 --> 01:15:28.437
Now, raise your hand on top of your head.

01:15:28.638 --> 01:15:33.296
SM: Just do that slowly. No, with the candle, means.

01:15:35.139 --> 01:15:37.083
Now, press it hard,

01:15:37.298 --> 01:15:39.694
in the center of it with your palm.
