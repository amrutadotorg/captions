which uses the welcome all which will

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:26.360
rotate by which we realize that we are

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:29.360
inclined left or just other night this

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.360
twelve

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.700
we have to be aware of

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.700
because otherwise

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.599
[Music]

because if you Center it healthy and are

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.070
succeeding

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.990
completely so this to me is specific

between you understanding

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.530
I'm the understanding

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.810
waste it has to be helped

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.310
it

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.540
the newborn during his nine five

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.540
children

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.210
one has

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:56.930
it works Edom you are testing instrument

00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:00.370
so if you try to do something of your

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.370

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.259
[Music]

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:44.640
for example if Emily says that whatever

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.640
is there a ninja but not before

00:03:51.200 --> 00:04:11.139
[Music]

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:11.139
because our genes

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.950
in nature to see

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:43.830
wonderful what she doesn't she doesn't

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:43.830
she made itself up damages a lot to me

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:56.840
I got the wisdom it's the one

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:10.800
it is I carry the state of you in when

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:14.030

[Music]

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:26.559
outside the gyroscope

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:26.559
evidently

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:37.080
only the personality which is a phenom

00:05:38.029 --> 00:06:10.560

[Music]

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.530
extreme predictions

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.340
but in one spirit

00:06:49.240 --> 00:07:01.270
[Music]

00:06:51.600 --> 00:07:05.910
I think positions try to stabilize mr.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.910
logically what do we

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.850

except for you will you study

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:36.280
development university but example now

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:38.490
we are seeing it's not be not be near

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.490
life

00:07:42.210 --> 00:08:32.700
[Music]

00:07:47.910 --> 00:08:34.860
when you in this position so we see the

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.640
quality the best and that is whether

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:37.640
religion

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:45.610
so how wisdom is important that you even

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:51.040
become a star chief your wisdom you know

how it is only when you have done focal

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:55.530
points and just leave your Center

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:01.210
that's

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:17.170
when people tell me about someone as if

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:17.170
it was the another ball

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:27.160

if he leaves two pictures find the one

00:09:34.129 --> 00:09:37.089
is reflecting the other

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:47.130
there's no entry is determined for this

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.810
how do you end up

00:09:55.199 --> 00:10:06.579
you live by your wisdom by understanding

00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:10.060
itself in you may think is the mirror on

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:14.970
which is reflected it's just an illusion

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:18.309
