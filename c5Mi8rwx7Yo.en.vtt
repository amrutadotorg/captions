00:01:51.026 --> 00:01:54.489
When you are all meditating

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.675
and inside I also find it difficult to be outside.

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:08.300
So today you have arranged to have this puja here.

00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:14.410
Just before that you have to prepare yourself

00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:17.449
physically and mentally.

00:02:18.965 --> 00:02:23.677
Physically you must give yourself a bandhan

00:02:23.878 --> 00:02:26.582
and a bandhan is just nothing but

00:02:26.783 --> 00:02:30.925
that you give yourself a protection to your aura.

00:02:31.126 --> 00:02:35.230
And how you do it is very simple

00:02:35.574 --> 00:02:37.980
which I will tell you just now how to do it

00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:44.292
and then you sit down for your puja.

00:02:44.493 --> 00:02:47.982
Then mentally you have to put yourself right.

00:02:48.183 --> 00:02:52.472
First of all, you should not feel guilty at all.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.824
If you are guilty, you cannot do my puja.

00:02:57.087 --> 00:03:01.746
So, you should be absolutely above that.

00:03:02.011 --> 00:03:05.222
There should be no tension in your mind.

00:03:05.488 --> 00:03:08.746
You are not guilty, you are in the present.

00:03:08.972 --> 00:03:11.603
See like flowers you are looking.

00:03:11.804 --> 00:03:13.716
How can flowers be guilty?

00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:16.052
First get out of that guilt business.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.894
You should not feel guilty or tense.

00:03:19.113 --> 00:03:21.448
Everything that is done is the best.

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:23.334
You shouldn’t worry about it.

00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:27.012
It’s not your responsibility even to arrange it.

00:03:27.213 --> 00:03:30.496
Just think that everything is done sahaj.

00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:34.628
Gradually when you’ll move in Sahaja Yoga you’ll be surprised

00:03:34.878 --> 00:03:38.933
to see how things are arranged just beautifully.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.089
When these people just were finding out a place

00:03:43.371 --> 00:03:48.316
they had no place which was for less than 250$ each.

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.243
They said this is rather too much for everybody’s pocket.

00:03:51.444 --> 00:03:54.818
And then suddenly, spontaneously they found this place.

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.363
When they said 50$ nobody could believe.

00:03:57.564 --> 00:04:01.348
They thought that we’ll just get some porridge in the morning

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.792
and the rest of it will be fasting.

00:04:05.084 --> 00:04:06.943
So many were rather worried,

00:04:07.152 --> 00:04:10.340
some thought it was a scout camping ground or whatever it is

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:13.683
and quite worried when it starts raining.

00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:17.676
But, see, this is all God’s grace to get such a place,

00:04:17.877 --> 00:04:20.910
such a comfortable place for you to come here.

00:04:21.113 --> 00:04:24.035
Everything is arranged by God’s grace.

00:04:24.236 --> 00:04:25.793
So first we have to remember

00:04:25.994 --> 00:04:28.164
that it is all arrange through God's grace

00:04:28.365 --> 00:04:30.240
If something is not arranged just forget it,

00:04:30.441 --> 00:04:32.494
just leave it, just don’t worry.

00:04:32.695 --> 00:04:35.066
That’s the best way, you have to live.

00:04:35.313 --> 00:04:39.426
Then what happens is that you become one with the present

00:04:39.627 --> 00:04:44.002
and you can overcome all your problems of tension.

00:04:44.203 --> 00:04:46.701
Tension mounts up when we want to do

00:04:46.902 --> 00:04:48.802
which you are not supposed to do,

00:04:49.003 --> 00:04:51.437
which we are not successful.

00:04:51.638 --> 00:04:53.496
There is also a mental barrier

00:04:53.697 --> 00:04:55.768
between ourselves and our mind

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:58.796
that we want to do a particular thing in a particular way.

00:04:58.997 --> 00:05:02.044
If you can give up that, then you will be surprised

00:05:02.245 --> 00:05:07.810
that you become absolutely one with the Divine

00:05:08.011 --> 00:05:11.723
and you start working it out in a very beautiful manner.

00:05:11.924 --> 00:05:15.858
Now see the root of a little seed.

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:19.892
It just sprouts, it goes this way.

00:05:20.093 --> 00:05:22.598
If it finds there is an obstruction

00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:26.075
ot there is some sort of a stone or something, it goes around it.

00:05:26.302 --> 00:05:30.241
Then it finds something other obstruction, it goes away from it.

00:05:30.442 --> 00:05:32.021
It doesn’t fight that,

00:05:32.222 --> 00:05:34.476
just says, “All right, let me find my own way."

00:05:34.677 --> 00:05:39.653
And then he uses the same stone for holding the tree.

00:05:39.854 --> 00:05:43.849
So clever, he goes around the

00:05:45.294 --> 00:05:49.216
little stone and uses that for its own purpose.

00:05:49.442 --> 00:05:52.085
This is how a Sahaja Yogi should behave.

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:56.271
Not to take responsibility and put others into tension:

00:05:56.472 --> 00:05:58.285
“This must be done. This is not here."

00:05:58.486 --> 00:06:00.565
“That is not there." It’s not necessary.

00:06:00.766 --> 00:06:02.851
It’s your love that is important.

00:06:03.052 --> 00:06:07.702
For which you must have heard the story of an old woman

00:06:07.903 --> 00:06:10.341
who was living in a forest.

00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:12.560
Her name was Shavari

00:06:12.761 --> 00:06:16.520
and she heard that Shri Ram is going to come in the forest.

00:06:16.721 --> 00:06:20.981
And she was so much elated, so much happy.

00:06:21.223 --> 00:06:24.184
Such an innocent woman, she didn’t know what to do.

00:06:24.393 --> 00:06:27.770
So when Rama came she gave Him,

00:06:27.997 --> 00:06:31.661
we have some kind of berry, we called as ber,

00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:34.161
she gave them to Him to eat

00:06:34.362 --> 00:06:36.700
and she told in very great innocence

00:06:36.901 --> 00:06:41.442
that everyone of them I have tested to see that they are not sour.

00:06:41.677 --> 00:06:45.809
And she gave them to Him and he ate them so lovingly.

00:06:46.036 --> 00:06:49.399
So his brother was a hot-tempered fellow.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.864
He got very angry. He said, “What is this? This lady has no sense.

00:06:53.065 --> 00:06:58.265
She is giving all these things which are eaten by her, first of all."

00:06:58.466 --> 00:07:00.126
Which we call as uttishtha

00:07:00.327 --> 00:07:02.982
means somebody has eaten it, then you are not supposed to eat

00:07:03.183 --> 00:07:06.632
even your, say, your brother has eaten something,

00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:07.851
you cannot eat that.

00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:12.172
It’s regarded as something not good, not auspicious.

00:07:12.373 --> 00:07:15.599
"And this lady, an old lady with her few teeth that are left,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.330
she has just pierced every berry and has given to my brother."

00:07:19.531 --> 00:07:21.413
Very furious.

00:07:21.614 --> 00:07:26.083
So Rama’s wife, Sita, was just smiling at the whole situation

00:07:26.284 --> 00:07:28.669
and then Rama gave

00:07:29.552 --> 00:07:36.044
Rama gave that berry to his wife and she ate it.

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:40.708
She looked at her brother-in-law and She said: "See brother-in-law

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:43.372
“These are the best berrys I've ever eaten.

00:07:43.573 --> 00:07:45.507
I’ve never had such a taste before."

00:07:45.708 --> 00:07:47.294
But I’m not going to give you anything."

00:07:47.495 --> 00:07:49.677
See, the best way to challenge the ego

00:07:49.878 --> 00:07:52.521
is not to say that you are not going to have it.

00:07:52.697 --> 00:07:54.763
He said, “Why?” “No, I won’t give you.

00:07:54.964 --> 00:07:57.669
You won’t have them, I will not. I will eat all of them."

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.235
Then He said, “No, how can you eat all of that?”

00:08:00.436 --> 00:08:03.427
He snatched some of them and he ate and also felt the same thing.

00:08:03.638 --> 00:08:06.482
Because they are given out of love.

00:08:06.683 --> 00:08:08.724
Whatever is done out of love

00:08:08.925 --> 00:08:11.419
is a thousand-fold better

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.143
than that is done out of tension and problem.

00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:19.233
I should never like to cause any tension in your mind of any kind.

00:08:19.434 --> 00:08:21.702
So for small, small things you should not worry.

00:08:21.903 --> 00:08:24.560
You must give up your tensions absolutely

00:08:24.761 --> 00:08:28.997
and understand that you are the children of God.

00:08:29.211 --> 00:08:30.520
You are to be looked after.

00:08:30.721 --> 00:08:34.218
You are to given everything that is available in His realm.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.309
You should not get into tension at all.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:38.591
Firstly, not to feel guilty,

00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:41.552
thirdly to feel that we had to go to this guru, that guru.

00:08:41.753 --> 00:08:43.114
All right, forget it.

00:08:43.315 --> 00:08:46.348
Forget it. Whatever has happened has happened. Forget it!

00:08:46.549 --> 00:08:48.106
Don’t worry on that point also

00:08:48.307 --> 00:08:50.317
because that will tie you down all the time saying,

00:08:50.518 --> 00:08:52.059
“Why did you go to that guru?

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:54.638
Why did you pay money to this fellow?”

00:08:54.839 --> 00:08:55.994
Why did you do this?

00:08:56.195 --> 00:08:59.473
Just tell your mind, “I am not bothered.

00:08:59.674 --> 00:09:01.233
I am not bothered."

00:09:01.434 --> 00:09:03.824
Whatever has happened, has happened that person is finished.

00:09:04.025 --> 00:09:05.991
Now whatever my egg has done, now I am a bird.

00:09:06.192 --> 00:09:07.078
I have nothing to do."

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:09.290
So be in the present, that is very important.

00:09:09.491 --> 00:09:12.591
Be in the present, have no guilt,

00:09:12.833 --> 00:09:14.552
have no worries of the past

00:09:14.753 --> 00:09:18.882
because if you worry of the past you can never enjoy the present.

00:09:19.169 --> 00:09:22.042
And you are here to enjoy and not to worry about the past.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.254
What ever has happend, has happend, just forget it.

00:09:25.575 --> 00:09:27.747
I hope you understand this very well

00:09:27.948 --> 00:09:31.144
and to forget whatever has happened and forgive.

00:09:31.345 --> 00:09:33.509
There are Sahaja Yogis with you. Enjoy life.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.107
Always try to see the good points of other Sahaja Yogis

00:09:36.308 --> 00:09:37.850
and not the bad points.

00:09:38.051 --> 00:09:41.138
Normally we try to find out what’s wrong with another person,

00:09:41.339 --> 00:09:43.890
especially when we know about chakras.

00:09:44.091 --> 00:09:47.694
We just understand that this person has got these very bad chakras.

00:09:47.895 --> 00:09:50.348
Then the only thing what to do is to give yourself a bandhan,

00:09:50.549 --> 00:09:52.681
which I will tell you, and deal with the person.

00:09:52.882 --> 00:09:55.122
But when you know that person has this sickness

00:09:55.323 --> 00:09:56.722
or this kind of a chakra caught up,

00:09:56.923 --> 00:09:59.351
no use arguing, no use telling them.

00:09:59.552 --> 00:10:01.515
Let them come up, they’ll come right.

00:10:01.716 --> 00:10:03.202
Tell them that this is what it is.

00:10:03.403 --> 00:10:07.612
At the most you can tell your children, you can tell your wife.

00:10:07.813 --> 00:10:11.568
Someone, but somebody who is not that closely connected,

00:10:11.769 --> 00:10:14.371
you cannot put Sahaja Yoga into their heads.

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:16.645
You cannot force Sahaja Yoga in to them.

00:10:16.846 --> 00:10:20.608
Sahaja Yoga cannot be forced into anyone whatsoever.

00:10:20.809 --> 00:10:23.188
It has to be accepted, ask for it.

00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:24.794
It has its own protocol.

00:10:24.997 --> 00:10:29.052
It cannot be just poured into your mouth,

00:10:29.253 --> 00:10:31.569
that you’d better have it, is a wrong thing.

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:34.794
There are some people who still have lots of doubts,

00:10:34.995 --> 00:10:37.898
I know that, who are sitting here who have doubts.

00:10:38.099 --> 00:10:39.365
These should go away.

00:10:39.566 --> 00:10:41.960
Then because then they feel guilty, “I have doubts."

00:10:42.161 --> 00:10:45.187
Please get rid of those doubts if possible

00:10:45.388 --> 00:10:47.927
because I do not want that you should feel later on that,

00:10:48.128 --> 00:10:49.520
“Oh, Mother, we doubted you."

00:10:49.721 --> 00:10:52.569
Just now better get rid of the doubts.

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.271
One thing that one should understand

00:10:54.472 --> 00:10:56.122
that Mataji has nothing to gain for us.

00:10:56.323 --> 00:10:58.193
We cannot give her anything.

00:10:58.394 --> 00:10:59.890
We cannot give her anything.

00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:01.989
Only we have to take from Her.

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.607
If you understand that then you’ll have no doubts

00:11:04.808 --> 00:11:06.562
because that is one of the fears people have.

00:11:06.763 --> 00:11:09.593
That I’m going to start having something from you.

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:12.731
So once you understand that She has nothing to take away from us,

00:11:12.932 --> 00:11:15.085
She has to give us something.

00:11:15.286 --> 00:11:18.645
Supposing I say there is a diamond available here free for you,

00:11:18.856 --> 00:11:20.187
will you doubt me?

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:23.942
You’ll say, “All right, let’s see if it’s a diamond or a fake, clutch it.

00:11:24.192 --> 00:11:26.273
That’s how your attitude should be.

00:11:26.489 --> 00:11:29.435
So those who have doubts should know that with the doubts

00:11:29.636 --> 00:11:33.536
they will go very slow and they may be thrown out.

00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:35.874
So please don’t have any doubts.

00:11:36.075 --> 00:11:39.077
A doubting mind is the most troublesome thing.

00:11:39.278 --> 00:11:43.083
It will never allow you to enjoy your spirit.

00:11:43.341 --> 00:11:45.476
There is no need to doubt about it.

00:11:45.677 --> 00:11:49.122
This is opened everything is so open,

00:11:49.323 --> 00:11:51.786
there is no secret about it.

00:11:51.997 --> 00:11:55.786
You understand that and try to imbibe

00:11:56.138 --> 00:11:58.505
the quality of a good Sahaja Yogi,

00:11:58.706 --> 00:12:01.660
of a Sahaja Yogi who is steady.

00:12:01.861 --> 00:12:04.841
By doubting, the steadiness will go away

00:12:05.042 --> 00:12:09.283
and if a tree is not steady how will it imbed itself?

00:12:09.484 --> 00:12:12.452
It’s important that you should give up all doubts.

00:12:12.653 --> 00:12:15.366
You are so quickly into it.

00:12:15.567 --> 00:12:18.247
Seldom we do such a thing, too much of a thing,

00:12:18.448 --> 00:12:21.513
I mean never done like that before. It’s an experiment.

00:12:21.739 --> 00:12:23.726
We want to see now how it works out.

00:12:23.927 --> 00:12:24.811
It’s really an experiment.

00:12:25.012 --> 00:12:26.176
We have never done like this before.

00:12:26.377 --> 00:12:28.081
It’s a very dangerous thing.

00:12:28.282 --> 00:12:31.333
I’ve seen it that people who get into puja

00:12:31.534 --> 00:12:34.358
then they might get little stomach pain or something,

00:12:34.559 --> 00:12:37.357
or something will happen to you by which you will be cleared out,

00:12:37.558 --> 00:12:38.624
little bit.

00:12:38.825 --> 00:12:41.715
Not much but then you’ll feel much better out of that.

00:12:41.916 --> 00:12:44.038
So it is a thing that has to happen.

00:12:44.239 --> 00:12:47.233
It’s just like an operation which takes place.

00:12:47.434 --> 00:12:50.193
First we used to do is the cleansing of the the people,

00:12:50.394 --> 00:12:51.645
of the chakras, this, that.

00:12:51.846 --> 00:12:53.755
When they are cleansed and have reached a certain position

00:12:53.956 --> 00:12:56.563
then only they were allowed to do my puja.

00:12:56.764 --> 00:12:59.788
But I found that when I came first to America

00:12:59.989 --> 00:13:02.000
I did not talk about puja at all.

00:13:02.208 --> 00:13:03.724
I talked about the abstract things.

00:13:03.925 --> 00:13:05.685
I didn’t want to say about these things.

00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:09.021
We did not do any puja, we did not establish Shri Ganesha,

00:13:09.222 --> 00:13:10.473
nothing of the kind.

00:13:10.674 --> 00:13:14.042
And as a result of that people who came to me got lost.

00:13:14.243 --> 00:13:16.458
I didn’t tell them how to keep their health all right

00:13:16.659 --> 00:13:17.616
or about anything.

00:13:17.817 --> 00:13:19.200
It was just such a short time and

00:13:19.401 --> 00:13:21.710
the whole thing was a bad response from people

00:13:21.911 --> 00:13:24.271
that I thought it better to leave it now.

00:13:24.472 --> 00:13:26.833
But now time has come for all of you

00:13:27.034 --> 00:13:29.454
to have it in a big way because you are all seekers

00:13:29.655 --> 00:13:31.809
and we cannot delay it anymore.

00:13:32.028 --> 00:13:34.683
So come to me without any doubt.

00:13:34.884 --> 00:13:36.716
If you have doubts it’s better that you go away.

00:13:36.917 --> 00:13:39.781
It will be better idea for me and for you also.

00:13:39.982 --> 00:13:42.463
When you’re doubts are removed then you come for the puja.

00:13:42.664 --> 00:13:46.997
Don’t sit here with your doubts, otherwise I will have a headache.

00:13:47.302 --> 00:13:50.403
Apart from that you will have a headache.

00:13:51.708 --> 00:13:54.817
So sit in a very cheerful mood, in a receptive mood

00:13:55.018 --> 00:13:57.770
and see for yourself what happens to you.

00:13:58.053 --> 00:14:00.315
May God bless you.

00:14:03.084 --> 00:14:06.420
Did you tell them what we are going to do or should I tell?

00:14:07.537 --> 00:14:11.068
First we are going to do Shri Ganesha's puja.

00:14:11.553 --> 00:14:16.045
Now Shri ganesha's puja is done

00:14:18.014 --> 00:14:21.107
by washing My feet.

00:14:22.442 --> 00:14:26.076
Everybody is not going to wash, I wish everybody could do

00:14:26.277 --> 00:14:29.521
because with that your hands open out very much better.

00:14:29.722 --> 00:14:31.563
Everybody who came in San Francisco

00:14:31.764 --> 00:14:34.029
washed my feet, felt it very well.

00:14:34.295 --> 00:14:36.811
But we have to have some selection of people

00:14:36.999 --> 00:14:38.977
who we seen are all right,

00:14:39.178 --> 00:14:41.240
they are going to do the worship.

00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:43.397
But the rest of them, I told them

00:14:43.598 --> 00:14:46.521
this water, which is vibrated, you should put it on your head

00:14:46.722 --> 00:14:48.472
to baptise yourself only.

00:14:48.673 --> 00:14:50.360
But nobody should touch that water.

00:14:50.576 --> 00:14:53.864
When that water is washed out when you are taken the thing

00:14:54.073 --> 00:14:56.561
just with the spoon you can put it on the head

00:14:56.762 --> 00:14:58.889
and then with your hand you can rub it.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.388
But, I thing best thing will be to put it on the head a little bit

00:15:02.589 --> 00:15:05.912
and then first in the hand clean it

00:15:06.113 --> 00:15:09.451
and then when you put it on the head you can rub it.

00:15:09.652 --> 00:15:11.732
Because your hands will show all the vibrations means

00:15:11.933 --> 00:15:15.313
using or spoiled or if there is any defect.

00:15:15.514 --> 00:15:18.451
The best is first to wash your hands and the put it on the head

00:15:18.678 --> 00:15:20.076
so that it is cleaned out.

00:15:20.341 --> 00:15:23.006
We are thinking as a precaution because

00:15:23.207 --> 00:15:27.037
is a very fast thing we are doing

00:15:27.238 --> 00:15:28.638
so we are taking a precaution.

00:15:28.839 --> 00:15:31.092
Because is a very fast movement.

00:15:31.293 --> 00:15:34.724
And we have to be fast now, so we have started this thing,

00:15:34.925 --> 00:15:38.295
we may loose some of you, I know that, but doesn't matter.

00:15:38.496 --> 00:15:41.842
Some can be lost but many can be brought up.

00:15:42.043 --> 00:15:43.694
So, it's a big operation

00:15:43.895 --> 00:15:47.271
which I hope carefully done may work out wanders.

00:15:47.903 --> 00:15:49.850
So be careful. And now don't start thinking

00:15:50.051 --> 00:15:51.810
that I may be one of them who'll be lost.

00:15:52.011 --> 00:15:54.196
There are people who are thinking like that

00:16:01.673 --> 00:16:04.774
Also created doubts in your mind about yourself.

00:16:04.975 --> 00:16:06.115
That's the main point of it,

00:16:06.316 --> 00:16:09.255
if you have doubts about yourself you will have problems.

00:16:09.456 --> 00:16:13.117
Don't have doubts about yourself also, that's very important.

00:16:13.421 --> 00:16:15.484
Because if you have doubts about yourself

00:16:15.685 --> 00:16:17.933
then nothing can be worked out.

00:16:18.567 --> 00:16:21.545
So the first thing is the Ganesha.

00:16:21.755 --> 00:16:23.609
Ganesha is the innocence in you

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:27.710
which is very important to be awaken in America. Is very important.

00:16:28.374 --> 00:16:31.984
So the first we are going to do is the Ganesha's puja.

00:16:32.375 --> 00:16:33.468
Innocence.

00:16:33.669 --> 00:16:37.406
And Ganesha incarnated on this earth as Christ,

00:16:37.607 --> 00:16:39.882
which can be proved also through Kundalini awakening,

00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:41.528
we can prove it

00:16:42.086 --> 00:16:46.695
Once that happens to you, that your innocence is awaken

00:16:46.895 --> 00:16:50.484
when your innocence is waken you will be happy to know

00:16:50.685 --> 00:16:54.062
that most of your diseases that come

00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:57.535
from the spoiling of this chakra specialy

00:16:59.328 --> 00:17:03.608
of so many diseases that are like that

00:17:04.045 --> 00:17:07.118
all these bad diseases are [check].

00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:11.407
Ganesha is the greatest power because it is innocent.

00:17:11.608 --> 00:17:15.522
And the innocentce if it is awaken within you

00:17:15.723 --> 00:17:17.796
you become a very powerfull person

00:17:18.012 --> 00:17:22.866
and most of the diseases are sort of cured

00:17:23.074 --> 00:17:24.920
which are connected with this chakra.

00:17:25.152 --> 00:17:26.640
But today is not the time to tell you

00:17:26.841 --> 00:17:29.546
about what the diseases are and how they are checked and all that

00:17:29.746 --> 00:17:32.211
but all the combinations and permutations

00:17:32.412 --> 00:17:34.390
of this chakra with other chakras

00:17:34.608 --> 00:17:40.689
which gives you horrible diseases, incurrable diseases, can be checked

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:44.185
and then how to completely cure them,

00:17:44.386 --> 00:17:47.435
for that you have to know the combination of this.

00:17:47.636 --> 00:17:50.853
When you know the combinations of this then you can check them all

00:17:51.054 --> 00:17:52.466
completely to get it cured.

00:17:52.667 --> 00:17:54.435
But at lest they do not advance anymore,

00:17:54.636 --> 00:17:56.826
whenever they are they completely undercheck

00:17:57.027 --> 00:17:58.497
and gradualy they go down.

00:17:58.698 --> 00:17:59.787
But to expedite it

00:17:59.988 --> 00:18:02.864
you have to understand the complete combinations of centers.

00:18:03.065 --> 00:18:07.450
The chakras, their combinations then what mantras to be said

00:18:07.651 --> 00:18:10.693
how to operate it and everything if you learn

00:18:10.894 --> 00:18:12.122
it takes hardly any time.

00:18:12.323 --> 00:18:15.435
Luckily they have ofered us another time

00:18:15.636 --> 00:18:18.654
[display it] in the end of october, what is the date.

00:18:18.855 --> 00:18:26.075
12 st of october here the people who run the camp like us

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:29.435
and they work with the camp because actualy the camp is closed

00:18:29.636 --> 00:18:31.658
until they considering close it completely.

00:18:31.859 --> 00:18:34.238
They were oposite place, if we wish another seminar

00:18:34.528 --> 00:18:38.856
for the weekend and the 21 st will be an opening date

00:18:39.057 --> 00:18:40.756
so if anyone is realy interested

00:18:40.957 --> 00:18:43.122
let me know before we leave here today,

00:18:43.323 --> 00:18:49.263
so I can tell to the owner of the camp that that will be ok.

00:18:51.198 --> 00:18:54.435
That will be a good idea, that will be aditional help to you

00:18:54.636 --> 00:18:57.253
and there will be people will tell you about this

00:18:57.454 --> 00:18:59.917
because they are all here till one month at least

00:19:00.118 --> 00:19:02.026
so we can work it out that way.

00:19:02.235 --> 00:19:06.239
And then Santa Cruz program we have canceled for the time being,

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.690
because the response in Santa Cruz itself has been very very poor.

00:19:10.891 --> 00:19:13.870
People come for a month or so then they dissapear

00:19:14.071 --> 00:19:15.941
you see, they are very swifty people,

00:19:16.142 --> 00:19:19.487
they take again back to drugs, the have no will power left in them.

00:19:19.697 --> 00:19:22.081
Those people who are settled in Santa Cruz

00:19:22.282 --> 00:19:24.042
they're very few people who have that will power.

00:19:24.243 --> 00:19:28.261
They've become like old people who have no will power in them left

00:19:28.597 --> 00:19:30.964
to stand up to the truth and

00:19:31.165 --> 00:19:34.972
that's how they've shown no results of improvement.

00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:36.772
And this is the only place I think

00:19:36.973 --> 00:19:39.312
where we have that way receided back

00:19:39.513 --> 00:19:40.812
and we have to receide

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.488
like the root had to receide at certain places.

00:19:43.689 --> 00:19:48.704
Then later on, when San Francisco develop into a good center

00:19:48.905 --> 00:19:51.218
people also from Santa Cruz can go there

00:19:51.419 --> 00:19:53.679
because they like to travel. If you make them travel,

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:59.608
make the suffer a little, they like it.

00:19:59.809 --> 00:20:02.288
If you tell them it's all here just now you sitting down

00:20:02.489 --> 00:20:04.718
you'll get it, they say o, that's too much.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.765
That's the nature of american people,

00:20:07.966 --> 00:20:11.128
you see, they want to travel, have some adventure something

00:20:11.329 --> 00:20:13.046
and they want to do like that.

00:20:13.247 --> 00:20:18.168
It's all right, let them travel to San Francisco and suffer a little

00:20:18.348 --> 00:20:20.562
and then get there till settle down.

00:20:20.763 --> 00:20:24.314
Whatever it is San Francisco is going to be a very powerfull center.

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:28.061
And people from Santa Cruz can go there and work it out.

00:20:28.262 --> 00:20:30.476
I think if they can go there,

00:20:30.677 --> 00:20:32.953
then they may develop that earnesness

00:20:33.154 --> 00:20:35.656
to develop it and to settle down.

00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:41.783
So the responsibility is very great on all of you who have come here.

00:20:42.335 --> 00:20:48.099
You all represent here the fundation of Sahaja Yoga in america.

00:20:48.662 --> 00:20:52.913
You are the one who will be held responsible for the emancipation

00:20:53.538 --> 00:20:57.690
of this court specialy.

00:20:58.225 --> 00:21:04.271
That so many, I think at least 60% of the seekers

00:21:04.488 --> 00:21:08.275
are born in this part of the country

00:21:08.476 --> 00:21:12.674
and are there, till 60% of the seekers are here.

00:21:12.983 --> 00:21:16.538
Some of them are lost because they have gone in a very wrong way,

00:21:16.739 --> 00:21:19.612
head lock, but you can save them.

00:21:20.999 --> 00:21:26.046
You can first off all, establish people who are perfectly all right

00:21:26.247 --> 00:21:28.578
then there are someone little bit spoiled,

00:21:28.779 --> 00:21:31.827
then there are some people who can be brought in.

00:21:32.028 --> 00:21:35.757
But those people who are absoultely wrong cases

00:21:35.958 --> 00:21:37.874
you should no worry just now about them.

00:21:38.075 --> 00:21:41.007
You build up all such people together

00:21:41.208 --> 00:21:43.555
and then it will be grater for you

00:21:43.756 --> 00:21:46.780
to pull out all such people who have no will power.

00:21:46.981 --> 00:21:50.038
Because you can give the the will to come out of their problems.

00:21:50.239 --> 00:21:53.585
We have to save all of them,

00:21:53.811 --> 00:21:55.975
try to save all of them.

00:21:56.202 --> 00:21:59.499
It is better that you do it in such a way

00:21:59.700 --> 00:22:01.491
that you first build up your strenght

00:22:01.778 --> 00:22:04.972
and then you try to pull them out.

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:07.218
And we can do it.

00:22:07.538 --> 00:22:10.475
I am very happy to see so many people here.

00:22:10.858 --> 00:22:13.186
I've great hopes now from America.

00:22:13.491 --> 00:22:16.109
And I'm sure you can save this great country

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.711
by which can save the whole humanity.

00:22:19.843 --> 00:22:22.078
This is such a great news for all the sahaja yogis

00:22:22.279 --> 00:22:24.225
all over the world. They are so anctious.

00:22:24.426 --> 00:22:27.858
People have come from India, have come from Australia,

00:22:28.059 --> 00:22:29.647
have come from Europe.

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:32.303
They've come from all over the world,

00:22:32.504 --> 00:22:35.548
from England, and every place they are here

00:22:35.749 --> 00:22:39.398
just to pull out some americans out

00:22:39.599 --> 00:22:41.804
so that then they'll start doing their job.

00:22:42.005 --> 00:22:45.210
Next time we have to export americans.

00:22:49.429 --> 00:22:53.194
May God bless you! May God bless you!

00:22:58.468 --> 00:23:03.282
I wanted to say that one thing one should avoid during puja

00:23:03.483 --> 00:23:06.235
or otherwise also is shalowness.

00:23:06.436 --> 00:23:08.843
You should not get puja on a shalow bussiness.

00:23:09.044 --> 00:23:11.414
Because it works out in a very subtler way.

00:23:11.615 --> 00:23:14.163
So shallowness must be avoided in Sahaja Yoga!

00:23:14.364 --> 00:23:18.392
Shallowness or all the time saying that

00:23:18.593 --> 00:23:20.593
we are new to this , we are new to that.

00:23:20.794 --> 00:23:22.804
There is nothing new because everything is within you.

00:23:23.005 --> 00:23:26.202
It's can be activated. There's nothing new, it's all within you.

00:23:26.403 --> 00:23:29.429
As any indian is, you are, there's no difference whatsoever.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.960
Only thing they have a little advanced that they can understand me

00:23:33.161 --> 00:23:35.903
faster than you can because they have the education.

00:23:36.119 --> 00:23:38.946
But as far as the mechanism is concerned, you are just the same.

00:23:39.192 --> 00:23:41.997
Don't have the idea that you are a new nation

00:23:42.198 --> 00:23:44.606
and all this thing have no meaning at all

00:23:44.807 --> 00:23:48.363
You are ancient people oer seekers of antiquities.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.966
Just don't worry about these things that you are a new nation.

00:23:52.167 --> 00:23:53.449
You were given this nation

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:56.563
because you did such good in your last life.

00:23:56.777 --> 00:23:59.074
May God bless you!
