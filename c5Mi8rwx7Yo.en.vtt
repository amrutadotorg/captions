WEBVTT

01:51.026 --> 01:54.489
When you are all meditating

01:54.690 --> 01:59.675
and inside I also find it difficult to be outside.

02:00.792 --> 02:08.300
So today you have arranged to have this puja here.

02:09.691 --> 02:14.410
Just before that you have to prepare yourself

02:14.611 --> 02:17.449
physically and mentally.

02:18.965 --> 02:23.677
Physically you must give yourself a bandhan

02:23.878 --> 02:26.582
and a bandhan is just nothing but

02:26.783 --> 02:30.925
that you give yourself a protection to your aura.

02:31.126 --> 02:35.230
And how you do it is very simple

02:35.574 --> 02:37.980
which I will tell you just now how to do it

02:38.181 --> 02:44.292
and then you sit down for your puja.

02:44.493 --> 02:47.982
Then mentally you have to put yourself right.

02:48.183 --> 02:52.472
First of all, you should not feel guilty at all.

02:52.730 --> 02:56.824
If you are guilty, you cannot do my puja.

02:57.087 --> 03:01.746
So, you should be absolutely above that.

03:02.011 --> 03:05.222
There should be no tension in your mind.

03:05.488 --> 03:08.746
You are not guilty, you are in the present.

03:08.972 --> 03:11.603
See like flowers you are looking.

03:11.804 --> 03:13.716
How can flowers be guilty?

03:13.917 --> 03:16.052
First get out of that guilt business.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.894
You should not feel guilty or tense.

03:19.113 --> 03:21.448
Everything that is done is the best.

03:21.649 --> 03:23.334
You shouldn’t worry about it.

03:23.535 --> 03:27.012
It’s not your responsibility even to arrange it.

03:27.213 --> 03:30.496
Just think that everything is done sahaj.

03:30.761 --> 03:34.628
Gradually when you’ll move in Sahaja Yoga you’ll be surprised

03:34.878 --> 03:38.933
to see how things are arranged just beautifully.

03:39.160 --> 03:43.089
When these people just were finding out a place

03:43.371 --> 03:48.316
they had no place which was for less than 250$ each.

03:48.519 --> 03:51.243
They said this is rather too much for everybody’s pocket.

03:51.444 --> 03:54.818
And then suddenly, spontaneously they found this place.

03:55.019 --> 03:57.363
When they said 50$ nobody could believe.

03:57.564 --> 04:01.348
They thought that we’ll just get some porridge in the morning

04:01.549 --> 04:04.792
and the rest of it will be fasting.

04:05.084 --> 04:06.943
So many were rather worried,

04:07.152 --> 04:10.340
some thought it was a scout camping ground or whatever it is

04:10.541 --> 04:13.683
and quite worried when it starts raining.

04:13.941 --> 04:17.676
But, see, this is all God’s grace to get such a place,

04:17.877 --> 04:20.910
such a comfortable place for you to come here.

04:21.113 --> 04:24.035
Everything is arranged by God’s grace.

04:24.236 --> 04:25.793
So first we have to remember

04:25.994 --> 04:28.164
that it is all arrange through God's grace

04:28.365 --> 04:30.240
If something is not arranged just forget it,

04:30.441 --> 04:32.494
just leave it, just don’t worry.

04:32.695 --> 04:35.066
That’s the best way, you have to live.

04:35.313 --> 04:39.426
Then what happens is that you become one with the present

04:39.627 --> 04:44.002
and you can overcome all your problems of tension.

04:44.203 --> 04:46.701
Tension mounts up when we want to do

04:46.902 --> 04:48.802
which you are not supposed to do,

04:49.003 --> 04:51.437
which we are not successful.

04:51.638 --> 04:53.496
There is also a mental barrier

04:53.697 --> 04:55.768
between ourselves and our mind

04:55.969 --> 04:58.796
that we want to do a particular thing in a particular way.

04:58.997 --> 05:02.044
If you can give up that, then you will be surprised

05:02.245 --> 05:07.810
that you become absolutely one with the Divine

05:08.011 --> 05:11.723
and you start working it out in a very beautiful manner.

05:11.924 --> 05:15.858
Now see the root of a little seed.

05:16.059 --> 05:19.892
It just sprouts, it goes this way.

05:20.093 --> 05:22.598
If it finds there is an obstruction

05:22.799 --> 05:26.075
ot there is some sort of a stone or something, it goes around it.

05:26.302 --> 05:30.241
Then it finds something other obstruction, it goes away from it.

05:30.442 --> 05:32.021
It doesn’t fight that,

05:32.222 --> 05:34.476
just says, “All right, let me find my own way."

05:34.677 --> 05:39.653
And then he uses the same stone for holding the tree.

05:39.854 --> 05:43.849
So clever, he goes around the

05:45.294 --> 05:49.216
little stone and uses that for its own purpose.

05:49.442 --> 05:52.085
This is how a Sahaja Yogi should behave.

05:52.286 --> 05:56.271
Not to take responsibility and put others into tension:

05:56.472 --> 05:58.285
“This must be done. This is not here."

05:58.486 --> 06:00.565
“That is not there." It’s not necessary.

06:00.766 --> 06:02.851
It’s your love that is important.

06:03.052 --> 06:07.702
For which you must have heard the story of an old woman

06:07.903 --> 06:10.341
who was living in a forest.

06:10.583 --> 06:12.560
Her name was Shavari

06:12.761 --> 06:16.520
and she heard that Shri Ram is going to come in the forest.

06:16.721 --> 06:20.981
And she was so much elated, so much happy.

06:21.223 --> 06:24.184
Such an innocent woman, she didn’t know what to do.

06:24.393 --> 06:27.770
So when Rama came she gave Him,

06:27.997 --> 06:31.661
we have some kind of berry, we called as ber,

06:31.934 --> 06:34.161
she gave them to Him to eat

06:34.362 --> 06:36.700
and she told in very great innocence

06:36.901 --> 06:41.442
that everyone of them I have tested to see that they are not sour.

06:41.677 --> 06:45.809
And she gave them to Him and he ate them so lovingly.

06:46.036 --> 06:49.399
So his brother was a hot-tempered fellow.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.864
He got very angry. He said, “What is this? This lady has no sense.

06:53.065 --> 06:58.265
She is giving all these things which are eaten by her, first of all."

06:58.466 --> 07:00.126
Which we call as uttishtha

07:00.327 --> 07:02.982
means somebody has eaten it, then you are not supposed to eat

07:03.183 --> 07:06.632
even your, say, your brother has eaten something,

07:06.833 --> 07:07.851
you cannot eat that.

07:08.052 --> 07:12.172
It’s regarded as something not good, not auspicious.

07:12.373 --> 07:15.599
"And this lady, an old lady with her few teeth that are left,

07:15.800 --> 07:19.330
she has just pierced every berry and has given to my brother."

07:19.531 --> 07:21.413
Very furious.

07:21.614 --> 07:26.083
So Rama’s wife, Sita, was just smiling at the whole situation

07:26.284 --> 07:28.669
and then Rama gave

07:29.552 --> 07:36.044
Rama gave that berry to his wife and she ate it.

07:36.247 --> 07:40.708
She looked at her brother-in-law and She said: "See brother-in-law

07:40.909 --> 07:43.372
“These are the best berrys I've ever eaten.

07:43.573 --> 07:45.507
I’ve never had such a taste before."

07:45.708 --> 07:47.294
But I’m not going to give you anything."

07:47.495 --> 07:49.677
See, the best way to challenge the ego

07:49.878 --> 07:52.521
is not to say that you are not going to have it.

07:52.697 --> 07:54.763
He said, “Why?” “No, I won’t give you.

07:54.964 --> 07:57.669
You won’t have them, I will not. I will eat all of them."

07:57.870 --> 08:00.235
Then He said, “No, how can you eat all of that?”

08:00.436 --> 08:03.427
He snatched some of them and he ate and also felt the same thing.

08:03.638 --> 08:06.482
Because they are given out of love.

08:06.683 --> 08:08.724
Whatever is done out of love

08:08.925 --> 08:11.419
is a thousand-fold better

08:11.620 --> 08:14.143
than that is done out of tension and problem.

08:14.395 --> 08:19.233
I should never like to cause any tension in your mind of any kind.

08:19.434 --> 08:21.702
So for small, small things you should not worry.

08:21.903 --> 08:24.560
You must give up your tensions absolutely

08:24.761 --> 08:28.997
and understand that you are the children of God.

08:29.211 --> 08:30.520
You are to be looked after.

08:30.721 --> 08:34.218
You are to given everything that is available in His realm.

08:34.419 --> 08:36.309
You should not get into tension at all.

08:36.510 --> 08:38.591
Firstly, not to feel guilty,

08:38.792 --> 08:41.552
thirdly to feel that we had to go to this guru, that guru.

08:41.753 --> 08:43.114
All right, forget it.

08:43.315 --> 08:46.348
Forget it. Whatever has happened has happened. Forget it!

08:46.549 --> 08:48.106
Don’t worry on that point also

08:48.307 --> 08:50.317
because that will tie you down all the time saying,

08:50.518 --> 08:52.059
“Why did you go to that guru?

08:52.260 --> 08:54.638
Why did you pay money to this fellow?”

08:54.839 --> 08:55.994
Why did you do this?

08:56.195 --> 08:59.473
Just tell your mind, “I am not bothered.

08:59.674 --> 09:01.233
I am not bothered."

09:01.434 --> 09:03.824
Whatever has happened, has happened that person is finished.

09:04.025 --> 09:05.991
Now whatever my egg has done, now I am a bird.

09:06.192 --> 09:07.078
I have nothing to do."

09:07.279 --> 09:09.290
So be in the present, that is very important.

09:09.491 --> 09:12.591
Be in the present, have no guilt,

09:12.833 --> 09:14.552
have no worries of the past

09:14.753 --> 09:18.882
because if you worry of the past you can never enjoy the present.

09:19.169 --> 09:22.042
And you are here to enjoy and not to worry about the past.

09:22.250 --> 09:25.254
What ever has happend, has happend, just forget it.

09:25.575 --> 09:27.747
I hope you understand this very well

09:27.948 --> 09:31.144
and to forget whatever has happened and forgive.

09:31.345 --> 09:33.509
There are Sahaja Yogis with you. Enjoy life.

09:33.710 --> 09:36.107
Always try to see the good points of other Sahaja Yogis

09:36.308 --> 09:37.850
and not the bad points.

09:38.051 --> 09:41.138
Normally we try to find out what’s wrong with another person,

09:41.339 --> 09:43.890
especially when we know about chakras.

09:44.091 --> 09:47.694
We just understand that this person has got these very bad chakras.

09:47.895 --> 09:50.348
Then the only thing what to do is to give yourself a bandhan,

09:50.549 --> 09:52.681
which I will tell you, and deal with the person.

09:52.882 --> 09:55.122
But when you know that person has this sickness

09:55.323 --> 09:56.722
or this kind of a chakra caught up,

09:56.923 --> 09:59.351
no use arguing, no use telling them.

09:59.552 --> 10:01.515
Let them come up, they’ll come right.

10:01.716 --> 10:03.202
Tell them that this is what it is.

10:03.403 --> 10:07.612
At the most you can tell your children, you can tell your wife.

10:07.813 --> 10:11.568
Someone, but somebody who is not that closely connected,

10:11.769 --> 10:14.371
you cannot put Sahaja Yoga into their heads.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.645
You cannot force Sahaja Yoga in to them.

10:16.846 --> 10:20.608
Sahaja Yoga cannot be forced into anyone whatsoever.

10:20.809 --> 10:23.188
It has to be accepted, ask for it.

10:23.389 --> 10:24.794
It has its own protocol.

10:24.997 --> 10:29.052
It cannot be just poured into your mouth,

10:29.253 --> 10:31.569
that you’d better have it, is a wrong thing.

10:31.770 --> 10:34.794
There are some people who still have lots of doubts,

10:34.995 --> 10:37.898
I know that, who are sitting here who have doubts.

10:38.099 --> 10:39.365
These should go away.

10:39.566 --> 10:41.960
Then because then they feel guilty, “I have doubts."

10:42.161 --> 10:45.187
Please get rid of those doubts if possible

10:45.388 --> 10:47.927
because I do not want that you should feel later on that,

10:48.128 --> 10:49.520
“Oh, Mother, we doubted you."

10:49.721 --> 10:52.569
Just now better get rid of the doubts.

10:52.770 --> 10:54.271
One thing that one should understand

10:54.472 --> 10:56.122
that Mataji has nothing to gain for us.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.193
We cannot give her anything.

10:58.394 --> 10:59.890
We cannot give her anything.

11:00.091 --> 11:01.989
Only we have to take from Her.

11:02.190 --> 11:04.607
If you understand that then you’ll have no doubts

11:04.808 --> 11:06.562
because that is one of the fears people have.

11:06.763 --> 11:09.593
That I’m going to start having something from you.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.731
So once you understand that She has nothing to take away from us,

11:12.932 --> 11:15.085
She has to give us something.

11:15.286 --> 11:18.645
Supposing I say there is a diamond available here free for you,

11:18.856 --> 11:20.187
will you doubt me?

11:20.388 --> 11:23.942
You’ll say, “All right, let’s see if it’s a diamond or a fake, clutch it.

11:24.192 --> 11:26.273
That’s how your attitude should be.

11:26.489 --> 11:29.435
So those who have doubts should know that with the doubts

11:29.636 --> 11:33.536
they will go very slow and they may be thrown out.

11:33.755 --> 11:35.874
So please don’t have any doubts.

11:36.075 --> 11:39.077
A doubting mind is the most troublesome thing.

11:39.278 --> 11:43.083
It will never allow you to enjoy your spirit.

11:43.341 --> 11:45.476
There is no need to doubt about it.

11:45.677 --> 11:49.122
This is opened everything is so open,

11:49.323 --> 11:51.786
there is no secret about it.

11:51.997 --> 11:55.786
You understand that and try to imbibe

11:56.138 --> 11:58.505
the quality of a good Sahaja Yogi,

11:58.706 --> 12:01.660
of a Sahaja Yogi who is steady.

12:01.861 --> 12:04.841
By doubting, the steadiness will go away

12:05.042 --> 12:09.283
and if a tree is not steady how will it imbed itself?

12:09.484 --> 12:12.452
It’s important that you should give up all doubts.

12:12.653 --> 12:15.366
You are so quickly into it.

12:15.567 --> 12:18.247
Seldom we do such a thing, too much of a thing,

12:18.448 --> 12:21.513
I mean never done like that before. It’s an experiment.

12:21.739 --> 12:23.726
We want to see now how it works out.

12:23.927 --> 12:24.811
It’s really an experiment.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.176
We have never done like this before.

12:26.377 --> 12:28.081
It’s a very dangerous thing.

12:28.282 --> 12:31.333
I’ve seen it that people who get into puja

12:31.534 --> 12:34.358
then they might get little stomach pain or something,

12:34.559 --> 12:37.357
or something will happen to you by which you will be cleared out,

12:37.558 --> 12:38.624
little bit.

12:38.825 --> 12:41.715
Not much but then you’ll feel much better out of that.

12:41.916 --> 12:44.038
So it is a thing that has to happen.

12:44.239 --> 12:47.233
It’s just like an operation which takes place.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.193
First we used to do is the cleansing of the the people,

12:50.394 --> 12:51.645
of the chakras, this, that.

12:51.846 --> 12:53.755
When they are cleansed and have reached a certain position

12:53.956 --> 12:56.563
then only they were allowed to do my puja.

12:56.764 --> 12:59.788
But I found that when I came first to America

12:59.989 --> 13:02.000
I did not talk about puja at all.

13:02.208 --> 13:03.724
I talked about the abstract things.

13:03.925 --> 13:05.685
I didn’t want to say about these things.

13:05.886 --> 13:09.021
We did not do any puja, we did not establish Shri Ganesha,

13:09.222 --> 13:10.473
nothing of the kind.

13:10.674 --> 13:14.042
And as a result of that people who came to me got lost.

13:14.243 --> 13:16.458
I didn’t tell them how to keep their health all right

13:16.659 --> 13:17.616
or about anything.

13:17.817 --> 13:19.200
It was just such a short time and

13:19.401 --> 13:21.710
the whole thing was a bad response from people

13:21.911 --> 13:24.271
that I thought it better to leave it now.

13:24.472 --> 13:26.833
But now time has come for all of you

13:27.034 --> 13:29.454
to have it in a big way because you are all seekers

13:29.655 --> 13:31.809
and we cannot delay it anymore.

13:32.028 --> 13:34.683
So come to me without any doubt.

13:34.884 --> 13:36.716
If you have doubts it’s better that you go away.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.781
It will be better idea for me and for you also.

13:39.982 --> 13:42.463
When you’re doubts are removed then you come for the puja.

13:42.664 --> 13:46.997
Don’t sit here with your doubts, otherwise I will have a headache.

13:47.302 --> 13:50.403
Apart from that you will have a headache.

13:51.708 --> 13:54.817
So sit in a very cheerful mood, in a receptive mood

13:55.018 --> 13:57.770
and see for yourself what happens to you.

13:58.053 --> 14:00.315
May God bless you.

14:03.084 --> 14:06.420
Did you tell them what we are going to do or should I tell?

14:07.537 --> 14:11.068
First we are going to do Shri Ganesha's puja.

14:11.553 --> 14:16.045
Now Shri ganesha's puja is done

14:18.014 --> 14:21.107
by washing My feet.

14:22.442 --> 14:26.076
Everybody is not going to wash, I wish everybody could do

14:26.277 --> 14:29.521
because with that your hands open out very much better.

14:29.722 --> 14:31.563
Everybody who came in San Francisco

14:31.764 --> 14:34.029
washed my feet, felt it very well.

14:34.295 --> 14:36.811
But we have to have some selection of people

14:36.999 --> 14:38.977
who we seen are all right,

14:39.178 --> 14:41.240
they are going to do the worship.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.397
But the rest of them, I told them

14:43.598 --> 14:46.521
this water, which is vibrated, you should put it on your head

14:46.722 --> 14:48.472
to baptise yourself only.

14:48.673 --> 14:50.360
But nobody should touch that water.

14:50.576 --> 14:53.864
When that water is washed out when you are taken the thing

14:54.073 --> 14:56.561
just with the spoon you can put it on the head

14:56.762 --> 14:58.889
and then with your hand you can rub it.

14:59.090 --> 15:02.388
But, I thing best thing will be to put it on the head a little bit

15:02.589 --> 15:05.912
and then first in the hand clean it

15:06.113 --> 15:09.451
and then when you put it on the head you can rub it.

15:09.652 --> 15:11.732
Because your hands will show all the vibrations means

15:11.933 --> 15:15.313
using or spoiled or if there is any defect.

15:15.514 --> 15:18.451
The best is first to wash your hands and the put it on the head

15:18.678 --> 15:20.076
so that it is cleaned out.

15:20.341 --> 15:23.006
We are thinking as a precaution because

15:23.207 --> 15:27.037
is a very fast thing we are doing

15:27.238 --> 15:28.638
so we are taking a precaution.

15:28.839 --> 15:31.092
Because is a very fast movement.

15:31.293 --> 15:34.724
And we have to be fast now, so we have started this thing,

15:34.925 --> 15:38.295
we may loose some of you, I know that, but doesn't matter.

15:38.496 --> 15:41.842
Some can be lost but many can be brought up.

15:42.043 --> 15:43.694
So, it's a big operation

15:43.895 --> 15:47.271
which I hope carefully done may work out wanders.

15:47.903 --> 15:49.850
So be careful. And now don't start thinking

15:50.051 --> 15:51.810
that I may be one of them who'll be lost.

15:52.011 --> 15:54.196
There are people who are thinking like that

16:01.673 --> 16:04.774
Also created doubts in your mind about yourself.

16:04.975 --> 16:06.115
That's the main point of it,

16:06.316 --> 16:09.255
if you have doubts about yourself you will have problems.

16:09.456 --> 16:13.117
Don't have doubts about yourself also, that's very important.

16:13.421 --> 16:15.484
Because if you have doubts about yourself

16:15.685 --> 16:17.933
then nothing can be worked out.

16:18.567 --> 16:21.545
So the first thing is the Ganesha.

16:21.755 --> 16:23.609
Ganesha is the innocence in you

16:23.810 --> 16:27.710
which is very important to be awaken in America. Is very important.

16:28.374 --> 16:31.984
So the first we are going to do is the Ganesha's puja.

16:32.375 --> 16:33.468
Innocence.

16:33.669 --> 16:37.406
And Ganesha incarnated on this earth as Christ,

16:37.607 --> 16:39.882
which can be proved also through Kundalini awakening,

16:40.083 --> 16:41.528
we can prove it

16:42.086 --> 16:46.695
Once that happens to you, that your innocence is awaken

16:46.895 --> 16:50.484
when your innocence is waken you will be happy to know

16:50.685 --> 16:54.062
that most of your diseases that come

16:54.263 --> 16:57.535
from the spoiling of this chakra specialy

16:59.328 --> 17:03.608
of so many diseases that are like that

17:04.045 --> 17:07.118
all these bad diseases are [check].

17:07.429 --> 17:11.407
Ganesha is the greatest power because it is innocent.

17:11.608 --> 17:15.522
And the innocentce if it is awaken within you

17:15.723 --> 17:17.796
you become a very powerfull person

17:18.012 --> 17:22.866
and most of the diseases are sort of cured

17:23.074 --> 17:24.920
which are connected with this chakra.

17:25.152 --> 17:26.640
But today is not the time to tell you

17:26.841 --> 17:29.546
about what the diseases are and how they are checked and all that

17:29.746 --> 17:32.211
but all the combinations and permutations

17:32.412 --> 17:34.390
of this chakra with other chakras

17:34.608 --> 17:40.689
which gives you horrible diseases, incurrable diseases, can be checked

17:40.890 --> 17:44.185
and then how to completely cure them,

17:44.386 --> 17:47.435
for that you have to know the combination of this.

17:47.636 --> 17:50.853
When you know the combinations of this then you can check them all

17:51.054 --> 17:52.466
completely to get it cured.

17:52.667 --> 17:54.435
But at lest they do not advance anymore,

17:54.636 --> 17:56.826
whenever they are they completely undercheck

17:57.027 --> 17:58.497
and gradualy they go down.

17:58.698 --> 17:59.787
But to expedite it

17:59.988 --> 18:02.864
you have to understand the complete combinations of centers.

18:03.065 --> 18:07.450
The chakras, their combinations then what mantras to be said

18:07.651 --> 18:10.693
how to operate it and everything if you learn

18:10.894 --> 18:12.122
it takes hardly any time.

18:12.323 --> 18:15.435
Luckily they have ofered us another time

18:15.636 --> 18:18.654
[display it] in the end of october, what is the date.

18:18.855 --> 18:26.075
12 st of october here the people who run the camp like us

18:26.490 --> 18:29.435
and they work with the camp because actualy the camp is closed

18:29.636 --> 18:31.658
until they considering close it completely.

18:31.859 --> 18:34.238
They were oposite place, if we wish another seminar

18:34.528 --> 18:38.856
for the weekend and the 21 st will be an opening date

18:39.057 --> 18:40.756
so if anyone is realy interested

18:40.957 --> 18:43.122
let me know before we leave here today,

18:43.323 --> 18:49.263
so I can tell to the owner of the camp that that will be ok.

18:51.198 --> 18:54.435
That will be a good idea, that will be aditional help to you

18:54.636 --> 18:57.253
and there will be people will tell you about this

18:57.454 --> 18:59.917
because they are all here till one month at least

19:00.118 --> 19:02.026
so we can work it out that way.

19:02.235 --> 19:06.239
And then Santa Cruz program we have canceled for the time being,

19:06.440 --> 19:10.690
because the response in Santa Cruz itself has been very very poor.

19:10.891 --> 19:13.870
People come for a month or so then they dissapear

19:14.071 --> 19:15.941
you see, they are very swifty people,

19:16.142 --> 19:19.487
they take again back to drugs, the have no will power left in them.

19:19.697 --> 19:22.081
Those people who are settled in Santa Cruz

19:22.282 --> 19:24.042
they're very few people who have that will power.

19:24.243 --> 19:28.261
They've become like old people who have no will power in them left

19:28.597 --> 19:30.964
to stand up to the truth and

19:31.165 --> 19:34.972
that's how they've shown no results of improvement.

19:35.173 --> 19:36.772
And this is the only place I think

19:36.973 --> 19:39.312
where we have that way receided back

19:39.513 --> 19:40.812
and we have to receide

19:41.013 --> 19:43.488
like the root had to receide at certain places.

19:43.689 --> 19:48.704
Then later on, when San Francisco develop into a good center

19:48.905 --> 19:51.218
people also from Santa Cruz can go there

19:51.419 --> 19:53.679
because they like to travel. If you make them travel,

19:53.880 --> 19:59.608
make the suffer a little, they like it.

19:59.809 --> 20:02.288
If you tell them it's all here just now you sitting down

20:02.489 --> 20:04.718
you'll get it, they say o, that's too much.

20:05.780 --> 20:07.765
That's the nature of american people,

20:07.966 --> 20:11.128
you see, they want to travel, have some adventure something

20:11.329 --> 20:13.046
and they want to do like that.

20:13.247 --> 20:18.168
It's all right, let them travel to San Francisco and suffer a little

20:18.348 --> 20:20.562
and then get there till settle down.

20:20.763 --> 20:24.314
Whatever it is San Francisco is going to be a very powerfull center.

20:24.515 --> 20:28.061
And people from Santa Cruz can go there and work it out.

20:28.262 --> 20:30.476
I think if they can go there,

20:30.677 --> 20:32.953
then they may develop that earnesness

20:33.154 --> 20:35.656
to develop it and to settle down.

20:37.671 --> 20:41.783
So the responsibility is very great on all of you who have come here.

20:42.335 --> 20:48.099
You all represent here the fundation of Sahaja Yoga in america.

20:48.662 --> 20:52.913
You are the one who will be held responsible for the emancipation

20:53.538 --> 20:57.690
of this court specialy.

20:58.225 --> 21:04.271
That so many, I think at least 60% of the seekers

21:04.488 --> 21:08.275
are born in this part of the country

21:08.476 --> 21:12.674
and are there, till 60% of the seekers are here.

21:12.983 --> 21:16.538
Some of them are lost because they have gone in a very wrong way,

21:16.739 --> 21:19.612
head lock, but you can save them.

21:20.999 --> 21:26.046
You can first off all, establish people who are perfectly all right

21:26.247 --> 21:28.578
then there are someone little bit spoiled,

21:28.779 --> 21:31.827
then there are some people who can be brought in.

21:32.028 --> 21:35.757
But those people who are absoultely wrong cases

21:35.958 --> 21:37.874
you should no worry just now about them.

21:38.075 --> 21:41.007
You build up all such people together

21:41.208 --> 21:43.555
and then it will be grater for you

21:43.756 --> 21:46.780
to pull out all such people who have no will power.

21:46.981 --> 21:50.038
Because you can give the the will to come out of their problems.

21:50.239 --> 21:53.585
We have to save all of them,

21:53.811 --> 21:55.975
try to save all of them.

21:56.202 --> 21:59.499
It is better that you do it in such a way

21:59.700 --> 22:01.491
that you first build up your strenght

22:01.778 --> 22:04.972
and then you try to pull them out.

22:05.257 --> 22:07.218
And we can do it.

22:07.538 --> 22:10.475
I am very happy to see so many people here.

22:10.858 --> 22:13.186
I've great hopes now from America.

22:13.491 --> 22:16.109
And I'm sure you can save this great country

22:16.310 --> 22:18.711
by which can save the whole humanity.

22:19.843 --> 22:22.078
This is such a great news for all the sahaja yogis

22:22.279 --> 22:24.225
all over the world. They are so anctious.

22:24.426 --> 22:27.858
People have come from India, have come from Australia,

22:28.059 --> 22:29.647
have come from Europe.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.303
They've come from all over the world,

22:32.504 --> 22:35.548
from England, and every place they are here

22:35.749 --> 22:39.398
just to pull out some americans out

22:39.599 --> 22:41.804
so that then they'll start doing their job.

22:42.005 --> 22:45.210
Next time we have to export americans.

22:49.429 --> 22:53.194
May God bless you! May God bless you!

22:58.468 --> 23:03.282
I wanted to say that one thing one should avoid during puja

23:03.483 --> 23:06.235
or otherwise also is shalowness.

23:06.436 --> 23:08.843
You should not get puja on a shalow bussiness.

23:09.044 --> 23:11.414
Because it works out in a very subtler way.

23:11.615 --> 23:14.163
So shallowness must be avoided in Sahaja Yoga!

23:14.364 --> 23:18.392
Shallowness or all the time saying that

23:18.593 --> 23:20.593
we are new to this , we are new to that.

23:20.794 --> 23:22.804
There is nothing new because everything is within you.

23:23.005 --> 23:26.202
It's can be activated. There's nothing new, it's all within you.

23:26.403 --> 23:29.429
As any indian is, you are, there's no difference whatsoever.

23:29.630 --> 23:32.960
Only thing they have a little advanced that they can understand me

23:33.161 --> 23:35.903
faster than you can because they have the education.

23:36.119 --> 23:38.946
But as far as the mechanism is concerned, you are just the same.

23:39.192 --> 23:41.997
Don't have the idea that you are a new nation

23:42.198 --> 23:44.606
and all this thing have no meaning at all

23:44.807 --> 23:48.363
You are ancient people oer seekers of antiquities.

23:48.580 --> 23:51.966
Just don't worry about these things that you are a new nation.

23:52.167 --> 23:53.449
You were given this nation

23:53.650 --> 23:56.563
because you did such good in your last life.

23:56.777 --> 23:59.074
May God bless you!
