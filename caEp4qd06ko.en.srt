00:00:51,823 --> 00:01:01,735
Public Program, 26 April 1999
Levent Kırca and Oya Basar Theatre, Istanbul (Turkey)

2
00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:03,177
I bow to all the seekers  of truth.

3
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:18,098
 We are at the time bond, is very important.

4
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:26,996
At this time there is so much of turmoils,

5
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,625
so much of problems, so many wars,

6
00:03:30,702 --> 00:03:39,016
all kinds of interrogation has taken place in our value system.

7
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:57,898
And we are quite shocked about that, very much shocked.

8
00:04:04,763 --> 00:04:08,882
What is the problem?

9
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:12,536
Why this is happening?

10
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:15,460
We should try to find out.

11
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:26,082
And if there is a solution
we should try to achieve it.

12
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:36,607
The problems are there because
human beings do not know themselves.

13
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:47,405
Either they think too much of themselves,

14
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,765
they have too much of Ego or
 they are very much conditioned.

15
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:08,442
There is no conditioning

16
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:12,278
that we can say  is not troublesome,

17
00:05:22,171 --> 00:05:26,402
because they blindly accept all the nonsense.

18
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:38,976
Now we  see the problem, say
we are born in particular religion

19
00:05:44,487 --> 00:05:50,472
and we just start following everything that is told to us.

20
00:05:58,386 --> 00:06:03,743
I ask people if they have read Quran Sharif

21
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,627
Very few have really read

22
00:06:14,831 --> 00:06:19,530
 and is completely, sometimes, I find is represented.

23
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:31,039
That brings bad name to Islam, also to Muhammad Sahab.

24
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:53,549
According to us prophet  Muhammad was a very, very great soul.

25
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:08,740
We call him as Adi Guru, means one of the
primordial masters who got birth on this Earth.

26
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:24,070
Now such a great soul like him would not say he is divine.

27
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:28,318
I can not believe that,
but he did not say once divine.

28
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:38,686
Maybe because if somebody says he is Divine,

29
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:42,976
then peoplejust get  after the life of a  divine personality.

30
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:56,256
And it is how much he was tortured,

31
00:07:56,313 --> 00:08:00,506
how much he was troubled, endless.

32
00:08:09,518 --> 00:08:14,289
No one may  say why should such a Divine person suffered,

33
00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:18,140
he did not suffered but he had sufferings

34
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:22,188
even by people who were ignorant,

35
00:08:35,105 --> 00:08:39,764
because they were absolutely blind.

36
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,616
They didn't  know  what sort of a great person he was.

37
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,901
All such great saints had suffer.

38
00:09:02,402 --> 00:09:06,018
All over the world the saints had suffered

39
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:17,988
because the people do not know what saintliness is.

40
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,293
First of all they should know themselves.

41
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:37,272
Once they know themselves,
 they will know what Muhammad Sahab was.

42
00:09:45,256 --> 00:09:49,372
They will also know about Quran-ı Sharif
(Sharif -Holy, honorable).

43
00:09:53,137 --> 00:09:58,440
It is absolutely clear cut in the Qur’an,

44
00:09:58,523 --> 00:10:03,104
but people  want to listen the pret,
you can not help it.

45
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:17,102
Christ also said that know thy self.

46
00:10:22,945 --> 00:10:30,551
All those, who were so great,
 had told to know ourselves.

47
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,632
Those who had not known themselves, have no right

48
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,192
to talk about them or to condemn them
or to say horrible things.

49
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:03,307
After you have come to know yourself only,

50
00:11:03,323 --> 00:11:06,763
you will know how great they were

51
00:11:13,858 --> 00:11:18,748
and how Quran Sharif is such an important book.

52
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:31,728
Even those who read such a great book

53
00:11:31,753 --> 00:11:35,564
are doing all kinds of nonsensical things .

54
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,253
They have no control over their greed.

55
00:11:50,615 --> 00:11:53,712
They have no control over their lust,

56
00:11:56,955 --> 00:11:59,569
they can be very cruel also.

57
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,613
How can that be?

58
00:12:07,484 --> 00:12:11,628
If you read such a great book like Quran Sharif,

59
00:12:11,653 --> 00:12:14,924
then how can you be like that?

60
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:25,833
Because  all this reading does not go in the heart.

61
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:39,176
He has talked about Rahmet (mercy, clemency),
he called it Rahim (compassionate, forgiving) .

62
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,678
Where is that Rahmet?

63
00:12:54,838 --> 00:12:57,666
If do you see that  anywhere?

64
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:05,320
They are all killing each other in the name of God.

65
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:17,023
So this is the state of the truth,
of reality, of divinity.

66
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:28,383
Now what is needed is first to know thy self.

67
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:39,910
For that, it is placed within you,
 in the triangle bone,

68
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,137
this special power  called as Kundalini,

69
00:13:45,489 --> 00:13:52,666
whether you are a Hindu, Muslim, Christian, anything.

70
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:03,856
As they have a heart, they also have this power.

71
00:14:08,038 --> 00:14:11,172
Then how can we say we are different?

72
00:14:15,577 --> 00:14:18,444
We are all human begins, no doubt.

73
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:27,105
But the power of the saint is in every human being.

74
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:35,745
So we have to accept that we all can ascent

75
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:39,297
whether we follow this religion, or that religion,

76
00:14:39,316 --> 00:14:42,508
or this country, or that country,
 makes no difference.

77
00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:55,709
It's written in  Quran Sharif also

78
00:14:55,757 --> 00:14:59,147
it is not only my words, it is written everywhere

79
00:14:59,172 --> 00:15:02,996
that we all human beings are the same.

80
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:15,823
If so, if that is the situation,

81
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:20,048
then why  should we all not know ourselves.

82
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:31,390
It is very easy to know yourself in these modern times,

83
00:15:36,658 --> 00:15:38,283
It has been the esteem

84
00:15:38,308 --> 00:15:43,545
 that  in these modern times we should know ourselves.

85
00:15:51,713 --> 00:15:55,659
You have to have the Self knowledge.

86
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:07,248
You have knowledge of everything outside
what about your Self?

87
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:19,724
When you will know your Self you will be amazed

88
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:26,745
that you all are part and parcel of one great personality, Upper.

89
00:16:38,392 --> 00:16:42,209
When we say “Allah hu Akbar
(Lord, the Biggest)”

90
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:46,936
what do we say is that we are one,

91
00:16:46,961 --> 00:16:50,845
in one personality that is Upper.

92
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:08,151
Just by think “Allah hu Akbar”, you do not realized,

93
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:13,196
you do not become part and parcel of the great Upper.

94
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:25,595
You go out shouting for ages, for centuries,

95
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:30,157
you will not become part and parcel of Upper.

96
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:43,356
For that you have to know yourself

97
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:50,403
and that you have to get connected to
this all pervading Power of Ruh (Spirit).

98
00:18:02,221 --> 00:18:05,705
You have some Sufis,
 but nobody believed them

99
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:08,628
because they were realized souls.

100
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:22,560
Especially in your country, you had such a great people

101
00:18:22,585 --> 00:18:26,719
who came to tell you that you should know yourself ,

102
00:18:35,139 --> 00:18:40,290
but we got lost, in these modern times
we got lost, completely.

103
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:48,867
Where are we?

104
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:56,892
What are we fighting for?

105
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:07,180
How can blind fight,

106
00:19:10,487 --> 00:19:12,640
we do not  know anything,

107
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,397
we do not know  our meaning.

108
00:19:20,634 --> 00:19:22,784
How is possible?

109
00:19:23,009 --> 00:19:28,455
It is very much possible for you all to get your

110
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,272
self realization, self knowledge, to know yourself.

111
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:46,152
Even if you are fanatics, listen to me.

112
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:54,081
Because this will  save you, save your children,

113
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:58,802
 save everyone, save Turkey and save the whole world.

114
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:11,516
You have to raise  about this limited ideas,

115
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:14,486
that you get from others.

116
00:20:25,618 --> 00:20:29,927
You have to have a feeling,

117
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,763
the experience of  this Ruh.

118
00:20:38,767 --> 00:20:46,023
Without that , you cannot know anything
about prophet Muhammad or Islam.

119
00:20:55,761 --> 00:20:58,720
 Islam is to surrender,

120
00:21:01,712 --> 00:21:04,575
 it doesn't mean  aggression.

121
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:15,248
Surrender to who?

122
00:21:17,664 --> 00:21:21,586
 To God, to his power,

123
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,382
which is the power of love.

124
00:21:31,443 --> 00:21:33,403
God loved us,

125
00:21:33,523 --> 00:21:36,181
so he created us.

126
00:21:41,746 --> 00:21:46,074
If we haven't got that power of love,

127
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,495
if we haven't just  his power of love ,

128
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,689
no use during any namaz or anything no use.

129
00:22:05,584 --> 00:22:08,703
The namaz (daily Muslim worshiping) you do is nothing,

130
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,880
but for your Kundalini awakening.

131
00:22:20,908 --> 00:22:23,511
You will realize that

132
00:22:23,536 --> 00:22:26,509
after your Self Knowledge,

133
00:22:26,914 --> 00:22:31,242
even if you do namaz it has great meaning.

134
00:22:40,544 --> 00:22:44,901
Once you start feeling this cool breeze

135
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:47,412
after Holy Ghost as they call it,

136
00:22:47,548 --> 00:22:49,897
or you  can say this Ruh,

137
00:22:50,225 --> 00:22:56,521
then when you do namaz it goes on increasing,
you go on

138
00:22:57,731 --> 00:23:00,367
becoming higher and higher.

139
00:23:11,249 --> 00:23:15,312
Otherwise, any number of namaz can you do,

140
00:23:15,337 --> 00:23:18,822
  rouse are you do, you can not do it.

141
00:23:28,403 --> 00:23:33,482
And a seed has to be sprout,

142
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:36,210
otherwise it cannot grow.

143
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:47,078
In the same way your Kundalini has to be awaken

144
00:23:47,103 --> 00:23:49,954
 like a primula  of a seed.
(brightly coloured flowers in the spring)

145
00:23:57,178 --> 00:24:02,951
Without this sprouting,
 how can you grow, artificially?

146
00:24:08,896 --> 00:24:15,016
So please understand that first let this sprouting things

147
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:24,567
and then you do namaz,

148
00:24:24,718 --> 00:24:27,849
and you will be amazed that

149
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,415
 the chaitanya work on

150
00:24:30,449 --> 00:24:35,150
vibrations there  are flowing increase tremendously.

151
00:24:49,016 --> 00:24:52,156
Also then you read Qur’an

152
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:56,516
and these vibrations will increase tremendously!

153
00:25:03,683 --> 00:25:06,738
You will grow very fast.

154
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,531
All the things that you do in the name of God,

155
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:18,216
you will have the experience

156
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,905
that are all true, there is truth in it.

157
00:25:29,184 --> 00:25:34,886
But you have to allow the seed to be sprout.

158
00:25:38,685 --> 00:25:46,264
Without that you are just like any other  material.

159
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:58,125
Something artificial living in the false world,

160
00:25:58,582 --> 00:26:01,693
doing all kinds of wrong things

161
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:07,245
without bothering about God Almighty.

162
00:26:17,147 --> 00:26:18,890
Not only that you will know your Self,

163
00:26:18,915 --> 00:26:23,806
 but you will know all the powers that
get out of that knowledge.

164
00:26:34,656 --> 00:26:40,920
The first power you get is of tremendously creativity.

165
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:51,157
As it is Turkish are known for their  creativity,

166
00:26:57,602 --> 00:27:01,939
they will create  such a beautiful art

167
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:07,831
 that it will be appealing to the
whole world on Global level.

168
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:25,657
Now you become extremely moral by nature.

169
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:35,919
You do not have to be very rigid about this,

170
00:27:36,626 --> 00:27:40,797
 you just become you become very moral.

171
00:27:49,643 --> 00:27:53,161
Whatever is said  “don’t do this, don’t do that!”,

172
00:27:53,193 --> 00:27:56,209
nothing is to be told;

173
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:06,761
 because your Spirit is now enlightened

174
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:15,009
and in the blank of that spirit
you know what is good for you,

175
00:28:15,015 --> 00:28:16,930
and what is distracting for you.

176
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:30,102
Now Muhammed said not to drink alcohol,

177
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:32,763
we do not say do not drink ,

178
00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:43,980
because if I say that half of the people will just go away.

179
00:28:50,823 --> 00:28:54,267
 But after you get this knowledge

180
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:57,114
 which is constructive for yourself ,

181
00:28:57,147 --> 00:28:59,760
you yourself do not drink,

182
00:28:59,785 --> 00:29:02,332
 you do not take any alcohol,

183
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,774
 you do not take any drug,
 you do not smoke,

184
00:29:04,822 --> 00:29:08,723
 you do not take anything
 that can destroy your body.

185
00:29:21,402 --> 00:29:23,942
You do not have to tell your children

186
00:29:23,967 --> 00:29:28,055
 “do this, do that” , it works out automatically.

187
00:29:33,344 --> 00:29:37,851
It is very surprising how powerful you become,

188
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,753
 that you do not have to do anything

189
00:29:41,803 --> 00:29:45,263
 to stop yourself of doing something wrong.

190
00:29:57,949 --> 00:30:00,933
 Then you become very sensitive

191
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:03,644
as to what is right and what is wrong

192
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:07,343
and you just do not accept that is wrong.

193
00:30:15,624 --> 00:30:21,753
 This discrimination  is just within you,
 which is enlightened.

194
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:36,817
Then for everything: for food, for

195
00:30:36,984 --> 00:30:41,830
taking out money, this -that, all this greed business

196
00:30:41,983 --> 00:30:44,086
 just get controlled.

197
00:30:54,076 --> 00:30:59,576
Above all you become a very very loving person.

198
00:31:04,603 --> 00:31:08,525
You have faith in your own love

199
00:31:11,716 --> 00:31:14,828
and you see that your love  succeeds

200
00:31:20,107 --> 00:31:23,166
and you are amazed how it works.

201
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:29,157
Now the time has come

202
00:31:29,205 --> 00:31:32,347
what you call as a last judgment.

203
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:40,858
 Now if you get to the right religion,

204
00:31:40,922 --> 00:31:45,735
 if you get to the right understanding of yourself,

205
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:52,597
so you should know you have decided for the highest ascent.

206
00:32:06,543 --> 00:32:11,376
This you will experience yourself

207
00:32:15,376 --> 00:32:20,226
 that you have become extremely loving,

208
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,794
 kind, forgiving person.

209
00:32:30,635 --> 00:32:36,066
 But by doing that you don't become,
don't become weak,

210
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:38,217
but  you become very strong.

211
00:32:44,427 --> 00:32:47,795
You didn't  see despite all of position

212
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:53,096
 how your Sufis have  stayed

213
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:55,801
that's    on their path of truth.

214
00:33:05,813 --> 00:33:10,458
But now you are not alone, you are not alone.

215
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:17,710
 You have thousands of them all over the world.

216
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:25,368
They are your brothers and sisters all over.

217
00:33:29,793 --> 00:33:33,406
You will be amazed how they look after you.

218
00:33:36,705 --> 00:33:38,903
How they are bothered about you,

219
00:33:42,345 --> 00:33:48,440
when you become one with the all pervading akbar,

220
00:33:48,465 --> 00:33:50,845
 then who is the other?

221
00:33:58,344 --> 00:34:04,458
For example, anything happens to
 this finger the whole body reacts.

222
00:34:10,207 --> 00:34:15,859
 In the same way all the Sahaja yogis,
 all the people all over the world,

223
00:34:15,884 --> 00:34:19,688
 who know themselves, will react  together

224
00:34:27,796 --> 00:34:32,996
 and their good wishes will act
 through the Divine Power.

225
00:34:40,821 --> 00:34:45,469
Gradually all this destructive nature

226
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:51,635
 and also the falsehood of people drops out.

227
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:05,953
Also you develop another

228
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,972
dimension in your awareness

229
00:35:15,284 --> 00:35:20,866
which is called as collective consciousness.

230
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:30,056
 So what you do, you can  feel
another person on your  fingertips.

231
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:37,527
 You can feel yourself also on your fingertips.

232
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:43,931
That is what Mohamed Sahab has said,

233
00:35:43,995 --> 00:35:47,338
 that at the time of Resurrection Kıyama

234
00:35:47,385 --> 00:35:49,367
 your hands will speak

235
00:35:49,392 --> 00:35:53,640
 and will give şahadet  (witness) against you.

236
00:36:09,017 --> 00:36:12,119
They will tell you what is wrong with you,

237
00:36:15,252 --> 00:36:20,077
your fingers will tell you what is wrong
with you, with your body,

238
00:36:20,102 --> 00:36:24,045
with your mind, everything you can know on your fingertips.

239
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:36,020
Now if you know how to correct

240
00:36:36,285 --> 00:36:42,305
 those defects in you, you can correct anybody’s problems,

241
00:36:50,936 --> 00:36:55,736
 because you can also feel
what is wrong with them on your fingertips.

242
00:37:02,288 --> 00:37:06,075
Sitting down here you can feel for anybody in Ankara

243
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,597
 or maybe London or anywhere

244
00:37:14,513 --> 00:37:19,206
and if you know how to correct sitting down here,
 you can correct that person.

245
00:37:26,903 --> 00:37:30,855
So, in short, is the  scientific language we will  say

246
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,368
that you enter into the subtler side, the

247
00:37:34,393 --> 00:37:37,989
the subtle of subtlest of Ether.

248
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:53,735
As your chakras get enlightened,
you enter into the subtler side

249
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,034
 of all the five elements.

250
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:14,493
Ultimately the sixth center, 
as they call it Agnya chakra,

251
00:38:14,518 --> 00:38:18,473
is once it is  enlightened,

252
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:22,306
 then you become extremely forgiving.

253
00:38:32,865 --> 00:38:35,325
You do not react,

254
00:38:37,793 --> 00:38:40,536
you watch everything like a witness.

255
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:47,941
Certainly now I see this carpet is very well made,

256
00:38:47,973 --> 00:38:50,610
 so normally I should  react.

257
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,828
How much it was have cost from
 where did you that buy

258
00:38:59,854 --> 00:39:02,753
who has made it, all these questions will come.

259
00:39:10,102 --> 00:39:13,186
But after the Self Realization

260
00:39:13,198 --> 00:39:16,246
you just watch and enjoy

261
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:20,377
the creativity of the artist who has made this.

262
00:39:31,211 --> 00:39:34,560
Your quarreling nature also subsides,

263
00:39:40,598 --> 00:39:43,180
because you do not react.

264
00:39:47,193 --> 00:39:52,946
To the last of is  this limbic  area where Kundalini arise

265
00:39:52,989 --> 00:39:59,213
 by which you get your peace and joy.

266
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:16,853
 Now Joy is a singular thing,

267
00:40:22,141 --> 00:40:25,053
 it is not happiness and unhappiness.

268
00:40:28,584 --> 00:40:30,695
 It is just  joy

269
00:40:32,507 --> 00:40:35,935
 that means you rises  above your thoughts,

270
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:41,529
above your mind and you are in complete peace.

271
00:40:48,122 --> 00:40:55,786
For example if you are standing

272
00:40:55,848 --> 00:40:59,881
 in the water and the waves are there,
 you are  afraid of it.

273
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:07,992
But in case,

274
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:12,121
in case , you get into a water,

275
00:41:12,171 --> 00:41:18,414
 then you can watch, you can watch  the waves

276
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:20,813
and enjoy them.

277
00:41:29,844 --> 00:41:33,765
But supposing you know swimming ,

278
00:41:33,805 --> 00:41:37,201
you can jump and save many others.

279
00:41:44,866 --> 00:41:50,269
So now Sahaja yoga is  working
  in eighty countries  in the whole world.

280
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:58,072
and in a very big way.

281
00:42:00,698 --> 00:42:03,585
Some people who got their self realisation

282
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:06,874
went around and give realization at to others.

283
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:14,042
For that you do not have to pay

284
00:42:16,718 --> 00:42:19,879
It's a natural process, living process

285
00:42:19,981 --> 00:42:22,346
How much would you pay for that?

286
00:42:29,275 --> 00:42:32,792
So it was without any payment,

287
00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:41,322
that's how the falsehood can be exposed

288
00:42:45,925 --> 00:42:48,686
because you pay for all kinds of falsehood.

289
00:42:52,582 --> 00:42:55,692
Now you can say who has pay for this all.

290
00:42:55,717 --> 00:42:58,790
 I must  say  the Sahaja yogis have paid.

291
00:43:06,618 --> 00:43:09,643
Formally I used to pay,

292
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:15,004
because I have money from my  family

293
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:16,471
also from my husband.

294
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,357
Now they want to pay.

295
00:43:24,009 --> 00:43:26,893
 They  think  for our self realization ,

296
00:43:26,918 --> 00:43:30,536
you are taking this hall, Mother why you should pay?

297
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:45,797
They can pay for the hall but not for  self realisation.

298
00:43:53,496 --> 00:43:57,268
Then the last center is broken,the seventh One

299
00:43:57,301 --> 00:44:01,413
 by which we get connected with this all pervading power.

300
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:16,862
Which we have not felt so far.
the presence of this all pervading power.

301
00:44:23,108 --> 00:44:31,674
But after self realization you feel it,
this cool breeze, the Ruh (spirit).

302
00:44:39,028 --> 00:44:43,315
In the beginning if very hot,

303
00:44:47,252 --> 00:44:50,867
 for that you have to forgive everyone,

304
00:44:51,714 --> 00:44:54,832
not to have anger for anyone.

305
00:45:01,106 --> 00:45:03,470
and it works very easily.

306
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,413
I know there are people here
 who want to ask me questions also.

307
00:45:15,936 --> 00:45:20,144
Just now make your questioning mind quite.

308
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,372
First get your self realisation

309
00:45:30,218 --> 00:45:32,630
 and then you can ask.

310
00:45:35,088 --> 00:45:40,306
You have to feel this cool breeze on your fingertips.

311
00:45:45,638 --> 00:45:48,399
So have faith in yourself.

312
00:45:50,345 --> 00:45:53,063
And you all  can feel this ruh (spirit).

313
00:45:55,734 --> 00:45:58,338
I assure you ,you can.

314
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:07,527
[UNCLEAR] hardly five to ten minutes.

315
00:46:11,254 --> 00:46:13,208
 I will work it out.

316
00:46:16,271 --> 00:46:20,136
I will request who want to go away ,can go away,

317
00:46:20,152 --> 00:46:22,098
don't disturb others.

318
00:46:28,861 --> 00:46:31,003
 I can not force  it only.

319
00:46:34,313 --> 00:46:36,019
You have to ask for it.

320
00:46:40,711 --> 00:46:45,516
If you want to have it,  you can get.

321
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:52,243
You must have the desire to have it ,

322
00:46:57,457 --> 00:46:59,790
 because is pure desire that works.

323
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:10,054
There is no competition, 
no trouble, nothing at all.

324
00:47:17,723 --> 00:47:22,412
Only thing you have to take out your shoes.

325
00:47:26,985 --> 00:47:30,257
 Because this Mother Earth is very pure

326
00:47:33,759 --> 00:47:35,761
 and she is very helpful.

327
00:47:43,354 --> 00:47:47,068
Can you  wait, Can you wait for a while?

328
00:47:50,491 --> 00:47:52,189
You can do it little later.

329
00:47:55,434 --> 00:47:57,600
Don't disturb this attention

330
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:02,706
for a while.

331
00:48:19,409 --> 00:48:24,020
I am not going to tell you to do anything whatsoever

332
00:48:24,051 --> 00:48:27,665
I will not even say do not think but automatically

333
00:48:27,722 --> 00:48:30,817
you will  go beyond your mind

334
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:42,615
and see then said this torsion area.

335
00:48:42,658 --> 00:48:45,483
 is called it torsion area.

336
00:48:58,063 --> 00:49:04,977
Alright, Now we have to do like this,
like we do for namaz that's all.

337
00:49:10,237 --> 00:49:11,814
Be comfortable.

338
00:49:13,346 --> 00:49:17,450
Take off your shoes and put both
the  feet away to  each other.

339
00:49:27,782 --> 00:49:35,530
Now  put your right hand on your heart

340
00:49:42,975 --> 00:49:47,883
and ask for forgiveness from God almighty

341
00:49:47,908 --> 00:49:52,259
if we have done anything wrong ,
 just to  ask forgive from heart.

342
00:50:00,614 --> 00:50:02,971
But don't  feel guilty.

343
00:50:05,675 --> 00:50:07,603
Mistake can be done

344
00:50:07,628 --> 00:50:10,049
and  now you ask for forgivness,

345
00:50:10,057 --> 00:50:12,995
so do not feel guilty at all

346
00:50:16,936 --> 00:50:25,283
If you feel guilty then this center
on the left hand gets bothered.

347
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:34,456
And who it is just like 
and we are not then coming.

348
00:50:48,562 --> 00:50:54,581
Now please put your right hand  towards me

349
00:50:54,679 --> 00:50:58,619
 and put down your head
and see for yourself

350
00:50:58,643 --> 00:51:04,163
is there  any cool or hot breeze 
 coming out  your head.

351
00:51:26,195 --> 00:51:32,126
Now If  it is hot then you have to forgive,
forgive everyone.

352
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,766
Now please down put 
your left hand towards me,

353
00:51:41,814 --> 00:51:44,579
 put down your head
and see for yourself

354
00:51:44,604 --> 00:51:50,001
if  there is a cool or  hot  breeze 
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

355
00:52:04,513 --> 00:52:08,685
Now please put both 
your hands towards me.

fontanel area. Just see it.

358
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,875
This is the ruh.

359
00:52:42,218 --> 00:52:49,763
You can ask a question in your heart ,
is this the ruh  the Divine power?

360
00:52:56,943 --> 00:53:02,944

There is something special.

373
00:54:22,088 --> 00:54:25,184
With the  Europeans  have to break my hands

374
00:54:28,797 --> 00:54:30,186
