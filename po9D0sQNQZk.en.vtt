00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:00.417
Diwali Puja, Los Angeles, USA November 18, 2001

00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:04.166
It’s a very, very great day today, I should say,

00:00:06.041 --> 00:00:12.250
where the evil has been suppressed.

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:52.083
The evil that spreads its power all over

00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:57.333
is only because of two factors.

00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:05.166
One is that you are not knowledgeable,

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:10.083
you are still blind,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.375
and you follow things

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:19.125
which are not right but you think are powerful.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.041
This illusion creates not only problems,

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:34.375
but absolute destruction.

00:01:37.417 --> 00:01:41.291
So we faced a very big challenge, no doubt

00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:50.166
and it was easily solved.

00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:58.125
It was based on all wrong basis,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.166
just to create a problem.

00:02:05.041 --> 00:02:10.333
Problem was created with a purpose,

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:19.208
and nobody could imagine

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:25.417
that it would be solved so easily and so quickly.

00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:33.375
My desire was to get over it before Diwali that has happened.

00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:59.041
Due to ignorance also, people do lots of things.

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:04.166
Anybody who follows some religion or some sort of a thing,

00:03:05.125 --> 00:03:10.166
it’s only because they’re not aware of the truth,

00:03:11.083 --> 00:03:15.166
they’re ignorant about achieving the truth,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.166
and they cling on to the fact

00:03:21.125 --> 00:03:24.041
that they know everything.

00:03:24.417 --> 00:03:27.250
With all this happening,

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:31.000
there have been so many fractions,

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.375
so many stupid people

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:42.041
who are getting completely ruined by ignorance.

00:03:44.417 --> 00:03:47.166
Now that we’re coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.041
you know all the knowledge – very subtle knowledge,

00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:59.333
very subtle. It’s not superficial knowledge,

00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:02.208
it is very subtle.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.417
And because they don’t know this subtle knowledge,

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:11.333
they fall into the wrong path of,

00:04:12.208 --> 00:04:17.166
I should say, ignorance and then they try to oppose

00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:20.000
the people who are doing good.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.041
But above all is the power of God.

00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:33.083
All this drama is played to prove the existence

00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:35.250
of that great Power.

00:04:36.417 --> 00:04:39.291
It has all worked out so well,

00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:42.375
and for all of you Sahaja yogis

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.000
it’s a very great achievement that you can see the play.

00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:52.333
Many people who have achieved

00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:55.333
so-called success cannot see that point,

00:04:56.375 --> 00:05:01.041
but you can see it because you are spectators.

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:08.000
Though all the world is a part and parcel of that drama,

00:05:08.417 --> 00:05:11.333
you are outside and you can see it so clearly.

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:16.458
Whatever has happened, nobody could have believed

00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:19.458
that would finish before Diwali.

00:05:21.125 --> 00:05:24.125
So it goes like this, the stupidity

00:05:25.125 --> 00:05:27.208
which is being created;

00:05:28.041 --> 00:05:31.500
and we also sometimes think that this kind of stupid thing

00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:36.417
will impress others. Impression is not the point.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.041
If you see among all these people who have lost,

00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:47.166
what impression have they created?

00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:51.208
They were there to create a great impression on everyone,

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:57.083
to show as if they were great warriors and fighters.

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:01.500
But what impression they have created?

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.208
Whether you are a realized soul or not,

00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:11.083
they can see that it’s a miracle,

00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:15.333
it’s a miracle how things have worked out.

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:26.166
Now the new phase has started.

00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:35.166
You all have a very, very open challenge

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:39.375
to get people into enlightenment.

00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:44.458
People are not so ignorant now,

00:06:45.166 --> 00:06:47.333
they are not so much blasted.

00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:52.166
Moreover, I find them very much changed.

00:06:52.542 --> 00:06:59.041
Their attitude towards truth has changed,

00:06:59.458 --> 00:07:01.333
and they understand

00:07:02.041 --> 00:07:05.333
there is truth beyond all this that they have known.

00:07:06.417 --> 00:07:08.208
It’s very important,

00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:15.041
because if a human being starts thinking

00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:18.250
“this is the truth,” he just gets stuck up.

00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:22.125
At any cost, whatever may happen,

00:07:23.041 --> 00:07:25.458
he’ll go on sticking to that.

00:07:27.208 --> 00:07:32.083
He won’t be able even to verify whether it is the truth or not.

00:07:33.166 --> 00:07:38.417
Animals can. How? Because they have got innate capacity

00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:44.417
to smell the evil – innate.

00:07:46.208 --> 00:07:48.458
We cannot, human beings cannot.

00:07:49.375 --> 00:07:52.500
If there’s a evil man, a dog will bark at him.

00:07:54.291 --> 00:08:00.166
Otherwise he’ll go and throw him down.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.250
He’ll do everything which is not normally done.

00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:12.458
How is it he has developed this capacity to find out

00:08:13.333 --> 00:08:16.166
who is a thief and who is not?

00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:20.458
We have a higher awareness.

00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:26.041
We think about many things which animals cannot think.

00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:32.375
We understand many things which animals cannot understand.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.291
We cook our food – they don’t.

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:42.166
But also I sometimes, I think we cook our brains,

00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:48.083
because the way people behave

00:08:49.375 --> 00:08:55.000
and try to avoid the truth with their ego is surprising.

00:08:56.542 --> 00:08:58.417
All this happening

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.333
is a drama, as I told you, but you better study it  properly

00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:05.542
and apply it to yourself, and see

00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:09.375
if you are also a part and parcel of that drama.

00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:14.458
For that, you have to rise higher.

00:09:16.333 --> 00:09:18.166
You have to rise higher

00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:25.083
– higher above your ego and your superego, your conditioning,

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:30.417
and from there to watch yourself and see yourself:

00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:36.041
“What is this? Why am I doing such a thing?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.166
Why my attention is like that?

00:09:39.458 --> 00:09:42.083
What is the main reason

00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:48.083
for my own

00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:53.208
possession, I should say, or my own

00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:59.417
misunderstandings? Why do I accept wrong things?”

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.250
Once you’ll start seeing that,

00:10:04.458 --> 00:10:07.458
and if you find even a wee bit of such

00:10:08.166 --> 00:10:11.000
nonsensical understanding within you,

00:10:11.417 --> 00:10:14.083
then you can forgive also people

00:10:14.333 --> 00:10:18.125
who have been absolutely brainwashed,

00:10:19.375 --> 00:10:21.542
absolutely brainwashed,

00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:26.417
and they did everything under that influence.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.333
As it is now you have risen much higher

00:10:34.375 --> 00:10:37.041
than all these people,

00:10:38.458 --> 00:10:44.125
and much more aware than all of them.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:50.041
So you have to just understand this point,

00:10:50.417 --> 00:10:55.041
and then you can forgive all the mistakes they have committed.

00:10:58.208 --> 00:11:04.166
And for the people who are actually bad,

00:11:05.458 --> 00:11:07.458
you don’t have to worry.

00:11:08.458 --> 00:11:13.250
That’s the work of the divine Power to destroy them.

00:11:16.041 --> 00:11:19.250
But watch yourself and see for yourself

00:11:20.208 --> 00:11:26.458
if you have any of such ideas, any lingering idea.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.375
You should try to cleanse the mirror

00:11:34.041 --> 00:11:39.291
so you see your complete image

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.125
and try, you can then try to cleanse it.

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:54.208
It’s very important that you should cleanse yourself.

00:12:00.458 --> 00:12:06.333
There are people who have done lots of wrong things.

00:12:07.417 --> 00:12:10.000
I simply pity them.

00:12:11.041 --> 00:12:15.542
If they have done wrong things, it is their responsibility

00:12:16.166 --> 00:12:18.166
to see what they have been doing.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.333
Why have they been doing like that?

00:12:22.291 --> 00:12:24.375
What is the need to do that?

00:12:28.208 --> 00:12:33.542
All this introspection will work out so well.

00:12:35.041 --> 00:12:37.291
Then your real powers will come out

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:45.250
– your powers of giving realization,

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:54.166
your powers to understand the problems of your country,

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:59.333
of the whole world.

00:13:00.166 --> 00:13:05.542
And once you feel that you are the soldier to fight it out,

00:13:06.375 --> 00:13:09.208
you have the responsibility to fight it out,

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:12.375
then things will work out.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.333
We cannot leave everything to the divine Power.

00:13:20.041 --> 00:13:25.583
You have to use the divine Power, and you have to work it out

00:13:26.083 --> 00:13:30.041
because you are the soldiers of divine Power.

00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:39.417
Of course, with that beautiful idea

00:13:40.542 --> 00:13:47.166
we start cleansing ourselves. You need not know everything

00:13:48.333 --> 00:13:51.667
as to what things are happening and how they are happening,

00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:55.667
how they are working out. That’s not your work.

00:13:56.709 --> 00:14:01.166
You are a soldier so you have to just fight,

00:14:01.709 --> 00:14:06.125
fight the ignorance – your own and of others.

00:14:07.375 --> 00:14:12.125
Because mostly soldiers fail when they have their egos.

00:14:14.041 --> 00:14:20.709
When they fail, they have other obstacles in their minds.

00:14:21.458 --> 00:14:27.542
There should be no obstacle, but you should just  push forward

00:14:29.208 --> 00:14:32.041
and know there’s no obstacle at all.

00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:36.625
It’s just a myth that there are some obstacles

00:14:37.208 --> 00:14:39.166
and that you cannot do it.

00:14:42.709 --> 00:14:47.333
It’s not easy to raise the awareness of people,

00:14:48.333 --> 00:14:53.250
because looks there’s a very little distance

00:14:53.625 --> 00:14:59.166
of crossing over, but it’s not so – it’s not.

00:14:59.417 --> 00:15:02.583
It is a very difficult task sometimes

00:15:03.333 --> 00:15:11.208
for some people to get out of the bandhans of Agnya.

00:15:12.709 --> 00:15:16.667
At that point I find some of you fail.

00:15:18.333 --> 00:15:22.208
And for that, best thing is to introspect.

00:15:23.583 --> 00:15:27.083
When you think you are always correct and you are all right,

00:15:27.542 --> 00:15:31.333
it’s best is to introspect,

00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:35.709
“Am I doing everything right?

00:15:37.208 --> 00:15:42.542
How am I working for my betterment?”

00:15:44.166 --> 00:15:46.291
The illusion is such

00:15:47.041 --> 00:15:49.250
that sometimes you think you are doing very well.

00:15:49.542 --> 00:15:53.375
Say, in our Sahaja Yoga some people are very forward type;

00:15:53.542 --> 00:15:56.125
they’ll come forward, they’ll do this, do that.

00:15:57.375 --> 00:16:03.125
But inside, what is the purpose?  The purpose is that

00:16:03.375 --> 00:16:06.208
people should see that you are doing this work, that work.

00:16:09.333 --> 00:16:10.500
The purpose should be

00:16:10.667 --> 00:16:13.417
that you should be able to see yourself within.

00:16:14.583 --> 00:16:19.166
You must see what is the problem inside,

00:16:22.417 --> 00:16:25.709
and you can very well understand

00:16:27.166 --> 00:16:33.000
that you have been of great help to yourself and to others.

00:16:34.709 --> 00:16:41.041
For example, there’s a very big building,

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.083
and all the buildings in the nearby area

00:16:48.417 --> 00:16:53.375
may fall down due to earthquake, but this one building

00:16:54.333 --> 00:17:00.333
which will be standing erect. The reason is that that building

00:17:01.083 --> 00:17:04.667
is constructed on very solid grounds.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.208
In the same way

00:17:07.375 --> 00:17:10.583
if Sahaja Yoga is constructed on a very sound wall,

00:17:11.542 --> 00:17:16.458
nobody can destroy it, nobody can distort it;

00:17:17.375 --> 00:17:20.417
and every person has to do that.

00:17:21.625 --> 00:17:23.625
For example, some people told Me,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.417
“Your Sahaja yogis, you know, are like this, and that

00:17:26.709 --> 00:17:29.166
they are big show-offs and that.”

00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:34.458
I said, “Really? I can’t believe it

00:17:35.583 --> 00:17:38.667
that they could be like that.

00:17:39.583 --> 00:17:43.333
” I said, “I would like to meet them, whosoever they are.”

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:56.667
So they said, “No, You can find them out Yourself

00:17:57.333 --> 00:18:01.709
who are those people and why they behave like that.”

00:18:03.125 --> 00:18:06.583
I said, “Myself I know everything,

00:18:08.375 --> 00:18:11.166
but I want you to know everything.”

00:18:12.709 --> 00:18:17.709
Finding faults with others is a very nice thing, very easy also

00:18:18.458 --> 00:18:21.417
– but find out faults within yourself.

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.083
What are these things that are strangling us?

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:36.709
This is the best way of improving your awareness.

00:18:37.709 --> 00:18:45.166
Like you are going in the car and you have to know the road,

00:18:47.083 --> 00:18:50.125
you have to know how you are driving,

00:18:50.583 --> 00:18:53.291
you have to see what are the problems.

00:18:54.417 --> 00:18:57.458
But instead of you think, oh, no end of yourself

00:18:58.542 --> 00:19:00.542
– it won’t work out.

00:19:02.166 --> 00:19:07.375
Today is a day of very great happening, I should say.

00:19:07.709 --> 00:19:12.333
Celebrating the Diwali is a very, very

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.583
joyous thing.

00:19:19.583 --> 00:19:26.166
But this joy is not for ourselves;

00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:29.125
this joy is for the whole world.

00:19:30.041 --> 00:19:32.709
We have to work for the whole world.

00:19:33.417 --> 00:19:38.667
We work for ourselves, for our jobs, for our money, whatever it is,

00:19:39.583 --> 00:19:44.041
but what are you doing for others?

00:19:45.291 --> 00:19:48.125
That you should see for yourself,

00:19:48.667 --> 00:19:55.458
that’s very important. Only such people are useful in Sahaja Yoga

00:19:57.208 --> 00:20:01.542
because they have concern, they have care,

00:20:02.041 --> 00:20:04.500
and they are doing something for others.

00:20:06.208 --> 00:20:11.000
It’s a great enjoyment with that, when the lights are burning,

00:20:13.041 --> 00:20:17.375
it’s to give you happiness; they are burning their bodies

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:23.125
to give you happiness. They are the ones who should teach us

00:20:23.417 --> 00:20:26.333
that we have to do something ourselves

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:31.500
to enjoy our own higher awareness.

00:20:34.041 --> 00:20:40.625
All this will work out, I am sure. I am also trying My best

00:20:42.458 --> 00:20:48.417
to make this light unshaky

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:55.000
and full of enthusiasm.

00:20:56.458 --> 00:21:02.166
It’s there. It is you who are

00:21:03.125 --> 00:21:07.583
anxious to fill your pitchers.

00:21:08.625 --> 00:21:11.250
You can do it.

00:21:13.125 --> 00:21:17.375
It’s not My anxiety that’s going to help you.

00:21:18.625 --> 00:21:22.417
So you’ll start, and even if you want to have

00:21:25.458 --> 00:21:28.166
complete picture about yourself,

00:21:29.583 --> 00:21:36.041
you have to first give up identification with yourself;

00:21:38.083 --> 00:21:41.709
otherwise you’ll never know what’s wrong with you.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.500
If you are too much identified with you, you cannot come up.

00:21:48.375 --> 00:21:52.667
Now as it is, what is the aim after all,

00:21:53.542 --> 00:21:56.667
what is the aim of our lives?

00:21:59.125 --> 00:22:05.667
We have to change the whole world into a peaceful theme.

00:22:09.458 --> 00:22:12.500
Changing yourself, of course, is great thing, no doubt;

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:19.625
but changing others also will stop all the problems of the world.

00:22:20.375 --> 00:22:24.417
If all the people of this world become good people, Sahaja yogis,

00:22:25.417 --> 00:22:28.000
then can you imagine what will happen?

00:22:28.417 --> 00:22:30.542
Think of that dream I have,

00:22:31.333 --> 00:22:38.166
that we have to change each and every person that we can change,

00:22:39.166 --> 00:22:43.208
and we have to transform them into good people.

00:22:44.625 --> 00:22:46.166
If they are not transformed

00:22:46.291 --> 00:22:48.709
they are like a candle without any flame in it.

00:22:49.458 --> 00:22:54.250
And if they are capable of getting transformed,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.709
we should try all methods, all the tricks to do that.

00:23:03.417 --> 00:23:07.375
I’m sure very soon such a day will come when you will say,

00:23:08.166 --> 00:23:10.542
“Mother, now we are very safe.”

00:23:14.375 --> 00:23:18.000
Don’t think of the past and the problems of the past

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:21.000
– you have now overcome it.

00:23:21.542 --> 00:23:26.083
Just enjoy yourself and have faith in yourself,

00:23:26.375 --> 00:23:33.000
and work it out. I am sure very soon it will happen,

00:23:33.417 --> 00:23:40.000
very quickly it will happen. It is your desire, also

00:23:43.709 --> 00:23:46.166
your method of working it out,

00:23:46.542 --> 00:23:48.709
your anxiety to work it out.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:53.417
Main anxiety should be, “How can I transform this person?”

00:23:56.667 --> 00:23:58.500
You can transform anyone.

00:23:59.542 --> 00:24:02.417
You know, you tell one person, another person follows it.

00:24:03.291 --> 00:24:05.375
Like when we came in the plane,

00:24:06.375 --> 00:24:09.250
I found at the airport so many people

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.083
had put up their hands towards Me like this.

00:24:12.417 --> 00:24:16.166
I said, “Who are these people?” They were not Sahaja yogis.

00:24:17.166 --> 00:24:22.041
They had seen somebody, or what had happened I couldn’t ask them,

00:24:23.041 --> 00:24:26.041
but all of them said, “We are feeling the cool breeze in the hand.

00:24:26.667 --> 00:24:28.583
” They didn’t know anything about it,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.208
they didn’t know about kundalini, nothing.

00:24:31.375 --> 00:24:33.375
Then what is this cool coming?

00:24:34.333 --> 00:24:39.166
That basically they are there to get their realization,

00:24:40.125 --> 00:24:43.083
only we have to extend our ideals,

00:24:43.333 --> 00:24:46.583
we have to extend our love to them.

00:24:48.583 --> 00:24:51.583
Instead of getting annoyed with them,

00:24:52.417 --> 00:24:55.208
better is to give them a chance

00:24:56.291 --> 00:25:02.375
and you’ll be amazed that they are very anxious to get transformed.

00:25:03.166 --> 00:25:07.709
They’re all fed up with all the artificial things they’re having.

00:25:09.041 --> 00:25:12.458
It’s over now. You will be amazed

00:25:12.667 --> 00:25:17.458
how many are waiting there for you to give them Self-realization

00:25:18.125 --> 00:25:23.417
and let them celebrate their Diwali with you, enjoy the Diwali.

00:25:27.542 --> 00:25:31.041
Diwali you cannot celebrate with one candle.

00:25:32.417 --> 00:25:35.417
You have to have more and more of candles,

00:25:36.166 --> 00:25:38.291
and that’s what is your job.

00:25:39.041 --> 00:25:42.542
Only by your own candle you are going to do it; it’s your own,

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:49.542
and it can enlighten anyone. Then why not use it,

00:25:51.417 --> 00:25:53.625
at any cost, at any place?

00:25:56.667 --> 00:26:00.375
I have met some Sahaja yogis.

00:26:02.375 --> 00:26:06.041
I asked them, “What did you do?”

00:26:06.667 --> 00:26:08.375
They said, “No, nothing.”

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:11.041
“Nothing? You did nothing?”

00:26:12.125 --> 00:26:13.250
“No, nothing.”

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.709
Then what’s the use of getting realization?

00:26:19.041 --> 00:26:20.625
If you have done nothing,

00:26:21.458 --> 00:26:24.208
you don’t want to give realization to anyone,

00:26:24.542 --> 00:26:28.667
don’t want to talk to anyone, you feel so shy about it?

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:34.083
Then I met some who said, “Just now, Mother,

00:26:35.166 --> 00:26:39.375
we are coming from a program.”

00:26:41.083 --> 00:26:42.583
“How are you so late?”

00:26:43.667 --> 00:26:47.291
“Because they told us there’s a bomb scare.”

00:26:47.709 --> 00:26:50.125
“So you were waiting outside?”

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:51.458
“Yes.” “How many?”

00:26:51.625 --> 00:26:55.166
“All of us.  Thousands were waiting.

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.291
There was no bomb, they said there’s no bomb.

00:26:58.583 --> 00:27:01.250
So we went inside and we all got realization.”

00:27:01.625 --> 00:27:03.625
“But you were realized souls?”

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.417
“No, we had our realization,

00:27:06.709 --> 00:27:09.458
that sometimes we have to wait too.

00:27:10.709 --> 00:27:14.125
And now we are convinced that nobody can harm us,

00:27:14.667 --> 00:27:18.208
nobody can trouble us, overpower us.

00:27:18.417 --> 00:27:20.542
Only we do it to ourselves.”

00:27:21.166 --> 00:27:24.000
So again I will say introspection

00:27:24.417 --> 00:27:27.417
is very, very important in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:28.125 --> 00:27:32.458
When the light inside is there, you have to look after it.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.458
I was extremely happy to hear from many people

00:27:41.583 --> 00:27:47.375
that they felt the blessings of Diwali.

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:53.500
But you see, yesterday you had these showers

00:27:54.208 --> 00:27:58.000
– how timely they were! It never happened,

00:27:58.625 --> 00:28:02.291
in the history of this world it never happened;

00:28:02.458 --> 00:28:07.458
why yesterday these showers came in and tried to

00:28:08.417 --> 00:28:12.208
give a new experience of the showers?

00:28:13.208 --> 00:28:16.417
All this is a time, we should say,

00:28:17.166 --> 00:28:24.000
that even the nature knows and we should also know,

00:28:24.709 --> 00:28:28.458
that this is the time for a special thing.

00:28:30.375 --> 00:28:32.500
Normally I get letters

00:28:33.375 --> 00:28:38.083
about people who are sick and their parents are sick or their ...

00:28:38.417 --> 00:28:40.375
this is sick, all kinds of things.

00:28:41.125 --> 00:28:43.458
Then somebody’s marriage is broken;

00:28:44.083 --> 00:28:47.500
then somebody has children, they are sick –

00:28:48.125 --> 00:28:52.542
??? all kinds of nonsensical problems, they do it.

00:28:54.375 --> 00:28:55.500
The reason is they

00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:58.125
themselves, those who write are not realized souls,

00:28:58.542 --> 00:29:01.375
or maybe they are halfway,

00:29:02.208 --> 00:29:04.166
because they could themself say

00:29:04.375 --> 00:29:06.250
that “Why should we write to Mother?

00:29:07.083 --> 00:29:09.417
We can get it done ourselves.”

00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:14.083
Instead of that, one has to write

00:29:14.583 --> 00:29:18.041
what they have achieved, how they have achieved very much,

00:29:18.375 --> 00:29:22.166
how they have got love from others,

00:29:23.083 --> 00:29:27.458
how they have worked out Sahaja Yoga in small villages.

00:29:28.458 --> 00:29:30.583
All this is much better to write,

00:29:31.166 --> 00:29:34.458
than to write, “My mother is sick, my father is sick.”

00:29:35.083 --> 00:29:40.375
All these relationships, they go on killing you.

00:29:41.417 --> 00:29:44.458
So no more is your brother, nobody is your sister;

00:29:46.166 --> 00:29:49.333
only Sahaja yogis are your brothers and sisters.

00:29:50.375 --> 00:29:54.166
Now you have some cousin and it’s cousin’s cousin and....

00:29:54.458 --> 00:29:58.458
So let it be. That’s not your job,

00:29:59.458 --> 00:30:01.458
you don’t have to work it out.

00:30:02.041 --> 00:30:05.458
Even before coming I got letters like that:

00:30:06.417 --> 00:30:09.291
somebody cousin’s cousin’s ... this thing.

00:30:10.125 --> 00:30:13.208
So I asked this lady, I said,

00:30:13.583 --> 00:30:16.291
“Why do you write all these things

00:30:16.709 --> 00:30:20.000
all the time about this cousin and that cousin?”

00:30:20.333 --> 00:30:23.083
She says, “Mother, I am trying to spread Sahaja Yoga.”

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:24.458
“How?”

00:30:24.667 --> 00:30:28.709
“Because if they’ll be cured, then they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga.”

00:30:29.542 --> 00:30:32.625
This is not the way we want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:33.542 --> 00:30:37.083
This looks like advertising or something,

00:30:37.333 --> 00:30:40.709
speciality that you should cure somebody,

00:30:41.166 --> 00:30:43.542
then some people will come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:44.208 --> 00:30:46.709
We just don’t want such people to come.

00:30:48.333 --> 00:30:52.500
I don’t want to hurt, but I want to give you courage

00:30:53.041 --> 00:30:56.166
and understanding, and the wisdom.

00:30:57.125 --> 00:30:59.417
What, why are we Sahaja yogis here

00:30:59.625 --> 00:31:03.583
– just to cure all the relations of ours?

00:31:05.041 --> 00:31:08.500
They may be sick because of some mistakes they have committed.

00:31:09.709 --> 00:31:13.083
Instead of paying attention to all these such people,

00:31:14.041 --> 00:31:19.583
you should pay attention to yourself and to your ascent.

00:31:20.166 --> 00:31:21.625
You have to respect yourself.

00:31:22.667 --> 00:31:26.041
If you are their relation, it’s none of your business.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.291
Like understanding,

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:38.709
wisdom that we have come here for a

00:31:39.208 --> 00:31:43.709
very,  very special work of very high quality:

00:31:45.333 --> 00:31:50.250
that is not there. Then all such people write to Me.

00:31:51.166 --> 00:31:54.083
Now one lady got married in Sahaja Yoga

00:31:55.583 --> 00:31:59.458
and she wrote to Me that “I was divorced

00:32:00.583 --> 00:32:03.500
about eight months back or nine months back, whatever it is.

00:32:04.625 --> 00:32:07.375
And all my relations are now saying,

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:10.458
‘Why did you marry in Sahaja Yoga?’

00:32:10.709 --> 00:32:14.250
And everybody is criticizing me and Sahaja Yoga.”

00:32:16.041 --> 00:32:20.458
I said, “Who asked her to marry?” I never asked her.

00:32:21.667 --> 00:32:25.000
So now the marriage has become the main point for her,

00:32:25.458 --> 00:32:28.375
that “all my family people are saying ...

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.667
” What did they do for Sahaja Yoga?

00:32:33.083 --> 00:32:35.333
If this marriage doesn’t become

00:32:35.625 --> 00:32:37.417
all right, then they will say there’s

00:32:37.583 --> 00:32:39.583
something wrong with Sahaja Yoga. Let them say.

00:32:42.625 --> 00:32:46.208
We have not committed that way.

00:32:48.667 --> 00:32:52.208
Every time I have told you that don’t write to Me for your mother,

00:32:52.375 --> 00:32:53.417
father, this, that.

00:32:55.208 --> 00:32:58.041
If you don’t know how to cure them, better give up Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:00.166 --> 00:33:02.458
You yourself can cure them

00:33:04.083 --> 00:33:06.333
you can work it out yourself.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:11.333
But you should see it, so many letters every day for Me.

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.166
I ask them, “Is your father in Sahaja Yoga?”

00:33:17.375 --> 00:33:18.375
“Mother?" " No.”

00:33:18.667 --> 00:33:21.000
“Brother?” “No, nobody.”

00:33:21.709 --> 00:33:27.000
So why are you asking Me?

00:33:27.667 --> 00:33:30.166
What relationship I have with them?

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.458
They’re not Sahaja yogis. I am only responsible for Sahaja yogis.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:39.417
They are not Sahaja yogis, so why do you want to trouble Me?

00:33:41.333 --> 00:33:44.041
It is impossible to understand.

00:33:45.709 --> 00:33:49.625
In Sahaja Yoga you are supposed to get Self-realization, all right.

00:33:50.709 --> 00:33:56.000
Then those who want to have Self-realization,

00:33:56.458 --> 00:34:00.125
you can give them and fix them properly.

00:34:00.667 --> 00:34:04.625
But instead of that somebody who is hanging in the air

00:34:05.291 --> 00:34:09.083
and who is falling from the airport to some other place,

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:10.625
all kinds of things

00:34:11.333 --> 00:34:16.208
– all this is really maddening, and is sickening.

00:34:17.208 --> 00:34:21.208
I’m not concerned; you should not be concerned also.

00:34:21.625 --> 00:34:24.083
What you should do is to see

00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:28.583
that these people who're talking about it should come to Sahaja Yoga

00:34:30.375 --> 00:34:31.500
And you must tell them,

00:34:31.667 --> 00:34:35.083
“Because you are not doing Sahaja Yoga, that’s why it is like that”

00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:39.041
or “That person is not doing Sahaja Yoga,

00:34:39.166 --> 00:34:42.166
that’s why this is the problem is. We are all right, we are happy"

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.250
Because Sahaja Yoga is an open thing,

00:34:48.583 --> 00:34:50.709
so everybody comes there.

00:34:52.125 --> 00:34:54.542
I would request you on a Diwali day

00:34:55.041 --> 00:34:59.500
to promise to yourself, “I will not waste my energy

00:35:00.041 --> 00:35:02.291
on people who are not Sahaja yogis.

00:35:06.166 --> 00:35:07.667
” It’s very important,

00:35:08.625 --> 00:35:11.709
because all the time the attention is on wrong things

00:35:14.667 --> 00:35:16.542
and on wrong basis.

00:35:17.709 --> 00:35:20.083
If you have some intelligence

00:35:20.417 --> 00:35:23.500
you must know that now you belong

00:35:24.458 --> 00:35:31.375
to a very high-quality spiritual people,

00:35:33.166 --> 00:35:37.583
which are very few. In this world

00:35:39.125 --> 00:35:44.458
they are very few, and you must make a concentrated effort

00:35:45.667 --> 00:35:51.625
to see that this quality

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.709
must be in so many people,

00:35:56.291 --> 00:35:59.709
and there must be lots of aspiration about it.

00:36:00.375 --> 00:36:03.583
Find out such people, tell them

00:36:04.208 --> 00:36:06.542
you have found it – “you can also get it.”

00:36:08.333 --> 00:36:11.583
But don’t worry about things

00:36:12.041 --> 00:36:14.667
which are of no value to us.

00:36:15.709 --> 00:36:18.083
You must know you are a special race.

00:36:19.333 --> 00:36:21.375
You are special soldiers

00:36:22.375 --> 00:36:27.458
who have been trained

00:36:29.166 --> 00:36:31.208
for doing Sahaj work only.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:36.417
So wasting energy on your relations

00:36:36.542 --> 00:36:40.583
and brothers and sisters is no good for you.

00:36:44.291 --> 00:36:46.417
It is to be understood now

00:36:48.083 --> 00:36:52.625
that you have your own energy reserved

00:36:54.291 --> 00:36:58.333
– for what? For Sahaja yogis only.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.041
You should help everyone

00:37:06.417 --> 00:37:09.208
who is a Sahaja yogi

00:37:09.375 --> 00:37:11.709
or who wants to become a Sahaja yogi.

00:37:13.542 --> 00:37:16.208
Who are established Sahaja yogis,

00:37:16.709 --> 00:37:20.667
you must help them; because we are one Personality

00:37:22.375 --> 00:37:25.375
and these are all the different hands

00:37:26.709 --> 00:37:30.166
of one Personality, one God.

00:37:32.333 --> 00:37:36.250
So this oneness must be established

00:37:37.208 --> 00:37:43.625
within yourself, and also others should see that oneness in you.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:49.166
There are some people who are very active.

00:37:50.208 --> 00:37:55.125
There are some people who are very active in criticizing.

00:38:00.417 --> 00:38:03.083
All that will work out, I’m sure,

00:38:03.375 --> 00:38:09.291
because this is the year of great achievements and great success;

00:38:10.291 --> 00:38:14.417
but with that if you start doing something nonsensical,

00:38:15.208 --> 00:38:17.291
nothing will work out.

00:38:21.709 --> 00:38:25.375
Of course, I don’t say that we haven’t got such Sahaja yogis

00:38:25.542 --> 00:38:30.291
with us – we have. We have all the soldiers with us, no doubt.

00:38:31.041 --> 00:38:34.667
All the armament they have, everything they have;

00:38:35.417 --> 00:38:37.250
but we need more.

00:38:38.667 --> 00:38:42.667
And for that we have to work out collectively,

00:38:43.667 --> 00:38:46.333
must plan what should we do.

00:38:48.333 --> 00:38:51.500
Recently there has been a big

00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:57.291
argument about the Islamic behavior of people.

00:38:58.417 --> 00:39:02.125
We are neither Christians nor Islamic nor anything.

00:39:03.667 --> 00:39:11.166
We are not; because you cannot put yourself into a small

00:39:12.125 --> 00:39:15.709
arena, saying, “I am a Sahaja yogi, but I am a Christian.”

00:39:16.583 --> 00:39:20.667
You cannot.  You haveto give up that margin.

00:39:21.458 --> 00:39:24.125
You are a Sahaja yogi out and out,

00:39:24.667 --> 00:39:28.709
and all the other nonsensical things are not belonging to you.

00:39:31.375 --> 00:39:34.417
I have seen many Muslims also come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.250
but out of them very few are real Sahaja yogis.

00:39:40.375 --> 00:39:43.458
But they’ll come, listen to My lecture, this, that.

00:39:44.208 --> 00:39:50.542
But very few are really Sahaja yogis in the real sense of the word.

00:39:52.208 --> 00:39:56.625
Then you will start seeing the defects of your community

00:39:57.375 --> 00:40:02.625
of so-called religion you belong to, whatever it is you will see.

00:40:03.291 --> 00:40:08.625
And you will definitely try to correct it,

00:40:09.166 --> 00:40:10.667
if you love them

00:40:12.083 --> 00:40:14.250
– or you give up.

00:40:15.709 --> 00:40:19.667
These are special people, specially selected

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.500
for a very special cause,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.125
and you cannot waste your energy on small, nonsensical things.

00:40:27.709 --> 00:40:30.291
That is one thing you should know.

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.542
On this Diwali day you have to know

00:40:34.291 --> 00:40:37.208
that you have to burn yourself

00:40:38.083 --> 00:40:44.542
for the light of the Divine to absolutely spread all over.

00:40:47.375 --> 00:40:49.667
But don’t do it too much.

00:40:50.125 --> 00:40:52.333
Like some people came and told Me,

00:40:52.667 --> 00:40:55.291
“Mother, we have given up our parents,

00:40:55.417 --> 00:40:57.625
we have given up this,  we have given up that.

00:40:58.291 --> 00:41:00.291
Still we are not good.”

00:41:00.709 --> 00:41:03.375
So I said, “Why should you give up?

00:41:04.166 --> 00:41:07.375
You are catching onto something, then you are giving up?

00:41:08.083 --> 00:41:11.041
Or automatically it’s just finished?”

00:41:11.458 --> 00:41:16.500
“Ah, we were, you see, very much attached to our family, parents,

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:22.375
country, this, that, and now we have given up some – but some.”

00:41:24.041 --> 00:41:27.000
Such half-baked people are no good,

00:41:28.375 --> 00:41:31.125
and don’t pay too much attention to them.

00:41:32.166 --> 00:41:34.375
They don’t deserve any attention.

00:41:35.709 --> 00:41:40.208
That is very much to be understood,

00:41:41.083 --> 00:41:43.208
that you should not be also like that,

00:41:43.709 --> 00:41:46.417
nor you should have friends like that,.

00:41:46.583 --> 00:41:49.625
nor you should make them Sahaja yogis

00:41:50.458 --> 00:41:54.125
Sahaja yogi is a special character

00:41:54.333 --> 00:41:58.083
of a soldier who fights for the truth.

00:42:00.583 --> 00:42:06.583
That kind of a personality when you will have,

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.250
there will be lights all over.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:19.250
This Diwali day I bless you all from My heart,

00:42:21.125 --> 00:42:24.125
and I want you to respect yourself

00:42:25.166 --> 00:42:29.125
and understand what is the position of

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.041
your being in this

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:40.542
organization,  we can call, or in this movement of Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:42.709 --> 00:42:45.458
And how are we working it out?

00:42:46.208 --> 00:42:48.250
The attention should move from

00:42:48.542 --> 00:42:52.458
all this nonsensical, mundane things to yourself.

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:58.083
It should be a very dynamic force that should work out.

00:43:00.709 --> 00:43:04.208
And I’m sure next year it would be very different.

00:43:05.417 --> 00:43:11.250
We’ll have all the beautiful blessings of the Divine.

00:43:13.208 --> 00:43:16.166
We must do it collectively, understandingly.

00:43:16.709 --> 00:43:18.333
May God bless you.
