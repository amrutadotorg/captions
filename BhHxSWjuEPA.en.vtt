Shri Mataji's speech and subtitles start at 21:56

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.178
Devi Puja, Patricia Deene’s House Gent (Belgium) 22-9-1982

00:21:56.248 --> 00:22:00.181
This is the first time we are having a puja in Belgium.

00:22:00.515 --> 00:22:05.682
That’s very quick for a puja to be done like that.

00:22:05.914 --> 00:22:10.381
Normally we don’t allow people to come to puja

00:22:10.481 --> 00:22:14.181
unless and until they are established Sahaja yogis.

00:22:14.682 --> 00:22:21.448
Because sometimes if they are half-baked, it harms them more

00:22:21.847 --> 00:22:28.615
in the way that they start doubting and thinking about it.

00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:31.648
But in the puja you should stop thinking,

00:22:32.214 --> 00:22:34.415
do not doubt, do not think,

00:22:34.881 --> 00:22:37.615
then you have the best advantage out of it.

00:22:37.947 --> 00:22:41.881
As far as I’m concerned,

00:22:42.782 --> 00:22:48.682
my chakras start working sometimes with a great force.

00:22:48.914 --> 00:22:51.581
Say if Gavin does puja, he is such a great Sahaja yogi

00:22:51.648 --> 00:22:57.114
that the deities can start emitting lots of vibrations.

00:22:57.648 --> 00:23:00.114
But if you are not in the receiving mood,

00:23:00.314 --> 00:23:03.814
then it takes time for me to take out the vibrations

00:23:04.114 --> 00:23:08.981
in the atmosphere or in another awareness.

00:23:09.348 --> 00:23:14.715
So it becomes more difficult for me to have a puja, because sometimes

00:23:15.048 --> 00:23:20.981
I do suffer with overflowing vibrations which you cannot suck in.

00:23:21.515 --> 00:23:27.348
So today as we have ventured to have this puja for all of you,

00:23:27.881 --> 00:23:33.314
please try to receive, humble down yourselves in your hearts.

00:23:33.448 --> 00:23:40.148
Only through your hearts you can receive the blessings of this puja.

00:23:40.814 --> 00:23:47.314
It's a very higher state when you can do that,

00:23:47.914 --> 00:23:55.481
but it's alright with Sahaja yoga, they are aware, all the deities

00:23:55.648 --> 00:24:00.281
that you are still children, you can make mistakes

00:24:00.715 --> 00:24:05.947
and you are seekers and you are especially blessed by me.

00:24:06.515 --> 00:24:09.715
It's not difficult in India because the one who raises the kundalini

00:24:09.881 --> 00:24:14.682
like this of masses of people definitely establishes me

00:24:14.847 --> 00:24:17.847
in their hearts, that I’m the primordial Mother.

00:24:17.981 --> 00:24:21.648
Because it's written in so many books so they don’t have this problem.

00:24:21.947 --> 00:24:24.881
While here people have not heard about Holy Ghost and

00:24:25.114 --> 00:24:27.682
it’s a secret for them and they just can’t understand.

00:24:27.814 --> 00:24:29.715
It is impossible to explain to them.

00:24:29.981 --> 00:24:33.348
If someone says I’m God, and all that, then they are enamored.

00:24:33.648 --> 00:24:36.281
Openly if somebody declares I’m God.

00:24:36.814 --> 00:24:41.281
But that should not be in Sahaja Yoga, we should have an inner circle.

00:24:41.615 --> 00:24:45.682
Only these people should start growing, then others should follow.

00:24:45.981 --> 00:24:51.381
It should not be exposed to everyone, it won’t help much

00:24:51.515 --> 00:24:55.114
and to me also it doesn’t give pleasure

00:24:55.914 --> 00:24:59.481
because the vibrations are not sucked in and

00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:04.181
I have to carry the load upon myself for quite some time

00:25:04.314 --> 00:25:09.314
till I deliver it to the atmosphere.

00:25:09.814 --> 00:25:13.048
So it’s a very different system we have.

00:25:13.415 --> 00:25:18.581
We seldom allow people to join us in the puja, only people

00:25:18.682 --> 00:25:24.081
about whom we are convinced that they are alright we allow them.

00:25:24.348 --> 00:25:28.014
So though it’s a hasty one today we have done I’m sure

00:25:28.148 --> 00:25:33.148
you people in Belgium will try to receive more don’t think about it.

00:25:33.214 --> 00:25:36.148
Just expose your body to it,

00:25:36.214 --> 00:25:39.548
expose your mind to it and get as much as possible.

00:25:39.814 --> 00:25:42.148
Because I think now in Belgium I will be here

00:25:42.181 --> 00:25:44.181
only after a year or so, not before that.

00:25:44.682 --> 00:25:47.081
But you all can come to London some time.

00:25:47.314 --> 00:25:50.847
There’s a puja now, there’s a very good puja of Navaratri.

00:25:51.081 --> 00:25:55.847
We must have one big puja for Navaratri in London itself

00:25:56.415 --> 00:26:00.114
and I think it not very far away, you people can come for that puja.

00:26:00.214 --> 00:26:06.481
That's the beginning of the nine days,

00:26:07.148 --> 00:26:12.314
nine incarnations of the Goddess when she came on this earth

00:26:12.648 --> 00:26:15.715
to kill the demons and the devils

00:26:15.947 --> 00:26:21.248
who were troubling the devotees and the seekers and

00:26:21.947 --> 00:26:26.381
one has to also know about that part of knowledge, it is very important.

00:26:26.548 --> 00:26:29.548
These books, luckily some of them are translated.

00:26:29.981 --> 00:26:33.515
If you go through them then it will be easier for you to understand.

00:26:33.881 --> 00:26:38.881
As I told you that India is the root and you are the shoot,

00:26:39.181 --> 00:26:42.114
so the knowledge is more known to Indians,

00:26:42.214 --> 00:26:44.114
as science knowledge is known to you,

00:26:44.248 --> 00:26:47.048
knowledge about God is known to them.

00:26:47.715 --> 00:26:50.214
And so there should be no harm in learning about it

00:26:50.281 --> 00:26:53.548
because you are all seekers you are not scientists.

00:26:53.748 --> 00:26:56.748
You are seekers of the science of God.

00:26:56.814 --> 00:27:01.181
So the best thing is to get this into yourselves, open up yourselves,

00:27:01.481 --> 00:27:04.448
receive the blessings by which you grow.

00:27:04.581 --> 00:27:08.648
It’s like sunshine to the plants.

00:27:10.281 --> 00:27:11.782
May God bless you. Don’t think.

00:27:11.814 --> 00:27:13.381
As it is I have stopped your thinking,

00:27:13.481 --> 00:27:17.981
but try to receive as much as possible with humility.
