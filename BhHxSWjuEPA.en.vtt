00:01.465 --> 00:04.668
Shri Mataji's speech and subtitles start at 21:56

00:05.689 --> 00:08.178
Devi Puja, Patricia Deene’s House Gent (Belgium) 22-9-1982

21:56.248 --> 22:00.181
This is the first time we are having a puja in Belgium.

22:00.515 --> 22:05.682
That’s very quick for a puja to be done like that.

22:05.914 --> 22:10.381
Normally we don’t allow people to come to puja

22:10.481 --> 22:14.181
unless and until they are established Sahaja yogis.

22:14.682 --> 22:21.448
Because sometimes if they are half-baked, it harms them more

22:21.847 --> 22:28.615
in the way that they start doubting and thinking about it.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.648
But in the puja you should stop thinking,

22:32.214 --> 22:34.415
do not doubt, do not think,

22:34.881 --> 22:37.615
then you have the best advantage out of it.

22:37.947 --> 22:41.881
As far as I’m concerned,

22:42.782 --> 22:48.682
my chakras start working sometimes with a great force.

22:48.914 --> 22:51.581
Say if Gavin does puja, he is such a great Sahaja yogi

22:51.648 --> 22:57.114
that the deities can start emitting lots of vibrations.

22:57.648 --> 23:00.114
But if you are not in the receiving mood,

23:00.314 --> 23:03.814
then it takes time for me to take out the vibrations

23:04.114 --> 23:08.981
in the atmosphere or in another awareness.

23:09.348 --> 23:14.715
So it becomes more difficult for me to have a puja, because sometimes

23:15.048 --> 23:20.981
I do suffer with overflowing vibrations which you cannot suck in.

23:21.515 --> 23:27.348
So today as we have ventured to have this puja for all of you,

23:27.881 --> 23:33.314
please try to receive, humble down yourselves in your hearts.

23:33.448 --> 23:40.148
Only through your hearts you can receive the blessings of this puja.

23:40.814 --> 23:47.314
It's a very higher state when you can do that,

23:47.914 --> 23:55.481
but it's alright with Sahaja yoga, they are aware, all the deities

23:55.648 --> 24:00.281
that you are still children, you can make mistakes

24:00.715 --> 24:05.947
and you are seekers and you are especially blessed by me.

24:06.515 --> 24:09.715
It's not difficult in India because the one who raises the kundalini

24:09.881 --> 24:14.682
like this of masses of people definitely establishes me

24:14.847 --> 24:17.847
in their hearts, that I’m the primordial Mother.

24:17.981 --> 24:21.648
Because it's written in so many books so they don’t have this problem.

24:21.947 --> 24:24.881
While here people have not heard about Holy Ghost and

24:25.114 --> 24:27.682
it’s a secret for them and they just can’t understand.

24:27.814 --> 24:29.715
It is impossible to explain to them.

24:29.981 --> 24:33.348
If someone says I’m God, and all that, then they are enamored.

24:33.648 --> 24:36.281
Openly if somebody declares I’m God.

24:36.814 --> 24:41.281
But that should not be in Sahaja Yoga, we should have an inner circle.

24:41.615 --> 24:45.682
Only these people should start growing, then others should follow.

24:45.981 --> 24:51.381
It should not be exposed to everyone, it won’t help much

24:51.515 --> 24:55.114
and to me also it doesn’t give pleasure

24:55.914 --> 24:59.481
because the vibrations are not sucked in and

25:00.081 --> 25:04.181
I have to carry the load upon myself for quite some time

25:04.314 --> 25:09.314
till I deliver it to the atmosphere.

25:09.814 --> 25:13.048
So it’s a very different system we have.

25:13.415 --> 25:18.581
We seldom allow people to join us in the puja, only people

25:18.682 --> 25:24.081
about whom we are convinced that they are alright we allow them.

25:24.348 --> 25:28.014
So though it’s a hasty one today we have done I’m sure

25:28.148 --> 25:33.148
you people in Belgium will try to receive more don’t think about it.

25:33.214 --> 25:36.148
Just expose your body to it,

25:36.214 --> 25:39.548
expose your mind to it and get as much as possible.

25:39.814 --> 25:42.148
Because I think now in Belgium I will be here

25:42.181 --> 25:44.181
only after a year or so, not before that.

25:44.682 --> 25:47.081
But you all can come to London some time.

25:47.314 --> 25:50.847
There’s a puja now, there’s a very good puja of Navaratri.

25:51.081 --> 25:55.847
We must have one big puja for Navaratri in London itself

25:56.415 --> 26:00.114
and I think it not very far away, you people can come for that puja.

26:00.214 --> 26:06.481
That's the beginning of the nine days,

26:07.148 --> 26:12.314
nine incarnations of the Goddess when she came on this earth

26:12.648 --> 26:15.715
to kill the demons and the devils

26:15.947 --> 26:21.248
who were troubling the devotees and the seekers and

26:21.947 --> 26:26.381
one has to also know about that part of knowledge, it is very important.

26:26.548 --> 26:29.548
These books, luckily some of them are translated.

26:29.981 --> 26:33.515
If you go through them then it will be easier for you to understand.

26:33.881 --> 26:38.881
As I told you that India is the root and you are the shoot,

26:39.181 --> 26:42.114
so the knowledge is more known to Indians,

26:42.214 --> 26:44.114
as science knowledge is known to you,

26:44.248 --> 26:47.048
knowledge about God is known to them.

26:47.715 --> 26:50.214
And so there should be no harm in learning about it

26:50.281 --> 26:53.548
because you are all seekers you are not scientists.

26:53.748 --> 26:56.748
You are seekers of the science of God.

26:56.814 --> 27:01.181
So the best thing is to get this into yourselves, open up yourselves,

27:01.481 --> 27:04.448
receive the blessings by which you grow.

27:04.581 --> 27:08.648
It’s like sunshine to the plants.

27:10.281 --> 27:11.782
May God bless you. Don’t think.

27:11.814 --> 27:13.381
As it is I have stopped your thinking,

27:13.481 --> 27:17.981
but try to receive as much as possible with humility.
