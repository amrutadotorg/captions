01:24.840 --> 01:27.840
exciting

01:33.197 --> 01:36.637
Shri Mataji, the point that we were discussing this

01:36.667 --> 01:40.557
morning, we discovered here, that is the section

01:40.557 --> 01:41.936
which is quoted.

02:32.069 --> 02:36.389
Now this is the section:
“ I also tell you that you are Peter and

02:36.399 --> 02:41.029
on this rock  I will build My Church and the gates of Hades,

02:41.069 --> 02:45.389
the gates of Hell shall not prevail against her” (the church)

02:45.458 --> 02:48.873
“I will give you the keys of the kingdom of Heaven.

02:48.889 --> 02:52.571
Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in Heaven.”

02:52.601 --> 02:54.721
That was what you do on earth,

02:54.739 --> 02:57.861
I will make sure it happens in Heaven! Nonsense!

02:57.858 --> 03:01.656
“Whatever you allow on earth will be allowed in Heaven”.

03:01.669 --> 03:03.396
Shri Mataji: This is nonsense.

03:03.359 --> 03:05.079
Brian: This is nonsense. “Then He….”

03:06.179 --> 03:09.246
Shri Mataji: You see, how could He say that?

03:09.309 --> 03:11.156
Brian: How could He?

03:16.918 --> 03:20.118
Brian:  It must be true, Mother, it’s in the Bible!

03:26.648 --> 03:30.288
Shri Mataji: (unclear…) can you read there..(unclear)?

03:30.327 --> 03:35.318
Brian: “Then He forbade the disciples to say to anyone He is the Christ”

03:36.066 --> 03:40.621
So He wanted to keep it a secret or something, I don’t understand…

03:42.116 --> 03:43.171
Yes, yes.

03:46.526 --> 03:50.486
Shri Mataji:    What’s the meaning of Christ….(unclear) ?

03:51.295 --> 03:55.526
Brian:  Christ is the sacrifice, the chosen one, the chosen one

03:55.595 --> 03:58.502
of the chosen people.

04:03.602 --> 04:07.452
It’s the Greek, the Greek equivalent of the Messiah.

04:12.352 --> 04:15.614
Shri Mataji: It comes from Krishna….(inaudible)

04:16.932 --> 04:18.772
Brian:  Krist.

04:20.002 --> 04:22.828
Shri Mataji: And Yeshu comes from the…

04:23.141 --> 04:24.414
Brian: Yeshoda

04:24.542 --> 04:25.997
Shri Mataji: Yeshoda.

04:26.012 --> 04:29.577
Brian:  It’s beautiful that. But not many Christians would believe it.

04:29.692 --> 04:32.197
Shri Mataji: They wouldn’t agree with it.

04:32.291 --> 04:35.447
Brian: No. No, they’d think that was sacrilege.
