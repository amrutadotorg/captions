WEBVTT

00:04:57.667 --> 00:05:14.435
It's a great honour and  privilege for all of us to pay our respects to Her Holiness Mata Nirmala Devi ji

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.150
I have brought my children,

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.931
Aman, the elder son,    Ayan  the younger one,

00:05:23.965 --> 00:05:28.420
for Her blessings and good wishes from all of you.

00:05:29.832 --> 00:05:38.182
This is the first time they have
come to perform in Maharashtra.

00:05:48.476 --> 00:05:50.786
It's a very difficult time for classical music

00:05:50.786 --> 00:05:56.676
especially for children to continue
their studies, go to school

00:05:56.716 --> 00:05:59.766
and also practice and do sadhana.

00:05:59.766 --> 00:06:06.988
Only blessings of great people can help

00:06:07.028 --> 00:06:13.430
and we believe in blessings, good wishes.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.408
No sadhana can be successful without the blessings.

00:06:24.235 --> 00:06:29.984
This is the time everybody is after short cuts.

00:06:30.004 --> 00:06:32.830
Nobody wants to go long way,

00:06:32.882 --> 00:06:38.772
but knowingly with our full awareness
we have chosen the long way.

00:06:40.252 --> 00:06:42.752
This is tradition.

00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:52.101
And this is what Mataji's trying to teach all of us.

00:06:53.483 --> 00:06:59.996
And show that how rich culture of India, India has.

00:07:00.016 --> 00:07:06.076
So this is the seventh generation in my family who
are carrying on this tradition of sarod playing.

00:07:11.252 --> 00:07:17.672
And Safad Hussain Sahab is on the Tabla.

00:07:19.428 --> 00:07:23.348
He also represents... he comes from a family of musicians

00:07:23.378 --> 00:07:29.218
and he is very ambulant and very
popular in India and abroad.

00:07:29.252 --> 00:07:33.584
So we'll begin our recital with a Raag Yaman.

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:41.812
Very beautiful raag, traditional raag
and Yaman we'll play all of us together.

00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:50.731
And after that, maybe if Mataji orders me,
then I'll play a short solo piece also.

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:47.869
A very musical name she has Shruti.

00:08:48.237 --> 00:08:50.737
Micro tone!

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.900
A very important part of music, Shruti!

01:29:21.727 --> 01:29:31.230
I would like to introduce, we have great film
maker among us, Shri Gulzar Sahab with us today

01:29:37.998 --> 01:29:44.468
Mataji, Gulzar Sahab is making a
film on Bhimsen Joshi these days.

01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:51.760
And he has made one film on me, last year by Films Division.

01:35:26.927 --> 01:35:33.187
Some of you must be seeing me filing my nails.

01:35:35.729 --> 01:35:47.719
I would like to clarify that I have to
press the strings with the edge of my nails

01:35:47.762 --> 01:35:53.721
and that is why, every time I have
to file to equalise the grooves.

01:35:54.874 --> 01:35:59.952
But many people feel perhaps I press
the strings with the finger tips.

01:35:59.952 --> 01:36:03.384
I'll show you the sound of finger tip.

01:36:16.881 --> 01:36:19.381
Now with the nails.

01:36:19.888 --> 01:36:22.388
Wow!

02:12:40.951 --> 02:12:43.196
Thank you very much.

02:12:43.196 --> 02:12:56.206
I'm honoured. It's my privilege and honour to
present our humble music before Her Holiness.

02:12:57.025 --> 02:13:02.646
I will conclude the recital with
a bhajan, which is based on Khamaj

02:13:02.646 --> 02:13:14.506
and later on Gara. You will all recognise
very, internationally, popular bhajan.

02:39:24.982 --> 02:39:29.132
This is vibrated pani I am giving you.

02:41:07.534 --> 02:41:18.804
उसमे वाइब्रटेड पानी दे देना. आप पहनिएगा ज़रूर. आशीर्वाद. बहुत बड़िया बच्चे हैं. वाह वाह वाह क्या कहने.
Give vibrated water in it. Please do wear it. They are very nice children. Wow wow wow what to say!

02:41:19.385 --> 02:41:21.885
Please be seated.

02:41:27.073 --> 02:41:29.281
Please be seated.

02:41:42.765 --> 02:41:50.639
It was really such a unique day and such a performance.

02:41:55.837 --> 02:42:03.944
Words really are not sufficient to describe our joy,

02:42:03.954 --> 02:42:07.507
but as you are singing today about 'anand vihari'

02:42:07.548 --> 02:42:13.097
I saw all of you becoming ananda viharis absolutely.

02:42:13.131 --> 02:42:18.707
Now we have before us such a great artist.

02:42:18.788 --> 02:42:23.825
His name is, you know Ustad Amjad Ali Khan Sahab

02:42:23.855 --> 02:42:26.775
but have you seen the word Ali there?

02:42:26.815 --> 02:42:34.215
Perhaps you do not know that we
worship Ali and Fatima Bi in a puja.

02:42:34.215 --> 02:42:40.892
There’s a regular puja for them because,
to us, they are Brahamadeva itself

02:42:40.892 --> 02:42:51.232
and that’s why you will find among these Shia
people, who have got such a talent of expression.

02:42:52.671 --> 02:42:58.703
In the Quran, I am sorry to say that
Mohammed Sahab was tortured so much

02:42:58.730 --> 02:43:04.383
and also later on, as you know, Hassan
and Hussein were killed in Karbella,

02:43:04.383 --> 02:43:08.816
they had no time to talk about the universal nature.

02:43:08.836 --> 02:43:12.066
But such a great book is this Quran.

02:43:12.103 --> 02:43:16.916
We have written now some
sort of a commentary on that

02:43:19.529 --> 02:43:26.448
and it’s obvious, that he was the
incarnation of the primordial master,

02:43:26.506 --> 02:43:29.868
though he was so humble, he was so much worried

02:43:29.868 --> 02:43:36.503
that he should not be called as divine because
people will again start doing all kinds of ritualism.

02:43:37.433 --> 02:43:43.158
But now you can see, especially on tabla.

02:43:44.416 --> 02:43:48.034
Left side of a musalman is always very strong.

02:43:48.034 --> 02:43:50.534
मानी हुई बात है.
It is a well known fact.

02:43:50.534 --> 02:43:56.144
This is  the blessing of that
great incarnation of Ali.

02:43:56.204 --> 02:43:58.704
Brahamadeva incarnated only twice.

02:43:58.704 --> 02:44:04.054
One was Ali, who was not understood even
by the followers from Mohammad Sahab.

02:44:04.054 --> 02:44:06.214
It’s always so.

02:44:06.214 --> 02:44:10.194
But we know who he is and we worship him.

02:44:10.194 --> 02:44:15.334
हमारे यहाँ रेग्युलर पूजा होती है उनकी. एक पूजा में से उनकी एक पूजा है.
We regularly have His pooja here.
It is one of the poojas done

02:44:15.359 --> 02:44:21.864
and by taking his name we have
cured many diabetic patients.

02:44:21.898 --> 02:44:26.451
But before that we have to be
connected with that divine power.

02:44:27.801 --> 02:44:32.019
Now I see two great saints
sitting next to Amjad Ali Sahab.

02:44:32.019 --> 02:44:35.939
They are really saints, born
realised. You can see that.

02:44:38.317 --> 02:44:46.074
Otherwise at this young age, they cannot
be so deft. They cannot be you see.

02:44:46.074 --> 02:44:52.428
Such understanding, rapport
and deftness from last life!

02:44:52.428 --> 02:44:59.263
Might be they might have been with Tansen or
someone I don’t know, but really they are prodigies

02:44:59.283 --> 02:45:05.603
And such prodigies are now born to great artists
is also the blessing of the Divine I think.

02:45:05.603 --> 02:45:08.103
You choose your parents no doubt.

02:45:08.103 --> 02:45:18.894
But they should be born to such great artist, itself
it shows their own choice and they are saints.

02:45:18.921 --> 02:45:23.281
I am happy they have come to Maharashtra
because you know Maharashtrians

02:45:23.308 --> 02:45:28.211
are absolutely drowned into music.

02:45:28.253 --> 02:45:32.843
We had saints and saints and musicians
saints, all kinds of things,

02:45:32.843 --> 02:45:36.303
but we had no saints yet
who had playing sarod.

02:45:39.536 --> 02:45:44.030
So such beautiful things you see
nowadays happening in this world,

02:45:44.065 --> 02:45:49.784
that these great people are taking birth

02:45:49.784 --> 02:45:54.845
in the families of great artists
because they know the value of this art,

02:45:54.870 --> 02:45:59.245
of this great, classical music art.

02:45:59.297 --> 02:46:03.643
You also now realise. I know
because now you are realised souls

02:46:03.643 --> 02:46:07.815
and you understand it and you
don’t like cheap type music.

02:46:07.815 --> 02:46:10.315
But see their dignity, their style and everything!

02:46:11.825 --> 02:46:18.721
Of course I always felt Amjad
Ali was like my son. Always!

02:46:25.231 --> 02:46:27.951
He is Khan Sahab, he
is a big man I know,

02:46:27.976 --> 02:46:34.151
but I always felt that kind of a feeling
for him because he has that humility.

02:46:34.193 --> 02:46:41.233
With all that art, with all that
creativity, he is so humble.

02:46:43.403 --> 02:46:48.543
He is not at all conscious of his own achievements at all.

02:46:53.172 --> 02:46:58.171
I give really a great credit to
him and to his two children also.

02:46:58.207 --> 02:47:01.617
You know how difficult it is for me
to be your mother and your guru.

02:47:01.617 --> 02:47:04.547
It is a very difficult situation.

02:47:04.577 --> 02:47:08.051
In the same way a father being
your guru is very difficult,

02:47:08.088 --> 02:47:13.760
especially for such a music
which requires complete तपश्चर्या

02:47:13.764 --> 02:47:18.700
complete dedication and complete respect of your guru.

02:47:18.700 --> 02:47:21.200
When he is your father,

02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:26.286
it’s very difficult. I don’t know how
things are being managed by these children

02:47:26.286 --> 02:47:30.200
and how they have imbibed these things
and such respect for their father.

02:47:30.213 --> 02:47:32.713
Because they see what art he has.

02:47:36.496 --> 02:47:44.043
I feel a great vision is
before Me of this great music

02:47:44.043 --> 02:47:50.276
and through music you have seen the chaitanya,
the vibrations are carried everywhere.

02:47:50.336 --> 02:48:00.296
So how far can you think of the dimensions in
which all this beautiful, divine music will spread.

02:48:03.072 --> 02:48:09.696
I invite also Ustad Amjad Ali Khan
Sahab  to my house in Cabella.

02:48:18.504 --> 02:48:21.750
I am not such a rich person.

02:48:21.784 --> 02:48:29.780
I won’t be able to really give you support you,
the way I would like to support all the artists.

02:48:29.780 --> 02:48:33.800
By all the audience, I always say they
have got the blessings of the Saraswati,

02:48:33.821 --> 02:48:36.350
but you must look after their Lakshmi side.

02:48:36.402 --> 02:48:39.542
But I am not so well off I should say.

02:48:39.562 --> 02:48:45.075
Whatever is possible, I would try
to look after, especially there.

02:48:45.195 --> 02:48:47.695
We need your blessings, your love.

02:48:47.695 --> 02:48:53.938
आइए तो सही. देखिए आपका घर है बच्चों को भी ले आइए.
Please do come. It’s your own home. Get children also.

02:48:53.971 --> 02:48:58.938
With what meditative mood he was singing,
just think and he put you into meditation.

02:49:00.308 --> 02:49:07.372
Of course Yaman raga  is a
very simple, beautiful raga,

02:49:07.405 --> 02:49:11.294
but the way he played and his
children. I must say this

02:49:11.315 --> 02:49:16.304
I’ve never heard such Yaman raga
before. Never heard. I must confess.

02:49:16.324 --> 02:49:22.654
I must... I am the oldest, oldest woman here.
I have heard all kinds of people all my life,

02:49:22.696 --> 02:49:26.101
but never such good Yaman raga I have heard.

02:49:26.117 --> 02:49:28.617
It’s such a...  you see trigun,

02:49:28.617 --> 02:49:34.856
because it was not jugalbandi but
three persons trigunamika was playing.

02:49:41.391 --> 02:49:47.537
With such poise, such dignity, such beauty!

02:49:47.564 --> 02:49:49.007
You all have enjoyed.

02:49:49.037 --> 02:49:51.897
I don’t know how to thank Amjad Ali Sahab

02:49:51.922 --> 02:49:57.167
for coming himself and bringing
his children to give us this joy.

02:50:06.347 --> 02:50:09.887
Also the raga Darbari  Kanada,

02:50:09.917 --> 02:50:17.347
which you all appreciate very much and enjoy. But
I think you really got lost with him completely.

02:50:17.387 --> 02:50:24.269
It was very meditative, very, very meditative and
I think all your thoughts had stopped completely.

02:50:24.299 --> 02:50:28.799
You had reached a state of nirvichara.

02:50:28.832 --> 02:50:34.039
I also, was in another world of music.

02:50:35.475 --> 02:50:44.167
Then the khamaj and the bhajan which was
the favourite song of Mahatma Gandhi.

02:50:44.207 --> 02:50:51.987
Unfortunately Mahatma Gandhi never knew how
to play any sarod nor he knew how to sing.

02:50:52.026 --> 02:50:55.963
You know I have been with him
as a child for years together.

02:50:55.975 --> 02:50:58.475
But such an interesting person he was

02:50:58.475 --> 02:51:01.465
that he could immediately make out

02:51:01.465 --> 02:51:06.495
if somebody was making any mistakes
in the tala or in the swaras.

02:51:06.550 --> 02:51:12.143
Surprisingly, he never knew Indian
music, but he had that spirit within him.

02:51:12.171 --> 02:51:19.366
Immediately he used to say, this is
wrong and he respected music very much.

02:51:19.366 --> 02:51:23.831
Very much he respected music and in his music he.......

02:51:23.861 --> 02:51:29.191
you know that very well that his भजानवली “list
of hymns” was selected by me quite a lot,

02:51:29.183 --> 02:51:32.631
especially the first prayers of his.

02:51:32.651 --> 02:51:35.151
He used to ask me,

02:51:35.151 --> 02:51:40.484
though he was a realised soul, he used
people who were of very mundane type,

02:51:40.511 --> 02:51:45.270
very ordinary, materialistic people
for the freedom of this country.

02:51:45.306 --> 02:51:48.806
I don’t know, he was

02:51:48.846 --> 02:51:55.516
like some sort of a पारस पत्थर as they say
who just touches something becomes gold.

02:51:55.557 --> 02:52:07.369
He was that kind of a leader, who gave us such a
great idea of सर्वधर्म स्मानत्व (all religions equal)

02:52:07.389 --> 02:52:10.609
But more than that is in Sahaja Yoga.

02:52:10.629 --> 02:52:16.129
We do not feel that all dharma’s are
equal, but we worship all of them.

02:52:22.799 --> 02:52:25.950
इबादत करते हैं सबके.
We worship all.

02:52:25.987 --> 02:52:33.516
All of them because they were all great people
born on the tree of life as beautiful flowers.

02:52:33.583 --> 02:52:36.776
Now you pluck them and the
dead flowers you fight,

02:52:36.828 --> 02:52:40.796
but they worked only for divinity
and spirituality and nothing else.

02:52:40.796 --> 02:52:44.066
How could they work for anything else?

02:52:44.066 --> 02:52:50.194
But we have, as human beings, always
tried to make a mess of everything.

02:52:50.194 --> 02:52:54.986
But Sahaja Yoga – all the
Sahaja Yogis worship them

02:52:58.516 --> 02:53:00.072
and this is the difference.

02:53:00.073 --> 02:53:05.082
Just feeling the same way about
say Hindu, Muslims and all that

02:53:05.123 --> 02:53:13.479
is different from to worship Mohammed
Sahab, as well as Shri Rama, or Shri Krishna.

02:53:13.508 --> 02:53:17.819
It’s much deeper, because we know they are all one.

02:53:17.856 --> 02:53:20.886
They said the same thing.

02:53:20.926 --> 02:53:24.726
They never wanted to create problems like this

02:53:24.756 --> 02:53:27.886
and in the music you find

02:53:27.896 --> 02:53:40.656
you forget all your differences, your
so-called brands, your countries, nations.

02:53:40.672 --> 02:53:44.465
Now you won’t believe there are
55 nations sitting before you.

02:53:44.482 --> 02:53:46.982
Fifty five nations.

02:53:51.012 --> 02:53:58.548
We have Muslims from Iran, from Algeria, from Tunisia.

02:53:58.563 --> 02:54:08.574
Also there are so many of them, who are
now absolutely achieved a state of Sufis.

02:54:11.742 --> 02:54:17.424
We respect and worship all the great saints.

02:54:19.798 --> 02:54:30.595
In India also we had a very big movement
I should say of the great saints.

02:54:30.616 --> 02:54:43.840
As निज़ामुद्दीन ख़ान साहब You know that Nizamuddin was  another realised soul, Chishti  where they sing in the qawallis.

02:54:45.420 --> 02:54:47.350
They've  never... how could Mohammad Sahab

02:54:47.350 --> 02:54:51.820
say that you should not have
music? How is it possible?

02:54:51.838 --> 02:54:53.993
How can it be?

02:54:53.983 --> 02:54:57.366
It’s absolutely wrong, impossible.

02:54:57.423 --> 02:55:02.686
there’s not much of a difference
between “Vaishnavajana” and the sufis.

02:55:02.726 --> 02:55:04.346
They are just the same.

02:55:04.346 --> 02:55:13.174
How could he say such a thing and how
could Christ say that you can have wine?

02:55:13.209 --> 02:55:15.874
All this is some sort of a manipulation I think.

02:55:15.899 --> 02:55:19.704
Is impossible. Music is divine.

02:55:19.734 --> 02:55:23.482
Of course cheap type music would be very different.

02:55:23.515 --> 02:55:28.182
But without music, how are
you going to worship God?

02:55:28.187 --> 02:55:30.687
How are you going to feel Him?

02:55:30.687 --> 02:55:35.532
Only at the time of meditation you can be silent.

02:55:35.577 --> 02:55:43.807
But this music, that you have heard today, has
shown you how we were all tied in one sutra;

02:55:43.833 --> 02:55:48.807
into one beautiful feeling of one-ness.

02:55:48.871 --> 02:55:51.371
So many countries are here.

02:55:51.371 --> 02:55:54.501
They have never learnt any classical music.

02:55:54.501 --> 02:55:59.211
They don’t know any ragas. They
don’t know any talas. Nothing!

02:55:59.211 --> 02:56:04.690
But the way they appreciate you’ll be surprised,
it’s only because now they have become the spirit.

02:56:04.726 --> 02:56:08.590
रूह बन गयी. They are रूह (spirit) now.

02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:14.826
और रूहानी ज़िंदगी में संगीत का बड़ा कार्य है
And music has a great role in spiritual life,

02:56:14.860 --> 02:56:29.403
इसीलिए मैं इसको बहुत ज़्यादा जितना भी हो सकता है उतना चाहती हूँ की उसे प्रोत्साहन हो उसको प्रमोट करूँ उसको आगे  बड़ाऊ जितना मुझसे बन पड़ता है.
that’s why I want to support it as much as possible, encourage it, promote it, promote it as much as I can.

02:56:29.445 --> 02:56:41.243
क्योंकि दूसरा बड़ा भारी काम मुझे करना है की अनेक लोगों को उस परमात्मा की शक्ति से एकाकारिता दें.
Because I have to do another big heavy work to give unity to many people with the power of God.

02:56:42.413 --> 02:56:55.357
लेकिन ये भी एक संगीत माध्यम् बन गया और जब अमज़द अली साहब जैसे लोग हैं और सफ़ाद हुसैन जैसे ताल्बध्ध लोग हैं तो कुछ मुश्किल नही होगा.
But this also became a musical medium and when there are people like Amjad Ali sahab and rhythmic people like Safad Hussain, then nothing will be difficult.

02:56:55.413 --> 02:57:10.355
मैं तो हर बार देखती हूँ की ये नये नये मुखड़े पता नही कहाँ से ले आते हैं हर बार कभी इन्होने रिपीट नही किये. जीतने बार भी सुनिये नये ही मुखड़े बजा लेते हैं पता नही कैसे.
I see every time that I don’t know from where they get these new choruses, they have never repeated them every time.

02:57:10.371 --> 02:57:18.739
सब चीज़ें इतनी सुंदर हैं इतनी दैवीय और इतनी आनंद दाई हैं की उनका वर्णन तो नही किया जा सकता
Everything is so beautiful, so divine and so blissful that it cannot be described,

02:57:18.739 --> 02:57:34.416
लेकिन हमारे सहजयोग में हर योगी के हृदय में आप सब artist के लिए नितांत श्रद्धा और आपको सब बहुत प्रेम और आदर से देखते हैं.
but in our Sahaja Yoga, every yogi has a lot of reverence for all of you artists and looks at you all with great love and respect.

02:57:34.428 --> 02:57:49.250
इसकी ये वजह नही की मेरे ही कारण है इसकी ये भी वजह है की जानते हैं की इनके गाने से हमारी जो अंदर शक्तियाँ है वो दैविक हो जाती है
The reason for this is not because it is because of me, it is also because we know that by singing his songs, our inner powers become divine.

02:57:49.279 --> 02:57:51.480
इन लोग का नूर ही बदल गया
The light [Aura/divine light] of these people has changed,

02:57:51.480 --> 02:58:04.841
मैं तो कहती हू इनके genetics बदल गए सबके और ये चीज़ में जो भी हुआ है जो भी घटित हुआ है जो भी चीज़ बन पड़ी है उसमे आप कलाकारो का बड़ा भारी हाथ है.
I can say that their genetics have changed and you artists have a big hand in whatever has happened, whatever has happened.

02:58:04.872 --> 02:58:08.920
इसलिए मैं आपको बहुत धन्यवाद देती हू इसके लिए.
That’s why I thank you very much for this.

02:58:16.064 --> 02:58:18.886
Want to say something now Rajesh?

02:58:18.937 --> 02:58:19.776
Gregoire?

02:58:20.496 --> 02:58:23.967
ये कहीं से टोपियाँ लेके आए हैं आपको खुश करने के लिए.
They have got caps from somewhere to please you.

02:58:24.003 --> 02:58:27.806
You are not supposed to wear topis
in front of such great artists.

02:58:27.841 --> 02:58:30.341
उतारलीजिए. Please remove.

02:58:38.801 --> 02:58:43.291
Shri Mataji it’s very difficult
to use words after music

02:58:43.291 --> 02:58:49.401
and it’s very difficult to use
words after you have spoken.

02:58:49.411 --> 02:58:55.631
We heard many performances of great musicians, but

02:58:55.692 --> 02:59:09.404
as soon as these great artists came in, we
felt that we would be in your दरबार at home

02:59:09.444 --> 02:59:19.064
with someone who would play with the strings
of our heart and that’s what happened.

02:59:19.074 --> 02:59:23.194
We were I don’t know where Shri Mataji.

02:59:23.194 --> 02:59:26.300
Certainly in joy!

02:59:26.324 --> 02:59:28.824
We were feeling the closeness.

02:59:30.394 --> 02:59:40.554
We were proud of him as if we
were his children or his family.

02:59:40.553 --> 02:59:44.544
This is strange to have such a
feeling for someone one has never met.

02:59:52.394 --> 03:00:00.228
We all see so very much and enjoy the joyful
and buoyant performance of the tabla player

03:00:00.248 --> 03:00:04.788
who was sending notes of merriness and joy

03:00:04.806 --> 03:00:12.344
and we were very impressed by
the children of the great artist.

03:00:12.351 --> 03:00:25.087
Shri Mataji, on behalf of all the Sahajis of all
the world I would like also to thank Rajesh Shah,

03:00:25.123 --> 03:00:31.021
who has provided us the opportunity
to see you so pleased Shri Mataji,

03:00:31.021 --> 03:00:34.523
because this is what we have enjoyed.

03:00:40.209 --> 03:00:46.489
So, in so many words, thank you very much
for an exceptional evening. Thank you.

03:00:49.089 --> 03:00:53.989
Here is something small from you all to them.

03:00:55.069 --> 03:00:58.189
ये इन लोगों ने कुछ आपके लिए इंतज़ामात किए हुए हैं.
These people have made some arrangements for you.

03:00:58.189 --> 03:01:05.689
इसको मान लीजिए थोड़ी सी चीज़ सब को मिलकरके जो कुछ हो पाया.
Consider it a small thing, whatever was possible by working together.

03:01:06.937 --> 03:01:10.737
अभी दस दिन हर रोज़ रात को एक एक आर्टिस्ट आते रहे.
Now for ten days, every night let one artist come.

03:01:22.081 --> 03:01:25.663
तो हमारे बात को आप टालिएगा नहीं.
Please do come.

03:01:26.439 --> 03:01:28.583
आपको आना होगा कबेला
You have to come to Cabella

03:01:28.583 --> 03:01:36.442
और वहाँ पर एक बहुत ऊपर में ऐसी जगह बनी है कि वहाँ बैठ करके आप बस गाते ही रहिए या बजाते ही रहिए.
and there is such a place at the very top that you just keep on singing or playing while sitting there.

03:01:36.442 --> 03:01:40.468
बहुत सुंदर जगह. एकदम शांत नीरव जगह.
Very beautiful place. Very quiet place.

03:01:40.488 --> 03:01:44.992
आप तो आ चुके हैं, आपने ऊपर की जगह देखी है हमारी?
You have come, have you seen our place above?

03:01:45.011 --> 03:01:50.122
इतमीनान से आइए और रहिए आपकी माँ का घर है आराम से बच्चों को भी ले आइए.
Come and stay in peace, it is your mother’s house, get your children.

03:01:50.144 --> 03:02:05.823
हाँ ज़रूर इनके लिए तो हमने खास चीज़ कही है की ये हमारी साड़ी ज़रूर पहनेंगी. अच्छा?  इनमें तो इतना फ़रक अगया है बाप रे. बहुत खुश.
Yes. Please. We have asked her for a special thing, please do wear this saree. You have changed so much. Very pleased.

03:02:05.846 --> 03:02:07.648
माताजी आपका इज़ाज़त हो तो मैं,

03:02:07.648 --> 03:02:10.148
I would like to say a few words.

03:02:11.954 --> 03:02:17.760
On behalf of Mataji, when Pragya Srivastav rang us up

03:02:17.789 --> 03:02:23.410
she wrote a formal letter and since I
deal with Khan Sahab’s correspondence

03:02:23.414 --> 03:02:29.862
I just said in a normal way I started writing
since Mataji said about Lakshmi and Saraswati

03:02:29.862 --> 03:02:34.254
I have to mention this to you.
I wrote that Lakshmi part of it.

03:02:34.287 --> 03:02:38.647
Then she wrote saying Mataji is going
to be here and this is a संस्था

03:02:38.670 --> 03:02:43.847
I said you asked me that’s why I wrote. I
didn’t say you have to do anything for us.

03:02:43.847 --> 03:02:45.997
We just need your blessings

03:02:45.997 --> 03:02:51.287
and I humbly requested to Pragya
ji and told her I’ll be very happy.

03:02:51.311 --> 03:02:56.307
We both will be really honoured and
blessed if Mataji bless the children.

03:02:56.291 --> 03:03:00.475
So this is the first time we plan to
bring mainly because of You Mataji.

03:03:00.475 --> 03:03:01.661
May God Bless.

03:03:01.661 --> 03:03:07.561
and the children and fourteen years
ago when I was with Khan Sahab,

03:03:07.583 --> 03:03:16.511
marrying a handsome man and marrying an artist, who is loved by all was a very difficult job for me to face the world

03:03:17.296 --> 03:03:20.921
and I did not know marrying
a musician where I ended.

03:03:20.921 --> 03:03:25.204
And I was very disturbed when I went to
Mataji and I literally started crying.

03:03:25.245 --> 03:03:29.444
She took me to a room and sat with Her.  She blessed me.

03:03:29.488 --> 03:03:34.824
Ever since then I don’t think I have
ever looked back with Her blessings. And...

03:03:34.889 --> 03:03:39.050
And she has cooled down since then.

03:03:41.898 --> 03:03:53.604
Art and culture I think without the love of people, the listeners and of course the blessings of people like Mataji and God it cannot be music.

03:03:53.627 --> 03:04:00.699
So I think with all Your blessings and all your
blessings Mataji, may it flourish more and more.

03:04:00.729 --> 03:04:03.221
May God bless you. May God bless you.

03:04:18.058 --> 03:04:22.818
इन लोगों ने इंतज़ाम किया है आपके लिए मेरा कोई इंतज़ाम नहीं है.
These people have organised it for you, I have not done anything.

03:05:10.754 --> 03:05:15.916
इसको बड़ाते जाइएएगा. इस पानी को बड़ाते जाईएगा.
Please take this vibrated water. Keep increasing it.

03:05:20.563 --> 03:05:27.013
तीन डॉक्टर ओं को देल्ही में MD मिल गया है सहज योग मे. बिमरिया ठीक कर दी. Dr Rai आए हुए हैं यहाँ पर.
3 Doctors have got MD in Sahaja Yoga. They have treated diseases. Dr Rai is here.

03:05:27.016 --> 03:05:31.508
इन्होने अभी किताब लिखी हुई है. यहाँ पर बैठे हैं.
He has written a book. He is sitting here.

03:05:43.650 --> 03:05:47.363
कभी कभी शराब जैसी टेस्ट आजाती है. कोई हर्ज़ नहीं.
It tastes like wine sometimes. Doesn’t matter.

03:05:48.887 --> 03:05:56.617
This is what happened when Christ vibrated the
water. It became... tasted like the grape juice.

03:05:56.645 --> 03:05:59.145
But they said it was wine.

03:05:59.145 --> 03:06:02.987
But this is the word used in
Hebrew, wine for a grape juice.

03:06:03.026 --> 03:06:06.976
How can you make wine in one
minute, instantaneously?

03:06:06.976 --> 03:06:13.200
It has to ferment. It has to rot. It has to become
absolutely rotten, otherwise it’s not wine.

03:06:13.217 --> 03:06:16.476
So this is such a misunderstanding.

03:06:19.857 --> 03:06:22.964
That’s why Mohammed Sahab had
to say it again and again.

03:06:23.026 --> 03:06:30.807
इसको माना कर दिया. उस व्क़त नहीं थी तो नानक साहब ने कहाँ मत पियो. कोई अच्छी चीज़ें थोड़ी हैं.
Nanak Sahab also said the same. It is not a good thing

03:06:30.838 --> 03:06:34.529
Mataji, मोहम्मद साहब को अज़ान सुनने का बड़ा शौक था.
Mohammad Sahib was very fond of listening to Azan.

03:06:34.529 --> 03:06:35.708
किसका?
Of what?

03:06:35.708 --> 03:06:36.758
अज़ान जो देते हैं.
Azan

03:06:36.758 --> 03:06:39.258
हाँ.
Yes

03:06:39.273 --> 03:06:41.773
ऐसे सुर में अज़ान देते थे.
He used to give Azaan in such a tone

03:06:41.773 --> 03:06:44.273
उन्होने जितना आपका नमाज़ है, वो नमाज़ क्या चीज़ है मालूम है आपको?
Do you know what Namaaz  is?

03:06:44.273 --> 03:06:50.208
कुण्डलिनी का जागरण. हमारे यहाँ तो मंत्र है अल्लाह हो अकबर.
Awakening of Kundalini. Our mantra here is Allah Ho Akbar.

03:06:50.224 --> 03:06:52.724
उसके बगैर गला नहीं ठीक होगा.
Throat will not heal without it.

03:06:53.604 --> 03:07:05.444
आप ये बात समझ लीजिए की कहाँ मोहम्मद साहब हैं और कहाँ सब लोग हैं और कैसे इनकी रिश्तेदारी है और हम लोग बेकार ही में परेशान हो रहे हैं.
You should understand where Mohammad Sahab is and where all the people are and how are they related and we are unnecessarily getting worried.

03:07:05.444 --> 03:07:12.176
अब ये लोग बैठ ही गए ना उसपे. ये समझने की चीज़ है. और आप लोग पहले समझ सकते हो क्योंकि आप लोग आर्टिस्ट है
Now these people have sat on it, haven’t they? It is something to be understood. And you can understand first because you are artists.

03:07:12.221 --> 03:07:14.162
You must explain to them ?

03:07:14.163 --> 03:07:17.702
आप लोग किसी दिन जा करके. आप दिल्ली में रहते हैं ना?
You go someday. You live in Delhi don’t you?

03:07:17.738 --> 03:07:22.082
हाँ, Dr साहब आप कभी जा करके समझाइये क्या चीज़ है.
Yes, Dr sir, you go sometime and explain what it is.

03:07:26.680 --> 03:07:34.475
इसको इतनी गहराई से आप जान जाइएगा और असलियत में की ये tangible है. आप महसूस कर सकते हैं.
You will know it so deeply and in reality
that it is tangible. You can feel.

03:07:34.505 --> 03:07:37.005
अब उन्होने कहा ना “वैष्णव जन तो तेने कहिये “
Now he said, “Vaishnav jan to tene kahiye”.

03:07:37.005 --> 03:07:40.465
अब ये सब वैष्णव हैं क्योंकि central path से ये सब उठे हुए हैं.
Now all these are Vaishnavas because they all have risen from the central path.

03:07:40.451 --> 03:07:49.991
इस्लिये वैष्णव हैं ये सब. और “जो पीर पराई जाने रे” अब पीर पराई ये लोग दिमाग़ से नही जानते, उंगलियों के इशारे पे.
That's why all of them are Vaishnavas. And “Jo pir parai jaane re” Now these people don’t know about “ peer parayi” not by their mind, on the their fingers

03:07:50.010 --> 03:07:52.971
सारा diagnosis उंगलियों पे होता है.
All the diagnosis is done on the fingers.

03:07:54.677 --> 03:07:59.276
इसके लिए doctor के पास जाने की ज़रूरत नही, कुछ नही उंगलियों पे बता सकते हैं किसका क्या चक्र पकड़ा है.
There is no need to go to the doctor for this. Everything can be told on the fingers which chakra has been caught.

03:07:59.309 --> 03:08:04.826
किसका नहीं पकड़ा है. कौन realised soul है कौन नही.
Whose has not been caught. Who is a realised soul and who is not.

03:08:04.855 --> 03:08:12.544
ठगा नही सकते क्योंकि वहाँ पहुच गये हैं जहाँ absolute truth है अब इनको कोई ठगा नहीं सकता.
Can’t cheat because they have reached the place where there is absolute truth, now no one can cheat them.

03:08:15.043 --> 03:08:18.759
और इस दशा में चाहती हूँ की अपने देश के मुसलमान आजाएँ.
And in this situation, I want the Muslims of our country to come.

03:08:18.812 --> 03:08:24.959
एक तो मुझे कभी कभी रोना आता है देखके बहुत ग़रीबी  में बहुत परेशानी में इतने सालों से है.
Firstly, I feel like crying sometimes seeing that they have been in a lot of trouble in poverty for so many years.

03:08:24.989 --> 03:08:29.338
उनको किसी तरह से वो स्थान मिला ही नही जो मिलना चाहिए था.
Somehow they did not get the place which they should have got.

03:08:29.354 --> 03:08:33.128
कितने सारे आर्टिस्ट हैं जिनको मैं जानती हूँ जो बहुत परेशानी मे है.
There are so many artists whom I know who are in distress.

03:08:33.148 --> 03:08:37.608
उसकी वजह ये ही है की हर समय अलग अलग हटाते गये हटाते गये.
The reason for this is that all the time they kept on saying you are separate.

03:08:37.634 --> 03:08:39.928
तुम कोई दूसरे, तुम कोई दूसरे.
You someone else, you someone else.

03:08:39.928 --> 03:08:46.447
इसीलये सारी परेशानियाँ है और ग़रीबी इस कदर है की मैं तो देख नही सकती.
That’s why there are so many problems and poverty is so much that I can’t see.

03:08:48.175 --> 03:08:52.427
इतने बड़े बड़े आर्टिस्ट हैं इतने बड़े बड़े आर्टिस्ट हैं और बिल्कुल ग़रीब.
There are so many big artists, so many big artists and very poor.

03:08:55.854 --> 03:09:07.004
जब समझ आएगी तब आएगी समझ. की हम सब एक हैं कIहे के लिए झगड़ा कIहे के लिए. तो आप सहज को समझ लिजिये.
When there is understanding then there will be understanding. That we all are one for what to fight for. So you understand Sahaj.

03:09:07.019 --> 03:09:14.137
ये तो सब वली बैठे हैं आपके सामने. और आप भी वली हो गए अब.
All of them are sitting in front of you. And you have also become one now.

03:09:14.157 --> 03:09:21.886
आपके भी तो हाथ में ठंडक अराही है. देखिए बच्चो से पूचिये. हाथ हमारी और करो बेटा. देखो ऐसे दोनो हाथ करो. दोनो हाथ ऐसे.
You also have coolness in your hands. See, ask the children. Do your hands like this, son. Look, do both hands like this. Both hands like this.

03:09:21.916 --> 03:09:31.178
हमारी और. ऐसे हाथ करिए. दोनो दोनो हाथ. आरही है ठंडक? आरही है ना.
Towards me. Keep hands like this. Both hands. Is it getting cold? Isn’t it?

03:09:31.204 --> 03:09:38.644
ये तो पार ही पैदा हुए हैं. आप देखिए आपके भी अराही  है. आपके  तो आ ही रहे थे पहले भी. आपके आरही हैं बेटा?
They are born realised. You see, you also are feeling it. For you it was coming earlier also. Coming son?

03:09:38.670 --> 03:09:47.988
इनके तो खूब ज़ोरों में. और यहाँ पर भी सर से भी निकल रहा है. ठंडक सिर से निकल रहा है.
