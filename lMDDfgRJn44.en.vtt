00:00:05.387 --> 00:00:11.629
Today we are going to worship the Hamsa Chakra.

00:00:11.756 --> 00:00:18.990
So far we have been always worshipping a Deity

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:28.223
and this is the second time you are worshipping this centre of Hamsa.

00:00:29.826 --> 00:00:38.955
Now this chakra is, it is, you know, placed between the two eyebrows

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.229
and two eyes represent the left and the right side.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:59.137
So this centre is very much guided by our eyes,

00:00:59.217 --> 00:01:08.821
by our ears, by our nose, tongue, teeth, throat.

00:01:11.421 --> 00:01:20.628
Is a very important centre because the Vishuddhi, which has to look after sixteen petals, which,

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:26.699
sixteen petals, which look after all these ear, nose, throat,

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:36.275
different, different organs within us, also it has to communicate with the Viraat.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.749
So it has to pass through this centre of Hamsa Chakra.

00:01:48.555 --> 00:01:58.661
Hamsa Chakra is the very pivotal centre,

00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:06.865
which expresses auspiciousness in our awareness.

00:02:06.946 --> 00:02:16.401
That means, if this centre is alert and awakened, then we immediately know what is auspicious

00:02:16.482 --> 00:02:25.948
and what is not auspicious, or we can call it, we get the Divine Discretion.

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:43.624
I think it is a part of the genetics that people have discretion between good and bad,

00:02:44.105 --> 00:02:48.217
destructive and constructive.

00:02:48.885 --> 00:03:05.135
It is basically, has to be there, but we can easily spoil it by all these organs

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:14.220
which are collecting the conditionings and the ego from outside.

00:03:14.301 --> 00:03:18.424
That’s why this centre is very vulnerable.

00:03:18.424 --> 00:03:22.870
Other centres are not so much connected outside

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.448
as this centre is connected, and receives

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:31.132
all the information from, all these organs.

00:03:31.213 --> 00:03:35.136
For example, the eyes, now, we have.

00:03:35.217 --> 00:03:43.773
Eyes are very important because, they say it, this is the window of the Spirit.

00:03:43.854 --> 00:03:50.204
And you have seen that when Kundalini rises, and Spirit starts shining,

00:03:50.284 --> 00:03:54.943
there is a dilatation of the pupils and you look like an innocent child

00:03:55.023 --> 00:03:58.189
and there’s a twinkle in your eyes.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:07.253
But the way that we play with our eyes all the time, the way we use it indiscreetly

00:04:07.334 --> 00:04:15.913
with our lust and greed we can spoil this centre very badly.

00:04:16.023 --> 00:04:26.458
Once we start taking to destructive things in our life,

00:04:26.538 --> 00:04:34.868
we immediately become akin, or we start accepting,

00:04:34.948 --> 00:04:42.365
whatever is wrong, whatever is destructive, very easily.

00:04:42.446 --> 00:04:48.381
I feel this is some sort of a genetic defect because, in certain people,

00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:55.124
they will not accept anything that is stupid, idiotic or destructive.

00:04:55.304 --> 00:05:04.435
But in certain people they’re very prone and very easily can be taken to things which

00:05:04.435 --> 00:05:14.797
are absurd, which are stupid and which are definitely destructive.

00:05:14.878 --> 00:05:24.985
This can become a very collective acceptance also and once it becomes a collective acceptance,

00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:28.504
it starts penetrating throughout.

00:05:28.677 --> 00:05:34.935
It does not only have the effect of absorption, but also it has an effect

00:05:35.015 --> 00:05:37.745
of affecting other things.

00:05:37.826 --> 00:05:45.310
Say a person whose eyes are what we call flirtish or roving eyes,

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:49.231
such a person, if he goes to one group of people

00:05:49.311 --> 00:05:54.921
who do not know what flirting is, do not know what roving eyes is, with very steady eyes,

00:05:55.001 --> 00:06:05.985
he can influence those people and can make some of them of the same kind.

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:14.363
So what happens, really, is this, that, this is a very good door

00:06:14.443 --> 00:06:22.022
for all kinds of bhoots to enter, entities to enter,

00:06:22.102 --> 00:06:25.908
and when you start projecting it back,

00:06:25.988 --> 00:06:31.226
the same bhoots can pass into another person

00:06:31.306 --> 00:06:36.579
and can create the same kind of vacuum

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:46.371
or same kind of vulnerability in the Hamsa Chakra of other people.

00:06:48.994 --> 00:06:58.746
So that’s why eyes have to be very, very clean, innocent.

00:07:00.626 --> 00:07:05.555
Another, you can see, is what you hear.

00:07:05.636 --> 00:07:11.064
Some people, if they hear something nonsensical, they’ll just put their hands to their ears.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.914
They don’t want to hear anything.

00:07:14.995 --> 00:07:24.136
But there are some people who like it and go on enjoying it.

00:07:24.217 --> 00:07:29.843
Ultimately, they become servile or, we can say, conditioned,

00:07:29.923 --> 00:07:37.341
that they like all these
horrible things that normally a human being won’t like.

00:07:41.708 --> 00:07:47.529
Now, also you must have seen that people who, like French people,

00:07:47.609 --> 00:07:50.641
I think they have no discretion of smell.

00:07:50.722 --> 00:07:58.484
They smell so awful, but they eat all rotten food, rotten cheese, rotten,

00:07:58.564 --> 00:08:04.501
absolutely rotten wines, but they never smell it.

00:08:04.582 --> 00:08:06.662
Anybody in their company can smell it.

00:08:06.743 --> 00:08:10.805
Even their hands smell of their rotten cheese, you can’t just [bare to] smell it.

00:08:10.936 --> 00:08:13.415
But they have lost the power.

00:08:13.561 --> 00:08:17.746
In the same way, in our country we have a caste called sweepers

00:08:17.826 --> 00:08:23.267
who do all the cleaning of dirty things with their hands.

00:08:23.348 --> 00:08:27.131
They have no sense of smell.
They have lost the sense of smell.

00:08:27.264 --> 00:08:34.044
The nose has lost that smell sense. They cannot smell anything dirty.

00:08:34.125 --> 00:08:36.959
That’s how they can do their work.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:43.671
So if you start also not being alert to fragrance

00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:51.098
– I’ve seen also there are certain things people use made of tobacco,

00:08:51.178 --> 00:08:57.243
they are supposed to be very good, very famous

00:08:57.323 --> 00:09:04.340
brands of perfumes like ‘Tabac’ and all that.

00:09:04.421 --> 00:09:10.421
So once they start liking that kind of a thing, then they have other things like ‘Poison‘

00:09:10.502 --> 00:09:15.686
and other horrible things, which, it’s horrible smell in it.

00:09:15.767 --> 00:09:21.030
Apart from that, first [thing] you smell is alcohol, is a spirit!

00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:32.601
But they don’t mind because they see in that a very congenial type of a pleasure.

00:09:32.601 --> 00:09:37.516
But these pleasures, ultimately, can kill all the cells of the nose

00:09:37.596 --> 00:09:42.081
and afterwards one may even lose the sense of smell.

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:47.761
One of the joy-giving organ is the sense of smell.

00:09:47.842 --> 00:09:52.701
When the Kundalini rises in many people they get a fragrance of many things.

00:09:52.701 --> 00:10:00.181
Some people get of guggul or sometimes they get a fragrance of sandalwood or something,

00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:08.090
which is a very natural essence of flowers or maybe of some woods.

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:21.391
But these unnaturally made things which are actually destructive to your cells of smelling,

00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:27.061
that is what they start using, and once you start using these kind of things

00:10:27.141 --> 00:10:33.132
then what happens is that you don’t feel any bad smell anywhere, like animals.

00:10:33.213 --> 00:10:39.993
But so many animals can smell, if not they don’t call it bad or good, but they can smell.

00:10:40.074 --> 00:10:46.464
Even that sensitivity of good and bad smell which we human beings have got is lost.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:53.014
So whatever is our ascent, as human beings, at what a level we have gone,

00:10:53.094 --> 00:10:59.291
start completely disappearing, gradually, one by one.

00:11:00.138 --> 00:11:03.147
Then same with the throat.

00:11:03.228 --> 00:11:21.034
If the throat is using bad languages and is being used for abusing people,

00:11:21.114 --> 00:11:28.090
showing temper on people or anything of aggression

00:11:28.183 --> 00:11:36.035
or sometimes people take things which can also spoil the throat

00:11:36.116 --> 00:11:47.553
by their destructive qualities, like alcohol; specially the smoking.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:55.925
If you smoke then the throat gets vulnerable and the sweetness of your voice is lost.

00:11:56.006 --> 00:11:58.931
Then they speak with a hoarse voice.

00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:02.230
But this is all external.

00:12:02.311 --> 00:12:05.449
It starts becoming external.

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:15.821
Mouth smells with that and also the teeth react to all such things, which we take

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:19.751
without discretion about it, because that’s the fashion,

00:12:19.831 --> 00:12:24.440
because it is marketing well, because it is advertised!

00:12:24.521 --> 00:12:30.730
That means we have not got our own wisdom, our own personality.

00:12:30.811 --> 00:12:40.651
But when this centre is awakened, then what you develop is a discretion.

00:12:40.732 --> 00:12:48.801
As I was telling them yesterday how the word Hamsa has come for this centre.

00:12:48.901 --> 00:12:56.744
Because there’s a Sanskrit, very beautiful, couplet, which says that a swan is white

00:12:56.825 --> 00:13:00.071
and a crane is a white bird.

00:13:00.071 --> 00:13:07.031
What is the difference between the swan and a crane?

00:13:07.112 --> 00:13:14.831
The answer is that when you mix milk with water, the swan will just suck in the milk

00:13:15.292 --> 00:13:21.068
while the crane has no discretion, no vivek.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:33.169
This discretionary power, once we start losing, we start becoming

00:13:33.249 --> 00:13:38.974
just like robots, I would say, because we have no personality.

00:13:39.087 --> 00:13:46.957
Anybody can brainwash us and the more they tell us about our discretion we listen to them.

00:13:47.038 --> 00:13:53.189
That explains why people, so many thousands of people, go to all these false gurus.

00:13:53.417 --> 00:13:59.487
Thousands of people, why did they take to homosexuality and got into AIDS?

00:13:59.792 --> 00:14:06.139
Why thousands of people have taken to drugs?

00:14:08.781 --> 00:14:13.641
It is unbelievable! Incredible!

00:14:13.641 --> 00:14:18.251
Why people have taken to all these things [and] are destroying their life.

00:14:18.349 --> 00:14:22.762
They see a man going into the pub, coming out and falling down

00:14:22.842 --> 00:14:26.441
on the ground with all his purse being emptied.

00:14:26.522 --> 00:14:31.210
But they go with the purse, see that they have sufficient money to go inside the pub,

00:14:31.304 --> 00:14:36.952
again come out to fall down on the street.

00:14:37.649 --> 00:14:44.821
Whatever idiotic or nonsensical [things] other people are doing, when you see they’re idiotic,

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:48.941
you pay money to become idiotic.

00:14:49.022 --> 00:14:56.804
One pays money to destroy oneself, go out of the way.

00:14:56.885 --> 00:14:59.891
It is so unnatural for anyone.

00:15:00.418 --> 00:15:06.438
I mean even a dog or a cat, or any animal, knows where is the danger is.

00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:14.562
They can smell the danger and they run away because they have to preserve their lives.

00:15:14.643 --> 00:15:19.660
They think their lives are precious and they must live and live well.

00:15:19.741 --> 00:15:27.731
But this ordinary, common sense starts missing and they will say, “What’s wrong?

00:15:27.934 --> 00:15:32.441
What’s wrong in this?
What’s wrong in that?”

00:15:32.441 --> 00:15:38.710
That means the genetics of the Hamsa are missing.

00:15:38.791 --> 00:15:44.741
Now you should see there is no Deity on the Hamsa Chakra,

00:15:44.821 --> 00:15:57.539
but it is the formless energy of so many organs

00:15:57.619 --> 00:16:10.344
which are looked after by Buddha, Mahavira, Christ, Shri Krishna

00:16:10.425 --> 00:16:16.331
– four of them, managed by Shri Ganesha.

00:16:16.412 --> 00:16:23.201
So these genetics are put by Shri Ganesha because He is the source of the Wisdom.

00:16:23.201 --> 00:16:32.471
So first, once they spoil their Mooladhara, the wisdom is finished:

00:16:32.551 --> 00:16:36.636
[the] basis, the fundamentals, are finished.

00:16:36.717 --> 00:16:42.939
That’s why immoral life is very detrimental to our life

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:51.881
because we lose our discretion, the discretion is lost.

00:16:53.794 --> 00:17:02.560
Then if you can awaken Shri Ganesha in the Hamsa Chakra,

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:11.234
then suddenly you belong to the higher race of Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:12.295 --> 00:17:17.555
It’s surprising. I’ve seen people overnight give up their drugs,

00:17:17.635 --> 00:17:21.650
very immoral people become extremely moral

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:26.298
because of this chakra being suddenly awakened

00:17:26.391 --> 00:17:31.661
and the light of the Spirit is best expressed

00:17:31.741 --> 00:17:40.837
through this chakra in everyday life, in the collective life also.

00:17:41.558 --> 00:17:46.233
So all these things that we have gathered from our previous life,

00:17:46.314 --> 00:17:51.286
even after our second birth we carry little bit.
Like an egg becomes a bird

00:17:51.367 --> 00:17:58.249
but still lots of things of the egg are hanging on to his body, so you have to cleanse it.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:03.533
So, at this point, when you have got your realisation, the first discretion should be,

00:18:03.614 --> 00:18:09.808
“How am I going to achieve that state of Spirit?”

00:18:09.808 --> 00:18:11.780
The Pure Spirit!
