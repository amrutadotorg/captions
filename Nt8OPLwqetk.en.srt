1
00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:06,918
I’m sorry I’ve not been able to speak 
to you in English language

2
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:12,598
- and I’ve spoken some time. This special 
day today is the day of Sankrant.

3
00:00:12,623 --> 00:00:18,813
Sankr – you know ‘San’ means good, 
holy, and ‘krant’ means the –

4
00:00:18,838 --> 00:00:23,237
(A yogi says in a low voice: “Revolution”. 
Shri Mataji says some words in marathi)

5
00:00:23,262 --> 00:00:26,249
When I speak Marathi I forget English – 
Yogis: Revolution.

6
00:00:26,274 --> 00:00:30,982
Shri Mataji: Revolution. 
Holy revolution. Holy.

7
00:00:31,007 --> 00:00:34,361
And that’s what I’m telling them,

8
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:39,660
what is the Holy Revolution is, that your 
own Dharma is established

9
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:42,399
now through Sahaja Yoga. You know 
what is your Dharma.

10
00:00:42,424 --> 00:00:45,025
Because if you don’t do your own 
Dharmas

11
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,699
you’ll be lost. Your vibrations will 
be lost.

12
00:00:47,724 --> 00:00:52,463
You’ll immediately know that in your 
seeking you have lost something.

13
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:59,311
You’ll be affected and so you have 
to correct. That’s not so difficult.

14
00:00:59,336 --> 00:01:06,563
But to make it a Sankranta – the Holy 
Revolution – you have to take to new

15
00:01:07,262 --> 00:01:13,429
– new religion, new steps. First of all, 
your own step should be enlightened,

16
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:18,394
and then you have to establish new steps 
to go ahead.

17
00:01:18,419 --> 00:01:21,816
And these are the new steps which 
are different

18
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:25,457
for the Westerners and different 
for the Easterners.

19
00:01:25,482 --> 00:01:31,165
Just now I told them about the Eastern 
style and then I’ll tell you later on

20
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:37,383
about the Western. We have to have 
new ideals,

21
00:01:37,408 --> 00:01:45,689
new styles because we are the courageous 
people, we are the valiant people.

22
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:52,751
We have to fight the war of love, 
through love.

23
00:01:54,154 --> 00:02:01,345
And it’s a very delicate thing. When 
the moon moves – the sun moves –

24
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:08,992
from the left to the right that means 
your desire becomes your action.

25
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:13,517
Today is the day they give you a sweet 
thing to say that

26
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:21,241
you must speak sweetly which is very 
important for Western people;

27
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:28,153
that when you are doing and organizing 
you become heated up,

28
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:34,507
there’s tension and you develop the 
temperament which is dry, emotionless.

29
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:38,504
You know the heart goes into a tantrum.

30
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:43,773
At that time they say that you take 
the sweet.This sweet is a heating thing

31
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:51,678
because now the sun is moving towards 
the other side.

32
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:56,107
That time also they, to give it a balance, 
they say: “Speak very sweetly.

33
00:02:56,132 --> 00:03:00,183
Use sweet words, use sweetness.

34
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:04,721
Bring sweetness in your language.” 
- Which is very important,

35
00:03:04,746 --> 00:03:09,541
you understand that. And this is one 
of the religions we have to accept

36
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:17,059
that we will not use harsh words to each 
other and then later on to others.

37
00:03:17,084 --> 00:03:20,413
First of all to each other. There are many 
people who will be kind to others

38
00:03:20,438 --> 00:03:24,608
because others will eat them off but 
unkind to their own sahaja yogis.

39
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:31,474
Because it is a universal happening. It’s 
the whole thing is working out universally.

40
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:36,054
Even if you organize, you organize 
for the whole.

41
00:03:37,282 --> 00:03:42,960
Those who are organizing have no business 
to be harsh

42
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:48,332
and those who are not organizing has 
no business to be slow.

43
00:03:48,357 --> 00:03:53,018
We must move with the same speed, 
with the same understanding.

44
00:03:53,043 --> 00:04:00,012
There’s a story in Marathi language 
which is a very good story that a –

45
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:08,970
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi] 
- the bird-catcher had put lots of

46
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:15,955
temptations of good grain for some birds 
– pigeons

47
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:23,166
and the pigeons didn’t see the nest [net] 
– the trap -

48
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:30,353
and they all came down to eat that. 
And there was a net there.

49
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:36,138
In the net their feet were entangled.

50
00:04:36,791 --> 00:04:43,885
So the solution was found out that: 
‘If all of us with the same speed

51
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:53,560
take off, we’ll take away the whole 
of the net and then he cannot catch us.’

52
00:04:54,318 --> 00:04:56,891
So, one person said: ‘Alright, as soon 
as I say ‘yes’,

53
00:04:56,916 --> 00:04:59,634
let us all start with the same speed.

54
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:04,338
If somebody increases his speed 
he is brought down.

55
00:05:05,184 --> 00:05:09,098
In the same way Sahaja Yoga has to be 
worked out;

56
00:05:09,123 --> 00:05:14,224
and that’s why to keep up the speed 
keep yourself

57
00:05:14,249 --> 00:05:19,438
peaceful, loving, affectionate.

58
00:05:19,463 --> 00:05:22,992
Peace is the way we are going 
to achieve it.

59
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:27,395
This is an explosive peace.

60
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:32,845
By giving contrasts you bring the balance 
in: explosive.

61
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,112
You have read also about the Goddess 
– the different aspects of Goddess.

62
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:40,878
Always: ‘Ati saumya, Ati Raudra’ [gentle 
like the Moon and terrible like Rudra]

63
00:05:40,903 --> 00:05:46,471
To give the two contrasts by which bring 
the balance in the middle.

64
00:05:46,496 --> 00:05:54,865
That’s how you must understand that 
Sahaja Yoga is a very unique revolution.

65
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,768
I told them also politically and also 
socially – in every way

66
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:04,715
how we are going to improve every 
country.

67
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,764
Thus the whole world – the whole universe.

68
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:14,156
Later on I’ll translate the whole thing 
for you.

69
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:18,821
So today’s special day, very great day,

70
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:25,627
let us ask that – when you are doing 
this Puja,

71
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:33,660
ask for new religions within you to be 
enshrined,

72
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:40,505
to be sustained within ourselves and try 
to imbibe them.

73
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,792
They will be permeating but you have 
to accept them;

74
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:47,837
and [you] should know it’s a big fight;

75
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:53,475
and it’s a very different type of a fight 
of peace and love.

76
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,460
That’s why they say: ‘Speak sweetly. 
Be sweet with others.

77
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:08,001
Not to be sarcastic by any chance, 
nor to be harsh, but be sweet.

78
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:13,212
Sweetness which is genuine, not outward 
and showing and formal,

79
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:17,793
but genuine sweetness. 
May God bless you all.
