1
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:23,496
[Talk in Marathi for the first
14 minutes, then in English]

2
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:49,196
We have come to this place many a times,

3
00:14:49,397 --> 00:14:51,164
this beautiful place, you all like it.

4
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:54,946
It’s very rustic, absolutely in
the interior.

5
00:14:55,147 --> 00:14:59,247
Only thing is, coming all the way from
Ganapatipule,

6
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:02,631
you have to spend lot of time.

7
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:12,153
All this you are doing just to enjoy
the beauty of nature,

8
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,966
and to be with the nature.

9
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:23,920
I have told you already that this fruit
of coconut is called as Shriphala,

10
00:15:24,121 --> 00:15:27,959
because it is the Sahasrara,

11
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,332
and it’s very surprising

12
00:15:31,532 --> 00:15:34,468
that this fruit knows and understands.

13
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:39,751
It won’t fall on any animal or on any
person.

14
00:15:39,952 --> 00:15:42,739
If you are sleeping here, it will never
fall on you.

15
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:46,392
Nobody is hurt, ever, by this fruit.

16
00:15:46,593 --> 00:15:50,484
It is so sensible, more than human beings,

17
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:53,710
because we do hurt others, we do trouble
others,

18
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,826
we don’t think what we are doing.

19
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:03,207
But in Sahaja Yoga there’s lot of
sweetness, goodness, righteousness,

20
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:06,838
and it’s so encouraging.

21
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,139
Also so many people are there, newly
married.

22
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,197
I congratulate them, all of them.

23
00:16:13,398 --> 00:16:16,253
Now try to be...

24
00:16:20,692 --> 00:16:22,737
Try to be kind to each other.

25
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:26,438
If you are reserved in the beginning,
you’ll have to pay for it.

26
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:30,570
Please try to be nice, kind and talkative;

27
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:36,574
not that you just keep quiet and don’t
talk to someone.

28
00:16:36,781 --> 00:16:41,605
Maybe there’s sort of a way of impressing
others:

29
00:16:41,805 --> 00:16:43,992
not in our Sahaja Yoga.

30
00:16:44,193 --> 00:16:47,814
In Sahaja Yoga I talk too much, that’s why
My throat is off today,

31
00:16:48,015 --> 00:16:50,340
and you also talk.

32
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:55,947
Talking is very important, not hiding your
feelings.

33
00:16:56,148 --> 00:17:00,306
I have told lots of things about it, how
to make a marriage happy,

34
00:17:00,507 --> 00:17:02,732
that will make [you] very happy also.

35
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:07,420
If you have very good marriages we’ll have
very good children born to you,

36
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:12,801
and then we’ll have a new race of people
in this world.

37
00:17:13,002 --> 00:17:16,416
These children will be the most powerful
things for us,

38
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:18,372
and they’ll work out many things

39
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:21,494
which we could not work out.

40
00:17:29,668 --> 00:17:35,415
Regarding our tour, I hope you have been
happy about it,

41
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:39,824
and then you enjoyed all the programs
that we had.

42
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:54,656
Today I am going to tell you something
about the sea,

43
00:17:54,857 --> 00:17:56,899
because we are next to the sea here,

44
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,291
and must understand the feelings of a sea.

45
00:18:01,491 --> 00:18:04,089
Sea is your grandfather in a way,

46
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:12,109
because he gave birth to Lakshmi, who
becomes Mahalakshmi later on.

47
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:19,394
So this sea which is the grandfather, we
have to show all respect to him.

48
00:18:19,594 --> 00:18:28,765
Normally the way people are living, in
the West specially, also in India,

49
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:34,035
people go and use it for bathrooms.

50
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:37,700
But also in the West they use it in a very
funny way,

51
00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:43,372
that they use it for swimming and all kinds
of things,

52
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,355
by which they wear funny dresses

53
00:18:46,556 --> 00:18:50,801
and lead a very licentious life.

54
00:18:51,002 --> 00:18:53,712
This is an insult to the sea.

55
00:18:53,913 --> 00:18:58,516
We must respect the sea. In India we
worship the sea.

56
00:18:58,735 --> 00:19:02,716
We have to worship the sea. And in
the Greek mythology also

57
00:19:02,917 --> 00:19:08,467
they had a, as we have Varuna, they too had
a God for sea.

58
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:12,912
So this God for sea has to be worshipped,

59
00:19:13,113 --> 00:19:17,103
and has to be understood and to be
respected.

60
00:19:17,304 --> 00:19:18,979
We cannot be disrespectful.

61
00:19:19,187 --> 00:19:22,898
Before entering into sea you must say
namaskar to the sea,

62
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:27,235
and coming out of it also you must say
namaskar.

63
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:33,454
The way we behave towards the sea is not
proper.

64
00:19:33,655 --> 00:19:37,586
As you know, because of sea we get rain.

65
00:19:37,787 --> 00:19:42,419
If there was no sea we would not have
rain, we would not have anything.

66
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,855
Sea is so important to our life.

67
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:48,207
The greatest thing is, sea is the Guru,

68
00:19:48,408 --> 00:19:53,188
is the Mahaguru which teaches us so many
things.

69
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:59,433
First of all, this Mahaguru is the one,
creates salt for us.

70
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:05,713
Christ has said: “You are the salt, salt
of the universe”;

71
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:10,129
meaning, you are the one which gives taste

72
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:14,018
and all the qualities of the salt to
the human beings.

73
00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:18,070
So this sea is there, we have to learn
a lot from this sea.

74
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:22,575
The first of all is that it has its own
maryadas.

75
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:26,781
Supposing you try to press the sea from
this side,

76
00:20:26,982 --> 00:20:29,061
it will appear on the other side.

77
00:20:29,268 --> 00:20:31,410
It always keeps to its maryadas.

78
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:35,763
Such a huge thing are these oceans –
are such huge,

79
00:20:35,963 --> 00:20:37,725
but they keep to their maryadas,

80
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:41,450
they never cross their maryadas.

81
00:20:41,744 --> 00:20:49,051
While we just start encroaching on
everybody’s maryadas.

82
00:20:49,418 --> 00:20:52,038
So the maryadas of the sea is very
important –

83
00:20:52,255 --> 00:20:57,036
that it just keeps to its own line.

84
00:20:57,237 --> 00:21:00,556
You can draw the line when it is a high
tide,

85
00:21:00,757 --> 00:21:02,872
next day, whenever there will be a high
tide,

86
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:05,791
it will be just there.

87
00:21:06,422 --> 00:21:09,569
So imagine such a huge thing like an ocean

88
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:14,257
can keep itself to the same maryadas,

89
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:17,783
why can’t we, with such a personality
of ours,

90
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:22,782
should keep to ourselves and to our
maryadas?

91
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:28,250
Then the second quality of the sea is that
it looks after

92
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,515
all the animals that are in it.

93
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:35,618
Somehow it is a saltish thing, but there
are fishes

94
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:40,987
and there are all kinds of animals which
exist in the sea,

95
00:21:41,188 --> 00:21:43,714
and that’s why it is, we should say,

96
00:21:43,915 --> 00:21:48,111
the first life came into being in the sea.

97
00:21:48,312 --> 00:21:51,650
So all our forefathers, long time back,

98
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:53,641
must have been born in the sea,

99
00:21:53,842 --> 00:21:56,596
and then we, now we have become human
beings.

100
00:21:56,797 --> 00:21:59,630
So we have no right to insult the sea,

101
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:02,968
where our forefathers must have existed

102
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:05,947
and then they started coming out, one
by one

103
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:11,492
as the fish came, as a reptile.

104
00:22:13,953 --> 00:22:21,952
Now the third quality of the sea is that
it is a deep thing,

105
00:22:22,152 --> 00:22:26,989
it is very deep. In some places is
extremely deep.

106
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,823
If the depth of the sea is reduced

107
00:22:31,023 --> 00:22:39,118
even by few, few feet, there will be
problem all over.

108
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:42,329
It keeps to its depth. It doesn’t leave
its depth.

109
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:46,783
It keeps to its maryadas, and it keeps
to its depth.

110
00:22:46,984 --> 00:22:49,271
In the same way, whatever depth we have got

111
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:51,836
in Sahaja Yoga, we should keep to that.

112
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:56,639
Normally we should not become cheap type
people,

113
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,285
we cannot afford. We have to be deep people

114
00:23:00,485 --> 00:23:02,693
with deep understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

115
00:23:02,893 --> 00:23:04,789
deep understanding of ourselves,

116
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,990
because that’s the sign of dignity.

117
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,393
And that dignity you must have,

118
00:23:09,594 --> 00:23:13,802
that majestic nature of the sea you must
have.

119
00:23:14,003 --> 00:23:17,959
Now these trees as they are you see, are
very surprisingly,

120
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,979
they are getting all the wind from the sea.

121
00:23:23,186 --> 00:23:25,910
But if you go nearer the sea when they are
planted,

122
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,017
they all bend towards the sea, never away.

123
00:23:30,217 --> 00:23:36,277
They give their, sort of, gratitude by
bending towards the sea.

124
00:23:36,478 --> 00:23:38,828
Though the wind is blowing the other way
round,

125
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:40,610
but they’re not bothered about the wind.

126
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:44,702
Their gratitude is to the sea, so they bend
towards the sea.

127
00:23:44,902 --> 00:23:49,557
Even these trees understand what it is
like.

128
00:23:49,812 --> 00:23:52,707
Without the sea we could not have had
any transport

129
00:23:52,908 --> 00:23:55,313
from places to places as we have been,

130
00:23:55,513 --> 00:24:01,731
and also there is a great lot of wealth
inside the bed of the sea

131
00:24:01,932 --> 00:24:04,254
which is not yet explored; but once
explored,

132
00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:06,199
the whole world can be very rich.

133
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,529
But they are fighting about it, which part
is ours,

134
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,333
which part is yours; that in that fight do
you know, I think

135
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:18,687
all this inside the sea might shift from
one place to another!

136
00:24:18,887 --> 00:24:22,781
And lots of wealth which is of…

137
00:24:22,981 --> 00:24:28,156
which is like gold, silver, diamonds, are
all embedded in the sea.

138
00:24:28,357 --> 00:24:32,193
And one day may be that this Lakshmi might
be discovered,

139
00:24:32,393 --> 00:24:36,507
and we people will be enriched all over.

140
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:40,034
Moreover when we carry the transport,

141
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:44,456
we carry Lakshmi from one place to another,
from another place to this place,

142
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:49,132
so the sea has given us that mobility and
movement.

143
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:55,311
I have seen the sea reacts to Me very much.

144
00:24:55,512 --> 00:24:59,272
It reacts, because if there’s a light

145
00:24:59,473 --> 00:25:04,657
in the sea, or a moon, sun in the - moon
in the sea reflecting,

146
00:25:04,857 --> 00:25:07,724
it moves with Me, I’ve seen it, it moves
with Me.

147
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:10,590
The sea understands Me very well,

148
00:25:10,791 --> 00:25:15,916
because I have a special relationship and
a respect for that sea.

149
00:25:16,117 --> 00:25:20,909
Now when you are here, I hope you’ll
understand the value of the sea.

150
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,479
Because of the sea you are so much enjoying
here,

151
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,982
it is giving you such good feelings, and
all spirituality.

152
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:33,503
There is no need to go to Himalayas.

153
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,862
The – whatever is covering is in
the Himalayas,

154
00:25:38,062 --> 00:25:42,355
is what is nothing but the water from
the sea only.

155
00:25:42,556 --> 00:25:47,805
It’s one of the circles, that water passes
to the Himalayas,

156
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:52,068
then comes back as rivers, again falls into
the same sea.

157
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:57,853
They have to come to the sea. So it is
everything ends up here.

158
00:25:58,054 --> 00:26:02,972
And then it is allowed – it goes through
tapasya – it allows the Sun

159
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:11,508
to create that cloud by suffering the heat,

160
00:26:11,708 --> 00:26:15,091
heat of the Sun, and becomes vapours,

161
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:20,296
and then it goes as clouds and you get your
rain.

162
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:23,403
In the same way we have to be;

163
00:26:23,603 --> 00:26:27,312
we have to bear the heat of others,

164
00:26:27,512 --> 00:26:31,507
the anger of others and create vapours –

165
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:34,543
means the blessings, the vibrations for
others.

166
00:26:34,743 --> 00:26:36,972
It is with Me, same thing.

167
00:26:37,173 --> 00:26:40,405
When I see somebody who is sick and I
treat him,

168
00:26:40,606 --> 00:26:45,127
of course I have to bear a little bit,
sometimes quite a lot,

169
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,887
then I absorb it and then they become
vibrations.

170
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:51,332
They just start flowing as vibrations.

171
00:26:51,532 --> 00:26:53,503
So this is what you have to learn from
the sea,

172
00:26:53,704 --> 00:26:56,159
which is very important for sahaja yogis,

173
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,922
that you absorb everything, doesn’t matter.

174
00:26:59,123 --> 00:27:02,330
But don’t get attached to it, and let it
become vapours,

175
00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:08,686
and the Sea can now become the vapours.

176
00:27:08,886 --> 00:27:11,615
As you all are here, all these vapours

177
00:27:11,815 --> 00:27:14,205
as vibrations should flow.

178
00:27:14,405 --> 00:27:18,116
This method you should try to understand
by courage.

179
00:27:18,316 --> 00:27:21,079
Because the other day when I was coming,
there was a lady sitting

180
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,580
just on the way: “Mother, her feet

181
00:27:23,781 --> 00:27:28,460
are out of order, or something gone wrong.
Please treat her.”

182
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,057
Why should I treat? Why can’t you treat?

183
00:27:31,258 --> 00:27:34,306
Are you afraid to treat someone?

184
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:37,555
Then there’s another one who comes up
to say: “Mother, You treat her.”

185
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,149
Why can’t you treat?

186
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,938
You all can treat them, you can help them,

187
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:47,784
and you’ll be surprised, the more you’ll
treat them the better you will be.

188
00:27:47,985 --> 00:27:52,292
You should venture, you should have that
much courage to treat others.

189
00:27:52,493 --> 00:27:56,899
If you don’t treat others you won’t grow

190
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:00,891
because that is what, like the sea, as you
have seen,

191
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:07,253
you become the vibrations. And when you
treat others there are more vibrations.

192
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:09,248
Why should God give you vibrations

193
00:28:09,448 --> 00:28:13,649
if you are not going to use it? Simple
logic.

194
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,712
Why should God give you light if you are
not going to use it?

195
00:28:18,912 --> 00:28:24,943
Christ has said that, “You don’t put light
under a measure.”

196
00:28:25,714 --> 00:28:30,140
That’s what we are doing when we are not
using our hands,

197
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,959
our feet, our brains for Sahaja Yoga:

198
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,909
we are not creating vibrations within
ourselves.

199
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:41,168
The same body that is yours can just become
a bundle of vibrations,

200
00:28:41,369 --> 00:28:44,790
if you start using these vibrations.

201
00:28:45,513 --> 00:28:48,863
But if you don’t use these vibrations
you’ll have problems

202
00:28:49,071 --> 00:28:52,044
problems all the time, and you will not
understand:

203
00:28:52,244 --> 00:28:54,663
“Why? I am doing everything, I am doing
this” –

204
00:28:54,864 --> 00:28:57,637
because you are not using your vibrations.

205
00:28:57,838 --> 00:29:01,758
You have to use your vibrations in every
way possible,

206
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:05,071
whenever is possible, to help others

207
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,621
to get all right, to get well.

208
00:29:10,725 --> 00:29:12,588
You can at the most take a bandhan if you
like,

209
00:29:12,788 --> 00:29:15,209
if you think that it might hurt you or
something,

210
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:17,655
but at least use My photograph.

211
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:21,442
And after the photograph you can just touch
the person, there’s no harm.

212
00:29:21,643 --> 00:29:27,866
After all, if you are afraid even of any
troubles,

213
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:31,497
then what’s the use of becoming a sahaja
yogi?

214
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:37,052
If the ship is not seaworthy, what’s
the use of making a ship?

215
00:29:37,252 --> 00:29:40,141
You have to be seaworthy.

216
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:45,999
And that’s what you have to decide, that:
“We are going to be Sahaja Yoga worthy,

217
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:49,572
and for that we are going to absorb all
the vibrations,

218
00:29:49,773 --> 00:29:52,474
we are going to take up everything upon
ourselves.”

219
00:29:52,681 --> 00:29:55,777
Little trouble also they have, they’ll tell
Me ten times:

220
00:29:55,986 --> 00:29:57,957
“We went there, then this happened,

221
00:29:58,157 --> 00:30:00,393
then that happened, then this.”

222
00:30:00,594 --> 00:30:03,598
But I never tell you anything, what happens
to Me,

223
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:07,426
how I came here, what was there; nothing!

224
00:30:07,642 --> 00:30:10,633
Because I know that all this is, whatever
I am doing,

225
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:14,872
is created into vibrations. In the same way
have faith,

226
00:30:15,073 --> 00:30:19,328
that you are all just like the sea, like
the Mahaguru,

227
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:24,254
and that whatever you are doing is creating
vibrations within you,

228
00:30:24,454 --> 00:30:28,170
by which you can save so many.

229
00:30:29,235 --> 00:30:31,967
It’s something like a cycle again, I said,

230
00:30:32,168 --> 00:30:35,282
that the more you give, the more you get.

231
00:30:35,483 --> 00:30:40,254
The more you use your vibrations, much more
you’ll get it.

232
00:30:40,455 --> 00:30:47,014
It’s a very nice cycle that is acting as it
has acted in the case of the sea,

233
00:30:47,215 --> 00:30:50,689
as I told you, that the water goes
to the Himalayas,

234
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,222
comes back at rivers. In the same way

235
00:30:54,423 --> 00:30:59,624
manifold, manifold your vibrations will be
growing,

236
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:04,365
and I would say that we should always use
our vibrations

237
00:31:04,565 --> 00:31:10,917
for helping others, for giving to many
things, to the plant, to the anything.

238
00:31:11,124 --> 00:31:12,979
I mean there were some people who brought
a plant:

239
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:17,682
“Mother, give vibrations to that.” I said:
“Why don’t you give the vibrations?”

240
00:31:17,883 --> 00:31:19,811
There’s no need even to take vibrated
water.

241
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:23,367
You can vibrate yourself. That state has
to come,

242
00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:26,008
that you can vibrate your own water,

243
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,062
you can vibrate the whole waters
everywhere,

244
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:30,440
there’s no need to take vibrated water
from Me.

245
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:35,187
Maybe Mine is a little more, but doesn’t
matter!

246
00:31:43,314 --> 00:31:47,564
But you are so many, so what – compared
to Me, I’m only one.

247
00:31:47,765 --> 00:31:50,569
So all of you can work it out and do such
a lot;

248
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,125
but have faith in yourself.

249
00:31:53,326 --> 00:31:55,019
As the sea has faith in itself,

250
00:31:55,219 --> 00:31:57,545
you should have complete faith in yourself.

251
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,732
You must respect your Self Realization.

252
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:04,758
Tell every day to yourself: “I am a sahaja
yogi.

253
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:07,396
I am a yogi, I am a saint,

254
00:32:07,597 --> 00:32:11,791
I am a realised soul. I have to do this.

255
00:32:11,991 --> 00:32:15,994
How can I do these other nonsensical
things? I have to do these good things.

256
00:32:16,194 --> 00:32:18,994
I have to talk to people in a sweet manner,

257
00:32:19,195 --> 00:32:23,509
I have to try to work it out this way.”

258
00:32:24,272 --> 00:32:31,890
It is actually your faith in yourself is
going to help.

259
00:32:32,091 --> 00:32:35,078
Your faith in yourself – that you are
a great sahaja yogi,

260
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:40,751
that you are absolutely surrendered to your
Mother, works very fast.

261
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,736
That faith you should have, that you are
a sahaja yogi.

262
00:32:43,937 --> 00:32:46,375
Nothing else is needed.

263
00:32:46,576 --> 00:32:49,051
May God bless you all.
