00:00:04.114 --> 00:00:08.480
Gregoire has said so many things that I
really don’t know what to say after that.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.800
Really dumbfounded.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:29.840
I know it’s a fact and you have to
face it, though I’m bashful about it.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:47.040
You were all seeking, and I think from the time I
remember I haven’t met anyone who was not seeking.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:57.840
They may be seeking in money, in power.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.960
But so many of them were really
seeking something beyond.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.360
In the West, I always felt

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:18.400
all the great sages of the old and the
ancient times who were seeking God, are born.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.840
I could see, the way you
have abhorred materialism;

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:36.480
the way you have achieved a kind of a
understanding about life… is new thing.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.120
At the time of Christ it was
not possible to see such people

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.080
except for some lepers and some sickly people.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.520
There was nobody else who
was willing to look at Him.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.840
Times have changed no doubt.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.720
But, in this seeking, many people
have committed lots of mistakes.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.840
Mistakes can be forgiven always.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.040
They should be rectified.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.200
I’ve been born with this.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.760
I knew I had to do this and I knew
I had to be in London one day.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.000
All the people who are of a very
high, evolved status, I can say,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:39.280
who do not live in the humdrum of life, who
do not roam about as gurus and earn money,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.520
who do not claim to be pundits and
the temples’ and the priest people,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.080
those who live away from all of you,
hiding themselves in the jungles,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.960
they knew it was to happen.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.000
They knew about it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:17.840
But when the seeking started in the
West, like a demand the supply came in.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.160
We have so many Sahaja Yogis here sitting down.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.080
I would say they are real
seekers because they reunite to fight.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.640
not clear – “denied” sounds
like “renite”], defied.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.920
There few things, you can make it out
very easily when we have, before us,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.120
the life of Christ, by which you can make
out who is the true person and who is not.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.920
It’s not difficult.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:54.000
For example, a person who takes money from you,
cannot be, cannot be a person who belongs to God.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.120
Person who belongs to God doesn’t
think much of money or anything.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.920
If he’s rich, he lives like a rich person.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.000
If he’s poor, he lives like a poor
person; but at heart he’s a king.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.840
Christ was a son of a carpenter.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.120
I see His pictures and I see His
Mother’s pictures adorned with jewellery.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.840
She had only two robes to change.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.520
Perhaps it was never realized
that money cannot purchase God.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.520
In the name of God and religion
things have gone so far, so far

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:53.360
that I do not blame human beings for
taking to science, instead of God.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.760
The misinterpretation has been
so much, one can understand.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:06.680
But when there are so many false
things in the world – copies –

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.280
then one must know that there
must be something… absolute.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.920
Has to be.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.960
London is regarded by all those I
have been describing about, the people

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.800
who are great sages, all
over the world, as the heart.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.000
It saddens Me to see sometimes how

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.840
people of England have not realized
the value of this great country.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.840
In this country, long time, much before,

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.400
much before even Christ came in,
people have worked with Kundalini.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:06.640
Your Stonehenge is nothing but the Kundalini.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.040
Vibrations have worked in
this country for ages now.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.640
Only I am here to introduce you to them.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.360
There is some gentleman I saw
copying this Kundalini that

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:29.040
we have already made for you, all the
drawings and everything, for you to see and

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.560
to understand where are, what are the
chakras and what are the deities ruling them.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.920
You should not accept Me even when Gregoire
has told you all about these things.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.280
Could be wrong.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.960
No blind faith is going to lead
you to reality, not at all.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.960
By saying “Just believe me”, is a wrong style.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:54.560
You should not.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.040
But you should not also deny Me.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.040
Keep it open.

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:08.080
For you are seeking and if
I have to just enlighten you

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.000
because you should enlighten other
people, one should not feel hurt about it.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.400
Somebody has to do it.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.960
You may be in this place
or I may be in your place.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:21.840
Makes no difference.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:33.120
If there’s a candle, which is enlightened, which
can enlighten other lights if they are ready,

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.080
then it’s, maybe,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.160
that I may be knowing all the tricks of the trade.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.320
I may be having all the knowledge about it.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.240
It may be worth it to know
all about that.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.520
Let us not be very serious about it, just
because Gregoire has struck such a serious note.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.640
It’s just a play.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.160
It’s just a play.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.040
It’s not that serious as we think it to be.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.920
It has to be a play because it is so important.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.840
All those things that are important are
easiest for us – example: our breathing.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:28.640
Supposing for learning how to breathe, if
you have to go to Caxton Hall in the rain,

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:34.000
walk all the way, listen to a big lecture
and then learn about it, you’d be finished.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:44.640
In the same way if we have to get our realization
by standing on our heads or by renouncing the

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.720
whole world or, I don’t know, dancing on
the Oxford Street and all sorts of things,

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.840
then God save all the people who are seeking.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.920
It has to be extremely simple –

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:09.200
has to work out that way – because if evolution
is complete, we would not have been in confusion.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.040
It is not complete, that’s why we are confused.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:23.600
‘Til the animal stage, there is
no question of thinking about it.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.160
Only when you become human beings
you start thinking about it.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.760
Only at the human stage you are
given freedom to think about it.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.920
Animals are in collective consciousness all the
time – in the sense they are not conscious of it,

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.120
but they are driven by it.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.360
[pause in recording, Shri Mataji
seems to be referring to a book]

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.280
…that the whole nature works in such a manner

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:54.960
as if there are some organizer which are arranging
their coordination, their harmony, their working.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:02.640
Not only that but the death of one
thing helps to give life to another.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:09.440
For example, in the nature the leaves have to fall
down to the ground to give nitrogen to the ground.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:17.840
Again, to be again renovated, say… you
can say, regenerated into the body of the

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.800
tree to come again into its
new foliage and to its bloom.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:35.760
All kinds of… we can say, real
experiments he [the author] has given;

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:42.320
but if you now go and read it you will know
he’s just talking about the collective be-ing,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:50.720
the mass be-ing that is there, the one in which we
all exist as Self, and that He is looking after

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:59.840
us in every way; and how everything in nature is
interdependent; how animals understand; and how

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:08.240
every amoeba and paramecium – is a unicellular
cell – also understands: what its group is doing

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:14.480
and what are the signals and how he receives
it; how bees understand where is the

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:19.040
honey and how they go and come back the
same way – there are no road-maps, nothing.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.680
Miles together how do they travel?

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:22.880
It’s very interesting.

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.880
And there are many books like
this, which you can find from

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.560
any biologist. Another is Du Noüy,
he’s a great biologist, I must say.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:36.160
Biologists, because they deal with life, I
think they are very much nearer the point.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.560
Another one is Jung who had experimented
with collective consciousness.

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.840
He says that there are dreams we
get which are universally the same

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.840
as far as the symbol is concerned.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:57.120
The symbols that they see whether here or
in India or in Australia or in Timbuktu.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:02.800
They’re all… when decoded… expressing the same thing.

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.920
For example if it has to express a fear,
harmony, anything, it expresses that.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.560
It’s surprising.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:16.640
After all there is somebody who is throwing
these symbols in the atmosphere where we live.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:23.840
From our unconscious, he says, these are coming.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:32.240
But all these things are like the finding
of people who are probing in the dark:

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:37.280
they find something here and find something there,
you find something there and you put it together.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.120
All these things can be put together.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.480
All these things can be bridged
together, integrated together

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:52.200
and can be shown, very easily,
if you get your self-realization.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:57.200
Self within you, is in your heart.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:12:59.520
Your Self.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.960
You know there is somebody who
knows everything about you.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.480
There is someone.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.600
If you murder someone, That one knows.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.720
If you do anything, That one knows.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.160
And That one that knows is the Self.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:21.120
Now when we talk of God, people have already
negated God: they say, “Where is God?

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:21.600
Let us see."

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.880
Without self-realization, you cannot know Him.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.560
You cannot know Him through all these
so-called conditionings that we have.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.640
Like we go to churches and pray,
go to the temples and pray,

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.360
sing songs and mantras and this and that.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:37.600
No.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:42.720
You cannot know Him through these
things because still you are outside.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.920
You have to come inside.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.960
You’ve done all the steps, everything, you
have to come inside, inside the door,

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.920
sit down and receive it.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:05.440
Self-knowledge is not the knowledge that:
you are a sinner, you are good for nothing

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.960
or you are a king or you are such and such.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.080
This is all outside.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:20.000
Self-knowledge is that,
that you are an instrument.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:32.720
You are an instrument and you have to act
for the dynamic forces of that Dynamic One,

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.960
the vast personality whom we call as God Almighty.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.800
You are that.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.560
Only thing is your instrument
is not yet connected with That.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.720
I said ‘til the animal stage we are one with it.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.920
We have no problems.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:58.720
Only when we become human beings then the diagram
shows there you see on the left the black,

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:03.920
right the black and another
side is the yellow-coloured in the head.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:13.440
These are the two balloons, which grow
with our activity, ego and superego.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:21.520
And they cover our head completely, by which
this fontanel bone, which is a soft bone

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:29.000
in the childhood –you have seen children they’re
so much one with the collective consciousness –

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:37.360
when it becomes hardened up there it
is because these two meet and overlap.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.480
Man is made like that.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.160
He has been given the freedom.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.440
He has been given the ‘I’ness.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.960
He develops this special thing.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.840
He has been given freedom because this
is the last stage of evolution now.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.480
Man has to jump by himself-understanding it.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.800
You do not know how you became human
beings from amoeba to this stage.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:10.560
But human beings will have to know
how they become one with themselves

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.720
and how they enter into the kingdom of God.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.680
That is their right and to have this
right they must have freedom and they

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:28.880
must develop their wisdom and discretion,
their temperance, – how to use that freedom.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:39.200
For this purpose, in our
being there is already placed

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.960
a residual power, which is called as
Kundalini, at the base of the spine.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.680
It is there.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.000
Now.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:57.200
Many Sahaja Yogis, I would say thousands, in
America and in India, and also other places,

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:02.000
have seen it with their own eyes the
pulsation of the Kundalini at that spine.

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:08.880
If there is obstruction in the
stomach by some disease or may be some

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.920
other trouble then this pulsation is much
heavier and you can see the Kundalini pulsating.

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.040
Very clearly.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.240
The pulsation travels upward
when the Kundalini rises.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.440
You can see that also.

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:31.280
You can also feel the different chakras – is the
centers – which are placed inside the spinal cord,

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.680
not outside as some books have written.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.360
All kinds of funny things they
have written about Kundalini.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.880
Anybody who felt like writing has written.

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:45.000
From the books they have taken something,
they have written such big, big books.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:50.080
It’s shocking because this is a
very subtle thing and a holy thing.

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.920
Most auspicious.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:59.840
The way they have handled Kundalini
is something one cannot imagine.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:13.680
The most highest and the holiest of
all has been insulted, has been ruined

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:19.040
by this kind of half-baked people
just for earning some money.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.960
How long do you carry your money with you?

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:28.000
Are you to carry it with you all your lives?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.960
Or for cheating people or for overpowering
some people – all kinds of things have

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.800
been done in this world in the name
of God, in the name of Kundalini.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:48.400
It really sometimes amazes me, how people are
really seriously giving sermons and talking

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:55.840
big in the name of God, wearing diamonds
all over… bought by somebody else’s money.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:07.040
And how can we the thinkers, the ones who have
got brains, accept such a situation where we find,

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:16.400
where we find that those who are so
much interested in all these things

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.000
and are trying to impress others
by getting it from others.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.960
We have been really misled.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:27.243
It’s a sad thing.

00:19:27.243 --> 00:19:27.840
It’s the saddest story.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.400
It wrenches my heart,

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:43.200
but I feel the innocent, the simple, the seekers…
the seekers have been the greatest victims.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.440
They have been – for money,

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:55.200
for vindictiveness, and also there
are satanic forces that have come up.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.600
They are trying also to exploit.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:07.680
They have come in their complete force,
in their full regiment they are up here.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:15.840
It’s hard to understand for you people
how you are gradually dragged into their

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:19.280
clutches and into their jaws and
they’re about to just clutch you.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:34.240
But you must know that God did not
create this creation to be destroyed.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.800
He did not create you to be destroyed.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.600
There’s nothing more powerful than God Himself

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:48.160
and it is going to work out and
you all are going to get it.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.000
I have no doubts about it.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.880
I have no doubts.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.080
Maybe some of you may not get it today.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:54.640
Possibly.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.600
But you can’t say that you
will not get it tomorrow.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:10.320
You will and you all should
have it because you are seekers.
