00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.542
So welcome to you all, Sahaja Yogis,

00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:15.959
to this great country of yoga.

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:29.250
Today first of all we have to establish

00:00:30.917 --> 00:00:36.500
our desire within ourselves

00:00:36.583 --> 00:00:39.250
that we are seekers

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:46.500
and that we have to achieve our full growth and maturity.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.500
Today's puja is for the whole universe.

00:00:54.166 --> 00:00:59.083
The whole universe

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.000
should be enlightened with your desires.

00:01:04.417 --> 00:01:08.333
Your desires should be so intense

00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:12.750
that they should emit out

00:01:12.834 --> 00:01:18.417
the pure vibrations of Mahakali Shakti,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.583
which is the pure desire

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:28.000
of attaining the spirit.

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:30.667
That's the real desire.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.999
All the other desires are like mirage.

00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:49.999
You are the people who are chosen by God.

00:01:52.083 --> 00:02:00.083
Specially, first to express your desire,

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:04.000
and then to achieve it.

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:15.750
And by intense desire of purity

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:20.500
you have to purify the whole world.

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:22.750
Not only the seekers,

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:27.083
but even those who are not seekers.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.834
You have to create an aura around this universe,

00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:47.834
of desire to achieve the ultimate,

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:51.333
the spirit.

00:02:57.083 --> 00:03:03.417
Without desire this universe would not have been created.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.500
This Desire of God is the one that is the Holy Ghost,

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:19.667
is this all-pervading power,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.750
is the Kundalini within you.

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:29.000
Kundalini has only one desire,

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:32.583
is to be the spirit

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.583
and anything else if you desire

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.750
the Kundalini doesn't rise.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.250
Only when it knows

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:51.917
that this desire is going to be fulfilled

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:02.917
by somebody, who is facing the seeker,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.583
it is awakened.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.250
If you do not have the desire,

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:18.250
no-one can force you.

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:20.750
Sahaja Yogis should never try

00:04:20.917 --> 00:04:26.083
to force this desire on other people.

00:04:26.166 --> 00:04:28.750
The first ordeal we face,

00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:32.333
as soon as you get your Realization,

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:38.000
is that you just start thinking of your family.

00:04:39.083 --> 00:04:42.667
You start thinking: 'My mother has not got it,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.999
my father has not got it,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.667
my wife has not got it,

00:04:48.834 --> 00:04:52.999
my children have not got it.'

00:04:55.417 --> 00:05:01.917
You must know that these relations are worldly.

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:04.166
Sanskrit is loukik.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.750
They are not aloukik,

00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:10.750
they are not beyond the worldly relationships.

00:05:10.917 --> 00:05:12.999
These are worldly relations,

00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:16.250
and these attachments are worldly.

00:05:16.333 --> 00:05:21.250
So if you play into that of course as you know,

00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:24.667
that Mahamaya Shakti allows you to play with that.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.917
You go ahead, as long as you like.

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:31.500
People bring Me all their relations,

00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:33.750
parents, this and that

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:36.250
and ultimately they discover

00:05:36.417 --> 00:05:41.583
that this was a very wrong thing they did.

00:05:41.667 --> 00:05:48.583
They lost so many precious moments,

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:51.250
so many hours, so many years,

00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:54.166
wasting their energy on people

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:59.333
who never deserved any attention of Mother.

00:05:59.667 --> 00:06:05.834
Sooner you realize the better that this desire

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:11.083
may be within you,

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.834
and may not be in anyone of your so-called worldly relations.

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:21.750
Makes no difference.

00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:24.166
As Christ was told

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:28.083
that His brothers and sisters are waiting outside,

00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:34.583
He said: 'Who are My brothers and who are My sisters?'

00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:40.667
So one has to realize that those people who involve themselves

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.083
into the problems of their family all the time,

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.166
and attract My attention,

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:51.000
you must know that I am just playing about.

00:06:51.083 --> 00:06:55.083
It is of no value to you.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.750
For your ascent it is important first of all

00:06:58.834 --> 00:07:01.083
to have no desires

00:07:01.166 --> 00:07:06.250
to create desire in your kith and kin.

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:11.250
This is the first principle of establishment

00:07:11.417 --> 00:07:15.417
of Mahakali Power.

00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:21.166
Specially in India

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.834
where people are too much attached to their family,

00:07:24.917 --> 00:07:28.667
it's a very big problem.

00:07:28.917 --> 00:07:32.083
If you give Realization to one person,

00:07:32.417 --> 00:07:36.834
you are amazed to see that all relationship they have

00:07:36.917 --> 00:07:40.417
is with a big bunch of bhoots.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:46.667
And once you give Realization to one person you are in for trouble.

00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:50.917
Then all the bhoots walk in, slowly,

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:54.583
torturing My life, wasting My energy,

00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:58.333
and absolutely disgusting.

00:07:58.917 --> 00:08:01.667
It should happen to you to understand

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.834
that this is not auspicious.

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:07.500
If you want to waste your time,

00:08:07.583 --> 00:08:11.417
I will allow you to waste your time.

00:08:11.667 --> 00:08:17.750
But if you want to have the ascent fast,

00:08:17.834 --> 00:08:19.999
first of all one must remember

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:25.000
that these are relations which are absolutely worldly relations

00:08:25.083 --> 00:08:29.000
and this is not your pure desire.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.834
So try to separate your pure desire

00:08:33.917 --> 00:08:38.083
from your worldly desires.

00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:42.583
It does not by any means,

00:08:42.834 --> 00:08:47.417
suggest that you give up your family,

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:51.999
you give up your mother or give up your sister - nothing.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.333
But you witness them

00:08:54.417 --> 00:09:00.500
and see, as you would see anybody else,

00:09:01.834 --> 00:09:05.999
and see for yourself, whether

00:09:06.083 --> 00:09:09.999
they are really desirous or not.

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:11.750
If they are - well and good.

00:09:11.834 --> 00:09:15.417
They should not be disqualified because they are your relations.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.333
It works both ways.

00:09:17.417 --> 00:09:21.083
As they cannot be qualified because they are your relations,

00:09:21.166 --> 00:09:26.417
they cannot be disqualified because they're your relations.

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:34.667
So in Sahaja Yoga to make your desire a pure desire,

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:41.999
you have to get out of so many things.

00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:46.583
But for people who are attached to their family,

00:09:46.834 --> 00:09:50.333
are bound by their family,

00:09:50.583 --> 00:09:52.500
they have to see to it

00:09:52.667 --> 00:09:56.500
that they do not force Sahaja Yoga on anyone of their relations,

00:09:56.583 --> 00:10:00.583
at least don't force them on Me.

00:11:08.542 --> 00:11:14.709
Now this desire within us,

00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:19.208
which is the Mahakali Power which is manifesting,

00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:22.667
comes to us in so many ways.

00:11:22.792 --> 00:11:25.208
As I told you first of all,

00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:27.750
it comes to us after Realization,

00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:30.125
because you are all Sahaja Yogis,

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:35.709
to do something about our relations.

00:11:35.917 --> 00:11:39.166
Then the second desire that comes to us,

00:11:39.417 --> 00:11:44.291
that let us try to cure people,

00:11:44.375 --> 00:11:48.917
who are our relations.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.375
This is the second desire,

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.917
you should face yourself and see,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.125
that this has happened to many of you.

00:11:56.208 --> 00:12:01.750
So, right from leprosy

00:12:01.999 --> 00:12:07.125
to any small thing like cold or sneezing,

00:12:07.208 --> 00:12:09.458
whatever they have,

00:12:09.709 --> 00:12:15.417
you think you should bring to Mother.

00:12:17.208 --> 00:12:22.709
And all the worries of your families should be brought to Mother.

00:12:22.834 --> 00:12:27.250
Simple thing like pregnancy or sneezing,

00:12:27.458 --> 00:12:32.458
very simple things - which are so natural

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:39.709
are brought into your attention.

00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:43.166
So when you have them in your attention I say:

00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:48.625
'All right, go ahead with it. Try to solve it, if possible.'

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.375
But if you do not have them in your attention

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.417
they are in My attention.

00:12:57.625 --> 00:13:02.333
You leave them in My attention, I'll manage that.

00:13:02.417 --> 00:13:06.458
But then it's a vicious circle.

00:13:07.125 --> 00:13:11.125
It's a very subtle projection of the mind

00:13:11.208 --> 00:13:13.000
that thinks: 'All right,

00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:15.208
that Mother we don't have this in our attention,

00:13:15.291 --> 00:13:21.041
You'd better look after it." That's not the way.

00:13:21.125 --> 00:13:26.041
You should have only one intense desire within yourself:

00:13:26.125 --> 00:13:29.834
"Have I become the spirit?

00:13:30.208 --> 00:13:34.041
Have I achieved my ultimate?

00:13:34.166 --> 00:13:38.999
Have I risen above the worldly desires?"

00:13:39.041 --> 00:13:42.041
Purify it.

00:13:44.333 --> 00:13:47.875
Once you start purifying whatever falls off,

00:13:47.999 --> 00:13:51.125
I'll look after that.

00:13:51.208 --> 00:13:57.125
This is just an assurance, but not a guarantee.

00:13:58.709 --> 00:14:05.625
If it deserves My attention I will definitely look after you.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:14.834
You have to value your attention as I value My attention.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:23.250
I think you have to value much more of your attention

00:14:24.291 --> 00:14:28.999
than Me, because I can manage,

00:14:29.166 --> 00:14:30.834
many more things within Myself,

00:14:30.959 --> 00:14:36.417
because everything is in My attention.

00:14:37.375 --> 00:14:42.375
But you try to purify your desires,

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:47.500
away from the worldly problems that are facing you.

00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:51.500
So you expand it more, then you start thinking:

00:14:51.625 --> 00:14:58.792
'Mother, what about the problem of our country?'

00:15:02.208 --> 00:15:05.792
All right, give Me the map of your country - finished.

00:15:05.875 --> 00:15:09.458
That's more than sufficient.

00:15:12.999 --> 00:15:17.083
Then purify yourself.

00:15:17.208 --> 00:15:22.291
The desire that you have, you leave it.

00:15:22.417 --> 00:15:23.999
And once you are purified

00:15:24.083 --> 00:15:27.125
that area will be covered through your attention,

00:15:27.208 --> 00:15:31.125
it's very interesting.

00:15:31.208 --> 00:15:37.917
When you get over it then only you can throw light,

00:15:38.583 --> 00:15:41.208
but if you are inside you are hidden by that.

00:15:41.333 --> 00:15:44.875
Your light is hidden, there's no light emitted.

00:15:44.999 --> 00:15:47.750
You all rise above that desire.

00:15:47.875 --> 00:15:50.834
Every time you get a desire you rise above it,

00:15:50.959 --> 00:15:55.667
so your light is emitted on that wider problem

00:15:55.792 --> 00:15:57.542
that you are facing

00:15:57.667 --> 00:16:02.999
which you think should be solved by Me.

00:16:03.875 --> 00:16:08.959
These are all My headaches which you are taking on yourself.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.291
You have to do only one thing is to become the spirit

00:16:12.417 --> 00:16:14.959
that's all. Is a simple thing.

00:16:15.041 --> 00:16:19.500
The rest of it is My headache.

00:16:21.417 --> 00:16:27.875
Now the problems

00:16:27.959 --> 00:16:34.959
that should take your desire on the collective

00:16:35.041 --> 00:16:42.792
should be very different.

00:16:43.709 --> 00:16:48.667
To substantiate your purity,

00:16:48.917 --> 00:16:53.917
to be fragrant with your purity,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.291
your attention should be on the other side.

00:16:57.375 --> 00:16:59.083
Now you are not facing Me,

00:16:59.166 --> 00:17:01.333
you are sitting with Me facing the whole world.

00:17:01.417 --> 00:17:06.750
See, the whole attitude will change.

00:17:06.834 --> 00:17:12.125
The attitude should be: 'What can I give?

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:15.583
How can I give?

00:17:15.709 --> 00:17:18.999
What is my mistake in giving?

00:17:19.083 --> 00:17:21.625
I have to be more alert.

00:17:21.709 --> 00:17:26.041
Where is my attention?

00:17:26.291 --> 00:17:28.542
I have to be more alert towards myself

00:17:28.625 --> 00:17:32.917
what am I doing?

00:17:33.417 --> 00:17:38.041
What's my responsibility?'

00:17:40.041 --> 00:17:46.000
You must desire that you should be pure.

00:17:46.083 --> 00:17:49.250
You should be pure desire.

00:17:49.375 --> 00:17:53.083
That means you should be the spirit.

00:17:53.208 --> 00:17:58.125
That, "What is your responsibility to yourself?"

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:04.375
You should desire that your responsibility to yourself

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:08.208
should be manifested,

00:18:08.333 --> 00:18:12.792
should be complete.

00:18:12.875 --> 00:18:18.583
Then your responsibility to this Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:18.667 --> 00:18:22.583
What is your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:22.667 --> 00:18:25.125
which is the work of God,

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:31.667
which has started and you are My hands.

00:18:33.417 --> 00:18:37.542
You have to do the work of God,

00:18:37.667 --> 00:18:42.000
and you have to fight the anti-God elements,

00:18:42.125 --> 00:18:44.500
the satanic elements.

00:18:44.709 --> 00:18:47.125
You are not responsible for your family any more,

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.875
those who are, are half-baked Sahaja Yogis

00:18:50.999 --> 00:18:54.667
I said, are useless absolutely good for nothing.

00:18:54.792 --> 00:18:57.500
All such will drop out, their families will suffer,

00:18:57.583 --> 00:19:00.166
I know this is going to happen.

00:19:00.291 --> 00:19:02.667
Because now the forces are gathering in such a way

00:19:02.792 --> 00:19:06.417
that sorting out will start.

00:19:06.542 --> 00:19:11.917
Your responsibility to yourself, to be the spirit,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.125
your responsibility to Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:18.999 --> 00:19:23.291
your responsibility to understand Me,

00:19:23.417 --> 00:19:27.959
better and better and better.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.041
Your responsibility to understand this mechanism

00:19:31.125 --> 00:19:34.125
that is within you,

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:38.333
your responsibility to understand how this mechanism

00:19:38.458 --> 00:19:43.000
works out everything.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:48.999
The responsibility is to how to become a guru yourself.

00:19:49.917 --> 00:19:55.458
Your responsibility to be a dignified and a glorified personality.

00:19:55.583 --> 00:19:58.250
A responsibility to be a respectable person

00:19:58.375 --> 00:20:03.125
and not a cheap personality.

00:20:03.667 --> 00:20:06.250
Every one of you

00:20:06.333 --> 00:20:13.542
is worth the whole universe.

00:20:14.959 --> 00:20:19.750
If you want to rise to that height.

00:20:21.125 --> 00:20:27.417
Universes of universes can be thrown away at your feet.

00:20:27.959 --> 00:20:30.500
If you want to rise to that height,

00:20:30.583 --> 00:20:36.625
to that magnitude that is within you to prosper.

00:20:38.709 --> 00:20:41.208
But those people,

00:20:41.333 --> 00:20:51.250
who still want to live on a very low level cannot rise.

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.625
For example,

00:20:55.709 --> 00:21:00.417
the western Sahaja Yogis have certain problems

00:21:02.333 --> 00:21:08.792
of committing the sin against the Mother,

00:21:08.917 --> 00:21:11.959
and the eastern Sahaja Yogis have the problem

00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:16.750
of committing sin against the Father.

00:21:17.834 --> 00:21:23.750
It's not difficult at all

00:21:25.125 --> 00:21:30.041
for you to get out of it.

00:21:36.792 --> 00:21:44.875
The attention is to be kept pure.

00:21:45.083 --> 00:21:49.917
In Sahaja Yoga you know all the methods

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.291
how the attention one can keep it pure.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.542
If the attention is not pure

00:21:57.667 --> 00:22:00.750
then this desire

00:22:00.875 --> 00:22:05.542
will be always attacked

00:22:05.667 --> 00:22:08.583
by all petty nonsensical things

00:22:08.709 --> 00:22:12.667
which has no meaning in your ascent.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.709
Now a person who is a good Sahaja Yogi

00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:18.417
is not bothered about clothes, what others say to him

00:22:18.542 --> 00:22:20.667
or what others are talking to him,

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:22.583
how they are behaving towards him and

00:22:22.709 --> 00:22:26.458
the attention is not on that

00:22:26.583 --> 00:22:31.625
criticism that this person is like this, that person is like that.

00:22:31.709 --> 00:22:37.500
Nor there is the aggressiveness

00:22:39.709 --> 00:22:43.667
of anyone else,

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.709
because nobody is the other.

00:22:46.834 --> 00:22:51.583
But the problem is when I say that,

00:22:51.834 --> 00:22:57.625
no-one thinks that I'm saying about you, each persons.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:02.125
Those who are aggressive take the other role

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:08.750
and those who are non-aggressive think the other way.

00:23:09.166 --> 00:23:13.083
Like I say something for a person who is aggressive,

00:23:13.166 --> 00:23:16.542
the non-aggressive immediately thinks of the person who is aggressive,

00:23:16.625 --> 00:23:20.125
not about himself.

00:23:20.208 --> 00:23:23.333
You immediately start shifting your mind to other person,

00:23:23.417 --> 00:23:27.999
finding faults with other people.

00:23:30.417 --> 00:23:34.291
So this desire becomes

00:23:34.417 --> 00:23:40.125
gradually lower and lower and lower

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:45.291
because of the loads that are put onto it.

00:23:45.417 --> 00:23:48.792
So the alertness is very important,

00:23:48.917 --> 00:23:53.917
complete alertness - satarkata,

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:59.041
that we should keep our attention

00:23:59.125 --> 00:24:06.959
purely for the sustenance of our pure desire.

00:24:08.667 --> 00:24:13.000
Desire comes from your heart

00:24:13.125 --> 00:24:14.875
and you are so built

00:24:14.959 --> 00:24:19.458
that your brahmarandra is also the heart.

00:24:19.583 --> 00:24:22.542
If you don't have a clean heart,

00:24:22.625 --> 00:24:27.000
this won't keep clean.

00:24:27.083 --> 00:24:29.792
There are people

00:24:29.917 --> 00:24:32.625
who think if they talk about Sahaja Yoga big,

00:24:32.709 --> 00:24:35.792
and all that, they are all right.

00:24:35.875 --> 00:24:39.333
They are cheating themselves.

00:24:39.583 --> 00:24:43.333
If the heart is not open

00:24:43.458 --> 00:24:46.999
then this is closed.

00:24:47.041 --> 00:24:53.291
So try to open your heart by projecting.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:02.417
Projecting it.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:06.542
I hope today when you do this puja

00:25:06.667 --> 00:25:10.709
and you do the worship of Mahakali

00:25:10.834 --> 00:25:15.750
and this special yagya,

00:25:15.875 --> 00:25:20.542
we will definitely establish this aura,

00:25:20.667 --> 00:25:25.417
and enlighten the universe.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.333
But your outlook should be:

00:25:27.458 --> 00:25:32.458
'How much I have contributed to this.

00:25:33.375 --> 00:25:36.709
Am I still thinking of other people,

00:25:36.834 --> 00:25:41.917
am I still thinking of my petty small problems,

00:25:41.999 --> 00:25:48.250
or I'm thinking of my spirit?'

00:25:49.959 --> 00:25:55.291
So, the left side

00:25:55.500 --> 00:26:02.625
starts and ends with Shri Ganesh.

00:26:02.709 --> 00:26:09.041
Shri Ganesh has only basic one quality,

00:26:09.125 --> 00:26:12.000
that He's completely surrendered to His Mother,

00:26:12.083 --> 00:26:15.792
He does not know any other God,

00:26:15.917 --> 00:26:19.542
He does not even know His Father.

00:26:20.083 --> 00:26:22.250
He only knows His Mother

00:26:22.375 --> 00:26:28.834
and completely surrendered to Her.

00:26:32.375 --> 00:26:38.500
But this pure desire has to have the action,

00:26:39.125 --> 00:26:41.208
and about which I'll tell you later

00:26:41.291 --> 00:26:45.875
as we will be having more pujas and more pujas.

00:26:45.959 --> 00:26:51.792
But today let us establish ourselves

00:26:52.834 --> 00:26:59.875
into that pure desire, to be the spirit.

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:08.041
Now, as it is, with the western mind we'll say: 'How?'

00:27:10.417 --> 00:27:15.542
Is always coming, "How to do it?"

00:27:15.625 --> 00:27:22.291
Should I tell you? It's very simple.

00:27:22.417 --> 00:27:27.291
Adi Shankaracharya wrote 'Viveka Chudamani'

00:27:27.417 --> 00:27:31.875
and so many other books of treaties,

00:27:31.959 --> 00:27:38.500
and then all these big intellectuals got after his life.

00:27:38.583 --> 00:27:40.875
And they said:

00:27:40.999 --> 00:27:44.083
'How this and how that and how?'

00:27:44.166 --> 00:27:46.667
He said: 'Forget these people.'

00:27:46.792 --> 00:27:51.458
Then he wrote 'Saundarya Lahari',

00:27:51.542 --> 00:27:53.667
it's just a description of his Mother

00:27:53.875 --> 00:27:56.208
and his devotion to Her

00:27:56.291 --> 00:28:05.709
and every couplet that He wrote is a mantra.

00:28:06.333 --> 00:28:08.083
It is not the surrender

00:28:08.166 --> 00:28:14.083
of your mind through your mind,

00:28:14.208 --> 00:28:19.959
but the surrender of your heart.

00:28:22.999 --> 00:28:26.917
Is absolutely the surrender of your heart.

00:28:26.999 --> 00:28:30.959
Western Sahaja Yogis know very well

00:28:31.125 --> 00:28:34.500
how there have been attacks

00:28:34.583 --> 00:28:38.500
and attacks of negativity on them,

00:28:38.667 --> 00:28:45.166
specially when horrible people like Freud

00:28:45.709 --> 00:28:53.125
came to destroy their basic, the roots.

00:28:53.208 --> 00:28:58.500
And how the West accepted it blindfolded,

00:28:58.625 --> 00:29:03.667
and put them on the path of hell.

00:29:03.792 --> 00:29:07.500
All that has to be brought out.

00:29:07.625 --> 00:29:11.792
That is all nonsense, is wrong, absolutely

00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:16.750
against God, it's anti-God activity.

00:29:16.959 --> 00:29:20.291
Then you will realize

00:29:20.417 --> 00:29:28.792
that you will fight fully, by saying,

00:29:28.917 --> 00:29:35.583
"This is the destruction of our basics, our roots,

00:29:35.709 --> 00:29:37.125
when our Mother is the source

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:42.000
of everything that is sublime, noble,

00:29:42.417 --> 00:29:45.375
all that is nourishing,

00:29:45.458 --> 00:29:51.000
all that is elevating, emancipating.

00:29:51.083 --> 00:29:54.625
You have cutting us from our roots.

00:29:54.709 --> 00:30:00.208
"When he dealt with, I think, animal-like creatures

00:30:00.291 --> 00:30:07.458
and he wants all of you to go down to that low level

00:30:07.583 --> 00:30:11.166
of human beings,

00:30:11.291 --> 00:30:19.333
which exist as pathological cases, I don't know.

00:30:19.458 --> 00:30:23.000
So it is important for you to understand all the attacks

00:30:23.125 --> 00:30:24.709
that came on you,

00:30:24.792 --> 00:30:26.291
and be alert

00:30:26.375 --> 00:30:31.999
and don't be identified with anyone of these.

00:30:32.041 --> 00:30:35.417
Last I would say you have come to this country

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:39.959
to see the roots and not the shoot.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.375
Change your attitude of western style.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.875
Telephones are no good.

00:30:45.959 --> 00:30:48.375
You cannot get any telephones done here.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:51.625
Postage is horrible.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.750
Railways are worst.

00:30:53.875 --> 00:31:00.000
I shouldn't say because we are in a railway.

00:31:04.959 --> 00:31:12.125
But, the people are excellent.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.083
They know what is dharma.

00:31:14.208 --> 00:31:16.000
They are not being attacked, somehow or other

00:31:16.125 --> 00:31:17.999
because it being the Kundalini.

00:31:18.041 --> 00:31:23.667
The Ganesha is sitting here how dare anybody attack?

00:31:23.875 --> 00:31:28.125
This great Maharashtra has got eight Ganeshas,

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.333
protecting them.

00:31:29.417 --> 00:31:33.417
I don't know if these Maharashtrians know this fact.

00:31:33.542 --> 00:31:35.875
And so many marutis,

00:31:35.999 --> 00:31:38.625
so who can attack this country?

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:40.000
There is no negative attack

00:31:40.125 --> 00:31:45.417
except that they themselves are rather money-minded sort.

00:31:45.542 --> 00:31:48.583
That's the only curse they have, if they can get out of it

00:31:48.667 --> 00:31:52.500
they are great people.

00:31:55.542 --> 00:32:02.417
So, we have come to this country not to enjoy the comfort

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:07.792
of the West, but the comfort of the spirit.

00:32:07.917 --> 00:32:13.333
So to change your attitude towards India

00:32:13.417 --> 00:32:18.750
I don't mean Air India, by any chance.

00:32:18.834 --> 00:32:21.625
This is a wrong idea that you come by Air India

00:32:21.709 --> 00:32:24.208
because you are a Sahaja Yogi. Not at all.

00:32:24.291 --> 00:32:27.291
Air India is nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:27.417 --> 00:32:29.792
All our railways, all our everything,

00:32:29.875 --> 00:32:31.834
they have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:31.917 --> 00:32:34.250
so far.

00:32:36.709 --> 00:32:40.792
So you be patriotic and use your own airlines,

00:32:40.917 --> 00:32:44.375
for heaven's sake.

00:32:45.625 --> 00:32:48.125
But when you arrive here

00:32:48.208 --> 00:32:51.250
you will see that the people are too innocent,

00:32:51.375 --> 00:32:53.834
they can't understand Freud, you can't talk to them,

00:32:53.917 --> 00:32:56.542
it's beyond them.

00:32:56.667 --> 00:32:59.000
They are a higher type of people in this respect

00:32:59.125 --> 00:33:01.291
now because they are not attacked,

00:33:01.417 --> 00:33:04.083
while you are higher in a way that though you are attacked

00:33:04.166 --> 00:33:07.583
you've come out of it.

00:33:07.709 --> 00:33:11.125
You just turn your faces and you are on the other way.

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:16.333
That's something great.

00:33:16.458 --> 00:33:19.083
So you would also have a confidence

00:33:19.208 --> 00:33:22.250
there are many people who believe the same way as you believe,

00:33:22.333 --> 00:33:27.792
in this big country where there's such a big population to support you.

00:33:27.917 --> 00:33:32.999
So you shouldn't feel lost.

00:33:34.083 --> 00:33:38.792
Thus today, we have to start this puja,

00:33:38.917 --> 00:33:42.709
on Mahakali Day.

00:33:42.792 --> 00:33:47.125
And it's the Day of the Gauri we can say,

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:50.333
and Ganesh-Gauri's Day today,

00:33:50.458 --> 00:33:56.959
though according to the schedule time it may not be.

00:33:57.041 --> 00:33:58.875
But according to Me,

00:33:58.959 --> 00:34:03.458
let us establish within ourself on a subtler level

00:34:03.583 --> 00:34:09.333
the desire to be pure,

00:34:12.583 --> 00:34:16.709
and to be cleansed out.

00:34:16.792 --> 00:34:24.041
All the barriers and unclean things that are within us,

00:34:24.625 --> 00:34:29.291
to desire to be great Sahaja Yogis,

00:34:29.417 --> 00:34:36.000
desire to be responsible Sahaja Yogis

00:34:36.083 --> 00:34:40.999
and desire to be surrendered to your Mother.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.083
It's not difficult.

00:34:43.166 --> 00:34:46.208
That is the easiest, the last one is the easiest,

00:34:46.291 --> 00:34:48.291
because what you surrender,

00:34:48.417 --> 00:34:51.375
I don't want anything from you,

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:56.542
except that you accept My Love.

00:34:56.667 --> 00:35:01.542
Surrendering just means you open your heart to accept My Love.

00:35:01.667 --> 00:35:04.500
Give up this ego.

00:35:04.625 --> 00:35:07.834
That's all and it will work out.

00:35:07.917 --> 00:35:12.125
I'm sure it's going to work out.

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:15.625
I am trying to push Myself into your hearts

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:19.667
and I'll definitely settle down there.

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:21.792
Mahakali has a special capacity to weep,

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.041
because She is left-sided.

01:00:24.125 --> 01:00:26.542
When She's helpless and She cannot act,

01:00:26.667 --> 01:00:29.417
She weeps.

01:00:29.542 --> 01:00:31.709
This is the only manifestation

01:00:31.834 --> 01:00:34.917
of Mahakali is that She desires,

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.417
and if She doesn't get Her desire enacted

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:39.917
then She just weeps,

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.125
that's the only thing She can do in helplessness, isn't it.

01:00:43.291 --> 01:00:47.542
And sometimes when She's full of Love

01:00:47.625 --> 01:00:50.667
as I've seen you today all of you coming down here

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.792
and all these people sitting down here.

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:56.875
When She cannot express Herself fully,

01:00:56.999 --> 01:00:59.041
with full heart,

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:09.375
also She feels that joy pouring as tears.

01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:11.667
May God bless you for today's puja,

01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:15.375
I hope all of you will take it in such a way

01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:18.000
that the subtlest of subtle

01:01:18.125 --> 01:01:20.667
will be awakened within you, the sensitivity

01:01:20.792 --> 01:01:24.792
every way, and the Love,

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.083
which culminates into joy.

01:01:28.166 --> 01:01:34.500
Love that flowers into the fragrance of joy

01:01:34.625 --> 01:01:39.792
will manifest in today's puja.

01:01:39.875 --> 01:01:42.709
May God bless you!
