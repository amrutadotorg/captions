1
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:22,600
Today we have assembled here to celebrate the Sahasrara Day

2
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:30,727
which was opened in 1970 on this date.

3
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:45,400
I find this beautiful canopy is like our Sahasrara,

4
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,080
and so very apt

5
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:59,840
to have this beautiful arrangement for Sahasrara Day.

6
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:12,240
We have to understand what happens when the Sahasrara opens.

7
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:19,680
When the Kundalini passes through the five centers,

8
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:26,940
it enters into the area which we call as limbic area.

9
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,780
This area is all surrounded by thousand nerves.

10
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,040
And when these nerves get enlightened,

11
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:46,680
they look like flames of vibgyor colors, seven colors,

12
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:59,680
and very mildly, beautifully shining, emitting peace.

13
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:12,280
But when the Kundalini starts emitting its vibration

14
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,760
on the sides,

15
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:33,200
all these nerves get enlightened gradually

16
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:43,120
and start moving on all directions, opening the Sahasrara.

17
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,600
And then the Kundalini

18
00:02:54,999 --> 00:03:08,560
emerges out through the fontanel bone area

19
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,899
which we call as Brahmarandhra.

20
00:03:12,999 --> 00:03:15,880
Randhra means "the hole"

21
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:23,640
and the Brahma is the all-pervading Power of God's love.

22
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:35,440
So it enters into the subtle energy which is all-pervading

23
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,280
which we do not feel normally.

24
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:48,540
But then the Chaitanya, the vibrations

25
00:03:48,640 --> 00:04:00,980
which are the part and parcel of this energy, all-pervading Power,

26
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:06,840
the Paramachaitanya,

27
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:14,520
they start entering into our brain;

28
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:24,120
and showering their blessings, in the limbic area they assemble.

29
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:33,899
Now the limbic area is connected to all the area of the brain

30
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:38,840
and also to the nerves.

31
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,540
So it starts flowing onto the nerves,

32
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,599
giving you the new awareness of collective consciousness

33
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,780
called as samuhik chetana.

34
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,640
So you get a new chetana, a new awareness

35
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:11,760
which is showered upon your limbic area.

36
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:21,720
The working of these Chaitanya waves is very interesting.

37
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:31,800
They are normally formed like small commas,

38
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,960
but then they go into different forms.

39
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,400
They make themselves into swastikas,

40
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:51,358
as the four-limbed symbol of innocence.

41
00:05:53,264 --> 00:06:01,480
Or they become the Aumkara, as you know how Aum is written,

42
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:13,520
which is the symbol of our doing, our awareness.

43
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:27,270
So when they form the swastika they try to nourish the left side,

44
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:32,098
and when they form the Aumkara they nourish the right side.

45
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:36,943
Left and right sympathetic nervous system they nourish.

46
00:06:39,588 --> 00:06:47,359
But Sahasrara is to be kept open

47
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,720
it's rather difficult for people

48
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:54,840
because it's a vicious circle.

49
00:06:54,999 --> 00:07:00,320
First these vibrations should enter into your brain

50
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,440
through the Brahmarandhra when it is opened out,

51
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,189
and they should nourish your nerves

52
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:16,329
by which your left and right side open out;

53
00:07:16,532 --> 00:07:24,780
and so more Chaitanya can flow down all these centers.

54
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,899
But if your Sahasrara is not properly opened,

55
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:37,580
this process doesn't take place.

56
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,899
As a result of that, the chakras don't open,

57
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:57,999
the Kundalini only as very few strands is kept in the spinal cord,

58
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:09,600
and the new strands cannot rise because your chakras are not open.

59
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:18,360
So in Sahaja Yoga it is very important to keep your Sahasrara open,

60
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,880
otherwise there's a vicious circle.

61
00:08:23,965 --> 00:08:28,500
To keep the Sahasrara open is in a way very easy,

62
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,080
as well as difficult.

63
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,430
As you have known in the Devi Mahatmyam

64
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:42,877
that at Sahasrara, Mahamaya comes.

65
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:48,160
She is a Mahamaya: not easy to recognize Her,

66
00:08:48,415 --> 00:08:51,040
not easy to know Her.

67
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,999
She lives just like you,

68
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:57,320
She moves just like you,

69
00:08:57,527 --> 00:09:04,687
and you can never make out Her real nature.

70
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,880
She is in the form of Mahamaya.

71
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:20,280
So at the Sahasrara, to recognize the Mahamaya is another vicious circle.

72
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,100
You may say that why should it be Mahamaya?

73
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,580
should have been better as starkingly some other form.

74
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,540
But any other form could not have worked out Sahaja Yoga

75
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,720
in modern times;

76
00:09:36,705 --> 00:09:43,000
because people would have been frightened and upset

77
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,320
and they would never have taken to Sahaja Yoga,

78
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,999
because they had no discretion already

79
00:09:49,148 --> 00:09:52,580
within them to know what is right, what is wrong.

80
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:59,306
That is why it had to be in the Mahamaya form.

81
00:09:59,477 --> 00:10:04,980
In the Mahamaya form you have to recognize.

82
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,805
This is another test because Mahamaya you cannot recognize,

83
00:10:09,905 --> 00:10:13,666
while you have to recognize.

84
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,360
But in Sahaja Yoga you have seen so many photographs

85
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,000
which should convince you people mentally

86
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,040
about this Mahamaya swarupa.

87
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,999
You can see mentally, you can understand there's something very different.

88
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,720
Even when I came to Napoli,

89
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:42,899
the policeman and everybody was given a photograph

90
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:46,060
and they all recognized that there is something very different,

91
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,160
they all wanted to shake hands with Me.

92
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,200
This is one way.

93
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,400
Another way is that you start seeing the blessings,

94
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,258
and you start seeing how you become so progressively

95
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:09,757
better materially, physically, emotionally, and spiritually.

96
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:16,440
Still on a mental level most of the people recognize.

97
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:27,920
But unless and until it is recognized in the heart,

98
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:33,360
it's no recognition.

99
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:48,557
Already the heart is surrounded by seven auras of the seven chakras.

100
00:11:50,714 --> 00:11:55,874
And the spirit, the Atma, resides in the heart.

101
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:02,340
As it is, on top of your head here

102
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,680
resides the God Almighty, Sadashiva.

103
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:12,928
So when Kundalini touches that point

104
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:16,500
your spirit gets awakened

105
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:21,999
and the light of the spirit starts spreading,

106
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,899
and it starts acting on your central nervous system;

107
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:35,400
because automatically the vibrations,

108
00:12:35,999 --> 00:12:40,670
the Chaitanya flow into your brain

109
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:45,010
who enlighten your nerves.

110
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:56,480
But still the recognition on the heart is not there.

111
00:12:56,869 --> 00:13:02,229
Even without that you start feeling the cool breeze,

112
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,726
you can raise the kundalini of others

113
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:09,066
you can cure people,

114
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,455
you can do many things,

115
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:20,115
but still it is not yet felt in the heart so much.

116
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,800
That's why we have music, art

117
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:38,040
all these things start opening your heart.

118
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,220
But still it is not recognition,

119
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:46,440
because recognition is a mental activity of the heart.

120
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:51,240
How can heart have a mental activity?

121
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,899
This is another problem you all can face, and I know that

122
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:03,342
that recognition, if it is a mental activity of the heart,

123
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:06,242
how do we do it?

124
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,660
Say, if you are a Christian born in a Christian family,

125
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,180
as soon as you see the photograph of Christ,

126
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,260
immediately you feel it is Christ, you see - something here.

127
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,220
Or if you are a Hindu, if you see the photograph of Shri Rama,

128
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,999
immediately you know it's Shri Ram, you see - there's a kind of a thing,

129
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:32,270
recognition in the heart.

130
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:39,260
But the recognition of somebody living with you

131
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,999
is very, very difficult,

132
00:14:42,204 --> 00:14:50,360
and you live on the cusp of your mental activities only.

133
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,240
But to go deep down into your heart,

134
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,520
"What should we do?" people tell Me.

135
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,160
"Mother, how should we get into our heart?

136
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:14,304
How this mental activity can be performed through the heart?"

137
00:15:14,405 --> 00:15:21,520
Now you must remember that heart is absolutely connected with brain,

138
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,200
absolutely connected.

139
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:33,409
It's not disconnected thing if it was, it would not have worked out.

140
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:41,360
When heart fails, after some time brain also fails;

141
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,280
the whole body goes out of order.

142
00:16:30,142 --> 00:16:41,262
So this mental activity of the heart is to be understood this way,

143
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,920
that as soon as you see the danger,

144
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,020
without even thinking, in a reflex way

145
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,280
your heart starts pumping more blood and you get palpitation.

146
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,220
You don't have to think, there's no mental activity;

147
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,160
just you see supposing a tiger standing before you,

148
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,327
immediately the heart will start pumping.

149
00:17:12,427 --> 00:17:15,787
It's a reflex action.

150
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,500
Now how this activity takes place, one may say,

151
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,060
is that because it is built in within you

152
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,660
that as soon as you see some emergency

153
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,080
your sympathetic nervous system goes into activity,

154
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:38,875
and you start feeling the fear,

155
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:44,340
you start feeling that there should be some protection,

156
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,340
that you should do something about it.

157
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,060
But you do not think, you just run,

158
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,899
you run as fast as possible.

159
00:17:53,999 --> 00:17:55,300
You don't think about it

160
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,260
"what I should do, where I should run?"

161
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:04,500
just you go on running away from the danger.

162
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,700
And how do you do that?

163
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,980
Because it is built in within you, all this, in your brain

164
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,420
that as soon as the heart starts pumping too much blood,

165
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:26,194
it should just make the legs work and the hands work and you should run.

166
00:18:26,294 --> 00:18:31,499
Or we can say it is in the central nervous system built in,

167
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,080
the fear.

168
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,478
Any reaction, any response like that is built in within you.

169
00:18:43,478 --> 00:18:51,560
But the response to the spirituality is not yet manifested.

170
00:18:52,999 --> 00:19:00,800
It is manifested. It is all built, no doubt,

171
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,999
but it is not yet manifested.

172
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,840
And how will it manifest?

173
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,160
That's what people ask Me, "Mother, how will it manifest?"

174
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:23,840
Through your past

175
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:26,420
you have learnt that you have to be afraid of this,

176
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,728
you have to be afraid of that.

177
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:31,881
Also in this lifetime you have learnt many things.

178
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,938
For a child may put his hand to the candle, won't feel, be frightened;

179
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:40,088
but a grown-up would, because of an experience.

180
00:19:40,188 --> 00:19:44,600
With the experience gradually you built in

181
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,480
that reaction of reflex within you, so that you'll try to save yourself.

182
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,600
Now what experience you should have

183
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:04,026
to build that in your heart, is the point.

184
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:13,135
And the experience is of your own divinity,

185
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,560
of your own spirituality.

186
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:31,035
Once you start developing that experience,

187
00:20:31,135 --> 00:20:35,899
then you know that you are a divine person.

188
00:20:35,999 --> 00:20:44,280
Unless and until you are aware fully that you are a divine person,

189
00:20:44,502 --> 00:20:51,340
howsoever faith you may have in Me, the recognition is not complete

190
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,446
because who is recognizing Me is a blind person.

191
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,020
If a blind person is recognizing Me,

192
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,899
it won't have that response of the heart.

193
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:09,200
So first you have to recognize yourself to be a divine person,

194
00:21:09,356 --> 00:21:12,996
to have faith in yourself.
