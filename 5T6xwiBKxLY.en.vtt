00:00:21.416 --> 00:00:44.802
So, thank you very much for the greetings
on this day. It was a Easter Monday when I

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:52.811
got married that day, and also My baptism
took place on Easter Monday. But you know

00:00:52.842 --> 00:00:59.152
our Easter Monday always changes according
to the Monday it comes.

00:00:59.152 --> 00:01:14.415
So it was quite a big venture for Me to marry.
Actually, I did not need it at all. But as

00:01:14.542 --> 00:01:21.062
you know in India, they won't spare any girl
from marriage, and they have been after My

00:01:21.062 --> 00:01:28.062
life since I was about eighteen years of age.
So somehow I managed. But I was in the medical

00:01:28.152 --> 00:01:37.251
college Lahore, and suddenly the disturbances
broke out there, of a very serious nature.

00:01:37.362 --> 00:01:43.122
And I came back, and there was no possibility
of My going back. Then the whole thing -- planned,

00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:51.070
I think Divine planned it for My marriage,
because I had to accept them. And as My husband

00:01:51.142 --> 00:01:58.918
was there, there were many proposals also,
which they chose this one, and I was married.

00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:04.722
In a way arranged, because I had never talked
to him about it, he had not talked to Me,

00:02:04.722 --> 00:02:14.995
but he had seen Me once before.
So, for Me it was all right because everybody's

00:02:15.051 --> 00:02:25.361
so much worried in My family about My marriage
all the time. But all throughout I feel that

00:02:25.482 --> 00:02:30.821
I looked after My husband's relations, family,
though he had none. He had only one sister

00:02:30.821 --> 00:02:38.958
whose grandson is Vinay. And all the rest
of the family, all those relations of his,

00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:45.181
I really looked after them. And he was counting,
he said, "You have looked after thirty-five

00:02:45.181 --> 00:02:53.914
nephews," only nephews and how many nieces
and how many ... Because it was nature, you

00:02:54.001 --> 00:03:00.541
see, of compassion, which all they were this
time, worried about all these people.

00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:07.954
My mother's family was always well off. They
didn't need any help anywhere. These people

00:03:08.151 --> 00:03:16.249
were big landlords, once upon a time, all
My husband's relationship, and suddenly this

00:03:16.391 --> 00:03:22.401
was removed, all landlordship was removed
from them, suddenly. And they became absolutely

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:28.661
lost, their children became lost, you see,
because they were used to such luxuries, this,

00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:40.365
that, and they had silver, gold, everything.
And as soon as they lost their lands, they

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:47.001
lost, only fifty acres were allowed for every
family. So they had to sell out all their

00:03:47.001 --> 00:03:55.461
silvers and everything, and they had to be
really adjusted now to a much poorer strata.

00:03:55.611 --> 00:04:06.188
The whole situation came as a very big shock
to all of us, and it was My husband only who

00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:11.232
was well placed in life because he had never
bothered about his lands and things. So he

00:04:11.232 --> 00:04:16.302
was well placed, he was in the government.
So I took the responsibility of all these

00:04:16.302 --> 00:04:25.894
people and tried to help them in their education,
in their finding jobs and things like that.

00:04:26.001 --> 00:04:31.482
It's all worked, and they are all very well
off now. So very happy to see them. They all

00:04:31.482 --> 00:04:39.904
came for the wedding of My granddaughter,
and also of My daughters, and showed their

00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:46.211
gratitude. Out of them very few have come
to Sahaja Yoga. Actually, the relations are

00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:52.501
always like that. They are so close that I
tell them there's a black point, you know,

00:04:52.501 --> 00:04:57.292
where everything dissolves into zero. So they
are so close that they cannot see what is

00:04:57.292 --> 00:05:02.692
Sahaja Yoga. They have tremendous regard for
Me. They have tremendous respect for Me. They'll

00:05:02.692 --> 00:05:07.172
do anything, specially My husband has spent
lot of money in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:07.172 --> 00:05:14.052
quite a lot. And doesn't ask for it; or never
mentioned it also. And we have spent so much

00:05:14.052 --> 00:05:21.052
of his money because we had a joint account;
he never questioned Me, nothing of the kind.

00:05:21.092 --> 00:05:42.441
Very sweet of him. [Suddenly it comes up,
I don't know why. I've been talking too much.]

00:05:42.602 --> 00:05:50.851
So the situation is better now. They have
faith in Sahaja Yoga. They try to meditate

00:05:50.982 --> 00:05:57.121
also. But they are not seekers, in a way,
because they are so close to Me. As you people

00:05:57.121 --> 00:06:07.203
have an advantage, great advantage you have
-- that firstly you are seekers from ages,

00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:13.931
and you understand how important it is to
get your Self-realization, because you feel

00:06:13.931 --> 00:06:19.271
lost without it. You think that if you don't
get your Self-realization, you should commit

00:06:19.271 --> 00:06:25.061
suicide, and there are many letters I have
got saying that "We were mad. We were seeking,

00:06:25.061 --> 00:06:30.862
going to this person, going to that person."
Such big, big letters I got from them how

00:06:30.862 --> 00:06:35.251
they were cheated, how they were tortured,
and how they were ... spent money and how

00:06:35.251 --> 00:06:43.654
they were completely lynched by these gurus.
Some of them had to sell their houses, and

00:06:43.732 --> 00:06:51.970
children were removed from schools, and everybody
became extremely poor. So this was in London

00:06:52.021 --> 00:06:58.412
much worse. Later on I found that every country
has this problem, they became drug addicts

00:06:58.412 --> 00:07:05.910
and all that.
Despite all that now we have so many people

00:07:06.042 --> 00:07:12.072
who are Sahaja yogis all over the world, not
only in Australia. But Australia has quite

00:07:12.072 --> 00:07:20.265
a lot of Sahaja yogis, I must say. And quantity
is very, very large and good, and people are

00:07:20.362 --> 00:07:28.259
nice, but we have had, as I told you, a very
bumpy start. Because of that, certain conditionings

00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:37.559
are built up in people. But now we have to
see that our quality has to improve. Quality

00:07:37.612 --> 00:07:48.672
has to improve, and the test of quality, I
think, is that they are very anxious to do

00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:54.531
whatever is possible for Sahaja Yoga. Whenever
it's possible, whatever is possible, they

00:07:54.531 --> 00:08:06.201
are anxious to do it. And also, they run a
very good family, children, household. This

00:08:06.431 --> 00:08:13.431
is the sign that you have really developed
in Sahaja Yoga. But if that is not so, then

00:08:13.452 --> 00:08:20.072
you will never enjoy the progress Sahaja Yoga
is making.

00:08:20.072 --> 00:08:25.241
I have seen people, one person can give realization
to one thousand. But there's one person who

00:08:25.241 --> 00:08:29.372
has been in Sahaja Yoga, say, about twenty
years, has not given realization to even one

00:08:29.372 --> 00:08:36.372
person. So we have two types, two extremes,
I should -- two extremes, from one to another.

00:08:37.852 --> 00:08:42.092
Now some people believe that they are very
old Sahaja yogis. This is another mistake

00:08:42.092 --> 00:08:46.422
we commit. They believe, "We are the senior."
There's nothing like seniority, juniority

00:08:46.422 --> 00:08:53.182
in Sahaja Yoga. I find sometimes very new
people are such great Sahaja yogis. Very new.

00:08:53.182 --> 00:09:03.396
They just go down, absolutely, into the essence
of themselves and of Sahaja Yoga. Maybe their

00:09:03.452 --> 00:09:11.152
previous lives must have been so great, possibly,
or maybe this life they have achieved something

00:09:11.252 --> 00:09:24.272
great maybe from the parents or from somebody.
But some of them are really very, very deep.

00:09:24.392 --> 00:09:31.222
One of the things I have seen in, mostly in
Sahaja Yoga, that they are more concerned

00:09:31.222 --> 00:09:39.959
about themselves, about their families, about
their children, at the most. But look at Me,

00:09:40.142 --> 00:09:45.532
I'm not ... I never bother about My health.
If anybody asks Me, "How are You?" I said,

00:09:45.532 --> 00:09:52.302
"I am first class." I never bother about Myself
for anything, for My comfort, or for anything,

00:09:52.302 --> 00:10:00.215
food, anything. I have no sense at all to
divert My attention inward. But if somebody

00:10:00.332 --> 00:10:09.889
else, say, is in trouble or has something,
I just, just feel I must help that person.

00:10:09.962 --> 00:10:16.152
I must do something about him, I'm very concerned.
Sometimes also, My family people said that

00:10:16.152 --> 00:10:21.402
"Even if You have one thousand concerns that
You have for others, You'll be better off."

00:10:21.402 --> 00:10:31.885
But that's why nothing, nothing can harm Me
because I am always worried about your progress,

00:10:32.032 --> 00:10:43.852
about your problems, about your quarrels and
fights, and this and that. It's such a tremendous

00:10:43.962 --> 00:10:54.964
concern it is, such a full-throated, you can
say -- absolutely all My attention just goes

00:10:55.012 --> 00:11:00.092
focused on these problems.
As soon as I see person, I know what the problem

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:08.872
the person has, why is he not progressing,
what is the problem he has with others. Everything

00:11:08.952 --> 00:11:19.052
I know in no time. But even if I know, I need
not bother; but I really get very much bothered

00:11:19.202 --> 00:11:25.952
about them, as if -- they are, as it is you
know, part and parcel of My body -- but the

00:11:25.952 --> 00:11:36.655
amount I worry about them, sometimes. People
have always remarked about Me sometimes that

00:11:36.832 --> 00:11:42.052
"Mother, You need not worry so much about
them. Why are You worried? Let them go to

00:11:42.052 --> 00:11:49.052
hell. Let them." If you have once called Me
"Mother," then I really forgive. I've forgiven

00:11:49.322 --> 00:11:54.962
all the people who have troubled Me and have
insulted Me, and given trouble in Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:54.962 --> 00:12:01.962
I've forgiven all of them. I have no time
to worry about not forgiving.

00:12:03.412 --> 00:12:11.928
I should be an example for you, for you to
understand that the more attention we pay

00:12:11.992 --> 00:12:18.992
to others, not finding their faults or criticizing
them, but doing things for others; small,

00:12:19.382 --> 00:12:26.382
small nice things if you start doing for others,
immediately, you will be surprised, your attention

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:34.667
will sharpen. It will have a very great effect.
Sahaja Yoga will spread through you and you

00:12:34.732 --> 00:12:42.420
will, yourself, will be very different person.
You won't criticize other Sahaja yogis, you

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:46.822
won't criticize this, that. I mean fundamental
things, if there's something wrong, you have

00:12:46.822 --> 00:12:56.640
to tell Me. That's different. But that seldom
people tell Me. So first we must extend our

00:12:56.782 --> 00:13:04.819
attention outside, towards others, not towards
ourselves. Then the same about our children,

00:13:04.852 --> 00:13:09.382
our house, our this, that. Just extend your
attention outside.

00:13:09.382 --> 00:13:19.742
Now see, I am a housewife. The last twenty-four
years I have been traveling. And in a way

00:13:19.782 --> 00:13:26.762
you can say I am neglecting My family. But
if you ask My family people, they'll say -- today

00:13:26.762 --> 00:13:34.298
they telephoned to Me to thank Me that I have
completely built up this family. I don't know

00:13:34.392 --> 00:13:42.358
when did I give time to them, but they feel
that way, very much. And everybody thanked

00:13:42.412 --> 00:13:48.982
Me, every one of them said, "This family has
been built up only by You, without You nothing

00:13:48.982 --> 00:13:59.303
could have been possible." Because of My attention
outside is so easy to work out anything that

00:13:59.372 --> 00:14:04.182
is needed to be done. Whatever needed to be
done is done.

00:14:04.182 --> 00:14:13.106
I'll give an example. You may call it a miracle.
My grandson wanted to go to a university,

00:14:13.152 --> 00:14:20.152
good university in America. But they said,
"You have to appear for SAT, and after that

00:14:20.352 --> 00:14:26.052
only we'll admit," and he would lose one year
for that. I didn't want him to go to America

00:14:26.052 --> 00:14:32.792
before doing SAT, because I thought that,
see for six, seven days he goes there, he

00:14:32.792 --> 00:14:39.792
won't be able to do much. And we left it at
that. All right, he was preparing for SAT.

00:14:41.512 --> 00:14:47.222
I had told one Sahaja yogi there, Paul, that
"You see if you can help us." But nobody would

00:14:47.222 --> 00:14:50.412
talk to him in the university, when he went
there, they wouldn't even say if they have

00:14:50.412 --> 00:14:57.914
received the form of My grandson.
The other day they rang up to say that he's

00:14:58.142 --> 00:15:06.300
got admission already. How? God knows. The
information has come that he's got admission.

00:15:06.412 --> 00:15:13.412
Nobody in America can be admitted without
SAT exams. Without any condition he got admission,

00:15:16.222 --> 00:15:21.912
and they told Me.
I said, "Maybe Paul must have done something."

00:15:21.912 --> 00:15:27.102
So I telephoned to Paul. He said, "Mother
I did not go to that university. I didn't

00:15:27.102 --> 00:15:33.682
ask anybody, they wouldn't talk to me. They
said you better not ring here, get lost."

00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:44.010
And somehow, they don't know how, they admitted
him. And he was a last minute person who sent

00:15:44.122 --> 00:15:47.952
the form to this.
But only thing, one thing had happened, he

00:15:47.952 --> 00:15:54.692
told Me that "If I don't get admission in
a good university, I will not go to America.

00:15:54.692 --> 00:16:01.692
It's too much waste of money." Very wise boy.
I said, "All right." That's the only time

00:16:02.022 --> 00:16:10.925
I gave bandhan. And see now, he's got his
admission. His elder sister also got admission

00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:17.032
in John Hopkins Institute without any condition.
Though when she went there, she found the

00:16:17.032 --> 00:16:20.922
atmosphere was no good for her, she ran away.
But on the whole, that unconditional, they

00:16:20.922 --> 00:16:24.492
are saying, Gregoire told Me, "Mother, not
possible. How can she get it?"

00:16:24.492 --> 00:16:33.837
I said, "There's a letter." Without putting
any pressure, without doing anything, it happens.

00:16:33.872 --> 00:16:43.557
It's a miracle. I must say it's a miracle.
But something works, and that is this all-pervading

00:16:43.592 --> 00:16:53.851
power.
With one idea if you go about, it will not

00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:59.982
help you. If you want ... Someone said, "Mother,
we wanted to get this house, we couldn't get

00:16:59.982 --> 00:17:06.612
it." Because you had only one idea, to get
the house. But if you had the whole idea that

00:17:06.612 --> 00:17:14.087
if we get the house, then we'll do these things,
we can work it out better, this, that, then

00:17:14.202 --> 00:17:25.247
you get it. So, you should project yourself
towards other things which are more important

00:17:25.422 --> 00:17:33.583
than yourself. Then suddenly you will start
growing. It's like some trees grow higher,

00:17:33.642 --> 00:17:43.612
some do not. Why? Because they aspire the
sun's light and they want to be more nearer

00:17:43.692 --> 00:17:50.572
to sun. But that's not possible, you cannot
be nearer the sun by just growing few feet.

00:17:50.572 --> 00:17:57.866
But they aspire. So they are taller than others.
In the same group, you'll find, some trees

00:17:57.942 --> 00:18:11.792
grow taller, some don't.
So, one aspect is that you have to meditate,

00:18:11.872 --> 00:18:27.297
no doubt. So, one thing is to develop quality
you have to meditate. That I said. But you

00:18:27.382 --> 00:18:34.132
must know what is your problem. You are right-sided
or left-sided. It's very important to know

00:18:34.132 --> 00:18:40.432
whether you are right-sided or left-sided.
Now some people have problems which are left-sided.

00:18:40.432 --> 00:19:00.614
All right, they start doing water treatment.
There was doctor in Delhi, Dr. Nigam, you

00:19:00.682 --> 00:19:08.234
must be knowing him. He had, I had cured his
paralysis. I was surprised that his left hand

00:19:08.352 --> 00:19:14.782
was still not working out properly.
So I asked him, "What sort of a meditation

00:19:14.782 --> 00:19:20.752
you do?"
He said, "With the light and with the water."

00:19:20.752 --> 00:19:25.842
I said, "What? You are doing both?"
"Yes."

00:19:25.842 --> 00:19:32.842
I said, "What, what's wrong with you is right
side [Shri Mataji corrects] -- left side.

00:19:33.002 --> 00:19:39.182
So you should just do candle treatment. Just
drop it." I said it to him. Just when I said

00:19:39.182 --> 00:19:45.872
it to him, his hand started opening out. I
said it only; becomes like a mantra I think.

00:19:45.872 --> 00:19:51.102
Started opening, he has opened his hand.
So about treatment also you must understand

00:19:51.102 --> 00:19:57.602
what treatment you must take. Now some people
are left-sided. They should take left side

00:19:57.602 --> 00:20:04.062
treatment only. There should be no confusion.
So I said, "Who told you this?"

00:20:04.062 --> 00:20:08.752
He said, "Everybody said the same thing."
I said, "What did they say?"

00:20:08.752 --> 00:20:15.742
"That you can take this."
In Sahaja Yoga there are certain rules and

00:20:15.742 --> 00:20:20.482
regulations of the Divine. So now if you are
suffering from the left, you just take treatment

00:20:20.482 --> 00:20:27.482
for left. No water treatment, at all. Now
you are suffering from the right, then don't

00:20:27.542 --> 00:20:33.891
take the candle treatment at all, at all.
These are two sides which are to be corrected,

00:20:33.891 --> 00:20:39.112
then you are in the center.
When you feel you are in center, you can use

00:20:39.112 --> 00:20:47.169
both the things. But that is normally very
few, I've seen. Normally you find very few

00:20:47.242 --> 00:20:54.242
people who have this central point. If they
have, they should do this treatment. But there

00:20:54.712 --> 00:20:59.672
is no need to do treatment once you are in
the center. But you have to meditate. So you

00:20:59.672 --> 00:21:05.282
can sit before the photograph. But to take
out all your conditionings and things, or

00:21:05.282 --> 00:21:12.282
may be the day's problem, you can sit before
the photograph with a candle as well as water.

00:21:12.822 --> 00:21:21.651
But the ones who are not, should not. And
one should not feel also bad if the leaders

00:21:21.742 --> 00:21:29.595
tell them, "You are left-sided or right-sided."
The problem is that in Sahaja Yoga there are

00:21:29.692 --> 00:21:37.955
leaders. It's a myth. It's a myth. It's not
something so seriously to be taken. But these

00:21:38.042 --> 00:21:46.241
leaders are there because I cannot communicate
with all of you. So, they are there. When

00:21:46.272 --> 00:21:54.591
it came to talk about the leaders, nobody
told Me anything. Very surprising. Never they

00:21:54.752 --> 00:22:02.415
told Me the leaders are doing like this. I
had to discover it every time I came here.

00:22:02.512 --> 00:22:07.902
You should have written to Me earlier that
our leader is like this or it's happening

00:22:07.902 --> 00:22:14.902
here. There's no harm in writing that. But
they did not, none of them. Till I came here,

00:22:16.262 --> 00:22:20.042
I discovered the kind of people they were.
Actually, they dis ... I discovered them only

00:22:20.042 --> 00:22:26.092
in Europe. I did not know that they were doing
all these things.

00:22:26.092 --> 00:22:34.422
Then they were developing also some funds
and raising some sort of a money, nobody told

00:22:34.492 --> 00:22:41.825
Me. Even when they came to India they collected
money. But nobody told Me that they were collecting

00:22:41.912 --> 00:22:47.512
money for this or that. I mean, at least you
should have told Me. Somebody should have

00:22:47.512 --> 00:22:55.485
told Me. That's how they became sort of absolutely
fascists. They thought, "We are the lords,

00:22:55.622 --> 00:23:01.452
we can do whatever we like." But for other
nonsensical things they'll write such letters,

00:23:01.452 --> 00:23:10.991
but never about something which is very, very
good, essential and needed. And anybody who

00:23:11.001 --> 00:23:17.481
writes Me like that, I'm very much thankful
to that person. Not just to criticize but

00:23:17.522 --> 00:23:27.271
to give exact trouble, or exact problem that
is facing. I'll be very happy if you people

00:23:27.338 --> 00:23:38.098
write to Me truthfully, not what is troubling
you, but what is troubling everyone. So I

00:23:38.179 --> 00:23:56.169
can solve the problem much better, isn't it?
Now the another thing we had to tell about,

00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:08.860
that what should be the relationships of husband
and wife. Now I've already had many occasions

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:17.308
to talk to them. Now you are married by Me.
It was not such an arranged ma ... arranged

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:22.960
marriage, you were given time to find out
till the end. And even if you did not like

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:28.519
the person, you could have told Me and we
would have finished the marriage. But even

00:24:28.519 --> 00:24:35.519
when it is registered, you've stayed with
the lady for so many years, or with the man

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:40.970
for so many years, you have had children and
after that suddenly you come up that "Mother

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:50.153
we cannot cope." But this is going too far
with yourself and with the whole society of

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:55.640
Sahaja Yoga. If you don't like somebody, if
there's a problem you should find out in the

00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:02.640
beginning. I'll be the last person to force
you to marry anyone. Even if you are married,

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:09.899
and just after say three, four months you
let Me know, the marriage can be broken. And

00:25:09.899 --> 00:25:16.899
I have told Yogi now not to register them
for about three months and see for yourself.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:23.880
Now you must understand that marriage is not
an institution well-practiced in the West.

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:30.740
Till they are married, they are happy. As
soon as they are married there's something

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:36.630
goes wrong in their heads. Maybe the reason
is there's a legal bondage in the marriage.

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:41.370
If you are married to somebody, you see, your
money will be shared or anything, that kind

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:49.667
of a fear is there. For the same reason I
have asked so many times that you don't get

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:59.917
married to somebody till you are normal. But
many people who are sick, have diseases, have

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:10.171
problems, have some sort of funny ideas, just
they marry, as the Americans say, for the

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:22.181
heck of it. And then it's such a troublesome
thing for Me. Firstly I get concerned, secondly

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:29.300
it's a very bad example for other Sahaja yogis,
and brings a bad name for all of us.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:38.880
It's not difficult to enjoy your marriage
because mostly we really examine and find

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:48.791
out properly what's the matter with what,
and who is capable of carrying on with whom.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:58.271
We, we try our level best, but there are sometimes
four hundred, five hundred applications of

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:09.707
various types. Sometimes you do miss, do miss
certain points. But you people can understand

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:22.780
that, sometimes, and you should try to help
Me by understanding that what is it after

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:30.918
all? What is so important?
There was a Sahaja yogi, very good Sahaja

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:36.910
yogi from England. He had a wife who was really
beautiful wife, very well educated, this,

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:42.660
that, very smart. He came to Me, he said,
"Mother I want absolutely to divorce this

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:46.220
woman."
I said, "Why? She is so good looking."

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:53.220
He said, "No I don't want. I want to divorce."
He was after Me. Then I talked to her. She

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:57.510
said, "I also want to divorce."
"All right, divorce. Divorce is allowed in

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:05.240
Sahaja Yoga." So they divorced each other.
Then, we were showing him different photographs

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:11.490
and things that "Now tell Me, which one would
you like to marry?" So he chose a girl who

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:20.790
is not well educated, who is not by any means
good looking. She is very dark with very thick

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:28.310
lips and all that. But I love her very much.
I like her very much. She is very lovable

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:35.630
person, extremely sweet. So, he chose her.
I was surprised.

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:39.899
I said, "What?"
"Yes Mother. See her vibrations."

00:28:39.899 --> 00:28:46.899
Still I said, "You see her first."
So when we went to Ganapatipule, "Yes," he

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:52.820
said. "This is the one I want to marry." I
was surprised, you see, with all that how

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:59.440
could he say that "I want to marry this girl"?
I said, "Be sure."

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:07.456
"Yes, yes, I'm very sure, I want to marry."
What he told Me that "She's tranquility personified.

00:29:07.889 --> 00:29:17.256
I feel so tranquil." She is full of vibrations,
like bag of vibrations. I know that. But I

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:22.230
didn't know how this fellow has felt it. He
has just fallen in love with her, I tell you.

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:28.730
And he says, "She is the most beautiful person
I have met." He doesn't see anything else

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:36.500
that is outside. Later on My own sister said,
"What have You done? What a match!"

00:29:36.690 --> 00:29:43.690
So I looked at that girl, and then I started
seeing these points that she's not good looking,

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:51.040
she's not this, but what he said -- she's
tranquility. She is just tranquility. He went

00:29:51.290 --> 00:29:58.010
to her village all the way, and he met all
his family and everybody was surprised, such

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:06.080
a handsome looking Englishman of all the things.
And she said [Shri Mataji corrects] he said,

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:14.359
"Mother, she has neutralized all my nonsensical
points. She's so beautiful." And he's really

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:21.420
in love with her.
So that is a sign of a very deep Sahaja yogi

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:29.644
that they don't go after superficial things.
She cooks South Indian food, he loves it.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:39.264
Whatever she does he loves. He cares for her
very much. And she is neither left-sided,

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:46.701
nor right-sided, she is in the center. So
both of them match each other because spiritually

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:56.741
they are on the same level, very deep, and
that is what we have to be. If we are not

00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:06.430
spiritually matched, then the problem comes
in. We have to have proper matching of vibrations.

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:10.960
Of course, we see to it when we marry, I mean
can you imagine, ninety-nine percent marriages

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:17.960
have been successful. And some of the marriages
were mischievously done I know, there were

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:30.881
some mischiefs. But still they have worked
out. Still they are happy people. But some

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:38.340
people are bent upon making their marriage
a problem. Some of them, extremely egoistical,

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:48.272
think no end of themselves, and start making
everybody miserable. What makes them so much

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:57.688
full of ego, I don't know. And they just spoil
their marriages. They become unhappy themselves,

00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:07.558
and they make others also unhappy. Now My
husband has never been a Sahaja yogi, never.

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:15.542
Even now, I wouldn't say he is a Sahaja yogi.
Even now. I don't know. But I knew how to

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:24.612
handle him and how to work it out. And I've
managed very well, and he also knows. Always

00:32:24.759 --> 00:32:34.898
he says, "You are very moral person; You are
a very noble person." All those things he

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:45.438
says to Me. And all, you see, his saying is
like this that "You are, but You cannot make

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:47.680
others."
I said, "I can, why not?"

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:55.134
First he could not believe that I could transform
people. And now he knows I have transformed.

00:32:55.259 --> 00:33:02.259
He said, "They have become angels." And so
that you are now angels.

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:11.902
I am not very happy with the crèche you have
here, not at all. It's a mess. And I don't

00:33:12.019 --> 00:33:19.782
know but it's a -- the children coming out
of this school are racist. Very racial ideas

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:30.125
they have, that's the report Yogi gave Me.
Not about Rome. It is so. So I would say we

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:36.030
should teach, change the teachers, is the
best way. And the children are very aggressive

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:43.030
when they come, very harsh. I would say, put
some Indian teachers there instead of some

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:48.530
Western teachers. Maybe they are racist or
maybe something wrong there. This is the report

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:55.160
I have got about your children, Australian
children create more problems, and it's very

00:33:55.160 --> 00:34:02.160
difficult, and they are racist. But there
are hardly any Indian children there, you

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:10.198
see. But if there's one even, they aggress.
There are, I think, only three children who

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:18.500
I think are Indians only, or one may be a
Negro, I don't know. But all these children

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:25.100
just jump on them when they go from here.
Takes time to change their ideas.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:29.960
If you are racist you cannot be in Sahaja
Yoga, you understand that. We don't believe

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:34.720
in race and religion and all these things
which are separating human beings from one

00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:45.586
to another. That is our ideal, that we cannot
have this kind of a nonsense in our society.

00:34:45.709 --> 00:34:52.570
And be careful. Watch your children, how they
react to black people. Specially for Australian

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:59.499
children it is being pointed out. So I think
there's something wrong with some people here.

00:34:59.499 --> 00:35:07.766
They should just try to find out if we are
by any chance trying to teach them that white

00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:15.296
skin is better than the black.
As I told you in the lecture, I hope you have

00:35:15.389 --> 00:35:23.466
listened to what I said about the genes. That
it is now found out that two protective genes

00:35:23.629 --> 00:35:32.712
that Asians have the white skin don't have
at all. One of them is the right side, another

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:42.600
the left side. So a white skin will take to
a violence much more easily than an Asian.

00:35:42.679 --> 00:35:52.209
Asian actually means now Indians and Chinese.
Culturally they are the same. Now that means,

00:35:52.319 --> 00:35:58.530
after coming to Sahaja Yoga, your genes have
been transformed, and you have protective

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:07.787
genes within you. And one of them is, as I
told you, is the right-sided, hate people

00:36:07.839 --> 00:36:13.740
and kill people, be violent, this racialism,
which is now coming back again because they

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:20.740
will take to it easily because there's no
protection against it. Now you can see in

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:28.802
My own family, we had eleven children. Some
were fair, very fair; some were dark. We never

00:36:28.909 --> 00:36:35.760
knew what is racialism is because the skin
is so, I mean, is skin deep as they say.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:43.676
So, you see, the ...you are now confronted,
you must understand that, with these two horrible

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:48.889
genes, by which, one that will take you to
violence, take you to temper, will take you

00:36:48.889 --> 00:36:58.583
to this kind of racialism and hatred and fundamentalism
and the another one is indulgences, laziness

00:36:58.659 --> 00:37:08.583
or serious things like sex and this and that,
and all these habits you develop of drugs.

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:17.549
So you have to be very careful now. By just
announcing that, Germans announced that "We

00:37:17.619 --> 00:37:23.159
are a white race," you see, "we are higher
than anyone." How are they higher? Just imagine.

00:37:23.159 --> 00:37:30.509
They killed little, little children, small
little children into a gas chamber and saw

00:37:30.639 --> 00:37:36.169
them being burnt. Can you imagine anybody
who is a evolved soul, or who is a higher

00:37:36.169 --> 00:37:48.591
race, will do such a nasty thing like that?
But this is ... they have sort of self-proportioned

00:37:48.740 --> 00:38:01.177
values and virtues, which they don't have.
They were so horrible that they took the fat

00:38:01.270 --> 00:38:14.340
from the dead bodies in Poland, Warsaw, and
they had bath with it. Like a soap, they used.

00:38:14.439 --> 00:38:21.945
So grotesque. Whole thing is so horrifying.
And they think they are very, very great races.

00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:27.459
Even Max Muller wrote like that, you see.
He said it's the Germans who came to India

00:38:27.459 --> 00:38:35.765
and wrote Vedas. Their forefathers cannot
write Vedas.

00:38:35.859 --> 00:38:41.740
So now try to understand that what we are
facing basically. What I feel, in the arrogance

00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:51.381
of this white skin, these people crossed over
their limitations, their maryadas -- the forefathers.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:39:00.046
Like the way the Spanish went to America.
You can't find one aboriginal person there,

00:39:00.189 --> 00:39:07.916
not one. I wanted to see in Chile, in Argentina,
in Brazil, not even one. Where are they lost?

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:16.951
They all went to the hills and some of them
are preserved in Bolivia and all that. And

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:26.411
the revenge has started. From Bolivia all
these horrible drugs are coming. And the whole

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:38.026
of America is just crushed with that. There's
no wisdom, just to think you have fair skin.

00:39:38.169 --> 00:39:44.990
All right, go ahead. Where are you going?
You see these. What about the Americans? Where

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:53.172
are they going? Now they are concerned, little
bit. But sixty-five percent people may get

00:39:53.270 --> 00:40:00.802
schizophrenia in that country. Now how can
you be satisfied with yourself when you see

00:40:00.889 --> 00:40:06.319
all these things happening, because you have
just a white skin?

00:40:06.319 --> 00:40:16.504
So first thing you must try to understand
that even if there's a trace of racialism

00:40:16.599 --> 00:40:26.784
in you, better throw it away. On the contrary,
I think this country has really, real justice

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:33.810
for racists. Justice-wise you must say Australians
know to be really a multicultural society,

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:45.319
and they understand the value of it: what
you have gained through multicultural societies.

00:40:45.439 --> 00:40:52.199
There's so many things to be learned, that
they are very clean, outside, not in personal

00:40:52.199 --> 00:40:57.579
life. They'll keep the house very clean, the
carpets very clean, everything very clean,

00:40:57.579 --> 00:41:03.010
but as far as themselves are concerned, they
are not so clean. Of course, now with Sahaja

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:08.300
Yoga you are changed, I am not saying.
But I know of English people, they would not

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:16.121
take bath for months, months, they used to
smell like hell. And when My husband was there

00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:22.240
we used to shake hands, and the hands would
smell for days together. We used to put scent,

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:28.559
attar, this, that, but still. Using paper,
paper, it's all right because it is very cold,

00:41:28.559 --> 00:41:37.184
but it's not that cold. We have lived in England
for so many years. We always use water and

00:41:37.369 --> 00:41:44.369
running water. In the same tub, three, four
people take bath, to save pounds. The only

00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:52.870
mantra they know is "save pounds". Same here,
people are extremely money-oriented when they

00:41:52.949 --> 00:42:04.997
have so much money compared to others. So,
for Sahaja yogis, is important that you should

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:13.617
be frugal and you should not be miserly. You
need not. But you should be clean inside.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:19.510
That's very important, not outside so much
because see all these diseases are coming,

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:23.429
these things are coming, one has to be very
careful.

00:42:23.429 --> 00:42:28.899
Secondly, you are so protective of yourself,
I mean you are always thinking about yourself.

00:42:28.899 --> 00:42:35.589
Extremely protective. So you do not develop
any immunity to anything. If you have to travel

00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:40.109
like Me, you would get sick within one month's
time. Firstly you can't eat anything, you

00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:46.709
get hepatitis. If you smell something you
get hay fever. You do that, I mean all these

00:42:46.709 --> 00:42:53.270
things are coming because of over-protectiveness.
You must make your children to play in sand;

00:42:53.270 --> 00:43:01.173
you must make them go about. No -- so protective
of your children! So when they grow they cannot

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:14.033
stand anything which is absolutely not completely,
we can say, covered. But Indians don't get

00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:21.089
it. We are full of parasites, full of mosquitoes,
full of this. Australian children, when they

00:43:21.099 --> 00:43:28.583
got bitten by mosquitoes, they got malaria.
But the whole city was there, nobody got malaria.

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:34.720
Not one person. Now they were surprised, how
is it these boys and girls have got malaria?

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:43.599
So in childhood, we should not make our children
sort of all the time extremely delicate. You

00:43:43.669 --> 00:43:53.682
look all right. I mean, might have good muscles
to look at. But you are very, very vulnerable

00:43:53.780 --> 00:44:00.089
to any disease. You can see from your children.
I'm not saying about Australians. All the

00:44:00.089 --> 00:44:08.079
people from the West, whether they are Americans
or they are Europeans or they are this. But

00:44:08.179 --> 00:44:16.029
I've seen Russia, people are very, very good.
They don't catch much. They don't suffer from

00:44:16.199 --> 00:44:22.780
all this.
So this over-protectiveness, and also there

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:28.000
are books and books. Today they'll write a
book about children, "You must give them feed

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.109
at the right time." Then they will write next
time, "No, no you should not do that way.

00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:40.800
You should allow them to eat whatever they
like." Then thirdly they'll say that "You

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.010
should not give this to your children, that
you should not give, that should not happen."

00:44:44.010 --> 00:44:54.581
With all this knowledge, people are not aware
that they are making their children like the

00:44:54.859 --> 00:45:01.760
dolls in the hands of these writers. Whatever
they say, whatever they do, there's no sense

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:08.389
in it. We know what is needed for the children
in Sahaja Yoga. Actually these are people

00:45:08.389 --> 00:45:12.040
just selling their books, you know, whatever
knowledge they have, they have a flair to

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:19.040
write, they write it and you accept it and
you get into problems. And this is a very,

00:45:19.339 --> 00:45:26.329
very common thing. They protect the children
too much which they need not. But whenever

00:45:26.329 --> 00:45:34.177
it is necessary one should.
My main thing is that before the children

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:42.097
how we should behave. There are differences
in husband and wife, not that there are none.

00:45:42.179 --> 00:45:49.129
But they should not be exposed. Children should
not be exposed to your differences, to your

00:45:49.129 --> 00:45:55.129
fights, to your angers and fits. They get
it; they are so, I am again saying, they are

00:45:55.129 --> 00:46:02.691
so protected. So much protection is given
to them. These protected children take these

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:11.185
things very quickly. If mother says to the
father something, father says to the mother,

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:17.550
they'll repeat it later on. You will be surprised,
same thing. When the father does something,

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:26.860
they'll say same thing. So you are spoiling
their whole attitude towards life. Must understand,

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:38.560
children are much faster than you are in picking
up things because they have to learn, they

00:46:38.619 --> 00:46:43.990
are growing up.
So your relationship between you and your

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:56.221
wife should be of respect, should be of love
and understanding and caring. But there should

00:46:56.359 --> 00:47:09.089
not be something of ... some sort of a scene
that is not good for them. I mean, that doesn't

00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:16.069
mean that you behave in a funny manner before
the children. That is for the bedroom, all

00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:22.099
right? Thank God, you have bedrooms separate.
We don't even have that. In India, very few

00:47:22.099 --> 00:47:29.451
people have bedrooms closed. In the day time,
if they close bedrooms, people think, "Are

00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:37.717
they mad or sick?" So this is the attitude
that one has to take that before others, before

00:47:37.809 --> 00:47:46.097
other people, before the children and everything,
we have to behave. Now if you want to find

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:54.643
faults with each other, you can find it in
the bedroom. That's not a very good game I

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:59.109
think, why should you find? It's always better
to close the chapter at the end of the day

00:47:59.109 --> 00:48:05.809
and sleep well. All this I am telling you
that you should not miss the point of joy

00:48:05.809 --> 00:48:12.530
and happiness. This is how you will really
enjoy your children, your husband, your wife,

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:18.530
everything. In this, as I have always said
that the wife has to be very wise. She's the

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:23.780
one who has to be very wise. But not to such
an extent that she allows her husband to do

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:29.770
what he likes. She has to keep a control,
in a way, that he doesn't disturb the society

00:48:29.801 --> 00:48:40.911
of Sahaja Yoga.
About other things, like we have about, they

00:48:40.924 --> 00:48:47.271
said, I didn't know that you are paying some
money for the school and all those people

00:48:47.414 --> 00:48:58.044
who are not even having children in the school
are paying. I didn't know this. School has

00:48:58.059 --> 00:49:03.119
money, no doubt. There's no problem on that
because they are not spending much. But now

00:49:03.169 --> 00:49:10.929
you change the pattern. I'll talk to your
leader, and see. And also you can have a proper

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:18.969
house on rent, separately and get all the
children there to study, and nobody should

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:26.689
act arbitrarily. And it should be done properly.
I'll talk to your leader and tell him. And

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:35.260
the children should be seen, even by the leaders,
to see that they don't become racist or they

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:43.340
do not become violent. And I think Indian
teachers would be a better idea, because you

00:49:43.369 --> 00:49:50.070
see they, they are mild people and it would
be better. And I have also discovered you

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:55.050
have two girls who can work, Indian girls.
It's better that they should look after the

00:49:55.050 --> 00:50:05.440
children.
And lastly I have to say, I really enjoyed

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:21.840
My stay in Sydney. Really. I don't know why
this was called as Sydney, what was the reason

00:50:21.929 --> 00:50:28.919
-- and also in the West they don't have meaning
for every name. But it's a very beautiful

00:50:28.919 --> 00:50:36.465
place where so many Sahaja yogis are there.
And I really feel very happy in your company.

00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:49.108
I love you and you all love Me. Whatever I
want is your happiness and joy. And please

00:50:49.159 --> 00:50:58.288
remember that we are here to enjoy, all of
us. So don't do anything that makes you unhappy,

00:50:58.359 --> 00:51:04.739
like having big, big plans, this, that. Not
necessary. There's no need, and if you want

00:51:04.739 --> 00:51:11.209
to have you please let Me know. I'll tell
you exactly whether you should do it or not.

00:51:11.209 --> 00:51:18.624
Because I don't want you to land up as bankrupts,
or this and that, like madcap people everywhere.

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:25.459
So this is, you have to be careful, you just
inform Me. You let Me know. You can write

00:51:25.459 --> 00:51:29.570
to Me that you have such plans and all that,
I'll tell you.

00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:34.879
Now this idea of this artist business is,
now that doesn't go into My head, I must say.

00:51:34.879 --> 00:51:38.550
They have told Me that they want to get all
the artists together of the world and this

00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:46.165
and that. It's a very one-sided attitude to
form, you see. Just a few artists are there,

00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:53.250
then they invite them, and they invite here
and a conference start. That sort of a thing

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:57.699
should not be. If there are artists, all right,
there are artists abroad, everywhere they

00:51:57.699 --> 00:52:04.449
are. And wherever you can meet them, you can
meet them. But you cannot separate a body

00:52:04.449 --> 00:52:07.899
like that, artists are separately, musicians
separately, then you'll have politicians,

00:52:07.899 --> 00:52:17.724
then economists, you see.
So that's not Sahaj standard. That's not Sahaj

00:52:17.869 --> 00:52:23.639
Yoga, that's the way people live, you see,
they have separately some sort of a thing,

00:52:23.639 --> 00:52:36.809
or if not, they can have a organization of,
say broomstick women, something like that.

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:41.699
So we are Sahaja yogis, and we are Sahaja
yogis and Sahaja yogis. If you are artists,

00:52:41.699 --> 00:52:47.570
is by the way. If you are musicians, is by
the way. We are Sahaja yogis and Sahaja yogis.

00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:53.629
This is one has to remember. Like this the
groups will start. And this clubbing system

00:52:53.629 --> 00:52:58.800
has been there in the human nature, has been
there through out. We have been clubbing with

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:05.349
anything. You know, if there's somebody like
the French, they put their spoon the other

00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:12.349
way round, you see, spoon and fork like that.
So I said, "Why?"

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:18.669
"Because we're French."
I couldn't understand this explanation, "these

00:53:18.669 --> 00:53:24.530
are French". And then the English put it this
way. Now if you just put it the other way

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:32.831
round, I mean, you are a gone case, then you
are no good. So we have to know that this

00:53:32.909 --> 00:53:38.859
kind of clubbing was in the human nature because
it comes from the animal instinct. You see

00:53:38.859 --> 00:53:45.589
animals also club together. You are from Brisbane?
All right, we sit together. You are from here,

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:52.916
we sit together. It's a animal instinct. Because
of some sort of a fear maybe, that they club

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:57.919
together. This clubbing, clubbing has come
to human race also. For everything you have

00:53:57.919 --> 00:54:03.409
a club, you know that.
For you it is not necessary because you have

00:54:03.409 --> 00:54:11.439
come out of that state of animal instinct
to higher instincts. Yes, you are an artist.

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:16.589
All right, you are an artist. So another is
an artist, all right. But don't club together

00:54:16.589 --> 00:54:23.229
as artists, as musicians, as this, as that.
As long as you have to say sing together,

00:54:23.229 --> 00:54:28.699
you can practice, again finished. It's very
important point. Try to understand. Clubbing

00:54:28.699 --> 00:54:37.920
is not at all a human quality. Clubbing is
a quality of animals. So when we are all Sahaja

00:54:37.979 --> 00:54:44.119
yogis, why should we club together? What is
the need to club? And this clubbing has brought

00:54:44.119 --> 00:54:49.929
so much problem to us. This politicians, then
this religions, and all this nothing but clubbing

00:54:49.929 --> 00:54:58.337
-- that separates. So anytime you find there's
a clubbing system working anywhere, just run

00:54:58.459 --> 00:55:05.459
away from there. You belong to a very big
community. Now say in My hand, these fingers

00:55:05.599 --> 00:55:14.972
start clubbing, what will I do with them?
I'll have to make a club out of it. But still

00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:22.342
going on. I mean when they come to Ganapatipule
there had clubs going on there also. I've

00:55:22.449 --> 00:55:30.578
been informed about them. Australian club,
and north Australian then south Australians,

00:55:30.609 --> 00:55:38.888
then east, west and southeast, southwest,
so all that has to be given up. One has to

00:55:38.969 --> 00:55:44.589
understand that we are all Sahaja yogis, all
over the world, wherever we may live, whatever

00:55:44.589 --> 00:55:53.171
we may eat, whatever we may wear. We are inside
all Sahaja yogis, and all connected to all-pervading

00:55:53.270 --> 00:56:00.621
power. If you become great artistes because
you have got Sahaja Yoga, all right, enjoy

00:56:00.739 --> 00:56:05.510
that. If you became great musicians, all right,
enjoy that. If you become an orator, enjoy

00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:13.407
that. But you don't club yourself with another
person on those grounds. That is something

00:56:13.439 --> 00:56:21.267
not at all Sahaj. In Sahaj you are one with
every one, and with all of them.

00:56:21.319 --> 00:56:27.839
See now, My life if it is anything, you should
understand that I am extremely a sahaj person,

00:56:27.839 --> 00:56:34.219
extremely sahaj. So wherever I go, I can't
understand. I go to Russia, all these Russians,

00:56:34.219 --> 00:56:41.219
they had never known about Me, they have never
heard about Me, they came to listen to Me.

00:56:41.439 --> 00:56:47.270
Anywhere I go. I mean later on the follow
up may not be that good, but wherever I go

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:56.627
there are in thousands of people. After all
what is so great about Me? See this is it.

00:56:56.750 --> 00:57:03.290
What you have to learn -- I am so sahaj and
also when I tell you about, you don't feel

00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:09.989
bad. Because you know, you know I am telling
you out of compassion and love, and that is

00:57:09.989 --> 00:57:16.540
important. You understand that because first
thing is compassion and love. And when there

00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:21.510
is compassion and love, you cannot think of
clubbing at all, never. You can never club

00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:28.050
with anyone. You will love each and every
person, and be kind and enjoy your compassion,

00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:31.010
the virtue of your compassion, virtue of your
love.

00:57:31.010 --> 00:57:38.311
And that is, that shows on your faces, you
shine compared to those born again, who were

00:57:38.399 --> 00:57:50.131
never born again. They were looking so hazard
and horrible, very harsh faces, with such

00:57:50.219 --> 00:57:56.449
a young girl, she had all the wrinkles you
could count on her face, going round and round

00:57:56.449 --> 00:57:59.089
and round.
So I told her, "You are not born again, I

00:57:59.089 --> 00:58:00.629
am sorry."
She said, "Are You?"

00:58:00.629 --> 00:58:06.119
I said, "I am. Look at your face in the mirror.
You will know, you are not born again."

00:58:06.119 --> 00:58:13.119
So the greatest advantage of Sahaja Yoga is
that you can enjoy everything. That is the

00:58:13.359 --> 00:58:22.260
greatest advantage, whether it is art, architecture,
music, or a lecture, or studies, education,

00:58:22.359 --> 00:58:30.159
family life, everything you should be able
to enjoy fully. Then you are a real Sahaja

00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:36.579
yogi and that you have achieved that state.
Sometimes there are problems, here and there,

00:58:36.579 --> 00:58:43.419
something happens, doesn't matter. Have faith,
and you will be surprised at the miracles

00:58:43.419 --> 00:58:53.172
that you get. One after another, so many miracles,
but listen to Me and also try to follow what

00:58:53.270 --> 00:58:59.169
I say.
First of all, no temper. Temper if you have,

00:58:59.169 --> 00:59:04.429
you must know that it's a serious thing in
the West because there's no controlling power

00:59:04.429 --> 00:59:13.574
over temper, and schizophrenia is the only
ultimate result of temper. So temper should

00:59:13.659 --> 00:59:23.521
not be justified. All ego, temper should be
brought down. One should not try in any way

00:59:23.599 --> 00:59:29.079
to get angry with others because of jealousy,
because of complexes, because of anything.

00:59:29.079 --> 00:59:41.257
If it is so, please introspect, "Why do I
get into tempers?" Shri Krishna has placed

00:59:41.339 --> 00:59:46.159
temper as the worst disease of all, He said
from there it rises everything. But I don't

00:59:46.159 --> 00:59:51.500
agree with Him because, you see, it must be,
He was, for Him it's a leela, the whole world

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:59.093
is a leela, but not for everyone. Temper can
come from Mooladhara, can come from Swadishtana,

00:59:59.139 --> 01:00:07.823
can come from anywhere. So one cannot say
that the source of temper is going to be the

01:00:07.889 --> 01:00:15.122
source of all the problems, can be from anything.
One can really get destroyed by anything,

01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:20.379
but temper is one thing that is the worst
of all.

01:00:20.379 --> 01:00:28.222
So, if you find anybody who is hot tempered,
if you find yourself to be hot tempered, then

01:00:28.290 --> 01:00:36.895
please see to it that you overcome it. I used
to tell before, I don't know now, there must

01:00:36.949 --> 01:00:41.659
be My tapes that if you are very angry, then
stand before the mirror and say all kinds

01:00:41.659 --> 01:00:49.325
of things. Or else you take a pillow and hit
it hard when you are in temper. Close the

01:00:49.409 --> 01:00:55.849
door, hit the pillow and then go out. You
may have to spend for another pillow, doesn't

01:00:55.849 --> 01:01:05.425
matter. So you develop a very, I should say,
a pleasing personality. That's very important.

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:19.536
You must have a very pleasing personality.
But that is not acceptable in certain countries

01:01:19.649 --> 01:01:25.829
because it's said that you should not show
your, any pleasing personality, because others

01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:35.269
will think you are weak. The strength is your
joy. Strength is your virtue, strength is

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:42.199
your pleasing personality. That is your strength.
And this artificially, some people say that

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:47.000
if you become very pleasing and this and that,
then others will think you are weak. If they

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:54.505
think, let them think like that. That is their
stupidity. So you should be happy, joyous,

01:01:54.589 --> 01:02:00.300
pleasing.
I must say in Sahaja Yoga some people have

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:08.575
come up so well that I really feel very proud
of them, very proud. And also, I never expected

01:02:08.669 --> 01:02:17.445
this to work out so well in My lifetime, I
never expected because I started it very late,

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:25.128
deliberately. So it is very heartening to
see so many Sahaja yogis coming up, and listening

01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:34.808
to Me so nicely without taking any objection
to what I say, and then imbibing it in their

01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:39.649
lives so that they can enjoy themselves very
well.

01:02:39.649 --> 01:02:49.475
This time I had to meet people separately
and in one room and all, but next time I think

01:02:49.629 --> 01:02:54.699
I'll discuss certain problems openly. If you
people are doing something stupid which, let

01:02:54.699 --> 01:03:01.699
us, all of us know. So that there'll be some
fear of people who are doing wrong things.

01:03:01.939 --> 01:03:11.931
For example, I don't know is he here, Peter
Patten, is he here? He's not here? Peter Patten

01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:23.656
from Adelaide. He has been very funny, and
he has to get out of Sahaja Yoga I think,

01:03:23.719 --> 01:03:31.816
for some time.
Then there's one Mark, is he here? Where is

01:03:31.939 --> 01:03:43.198
he? Just call him. So you see, he doesn't
realize what's wrong with him. And he is trying

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:49.989
to force himself on to others. Is not a very
good idea. You all take a bandhan, I think

01:03:49.989 --> 01:04:07.835
you see, it's all right. Where is he? So we
will have a open talk about it, so you will

01:04:07.959 --> 01:04:23.172
realize what's wrong with the person. Extremely
right-sided is, the whole thing is burning.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:42.425
Where is he? What's the matter with you? Why
do you want to meet Me?

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:46.269
[Mark: I was just going to get some directions
from You, Shri Mataji.]

01:04:46.261 --> 01:04:49.579
What direction?
[Mark: Just about what I should be doing,

01:04:49.597 --> 01:05:03.087
as far as more involvement in ....]
I mean, just think of it, if I have to talk

01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:07.607
to each person like that, what will be My
situation?

01:05:07.657 --> 01:05:13.157
[Mark: Yes Shri Mataji.]
So why should you force your way like that?

01:05:13.157 --> 01:05:19.287
You could have written a letter to Me, I would
have known whatever you wanted. You see, now

01:05:19.306 --> 01:05:25.297
try to understand what's your problem is.
Your problem is right side. All right? Sit

01:05:25.377 --> 01:05:34.211
down and remove it. That's your problem. You
can find it out very easily, what your problem

01:05:34.246 --> 01:05:39.016
is, and which you can solve. You can also
talk to the leaders but you have to be humble

01:05:39.016 --> 01:05:45.397
about it. You should not be aggressive. "I
must meet Mataji, I must meet Mataji." You

01:05:45.397 --> 01:05:54.532
see, supposing you all want to meet Me individually,
what will happen? And you will be amazed only

01:05:54.606 --> 01:05:59.596
in Sydney I meet people like this. Only I
have been meeting and meeting and meeting.

01:05:59.596 --> 01:06:06.596
For that, now I would say that you should
tell your leaders first. Let them scan you

01:06:06.986 --> 01:06:12.726
out, let them write what are their problems
are. Then if I want to see, I'll see. I should

01:06:12.726 --> 01:06:23.848
have that much freedom. You can't force things
on Me, can you? I have not taken a contract

01:06:23.937 --> 01:06:30.576
with you or anything. So all of you who want
to see Me, should not talk to Vinay, because

01:06:30.576 --> 01:06:37.226
he's now fed up. He's so tired, he doesn't
know. Everybody is pressurizing him. So now

01:06:37.226 --> 01:06:42.476
please tell your leader. Leader has to give
Me your problems. Then I'll see, if I want

01:06:42.476 --> 01:06:52.858
to see or if I don't want to see. We have
to stop this. There's nothing special, nothing

01:06:52.897 --> 01:07:00.748
great that you cannot tell the leader. The
leader can solve your problem. Because I have

01:07:00.788 --> 01:07:11.568
to go from countries to counties, you know
that. Even in Australia, I travel from cities

01:07:11.598 --> 01:07:20.608
to city, which I do not do in anywhere. Even
in India, only two places I go to or only

01:07:20.638 --> 01:07:29.233
the capital. But I feel concerned about you.
You have gone through bumpy areas.

01:07:29.388 --> 01:07:33.588
But try to understand that there's no contract
with Me. If you have come to Sahaja Yoga,

01:07:33.588 --> 01:07:42.449
doesn't mean that you have right to do what
you like. No. I must cure, I must touch person,

01:07:42.528 --> 01:07:49.078
I must see. This is too much. What have you
done for Sahaja Yoga. Ask this question, "What

01:07:49.078 --> 01:07:57.999
have I done for Sahaja Yoga? How many people
I have given realization?" I've been just

01:07:58.169 --> 01:08:04.939
fighting with others, having family problems,
this, that or "Have I done anything which

01:08:04.939 --> 01:08:11.868
is constructive to help Mother?" As you know,
My age is now seventy-one, I don't know how

01:08:11.868 --> 01:08:14.929
far My husband will allow Me to travel now,
also. Whatever it is.

01:08:14.929 --> 01:08:20.898
You have to take over. You have to take the
responsibility. You have all the powers, you

01:08:20.898 --> 01:08:29.600
have all the knowledge. You are quite all
right now for Sahaja Yoga spreading. So go

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:40.293
ahead. You are wise enough to understand that
now we should spare our Mother. So nobody

01:08:40.368 --> 01:08:46.608
should be aggressive like that. All right?
If I have to see somebody, I will see. But

01:08:46.608 --> 01:08:51.838
first of all you must tell your leaders and
give them the full reason why you want to

01:08:51.838 --> 01:08:57.338
see Me, and if I think it proper, I'll see.
This much freedom you should give Me that

01:08:57.338 --> 01:09:12.110
if I want, I'll see you. There is some sort
of a protocol is there for people that they

01:09:12.138 --> 01:09:22.200
should understand that you cannot just ask
to see Me just like that.

01:09:23.819 --> 01:09:32.016
As you love Me, you can feel for Me also and
understand that what is important is you should

01:09:32.088 --> 01:09:41.516
go deep down into yourself and I am there.
I am there, absolutely. I am everywhere. You

01:09:41.588 --> 01:09:48.588
need not see My face or see Me. I am there.
Just know this fact that I am there with you

01:09:48.638 --> 01:09:55.638
all the time whether you write to Me, whether
you inform Me or not. There are people who

01:09:56.018 --> 01:10:02.868
have developed such, such tremendous faith
that Mother is everywhere, that just by praying

01:10:02.868 --> 01:10:11.217
they have saved the lives of people. Just
from praying. There are many like that. And

01:10:11.288 --> 01:10:17.458
really, it is worth seeing these people, how
simple they are. I won't even see them normally,

01:10:17.458 --> 01:10:25.391
anywhere. But they are there. And they told
Me how they have achieved so many things so

01:10:25.429 --> 01:10:33.421
easily. It is very remarkable.
There was one fellow whose mother was sick

01:10:33.509 --> 01:10:42.211
in Rohtak and he was in, I think, Bombay and
he received a message that she is sick and

01:10:42.268 --> 01:10:47.279
she will die very soon. So he rushed to the
place and they told him that within three

01:10:47.279 --> 01:10:53.208
days she will be finished. His mother is not
a realized soul nor she's a Sahaja yogini,

01:10:53.208 --> 01:11:00.059
she has never even seen Me. He said, "Mother
I couldn't help it. I just went on my knees

01:11:00.059 --> 01:11:07.521
and I just prayed, 'oh Mother, please can
You save my mother?'" Within three days the

01:11:07.588 --> 01:11:13.369
lady got all right. They said it's a galloping
cancer. He flew her to Bombay and took her

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:20.219
to the Tata hospital to find out if there
is any cancer. They said, "There's no trace

01:11:20.219 --> 01:11:29.541
of cancer." He said, "This is the last time
I have asked You for anything." I just, I

01:11:29.588 --> 01:11:38.288
just -- it has happened with many.
So it is your faith. Faith is not blind in

01:11:38.309 --> 01:11:44.259
Sahaja Yoga, you know for definite what is
Sahaja Yoga is. You have seen miraculous photographs.

01:11:44.259 --> 01:11:49.009
You have seen all the miracles happening.
So now your faith should be completely, entirely

01:11:49.009 --> 01:11:57.674
in it. And it will work out. I promise you
if your faith is deep enough to reach Me,

01:11:57.708 --> 01:12:01.384
you don't have to see My face, even not to
have My photograph, nothing. Wherever you

01:12:01.385 --> 01:12:09.385
are, you'll find Me. That's why I always say,
"Develop your faith, develop your faith."

01:12:09.437 --> 01:12:19.237
May God bless you!
May God bless you!

01:12:19.329 --> 01:12:27.499
So thank you again and again for all these
flowers and for all the nice time I had here.
