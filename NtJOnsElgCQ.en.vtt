00:00:05.047 --> 00:00:10.889
First, I‘ll speak in Hindi language

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.750
and then in English language.

00:00:20.688 --> 00:00:26.962
Today we have assembled here to worship Shri Maha Deva,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.097
Shri Shiva Shankar.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.024
In the name of Shankarji,

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:41.826
many organizations have come up in this world.

00:00:42.027 --> 00:00:47.664
Because of Adi Shankaracharya’s emphasis,

00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:52.922
worshipping ShivJi is being done by people in a big way.

00:00:53.123 --> 00:00:58.695
And in Southern India two types of sects have come up:

00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:02.088
one which is called as Shaivites,

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.639
and the other are calles as Vaishnavites.

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:11.135
Now Shaivites are the worshippers of Lord Shiva

00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:15.170
and the Vaishnavites, who worship Lord Vishnu.

00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:22.025
In our country we are expert in dividing ourselves.

00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:25.497
We divide Deities as well;

00:01:25.698 --> 00:01:31.408
and when we try to reunite them, then things take a very bad  shape.

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:35.562
For example, a new thing has come up, by name Ayyappa.

00:01:35.763 --> 00:01:38.586
It is a very wrong thing.

00:01:38.787 --> 00:01:43.237
And in that it is shown that,

00:01:43.438 --> 00:01:47.628
that when Lord Vishnu assumed the form of "Mohini",

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.217
then she got a child from Lord Shiva.

00:01:51.418 --> 00:01:53.748
Is it possible by any chance?

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:58.173
Such nonsensical beliefs are generally spread in our country,

00:01:58.374 --> 00:02:01.477
And then different groups are formed on those beliefs.

00:02:01.678 --> 00:02:04.810
When Indians find some or other reason to fight,

00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:07.418
they become very happy.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.342
If they have nothing to fight over,

00:02:11.543 --> 00:02:17.858
then, they create something from their own imaginations.

00:02:18.556 --> 00:02:24.146
So these two things are connected with each other

00:02:24.347 --> 00:02:28.957
as sun is with sun light,

00:02:29.158 --> 00:02:33.087
word with its meaning, moon with moonlight.

00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:39.924
Meaning that the `Sopan Marga’ which has been created,

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:47.181
which we, call as sushumna nadi, which is central path,

00:02:47.382 --> 00:02:49.867
is the path of Lord Vishnu.

00:02:50.068 --> 00:02:54.634
And through this path we attain the Shiva Tattva.

00:02:54.835 --> 00:02:59.547
So Shiva tattwa is the destination to Shiva,

00:02:59.748 --> 00:03:04.554
and the path is made by Lord Vishnu.

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:10.189
To create this path Vishnuji and Adishakti have taken efforts.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.569
Lord Shiva has no role in it:

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.648
He sits comfortably in his Seat,

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.839
not bothering about anyone who comes or doesn't come.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.767
So, to attain this Shiva tattwa,

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:24.761
we should go through this Vishnu path (Sushumna path)

00:03:24.962 --> 00:03:27.399
and for that, the several chakras (centres) in us,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.130
have to be corrected first.

00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:32.562
When the centers are corrected,

00:03:32.763 --> 00:03:35.307
our Vishnu path opens up.

00:03:35.508 --> 00:03:41.304
And along with that, we gradually start ascending.

00:03:41.505 --> 00:03:44.624
I have told about all these centers, many a times.

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:49.299
But, there is a center in Heart also, which we call `Left Heart’.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.846
This is not the chakra of the heart (central heart),

00:03:52.071 --> 00:03:54.676
it is just the heart,

00:03:54.875 --> 00:04:02.588
which reflects the reflection of Mahadeva.

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:07.165
The abode of Shiva is above everything,

00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:11.713
beyond the mind, beyond the thoughts.

00:04:11.914 --> 00:04:14.828
To attain this kind of tatwa (principle),

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:18.210
first and foremost we should pay attention,

00:04:18.411 --> 00:04:23.181
is to see how pure our heart is.

00:04:25.024 --> 00:04:30.999
Inside our heart, we allow a lot dirt to grow.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.994
For example, we feel jeolous of someone.

00:04:36.687 --> 00:04:42.962
Feeling jeolous - in the sense, if somebody has been evil to you,

00:04:43.163 --> 00:04:46.851
might have harmed you also, troubled you.

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:50.363
But there is no use becoming jeolous of them.

00:04:50.564 --> 00:04:52.602
If your heart is clean

00:04:52.816 --> 00:04:58.790
then the mirror in which the God almighty's reflection is going to fall,

00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:00.794
will be very clear.

00:05:00.995 --> 00:05:04.514
But if you are full of jealousy,

00:05:06.123 --> 00:05:08.133
then the mirror will not remain clean

00:05:08.334 --> 00:05:10.932
and the reflection of God will also not be perfect.

00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:13.427
To have enmity towards anyone

00:05:13.628 --> 00:05:18.125
and towards anyone to have in the heart

00:05:18.326 --> 00:05:21.273
any kind of miserable thoughts or ill feeling,

00:05:21.474 --> 00:05:23.599
is very wrong.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.660
That is why Christ has said to forgive everyone.

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:31.454
To forgive is extremely important.

00:05:31.655 --> 00:05:37.881
And before and after Christ many saints have said the same thing,

00:05:38.082 --> 00:05:39.783
that forgive everybody.

00:05:39.984 --> 00:05:45.005
The moment you forgive, immediately Lord Shiva,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.550
takes the situation in His hands.

00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:53.741
The subtlest power of all is that of Shri Mahadev.

00:05:53.942 --> 00:06:00.322
And He, then completely punishes him,

00:06:00.523 --> 00:06:04.107
totally punishes him.

00:06:04.308 --> 00:06:08.056
This is the work of Lord Mahadev, not yours.

00:06:08.257 --> 00:06:12.157
Therefore to be jealous of anyone is very bad.

00:06:12.358 --> 00:06:16.174
But I find that there is lot of jealousy even in Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:19.455
Sahaja Yogis are jealous of one another.

00:06:19.656 --> 00:06:22.750
If one person is made trustee, the other one is not,

00:06:22.951 --> 00:06:24.565
then he is jealous.

00:06:24.766 --> 00:06:27.242
This trusteeship and all have no meaning,

00:06:27.417 --> 00:06:29.464
you all know it is a myth.

00:06:29.665 --> 00:06:32.057
It is all your Mother's drama

00:06:32.264 --> 00:06:34.424
and She has spread a web of maya.

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:37.675
Even then the mind of the people gets corrupted;

00:06:37.908 --> 00:06:40.381
For one mind gets disturbed

00:06:40.588 --> 00:06:42.707
and for the other the heart gets disturbed!

00:06:42.908 --> 00:06:45.740
I do not understand what should I do!

00:06:45.941 --> 00:06:48.812
Such a big work is happening in so many countries,

00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:52.508
so I can communicate with any one person only, right?

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:55.736
However, things are getting sorted out slowly,

00:06:55.937 --> 00:06:59.601
but still you will be surprised

00:06:59.802 --> 00:07:02.760
that even now there is lot of discussion

00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:06.213
about who is the leader and who is what?

00:07:06.414 --> 00:07:10.251
Second thing is, for us, for Indians,

00:07:10.452 --> 00:07:15.458
a "blessing" is

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:19.794
the jealousy is in money matters.

00:07:20.492 --> 00:07:24.667
Even in Sahaja Yoga there is jealousy on money matters.

00:07:25.138 --> 00:07:28.413
Someone has got more money and some less.

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:31.058
While doing Sahaja work also

00:07:31.336 --> 00:07:34.293
people see how much money one gets,

00:07:34.476 --> 00:07:36.441
and who gives how much money?

00:07:36.642 --> 00:07:39.323
If a person's heart gets involved with money

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:42.860
he becomes useless for Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:43.061 --> 00:07:49.564
Because his heart gets covered with materialism.

00:07:49.765 --> 00:07:55.002
If any kind of materialism has enveloped your heart,

00:07:55.203 --> 00:07:58.290
then it is very difficult for you to ascend.

00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:00.137
This is the speciality of our country.

00:08:00.338 --> 00:08:02.399
I have not seen it so much in foreign countries.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.817
But here it is prominent.

00:08:05.018 --> 00:08:08.284
I think, in Russia and Eastern Block countries

00:08:08.485 --> 00:08:10.324
there is very little of wealth,

00:08:10.525 --> 00:08:12.530
but they are not bothered at all.

00:08:12.753 --> 00:08:14.625
They don't think about money at all.

00:08:14.768 --> 00:08:18.636
But their heart is so pure, so very pure.

00:08:18.837 --> 00:08:22.229
And only with the pure heart, devotion (bhakti) is possible.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:27.132
We all, before doing prayers, wash our feet and take bath.

00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:30.225
But bathing our heart is possible

00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:31.884
if we could ask God,

00:08:32.085 --> 00:08:36.023
that whatever negativities are there within us,

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:38.449
to please remove them and purify us,

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.137
then it will be much better.

00:08:41.338 --> 00:08:44.907
The third thing is the negativity within us,

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:47.931
which we call as six enemies (shadripu),

00:08:48.147 --> 00:08:52.766
Shri Krishna has emphasised that krodha (anger) is the worst thing.

00:08:52.967 --> 00:08:54.858
Everything emanates from anger.

00:08:55.059 --> 00:08:56.983
A person shows anger initially,

00:08:57.184 --> 00:08:59.150
then he gets infatuated.

00:08:59.351 --> 00:09:02.150
Then he thinks: "Why did I say all that, I should not have said it",

00:09:02.351 --> 00:09:03.615
and so on.

00:09:03.816 --> 00:09:06.780
But he goes out of self-control, when he gets angry.

00:09:06.984 --> 00:09:10.592
In the fit of anger he loses control over himself.

00:09:10.793 --> 00:09:12.671
He goes out of self-control

00:09:12.872 --> 00:09:16.080
and he throw words, which are meaningless.

00:09:16.281 --> 00:09:20.444
The dirt he has been accumalating since long in his heart,

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:24.150
comes out of his mouth.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.606
We have to beware of this krodha

00:09:26.807 --> 00:09:30.089
"Why does this anger come?" - we should pay attention to this,

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.790
that why do we get angry.

00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:35.197
There are some who are angry with a particular person,

00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:38.143
there are some who are angry with the society.

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:41.633
Like this, people show their anger in different ways.

00:09:41.834 --> 00:09:44.919
Why does this anger come to us?

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.507
Why do we get angry? - we should think that.

00:09:48.708 --> 00:09:50.703
Many people have told Me that,

00:09:50.904 --> 00:09:55.604
"Mother, if someone speaks against You, we get very angry".

00:09:55.805 --> 00:09:57.454
I feel like laughing at this.

00:09:57.655 --> 00:10:02.114
If anybody talks against Me, I really feel like laughing.

00:10:02.315 --> 00:10:05.880
Because there is no meaning. What is there to talk against Me?

00:10:06.081 --> 00:10:09.210
I am just sharing my love, even then if they speak against Me.

00:10:09.411 --> 00:10:10.629
What can be done?

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.132
But some people have crooked mind,

00:10:13.331 --> 00:10:15.608
so we should only pity them.

00:10:16.084 --> 00:10:19.634
We have to think that such a person is a big fool.

00:10:19.835 --> 00:10:24.069
When a person is full of anger, then our attitude towards him,

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.859
should be deeply compassionate.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.812
This attitude may also cool down his anger.

00:10:32.013 --> 00:10:35.804
In our country there are angry people of different types.

00:10:36.005 --> 00:10:37.759
There are institutions for that

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.896
who spread with their anger: "Hit this person, hit that person",

00:10:41.063 --> 00:10:42.963
"Beat up this person, beat up that person".

00:10:43.154 --> 00:10:46.501
And this is also becoming an issue at the social level.

00:10:46.702 --> 00:10:50.248
This is a very dangerous situation.

00:10:50.496 --> 00:10:52.244
To beat and thrash people,

00:10:52.445 --> 00:10:57.235
and for that purpose to form an army

00:10:57.436 --> 00:11:00.347
or prepare some weapons to beat and hurt people

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.148
is very terrifying.

00:11:02.349 --> 00:11:09.187
However, for protection, a person is equipped with these weapons,

00:11:09.388 --> 00:11:11.045
it is not a big deal.

00:11:11.244 --> 00:11:14.169
But, if he is a devotee of the God almighty,

00:11:14.368 --> 00:11:16.710
he doent require these weapons.

00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:19.999
This kind of a person is always protected.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.725
When within a person Shri Mahadev resides,

00:11:25.926 --> 00:11:28.510
Who can dare to touch such a person,

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.634
who can destroy him?

00:11:30.835 --> 00:11:33.535
Whatever you do, however you trouble him,

00:11:33.736 --> 00:11:36.598
still that person cannot be destroyed.

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:40.224
But those who harass them, will get destroyed themselves.

00:11:40.425 --> 00:11:43.770
When the complete trust regarding this will come within you,

00:11:43.971 --> 00:11:46.869
that whoever is troubling you will get destroyed,

00:11:47.076 --> 00:11:51.483
then you will keep your heart totally pure and clean..

00:11:51.684 --> 00:11:54.864
This work can happen only in a clean heart,

00:11:55.065 --> 00:11:59.110
because Shri Shiva resides in our heart, as reflection,

00:11:59.311 --> 00:12:04.029
and the reflection falls better on a cleaner mirror.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.116
Shiva Ji's anger is a one time job,

00:12:07.317 --> 00:12:10.151
or rather people say that He gets angry only once.

00:12:10.352 --> 00:12:13.196
But I have seen him getting angry many a times,

00:12:13.397 --> 00:12:15.754
because it is His right.

00:12:15.955 --> 00:12:18.203
He has a right to be angry.

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:22.131
If anyone works against Adi Shakti,

00:12:22.332 --> 00:12:24.411
then Shiv Ji has very long hands.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.881
Without listening to anyone, He finishes such a person.

00:12:28.082 --> 00:12:32.032
Because he knows that Shri Adi Shakti will not do anything Herself.

00:12:32.233 --> 00:12:35.937
She is not going to punish anyone at all,

00:12:36.138 --> 00:12:37.892
and She will forgive everyone.

00:12:38.093 --> 00:12:40.215
So, His hands are so long,

00:12:40.454 --> 00:12:42.213
that there is no limit to them

00:12:42.414 --> 00:12:45.980
and when those hands start lashing, then nobody can stop them.

00:12:46.181 --> 00:12:48.023
Who is above Him?

00:12:48.224 --> 00:12:50.420
He has got his own protocols,

00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:54.596
which you can neither change nor go beyond.

00:12:56.311 --> 00:13:01.151
This is how you should understand that in your individual life

00:13:01.352 --> 00:13:06.072
In Sahaja Yoga you have to follow only Lord Shiva.

00:13:06.273 --> 00:13:10.687
Because, if you don't follow Him, firstly,

00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:24.334
You will get heart problems.

00:13:24.877 --> 00:13:28.122
The first thing will be heart disease.

00:13:28.842 --> 00:13:31.105
It works out in two ways.

00:13:31.306 --> 00:13:34.970
Firstly with excessive anger the heart catches,

00:13:35.555 --> 00:13:39.781
and secondly, after the anger if a person repents,

00:13:39.982 --> 00:13:43.645
then he gets the disease called "angina".

00:13:43.846 --> 00:13:46.830
This is how both the things are useless.

00:13:47.031 --> 00:13:49.004
But anger doesn't go just by words.

00:13:49.172 --> 00:13:50.997
This is something like taking alcohol.

00:13:51.211 --> 00:13:53.072
It becomes a habit to get angry.

00:13:53.273 --> 00:13:55.949
Without his knowledge, his face gets swollen,

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.621
he gets extremly angry and no one can control him.

00:13:59.822 --> 00:14:02.563
So, I thought that if you sit before the mirror

00:14:02.764 --> 00:14:05.787
and get angry on yourself,

00:14:05.988 --> 00:14:08.745
rebuke yourself with few angry words

00:14:08.946 --> 00:14:11.983
and by sitting in front of the mirror if you say:

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:14.741
"There cannot be a greater fool than me",

00:14:14.942 --> 00:14:18.511
then perhaps you may get rid of your anger.

00:14:18.712 --> 00:14:20.371
I am saying might be possible,

00:14:20.572 --> 00:14:23.965
because at times, these problems are so intricate,

00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:27.188
that it is very difficult to solve them.

00:14:27.793 --> 00:14:29.773
Further, it has been observed

00:14:29.974 --> 00:14:36.639
that the more we focus our attention on something

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:43.177
and we react to it...

00:14:44.142 --> 00:14:47.180
Someone says something and we react instantly to it -

00:14:47.381 --> 00:14:50.579
this custom is more in the foreign countries.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.431
For example there is a carpet -

00:14:52.632 --> 00:14:56.818
immediately they will say, “I don’t like it, I like it.”

00:14:57.019 --> 00:14:59.230
Who are you to say all this?

00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:03.913
Nowadays it`s a fashion to say: "I like it, I don’t like it",

00:15:04.114 --> 00:15:08.820
as if every person were a renowned master

00:15:09.156 --> 00:15:11.895
who says `I like it’, `I don’t like it’.

00:15:12.439 --> 00:15:13.749
This should not be said.

00:15:14.058 --> 00:15:17.035
Saying this is the indication of your bad Agnya.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.177
What do you think of yourself

00:15:19.455 --> 00:15:22.431
that you are saying "I like it, I don't like it".

00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:29.219
You do not have a right to like or dislike any of the things.

00:15:29.624 --> 00:15:31.949
Supposing, some poor man gives you with affection,

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.655
some very beautiful flowers,

00:15:35.021 --> 00:15:37.425
and you will say "sir, I don't like this flowers".

00:15:38.178 --> 00:15:43.107
You are unable to understand the hidden emotions behind
this act

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.607
because Shiva Tattva is absent in you.

00:15:46.793 --> 00:15:48.708
Even if it is a very smaal thing,

00:15:49.208 --> 00:15:51.716
which has been given to you by a poor person,

00:15:52.175 --> 00:15:55.190
and you don't,

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.976
recognise the feeling attached to the emotion,

00:15:58.203 --> 00:16:00.393
and how lovingly he has given you that.

00:16:01.051 --> 00:16:05.440
For that in India we have the example of Sudama, has been shown.

00:16:05.711 --> 00:16:09.984
That how He arrived with roasted rice to meet Shri Krishna.

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.595
And how Shri Krishna honoured Him.

00:16:14.662 --> 00:16:17.680
Anything presented with the feelings of love

00:16:18.149 --> 00:16:20.743
is exactly like, a piece of glass,

00:16:20.944 --> 00:16:24.383
becomes a shining mirror when paras (touch stone) is applied to it

00:16:25.304 --> 00:16:28.867
similarly, if you have feelings of love for someone,

00:16:29.129 --> 00:16:32.532
a very beautiful and good feeling, but you have no money,

00:16:32.882 --> 00:16:36.929
then, even if you gift that person a very small thing, then

00:16:37.328 --> 00:16:40.901
the other person should think "aha! what an excellent thing is this"

00:16:41.529 --> 00:16:46.981
But, this feeling of love gives a subtle sight to the person.

00:16:47.621 --> 00:16:50.025
which can be called as artistic.

00:16:50.423 --> 00:16:52.843
artistic qualities emanates from it.

00:16:53.208 --> 00:16:54.585
When art is visible from it,

00:16:54.991 --> 00:16:57.228
you start thinking how artistic thing is this.

00:16:57.729 --> 00:17:01.398
This art is the art of love, this is the art of love.

00:17:01.557 --> 00:17:05.112
By this art you can clearly see that,

00:17:05.477 --> 00:17:07.802
how much of love is there in this person?

00:17:08.199 --> 00:17:09.568
How affectionate he is.

00:17:09.965 --> 00:17:15.314
How loving he is, what a gentleman is he, what a good person is he.

00:17:15.902 --> 00:17:18.304
When you start seeing this quality in others

00:17:18.505 --> 00:17:20.606
then you will look within yourself,

00:17:20.812 --> 00:17:23.789
and you will start thinking "What am I?”

00:17:24.749 --> 00:17:26.756
“Do I have that much of love?”

00:17:26.989 --> 00:17:28.735
“do I have this gentleman qualities"?

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:30.679
"Do I have all this goodness within me,

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.441
or am I rendering lip service only"?

00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:37.939
and thus misleading the people"?

00:17:38.623 --> 00:17:41.376
Actually, we are misleading ourselves and none other.

00:17:41.749 --> 00:17:44.884
When we are doing wrong things, living a wrong lifestyle,

00:17:45.366 --> 00:17:47.453
when in our lives are completely

00:17:48.168 --> 00:17:50.260
filled with wrong conceptions,

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.602
then we can not make anyone happy.

00:17:53.062 --> 00:17:55.205
and definitely not ourselves also.

00:17:55.546 --> 00:17:57.574
So from the point of view of “swartha”,

00:17:57.751 --> 00:18:01.798
the word "Swa" is very beautiful,"to know thyself" (swa ka arth)

00:18:02.402 --> 00:18:05.925
"Swa" means spirit, you must know the meaning of it.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.585
To know the meaning, people worship Shiv Ji.

00:18:09.768 --> 00:18:14.329
But I have seen that the worshipers of Shiva are very hot tempered,

00:18:15.591 --> 00:18:20.091
very ill tempered , very miserly and what not.

00:18:20.804 --> 00:18:26.026
No deity is as generous Shiv JI, no one is as loving as ShivJi.

00:18:26.418 --> 00:18:30.604
This source of love which is flowing today all around,

00:18:30.803 --> 00:18:32.628
is emanating from His Holy feet.

00:18:32.985 --> 00:18:35.858
It is because of Him, this work is happening.

00:18:36.001 --> 00:18:40.004
that human beings are bathing in the ocean of love in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:40.459 --> 00:18:44.471
In Sahaja Yoga after Self-realization, when you attain that state,

00:18:44.771 --> 00:18:46.102
then you,

00:18:47.199 --> 00:18:49.121
the state of say Jiva Atma,

00:18:50.065 --> 00:18:51.625
or your,

00:18:52.734 --> 00:18:54.100
attention,

00:18:54.612 --> 00:18:58.572
your attention gets engrossed in the lotus feet of Shiv Ji.

00:18:59.869 --> 00:19:02.782
And as soon as it gets engrossed in Shiv Ji's lotus feet,

00:19:03.933 --> 00:19:06.591
what happens is within you,

00:19:07.173 --> 00:19:12.137
whatever qualities aaaa of five elements are there,

00:19:12.473 --> 00:19:14.567
they also become very subtle.

00:19:15.552 --> 00:19:19.004
Already, I have told you about the four elements,

00:19:19.316 --> 00:19:22.792
but the fifth one, which is called ‘Ether’ in English,

00:19:22.993 --> 00:19:25.693
I didn’t tell about that, here it is called akash tatva.

00:19:26.328 --> 00:19:31.407
Akash tatva is that, when a seeker attains the subtle state,

00:19:32.379 --> 00:19:35.575
then he attains the Subtlety of Ether element.

00:19:36.268 --> 00:19:40.855
That akash which is etherial, that akash,

00:19:45.258 --> 00:19:47.178
need not be activated also.

00:19:48.121 --> 00:19:53.291
If a person has any problem or any trouble,

00:19:53.466 --> 00:19:55.259
then through this all pervading power,

00:19:55.736 --> 00:20:01.979
of akash tatva, which is omnipresent,

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:07.778
Your attention immediately reaches, where it is required.

00:20:08.287 --> 00:20:11.849
It is an amazing thing, but it happens and happened also.

00:20:12.111 --> 00:20:15.746
people may call it miracle, but it is not so.

00:20:16.063 --> 00:20:20.063
In Sahaja Yoga if your Shiva tatva is awakened,

00:20:20.432 --> 00:20:23.194
then all the subtle qualities,

00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:26.178
the subtlest of the subtle quality,

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:31.914
the emotions and the state within you gets awakened.

00:20:33.018 --> 00:20:36.255
Therefore it is necessary for us to, first of all  purify our heart.

00:20:37.676 --> 00:20:41.930
Now, so far I have talked to you, about three enemies.

00:20:42.511 --> 00:20:46.177
Now, the fourth enemy present within us is madha.

00:20:47.098 --> 00:20:48.582
Madha means "Ego".

00:20:51.671 --> 00:20:56.640
When this ego effects women, they start walking like men.

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:00.600
Then they cannot walk like women because of the pride.

00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:03.672
"I am something very special" kind of feeling.

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:09.922
supposing a girl  either comes from a very rich family,

00:21:10.137 --> 00:21:12.041
or she is very beautiful,

00:21:12.359 --> 00:21:15.084
or very well educated, what ever the reason be,

00:21:15.466 --> 00:21:17.632
if she gets effected by ego,

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:22.552
then woman, starts walking like a man.

00:21:24.316 --> 00:21:28.841
And when a man is effected by ego, he starts walking like a woman.

00:21:30.517 --> 00:21:32.855
Meaning, such a man makes himself up,

00:21:33.284 --> 00:21:38.045
for hours sits before the mirror, combs his hair, does this and that

00:21:38.371 --> 00:21:40.246
does all kinds of feminine actions.

00:21:42.024 --> 00:21:43.746
To dress up is the job of the woman.

00:21:43.913 --> 00:21:45.801
while walking also he doesn't walk straight.

00:21:46.002 --> 00:21:47.720
He walks in a peculier fashion.

00:21:48.146 --> 00:21:49.470
From behind, if you see him, you will feel as if

00:21:49.671 --> 00:21:52.927
a lady is walking in a male dress,

00:21:55.203 --> 00:21:57.362
So, when,

00:21:58.017 --> 00:22:03.186
a man gets intoxicated with this , ego, (madha)

00:22:03.992 --> 00:22:05.714
then he is in his own world.

00:22:06.411 --> 00:22:09.647
And he starts swaying like an intoxicated elephant

00:22:11.014 --> 00:22:13.324
All their activities are different and prominent.

00:22:13.578 --> 00:22:17.847
Whether they talk, or they don't talk, or how they sit

00:22:18.356 --> 00:22:21.049
in every action it is apparent that,

00:22:21.311 --> 00:22:23.535
they have some kind of ego within them.

00:22:24.105 --> 00:22:27.189
It is difficult to understand the cause of their ego.

00:22:27.793 --> 00:22:30.117
what makes them think that they are special.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.625
All these things are insignificant.

00:22:33.586 --> 00:22:35.371
It has no meaning at all.

00:22:35.759 --> 00:22:38.348
In Sahaja they have no meaning at all.

00:22:38.982 --> 00:22:41.045
And so that is why (laughs)

00:22:41.486 --> 00:22:43.769
to believe in the kind of things,

00:22:43.999 --> 00:22:48.046
that "we are something special", then you just end up to be nothing.

00:22:49.063 --> 00:22:51.237
You do not remain to be special, you are nothing.

00:22:51.437 --> 00:22:55.715
It means, its not wise to have any imagination about self

00:22:56.449 --> 00:22:59.076
that I am very rich or I am something great.

00:22:59.277 --> 00:23:01.935
Now even the poor people suffer from ego element;

00:23:02.769 --> 00:23:05.816
Even the dalits are becoming egoistic, Its beyond understanding:

00:23:06.294 --> 00:23:10.023
They talk as if they are something very great.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.507
What are you as an individual?

00:23:12.944 --> 00:23:15.573
A devotee of God Almighty.

00:23:17.026 --> 00:23:20.097
You are Sahaja Yogis, who believe in God.

00:23:21.785 --> 00:23:24.938
To think about yourself like that,

00:23:25.423 --> 00:23:27.319
is to go away from the state of joy, (anand).

00:23:27.772 --> 00:23:31.142
because the power of Shiva takes the seeker to the state of joy.

00:23:31.825 --> 00:23:35.420
To get engrossed in the state of joy, a man

00:23:35.817 --> 00:23:37.229
worships Lord Shiva.

00:23:37.479 --> 00:23:40.128
But I have seen that most of the Shiva bhaktas

00:23:40.477 --> 00:23:43.509
are filthy type of people, no one can dare to talk to them.

00:23:44.054 --> 00:23:45.022
What is the use?

00:23:45.205 --> 00:23:48.002
Because the are woeshipping Sakshat Natraj,

00:23:48.376 --> 00:23:51.994
from whom emanates all form of arts,

00:23:52.304 --> 00:23:56.660
extremely joyful and embodiment of permanent joy,

00:23:57.164 --> 00:24:00.827
before Him, how could these pseudo devotees be called His bhaktas?

00:24:01.223 --> 00:24:03.501
They hang such a big linga in their neck,

00:24:03.715 --> 00:24:05.342
that could give heart attack.

00:24:05.755 --> 00:24:06.874
What is the need for that?

00:24:07.075 --> 00:24:09.446
You are yourself the sakshat linga swarupa.

00:24:09.866 --> 00:24:14.470
Without becoming that, they, who are worshipping Shiva claim that,

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.248
"we are Shiva Bhaktas".

00:24:16.399 --> 00:24:18.319
They do Shiva bhakti and also fight.

00:24:18.756 --> 00:24:20.906
And for this they have different marks.

00:24:21.283 --> 00:24:24.219
Shiva bhaktas will use sandal pwder across the forehead,

00:24:24.664 --> 00:24:27.686
and Vishnu bhaktas will use the same along the forehead.

00:24:28.274 --> 00:24:31.178
dear brother! what does this mean?

00:24:31.655 --> 00:24:34.765
Vertical application on means that we are ascending. Alright,

00:24:35.099 --> 00:24:37.390
if you are ascending spiritually,

00:24:37.591 --> 00:24:39.997
then after ascending you should be peaceful.

00:24:41.122 --> 00:24:44.201
It should be applied both ways, or don't apply at all.

00:24:44.781 --> 00:24:46.662
It should have some meaning,

00:24:46.869 --> 00:24:49.435
that whatever we are trying to achieve,

00:24:49.724 --> 00:24:51.872
should be through this central path.

00:24:52.071 --> 00:24:53.737
While passing through this way,

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:56.761
you have to leave behind all the negativities.

00:24:58.677 --> 00:25:02.376
Before criticizing others, learn to criticize yourself.

00:25:04.229 --> 00:25:07.093
"I am like this, I am like that", say it to yourself,

00:25:08.236 --> 00:25:10.998
when you start critisizing yourself, then you will see that

00:25:11.199 --> 00:25:13.073
all the bhoots (evil spirits) will run away.

00:25:13.311 --> 00:25:15.787
Because we have gathered all these negativities.

00:25:16.017 --> 00:25:19.033
by our continuous thought process, by our Agnya;

00:25:19.494 --> 00:25:23.162
The excessive use of Agnya, started accumalating negative forces,

00:25:23.384 --> 00:25:24.725
every thing became mental projection,

00:25:24.926 --> 00:25:28.987
and such a person becomes very troublesome and miserable.

00:25:29.645 --> 00:25:32.510
And that misary makes him also miserable.

00:25:33.423 --> 00:25:36.320
By giving unhappiness to others, you can never be happy.

00:25:36.615 --> 00:25:39.282
It will have its impact on you even if you are a stone.

00:25:39.521 --> 00:25:41.354
It will have its impact

00:25:41.814 --> 00:25:44.671
and the impact is such that, the person becomes miserable.

00:25:48.211 --> 00:25:52.489
As far as a mother is concerned, she always thinks of your welfare.

00:25:53.512 --> 00:25:55.829
She thinks of the things which can give you comfort,

00:25:56.505 --> 00:26:00.432
give you contentment and give you peace of mind.

00:26:00.952 --> 00:26:02.571
Which can give you love,

00:26:02.994 --> 00:26:05.819
and you become a saintly person in this world.

00:26:06.563 --> 00:26:08.328
This is the method of the Mother.

00:26:08.614 --> 00:26:10.534
But this is not Lord Shiva's method.

00:26:11.019 --> 00:26:14.249
He tolerates upto a certain limit and then deals so severely

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.796
that I get terrified that what is going to happen to this person.

00:26:19.083 --> 00:26:21.768
Where shall he reach? What is He doing?

00:26:21.931 --> 00:26:23.271
He doesn't think that.

00:26:23.761 --> 00:26:27.393
It is not within His nature to think that,

00:26:27.623 --> 00:26:33.212
what if he is very bad and very evil, let me forgive him.

00:26:33.339 --> 00:26:37.141
Yes, if the person is worthy of His forgiveness, then He forgives.

00:26:37.332 --> 00:26:40.243
And those who meditate upon Him continuously,

00:26:40.474 --> 00:26:42.439
He blesses them with boons.

00:26:43.204 --> 00:26:45.124
But that person who,

00:26:47.004 --> 00:26:48.804
basically,

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:52.514
does not want to rectify himself, Lord Shiva sets him right.

00:26:52.779 --> 00:26:53.925
This is true.

00:26:54.117 --> 00:26:55.548
That’s why we should be scared of Him.

00:26:55.699 --> 00:26:57.358
that is why He is called Bhayankar.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:01.139
When He gets angry, He does not forgive anyone.

00:27:01.676 --> 00:27:06.424
But His worst anger comes, during the time of doomsday,

00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:09.239
what we call as "A night will come,

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:11.081
when the whole creation will come to an end".

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.441
At that time He will destroy everything with his anger.

00:27:15.147 --> 00:27:21.092
This time comes, as I have told you, at the time of last judgement.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.305
In this, which path you take to, where you go,

00:27:25.573 --> 00:27:30.323
whatever you are doing, all these things are completely.

00:27:31.595 --> 00:27:32.944
stored within you.

00:27:34.333 --> 00:27:36.450
Every small detail about you,

00:27:37.332 --> 00:27:42.141
accordingly sends you either to heaven or to hell.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:46.706
It is Lord Shiva who sends people to hell; I do not do that.

00:27:47.088 --> 00:27:49.024
I have nothing to do with (Narka) Hell.

00:27:49.175 --> 00:27:50.746
But Lord Shiva has

00:27:50.945 --> 00:27:53.796
He will pull you by your legs and throw you in the hell.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.637
Then you can not say that I am the worshipper of the Mother,

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:03.323
and I am the follower of mother, then why is this happening to me?

00:28:04.589 --> 00:28:06.394
I am not instrumental in it.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:11.279
Once some one calls me Mother, then I can not think ill of him.

00:28:11.716 --> 00:28:12.509
But,

00:28:13.255 --> 00:28:16.881
If I am the dignity (Maryadas) for Shiva then He is my dignity too.

00:28:17.572 --> 00:28:22.047
But, in this regard since we both are totally opposite in nature,

00:28:22.293 --> 00:28:24.428
you have to be very careful.

00:28:26.431 --> 00:28:30.517
And, the eleven Rudras present in Jesus Christ also is HIM (Shiv ji)

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.591
The emotions of the Rudras are the form of Lord Shiva.

00:28:34.862 --> 00:28:38.218
that is why, you have to be very careful.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:43.486
regarding this I have to warn you because,

00:28:43.756 --> 00:28:47.405
even in Sahaja Yoga some people come to earn money,

00:28:47.606 --> 00:28:50.794
some talk ill of others, some do wrong things,

00:28:50.961 --> 00:28:52.802
some do injustice,

00:28:53.218 --> 00:28:56.023
Such persons are sieved out of the stream,

00:28:56.222 --> 00:28:59.642
But as soon as they are out, they get into the orbit of Lord Shiva.

00:28:59.999 --> 00:29:02.407
Then I get the news that, they have gone bankrupt,

00:29:02.608 --> 00:29:06.026
this has happened, that has happened, I say now don't tell me this.

00:29:06.709 --> 00:29:11.045
Now he himself has out of his protection, then who could save him?

00:29:12.006 --> 00:29:17.077
So, you should try to seek your protection in Lord Shiva.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.089
Of course, you are protected by the Mother,

00:29:20.296 --> 00:29:22.168
But you should seek Lord Shiva's protection,

00:29:22.383 --> 00:29:26.700
For that, I told you about the five things now.

00:29:27.077 --> 00:29:32.011
The subtlity of these five element, should be attained by you.

00:29:32.379 --> 00:29:38.519
And to achieve that State, its necessary to meditate regularly.

00:29:39.988 --> 00:29:42.495
Those who meditate, look totally different

00:29:42.995 --> 00:29:45.907
And those who do not meditate look different,

00:29:46.727 --> 00:29:48.099
there is no doubt about it.

00:29:48.536 --> 00:29:51.627
Now those who meditate but they are not willing to do so,

00:29:51.952 --> 00:29:53.531
Whose attention is not there in meditation,

00:29:53.732 --> 00:29:57.087
those who do not have understanding or expertise for meditation,

00:29:57.341 --> 00:29:58.904
and towards that,

00:29:59.544 --> 00:30:01.750
there is a kind of lazyness, then

00:30:02.306 --> 00:30:04.409
that meditation is not successful.

00:30:05.258 --> 00:30:06.722
there is no benefit in that.

00:30:07.365 --> 00:30:12.754
Meditation should be such that, each and every cell of your body,

00:30:13.948 --> 00:30:17.344
gets filled with joy, and happiness pours out of them.

00:30:17.781 --> 00:30:20.297
Lord Shiva's first and,

00:30:21.012 --> 00:30:25.966
most important blessings is that,

00:30:26.236 --> 00:30:29.783
he gives you Joy, fills your being with happiness.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:36.516
just by chanting his name, a person,

00:30:36.865 --> 00:30:38.341
should become joyous.

00:30:39.006 --> 00:30:42.458
But instead people always behave opposite to it.

00:30:43.578 --> 00:30:47.647
Whatever is expected does not happen, this makes me feel surprised,

00:30:48.307 --> 00:30:52.179
that the people whom we think to be Shiva bhaktas (devotees),

00:30:52.423 --> 00:30:56.797
how could they be so dry personalities? Not possible at all..

00:30:58.164 --> 00:31:00.140
There is one more reason for it.

00:31:00.601 --> 00:31:04.831
Those who are busy working always, too busy,

00:31:06.157 --> 00:31:07.775
they become right sided.

00:31:08.691 --> 00:31:12.549
When they become right sided, they get disconnected from Lord Shiva

00:31:13.827 --> 00:31:15.668
They move away from Lord Shiva.

00:31:15.915 --> 00:31:18.954
and then Shiva shows His powers.

00:31:19.983 --> 00:31:23.245
Now You know that goddess Saraswati is the sister of Lord Shiva.

00:31:23.587 --> 00:31:25.545
The worshippers of Saraswati,

00:31:25.747 --> 00:31:31.030
meaning, the people who read and write, who gather knowledge,

00:31:31.274 --> 00:31:37.298
and apart from that, who are interested in art,

00:31:37.679 --> 00:31:39.338
who are genuine art lovers,

00:31:39.774 --> 00:31:44.308
this kind of people who worship Shri Saraswti, pay homage to her,

00:31:44.484 --> 00:31:48.618
they should know first of all that She is Shiv Ji's sister

00:31:49.174 --> 00:31:52.118
and you know that sister's relationship is amazing.

00:31:53.086 --> 00:31:57.571
If you try to insult His sister,

00:31:57.866 --> 00:32:01.714
adopt any bad qualities or talk ill of Her,

00:32:02.104 --> 00:32:05.045
for example many people write impure literature or bad books,

00:32:05.633 --> 00:32:09.633
many people have knowledge, but they misuse it,

00:32:09.951 --> 00:32:13.748
this kind of people can not escape the wrath of Shiv Ji.

00:32:14.312 --> 00:32:17.245
Because His sister is very important to Him.

00:32:18.124 --> 00:32:22.024
And to insult Her is like greatest sin on earth.

00:32:22.342 --> 00:32:24.666
In His view, it is a very big sin.

00:32:25.061 --> 00:32:27.299
And for Adi Shakti also His protocols,

00:32:29.833 --> 00:32:33.368
are equally rigid, there is no doubt about that.

00:32:33.495 --> 00:32:37.979
(please check this, it is falling off, now it is alright)

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:39.830
And now,

00:32:41.172 --> 00:32:45.421
Sahaja Yogis, first of all have to pay attention towards themselves.

00:32:46.796 --> 00:32:49.677
I do not mean that they should sit before the mirror for hours .

00:32:49.834 --> 00:32:50.683
Not at all.

00:32:51.008 --> 00:32:54.453
sitting before the mirror always also is considered to be a disease.

00:32:55.185 --> 00:32:59.057
I mean to say that you should have attention towards your ‘self’.

00:32:59.591 --> 00:33:04.399
look at yourself and see" what are the problems within me"?

00:33:05.424 --> 00:33:07.606
“What wrong things am I doing?”

00:33:08.544 --> 00:33:11.392
In our Indian culture, (caughs)

00:33:11.642 --> 00:33:15.086
the straight path, which has been suggested, should be taken,

00:33:15.761 --> 00:33:17.887
Now a days, new Era has come,

00:33:18.181 --> 00:33:20.894
so, people think they can live as they want, but it is not so.

00:33:22.864 --> 00:33:24.494
Being in India,

00:33:24.716 --> 00:33:28.655
you have to be totally according to the Indian culture,

00:33:29.169 --> 00:33:35.024
Your life style should remain connected to lndian culture, because,

00:33:35.461 --> 00:33:38.596
in Indian culture, great importance is given to Shiva Tattva.

00:33:39.054 --> 00:33:41.393
Most important of all is Shiva Tatva.

00:33:41.774 --> 00:33:45.663
And Shiva Tattva only has created our boundries of good conduct.

00:33:46.311 --> 00:33:49.678
The moment you cross these maryadas, you are finished.

00:33:51.123 --> 00:33:54.035
All these rnaryadas which are in our culture

00:33:54.236 --> 00:33:56.495
are because of the grace of Lord Shiva.

00:33:57.507 --> 00:34:02.832
Whatever has been told to us so far, don't do this, don't do that,

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:04.849
everything big and small,

00:34:05.246 --> 00:34:07.901
maryadas (boundreis) has been laid by Lord Shiva.

00:34:08.306 --> 00:34:11.973
He is so much concerned about His maryadas that,

00:34:12.505 --> 00:34:16.727
The moment you step over these boundries,

00:34:17.013 --> 00:34:19.108
you get affected by them.

00:34:20.472 --> 00:34:22.075
Now, in the name of Shiva Tattva,

00:34:22.276 --> 00:34:25.130
People have created so many wrong ideas.

00:34:25.734 --> 00:34:29.004
Like, many people think that by taking Bhang (an intoxicating drink)

00:34:29.289 --> 00:34:31.242
you can awaken Shiva Tatva.

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:34.556
Many others who consume liquer think that,

00:34:34.882 --> 00:34:37.679
drinking of Alcohol submerges you in Shiva Tattva!

00:34:38.204 --> 00:34:42.013
Many wrong ideas of this type, has been created by people,

00:34:42.214 --> 00:34:44.468
that, this kind of act is alright for Shiv Ji.

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:47.062
It is fine for Shiv Ji to do that.

00:34:47.816 --> 00:34:50.419
For that matter Shiv Ji drank poison also.

00:34:50.986 --> 00:34:52.668
Would you also drink poison?

00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:58.819
He drank poison to make the whole world free from it.

00:34:59.681 --> 00:35:03.180
that is why He used to eat Dhatura (moon flower),

00:35:03.506 --> 00:35:05.801
because dhatura contains poison.

00:35:06.904 --> 00:35:11.182
Similarly you might have heard that Sai Nath,

00:35:11.486 --> 00:35:12.827
used plenty of tobacco,

00:35:13.128 --> 00:35:18.330
Aaaaaa! He used to fill it in a pipe and inhale the smoke.

00:35:18.648 --> 00:35:22.664
Because, in Maharashtra people are addicted to tobacco, everybody.

00:35:23.065 --> 00:35:25.007
Minister also will consume tobacco and

00:35:25.208 --> 00:35:27.398
his servant also will consume that.

00:35:27.573 --> 00:35:31.079
And minister will tell the servant, "give me tobacco if you have".

00:35:33.086 --> 00:35:37.197
To this extent there people are used to tobacco

00:35:37.808 --> 00:35:40.784
Although this tobacco is not grown there. (in Maharashtra).

00:35:41.031 --> 00:35:43.888
But somehow they are crazy of tobacco.

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.753
to great extent people consume tobacco in Maharashtra.

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:50.281
To free people of this tobacco Sainath,

00:35:50.543 --> 00:35:54.743
thought," why don't I consume the whole tobacco".

00:35:55.142 --> 00:35:58.174
that is why He used to inhale Tobacco,

00:35:58.375 --> 00:35:59.361
But people started saying,

00:35:59.567 --> 00:36:02.063
"Sainath is taking tobacco, so we also can take it".

00:36:02.233 --> 00:36:06.614
Because of these kind of people, He used to consume tobacco

00:36:06.821 --> 00:36:10.887
so that the tobacco addiction of these people will come to an end.,

00:36:11.816 --> 00:36:15.816
Now, what ever you call it, tobacco is tobacco,

00:36:16.142 --> 00:36:19.970
Now, the connection between Lord Shiva and tobacco is not direct,

00:36:20.171 --> 00:36:22.234
but it is definite that

00:36:23.386 --> 00:36:27.370
He wanted to destroy the tobacco from the whole world.

00:36:27.879 --> 00:36:29.712
Now supposing you are the Goddess,

00:36:30.315 --> 00:36:34.620
so the job of the Goddess is to eat all the bhoots.

00:36:35.049 --> 00:36:36.929
would you also eat Bhoot?

00:36:38.279 --> 00:36:41.394
And it is the job of the Goddess is that,

00:36:41.585 --> 00:36:48.259
what ever deseases you are having, she absorbs all of them.

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.596
So, Would you also do the same?

00:36:52.072 --> 00:36:53.548
This is not your job.

00:36:54.771 --> 00:36:59.082
Similarly, whatever saints and sages have done,

00:36:59.321 --> 00:37:04.606
you neither have the power to do any of that, nor it is your job.

00:37:05.155 --> 00:37:07.816
Your duty is to cleanse yourself,

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:11.784
to correct yourself and first attain that state,

00:37:12.436 --> 00:37:14.378
then all other matters will be alright.

00:37:14.711 --> 00:37:18.220
But, if you don't reach that state, it is useless.

00:37:18.561 --> 00:37:21.570
All the rituals you are doing will be a waste.

00:37:22.333 --> 00:37:26.499
There are many things, for which the justification

00:37:27.436 --> 00:37:29.436
can be done in a wrong manner.

00:37:31.038 --> 00:37:35.180
but if we go in the right direction, in right manner,

00:37:35.376 --> 00:37:38.755
then first of all we have to purify our hearts.

00:37:39.581 --> 00:37:41.724
All these habits, we are addicted to,

00:37:42.978 --> 00:37:45.525
these habits also altogether

00:37:47.438 --> 00:37:48.803
affect our heart.

00:37:50.018 --> 00:37:52.477
So in the olden times, it so happened,

00:37:52.827 --> 00:37:57.117
that all the disciples who came were made to sleep  in jungles,

00:38:06.365 --> 00:38:10.912
They used to live in jungles among the snakes, scorpions

00:38:11.259 --> 00:38:13.743
cobwebs and other animals..

00:38:15.838 --> 00:38:19.020
so that you do not get addicted to luxurious life.

00:38:20.655 --> 00:38:26.964
At the most they could sleep in huts, which was done with cow dung

00:38:27.521 --> 00:38:31.561
They used to live a very simple life, and wear minimum of clothes.

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:35.960
so that they could not be crazy about clothes.

00:38:37.833 --> 00:38:40.989
"We want to wear theses cloths, we want this shoes,

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:45.243
we want this food", Sahajayogis should not say all this.

00:38:45.861 --> 00:38:48.253
You know that your Mother could live anywhere,

00:38:48.584 --> 00:38:50.824
could sleep anywhere; could eat any food.

00:38:51.277 --> 00:38:53.618
So this taste bud within us,

00:38:54.650 --> 00:39:00.105
In our country, all the Indians are very fond of eating.

00:39:00.952 --> 00:39:04.591
Sahaja Yogis also invite each other for dinner and lunch.

00:39:06.482 --> 00:39:09.283
Ladies, in perticularly have that thing to say,

00:39:09.482 --> 00:39:11.785
when I go somewhere "mother, come to our house for a meal".

00:39:11.986 --> 00:39:14.756
I say, its difficult for me to go and eat anywhere.

00:39:15.073 --> 00:39:18.478
I can not eat in a hotel, I can not eat anywhere

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:22.869
Even in my own house I eat without salt and sugar.

00:39:24.027 --> 00:39:26.821
My taste buds are like that from my childhood.

00:39:27.347 --> 00:39:29.331
Whatever is available I eat that.

00:39:29.601 --> 00:39:33.751
But our tongue is used to spicy and tangy tastes, all Indians.

00:39:34.239 --> 00:39:40.449
Whether they are from from U.P., from Punjab or from South

00:39:40.624 --> 00:39:44.762
In the matter of eating, Indians are great experts.

00:39:45.643 --> 00:39:48.849
They befool men by serving them good food.

00:39:51.322 --> 00:39:56.829
"My husband is fond of this food, my husband is fond of that food"

00:39:57.115 --> 00:39:58.091
What to do?

00:39:58.282 --> 00:40:01.581
Women will be slaves to their husband and try to please them.

00:40:01.827 --> 00:40:04.160
If day and night they keep talking about food,

00:40:04.361 --> 00:40:05.987
then they are not Sahaja Yogis

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:11.019
And when I was there in Milan

00:40:11.702 --> 00:40:15.891
There during the program of Guru puja, I myself cooked food.

00:40:16.082 --> 00:40:16.978
What to do?

00:40:17.272 --> 00:40:19.708
For four years I myself cooked there,

00:40:19.971 --> 00:40:22.351
because no one else could prepare tasty food.

00:40:22.777 --> 00:40:25.281
People would say "Mother, it tastes just like plastic".

00:40:25.496 --> 00:40:27.606
In perticular all Indians.

00:40:27.981 --> 00:40:31.068
All the Indians who come their for Puja, have to meet me.

00:40:31.251 --> 00:40:33.148
as if they have special right over me.

00:40:33.331 --> 00:40:35.510
Also they are very critical of the food,

00:40:36.243 --> 00:40:37.870
that the food served here is not good.

00:40:38.053 --> 00:40:41.174
Now one more new thing has begun among Indians,

00:40:41.603 --> 00:40:43.674
that they want attached bath.

00:40:46.026 --> 00:40:49.426
Their bathrooms, if you go to their houses and see,

00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:51.234
how their parents lived there.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.075
Now, they want attaced bath, that too of the western style.

00:40:55.723 --> 00:40:58.969
I am mentioning this today, because I am tired of it.

00:40:59.827 --> 00:41:04.265
In Ganapatipule, I provided Western bathrooms for the foreigners.

00:41:05.901 --> 00:41:07.512
At first I provided Indian toilets,

00:41:07.713 --> 00:41:10.646
thinking that Indians will like Indian style.

00:41:11.409 --> 00:41:13.876
And provided English people with western style.

00:41:14.274 --> 00:41:16.797
But Indian also demanded western bathrooms.

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:18.170
Now what is this?

00:41:18.441 --> 00:41:21.123
I said now a strike is going to start here.

00:41:21.877 --> 00:41:26.182
I said, take tumblers and go to jungle, that is what you deserve.

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:29.690
For years together that is how they have been going,

00:41:29.857 --> 00:41:33.777
But now they have become big Sahibs, they want attached bathrooms.

00:41:35.313 --> 00:41:37.487
The poor English people,

00:41:37.932 --> 00:41:40.122
poor foreigners who had come from abroad said,

00:41:40.323 --> 00:41:42.323
mother! we prefer Indian style.

00:41:42.585 --> 00:41:45.911
Because they are very clean, so give us Indian bathrooms only.

00:41:46.142 --> 00:41:47.506
Then I changed the arrangement

00:41:47.707 --> 00:41:51.435
and Indians were very happy that they got attached bathrooms.

00:41:52.693 --> 00:41:54.518
You should be ashamed of it.

00:41:55.185 --> 00:41:58.177
Sahaja Yogis, talking about such things should be ashamed.

00:41:58.611 --> 00:42:00.784
Your forefathers used to go to jungle with tumblers

00:42:00.985 --> 00:42:02.355
and why do you have this new hobby?

00:42:02.578 --> 00:42:05.427
Have you got some disease or any other problem?

00:42:06.471 --> 00:42:08.216
They put me in great trouble.

00:42:08.352 --> 00:42:10.502
But somehow it struck me that

00:42:10.703 --> 00:42:13.020
"okay you take this and you take that"

00:42:16.899 --> 00:42:19.492
This kind of giving excuses and this kind of work,

00:42:19.693 --> 00:42:21.304
is typical nature of an Indian.

00:42:22.088 --> 00:42:25.286
You will be surprised, people who come to Cabella,

00:42:25.684 --> 00:42:27.754
all of them stay with one another,

00:42:27.874 --> 00:42:31.110
though they are very rich people, they have cars and everything,

00:42:31.311 --> 00:42:33.086
still they would sleep in the pendal,

00:42:33.287 --> 00:42:36.610
but Indians will have a special place for themselves,

00:42:37.116 --> 00:42:39.389
they will stay in hotels and roam around in cars,

00:42:39.666 --> 00:42:42.063
They do not have, even to a small extent,

00:42:42.285 --> 00:42:44.938
any kind of sacrificing attitude.

00:42:46.887 --> 00:42:49.125
They have not learnt how to sacrifice

00:42:49.332 --> 00:42:52.133
this modernism is beyond me to understand.

00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:57.070
Now, there are no servants in their houses.

00:42:58.333 --> 00:42:59.967
So, they have no attached bath,

00:43:00.168 --> 00:43:02.992
they have only one bathroom, because they only have to clean it.

00:43:03.358 --> 00:43:07.095
You all have servants, so you can afford even ten-ten bathrooms.

00:43:08.197 --> 00:43:11.675
But all these things are taking you away

00:43:11.876 --> 00:43:13.493
from your own powers.

00:43:14.165 --> 00:43:16.442
Your attention is going in useless things.

00:43:17.222 --> 00:43:19.446
Frittering away of the attention in absurdities,

00:43:20.132 --> 00:43:26.210
all these will make you a very ordinary human being.

00:43:27.199 --> 00:43:30.734
Among women, it is fashion now-a-days to go to beaty parlours.

00:43:31.103 --> 00:43:32.588
their face will remain the same.

00:43:32.791 --> 00:43:35.979
They will spend money there, do this here and do that there.

00:43:36.245 --> 00:43:38.705
In Pune, wife of Brahmins

00:43:39.279 --> 00:43:42.485
will wear sleeveless dresses, use eye goggles,

00:43:43.315 --> 00:43:45.268
And roam around in a moped,

00:43:46.148 --> 00:43:47.415
not understandable.

00:43:49.447 --> 00:43:51.583
In Pune, which is punya-pattanam (land of good deeds).

00:43:51.814 --> 00:43:53.819
Is this the way to do good deeds?

00:43:55.313 --> 00:43:58.398
This is how we are adopting western system,

00:43:58.557 --> 00:44:01.941
without thinking, where is Shiva Tatva in this?

00:44:04.152 --> 00:44:05.588
Look at Shri Shiva,

00:44:06.406 --> 00:44:07.739
He is sitting with minimum of clothes.

00:44:07.907 --> 00:44:11.112
In His marriage procession also He sat upon Nandi and went.

00:44:12.002 --> 00:44:15.249
Why Nandi? Because Nandi is His disciple.

00:44:15.964 --> 00:44:18.321
Whatever He says, Nandi will nod his head

00:44:18.837 --> 00:44:21.888
He can tell Nandi anything, that's why Nandi is His dearest

00:44:22.825 --> 00:44:23.515
desciple.

00:44:23.825 --> 00:44:27.996
Now, He sat upon Nandi and arrived at His wedding venue

00:44:29.097 --> 00:44:30.922
So, Parvati Ji had no objection,

00:44:31.065 --> 00:44:33.628
but Her brother Vishnu Ji was little worried that,

00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:36.699
Why the bridegroom is coming in this manner?

00:44:37.766 --> 00:44:40.665
I do not mean that you become this kind of a groom,

00:44:41.547 --> 00:44:46.578
I dont mean that, but, still to overdo things of the whole world

00:44:46.812 --> 00:44:49.962
and spending unnecessarily is of no use.

00:44:51.712 --> 00:44:53.251
Be sensible.

00:44:53.852 --> 00:44:56.010
sensibility is your ornament.

00:44:57.209 --> 00:45:00.383
To accept every thing, whatever is available, is alright

00:45:00.867 --> 00:45:02.015
Food- alright.

00:45:02.245 --> 00:45:04.094
Now, they will go to someone's house for food

00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:06.086
and keep critisizing the host.

00:45:07.499 --> 00:45:09.049
may not be on their face but will come home and say

00:45:09.346 --> 00:45:11.073
" what kind of food was that?",

00:45:11.274 --> 00:45:12.847
If someone has cooked good food, still they will say,

00:45:13.048 --> 00:45:15.100
"you also cook the same way".

00:45:17.137 --> 00:45:20.589
The whole day attention on taste of the tongue is,

00:45:20.796 --> 00:45:23.740
too much in India, beyond the limit.

00:45:25.306 --> 00:45:27.075
And this should be reduced a bit.

00:45:27.536 --> 00:45:29.329
These people (foreign Yogis) eat your Indian food,

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:31.639
I have never heard any complaint.

00:45:32.822 --> 00:45:36.528
Although, you can never eat their Western food.

00:45:42.189 --> 00:45:45.783
But the way you have coated your whole self,

00:45:47.226 --> 00:45:49.756
will not let you get into the deeper jpy.

00:45:50.852 --> 00:45:52.642
The joy of Lord Shiva,

00:45:53.674 --> 00:45:57.569
to achieve that, People had told,

00:45:57.875 --> 00:46:00.851
that you renounce every thing, first renounce the world

00:46:01.438 --> 00:46:03.605
Go to Himalyas and stand on one leg.

00:46:04.256 --> 00:46:06.168
Wear minimum of clothes.

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:10.949
Take a dip in the river and then meditate with wet clothes.

00:46:11.747 --> 00:46:13.477
they used to torture the body.

00:46:13.707 --> 00:46:16.191
Even these days Gurus beat their disciples.

00:46:16.939 --> 00:46:20.906
They trouble a lot, realisation is not given so easily, no way.

00:46:21.906 --> 00:46:26.969
After giving all the trouble, then the desciples get realization.

00:46:27.671 --> 00:46:31.121
but their realization establishes them.

00:46:32.146 --> 00:46:33.066
strongly.

00:46:33.446 --> 00:46:35.759
But you all have realization just like that

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:39.062
and your previous habits are still linger on.

00:46:41.331 --> 00:46:44.492
THese problems are still with you, now what tod o with them?

00:46:45.009 --> 00:46:46.730
they need to be shaken off you.

00:46:46.945 --> 00:46:49.135
All these things which we have accumalated

00:46:49.336 --> 00:46:51.238
need to be pushed away, totally finished.

00:46:51.516 --> 00:46:53.381
And for that there is no need to make a show,

00:46:53.582 --> 00:46:57.087
renounce the world or leave the home and family.

00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.924
Any kind of,

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:03.067
Dravidi Pranyamas (holding the breath) are not required.

00:47:03.372 --> 00:47:06.075
But one thing is a must,

00:47:07.806 --> 00:47:09.663
your temptation of the taste buds,

00:47:10.385 --> 00:47:12.782
should be reduced slowly.

00:47:13.797 --> 00:47:15.874
Tastelessness should come inside you.

00:47:16.335 --> 00:47:17.525
it is very important.

00:47:17.914 --> 00:47:20.977
tasteleness of the tongue is a great quality.

00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:24.644
People get enraged if they do not get food of their own choice.

00:47:24.835 --> 00:47:29.929
They throw away their plates, beat their servants and what not?

00:47:30.879 --> 00:47:33.307
If you can conquer your taste buds,

00:47:35.871 --> 00:47:40.116
then many sweet shops will close down, in my openiun (laughs).

00:47:40.743 --> 00:47:41.878
However,

00:47:43.465 --> 00:47:45.155
I mean to say that,

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.830
the body should not be given much importance.

00:47:48.823 --> 00:47:50.505
If the body is given the comfort

00:47:50.838 --> 00:47:54.084
and supposing you sleep on a cot, you can't sleep on the ground.

00:47:54.363 --> 00:47:56.334
then for ten days sleep on the ground.

00:47:56.668 --> 00:47:58.008
How can you not sleep like that?

00:47:58.231 --> 00:48:01.556
Without enslaving your body, you cannot achieve anything.

00:48:01.905 --> 00:48:05.124
The talk about your comfort should come to an end.

00:48:05.347 --> 00:48:08.656
Many people are there who can not travel by bus.

00:48:09.687 --> 00:48:13.016
Because they want to go by car.

00:48:13.675 --> 00:48:17.532
Then borrow car from here, from there, sit in this car, that car

00:48:18.191 --> 00:48:19.958
But none of them will think

00:48:20.159 --> 00:48:23.164
"come, let me travel by bus today and see what happens?

00:48:24.179 --> 00:48:26.672
And earlier there were no buses also, people used to walk

00:48:27.021 --> 00:48:29.736
When we were in school, we used to walk five miles daily,

00:48:29.958 --> 00:48:32.189
though we had car and everything.

00:48:33.965 --> 00:48:36.512
Such were the parents of mine.

00:48:37.175 --> 00:48:39.929
But we were very fond of walking bare foot,,

00:48:40.088 --> 00:48:42.755
And without shoes, carry slippers in hand.

00:48:44.332 --> 00:48:47.514
Because of the vibrations it felt good to walk on the earth.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:48.936
You should also

00:48:49.158 --> 00:48:52.144
make the habit of walking without shoes and slippers.

00:48:52.986 --> 00:48:55.208
It is very important and very beneficiary.

00:48:55.507 --> 00:48:58.781
Mother earth will have your vibration and you wil alsol feel nice.

00:48:59.265 --> 00:49:03.789
In every field we have become too much of comfort loving people.

00:49:04.784 --> 00:49:07.966
We have become Just like few Nawabs of earlier days.

00:49:08.911 --> 00:49:11.339
And what did they get? we can get nothing from that.

00:49:11.506 --> 00:49:14.911
our lives whole will be wasted by becoming slaves to eaeryone.

00:49:15.069 --> 00:49:16.838
we have to reduce this slavery,

00:49:17.005 --> 00:49:20.894
and establish within us the essence (tatva) of Param Shiva.

00:49:21.715 --> 00:49:25.786
And for that it is essential that nothing else is important

00:49:26.422 --> 00:49:29.250
Today dress-up like this, tomorrow wear that dress,

00:49:29.449 --> 00:49:32.369
and with that this should match and this and so on.

00:49:32.782 --> 00:49:34.631
Whatever is available accept.

00:49:35.322 --> 00:49:37.658
Whatever comes your way wear that.

00:49:38.254 --> 00:49:41.920
It is alright, You will not be in any trouble because of that.

00:49:42.301 --> 00:49:45.782
On the contrary you will be happy that you are a contented person.

00:49:46.552 --> 00:49:49.996
Whatever I got, I have accepted wholeheartedly.

00:49:50.877 --> 00:49:52.991
Now a days, in our Nagpur,

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:55.642
I don't know if the situatoin is same here also,

00:49:55.968 --> 00:49:59.237
the cost of the gas sylinder has gone up by 16 RS.

00:49:59.698 --> 00:50:02.216
The photos of the women who opposed this came in the paper,

00:50:02.399 --> 00:50:03.962
all well dressed and made-up.

00:50:04.216 --> 00:50:07.581
I said that their powder iyself must be worth Rupees fifteen.

00:50:12.956 --> 00:50:17.573
Why should these kind of people go on a strike, for name's sake.

00:50:17.963 --> 00:50:18.923
What for?

00:50:19.161 --> 00:50:20.637
Because of the increase by 15 Rs.

00:50:20.756 --> 00:50:24.156
Can't they see that their salary also has increased.

00:50:25.752 --> 00:50:30.339
Earlier, Supposing, we were paying Rupees 20-25 to our servants,

00:50:30.474 --> 00:50:32.434
Today we pay 2500 Rs.

00:50:33.018 --> 00:50:36.573
He also complains, though he gets clothes and other things also.

00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:41.002
salaries are increased so much, would not the prices increase?

00:50:41.534 --> 00:50:44.320
When the salary increases, costs also rise up.

00:50:44.894 --> 00:50:49.039
There is a story that in Sri Lanka, labors were given

00:50:49.214 --> 00:50:51.023
one gold brick a day.

00:50:51.597 --> 00:50:53.999
One person went to recieve gold bricks.

00:50:55.003 --> 00:50:57.520
He found that, after working for one day

00:50:57.774 --> 00:50:59.410
he recieved two glod bricks.

00:50:59.822 --> 00:51:03.194
after that he went to a barber shop for shave.

00:51:03.507 --> 00:51:07.322
He asked the barber “What are the charges?” “Two bricks”.

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:09.497
As the income, so the expenses.

00:51:09.982 --> 00:51:11.307
It is a mtter of descretion.

00:51:11.508 --> 00:51:16.116
what is the point in grumbling over the price rise, this and that.

00:51:17.655 --> 00:51:21.636
How much your salary has risen? By a huge number.

00:51:22.434 --> 00:51:24.762
Then why to keep crying about the price rise?

00:51:25.024 --> 00:51:27.675
When the salary increases, price-hike has to happen.

00:51:27.881 --> 00:51:30.921
Your salary has increased and the prices to remain as it is?

00:51:31.384 --> 00:51:34.463
Its a very simple thing, if we learn this,

00:51:34.678 --> 00:51:38.115
then socially also we could achieve Shiv Tattva.

00:51:39.044 --> 00:51:41.774
Now, Gandhi Ji was an amazing person.

00:51:42.864 --> 00:51:46.073
I was with Him in his Ashram, nothing used to happen to me.

00:51:46.399 --> 00:51:47.764
But others used to cry.

00:51:48.010 --> 00:51:49.732
Because His policy was,

00:51:50.272 --> 00:51:53.825
AAAA! clean everyone's bathroom, everyone's,

00:51:54.159 --> 00:51:57.373
guest's and everyone's, there was no sweeper at all.

00:51:58.222 --> 00:51:59.658
(Shri Mataji laughing)

00:52:00.295 --> 00:52:03.228
Wash your own clothes, wash your own plates.

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:08.322
And the meal consisted of boiled food with mustard oil on top of it.

00:52:09.227 --> 00:52:13.092
Now, tell me how many Indians can eat that type of food?

00:52:13.489 --> 00:52:16.284
People used to stay there for 2-3 days and then run away.

00:52:16.547 --> 00:52:17.473
This was the situation.

00:52:17.689 --> 00:52:21.173
Now, you people also should learn to controle your taste buds.

00:52:21.681 --> 00:52:23.815
Now, as far as tastelessness is concerned,

00:52:24.282 --> 00:52:26.329
I don't know how you can develop that,

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:31.409
But you should eat only boiled food for a few days.

00:52:40.526 --> 00:52:42.850
No mother would say such a thing to her children,

00:52:43.065 --> 00:52:46.128
what do I do? It is damaging your Shiva Tattva in you.

00:52:46.392 --> 00:52:48.441
If all of your attention is in eating tasty food,

00:52:48.647 --> 00:52:50.226
then your Shiva Tattva will disappear

00:52:50.427 --> 00:52:52.663
and all the efforts taken will go a waste.

00:52:53.261 --> 00:52:57.349
So, to get engrossed too much in eating, is not so good.

00:52:59.056 --> 00:53:02.048
In olden days people used to observe fasts once a while,

00:53:02.376 --> 00:53:03.909
something or the other,

00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:07.410
They used to sacrifice.

00:53:08.118 --> 00:53:10.486
But now a days it is very difficult to say,

00:53:10.716 --> 00:53:14.454
that if you become contented, become satisfied,

00:53:14.788 --> 00:53:18.219
then it is not necessary for you, absolutely not required,

00:53:18.418 --> 00:53:21.989
that all the time you talk about eating and drinking

00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:24.045
and invite others for supper.

00:53:24.431 --> 00:53:27.550
Then in India we have caste system.

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.223
Kayasth are separate,

00:53:30.477 --> 00:53:34.532
Hindu brahmins are separate, and others are separate, even now.

00:53:35.559 --> 00:53:36.519
Now what has happened,

00:53:36.839 --> 00:53:39.338
is that all the kayashth Sahaja Yogis have become one group,

00:53:39.797 --> 00:53:41.677
Brahmin Sahaja Yogis have become one,

00:53:41.826 --> 00:53:43.513
Now you all have become Sahaja Yogis,

00:53:43.729 --> 00:53:46.219
then why are you still worried about brahminism?

00:53:46.473 --> 00:53:49.560
Then kayasth will invite other kayasths  for a meal.

00:53:50.092 --> 00:53:52.347
And Brahmin will invite other brahmins for a meal.

00:53:52.728 --> 00:53:54.617
If you have to do this kind of stupidity,

00:53:54.818 --> 00:53:56.855
then why did you come to Sahaja Yoga?

00:53:57.147 --> 00:54:00.432
There is no Caste and creed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:00.972 --> 00:54:04.408
When you could not leave the fundamental wrong thing,

00:54:04.623 --> 00:54:06.623
then what else can you leave?

00:54:07.234 --> 00:54:09.226
Did Shiv Ji have caste and creed?

00:54:09.837 --> 00:54:12.535
People with one blind eye,

00:54:12.948 --> 00:54:15.487
some with broken leg, some with broken hands,

00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:18.004
this kind of handicapped people

00:54:18.226 --> 00:54:20.535
accompanied Him in His marriage procession.

00:54:20.989 --> 00:54:27.931
So, it is against Shiva Tattva to be concerned too much about,

00:54:28.241 --> 00:54:34.758
food that "I am very perticular that the food should be like this".

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:38.242
And then separate food for Kayasth, separate for Brahmins,

00:54:38.523 --> 00:54:41.419
separate for other casts and separate for Rajputs,

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:43.014
separate for every one.

00:54:43.396 --> 00:54:44.975
Now, we want only that food.

00:54:45.316 --> 00:54:49.005
I have never understood, till date I could not understand,

00:54:49.252 --> 00:54:52.735
if there is more pleasure in eating different foods,

00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:55.771
then why do these people ask only this type of food.

00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:00.239
What is the reason? For Bengalies Bengali food,

00:55:01.057 --> 00:55:03.096
For Madrasis, Madrasi food,

00:55:04.457 --> 00:55:07.248
Once I asked in our airforce,

00:55:07.449 --> 00:55:11.304
I mean in airlines why there is no good standard food?

00:55:11.886 --> 00:55:16.155
They said "mother, tell us which is India's standard food"?

00:55:17.171 --> 00:55:18.583
That is very true?

00:55:19.488 --> 00:55:22.392
If you prepare some food, they will say "this is madrasi food".

00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:27.424
Madrasi will say "this is Bihari food", this and that and that.

00:55:28.214 --> 00:55:32.325
So, you should know to eat all types of food.

00:55:35.656 --> 00:55:37.997
Because everything starts from the mouth itself.

00:55:38.172 --> 00:55:39.370
This Vaikhari (Marathi word)

00:55:39.561 --> 00:55:40.592
Meaning tongue,

00:55:40.759 --> 00:55:44.171
in our tongue also (while we speak) there should be sweetness)

00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:45.754
(not clear)

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:49.030
In the smiles of some people it feels sometimes,

00:55:49.174 --> 00:55:51.994
as if Ravana is emerging out of their mouth.

00:55:53.237 --> 00:55:55.435
Then what can be said about their speech?

00:55:55.772 --> 00:55:59.672
And when they talk, it feels as if some chandika is talking,

00:55:59.824 --> 00:56:02.363
perticularly women exhibit this.

00:56:03.641 --> 00:56:05.871
And men also display such action.

00:56:06.644 --> 00:56:09.231
different peculiar things have come up now

00:56:09.684 --> 00:56:10.897
In this

00:56:11.922 --> 00:56:13.437
Where is Shiva Tattva?

00:56:14.272 --> 00:56:17.601
Lord Shiva is the ocean of love,

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:21.910
He bestows boons even on Rakshasas.

00:56:24.025 --> 00:56:26.731
Lord Shiva has bestowed boons even on rakshasas.

00:56:26.898 --> 00:56:29.372
If we have to awaken His Tattava within us,

00:56:29.705 --> 00:56:33.364
then how could we get entangled in petty matters like this?

00:56:34.324 --> 00:56:36.538
How can we do this? Tell me.

00:56:37.894 --> 00:56:41.385
The way in which we criticize each other

00:56:41.894 --> 00:56:44.892
Some say he is "high"  some say he is" low"

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.115
it is not like Lord Shiva.

00:56:48.052 --> 00:56:52.130
The streams of love are flowing within Lord Shiva,

00:56:53.421 --> 00:56:56.111
And while flowing in this ocean of love –

00:56:56.834 --> 00:56:58.484
you should not say

00:56:59.548 --> 00:57:01.994
such baseless things.

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:04.478
There is no use of it.

00:57:06.209 --> 00:57:07.582
Mutual love,

00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.923
mutual understanding

00:57:10.769 --> 00:57:11.792
and

00:57:12.539 --> 00:57:16.332
joy among one another should be enjoyed.

00:57:17.255 --> 00:57:18.445
Now it is definite,

00:57:18.945 --> 00:57:22.032
that Sahaja Yogis do not fight with each other, I have seen that.

00:57:22.215 --> 00:57:24.540
they meet each other they meet with love.

00:57:24.927 --> 00:57:25.863
But still,

00:57:26.117 --> 00:57:29.291
even now very petty matters which are very personnel,

00:57:29.617 --> 00:57:32.985
like eating- drinking, getting around and moving around

00:57:33.319 --> 00:57:34.946
need to be corrected.

00:57:36.493 --> 00:57:39.287
If we do that it will be wonderful.

00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:43.160
Your attention will go towards your heart,

00:57:43.382 --> 00:57:45.644
will not remain in these things.

00:57:46.668 --> 00:57:48.469
Will not stay in these matters.

00:57:48.921 --> 00:57:51.071
This disorder is more in foreign countries.

00:57:51.437 --> 00:57:54.913
Because there, one better than the other,

00:57:55.453 --> 00:57:57.962
manufacturing units are available for different things.

00:57:58.288 --> 00:58:02.399
And the wearer of those things starts thinking very high of himself.

00:58:04.689 --> 00:58:07.649
Perticulerly in Italy this is too much in vogue.

00:58:08.094 --> 00:58:09.030
But

00:58:09.562 --> 00:58:13.022
you should not get caught in all these things.

00:58:13.946 --> 00:58:15.929
You Lead a simple life.

00:58:16.533 --> 00:58:20.056
In our country, people who lead a simple life

00:58:20.972 --> 00:58:22.488
have attained great heights.

00:58:23.282 --> 00:58:24.980
Others can not achieve this.

00:58:26.174 --> 00:58:29.833
In olden days, since Gandhi Ji asked every one to wear Khadi cloth,

00:58:30.834 --> 00:58:32.770
everyone obeyed and wore khadi.

00:58:33.606 --> 00:58:35.717
He made this rule

00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:38.770
and set everybody right.

00:58:39.382 --> 00:58:42.437
But now you have to set yourself right.

00:58:42.959 --> 00:58:44.490
Because you yourself are

00:58:44.912 --> 00:58:46.832
enlightened by your spirits.

00:58:47.658 --> 00:58:52.918
You are under the direct protection of Shri Shiva.

00:58:54.339 --> 00:58:56.458
You have to correct your own self.

00:58:57.022 --> 00:58:59.569
You don't need to correct others,

00:58:59.864 --> 00:59:01.435
Just correct yourself,

00:59:01.618 --> 00:59:04.260
and feel blessed that you are a self realized person.

00:59:04.467 --> 00:59:06.030
How many were there earlier?

00:59:06.430 --> 00:59:09.214
Only a few of them and they also used to get killed.

00:59:09.579 --> 00:59:13.333
Today you are in thousands, So start doing this.

00:59:14.246 --> 00:59:15.960
Sweetness in your talk,

00:59:16.284 --> 00:59:18.189
not superficially but from the heart.

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:22.308
when you talk to people from your heart, no one mistakes it.

00:59:23.719 --> 00:59:25.243
So you talk from your heart.

00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:27.878
With children, with elderly people,

00:59:28.117 --> 00:59:30.497
following the bounderies of good conduct,

00:59:30.778 --> 00:59:34.547
when you make yourself happy,

00:59:34.865 --> 00:59:36.920
you will make others also happy.

00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:39.809
But, within you  this

00:59:40.769 --> 00:59:42.686
blessings of Shri Shiva should be there,

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.337
which can make you contented,

00:59:46.393 --> 00:59:48.313
Nothing else can make you that.

00:59:48.598 --> 00:59:52.383
So look within yourself and see if "I am contented or not?

00:59:53.042 --> 00:59:54.843
"Am I satisfied or not"?

00:59:55.122 --> 01:00:00.645
"Do I quarrel with others over small – small things"?

01:00:01.455 --> 01:00:04.257
"Or find faults with them"?

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:07.360
Then definitely there is something wrong with me.

01:00:07.614 --> 01:00:11.261
And, by putting your attention on that also, you can get cleansed.

01:00:11.601 --> 01:00:15.434
Until you see your shortcomings, how could you cleanse them?

01:00:16.125 --> 01:00:17.994
This cleansing is much needed.

01:00:18.193 --> 01:00:19.747
And only by this cleansing,

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:25.966
You can visualize that God almighty within yourself,

01:00:26.203 --> 01:00:28.804
And other people also can this bliss.

01:00:29.146 --> 01:00:31.661
Infinite blessings.

01:00:45.246 --> 01:00:48.650
It's a very long lecture I have given in Hindi language;

01:00:48.989 --> 01:00:52.976
and because there are very few, also, Sahaja Yogis from abroad.

01:00:54.016 --> 01:00:56.661
What I was telling them was that about the

01:00:56.955 --> 01:01:01.272
Principle of Shiva is in your heart,

01:01:02.209 --> 01:01:04.336
and that reflection is

01:01:04.471 --> 01:01:07.907
not on a chakra, but on a… like a mirror.

01:01:08.458 --> 01:01:12.727
Now, whatever is aaaa visible of you

01:01:14.142 --> 01:01:15.713
is this mirror.

01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:19.316
In this mirror, what reflection you have?

01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:24.727
Do you have a reflection, which is clear, clean?

01:01:25.125 --> 01:01:27.696
Have you cleaned your heart,

01:01:27.974 --> 01:01:34.047
have you cleaned your aaaann  mirror that is reflecting?

01:01:34.895 --> 01:01:36.657
That is what one has to see.

01:01:37.181 --> 01:01:40.918
Now, what I told them at length was this, that how

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:44.680
there are six enemies we have got.

01:01:45.426 --> 01:01:51.005
And all these six enemies, one after another, try to corrupt us.

01:01:51.894 --> 01:01:53.854
Out of that, I have told them about five,

01:01:54.055 --> 01:01:58.944
The sixth one doesn’t exist much in India, which we call as lust,

01:01:59.555 --> 01:02:00.745
it's much less.

01:02:01.032 --> 01:02:04.628
But, for foreign countries one has to know

01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:07.937
that it is one of the major things that they have

01:02:08.216 --> 01:02:10.515
in the West, because they think lustful life,

01:02:10.716 --> 01:02:12.415
is the only life worth living.

01:02:13.194 --> 01:02:14.955
Beyond that, is Shiva.

01:02:16.726 --> 01:02:20.050
And that’s why we have to understood,

01:02:20.273 --> 01:02:23.992
that we have to understand that in our heart,

01:02:25.095 --> 01:02:28.968
the reflection of Shiva is only possible,

01:02:29.372 --> 01:02:32.841
in complete form when we have cleaned our heart.

01:02:33.742 --> 01:02:39.519
To have malice for others, to have lust for others,

01:02:39.996 --> 01:02:43.439
to have anger for others,

01:02:44.559 --> 01:02:47.114
to have envy for others,

01:02:48.507 --> 01:02:51.343
all these reactions within us act,

01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:56.168
and our heart becomes like a stone, it cannot reflect.

01:02:57.467 --> 01:02:59.283
So, if you have to reflect

01:02:59.673 --> 01:03:02.442
the quality of Shiva, which is very important today,

01:03:02.594 --> 01:03:03.794
in this Kali Yuga.

01:03:04.292 --> 01:03:09.116
very… there are very few people who are really reflecting

01:03:09.378 --> 01:03:13.886
the image of Shiva in their own character.

01:03:14.577 --> 01:03:18.108
So, it is important to watch yourself and see for yourself,

01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:22.079
what’s wrong with you? Where am I… where is my attention going?

01:03:22.468 --> 01:03:24.619
Where am I going? What am I doing?

01:03:24.904 --> 01:03:28.825
If you go on judging yourself and not others.

01:03:29.302 --> 01:03:33.738
Also, in… one of the western things is that, they have a

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:37.921
aaaan right to criticize others, everybody.

01:03:38.652 --> 01:03:40.422
I like it, I don’t like it”.

01:03:40.946 --> 01:03:43.247
Who are you? Why do you say such a thing?

01:03:43.914 --> 01:03:47.199
Somebody had made a beautiful, say, arrangement for you;

01:03:47.504 --> 01:03:50.607
you sit in his house and nicely say, “I don’t like it,”

01:03:51.514 --> 01:03:53.014
to hurt that person.

01:03:55.201 --> 01:03:58.669
After all, who are you? What do you think of yourself?

01:04:00.011 --> 01:04:01.130
Who are you to judge?

01:04:01.352 --> 01:04:04.193
For Sahaja Yoga… Yogis, is prohibited

01:04:04.566 --> 01:04:06.876
to say, “I like” and “I don’t like.”

01:04:08.217 --> 01:04:09.312
Is prohibited.

01:04:10.932 --> 01:04:13.558
Look at Shiva. He likes everything.

01:04:14.366 --> 01:04:16.995
What He wears? Also snakes.

01:04:18.055 --> 01:04:19.947
He likes all kinds of animals.

01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:22.281
Every type of thing

01:04:22.622 --> 01:04:25.926
that we think is not good, ugly, for Him they are not.

01:04:26.451 --> 01:04:30.410
For example, in His wedding He took with Him, in His “Barat”,

01:04:31.371 --> 01:04:34.064
people who were all infirm.

01:04:34.366 --> 01:04:37.596
Some people had one leg; some people had

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:42.455
limbs broken down, Some had only one eye.

01:04:42.717 --> 01:04:44.868
All such people He carried with them.

01:04:45.225 --> 01:04:49.971
To Him, these people were very dear and He looked after them,

01:04:50.357 --> 01:04:52.611
because He is the source of joy.

01:04:53.302 --> 01:04:55.269
He is the One who gives us joy.

01:04:55.751 --> 01:04:57.925
And the One that makes us joyous.

01:04:58.226 --> 01:05:02.480
The real joy is only possible if, in your heart,

01:05:02.997 --> 01:05:04.149
His reflection is there.

01:05:04.515 --> 01:05:06.594
But if your heart is full of all things,

01:05:07.356 --> 01:05:10.919
that once I have described, it becomes a dirty,

01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:14.563
very, very dirty mirror.

01:05:15.171 --> 01:05:19.213
Very surprising, I told them also, compared to Indians,

01:05:19.443 --> 01:05:23.086
Westerners are not so particular… Western Sahaja Yogis

01:05:23.388 --> 01:05:25.705
are not so particular about their comfort.

01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:28.872
Though they come from a very materialistic surrounding,

01:05:29.047 --> 01:05:30.316
they are not so much bothered.

01:05:30.496 --> 01:05:33.559
They can live anywhere, they can be happy anywhere.

01:05:33.694 --> 01:05:37.454
That’s a very good stage they have reached and that’s what’s

01:05:37.692 --> 01:05:39.549
the Indians must try to follow

01:05:39.819 --> 01:05:42.462
and don’t pay attention to nonsensical things.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:46.778
It is not necessary to waste your energy on nonsensical thing.

01:05:47.619 --> 01:05:50.556
Then only you can have a real Bhakti for

01:05:51.356 --> 01:05:53.562
your Self, for your Atma

01:05:53.785 --> 01:05:58.638
and that is what needed today, that your Spirit should shine

01:05:58.797 --> 01:06:04.748
in your character, in your behavior and in your personality.

01:06:05.629 --> 01:06:08.680
If that happens, then you have achieved,

01:06:08.856 --> 01:06:11.807
what Sahaja Yoga wanted to do for you.

01:06:12.356 --> 01:06:15.409
Is important today, very important. If you read

01:06:15.631 --> 01:06:18.298
the newspapers, you can’t read it.

01:06:18.457 --> 01:06:23.266
And what you need is to change; the transformation;

01:06:23.774 --> 01:06:26.496
as we in Hindi call it ‘pariwartan’,

01:06:26.973 --> 01:06:30.853
of human beings into Selfhood, into Self-awareness,

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.373
into the Spirit.

01:06:33.769 --> 01:06:35.949
This has to be done, and the time has come;

01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:37.983
this evolutionary process has started.

01:06:38.197 --> 01:06:40.146
There are so many of them who have got it.

01:06:40.392 --> 01:06:44.071
Now the old saints and

01:06:44.478 --> 01:06:47.263
people who were gurus, real gurus,

01:06:47.708 --> 01:06:50.270
they used to really

01:06:51.144 --> 01:06:52.756
test the disciples

01:06:52.986 --> 01:06:57.167
by making them stand on their heads for years together,

01:06:57.390 --> 01:07:00.659
sometimes put them in the water, do all kinds of things.

01:07:02.271 --> 01:07:05.878
They used to beat them and they were very harsh,

01:07:06.323 --> 01:07:07.806
testing all of them.

01:07:08.426 --> 01:07:12.171
And then only, one of them used to get realization.

01:07:13.621 --> 01:07:18.025
Now, what I thought of – its takes too much time,

01:07:18.675 --> 01:07:20.014
to cleanse them,

01:07:20.276 --> 01:07:25.651
to put them into all kinds of dresses, this that,

01:07:25.867 --> 01:07:29.231
send them to Himalayas or to Gobi Desert.

01:07:30.065 --> 01:07:32.025
I thought it will take too much time.

01:07:32.451 --> 01:07:35.228
I said why not first enlighten them?

01:07:35.754 --> 01:07:37.008
Give them the light.

01:07:37.290 --> 01:07:39.342
In that light they can see their problems

01:07:39.543 --> 01:07:41.691
and they will themselves correct themself.

01:07:41.951 --> 01:07:45.277
They will be their own guru, and it was successful.

01:07:46.047 --> 01:07:47.134
It was good.

01:07:47.464 --> 01:07:50.253
Now you can see for yourself what you are doing,

01:07:50.742 --> 01:07:53.718
what is your problem, what makes you

01:07:55.084 --> 01:07:57.536
so much different from others

01:07:57.881 --> 01:07:59.904
and what will elevate you.

01:08:00.531 --> 01:08:05.201
Because Sadashiva’s place is above the head,

01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:08.598
above your thoughts, above your mind,

01:08:08.885 --> 01:08:11.114
above your emotions. It’s here,

01:08:11.869 --> 01:08:13.729
and you have to cross this limit.

01:08:14.253 --> 01:08:17.880
Only when you do not react to things, and also

01:08:18.324 --> 01:08:22.939
to you nothing is important than Shiva,

01:08:23.892 --> 01:08:25.415
then only it will work out.

01:08:25.915 --> 01:08:28.351
So, in some things Indians have to learn,

01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:31.930
and in some things you foreigners have to learn.

01:08:32.447 --> 01:08:35.327
So many things you have done, I must thank you very much.

01:08:35.498 --> 01:08:37.584
People used to think that I cannot do anything.

01:08:37.735 --> 01:08:38.814
you have given up drinking,

01:08:39.015 --> 01:08:41.679
you have given up all kinds of bad habits,

01:08:41.915 --> 01:08:45.010
you are no more womanizers, your attention is so clean,

01:08:45.211 --> 01:08:48.489
so many things you have done, which is really praise-worthy.

01:08:48.815 --> 01:08:52.280
But still, you must learn that still,

01:08:52.481 --> 01:08:56.006
there are certain things lingering, which must be cleared out

01:08:56.514 --> 01:08:59.379
and must be absolutely finished.

01:08:59.701 --> 01:09:02.176
You don’t have very much politics

01:09:02.375 --> 01:09:06.801
but sometimes there is also politics, aaah group forming is there.

01:09:06.993 --> 01:09:09.294
All this has to go away, because for Shiva,

01:09:09.495 --> 01:09:12.201
what is this? The whole universe is at His feet.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:13.744
To Him

01:09:14.839 --> 01:09:17.432
to have a one group here and a one group there,

01:09:17.758 --> 01:09:18.964
all that doesn’t matter.

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:22.940
To Him, it doesn’t come into His head, you see.

01:09:23.044 --> 01:09:27.445
For a person like a very big ocean, it touches many shores.

01:09:28.295 --> 01:09:33.334
But in itself it is a big ocean, In the same way is Shiva principle,

01:09:33.884 --> 01:09:36.844
and you all should develop that principle of Shiva.

01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:38.916
And then see the joy.

01:09:39.138 --> 01:09:43.007
the joy of this great ocean of love.

01:09:44.079 --> 01:09:46.285
May God bless you.
