00:00:05.047 --> 00:00:10.889
First, I‘ll speak in Hindi language

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.750
and then in English language.

00:00:20.688 --> 00:00:26.962
Today we have assembled here to worship Shri Maha Deva,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.370
Shri Shiva Shankar.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.024
In the name of Shankarji,

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:41.826
many organizations have come up in this world.

00:00:42.027 --> 00:00:47.664
Because of Adi Shankaracharya’s emphasis,

00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:52.922
worshipping ShivJi became very popular among people.

00:00:53.123 --> 00:00:58.695
And in South India, two types of sects came up:

00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:02.088
one which were called Shaivites,

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.639
and the others were called Vaishnavites.

00:01:06.476 --> 00:01:11.135
Now Shaivites are the worshippers of Lord Shiva,

00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:15.170
and the Vaishnavites worship Lord Vishnu.

00:01:16.286 --> 00:01:22.025
In our country we are experts in creating divisions.

00:01:22.196 --> 00:01:25.497
We divide the Deities as well;

00:01:25.698 --> 00:01:28.349
and when we try to integrate them,

00:01:28.516 --> 00:01:31.408
then things become even worse.

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:35.562
For example, a new thing has come up, called Ayyappa.

00:01:35.763 --> 00:01:38.586
It is a very wrong thing.

00:01:38.787 --> 00:01:43.237
And in that it is shown,

00:01:43.438 --> 00:01:47.628
that when Lord Vishnu assumed the form of "Mohini",

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:51.217
then she got a child from Lord Shiva.

00:01:51.418 --> 00:01:53.748
How is it even possible?

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:58.173
Such wrong ideas are created and widespread in our country,

00:01:58.374 --> 00:02:01.477
and then different beliefs groups are formed based on these ideas.

00:02:01.678 --> 00:02:04.810
When Indians find some or other reason to fight,

00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:07.418
they become very happy.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.342
If they have nothing to fight over,

00:02:11.543 --> 00:02:17.858
then, they create something from their own imaginations.

00:02:18.556 --> 00:02:24.146
Actually these two aspects are connected with each other

00:02:24.347 --> 00:02:28.957
as sun is with sun light,

00:02:29.158 --> 00:02:33.087
word with its meaning, moon with the moonlight.

00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:39.924
Meaning that the "Sopan Marga" which is there,

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:47.181
which we call as Sushumna nadi, which is the central path,

00:02:47.382 --> 00:02:49.867
it is the path of Lord Vishnu.

00:02:50.068 --> 00:02:54.634
And through this path we attain the Shiva tattwa.

00:02:54.835 --> 00:02:59.547
So the destination is Shiva tattwa, Shri Shiva,

00:02:59.748 --> 00:03:04.554
and the path is made by Lord Vishnu.

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:08.285
To create this path Shri Vishnu and Shri Adishakti

00:03:08.507 --> 00:03:10.189
have done a lot of hardwork.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.569
Lord Shiva had no role in it.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.648
He sits comfortably in his seat,

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.839
not bothering about who is coming or who is not coming.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.767
So, to attain this Shiva tattwa,

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:24.761
we should go through this Vishnu path (Sushumna nadi)

00:03:24.962 --> 00:03:30.130
and for that, we have to first correct the chakras within us.

00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:32.562
When the centers are corrected,

00:03:32.763 --> 00:03:35.307
our Vishnu path opens up.

00:03:35.508 --> 00:03:41.304
And along with that, we gradually start ascending.

00:03:41.505 --> 00:03:44.624
I have told you about all these centers, many a times.

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:49.299
But there is a chakra in the heart also, which we call `Left Heart’.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.535
This is not a heart chakra in essence,

00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:58.469
in a way, heart is the reflection,

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.588
the reflection of Shri Mahadeva.

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:07.165
The abode of Shiva is above everything,

00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:11.713
beyond the mind, beyond the thoughts.

00:04:11.914 --> 00:04:14.828
To attain this kind of tattwa,

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:18.210
first and foremost we should pay attention

00:04:18.411 --> 00:04:23.181
and see how pure our heart is.

00:04:24.984 --> 00:04:30.999
Inside our heart, we nurture a lot of dirt.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.994
For example, we feel jealous of someone.

00:04:36.615 --> 00:04:42.962
feeling jealous like somebody has been evil to you.

00:04:43.163 --> 00:04:46.851
Even if they might have harmed you also, troubled you

00:04:47.052 --> 00:04:50.363
there is no use becoming jeolous of them.

00:04:50.564 --> 00:04:52.602
If your heart is clean

00:04:52.803 --> 00:04:55.499
then the mirror within you,

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.997
in which the God Almighty's reflection is going to fall,

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:00.794
will remain clear.

00:05:00.995 --> 00:05:04.868
But if you have jealousy within,

00:05:06.123 --> 00:05:08.133
then the mirror will not remain clean

00:05:08.334 --> 00:05:10.932
and the reflection of God will also not be perfect.

00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:13.450
To have enmity towards anyone

00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:21.273
and to have anger or ill feelings in the heart towards anyone,

00:05:21.474 --> 00:05:23.599
is very wrong.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.660
That is why Christ said that: "Forgive everyone".

00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:31.314
To forgive is extremely important.

00:05:31.515 --> 00:05:37.881
And before and after Christ many saints have said the same thing,

00:05:38.082 --> 00:05:39.783
that forgive everybody.

00:05:39.984 --> 00:05:45.005
The moment you forgive, immediately Lord Shiva,

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.550
takes the situation in His hands.

00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:53.741
The subtlest power of all is that of Shri Mahadev.

00:05:53.942 --> 00:06:00.322
And He, then completely punishes that person,

00:06:00.523 --> 00:06:04.107
totally punishes him.

00:06:04.308 --> 00:06:08.056
This is the responsibility of Lord Mahadev, not yours.

00:06:08.257 --> 00:06:12.157
Therefore to be jealous of anyone is very bad.

00:06:12.358 --> 00:06:16.174
But I find that there is lot of jealousy even in Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:16.375 --> 00:06:19.455
Sahaja Yogis are jealous of one another.

00:06:19.656 --> 00:06:22.750
If one person is made trustee, the other one is not,

00:06:22.951 --> 00:06:24.565
then he becomes jealous.

00:06:24.766 --> 00:06:27.242
This trusteeship and all has no meaning,

00:06:27.417 --> 00:06:29.464
you all know it is a myth.

00:06:29.665 --> 00:06:32.057
Your Mother has created all this drama

00:06:32.264 --> 00:06:34.424
and has spread a web of maya.

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:37.675
Even then the mind of the people gets disturbed;

00:06:37.908 --> 00:06:40.381
One person's mind gets disturbed

00:06:40.588 --> 00:06:42.707
and for the other the heart gets disturbed!

00:06:42.908 --> 00:06:45.740
I do not understand what should I do!

00:06:45.941 --> 00:06:48.812
Such a big work is happening in so many countries,

00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:52.508
so I can communicate with any one person only, right?

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:55.736
However, things are getting sorted out slowly,

00:06:55.937 --> 00:06:59.601
but still you will be surprised

00:06:59.802 --> 00:07:02.760
that even now there is lot of discussion

00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:06.213
about who is the leader and who is what?

00:07:06.414 --> 00:07:14.866
Second thing, there is a so-called "blessing" for us, Indians,

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:20.159
that jealousy arises in money matters.

00:07:20.492 --> 00:07:24.667
Even in Sahaja Yoga there is jealousy on money matters.

00:07:25.138 --> 00:07:28.413
Someone has got more money and some less.

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:31.058
Even while doing Sahaja Yoga work

00:07:31.336 --> 00:07:34.293
people see how much money one gets,

00:07:34.476 --> 00:07:36.441
and who gives how much money?

00:07:36.642 --> 00:07:39.323
If a person's heart gets involved with money

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:42.860
he becomes useless for Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:43.061 --> 00:07:49.564
Because his heart gets covered with materialism.

00:07:49.765 --> 00:07:55.002
If any kind of materialism has affected you,

00:07:55.203 --> 00:07:58.290
then it is very difficult for you to ascend.

00:07:58.491 --> 00:08:00.137
This is the speciality of our country.

00:08:00.338 --> 00:08:02.399
I have not seen it so much in foreign countries.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.817
But here it is prominent.

00:08:05.018 --> 00:08:08.284
I think, in Russia and Eastern Block countries

00:08:08.485 --> 00:08:10.324
there is very little of wealth,

00:08:10.525 --> 00:08:12.530
but they are not bothered at all.

00:08:12.753 --> 00:08:14.625
They don't think about money at all.

00:08:14.768 --> 00:08:18.636
But their heart is so pure, so very pure.

00:08:18.837 --> 00:08:22.229
And only with the pure heart, devotion (bhakti) is possible.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:27.132
We all, before doing prayers, wash our feet and take bath.

00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:30.225
But if we bathe our heart

00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:36.023
and ask God that whatever negativities are there within us,

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:38.449
to please remove them and purify us,

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.137
then it will be much better.

00:08:41.338 --> 00:08:44.907
Third thing, that is within us,

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:47.931
are the six enemies (shadripu).

00:08:48.147 --> 00:08:52.766
Shri Krishna has emphasised that krodha (anger) is the worst thing.

00:08:52.967 --> 00:08:54.858
Everything emanates from anger.

00:08:55.059 --> 00:08:57.049
A person shows anger initially,

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.150
then he gets into delusion.

00:08:59.351 --> 00:09:02.150
Then he thinks: "Why did I say all that, I should not have said it",

00:09:02.351 --> 00:09:03.615
and so on.

00:09:03.816 --> 00:09:06.780
But he goes out of self-control, when he gets angry.

00:09:06.984 --> 00:09:10.592
In the fit of anger he loses control over himself.

00:09:10.793 --> 00:09:12.671
He goes out of self-control

00:09:12.872 --> 00:09:16.080
and he spits out words, which are meaningless.

00:09:16.281 --> 00:09:20.444
The dirt he has been accumulating since long in his heart,

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:24.150
comes out of his mouth.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.606
We have to beware of this krodha.

00:09:26.807 --> 00:09:30.089
"Why does this anger come?" - we should pay attention to this,

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.790
that why do we get angry.

00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:35.197
There are some who are angry with a particular person,

00:09:35.425 --> 00:09:38.143
there are some who are angry with the society.

00:09:38.344 --> 00:09:41.633
Like this, people get angry in different ways.

00:09:41.834 --> 00:09:44.919
Why does this anger come to us?

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:48.507
"Why do we get angry?" - we should think that.

00:09:48.708 --> 00:09:50.703
Many people have told Me that,

00:09:50.904 --> 00:09:55.604
"Mother, if someone speaks against You, we get very angry".

00:09:55.805 --> 00:09:57.454
I feel like laughing at this.

00:09:57.655 --> 00:10:02.114
If anybody talks against Me, then I really feel like laughing.

00:10:02.315 --> 00:10:05.880
Because it doesn't make any sense. What is there to talk against Me?

00:10:06.081 --> 00:10:09.210
I am just sharing my love, even then if they speak against Me,

00:10:09.411 --> 00:10:10.629
then what can be done?

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:13.132
But some people have a crooked mind,

00:10:13.331 --> 00:10:15.883
so we should only pity them.

00:10:16.084 --> 00:10:19.634
One should think that such people are big fools.

00:10:19.835 --> 00:10:24.069
When a person is full of anger, then our attitude towards him,

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:28.859
should be very polite.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.812
This attitude may also cool down his anger.

00:10:32.013 --> 00:10:35.964
In our country there are different kinds of angry people.

00:10:36.165 --> 00:10:37.932
There are institutions for that

00:10:38.133 --> 00:10:40.943
who spread with their anger: "Hit this person, hit that person",

00:10:41.144 --> 00:10:43.183
"Beat up this person, beat up that person".

00:10:43.384 --> 00:10:46.501
And this is also becoming an issue at the social level.

00:10:46.702 --> 00:10:50.560
This is a very terrifying situation.

00:10:50.761 --> 00:10:52.360
To beat and thrash people,

00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:57.235
and for that purpose to form an army

00:10:57.436 --> 00:11:00.347
or prepare some weapons to beat and hurt people

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.148
is very terrifying.

00:11:02.349 --> 00:11:09.187
However, for protection, a person is equipped with these weapons,

00:11:09.388 --> 00:11:11.137
it is not a big deal.

00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:14.217
However, if he is a devotee of the God Almighty,

00:11:14.418 --> 00:11:16.710
he doesn’t require these weapons.

00:11:16.911 --> 00:11:19.999
This kind of a person is always protected.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.725
If Shri Mahadev resides within a person,

00:11:25.926 --> 00:11:28.510
who can dare to touch such a person,

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.634
who can destroy him?

00:11:30.835 --> 00:11:33.535
Whatever you do, however you trouble him,

00:11:33.736 --> 00:11:36.544
still that person cannot be destroyed.

00:11:36.745 --> 00:11:40.224
But those who trouble them, will get destroyed themselves.

00:11:40.425 --> 00:11:43.770
When you will trust this completely,

00:11:43.971 --> 00:11:46.869
that whoever is troubling you, will get destroyed,

00:11:47.076 --> 00:11:51.483
then your heart will become totally pure and clean.

00:11:51.684 --> 00:11:54.864
This work can happen only in a pure heart,

00:11:55.065 --> 00:11:59.110
because Shri Shiva exists within us, as reflection,

00:11:59.311 --> 00:12:04.029
and only the mirror which is clean deserves to have His reflection.

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.116
Shiva Ji's anger will happen only once,

00:12:07.317 --> 00:12:10.151
or rather people say that He gets angry only once.

00:12:10.352 --> 00:12:13.196
But I have seen him getting angry many a times,

00:12:13.397 --> 00:12:15.754
because it is His right.

00:12:15.955 --> 00:12:18.203
He has a right to be angry.

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:22.131
If anyone works against Shri Adi Shakti,

00:12:22.332 --> 00:12:24.411
then Shiv Ji has very long hands.

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.881
Without listening to anyone, He finishes such a person.

00:12:28.082 --> 00:12:32.032
Because he knows that Shri Adi Shakti will not do anything Herself.

00:12:32.233 --> 00:12:35.937
She is not going to punish anyone at all,

00:12:36.138 --> 00:12:37.892
and She will forgive everyone.

00:12:38.093 --> 00:12:40.215
So, His hands are so long,

00:12:40.454 --> 00:12:42.213
then there is no limit,

00:12:42.414 --> 00:12:45.980
and when those hands start lashing, then nobody can stop them.

00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:48.023
Who dares to say anything to Him?

00:12:48.224 --> 00:12:50.420
He has got His own maryadas,

00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:54.596
which you can neither change nor go beyond.

00:12:56.267 --> 00:13:01.074
You should understand that in your individual life,

00:13:01.275 --> 00:13:06.072
in Sahaja Yoga, you have to follow Lord Shiva.

00:13:06.273 --> 00:13:10.687
Because, if you don't follow Him, firstly,

00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:24.334
You will get heart problems.

00:13:24.877 --> 00:13:28.641
First thing, is that you will get heart disease.

00:13:28.842 --> 00:13:31.105
It works out in two ways.

00:13:31.306 --> 00:13:34.970
Firstly with excessive anger the heart catches,

00:13:35.555 --> 00:13:39.781
and secondly, after the anger if a person repents,

00:13:39.982 --> 00:13:43.645
then he gets the disease called "angina".

00:13:43.846 --> 00:13:46.830
This is how both the things are useless.

00:13:47.031 --> 00:13:49.004
But one cannot quit anger, just by saying.

00:13:49.172 --> 00:13:50.997
This is something like alcohol.

00:13:51.211 --> 00:13:53.072
It becomes a habit to get angry.

00:13:53.273 --> 00:13:55.949
He starts relishing it, his face gets puffed up,

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.556
he gets extremly angry and no one can control him.

00:13:59.757 --> 00:14:02.563
So, I thought that if you sit before the mirror

00:14:02.764 --> 00:14:05.787
and get angry on yourself,

00:14:05.988 --> 00:14:08.745
rebuke yourself with few angry words

00:14:08.946 --> 00:14:11.983
and by sitting in front of the mirror if you say:

00:14:12.184 --> 00:14:14.741
"There cannot be a greater fool than me",

00:14:14.942 --> 00:14:18.511
then perhaps you may get rid of your anger.

00:14:18.712 --> 00:14:20.371
I am saying: "It might be possible",

00:14:20.572 --> 00:14:23.965
because at times, these problems are so intricate,

00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:27.188
that it is very difficult to solve them.

00:14:27.793 --> 00:14:29.773
Further, it has been observed

00:14:29.974 --> 00:14:36.639
that the more we focus our attention on something

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:43.177
and the more we react to it...

00:14:44.106 --> 00:14:47.180
Someone says something and we react instantly to it -

00:14:47.381 --> 00:14:50.579
this custom is more in the foreign countries.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.476
For example there is a carpet -

00:14:52.677 --> 00:14:56.818
immediately they will comment, “I don’t like it!", "I like it!”.

00:14:57.019 --> 00:14:59.230
Who are you to say all this?

00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:03.913
Nowadays it's a fashion to say: "I like it", "I don’t like it".

00:15:04.114 --> 00:15:08.955
As if every person is a renowned master,

00:15:09.156 --> 00:15:12.143
who goes on saying: `I like it’, `I don’t like it’.

00:15:12.344 --> 00:15:13.935
This should not be said.

00:15:14.136 --> 00:15:17.179
Saying this is the indication of your Agnya caught up.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:19.339
What do you think of yourself

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.319
that you are saying: "I like it, I don't like it"?

00:15:24.047 --> 00:15:29.389
You do not have a right to like or dislike any of the things.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:31.949
Supposing, some poor man gives you with affection,

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:34.820
some very beautiful flowers,

00:15:35.021 --> 00:15:37.977
and you say: "Sir, I don't like this flowers",

00:15:38.178 --> 00:15:43.223
you are unable to understand the hidden emotions behind this act

00:15:43.424 --> 00:15:46.592
because Shiva tattwa is absent in you.

00:15:46.793 --> 00:15:49.007
Even if it is a very small thing,

00:15:49.208 --> 00:15:51.974
which has been given to you by a poor person,

00:15:52.175 --> 00:15:58.002
you don't recognise the feeling attached to the emotion,

00:15:58.203 --> 00:16:00.850
and how lovingly he has brought that for you.

00:16:01.051 --> 00:16:05.510
For that in India the example of Sudama has been shown,

00:16:05.711 --> 00:16:10.299
that how he arrived with roasted rice to meet Shri Krishna

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:14.412
and how Shri Krishna honoured Him.

00:16:14.613 --> 00:16:17.948
Anything given with the feeling of love

00:16:18.149 --> 00:16:21.765
is like a piece of glass on which when paras (mercury) is applied

00:16:21.966 --> 00:16:25.103
it becomes a shining mirror.

00:16:25.304 --> 00:16:28.928
Similarly, if you have feelings of love for someone,

00:16:29.129 --> 00:16:31.241
a very beautiful and good feeling,

00:16:31.416 --> 00:16:33.040
but you have no money,

00:16:33.241 --> 00:16:36.540
then even if you gift that person a very small thing,

00:16:36.741 --> 00:16:38.890
then that person should think:

00:16:39.091 --> 00:16:41.328
"Aha! What an excellent thing it is".

00:16:41.529 --> 00:16:44.992
This feeling of love

00:16:45.191 --> 00:16:47.420
gives a subtle sight to the person,

00:16:47.621 --> 00:16:50.222
which can be called as artistic,

00:16:50.423 --> 00:16:52.975
artistic qualities emanates from it.

00:16:53.176 --> 00:16:54.790
When art is visible from it,

00:16:54.991 --> 00:16:57.528
you start thinking how artistic that thing is.

00:16:57.729 --> 00:17:01.495
This art is the art of love, is the art of love.

00:17:01.696 --> 00:17:04.244
By this art you can clearly see

00:17:04.445 --> 00:17:08.139
how much love is in that person,

00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:11.686
how affectionate he is, how loving he is,

00:17:11.887 --> 00:17:15.701
what a gentleman he is, what a good person he is.

00:17:15.902 --> 00:17:18.424
When you start seeing these qualities in others,

00:17:18.625 --> 00:17:20.606
then you will look within yourself,

00:17:20.812 --> 00:17:24.548
and will start thinking: "How am I?”

00:17:24.749 --> 00:17:26.788
“Do I have that much love?”,

00:17:26.989 --> 00:17:28.870
“Do I have this gentleman's qualities"?

00:17:29.071 --> 00:17:30.892
"Do I have all this goodness within me,

00:17:31.093 --> 00:17:34.516
or am I rendering lip service only?

00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:38.422
And thus misleading the people".

00:17:38.623 --> 00:17:41.548
Actually we are misleading ourselves only.

00:17:41.749 --> 00:17:45.165
When we are doing wrong things, living a wrong lifestyle,

00:17:45.366 --> 00:17:47.931
when our lives are completely filled

00:17:48.114 --> 00:17:50.343
with wrong conceptions,

00:17:50.544 --> 00:17:52.807
then we cannot make anyone happy

00:17:53.008 --> 00:17:55.345
and definitely we cannot be happy as well.

00:17:55.546 --> 00:17:57.579
So from the point of view of “swartha”,

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.909
"swartha" - this word is very beautiful -

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:02.201
it means "to know thy Self" (swa ka arth).

00:18:02.402 --> 00:18:06.099
"Swa" means the Spirit - you must know the meaning of it.

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.655
To know the meaning of it people worship Shri Shiva.

00:18:09.856 --> 00:18:14.990
But I have seen that the worshipers of Shiva are very hot tempered,

00:18:15.591 --> 00:18:20.603
full of anger, very miserly and what not.

00:18:20.804 --> 00:18:23.196
No one is as generous as Shri Shiva,

00:18:23.397 --> 00:18:26.243
no one is as loving as Shri Shiva.

00:18:26.418 --> 00:18:28.650
He is the source of love;

00:18:28.851 --> 00:18:32.818
the love which is flowing all around is the leela of His Holy feet.

00:18:33.019 --> 00:18:35.871
It is due to Him this work is happening,

00:18:36.072 --> 00:18:40.258
that people are fully immersed in the ocean of love in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:40.459 --> 00:18:42.670
After coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:42.871 --> 00:18:46.493
when you attain the state,

00:18:47.143 --> 00:18:49.864
the state which should be called as Jiva Atma,

00:18:50.065 --> 00:18:54.411
then your attention,

00:18:54.612 --> 00:18:59.668
your attention gets engrossed in the Lotus Feet of Shiv Ji.

00:18:59.869 --> 00:19:03.685
And as soon as it gets engrossed in Shri Shiva's Lotus Feet,

00:19:03.886 --> 00:19:06.972
what happens within you,

00:19:07.173 --> 00:19:12.272
is that whatever qualities of the five elements are there,

00:19:12.473 --> 00:19:15.079
they also become very subtle.

00:19:15.484 --> 00:19:19.115
I have already told you about the four elements,

00:19:19.316 --> 00:19:22.742
but the fifth one, which is called ‘ether’ in English,

00:19:22.943 --> 00:19:24.343
I didn’t tell you about.

00:19:24.544 --> 00:19:26.127
Here it is called "akash".

00:19:26.328 --> 00:19:32.114
Akash tattwa is that, when a seeker attains the subtle state,

00:19:32.315 --> 00:19:36.067
then he attains the subtlety of the ether element.

00:19:36.268 --> 00:19:38.971
That ”akash” which drives the ether,

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.733
that akash which...

00:19:45.226 --> 00:19:47.823
is self-driven.

00:19:48.024 --> 00:19:53.243
If a person has any problem or any trouble,

00:19:53.466 --> 00:19:59.275
then through this omnipresent akash tattwa,

00:19:59.476 --> 00:20:02.467
which is everywhere,

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:08.086
instantly the effect of your attention reaches where it is required.

00:20:08.287 --> 00:20:11.980
It is an amazing thing, but it happens and it happened also.

00:20:12.181 --> 00:20:15.862
People may call it miracle, but it is not.

00:20:16.063 --> 00:20:20.231
In Sahaja Yoga if your Shiva tatwa is awakened,

00:20:20.432 --> 00:20:23.271
then all the subtle,

00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:30.854
the subtlest of the subtle emotions and state

00:20:31.055 --> 00:20:32.817
get awakened within you.

00:20:33.018 --> 00:20:37.443
Therefore it is necessary for us to purify our heart first.

00:20:37.644 --> 00:20:42.310
Previously I have talked to you about three enemies.

00:20:42.511 --> 00:20:46.897
Now, the fourth enemy present within us is "madha".

00:20:47.098 --> 00:20:49.367
"Madha" means ego.

00:20:51.583 --> 00:20:54.410
When this ego affects the women,

00:20:54.611 --> 00:20:58.058
they start walking like men.

00:20:58.259 --> 00:21:01.130
Then they cannot walk like women because of the pride -

00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:03.709
"I am something very special" kind of feeling.

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:10.565
Supposing a girl either comes from a very rich family,

00:21:10.766 --> 00:21:12.342
or she is very beautiful,

00:21:12.543 --> 00:21:15.265
or very well educated, whatever is the reason,

00:21:15.466 --> 00:21:18.709
if she gets ego by anything,

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:23.483
then she starts walking like a man.

00:21:24.252 --> 00:21:27.245
And when a man is affected by ego,

00:21:27.459 --> 00:21:30.307
he starts walking like a woman.

00:21:30.517 --> 00:21:33.083
Meaning such a man makes himself up,

00:21:33.284 --> 00:21:38.170
for hours sits before the mirror, combs his hair, does this, that

00:21:38.371 --> 00:21:41.223
does all kinds of feminine actions.

00:21:41.893 --> 00:21:43.775
To dress up is the job of the women.

00:21:43.976 --> 00:21:45.801
While walking also he doesn't walk straight,

00:21:46.002 --> 00:21:47.945
he walks in a peculiar style.

00:21:48.146 --> 00:21:49.470
From behind, if you see him,

00:21:49.671 --> 00:21:53.549
you will feel as if a lady is walking in a male dress.

00:21:55.185 --> 00:21:58.418
So, when a man

00:21:58.601 --> 00:22:03.707
gets intoxicated with this ego (madha),

00:22:03.908 --> 00:22:06.210
then he is completely lost in his own world.

00:22:06.411 --> 00:22:10.715
In his ego, he starts swaying like an elephant.

00:22:10.942 --> 00:22:13.377
All his actions become different.

00:22:13.578 --> 00:22:18.155
Whether they talk or don't talk, the way they sit -

00:22:18.356 --> 00:22:21.110
in every action it is evident

00:22:21.311 --> 00:22:23.904
that they have some kind of ego within them.

00:22:24.105 --> 00:22:27.592
It is difficult to understand the cause of their ego,

00:22:27.793 --> 00:22:30.219
what makes them think that they are special.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.385
All these things are petty things.

00:22:33.586 --> 00:22:35.558
They have no meaning at all.

00:22:35.759 --> 00:22:38.781
In Sahaja Yoga they have no meaning at all.

00:22:38.982 --> 00:22:41.285
And so that is why

00:22:41.486 --> 00:22:43.913
to believe in these kind of things,

00:22:44.114 --> 00:22:46.133
that "we are something special",

00:22:46.334 --> 00:22:48.713
then you just end up to be worse than ordinary.

00:22:48.914 --> 00:22:51.625
You do not remain extraordinary, you become worse than ordinary.

00:22:51.832 --> 00:22:56.248
It means that it's not wise to have any imagination about yourself,

00:22:56.449 --> 00:22:59.265
that "I am very rich" or "I am something great".

00:22:59.466 --> 00:23:02.568
Now even the poor people suffer from ego.

00:23:02.769 --> 00:23:06.093
Even the dalits have become egoistical, it's beyond understanding.

00:23:06.294 --> 00:23:10.299
People talk as if they are something very great.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.743
What are you as an individual?

00:23:12.944 --> 00:23:16.037
A devotee of God Almighty.

00:23:16.986 --> 00:23:20.835
You are Sahaja Yogis, who believe in God.

00:23:21.753 --> 00:23:25.190
To think about yourself that you are something great,

00:23:25.391 --> 00:23:27.571
is to go away from the state of joy (anand),

00:23:27.772 --> 00:23:31.624
because the power of Shiva gives the state of joy to the seeker.

00:23:31.825 --> 00:23:35.539
To get absorbed in the state of joy,

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.338
people worship Lord Shiva.

00:23:37.539 --> 00:23:40.276
But I have seen that most of the Shiva bhaktas

00:23:40.477 --> 00:23:42.047
are quite grumpy people -

00:23:42.248 --> 00:23:43.924
no one can talk to them.

00:23:44.125 --> 00:23:45.376
What is the use?

00:23:45.577 --> 00:23:48.286
They worship Shri Shiva who is verily Natraj,

00:23:48.487 --> 00:23:52.103
from whom emanate all forms of art,

00:23:52.304 --> 00:23:54.306
who is extremely joyful,

00:23:54.489 --> 00:23:56.963
who is the embodiment of "anand".

00:23:57.164 --> 00:24:01.022
In front of Him, how could these people be called His bhaktas?

00:24:01.223 --> 00:24:03.673
They hang such a big linga around their neck,

00:24:03.874 --> 00:24:05.590
which could give them a heart attack.

00:24:05.791 --> 00:24:07.097
What is the need for that?

00:24:07.298 --> 00:24:09.665
You can yourself become the "linga swarupa".

00:24:09.866 --> 00:24:11.492
Without becoming that,

00:24:11.693 --> 00:24:16.174
they claim: "We are Shiva bhaktas",

00:24:16.375 --> 00:24:18.679
and start fighting after worshipping Shri Shiva.

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.128
And they have different marks.

00:24:21.329 --> 00:24:24.463
Shiva bhaktas will put mark across the forehead,

00:24:24.672 --> 00:24:28.073
and Vishnu bhaktas will put the mark along the forehead.

00:24:28.274 --> 00:24:31.454
Oh! What does this mean?

00:24:31.655 --> 00:24:34.898
Vertical application means that you are ascending - alright!

00:24:35.099 --> 00:24:37.390
You are ascending

00:24:37.591 --> 00:24:40.921
and once you reach that state you should become peaceful.

00:24:41.122 --> 00:24:44.556
The mark should be applied both ways, or not be applied at all.

00:24:44.757 --> 00:24:46.795
It should have some meaning,

00:24:46.996 --> 00:24:49.567
that those who are trying to achieve Shri Shiva,

00:24:49.768 --> 00:24:51.985
should go through the central path ("Sopan marg").

00:24:52.186 --> 00:24:53.877
While passing through this path,

00:24:54.078 --> 00:24:57.610
you have to leave behind all the negativities.

00:24:58.629 --> 00:25:03.474
Before criticizing others, learn to criticize yourself.

00:25:04.142 --> 00:25:07.955
Say it to yourself: "I am like this, I am like that".

00:25:08.156 --> 00:25:09.860
When you start critisizing yourself,

00:25:10.061 --> 00:25:13.073
then you will see that all the bhoots will run away.

00:25:13.274 --> 00:25:15.975
Because we have gathered all these negativities,

00:25:16.176 --> 00:25:19.232
by our continuous thought process, by our Agnya.

00:25:19.438 --> 00:25:21.324
By the excessive use of Agnya,

00:25:21.525 --> 00:25:23.137
we start accumulating negative forces,

00:25:23.338 --> 00:25:25.320
everything transforms into a mental projection

00:25:25.521 --> 00:25:29.393
and such a person becomes troublesome and creates misery.

00:25:29.594 --> 00:25:33.203
And that misery makes him also miserable.

00:25:33.404 --> 00:25:36.414
By giving unhappiness to others, you can never be happy.

00:25:36.615 --> 00:25:39.320
It will have its impact on you even if you are a stone.

00:25:39.521 --> 00:25:41.613
It will have its impact

00:25:41.814 --> 00:25:46.154
and the impact is such that the person becomes unhappy.

00:25:48.067 --> 00:25:50.375
As far as a Mother is concerned,

00:25:50.576 --> 00:25:53.583
She always thinks of your welfare.

00:25:54.282 --> 00:25:56.304
She thinks what makes you happy,

00:25:56.505 --> 00:25:58.445
what gives you contentment,

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.751
what gives you peace of mind.

00:26:00.952 --> 00:26:02.793
what can give you love

00:26:02.994 --> 00:26:06.340
and what makes you become a saintly person in this world.

00:26:06.541 --> 00:26:08.413
This is the method of the Mother,

00:26:08.614 --> 00:26:10.818
but this is not Shri Shiva's method.

00:26:11.019 --> 00:26:14.249
He tolerates upto a certain limit and then deals so severely

00:26:14.459 --> 00:26:19.018
that I get terrified that what is going to happen to that person.

00:26:19.219 --> 00:26:21.768
Where shall he reach? What is he going to do?

00:26:21.969 --> 00:26:23.796
Shri Shiva doesn't think that.

00:26:23.997 --> 00:26:27.393
It is not in His nature to think that:

00:26:27.623 --> 00:26:33.212
"Even if he is very bad and evil, I will forgive him!".

00:26:33.413 --> 00:26:37.146
Yes, if the person is worthy of His forgiveness, then He forgives.

00:26:37.347 --> 00:26:40.275
And those who meditate upon Him and do lot of penance,

00:26:40.476 --> 00:26:43.003
He blesses them with boons.

00:26:43.204 --> 00:26:50.984
But that person who, basically, does not want to correct himself,

00:26:51.185 --> 00:26:52.578
Lord Shiva sets him right.

00:26:52.779 --> 00:26:53.979
It is a fact.

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:57.473
That’s why we should be scared of Him as He is called ”Bhayankar” (Terrifying).

00:26:57.674 --> 00:27:01.404
When He gets angry then He does not forgive anyone.

00:27:01.605 --> 00:27:06.588
But His worst anger comes during the doomsday,

00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:11.039
what we call: "the night when the whole creation will be finished".

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.855
At that time, He will destroy everything with his anger.

00:27:15.056 --> 00:27:21.279
That time, as I have told you, is the Last Judgement.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.372
During this time which path you take to, where you go,

00:27:25.573 --> 00:27:27.147
whatever you do,

00:27:27.348 --> 00:27:32.944
all these things are completely stored within you.

00:27:34.277 --> 00:27:37.131
Every small detail about you is recorded

00:27:37.332 --> 00:27:42.889
and accordingly you are sent either to Heaven or to Hell.

00:27:43.090 --> 00:27:46.887
It is Lord Shiva who sends people to Hell, not Me.

00:27:47.088 --> 00:27:49.084
I have nothing to do with the Hell (Naraka).

00:27:49.285 --> 00:27:50.988
But Lord Shiva has.

00:27:51.189 --> 00:27:54.039
He will pull you by your legs and throw you in the Hell.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.637
Then you cannot say that "I am the worshipper of the Mother,

00:27:58.847 --> 00:28:04.388
and I am the follower of Mother, then why is this happening to me?".

00:28:04.589 --> 00:28:06.739
I am not instrumental in that.

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:11.515
Once someone calls Me Mother, then I can not think ill of him.

00:28:11.716 --> 00:28:15.292
But, If I am the maryada for Shri Shiva

00:28:15.493 --> 00:28:17.371
then He is my maryada (limit) too.

00:28:17.572 --> 00:28:22.258
But, in this regard since we both are totally opposite in nature,

00:28:22.459 --> 00:28:25.461
you have to be very careful.

00:28:26.367 --> 00:28:29.235
And the eleven Rudras present in Christ

00:28:29.436 --> 00:28:31.129
are also the manifestation of Shri Shiva.

00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:34.661
The emotions of the Rudras are the form of Lord Shiva,

00:28:34.862 --> 00:28:39.196
that is why, you have to be very careful.

00:28:40.249 --> 00:28:43.555
Regarding this I have to warn you,

00:28:43.756 --> 00:28:47.939
because even in Sahaja Yoga some people come to earn money,

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.887
some talk ill of others, some do wrong things,

00:28:51.088 --> 00:28:53.017
some do injustice.

00:28:53.218 --> 00:28:56.051
Such persons are sieved out of the stream.

00:28:56.252 --> 00:28:59.798
But as soon as they are out, they get into the orbit of Lord Shiva.

00:28:59.999 --> 00:29:02.797
Then I get the news that they have gone bankrupt,

00:29:02.998 --> 00:29:06.478
this happened, that happened. I say: "Now don't tell Me this".

00:29:06.679 --> 00:29:08.983
They themselves came out of His protection,

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:11.805
then who could save them?

00:29:12.006 --> 00:29:17.965
So, you should try to seek your protection in Lord Shiva.

00:29:18.166 --> 00:29:20.095
Of course, you are protected by Mother,

00:29:20.296 --> 00:29:22.477
but you should seek also Lord Shiva's protection.

00:29:22.678 --> 00:29:26.876
For that, I told you about the five elements.

00:29:27.077 --> 00:29:32.178
The subtelty of these five elements should be attained by you.

00:29:32.379 --> 00:29:39.116
And to achieve that state you should meditate regularly.

00:29:39.924 --> 00:29:42.794
Those who meditate, look totally different

00:29:42.995 --> 00:29:46.526
and those who do not meditate also look different in another way,

00:29:46.727 --> 00:29:48.335
no doubt about it.

00:29:48.536 --> 00:29:51.678
Now those who meditate but they are not willing to do it,

00:29:51.879 --> 00:29:53.715
whose attention is not there in meditation,

00:29:53.916 --> 00:29:57.164
those who do not have understanding or discretion for meditation,

00:29:57.365 --> 00:30:00.852
and they have a kind of laziness towards it,

00:30:01.053 --> 00:30:05.057
then that meditation is not fruitful,

00:30:05.258 --> 00:30:07.164
one does not get any benefit from it.

00:30:07.365 --> 00:30:09.972
Meditation should be such

00:30:10.147 --> 00:30:15.272
that each and every cell of your body gets filled with joy

00:30:15.473 --> 00:30:17.561
and bliss showers over you.

00:30:17.762 --> 00:30:26.035
Lord Shiva's first and most important blessing

00:30:26.236 --> 00:30:30.675
is that He gives you joy, He fills your being with happiness.

00:30:31.474 --> 00:30:35.355
Even only by chanting His name,

00:30:35.556 --> 00:30:38.805
a person should become joyous.

00:30:39.006 --> 00:30:43.377
But instead people always behave in an opposite way.

00:30:43.578 --> 00:30:48.106
I feel surprised that nothing is as expected,

00:30:48.307 --> 00:30:51.064
that the people whom we think to be Shiva bhaktas (devotees),

00:30:51.265 --> 00:30:55.862
how could they be such dry personalities?

00:30:56.077 --> 00:30:57.963
Not possible at all.

00:30:58.164 --> 00:31:00.400
There is one more reason for it.

00:31:00.601 --> 00:31:05.923
Those who are always busy working, too busy,

00:31:06.124 --> 00:31:08.424
they become right sided.

00:31:08.625 --> 00:31:10.695
When they become too much right sided,

00:31:10.896 --> 00:31:13.604
they get devoid of Lord Shiva.

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:15.714
They move away from Lord Shiva;

00:31:15.915 --> 00:31:19.734
and then Shri Shiva shows His power.

00:31:19.935 --> 00:31:23.328
Now you know that Shri Saraswati is the sister of Lord Shiva.

00:31:23.529 --> 00:31:25.527
The worshippers of Shri Saraswati,

00:31:25.728 --> 00:31:31.030
I mean the people who read and write, who gather knowledge,

00:31:31.274 --> 00:31:37.478
and apart from that, who are interested in art,

00:31:37.679 --> 00:31:39.573
who are genuine art lovers,

00:31:39.774 --> 00:31:44.359
this kind of people who worship Shri Saraswati, pay homage to Her,

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:48.973
they should know first of all that She is Shri Shiva's sister

00:31:49.174 --> 00:31:52.885
and you know that sister's relationship is very powerful.

00:31:53.086 --> 00:31:57.755
If you try to deceit His sister,

00:31:57.956 --> 00:32:01.846
adopt any bad qualities or talk ill of Her -

00:32:02.047 --> 00:32:05.338
for example, many people write impure literature or bad books,

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:09.750
many people have knowledge, but they distort it -

00:32:09.951 --> 00:32:14.111
this kind of people cannot escape the wrath of Shri Shiva.

00:32:14.312 --> 00:32:17.851
Because His sister is very important.

00:32:18.052 --> 00:32:22.103
And to deceive Her is the greatest sin.

00:32:22.304 --> 00:32:24.860
In His view, it is a very big sin.

00:32:25.061 --> 00:32:31.597
And regarding Shri Adi Shakti His protocols are equally rigid,

00:32:31.798 --> 00:32:33.534
there is no doubt about that.

00:32:33.735 --> 00:32:37.979
Please check this mike. It is falling off.

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:42.273
And now, Sahaja Yogis,

00:32:42.488 --> 00:32:46.565
first of all have to pay attention towards themselves.

00:32:46.766 --> 00:32:49.633
I do not mean that they should sit before the mirror for hours.

00:32:49.834 --> 00:32:51.026
Not at all.

00:32:51.227 --> 00:32:54.984
Sitting before the mirror all the time, is also considered a disease.

00:32:55.185 --> 00:32:59.390
I mean to say that you should have attention towards your Self,

00:32:59.591 --> 00:33:05.160
look at yourself and see: "What are the problems within me"?

00:33:05.361 --> 00:33:08.294
“What wrong things am I doing?”.

00:33:08.495 --> 00:33:11.441
In our Indian culture,

00:33:11.642 --> 00:33:15.553
the straight path, which has been suggested, should be taken.

00:33:15.754 --> 00:33:17.980
In this time a new era has come,

00:33:18.181 --> 00:33:22.663
in which people think they can live as they want, but it is not so.

00:33:22.864 --> 00:33:24.740
Being in India,

00:33:24.941 --> 00:33:28.968
you have to be in total harmony with the Indian culture.

00:33:29.169 --> 00:33:34.268
Your life style should remain connected to lndian culture,

00:33:34.469 --> 00:33:38.853
because in our culture, Shiva tattwa is given great importance.

00:33:39.054 --> 00:33:41.573
Most important of all is Shiva tattwa.

00:33:41.774 --> 00:33:46.091
And Shiva tattwa only has created our "maryadas".

00:33:46.292 --> 00:33:50.868
The moment you cross these maryadas, you are finished.

00:33:51.069 --> 00:33:54.122
All these maryadas which are in our culture

00:33:54.323 --> 00:33:57.306
are because of the grace of Lord Shiva.

00:33:57.507 --> 00:34:02.901
Whatever has been told to us so far: "Don't do this, don't do that",

00:34:03.102 --> 00:34:05.045
everything big and small,

00:34:05.246 --> 00:34:08.105
these maryadas (boundaries) have been laid by Lord Shiva.

00:34:08.306 --> 00:34:12.304
He is so much concerned about His maryadas

00:34:12.505 --> 00:34:16.812
that the moment you step over these boundaries,

00:34:17.013 --> 00:34:19.944
you get affected.

00:34:20.413 --> 00:34:22.075
Now, in the name of Shiva tattwa,

00:34:22.276 --> 00:34:25.533
people have created so many wrong ideas.

00:34:25.734 --> 00:34:29.088
Like many people think that taking "bhaang" (an intoxicating drink)

00:34:29.289 --> 00:34:31.689
can awaken Shiva tattwa.

00:34:31.863 --> 00:34:34.681
Many others who consume liquor think

00:34:34.882 --> 00:34:38.003
that drinking alcohol submerges you in Shiva tattwa!

00:34:38.204 --> 00:34:42.013
Many wrong ideas of this type have been created by people,

00:34:42.214 --> 00:34:44.949
that this kind of acts are all right for Shri Shiva,

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:47.565
because He has done that.

00:34:47.766 --> 00:34:50.668
Shri Shiva drank poison also.

00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:53.223
Would you also drink poison?

00:34:53.424 --> 00:34:59.398
He drank poison to make the whole world free from it.

00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:03.305
That is why He used to eat "dhatura" (jimsonweed),

00:35:03.506 --> 00:35:06.408
because "dhatura" contains poison.

00:35:06.801 --> 00:35:09.460
Similarly you might have heard

00:35:09.661 --> 00:35:14.249
that Sai Nath used plenty of tobacco.

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:18.359
He used to fill it in a pipe and inhale the smoke.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.864
The reason was that most people in Maharashtra are tobacco addicts.

00:35:23.065 --> 00:35:25.007
A minister also will consume tobacco

00:35:25.208 --> 00:35:27.546
and his servant will also consume it.

00:35:27.747 --> 00:35:32.853
And the minister will ask a servant: "Give me tobacco if you have".

00:35:33.054 --> 00:35:37.607
To this great extent there people are used to tobacco

00:35:37.808 --> 00:35:40.760
although tobacco is not grown here, in Maharashtra.

00:35:40.961 --> 00:35:44.136
But somehow they are crazy for tobacco.

00:35:44.337 --> 00:35:47.046
To such great extent people consume tobacco in Maharashtra.

00:35:47.247 --> 00:35:51.303
To free people of this addiction Sainath thought:

00:35:51.504 --> 00:35:54.941
"Why don't I consume all the tobacco?".

00:35:55.142 --> 00:35:58.249
That is why He used to inhale tobacco.

00:35:58.450 --> 00:36:02.063
But people started saying: "Sainath is smoking, so we also can do".

00:36:02.233 --> 00:36:06.614
Because of these kind of people, He used to consume tobacco

00:36:06.821 --> 00:36:11.538
so that the tobacco addiction of these people will come to an end.

00:36:11.739 --> 00:36:15.941
Now, whatever you call it, tobacco is tobacco,

00:36:16.142 --> 00:36:19.970
and there is no connection between Lord Shiva and tobacco

00:36:20.171 --> 00:36:27.581
but definitely He wanted to destroy it from the whole world.

00:36:27.782 --> 00:36:30.114
Now supposing we take the example of Goddess

00:36:30.315 --> 00:36:34.848
and the job of the Goddess is to eat all the bhoots,

00:36:35.049 --> 00:36:37.640
so would you also eat bhoots?

00:36:38.245 --> 00:36:40.411
Also the job of the Goddess is

00:36:40.612 --> 00:36:48.008
to absorb whatever diseases you have.

00:36:49.588 --> 00:36:51.805
So, would you dare to do that?

00:36:52.006 --> 00:36:54.498
This is not your job.

00:36:54.699 --> 00:36:59.120
Similarly, whatever the saints and sages have done,

00:36:59.321 --> 00:37:02.894
you neither have the power to do it right now,

00:37:03.085 --> 00:37:04.954
nor it is your job.

00:37:05.155 --> 00:37:08.049
Your job is to cleanse yourself,

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:12.235
to correct yourself and first attain that state.

00:37:12.436 --> 00:37:14.510
Then all the other matters will be alright.

00:37:14.711 --> 00:37:18.360
But if you don't reach that state, it is useless.

00:37:18.561 --> 00:37:22.072
For you, doing all these rituals is a waste.

00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:24.045
There are many things,

00:37:24.246 --> 00:37:30.529
which can be justified wrongly.

00:37:30.926 --> 00:37:35.226
But if we have to go in the right direction, walk on the right path,

00:37:35.427 --> 00:37:39.344
then first of all we have to purify our hearts.

00:37:39.545 --> 00:37:42.496
All these habits that we are addicted to,

00:37:42.898 --> 00:37:46.246
these habits also altogether

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:49.714
affect our heart.

00:37:49.915 --> 00:37:52.626
So in the olden times, it so happened,

00:37:52.827 --> 00:37:58.240
that all the disciples who came, were made to sleep in jungles.

00:38:06.781 --> 00:38:11.058
They used to live in jungles among the snakes, scorpions

00:38:11.259 --> 00:38:14.697
spiders and all other animals,

00:38:15.774 --> 00:38:19.892
so that they do not get addicted to a luxurious life.

00:38:20.591 --> 00:38:23.077
At the most they could sleep in huts,

00:38:23.278 --> 00:38:27.320
which were covered with cow dung.

00:38:27.521 --> 00:38:32.089
They used to live a very simple life and wear minimal clothes,

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:36.688
so that children do not become crazy about clothes.

00:38:37.774 --> 00:38:42.992
"We want to wear these cloths, those shoes, we want this food" -

00:38:43.193 --> 00:38:45.660
Sahaja Yogis should not say all this.

00:38:45.861 --> 00:38:48.383
You know that your Mother can live anywhere,

00:38:48.584 --> 00:38:51.000
can sleep anywhere, can eat any food.

00:38:51.201 --> 00:38:54.434
So Indians have a craze for taste within -

00:38:54.635 --> 00:39:00.674
all the people here are very fond of eating.

00:39:00.875 --> 00:39:05.391
Sahaja Yogis also invite each other for having food together.

00:39:06.398 --> 00:39:10.027
Ladies particularly have to say, wherever I go,

00:39:10.228 --> 00:39:12.292
"Mother, come to our house to have some food".

00:39:12.495 --> 00:39:14.872
My food habits are very different.

00:39:15.073 --> 00:39:18.849
I cannot eat in a hotel, I cannot eat anywhere.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:23.700
Even in my own house I eat without salt and sugar.

00:39:23.901 --> 00:39:27.146
I am not bothered about taste since childhood.

00:39:27.347 --> 00:39:29.378
I eat whatever is available.

00:39:29.579 --> 00:39:34.028
But Indian tongues are very fond of spicy and tangy tastes.

00:39:34.229 --> 00:39:40.449
Whether they are from from U.P., from Punjab or from South,

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:45.442
in the matter of eating, Indians are great experts.

00:39:45.643 --> 00:39:50.016
And women befool the men by serving them good food.

00:39:51.297 --> 00:39:56.914
"My husband is fond of this food, my husband is fond of that food"

00:39:57.115 --> 00:39:58.333
What to do?

00:39:58.534 --> 00:40:01.767
Women will be slaves to their husbands and try to please them.

00:40:01.968 --> 00:40:04.633
If they keep talking about food day and night,

00:40:04.834 --> 00:40:07.221
then they are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:40:07.916 --> 00:40:11.473
And when I was there in Milan,

00:40:11.674 --> 00:40:14.800
during the program of Guru puja,

00:40:15.001 --> 00:40:17.123
I Myself cooked the food. What to do?

00:40:17.324 --> 00:40:19.770
For four years I Myself cooked there,

00:40:19.971 --> 00:40:22.566
because no one else prepared tasty food.

00:40:22.767 --> 00:40:25.360
People would say: "Mother, it tastes just like plastic".

00:40:25.561 --> 00:40:27.780
In particular, the Indians.

00:40:27.981 --> 00:40:31.232
All the Indians who come there for Puja, have to meet Me,

00:40:31.433 --> 00:40:33.335
as if they have special right over Me.

00:40:33.536 --> 00:40:35.971
Also they are very critical about the food,

00:40:36.172 --> 00:40:37.870
that the food served here is not good.

00:40:38.053 --> 00:40:41.402
Now one more new thing has begun among Indians,

00:40:41.603 --> 00:40:44.674
that they want attached bathrooms.

00:40:45.962 --> 00:40:49.426
Their bathrooms, if you go to their houses and see,

00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:51.408
how their parents lived there...

00:40:51.609 --> 00:40:55.522
Now, they want attached bathroom, that too western style.

00:40:55.723 --> 00:40:59.539
I am mentioning this today, because I am tired of it.

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:05.353
In Ganapatipule, I provided western bathrooms separately for them.

00:41:05.797 --> 00:41:07.892
At first I provided Indian toilets,

00:41:08.093 --> 00:41:11.208
thinking that Indians will like Indian style.

00:41:11.409 --> 00:41:14.053
And I provided foreign people with western style.

00:41:14.254 --> 00:41:16.935
But then Indians said: "We also need western bathrooms".

00:41:17.136 --> 00:41:18.518
Now what is this?

00:41:18.719 --> 00:41:21.620
I said: "Now a strike is going to start here".

00:41:21.821 --> 00:41:26.594
I said: "Take tumblers and go to jungle, that is what you deserve".

00:41:27.104 --> 00:41:29.791
For years together they have been going like this,

00:41:29.992 --> 00:41:35.106
but now they have become great sahabs and want attached bathrooms.

00:41:35.313 --> 00:41:40.122
Poor western people, poor foreigners who came from abroad said:

00:41:40.323 --> 00:41:44.150
"Mother, we prefer Indian style, because they are very clean.

00:41:44.351 --> 00:41:46.023
So give us Indian bathrooms only".

00:41:46.224 --> 00:41:47.827
Then I changed the arrangement

00:41:48.028 --> 00:41:52.467
and Indians were very happy that they got attached bathrooms.

00:41:52.668 --> 00:41:54.984
You should be ashamed of it.

00:41:55.185 --> 00:41:58.410
Sahaja Yogis should be ashamed talking about such things.

00:41:58.611 --> 00:42:00.790
Your forefathers used to go to jungle with tumblers

00:42:00.991 --> 00:42:02.623
so why do you have this new craze?

00:42:02.824 --> 00:42:06.253
Do you have some disease or any other problem?

00:42:06.454 --> 00:42:08.317
They put Me in great trouble.

00:42:08.518 --> 00:42:10.747
But somehow it struck Me that:

00:42:10.948 --> 00:42:14.421
"Okay, you take this and you take that".

00:42:16.832 --> 00:42:19.492
This kind of giving excuses and doing such things,

00:42:19.693 --> 00:42:21.813
is something only Indians do.

00:42:22.014 --> 00:42:25.483
You will be surprised, people who come to Cabella,

00:42:25.684 --> 00:42:27.851
all of them stay with one another,

00:42:28.052 --> 00:42:31.110
though they are very rich people, they have cars and everything,

00:42:31.311 --> 00:42:33.086
still they would sleep in the pendal.

00:42:33.287 --> 00:42:36.915
But Indians will have a special place for themselves,

00:42:37.116 --> 00:42:39.563
they will stay in hotels and roam around in cars.

00:42:39.764 --> 00:42:42.257
They do not have, even to a small extent,

00:42:42.458 --> 00:42:45.542
any kind of sacrificing attitude.

00:42:46.831 --> 00:42:49.125
They have not learnt how to sacrifice.

00:42:49.332 --> 00:42:54.019
The way we became so modern nowadays, it's beyond My understanding.

00:42:54.427 --> 00:42:58.077
Now, there are no servants in foreigners' houses.

00:42:58.278 --> 00:42:59.935
So, they have no attached bath,

00:43:00.136 --> 00:43:03.157
they have only one bathroom, because they only have to clean it.

00:43:03.358 --> 00:43:07.694
You all have servants, so you can afford even ten bathrooms.

00:43:08.144 --> 00:43:13.926
But all these things are taking you away from your own powers.

00:43:14.127 --> 00:43:16.958
Your attention is going in useless things.

00:43:17.159 --> 00:43:19.847
Frittering away of the attention in absurdities,

00:43:20.048 --> 00:43:26.320
all this will make you a very ordinary human being.

00:43:27.159 --> 00:43:30.810
Among women, it is fashion nowadays to go to beauty parlours.

00:43:31.011 --> 00:43:32.747
Their face remains the same.

00:43:32.948 --> 00:43:36.107
They will spend money there, do this here and do that there.

00:43:36.308 --> 00:43:39.074
In Pune, the wife of brahmins

00:43:39.275 --> 00:43:43.038
will wear sleeveless dresses, use goggles

00:43:43.239 --> 00:43:45.845
and roam around in a moped.

00:43:46.046 --> 00:43:48.076
I don't understand it.

00:43:49.382 --> 00:43:51.763
In Pune, which is punya-pattanam (land of good deeds).

00:43:51.964 --> 00:43:54.780
Is this the way to do good deeds?

00:43:55.276 --> 00:43:58.398
We are adopting to western style in such a way,

00:43:58.599 --> 00:44:02.821
without thinking where is Shiva tattwa in this?

00:44:04.088 --> 00:44:06.141
Look at Shri Shiva,

00:44:06.342 --> 00:44:08.276
He sits comfortably with minimal clothes.

00:44:08.477 --> 00:44:11.801
In His marriage procession also He sat upon Nandi and went.

00:44:12.002 --> 00:44:15.763
Why Nandi? Because Nandi is His disciple.

00:44:15.964 --> 00:44:18.590
Whatever He says, Nandi will nod his head.

00:44:18.791 --> 00:44:23.624
He can tell Nandi anything, that's why he is His dearest disciple.

00:44:23.802 --> 00:44:28.288
Now, He sat upon Nandi and arrived at His wedding venue.

00:44:28.945 --> 00:44:31.153
So, Parvati Ji had no objection,

00:44:31.354 --> 00:44:33.659
but Her brother, Shri Vishnu got a little worried:

00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:37.501
"Why is the bridegroom coming in this manner?".

00:44:37.702 --> 00:44:41.335
I do not mean that you become this kind of a groom,

00:44:41.536 --> 00:44:46.611
I don't mean that, but still, to overdo things

00:44:46.812 --> 00:44:51.470
and spending unnecessarily is of no use.

00:44:51.671 --> 00:44:53.546
Be sensible.

00:44:53.747 --> 00:44:56.963
Wisdom is your ornament.

00:44:57.164 --> 00:45:00.617
To accept everything, whatever is there, is alright.

00:45:00.818 --> 00:45:02.117
Food - alright.

00:45:02.318 --> 00:45:04.511
Now, if they go to someone's house for food,

00:45:04.712 --> 00:45:07.147
they will keep critisizing the host.

00:45:07.348 --> 00:45:09.533
May not be in front of them but back home they'll say:

00:45:09.734 --> 00:45:11.287
"What kind of food was that?".

00:45:11.488 --> 00:45:16.144
If the host cooked good, then they demand same food in their house.

00:45:17.073 --> 00:45:20.634
The whole day attention is on taste of the tongue -

00:45:20.835 --> 00:45:24.711
it is too much in India, beyond the limit.

00:45:25.258 --> 00:45:27.401
This kind attention should be reduced.

00:45:27.602 --> 00:45:32.621
The foreign yogis eat Indian food. I've never heard any complaint.

00:45:32.822 --> 00:45:37.402
Although, you can never eat their western food.

00:45:42.159 --> 00:45:46.973
But the way you have coated yourself with these things,

00:45:47.174 --> 00:45:50.579
will not let you get into the deeper joy.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:56.041
To achieve the joy of Lord Shiva,

00:45:56.242 --> 00:45:59.406
it is said that you have to renounce everything.

00:45:59.607 --> 00:46:01.208
First renounce the world,

00:46:01.409 --> 00:46:04.026
go to Himalayas and stand on one leg.

00:46:04.227 --> 00:46:06.846
Wear minimal clothes.

00:46:07.047 --> 00:46:11.419
Take a dip in the river and then meditate in wet clothes.

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:13.774
They used to torture the body in every possible way.

00:46:13.975 --> 00:46:16.584
Even these days gurus beat their disciples.

00:46:16.785 --> 00:46:18.200
They trouble them a lot.

00:46:18.401 --> 00:46:21.613
They don't give Realisation so easily, no way.

00:46:21.814 --> 00:46:24.342
After going through lot of troubles,

00:46:24.543 --> 00:46:27.470
then the disciples get Realization,

00:46:27.671 --> 00:46:33.223
but their Realization establishes in them, strongly.

00:46:33.424 --> 00:46:35.877
Instead, you all have got Realization easily

00:46:36.078 --> 00:46:40.034
but your past things are still lingering in your brain.

00:46:41.251 --> 00:46:42.985
These problems are still with you.

00:46:43.186 --> 00:46:44.808
Now what to do with them?

00:46:45.009 --> 00:46:46.817
They need to be shaken off.

00:46:47.018 --> 00:46:49.245
All these things which we have accumulated

00:46:49.446 --> 00:46:51.465
need to be pushed away, totally finished.

00:46:51.666 --> 00:46:53.629
And for that there is no need to make a show,

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:57.319
renounce the world or leave the home and family.

00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:03.120
Any kind of "Dravidi Pranayama" (breathing technique) is not required.

00:47:03.321 --> 00:47:06.890
But one thing is a must,

00:47:07.766 --> 00:47:10.497
your temptation of the taste should be reduced,

00:47:10.698 --> 00:47:13.596
should be reduced gradually.

00:47:14.132 --> 00:47:16.134
You should become oblivious of taste.

00:47:16.335 --> 00:47:17.882
It is very important.

00:47:18.083 --> 00:47:20.977
Oblivion to the taste is a great quality.

00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:24.685
People get enraged if they do not get food of their choice.

00:47:24.886 --> 00:47:30.622
They throw away their plates, beat their servants and what not?

00:47:30.823 --> 00:47:34.073
If you can conquer your tongue,

00:47:35.783 --> 00:47:40.496
then many sweet shops may close down, in My opinion.

00:47:40.697 --> 00:47:45.155
However, I mean to say

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.622
that the body should not be given much importance.

00:47:48.823 --> 00:47:50.637
If the body needs comfort,

00:47:50.838 --> 00:47:54.108
like you want to sleep on a bed and can't sleep on the ground,

00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:56.467
then for ten days sleep on the ground.

00:47:56.668 --> 00:47:58.166
How can you not sleep like that?

00:47:58.367 --> 00:48:01.693
You should not give up until you have enslaved your body.

00:48:01.894 --> 00:48:05.495
Your attention should go away from your comfort.

00:48:05.696 --> 00:48:09.486
There are many people who cannot travel by bus,

00:48:09.687 --> 00:48:13.432
because they can only go by car.

00:48:13.633 --> 00:48:16.033
Then they ask for a car from here, there,

00:48:16.234 --> 00:48:17.942
sit in this car, sit in that car...

00:48:18.143 --> 00:48:19.958
But none of them will think:

00:48:20.159 --> 00:48:23.978
"Come, let me travel by bus today and see what happens?"

00:48:24.179 --> 00:48:26.966
And earlier there were no buses also, so people used to walk.

00:48:27.167 --> 00:48:30.173
When we were in school, we used to walk five miles daily,

00:48:30.374 --> 00:48:33.506
though we had car and everything.

00:48:33.916 --> 00:48:36.907
Such parents we had.

00:48:37.108 --> 00:48:40.022
But we ourselves were very fond of walking barefoot,

00:48:40.223 --> 00:48:44.070
without shoes, carrying slippers in our hand.

00:48:44.271 --> 00:48:47.639
Because of the vibrations it was good to walk on the earth.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:52.730
You should also start walking without shoes and slippers sometimes.

00:48:52.931 --> 00:48:55.306
It is very important and very beneficial.

00:48:55.507 --> 00:48:59.064
Mother Earth will get vibrations and you will also feel nice.

00:48:59.265 --> 00:49:04.487
In everything, we have become excessively comfort loving people.

00:49:04.688 --> 00:49:08.710
We have become just like the few Nawabs of earlier days.

00:49:08.911 --> 00:49:11.422
And what did we get? We can get nothing from that.

00:49:11.623 --> 00:49:14.911
We will waste our whole lives by being enslaved to these things.

00:49:15.112 --> 00:49:16.917
We have to reduce this slavery,

00:49:17.118 --> 00:49:21.454
and establish within us the essence (tattwa) of Param Shiva.

00:49:21.655 --> 00:49:26.157
And for that it is essential that everything else becomes unimportant.

00:49:26.358 --> 00:49:29.385
Today wear this, tomorrow wear that,

00:49:29.586 --> 00:49:32.581
and that will match with this dress and so on.

00:49:32.782 --> 00:49:35.121
Whatever is available accept it.

00:49:35.322 --> 00:49:38.022
Whatever comes your way wear that.

00:49:38.223 --> 00:49:39.513
It is not a problem,

00:49:39.712 --> 00:49:42.158
you will not get in any trouble because of that.

00:49:42.359 --> 00:49:46.261
On the contrary you will be happy that you are a contented person:

00:49:46.462 --> 00:49:50.640
"Whatever I got, I accepted with content".

00:49:50.841 --> 00:49:53.098
Nowadays in our Nagpur,

00:49:53.299 --> 00:49:55.767
I don't know if the situation is same here as well,

00:49:55.968 --> 00:49:59.416
the price of the gas cylinder has gone up by Rs. 16.

00:49:59.617 --> 00:50:02.271
Then the photos of protesting women came in the newspaper,

00:50:02.472 --> 00:50:04.255
all well dressed, with heavy make-up.

00:50:04.456 --> 00:50:08.838
I said that their powder itself must be worth Rs. 15.

00:50:12.884 --> 00:50:15.830
These people think: "If others are going for strike,

00:50:16.013 --> 00:50:17.661
then we are also joining".

00:50:17.862 --> 00:50:18.994
What for?

00:50:19.195 --> 00:50:20.856
Because the price increased by Rs. 15.

00:50:21.057 --> 00:50:24.990
Can't you see that your salary has also increased?

00:50:25.672 --> 00:50:30.399
Earlier, supposing, we were paying Rs. 20-25  to our servants,

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.817
today we pay Rs. 2500.

00:50:33.018 --> 00:50:36.832
He also complains, though he gets clothes and other things also.

00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:41.333
Salaries have increased so much, then would the prices not increase?

00:50:41.534 --> 00:50:44.693
Where the salaries increase, prices also go up.

00:50:44.894 --> 00:50:48.746
It is told that in Lanka (tr.n. fom Ramayana)

00:50:48.947 --> 00:50:51.360
there were gold bricks, as currency.

00:50:51.561 --> 00:50:54.779
Now, one person went to get gold bricks.

00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:57.721
He found that, after working for one day

00:50:57.922 --> 00:50:59.621
he recieved two gold bricks.

00:50:59.822 --> 00:51:03.282
After that he went to a barber shop for shave.

00:51:03.483 --> 00:51:07.262
He asked the barber: “What are the charges?” “Two bricks”.

00:51:07.463 --> 00:51:09.767
As the income, so the expenses.

00:51:09.968 --> 00:51:11.566
It is a matter of discretion.

00:51:11.767 --> 00:51:14.556
What is the point in grumbling over the price rise, this and that?

00:51:14.763 --> 00:51:17.390
They all do this even to Me.

00:51:17.591 --> 00:51:19.797
How much has your salary increased?

00:51:20.013 --> 00:51:22.233
Very, very much! Then?

00:51:22.434 --> 00:51:24.728
Then why to keep crying about the inflation?

00:51:24.929 --> 00:51:27.770
When the salary increases, price increase is bound to happen.

00:51:27.971 --> 00:51:31.183
Your salary increases and prices remain the same, how is it possible?

00:51:31.384 --> 00:51:34.707
It's a very simple thing, if we learn this,

00:51:34.908 --> 00:51:38.803
then socially also we could achieve Shiva tattwa.

00:51:39.004 --> 00:51:42.663
Now, Gandhiji was an amazing person.

00:51:42.864 --> 00:51:45.184
I was in his ashram with him.

00:51:45.385 --> 00:51:47.940
I was not bothered at all, but others used to cry.

00:51:48.141 --> 00:51:50.876
Because his principle was,

00:51:51.077 --> 00:51:53.505
that all the people had to clean everbody's bathroom,

00:51:53.706 --> 00:51:55.948
the guests' bathroom and everyone's.

00:51:56.149 --> 00:51:59.658
And there was no sweeper at all.

00:52:00.207 --> 00:52:03.499
Wash your own clothes, wash your own plates.

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:08.805
And the meal consisted of boiled food with mustard oil on top of it.

00:52:09.171 --> 00:52:13.238
Now, tell Me how many Indians can eat that type of food?

00:52:13.439 --> 00:52:16.335
People used to stay there for 2-3 days and then run away.

00:52:16.536 --> 00:52:17.848
This was the situation.

00:52:18.049 --> 00:52:21.423
Now, you people also should learn to less bother about the taste.

00:52:21.624 --> 00:52:23.980
Now, as far as oblivion to taste is concerned,

00:52:24.181 --> 00:52:26.430
I don't know how I can do it,

00:52:26.631 --> 00:52:32.288
but you can try to eat only boiled food for a few days.

00:52:40.441 --> 00:52:43.010
No mother would say such a thing to her children.

00:52:43.211 --> 00:52:46.128
But what can I do? It is damaging your Shiva tattwa.

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:48.577
If all of your attention is on eating and drinking,

00:52:48.778 --> 00:52:50.538
then your Shiva tattwa will disappear

00:52:50.739 --> 00:52:53.060
and all the efforts will go to waste.

00:52:53.261 --> 00:52:58.079
So, to get involved too much in eating, is not good.

00:52:59.017 --> 00:53:02.201
In olden days, people used to fast for a day or two.

00:53:02.402 --> 00:53:07.528
Something or the other they used to sacrifice from their side.

00:53:08.006 --> 00:53:10.570
But nowadays it is very difficult to say,

00:53:10.771 --> 00:53:14.587
that if you become contented, become satisfied,

00:53:14.788 --> 00:53:18.219
then it is not necessary for you, absolutely not required,

00:53:18.418 --> 00:53:22.073
to talk all the time about eating and drinking

00:53:22.274 --> 00:53:24.230
and invite others for supper.

00:53:24.431 --> 00:53:27.999
Then, in India we have caste system.

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.276
Kayasth are separate,

00:53:30.477 --> 00:53:35.358
Hindu brahmins are separate and others are separate, even now.

00:53:35.559 --> 00:53:36.834
Now what happens,

00:53:37.035 --> 00:53:39.539
is that all the kayashth Sahaja Yogis form one group,

00:53:39.740 --> 00:53:41.750
brahmin Sahaja Yogis form another group.

00:53:41.951 --> 00:53:43.805
Now you all have become Sahaja Yogis,

00:53:44.006 --> 00:53:46.489
then why are you still worried about all this brahminism?

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:49.891
Then kayasth will invite other kayasths for a meal.

00:53:50.092 --> 00:53:52.559
And brahmins will invite other brahmins for a meal.

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.805
If you have to do this kind of stupidity,

00:53:55.006 --> 00:53:57.083
then why did you come to Sahaja Yoga?

00:53:57.284 --> 00:54:00.771
There is no caste and creed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:00.972 --> 00:54:04.485
When you cannot drop this fundamentally wrong thing,

00:54:04.686 --> 00:54:07.033
then what else can you drop?

00:54:07.234 --> 00:54:09.636
Did Shiv Ji bother about caste and creed?

00:54:09.837 --> 00:54:12.747
Even someone with a blind eye,

00:54:12.948 --> 00:54:15.628
someone with broken leg, someone with broken hands,

00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:18.080
all kind of deformed people

00:54:18.281 --> 00:54:20.788
accompanied Him in His marriage procession.

00:54:20.989 --> 00:54:28.016
So when Shiva tattwa is like this it is wrong for you to be critical

00:54:28.217 --> 00:54:35.059
and say: "I am very particular that the food should be like this".

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:38.322
And then separate food for kayasth, separate for brahmins,

00:54:38.523 --> 00:54:41.419
separate for other casts and separate for rajputs,

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:43.195
separate for everyone:

00:54:43.396 --> 00:54:45.181
"Now, we want only that food".

00:54:45.382 --> 00:54:49.144
I have never understood, till now I could not understand,

00:54:49.345 --> 00:54:52.868
if there is more pleasure in eating different foods,

00:54:53.069 --> 00:54:57.031
then why do these people ask only for a particular type of food.

00:54:57.588 --> 00:55:00.802
What is the reason? For bengalies, bengali food,

00:55:01.003 --> 00:55:04.044
for madrasis, madrasi food.

00:55:04.457 --> 00:55:08.985
Once I asked in our Airforce, I mean in the Airlines:

00:55:09.186 --> 00:55:11.685
"Why there is no good standard food?”.

00:55:11.886 --> 00:55:16.922
They said: "Mother, tell us what is India's standard food?".

00:55:17.123 --> 00:55:19.231
This is very true.

00:55:19.432 --> 00:55:22.509
If you prepare some food, they will say: "This is Madrasi food".

00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:28.013
Madrasi will say: "This is Bihari food", this and that and that.

00:55:28.214 --> 00:55:33.481
So, that's why you should eat all types of food.

00:55:35.524 --> 00:55:37.997
Because everything starts from here itself.

00:55:38.172 --> 00:55:40.592
This Vaikhari, your speech,

00:55:40.759 --> 00:55:44.316
in your speech as well, there should be sweetness,

00:55:44.517 --> 00:55:46.509
there should be madhurya.

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:49.130
In the smiles also, it feels sometimes,

00:55:49.331 --> 00:55:52.825
as if Ravana is emerging out of the mouth.

00:55:53.189 --> 00:55:55.571
Then what can be said about the way they talk?

00:55:55.772 --> 00:55:59.812
And when they talk, it feels as if Chandika is talking.

00:56:00.013 --> 00:56:03.427
Women particularly create this fuss.

00:56:03.628 --> 00:56:06.385
Even men do it.

00:56:06.586 --> 00:56:09.483
Various weird things have come up letely.

00:56:09.684 --> 00:56:13.765
Where is Shiva tattwa in this?

00:56:14.224 --> 00:56:18.237
Lord Shiva is the ocean of love.

00:56:18.744 --> 00:56:22.767
He bestows boons even on rakshasas.

00:56:23.929 --> 00:56:26.822
Shri Shiva who has bestowed boons even on rakshasas -

00:56:27.023 --> 00:56:29.527
if we have to awaken His tattawa within us,

00:56:29.728 --> 00:56:34.123
then how could we get entangled in petty matters like these?

00:56:34.324 --> 00:56:37.090
How can we do this? Tell me.

00:56:37.838 --> 00:56:41.693
The way we criticize each other,

00:56:41.894 --> 00:56:45.319
some say "He is superior", some say "He is inferior",

00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.851
it is not like Lord Shiva.

00:56:48.052 --> 00:56:52.282
The streams of love are flowing within Lord Shiva.

00:56:53.333 --> 00:56:56.633
And while flowing in these streams of love –

00:56:56.834 --> 00:57:02.321
you should not say such baseless things.

00:57:02.538 --> 00:57:05.133
There is no use of it.

00:57:06.113 --> 00:57:08.083
Mutual love,

00:57:08.284 --> 00:57:10.568
mutual understanding

00:57:10.769 --> 00:57:16.997
and the company of each other should be enjoyed.

00:57:17.198 --> 00:57:18.744
Now definitely,

00:57:18.945 --> 00:57:21.994
Sahaja Yogis do not fight with each other, I have seen that.

00:57:22.195 --> 00:57:24.912
And when they meet each other, they meet with love.

00:57:25.113 --> 00:57:29.416
But still, even now very petty matters, which are very personal,

00:57:29.617 --> 00:57:33.149
like eating, drinking, moving around and other daily activities,

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:35.616
need to be corrected.

00:57:36.389 --> 00:57:39.418
If we correct them it will be wonderful.

00:57:39.619 --> 00:57:43.160
Your attention will go towards your heart,

00:57:43.382 --> 00:57:46.467
and will not remain in these things,

00:57:46.668 --> 00:57:48.676
will not remain in these matters.

00:57:48.877 --> 00:57:51.236
This disease is more in foreign countries.

00:57:51.437 --> 00:57:55.215
That's why many enterpreneurs are popping up

00:57:55.416 --> 00:57:58.157
and they manufacture various kinds of things.

00:57:58.358 --> 00:58:03.786
And those who wear such things start thinking very high of themselves.

00:58:04.649 --> 00:58:07.821
Particularly in Italy this is quite popular.

00:58:08.022 --> 00:58:13.412
But you should not get caught in all these things.

00:58:13.859 --> 00:58:15.936
You should lead a simple life.

00:58:16.137 --> 00:58:20.635
In our country, people who lead a simple life

00:58:20.836 --> 00:58:23.047
have attained great heights.

00:58:23.248 --> 00:58:25.883
Others cannot achieve this.

00:58:26.084 --> 00:58:30.589
In the olden days when Gandhiji asked everyone to wear khadi cloth,

00:58:30.790 --> 00:58:33.405
everyone obeyed and wore khadi.

00:58:33.606 --> 00:58:36.355
He made such a rule

00:58:36.556 --> 00:58:39.129
and set everybody right.

00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:42.714
But now you have to set yourself right.

00:58:42.915 --> 00:58:47.457
Because you yourself are the light of the Spirit,

00:58:47.658 --> 00:58:53.601
you youreself have come under the protection of Shri Shiva.

00:58:54.291 --> 00:58:56.821
You have to correct yourself on your own.

00:58:57.022 --> 00:58:59.663
You don't need to correct others,

00:58:59.864 --> 00:59:01.435
but just correct yourself

00:59:01.618 --> 00:59:04.475
and feel blessed that you are a Self Realized person.

00:59:04.676 --> 00:59:06.344
How many were there earlier?

00:59:06.545 --> 00:59:09.378
Only a few of them and people used to kill them as well.

00:59:09.579 --> 00:59:13.984
Today you are in thousands, so start doing this.

00:59:14.185 --> 00:59:16.083
Sweetness in your talk,

00:59:16.284 --> 00:59:18.432
not superficially but from the heart.

00:59:18.633 --> 00:59:23.020
Whatever you say from your heart, never hurts anyone.

00:59:23.604 --> 00:59:25.243
So you talk from your heart,

00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:27.996
with children, with elderly people,

00:59:28.197 --> 00:59:30.577
following the "maryadas" of good conduct.

00:59:30.778 --> 00:59:34.664
When you make yourself happy,

00:59:34.865 --> 00:59:37.124
you will make others happy as well.

00:59:37.325 --> 00:59:42.859
But, if the blessing of Shri Shiva is missing within you,

00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:46.128
which makes you content,

00:59:46.393 --> 00:59:48.397
nothing else can make you content.

00:59:48.598 --> 00:59:52.841
So pay attention to yourself and see: "Am I content or not?

00:59:53.042 --> 00:59:54.921
Do I have satisfaction or not?

00:59:55.122 --> 01:00:01.254
Do I get angry with others over small, small things

01:00:01.455 --> 01:00:04.509
or do I find faults with them?

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:07.413
Then definitely there is something wrong with me".

01:00:07.614 --> 01:00:11.400
And only after seeing these faults, you can get cleansed.

01:00:11.601 --> 01:00:15.924
Until you see something, how can you clean it?

01:00:16.125 --> 01:00:17.994
This cleansing is much needed.

01:00:18.193 --> 01:00:19.952
And only by this cleansing,

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:26.069
you can have the "darshan" of God Almighty within yourself.

01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:28.925
And all the people can have His "darshan" as well.

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:32.742
Wish you have infinite blessings.

01:00:45.246 --> 01:00:48.788
It's a very long lecture I have given in Hindi language

01:00:48.989 --> 01:00:53.815
and because there are very few, also, Sahaja Yogis from abroad.

01:00:54.016 --> 01:00:59.050
What I was telling them was that about the principle of Shiva

01:00:59.251 --> 01:01:01.961
is in your heart,

01:01:02.162 --> 01:01:08.257
and that reflection is not on a chakra, but on a… like a mirror.

01:01:08.458 --> 01:01:13.484
Now, whatever is visible of you

01:01:14.086 --> 01:01:16.108
is this mirror.

01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:19.949
In this mirror, what reflection you have?

01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:24.924
Do you have a reflection, which is clear, clean?

01:01:25.125 --> 01:01:27.773
Have you cleaned your heart?

01:01:27.974 --> 01:01:34.694
Have you cleaned your mirror that is reflecting?

01:01:34.895 --> 01:01:36.980
That is what one has to see.

01:01:37.181 --> 01:01:39.934
Now, what I told them at length was this,

01:01:40.135 --> 01:01:45.225
that how there are six enemies we have got.

01:01:45.426 --> 01:01:51.498
And all these six enemies, one after another, try to corrupt us.

01:01:51.894 --> 01:01:54.062
Out of that, I have told them about five.

01:01:54.263 --> 01:01:59.354
The sixth one doesn’t exist much in India, which we call as lust,

01:01:59.555 --> 01:02:00.975
it's much less.

01:02:01.176 --> 01:02:04.749
But, for foreign countries one has to know

01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:08.949
that it is one of the major things that they have in the West,

01:02:09.150 --> 01:02:12.993
because they think lustful life is the only life worth living.

01:02:13.194 --> 01:02:15.758
Beyond that is Shiva.

01:02:16.678 --> 01:02:22.232
And that’s why we have to understood that, we have to understand

01:02:22.433 --> 01:02:24.814
that in our heart,

01:02:25.015 --> 01:02:30.956
the reflection of Shiva is only possible in complete form

01:02:31.157 --> 01:02:33.506
when we have cleaned our heart.

01:02:33.707 --> 01:02:35.787
To have malice for others,

01:02:35.986 --> 01:02:39.795
to have lust for others,

01:02:39.996 --> 01:02:44.075
to have anger for others,

01:02:44.424 --> 01:02:47.941
to have envy for others,

01:02:48.419 --> 01:02:51.554
all these reactions within us act,

01:02:51.755 --> 01:02:54.678
and our heart becomes like a stone,

01:02:54.877 --> 01:02:57.212
it cannot reflect.

01:02:57.413 --> 01:03:00.675
So, if you have to reflect the quality of Shiva,

01:03:00.876 --> 01:03:04.046
which is very important today, in this Kali Yuga...

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:09.071
Very, there are very few people who are really reflecting

01:03:09.378 --> 01:03:14.376
the image of Shiva in their own character.

01:03:14.577 --> 01:03:16.947
So, it is important to watch yourself

01:03:17.122 --> 01:03:19.540
and see for yourself what’s wrong with you:

01:03:19.741 --> 01:03:22.267
"Where am I? Where is my attention going?

01:03:22.468 --> 01:03:24.774
Where am I going? What am I doing?",

01:03:24.975 --> 01:03:29.056
if you go on judging yourself and not others.

01:03:29.257 --> 01:03:32.490
Also, one of the western things is that,

01:03:32.691 --> 01:03:38.395
they have a right to criticize others, everybody.

01:03:38.596 --> 01:03:40.745
"I like it, I don’t like it”.

01:03:40.946 --> 01:03:43.654
Who are you? Why do you say such a thing?

01:03:43.855 --> 01:03:47.303
Somebody had made a beautiful, say, arrangement for you;

01:03:47.504 --> 01:03:51.249
you sit in his house and nicely say:  “I don’t like it”,

01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:54.239
to hurt that person.

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:57.057
After all, who are you?

01:03:57.272 --> 01:03:59.705
What do you think of yourself?

01:03:59.906 --> 01:04:01.361
Who are you to judge?

01:04:01.562 --> 01:04:04.460
For Sahaja Yoga, Yogis, is prohibited

01:04:04.661 --> 01:04:07.944
to say, “I like” and “I don’t like.”

01:04:08.145 --> 01:04:10.731
It's prohibited.

01:04:10.932 --> 01:04:14.165
Look at Shiva. He likes everything.

01:04:14.366 --> 01:04:17.804
What He wears? Also snakes.

01:04:18.005 --> 01:04:20.558
He likes all kinds of animals.

01:04:20.759 --> 01:04:22.421
Every type of thing

01:04:22.622 --> 01:04:26.216
that we think is not good, ugly, for Him they are not.

01:04:26.417 --> 01:04:31.170
For example, in His wedding He took with Him, in His bharat,

01:04:31.371 --> 01:04:34.064
people who were all infirm,

01:04:34.366 --> 01:04:36.146
some people had one leg,

01:04:36.347 --> 01:04:39.864
some people had limbs broken down,

01:04:40.065 --> 01:04:42.443
some had only one eye.

01:04:42.678 --> 01:04:45.024
All such people He carried with them.

01:04:45.225 --> 01:04:48.343
To Him, these people were very dear

01:04:48.544 --> 01:04:50.186
and He looked after them,

01:04:50.387 --> 01:04:53.101
because He is the source of joy.

01:04:53.302 --> 01:04:55.455
He is the One who gives us joy

01:04:55.656 --> 01:04:58.025
and the One that makes us joyous.

01:04:58.226 --> 01:05:00.507
The real joy is only possible

01:05:00.708 --> 01:05:04.329
if in your heart His reflection is there.

01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:07.036
But if your heart is full of all things,

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:09.361
then once I have described,

01:05:09.562 --> 01:05:14.896
it becomes a dirty, very, very dirty mirror.

01:05:15.097 --> 01:05:17.348
Very surprising, I told them also,

01:05:17.523 --> 01:05:21.762
that compared to Indians, Westerners are not so particular -

01:05:21.963 --> 01:05:25.846
Western Sahaja Yogis - are not so particular about their comfort.

01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:28.813
Though they come from a very materialistic surrounding,

01:05:29.014 --> 01:05:30.564
they are not so much bothered.

01:05:30.765 --> 01:05:33.559
They can live anywhere, they can be happy anywhere.

01:05:33.694 --> 01:05:36.126
That’s a very good stage they have reached

01:05:36.327 --> 01:05:39.618
and that’s what’s the Indians must try to follow.

01:05:39.819 --> 01:05:42.679
And don’t pay attention to nonsensical things.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:47.393
It is not necessary to waste your energy on nonsensical thing.

01:05:47.594 --> 01:05:53.827
Then only you can have a real bhakti for your Self, for your Atma

01:05:54.028 --> 01:05:56.377
and that is what needed today,

01:05:56.568 --> 01:06:02.038
that your Spirit should shine in your character, in your behavior

01:06:02.239 --> 01:06:05.428
and in your personality.

01:06:05.629 --> 01:06:08.680
If that happens, then you have achieved,

01:06:08.856 --> 01:06:12.093
what Sahaja Yoga wanted to do for you.

01:06:12.294 --> 01:06:14.913
It's important today, very important.

01:06:15.114 --> 01:06:18.190
If you read the newspapers, you can’t read it.

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:23.541
And what you need is to change - the transformation -

01:06:23.742 --> 01:06:26.772
as we in Hindi call it ‘pariwartan’

01:06:26.973 --> 01:06:31.247
of human beings into Selfhood, into Self-awareness,

01:06:31.448 --> 01:06:33.568
into the Spirit.

01:06:33.769 --> 01:06:35.042
This has to be done,

01:06:35.243 --> 01:06:38.117
and the time has come this evolutionary process has started.

01:06:38.318 --> 01:06:40.285
There are so many of them who have got it.

01:06:40.486 --> 01:06:47.507
Now the old saints and people who were gurus, real gurus,

01:06:47.708 --> 01:06:52.840
they used to really test the disciples

01:06:53.041 --> 01:06:57.275
by making them stand on their heads for years together,

01:06:57.476 --> 01:07:01.693
sometimes put them in the water, do all kinds of things.

01:07:02.159 --> 01:07:04.029
They used to beat them

01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:08.225
and they were very harsh, testing all of them.

01:07:08.426 --> 01:07:12.723
And then only, one of them used to get Realization.

01:07:13.621 --> 01:07:15.836
Now, what I thought of:

01:07:16.037 --> 01:07:20.075
"It takes too much time to cleanse them,

01:07:20.276 --> 01:07:25.651
to put them into all kinds of dresses, this that,

01:07:25.867 --> 01:07:29.824
send them to Himalayas or to Gobi Desert.

01:07:30.025 --> 01:07:32.186
I thought it will take too much time.

01:07:32.387 --> 01:07:37.023
I said why not first enlighten them, give them the light?

01:07:37.224 --> 01:07:39.342
In that light they can see their problems

01:07:39.543 --> 01:07:41.750
and they will themselves correct themself.

01:07:41.951 --> 01:07:43.628
They will be their own guru.

01:07:43.835 --> 01:07:47.232
And it was successful. It was good.

01:07:47.433 --> 01:07:50.486
Now you can see for yourself what you are doing,

01:07:50.687 --> 01:07:57.646
what is your problem, what makes you so much different from others

01:07:57.847 --> 01:08:00.330
and what will elevate you.

01:08:00.531 --> 01:08:05.509
Because Sadashiva’s place is above the head,

01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:08.684
above your thoughts, above your mind,

01:08:08.885 --> 01:08:10.313
above your emotions.

01:08:10.514 --> 01:08:11.668
It’s here.

01:08:11.869 --> 01:08:14.052
And you have to cross this limit.

01:08:14.253 --> 01:08:16.697
Only when you do not react to things,

01:08:16.898 --> 01:08:23.658
and also to you nothing is important than Shiva,

01:08:23.859 --> 01:08:25.714
then only it will work out.

01:08:25.915 --> 01:08:28.452
So, in some things Indians have to learn,

01:08:28.653 --> 01:08:32.246
and in some things you foreigners have to learn.

01:08:32.447 --> 01:08:35.418
So many things you have done, I must thank you very much.

01:08:35.619 --> 01:08:37.564
People used to think that I cannot do anything.

01:08:37.765 --> 01:08:39.347
I mean you have given up drinking,

01:08:39.548 --> 01:08:41.839
you have given up all kinds of bad habits,

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.155
you are no more womanizers, your attention is so clean.

01:08:45.356 --> 01:08:48.614
So many things you have done, which is really praise-worthy.

01:08:48.815 --> 01:08:50.201
But still,

01:08:50.432 --> 01:08:54.263
you must learn that still there are certain things lingering,

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.501
which must be cleared out

01:08:56.702 --> 01:08:59.500
and must be absolutely finished.

01:08:59.701 --> 01:09:02.258
You don’t have very much politics

01:09:02.459 --> 01:09:06.801
but sometimes there is also politics, group forming is there.

01:09:06.993 --> 01:09:08.393
All this has to go away.

01:09:08.594 --> 01:09:12.439
Because for Shiva, what is this? The whole universe is at His feet.

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:17.432
To Him to have a one group here and a one group there,

01:09:17.633 --> 01:09:19.217
all that doesn’t matter.

01:09:19.418 --> 01:09:23.001
To Him, it doesn’t come into His head, you see.

01:09:23.202 --> 01:09:28.094
For a person like a very big ocean, it touches many shores.

01:09:28.295 --> 01:09:30.876
But in itself it is a big ocean.

01:09:31.106 --> 01:09:33.683
In the same way is Shiva principle.

01:09:33.884 --> 01:09:36.969
And you all should develop that principle of Shiva.

01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:39.000
And then see the joy.

01:09:39.201 --> 01:09:43.878
the joy of this great ocean of love.

01:09:44.079 --> 01:09:47.444
May God bless you.
