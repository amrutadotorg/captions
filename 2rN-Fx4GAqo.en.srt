1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:25,026
Today I was thinking of talking, telling you
about the Sahaja Culture.

2
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:31,636
Now we are formed in dharma, Vishwa Dharma.

3
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:35,291
But it must have a culture.

4
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:42,890
So far in all the religions there is no combination
of religion and culture.

5
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,420
No religion has.

6
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,810
That's why everywhere you find different cultures.

7
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:54,560
Say in India, people who follow Hindu religion
have different cultures in different places.

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,191
They are living in Lucknow, or say in U.P.,
they have a Muslim culture.

9
00:01:00,191 --> 00:01:02,471
More Islamic style.

10
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:07,761
They'll eat in one plate, do all kinds of
things which normally a South Indian won't

11
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:13,441
do, and the South Indians have a different
culture from Maharashtrians.

12
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:19,771
So even in a religion like Hindu religion
where culture is important, very important,

13
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:22,191
we find varieties.

14
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:28,180
So the cultures get influenced by the neighboring
cultures or surrounding cultures, and that's

15
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,341
how people get lost.

16
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:38,391
When you establish a religion like this, Vishwa
Dharma, it's not like any other religion.

17
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:45,091
It's the real religion within us, and this
reality comes to us because now we are one

18
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:46,571
with the Spirit.

19
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:52,871
So when we talk of Sahaja Culture, it is the
culture of the Spirit.

20
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:53,871
Now what is a culture?

21
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:56,421
First of all let us see what is a culture
is.

22
00:01:56,421 --> 00:02:02,151
So the culture is the pattern of behavior
we have with others.

23
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:07,211
Is a common pattern of behavior we are supposed
to have with others.

24
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:11,551
Like in English language, for example, we'll
say "Thank you".

25
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:15,911
Even if somebody murders, you may say, "Thank
you".

26
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:22,931
Or the person who murders you can say, "Sorry".

27
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:27,811
On the phone one may say, just if they say
something you can't hear, "Sorry?"

28
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:28,811
Every time, "Sorry".

29
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:31,082
As if "sorry" is a word so easily to be used.

30
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:33,781
I mean if you are sorry, why are you sorry
for that?

31
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:34,781
"Sorry?"

32
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:38,631
On the phone they used to first say, "I beg
your pardon?", was sensible; but now I find

33
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:41,851
everybody, A to Z, says, "Sorry?"

34
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:45,591
I mean, it has no meaning, because what are
you sorry about?

35
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:47,071
Says "Sorry?"

36
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:48,682
For everything they are sorry.

37
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:50,781
Or we can say in English language, when we
speak, "I'm afraid".

38
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:53,241
You see, it's very common, "I'm afraid".

39
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:55,381
What are you afraid of?

40
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:56,981
The whole world is afraid of you.

41
00:02:56,981 --> 00:03:06,061
So this is the culture, what we talk of, any
culture as such, becomes artificial, is not

42
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,241
spontaneous, doesn't come from reality.

43
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:15,431
It has no meaning; sometimes it is pointless,
absolutely pointless to stick to certain cultures.

44
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,841
So the culture of the Spirit doesn't change.

45
00:03:18,841 --> 00:03:24,961
It's universal, and is higher than any other
culture.

46
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:27,461
Apart from that it integrates all the essences
of all the cultures.

47
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:36,261
So
it emanates from the spirit.

48
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:39,611
Now, spirit has two sides.

49
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:44,293
One side which you see, the another you don't
see, like the moon.

50
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:50,241
The side you see is outside with other people,
other Sahaja Yogis, other people, other societies,

51
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:58,021
which are not yourself, absolutely.

52
00:03:58,021 --> 00:04:05,571
The other side you don't see is the relationship
with God Almighty, relationship with your

53
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:06,741
Mother.

54
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:16,321
If the other side is not all right, the behavioral
side outside could become artificial, could

55
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:19,861
become crooked and not Sahaj.

56
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:24,131
So it's the other way round than any other
culture.

57
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,881
To know any other culture what do we go?

58
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:31,421
We see how they talk, what is their language,
how they speak, how they behave: all the outside

59
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:32,801
things we get.

60
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:39,041
We must know "thank you" if we want to know
English language, must know "thank you", "please",

61
00:04:39,041 --> 00:04:40,661
all that.

62
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:46,831
But if you want to know the Sahaja culture,
you have to know your Mother, and you have

63
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:48,181
to know God Almighty.

64
00:04:48,181 --> 00:04:55,641
And the relationship between your Mother and
the God Almighty has to be absolutely perfect.

65
00:04:55,641 --> 00:04:59,151
Then there's no problem.

66
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:07,191
But that, the relationship, if it is not all
right, you cannot have artificial Sahaj culture.

67
00:05:07,191 --> 00:05:09,161
That is one thing for sure.

68
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:13,941
Artificial Sahaj culture is not all right.

69
00:05:13,941 --> 00:05:20,762
I would say that India has, in its basics,
the culture of the spirit, India has; because

70
00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:33,831
for traditions and traditions in India, and
for ages, people have been seeking the truth.

71
00:05:33,831 --> 00:05:40,891
Spiritually they are endowed, because of the
saints.

72
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:49,061
They are blessed specially because they have
been seekers, not of material things, but

73
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:50,951
of the spirit.

74
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:58,881
Specially in Maharashtra, we should say, because
the Kundalini is there always like a magnet.

75
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:04,581
People are attracted because Shri Ganesha
being the magnet, attracted towards God and

76
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:05,581
spirit.

77
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:10,291
So they form a pattern, but there is lot of
artificiality in that also has grown.

78
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:19,411
We must admit that there is lot, lot of artificiality,
falsehood, nonsense that has grown into it,

79
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:25,061
because the religion fell into the hands of,
spiritual religion fell into the hands of

80
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:29,851
gross, horrible so-called Brahmins who were
not realized souls.

81
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:36,071
So the whole culture has become so nonsensical
sometimes that you don't know where to look.

82
00:06:36,071 --> 00:06:47,031
But to have the culture, first of all, culture
is developed through meditation, by facing

83
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,180
yourself.

84
00:06:50,180 --> 00:07:02,561
First of all you should face yourself, how
you feel about your Mother and about God Almighty.

85
00:07:02,561 --> 00:07:09,471
First of all, how much liberty you take of
your Mother?

86
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:14,801
How much granted, take for granted your Mother?

87
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:20,161
She's a Mahamaya.

88
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:24,171
Even the first "M" is difficult to understand.

89
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:32,441
So when you start taking liberties, all the
time putting your pressure on Her, all the

90
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:42,210
time trying to attract Her attention, Her
time, or writing letters eleven pages, all

91
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,111
that, is one side.

92
00:07:44,111 --> 00:07:49,451
Another side is complete indifference to your
Mother.

93
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:51,990
So it is to be known through your heart.

94
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:54,740
You don't have to talk to Me.

95
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,380
I know whose heart is pulsating.

96
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:05,131
Perhaps I'm the only person who knows really
what you are.

97
00:08:05,131 --> 00:08:07,701
You may not be knowing yourself also.

98
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:16,501
I may not say, but I know you in all details,
out of which I may say little bit, because

99
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:21,311
I am too gentle to say things.

100
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:23,711
Because again of Sahaj culture.

101
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:29,211
Because of Sahaj culture, I cannot say everything
to you on your face.

102
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:34,841
I'm correcting it, trying to correct it, correct
it; if not possible, then I say to you.

103
00:08:34,841 --> 00:08:38,491
Then in that you have to also see how much
worshipful you are.

104
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:45,821
Some people, though they spend more time with
Me, remain with Me, want to be with Me, it

105
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:51,051
is only when they feel surrendered, also.

106
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:54,332
So it should not be confused: if somebody
is spending more time with Me, you should

107
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:56,161
not condemn yourself for that.

108
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,451
It's all right.

109
00:08:57,451 --> 00:09:01,031
But how far you are surrendered is the point.

110
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:05,841
Now, if you are surrendered, how do you see
the surrendering in a person?

111
00:09:05,841 --> 00:09:12,221
You see it has one side and the another is
the expression.

112
00:09:12,221 --> 00:09:21,791
Say a person who is surrendered doesn't talk
much to Me, doesn't talk, he listens, doesn't

113
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:22,791
talk.

114
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:28,161
Common sense, he listens.

115
00:09:28,161 --> 00:09:34,341
Even people who are very good, I've seen when
I'm talking, they'll put in their own words

116
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:36,751
in between.

117
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:39,230
People who are very good, I should say.

118
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,941
So the surrendering is not full.

119
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:44,201
Then the time, they become very conscious
of the time.

120
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:49,051
Who has made the time?

121
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:52,561
But the person won't come directly and tell
Me, but tell somebody else, "Go and tell Mother,

122
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:54,941
She has to go at this time."

123
00:09:54,941 --> 00:10:03,671
I know everything, who tells whom, who goes
to whom, who is telling someone, who is time-bound.

124
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:07,211
And then I flout it.

125
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:13,671
I know what time to reach, what is the auspicious
time, how it will work out.

126
00:10:13,671 --> 00:10:17,401
Surrendering has to be to that point, that
you shouldn't worry.

127
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:21,581
I would say Dumahl is one of them who is a
very great surrendered fellow.

128
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:24,781
When I went there I was very tired, and he
said.

129
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:27,061
"Mother, if You want to rest You can rest."

130
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:28,230
I said, "Yes, I want to rest."

131
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,591
So he just left Me alone.

132
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:35,401
I was really very tired because I had a very
long journey, and then this and that, and

133
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,660
then I went down all the way there.

134
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,981
I thought, "I'll lie down, and sleep off.

135
00:10:41,981 --> 00:10:49,251
" Of course, as I know that everything has
to be done at right time, I just went down.

136
00:10:49,251 --> 00:10:59,651
And we had a program of My reception at one
place in a village, and they were all waiting

137
00:10:59,651 --> 00:11:02,621
for Me there.

138
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:03,621
And I was sleeping; he wouldn't wake Me up.

139
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,621
He wouldn't wake Me up.

140
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:08,101
He said, "Everything will be all right.

141
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:11,251
Tell them when Mother will come."

142
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:15,871
So there was sun on, they were all sitting
under the tree, sun was scorchingly hot.

143
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:20,781
They were nicely having a nice nap under the
tree and all that.

144
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:25,790
All the villagers arrived, everybody arrived,
everything worked out.

145
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:30,341
And when I got up it was about five-thirty,
then he told Me that, "Mother, I didn't tell

146
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:31,441
You the program."

147
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:32,681
He never tells Me.

148
00:11:32,681 --> 00:11:36,611
If I get something written, well and good,
but, "You were sleeping, I didn't want to

149
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:37,611
disturb You."

150
00:11:37,611 --> 00:11:38,611
"What's the program?"

151
00:11:38,611 --> 00:11:39,611
"It was at three o'clock."

152
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:40,611
I said, "Three o'clock.

153
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:41,611
Why didn't you tell Me?

154
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:43,801
Why didn't you wake Me?"

155
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:46,981
He said, "You were awake, I knew You were
awake, Mother.

156
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:47,981
It's all right."

157
00:11:47,981 --> 00:11:56,291
So we started off at six o'clock.

158
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,401
Sun had gone down.

159
00:11:57,401 --> 00:12:04,281
By that time they arranged beautiful lights
and fireworks and everything, and all the

160
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:08,061
rushing about was finished, they're very well
settled.

161
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:13,201
And the people from distant villages had also
arrived, and they had organized them so well,

162
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:18,311
and they had a proper time, and are very happy
that I came late because sun was not there,

163
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:19,661
so scorchingly hot.

164
00:12:19,661 --> 00:12:26,451
By the time we reached about seven o'clock
it was night and they illumined the lights,

165
00:12:26,451 --> 00:12:32,461
and the diwali like this was put up everywhere,
and they got everything, they had sufficient

166
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,350
time to do everything.

167
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:43,441
Then Dumahl said, "I knew, Mother, You are
awake, and You were managing."

168
00:12:43,441 --> 00:12:47,431
If one can understand that, then you will
not try to organize Me.

169
00:12:47,431 --> 00:12:51,001
You can just tell Me, "We have to leave at
this time."

170
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:57,181
But if I don't have to leave, I will not leave
whatever you may do.

171
00:12:57,181 --> 00:13:05,831
In My own sweet way; you will never find Me
obstinate, but I am.

172
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:09,161
Because I know what is right is what is right,
and has to be done that way.

173
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:12,801
But otherwise I'm very calm, I am not bothered.

174
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:18,571
I never organize you, I never hurry you, I
never do anything that should upset you.

175
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:28,381
Spirit is never upset, never excited, never
hurries, and never is what you call that "go-go"

176
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:30,501
business.

177
00:13:30,501 --> 00:13:32,331
Like now, we have to go to the airport.

178
00:13:32,331 --> 00:13:37,351
You'll find everybody was like an aeroplane
- round, round, round, round.

179
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:38,351
What has happened?

180
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,351
"Oh, we had to go?

181
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:40,351
We'd.."

182
00:13:40,351 --> 00:13:41,351
"We have to go, all right.

183
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:42,351
So what?"

184
00:13:42,351 --> 00:13:48,530
The whole thing is, all these excitements
and all these things come to us because we

185
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:49,850
are outside.

186
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,761
But if you are one with your spirit you're
absolutely calm, absolutely calm, "All right,

187
00:13:51,761 --> 00:13:56,361
we have to go, all right, we'll reach there.

188
00:13:56,361 --> 00:13:57,771
Doesn't matter."

189
00:13:57,771 --> 00:14:03,131
The other day we had to go for some shopping,
I was trying to buy some saris for Indian

190
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:04,131
ladies.

191
00:14:04,131 --> 00:14:05,341
We got lost.

192
00:14:05,341 --> 00:14:06,831
I never bothered them at all.

193
00:14:06,831 --> 00:14:09,691
They were going round and round, and round
and round.

194
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:13,751
And then Danny realized and said, "I think
perhaps we had to leave vibrations in all

195
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:14,751
these places."

196
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:16,271
I said, "Correct."

197
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:19,221
And for about two hours I think, we were roaming
about.

198
00:14:19,221 --> 00:14:21,220
Anybody else would be saying, "What's this?

199
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,071
You can't find the place, what's the matter
with you?”

200
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,071
Calm.

201
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:30,290
We reached the shop at the right time, got
everything at the right time, did everything,

202
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:31,581
came back at right time.

203
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:34,821
Everything was first class, nothing went wrong.

204
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:39,321
But anybody in My place, I tell you, that
time would have been, "Oh God, this, that."

205
00:14:39,321 --> 00:14:40,321
Why are you saving time?

206
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:45,331
For what are you saving time?

207
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:49,371
So we miss the present, and that's one thing
spirit never misses.

208
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:52,321
It's always in the present.

209
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:56,081
That's the reality.

210
00:14:56,081 --> 00:15:02,331
Now in the West people are very futuristic,
extremely futuristic, and their futuristicness

211
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:08,231
sometimes takes them to points, say for example
if they have to go by train.

212
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:11,551
So instead of arriving at the right station,
they'll go to the station which is further

213
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:13,551
on.

214
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:15,241
And then again they'll arrive at the further
on.

215
00:15:15,241 --> 00:15:17,771
The train will never reach them.

216
00:15:17,771 --> 00:15:21,391
Sort of temperament they have.

217
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:28,071
So one should not plan at all anything like
that, that fixes you.

218
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:33,021
But at this moment, if I have to be told that
we have to go at this time, is all right,

219
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:34,021
finished now.

220
00:15:34,021 --> 00:15:36,171
At this moment I've told, is recorded, finished.

221
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:37,171
All right?

222
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:39,611
So it's gone into the memory.

223
00:15:39,611 --> 00:15:41,281
There's nothing to worry about it now.

224
00:15:41,281 --> 00:15:43,761
Now, present moment, what are we doing?

225
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:47,611
In a very calm way, witness it.

226
00:15:47,611 --> 00:15:50,361
Witness yourself, now, witness yourself.

227
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:53,901
"Where is my mind going?"

228
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:59,371
Now somebody who has to cook must be thinking,
"Oh, I have to get this, I have to get that."

229
00:15:59,371 --> 00:16:04,401
Once you start saying that "I have to do it",
you'll never be able to do it that way.

230
00:16:04,401 --> 00:16:11,111
But you said, "All right, just now I'm in
meditation."

231
00:16:11,111 --> 00:16:14,711
Every moment, "I am in meditation."

232
00:16:14,711 --> 00:16:21,131
Everything will walk up to you, even matter,
and you'll get the right things at the right

233
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:23,701
place.

234
00:16:23,701 --> 00:16:28,260
You'll meet right people at the right place.

235
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,671
The other day we were just walking, strolling
around.

236
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:33,671
Whom do we find there?

237
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:34,671
Carolyn.

238
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:36,461
She just walked out.

239
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:40,921
There is she, I mean I met her.

240
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:42,820
She said, "Christine is just next door."

241
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,031
I said, "Let's go," and you should have seen
the joy on her face when she came down, and

242
00:16:47,031 --> 00:16:48,701
she saw Me.

243
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:53,221
Beautiful experience for Me and her, she was
so happy.

244
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,981
Then we went together.

245
00:16:55,981 --> 00:17:02,981
So when you have so much tied down with your
watch, that means you are not tied down with

246
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,351
your spirit.

247
00:17:05,351 --> 00:17:13,230
So a Sahaja yogi, if he sees watch, then he's
not a Sahaja yogi.

248
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,401
But the other side could be that the Sahaja
yogis are never in time where they have to

249
00:17:18,401 --> 00:17:20,021
be.

250
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:22,421
Very common in England.

251
00:17:22,421 --> 00:17:26,331
I reach always first, to open the door.

252
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:33,511
And to clean it also sometimes.

253
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:41,510
Now, to take for granted things, as you say,
take for granted, that's not the way Sahaja

254
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:42,510
Yoga is.

255
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,380
You have to be alert, alert, absolutely alert.

256
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,331
If you are alert, immediately you'll know
"I have to go now at this time.

257
00:17:49,331 --> 00:17:51,591
I have to do it.

258
00:17:51,591 --> 00:17:55,461
I have to get this thing now."

259
00:17:55,461 --> 00:17:59,221
If you have to miss something, you are supposed
to miss it.

260
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:00,771
That's what it is.

261
00:18:00,771 --> 00:18:06,010
So, there's a beautiful thing written down,
like they say, "Jai sei rakhahu tase hi rahun"

262
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:11,411
- "The way You keep me, the way I am, will
be happy."

263
00:18:11,411 --> 00:18:16,010
So, satisfaction towards yourself, your spirit,
is important.

264
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:24,051
Because ego will plan out, "Oh, we'll go there,
we must get for Mother, say, daisies", we

265
00:18:24,051 --> 00:18:25,051
decide.

266
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:26,051
"Must get daisies."

267
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:27,251
You don't find daisies, you're disappointed.

268
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:28,251
Why not?

269
00:18:28,251 --> 00:18:32,471
These are all My flowers, whether they are
daisies or not, they look so nice.

270
00:18:32,471 --> 00:18:36,021
Whatever you get, you get it.

271
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:37,921
That's the thing wanted.

272
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:44,171
You know that, that the Divine is working
out everything for you.

273
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:48,821
When you are supposed to get something else,
better have it.

274
00:18:48,821 --> 00:18:56,531
Even by mistake, if I lay My hand upon some
things, like a book or something, immediately

275
00:18:56,531 --> 00:19:00,841
I'll open it out and see why this book has
come in My attention; why this fellow has

276
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:05,120
come in My attention; why this is happening.

277
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,102
And immediately I find that there’s some
connection, something has to be done, something

278
00:19:11,102 --> 00:19:14,591
has to be said, something has to be worked
out.

279
00:19:14,591 --> 00:19:25,971
So for a person who is imbibed with the culture
of spirit, the Sahaj culture, impresses others

280
00:19:25,971 --> 00:19:30,051
by his calmness and relaxed attitude.

281
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:34,321
Relaxation never means lethargy, by any chance.

282
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:36,380
It doesn't mean lethargy.

283
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,331
Lethargy is against relaxation.

284
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:42,401
A person who is relaxed cannot become lethargic.

285
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:47,911
"Relaxed" means a person who’s alert and
calm.

286
00:19:47,911 --> 00:20:00,031
These two things for human beings is an impossibility,
because if they are alert, if they are alert

287
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:02,281
then they're not calm.

288
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:08,451
If they're unhappy, sad, then they think they
are very, very calm.

289
00:20:08,451 --> 00:20:13,231
So this is one of the things one has to remember,
that you have to witness yourself all the

290
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:15,141
time.

291
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:17,211
Not to condemn yourself, but witness.

292
00:20:17,211 --> 00:20:20,750
Now I said the word "witness" means "detached".

293
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:26,232
Now what happens with this, when you start
condemning yourself, you miss every good point.

294
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:37,721
For example, you have some experience of a
sudden height being achieved.

295
00:20:37,721 --> 00:20:39,130
All right?

296
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:46,041
At that point you should catch hold of it,
hold on to it, keep doing, but don't forget

297
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:49,820
that you may go back, no.

298
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,911
And then wait for another higher moment to
come, hold on to it.

299
00:20:53,911 --> 00:20:56,620
That's how you climb Himalayas.

300
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,951
But not that, "Oh Ma.

301
00:20:58,951 --> 00:21:02,421
Now it's all right, but what will happen next?"

302
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:09,711
Then you are gone down, because you have to
face yourself in the way, knowing what are

303
00:21:09,711 --> 00:21:10,711
your powers.

304
00:21:10,711 --> 00:21:15,351
You are a spirit now, you are no more an ordinary
human being, so you have no business to condemn

305
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:21,510
yourself, or to degrade yourself, or in any
way to feel unhappy.

306
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,521
No way.

307
00:21:22,521 --> 00:21:24,051
Past is past.

308
00:21:24,051 --> 00:21:26,591
What happened a moment before is finished.

309
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:27,591
"Now I am going to rise.

310
00:21:27,591 --> 00:21:32,971
Now I am going to rise."

311
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:45,301
So a person who has a Sahaja culture is not
only spontaneous, but is inspired, is a inspired

312
00:21:45,301 --> 00:21:47,291
personality.

313
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:57,931
A person who is of that kind, an inspired
visionary, then other people get impressed

314
00:21:57,931 --> 00:22:05,021
by such a person that, "See, there's a man
who's inspired, who talks in an inspired way,

315
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:09,531
in a way that is something very different
from others."

316
00:22:09,531 --> 00:22:15,571
Something new he says, new that is nourishing.

317
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:22,651
Such a personality - like the other day, you
see, we heard the lectures of so many people,

318
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:29,120
and when the New Zealand Prime Minister was
coming C.P. said, "Now let's go back, because

319
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,541
we'll have a little tea or something."

320
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:32,370
I said: "No, you listen to this man.

321
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,370
He's a realized soul."

322
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,370
He said, "Really?"

323
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,681
I said, "Yes, you listen to him."

324
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:39,641
First everybody was, "He's sitting in New
Zealand, such a little titwit of a country,

325
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:41,561
what is he going to speak?"

326
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:43,531
You see, they were moving about, making a…

327
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:48,321
Within two minutes he captured everybody's
attention, you see, and he was bubbling with

328
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:55,010
everything, so beautifully, and he spoke all
the points so much different, and so much

329
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,521
new and so much better.

330
00:22:56,521 --> 00:22:57,521
C.P. was amazed.

331
00:22:57,521 --> 00:22:59,231
He said, "How do You know?"

332
00:22:59,231 --> 00:23:04,481
I said, "I know, because when I was in New
Zealand I told them he's a realized soul."

333
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:08,620
And our own Prime Minister is also a realized
soul.

334
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,191
You'll be surprised, after our Prime Minister
finished his lecture and all that, after two

335
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:18,110
or three lectures he was to go; then he turned
round and went to this Australian [Shri Mataji

336
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:22,971
may have meant New Zealand] Prime Minister,
only him, went and congratulated him, congratulated

337
00:23:22,971 --> 00:23:23,971
him.

338
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:26,781
Congratulated and said something very close
to him.

339
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:30,471
And the fellow again, you see, flew up into
joy.

340
00:23:30,471 --> 00:23:32,250
We see it's all there.

341
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,151
And then he came away.

342
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:35,151
Why?

343
00:23:35,151 --> 00:23:40,261
Because one realized soul understands another
realized soul, and everybody was amazed: why

344
00:23:40,261 --> 00:23:44,401
did he turn to this man alone, and went and
congratulated him?

345
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:51,531
So such a large country like India represented
by our Prime Minister, goes down all the way

346
00:23:51,531 --> 00:23:57,221
to a little country like New Zealand which
is nothing compared to India, and congratulates.

347
00:23:57,221 --> 00:23:59,951
And that's a developed country, this is a
developing country.

348
00:23:59,951 --> 00:24:02,501
Is something people did not understand.

349
00:24:02,501 --> 00:24:06,151
And the whole joyous atmosphere both of them
shaking hands created.

350
00:24:06,151 --> 00:24:15,731
This is Sahaja culture, in which you recognize
a realized soul, the dignity of a realized

351
00:24:15,731 --> 00:24:17,001
soul.

352
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:23,221
So when it comes to relating to others, first
and foremost are Sahaja yogis.

353
00:24:23,221 --> 00:24:30,620
But I've seen most of the people are more
congenial with others, and less congenial

354
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,431
with Sahaja yogis.

355
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:39,781
They try to criticize Sahaja yogis all the
time, and I test them.

356
00:24:39,781 --> 00:24:41,151
I sometimes say, "All right.

357
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:44,481
I don't think this fellow is very good" and
all that.

358
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:48,821
But when the other person turns round and
shows compassion and says, "No, Mother, I

359
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:53,240
think it will work out" then I like it.

360
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,951
I like that.

361
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:58,291
Or else sometimes I say, "Oh, let them go
away.

362
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:01,591
There should be no more food for them, it's
all right."

363
00:25:01,591 --> 00:25:05,271
No, Mother, we've made food for them."

364
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:09,641
So the culture of Sahaj is to give.

365
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:15,931
Give, and give, and give, and never ask for
a reward.

366
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:18,380
Never thinks, "What I have to get".

367
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:25,061
After all, you have got the highest that anybody
could get.

368
00:25:25,061 --> 00:25:30,621
They said the three heights a human being
can achieve in spirituality, which you all

369
00:25:30,621 --> 00:25:32,891
got in no time.

370
00:25:32,891 --> 00:25:40,120
It's called as salokya, samipya, sanidya.

371
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:45,401
Salokya is that you should be able to see
God.

372
00:25:45,401 --> 00:25:49,051
That you got.

373
00:25:49,051 --> 00:25:56,231
Samipya is the closeness with God.

374
00:25:56,231 --> 00:26:01,311
Sanidya is the togetherness, togetherness.

375
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:09,481
You have got all these three.

376
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:12,990
In one incarnation you've got it.

377
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:26,251
When Gods incarnated before, nobody knew that
they were Gods.

378
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,971
So even they got it, they never knew.

379
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:35,721
Very few people knew about them.

380
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:45,051
But even when Christ said He was the Son of
God, who, how many believed Him?

381
00:26:45,051 --> 00:26:47,481
They crucified Him.

382
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:50,781
Because they were not realized souls.

383
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:56,431
But by giving you realization I have given
you that capacity to get all these three blessings

384
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:58,431
at one shot.

385
00:26:58,431 --> 00:27:03,391
I speak your language, I speak your style,
I live with your style, and you understand

386
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:04,391
Me.

387
00:27:04,391 --> 00:27:05,601
There is no problem.

388
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:11,161
But with other Gods, imagine if I were Mahakali
today, what would have happened.

389
00:27:11,161 --> 00:27:18,321
You would be all upside-down there hanging,
seeing Me from the other way round.

390
00:27:18,321 --> 00:27:22,801
I don't know what would have happened - or
any one of them.

391
00:27:22,801 --> 00:27:33,510
So the three blessings that a saint is promised,
you've got all of them.

392
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:40,011
But because you've got them, you don't understand.

393
00:27:40,011 --> 00:27:41,490
You take it for granted.

394
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:44,500
There's no shraddha.

395
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:53,211
With this experience there should be tremendous
faith.

396
00:27:53,211 --> 00:28:01,120
Faith is a thing that resides between Me and
you, in between.

397
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,241
Is we can say, the ocean of joy that is in
between.

398
00:28:05,241 --> 00:28:17,500
Whatever I emit to you is that shraddha, and
when you are drenched into it, the joy of

399
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:26,391
that shraddha makes everything so sahaj.

400
00:28:26,391 --> 00:28:33,421
But for that you must open your hearts.

401
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:43,141
A Sahaja yogi who is secretive, who is insular,
who is jealous, who separates himself from

402
00:28:43,141 --> 00:28:46,120
others is no good.

403
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,171
Open your heart.

404
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:55,271
Give away your things, doesn't matter.

405
00:28:55,271 --> 00:29:01,740
Matter has only one value, that it can communicate
your Sahaj culture.

406
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:16,821
Little things, you see, I see something that
you have got beautiful, and in My Mahamaya

407
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:21,181
acting on Myself I say, "Oh, that's very beautiful."

408
00:29:21,181 --> 00:29:30,221
and then they say, "Mother, You gave us this."

409
00:29:30,221 --> 00:29:33,091
"Ah, sorry."

410
00:29:33,091 --> 00:29:38,471
And then I feel very ashamed of Myself, that
this is not Sahaj culture, you see.

411
00:29:38,471 --> 00:29:42,271
But the joy is so much that I can't help it
sometimes I say, "Oh, I - it's so beautiful,

412
00:29:42,271 --> 00:29:43,531
this one."

413
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:47,671
"You gave us, Mother."

414
00:29:47,671 --> 00:29:52,711
And the whole rapport and the whole feeling;
I feeling a little shy about it, and all,

415
00:29:52,711 --> 00:30:00,041
they're so beautiful, so dramatic; so dramatic
it is, so poetic.

416
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:03,321
Only at that point I feel ashamed of Myself.

417
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:09,891
Of course to be human being you should be
ashamed of yourself sometimes.

418
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,281
Otherwise the drama is not complete.

419
00:30:11,281 --> 00:30:17,941
So the whole thing is so beautiful and so
joyous.

420
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:23,051
But that gentleness towards others and yourself
should be there.

421
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:29,271
Now if you become unhappy and serious, you
are very unkind to yourself and to others.

422
00:30:29,271 --> 00:30:35,161
Anybody who is a serious person, sits with
a serious face, know that he is not a Sahaja

423
00:30:35,161 --> 00:30:36,721
yogi at all.

424
00:30:36,721 --> 00:30:40,110
They should be bubbling with laughter, joy
all the time.

425
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:45,271
I cannot be serious for more than, I think,
five seconds perhaps.

426
00:30:45,271 --> 00:30:47,681
I don't know.

427
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:52,081
I try, because lectures should be serious
to go into the hearts of the people.

428
00:30:52,081 --> 00:30:58,951
But there's not, and you can see that even
when I'm getting angry, My eyes betray Me,

429
00:30:58,951 --> 00:31:04,611
and there's a twinkle of laughter in the eyes.

430
00:31:04,611 --> 00:31:10,031
That's how a person should be, and don't worry
what others have to say.

431
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:16,380
You see, the culture where people are just
glum like this, is the same as the people

432
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,801
where they are frivolous.

433
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:26,380
Now as we can say American culture is to be
frivolous, stupid, you see, I won't be surprised

434
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,621
supposing your Prime Minister tomorrow starts
wearing a sari, just to amuse you.

435
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:38,260
Anything is possible with them, just to amuse
you, you see, too - for cheap popularity.

436
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,401
Anything frivolous, stupid, they will do.

437
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:47,941
But supposing, you see, it is say an English
old conservative personality, then a lady

438
00:31:47,941 --> 00:31:56,821
might wear a very official dress with the
lines and this and that, and like a man she

439
00:31:56,821 --> 00:32:02,471
might become very soon, like that, develop
a very serious face.

440
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:06,281
But both things are nonsensical, has no meaning.

441
00:32:06,281 --> 00:32:13,831
You have to be natural, and natural everything
is always bubbling with joy.

442
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:15,561
And a message.

443
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:16,561
And a message.

444
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:24,421
These flowers are the message of My coming,
writ large on them.

445
00:32:24,421 --> 00:32:31,651
So a person who is a Sahaj culture man should
emit that message to others, people should

446
00:32:31,651 --> 00:32:33,490
see, "Oh, this is the man.

447
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:36,021
He is the sahaja fellow."

448
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:37,021
You can see that clearly.

449
00:32:37,021 --> 00:32:38,571
There's no seriousness, there's no unhappiness,
nothing.

450
00:32:38,571 --> 00:32:44,651
Supposing I have said something that might
be upsetting you, forget it.

451
00:32:44,651 --> 00:32:51,031
If you cannot forget that, then you have not
listened to Me.

452
00:32:51,031 --> 00:32:53,961
But "forget" doesn't mean that you do not
act upon it.

453
00:32:53,961 --> 00:32:59,870
"Acting upon it" means that you face yourself
and see for yourself how you have ascended

454
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,071
and how far you have to go, not how you'll
fall down.

455
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:08,831
So it is all the time acting on both sides,
as I'm telling you in My lecture, that on

456
00:33:08,831 --> 00:33:15,141
one side you'll see to yourself as relationship
with Me, and relationship with others.

457
00:33:15,141 --> 00:33:28,761
For a Sahaja yogi it should not matter whether
you are in a palace or on the street.

458
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:32,750
The first encounter with the first Sahaja
yogis - we have only one surviving, now here

459
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:40,260
sitting down - they couldn't bear, for them
it was difficult to be in the beautiful atmosphere

460
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,260
of India.

461
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:47,211
The reason is, they were analyzing: they have
no good bathrooms, no showers.

462
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:50,610
But you have the whole sky.

463
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:53,250
You have all the mountains.

464
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:54,570
You have all the trees.

465
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,580
You have got all the waters flowing.

466
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:04,330
But you want to have a little shower, in which
you can't even move.

467
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:11,010
Just an idea, just an idea of comfort.

468
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:16,931
You have no comforts, if you ask Me, compared
to what we have in India.

469
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:18,560
No comforts at all.

470
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,680
I mean, ask any Indian girl to come and stay,
she will cry.

471
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:30,670
Even I think here the President, the President
has to wash his utensils perhaps, maybe.

472
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,831
What a comfort.

473
00:34:32,831 --> 00:34:36,450
There's no division of labor.

474
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:41,151
Now in our country we have servants, but "servants"
doesn't mean that we cheat them anything else.

475
00:34:41,151 --> 00:34:43,770
They eat the same food as we eat.

476
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,651
They live the same way we live.

477
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:49,631
But they do different type of work, because
they don't have the same mental capacity to

478
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:51,891
be the President.

479
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:56,520
The President does some other work.

480
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,891
You have no comfort of any kind, you take
it from Me.

481
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:02,941
Food matter, you get everything processed
food.

482
00:35:02,941 --> 00:35:07,940
Imagine, any time you might be developing
cancer due to processed food.

483
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,550
What is your speciality then?

484
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,290
Try to understand.

485
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:17,451
What is the kind of food: it's not fresh,
God knows how it is processed, how it is preserved,

486
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:18,540
from where it is coming.

487
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:24,631
Suddenly in London they said that, "Don't
eat this kind of food," you see, "because

488
00:35:24,631 --> 00:35:26,980
it has got something contaminated."

489
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,371
So everybody rushes, you see, to the store
room, because we have to store up all these

490
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:32,371
things.

491
00:35:32,371 --> 00:35:33,371
You can't get at the right….

492
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:36,891
"Oh it's there"; then you start throwing them
out.

493
00:35:36,891 --> 00:35:46,931
It's a mad racing because people think that,
"God knows what we are eating today, is it

494
00:35:46,931 --> 00:35:48,121
correct or not?"

495
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:51,960
So food-wise you are zero.

496
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:58,941
Best thing is to live in the villages or in
the forests, to get the fresh fruits, wash

497
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:08,980
them in clean flowing water of a river, eat
it nicely and sit down enjoying the sun.

498
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:15,871
The comfort of the spirit is the thing we
have lost, and those who seek the comfort

499
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:21,800
of the spirit are Sahaja yogis, not otherwise.

500
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:25,700
Comfort of the spirit comes in giving.

501
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:32,980
Say I've borrowed some money from you, I won't
be comfortable till I've paid you back.

502
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:39,510
Going further with it, supposing you are caught
up into something, you have got some problems.

503
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:44,181
I'll somehow or other manage that you'll come
close to Me somewhere, and work it out on

504
00:36:44,181 --> 00:36:45,891
you, clear you out, finished.

505
00:36:45,891 --> 00:36:50,950
Till then I won't be comfortable; though I'll
suffer, I'll have pains, I'll have this, that.

506
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:54,750
As soon as I came here, left Nabhi was like
this going on.

507
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,750
Corrected it.

508
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:59,091
I took it upon Myself, I sucked it into Me.

509
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:02,381
So they are adventurous.

510
00:37:02,381 --> 00:37:07,780
"Oh I will not touch, I am catching, he's
catching."

511
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,780
Finished.

512
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:13,371
But now the compassion can only work out if
you have that kind of a spirit, otherwise

513
00:37:13,371 --> 00:37:14,520
you cannot.

514
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,240
It becomes sympathy.

515
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,861
For example there's one person, Mr. A. or
Miss A. or Mrs. A., whatever it is.

516
00:37:21,861 --> 00:37:27,290
I mean, I'm just talking of a common personality,
and that person is catching.

517
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:31,251
I would say in an ashram, that person should
clear out.

518
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:36,550
But all the ashramites will catch from that
person, and that person will never be all

519
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,820
right.

520
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,661
There's a very nice joke about it.

521
00:37:40,661 --> 00:37:44,141
There was a lady, she wanted to reduce herself.

522
00:37:44,141 --> 00:37:46,480
So there was a machine like a rolling-pin.

523
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,550
They said, "If you rub it, then you will reduce."

524
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:55,300
So she brought, poor thing, she brought the
machine and she started rolling it.

525
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:06,160
She found that the rolling-pin became fat,
instead of she reducing.

526
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,510
Same thing is in Sahaja yoga.

527
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,770
Instead of Sahaja yogis correcting the others,
they get contaminated.

528
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,611
That's why I said, "Don't have anybody in
the ashram."

529
00:38:15,611 --> 00:38:19,300
Because you sympathize.

530
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:24,480
You do not try to correct that person, in
a way that you can correct within yourselves,

531
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,940
suck it within yourself as your Mother does,
and do it.

532
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:32,111
I do it for thousands and thousands and thousands;
you have to do it for one or two, so you are

533
00:38:32,111 --> 00:38:33,111
never bothered.

534
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:34,720
And that's how you become strong.

535
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,160
Not by shunning them, running away from them
or condemning yourself, or saying that: "We

536
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,480
must save ourselves on the boat."

537
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
No.

538
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,941
Through adventure.

539
00:38:45,941 --> 00:38:47,831
"Let's see what happens".

540
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:50,680
Tamara was telling Me, "Nothing catches me,
Mother, what is it?"

541
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,310
I said: "But who will catch you?

542
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:59,000
Those who will catch will be hurt themselves."

543
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,481
So what is it, that Bhairava is to be established.

544
00:39:02,481 --> 00:39:09,201
Sidha kala mane Bhairav' - as you have to
establish Shri Ganesha, you have to establish

545
00:39:09,201 --> 00:39:11,960
also Bhairava, and Hanumana on the right side.

546
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,891
If these three deities you establish within
yourself, nothing, nothing on this earth can

547
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:18,891
catch you.

548
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:22,451
You'll catch it for a while.

549
00:39:22,451 --> 00:39:26,160
But what I find now, I came to this ashram,
everybody's left Nabhi caught up.

550
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,700
Everybody's left Agnya caught up.

551
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,240
So then I get the pain.

552
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,240
Everyone.

553
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:36,101
I mean, I have put you inside My body, do
you know that?

554
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:41,810
You are part and parcel of My body, you are
the cells in My body.

555
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:50,690
And when you catch, I also catch; not catch,
but I really get the pain, but I clear it.

556
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:53,621
In the same way, I have given you powers.

557
00:39:53,621 --> 00:40:01,141
Every power I have, I have given you.

558
00:40:01,141 --> 00:40:08,540
But you have to develop it and you have to
be adventurous.

559
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:13,900
But on the contrary, once we have ashrams,
everybody settles down, "Oh, now, very comfortable,

560
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,900
very cheap."

561
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,081
Very economical, that's the first comfort.

562
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:28,591
It's surprising, for a Western person, it
is very important that it should be economical,

563
00:40:28,591 --> 00:40:36,960
surprising, affluent people think more of
saving money than the people who are poor.

564
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:46,210
And English are the last word, save pounds,
at the cost of others.

565
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:49,891
On the contrary if you go to India, where
they’ll be very happy, they'll invite you

566
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:51,131
in their house.

567
00:40:51,131 --> 00:40:54,730
Whatever they have they will give it to you,
"Eat, eat, eat."

568
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:55,730
They'll force you.

569
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:57,480
They'll be very happy to give.

570
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,081
But in England it's very dangerous, you see.

571
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:04,500
Sometimes in the ashram they may not even
have food for Me.

572
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,190
Really.

573
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,930
And if you tell them, "I know.

574
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:09,930
I know."

575
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:10,930
You know.

576
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:11,930
Finished.

577
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:12,930
Then what do you say?

578
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,480
They already know it, now what to do?

579
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,611
They know.

580
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:23,780
So with the affluence miserliness grows, and
money-orientation.

581
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:29,200
In India also I've seen people who get little
more money than the rest become very money-oriented.

582
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,070
Money becomes everything, money becomes the
power, money becomes their life.

583
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,871
Sahaja yogi doesn't care for money.

584
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:42,960
Just.. is the dust of our Mother's feet.

585
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,921
What is money, what is wealth?

586
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:51,201
And when they do like that, then their money
problems are solved.

587
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:54,150
If you have a money problem, know that there's
a problem.

588
00:41:54,150 --> 00:42:00,180
If you are very particular about money.

589
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,800
I am, in a way, because if I have to give
somebody, I remember it.

590
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,780
But I've seen people who are very anxious
to tell Me that, "You have to pay this man

591
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,780
so much, that man so much."

592
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,780
That's wrong.

593
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,121
That's not your look-out.

594
00:42:13,121 --> 00:42:18,320
That's very, very wrong to tell Me that, "You
have to pay this man or that man."

595
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,181
It's not important.

596
00:42:20,181 --> 00:42:23,930
Even if I don't pay, I pay him.

597
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:29,851
So in relationship with Me, you are not to
tell Me that, "You have to pay so much money

598
00:42:29,851 --> 00:42:33,911
to him, this much money should be paid, this
is what he owes You."

599
00:42:33,911 --> 00:42:34,990
Nothing of the kind.

600
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:37,510
Let the person come and tell Me.

601
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,861
Why are you telling?

602
00:42:38,861 --> 00:42:43,520
That kind of a message if you give Me, you
are lost.

603
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,911
Or if you come and tell Me for somebody else
that, "Mother, time is up, we have to go.

604
00:42:48,911 --> 00:42:51,160
Somebody is hurrying You up."

605
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:57,520
If somebody is hurrying Me, tell him, "Don't
hurry Mother."

606
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:09,550
You must know that your kundalinis were not
raised with just your own kundalini, but something

607
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,320
that is working it out.

608
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:16,181
Something very tremendous, a big organization.

609
00:43:16,181 --> 00:43:20,070
You can't see it, it is microscopic.

610
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:24,250
You must know, nobody got realization like
that, did they?

611
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,450
Thousands getting realization, what's happening?

612
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,820
There must be something about…

613
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:34,040
Now how can you tell anything to such an organization?

614
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,040
They don't like it.

615
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,460
They know it.

616
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:40,471
Actually they are the ones who know, not the
English.

617
00:43:40,471 --> 00:43:43,470
They know what is to be done.

618
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:50,300
So your relationship with Me acts as your
culture.

619
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:56,750
So it is a Mother's cult, you can call it,
the Mother's culture.

620
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:59,412
How we are connected with our Mother.

621
00:43:59,412 --> 00:44:06,210
I have seen people, if somebody is rude to
them, they get very angry.

622
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:09,621
But if somebody is rude to Me they don't feel
angry.

623
00:44:09,621 --> 00:44:13,671
It should be the other way round.

624
00:44:13,671 --> 00:44:16,831
Now I'll give you an example.

625
00:44:16,831 --> 00:44:23,230
This Merv Griffin was funny, and both our
PRO’s were very angry.

626
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:24,930
It was natural and very…

627
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:28,070
I mean, I liked it, but I calmed them down.

628
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:30,220
And Worlikar of course was on top of this
thing.

629
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:33,191
But the other fellow would not.

630
00:44:33,191 --> 00:44:36,460
He was giving arguments.

631
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,990
I was just watching.

632
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:41,621
I mean, if somebody had said this to his mother...

633
00:44:41,621 --> 00:44:49,671
There's another one there, he never came to
receive Me at the airport.

634
00:44:49,671 --> 00:45:00,050
So Worlikar said, "If your own mother had
come, you would not have gone?"

635
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:03,970
Then one can give explanation, "Oh, but our
Mother is Adi Shakti.

636
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:06,190
My mother is not, she's helpless."

637
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:07,190
It's not.

638
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:12,331
To show your respect, to show your love, you
have to go; for your own gain, not for Her

639
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:13,331
gain.

640
00:45:13,331 --> 00:45:17,000
For your own gain.

641
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,641
This relationship is for your own gain.

642
00:45:20,641 --> 00:45:30,260
Supposing if you strike oil, is it for your
gain or for the gain of the oil?

643
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:36,820
If you get to the Source, is it for the Source
to gain anything, or it is for you to gain

644
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,820
anything?

645
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,601
Logic, simple logic.

646
00:45:40,601 --> 00:45:49,760
So in that culture, you see, you really thrive
and you become extremely a happy person, a

647
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,280
joyous person.

648
00:45:52,280 --> 00:46:01,621
And the expression of such a person is so
different, because such a person, as I told

649
00:46:01,621 --> 00:46:08,400
you, rises above and sees the problems of
others, the decadence of the society, sees

650
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,710
all the problems of the world.

651
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:17,451
Not only that, but knows the solutions.

652
00:46:17,451 --> 00:46:27,260
We are not like these ordinary people who
have racialism, this.. other diseases, I don't

653
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,211
know what sort of diseases they have, I also
forget.

654
00:46:30,211 --> 00:46:32,941
Racialism now, it's another stupid nonsense,
you know.

655
00:46:32,941 --> 00:46:34,480
What is racialism?

656
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:40,050
God has made somebody's color like this and
somebody's color like that, and those same

657
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:51,601
racists are trying to tan their faces.

658
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:58,530
So in this culture of ours we are not bothered
about superficial things.

659
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:07,510
What we are bothered about is our inner cleanliness,
inner beauty, but that doesn't mean that you

660
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:13,310
should move about like primitive people, no.

661
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:16,331
But if there is inner beauty, then outer beauty
comes.

662
00:47:16,331 --> 00:47:18,910
You will never find Me dirtily dressed.

663
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:24,530
You will never find Me without a sari on,
even when I sleep I wear a sari, because in

664
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:35,611
the night also I have to work, so how can
I go in My dressing-gown to the other world?

665
00:47:35,611 --> 00:47:42,810
So a person who is a Sahaja yogi has to be
an extremely neat and a clean person, but

666
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:46,440
not to tell others, but should be himself
or herself.

667
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:51,220
That's one of the things are very important,
because others will see you, like loonies,

668
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,570
who's going to believe you?

669
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:59,780
So the one effect is from the Mother, you
take from the Source, for what?

670
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:08,631
To be that illuminated quality, in you, so
that others see you as something great and

671
00:48:08,631 --> 00:48:12,680
adore you, worship you.

672
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:17,770
This is this far we have come, now, how your
personality should be.

673
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:23,710
But now, when you are dealing with others,
know that they are human beings made by God,

674
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:28,800
not by Sahaja yogis by any chance.

675
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,651
And they will be tomorrow's Sahaja yogis,
may be higher Sahaja yogis than you.

676
00:48:33,651 --> 00:48:40,500
So when we are dealing with others also, talk
to them in a gentle way.

677
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,520
Be kind to them.

678
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:45,391
Of course we are against gurus, against cults,
against all these people.

679
00:48:45,391 --> 00:48:52,930
But as soon as they come, if you say: "Oh,
you are a bhoot", the person will do right-about-turn

680
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:56,820
and go away.

681
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:07,601
So you are not given this power to be abrupt
or to be arrogant with others, not given.

682
00:49:07,601 --> 00:49:15,310
Now all such people are coming down, calming
down because they see that what helps is your

683
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:20,081
gentle, kindly, firm attitude.

684
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:23,060
Only after Sahaja Yoga you can combine all
these qualities.

685
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:32,010
You'll be firm, you'll be alert, you'll be
gentle and compassionate, smiling, but not

686
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,810
making fun of others.

687
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:43,810
So then you become a personality who is alert:
to see what is the reaction they're having

688
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,770
on others, this is very important to be seen.

689
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:50,140
So now you start witnessing others.

690
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:52,290
What is your reaction on others?

691
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:57,910
I have seen many a times, a new Sahaja yogi
comes in.

692
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:04,980
The person is trying to say something, and
the girl starts giggling or laughing.

693
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:09,871
One should not, at that time, because the
person might think that, "They're making fool

694
00:50:09,871 --> 00:50:15,101
of me, or they're thinking that I'm a stupid
person, or something wrong with me."

695
00:50:15,101 --> 00:50:18,900
That person will become self-conscious, I
won't be able to give realization to that

696
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,060
person.

697
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:27,050
But if somebody is sitting before Me and I'm
trying to help that person, know that it's

698
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:33,560
a very important moment of this gentleman's
life.

699
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,621
We have got it, so what?

700
00:50:35,621 --> 00:50:42,710
When we are pulling out somebody, when we
are helping out somebody, do we laugh?

701
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:51,621
That's the time you have to be very concerned
and very much serious, to do the job.

702
00:50:51,621 --> 00:50:57,030
Every quality and mood has its own place,
like nose is at its own place, eyes at its

703
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:58,030
own place.

704
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:07,730
In the same way, all these moods that we have,
have their own places.

705
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:13,430
And that is what is lost in modern society.

706
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:20,550
So when I am trying to help somebody, you
should be all concern about that person.

707
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:24,230
How does this come in to us from the Source?

708
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:27,361
How much you are concerned about Me?

709
00:51:27,361 --> 00:51:33,900
Supposing I am thirsty, you will feel thirsty.

710
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,601
You'll immediately say, "Mother, I'll get
You some water."

711
00:51:36,601 --> 00:51:40,670
But you may not even ask Me, just bring it
here, keep it there.

712
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:43,631
Or just make some tea for Me or look after
Me.

713
00:51:43,631 --> 00:51:47,040
Do this or do that.

714
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,220
In little, little things you should watch.

715
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:53,861
The concern is not in saying something, asking
something.

716
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,331
You don't ask.

717
00:51:55,331 --> 00:52:04,700
Don't ask Mother, you just do it.

718
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:09,060
That's how, when you start doing it, you will
understand what you are doing to others.

719
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:16,852
So the reflection on others, how they reflect
about you also is very important, and you

720
00:52:16,852 --> 00:52:20,900
have to be alert.

721
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,940
Suddenly you say something, and everybody
disappears.

722
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,911
You must know they are not yet Sahaja yogis,
they are to be brought in, so you have to

723
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:34,241
very carefully bring them around.

724
00:52:34,241 --> 00:52:41,260
Then with Sahaja yogis, among yourselves how
you behave is extremely important for others

725
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,220
to see.

726
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:51,111
We must cherish each other's company, we must
cherish.

727
00:52:51,111 --> 00:52:55,901
To meet some Sahaja yogi somewhere, "Ah, what
a joy it is to see someone, to talk to someone

728
00:52:55,901 --> 00:52:57,180
on the phone."

729
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:04,351
But because we are so insular, so selfish,
so greedy, and sometimes very circumcised

730
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:13,230
[should read 'circumscribed'] I should say,
or absolutely engulfed into our past, we cannot

731
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:19,930
do that, we do not feel that joy, we cannot
adore another Sahaja yogi, we do not enjoy

732
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:25,520
another Sahaja yogi, we cannot cherish his
company.

733
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:30,290
That means this finger cannot feel this finger.

734
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:35,241
It's like a developing, what you call, a disease
called leprosy.

735
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:37,851
Nerves are finished.

736
00:53:37,851 --> 00:53:40,240
Nerve endings are not there.

737
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:49,190
You cannot feel the joy of other Sahaja yogis.

738
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:56,111
And this is only possible if you get over
your personal interests.

739
00:53:56,111 --> 00:54:04,310
When people come in Sahaja Yoga in the beginning,
they have personal interests, like say somebody

740
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:11,540
is trying to sell something, so they would
like to sell it to Sahaja yogis.

741
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:16,131
Or they are arranging something, they would
like Sahaja yogis to do it.

742
00:54:16,131 --> 00:54:20,081
See, personal interest, to use Sahaja yogis
for their own purposes.

743
00:54:20,081 --> 00:54:28,950
As a result of that I've seen some people
become so insular that nobody helps them,

744
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:33,270
no work is done by them; if there's a telephone,
nobody will say, "I'll get it."

745
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,060
That's American quality, they'll say, "I'll
get it."

746
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:37,831
Is regarded good.

747
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:44,500
Not in England, they'll be all sitting, quiet.

748
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:49,690
Even when they have eaten the food, they have
to pay the money, they'll look this side,

749
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:54,190
and some poor Indian student will pay for
all of them.

750
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,730
"I won't look", they say.

751
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:56,730
"Now paid."

752
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,010
Now they are normal.

753
00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:02,200
It's very low-level.

754
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:07,800
Is extremely low-level behavior.

755
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:19,510
And this is what one has to learn, that you
have to cherish others, give presents to others.

756
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:28,500
"You're going there; “Oh, now…"; like
the other day I met a lady, she had liked

757
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:33,210
one of My rings of emerald.

758
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:39,670
That's My family ring so I can't give away,
you see, I'll have to ask C.P. and he may

759
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:44,550
not like it, because after all I have no right
on it, I have to give it to My children, all

760
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,550
right?

761
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:49,640
But I found an emerald somewhere, beautiful,
so I kept it with Me.

762
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,800
The other day when I gave her, she was so
enamored.

763
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,630
I said, "You liked My ring, I couldn't give
you My ring, so.."

764
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:59,150
She said to Me, "You mean to say, I would
have taken Your ring?"

765
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:03,460
I said, "I would have forced it on you, but
I couldn't give you, so I thought of it.

766
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,331
I just saw it somewhere so I got it for you."

767
00:56:06,331 --> 00:56:07,331
She said, "How thoughtful."

768
00:56:07,331 --> 00:56:10,660
But it's all in My head.

769
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:20,170
I, whenever I get it, a chance, you see, so
somebody says, "Oh, I like it", keep it in

770
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:21,170
mind.

771
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:24,160
Next time, even a flower.

772
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:29,050
You must cherish their companies, because
it's such a great thing to have somebody who

773
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:32,341
understands you, your spirit, and they have
the spirit.

774
00:56:32,341 --> 00:56:34,081
Such a great thing.

775
00:56:34,081 --> 00:56:39,280
How can you be unkind to each other?

776
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,460
That hurts Me the most of all.

777
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:50,941
And the first thing and the foremost thing
you have to give Me is congenial, beautiful,

778
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:59,331
loving group, that they love each other.

779
00:56:59,331 --> 00:57:03,650
If that's achieved, that you really love,
beyond your personal considerations.

780
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:11,180
I mean, of course, in Sahaja Yoga there are
now not many people who try to make money,

781
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:13,310
but try to make comfort for themselves.

782
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:16,770
They must have the best room, they must have
the best place, they must have...

783
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:19,871
"I didn't get this, I should have it, this,
that."

784
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,240
Try to do more than others.

785
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:27,431
I know sometimes people take advantage of
you, but they will go out of Sahaja Yoga very

786
00:57:27,431 --> 00:57:28,431
soon.

787
00:57:28,431 --> 00:57:32,871
So be sure that you become generous about
it, very generous.

788
00:57:32,871 --> 00:57:44,331
And generosity should start from your own
Sahaja yogi brothers and sisters.

789
00:57:44,331 --> 00:57:53,680
In the culture of Sahaja Yoga we have to have
a full imbibement bubbling through our nerves,

790
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,581
the sense of chastity.

791
00:57:57,581 --> 00:58:03,250
That is a must, whether you like it or not.

792
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:15,091
There should be no bad intentions about any
other person, of relationships which are not

793
00:58:15,091 --> 00:58:16,091
pure.

794
00:58:16,091 --> 00:58:28,510
Absolutely pure relationships, pure eyes without
any adultery, adulteration I would call it.

795
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:38,091
Clean eyes is the basic of Sahaja Yoga.

796
00:58:38,091 --> 00:58:44,940
Steadfast clean eyes, because your eyes are
very powerful.

797
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:50,440
You don't know how powerful they are.

798
00:58:50,440 --> 00:59:02,121
So to make it that way, to practice, move
your attention inward and towards the Sahasrara.

799
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:03,121
You can.

800
00:59:03,121 --> 00:59:07,670
With your eyes you suck in.

801
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:15,000
Even by looking at Me with the shraddha, with
the joy, you just suck it inside, My image.

802
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:22,871
Put it on your Sahasrara, put it in your heart,
you can do it.

803
00:59:22,871 --> 00:59:25,170
It's very joy giving.

804
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:30,960
When you put it in the Sahasrara, then you
get the knowledge.

805
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:38,150
When you put it in your heart, you get the
joy; and when you put it on your liver, then

806
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:43,500
you get the power of action.

807
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:49,740
From the photograph also you can do it, suck
in, move it.

808
00:59:49,740 --> 01:00:00,700
But that is shown in the way you behave towards
others, completely confident, gentle; no arrogance.

809
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:13,420
Neither the neck up like that or like that,
but in the center in a very dignified manner.

810
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:27,770
So in the culture of Sahaj, because the spirit
is the dignity, is the majesty, is the glory

811
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:31,470
of God, you have to judge yourself.

812
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:37,780
"Did I say something which is not respecting
my spirit?

813
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:44,660
Did I do something that is not glorious?"

814
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:48,940
Like I've seen people, when I'm there, they'll
go on asking Me hundred questions.

815
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,980
"Should it be white towel?

816
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:51,980
Green towel?

817
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:56,790
Should I do this, should I do that?"

818
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:58,190
Why?

819
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:00,430
Because we don't live with choices.

820
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:05,490
We live with whatever we get it, and there
is dignity in that.

821
01:01:05,490 --> 01:01:11,920
If you start doing choices, it's stupid.

822
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,671
In a group of Sahaja yogis, the food, "What
will you have?"

823
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:20,790
They'll take forty-five minutes to decide,
if you go in a restaurant, because the first,

824
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:25,570
the consciousness, "We are paying for it",
and somebody will have this, somebody will

825
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:26,570
have that.

826
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:28,910
The poor waiter will run away.

827
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:32,081
But why should we have different?

828
01:01:32,081 --> 01:01:36,391
It's just the same.

829
01:01:36,391 --> 01:01:43,800
Whatever Mother is having we'll have, finished.

830
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:47,150
But if not that, at least whatever everybody
is having, "Why have separately?"

831
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:51,601
Choices are not there in Sahaja Yoga, remember
this word very clearly.

832
01:01:51,601 --> 01:01:55,351
Choices of this, choices of that, I don't
like it, I like that.

833
01:01:55,351 --> 01:02:00,121
This is not good, that is not good.

834
01:02:00,121 --> 01:02:08,240
Because we need everything on the level of
vibrations, then the choice is coming.

835
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:18,000
Like, if the vibrations are not good we'll
not say it, but we'll not have it.

836
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:23,010
But not question of whether green or red or
yellow or white.

837
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:26,891
And that is what they are making fool out
of you.

838
01:02:26,891 --> 01:02:32,530
They will put one name, Cartier, finished.

839
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:36,060
People will pay any amount for that Cartier.

840
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:41,410
Is any ordinary stuff, it is nothing special.

841
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:43,510
But you see that ego, "I've got the Cartier.

842
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:48,780
I paid more to show that I've paid more, that
I've been a fool."

843
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:56,910
To pay more for something that's so cheapish;
that's what they're playing upon - remember

844
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:57,910
that.

845
01:02:57,910 --> 01:03:06,040
So you have to understand that when you are
a Sahaj personality, you have your own dignity.

846
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:09,431
These things do not give dignity to you.

847
01:03:09,431 --> 01:03:15,871
You give them dignity.

848
01:03:15,871 --> 01:03:24,820
But that doesn't mean tomorrow you come like
a clown, or like a limbo on your nose.

849
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:30,341
Of course I must see the other point always,
because it just slips out that side.

850
01:03:30,341 --> 01:03:37,701
When you become dignified, you will wear always
something that is dignified.

851
01:03:37,701 --> 01:03:39,490
You will do all that is dignified.

852
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:42,151
Is automatically you become dignified.

853
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:45,540
It's nothing artificial.

854
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:53,160
So dignity that comes, as you see your Mother.

855
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:59,490
Whatever you give Me in Puja I take it, all
right, but otherwise you cannot give Me anything

856
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:00,490
else.

857
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:06,730
If you give Me, I'll return it, somehow.

858
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:09,940
Somehow I'll return it.

859
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:16,371
A person who is money-oriented cannot have
dignity, because you see him like a beggar.

860
01:04:16,371 --> 01:04:19,491
See, if there’s money-orientation is too
much, he comes down to that level, you can

861
01:04:19,491 --> 01:04:21,961
see it, there cannot be dignity there.

862
01:04:21,961 --> 01:04:26,460
A man who is power-oriented is an idiot.

863
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:29,151
He looks like an idiot.

864
01:04:29,151 --> 01:04:30,620
So we cannot become idiots.

865
01:04:30,620 --> 01:04:31,620
All right.

866
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:34,230
So we cannot be power-oriented.

867
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:42,421
The one who is sort of a romantic or a love-oriented,
is a stupid fellow.

868
01:04:42,421 --> 01:04:44,710
He behaves like a stupid fellow.

869
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:48,050
On the street they go on kissing each other
all the time.

870
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,611
"Where are you going?"

871
01:04:49,611 --> 01:04:56,530
"To the divorce case, but last bit we are
thinking of having some kisses."

872
01:04:56,530 --> 01:05:00,421
Self-respect is the thing.

873
01:05:00,421 --> 01:05:01,820
Self is your spirit.

874
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:05,040
The respect of the spirit should give you
that dignity.

875
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:11,160
But in privacy you are gentle with your husband,
you are gentle with your wife.

876
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:18,400
You must learn how to be gentle with her in
privacy, not in public.

877
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,120
That's horrible.

878
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,280
Specially in India.

879
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,101
I am told that people go round with that romanticism
and all that.

880
01:05:25,101 --> 01:05:31,440
So please, don't do all those romantic stuff
in India, it's very embarrassing for Me, very

881
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,591
embarrassing.

882
01:05:32,591 --> 01:05:37,591
So we cannot do things which embarrasses our
Mother.

883
01:05:37,591 --> 01:05:42,370
Once you start knowing that, "This will embarrass
Mother, we can't do this", automatically you

884
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:43,370
are helping.

885
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:49,851
So when it is related with Me, immediately,
"What will Mother think of in me?

886
01:05:49,851 --> 01:05:51,970
Is this the way to behave towards Mother?"

887
01:05:51,970 --> 01:06:03,720
Immediately you will get the reward, as that
thing working through you, as if you become

888
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,841
that nature.

889
01:06:04,841 --> 01:06:08,240
Sahaja culture is a sahaja nature.

890
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,390
Automatically you will do it.

891
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:18,361
You'll talk in that manner, you will speak
in that manner, you’ll live in that manner.

892
01:06:18,361 --> 01:06:24,641
I mean, I have seen people who have never
known Me, on a trunk call or a telephone,

893
01:06:24,641 --> 01:06:25,841
they recognize.

894
01:06:25,841 --> 01:06:30,670
They know I am something special; if they
are sensitive enough.

895
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:35,210
From My photograph, the way I sit, the way
I talk, immediately everyone asks.

896
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:39,040
The other day where I went for the meeting
with My husband, everybody was asking, "Who

897
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,040
is this lady?"

898
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:41,040
"Who is this lady?"

899
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:45,111
"Who is this lady?"

900
01:06:45,111 --> 01:06:46,460
There's something in the personality.

901
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:53,181
I talk to everyone nicely, I'm very sweet.

902
01:06:53,181 --> 01:06:56,760
We cannot be slavish, and we cannot enslave
anyone.

903
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:04,731
We have to cherish, even human beings we have
to cherish, because they are us.

904
01:07:04,731 --> 01:07:10,591
Not to despise anyone, not to laugh at anyone.

905
01:07:10,591 --> 01:07:17,171
In the culture of Sahaj, you have to become
an expert: expertise.

906
01:07:17,171 --> 01:07:25,050
Expertise comes through your adherence to
your Mother.

907
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:29,730
Expertise: you all should be an expert, and
who will give you the certificate is your

908
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:32,260
Mother only - who else?

909
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:41,331
I may not say so, but your spirit will say
that, and not your ego.

910
01:07:41,331 --> 01:07:47,609
In this short time whatever was possible,
it's such a big subject, culture is; you cannot.

911
01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:54,399
But I've talked to you, I would not say in
a very analytical way, but in a very synthetic

912
01:07:54,399 --> 01:07:56,569
manner.

913
01:07:56,569 --> 01:07:59,370
So I've given you very synthesis of the whole
thing.

914
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:06,230
"Analytical" would be one, two, three, four,
five - cut short - two, three, four, five,

915
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:07,260
like that.

916
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:09,340
It's not like that.

917
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:11,701
And that is how you have to speak to people.

918
01:08:11,701 --> 01:08:16,649
One, this is so; two, this is so; three, this
is so; finished.

919
01:08:16,649 --> 01:08:18,549
You are not Sahaja yogis.

920
01:08:18,550 --> 01:08:25,680
In your speeches if you talk like that, finished.

921
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:31,749
But before saying something or doing something,
give a little idea where you are leading the

922
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:38,029
people, so they are not frittered away, attention
is not frittered away.

923
01:08:38,029 --> 01:08:49,919
Give a little idea, as I say, or else while
talking, bring them to a point which is important,

924
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:55,801
so that they wait in the sentence to come
to that point.

925
01:08:55,801 --> 01:09:02,460
But make the whole sentence look so, that
it is going towards certain points, so always

926
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:11,951
a Sahaja yogi must make a point out of what
they talk, not just babbling, talking.

927
01:09:11,951 --> 01:09:15,940
What is the point you are going to make?

928
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:21,451
Whatever they do, they have to know, "What
are we going to achieve out of it?"

929
01:09:21,451 --> 01:09:22,630
Now, marriage.

930
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:25,320
"What are we going to achieve out of marriage?"

931
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:29,161
A family, house, everybody has, even a donkey
has that.

932
01:09:29,161 --> 01:09:31,300
What's so great?

933
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:37,021
We are going to achieve a family unit where
realized souls are to be born, we're going

934
01:09:37,021 --> 01:09:48,791
to look after them in a proper way, and then
we are going to emit that unit into this world,

935
01:09:48,791 --> 01:09:56,630
like a sparkling diamond set in the beautiful
setting of a family, giving light to the whole

936
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:59,670
world.

937
01:09:59,670 --> 01:10:09,931
So one's life should not be pointless, and
talk should not be pointless, and every moment

938
01:10:09,931 --> 01:10:20,820
should be filled with achievements of your
visions and dreams, slowly and steadily, which

939
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:26,661
is not at all difficult.

940
01:10:26,661 --> 01:10:32,920
If you can get rid of ego and superego, finished,
that's all - simple as that.

941
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:43,021
May God bless you all.

942
01:10:43,021 --> 01:10:53,110
Mm.. good.. nice.. relaxed, eh?

943
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:55,130
Relaxed.

944
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:57,150
Witness.

945
01:10:57,150 --> 01:11:06,701
Everyone cleared out, I think.

946
01:11:06,701 --> 01:11:12,951
And no more… one more thing I must say last,
as I've said it before, which I've not said

947
01:11:12,951 --> 01:11:18,351
here, no-one is going to say that bhoot did
it, because such a person will be sent away

948
01:11:18,351 --> 01:11:22,481
to the bhoot clan, not to Sahaja Yoga.

949
01:11:22,481 --> 01:11:27,440
Don't put your responsibility on the bhoots.

950
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:32,311
Either you are a bhoot or you are a Sahaja
yogi, one of the two, you can't be both.
