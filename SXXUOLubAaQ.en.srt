EXCERPTS ON SHRI MATAJI'S PHOTOGRAPH

2
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:22,637
Any other question please? Yes, please –
little loudly…

3
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:25,179
Seeker: Why is Your picture sitting
on the table next to You?

4
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,720
Can you say loudly, please?

5
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:29,285
Seeker: Why is Your picture sitting
on the table next to You?

6
00:00:29,486 --> 00:00:33,875
Shri Mataji: What's it…? yogi: Why is Your
picture sitting on the table next to You?

7
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,052
Why, you don’t like it?

8
00:00:41,904 --> 00:00:45,749
It’s something, it’s a question really
something I can’t understand.

9
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,601
You see, if I am something, if this
picture is my true picture,

10
00:00:52,209 --> 00:00:57,028
then why not have it? With this picture,
you’ll be surprised,

11
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:00,328
the person who first got realization got
through this picture.

12
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:04,775
In this picture there are vibrations. When
you will get realized, you will know

13
00:01:04,976 --> 00:01:08,136
that only this picture has such vibrations
because the real thing it is –

14
00:01:08,337 --> 00:01:10,953
thank God the science has given us
the real thing.

15
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,055
If there were cameras before, we would
have had pictures

16
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:17,423
of all those great people. Because there
were no photographs

17
00:01:17,624 --> 00:01:19,516
they said, “Better not have any pictures.”

18
00:01:19,717 --> 00:01:22,322
Because all the pictures were imaginary,
done by people

19
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:25,014
who wanted to have some money.

20
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:31,346
With this picture, many people have been
cured. All right?

21
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:35,078
It’s a very good thing that has happened
that we can take pictures now

22
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:38,408
because I think, I cannot meet everyone
in this world,

23
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:40,766
but they can at least see my picture.

24
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:47,279
Question: Can we just clarify that do you
claim that you can heal or cure?

25
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:50,794
Shri Mataji: I do not claim; I do it.

26
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:54,846
No question of claiming, you see. I do it.
I’ve done it.

27
00:01:55,047 --> 00:01:59,000
You can do it also. Everyone can do it.

28
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:02,940
This Doctor Warren has done. He’s cured
so many people.

29
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:05,651
Question: And you said it can be done
through the photograph.

30
00:02:05,852 --> 00:02:08,594
Would you explain that? Shri Mataji: Yes,
it is surprising, you know.

31
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:13,182
Myself I was surprised, as you are, that
my photograph has also got vibrations

32
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,680
and people get cured with photographs.

33
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:20,540
In your country only when I came,
the press was very kind to me.

34
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:24,196
The reason was there was a lady who
was sick with coma.

35
00:02:24,397 --> 00:02:29,399
And they said she had what … Yogi: Cerebral
aneurism. Shri Mataji: Aneurism.

36
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,491
And one another disciple of mine

37
00:02:33,692 --> 00:02:36,101
took my photograph, put it under her head.

38
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:42,305
And she started getting all right in the
sense that she started opening her eyes.

39
00:02:42,506 --> 00:02:45,803
So the doctors got frightened. They said,
“Even if she gets all right,

40
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:48,996
she will be damaged. She won’t be able
to walk.”

41
00:02:49,197 --> 00:02:51,632
But today she’s perfectly all right.
Not only that,

42
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:56,055
but she is very hard-working sahaja
yogini so she is all right.

43
00:02:56,256 --> 00:03:00,177
Question: How does it work? Shri Mataji:
It was in … Yogi: How does it work?

44
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:04,119
How does it work from the photograph?
Shri Mataji: From the photograph?

45
00:03:04,882 --> 00:03:08,664
The photograph is a real image of myself,
you see,

46
00:03:08,865 --> 00:03:13,463
and this, my body, has got a coefficients
which emits vibrations.

47
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:19,821
Same happens with the photograph.
That too has the same coefficients.

48
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:22,781
Of course, it hasn’t got the other
dimension,

49
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:29,482
but it also emits the vibrations because
of the coefficients being the same.

50
00:03:29,683 --> 00:03:32,014
Say, even if you take Christ’s photograph,
it’s not real

51
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:34,821
because it has come out of the unconscious,
all right,

52
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:36,914
but that’s a lot of imagination put in.

53
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:40,866
Any photograph, if you take of any person
it is like that.

54
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:46,234
But there are so many things I’ve seen
which have come out of the Mother Earth,

55
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:52,432
they emit vibrations. Like Stonehenge
in England has vibrations.

56
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:55,761
So many places like that have vibrations,
but not so strong as mine,

57
00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:58,125
because I’m a living person.

58
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:05,531
There was one fellow in Russia,

59
00:04:05,732 --> 00:04:08,207
supposed to be very intelligent,

60
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:11,148
he said that: “Alright, if we keep Mother’s
photograph

61
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,772
and also the icons, we can get the same
type of vibrations.”

62
00:04:15,973 --> 00:04:20,758
You cannot, because icons are made

63
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,791
by some artist’s imaginary.

64
00:04:23,993 --> 00:04:28,540
These are not representing actually even
Maria or Christ or anyone,

65
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:31,372
they are all, all imaginary.

66
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:37,231
If Italian ones makes Christ, He is Italian
style,

67
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:42,947
if some French one makes, He is thin
like French man,

68
00:04:43,155 --> 00:04:50,822
if you get somebody say from Holland,
He will have a forehead like that.

69
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:58,399
So you can see Christ if He’s Japanese,
He’ll have chinky eyes,

70
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:04,136
if He’s Chinese, He’ll have no nose,

71
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:11,918
if it’s Indian, He’ll be dark. So all kinds
of Christs I have seen

72
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:18,018
and I feel that, "How can they emit
vibrations?" Tell me.

73
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:22,496
While with my photograph, how can you
compare?

74
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:26,047
Also, cameras were to be developed
at this time:

75
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:28,490
do you notice that point?

76
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:33,699
Cameras were developed at this time,
not before that.

77
00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:38,225
This loudspeaker was not developed before
this.

78
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,728
So all these things are – even video,

79
00:05:41,929 --> 00:05:45,403
even the way you are seeing my image there,

80
00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:48,625
was that available before? No.

81
00:05:51,363 --> 00:05:58,131
So this is a very special time, where
science has also supported

82
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,546
seekers to find the Truth – science has
supported.

83
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:06,767
So first, just like a scientist, to try
to accept one by… there is nothing

84
00:06:06,968 --> 00:06:09,856
has to be done, I mean, you do not have
to pay me anything of course, that goes...

85
00:06:10,057 --> 00:06:13,307
You don't have to do any acrobatics
or anything.

86
00:06:13,508 --> 00:06:15,385
But for example a small thing like
my photograph,

87
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:17,448
you see, many people say, “Why Your
photographs?”

88
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:20,535
So “Use your photograph” I say, if that
works out, you see.

89
00:06:20,736 --> 00:06:21,935
It's something surprising:

90
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:23,980
that’s how people are challenging me:
“Why Your photograph?”.

91
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:26,525
“Why don’t you use yours? I will be very
happy, use anybody’s”…

92
00:06:26,726 --> 00:06:30,307
… but doesn’t work out, what to do now?
Is my photograph that works out,

93
00:06:30,508 --> 00:06:34,907
but even if you don't like it, you have
to use it – what can I do?

94
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,129
Is as simple like that, you see; but
in that I don't gain anything from you,

95
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:45,247
I don't want anything from you, nothing
material that you can give me.

96
00:06:45,448 --> 00:06:48,949
But you'll enjoy, you will enjoy my love,
you'll enjoy.

97
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:55,880
But Sahaja Yoga is becoming, is awakening
and Realisation.

98
00:06:56,131 --> 00:06:59,455
How is it going to work out? It was a very
big problem for me.

99
00:06:59,656 --> 00:07:02,307
It’s not that I can just give you a book
and just sit

100
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:06,616
and read it and say that, “Yes, I have
got it, I have become.”

101
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:12,252
It’s real becoming, ripening, maturing,
living process.

102
00:07:12,453 --> 00:07:14,911
Now how am I to do it?

103
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:19,980
And here is the answer – is a photograph.

104
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:27,192
So this is what it is, that all your medias
can be used

105
00:07:28,378 --> 00:07:32,399
through my photograph. What a blessing
it is!

106
00:07:32,682 --> 00:07:36,943
And the photograph, if you think,
is representing me,

107
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:40,755
I think you are not expressing it fully.

108
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,473
I was amazed that my photographs are
much more powerful

109
00:07:46,737 --> 00:07:51,517
than any statues put together – even
produced by Mother Earth!

110
00:07:54,892 --> 00:08:00,103
Because photograph has got so many
elements in it.

111
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:06,486
For example, you see, it has got light
element,

112
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:12,232
it has got water element, it has got earth
element,

113
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:17,180
it has got also air element.

114
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:22,344
If the air is not all right, you cannot get
a photograph.

115
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:29,719
And also it has got the ether element.

116
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:39,452
With all these five elements, you cannot
produce a statue.

117
00:08:44,003 --> 00:08:48,275
Ether element it has got because if you
have a photograph here,

118
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:51,555
you can transcend it to any other place
you can –

119
00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:55,981
what do you call that? – transmit it
to any place.

120
00:08:56,214 --> 00:08:57,574
Photograph can be transmitted.

121
00:08:57,775 --> 00:09:01,100
But you cannot transmit the statue as it is
anywhere,

122
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:04,640
only the photograph of a statue you can.

123
00:09:06,788 --> 00:09:09,752
So it has also got ether element.

124
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:18,244
So photograph is much more powerful than
any other statue.

125
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:24,043
Moreover, it is a reproduction, no doubt,

126
00:09:25,344 --> 00:09:30,548
but reproduction of reality, with five
elements.

127
00:09:33,722 --> 00:09:35,946
So I shouldn’t call it just
a representative,

128
00:09:36,147 --> 00:09:41,447
it’s quite me. Because my attention is
there.

129
00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:45,361
So the protocol of these photographs
also is important

130
00:09:45,592 --> 00:09:49,429
to start developing that faith.

131
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:57,994
You should keep one photograph with you
all the time in your pocket. Respect it.

132
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:03,450
As many as possible, respect them.
