00:00:03.406 --> 00:00:08.433
﻿I have been always telling you that Sahaj Yoga,

00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:13.267
it is sprouting of your seed within you.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.233
When the seed is dormant you cannot visualise

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:24.543
the maps it has in
it of all the creations it is going to create.

00:00:24.744 --> 00:00:28.770
Out of one seed, how many trees have grown,

00:00:28.971 --> 00:00:32.400
how many fruits have come out 
and how many seeds are coming out

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.110
and how many they are going to produce.

00:00:35.803 --> 00:00:41.456
You cannot understand how dynamic it is.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.667
There has been talk about the Spirit within you.

00:00:48.273 --> 00:00:53.500
Many have said that the
Spirit is to be brought into our conscious mind.

00:00:54.216 --> 00:00:56.533
We have to achieve our Spirit.

00:00:56.733 --> 00:01:00.300
We have to get our Yoga – the Union with God.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.233
When they said it, they
meant it to be done, not to be just talked about.

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:15.467
But as everything goes
to waste much more than it is utilised,

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:19.533
all these descriptions

00:01:19.852 --> 00:01:23.033
of the Self to be achieved

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:28.533
– how, when – everything got lost

00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:33.567
because they started just talking about it.

00:01:34.483 --> 00:01:37.633
People like to intellectualise everything,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.467
they do not want to imbibe it.

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:48.767
Just to talk big about something,

00:01:49.548 --> 00:01:51.748
their ego gets pampered,

00:01:51.948 --> 00:01:56.821
they’ll stand up and give big
lectures on Gita and all those things,

00:02:02.796 --> 00:02:08.667
but they have
no idea as to what Gita wants you to do:

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.133
it wants you to find out the Truth,

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:24.433
it wants you to get your Realisation,
to have your yoga established.

00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:29.833
You have to be born again, you have to be
christened as they said, you have to be baptised.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.700
But the difference
between the reality and unreality is such

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.100
that we think if we talk
about it, we have done it.

00:02:43.643 --> 00:02:45.877
This is the illusion, the Mahamaya.

00:02:46.077 --> 00:02:50.167
We live with it and we carry on with it,

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:54.133
we are very happy with it because it
means you do not have to face any reality.

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:59.433
You can live with unreal life. But you
cannot even live with unreal life, can you?

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:02.733
That is not going to give you joy.

00:03:04.546 --> 00:03:09.700
With unreality you are not going to be satisfied.

00:03:10.803 --> 00:03:15.633
You are not going to get your joy,
you are not going to get your meaning

00:03:15.834 --> 00:03:18.067
and you are going to discard yourself

00:03:18.267 --> 00:03:22.467
as a useless thing, unless and
until you find out why you are here.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.233
So everybody wants to find out in a way
but honestly, but on a slippery ground.

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.103
He wants to find out the reality on one side;

00:03:33.303 --> 00:03:37.900
on the other side the slippery ground
is always taking him away from the Reality.

00:03:38.763 --> 00:03:42.000
The struggle is on, within us.

00:03:46.636 --> 00:03:49.900
You have to just keep yourself on the ground,

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.967
not allow yourself to be slipped out into
any extreme behaviour for anything whatsoever.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.733
Just be there – it works out.

00:04:01.596 --> 00:04:05.196
But we are extremists, in
everything we go to extremes.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.467
Just now today I was
discussing capitalism, democracy and communism.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.867
Say, Abraham Lincoln was a realised-soul,

00:04:19.156 --> 00:04:22.700
no doubt; he had his vision of democracy.

00:04:23.256 --> 00:04:25.267
But he could not fulfil it

00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:29.149
because others were not realised-souls
they could not come up to his vision

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.655
and they could not imbibe these things within them.

00:04:31.856 --> 00:04:36.223
They just praised him. He’s their hero.
They’ll make a statue out of him,

00:04:36.424 --> 00:04:38.723
garland him, write books on him,

00:04:38.924 --> 00:04:42.867
but nothing of Abraham Lincoln
goes into their being, nothing.

00:04:43.067 --> 00:04:46.467
They do not follow him
in the way he lived his life.

00:04:47.663 --> 00:04:51.350
They’ll call them ‘Lincolnists’
or something like that.

00:04:52.147 --> 00:04:55.267
Some sort of a “ism” they’ll put to that.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:01.000
They will try to possess him,
brand him into something,

00:05:01.353 --> 00:05:04.833
but not try to imbibe him into themselves.

00:05:05.153 --> 00:05:08.740
Then, Lenin was a realised-soul, too,
as I told you, he was a realised-soul.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.367
He had a vision of
collectivity, very proper vision he had.

00:05:13.567 --> 00:05:16.247
But he found that people are
going to fail him. He cannot do it.

00:05:16.447 --> 00:05:19.806
So he had to, he shifted into another, he drifted.

00:05:24.686 --> 00:05:29.073
Anywhere you find a person who’s a realised-soul,

00:05:29.273 --> 00:05:32.533
in his own way he has made contribution.

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:35.266
I’ll say Shakespeare the other day I went to…

00:05:35.466 --> 00:05:38.767
Now, Shakespeare was a very 
great realised-soul, no doubt about it.

00:05:38.967 --> 00:05:42.600
His contribution is so beautiful,
but people do not see it.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.567
They have no eyes to see what he’s trying to show.

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.649
Say we saw Hamlet.

00:05:48.215 --> 00:05:53.200
Hamlet is what? Is nothing but he’s trying
to show the futility of every nonsense we do.

00:05:54.086 --> 00:05:57.067
First of all a man killing another king.

00:05:57.313 --> 00:05:59.933
Then the woman running after that man.

00:06:00.206 --> 00:06:03.053
Because the father is killed
the father comes to the boy

00:06:03.253 --> 00:06:06.933
and compels him that you should
take revenge. He taking revenge.

00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:09.800
One little girl, innocent girl,
madly loving that fellow.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.667
I mean, the whole life is
made into something so small.

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.170
The mother’s life, she has no esteem,

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.263
she thinks that by loving 
this man she is the last word.

00:06:23.463 --> 00:06:25.369
So she can kill her husband.

00:06:26.223 --> 00:06:28.933
The husband, so-called the second husband,

00:06:29.133 --> 00:06:34.033
he thinks by killing this man and
getting this woman, he achieves the last.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.700
Then the third person is this poor son,

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.830
who gets the ghost to tell
him that “this has happened.”

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.700
The ghost himself should die and go
away from this world and live where he is.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.110
But he comes back and tells
him that, “You take the revenge.”

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:54.167
He is not interested in his [son’s]
Spirit, in his well-being, the father also.

00:06:54.367 --> 00:06:58.300
Now the son takes a tip and he goes on hating.

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:02.000
He gets into this of destroy.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:05.700
He wants to destroy this man.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.803
In that destruction he kills
the father of that little girl -

00:07:11.596 --> 00:07:15.233
his fiancee – and the girl 
also dies, she also becomes mad.

00:07:15.433 --> 00:07:18.602
Everybody becomes mad. Even Hamlet becomes mad.

00:07:19.313 --> 00:07:21.833
What does he show, you see?

00:07:22.606 --> 00:07:28.433
I call him Shakespeare, an avadhuta. Avadhuta is a
person who’s beyond.

00:07:29.373 --> 00:07:33.173
He’s a person who’s not an incarnation.
Incarnation comes on this earth,

00:07:33.374 --> 00:07:36.033
plays with you, lives with you, acts like you,

00:07:36.233 --> 00:07:40.233
goes with you into all kinds of
moods and things you live with,

00:07:40.643 --> 00:07:43.700
and tries to help you on that level.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:49.233
The incarnation can come down very little.
They do not. They keep themselves there.

00:07:49.723 --> 00:07:51.967
And what do they show? The futility,

00:07:52.167 --> 00:07:56.142
the futility of this kind of a
nonsensical life people are leading.

00:07:56.343 --> 00:08:00.833
This is what he tried to show in Hamlet.

00:08:01.076 --> 00:08:04.500
Now, how many people who
read Hamlet understand this point

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:10.157
that the futility of even taking
the revenge on his mother

00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:14.000
or the fellow who killed his father was there?

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.933
It’s so evident.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.667
All those emotions to which
we pay so much importance

00:08:22.867 --> 00:08:27.270
and make it so much
identified with your whole life,

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.900
are nothing but wasteful

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.210
and futile things, we are wasting our energy.

00:08:35.603 --> 00:08:38.063
So he puts a drama before you.

00:08:38.263 --> 00:08:41.100
“See, this drama is a play. See now.”

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.767
Now what happens, you become Hamlet
if you see that. You become one of the persons.

00:08:45.967 --> 00:08:49.833
If you see that drama you’ll become
Hamlet. Immediately you start thinking,

00:08:50.033 --> 00:08:53.797
“How many revenges I have to take?” You’ll make a
list of people.

00:08:54.216 --> 00:08:59.100
You immediately become Hamlet. You do
not become Shakespeare, you become Hamlet.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:04.267
“And now how many people have I to hurt?
How many revenges have I to take?

00:09:04.467 --> 00:09:07.900
Which is the way I should do?
Should I play a drama the way he played?”

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:12.767
Or you can even become the lady. You
can even become the person who killed,

00:09:12.967 --> 00:09:16.400
you can become anything, instead of becoming

00:09:17.673 --> 00:09:21.367
the person who has created it.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:26.800
That’s how we live in
unreality in our life all the time.

00:09:28.136 --> 00:09:32.167
Instead of imbibing Christ’s life within our life,

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.833
we find another drama,

00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:38.693
we play with that drama and
identify ourselves with that drama.

00:09:42.176 --> 00:09:48.033
This drama is going to keep you in
that dramatic condition all the time.

00:09:48.436 --> 00:09:51.200
Reality is to finish the drama,

00:09:51.643 --> 00:09:55.800
to know that it is a
drama. We are not part and parcel of that.

00:09:56.183 --> 00:09:59.200
This is what is the Real state of the mind.

00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:02.733
Unless and until that is achieved,
you are not going to be happy,

00:10:02.933 --> 00:10:05.367
you are not going to be satisfied,

00:10:09.287 --> 00:10:13.567
you are not going to be your Self,

00:10:14.696 --> 00:10:17.367
you are not going to find out your meaning.

00:10:18.846 --> 00:10:21.367
This is what Sahaja Yoga is,

00:10:22.566 --> 00:10:27.200
that a happening takes place within
you, the Kundalini rises within you.

00:10:27.533 --> 00:10:31.367
She passes through
all these various centres and gives you that,

00:10:32.036 --> 00:10:37.367
what we call the Self-realisation, by
enlightening your consciousness with the Spirit.

00:10:39.607 --> 00:10:45.067
If seed is the Spirit, then Kundalini is the water

00:10:45.267 --> 00:10:48.390
that pours on it its grace

00:10:48.903 --> 00:10:52.967
and manifests it in our consciousness.

00:10:53.416 --> 00:10:57.133
It is manifested by itself,
but not in our consciousness.

00:10:57.523 --> 00:11:01.333
So our consciousness and our attention becomes one
with that.

00:11:06.733 --> 00:11:10.267
This is how the things work out.

00:11:12.599 --> 00:11:16.033
One has to know that God has created you.

00:11:16.453 --> 00:11:18.433
You have not created yourself.

00:11:19.653 --> 00:11:22.700
He has made you human beings from amoeba stage.

00:11:23.013 --> 00:11:26.667
He has brought you to this level and
He’s going to give you the Ultimate.

00:11:26.867 --> 00:11:29.433
He’s going to do it for you. It’s His job.

00:11:30.459 --> 00:11:32.463
It’s not your job.

00:11:34.096 --> 00:11:36.843
Now in a case like that
when you think that there is

00:11:37.043 --> 00:11:43.133
– say first case is we can take of people
who believe in social injustice sort of going on.

00:11:43.686 --> 00:11:46.400
What should we do in social injustice?

00:11:46.926 --> 00:11:50.612
Which is the greatest
force? Which is the greatest power on this earth?

00:11:50.813 --> 00:11:55.367
The one which manages all
the other powers is the power of God.

00:11:56.493 --> 00:12:01.033
Today as the time is, achieve that power

00:12:01.833 --> 00:12:07.833
and then work it out through that power
and not through your intellectual power,

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.143
which will create problems for you.

00:12:11.343 --> 00:12:15.167
Any social injustice, if
you work it out on your level,

00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:19.500
will never reach its successful stage.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:24.100
It will be just falling short of its achievement.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.513
Everything has gone wrong because of that.

00:12:27.825 --> 00:12:29.800
The power that controls

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.912
the whole Universe, every part
of it, every particle of it, every atom of it,

00:12:36.112 --> 00:12:40.400
is the power which is called
as Divine Power of God.

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.117
That is the power of God’s Love.

00:12:43.317 --> 00:12:49.367
In His love He bestows all that is beautiful
to you and removes all that is ugly in you.

00:12:49.567 --> 00:12:52.887
For that He may have to sometimes even kill you.

00:12:54.925 --> 00:12:57.466
He may have to even destroy. It’s His power.

00:12:57.666 --> 00:13:02.433
It’s not your power to destroy anyone.
You have no right to destroy anyone.

00:13:04.519 --> 00:13:07.533
It is His power to destroy you.

00:13:07.819 --> 00:13:10.167
Please put your hands like this and sit quietly.

00:13:10.367 --> 00:13:12.439
Don’t make noises and things in Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:12.639 --> 00:13:17.983
You see, all these things which these gurus have
done to you and you are really ruined by them.

00:13:18.183 --> 00:13:22.267
That happening takes place within yourself and not
outside.

00:13:22.793 --> 00:13:26.177
All these ideas
come to us again from the same myth

00:13:26.476 --> 00:13:29.963
that we can achieve our
Realisation, we can stand on our heads,

00:13:30.163 --> 00:13:33.423
we can breathe fast,
we can breathe less. How can it be?

00:13:33.797 --> 00:13:37.633
I mean, everything these things are
done by animals and by every person.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.633
How can you do it? You cannot do

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:47.533
anything to achieve your Self-realisation.
This must be accepted with complete humility.

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:50.967
It’s also God’s job. Everything He does.

00:13:51.686 --> 00:13:54.900
Only thing what you have to 
do is to merge into His Power

00:13:55.232 --> 00:13:57.500
and then you can tell Him whatever you like

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:02.633
because then you become
His Power and you can work it out.

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:06.158
But anything

00:14:06.359 --> 00:14:10.633
external that you are doing
now before Realisation has no meaning.

00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:15.067
When the power flows through
you, then you can manoeuvre it,

00:14:15.933 --> 00:14:18.100
then you can organise it, you can work it out.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.883
First of all, achieve your Spirit.

00:14:22.769 --> 00:14:26.667
Then allow it to manifest itself within you,

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.967
fully establish it. After full
establishment, then you work it out.

00:14:34.653 --> 00:14:37.533
There is no hanky-panky about it, one should know.

00:14:37.859 --> 00:14:40.710
And you cannot befool anyone.

00:14:42.087 --> 00:14:44.800
It’s something that has to happen within you.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.933
We are deceiving ourself. Do not do that.

00:14:49.413 --> 00:14:51.933
We do not want to waste our lives.

00:14:54.813 --> 00:14:57.533
We are not going to make ourselves

00:14:58.192 --> 00:15:00.700
so low as to

00:15:02.953 --> 00:15:05.900
destroy this being

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:09.600
which is just there to manifest.

00:15:12.313 --> 00:15:15.667
All those things that we worry about,

00:15:15.867 --> 00:15:20.000
say our personal things and natural
things and this and that and that and that,

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.900
you cannot help it out;

00:15:24.446 --> 00:15:26.383
you cannot cure it.

00:15:26.757 --> 00:15:30.333
Unless and until you
are a realised-soul you cannot help it

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.667
and that, too,
a realised-soul in a very collective way.

00:15:35.167 --> 00:15:38.433
If you are collectively realised you can do it;

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.267
otherwise, you cannot do it.

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:45.733
The whole emancipation and the whole great work

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.167
of bringing humanity into the kingdom of God

00:15:50.367 --> 00:15:56.033
is only possible if you all get
your Realisation fully established.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.233
Now, after Realisation also

00:16:02.434 --> 00:16:05.743
I received a telephone
call today from someone that,

00:16:05.943 --> 00:16:10.100
“Mother, that day I got Realisation
all my worries went away,

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:15.517
I got completely relaxed and the cool breeze started
coming into my hand. I felt very much better.

00:16:15.717 --> 00:16:19.500
But now gradually again the tension
is mounting up.

00:16:22.473 --> 00:16:25.259
Is my Self-realisation temporary?”

00:16:25.459 --> 00:16:29.033
Self-realisation is not temporary
but you are temporary.

00:16:30.893 --> 00:16:33.600
How much attention have you paid to yourself?

00:16:34.773 --> 00:16:38.700
For example, some guest is coming to your house

00:16:39.619 --> 00:16:42.533
and you close the doors to him,

00:16:45.667 --> 00:16:48.967
will he come to you begging of you?

00:16:52.993 --> 00:16:58.400
If he comes inside also you do not give
it a proper eminence as the position is.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.700
The Spirit is the highest and if
you do not give it the highest position,

00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:07.300
that my Spirit is the highest and
I must pay full attention to my Spirit

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.627
and you fritter away your
attention on to other things,

00:17:10.827 --> 00:17:15.133
is he going to be there on your seat of heart?

00:17:15.333 --> 00:17:17.600
Is he going to be settled down there?

00:17:18.213 --> 00:17:21.600
How much attention
have you paid to your Self-realisation?

00:17:22.006 --> 00:17:24.267
You have taken it for granted,

00:17:24.519 --> 00:17:27.433
and then what have you done about it?

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.567
The Spirit won’t be happy with one person.

00:17:35.173 --> 00:17:38.667
When the Spirit starts
manifesting through you like light,

00:17:39.019 --> 00:17:42.098
it wants that it should be put

00:17:42.299 --> 00:17:47.970
on a higher place from where
everybody could see and get their Spirit.

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:50.200
It wants its company.

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:53.967
It seeks its collectivity.

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:56.900
If it is not there it is going to run away.

00:17:58.307 --> 00:18:00.700
If you cannot enjoy

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.990
the love

00:18:06.783 --> 00:18:11.496
of other Sahaj Yogis you are not going to achieve.

00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:16.257
Now in this country of yours,
I must say, we had a variety of Sahaj Yogis

00:18:16.457 --> 00:18:20.067
which is something such a
great drama for me also to see.

00:18:20.267 --> 00:18:22.933
And the varieties and varieties I have seen

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:27.100
in the West I have never seen
them before, specially in England

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:30.900
because they
are very cosmopolitan and international.

00:18:32.006 --> 00:18:36.500
Now the lowest level of Sahaj Yogis are there

00:18:37.126 --> 00:18:39.733
who think that they can exploit Sahaj Yoga

00:18:40.312 --> 00:18:44.233
to such an extent, I mean,
they are such low types that you cannot imagine.

00:18:44.606 --> 00:18:47.667
They go to, say, a program in the ashram.

00:18:48.286 --> 00:18:52.433
Then they eat food, that’s all – not
even pay for it. I mean, that level we have.

00:18:52.633 --> 00:18:54.733
There are many who never just pay their money.

00:18:54.933 --> 00:18:56.633
Can you imagine?

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.025
Of that level we have
people who go to the ashram

00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:05.967
where they make others pay for their food.

00:19:06.813 --> 00:19:12.610
Just they want to go there. Here you are paying
for a wretched guru, who came the other day,

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.967
and gave
him a Rolls Royce as a present. Do you know that?

00:19:17.206 --> 00:19:19.133
Who is well-known,

00:19:19.626 --> 00:19:23.300
that he is a swindler, he’s made
money and all that, out of hypnotism.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:29.333
People starve themselves, beg, borrowed
and gave money to him to buy a Rolls Royce.

00:19:29.726 --> 00:19:34.000
And here is Sahaj
Yoga which gets all kinds of lepers.

00:19:35.399 --> 00:19:39.000
One of them is this kind
– I think this is the worst of all

00:19:43.133 --> 00:19:47.017
– and this kind of people
should not expect much in Sahaj Yoga.

00:19:47.217 --> 00:19:50.867
It’s better they leave and go away.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.400
They cannot rise: of this level of people
who think that they can go to a place

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.900
and eat the food and do not
even pay, and make others pay.

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.233
I mean, this is too much, I
can’t even understand such people.

00:20:02.433 --> 00:20:07.400
I mean, these are not human-beings.
Must be some worms born here or some parasites.

00:20:10.219 --> 00:20:13.800
Then the second kind are, there are some people

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.400
who do not know that you
have to work for Sahaj Yoga.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:23.819
You have to work for others. You are
not going to die if you are working for others.

00:20:24.499 --> 00:20:27.433
You are not to judge that what others are working.

00:20:27.866 --> 00:20:32.633
If I were to judge how much you are working,
I would have given up absolutely long time back!

00:20:32.979 --> 00:20:36.159
See the disparity in My style of
working and your style of working.

00:20:36.359 --> 00:20:39.333
You know that I work day-in and day-out.

00:20:39.919 --> 00:20:45.333
Nights together I keep awake and I have
travelled for miles together without any complaint.

00:20:45.533 --> 00:20:47.820
Today is the first day, perhaps, I'm doing it.

00:20:48.133 --> 00:20:50.500
After all, I have this physical body,

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.767
and you know how much I have worked:

00:20:53.119 --> 00:20:57.553
working on single person for hours together
and also we lose that person so many times.

00:20:57.753 --> 00:21:00.400
It’s so disappointing and so frustrating.

00:21:03.245 --> 00:21:07.159
And you people are avoiding work.

00:21:08.686 --> 00:21:11.533
You want others to wash your dishes even.

00:21:15.406 --> 00:21:18.703
Why don’t you
wash the dishes of others for a change?

00:21:18.903 --> 00:21:21.933
What does it matter? You are not going to die.

00:21:23.706 --> 00:21:26.767
But this comes out of, all
these things come out of ego.

00:21:26.967 --> 00:21:31.500
But what, from where the first one I don’t know
from where it comes that you don’t pay for your food.

00:21:34.279 --> 00:21:38.800
These people will never stick on to Sahaj
Yoga unless and until they change themselves.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.110
One has to work very, very hard on yourself.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:45.310
Now the third type,

00:21:46.699 --> 00:21:50.600
is to keep yourself cleansed. You have to work.

00:21:52.147 --> 00:21:55.367
You have to see what are
your vibrations, how are you,

00:21:56.093 --> 00:22:00.367
what are your problems. You all have had problems
you created for yourself.

00:22:00.567 --> 00:22:04.467
If you were beautiful flowers
I would have done the job Myself.

00:22:04.667 --> 00:22:08.429
But no, you have really ruined
yourself. So you have to clear out yourself.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:10.676
You have to work it out.

00:22:11.003 --> 00:22:14.667
You have to clear out yourself. You have
to love yourself as you have to love others.

00:22:14.867 --> 00:22:17.900
Now you have to love
yourself. Now come to that point.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:25.500
You have to respect yourself because this
is now the temple of God. You are a realised-soul.

00:22:26.316 --> 00:22:28.400
You are a saint.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.900
Love yourself. How much I love you,

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:37.315
in the same way you have to
love yourself and care for your body,

00:22:37.516 --> 00:22:41.833
care for your mind, care for your Spirit,

00:22:44.566 --> 00:22:47.900
pay attention to your Spirit.
“Is my Spirit happy with me?

00:22:48.193 --> 00:22:51.600
Am I doing what I should have done for my Spirit

00:22:52.283 --> 00:22:55.067
or am I doing something for my ego

00:22:55.396 --> 00:23:02.867
or for my superego or for
saving some money out of my food?”

00:23:09.243 --> 00:23:11.367
All these things,

00:23:14.003 --> 00:23:16.003
are,

00:23:19.846 --> 00:23:21.800
to be seen within us.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.510
I am not saying it for others. I’m saying for
individual persons to see what are our problems are.

00:23:27.835 --> 00:23:32.708
Now even those who are
ardently believing into Sahaja Yoga

00:23:33.168 --> 00:23:35.295
and are going into it

00:23:35.661 --> 00:23:39.108
must know that they have had really big problems.

00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:43.067
I’ve never told but some of
you are suffering from cancer

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:50.877
which is settling in fast,
and I’m worried about them.

00:23:52.043 --> 00:23:55.967
Some of you have serious physical
problems which I have not told you.

00:23:57.849 --> 00:24:01.367
Some of you have very,
very serious mental problems.

00:24:02.796 --> 00:24:05.867
You must see all those things.
You must correct yourself.

00:24:06.067 --> 00:24:10.943
As I said, you must love yourself
and understand that you are the saint.

00:24:11.783 --> 00:24:15.500
You cannot just play about
with yourself and try to ruin it,

00:24:16.636 --> 00:24:19.522
just not paying any attention to yourself,

00:24:19.723 --> 00:24:21.488
just taking it easy.

00:24:21.689 --> 00:24:25.767
It’s a precious trust you have with you,

00:24:25.967 --> 00:24:28.400
because your Spirit is enlightened,

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:30.533
because you are the light

00:24:30.733 --> 00:24:34.433
for all the rest of the
people of this world who are walking in the dark.

00:24:34.983 --> 00:24:38.933
Keep your light afloat, keep it clean.

00:24:41.336 --> 00:24:44.000
You are specially you are bestowed this.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.367
Upon you this great grace has fallen.

00:24:48.876 --> 00:24:51.533
All this beauty, are you going to waste it

00:24:51.734 --> 00:24:53.523
because

00:24:55.223 --> 00:24:56.967
your light

00:24:57.236 --> 00:25:00.333
is not shown through your dirty panels?

00:25:02.896 --> 00:25:06.500
We have to think about it and that’s how

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.433
once you come up at least this much

00:25:09.913 --> 00:25:12.400
then one can work with you.

00:25:12.716 --> 00:25:14.700
Face yourself as you are.

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.667
You try to give explanations.
Explanations are not wanted!

00:25:19.849 --> 00:25:22.136
Who wants explanations here? Whom are you giving?

00:25:22.336 --> 00:25:24.955
I am your Mother. I love you.
What explanations are you giving?

00:25:25.156 --> 00:25:28.900
Even anything big happens to you,
I will go out of the way to save you.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:31.876
Even if you beat Me,
and murder Me still I love you.

00:25:32.077 --> 00:25:34.567
So what explanation can you give Me?

00:25:34.879 --> 00:25:38.400
No explanation is needed My children.

00:25:39.603 --> 00:25:44.367
It is what you do to yourself is
the point I am concerned about you.

00:25:47.533 --> 00:25:51.367
What are you doing to yourself is the main point.

00:25:52.266 --> 00:25:54.466
And when you understand that,

00:25:54.666 --> 00:25:59.916
“Am I the most beautiful
representative of Sahaja Yoga?

00:26:00.819 --> 00:26:04.700
Am I the person who can influence others

00:26:05.403 --> 00:26:07.404
with my light?

00:26:07.605 --> 00:26:12.600
Am I looking after my light?” It’s very
easy to make out, you get your vibrations.

00:26:12.951 --> 00:26:15.583
Your vibrations are flowing if you are in light.

00:26:15.784 --> 00:26:18.270
There is the way of finding it out where you are.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:22.488
It’s not like other gurus just taking money
from you, and you are walking in the dark.

00:26:22.689 --> 00:26:25.000
If you know what chakras you are catching,

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.301
where is the problem, what is happening to you,

00:26:28.502 --> 00:26:31.455
why it is happening, what are the
deities, what mantra is to be said

00:26:31.655 --> 00:26:34.554
– everything you know – despite that,

00:26:34.755 --> 00:26:38.200
why is it that there is no progress and growth?

00:26:39.496 --> 00:26:42.609
Because you have no self-esteem,

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:46.733
you have no love or you are not in the centre.

00:26:47.736 --> 00:26:50.367
Unless and until you are in the centre

00:26:51.203 --> 00:26:53.597
– that’s what these
avadhutas have done all throughout.

00:26:53.797 --> 00:26:58.863
They have tried to show that: Be in the centre.
Why are you going to extremes? Leave it to God.

00:27:02.099 --> 00:27:07.000
Now, when it comes to that we are very
clever to cheat ourselves. That’s intelligence.

00:27:07.327 --> 00:27:10.167
Leave it to God. So cleansing,
you leave it to God, alright?

00:27:10.367 --> 00:27:13.667
That’s what part you leave it
to God, that God should clean us,

00:27:13.867 --> 00:27:17.407
that part is God’s job. And what is your job?

00:27:17.608 --> 00:27:19.460
Then is to do, what will you do?

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.953
If I ask then what are you
supposed to do? If I have to do cleaning,

00:27:23.153 --> 00:27:26.300
I have to look after all your meditation,

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.233
I have to put your Kundalini up,
I have to keep it there hanging,

00:27:29.433 --> 00:27:31.160
and you have to pull that!

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.100
That’s your job.

00:27:34.713 --> 00:27:37.933
In every way
possible if you try to pull down your Kundalini,

00:27:38.683 --> 00:27:40.867
how long is she going to be there?

00:27:42.156 --> 00:27:45.000
I’m giving you the extreme case

00:27:45.986 --> 00:27:50.400
but despite all that,
Kundalini is your own Mother.

00:27:52.026 --> 00:27:55.000
I am much more spread out than She is.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.900
She’s just localised within
you, she loves you really!

00:28:01.106 --> 00:28:03.267
She loves you very much

00:28:04.893 --> 00:28:09.500
and She tells Me what’s wrong with
you, She asks for forgiveness for you.

00:28:11.713 --> 00:28:13.600
She wants Me...

00:28:15.293 --> 00:28:17.400
Put down her child.

00:28:17.843 --> 00:28:21.633
She puts forward all the problems you have.

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:24.616
She wants Me to work hard.

00:28:27.009 --> 00:28:31.967
She works hard herself very much, day in and
day out. Once she’s awakened She has no sleep.

00:28:32.243 --> 00:28:35.133
Twenty-four
hours she’s working, She’s helping you,

00:28:35.333 --> 00:28:40.587
She’s guiding you, she’s coordinating
all the things that are needed for you.

00:28:40.787 --> 00:28:42.733
She brings all the blessings

00:28:42.933 --> 00:28:45.833
upon you to show that now you are awakened,

00:28:46.033 --> 00:28:48.612
you are growing, you are 
transforming, you are changing.

00:28:48.813 --> 00:28:51.300
“See, see for yourself”.

00:28:53.139 --> 00:28:57.775
She is the one who pierces the Sahasrara,
and the whole Grace falls into you.

00:28:57.976 --> 00:29:01.882
Without Her piercing the Grace is also useless.

00:29:02.196 --> 00:29:04.600
Without Her awakening I’m useless.

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:07.400
Without her help I cannot do anything.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.600
To such a Mother what homage do we pay?

00:29:13.083 --> 00:29:15.733
What do we do for Her to please Her?

00:29:16.923 --> 00:29:18.936
We should find out.

00:29:19.503 --> 00:29:23.267
She’s pleased all the time, that doesn’t
mean that you take Her for granted.

00:29:25.319 --> 00:29:29.419
It is your duty, your gratitude which expands you.

00:29:31.206 --> 00:29:35.700
So to grow in the centre 
is to be in the centre, to see,

00:29:36.899 --> 00:29:39.576
that you do not go to extremes.

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:45.500
As I have told you that the 
things that are to be done by you

00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:49.934
should be done by you, and whatever 
are to be done by God will be done by God.

00:29:50.926 --> 00:29:55.633
The simple example is that when it 
comes to cleansing your personal things

00:29:55.834 --> 00:29:57.933
you leave it to God,

00:29:58.133 --> 00:30:02.500
but when it comes, say, to telling 
others something which will hurt them,

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.767
you take it up upon yourself

00:30:06.316 --> 00:30:10.367
which will show off your ego!

00:30:10.747 --> 00:30:15.667
We’ve had examples and examples of 
ego-oriented people – horrible people they were.

00:30:15.992 --> 00:30:19.219
They took up upon themselves Sahaja
Yoga, they became the big like gurus

00:30:19.419 --> 00:30:22.812
and they started preaching. 
I’m so frightened in My lifetime!

00:30:23.012 --> 00:30:26.599
If they are doing like this what is 
going to happen? When I'm gone.

00:30:28.936 --> 00:30:31.083
Humble down yourself in your heart.

00:30:31.283 --> 00:30:34.767
There resides the Spirit of your being,

00:30:35.209 --> 00:30:37.209
of your attraction

00:30:38.576 --> 00:30:41.667
– attraction for the Divine,

00:30:42.003 --> 00:30:45.200
for God Almighty to be gracious on you,

00:30:45.563 --> 00:30:47.329
to be happy with you,

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:53.100
and in Hindi language is to be prasanna is to be
pleased with you.

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:57.533
We say, “O God! Be gracious to us,

00:30:57.856 --> 00:31:02.400
be kind to us, bestow Your grace upon us and Your
mercy upon us.”

00:31:03.223 --> 00:31:06.000
We ask in humility.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.640
He loves you.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:14.000
No one can love like Him, His love is dynamic.

00:31:14.703 --> 00:31:18.700
He is so Great that you 
cannot describe Him in words

00:31:19.076 --> 00:31:21.233
– just you can feel Him.

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:24.733
But we should not be thorn

00:31:26.416 --> 00:31:28.933
for ourselves and for Him.

00:31:31.696 --> 00:31:34.767
We are problems for Him.

00:31:34.967 --> 00:31:38.667
We are creating problems for Him. 
We are not helping in any way.

00:31:39.076 --> 00:31:42.133
We are nothing but problems and problems for Him.

00:31:42.333 --> 00:31:46.500
A day will come [when] 
He will just recede from you.

00:31:49.356 --> 00:31:52.467
Give up your personal things, personal problems

00:31:53.016 --> 00:31:55.500
and think of the bigger problems

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:58.333
for which you have to ask His grace.

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:04.533
Do not start solving yourself 
those problems but ask for His grace

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:09.367
and be humble, be humble in your heart.

00:32:10.336 --> 00:32:16.167
Be a witness of the whole thing, the
absurdities into which you have driven into.

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:21.467
Be a witness. As Hamlet has 
shown how he’s ruined the family,

00:32:21.667 --> 00:32:24.057
his own and everybody’s family.

00:32:24.257 --> 00:32:29.233
He was doing something right according
to all human laws but not according to God’s law.

00:32:30.283 --> 00:32:33.567
You have not to take the 
law into your hand, of God.

00:32:35.563 --> 00:32:37.400
God is going too.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:42.000
But, for collective things
you have got courts and this and that.

00:32:42.656 --> 00:32:45.767
Let them work it out. You don’t worry about those.

00:32:45.967 --> 00:32:52.300
You worry about your own punishments 
you want to bestow on a person. Do not do that.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.433
Let God punish them.

00:32:55.689 --> 00:32:58.967
Why do you want to do the dirty 
work of punishment? It’s horrible.

00:32:59.276 --> 00:33:02.067
I mean, if I have to punish 
somebody I don’t like it.

00:33:04.306 --> 00:33:07.867
I mean, it’s a horrible thing to 
punish someone. Why do you want to do it?

00:33:08.233 --> 00:33:12.000
Do the beautiful, that is, love others.

00:33:12.536 --> 00:33:16.333
Loving is the most beautiful thing,

00:33:17.756 --> 00:33:22.057
is the most energy-giving. When you
love others only that the love flows into you.

00:33:22.257 --> 00:33:25.333
Otherwise, why should love come 
into you? If you are not giving the light,

00:33:25.533 --> 00:33:27.722
why should light come to you?

00:33:27.923 --> 00:33:30.069
Love others

00:33:33.209 --> 00:33:36.833
as you love thyself

00:33:37.389 --> 00:33:40.933
but here thyself love itself is destructive.

00:33:41.353 --> 00:33:44.200
Christ never knew there are people like that

00:33:50.006 --> 00:33:54.100
who are all the time destructive to themselves.

00:33:55.163 --> 00:34:01.467
There are, in so many lectures I’ve suggested 
what is the special problems of the West is,

00:34:04.106 --> 00:34:07.067
and one of them is left Vishuddhi,

00:34:08.113 --> 00:34:12.856
and if you go to the subtlest of subtlest
point where we are at Left Vishuddhi that

00:34:13.057 --> 00:34:16.500
we can always find out the injustice done to us

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:20.783
and to others but not what 
injustice we are doing to others.

00:34:23.216 --> 00:34:25.603
To avoid that we say that we are guilty of it

00:34:25.923 --> 00:34:28.100
Supposing I'm between My own child.

00:34:29.406 --> 00:34:34.273
Now I would take up the blame on upon Myself that
I am doing wrong to Myself but what I'll say is

00:34:34.859 --> 00:34:39.565
that the attention in Me, “What 
am I to do [UNCLEAR] is to understand?”

00:34:40.303 --> 00:34:43.170
or else what second thing 
I will do is to feel guilty.

00:34:43.370 --> 00:34:46.483
“Oh! I know. I know I 
should not but I'm [UNCLEAR]”

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:55.000
And in this small thing we can see

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:57.800
how we are deceiving our Self.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:04.600
The Self which is your
light, the Self which is your meaning,

00:35:05.213 --> 00:35:07.633
the Self that is Sat-chit-anand.

00:35:07.833 --> 00:35:12.500
That’s the one which is the 
Truth, which is the attention of God

00:35:13.156 --> 00:35:18.000
and which is the Joy, we are deceiving every...

00:35:19.223 --> 00:35:23.353
Better to be honest, face 
ourselves and put it right.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.720
May God bless you.
