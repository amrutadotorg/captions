00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.583
...the Hindu Scriptures, the experiences

00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:10.583
described in more detail than in Christian Scriptures.

00:00:10.792 --> 00:00:16.917
And we are told that you should be able to feel vibrations

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:21.208
emitting from the crown of your head once you have the awakening,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.333
like a cool wind, and you should also feel them on your hands.

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:32.875
And in Muslim Scriptures it's described as the Ruh.

00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:38.917
And Mohammed said, "I believe that at this time

00:00:39.083 --> 00:00:42.458
people would become enlightened and their hands would speak".

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:46.959
And once you have the experience of the awakening,

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:50.917
your fingers become sensitive to the vibrations

00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:55.583
in yourself and in other people and you can tell

00:00:55.792 --> 00:01:00.166
exactly what the condition of each person is and how their

00:01:00.417 --> 00:01:03.625
chakras are working or if there is a problem there.

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:08.709
And because the vibrations flow through,

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.000
through our hands and through our body

00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:15.500
and emit through our head, and

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:19.458
if you sit with your hands in this position,

00:01:19.917 --> 00:01:22.041
you'll probably start to feel

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.834
the awakening coming while Mother's talking.

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:33.125
And it's something that takes you beyond thought.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.583
You won't,

00:01:34.834 --> 00:01:37.667
you don't have to think about it or have a great intellectual

00:01:37.875 --> 00:01:40.250
understanding, to appreciate it.

00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:44.417
In fact children probably appreciate it more than rest of us

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.500
and always at first and because it is such a

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:52.125
true experience.

00:01:52.458 --> 00:01:57.417
So if you would just be receptive and

00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:00.959
not try and think of,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.166
worry about any words that seem a little bit

00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:06.583
different to what you are used to hearing,

00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:10.792
just enjoy the experience.Thank you.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.709
I won't keep you any longer.

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.291
Shri Mataji has arrived in Perth,

00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:25.750
from an, what is an extensive, overseas tour, and

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:28.792
I've been with Her now for the best part of two months and

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.375
we've been visiting many, many countries and

00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:35.208
at last She has come to my own country which is Australia.

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:38.709
Perth of course is the gateway to Australia and..

00:02:38.917 --> 00:02:40.875
I never see it, although I am from Sidney,

00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:43.250
I never see Sidney as the gateway.

00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:50.959
To me the West is where so much begins today.

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:53.667
There are so many seekers here.

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.542
Perth has very beautiful vibrations because we feel these vibrations

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.041
and Mataji Herself has commented what

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.750
beautiful seekers there are in this city.

00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:08.166
There is seeking in each one of us and

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:12.208
Linda has spoken very sweetly about that seeking, that

00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:15.667
that urge, that we want to be something higher,

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:19.000
that we want to achieve something beyond this

00:03:19.417 --> 00:03:22.500
human existence, the confusion  and the

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.000
frustration, that we face from time to time.

00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:31.917
Not only from time to time but probably most of our daily life.

00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:36.792
Shri Mataji is the One who can take you beyond this.

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:39.625
And She said "beyond thought", but

00:03:39.917 --> 00:03:43.041
the experience of Self-realisation is something

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.750
which you begin to perceive in your central nervous system.

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:53.750
You become an enlightened being and the process is one of growth,

00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:59.000
from that point onwards to the full experience of Self-realisation.

00:03:59.375 --> 00:04:01.834
It's an actualisation in other words.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.583
It's a spontaneous happening that occurs.

00:04:05.875 --> 00:04:09.166
She often says that on the tree of life

00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:12.375
at first there were just a few flowers

00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:17.542
that turned to fruit. Now it's the blossom time and the

00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:23.583
flowers are everywhere and all of them have to turn to fruit.

00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:29.083
This is what it is now and the grace of God is overflowing

00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:36.583
in such a way, that all of us can achieve that next step that,

00:04:36.834 --> 00:04:41.667
that last jump in our awareness.

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:46.166
We can become a spiritual being.

00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:49.875
We can be beyond thought and yet we can use thought.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.041
We can be beyond emotion and yet we can still enjoy,

00:04:55.417 --> 00:04:58.166
and feel emotion.

00:04:58.417 --> 00:05:00.875
In other words we become the Spirit.

00:05:01.083 --> 00:05:03.208
And this is the purpose of Mother's visit.

00:05:03.583 --> 00:05:07.083
We call Her Mother, Mataji means "the Divine Mother".

00:05:07.291 --> 00:05:09.999
She's known throughout the world as

00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:14.750
that being who has come on the earth to just do one job,

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:18.417
that is to awaken the subtle energy that lies

00:05:18.625 --> 00:05:23.917
in the sacrum, at the base of the spine. And when that energy rises,

00:05:24.166 --> 00:05:27.250
very sweetly and very painlessly,

00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:31.583
the actualisation of your second birth takes place.

00:05:31.792 --> 00:05:36.999
Christ has spoken about it as She said, Mohammed spoke about it.

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:40.875
All the great prophets and saints have spoken about it.

00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:44.625
And now the time has come. It seems too hard to believe,

00:05:44.834 --> 00:05:47.667
but this is what is happening to thousands of people.

00:05:48.041 --> 00:05:51.333
Already in Australia on the east coast,

00:05:51.583 --> 00:05:54.208
near the cities Sahaja Yoga is well established.

00:05:54.417 --> 00:05:56.542
I can see from the audience here that

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.208
it's going to be well established from now on in Perth.

00:06:00.417 --> 00:06:04.208
So without any further introduction from me,

00:06:04.458 --> 00:06:11.709
I'd like to introduce to you, Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:31.583
I think You are connected to the mains.

00:06:41.041 --> 00:06:45.041
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:06:48.166 --> 00:06:56.166
It's very nice to come back to Australia for the second time.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.750
And last time I could not come to Perth.

00:07:06.083 --> 00:07:10.041
I did not know that it was such a beautiful city,

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.959
with such beautiful, spiritual vibrations.

00:07:16.959 --> 00:07:24.417
What Linda has talked to you or Dr. Warren has told you,

00:07:24.667 --> 00:07:28.750
is the knowledge of the roots.

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:37.750
Now what we know through science or through our human senses,

00:07:38.709 --> 00:07:44.750
is the knowledge of the tree that we see obviously before us.

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:51.125
But this is the knowledge of the root

00:07:51.417 --> 00:07:56.667
and if you have to nourish

00:07:57.375 --> 00:08:02.417
the plant, you have to water the roots.

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:06.333
No use just plucking up some flowers,

00:08:06.542 --> 00:08:12.709
or some leaves and treating them with something artificial.

00:08:15.583 --> 00:08:20.083
This knowledge can only be achieved,

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:24.875
if you can somehow or other go to the roots.

00:08:25.166 --> 00:08:28.959
For example you are paying attention to Me just now.

00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:35.917
But if I say, " Please pay attention to yourself", you cannot do it.

00:08:36.375 --> 00:08:39.999
You say, "How Mother? How to do it?"

00:08:40.875 --> 00:08:43.250
So something has to happen within you,

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.917
which should attract your attention inside,

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:55.709
so that you can get your attention which is outside,

00:08:57.375 --> 00:09:00.750
in connection with the Spirit.

00:09:01.125 --> 00:09:06.375
And the attention then can be enlightened by the Spirit.

00:09:06.834 --> 00:09:10.166
So to know the knowledge of this root,

00:09:10.583 --> 00:09:16.917
you have to become something more than a human being.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.250
Even Darwin, who did not believe in God,

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:25.667
did say very clearly, that if man has come so far,

00:09:26.083 --> 00:09:32.667
he has to go little further to explain himself.

00:09:33.458 --> 00:09:38.917
But as he did not try the knowledge of the roots,

00:09:39.208 --> 00:09:46.125
whatever he said, was about what he saw apparently, outside.

00:09:49.458 --> 00:09:57.375
To become the subtle has to be something very spontaneous.

00:09:58.208 --> 00:10:01.667
Has to be something very spontaneous.

00:10:01.959 --> 00:10:07.125
It cannot be done by thinking or by reading.

00:10:07.542 --> 00:10:11.667
Some people believe, that if we read, we will go to God,

00:10:12.041 --> 00:10:15.333
or if we think about God, we'll go to God.

00:10:15.709 --> 00:10:19.917
It's not true. If it was so,

00:10:20.291 --> 00:10:23.792
why did Christ say that you are to be born again?

00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:26.250
Why did all of them say that

00:10:26.458 --> 00:10:29.375
some transformation has to take place within you?

00:10:29.792 --> 00:10:33.542
Even Buddha has said that you have to get your Self-realisation.

00:10:33.792 --> 00:10:38.458
Without that He would not talk about God.

00:10:38.792 --> 00:10:44.999
So something has to happen within us to transform us.

00:10:45.583 --> 00:10:49.792
The other idea people have, is - beg your pardon?

00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:51.625
Sorry, we have to leave early.

00:10:51.834 --> 00:10:55.999
All right, you come along tomorrow. All right? May God bless you.

00:10:59.834 --> 00:11:05.834
So something has to happen within us which is spontaneous.

00:11:06.166 --> 00:11:13.667
Because if our spiritual ascent has been

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:21.709
the result of a living process,

00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:28.959
the further movement has to be living again.

00:11:29.375 --> 00:11:34.875
So we have to understand first point, logically we should understand

00:11:35.208 --> 00:11:38.375
what we should expect about Self-realisation,

00:11:38.583 --> 00:11:41.792
that it has to be spontaneous.

00:11:42.166 --> 00:11:45.125
You cannot work it out,

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:52.291
you cannot become.

00:11:53.792 --> 00:11:56.959
You became human beings spontaneously,

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.709
from amoeba stage to this stage.

00:11:59.959 --> 00:12:04.041
And if you have to become something more it has to be

00:12:04.458 --> 00:12:08.709
spontaneous by the force which resides within you.

00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:14.417
Like the force that resides in a seed,

00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:20.291
which spontaneously becomes

00:12:20.667 --> 00:12:27.125
germinated when it is put in the Mother Earth.

00:12:27.542 --> 00:12:30.000
If you read a book, you cannot do it.

00:12:30.208 --> 00:12:32.542
If you stand on your head, you can't do it.

00:12:32.875 --> 00:12:36.125
If you jump, you do what you like, it's not going to happen.

00:12:36.375 --> 00:12:41.291
You have to put it in the womb of the Mother Earth,

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.208
so that the seed should be germinated.

00:12:44.417 --> 00:12:47.125
Is the capacity of the Mother Earth,

00:12:47.417 --> 00:12:49.625
is the quality of the Mother Earth,

00:12:49.834 --> 00:12:55.000
that gives that spontaneous germination to a seed.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:13:00.583
Now every day in life we see so many living things happening,

00:13:00.792 --> 00:13:06.709
like a flower becoming a fruit.

00:13:07.041 --> 00:13:10.166
But we take it for granted.

00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:15.999
We don't understand that we cannot transform a flower into a fruit.

00:13:16.291 --> 00:13:18.959
We cannot do anything that is living.

00:13:19.208 --> 00:13:21.792
What we can do is the dead work.

00:13:21.999 --> 00:13:26.333
If a tree dies, all right, so we make a beautiful furniture.

00:13:26.583 --> 00:13:31.041
Or something dead is converted into another form of dead,

00:13:31.417 --> 00:13:35.500
which also deaden us with habits.

00:13:35.999 --> 00:13:40.000
So the work of the Divine

00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:45.166
or the All Pervading Power of Love of God,

00:13:45.375 --> 00:13:49.250
is living work of the living God.

00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:53.417
And that power we know it exists

00:13:53.709 --> 00:13:55.834
but we are not aware of it

00:13:56.041 --> 00:14:00.999
and we cannot feel it on the central nervous system.

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:09.500
When people talk about the All Pervading Power, it's a mystery.

00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:13.375
They talk about the Holy Ghost. This is another mystery.

00:14:13.583 --> 00:14:15.542
Everything seems to be a mystery

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.041
before you have got your Realisation.

00:14:19.291 --> 00:14:21.959
For example this instrument is made

00:14:22.125 --> 00:14:26.250
and is not connected to the mains.

00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:28.999
It's a mystery. Nobody knows what is it for,

00:14:29.166 --> 00:14:31.792
what's the purpose of this instrument is.

00:14:31.999 --> 00:14:34.417
But once it is put to the mains,

00:14:34.625 --> 00:14:40.625
you start seeing how fantastic it is, how tremendous it is.

00:14:40.999 --> 00:14:45.166
One can't believe when they say that in Sahaja Yoga

00:14:45.375 --> 00:14:47.583
you receive all these powers of your own.

00:14:47.875 --> 00:14:52.333
One can't believe it, because they think, "How can it be possible?"

00:14:52.667 --> 00:14:57.875
But for your information, you are a fantastic being made by God.

00:14:58.125 --> 00:14:59.834
And this is the instrument,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.542
that is lying within you in a subtle form.

00:15:03.999 --> 00:15:08.166
Now when I'm talking to you, you have to know one more thing,

00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:12.250
that you should keep an open mind to listen to Me,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.583
like a scientist does.

00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:19.834
It's a hypothesis for you and it's truth for Me.

00:15:20.041 --> 00:15:23.083
All right. If it is proofed to be truth for you

00:15:23.375 --> 00:15:28.417
then you should go forward with it and try to understand,

00:15:28.625 --> 00:15:36.250
how the truth is being established  logically within you.

00:15:36.917 --> 00:15:42.333
At the very outset I've seen people have doubts about the Divine.

00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:45.208
They start asking, "Mother how is it possible,

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:47.834
that we can get it so easily?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.542
How one can get realisation so easily?

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.333
We have to cleanse it, we have to suffer, we have to do this."

00:15:55.667 --> 00:16:03.417
Perhaps you do not know, that when we use an electric switch,

00:16:04.041 --> 00:16:09.250
we do not think, what has gone in the history,

00:16:09.542 --> 00:16:12.041
what people have suffered in the history

00:16:12.375 --> 00:16:16.250
in creating that little switch.

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:21.667
It has taken ages for this switch to come up,

00:16:21.875 --> 00:16:27.250
to discover the electricity, the working of it and the whole, whole

00:16:27.458 --> 00:16:31.834
development of electrical appliances, till we got the switch.

00:16:32.083 --> 00:16:36.500
Now we only know we have to switch on and we get the lights.

00:16:36.917 --> 00:16:40.250
But when I say that you don't have to do anything else,

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:41.542
you are not to suffer,

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:46.166
you must know somebody has suffered for you on the cross.

00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:49.959
Somebody has done the cleansing part of it,

00:16:50.166 --> 00:16:56.542
and you cannot cleanse yourself unless and until you are out of it.

00:16:57.291 --> 00:17:01.999
If you have to cleanse your car, you have to get out of it.

00:17:02.625 --> 00:17:06.959
That is why first of all you must get your Self-realisation,

00:17:07.166 --> 00:17:14.542
the light of your being, the purpose of your life, the absolute.

00:17:14.792 --> 00:17:17.709
She has already explained to you the chart,

00:17:17.999 --> 00:17:23.000
that is the instrument, the subtle instrument that is within you.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:27.291
Now here the chart is showing you all the different centers,

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:34.667
but these centers are manifested also in the gross as plexuses.

00:17:35.041 --> 00:17:39.000
We have first of all the Mooladhara chakra.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:45.125
This chakra is the center which controls actually the pelvic plexus,

00:17:45.417 --> 00:17:48.999
through which all our excretion takes place.

00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:52.500
It's a very important center, Mooladhara,

00:17:52.709 --> 00:17:55.667
means the support of the root.

00:17:55.917 --> 00:17:58.792
Is the support of the root, is the center

00:17:58.999 --> 00:18:01.959
of the support of the root.

00:18:02.166 --> 00:18:05.291
Is a very, very important center, because

00:18:05.542 --> 00:18:09.333
this represents our innocence.

00:18:09.709 --> 00:18:13.375
In the subtle it is the innocence in us,

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:18.250
which looks after this center.

00:18:18.792 --> 00:18:23.291
Through our ignorance or through our naiveness,

00:18:23.542 --> 00:18:25.375
we loose our innocence.

00:18:25.709 --> 00:18:28.166
But actually innocence can never be lost,

00:18:28.375 --> 00:18:34.667
only it is tarnished or covered by our stupidity maybe,

00:18:34.875 --> 00:18:37.417
by our wrong doings to ourselves.

00:18:37.667 --> 00:18:39.792
It exists all the time,

00:18:39.999 --> 00:18:43.291
and when the Kundalini rises which is above that,

00:18:43.667 --> 00:18:47.250
which is coiled up into three and a half coils,

00:18:47.458 --> 00:18:50.291
this chakra becomes aware of itself.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:54.792
The deity of innocence within it gets awakened

00:18:54.999 --> 00:19:01.625
and one starts feeling the innocence within one's personality.

00:19:02.041 --> 00:19:07.291
The Kundalini itself, this residual power of desire,

00:19:07.625 --> 00:19:10.417
is placed in the triangular bone.

00:19:10.709 --> 00:19:15.500
The triangular bone is the bone called as sacrum.

00:19:15.834 --> 00:19:18.333
It's a Greek word, meaning sacred.

00:19:18.583 --> 00:19:22.959
So the Greek knew that this

00:19:23.375 --> 00:19:26.291
triangular bone contained something sacred.

00:19:26.542 --> 00:19:28.291
And when I went to Greece and asked them,

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.125
"How is it you call it sacrum?",

00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:34.458
they said, "There has been a report, Indo-Aryan report,

00:19:34.667 --> 00:19:38.625
much before Alexander, where we came to know about this bone,

00:19:38.875 --> 00:19:44.542
that it is a sacred bone and it has a special power within it."

00:19:44.875 --> 00:19:50.083
Now this Kundalini is a power which is the pure desire,

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:53.125
is the power of pure desire.

00:19:53.333 --> 00:19:56.417
While the other, if you see the blue line,

00:19:56.709 --> 00:20:00.375
the left side power within us,

00:20:00.583 --> 00:20:04.999
which starts from the right at the back and goes to the left,

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:09.083
is the power of desire.

00:20:09.375 --> 00:20:14.375
But not pure desire, because this can be made impured.

00:20:14.625 --> 00:20:20.875
And all other desires but the desire to be one with the Divine,

00:20:21.041 --> 00:20:25.875
are corruptible, can be wrong, can be confusing.

00:20:26.125 --> 00:20:30.291
As you know in economics it is said, that

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.375
no desire is satiable in general,

00:20:33.583 --> 00:20:35.709
because you want to buy a house, you want to buy a car,

00:20:35.917 --> 00:20:38.250
then you want to buy that and you buy another thing.

00:20:38.458 --> 00:20:40.834
You are never satisfied with matter.

00:20:41.166 --> 00:20:45.333
So this desire which is lying in the sacrum bone

00:20:45.542 --> 00:20:47.709
absolutely in its pure form,

00:20:47.999 --> 00:20:50.792
the pure desire to be one with the Divine,

00:20:50.999 --> 00:20:56.208
is the one that gives you ultimate satisfaction and joy.

00:20:56.709 --> 00:21:00.667
It is so spontaneous, that if people ask Me, "How You do it?",

00:21:00.875 --> 00:21:05.125
is going to be difficult to explain at this level how it is done.

00:21:05.458 --> 00:21:08.959
As you cannot explain how a seed germinates

00:21:09.208 --> 00:21:11.083
and how it becomes a tree.

00:21:11.291 --> 00:21:13.709
All living things cannot be explained,

00:21:13.917 --> 00:21:18.834
only to be seen and to be felt within yourself.

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:24.333
I will be able to tell you tomorrow more about these centers,

00:21:24.542 --> 00:21:27.333
what are these centers and what are they related to you.

00:21:27.625 --> 00:21:30.083
In any case I hope you have the books now and

00:21:30.291 --> 00:21:35.583
when you go, you can take these books with you and read them at home

00:21:35.792 --> 00:21:39.208
and see for yourself, if you can understand,

00:21:39.417 --> 00:21:41.208
what's written in those books.

00:21:41.458 --> 00:21:45.250
But here today as an introduction, I would like to tell you

00:21:45.458 --> 00:21:48.250
certain questions all these people have in their mind.

00:21:48.458 --> 00:21:52.583
For example there have been many fake gurus coming from India

00:21:52.875 --> 00:21:55.959
and they have been enticing many people abroad.

00:21:56.166 --> 00:21:59.291
And most of the newspaper people ask Me about them.

00:21:59.542 --> 00:22:05.750
So I have to tell that you of course can blame these fake gurus,

00:22:05.959 --> 00:22:08.709
no doubt, that they are sinister, they have been devilish,

00:22:08.959 --> 00:22:10.959
they have been money oriented, I agree.

00:22:11.125 --> 00:22:15.250
But also that a seeker has to use his brains

00:22:15.583 --> 00:22:17.999
and must understand, what he is seeking.

00:22:18.208 --> 00:22:22.959
If we just blind folded go to these gurus, then

00:22:23.166 --> 00:22:27.250
what can one do about it? It's very sad, because they are so naive,

00:22:27.458 --> 00:22:31.125
they must understand what we are seeking, what we are expecting,

00:22:31.333 --> 00:22:34.583
and what should happen to us.

00:22:36.125 --> 00:22:44.125
Now, some people don't understand that you cannot pay for God.

00:22:45.458 --> 00:22:48.667
You have not paid anything for becoming a human being.

00:22:48.959 --> 00:22:50.333
He doesn't understand money.

00:22:50.583 --> 00:22:53.166
Money is created only by human beings.

00:22:53.417 --> 00:22:57.000
God has not created money. He doesn't understand money at all.

00:22:57.208 --> 00:23:01.375
You cannot purchase God, you cannot purchase this knowledge,

00:23:01.625 --> 00:23:03.583
you cannot purchase your realisation.

00:23:03.792 --> 00:23:06.500
None of the things that are related with God,

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.834
can be purchased with money.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.166
Anybody who tries to take money from you,

00:23:12.375 --> 00:23:14.458
in the name of God, is a parasite.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:20.000
Not only a parasite,

00:23:20.375 --> 00:23:26.333
but I would say a person who is anti-God.

00:23:26.625 --> 00:23:30.417
Because that is how he is maligning the name of God.

00:23:30.834 --> 00:23:36.959
It cannot be purchased, it cannot be sold, it cannot be organised,

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:38.999
it cannot be manoeuvred.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:43.625
We cannot have aa organisation of God.

00:23:43.834 --> 00:23:48.333
We cannot organise Him. He is the way He is.

00:23:48.583 --> 00:23:51.875
We cannot tell Him now, "You come along every Sunday to our church".

00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:56.333
He won't. It is His desire, if He wants to do it

00:23:56.667 --> 00:23:58.333
or if He doesn't want to do it.

00:23:58.542 --> 00:24:04.750
The only thing that binds God is love, dedication and truthfulness.

00:24:04.959 --> 00:24:07.625
If you are truthful, if you are dedicated,

00:24:07.834 --> 00:24:09.583
then God is interested in you.

00:24:09.834 --> 00:24:13.208
If you are not, He is not at all interested in people,

00:24:13.417 --> 00:24:17.125
who are seeking not God but something else.

00:24:17.417 --> 00:24:21.999
But what is most unfortunate, that the people who are mislaid,

00:24:22.166 --> 00:24:24.542
are all seekers of God.

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.875
They are all seekers of truth, they are true people,

00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:31.999
they are honest, they are dedicated and they are exploited.

00:24:32.166 --> 00:24:36.875
So again I would say, anybody who takes money in the name of God,

00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:40.250
please see that, that is not God, please!

00:24:40.458 --> 00:24:43.375
As a Mother I'm warning you, that one has to understand,

00:24:43.583 --> 00:24:47.667
any saint who takes money in the name of God is

00:24:47.875 --> 00:24:52.999
not a person, who is to be regarded as a divine personality,

00:24:53.333 --> 00:24:55.250
by no chance a saint.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.041
Now secondly, as I told you, you cannot put in an effort,

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:01.834
it is a spontaneous happening.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.083
Now one of the arguments people have, that in such and such book,

00:25:06.291 --> 00:25:08.500
X, Y, Z this is written.

00:25:08.709 --> 00:25:12.667
In the other book so and so, this is written.

00:25:12.999 --> 00:25:17.999
Another fellow who was such and such has said so.

00:25:18.291 --> 00:25:23.000
It's very easy to dwell upon such sayings and on such books.

00:25:23.291 --> 00:25:28.250
I would request you to be here at this moment with Me,

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.500
to understand what I have to say.

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:31.959
If you bring in other people,

00:25:32.125 --> 00:25:34.375
I'll have to tell you the facts about them,

00:25:34.583 --> 00:25:36.917
which you may not like, which will not be palatable.

00:25:37.125 --> 00:25:39.250
We'll create a controversy for nothing at all.

00:25:39.458 --> 00:25:42.625
Because we are not here to create any controversies.

00:25:42.917 --> 00:25:45.750
We are here to achieve our goal of Self-realisation

00:25:45.959 --> 00:25:47.959
for our betterment.

00:25:48.333 --> 00:25:52.959
Once you understand this, that the main interest is of the Divine

00:25:53.125 --> 00:25:58.083
and that is, that you all should get your Self-realisation.

00:25:58.458 --> 00:26:01.375
We have known that we have become human beings.

00:26:01.583 --> 00:26:04.792
But we have never asked a question, no scientist has asked a question:

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.333
Why have we become a human being?

00:26:07.583 --> 00:26:09.875
Why are we on this earth moving

00:26:10.041 --> 00:26:12.166
with these two legs and two feet in this fashion?

00:26:12.375 --> 00:26:16.542
What is the speciality, why God has made us

00:26:16.834 --> 00:26:20.166
in such a beautiful way, that we are called as human beings?

00:26:20.375 --> 00:26:23.417
If you ask this question to yourself, you won't be able to say

00:26:23.625 --> 00:26:27.417
that there is any purpose in what God has done to us.

00:26:27.625 --> 00:26:29.500
But I say, there is a purpose!

00:26:29.709 --> 00:26:33.083
The purpose is that you have to become the instrument of God.

00:26:33.375 --> 00:26:39.417
You have to become the carrier of His power.

00:26:39.792 --> 00:26:44.999
When the Kundalini rises and breaks through your seventh chakra here,

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:48.709
then it is amazing how you feel this All Pervading Power

00:26:48.917 --> 00:26:52.083
as cool breeze in your hands. But that's not sufficient.

00:26:52.291 --> 00:26:54.959
If you feel the cool breeze, supposing I give you a car

00:26:55.125 --> 00:27:00.208
or any instrument and I don't tell you how to drive, it is useless.

00:27:00.458 --> 00:27:04.667
But if you learn the complete decoding of this feeling

00:27:04.875 --> 00:27:09.750
of this All Pervading Power, you can do great things,

00:27:09.999 --> 00:27:12.375
because God has put these powers within you,

00:27:12.583 --> 00:27:15.000
only the light has to come in.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:17.999
Without the light as you cannot see anything properly,

00:27:18.166 --> 00:27:20.792
you cannot integrate anything, correlate anything.

00:27:20.999 --> 00:27:24.792
In the same way, when there is no light within yourself,

00:27:24.999 --> 00:27:31.417
you are not integrated within, nor you understand absolute things.

00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:34.417
What you understand are relative things.

00:27:34.625 --> 00:27:38.250
With our mind projection whatever we do is all relative.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:42.125
That's why we are having problems about our politics,

00:27:42.333 --> 00:27:47.999
about our economics, about our every sort of thing that we are doing.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:53.041
Our development also has been very one-sided in the sense,

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.999
that our material development has taken place

00:27:56.166 --> 00:27:58.166
without the Spirit in it.

00:27:58.417 --> 00:28:01.750
Anything without the Spirit is something like a tree

00:28:01.959 --> 00:28:06.458
growing, outgrowing it's size much more than the roots

00:28:06.667 --> 00:28:11.208
and that's how sometimes we always are worried and shocked

00:28:11.458 --> 00:28:17.250
at the destruction, that is facing us from within and without.

00:28:17.458 --> 00:28:21.166
We see diseases like cancer and other horrible diseases,

00:28:21.417 --> 00:28:22.875
which we cannot combat.

00:28:23.041 --> 00:28:28.333
We see the problems of the nations and political, economic crises,

00:28:28.583 --> 00:28:32.667
and we don't understand how to control it on individual basis.

00:28:32.917 --> 00:28:37.291
All these things can only be solved if you become the Spirit.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.375
The Spirit is within you the link with the whole.

00:28:42.667 --> 00:28:46.999
Like the microcosm, the whole, you are a part and parcel of that.

00:28:47.166 --> 00:28:49.709
Like my finger is part and parcel of the whole.

00:28:49.959 --> 00:28:54.000
Now, if there is pain in my finger, I can feel the whole.

00:28:54.208 --> 00:28:57.291
In the same way once I become aware of My Spirit,

00:28:57.542 --> 00:29:01.417
I can feel the whole, I become collectively conscious.

00:29:01.625 --> 00:29:04.792
I do not talk about it, I do not say that

00:29:04.999 --> 00:29:08.542
'You are now brothers and sisters', but it just happens that

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:12.375
on your fingertips you start feeling others, very clearly,

00:29:12.583 --> 00:29:15.041
their centres, their problems, your problems

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:19.250
and also you know methods how to clear it out.

00:29:19.458 --> 00:29:22.208
Compassion people talk of, of giving compassion,

00:29:22.417 --> 00:29:24.834
looking after people and doing good to them.

00:29:25.083 --> 00:29:29.208
But this compassion talks, it doesn't solve the problem.

00:29:29.417 --> 00:29:33.458
But the compassion that flows from you, works. It works out.

00:29:33.709 --> 00:29:37.709
It helps people in a way that they are not aware of it.

00:29:37.917 --> 00:29:40.917
For example in India we had one Indian,

00:29:41.083 --> 00:29:42.750
who got realisation in a village.

00:29:42.959 --> 00:29:45.000
He was a farmer, he went back,

00:29:45.208 --> 00:29:49.583
and he gave realisation to so many people, and it is unbelievable,

00:29:49.792 --> 00:29:56.291
how he could manage such a lot of population to come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:56.542 --> 00:29:58.667
But he told Me that certain incidents

00:29:58.875 --> 00:30:05.083
like, 'A man came to me and he was an alcoholic,

00:30:05.417 --> 00:30:08.417
and he came to me and he was about to beat me.

00:30:08.667 --> 00:30:10.875
But I was very quiet. I just told him,

00:30:11.041 --> 00:30:13.125
"Now don't beat me, you sit down for a while".

00:30:13.375 --> 00:30:17.041
He sat down and after some time, I awakened his Kundalini.

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:19.917
Overnight he gave up alcohol!

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:21.792
Overnight he gave it up.

00:30:21.999 --> 00:30:23.875
He became like a king. He said, "What?

00:30:24.041 --> 00:30:25.750
I'm not going to drink anymore".'

00:30:25.959 --> 00:30:31.375
It's not mental, but just he achieved his supreme thing,

00:30:31.709 --> 00:30:38.500
the highest thing, his purpose and the whole being got glorified.

00:30:38.709 --> 00:30:42.333
So you start feeling your own powers.

00:30:42.542 --> 00:30:45.875
Actually when you go to any guru, you must also find out

00:30:46.041 --> 00:30:49.959
from the disciples, if they have achieved any powers or not.

00:30:50.125 --> 00:30:52.834
It is not important if a guru says, "I am such and such".

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.709
For example, the lady who came to interview Me, she said,

00:30:57.917 --> 00:31:01.208
"Do You think you are the highest saint of India?" and all that.

00:31:01.417 --> 00:31:05.417
I said, "I never said so. But the saints in India do say so."

00:31:05.625 --> 00:31:08.291
All right. If you believe in it or not makes no difference.

00:31:08.542 --> 00:31:11.291
It is for you to find out. But leave alone Me,

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.417
why not find out about yourself, what happens to you.

00:31:14.625 --> 00:31:19.208
Supposing you become the saint, supposing you have the powers,

00:31:19.417 --> 00:31:22.375
supposing you manifest that compassion which I am talking of,

00:31:22.583 --> 00:31:25.792
then you have to believe that there is something about yourself.

00:31:25.999 --> 00:31:28.500
First of all you all must have faith in yourselves,

00:31:28.709 --> 00:31:32.417
that you are capable of becoming that Self,

00:31:32.625 --> 00:31:36.291
which is collectively conscious to begin with,

00:31:36.667 --> 00:31:41.917
which is the source of all the joy, health, wealth

00:31:42.083 --> 00:31:44.834
and all kinds of satisfaction,

00:31:45.083 --> 00:31:49.458
and the one which is the witness of the play of Divine,

00:31:49.667 --> 00:31:55.750
the one that allows you to transmit this Divine power to others.

00:31:55.999 --> 00:31:59.250
After realisation, for example Dr. Warren himself

00:31:59.542 --> 00:32:01.750
was very reluctant in the beginning.

00:32:01.959 --> 00:32:04.208
He was a difficult person to begin with.

00:32:04.417 --> 00:32:06.083
Then he got his realisation

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:09.125
and after realisation he was quite satisfied.

00:32:09.333 --> 00:32:11.125
Because he had been to so many gurus.

00:32:11.333 --> 00:32:13.125
There's no guru he had not been.

00:32:13.333 --> 00:32:20.166
And he was so angry and aggressive when he came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:20.417 --> 00:32:25.458
When he got into realisation, he just felt that he has found it.

00:32:25.709 --> 00:32:29.625
Now, through him in Australia we have established

00:32:29.834 --> 00:32:33.166
so many centres, and so many people have got realisation.

00:32:33.375 --> 00:32:35.959
It's a surprising thing that one man,

00:32:36.125 --> 00:32:40.041
who reluctantly came to Me on a telephone number,

00:32:40.333 --> 00:32:43.834
has suddenly become such an enlightened person,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.625
that he has given realisation to so many people,

00:32:47.917 --> 00:32:50.917
and to whom he has given realisation, have

00:32:51.083 --> 00:32:53.750
also given Realisation to so many others.

00:32:53.959 --> 00:32:57.875
Apart from that they have cured diseases like cancer

00:32:58.041 --> 00:33:02.542
and all kinds of serious diseases we talk about. It's a fact.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:06.250
For this you cannot pay. That's one thing for sure.

00:33:06.458 --> 00:33:08.458
You cannot pay for it. It's all free.

00:33:08.667 --> 00:33:11.999
As this nature is free to give you everything

00:33:12.166 --> 00:33:14.792
that is essential and vital within you.

00:33:14.999 --> 00:33:20.125
In the same way this knowledge has to be without any effort.

00:33:20.375 --> 00:33:24.083
Supposing if we have to learn about breathing,

00:33:24.291 --> 00:33:28.083
going to a library, how many of us would survive?

00:33:28.333 --> 00:33:32.083
It is so vital that it has to be the easiest, the simplest

00:33:32.291 --> 00:33:35.250
and everything that is living is so simple,

00:33:35.458 --> 00:33:39.250
that we don't also bother to think about it.

00:33:39.458 --> 00:33:43.500
We take all this for granted.

00:33:44.333 --> 00:33:47.667
The subject is very wide.

00:33:47.999 --> 00:33:50.500
It has many aspects and dimensions.

00:33:50.709 --> 00:33:55.041
First when the Kundalini rises, it crosses through this center,

00:33:55.291 --> 00:33:57.792
which is called as the Agnya chakra,

00:33:57.999 --> 00:34:02.583
which is the chakra of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:34:02.792 --> 00:34:05.291
Tomorrow I'll be telling you the names of all the deities,

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.500
who reside on these centers.

00:34:07.709 --> 00:34:10.125
Now it is difficult for a scientist to accept,

00:34:10.333 --> 00:34:14.375
that there are deities who are sitting on these chakras.

00:34:14.583 --> 00:34:18.792
But Socrates and Confucius who were such ancient people,

00:34:18.999 --> 00:34:22.792
have talked about these Gods, that we have to keep them pleased

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.875
and you have to keep them all right.

00:34:25.041 --> 00:34:27.583
But those realised souls perhaps you don't know.

00:34:27.792 --> 00:34:32.375
That's not easy to convince human beings who are not realised souls

00:34:32.583 --> 00:34:37.000
about these deities being within you.

00:34:37.333 --> 00:34:40.041
And they are all just waiting there.

00:34:40.291 --> 00:34:45.792
As soon as the Kundalini rises you start manifesting your grandeur,

00:34:45.999 --> 00:34:48.917
your great personality that awaits you.

00:34:49.125 --> 00:34:52.667
This is something not fantastic to Me,

00:34:52.875 --> 00:34:56.917
because I've seen thousands of people getting realisation,

00:34:57.125 --> 00:34:59.709
thousands of them feeling the cool breeze,

00:34:59.999 --> 00:35:02.458
thousands of them transforming.

00:35:02.709 --> 00:35:05.709
Another thing one has to see in a person, in a guru,

00:35:05.917 --> 00:35:08.041
when you go to a guru, that

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:12.000
'Is this the man giving any transformation to another person?'

00:35:12.208 --> 00:35:15.417
Here they are, they are smuggling, they are telling lies,

00:35:15.625 --> 00:35:17.583
they are killing people and they have a guru.

00:35:17.792 --> 00:35:18.875
How can you have a guru,

00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:22.166
when you are doing all these anti-God activities?

00:35:22.375 --> 00:35:24.458
All kinds of anti-God activities they are doing:

00:35:24.667 --> 00:35:30.208
They are hot-tempered, they are liars, they are intriguers,

00:35:30.458 --> 00:35:32.750
all sorts of things they'll be doing

00:35:32.959 --> 00:35:35.792
and they will be saying that "We have a guru".

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.875
What's the use of such a guru, who allows you to do these things?

00:35:39.041 --> 00:35:41.834
It's better not to have such a guru who allows you to do that.

00:35:42.041 --> 00:35:44.875
Secondly, a guru if you have a real one,

00:35:45.041 --> 00:35:48.000
he has to look after your health, minimum of minimum.

00:35:48.208 --> 00:35:51.375
But if you go to a guru and if you get epilepsy

00:35:51.583 --> 00:35:54.709
or if you go to a guru and you get a bad head

00:35:54.917 --> 00:35:57.166
or some sort of a headache, then he says,

00:35:57.375 --> 00:36:00.041
"All right, these are your sins, you better suffer".

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:02.125
So one should ask a question to such a guru,

00:36:02.333 --> 00:36:06.583
that, "Then why are you there? Why are we paying you for?

00:36:06.792 --> 00:36:10.208
If you can't even look after our health,what are we paying you for?"

00:36:10.417 --> 00:36:13.291
There could be a guru who can teach you something,

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.542
like he'll say that, "I'll make you fly".

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.875
So you must ask the guru to fly himself.

00:36:18.083 --> 00:36:20.166
If the guru can fly, then you pay him.

00:36:20.375 --> 00:36:22.959
What's the use of paying a guru who just says, you can fly.

00:36:23.125 --> 00:36:25.834
"All right, you give me six thousand pounds, I'll make you fly."

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.917
Better ask the guru to fly and see that he flies.

00:36:29.083 --> 00:36:31.542
But people are so identified with the gurus,

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:35.583
that despite they become absolutely bankrupt, finished,

00:36:35.792 --> 00:36:38.709
gone cases, still they are sticking on to these gurus,

00:36:38.999 --> 00:36:40.000
because they are mesmerised.

00:36:40.208 --> 00:36:43.000
They don't want to have their own Self-realisation,

00:36:43.208 --> 00:36:45.250
they don't want to have their own powers,

00:36:45.458 --> 00:36:48.875
but they want to abide by the so-called powers of their guru

00:36:49.041 --> 00:36:52.750
and all these things. They become absolutely hopeless cases,

00:36:52.999 --> 00:36:55.917
gone cases, good for nothing, lost people,

00:36:56.083 --> 00:36:59.250
but still they'll stick on to these people and

00:36:59.458 --> 00:37:03.417
will continue with it till they are perished as useless cabbages.

00:37:03.667 --> 00:37:06.667
It's a very common thing, I've seen of some of the people

00:37:06.875 --> 00:37:09.375
who teach that you must starve now, you must starve.

00:37:09.583 --> 00:37:10.792
And the guru eats well,

00:37:10.999 --> 00:37:13.583
but all the disciples are starving and suffering.

00:37:13.792 --> 00:37:15.333
There's one thing more in Sahaja Yoga,

00:37:15.542 --> 00:37:17.667
you are not supposed to suffer anymore.

00:37:17.999 --> 00:37:21.166
There's no need to suffer.

00:37:22.208 --> 00:37:24.625
Christ has suffered. He has suffered for us.

00:37:24.875 --> 00:37:27.834
Now, no more suffering is needed for anyone of you.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.583
Tomorrow I'll tell you how, when Christ is awakened,

00:37:31.875 --> 00:37:34.083
you can feel

00:37:34.333 --> 00:37:37.709
your so-called karmas and your so-called

00:37:37.917 --> 00:37:40.166
egos and all that just are sucked in.

00:37:40.375 --> 00:37:46.041
Here as you will see, ego is created with this right side power

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:51.458
called as the kriya shakti, is the power of action.

00:37:51.834 --> 00:37:55.792
And when it moves further and further and touches the other side

00:37:55.999 --> 00:37:58.458
which is the superego, then

00:37:58.667 --> 00:38:01.500
in the center here, on the fontanel bone area,

00:38:01.709 --> 00:38:03.750
a calcification takes place.

00:38:03.959 --> 00:38:07.041
And when that happens you develop your I-ness.

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:12.667
You become "I", Mr." I", Mr."Second I", Mr. "Third I".

00:38:12.917 --> 00:38:16.458
Now, this is like an egg we can say,

00:38:16.667 --> 00:38:18.999
which has to be transformed into a bird.

00:38:19.166 --> 00:38:24.208
In Sanskrit a realised soul is called as 'vijaha', means twice born.

00:38:24.458 --> 00:38:27.625
And also a bird is called as twice-born.

00:38:27.834 --> 00:38:32.875
In the same way a human being which looks so insipid, so boring,

00:38:33.041 --> 00:38:36.250
so useless, sometimes he also condemns himself for nothing at all,

00:38:36.458 --> 00:38:39.667
sometimes you find him so bombastic, so egoistical,

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:42.417
so horrible, so aggressive.

00:38:42.625 --> 00:38:45.583
All these people are nothing but these little eggs.

00:38:45.792 --> 00:38:51.000
Only thing what one has to do is to transform them into the bird.

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:53.999
The bird, that is a free bird,

00:38:54.208 --> 00:38:57.834
which understands what is wrong with you,

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.417
what is wrong with others and how to correct yourself.

00:39:01.667 --> 00:39:04.999
Because the Spirit is the master, is the guru.

00:39:05.166 --> 00:39:08.792
Your Spirit is your master. You are your own master.

00:39:08.999 --> 00:39:10.834
You become your own master

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.542
and you start understanding everything one by one.

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:17.125
I am just your Mother. I'll decode for you,

00:39:17.333 --> 00:39:19.875
I'll tell you what is what, what is this.

00:39:20.041 --> 00:39:24.166
Once you understand that and you start finding it out,

00:39:24.375 --> 00:39:26.458
you yourself will be amazed, that

00:39:26.667 --> 00:39:28.750
not only that you can cure yourself,

00:39:28.959 --> 00:39:30.500
you can raise your own Kundalini,

00:39:30.709 --> 00:39:32.542
you can work it out on yourself

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:35.583
and keep your transformation moving further and further,

00:39:35.792 --> 00:39:40.000
but you become entitled, endowed with powers,

00:39:40.208 --> 00:39:42.417
that you can give realisations to others,

00:39:42.625 --> 00:39:45.709
you can do all these things by yourself,

00:39:45.959 --> 00:39:48.875
and it is such a remarkable thing, which must be achieved.

00:39:49.041 --> 00:39:52.792
Because if you see the condition of this world today,

00:39:52.999 --> 00:39:54.375
it is in a very big mess.

00:39:54.583 --> 00:39:58.458
I don't know if people understand it what we are facing.

00:39:58.667 --> 00:40:02.875
We are just like the tree as I told you, which has lost his roots,

00:40:03.041 --> 00:40:05.709
and anytime it can be destroyed.

00:40:05.959 --> 00:40:09.834
It is very important today that all of us must seek

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.458
and find the Spirit.

00:40:12.709 --> 00:40:16.250
Everybody who has told this, they were not liars,

00:40:16.458 --> 00:40:18.250
they are not telling us wrong things.

00:40:18.458 --> 00:40:21.458
Traditionally everyone has said the same thing.

00:40:21.667 --> 00:40:25.166
Now these gurus can also start some untraditional stuff,

00:40:25.375 --> 00:40:28.333
and people believe it, because it is something new.

00:40:28.583 --> 00:40:32.083
This is the higher evolution of a person

00:40:32.291 --> 00:40:35.375
where you arrive at a point,

00:40:35.583 --> 00:40:40.041
where you become the witness of the play of the whole game.

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:42.709
For example a thought rises and falls off,

00:40:42.917 --> 00:40:44.999
another thought rises and falls off.

00:40:45.166 --> 00:40:47.625
Between these thoughts there is a little space

00:40:47.834 --> 00:40:49.917
and this space is the present,

00:40:50.083 --> 00:40:53.333
while we live in the present or the past.

00:40:53.542 --> 00:40:59.999
But - we live in the present, we don't live in the present,

00:41:00.208 --> 00:41:02.625
but we live in the future or in the past.

00:41:02.834 --> 00:41:05.709
Now the past doesn't exist, because it's over,

00:41:05.917 --> 00:41:07.625
and the present (should be FUTURE) doesn't exist at all.

00:41:07.834 --> 00:41:10.792
So our thoughts are all the time moving like that.

00:41:10.999 --> 00:41:16.125
If somehow you can stop yourself at the point that is the present,

00:41:16.583 --> 00:41:21.959
then you start enjoying the dynamics of every moment which you live.

00:41:22.208 --> 00:41:25.542
And that's what is achieved through Kundalini awakening.

00:41:25.792 --> 00:41:28.709
As I told you this subject matter is very great.

00:41:28.917 --> 00:41:33.959
In an introduction I have tried to cover lots of points,

00:41:34.125 --> 00:41:37.041
which people have been asking Me all over the world.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:39.333
And if you have any new points to ask Me,

00:41:39.542 --> 00:41:41.959
I'll be very happy to answer you.

00:41:42.125 --> 00:41:44.000
Tomorrow I'll tell you actually

00:41:44.208 --> 00:41:46.500
what happens, when the Kundalini rises.

00:41:46.709 --> 00:41:49.083
I would like you to
ask Me questions

00:41:49.291 --> 00:41:53.083
and after that we will have the session of realisation,

00:41:53.291 --> 00:41:55.792
which may take hardly ten to fifteen minutes.

00:41:56.083 --> 00:41:58.875
May God bless you all.

00:41:59.667 --> 00:42:03.709
Can I have questions from you?

00:42:18.291 --> 00:42:21.125
You have a question? Anyone with questions...

00:42:21.458 --> 00:42:24.709
This is the best way to openly talk.

00:42:25.041 --> 00:42:28.750
Did You say the mind is the Spirit?

00:42:28.999 --> 00:42:30.875
Did You say the mind is the Spirit?

00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:33.417
No, tomorrow I'll tell you the difference,

00:42:33.625 --> 00:42:38.750
but if you want I tell you mind and Spirit are two different things.

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:47.083
In English language what we call mind it's a confusing thing.

00:42:47.291 --> 00:42:51.458
But it's simple to understand.

00:42:52.041 --> 00:42:57.208
Now here you see is an institution,

00:42:57.458 --> 00:43:02.375
which looks like a blue balloon in the head.

00:43:02.625 --> 00:43:05.625
That is the mind.

00:43:05.999 --> 00:43:12.917
It is created by the action of the power of desire.

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:16.959
which we call in psychology as superego,

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:20.999
which is the result of all our conditionings, is the mind.

00:43:21.208 --> 00:43:24.625
You can call it manasa. In Sanskrit language is manasa.

00:43:24.834 --> 00:43:30.917
Now on the right side, the yellow coloured line, you see,

00:43:31.083 --> 00:43:35.709
ends up into another yellow coloured institution,

00:43:35.917 --> 00:43:42.041
is a result or a by-product of our activity,

00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:48.667
physical and through our brain, which we call as mental.

00:43:48.917 --> 00:43:53.125
This creates an institution called ego.

00:43:53.458 --> 00:43:57.166
So we have got superego as well as ego.

00:43:57.417 --> 00:44:00.291
Supposing you tell somebody, "Don't do like this.

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:04.000
It is not to be done. You have to be disciplined like that."

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:06.291
Then, if you go too much with it,

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.709
then conditioning takes place in a person.

00:44:08.917 --> 00:44:14.041
And these conditionings are expressed as a balloon there,

00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:17.583
which is a by-product of conditionings.

00:44:17.917 --> 00:44:22.500
And the another one is the by-product of our activity,

00:44:22.959 --> 00:44:26.208
which is mental as well as physical.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:31.917
So we have two things, one is the manasa, is mana.

00:44:32.125 --> 00:44:35.709
I don't know, in English it is called as mind,

00:44:35.917 --> 00:44:41.166
but it is confusion, because they call a mental case to a mad man and

00:44:41.417 --> 00:44:44.959
when you work through your brain, you call it a mental activity.

00:44:45.125 --> 00:44:50.375
So I would suggest, that if the confusion has to be understood,

00:44:50.583 --> 00:44:52.709
has to be understood properly.

00:44:52.917 --> 00:44:57.875
What happens to a man who works through his brain too much,

00:44:58.125 --> 00:44:59.625
gets a heart attack.

00:44:59.834 --> 00:45:03.041
It's surprising, he should get something wrong there -

00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:05.250
but no, he gets a heart attack.

00:45:05.458 --> 00:45:09.709
A man, who works for the future through his mental capacity,

00:45:09.917 --> 00:45:12.375
gets a heart attack, means a balance.

00:45:12.583 --> 00:45:17.750
And then a man, who works with his emotions too much,

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.458
gets this brain which is degenerated, so you call it mental.

00:45:23.667 --> 00:45:27.834
So because of this the confusion is there, because of the balance.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.333
It's surprising, that in a mental hospital

00:45:30.583 --> 00:45:34.250
you don't need anything to find out about heart,

00:45:34.458 --> 00:45:36.458
electrocardiogram and all that is not needed,

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:40.208
because a mental case never gets a heart attack normally.

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.542
So because of this confusion people call a mental case

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:47.667
to a person who actually uses his emotional side.

00:45:47.875 --> 00:45:54.250
So for all our purposes we use a pure word called superego and ego.

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.750
Now apart from that we have got the Spirit

00:45:57.959 --> 00:46:01.208
and the Spirit is in the heart.

00:46:01.625 --> 00:46:05.083
It is the reflection of God Almighty.

00:46:05.667 --> 00:46:08.875
Another thing we have got down below, is the Kundalini.

00:46:09.125 --> 00:46:12.667
Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost.

00:46:12.917 --> 00:46:17.625
And Holy Ghost is the All Pervading Power of God's Love.

00:46:17.875 --> 00:46:20.583
So that's how we have these four things separated.

00:46:20.834 --> 00:46:23.417
Another thing we have got, which is the attention,

00:46:23.625 --> 00:46:25.917
which is sustained by our liver.

00:46:26.166 --> 00:46:30.834
So now you understand we have a heart, we have an ego and superego,

00:46:31.041 --> 00:46:34.333
and we have got that power which is sleeping,

00:46:34.625 --> 00:46:39.166
which is to be awakened within us, which is called as Kundalini.

00:46:39.417 --> 00:46:40.917
In the Bible also it is said that,

00:46:41.083 --> 00:46:44.542
"I will appear before you like tongues of flames".

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:48.375
And what you see is, are these centres, when they are enlightened,

00:46:48.583 --> 00:46:50.709
they look like tongues of flames of different colours,

00:46:50.917 --> 00:46:52.333
as shown you the picture.

00:46:52.542 --> 00:46:58.000
But ultimately the thousand petaled lotus here

00:46:58.208 --> 00:47:02.792
has many colours, all the seven colours of the rainbow.

00:47:03.125 --> 00:47:05.625
I hope it is clear to the subject.

00:47:06.166 --> 00:47:12.834
So far our Spirit has not come into our attention.

00:47:13.583 --> 00:47:14.792
Yes, speak.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.542
Is there any danger in Kundalini path being awakened too quickly?

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:29.166
I'm sorry I should have tackled this question everybody ask,

00:47:29.375 --> 00:47:32.333
it is true. Because so many books have been written about Kundalini,

00:47:32.542 --> 00:47:37.041
which are horrifying things and there is no danger at all.

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:40.041
Kundalini is your own Mother.

00:47:40.417 --> 00:47:43.417
She bears all the things, She bears all the problems for you.

00:47:43.625 --> 00:47:44.834
She is your own Mother.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.458
She's just waiting for the moment to give you realisation,

00:47:48.667 --> 00:47:51.542
so there is somebody who knows the job!

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:54.583
But those people who have written about Kundalini -

00:47:54.792 --> 00:47:58.625
I've seen one book which was written, I was amazed how these people,

00:47:58.917 --> 00:48:01.500
could write about Kundalini, all this nonsense

00:48:01.709 --> 00:48:04.125
in such a big book and selling it,

00:48:04.333 --> 00:48:07.917
which has no relevance at all to the state of Kundalini,

00:48:08.083 --> 00:48:11.333
to the nature of Kundalini, even to the seat of Kundalini.

00:48:11.542 --> 00:48:16.208
They are so confused, but the realm of God,

00:48:16.792 --> 00:48:19.500
everybody tries to handle, is the sad part,

00:48:19.709 --> 00:48:21.999
that everyone tries to handle that realm

00:48:22.166 --> 00:48:23.917
and they can say whatever they like.

00:48:24.083 --> 00:48:25.750
There is no danger at all,

00:48:25.959 --> 00:48:29.625
we have given realisation to thousands and thousands of people.

00:48:29.834 --> 00:48:32.000
Of course, when the Kundalini is rising,

00:48:32.208 --> 00:48:34.083
if you have any opposition within yourself

00:48:34.291 --> 00:48:36.250
due to a disease or trouble

00:48:36.458 --> 00:48:39.542
maybe little bit, you might feel hot in the hand.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:42.375
But nothing more than that, or less than that.

00:48:42.583 --> 00:48:45.999
It is a very beautiful experience, very pleasant

00:48:46.166 --> 00:48:49.750
and great pleasure to Me.

00:48:50.583 --> 00:48:51.375
Yes.

00:48:52.333 --> 00:48:58.083
Is this Kundalini energy active at birth?

00:48:58.375 --> 00:49:00.875
Is it there at birth?

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:04.166
Is the Kundalini energy present at birth?

00:49:04.375 --> 00:49:10.333
Yes! About two months or so, when you are in a foetus,

00:49:10.542 --> 00:49:14.125
it enters into your being, which is present there throughout.

00:49:20.125 --> 00:49:22.583
Is it present before birth?

00:49:22.959 --> 00:49:25.709
No, not before birth, how can it be present?

00:49:25.999 --> 00:49:28.709
You see, in the sense that in the womb it is present.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.250
It is in the womb of the mother, as the foetus it does, but

00:49:32.458 --> 00:49:34.417
before the foetus is formed, how can it be present,

00:49:34.625 --> 00:49:37.041
there has to be something to be present in.

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:40.500
So it is there when the foetus is about two months of age,

00:49:40.709 --> 00:49:47.125
it starts expressing itself there, it is there. All right?

00:49:48.875 --> 00:49:52.291
Should we do any practice for tomorrow?

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.083
For?

00:49:53.291 --> 00:49:55.333
Should we practice anything?

00:49:55.542 --> 00:49:57.000
Should we practice anything...?

00:49:57.333 --> 00:49:59.709
For tomorrow at this level.

00:49:59.917 --> 00:50:00.542
I see.

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:02.750
Should they practice anything for tomorrow?

00:50:02.959 --> 00:50:05.250
Could I make an announcement about the workshop?

00:50:05.458 --> 00:50:06.959
All right.

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:11.250
We haven't told you but tomorrow during the day we've got a workshop

00:50:11.458 --> 00:50:12.999
for those who would like can come along.

00:50:13.166 --> 00:50:15.041
May be a little inconvenient but

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.333
for those who would like to come along, there's a place for your coming.

00:50:18.542 --> 00:50:20.125
Today we'll work it out also.

00:50:20.333 --> 00:50:21.625
You can come along but

00:50:21.834 --> 00:50:23.500
we'll make an announcement at the end of the program,

00:50:23.709 --> 00:50:25.542
and the answer is yes.

00:50:25.792 --> 00:50:28.667
But Mataji will show you at the end of the lecture

00:50:28.875 --> 00:50:32.250
after you have the experience.

00:50:32.875 --> 00:50:36.667
He seems to be a great seeker.

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:41.750
Is there any other question please?

00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:03.917
Is this spontaneous awakening, as opposed to the more dangerous

00:51:04.458 --> 00:51:08.917
awakening that occurs some,  by some people,

00:51:09.083 --> 00:51:12.000
due to Your Power?

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:17.542
It's very embarrassing.

00:51:18.166 --> 00:51:20.917
It is not due to Us at all, that's all I can say,

00:51:21.083 --> 00:51:22.792
but you have got your own power.

00:51:22.999 --> 00:51:25.500
Now say for example if there is a light,

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:28.083
a candle that is enlightened, all right,

00:51:28.291 --> 00:51:30.999
and if it has to enlighten another light -

00:51:31.166 --> 00:51:35.667
is it the power of this candle that you will say that has enlightened?

00:51:36.083 --> 00:51:40.083
Because the candle itself is ready, this candle is enlightened,

00:51:40.291 --> 00:51:42.041
it just touches the other candle

00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:44.625
and that candle gets enlightened by itself,

00:51:44.834 --> 00:51:47.583
because it is just ready.

00:51:48.667 --> 00:51:51.375
I understand, from the nature I think that

00:51:51.583 --> 00:51:56.041
You have so many of the yoga teachings.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.250
What's it?

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:01.250
Periods of starving and endeavour

00:52:01.458 --> 00:52:04.750
hopefully with Kundalini (...)

00:52:04.959 --> 00:52:08.792
and sometimes, it's told, it will be in the next life.

00:52:09.125 --> 00:52:13.999
He said, from the reading and traditionally it's said that

00:52:14.208 --> 00:52:18.417
Kundalini rises slowly and it has to be the result of certain things

00:52:18.625 --> 00:52:22.583
and I think he's a little puzzled, how it can be now

00:52:22.875 --> 00:52:24.792
in Your presence.

00:52:24.999 --> 00:52:27.333
Have you read Shankaracharya, Adi Shankaracharya?

00:52:27.542 --> 00:52:29.500
He's the master of this, all right?

00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:34.417
What he says that, "Mother can do it",  that's it.

00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:37.125
You have to find out about Myself.

00:52:37.333 --> 00:52:39.166
All right? I'll better not tell you.

00:52:39.417 --> 00:52:41.500
To be tactful, one should not talk about oneself.

00:52:41.709 --> 00:52:43.083
It's a dangerous thing.

00:52:43.375 --> 00:52:45.208
Christ has said, "I'm the life, I'm the path",

00:52:45.417 --> 00:52:47.166
and people crucified Him.

00:52:47.458 --> 00:52:50.458
Just see! You dare not say anything about yourself.

00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:53.125
If you say, they will just trouble you.

00:52:53.417 --> 00:52:54.500
It's better to keep quiet.

00:52:54.709 --> 00:52:58.041
I'll do what I have to do, then you find out about Me. All right?

00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:02.125
I don't want to say anything, because if I say anything, you feel hurt.

00:53:02.542 --> 00:53:07.166
But please, please don't misunderstand me, I'm not questioning You.

00:53:07.542 --> 00:53:08.250
I cannot...

00:53:08.458 --> 00:53:10.500
I'm trying to find out the balance,

00:53:10.709 --> 00:53:13.041
thinking that spontaneous comes to me.

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:16.250
I personally am endeavoured to the Kriya Yoga.

00:53:16.583 --> 00:53:17.208
Yoga?

00:53:17.417 --> 00:53:18.083
Kriya Yoga.

00:53:18.291 --> 00:53:24.250
All right. All right. I understand you.

00:53:24.999 --> 00:53:30.583
Now, I'll tell you about. Kriya Yoga is against spontaneous.

00:53:30.834 --> 00:53:32.792
(...)  completely.

00:53:32.999 --> 00:53:35.834
And by Kriya Yoga you cannot get  realisation.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.500
There is no Kriya Yoga.

00:53:37.709 --> 00:53:40.291
In no traditional book it is there, no traditional.

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:42.709
This is a new thing started by people,

00:53:42.917 --> 00:53:45.458
they used to even cut the tongues of people,

00:53:45.667 --> 00:53:48.458
say that you put it back here, put the tracheae,

00:53:48.667 --> 00:53:51.208
do all kinds of things. There are many people in India who have

00:53:51.417 --> 00:53:56.792
their tongues waving like dogs, who have been to Kriya.

00:53:56.999 --> 00:53:59.333
There's no such things needed at all.

00:53:59.542 --> 00:54:01.208
It is spontaneous, it is within you,

00:54:01.417 --> 00:54:04.667
you don't have to do anything about it. That is what it is!

00:54:04.917 --> 00:54:06.083
Absolutely!

00:54:06.291 --> 00:54:08.667
You don't have to do anything, you don't have to stand on your head,

00:54:08.875 --> 00:54:11.250
or nothing at all. It's just simple.

00:54:11.458 --> 00:54:14.041
So Kriya Yoga is not sahaja.

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.709
'Is not sahaja' means

00:54:15.917 --> 00:54:19.291
'saha' means 'with' and 'ja' is 'born'. It's spontaneous.

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:22.583
It is a spontaneous thing, you don't have to do anything about it.

00:54:22.792 --> 00:54:25.208
Nothing.

00:54:26.083 --> 00:54:30.875
But once you get it, once you get it, you can give it to others.

00:54:31.041 --> 00:54:33.625
It's like if you know how to swim

00:54:33.834 --> 00:54:37.291
and if there's somebody who does not know and he is getting drowned.

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:38.834
What you tell that person, that

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.583
"You keep quiet just now, I'll take you to the shore".

00:54:41.792 --> 00:54:43.166
Then you are brought to the shore

00:54:43.375 --> 00:54:46.959
and you teach him how to swim, and then he can save others also.

00:54:47.125 --> 00:54:49.000
But the one who does not know how to swim,

00:54:49.208 --> 00:54:53.917
has to do nothing for the time being, just to get his realisation,

00:54:54.083 --> 00:54:57.083
mature in it and then give realisation to others.

00:54:57.291 --> 00:55:00.375
No Kriya is needed at all in Sahaja Yoga.

00:55:00.583 --> 00:55:02.291
Actually it is not at all traditional.

00:55:02.500 --> 00:55:04.709
It is a very recent stuff that has come out.

00:55:04.917 --> 00:55:07.875
If you read from the past, if you read Adi Shankaracharya,

00:55:08.041 --> 00:55:10.709
the sixth century, if you read other people, Markandeya like,

00:55:10.917 --> 00:55:13.542
fourteenth century, you'll be amazed, that

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:17.208
they have said the same thing what I am saying; this is traditional.

00:55:17.417 --> 00:55:21.291
But these new gurus came up, they started talking about this and that,

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:22.959
but it is not so.

00:55:23.166 --> 00:55:25.999
Nobody can achieve realisation by Kriya Yoga.

00:55:26.208 --> 00:55:29.250
I've not met one. On the contrary they come to Me as patients.

00:55:29.542 --> 00:55:32.417
I must say, I'm sorry to say, but it is so.

00:55:32.625 --> 00:55:34.250
People have spent so much money,

00:55:34.458 --> 00:55:38.375
from India they have gone all the way to America to do Kriya Yoga

00:55:38.625 --> 00:55:41.500
and they are just suffering. Nobody has achieved anything.

00:55:41.709 --> 00:55:43.834
So now whatever you have done, it's finished.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.750
Now you be interested in yourself and in your seeking.

00:55:46.999 --> 00:55:49.041
Just forget it whatever you have done.

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:50.625
Now what you have to do is,

00:55:50.834 --> 00:55:53.625
to just get your realisation and work it out.

00:55:53.834 --> 00:55:56.375
Forget it whatever you have been doing,

00:55:56.583 --> 00:55:58.625
because you have not yet achieved the result.

00:55:58.834 --> 00:55:59.709
So forget it!

00:55:59.917 --> 00:56:03.709
And see for yourself without any Kriya you receive it or not.

00:56:03.917 --> 00:56:05.875
It is all described but the trouble is,

00:56:06.041 --> 00:56:10.041
all the Sanskrit books which are authentic are not being translated.

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:12.625
So it's not traditional at all.

00:56:12.834 --> 00:56:16.458
Christ never said you have to do anything like that.

00:56:16.709 --> 00:56:20.125
Nobody has said it. Everybody has talked of spontaneous happening.

00:56:20.375 --> 00:56:24.625
Even Martin Luther, when he tried to change people from Catholicism,

00:56:24.834 --> 00:56:26.542
he talked of spontaneity.

00:56:26.834 --> 00:56:29.333
He was also a realised soul, but later on his followers

00:56:29.542 --> 00:56:31.333
tried to make a mess of everything.

00:56:31.625 --> 00:56:34.083
In the same way Christ also talked of the same thing.

00:56:34.291 --> 00:56:36.583
Did they say that you have to stand on your head, cut your tongues,

00:56:36.792 --> 00:56:38.417
put them back, push it back?

00:56:38.625 --> 00:56:41.208
All these things are absolutely not to be done.

00:56:41.417 --> 00:56:44.667
It's very harmful, one should never do it.

00:56:53.208 --> 00:56:55.750
So let us have now the experiment, all right?

00:56:55.999 --> 00:56:57.333
All of you are seekers.

00:56:57.542 --> 00:57:00.917
Now forget what you have been doing, what is done, forget it.

00:57:01.083 --> 00:57:02.500
Because you have been -

00:57:02.709 --> 00:57:05.834
you have to be kind to yourself, to be truthful to yourself,

00:57:06.125 --> 00:57:07.250
you have to be your Self.

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.834
I'm the only person who'll say that you have to get to it.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.500
If you don't get it, I will not rest and you should not rest.

00:57:13.709 --> 00:57:16.542
If I have patience for you, you should also have patience for you.

00:57:16.834 --> 00:57:19.709
Don't be angry with anyone, don't be angry with yourself,

00:57:19.959 --> 00:57:21.125
don't be angry with your gurus,

00:57:21.333 --> 00:57:23.750
whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

00:57:23.959 --> 00:57:28.875
You'll be amazed, I Myself get surprised the way Divine is working.

00:57:29.083 --> 00:57:32.959
Whatever you may do it, whatever may be the problems, it works,

00:57:33.125 --> 00:57:34.709
it works, really it works.

00:57:34.917 --> 00:57:36.667
It's something so amazing.

00:57:36.875 --> 00:57:38.917
It is better that you see to it, that you get it.

00:57:39.083 --> 00:57:40.917
Because you are seekers of ages.

00:57:41.083 --> 00:57:44.625
This is not a life you are wasting, you have been seeking for ages.

00:57:44.834 --> 00:57:48.667
And today the time has come, that's why you are here to get it.

00:57:48.917 --> 00:57:51.792
So please just get your realisation. Forget the past.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:56.583
May God bless you all.

00:58:12.208 --> 00:58:14.625
I would request you for a simple thing:

00:58:14.834 --> 00:58:15.917
we have to take out our shoes,

00:58:16.083 --> 00:58:18.375
because the Mother Earth also takes away our problems.

00:58:18.583 --> 00:58:20.583
She's very helpful. Even the light is helpful.

00:58:20.792 --> 00:58:23.291
Now some people ask, "Why the light?" Even this little light

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.917
is so helpful, if it is there. Just take out your shoes.

00:58:27.166 --> 00:58:31.917
Just to take help from the Mother Earth. It's very simple.

00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:36.000
Now you have to put your both the hands towards Me like this

00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:37.375
in a very simple way.

00:58:37.625 --> 00:58:39.166
First of all you should be comfortably seated.

00:58:39.375 --> 00:58:40.999
There should be no discomfort,

00:58:41.166 --> 00:58:43.750
so that when it is happening you again get distracted.

00:58:43.959 --> 00:58:47.250
Just to sit comfortably, have easy sitting,

00:58:47.458 --> 00:58:55.375
no, no tightening in the neck or in the -

00:58:56.291 --> 00:58:57.959
I mean uncomfortable tightening.

00:58:58.125 --> 00:59:00.834
It's all right, if you can feel comfortable.
