00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:50.577
Today we are celebrating the great event

00:00:50.776 --> 00:00:55.847
of the resurrection of Christ.

00:00:58.222 --> 00:01:04.643
On the same pattern is your resurrection;

00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:15.229
that you have risen to the new life of Divine love.

00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:42.284
You were all in the knowledge that
there’s something higher has to happen to you;

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:53.651
that you are to be born again, but nobody knew how it works.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:02:04.710
The subtle side of your being was never told to you.

00:02:05.924 --> 00:02:10.355
The saints only talked as to how you should behave.

00:02:10.482 --> 00:02:20.866
They only said how you should try to keep a very pure life,

00:02:21.347 --> 00:02:30.914
sincere life, but they didn't tell you how it will work out.

00:02:31.458 --> 00:02:39.826
Of course people knew in India about it,

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:46.048
very few of them, very, very few of them,

00:02:46.888 --> 00:02:55.605
but now it's a worldwide knowledge through you people.

00:02:58.927 --> 00:03:10.213
Now while your Kundalini rises,
She is your Mother, She is your individual Mother,

00:03:10.498 --> 00:03:15.671
and She gives you the second birth.

00:03:16.412 --> 00:03:30.382
That's how you get connected to the Divine paradise.

00:03:32.117 --> 00:03:37.513
All this, if it is told without realization has no meaning,

00:03:37.665 --> 00:03:44.344
but people are given great ideas about it

00:03:44.463 --> 00:03:56.916
and also were promised that one day your resurrection will come.

00:03:57.784 --> 00:04:01.374
It is the greatest happening for you,

00:04:04.105 --> 00:04:07.533
is the greatest event of your life,

00:04:08.107 --> 00:04:16.697
and one must consider it’s very fortunate
that you have been able to achieve it.

00:04:17.728 --> 00:04:25.038
All this because also because you desired for it.

00:04:25.102 --> 00:04:40.117
In many of your lives
you have been desiring for the heavenly paradise.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:52.098
People have been going round in the
hills and dales seeking; doing all kinds of things.

00:04:52.716 --> 00:04:56.726
That's already done by you.

00:04:56.916 --> 00:05:03.818
You don't have to give up anything, no need to give up anything.

00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:09.996
This wrong idea; I should say an untimely idea.

00:05:11.523 --> 00:05:20.467
This is the time when you have to get your
Sahaja resurrection, spontaneous resurrection.

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:28.500
You don't have to do anything about it,

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:35.256
it's just so simple as that; has worked out so well.

00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:44.725
I was really very much overjoyed to see that so many people,

00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:50.333
specially Muslims, about whom I have been so much worried

00:05:50.548 --> 00:05:53.949
that how can you save these people?

00:05:54.465 --> 00:06:01.734
They are so much lost in the mess of wrong thinking.

00:06:05.104 --> 00:06:13.383
One has to understand that this Koran was written

00:06:13.784 --> 00:06:18.930
forty years after the death of Mohammed Sahib.

00:06:19.843 --> 00:06:24.207
So maybe that there might be some words which are being,

00:06:24.285 --> 00:06:36.279
just being shifted maybe,
and the meaning might be little bit ambiguous.

00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:48.304
Also there was another book called Sunna came out about the same time

00:06:49.087 --> 00:06:56.050
and was managed by a person who was not such a great

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.868
soul I should say, because he was not a realized soul.

00:07:02.467 --> 00:07:10.395
I can't understand how can you religiously understand a poet same

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:17.583
and in the poetry whatever is written,
how can you interpret it correctly?

00:07:17.829 --> 00:07:24.192
This is the reason why I, I am a poet also;

00:07:24.343 --> 00:07:29.166
I could have written a poetry about it but I said no.

00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:37.376
Poetry can twist, can be twisted and also people can misuse it.

00:07:37.852 --> 00:07:40.571
That’s the problem with the poetry is.

00:07:40.922 --> 00:07:43.628
In India we had the same problem.

00:07:44.265 --> 00:07:48.540
For example, Kabira wrote such beautiful poetry

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.397
and the way they interpreted was so nonsensical

00:07:52.467 --> 00:07:59.384
and so much different from the spirit of Kabira's songs.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:05.331
About everything they can twist the words

00:08:05.413 --> 00:08:14.354
according to their own need,
I found out if I wrote poetry about Divinity.

00:08:16.009 --> 00:08:19.319
This exactly what has happened.

00:08:19.438 --> 00:08:27.145
In all the religions I’ve seen,
when it comes to poetry people can twist it.

00:08:27.724 --> 00:08:41.413
Also, like in Bible, it was so much accepted

00:08:41.592 --> 00:08:52.323
that Paul is the one who is going to organize
the publication about Christ,

00:08:54.069 --> 00:08:58.670
and he didn't want to write also about resurrection;

00:08:58.865 --> 00:09:03.245
he didn't want to write about the Immaculate Conception.

00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:07.269
All these things were in his mind

00:09:07.459 --> 00:09:13.880
and so Thomas had to run away to India
and John refused to write anything.

00:09:15.425 --> 00:09:18.629
Because all such people take charge.

00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:20.734
They become in charge.

00:09:20.917 --> 00:09:28.052
They think they are responsible for it,
while they are not at all capable.

00:09:28.177 --> 00:09:31.967
They don't have the right to do it.

00:09:33.498 --> 00:09:38.357
As a result of that, Christianity took a very

00:09:38.446 --> 00:09:44.476
wrong attitude towards the inner growth of human being.

00:09:46.555 --> 00:09:55.610
It’s, you see the result of that - today when you see what's happening

00:09:56.143 --> 00:09:59.358
with the Catholic Church, you are amazed.

00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:05.014
How can such an organization be a religious organization,

00:10:05.141 --> 00:10:09.537
where all kinds of nonsensical things are going on?

00:10:10.204 --> 00:10:16.955
I was also born in a Christian family and
I was shocked the way they interpreted

00:10:17.566 --> 00:10:22.811
Christ's life and the way talked about it with great authority.

00:10:23.859 --> 00:10:25.809
Books and books were written.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.619
They give big, big sermons.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.632
I thought there's no truth in it what they are talking;

00:10:33.008 --> 00:10:35.698
even My father felt the same way.

00:10:36.825 --> 00:10:42.809
Because all these books came much after,

00:10:43.222 --> 00:10:46.090
the authors of these books.

00:10:46.613 --> 00:10:52.878
Secondly, those who tried to write it were not authorized to do that.

00:10:53.071 --> 00:10:55.351
They were not spiritual people.

00:10:55.751 --> 00:11:02.456
They all wanted to have power; they wanted to have power in religion.

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:11.362
The power in religion is inside, and that should be awakened.

00:11:11.942 --> 00:11:18.443
I must say thanks to the Sufis of this country and other countries

00:11:18.549 --> 00:11:26.969
that people still think that there is something
beyond all these words and talks and books.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:37.230
This is something, such a blessing that we have
that in every country we had someone

00:11:37.411 --> 00:11:41.063
who talked about reality, about the truth;

00:11:41.198 --> 00:11:48.441
though they were condemned, they were tortured,
and so many of them were killed.

00:11:49.529 --> 00:12:01.835
This is happening even today; I find that
people don't want to listen to reality, to the truth.

00:12:02.605 --> 00:12:06.033
But I was so happy yesterday, really overjoyed,

00:12:06.168 --> 00:12:14.129
to see that even the people who were Muslims, were Islamic,

00:12:14.272 --> 00:12:26.576
have now coming together, understanding that
they have a higher life than these rituals of everyday.

00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:36.029
All these ritualistic life that they have led,
the way they have worked so hard,

00:12:36.793 --> 00:12:46.280
They these forty days starvation, going for Hajj -

00:12:46.542 --> 00:12:52.140
doing all kinds of things - but there was no unity among themselves.

00:12:52.274 --> 00:12:55.756
Even among themselves there was no unity,

00:12:55.817 --> 00:13:03.510
and some places I was surprised that they were killing each other.

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.562
How can that be?

00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:14.566
Because these so called practices did not make them collective.

00:13:14.747 --> 00:13:16.999
They were not collective.

00:13:17.079 --> 00:13:21.905
They were all separate identities, separate sects,

00:13:22.152 --> 00:13:29.416
guided by absolutely ignorant people.

00:13:30.619 --> 00:13:38.264
So we have to really celebrate the unity of these people,

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:44.938
the collective nature of these people, who were lost to the truth.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:51.107
They had no idea as to what truth is,

00:13:51.393 --> 00:13:59.440
but still a seeker can never find consolation

00:13:59.527 --> 00:14:02.622
with whatever exists.

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:10.191
He’s seeking; he’s seeking and seeking till he finds the truth.

00:14:10.419 --> 00:14:14.730
But also there are many seekers who lose their way.

00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:18.363
In seeking they get lost.

00:14:18.492 --> 00:14:25.053
It's very difficult to convince them that you have lost your way.

00:14:25.315 --> 00:14:29.275
But they should see from their own lives.

00:14:29.394 --> 00:14:36.532
They should see from their own attainment.

00:14:36.967 --> 00:14:40.522
What have they achieved?

00:14:41.004 --> 00:14:44.312
Have they got any experience?

00:14:45.328 --> 00:14:54.526
To be convinced of what you have got, you must try to verify it.

00:14:55.417 --> 00:15:03.100
You can verify on people; you can verify on yourself.

00:15:03.687 --> 00:15:11.219
Whatever you are, you know on your fingertips as they say.

00:15:11.692 --> 00:15:15.570
Now it’s said in the Koran,

00:15:15.825 --> 00:15:19.541
that at the time of your Kiyama – means resurrection time –

00:15:19.603 --> 00:15:24.092
they’re two things Kiyamat and Kiyama – two things –

00:15:24.346 --> 00:15:27.050
also many people don’t understand the difference.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:31.450
One is when the resurrection time comes,

00:15:31.534 --> 00:15:36.672
and the another is when your destruction comes in.

00:15:37.115 --> 00:15:43.072
For the resurrection of human being is the Kiyama,

00:15:43.223 --> 00:15:48.423
in which it’s said that your hands will speak;

00:15:48.709 --> 00:15:55.235
that you should feel the vibrations on your fingertips.

00:15:55.381 --> 00:16:08.041
I would say those who are really Muslims,
who are surrendered, and those who have been

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:22.756
selected to be higher people belonging to
the God's realm must have hands that can speak;

00:16:23.266 --> 00:16:25.806
otherwise they are not Muslims.

00:16:26.045 --> 00:16:28.219
I would not call them Muslims.

00:16:28.393 --> 00:16:32.881
They may be human beings, but not Muslims.

00:16:33.636 --> 00:16:38.327
So it's compulsory that for every Muslim,

00:16:38.431 --> 00:16:44.476
he thinks he’s a Muslim, he should have vibrations in his hands.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.215
He should feel the vibration.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:17:01.902
His hands must speak at the time of resurrection,
which is the Kiyama, Kiyama - not Kiyamat.

00:17:02.241 --> 00:17:07.251
These two words are confused in the minds of the people.

00:17:07.371 --> 00:17:16.954
So those people who can verify about
their achievements themselves

00:17:17.075 --> 00:17:20.752
through their vibrations on their hands,

00:17:20.872 --> 00:17:27.196
and also about others through their fingertips are the Muslims;

00:17:27.469 --> 00:17:33.648
according to Koran, but nobody has told them this.

00:17:34.104 --> 00:17:35.529
They don't know.

00:17:35.757 --> 00:17:38.959
To them it’s all right if you go to Mecca

00:17:39.078 --> 00:17:43.010
and come back from there; you become a Hajji, finished.

00:17:43.478 --> 00:17:48.094
There’s another question one should ask which is very important -

00:17:48.146 --> 00:17:55.428
that why Mohammed Sahib was so much against stone worshipping,

00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:00.331
clearly, why did He ask people to go round

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:04.479
that black square stone?

00:18:05.634 --> 00:18:07.914
What was the purpose of that?

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:13.948
Why was that stone so important?

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:22.505
If you ask this question to any so called Muslim
he’ll say that was the order,

00:18:22.796 --> 00:18:27.376
but you can ask the question after all why?

00:18:27.407 --> 00:18:29.613
That's also just a stone.

00:18:29.638 --> 00:18:39.220
So why did, why did Mohammed Sahib ask
that you should go round that stone?

00:18:40.509 --> 00:18:46.325
So many statues were there made of stone

00:18:46.691 --> 00:18:53.532
and people started worshipping all kinds of statues
as they do in India also.

00:18:53.939 --> 00:18:57.816
But this stone was a Swayambhu,

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:04.104
and is mentioned in the Indian scriptures
that there is Meccashwar Shiva.

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:11.260
We have Shivas everywhere in India; there are twelve Jyotirlingas.

00:19:11.457 --> 00:19:17.177
Now if I tell you, you need not believe Me,
but you can go and verify on your vibrations

00:19:17.202 --> 00:19:22.242
if it is a Shiva or not; same with this black stone.

00:19:22.535 --> 00:19:27.828
So Mohammed Sahib found out that this is a Meccashwar Shiva

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:39.393
and so the people have to go round to achieve Shiva's blessings,
but it became a ritual.

00:19:39.494 --> 00:19:48.100
The whole thing became like a ritual
and nobody could go further from that ritual.

00:19:48.617 --> 00:19:51.177
Same thing with the Christianity.

00:19:52.932 --> 00:19:58.353
Why today is a day they are talking so big
about repentance

00:19:58.518 --> 00:20:06.265
and about feeling guilty about what
they have done, but why did they do it?

00:20:06.811 --> 00:20:17.317
They are supposed to be in charge of goodness,
of virtues - so why did they do it?

00:20:17.538 --> 00:20:24.234
Why did they do wrong things and now asking forgiveness from God?

00:20:24.387 --> 00:20:28.963
Because they were not realized souls.

00:20:29.585 --> 00:20:32.005
They’re not Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:32.108 --> 00:20:37.194
If the Sahaja Yogis try to do something wrong

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:41.286
then they know that they are doing wrong on their fingertips,

00:20:41.366 --> 00:20:45.671
or we can ask them to get out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:46.093 --> 00:20:49.977
but that seems to be the worst punishment for Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:50.568 --> 00:20:54.681
If I tell them to get out of Sahaja Yoga, they don't like it.

00:20:55.351 --> 00:20:56.849
Why?

00:20:56.874 --> 00:21:05.287
Because they feel we are separated from reality.

00:21:05.597 --> 00:21:12.828
All the blessings of the reality are lost to them;
they think that way.

00:21:17.032 --> 00:21:24.372
The punishment is nothing,
because we just ask you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:30.758
To look at it’s nothing, but Sahaja Yoga is complete freedom.

00:21:31.321 --> 00:21:35.128
Sahaja Yoga is complete blessing.

00:21:35.795 --> 00:21:40.101
Sahaja Yoga is complete peace and joy.

00:21:40.958 --> 00:21:47.293
Surprisingly, if you read Koran you’ll be amazed that Mohammed Sahib

00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:53.879
wanted to bring peace, but it's not so.

00:21:55.848 --> 00:21:59.554
I met one man from Kashmir.

00:21:59.701 --> 00:22:03.239
He said that, “Where is the peace?

00:22:04.326 --> 00:22:07.695
They are all fighting, fighting; we want peace.”

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:13.025
But surprisingly, he said, “In India we find there’s peace.

00:22:13.331 --> 00:22:18.453
But this Kashmir is a mad place
where everybody is all the time challenged

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:23.392
and everything attacked - under the name of Islam itself.”

00:22:25.299 --> 00:22:27.677
So I said, it's not Islam.

00:22:27.799 --> 00:22:30.702
Islam means surrender.

00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:34.340
And he said, “If you surrender they‘ll kill you.

00:22:34.578 --> 00:22:38.425
We have no protection.”

00:22:39.085 --> 00:22:42.883
It's very surprising, very, very surprising,

00:22:43.138 --> 00:22:47.066
how now the Muslims themselves are realizing

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:52.910
that this cannot be Divine life.
This cannot be Divine life,

00:22:53.299 --> 00:23:00.910
because in Divine life people are just the same with each other.

00:23:01.118 --> 00:23:04.567
You see we had Sufis all over the world.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.676
I have read them.

00:23:06.701 --> 00:23:16.728
I have read the Sufis of Turkey and also other places.

00:23:17.108 --> 00:23:22.621
Even in India we had Sufis, though
they don't call themselves Sufis so much.

00:23:23.224 --> 00:23:31.132
Sufi means, I don't know what ever you may think it,
but according to Indian understanding

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:36.407
Sufi means 'saaf' and 'saaf' means clean, means pure.

00:23:36.467 --> 00:23:39.787
Those who are pure people are Sufis.

00:23:40.049 --> 00:23:50.436
In the purity they see nothing
but Divine grace, Divine love, Divine peace.

00:23:50.578 --> 00:23:55.361
They talked of peace only; they could not talk of war.

00:23:55.609 --> 00:24:05.409
Anybody who talks of war cannot be a person who
has got any right to do that.

00:24:07.718 --> 00:24:12.812
War is absolutely like madness.

00:24:13.055 --> 00:24:15.934
Even animals won't fight like that.

00:24:16.061 --> 00:24:22.290
We are even worse than animals when
we think of war and killing each other.

00:24:23.571 --> 00:24:29.558
This should not be done and it has to be stopped completely.

00:24:29.754 --> 00:24:39.949
Nobody has right to kill anybody unless and until he is attacked.

00:24:41.444 --> 00:24:50.699
So what we hear about our resurrection
is this - that we are above so many things.

00:24:51.005 --> 00:24:56.856
We have lost all those destructive qualities.

00:24:56.997 --> 00:25:06.572
As in Sanskrit they call it we have six enemies –
kama, kroda, mada, mathsarya, loba moha.

00:25:07.262 --> 00:25:10.392
Kama means sexual perversion.

00:25:10.595 --> 00:25:12.968
Kroda means anger.

00:25:13.576 --> 00:25:16.490
Moha means attraction.

00:25:16.736 --> 00:25:19.350
Mada means the pride.

00:25:19.699 --> 00:25:24.331
Mathsarya means jealously.

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:36.024
All these six things, sixth one is the greed,

00:25:36.339 --> 00:25:45.500
all these six things that we had in our mind - out of
our ignorance, out of our upbringing,

00:25:45.741 --> 00:25:49.936
out of our reading, whatever it is,

00:25:50.055 --> 00:25:55.880
whatever we had developed, we were having - just drops out.

00:25:57.002 --> 00:26:03.501
When the Kundalini rises and you become one with the Divine,

00:26:03.605 --> 00:26:07.541
then you are on sound grounds.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.856
You realize that you have found the truth

00:26:12.062 --> 00:26:17.763
and you no more can enjoy all these destructive habits.

00:26:18.025 --> 00:26:20.329
They just drop out.

00:26:20.727 --> 00:26:29.637
So you go into a new realm of Divine construction within you.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:34.329
This is the real resurrection of human beings.

00:26:35.266 --> 00:26:43.387
Now, you know that certain subtle things
still remain despite the fact

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:50.363
that people try to destroy the books, to spoil the meaning of things.

00:26:50.514 --> 00:26:55.154
Despite that, subtle things remain there.

00:26:55.711 --> 00:27:04.246
For example we offer eggs during Easter.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:09.132
What's the meaning of offering eggs?

00:27:09.373 --> 00:27:11.934
Why should we offer an egg?

00:27:12.262 --> 00:27:20.807
First of all we offer egg because
the egg can go into a transformation.

00:27:21.274 --> 00:27:25.132
It can become a small chick;

00:27:25.366 --> 00:27:31.208
it can be born again.
It’s the egg has the capacity to be born again.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:41.222
So when you get this egg as a symbol of Easter it means -

00:27:41.286 --> 00:27:48.737
you can become a different person, a reformed person

00:27:48.824 --> 00:27:54.519
and a great spiritual person.
You can become; it means that.

00:27:54.574 --> 00:27:56.839
Why do we give eggs?

00:27:56.892 --> 00:27:58.902
People don't know.

00:27:59.053 --> 00:28:01.073
I asked so many people.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:06.047
I asked even some priests who think
they are great authorities of Christianity.

00:28:06.294 --> 00:28:10.379
They didn't know why they give eggs.

00:28:10.989 --> 00:28:22.604
Secondly, if you read the story about
the birth of Shri Ganesh

00:28:22.768 --> 00:28:30.535
and then you proceed on, you’ll be surprised is written down
that it was called as Brahmand -

00:28:30.814 --> 00:28:38.860
means the egg of the Brahma that came into existence,

00:28:39.226 --> 00:28:47.141
and half of it became the Mahavishnu means the Christ,

00:28:47.244 --> 00:28:53.664
and half of it remained as Shri Ganesh.

00:28:54.005 --> 00:29:03.824
And then it is said that then when Mahavishnu
came out, He started crying for His Father.

00:29:04.246 --> 00:29:09.357
Just think of it, He was asking for His Father.

00:29:09.563 --> 00:29:16.306
Now if you see Christ, He always uses these two fingers.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:20.537
No other Incarnation has used these two fingers.

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:28.920
This means you know this is the Vishuddhi and this is the Nabhi.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:39.954
That means He’s talking of His Father who was Nabhi King.

00:29:39.979 --> 00:29:43.467
Who's that? You know that very well is the Vishnu,

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:49.445
and His incarnation as Shri Krishna.

00:29:49.615 --> 00:29:55.612
So what He’s indicating is this, that - they are My Father.

00:29:55.803 --> 00:29:58.022
How clearly He does that.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:04.460
Why not have some other mudras,
other style of holding the fingers?

00:30:04.578 --> 00:30:09.251
But He hold always these two fingers, meaning -

00:30:09.331 --> 00:30:15.297
My Father the one who was Vishnu and who was Shri Krishna.

00:30:16.916 --> 00:30:29.279
And then in the lives of Shri Krishna
they say, “Mahavishnu will be Your Son.”

00:30:29.483 --> 00:30:35.450
All these things are not put together as
I am telling you; separately,

00:30:35.532 --> 00:30:43.924
but if you have proper understanding
you can understand the connection between the two -

00:30:44.043 --> 00:30:55.236
that Christ was the son of Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna

00:30:55.696 --> 00:31:04.806
and that was blessed that
“You will be the support of the whole universe.”

00:31:04.961 --> 00:31:08.810
The support, the adhar of the whole universe, He said it clearly.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:19.061
It is said so that “You will be supporting the whole universe.”

00:31:19.559 --> 00:31:26.447
Now the one half is Shri Ganesh who, is the support in a way;

00:31:26.542 --> 00:31:31.712
it supports the Kundalini, it looks after the Kundalini,

00:31:31.831 --> 00:31:39.401
it looks after the chastity of the Mother -

00:31:39.632 --> 00:31:48.565
and the another one which is expressed is Jesus Christ,

00:31:49.041 --> 00:31:54.549
who is the support of the whole universe.

00:31:55.103 --> 00:32:02.084
So naturally it has to be the moral basis

00:32:02.307 --> 00:32:09.055
as He is a part and parcel of Shri Ganesha,

00:32:09.269 --> 00:32:12.751
it's the moral basis of human beings.

00:32:12.841 --> 00:32:18.811
On the moral basis only you will be supported;

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.173
not all other nonsense that they have,

00:32:22.348 --> 00:32:31.030
but a moral basis, and which is missing
in the lives of Christianity.

00:32:31.254 --> 00:32:36.982
Everything is allowed, very surprising.

00:32:37.316 --> 00:32:45.730
You can do whatever you like as long as
you don't take a divorce in the Catholic Church.

00:32:46.206 --> 00:32:55.714
And also in the other Church which you can call
non-Catholic Churches, there are many,

00:32:56.035 --> 00:33:06.916
even if you are married, you can do whatever you like.

00:33:07.274 --> 00:33:12.989
Even the Vatican I was told has all these problems.

00:33:13.736 --> 00:33:20.626
How can that be if you are the people who think you are baptized?

00:33:21.101 --> 00:33:26.011
I mean there's a big celebration of baptism by these priests.

00:33:26.317 --> 00:33:31.074
Then where is the Sahasrara and where is the Kundalini

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:34.195
and how do you have your second birth?

00:33:34.663 --> 00:33:39.548
There's no second birth, just some priest puts his hand on your head.

00:33:39.733 --> 00:33:44.525
Actually it makes a problem for realized souls,

00:33:44.708 --> 00:33:49.338
to put hand of the priest who are not realized souls,

00:33:49.711 --> 00:33:53.045
and that creates a problem for children.

00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:56.996
I have seen many children they start crying loudly

00:33:57.108 --> 00:34:01.206
when they are being blessed by these priests,

00:34:02.015 --> 00:34:05.973
because they are realized souls and the priests are not.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.500
It's very interesting.

00:34:08.587 --> 00:34:12.854
But they say, “After all you see it's the priests that are bad,

00:34:12.898 --> 00:34:17.615
but not Christ.” But how are they related to each other?

00:34:17.852 --> 00:34:22.327
Christ stood for morality.

00:34:24.096 --> 00:34:32.047
And about Him also in these modern times
they are saying all kinds of filthy things.

00:34:32.288 --> 00:34:41.932
They cannot understand a character
which is moral; to this extent we have gone.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:47.621
Morality is out of question.

00:34:48.233 --> 00:34:54.857
You do whatever you like; as long as
you go to church and confess, you’re all right.

00:34:55.619 --> 00:35:01.358
These are the absurdities of modern religions.

00:35:01.561 --> 00:35:09.836
Every religion has problems and the worst  I feel,
when you have

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.043
the support of the world as your leader -

00:35:14.163 --> 00:35:21.789
how can you allow people to have such a immoral life?

00:35:24.287 --> 00:35:33.756
Immorality how can you tolerate when you follow the example of Christ?

00:35:34.215 --> 00:35:37.762
Out of question!

00:35:38.113 --> 00:35:42.994
He is the embodiment of morality.

00:35:43.138 --> 00:35:51.183
He is Shri Ganesh and how can you allow people

00:35:51.652 --> 00:35:56.160
to come to churches, to the temples,

00:35:56.584 --> 00:36:02.084
and allow them to have immoral life?

00:36:02.505 --> 00:36:07.174
What is the atonement for such people?

00:36:08.221 --> 00:36:19.329
The basis of Christ's life, the whole being
of Christ is morality; to establish purity.

00:36:21.879 --> 00:36:28.678
Now, it was Shri Ganesha who was created first

00:36:28.868 --> 00:36:36.967
by the Adishakti, because She wanted purity around.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:45.369
She wanted human beings to enjoy their purity

00:36:45.448 --> 00:36:55.029
and their personality which was emitting light to others.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:37:01.900
If there is impurity say for example on a glass

00:37:02.166 --> 00:37:09.207
and if you use that glass on top of the light,
how can the light pass out?

00:37:09.865 --> 00:37:17.830
The impure life cannot, cannot give light to others,

00:37:17.885 --> 00:37:21.785
and cannot show your inner light also.

00:37:21.849 --> 00:37:30.165
Both things are absolutely true about impurities.

00:37:30.779 --> 00:37:35.016
But people say that we have to accept

00:37:35.128 --> 00:37:40.159
because if you have to have more people for your religion

00:37:40.233 --> 00:37:46.635
you should accept many things, and one of them is impurity.

00:37:49.233 --> 00:37:51.571
And just think of it.

00:37:51.702 --> 00:37:56.469
Now at the Agnya where Christ resides,

00:37:56.739 --> 00:38:02.580
if your eyes are impure, full of lust and greed,

00:38:03.351 --> 00:38:11.442
then you are against Christ; you are an antichrist.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:20.459
If your eyes are clean and pure,

00:38:20.783 --> 00:38:30.085
then only you can enjoy love of God, otherwise you cannot.

00:38:31.128 --> 00:38:38.550
And also the love of another Sahaja Yogi or Yogini you can only enjoy

00:38:38.633 --> 00:38:43.426
in completeness if your eyes are clean.

00:38:43.513 --> 00:38:45.929
Just imagine.

00:38:46.539 --> 00:38:56.230
But if you have roving eyes and all sorts of things, I don't know

00:38:56.588 --> 00:39:01.217
how can you call yourself Christians? You cannot.

00:39:02.172 --> 00:39:06.453
Whatever certificate you may carry, but you are not,

00:39:06.622 --> 00:39:13.991
because those who are following Christ
have to have absolutely a moral life.

00:39:14.515 --> 00:39:22.521
That's a compulsion of the inner being on you -

00:39:22.721 --> 00:39:28.558
that you enjoy your morality

00:39:29.067 --> 00:39:36.300
and you enjoy above all your clean eyes.

00:39:37.643 --> 00:39:48.276
This is what I have come to know about the Western life
that the eyes are not clean.

00:39:48.411 --> 00:39:53.315
They’ll go to the church and their eyes will be moving here and there.

00:39:53.467 --> 00:39:55.737
How can that be?

00:39:55.769 --> 00:39:58.178
How can you do that?

00:39:58.203 --> 00:40:05.184
If you think Christ is the one who was resurrected
and you are to be resurrected,

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:11.568
first of all see that you have pure love in your eyes.

00:40:11.951 --> 00:40:20.012
Now pure love is not relative, cannot be contaminated,

00:40:20.345 --> 00:40:25.551
cannot have lust and greed in them.

00:40:27.126 --> 00:40:32.727
These two things have to drop out from your mind completely.

00:40:33.307 --> 00:40:42.783
These are the days of people having greed, lots of greed they have.

00:40:45.258 --> 00:40:48.961
I just don't know what sort of things they have because

00:40:49.049 --> 00:40:53.307
I haven't studied so much the immorality of human being.

00:40:54.169 --> 00:40:58.715
Whatever I see are beautiful people like you.

00:40:59.094 --> 00:41:06.875
But when I try to understand the so-called Western culture

00:41:07.034 --> 00:41:12.634
I am surprised that even if they want to make a life for someone -

00:41:12.896 --> 00:41:18.285
like “The Life of Shakespeare” I saw,
who was according to Me

00:41:18.484 --> 00:41:26.650
was Avadhoota; means a person who has gone beyond all human

00:41:26.941 --> 00:41:34.908
destructive habits, Avadhoot is a very high quality yogi -

00:41:35.122 --> 00:41:41.653
and they show him as a stupid man running after a woman.

00:41:41.995 --> 00:41:53.815
They cannot conceive of human beings
who could be morally perfect, who will have moral sense.

00:41:53.886 --> 00:42:02.554
They cannot conceive, because those
who do this kind of thing are not realized soul.

00:42:02.783 --> 00:42:05.144
They are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:05.247 --> 00:42:10.944
So the conception about morality doesn't come into their head.

00:42:11.103 --> 00:42:14.121
They think as we are like that, the others are.

00:42:14.174 --> 00:42:18.805
Actually mostly they do it to justify themselves.

00:42:18.972 --> 00:42:30.492
So ugly and so horrifying is the depiction
of the character of such great people

00:42:30.619 --> 00:42:39.350
who talk such great things, shows that human beings
are really degraded in their value system.

00:42:39.483 --> 00:42:47.471
They cannot conceive of somebody who is an ideal personality.

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:56.410
They think by saying so they are talking of something beyond reality.

00:42:56.465 --> 00:42:59.430
They don't know reality.

00:43:00.937 --> 00:43:04.858
Yesterday’s Sufi thing, I was very impressed

00:43:04.883 --> 00:43:08.202
when they said about the four stages that you have.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:14.069
And out of that the Haakikat - means the reality,

00:43:14.371 --> 00:43:18.926
you have to get into the reality.

00:43:19.777 --> 00:43:21.979
Reality is what?

00:43:22.391 --> 00:43:25.472
It’s not a perception.

00:43:25.655 --> 00:43:31.201
It's not seeing something, but it’s being something.

00:43:33.742 --> 00:43:40.793
If you start seeing, you might see something
white, red, yellow but you are not that.

00:43:41.006 --> 00:43:50.050
When you are, you are the reality,
then you emit reality,

00:43:50.367 --> 00:43:56.235
you see reality, you enjoy reality, you live in reality.

00:43:56.410 --> 00:44:01.521
This is real life and you don't indulge into

00:44:01.585 --> 00:44:08.866
something which is unreal, imaginary or below dignity.

00:44:08.891 --> 00:44:10.437
No you don't do it.

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:15.645
You are the reality, is the Haakikat, as they say.

00:44:15.721 --> 00:44:22.178
You are the reality and you are emitting reality

00:44:22.234 --> 00:44:29.644
in your behavior, in your talks, in your lives, in everything.

00:44:32.223 --> 00:44:41.913
All this brings forth the greatest force of spirituality.

00:44:44.792 --> 00:44:53.217
Whatever is falsehood, whatever is wrong, whatever is destructive,

00:44:53.749 --> 00:44:59.993
will run away from a man who stands in reality; is automatic.

00:45:02.311 --> 00:45:07.212
It is absolutely part and parcel

00:45:07.418 --> 00:45:12.724
of the same personality who is supposed to be a realized soul.

00:45:13.269 --> 00:45:18.888
So the resurrection has taken place no doubt - all right.

00:45:19.141 --> 00:45:21.711
Your hands are speaking - all right.

00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:33.615
I don't want to give you any command or
any kind of a fixed road that you have to follow.

00:45:33.936 --> 00:45:38.186
Now you are free, because you have the light.

00:45:38.288 --> 00:45:41.271
When you have the light why should I tell you which way to go?

00:45:41.296 --> 00:45:50.286
You know yourself that you have the light,
so you follow yourself in a way

00:45:50.381 --> 00:45:55.734
that is an enlightened path, with your own light.

00:45:55.861 --> 00:45:59.891
Don’t somebody has to tell you
hat don't do this, don't do, nothing of the kind.

00:46:00.074 --> 00:46:05.340
You want just do it, if something wrong
you will not do; if you are doing it

00:46:05.374 --> 00:46:11.409
then know that you have to still rise above all this thing.

00:46:12.012 --> 00:46:18.003
You are the Nabhis that are described in the Koran.

00:46:18.243 --> 00:46:23.574
You are the ones who are going to resurrect the whole world.

00:46:23.733 --> 00:46:31.066
You are the ones who are going to help the downtrodden people

00:46:31.202 --> 00:46:36.712
into the filth of immorality. Your life should show.

00:46:36.839 --> 00:46:45.923
Look at these few of these people who were Sufis,

00:46:46.114 --> 00:46:53.342
who were very clean people, how have they been able to channelize

00:46:53.699 --> 00:46:56.900
the other people into a better life?

00:46:57.695 --> 00:47:00.110
That is what you are.

00:47:00.273 --> 00:47:05.768
You have to channelize their lives; that's your job.

00:47:05.890 --> 00:47:13.650
Don't think about what is happening,
how the people are stupid, immoral, forget it.

00:47:13.905 --> 00:47:16.715
What you have to know what you are.

00:47:16.803 --> 00:47:24.324
You have to be aware of yourself
and of your responsibility as being the purest of pure.

00:47:24.699 --> 00:47:29.350
As my name is indicates, you are My children,

00:47:29.449 --> 00:47:35.266
and that indicates the children of Nirmal, means purity.

00:47:35.501 --> 00:47:41.261
Purity is the basis of your existence.

00:47:42.117 --> 00:47:48.250
You should try to see where, what you were, in which part.

00:47:48.522 --> 00:47:54.151
There’s no mistake in appreciating the art,

00:47:54.310 --> 00:48:00.730
appreciating all that is beautiful, appreciating all

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:05.937
that is created out of beautiful minds,

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:10.838
but there should be no lust and greed in that appreciation.

00:48:11.133 --> 00:48:16.648
Pure appreciation, purity is the message,

00:48:16.702 --> 00:48:22.230
and once you have the purity within yourself you will love yourself.

00:48:22.505 --> 00:48:25.854
As I love you, you will love you also.

00:48:25.902 --> 00:48:32.756
And then you will understand this word love
which comes out of the purity.

00:48:33.043 --> 00:48:42.191
The blossoming of your purity,
the fragrance of your purity, you enjoy all the time

00:48:42.332 --> 00:48:48.334
and the love that you have flows,

00:48:48.445 --> 00:48:55.095
flows towards all those who are to be loved,
who have to be looked after.

00:48:55.412 --> 00:49:01.701
Don’t worry about the people who are destructive.

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:06.896
That's the only word I can use,
because there are so many things one can say about.

00:49:07.095 --> 00:49:12.285
Let them be destructive because they are destroying themselves.

00:49:12.386 --> 00:49:14.967
Why should we worry about them?

00:49:15.038 --> 00:49:17.480
They think they are destroying others but they are not,

00:49:17.615 --> 00:49:22.295
they are destroying themselves.
So forget about it, just forget.

00:49:22.448 --> 00:49:32.150
You think yourself to be responsible for the construction
of the whole world,

00:49:32.217 --> 00:49:34.937
it's not only a few people.

00:49:35.255 --> 00:49:39.978
You are very intelligent, knowledgeable and understanding.

00:49:40.073 --> 00:49:44.689
You are not like the Disciples of Christ who were not educated,

00:49:44.716 --> 00:49:52.611
who didn't understand so much and
who did get realization but were not of your level.

00:49:53.265 --> 00:50:01.436
Whatever they could do reached to a point
where this kind of a mess of a Christianity has come,

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.772
but you can't create that kind.

00:50:04.856 --> 00:50:14.879
You will create a new vibrant religion which is global.

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:21.392
I was very happy to see that now
we have people from all over the world.

00:50:21.638 --> 00:50:24.264
It’s a global movement all over.

00:50:24.804 --> 00:50:31.843
It has nothing to do with the limited ideas of so called religions.

00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:35.240
They have ruined every religion.

00:50:35.279 --> 00:50:43.504
Islam is ruined, Christianity ruined,
and Hinduism ruined, and Buddhism the worst.

00:50:44.017 --> 00:50:47.047
In Buddhism you give up everything -

00:50:47.222 --> 00:50:54.500
all your belongings, all your property, give to the guru, imagine!

00:50:54.929 --> 00:51:02.417
And the guru is so greedy horrible fellow.

00:51:03.256 --> 00:51:09.812
How can he give resurrection?
Himself is a greedy fellow,

00:51:10.027 --> 00:51:15.890
misleading others just taking away everything.

00:51:16.917 --> 00:51:20.478
Then same thing about Christianity

00:51:20.581 --> 00:51:23.584
that you all become Nuns,
you become Fathers, you become

00:51:23.609 --> 00:51:27.362
Brothers and I don’t know, all nonsense.

00:51:27.619 --> 00:51:31.139
But there's no change within.

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:38.549
Somebody came to Me and I said, “Why did you become a priest?”

00:51:38.638 --> 00:51:41.348
He said, “Because I was jobless.

00:51:42.705 --> 00:51:44.450
I had no job.”

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:45.450
Baba?

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:47.892
“So I took up the job of a priest.”

00:51:47.971 --> 00:51:49.431
Can you imagine?

00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:56.996
He could not fit into any job, so the minimum of minimum
he took is this job.

00:51:57.323 --> 00:51:59.553
Then what did you do?

00:51:59.727 --> 00:52:06.197
“They told me what I have to preach and first I had to practice

00:52:06.615 --> 00:52:11.107
and remember it by heart, and then I don't know,

00:52:11.231 --> 00:52:18.143
I started talking this, talking that.”
I said he must be a big possessed man.

00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:23.779
He had no mind of his own; he didn't know what he was talking.

00:52:23.914 --> 00:52:30.580
He would take out one sentence from Bible
and go on talking, boring everybody.

00:52:30.761 --> 00:52:37.992
And I was surprised that within fifteen minutes
people wanted to get out of the church.

00:52:38.358 --> 00:52:45.865
As soon as the sermon was over they would run out
and breathe, “Thank God.”

00:52:46.619 --> 00:52:50.602
Is that what religion gives you?

00:52:50.817 --> 00:52:53.470
Is that what should happen to you?

00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:56.473
No, it's not that.

00:52:56.617 --> 00:53:02.780
What happens to you that
you enjoy yourself, you enjoy the collectivity,

00:53:02.805 --> 00:53:05.079
you enjoy the goodness, the morality.

00:53:05.079 --> 00:53:11.162
The whole thing is like the nectar of life.

00:53:12.341 --> 00:53:16.900
So that changes the whole picture.

00:53:17.447 --> 00:53:24.200
The ritualism is so much; in the Hindu religion
there is too much of ritualism.

00:53:24.457 --> 00:53:31.954
You sit on the right or you sit on the left;
you do this at this time I mean, lots of it.

00:53:32.118 --> 00:53:36.952
That when your sister dies how many days you should starve yourself;

00:53:36.977 --> 00:53:40.369
if your husband dies then how many days?

00:53:41.303 --> 00:53:46.691
Dies is died, finished; the body’s finished now.

00:53:47.062 --> 00:53:51.413
So you fast for so many days - is very wrong,

00:53:51.438 --> 00:53:55.124
because you’re fasting the bhoot might come in to you.

00:53:58.130 --> 00:54:03.873
But still, what I would say all these ritualisms and all that,

00:54:04.013 --> 00:54:12.465
are created by human beings
who were claiming to be something great.

00:54:12.653 --> 00:54:19.777
They are not; by no means they are the people in charge of morality,

00:54:19.824 --> 00:54:24.767
in charge of higher life.

00:54:25.338 --> 00:54:30.881
They lead such a mundane useless life.

00:54:32.966 --> 00:54:36.160
I went to a temple of Shri Ganesha,

00:54:36.244 --> 00:54:42.284
which is supposed to be Swayambhu,
one of the eight temples; it is one of them.

00:54:45.554 --> 00:54:47.261
And I was surprised.

00:54:47.286 --> 00:54:56.509
The man who was worshipping was supposed to be the priest,
he was suffering from paralysis,

00:54:57.083 --> 00:55:04.603
and his brother died of paralysis, now his son was also paralyzed.

00:55:04.889 --> 00:55:08.017
He said, “What is this Ganesha doing to us Mother?”

00:55:08.042 --> 00:55:11.552
I said, “What are you doing to Ganesha?

00:55:11.814 --> 00:55:15.824
How much money you earn out of it?”

00:55:15.927 --> 00:55:18.536
He said, “Quite a lot.”

00:55:18.798 --> 00:55:21.053
“And then what do you do with this money?

00:55:21.078 --> 00:55:23.922
Do you do anything for the society?

00:55:23.947 --> 00:55:26.472
Do you try to improve their lives?

00:55:26.497 --> 00:55:33.034
Have you any attention on the society
or you are just ooking after yourself?”

00:55:33.189 --> 00:55:39.661
As a result, he’s got paralysis,
his brother got paralysis, son got paralysis.

00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:43.706
And he was blaming Ganesha for that.

00:55:44.206 --> 00:55:48.948
He said, “Is it a real Ganesha?”
“Yes it is, but you are not.

00:55:49.258 --> 00:55:52.334
You don't deserve.”
I told him off on his face.

00:55:52.477 --> 00:55:55.908
He said, “All right you may say whatever you like but You cure me.”

00:55:56.027 --> 00:56:01.295
I said, “First promise that whatever money you get out of this temple

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:06.139
you will spend it for the betterment of people.”

00:56:07.098 --> 00:56:10.129
But how can they?

00:56:11.573 --> 00:56:13.953
They are not realized souls.

00:56:14.056 --> 00:56:19.326
Such a lot of priests I see walking about with all this funny dresses.

00:56:19.366 --> 00:56:20.366
What?

00:56:20.557 --> 00:56:27.686
These are like dead bodies,
walking around with all kinds bad vibrations.

00:56:28.512 --> 00:56:30.707
I can't understand.

00:56:30.975 --> 00:56:36.935
And the other people are very simple,
they say, "Oh my goodness, see now he’s a priest."

00:56:37.134 --> 00:56:39.007
So they must respect.

00:56:39.032 --> 00:56:42.744
But, they don't see it; they do not ascertain

00:56:42.769 --> 00:56:50.369
what is the spiritual value of that person
who calls himself as the priest.

00:56:51.783 --> 00:56:53.913
That is your job.

00:56:54.016 --> 00:56:55.635
You don't have to fight with them.

00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:57.509
You don't have to denounce them.

00:56:57.509 --> 00:57:00.630
You don't have to describe them.

00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:04.470
No need, but understand that you are different.

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:08.345
You have the right. You are the authority

00:57:08.559 --> 00:57:11.714
and so with that authority and confidence

00:57:11.739 --> 00:57:14.809
you have to go about and save people.

00:57:14.809 --> 00:57:18.258
You are realized souls.

00:57:18.411 --> 00:57:21.112
You got your resurrection.

00:57:21.144 --> 00:57:27.174
You are yogis; I agree, but what is your job?

00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:29.851
Why, why this has happened?

00:57:29.938 --> 00:57:36.731
Why this light has come in to you is to take the blind

00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:42.671
in your hands and take them towards the light.

00:57:42.909 --> 00:57:46.786
This is what is your resurrection for.

00:57:46.961 --> 00:57:56.296
It's not only for your seeking but also is the grace of the Divine,

00:57:56.410 --> 00:58:01.478
for you to make the whole world Divine, as far as possible.

00:58:01.563 --> 00:58:04.502
How many people have you given realization?

00:58:04.582 --> 00:58:06.616
How many people you have talked to them?

00:58:06.641 --> 00:58:10.043
I tell you I was surprised; once I was traveling by plane

00:58:10.163 --> 00:58:13.687
and there was some lady traveling with Me

00:58:13.712 --> 00:58:18.635
and she started talking to Me about her cult, about her nonsense.

00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:22.292
So look at it, shamelessly she was talking.

00:58:22.569 --> 00:58:28.117
Listening to her I said, Sahaja Yogis won't,
they won't talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:28.344 --> 00:58:34.108
Every person who is a Sahaja Yogi has to talk about Sahaja Yoga,

00:58:34.298 --> 00:58:38.626
may not be with the wrong type but with the right type of people.

00:58:39.138 --> 00:58:43.520
That's a thing you have to do. That's why you are enlightened.

00:58:43.887 --> 00:58:48.673
You are not enlightened to be put somewhere in the forest

00:58:49.181 --> 00:58:52.116
or to be lost to the whole world.

00:58:52.141 --> 00:58:57.990
You are enlightened; you are resurrected to enlighten other people.

00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:01.429
That's what you are there for

00:59:01.993 --> 00:59:04.583
and you can do it. Many have done it.

00:59:04.624 --> 00:59:06.945
So many of you have done it,

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:13.594
and I would say that all of you, whether
you are a man or a woman, you have to do it.

00:59:15.277 --> 00:59:25.740
And that's the request of your Mother - t
hat make use of your realization.

00:59:26.378 --> 00:59:32.843
And the attention should be only on realization.

00:59:33.228 --> 00:59:38.381
How many people you are going to give realization to?

00:59:38.618 --> 00:59:42.505
How many people you are going to save?

00:59:43.386 --> 00:59:46.450
Is a very simple job for you.

00:59:46.507 --> 00:59:48.488
You have to just raise the Kundalini.

00:59:48.586 --> 00:59:49.636
You can.

00:59:49.779 --> 00:59:54.295
You should see how just with your hand
you can raise the Kundalini of others

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.000
and give them their resurrection.

00:59:57.402 --> 00:59:59.648
You don't have to do anything.

00:59:59.673 --> 01:00:02.917
The life is not that difficult for you.

01:00:02.956 --> 01:00:07.115
Your job is the easiest thing; it’s just to raise your hand.

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:09.591
In hand, in your hand you have the power,

01:00:09.666 --> 01:00:18.469
just to raise your hand and give them realization,
instead of feeling diffident.

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:24.384
That's why I would say you are all resurrected,

01:00:24.472 --> 01:00:27.325
you are all realized souls,

01:00:27.493 --> 01:00:31.095
and you have to create the Divine paradise on this earth.
