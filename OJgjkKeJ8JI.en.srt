1
00:00:04,808 --> 00:00:11,410
“The thought process can start
by your conditioning or by your ego”

2
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:20,806
In the West we have become very speedy,
no doubt,

3
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:29,278
and to bring down this speed we have to use

4
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:44,254
meditative process that we feel our peace
within ourselves.

5
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:54,671
Also the thoughts are bombarding our minds

6
00:00:56,373 --> 00:01:03,147
and we react very fast

7
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:11,903
to others and to these thoughts.

8
00:01:14,253 --> 00:01:18,437
So one has to be aware,

9
00:01:20,339 --> 00:01:27,441
one has to be knowing what is happening
within yourself,

10
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:35,576
that the thoughts are bombarding you,

11
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:40,718
you are trying to ascend

12
00:01:42,355 --> 00:01:50,347
and you find it very difficult to get rid
of the thoughts.

13
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,171
The thought process can start

14
00:01:59,272 --> 00:02:05,410
by your conditioning or by your ego –
only two problems.

15
00:02:12,573 --> 00:02:18,143
And you are the one who is under
the challenge.

16
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:27,746
So you have got these simple people
in the village

17
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:38,585
who start watching everything but they
do not react.

18
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:46,379
If you do not react then your thoughts
will give up.

19
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:58,335
So the first thing should be to watch
yourself that you are not reacting,

20
00:03:00,698 --> 00:03:08,108
but you are experiencing and enjoying
the silence,

21
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,608
the subtleties, the beauty, the glory

22
00:03:15,809 --> 00:03:22,345
of your being as well as whatever
is around you.

23
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:29,885
You don’t have to force yourself to break
this habit,

24
00:03:32,793 --> 00:03:37,218
but just to be on the watch-out.

25
00:03:39,858 --> 00:03:46,017
It’s not necessary to talk too much
about it also,

26
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,343
nor it is necessary

27
00:03:57,801 --> 00:04:02,329
to think about anything.

28
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:08,868
Because supposing you see a tree –
so it’s a tree only.

29
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:12,639
What are we going to think about it?

30
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,273
And whatever we may think about it,
it’s going to be the tree!

31
00:04:21,013 --> 00:04:26,684
So there’s no harm in appearing little bit
stupid – doesn’t matter.

32
00:04:26,885 --> 00:04:33,620
But this is the basic thing, is, that when
we start analyzing,

33
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:39,027
we are breaking our own nerves,

34
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:47,463
and poisoning our own mind and brain.

35
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:59,197
So to watch something without analysis,
without thinking about it, is reality.

36
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,670
If you can achieve that point where you
watch everything

37
00:05:06,871 --> 00:05:11,605
without reacting, you are in reality,

38
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:22,967
and then only the penetration

39
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:27,840
into the subtleties of your surroundings,

40
00:05:28,044 --> 00:05:32,759
of your relationships, your friendships,

41
00:05:35,622 --> 00:05:41,994
the whole universe, dawns upon you.

42
00:05:44,936 --> 00:05:48,924
So to judge others, to think of others,

43
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:55,042
what they are doing, what’s wrong
with them,

44
00:05:56,605 --> 00:06:06,650
about anything whatsoever you may think is
wrong – is not going to be corrected.

45
00:06:07,782 --> 00:06:12,824
Like I know some people who are specially
bureaucrats,

46
00:06:13,025 --> 00:06:19,431
they are travelling, supposing, by the car.

47
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:24,931
Then they will say, “I think, you see,
this road should have gone this way”,

48
00:06:25,197 --> 00:06:30,118
or “I think it would have been nice
if this house was facing the other way” –

49
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:37,582
but it’s not, you see? It is not going
to face [that way].

50
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:45,493
It is going to be the way it is, so what is
the use of wasting your brain,

51
00:06:45,693 --> 00:06:50,983
your mind, your thought, in suggesting
something

52
00:06:51,184 --> 00:06:58,646
which doesn’t work out, and never going
to work out either.

53
00:07:00,084 --> 00:07:04,193
So when we start like, “I think

54
00:07:04,944 --> 00:07:11,037
these trees should have been little
taller” – but they are not!

55
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:16,045
“I think

56
00:07:20,737 --> 00:07:28,597
that the crows should stop their noise” –
they will not.

57
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:37,485
So just accept it. Acceptance is the way

58
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,730
we are going to enjoy. But acceptance
doesn’t mean tolerance,

59
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:51,137
because tolerance means you have to work
very hard

60
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:55,292
to accept that the trees are of the same
height –

61
00:07:55,493 --> 00:07:58,518
they can’t grow – it’s too much for you.

62
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,899
When you say, “I have to tolerate it, you
see, because my mind doesn’t accept.”

63
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:17,484
So acceptance as it is whatever you see,
acceptance.

64
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:21,813
And that is how people grow I have seen,
those who start accepting.

65
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:29,424
That’s the sign. That’s the sign of their
strength and their depth.

66
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:36,710
Like the propensity of this Mother Earth,
She is what She is.

67
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,110
And She bears whatever is there.

68
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:52,856
If you put a heavy thing on Her,

69
00:08:53,057 --> 00:08:57,750
She’ll put equal and opposite force
and bear it.

70
00:08:57,951 --> 00:09:03,926
She doesn’t say, “I’m tolerating it, I am
exerting any pressure”.

71
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,461
But She is just accepting.

72
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:16,915
So the witnessing and awareness develops

73
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:22,510
when we start just accepting things
as they are.

74
00:09:23,511 --> 00:09:27,594
“I think” doesn’t work out.

75
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:36,317
“I think it would have been better like
this” doesn’t work out.

76
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:43,739
Then second problem is “I like”.

77
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:53,090
Now, “I like to eat a cake” - but there is
no cake, what to do?

78
00:09:55,445 --> 00:10:00,375
Now, whatever is there, enjoy it as a cake.

79
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:09,335
But if you go on thinking like that –
“I like whatever is not here” –

80
00:10:09,536 --> 00:10:14,157
you can never be happy, as simple as that.

81
00:10:14,358 --> 00:10:22,031
You have to say, “I like whatever is there.

82
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:29,220
I enjoy whatever is there”. Then that’s
the reality.

83
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:37,129
Whatever doesn’t exist, if you like it,

84
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,302
so what can anybody do about it?

85
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:53,516
It works out in so many ways, in so many
facets in life,

86
00:10:53,717 --> 00:11:02,221
that advantage is taken by people because
we become so vulnerable

87
00:11:02,422 --> 00:11:07,822
to our likes and dislikes that
the entrepreneurs take over

88
00:11:08,023 --> 00:11:14,663
and they create likes and dislikes in our
heads, and put ideas every day.

89
00:11:14,864 --> 00:11:17,951
I’ve seen it now, how they do it,

90
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:22,262
through television, through newspapers,
through this, that.

91
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:26,692
So then you say, “Now, I like this”.

92
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:33,382
But from where this liking has come
is the conditioning

93
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:37,167
which is put into your head.

94
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:46,380
So you are a slave of that conditioning.

95
00:11:49,692 --> 00:11:58,880
“I only like roses and I don’t like
any other flower”.

96
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:06,901
But why? Why you don’t like
any other flower?

97
00:12:11,656 --> 00:12:20,134
And for such things whatever we have
we miss the joy.

98
00:12:23,234 --> 00:12:31,312
So the second part should be that,
“Enjoy everything.”

99
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:38,143
“Why am I here?

100
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:47,549
It’s not a very comfortable place
by any chance,

101
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:51,931
so why am I here?”

102
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:59,823
To enjoy each other.

103
00:13:02,512 --> 00:13:06,152
To enjoy your own being.

104
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:14,349
The more divergence you have outside,
appealing to your ego and conditioning,

105
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:19,675
the more your mind is busy with that,

106
00:13:22,788 --> 00:13:29,957
then you cannot enjoy anything.
