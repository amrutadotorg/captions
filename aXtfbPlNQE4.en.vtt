WEBVTT

00:00.891 --> 00:08.932
Today we are here to celebrate Mahashivaratri.

00:09.053 --> 00:13.093
It’s a very great privilege for all of us

00:13.214 --> 00:16.528
to understand about

00:22.932 --> 00:25.851
Shri Mahadeva.

00:30.891 --> 00:37.174
Unless and until you have got your Self Realisation

00:37.456 --> 00:41.690
you cannot understand what

00:44.690 --> 00:52.851
is the great personality,

00:53.335 --> 01:07.133
the character and the powers of Shri Mahadeva.

01:11.891 --> 01:17.174
It is not easy to conceive,

01:17.811 --> 01:21.730
also to reach the depths

01:21.851 --> 01:27.133
of his greatness,

01:27.254 --> 01:32.053
unless and until we are humble.

01:33.214 --> 01:39.335
We have to be very humble to reach

01:39.528 --> 01:44.528
at the Lotus Feet of Shri Mahadeva.

01:52.690 --> 02:02.932
As you have seen, one has to cross even the Sahasrara

02:03.053 --> 02:11.174
to be at the Lotus Feet of this great personality.

02:17.053 --> 02:23.335
He is beyond – beyond all our conceptions.

02:23.456 --> 02:29.174
But he resides in our hearts as the Spirit,

02:29.488 --> 02:37.730
and is reflected very well when you get your Realisation.

02:39.416 --> 02:47.012
But still, one has to understand the powers of Shri Mahadeva

02:48.174 --> 02:55.416
which is not very easy to describe about

02:55.528 --> 03:04.416
this great God in liuttle words.

03:05.770 --> 03:10.456
But the first power he himself has,

03:10.569 --> 03:15.012
that he is a very forgiving God.

03:16.012 --> 03:18.609
He forgives!

03:19.416 --> 03:25.770
He forgives us so many of our sins,

03:25.891 --> 03:31.690
so many of our destructive activities,

03:31.972 --> 03:35.456
our horrible minds

03:35.609 --> 03:40.456
which tries to create problems for everyone.

03:41.214 --> 03:43.811
Up to a point!

03:46.053 --> 03:51.770
But he has the greatest power to destroy.

03:52.335 --> 03:57.690
His destruction comes so suddenly

03:57.811 --> 04:03.053
because he rules all the elements.

04:03.174 --> 04:08.730
All the elements he rules. He rules the Mother Earth,

04:09.456 --> 04:13.891
and he rules all other elements.

04:14.133 --> 04:17.609
Through their causal he rules,

04:17.730 --> 04:22.569
and he can destroy everything that he wants to

04:22.690 --> 04:27.295
if he finds there is problem.

04:33.053 --> 04:35.214
I have to tell you

04:35.335 --> 04:39.649
that earthquakes are managed by him, not by me.

04:40.214 --> 04:43.690
I am not there for destruction.

04:43.811 --> 04:49.811
He is the one who sees what’s happening on this earth,

04:49.932 --> 04:53.730
what’s happening to the human beings.

04:54.174 --> 04:58.649
I’ll give you an example of Gujurat:

04:59.730 --> 05:05.295
apart from anything, Gujurat people are very money-oriented,

05:05.416 --> 05:07.851
they are worried with the stock-exchange, this, that,

05:07.972 --> 05:11.932
all the time money, money, money, money, money.

05:12.053 --> 05:18.254
Even if they are abroad, they are extremely money-oriented.

05:20.528 --> 05:22.730
Sometimes I am surprised,

05:22.851 --> 05:28.214
impossible to talk to them about Sahaja Yoga,

05:28.335 --> 05:34.932
and they like artificial type of things like some gurus or somebody.

05:36.649 --> 05:40.375
I don’t know from where they get like this.

05:40.456 --> 05:48.851
Whatever it is, you have a state called Bhavnagar in Gujurat.

05:49.375 --> 05:51.528
Bhavnagar people came,

05:51.649 --> 05:57.972
they brought for me those silver slippers, padukas,

05:58.093 --> 06:04.295
to be vibrated; I was surprised, I was happy at least,

06:04.416 --> 06:07.416
that these people are thinking about it.

06:07.528 --> 06:13.416
So they did a Puja, they did a Havan in Bhavnagar

06:13.528 --> 06:16.649
and also in Baroda.

06:17.335 --> 06:20.133
These are the two places that were not touched,

06:20.254 --> 06:26.214
even touched even by bookambh by the earthquake.

06:26.335 --> 06:28.214
Can you imagine.

06:28.335 --> 06:37.174
And Surat which is very much distant, was absolutely shattered.

06:38.891 --> 06:42.174
There are Sahaja Yogis, very few,

06:42.295 --> 06:49.012
all of them were saved, and their houses also did not move.

06:51.528 --> 06:55.932
This is between the protection of your Mother

06:56.053 --> 07:01.093
and the wrath of God Almighty.

07:02.456 --> 07:06.295
One has to understand this very well,

07:06.416 --> 07:12.254
that he has powers over all the elements.

07:12.375 --> 07:15.528
I went to France,

07:15.649 --> 07:20.012
and there some people in France tried to trouble Me.

07:20.133 --> 07:23.528
And all the media got after Me.

07:23.649 --> 07:26.456
And on the television, everywhere,

07:26.569 --> 07:29.891
they were saying all kinds of things against me.

07:30.012 --> 07:33.488
I knew something would go somewhere

07:33.609 --> 07:38.295
and suddenly from the sea a big –

07:38.416 --> 07:43.649
I don’t know what to call it – a big storm started,

07:43.770 --> 07:46.649
suddenly, no-one knows why.

07:46.770 --> 07:51.811
And two ships were completely sunk,

07:52.609 --> 07:58.528
and those people who went to rescue them got cancer.

07:59.012 --> 08:04.811
Then it came, this storm started moving fast

08:04.932 --> 08:13.133
and all the churches lost their top – heads I should say.

08:13.254 --> 08:20.811
All the churches lost it. So many priest’s houses were ruined

08:20.932 --> 08:26.456
and it travelled and came up to the place where I had purchased

08:26.609 --> 08:29.690
a very big castle.

08:29.811 --> 08:35.416
It just stopped – and just stopped at the brink of it.

08:36.416 --> 08:39.730
Now, it is not my doing, I must tell you.

08:39.851 --> 08:43.456
But this is what he does.

08:43.569 --> 08:49.174
Though he is very forgiving, he is extremely kind,

08:49.295 --> 08:58.254
he’s blissful, but you should be aware of his powers.

08:58.375 --> 09:07.851
All those powers are used to protect my work, I should say.

09:07.972 --> 09:15.133
It goes too far and it is to show to people that

09:15.254 --> 09:20.730
they shouldn’t obstruct the work of spirituality.

09:20.851 --> 09:27.254
It should be real spirituality. It should not be somebody

09:27.375 --> 09:33.972
like a false guru coming up and showing some magic,

09:34.093 --> 09:40.488
or talking something about some far-fetched thing.

09:40.609 --> 09:44.851
But the real spirituality, if you have,

09:44.972 --> 09:48.174
the protection will be always there,

09:48.295 --> 09:51.730
and Shiva will be very blissful.

09:51.851 --> 09:55.093
It’s extremely blissful.

09:55.214 --> 10:01.133
And what does he give you is even more beautiful

10:01.254 --> 10:03.416
than you could think of.

10:05.770 --> 10:09.053
He is extremely forgiving.

10:09.174 --> 10:12.891
I should say he is the source of such forgiveness.

10:13.012 --> 10:19.690
If you have forgiveness in your heart, he resides in your heart.

10:19.811 --> 10:30.012
Otherwise, gradually, you start developing

10:31.133 --> 10:36.295
very difficult types of diseases.

10:38.488 --> 10:44.851
Say, if you are forgiving, your heart runs very fast.

10:44.972 --> 10:51.649
No-one can touch your heart. You cannot get heart-attacks.

10:52.214 --> 10:59.730
But if you are tolerating, suffering

10:59.851 --> 11:09.730
and taking many things as a power of your own,

11:09.851 --> 11:16.335
doing wrong things and forgetting about God,

11:16.456 --> 11:23.609
then you also start developing a very weak heart.

11:23.891 --> 11:27.851
So one side is that you develop a heart

11:27.972 --> 11:33.851
which is extremely aggressive,

11:35.214 --> 11:39.456
and can become like Hitler’s heart.

11:40.375 --> 11:47.609
Under any kind of pretensions, if you start torturing someone,

11:47.730 --> 11:51.335
your heart becomes solid

11:51.456 --> 11:55.851
and then you can get a tremendous massive heart-attack,

11:55.972 --> 11:59.012
and all the troubles from that.

12:00.811 --> 12:04.012
This is inevitable.

12:04.133 --> 12:09.932
But supposing you are extremely tolerant

12:10.053 --> 12:14.932
and you tolerate all nonsense, you are very docile,

12:15.053 --> 12:18.295
you are a frightened person.

12:18.416 --> 12:23.053
If you are frightened, then because of fright you do that,

12:23.174 --> 12:28.335
you can develop another kind of a heart we call as angina

12:28.456 --> 12:30.891
where the blood supply is less,

12:31.012 --> 12:36.891
and ultimately you develop a kind of guilt and

12:37.012 --> 12:41.972
you lead a very mediocre life.

12:43.770 --> 12:49.093
So this second thing also is very visible

12:49.214 --> 12:54.488
among people who think they are very, very tolerant.

12:54.609 --> 12:59.254
I am saying that tolerance is alright,

12:59.375 --> 13:01.972
because of Spirituality,

13:02.093 --> 13:05.528
but not because you are frightened,

13:05.649 --> 13:10.174
and you are afraid of something.

13:10.295 --> 13:13.649
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have no business to be

13:13.770 --> 13:16.214
afraid of anything.

13:17.375 --> 13:21.254
In India people are afraid of everything!

13:21.375 --> 13:25.528
If they can see a squirrel, they will be frightened.

13:29.528 --> 13:32.851
If they see a lizard – finished!

13:33.528 --> 13:35.730
I mean they are afraid of anything,

13:35.851 --> 13:41.851
and the ladies in India are so afraid of even cockroaches!

13:42.690 --> 13:47.053
This kind of temperament is absolutely stupid!

13:47.174 --> 13:56.093
Because that makes you a kind of a person who is prone to angina.

13:56.214 --> 13:59.093
What is there to be afraid of?

13:59.214 --> 14:02.416
If you are a Sahaja Yogi and Sahaja Yogini,

14:02.528 --> 14:06.093
you are not to be afraid of anything.

14:06.214 --> 14:09.295
They are afraid of rats,

14:09.528 --> 14:13.335
all kinds of nonsense and they boast of it,

14:13.456 --> 14:15.569
and they talk about it.

14:15.690 --> 14:21.093
Here the heart is becoming weak and weak and weak.

14:21.416 --> 14:26.609
Also, I must say, the Indian men are responsible for that.

14:26.730 --> 14:29.569
Because they treat their women as

14:29.690 --> 14:34.214
if they are appendages or some sort of a liability,

14:34.335 --> 14:36.730
I don’t know what they think they are.

14:36.851 --> 14:42.456
Their behaviour is so bad, unbelievable!

14:42.609 --> 14:48.295
Especially in north India, I have seen, women have no position.

14:48.416 --> 14:53.649
The woman is brought in the house, kept in the house,

14:54.811 --> 14:57.214
just like a maidservant,

14:57.335 --> 15:00.375
she has to cover he face all the time,

15:00.456 --> 15:06.528
she doesn’t have to go out anywhere without permission.

15:06.690 --> 15:08.609
It’s terrible!

15:08.730 --> 15:13.012
Some people say it is a Muslim influence or whatever it is.

15:13.133 --> 15:23.053
But when you believe in eternal life, in spiritual life,

15:23.174 --> 15:32.456
you should not be governed by any such nonsensical atrocities.

15:34.214 --> 15:37.093
And that’s why I feel

15:37.214 --> 15:41.649
that you really need the emancipation of women in India.

15:41.770 --> 15:47.891
They are very good, they are very tolerant, they are very sweet,

15:48.012 --> 15:56.456
but they develop all the bad diseases, all the mental diseases,

15:56.569 --> 16:01.012
because they don’t know their own value,

16:01.133 --> 16:04.416
they don’t know their own self-respect.

16:04.528 --> 16:08.851
And on this I have already spoken at length.

16:08.972 --> 16:12.254
Whey should men behave like that?

16:12.851 --> 16:20.254
I think in our country, we have at least seventy percent are women;

16:20.932 --> 16:27.335
and seventy percent people’s energy is wasted in the north India.

16:28.174 --> 16:31.569
I don’t know what they think of themselves.

16:31.690 --> 16:34.649
And then they are punished.

16:34.770 --> 16:38.891
All such countries can never prosper,

16:39.012 --> 16:42.932
because women are the Laxmis.

16:43.375 --> 16:46.488
But they have to be Laxmis also,

16:46.609 --> 16:49.569
they have to behave like Laxmis.

16:49.690 --> 16:54.649
But some of them come up like this that you are shocked.

16:54.891 --> 16:59.254
How can they be women, they look like devils?

16:59.569 --> 17:04.133
So such an imbalance in the society

17:04.254 --> 17:08.972
which is punished, again, by Shri Mahadeva.

17:10.456 --> 17:14.053
He is very kind,

17:14.174 --> 17:18.053
and he looks after the people who have to suffer it.

17:18.174 --> 17:22.851
And he tries to punish people who make them suffer.

17:23.335 --> 17:28.770
It is his quality to help

17:28.891 --> 17:34.690
by destroying people who are aggressive.

17:35.528 --> 17:38.690
He doesn’t talk of any Kundalini,

17:38.811 --> 17:41.649
he doesn’t talk of Self Realisation,

17:41.770 --> 17:45.093
he just punishes them, nicely!

17:45.214 --> 17:49.851
In such a bad way that it’s shocking!

17:49.972 --> 17:53.375
And he relieves sometimes people like

17:53.456 --> 17:59.730
– I have seen many women who live like this, suffer so much.

17:59.851 --> 18:05.214
They die much earlier than their ages.

18:05.851 --> 18:13.528
All this one has to see in the right perspective.

18:14.569 --> 18:18.972
He’s there to protect, of course,

18:19.093 --> 18:22.254
but more to destroy.

18:22.456 --> 18:28.488
He protects all kinds of animals, all birds,

18:28.609 --> 18:32.254
all the nature, he protects.

18:33.214 --> 18:40.649
He is the one who brings all the joy,

18:40.770 --> 18:44.456
all the joy of spirituality.

18:44.569 --> 18:51.891
But if you try to become aggressive,

18:53.335 --> 18:57.730
then he is the one who will destroy.

18:58.093 --> 19:04.214
Sometimes he gives more long rope to hang,

19:04.335 --> 19:06.456
and so people think we are alright,

19:06.569 --> 19:09.375
they are satisfied with themselves.

19:09.488 --> 19:12.012
On the contrary, in the west I find,

19:12.133 --> 19:15.690
the women are ruling the men more than the men.

19:15.811 --> 19:17.891
Very surprising.

19:18.012 --> 19:21.375
I don’t know how they have handled the situation,

19:21.488 --> 19:24.053
but they are ruling, all the time,

19:24.174 --> 19:27.053
and the men have to be under their thumb

19:27.174 --> 19:29.770
– I don’t know how they have managed it –

19:29.891 --> 19:34.295
but they do it! They are not humble.

19:34.416 --> 19:37.053
They don’t love,

19:37.174 --> 19:41.375
and they go on divorcing their husbands all the time.

19:41.488 --> 19:44.690
They do not love!

19:44.811 --> 19:47.295
They don’t know what is love is.

19:47.416 --> 19:54.012
But also, I have seen men don’t understand what love is in India.

19:54.133 --> 19:56.456
They don’t know how to love

19:56.569 --> 20:01.488
their wives, which is a life-partner.

20:01.609 --> 20:06.133
How to respect, they don’t understand.

20:06.254 --> 20:11.254
There, then comes a great wrath,

20:11.375 --> 20:15.891
and this wrath works in so many ways,

20:16.609 --> 20:19.730
in creating horrible diseases

20:19.851 --> 20:27.295
and in creating problems and problems for such men.

20:32.932 --> 20:37.770
And the society also is responsible

20:37.891 --> 20:45.174
for doing all kinds of things against humble people.

20:47.093 --> 20:53.730
Both ways, one has to understand, that if you are aggressive,

20:53.851 --> 21:00.690
you are under the Third Eye of Shri Mahadeva.

21:01.569 --> 21:07.012
In any way if you are aggressive, say with your servants,

21:07.133 --> 21:10.972
if you are aggressive with your subordinates,

21:11.093 --> 21:16.690
if you are aggressive with your children,

21:17.770 --> 21:23.174
there is this wrathful God watching,

21:23.254 --> 21:30.649
and one can get under the spell of his destruction.

21:32.254 --> 21:38.932
But he gives us the great heights of Himalaya.

21:39.456 --> 21:49.254
He makes human beings extremely beautiful, very noble,

21:49.851 --> 21:55.649
and he wants that people should love each other.

21:56.295 --> 22:00.416
There should be pure love among human beings.

22:01.254 --> 22:12.891
And also he makes you, very delicately,

22:15.528 --> 22:18.690
behaving towards other people;

22:18.811 --> 22:23.730
very sweetly behaving towards others.

22:24.295 --> 22:32.416
If you don’t have that, then you are going in the wrong direction.

22:32.528 --> 22:35.214
But his greatest privilege,

22:35.335 --> 22:40.133
that he gives you the height and the depth.

22:40.811 --> 22:49.012
If you are worshipping him, then you develop such heights

22:49.133 --> 22:54.295
that you see the whole world as a witness.

22:54.690 --> 23:02.770
He sees the whole world as a sakshi-swarupa, as a witness.

23:02.891 --> 23:09.174
And so he is the knowledge, he is the pure knowledge.

23:09.295 --> 23:13.012
You may get your Realisation, alright;

23:13.932 --> 23:17.214
you might feel the cool breeze in your hands, alright;

23:17.335 --> 23:22.335
but do you have the knowledge?

23:22.456 --> 23:27.012
I have to tell you what finger means what,

23:27.133 --> 23:32.053
what hand means what, what is vibrations, I have to tell you.

23:32.174 --> 23:37.851
He is that knowledge, He is the pure knowledge,

23:37.972 --> 23:43.770
complete knowledge, of the highest level.

23:43.972 --> 23:48.528
So he is the source of knowledge.

23:48.770 --> 23:56.456
Those people who are not humble cannot get that knowledge.

23:57.012 --> 24:01.690
Those people who are arrogant

24:01.811 --> 24:08.730
and who do not handle others delicately, sweetly, beautifully,

24:09.851 --> 24:13.335
are not blessed by him.

24:13.456 --> 24:20.770
They cannot achieve anything in life.

24:20.891 --> 24:23.133
What do we have to achieve?

24:23.254 --> 24:30.295
Not your position, not your wealth, not all these outward things,

24:30.416 --> 24:34.891
but you have to achieve a loving heart!

24:35.012 --> 24:38.488
Heart with which you can love.

24:38.609 --> 24:42.811
If there is Shiva in your heart, you will love

24:42.932 --> 24:48.528
everyone in a very beautiful manner.

24:48.649 --> 24:53.609
There won’t be any nonsensical ideas about love.

24:53.730 --> 25:05.456
Just pure love, pure love for all the people.

25:05.851 --> 25:14.488
With the blessing, then all your harshness goes away.

25:14.891 --> 25:19.770
For example, if you have a little power, little power,

25:22.932 --> 25:26.488
so you start to misuse it.

25:27.174 --> 25:35.093
Look at Shiva, he has so many powers; if he starts misusing,

25:35.214 --> 25:39.770
there won’t be even a blade of grass left on this earth.

25:39.891 --> 25:46.730
How much you are sinful, selfish, you know that.

25:48.093 --> 25:50.456
But still he gives you a chance

25:50.609 --> 25:53.335
‘So let’s see, they might improve’.

25:53.456 --> 25:58.488
And he is extremely generous, extremely generous,

25:58.609 --> 26:04.770
he is very forgiving and also extremely generous.

26:05.295 --> 26:14.569
Now supposing there are people who are living in a desert

26:15.295 --> 26:19.254
and they are very good people,

26:19.375 --> 26:24.214
and they are suffering because they are living in a desert,

26:24.335 --> 26:29.690
he will create oasis for them, he controls the Mother Earth.

26:29.811 --> 26:33.770
He can do everything to make them happy,

26:33.891 --> 26:39.770
if they are spiritual, if they worship.

26:40.093 --> 26:44.053
But human beings are so stupid

26:44.174 --> 26:49.528
that they go on fighting also in the name of God.

26:49.649 --> 26:56.891
Like in the south we have two types of people,

26:57.012 --> 27:00.569
one who worships Shiva, another who worships Vishnu.

27:00.690 --> 27:02.254
Can you imagine!

27:03.053 --> 27:06.254
Vishnu used to worship Shiva!

27:06.375 --> 27:11.093
Nobody’s higher, nobody’s lower. It’s so important.

27:11.214 --> 27:13.770
Everything is so important.

27:13.891 --> 27:19.133
But they used to fight on this point, if they are worshipping Shiva,

27:19.254 --> 27:22.214
or they are worshipping Vishnu,

27:22.335 --> 27:25.528
and nowhere near the reality they were.

27:25.649 --> 27:28.770
They didn’t know what was the reality, nothing,

27:28.891 --> 27:32.254
just fighting, fighting, fighting.

27:32.375 --> 27:38.456
In the name of God, those who fight, Shiva comes on them

27:38.609 --> 27:41.932
and with his trident hits them.

27:42.053 --> 27:44.730
You are not to fight in the name of God,

27:44.851 --> 27:47.972
but you have to love and understand.

27:48.093 --> 27:51.932
So this fighting in the name of God is a nonsense.

27:52.053 --> 27:55.375
Not only that but it’s very, very dangerous.

27:55.488 --> 28:00.214
All such people who do that will be destroyed.

28:00.335 --> 28:06.456
It is self-destructive. Such people will be destroyed completely.

28:06.609 --> 28:13.690
So, you should understand that in the name of God you have to love.

28:13.811 --> 28:15.972
You have to understand.

28:16.093 --> 28:19.214
You need not tolerate nonsenses, it’s different;

28:19.335 --> 28:25.456
but you have to love people, spread you love.

28:25.569 --> 28:30.932
Gradually this love can go all over, all over the world,

28:31.053 --> 28:37.133
and then the vision of mine I can see working out.

28:37.254 --> 28:41.053
But if there is fighting, there’s hatred,

28:41.174 --> 28:43.690
there’s all kinds of aggressiveness,

28:43.811 --> 28:48.416
these are all against Shiva, and such people will be destroyed.

28:48.528 --> 28:50.932
What will I do with them?

28:51.053 --> 28:54.295
What can I do if they are destroyed?

28:54.416 --> 29:00.133
If they are very money oriented, materialistic people,

29:00.254 --> 29:04.214
they are not loving them, they are loving only for money.

29:04.335 --> 29:08.335
All such people will be destroyed, no doubt.

29:08.456 --> 29:15.375
One should be not only humble, but should be extremely loving.

29:15.488 --> 29:22.375
To get the blessings of Shiva you have to be extremely loving.

29:23.690 --> 29:30.133
Such people may not be very cunning, clever,

29:30.254 --> 29:34.456
maybe very innocent – they must be.

29:34.569 --> 29:39.730
Because when you love somebody, you want to help that person.

29:39.851 --> 29:41.811
I have suffered myself,

29:41.932 --> 29:46.375
I have tried to help people and they have deceived me.

29:46.569 --> 29:49.335
So what? That’s their nature,

29:49.456 --> 29:52.012
and they are destroyed, what can I do?

29:52.133 --> 29:57.133
I didn’t ask them that you deceive me, but they deceived me

29:57.254 --> 29:59.375
– I don’t know why.

29:59.456 --> 30:03.730
And I have been very kind and nice, and still they deceived me.

30:03.851 --> 30:10.375
So when the destruction follows, what can I do about it?

30:10.528 --> 30:13.569
I don’t want anybody to be destroyed,

30:13.690 --> 30:16.375
I love this creation of mine,

30:16.488 --> 30:18.254
and I don’t have

30:18.375 --> 30:24.730
any way of protecting them if they are destructive.

30:25.649 --> 30:32.053
Because there is another great power who can destroy them.

30:33.254 --> 30:39.093
See then, I am absolutely in a helpless condition, sometimes I feel

30:39.214 --> 30:41.770
and I don’t know how to express,

30:41.891 --> 30:45.254
but one has to understand as Sahaja Yogis

30:45.375 --> 30:52.012
that with Shiva’s love and his blessings

30:52.133 --> 31:01.174
you can become extremely loving, extremely generous,

31:01.295 --> 31:09.528
very, very sweet and innocent like children.

31:10.254 --> 31:13.488
You have to be innocent.

31:13.609 --> 31:17.375
There is no need to be very clever and cunning

31:17.488 --> 31:26.174
and you will be amazed how your innocence will be protected.

31:26.295 --> 31:31.012
If you are innocent, you don’t have to worry,

31:31.456 --> 31:40.891
there’s a power, the Third Eye of Shiva looking after you.

31:41.012 --> 31:44.335
Wherever you are going, he is with you.

31:44.456 --> 31:47.891
That doesn’t mean that you become stupid.

31:48.012 --> 31:54.053
It doesn’t mean that you are not practical.

31:54.174 --> 31:58.972
All that is taken over, all the practical side,

31:59.093 --> 32:01.730
by the power of Shiva.

32:01.851 --> 32:08.569
His guidance, his love, his kindness,

32:08.690 --> 32:12.851
you can see at every, every step of life.

32:12.972 --> 32:15.770
But first of all, watch your steps!

32:15.891 --> 32:20.456
Are you aggressive? Are you troublesome?

32:20.569 --> 32:25.811
Do you say harsh things to others?

32:26.609 --> 32:30.972
Or are you humble? Are you gentle?

32:31.093 --> 32:36.569
And if you are kind, he is very much pleased.

32:36.690 --> 32:43.053
In the nature, it is His rule that works.

32:43.690 --> 32:46.569
And they (animals) are so systematic,

32:46.690 --> 32:54.609
they live with understanding of each other.

32:54.730 --> 33:11.053
For example, if you go in the jungle and it is absolutely quiet,

33:11.811 --> 33:15.012
and you don’t even hear the birds twittering:

33:15.133 --> 33:19.254
then you should know there is a tiger sitting some way.

33:19.375 --> 33:23.932
Because he is the king. They know they have to obey,

33:24.053 --> 33:28.093
and when the king is there, his protocol is there.

33:28.214 --> 33:31.254
They know automatically what is the protocol of the king.

33:31.375 --> 33:35.972
Nobody would be even moving if he is there.

33:36.093 --> 33:38.851
He sits in his majesty.

33:38.972 --> 33:44.335
Then in one week, or maybe fifteen days he will kill one animal.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.254
He has to eat.

33:46.375 --> 33:55.214
He kills one animal then he and his family, they eat first.

33:55.295 --> 33:59.891
He waits for some time, of course, for the blood to ooze out,

34:00.012 --> 34:03.569
then the whole family comes and eats.

34:03.690 --> 34:06.972
Then he leaves the body there.

34:07.093 --> 34:13.730
Then by gradation, one by one, all kinds of animals come

34:13.851 --> 34:16.932
and eat it as a prasad.

34:17.053 --> 34:25.972
And the last thing are the crows who come and eat that animal.

34:26.093 --> 34:31.375
Such discipline, such understanding of the protocol;

34:31.488 --> 34:38.488
I am amazed how animals are managed by Shiva.

34:38.609 --> 34:45.254
You never hear that animals are having a ‘strike’,

34:45.375 --> 34:52.528
or animals are having a big ‘underworld’ animals!

34:52.649 --> 34:59.811
You don’t hear that these animals are stealing things.

34:59.932 --> 35:05.649
And just imagine, we are coming from that animal life,

35:05.770 --> 35:08.609
but we are worse than them.

35:08.730 --> 35:13.932
How are we going to rise if we have all such funny ideas

35:14.053 --> 35:19.528
of behaving in such a manner of fighting.

35:19.649 --> 35:23.456
On any small little excuse they will fight,

35:23.609 --> 35:25.851
they will start fighting.

35:25.972 --> 35:29.214
Animals also fight a little bit among themselves,

35:29.335 --> 35:32.012
but not in a collective way.

35:32.133 --> 35:36.012
They don’t do it in a collective way as we do it here.

35:38.569 --> 35:43.214
It is really at the slightest provocation

35:43.335 --> 35:47.295
we get into groups and start fighting.

35:47.416 --> 35:51.416
They get into groups but they don’t fight.

35:51.528 --> 35:53.569
What is the thing among them?

35:53.690 --> 36:00.174
Everything is so much, so much understood by animals,

36:00.295 --> 36:07.295
why not for us also to understand the law of nature?

36:07.416 --> 36:09.456
It is Mahadeva

36:09.569 --> 36:17.053
who manages that all the nature’s law are to be obeyed.

36:17.174 --> 36:21.609
Even the Mother Earth, the sky, everything,

36:21.730 --> 36:25.335
is looked after by him.

36:25.456 --> 36:29.012
He does nice, nice, beautiful things for us.

36:29.133 --> 36:31.932
With the changing of the seasons,

36:32.053 --> 36:36.690
he creates these beautiful flowers;

36:36.811 --> 36:41.972
he creates all that is soothing and joy-giving and beautiful,

36:42.093 --> 36:43.851
he looks after.

36:43.972 --> 36:49.174
He gives us to see what nature has given us,

36:49.295 --> 36:56.254
and tries to please us, keep us happy, entertain,

36:56.375 --> 36:59.053
like an innocent child.

36:59.174 --> 37:02.811
But while we are, in our arrogance,

37:02.932 --> 37:07.012
we have our reactions – to everything!

37:07.295 --> 37:11.133
You see a carpet, you will say “I don’t like it!”

37:11.254 --> 37:14.012
Especially in the west, it is a common

37:14.133 --> 37:15.932
thing to say “I don’t like it”.

37:16.053 --> 37:20.891
Who are you not to like something, or to dislike something?

37:21.012 --> 37:23.456
What do you think of yourself?

37:23.569 --> 37:26.972
It’s very common, and shamelessly they will say

37:27.093 --> 37:33.174
“I don’t like this, I like it …” It’s impossible!

37:33.254 --> 37:36.690
Such human beings, I don’t know where they will go,

37:36.811 --> 37:38.690
what will happen to them.

37:38.811 --> 37:44.811
Instead of appreciating, instead of enjoying everything,

37:44.932 --> 37:49.972
why to start criticizing and reacting.

37:50.093 --> 37:52.811
Reaction is much more in the west, I must say,

37:52.932 --> 37:54.770
not so much in India.

37:54.891 --> 38:01.093
But there are certain cultural differences, I think,

38:01.214 --> 38:03.416
that’s why people say like that.

38:03.569 --> 38:05.528
Here if somebody says like that,

38:05.649 --> 38:08.012
people will think that person is mad or that

38:08.133 --> 38:11.012
something is wrong with him, the way he talks.

38:11.133 --> 38:16.528
It is important how you express your love,

38:16.649 --> 38:20.488
how you talk about your love.

38:20.609 --> 38:23.972
Start it with your wife, to begin with,

38:24.093 --> 38:28.811
and then you can move towards your children and other people.

38:28.891 --> 38:31.053
And we are so stupid sometimes,

38:31.174 --> 38:35.214
that we love the whole world but we can’t love our wives!

38:35.335 --> 38:39.254
It’s a specialty! In India that’s very true,

38:39.375 --> 38:43.053
but also in the west I have seen people love their wives

38:43.174 --> 38:48.133
because of fear – fear of divorce maybe, I don’t know –.

38:49.012 --> 38:58.214
Love should have no fear. It should be just ‘free’ love.

38:58.456 --> 39:07.609
Without any fear, without any aggression, enjoy that pure love.

39:07.730 --> 39:14.214
And that is what is missing in the human beings today as it is.

39:14.335 --> 39:19.174
When the day will come when human beings will

39:19.254 --> 39:24.851
be understanding the beauty of love,

39:24.972 --> 39:33.891
then from the heavens there will be flowers falling on us,

39:34.012 --> 39:40.416
it would be such a tremendous day when

39:44.569 --> 39:50.416
Mahadeva will be able to close his Third Eye

39:50.528 --> 39:53.770
and would be peaceful in his heart.

39:53.891 --> 39:57.093
It is my vision.

39:57.214 --> 40:01.214
It’s the future for you;

40:01.335 --> 40:07.932
to see how peacefully you can talk to people,

40:08.053 --> 40:14.133
how sweetly you can love others,

40:14.811 --> 40:18.416
how much you can give to others.

40:18.569 --> 40:24.649
For example, they have to give something,

40:24.891 --> 40:28.770
they’ll go in the market and buy the cheapest,

40:28.891 --> 40:33.093
the rottenest thing for giving.

40:34.214 --> 40:36.528
That’s not the way.

40:36.649 --> 40:43.053
You must buy small or big, whatever it is, out of love!

40:43.174 --> 40:46.053
That (thing) should talk about your love,

40:46.174 --> 40:48.488
tell about your love,

40:48.609 --> 40:52.569
and not about your money and what you have spent.

40:52.690 --> 40:56.730
It’s very common nowadays, even in India,

40:56.851 --> 41:03.174
that people try to show how much they are worth,

41:03.295 --> 41:07.214
what they wear, how they dress up.

41:07.335 --> 41:16.456
For what? For what? I’ve known such people, very many,

41:16.609 --> 41:19.932
and when they die there are not even four people available

41:20.053 --> 41:23.053
to carry their dead bodies!

41:23.174 --> 41:26.811
When they lived they think no end of themselves.

41:26.972 --> 41:33.528
That time, you should see how many people there are

41:34.214 --> 41:39.133
to love that person, to care for that person.

41:39.254 --> 41:44.416
Maybe it is the upbringing,

41:44.569 --> 41:47.295
maybe, that he had never known love,

41:47.416 --> 41:49.416
anything you may blame.

41:49.528 --> 41:53.851
But for a Sahaja Yogi it is important to learn

41:53.972 --> 42:02.012
that love is your life, love is spirituality, and love

42:02.133 --> 42:07.174
– without expectations – to do something.

42:07.295 --> 42:11.053
Some people are, I know, very good at helping

42:11.174 --> 42:13.649
poor people, this, that.

42:13.770 --> 42:19.730
But behind that is the power that …

42:21.649 --> 42:25.214
They think “Oh, we are great, we are doing this work, that work”

42:25.335 --> 42:29.770
just to satisfy their power, not their love.

42:29.891 --> 42:33.174
So when you are working,

42:33.295 --> 42:38.569
you have to know that it’s just to satisfy your Spirit,

42:38.690 --> 42:42.649
just to satisfy your love that you are doing it,

42:42.770 --> 42:50.295
not for any name or for any kind of a position.

42:50.416 --> 42:58.851
If you have that kind of a detached love,

42:58.972 --> 43:05.488
virakta as they call it, then nobody has to certify you.

43:05.609 --> 43:11.649
You have it, and you are enjoying it!

43:14.335 --> 43:19.770
It is unfortunate I have to speak in English language,

43:19.891 --> 43:24.093
and maybe there are some who do not understand English,

43:24.214 --> 43:29.214
but nowadays English has become dominating, what to do?

43:29.335 --> 43:32.851
You have to suppose people will read  English language.

43:32.972 --> 43:36.730
I can’t use any other language.

43:37.133 --> 43:43.416
But one has to speak the language of love.

43:43.528 --> 43:49.214
You see animals, you see if you have a horse

43:49.335 --> 43:51.133
and if you have a dog,

43:51.254 --> 43:57.972
all these animals, they understand your love;

43:58.456 --> 44:04.811
how they stick to you, how they express their love,

44:04.932 --> 44:07.456
they are very sweet.

44:08.609 --> 44:13.569
And this we have to learn from them now, I think.

44:13.690 --> 44:18.295
Otherwise I don’t know how to make them understand

44:18.375 --> 44:21.133
the value of love.

44:22.254 --> 44:30.456
It is not that the way people are criticising:

44:30.569 --> 44:36.012
that we are not practical, that we have not

44:36.133 --> 44:44.770
achieved much money or power or something, that’s not important.

44:45.295 --> 44:50.569
Because there are many like that selling in the market.

44:51.012 --> 44:59.254
But we are different. We are the jewels of humanity,

44:59.375 --> 45:02.528
and we have to be like that, shining,

45:02.649 --> 45:07.730
cutting out all the wrong things within us

45:07.851 --> 45:15.093
as a diamond is cut to look something very, very great.

45:15.932 --> 45:23.649
My only, if I have any desire, is that:

45:23.770 --> 45:31.609
‘Try to follow the qualities of Shri Mahadeva’.

45:32.254 --> 45:42.416
How great he is, how detached he is, detached, absolutely detached.

45:42.528 --> 45:49.730
He lives with bones and things like that.

45:50.375 --> 45:54.214
He is not bothered about where he is, what he lives with,

45:54.335 --> 45:57.488
what he has, nothing.

45:57.972 --> 46:02.811
So detached, and we should be detached like that.

46:02.932 --> 46:08.012
At the same time, we should be very loving like him,

46:08.133 --> 46:11.488
extremely loving.

46:11.609 --> 46:16.174
How his heart is full of love for others,

46:16.295 --> 46:19.174
how he looks after others.

46:19.295 --> 46:25.851
I am warning you, because I know you all love me very much,

46:25.972 --> 46:29.254
but you should also love each other,

46:29.375 --> 46:32.375
you should have a loving heart,

46:32.488 --> 46:37.851
and have satisfaction in loving others.

46:37.972 --> 46:42.932
If you could develop that, your height will grow,

46:43.053 --> 46:48.012
your depth in Sahaja Yoga will grow.

46:48.133 --> 46:53.456
It’s alright, the Goddess gives you the shraddha, alright,

46:53.609 --> 46:57.770
but the depth in shraddha,

46:58.972 --> 47:03.609
in Sanskrit, or in Hindi and Marathi I don’t know,

47:03.730 --> 47:07.932
but in Marathi they call it dyas.

47:08.053 --> 47:14.569
Just deep in to that love, drenched in to that love,

47:14.690 --> 47:17.811
enjoying that love – then you don’t want anything.

47:17.932 --> 47:22.528
What do you want? You’ve got everything.

47:22.649 --> 47:25.133
So what do you want now?

47:25.254 --> 47:33.770
Just like the greatness of Shri Mahadeva.

47:33.891 --> 47:39.609
He’s so great that he’s detached.

47:39.730 --> 47:43.528
What does he want? I mean nothing is greater than him,

47:43.649 --> 47:47.932
nothing is more important than him. Then what does he want?

47:48.053 --> 47:53.770
He doesn’t want anything. That’s why he’s detached.

47:53.891 --> 47:59.375
This detachment you have to develop.

47:59.456 --> 48:05.609
But at the same time he is the Lord of all the arts,

48:05.730 --> 48:10.012
of the music, of the rhythm.

48:10.133 --> 48:14.528
The other day you saw these boys were playing the rhythm.

48:14.649 --> 48:18.254
The whole rhythm of everything he gives.

48:18.375 --> 48:26.851
The rhythmic life that we have, we are not yet aware of it.

48:26.972 --> 48:36.609
See a child is born exactly after nine months and so-many days.

48:36.730 --> 48:39.770
Who keeps this rhythm?

48:40.690 --> 48:45.690
Then we get, say, certain flowers at such-and-such time,

48:45.811 --> 48:52.174
then we get in the nature all kinds of seasons.

48:52.295 --> 48:54.569
Who keeps the rhythm?

48:54.690 --> 48:59.649
He is the one who is nothing but rhythm!

48:59.770 --> 49:04.416
And that rhythm is kept up, in the nature,

49:04.528 --> 49:07.770
in everything there is a rhythm.

49:07.891 --> 49:14.851
And a rhythmic person is the one who has a very large heart!

49:15.569 --> 49:18.609
It’s like an ocean.

49:18.730 --> 49:23.932
You get just that rhythm disturbed immediately if you

49:24.053 --> 49:29.416
find somebody who is being very cruel, very bad and all that.

49:29.528 --> 49:38.053
But in a smooth, beautiful, peaceful lake,

49:38.174 --> 49:42.811
there is no ripple at all, it is just love.

49:42.891 --> 49:46.093
And then at that time, if the rhythm,

49:46.214 --> 49:51.335
the silent rhythm of that heart is broken,

49:51.456 --> 49:54.569
then Shiva takes charge.

49:54.690 --> 50:02.053
So one has to have a complete sense of the rhythm of time,

50:02.174 --> 50:07.416
rhythm of nature, rhythm of everything.

50:07.569 --> 50:10.891
People don’t know even the names of the flowers.

50:11.012 --> 50:14.093
They don’t know what these flowers are,

50:14.214 --> 50:17.053
what time they come up;

50:17.174 --> 50:23.972
they have no idea what is the rhythm of their ‘living’

50:24.093 --> 50:26.053
– nobody’s bothered.

50:26.174 --> 50:31.295
All over, if you see, there is seasons and things.

50:31.416 --> 50:37.811
So all the rhythm, like his play, with tabla or pakwaj

50:37.932 --> 50:45.811
on which he played all the beautiful tunes of all the seasons.

50:45.932 --> 50:49.730
And that’s how the nature flourishes

50:49.851 --> 50:54.609
and comes up and then subsides.

50:54.730 --> 50:57.690
We do not see that point.

50:57.770 --> 51:01.770
We are just bothered about ourselves.

51:01.891 --> 51:04.214
Like I’ll ask “How are you?”

51:04.335 --> 51:07.891
“Mother, I’ve got a headache, I’ve got a stomach trouble,

51:08.012 --> 51:12.528
I have another trouble” … or everything is there.

51:12.649 --> 51:18.012
But another one would say “Ah, I’m alright!”

51:18.133 --> 51:19.770
“So, what’s the matter?”

51:19.891 --> 51:22.093
“Put the world right Mamma!

51:22.214 --> 51:24.609
Mother, why don’t you put the world right?”

51:24.730 --> 51:30.488
He’s worried about others, not about himself.

51:30.609 --> 51:36.609
And in that understanding of what one should do

51:36.730 --> 51:40.335
to make this world happy, beautiful,

51:40.456 --> 51:45.214
for that one has to really work hard, so called,

51:45.335 --> 51:49.375
and in that working one thinks,

51:49.528 --> 51:55.569
“Isn’t it our duty to make this world beautiful?

51:55.690 --> 51:59.053
Isn’t it our job to make

51:59.174 --> 52:04.295
this world rhythmic, rhyming with the Spirit?”

52:04.416 --> 52:07.456
It’s our duty. We have to do it!

52:07.569 --> 52:14.053
Not only taking Sahaja Yoga for yourself, but for others.

52:14.174 --> 52:17.649
It’s not you are all the time worried about yourself,

52:17.770 --> 52:21.375
but you are worried about others,

52:21.528 --> 52:25.375
what’s happening in the world.

52:25.456 --> 52:31.416
That is love! That love is spontaneous,

52:31.528 --> 52:35.932
and when it works, it works wonders.

52:41.012 --> 52:45.932
So this is a beautiful evening,

52:46.730 --> 52:58.295
where we are worshipping such a great source of our ascent.

52:58.416 --> 53:03.811
And I hope you people will understand

53:03.932 --> 53:08.488
how far you are with that force,

53:08.609 --> 53:13.690
how much are you drenched in that force,

53:13.811 --> 53:20.335
in that rhythm of Shiva,

53:20.456 --> 53:25.811
who, in his rhythmic way, gives you vibrations.

53:25.932 --> 53:30.609
Vibrations flow in the way we live,

53:30.730 --> 53:36.488
and that way should engulf you completely;

53:36.609 --> 53:41.254
and you should be asked in that your ‘I-ness’

53:41.375 --> 53:43.843
should be dissolved in that which is I bless you.

53:43.868 --> 53:45.384
Thank you.
