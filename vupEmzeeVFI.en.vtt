WEBVTT

00:00.538 --> 00:09.928
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:15.125 --> 00:24.100
You have to know that truth is what it is.

00:24.391 --> 00:29.539
We cannot conceptualize it with our human
awareness.

00:29.578 --> 00:38.292
We cannot order it, we cannot manipulate it,
we cannot organize it.

00:38.292 --> 00:42.974
It is what it is, has been and will be.

00:42.974 --> 00:45.872
And what is the truth?

00:45.872 --> 00:59.471
Truth is that we are surrounded or we are
penetrated or we are nourished, looked after

00:59.471 --> 01:13.572
and loved by a very subtle energy which is
the energy of divine love.

01:13.572 --> 01:26.942
The second truth is that we are not this body,
this mind, these conditionings, this ego,

01:26.942 --> 01:33.322
but we are the spirit.

01:33.322 --> 01:41.952
You don’t have to accept what I’m saying
blindly, because blind faith leads to fanaticism.

01:41.952 --> 01:51.611
But as scientists you must keep your minds
open and see for yourself what I’m saying:

01:51.611 --> 02:03.712
if it is so, honestly you must accept it.

02:03.712 --> 02:19.120
We know so much through science about our
civilization, our advancement.

02:19.120 --> 02:27.492
This is the advancement of a tree which has
grown outside very much; but if we do not

02:27.492 --> 02:35.592
know our roots, we’ll be destroyed.

02:35.592 --> 02:41.042
So it is important to know about our roots.

02:41.042 --> 02:47.872
And this is what it is that I would say are
our roots.

02:47.872 --> 03:11.482
As you can see, there are seven centers within
us, and these subtle centers are placed in

03:11.482 --> 03:18.651
the spinal cord and the brain.

03:18.651 --> 03:25.151
These cater to our physical, mental, emotional
and spiritual needs.

03:25.151 --> 03:35.882
On the physical side they manifest the energy
for the use of our plexuses which look after

03:35.882 --> 03:38.241
our physical problems.

03:38.241 --> 03:51.901
That is on the right side, the energy which
is supplied by this yellow line, a subtle

03:51.901 --> 04:02.312
channel – we call it as the Pingala Nadi
– this supplies energy for our physical

04:02.312 --> 04:06.042
and mental actions.

04:06.042 --> 04:15.372
So this is the power of action within us which
also caters to the right sympathetic nervous

04:15.372 --> 04:18.312
system.

04:18.312 --> 04:27.422
The another channel you see on the left-hand
side is the channel by which we desire, put

04:27.422 --> 04:30.042
our energy to our desire.

04:30.042 --> 04:37.132
So this is the power of desire and looks after
our emotions.

04:37.132 --> 04:44.012
This is the one which looks after our conditionings
also.

04:44.012 --> 04:54.222
At the end of these two channels they create
two institutions: one on the right side crosses

04:54.222 --> 05:01.842
over, and the yellow balloon that you see
is the ego, is the balloon of ego that we

05:01.842 --> 05:11.002
have; and the left-hand side one that, which
conditions our mind is the balloon of superego.

05:11.002 --> 05:19.972
As we start growing, in age by the time we
are twelve years of age, these two completely

05:19.972 --> 05:31.412
meet and the soft bone in our head becomes
completely calcified.

05:31.412 --> 05:45.472
Now there’s third energy within us which
is in the center, and this central energy

05:45.472 --> 05:49.991
is the one which has made us human beings.

05:49.991 --> 05:57.182
And these centers are the milestones of our
evolution.

05:57.182 --> 06:04.742
So now the last jumping is left out.

06:04.742 --> 06:09.882
It has reached up to the limbic area.

06:09.882 --> 06:29.712
Now, only thing, it has to break through the
soft bone in the, on the head and break through

06:29.712 --> 06:36.122
that, which is the actualization of baptism.

06:36.122 --> 06:44.372
Baptism is not an artificial thing – it
is an actualization.

06:44.372 --> 06:58.222
But the energy that does it is, we call it
sleeping energy, in the triangular bone called

06:58.222 --> 06:59.782
as sacrum.

06:59.782 --> 07:08.522
That means the Greeks knew that this is a
sacred bone, that they called it “sacrum.”

07:08.522 --> 07:18.512
This energy has to rise and break through
that fontanel bone area and connect us to

07:18.512 --> 07:28.772
that subtle divine Power which we have never
felt during human awareness.

07:28.772 --> 07:42.122
Thus we get connected to this divine Power,
and we start feeling it on our fingertips.

07:42.122 --> 07:50.642
It’s described in the Koran that “at the
time of resurrection your hands will speak,

07:50.642 --> 07:54.442
and they will give witness against you.”

07:54.442 --> 07:59.632
That is, you start feeling your own centers
– these are five, six and seven centers

07:59.632 --> 08:08.782
– and they indicate what’s wrong with
you within yourself, what’s the problem.

08:08.782 --> 08:19.101
Also you can feel the cool breeze coming out
of your head, cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

08:19.101 --> 08:29.692
Because this sleeping power which is called
as the kundalini – “kundala” means “coils”

08:29.692 --> 08:36.142
– is the power of pure desire within us.

08:36.142 --> 08:45.392
[Disturbance by a man in the audience]

08:45.392 --> 08:49.362
What’s he talking?

08:49.362 --> 09:00.752
Ah …. This is the result, you know, of tensions,
on modern tensions.

09:00.752 --> 09:04.351
So many such things are happening.

09:04.351 --> 09:05.372
People have no peace.

09:05.372 --> 09:16.372
That’s what I say, the tree has outgrown
itself: it must find its roots.

09:16.372 --> 09:23.582
In America they say there are fifty-five per
cent people who suffer from terrible nervousness,

09:23.582 --> 09:29.122
and at least thirty per cent people have got
schizophrenia.

09:29.122 --> 09:35.733
It’s a very dangerous thing.

09:35.758 --> 09:43.471
If we don’t understand how delicately we
are made and to realize that we are human

09:43.471 --> 09:52.151
beings, the epitome of evolution, we are going
to land in great difficulties.

09:52.151 --> 10:00.432
We may try to run away from reality, but reality
will have an effect on us.

10:00.432 --> 10:10.022
Now, so now we have this kind of a mechanism
within us existing.

10:10.022 --> 10:18.541
Now this is a living process of evolution,
and you must understand that we don’t pay

10:18.541 --> 10:27.692
for living process, and we can’t even explain
it; because when you take a small little seed

10:27.692 --> 10:34.221
and put it in the Mother Earth, it germinates
by itself spontaneously.

10:34.221 --> 10:39.582
You don’t pay to the Mother Earth anything.

10:39.582 --> 10:48.211
And when it germinates, it grows into a tree
and produces thousands of seeds.

10:48.211 --> 10:56.822
So in that little seed the map of all the
things it was going to create is there.

10:56.822 --> 11:00.791
How it works, we never ask this question.

11:00.791 --> 11:03.262
We take all the things for granted.

11:03.262 --> 11:10.932
We don’t even ask the question how this
wonderful eye of ours is made like a camera,

11:10.932 --> 11:16.852
and that how we are programmed within ourselves
like computers.

11:16.852 --> 11:23.152
You see this is the color; you don’t have
to think about – it’s there.

11:23.152 --> 11:36.091
Through our sensory organs, how we find out
things: we’d never question it.

11:36.091 --> 11:45.602
But to answer now all our questions, we have
to become the divine computer.

11:45.602 --> 11:51.442
And that’s why we have to be connected to
the mains, I call them, as the people who

11:51.442 --> 12:03.872
are self-realized, the people who have got
their spirit in their attention.

12:03.872 --> 12:13.732
When the attention is enlightened through
this happening, then you can see the absolute

12:13.732 --> 12:14.982
truth.

12:14.982 --> 12:22.382
Like supposing you are holding on to a snake
and there’s darkness, and somebody tells,

12:22.382 --> 12:29.152
there is darkness, “But you have got a snake
in your hand.

12:29.152 --> 12:30.541
I can see it.”

12:30.541 --> 12:34.771
He’ll say, “No, I think it is a rope.”

12:34.771 --> 12:42.302
Now if you put on the light, immediately that
person will drop.

12:42.302 --> 12:49.901
In the same way, when the attention gets enlightened
by the spirit, the first nature, innate nature

12:49.901 --> 12:56.901
of the spirit is that it manifests absolute
truth.

12:56.901 --> 13:03.372
You immediately become so empowered that you
give up all those habits which are destructive

13:03.372 --> 13:05.732
to your life – immediately.

13:05.732 --> 13:13.232
I have seen people giving up drugs overnight
in London, alcoholism, all kinds of things.

13:13.232 --> 13:19.002
I was amazed the way it’s working.

13:19.002 --> 13:27.432
It’s your own power within you; it just
there, is existing.

13:27.432 --> 13:35.632
There’s no obligation of any kind, it’s
just one enlightened candle can enlighten

13:35.632 --> 13:37.052
another candle.

13:37.052 --> 13:39.992
That’s how it works.

13:39.992 --> 13:46.762
And it has to work – otherwise, as I told
you, we are standing on the brink of destruction.

13:46.762 --> 13:55.382
Leave alone things like drugs and things we
take to escape reality, there are so many

13:55.382 --> 14:06.172
diseases that have come up and coming up that
it is going to be very difficult for us to

14:06.172 --> 14:16.802
exist on this Mother Earth after some time:
ecological problems, the uncertainty of life,

14:16.802 --> 14:22.012
the insecurities that are built within us.

14:22.012 --> 14:26.432
So many conditionings we have.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.752
How to get rid of them?

14:28.752 --> 14:33.041
How to be cleansed is a very big problem today.

14:33.041 --> 14:41.072
And for that I think it is important that
we have to get our Self-realization.

14:41.072 --> 14:51.291
We talk, “my, my body, my hand, my mind,
my ego” – but which is this “my”?

14:51.291 --> 14:54.062
Which is the “I” behind it?

14:54.062 --> 14:59.182
And when doctors also talk about the autonomous
nervous system, they don’t say what is this

14:59.182 --> 15:00.662
auto, who is this auto.

15:00.662 --> 15:05.412
We say “automobile” – so there is a
driver sitting driving the car.

15:05.412 --> 15:08.782
But who is driving this car?

15:08.782 --> 15:12.822
That is what we have to find out.

15:12.822 --> 15:16.782
And that auto is the spirit within us.

15:16.782 --> 15:27.012
Unless and until the connection with the Divine
is established, all other efforts are really

15:27.012 --> 15:28.042
fruitless.

15:28.042 --> 15:33.142
And that’s why many people ask Me why all
the religions are fighting among themselves,

15:33.142 --> 15:40.762
why people who believe in God are fighting
among themselves; why they are so sinful,

15:40.762 --> 15:42.142
why aren’t they so good.

15:42.142 --> 15:48.012
The reason is, they have not found the truth
as yet.

15:48.012 --> 15:54.242
Just believing in any God or being born in
any religion doesn’t make you a righteous

15:54.242 --> 15:59.752
person at all: anybody following any religion
can commit any sin.

15:59.752 --> 16:01.441
There’s no bondage.

16:01.441 --> 16:07.232
But when this kundalini rises into that green
part, as you see – we call it as a Void:

16:07.232 --> 16:10.272
is the area which is like a bridging.

16:10.272 --> 16:18.332
Very significant it is, like Moses bridged;
in the same way, this is the bridging.

16:18.332 --> 16:23.842
And this bridging, when it takes place you
can cross over this ocean of illusion, as

16:23.842 --> 16:25.252
we say.

16:25.252 --> 16:32.662
But actually this ocean of illusion is representing
our ten valencies within us.

16:32.662 --> 16:43.912
We have ten valencies, ten dharmas, ten – our
innate nature as human beings.

16:43.912 --> 16:49.652
So when kundalini rises into this area, it
enlightens this area, and a person who is

16:49.652 --> 16:52.652
a realized soul doesn’t do anything wrong.

16:52.652 --> 16:57.921
He doesn’t cheat, he doesn’t bribes, he’s
not frightened.

16:57.921 --> 17:06.892
He’s so courageous, he’s so compassionate,
he’s so dynamic, he’s so loving.

17:06.892 --> 17:13.272
This is only possible when you are innately
religious.

17:13.272 --> 17:18.772
Unless and until that happens, the religion
outside, the man-made religion, cannot give

17:18.772 --> 17:21.612
you what it is promising you.

17:21.612 --> 17:25.821
And that’s why people are surprised that
there is a big difference between the practice

17:25.821 --> 17:28.362
and precepts of religion.

17:28.362 --> 17:34.752
Every religion has said that “you seek your
Self.”

17:34.752 --> 17:40.342
So there was nothing wrong with all the prophets,
incarnations, all the saints.

17:40.342 --> 17:44.232
They all said the same thing.

17:44.232 --> 17:48.122
But we have missed the point.

17:48.122 --> 17:57.762
Everything has become either money-oriented
or is an intellectual, intellectual probing.

17:57.762 --> 18:03.292
It is through intellectual probing you reach
a point where you realize that you have not

18:03.292 --> 18:04.582
reached the reality.

18:04.582 --> 18:10.852
So what should we do?

18:10.852 --> 18:16.072
And this is a very great gift of modern times
which was promised long time back.

18:16.072 --> 18:25.051
Is described already in our Puranas that at
the time, these modern times called as Kali

18:25.051 --> 18:33.071
Yuga, the Paramachaitanya or this all-pervading
Power will become active – means there is

18:33.071 --> 18:42.472
Krita Yuga, it will become active – and
through it thousands of people will get their

18:42.472 --> 18:44.652
realization.

18:44.652 --> 18:48.742
Even in the Bible they have said that it’s
quite a limited number.

18:48.742 --> 18:56.252
John the – John has written in his “Revelation”
it’s quite a limited number, but we have

18:56.252 --> 18:59.931
already crossed that.

18:59.931 --> 19:03.392
And so many people have to become realized
souls.

19:03.392 --> 19:10.362
It’s very important today, and it’s so
easy – Sahaja.

19:10.362 --> 19:12.992
“Saha” is “with”, “ja” is “born.”

19:12.992 --> 19:20.382
Born with you is the right to become one with
the Divine, united with the Divine – that

19:20.382 --> 19:21.972
is yoga.

19:21.972 --> 19:26.992
“Yoga” is nothing but to be united with
that divine Power.

19:26.992 --> 19:35.362
That’s what yoga is; all other things are
subsidiary.

19:35.362 --> 19:45.762
This union brings forth new dimensions on
our central nervous system.

19:45.762 --> 19:51.162
As a evolution, we always develop a new dimension.

19:51.162 --> 20:02.532
By this you develop a new awareness of collective
consciousness, by which you can feel other

20:02.532 --> 20:05.571
people, their centers.

20:05.571 --> 20:11.262
Sitting down here you can feel the center
of somebody – somebody who is dead, even

20:11.262 --> 20:16.112
you can feel his centers and find out what
he was: was he a realized soul or not?

20:16.112 --> 20:21.252
You can find out about anybody whether he
was a realized soul or not, sitting down here.

20:21.252 --> 20:23.212
You have to just think about him, put your
hands.

20:23.212 --> 20:30.071
If you are a realized soul you can feel on
your fingertips what is the problem.

20:30.071 --> 20:36.222
And somehow if you know how to correct those
problems, you get rid of your own diseases

20:36.222 --> 20:44.262
and the diseases of others, your own problems
and the problems of others.

20:44.262 --> 20:52.012
First you enter into a state of mind which
we call as “thoughtless awareness.”

20:52.012 --> 21:00.032
When you cross this center of Agnya that is
placed in the optic chiasma, you become thoughtlessly

21:00.032 --> 21:01.032
aware.

21:01.032 --> 21:04.232
You are aware, but there is no thought.

21:04.232 --> 21:07.972
What a blessing it is!

21:07.972 --> 21:14.571
Say, I see a carpet here, it’s beautiful,
and when I look at it if I start thinking

21:14.571 --> 21:15.571
“what a good carpet!”

21:15.571 --> 21:19.672
If it is Mine it’s a very big headache because
I’ll be thinking, “I hope it goes home,

21:19.672 --> 21:26.992
is already insured, is not lost, is not spoilt”
– all kinds of worries about this carpet.

21:26.992 --> 21:32.571
Thank God it’s not Mine, so I’ll look
at it, still I start thinking how much I should

21:32.571 --> 21:37.571
pay to get it, from where can I get it; all
these thoughts coming.

21:37.571 --> 21:46.982
But if I look at it without any thoughts,
then the joy of its creation, to whomsoever

21:46.982 --> 22:00.212
it may belong, so-called, starts pouring on
Me like beautiful flow of joy.

22:00.212 --> 22:11.722
Whatever the artist has put into it, all his
joy starts pouring, that peace and that joyous

22:11.722 --> 22:16.632
feeling within Me when I don’t think about
it.

22:16.632 --> 22:22.002
Thinking makes a person mad, creates lots
of problems.

22:22.002 --> 22:24.821
Too much thinking is wasteful, also.

22:24.821 --> 22:32.571
As I’ll tell you about the second center
we have here, tomorrow, about the second center,

22:32.571 --> 22:36.952
that by thinking, how many diseases you get.

22:36.952 --> 22:48.291
The other day I was in a radio station and
the gentleman was asking Me, “How can I

22:48.291 --> 22:49.691
get rid of my diabetes?

22:49.691 --> 22:51.612
You say that by thinking it happens.”

22:51.612 --> 22:55.071
I said, “Yes.”

22:55.071 --> 23:02.472
Because in India if they have to take tea
in a village, the sugar is put so much that

23:02.472 --> 23:06.952
the spoon must stand at right angle!

23:06.952 --> 23:09.571
And nobody gets diabetes.

23:09.571 --> 23:19.962
But people who are sedentary, planning too
much – I mean mostly, say, bureaucrats,

23:19.962 --> 23:26.311
diplomats, politicians – they are very vulnerable.

23:26.311 --> 23:30.952
What is the reason for that, which I’ll
explain to you tomorrow, how we get all these

23:30.952 --> 23:39.922
diseases because we think too much and we
cannot stop thinking.

23:39.922 --> 23:48.102
But so far, we have to understand that we
are all on the, either on the right side or

23:48.102 --> 23:51.052
on the left side.

23:51.052 --> 23:54.942
We are not in the center.

23:54.942 --> 24:01.852
The centers are like this, I would say: the
left and the right, and the left side and

24:01.852 --> 24:05.352
the right side join together to make the center.

24:05.352 --> 24:09.791
Now supposing you are right-sided – means
you are using too much of your physical or

24:09.791 --> 24:18.712
mental aptitudes, you are planning for future,
you are very futuristic – then this starts

24:18.712 --> 24:25.541
extracting energy from this center and starts
moving to the left, right, starts moving to

24:25.541 --> 24:27.702
the right.

24:27.702 --> 24:37.282
At the same time if something happens on the
left side and you get a jerk, it is broken.

24:37.282 --> 24:43.402
Then you are vulnerable to diseases which
we call as psychosomatic, because this is

24:43.402 --> 24:47.882
the one is the somatic and this is the psycho.

24:47.882 --> 24:55.411
And these diseases cannot be cured.

24:55.411 --> 25:02.181
Because if somebody’s a doctor then he doesn’t
know about psychology; somebody is psychologist,

25:02.181 --> 25:03.502
he doesn’t know the medicine.

25:03.502 --> 25:07.332
I mean, we have doctors for one eye and another
doctor for another eye!

25:07.332 --> 25:10.642
We have gone to that limit of specialization.

25:10.642 --> 25:18.571
This is the science of integration.

25:18.571 --> 25:25.602
Is not a science of specialization but integration,
because this is one body which has got the

25:25.602 --> 25:30.412
nose, eyes, ears all stuck to one body.

25:30.412 --> 25:36.832
And this is one personality, and we have to
deal with this personality as a whole.

25:36.832 --> 25:42.012
But if you start treating it like one for
the nose, one for the ears, it’s not going

25:42.012 --> 25:44.311
to work out.

25:44.311 --> 25:51.892
So when this kundalini rises through these
centers it brings them back to normal, to

25:51.892 --> 26:01.612
the balance, integrates them one with another
and connects them with the mains from where

26:01.612 --> 26:05.772
the energy flows inside.

26:05.772 --> 26:12.762
And that’s how you become very dynamic,
you don’t get tired, you feel very young,

26:12.762 --> 26:24.541
you never feel your age; and you are extremely
compassionate and kind, and you love to do

26:24.541 --> 26:27.041
good to others.

26:27.041 --> 26:32.772
It is so much I have to tell you.

26:32.772 --> 26:38.082
Now Sahaja Yoga is working in forty nations,
and working out very well.

26:38.082 --> 26:41.052
The most surprising place was USSR.

26:41.052 --> 26:45.622
And now the people are saying, “Mother,
You have been working for twenty years in

26:45.622 --> 26:51.862
the West and only went last year to USSR,
and You have more Sahaja yogis there than

26:51.862 --> 26:54.392
You have all over the world.”

26:54.392 --> 26:58.142
Not in India: we have many more, of course,
because they know about it, they were not

26:58.142 --> 27:00.842
ignorant, so it’s all right – if you forget
India.

27:00.842 --> 27:09.852
I don’t know what’s so special about them
that they could see this so clearly.

27:09.852 --> 27:14.972
And one of the snags of Sahaja Yoga is that
you cannot pay for it.

27:14.972 --> 27:22.872
And this really is the very great snag, I
think, because a gentleman from BBC in England

27:22.872 --> 27:30.912
told Me that Anglo-Saxon brain cannot understand
anything that can be done without money.

27:30.912 --> 27:34.452
I said, “Who has made this brain, God or
somebody else?”

27:34.452 --> 27:38.411
It’s very surprising!

27:38.411 --> 27:45.051
And even in, I went to Toronto – no, Boston
– and they said, “How many Rolls-Royces

27:45.051 --> 27:46.051
You’ve got?”

27:46.051 --> 27:49.982
I said, “I have none, because I don’t
take any money.

27:49.982 --> 27:52.122
Whatever I have is of My husband’s.”

27:52.122 --> 27:55.652
They said, “Then we are not interested.

27:55.652 --> 27:57.472
You have to be in the business.”

27:57.472 --> 28:03.801
It’s very shocking, this kind of a attitude
towards Divine.

28:03.801 --> 28:12.821
I said, “How much money did you pay to Christ?”

28:12.821 --> 28:19.412
Today also there was a question from a radio,
and they asked Me, “You don’t take any

28:19.412 --> 28:21.902
money; then how do You travel?”

28:21.902 --> 28:28.821
I said, “So far, for quite some time I was
travelling with My husband’s money, no doubt.

28:28.821 --> 28:34.281
But now we have so many Sahaja yogis and they
have some self-respect, and they don’t pay

28:34.281 --> 28:38.412
Me, they pay to the travel agents, not to
Me.

28:38.412 --> 28:44.311
They don’t want I to pay for them – then
tomorrow will say ‘all right, You pay for

28:44.311 --> 28:46.002
our food also!’”

28:46.002 --> 28:51.492
I mean, any self-respecting people can understand
that.

28:51.492 --> 28:57.982
So if somebody does not take money, they go
to that limit that even I should pay for their

28:57.982 --> 29:07.642
salvation, coming to their place I should
pay for the hall, I should pay for everything.

29:07.642 --> 29:15.511
This kind of a brain – oh, it’s not all,
all of you are not Anglo-Saxon, I hope so!

29:15.511 --> 29:20.071
– I can’t understand.

29:20.071 --> 29:22.742
And that’s why it has not come up to the
point where it should have.

29:22.742 --> 29:35.012
On the contrary, I must say Russians are very
brave people.

29:35.012 --> 29:40.555
With the war they have become very strong.

29:40.633 --> 29:46.811
On the contrary, in other countries I have
seen with the war they have become very nervous,

29:46.811 --> 29:49.212
very frightened.

29:49.212 --> 29:54.352
And immediately they took to Sahaja Yoga for
one point, that you cannot pay for it.

29:54.352 --> 30:01.102
They could see it, that you can’t pay because
it’s a living process.

30:01.102 --> 30:04.322
Is such a wisdom that clicked.

30:04.322 --> 30:16.171
You won’t believe, in England I was fighting
with seven hippies for four years: the questions,

30:16.171 --> 30:19.372
the bombardment and – too much!

30:19.372 --> 30:23.952
I was about to give up.

30:23.952 --> 30:30.342
They just thought that it’s something to
be attacked.

30:30.342 --> 30:34.468
And that’s the reason they attacked all
the saints, all the incarnations and all the

30:34.493 --> 30:36.463
prophets.

30:40.460 --> 30:45.679
But I hope now everybody realizes that we
are in trouble.

30:45.679 --> 30:48.569
We are all in trouble.

30:48.569 --> 30:51.110
We don’t know what’s going to happen next
day.

30:51.110 --> 30:57.439
We might get into cancer, might get into some
other trouble.

30:57.439 --> 31:01.169
We might have any problem that we do not know
about.

31:01.169 --> 31:04.750
We are not sure of our future.

31:04.750 --> 31:11.000
So it is better that we get our special energy
that is within us, we get ourselves enlightened

31:11.000 --> 31:24.810
and take to something that will make us much
wiser, healthier, joyous and knowledgeable.

31:24.810 --> 31:29.240
“Knowledge” does not mean what you know
through your brains, but on your central nervous

31:29.240 --> 31:30.760
system.

31:30.760 --> 31:41.540
That’s what everybody said, that the time
has come – it’s a blossom time, I call

31:41.540 --> 31:42.540
it.

31:42.540 --> 31:46.779
There are thousands and thousands who can
get realization.

31:46.779 --> 31:53.240
It’s such a great blessing that we could
have en masse realization.

31:53.240 --> 31:58.010
On the Tree of Life there would have been
only one or two flowers to begin with, but

31:58.010 --> 32:02.159
today I call it a blossom time.

32:02.159 --> 32:13.390
Is actually the Day of Judgment, but “blossom
time” seems better to say – is more promising.

32:13.390 --> 32:19.438
I hope tonight we all will get realization
and enjoy ourselves.

32:19.642 --> 32:30.191
May God bless you all.

32:33.172 --> 32:45.392
Spirit is the source of knowledge, absolute
knowledge; is the source of peace, is the

32:45.392 --> 33:00.392
source of wisdom, is the source of joy, is
the source that enlightens our attention.

33:00.392 --> 33:04.812
We have such a big property with us.

33:04.812 --> 33:11.082
We should allow it to enlighten us, shouldn’t
we?

33:11.082 --> 33:18.222
Now I think we should stop the questions,
because there’s one thing: I’m quite good

33:18.222 --> 33:20.002
at answering questions.

33:20.002 --> 33:29.122
I’ll answer all your questions, but by that
I cannot guarantee your realization.

33:29.122 --> 33:34.042
I can answer most of your questions, but I
can’t guarantee your realization.

33:34.042 --> 33:36.722
Realization has to work out.

33:36.722 --> 33:41.122
So even if you have not been able to ask some
question, forget it.

33:41.122 --> 33:47.642
You can bring them tomorrow written down,
and I would like to answer them when you come

33:47.642 --> 33:49.162
tomorrow.

33:49.162 --> 33:50.582
Beforehand if you give, I’ll answer them.

33:50.582 --> 33:54.412
But just now I think, tell your mind not to
bother you any more about questions.

33:54.412 --> 33:59.322
And that’s why I wanted you to ask questions,
so that your mind should not suddenly come

33:59.322 --> 34:02.432
out like jack-in-the-box and say, “Oh, you
didn’t ask this question.

34:02.432 --> 34:05.432
How can you have realization?”

34:05.432 --> 34:14.692
So the most important thing is to get your
realization.

34:14.692 --> 34:17.332
So I think, let us have it now.

34:17.332 --> 34:20.222
Again, I cannot force on you.

34:20.222 --> 34:25.242
You have to have it in your free will.

34:25.242 --> 34:28.422
So please, those who want to have should be
there.

34:28.422 --> 34:35.182
It will take hardly ten minutes to work it
out, and then tomorrow again I’m going to

34:35.182 --> 34:36.922
work it out.

34:36.922 --> 34:40.922
It’s very simple, very easy.

34:40.922 --> 34:45.082
But those who don’t want to have it should
not be in the hall.

34:45.082 --> 34:47.472
It’s not proper, it’s not civil.

34:47.472 --> 34:51.892
So all those who want to have it, are welcome.

34:51.892 --> 35:10.122
At the very outset, at the very outset there
are two conditions I have to tell you.

35:10.122 --> 35:16.432
First one, as I told you before also, you
have to forget the past.

35:16.432 --> 35:22.622
You have to forgive yourself, and know that
you are not guilty at all.

35:22.622 --> 35:28.922
All these ideas are given to you that you
are sinful, you are guilty, you are this and

35:28.922 --> 35:32.622
that because they wanted to cash it.

35:32.622 --> 35:39.151
You don’t have to suffer either.

35:39.191 --> 35:45.391
So first of all you should know that you must
forgive yourself and must have self-esteem

35:45.391 --> 35:51.721
and you should be very pleasantly placed towards
yourself, because you are going to enter into

35:51.721 --> 35:53.261
the Kingdom of God.

35:53.261 --> 35:58.661
This is the first condition.

35:58.661 --> 36:05.501
Now the second condition is that you have
to forgive everyone.

36:06.426 --> 36:11.550
Some will say it’s very difficult to forgive.

36:11.575 --> 36:17.077
But whether you forgive or don’t forgive,
you don’t do anything.

36:17.351 --> 36:18.701
It’s a myth.

36:18.701 --> 36:24.651
But if you don’t forgive then you really
play into the hands of the people who want

36:24.651 --> 36:26.381
to torture you.

36:26.381 --> 36:29.051
So best is to forgive them, forget about them.

36:29.051 --> 36:31.341
Forgive and forget.

36:31.341 --> 36:35.011
But don’t start counting how many people
I have to forgive, what mistakes they have

36:35.011 --> 36:36.381
done – nothing of the kind.

36:36.381 --> 36:42.047
Just in general say “I forgive everyone”
– just, and it’s done.

36:42.072 --> 36:47.954
Because Divine is the ocean of forgiveness,
it’s a very powerful ocean of forgiveness,

36:47.985 --> 36:51.335
and you cannot do anything that it cannot
forgive.

36:51.335 --> 36:58.045
And once you say “I forgive,” Divine takes
over; we don’t have to bother.

36:59.324 --> 37:00.845
All right?

37:00.870 --> 37:05.985
These are the two conditions we have; very
simple conditions, I think.

37:05.985 --> 37:09.790
We have to take out our shoes to take the
help of the Mother Earth.

37:09.815 --> 37:11.275
That’s very important.

37:11.315 --> 37:17.185
You have to put your left hand towards Me
like this, in a comfortable way, on your – you

37:17.185 --> 37:23.555
can keep it on your lap, whatever is comfortable.

37:23.555 --> 37:29.125
Now this represents that you desire to have
your realization.

37:29.125 --> 37:31.025
So you keep it all the time like this.

37:31.025 --> 37:35.665
And with the right hand we’ll nourish our
centers.

37:35.665 --> 37:40.405
With the right hand we will nourish our centers.

37:40.405 --> 37:45.075
And so you will know also how to raise your
kundalini yourself.

37:45.075 --> 37:52.835
So two things can be done: your kundalini
will be raised; as well as you will feel,

37:52.835 --> 37:59.025
you will know how to feel your centers within
yourself and how to correct them.

37:59.025 --> 38:04.945
We’ll be working only on the left-hand side.

38:04.945 --> 38:07.115
So now you have to put the left hand towards
Me.

38:07.115 --> 38:15.885
First I’ll show you, he will show you what
is to be done, and then you’ll have to close

38:15.885 --> 38:20.875
your eyes later on.

38:20.875 --> 38:25.805
First we’ll put our hand on our heart.

38:25.805 --> 38:35.985
In the heart resides the spirit.

38:35.985 --> 38:43.935
Then we’ll have to put our hand on the upper
portion of our abdomen, on the left-hand side.

38:43.935 --> 38:51.545
This is the center of your mastery, created
by great masters.

38:51.545 --> 38:56.675
Then you have to take your right hand in the
lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand

38:56.675 --> 39:04.705
side, which is a very important center which
manifests this pure knowledge on your central

39:04.705 --> 39:10.225
nervous system.

39:10.225 --> 39:23.575
Then you have to raise your hand higher, again
on to the left side of your abdomen, on the

39:23.575 --> 39:24.575
upper part.

39:24.575 --> 39:27.625
Press it hard, on the center of mastery.

39:27.625 --> 39:32.525
Then to your heart again.

39:32.525 --> 39:43.415
And then on to the corner between your neck
and your shoulder – from the front side,

39:43.415 --> 39:48.615
not from the back but from the front side
– and turn your head to your right.

39:48.615 --> 39:54.755
Now this center is very important, because
this catches on very much, specially in the

39:54.755 --> 39:58.245
West, because people all the time feel guilty.

39:58.245 --> 40:05.495
And because of this people get spondylitis
and angina and all other lethargic organs

40:05.495 --> 40:06.555
diseases.

40:06.555 --> 40:15.485
So please put your hand here, as far back
as possible, and turn your head to your right.

40:15.485 --> 40:26.745
Now, take your right hand and put it on your
forehead across and try to put your head down

40:26.745 --> 40:31.005
slowly, resting on this hand.

40:31.005 --> 40:42.035
And now press it on both the sides, as we
do it when we have headache.

40:42.035 --> 40:44.225
This is the center for forgiving others.

40:44.225 --> 40:51.785
Then you have to take down your hand, take
up your hand onto the back side of your head

40:51.785 --> 40:55.055
where the optic lobe is, here at the back.

40:55.055 --> 41:04.025
And now turn your head upward as far as possible,
resting on your hand.

41:04.025 --> 41:09.135
This is the center where you have to ask for
forgiveness from the Divine without feeling

41:09.135 --> 41:12.655
guilty – is for your satisfaction.

41:12.655 --> 41:21.805
Now, stretch your hand, stretch your palm
and put the center of your palm just on top

41:21.805 --> 41:27.875
of the fontanel bone area, which was the soft
bone in your childhood.

41:27.875 --> 41:36.485
And now bend your head, please, downward as
much as possible.

41:36.485 --> 41:40.405
Push back your fingers, push back as much
as possible.

41:40.405 --> 41:44.095
Now there will be a pressure on the scalp.

41:44.095 --> 41:49.975
Now move this pressure on the scalp slowly
clockwise, seven times.

41:49.975 --> 41:57.565
You have to move the scalp, not your hand
so much as the scalp, seven times clockwise,

41:57.565 --> 41:59.635
slowly.

41:59.635 --> 42:02.925
Bend your head.

42:02.925 --> 42:13.185
That’s what we’ll have to do.

42:13.185 --> 42:15.025
That’s all, nothing more.

42:15.025 --> 42:18.635
That’s the only thing we have to do.

42:18.635 --> 42:23.315
Now, you can take out your spectacles if you
want because you’re closing your eyes, and

42:23.315 --> 42:28.725
might help your eyesight also.

42:28.725 --> 42:34.265
Now, put your left hand towards Me, comfortably.

42:34.265 --> 42:37.865
Put your feet apart from each other.

42:37.865 --> 42:51.515
And now put your right hand on your heart
and close your eyes.

42:51.515 --> 42:58.475
Here you have to ask Me a very important question,
in your heart.

42:58.475 --> 43:02.165
You ask Me a question as you would ask a computer.

43:02.165 --> 43:08.515
You can call Me “Shri Mataji” or “Mother”,
whatever you like.

43:08.515 --> 43:11.395
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

43:11.395 --> 43:13.785
Ask the question, in your heart, not loudly.

43:13.785 --> 43:23.435
Three times ask in your heart, not loudly,
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

43:23.435 --> 43:35.015
You have to only ask in your heart.

43:35.015 --> 43:41.035
If you are the spirit you become your own
guide, you become your own master, you become

43:41.035 --> 43:44.865
your own guru.

43:44.865 --> 43:51.135
So now take down your right hand into the
upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand

43:51.135 --> 43:54.905
side.

43:54.905 --> 44:06.575
And here you have to ask another question,
three times, not loudly, in your heart, “Mother,

44:06.575 --> 44:08.695
am I the spirit?”

44:08.695 --> 44:09.695
– ah!

44:09.695 --> 44:11.955
“Mother, am I my own master?

44:11.955 --> 44:14.865
Mother, am I my own master?”

44:14.865 --> 44:28.995
Ask this question three times.

44:28.995 --> 44:38.025
“Am I my own master?”

44:38.025 --> 44:50.865
I have told you that I respect your freedom,
and the pure knowledge cannot be forced on

44:50.865 --> 44:52.555
you.

44:52.555 --> 45:04.565
So please take your right hand in the lower
portion of your abdomen, and say it six times,

45:04.565 --> 45:10.655
asking Me, “Mother, please give me pure
knowledge.”

45:10.655 --> 45:12.685
I cannot force on you.

45:12.685 --> 45:22.485
You have to ask in your free will.

45:22.485 --> 45:42.685
As soon as you ask for the pure knowledge,
the kundalini starts moving upward.

45:42.685 --> 45:55.715
So now we have to nourish the higher centers
with our self-confidence.

45:55.715 --> 46:04.455
Raise your right hand in the upper portion
of your abdomen.

46:04.455 --> 46:09.425
Press it hard, on the left-hand side.

46:09.425 --> 46:17.055
And here with full confidence you have to
say ten times, in your heart, not loudly,

46:17.055 --> 46:20.305
“Mother, I am my own master.”

46:20.305 --> 46:47.425
Please say this ten times, “Mother, I am
my own master.”

46:47.425 --> 46:55.015
I told you at the very outset that the greatest
truth about you is that you are not this body,

46:55.015 --> 47:05.115
you are not this mind, you are not these conditionings,
emotions, nor this ego, but you are the spirit.

47:05.115 --> 47:08.455
You are the pure spirit.

47:08.455 --> 47:28.225
So now raise your right hand onto your heart
and ask here, or say with full confidence,

47:28.225 --> 47:32.365
twelve times, “Mother, I am the spirit.”

47:32.365 --> 47:40.675
Just say it without any hesitation.

47:40.675 --> 47:55.215
Say it twelve times, please.

47:55.215 --> 48:12.145
For your information you have to know that
the divine Power is the source of knowledge,

48:12.145 --> 48:17.895
is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of
love.

48:17.895 --> 48:26.085
It is the ocean of peace and ocean of bliss.

48:26.085 --> 48:31.635
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

48:31.635 --> 48:37.955
So you cannot commit any mistake which cannot
be dissolved by the power of this ocean of

48:37.955 --> 48:40.385
forgiveness.

48:40.385 --> 48:49.285
So please raise your right hand in the corner
of your neck, on your shoulder, push it back

48:49.285 --> 48:56.205
as much as possible and turn your head to
your right, and with full confidence please

48:56.205 --> 49:21.225
say sixteen times, full confidence, in your
heart, “Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

49:21.225 --> 49:30.555
All right.

49:30.555 --> 49:39.675
As I told you before that you have to forgive
everyone, and those who say it is difficult,

49:39.675 --> 49:44.725
they must know that it is a myth whether you
forgive or don’t forgive.

49:44.725 --> 49:51.815
But if you don’t forgive then you play into
the wrong hands and get yourself tortured

49:51.815 --> 49:53.605
by yourself.

49:53.605 --> 49:58.695
So please forgive – in general, everyone,
not counting how many people you have to forgive,

49:58.695 --> 50:06.455
what you have to forgive – but just say,
by raising your hand and putting it on top

50:06.455 --> 50:13.215
of your forehead across, putting down your
head as much as possible, resting on your

50:13.215 --> 50:15.795
hand.

50:15.795 --> 50:30.525
Please say, with an open heart please say,
“Mother, I forgive everyone.”

50:30.525 --> 50:40.975
Please say it, please say; otherwise it is
difficult later on for Me: I have to clear

50:40.975 --> 50:45.075
out everybody’s Agnya and this takes too
much time then.

50:45.075 --> 50:47.595
So best is to say it from your heart.

50:47.595 --> 50:56.365
After all, you are not going to miss your
Self-realization for that.

50:56.365 --> 51:07.855
Now take back your right hand on the back
side of your head, and put your head on it,

51:07.855 --> 51:12.945
resting on it, upward.

51:12.945 --> 51:20.585
Here you have to say for your own satisfaction,
“Oh Divine, if I have done any mistakes,

51:20.585 --> 51:21.885
please forgive me.”

51:21.885 --> 51:26.525
But don’t feel guilty, don’t count your
mistakes, don’t think about them.

51:26.525 --> 51:34.955
In general you have to say, “Oh Divine,
please forgive me if I have done any mistakes

51:34.955 --> 51:42.065
or anything wrong, anything against You.”

51:42.065 --> 51:51.165
Now, stretch your palm, stretch your palm
and put the center of your palm on top of

51:51.165 --> 51:57.805
the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone
in your childhood.

51:57.805 --> 52:03.365
Now put down your head properly.

52:03.365 --> 52:08.585
And here push back your fingers as far as
possible.

52:08.585 --> 52:09.585
Please push back.

52:09.585 --> 52:11.385
This is very important.

52:11.385 --> 52:20.815
And now put a pressure on your scalp, and
move your scalp slowly seven times clockwise.

52:20.815 --> 52:28.155
Here again I respect your freedom, and I cannot
force Self-realization on you.

52:28.155 --> 52:35.915
So here you have to say seven times, bending
your head properly and pressing it hard, moving

52:35.915 --> 52:40.005
seven times, “Mother, please give me my
Self-realization.”

52:40.005 --> 52:43.835
Please ask seven times, please.

52:43.835 --> 53:11.425
[Shri Mataji blows into the microphone.]

53:11.425 --> 53:46.515
Now, take down your hands and put them towards
Me, little higher.

53:46.515 --> 53:52.595
Now, little bit put your right hand like this.

53:52.595 --> 54:01.115
Bend your head, and see for yourself if there
is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

54:01.115 --> 54:06.245
But don’t touch it – above your head,
above your head.

54:06.245 --> 54:08.805
And some people get it far.

54:08.805 --> 54:14.485
So just try to feel if there’s a cool breeze
coming out of your head.

54:14.485 --> 54:21.055
Now, don’t start doubting that it’s air-conditioning
and all that – air-conditioning cannot come

54:21.055 --> 54:22.965
out of your head!

54:22.965 --> 54:27.885
So see for yourself.

54:27.885 --> 54:36.725
Now, put
your left hand towards Me.

54:36.725 --> 54:46.455
Now again bend your head, and see for yourself
if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your

54:46.455 --> 54:49.685
head.

54:49.685 --> 54:56.135
All right?

54:56.135 --> 55:03.005
Now put your right hand again, and again bend
your head and see for yourself if there’s

55:03.005 --> 55:05.475
a cool breeze coming out of your head.

55:05.475 --> 55:07.875
It might be hot also, doesn’t matter.

55:07.875 --> 55:11.045
It may be heat coming out first and then the
cool breeze.

55:11.045 --> 55:17.145
Doesn’t matter if it is hot, doesn’t matter.

55:17.145 --> 55:23.925
Now, put your both the hands towards the sky
like this.

55:23.925 --> 55:28.625
Bend back, and ask Me a question.

55:28.625 --> 55:35.175
Three times, you can ask Me the question,
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the

55:35.175 --> 55:36.635
Holy Ghost?

55:36.635 --> 55:41.935
Mother, is this the all-pervading Power of
divine love?

55:41.935 --> 55:45.185
Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?”

55:45.185 --> 55:57.425
Ask any one of these questions three times.

55:57.425 --> 56:02.385
Now put down your hands.

56:02.385 --> 56:05.115
Now watch Me without thinking.

56:05.115 --> 56:11.685
You can do it.

56:11.685 --> 56:19.165
Those who have felt the cool breeze in their
hands or out of their fontanel bone area,

56:19.165 --> 56:26.685
whether cool or hot, please raise both your
hands – both.

56:26.685 --> 56:28.595
Let’s see.

56:28.595 --> 56:32.855
Just see the en masse, just see – wonderful!

56:32.855 --> 56:36.475
So may God bless you all.

56:36.475 --> 56:43.015
I bow to you all, because you have started
now your saintly life.

56:43.015 --> 56:47.155
And all those who didn’t get also should
not get disappointed.

56:47.155 --> 56:53.745
On the contrary, if time permits I would like
to meet the people who have felt the cool

56:53.745 --> 56:58.744
breeze, and those who haven’t felt can come
on this side and the Sahaja yogis can work

56:58.744 --> 57:00.165
on them.

57:00.165 --> 57:04.305
Again tomorrow you must come so you’ll be
fixed properly.

57:04.305 --> 57:10.475
Some, those who want to meet Me can come and
see Me, because there is some time, and in

57:10.475 --> 57:13.145
the meanwhile we can have some music.

57:13.145 --> 57:17.025
Now don’t think about it.

57:17.025 --> 57:19.605
If you start thinking, you’ll be lost.

57:19.605 --> 57:22.465
Just don’t think about it; it’s beyond
thinking.

57:22.465 --> 57:24.355
Thank you very much.

57:24.355 --> 57:25.355
Thank you.

57:25.355 --> 57:26.355
Beautiful!

57:26.355 --> 57:27.355
Oh, My!

57:27.355 --> 57:28.355
Thank you.

57:28.355 --> 57:30.211
It’s beautiful flowers.

57:42.939 --> 57:47.329
If you can push this apart, I’d like to
meet people.
