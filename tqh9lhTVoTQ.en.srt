1
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:10,114
Now, I think, we should have questions first.

2
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:15,274
What is Self-realization and how do You grant it?

3
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:32,131
Self-realization is the epitome of our
evolutionary process, which is a living process

4
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,207
through which you achieve your higher Self.

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,951
Even Darwin, who was an atheist,

6
00:00:40,951 --> 00:00:49,714
did say that as human beings have come
so far they will achieve their absolute.

7
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,616
So, to achieve your absolute
means to get Self-realization.

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,937
The purpose of our life, the meaning of our life

9
00:00:58,842 --> 00:01:07,234
is only achieved when we will get connected
with the Divine Power, which is all-pervading.

10
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:13,233
Now, one need not believe in the Divine
Power, but you can see the manifestation

11
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:19,767
of this living Divine Power when
you see a flower becoming a fruit.

12
00:01:19,889 --> 00:01:23,931
All living work is done by this Divine Power.

13
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,980
But we are not aware of it.

14
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,043
At this human stage we are not aware of it.

15
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,040
But once this happening takes
place in your awareness … it’s

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,420
not just suggesting that you become
something great or on … on mental level,

17
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:47,077
but actualization of this experience is felt in
your awareness, on your central nervous system.

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,581
You can feel that you have become
— again I say, you have become,

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,222
not told or brainwashed, but you
have become — collectively conscious.

20
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:06,194
Is a state where you can feel
your Self inside and others’ too.
