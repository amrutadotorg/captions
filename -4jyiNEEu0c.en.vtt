00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.857
Talk to Sahaja Yogis from Africa
Swiss Hotel, Istanbul, 23.04.2001

00:00:00.882 --> 00:00:03.436
This should not come  to you people because

00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:08.820
you live with the nature and nature is not,
nature is never corrupt.

00:00:18.994 --> 00:00:21.806
You know, every leaf, you will be amazed

00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:26.092
which is on the tree,
every leaf , gets the sunshine.

00:00:35.654 --> 00:00:39.106
Every leaf is different in the world, every leaf.

00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:42.006
And the way they organize it in such a manner,

00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:44.235
all of them get the Sun’s light.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.853
But in corruption, one wants to have all, everything.

00:01:00.308 --> 00:01:01.688
To have.

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:04.641
And then,

00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:09.860
he doesn’t know what is the joy in giving to others.

00:01:15.932 --> 00:01:18.622
You see, that’s how it happens with Sahaja Yoga that

00:01:18.647 --> 00:01:21.577
you become extremely generous.

00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:30.443
I’ll give the example of my husband

00:01:30.468 --> 00:01:32.821
or I should say of my father.

00:01:36.254 --> 00:01:39.813
He was a very, very generous man, very.

00:01:43.343 --> 00:01:46.755
And he told us not to lock the house.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.980
Keep it open, no thief will come.

00:01:54.394 --> 00:01:57.933
But one night a thief came and he took away

00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:00.429
this big gramophone which had this big horn,

00:02:00.434 --> 00:02:02.929
this thing  and he took it away.

00:02:14.837 --> 00:02:19.677
And  the second day,
my husband, my father was got upset.

00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:21.753
He was little bit  upset.

00:02:25.968 --> 00:02:29.547
So my mother said:
“Is it because of the gramophone?”,

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:33.234
“Is it because of the gramophone,
you are upset?”

00:02:41.081 --> 00:02:43.588
He said, “No, we can buy

00:02:43.613 --> 00:02:48.259
but what about this man,
he has taken  no records, what will  he use?”

00:03:00.998 --> 00:03:02.779
My mother said, “Alright.”

00:03:03.794 --> 00:03:08.169
And he said, “He should have brought
somebody else to take the gramophone.”

00:03:13.285 --> 00:03:14.531
So my mother said “Alright”,

00:03:14.556 --> 00:03:17.621
What you do is to advertise in the newspaper!

00:03:17.623 --> 00:03:21.847
The one who has stolen the gramophone
can also take away the records.”

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.972
That kind of generosity it is, that kind.

00:03:42.997 --> 00:03:47.056
He said, we can afford to buy both
but the poor man is a connoisseur of music,

00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:48.716
he should have records.

00:03:59.841 --> 00:04:02.476
Very generous, extremely generous.

00:04:05.747 --> 00:04:11.412
So, you see, the generosity is the only way
we can correct corruption.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.623
When you start enjoying giving, you don’t grab.

00:04:33.703 --> 00:04:39.871
And such a person has no reputation in the society

00:04:39.896 --> 00:04:43.296
and that money that he’s grabbed, is of no use.

00:04:50.823 --> 00:04:54.314
And all those people who have made money like that,

00:04:54.339 --> 00:05:00.441
have lost it because they’ve put in this Swiss Bank.

00:05:08.022 --> 00:05:12.723
And the Swiss bank also does not avail of it .

00:05:12.748 --> 00:05:15.615
They can do so much good but they don’t,

00:05:15.632 --> 00:05:19.024
they are keeping the money,
they are sitting on top.

00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:29.987
So one has to ….. if you  say anything,
talk about the Swiss bank.

00:05:30.012 --> 00:05:34.180
Stop the Swiss bank.
It’s cheating, complete cheating.

00:05:44.546 --> 00:05:47.013
I don’t know how they are legalized,

00:05:47.038 --> 00:05:51.190
they take money from the thieves and keep it there.

00:05:51.215 --> 00:05:52.895
How can they do that?

00:06:04.802 --> 00:06:08.755
If you stop the working of the Swiss bank,

00:06:08.787 --> 00:06:11.328
I’ll tell you, corruption will go away.

00:06:19.054 --> 00:06:23.506
That’s the only way you can stop
this high-class corruption.

00:06:32.724 --> 00:06:36.436
You should, you should write about it.

00:06:36.835 --> 00:06:39.113
Americans are very careful.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.677
If you send any money from America to Switzerland,

00:06:43.724 --> 00:06:46.994
Switzerland informs the authorities,
they aren’t negligent.

00:06:59.094 --> 00:07:01.847
There was in Brazil,  you see

00:07:01.872 --> 00:07:05.216
I met with the minister of law and also

00:07:07.494 --> 00:07:11.783
justice, chief justice, both of them I met.

00:07:19.502 --> 00:07:22.049
They were very respectful

00:07:22.074 --> 00:07:27.864
but they said that in our country we had a
prime minister who was impeached.

00:07:39.738 --> 00:07:41.174
impeached.

00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:45.374
And that fellow has now a very great job

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:50.901
in the University of whatever city is that …

00:07:51.542 --> 00:07:53.294
Switzerland.

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:55.916
No, no, no , in the America

00:07:55.941 --> 00:08:01.215
Harvard, Harvard University;
but  teaching Economics, can you imagine?

00:08:18.322 --> 00:08:20.957
He was impeached.

00:08:27.464 --> 00:08:31.614
So all these thieves will be going to
these kinds of universities,

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:34.448
and they will teach our children how to cheat.

00:08:42.714 --> 00:08:45.888
That’s what……it is coming.

00:08:48.451 --> 00:08:54.111
I spoke about it in China, where they had
this women’s conference so called.

00:09:01.994 --> 00:09:05.481
But I don’t know, this is a big game going on.

00:09:15.368 --> 00:09:19.351
And it’s a thing to be seen from Sahaja point-of-view.

00:09:28.365 --> 00:09:31.298
And it will all work out, I am sure, it will be better with it.

00:09:35.629 --> 00:09:39.446
Because it’s a global, global work.

00:09:42.529 --> 00:09:45.402
So, it cannot fail.

00:09:49.536 --> 00:09:52.136
It has the power of the collective.

00:09:58.086 --> 00:10:01.609
I wish we could have a conference one day,

00:10:01.634 --> 00:10:05.031
of all these people  in India or in a new country.

00:10:05.056 --> 00:10:06.523
Guido: Yes Shri Mataji

00:10:06.548 --> 00:10:11.139
You should go once and a new  big conference there.
