00:00.000 --> 00:00.857
Talk to Sahaja Yogis from Africa
Swiss Hotel, Istanbul, 23.04.2001

00:00.882 --> 00:03.436
This should not come  to you people because

00:03.461 --> 00:08.820
you live with the nature and nature is not,
nature is never corrupt.

00:18.994 --> 00:21.806
You know, every leaf, you will be amazed

00:21.831 --> 00:26.092
which is on the tree,
every leaf , gets the sunshine.

00:35.654 --> 00:39.106
Every leaf is different in the world, every leaf.

00:39.131 --> 00:42.006
And the way they organize it in such a manner,

00:42.038 --> 00:44.235
all of them get the Sun’s light.

00:49.630 --> 00:54.853
But in corruption, one wants to have all, everything.

01:00.308 --> 01:01.688
To have.

01:02.919 --> 01:04.641
And then,

01:05.151 --> 01:09.860
he doesn’t know what is the joy in giving to others.

01:15.932 --> 01:18.622
You see, that’s how it happens with Sahaja Yoga that

01:18.647 --> 01:21.577
you become extremely generous.

01:27.571 --> 01:30.443
I’ll give the example of my husband

01:30.468 --> 01:32.821
or I should say of my father.

01:36.254 --> 01:39.813
He was a very, very generous man, very.

01:43.343 --> 01:46.755
And he told us not to lock the house.

01:46.780 --> 01:48.980
Keep it open, no thief will come.

01:54.394 --> 01:57.933
But one night a thief came and he took away

01:57.958 --> 02:00.429
this big gramophone which had this big horn,

02:00.434 --> 02:02.929
this thing  and he took it away.

02:14.837 --> 02:19.677
And  the second day,
my husband, my father was got upset.

02:19.702 --> 02:21.753
He was little bit  upset.

02:25.968 --> 02:29.547
So my mother said:
“Is it because of the gramophone?”,

02:30.584 --> 02:33.234
“Is it because of the gramophone,
you are upset?”

02:41.081 --> 02:43.588
He said, “No, we can buy

02:43.613 --> 02:48.259
but what about this man,
he has taken  no records, what will  he use?”

03:00.998 --> 03:02.779
My mother said, “Alright.”

03:03.794 --> 03:08.169
And he said, “He should have brought
somebody else to take the gramophone.”

03:13.285 --> 03:14.531
So my mother said “Alright”,

03:14.556 --> 03:17.621
What you do is to advertise in the newspaper!

03:17.623 --> 03:21.847
The one who has stolen the gramophone
can also take away the records.”

03:40.409 --> 03:42.972
That kind of generosity it is, that kind.

03:42.997 --> 03:47.056
He said, we can afford to buy both
but the poor man is a connoisseur of music,

03:47.081 --> 03:48.716
he should have records.

03:59.841 --> 04:02.476
Very generous, extremely generous.

04:05.747 --> 04:11.412
So, you see, the generosity is the only way
we can correct corruption.

04:18.830 --> 04:23.623
When you start enjoying giving, you don’t grab.

04:33.703 --> 04:39.871
And such a person has no reputation in the society

04:39.896 --> 04:43.296
and that money that he’s grabbed, is of no use.

04:50.823 --> 04:54.314
And all those people who have made money like that,

04:54.339 --> 05:00.441
have lost it because they’ve put in this Swiss Bank.

05:08.022 --> 05:12.723
And the Swiss bank also does not avail of it .

05:12.748 --> 05:15.615
They can do so much good but they don’t,

05:15.632 --> 05:19.024
they are keeping the money,
they are sitting on top.

05:26.471 --> 05:29.987
So one has to ….. if you  say anything,
talk about the Swiss bank.

05:30.012 --> 05:34.180
Stop the Swiss bank.
It’s cheating, complete cheating.

05:44.546 --> 05:47.013
I don’t know how they are legalized,

05:47.038 --> 05:51.190
they take money from the thieves and keep it there.

05:51.215 --> 05:52.895
How can they do that?

06:04.802 --> 06:08.755
If you stop the working of the Swiss bank,

06:08.787 --> 06:11.328
I’ll tell you, corruption will go away.

06:19.054 --> 06:23.506
That’s the only way you can stop
this high-class corruption.

06:32.724 --> 06:36.436
You should, you should write about it.

06:36.835 --> 06:39.113
Americans are very careful.

06:39.220 --> 06:43.677
If you send any money from America to Switzerland,

06:43.724 --> 06:46.994
Switzerland informs the authorities,
they aren’t negligent.

06:59.094 --> 07:01.847
There was in Brazil,  you see

07:01.872 --> 07:05.216
I met with the minister of law and also

07:07.494 --> 07:11.783
justice, chief justice, both of them I met.

07:19.502 --> 07:22.049
They were very respectful

07:22.074 --> 07:27.864
but they said that in our country we had a
prime minister who was impeached.

07:39.738 --> 07:41.174
impeached.

07:41.753 --> 07:45.374
And that fellow has now a very great job

07:45.399 --> 07:50.901
in the University of whatever city is that …

07:51.542 --> 07:53.294
Switzerland.

07:53.319 --> 07:55.916
No, no, no , in the America

07:55.941 --> 08:01.215
Harvard, Harvard University;
but  teaching Economics, can you imagine?

08:18.322 --> 08:20.957
He was impeached.

08:27.464 --> 08:31.614
So all these thieves will be going to
these kinds of universities,

08:31.639 --> 08:34.448
and they will teach our children how to cheat.

08:42.714 --> 08:45.888
That’s what……it is coming.

08:48.451 --> 08:54.111
I spoke about it in China, where they had
this women’s conference so called.

09:01.994 --> 09:05.481
But I don’t know, this is a big game going on.

09:15.368 --> 09:19.351
And it’s a thing to be seen from Sahaja point-of-view.

09:28.365 --> 09:31.298
And it will all work out, I am sure, it will be better with it.

09:35.629 --> 09:39.446
Because it’s a global, global work.

09:42.529 --> 09:45.402
So, it cannot fail.

09:49.536 --> 09:52.136
It has the power of the collective.

09:58.086 --> 10:01.609
I wish we could have a conference one day,

10:01.634 --> 10:05.031
of all these people  in India or in a new country.

10:05.056 --> 10:06.523
Guido: Yes Shri Mataji

10:06.548 --> 10:11.139
You should go once and a new  big conference there.
