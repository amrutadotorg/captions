00:00:05.544 --> 00:00:13.594
Today's puja is very important for us.

00:00:13.594 --> 00:00:18.084
You all have got your Self Realization.

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:26.094
You have all the knowledge that is necessary
to give Realizations to others.

00:00:26.094 --> 00:00:31.954
You have to know what you have already.

00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:39.914
That's very important, because if you do not
try your hand and if you do not try to give

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:47.544
Realizations to others, firstly you'll have
no faith in yourself.

00:00:47.544 --> 00:00:53.244
You'll have no self-esteem also.

00:00:53.244 --> 00:01:04.134
The second part is that you try giving vibrations
to other persons, but don't get involved with

00:01:04.134 --> 00:01:06.634
that person.

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:10.554
I've seen some people get too much involved.

00:01:10.554 --> 00:01:15.224
If they give Realization to one person, they
think they have done a great job and they

00:01:15.224 --> 00:01:21.224
start working on that person, his family,
his relations, this thing.

00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:28.674
So, so far as you must have learned, that
one may be related, one may be closer to one

00:01:28.674 --> 00:01:43.994
person, but not necessarily he will have that
much of chance of Self Realization.

00:01:43.994 --> 00:01:46.424
Only way to grow is to be collective.

00:01:46.424 --> 00:01:49.343
There's no other way out.

00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:55.144
If people think that by staying away from
ashrams, alone living somewhere they will

00:01:55.144 --> 00:02:01.943
achieve much - that's not the way Sahaja Yoga
is meant.

00:02:01.943 --> 00:02:10.574
Formerly, people used to go to Himalayas and
most of them were separated and only one or

00:02:10.574 --> 00:02:15.024
two persons were chosen for spiritual growth.

00:02:15.024 --> 00:02:23.494
Here it is not question of spiritual growth,
it's a question of your collectivity growing

00:02:23.494 --> 00:02:25.834
in you.

00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:35.864
That is how you become a person who is collective,
who enjoys collective, who works on collective

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:38.384
and lives with collective.

00:02:38.384 --> 00:02:45.994
Such a person develops new kind of powers.

00:02:45.994 --> 00:03:00.283
And these powers are such that they are very
subtle, but they penetrate into any molecule,

00:03:00.283 --> 00:03:06.044
atom or human beings, anywhere.

00:03:06.044 --> 00:03:14.173
And their penetration is only possible if
you have a temperament which is collective.

00:03:14.173 --> 00:03:24.453
Without being fully collective, you cannot
achieve that height which is very necessary

00:03:24.453 --> 00:03:26.614
today for Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:26.614 --> 00:03:34.594
As you know, there are problems and problems
all over, as if you feel that the world is

00:03:34.594 --> 00:03:35.694
going to sink.

00:03:35.694 --> 00:03:42.484
Specially when I went to America I felt that
"My goodness, this is a hell that they have

00:03:42.484 --> 00:03:43.524
created here."

00:03:43.524 --> 00:03:50.624
Is just a hell because they have no dharma,
they don't believe in any dharma, completely

00:03:50.624 --> 00:03:58.143
they worship adharma and this kind of climate
is flowing all over.

00:03:58.143 --> 00:04:05.774
All over the world, you get reaction of American
adharmic life.

00:04:05.774 --> 00:04:09.033
And people think there's nothing wrong in
it.

00:04:09.033 --> 00:04:14.834
Whatever you may tell them, they will not
believe nor they will think that there's any

00:04:14.834 --> 00:04:15.834
verdict.

00:04:15.834 --> 00:04:23.283
But they don't see the destruction from the
very basis of their life, their families,

00:04:23.283 --> 00:04:25.674
their societies.

00:04:25.674 --> 00:04:36.283
The whole country, I feel, is filled with
such ugly type of adharmic nature, that one

00:04:36.283 --> 00:04:43.304
cannot even imagine how such ideas came into
their heads.

00:04:43.304 --> 00:04:47.294
And these ideas I need not tell you, you know
them very well.

00:04:47.294 --> 00:04:53.784
But if you have to save your children, you
have to be an ideal guru yourself.

00:04:53.784 --> 00:05:04.353
If you just talk of Sahaja Yoga and if you
try to assume that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:05:04.353 --> 00:05:10.924
also you try to propagate Sahaja Yoga without
all these powers being awakened in you, it

00:05:10.924 --> 00:05:12.873
would be a failure.

00:05:12.873 --> 00:05:23.614
So, how to develop these powers within us
we should see.

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:29.253
It's rather embarrassing for Me to tell you
how you have to behave towards your Guru.

00:05:29.253 --> 00:05:32.163
I think people have told you.

00:05:32.163 --> 00:05:39.024
But naturally, spontaneously, as soon as you
get your Realization and grow in it, naturally

00:05:39.024 --> 00:05:42.383
you develop a very humble attitude.

00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:56.903
Also an attitude through which you achieve
lots of

00:05:56.903 --> 00:05:59.184
qualities of your Guru.

00:05:59.184 --> 00:06:05.484
Now, supposing the Guru is at a particular
height and if you try to go on to the same

00:06:05.484 --> 00:06:10.093
height, nothing will move towards you.

00:06:10.093 --> 00:06:18.313
So you must sit at a place which is much lower
than the Guru's is.

00:06:18.313 --> 00:06:24.734
Some people take too much advantage of My
good nature, I should say, and so many people

00:06:24.734 --> 00:06:28.916
have pointed out to Me that "You must correct
these people, they talk to You at equal level

00:06:28.916 --> 00:06:29.916
and all that."

00:06:29.916 --> 00:06:34.373
I said: "They will learn a lesson, they will
learn a lesson."

00:06:34.373 --> 00:06:41.213
But sometimes, it doesn't work out and they
start talking on the same manner as if you

00:06:41.213 --> 00:06:46.054
are talking to your friend or to your equal.

00:06:46.054 --> 00:06:48.964
First is complete humility.

00:06:48.964 --> 00:06:51.023
You have to be a humble person, extremely
humble.

00:06:51.023 --> 00:07:02.413
Now, you check on that, when you talk to others,
are you humble?

00:07:02.413 --> 00:07:06.223
When you think of others, are you humble?

00:07:06.223 --> 00:07:12.603
When you look after your wife and children,
are you humble?

00:07:12.603 --> 00:07:24.864
That's a very important thing for every person
who thinks he is a Guru.

00:07:24.864 --> 00:07:32.163
Humility is the first quality or, I should
say, the ocean into which you must jump.

00:07:32.163 --> 00:07:37.663
Some people think that "If you are humble,
Mother, then people will take advantage of

00:07:37.663 --> 00:07:39.584
you."

00:07:39.584 --> 00:07:45.303
Nobody can take advantage of you, because
you have to remember another point, that you

00:07:45.303 --> 00:07:51.443
are protected all the time, looked after by
Param Chaitanya.

00:07:51.443 --> 00:07:59.183
I know you know that, but how many really
believe that there is Param Chaitanya with

00:07:59.183 --> 00:08:00.183
us?

00:08:00.183 --> 00:08:09.033
If you really believe that there is Param
Chaitanya, then you don't get frightened,

00:08:09.033 --> 00:08:16.403
you don't get worried, you are not subjected
to all kinds of nonsensical ideas also.

00:08:16.403 --> 00:08:22.113
But if you think that you are not protected,
"What will happen?

00:08:22.113 --> 00:08:29.023
How will things happen?" then Param Chaitanya
leaves you alone.

00:08:29.023 --> 00:08:43.474
You have to see the whole drama, how Param
Chaitanya works out, how It works out, how

00:08:43.474 --> 00:08:44.474
you are behaving.

00:08:44.474 --> 00:08:57.044
Supposing you are not in a proper shape and
you try to show off too much, then what happens?

00:08:57.044 --> 00:09:00.844
Then, you get the reward for it.

00:09:00.844 --> 00:09:06.294
Not that I do anything, but it is the Param
Chaitanya which will teach you a lesson that

00:09:06.294 --> 00:09:11.573
you will remember, that you should have been
little different from what you have been.

00:09:11.573 --> 00:09:17.333
After all, we have to know why have we come
to Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:19.573
Begin at the root of it.

00:09:19.573 --> 00:09:27.114
We have come to Sahaja Yoga because we wanted
to know the absolute truth, and this absolute

00:09:27.114 --> 00:09:32.963
truth has been now known to you through your
vibrations.

00:09:32.963 --> 00:09:41.393
You know it through your vibrations, what
is the absolute truth, and you should work

00:09:41.393 --> 00:09:53.453
everything on that line, that absolute truth,
whatever you feel on your vibrations you have

00:09:53.453 --> 00:09:54.744
to follow.

00:09:54.744 --> 00:10:00.724
Unfortunately, I have seen many people think
that their vibrations are all right, they

00:10:00.724 --> 00:10:05.104
are all right and whatever they are receiving
on their vibrations is first class.

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:09.494
Now, how to correct that point is very difficult.

00:10:09.494 --> 00:10:11.044
It comes from ego.

00:10:11.044 --> 00:10:15.904
When you have ego, you can never find anything
wrong with you.

00:10:15.904 --> 00:10:20.354
And even if the vibrations are telling you
something, it might be somebody else who is

00:10:20.354 --> 00:10:27.203
telling you something, because you are not
there, your ego is there and your ego is just

00:10:27.203 --> 00:10:35.854
spoiling you and teaching you things which
normally you would see clearly that "I'm doing

00:10:35.854 --> 00:10:39.034
something wrong, I should not have done it."

00:10:39.034 --> 00:10:49.623
In this process of correction and improvement,
when you indulge you should see: "Are you

00:10:49.623 --> 00:10:52.003
getting subtler or grosser?"

00:10:52.003 --> 00:10:53.734
That is the best way to judge.

00:10:53.734 --> 00:11:05.203
Now, I've seen people who go on judging on
small things like vibrations - whether this

00:11:05.203 --> 00:11:12.474
vibration are all right or not in this tree
or on this flowers or on this land, all kinds

00:11:12.474 --> 00:11:15.244
of material things they want to see the vibrations.

00:11:15.244 --> 00:11:18.114
But for what are you seeing the vibration?

00:11:18.114 --> 00:11:25.544
You are seeing vibration because some sort
of material gain.

00:11:25.544 --> 00:11:30.383
You think that if you check the vibrations
and the vibrations are all right, then you

00:11:30.383 --> 00:11:36.123
are quite safe, you will not loose this, will
not loose that.

00:11:36.123 --> 00:11:38.214
It's not true.

00:11:38.214 --> 00:11:44.763
Because vibrations are not meant to judge
all these worldly things and worldly matters.

00:11:44.763 --> 00:11:48.914
It's absolutely cheapening the vibrations.

00:11:48.914 --> 00:11:56.534
You should not cheapen them, because vibrations
can suggest things which may be detrimental

00:11:56.534 --> 00:11:59.374
to your growth very much.

00:11:59.374 --> 00:12:05.364
Once, I wanted somebody to go somewhere, so
he said, "I didn't go, Mother."

00:12:05.364 --> 00:12:06.364
I said, "Why?"

00:12:06.364 --> 00:12:08.804
"Because I saw the vibrations were very bad."

00:12:08.804 --> 00:12:11.813
I said, "That's why I asked you to go.

00:12:11.813 --> 00:12:19.364
If the vibrations were good, what was your
use going there?

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:24.664
That's the reason I asked you to go there
so that you could help but before that you

00:12:24.664 --> 00:12:29.174
judged yourself, judged your vibrations and
then you didn't want to go."

00:12:29.174 --> 00:12:34.313
So, what happens, we want to have a easy,
cozy life.

00:12:34.313 --> 00:12:40.914
And all our problems must be solved by Sahaja
Yoga, otherwise we think Sahaja Yoga is of

00:12:40.914 --> 00:12:41.914
no use.

00:12:41.914 --> 00:12:45.544
Whatever is our desire must be fulfilled.

00:12:45.544 --> 00:12:48.804
So, now the desires are mostly personal.

00:12:48.804 --> 00:12:55.474
"My child is not well, so the child should
be all right, my husband is misbehaving, the

00:12:55.474 --> 00:13:01.433
husband should be all right" or "I have no
house, I must get a house."

00:13:01.433 --> 00:13:08.974
See how we are moving our mind, is still on
a very consumer society, as they call it.

00:13:08.974 --> 00:13:16.844
We are all the time thinking, "Now I should
have a son, now, instead of a girl" and you

00:13:16.844 --> 00:13:21.693
get a son and then you blame Sahaja Yoga for
that!

00:13:21.693 --> 00:13:28.094
Anything that according to your desire doesn't
work out, then you think it's Sahaja Yoga

00:13:28.094 --> 00:13:29.833
which has done the harm and you are suffering
because of Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:29.833 --> 00:13:41.364
Or this faith in Sahaja Yoga gets little moving
or we can say, in a way, it's not that deep.

00:13:41.364 --> 00:13:50.463
But if you are deeply imbedded in Sahaja Yoga,
then what happens?

00:13:50.463 --> 00:13:57.794
"What may come, I will be a Sahaja Yogi."

00:13:57.794 --> 00:14:04.284
Supposing somebody dies, normally in Sahaja
Yoga it's difficult for people to die also,

00:14:04.284 --> 00:14:05.754
I must tell you.

00:14:05.754 --> 00:14:09.784
Even if they want to die, they can't die.

00:14:09.784 --> 00:14:12.703
It's the Param Chaitanya which decides for
you.

00:14:12.703 --> 00:14:19.974
But supposing you take up a position like
that, still you must know that that wish may

00:14:19.974 --> 00:14:20.974
not be fulfilled.

00:14:20.974 --> 00:14:33.364
If that is not fulfilled then you feel disturbed
and you think, "What's wrong?"

00:14:33.364 --> 00:14:50.883
But your wish is not the wish of God Almighty,
while Param Chaitanya is the wish of God Almighty.

00:14:50.883 --> 00:14:54.474
Now for example I went to America, take it
like this, and America attacked Me.

00:14:54.474 --> 00:14:58.143
Negativity and troubled Me.

00:14:58.143 --> 00:15:07.734
For all these days I'm suffering so-called,
and I have had pain, I have had all kinds

00:15:07.734 --> 00:15:08.734
of things.

00:15:08.734 --> 00:15:15.333
But that I had to do because now the American
Sahaja Yogis will realize how much one has

00:15:15.333 --> 00:15:23.643
to pay to make this dumb head of Americans
to rise.

00:15:23.643 --> 00:15:34.203
How stupid they are and how foolish they are
who are enamored by people who are taking

00:15:34.203 --> 00:15:36.263
money!

00:15:36.263 --> 00:15:43.963
So many people came to Me and told Me, "Mother,
if You start saying that, this I can give

00:15:43.963 --> 00:15:51.013
for 300 dollars, You'll get thousands and
thousands of disciples of Yours."

00:15:51.013 --> 00:15:55.164
I said, "They'll not be My disciples.

00:15:55.164 --> 00:16:00.484
If they come for money, thinking that because
I'm taking money it is worthy something, that

00:16:00.484 --> 00:16:04.434
means they are absolutely stupid!"

00:16:04.434 --> 00:16:10.684
Sahaja Yoga, you cannot get it by money, this
is the first principle they don't understand,

00:16:10.684 --> 00:16:12.054
most of them!

00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:21.213
Most of them don't understand that you can
get Self Realization without paying any money.

00:16:21.213 --> 00:16:30.694
They were some Gujarati rich people in New
Jersey and they asked questions to Sahaja

00:16:30.694 --> 00:16:34.124
Yogis that "How is it possible to get it so
easily?

00:16:34.124 --> 00:16:40.104
It's not possible because it's a very difficult
thing, all the shastras have said, everybody

00:16:40.104 --> 00:16:43.654
has said, it's very difficult to get your
Realization.

00:16:43.654 --> 00:16:44.654
All right!

00:16:44.654 --> 00:16:49.664
If so, how is it you are giving it so easily?

00:16:49.664 --> 00:16:51.564
Why?"

00:16:51.564 --> 00:16:54.354
Nobody knew how to answer to these people.

00:16:54.354 --> 00:17:00.554
You should have said like this, "All right
it is difficult, very difficult and you cannot

00:17:00.554 --> 00:17:02.133
give mass, true!

00:17:02.133 --> 00:17:08.133
But if somebody is doing it, then you have
to think about it, how somebody is doing it?"

00:17:08.133 --> 00:17:13.794
So, this kind of stupid questions are there
and still if they go on, you have really to

00:17:13.794 --> 00:17:19.993
tell them in a very humble way: "Sir, one
has to be worthy also."

00:17:19.993 --> 00:17:25.924
So, they will run after people who are just
making money out of them, making fool out

00:17:25.924 --> 00:17:26.924
of them.

00:17:26.924 --> 00:17:28.474
And they boast, "We have three gurus."

00:17:28.474 --> 00:17:31.064
Somebody says, "We have seven gurus!"

00:17:31.064 --> 00:17:35.214
And I wonder what must be their condition.

00:17:35.214 --> 00:17:40.314
So the people who are extremely stupid, in
Sanskrit they call "[SOUNDS LIKE MURLE OR

00:17:40.314 --> 00:17:48.243
MOOHL]" people who are brainless cannot get
their Realization, so give them up.

00:17:48.243 --> 00:17:54.824
If they are arguing with you, you just give
them up.

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:57.524
It's not their right to argue with you.

00:17:57.524 --> 00:18:04.304
Their right is to get Realization but not
a right to argue with you, ask you foolish

00:18:04.304 --> 00:18:06.613
questions and stupid questions.

00:18:06.613 --> 00:18:11.593
But you should always remember that with that
humility you must have your dignity intact

00:18:11.593 --> 00:18:12.964
because you are a Guru.

00:18:12.964 --> 00:18:22.604
Once you know you are a Guru, one thing should
be there that you will not behave like a joker

00:18:22.604 --> 00:18:23.904
all the time.

00:18:23.904 --> 00:18:26.863
Your behavior will be dignified.

00:18:26.863 --> 00:18:34.704
At the same time, it will be very pleasant
face or a pleasant personality.

00:18:34.704 --> 00:18:36.224
It won't be annoying type.

00:18:36.224 --> 00:18:41.024
Your personality itself will suggest that
there's something special about you.

00:18:41.024 --> 00:18:54.124
Now, how do you develop that kind of a personality?

00:18:54.124 --> 00:19:01.514
The biggest problem in the West is ego and
the biggest problem in the East is superego.

00:19:01.514 --> 00:19:08.014
Now, this ego business, I don't know from
where it has come.

00:19:08.014 --> 00:19:12.213
In all walk of life, they show how egoistical
they are.

00:19:12.213 --> 00:19:20.134
For example, I went to America and I was surprised
that there is a racial problem, and the blacks

00:19:20.134 --> 00:19:22.654
are treated in a different manner, and the
whites in a different manner.

00:19:22.654 --> 00:19:29.574
I mean, color is given by God and somebody
has to be black, and white.

00:19:29.574 --> 00:19:33.054
If everybody looked the same, it will look
like a regiment.

00:19:33.054 --> 00:19:42.464
There should be some variety, there should
be some change in the face and also in the

00:19:42.464 --> 00:19:43.464
expression.

00:19:43.464 --> 00:19:55.124
One has to be a person carrying better or
different expressions, otherwise you will

00:19:55.124 --> 00:20:00.154
be bored with such a world where there is
everybody looks the same, just the same.

00:20:00.154 --> 00:20:08.733
But so much of racialism there that I was
surprised that how it has worked into human

00:20:08.733 --> 00:20:09.733
mind.

00:20:09.733 --> 00:20:17.844
So, as a Guru, you must develop a complete
detest for racialism, complete detest.

00:20:17.844 --> 00:20:26.874
That's very easy to understand that anybody
who has fair complexion could be a cruelest

00:20:26.874 --> 00:20:32.723
man, cruelest woman and could be a cruelest
mother also.

00:20:32.723 --> 00:20:38.134
And the one who is black could be very kind,
generous.

00:20:38.134 --> 00:20:44.144
It doesn't go with the color, temperament
doesn't go with the color.

00:20:44.144 --> 00:20:49.554
But because the blacks have been ill-treated
so much that they react.

00:20:49.554 --> 00:20:57.694
And they react, naturally, in sometimes in
such a manner that it is very crude and very

00:20:57.694 --> 00:20:58.694
cruel.

00:20:58.694 --> 00:21:11.613
But this kind of attention, this kind of a,
you can say, a wrong type of attitude towards

00:21:11.613 --> 00:21:15.953
human beings, even towards animals they won't
bear it.

00:21:15.953 --> 00:21:22.764
So towards human beings to have such an attitude
itself shows that you are not worthy of Sahaja

00:21:22.764 --> 00:21:24.574
Yoga at all.

00:21:24.574 --> 00:21:35.744
So anyone of you who has such a feeling that
somebody is black and somebody is white cannot

00:21:35.744 --> 00:21:41.404
be a guru in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:41.404 --> 00:21:46.684
Then in India we have caste system, equally
bad and horrible.

00:21:46.684 --> 00:21:54.863
It has no sense in it, no basis whatsoever,
but in India we have people who believe that

00:21:54.863 --> 00:21:58.603
some castes are higher and some castes are
lower.

00:21:58.603 --> 00:22:06.195
Every caste people can do all the worst possible
things, there is no demarcation for them and

00:22:06.195 --> 00:22:11.113
every low caste can be very, very good.

00:22:11.113 --> 00:22:18.733
We have had many great poets and Sufis in
the lowest castes in India.

00:22:18.733 --> 00:22:21.074
This castes are man-made.

00:22:21.074 --> 00:22:27.374
You know man-made cloth doesn't suit us, and
all these man-made ideas are not going to

00:22:27.374 --> 00:22:36.223
suit us and it will lead us into a great - I
wouldn't know discretion - but I would say

00:22:36.223 --> 00:22:47.493
to a complete destruction, because hatred
begets hatred and it goes on increasing and

00:22:47.493 --> 00:22:48.493
increasing.

00:22:48.493 --> 00:22:54.444
If you cannot get rid of your hatred, then,
I would say you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:22:54.444 --> 00:22:56.884
These are all conditionings.

00:22:56.884 --> 00:23:07.483
You were born in a white family, so you are
white, you were born in a Christian family

00:23:07.483 --> 00:23:12.985
that's why you are Christian, you were born
in a Jew family, that's why you are a Jew.

00:23:12.985 --> 00:23:14.154
All this is just because you were born in
that.

00:23:14.154 --> 00:23:19.963
But does that mean that you are higher or
lower?

00:23:19.963 --> 00:23:26.963
All the problems of the world today, if you
see, are because of human attachment to nonsensical

00:23:26.963 --> 00:23:29.474
ideas of superiority.

00:23:29.474 --> 00:23:35.694
Only through collective living will change.

00:23:35.694 --> 00:23:44.814
For example, I would say, in an ashram, we
should have all colored people living together

00:23:44.814 --> 00:23:52.213
with the equal rights, with the equal understanding
and love and affection.

00:23:52.213 --> 00:24:06.203
If that is not there, no use calling it an
ashram.

00:24:06.203 --> 00:24:13.274
Once, they asked Me, "Mother, will You come
and give a lecture in Harlem?"

00:24:13.274 --> 00:24:14.814
I said, "Why not?"

00:24:14.814 --> 00:24:16.613
So some Sahaja Yogis said, "Harlem?

00:24:16.613 --> 00:24:18.963
Mother, do You know what is Harlem?"

00:24:18.963 --> 00:24:20.083
I said, "I know.

00:24:20.083 --> 00:24:21.083
There's no harm."

00:24:21.083 --> 00:24:24.314
They said, "You know the blacks are there
and..."

00:24:24.314 --> 00:24:26.984
I said, "I'm also black."

00:24:26.984 --> 00:24:36.304
You could call Me black or you can call Me
white, but the love is such a thing, you see,

00:24:36.304 --> 00:24:43.124
love is such a thing that cleanses all these
ridiculous ideas we have about other people.

00:24:43.124 --> 00:24:50.484
To brand anyone as black and white shows that
you have no eyes to see.

00:24:50.484 --> 00:25:03.363
Any person with depth, any person with loving
heart cannot see these superficial things,

00:25:03.363 --> 00:25:05.664
cannot see!

00:25:05.664 --> 00:25:11.733
Today is a day where we are celebrating the
Guru's greatness.

00:25:11.733 --> 00:25:23.154
Now, look at all the Gurus, how they were,
how they behaved.

00:25:23.154 --> 00:25:29.144
We have many in India and many others many
Sufis in other countries.

00:25:29.144 --> 00:25:38.384
These Sufis or these saints that we had never
believed in any caste system, never believed

00:25:38.384 --> 00:25:40.254
in black and white.

00:25:40.254 --> 00:25:44.304
Christ, He never believed in black and white.

00:25:44.304 --> 00:25:49.254
Buddha never believed in black and white.

00:25:49.254 --> 00:25:57.544
Nobody believed in any kind of man-made ideas.

00:25:57.544 --> 00:26:06.863
These are all man-made ideas which we have
accepted and, even after Realization, we

00:26:06.863 --> 00:26:10.894
try to carry on with them.

00:26:10.894 --> 00:26:17.924
Now, by saying, we do not get rid of it, but
acting we can.

00:26:17.924 --> 00:26:29.343
Just see how we work out these stupid ideas
within us and how we can get rid of them.

00:26:29.343 --> 00:26:39.874
Very simple is in meditation you should sit
down and see how many people you love and

00:26:39.874 --> 00:26:50.304
why do you love, not out of pity, but just
with love, how much you care for others.

00:26:50.304 --> 00:26:57.064
I've seen some very beautiful examples of
that, but still I must say that there are

00:26:57.064 --> 00:27:04.834
certain fixed ideas which are to be dislodged
completely, very important for every person

00:27:04.834 --> 00:27:08.584
who is a Guru in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:08.584 --> 00:27:13.124
Means he has to be a clean-hearted, open-hearted,
loving-hearted fellow.

00:27:13.124 --> 00:27:18.014
His heart should play the tune of Param Chaitanya.

00:27:18.014 --> 00:27:26.784
If his heart is full of all these man-made
ideas, I don't know what will happen.

00:27:26.784 --> 00:27:34.014
Even when they transplant the heart, they
cannot do it with a man-made, they have to

00:27:34.014 --> 00:27:36.034
use a real, natural one.

00:27:36.034 --> 00:27:48.333
So you can imagine when you try to take to
all these odd ideas, are just divisive, they

00:27:48.333 --> 00:27:51.954
will never give you collectivity.

00:27:51.954 --> 00:27:54.684
So, introspection has to be made.

00:27:54.684 --> 00:28:03.684
Are we one, or we are judging each other?

00:28:03.684 --> 00:28:10.584
Now, the judgment is quite a lot also.

00:28:10.584 --> 00:28:21.474
Now, all this can be seen only when you live
together, otherwise how will you know?

00:28:21.474 --> 00:28:30.514
When you start living together, you discover,
start discovering what is missing in you,

00:28:30.514 --> 00:28:33.863
what is not there, what has to be there.

00:28:33.863 --> 00:28:43.704
It is so peaceful to have a heart which is
full of love because every movement of that

00:28:43.704 --> 00:28:50.924
heart is so much joy giving, so much joy giving.

00:28:50.924 --> 00:29:04.034
There's a story of Shri Rama, that He ate
the bers, a kind of fruit, which were first

00:29:04.034 --> 00:29:08.444
tasted by an old lady with such love.

00:29:08.444 --> 00:29:09.564
Shows what?

00:29:09.564 --> 00:29:18.664
Shows that a person like Shri Ram Who was
the King of the highest heritage and this

00:29:18.664 --> 00:29:27.475
old lady who was just of the lowest caste
gives Him these fruits with such love, and

00:29:27.475 --> 00:29:31.124
when He eats that, He starts praising it.

00:29:31.124 --> 00:29:33.684
So His wife says, "Give me some!"

00:29:33.684 --> 00:29:40.264
He says, "All right," but the brother is still
half way, I think, in Sahaja Yoga, so he doesn't

00:29:40.264 --> 00:29:43.843
like, he doesn't like, he gets angry.

00:29:43.843 --> 00:29:45.573
Then She eats and She says, "Brother-in-law,
it's wonderful fruit, I must say!"

00:29:45.573 --> 00:29:48.203
He says, "All right, give me some."

00:29:48.203 --> 00:29:51.743
She says, "Why should I give you now?

00:29:51.743 --> 00:29:59.254
First you were a very much angry, so why should
I give you these fruits to eat?"

00:29:59.254 --> 00:30:10.904
The story shows that the level of your personality
as Guru is judged by your clean heart, by

00:30:10.904 --> 00:30:20.664
your loving heart, by your highest, remarkable
personality.

00:30:20.664 --> 00:30:26.203
In the personality it is not something that
is to be built-in artificially.

00:30:26.203 --> 00:30:33.043
It is not artificial; it is natural, absolutely
natural.

00:30:33.043 --> 00:30:37.963
Whatever you do has to be natural.

00:30:37.963 --> 00:30:46.904
So, this artificiality of certain ways of
talking or certain ways of living together

00:30:46.904 --> 00:30:48.254
creates problem.

00:30:48.254 --> 00:30:56.983
For example, we had a ashram in America, in
New York, and there was a lady who was very

00:30:56.983 --> 00:31:04.193
strict, everything should be tip-top, it should
be here, the spoons must be there and the

00:31:04.193 --> 00:31:08.794
forks should be here, and all sort of things
and she hurt many people.

00:31:08.794 --> 00:31:09.794
Not important.

00:31:09.794 --> 00:31:19.384
These cultural, what you can call it, the
taboos are not important in Sahaja Yoga, because

00:31:19.384 --> 00:31:22.233
now, you have become a Guru.

00:31:22.233 --> 00:31:27.733
Guru can stay anywhere, live anywhere, eat
anything, any time.

00:31:27.733 --> 00:31:29.274
That should be the case.

00:31:29.274 --> 00:31:37.904
But also I've seen in Sahaja Yoga, there are
many who are very anxious to eat food as soon

00:31:37.904 --> 00:31:39.274
as it is served.

00:31:39.274 --> 00:31:44.483
Once it happened, I was there, they had served
the food and just they started removing the

00:31:44.483 --> 00:31:45.483
plates.

00:31:45.483 --> 00:31:46.603
I said, "What's the matter, I have to eat."

00:31:46.603 --> 00:31:47.603
"Oh!

00:31:47.603 --> 00:31:48.603
You haven't eaten, Mother?"

00:31:48.603 --> 00:31:50.983
"No, I haven't yet touched it even."

00:31:50.983 --> 00:32:01.093
So, you see, sort of, first it is the very
lowest type of, we should say, desire, is

00:32:01.093 --> 00:32:02.093
the hunger.

00:32:02.093 --> 00:32:04.894
Now, a Guru doesn't bother.

00:32:04.894 --> 00:32:09.954
Whatever you give, all right, whatever he
wants not to give, all right.

00:32:09.954 --> 00:32:17.784
Even if you don't give is all right, but one
has to develop that by killing your ego.

00:32:17.784 --> 00:32:25.154
People feel very hurt if you serve them little
later than another person.

00:32:25.154 --> 00:32:29.934
It's all kinds of funny things I've seen in
Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:29.934 --> 00:32:37.213
On the contrary it is the lowest type of,
I should say, a desire.

00:32:37.213 --> 00:32:44.124
You should not be very much catered to, if
you want to be a real Guru.

00:32:44.124 --> 00:32:53.953
Of course, many problems are solved, as I
have seen so far that they do not take to

00:32:53.953 --> 00:33:01.514
drugs, they do not take to drinking and all
such things.

00:33:01.514 --> 00:33:06.164
You see, it's such a blessing, because if
I had to start from that level, I don't know

00:33:06.164 --> 00:33:10.164
how deep I would have gone, from where I would
have pulled you out.

00:33:10.164 --> 00:33:13.774
But that is of course a very big thing.

00:33:13.774 --> 00:33:20.674
That is quite a nice thing but still, to make
a beautiful life out of it which will attract

00:33:20.674 --> 00:33:27.243
the attention of everyone - how you talk,
how you behave, how you love.

00:33:27.243 --> 00:33:38.294
So, again one has to say that Guru Pada comes
only through the love that you have.

00:33:38.294 --> 00:33:48.743
Like they'll have, say, ten people for anything,
for a drama supposing, and they have it only

00:33:48.743 --> 00:33:58.103
from a particular country or from a particular
group, then there's no fun!

00:33:58.103 --> 00:34:00.084
There's no fun.

00:34:00.084 --> 00:34:05.794
For example they'll have a music group, so,
from the particular one caste could be or

00:34:05.794 --> 00:34:15.504
could be one religion, could be one, you can
say, one school or anything.

00:34:15.504 --> 00:34:19.914
So that shows that you are still not there.

00:34:19.914 --> 00:34:32.564
As a Guru, you should like every kind of culture,
every kind of beauty and that has to be brought

00:34:32.564 --> 00:34:36.474
in, in our daily life.

00:34:36.474 --> 00:34:46.854
You should not look down upon anyone for their
color, for their race, for their status, class

00:34:46.854 --> 00:34:47.884
consciousness.

00:34:47.884 --> 00:34:56.444
All this has been shown in the lives of all
these Guru saints who lived.

00:34:56.444 --> 00:35:02.804
Tukarama says, "Oh God, thank God you have
made me a Shidhul caste."

00:35:02.804 --> 00:35:09.384
He was not but he just says so.

00:35:09.384 --> 00:35:19.874
All of us, all the time should not be conscious
of what has been our birth, what has been

00:35:19.874 --> 00:35:26.994
our personality or what has been our beginning.

00:35:26.994 --> 00:35:34.994
One should not be able to make out even who
is the saint and who is not.

00:35:34.994 --> 00:35:40.444
Even people are proud that they are saints.

00:35:40.444 --> 00:35:47.404
I was surprised in America, also, very much
that the Russians who have gone there are

00:35:47.404 --> 00:35:49.154
a very different quality people.

00:35:49.154 --> 00:35:55.714
They wouldn't raise their eyes to Me, wouldn't
raise their eyes and very deep, very, very

00:35:55.714 --> 00:35:56.714
deep.

00:35:56.714 --> 00:35:58.354
Vibrations were very deep.

00:35:58.354 --> 00:36:06.704
The reason is, I think, they have been oppressed
during communism, perhaps, maybe, and now

00:36:06.704 --> 00:36:13.654
they have come to America where they have
seen so-called freedom and what nonsense it

00:36:13.654 --> 00:36:16.544
is doing.

00:36:16.544 --> 00:36:25.684
So knowing these two extremes, I think they
have gone very deep into their own being,

00:36:25.684 --> 00:36:34.474
and they have such strength and such unity
among themselves.

00:36:34.474 --> 00:36:41.134
I was surprised that I had never met them
before.

00:36:41.134 --> 00:36:47.344
They didn't come from Russia, they came, only
they were there.

00:36:47.344 --> 00:36:59.324
So, what is it that has kept them like that
is, that they had no religion in their heads.

00:36:59.324 --> 00:37:00.704
They had no religion.

00:37:00.704 --> 00:37:07.644
To them, every religion is the same and they
had no religion to follow.

00:37:07.644 --> 00:37:17.384
So, a Guru cannot belong to any religion because
these religions are also man-made.

00:37:17.384 --> 00:37:22.194
They have created such a problem all over
and they are all fighting among themselves,

00:37:22.194 --> 00:37:24.454
how can they be divine?

00:37:24.454 --> 00:37:35.894
So, you should not get involved into some
sort of a religious bias.

00:37:35.894 --> 00:37:45.944
I've seen it, that a Sahaja Yogi, say if he
is a Christian, then the bias will be shown

00:37:45.944 --> 00:37:46.944
that he is a Christian, you can make it out.

00:37:46.944 --> 00:37:50.684
If he is a Jew, you can make it out.

00:37:50.684 --> 00:37:57.064
So what's the use of coming to Sahaja Yoga?

00:37:57.064 --> 00:38:05.824
Their attention, if it goes inside they'll
find out.

00:38:05.824 --> 00:38:12.934
You have to dissect yourself to see what's
wrong with you and why is it that you are

00:38:12.934 --> 00:38:20.124
not very successful as a Guru.

00:38:20.124 --> 00:38:30.764
The success of the Guru is: he doesn't bother
about time.

00:38:30.764 --> 00:38:34.354
Every time is the holy time.

00:38:34.354 --> 00:38:39.874
For he's not bothered if somebody is late
or has come early.

00:38:39.874 --> 00:38:43.454
He is not a slave of watches and time.

00:38:43.454 --> 00:38:45.934
This is also man-made.

00:38:45.934 --> 00:38:54.104
There were no watches about, I think, three
hundred years back and nobody was so particular

00:38:54.104 --> 00:38:55.594
about the timing.

00:38:55.594 --> 00:39:02.784
So, first thing, he is beyond time, kalatit
as they call it.

00:39:02.784 --> 00:39:05.884
Then he is also gunatit.

00:39:05.884 --> 00:39:13.784
Gunatit means he doesn't belong to the left
side or to the right side or to the center.

00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:23.954
He is beyond these three, beyond these gunas
where he stands and sees everything in the

00:39:23.954 --> 00:39:26.574
Divine Light.

00:39:26.574 --> 00:39:28.454
Everything!

00:39:28.454 --> 00:39:32.564
If something good happens to him, he said,
"The Divine Light has done."

00:39:32.564 --> 00:39:37.774
If something bad happens to him, he said,
"The Divine light wanted this way."

00:39:37.774 --> 00:39:40.354
Everything he leaves for the Divine Light.

00:39:40.354 --> 00:39:42.724
He is beyond the gunas.

00:39:42.724 --> 00:39:49.524
Like, supposing there is a person who is on
the right side - egoistical - then he'll start

00:39:49.524 --> 00:39:51.874
saying, "How is it?

00:39:51.874 --> 00:39:56.414
I wanted this, this didn't work out and how...,"
he'll challenge.

00:39:56.414 --> 00:40:02.114
Another will start crying, the left sided
one that "I'm very sorry this has happened

00:40:02.114 --> 00:40:06.044
to me, it should not have happened" and all
that.

00:40:06.044 --> 00:40:13.474
In the center also, he might think that "How
far are my vibrations, how could I not know?"

00:40:13.474 --> 00:40:14.984
and all that.

00:40:14.984 --> 00:40:24.104
But a person who is a real Guru, he looks
at it as a drama, as a, just a witness of

00:40:24.104 --> 00:40:25.104
the drama.

00:40:25.104 --> 00:40:29.254
"It happened, it was to happen, so it has
happened."

00:40:29.254 --> 00:40:32.054
So, what do we get out of it?

00:40:32.054 --> 00:40:39.294
You see we get something: the lesson that
this was not right or this was wrong, that's

00:40:39.294 --> 00:40:40.294
all.

00:40:40.294 --> 00:40:46.724
For that moment, not to go on churning in
your head, that's all one gets and he is not

00:40:46.724 --> 00:40:48.554
bothered about anything else.

00:40:48.554 --> 00:40:57.714
So he goes beyond his gunas, beyond gunas
he lives, he eats anywhere, sleeps anywhere,

00:40:57.714 --> 00:41:04.854
he is not bothered where he lives, he is not
bothered whether he goes by car or he goes

00:41:04.854 --> 00:41:13.484
by bullock cart, he doesn't feel he is being
not honored if they give him a garland of

00:41:13.484 --> 00:41:16.794
few flowers.

00:41:16.794 --> 00:41:19.464
It's not that.

00:41:19.464 --> 00:41:27.954
He is not bothered, because nothing can enhance
his personality - nothing!

00:41:27.954 --> 00:41:37.504
You give them something simple it's all right,
or even if you don't give, it's all right.

00:41:37.504 --> 00:41:43.604
It's not he judges himself through your eyes,
but he judges himself through his own eyes

00:41:43.604 --> 00:41:49.884
and he sees for himself the joy of enjoying
himself.

00:41:49.884 --> 00:41:57.244
What is there to be so particular about anything?

00:41:57.244 --> 00:42:03.434
What is so great to be hankering after anything?

00:42:03.434 --> 00:42:10.514
It just works out in its own time and if it
doesn't, it doesn't.

00:42:10.514 --> 00:42:11.974
What does it matter?

00:42:11.974 --> 00:42:14.064
Just think of it!

00:42:14.064 --> 00:42:21.434
Also, in Sahaja Yoga, a Guru has to be a binding
force.

00:42:21.434 --> 00:42:32.364
There are two types of people, I've seen,
which go on breaking relations.

00:42:32.364 --> 00:42:35.514
It's very easy for them.

00:42:35.514 --> 00:42:38.364
They go on complaining.

00:42:38.364 --> 00:42:48.054
But there are others who have a power to bind
people together in such a manner, in such

00:42:48.054 --> 00:42:56.074
a sweet manner that the people are brought
closer together.

00:42:56.074 --> 00:43:02.104
Not that they have to forgive, it automatically
it works out.

00:43:02.104 --> 00:43:08.594
Just works out like that and people go on
joining such a man.

00:43:08.594 --> 00:43:13.574
I was surprised that in America they were
very, very few Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:13.574 --> 00:43:22.824
"We spend," they said, "Fifty thousand dollars
and got fifty Sahaja Yogis."

00:43:22.824 --> 00:43:27.374
One thousand for one Sahaja Yogi in America!

00:43:27.374 --> 00:43:36.414
So, very bad shape, but still, you see we
have to hope for them, because there are lots

00:43:36.414 --> 00:43:40.774
of seekers and lost in the wilderness of seeking.

00:43:40.774 --> 00:43:47.244
But I thought that maybe it's a circle.

00:43:47.244 --> 00:43:53.744
They have to pass through this circle of stupidity
and then definitely they will see the point

00:43:53.744 --> 00:43:56.314
and it has happened.

00:43:56.314 --> 00:44:04.844
We had about four thousand people for My lecture
which never has happened there in that country.

00:44:04.844 --> 00:44:10.584
"Nobody has got such a lot of audience," they
said.

00:44:10.584 --> 00:44:17.464
But still, not many came but they got their
Realization.

00:44:17.464 --> 00:44:21.904
So, I think gradually, even in America it
may start growing.

00:44:21.904 --> 00:44:30.694
And the Sahaja Yogis must not only worry about
their houses and where they live and all that,

00:44:30.694 --> 00:44:34.724
but go all out to them.

00:44:34.724 --> 00:44:40.424
I would say some of the Sahaja Yogis who could
afford to go, should go to America and work

00:44:40.424 --> 00:44:44.104
out this outside work.

00:44:44.104 --> 00:44:51.634
May be if there are outsiders who come and
talk about Sahaja Yoga, they might be impressed.

00:44:51.634 --> 00:44:59.414
There are so many false gurus that you can't
count them.

00:44:59.414 --> 00:45:01.134
And they have accepted them.

00:45:01.134 --> 00:45:06.514
It's very surprising, though they have suffered,
they have lost in money, everything, still

00:45:06.514 --> 00:45:10.274
they have accepted, "After all he is our guru!"

00:45:10.274 --> 00:45:15.474
So, there is basically something wrong with
their brains that they don't understand what

00:45:15.474 --> 00:45:19.734
is to be expected.

00:45:19.734 --> 00:45:21.064
I have written one book.

00:45:21.064 --> 00:45:27.404
Perhaps it may reach them, but in any case
you all can write your experiences and things

00:45:27.404 --> 00:45:28.824
and can publish it.

00:45:28.824 --> 00:45:31.714
Maybe it might help them to open their eyes.

00:45:31.714 --> 00:45:38.944
While writing anything, you have to remember
that it should show your quality of Sahaja

00:45:38.944 --> 00:45:42.604
Yoga, how you are.

00:45:42.604 --> 00:45:56.274
In that, one should not feel that you are
putting them down or trying to say some things

00:45:56.274 --> 00:46:03.534
which will hurt them, but say it in such a
manner that it corrects them and helps them.

00:46:03.534 --> 00:46:13.514
For a Guru, it is important that he should
not have any false ideas about himself.

00:46:13.514 --> 00:46:19.204
He might be from a poor family, might be from
the rich family.

00:46:19.204 --> 00:46:22.644
Whatever it is, he should not be conscious
of that.

00:46:22.644 --> 00:46:29.624
Because, once you become that ... See, look
at Kabira, he was just a weaver, look at Tridas,

00:46:29.624 --> 00:46:34.434
he was just a... what you call that?

00:46:34.434 --> 00:46:35.664
Shoemaker.

00:46:35.664 --> 00:46:44.064
See, in India these are very low castes, supposed
to be.

00:46:44.064 --> 00:46:46.544
He has written beautiful poetry.

00:46:46.544 --> 00:46:52.334
Then Namadeva, he was a tailor, just think
of that.

00:46:52.334 --> 00:47:00.294
All these people have written the same thing
with such great beauty of poetry.

00:47:00.294 --> 00:47:02.224
How have they achieved?

00:47:02.224 --> 00:47:07.974
Because, now they have entered into that great
realm of spirituality.

00:47:07.974 --> 00:47:13.444
You people also write some very good poetry,
I know.

00:47:13.444 --> 00:47:19.604
But some of the people who have written good
poetry turned out to be very obstinate, very

00:47:19.604 --> 00:47:20.604
egoistical people.

00:47:20.604 --> 00:47:23.304
This is something I couldn't understand.

00:47:23.304 --> 00:47:28.174
You are writing here a beautiful poetry and
here you are full of ego.

00:47:28.174 --> 00:47:33.594
So, from where this poetry is coming, God
knows.

00:47:33.594 --> 00:47:41.894
So, first of all is yourself, your personality
has to be something that people should say,

00:47:41.894 --> 00:47:47.164
"This is the real Guru we have met."

00:47:47.164 --> 00:47:57.524
For that, you know very well, you don't have
to give up your family, don't have to give

00:47:57.524 --> 00:47:58.654
up anything.

00:47:58.654 --> 00:48:09.874
But ego, if it is still there, I don't know
what to say, but you must get rid of it completely

00:48:09.874 --> 00:48:14.834
and collectively also, ego should be driven
out, collectively.

00:48:14.834 --> 00:48:22.024
It's a thing that, people are egoistical secretly
within themselves but sometimes it shows,

00:48:22.024 --> 00:48:30.874
it's a very subtle nonsensical disease that
people have and they just indulge into it.

00:48:30.874 --> 00:48:41.234
On this day of Guru Puja, I have to say now
that one has to work very hard, very hard.

00:48:41.234 --> 00:48:51.344
The most important thing is how much you have
dedicated your life, your time to Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:51.344 --> 00:48:54.204
Then only you will achieve that state of Guru.

00:48:54.204 --> 00:49:04.604
Look at Me, I'm a house wife and I have my
family's responsibilities, problems, but despite

00:49:04.604 --> 00:49:14.804
that, I'm all the time thinking about Sahaja
Yogis, Sahaja Yoga and all that is this emancipation

00:49:14.804 --> 00:49:19.884
of human beings in the whole world.

00:49:19.884 --> 00:49:25.074
Not only here or there, in the whole world.

00:49:25.074 --> 00:49:33.254
So, that should be your widened vision, not
for only your school, college, or university,

00:49:33.254 --> 00:49:41.144
your this or that but a very wider vision
one should have and that you have to develop

00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:52.894
through your working into every type of circumstances,
every type of problems you have.

00:49:52.894 --> 00:50:00.294
Once you develop that kind of a personality,
then you'll be amazed how you can help so

00:50:00.294 --> 00:50:01.294
many people.

00:50:01.294 --> 00:50:05.374
I know there are so many Sahaja Yogis here
who are worthy of praise and really I love

00:50:05.374 --> 00:50:18.164
them very much and they also love Me very
much, but one should always see that, as you

00:50:18.164 --> 00:50:27.664
are now going to be the Gurus, you have to
be careful not to think that you are a Guru.

00:50:27.664 --> 00:50:31.264
You should never think you are a guru already.

00:50:31.264 --> 00:50:37.504
Once you start thinking again Mr. Ego, the
guru, comes up.

00:50:37.504 --> 00:50:45.464
So, once you decide that "I'm nothing, I'm
nothing, I'm just a little ripple in the heart

00:50:45.464 --> 00:50:46.774
of my Mother."

00:50:46.774 --> 00:50:54.614
If such a humble feeling you get, then, all
your problems can be solved and things will

00:50:54.614 --> 00:50:55.614
work out.

00:50:55.614 --> 00:51:01.964
Because your attention and your behavior is
going to impress other people, nothing else.

00:51:01.964 --> 00:51:13.094
Whatever you may try, it is you who is going
to get Sahaja Yoga further.

00:51:13.094 --> 00:51:20.284
There is so much to be said about how to become
a good Guru and all that but I think I'll

00:51:20.284 --> 00:51:22.144
keep it for next Guru Puja.

00:51:22.144 --> 00:51:23.034
Thank you very much.
