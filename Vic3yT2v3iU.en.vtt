00:05:51.887 --> 00:06:00.468
Shri Mahakali Puja, Salvador-Bahia (Brazil), 14 October 1992.

00:06:04.173 --> 00:06:13.387
It is so nice to be here in Brazil in Salvador.

00:06:16.515 --> 00:06:19.458
I met one gentleman a long time back,

00:06:19.658 --> 00:06:24.617
from my husband’s office, from Brazil,

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:30.390
and his wife was suffering from terrible black magic.

00:06:51.871 --> 00:06:55.442
And she really was cured of that trouble.

00:07:00.238 --> 00:07:04.109
So he told me that, you have to go to Brazil

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:07.250
because it is full of lots of negative things

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:12.172
specially the black magic, so you must go there somehow.

00:07:23.413 --> 00:07:25.865
And so it was my great desire to come here

00:07:26.065 --> 00:07:29.503
and that’s how I came, few years back.

00:07:38.593 --> 00:07:42.187
Also Duilio was here and, I mean, things were arranged

00:07:42.387 --> 00:07:46.514
somehow, Sahaj, so I came here.

00:07:50.859 --> 00:07:59.047
So the problem of this country is more, is this black magic

00:07:59.247 --> 00:08:03.557
that is brought by the people from Africa.

00:08:14.985 --> 00:08:19.710
So I have thought today, we, let us have Mahakali Puja.

00:08:27.805 --> 00:08:33.627
Mahakali is the left side power in us.

00:08:39.167 --> 00:08:44.112
So, actually she is Adi Shakti.

00:08:49.533 --> 00:08:52.856
Only when she enters into the left side of the Virata

00:08:53.056 --> 00:08:59.516
we call her Mahakali, but she is the power of pure desire of God.

00:09:14.061 --> 00:09:19.037
Then she establishes Shri Ganesha herself.

00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:29.036
Then she goes to the right side as Mahasaraswati,

00:09:36.704 --> 00:09:44.005
and then she enters into the centre where she is Mahalakshmi.

00:09:50.727 --> 00:09:56.130
That is how Adi Shakti takes three forms.

00:10:02.186 --> 00:10:05.754
But Mahakali is the pure form,

00:10:05.954 --> 00:10:08.619
because she’s not yet deep in,

00:10:08.819 --> 00:10:13.684
I mean, from Adi Shakti, she’s Mahakali.

00:10:23.267 --> 00:10:27.699
So first thing she, before creating this universe or anything,

00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:31.391
she created Shri Ganesha.

00:10:38.035 --> 00:10:44.081
And first to spread, manifest

00:10:44.281 --> 00:10:52.461
not only holiness but also auspiciousness, and purity.

00:11:11.789 --> 00:11:14.755
So before anything was created,

00:11:14.955 --> 00:11:17.438
these spiritual forces were created,

00:11:17.638 --> 00:11:22.156
to protect the creation that was to follow.

00:11:35.442 --> 00:11:40.949
So this Mahakali force was specially in the purest form

00:11:41.149 --> 00:11:46.424
to protect people from the negative side.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.177
Now when any thought enters our mind,

00:12:04.377 --> 00:12:10.805
any reasoning concept of our mind,

00:12:11.006 --> 00:12:15.783
it is thrown on the left side by this Mahakali.

00:12:15.984 --> 00:12:20.424
- Throw out? - Goes to the left side. Subconscious.

00:12:20.624 --> 00:12:24.353
- Every bad thought ? No. - See whatever thought comes to us.

00:12:24.553 --> 00:12:30.544
Today is the support now, just now, that goes to the left side, has.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:45.242
And then that is how the present becomes the past,

00:12:45.442 --> 00:12:49.260
goes to the subconscious.

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:57.062
Now the subconscious also has many layers

00:12:57.262 --> 00:13:01.929
which are on the left side in a parallel way,

00:13:02.129 --> 00:13:06.629
not horizontally, but parallel.

00:13:18.745 --> 00:13:21.674
There are seven of these layers,

00:13:21.874 --> 00:13:29.271
and the seventh one ends up into the Collective Subconscious.

00:13:39.875 --> 00:13:42.601
So whatever is dead, in the past,

00:13:42.801 --> 00:13:47.537
and was discarded from the evolutionary process,

00:13:47.737 --> 00:13:52.164
is thrown into the Collective Subconscious.

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:10.885
Now when –

00:14:11.085 --> 00:14:16.963
say for example, lives which were thrown out of the evolution,

00:14:17.163 --> 00:14:21.677
microscopic animals, whatever, viruses,

00:14:21.877 --> 00:14:24.234
then also human beings, animals,

00:14:24.434 --> 00:14:28.305
everything that was thrown, like mammoths and all that,

00:14:28.505 --> 00:14:33.826
these animals were thrown out of the evolution, are.

00:14:55.445 --> 00:15:00.792
So the people who are living more in the past,

00:15:00.992 --> 00:15:10.595
if by any accident or by any unhappy incident in life,

00:15:10.795 --> 00:15:15.343
are thrown towards that, they catch

00:15:15.543 --> 00:15:21.162
some of this Collective Subconscious.

00:15:41.598 --> 00:15:47.147
So also, this lifetime, whatever conditionings we have,

00:15:47.347 --> 00:15:56.196
also pass into our, they pass into our subconscious mind.

00:16:06.466 --> 00:16:14.735
For example, a person is sitting in the darkness alone,

00:16:14.935 --> 00:16:18.380
suddenly starts feeling the fear.

00:16:18.580 --> 00:16:23.721
Then he is, with that fear, he’s thrown towards the left side

00:16:23.921 --> 00:16:28.180
and he can catch something, what we call as ‘bhoots’, you see,

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.950
what we call bhoots is some sort of a dead spirit

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:36.382
and then he becomes a different person.

00:16:59.417 --> 00:17:02.829
Also, somebody who is too much right-sided, is always active,

00:17:03.029 --> 00:17:07.695
thinking too much of the future,

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:18.496
his attention moves to the extreme, say, to the right side.

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:26.342
Then suddenly if some shock or some fear, or whatever it is,

00:17:26.542 --> 00:17:32.368
this pendulum like thing, can move to the other side also.

00:17:42.169 --> 00:17:44.812
So all the people who are very right-sided

00:17:45.012 --> 00:17:50.312
can get into problems of possessions

00:17:50.512 --> 00:17:52.543
Sahaja Yogi : Of subconscious?
Shri Mataji : Of possessions.

00:17:52.744 --> 00:17:56.678
Sahaja Yogi : But, of subconscious?
Shri Mataji : Subconscious also.

00:18:07.923 --> 00:18:16.774
Also people who are extremely meticulous, extremely futuristic,

00:18:16.974 --> 00:18:21.991
can catch on the right side also Collective Supraconscious.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:41.999
Shri Mataji corrects him : Supraconcious.. Right side, it’s the right side. Futuristic.

00:18:43.841 --> 00:18:49.587
Now the - We have to now understand MahaKali’s powers.

00:18:50.954 --> 00:18:55.739
We have to understnd now Mahakali's Powers.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:06.633
Now MahaKali’s powers are such that She is the Holy Ghost.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:22.318
So firstly She can cure any diseases that come from viruses,

00:19:28.588 --> 00:19:31.919
like say from AIDS. You can start from Mooladhara up,

00:19:32.119 --> 00:19:36.300
all Mooladhara diseases, then all Swadisthana diseases,

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:40.341
all these diseases.

00:19:51.549 --> 00:19:54.987
Left Vishuddhi of course, is a combination,

00:19:55.187 --> 00:20:00.511
because when a man is too right-sided to balance his ego

00:20:00.711 --> 00:20:04.966
he puts it here in the guilt.

00:20:19.616 --> 00:20:26.080
So it could be a combination of both right and left.

00:20:31.838 --> 00:20:36.790
But all other incurable diseases are left-sided.

00:20:41.953 --> 00:20:46.653
Like you have cancer.

00:20:47.541 --> 00:20:50.054
Now see this is the left side centre

00:20:50.254 --> 00:20:54.748
and this is the right side centre, they look like this.

00:20:58.867 --> 00:21:01.025
So this is left side, this is right side

00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:05.160
and in the centre is the centre.

00:21:11.529 --> 00:21:15.530
Now supposing even if you have a thing of the right side, too much,

00:21:15.731 --> 00:21:20.305
the energy is driven to the right side.

00:21:30.782 --> 00:21:34.249
But suddenly something may happen, you see, some accident,

00:21:34.449 --> 00:21:39.037
some sort of unhappiness and this little bit can break like that,

00:21:39.237 --> 00:21:42.634
from the left side.

00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:58.934
So the virus can start flowing into the right side also.

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:08.379
Now when this virus enters into the right side

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:13.132
you have no connection with the whole, because it’s broken now.

00:22:22.283 --> 00:22:26.083
So this right side starts working on its own

00:22:26.283 --> 00:22:31.396
and that’s how you develop this cancer

00:22:31.596 --> 00:22:33.999
where the cell itself becomes the ego,

00:22:34.199 --> 00:22:39.346
it gets the ego and it starts multiplying, multiplying.

00:23:02.226 --> 00:23:07.225
So this virus can give you any kind of disease,

00:23:07.425 --> 00:23:10.217
which cannot be cured by medical science

00:23:10.417 --> 00:23:15.726
because medical science deals with the right side of the physical side.

00:23:33.395 --> 00:23:40.761
But the mental side is dealt with by Mahakali power, mental side.

00:23:46.015 --> 00:23:49.583
That is how in Sahaja Yoga we have been able to cure

00:23:49.784 --> 00:23:53.745
many incurable diseases.

00:23:59.513 --> 00:24:03.718
By using candles,

00:24:03.918 --> 00:24:10.344
because the light when it is shown to these viruses,

00:24:10.544 --> 00:24:14.870
or to the bhoots, they go away.

00:24:25.692 --> 00:24:27.929
So by three-candle treatment you can cure

00:24:28.129 --> 00:24:32.971
any one of these incurable diseases, even AIDS.

00:24:42.195 --> 00:24:48.950
But when this trouble starts above the Vishuddhi chakra

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.387
or from the Vishuddhi chakra,

00:24:51.587 --> 00:24:54.339
then people become mentally handicapped,

00:24:54.539 --> 00:24:58.459
like they become mad, they get epilepsy

00:24:58.659 --> 00:25:04.809
or they get what we call schizophrenic.

00:25:16.937 --> 00:25:22.540
Now what they do when they do black magic, we should understand.

00:25:30.989 --> 00:25:34.139
In India we call it preta vidya, smashana vidya.

00:25:34.339 --> 00:25:37.139
Preta vidya means the dead, knowledge of the dead

00:25:37.339 --> 00:25:44.319
and smashana vidya is the knowledge of the cemetery.

00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.143
Sahaja Yogi: Preta vidya? Shri Mataji: Yes, preta vidya.

00:25:47.343 --> 00:25:52.382
Sahaja Yogi: Preta also in Brazilian means black. In Brazilian, black.

00:25:52.582 --> 00:25:56.590
But “preta” means dead.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:10.690
And another is “smashana vidya” means of the, of the cemetery.

00:26:16.296 --> 00:26:21.699
So the way they do it is that when some evil genius is dead,

00:26:21.899 --> 00:26:23.887
when they know that somebody is dead,

00:26:24.087 --> 00:26:26.744
then these people go there

00:26:26.944 --> 00:26:33.544
and try to wait until everybody disappears.

00:26:38.274 --> 00:26:41.741
They burn in India, they burn the body in India

00:26:41.941 --> 00:26:47.386
and when the brain is opened it makes a sound.

00:26:47.587 --> 00:26:53.126
After that people go away. So, they are still there.

00:27:21.462 --> 00:27:25.748
And then they take the skull of that man,

00:27:25.948 --> 00:27:30.097
or some part of the body with them, maybe some bones,

00:27:30.297 --> 00:27:35.876
so that the Spirit, which is hovering there, follows them.

00:27:58.381 --> 00:28:01.506
And then they give some names to these bhoots

00:28:01.706 --> 00:28:04.189
who are following them and then they, somehow or other,

00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:08.944
tie them up, you see, they imprison them.

00:28:19.633 --> 00:28:23.641
And then they use these bhoots to entice someone,

00:28:23.841 --> 00:28:27.587
to mesmerise someone.

00:28:32.519 --> 00:28:35.293
And these bhoots can get more bhoots also with them

00:28:35.493 --> 00:28:37.629
to entice them more if these people want,

00:28:37.829 --> 00:28:44.326
just because they are now captured and they are evil geniuses.

00:28:52.751 --> 00:28:55.139
So, this is what the false guru do, that

00:28:55.339 --> 00:28:59.577
they put these bhoots on people, mesmerise them.

00:28:59.778 --> 00:29:01.766
Through their eyes these bhoots come in

00:29:01.966 --> 00:29:04.430
and then these people start giving all their money,

00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:07.041
all the property, everything to them,

00:29:07.241 --> 00:29:11.535
even the women give up their chastity.

00:29:16.968 --> 00:29:20.777
Anywhere.

00:29:58.191 --> 00:30:02.699
So, this is how they try to mesmerise.

00:30:11.522 --> 00:30:15.250
Also, they can use these bhoots for killing somebody

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:19.821
or for beating somebody, putting somebody into trouble,

00:30:20.021 --> 00:30:23.966
all kinds of things.

00:30:28.869 --> 00:30:34.122
So also, they try to sort of put ideas into people,

00:30:34.322 --> 00:30:41.532
make them violent and make them very bad people, dirty people.

00:30:50.968 --> 00:30:55.237
This unnatural sex relationship, like homosexuality and all that.

00:30:55.438 --> 00:30:59.872
that is also from bhoots.

00:31:10.945 --> 00:31:17.802
That is, they do everything that is anti, you can say, Mahakali.

00:31:22.254 --> 00:31:26.213
And that is how they may bring inauspiciousness,

00:31:26.413 --> 00:31:32.471
unholiness, violence, all kinds of problems.

00:31:41.223 --> 00:31:45.316
Now supposing, if these bhoots are, say, drunkards,

00:31:45.516 --> 00:31:50.143
then they make people drink too much.

00:31:57.805 --> 00:32:02.990
Or if they are, say, cheats or people who have been making money

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:08.165
by wrong methods, they can also enter into the heads of people.

00:32:08.365 --> 00:32:12.014
Like here I think the politicians, they have entered into their heads,

00:32:12.214 --> 00:32:16.515
so they are like mad people now.

00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:38.659
And this is how the dharma is not there anymore,

00:32:38.859 --> 00:32:42.976
there is no dharma, there are no maryadhas, nothing

00:32:43.176 --> 00:32:47.430
and they do what they like.

00:32:54.662 --> 00:32:57.739
So, the hundred and eight names of the Goddess

00:32:57.939 --> 00:33:03.945
or the one thousand names of the Goddess are mostly for Mahakali,

00:33:04.145 --> 00:33:09.682
on the left-hand side, because she killed so many rakshasas.

00:33:22.137 --> 00:33:26.778
She destroys also viruses and all kinds of things

00:33:26.978 --> 00:33:31.767
which are inflicted on human beings.

00:33:38.664 --> 00:33:42.636
Also, she cures many things like conditionings,

00:33:42.836 --> 00:33:47.463
say for example, of the Catholic church,

00:33:53.474 --> 00:33:57.274
which has given a conditioning into human beings

00:33:57.474 --> 00:34:03.456
that they cannot ascend, because of this Catholic church conditioning.

00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:16.238
So even if you believe in someone, supposing there is a Sahaja Yogi

00:34:16.438 --> 00:34:19.595
and you believe that this Sahaja Yogi is God,

00:34:19.795 --> 00:34:23.712
then you can catch also.

00:34:42.884 --> 00:34:47.223
Because if you believe in anybody who has no authority,

00:34:47.423 --> 00:34:53.090
it is unauthorised “shraddha” [faith], then you get into trouble.

00:35:02.308 --> 00:35:05.927
So, in Sahaja Yoga nobody should consider somebody as guru

00:35:06.128 --> 00:35:08.299
because he has given you Realization or something,

00:35:08.499 --> 00:35:12.323
he is not your guru.

00:35:20.267 --> 00:35:24.506
And the best way to get rid of it is through the Mother Earth

00:35:24.706 --> 00:35:27.542
because she sucks in, recedes the left side.

00:35:27.742 --> 00:35:31.341
The Mother Earth sucks in your problems.

00:35:42.118 --> 00:35:46.313
So, if you just put your left hand towards the light

00:35:46.513 --> 00:35:50.582
and your right hand on the Mother Earth, from the light, you see,

00:35:50.782 --> 00:35:55.702
negativity runs and goes into the Mother Earth.

00:36:12.965 --> 00:36:16.115
They use the same thing, like lemons they will use, you see,

00:36:16.315 --> 00:36:18.551
in the lemon they will put bhoots

00:36:18.751 --> 00:36:21.123
and they put this lemon to somebody

00:36:21.323 --> 00:36:25.363
so that, that person gets possessed.

00:36:42.771 --> 00:36:46.453
While we remove the lemon that absorbs the bhoots

00:36:46.653 --> 00:36:49.280
and then put the lemon in the water.

00:36:58.431 --> 00:37:00.691
Then another thing, there is the light, you see.

00:37:00.891 --> 00:37:04.580
Supposing you put the light without Me being there,

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:08.355
my photograph not being there, then the bhoots start,

00:37:08.555 --> 00:37:13.055
you see, getting more upset with the light.

00:37:24.318 --> 00:37:29.096
And it attracts more bhoots to protect itself.

00:37:37.616 --> 00:37:42.846
But in the presence of my photograph, the photograph emits vibrations

00:37:43.046 --> 00:37:48.156
which make all the bhoots run away.

00:38:01.172 --> 00:38:06.465
Because the light also, this light, gets awakened

00:38:06.665 --> 00:38:11.038
in front of my photograph.

00:38:15.887 --> 00:38:23.385
So, this is the contrast in which we can achieve

00:38:23.585 --> 00:38:28.570
results of getting rid of problems.

00:38:36.935 --> 00:38:39.150
But I would suggest that Sahaja Yogis

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:43.927
should not directly treat these people.

00:38:49.711 --> 00:38:52.258
They can put them before my photograph

00:38:52.459 --> 00:38:57.524
and use the three candles treatment but not touch.

00:39:14.343 --> 00:39:20.111
Before doing anything, they should take a bandhan also.

00:39:27.502 --> 00:39:29.525
So, whenever you take your bandhan,

00:39:29.725 --> 00:39:33.431
you are taking the bandhan of Mahakali,

00:39:38.806 --> 00:39:42.884
because she protects you.

00:39:43.084 --> 00:39:48.580
After some time, when you have reached a certain stage of ascent,

00:39:48.789 --> 00:39:53.401
the bhoots run away, if they see you, they run away.

00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:09.091
Or they will start shaking before you.

00:40:13.559 --> 00:40:16.708
And ask such a person to put his hands towards the light

00:40:16.908 --> 00:40:20.337
with my photograph. The light will go up and down

00:40:20.537 --> 00:40:24.934
and black soot will come out.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:46.797
So, the left side is called as Tamo guna, the right side is Rajo guna

00:40:46.997 --> 00:40:51.098
and the centre as Satwo guna.

00:40:55.986 --> 00:41:03.986
Now, Tamo guna means a left-sided personality.

00:41:05.612 --> 00:41:10.713
He is the one who always runs into some darkness

00:41:10.913 --> 00:41:13.649
and he’s secretive and he’s sly

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:18.397
and you don’t know how he-what he’s [inaudible].

00:41:29.611 --> 00:41:33.912
And to look at, he looks very humble

00:41:34.112 --> 00:41:39.557
and he never answers you back but he does everything at your back.

00:41:49.835 --> 00:41:54.906
You cannot make out his mischiefs till he may hurt you.

00:42:03.526 --> 00:42:07.794
Now, a right-sided person is on the contrary extremely aggressive

00:42:07.994 --> 00:42:13.674
and sort of tries to show off.

00:42:24.153 --> 00:42:28.328
But the Satwo guna is in the balance.

00:42:33.974 --> 00:42:36.687
But on your vibrations, you can make it out

00:42:36.887 --> 00:42:41.045
what are the problems of the person.

00:42:50.582 --> 00:42:56.225
Last night, for example, my whole Swadishthana was burning.

00:43:03.417 --> 00:43:08.089
Even the children will show by putting their thumb in the mouth.

00:43:13.487 --> 00:43:17.319
So, this is what is the left Swadishthana and for left Swadishthana,

00:43:17.519 --> 00:43:20.723
the mantra is Mahakali’s mantra and another

00:43:20.923 --> 00:43:26.045
very important mantra for left Swadishthana is that,

00:43:26.245 --> 00:43:30.849
“Mother, you are the pure knowledge”.

00:43:48.662 --> 00:43:51.168
But for Christians it is better even to say,

00:43:51.368 --> 00:43:56.627
“Mother you are the Holy Ghost", like Christ has said.

00:44:07.428 --> 00:44:12.291
It is really easy to get rid of these things if you just decide that

00:44:12.491 --> 00:44:16.833
“I’m not having anything to do with that.”

00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:26.529
And these bhoots are so stupid, that,

00:44:26.729 --> 00:44:28.927
supposing someone may come to my house,

00:44:29.128 --> 00:44:32.315
take off their coat, put some other shawl on them,

00:44:32.515 --> 00:44:36.726
when they go, the bhoots can’t recognize them.

00:44:36.926 --> 00:44:39.425
- They are so stupid. - The bhoots that are in the shawl?

00:44:39.625 --> 00:44:42.425
No, no, no, somebody comes to meet Me.

00:44:42.625 --> 00:44:45.353
And I take out the bhoots, you see, he’ll go out somewhere.

00:44:45.553 --> 00:44:47.481
The bhoots come inside the house also.

00:44:47.682 --> 00:44:50.122
Then you make him wear something else

00:44:50.322 --> 00:44:54.505
so the person changes his dress. So, they can’t make you out.

00:44:54.706 --> 00:44:58.909
They are so stupid.

00:45:10.966 --> 00:45:17.014
Just come here because there’s sumn there, both of you.

00:45:46.967 --> 00:45:49.196
So, this is Mahakali’s great work

00:45:49.396 --> 00:45:52.148
and I have already told you how she works it out.

00:45:52.348 --> 00:45:54.513
Now today we are going to worship her,

00:45:54.713 --> 00:45:57.825
I’m sure she will become very powerful here

00:45:58.025 --> 00:46:03.573
and she will see to it that all this black magic is finished.

00:46:23.193 --> 00:46:26.207
These Mahakali’s powers you will start seeing

00:46:26.407 --> 00:46:31.492
and when she starts manifesting, your politicians will improve,

00:46:31.692 --> 00:46:36.730
everything will improve, because it is under these wrong powers

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:40.997
you see that they are doing these things.

00:46:55.437 --> 00:46:58.333
Also all these bad things like violence and

00:46:58.533 --> 00:47:01.444
all kinds of bad things people do

00:47:01.644 --> 00:47:06.618
is only under the influence of negativity.

00:47:13.636 --> 00:47:16.374
Even if they know this is wrong, it should not be done,

00:47:16.574 --> 00:47:21.026
they do it compulsively, compulsively.

00:47:31.671 --> 00:47:35.159
Now a new disease has come where people have compulsive habits,

00:47:35.359 --> 00:47:39.980
like washing their hands all the time, or

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:43.310
I mean all these compulsive habits are done

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:47.525
like somebody’s brushing their teeth three hundred times,

00:47:47.725 --> 00:47:51.953
somebody washing their hands, somebody very particular about everything,

00:47:52.153 --> 00:47:56.744
all the time cleaning, cleaning.

00:48:15.788 --> 00:48:19.866
Some women are like that, if anything falls off, they must run, clean,

00:48:20.066 --> 00:48:24.671
and they have no time to sit down for five minutes.

00:48:34.457 --> 00:48:39.531
They can’t help it, they can’t help it.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:45.801
Ultimately they get out of society because they are absolutely useless.

00:48:53.119 --> 00:48:58.244
So, I have now tried to tell you the various things that

00:48:58.444 --> 00:49:04.693
this absence of Mahakali can manifest.

00:49:13.103 --> 00:49:17.657
So, the Mahakali’s manifestation is so important for a country

00:49:17.857 --> 00:49:22.754
where there are so many negativities.

00:49:30.846 --> 00:49:34.189
And I hope next time I come, this will be very much reduced

00:49:34.389 --> 00:49:40.944
and worked out, we’ll have a much cleaner place.

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:57.949
Now you people also now know how to cure left Swadishthana.

00:49:58.149 --> 00:50:03.903
Always check up the left Swadishthana and try to cure it.

00:50:12.496 --> 00:50:18.005
May God bless you all.

00:50:24.671 --> 00:50:28.195
- Can you get some children? - Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:50:35.755 --> 00:50:40.382
And Ganesha is most important for Mahakali.
