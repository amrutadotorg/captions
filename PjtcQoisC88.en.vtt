00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Today again is 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.870
a new year's day. Every new year comes, because
we have to take to something that is new.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:14.300
It has been so arranged that the sun has to
move for 365 days and again a new year has

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:22.789
come.
Actually the whole Solar System is moving

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:31.180
in a spiral way. So, there is definitely a
higher, higher state of this Solar System.

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:41.719
Every year it is rising higher in a spiral
way. So it is not only that it is because

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:50.889
365 days have passed, it is because it has
moved a step forward, higher than what it

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:59.960
was.
Now, we can see that in awareness, human beings

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:06.960
have definitely risen much higher than what
they were, say, about 2000 years back. But,

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:15.300
the first system that started the whole Universe
was the first model, you can say was created.

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:25.669
And that model has to be perfect. And that
was a perfect model which then started perfecting

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:32.439
the rest of it.
So that is the perfect model which is in the

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:39.439
principle of this ascent. And that is working
out this ascent. Now, the perfection of the

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:53.669
rest of the universe takes place in various
directions.

00:07:53.669 --> 00:08:00.669
But today we have to consider the Mahalakshmi
Principle. The Mahalakshmi, as I told you,

00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:09.599
is a perfect principle. It's a perfect principle.
It's perfected. It is born as perfect, will

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:16.710
remain as perfect, will be always eternally
perfect so that it is not necessary to be

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:22.240
corrected.
Now this Mahalakshmi's thing I am discussing

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:29.240
here because you may be able to go today to
see the temple of Mahalakshmi. Now the temple

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:40.950
of Mahalakshmi when you go there, you have
to know that this deity has come out of the

00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:48.089
Mother Earth in this particular place. That
means this place has got a capacity to give

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:59.720
you a force. You can say, an additional force
or an intensive feeling of evolution. If you

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:08.520
are sensitive enough you can see that, you
can feel it and you can do it. But, if you

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:15.290
are not so sensitive, you are still so conditioned
and still outside, that may not work out.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:22.290
I mean all kinds of things can be done, but
if somebody wants to remain a stone you can't

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:28.649
do anything about it.
So this Mahalakshmi principle is working out

00:09:28.649 --> 00:09:35.649
in this place Kolhapur. Normally, this place
should be very, very warm because of its position.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:42.890
But even in summer this place keeps very cool
because of the vibrations from the temple

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:51.050
that is emitted. The people in this place
may not be so aware either. We cannot say

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:59.940
if they are aware because, as negativity has
to come forward, there are lots of sugar factories

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:06.940
and lots of alcoholism going on here.
But we have to take the best advantage of

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:16.880
every place which is created specially for
a particular purpose. So, it is a pilgrimage,

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:23.880
in a way, that we are here. That we have to
look after our Mahalakshmi Principle of our

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:32.370
ascent. As you know, this ascent starts at
the Nabhi and is surrounded by the Guru principle.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:44.650
Now the Guru Principle within us, if it is
absurd, if it is juxtapositioned, placed in

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:52.280
juxtaposition where, if it is not properly
embedded within us, if it is not emitting

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:58.620
through our character and behaviour, Mahalakshmi
tattwa cannot be strengthened.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:05.620
Mahalakshmi tattwa is strengthened through
Guru principle. Now we are lucky today because

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.000
there was the birthday of Datta, Dattatreya,
just the other day, when we had the puja,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.340
and today is this Mahalakshmi puja. So two
things together we have got together. First

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:25.960
was the Datta puja and today is this puja
of Mahalakshmi. So, to have the Guru principle

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:32.010
all right, we must make our dharmas correct.
Now these dharmas, as I have told you many

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:39.010
times, are ten, and we should look after these
ten dharmas in a very careful manner. These

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.830
are expressed outside, but whatever is inside
comes out.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:50.840
Now I find, when you people talk, and you
say things, I know that this person is negative,

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:56.440
that person is definitely positive. There
are so many ways of expression of positivity.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:03.030
But how I know that, I cannot tell you, because
I just don't know how to tell you that. But

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:09.140
I just know that such a person is definitely
positive and such a person is negative. The

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:16.140
positivity lies in understanding why are we
here. First of all, why are we on this earth?

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:25.810
Why are we human beings? In understanding!
What are we doing about it? Why are we Sahaja

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Yogis? What a Sahaja Yogi has to do? What
is his responsibility as a Sahaja Yogi. Then

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:46.090
he moves forward to understand -- why Mother
is so kind to me? Why have I got vibrations?

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:57.120
Why am I among very few who have got this
special blessing, the special knowledge of

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:04.120
vibratory awareness. And then to ask yourself,
"What am I doing about it? Am I still very

00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:16.550
much embedded in my cheapishness or in my
childishness, in my stupidity, in my harshness,

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:21.150
in my aggressiveness?"
We always see these things in other people,

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:26.100
not in ourselves -- so we are not Sahaja Yogis.
We should understand at that point. When we

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.310
start seeing these things in other people,
then we are not Sahaja Yogis. We should see

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:37.310
in ourselves and emit pure compassion to others.
But always people see that it is in another

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:47.520
person this exists. Whatever I may try to
say they always see in other person. Now supposing

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:53.360
there's a negative person among us, you need
not be compassionate to that person. On the

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:58.200
contrary better be away. Get rid of that person,
as far as possible don't have anything to

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:05.150
do [with them]. Is a definite sign of great
compassion to yourself, if not to others.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:10.310
Better not have anything to do with the person
who is negative, if you have to come up. He

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:17.310
may be your brother, sister, anyone. But try
to be away from a person who is not positive.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:24.500
It causes lots of problems. I have been telling
you this, and I have been requesting you,

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:30.160
but the conditioning is such that, still though
you have become a Guru tattwa, you don't understand

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.340
that you have to be detached.
For the Guru there's no brother, sister or

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:40.190
any other relationship except for the relationship
of the Mother. There is no other relationship.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:47.020
One of these principles are to be understood.
Very important I feel is for all of you that

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:53.760
-- our relationship is only to Mother and
to Sahaja Yogis and not to any relationship

00:14:53.760 --> 00:15:00.600
which has come to us, whether through Sahaja
Yoga or whether through anything else. Now

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:07.600
this I have been explaining because our Mahalakshmi
Tattwa is not all right. That's why we get,

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:16.240
sort of, frittered away, lost, into these
things. And the Mahalakshmi tattwa has to

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:26.360
be like an ascending force all put together.
Like my father used to give an example. That

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:33.390
supposing you have collected lot of wheat
and you spread it on the ground, it will be

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.700
all lost. It will be spread out like this,
this side, that side, it will be all lost.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:45.880
But if you put it in a bag, it will rise in
height. Naturally! It will have those maryadas.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:51.890
It will rise and it will go higher and higher.
In the same way this principle of Mahalakshmi

00:15:51.890 --> 00:15:58.890
can spread just across like that, and can
just destroy all that Mother has given us

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:08.170
and all that we have had all these years,
only by spreading it out.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:14.240
Now to collect it inside, is to pay attention
to yourself. First of all, try to clarify

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:21.240
your ideas and your understanding in [the]
brain. Is important, because Mahalakshmi tattwa

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:27.610
ultimately works in the brain. Is the enlightenment
of the brain, is done by Mahalakshmi tattwa.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:32.220
It gives you the Sat, the Truth, you see.
So in the brain you must clarify. Reach logically.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:39.220
Logically you must reach the conclusion, "I
don't have to do these things, I have to do

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:50.740
these things. I have to ascend. This is why
I am here. Why I am here? What am I supposed

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:59.910
to do?" Now logically you convince your brain,
first of all. This is very important now,

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:05.569
after realisation. Because if logically your
brain doesn't understand, it will always be

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:12.569
cheapish, childish, indignified or could be
harsh, horribly oppressive. It could be one

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:18.919
of these.
So, in Guru tattwa, there are ten elements.

00:17:18.919 --> 00:17:25.919
Five of them deal with the weight. Weight.
Guru is the weight you see. Weight of a person.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:34.820
How much weight you have got? The gravity,
as we call it. Person has a gravity. When

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:38.299
he talks how much balance he has got. See
in Indian Music, we call it Vazan, means the

00:17:38.299 --> 00:17:45.299
weight. The weight of the person, means when
he is dealing with himself or with others,

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:51.010
how much weight he carried. In English also
they use this -- weight. How much weight he

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:56.299
carries with others? Means, how much he can
really impress others? If you impress too

00:17:56.299 --> 00:18:01.919
much, all right, then the person will say,
'Oh, it's too much.' That is the very big

00:18:01.919 --> 00:18:08.720
quality with western people is, "Oh, that
is too much!" That's because they have an

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.890
idea, you see. This is all ego oriented. That
is too much. If you tell them too much, "Oh!

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:19.520
that is too much. She is too much. I do it
slowly, slowly. It is too much for me!" Is

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:23.549
very common, is very common reaction. So how
much weight you have.

00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:30.549
And the second one is the quality of magnetic.
Two things. Magnetism. First is the quality

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:40.080
of weight. That's how much dignified you are.
How you talk. How your language is. How your

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:49.559
behaviour is. You should be humorous, but
sometimes, even with me, I find people talk

00:18:50.809 --> 00:18:56.669
in a very funny manner. I just don't understand,
how is it that always they say the wrong things?

00:18:56.669 --> 00:19:00.580
I mean, even if they have to say one sentence,
they'll say a wrong thing. Is absolutely with

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:05.769
them. It is also Vishuddhi, which is also
Nabhi, comes from Nabhi, because you must

00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:09.669
know that Vishuddhi Chakra is the ascent of
the Nabhi Chakra.

00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:15.850
So what happens, that a person whatever he
is, is expressed through his language, through

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:20.169
his behaviour, through his face, through his
nose, his eyes, everything, through the Vishuddhi

00:19:20.169 --> 00:19:23.940
Chakra. So the ascent of the Nabhi is expressed,
shown, through the Vishuddhi Chakra. Now whatever

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:30.940
you have in the Nabhi is shown here. Supposing
now, a person who has the Mahalakshmi tattwa

00:19:32.539 --> 00:19:36.190
properly developed, such a person will have
a way of dealing with another person where

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:43.190
he will have the weight as well as the understanding
[of] how far to go with the person. How far

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:55.860
to carry on with the person. How far to talk
to a person. How far to think about it. How

00:19:57.049 --> 00:20:00.919
much importance to be given. That's one point,
is very important.

00:20:00.919 --> 00:20:07.340
And the another point is that -- how much
magnetism you have? So you reverse back to

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:14.340
yourself. The magnetism is a magic, is a magic
of a person. A person is magnetic because

00:20:15.009 --> 00:20:22.009
he has certain magic. Now this magic is, comes,
from your own personality. From your own personality.

00:20:23.909 --> 00:20:30.909
The basis of magnetism, on the left hand side,
starts. And that basis is Shri Ganesha. Shri

00:20:31.559 --> 00:20:38.210
Ganesha is the basis of that magnetism. So
you're innocent. Innocence is the best way

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:45.129
to have that magnetism. Magnetism you cannot
express in material way. It's not a material

00:20:45.129 --> 00:20:52.129
stuff but it is something abstract, comes
from your quality of Ganesha, Shri Ganesha.

00:20:52.889 --> 00:20:59.759
Such a person is magnetic. Magnetic means
that such a person attracts other person because

00:20:59.759 --> 00:21:06.759
of the weight of the person, because of the
quality of the person such a person attracts.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:14.230
But does not attract for lust, greed and nonsensical
things. But attracts another person because

00:21:15.279 --> 00:21:21.960
of the fragrance of love in the subjects.
Now it is always confused. Confused!. Because

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.960
it's such an abstract thing so one must understand
it in a very subtle way. What is this magnetism?

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:31.360
That one should understand. You see, there
some gestures people use artificially. Which

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:36.019
normally they have been using just to attract
other people, the way they walk, the way they

00:21:36.019 --> 00:21:42.529
dress, the way they live. All these things
are of no use. It is something so inner, that

00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:49.369
fragrance is so inner which must be developed.
But in Sahaja Yoga I have seen, people just

00:21:49.369 --> 00:21:52.830
don't bother about it, just don't bother.
They think the way they have been living,

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:57.059
the way they have been this...say, if they
are English, they are English, if they are

00:21:57.059 --> 00:22:00.100
French they are French, if they are Indians
they are Indians, if they are from Kolhapur

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:07.100
they will be from Kolhapur. These ideas first
must be curbed off, because the fragrance

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:11.989
spreads everywhere whether you are English
or anyone.

00:22:11.989 --> 00:22:17.600
So the fragrance of a person develops through,
first of all, the Ganesha principle within

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:24.600
you. Ganesha principle is to be first of all
seen to. Now a Ganesha person is not a person

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:31.960
who is absolutely a remorse type or a person
who is such a gone case that even if you beat

00:22:35.059 --> 00:22:42.059
him up and make him into a complete minced
thing, he will bear it. It's not like that!

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:50.470
It's not that. On the contrary the quality
of magnetism is such that it attracts you,

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:57.610
to a point where you are not disturbed. Now
this is a very important point we should know.

00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:05.340
You see, if you have other loves, love like
carnal love and all other love you have, then

00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:10.090
that love you may attract the person. That
person can destroy you and it destroys you,

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:17.090
always. But this attraction does not destroy,
does not destroy. The attraction is up to

00:23:18.809 --> 00:23:24.980
that point that you are not destroyed, because
you being much higher, much deeper and much

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:31.100
weightier, you cannot be destroyed by a thing
that you are attracting. Always the greater

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:38.100
magnet attracts the smaller magnet. And that
is what one should understand. This magic

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:46.950
and this karishma, the charismatic temperament
of a person comes by, first of all, the Ganesh

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:53.519
tattwa, innocence. And secondly by complete
dedication and devotion.

00:23:53.519 --> 00:24:00.519
Those who are completely dedicated and devoted
to Mother. Not to anything else. Ganesh tattwa

00:24:04.159 --> 00:24:10.070
again. Not to your wife, not to your husband,
not to your sister, not to your country, not

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:17.070
to anyone but to Mother. Complete dedication
gives you that charisma, or that attraction.

00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:29.659
In Sahaja Yoga such a person becomes really
attractive and such a person has ??????.

00:24:29.659 --> 00:24:36.659
Now some 

00:24:41.769 --> 00:24:48.769
people think that if you are a very passive
person and if anybody says anything to you

00:24:51.779 --> 00:24:58.779
and you don't mind, sort of a person you are
charismatic. It is not. People like you because

00:24:59.989 --> 00:25:06.989
they can dominate you. They like you because
they can dominate you. Now if you think that

00:25:07.289 --> 00:25:13.029
by your aggressiveness and by your shouting
and by your screaming at these people, you

00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:20.029
will achieve that charismatic temperament,
you cannot. You cannot achieve that height.

00:25:23.059 --> 00:25:28.850
So how do you achieve it? By becoming more
innocent.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:35.850
Now how innocence develops in a person is
by not thinking about it. Like, you see, somebody

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:43.070
asked me, 'How do you manage your Income Tax?'
I said, 'By having no income at all'. Then

00:25:43.159 --> 00:25:48.720
they asked me, 'How do you solve your car
problem?' "By not having any car at all of

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.330
mine." They said, 'What about your house problem?"
"By having no house of my own."

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:54.639
"Nihi, Nihi." Everything Nihi for me. Then
how do you solve your this problem? By not

00:25:54.639 --> 00:26:01.639
having it, just have -- "No, not have it!"
Don't take up headaches upon yourself.

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:09.470
See when you take up headaches upon yourself
then only the innocence is reduced. That headaches

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:16.470
like this, that "This is my shawl, this is
my sari, this is my thing, this is this, this

00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:23.909
is this, this is this". But only one thing
is that "This is my Mother and I have to proclaim

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:32.690
Her", that's all.
If that is the way it is, then innocence starts

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:39.950
rising like Shri Ganesha, and by having no
other headache. "This is mine, that is mine."

00:26:42.679 --> 00:26:47.429
This 'mine' business causes the problem, I
think. Personally, I think this must be the

00:26:47.429 --> 00:26:52.009
reason. That this 'mine' business. 'This is
mine.' Because whatever is mine. Somebody

00:26:52.009 --> 00:26:57.869
told me, this is very good argument he gave,
"Whatever is mine is not I", means that is

00:26:57.869 --> 00:27:04.559
not Sahaja. My body, my head, my everything
-- 'my'. But 'I' He gave me this idea -- 'I'.

00:27:04.559 --> 00:27:11.559
What is 'I'? Then 'I' is separating, Whatever
is not mine is 'I'. So what remains is your

00:27:11.809 --> 00:27:16.450
Spirit. Somebody gave me this argument. I
said "Is a very good argument to work it out".

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:23.450
Then whatever remains is the 'I' and that
'I' is the one we have to see! So you go on

00:27:26.429 --> 00:27:31.419
reducing all these 'mines', 'mines', 'mines'.
So the pure spirit of innocence will rise.

00:27:31.419 --> 00:27:38.419
So the idea about Spirit also, people think
that if you become spiritual -- I mean, I

00:27:39.159 --> 00:27:45.100
don't know what people think about spiritual
people. But the idea about spiritual people

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:50.659
is that you have to be something terrific
like a bull or I don't know. You have to be

00:27:50.659 --> 00:27:57.659
sharp like a fox or you have to be intellectual
like Freud or something. All sorts of ideas

00:28:01.419 --> 00:28:08.419
people have. No, it is not! Spiritual person
is just innocent, just innocent. There is

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:16.359
no intelligence, nothing. Just innocent. The
whole thing is innocence. See, whatever he

00:28:16.359 --> 00:28:21.659
talks or says, comes through innocence. It
doesn't have intellect as such, which here

00:28:21.659 --> 00:28:25.249
people have through reading and through understanding
and by analysing. Nothing of the kind. It

00:28:25.249 --> 00:28:32.249
just has pure and simple innocence. And it
all works out very well. It is so clean. It

00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:43.279
just says what it knows and what it knows
is the highest.

00:28:45.379 --> 00:28:52.379
So this deconditioning has to be brought within
us. But you should not discuss it among yourselves

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:57.879
also. Once you start discussing then you also,
you see, it becomes sort of a theological

00:28:57.879 --> 00:29:04.879
argumentation. There is no theology about
it. It's very simple. It's the simplest thing

00:29:06.009 --> 00:29:13.009
is to be innocent. But the innocence is lost.
Why? Because our attention is in different

00:29:13.879 --> 00:29:20.299
way, we are attentive to other things. We
are looking at other things. It's so simple,

00:29:20.299 --> 00:29:24.970
you know. Today I was thinking I have to buy
three nine-yard saris. A simple question as

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:29.409
it is, because there were three ladies who
wear nine yard saris and I had to give them

00:29:29.409 --> 00:29:33.289
three nine yard saris. That is all. I just
thought of it. All right. I came here, I saw

00:29:33.289 --> 00:29:36.850
very nice saris being put here. So I asked
her, 'Where do you get?' She said 'You get

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:41.570
it here'. I said 'All right'. So you go and
buy these three saris. No analysis, nothing

00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:48.570
of the kind. It just came into my mind that
I have to buy three saris, finished! The answer

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:54.940
is here. So even the atmosphere is so innocent,
the whole situation is so innocent that the

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.369
solution is presented by innocence to innocence.
Innocence works out in everything, you see,

00:29:58.369 --> 00:30:03.559
because everybody has little bit of innocence
in every one, isn't it? So you can...it's

00:30:03.559 --> 00:30:10.559
like a fifth column, you see. The innocence
is a fifth column within you. So if any person

00:30:13.299 --> 00:30:17.889
is innocent, you see he'll work on your fifth
column and will make you all right. When you

00:30:17.889 --> 00:30:24.889
give bandhan to others, what happens, you
actually bind him by your innocence and the

00:30:28.429 --> 00:30:32.529
poor fellow doesn't know. He has his innocence
within him, you capture that innocence, that

00:30:32.529 --> 00:30:35.970
is all you have done, that's how you manage.
It's very simple to work out things. Only

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:42.970
principle, the tattwa, the whole thing rests
on what? Tattwa is nothing but innocence.

00:30:45.799 --> 00:30:51.259
So try to develop this by all these things...
"Ya neti, neti wachane nigamor awachus" By

00:30:51.259 --> 00:30:56.379
saying "Not this, not this, not this, not
this, not this," to all your thoughts. "Not

00:30:56.379 --> 00:31:03.379
this not this, not this, not this". You reach
there. 'Not mine, not mine, not mine, not

00:31:07.009 --> 00:31:13.210
mine". And that is how it is.
And you see the whole material world is now

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:20.210
attacking the innocence, because they are
frightened. You cannot attack it. Innocence

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:27.229
cannot be destroyed. It cannot be destroyed.
Innocence is something [which] is all pervading

00:31:27.229 --> 00:31:31.590
and it cannot be destroyed. So whatever people
may try, it cannot be destroyed. But it can

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:38.590
be covered, it can recede, but it cannot be
destroyed. It will act it's own way. So try

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:48.470
to develop that innocence which is the basis
of Mahalakshmi Tattwa, we should say, or that

00:31:49.109 --> 00:31:55.179
is essence of Mahalakshmi tattva.
So the outward things, the weightage, the

00:31:55.179 --> 00:31:59.519
weight, the dignity, the behaviour everything.
It is outward thing and the inside thing -- the

00:31:59.519 --> 00:32:03.960
tattwa, the principle, on which it is based
is innocence.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:09.619
Now if, with this, if we understand Mahalakshmi
tattwa within us, how it has to work out.

00:32:09.619 --> 00:32:16.609
It's not intellectual! Again I would say that
I don't want you to project your intellect

00:32:16.609 --> 00:32:22.330
into it, and to find out, but just remain
where you are and you will find the answers

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:28.940
just coming to you..automatically!
Just don't project your minds into it. Just

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:35.519
you'll get answers to every question, just
like that. Because innocence in everyone is

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:41.529
the simple answer where all the complications
drop out. The innocence is that. And that

00:32:41.529 --> 00:32:47.349
is what is the love of God, is the love of
God.

00:32:47.349 --> 00:32:53.269
So don't confuse this with love, with all
your nonsensical love ideas you have about

00:32:53.269 --> 00:33:00.269
people and identification, misidentification.
This is pure love within us, the purity, the

00:33:00.299 --> 00:33:07.299
innocence which is love and which is life
itself, we should say. It is a part of that,

00:33:08.479 --> 00:33:13.109
the Prana Shakti. But Prana Shakti is not
Mahalakshmi.

00:33:13.109 --> 00:33:20.109
So Mahalakshmi is the essence and essence
of everything, Because if creation has to

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:27.769
take place, also, if desire of God is there,
and if there is no Mahalakshmi tattwa, then

00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:33.159
what is the use of having desire?
Supposing, even if you have creation, and

00:33:33.159 --> 00:33:39.789
you do not have the Mahalakshmi tattwa, how
will you work it out? You cannot work it out,

00:33:39.789 --> 00:33:41.929
You have to have Mahalakshmi tattwa. Because
they do not have any meaning.

00:33:41.929 --> 00:33:48.840
So outwardly it is Mahalakshmi tattwa, but
inside, inside is, we can say, there are three

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:53.529
cores. The first core is Mahalakshmi tattwa,
outside to look at, you see the growth, all

00:33:53.529 --> 00:34:00.529
right. Then inside is the creation, that is
all the elements being created and all that.

00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:08.919
But inside that is the desire and inside the
desire is the half one, you can say, is the

00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:19.869
Ganesha. So this Ganesh tattwa ultimately
overpowers everything and permeates everything.

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:28.159
And this is, I would say that, don't think
about it. Just allow your innocence to grow,

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:37.290
Simple innocence.
And your dignity. That's very important to

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:44.290
have your dignity. Like some people think
if they wear torn clothes and walk about on

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:49.470
the street, and all they are big sanyasis.
It's wrong. Why? You are not being dignified

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:54.609
and God has given you so much, why should
you try to show that you haven't got anything?

00:34:54.609 --> 00:35:00.450
Just to show off that you haven't got anything
God has given. This is just a sort of thanks-giving

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:07.160
to God that, "God you have given me so much."
You have to wear the best. Like in Puja, if

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:13.170
you see, the ladies here wear all their nose
rings and all their ornaments and everything,

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:17.830
in the temple if they have to go. Everything
they wear! And in the same way, men also wear

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:22.160
their very clean dresses, very clean things,
whatever they have, they wear simple, clean

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:29.160
dresses, whatever they have. But no ostentation.
It is just a thing by which you express. The

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:36.940
God has given you this. 'O God! I thank you'.
It is such a great day today to be, in the

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:45.400
new year, on the new year day, to be here
on Mahalakshmi's place of Kolhapur. And this

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:52.400
is also called Kolhapur because Kolhasura
was killed here. Kolhasura was a horrible

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:02.060
fellow like a fox and he was born again. Now
he is again dead. Thank God!

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:07.550
He was here and now he's...Kolhasura died.
You don't think about it, again your mind

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:10.970
goes out. Don't think about it, I will tell
you about it. I have deliberately avoided

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:17.380
the name. He was born again and was pitched
out. So this is the place where Kolhasura

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:24.380
was killed, where this was established, so
Mahalakshmi incarnation came in and that is

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:30.460
how this place has a special value, that we
have come here for a pilgrimage and let us

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:37.460
be in a humble way. Think about it.
Actually these things could not take place

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:42.830
in the West because even if they had come
out of the Mother Earth who would have recognised

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:48.110
them? Who would have known about them? Who
would have respected them? Who would have

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:55.110
worshipped them? That is why it did not happen
in the West too much. But it is there, little

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:07.780
bit is there, no doubt. But here now we have
these, all these, temples and the attack on

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:14.780
the innocence has come from tantrikas. And
so the tantrikas entered all these temples

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:21.380
and they tried to establish themselves. But
gradually they are being neutralised and cleaned

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:27.290
out. These tantrikas have gone into every
temple of all the Goddesses. And they will

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:32.140
be gradually all out, straight out.
So this is the attack that came through and

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:39.140
that how these brahmins came down and settled
in these places. So-called brahmins. And tried

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:46.740
to preach about all tantrik methods and things
here, in the temple, and they really spoiled

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.050
the atmosphere here.
So may God bless you all.

00:37:55.050 --> 00:38:02.050
I want you people to develop concentration
of mind so that you rise above all other misidentifications

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:17.550
and get identified with the Pure Spirit, through
your Mahalakshmi principle.

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:20.150
May God bless you.
