[Music]

00:08.870 --> 00:11.870
chastity

00:16.300 --> 00:21.520
[Music]

00:21.700 --> 00:24.700
-

00:24.900 --> 00:28.830
just to

00:32.960 --> 00:42.870
[Music]

00:38.490 --> 00:42.870
today we have gathered here

00:46.580 --> 00:59.100
and very auspicious day to worship Shri

00:51.840 --> 01:04.530
Ganesha Shri Ganesha is the first deity

00:59.100 --> 01:10.220
that was created so that the whole

01:04.530 --> 01:20.900
universe is filled with auspiciousness

01:10.220 --> 01:20.900
with peace bliss and spirituality

01:25.539 --> 01:40.710
he is the source he's the source of

01:33.329 --> 01:45.810
spirituality as a result of that all

01:40.710 --> 01:51.429
other things follow like when he trains

01:45.810 --> 01:54.060
and his windy you feel the coolness in

01:51.429 --> 01:54.060
that misfile

01:55.079 --> 02:06.729
in the same way when Shri Ganesha emits

02:00.899 --> 02:12.519
his power we feel all these three things

02:06.729 --> 02:20.769
within and without I think I've told you

02:12.519 --> 02:23.950
a lot about Havel and his nature but

02:20.769 --> 02:28.900
still in so many of us have not yet

02:23.950 --> 02:31.230
realized what are his powers and what he

02:28.900 --> 02:31.230
wants

02:38.160 --> 02:47.250
first and foremost thing is that to

02:41.610 --> 02:51.660
respect Shri Ganesha is to understand

02:47.250 --> 02:56.190
the importance of chastity chastity is

02:51.660 --> 02:59.700
not only for the women it is more for

02:56.190 --> 03:04.170
the men to observe if you have

02:59.700 --> 03:07.320
self-respect in the real sense of the

03:04.170 --> 03:10.020
word you will take to translate ly

03:07.320 --> 03:15.930
without any difficulties because

03:10.020 --> 03:17.820
chastity is a very joy giving any joy it

03:15.930 --> 03:20.760
is not a thing that you have to tell

03:17.820 --> 03:27.450
somebody or to force somebody or to

03:20.760 --> 03:30.030
restrict somebody but it is to enjoy to

03:27.450 --> 03:33.630
enjoy yourself and enjoy the chastity of

03:30.030 --> 03:38.990
another person is such a great blessing

03:33.630 --> 03:42.480
of Shri Ganesha such a great blessing

03:38.990 --> 03:45.150
that you enjoy your chastity you are not

03:42.480 --> 03:48.570
bothered about the another person he is

03:45.150 --> 03:51.290
chased or not if he's doing bad things

03:48.570 --> 03:54.120
if he's a ruined person doesn't matter

03:51.290 --> 04:00.660
you don't get spoiled with that you have

03:54.120 --> 04:06.720
your own chastity your own life of very

04:00.660 --> 04:10.440
chaste moments it is nowadays such a

04:06.720 --> 04:14.610
modern style of thinking as a flowing

04:10.440 --> 04:18.359
towards unchaste life and all kinds of

04:14.610 --> 04:21.810
wrong ideas about chastity if somebody

04:18.359 --> 04:24.650
now talks of chastity people think this

04:21.810 --> 04:29.040
must be mad how can that be

04:24.650 --> 04:32.030
now to understand the significance of

04:29.040 --> 04:34.470
chastity within us we have to know that

04:32.030 --> 04:37.440
chastity is the foundation of all

04:34.470 --> 04:41.040
Dharma's unless and until you have sense

04:37.440 --> 04:42.690
of chastity you cannot have that Dharma

04:41.040 --> 04:45.930
is not possible because that's the

04:42.690 --> 04:49.470
foundation it will be a house of cards

04:45.930 --> 04:50.480
if you do not have the foundation of

04:49.470 --> 04:54.500
chastity

04:50.480 --> 04:57.260
it will just collapse in no time so is a

04:54.500 --> 04:58.700
very important thing is chastity which

04:57.260 --> 05:01.130
has been challenged in the West

04:58.700 --> 05:02.780
throughout and that's why I'm saying

05:01.130 --> 05:05.060
it's difficult to sow the seed of

05:02.780 --> 05:08.480
chastity in this country but that is a

05:05.060 --> 05:12.770
very important thing our whole morality

05:08.480 --> 05:15.140
depends on our idea of chastity we

05:12.770 --> 05:16.940
should be very chaste so many religions

05:15.140 --> 05:20.840
have come and they have talked about

05:16.940 --> 05:24.220
chastity but religions have become so

05:20.840 --> 05:32.660
useless now have become without any

05:24.220 --> 05:37.460
basis without any any proper execution

05:32.660 --> 05:39.650
of what is written for them they do all

05:37.460 --> 05:43.250
kinds of things and they call themselves

05:39.650 --> 05:45.590
Hindu Muslims Christians all kinds of

05:43.250 --> 05:48.130
religions actually the religions have

05:45.590 --> 05:53.330
failed completely

05:48.130 --> 05:57.680
people are sick now all over the Western

05:53.330 --> 06:02.620
life one feels they're sick sick because

05:57.680 --> 06:06.080
they have never recognized Shri Ganesha

06:02.620 --> 06:13.130
if one Freud came that doesn't mean that

06:06.080 --> 06:16.370
you should accept him but you did as if

06:13.130 --> 06:23.500
it was such an important thing to be

06:16.370 --> 06:28.030
done so today we are faced with our

06:23.500 --> 06:30.470
power of ascent and the power of

06:28.030 --> 06:32.690
conditionings we have had when Freud

06:30.470 --> 06:34.520
talked of conditioning he didn't know he

06:32.690 --> 06:38.470
was putting another type of horrid

06:34.520 --> 06:38.470
conditionings on terrible

06:43.939 --> 06:49.449
six is not important for human beings at

06:47.270 --> 06:49.449
all

06:49.539 --> 07:03.319
is not at all important and this

06:56.959 --> 07:09.679
civility one has to that it's so much

07:03.319 --> 07:16.039
surprising it comes from a very low

07:09.679 --> 07:24.740
Grady within us it comes from the low

07:16.039 --> 07:29.240
graded human beings that one becomes sir

07:24.740 --> 07:35.769
why to it you should be the master of

07:29.240 --> 07:39.019
that and today when I see around myself

07:35.769 --> 07:43.759
in the West which is also part and

07:39.019 --> 07:50.539
parcel of the same creation so much of

07:43.759 --> 07:56.809
sickness that has come I am really

07:50.539 --> 08:02.479
aghast how to turn your attention now to

07:56.809 --> 08:07.069
the maturity of sex when the sex matures

08:02.479 --> 08:14.119
you become a father a mother and the

08:07.069 --> 08:18.499
pure personality that doesn't mean I'm

08:14.119 --> 08:22.729
saying austerity at young age that

08:18.499 --> 08:26.899
doesn't mean that another absurdity is

08:22.729 --> 08:30.459
that but of course you must mature you

08:26.899 --> 08:30.459
need it the pasilla for that

08:31.870 --> 08:34.870
six

08:34.940 --> 08:44.240
the perversion has to be diverted

08:37.990 --> 08:46.699
towards your family your wife and you

08:44.240 --> 08:48.399
have to respect your chastity now the

08:46.699 --> 08:53.029
whole thing becomes nothing but just

08:48.399 --> 08:57.250
lead a chaste life not to be like a dog

08:53.029 --> 08:57.250
but like to be like a human

08:59.940 --> 09:05.370
all that attention has to become

09:02.070 --> 09:07.830
chastity which is your power which is

09:05.370 --> 09:16.560
your protection which is your connection

09:07.830 --> 09:22.760
with the divine not force Chestatee but

09:16.560 --> 09:26.760
a chastity of balance and understand

09:22.760 --> 09:31.620
with your family with your wife

09:26.760 --> 09:33.780
you're very chaste way we can live and

09:31.620 --> 09:37.250
the women are chase men also Avengers

09:33.780 --> 09:40.980
and this chastity is your main power

09:37.250 --> 09:44.640
this is just T is the one is the power

09:40.980 --> 09:45.560
of Shri Ganesha and when you get HT the

09:44.640 --> 09:50.250
nature's power

09:45.560 --> 09:53.320
you know how powerful you become the

09:50.250 --> 09:56.690
innocence that is submitted

09:53.320 --> 10:03.950
without the chastity that women cannot

09:56.690 --> 10:08.150
achieve anything one has to give up all

10:03.950 --> 10:10.640
the pasta all the pasta and also the way

10:08.150 --> 10:13.570
there is compartment from the newspapers

10:10.640 --> 10:16.580
from the media from everything

10:13.570 --> 10:20.480
recently I read a beautiful so because

10:16.580 --> 10:25.150
that has come up that media forces

10:20.480 --> 10:28.940
haven't in that they have said and how

10:25.150 --> 10:31.750
this media has put ideas into the heads

10:28.940 --> 10:31.750
of women

10:42.420 --> 10:52.259
married divorced married and divorce now

10:47.839 --> 10:56.369
what I gather that Western society is

10:52.259 --> 11:01.199
built up against marriages against

10:56.369 --> 11:08.759
families to be married according to them

11:01.199 --> 11:10.049
it's a sin and once you are married to

11:08.759 --> 11:13.709
get out of the scene you must do

11:10.049 --> 11:16.439
something like that because they live

11:13.709 --> 11:19.970
together for days together and once they

11:16.439 --> 11:19.970
marry immediately they think of divorce

11:20.989 --> 11:26.040
because marriage is now so much

11:23.429 --> 11:30.239
connected with property money is that

11:26.040 --> 11:32.309
nonsense but the whole thing has become

11:30.239 --> 11:35.489
so gross and after marriage there is no

11:32.309 --> 11:37.949
question of love because how much money

11:35.489 --> 11:39.749
goes how much part of the house goes how

11:37.949 --> 11:42.619
many things are mine in harmony the

11:39.749 --> 11:47.119
whole thing have become so materialistic

11:42.619 --> 11:47.119
such marriages can never be successful

11:49.939 --> 11:55.379
but in sahaja yoga we marry for our

11:53.309 --> 11:58.110
ascent and we have to respect our

11:55.379 --> 12:02.309
marriages and to respect our chests it

11:58.110 --> 12:08.040
is with our brothers and sisters those

12:02.309 --> 12:12.509
people who try to somehow other way in

12:08.040 --> 12:18.410
the purity of connectivity I assure you

12:12.509 --> 12:22.559
will be in very very trouble hence both

12:18.410 --> 12:25.110
so please do your soul-searching find

12:22.559 --> 12:29.999
out if there are any impure feelings try

12:25.110 --> 12:34.459
to throw the moment and know that you

12:29.999 --> 12:34.459
are not possessed by such funny ideas

12:35.720 --> 12:43.110
if you start developing a deeper

12:38.760 --> 12:49.890
understanding then we will not be

12:43.110 --> 12:56.160
attracted by superficial things and you

12:49.890 --> 12:58.950
won't be distracted from your path after

12:56.160 --> 13:02.010
getting realization you should be

12:58.950 --> 13:04.440
absolutely chaste people you shouldn't

13:02.010 --> 13:09.570
have your eyes roving around everywhere

13:04.440 --> 13:13.230
and sort of what you can call a very bad

13:09.570 --> 13:17.450
method of communicating with young women

13:13.230 --> 13:21.660
and young men and spoiling your chastity

13:17.450 --> 13:24.570
even your eyes should be clean even your

13:21.660 --> 13:27.210
thoughts should be green for that you

13:24.570 --> 13:29.279
should introspect and see for yourself

13:27.210 --> 13:35.760
what mistakes were made

13:29.279 --> 13:42.180
committing and what kind of an unchaste

13:35.760 --> 13:47.820
behavior you have and the negative

13:42.180 --> 13:55.320
within us disappears the light of Shri

13:47.820 --> 13:59.550
Ganesha you can see it so clearly in

13:55.320 --> 14:01.740
another person if you don't have

13:59.550 --> 14:04.520
chastity you can never see who is

14:01.740 --> 14:06.600
unchaste or just you cannot

14:04.520 --> 14:08.339
everybody is just the same very good

14:06.600 --> 14:14.520
very good very nice person when I

14:08.339 --> 14:18.870
suppose I were a real possessed people

14:14.520 --> 14:21.810
are certified as very good people in

14:18.870 --> 14:25.520
sahaja yoga also sometimes and I start

14:21.810 --> 14:28.290
wondering what's happening what is it

14:25.520 --> 14:35.610
how is it these people are certified as

14:28.290 --> 14:40.839
that can't you feel it there's no light

14:35.610 --> 14:43.199
even if you get your realization even if

14:40.839 --> 14:45.999
your spirit is working out your

14:43.199 --> 14:49.779
collective consciousness even if you are

14:45.999 --> 14:53.399
giving self-realization to others you

14:49.779 --> 14:53.399
are nowhere if you have no chastity

14:57.029 --> 15:01.179
that's like a broken glass which is

14:59.439 --> 15:06.179
trying to reflect something it can never

15:01.179 --> 15:09.429
give the right picture it's so important

15:06.179 --> 15:12.129
and I have to tell you this now the time

15:09.429 --> 15:18.939
has come for me to tell you this is the

15:12.129 --> 15:21.009
snag in our life first thing people will

15:18.939 --> 15:27.939
ask whom am I going to marry what is a

15:21.009 --> 15:29.679
Johari of course marriage I call it an

15:27.939 --> 15:31.300
auspicious thing marriage should be

15:29.679 --> 15:35.679
there there should be a collective

15:31.300 --> 15:39.100
sanction everything but for what to

15:35.679 --> 15:41.649
adorn the chastity within us now

15:39.100 --> 15:47.679
supposing you are worshiping today Shri

15:41.649 --> 15:50.040
Ganesha so why are you worshipping Shri

15:47.679 --> 15:50.040
Ganesha

15:51.570 --> 15:58.140
you're worshipping because your Ganesha

15:55.050 --> 16:02.550
must be awakened that you should have

15:58.140 --> 16:07.670
the qualities of Shri Ganesha that you

16:02.550 --> 16:07.670
should feel that innocence in your eyes

16:08.870 --> 16:13.590
otherwise you are a hypocrite if you are

16:11.850 --> 16:16.860
sitting here in worshipping Shri Ganesha

16:13.590 --> 16:24.560
and you are not trying to put your

16:16.860 --> 16:24.560
attention to your ascent as the Ganesh

16:25.730 --> 16:41.520
then it is useless the magnet within you

16:36.180 --> 16:44.490
is Shri Ganesha many people know that I

16:41.520 --> 16:46.050
have a great sense of direction that

16:44.490 --> 16:49.680
comes through this magnet which is

16:46.050 --> 16:56.250
perfect this magnet is the one which

16:49.680 --> 16:57.440
keeps you sticking or existed or all the

16:56.250 --> 17:03.570
time

16:57.440 --> 17:06.690
pointed toward spirit if you don't have

17:03.570 --> 17:09.480
the sense of chastity you will dangle

17:06.690 --> 17:10.829
this way that way suddenly you become a

17:09.480 --> 17:14.730
very good sahaja yogi tomorrow you

17:10.829 --> 17:26.250
become a devil because there's nothing

17:14.730 --> 17:31.500
that keeps you binding to the great idea

17:26.250 --> 17:33.780
of the spirit let us face it up now the

17:31.500 --> 17:38.040
time has come for all of us all the

17:33.780 --> 17:42.740
sahaja Yogi's that the greatest thing

17:38.040 --> 17:42.740
within us is not sex but his chest

17:46.440 --> 17:51.600
once you understand the importance that

17:49.110 --> 17:54.030
sahaja yoga you can only achieve your

17:51.600 --> 17:58.290
ascent through purity there's no other

17:54.030 --> 18:00.230
way anything which is hanging on to you

17:58.290 --> 18:03.900
will keep you down

18:00.230 --> 18:07.670
and whatever you go start dropping it

18:03.900 --> 18:11.340
out whether it is ego super-ego anything

18:07.670 --> 18:15.120
but the highest of all is the purity of

18:11.340 --> 18:22.560
your mind as far as the sex is concerned

18:15.120 --> 18:26.970
I will give it the highest birth that's

18:22.560 --> 18:29.700
what we call as innocence that's the

18:26.970 --> 18:34.830
only thing that will think you are head

18:29.700 --> 18:39.560
and so we all should try to search our

18:34.830 --> 18:42.990
suppose you have got of course

18:39.560 --> 18:45.600
realization you have got great qualities

18:42.990 --> 18:48.630
you are not even aware as to what you

18:45.600 --> 18:50.700
want through easy but the knowledge also

18:48.630 --> 18:53.400
so easily didn't have to go to any

18:50.700 --> 18:58.710
college or anything and you are capable

18:53.400 --> 19:01.770
of so many things but remember that the

18:58.710 --> 19:06.450
power that is within you is cleverer

19:01.770 --> 19:08.940
than you and anything you try to do

19:06.450 --> 19:12.510
which is not correct which is not

19:08.940 --> 19:14.990
righteous which is not holy it will try

19:12.510 --> 19:14.990
to bear it

19:17.120 --> 19:32.920
so try to be a different person try to

19:22.010 --> 19:35.810
understand what is behind this person

19:32.920 --> 19:44.170
what is the spiritual quality of this

19:35.810 --> 19:49.010
person and then only you will know that

19:44.170 --> 19:55.700
pure relationships are so fragrant and

19:49.010 --> 19:57.710
so beautiful I really enjoy you people

19:55.700 --> 20:02.110
because you have such pure relationships

19:57.710 --> 20:02.110
of know yourself I have such understand

20:04.690 --> 20:09.810
somewhat

20:06.590 --> 20:09.810
