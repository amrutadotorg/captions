00:00:05.782 --> 00:00:13.039
We started with various types of practices

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:20.022
of Ashtanga Yogas, eightfold yogas,
with a guru

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.760
and one had to go through lots
of hardships.

00:00:29.515 --> 00:00:37.925
Nobody who was married, was allowed
into that Ashtanga yoga and they had to

00:00:39.363 --> 00:00:44.979
give up their families, give up
their relationships.

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.867
They had to become absolutely
[ASIDE - Just a minute] -

00:00:53.222 --> 00:00:59.654
absolutely without any attachments
to go to a guru.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.738
All their property, all their possessions 
were given up -

00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:19.687
not to the guru, as is done in
modern times, but given away -

00:01:21.153 --> 00:01:23.422
and this was called as Yoga.

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:34.363
The another style was called as Sankhya.
Sankhya is where

00:01:37.973 --> 00:01:44.178
all your life you have to gather
things with detachment

00:01:46.892 --> 00:01:51.304
and then to distribute them completely

00:01:55.574 --> 00:02:06.456
and take to a guru, in a way completely
surrender, and then get realization.

00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:18.836
Sankhya is the right sided - sorry -
Sankhya was the left-sided behavior

00:02:21.234 --> 00:02:32.969
and the yoga was the right-sided where the
Gayatri mantra was used was the Sankhya.

00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:43.654
Because they were left-sided, 
they used to use Gayatri mantra.

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:53.914
They went so much to the left side, that
is to gather things, to gather possessions,

00:02:53.914 --> 00:03:03.859
to gather properties, to gather all kinds
of friends and relations and societies,

00:03:04.711 --> 00:03:10.674
that they were afraid that they may be
completely lost into all those things.

00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:23.829
They would go to Gayatri, the mantra
of Gayatri, which teaches you the

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.658
essences of all our chakras, the centres.

00:03:29.938 --> 00:03:37.677
So the people who did Sankhya were sort of
not so much respected as spiritual people

00:03:37.936 --> 00:03:42.919
because they thought these are all involved
into worldly things and worldly possessions

00:03:43.196 --> 00:03:50.714
and worldly happenings, so they were
regarded as something secondary.

00:03:51.247 --> 00:04:03.142
Or those who were yogis of the gurus were
regarded higher because they had already

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:09.805
given up everything and they have gone to a
guru, giving up all the things that they have.

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:19.360
But here, these gurus had a problem
within themselves

00:04:20.781 --> 00:04:27.021
because they found that those who
came to them gave up everything no doubt,

00:04:27.021 --> 00:04:34.329
but still there was lurking attachments.
In their own ashramas they found

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:41.548
these people had their own attachments to
things. Though outwardly they had given up

00:04:41.548 --> 00:04:47.676
but inside they had not given up. So they
were still sticking on to these ideas

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:55.947
that, uh, "Oh it's alright but still we
can have little things like that,

00:04:56.297 --> 00:05:01.688
doesn't matter," like that, there was
little compromises going on.

00:05:03.758 --> 00:05:06.920
Like as we have here nunneries
and all that.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.424
So both, in a way, were artificial.

00:05:15.744 --> 00:05:22.824
The one side is the Sankhyas, were trying to
ascend with all the luggage they were carrying

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:32.919
and another were trying to descend
with all the ambitions of ascend.

00:05:35.558 --> 00:05:48.629
So it was a very funny thing in every 
aspect, in both these styles of yoga.
