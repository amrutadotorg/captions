00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:13,325
PRACTICAL UNDERSTANDING OF COLLECTIVITY

2
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,634
1. MEANING OF COLLECTIVITY

3
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,225
Collectivity doesn’t mean that we all
should be stuck together

4
00:00:28,426 --> 00:00:35,216
with some glue or something or we all
become like Gibraltar,

5
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,868
Rock of Gibraltar. No, it doesn’t mean
that.

6
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:46,138
 It means wherever you are, you are
connected. That is collectivity.

7
00:00:46,748 --> 00:00:50,648
But if you are not connected and you are
just glued together,

8
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:56,785
it’s very inconvenient to live under such
circumstances.

9
00:00:56,986 --> 00:01:02,471
I think, people don’t even understand
the meaning of collectivity

10
00:01:02,672 --> 00:01:09,547
where there’s not the other, Ananya. Where
there’s not the other,

11
00:01:09,748 --> 00:01:13,513
there’s no other personality.

12
00:01:14,964 --> 00:01:23,570
These personalities are separated from you
because of left and right.

13
00:01:23,771 --> 00:01:27,044
Or could be both.

14
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:35,634
But you are yourself fully when you are
absolutely detached

15
00:01:35,835 --> 00:01:43,886
and your Kundalini is dancing – you’re
alone and never alone.

16
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:54,329
This oneness with the whole

17
00:01:54,530 --> 00:02:02,964
gives you all the security that you want,
all the joy you want.

18
00:02:04,217 --> 00:02:11,778
And that’s why Kundalini Awakening means
"collectivity".

19
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:21,964
Unless and until you want pure collectivity
in your being, Kundalini won’t rise.

20
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:28,849
2. ONE BIG FAMILY

21
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:41,788
So now, let us see how do we miss out
on collectivity.

22
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:50,063
There’s a very practical down-to-earth
understanding.

23
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:56,232
First we must know without collectivity we
cannot exist.

24
00:02:56,433 --> 00:03:02,062
As the body has to be in connection with
the brain,

25
00:03:02,263 --> 00:03:08,710
in the same way, without collectivity
Sahaja Yoga cannot exist.

26
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,609
Once you understand that, then you have
to work it out

27
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:21,513
that collectivity is absolutely
established, within and without.

28
00:03:21,714 --> 00:03:29,754
I do not know what thing comes first
in the human mind about another person,

29
00:03:29,955 --> 00:03:36,139
but the first thing is that these are your
real relations

30
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,186
and nobody else are your relations.

31
00:03:42,387 --> 00:03:46,634
These children are your children

32
00:03:46,835 --> 00:03:52,236
and these men are your brothers, and these
ladies are your sisters,

33
00:03:52,437 --> 00:03:56,961
and we are one big family together.

34
00:03:58,873 --> 00:04:03,045
We are part and parcel of one body,

35
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:09,371
and this hand cannot hit another hand,
thank God it doesn’t think,

36
00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:14,976
otherwise as human beings they might start
thinking against another hand,

37
00:04:15,177 --> 00:04:20,772
but they don’t because they are connected
to one brain activity.

38
00:04:22,672 --> 00:04:27,445
3. PURE RELATIONSHIPS

39
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:36,955
So, we can see that when we ascend
in the collective consciousness

40
00:04:37,156 --> 00:04:42,316
and we have collective living, collective
meeting,

41
00:04:44,329 --> 00:04:52,167
at the Vishuddhi Chakra Shri Krishna
established this, or He manifested

42
00:04:52,368 --> 00:04:57,184
this pure relationship of a sister.

43
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:06,646
In a collective life that we have,

44
00:05:08,953 --> 00:05:14,709
in the Ashram where we live, where we move
about as Sahaja Yogis,

45
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:20,867
if we do not have this basic principle
within us,

46
00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:26,299
there will be a chaos, complete chaos.

47
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:32,491
Once this purity of relationship is
established,

48
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:39,215
that apart from my wife, all the rest are
my sisters or mothers,

49
00:05:43,948 --> 00:05:47,100
it cannot be

50
00:05:51,550 --> 00:06:02,885
a proper society and the chaos
of the social system of America

51
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:09,666
is because they have no sense of pure
relationships.

52
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:14,834
Once you call somebody a sister, she is
the sister.

53
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,779
 And once you call somebody a brother,
she is (he is) a brother.

54
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,029
It's not only that you should be born
of the same parents, it's not necessary,

55
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:30,389
but this is a very important principle

56
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:37,725
to have a very pure society where everybody
can live peacefully.

57
00:06:39,968 --> 00:06:44,929
4. TURMOIL AND PEACE

58
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:54,184
Think of the tree which is, say,
in a turmoil or during earthquake:

59
00:06:54,385 --> 00:06:59,604
it won’t grow. When the earthquake stops,

60
00:06:59,805 --> 00:07:05,829
everything becomes quiet, everything is
peaceful, then only the tree can grow.

61
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:12,449
In the same way, our growth can only take
place if we are peaceful within ourselves.

62
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:20,433
So for a Kundalini growing wider and wider
and rising higher and higher,

63
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:25,892
first thing is we must have peace within
ourselves.

64
00:07:26,093 --> 00:07:31,371
But this peace is possible if you can make
really peace with others.

65
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:36,624
If you cannot make peace with others who
are in Sahaja Yoga,

66
00:07:36,825 --> 00:07:43,432
who are in the collective, if you are in
a turmoil, this Kundalini can never rise.

67
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:47,606
That is why collectivity is so important.

68
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:52,014
Without collectivity your Vishuddhi cannot
open,

69
00:07:52,215 --> 00:08:00,509
and without collectivity you cannot have
the growth of your spirituality.

70
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:07,003
It’s the growth of the spirituality: as
they say, the Tree of Life is upside-down

71
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:16,128
and the roots are in the brain, and this
Kundalini has to go and water that brain,

72
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:21,644
as we water the roots. Then it starts
flowing downward,

73
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:24,986
and that’s how you start expanding.

74
00:08:26,904 --> 00:08:32,148
5. COMPASSION AND LOVE

75
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:36,557
Now Mother has said we have to have
compassion, well now where do we

76
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:41,095
have our compassion, on the walls? Where
do we use our compassion?

77
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:44,389
Where do we use our compassion?

78
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,985
So Sahaja Yoga is to be practiced, doesn’t
mean that you sit down

79
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:51,811
with My photograph all the time, doesn’t
mean that.

80
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:59,448
It means you practice compassion; you
practice that.

81
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:06,182
Then you have to practice love. Now how do
you practice love with others?

82
00:09:06,383 --> 00:09:12,941
If you love someone, what do you do? You
try to please that person.

83
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:16,705
Small things can make people very happy.

84
00:09:16,906 --> 00:09:20,284
I know, you all try to please Me very much,
you’ll give Me presents,

85
00:09:20,485 --> 00:09:22,774
you’ll find out things which are good
for Me,

86
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:25,804
you’ll go out of the way buy sweet flowers
for Me,

87
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:31,446
beautiful things you do to please Me.
I am over-pleased, I must tell you.

88
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,661
But I am more pleased, much more pleased

89
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:40,622
if you understand collectivity and try
to please each other.

90
00:09:40,845 --> 00:09:46,376
So now the practice love, where do you
practice? Ask you a question:

91
00:09:46,577 --> 00:09:52,441
where do I practice love? What do I love?

92
00:09:52,642 --> 00:09:58,891
We live, love our house, we love our
photographs, our decorations, everything,

93
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:09,177
but do I practice this love on my wife, or
on my husband, or on other Sahaja yogis?

94
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:16,386
6. DEVELOPMENT OF PATIENCE

95
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:25,841
In our Sahaj culture we have to practice
compassion and love,

96
00:10:28,142 --> 00:10:32,384
and thirdly we have to practice patience.

97
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:39,075
I know some children are maybe little more
mischievous, some are less mischievous.

98
00:10:39,276 --> 00:10:45,251
Maybe some people are very talkative,
sometimes really they give Me also headache;

99
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:49,295
they go on talking, talking, talking,
talking, so much!

100
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:55,046
Sometimes I think it’s good because it’s
a rest for My mouth –

101
00:10:55,927 --> 00:11:00,047
one way of looking at it. Another way of
looking at it is just switch off your mind,

102
00:11:00,248 --> 00:11:04,549
let him talk, take it out whatever he wants
to talk.

103
00:11:04,824 --> 00:11:11,535
Once he is finished with it and fagged out
then he won’t bother you much

104
00:11:11,736 --> 00:11:16,773
and also he’ll feel satisfied that somebody
has listened to his prattles.

105
00:11:16,974 --> 00:11:23,368
So patience is needed and patience is
needed in such a way

106
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:26,443
that others should see your patience.

107
00:11:26,693 --> 00:11:29,822
Yesterday for example, I was sitting
for about, I think, three hours

108
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:37,165
shaking hands with all sorts of people
and all types of problems,

109
00:11:37,366 --> 00:11:40,143
and the person who came last, he said,

110
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:45,605
“Looking at Your patience, I develop my own
patience.”

111
00:11:47,868 --> 00:11:55,716
And love gives you patience. This love
nourishes you.

112
00:11:55,917 --> 00:12:00,546
I’m telling you, it’s absolutely
down-to-earth method:

113
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:06,270
here I’ve not mentioned that you trust God,
I’m just saying trust yourself,

114
00:12:06,471 --> 00:12:11,078
absolutely down-to-earth because we are
talking about your brain.

115
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:18,025
7. EXPLOITATION AND RESPECT

116
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:29,782
So, today's understanding should be that we
all should become collective from inside.

117
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:38,210
We should not grudge or grumble about
everything and enjoy the collectivity.

118
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:44,036
But the second side of collectivity is
this, that do not try

119
00:12:44,237 --> 00:12:48,760
to exploit the collectivity, otherwise,
you'll be in trouble.

120
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:52,762
Like, I've seen some people don't know how
to use their bathrooms.

121
00:12:52,963 --> 00:13:02,992
When you are collective you have to be
respecting the collectivity of others.

122
00:13:03,911 --> 00:13:11,007
 By your presence another person should
not, by any chance, suffer,

123
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:24,322
or should not feel in any way insulted
or inconvenienced.

124
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:28,463
So when you are in the collective it should
be such that

125
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:36,027
another person should enjoy your company,
enjoy your being there.

126
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:43,499
That is something where there is
no problem.

127
00:13:46,872 --> 00:13:50,156
But if you are demanding, and if you are
asking for things

128
00:13:50,357 --> 00:13:55,108
and you think no end of yourself, you
cannot at all collective, by any chance,

129
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:58,815
but you'll suffer for that,

130
00:14:00,594 --> 00:14:04,362
automatically you will suffer.

131
00:14:05,252 --> 00:14:12,396
If this is realized and understood
properly, your Agnya is solved.

132
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:19,490
8. ANGER AND FORGIVENESS

133
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:25,775
Like anger.

134
00:14:28,398 --> 00:14:34,892
There are people always boast, "I'm very
angry with him." Boast.

135
00:14:36,852 --> 00:14:43,164
But just make that anger into forgiveness
and you'll see the person,

136
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:48,814
instead of you getting into problems,
he will get into problems.

137
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:57,730
Anger will upset you, but forgiveness will
upset him, automatically.

138
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:02,317
It's the biggest weapon you have got –
is to forgive.

139
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:07,281
And this is shown in Buddha's character
throughout.

140
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:13,967
Now we have been saying that we have
to forgive everyone,

141
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:21,446
but we don’t practice that. Small, small
things like mad people we remember.

142
00:15:21,647 --> 00:15:25,108
I mean, only I have heard that snake has
this capacity

143
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:27,561
to remember if somebody has hurt him,

144
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:31,496
but here I find human beings have no less
capacity.

145
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:34,664
Whatever has happened 13 years back,
15 years back

146
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:38,181
they all remember each and every thing:
whatever has hurt them,

147
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:42,200
but how they have hurt others they don’t
remember,

148
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:45,883
how they have been nasty to others they
don’t remember,

149
00:15:46,084 --> 00:15:51,496
because this is a human mind which has got
the ego,

150
00:15:51,697 --> 00:15:57,225
it can go on hurting others, it doesn’t
feel anything, and the superego

151
00:15:57,426 --> 00:16:02,746
which goes on receiving all the hurts and
always complaining about it.

152
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:09,442
9. CRITICISM AND BUMPTIOUSNESS

153
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:18,040
Don’t criticize the collectivity, till I
Myself find it out and I’ll put it right.

154
00:16:18,241 --> 00:16:23,909
Keep to the collectivity wisely and
earnestly,

155
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:29,561
and try to keep the collectivity together.

156
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:35,701
Try to help to keep the people collective,
to enjoy together.

157
00:16:35,902 --> 00:16:39,335
Don’t criticize each other.

158
00:16:39,536 --> 00:16:44,033
Only criticize yourself if you are
in the habit of criticism,

159
00:16:44,234 --> 00:16:49,533
better criticize yourself, it’s better;
because these are habits also.

160
00:16:49,734 --> 00:16:54,386
People, specially I have seen people
in the West, they react to everything.

161
00:16:54,587 --> 00:16:57,577
If they see this carpet, “Oh, I don’t
like it.”

162
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:01,135
But this is not yours, you’ve not paid for
you, what have you got to do with it?

163
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:05,354
“No, I don’t like it.” But it’s not yours;

164
00:17:05,555 --> 00:17:09,866
what’s the question? It’s lying here, why
should you be so upset about it?

165
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:15,334
“I don’t like that person. I don’t like
that dress.”

166
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:18,569
Who are you?

167
00:17:19,253 --> 00:17:22,229
“I don’t like.”

168
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:29,370
This is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga,
“I don’t like.”

169
00:17:30,404 --> 00:17:40,019
There is a way of saying things; but there
is no need to say anything whatsoever.

170
00:17:44,383 --> 00:17:51,995
So all this kind of bumptiousness and
showing off is against collectivity.

171
00:17:53,979 --> 00:17:58,955
10. JEALOUSY AND APPRECIATION

172
00:18:00,865 --> 00:18:08,247
So try to appreciate everything. Children
are producing pictures, paintings, any way.

173
00:18:08,448 --> 00:18:13,003
They make sometimes My face is very funny
when they draw –

174
00:18:13,204 --> 00:18:17,629
not the children, even grownups. Doesn’t
matter, I appreciate it, it’s very good,

175
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,303
wonderful, very nice, to encourage that
person.

176
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:30,206
So criticism should go out of our mind,
but appreciation should be practiced:

177
00:18:30,407 --> 00:18:36,036
appreciation of others’ children,
appreciation of other people

178
00:18:36,237 --> 00:18:41,140
is very important but that doesn’t mean
that you appreciate all others

179
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:47,852
and torture your wife or torture your
husband – that also is an imbalance.

180
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:53,878
First responsibility is your family but you
should appreciate others,

181
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:59,073
and this comes when you have no jealousies
about anyone.

182
00:18:59,274 --> 00:19:01,538
This jealousy, I don’t know from where
it comes,

183
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:07,045
so I don’t know this quality of jealousy,
why there is jealousy.

184
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:12,615
So, also if you have jealousy you have
to use it for the right purpose,

185
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:16,616
and what is the right purpose is that you
should be jealous of a person

186
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:22,335
who is spiritually higher than you, and you
practice it that you become better.

187
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:26,807
If jealousy is for competition, then you
compete with the person

188
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:36,250
who is more compassionate, more loving,
more sacrificing, more patient.

189
00:19:38,127 --> 00:19:41,598
So this competition becomes a very healthy
competition

190
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:46,175
and the collectivity becomes very
nourished.

191
00:19:48,176 --> 00:19:53,214
11. AGGRESSIVENESS AND HIMULITY

192
00:19:54,986 --> 00:20:00,145
Now the worst enemy of collectivity is
aggressiveness.

193
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:06,220
Some people are basically aggressive; their
style of talking is extremely aggressive,

194
00:20:06,421 --> 00:20:10,763
the way they say things is aggressive.
May be because anything,

195
00:20:10,964 --> 00:20:17,999
may be they are better educated, may be
they come from a very aggressive family,

196
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,444
may be they are having a kind
of a superiority complex

197
00:20:23,645 --> 00:20:30,865
or an inferiority complex or a sense
of insecurity, or maybe they are possessed.

198
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:38,803
They try to dominate and show their very
strong feelings towards people –

199
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:45,526
of superiority. They may be inferior, it’s
not necessary,

200
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:51,006
but they do and this is something is to be
curbed.

201
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:58,213
So what you have to practice here is
humility. Try to be humble.

202
00:20:59,315 --> 00:21:05,415
Humility is that in no way you try
to aggress others,

203
00:21:05,616 --> 00:21:11,887
and if others are aggressive you accept it
 as a childish thing, as a stupid thing,

204
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:20,169
as a foolish thing, has no meaning: because
you are so powerful, you can bear it.

205
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:28,360
That is humility which you have to practice
and all these qualities if you have,

206
00:21:29,638 --> 00:21:35,892
you will really be surprised that you will
lose your selfishness.

207
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:42,447
12. COLLECTIVE TEMPERAMENT

208
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:49,618
Only way to grow is to be collective.
There’s no other way out.

209
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:53,719
If people think that by staying away
from ashrams,

210
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,351
alone living somewhere they will achieve
much

211
00:21:57,552 --> 00:22:02,264
- that’s not the way Sahaja Yoga is meant.

212
00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:09,806
Formerly, people used to go to Himalayas
and most of them were separated

213
00:22:10,007 --> 00:22:16,211
and only one or two persons were chosen
for spiritual growth.

214
00:22:16,412 --> 00:22:19,664
Here it is not question of spiritual
growth,

215
00:22:19,865 --> 00:22:26,021
 it’s a question of your collectivity
growing in you.

216
00:22:26,226 --> 00:22:33,748
That is how you become a person who is
collective, who enjoys collective,

217
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:38,599
who works on collective and lives
with collective.

218
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:47,372
Such a person develops new kind of powers.

219
00:22:49,305 --> 00:22:55,466
And these powers are such that they are
very subtle,

220
00:22:55,667 --> 00:23:06,262
but they penetrate into any molecule, atom
or human beings, anywhere.

221
00:23:06,463 --> 00:23:10,525
And their penetration is only possible if
you have

222
00:23:10,726 --> 00:23:14,214
a temperament which is collective.

223
00:23:14,415 --> 00:23:21,531
Without being fully collective, you cannot
achieve

224
00:23:22,293 --> 00:23:27,882
that height which is very necessary today
for Sahaja Yoga.

225
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:35,515
13. INDIVIDUALISM AND INTEGRATION

226
00:23:37,175 --> 00:23:46,464
Question: “Shri Mother, we feel the same
chakras, more on legs than on the fingers.”

227
00:23:46,665 --> 00:23:52,102
Shri Mataji: The integration is not there,
that’s why. You have to attend collectively.

228
00:23:52,303 --> 00:23:56,012
You have to become more collective.
The body has to be collective.

229
00:23:56,213 --> 00:24:00,090
The thing is if you don't, if you are not
a collective person then sometimes

230
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:03,418
you’ll feel them on the legs, sometimes
on the hand, sometimes in the head.

231
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:06,639
That’s not a good thing. You should try
to become more collective,

232
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:12,992
you should meet more people, take more
interest. You see, the body of your’s

233
00:24:13,193 --> 00:24:21,179
won't work out efficiently unless and
until you use it.

234
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:27,075
Because individually, you see if they,
individually if you work out,

235
00:24:27,276 --> 00:24:33,666
it will not develop collectively, because
where are you using it?

236
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:38,462
You are correcting yourself to give it
to others. And if you don’t give it,

237
00:24:38,663 --> 00:24:45,511
if you do not work it out in a collective
way, there is no circulation.

238
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:52,288
14. COLLECTIVE MEDITATION

239
00:24:53,896 --> 00:25:00,381
Meditating together is the best way to feel
the collectivity.

240
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,904
You can meditate at home, of course, you
also cleanse it for your depth,

241
00:25:04,105 --> 00:25:07,910
but also you must meditate together and
when you meditate together

242
00:25:08,111 --> 00:25:13,596
then the strength that you have strengthens
others,

243
00:25:13,797 --> 00:25:18,059
and the strength of the whole collectivity
improves so much.

244
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,721
We are meditating together is a very big
thing.

245
00:25:21,922 --> 00:25:26,331
Everyone has to understand that whenever
you get time you find out

246
00:25:26,532 --> 00:25:30,935
in the morning times, for example, we’ll go
to the ashram and meditate.

247
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:34,404
Say, Sunday morning, we’ll just go and
meditate in the ashram.

248
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:38,014
Just for meditation you have to come.
Meditate and go away

249
00:25:38,215 --> 00:25:41,996
because I reside in this ashram, I am here,

250
00:25:42,197 --> 00:25:45,928
so leave your homes, come here and
meditate.

251
00:25:46,113 --> 00:25:51,794
Meditation will help you a lot. Wherever
you are together, I am with you

252
00:25:51,995 --> 00:25:56,987
but when you are away from each other,
I am not with you.

253
00:25:57,438 --> 00:26:02,302
Only in difficulties, when you are pushed
into some places where I am not there,

254
00:26:02,503 --> 00:26:06,241
where you think I am not there, I am there.

255
00:26:06,449 --> 00:26:12,537
But if you deliberately are keeping out
of collectivity, I am not with you,

256
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:19,748
so try to grow your collectivity otherwise
you cannot go deep into your own depths,

257
00:26:19,949 --> 00:26:26,208
you cannot become a great Sahaja yogi,
you cannot really be called a Sahaja yogi.

258
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:31,566
Those who have a sense of collectivity can
only become that.

259
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:38,302
15. EGO AND SURRENDERING

260
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:46,700
"Sangham sharanam gacchami." Sangha means
collectivity,

261
00:26:46,901 --> 00:26:52,571
I surrender myself to the collectivity.

262
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:57,040
So here, in complete awareness, I mean,
you cannot be mesmerized.

263
00:26:57,241 --> 00:27:01,266
If you are mesmerized then you can live
whatever way you like.

264
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:09,514
But in complete awareness and full
understanding we have to become collective.

265
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:16,691
But once you are without ego means you have
surrendered yourself,

266
00:27:16,892 --> 00:27:22,873
no one can cheat you. Can you understand
that?

267
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:35,481
No one can cheat you because there is some
higher force, which is looking after you.

268
00:27:35,682 --> 00:27:39,993
This is the way we should understand
Buddha.

269
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:45,567
This is we should know our Buddha
qualities.

270
00:27:45,768 --> 00:27:53,269
This is how our ego can be dissolved. When
you say, "Mother, we surrender to You,"

271
00:27:53,470 --> 00:28:03,046
that just means that you give this horrible
ego a complete holiday.

272
00:28:03,645 --> 00:28:09,967
It means that. That is how this ego
disappears.

273
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,763
I think all your, your… just now,

274
00:28:15,964 --> 00:28:21,274
your Agnyas are opened out, most of you,
somehow.

275
00:28:21,537 --> 00:28:24,861
And then you'll laugh at everything;

276
00:28:25,062 --> 00:28:31,094
you'll make fun of yourself; just enjoy
everything.

277
00:28:33,101 --> 00:28:37,912
16. THE QUALITY OF VIRATANGANA

278
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:45,717
Last but not the least, one must understand
that as all

279
00:28:45,918 --> 00:28:54,026
the seven chakras I am working on are
in a collective way held by Me, by Virata.

280
00:28:54,227 --> 00:28:58,445
The quality of Viratangana is that,
that She creates

281
00:28:58,646 --> 00:29:05,865
this universal awareness within us –
the collectivity;

282
00:29:06,863 --> 00:29:13,225
and if you do not realize that in modern
times we are

283
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:20,622
in a spiritual path, in a collective way
only.

284
00:29:23,516 --> 00:29:29,009
This is what it is, because we have reached
to the state of Sahasrara,

285
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:39,392
and here we have to have a collective
working only, there’s no other way out.

286
00:29:40,058 --> 00:29:46,990
This is the most important point we must
know: if we cannot be collective –

287
00:29:47,691 --> 00:29:52,559
because of anything, jealousy maybe,
inferiority complex maybe, any, anything

288
00:29:52,736 --> 00:29:56,981
which is coming from behind like a worm
crawling up –

289
00:29:57,182 --> 00:30:02,616
then know that something wrong with you
 nothing wrong with the collectivity.

290
00:30:03,256 --> 00:30:07,483
I hope you’ll understand My vision and
you’ll stand by Me,

291
00:30:07,725 --> 00:30:13,737
and you’ll come up to that. I depend on you
entirely for My vision.

292
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:17,231
We have to change this whole world into
a beautiful place,

293
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:21,642
and for that not much sacrifice is needed.

294
00:30:21,843 --> 00:30:24,897
You’re already blessed, you don’t have
to do much;

295
00:30:25,113 --> 00:30:31,926
only thing is keep your attention
on the Source of power.

296
00:30:32,127 --> 00:30:35,519
May God bless you.

297
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:45,527
Thank you. Matthias says, “We promise.”
Will you all say that?

298
00:30:45,728 --> 00:30:49,639
(Audience: “We promise, Shri Mataji.”)

299
00:30:58,571 --> 00:31:01,888
Thank you very much.
