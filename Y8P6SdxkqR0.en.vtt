00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:15.423
Now be confident that you have powers.

00:00:15.543 --> 00:00:27.435
And this is the new change that is going
to come within your own understanding.

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:32.363
So far only you knew that you could feel the vibrations,

00:00:32.483 --> 00:00:38.258
that you could cure people, you could help to cure -

00:00:38.378 --> 00:00:47.697
I mean, still not so confident that you could feel the Paramchaitanya.

00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:55.475
But you did not know what dynamic Forces are working in you now

00:00:55.595 --> 00:01:00.074
and this is the new change that is going to come.

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:04.968
With this new change, you have to assume a new character,

00:01:05.088 --> 00:01:08.654
and the new character is announcement.

00:01:08.774 --> 00:01:16.260
So far I had told you not to talk about Sahaja Yoga very openly, blatantly,

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.122
but now the time has come. We waited long for these days.

00:01:22.242 --> 00:01:25.627
Now you have to all start talking about it,

00:01:25.747 --> 00:01:29.392
announcing about it and telling about it to everyone.

00:01:29.512 --> 00:01:35.914
Otherwise, the world would say that, “We never knew about it!”

00:01:36.034 --> 00:01:43.205
All other false gurus are so well known all over because their disciples

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:47.241
are talking about them [in] all the places, wherever they can.

00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:52.447
To all the big offices they go, to big people they go.

00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:57.733
They go to all the important people.
[They] just go and tell them what they have.

00:01:57.853 --> 00:02:01.719
So far we had kept Sahaja Yoga at a low ebb

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:05.829
because I wanted you, first of all, to develop

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:12.541
into really very beautiful sahaja yogis, so that from your life,

00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:18.957
from your lifestyle, from your behaviour, from your understanding,

00:02:19.077 --> 00:02:25.737
from your thoughts, people will realise that these people are very unique

00:02:27.034 --> 00:02:31.913
and very different type of people.

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:38.874
Now that assumption has to be there.

00:02:38.994 --> 00:02:46.210
You have to understand that all these powers are bubbling in you

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.871
and just out of formality or maybe out of shyness

00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:57.045
or maybe little cowardice, you are hiding them.

00:02:57.165 --> 00:03:05.003
You can do so many things to convince yourself that you have these powers.

00:03:05.123 --> 00:03:09.397
I have seen people who have certain problems.

00:03:09.517 --> 00:03:13.251
They have a headache, they have this, that. They come to me,

00:03:13.371 --> 00:03:18.550
write big letters, “Mother, I get my headache. I can’t get rid of it.”

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.007
Now those days are gone when Mother has to cure your headache,

00:03:23.127 --> 00:03:28.983
look after your wife, look after your children. Is all finished now.

00:03:29.103 --> 00:03:34.162
Now you are responsible, not only for yourself,

00:03:34.282 --> 00:03:41.782
but for your ashrams, for your cities,

00:03:41.902 --> 00:03:47.024
for your countries and for the whole world.

00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:50.344
Now, assume your powers.

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:56.480
Like yesterday he sang, or he played, ‘The Royal Court’ (Nishat Khan).

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.333
So now you are in The Royal Court. Take up your responsibilities!

00:04:01.453 --> 00:04:07.954
Everybody has to feel responsible. And assume what you are.

00:04:08.074 --> 00:04:13.292
Know your powers, what you can do. Sit down.

00:04:13.412 --> 00:04:17.703
Now, the days are gone when you had to sit down and count your blessings.

00:04:17.823 --> 00:04:20.882
Now you have to count your powers:

00:04:21.002 --> 00:04:26.529
“How many powers I have and what I can use and how I can use.”

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:30.388
No use counting your miracles. You have had enough miracles to prove

00:04:30.508 --> 00:04:35.786
that you are sahaja yogis and that you are helped by the Paramchaitanya.

00:04:35.906 --> 00:04:38.688
But now know how much of that Paramachaitanya

00:04:38.808 --> 00:04:42.734
you are going to use yourself, how you are going to manoeuvre it

00:04:42.854 --> 00:04:46.373
and how you are going to work out.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:54.239
This is the New Era we are starting from today.

00:04:54.359 --> 00:04:59.833
And this is the day I was waiting for all of you to realise

00:04:59.953 --> 00:05:04.121
that you are not sahaja yogis for only your selfish ends,

00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:09.353
nor for your families, nor for your communities,

00:05:09.473 --> 00:05:12.584
nor for your country, but for the whole world.

00:05:12.704 --> 00:05:16.755
Expand yourself. You must have that vision before you,

00:05:16.875 --> 00:05:20.401
that I have put many a times before you people,

00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:23.448
that – you have to emancipate the humanity.

00:05:23.568 --> 00:05:26.244
Now don’t have diffidence.

00:05:26.364 --> 00:05:31.119
First of all, you should not think that, “We are very ordinary people.

00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:35.529
We are very ordinary. We haven’t got something special about it.”

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:38.077
This work is not going to be done by special people

00:05:38.197 --> 00:05:42.029
because they are suffering from ego.

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:45.794
It is going to be done by people who don’t have that ego

00:05:45.914 --> 00:05:52.708
of great success or of great achievements or riches or anything.

00:05:52.828 --> 00:05:57.030
If they are rid of this, then only they can work it out.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.636
And that’s why it is for you to understand what Christ has said

00:06:01.756 --> 00:06:13.195
that a camel can pass through the hole of a needle, but not a rich man.

00:06:13.315 --> 00:06:16.963
Because the ego is too big, bigger than a camel, bigger than an elephant,

00:06:17.083 --> 00:06:20.741
any animal you could think of.

00:06:20.861 --> 00:06:25.615
That’s why now as we are entering into new awareness,

00:06:25.735 --> 00:06:32.677
let us not worry about our negative thinking.

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:39.702
So, first is the diffidence: “How can I be? I am not all right.

00:06:39.822 --> 00:06:45.015
I was like this. I was doing like this. I had done like this.”

00:06:45.135 --> 00:06:47.947
So many letters of confessions come to me,

00:06:48.067 --> 00:06:52.061
pages after pages, which I throw away or burn them off.

00:06:52.181 --> 00:06:55.565
There is no need to confess any more. There’s only one confession,

00:06:55.685 --> 00:06:59.816
that “I am a sahaja yogi and now, after twenty-first of Sahasrara,

00:06:59.936 --> 00:07:03.097
I am a Maha Yogi.”

00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:07.125
This is the confession you have to make.

00:07:07.245 --> 00:07:11.382
And no more of all these out-of-date things that people tell me

00:07:11.502 --> 00:07:15.341
about your family’s life and all mundane, nonsensical things.

00:07:15.461 --> 00:07:18.925
We have given them up and we have come to Sahaja Yoga for our ascent.

00:07:19.045 --> 00:07:24.064
We have achieved our ascent and now for what? For what?

00:07:24.184 --> 00:07:29.540
Have achieved our ascent is to emancipate human beings,

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:37.433
to help them out of the mire of ignorance, of darkness.

00:07:37.553 --> 00:07:46.686
The main target, I feel today, should not
be so much political as fundamentalism.

00:07:46.806 --> 00:07:49.973
So we have to openly say to these fundamentalists

00:07:50.093 --> 00:07:52.199
that, “You are nonsensical. You don’t know the truth.

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:55.985
You don’t know anything about truth.
You don’t know that you are the Spirit.

00:07:56.105 --> 00:07:58.262
You don’t know that there is a power that is working.”

00:07:58.382 --> 00:08:02.080
You have to tell them very clearly, “You are all stupid people

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.146
running after something that is a mirage

00:08:05.266 --> 00:08:09.468
and all of you will end up into hell as described by all the scriptures.”

00:08:09.588 --> 00:08:12.377
We have to openly say it, this thing.

00:08:12.497 --> 00:08:14.262
Whichever way you like, you may write books.

00:08:14.382 --> 00:08:17.052
You may publish it. You may tell people about it.

00:08:17.172 --> 00:08:20.038
But now the new announcement has to come to say

00:08:20.158 --> 00:08:26.485
that running after falsehood is not going to take you to God.

00:08:26.605 --> 00:08:31.614
And, in that, they have used the power of hatred.

00:08:31.734 --> 00:08:34.527
So you have to say that, “We believe in the power of love

00:08:34.647 --> 00:08:37.772
and not in the power of hatred that you believe in.”

00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:42.719
For us, everybody is capable of finding the Truth

00:08:42.839 --> 00:08:52.728
and is capable of getting to the heaven of that paradise,

00:08:52.848 --> 00:08:56.037
which is promised to us, the Kingdom of God.

00:08:56.157 --> 00:09:00.739
So, for us, everybody, whether they
belong to this community, that community,

00:09:00.859 --> 00:09:05.251
this race or that race, whatever it is, we believe –

00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:11.087
not that – but we are sure, that we all are quite capable

00:09:11.207 --> 00:09:16.244
and blessed by God, that we should enter into His Kingdom.

00:09:16.364 --> 00:09:22.435
If you take this kind of a positive attitude, your negativity will go away.

00:09:22.555 --> 00:09:25.527
Negative forces, as you know, you have been pulled down

00:09:25.647 --> 00:09:31.501
by this kind of a thing or that kind of
a thing, specially after Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:31.621 --> 00:09:34.487
Before Sahaja Yoga, we are not attached to any families or anything.

00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:39.230
After Sahaja Yoga you just got attached
to your families, like glued to them.

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:43.380
Absolutely glued. I mean, I had to solve everybody’s family problems.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:48.957
But now, now you do feel that freedom, complete freedom.

00:09:49.077 --> 00:09:52.233
You are an individual. You are absolutely free

00:09:52.353 --> 00:09:55.319
and the source of your joy is your Spirit.

00:09:55.439 --> 00:09:57.602
You are not entangled with anyone.

00:09:57.722 --> 00:10:00.613
You are not any way attached to anyone.

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:04.560
In that detachment, you are going to nourish everyone,

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.984
inclusive of so-called your family, your people,

00:10:08.104 --> 00:10:10.988
your country and ultimately the world.

00:10:11.108 --> 00:10:19.306
So, to get rid of negativity, first important thing is to learn detachment.

00:10:19.426 --> 00:10:22.651
Detachment comes through thoughtless awareness.

00:10:22.771 --> 00:10:26.028
When you look at anyone or start thinking about anyone –

00:10:26.148 --> 00:10:28.906
get to your state of thoughtless awareness.

00:10:29.026 --> 00:10:34.535
Immediately you’ll feel detached and
you’ll know the solution of the whole problem.

00:10:34.655 --> 00:10:40.058
Now the greatest power you have is in
your brain, that you are knowledgeable.

00:10:40.178 --> 00:10:42.554
Not knowledgeable the way you understand,

00:10:42.674 --> 00:10:45.725
that, “what is the chakra, what is the centre” — not that.

00:10:45.845 --> 00:10:48.227
But there is all knowledge within you.

00:10:48.347 --> 00:10:52.690
Just you have to get into thoughtless awareness

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:55.808
and the whole library of knowledge can open to you.

00:10:55.928 --> 00:10:59.774
You know, so many of you have never been speaking on the stage,

00:10:59.894 --> 00:11:04.145
they had stage fear, and you have become great speakers.

00:11:04.265 --> 00:11:08.632
So many of you were possessed people who couldn’t even stand before me,

00:11:08.752 --> 00:11:13.684
have now become leaders and are doing good job.

00:11:13.804 --> 00:11:17.918
In every field you will find that you have advanced so much.

00:11:18.038 --> 00:11:21.499
So many people who never knew how to sing have started singing,

00:11:21.619 --> 00:11:23.956
did not know how to paint have started painting.

00:11:24.076 --> 00:11:27.958
But these are very, very mundane things

00:11:28.078 --> 00:11:31.409
which may give us little pleasures here and there,

00:11:31.529 --> 00:11:36.116
but the main thing is how many people we give Realisation to.

00:11:36.236 --> 00:11:38.582
Whether you are a woman, whether you are man,

00:11:38.702 --> 00:11:41.138
whether you are a father, whether you are a mother,

00:11:41.258 --> 00:11:44.610
whether you are a child or a grown up.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.825
Everybody has to see how many people we can give Realisation to,

00:11:48.945 --> 00:11:53.738
how much we can announce about Sahaja Yoga. That’s the main thing.

00:11:53.858 --> 00:11:56.817
Sahaja Yoga is not by the way. And it happens.

00:11:56.937 --> 00:11:59.733
Like, when I went to Australia, I was surprised

00:11:59.853 --> 00:12:03.392
that Sahaja Yoga, which was such a prime thing for them,

00:12:03.512 --> 00:12:08.320
suddenly became by the way. So Sahaja Yoga is a commitment,

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.661
is a commitment and complete involvement.

00:12:11.781 --> 00:12:15.340
Otherwise you are really useless for Sahaja Yoga, absolutely useless.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.222
It’s better to have few people who are committed

00:12:18.342 --> 00:12:21.728
than to have thousands who are just useless.

00:12:21.848 --> 00:12:25.698
So let us see what you have decided for yourself

00:12:25.818 --> 00:12:28.807
and what you have decided for Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:28.927 --> 00:12:31.301
If you have decided to opt for Sahaja Yoga,

00:12:31.421 --> 00:12:35.604
then just know that this is the main thing which you have to do.

00:12:35.724 --> 00:12:38.960
The whole attention should be on that.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.785
As I told this morning, a very good poem written by Namadeva

00:12:43.905 --> 00:12:48.789
and was included in the Guru Granth Sahib,

00:12:48.909 --> 00:12:52.633
that, “A boy is playing with his kite and the kite is flying in the air.

00:12:52.753 --> 00:12:57.704
He’s talking to everyone, but his attention is on the kite.

00:12:57.824 --> 00:13:01.010
There’s a lady who is doing all the household work.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:04.870
She is doing all the cleaning, but the child is on her,

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:10.479
on her back or on her waist. All her attention is on the child.

00:13:10.599 --> 00:13:13.475
Then there are ladies who are taking water home.

00:13:13.595 --> 00:13:18.409
There’s a water pitcher on their heads, sometimes two, sometimes three.

00:13:18.529 --> 00:13:22.059
They’re carrying, balancing it. They’re talking to each other, laughing,

00:13:22.179 --> 00:13:24.256
but the whole attention is on the balance.”

00:13:24.376 --> 00:13:28.962
In the same way, your attention should be all the time on Sahaja Yoga –

00:13:29.082 --> 00:13:32.447
“What’s happening in Sahaja Yoga? Where are we? Where are we going?

00:13:32.567 --> 00:13:37.181
Where is Mother? What part She is? What is She doing?”

00:13:38.876 --> 00:13:46.256
That is, now, if you put your attention to,
your negativity will absolutely disappear

00:13:46.376 --> 00:13:50.404
because attention which was involved into negative things

00:13:50.524 --> 00:13:55.901
will get absolutely detached and you’ll start thinking about Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:56.021 --> 00:14:00.326
So now, as you are Maha Yogis, we have to make it a Mahayoga.

00:14:00.446 --> 00:14:03.497
And unless and until that level is achieved by you,

00:14:03.617 --> 00:14:06.077
then we should think that you are still backdated

00:14:06.197 --> 00:14:13.280
and I don’t know, in the turning of the wheel, how many will be left there.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.910
There’s not much to be done outside. It is the inside

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:21.058
where we’ll have to prepare ourselves fully, to accept ourselves,

00:14:21.178 --> 00:14:25.539
to tell ourselves every day that we are now Maha Yogis

00:14:25.659 --> 00:14:27.990
and we have to work it out that way.

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:30.974
Today we have here people from all over the world

00:14:31.094 --> 00:14:34.295
and you go and tell this message to all the rest of the people,

00:14:34.415 --> 00:14:38.433
whom I have not met, that “Mother has already announced,

00:14:38.553 --> 00:14:43.714
through the Vishnumaya also, that you all have become now Maha Yogis.”

00:14:43.834 --> 00:14:51.445
And try to express that, manifest that with full confidence in yourself

00:14:51.565 --> 00:14:55.656
and with this power of love, I am sure you will all win over.

00:14:55.776 --> 00:14:57.518
May God bless you all.
