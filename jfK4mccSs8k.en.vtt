00:00:03.407 --> 00:00:08.730
I'm surprised sometimes when I hear the
people [how] they talk in the buses, in the taxies,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.804
in the things; the way they use language
is, you see, is something I can’t understand.

00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:16.036
So I have asked them that the
language should be full of love

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:18.704
and with our own traditional style, the way…

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:25.470
You see, we wouldn’t even scold our children. If
you have to scold the children, we use a language

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.470
which makes them over honourable (Bahumanarthi)

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.270
Damle Sahab has put on a kurta pyjama, so,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.637
“You are looking like Shivaji
Maharaj. Welcome Shivaji Maharaj.”

00:00:41.717 --> 00:00:45.470
We should speak in such respectful
language so that they would not get scared.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.770
Correction if it is to be done],
we used to do it this way;

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.604
but the correction of the other side is
not proper because that never it corrects.

00:00:54.684 --> 00:00:57.203
You see, that’s why you cannot control your children.

00:00:57.283 --> 00:01:02.337
You are all the time insulting them,
insulting others, insulting methods, you see,

00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:08.470
and this emotional blackmail and all this
nonsense is not at all traditional in this country.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.804
And those who’ll try to do it will be thrown out.

00:01:10.884 --> 00:01:13.303
I can tell you, in Sahaja Yoga you cannot work out.

00:01:13.383 --> 00:01:17.337
You should not have all
these ideas of insulting people,

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:21.537
of bringing them into situations where
they can be insulted. This is all modern style.

00:01:21.617 --> 00:01:24.804
So we should not do like that in Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:29.670
We should behave in such a way
that we should be dignified people.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.670
Behoving our style is our tradition,
is Sahaja Yogis’ tradition is this

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.203
that we talk to people in the
most sophisticated manner,

00:01:38.283 --> 00:01:44.303
in the sweetest manner, in the most
affectionate manner and inviting manner.

00:01:44.383 --> 00:01:46.566
And that is how we all should speak.
